 Sex, Drugs, and ADHD: The Effects of ADHD
Pharmacological Treatment on Teens’ Risky Behaviors
February 25, 2016
Abstract
In the U.S., 8% of children are diagnosed with ADHD and 70% are taking medi-
cations, yet little evidence exists on the effects of ADHD treatment on children’s out-
comes. We use a panel of South Carolina Medicaid claims data to investigate the effects
of ADHD drugs on the probability of risky sexual behavior outcomes (STDs and preg-
nancy), substance abuse disorders, and injuries. To overcome potential endogeneity,
we instrument for treatment using physicians’ preferences to prescribe medication. Our
findings suggest that pharmacological treatment has substantial benefits. It reduces the
probability of contracting an STD by 3.6 percentage points (7.7 percentage points if we
include STD screening), reduces the probability of having a substance abuse disorder
by 12.5 percentage points, reduces the probability of injuries by 3.1 percentage points
per year, and associated with them Medicaid costs decrease by $122, or 0.07 standard
deviation.

Introduction
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the common chronic mental
conditions affecting children. In the U.S., 11% of children age 4-17 (6.4 million) are estimated
to have an ADHD diagnosis and almost 70% of them report taking medication for the
condition (e.g. Visser et al. (2014)). However, little evidence exists on the effects of ADHD
treatment on children’s outcomes.
The two most recently published studies produce mixed evidence on the effects of
ADHD treatment.
Currie et al. (2014) find that taking stimulant medication is associ-
ated with a deterioration in academic outcomes and relationship with parents. In contrast,
Dalsgaard et al. (2014) show that treatment is associated with fewer hospital visits and a
reduction in the number of interactions with the police.
Our paper has three major contributions to this literature. First, we are building on our
earlier work to investigate the effects of ADHD medication treatment on a seldom studied set
of outcomes associated with this condition: adolescent risky behaviors and the incidence of
injuries (Chorniy (2015)). The occurrence of injuries allows us to evaluate short-term effects
of ADHD treatment, while substance abuse and risky sexual behavior outcomes speak for
the long-term effects of medication.
Second, we use Medicaid spending on treatment of
these negative events to evaluate the impact of ADHD drugs on the severity of ADHD, and
compare the cost of ADHD treatment with the costs of negative health events. Finally, we
provide innovative supporting evidence in favor of using provider propensity to prescribe as
an instrument for medical treatment. Variants of this instrument were employed in the work
by Dalsgaard et al. (2014) and Duggan (2005), as discussed in Section 5.
We use a panel data set of South Carolina Medicaid claims paid out in 2003-2013. Our
sample of diagnosed and undiagnosed children includes an average of 257,000 enrollees per
year, or nearly 50% of all beneficiaries and over 25% of all SC children and teens. Children
enrolled in Medicaid are disproportionately diagnosed with ADHD. Between 2003 and 2011,
the average incidence of ADHD in South Carolina was 12.6%.1 However, for children and
teens enrolled in Medicaid, the average rate in these years was 19.7%. Although we are
unable to make a statement on the effectiveness of ADHD treatment in general population,
our sample represents a large fraction of the state population, and an even higher fraction
of diagnosed children. Since children on Medicaid are disproportionately diagnosed with
ADHD and their incentives are distorted in the absence of a drug price tag, this population
is arguably more appropriate for this study from a policy perspective.

States, 2003—2011.”

 Nearly 80% of SC Medicaid children and teens are taking ADHD drugs. Consistent
with the national trend, our data also show a steep increase in Medicaid spending on ADHD
prescription drugs. Between 2003 and 2013 spending on ADHD prescription drugs rose by
296% in 2013 dollars. This increase in spending is a consequence of both the increase in the
number of prescriptions filled and the prices of the drugs. The number of patients who take
ADHD medications rose by 68% and the number of prescriptions per person went up by 18%
suggesting that the overall trend is driven by the extensive margin.2
Our results suggest that pharmacological treatment reduces the probability of ev-
ery negative health and behavioral outcome that we identified in the data. Our preferred
specification shows that if a patient is treated with ADHD medication the probability of con-
tracting an STD decreases by 3.6 percentage points (7.7 percentage points if we include STD
screening), having a substance abuse disorder decreases by 12.5 percentage points, getting
injured by 3.1 percentage points each year and annual injury spending decreases by $122,
or 0.07 standard deviation.3 Finally, the probability of teenage pregnancy decreases by 3.7
percentage points, though the effect is not statistically significant.

Background and previous research
2.1
ADHD and ADHD-associated negative health outcomes
The American Psychiatric Association defines ADHD as a neurodevelopmental condi-
tion present if either six or more of the inattention symptoms or six or more hyperactivity-
impulsivity symptoms “have persisted for a least 6 months to a degree that is maladaptive
and inconsistent with developmental level.”4 Inattentive symptoms include difficulty holding
attention on tasks, following instructions, and distractibility among others. Hyperactivity
and impulsivity criteria include excessive talking, difficulty waiting, and fidgeting. Causes
of ADHD are not fully understood but genes are recognized as a major determinant of the
condition.
ADHD may adversely impact major life activities from childhood to adulthood. Earlier
studies have found that untreated ADHD could have severe consequences and be distressing
2There is some evidence of ADHD being increasingly misdiagnosed (e.g. Evans et al. (2010), Elder (2010),
and Schwandt and Wuppermann (2015) among others). This question is out of scope of this paper. If there
are false positive cases of ADHD diagnosis in our sample, our estimates of the effect of ADHD treatment on
negative health outcomes outcomes can be interpreted as a lower bound of the actual effect of medication.

4The American Psychiatric Association publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM), where it sets criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is the standard classification of
mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the United States. The most current version is
DSM-5 published in May 2013, a revision of DSM-IV-TR that came out in 2000.

 not only for children who suffer from the condition but also for their families (Kvist et al.
(2013), Fletcher and Wolfe (2009)), siblings (Breining (2014)), friends, peers (Aizer (2008)),
and teachers (Barkley (2006)). Children with ADHD tend to have problems with self-control
and discount the future more heavily than their unaffected peers. This makes them more
injury-prone5 and more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as: dangerous driving,6
substance use and abuse,7 and risky sexual behaviors.8 Children growing up with ADHD
were found to be more likely to experience teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs), depression, and personality disorders as adults.
These health and behavioral outcomes can be explained in the theoretical framework
of investment in child well-being. Every child is born with a multidimensional endowment of
abilities. They include cognitive (e.g. IQ, memory) and noncognitive skills (e.g. self-control,
patience, and time preference)(Conti and Heckman (2014)). Due to their genetic condition,
children who suffer from ADHD have a relatively low initial stock of noncognitive skills.
The literature on child development indicates that gaps in abilities that form early in life
persist into adulthood and can explain a large array of differentials in adult outcomes. Conti
and Heckman (2014) provide an extensive review of the empirical evidence on the effects of
investment in the two dimensions of child human capital, cognitive and noncognitive skills,
on educational attainment, asocial and risky behaviors, and health. Heckman et al. (2006)
find that both cognitive and noncognitive abilities affect wages, schooling, work experience,
occupational choice, and participation in a range of adolescent risky behaviors. These results
5Besides having more frequent injuries, these children also tend to have more severe injuries than their peers
(Barkley (2006), Swensen et al. (2004), and Marcus et al. (2008)). In a recent study, Dalsgaard et al.
(2015) show that children with ADHD have a higher risk of injuries, but it declines in patients treated with
stimulant medications.
6One of the strongest findings in the medical literature is that ADHD adolescents are more likely be involved
in a car accident and they are more often at fault in such accidents (Barkley (2006), Weiss and Hechtman
(1993)).
7Looby (2008) provides a review of major studies on the association of ADHD and substance use and abuse,
including alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. Some of them find that teens with ADHD are on average more
likely than individuals without ADHD to smoke, use and abuse alcohol and drugs, and develop health
problems related to these activities. However, others conclude that there are additional related conditions
that contribute to the likelihood of these negative health outcomes, e.g. conduct disorder symptoms and
association with deviant peers. Despite a disagreement on the relationship between ADHD and substance
use, Looby (2008) review suggests that ADHD treatment reduces the risk of substance use disorders in
children with ADHD. Using a meta-analysis, Wilens et al. (2003) also find that stimulant medications
reduce the risk for subsequent drug and alcohol use disorders.
8Adolescents with untreated ADHD have difficulty controlling their impulses and planning ahead. These
teens also tend to struggle with low self-esteem and for that reason, teenage girls often seek affirmation
of boys through sexual attention (Arnold (1996)). Adolescent girls’ symptoms of ADHD often worsen due
to the hormonal changes at puberty (Resnick (2005)). Their condition makes them more likely to become
sexually active earlier than their peers, have more partners on average, and use birth control inconsistently
(Kessler et al. (1997), Payne (2014)). This association is also found in a more recent study by Sarver et al.
(2014).

 have important policy implications, but most interventions do not directly target children’s
noncognitive abilities. The Perry Preschool experiment may be an exception; it did not
result in IQ improvements but instead had a beneficial impact on many child outcomes.
Heckman et al. (2006) argue that these beneficial impacts were achieved by altering social
skills.
In this paper, we focus on a variety of negative health outcomes associated with ADHD:
injuries, substance use, and risky sexual behavior. Injury events allow us to evaluate the
short-term effects of ADHD treatment, while the risky behavior related events speak for the
long-term treatment effects.
2.2
Prior Studies
An existing body of medical literature suggests that ADHD medication has positive
impacts on mitigating core symptoms of ADHD, yet little is known about the effects of treat-
ment on health, behavioral, and educational outcomes, particularly in the long run. One of
the major attempts to estimate the long-term effects of ADHD treatment in a clinical setting
was funded by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health in the early 1990s. The Mul-
timodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) randomly assigned
579 ADHD-diagnosed children age 7-9.9 years old to 14 months of treatment management.
The study finds that medication treatment alone and medication treatment combined with
behavioral therapy reduces inattention and hyperactivity, the core symptoms of ADHD.
However, there was little or no difference in academic performance, social skills and parent-
child relationships. An important limitation of the study is that nearly 70% of individuals
assigned to the control group also received medication. Molina et al. (2009) investigates the
effects for these randomized treatment groups 6-8 years following intervention. They find
that the groups do not differ significantly on any repeated measures or new measures of out-
comes: contacts with the police and arrests, delinquent behavior, social skills and academic
performance.
Currie et al. (2014) take advantage of a policy change in Quebec which expanded
insurance coverage for prescription medications to estimate the effect of ADHD treatment
on emotional functioning and academic outcomes. Using data from the 1994-2008 National
Longitudinal Survey of Canadian Youth, they find that stimulant medication treatment is
associated with a decrease in academic outcomes such as grade repetition, math scores,
and the probability of having any post-secondary education for girls, a deterioration in
relationship with parents, and an increase in the probability of depression.
5
 Dalsgaard et al. (2014) exploit the idiosyncratic differences in physician preferences to
prescribe pharmacological treatment to analyze the effects of ADHD treatment on hospital
visits and criminal behavior. Consistent with earlier research (e.g. Duggan (2005)), they find
that prescribing practices vary significantly across medical care providers. This implies that
two children with identical symptoms and characteristics have a different probability of being
diagnosed and treated with medications depending on their physician’s preferences. Using
Danish registers data and provider probability to prescribe as an instrument, Dalsgaard et al.
(2014) find that treatment receipt is associated with fewer hospital visits and fewer police
interactions.
In a recent study, using the same data these authors and a number of co-authors
estimate odds ratios for injuries, mean change in prevalence rates, and ER visits before and
after the treatment with stimulant medication (Dalsgaard et al. (2015)). They find that
children with ADHD have a higher risk of injuries than a non-ADHD group, but it declines
in patients treated with stimulant medication.
We contribute to the existing literature in three ways. First, we look at a seldom stud-
ied set of ADHD-related negative health outcomes: teenage pregnancies, incidence of STDs,
substance abuse disorders, and injuries. To our knowledge, this paper and its dynamic model
companion (Chorniy (2015)) are the first to directly study the effects of ADHD treatment
on these outcomes in health economics literature. Our general conclusions on the effect of
treatment on injuries are consistent with the medical literature (Dalsgaard et al. (2015));
but we are not aware of any comparable studies on the other outcomes.
Second, we take advantage of Medicaid costs reported in the data to estimate the
impact of ADHD medication on the severity of the condition. Medical treatment may be
effective in reducing the severity of negative health outcomes even if the likelihood of having
one is unchanged. Medicaid costs are also useful for policy recommendations. In South
Carolina, out-of-pocket costs for Medicaid enrollees under 19 years old are zero or negligible.
This distorts the patients’ incentives and puts the burden of cost-benefit analysis on policy-
makers. Medicaid investment in ADHD treatment might be balanced via a reduction in its
spending on the ADHD-associated events. We briefly examine this question in the current
work and leave the detailed study to future research.
Finally, we provide innovative supporting evidence in favor of using provider propensity
to prescribe as an instrument for medical treatment. Its variants were employed in the work
by Dalsgaard et al. (2014) and Duggan (2005).
Our data allow us to construct a more
precise measure of provider preferences and test whether there is evidence of the instrument
being correlated with provider quality and whether there is evidence of provider shopping.
For robustness, we also provide comparative results across a variety of instruments and

Data
We use a large panel data set of South Carolina Medicaid claims that spans 11 years
from 2003 to 2013. It includes 145,264 children and teenagers who had at least one ADHD-
related claim between 3 and 18 years old during this time period. This sample makes up
approximately 20% of the children population in the state.
Our data include basic demographic information collected to determine Medicaid eli-
gibility and a complete set of health services utilization records for all individuals: hospital,
outpatient, and pharmacy claims.9 It is supplemented by several variables from the enrollees’
birth certificates including mother’s age, race, and education. Following earlier research work
that used Medicaid or other administrative claims data (e.g. Frank et al. (2004)), we compile
a set of ICD-9 diagnosis codes10 and CPT procedure codes11 to identify individuals who have
ADHD, cases of pregnancy, STDs, substance use and abuse disorders,12 and injuries13 from
the insurance claims data. Administrative data are not well-suited for distinguishing two
consecutive independent events of the same kind from continuous care for the same event.
For this reason, we focus on the first occurrence of each negative health outcome: teenage
pregnancy, STD contraction, STD screening, and substance use and abuse disorders. While
we use the first observed negative health outcome event to identify the incidence of negative
health outcomes, we track all Medicaid spending related to these events across time.14
We use pharmacy claims to extract information on ADHD prescription medications
that were filled by a patient. Each record has a dispense date, National Drug code (NDC),15
9Medicaid has two components: traditional fee-for-service (FFS) and services provided through managed
care organizations (MCO). Due to the differences in reporting requirements, the complete information on
all services provided to a patient are only available for those enrolled in the FFS plan. However, mental
health is one of the “carved-out” conditions that is covered by the FFS component even if an individual
is enrolled into a managed care plan. We use all available claims and when possible, perform robustness
checks by excluding MCO enrollees.
10The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes are
used by Medicaid for reporting purposes in the years covered by our sample. A hospital claim may have
up to 9 diagnosis codes and an outpatient claim may have up to 4 codes.
11The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes are used to indicate services provided to a patient. A
hospital claim may have up to 100 procedure codes and an outpatient claim may have up to 8 codes.
12For substance use and abuse disorders we use a methodology developed in Bouchery et al. (2012).
13The ICD-9 codes for injuries were borrowed from Marcus et al. (2008).
14We disregard any out-of-pocket expenditures in this study. In 2013, most eligible individuals faced a small
copay per doctor visit ($3.30), per prescription ($3.40 for adults over 19 years old and zero otherwise), and
per hospital stay ($25).

drugs. Under this system, different package and dosage sizes of the same drug molecule have separate

 quantity purchased, dispense fee, and the amount paid by Medicaid. We use our previous
work (Chorniy (2015)) to identify drugs that are typically prescribed to patients with ADHD
and to construct our instrumental variable (Section 4).
To estimate our model, we put a number of restrictions on the original data set. First,
we select individuals who are consistently enrolled for Medicaid for a year or more for us
to be able to estimate the effect of treatment.
For lapses in enrollment that last under
three months, we assume that patients are enrolled but receive no medical treatment.16 For
inconsistent eligibility periods that result in longer lapses in coverage (48% of the enrollees),
we only keep medical history prior to the lapse. These criteria leave us with 107,062 Medicaid
enrollees.
Second, due to the fact that our instrument is constructed using the event of the initial
ADHD diagnosis, we exclude individuals for whom we are unable to identify this event.
Based on the earlier literature (e.g. Crawford and Shum (2005)), these are patients who
had their first ADHD-related visit within 180 days from their first appearance in the sample
and patients who fill a prescription prior to their first observed ADHD-related provider visit.
This restriction excludes additional 29,974 individuals from the sample.
Additionally, a
patient had to be diagnosed between 3 and 18 years old and be in the sample for at least one
full year since the event of the first ADHD diagnosis to be included in the analysis; 62,643
patients satisfied this criteria. Our final sample has 58,685 individuals after excluding ADHD
children with missing basic demographic information and children for whom we were unable
to calculate provider propensity to prescribe.17
Table 1 shows summary statistics on individual, mother, and home environment char-
acteristics.
Boys comprise 66% of the sample; whites and blacks are represented nearly
equally. On average, children are first diagnosed with ADHD at 8 years old, and half of
them are diagnosed by age of 7. Nationwide, among children age 4-17 years whose parents
reported “mild” ADHD symptoms the median age of diagnosis is 7.0 years old, 6.1 years for
those with “moderate” symptoms, and 4.4 years for “severe” cases of ADHD. Given that the
population we are looking at is slightly older, our statistic is generally consistent with that
reported in the Visser et al. (2014).
The families predominantly consist of a single adult and two children. Their reported
net monthly income is $574 on average. Data on mother’s characteristics from the in-state
16Once eligibility for Medicaid is established, the health insurance coverage is available for an enrollee for
a 12-month period (unless the enrollee becomes ineligible during this time), after which the eligibility
needs to be reconfirmed. An eligible individual who received services prior to the actual enrollment can
be covered retroactively for up to two months prior to the month when eligibility was established.
17We are unable to calculate a provider propensity to prescribe for providers who diagnose less than 2
patients with ADHD in a year.
8
 birth certificates are matched to 72% of children in our sample. The majority of mothers in
the sample have at least some high-school education (37%) or a high school diploma (40%).
In addition to the entire cohort of children on Medicaid who are diagnosed with ADHD
in SC between 2003-2013, we have a supplemental random sample of children on Medicaid
who were never diagnosed with ADHD.18 We use this sample to test the validity of our
identification strategy (see Section 5). Summary statistics for this group of children are
shown in the appendix (Table 11 and Table 12).
Table 2 reports summary statistics on ADHD medical treatment and ADHD-related
negative health outcomes that we observe in the sample.
Nearly all children diagnosed
with ADHD have attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ICD-9: 314.01) as opposed
to disorder without hyperactivity (ICD-9: 314.00). In our primary specification, we define
pharmacological treatment as one or more prescriptions filled after the diagnosis (79% of
patients). Following earlier literature, we also introduce two alternative definitions. For
example, if we define treatment as a period of at least six month on medication in a given
year (Dalsgaard et al. (2014)), only 52% of our diagnosed children receive treatment.
On average, we observe every Medicaid enrollee for eight years. During this time, 1,811
of them become pregnant before age 19; 3,288 contract an STD and an additional 2,184 are
tested for an STD condition. For 5,864 teens we observe at least one claim that indicates a
substance abuse disorder. The most frequent outcome that we observe yearly are injuries.
Of all ADHD-diagnosed children, 80% of children and teens have at least one injury while
in the sample.
In order to take into account the severity of negative health outcome events, we cal-
culate the total Medicaid spending using the respective claims. The average annual cost of
treatment for an STD condition is $400 ($354 per patient if we include all patients who were
screened for an STD). The annual cost of a substance abuse condition, including spending on
prescribed medications is $1,499 per patient. Finally, the average cost of injuries per person
per year is $704. These expenditures vary widely across patients with the upper tail costing
Medicaid thousands of dollars.19
18It includes eligibility information, hospital, and outpatient claims for the undiagnosed children under 19
years old with higher weights assigned to relevant birth cohorts.
19All spending amounts are adjusted to 2013 dollars.

Notes: The sample includes every SC Medicaid enrollee who was diagnosed with ADHD between 3 and 18 years old in 2003-2013
and who was eligible for Medicaid at least one year after this event. Family characteristics are averaged per patient/eligibility
year.
Foster care and disability rates are calculated based on Medicaid enrollment categories.
Mother characteristics are
reported based on in-state birth certificate information matched to Medicaid records. They are available only for a subsample
of the 42,488 patients. Mother’s age and educational attainment are recorded at the time of the child’s birth. “HS” stands for
high school education level.

Notes: The sample includes every SC Medicaid enrollee who was diagnosed with ADHD between 3 and 18 years old in 2003-2013 and
who was eligible for Medicaid at least one year after this event. Alternative treatment definitions are used for the robustness checks in
Section 10. Annual costs of treatment and negative health outcomes are given in 2013 dollars per patient/year conditional on treatment
or the occurrence of a negative health outcome. They are based on the Medicaid reimbursement. The out-of-pocket patient costs are
nearly zero for the population in our sample.

Empirical Model
4.1
Lifetime Effects of ADHD Treatment
We use a linear probability model to estimate the effects of ADHD medical treatment
on the incidence of adverse health and behavioral outcomes in adolescents who are diagnosed
with the condition. In this experiment, we compare the outcomes of treated and not treated
children with ADHD. We model outcomes as shown in Equation 1.
Yi = Xiβ + αiTreatmenti + γ1Countyi + γ2Y eari + εi
(1)
where Y represents one of the negative health outcomes that are common for individuals
(i) diagnosed with ADHD: STD contraction and STD screening, substance use and abuse,
and teenage pregnancy. X is a vector of covariates that includes observed individual charac-
teristics (race, gender, birth year), net monthly family income at the first ADHD diagnosis,
patient age, and duration of enrollment.20 We also control for the location (county of pa-
tient’s residence at diagnosis) and the year of diagnosis. We exclude all individuals who have
experienced an adverse outcome (STD, STD test, substance abuse, or pregnancy) prior to
their ADHD diagnosis and estimate the model using post-diagnosis medical history.21 For
outcomes STD, STD testing, substance abuse, and teenage pregnancy, we utilize a subsample
of relevant birth cohorts of SC Medicaid enrollees. They are individuals born between 1987
and 1996, whose teen years overlap with our sample period and who are enrolled in Medicaid
for at least one year during this time. Treatment takes a value of one if the individual fills
at least one ADHD prescription after being diagnosed with the condition, as described in
Section 3.
The parameter of interest in this equation is α. In the linear probability model frame-
work, it can be interpreted as the average impact of ever being treated for ADHD on the
likelihood of negative health outcomes in adolescence.
Equation 1 can be rewritten to reflect two potential sources of bias:
Yi = Xiβ + ¯
αTreatmenti + Treatmenti(αi − ¯
α) + γ1Countyi + γ2Y eari + εi
(2)
20The length of the time period the individual was enrolled in Medicaid between 2003 and 2013.
21Note that the baseline IV (“ever treated”) does not exclude the possibility that an individual is be diagnosed,
then experiences an adverse event, and only then is prescribed treatment. There are 75 such cases in our
data. Using the alternative IV that defines treatment as a prescription filled within 365 days from the
initial diagnosis, there are 16 such cases (see Section 7.2).
Since our analysis excludes all individuals
who experience an adverse event prior to their ADHD diagnosis, it cannot be the case that the adverse
event determines the instrument and thus, we will have unbiased estimates of the effect of “ever filling a
prescription” on the probability of adverse events.
12
 There are two potential concerns that arise when estimating Equation 2. First, if
Treatment is correlated with ε, unobserved factors that make some individuals more likely
to receive treatment also influence their health and behavioral outcomes.
For example,
relatively more caring parents might be more likely to pursue medical treatment for their
child.
These parents are also more likely to take measures to reduce the probability of
negative health outcomes associated with ADHD. In this case, our results might be biased
towards finding that ADHD treatment reduces the probability of negative health outcomes.
On the contrary, if perhaps children with the most severe ADHD symptoms are the ones to
seek treatment and are also relatively more likely to experience negative health outcomes,
the effect of medication treatment would be biased towards zero. Second, Treatment will
be correlated with αi if individuals select treatment based on expected gains. In this case,
the child’s outcomes may determine treatment receipt.
4.2
Identification
Following Dalsgaard et al. (2014) and Duggan (2005), we instrument for individual
treatment with provider propensity to prescribe. If two equally sick patients have a different
prescription outcome because they saw physicians with a respectively high or low propen-
sity to prescribe, it provides exogenous variation necessary to evaluate the causal effect of
treatment.
PPdit = N patients treateddt − 1 ∗ (Treateddit = 1)
N patientsdt − 1
(3)
We define provider d’s propensity to prescribe (PP) medication to an individual i in
year t as the share of all his/her patients’ treatment outcomes in a given year, excluding
the focal individual (Equation 3). Specifically, provider propensity to prescribe is equal to
the sum of other patients prescribed medication divided by the sum of all other patients
diagnosed by the same provider in the same year. The focal individual i is excluded from the
calculation of propensity to prescribe. This warrants potential endogeneity concerns since
the patient’s characteristics are not a part of the provider propensity to prescribe measure.
In our data a provider diagnoses 38 patients per year, on average. To be included in our
analysis, we require the provider to diagnose two or more patients per year.
Since we only observe filled prescriptions, our calculated provider’s propensity to pre-
scribe a drug to a patient with ADHD includes both the probability that he/she writes
a prescription and the probability that the patient fills the prescription (Dalsgaard et al.
13
 (2014)). Both the probability that a provider prescribes medication to the patient and the
probability that the patient fills the prescription, conditional on the provider’s engagement
with the patient, are relevant provider variation.22
Stockl et al. (2002) survey 1,000 randomly selected physicians who prescribe stimulant
medication to patients between December 2001 and May 2002. They document considerable
variation in physicians’ perception on the severity of ADHD medication side effects and their
concern about the medication being used for purposes other than patient’s medical needs.
Similar to earlier research, we find that patients face significant variation in the probability
of receiving a prescription (Figure 1).
The first stage is given by Equation 4:
Treatmenti = δPPi + Xiθ + νi
(4)
where PPi is a patient-specific probability to receive a prescription from the diagnosing
provider; Xi is a vector of controls from the Equation 1.
The second stage is given by
Equation 5:
Yi = α
�
Treatmenti + Xiβ + εi
(5)
where
�
Treatmenti is the predicted treatment from Equation 4, and β is the marginal treat-
ment effects of ADHD medication on adolescent’s negative health outcomes. To illustrate our
identification strategy, consider two types of doctors: doctors with a high propensity to pre-
scribe and doctors with a low propensity to prescribe. For very severe cases of ADHD, both
doctors would recommend medication treatment and thus the effect of treatment on chil-
dren’s negative health outcomes cannot be identified. Alternatively, for children with few to
no ADHD symptoms, both doctors would not recommend medication treatment. The com-
parison of outcomes across doctors’ prescribing behaviors would thus focus on the variation
of treatment among marginal cases. Equation 5 will produce consistent estimates provided
that PPi influences treatment and is uncorrelated with the error term εi (see Section 5 for
supporting evidence).
4.3
Yearly Effects of ADHD Treatment
Another way to look at the effects of ADHD treatment on negative health outcomes is
by taking advantage of the panel feature of our data set. It allows us to control for patient’s
age, year-specific trends, and other observed time-varying factors that could have an effect on
22In the earlier literature, physician prescribing practices were found to vary with the reimbursement mech-
anism (Dickstein (2014)) and their individual preferences (Hellerstein (1998)).
14
 Figure 1: Distribution of Provider Propensity to Prescribe
Notes: The figure shows the distribution of the probability that a patient receives a prescription from a particular physician
in the year she was diagnosed based on the sample of 58,685 ADHD-diagnosed patients enrolled in SC Medicaid in 2003-2013.
Provider propensity to prescribe varies from zero to one.
15
 individual health outcomes. For example, age-specific risks of outcomes such as pregnancy,
STD contraction, and substance abuse are in the fixed effects, which reduces the variance in
the error term.
Moreover, this approach requires fewer assumptions about data. While in the “lifetime”
analysis (cross-section setup) it is assumed that an individual had no adverse outcomes if she
is not actively enrolled in Medicaid and has no claims,23 per-year effects are identified strictly
off the observed continuous Medicaid enrollment period. Due to the nature of administrative
records, we are unable to reliably tell apart two separate negative health events of the same
type. Thus, we do not track individuals past their first adverse outcome (except for the
injuries). The empirical model is specified in the Equation 6 below.
Yit = α
�
Treatmenti + Xiβ + Zitγ1 + γ2Countyit + γ3Y earit + γ4Y ear × Countyit + εit (6)
where Y is a negative health outcome for an ADHD patient i in year t;
�
Treatment represents
medical treatment instrumented with provider propensity to prescribe. As in the “lifetime”
effects analysis, treatment is defined as “ever treated” and the instrument itself does not
have a time subscript. X is a vector of controls that includes individual characteristics that
do not vary with time: race, sex, and birth cohort; Z includes time-varying controls: age,
monthly family income; Y ear represents year controls; County stands for the county of
residence;24 Y ear × County are county/year interactions, and ε is a stochastic error term.
Note that we exclude all individuals who have experienced an adverse outcome (STD, STD
test, substance abuse, or pregnancy) prior to their ADHD diagnosis and we estimate the
model using post-ADHD diagnosis medical history. For STD, STD testing, substance abuse,
and teenage pregnancy outcomes we utilize a subsample of individuals born between 1987
and 1996, whose teen years overlap with the time period of our data set.
For the outcomes related to teenagers’ risky behavior, the parameter of interest, α
can be interpreted as the average effect of ever receiving treatment on the first incidence
of a negative health outcome. For the incidence and number of injuries, the coefficient on
treatment can be interpreted as the average annual effect of ever receiving treatment. Ideally,
one would like to know how treatment length or being diagnosed at a certain ages can change
treatment effects. However, we are unable to address the endogeneity issues that arise with
the use of treatment length or age of diagnosis with our instrument. Thus, it is left for the
future research to find an identification strategy that would shed light on these questions.
23See discussion in Section 5.2.4
24For robustness, we use county unemployment rate, county income, and county population density instead
of county controls and our findings hold.

IV Validity
5.1
Condition 1: First Stage Results
The first stage results for the entire sample (Table 3) and the outcome-specific results
(Table 6) show that the relationship between the provider propensity to prescribe ADHD
medication and the probability that the child ever fills a prescription is positive. It holds
when we include a number of controls, such as family and individual characteristics, mother’s
age and education level, county, and birth cohort fixed effects. The estimated magnitude of
the coefficient in the specification that includes all the controls and fixed effects (Table 3,
column 3) suggests that a 10 percentage point increase in the provider propensity to prescribe
is associated with a 3.53 percentage point increase in the probability of treatment receipt.
This relationship does not seem to be driven by the “extreme” values of provider
propensity to prescribe. When we exclude all providers who either never prescribe ADHD
medication or prescribe drugs to every child they diagnose, the first-stage result becomes
stronger.
5.2
Condition 2: Exclusion Restriction
In order for our instrumental variable approach to be valid, the exclusion restriction
must hold. In our data, providers are not randomly assigned to patients but it is necessary
that provider propensity to prescribe affects patient outcomes only through pharmacological
treatment.
In this section, we devise a number of tests that could be indicative of a violation of
this assumption. There are three potential threats that we address and provide suggestive
evidence in favor of the validity of doctor propensity to prescribe. First, provider prescrib-
ing preferences might be correlated with the provider quality and thus, would affect patient
outcomes directly rather than through treatment receipt. Second, both our instrument and
patient outcomes may be correlated with unobserved individual, family, and other charac-
teristics. Finally, there might be a sample selection problem if the individual’s length of
enrollment in Medicaid is related to the provider propensity to prescribe. Although these
tests do not ensure that the exclusion restriction is satisfied, they provide us with more
confidence in that our instrument is valid.

one if the patient had an ADHD prescription while on Medicaid and zero otherwise. Controls that are not shown
include individual’s first county of residence, foster care, and disability status. Mother characteristics include
mother’s age when she gave birth and educational attainment. Family net income is measured in ten thousands
of dollars; the coefficients on the number of adults are scaled up by 10 in order to show the magnitude of the
effect. Coefficient estimates that are significant at 1%, 5%, and 10% level are denoted with a, b, and c respectively.

 5.2.1
Placebo test: provider propensity to prescribe at mean age of ADHD
diagnosis
Physician quality, experience, and training have an impact on patient outcomes. If the
propensity to prescribe medication reflects physician quality, it may confound our results.
For example, it could be the case that providers who prescribe medication to every single one
of their patients do not properly evaluate patient symptoms and/or determine a treatment
strategy that would suit each particular case. In other words, if high prescribing providers
are those of lower quality, we would expect to find that treatment has unfavorable effects on
health outcomes.
To address this concern we devise a placebo test. If provider quality is not related to
his or her propensity to prescribe, we should see no relationship between the instrument and
health outcomes of children who were never diagnosed with ADHD. By definition, this group
has no diagnosing physician in the data. Instead, we identify the first doctor a patient who
was never diagnosed with ADHD saw when he or she was eight years old. It is the mean age
of ADHD diagnosis in our sample of diagnosed children.25
Table 4 presents results for the undiagnosed sample as well as the reduced form re-
gression estimates for the diagnosed sample. The point estimates of the coefficients on the
propensity to prescribe have large confidence intervals suggesting that there is no statistically
significant relationship between provider quality and propensity to prescribe.
5.2.2
Confounding factor: provider selection
Another potential bias may arise if parents of children with relatively severe symptoms
of ADHD seek and use prior information about the provider’s propensity to prescribe. If
they, on average, visit physicians with a relatively high propensity to prescribe, this could
bias our findings of the effects of ADHD medication downward. Similarly, if the parents
of children with relatively less severe ADHD symptoms seek pharmacological treatment, it
could result in an upward bias in our findings.
We do not have a strong prior on the direction of the bias. The medical evidence
on the effectiveness of ADHD medication is mixed and the evidence on long-term effects is
very limited. Additionally, there is a large array of potential side effects associated with
these drugs. They include sleep problems, suppressed appetite, nausea, headaches, stunted
growth, aggression and irritability, and cardiac risks (Barkley (2006)). Parents have to weigh
the expected benefits and costs associated with medicating their child.
25Due to a high provider mobility in and out of Medicaid, we could not match all first-in-sample provider
IDs to the diagnosing provider IDs.

Notes: Panel A and B show the results of the IV validity test. Propensity to prescribe ADHD medication
is constructed by using the individual’s provider at the mean age of ADHD diagnosis for the non-ADHD
sample. The coefficients in Panel A are estimated on the sample of children who do not have ADHD using
OLS. The dependent variables take value of one if a child experienced each of the respective adverse events;
it is zero otherwise. The coefficients in Panel B are from the reduced form equation: regressing the outcome
on doctor propensity to prescribe. Coefficient estimates that are significant at 1%, 5%, and 10% level are
denoted with a, b, and c respectively. Standard errors are in parentheses. They are clustered by individual’s
provider.
20
 Table 5 reports the results on the relationship between physician propensity to pre-
scribe and observed individual, mother, and family characteristics. They include mother’s
age and educational attainment at the time she gave birth, family net income measured at
the individual’s first ADHD diagnosis, the severity of ADHD, and comorbid psychiatric con-
ditions diagnosed prior to ADHD. We find no evidence of a consistent relationship between
these observed characteristics and our instrumental variable except for a tightly-estimated
small effect for the family composition. For example, a family with one child versus two
children would face a doctor with only 0.3 percentage points lower prescribing probability.
Unlike Dalsgaard et al. (2014), we find a very small and statistically insignificant
correlation between family income and provider propensity to prescribe. It is likely due to
the differences in the sample population. Medicaid enrollees are a relatively homogeneous
group income-wise and are well-suited for our research design. Finally, we find no statistically
significant relationship between provider propensity to prescribe and the severity of the
underlying condition approximated by the history of injuries prior to the ADHD diagnosis.
Although there are many unobserved characteristics that could have an impact on the
choice of the ADHD provider, we argue that our test has a significant power. Covariates like
family income and mother’s characteristics have a long history of being used as predictors
of health, parent quality, and other outcomes that we could be potentially concerned about.
5.2.3
Treatment shopping: second provider selection
About 10% patients in our sample (5,734 individuals) switch their health care provider
after being diagnosed with ADHD. If the reason for a switch is to alter their treatment, it
could undermine our research design and create a bias. In particular, the concern is that
patients are shopping for treatment and if the first physician did not prescribe medication,
they would search for a provider who would. For these patients, we look at the relationship
between prescribing practices of the diagnosing physician and their subsequent physician.
Of the individuals that switch providers, 57.6% go to a subsequent provider with a higher
propensity to prescribe than the diagnosing provider, 39.4% go to a subsequent provider with
a lower propensity to prescribe, and 3.0% go to a subsequent provider with a propensity to
prescribe equal to the first diagnosing provider. Approximately 83% of switchers receive
pharmaceutical treatment and 79% of those who do not switch receive pharmaceutical treat-
ment.
Figure 2 plots this relationship. The plot shows no clear linear pattern in the switchers’
behavior, suggesting that individuals who switch to a subsequent provider do so randomly
or for reasons independent of the provider propensity to prescribe. We also look for the
possibility of a nonlinear relationship. The coefficient on the quadratic term is small, positive
21
 and significant (0.07 (0.01)).26 It suggests that for patients who first encounter providers
with “extreme” prescribing preferences (either prescribe to no one or prescribe to all patients)
and switch to another provider, their subsequent provider propensity to prescribe is slightly
higher than average. If we regress the individual decision to switch on an indicator of provider
being “extreme”, we find that their patients are 2 percentage points more likely to switch
providers (Table 13).
Further, we find no evidence of correlation between provider switching and mother’s
education or income (Table 13), and the mean values of mother and family characteristics do
not differ significantly for individuals who go to a higher prescribing subsequent provider in
relationship to individuals who go to a lower prescribing subsequent provider (Table 14). All
these patterns suggest that strategic treatment shopping in our sample is not a significant
issue but it also indicates that patients might be driven away from providers with the extreme
preferences to prescribe ADHD medication.
5.2.4
Provider propensity to prescribe and individual’s length of Medicaid en-
rollment
The final test we perform is concerned with the length an individual is enrolled in
Medicaid. In the data, we observe the individual so long as they are enrolled. If the decision
to enroll in Medicaid is related to doctor propensity to prescribe, it is a potential concern
for the identification strategy.
For example, if a patient was diagnosed by a provider with a relatively high propensity
to prescribe and received medication, it is plausible to suggest that she may remain enrolled
for a longer period of time than otherwise. One might argue that the longer an individual
is enrolled, the more probable it is that we will observe a negative health outcome for
that individual: STD contraction, STD screening, substance abuse disorder, or teenage
pregnancy.27
Positive correlation between doctor propensity to prescribe and enrollment
could bias our results towards finding that pharmaceutical treatment receipt, instrumented
with provider propensity to prescribe, is correlated with worse patient outcomes.
Table 5 shows that the instrument is uncorrelated with the length of Medicaid enroll-
ment. In other words, individuals are not selecting into the sample based on their diagnosing
provider propensity to prescribe.
26The coefficient estimates do not change when controls from our main regression specification are included.
27Due to the easiness of enrollment in Medicaid and including the fact that the program would cover up to two
months of claims retroactively, these adverse outcomes would likely result in an individual re-enrollment
and would not pose a risk for the model identification.

Notes: This table shows two additional tests in support of our instrumental variable. Both regressions
are estimated using OLS and include birth cohort and county fixed effects. Family income is measured
in thousands of dollars; ADHD severity is approximated by the incidence of injuries prior to ADHD
diagnosis. Family characteristics are measured and fixed at the time of the individual’s first ADHD
diagnosis. Coefficient estimates that are significant at 1%, 5%, and 10% level are denoted with a, b, and

Results
We find evidence that ADHD medication treatment reduces the probability and sever-
ity of a wide range of short-term and lifetime negative health outcomes. It is effective in
reducing the probability of an ADHD teenager contracting an STD, becoming pregnant,
suffering from a substance use and abuse disorder, and having an injury.
Tables 6–9 summarize these results.
For every negative health outcome we show
estimated coefficients using IV and OLS for comparison purposes.
In most cases, OLS
estimates agree in the direction of the effect with the IV-estimated coefficients, but they
understate the magnitude of the beneficial effects associated with treatment. Notably, OLS
estimates for the substance abuse and injury outcomes seem to have a larger bias relative
to other outcome measures. The OLS estimates suggest that medical treatment increases
the probability of suffering from a substance abuse disorder and getting injured while the IV
estimates suggest that medical treatment decreases the probability of these negative health
outcomes.
6.1
Lifetime Effects of ADHD Treatment
Table 6 summarizes the results. We find that medication is effective in reducing the
probability of the outcomes produced by risky behaviors. Children with ADHD who received
pharmacological treatment are 3.6 percentage points less likely to be treated for an STD
condition, 7.7 percentage points less likely to be screened for an STD, and 12.5 percentage
points less likely to receive medical attention related to a substance abuse disorder. The
point estimate on the probability of teenage pregnancy is also negative (-3.7 percentage
points) but not statistically significant.28
Compared to the OLS estimates, the coefficients obtained using an IV are of the same
sign for outcomes of STD contraction, STD screening, and teen pregnancy, but are larger in
absolute value and statistically significant for STD contraction and STD testing. In other
words, OLS understates the effects of treatment but indicates that treatment has favorable
effects on outcomes. The OLS estimates for the outcome of substance abuse suggest that
treatment slightly increases the probability of abusing substances. When we instrument for
treatment, we find that the coefficient on treatment flips signs and increases in magnitude
suggesting that treatment decreases the probability that an individual abuses substances.
The results also show that males are less likely to be treated (12.8 percentage points)
28These results generally hold in a smaller sample of patients for whom we have birth certificate data.

education level.

 or screened (20.7 percentage points) for an STD but 5.2 percentage points more likely to have
medical history of substance abuse. This finding is consistent with the reports on STDs.29
For example, the chlamydia case rate per 100,000 females in 2005 was more than three times
higher than for males. Most of this difference is attributed to the fact that women are more
likely to be screened than men. Whites are the most likely to suffer from one of the negative
health outcomes that we focus on, which is also likely to be an outcome of higher probability
of being screened.
Family characteristics that we control for include family composition (number of adults
and children in the individual’s household) as well as family net income at the time of the
child’s diagnosis. The coefficients on these controls are consistent with our prior. Going from
a one to two-adult family decreases the probability of negative health outcomes by 0.6-1.9
percentage points depending on the type of the outcome. This result is statistically significant
for the STD condition and screening combined, substance abuse, and teen pregnancy.
On the other hand, individuals in families with a higher number of children are more
likely to experience one of the negative health outcomes. The magnitude of the effect varies
from 0.6 to 3.3 percentage points, being the highest for teenage pregnancy. It is likely due
to the fact that there is relatively less parental oversight in larger families. Finally, family
income is negatively correlated with the incidence of risky behavioral outcomes. As we would
expect, the better off the family is in terms of income, the less likely their child will experience
a negative health outcome, however the magnitude of the effect is very low. A $100 increase
in the net monthly income would produce a 0.02, 0.08, 0.28, and 0.23 percentage point
decrease in the probability of STD, STD screening, substance abuse, and teen pregnancy
respectively. Note that most families on Medicaid are relatively poor and there is not enough
income variation in this population group to evaluate the effect of income on the incidence
of negative health outcomes.
Table 16 in the Appendix shows that the results are robust when we control for co-
morbid psychiatric conditions that the individual is diagnosed with prior to their ADHD
diagnosis. When we exclude individuals who have been diagnosed with a comorbid psychi-
atric condition prior to their ADHD diagnosis, our results hold for the outcomes STD, STD
testing, and substance abuse, however, the estimate on treatment is statistically significant
for teenage pregnancy.
We also explore how our results vary across ADHD-diagnosed patients of different
gender, race, and birth cohort. The results are reported in Table 7. These stratifications
provides us with interesting insights. The results for male and female subpopulations sug-

 gest that treatment reduces the probability of STD contraction and STD testing for both
males and females but estimates are statistically significant only for females. As previously
discussed, females have a higher prevalence of STDs likely due to the fact that they are
screened for STDs more often than males. Treatment also reduces the probability of abusing
substances for both males and females but the effect is only statistically significant for males.
We find little heterogeneity across races. Treatment reduces the probability of STD
contraction and STD testing for both whites and minorities; however the effect of treatment
on STD contraction and STD testing are not statistically significant for whites. Treatment
reduces the probability of abusing substances for both whites and minorities but has a rela-
tively larger effect for whites. Finally, treatment is associated with a statistically insignificant
reduction in the probability of teenage pregnancy for whites and no effect for minorities.
Most interestingly, the effect of treatment differs across birth cohorts. Following earlier
research, we split patients by the year of birth into two groups: “older” and “younger”
cohorts. Our results are consistent with Dalsgaard et al. (2014), who find treatment to be
less effective in younger cohorts. This result is interpreted in light of increased incidence of
ADHD diagnosis, suggesting that average ADHD case is less severe in more recent cohorts
than in older cohorts.
6.2
Yearly Effects of ADHD Treatment
Perhaps an even more policy-relevant question is what is the per year difference in
outcomes for children who are treated with ADHD medication versus children who are not.
The average cost of a prescription medication is $347 per patient per year and the average
cost of ADHD-related physician visits is $562 per patient per year during the sample period
(measured in 2013 dollars). It is valuable to compare these treatment expenditures to what
Medicaid pays for treatment of realized negative health outcomes.30
The results suggest that pharmaceutical treatment is associated with a 1.2 percentage
point decrease in the probability of first contracting an STD, a 2.1 percentage point decrease
in the probability of first being screened for an STD, a 2.0 percentage point decrease in the
probability of first abusing substances, and a 3.1 percentage point decrease in the probability
of being injured, or a reduction of 0.109 injuries in a given year. Our findings for injuries
are in line with the findings of Dalsgaard et al. (2014).
The panel analysis results reported in Table 8 are consistent with our cross-section
analysis: we find that treatment is associated with a reduction in the probability of con-
tracting an STD, being screened for an STD, and abusing substances. The magnitudes of
30It is one of the goals of our future work to differentiate these effects by the year of diagnosis, adherence
status, and length of treatment.

Notes: The main coefficient estimates (in bold) in this table can be interpreted as the effect of treatment on the probability of a negative health outcome
during an individual’s adolescence. All specifications include individual county of residence and birth year fixed effects. We also control for the individual’s age
and net family income at first ADHD diagnosis, length of Medicaid eligibility, disability and foster care status. First stage coefficients show the relationship
between treatment receipt and physician propensity to prescribe medication. All specifications are estimated on a subsample of relevant birth cohorts of SC
Medicaid enrollees and include individuals born between 1987 and 1996. For robustness, we exclude potentially endogenous variables: family income and
duration of enrollment in Medicaid. The results stand nearly unchanged (results are available upon request). Coefficient estimates that are significant at 1%,
5%, and 10% level are denoted with a, b, and c respectively. Standard errors are in parentheses. They are clustered by individual’s provider who diagnosed
them with ADHD.

 the coefficients in the yearly effects regressions are complementary rather than directly com-
parable to the lifetime effects of ADHD treatment. In the former we specifically focus on
the periods of the child’s continuous enrollment in Medicaid, controlling for the patient’s age
and other time-varying parameters.
The coefficients on covariates of interest also support the findings on the lifetime effects.
For the probability of injuries, the signs are as expected. Boys are more likely to get injured
and the severity of the injuries is larger. They are 2.8 percentage points more likely to have
an injury in a given year than girls. Whites are consistently more likely to suffer from any
negative health outcome, including injuries, than blacks and Hispanics. We posit that this
is related to the likelihood of using medical services in general.
6.3
Effects of ADHD Treatment on Medicaid Spending
All the results described above were based on the negative health outcomes and the
event of an ADHD diagnosis that were identified using ICD-9 diagnosis codes and CPT
procedure codes. Only occasionally the codes of this system are indicative of the severity
of the condition or event. It is likely that ADHD medication has an effect not only on the
incidence of the negative health outcomes but also on their severity. A way to address this
question is to look at the direct cost to Medicaid of the outcomes that we observe in the
data (with an exception of pregnancy). We posit that the more visits are needed and the
more expensive they are to treat, the more severe is the patient’s condition. We focus on the
periods of continuous enrollment (as described in detail earlier). If a patient experienced an
adverse event, we use Medicaid payments to the providers to calculate the cost of this event.
The cost is zero if a patient did not experienced a negative health outcome.31
Panel A of Table 9 shows the results for the average annual cost to Medicaid over the
patients’ lifetime enrollment period for STD, STD testing, substance abuse, and injuries. In
per year terms (Panel B), we control for patient age and other time-varying characteristics.
If a patient is treated for ADHD, every patient per year would cost Medicaid $11.74 ($23.45)
less in STD-related expenses (if we include STD tests); $106.45 less in substance abuse-
related costs, and $122.16 fewer in injury spending. To give an indication of the relative size
of these estimated effects, treatment reduces spending on substance abuse disorders by 0.069
standard deviation and injury spending by 0.074 standard deviation.
Note that both lifetime and per year effects of treatment on the incidence of STD
and STD that includes testing are large and negative, but the effects on costs related to
these events are rather modest. This is likely due to the difficulty of measuring STD-related
31Medicaid payments are CPI-adjusted to 2013 dollars.

Notes: The main coefficient estimates (in bold) in this table can be interpreted as the average annual effect of treatment on the probability of a post-diagnosis negative health outcome.
All specifications include individual’s county of residence fixed effects, year fixed effects, and their interactions. We also control for the individual’s disability and foster care status. The
coefficients on the number of children and adults are scaled up by 10 in the STD and STD screening regressions in order to report their magnitudes. First stage coefficient shows the
relationship between treatment receipt and physician propensity to prescribe medication. All specifications except for injuries are estimated on a subsample of relevant birth cohorts of
SC Medicaid enrollees and include individuals born between 1987 and 1996. Coefficient estimates that are significant at 1%, 5%, and 10% level are denoted with a, b, and c respectively.

 costs. Our STD cost measure only includes expenses related to provider visit. The most
common procedures performed are one-time test and the patient is also charged for the office
visit itself. By construction, STD spending will have no-charge periods with intermittent
chargers for STD test and office visit in the absence of pharmacological treatment spending
information. Thus, our STD spending measure is understating the effect.
For one of our outcomes, substance abuse, we were able to use earlier literature to
construct a comprehensive cost measure that includes medical doctor visits and the cost of
pharmacological treatment. We are not aware of methodological work that would help us
construct the same measure for STDs. The results on the incidence and cost of substance
abuse are better aligned than the results for STD.
OLS estimates that we present for comparison purposes, have the same sign as the IV
estimates and are mostly noisy.
7
Robustness
We perform several robustness checks. First, we test the sensitivity of the results to
alternative definitions of pharmacological treatment. Our baseline findings have the same
signs on the coefficients of interest and differ from the alternative specifications’ results in
an expected way. Second, we introduce two alternative instrumental variables: the first-in-
data provider propensity to prescribe and a geographic instrument based on child’s school
location.
The alternative IVs would be expected to have weaker explanatory power but
are arguably more exogenous. Both tell a story compatible with our preferred instrument.
The summary of the results is shown in Table 10. Each row represents the three different
treatment definitions and reports both the first stage coefficient and the coefficient on treat-
ment instrumented with an alternative instrumental variable and our preferred instrument
for comparison purposes.
7.1
Alternative definition of treatment
Pharmacological treatment can be defined in a number of ways. Our baseline definition
considers an individual as treated if they have a record of taking any medication approved
for ADHD after being diagnosed with ADHD. The estimates are reported in the top section
of Table 10.
Alternatively, we could assign the treated status to individuals, who take a prescription
within a year from their initial diagnosis. This definition captures the differences between
treated and non-treated in the first years after the diagnosis better and thus, is expected to

Notes: The main coefficient estimates (in bold) in Panel A can be interpreted as the effect of treatment on the average cost of ADHD-related post-diagnosis
negative health outcomes to Medicaid per year of uninterrupted individual’s enrollment. In Panel B, we control for time-varying characteristics and the
coefficients can be interpreted as the effect of ADHD treatment on the average annual cost of negative health outcomes to Medicaid. All specifications in
Panel B include individual county of residence fixed effects, year fixed effects, and their interactions. Medicaid spending is adjusted to 2013 dollars. First
stage coefficients show the relationship between treatment receipt and physician propensity to prescribe medication. All specifications except for injuries
are estimated on a subsample of relevant birth cohorts of SC Medicaid enrollees and include individuals born between 1987 and 1996 who were eligible
for Medicaid at age of 11 years old or later. Coefficient estimates that are significant at 1%, 5%, and 10% level are denoted with a, b, and c respectively.
Standard errors are in parentheses. They are clustered by individual’s provider who diagnosed them with ADHD.
33
 perform well in a setting where we are looking at the incidence of negative health outcomes
immediately after the initial ADHD diagnosis. The relationship between the provider propen-
sity to prescribe medication and treatment under this definition is stronger, as expected. By
construction, a given provider prescribes medication within a year of the diagnosis. We im-
pose this restriction in response to the data limitation as described in Section 4 in detail. The
estimation yields relatively smaller point estimates for treatment in absolute value compared
to our preferred specification. This result might be explained by the fact that 7% patients
receive treatment after 365 days of being diagnosed and have beneficial outcomes but are
being coded as never treated in this specification.
For the second test, we follow earlier literature (see Dalsgaard et al. (2014)) and define
treatment as being treated for at least 6 months in a given year. This definition captures the
idea of treatment adherence. Perhaps one prescription would not cure or even alleviate the
condition, but half a year of treatment is more likely to have an impact on the child’s health
and behavioral outcomes. Again, by construction, the instrument based on patient adherence
predicts a take up of any treatment weaker than the baseline. Perhaps not surprising, when
we define the treated population as only those who adhere to treatment for six months, we
find treatment to be more effective.
We present these results for comparison purposes and we argue that our baseline
IV is more exogenous. The provider might influence adherence to treatment and health
outcomes through channels other than prescribing medication. Moreover, the data show
that it is common for a child to temporarily suspend treatment over school holidays and
restart treatment later in the year. The IV based on six months of continuous treatment
may not include these individuals. In other words, our IV can be interpreted as a lower
bound estimate of the effects of treatment on negative health outcomes.
7.2
Alternative instrumental variables
We construct two alternative instrumental variables and test them on all treatment def-
initions described above. First, instead of the diagnosing provider propensity to prescribe we
look at the first-in-data provider prescribing preferences regarding the ADHD medications.
The purpose behind this IV is to address potential concerns about the provider selection
based on the probability they would prescribe medication.
We argue that children visit
their pediatrician or family provider for most health issues, including ADHD, rather than
selecting a specific provider to go to with ADHD-related concerns. We look at all child’s
medical records and select the individual’s first-in-data provider. We calculate a measure
of prescribing preferences for this provider based on all patients with ADHD the provider
34
 diagnosed in that year. Note that not all providers have patients with ADHD every year
and there is also a significant provider mobility in and out of Medicaid. For this reason, we
do not have a first-in-data provider propensity to prescribe for everyone who was diagnosed
with ADHD in our sample.
In line with our main specification findings, the results utilizing this alternative in-
strument suggest that treatment reduces the probability of STD contraction, STD screening,
and substance abuse disorders (see Table 10). The reduction in sample size likely explains
the increase in the noisiness of our coefficient estimates. These results provide additional
support to the evidence we presented earlier (Section 5) on the absence of provider selection.
Next, we define an alternative geographic area instrument based on the school patients
attend. We construct this instrument by taking the fraction of other students treated with
medication divided by the total number of students diagnosed with ADHD in the individual’s
year of diagnosis at the individual’s school.
The results suggest that treatment reduces
the probability of STD contraction, STD screening, and abusing substances, however the
estimates are noisy likely due to the relatively weaker first stage. The first stage estimates
are statistically weak for treatment defined as treated for at least 6 months in a given year
and for this reason are not reported.

Conclusion
This paper investigates the effectiveness of ADHD medication in reducing the probabil-
ity of short-term and long-term negative health outcomes associated with the disorder. Over
the past decade, SC Medicaid spending on prescription drugs increased nearly three-fold to
$69 million in 2013. It is important to understand whether the increased expenditures on
treatment produced any benefit in terms of improved health (fewer and less severe injuries),
reduction in risky behaviors that potentially lead to teen pregnancies, STDs, and substance
use and abuse. The focus population of our study are children from relatively disadvantaged
families who are enrolled in SC Medicaid and who are diagnosed with ADHD. This popu-
lation is particularly vulnerable: up to a quarter of Medicaid enrollees are diagnosed with
ADHD in their birth cohort. Although we are unable to make a statement on the effec-
tiveness of ADHD treatment in general population, our sample represents a large fraction
of the state population, and even a higher fraction of diagnosed children. Since children on
Medicaid are disproportionately diagnosed with ADHD and their incentives are distorted in
the absence of a drug price tag, this population should be of primary focus.
Our panel data set includes all South Carolina Medicaid claims between 2003 and
2013. To overcome potential endogeneity of treatment takeup, we use variation in physician

 prescribing preferences for ADHD. Our findings suggest that ADHD medication is effective
in reducing the probability of the negative health and behavioral outcomes that we are able
to identify in administrative data. Based on our preferred specification, over the course of
teenage years the probability of contracting an STD decreases by 3.6 percentage points; and
individual is 7.7 percentage points less likely to be screened for an STD, and 12.5 percentage
points less likely to receive medical attention related to a substance abuse disorder if treated
with ADHD medication. The point estimate on the probability of teenage pregnancy is also
negative (-3.7 percentage points) but not statistically significant.
In per year terms and controlling for time-varying characteristics, these findings trans-
late into a 1.2 percentage point decrease in the probability of contracting an STD, a 2.1
percentage point decrease in the probability of being screened for an STD, a 2.0 percentage
point decrease in the probability of abusing substances, and a 3.1 percentage point decrease
in the probability of being injured, or 0.109 reduction in the number of injury-related medical
procedures in a given year.
These results generally agree with the findings of Dalsgaard et al. (2014), who find
that medication is effective in reducing the number of hospital contacts and the likelihood
of criminal activity. However, Currie et al. (2014) find that an increase in medication use
is associated with negative effects on children’s educational outcomes, deterioration in rela-
tionships with parents, and increase in the probability of depression. These differences are
suggestive of ADHD medication having varying effects on noncognitive outcomes in compar-
ison to cognitive abilities.
It is plausible to suggest that ADHD medication has an effect not only on the incidence
of negative health outcomes but also on their severity. We go beyond the existing literature
and address this question by looking at the direct cost to Medicaid of all outcomes that we
observe in the data (except for pregnancy). We posit that the more visits are needed and the
more costly they are, the more severe is the patient’s condition. For every patient treated
for ADHD, each year of eligibility would cost Medicaid an estimated $11.74 ($23.45) less
in STD-related expenses (if we include STD tests); $106.45 less in substance abuse-related
costs and $122.16 in injury spending. In per year terms, when we control for patient age
and other time-varying characteristics, the results tell the same story and are very similar
in magnitude.
The limitations of this study that we hope to address in future research include the
scope of the effects of interest and external validity. First, our results reflect the effect of
treatment of a marginal patient and do not attempt to measure the benefit of pharmaceutical
treatment for children with ADHD that will inevitably be treated. Second, although our
sample of Medicaid children makes up a large proportion of the population diagnosed with
37
 ADHD, the results are not necessarily generalizable to the non-Medicaid population. At the
same time, the population in our study is the most affected by the negative health outcomes
that children with ADHD are prone to, which makes our findings even more policy-relevant.
On average, SC Medicaid spent $347 for prescription medication and $562 on ADHD-
related physician visits, including behavioral therapy, while the total savings across all neg-
ative health outcomes summed up to $379 on average per teenage per year. However, these
“savings” do not include the costs associated with a teenage pregnancy, any indirect benefits
that stem from preventing negative health and behavioral outcomes, or any indirect benefits
of the individual’s peers. We are also not able to estimate costs in terms side effects of
the medication. With the increasing rates of ADHD diagnosis and respective government
spending on programs like Medicaid as well as Medicaid expansion, comparison of treatment
costs and benefits deserve special investigation in future work.

Notes: The sample includes a random group of SC Medicaid enrollees, who were eligible for Medicaid for at least one year at
any age between 3 and 18 years old in 2003-2013 and who did not have an ADHD-related medical history during this time period.
Family characteristics are reported on average per patient/eligibility year. Foster care and disability rates are calculated based on
the Medicaid enrollment categories. Mother characteristics are reported based on in-state birth certificate information matched
to Medicaid records. They are available only for a subsample of the 73,923 patients. Mother’s age and educational attainment
are recorded at the time of the child’s birth. “HS” stands for high school education level.

Notes: The main coefficient estimates (in bold) in this table can be interpreted as the effect of treatment on the probability of a negative health oucome during an
individual’s adolescence. All specifications include individual’s county of residence and birth year fixed effects. We also control for the individual’s age of the first
ADHD diagnosis, Medicaid eligibility timing and length, disability and foster care status, mother’s educational attainment, and age when she gave birth. First stage
coefficients show the relationship between treatment receipt and physician propensity to prescribe medication. All specifications are estimated on a subsample of
relevant birth cohorts of SC Medicaid enrollees and include individuals born between 1987 and 1996. Coefficient estimates that are significant at 1%, 5%, and 10%
level are denoted with a, b, and c respectively. Standard errors are in parentheses. They are clustered by individual’s provider who diagnosed them with ADHD.

Notes: The main coefficient estimates (in bold) in this table can be interpreted as the effect of treatment on the probability of a negative health outcome during an individual’s
adolescence. All specifications include individual county of residence and birth year fixed effects. We also control for the individual’s age and net family income at first ADHD
diagnosis, length of Medicaid eligibility, disability, comorbid conditions, and foster care status. First stage coefficients show the relationship between treatment receipt and physician
propensity to prescribe medication. All specifications are estimated on a subsample of relevant birth cohorts of SC Medicaid enrollees and include individuals born between 1987
and 1996. Coefficient estimates that are significant at 1%, 5%, and 10% level are denoted with a, b, and c respectively. Standard errors are in parentheses. They are clustered by
