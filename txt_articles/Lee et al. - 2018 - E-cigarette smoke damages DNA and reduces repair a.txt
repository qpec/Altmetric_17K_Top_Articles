E-cigarette smoke delivers stimulant nicotine as aerosol without
tobacco or the burning process. It contains neither carcinogenic
incomplete combustion byproducts nor tobacco nitrosamines, the
nicotine nitrosation products. E-cigarettes are promoted as safe
and have gained significant popularity. In this study, instead of
detecting nitrosamines, we directly measured DNA damage in-
duced by nitrosamines in different organs of E-cigarette smoke-
exposed mice. We found mutagenic O6-methyldeoxyguanosines
and γ-hydroxy-1,N2-propano-deoxyguanosines in the lung, blad-
der, and heart. DNA-repair activity and repair proteins XPC and
OGG1/2 are significantly reduced in the lung. We found that nic-
otine and its metabolite, nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone, can
induce the same effects and enhance mutational susceptibility and
tumorigenic transformation of cultured human bronchial epithelial
and urothelial cells. These results indicate that nicotine nitrosation
occurs in vivo in mice and that E-cigarette smoke is carcinogenic to
the murine lung and bladder and harmful to the murine heart. It is
therefore possible that E-cigarette smoke may contribute to lung
and bladder cancer, as well as heart disease, in humans.
E-cigarettes | DNA damage | DNA repair | lung–bladder–heart | cancer
E
-cigarettes (E-cigs) are designed to deliver the stimulant
nicotine, similar to conventional cigarettes, through an
aerosol state. In E-cigs, nicotine is dissolved in relatively harm-
less organic solvents, such as glycerol and propylene glycol, then
aerosolized with the solvents by controlled electric heating.
Hence, E-cig smoke (ECS) contains mostly nicotine and the gas
phase of the solvents (1–4). In contrast, conventional tobacco
smoke (TS), in addition to nicotine and its nitrosamine deriva-
tives,
contains
numerous
(>7,000)
incomplete
combustion
byproducts, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
aromatic amines, aldehydes, and benzene, many of which are
human carcinogens, irritants, and allergens (5, 6). TS also has a
strong scent. Therefore, TS is both harmful and carcinogenic to
smokers, as well as being unpleasant and harmful to bystanders
(7). Because of these effects, TS has become an unwelcome
social habit and is no longer acceptable in many social settings
and public domains (8). E-cigs have been promoted as an al-
ternative to cigarettes that can deliver a TS “high” without TS’s
ill and unpleasant effects. Since it appears that ECS contains
neither carcinogens, allergens, nor odors that result from in-
complete combustion, as a result of these claims, E-cigs have
become increasingly popular, particularly with young people (9).
However, the question as to whether ECS is as harmful as TS,
particularly with regard to carcinogenicity, remains a serious
public health issue that deserves careful examination.
It is well established that most chemical carcinogens, either
directly or via metabolic activation, can induce damage in ge-
nomic DNA, that unrepaired DNA damage can induce muta-
tions, and that multiple mutations can lead to cancer (10). Many
chemical carcinogens can also impair DNA-repair activity
(11–13). Therefore, in this study, as a step to understanding the
carcinogenicity of ECS, we determined whether ECS can induce
DNA damage in different organs of a mouse model and whether
ECS can affect DNA-repair activity. We then characterized the
chemical nature of ECS-induced DNA damage and how ECS
affects DNA repair. Last, we determined the effect of ECS
metabolites on the susceptibility to mutations and tumorigenic
transformation of cultured human cells.
Results
ECS Induces O6-Methyl-Deoxuguanosine in the Lung, Bladder, and
Heart. Nicotine is the major component of ECS (3). The major-
ity (80%) of inhaled nicotine in smoke is quickly metabolized
into cotinine, which is excreted into the bloodstream and sub-
sequently into urine (14). Cotinine is generally believed to be
nontoxic and noncarcinogenic (15); however, a small portion
(<10%) of inhaled nicotine is believed to be metabolized into
nitrosamines in vivo (16–18). Nitrosamines induce tumors in
different organs in animal models (6, 19). Inhaled nitrosamines
are metabolized into N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and nicotine-
derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK). It has been proposed that
NNK can be further metabolized and spontaneously degraded
Significance
E-cigarette smoke (ECS) delivers nicotine through aerosols
without burning tobacco. ECS is promoted as noncarcinogenic.
We found that ECS induces DNA damage in mouse lung, bladder,
and heart and reduces DNA-repair functions and proteins in lung.
Nicotine and its nitrosation product 4-(methylnitrosamine)-1-(3-
pyridyl)-1-butanone can cause the same effects as ECS and en-
hance mutations and tumorigenic cell transformation in cultured
human lung and bladder cells. These results indicate that nicotine
nitrosation occurs in the lung, bladder, and heart, and that its
products are further metabolized into DNA damaging agents.
We propose that ECS, through damaging DNA and inhibiting
DNA repair, might contribute to human lung and bladder cancer
as well as to heart disease, although further studies are required
to substantiate this proposal.

 into methyldiazohydroxide (MDOH), pyridyl-butyl derivatives
(PBDs), and formaldehyde, and that NNN degrade into hydroxyl
or keto PBDs (20). While nicotine cannot bind to DNA directly,
MDOH can methylate deoxyguanosines and thymidines in DNA
(21). Although the fate of nitrosamine-induced formaldehyde
and PBDs in vivo is less clear, both are capable of inducing DNA
damage in vitro (22–25). Therefore, if ECS in fact is a carcino-
gen, it is likely that its carcinogenicity is derived from nitrosa-
mines that are derived from the nitrosation of nicotine (5, 19,
21). Nitrosamines are potent carcinogens and it is generally
believed that their carcinogenicity is via induction of methyl-
ation DNA damage (26, 27). As a step in examining the carci-
nogenicity of ECS, we determined whether ECS can induce
O6-methyl-deoxuguanosine (O6-medG) adducts in lung, heart,
liver, and bladder tissues of mice. Mice were exposed to ECS
(10 mg/mL, 3 h/d, 5 d/wk) for 12 wk; the dose and duration
equivalent in human terms to light E-cig smoking for 10 y. The
results in Fig. 1 A and B, Fig. S1, and Table S1 show that ECS
induced significant amounts of O6-medG adducts in the lung,
bladder, and heart and that the level of O6-medG adducts in lung
was three- to eightfold higher than in the bladder and heart. These
results are consistent with the explanation that nicotine is me-
tabolized into MDOH, which can methylate DNA (16, 20).
ECS Induces γ-OH-PdG in the Lung, Bladder, and Heart. Recently, we
found that aldehyde-derived cyclic 1,N2-propano-dG (PdG), in-
cluding γ-OH-1,N2-PdG (γ-OH-PdG) and α-methyl-γ-OH-1,N2
-PdG adducts, are the major DNA adducts in mouse models (28)
induced by TS, which contains abundant nitrosamines and al-
dehydes (20). We therefore determined the extent of PdG
formation in different organs of ECS-exposed mice using a
PdG-specific antibody (28–30).
The results in Fig. 1 C and D show that ECS induced PdG
adducts in the lung, bladder, and heart, and that the level of PdG
in the lung is two- to threefold higher than in the bladder and
heart. Moreover, the level of PdG is 25- to 60-fold higher than
the level of O6-medG in lung, bladder, and heart tissues, in-
dicating that induction of PdG is more efficient than induction of
O6-medG by nicotine metabolic products and/or that O6-medG
is more efficiently repaired in these organs. ECS, however, did
not induce either O6-medG or PdG in liver DNA.
Due to the relatively minute amount of genomic DNA that is
possible to isolate from mouse organs, in this case, specifi-
cally from bladder mucosa, which is only able to yield up to 2 μg
of genomic DNA from each mouse, we used the sensitive 32P-
postlabeling thin layer chromatography (TLC)/HPLC method to
identify the species of the PdG formed in lung and bladder tis-
sues (13, 28, 31). The results in Fig. 1E show that the majority of
PdG (>95%) formed in these tissues coelute with γ-OH-PdG
adduct standards with a minor portion that coelute with α-OH-
PdG standards.
Relationship of ECS-Induced PdG and O6-medG Formation in Different
Organs of Each Animal. We then determined the relationship of
PdG and O6-medG formation in different organs of each animal.
The results in Fig. 2A show that the levels of PdG and O6-medG
in the same organs are positively related to each other. Thus,
a lung tissue sample that had a high level of PdG also had a
high level of O6-medG. The same relationship between PdG
and O6-medG formation was found in the bladder and heart
(Fig. 2A and Table S1). The results in Fig. 2B show that in the
same mouse, the levels of PdG and O6-medG formation in dif-
ferent organs also have a positive correlation: Mice with a high
level of PdG and O6-medG formation in the lung also had a high
level of these DNA adducts in the bladder and heart (Fig. 2B and
Table S1). Together, these results indicate that the formation of
PdG and O6-medG DNA adducts in the lung, bladder, and heart
tissue are the result of DNA damaging agents derived from ECS
exposure, and raising the possibility that the ability for nicotine
absorption and metabolism and DNA-repair activity of different
organs determine their susceptibility to ECS-induced DNA
adduct formation.
ECS Reduces DNA-Repair Activity in the Lung. Recently, we have
found that lung tissues of mice exposed to TS have lower DNA-
repair activity and lower levels of DNA-repair proteins XPC and
OGG1/2 and that aldehydes, such as acrolein, acetaldehyde,
crotonaldehyde, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, can modify DNA-
repair proteins, causing the degradation of these repair proteins
and impairing DNA-repair function (11, 12, 28). These findings
raise the possibility that, via induction of aldehydes, ECS can
impair DNA-repair functions. To test this possibility, we de-
termined the effect of ECS on the activity of the two major
DNA-repair mechanisms in mouse lung tissues: nucleotide ex-
cision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) (32). We
adopted a well-established in vitro DNA damage-dependent
repair synthesis assay, which requires only 10 μg of freshly pre-
pared cell lysates (11, 13, 28). Since the amount of bladder
mucosa collected from individual mice was minute, we were only
able to determine DNA-repair activity in lung tissues (28). We
used UV-irradiated DNA, which contains cyclobutane pyrimi-
dine dimers as well as <6-4> photoproducts; Acr-modified
DNA, which contains γ-OH-PdG; and H2O2-modified DNA,
which contains 8-oxo-dG, as substrates (13, 28). It is well
established that NER is the major mechanism that repairs
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers,
<6-4> photoproducts, and
γ-OH-PdG, and that BER is the major mechanism that repairs 8-
oxo-dG (32, 33). Therefore, these two types of substrates allow
us to determine the NER and BER activity in the cell lysates (11,
13). The results in Fig. 3 A and B and Fig. S2 show that both
NER and BER activity in lung tissue of ECS-exposed mice are
significantly lower than in lung tissue of filtered air (FA)-
exposed mice.
ECS Causes a Reduction of Repair Protein XPC and OGG1/2. We then
determined the level of XPC and OGG1/2, the two crucial
proteins, respectively, for NER and BER (34, 35). The results in
Fig. 3C show that the level of XPC and OGG1/2 in lung tissues
of ECS-exposed mice was significantly lower than in control
mice. We further determined the relationship between DNA
adduct formation and DNA-repair activity in lung tissues of
FA- and ECS-exposed mice. Since NER is the major repair mech-
anism for bulky DNA damage such as γ-OH-PdG and photo-
dimers (11, 33) and BER is a major repair mechanism for
base damage (32), we compared BER activity with the level of
O6-medG adducts and NER activity with the level of γ-OH-PdG
adducts. The results in Fig. 3D show that NER and BER activity
in lung tissue of different mice is inversely related to the level of
γ-OH-PdG and O6-medG adducts, respectively. These results
indicate that in lung tissue, NER and BER activities are crucial
factors in determining the level of ECS-induced γ-OH-PdG and
O6-medG DNA damage; mice that are more sensitive to ECS-
induced DNA-repair inhibition accumulate more ECS-induced
DNA damage in their lung and, perhaps, bladder and heart.
It should be noted that in human cells, repair of O6-medG ad-
ducts is mainly carried out by O6-methylguanine DNA methyl-
transferase (MGMT) (36, 37). The positive relationship between
BER activity and the O6-medG level in lung tissues of mice
implies that ECS impairs BER enzymes as well as MGMT, and/
or O6-medG is repaired by a BER mechanism in mice.
Nicotine Induces DNA Damage in Human Cells. Many tobacco-
specific nitrosamines that result from the nitrosation of nico-
tine, such as NNN and NNK, are potent carcinogens and can
induce cancer in different organs, including the lung (20, 21, 27).
While NNK and NNN cannot covalently bind with DNA directly,

 it has been proposed that one of NNK’s metabolic products,
MDOH, can interact with DNA to induce mutagenic O6-medG
adducts (20, 21, 27). These results raise the possibility that ECS-
induced O6-medG is due to the nitrosation of nicotine, and that
NNK resulting from nicotine nitrosation then further transforms
into MDOH in lung and bladder tissue (20). To test this possi-
bility, we determined the DNA adducts induced by nicotine and
NNK in cultured human bronchial epithelial and urothelial cells,
and the effect of nicotine and NNK treatments on DNA repair,
using the same methods indicated in Fig. 1. The results in Fig. 4
show that both nicotine and NNK can induce the same type of
γ-OH-PdG adducts, and O6-medG adducts. Since it is well
established that many aldehydes can induce cyclic PdG in cells
(38–40), these results suggest that aldehydes as well as MDOH
are NNK metabolites, which induce γ-OH-PdG and O6-medG.
Nicotine Reduces DNA Repair in Human Cells. We next determined
the effects of nicotine and NNK treatment on DNA-repair ac-
tivity and repair protein levels in human lung and bladder epi-
thelial cells using the method described in Fig. 3. The results in
Fig. 5 show that nicotine and NNK treatments not only inhibit
NER and BER activities, they also reduce the protein levels of
XPC and hOGG1/2. We found that these reductions of XPC and
hOGG1/2 induced by nicotine and NNK can be prevented or
attenuated by the proteasome and autophagosome inhibitors
MG132, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and lactacystin (Fig. S3) (13,
41–43). These results indicate that metabolites of nicotine and
NNK can modify DNA-repair proteins and cause proteosomal
and autophagosomal degradation of these proteins and that
ECS’s effect on the inhibition of DNA-repair activity is via
modifications and degradation of DNA-repair proteins by
its metabolites.
Together, these results indicate that human bronchial epi-
thelial and urothelial cells as well as lung, heart, and bladder
tissues in the mouse are able to nitrosate nicotine and metabolize
nitrosated nicotine into NNK and then MDOH and aldehydes.
Furthermore, whereas MDOH induces O6-medG adducts, al-
dehydes not only can induce γ-OH-PdG, they also can inhibit
DNA repair and cause repair protein degradation.
Nicotine Enhances Mutations and Cell Transformation. The afore-
mentioned results demonstrate that ECS’s major component
nicotine, via its metabolites, MDOH, and aldehydes, not only
can induce mutagenic DNA adducts, but that they also can
inhibit DNA repair in human lung and bladder epithelial cells.
These results raise the possibility that ECS and its metabolites
can function not only as mutagens but also as comutagens to
enhance DNA damage-induced mutagenesis. To test this pos-
sibility, we determined the effect of these agents on cell mu-
tation susceptibility on UV- and H2O2-induced DNA damage
Fig. 2.

respectively, in the lung of mice exposed to ECS and FA. Each symbol represents each individual mouse.

 using the well-established supF mutation system (13). The re-
sults in Fig. 6A show that nicotine and NNK treatment in both
human lung and bladder epithelial cells enhances the sponta-
neous mutation frequency as well as UV- and H2O2-induced
mutation frequency by two- to fourfold. These results indicate
that nicotine and NNK treatment sensitize these human cells to
the extent that they are more susceptible to mutagenesis. We
further tested the effect of these agents on induction of tu-
morigenic transformation using the anchorage-independent
soft-agar growth assay (44, 45). The results in Fig. 6 B and C
show that nicotine and NNK greatly induce soft-agar anchorage-
independent growth of human lung and bladder cells, a necessary
ability for tumorigenic cells (46–49).
Discussion
The major purpose of E-cig smoking as well as tobacco smoking
is to deliver the stimulant nicotine via aerosols, which allow
smokers to obtain instant gratification. Unlike TS, which con-
tains nitrosamines and numerous carcinogenic chemicals resul-
ted from burning, ECS contains nicotine and relatively harmless
organic solvents. Therefore, E-cig has been promoted as non-
carcinogenic and a safer substitute for tobacco. In fact, recent
studies show that E-cig smokers, similar to individuals on nico-
tine replacement therapy, have 97% less 4-(methylnitrosamino)-
1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), an isoform form of NNK, a
tobacco nitrosamine and lung carcinogen, in their body fluid

 than tobacco smokers (50). Based on these results, ECS has been
recommended as a substitute for TS (50). However, E-cig
smoking is gaining popularity rapidly particularly in young indi-
viduals and it is important to note that many of these E-cig
smokers have taken up E-cig smoking habit are not necessary
doing it for the purpose of quitting TS, rather, it is because they
are assuming that E-cig smoking is safe. Currently, there are
18 million E-cig smokers in the United States and 16% of high
school students smoke E-cig (51, 52). Understanding the carci-
nogenicity of ECS is an urgent public health issue. Since it takes
decades for carcinogen exposure to induce cancer in humans, for
decades to come there will be no meaningful epidemiological
study to address the carcinogenicity of ECS. Therefore, animal
models and cell culture models are the reasonable alternatives to
address this question.
Nicotine has not been shown to be carcinogenic in animal
models (7). However, during tobacco curing, substantial amounts
of nicotine are transformed into tobacco-specific nitrosamines
(TSA) via nitrosation, and many of these TSA, such as NNK
and NNN, are carcinogenic in animal models (19, 53–55).
Because of these findings, the occurrence and the level of ni-
trosamines in blood fluid have been used as the gold stan-
dard for determination of the potential carcinogenicity of
smoking (56). While the NNAL level in E-cig smokers is 97%
lower than in tobacco smokers, nonetheless, it is significant
higher than in nonsmokers (50). This finding indicates that
nitrosation of nicotine occurs in the human body and that
ECS is potentially carcinogenic.
It is well established that cytochrome p450 enzymes in human
and animal cells can metabolize and transform NNK, NNAL,
and NNN into different products, which can modify DNA as well
as proteins (20, 57, 58). This finding raises the possibility that the
level of these nitrosamines detected in the blood stream of E-cig
smokers at any given time may grossly underestimate the level of
nicotine nitrosation. We undertake the approach of detecting
DNA damage induced by nicotine rather than detecting nitro-
samine level to address the potential mutagenic and carcinogenic
effect of ECS. It should be noted that in vivo DNA damage can
remain in genomic DNA for many hours and even days (13, 59,
60). Therefore, this approach not only is direct but also more
sensitive in determining the carcinogenicity of ECS.
The level of γ-OH-PdG adducts induced by E-cig smoke in
mice and by nicotine and NNK in cultured human cells is 10-fold
higher than O6-medG (Fig. 1). We have shown that γ-OH-PdG
adducts are as mutagenic as BPDE-dG and UV photoproducts
and induce G to T and G to A mutations similar to the mutations
in the p53 gene in tobacco smoker lung cancer patients (11).
Together, these results suggest that γ-OH-PdG adducts are the
major cause of nitrosamine lung carcinogenicity.
The current understanding of NNK and NNN metabolism
indicates that NNK metabolites are further transformed into
PBDs, formaldehyde, and MDOH (20, 21, 61), while NNN
metabolites are hydroxyl and keto forms of PBD (20, 21, 61).
While MDOH can induce O6-medG adducts, it is unclear what
metabolites induce γ-OH-PdG adducts. It is well established
that acrolein–DNA interaction generates γ-OH-PdG adducts
(11, 13, 30) and that formaldehyde induces hydroxymethylated
Fig. 4.
Nicotine and NNK induce γ-OH-PdG and O6-medG in cultured human lung and bladder epithelial cells. Human lung epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells and
urothelial (UROtsa) cells were treated with different concentrations of nicotine and NNK as described in text. O6-medG and PdG formed in the genomic DNA
were determined as described in Fig. 1. (A) The DNA adducts were detected by immunochemical methods (13, 28). (B) The PdG adducts formed in the genomic
DNA were further identified as γ-OH-PdG adducts by the 32P postlabeling followed by 2D-TLC/HPLC method (13, 28).

 nucleotides, mainly dG, in animal models (62). It has been
found that in vitro formaldehyde combined with acetalde-
hyde can induce γ-OH-PdG (63). Therefore, it possible that
ECS, nicotine, and NNK induce γ-OH-PdG via their metabolite
formaldehyde, which triggers lipid peroxidation and produces
acrolein and acetaldehyde byproducts; consequently, these
byproducts induce γ-OH-PdG.
In summary, we found that ECS induces mutagenic γ-OH-
PdG and O6-medG adducts in lung, bladder, and heart tissues
of exposed mice. ECS also causes reduction of DNA-repair ac-
tivity and repair proteins XPC and OGG1/2 in lung tissue.
Furthermore, nicotine and NNK induce the same effects in hu-
man lung and bladder epithelial cells. We propose that nicotine
can be nitrosated, metabolized, and further transformed into
aldehydes and MDOH in lung, bladder, and heart tissues of
humans and mice. Whereas MDOH induced O6-medG, alde-
hydes not only induce γ-OH-PdG, but also inhibit DNA repair
and reduce XPC and OGG1 proteins (Fig. S3). We also found
that nicotine and NNK can enhance mutational susceptibility
and induced tumorigenic transformation of human lung and
bladder epithelial cells. Based on these results, we propose that
ECS is carcinogenic and that E-cig smokers have a higher risk

chemicals, acrolein, nicotine, and NNK were commercially available. Im-
mortalized human lung (BEAS-2B) and bladder epithelial (UROtsa) cells
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and J.R. Masters,
University College London, London. All animal procedures were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, New York University
School of Medicine.
ECS Generation and Mice Exposure. Twenty FVBN (Jackson Laboratory, Charles
River) male mice were randomized into two groups, 10 each. Mice were
exposed to ECS (10 mg/mL), 3 h/d, 5 d/wk, for 12 wk. ECS was generated by
an E-cig machine, as previously described (64). An automated three-port
E-cigarette aerosol generator (e∼Aerosols) was used to produce E-cigarette
aerosols from NJOY top fill tanks (NJOY, Inc.) filled with 1.6 mL of e-juice
with 10 mg/mL nicotine in a propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin mixture (50/
50 by volume; MtBakerVapor MESA). Each day the tanks were filled with fresh
e-juice from a stock mixture, and the voltage was adjusted to produce a
consistent wattage (∼1.96 A at 4.2 V) for each tank. The puff aerosols were
generated with charcoal and high-efficiency particulate filtered air using a
Fig. 6.
Nicotine and NNK treatments enhance mutational susceptibility and cell transformation. Human lung and bladder epithelial cells (BEAS-2B and
UROtsa) were treated with NNK (0.5 mM) and nicotine (25 mM for BEAS-2B cells, and 5 mM for UROtsa cells) for 1 h at 37 °C; these treatments render 50% cell
killing. (A) UVC-irradiated (1,500 J/m2) or H2O2 modified (100 mM, 1 h at 37 °C) plasmid DNAs containing the supF gene were transfected into these cells, and
the mutations in control, and nicotine- and NNK- treated cells were detected and quantified as previously described (13, 28). (B) Detection of anchorage-
independent soft-agar growth. A total of 5,000 treated cells were seeded in a soft-agar plate. The method for anchorage-independent soft-agar growth is the
same as previously described (28). Typical soft-agar growth plates stained with crystal violet were shown. (C) Quantifications of percent of control, nicotine,
and NNK-treated cells formed colonies in soft-agar plates.

 rotorless and brushless diaphragm pump and a puff regime consisting of 35-mL
puff volumes of 4-s duration at 30-s intervals. Each puff was mixed with filtered
air before entering the exposure chamber (1 m3). Tanks were refilled with fresh
e-juice at 1.5 h into the exposure period during the pause between puffs. Mass
concentrations of the exposure atmospheres were monitored in real time using
a DataRam4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and also determined gravimetrically by
collecting particles on Teflon filters (Teflo, 2 mm pore size; Pall) weighed before
and after sample collection using an electrobalance (MT-5; Metler).
Cell Cultures and Treatments of Nicotine and NNK. Exponentially growing BEAS-2B
and UROtsa were treated with different concentrations of nicotine (BEAS-2B: 0,
100, 200 μM; UROtsa: 0, 1, 2.5 μM), and NNK (BEAS-2B: 0, 100, 300, 1,000 μM;
UROtsa: 0, 50, 100, 200 μM) for determination of DNA adduct and DNA-repair
activity. For XPC and hOGG1/2 detection, BEAS-2B were treated with nicotine (0,
50, 100, 200 μM), and NNK (0, 500, 750, 1,000 μM) and UROtsa were treated with
nicotine (0, 1, 2.5, 5 μM) and NNK (0, 100, 200, 400 μM) for 1 h at 37 °C. Genomic
DNA and cell lysate isolation from these cells was the same as described (28).
PdG and O6-medG Adduct Detection. Cyclic PdG and O6-medG adducts formed
in the genomic DNA were determined by the immunochemical slot blot
hybridization method using Acr-dG and O6-medG antibodies and quantum
dot labeled second antibody, as described (13, 28). PdG adducts formed
in cultured human cells, and mouse lung tissue were further analyzed by the
32P postlabeling-2D-TLC/HPLC method, as previously described (28).
In Vitro DNA-Damage-Dependent Repair Synthesis Assay. The DNA-repair ac-
tivity was assessed by an in vitro DNA damage-dependent repair synthesis
assay, as previously described (13).
DNA Repairs Proteins Detection. The levels of XPC and OGG1/2 proteins in lung
tissues of mice with and without ECS exposure, and in BEAS-2B and UROtsa
cells treated with nicotine and NNK, were determined, as described (13).
Mutation Susceptibility Determination. Shuttle vector pSP189 plasmids, which
contain the tyrosine suppressor tRNA coding gene the supF, were UV (1,500 J/m2)
irradiated or modified with H2O2 (100 mM, 1 h at 37 °C), then transfected
into cells with and without pretreated with nicotine and NNK for 1 h
at 37 °C. Mutations in the supF mutations were detected, as previously
described (13).
Anchorage-Independent Soft-Agar Growth. Lung (BEAS-2B) and bladder
(UROtsa) epithelial cells were treated with NNK (0.5 mM) and nicotine
(25 and 5 mM) for 1 h at 37 °C; these treatments rendered 50% cell killing.
The method for anchorage-independent soft-agar growth is the same as
previously described (28).
Statistical Analysis. Statistical analysis and graphs were performed with Prism
6 (GraphPad) software. Two group comparisons were conducted with the
unpaired, two-tailed Mann–Whitney u test or the unpaired, two-tailed t test
with Welsh’s correction for unequal variances. A P value <0.05 was consid-
ered to be significant.
