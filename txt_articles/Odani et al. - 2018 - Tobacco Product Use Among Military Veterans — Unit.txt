Tobacco Product Use Among Military Veterans — United States, 2010–2015
Satomi Odani, MPH1; Israel T. Agaku, DMD, PhD1; Corinne M. Graffunder, DRPH1; Michael A. Tynan1; Brian S. Armour, PhD1
In 2015, an estimated 18.8 million U.S. adults were 
military veterans (1). Although the prevalence of tobacco-
attributable conditions is high among veterans (2), there 
is a paucity of data on use of tobacco products, other than 
cigarettes, in this population. To monitor tobacco product 
use among veterans, CDC analyzed self-reported current (i.e., 
past 30-day) use of five tobacco product types (cigarettes, 
cigars [big cigars, cigarillos, or little cigars], roll-your-own 
tobacco, pipes, and smokeless tobacco [chewing tobacco, 
snuff, dip, or snus]) from the National Survey on Drug Use 
and Health (NSDUH). Overall, 29.2% of veterans reported 
current use of any of the assessed tobacco products. Cigarettes 
were the most commonly used tobacco product (21.6%), 
followed by cigars (6.2%), smokeless tobacco (5.2%), roll-
your-own tobacco (3.0%), and pipes (1.5%); 7.0% of vet-
erans currently used two or more tobacco products. Within 
subgroups of veterans, current use of any of the assessed 
tobacco products was higher among persons aged 18–25 years 
(56.8%), Hispanics (34.0%), persons with less than a high 
school diploma (37.9%), those with annual family income 
<$20,000 (44.3%), living in poverty (53.7%), reporting 
serious psychological distress (48.2%), and with no health 
insurance (60.1%). By age and sex subgroups, use of any of 
the assessed tobacco products was significantly higher among 
all veteran groups than their nonveteran counterparts, except 
males aged ≥50 years. Expanding the reach of evidence-based 
tobacco control interventions among veterans could reduce 
tobacco use prevalence in this population.
NSDUH is an annual, in-person survey of the civilian, non-
institutionalized U.S. population aged ≥12 years conducted 
at the respondent’s residence (3). The analyses in this report 
were restricted to adults aged ≥18 years. Data were pooled for 
2010–2015 to increase statistical precision of estimates. Pooled 
sample size for adults aged ≥18 years was 238,917; annual 
response rate averaged 65.4%.*
Military veterans were those who had “ever been in the United 
States Armed Forces” and were “now separated/retired from 
reserves/active duty” (pooled n = 13,140). Nonveterans were 
* Data are collected annually through handheld computer-assisted face-to-face 
interviews, using a combination of interviewer-administered and respondent 
self-administered questions. Sample sizes and response rates for adult population 
were 39,069; 65.9% (2010); 38,965; 64.7% (2011); 37,657; 67.1% (2012); 
37,250; 64.5% (2013); 41,520; 61.2% (2014), and 43,401; 69.2% (2015). 
Of the 238,917 adults in the pooled sample, 13,140 were veterans, 224,648 
were nonveterans, 1,040 were currently in a reserve component, and 89 did 
not provide an answer.
those who had never been in the United States Armed Forces 
(pooled n = 224,648).† Respondents who reported currently 
being in a reserve component, or did not provide an answer 
 
were excluded from the analyses. Current users of cigarettes, 
cigars, roll-your-own tobacco, pipes, and smokeless tobacco 
were persons who had used the respective products during the 
past 30 days. Any tobacco product use was defined as use of 
any of the five assessed tobacco product types. Respondents 
who reported use of two or more tobacco product types during 
the past 30 days were further classified as current users of two 
or more tobacco product types.§ Prevalence estimates were 
calculated overall and by sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, 
annual family income, poverty status,¶ marital status, presence 
of serious psychological distress,** and health insurance cover-
age.†† Additionally, age- and sex-specific prevalence estimates 
were calculated among veterans and nonveterans separately 
to allow direct comparisons of the two groups, given differ-
ences between veterans and nonveterans by age and sex.§§ 
Cigarette quit ratio was calculated as the proportion of former 
 † To determine military veteran status, respondents were asked two questions. 
The first question was “Have you ever been in the United States Armed Forces?” 
Categorical response options were “Yes” or “No.” Those who answered “Yes” 
were then asked “Are you currently on active duty in the United States Armed 
Forces, are you in a Reserve component, or are you now separated or retired 
from the military?” Categorical response options were “On active duty in the 
Armed Forces,” “In a reserve component” or “Now separated/retired from 
reserves/active duty.” Persons who reported currently being on active duty were 
not included in the survey. Respondents who reported currently being in a 
reserve component (1,040; 0.4% of respondents) and those did not provide an 
answer (89; 0.04% of respondents) were excluded from the analysis.
 § For the use of any tobacco product types and two or more tobacco product types, 
respondents who had at least one missing response to any of the five tobacco 
product type questions were excluded from the analysis (76; 0.03% of respondents).
 ¶ Poverty status was assessed in National Survey on Drug Use and Health since 
2003. Poverty status indicates a person’s family income relative to Federal 
poverty thresholds. https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/

** The Kessler Serious Psychological Distress is a series of six questions that asks 
about feelings of sadness, nervousness, restlessness or fidgetiness, worthlessness, 
hopelessness, and feeling like everything is an effort during the past 30 days. 
Responses were scored on a Likert Scale ranging from “None of the time” 
(score = 0) to “All of the time” (score = 4). Responses were summed over the 
six questions; scores could range from 0–24. Respondents with a score ≥13 
were coded as having serious psychological distress, and respondents with a 
score <13 were coded as not having serious psychological distress. https://

†† Respondents were classified as being insured if they had private insurance, 
Medicare, Medicaid/HIPCOV, Champus, ChampVA, VA, Military, or other 
health insurance. Among veterans, weighted proportions of those insured and 
uninsured were 94.3% and 5.7%, respectively.
 
§§ Veteran and nonveteran populations differed in distributions of sex (males: 
93.1% versus 43.2%, veterans and nonveterans, respectively) and age (persons 
aged ≥50 years: 76.2% versus 40.3%, veterans and nonveterans, respectively).

cigarette smokers (persons who smoked ≥100 cigarettes dur-
ing lifetime, but did not smoke in past 12 months) among 
ever cigarette smokers (persons who smoked ≥100 cigarettes 
during lifetime); quit ratios were not calculated for the other 
noncigarette tobacco products because of the absence of life-
time usage thresholds to distinguish actual former users from 
experimenters. The proportion of former cigarette smokers 
who still reported current (past 30-day) use of any nonciga-
rette tobacco product (cigars, roll-your-own tobacco, pipes, 
and smokeless tobacco) was computed to determine complete 
tobacco abstinence among those who had quit cigarette smok-
ing. Within-group differences and differences between veterans 
and nonveterans were assessed with Chi-squared tests, and 
trends in estimates were tested with logistic regression using 
orthogonal polynomials, with statistical significance at p<0.05. 
Estimates with relative standard errors ≥30% were suppressed.
Among veterans overall, 29.2% reported current use of any 
tobacco product, and 7.0% reported current use of two or 
more tobacco products (Table 1). By tobacco product type, 
current use was highest for cigarettes (21.6%), followed by 
cigars (6.2%), smokeless tobacco (5.2%), roll-your-own 
tobacco (3.0%), and pipes (1.5%). Significant differences 
existed within veteran subgroups in current use of any tobacco 
product. Prevalence was lowest among persons who were 
aged ≥50 years (23.8%), non-Hispanic white (28.3%), had 
a college degree or higher (17.2%), an annual family income 
of ≥$75,000 (23.9%), living at more than twice the Federal 
Poverty Threshold (25.2%), married (24.3%), did not report 
serious psychological distress (28.5%), and were insured 
(27.3%). Prevalence was highest among persons who were 
aged 18–25 years (56.8%), Hispanic (34.0%), had less than 
a high school diploma (37.9%), an annual family income of 
<$20,000 (44.3%), were living in poverty (53.7%), were never 
married (43.4%), who reported serious psychological distress 
(48.2%), and who were uninsured (60.1%).
The prevalence of current use of any tobacco product was 
significantly higher among veterans than nonveterans in all age 
and sex strata, except males aged ≥50 years (Table 2). Among 
both veterans and nonveterans, the prevalence of any tobacco 
product use was significantly higher among males than among 
females in each age stratum, except veterans aged ≥50 years.
Cigarette quit ratio estimates were not significantly different 
among veterans and nonveterans in any age/sex stratum except 
females aged 18–25 years (18.7%, veterans versus 10.4% non-
veterans), females aged ≥50 years (50.8% versus 62.1%); and 
males aged ≥50 years (72.4% versus 61.1%,) (p<0.05) (Figure). 
For both veterans and nonveterans, sex-specific quit ratios 
increased with increasing age (p<0.05 for trend). Current use of 
noncigarette tobacco products among former cigarette smokers 
was not significantly different among veterans and nonveterans 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
In the United States, the prevalence of adverse health condi-
tions caused by tobacco use is particularly high among 
veterans; however, data on use of tobacco products other than 
cigarettes in this population are limited.
What is added by this report?
Analysis of data from the 2010–2015 National Survey on Drug 
Use and Health indicates that 29.2% of veterans reported current 
tobacco product use. Cigarettes were the most commonly used 
tobacco product (21.6%), followed by cigars (6.2%), smokeless 
tobacco (5.2%), roll-your-own tobacco (3.0%), and pipes (1.5%); 
7.0% of veterans currently used two or more tobacco products. 
Within veteran subgroups, current use of any of the assessed 
tobacco products was higher among persons aged 18–25 years 
(56.8%), Hispanics (34.0%), persons who had not completed high 
school (37.9%), whose annual family income was <$20,000 
(44.3%), were living in poverty (53.7%), who reported serious 
psychological distress (48.2%), and who had no health insurance 
(60.1%). By age and sex subgroups, any tobacco product use was 
significantly higher among all veteran groups than their nonvet-
eran counterparts, except males aged ≥50 years.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Evidence-based tobacco control interventions can be imple-
mented to reach veterans, which could reduce tobacco use 
prevalence and tobacco-attributable disease and death among 
this population. Strategies could include promoting cessation to 
current military personnel and veterans, implementing tobacco-
free policies at military installations and Veterans Affairs medical 
centers and clinics, increasing the age requirement to buy 
tobacco on military bases to 21 years, and eliminating tobacco 
product discounts through military retailers.
in any age/sex stratum except males aged 35–49 years (26.4% 
versus 17.9%, veterans versus nonveterans), and males aged 
≥50 years (8.6% versus 11.7%) (p<0.05). Although sex-specific 
prevalence of noncigarette tobacco product use decreased with 
increasing age among nonveterans (p<0.05 for trend), trends 
were not significant for veterans.
Discussion
During 2010–2015, close to three in 10 U.S. veterans were 
current users of any tobacco products, and prevalence of use of 
any tobacco product was higher among veterans than among 
nonveterans within all subgroups of age and sex, except males 
aged ≥50 years. Evidence-based strategies can help veterans quit 
tobacco use, including quitline services (e.g., 1–855-QUIT-
VET and 1–800-QUIT-NOW¶¶); text messaging services (e.g., 
https://www.publichealth.va.gov/smoking/smokefreevet.asp); 
web resources (e.g., https://www.publichealth.va.gov/smoking/

 * Veterans were persons who reported having ever been in the U.S. Armed Forces and being separated or retired from reserves/active duty at the time of the survey 
(pooled n = 13,140). Nonveterans were persons who reported having never been in the U.S. Armed Forces (pooled n = 224,648).

seling; and use of FDA approved cessation medications. 
Additionally, CDC’s Tips From Former Smokers’ Campaign 
(https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/index.html) 
features real stories of smokers, including military service 
members and veterans who live with smoking-related diseases 
and disabilities, to motivate smokers to quit.***
Despite similar quit ratios among veterans and nonveterans, 
the prevalence of current cigarette smoking was higher among 
veterans in most age groups. These findings are consistent with 
those of previous studies showing high rates of smoking initia-
tion among military personnel (4,5). Approximately 38% of 
current military smokers initiate tobacco use after enlisting in 
military service (6). Factors encouraging or enabling tobacco 
use in the military include stress, peer influence, and easy access 
to cheap tobacco products (7,8).
The high prevalence of tobacco use among military personnel 
and veterans also has a significant financial impact. During 2010, 
the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) spent an estimated 
$2.7 billion (7.6% of the VHA expenditures on health services for 
which the cost of smoking could be attributed) on smoking-related 
 *** https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/groups/military.html.
ambulatory care, prescription drugs, hospitalization, and home 
health care for the segment of the veteran population receiving 
VHA services (2). Tobacco use among active military personnel 
can eventually contribute to VHA expenditures as these become 
veterans. Reducing tobacco use among both active duty military 
and veterans can therefore result in a substantial reduction in 
tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and billions of dollars 
in savings from averted medical costs.
Implementation of evidence-based tobacco control interven-
tions among military and veteran populations can help reduce 
prevalence by preventing initiation and relapse, and encouraging 
quitting. Because more than a third of current smokers in active 
duty military initiate smoking after enlistment (6), and because 
veterans continue to have access to military installations after retire-
ment from the military, interventions that impact both current 
and former military members are important to reduce tobacco use 
among veterans. Strategies could include promoting cessation to 
current military personnel and veterans, implementing tobacco-
free policies at military installations and Veterans Affairs medical 
centers and clinics, increasing the age requirement to buy tobacco 
on military bases to 21 years, and eliminating tobacco product 
discounts through military retailers (9,10).

* Noncigarette tobacco product includes cigars, roll-your-own tobacco, pipes, and smokeless tobacco. 
† Cigarette quit ratio was calculated as the proportion of former smokers (persons who smoked ≥100 cigarettes during lifetime and did not smoke in the past 12 months) 
among ever smokers (persons who smoked ≥100 cigarettes during lifetime).
§ Veterans were individuals who reported having ever been in the U.S. Armed Forces and currently being separated or retired from reserves/active duty at the time 
of the survey (pooled n = 13,140). Nonveterans were individuals who reported having never been in the U.S. Armed Forces (pooled n = 224,648). Prevalence of 
current use of noncigarette tobacco product among former smokers was significantly different among veterans and nonveterans in males aged 35–49 years and 
males aged ≥50 years (p<0.05). Cigarette quit ratios were significantly different among veterans and nonveterans in females aged 18–25 years; males aged 
≥50 years; and females aged ≥50 years (p<0.05).  
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, these cross-sectional data do not allow a comparison 
of prevalence estimates for the same cohort as they age. Second, 
the definition of veterans used in this study possibly includes 
persons who served in the U.S. Armed Forces but might not 
meet the statutory definition of “veterans” (e.g., dishonorably 
discharged persons). Third, data were not available for newer 
tobacco products such as hookah and electronic cigarettes. 
Fourth, these analyses used data pooled from multiple years; 
therefore, only time-averaged prevalence estimates could be 
assessed. Finally, multivariable analyses were not performed 
to identify independent predictors of tobacco use, especially 
among subgroups where multiple risk factors for tobacco use 
might exist simultaneously.

The health and economic costs of tobacco use among veter-
ans are high (2). Opportunities exist to make tobacco products 
less acceptable and accessible for both active duty military 
personnel and veterans. For example, U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs health care facilities are required by Federal law 
to have designated smoking areas.††† Progress has been made 
in recent years in promoting tobacco cessation and denormal-
izing smoking among military personnel and veterans. This 
includes VHA’s efforts to increase access to tobacco use treat-
ment options§§§ as well as the U.S. Department of Defense’s 
(DOD) prohibition of tobacco use on DOD medical campuses

and medical treatment facilities, with a goal to achieve tobacco-
free installations by 2020.¶¶¶ Continued implementation of 
these and other evidence-based tobacco control interventions 
on military and veteran facilities can help reduce tobacco use 
and tobacco-attributable disease and death among veterans.
