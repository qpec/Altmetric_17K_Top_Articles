Introduction
Fucoidans are polysaccharides containing substantial con-
tents of fucose and sulfate ester groups, which are constitu-
ents of brown seaweed and marine invertebrates, like sea 
urchins and sea cucumbers.1 Fucoidans are composed of 
monosaccharides (mannose, galactose, glucose, xylose), 
uronic acids, acetyl groups, and proteins. They show a wide 
spectrum of biological effects, such as anticoagulant and 
antithrombotic properties, and antiviral, antitumor, antioxi-
dant, and anticomplement functions.2-4 Fucoidans also have a 
variety of immune-modulation effects, such as promoting 
activation of macrophages, induction of dendritic cells, natu-
ral killer cells, and T-cells, and enhancing antiviral and anti-
tumor responses.2-5
Polysaccharides display the highest biological properties 
among macromolecules. Many polysaccharides obtained

Abstract
Objectives: To evaluate potential hepatic metabolism-mediated drug interactions with fucoidan from Undaria pinnatifida 
(UPF) or Fucus vesiculosus (FVF) and potential growth inhibition activity with either fucoidan alone or with chemotherapy. In 
vivo studies were done to confirm safety and investigate fucoidan-mediated immune modulation. Methods: Cytochrome 
P450 (CYP450) 3A4, 2C8, 2C9, and 2D6 inhibition experiments were conducted in vitro followed by an ex vivo human 
hepatocytes model to evaluate the CYP450 induction potential of each fucoidan at highest theoretical concentrations. 
Four hepatic metabolism phase II pathways—glutathione S transferase (GST), quinone oxidoreductase (QOR), catechol-
O-methyltransferases (COMT), and uridine di-phosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)—were evaluated with 
validated immunoassays. Growth inhibition assays were performed with each fucoidan alone and in combination with 
chemotherapy agents in a panel of human cancer cell lines. In vivo studies evaluated safety and immune modualtion. 
Results: CYP450 inhibition was observed with FVF. The GST, QOR, and UGT pathways had no changes. UPF and FVF 
both interacted with COMT. No growth inhibitory activity in cancer cell lines was observed. UPF and FVF had synergistic 
activity with paclitaxel or tamoxifen and additive activity with topotecan. In vivo, FVF decreased HeLa human cervical 
tumor growth and both FVF and UPF decreased TOV-112D human ovarian tumor growth. Otherwise, no significant 
change in tumor growth was observed. FVF immune modulation of IgG and IL-6 was observed (p<0.03). Conclusion: At 
higher doses, UPF and FVF may have limited potential for drug-supplement interactions, with either CYP450 or COMT 
hepatic metabolism pathways. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate to confirm findings of fucoidans in combination 
with chemotherapy.

from natural sources such as plants and algae have antican-
cer properties. These include polysaccharides extracted 
from medicinal mushrooms and yeast glucans.6 The struc-
ture of these natural polysaccharides allows them to be used 
in conjugation with anticancer agents; however, the activity 
may vary depending on the unique extraction and purifica-
tion processes leading to variations in physiochemical and 
biopharmaceutical properties.7
The overall objective in this study was to determine the 
safety of Undaria pinnatifida and Fucus vesiculosus to sup-
port potential evaluation in prospective clinical trials in com-
bination with chemotherapy in the oncology arena to 
ultimately improve patient outcomes. Specifically, studies 
were done to define the hepatic metabolism pathways for 
fucoidans and potential for drug-herbal interactions. 
Furthermore, the activity of the fucoidan extracts in a panel 
of human cancer cell lines was evaluated to define the growth 
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each fucoidan extract alone 
and/or in combination with commonly used cytotoxic che-
motherapy agents. Finally, in vivo studies were completed to 
confirm safety of fucoidans in the presence of tumors and to 
investigate fucoidan-mediated immune modulation.
Materials and Methods
Fucoidans
In this study, the fucoidan extract from Undaria pinnatifida 
(UPF; Figure 1A) and the fucoidan extract from Fucus 
vesiculosus (FVF; Figure 1B) were prepared by Marinova 
Pty Ltd (Cambridge TAS, Australia). The carbohydrate pro-
files were defined using a gas chromatography (GC)–based 
method for the accurate determination of individual mono-
saccharide ratios in a sample. This method relies on the prep-
aration of acetylated alditol derivatives of the hydrolyzed 
samples established by Morvai-Vitányi and colleagues.8 The 
uronic acid content was determined by spectrophotometric 
analysis of the hydrolyzed compound in the presence of 
3-phenylphenol, based on a method described by Filisetti-
Cozzi and Carpita.9 Sulfate content was analyzed spectro-
photometrically using a barium sulfate (BaSO4) precipitation 
method (barium chloride [BaCl2] in gelatin), based on meth-
ods developed by Dodgson and Price.10 Finally, cations, 
including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and 
magnesium (Mg+), were determined by flame atomic absorp-
tion spectroscopy. Table 1 is a summary of the composition 
of UPF and FVF that were used in the preclinical studies in 
this research.
Cell Culture
All human cancer cell lines including HeLa (HPV 16+) and 
SiHa (HPV 16/18+) cervical cancer cell lines, MCF-7 
(ER+/PR+, COMT wild type) and ZR-75 (ER+/PR+, 
COMT wild-type) breast cancer cell lines, and TOV-112D 
(platinum-sensitive) ovarian cancer cell lines were obtained 
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, 
Manassas, VA). SKOV-3 GFP-Luc (platinum-resistant) 
ovarian cancer cell line was obtained from Cell Biolabs, Inc 
(San Diego, CA). The SiHa squamous cell cervical carci-
noma, HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma, and the MCF-7 
breast cancer cell lines were propagated in a media consist-
ing of EMEM. The SKOV3-GFP-Luc ovarian adenocarci-
noma cell line was propagated with media consisting of 
McCoy’s 5a medium. The ZR-75 breast cancer cell line was 
propagated in a media consisting of RPMI 1640, and TOV-
112d was propagated in a mixture of 1:1 MCDB 105 and 
medium 199 with 2 mM L-glutamine and Earl’s BSS 
adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM 
nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate, and 
10% FBS. All cell lines were grown in 75-cm2 culture flasks 
in 5% CO2 in air at 37°c to 90% confluence. Cell lines used 
for this study were maintained for less than 15 passages in 
order to prevent major changes in cell line characteristics.
Metabolism Studies
During the designing and planning of this preclinical 
research study, the achievable FVF or UPF human systemic 
plasma concentration data were unavailable to investiga-
tors. Hence, for all of the metabolism studies, the 0.2 mg/
mL concentration was selected as an estimate of the clini-
cally relevant concentration. This was based on the current 
estimated maximum recommended dosage of 3 g total daily

structure of UPF.

dose as instructed by the manufacturer, assuming 100% bio-
availability and using an estimated total blood volume of an 
average adult of 7 L. However, a recent study by Irhimeh 
and colleagues reported less than 0.6% oral bioavailability 
in human fucoidan pharmacokinetic studies.13 Therefore, 
concentrations used in these metabolism studies were above 
achievable plasma concentrations in humans so may not 
translate to the clinical setting. The concentrations of FVF 
or UPF used in the metabolism studies might be achievable 
in animal models with smaller total volume or in the human 
gut for short-term (2-4 hours) during transit through gastro-
intestinal tract, but animal plasma concentration of FVF or 
UPF data were also not available.
Phase I Inhibition Assay. The highest analytical grade avail-
able chemicals and reagents were used. As mentioned 
earlier, the UPF and FVF were provided by Marinova Pty 
Ltd (Cambridge TAS 7170, Australia). All other chemi-
cals and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St 
Louis, MO).
Cytochrome P450 enzyme microsomes. The group of iso-
enzyme microsomes, CYP450 3A4, 2C8, and 2C9, were 
acquired from BD Biosciences (Gentest) Discovery Lab-
ware (Woburn, MA). The stated total protein content for 
the isozymes packaged in 0.5 mL aliquots is 5.8 mg/mL in 
100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and corresponding 
CYP450 content is 1000 pmol/mL. These isozymes were 
utilized in accordance with provided Material Safety Data 
Sheets and technical bulletins.
High-throughput CYP450 inhibition assays. A validated 
high-throughput method for measuring CYP450 inhibi-
tion method that was provided by BD Gentest was used 
to develop the assay protocol. In brief, the test com-
pounds (UPF and FVF), positive controls (ketoconazole, 
quercetin, quinidine, and sulfaphenazole), and substrates 
(dibenzylfluorescein and 3-(2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methyl-
ammonium)ethyl)-7-methoxy-4-methylcoumarin iodide 
[AMMC]) were used to study this potential inhibition of 
CYP450 substrates.11 The manufacturer’s methods were 
used to prepare the common solutions, enzyme/substrate 
mixes, cofactors stocks, and positive control solutions. 
A final cofactor solution was prepared consisting of 1.3 
mM of NADP+, 3.3 mM of glucose-6-phosphate, 0.4 
Units/mL of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 
3.3 mM of magnesium ion and then 200 µL of the cofac-
tor solution was added in each reaction well of a 96-well 
titer plate. After the addition of CYP450 enzyme, the 
appropriate substrate (DBF at 100 µM or AMMC at 500 
µM) and 58.3 µM of the inhibitor positive control were 
added to the reaction mixture and serially diluted 1: 3 for 
8 wells. The experimental wells on each plate had either 
the low or high concentrations of FVF of either 285 µg/
mL or 1.300 µg/mL or low or high concentrations of UPF 
of either 14 µg/mL or 285 µg/mL that also was then seri-
ally diluted 1:3 for 8 wells. The reactions were incubated 
for 30 to 60 minutes at 37°C and reactions were stopped 
with the addition of “stopping solutions” consisting of 
80:20 ratio of acetonitrile–TRIS base solution (CYP450 
2D6 only) or 2M NaOH solution for all of the other 
CYP450 isoenzymes. In each reaction well, IC50 values 
were used to quantify and report CYP450 inhibition. 
These data were produced by comparing the metabolism 
during assay reactions containing varied concentrations 
in the presence and absence of the known positive con-
trol inhibitor. The amount of substrate metabolized for 
the control comparison reactions was determined via 
fluorescence emission detection with FL600 Dual-Band 
plate reader from BioTek Instruments, Inc (Winooski, 
VT). The wavelength measured was at 528 nm (excita-
tion 485 nm) of fluorescein (metabolite product of DBF 
metabolism by CYP450) or at 460 nm (excitation 360) 
of 3-(2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methyl ammonium)ethyl)-7-hy-
droxy-4-methylcoumarin (AMHC; metabolite product of 
AMMC).

according to the supplier’s instructions and were thawed, 
isolated, and plated according to the supplier’s protocol. 
The cells were incubated for at least 48 hours at 37°C 
(5% CO2) to allow stabilization before use. Hepato-
cytes were replated using supplemented Hepatozyme 
SFM media (Gibco Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, 
CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-
Products, West Sacramento, CA) and 250 µM ascorbic 
acid (Sigma-Aldrich). Hepatocytes were then maintained 
in SFM media for the 7-day duration of the study. Pri-
mary hepatocyte cells were plated into separate 6-well 
Collagen I–coated plates for the CYP450 induction and 
substrate experiments, respectively. The cultures were 
prepared in triplicate for each experimental time point.
An ex vivo model of cryopreserved human hepatocytes 
was used to evaluate the ability of each fucoidan extract, UPF 
or FVF, to induce CYP450 metabolism for CYP450 3A4, 
2C8/2C9, and 2D6 enzymes. A known substrate for each iso-
enzyme was selected, including diclofenac (CYP450 2D6), 
dextromethorphan 
(CYP450 
2C8/2C9), 
or 
docetaxel 
(CYP450 3A4). The experiment was set up in triplicate using 
each known substrate alone, a control inducer of all 4 CYP450 
isoenzymes, rifampicin 25 µM (Sigma-Aldrich) with the 
known substrate, then a low and high concentration of each of 
the fucoidan extracts UPF 14 µg or 285 µg/mL and FVF 285 
µg or 1300 µg/mL and using known substrates diclofenac 
(2D6), dextromethorphan (2C8/2C9), and docetaxel (3A4). 
The hepatocytes were treated for a total of 72 hours with 
either the control inducer rifampicin or either FVF or UPF 
with media changes every 24 hours. After 72 hours, rifampi-
cin or fucoidan products were removed and the appropriate 
substrate concentration specific to the CYP450 isoenzyme of 
interest or specific to the test substrate (fucoidan products) 
were added. Samples were taken at different time points, start-
ing at time 0, 2.0 6.0, and 24 hours. Known inducer, substrate, 
and test sample were set on a 96-well plate and absorbance 
was read at the appropriate wavelength for the test substrate.
Phase II Enzyme Inhibition Studies
GST metabolism inhibition assay. GST activity was evalu-
ated using a slightly modified method described by Man-
nervik and Guthenberg.12 The assays were carried out in 200 
µL total volume, 96-well ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) plates 
(Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The reaction of 1 mM 
GSH with 1 mM 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in the presence 
of 2 µL human liver S9 fraction (20 mg/mL), diluted in 1 M 
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), was measured by UV 
absorbance on Synergy HT multi-detection microplate reader 
(BioTek Instruments, Inc) at 340 nm. UPF 14 µg or 285 µg/
mL and FVF 285 µg or 1300 µg/mL were added as the test/
experimental agents and serially diluted 1:3 for 8 wells. Ethac-
rynic acid (6 µM) is a broad inhibitor of GST activity and was 
selected as a positive control inhibitor of GST activity and 
was added to wells serially diluted 1:3 for 8 wells as well.14
UGT metabolism inhibition assay. UGT activity was 
evaluated following a method described by Liu and Frank-
lin.15 Inhibition assays were carried out in 200 µL total 
volume, 96-well UV-Vis plates. The 3 primary isoforms 
of UGT associated with drug metabolism were evaluated: 
UGT1A3, UGT1A6, and UGT2B17. Substrates for each 
isoform included estrone (UGT1A3), 1-napthol (UGT1A6), 
and testosterone (UGT2B17). In short, the reaction of 2 
mM uridine 5′-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) with 
each respective substrate in the presence of 2 µL human 
liver microsomes (20 mg/mL), diluted in 50 mM potassium 
phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), was measured by UV absorbance 
on a FL600 Dual-Band plate reader (BioTek Instruments, 
Inc) at either 220 nm (UGT1A6) or 230 nm (UGT1A3 and 
UGT2B17). UPF or FVF was added as the test/experimen-
tal agents using either UPF 14 µg or 285 µg/mL or FVF 
285 µg or 1300 µg/mL and serially diluted 1:3 for 8 wells. 
Removal of UDPGA was used as a negative control.
QOR metabolism inhibition assay. QOR activity was 
evaluated using the method described by Benson and col-
leagues.16 Assays were carried out in 96-well UV-Vis plates 
with total volume of 200 µL per well. The reaction mixtures 
contained 0.7 mg of bovine serum albumin, 25 mM Tris-
HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 mM NADPH, 40 µM 2,6-dichlorophe-
nolindophenol (DCPIP), and control inhibitor, dicoumarol 
10 mM. As with the UGT assay, UPF or FVF was added as 
the test/experimental agents using either UPF 14 µg or 285 
µg/mL or FVF 285 µg or 1300 µg/mL, then serially diluted 
1:3 for 8 wells. NADPH was measured by UV absorbance 
at 200 nm or DCPIP at 600 nm on a FL600 Dual-Band plate 
reader from BioTek Instruments, Inc.
COMT metabolism induction study. The cryopreserved 
human hepatocytes obtained from Corning (Gentest Dis-
covery Labware) were replated using supplemented 
hepatozyme SFM media (Gibco Invitrogen Corporation) 
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products) 
and 250 µM ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in 6-well col-
lagen-coated culture plates. Cells were allowed to adhere 
for 8 hours prior to removal of seeding media. Hepatocytes 
were maintained in un-supplemented hepatozyme SFM 
media for at least 24 hours prior to the study being initiated. 
For the COMT method, primary hepatocyte cells were incu-
bated with 500 ng/mL 17-β estradiol in the presence of UPF 
14 µg or 285 µg/mL and FVF 285 µg or 1300 µg/mL. Fucoi-
dans were compared to the control known inducer, folic 
acid 150 ng/mL.17 Estradiol concentrations remaining at 
each time point were determined by employing a validated 
high-pressure liquid chromatography assay with ultravio-
let absorbance detection according to parameters described 
in the CDER Guidance for Industry Bioanalytical Assay 
Method Validation detection.18 Briefly, 17-β-estradiol was 
isolated from spiked hepatozyme media with liquid-liquid

extraction with n-hexane. Liquid chromatographic separa-
tion was achieved by isocratic elution on a Waters Bondpak 
C18, 4.6 × 250 mm, 10 µm particle size analytical column 
(Milford, MA). The mobile phase consisted of an isocratic 
flow of 50:50 deionized water-acetronitrile at a flow rate 
of 1.0 mL/minute and total run time of 15 minutes. The 
17-β-estradiol peak was positively identified from other 
peaks using UV absorbance at a wavelength of 200 nm. 
Assay had sensitivity with lower limit of detection of 0.05 
ng/mL and was linear from 0.25 µg/mL to 25 µg/mL.
UGT metabolism induction study. For the UGT method, 
primary hepatocyte cells were incubated with 150 µM 
estrone (for UGT1A3) and 600 µM 1-naphthol (for 
UGT1A6) in presence of UPF 14 µg or 285 µg/mL and FVF 
285 µg or 1300 µg/mL. Fucoidan was compared to control 
β-naptholflavone 80 µM. The cultures were maintained 
in duplicate for each experimental time point, including 2 
hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours. To determine UGT induction, 
remaining substrate concentrations in samples were mea-
sured with FL600 Dual-Band plate reader from BioTek 
Instruments, Inc using UV detection at 230 nm for estrone 
(UGT1A3) and at 280 nm for 1-naphthol (UGT1A6).
In Vitro Growth Inhibition Studies
Fucoidan Alone Study. Growth inhibition assays were con-
ducted as previously described.19 Briefly, cells were plated 
at 2500 to 5000 cells per well in 96-well plate and incubated 
at 37°C for 24 hours. Each of the cancer cell lines were 
treated with 50 µL of various concentrations of fucoidan 
extracts, UPF or FVF, starting at 300 µg/mL for low or 
1300 µg/mL for high followed by serial dilutions for the 
remaining 9 columns of wells. For the cell growth inhibi-
tion studies fresh stock solutions were prepared in media of 
each respective cell line for each experiment. Control wells 
had media alone and blank wells had no cells, drug, or 
media. After a 72-hour incubation period, 25 µL of 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bro-
mide (MTT) was added to obtain a final concentration of 
300 µg/mL, and cells were incubated for 2 hours. Plates 
were then centrifuged and the supernatant was removed. 
Afterwards, 50 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each 
well and absorbance at 563 nm was measured. The inhibi-
tory concentration to achieve 50% cell death (IC50) for each 
fucoidan extract and each cell line were calculated.
Fucoidan Extracts in Combination With Selected Chemotherapy 
Agents. Combination agent growth inhibition assays were 
done using IC50 concentration of one of the selected chemo-
therapy agents including topotecan, gemcitabine, pacli-
taxel, carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil, tamoxifen, and letrozole 
with UPF 300 µg/mL or FVF 1300 µg/mL for total of 72 
hours incubation and then growth inhibitory activity was 
evaluated. The IC50 was selected to ensure that enough via-
ble tissue was available for immunoblotting and flow 
cytometry experiments. After 72 hours growth inhibitory 
activity was evaluated as described above for the single 
agent studies. All experiments were done in quadruplicate.
To define synergy/additive activity for the in vitro 
growth inhibition assays the interaction index was used to 
determine antagonism, additive, or synergistic activity as 
described by Tallarida20 was determined with the following 
equation: γ = a/A + b/B, where A = dose of drug A alone that 
gives the specified effect; B = dose of drug B alone that 
gives specified effect; a = dose of drug A used in combina-
tion to achieve specified effect; and b = dose of drug B used 
in combination to achieve specified effect. The interaction 
index measures drug combination as follows: γ value equal 
to one it is additive; γ value less than one is synergistic and 
γ value greater than one is antagonistic.
In Vivo Study With Orthotopic Human Cancer 
Mouse Models
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee prior to ini-
tiating any animal work. For this study, 240 female nude 
mice, 6 to 8 weeks old, were obtained from Charles River 
Laboratories Wilmington, MA. All the mice weighed 
about 22 to 26 g and were maintained 5 per cage in spe-
cific pathogen free (SPF) barrier room, with a temperature 
of 22 ± 3°C and 45 ± 3°C RH% (relative humidity). They 
had free access to autoclaved food and reverse osmosis 
autoclaved water. The experiment procedures and the han-
dling of the mice were in strict accordance with the guide 
for the care and use of laboratory animals. The mice were 
divided into 4 groups of 10 for each cell line (N = 240 for 
6 cell lines). There were 4 arms of this study: 2 treatment 
arm (N = 10 each), no treatment control arm (N = 10), and 
a vehicle control arm (N = 10). The treatment arm received 
an oral dose (30.4 mg/kg, in 0.2 mL, gastric gavage) of 
UPF or FVF, which was selected based on estimated 
equivalent total daily dose of fucoidan of 2125 mg/daily in 
a 70-kg adult, the control arm received an oral dose of 
autoclaved water (0.2 mL, gastric gavage) per day starting 
on day 1 and continued until completion of the study (day 
28). The UPF and FVF were provided by Marinova Pty 
Ltd and were prepared to a final concentration of 152 mg/
mL in deionized purified water once a week and stored in 
2°C to 8°C for animal studies.
SiHa cells (3.0 × 106), HeLa, MCF-7, ZR-75, TOV-112D 
cells (5.0 × 106) were dispersed in PBS with 20% matrigel 
and injected subcutaneously (subQ), and each mouse grew 
one tumor on the dorsal surface. The SKOV3-GFP-Luc (5.0 
× 106) was injected intraperitoneal (IP) in female nu/nu mice 
on day zero. Tumor measurements were obtained 3times per 
week. The subQ tumors were measured with electronic

aUPF and FVF at both low and high concentrations had no effect on CYP450 2C8, 2C9, or 3A4 isoenzyme activity. UPF and FVF at both low and high 
concentrations showed induction of the CYP450 2D6 pathway.
calipers (Mitutoyo, Utsunomiya, Japan) and the IP tumors 
were imaged under Kodak Imaging Station (Kodak, 
Rochester, NY) once in a week, and abdominal girth was 
measured by using a measuring tape twice in a week. Blood 
was collected from facial vein from each group every week 
during the treatment period, plasma were separated and kept 
in −80°C freezer to evaluate selected panel of immune mark-
ers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), immunoglobulin G (IgG), 
interferon-α/β (IFN-α/β), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Mice 
were monitored daily for signs/symptoms of morbidity 
including but not limited to lethargy, weight loss, anorexia, 
hunching, or any signs of distress. Mice were sacrificed via 
CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation, when tumor 
diameter was greater than 12 mm2 or if there was greater 
than a 10% decrease in body weight found during the study 
period. At the end of the study all the remaining mice were 
sacrificed. When sacrificed, total tumor burden was deter-
mined by macroscopic dissection. Immediately after sacri-
fice, tumors were surgically removed from all mice and 
stored at −80°C.
Quantification of Selected Immune Markers
A selected panel of immune markers including IL-6, IgG, 
IFN-α/β), IFN-γ were evaluated from mouse blood samples 
collected weekly throughout the treatment. Standard vali-
dated ELISA assays for the detection of the selected immune 
marker including IL-6, IgG1, IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ 
were employed according to respective protocol from the 
manufacturer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). For each 
series of immunomarker determinations, a standard curve 
was constructed with known concentrations of these mark-
ers. Sandwich ELISAs for the detection of total IL-6, IgG1, 
IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ were performed and plasma con-
centrations of these 4 immune markers were calculated 
from respective standard graphs.
Statistical Analysis
All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate and 
repeated if the coefficient of variance was greater than 20%. 
Final results are described through appropriate summary sta-
tistics (eg, means, standard deviations, and correlation coef-
ficients). ANOVA was employed to determine differences in 
metabolism activity for each respective metabolic pathway, 
and Pearson’s correlation test was used to evaluate all cor-
relations. A paired t test was used to evaluate the viability in 
continuous data as appropriate. Results were considered to 
be significant when P > .05. The program GraphPad Prism 
5.02 (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA) was used to 
perform the analysis.

aUPF at low concentration had no effect on all of the CYP450 isoenzyme activities. The UPF high concentration showed inhibition of the 2C8 and 2C9 
pathway. FVF showed inhibition of all 4 enzyme pathways, 2C8, 2C9, 3A4, and 2D6, at both the high and low concentrations.

CYP450 2D6 pathway was observed when exposed to either 
UPF or FVF at the low and high concentrations.
Phase II Metabolism Pathways. UPF (low [14 µg/mL] and 
high [285 µg/mL] concentrations) and FVF (low [285 µg/
mL] and high [1300 µg/mL] concentrations) were 
observed to inhibit or induce the GST, QOR, and UGT path-
ways. In the COMT pathway, the UPF extract exhibited 
induction of COMT, which was less than the positive con-
trol inducer (folic acid). However, the FVF extract exhib-
ited inhibition of COMT pathway (see Table 3).
In Vitro Growth Inhibition Activity
As anticipated, none of the fucoidan compounds consis-
tently achieved a concentration with 50% inhibition (IC50) 
that was reproducible across all cell lines. We did observe 
slightly more activity with the FVF in 87% of cell lines 
compared to UPF in 53% of the cell lines across the concen-
tration ranges. In the screening of UPF and FVF, both fucoi-
dan extracts appeared to have overall synergistic activity 
given in combination with paclitaxel or tamoxifen and addi-
tive activity given in combination with topotecan (Table 4). 
There were some cell lines that despite overall antagonistic 
activity observed still had slight (10% to 15%) increase in 
growth inhibitory activity with the combination of fucoi-
dan/chemotherapy compared to the chemotherapy agent 
alone.
Single Agent Animal Studies
The animal studies definitely confirmed the safety of both 
UPF and FVF extracts in the presence of cancer. As single 
agent given by mouth once daily, neither fucoidan extract 
affected the growth or growth rate of human cancer ortho-
topic mouse models including ovarian cancer cell line 
SKOV3-GFP-Luc (platinum- resistant; Figure 2A) or TOV-
112d (platinum sensitive; Figure 2B); or breast cancer cell 
lines MCF-7 (COMT variant; Figure 3A), ZR-75 (COMT 
wild type; Figure 3B); or cervical cancer cell lines HeLa 
(HPV 16+; Figure 4A) or SiHa (HPV 16/18+; Figure 4B). 
In fact, FVF statistically decreased tumor growth in the 
HeLa (HPV 16+) human cervical cancer mouse model (P < 
.004). The TOV-112d human ovarian cancer mouse model 
had a statistically significant decrease in growth rate to both 
UPF (P < .001) and FVF (P < .001) after 30 days of 
supplementation.
Although duration of study was only short duration of 30 
days, fucoidan extract modulation of immune markers was 
observed. Daily supplementation with FVF demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in both IL-6 (P < .03) 
and IgG (P < .003) and some nonsignificant increases in 
IFN-α/β and IFN-γ (Table 5). UPF also had some trend in 
improvement in the panel of immune markers evaluated 
that did not reach statistical significance.
Discussion
Prospective evaluation of the safety of the use of nutritional 
supplements in the oncology patient population both during 
and off treatment is a priority in the oncology health care 
team. However, there is limited clinical information avail-
able, hence utilizing systematic preclinical studies can help 
gain knowledge and perspective on each nutritional supple-
ment. This systematic preclinical evaluation of 2 fucoidans, 
UPF or FVF, for use in oncology included evaluation of both 
phase I and phase II metabolism pathways to determine 
potential for drug/supplement interactions, in vitro single 
supplement and combination with chemotherapy growth 
inhibition evaluation in a panel of 15 human cancer cell lines 
and finally in vivo single agent studies were completed in 8 
selected human cancer orthotopic models to evaluate impact 
on tumor growth as well as confirm immune modulation 
activity. The phase I and phase II metabolism studies demon-
strated that UPF appears to have no potential for drug-sup-
plement interactions, and FVF showed only limited potential 
of interactions with CYP450 and COMT pathways. 
Additional studies are warranted to evaluate potential for 
synergistic activity between fucoidan compounds and pacli-
taxel, tamoxifen, and additive activity with topotecan that 
was observed in the in vitro growth inhibition studies. All 8 
animal models confirmed both UPF and FVF will not pro-
mote tumor growth and perhaps in few studies suggested 
may have some benefit to decrease tumor growth, likely

through immune modulation effects. The short-term expo-
sure of only 30 days in the animal studies did confirm in vivo 
immune modulation with both UPF and FVF.5
This was first study to complete a comprehensive evalua-
tion of both phase I and phase II hepatic metabolism of UPF 
and FVF to define any potential for drug/supplement interac-
tions. While there was synergistic activity with tamoxifen 
and paclitaxel in breast cancer cell lines in other studies, this 
was first study to also observe this in vitro synergistic activity 
in also 6 other cancers including ovarian, endometrial, cervi-
cal, prostate, hepatic carcinoma, and prostate cancers.21,22 
Immune modulation and potential mechanisms for antican-
cer activity of the fucoidan compounds has been observed in 
multiple preclinical studies throughout the literature. For 
example, Senthilkumar and colleagues recently published a 
summary review of all the current proposed mechanisms of 
brown seaweed fucoidans activity against cancer cell growth, 
immune modulation being cited as mechanism associated 
with UPF, which was also observed in this study.23 Immune 
modulation in preliminary human studies has also been con-
firmed.13 Based on the findings from this study, the next steps 
will be to complete preclinical screening to identify the

optimal combinations with chemotherapy and then proceed 
to clinical setting for prospective clinical trials. While it is 
unlikely to have any drug/supplement interactions based on 
the data from metabolism studies presented in this study as 
well as limited bioavailability observed by Irhimeh and col-
leagues, traditional pharmacokinetic/safety studies should be 
completed prior to proceeding to larger phase II studies for 
defining efficacy and role of combinations with fucoidans. In 
an initial small study by Ikeguchi and colleagues that evalu-
ated combination of fucoidan with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin 
plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin plus 
irinotecan (FOLFRI), the authors reported less fatigue, abil-
ity to have increased duration of treatment, and longer sur-
vival in the 10 patients that received fucoidan with 
chemotherapy compared to the 10 patients that had chemo-
therapy alone.24 While not statistically significant, this study 
supports that there is merit in continuing to evaluate and 
define the role of supplementation with fucoidans to optimize 
chemotherapy outcomes. A pharmacokinetic/safety study 
evaluating FOLFOX and paclitaxel/carboplatin in combina-
tion with fucoidan 500 mg twice a day is already underway as 
well.

The strengths of this study is that it was systematic pre-
clinical evaluation with in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo stud-
ies evaluating fucoidans, UPF and FVF. Evaluating both 
phase I (cytochrome P450) metabolism and also the phase 
II pathways (GST, UGT, QOR, and COMT) provided 
more complete information on potential for drug interac-
tions. Completing the in vitro screening in a diverse panel 
of human cancers allowed the consistency additive/syner-
gistic activity with paclitaxel, tamoxifen, and topotecan to 
be demonstrated. Finally, conducting 8 in vivo human can-
cer orthotropic mouse models demonstrated reproducibil-
ity and reliability of data that showed fucoidans do not 
promote tumor growth rate and perhaps its immune modu-
lation may contribute to inhibition of tumor growth but 
that data will need to be confirmed in future human stud-
ies. A definite limitation of this study was the concentra-
tions of fucoidans selected for the metabolism studies 
were well above what is clinically achievable based on 
Figure 4. (A) Summary of impact of fucoidan on rate for tumor growth in SiHa human cervical cancer mouse model. Both fucoidans 
showed no significant change in tumor growth. (B) Summary of impact of fucoidan on rate for tumor growth in HeLa human cervical 
cancer mouse model. FVF demonstrated a decrease in tumor growth. UPF showed tumor growth comparable to vehicle group.

preliminary pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volun-
teers.13 There were no metabolism pathway mediated 
interactions observed at the lowest 14 µg/mL concentra-
tion of fucoidans, which is still above plasma concentra-
tions observed in the human pharmacokinetic study where 
the maximum concentration achieved (cmax) was 2 µg/
mL.13 Perhaps higher concentrations might be achievable 
in animal models with smaller total volume or in the 
human gut for a short term (2-4 hours) during transit 
through gastrointestinal tract, but there are currently no 
data available on concentrations achieved in human gut 
after oral administration.
Conclusion
This comprehensive preclinical evaluation of 2 different 
types of fucoidans for use in oncology demonstrated 
overall that both UPF and FVF appear to have limited 
potential for any drug interactions at clinically achiev-
able concentrations. In the panel of human cancer cell 
lines evaluated, fucoidans did not have inherent cytotox-
icity activity alone but may have some additive or syner-
gistic activity with chemotherapy that needs further 
evaluation. Confirmatory animal studies are ongoing to 
evaluate potential with combination of selected chemo-
therapy agents. Finally, both UPF and FVF did not nega-
tively affect tumor growth in animal studies and some 
potential benefit was observed in these studies. Similar 
to other preclinical studies, immune modulation was also 
observed after short-term exposure to UPF and FVF. In 
conclusion, after evaluating multiple aspects in this 
series of preclinical studies, fucoidans overall appear to 
be safe to proceed to be evaluated in clinical studies to 
determine benefit of fucoidans alone or in combination 
with chemotherapy in oncology patients.
