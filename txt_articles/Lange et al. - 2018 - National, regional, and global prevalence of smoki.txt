National, regional, and global prevalence of smoking during 
pregnancy in the general population: a systematic review 
and meta-analysis
Shannon Lange, Charlotte Probst, Jürgen Rehm, Svetlana Popova
Summary
Background Smoking during pregnancy has been linked to numerous adverse health consequences for both the 
developing fetus and mother. We estimated the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy by country, WHO region, 
and globally and the proportion of pregnant women who smoked during pregnancy, by frequency and quantity, on a 
global level.
Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we did a comprehensive systematic literature search for studies 
reporting the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy in the general population, published between Jan 1, 1985 and 
Feb 1, 2016, using several electronic bibliographic databases (CINAHL, Embase, ERIC, Medline, Medline in process, 
PsychINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science), without language or geographical restrictions. We included original research 
studies published in a peer-reviewed journal and assessed study quality using a tool specifically developed for use in 
systematic reviews addressing questions of prevalence. Studies were excluded if they did not include lifetime 
non-smokers in their sample or estimate, used a sample not generalisable to the general population of the respective 
country, or did not provide primary data. To estimate the prevalence by country, we did country-specific random-effects 
meta-analyses for countries with two or more available empirical studies, and we predicted the prevalence using a 
multilevel fractional response regression model with country-specific indicators for countries with one or no study. We 
estimated the proportion of female daily smokers who do not quit once pregnant by calculating the regional and global 
averages of the prevalence of daily smoking during pregnancy and of the prevalence of daily smoking in women. To 
estimate the global prevalence, by frequency and quantity, we did random-effects meta-analyses using available data 
from all countries and applied the respective proportions to the global prevalence estimate. We did a time–trend 
analysis using a univariate multilevel fractional response model. The review protocol is available on PROSPERO, 
registration number CRD42017075837.
Findings Of 21 329 studies identified, 295 were retained for data extraction. We calculated estimates via meta-analysis for 
43 countries and via statistical modelling for 131 countries. The three countries with the highest estimated prevalence of 
smoking during pregnancy were Ireland (38·4%, 95% CI 25·4–52·4), Uruguay (29·7%, 16·6–44·8), and Bulgaria 
(29·4%, 26·6–32·2). The global prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was estimated to be 1·7% (95% CI 0·0–4·5). 
The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 8·1% (95% CI 4·0–12·2) in the European Region, 5·9% (3·2–8·6) in 
the Region of the Americas, 1·2% (0·7–1·7) in the Southeast Asian Region, 1·2% (0·0–3·7) in the Western Pacific 
Region, 0·9% (0·0–1·9) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and 0·8% (0·0–2·2) in the African Region. Globally, 
72·5% (95% CI 70·4–75·0) of pregnant women who smoked were daily smokers, and 27·5% (25·4–29·6) of them were 
occasional smokers; 51·8% (95% CI 50·0–53·5) women who smoked were light smokers, 34·8% (33·1–36·4) were 
moderate smokers, and 13·5% (12·3–14·7) were heavy smokers. Furthermore, the proportion of women who smoked 
daily and continued to smoke daily during pregnancy was 52·9% (95% CI 45·6–60·3), ranging from 30·6% (95% CI 
25·6–36·4) in the European Region to 79·6% (44·2–100·0) in the Western Pacific Region.
Interpretation Smoking during pregnancy is still a prevalent behaviour in many countries. These findings should 
inform smoking prevention programmes and health promotion strategies, as well as draw attention to the need for 
improved access to smoking cessation programmes for pregnant women.

Introduction
Smoking tobacco during pregnancy is associated with 
a number of pregnancy complications such as 
ectopic pregnancy, placental abruption, placenta praevia, 
pre-eclampsia, and a range of poor fetal outcomes such 
as fetal mortality, stillbirth, and tobacco-induced abor-
tions.1–6 Preterm birth, low birthweight, and sudden 
infant death syndrome are also linked to smoking during

pregnancy, with established causality.1,2,7,8 Evidence also 
suggests an association between smoking during 
pregnancy and major birth malformations such as oral 
clefts, craniosynostosis, gastroschisis,1,9,10 and intellectual 
impairment later in life.1,11,12
Economic estimates have shown that the expenditures 
of medical care that are attributable to birth complications 
are much higher for women who smoke during 
pregnancy than for non-smokers.13 This association 
suggests that the birth complications of women who 
smoke during pregnancy are more severe and need more 
intense interventions than those of women who do not 
smoke during pregnancy. However, the magnitude of 
such smoking-attributable health-care expenditures has 
decreased over time.14,15
Alarmingly, surveillance data from the Global Youth 
Tobacco Surveys16 suggest that the difference in the 
prevalence of smoking between the two sexes is narrowing, 
especially in low-income and middle-income countries. In 
view of the effects of smoking on reproduction, these data 
underscore the importance of sex-specific prevalence 
estimates, especially for women of childbearing age.
On the basis of findings from the Global Burden of 
Disease Study, WHO recently reported that the global age-
standardised prevalence of daily smoking in women in 
2015 was 5·4%.17 However, although the detrimental 
health effects of smoking during pregnancy are well 
established, to the best of our knowledge no estimates 
exist of the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy for 
all countries. In one notable study, Caleyachetty and 
colleagues18 estim 
ated the prevalence of smoking during 
pregnancy for 54 low-income and middle-income 
countries using data from Demographic and Health 
Surveys, which were done between 2001 and 2012. 
Nevertheless, most countries do not have up-to-date 
population-level prevalence data on smoking during 
pregnancy, 
and 
the 
global 
prevalence 
is 
there-
fore unknown. Yet knowledge of the prevalence of 
smok 
ing during pregnancy can inform strategies for 
develop 
ing targeted advertising anti-smoking cam-
paigns and intervention programmes. Therefore, to fill 
these knowledge gaps, we did the first comprehensive 
epi 
demiological study to (1) estimate the prevalence of 
smoking (any frequency or quantity) during preg 
nancy 
in the general population, by country, WHO region 
(ie, African Region, Eastern Mediterranean Region, 
European Region, Region of the Americas, Southeast Asian 
Region, and Western Pacific Region), and globally; 
(2) estimate the proportion of pregnant women who 
smoke during pregnancy, by frequency and quantity, on 
a global level; (3) estimate the proportion of women 
who smoke daily and continue to smoke daily during 
pregnancy, by WHO region and globally; and (4) determine 
whether the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy in 
the general population has changed in the past 30 years. 
This study is intended to provide further insight into the 
global burden of smoking during pregnancy and provide 
clinicians and public health authorities with the best 
available data at this time.
Smokeless tobacco was excluded from this study 
because data are scarce, and important potential 
predictors, such as the prevalence of smokeless tobacco 
use in women in all countries, are not available at this 
time.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Smoking during pregnancy is associated with a wide range of 
pregnancy complications and several adverse outcomes for 
the exposed child. Although the detrimental health effects of 
smoking during pregnancy are well established, most 
countries do not have up-to-date population-level prevalence 
data on smoking during pregnancy. To fill these knowledge 
gaps, we did a comprehensive epidemiological study to 
estimate the actual (based on existing empirical studies; for 
43 countries) and predicted (for countries with one or no 
study; 131 countries) prevalence of smoking during 
pregnancy in the general population by country, WHO region, 
and globally. We also estimated the proportion of pregnant 
women globally who smoked during pregnancy, by frequency 
and quantity, and the proportion of women who smoked 
daily and continued to smoke daily during pregnancy, by 
WHO region and globally.
Added value of this study
Globally, 52·9% (95% CI 45·6–60·3) of women who smoked 
daily continued to smoke daily during pregnancy. The 
European Region had the highest estimated prevalence of 
smoking during pregnancy (8·1%, 95% CI 4·0–12·2) but the 
lowest estimated proportion of women who smoked daily and 
continued to smoke daily during pregnancy 
(30·6%, 25·6–36·4). The African Region had the lowest 
estimated prevalence of smoking during pregnancy 
(0·8%, 0·0–2·2) but the second highest estimated proportion 
of women who smoked daily and continued to smoke daily 
during pregnancy (61·9%, 30·6–100·0). The Western Pacific 
Region had the highest proportion of women who smoked 
daily and continued to smoke daily during pregnancy 
(79·6%, 44·2–100·0).
Implications of all the available evidence
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate 
the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy for all countries. 
Although the global prevalence of smoking during pregnancy 
appears to be relatively low (1·7%, 95% CI 0·0–4·5), smoking 
during pregnancy is still prevalent in many countries. 
Knowledge of the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy can 
inform strategies for developing targeted anti-smoking 
campaigns and intervention programmes.

Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.20
Search strategy and selection criteria
A comprehensive systematic literature search was done 
to identify all studies that have reported the prevalence 
of smoking during pregnancy in the general population 
in any country. We searched CINAHL, Embase, ERIC, 
Medline, Medline in process, PsychINFO, Scopus, and 
Web of Science for studies published between Jan 1, 1985, 
and Feb 1, 2016 (ie, a 30-year period), using terms that 
are listed in the appendix (p 4) and without language or 
geographical restrictions. The content pages of the 
major epidemiological journals and citations in the 
relevant articles were also manually screened. The full 
review protocol is available in PROSPERO, registration 
number CRD42017075837
.
Articles were retained if they: consisted of original, 
quantitative research published in a peer-reviewed 
journal; reported the prevalence of smoking during 
pregnancy in the general population; and provided a 
measure of uncertainty (CI or SE) for the prevalence or 
at least two of the following: sample size, number of 
cases, or prevalence. Articles were excluded if they: 
did not include lifetime non-smokers in their sample or 
estimate; used a sample not generalisable to the general 
population of the respective country (ie, studies had to 
use a sample that was generalisable to the general 
population at either the national or subnational level; as 
such, we included nationally or regionally representative 
surveys or hospital-based studies with full coverage of 
births within a specific timeframe); or did not provide 
primary data (ie, estimates had to be based on individual-
level data).
For the purposes of this study, the term smoking refers 
to smoking tobacco in the form of cigarettes. A lifetime 
non-smoker was defined as a woman who had never 
smoked a cigarette. Conversely, a smoker was defined as 
a woman who had smoked at least one cigarette during 
her pregnancy, either daily (at least one cigarette every 
day) or occasionally (at least one cigarette per occasion 
[less than daily]).
We appraised the quality of each included study using 
a modified version of a critical appraisal tool for use in 
systematic reviews addressing questions of prevalence.21
Data analysis
For countries with two or more available empirical 
studies reporting the prevalence of smoking during 
pregnancy, we did country-specific random-effects meta-
analyses.22 Before the meta-analyses, prevalence estim-
ates were transformed using a double arcsine 
trans 
formation23 so that the data followed a normal 
distribution (an assumption needed when statistically 
combining estimates). The resulting combined point 
estimates and respective CI were then back-transformed 
to facilitate interpretation.
For countries with either one or no available study, the 
prevalence (any frequency or quantity) was predicted using 
a multilevel fractional response regression model.24 A 
fractional response model does not rely on any 
distributional assumptions; however, the outcome variable 
must range between zero and one.24 A multilevel approach 
was chosen to account for the likelihood that estimates 
within countries would be more similar to one another 
than would estimates between countries. Additional 
methodological details on the estimation of the prevalence 
of smoking (any frequency or quantity) during pregnancy 
in the general population, by country, are presented in the 
appendix (pp 2, 3).
To estimate the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy 
by WHO region and globally, we calculated a weighted 
average of the country-specific point estimates, weighted 
by the number of livebirths in each country for the latest 
available year (2001–15).25
To estimate the proportion of pregnant women who 
smoked during pregnancy by frequency and quantity on a 
global level, we first did random-effects meta-analyses of 
the frequency and quantity of smoking, using available 
data from all countries. Frequency was categorised as 
either occasional smoking (at least one cigarette per 
occasion, but less than daily) or as daily smoking (at least 
one cigarette every day). Quantity was categorised as either 
light smoking (up to ten cigarettes per smoking day), 
moderate smoking (11–19 cigarettes per smoking day), or 
heavy smoking (≥20 cigarettes per smoking day). We then

applied the estimated proportions of occasional and daily 
smoking (frequency) and light, moderate, and heavy 
smoking (quantity) to the estimated global prevalence 
of smoking during pregnancy. To derive the CI for each 
respective point estimate, we did Monte Carlo simulations,26 
generating 100 000 samples per category, and using the 
2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of the resulting distribution 
as the CI.
To estimate the proportion of daily female smokers in 
the general population who continued to smoke daily 
during pregnancy by WHO region and globally, we first 
calculated a weighted average of the country-specific point 
estimates (data obtained directly from the Institute of 
Health Metrics and Evaluation), weighted by the adult 
female population in each country. We then applied the 
estimated proportion of pregnant women who smoked 
daily to the regional and global estimates of the prevalence 
of smoking during pregnancy. We did Monte Carlo 
simulations to estimate the CI for each estimated 
proportion.
We used a univariate mixed-effects fractional response 
model24 to determine whether the prevalence of smo-
king during pregnancy has changed in the past 30 years. 
Given that most studies came from the USA, we also 
did a sensitivity analysis by removing all studies from 
the USA to determine whether they were driving the 
observed trend.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Of 21 329 studies identified in the literature search, 
295 studies with relevant data were retained for data 
extraction (figure 1; appendix p 5). These 295 empirical 
studies contained 373 estimates from 104 countries on 
the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy, as several 
studies reported estimates of the prevalence of smoking 
during pregnancy for multiple geographies (ie, for more 
than one country or for more than one site within 
a country).18,27–33 Data were available for 32 of 47 countries 
in the African Region, 16 of 35 countries in the 
Region of the Americas, six of 21 countries in the Eastern 
Mediterranean Region, 35 of 53 countries in the European 
Region, six of 11 countries in the Southeast Asian Region, 
and nine of 27 countries in the Western Pacific 
Region. 46 estimates were available for light smoking, 
34 estimates for moderate smoking, and 29 estimates for 
heavy smoking during pregnancy. The prevalence of 
smoking occasionally was reported in 15 studies, whereas 
the prevalence of smoking daily during pregnancy was

reported in 20 studies. The critical appraisal of included 
studies and a complete reference list is available in the 
appendix (p 11, 24).
The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was 
estimated for 147 countries (via meta-analysis for 
43 countries [with two or more available empirical studies] 
and via statistical modelling [prediction] for 131 countries). 
The prevalence of smoking during pregnancy could not be 
estimated for 20 countries because of missing data for one 
or more predictor variables. The final model was based on 
372 of the 373 available estimates (ie, those with complete 
covariate data) from 104 countries and included the 
following predictor variables: age-standardised prevalence 
of daily smoking in women of childbearing age (β=0·80 
[referring to an increase of 10%], 95% CI 0·62–0·97), gross 
domestic product at purchasing price parity (β=–0·08 
[referring to an increase of 10 000 international dollars], 
95% CI –0·21 to 0·05), proportion of the population living 
in urban areas (β=0·35 [referring to a 10% increase], 
95% CI 0·24–0·46), and study year (β=–0·14 [referring to a 
10 year increase], 95% CI –0·30 to 0·01).
The five countries with the highest estimated 
prevalence of smoking (any frequency or quantity) 
during pregnancy were Ireland (38·4%, 95% CI 
25·4–52·4; I²=96·5%, based on meta-analysis of 
five studies), Uruguay (29·7%, 16·6–44·8; based on 
meta-analysis of three studies), Bulgaria (29·4%, 
26·6–32·2; based on statistical modelling), Spain 
(26·0%, 22·4–29·7; I²=96·3%, based on meta-analysis 
of ten studies), and Denmark (25·2%, 18·6–32·4; 
I²=99·8%, based on meta-analysis of six studies). The 
five countries with the lowest prevalence of smoking 
during pregnancy were Tanzania (0·2%, 0·0–0·6; based 
on meta-analysis of two studies), Burundi (0·3%, 0·0–0·6; 
based on statistical modelling), St Lucia (0·3%, 0·0–0·6; 
based on statistical modelling), Sri Lanka (0·3%, 
0·0–0·6; based on statistical modelling), and Malawi 
(0·3%, 0·0–0·7; based on statistical modelling). The 
prevalence of smoking during pregnancy, by country, is 
shown in figure 2 and in the appendix (p 18). The results 
of the tests of heterogeneity and publication bias for the 
meta-analyses of smoking during pregnancy in the 
general population, by country, are shown in the 
appendix (p 21).
The global prevalence of smoking during preg 
nancy 
was estimated to be 1·7% (95% CI 0·0–4·5). The highest 
prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was in the 
European Region (8·1%, 4·0–12·2), and the lowest 
prevalence of smoking during pregnancy was in the 
African Region (0·8%, 0·0–2·2).
Globally, 72·5% (95% CI 70·4–75·0) of women who 
smoked during pregnancy were daily smokers, and 
27·5% (25·4–29·6) were occasional smokers (figure 3). 
In terms of quantity, more than half of all women who 
smoked during pregnancy (51·8%, 95% CI 50·0–53·5) 
were light smokers, 34·8% (33·1–36·4) were moderate 
smokers, and 13·5% (12·3–14·7) were heavy smokers. 
Results of the tests of heterogeneity and publication bias 
for the meta-analyses of frequency and quantity of 
cigarettes smoked during pregnancy in the general 
population, by country, are shown in the appendix (p 22).
The proportion of women who smoked daily and 
continued to smoke daily during pregnancy ranged 
from 30·6% (95% CI 25·6–36·4) in the European Region 
to 79·6% (44·2–100·0) in the Western Pacific Region 
(figure 4). Globally, this proportion was estimated to be 
52·9% (95% CI 45·6–60·3). The estimated regional 
averages of the prevalence of daily smoking in women 
and daily smoking in pregnant women in the general 
population is shown in the appendix (p 23).
The univariate multilevel fractional response model 
showed that the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy 
has significantly decreased in the past 30 years (β=–0·47 
[referring to a 10 year increase], 95% CI –0·56 to –0·39). 
After removing all studies from the USA, the decrease in 
the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy in the past

Discussion
This is the first study to estimate the prevalence of 
smoking during pregnancy nationally, regionally, and 
globally and to estimate the proportion of pregnant 
women globally who smoke during pregnancy by 
frequency and quantity. This is also the first study to 
estimate the proportion of women who smoke daily and 
continue to smoke daily during pregnancy, regionally 
and globally. Although social norms discourage women 
from smoking during pregnanc, our findings show that 
smoking during pregnancy is still a prevalent behaviour 
in many countries. Specifically, the estimated prevalence 
of smoking during pregnancy was more than 10% in 
29 (17%) of 174 countries and more than 20% in 
12 (7%) countries. Our findings also indicate that more 
than 70% of pregnant women who smoked during 
pregnancy did so daily rather than occasionally. This 
finding is in line with previous findings that women 
who quit smoking before pregnancy had smoked fewer 
cigarettes before pregnancy than women who did not 
quit,34 suggesting that daily smokers are less likely to 
quit smoking upon pregnancy recognition. We also 
found that, globally, more than half of women who 
smoked daily continued to do so while they were 
pregnant.
The clinical implications of these findings are note-
worthy, particularly the fact that although the pre-
valence appears to be decreasing overall, smoking 
dur 
ing pregnancy is still prevalent in several countries. 
Obstetricians, gynaecologists, midwives, and other pre-
natal health-care workers in these countries should be 
aware of the magnitude of the problem and promote 
smoking cessation interventions that target pregnancy, 
whether pharmacological, psychological, or both. The 
preconception period is the optimal time to intervene.35 
Thus, preconception prevention strategies need to be 
implemented in countries where the prevalence of 
smoking during pregnancy remains high. The imple-
mentation of such strategies might be particularly 
challenging in low-income and middle-income countries 
because of obstacles such as economic factors, low 
perception of risks in the public, lack of policies that 
promote cessation, poor health-care systems, lack of 
infrastructure, and industry action.36 In low-income and 
middle-income countries where the prevalence of 
smoking during pregnancy is high, the focus should be 
on building capacity by, for example, integrating smoking 
cessation services with other health-care services, train-
ing health-care professionals, and developing guide-
lines.36 WHO-recommended tobacco control policies and 
legislations have increased globally, with the largest 
increases in low-income and middle-income countries. 
However, the negative relation between higher imple-
mentation and management of tobacco control and 
smoking prevalence is stronger in men than in women.37 
In view of the adverse effects of smoking on the 
developing fetus, this relation underscores the importance 
of sex-sensitive prevention initiatives and smoking 
cessation programmes that specifically target women of 
childbearing age.
As such, the prevalence estimates presented here serve 
to inform stakeholders and policy makers of the 
magnitude of the public health problem in their 
respective countries. The predicted prevalence estimates 
of smoking during pregnancy are particularly useful for 
countries where existing tobacco use surveillance 
systems or data are absent. We have therefore provided 
countries with a working estimate of the prevalence of 
smoking during pregnancy, which can be refined when 
data become available.
Women with intended conceptions are more likely 
than women with unintended pregnancies to quit 
smoking upon pregnancy recognition.38 However, a large 
percentage of pregnancies globally are unplanned.39 As 
such, WHO recommends that a five-step process be 
used in all health-care settings to the extent possible.40 
These five steps are: (1) asking about smoking history 
and current smoking behaviour; (2) advising smoking 
women of the value of quitting and the risks of 
continuing; (3) assessing a smoking woman’s motivation 
and thoughts on quitting; (4) assisting the smoker in all 
attempts to quit with the use of materials or referrals to 
intervention programmes; and (5) arranging follow-up 
throughout pregnancy and the post-partum period.41 
Importantly, the primary focus should be on smoking 
cessation. However, if a woman continues to smoke 
while pregnant, she should be supported in reducing the 
quantity of smoking.
A few limitations of our study should be acknowledged. 
First, the pooled prevalence of smoking during 
pregnancy is based on data from the past 30 years. As 
shown in the time–trend analysis, the prevalence of 
smoking during pregnancy decreased with time, which 
could have resulted in a slight inflation of both the 
estimates obtained via meta-analysis and the regional 
and global estimates because they are weighted averages 
of both actual and predicted data. However, the time–
trends of smoking during pregnancy might differ 
between countries, so the predicted estimates for some 
countries in which the prevalence of smoking in women 
increased in the past three decades might be slightly 
underestimated.42 Second, because of the data availability, 
we used age-standardised prevalence of daily smoking in 
women of childbearing age in the statistical model, as 
opposed to the prevalence of smoking at any frequency. 
However, the prevalence of daily smoking could be a 
stronger indicator of smoking during pregnancy. Third, 
it was not possible to obtain country-specific estimates 
of the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy by 
frequency and quantity because of data limitations. 
Instead, these indicators were pooled across countries

and applied to the global prevalence estimate. We 
acknowledge that the estimates of the prevalence of 
smoking during pregnancy by frequency and quantity 
are likely to be biased towards the countries from which 
the data originated; however, these are the best available 
global estimates at this time. Fourth, the predicted 
prevalence estimates for the 131 countries with either 
one or no available study might diverge from the true 
prevalence because the data from which the values were 
predicted carry some measurement error, and other 
relevant explanatory variables might affect the prevalence 
of smoking during pregnancy and not be possible to 
account for. Other valid approaches to predicting 
country-specific 
prevalence 
of 
smoking 
during 
pregnancy exist (eg, a dynamic model) but rely on 
additional information (eg, data on smoking initiation 
and the prevalence of smokers and never-smokers). 
However, taking into consideration the study and that 
we were limited to the information reported in the 
included studies, we consider the present model to yield 
the best estimates possible. Finally, as would be expected 
when pooling estimates across time and locations, we 
observed high heterogeneity in the meta-analyses. 
However, heterogeneity can be overestimated when 
summarising studies with large sample sizes.43
The findings highlight a number of key areas for 
improvement in all parts of the world with respect to 
tobacco use during pregnancy, which includes both 
smoked and smokeless tobacco. First, women of child-
bearing age need to be educated about the potential 
detrimental effects of tobacco use on the developing fetus 
and infant. It is important that the messages about tobacco 
use during pregnancy be provided to women clearly and 
consistently.40 Prenatal care provides an opportune time 
for health-care professionals to ask about tobacco use 
and provide appropriate referrals to smoking cessation 
programmes whenever necessary. Second, evidence-based 
smoking cessation interventions should be integrated into 
routine prenatal care. Third, universal screening protocols 
need to be established for all pregnant women and women 
of childbearing age. Finally, prevention efforts and 
intervention programmes need to be expanded to reach 
the broader population of women of childbearing age.44
