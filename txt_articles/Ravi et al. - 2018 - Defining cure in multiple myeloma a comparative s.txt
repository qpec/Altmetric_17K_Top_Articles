Abstract
Advances in therapy in recent years have led investigators to challenge the dogma that multiple myeloma (MM) is
incurable. We assessed overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of young patients ( ≤ 50 years) with MM and
compared outcomes with follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and Hodgkin lymphoma
(HL). All patients ≤ 50 years with newly diagnosed MM (n = 212), FL (n = 168), DLBCL (n = 195), and HL (n = 233)
between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2015 were included. Observed vs. expected survival was summarized by
standardized mortality ratios (SMR). Compared to the background US population, excess mortality risk was seen at
diagnosis in all four cancers, SMR 19.5 (15.2–24.5) in MM, 4.2 (2.3–7.2) in FL, 13.0 (9.2–18.4) in DLBCL, and 5.2 (2.6–9.3) in
HL. We reasoned that cure would most likely occur in the first 3 years after diagnosis and be reflected by an overall
survival probability similar to the background population. From the 36-month landmark, excess mortality risk was seen
in MM (SMR 20.7 [14.7–28.3]) and FL (SMR 3.8 [1.5–7.8]), but not with DLBCL (SMR 3.1 [0.8–8.0]) or HL (SMR 0.9 [0.0–5.1]).
MM patients have 20-fold excess mortality risk compared to the background population at diagnosis and at 3 years
after diagnosis, suggesting that MM remains an incurable cancer.
Introduction
In 1963, Easson and Russel, writing in the British
Medical Journal, provided the first definition of ‘‘cure’’ in
cancer, noting that it should “connote that in time—
probably a decade or two after treatment—there remains
a group of disease-free survivors whose annual death rate
from all causes is similar to that of a normal population
group of the same sex and age distribution1.” This was
further extended by Frei and Gehan in 1971 to include
that cure should be “unassociated with continuing mor-
bidity from the disease or its treatment”2. The time-
dependent concept of cure was further refined by Frei,
who argued that the particular time point—typically
between 1–5 years in most curable cancers—at which the
plateau in disease-free survival ought to occur (to signify
cure) varies depending on the disease kinetics of a parti-
cular tumor3.
Despite the simplicity of this concept, the use of the
word cure in oncology is heterogeneous, with two thirds
of published manuscripts containing that word in 2012
not meeting the above standard4. A poster child of this
heterogeneity is found in the case of multiple myeloma
(MM), a cancer where there has historically been a clash
of treatment philosophies between disease cure and
control5. In the past decade, the introduction of several
new therapies has been shown to improve survival out-
comes6–9 and there has been increasing adoption of
autologous stem cell transplantation in eligible patients,

 which have both produced higher rates of complete
response (CR)10. This has led investigators to challenge
the traditional dogma that MM is an incurable disease11–
13, and the use of the term ‘‘functional’’ or ‘‘operational
cure’’ has gained traction to denote patients remaining in
CR for a prolonged period of time14,15. However, most
MM patients are on continuous suppressive therapy and
face a persistent risk of relapse with no clear plateau in
progression-free or overall survival (OS) demonstrated on
intent to treat analysis of large clinical trials. Furthermore,
unlike young patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
[DLBCL] and Hodgkin lymphoma [HL], who have a well-
established probability of cure with normal or near-
normal life span after a short (usually < 6 months) course
of therapy, similar newly diagnosed MM patients cannot
be assured of cure or normal life span, despite continuous
or near-continuous therapy.
Based on these considerations, we sought to define
survival outcomes and test the definition of cure in young
( ≤ 50 years) MM patients treated in the contemporary
era, and compare outcomes with similarly aged patients
with three other hematologic malignancies (follicular
lymphoma [FL], DLBCL, and Hodgkin lymphoma [HL]),
the latter two of which are widely considered to be curable
cancers and meet accepted definitions of cure2,16. We
specifically chose a cohort ≤ 50 years of age since this age
group is likely to have few comorbidities, have access to
and be able to tolerate the best possible treatments con-
currently or sequentially, and thereby have the best
opportunity to achieve ‘‘cure’’. Moreover, if the disease is
curable, subsequent mortality in younger persons should
be close to the general population. This eliminates the
problem encountered in a disease affecting predominantly
older adults, like MM, where curability is difficult to test
due to deaths from competing causes.
Methods
Study cohort
The MM cohort comprised all patients under the age of
50 years who were diagnosed with MM between January
1, 2005 and December 31, 2015. Only those who were
seen at our institution within 6 months of diagnosis were
included. Patients in whom there was no information on
follow-up (i.e., only attended for one clinic visit) were
excluded, as well as those who had previously received
anti-myeloma therapy for smoldering MM.
The lymphoma cohort consisted of patients under the
age of 50 years with FL, DLBCL, and HL who enrolled in
the SPORE Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER) at
our institution between January 1, 2005 and June 30, 2015.
Descriptions of the MER cohort have been previously
reported17–20. Briefly, all patients in the MER were
prospectively enrolled within 9 months of diagnosis and
then contacted systematically every 6 months for the first
3 years and then annually. Baseline clinical, laboratory,
and treatment data were abstracted from medical records
by using a standard protocol, and lymphoma diagnosis
was reviewed by an expert hematopathologist. All pro-
gression, re-treatment, and deaths were verified through
review of pathology and medical records.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes of interest were OS and
progression-free survival (PFS). OS was defined as the
duration between date of diagnosis and death, or censored
at the date of last follow-up. PFS in MM was defined as
the duration between initiation of systemic treatment and
disease progression, according to established criteria21. In
the MER, an event-free survival definition (EFS) is utilized
for PFS-style outcomes, due to the observational nature of
the cohort. EFS in the MER is calculated as the time from
diagnosis to progression/relapse, initiation of new therapy
for disease progression or lack of efficacy, and death due
to any cause. For purposes of nomenclature in this study,
we will use PFS to describe the PFS (MM) and EFS (MER)
results going forward. Patients without PFS events were
censored at the date of last known disease status.
Statistical analysis
Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan–Meier
method and the log-rank test used to make comparisons
between groups. Expected survival accounting for age and
sex was generated in R by using the general United States
(survexp.us)
populations
as
the
reference
group22.
Observed vs. expected OS was plotted by using a condi-
tional approach and summarized by using standardized
mortality ratios (SMRs) of observed to expected deaths23.
Median
follow-up
was
calculated
using
reverse
Kaplan–Meier method. All tests were two sided with a p-
value of < 0.05 considered to be significant. Statistical
analysis was performed using SPSS v.22 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, USA) and Rv3.3.1.
Results
The baseline demographics of all patients with MM (n
= 212), FL (n = 168), DLBCL (n = 195), and HL (n = 233)
included in this study are shown in Table 1. The median
ages at diagnosis were 45, 42, 41, and 32 years, respec-
tively. Patients received contemporary treatment regimes,
with 92% of MM patients receiving a novel agent as part
of induction chemotherapy and 52% having a hemato-
poietic stem cell transplant during their disease course.
Median follow-up was 5.8 years (95% confidence interval
[CI] 5.0–6.7) in patients with MM, 5.0 years (4.3–5.8) in

 FL, 4.9 years (4.4–5.4) in DLBCL, and 4.1 years (3.6–4.7)
in HL patients.
Survival outcomes and comparisons with the background
population
Figure 1a–d (left panel) shows OS of patients from the
time of diagnosis and expected survival of the background
population. The 5-year OS was 70.2% (63.7–77.4) in
patients with MM, 93.1% (88.7–87.6) in FL, 80.0%
(73.9–86.6) in DLBCL, and 94.5% (91.4–97.8) in HL. PFS
curves are shown in Fig. 2, with corresponding 5-year PFS
rates of 28.3% (22.0–36.3), 59.1% (51.0–68.5), 69.0%
(62.4–76.3), and 85.0% (80.3–90.0) in patients with MM,
FL, DLBCL, and HL, respectively. OS and PFS curves for
MM patients stratified by ISS are shown in Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1; there were no differences in either median OS
(ISS-1, not reached; ISS-2, 7.8 years; ISS-3, 8.6 years; p =
0.461) or median PFS (ISS-1, 2.9 years; ISS-2, 2.6 years;
ISS-3, 2.3 years; p = 0.586) between ISS sub-groups.
SMRs for patients at diagnosis are shown in Table 2.
When comparing survival to the age- and sex-matched
background population, a significant excess mortality risk
was seen at the time of diagnosis in all four diseases, SMR
19.5 (15.2–24.5) in MM, 4.2 (2.3–7.2) in FL, 13.0
(9.2–18.4) in DLBCL, and 5.2 (2.6–9.3) in HL.
Thirty-six-month landmark analysis
We reasoned that patients would most likely be cured in
the first 3 years after diagnosis and this would be reflected
by an OS probability similar to the matched background
population. Therefore, we performed a landmark analysis
in patients alive 36 months after diagnosis (MM, n = 143;
FL, n = 114; DLBCL, n = 110; HL, n = 140), with OS
curves shown in Fig. 1a–d, right panel. The 3-year OS
rates
(from
the
36-month
landmark)
were
75.6%
(68.1–83.9) in patients with MM, 95.8% (91.9–100.0) in
FL, 95.8% (91.9–100.0) in DLBCL, and 99.2% (97.8–100.0)
in HL.
From the 36-month landmark time point, a significant
excess mortality risk compared to the matched back-
ground population was observed in MM (SMR-36: 20.7
[14.7–28.3]) and FL (SMR-36: 3.8 [1.5–7.8]), but not in
DLBCL (SMR-36: 3.1 [0.8–8.0]) or HL (SMR-36: 0.9
[0.0–5.1], Table 2).
Discussion
Put simply, cure should be viewed as successful delivery
of treatment(s) for a defined period of time with sub-
sequent complete resolution of the disease. The patient
should then expect to be able to enjoy a quantity and
quality of life comparable with healthy counterparts once

 treatment has been completed. Although occasional
patients with almost any disease may meet the definition
of having achieved a cure, the point at which a disease as a
whole can be considered curable requires that a pre-
dictable percentage of patients must achieve this state.
This is best illustrated by the achievement of a plateau in
OS (or disease-free survival) curves that oncologists
appreciate in clearly curable cancers such as pediatric
acute lymphoblastic leukemia or testicular cancer. An
additional requirement for true cure is that the plateau
persists despite therapy having been stopped. For exam-
ple, are hypertension, diabetes, or human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV) infection curable? Does ongoing
molecular and morphologic remission of chronic myeloid
leukemia with continuous imatinib therapy constitute a
cure? If indefinite or lifelong administration of suppres-
sive medication is needed, are we curing or controlling the
disease?
MM is a disease that encapsulates the cure controversy.
It has long been heralded as an incurable cancer. How-
ever, there have been advances in therapy, notably with
autologous24 and allogeneic25 stem cell transplantation in
the 1990s, and with newer immunomodulatory6,7 and
targeted therapy8,9. Many patients are surviving beyond
the 5-year mark that has traditionally been associated with
‘‘cure’’ in several malignancies. These have led some
physicians to propose that MM has become a curable
cancer11. Yet, there are two problems that make it difficult
to determine the curability of diseases like myeloma. First,
the disease affects older people in whom the disease can
be controlled for many years, during which time they can
die of other unrelated causes (competing risks). Thus it is
hard to determine, even among a subset of these patients
who are in CR, whether the disease was truly cured, or if a
relapse would have occurred with time. Second, cure

 requires that therapy is given for a finite period of time,
and demonstration that a proportion of patients remain
free of relapse for a prolonged period of time. In diseases
like MM where continuous therapy is administered, it is,
therefore, difficult to ascertain cure.
In this paper, we studied young patients ( ≤ 50 years of
age) with MM treated in the last 10 years, and compared
their overall and expected survival to patients with FL,
DLBCL, and HL. We show that almost all patients with
HL and DLBCL alive 3 years after diagnosis are essentially
cured—their subsequent survival is similar to the matched
background population and there is an unequivocal pla-
teau in the OS and PFS curves. In contrast, in MM, the 3-
year landmark OS is markedly worse compared to the
general population (Fig. 1), and even among patients who
live many years, there is a relentless risk of relapse (Fig. 2).
Hence, although young patients with MM have a 10-year
OS of nearly 50%, they are typically not being cured.
While there may be an apparent “plateau” in the OS and
PFS curves, the numbers of patients at risk at these time
points are small, and thus we have limited confidence that
this signifies a true plateau.
In 2014, an update of the ‘‘total therapy’’ (TT) trials
conducted at the University of Arkansas reported a ‘‘cure
fraction’’ of almost 50% among all patients treated under
the TT3a protocol11. This number, derived from a
mathematical model, led them to conclude that MM had
joined the “club of curable malignancies”. Although one
cannot fail to be impressed by the Arkansas outcomes,
two points must be appreciated. Firstly, comparison of the
OS and PFS curves for MM with those for HL and DLBCL
highlight that the level of ‘‘cure’’ achieved with MM is not
that which is seen with the latter two cancers. This is
supported by multi-institutional data showing that MM
patients under the age of 50 lose an average of more than
25 years of life compared to healthy population controls26.
Second, the treatment of MM (in our patients and with
TT) incorporates a prolonged period of maintenance
chemotherapy in contrast to HL or DLBCL, where ther-
apy is limited to a defined number of cycles, with no
evidence for a survival benefit arising from adjuvant or
maintenance therapy27. Sustained CR in a subset of
patients with MM enrolled in a very cumbersome clinical
trial receiving years of continuous ongoing therapy is, in
our opinion, not the same as showing a clear plateau in
OS and PFS in patients treated with an intent to cure.
It is arguably true that there are some cancers that are
inherently curable, whereas others are not, at least at the
current time. Typically with the former, there are dis-
coveries or advancements in therapy that produce para-
digm shifts and blaze a trail towards cure. For example,
testicular cancer was generally incurable until the dis-
covery of cisplatin-based chemotherapy28. Similarly, the
advent of MOPP therapy for HL led to a path towards
cure for this and other lymphomas29. The use of cla-
dribine has led to an effective therapy for hairy-cell leu-
kemia30,
while
progressive
advancements
in
chemotherapy and supportive care have produced a cure
for childhood leukemia31. In the case of MM, there have
been several impressive breakthroughs in treatment,
including development of autologous and allogeneic
hematopoietic cell transplantation, novel immunomodu-
latory agents and proteasome inhibitors, which have led to
significant improvement in outcomes over the past two
decades32. Further studies pursuing potentially curative
strategies for early stage or smoldering disease are cur-
rently under way, and results are eagerly awaited12.
However, our results suggest that talk about the disease
being curable (at least in the majority of patients) is
premature.
A major strength of our analysis is that we studied large
cohorts of young patients treated at a major medical
center with access to best available therapy (our 5-year OS
rate of 70% is very similar to the 5-year rate of 74% seen
with TT3a). Other strengths include the contemporary
era of the study, and the sufficient follow-up (up to 10
years) that gave us a reasonable chance at assessing cur-
ability. The comparison of MM with three types of lym-
phoma, two of which are well-established as curable
entities enables a more informed assessment of long-term
survival and curability compared to viewing the disease in
isolation. Finally, the purposeful inclusion of only young
patients ( ≤ 50 years) enabled us to test curability in a
cohort that, a priori, would be expected to have the
greatest chance of being cured and in whom the like-
lihood of dying from other causes would be low.
Nevertheless, there are certain limitations that need to
be acknowledged. First, this was a single-center retro-
spective study from a tertiary referral center, which may
limit the generalizability of the results. Secondly, although
our patients had access to and received the best treat-
ments available in the United States, the regimens used
were heterogeneous. We also did not assess particular
subsets of MM patients (such as those achieving MRD
negativity) in whom the possibility of a cure may exist;
however, we did stratify MM patients by ISS and did not
find that patients with lower stage disease showed a
greater propensity to be cured (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Finally, we were unable to capture downstream effects
from treatment (such as secondary malignancies), which
is an important component of the original cure defini-
tion2, or outcomes beyond 10 years.
In conclusion, we found that survival outcomes for
young patients with MM are strikingly different from
those seen with similarly aged patients with HL and
DLBCL. Young patients who survive 3 years with DLBCL
and HL achieve true cure with an OS similar to the
background population. In contrast, patients with MM

 and FL continue to relapse over time, with a significantly
inferior OS to the background population. As the old
adage goes, a picture is worth a thousand words: Figs. 1
and 2 illustrate how OS and PFS curves of curable dis-
eases (DLBCL and HL) look like in a population that has
the best chance of being cured and with a low probability
of dying from other causes. Readers and investigators can
determine for themselves if MM (or FL) appear to be
curable diseases. We are confident that when we see cure,
we will know it.
