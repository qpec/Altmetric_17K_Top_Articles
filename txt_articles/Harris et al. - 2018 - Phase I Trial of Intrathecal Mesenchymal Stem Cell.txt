Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous sys-
tem and is one of the leading causes of disability in young adults. Cell therapy is emerging as a therapeutic strat-
egy to promote repair and regeneration in patients with disability associated with progressive MS.
Methods: We conducted a phase I open-label clinical trial investigating the safety and tolerability of autologous
bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived neural progenitor (MSC-NP) treatment in 20 patients with pro-
gressive MS. MSC-NPs were administered intrathecally (IT) in three separate doses of up to 1 × 107 cells per
dose, spaced three months apart. The primary endpoint was to assess safety and tolerability of the treatment. Ex-
panded disability status scale (EDSS), timed 25-ft walk (T25FW), muscle strength, and urodynamic testing were
used to evaluate treatment response. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01933802.
Findings: IT MSC-NP treatment was safe and well tolerated. The 20 enrolled subjects completed all 60 planned
treatments without serious adverse effects. Minor adverse events included transient fever and mild headaches
usually resolving in b24 h. Post-treatment disability score analysis demonstrated improved median EDSS sug-
gesting possible efficacy. Positive trends were more frequently observed in the subset of SPMS patients and in
ambulatory subjects (EDSS ≤ 6.5). In addition, 70% and 50% of the subjects demonstrated improved muscle
strength and bladder function, respectively, following IT MSC-NP treatment.
Interpretation: The possible reversal of disability that was observed in a subset of patients warrants a larger phase
II placebo-controlled study to establish efficacy of IT MSC-NP treatment in patients with MS.

1. Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating dis-
ease of the central nervous system (CNS). Although the cause of the MS
is unknown, the disease is characterized pathologically by early acute
lesions made up of discrete areas of inflammatory demyelination that
either resolve by remyelination or evolve into chronic lesions with asso-
ciated axonal loss, oligodendroglial cell loss and glial scarring. Lesions of
inflammatory demyelination may be visualized by MRI imaging of the
CNS. Clinically, most patients have disease onset in young adulthood
with characteristic symptom relapses and remissions (RRMS). Over
time, RRMS may evolve to a secondary progressive (SPMS) phase with
accrual of permanent disability. In about 10–15% of patients the disease
course is primarily progressive from onset (PPMS). Available disease
modifying therapies may prevent or delay disease progression through
immunosuppression and immunomodulation (Comi et al., 2017). Once
progressive disability is established, however, there are no therapies
currently available to protect, repair, or regenerate neural tissue in
order to restore neurological function (Ontaneda et al., 2017). Common
clinical manifestations of patients with SPMS or PPMS include motor
weakness with progressive paralysis, sensory dysfunction, bladder/
bowel dysfunction, coordination difficulties and cognitive decline.
Cell-based therapies are currently under investigation to alleviate
some of these clinical symptoms as a strategy to target progressive de-
cline, which remains a major unmet need in MS.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) extracted from various tissues in-
cluding bone marrow have multipotent mesodermal differentiation po-
tential, but more importantly have demonstrated ability to promote
tissue repair through the release of paracrine factors (Meirelles Lda et
al., 2009). Intravenous administration of MSCs or conditioned media
derived from MSCs is protective against experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice through immunomodulatory mecha-
nisms (Bai et al., 2012; Payne et al., 2013; Rafei et al., 2009; Rajan et
al., 2016; Zappia et al., 2005), thus forming the preclinical basis for

 clinical safety testing of intravenous (Cohen et al., 2017; Connick et al.,
2012; Llufriu et al., 2014) or intrathecal (Karussis et al., 2010;
Mohyeddin Bonab et al., 2007; Yamout et al., 2010) transplantation of
autologous MSCs in patients with MS. MSCs are also capable of neuro-
protection, promotion of oligodendrogenesis, and inhibition of gliosis,
and thus may impact multiple aspects of MS pathology in the CNS
(Chen et al., 2001; Li et al., 2005; Rivera et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2011;
Steffenhagen et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2006).
MSC-derived neural progenitors (MSC-NPs) are a subpopulation of
MSCs that exhibit neuroectodermal lineage characteristics with reduced
capacity to undergo mesodermal differentiation (Fu et al., 2008; Harris
et al., 2012a; Harris et al., 2012b; Hermann et al., 2004; Mareschi et
al., 2006). These properties are theorized to minimize the risk of ectopic
differentiation after CNS transplantation (Grigoriadis et al., 2011). Sim-
ilar to MSCs MSC-NPs exhibit immunoregulatory and trophic properties
both in vitro and in vivo along with upregulation of candidate trophic
factors including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Harris et al., 2012b;
Harris et al., 2012a; Cristofanilli et al., 2011). Intrathecal (IT) delivery
of MSC-NPs during the chronic phase of EAE resulted in neurological re-
covery associated with increased spinal cord myelination decreased im-
mune infiltration in the CNS and increased recruitment of endogenous
progenitor cells (Harris et al., 2012b). Importantly multiple doses rather
than a single dose were necessary to demonstrate improvement in neu-
rological function (Harris et al., 2012b)
The clinical feasibility of IT MSC-NP treatment in MS was initially in-
vestigated in six patients with advanced MS treated with two to five in-
jections of escalating doses of autologous MSC-NPs (Harris et al., 2016).
Patients were followed an average of 7.4 years after initial injection.
There were no serious adverse events or safety concerns noted, and
the treatments were well-tolerated (Harris et al., 2016). Four of the six
patients showed a measurable clinical improvement following MSC-
NP treatment. Based on these pre-clinical and early clinical studies, we
initiated an open-label phase I trial using IT autologous MSC-NPs to es-
tablish safety and tolerability and to determine efficacy trends in 20 pa-
tients with progressive MS. The outcomes of this study support the
overall safety and tolerability of this therapeutic approach, in addition
to revealing possible evidence of efficacy.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Design and Oversight
The study was an open-label, single-arm, phase I clinical trial to eval-
uate safety and tolerability of repeated IT administration of autologous
MSC-NPs in 20 patients with progressive MS (Fig. 1). All study activities
were conducted at the Tisch MS Research Center of New York. The study
was conducted as an FDA investigational new drug, and is registered
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01933802. The study was approved
by Western Institutional Review Board and was conducted in accor-
dance with the Helsinki Declaration. All patients gave written informed
consent. An independent external data and safety monitoring board
evaluated all safety data.
The treatment phase of the study consisted of three separate IT injec-
tions of up to 1 × 107 autologous MSC-NPs spaced three months apart.
The dose and dosing schedule were based on a preclinical study in
mouse EAE, as well as observed safety and tolerability in an early clinical
dose escalation study (Harris et al., 2016; Harris et al., 2012b). All pa-
tients were assessed on the day of treatment, and one day, one week,

 and one month following each dose. Post-treatment assessments oc-
curred three and six months following the third dose. Long-term safety
assessment was scheduled 24 months following the third dose. Al-
though the study was not blinded, all treatments were administered
by a single neurologist, and all assessments by a separate neurologist.
Eligible patients had clinically definite SPMS or PPMS with signifi-
cant disability (EDSS ≥ 3.0) that was not acquired within the 12 months
prior to enrollment. The inclusion of patients with a relatively stable dis-
ease state was designed to allow better discernment between natural
disease progression and treatment-related events. Disease stability
was determined by less than a 1.0 point change in EDSS in the 12
months preceding entry into the treatment phase of the study, and
lack of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on an MRI and by a stable MRI dis-
ease burden (number and size of T2 lesions) over the same period. Ex-
clusion criteria included patients with cognitive impairment (as
determined by mini-mental and PASAT testing), which might impact
fully informed consent, and with existing comorbidities such as cancer
history that might complicate safety outcomes of the experimental
treatment. To minimize additional variables, patients who were already
receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMT) upon entering the study
continued as a concomitant treatment through the course of the study
(Table 1). In subjects receiving concomitant intrathecal methotrexate
(IT-MTX), methotrexate and MSC-NPs were administered at least four
weeks apart to minimize any effects of this treatment on the cells.
2.2. Clinical Assessments
All study subjects underwent baseline exams that included EDSS,
T25FW, nine-hole peg test, paced auditory serial addition test
(PASAT), multiple sclerosis quality of life questionnaire, physical
exam, neurological exam, and headache pain scale. Additional safety
testing was performed as suggested by the FDA. Follow-up exams and
neurological assessments were conducted at a pre-designated fre-
quency after each dose in order to assess adverse events, and three
and six months after the third dose to compare with pre-treatment
baseline. The numerical headache pain scale from 0 (no pain at all) to
10 (pain as bad as it can be) was completed pre-treatment, and 24 h,
3 days, 5 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month following each treatment.
Headaches were classified as “mild” for pain rated between 0 and 3,
“moderate” for pain rated between 4 and 7, and “severe” for pain
rated between 8 and 10.
Brain MRI scans with and without gadolinium enhancement were
performed at baseline, two months after the first dose, and three
months after the third dose to assess safety and document any change.
All scans were read by visual inspection by independent neuro-radiolo-
gists who were blinded to the sequence of MRIs in relation to treatment.
Changes in T2 lesion burden, T1 black holes, brain volume, and gadolin-
ium-enhancing lesions were documented.
To address bladder function, a pertinent history of symptoms was
taken and any use of medications affecting bladder function was
noted. All subjects underwent urodynamic testing at baseline and
three months after the third dose. All urodynamic testing was per-
formed in the same laboratory and results interpreted by a single
neuro-urologist. The following parameters were recorded: PVR,
cystometry with simultaneous measurements of bladder, urethral and
subtracted rectal pressures for first sensation, maximum bladder capac-
ity, urethral pressure profile with functional length measurement and
maximum closing pressure. Bladder pressure was assessed with filling
and sphincter relaxation and synergic voiding assessed. Urinary peak
flow rate was also measured.
Muscle strength was graded by a single neurologist using Medical
Research Council (MRC) scale as follows: 0, no contraction (plegic); 1,
trace of contraction; 2, active movement, gravity eliminated; 3, active
movement against gravity; 4, active movement against gravity and re-
sistance; 5, normal strength (Medical Research Council, 2000). Muscles
that were scored included deltoid, biceps brachii, triceps, wrist exten-
sors, digit extensors and flexors in the upper limb and iliopsoas, hip ab-
ductors/adductors, quadriceps, hamstrings, ankle dorsi and planter
flexors, and toe flexors and extensors in the lower limbs. Marked im-
provement was defined as improvement in multiple muscle groups
and increased muscle function. Moderate improvement defined as in-
creased strength in at least one muscle with functional change. Mild im-
provement defined as increased strength in at least one muscle without
functional change.

 (cGMP)-compliant process in a clean-room facility at the Tisch MS Re-
search Center of New York. As previously described (Harris et al.,
2012a; Harris et al., 2016), MSCs were isolated based on plastic adher-
ence from the mononucleated cell fraction from a 20 ml sternal bone
marrow aspirate, and expanded ex vivo in MSC growth medium
(Lonza) supplemented with 2 mM GlutaMAX™I CTS™ (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and 10% double-filtered autologous serum collected from
peripheral blood of each study participant. Cells were incubated in a hu-
midified 37 °C incubator at 5% CO2 and 5% O2. MSCs were cryopreserved
after two and three passages, generating a stock of cells sufficient for
multiple subsequent expansions. For each treatment, a portion of
MSCs were thawed, expanded for two to three more passages, then cul-
tured for two to three weeks in neural progenitor maintenance medium
(Lonza) supplemented with 20 ng/ml each of epidermal growth factor
(EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to generate neural pro-
genitors (MSC-NPs). Just prior to the injection, MSC-NPs were collected,
washed, counted, and resuspended in preservative-free saline for im-
mediate intrathecal administration. The target cell number was be-
tween 5 × 106 and 1 × 107 cells. The maximum dose of 1 × 107 cells
per treatment was not always attained due to the individual growth
characteristics of each batch of MSC-NPs (Table 1).
Quality and safety testing was conducted at multiple steps during
MSC-NP manufacturing to ensure quality, sterility and batch-to-batch
consistency. Bone marrow-derived MSCs were tested for MSC charac-
teristics including growth, morphology, cell surface expression
(CD105+/CD73+/CD90+/CD45−/CD34−/CD14−/CD20−/HLA-DR−),
and in vitro osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential as de-
termined by alizarin red or Oil Red O positivity, respectively, as de-
scribed previously (Harris et al., 2012a). After each MSC expansion,
chromosome analysis was performed on a minimum of 20 DAPI-banded
metaphases and all metaphases were fully karyotyped (Molecular Cyto-
genetics Core Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center). MSC-
NPs generated from MSCs were assessed based on neurosphere mor-
phology, cell number, and cell viability by trypan blue. Sterility was
assessed by qPCR with Microbial DNA qPCR Assays Pan Bacteria 3 and
Pan Aspergillus/Candida (Qiagen) using DNA extracted from MSC-NP
conditioned media. Final product sterility was confirmed by gram
stain and by 14-day liquid culture.
Confirmation of neural lineage differentiation of MSC-NPs was per-
formed by TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
as previously described (Harris et al., 2012a) to confirm neural lineage
gene upregulation of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)

(Hs00183533_m1) and relative quantification was determined by
delta delta Ct analysis of MSC-NPs compared to the MSCs using RQ Man-
ager software (Applied Biosystems). Final product testing specified N2-
fold up- or down-regulation of at least 4 of the 6 genes on the panel for
product release. Additional gene targets analyzed included hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) (Assay ID: Hs00300159_m1), nestin (NES)
(Assay ID: Hs00707120_s1), neurofilament medium (NEFM) (Assay
ID: Hs00193572_m1), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Assay
ID: Hs00909238_g1).
2.4. Treatment Procedure
Injections of autologous cell suspensions were performed intrathe-
cally via standard lumbar puncture at the L3-L4 level using a 24 gauge
non-traumatic spinal needle. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (3–5 ml) was
withdrawn, and MSC-NPs were resuspended in 2 ml of sterile saline
and injected into the intrathecal space, followed by a flush of 2 ml of sa-
line. In eight of the subjects, cells were administered intrathecally via
the in-dwelling access port of their implanted baclofen pump. For all
IT-MSC-NP treatments, prophylactic IV infusion of antibiotics (80 mg
of tobramycin and 500 mg of vancomycin) was co-administered to min-
imize any risk of meningitis. Tobramycin or vancomycin had no effect
on MSC-NP cell viability or proliferation in vitro (data not shown).
2.5. Statistical Analysis
The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was used to compare median EDSS
from baseline (at the time of the first dose) to the final time point 6
months post-3rd dose. The Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to assess
the change from baseline to 6 months between ambulatory patients
(baseline EDSS ≤ 6.5) and non-ambulatory patients (baseline EDSS ≥
7.0). The Fisher's exact test was used to assess the association between
EDSS improvement (i.e. at least a 0.5 point decrease in EDSS or more at
six months post-treatment vs. no change or increase in EDSS) and base-
line ambulatory status, as well as the association between EDSS im-
provement and disease subtype (i.e., SPMS vs. PPMS). All p-values are
two-sided with statistical significance evaluated at the 0.05 alpha
level. Statistical analysis was performed in R Version 3.3.1 (R Core
Team, Vienna, Austria).
3. Results
Demographics of the 20 study subjects are shown in Table 1. The
study cohort had a mean EDSS of 6.8 (range 3.5 to 8.5) and mean disease
duration of 18.8 years (range 10–32 years). Only six of the twenty pa-
tients were male and 80% of the patients had SPMS. Half of the study
subjects were non-ambulatory at the time of enrollment (EDSS ≥ 7.0),
eight subjects required assistance for ambulation (EDSS 6.0 to 6.5),
and two subjects were able to ambulate without assistance (EDSS 3.5
to 5.5). There were no significant associations observed between ambu-
latory status and patient demographics (age, gender, disease subtype, or
disease duration).
The primary objective of the phase I study was to test safety and tol-
erability of autologous MSC-NPs administered intrathecally in MS pa-
tients. MSC-NPs were administered every three months for a total of
three doses of up to 1 × 107 cells per dose. Variation in the final dose,
which averaged 9.4 × 106 cells (range 5.3 × 106 to 1 × 107 cells) was de-
pendent on the individual growth characteristics of each batch of MSC-
NPs (Table 1). There was no correlation between the number of cells ad-
ministered or cell viability with age or disease type. All patients received
the target dose range of five to ten million cells, and 70% received the
maximum dose. Each batch of MSC-NPs was confirmed to have neural
lineage characteristics prior to injection (Supplementary Fig. 1).
There were no serious adverse events or hospitalizations associated
with IT MSC-NP treatment (Table 2). Specifically, we did not observe
any cases of chemical or infectious meningitis. The most frequently

 observed minor adverse events consisted of transient headaches and
fever occurring within 24 h after the treatment in 17 out of 20 patients
(85%). Of the 60 total treatments, the majority (34/60, or 57%) were as-
sociated with mild to moderate headaches, and 15% (9/60) were associ-
ated with severe headaches. All headaches resolved within 1 week after
over-the-counter treatment with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen,
or no treatment. The exception was subject #17 who experienced head-
ache of mild to moderate severity that persisted for one month that was
determined to be a consequence of the lumbar puncture procedure (spi-
nal headache). In addition, 5 patients experienced low-grade fever
(below 100 °F) 24 h after treatment that resolved in all cases within
48 h without any treatment. Overall, fever was associated with 9 out
of 60 treatments (15%). The incidence of headache or fever did not differ
among the 3 IT administrations. Upon specific questioning, none of the
adverse events were severe enough for any study subject to choose to
discontinue participation in the trial.
The safety data was further supported by a lack of any change in
brain MRI scans during the study. Specifically, no new T2 lesions or
changes in disease burden were observed. These data demonstrate
that multiple IT administration of MSC-NPs was well tolerated and
was associated with short-term safety.
The study design finalized with FDA guidance was not blinded, and
there were no placebo controls. All study subjects were monitored for
changes in clinical status. The primary post-treatment clinical assess-
ments were conducted at three and six months following the third
treatment and compared to baseline (pre-treatment) in order to deter-
mine trends in efficacy. Of the 20 study subjects, 15 (or 75%) demon-
strated neurological improvement associated with IT MSC-NP
treatment. Improvements were documented in the following areas:
EDSS, MRC muscle strength scale, timed 25-ft walk (T25FW), and/or
bladder function. Of the remaining subjects, two showed disease wors-
ening despite the treatment, and three subjects showed no change.
Muscle strength testing by MRC muscle strength scale showed that
14 of the 20 subjects (70%) showed objective increase in muscle
strength (Table 3) with most of the subjects (13 out of 14) demonstrat-
ing improvement in lower limb (LL) strength. Only one of the 14 pa-
tients had increased strength limited to the upper limbs (UL). In
addition to greater muscle strength, four out of the ten ambulatory sub-
jects showed a N20% improvement in T25FW speed compared to pre-
treatment baseline (Table 4). Two additional study subjects (#11 and
#12) who were non-ambulatory at baseline were able to perform the
walk test post-treatment, albeit with bilateral use of assistive devices.
EDSS was assessed every three months starting at baseline, at the
time of second and third dosing, and three and six months post third
dose (Fig. 2). Overall, there was a decrease in median EDSS from 6.8 at
baseline to 6.5 six months post-third treatment (p = .058). It was nota-
ble that the minimum EDSS score was lower at the final time-point
(minimum EDSS of 1.5) than at baseline (minimum EDSS of 3.5). Eight
study subjects (40%) demonstrated at least a 0.5 point improvement
in EDSS six months post-treatment, with four of the eight subjects
showing an improvement of 2.0 or greater positive change compared
to baseline. Ten study subjects showed continued stable EDSS through-
out the course of treatment, and two study subjects had evidence of dis-
ease progression as determined by a decline in EDSS. There was a
statistically non-significant change in EDSS score from baseline to six
months post-treatment in subjects who were ambulatory at baseline
(median difference 0.5 (0.0;2.0)) compared to non-ambulatory patients
(median difference 0.0 (0.0;0.0)) (p = .097). Similarly, a higher propor-
tion of ambulatory patients (60%) had an EDSS improvement of 0.5 or
more compared to non-ambulatory patients (20%) (p = .170). There
was also a statistically non-significant trend for a higher percentage of
improvement (≥0.5 on EDSS vs. no improvement) in SPMS patients
(50%) compared to patients with PPMS (0%) (p = .117).
To determine whether bladder function was affected by IT MSC-NP
treatment, we conducted urodynamic testing in all study subjects at
baseline and three months post-third treatment, in addition to taking
a urinary function history and noting use of bladder medications. One
subject had normal bladder function at baseline, and a second subject
neglected to complete baseline urodynamics so they were not included
in the bladder function analysis. Of the remaining 18 study subjects,
nine subjects (50%) demonstrated either
symptomatic and/or
urodynamic improvement in bladder function post treatment (Table
5). Improvement was evident either by a N20% improvement in bladder
capacity at three-month follow-up compared to baseline, and/or by dis-
continuation of bladder medication and documented improvement in
bladder function upon questioning. We hypothesize that improvement
of bladder function may reflect MSC-NP-mediated repair and regenera-
tion in spinal cord areas proximal to the area of injection.
As intact cognition function was a requirement to participate in this
study, we did not observe any changes on PASAT testing. There were no
efficacy trends in upper limb function as determined by the nine-hole
peg test, although one patient who could not perform the test pre-treat-
ment showed measurable improvement in the non-dominant limb

(Supplementary Table 2).
4. Discussion
This single center, open-label phase I study in patients with MS
shows that repeated administration of intrathecally-injected bone mar-
row derived MSC-NPs is safe and well tolerated. Consistent with previ-
ous reports, intrathecal cell therapy is associated with transient
headaches and mild febrile reactions in the immediate post-injection
period (Bonab et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2016; Karussis et al., 2010;
Mohyeddin Bonab et al., 2007). Importantly, there were no serious
adverse events associated with this treatment. Despite having the op-
tion to discontinue treatment at will, all 20 of the study subjects toler-
ated and completed the 60 planned treatments.
Although this open-label single arm study was not designed to es-
tablish efficacy, we report our observations. Improvement of
established disability was seen in 40% of patients as assessed by a de-
crease in post-treatment EDSS scores compared to baseline. This possi-
ble efficacious therapeutic effect is confounded by a lack of comparator
placebo arm. However, improvement was also observed in muscle
strength testing in at least one muscle group in 70% of patients, which
was associated with improved ambulatory speed and less measurable
disability in 40% of all patients. Consistent with our previous observa-
tions (Harris et al., 2016), post-treatment improvements in bladder
function were observed in 50% of study subjects as determined by de-
creased symptomology, decreased medication use or improved
urodynamic values. These efficacy trends were particularly encouraging
given that the patient selection was not particularly suited to determine
efficacy as the majority of patients had advanced disability (mean EDSS
at baseline was 6.8) and had long-standing disease (mean disease dura-
tion over 18 years). Statistical trends in the data suggest that the thera-
peutic response to IT MSC-NP treatment may be most evident in
ambulatory patients who have SPMS, in contrast to those who are
non-ambulatory or who have PPMS. However, we acknowledge that

 the open-label study design of this phase I trial was not primarily setup
to determine efficacy but to ensure safety. The overriding safety con-
cerns with the use of multiple IT cell injections, including the possible
development of acute hydrocephalus by the infusion of IT cells or risk
of tumor development, resulted in close initial monitoring and a stag-
gered initial treatment of patients. Despite the shortcomings of the effi-
cacy assessments, our positive results are noteworthy for a phase I study
in a population of advanced MS patients, and potentially represent a
new therapeutic option for MS patients with established disability.
A number of key factors may have contributed to our observations
using IT MSC-NP treatment. First, the experimental design included
multiple rather than single dosing of MSC-NPs, as a result of our previ-
ous work in the EAE animal model of MS (Harris et al., 2012b). Likewise,
in other neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), multiple dosing of intrathecal MSCs has been incorporated into
early phase I/II study designs as supported by pre-clinical models (Oh
et al., 2015; Staff et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2009a). Based on the proposed
trophic mechanism of action of MSC-NPs, we hypothesize that multiple
doses of cells may be necessary for the sustained production of immu-
nomodulatory and trophic factors in order to exceed a therapeutic
threshold (Harris et al., 2012b; Zhang et al., 2009a). We found that
MSC-NPs express and secrete a number of trophic factors including
HGF, GDNF, IGF, and LIF (Harris et al., 2012a), all of which have been
shown previously to mediate various aspects of neural repair including
recruitment of endogenous progenitors (Bai et al., 2012; Deverman and
Patterson, 2012; Huang and Dreyfus, 2016; Zhang et al., 2009b; Zhao et
al., 2008). In addition, the release of immunomodulatory factors by in-
trathecally transplanted MSC-NPs may specifically target the compart-
mentalized inflammation such as astrocyte and microglial activation
characteristic of progressive MS (Mahad et al., 2015).
Another important aspect of this study was the use of the intrathecal
route of administration for cell delivery. Although intravenous adminis-
tration of bone marrow MSCs was capable of suppressing EAE through
immunomodulatory mechanisms, it has not been established that a suf-
ficient number of cells cross the blood-brain barrier to directly impact
reparative mechanisms in the CNS (Abramowski et al., 2016; Gerdoni
et al., 2007; Kassis et al., 2008). Indeed, early clinical trials testing intra-
venous autologous MSCs have shown limited therapeutic benefit in MS
(Cohen et al., 2017; Connick et al., 2012; Llufriu et al., 2014). Because
physical disability in MS is likely a manifestation of spinal cord disease,
the IT route of administration maximizes the therapeutic potential for
effect in the spinal cord. The safety and feasibility of this approach is
supported by initial open-label clinical studies investigating autologous
MSCs or MSC-NPs in MS administered via the IT route (Bonab et al.,
2012; Harris et al., 2016; Karussis et al., 2010; Mohyeddin Bonab et al.,
2007; Yamout et al., 2010). Although some side effects associated with
meningeal irritation were initially reported, particularly in one patient
who received a very high cell dose (Yamout et al., 2010), IT cell delivery
is generally well tolerated. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, MSC-
NPs were freshly harvested from cell culture and immediately adminis-
tered to the patient, thus addressing a recent concern regarding im-
paired therapeutic functionality of cryopreserved cells thawed at
bedside (Francois et al., 2012; Moll et al., 2014).
In conclusion, this study shows that intrathecal therapy with MSC-
NPs is safe and well tolerated in patients with MS. Improvement of neu-
rological disability was noted in a number of patients. These findings
have led to the initiation of a FDA-approved randomized, placebo con-
trolled and blinded phase II study in a larger group of patients to deter-
mine efficacy.
