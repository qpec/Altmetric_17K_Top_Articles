Abstract
Purpose: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) required that private
insurance plans allow clinical trial participation and cover stan-
dard-of-care costs, but the impact of this provision has not been
well-characterized. We assessed rates of insurance clearance for
trial participation within our large early-phase clinical trials
program, before and after implementation of the requirement.
Experimental Design: We analyzed the departmental database
fortheClinicalCenterforTargeted Therapy (CCTT)at MDAnderson
Cancer Center (Houston, TX). Among patients referred for spon-
sored trials, we described rates of insurance clearance and prolonged
time to clearance (at least 14 days) from July 2012 to June 2013
(baseline), July 2013–December 2013 (following CCTT staffing
changes in July 2103), and January 2014–June 2015 (following
implementation of the ACA). We used multivariable logistic regres-
sion models to compare rates across these time periods.
Results: We identified 2,404 referrals for insurance clearance.
Among privately insured patients, insurance clearance rates were
higher for those referred from January 2014 to June 2015 than for
those referred from July 2012 to June 2013 (OR, 4.72; 95% CI,
2.96–7.51). There was no association between referral period and
clearance rates for Medicare/Medicaid patients (P ¼ 0.25). Refer-
ral from January 2014 to June 2015 was associated with lower
rates of prolonged clearance among both privately insured
(OR 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38–0.86) and Medicare/Medicaid patients
(OR 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19–0.83).
Conclusions: Within our large early-phase clinical trials
program, insurance clearance rates among privately insured
patients improved following implementation of the ACA's
requirement for coverage of standard-of-care costs. Clin Cancer

Introduction
Historically, less than 5% of patients with cancer in the United
States have enrolled in clinical trials (1–4). Older patients, racial
and ethnic minorities, and patients with lower incomes are less
likely to discuss the option of participating in a trial and to enroll
in one (4–6). However, clinical trials are essential to the devel-
opment of new treatments for cancer, and phase I studies in
particular have become increasingly important as the number of
candidate targeted therapies and immunotherapies under study
has increased (7).
In addition to the cost of a new therapy under consideration
within the context of a clinical trial, participants may incur
additional costs, related to care such as required office visits,
imaging, or laboratory work. Nevertheless, prior studies have
demonstrated that the total cost of treating a patient on a
clinical trial may be, at most, modestly higher than that of
treating a patient off of a trial protocol (8, 9). Since 2000,
Medicare has explicitly covered the routine costs of clinical
trials with therapeutic intent (10). By 2003, 19 states had
passed laws mandating that private insurance plans provide
coverage for routine medical care for patients participating in
cancer clinical trials (11). As of 2006, 20 states had such laws,
and insurers in three more states had agreed to voluntarily
cover costs associated with clinical trials (12). Texas passed
such a law in 2009 (13, 14).
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of
2010 was the first federal law to mandate that group health
plans and state-licensed insurance issuers provide coverage of
standard-of-care
medical
costs
for
patients
enrolled
in
approved clinical trials, effective January 1, 2014. In this con-
text, "approved" trials are those approved or funded by the NCI,
CDC, CMS, Department of Defense/VA, cooperative group or
center affiliated with those entities, or the Department of
Energy, and must be conducted under an investigational new
drug application or be exempt from such an application (15).
Nevertheless, several factors mitigate the potential impact of
the law. For example, patients may effectively be excluded from
clinical trial coverage if their care networks do not include an
institution conducting a trial, and such terms as "standard of
care costs" eligible for coverage remain vague (16). In addition,
the ACA requirement for coverage of routine care on clinical

 trials excluded "grandfathered" plans in existence before March
23, 2010, unless those plans subsequently reduced benefits or
increased premiums (17). Furthermore, the ACA requirement
did not extend to state Medicaid plans (18), and Medicaid
coverage for routine care costs in cancer clinical trials is
required only in some states; Texas is among those states that
now has such a requirement (13, 17). Finally, recent political
shifts have called the future of the ACA itself into question.
Despite this changing legal landscape, the impact of insurance
denials on patient enrollment in clinical trials has not been well
characterized. One study of patients with cancer who consented to
clinical trials from 2003 to 2008 at a large comprehensive cancer
center found that 13.6% of patients were denied coverage for
clinical trial participation. None of those patients were then
treated on a therapeutic trial (19).
Our specific aim in this analysis was to describe our program's
experience with insurance clearance for clinical trial enrollment,
and rates of prolonged time to insurance clearance, before and
after implementation of the ACA's requirement for coverage of
standard-of-care costs. We assessed patients evaluated by the
early-phase clinical trials program at the University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center from July 2012 to June 2015.
Materials and Methods
Study design
The MD Anderson Department of Investigational Cancer Ther-
apeutics (ICT), and its associated clinic, the Clinical Center for
Targeted Therapy (CCTT), were established in 2004. The purpose
of the unit is to conduct novel phase I and phase II oncology
clinical trials in a centralized unit within MD Anderson Cancer
Center (Houston, TX). In 2015, the CCTT evaluated over 3,000
patients and enrolled nearly 1,500 patients on over 150 active
oncology clinical trials.
We identified patients evaluated by the CCTT from July 2012
through June 2015 and deemed clinically eligible for partici-
pation in a clinical trial. The CCTT maintains a database of all
such patients and tracks rates of successful insurance clearance,
time to clearance, and whether the clinical trial includes drug(s)
provided by a pharmaceutical company. To focus on cases in
which only fully standard-of-care costs would have been sub-
mitted to patients' insurance and prevent confounding related
to shifts in our clinical trials portfolio over time, we restricted
the analysis to patients being considered for sponsored trials,
defined as those in which an investigational agent would have
been provided free of charge. Patients who were considered for
more than one clinical trial at different time points were
included in the database more than once. We linked these data
to the MD Anderson tumor registry for additional information
on patient demographics and to the institutional clinical data-
base for information on insurance coverage at the time of
referral to the CCTT.
Participants
Patients were included if they were residents of one of the 50
states in the United States or the District of Columbia, had
entries in the CCTT database that could be linked to insurance
and cancer registry information, were diagnosed with only one
primary tumor according to the registry, and had commercial
insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid. International, self-pay, and
charity care patients were therefore excluded. Patients were
also excluded if they did not have clear documentation of
insurance clearance status within the CCTT database (Fig. 1).
This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki; it was approved by the Institutional Review Board
at MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX), and the
requirement for informed consent in this retrospective analysis
was waived.
Outcome variables
Our primary outcomes were (i) the rate of insurance clearance
for clinical trial participation and (ii) prolonged time (greater
than or equal to 14 days) to clearance among referrals that were
cleared. Both were treated as binary variables. For referrals in
which there was clear documentation of insurance clearance
status but not time to clearance, cases were included in analyses
of the former but not the latter outcome.
Independent variables
Our principal independent variables of interest were type of
insurance (private insurance only, or any Medicare/Medicaid
coverage) and month of referral. Month of referral was divided
into three categories (July 2012–June 2013, July 2013–Decem-
ber 2013, and January 2014–June 2015), because staffing
changes within the CCTT in July 2013 led to increased pre-
screening of patients for clinical trial coverage before they were
ever considered for a clinical appointment, and the ACA's
requirement for coverage of the standard-of-care costs of clinical
trials participation took effect in January 2014. We also mea-
sured the demographic characteristics of the cohort, including
age, gender, race/ethnicity, and marital status, and residency in
Texas. We tested an additional independent variable represent-
ing whether patients resided in states with clinical trials coverage
requirements enacted before the ACA, specifically in the context
of phase I trials (12, 14).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, ver-
sion 9.4. Unadjusted analyses were performed using Fisher
exact test; when multiple levels of a categorical variable were
present, a Monte Carlo simulation of the Fisher exact test
(100,000 repetitions) was used. Proportions of referrals with
insurance clearance or prolonged time to clearance were repre-
sented

Translational Relevance
Before the ACA, legal requirements for coverage of the
standard-of-care costs of clinical trials for privately insured
patients were heterogeneous and varied by state. The ACA
required coverage of these costs for all privately insured
patients enrolled in approved clinical trials. We analyzed the
experience of our large early-phase clinical trials program with
insurance approval for clinical trials before and after the ACA
was implemented; we found that approval rates for privately
insured patients increased after implementation, but that rates
of prolonged clearance trended similarly for both privately
insured patients and those with government insurance. These
results will inform assessment of the impact of the ACA on
cancer research.

 intervals. Primary analyses were performed using multivariable
logistic regression models. As individual patients could be
referred for insurance clearance and therefore entered in the
CCTT database for more than one clinical trial, we also per-
formed sensitivity analyses using generalized linear mixed
effects models to account for repeated measures among
patients; results were very similar, and we present only the
ordinary logistic regression models here. We performed a
second sensitivity analysis including only the first referral for
each patient; results were again similar, and are presented in

 Results
Study cohort
The demographics of our study cohort are detailed in Table
1. The ACA requirement for insurance coverage of the stan-
dard-of-care costs of clinical trial participation took effect in
January 2014; within our cohort of 2404 referrals, 24%
occurred between July 2012 and June 2013, 14% occurred
between July 2013 and December 2013, and 62% occurred
between January 2014 and June 2015. Sixty percent corre-
sponded to residents of Texas. An additional 8% of referrals
corresponded to patients residing in other states with pre-
existing requirements for coverage of phase I clinical trial costs
before the ACA.
Rates of clearance and prolonged time to clearance
Overall, insurance clearance for clinical trial participation was
accomplished for 95% of referrals. The clearance rates ranged
from 85% among privately insured patients referred from July
2012 to June 2013, to 99% among patients with government
insurance referred from July 2013 to December 2013 (Fig. 2).
Among cleared referrals, the median time to clearance was 3 days,
and the rate of prolonged time to clearance (14 days or greater)
was 10.5%; the rates of prolonged time to clearance ranged from
3% among Medicare/Medicaid patients from January 2014 to
June 2015, to 25% for privately insured patients in July 2013–
December 2013 (Fig. 3).
In unadjusted analyses, there was statistically significant vari-
ation in the probability of insurance clearance according to
age (P ¼ 0.006), type of insurance (P < 0.001), time period
(P < 0.001), and residency in Texas (P ¼ 0.01), although the
extent of the variation was small (range within each of these

 groups, 90%–98%). Among the 40% of referrals correspond-
ing to patients residing in states other than Texas, there was no
significant variation in the probability of insurance clearance
according to whether those states had requirements for clinical
trials coverage before the ACA (P ¼ 1.0). There was no asso-
ciation between insurance clearance and gender, race/ethnicity,
or marital status (Table 1).
Similarly, there was variation in the outcome of prolonged
time to clearance according to age (P < 0.001), insurance type
(P < 0.001), time period (P < 0.001), and residency in Texas
(0.004), but not according to gender, race/ethnicity, or marital
status. Among non-Texas residents, there was no association
between prolonged time to clearance and residency in a state
with a pre-ACA clinical trials coverage requirement (P ¼ 0.49;
Table 2).
Rate of clearance: multivariable models. In an initial multivariable
model, age was not statistically significantly associated with
clearance (P ¼ 0.29) after adjustment for insurance type; there-
fore, age was not included in subsequent models. In another
preliminary multivariable logistic regression model assessing
the rate of insurance clearance, there was a statistically signif-
icant interaction between time period and private insurance
coverage (P < 0.001), indicating that the association between
time period and insurance clearance was different for privately
insured patients than for patients with any Medicare or Med-
icaid coverage. There was no interaction between private insur-
ance coverage and residency in Texas (P ¼ 0.60), or between
time period and residency in Texas (P ¼ 0.86). Therefore, we ran
subsequent models separately for privately insured patients
versus patients with any Medicare or Medicaid coverage, and
included, as independent variables, time period and residency
in Texas.
Among privately insured patients, those referred for clearance
from January 2014 to June 2015 were more likely to be cleared
than those referred from July 2012 to June 2013 [OR, 4.72; 95%
confidence interval (CI), 2.96–7.51; P < 0.001]. Those referred
from July 2013 to December 2013 were also more likely to be
cleared than those referred from July 2012 to June 2013 (OR, 1.92;
95% CI, 1.08–3.41; P ¼ 0.03; Table 3). Patients residing outside of
Texas were less likely to be cleared (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38–0.88;
P ¼ 0.01; Table 3).
Among patients with any Medicare or Medicaid coverage, there
was no significant association between referral time period and
insurance clearance rate (P ¼ 0.25 for the combined hypothesis
test across all three levels of the time period variable). There was
also no association between residency in Texas and the proba-
bility of clearance (P ¼ 0.46 for patients with government
insurance; Table 3).
Prolonged time to clearance: multivariable models. Among referrals
with successful insurance clearance, age was again not associated
with prolonged time to clearance (P ¼ 0.32) after adjustment for
insurance type, so it was not included in subsequent models. For
this outcome, there was no interaction between period of referral
and either type of insurance coverage (P ¼ 0.28) or residency in
Texas (P ¼ 0.08) with respect to the outcome of prolonged time to
clearance. However, to facilitate interpretation of the data and

 comparison with the analyses of rates of clearance, we again ran
separate models for privately insured patients and those with any
government insurance.
Among privately insured patients, referral during the January
2014–June 2015 time period was associated with a lower rate of
prolonged time to clearance than referral from July 2012 to
June 2013 (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38–0.86; P ¼ 0.007). Referral
from July 2013 to December 2013 was associated with a slightly
higher rate of prolonged time to clearance than referral from
July 2012 to June 2013 (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.89–2.49), but this
association did not reach statistical significance (P ¼ 0.13).
There was no association between residency in Texas and
prolonged time to clearance (P ¼ 0.14; Table 3).
Similarly, among patients with any Medicare/Medicaid cover-
age, referral from January 2014 to June 2015 was associated with a
lower rate of prolonged time to clearance compared to referral
from July 2012 to June 2013 (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19–0.83), but
there was no significant association between referral from July
2013 to December 2013 and prolonged time to clearance
(OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.94–4.25). Residency outside of Texas was
associated with a higher probability of prolonged time to clear-
ance (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.29–4.32, P ¼ 0.006; Table 3).
Discussion
The ACA's requirement that private health insurance plans
cover the standard-of-care costs of clinical trial participation has
the potential to increase access to clinical trials for patients with
cancer. However, the future of the ACA itself has become an open
question, such that assessment of the impact of its various
provisions is increasingly important for subsequent policymak-
ing. To assess the early potential impact of the clinical trial
coverage requirement, we analyzed the rate of successful insur-
ance clearance for clinical trial participation within the large early-
phase clinical trials program at our institution. Overall, the rates of
insurance clearance were high throughout our time periods of
interest, and the rates of prolonged time to clearance were fairly
low. Still, we found that, for privately insured patients, clearance
rates were higher during the 18 months following implementa-
tion of the ACA's coverage requirement than they were during the
reference period ending 6 months before implementation. For
patients with Medicare or Medicaid, there was no clear change in
successful insurance clearance following the ACA. The rates of
prolonged time to insurance clearance were lower following
implementation of the ACA in both the privately insured cohort
and the Medicare/Medicaid groups than they were in the reference
period. Residency in Texas was associated with slightly higher
clearance rates and lower prolonged time to clearance, possibly
due to some combination of Texas' clinical trials requirement
passed in 2009 and smoother logistics in dealing with in-state
insurers.
It is therefore possible that the ACA clinical trial coverage
requirement may be facilitating insurance clearance for clinical
trials participation among privately insured patients at our insti-
tution. Many states, including Texas, also enacted clinical trials
coverage requirements before the ACA was implemented. How-
ever, the ACA contained the first national requirement for clinical
trials coverage in private plans, which may have directly affected
out-of-state patients seen at our center and introduced a regula-
tory consistency with the potential to facilitate approval for all
patients. It is worth noting that, from a payor's perspective, even in

NOTE: Results were generated using multivariable logistic regression models. Each row represents one model, for example, one model was fit to data from 1,430
patients with "private only" insurance for clearance analysis. Independent variables were time period (T1, T2, or T3) and residency in Texas (no/yes). Clearance ORs
greater than 1 indicate that clearance rates increased in the corresponding column compared with the reference group. Prolonged clearance ORs less than 1 indicate
that the proportion of patients with prolonged clearance times (>14 days) was lower in the corresponding column.

 cases where treatment on an individual clinical trial might be
more expensive, a trial's ability to determine which treatments are
most valuable can also ultimately be useful to insurers as well as to
patients.
The major limitation of our single-institution analysis is our
inability to fully account for secular trends within the early-phase
clinical trial program. A larger study would likely require either a
concerted and specific effort among institutions, or collaboration
with insurers, who would likely have the most reliable institution-
independent information on all requests for coverage of costs
associated with clinical trials, whether confirmed or denied. We
assessed only referrals for sponsored trials, in which insurers
would not be asked to pay for the cost of a trial drug, to prevent
confounding related to a simultaneous shift in portfolio over time
away from investigator-initiated trials. Still, the administration of
the program underwent a leadership change in July 2013, at which
time, efforts to streamline operations included increased prescre-
ening of patients for clinical trial coverage prior to an initial
clinical evaluation and entry in the database. The ACA's coverage
provision took effect in January 2014, such that these data cannot
determine whether improvements occurring after January 2014
were due to the ACA or to evolving effects of that earlier leadership
change. In addition, the number of employees working on clinical
trial insurance clearance increased from six to 10 in September
2013, and we could not adjust for this staffing change, due to its
collinearity with the primary time period independent variable.
Nevertheless, since the department's clinical volume was also
increasing substantially during that time in the context of a shift
in focus toward industry-sponsored trials, the ratio of staff to
referrals for clearance remained relatively stable.
For the outcome of the rate of insurance clearance for trials,
improvements were seen in the privately insured population
but not in the population with governmental insurance. This
implies a temporal effect specific to the privately insured
population, as would be expected of an effect of the ACA's
coverage requirement; Medicare already had a clinical trial
coverage requirement before the ACA, and the coverage require-
ment did not extend to Medicaid plans. However, this specific
effect was not seen in the outcome of prolonged time to
clearance; it remains possible that secular trends within the
department specifically improved rates of clearance among the
privately insured population, and because the privately insured
population had lower clearance rates at the beginning of our
assessment period, it had more room to improve, regardless of
the mechanism.
In addition, this analysis focused on the issue of clearance for
clinical trials among patients whose insurance allowed access to
our institution in the first place. Recently, concerns have arisen
about the breadth of provider networks available particularly
within exchange networks under the ACA, and about the impact
of narrow networks on access to high-quality cancer care (20–23).
We could not assess the impact of exclusion of our institution
from provider networks on the ability of interested patients to
enroll in clinical trials in the phase I program. Finally, the ACA's
requirement for coverage of clinical trial costs did not extend to
"grandfathered" plans that existed before the ACA and have not
subsequently changed their premium or benefit structures (17),
and we could not assess how often patients had private plans with
that status.
In conclusion, within the large early-phase clinical trials pro-
gram at our institution, we found that rates of successful insurance
clearance for clinical trial enrollment among privately insured
patients have increased following implementation of the clinical
trials coverage requirement for private plans under the ACA. Rates
of prolonged time to insurance clearance have decreased follow-
ing implementation of the requirement, although this change
occurred among both privately insured patients and patients with
government insurance. If validated in other settings, these results
will provide context for subsequent efforts to increase overall
clinical trial participation within the context of an evolving health
care system.
