ntroduction: Information about continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use in the UK is limited. We conducted an online survey of a 
representative sample of current CGM users in England, Scotland and Wales to address this deficit. Methods: The 29-item online survey 
was conducted between 29 December 2016 and 25 January 2017. Persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and caregivers of T1D children/
adolescents were recruited from mailing lists, using Nielsen and Harris Polling databases. Results: 315 patients and caregivers responded to 
the survey – 170 adult patients and 145 caregivers. Among respondents, 144 received full funding for CGM use, 72 received partial funding 
and 83 received no funding. Most reported improvements in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (67.0%), fewer hypoglycaemia episodes (70.2%), 
improved hypoglycaemia awareness (77.5%) and better diabetes management (92.4%). Self-funders reported significantly higher CGM use 
(76.1%) than those who were fully funded (58.9%) and/or partially funded (65.9%), p=0.0008. Fewer than 50% of all respondents reported 
receiving guidance in interpreting CGM data from their diabetes care team; 30.1% of self-funders reported receiving no CGM support from 
their diabetes team compared with fully funded (2.8%) and partially funded (1.4%) respondents, p<0.0001. Conclusions: Patients with T1D 
and their caregivers are realising benefits from CGM use but are largely unsupported by the UK healthcare system.

It is well known that optimising glycaemic control reduces the development and/or progression 
of microvascular and macrovascular disease in type 1 diabetes (T1D).1,2 Unfortunately, a 
significant percentage of individuals with diabetes are not achieving their recommended glycated 
haemoglobin (HbA1c) goals.3 Although achieving and maintaining optimal glycaemic levels through 
self-management remains a challenge for all individuals with T1D, regardless of geographic 
location, the quality of care and support patients receive is also a factor, which appears to differ 
from country to country. 
It is estimated that up to 74% of adults with T1D in the UK have HbA1c levels >7.5%,4 which is in 
stark contrast to other Western countries. A comparison of glycaemic control between countries 
showed notable differences in median HbA1c levels in the UK, US and Germany among adults 
aged ≥25 years3 (Figure 1A). Similar differences in glycaemic control are observed among 
children/adolescents <18 years enrolled in the UK National Paediatric Diabetes Audit (NPDA), 
the US T1D Exchange (T1DX) and the Austrian/German Prospective Diabetes Follow-up Registry 
(DPV)5 (Figure 1B). 
The past decade has seen significant advancements in diabetes management tools and 
technologies that have been demonstrated to improve glycaemic control in individuals with 
T1D. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) is one such tool. Numerous studies have 
shown that use of rtCGM confers significant benefits on individuals with T1D using the technology, 
including improvements in HbA1c and reductions in the occurrence of severe hypoglycaemia and/
or duration of hypoglycaemia.6–22 
Although the majority of previous studies have been conducted among patients who use CGM in 
conjunction with insulin pump therapy,6–11 recent randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that 
patients using multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) can safely use CGM to reduce HbA1c, reduce 
hypoglycaemia and replace fingerstick testing for routine diabetes care decisions.21–26 Regardless 
of the method of insulin delivery, the benefit of CGM is primarily seen in patients who regularly use 
their devices at least 70% of the time.6,12,21,22
Use of CGM has increased significantly in the US, particularly over the last 4 years,27 but adoption of 
this technology has been relatively slow in Europe due to lack of reimbursement, lack of awareness 
regarding the benefits of CGM and/or pursuit of cost containment. However, in 2016 German

insurance payers decided to provide coverage for CGM use for all patients 
using intensive insulin therapy.28 While firm data on the increased adoption 
of CGM in Germany remain to be reported, anecdotal evidence suggests 
that there have been significant increases in the number of patients 
benefitting from improved access. Improving access to CGM has been the 
recent target of new programmes in Scotland and Australia.29,30 Although 
these programmes are not yet mature enough to be assessed, patients 
and patient advocacy organisations welcomed these developments. Yet 
the future of CGM utilisation in the UK continues to be uncertain. 
Although current clinical guidelines from the UK National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend use of CGM in specific 
situations (Table 1), there is no mandate that funding must be provided, 
even if a patient meets the NICE clinical criteria for CGM. NICE believes 
that the evidence demonstrating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness 
of CGM use is insufficient to recommend routine use of CGM in either 
adults or children with T1D.31,32 
Our understanding of the potential benefit of CGM in the UK is limited, as 
reliable data about the actual incidence of CGM use in the UK are scarce. 
To address this information deficit, in late 2016 Dexcom commissioned 
the Nielsen Company to conduct an online survey of a representative 
sample of current CGM users in England, Scotland and Wales. We report 
findings from the survey and present a rationale for expanding access 
to CGM within the UK T1D population. Our goal is to help individuals 
with diabetes obtain access to the tools they need to more effectively 
manage their diabetes.  
Online survey of continuous glucose monitoring 
use in the UK
Design 
The 29-item online survey was conducted between 29 December 2016 
and 25 January 2017. Patients with T1D or caregivers of children with 
T1D (aged <18 years) were recruited from mailing lists, using Nielsen and 
Harris Polling databases. 
The objectives were to: assess respondents’ satisfaction and goals with 
using rtCGM; evaluate the support they receive from their diabetes care 
team; elucidate the impact of their funding source on overall CGM usage; 
and to identify inequalities among CGM users versus the general UK 
population. 
Respondents 
A total of 315 patients and patient caregivers across the UK responded to 
the survey: Scotland (n=25), Northern England (n=70), Midlands/Eastern 
England (n=65), London (n=86), Southern England (n=56) and Wales 
(n=13). Among the respondents were 170 patients aged ≥18 and 145 
caregivers of patients with T1D aged <18.
Average duration of CGM usage was 3 years. Slightly more respondents 
reported treatment with insulin pump therapy (n=178) compared with 
MDI (n=137). Almost half of all respondents received full National Health 
Service (NHS) funding for their CGM device (n=144) regardless of their 
method of insulin delivery (Table 2). More respondents (n=232, 73.7%) 
used a Dexcom CGM system (G4 or G5) (Dexcom, San Diego, CA, US) than 
a Medtronic Enlite® CGM system (Medtronic, Northridge, CA, US) (n=82, 
26.0%); one respondent reported use of another system, which was 
not identified. Users of the FreeStyle LibreTM Flash Glucose Monitoring 
system (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, US) were excluded from the 
survey, as this device does not offer alerts/alarms as recommended by 
NICE guidelines.

Continuous glucose monitoring: adults 
1.6.21 Do not offer real-time continuous glucose monitoring routinely to adults 
with type 1 diabetes. [new 2015]
1.6.22 Consider real-time continuous glucose monitoring for adults with type 
1 diabetes who are willing to commit to using it at least 70% of the time and to 
calibrate it as needed, and who have any of the following despite optimised use 
of insulin therapy and conventional blood glucose monitoring:
• More than one episode a year of severe hypoglycaemia with no obviously 
preventable precipitating cause.
• Complete loss of awareness of hypoglycaemia.
• Frequent (more than two episodes a week) asymptomatic hypoglycaemia 
that is causing problems with daily activities.
• Extreme fear of hypoglycaemia.
• Hyperglycaemia (HbA1c level of 75 mmol/mol [9%] or higher) that persists 
despite testing at least 10 times a day (see recommendations 1.6.11 and 
1.6.12). Continue real-time continuous glucose monitoring only if HbA1c can 
be sustained at or below 53 mmol/mol (7%) and/or there has been a fall in 
HbA1c of 27 mmol/mol (2.5%) or more. [new 2015]
1.6.23 For adults with type 1 diabetes who are having real-time continuous 
glucose monitoring, use the principles of flexible insulin therapy with either 
a multiple daily injection insulin regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin 
infusion (CSII or insulin pump) therapy. [new 2015]
1.6.24 Real-time continuous glucose monitoring should be provided by a centre 
with expertise in its use, as part of strategies to optimise a person’s HbA1c 
levels and reduce the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes. [new 2015] 
Continuous glucose monitoring: children/adolescents 
1.2.62 Offer ongoing real-time continuous glucose monitoring with alarms to 
children and young people with type 1 diabetes who have:
• frequent severe hypoglycaemia or
• impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia associated with adverse 
consequences (for example, seizures or anxiety) or
• inability to recognise, or communicate about, symptoms of hypoglycaemia 
(for example, because of cognitive or neurological disabilities). [new 2015]
1.2.63 Consider ongoing real-time continuous glucose monitoring for:
• neonates, infants and pre-school children
• children and young people who undertake high levels of physical activity (for 
example, sport at a regional, national or international level)
• children and young people who have comorbidities (for example anorexia 
nervosa) or who are receiving treatments (for example corticosteroids) that 
can make blood glucose control difficult. [new 2015]
1.2.64 Consider intermittent (real-time or retrospective) continuous glucose 
monitoring to help improve blood glucose control in children and young people 
who continue to have hyperglycaemia despite insulin adjustment and additional 
support. [new 2015]

Statistical analysis
The mean CGM usage (% time) was calculated for the various subgroups 
in the survey. Where usage was a continuous variable (i.e., mean usage), 
comparisons were made using an analysis of variance (ANOVA), or using 
a t-test when the number of groups was equal to 2. Frequency tables 
were generated and the proportions of factor levels were tested using 
Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests.      
Findings
Perceived value of continuous glucose monitoring
As shown in Table 3, the majority of patients and caregivers felt that 
their key expectations of CGM were mostly realised. Most respondents 
reported improvements in HbA1c, fewer hypoglycaemia episodes, 
improved hypoglycaemia awareness and better overall management of 
their diabetes. Importantly, the majority of respondents reported that the 
value of CGM outweighs the cost. There were no statistically significant 
differences in the perceived value of CGM among respondents, 
regardless of funding source.
Continuous glucose monitoring usage
Average CGM usage was found to vary by funding source, method of 
insulin delivery and brand of CGM device (Table 4). Self-funders reported 
using their CGM 76.1% of days per month. This was significantly higher 
(p=0.0008) than those who were fully funded (58.9%) and/or partially 
funded. The percentage of usage was significantly higher among insulin 
pump users compared with MDI-treated respondents. The proportion 
of CGM usage time was significantly higher among Dexcom CGM users 
compared with Medtronic CGM users. 
A significantly higher percentage of Dexcom CGM users (62.1%) reported 
wearing their device >70% of the time compared with Medtronic CGM 
users (37.8%), p=0.0001. Among respondents treated with insulin pump 
therapy, the percentage of CGM usage (>70% of the time) was significantly 
higher among Dexcom users (77.7%) compared with Medtronic users 
(53.9%), p<0.0001. A similar difference in percentage of CGM usage was 
observed in Dexcom versus Medtronic users treated with MDI: 61.2% 
versus 50.2%, respectively, p=0.09.
Diabetes team support
A funding effect was observed in respondents’ perceptions of the support 
they receive from the diabetes care team.  
A significantly higher percentage 
of fully funded (94.4%) and partially funded (91.7%) respondents indicated 
satisfaction with their diabetes care team compared with self funded 
(80.7%) respondents (p=0.0035). Approximately 51% of caregivers 
reported that their child’s diabetes team could be doing more to help 
them manage their child’s diabetes. Confidence in the diabetes care 
team’s advice was significantly higher among fully funded (85.4%) and 
partially funded respondents (94.4%) respondents compared with that 
among self-funded (71.1%) respondents (p=0.0003). 
Notable, but not statistically significant differences in diabetes team 
support regarding CGM use were also observed (Table 5). A smaller 
percentage of self-funders reported that their team assisted them in 
interpreting their CGM data on a regular basis compared with fully funded 
and partially funded respondents. A significantly lower percentage of self 
funded respondents reported receiving guidance in how to use their CGM 
devices compared with fully funded and partially funded respondents. 
A significantly higher percentage of self-funders reported receiving no 
CGM support from their diabetes team compared with fully funded and 
partially funded respondents. 
Funding assistance
Only 23 (27.7%) self-funders reported that their team applied for CGM 
funding. Among the 57 self-funders who requested that their team apply 
for funding, 23 (41.8%) reported that their team was unwilling to apply; 
15 (27.3%) were told they were ineligible for funding, 15 (27.3%) were told 
that there is no NHS funding available and four (7.3%) reported that their 
team never provided a reason for not applying for funding.   
Discussion  
This is the first survey to assess whether and how T1D patients and 
caregivers are benefitting from CGM in the UK. The survey results 
suggest that UK patients are realising tangible benefits from their CGM 
use, which are similar to those seen in other countries. Most of those

 Is Continuous Glucose Monitoring Underappreciated in the UK?

EUROPEAN ENDOCRINOLOGY
surveyed agree that CGM use increases confidence, enables better 
management of diabetes, greatly improves quality of life, and that the 
value outweighs the cost. However, our findings indicate that the level 
of support received by patients and caregivers using CGM in the UK is 
suboptimal. Approximately half of all respondents indicated that their 
diabetes care team could be doing more to help manage diabetes; 
approximately 40% feel they do not get enough support in using CGM. 
Moreover, self-funders are less likely to: be satisfied with their diabetes 
care team relationship; feel their team understands their needs; and feel 
confident in the team’s advice. These views of their diabetes care teams 
stand in contrast to their reported belief that CGM technology is helping 
them improve their diabetes control. These data also suggest that only 
half of the people using CGM are getting support with interpretation and 
disease management even when their CGM is fully funded.  
An interesting finding was the notable difference in both preference and 
frequency of use between the Dexcom and Medtronic CGM systems. 
Despite greater accuracy and reliability among all current CGM systems, 
differences in performance between the current manufacturers remain. 
These differences can influence frequency of use and user perceptions 
of accuracy and utility. 
Polonsky and Hessler reported that satisfaction with device performance 
was an independent predictor of perceived control over diabetes 
 
and hypoglycaemia.35 The same data set showed that satisfaction 
with performance was also associated with more frequent CGM use, 
perceptions of device usefulness in avoiding hypoglycaemia and 
hyperglycaemia and in achieving better overall glycaemic control.36 
In 2013, Chamberlain et al. reported results from a survey of 87 CGM users 
(n=40, Dexcom; n=47 Medtronic) to explore whether their frequency of 
sensor use was related to CGM technology, in general, or to differences 
among currently available CGM systems.37 Survey results showed that 
76% of Dexcom users reported wearing their devices ‘almost daily’, 
compared with 19% of Medtronic users. Differences in the accuracy of 
the CGM systems used by respondents in our survey may explain the 
differences in preference and frequency of use.
Although diabetes outcomes measures can be influenced by several 
factors, significant discrepancies exist in glycaemic control between 
the UK and other countries (Figure 1). However, the survey findings 
demonstrate marked inequalities within the UK in terms of who receives 
funding for CGM and the support they receive from their diabetes care 
team. For example, although approximately 40% of the UK population 
has an annual household income of <£25,000,33,38 only 19% of survey 
respondents reported income in this bracket. Additionally, whereas 
60% of respondents reported having a university-level education, 
only approximately 41% of adults in the UK have earned a tertiary 
qualification.39 Because the survey included a representative sample 
of the UK population, the income and educational disparities between 
survey respondents and the general public suggest that access to CGM 
use may be disproportionately greater among those with higher income 
and better education. However, these disparities may only partially 
explain the relatively low adoption of CGM in the UK; geographic location 
may also play a major role in access. 
In 2013, the NHS replaced Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) with Clinical 
Commissioning Groups (CCGs), which are responsible for the planning 
and commissioning of healthcare services for their local area. While 
some CCGs have pioneered pathways for CGM access,40 others have not. 
Regardless of their clinical need, a patient’s diabetes care team cannot 
access CGM funding if the patient’s local CCG considers them ineligible. 
This situation is often referred to as ‘postcode prescribing’. This may 
explain why over 30% of survey respondents who have insulin pump 
funding must self fund their CGM use (Table 2). 
Another important finding from the survey is the lack of support for 
patients regarding CGM use, which suggests that the current lack of a 
coherent CGM funding policy in the UK has conditioned healthcare 
providers’ willingness and ability, to assist patients in obtaining funding and 
provide clinical assistance to CGM users. As reported, a large percentage 
of respondents stated they receive little or no support in interpreting 
and utilising their CGM data, especially self-funders, who are motivated 
to optimise their diabetes control. Moreover, the notable percentage of 
respondents who reported that their diabetes care team refused to apply 
for funding may reflect a lack of awareness of the pathways that exist 
and/or an inability to identify patients who could benefit from CGM use. 
Self-selection of respondents may be considered a limitation of our 
survey. However, because participants were recruited from the Nielsen 
databases, we believe bias was likely minimal. Additionally, although 
the sample size (n=315) was robust, it likely represents only a small 
portion of CGM users in the UK. Nevertheless, this is the first survey to 
query CGM users about their perceptions, response to treatment and 
challenges in obtaining support from their diabetes care team, drawing 
upon the experience of both caregivers of T1D children/adolescents and 
adult CGM users across the UK.  
The current situation regarding CGM funding and support in the UK in 
some ways parallels the experiences of many patients who tried to obtain 
funding for an insulin pump prior to the first NICE Technology Appraisal on 
insulin pump therapy.41 As reported earlier by White and colleagues,42 the 
prevalence of insulin pump use in the UK remains below the expectation 
of NICE and usage rates of other Western countries, and this may be due, 
in part, to lack of adequate training among healthcare providers. 
The NHS was created out of the ideal that ‘good healthcare should be 
available to all, regardless of wealth’.43 It has faced many challenges since 
its inception in 1948 and the current difficulties in accessing diabetes 
technology represent one more barrier to be addressed. Changes in 
training, attitude and prioritisation of healthcare resources are needed. 
Continuing to restrict and deny patient access to CGM and the support 
to use it optimally is both detrimental to patients and ‘unhealthy’ for the 
healthcare system.
