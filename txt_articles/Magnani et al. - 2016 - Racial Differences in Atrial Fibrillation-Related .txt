 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
(ARIC) Study is a prospective, observational cohort. From 1987 through 1989, the ARIC Study 
enrolled 15 792 men and women and conducted 4 follow-up examinations (2011–2013) with 
active surveillance for vital status and hospitalizations. Race was determined by self-report and 
categorized as white, black, or other.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Atrial fibrillation (adjudicated using 
electrocardiograms, hospital discharge codes, and death certificates), stroke, heart failure, CHD, 
and mortality.
RESULTS—After exclusions, 15 080 participants (mean [SD] age, 54.2 [5.8] years; 8290 women 
[55.5%]; 3831 black individuals [25.4%]) were included in this analysis. During a mean (SD) 
follow-up of 20.6 (6.2) years, there were 2348 cases of incident AF. The incident rates of AF per 
1000 person-years were 8.1 (95%CI, 7.7–8.5) in white individuals and 5.8 (95%CI, 5.2–6.3) in 
black individuals. The rates of stroke, heart failure, CHD, and mortality were higher in black 
individuals with AF than white individuals with AF. The association of AF with these outcomes, 
estimated with rate differences (rate of the end point in those with AF minus the rate in those 
without AF per 1000 person-years), also differed by race. The rate difference for stroke in 
individuals with AF was 10.2 (95%CI, 6.6–13.9) in white individuals and 21.4 (95%CI, 10.2–
32.6) in black individuals. For heart failure and CHD, the rate differences were 1.5- to 2.0-fold 
higher in black individuals than white individuals. White individuals with AF had a rate difference 
of 55.9 (95%CI, 48.1–63.7) for mortality compared with black individuals, who had a rate 
difference of 106.0 (95%CI, 86.0–125.9).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—In the prospective ARIC Study, the outcome of AF on 
the rates of stroke, heart failure, CHD, and mortality was considerably larger in black individuals 
than white individuals. These results indicate the vulnerability and increased risk in black 
individuals with AF. Continued investigation of racial differences in AF and its related adverse 
outcomes are essential to identify and mitigate racial disparities in the treatment of AF.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia with significant adverse outcomes 
and high social and medical costs.1 In the United States, AF affects approximately 1% of the 
adult population and more than 5% of those 65 years and older.2,3 Atrial fibrillation has been 
associated with increased risks of stroke by 5.0-fold, heart failure by 3.0-fold, and mortality 
by 2.0-fold.4–7 The study of AF and its associated clinical adverse outcomes has been 
conducted predominantly in cohorts with participants of mostly white race.
Several factors contribute to the more limited study of AF in racially or ethnically diverse 
cohorts compared with white cohorts. Multiple health care registries, databases, and 
community-based studies8–14 have identified differences in the prevalence of AF by race, 
such that reports8–14 have consistently identified AF as being less prevalent in racial and 
ethnic minorities. In addition, it is well established that ethnic and racial minorities have less 
participation and recruitment in cardiovascular studies and trials compared with white 
individuals.15 The deficit of minority participation in clinical studies extends to AF because 
many landmark trials in AF have not reported or had limited enrollment of ethnic or racial 
minorities.16 However, alongside the established racial differences in AF prevalence are

 critical differences in the treatments to prevent outcomes associated with AF, particularly 
stroke.11,17–19
Estimating the relations of AF to adverse outcomes in nonwhite cohorts has evident public 
health relevance. Observational cohorts may identify racial differences. Understanding such 
differences may guide interventions to address and mitigate disparities. To improve our 
understanding of the morbidity associated with AF in black individuals, we examined data 
from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study,20 a large, mostly biracial, 
community-based cohort. Specifically, we evaluated and compared the race-specific 
associations of AF with stroke, heart failure, coronary heart disease (CHD), and mortality 
between white and black individuals in this cohort.
Methods
Study Sample
The ARIC Study is a community-based cohort designed to investigate determinants of 
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease in the general population. Detailed methods have 
been published elsewhere.20 Briefly, from 1987 through 1989, a total of 15 792 men and 
women aged 45 to 64 years were recruited from 4 communities in the United States: Forsyth 
County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; northwest suburbs of Minneapolis, 
Minnesota; and Washington County, Maryland. Participants were followed up prospectively 
through examination 4 (2011–2013). Participants in the Minneapolis and Washington 
County sites were mostly white individuals, whereas only black individuals were recruited in 
Jackson. In addition to the baseline examination, the ARIC Study has conducted 4 follow-up 
examinations (1990–1992, 1993–1995, 1996–1998, and 2011–2013) along with annual 
telephone calls to determine vital status and obtain information on hospitalizations during 
the previous year. Ongoing surveillance of local hospitals has simultaneously been used to 
identify hospitalizations of ARIC Study participants, and trained abstractors have collected 
information on discharge diagnoses.
Key Points
Question
What are the racial differences in the associations of atrial fibrillation (AF) and its 
adverse outcomes (stroke, heart failure, coronary heart disease, and mortality)?
Findings
In 15 080 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the differences 
in adverse outcomes were greater for black individuals with AF than for white 
individuals. Black individuals consistently had a 1.5- to 2-fold higher rate differences for 
the adverse outcomes than white individuals.
Meaning
The rate difference for adverse outcomes indicates the distinct vulnerability and increased 
risk of adverse outcomes in black individuals with AF.

 In the present analysis, we excluded the ARIC Study participants with prevalent AF at 
baseline (n = 37), those missing baseline electrocardiograms (ECGs) (n = 242), those 
lacking data on essential covariates (n = 330), and those of race other than white or black (n 
= 103). After exclusions, 15 080 participants were included in the present analysis. The 
ARIC Study has been approved by institutional review boards at participating institutions, 
and all participants provided written informed consent.
AF Ascertainment
Ascertainment of AF in the ARIC Study has been previously described12,21 and conducted 
using 3 methods: study ECGs, hospital discharge codes, and death certificates. Standard, 10-
second, 12-lead ECGs were obtained at baseline and at each of the subsequent follow-up 
examinations. Tracings were performed in the supine position using MAC PC Personal 
Cardiographs (Marquette Electronics Inc) and transmitted electronically to the ARIC ECG 
Reading Center (Epidemiological Cardiology Research Center, Wake Forest School of 
Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina), where they underwent automated reading and 
coding. Tracings with AF were reviewed by a cardiologist. Incident AF was identified from 
hospitalizations or death certificates using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 427.31 or 427.32. Incident AF in the 
setting of cardiothoracic surgery was not defined as AF in the ARIC Study. Use of discharge 
coding for AF identification has been reported as having a median positive predictive value 
of 89% across multiple studies.22
Ascertainment of Cardiovascular Outcomes and Mortality
The outcomes of stroke, heart failure, and CHD were determined by physicians using 
validated adjudication protocols. Stroke was defined as sudden neurologic insult of 24-hour 
duration or longer or a neurologic insult associated with death without evidence of a 
nonstroke cause of death.23 Stroke events were ascertained from surveillance of ARIC Study 
participant hospitalization using ICD-9-CM codes 430 through 438 through 1997 and codes 
430 through 436 thereafter. Strokes were classified by physician review and computer 
algorithm with standardized criteria and determined as hemorrhagic or ischemic. Heart 
failure was ascertained by review of hospitalization records and death certificates for a heart 
failure diagnosis. Specifically, incident cases with an ICD-9-CM code of 428 (428.0–428.9) 
or International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code I50 were classified 
as heart failure.24 Coronary heart disease was determined using study surveillance and 
adjudicated as previously described.25 Symptoms, biomarkers, and ECGs were incorporated 
into a computerized algorithm.26 Disagreement between discharge coding and computer 
algorithm was adjudicated by the ARIC Mortality and Morbidity Classification Committee. 
For the present analysis, CHD was defined as definite or probable myocardial infarction or 
definite fatal CHD. All-cause mortality was determined as identification of death by 
telephone contact with participant proxy, obituaries, hospital records, death certificates, or 
vital statistics from the National Death Index.
Covariates
Age, race (categorized as white, black, or other), smoking status, and highest level of 
education were provided by self-report. Body mass index was calculated as weight in

 kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood 
pressure of 140mmHg or higher, a diastolic blood pressure higher than90mmHg, or use of 
medications to treat hypertension. Blood samples were obtained after individuals had fasted 
for 8 hours. Diabetes was determined by self-report of a physician diagnosis of diabetes, 
nonfasting blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher, fasting blood glucose level of 
126mg/dL or higher (to convert glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555), or use 
of insulin or other oral hypoglycemic medications. Measurement of serum creatinine in the 
ARIC Study has been described previously.27 Estimated glomerular filtration rate at visits 1, 
2, and 4 was calculated from serum creatinine as described by the Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemiology Collaboration,28 and a value less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 was used to define 
baseline chronic kidney disease. Prevalent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, 
and CHD at baseline were ascertained by self-report history of a diagnosis by a physician. 
Prevalent heart failure was identified as previously described using the Gothenburg criteria 
and review of medications.24 Incident chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease were defined using standardized methods articulated by the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Chronic Condition Data Warehouse.29
Statistical Analysis
We determined the distributions of continuous and categorical variables. The primary 
analysis was the relation of incident AF to the outcomes of stroke, heart failure, CHD, and 
all-cause mortality. We examined AF as a time-dependent exposure because we considered 
that increased duration of AF would contribute toward the risk of the outcome. To limit 
confounding by the covariates changing over time, we updated covariates across 
examinations. Covariates that could not be updated were used from the most immediate 
examination before the diagnosis of AF. We determined the age- and sex-standardized 
incidence of AF per 1000 person-years by race and examined the rates of the outcomes 
according to AF status and stratified by race. We calculated the rate ratio and rate difference 
of each outcome comparing participants with and without AF. We then examined the risk of 
the outcomes of stroke, heart failure, CHD, and mortality associated with incidence of AF in 
multivariable Cox proportional hazards models separately by race. For the analysis that 
examined stroke as an outcome, we additionally excluded participants with prevalent stroke 
(n = 269), yielding a sample size of 14 811. For heart failure, we excluded participants with 
prevalent heart failure (n = 686), yielding a sample size of 14 394. For CHD, we excluded 
participants with prevalent CHD (n = 722), yielding a sample size of 14 358. We examined 
the cumulative incidence of AF prospectively and constructed Kaplan-Meier curves for each 
outcome event stratifying by race. Study participants contributed observation time in the 
cohort without AF until the time of incident AF, when they began contributing toward the 
cohort with AF. All analyses were adjusted initially for age and sex (model 1); then for age, 
sex, educational level, body mass index, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, chronic 
kidney disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
and cardiovascular disease, including prevalent CHD, stroke, and heart failure (model 2); 
and then adjusted for all covariates as time-dependent (model 3).

 Results
After exclusions, at the baseline ARIC Study examination there were 15 080 participants 
(Table 1) with a mean (SD) age of 54.2 (5.8) years. Participants included 8290 women 
(55.5%) and 3831 black individuals (25.4%). Noteworthy racial differences in covariates at 
the baseline examination included body mass index (mean [SD], 27.0 [4.9] in white 
individuals and 29.6 [6.2] in black individuals) and the higher prevalence of hypertension 
and diabetes in black individuals.
Follow-up extended from the baseline examination (1987–1989) through the end of 2012. 
During a mean (SD) follow-up of 20.6 (6.2) years, there were 2348 cases of incident AF, 
1914 in white individuals with an incidence rate of 8.1 (95% CI, 7.7–8.5) per 1000 person-
years and 434 in black individuals with an incidence rate of 5.8 (95% CI, 5.2–6.3) per 1000 
person-years.
The age- and sex-standardized event rates per 1000 person-years stratified by race and AF 
status are listed in Table 2. Event rates were greater in black individuals for all outcomes in 
ARIC Study participants with and without AF. Overall, the association of AF with 
outcomes, as measured by the rate ratio, was similar in both racial groups. In both black and 
white individuals, stroke rates with AF were increased 5.0-fold compared with those without 
AF. The rate ratio for heart failure in individuals with AF was 13.7 (95% CI, 10.5–17.9) in 
white individuals and 9.7 (95% CI, 5.9–16.1) in black individuals compared with individuals 
without AF. White individuals with AF and black individuals with AF had a 6.0- to 7.0-fold 
increased rate of CHD than either race without AF and a 6.0-fold increased rate of all-cause 
mortality. The rate ratio for the association of AF with mortality was likewise 6.0-fold 
greater in white and black individuals with AF.
Marked racial differences were identified in examining the absolute (rather than relative) 
risk of outcomes associated with AF, as estimated using risk differences. The age- and sex-
adjusted rate differences for stroke, heart failure, and CHD comparing black individuals with 
AF with those without AF were considerably greater than the estimates for white 
individuals. The rate difference for stroke in black individuals with AF compared with black 
individuals without AF was twice that of white individuals with AF. Heart failure and CHD 
rate differences were 1.5- to 2.0-fold higher in black individuals than the estimates for white 
individuals. The rate difference in black individuals with AF (rate difference, 106.0; 95% CI, 
86.0–125.9) was roughly twice that of white individuals (rate difference, 55.9; 95% CI, 
48.1–63.7). Figure 1 presents the rate differences by race for the 4 outcomes.
The multivariable hazard ratios for association of AF with the outcomes by race are 
summarized in Table 3. Atrial fibrillation was associated with more than 3 times the risk of 
CHD in black individuals with AF compared with black individuals without AF. Atrial 
fibrillation in black individuals was associated with amore than 4.0-foldincreased risk of 
mortality compared with black individuals without AF. In contrast, AF in white individuals 
was associated with a 3.6-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality.
Figure 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier curve by AF status separately in white and black 
individuals. In all outcomes, black individuals without AF have lower event-free survival

 rates compared with white individuals without AF. With AF, black individuals similarly have 
lower event-free survival rates than white individuals. The curves for stroke in those with AF 
(Figure 2A) diverge early and rapidly. In Figure 2B, black individuals with AF rapidly 
accumulate heart failure events, stabilizing after approximately 15years. There is a similarly 
steeper descent in black individuals with AF and CHD(Figure 2C) compared with white 
individuals. Black individuals with AF had a rapid accumulation of mortality events (Figure 
2D). The log-rank tests for comparing events by race were all statistically significant (P < .
001 for all outcomes).
Discussion
We examined the associations of AF with adverse outcomes in the ARIC Study extending 
from the baseline examination to more than 20 years of follow-up. Consistent with a prior 
report12 from the ARIC Study, we observed a higher incidence of AF in white individuals 
compared with black individuals. Both white and black individuals with AF had markedly 
increased risks of the outcomes of stroke, heart failure, CHD, and all-cause mortality. We 
appreciated that the estimates of the associations with the outcomes had consistent overlap 
in black and white individuals. Importantly, the rate differences (the difference in incidence 
rates in those with and without AF) of the outcomes differed by race. We observed that black 
individuals with AF had an approximately 1.5- to 2.0-fold greater rate difference for each 
outcome than white individuals with AF. Our results indicate that black ARIC Study 
participants with AF are at considerably greater risk for associated adverse outcomes than 
white individuals with AF.
The distinction between the concepts of racial differences and disparities has been well 
articulated.30 Racial differences are independent of social factors, whereas racial disparities 
result from biases or practices with a systemic origin. Whether our findings may be 
described as racial differences or racial disparities merits attention. We have identified clear 
racial differences in adverse outcomes associated with AF but are not able to assert whether 
such findings are the result of racial disparities. The ARIC Study is a prospective, 
observational cohort; hence, we are not able to dissect or identify the causes of our findings. 
We consider that our results contribute toward an increasing number of observations 
describing significant racial differences in AF outcomes and complement the extant 
literature that suggests disparities in AF treatment.8,18,19,31
The racial differences in the outcomes examined in this study have been demonstrated 
outside the study of AF. In the ARIC Study and other cohorts,32,33 blacks have been 
previously found to have a greater incidence of the study outcomes. There has been limited 
study of racial differences in AF. Ina large, hospital-based registry (Get with the Guidelines–
Heart Failure) of black and white patients with heart failure, racial differences in in-hospital 
mortality were not observed.8 A large study11 of Medicare beneficiaries identified that black 
individuals with AF have a 2.0-foldgreater incidence of strokes than white individuals and 
along with community-based and registry studies8,11,18 identified that black individuals have 
concomitant decreased treatment with anticoagulation. Other literature corroborates the 
decreased use of anticoagulation in black individuals for stroke prevention in general.31,34 
Our investigation indicates that racial differences in the outcome of AF on adverse outcomes

 extend beyond stroke to other conditions associated previously with AF, specifically, heart 
failure, CHD, and all-cause mortality. These findings are derived from an established 
community-based cohort with carefully adjudicated cardiovascular end points and long 
follow-up.
Our findings have important public health implications. First and most immediate is the need 
to bolster prevention of adverse outcomes in black individuals with AF. Our results indicate 
the increased vulnerability of black individuals to the outcomes of stroke, CHD, heart 
failure, and mortality relative to white individuals. Racial disparities in outcomes associated 
with AF are not cited in professional statements and guidelines for treating AF and 
preventing its complications.35,36 The inclusion of racial disparities in AF as part of such 
documents may contribute toward improved treatment of AF in black individuals and other 
racial and ethnic minorities. It is further imperative that registries, such as the Get with the 
Guidelines–AFIB,37 increase our understanding of racial differences in outcomes associated 
with AF and optimize identifying the systemic causes for racial disparities.
Second, our results underscore the necessity of improving AF prevention in black 
individuals because the social and medical costs of the associated morbidity are high. Much 
has been made of the decreased incidence of AF in black individuals despite the increased 
prevalence of risk factors. The observation has been cited by the most recent professional 
society guidelines on AF evaluation and management.36 A priority is now to address the 
high public health costs of AF in black individuals. Efforts need to focus on detecting and 
addressing AF in black individuals to prevent its associated complications.
Third, black individuals and other racial and ethnic minorities have had markedly limited 
participation in clinical trials in AF. The AF Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm 
Management (n = 4060) included only 263 black individuals (<7% of the study cohort).38 
Black individuals comprise 1% to 4% of participants in AF registries.39,40 Pivotal 
studies41–43 of AF rate and rhythm control have unknown generalizability to black 
individuals. The sentinel clinical trials of novel oral anticoagulants included uniformly 
limited numbers of participants with nonwhite race or ethnicity. For example, less than 2% 
of trial participants assessing the safety of rivaroxaban were of black race,44 and subgroup 
analyses by race have not been uniformly reported in the novel oral anticoagulant trials.45 
Increased enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities would strengthen statistical power and 
enhance generalizability of trial findings to vulnerable populations. Furthermore, improving 
minority recruitment and enrollment to such studies is central to understanding mechanisms 
for disparities in AF.
Fourth, it is recognized that AF identification in black individuals has been challenging and 
may rely on the method of detection and ascertainment.46 Broader initiatives with 
contemporary monitoring will improve AF identification and may challenge the notion of 
racial differences in AF prevalence. Increased surveillance of AF in black individuals may 
also enhance recruitment to clinical trials and registries.
Our analysis has several strengths, including the long-term, prospective follow-up conducted 
in the ARIC Study, along with consistent ascertainment and adjudication of AF and the

 studied outcomes. The analysis is further strengthened by inclusion of more than 14 000 
participants and the generalizability enhanced by the geographic diversity of ARIC Study 
participant sites.
There are important limitations to the analysis that also merit attention. First, AF 
misclassification was possible. Reliance on ICD coding may have resulted in incomplete 
identification of participants with AF. We would expect that misclassification of AF status 
by ICD codes would be nondifferential with respect to the outcomes examined in this study, 
biasing our results toward the null. Second, subclinical AF, not recognized as a clinical 
diagnosis and hence not recorded using ICD coding, may also have been present in ARIC 
Study participants. It is possible that such individuals would be healthier and less likely to 
experience hospitalization. Third, although the ARIC Study participants come from 4 
distinct sites, the black participants included in this study are primarily recruited from 
Mississippi. The generalizability of our findings to black individuals living in other 
geographic regions in the United States is limited. Fourth, we did not adjust for treatments of 
AF, such as anticoagulation, cardioversion, or medications, which may confound the relation 
of AF and the examined outcomes. Likewise, we are not able to exclude residual 
confounding, particularly from exposures associated with adverse outcomes in AF (eg, left 
atrial volume and sleep-disordered breathing). Fifth, the ARIC Study is a predominantly 
biracial, community-based cohort, and as such generalizability to other races or ethnicities is 
also limited.
Conclusions
We observed markedly increased rates of stroke, heart failure, CHD, and mortality in black 
individuals with AF compared with white individuals in the prospective, community based 
ARIC Study. Our results contribute toward under standing the significant racial differences 
in black and white individuals with AF. Further study must now address the mechanisms for 
such differences to improve treatment of AF and prevent complications. Likewise, continued 
investigation of the causes and origins for such racial differences may identify racial 
disparities and suggest approaches to address and mitigate them.
