STUDY QUESTION: Is adult adiposity associated with early menopause?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Overall and abdominal adiposity were non-linearly associated with odds for early natural menopause with elevated
odds observed among women who were underweight in early or mid-adulthood compared to lean-normal weight women.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: High and low adiposity have been associated with reproductive function and may potentially impact tim-
ing of menopause. It is unclear whether various aspects of adiposity are associated with risk of early menopause.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Prospective cohort study that examined data from 78 759 premenopausal women from the
Nurses’ Health Study II who were followed from 1989 to 2011 for incidence of early natural menopause.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were aged 25–42 years and premenopausal at baseline in 1989,
when information on menopausal status, height and weight was reported via questionnaire. Information on menopausal status, type of meno-
pause (natural, surgical, radiation/chemotherapy), hormone therapy use and weight was updated every two years along with information on
smoking, physical activity and other behavioral and health-related factors. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios
for early menopause, defined as natural menopause before age 45 years, by aspects of adiposity.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Early natural menopause was reported by 2804 participants. Body mass index (BMI)
was non-linearly associated with risk for early menopause. Compared to women with BMI = 18.5–22.4 kg/m2, those with BMI < 18.5 kg/m2
had a significant 30% higher odds of early menopause (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08, 1.57), while women with BMIs between
25.0–29.9 kg/m2 had significant 21–30% lower odds. Odds were not higher in women with BMI ≥ 35.0 kg/m2 in fully adjusted analysis. Non-
linear associations with higher odds in underweight women were also observed for age 18 and age 35 BMI, though lower odds for overweight
women was only observed for age 35 BMI. Odds were highest among women with age 18 BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 reporting severe weight cycling.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Though weight and early menopause status were self-reported, validation studies con-
ducted among Nurses’ Health Study participants suggest that self-reported weight is highly correlated with directly measured weight, and pro-
spective self-reported menopausal status is highly reproducible. It is possible that underweight women may have been misclassified with an
earlier age at menopause if being underweight led to amenorrhea.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In one of the few studies to prospectively examine a variety of adiposity measures and
risk for early menopause, our findings that women who were underweight in early or mid-adulthood had elevated risk for early menopause
can assist in efforts to better understand the etiology of early menopause. Additional prospective research is needed to understand how low
adiposity may physiologically impact timing of menopause.

Introduction
Up to 10% of women experience early menopause, defined as the ces-
sation of ovarian function before age 45 (Pelosi et al., 2015). Early
menopause is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease,
cognitive decline, osteoporosis and premature mortality (van Der
Voort et al., 2003; Shuster et al., 2010; Gold, 2011; Wellons et al.,
2012). In addition, early fertility decline has family planning conse-
quences as women increasingly delay childbearing (Burger et al., 2007;
Broekmans et al., 2009). Though genetic factors partially account for
increased risk of early menopause, modifiable lifestyle, reproductive
and environmental risk factors may also play a role (Gold, 2011; Pelosi
et al., 2015).
Adiposity is associated with reproductive function and potentially
also timing of menopause, yet findings of studies examining overall adi-
posity (e.g. body mass index [BMI], relative weight) and age at meno-
pause have been inconsistent. Some have found earlier age at
menopause among underweight women (Hardy et al., 2008). Others
have found higher BMI associated with earlier menopause (Dratva
et al., 2009) or ovarian insufficiency (Luborsky et al., 2003), while
some report no association (Bromberger et al., 1997; Gold et al.,
2001; Aydin, 2010). A recent meta-analysis found modest associations
between being underweight and earlier age at menopause, and being
overweight or obese and later age at menopause (Tao et al., 2015).
However, the majority of studies included were limited by their cross-
sectional design, with the authors noting the need for more studies
better controlled for smoking (Tao et al., 2015).
Adiposity at different ages (e.g. early versus mid-adulthood) may
have different effects on early menopause risk, because of changes in
reproductive function over time, yet, few studies have directly exam-
ined this (Hardy et al., 2008). In addition, weight distribution is import-
ant to consider as it is more closely related to metabolic and
cardiovascular conditions than overall adiposity (Cornier et al., 2011).
Furthermore, weight change and weight cycling may be associated
with menopause timing, though few studies have considered these
(Bromberger et al., 1997; Dorjgochoo et al., 2008; Aydin, 2010), espe-
cially in the context of overall adiposity.
To better understand these relations, we prospectively examined
associations of overall adiposity, weight distribution and weight change
and early natural menopause among women participating in the
Nurses’ Health Study 2 (NHS2). In addition, we compared associa-
tions between overall adiposity in early and mid-adulthood and early
menopause.
Materials and Methods
Study design and population
The NHS2 is a prospective epidemiological study of 116 430 registered
nurses aged 25–42 from 11 US states who responded to a mailed ques-
tionnaire in 1989. Participants provided information on their medical
history and health-related behaviors, such as smoking and physical activity.
Participants have completed questionnaires every two years to update
information on health factors and to provide information on new disease
diagnoses with a response rate for each questionnaire cycle ≥89%. The
study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the
Harvard Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s
Hospital.
Assessment of early menopause
The current analysis was limited to women who indicated that they were
premenopausal at baseline in 1989 (n = 108 542; Fig. 1). On the initial
questionnaire and each subsequent biennial questionnaire, participants
were asked to report their menopausal status by indicating if their periods
had ceased permanently, and if so, the age they ceased and the cause (nat-
ural, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy). Age at menopause was defined as
age at which the menstrual cycle ceased, as confirmed by 12 subsequent
consecutive months of amenorrhea. For the few women who inconsist-
ently reported postmenopausal status (i.e. reported being premenopausal
after reporting postmenopausal status), we defined age at menopause as
age at which periods ceased followed by consistent reporting of this cessa-
tion on at least three consecutive questionnaires. Women were also asked
to report on their hormone replacement therapy use on each question-
naire, including duration and type of use, which was used to categorize
hormone therapy as prior to menopause, following menopause, or both.
Early natural menopause was defined as naturally occurring menopause
before age 45, between return of the baseline questionnaire and June 2011
(i.e. the year in which the youngest NHS2 participants reached age 45).
Women reporting menopause before age 45 and who had hysterectomy,
bilateral oophorectomy, radiation or chemotherapy prior to menopause
were excluded (n = 7970; Fig. 1). In addition, women who did not report
menopause before age 45, but who had bilateral oophorectomy, hysterec-
tomy or cancer (not including non-melanoma skin cancer) prior to age 45
were excluded (n = 6683) to maximize the comparability of comparison
groups.
Assessment of adiposity
Weight at age 18 (lbs.), current weight, and height were reported at base-
line. Current weight was then reported on each biennial questionnaire.
BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. We then divided women
into seven categories: <18.5 kg/m2, 18.5–22.49, 22.5–24.99, 25.0–27.49,
27.5–29.99, 30.0–34.99, ≥35.0. Underweight at age 18 was further subca-
tegorized to <17.5 kg/m2 and 17.5–<18.5 kg/m2 to reflect the lower
underweight cut-point of 17.5 kg/m2 for age 18 females recommended by
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Anonymous, 2014).
Weight change from age 18 to 35 was calculated by subtracting age 18
weight from age 35 weight. In 1993, women were asked to measure and
report their waist circumference at their navel and their hip circumference
at the widest part (including buttocks) to the nearest 0.25 inch. Waist-to-
hip ratio was calculated by dividing waist circumference by hip circumfer-
ence. In 1993, women were also asked to report how many times they
had intentionally lost 5–9, 10–19, 20–49 and ≥50 pounds between ages
18–30 excluding illness and pregnancy-related changes. We defined severe
weight cyclers as women who lost ≥20 pounds three or more times
between ages 18 and 30, and mild weight cyclers as women who did not

 meet this criteria, but lost ≥10 pounds three or more times during this
timeframe (Field et al. 2009).
Covariates
Factors potentially associated with early menopause and adiposity were
assessed as covariates. Information on age, pack-years of smoking, parity,
and oral contraceptive (OC) use was collected and updated biennially.
Age at menarche (1989), race/ethnicity (2005) and income (2001) were
measured at a single time point over the course of the study. Dietary micro
and macronutrient intake was assessed with a food frequency question-
naire (FFQ) in 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2011. Alcohol consump-
tion was assessed on the initial questionnaire and on each FFQ.
Breastfeeding history was assessed from all cohort members in 1997, and
again in 2003 from the subgroup of women reporting pregnancies after
1997. Physical activity was assessed in 1989, 1991, 1997, 2005 and 2009,
when participants were asked to indicate how much time they spent each
week participating in a variety of recreational physical activities. This infor-
mation was used to calculate metabolic equivalent task (MET)-hours per
week (Ainsworth et al. 1993).
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC). We compared age-standardized baseline characteristics
between BMI categories. Logistic regression was used to estimate the
odds ratio of early menopause for each BMI category, using lean-normal
weight women (i.e. BMI 18.5–22.5 kg/m2) as the referent. Odds ratios
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for BMI at base-
line (1989) to assess the overall association between BMI and early meno-
pause. For illustrative purposes, restricted cubic spline models were used
to visualize the adjusted associations between early menopause and
baseline BMI. Associations between waist circumference (n = 35 477) and
waist-to-hip ratio (n = 35 522) and early menopause were also assessed
among women who were premenopausal when this information was gath-
ered to determine if central adiposity was associated with risk.
In sensitivity analyses, we used Cox proportional hazard regression to
assess hazard ratios for early menopause by baseline BMI and by BMI updated
throughout follow-up. Accrual of participant follow-up time (in months) began
on the date of return of the 1989 questionnaire and continued until meno-
pause or first report of hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, cancer (not
including non-melanoma skin cancer), loss to follow-up, death or 45th birth-
day. Analyses were stratified on age in months and questionnaire cycle.
Multivariable logistic regression included covariates selected a priori as
factors associated with early menopause and/or BMI. Because the inclu-
sion of other covariates in regression models did not substantively change
the OR, we included only these a priori factors: age, pack-years cigarette
smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, age at menarche, OC use,
parity and breastfeeding duration. In addition, as reproductive variables
such as parity may lie on the causal pathway between BMI and early meno-
pause, we ran separate multivariable models adding these variables. To
examine whether central adiposity was independently associated with
early menopause risk, we additionally adjusted for BMI.
We then compared associations of BMI at ages 18 and 35 with early
menopause. To maximize comparability of results across time periods, we
limited this analysis to women premenopausal at age 35 who had BMI
measures for both ages (n = 35 359).
We also examined whether risk of early menopause was associated
with weight change from age 18 to age 35, and with weight cycling
between ages 18 and 30; the weight cycling analysis was also limited to
women who were premenopausal in 1993. In post hoc analysis, we strati-
fied the analysis of weight cycling and early menopause by age 18 BMI to
assess whether associations varied by early adulthood adiposity.

 Because start of hormone therapy use could potentially precede the final
menstrual period and lead to misclassification of early menopause, we con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis excluding all women who reported hormone ther-
apy use before age 45 if use was also prior to menopause (n = 12 216
excluded). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding women who
reported menopause between the ages of 45–47 (n = 10 298 excluded) to
assess whether findings were impacted by potential misclassification of age at
menopause. Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding women who
had gastrointestinal and connective tissue conditions that may be associated
with both early menopause and adiposity (ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease,
rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus; n = 2655) to assess confounding.
Because some studies suggest that smoking may modify associations
between adiposity and age at menopause (Willett et al. 1983) we assessed
interaction between smoking status (ever smoker, non-smoker) and base-
line BMI using the likelihood ratio test, and stratified associations between
baseline BMI and early menopause by smoking status. We also assessed
interaction between physical activity (<3 MET*h/week, ≥3–<49 MET*h/
week, ≥49 MET*h/week) and baseline BMI.
Results
After exclusions, 78,759 participants had early natural menopause or
had menopause at age ≥ 45 and had information on adiposity. Of these,
2804 had early natural menopause (Fig. 1). Baseline characteristics are
presented by BMI in Table I. The mean age at baseline was 34.8 years
(SD 4.6). Age was positively associated with BMI, while age at menarche
and physical activity were inversely associated with adiposity. Alcohol
consumption, duration of OC use, and duration of breastfeeding were
lowest among obese women. Underweight women and obese women
with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 had the lowest parity and were more likely to
have been non-smokers.
We observed a non-linear J-shaped association between BMI at
baseline and risk of early menopause (Table II; Fig. 2). In age-adjusted
and multivariable analyses, risk was significantly higher among under-
weight women (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) compared with lean-normal
weight women (BMI 18.5–22.4 kg/m2). Results were similar with and
without adjustment for reproductive factors. In our fully adjusted mod-
el (Model 2), underweight women had 30% higher odds (95% CI =
1.08, 1.57), whereas, the odds were significantly lower among over-
weight women with BMI 25.0–27.4 kg/m2 (OR = 0.79, 95% CI =
0.69, 0.89) and BMI 27.5–29.9 kg/m2 (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.58,
0.84) than lean-normal weight women. Similarly, obese women with a
BMI of 30.0–34.9 kg/m2 had lower risk of early menopause compared
to lean-normal weight women in fully adjusted analyses (OR = 0.83,
95% CI = 0.71, 0.98). Though BMI ≥ 35.0 kg/m2 had non-significantly
elevated odds for early menopause in multivariable analysis that
adjusted for nonproductive factors, the association was no longer

Adiposity and risk of early menopause

 elevated after adjustment for reproductive factors. Results from Cox
proportional hazard regression models evaluating baseline BMI and
BMI updated throughout follow-up were highly similar in shape and
magnitude to our main analysis (Supplementary Table SI).
When examining measures of central adiposity, relationships were
also non-linear (Table II). Women with intermediate waist-to-hip
ratios of 0.80–<0.85 and 0.85–<0.90 had a significantly lower risk of
early menopause compared to women with the lowest waist-to-hip
ratio (waist-to-hip ratio < 0.75). Risk was not higher among women
with higher waist-hip ratio. Further adjustment for BMI only modestly
attenuated results (Supplementary Table SII).
Table III presents results of analyses examining BMI at ages 18 and
35 as predictors of early menopause. Results differed somewhat by
age. Women who were underweight at age 18 (<17.5 kg/m2) had a
50% higher odds compared to lean-normal weight women (OR =
1.54, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.90); however, odds were not elevated for BMI
17.5–18.5 kg/m2. When evaluating the effect of BMI at age 35 in fully
adjusted models, compared to lean-normal weight women, odds were
significantly higher among those who were underweight (<18.5 kg/m2)
(OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.21, 2.09) and significantly lower among over-
weight women with BMI 27.5–29.9 (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.54 0.92).
Upon mutually adjusting for BMI at ages 18 and 35, the increased risk
observed among underweight women was modestly attenuated but
persisted at both ages (Supplemental Table SIII).
Women who lost 20 or more pounds from age 18 to 35 had margin-
ally but not significantly higher risk for early menopause in fully adjusted
models compared to women who gained 5.1–15.0 pounds (OR =
1.38, 95% CI = 0.97, 1.96) (Table III). Additionally, adjustment for age
18 BMI had minimal impact on results (Supplementary Table SIII).
We did not find weight cycling between ages 18 and 30 to be asso-
ciated with early menopause in analyses including all women (Table IV).
However, in post hoc analysis stratified by age 18 BMI, women with a
BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 who were severe weight cyclers had more than dou-
ble the odds of early menopause compared to noncyclers in adjusted
analysis (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.08, 5.33); of note is the small number
of participants included in this analysis (n with early menopause = 7).
No associations were observed between weight cycling and early meno-
pause among normal weight or overweight/obese women at age 18.
We observed similar J-shaped associations of BMI and early meno-
pause in both smokers and non-smokers and interactions between
BMI and smoking status were not significant (P = 0.34) (Table V).
Among smokers, underweight women had significantly higher odds for
early menopause (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.90), while odds were
significantly lower among both categories of overweight women

Risks were somewhat attenuated among non-smokers and not signifi-
cant; underweight women had an OR of 1.22 (95% CI = 0.95, 1.55),
while women with BMI of 27.5–29.9 had an OR of 0.80 (95%CI = 0.63,
1.02) when compared to lean-normal weight women. We also did not
find effect modification of the association between BMI and early meno-
pause by physical activity (P = 0.53).
Findings were similar in sensitivity analyses excluding women who
reported using hormone therapy prior to menopause and before age
45 (Supplementary Table SIV), excluding women who had menopause
between the ages of 45–47 (Supplementary Table SV), and excluding
women who had ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arth-
ritis and systemic lupus (Supplementary Table SVI).
Discussion
In our prospective study, we observed a non-linear, J-shaped associ-
ation between BMI and risk of early natural menopause. Compared to
lean-normal weight women with a BMI of 18.5–22.4 kg/m2, under-
weight women had significantly 30% higher odds of early menopause. In
contrast, overweight women had a significant 21–30% lower odds.
Intermediate abdominal adiposity was associated with lower risk when
compared to the lowest level, which persisted after adjustment for BMI.
Ours is one of few prospective studies to assess a variety of adiposity
measures and timing of menopause. Similar to our study, Hardy et al.
found that being underweight at age 36 was associated with earlier age
at menopause (HR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.65) in a prospective study
of 1593 women (Hardy et al. 2008). Contrary to our findings, they did
not observe increased risk among women who were underweight at
younger ages, though this may be attributable to differences in the defin-
ition of underweight between studies. We also observed higher risk of
early menopause among women with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 at age 18, though
risk was attenuated and no longer significant after adjustment for repro-
ductive factors. Hardy et al. examined risk among obese women as a
whole (>30 kg/m2) and did not observe higher risk.
Our findings suggest that substantial weight loss may increase risk
for early natural menopause. Women who lost ≥20 pounds from age
18 to 35 had a higher risk compared to women who gained 5–15
pounds, though findings were attenuated and marginally significant
after adjusting for reproductive factors. In addition, weight cycling was
also associated with higher risk. Our finding that weight loss may be
associated with early menopause is consistent with the findings from
several studies of age at menopause (Leidy, 1996; Kok et al., 2006).
Mechanisms underlying the association of underweight and early
menopause are unclear. Low body weight increases risk for functional
hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA), which results from dysregulation of
the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadotropin (HPG) axis leading to anovula-
tion, hypoestrogenism, and increased infertility risk (Meczekalski et al.,
2014). While reproductive factors associated with fewer ovulatory
cycles (e.g. greater parity, oral contraceptive use) have generally been
associated with later menopausal age (Pelosi et al., 2015), it is possible
that anovulation caused by HPG axis disruption is differentially asso-
ciated with rate of reproductive aging. FHA also commonly leads to
increased activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading
to elevated levels of corticotrophin releasing hormone, aderenocortico-
trophin, and cortisol (Meczekalski et al., 2014). It is possible that chronic
elevation of these stress related hormones may increase early meno-
pause risk, as some studies have found earlier age of menopause among
women experiencing elevated stress levels (Bromberger et al., 1997).
Importantly, ‘underweight’ is a heterogeneous category that includes
women with anorexia nervosa and women who are constitutionally
thin, and some studies have found that amenorrhea and hormonal
imbalances only occurred among women with anorexia nervosa
(Estour et al., 2014). Unfortunately, we were unable to differentiate
between these two groups in our study. Additionally, while irritable
bowel syndrome and autoimmune disorders are potentially associated
with BMI and with premature ovarian insufficiency (Pelosi et al., 2015),
we did not observe evidence of confounding by these conditions.
Adult body size may be correlated with size at birth and conse-
quently size of the ovarian pool, which is determined prenatally (Leidy,
1996). A smaller ovarian pool would potentially result in an earlier age
of menopause. Additional studies should examine relationships
between birth weight, early life adiposity and menopause timing.
We observed lower risk for early menopause among overweight
women, which is consistent with findings from a meta-analysis by Tao
Figure 2 Adjusted odds ratios of early menopause by BMI in 1989,
multivariable odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of early nat-
ural menopause were derived from restricted cubic spline models. Data
from Nurses Heatlth Study II 1989–2011, adjusted for age at baseline
(continuous), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, Asian, Other), phys-
ical activity (<3, 3–49, >49 metabolic equivalent task (MET)*h/week),
pack-years cigarette smoking (0, 1–10, 10–15, >15 pack-years), alcohol
consumption (0, 0–10, 10–30, ≥30 g of alcohol). The reference BMI is
20.5; a total of 21 knots were specified ranging from BMI of 17.7 to 37.5
with likelihood ratio tests comparing models with and without cubic
spline terms to assess non-linearity yielding P < 0.0001.

 et al. in which overweight women had a later menopausal age (Tao
et al., 2015). Adipose tissue produces the endogenous estrogen
estrone, which though produced at lower levels than estradiol in pre-
menopausal years, at higher levels could potentially supplant declining
estradiol levels in later reproductive years (Siiteri, 1975; Forney et al.,
1981; Kershaw and Flier, 2004; Tao et al., 2015).
Conversely, we did not observe lower risk among women with BMI ≥
35.0 kg/m2, especially for BMI measured at age 35. Premenopausal
obesity is associated with anovulatory infertility, increased androgen pro-
duction and decreased serum sex hormone binding-globulin level
(Pasquali and Gambineri, 2006). In addition, some studies have found
lower levels of Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) among obese women
compared to normal weight women (Freeman et al., 2007; Steiner et al.,
2010), though others report no association (Bertrand et al., 2016; Jung
et al., 2017). AMH, produced by granulosa cells in the ovary, is a marker
of ovarian reserve highly correlated with antral follicle count (AFC) in
older premenopausal women (van Rooij, Ilse et al., 2005; La Marca and
Volpe, 2006). It is not clear what leads to lower AMH levels observed
among obese women as a study by Su et al., found that AFC did not dif-
fer between obese and normal weight women despite lower AMH
levels among obese women (Su et al., 2008). In addition, some studies
have reported the highest AMH levels among women with the lowest
BMI (Freeman et al., 2007; Bernardi et al., 2017); it remains unclear how
AMH and AFC contribute to the higher risk we observed among under-
weight women.
In general, we did not find that the addition of reproductive risk fac-
tors (age at menarche, duration of OC use, parity, duration of breast-
feeding) to regression models substantially affected ORs for adiposity
and early menopause. However, the addition of these factors did
attenuate the higher risk observed among women with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2,
and among those with large weight loss, suggesting that differences in
these factors may explain some of the observed associations. We also

 adjusted for physical activity, which at high exercise levels has been found
to be associated with menstrual cycle dysfunction and functional hypo-
thalamic amenorrhea (Warren and Perlroth, 2001; Meczekalski et al.,
2014). Women in our study generally had low to moderate levels of
physical activity with very few exercising at levels that would disrupt men-
strual cycle function.
Some studies have also found that associations between measures
of adiposity and menopause timing are only found among smokers
(Willett et al., 1983; Hardy et al., 2000). Compounds found in cigarette
smoke may be toxic to the ovary and have been associated with both
follicular loss and impaired follicular growth (Dechanet et al., 2011).
Hardy et al. found that underweight smokers had the earliest age of
perimenopause compared to other smokers, whereas no associations
with BMI were observed among non-smokers (Hardy et al., 2000).
We did not find that smoking status significantly modified the associa-
tions (P = 0.38), though the non-linear relation was more pronounced
among smokers.
Our study has several potential limitations. First, BMI was self-reported,
which could result in misclassification. However, as a validation study
among Nurses’ Health Study participants found that prospectively gath-
ered self-reported and measured weights were highly correlated (r =
0.97), we anticipate minimal misclassification of BMI (Rimm et al., 1990).
Nonetheless, it is possible that a greater degree of misclassification
occurred for age 18 BMI, because it was retrospectively reported at base-
line, potentially biasing our findings to the null. Age at menopause was also
self-reported. However, we do not anticipate that this resulted in mis-
classification that substantially impacted our findings because prospective
reporting of menopause has been found to be highly reproducible
(Colditz et al., 1987) and our findings were unchanged after excluding
women who had menopause between the ages of 45 and 47.
Another potential source of misclassification of menopausal status is
premenopausal hormone therapy use, which often leads to menstrual
bleeding making it difficult to ascertain age at menopause. However,
findings were unchanged after excluding women who reported using
hormone therapy prior to menopause and before the age of 45. Yet, it
is possible that underweight women with early menopause were more
likely to be excluded in this analysis, as on average underweight
women initiate hormone therapy at earlier ages (Hardy et al., 2008). It
is also possible that underweight women may have been misclassified
with an earlier age at menopause if their underweight status led to
amenorrhea. Because our findings were similar in models that included
and excluded hormone use, this is unlikely to have impacted our find-
ings. However, it should be noted that our findings are specific to early
natural menopause, and that associations and mechanisms may be dif-
ferent for early menopause occurring as a result of cancer, oophorec-
tomy and/or underlying causes leading to surgical menopause.
We had limited power to assess whether associations varied by
race/ethnicity because our study population was predominantly
White. Studies have found that associations between adiposity and
risk for health outcomes (WHO Expert Consultation, 2004; World
Health Organization, 2008) and adiposity and age at menopause
may vary by race/ethnicity (Gold, 2011). Additional studies are
needed in diverse populations to assess whether associations vary
by race/ethnicity.

Adiposity and risk of early menopause
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/32/12/2522/4562350 by guest on 02 June 2019
 Strengths of our study include the prospective design, large sample size,
longitudinal assessment of BMI, assessment of both overall and abdominal
measures of adiposity, and our adjustment for multiple confounders. In
addition, this is among the first prospective studies to focus specifically on
adiposity and early menopause, which has been associated with increased
risk for cardiovascular disease and other health conditions.
Conclusion
In summary, our findings suggest that both overall and abdominal adi-
posity are non-linearly associated with risk of early natural menopause.
Women who were underweight in early or mid-adulthood, especially
those who reported severe weight cycling, had higher risk for early
menopause compared to lean-normal weight women. Additional pro-
spective research is needed to understand how low adiposity may
physiologically impact the timing of menopause.
