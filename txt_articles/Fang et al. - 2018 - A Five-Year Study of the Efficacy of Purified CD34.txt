ABSTRACT
Angiitis‐induced critical limb ischemia (AICLI) patients constitute a remarkable proportion of no‐
option critical limb ischemia (CLI) patients. Stem cell therapy has become an innovative and
promising option for no‐option CLI patients. As one of these promising stem cell therapies, puri-
fied CD34+ cell transplantation (PuCeT) has shown favorable short‐term results. However, the
long‐term efficacy of PuCeT has yet to be reported. This study evaluates the long‐term efficacy
of PuCeT in AICLI patients. Twenty‐seven AICLI patients were enrolled from May 2009 to
December 2011. Granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF) and enoxaparin sodium were
administered for 5 days. On day 5, CD34+ cell isolation was performed, and cells were trans-
planted by intramuscular injection. The primary endpoint, major‐amputation‐free survival rate
(MAFS), as well as secondary endpoints, such as peak pain‐free walking time (PPFWT) and the
Wong‐Baker FACES pain rating scale score (WFPRSS), were routinely evaluated during the 5‐year
follow‐up period. The endpoints were as follows: the MAFS was 88.89%; PPFWT increased from
3 ± 3 to 17 ± 6 minutes; WFPRSS decreased from 7 ± 2 to 0.3 ± 1.7; the ulcer healing rate was
85.71%; the recurrence rate was 11.11%; and SF‐36v2 scores were significantly improved at
5 years after PuCeT. The rate of labor recovery 5 years after PuCeT was 65.38%, and no severe
adverse effect was observed during the treatment. PuCeT demonstrated long‐term efficacy and
durability as a treatment of AICLI not only in achieving limb salvage but also in recovering the
labor competence and improving the quality of life of patients. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Long‐term efficacy and durability of autologous transplantation of purified CD34+ cells was
shown for the treatment of angiitis‐induced no‐option critical limb ischemia, including achieve-
ment of ideal limb salvage, recovery of labor competence, and improved quality of life.
INTRODUCTION
Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a classic vascular
disease caused by various etiologies and is
associated with a substantial major amputation
rate and mortality [1]. Endovascular and surgi-
cal reconstruction are the mainstream treat-
ments
for
CLI.
Particularly,
the
rapid
advancements in endovascular techniques and
devices have improved the recanalization rate.
Nevertheless,
the
classical
treatments
are
unfeasible in approximately 15%–20% of CLI
patients [1] (no‐option CLI) due to a high post-
operative re‐occlusion rate or poor anatomical
conditions. Among CLI patients, AICLI is defined
as CLI caused by thromboangiitis obliterans
(TAO) or by angiitis‐related autoimmunological
diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE), Crohn's disease, erythema nodosum,
scleroderma,
and
psoriasis.
These
diseases
show a common propensity for affecting the
distal small or microvessels and destroying the
anatomic
run‐off
necessary
for
either
the
endovascular or the surgical reconstruction.
Therefore, AICLI composes a remarkable pro-
portion of the no‐option CLI population.
In the last 20 years, cell therapy has rapidly
developed and has been considered a promis-
ing treatment for CLI patients. As one of the
stem cell therapies, PuCeT has demonstrated
encouraging outcomes [2, 3]. Similarly, in our
pilot study conducted from 2009 to 2011,

 PuCeT demonstrated favorable early outcomes in AICLI [4].
The current study is an extension of our pilot study and aims
to evaluate the long‐term efficacy of PuCeT in AICLI patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhong-
shan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University (the number of the
approval: No. 2009‐016) and was conducted according to the
World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki. All candi-
dates provided written informed consent before enrollment.
Patient Enrollment
From May 2009 to December 2011, 27 patients with no‐option
AICLI were enrolled in the study. The inclusion and exclusion
criteria have been previously described [4].
Treatment Procedures
G‐CSF and enoxaparin sodium were subcutaneously adminis-
tered to the patients for 5 days. Apheresis (COM.TEC; Fresenius
HemoCare, Friedberg, Germany) and subsequent cell isolation
via immunomagnetic separation (CliniMACS instrument and
CD34 reagent; Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany)
was performed on day 5. Apheresis and purified products were
tested for white blood cell (WBC) and CD34+ cell counts. Cell
transplantation was performed by intramuscular injection under
spinal anesthesia (for the lower extremities) or general anesthe-
sia (for the upper extremities). Additional details about the pro-
cedure have been previously described [4]. Patients with
autoimmunological diseases were administered regular immu-
nological treatment and follow‐up by rheumatologists.
Data Collection and Evaluation
Endpoints.
The primary endpoint was the major‐amputation‐
free survival rate (MAFS). The secondary endpoints included
peak pain‐free walking time (PPFWT) on a treadmill at 2.5 km/h
and 10% incline, the Wong‐Baker FACES pain rating scale score
(WFPRSS), the ulcer healing rate, and the recurrence rate. Data
of all these parameters were collected before PuCeT and at
4, 8, 12, 24, 52 (1 year), 104 (2 years), 156 (3 years),
208 (4 years), and 260 weeks (5 years) after PuCeT.
SF‐36v2 was used to evaluate the quality of life of the
patients at baseline, 1 year, and 5 years after transplantation.
The questionnaires were completed either by the patients
themselves or with the help of their family members or doc-
tors. The time points at which patients returned to work were
also recorded during the follow‐up evaluations.
Recurrence was defined as ischemia reoccurrence on the
treated limb after its complete recovery (relief of rest pain,
and healing of ulcer and gangrene), while ischemia onset was
defined as new lesions on the untreated limbs.
The major adverse clinical events included all‐cause death,
major amputation, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC)
therapy, repeat CD34+ cell therapy, or endovascular treatment on
the ipsilateral limb after the initial transplantation. The minor
adverse clinical events included any adverse events during mobili-
zation, apheresis or injection; abnormal WBC count; and patholog-
ical angiogenesis. The incidences of all of these events were
recorded at 12, 24, 52 (1 year), 104 (2 years), 156 (3 years),
208 (4 years), and 260 weeks (5 years) after transplantation. To
detect potential pathological angiogenesis, the fundus oculi of the
patients were examined by an ophthalmologist before transplan-
tation and at 4, 8, 12, 24, 52 (1 year), 104 (2 years), 156 (3 years),
208 (4 years), and 260 weeks (5 years) after PuCeT.
Statistical analysis.
The efficacy parameters were expressed
as the mean ± standard deviation and were analyzed via t‐test.
Qualitative data were expressed as percentage. A value of p
< .05 was considered a statistically significant difference. The
Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the overall sur-
vival rate (OS) and MAFS. The analysis was completed using
SPSS 22 software (IBM Corporation, NY, USA).

A Five‐Year Study of PuCeT for AICLI
 27 were AICLI patients. These patients had a mean age of 40
± 8 years (range, 23–54) and included 26 males and 1 female.
Until December 2016, 26 patients underwent regular follow‐
up evaluations for an average of 75 ± 8 months (range, 61–92);
however, patient 22 withdrew from the study 12 months after
therapy. Of the 27 patients, 23 patients were diagnosed with
TAO according to the Olin criteria [5], and the remaining
4 patients were diagnosed with angiitis due to other etiolo-
gies, such as SLE, erythema nodosum, and Crohn's disease.
Patients 7 and 10 were already diagnosed with erythema
nodosum and Crohn's disease before ischemia. For this reason,
we highly suspected that the vasculitis was secondary to their
autoimmune diseases. A total of 32 limbs (4 upper limbs and
28 lower limbs) were treated. The dose of transplanted CD34+
cells was 7.02 ± 6.13 × 107 per patient, 10.20 ± 9.70 × 105 per
kilogram and 9.88 ± 9.81 × 105 per kilogram per limb. Technical
success was achieved in all patients.
At enrollment, 26 patients (96.30%, 26/27, except patient 16)
were current smokers. Although the literature and education
about the harm of smoking and the importance of quitting
tobacco was frequently provided, only 7 patients successfully quit
smoking. The other 19 (73.08%, 19/26) relapsed within 1 year
after transplantation. Eight patients (8/23) with TAO presented
with superficial thrombophlebitis. None of the patients were
diagnosed with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus,
or cerebral or myocardial infarction. In addition, all 27 patients
underwent the best medical treatment for more than 3 months
prior to PuCeT. Three patients underwent toe amputations
before transplantation. Three patients underwent endovascular
interventions, including percutaneous transluminal angioplasty
(PTA), stenting, and/or thrombolysis. Patient 10 underwent a
thrombectomy twice, and patient 13 underwent the surgery
once. All patients underwent antiplatelet therapy with alprostadil
and/or cilostazol for more than 3 months before PuCeT.
Efficacy Evaluation
During the follow‐up period, 3 patients (patients 9, 24, and
25) underwent major amputations, 2 below and 1 above the
knee. Patients 9 and 25 underwent amputations within
12 weeks of the transplantation because of the unrelieved
gangrenes and rest pain, and patient 24 required an amputa-
tion below the left knee at week 120. Patient 6 had a minor
amputation at week 252. The MAFS was 88.89% (24/27) at
week 208 and remained the same at week 260 (Fig. 1).
Fifteen patients (15/27) were able to take the PPFWT test
before transplantation. The PPFWT value is recorded as 0 if a
patient cannot walk. The average PPFWT was 3 ± 3 minutes (n = 27,
range, 0–10) at baseline and increased significantly to 9 ± 6 minutes
(n = 25, range, 0–21) (p < .001) at week 12, 15 ± 7 minutes (n = 25,
range, 0–21) (p < .001) at week 24, and 17 ± 6 minutes (n = 23,
range, 4–21) (p < .001) at week 260. At week 260, 23 patients
(23/27, 3 amputated and 1 withdrew) were able to take the PPFWT
test. The serial changes of PPFWT are shown in Figure 2A. Of note,
13 of these patients completed the entire 21‐minute test: they
could walk longer than 21 minutes and only needed to stop
because the treadmill was set to stop at 21 minutes. However, 4 of
these 13 patients were not able to walk at baseline.
The severity of rest pain was evaluated using the WFPRSS,
for which the average pre‐PuCeT value was 7 ± 2 (n = 27,

 range, 4–10). The average time to onset of rest pain relief was
3 ± 1 weeks (n = 27, range, 1–4). The WFPRSS significantly
decreased to 2 ± 2 (n = 27, range, 0–6) (p < .001) and 1 ± 2 (n =
27, range, 0–6) (p < .001) at weeks 4 and 8, respectively.
Except for amputees and patient 22, who was lost to follow–
up, the WFPRSS was 0.2 ± 0.6 (n = 24, range, 0–2) (p < .001) at
week 52 and 0.3 ± 1.7 (n = 23, range, 0–8) (p < .001) at week
260. The serial changes in the WFPRSS are shown in
Figure 2B. All patients experienced rest pain before PuCeT,
and 22 patients experienced complete rest pain relief by week
260. Recurrent ulcers began in patient 6 at week 252, and the
WFPRSS of this patient was 8. The rate of complete pain relief
at week 260 was 81.48% (22/27).
At enrollment, 7 patients had gangrenes and 14 patients had
skin ulcers. And 13 of these 14 patients were completely healed
8 ± 8 months (range, 2–33 months) after therapy. By week
104, there were 2 unhealed cases (patient 6 and 15); these cases
were TAO patients whose ulcers were at the bottom of their feet,
and the ulcer of patient 6 finally healed at week 130. At week
108, patient 24 began experiencing recurrent ulcers and under-
went amputation at week 120; however, patient 6 underwent a
minor amputation at week 252. Therefore, the total healing rate
of ulcers was 85.71% (12/14) at weeks 104 and 260. The serial
changes in ulcer healing rates are shown in Figure 2C. Figure 3
shows the ulcer healing process for patient 18.
Up to December 2016, 5 patients (3, 6, 19, 21, and 24) under-
went a second cell transplantation. Of these 5 patients, 2 patients
(19 and 21) developed a new lesion on the contralateral lower
extremity. Recurrence occurred in patients 3, 6, and 24. Patient
6 developed a new ulcer at a different area of the ipsilateral foot.
Ischemic symptoms reappeared at the same site in patients
3 (unhealed wound after a traffic accident) and 24 (ulcer). Ische-
mic symptoms appeared again on the contralateral limb of patient
25, but this patient did not receive a second transplantation. The
5‐year recurrence rate was 11.11% (3/27), and the re‐transplanta-
tion rate was 18.52% (5/27). Three patients underwent PuCeT
again (3, 6, and 19), while the other 2 (21 and 24) underwent
PBMNC transplantation at other hospitals. Of all 27 patients, only
patient 24 received endovascular intervention on the treated limb
after PuCeT. This patient was treated in the left upper limb and
both lower limbs, all of which were critically ischemic. Similar
symptoms reappeared 6 months later on the left lower limb, and
the patient underwent PTA at another hospital. After PTA, the
ischemia was relieved but reoccurred 21 months later. Patient
24 then received a PBMNC transplantation at another hospital;
however, the procedure was ineffective, and at 120 weeks, the
patient ultimately underwent amputation below the left knee.
Notably, 17 patients (65.38%, 17/26) not only underwent a
successful limb salvage but also fully recovered their labor
competence and returned to their original jobs by week 260.
Results of SF‐36v2 showed a consistent conclusion. The score
of all the eight sections of the questionnaire, including physio-
logical function, role‐physical, bodily pain, general health, vital-
ity, social function, role‐emotional, and mental health, was
significantly improved at week 52 (p < .001) and week 260 (p
< .001) (Fig. 4). Four patients with autoimmune diseases vis-
ited their rheumatologists regularly after PuCeT, and their dis-
eases were well controlled according to their lab reports.
Details regarding the outcomes of the patients with and
without total smoking cessation are shown in Table 2. There
was no significant difference between patients with and with-
out smoking cessation in terms of the major amputation rate,
the PPFWT, the WFPRSS, the ulcer healing rate, or the recur-
rence rate. In addition, a subanalysis (Table 3) was performed
to focus on the TAO patients given that these individuals were
the primary focus of our study (88.89%, 24/27). The results of
this analysis showed similar outcomes in TAO patients com-
pared to the entire cohort.

 WBC counts decreased to normal within 1 week after trans-
plantation in all patients. No pathological angiogenesis was
observed on the fundus oculi.
DISCUSSION
Therapeutic angiogenesis has been considered an innovative
and promising treatment for no‐option CLI. Many studies using
different methods, such as vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)‐related gene transfer [6, 7], bone‐marrow mononuclear
cell (BMMNC) [8–12], PBMNC [13–18], or CD34+ cell [2–4]
transplantation, have been completed and have proven their
safety and efficacy. The long‐term outcome after CD34+ cell
therapy in CLI patients was already reported by Kinoshita
et al. in 2012 [19]. However, there were only 17 patients
enrolled (5 ASO patients and 12 TAO patients) in Kinoshita's
study [19] and the long‐term results elucidating the efficacy
and durability of PuCeT for AICLI remain rare. Our previous
study launched in 2009 assessed the feasibility and short‐term
safety and efficacy of PuCeT in treating CLI patients [4]. At the
beginning of the study, ASO‐induced CLI patients were also
included. However, as the study progressed, we decided to
select AICLI patients, instead of ASO patients, as the priority
targets for the following reasons. First, particularly with the
rapid development of devices and skills for endovascular inter-
vention, surgical and endovascular revascularization demon-
strated higher success rates and better early results in ASO
patients than in AICLI patients. Second, the outcomes in the
three ASO patients we reported on in our pilot study appeared
to be poor [4]. All of the ASO patients underwent major ampu-
tations
within
3
months
after
PuCeT,
similar
to
the
disappointing results from ASO patients in other studies [2, 8].
In contrast, the outcomes of AICLI patients showed extreme
promise. The short‐ and mid‐term results of our study
revealed a favorable limb salvage rate after PuCeT and sug-
gested that a satisfying long‐term outcome could be expected
in certain patients. In addition, given that most of the AICLI
patients were significantly younger and had longer life expec-
tancies, the ideal results of treatment for these patients were
not only limb salvage but also recovery of labor competence
and improvement on the quality of life.
There are numerous revascularization options for AICLI
patients, but the effects are far from satisfactory. Taking TAO
cases as an example, these patients represent the vast major-
ity of AICLI patients and can be treated by many methods,
including surgical bypass, endarterectomy, embolectomy, sym-
pathectomy, superficial vein arterialization, PTA, thrombolysis,
and stenting; however, none of these methods provide ideal
mid‐ to long‐term efficacy. Without cell therapy, the major
amputation rate of TAO patients, including CLI and claudicants,
has been reported to be as high as 12%–31% [20–22]. Ohta
et al. observed that 118 TAO patients presented a total major
amputation rate of 19%; moreover, this study revealed that
the primary patency rates of the surgical bypass subgroup
were 41% (1 year), 32% (5 years), and 30% (10 years), respec-
tively, and the secondary patency rates of this group were
54% (1 year), 47% (5 years), and 39% (10 years), respectively.
Without smoking cessation, the patency rate decreased by
another 50%, and the major amputation rate after bypass
occlusion was 14% [22]. Another study examining 69 TAO
cases showed that the patients suffered from acute ischemia
5.4 times after the initial attack. The 5‐year major amputation
rate was 26%, and 34.8% of the patients lost their ability to
work before the age of 42 years old [20].
The pathological features of AICLI were considered to be
the cause of the poor effect of the conventional revasculariza-
tion methods. First, AICLI frequently involves distal middle and
small vessels and thus destroys the outflow necessary for suc-
cessful endovascular intervention and surgical bypass. Second,
as the predominant form of AICLI, TAO is a type of vasculitis
that is characterized by a highly inflammatory thrombus with
relative sparing of the vessel wall and that is apparently differ-
ent from ASO due to the preservation of the internal elastic
lamina [21]. As a result of these characterizations of TAO, dur-
ing conventional interventions, the guidewire could easily pass
through the lesion, and the balloon could inflate without much
resistance; however, the involved vessel frequently recoils
shortly after surgical intervention. This is unlike ASO lesions,

A Five‐Year Study of PuCeT for AICLI
 (damaged elastic lamina) and plaque‐induced occlusion of the
lumen; as such, these lesions tend to stay open after balloon-
ing and stenting [23]. Third, superficial phlebitis, which was
observed in 40%–60% of TAO cases [24], often damaged the
great saphenous vein that was considered an ideal vascular
graft for the bypass. Finally, the inflammatory nature of AICLI
probably precipitates the intimal hyperplasia after either endo-
vascular or surgical intervention and results in re‐occlusion.
Although there are many treatment options available, tobacco
cessation seemed to be the only successful treatment for
AICLI. Despite this, tobacco cessation failed to reduce the risk
of amputation.
AICLI caused by other etiologies, such as SLE and giant cell
arteritis (GCA), were not as common as TAO and were rarely
reported by other studies focusing on the long‐term outcomes
of stem cell therapy treating CLI [8, 13, 19]. However, the prev-
alence of CLI in these patients is not something to be ignored.
Lie reported that the prevalence of GCA‐induced upper and
lower extremity ischemia was 26% and 18%, respectively [25].
The CLI prevalence in SLE patients was reported to be 1.4% in
a retrospective study of 485 patients, with 71.43% of patients
(5/7) having suffered from digit loss [26].
Thus, it would be meaningful to seek a new, effective and
durable method of revascularization for AICLI patients. Accord-
ing to the 5‐year results of this study, the PPFWT was signifi-
cantly increased, the total pain relief rate was 81.48% (22/27),
the complete healing rate of ulcers reached 85.71% (12/14),
and the MAFS was 88.89% (24/27), which were similar to the
results reported by Kinoshita et al. [19]. Importantly, the qual-
ity of life of the patients was noticeably improved according to
the results of the SF‐36v2 questionnaire. Moreover, 65.38%
(17/26) of the patients fully recovered their labor competence
and returned to their previous employment; however, the
remaining nine patients did not return to work but could live
a physically independent life. The long‐term improvement of
the quality of life is quite important for AICLI patients since
they are significantly younger, but the evaluation of the quality
of life was absent in previous studies [8, 13, 19].
The limitation of the current study was the absence of a
placebo control group, which would have reinforced the
results. A cross‐over design could have provided a suitable
option for a true placebo group. However, the unsatisfactory
outcomes
of
medical,
surgical,
and/or
endovascular
management before PuCeT in all patients could be regarded,
to some extent, as control data. Second, the number of angiitis
patients except those with Buerger's disease was very small in
this study and the sample size was relatively small because it
was based upon the previous pilot study.
CONCLUSION
PuCeT demonstrated long‐term efficacy and durability in treat-
ing AICLI, not only in achieving limb salvage but also in recov-
ering the labor competence and improving the quality of life
of AICLI patients. Confirmation of the conclusion of the current
study is expected in the coming years as additional evidence is
obtained from the long‐term outcomes of a larger number of
patients.
