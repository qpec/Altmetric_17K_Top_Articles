IMPORTANCE Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease. The Mediterranean diet has been
shown to reduce chronic inflammation and has a positive effect on the risk of metabolic
syndrome and cardiovascular events. Thus, we hypothesized a positive effect on the onset
and/or severity of psoriasis.
OBJECTIVE To assess the association between a score that reflects the adhesion to a
Mediterranean diet (MEDI-LITE) and the onset and/or severity of psoriasis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The NutriNet-Santé program is an ongoing,
observational, web-based questionnaire cohort study launched in France in May 2009.
The present study was performed within the framework of the NutriNet-Santé program, with
data collected and analyzed between April 2017 and June 2017. Patients with psoriasis were
identified via a validated online self-completed questionnaire and then categorized by
disease severity: severe psoriasis, nonsevere psoriasis, and psoriasis-free. Data on dietary
intake (including alcohol) were gathered during the first 2 years of participation in the cohort
to calculate the MEDI-LITE score (ranging from 0 for no adherence to 18 for maximum
adherence). Potentially confounding variables (eg, age, sex, physical activity, body mass
index, tobacco use, and a history of cardiovascular disease) were also recorded. Analyses
used adjusted multinomial logistic regression to estimate the risk of having severe psoriasis
or nonsevere psoriasis compared with being psoriasis-free.
RESULTS Of the 158 361 total NutriNet-Santé participants, 35 735 (23%) replied to the
psoriasis questionnaire. The mean (SD) age of the respondents was 47.5 (14.0) years; 27 220
(76%) of the respondents were women. Of these 35 735 respondents, 3557 (10%) individuals
reported having psoriasis. The condition was severe in 878 cases (24.7%), and 299 (8.4%)
incident cases were recorded (those arising more than 2 years after participant inclusion in
the cohort). After adjustment for confounding factors, a significant inverse relationship was
found between the MEDI-LITE score and having severe psoriasis: odds ratio (OR), 0.71; 95%
CI, 0.55-0.92 for the MEDI-LITE score’
s second tertile (score of 8 to 9); and OR, 0.78; 95% CI,
0.59-1.01 for the third tertile (score of 10 to 18).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with severe psoriasis displayed low levels of
adherence to the Mediterranean diet; this finding supports the hypothesis that the
Mediterranean diet may slow the progression of psoriasis. If these findings are confirmed,
adherence to a Mediterranean diet should be integrated into the routine management of
moderate to severe psoriasis.

 P
soriasis is a common chronic inflammatory disease that
affects 1% to 2% of the general population of all ages.1
It is thought that in genetically predisposed individu-
als, psoriasis is triggered by environmental factors that vary
overthecourseoflife,suchastrauma,infections,stress,smok-
ing, and the consumption of certain drugs and alcohol.2 Pa-
tients with psoriasis show a greater prevalence of obesity3 and
metabolic syndrome,4 both of which confer a higher cardio-
vascular risk.5 Inflammation could be the link between pso-
riasis and obesity.3 Diet can play an important role in psoria-
sis.Itincludesmanyproinflammatory(eg,saturatedfattyacids,
heme, iron) and anti-inflammatory (eg, dietary fibers, some
polyphenols) bioactive compounds.6,7 A proinflammatory diet
has been associated with an increase in the incidence and se-
verity of several inflammatory disorders, including inflamma-
tory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid disease.8,9 Further-
more, recent studies have shown that adherence to a healthy
diet (such as the Mediterranean diet) may reduce the risk of
long-term systemic inflammation10 and thus the risk of meta-
bolic syndrome,11 cardiovascular events,12 and other chronic
inflammatory diseases.12 The Mediterranean diet is charac-
terized by a high proportion of fruits and vegetables, le-
gumes, cereals, bread, fish, fruit, nuts, and extra-virgin olive
oil,whichisanimportantsourceofmonounsaturatedfattyacid
(MUFA). The consumption of meat, dairy products, eggs, and
alcohol is low to moderate.13 One possible explanation for the
Mediterranean diet’
s ability to reduce chronic, systemic in-
flammation relates to the anti-inflammatory properties of di-
etary fibers, antioxidants, and polyphenols—all significantly
present in the Mediterranean diet.14 The association between
the Mediterranean diet and a lower incidence of chronic in-
flammatory diseases (eg, atherogenesis, rheumatoid arthri-
tis, Crohn disease) has also been supported by intervention
studies.10,15,16
These dietary factors might also have an effect on the on-
set and/or severity of psoriasis. A review of the literature sug-
gests that a diet rich in anti-inflammatory nutrients reduces
the severity of psoriasis.17 Indeed, it has been previously re-
ported that a low consumption of MUFA is the main predictor
of the clinical severity of psoriasis; MUFA might act as an ad-
junctive mechanism to decrease inflammation in patients with
psoriasis.18 Several studies have also reported that vitamin D
may play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis owing to its
role in proliferation and maturation of keratinocytes.19 In fact,
moststudieshaveevaluatedtheroleofindividualfoodsand/or
nutrients (rather than a particular overall diet or healthy life-
style) in the development of psoriasis.20
The objective of the present study was therefore to assess
the association between a score that reflects the adhesion to a
rather anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet (the MEDI-LITE
score21) and the onset and/or severity of psoriasis.
Methods
Study Population and Design
The present study was performed within the framework of the
NutriNet-Santé program, an ongoing, observational, web-
based cohort study launched in France in May 2009. Partici-
pants 18 years or older with access to the internet are eligible
for the cohort. All questionnaires are completed online using
a dedicated website (https://www.etude-nutrinet-sante.fr/).
TheNutriNet-Santéstudy’
srationale,design,andmethodology
have been described elsewhere.22 In brief, NutriNet-Santé
participantsprovideinformationonsociodemographiclifestyle
andanthropometricfactors,healthstatus,physicalactivity,and
diet at the time of enrollment in the cohort and each year
thereafter. The NutriNet-Santé study is being performed in
accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, and
all procedures have been approved by the institutional review
board at the French National Institute for Health and Medical
Research and the National Data Protection Commission. All
participants gave their electronic, informed consent.
Case Ascertainment
A specific, validated, 11-item, online self-questionnaire on pso-
riasis was distributed to the whole NutriNet-Santé cohort
(158 361 participants) on January 10, 2017 (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).23Theparticipants’responsesenabledustoiden-
tify cases of psoriasis and assess disease severity when pres-
ent. We also identified incident cases of psoriasis (defined as
those arising more than 2 years after inclusion in the cohort),
to evaluate the participants’MEDI-LITE scores before the on-
set of psoriasis.
Participants were classified into 3 groups: severe psoria-
sis, nonsevere psoriasis, and no psoriasis. The definition of se-
vere psoriasis was based on both physicians’reports and pa-
tients’ outcomes: a history of hospitalization, the use of
systemic medications, a self-rating of “very severe” or “se-
vere” disease, and a self-rating of a “very severe” or “severe”
impact on quality of life.
Dietary Data Collection and MEDI-LITE Score Computation
Dietary intakes were assessed every 6 months through a se-
ries of 3 nonconsecutive, validated, web-based, 24-hour di-
etary records, randomly assigned over a 2-week period.24-26
Participants reported all foods and beverages consumed dur-
ing a 24-hour period.21,27,28 For each participant, we calcu-
lated the average consumption (in grams per day) for the food
Key Points
Question Is there an association between the adherence to an
anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet and the onset and/or
severity of psoriasis?
Findings This prospective, web-based questionnaire study of
35 735 respondents from the French NutriNet-Santé cohort, of
whom 3557 had psoriasis, found a statistically significant inverse
association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and
severity of psoriasis, after adjustment for sociodemographic
variables and confounding factors including age, sex, physical
activity, body mass index, tobacco use, educational level, a history
of cardiovascular disease, and depression.
Meaning The Mediterranean diet may slow the progression of
psoriasis, so an optimized diet should be part of the
multidisciplinary management of moderate to severe psoriasis.

 groups of interests (fruits, vegetables, legumes, meat, fish,
cereals, olive oil, and dairy products), macronutrient and mi-
cronutrient intakes (vitamins A, C, D, and E; manganese;
selenium; zinc; fiber; carbohydrates; lipids; proteins; ω-3
[omega-3], and ω-6), and alcohol intake. A Mediterranean diet
adherence score (MEDI-LITE) was calculated for each partici-
pant using the average of 3 to 15 dietary records gathered
during the first 2 years after inclusion. MEDI-LITE was devel-
oped by Sofi et al21 in 2014 and is based on a large-scale meta-
analysis of cohort studies of the link between the Mediterra-
neandietandhealthstatus.TheMEDI-LITEscorewasvalidated
in2017bycomparingitsmetrologicalcharacteristicswiththose
of the previously validated and widely used MedDietScore.29
The MEDI-LITE score ranges from 0 (no adherence) to 18
(full adherence) and includes 3 different categories of con-
sumption (1 for each food group composing the Mediterra-
nean diet).
Data Collection for Covariates
At baseline and during follow-up, self-questionnaires
were used to collect information on sociodemographic,30
anthropometric,31,32 lifestyle, and medical factors: sex, age,
educational level, smoking habits, body mass index (BMI; cal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared),physicalactivity(asassessedbytheInternationalPhysi-
cal Activity Questionnaire),33 medication use, a history of car-
diovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, acute coro-
narysyndrome,coronaryarteryangioplasty,transientischemic
attack,orstroke),diabetes,hypertension,hypertriglyceridemia,
IBD, and depressive symptoms (defined as a Center for Epide-
miologicStudiesDepressionScale[CES-D]score≥16;theCES-D
was incorporated into the NutriNet-Santé study in 2016).
Statistical Analysis
Quantitative variables were reported as median (interquar-
tile range) or mean (SD). Qualitative variables were reported
as the number (percentage) of participants. The characteris-
tics of the participants who completed the psoriasis question-
naire were compared with those of the participants who did
not reply (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Unadjusted comparisons among the severe psoriasis, non-
severe psoriasis, and no psoriasis groups were based on an
analysis of variance for quantitative variables and on the χ2 test
for qualitative variables. Multinomial logistic regression mod-
els with the MEDI-LITE score as the main exposure were ad-
justed for patient-related covariates (in tertiles, ranging from
minimum to maximum adherence; tertile 1, a MEDI-LITE score
of 0-7; tertile 2, a score of 8-9; tertile 3a score of 10-18). Analy-
sis was performed on the basis of 4 models:
•Model 1, adjusted for age and sex;
•Model 2, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, physi-
cal activity, and educational level;
•Model 3, adjusted for age, sex BMI, smoking status, physical
activity, educational level, and baseline history of cardiovas-
cular disease, diabetes, hypertension, and hypertriglyceri-
demia; and
•Model 4, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, smoking status, physi-
cal activity, educational level, and baseline history of car-
diovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyc-
eridemia, and depressive symptoms.
The results of the multivariable analyses for the MEDI-
LITE score were presented as continuous variables and (as-
suming that the nonlinear hypothesis held true) in tertiles.
Sensitivity Analyses
To minimize selection bias, the sensitivity analyses (1) in-
cluded only participants with physician-diagnosed psoriasis
and (2) excluded those with other diseases with a predeter-
mined genetic basis similar to that of psoriasis and known to
be related to diet (eg, IBD and/or ongoing systemic treatment
with methotrexate, acitretin, cyclosporine, and/or biologics).
To limit classification bias, the second sensitivity analy-
sis included only participants with severe psoriasis who re-
ported a history of hospitalization and/or the use of systemic
therapy.
Finally, we restricted our analyses to incident cases of pso-
riasis; this limited the influence of confounding factors that
may have modified dietary behavior after the diagnosis of pso-
riasis and that had not been taken into account in our final
model.
The threshold for statistical significance was set at P < .05.
All analyses were performed with SAS software (SAS Enter-
prise Guide, version 7.1, SAS Institute Inc).

 cept that the nonresponder group had a younger mean age
and a higher proportion of active smokers (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Data on the MEDI-LITE score and the different food groups
and nutrients were available for 30 882 patients. The 4853 par-
ticipants with missing data (corresponding to 13.6% of the re-
sponders) had recently joined the cohort and thus lacked suf-
ficient dietary records; accordingly, they were excluded from
the analyses. The groups of included and excluded persons did
not differ significantly with regard to sociodemographic char-
acteristics and comorbidities (ie, age, sex, BMI, physical ac-
tivity,smokingstatus,educationallevel,healthstatus,andper-
sonal medical history; data not shown).
A total of 3557 patients indicated that they had psoriasis,
corresponding to 10.0% of the responders, and 2.2% of the
whole NutriNet-Santé population. Of the 3557 patients with
psoriasis, 878 (corresponding to 24.7%) reported severe pso-
riasis and 299 (8.4%) had incident psoriasis (arising more than
2 years after inclusion in the cohort).
Factors Associated With the Severity of Psoriasis
The results of the univariate analyses are summarized in
Table 2. Patients with severe psoriasis had a higher risk of hav-
ing a MEDI-LITE score of 0 to 7 (first tertile, low adherence to
the Mediterranean diet) (n = 339; 46%) compared with pa-
tientswithnoseverepsoriasis(n = 839;36%)andpatientswith
no psoriasis (n = 9915; 36%). As detailed in Table 2, associa-
tions were also noted for sex, BMI, smoking status, physical
activity, educational level, cardiovascular disease, hyperten-
sion, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and depression.
In a multivariable analysis, the MEDI-LITE score was sig-
nificantly and inversely associated with the severity of pso-
riasisinmodels1,2,and3(supportingdatareportedinTable3).
There was also an association found in model 4, but the asso-
ciation was not statistically significant (Table 3). Participants
with severe psoriasis had a lower MEDI-LITE score (ie, less ad-
herence to the Mediterranean diet) than participants with non-
severe psoriasis and psoriasis-free participants.
Sensitivity Analyses
The results of the multivariable analyses were similar when
we considered only patients participants diagnosed with pso-
riasis by a physician (whether a dermatologist or not; n = 2655
cases of psoriasis, including 712 severe cases) or a dermatolo-
gist in particular, (n = 1755, including 566 severe cases), and
excluded participants with IBD and/or systemic treatment
(sample: 731 severe psoriasis, 2275 nonsevere psoriasis, and
27571psoriasis-freeparticipants).Likewise,similarresultswere
obtained when the definition of severe psoriasis was based
solely on a history of hospitalization and/or systemic therapy
for psoriasis (sample: n = 441). Finally, a multivariable analy-
sisofthe299casesofincidentpsoriasisyieldedmuchthesame
odds ratios as the analysis of the total population (eTable 3 in
the Supplement).
Discussion
The present study of the MEDI-LITE score revealed an in-
verse association between adherence to the Mediterranean
diet and the severity of psoriasis. This association was still
present after adjustment for sociodemographic variables,
history of cardiovascular disease, and depression. Thus, pa-
tients with severe psoriasis adhered less strongly to the Medi-
terranean diet; this finding may support the hypothesis that
the Mediterranean diet is associated with less severe psoria-
sis (as proven for other inflammatory diseases).15,16
To our knowledge, only 1 study has reported an associa-
tion between psoriasis and the Mediterranean diet. In a cross-
sectionalstudy,Barreaetal34foundanassociationbetweenthe
adherence to the Mediterranean diet on one hand and the se-
verity of psoriasis (as assessed by the Psoriasis Area and Sever-
ity Index) and serum C-reactive protein levels on the other. In-
deed, the proportion of individuals with low adherence to the
Mediterranean diet was higher in a group of patients with pso-
riasisthaninapsoriasis-freecontrolgroupmatchedforage,sex,
and BMI. However, the study’
s design and small sample size
(n = 62 patients with psoriasis) constitute major limitations.34
Our present results from a cross-sectional observational
study neither prove the existence of a direct, causal relation-
ship between psoriasis and diet nor provide mechanistic in-
formation on the relationship. However, a number of hypoth-
eses can be justifiably considered.
First, a proinflammatory diet might trigger psoriasis. The
results of a recent study emphasized the major impact of nu-
trition on the immune system.35 The lymphoid organs and the
cells of the immune system (most of which are present in the
gastrointestinal tract) are directly influenced by the environ-
ment in general and food in particular, from embryogenesis
onwards. Notably, polyunsaturated fatty acids, ω-3 fatty ac-
ids, folates, and vitamins A, D, and E may have a special role
by virtue of their anti-inflammatory actions.14,17 Further-
more, a specific diet may alter the intestinal microbiota and

 thus promote inappropriate immune responses (eg, altera-
tion of the T-regulatory cell–T helper cell type 17 balance) that
can trigger digestive and systemic autoimmune diseases. In
managing IBD, an anti-inflammatory diet with high probiotic
and ω-3 contents might be of value because of its direct ac-
tion on the intestinal microbiome.8 Also, diet can alter the ex-
pression of various immunity-related genes through epige-
netic modification; this constitutes an additional link between
the environment, nutrition, and disease.35 Changes in West-
ern diets over recent decades (eg, to include highly processed
foods that are low in micronutrients) might explain the in-
creased incidence of allergic, inflammatory, and autoim-
mune diseases.35 In the present study, there seems to be an in-
verse association between MEDI-LITE score and severity of
incident cases of psoriasis. The absence of significance could
be explained by a lack of power: of the 299 incident cases of
psoriasis, severe psoriasis was limited to 69.
Second, a proinflammatory diet might aggravate psoria-
sis. It is already known that consumption of a proinflamma-
tory diet is linked to an increased risk of obesity and metabolic
syndrome36—both of which are associated with more severe
psoriasis37 and a higher cardiovascular risk. A growing body of
evidencesupportsthepresenceofmultipleassociationsamong
obesity, metabolic syndrome, and psoriasis, and there is prob-
ably a bidirectional association between obesity and psoriasis.3
Indeed,theseveritiesofpsoriasis,metabolicsyndrome,andsys-
temic inflammation are interrelated. For example, Vadakayil et
al38 have reported higher serum C-reactive protein levels in pa-
tients with severe psoriasis and/or metabolic syndrome. Fur-
thermore, more severe systemic inflammation may be associ-
atedwithhighbloodpressure,thedysregulationofbloodlipids,
and disorders of carbohydrate metabolism—all of which would
aggravate the symptoms of psoriasis.39 Hence, in patients with
psoriasis, a proinflammatory diet would probably accentuate
systemicinflammationandworsentheskinlesions.Inlinewith
thishypothesis,severalinterventionalstudieshaveshownthat
dietary measures can decrease the severity of psoriasis.14,17,40
Third, psoriasis might directly and causally alter eating be-
havior.Thispotentialreversecausalitybiascannotbeexcluded
in the present study owing to the cross-sectional design of
the survey. Environmental factors (such as sociodemographic
factors and depression) are known to have an impact on diet
quality.41Inthepresentstudy,ourmultivariateanalysestookac-
count of the main confounding factors and did not modify the
resultsofunadjustedanalysis.However,otherconfoundingfac-
torsmayhavebeenpresent.Indeed,publishedstudiesoftheas-
sociationbetweenpsoriasisandvariousfoodsandnutrients14,15
mightinducepatientstomodifytheireatingbehaviors—despite
the absence of formal guidelines. In a recent study,42 1206 pa-
tientswithpsoriasisfilledoutadietaryquestionnaire;86%ofthe
participants stated that they had changed their diet (eg, with a
decrease in alcohol and carbohydrate intakes, and an increase
in fruit, vegetable, and vitamin D intakes) to improve their skin
condition.
Strengths and Limitations
The present study had a number of strengths and limita-
tions. The strengths include the large sample in NutriNet-
Santé cohort and the high accuracy of the food records.
Indeed, food consumption was evaluated through at least
3 food surveys and a large food database (with more than
3300 items); this allowed intra-individual variability to be
taken into account.43
The fact that NutriNet-Santé participants are all volun-
teers may limit the present results’generalizability; the co-
hort participants are likely to be more concerned about their
health status than the general population. However, 87% of
the NutriNet-Santé participants having reported psoriasis
statedthatthishadbeendiagnosedbyaphysician,whichmini-
mizes classification bias. Furthermore, the psoriasis question-
naire used in the present study was derived from a self-
questionnaire with known, validated metrological properties;
in the previous study,23 patients who reported “having a pso-
riasis” and “it was diagnosed by a physician” accurately re-
ported their diagnosis, with high sensitivity (93%) and speci-
ficity (98%). The prevalence of psoriasis was estimated at 2.2%
(n = 3557 out of 158 361), assuming that the participants who
did not reply did not have a psoriasis; such prevalence is ex-
pected in a French population.1 The association between se-
verepsoriasisandlowadherencetotheMediterraneandietper-
sisted after adjustment for known confounding factors, thus
minimizing residual confounding bias. The severity of psoria-
sis was defined using both usual physicians’assessment (hos-
pitalization and systemic treatment for psoriasis) and pa-
tients’self-reported severity. However, similar results were
obtained when the definition of severe psoriasis was based
solely on a history of hospitalization and/or systemic therapy
withpsoriasismedications,thusminimizingclassificationbias.
Nevertheless,theproportionofmissingdatafordepressionwas
high (37%): the CES-D score that we took into account was in-
corporated into the NutriNet-Santé program in 2016 and thus
was not administered to all participants. We did not use a mul-
tiple imputation method because of the high proportion of
missing data (37%).44
Conclusions
In conclusion, the present results suggest an inverse associa-
tionbetweenaMediterranean(anti-inflammatory)dietandthe
severity of psoriasis. This association was independent of a
numberofsociodemographicvariablesandconfoundingmedi-
cal factors. Further prospective observational studies and ran-
domized clinical trials are needed to confirm these results, and
experimentaldataareneededtoestablishthemechanisticlinks
between psoriasis and diet. If these findings are confirmed, an
optimized diet should be part of the multidisciplinary man-
agement of moderate to severe psoriasis, with a view to in-
creasing therapeutic effectiveness.
