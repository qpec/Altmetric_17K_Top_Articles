Background/Aims: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by airway inflam-
mation, in which contributes to loss of lung function. Systemic inflammation is also a feature of COPD
contributing to many associated co-morbidities. Statins, omega-3 fatty acids (docosahexanoic acid, DHA
and eicosapentanoic acid, EPA) and lycopene have been shown to decrease systemic inflammation;
however their combined effects have not been investigated. This study aims to identify changes in
systemic and airway inflammation induced by statins alone or in combination with DHA, EPA and
lycopene in COPD.
Methods: COPD patients (n ¼ 11) received rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) for 4 weeks, then a combination of
rosuvastatin (20 mg/day), DHA and EPA (1.5 g/day) and lycopene (45 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Blood and
sputum were collected and lung function measured by spirometry at baseline, week 4 and 12. Plasma
fatty acids were measured using gas chromatography, while plasma carotenoids were analysed using
high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma CRP and IL-6 concentrations were measured using
ELISA; and peripheral blood gene expression was measured using the nCounter™ GX Human Inflam-
mation Kit 2.
Results: Following the interventions, clinical characteristics and plasma IL-6 and CRP were unchanged.
Sputum neutrophil proportion and absolute count was increased and macrophage proportion decreased
by rosuvastatin (P ¼ 0.020 and P ¼ 0.015; respectively). Rosuvastatin increased LTB4R and decreased
CXCL10 and AGER gene expression in white blood cells. The addition of lycopene and omega-3 fatty acids
decreased LTB4R and increased CXCL10 to basal levels, whilst combined use of interventions increased
ALOX15 blood gene expression.
Conclusion: This study shows that rosuvastatin, omega-3 fatty acids and lycopene have some anti-
inflammatory effects systemically, but rosuvastatin may increase airway neutrophils, which would be
undesirable in COPD patients, warranting further investigation.

1. Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently
suffered by 1.2 million Australians and is expected to rise to 2.6
million by the year 2050 [1]. COPD is primarily caused by smoking
and is most prevalent in the elderly population [2]. It is charac-
terized by airway inflammation, resulting in small airway remod-
elling as well as destruction of lung parenchyma, fibrosis of airways
and loss of lung elasticity resulting in irreversible airflow obstruc-
tion [3e5]. Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress are also key
features of COPD [6,7].
Systemic inflammation involves elevated acute phase proteins,
including C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and
surfactant protein (SP)-D [8e10], and inflammatory mediators
including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1b and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-
a [11]. Systemic inflammation is thought to be the cause of many of
the co-morbidities that are related to COPD [12], such as cardio-
vascular disease, diabetes and cachexia [13]. Oxidative stress also
occurs in COPD, as reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by
activated inflammatory cells in both the airways and circulation

 and cause damage to lipids, proteins and DNA [7]. Systemic markers
of oxidative stress that are elevated in COPD, include malondial-
dehyde (MDA), 8-isoprostane, protein carbonyls and oxidised low-
density lipoprotein (oxLDL) [14e16]. COPD subjects have also been
found to generally have lower circulating levels of antioxidants,
which is an indirect marker of oxidative stress [17].
Current therapies for COPD reduce symptoms, decrease fre-
quency and severity of exacerbations as well as increasing exercise
capacity [18], yet systemic inflammation and/or oxidative stress
persist [19]. Interventions that are prescribed for COPD patients
include bronchodilators, corticosteroids, long-term oxygen therapy
and pulmonary rehabilitation [18]. Novel therapies targeting sys-
temic inflammation and oxidative stress include 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or
statins, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids [20,21]. Previous
studies have examined the use of statins, and antioxidants indi-
vidually in COPD as well as other chronic inflammatory diseases,
while omega-3 fatty acids have been investigated for their anti-
inflammatory mechanism [20e24].
Statins have anti-inflammatory properties [20,25] and have
been shown to reduce markers of systemic inflammation including
IL-6, TNF-a and CRP in cardiovascular disease as well as animal
models of cigarette smoke exposure [26e28]. Antioxidants such as
lycopene, vitamin C and vitamin E have been previously studied in
COPD and have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and
inflammation [17,21,23,29]. Lycopene has been found to reduce
ROS, IL-8 and MMP-9 in THP-1 macrophages exposed to cigarette
smoke [30,31] as well as increasing antioxidant enzymes, SOD and
catalase, and decreasing inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-a and IL-
1b in COPD patients [29]. Omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) have been shown to have
anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of the NLRP3 inflam-
masome [24]. To date there are no studies that have been published
on the effects of omega-3 supplementation alone in COPD, however
a number of studies have been registered and are currently un-
derway. DHA can decrease inflammatory and oxidative stress
markers in mouse models of fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes
[24,32], while the combined use of EPA and DHA in healthy par-
ticipants decreases inflammatory gene expression in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [33]. To date, the combined ef-
fects of statins, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids in COPD have
not been investigated. We hypothesised that antioxidants, statins
and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in combination would
reduce airway and systemic inflammation in COPD.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
Thirteen subjects with COPD, aged 35 years and over were
recruited. COPD was defined as a doctor's diagnosis as well as
having an FEV1/FVC ratio <2 standard deviations below expected
for their age, gender and height. Subjects were ex-smokers with a
smoking history of at least 10 pack years and had stopped smoking
for at least 12 months prior to commencing the study. Subjects
were excluded from the study if they had a respiratory disorder
other than COPD, had a moderate exacerbation of COPD in the
previous month or a severe exacerbation in the previous 3 months,
were
receiving
long-term
oral
corticosteroid
therapy,
were
currently taking statins or had any chronic disease other than
COPD.
2.2. Intervention
Subjects participated in an interventional study, of sequential
design, with subjects given rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) (AstraZeneca,
London, England) for the first 4 weeks of the trial. Following this,
subjects were then given a combined intervention for 8 weeks
consisting of rosuvastatin (20 mg/day), fish oil (3 g/day; EPA
1055.1 mg, DHA 744.9 mg) (Blackmores, balgowlah, Australia) and
lycopene (45 mg/day) (LycoRed, Beer Sheva, Israel) as illustrated in
Fig. 1. Subjects completed clinic visits at weeks 0, 4 and 12. At every
visit, pulmonary function testing and St George's Respiratory
Questionnaire [34] were completed, sputum was induced and
blood samples were taken. Unused drugs and supplements were
collected at each visit to determine adherence with the interven-
tion. Participants with adherence of >80% were included in the
analysis, determined by the pill count back method [35].
2.3. Clinical assessment
Pre and post bronchodilator lung function was assessed using
standardised spirometry (KoKo Spirometer, Pulmonary Data Ser-
vice, Instrumentation Inc., Louisville, USA) according to ATS rec-
ommendations [36]. Spirometric classification of severity of COPD
was done according to GOLD criteria and based on post broncho-
dilator FEV1 as recommended by the GOLD guidelines [37].
2.4. Sputum induction and processing
Sputum induction was performed with hypertonic saline (4.5%),
however 0.9% saline was substituted for subjects with FEV1<40%.
Participants inhaled nebulised saline at 30sec, 1 min, 2 min and
3 � 4 min intervals for a maximum time of 15.5 min. If FEV1 fell
by � 15% from baseline, subjects were administered salbutamol and
the saline challenge was stopped if FEV1 did not return to within
10% of baseline. Participants were asked to produce a sputum
sample which was processed as previously described [38]. For
sputum inflammatory cell counts, selected sputum was dispersed
using dithiothreitol (DTT) and a total cell count and cell viability
were performed. Cytospins were prepared, stained (May-Grunwald
Giemsa) and a differential cell count obtained from 400 non-
squamous cells.
2.5. Blood cholesterol analysis
Fasting blood cholesterol measurement was carried out by
Hunter Area Pathology Service (HAPS). This included total choles-
terol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides.
2.6. Carotenoid assessment
High-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure
plasma carotenoid concentrations, including lycopene, a- and b-
carotene, lutein/zeaxanthin and b-cryptoxanthin [39] as previously
described [40]. Ethanol:ethyl acetate (1:1) containing an internal
standard
(canthaxanthin)
and
butylated
hydroxytoluene
was
added to the sample. The solution was centrifuged (3000g, 48 �C,
5 min) and the supernatant was collected, this was repeated 3
times adding ethyl acetate twice and then hexane to the pellet.
Ultrapure water was then added to the pooled supernatant fluid,
and the mixture was then centrifuged. The supernatant was then
decanted and the solvents were evaporated with nitrogen. The
sample was then reconstituted in dichloromethane:methanol (1:2).
Chromatography was performed on a hypersil ODS column with a
flow rate of 0.3 mL/min, using mobile phase of acetonitrile:di-
chloromethane:methanol 0.05% ammonium acetate (85:10:5). Ca-
rotenoids were detected at 450 nm using a photodiode array.

 2.7. Fatty acid analysis
Total fatty acids were measured by using the method of Lepage
and Roy [41] as previously described [42]. A methanol-to-toluene
mixture (4:1, by vol), containing C13:0 and C19:0 (0.02 g/L) and
BHT (0.12 g/L) was added to plasma. Fatty acids were methylated by
adding acetyl chloride drop by drop while mixing by vortex, then
heating the sample to 100 �C for 1 h. After cooling, the reaction was
stopped by adding 6% K2CO3. The sample was centrifuged at 3000g
for 10 min at 4 �C to facilitate the separation of layers. The upper
toluene layer was used for gas chromatography analysis of the fatty
acid methyl esters by use of a 30 m � 0.25 mm fused carbon-silica
column (DB-225) that was coated with cyanopropylphenyl (J & W
Scientific, Folsom, CA). Both the injector and detector port tem-
peratures were set at 250 �C. The oven temperature was initially set
at 170 �C for 2 min, was increased 10 �C/min until the temperature
of 190 �C was reached and held for 1 min, at which point the
temperature was then increased 3 �C/min until the temperature of
220 �C was reached and maintained, giving a total run time of
30 min. A split ratio of 10:1 and an injection volume of 5 mL were
used. The chromatograph was equipped with a flame ionization
detector, auto-sampler, and auto-detector. Sample fatty acid methyl
ester peaks were identified by comparing their retention times
with those of a standard mixture of fatty acid methyl esters and
were quantified by using a Hewlett Packard 6890 series gas chro-
matograph with Chemstations software (version A.04.02; Palo Alto,
CA) for gas chromatographic analysis.
2.8. Inflammatory mediator analysis
Plasma IL-6 was measured using the Human IL-6 Quantikine HS
ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) as per
manufacturer's instructions. Plasma high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP)
was measured by Hunter Area Pathology Service from serum mixed
with monoclonal antibody-coated polystyrene particles, specific for
human CRP (CRP Flex reagent cartridge, Dimension Vista System,
Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. Newark USA).
2.9. Gene expression analysis
RNA was extracted from whole blood using the QIAamp RNA
blood mini kit protocol as per manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). Erythrocyte lysis was performed on EDTA blood
and the resulting white blood cell pellet was lysed in buffer RLT
(with 0.01% 2-mercaptoethanol) and stored at �80
�C until
extraction. The column based RNA extraction was performed using
an automated QIAamp RNA blood mini kit protocol (QIAcube,
Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the addition of an on column DNase
digestion. After washing with a reduced volume of RW1 buffer, RNA
bound to the QIAamp membrane was treated with DNase I. DNase I
was then removed by a second RW1 Buffer wash, washed with RPE
Buffer and RNA was eluted. RNA quality and concentration was
determined using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Assay with the
Agilent Bioanalyser 2100. Digital expression of inflammatory genes
was measured using the nCounter Human Inflammation Kit
Version 2 (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, United States of
America), which measures the expression of 255 genes. This con-
sisted of 249 genes which are known to be differentially expressed
during inflammation and 6 internal reference genes (CLTC, GAPDH,
GUSB, HPRT1, PGK1 and TUBB). Digital gene expression was ana-
lysed as per manufacturer's instructions.
2.10. Statistical analysis
Per protocol statistical analyses was performed in STATA IC 11
(STATA corporation, College Station, Texas, United States), using the
repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test (normally
distributed data) or Friedman's test with Dunn's post-hoc test (non-
parametric data). Gene counts from the nCounter data were first
normalised using the geometric means of the housekeeping genes
GAPDH, HPRT1 and PGK1 using the nSolver software package
provided by NanoString Technologies. The three housekeeping
genes were chosen using NormFinder as previously described [43],
this was done to determine the most stable housekeeping genes
across the samples. Genes that had mean mRNA counts of <20
across all visits were excluded due to low expression levels, genes
were also classified as nearing significance if 0.1 > p � 0.05. Para-
metric data is presented as mean ± standard error of the mean
(SEM), while non-parametric data is presented as median (quartile
1, quartile 3). Data was assessed for normality using the D'Agostino-
Pearson omibus normality test [44]. Correlations between variables
were examined using Pearson's correlation coefficient (normally
distributed data) or Spearman's correlation coefficient (non-para-
metric
data).
P-values
<
0.05
were
considered
statistically
significant.
This was a pilot study aimed at determining the efficacy of these
supplements in modifying inflammatory pathways. Hence no pri-
mary outcome was nominated. A power calculation using any of the
classical markers of systemic inflammation demonstrates the study
was underpowered to detect a difference. For example, to detect a
20% change in CRP (0.6 mg/L) with SD ¼ 5 mg/L, we would require
n > 2000.
2.11. Ethics
Ethics for this study was approved by Hunter New England
Health (reference number 11/02/16/3.08). The study was also
registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
(ANZCTR) e Registration number ACTRN12611000165987.
Fig. 1. Study design for the anti-inflammatory intervention. Rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) was given over 12 weeks from week 0 to week 12, while fish oil (1.5 g/day) and lycopene
(45 mg/day) were given over 8 weeks from week 4 to week 12 of the study.

 3. Results
13 participants commenced the intervention study and 2
withdrew, hence 11 participants completed the study. One of the
withdrawn patients suffered bloating on day 5 of the study and
itchiness all over by day 10, while the other withdrew from the
study due to muscle aches and pains after visit 2. The clinical
characteristics of the 11 subjects who completed the intervention at
baseline (visit 1), after statin treatment (visit 2) and after combined
statin, lycopene and fish oil treatment (visit 3) are presented in
Table 1.
3.1. Clinical characteristics and blood lipids
No clinical characteristics were found to be significantly
different between the visits, this included lung function, quality of
life, BMI and blood pressure. Total Cholesterol, LDL-Cholesterol and
Total Cholesterol/HDL ratio were decreased after statin treatment
(Table 1). No additional effect was seen with the nutritional
interventions.
3.2. Nutritional biomarkers
The nutritional biomarkers including plasma fatty acids and
carotenoids are detailed in Table 2. The supplemented fatty acids,
DHA (22:5n-6) and EPA (C20:5n-3) were increased at visit 3
compared to visit 1 and 2. Saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated
fatty acids, total polyunsaturated fatty acids and total fatty acids
were all found to decrease between visits 1 and 3. Treatment in-
terventions did not significantly change plasma carotenoid levels.
However there was a trend for increased lycopene concentration at
visit 2 and 3.
3.3. Systemic inflammatory biomarkers
Peripheral blood and induced sputum inflammatory cell counts
and plasma IL-6 and CRP levels before and after each intervention
are detailed in Table 3. Peripheral blood cell counts remained
similar after the interventions, except for red blood cells which
decreased at visit 3 following the combined rosuvastatin, lycopene
and fish oil intervention (Table 3).
3.4. Airway inflammatory biomarkers
Interestingly, the percentage and absolute counts of sputum
neutrophils were increased at visit 2 following rosuvastatin inter-
vention, however this did not reach significance until visit 3 after
combined statin, fish oil and lycopene intervention (Table 4, Fig. 2).
The percentage of macrophages in sputum were decreased after
visit 2 after rosuvastatin intervention but this also did not reach
significance until visit 3 following the combined statin, fish oil and
lycopene intervention (Table 4).
3.5. Peripheral blood gene expression
Amongst the 255 genes that were measured, there were 5 genes
significantly differentially expressed between the visits (Fig. 3),
with 15 genes nearing significance (Table 5). LTB4R expression
significantly increased after statin treatment, however LTB4R
expression subsequently decreased with the addition of fish oil and
lycopene to the treatment regimen. CXCL10 gene expression
significantly decreased after statin treatment, but increased after
the addition of fish oil and lycopene (Fig. 3). AGER gene expression
significantly decreased from visit 1 to visit 2 and ALOX15 was found
to significantly increase from visit 1 to visit 3 (Fig. 3). RIPK2 was also
found to be differentially expressed during the study, however

4. Discussion
This study examined the effect of a novel anti-inflammatory
intervention on systemic inflammation in COPD. During the study
total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and the total cholesterol/HDL
ratio decreased with rosuvastatin treatment as well as combined
rosuvastatin, lycopene and fish oil intervention. These results are
expected with the use of statins and confirm that participants
complied with the treatment [45]. Markers of systemic inflamma-
tion (plasma IL-6 and CRP) however, were found to be unchanged
throughout the course of the study. Previous studies have found
that statins have decreased IL-6 and CRP in both rats exposed to

study. The mRNA counts of LTB4R (A), CXCL10 (B), AGER (C), and ALOX15 (D) were determined to be differentially expressed after the treatment interventions. The expression of
LTB4R was found to be increased after statin treatment and decreased after the combined use of statins, fish oil and lycopene. CXCL10 expression was decreased by statin treatment
and increased after the combined use of statins, fish oil and lycopene. AGER was decreased by the use of statins alone. ALOX15 was found to be increased after the combined use of
statins, fish oil and lycopene. *P < 0.005.

 tobacco smoke and in humans with Cardiovascular disease (CVD)
[27,28,46]. Previous studies have also reported that lycopene sup-
plementation (20 mg/day, 4 months) reduced plasma IL-6 in COPD
[29] and lycopene (15 mg/day for 8 weeks) reduced plasma CRP in
healthy men [47]. These previous reports do not align with the
results of this study, which suggests that neither statins, nor the
combined use of statins, fish oil and lycopene lower systemic
inflammation. While the current study may have been too short in
duration or underpowered to detect a change in classical markers
of systemic inflammation, our data provides no convincing evi-
dence of a systemic anti-inflammatory effect.
In the current study sputum neutrophils were increased, and
sputum macrophages decreased after the combined rosuvastatin,
lycopene and fish oil treatment. The increase in sputum neutrophils
was seen with 4 weeks of rosuvastatin alone, but did not reach
statistical significance until the end of the combined intervention. A
previous study on patients with atopic asthma also found that
giving atorvastatin (40 mg/day) along with inhaled corticosteroids
increased neutrophils and decreased macrophages in sputum when
compared to the placebo group [48]. Other in vitro studies however,
have found that the use of pravastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin
on neutrophils isolated from blood impairs their ability to migrate
Fig. 4. Graphs of significant correlations between Sputum and blood neutrophil and genes significantly changed by the anti-inflammatory interventions. LTB4R gene expression was
positively correlated to sputum neutrophil counts at baseline (A), while change in LTB4R expression between visits 1 and 3 of the study was positively correlated with changes in
sputum (B) and blood (C) neutrophils between visits 1 and 3. Change in AGER gene expression was positively correlated with change in sputum (D) and blood (E) neutrophil count
between visits 1 and 3, change in ALOX15 gene expression was also positively correlated to change in blood (F) neutrophils between visits 1 and 3. The correlations of A and B were
calculated using Pearson's correlation, while CeF were calculated using Spearman's correlation for nonparametric data.

 [49]. Lycopene has previously been found to reduce sputum neu-
trophils in non-eosinophilic asthma [50], and neutrophils found in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice with ovalbumin induced
asthma [51]. Similarly, a number of previous studies have found
that the use of fish oil attenuates neutrophil function, including
chemotaxis [52,53]. Hence it appears likely that the increased
neutrophils observed after intervention in our study are due to the
rosuvastatin treatment. The clinical importance of this observation
requires further investigation, as an ongoing increase in neutro-
philic inflammation in the airways of COPD patients may have
adverse consequences in those taking rosuvastatin.
5 genes were significantly changed between the three visits of
the intervention study. These genes included LTB4R, CXCL10, AGER,
RIPK2 and ALOX15. LTB4R is the receptor for leukotriene B4, and acts
as a neutrophil chemoattractant [54]. During the study LTB4R was
increased by statins, however the combined use of statins, fish oil
and antioxidants lowered LTB4R back to basal levels. No previous
studies have looked at LTB4R expression with statin treatments, but
a previous study has shown high doses of atorvastatin had no effect
on LTB4 protein levels [55], while another study found that ator-
vastatin inhibited the 5-lipoxygenase pathway involved in LTB4
production [56]. Fish oil has been shown to reduce production of
LTB4, via substitution of DHA and EPA for arachidonic acid in cell
membranes, which results in production of LTB5 instead of LTB4
[57,58].
Our
study
suggests
that
rosuvastatin
increases
the
expression of LTB4 receptor, thus stimulating an increase in neu-
trophils, while the addition of fish oil may have subsequently led to
a decrease in LTB4 gene expression, back to baseline levels.
CXCL10, also known as IP-10, is a chemoattractant for activated
T-lymphocytes and is produced by neutrophils [59]. CXCL10 gene
expression was decreased with statin treatment, however this
returned to basal levels with fish oil and lycopene supplementa-
tion. Previous studies have seen that the use of fluvastatin and
atorvastatin reduces CXCL10 levels systemically, which supports
the results seen in the current study [60,61]. However, it is un-
known why addition of lycopene and fish oil reverses this effect, as
these nutrients have previously been shown to also reduce CXCL10
[62,63].
Advanced glycation end products (AGE) are produced when
reduced sugars react with the amino groups of proteins forming
reversible Schiff bases and then amadori products, undergoing
complex reactions to become cross-linked fluorescent protein de-
rivatives [64]. AGE receptor (AGER, or RAGE) has been shown to
interact with AGEs [65]. AGER is involved in the activation of a
number of inflammatory genes, such as NF-kB regulated pathways,
as well as being important in a number of chronic inflammatory
diseases [66]. AGER was found to be significantly decreased after
treatment with rosuvastatin. Previous studies have shown that
pravastatin and simvastatin can reduce AGER [64,65], as well as
reducing NF-kB signalling suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory
mechanism of statins [67,68].
Receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein-kinase 2 (RIPK2)
is a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) containing kinase [69],
and has previously been implicated in NF-kB signalling and
inducing cell death [70]. The results of this study show that statins
may increase RIPK2, while lycopene and fish oil may decrease its
expression. No previous studies have found an association with
RIPK2 and the use of statins, lycopene or fish oil. RIPK2 may be
involved in the innate immune response of neutrophils. Decreased
RIPK2 expression has been shown to result in decreased neutrophil
chemokine and cytokine expression [71]. This may explain the
differential expression of RIPK2 in this study, and its possible
relationship to the increase in airway neutrophils.
ALOX15 encodes the enzyme arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (15-
LO), which metabolizes arachidonic acid to yield peroxidised
products that are then reduced, or converted enzymatically, to form
12-hydroxyeicosatetraeonic acid (12-HETE) [72]. 12-HETE is known
to be a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils [72]. ALOX15
expression was increased after the statins, lycopene and fish oil
intervention. No previous studies have looked at ALOX15 expression
and the use of these interventions, however one study has seen that
DHA may be a substrate for 15-LO forming neuroprotectin D1
(NPD1) [73], which exerts a negative feedback system to control
oxidative stress as well as up regulating Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic pro-
teins and inhibition of the production of pro-inflammatory eicos-
anoids such as prostaglandin [73]. The increase in ALOX15 may also
have contributed to the increase in neutrophils seen between visit 1
and 3, as a previous study found that knocking out ALOX15 reduced
neutrophil recruitment in an acute lung injury model in mice [72].
Several correlations were seen between the changes in the
expression of genes LTB4R and ALOX15 and the changes in the
proportion or count of neutrophils in the airways and blood be-
tween baseline and after rosuvastin/combined treatment. These
results suggest that the changes in these genes seen in the study
may be related to the increase in neutrophils seen between visit 1
and 2/3. This is expected, as both LTB4R and ALOX15 have been
previously shown to play an important role in the recruitment of
neutrophils [54,72]. As the primary change that we observed in
inflammation in this study was an increase in sputum neutrophils,
this suggests that the changes in expression of these genes domi-
nated the inflammatory changes in this study.
There are several limitations to this study. In particular, the
intervention study was a pilot study with only 11 participants.
While we have seen some important effects on neutrophilic airway
inflammation and associated gene changes, a larger study cohort is
required to determine whether these effects are clinically impor-
tant, particularly in light of previous studies which have found that
the use of simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin and fluvastatin have
been associated with reduced decline in lung function in patients
with COPD, ex-smokers and current smokers [74,75].
Another limitation of the study is the sequential study design,
which does not allow us to determine whether the effects seen
between visits 1 and 3 and visit 2 and 3 are from the combined use
of rosuvastatin, lycopene and fish oil or whether they are an effect
of long term statin use or just an effect of lycopene and fish oil
supplementation. Another potential limitation of this study was
that patients ranged from mild to severe COPD; this may play a role
in the changes seen as the effect of these treatments may vary with
disease severity. During the study, plasma DHA and EPA were
increased after supplementation, at visit 3 compared to visit 1 and
2. However, plasma lycopene was not significantly changed be-
tween any of the visits of the study. It is unknown why this
occurred and suggests that either the participants were not
adherent, or the bioavailability of the supplement was poor.
However, the latter is unlikely, as the bioavailability of the sup-
plement used has been previously confirmed [76,77]. The use of a
0.05 significance level for the gene analysis may also be seen as a
potential limitation for this study, as there were a large number of
genes assessed for expression. A more conservative p-value could
have been used, however this would have reduced the power of the
study to detect any changes in gene expression following the in-
terventions due to our small sample size.
In summary, this study has shown that rosuvastatin, fish oil and
lycopene may have some anti-inflammatory effects systemically,
but rosuvastatin may also have pro-inflammatory effects, leading to
increased
airway
neutrophilic
airway
inflammation.
Further
investigation of the effects of rosuvastatin on clinical outcomes in
COPD is needed. Investigation of alternative forms of statins is also
warranted, as other statin drugs may not have the same undesir-
able effect on airway inflammation observed with rosuvastatin.

 There still remains a need for alternative anti-inflammatory treat-
ments in COPD, hence additional studies of potential treatments is
needed.
