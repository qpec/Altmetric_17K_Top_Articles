Viral infections have been proposed to elicit pathological processes leading to the
initiation of T helper 1 (TH1) immunity against dietary gluten and celiac disease (CeD). To
test this hypothesis and gain insights into mechanisms underlying virus-induced loss of
tolerance to dietary antigens, we developed a viral infection model that makes use of
two reovirus strains that infect the intestine but differ in their immunopathological
outcomes. Reovirus is an avirulent pathogen that elicits protective immunity, but we
discovered that it can nonetheless disrupt intestinal immune homeostasis at inductive and
effector sites of oral tolerance by suppressing peripheral regulatory T cell (pTreg)
conversion and promoting TH1 immunity to dietary antigen. Initiation of TH1 immunity to
dietary antigen was dependent on interferon regulatory factor 1 and dissociated from
suppression of pTreg conversion, which was mediated by type-1 interferon. Last, our study
in humans supports a role for infection with reovirus, a seemingly innocuous virus, in
triggering the development of CeD.
C
eliac disease (CeD) is a complex immune
disorder with an autoimmune component
in which genetically susceptible individuals
expressing the human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) DQ2 or DQ8 molecules display an in-
flammatory T helper 1 (TH1) immune response
against dietary gluten present in wheat (1–3). The
HLA-DQ2– or HLA-DQ8–restricted TH1 response
against gluten is central to CeD pathogenesis and
thought to precede development of villous atro-
phy (4). However, epidemiological and immuno-
logical observations support a role for additional
genetic and environmental factors in CeD patho-
genesis. Similar levels of wheat consumption and
expression of CeD-predisposing HLA molecules
can be accompanied by striking differences in CeD
prevalence (1). A remarkable example supporting
aroleforenvironmentalfactorsisthehighfrequen-
cy of CeD in Finnish Karelia (>2%), which con-
trasts with the low incidence of CeD in the adjacent
Russian republic of Karelia (0.2%), two neighbor-
ing regions harboring genetically similar popula-
tions. Furthermore, the incomplete digestion of
gluten by intestinal enzymes (2, 5) explains why
gluten would be conducive to inducing intestinal
T cell responses. However, it does not explain why
CeDpatientsdevelopagluten-specificTH1response
instead of a regulatory immune response, the de-
fault intestinal immune reaction to orally ingested
protein, characterized by the induction of periph-
eral regulatory T cells (pTregs) expressing the tran-
scription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) (6).
Viral infection experimental model using
genetically engineered reoviruses
Despite epidemiological evidence of associations
between viral infections and the initiation of CeD
(1),experimentalevidenceislacking.Previousstudies
have implicated adenovirus, enteroviruses, hepa-
titis C virus, and rotavirus as triggers of CeD (7, 8).
However, little is known about the mechanisms
by which viruses evoke the disease. Viruses in the
family Reoviridaeare segmented, double-stranded
RNA (dsRNA) viruses that infect humans fre-
quently throughout their lifetime (9). Mammalian
Orthoreovirus(reovirus)strainsisolatedfromhumans
can infect mice via the oral route and activate in-
nate immune pathways similar to the related rota-
virus (10, 11). Two human reovirus isolates, type
1 Lang (T1L) and type 3 Dearing (T3D), differ in
replication biology, apoptosis induction, innate im-
mune response activation, cellular tropism, and
pathogenesis (11). Furthermore, T1L infects the
intestine and perturbs intestinal immune home-
ostasis (11, 12), whereas T3D is incapable of infect-
ingtheintestine(11).Onthebasisofthefundamental
differences between T1L and T3D, we hypothe-
sized that engineering a T3D reassortant virus
capable of intestinal infection would yield two vi-
ruses with potentially different effects on toler-
ance to dietary antigen. Therefore, we recovered a
T3D reassortant virus called T3D-RV by introduc-
ing the S1 and L2 gene segments of T1L into a
T3D genetic background, thus allowing the virus
to infect the intestine (fig. S1A) (13). Such reas-
sortants arise naturally (10, 11) and can be readily
recovered in the laboratory by using reverse ge-
netics (11). We first established that the two vi-
ruses are similar in their capacity to replicate (fig.
S1B) and infect the intestine (fig. S1, C and D). Fur-
thermore, both viruses are cleared (fig. S1E)without
inducing intestinal damage (fig. S1F). Although
both viruses induced high antireovirus antibody
titers, antibody levels observed after T1L infection
were significantly higher than those after T3D-RV
infection (fig. S1G). However, comparison of the
host T cell response in sham- and virus-infected
mice revealed that T1L and T3D-RV induced sim-
ilar TH1 responses in Peyer’s patches (PP) (fig. S1H),

Reovirus T1L infection promotes
inflammatory immunity to
dietary antigen
Having established that the two strains infect and
induce protective immunity in PP, we next inves-
tigated whether they affect immune responses to
dietary antigens at inductive and effector sites of
oral tolerance—mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN)
and lamina propria (Lp) (14, 15), respectively. We
took an unbiased approach, using transcriptional
profiling to compare and contrast the dynamics
of the virus-host interaction across multiple sites
of the gut. The application of an unsupervised ap-
proach incorporating minimum spanning trees
(MSTs)(16,17)andmultidimensionalscaling(MDS)
ordination (Fig. 1A) revealed transcriptional pro-
file clusters that were strongly driven by differ-
ences in location (epithelium, Lp, PP, and mLN)
and were influenced by reovirus infection in a
location- and time-dependent manner, which is con-
sistentwithourunderstandingofmucosalimmunity
and intestinal structure and function. This strong
location effect was directly evident and predomi-
nantly captured by dimension 1 in the MDS scal-
ing operation, which together with dimension 2
also captured the virus-dependent differences. At
the early time point (6 hours), both viruses have
similar effects primarily on PP and the epithelial
compartment (primary sites of infection) (12) and
no effect on mLN (Fig. 1A). In contrast, at 48 hours,
the viruses altered the transcriptional profile of
mLNandLp(inductiveandeffectorsitesofimmune
responses to dietary antigens) (14, 15), and response
differences between the two viruses emerged (Fig.
1A). We therefore followed up this observation
with in-depth factorial design analyses (FDAs)
(fig. S2) to identify host genes that were differen-
tially expressed in response to the two viruses,
characterizing their expression in a time- and
location-dependent manner. In both Lp and mLN
at 48 hours, we observed a strong enrichment of
immune,defense,andantiviralresponsepathways,
including type-1 interferon (IFN) signaling, among
genes that were differentially expressed after T1L
or T3D-RV infection (fig. S3). Additionally, in mLN,
the differential response to the viruses was also
characterized by an overrepresentation of cytokine
and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase sig-
naling pathways, as well as pathways associated
withnutrientresponse,stress,andvesicle-mediated
transport (fig. S3). The finding that T1L induced
more extensive transcriptionalchanges (inthenum-
ber and level of genes induced) in mLN and Lp at
48 hours compared with that of T3D-RV (Fig. 1A
and figs. S2 to S4) raised the possibility that T1L
might alter the response to dietary antigen.
To test this hypothesis, we first determined the
effect of in vivo reovirus infection on mLN dendrit-
iccells (DCs). TheCD103+ CD11b–DCsubset has the
highest tolerogenic potential (18, 19) but also drives
TH1 responses to intestinal infections (20–22). T1L
induced more IL-12p40 than did T3D-RV in CD103+
CD11b– CD8a+ DCs (Fig. 1B), which was the sub-
set that exhibited the highest level of ovalbumin
(OVA) uptake after oral administration, irrespec-
tive of the virus used (fig. S5, A and B). However,
both viruses induced similar levels of IL-12p40 in
resident CD103– CD11b– CD8a+ DCs (fig. S5C),
whereas no up-regulation of IL-12p40 was detect-
able in the other mLN DC subsets (fig. S5D).

at inductive and effector sites of the gut. (A) For each time point, WT mice were inoculated
perorally with 1010 plaque forming units (PFU) of T1L (n = 3 mice; red circles), 1010 PFU of T3D-RV (n =
3 mice; blue circles), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (sham, n = 3 mice; open circles) and
euthanized 6 or 48 hours after inoculation. RNA of mLN, PP

of T3D-RV (n = 6 mice), or PBS (sham, n = 5 mice) for 2 days. The expression of IL-12p40 on gated
MHC-II+ CD11c+ CD103+ CD11b− CD8a+ mLN DCs was evaluated by means of flow cytometry.
Representative dot plots and percentages of IL-12p40 in the mLN are shown in the CD103+ CD11b–

day after transfer, mice were inoculated perorally with 1010 PFU of T1L (n = 4 to 16 mice), 1010 PFU of
T3D-RV (n = 5 to 14 mice), or PBS (sham, n = 6 to 15 mice) and fed 1.5% OVA in the drinking water (filled

 Furthermore, T1L up-regulated more substan-
tially the costimulatory molecule CD86 as well as
transcripts of interleukin-27 (IL-27), a cytokine
produced by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that
promote TH1 immunity (fig. S5, E and F) (23, 24).
Havingfoundthat T1L, but not T3D-RV, induces
a proinflammatory phenotype in DCs that take up
OVA, we next investigated the effect of the two reo-
viruses on the T cell response to dietary antigen
usinganinvivoTcell conversionassay(fig. S6A).In
accordance with its capacity to alter the tolerogen-
ic phenotype of CD103+ CD11b– DCs, T1L infection
significantly inhibited the conversion of OVA-
specific OT-II CD4+ T cells into pTregs and instead
promotedtheirdifferentiationintoT-bet+andIFNg+
CD4+ T cells in mLN and Lp, respectively (Fig. 1, C
and D, and fig. S6, B to D). In contrast, T3D-RV
neither markedly blocked the induction of pTregs
nor induced TH1 immune responses against die-
tary OVA (Fig. 1, C and D, and fig. S6, B to D).
Although T1L and T3D-RV differed in their capac-
ity to interfere with responses to dietary antigens,
they induced similar host TH1 responses to viral in-
fections in mLN and Lp (fig. S7, A to D).
Oral tolerance is defined as the establishment
ofperipheralimmunetolerancethroughoraladmin-
istration of antigen and is thought to be depen-
dent on the induction of pTregs (6). As expected, T1L
but not T3D-RV prevented induction of peripheral
tolerance upon oral administration of OVA (fig. S7,
E to G). Collectively, these results suggest that as
aconsequenceofT1L-hostinteractions,thetolerogenic
response to dietary antigens is abrogated and, in-
stead, TH1 immunity to dietary antigens is induced.
Distinct host pathways block induction
of pTregs and induce TH1 immunity to
dietary antigen
We next sought to determine the mechanistic ba-
sis for the differential effect of T1L and T3D-RV
infection on the response to dietary antigen. Type-
1 IFNs are up-regulated in CeD and have been
suggested to explain development of TH1 immuni-
ty against dietary gluten (25). RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) analysis of mLN from wild-type (WT)
mice and mice in which type-1 IFN receptor has
been knocked out (IFNAR−/−) 48 hours after T1L
and T3D-RV infection revealed that among the
285 genes found to be differentially expressed be-
tween T1L- and T3D-RV–infected mice, 200 genes
were regulated in a type-1 IFN-dependent manner
(fig. S8), 58 were partially type-1 IFN–dependent,
and 27 were type-1 IFN–independent, as assessed
with FDA to examine differences in expression
response. Further analysis in mLN confirmed that
T1L induced higher levels of canonical type-1 IFN-
inducible genes such as Mx1 and Isg15 than did
T3D-RV (Fig. 2A and fig. S9A). This result was
contrary to the in vitro data (fig. S9, B to D) and
the reported capacity of T1L but not T3D to inter-
fere with type-1 IFN signaling (26), suggesting
that yet-to-be-determined differences in virus-
host interactions displayed by T1L and T3D-RV
can lead to alternative outcomes in mLN in vivo,
and that type-1 IFN may be responsible for ini-
tiating TH1 immunity against dietary antigen in
T1L-infected mice. To assess this possibility—butto
avoid confounding factors associated with uncon-
trolled T1L replication in the absence of type-1 IFN
signaling (27)—we analyzed DCs and OVA-specific
T cell conversion at 48 hours, a time point at
which viral titers in the ileum are similar in WT
and IFNAR−/− mice (fig. S9E). Surprisingly, al-
though CD86 was notinducedinIFNAR−/−CD103+
CD11b– CD8a+ DCs (fig. S9F), up-regulation of IL-
12p40 in DCs (Fig. 2B and fig. S9G) and Il27 mRNA
in mLN (fig. S9H) occurred after T1L infection,
suggesting that type-1 IFNs are not required for
acquisition of an inflammatory phenotype by
mLN APCs. Consistent with these findings, T1L
infection induced comparable T-bet expression in
OVA-specific CD4+ T cells in WT and IFNAR−/−
mice (Fig. 2C and fig. S9I). At this early time
point, neither Foxp3 nor IFN-g can be detected in
OVA-specific T cells in the mLN. To assess the
role of type-1 IFN in pTreg conversion, an in vivo
OT-II T cell conversion assay was performed in
WT and IFNAR−/− mice injected intraperitoneally
with the dsRNA analog polyinosinic:polycyti-
dylic acid [poly(I:C)]. As shown in Fig. 2, D and
E, and fig. S10, A to B, dsRNA was sufficient to
block pTreg conversion in a type-1 IFN–dependent
manner. Furthermore, type-1 IFNs blocked pTreg
conversion comparable with infection with T1L
(fig. S10C). In contrast, poly(I:C) (Fig. 2, F and G,
and fig. S10D) and type-1 IFN (fig. S10C) were
unable to promote TH1 immunity.
To define the mechanism underlying T1L-
induced TH1 immunity to dietary antigen, we inter-
rogated the mLN RNA-seq data from T1L- and
T3D-RV–infected WT and IFNAR−/− mice more
deeply in order to identify genes that were differ-
entially expressed in a type-1 IFN–independent
manner, using FDA (fig. S11A). IL-15, previously
shown to prevent pTreg conversion and induce TH1
immunity to dietary antigens (28), was not up-
regulated after T1L infection in mLN of IFNAR−/−
mice (fig. S11B). In contrast, interferon regulatory
factor 1 (IRF1)—a transcription factor regulated
at the transcriptional level (29) and implicated in
multistage regulation of TH1 immune responses
(30)—was significantly up-regulated after T1L
infection in both WT and IFNAR−/− mice (Fig. 3A
and fig. S11A). IRF1 was a particularly intriguing
candidate because it is up-regulated in the mucosa

 of children with CeD (31). To determine wheth-
er IRF1 is required in T1L-mediated immuno-
pathology, we analyzed DCs and OT-II T cell
conversion in IRF1−/− mice. Viral titers were
similar at 48 hours and 6 days after infection in
WT and IRF1−/− mice (fig. S11, C and D), enabling
us to analyze the response to dietary antigen after
oral OVA administration at these two time points.
We found that IL-12p40 (Fig. 3B and fig. S11E)
and to a lesser extent CD86 (fig. S11F) showed
significantly less induction in IRF1−/− mice relative
to WT mice. Additionally, induction of Il12b and
Il27 mRNA expression was significantly impaired
in IRF1−/− mice (fig. S11, G and H). Consistent
with preserved type-1 IFN up-regulation after T1L
infection in IRF1−/− mice (fig. S11, I and J), absence
of IRF1 failed to restore pTreg conversion (Fig. 3, C
and D, and fig. S11K). However, whereas type-
1 IFN signaling was dispensable at 48 hours (Fig.
2C), IRF1 was required for T1L-mediated TH1
immunity to oral antigen 48 hours (fig. S11, L to
N) and 6 days (Fig. 3, E and F, and fig. S11O) after
OVA feeding. This result is consistent with the role
of IL-12 and IL-27 in TH1 immunity (23, 30, 32) and
the abrogation of their up-regulation in IRF1−/−
mice (Fig. 3B and fig. S11, G and H). Knowing
that the T cell conversion experiments were per-
formed by using OT-II T cells that were IRF1-
proficient, we next investigated a role for IRF1 in
DCs by performing in vitro T cell conversion assays
with mLN DCs isolated 48 hours after T1L in-
fection of WT and IRF1−/− mice. Because IRF1 de-
ficiency skews differentiation of DC subsets (33),
we adjusted the relative proportion of the main
mLN DC subsets of IRF1−/− mice to approximate
that of WT mice (fig. S12, A and B). In keeping with
a critical role for IRF1 in DCs, we found that mLN
DCs from T1L-infected mice failed to promote TH1
cell differentiation in the absence of IRF1 expres-
sion (fig. S12, C and D). Our studies cannot elimi-
nate a potential T cell–intrinsic function of IRF1
in virus-mediated pTreg blockade (34). Further-
more, and in accordance with the defect in IL-12
induction observed in vivo (Fig. 3B and fig. S11G),
IL-12 production was impaired in IRF1−/− mLN
DCs relative to that in WT mLN DCs (fig. S12E).
Last, in support of a direct role for IL-12 in T1L-
mediated TH1 immunity to oral antigen, we found
that blocking IL-12 in vitro impaired the capacity
of T1L-infected WT mLN DCs to convert OT-II T
cells into TH1 cells (fig. S12, C and D). These re-
sults are in agreement with studies reporting
that IRF1 functions in TH1 immunity and IL-12
induction (32, 35). Last, in addition to IL-12, IRF1
is required for IL-27 up-regulation in vivo (fig.
S11H), suggesting that it may also participate in
the induction of TH1 immunity to dietary antigen
upon T1L infection.
Taken together, our studies analyzing the ef-
fect of T1L on the response to dietary antigen us-
ing OVA as a model antigen (fig. S13) suggest that
two reovirus strains can induce similar antiviral
TH1 responses in PP and yet display distinct im-
munopathological properties. We show that T1L,
but not T3D-RV, promotes an inflammatory phe-
notype in DCs taking up dietary antigen. In addi-
tion, our results indicate that type-1 IFN signaling
and IRF1 up-regulation are differentially impli-
cated in blocking pTreg conversion and promoting
TH1 immunity to dietary antigen after T1L infec-
tion. IRF1 functions in T1L-induced TH1 immuni-
ty to dietary antigen by promoting IL-12 and IL-27
in DCs. Although type-1 IFNs are not required (Fig.
3A), they likely contribute to IRF1 up-regulation
(36) after reovirus infection in WT mice.
T1L infection breaks oral tolerance to
gluten and induces TG2 activation in
DQ8tg mice
To determine the relevance of these findings to
CeD, we analyzed the effect of T1L infection in
transgenic mice expressing the CeD-predisposing
HLA molecule DQ8 (DQ8tg mice) (28). First, we
confirmed that Irf1 was up-regulated in DQ8tg
mice after T1L infection (Fig. 4A). Next, we verified
that like OVA-fed WT mice (Fig. 1B and fig. S5B),
gluten peptideswere preferentiallyfound inCD103+
CD11b– CD8a+ DCs after gavage of sham- or T1L-
infected DQ8tg mice (fig. S14, A to C). This DC
subsetup-regulatedIL-12p40(Fig.4Bandfig.S14D)
and CD86 (fig. S14E). The pattern of IL-12p40 ex-
pression in the other mLN DC subsets of DQ8tg
mice was alsosimilar tothat inWT mice (fig. S14F).
In addition, Il27 was up-regulated (fig. S14G). In
agreement with mLN DCs acquiring a proinflam-
matory phenotype, T1L infection induced loss of
oral tolerance to gluten in DQ8tg mice as assessed
by the presence of anti-gliadin IgG2c antibodies

 hypersensitivity reaction (Fig. 4D and fig. S14H).
In addition to intestinal environmental conditions
favoring TH1 immunity against dietary antigens,
transglutaminase 2 (TG2) activation is thought
to promote CeD pathogenesis by increasing the
affinity of gluten peptides for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-
DQ8 molecules (1–3) through posttranslational
modifications. T1L infection induced TG2 ac-
tivation, as quantified by incorporation of 5-
(biotinamido)-pentylamine (5BP),a small-molecule
TG2 activity probe, in more than 60% of infected
DQ8tg mice (Fig. 4E) without inducing detect-
able intestinal damage. Thus, in a CeD-relevant
mouse model, T1L infection breaks oral tolerance
to gluten and promotes TG2 activation, sup-
porting the hypothesis that reovirus infection,
despite being clinically silent, can initiate critical
events that set the stage for development of CeD.
Evidence for a role of reovirus infection
in celiac disease
To directly investigate a role for reovirus in CeD,
we compared anti-reovirus antibody titers in con-
trol individuals with those with active CeD and
CeD patients on a gluten-free diet (GFD). CeD pa-
tients tended to have higher anti-reovirus anti-
bodytiters(P=0.06)(Fig. 5A)andweresignificantly
overrepresented among patients with very high
titers(Fig.5B).Furthermore,CeD patientsonaGFD
with high anti-reovirus titers (above the median of
our samples) have significantly higher IRF1 levels
in the small intestinal mucosa compared with that
of individuals with low anti-reovirus titers (Fig.
5C). However, there was no direct correlation
between the anti-reovirus antibody titers and the
level of IRF1 expression, indicating that there is
not a linear relationship between antibody titers
and IRF1 levels. Together, these results suggest
that the presence of anti-reovirus antibody titers
above a certain threshold indicates an antecedent
virus-host interaction that caused long-lasting
changes in immune homeostasis associated with
high IRF1 expression. This hypothesis is in
agreement with the concept that viruses may
leave a permanent mark on the transcriptional
program of the host (37) and is consistent with
our observation that mice infected with T1L have
higher antibody titers than those of mice infected
with T3D-RV (fig. S1G), which does not disrupt
tolerance to dietary antigens, unlike T1L. A link
between rotavirus infection and development of
CeD was suggested in a longitudinal study in chil-
dren (8). However, our study failed to show such
an association (Fig. 5, D to F). Our results do not
exclude a role for rotavirus in CeD pathogenesis
and could be explained by rotavirus-host immune
interactions that differ from those observed with
reovirus and hence do not lead to the same im-
mune signatures. Last, high anti-reovirus anti-
body titers in CeD patients did not correlate with
either high anti-rotavirus (Fig. 5G) or high anti-
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) antibody titers
(Fig. 5H), indicating that CeD patients displaying
high anti-reovirus antibody titers do not mount
generally high antibody responses against viruses.
Taken together, these results suggest that reovirus
infection can trigger the onset of CeD in a subset
of CeD patients.
Conclusion
This study provides support for the concept that
viruses can disrupt intestinal immune homeosta-
sis and initiate loss of oral tolerance and TH1 im-
munitytodietary antigen.Furthermore, ourfindngs
suggest that an avirulent pathogen, such as reovi-
rus, which issuccessfully cleared from the infected
host, can nonetheless promote immunopatholo-
gy. In support of this idea, clinically silent norovi-
rus infections increasesusceptibilitytodevelopment
of colitis (38). Our data also indicate that two vi-
ruses belonging to the same species can have sub-
stantially different immunopathological effects.
Analysis of the transcriptional profiles induced in
response to T1L and T3D-RV suggests that the ca-
pacity of a virus to trigger the loss of oral tolerance
is associated with its capacity to disrupt immune
homeostasis at sites where responses to oral
antigens are initiated (fig. S13).
In addition to reovirus, it is probable that other
enteric viruses, including viruses belonging to
families detected by different immune sensors

trigger loss of tolerance to dietary antigen. Ex-
panding the concept of virotypes (37), we propose
that viruses eliciting proinflammatory immune
responses to dietary antigen alter immune ho-
meostasis and in particular endow DCs with
proinflammatory properties at sites where oral
tolerance is induced (fig. S13). Identification of
other viruses and defining key common features
of virus-host interactions leading to the abroga-
tion of oral tolerance will help to design vaccine
strategies to prevent CeD and possibly other
autoimmune disorders in at-risk populations. On
the basis of our findings, even viruses that do not
lead to overt clinical pathology could be candi-
dates for such prophylactic intervention.
CeD is a complex disorder that likely requires
several environmental perturbations to permanent-
ly disrupt tolerance to gluten. Indeed, epidemiolo-
gical studies longitudinally monitoring genetically
at-risk children report transient anti-gluten im-
mune responses before development of fully de-
veloped CeD (39, 40) and suggest that anti-gluten
antibodies precede anti-TG2 antibodies (41). Fur-
thermore, induction of TH1 immunity to gluten,
although required, is insufficient to cause villous
atrophy, both in humans and mouse models of
CeD (42–44). Our study indicates that although
reovirus infections may trigger development of
TH1 immunity to gluten as well as activation of
TG2, additional events will be required for induc-
tion of anti-TG2 antibodies and villous atrophy.
Furthermore, nonviral triggers, such as pathoge-
nic members of the microbiota (45, 46), may have
disease causing properties similar to reovirus, and
the combination of different types of environ-
mental factors likely will eventually lead to forma-
tion of a memory pool of TH1 anti-gluten T cells of
sufficient magnitude to cause enduring CeD with
villous atrophy.
