Objective: Previous
studies
have
reported
reduced
cortical thickness and surface area and altered gyrification
in frontal and temporal regions in adolescents with
conduct disorder (CD). Although there is evidence that the
clinical phenotype of CD differs between males and fe-
males, no studies have examined whether such sex dif-
ferences extend to cortical and subcortical structure.
Method: As part of a European multisite study (Fem-
NAT-CD), structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
data
were
collected
from
48
female
and
48
male
participants with CD and from 104 sex-, age-, and
pubertal-status�matched controls (14–18 years of age).
Data were analyzed using surface-based morphometry,
testing for effects of sex, diagnosis, and sex-by-diagnosis
interactions, while controlling for age, IQ, scan site, and
total gray matter volume.
Results: CD was associated with cortical thinning and
higher gyrification in ventromedial prefrontal cortex in
both sexes. Males with CD showed lower, and females
with CD showed higher, supramarginal gyrus cortical
thickness compared with controls. Relative to controls,
males with CD showed higher gyrification and surface
area in superior frontal gyrus, whereas the opposite
pattern was seen in females. There were no effects of
diagnosis or sex-by-diagnosis interactions on subcortical
volumes. Results are discussed with regard to attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, and substance
abuse comorbidity, medication use, handedness, and CD
age of onset.
Conclusion: We found both similarities and differences
between males and females in CD–cortical structure as-
sociations. This initial evidence that the pathophysiolog-
ical basis of CD may be partly sex-specific highlights the
need to consider sex in future neuroimaging studies and
suggests that males and females may require different
treatments.
Key words: conduct disorder, antisocial behavior, sex
differences, brain structure, surface-based morphometry

C
onduct disorder (CD) is a psychiatric disorder
that emerges in childhood or adolescence and
is
characterized
by
aggressive
and
antisocial
behavior.1 It incurs major costs for affected individuals, their
families, and society in general.2 Neurodevelopmental the-
ories of CD propose that dysfunction in a set of cortical and
subcortical brain regions causes increased vulnerability to
antisocial
behavior
and
aggression.3
The
regions
that
have received most attention are those implicated in
emotion processing, empathy, decision making, and rein-
forcement learning, such as the amygdala, anterior insula,
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and striatum.3
Amygdala dysfunction is argued to lead to impairments in
stimulus-reinforcement learning, which may be particularly
influential during socialization because the individual fails
to learn the connection between their aggressive acts and the
distress cues (e.g., sad expressions) displayed by others.4 The
anterior insula is implicated in processing aversive stimuli as
well as awareness of one’s own and others’ affective and
physiological states5-6; consequently, insula dysfunction may
lead
to
empathy7
and
interoception
deficits.
Striatal
dysfunction is thought to cause deficits in prediction error
signaling, which would mean that the individual is less
sensitive to discrepancies between the predicted and actual
outcomes of their actions, thereby disrupting their ability to
learn from reinforcement.3 Finally, vmPFC dysfunction
could lead to difficulties in representing the value of stimuli,
which may impair effective decision making.3,8
In addition to these regions, there is increasing evidence
that CD is associated with superior temporal and anterior
and posterior cingulate cortex dysfunction, which may
disrupt social cognitive and self-referential processing.9,10

 Recent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) meta-
analyses
have
supported
these
neurodevelopmental
models by confirming that individuals with CD have lower
gray matter volume (GMV) in many of these regions,
including the amygdala, anterior insula, vmPFC, and supe-
rior temporal cortex.11
Although the lifetime prevalence of CD is up to 10 times
higher in males than in females,12-14 it is nevertheless one of
the most common disorders in adolescent females,15 and one
of the main reasons for referral to child and adolescent
mental health services.16,17 CD presents in different ways in
males and females; males with CD display higher levels of
aggression18 but lower levels of comorbid disorders, such as
depression,19 and are more likely to develop antisocial per-
sonality disorder in adulthood.13 Furthermore, there seem to
be quantitative differences between males and females in
vulnerability to risk factors.20 It has been suggested that fe-
males may require a higher loading of genetic or environ-
mental
risk
in
order
to
develop
CD.21
Relating
this
differential threshold theory to the neuroimaging context,
one prediction is that females who do surpass the threshold
for a CD diagnosis may show more pronounced brain ab-
normalities than their male counterparts, which would be
reflected in sex-by-diagnosis interactions.
Very few imaging studies have investigated sex differ-
ences in CD, and such studies have yielded inconsistent and
inconclusive results. This is likely due to an underrepre-
sentation of female participants in these studies22 and hence
insufficient power to detect sex-by-diagnosis interactions.
There
is
preliminary
evidence
that
CD
is
associated
with reductions in amygdala23 and orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC)/vmPFC GMV24 in both males and females. In
contrast, one study found reduced anterior insula volume in
females with CD relative to female controls, but the reverse
effect
in
males.23
Furthermore,
a
negative
association
between CD severity and superior temporal cortex GMV
was reported in females but not in males.25
The current study addressed the lack of reliable evidence
regarding possible sex differences in CD-related structural
abnormalities by including a large, balanced sample of male
(n ¼ 48) and female (n ¼ 48) adolescents with CD and
similar-sized typically developing control groups. We used
surface-based morphometry (SBM), which, in contrast to
voxel-based morphometry
(VBM), distinguishes
among
different cortical properties with distinct etiologies and
developmental trajectories,26 namely, cortical thickness (CT),
surface area (SA), and gyrification (i.e., the amount of cortex
folded within a sulcus compared to outside the sulcus).
Although CT and SA display inverted-U trajectories across
childhood and adolescence (peaking at 8.5 and 9 years,
respectively), gyrification peaks in infancy and decreases
over childhood.27 Despite the fact that males and females
show different brain developmental trajectories using these
metrics,27 previous SBM studies of CD have combined data
from both sexes.
These studies have reported lower CT in the prefrontal
cortex
(PFC),28-31
superior
temporal
cortex,28-32
supra-
marginal/angular
gyrus,29,32,33
precuneus,28,29,31,32
and
fusiform gyrus,29,32 and lower SA in PFC29,33 in participants
with CD compared to controls. Furthermore, lower gyr-
ification in the OFC/vmPFC,32 and higher gyrification in the
superior frontal gyrus (SFG), insula, fusiform gyrus,30 and
precentral gyrus32 have been reported in individuals with
CD versus controls. Despite considerable overlap between
the regions that have been identified using SBM and VBM
methods, SBM studies have highlighted additional regions
that have not yet been incorporated in neurodevelopmental
models of CD. For example, the most robust finding from
these studies—lower superior temporal gyrus CT—has not
been incorporated into theories of CD, despite various
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and VBM
studies also reporting abnormalities in this region.11,34
Accordingly, we predicted that CD would be associated
with the following: lower CT in the OFC/vmPFC and su-
perior temporal cortex; gyrification abnormalities in the
insula and PFC; and lower SA in the PFC. We further hy-
pothesized
that
cortical
abnormalities
would
be
most
evident in the most severely disordered individuals, namely,
those with more CD symptoms,35 and potentially those with
elevated callous-unemotional (CU) traits.36 We also studied
subcortical volumes to test for potential sex differences in the
relationship between CD and the volume of subcortical
structures such as the amygdala and striatum. Given the
small number of females included in previous studies, it is
not possible to make strong predictions regarding sex dif-
ferences. Nevertheless, based on the hypothesis that the
etiology and pathophysiology of CD is similar in males and
females, but that females might require a higher loading of
risk to surpass the threshold required to manifest the dis-
order,21 we expected to observe CD-related structural alter-
ations in similar regions in males and females, but to detect
more pronounced or widespread deficits in females.
METHOD
Study Participants
The sample was selected from the Neurobiology and Treatment of
Female Conduct Disorder (FemNAT-CD) study. It included 96 ad-
olescents (48 females) with CD and 104 healthy adolescents (52 fe-
males; see Table S1, available online, for distribution of participants
across sites). All participants were 14 to 18 years of age and classi-
fied as late- or postpubertal using the Pubertal Development Scale.37
The study was approved by ethics committees at each site (Sup-
plement 1, available online), and written informed consent was
obtained for all participants.
Diagnoses of CD and comorbid disorders were made using the
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age
Children–Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL38), conducted
separately with participants and parents by trained masters- and
doctoral-level staff. The interrater reliability of CD was high
(Cohen’s k ¼ 0.91), and agreement across raters was 94.5%. Similarly
high
Cohen’s
k
values
were
obtained
for
attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder (MDD),
and oppositional defiant disorder diagnoses (0.84–1.00). CD severity
was defined as the number of CD symptoms endorsed across in-
formants in the K-SADS-PL interviews. CU traits were assessed
using the CU subscale of the self-report Youth Psychopathic traits
Inventory (YPI).39 Exclusion criteria included IQ < 70, neurological
disorders, history of head trauma, autism spectrum disorders, and
psychosis, as well as standard MRI exclusion criteria. Healthy

 controls (HC) were free of current DSM-IV disorders as assessed
using the K-SADS-PL. IQ was estimated using the vocabulary and
matrix reasoning subtests of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of In-
telligence40 or the same subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale
for Children�IV.41
MRI Data Acquisition
Structural MRI data were acquired using Siemens 3T (Tim-Trio and
Prisma) or Philips 3T (Achieva) scanners (see Table S2, available
online, for scanning parameters across sites). Each site underwent a
site qualification procedure prior to commencing data collection
(Supplement 2, available online). T1-MPRAGE scans were acquired

Hz/pixels, bandwidth[Siemens] ¼ 180 Hz/pixels, total scan time ¼ 4
minutes 26 seconds [Siemens] or 6 minutes 5 seconds [Philips]). Image
quality was assessed immediately after the scan by the MRI operator,
and repeated until a high-quality image was acquired.
Image Processing
CT, SA, and gyrification were estimated at each vertex using Free-
surfer
v5.3.0
(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu).42-44
This
involved segmentation of the white matter and identification of the
white�gray matter interface, and the gray matter�cerebrospinal
fluid interfaces to create the pial surface. All surfaces were visually
inspected and segmentation errors or topological defects were
manually corrected by two authors (A.S., H.C.) who were blinded to
participant group status. The corrections included manual edits to
the white and gray matter boundaries, and adding control points
where needed. CT, SA, and gyrification (termed “local gyrification
index” [lGI]) were calculated as detailed in previous publica-
tions.42,45,46 CT and SA were smoothed using 10-mm full-width/
half-maximum Gaussian kernels. lGI was not smoothed at the
analysis level, in line with previous studies, as it is calculated with
reference to a local neighborhood value at each vertex and it is
therefore inherently smooth.47 Total GMV was estimated for each
participant and included to control for interindividual variability
in global brain size. Finally, amygdala, hippocampus, caudate,
pallidum, putamen, and thalamus volumes were computed using
the automated subcortical segmentation pipeline in FreeSurfer.48
Statistical Analysis
First, for each hemisphere, a full-factorial general linear model
(GLM) was fitted separately for CT, SA, lGI, and subcortical
volumes,
which
tested
for
effects
of
diagnosis,
sex,
and
sex-by-diagnosis interactions. Second, separate GLM correlational
analyses were conducted within the CD group to test for correla-
tions between CD severity (from K-SADS-PL) and CT, SA, lGI, and
subcortical
volumes.
We
also
tested
for
sex-by-CD
severity
interactions. A similar approach was used to test for correlations
between CU traits and cortical structure and subcortical volumes.
Third, given previous evidence suggesting quantitative brain
structural
differences
between
childhood-onset
(CO)
and
adolescence-onset (AO) CD,23,30 we compared these subgroups to
assess the validity of collapsing across them in our main analyses.
All models included age, IQ, total GMV, and scan site (each site
coded as a separate categorical variable) as covariates of no interest.
In addition, each analysis was repeated including lifetime ADHD,
MDD, and substance abuse symptoms (from K-SADS-PL) as cova-
riates of no interest, as well as excluding left-handed individuals and
those currently taking medication (see Supplement 3, available
online, for detailed information about medication). Consistent with
previous research,29,30 we first used a cluster-forming threshold of
p < .05 (two-tailed); results were then corrected for multiple com-
parisons at a whole-brain level using a Monte Carlo z-field simula-
tion in the case of the cortical analyses, and false-discovery-rate
(FDR) correction for the subcortical analyses. Clusters were reported
if they met a whole-brain corrected threshold of p < .05 (two-tailed;
see Hagler et al.49 for more information about this approach).
RESULTS
Table 1 provides information about the sample’s de-
mographic characteristics. The four groups did not signifi-
cantly differ in age, pubertal status, or handedness. Within
the male and female samples, the CD groups had lower full-
scale IQs and reported more CD and ADHD symptoms and
higher levels of CU traits than HCs. Males with CD further
displayed more ADHD symptoms and higher levels of CU
traits than the other three groups. Furthermore, by design,
our control groups were free of current psychiatric disorders;
thus the CD group had significantly higher levels of
comorbidity and medication use. However, apart from
ADHD comorbidity, the male and female CD groups did not
differ in terms of comorbidity or medication use. Total GMV
was higher in males overall compared to females (p < .001),
as expected,50 but there were no significant differences
in total GMV between males with CD and male controls
(p ¼ .81) or females with CD and female controls (p ¼ .92).
Main Effects of Diagnosis
Relative to controls, participants with CD showed lower CT
in the bilateral vmPFC, left rostral middle frontal gyrus, and
left precentral gyrus (Figure 1A; Table S3, available online).
Participants with CD also showed greater SA in the left
precentral/postcentral gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus/
fusiform gyrus, and right lateral occipital cortex compared
with
controls
(Table
S4,
available
online).
The
CD
group showed higher lGI in the left superior temporal
gyrus/posterior insula, vmPFC/lateral OFC, and postcentral/
precentral gyrus (Figure 1B) and lower lGI in right inferior
frontal gyrus (IFG) and supramarginal gyrus, relative to
controls (Table S5, available online).
Main Effects of Sex
Relative to males, females showed higher CT in pre- and
postcentral gyrus, and higher SA and lGI in several temporal
and frontal regions (Tables S3–S5, available online), consis-
tent with previous studies investigating sex differences.51-53
Sex-by-Diagnosis Interactions
Significant sex-by-diagnosis interactions were observed for
all SBM measures. Males with CD showed lower, and
females with CD showed higher, CT relative to their
respective control groups in the left superior parietal lobule
and right supramarginal gyrus (Figure 1A). In left SFG,
males with CD displayed higher, while females with CD
displayed lower, lGI and SA relative to their respective
control groups (Figure 1B and 1C, respectively). In the left
parahippocampal cortex, males with CD displayed higher,

 whereas females with CD displayed lower, lGI compared
with their sex-matched control groups.
Subcortical Structures
There were no main effects of diagnosis or sex-by-diagnosis
interactions on amygdala, hippocampal, or striatal volumes.
However, females overall showed higher bilateral pallidum
volumes than males (left: p < .001 and right: p ¼ .004,
FDR-corrected; Table S6, available online).
CD Severity Effects
There were no significant correlations between CD severity
and CT or subcortical volumes, and no sex-by-CD severity
interactions for these measures. However, CD severity was
positively correlated with right posterior cingulate cortex/
precuneus SA in males and females. A sex-by-CD severity
interaction was observed for SA: males showed a positive,
whereas females showed a negative, correlation between
CD severity and right superior frontal/precentral gyrus
SA (Figure 2A, Table S7, available online). Finally, two
sex-by-CD severity interactions were observed for lGI:
females showed a positive and males showed a negative
correlation between CD severity and left fusiform gyrus lGI.
Conversely, CD severity was negatively correlated with left
SFG/paracingulate cortex lGI in females, but not in males
(Figure 2B, Table S7, available online).

SEX DIFFERENCES IN CONDUCT DISORDER
 Effects of CU Traits
There were no significant correlations between CU traits and
SA or subcortical volumes. CU traits were negatively
correlated with occipital pole CT, and bilateral fusiform
gyrus and left superior parietal cortex lGI. In addition, we
observed several sex-by-CU traits interactions, whereby
males showed a positive and females showed a negative
correlation between CU traits and lGI, including in the left
vmPFC and right SFG (Table S8, available online).
Childhood-Onset Versus Adolescent-Onset CD
There were no differences between the CO-CD and AO-CD
subtypes in CT, SA, or subcortical volumes. There were
differences between these subgroups in lGI in several re-
gions including the anterior insula (Table S9, available on-
line); however, these regions were not altered as a function
of CD, sex, or their interaction, thus we did not distinguish
between these subgroups in the main lGI analyses.
Potential Confounds
The main effects of diagnosis on vmPFC CT and lGI and the
sex-by-diagnosis interactions for supramarginal CT and SFG
lGI and SA remained significant after controlling for ADHD
symptoms. In addition, all main effects of sex, CD severity
correlations, and sex-by-CD severity interactions reported
above remained significant. We also tested the impact of
including depression and substance abuse as additional
covariates,
excluding
site
and
IQ
as
covariates,
and
excluding left-handed participants, and participants who
were currently taking medication. Finally, we ran an
additional analysis with IQ-matched subgroups. The overlap
in brain areas identified in the main analyses and these
additional analyses is shown in Tables S10 to S12, available
online. Although the majority of the findings remained
significant at a whole-brain–corrected level, controlling for
depressive symptoms attenuated the significance of some of
the findings, although all were present at an uncorrected
level, and the effect of diagnosis on vmPFC CT remained
significant at a whole-brain–corrected level.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first SBM study specifically
designed and with a large-enough sample to test for sex
differences in the relationship between CD and cortical
structure. Our results support previous studies showing
associations between CD and alterations in cortical thickness
(CT), surface area (SA), and local gyrification index (lGI). As
hypothesized, and as previously found in predominantly
male samples,28-32 CD was associated with lower ventro-
medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) CT. This was accompa-
nied by higher gyrification in overlapping regions of
vmPFC, as well as the posterior insula, in the CD group. As
noted above, the vmPFC is implicated in stimulus valuation
and reward processing,54 although it is also involved in
emotion regulation55 and empathic processing.56 Neuro-
psychological studies have consistently provided evidence
for deficits in these processes in CD.8,57,58 Although CD-
related alterations were observed in a more posterior

 location in the present study, higher insula gyrification has
been reported previously in CD.30 The insula plays a key
role in empathy and processing aversive stimuli,59,60 both of
which are reported to be abnormal in CD.56 Against expec-
tation and previous findings,30,33 we found greater SA in
participants with CD relative to controls, although the
affected regions differed from those reported previously.
These observations of higher SA and lGI in males with CD
may reflect delayed brain development in CD in general,
superimposed on sex differences in brain maturation (i.e.,
earlier maturation in females). These combined effects of sex
and diagnosis mean that males with CD show the most
protracted brain development of the four groups studied
here. Of interest, a recent longitudinal imaging study sug-
gests that individuals with conduct problems show delayed
brain development relative to that in healthy peers,61 similar
to earlier findings in children with ADHD.62
Significant sex-by-diagnosis interactions were detected in
several brain regions across the three SBM measures—e.g.,
males with CD showed lower, and females with CD showed
higher, supramarginal gyrus CT relative to their sex-
matched control groups. Lower supramarginal gyrus CT
has been reported in two SBM studies of CD,29,32 both of
which used mixed-sex (but predominantly male) samples.
Lower supramarginal CT therefore appears to be specific to
males with CD. Interestingly, this area is implicated in de-
cision
making63
and
emotion
processing.64
Therefore,
supramarginal gyrus structural alterations may be related to
the deficits reported in decision-making and emotion-
recognition tasks in males with CD.56,65
Sex-by-diagnosis interactions were also observed in the
superior frontal gyrus (SFG), an area involved in higher
cognitive functions such as working memory.66 In this region,
males with CD showed higher, and females with CD showed
lower, lGI and SA relative to their control groups. Higher SFG
lGI and SA in males with CD is consistent with findings
obtained using a predominantly male sample.32 However,
this is the first study to show that males and females with CD
show changes in SFG lGI and SA in opposite directions
relative to their respective control groups. Furthermore,
males and females showed different relationships between
CD severity and lGI and SA in several regions, including the
fusiform gyrus. Again, this suggests that the relationship
between CD and cortical structure partly differs by sex. The
fusiform gyrus is functionally connected to the amygdala,67
and CD-related changes in fusiform activity have been
reported
in
fMRI
studies
of
emotion
processing.67,68
However, given the novelty of these findings, they need to
be interpreted with caution, and replication is required.
It was surprising that we did not find lower amygdala or
striatal volumes in the CD compared to the control group,
considering
results from previous
work using similar
subcortical
volume
measures31
and
VBM
studies
of
CD.23,35,69,70 However, the current study included partici-
pants within a narrower age range than other studies, and
used an integrated measure of volume rather than assessing
gray matter volume specifically; these factors may have
influenced the results.
We note that some of our findings were influenced by
comorbidity. This was most apparent for the main effects of
diagnosis on SA and lGI, whereas the sex-by-diagnosis
interactions and CD severity correlations largely remained
unaffected. Due to the strong overlap between ADHD and
CD, and the idea that CD-related findings should be inter-
preted both with and without considering ADHD comor-
bidity,71 we have focused on the findings that remained
significant across the two analyses. However, controlling for
depression attenuated some of the results, and future studies
need to account for the effects of depression—ideally by
comparing individuals with CD with, versus without,
depression.
The present findings did not support the hypothesis that
females who reach the diagnostic threshold for CD would
show similar, but simply more pronounced, brain abnor-
malities than their male counterparts. Instead, we observed
opposite CD-related effects in males and females for all three
cortical structure measures and in multiple brain regions.
This study is one of the first to provide evidence that the
neurobiological basis of CD may be qualitatively, rather than
quantitatively, different in males and females. However, we
acknowledge that further research is required to investigate
the possibility that there may be sex differences in the
pathophysiology, and possibly the pathogenesis, of CD.
Conversely, complex effects of sex and diagnosis on brain
development may partly explain these findings that, in
general, CD is associated with delayed brain maturation, but
this effect is most pronounced in males in late adolescence.
On the basis of the findings presented here, we recom-
mend that researchers avoid collapsing across the sexes in
neuroimaging studies of CD, because combining males and
females runs the risk of canceling out diagnosis effects that
are either present only in one sex or altered in opposite
directions
in
males
and
females.
Accordingly,
future
cross-sectional studies of CD might opt to recruit single-sex
samples if they can test only relatively small samples, or
deliberately recruit large numbers of males and females to
contrast these groups with sex-matched control groups.
The current study had several strengths. We included a
large, sex-balanced sample, matched at the group level for
age and pubertal status, and examined three separate SBM
measures and subcortical volumes. We also accounted
statistically for group differences in IQ, site, and several
comorbid disorders. However, several limitations should be
noted. First, although data acquisition protocols were
matched across sites, it is possible, as with any multisite
study, that scanner hardware and software differences
between sites could introduce error/noise into the data. In
addition, there were differences between the results obtained
at the four sites, potentially due to the different sample sizes
(see Figure S1, available online, for uncorrected effect size
maps from the four sites). Thus, combining data across
several relatively small samples poses a potential threat to
the validity of the overall results. Second, we did not correct
across the three SBM measures simultaneously, potentially
increasing the risk of type I errors. However, this is not
commonly performed, and given that our results were

SEX DIFFERENCES IN CONDUCT DISORDER
 already whole-brain corrected, this could have introduced
type II errors instead. In addition, although performing
multiple
supplementary
analyses
provided
important
information about the impact of comorbidity and IQ on our
findings, it was not possible to control for the number of
analyses performed, stressing the provisional nature of the
findings and the importance of further investigation.
Third, we were unable to match the CD and control groups
on IQ in the main analysis. However, because both CD groups
in this study had lower IQs compared to controls, IQ differ-
ences cannot explain the observed sex-by-diagnosis in-
teractions.
Fourth,
controlling
for
comorbid
disorders
reduced the significance of some of the results. It may be
informative for future studies to explicitly investigate the
impact of these variables, ideally by comparing CD in-
dividuals with versus without comorbidity, or by including a
psychiatric control group. Fifth, by design, we matched our
groups on pubertal development to reduce the possibility of
group or sex differences in brain developmental stages.72
However, we note that the relationship between pubertal
stage and brain development may differ by sex. Future ana-
lyses of data from younger children, as well as longitudinal
imaging data, are needed to investigate whether the results
reported here are stable across development. Finally, using
the number of CD symptoms as a measure of severity is
suboptimal, as these symptoms are not equivalent to each
other, for example, weapon use versus lying.
We observed similarities and differences between males
and females in the relationship between CD and cortical
structure, providing initial evidence that there may be
important sex differences in the neurobiological basis of CD.
Because this is the first study of its kind, it will be important
to examine whether the findings can be replicated in future
studies. These results were largely unrelated to ADHD and
substance abuse comorbidity, differences in IQ, or CD
age-of-onset effects, although controlling for comorbid
depression reduced the strength of some of the findings. The
findings demonstrate the importance of studying males and
females with CD separately and potentially treating them
differently in clinical settings. &
