Abstract
BACKGROUND—Annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States are 
provided through an ongoing collaboration among the American Cancer Society (ACS), the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the 
North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). This annual report 
highlights the increasing burden of liver and intrahepatic bile duct (liver) cancers.
METHODS—Cancer incidence data were obtained from the CDC, NCI, and NAACCR; data 
about cancer deaths were obtained from the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). 
Annual percent changes in incidence and death rates (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard 
Population) for all cancers combined and for the leading cancers among men and women were 
estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term trends (incidence for 1992–2012 and mortality for 
1975–2012) and short-term trends (2008–2012). In-depth analysis of liver cancer incidence 
included an age-period-cohort analysis and an incidence-based estimation of person-years of life 
lost because of the disease. By using NCHS multiple causes of death data, hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
and liver cancer-associated death rates were examined from 1999 through 2013.
RESULTS—Among men and women of all major racial and ethnic groups, death rates continued 
to decline for all cancers combined and for most cancer sites; the overall cancer death rate (for 
both sexes combined) decreased by 1.5% per year from 2003 to 2012. Overall, incidence rates 
decreased among men and remained stable among women from 2003 to 2012. Among both men 
and women, deaths from liver cancer increased at the highest rate of all cancer sites, and liver 
cancer incidence rates increased sharply, second only to thyroid cancer. Men had more than twice 
the incidence rate of liver cancer than women, and rates increased with age for both sexes. Among 
non-Hispanic (NH) white, NH black, and Hispanic men and women, liver cancer incidence rates 
were higher for persons born after the 1938 to 1947 birth cohort. In contrast, there was a minimal 
birth cohort effect for NH Asian and Pacific Islanders (APIs). NH black men and Hispanic men 
had the lowest median age at death (60 and 62 years, respectively) and the highest average person-
years of life lost per death (21 and 20 years, respectively) from liver cancer. HCV and liver cancer-
associated death rates were highest among decedents who were born during 1945 through 1965.
CONCLUSIONS—Overall, cancer incidence and mortality declined among men; and, although 
cancer incidence was stable among women, mortality declined. The burden of liver cancer is 
growing and is not equally distributed throughout the population. Efforts to vaccinate populations 
that are vulnerable to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and to identify and treat those living with 
HCV or HBV infection, metabolic conditions, alcoholic liver disease, or other causes of cirrhosis 
can be effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of liver cancer.

 INTRODUCTION
This marks the 18th year that the American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American 
Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) have collaborated to develop the 
Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer.1–17 These reports provide annual 
updates on cancer incidence, deaths, and trends of the most common cancers in the United 
States. In addition, each publication features an in-depth analysis of a selected special topic. 
This year’s report provides a detailed analysis of the incidence of liver and intrahepatic bile 
duct (liver) cancers and rates of liver cancer and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection-
associated deaths.
Worldwide, liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer among men, the ninth most 
common cancer among women, and the second most common cause of cancer death for men 
and women combined.18 Although liver cancer occurs more frequently in less developed 
regions of the world,18 it is still a significant health outcome in the United States. In 2012, a 
total of 28,012 persons in the United States (excluding Nevada) were diagnosed with liver 
cancer (20,207 men and 7805 women), and 22,972 died of this disease (15,563 men and 
7409 women).19 The relative 5-year survival rate for liver cancer is 16.6% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 16.3%–16.9%).19 Forty-three percent of patients with liver cancer are 
diagnosed at a localized stage, for which the 5-year relative survival rate is 30.5%.20 Those 
diagnosed at a regional stage (27%) and a distant stage (18%) have 5-year relative survival 
rates of 10.7% and 3.1%, respectively.20
Viral hepatitis is an important cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common 
histologic type of liver cancer. Chronic infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HCV are 
well documented risk factors for HCC. Globally, it is reported that both infections contribute 
to greater than 60% of HCC cases.21 In the United States, it has also been reported that 
chronic HBV and HCV infections are major risk factors for HCC and are correlated with 
increasing trends in HCC incidence.22,23 Data from national US surveys indicate that from 
850,000 to 2.2 million persons are living with chronic HBV infection,24,25 and from 2.7 to 
3.5 million persons are living with chronic HCV infection.26,27 The age-specific prevalence 
of HCV infection also suggests that persons born during 1945 through 1965 are more likely 
than other birth cohorts to be diagnosed with HCV infection.28 In the absence of improved 
testing and appropriate treatment, HCV infections among this generation will continue to 
account for a substantial proportion of deaths from liver cancer.29 Consequently, the CDC 
and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently recommended a 1-
time HCV test for persons born during 1945 through 1965.30,31 Other important risk factors 
for liver cancer include excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease, rare metabolic disorders, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.32 In this report, we closely 
examine incidence and mortality trends from liver cancer among different groups, discuss 
the potential risk factors contributing to changes in liver cancer rates, and present ongoing 
public health interventions aimed at reducing the burden of liver cancer in the United States.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources, Codes, and Selection Criteria
Cancer incidence data—Population-based cancer incidence data were obtained from 
registries that participate in the CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) 
and/or the NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and 
voluntarily submit their data to NAACCR. Participating registries met NAACCR’s data-
quality criteria for the December 2014 submission cycle.33 Site and histology were coded 
according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) edition in 
use at the time of diagnosis, converted to the third edition coding,34 and categorized 
according to SEER site groups.20 Only cases defined as malignant under ICD-O-2 and ICD-
O-3 were included in this report.
Incidence rates were calculated for all sites combined, for childhood cancers (ages 0–14 and 
0–19 years), and for the most common cancers for each of the 5 major racial and ethnic 
groups (white, black, Asian and Pacific Islander [API], American Indian/Alaska Native [AI/
AN], and Hispanic). Rates for Hispanic ethnicity included individuals from all races 
identified as Hispanic, except in the special section, as noted. Rates for AI/ANs were based 
on cases and deaths occurring in counties covered by the Indian Health Service Contract 
Health Service Delivery Areas (CHSDA), because it has been demonstrated that these areas 
have more accurate classification of AI/AN race.10,35,36
Cancer incidence data were not available uniformly for every calendar year, geographic area, 
or racial and ethnic group in the United States. Long-term (1992–2012) incidence trends for 
all racial and ethnic groups combined were estimated by using data from the SEER-13 
registries, which cover approximately 14% of the US population.37 Five-year (2008–2012) 
average annual incidence rates, 5-year (2008–2012) and 10-year (2003–2012) incidence 
trends for all racial and ethnic groups combined, and 10-year trends for each of the 5 major 
racial and ethnic populations were calculated by using combined data from the NPCR and 
SEER registries as submitted to NAACCR. Together, participating registries cover 97% (for 
2008–2012) and 92% (for 2003–2012) of the US population.
Cancer mortality data—Cause of death was based on death certificate information 
reported to state vital statistics offices and compiled into a national file for the entire United 
States by the CDC National Center for Health Statistics’ (NCHS) National Vital Statistics 
System.38 The underlying causes of death were selected according to the International 
Classification of Disease (ICD) codes and rules in use at the time of death (ICD-8 through 
ICD-10) and categorized according to SEER site groups to maximize comparability between 
ICD and ICD-O versions.20 Death rates were calculated for all cancer sites combined, for 
childhood cancers, and the most common cancers among men and women identified by the 
incidence analysis. We examined long-term (1975–2012) mortality trends for all racial and 
ethnic groups combined and 5-year (2008–2012) average annual age-adjusted death rates 
and 10-year (2003–2012) mortality trends for each of the 5 major racial and ethnic groups.
Population data—The population estimates that were used in this report represent a 
modification of the intercensal and Vintage 2013 annual times series of July 1; and county

 population estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin were produced by the US Census 
Bureau’s Population Estimates Program in collaboration with the CDC’s NCHS and with 
support from the NCI.39 The estimates incorporate intercensal (July 1, 2000–2009) and 
Vintage 2013 (July 1, 2010–2013) bridged, single-race estimates that are derived from the 
original multiple race categories in the 2000 and 2010 US Censuses (as specified in the 1997 
Office of Management and Budget standards for the collection of data about race and 
ethnicity).40 For most states, population estimates as of July 1 of each year were used to 
calculate incidence rates, which were presumed to reflect the average population of a 
defined geographic area for a calendar year; however, some adjustments were made to refine 
these estimates, as has been done in previous reports.16,17,39
Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer-Specific Incidence and Mortality Data
The special analysis for this report included all invasive liver and intrahepatic bile duct 
(liver) cancer cases (ICD-O-3 site codes C220 and C221, excluding histology codes 9050–
9055; 9140; 9590–9989). Analyses in this section were restricted to 4 large, nonoverlapping 
racial or ethnic groups with a sufficient number of cases to produce informative results: non-
Hispanic (NH) white, NH black, NH API, and Hispanic. Small counts produced unstable 
rate estimates for the NH AI/AN group and have been excluded from certain analyses.
To help understand differences in liver cancer incidence rates and trends by birth cohort, we 
conducted age-period-cohort analyses. We grouped liver cancer incidence data from the 
SEER-13 registries into 5-year age groups (ages 35–39 through 80–84 years) and 5-year 
calendar periods (1993–1997, 1998–2002, 2003–2007, and 2008–2012), spanning 13 
partially overlapping, 10-year birth cohorts (from 1908–1917 [referred to as “1913,” the 
mid-year of birth] through 1968–1977). To analyze age-specific liver cancer incidence rates 
by period, data from the SEER-13 registries were grouped into 5-year age groups (35–39 
through 80–84 and ≥85 years) and 5-year periods (1992–1996, 2000–2004, and 2008–2012), 
which were the beginning, middle, and end of the 20-year span.
To examine the distribution of liver cancer deaths by race and ethnicity, SEER-18 incidence-
based mortality data for liver cancer deaths (ICD-10 codes C22) during 2008 through 2012 
were analyzed. All patients in this analysis were diagnosed with and subsequently died of 
liver cancer, lessening the misclassification of death from liver cancer metastasis as death 
from primary liver cancer. Patients who had death certificate and autopsy-only diagnoses 
were excluded. SEER-18 registries cover 28% of the US population.
Because HCV infection is a major contributing factor for HCC in the United States, we also 
examined HCV and liver cancer-associated mortality for 1999 through 2013. The cancer 
mortality data and population files used in this analysis were consistent with the files used 
for other cancer mortality estimates in this report. The data were analyzed to describe 
mortality by birth year category and year of death and by birth year category and age at 
death for decedents aged ≥35 years who had both HCV and liver cancer listed among causes 
of death. Birth year and cohort were assigned by subtracting the age at death from the year 
of death. The underlying cause of death and multiple causes of death were selected 
according to ICD-10 codes41 and selection rules in use at the time of death.42 HCV and liver 
cancer-associated deaths were defined as having HCV (ICD-10 codes B17.1 or B18.2) and

 liver cancer (ICD-10 codes C22.0–C22.9) listed together anywhere on the death record as 
either the underlying cause or among the multiple causes of death.
Statistical Methods
Incidence and death rates and trends—Age-adjusted rates were expressed per 
100,000 persons on the basis of the 2000 US Standard Population and were generated by 
using SEER*Stat software, version 8.2.1.43 Corresponding 95% CIs were calculated as 
modified γ intervals.44 For stability and reliability, incidence rates were suppressed if there 
were fewer than 16 cases for the time interval, and incidence trends were suppressed if there 
were fewer than 10 cases for at least a year within the time interval. Death rates were 
suppressed if there were fewer than 10 deaths.
Trends in age-adjusted cancer incidence and death rates were estimated using joinpoint 
regression.45,46 Up to 5 joinpoints were allowed in models for 1975 to 2012, up to 3 
joinpoints were allowed in models for 1992 to 2012, and up to 2 joinpoints were allowed in 
models for 2003 to 2012. The resulting trends were described according to the annual 
percent change (APC). The average APC (AAPC) was estimated as a weighted geometric 
average of the APCs, with the weights equal to the length of each line segment during the 
prespecified, fixed interval.47 Long-term incidence trends were calculated by using both 
observed and delay-adjusted SEER-13 data.48 Descriptions of the long-term incidence trends 
were based on the delay-adjusted data unless otherwise noted. Delay-adjustment factors are 
not currently published for NPCR; thus, all 5-year and 10-year trends were based on 
observed NPCR and SEER combined data without delay adjustment. We used the t test and 
the Z test, respectively, to test whether the APC and AAPC were statistically different from 
zero. All statistical tests were 2-sided. In describing trends, the term increase or decrease 
was used when the slope of the trend (APC or AAPC) was statistically significant (2-sided P 
< .05). For nonstatistically significant trends, terms such as stable, nonsignificant increase, 
and nonsignificant decrease were used.
Liver Cancer Age-Period-Cohort and Estimated Years-of-Life-Lost Analysis
Liver cancer incidence rates were examined by sex, age, race or ethnicity, state, and year of 
diagnosis by using the same methods described above. The NCI’s online age-period-cohort 
analysis tool was used to calculate cohort rate ratios, comparing liver cancer incidence rates 
in each birth cohort relative to the 1943 birth cohort, and adjusting for age and period 
effects.49 The 1943 birth cohort was selected as the reference because it immediately 
preceded the known increase in the prevalence of HCV infection for individuals born during 
1945 through 1965.28
Proportions of incidence-based deaths from liver cancer and median age at death were 
determined by sex and race or ethnicity.50 Person-years of life lost (PYLL) to liver cancer 
were calculated by linking the “expectation of life at age x” column of the US 2010 
complete life tables to single-year age-at-death data.20,51,52 All-race life tables were used to 
calculate overall PYLL, whereas single-sex, all-race tables were used for gender-specific 
analyses. The average PYLL (APYLL) per death was calculated as the PYLL divided by the 
number of deaths.

 HCV and liver cancer-associated death rates during 1999 through 2013 for those aged ≥35 
years according to 3 birth-year categories (those born before 1945, during 1945–1965, and 
during 1966–1978) were examined by year at death. To remove the effect of age, HCV and 
liver cancer-associated death rates also were examined using slightly more refined birth-year 
categories (those born before 1945, during 1945–1949, during 1950–1959, during 1960–
1965, and during 1966–1978) and by age at death. Crude HCV and liver cancer-associated 
death rates were calculated by dividing the number of deaths in each category by the US 
Census population estimate for each year. A similar methodology was applied in a previous 
study that examined the burden of mortality associated with viral hepatitis in the United 
States from 1999 to 2007.53
RESULTS
Long-Term Trends of Cancer Incidence Rates for the Most Common Cancers
Trends in delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates using data from SEER-13 registries that 
submitted data to the NCI from 1992 to 2012 are presented in Table 1. Cancer incidence 
rates decreased among men during each period, but at different rates. In contrast, cancer 
incidence rates among women increased slightly (0.8% per year) from 1992 to 1998, then 
remained stable. Among children in both age groups, (ages 0–14 and 0–19 years), incidence 
rates increased from 1992 to 2012 with an APC of 0.8%.
During 2003 through 2012, the AAPC indicated that overall cancer incidence rates for all 
persons combined decreased on average 0.7% per year (Table 1). Among men, overall 
cancer incidence decreased on average by 1.4% per year during 2003 through 2012; 
however, among women, rates were stable during this 10-year period. Among men, 
incidence rates for 7 of the 17 most common cancers decreased from 2003 to 2012 (prostate, 
colon and rectum [colorectal], lung and bronchus [lung], stomach, larynx, urinary bladder 
[bladder], and brain and other nervous system [brain]). The most striking decline was for 
prostate cancer, which had an average 6.6% decline per year for the most recent 5-year 
period (2008–2012). In contrast, incidence rates increased among men during 2003 through 
2012 for 8 cancers (thyroid, liver, myeloma, melanoma of the skin [melanoma], kidney and 
renal pelvis [kidney], leukemia, pancreas, and oral cavity and pharynx). Among women, 
incidence rates for 6 of the 18 most common cancers decreased during 2003 through 2012 
(colorectal, cervix uteri [cervix], lung, bladder, ovary, and stomach), whereas incidence rates 
among women increased during 2003 through 2012 for 8 cancers (thyroid; liver; corpus and 
uterus, not otherwise specified [uterus]; kidney; pancreas; melanoma; leukemia; and 
myeloma). Incidence rates were stable for all other sites.
Long-Term Trends of Cancer Death Rates for the Most Common Cancers
The long-term (1975–2012) mortality trend analysis revealed that the overall cancer death 
rate in the United States has generally declined since the early 1990s for adults and since the 
1970s for children (Table 2). More recently, from 2003 to 2012, death rates continued to 
decline by an average of 1.5% per year overall, by 1.3% per year for children ages 0 to 14 
years, and by 2.0% per year for children ages 0 to 19 years. Among men, death rates 
declined overall from 2003 to 2012 (1.8% per year). Relatively large declines among men

 were also observed for cancers of the prostate (3.5% per year), stomach (3.3% per year), 
colorectum (2.9% per year), lung (2.7% per year), and larynx (2.5% per year) and for non-
Hodgkin lymphoma (2.2% per year). Declines in death rates during this time among men 
were ≤1% per year for leukemia, myeloma, and cancers of the esophagus and kidney. Death 
rates among men remained stable during this time for melanoma and for cancers of the 
bladder, brain, and oral cavity and pharynx. Death rates increased among men during 2003 
through 2012 for cancers of the liver (2.8% per year); soft tissue, including the heart (1.1% 
per year); and pancreas (0.3% per year).
Among women, during 2003 through 2012, death rates declined overall (1.4% per year) and 
for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.1% per year), colorectal cancer (2.9% per year), leukemia 
(1.2% per year), and myeloma (1.2% per year), and for cancers of the stomach (2.6% per 
year), ovary (2.0% per year), breast (1.9% per year), lung (1.4% per year), oral cavity and 
pharynx (1.3% per year), gallbladder (1.2% per year), kidney (1.0% per year), cervix (0.9% 
per year), and bladder (0.4% per year), and remained stable for brain cancer, but increased 
for cancers of the liver (2.2% per year), uterus (1.1% per year), and pancreas (0.4% per 
year).
Current Cancer Incidence Rates and Trends by Race and Ethnicity
By using data from both SEER and NPCR registries, 5-year (2008–2012) average annual 
incidence rates and 5-year (2008–2012) and 10-year (2003–2012) incidence trends were 
analyzed by site, sex, and race and ethnicity (Table 3). During 2008 through 2012, observed 
rates of all cancers combined in all racial groups were lower among women than among men 
(412.6 vs 512.7 per 100,000). Black men had the highest overall cancer incidence rate 
(573.6 per 100,000) of any racial or ethnic group, and non-Hispanics had higher rates than 
Hispanics (464.7 vs 353.7 per 100,000). Among women, white women had the highest 
overall cancer incidence rate during this time of any racial or ethnic group (418.4 per 
100,000). Prostate cancer remained the most common cancer among men in each racial and 
ethnic group, and the rates were substantially higher than for any other type of cancer. Lung 
and colorectal cancer were the second and third most common cancers, respectively, among 
men of all racial and ethnic groups, except among Hispanic men, in whom these ranks were 
reversed. Breast cancer was the most common cancer among women of all racial and ethnic 
groups. Like in men, lung cancer was the second most common cancer among women, 
followed by colorectal cancer, except among API and Hispanic women, in whom the ranks 
were reversed. Rankings of other cancers for both men and women varied by race and 
ethnicity. White children had higher cancer incidence rates than children of other racial and 
ethnic groups.
Overall cancer incidence rates among men declined in each racial and ethnic group during 
2003 through 2012. During 2003 through 2012, the incidence rates for the 4 most common 
cancers among men decreased (prostate, lung, colorectal, and bladder) for all races except 
among black men, for whom bladder cancer incidence rates remained stable. Thyroid cancer 
incidence rates among men increased >5% annually during 2003 through 2012 for all racial 
and ethnic groups except for AI/AN, for whom the increase was not statistically significant. 
Trends in incidence rates for most cancers among men in each racial and ethnic group were

 similar in direction to those of all men combined, but some trends were not statistically 
significant. Oral cancer incidence rates decreased among black men (−2.5% per year), and 
liver cancer incidence rates decreased among API (−1.3% per year), but they increased or 
remained stable among other racial and ethnic groups.
Among women, the overall cancer incidence rates declined slightly from 2003 to 2012 for 
women in all racial and ethnic groups combined, but this decline was not statistically 
significant for most racial and ethnic groups. Whereas breast cancer incidence rates 
remained stable during this period for women overall, rates increased among black women 
(0.8% per year) and API women (1.1% per year). During 2003 through 2012, lung cancer 
incidence rates decreased among women of all racial and ethnic groups, except API and 
AI/AN. Colorectal cancer incidence rates decreased among women of all racial and ethnic 
groups; thyroid cancer incidence rates increased among women of all groups; and uterus 
cancer incidence rates increased among women of all groups, except AI/AN. Like in men, 
trends in incidence rates during the past decade for most cancers in each racial and ethnic 
group were similar in direction to those for all women combined, but some trends were not 
statistically significant. Oral cancer incidence rates decreased among black women but 
increased or remained stable among most racial and ethnic groups, and melanoma incidence 
rates increased among white women but decreased among Hispanic women.
Current Cancer Death Rates and Trends by Race and Ethnicity
Five-year (2008–2012) death rates and fixed-interval mortality trends from 2003 to 2012 
were analyzed by sex and by race and ethnicity (Table 4). For all cancer sites combined, 
cancer death rates (per 100,000) for 2008 to 2012 were higher among men than among 
women (207.9 vs 145.4). During 2008 through 2012, black men and women had the highest 
cancer death rates compared with all other racial and ethnic groups. Lung cancer was the 
leading cause of cancer death among both men and women of all racial and ethnic groups, 
except among Hispanic women, for whom mortality from breast cancer was higher. Among 
men, lung cancer was followed by prostate cancer and then colorectal cancer as the leading 
causes of cancer death, except among API men, for whom liver cancer replaced prostate 
cancer as the second leading cause of cancer death. Among women of all racial and ethnic 
groups, except Hispanic women, lung cancer was followed by breast and colorectal cancers 
as the leading causes of cancer death; among Hispanic women, breast cancer mortality was 
followed by lung cancer and colorectal cancer mortality.
From 2003 to 2012, death rates declined for the most common cancers (lung, prostate, 
colorectal, breast) among men and women of all racial and ethnic groups except for 
statistically insignificant decreases in lung cancer and colorectal cancer among AI/AN men 
and in colorectal cancer among AI/AN women. Death rates for most cancer sites declined or 
were stable from 2003 to 2012 among men and women of each racial and ethnic group, 
except for liver cancer, which increased for most racial and ethnic groups except for API 
men and women and AI/AN women; pancreatic cancer, which increased among white men 
and women and API women; soft tissue cancer, which increased among white and Hispanic 
men; uterine cancer, which increased among white, black, API, and Hispanic women; and 
leukemia, which increased among API women.

 Incidence of Liver Cancer
Rates of incident liver and intrahepatic bile duct (liver) cancer were examined by mutually 
exclusive racial or ethnic groups, gender, and age during 2008 through 2012 to better 
describe demographic patterns (Table 5). Among men and women, liver cancer incidence 
rates were highest among NH AI/ANs, followed by NH APIs, and Hispanics. Among all 
racial or ethnic groups, liver cancer incidence rates among men were more than twice those 
among women. Among men, liver cancer incidence rates increased during 2008 through 
2012 among NH white, NH black, and NH AI/AN men, but decreased among NH API men, 
and were stable among Hispanic men. A different pattern emerged for liver cancer incidence 
rates among women, which increased among Hispanic women and among NH white and NH 
black women. Among both men and women, liver cancer incidence rates increased 
significantly from 2008 to 2012, beginning at age 55 years, and the largest AAPC was 
observed among the group ages 60 to 64 years among men and the group ages 55 to 59 years 
among women. Liver cancer incidence rates among both men and women increased with age 
for almost all groups until age ≥85 years. State-specific liver cancer incidence rates ranged 
3-fold, from 3.3 to 12.5 per 100,000 persons (Fig. 1). Liver cancer incidence rates were 
highest in Pacific states, in states on the southern US border, in the District of Columbia, and 
in a few states in the Northeast, including Delaware, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New 
York.
The age distribution of liver cancer diagnosed during 2008 through 2012 varied across racial 
or ethnic groups (Fig. 2). Although liver cancer incidence rates generally increased with age, 
the rate of increase varied by racial or ethnic group. Furthermore, liver cancer incidence 
rates during 2008 through 2012 among NH blacks peaked at an earlier age (60–64 years), 
and then decreased at older ages. The NH AI/AN population also had an increase at younger 
ages (ages 55–59 years); however, liver cancer incidence rates continued to increase among 
this group up to ages 80 to 84 years. The statistical uncertainty in the liver cancer incidence 
rates by age group among the NH AI/AN population was mostly caused by the smaller 
number of cases at each age, as indicated in the Figure 2 inset. Because of this statistical 
instability, the incidence rates for NH AI/AN populations are not provided separately in later 
analyses. NH API populations experienced the highest liver cancer incidence rates for those 
aged <50 years and ≥65 years (after NH AI/AN populations), but Hispanic and NH blacks 
had higher rates in the group ages 50 to 64 years. The lowest liver cancer incidence rates for 
each age group were observed among NH white populations.
Figure 3 illustrates the cohort rate ratios and 95% CIs by race or ethnicity for liver cancer 
incidence relative to the experience of the 1943 reference birth cohort. Among NH white, 
NH black, and Hispanic men and women, the cohort rate ratio was <1.0 for the 1913 to 1938 
birth cohorts. The rate ratio then sharply increased for birth cohorts 1948 through 1953. The 
rate ratio for birth cohorts 1953 through 1968 slightly decreased among NH whites and 
Hispanics but decreased sharply among NH blacks. In contrast, the cohort relative risk 
remained unchanged for NH APIs, signifying a minimal birth-cohort effect.
Figure 4 illustrates liver cancer incidence rates by age for cases diagnosed during 3 time 
intervals: 1992 to 1996, 2000 to 2004, and 2008 to 2012. Liver cancer incidence rates in 
general, as noted above, continued to increase with advancing age for each diagnosis period.

 However, during 2008 through 2012, liver cancer incidence rates among NH blacks were 
highest among persons ages 55 to 59 years, who are in the 1953 birth cohort (born during 
1948–1957). A similar pattern is observed among NH whites and Hispanics, for whom there 
was a sharp increase among those ages 55 to 59 years during 2008 through 2012, although 
liver cancer incidence rates continued to increase with age. Among NH whites, NH blacks, 
and Hispanics, liver cancer incidence rates were generally highest for the most recent (2008–
2012) diagnosis years and lowest for the 1992 to 1996 diagnosis years. Among Hispanics, 
there was a large difference between diagnosis years for every age; whereas, among NH 
whites and NH blacks, the largest difference was for those ages 50 to 69 years. The 
differences by diagnosis year were less pronounced among NH APIs than among other 
subgroups.
Table 6 presents incidence-based mortality data for liver cancer in the SEER-18 areas during 
2008 through 2012. More than half of these deaths (53%) occurred among NH whites. The 
median age at death from liver cancer was younger among NH blacks (median age, 61 
years) and Hispanics (median age, 64 years) than among NH whites (median age, 66 years) 
and NH APIs (median age, 68 years). The median age at death was 9 years older among 
women (median age, 72 years) than among men (median age, 63 years), but this difference 
ranged from 4 years among NH blacks to 10 years among NH APIs. More than 379,000 
person-years of life were lost to liver cancer during 2008 through 2012. The average person-
years of life that were lost to liver cancer death was higher among NH blacks (average, 22 
PYLL) and Hispanics (average, 20 PYLL) than among NH APIs and NH whites (average, 
18 PYLL for both). Although 74% of total PYLL were among men, the APYLL was similar 
among men (19 APYLL) and women (17 APYLL).
HCV and liver cancer-associated mortality from 1999 to 2013 is illustrated in Figure 5. 
Among persons for whom both HCV and liver cancer were listed as causes of death, those 
born during 1945 through 1965 had the largest increase in mortality from 1999 to 2013 
relative to the other birth-year categories (Fig. 5A). Considering the differences in age 
between birth cohorts, those born during 1945 through 1965 had substantially higher rates of 
HCV and liver cancer-associated deaths than the preceding or subsequent birth cohorts, 
particularly for the mid-generational group (Fig. 5B).
DISCUSSION
Ongoing reductions in both the incidence and mortality of cancer overall, and specifically 
deaths from the most common cancers (female breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers) 
in most racial and ethnic groups, represent continued progress in specific areas of public 
health and oncology care.2–17 For example, successful and comprehensive public health 
tobacco-control strategies remain an important contributing factor to the observed declines 
in lung cancer incidence and mortality among both men and women.11,54–56 To aid in the 
earlier diagnosis of lung cancer among those who remain at an increased risk from tobacco 
use, in 2013, the USPSTF recommended routine screening with low-dose computed 
tomography of persons at high-risk because of their age and cigarette smoking history.57 
Continuing public health surveillance is needed to monitor the success of these efforts to

 increase screening in appropriate populations; and resulting reductions in mortality may 
reflect a decrease in lung cancer mortality rates.
Colorectal cancer incidence and death rates also continue to decline. There is strong 
evidence to support the finding that screening for colorectal cancer reduces both the 
incidence and the mortality of the disease,58 and increases in colorectal cancer survival rates 
during the past 2 decades have been attributed largely to screening.59–61 Still, a recent report 
about the use of colorectal cancer screening indicated that 35% of US adults were not up to 
date with one of the colorectal cancer screening tests recommended by the USPSTF.62 To 
help increase colorectal cancer screening compliance, the CDC funds the Colorectal Cancer 
Control Program to implement evidence-based interventions and provide screening and 
follow-up services for a limited number of eligible individuals.63 In addition, in 2014, the 
National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, a coalition aimed at reducing colorectal cancer 
incidence and mortality, initiated a nationwide goal of increasing colorectal cancer screening 
prevalence to 80% by 2018.64
Breast cancer, as the most commonly diagnosed and second leading cause of cancer death 
among women, remains an important public health issue. Advances in treatment and early 
detection contribute to the ongoing decrease in breast cancer mortality among women 
overall.65 However, not all racial and ethnic groups benefit equally in this favorable trend: 
black women have a higher breast cancer death rate than white women.17 Efforts are 
underway to better understand the factors contributing to these observed differences, 
including surveillance of breast cancer subtypes by different racial and ethnic groups,17 and 
to promote the use of evidence-based interventions aimed at groups struggling with access to 
care, such as CDC’s National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program.66
The continued decrease in prostate cancer incidence likely reflects the continued reduction 
in the use of prostate-specific antigen testing.67–70 In 2008, the USPSTF concluded that 
there was insufficient evidence to recommend prostate cancer screening among men aged 
≥75 years; and, in 2012, it further recommended against screening for all men,71 likely 
contributing to the observed reduction in incidence rates since that time.15–17,72 Close public 
health surveillance of both prostate stage-specific incidence and death rates will be 
particularly important during future years to ensure a balance is achieved between reducing 
unnecessary screening and ensuring appropriate and early diagnosis and treatment of more 
aggressive cases of this important cancer among men.
Despite the successful reductions in the occurrence of and deaths from the most common 
cancers, several cancer sites show unfavorable trends, particularly liver cancer. Liver cancer 
death rates are increasing at the highest rate of all cancer sites among both men and women. 
Indeed, the incidence of liver cancer is also increasing at rates second only to those of 
thyroid cancer. The differences in liver cancer incidence observed by sex, race or ethnicity, 
and birth cohort highlighted in this annual report suggest differences in the distribution of a 
variety of risk factors among different groups and over time.
HCC is the most common histologic type of primary liver cancer, and HCC trends are 
largely affected by the changing prevalence of risk factors. In the United States, a critical

 risk factor is HCV infection.73 Risks for HCV transmission are primarily associated with 
parenteral exposures, including receipt of contaminated blood and injection drug use. The 
incidence of HCV infection was highest during the 1960s to 1980s, before the virus was 
discovered and preventive measures, including HCV screening of the blood supply, became 
possible. Consequently, the prevalence of HCV infection is particularly high among 
individuals born during 1945 through 1965.28,74,75 Thus, in 2012, the CDC recommended 1-
time HCV testing for individuals born during 1945 through 1965 (ages 47–67 years in 
2012).31 The following year, the USPSTF issued similar recommendations.76 This annual 
report provides evidence of an increased burden of HCV and liver cancer-associated 
mortality among this birth cohort; although, according to the 2013 National Health Interview 
Survey, only 12.3% of persons born during 1945 through 1965 reported HCV testing.77 
Increased liver cancer incidence among this birth cohort is particularly elevated for NH 
whites, NH blacks, and Hispanics. Findings of a high burden of HCC among certain racial or 
ethnic groups is consistent with race-specific HCV infection prevalence estimates from US 
surveys.78
Among APIs, HBV is the dominant HCC-related virus, particularly among those not born in 
the United States.79 Because hepatitis B vaccination of infants is now widespread, the 
prevalence of HBV infection is declining in most Asian countries among vaccinated cohorts 
of children and adolescents.80,81 Accordingly, hepatitis B vaccination is considered a best 
buy for liver cancer prevention.82 Consequently, HBV-related HCC among APIs may 
decline in coming generations. However, in the immediate term, HBV infection prevalence 
remains high among unvaccinated adults from these countries, representing an ongoing risk 
of liver cancer.83 HBV testing followed by HBV therapy is associated with a reduction from 
50% to 80% in the risk of liver cancer.84,85 In 2008, the CDC recommended HBV testing for 
persons born in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and countries in other world regions where HBV 
infection prevalence is ≥2%. In 2014, the USPSTF also recommended HBV testing for these 
target populations.86
Cirrhosis is a precursor for most liver cancers. Screening of individuals at risk of cirrhosis 
increases the chance of detecting liver cancer at an early stage when it is more amenable to 
therapy. Population groups at risk of cirrhosis include persons with metabolic disease, 
history of liver disease, history of heavy alcohol use, exposure to HCV or HBV, and some 
rare genetic disorders.87 Increasing evidence suggests that other risk factors, such as type 2 
diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome (ie, clustering of at least 3 of the following: 
obesity, elevated blood pressure, elevated fasting plasma glucose, high serum triglycerides, 
and low high-density lipoprotein levels), are also important contributing factors, particularly 
when considering the prevalence of these types of medical conditions among the population 
by using the calculation of a population-attributable fraction (PAF).32 A recent SEER-
Medicare analysis of HCC cases diagnosed during 1994 through 2007 among persons aged 
≥68 years examined odds ratios (ORs) as well as PAFs for the most common risk factors for 
HCC.32 Among this study population, the strongest predictors of HCC were HCV infection 
(OR, 39.9), HBV infection (OR, 11.2), alcohol-related disease (OR, 4.1), metabolic disease 
(OR, 3.5), and diabetes and/or obesity (OR, 2.3). However, when the prevalence of each risk 
factor was considered, diabetes and/or obesity had the highest PAF (36.6%), followed by

 alcohol-related disease (PAF, 23.5%), HCV infection (PAF, 22.4%), HBV infection (PAF, 
6.3%), and metabolic disease (PAF, 3.2%).
Although there are a variety of risk factors for liver cancer, approximately 22% of HCC 
among those aged ≥65 years in the United States is attributed to HCV,32 and an estimated 
1.6 million persons will be eligible for HCV treatment by 2020.88 Previous interferon-based 
therapies are associated with considerable toxicity,89 yet current standards of HCV treatment 
include from 8 to 12 weeks of all-oral medications with fewer side effects, which can 
produce a sustained virologic response in >85% of HCV-infected individuals who complete 
treatment.90–92 It is estimated that, compared with interferon-based therapy, newer antiviral 
therapies, such as sofosbuvir-ledipasvir, could prevent an additional 310 cases of HCC per 
10,000 treated HCV cases. However, fewer than half of persons living with HCV are aware 
of their infection; and, among those who know their status, many do not receive appropriate 
clinical management of HCV infection and associated liver disease.93 Although drug 
expenditures for treatment of HCV infection have declined as a result of mandated rebates 
for Medicaid and privately negotiated prices by health plans, the cost of HCV medications 
may limit the number of patients receiving recommended antiviral therapy.94 Barriers to 
HCV testing and access to adequate care with affordable medications must be overcome to 
prevent HCV-related liver cancer.95
The burden of liver cancer is not equally distributed across the US population, reflecting the 
heterogeneous prevalence of liver cancer risk factors among groups. Men have nearly a 3-
fold higher rate of liver cancer incidence than women. Liver cancer incidence rates generally 
increase with age. Historically, APIs have been the racial group most affected by liver 
cancer; however, that may change if the decreasing trend in this group continues as trends 
increase for other racial groups. Indeed, our analysis indicates that, among individuals ages 
55 to 64 years, NH blacks and Hispanics had higher rates than APIs. NH black and Hispanic 
men have the youngest median age at liver cancer death and the highest APYLL to liver 
cancer. Although NH whites have lower liver cancer rates than other racial or ethnic groups, 
they make up a large segment of the US population and account for the majority of deaths 
and PYLL to liver cancer in the United States.
Limitations
The completeness, quality, and geographic coverage of cancer incidence data exceed those 
available for other chronic diseases. The NPCR and SEER data set used for general trends is 
the most complete and current data set available, covering the vast majority of the US 
population. However, as with any surveillance data set, local level variations in data quality, 
incomplete geographic or population reporting, and the complexity of estimating the 
underlying populations at risk may have influenced the results reported here. For instance, 
reporting from smaller hospitals or providers unaffiliated with a cancer center may be less 
complete or may have a longer lag in reporting time. Corrections for late reporting were 
incorporated into the rates and trends that included delay adjustment; however, this 
adjustment was not possible for data used to estimate race-specific or ethnicity-specific 
incidence trends, and differing results may occur, particularly for sites typically diagnosed in 
a physician’s office, like melanoma.

 Another issue is the compatibility of the cancer data and the population data by race. Since 
2000, the US Census has provided the opportunity for respondents to self-select multiple 
race categories, which has created incompatibility between the classification of race in the 
population denominators from the Census (self-reported) with the incidence numerators 
from registry data (from medical record) and the mortality numerators from the National 
Vital Statistics System (recorded by medical examiner). The methods for developing single-
race estimates from these data are complex and can create additional uncertainties in racial 
estimates and resultant rates.96,97 The broad Hispanic and API categories may mask 
important epidemiologic variation in risk by country of origin.98,99
We present rates by race separately from Hispanic ethnicity for the cancer incidence and 
mortality section (Tables 1–4), so the race categories include Hispanics. Thus, as the 
proportion of the Hispanic population in the United States increases over time, this may 
influence the reported trends. Shifts in demographics can influence surveillance trends, and 
our results must be interpreted with this in mind. Furthermore, death rates for the AI/AN, 
API, and Hispanic populations may be underestimated because of reporting problems on the 
death certificate and should be interpreted with caution.100
Long-term trends were reported on the basis of SEER-13 registries, which represent only 
14% of the US population, and the liver cancer incidence-based mortality analysis was based 
on SEER-18 registries, which represent approximately 28% of the US population. Thus, 
these analyses may be influenced by the population composition of the SEER areas. More 
geographic population coverage was available for 5-year and 10-year trends using the 
combined NPCR and SEER data; however, because of data quality concerns, data from 5 
states were excluded from 10-year trends (resulting in 92% coverage), and data from 2 states 
were excluded for 5-year trends (resulting in 97% coverage), which may influence reported 
trends. However, >90% of the United States was represented; therefore, these exclusions 
likely have only a minor effect on national trends.
The limitations of mortality data include the incomplete ascertainment of cases, 
misclassification, and missing causes of death.101,102 However, these biases may be 
mitigated by analyzing trends in which the problems have been assumed to be relatively 
constant over time.53,103 Finally, despite using the largest national data set available for 
cancer rates, small numbers for less common sites were an issue for the smaller racial 
categories, especially AI/AN. Small numbers raise statistical issues, particularly random 
variation. When evaluating trends, it is vital to assess the magnitude and direction along with 
the notation of statistical significance, particularly for smaller subgroups.
Future Directions
This annual report brings attention to the growing burden of liver cancer in the United 
States. Most cases of liver cancer are preventable.104 One of the most important and 
preventable risk factors for liver cancer is chronic HCV infection; yet, despite this 
knowledge, new HCV infections continue to occur.28,105 Prevention strategies aimed at 
reducing the frequency of behaviors that increase the risk of HCV transmission can be 
effective in reducing HCV infection. Early diagnosis of HCV infection with referral to 
treatment services can decrease a patient’s risk for subsequent health outcomes, such as liver

 cancer, and can decrease transmission of the virus to others. Cures of HCV infection are 
associated with a 75% reduction in the risk of liver cancer.106,107 In addition to appropriate 
medical care and management for HCV infection, other strategies to reduce the burden of 
liver cancer in the United States include promoting hepatitis B vaccination strategies; 
reducing unhealthy behaviors, such as tobacco use and excessive alcohol use; and reducing 
obesity by promoting healthy eating and physical activity. Furthermore, improvements in the 
public health surveillance of both acute and chronic viral hepatitis infections can help to 
better monitor the incidence and prevalence of infections and to evaluate interventions.
Although increases in liver cancer incidence and mortality are concerning, the continuing 
decline in cancer death rates for all sites combined and for the leading cancer sites overall 
demonstrate progress in cancer prevention and control in general. However, even if 
incidence rates remain stable or decline, the number of individuals diagnosed with cancer 
and living after a diagnosis will continue to rise because of improvements in treatment and 
because of population growth and aging.108 Thus, primary, secondary, and tertiary cancer 
prevention efforts at the patient and population-based levels are important. Continued focus 
on primary prevention efforts to reduce or eradicate risk factors before cancer occurs is 
critical. Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and each cancer site has a unique set of risk 
factors. However, many modifiable cancer risk factors contribute to the burden of many 
cancer sites, including tobacco use, excess alcohol consumption, poor diet, excess body 
weight, and physical inactivity.109,110 Reductions in these unhealthy behaviors and 
improvements in healthy lifestyles over time can reduce the burden of cancer.
Although many cancer risk factors are modifiable or avoidable, many are not. Much of the 
morbidity and mortality associated with cancer can be prevented by detecting the disease at 
an early stage, when treatment is more effective.30,57,111,112 On the basis of systematic 
reviews of the net benefits and harms of screening, the USPSTF currently recommends 
population-based screening for colorectal, female breast, and cervical cancers among 
persons at average risk of developing these cancers and for lung cancer among persons at 
high-risk on the basis of their cigarette smoking history and age.113 Regardless of how the 
cancer is diagnosed, reducing morbidity and mortality associated with the disease depends 
on timely and appropriate treatment. Removing barriers to receipt of appropriate cancer 
screening and treatment, including financial barriers, is crucial.114 Programs like the CDC’s 
National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program66 and the CDC’s Colorectal 
Cancer Control Program63 can provide needed services, such as free or low-cost early cancer 
detection examinations, patient navigation services, and treatment.
For individuals diagnosed with cancer (cancer survivors), methods to mitigate the negative 
effects of a diagnosis and its treatment and to prevent the recurrence of cancer are also 
critical. Cancer survivors often face long-term adverse physical, psychosocial, and financial 
effects from their cancer diagnosis and treatment.115–121 In addition, cancer survivors are at 
an increased risk of subsequent primary cancers.122,123 Cancer can have a long-term impact 
on the health and well being of the cancer survivor. This has important implications for 
ongoing preventive care for all cancers and comorbid conditions.

 Finally, disease surveillance is essential to the practice of public health for guiding 
prevention and control activities, monitoring trends, and evaluating outcomes.124,125 
Information obtained from cancer incidence registries and vital statistics systems provide 
decision makers with vital information necessary to lead and manage effective cancer 
prevention and control programs. Cancer registry systems are among the most sophisticated 
and standardized surveillance systems in the United States. Routine monitoring of cancer 
incidence and mortality helps to evaluate outcomes of public health-oriented cancer 
prevention efforts and to identify areas and populations with high cancer incidence or 
mortality rates that can benefit from targeted interventions to promote healthy environments 
and behaviors.

Abbreviations: AAPC, average annual percent change; APC, annual percent change; NOS, not otherwise specified.
aSource: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-13 areas covering about 14% of the US population (Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Utah, and New Mexico; the Alaska Native Tumor Registry; 
rural Georgia; and the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose-Monterey, Detroit, Atlanta, and Seattle-Puget Sound).
bJoinpoint analyses with up to 3 joinpoints yielding up to 4 trend segments (Trends 1–4) were based on rates per 100,000 persons and were age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups: 
ages <1 year, 1–4 years, 5–9 years, …, 80–84 years, and ≥85 years; Census publication p25-1130 [US Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports, p25-1130. Washington, DC: US Government 
Printing Office; 2000]). For joinpoint analysis, the Joinpoint Regression Program was used (version 4.2.0.0, April 2015; Statistical Research and Applications Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, 
MD).
cThe AAPC is a weighted average of the APCs calculated by joinpoint regression.
dThe APC is based on rates that were age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups; Census publication p25-1130).
eAll sites exclude myelodysplastic syndromes and borderline tumors; ovary excludes borderline tumors.
fThe APC is statistically significantly different from zero (2-sided t test; P < .05).
gThe AAPC is statistically significantly different from zero (2-sided Z test; P < .05).

Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming]).
bWhite, black, API, and AI/AN (CHSDA 2012 counties) include Hispanic and non-Hispanic; the race and ethnicity categories are not mutually exclusive. AI/AN (CHSDA 2012) statistics exclude data from Kansas.
cCancers are listed in descending rank of sex-specific, age-adjusted rates for 2008 through 2012 for all racial and ethnic groups combined. More than 15 cancers may appear under men and women to include the top 15 cancers in each racial and ethnic group.
dRates are per 100,000 persons and were age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups: ages <1 year, 1–4 years, 5–9 years, …, 80–84 years, ≥85 years; Census publication p25-1130 [US Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports, p25-1130. 
Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office; 2000]).
eThe AAPC is a weighted average of the annual percent change (APC) calculated by joinpoint analyses with up to 2 joinpoints yielding up to 3 trend segments based on rates per 100,000 persons and age adjusted to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups; Census 
publication p25-1130). For the joinpoint analysis, the Joinpoint Regression Program was used (version 4.2.0.0, April 2015; Statistical Research and Applications Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD).
fFor all sites, myelodysplastic syndromes are included for the rate calculations but not for the APC calculations; they are excluded from cancer-specific analyses. Ovary excludes borderline tumors.
gThe AAPC is statistically significantly different from zero (2-sided Z test; P < .05).

dRates are per 100,000 persons and were age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups: ages <1 year, 1–4 years, 5–9 years, …, 80–84 years, ≥85 years; Census publication p25-1130 [US Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports, p25-1130. 
Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office; 2000]).
eThe AAPC is a weighted average of the annual percent change and is calculated by joinpoint analyses with up to 2 joinpoints yielding up to 3 trend segments based on rates per 100,000 persons and age adjusted to the 2000 US standard population (19 age groups; Census 
publication p25-1130). For joinpoint analysis, the Joinpoint Regression Program was used (version 4.2.0.0, April 2015; Statistical Research and Applications Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD).
fThe AAPC is statistically significantly different from zero (2-sided Z test; P < .05).
gThe statistic could not be calculated. The AAPC is based on <10 cases for at least 1 year within the time interval.
