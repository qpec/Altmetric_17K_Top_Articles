Background: This study aimed at exploring whether moderate
ethanol drinking may have adverse effects on the fatty acids
composition and on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of rat brain. A
secondary aim was to examine whether dietary antioxidant an-
thocyanins (ACN) can be protective.
Methods: One group of rats received ethanol 12% and another
water as an exclusive liquid to drink for 8 weeks. In order to test
the impact of ACN consumption, two other groups of rats were fed
an ACN-rich diet in combination with either ethanol or water.
Brain fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography and
mtDNA alterations, markers of mitochondrial suffering, were
studied through an original real-time qPCR-based protocol.
Results: Linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) and eicosadienoic acid (20:2n-
6) were significantly decreased, by 12% and 31% respectively, in the
brains of both ethanol groups. The other brain lipids, including
arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,
were
not modified.

1. Introduction
Heavy ethanol drinking is thought to result in adverse effects on the brain [5,8,10,19,25]. Among
these effects, ethanol may alter the metabolism of some brain fatty acids. Pawlosky reported that the
brains of chronic alcohol-exposed cats [17] and rhesus monkeys [16] exhibit reduced levels of
docosahexanoic acid (DHA or 22:6n-3), the main brain n-3, while docosapentaenoic acid (DPA or
22:5n-6) is increased, maybe due to a compensatory mechanism. This reciprocal change in the ratio of
22:6n-3 to 22:5n-6 is known to be associated with a loss in nervous system function [24] and may
provide a biochemical mechanism underlying some of the neuropathology associated with alco-
holism [16]. Arachidonic acid (AA or 20:4n-6), the main brain n-6, was unchanged in these two
studies [16,17].
Mitochondria are major targets for ethanol toxicity in different tissues [4,10,13], including the
brain [8,10,13]. Oxidative stress due to ethanol metabolization causes extensive degradation and
depletion of brain, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in mice. MtDNA,
which codes for 13 of the oxidative phosphorylation proteins, is more susceptible to oxidative
damage than nuclear DNA, due to the absence of protective histones and to its proximity with the
mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is the main cellular site of reactive oxygen species formation
in the cells. Thus ethanol-induced oxidative stress causes diverse mtDNA lesions, including oxidized
DNA bases, apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, as well as mtDNA strand breaks, resulting in mtDNA
depletion [4,10e12]. Among these lesions, the so-called mitochondrial mtDNA “common deletion”
(mtDNA-CD) is the most frequent and best characterized mutation in mtDNA. It is a large deletion of
4977 bp in humans (4834 bp in rats), affecting several genes coding for several subunits of NADH
dehydrogenase and one subunit of cytochrome oxidase. Even though deleted mtDNA represents
only a small fraction of the damage to mtDNA, a quantitative analysis of mtDNA-CD is considered to
be a sensitive and early marker for mitochondrial suffering [18]. Importantly, the ethanol-induced
mtDNA alterations might be prevented by antioxidants as vitamin E, melatonin or coenzyme Q10
[4,10,12].
The main goal of the present study was to test whether moderate chronic ethanol drinking could
induce a change in fatty acid metabolism and/or alterations of mtDNA in rat brains.
The second goal was to evaluate whether an anthocyanin (ACN)-rich diet can be protective. Despite
there is an emerging view that ACN may also act by modulating signaling pathways thereby impacting
the activity of metabolic pathways [14,15], the health benefits of ACN have been mostly attributed to
their antioxidant properties [21]. Therefore, they may have a protective effect against mtDNA lesions
induced by ethanol-oxidative stress. Our previous study on a rat model showed that an ACN-rich diet
induces a significant increase in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA or 20:5n-3) and DHA levels in plasma [23],
indicating that ACNs interact with the metabolism of n-3s. It was therefore hypothesized that ACN may
compensate for the possible decrease in brain DHA induced by ethanol, as previously described in cat
and monkey models [16,17].

 2. Material and methods
2.1. Animals and experimental protocols
Sixty male Wistar rats (1 month old, initial body weight 75e100 g) were purchased from Charles
River Laboratories. The animals were cared for according to the European Community Council Directive
L358-86/609/EEC on the care and use of laboratory animals. The protocols were performed under li-
cense from the French Ministry of Agriculture (license No. A380727) and approved by the local animal
ethics committee. The rats were housed under conditions of constant temperature, humidity and
standard lightedark cycle (12 h/12 h). Food and tap water were consumed ad libitum.
The rats were fed a standard diet (A04) while acclimating, before being distributed into the
experimental groups. In order to evaluate the effects of alcohol on brain fatty acid composition and
mtDNA, they received either tap water (CONT) or ethanol 12% (v/v in water) (ETH) as sole drinking
liquid for a period of 8 weeks.
In order to test the impact of ACN consumption on the same parameters, two other groups of rats
were fed an ACN-rich diet in combination with either tap water (ACN) or ethanol 12% (v/v) (ACN-ETH)
for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8-week dietary trials, the animals were anaesthetized with an intra-
peritoneal injection of pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). The whole brains were then rapidly excised and the
cerebellums were discarded. Brain samples were frozen and homogenized in a metallic mortar cooled
down in liquid nitrogen. The homogenates were aliquoted and stored at �80 �C for subsequent fatty
acid and mtDNA analysis.
2.2. ACN content of the food pellets
These experimental diets containing (ACN-rich) or not ACN (ACN-free) were prepared as previously
reported [22]. Briefly, the ACR genotype carried the R-r allele, conferring high anthocyanin accumu-
lation to the aleurone of the seed, whereas the r-D902 genotype (here referred to as r1) carried a
deletion containing the r1 locus and is totally devoid of pigment [22]. The ACR and r1 genotypes
previously in a W22 background were crossed to a commercial hybrid stock and the F1 progeny seeds
were used to produce 2 synthetic populations characterized by a high level (ACN-rich) or an absence of
ACN. Maize content from a standard pellet formula (A04, SAFE, France) was replaced by maize seed
powder obtained from either the ACR (ACN-rich) or the r1 genotype (ACN-free). Both diets were
equivalent in energy, with macronutrient concentrations of 67% carbohydrates, 23% protein and 10%
lipids (SAFE, France). Both the ACN-rich and ACN-free diets were similar in terms of fatty acid
composition [23]. Moreover, as previously reported [22], HPLC analyses showed that ACN were
detected in the ACN-rich seeds but were entirely absent from the ACN-free maize seeds. The same ACN
remained in the food pellets. Quantitative analyses indicated that the ACN-rich diet contained
~0.24 ± 0.01 mg of ACN/g of food pellets.
2.3. Brain fatty acids analysis
Brain lipids were extracted in hexane/isopropanol as previously described [6]. Briefly, methylated
fatty acids were extracted with hexane, separated and quantified by gas chromatography using an
Agilent Series Gas chromatography apparatus. Methyl ester peaks were identified by comparing their
retention time to those of a standard mixture. Saturated, mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acid levels
were expressed as a percentage of total fatty acid content.
2.4. Brain mtDNA analysis
The procedures used to perform a semi-quantitative analysis of total mtDNA and of mtDNA-CD have
been described previously [18]. Briefly, brain tissue was disrupted using a Retsch MM 301 mixer mill
(2 min, 30 Hz, 2-mm tungsten carbide bead) in 1 mL of 1X lysis buffer (Tween 20 0.05% v/v; NP40 0.05%
v/v; Tris HCl 10 mM pH 8) and proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. The
C. Demeilliers et al. / Clinical Nutrition Experimental 12 (2017) 11e19
13
 samples were incubated at 56 �C for 30 min and the proteinase K inactivated by heating at 98 �C for
15 min.
The lysate was diluted as previously described [18]. These dilution steps were performed in order to
homogenize the detergent present in the lysis buffer and to obtain reproducible qPCR efficiency. The
LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche) was used to perform qPCR analysis. Each qPCR
reaction was carried out using 5 ml of final lysate, 7 mM of MgCl2 and 0.4 mM of both forward and reverse
primers. Forward and reverse primers were as follows: for mtDNA 50-GGGTTAAAAACCGACGCAATC-30
and 50-AATGGGTATGAAGCTGTGATTTGAG-30; for deleted mtDNA 50-TCAGCAACCGACTACACTCATTTC-30
and 50- AGTTATGGATGTGGCGATTAAAGTG-30; for GAPDH 50-CCTGTTCATCCCTCCACACATC-30 and 50-
CCAGTGATTTTCCAGCCCTAATC-30. The PCR was performed using a Lightcycler (Roche) for 45 cycles at
95 �C for 20 s, 54 �C for 5 s, and 72 �C for 8 s. All assays were carried out in duplicate. For each sample,
PCR efficiency was assessed using the LinRegPCR software. The relative quantification was then achieved
using the comparative threshold cycle method, with efficiency correction using the average value of
measured PCR efficiencies. The data are expressed using arbitrary relative units, depending on the
calibrator value [18].
2.5. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done with Stata 12™ (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas). The data are
expressed as mean ± SEM. Comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA followed, when
authorized, by contrast analysis using Bonferroni correction. P values < 0.05 were considered statis-
tically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Food consumption and body weight
The food consumption is 22,5 ± 0,6 g/j (i.e ~64 kcal), 21,8 ± 0,2 g/j (i.e ~62 kcal), 16,6 ± 0,5 g/j (i.e
~47 kcal) and 18,8 ± 1,1 g/j (i.e ~53 kcal) respectively for control, ACN, ethanol and ethanol þ ACN. The
reduction of food intake on the rats exposed to alcohol is balanced by the alcohol intake which provides
~12 kcal per day.
The evolution of the body weight did not differ significantly between the control andthe ACN-rich diet
groups (Fig.1). However, a longitudinal analysis show that ethanol has significant negative effect on body
weight evolution (p ¼ 0.001 by a GEE population-averaged model). For example, at the 8th week, the
weight gain is 266 g ± 8 for the control rats, whereas is 246 g ± 7 for the rats receiving ethanol (p ¼ 0.046).
Interestingly, the group receiving ethanol and ACN did not differ significantly from the control.

 3.2. Effects of ethanol and an ACN-rich diet on brain fatty acids
Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids did not differ between groups (Table 1). Regarding
polyunsaturated fatty acids, in particular AA (20:4n-6) and DHA (22:6n-3), we found no difference
between groups (Table 1). However, two minor brain n-6 fatty acids, linoleic acid (LA or 18:2n-6) and
eicosadienoic acid (EDA or 20:2n-6), were significantly decreased in the two groups that had consumed
ethanol (Table 1). LA decreased by 12% and 20% respectively in the ETH and ACN-ETH groups, whereas
EDA decreased by 31% and 38%. No other significant difference was observed (Table 1).
3.3. Effects of ethanol and an ACN-rich diet on brain mtDNA
We observed no significant change in the mtDNA/GAPDH ratio, and therefore no mtDNA depletion
in the ethanol groups (Fig. 2A). However, the deleted mtDNA/total mtDNA ratio increased significantly
in the ethanol group (by 28%, Fig. 2B) as compared with the control (p < 0.05). There was no significant
difference between CONT and both the ACN and ACN-ETH groups.
4. Discussion
In this study in rats, we examined whether moderate ethanol drinking may be harmful for the brain.
Two issues were examined: brain fatty acid composition and mtDNA alterations. Ethanol exposure over
a period of 8 weeks resulted in a minor but significant changes in two n-6 fatty acids and in an increase
in mtDNA-CD in the brain. The metabolism of other fatty acids, including n-3s, was not modified. We
also observed that an ACN-rich diet could prevent the apparition of mtDNA-CD, but did not result in
any change in n-6.
4.1. Ethanol and brain fatty acid composition
In our rat model, moderate ethanol drinking did not result in any significant variation in ALA (18:3n-
3), DHA and total n-3s. However, two minor brain n-6 fatty acids (LA or 18:2n-6 and EDA or 20:2n-6)
significantly decreased in the two groups following ethanol consumption (Table 1). These results are
partly in line with those observed in humans [3]. We actually showed a progressive decline in LA

 plasma levels with increased wine ethanol intake, whereas ALA and DHA were unchanged regardless of
ethanol consumption. In the present study, the decrease of LA (18:2n-6) and EDA (20:2n-6) was
probably a compensatory mechanism with no decrease in AA (20:4n-6), a major second messenger in
brain [2,7,20]. Ethanol was shown to induce a release of AA and its metabolites [1,9] by the activation of
phospholipase A2 in brain rodents [1]. This could alter membrane physiology and be involved in
ethanol tolerance and dependence. We hypothesize that LA (18:2n-6) was preferentially consumed to
synthesize AA in order to maintain a constant AA level. Thus, LA slightly decreased in brain lipids, while
the AA concentration remains unchanged at least in the short term.
Our study was in apparent contradiction with the results of Pawlosky, who showed that ethanol
intoxication significantly decreases DHA concentration in the brains and retinas of felines and in the
brains of rhesus monkeys [16]. In addition to the loss of DHA, a significant increase in DPA was also
observed. This lipid change is associated with a loss in nervous system function [24] and may provide a
biochemical mechanism underlying some of the neuropathology associated with alcoholism [16]. In
these two studies, however, the duration of alcohol intake was much longer than in our 8-week study,
namely 2,5 years [16] and 6e8 months [17]. Finally, the present study examined fatty acids in the whole

 brain; however, dissection of the various brain areas might have allowed detecting changes in fatty acid
composition following treatments.
Finally, the ACN-rich diet had no protective effect regarding the modification of brain fatty acids.
This does not contradict our previous study, in which we observed an interaction between ACN and
omega 3, but not between ACN and omega 6 metabolism [23].
4.2. Ethanol and brain mtDNA
In this study, mtDNA-CD in the brain increases after ethanol exposure, suggesting that brain
mitochondria have suffered.
Ethanol exposure increases the formation of reactive oxygen species by the mitochondria and this
may lead to oxidative damage of mtDNA [4,12]. Oxidative damage of DNA produces single-strand
breaks and favors slipped mispairing of repeated sequences during replication. This may explain the
occurrence of mtDNA-CD, which removes the DNA between two repeated sequences as well as one of
the repeated sequences. This mtDNA-CD cannot be repaired by the mitochondria, and therefore they
accumulate. Although mtDNA-CD has been extensively studied, it may be just one among many other
mtDNA mutations that are difficult to detect because of the low ratio of mtDNA with a given mutation
(i.e. oxidized DNA bases, apurinic/apyrimidic sites). Considering this “tip-of-the-iceberg” hypothesis
and the accumulation of this mtDNA-CD, a quantitative analysis of mtDNA-CD is considered to be a
sensitive and early marker for mitochondrial mutations and suffering and has been detected in the
liver of alcoholic patients [11]. Moreover, these diverse mtDNA lesions cause mtDNA depletion in
experimental animals [4,10,12]. Thus, in comprehensive molecular studies where mitochondrial dis-
orders can be involved, there is growing interest in a quantitative analysis of mtDNA-CD, in addition to
the determination of the total mtDNA content.
In our rat model, there is no depletion of mtDNA in any group. An adaptive synthesis of mtDNA
probably contributes in maintaining the mtDNA level, as already observed in other ethanol intoxication
model [4,10]. However, the mtDNA-CD/total mtDNA ratio significantly increased after ethanol drinking
as compared with controls, which may be due to an alcohol-induced oxidative stress. As a matter of
fact, when ethanol was associated with an ACN-rich diet known for its antioxidant effect [21], the
accumulation of mtDNA-CD was not significantly different from the control.
4.3. Limitations of the study
First, the amount, duration and route of ethanol administration may influence the tissue concen-
tration of polyunsaturated fatty acids. This may in turn explain the apparent contradiction with
Pawlosky's findings [16,17]. Also, the animal species, the amount of ethanol and the duration of the
ethanol exposure were not the same in this study and in Pawlosky's, and thus the adaptive mechanism
was probably different.
Second, we did not investigate the effect of ethanol intoxication on mitochondrial function. Taking
mitochondrial heteroplasmy into account, we cannot say if there is a significant consequence of the
accumulation of mtDNA-CD on the mitochondrial respiration rate or on the permeability transition
pore. Our aim was to identify a possible harmful effect on the brain, as shown through measurements
of a marker of mitochondrial suffering, but not a specific functional parameter. Further studies are
required to explore these functional issues.
Third, additional studies are required to understand at which level of their metabolism (intestinal
absorption, regulation of lipolysis and lipogenesis, whole-body fuel utilization, regulation of n-6
elongation and desaturation) ethanol and n-6 interact.
5. Conclusions
In this study, we have shown that ethanol leads to a decrease in AA (18:2n-6) and EDA (20:2n-6)
levels in the brain. These changes were associated with increased mtDNA-CD, a marker of mito-
chondrial suffering. When ethanol was associated with an ACN-rich diet, there was no accumulation of
mtDNA-CD. However, the ACN-rich diet had no effect on the modification of brain fatty acid
