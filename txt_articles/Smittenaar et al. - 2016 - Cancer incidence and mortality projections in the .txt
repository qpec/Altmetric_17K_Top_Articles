Background: Cancer incidence and mortality projections are important for understanding the evolving landscape for cancer risk
factors as well as anticipating future burden on the health service.
Methods: We used an age–period–cohort model with natural cubic splines to estimate cancer cases and deaths from 2015 to 2035
based on 1979–2014 UK data. This was converted to rates using ONS population projections. Modified data sets were generated
for breast and prostate cancers.
Results: Cancer incidence rates are projected to decrease by 0.03% in males and increase by 0.11% in females yearly between
2015 and 2035; thyroid, liver, oral and kidney cancer are among the fastest accelerating cancers. 243 690 female and 270 261 male
cancer cases are projected for 2035. Breast and prostate cancers are projected to be the most common cancers among females
and males, respectively in 2035. Most cancers’ mortality rate is decreasing; there are notable increases for liver, oral and anal
cancer. For 2035, there are 95 961 female deaths projected and 116 585 male deaths projected.
Conclusions: These findings stress the need to continue efforts to address cancer risk factors. Furthermore, the increased burden
of the number of cancer cases and deaths as a result of the growing and ageing population should be taken into consideration by
healthcare planners.
Incidence and mortality measures are an important part of cancer
control monitoring. These two measures can be further char-
acterised in terms of rates and cases. Age-standardised rates
describe cancer incidence and mortality with reference to a
standard population making this a measure which is invariant to
the size and age composition of the population. Incidence rates can
act as a crude proxy for shifting patterns of the prevalence
of risk factors linked to the disease within a population.
Overdiagnosis can also contribute to increased cancer incidence
(Welch and Black, 2010).
Mortality rates are influenced by incidence rates, and also how
successful the healthcare system is in diagnosing and treating the
cancer under study. However, the relationship between mortality
and incidence rates is complex; not all cancer patients will die from
their cancer, and survival is improving over time for the majority
of cancers. For those that do die from their cancer, there is a time
lag between the diagnosis and death, which for many could
be several years. Relative survival provides a more accurate
measurement of how effective a healthcare system is in diagnosing
and treating diseases, as it accounts for the background mortality
in the population under study (Ellis et al, 2014). However, survival
measures are prone to ‘lead time bias’, whereby the increased
intensity of screening and early diagnosis activities results in many
more cancers being diagnosed at an earlier stage (and so potentially
extending survival time for cancers without impacting the outcome
of the disease; Duffy et al, 2008). Screening and awareness
measures can also lead to overdiagnosis of some cancers (Welch
and Black, 2010), which will artificially improve survival estimates.
Understanding changes in incidence and mortality rates is
therefore important to public health scientists, as this provides a
means with which to evaluate public health interventions. When
the risk factors for the development of certain cancers are poorly
understood, projections may be the only information available
regarding anticipated future burden of the disease.
The number of cancer cases or deaths is the total number of
people within a population who have either been diagnosed with or

 die from cancer, and this is greatly influenced by the size and age
composition of the population. This information is critical to
understanding and planning for the disease burden.
Here, we used an age–period–cohort (APC) model on current
cancer incidence and mortality data for 26 cancer sites and an
‘other’ cancer category to extrapolate future trends until 2035. In
contrast to predictions, projections do not explicitly include
assumptions about changes in risk factors or screening activity
for incidence projections, or improvements to treatment for
mortality
projections
(Mistry
et
al,
2011).
Although
there
is a strong link between smoking and lung cancer (Parkin et al,
2011), for the majority of cancers the relationship between a single
or combination of risk factors is insufficiently strong to be
modelled directly (Bray and Møller, 2006). Analogously, improve-
ments in treatments are not modelled directly as they tend to have
incremental effects on the mortality rates as opposed to more
radical
changes,
which
we
would
anticipate
were
a
cure
to be found. By taking account of age, calendar period and birth
cohort, the APC models are able to incorporate historical
changes in these components (for example, different risk factor
prevalence among different birth cohorts) to make longer term
projections (Møller et al, 2003; Sedjo et al, 2007; Olsen et al, 2008).
This paper builds on incidence projections for the United Kingdom
(UK) presented by Mistry et al (2011) by updating with an
additional 7 years of data. We additionally present mortality
projections.
Furthermore,
we
provide
information
on
case
ascertainment from 2000 onwards, sensitivity analyses exploring
the impact of several model parameters, projection intervals, as
well as a comparison between projections using two standardised
populations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used data on the incidence and mortality of 26 cancer sites and
for each sex an ‘other’ cancer category (see Supplementary Material
A). The ‘other’ cancer category is likely to contain a number of
different trends of the various cancers it contains which makes
modelling more error-prone. However, we have included this
category in our analysis as it contains a large proportion of cancer
cases and deaths contributing to the ‘all cancers’ number. To
exclude it would result in an under-estimation of these numbers.
The cancer incidence data used for England from 1979 to 2014
were supplied by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) who
received the registration data collected by the National Cancer
Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS). The incidence data
from 1979 to 2014 for Wales were provided by the Welsh Cancer
Intelligence Surveillance Unit (WCISU), and for Scotland by the
Information Services Division (ISD) Scotland cancer information
programme. The Northern Ireland incidence data are for 1993–
2014 and were provided by the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry
(NICR). Earlier incidence data for Northern Ireland are not reliable
as the NICR was established in 1993. For data between 1979 and
1992, we scaled Great Britain (GB) data up to the level of the UK,
by calculating the proportion of the UK population which GB
constituted each year by sex and 5 year age band, and used this to
scale up the GB incidence to UK level.
The cancer mortality data for England and Wales between 1979
and 2014 were provided (and collected) by the ONS. For Scotland,
the data were provided by the Scottish Cancer Registry and
collected by the General Register Office (GRO) for Scotland.
Cancer mortality data for Northern Ireland were obtained from the
NICR (and collected by the Northern Ireland Statistics and
Research Agency (NISRA)). Mesothelioma mortality data are an
exception. They were provided by the Health and Safety Executive
for Great Britain between 1979 and 2014. We used the above
scaling method to scale this GB level data up to the level of the UK
for 1979–2014.
Incidence and mortality data were split into the number of cases
by 5 year age group and sex. Population estimates and projections
for GB and the UK by 5 year age groups were obtained from the
ONS Population Services. All modelling was completed by 5 year
age groups. The age groups were as follows; 15–19, 20–24, 25–29,
30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74,
75–79, 80–84, 85–89, 90 þ . We did not model 0–4, 5–9 or 10–14
age groups. There are so few cancer cases and deaths in these age
groups that including them would have made the data sparser and
therefore had a negative impact on model fitting. Our observed and
projected age-standardised rates (ASRs) are for those aged
15–90 þ , and so will be higher than ASRs for those aged
0–90 þ . This is also due to the relatively low amount of cases
and deaths in the 0–14 age group; by removing these age groups
where the risk of being diagnosed with or dying from cancer is very
low, rates for the 15–90 þ age group are higher as the population
the rates are based on has an at least slightly elevated risk of being
diagnosed with or dying from cancer in comparison with the 0–14
age groups. Therefore the ASRs in this paper are not directly
comparable to ASRs calculated for people aged 0–90 þ . Weights
from the European Standard Population 2013 (ESP 2013) were
used to age-standardise these rates. The oldest age group in the
cancer incidence and mortality data is 90 þ , whereas the ESP 2013
has categories for 90–94 and 95 þ , and therefore we summed the
weights of these categories for the 90 þ age group.
We used an APC model to model incidence and mortality for
each cancer, and then this was extrapolated out to 2035. The basic
form of the APC model is:
l age; period
ð
Þ ¼ g fa age
ð
Þ þ fp period
ð
Þ þ fc cohort
ð
Þ
�
�
;
in which l corresponds to the incidence or mortality rate as a
function of age and calendar period, g is a ‘link’ function (either the
‘power 5’ function, g(x) ¼ x5 (Møller et al, 2002) or a log link
function), and functions of age (fa), period (fp) in terms of year of
incidence, and cohort (fc) in terms of year of birth. The functions
fa, fp and fc are natural cubic splines. Natural cubic splines are
favoured over step functions, because natural cubic splines are
flexible, and reflect smooth changes over time, which allow a more
biologically plausible way of modelling non-communicable disease
data. The APC model contains the date of birth and age of
diagnosis (tabulated by 5 year groups), which sum to give the date
of diagnosis (i.e., there is a linear dependence between age, period
and cohort). Therefore, the model suffers from the identifiability
problem. To address this issue, cubic splines were used to absorb
the linear trends in period and cohort effects into a drift
component. A linear extrapolation was then used beyond the final
knot in the spline to project this drift component into the future,
with an attenuation applied to this, based on the assumption that
these historical trends will not continue indefinitely (Møller et al,
2002; Mistry et al, 2011; Sasieni, 2012).
We completed sensitivity analyses to determine which combi-
nation of either a log or power 5 link function, the number of knots
in each of the cubic splines and the attenuation of the drift
component was best able to project data over the period of 1999–
2014 using a data set that was truncated at 1998. We assumed that
the combination of model parameters which provided the most
accurate projections using historical data are the most appropriate
model parameters for projecting using the current data set (see
Supplementary Materials B, B.1 and B.2 for further details). For the
incidence data, we used a log link function, with seven, five and
three knots in the age, period and cohort splines, respectively, and
with a 10% year-on-year attenuation on the drift component. For
the mortality data, we used a log link function, with six, five and

 three knots in the age, period and cohort splines, respectively, and
with a 6% year-on-year attenuation on the drift component.
The APC model is available as a function to download in
STATA 13 (Mistry et al, 2011). All other code for this analysis was
developed in-house in STATA 13.
In line with Mistry et al, 2011, our methodology takes account
of changes relating to screening for breast and prostate cancer. We
generated modified data sets to estimate the underlying incidence
trends in these cancers before screening, as well as estimated the
increases attributable to screening. We used data from the period
1979–1991 – before the introduction of prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) testing – to model incidence trends in the absence of PSA
testing. We used the assumptions of Mistry et al (2011) that PSA
testing reached a steady state in 2004, and would continue at this
level. To estimate the impact PSA testing had in 2004–2014, we
first predicted these rates in the absence of any PSA testing (from
projections based on 1979–1991 data). We then used these
predicted rates to calculate age-specific observed/predicted ratios.
We divided case numbers from 2004 to 2014 by these ratios to
estimate cases in the absence of PSA testing. The projections for
2015–2035 were made by fitting the APC model to the 1975–1991
data, and also the modified data set from 2004 to 2014 and
multiplying the model projections for 2004–2035 by the previously
calculated observed/predicted ratios.
We used an age-stratified approach for breast cancer whereby
we used data from before screening was offered to that particular
age group of women (50–64 years during 1989–1996, 65–69 years
during 1990–1997 and 2003–2014, and 70–74 years during 2004–
2014) to estimate the rates when the screening programme reached
a steady state in the specific age group. The observed/predicted
ratio was used to adjust subsequent data from when the screening
programmes were in place to make the projections until 2035. The
projections for 2015–2035 were then multiplied by these observed/
predicted ratios.
The ‘all cancers’ numbers for incidence cases, and mortality
deaths were compiled by summing the 26 cancers types and ‘other’
cancer
categories
for
each
sex,
following
modelling
these
individually. The model predicts the number of cases or deaths.
We converted this into incidence or mortality rates by dividing the
projected number of cases or deaths by the population for each age
band, and multiplying this by 100 000. Age-standardised rates
(ASRs) for incidence and mortality were generated by performing
weighted means using the European Standard Population (ESP)
2013. ASRs were calculated by age group, sex and site.
RESULTS
Incidence
Projected rates. Figure 1 displays observed trends (1979–2014,
denoted by dots) and projections (2015–2035, denoted by a solid
line) of age-standardised cancer incidence rates for males and
females separately split down by age groups (all ages, 15–24, 25–49,
50–64, 65–74, 75 þ ) for all cancer sites combined.
Figures for trends and projections by cancer site can be seen in
Supplementary Material C. Cancers with similar incidence are
grouped together so that y axes are comparable. We used log
likelihood to assess model fit (see Supplementary Material D).
Projected data from 2015 to 2035 suggests that overall incidence
ASR will increase by an average annual percentage of 0.07%, which
corresponds to average annual decrease in males of 0.03%, and an
increase in females of 0.11% (see Table 1).
Table 1 demonstrates that these changes in ASR for all cancers
belies a complex pattern of increases and decreases in specific
cancer types. In terms of average annual percentage change,
thyroid cancer is the fastest accelerating cancer (males: 2.49%,
females: 2.34%). Other cancers that are projected to accelerate
quickly include oral cancer (males: 1.10%, females: 1.15%),
kidney cancer (males: 1.08%, females: 0.70%), liver cancer
(males: 1.41%, females: 0.52%) and anal cancer (males: 0.62%,
females: 1.92%). For females only, large average annual percentage
changes in cervical cancer (1.65%) incidence are projected. More
modest increases are projected for Hodgkin lymphoma (males:
0.52%, females: 0.14%) and malignant melanoma (males: 0.26%,
females: 0.29%).
Table 1 also demonstrates that for some cancers, opposite
patterns of increasing and decreasing average annual percentage
change in incidence rates are found between males and females.
These include bone (males: � 1.91%, females: 0.85%), leukaemia
(males: 0.13%, females:
� 0.16%), oesophagal cancer (males:
� 0.31%, females: 0.02%), as well as the ‘other’ cancer category
(males: 0.22, females: � 0.13%). For the remaining cancers, average
annual percentage changes in incidence ASR were either small or
constant.
Age-specific
trends
in
incidence
rates. Inspection
of
Supplementary Material C demonstrates that for the majority of
cancers, incidence is higher for those in the 75 þ age group. As
such, changes in incidence ASRs are often a result of large changes
in this age group, whereas the other age groups remain relatively
constant. However, some cancers do not follow this pattern. For
male and female thyroid cancer, increases were seen in all age
groups. For males, the 65–74 age group is projected to increase
higher than the 75 þ age group; and for females, the 65–74, 50–64
and 25–49 age groups are all projected to rise higher than the 75 þ
age group. Similarly, for male oral cancer, the 65–74 age group is
projected to increase more than the oldest age group. For some
cancers, there is evidence of differing trends between the age
groups. Overall increases are projected for ovary cancer due to
increases in the 50–64 and 65–74 age groups, however, rates are
projected to decrease in the 75 þ age group. Similarly, substantial
reductions in cervix cancer are projected for the 75 þ age group,
however, the overall increase is driven by changes in the 25–49 and
50–64 age groups. Notably for Hodgkin lymphoma, the youngest
age group is projected to have the highest incidence over the
period.
Projected cases. The total increase in cancer cases between 2014
and 2035 is 42.47% (corresponding to an average annual increase
of 1.63%). Table 1 demonstrates that this increase in cancer cases is
disproportionately projected for males (48.42%) compared with
females (36.41%). These massive changes in the absolute number

 of cancer cases forecasted for the period 2014–2035 are mainly a
result of the growing and ageing population.
Table 1 demonstrates that there are a number of cancers where
large increases in the average annual percentage change in the
number of cases for both males and females were projected. These
include anal cancer (males: 2.01%, females: 3.09%), kidney cancer
(males: 2.75%, females: 2.17%), leukaemia (males: 2.11%, females
1.52%), liver cancer (males: 3.28%, females: 2.38%), myeloma
(males: 2.35%, females: 1.90%), oral cancer (males: 2.22%, females:
2.37%), pancreas cancer (males: 2.19%, females: 1.91%), stomach
cancer (males: 0.89%, females: 1.30%) and thyroid cancer (males:
3.42%, females: 2.88%). For males only, prostate cancer had a
substantial average annual percentage increase in cases at 2.34%.
Mesothelioma cases are projected to decrease over the period
2015–2035 (males:
� 1.42%, females:
� 1.17%) per year on
average. Bone cancer cases are also projected to decrease for males
( � 0.84%) over this period, but to increase for females (1.77%). All
other cancers had relatively smaller average annual percentage
increases.

 population in 1993, 2014 and 2035. The size of the doughnut is
scaled to reflect the total number of cancer cases in that year. For
females, proportions of different cancers remain stable over time,
with breast having the greatest proportion of cases for each of these
years. In the most recent data available in 2014, lung cancer
replaces bowel cancer as the second most common cancer, a trend
which is set to continue until 2035. The trend for uterus cancer
being a more common cancer is projected to continue.
In contrast for males, Figure 2 demonstrates that there are
noticeable decreases in the proportion of lung cancer cases over the
period. Replacing lung cancer in 1993, prostate cancer has become
the most common cancer in men in 2014, and this is projected to
continue until 2035. For bladder cancer, there is a trend for a
decreasing proportion of cases with time. Conversely, kidney
cancer and malignant melanoma are showing an increase in the
proportion of cases, and this is projected to continue.
Mortality
Projected rates. Figure 3 displays trends (1979–2014, denoted by
dots) and projections (1979–2035, denoted by a solid line) of
age-standardised cancer mortality rates for males and females
separately split down by age groups (all ages, 15–24, 25–49, 20–64,
65–74, 75 þ ) for all cancers combined. Overall, the mortality ASR
will fall 15.30% between 2014 and 2035, with males declining by
18.33% and females by 14.57%.
Supplementary Material E shows this information for each
cancer site. We used log likelihood to assess model fit (see
Supplementary Material D).
We calculated the average annual percentage change in
mortality ASR (see Table 2). The cancers with the fastest
accelerating average annual increases in mortality rates are liver
cancer (males: 1.99%, females: 1.79%), oral cancer (males: 1.42%,
females: 1.53%) and anal cancer (males: 1.81%, females: 2.28%),
and bone cancer for females (0.79%). More modest increases in
average annual percentage change in mortality ASR are also noted
for thyroid cancer in females (0.52%), though this is decreasing
slightly in males ( � 0.27%). For females, there are increases in
average annual percentage change mortality ASR in uterine cancer
(0.73%) and laryngeal cancer (0.77%).
For all other cancers, the mortality rates are either relatively
constant, or projected to decrease between 2015 and 2035 (see
Table 2). The largest projected decrease in average annual
percentage change in mortality ASR is in mesothelioma (males:
� 3.54%, females: � 2.41%).
Age-specific trends. For the majority of cancers, the overall trend
is driven by changes in the 75 þ age group, which is largely due to
the incidence burden being the highest among this age group.
It was noted that incidence rates of cervical cancer were rising
most sharply in the 25–49 and 50–64 age groups, whereas a decline
in incidence rates are projected for the 75 þ age group. However,
the mortality data displayed in Supplementary Material E suggest
that the mortality rate is decreasing in all age groups, despite the
increases in incidence noted.

 Supplementary Material E also shows that for liver cancer in
males, as well as the 75 þ age group, the 50–64 and 65–74 age
groups are contributing to the overall projected increases in
mortality ASR. A similar pattern is noted for oral cancer and anal
cancer, where these younger groups also contribute to the overall
increases in mortality ASR.
Projected deaths. The number of cancer deaths is projected to
increase 30.06% between 2014 and 2035. Table 2 demonstrates that this
overall percentage obscures the vast differences between the genders,
with a total increase in males of 35.04% and 24.48% in females. These
increases are largely driven by shifting population demographics, as the
opposite trends tend to be observed in mortality ASRs.
Large average annual percentage increases in deaths are
predicted from liver cancer (males: 4.03%, females 3.76%), in anal
cancer (males: 3.67%, females 3.75%), in oral cancer (males: 2.97%,
females 3.09%), in pancreatic cancer (males: 2.06%, females: 1.58%)
and in thyroid cancer (males: 1.91%, females 2.35%). For males,
prostate cancer deaths are projected to increase by an average of
2.38% per year; and for females, uterine cancer deaths are projected
to increase by 2.61% per year, on average. Mesothelioma is the only
cancer where the annual average number of deaths is projected to
decrease for both sexes (males � 0.90%, females � 0.21%). For
males only, a reduction in the average annual number of deaths is
projected for bone ( � 0.07%) and testicular ( � 0.79%) cancer. For
females only, a reduction in Hodgkin lymphoma ( � 0.61%) and
ovarian cancer ( � 0.48%) were projected over this period.
Cancer mortality: past, present and future. Figure 4 demonstrates
the proportions of cancer deaths in 1993, 2014 and 2035. The size
of the doughnut is scaled to reflect the total number of cancer
deaths in that year. For women, as a consequence of lung cancer
having increased incidence, it is the most common cancer death
among women in 2014, and this trend is projected to continue to
2035. From 2014 to 2035, uterine cancer is projected to increase
from the ninth most common cancer death in women, to the sixth,
which again reflects the increased incidence of uterine cancer.
For men, lung cancer is the most common cancer death
throughout this period. Stomach and bladder cancer become less
common causes of cancer death between 1993 and 2014, and this is
projected to decrease even further. For both pancreatic and liver
cancer, the proportion of deaths attributable to these cancer types
is projected to rise over this period. Incidence rates for both these
cancers is increasing, and here they are projected to increase even
more between 2015 and 2035, which means, in the context of
relatively little treatment improvements for these cancers, we can
expect a greater proportion of cancer deaths to be as a result of
these cancers.
DISCUSSION
Here we show projections of cancer incidence rates until 2035
demonstrating a small increase for females, and a very slight
decrease for males. We have projected that overall mortality rates
for both males and females will decline over the same period.
The overall number of cancer cases and deaths will increase
substantially over this period, which is largely a result of the
increasing population size and the ageing population.
Notably, our findings contrast to the findings of Mistry et al
(2011), who report a gradual levelling off of the incidence ASR for
all cancers combined, with rates falling by 1% in males and 1.9% in
females. Mistry et al (2011) used the European standardised
population from 1976 (Waterhouse et al, 1976), whereas we have
used an updated version for 2013 (Eurostat, 2013). As the ESP
2013 gives older age categories more weight than the ESP 1976, this
will amplify the incidence and mortality rates as cancer is
disproportionately diagnosed in older age groups. We have
compared the impact of using the ESP 2013 and ESP 1976
(Supplementary Materials F, F.1 and F.2). This demonstrates that
although using the ESP 1976 for age-standardisation results in
lower rates for the majority of cancers, trends seen when using ESP
2013 are similar to those observed when using ESP 1976. This
suggests that there are genuine increases in rates, and this is not
simply an artefact of the different age-standardisation weights.
There have been recent increases in the prevalence of risk factors
associated with cancer such as being overweight and obese (Health
and Social Care Information Centre, 2012), which may explain
these increases in incidence rates.
Incidence data sets have year-on-year changes owing to late
registrations. These have previously been shown to cause an
artificial downward trend in incidence for the most recent years
(Oliver et al, 2013). In Supplementary Materials G, G.1 and G.2, we
examine the extent of late registration in cancer registration data
sets between 2000 and 2014. Both bone cancer and leukaemia show
a discrepant result between males and females, where incidence
ASR is decreasing in males and increasing in females. As there are
no risk factors strongly associated with the development of either
of these cancers, it is difficult to explain these patterns. However, as
highlighted in Supplementary Material G.2, these cancers are the
most affected by the late-registration problem, which may
artificially decrease the rates. As a result of this potential data
quality issue, firm conclusions cannot be drawn for these cancers
from the pattern of projections presented here.
We did not create modified data sets for either bowel or cervical
cancer, although there are screening programmes for these cancers.
Besides early detection of cancer, these screening programmes are a
means of primary prevention through the identification and
removal of pre-cancerous lesions. The cervical screening pro-
gramme has been established since 1988 and its benefits on
incidence and mortality are evident in the data, and therefore will
be reflected in the projections. Previous modelling research on the
bowel screening programme suggests the programme will cause
incidence rates to increase until 2017, following which incidence
will begin to decrease (Parkin et al, 2008). As such, there is no
benefit in creating modified data sets to model the underlying
trends in incidence rates in the absence of the additional cases
resulting from screening activity, as it is intended that the
screening
will
affect
these
underlying
rates.
Bowel
cancer
projections should therefore be interpreted with caution. Future
bowel cancer incidence may be overestimated in the projections, as
typically there is a prevalence wave following the introduction of a
screening programme. Owing to the time lag between screening
benefits and its impact on mortality, it is likely the current
mortality data set reflects little, if any, benefit of the screening
programme, and therefore these mortality projections may provide
a reference point to evaluate the effectiveness of the screening
programme.
Increases in incidence and mortality have been noted for
cancers associated with the human papilloma virus (HPV),
including oral, anal and cervical cancer. However, the benefits of
the HPV vaccination programme have not yet been realised. The
vaccination programme was introduced throughout UK in 2008,
offering the vaccine to 12–13-year-old girls. Therefore these
projections could act as a benchmark to evaluate the efficacy of
the vaccine, as its impact is not yet reflected in the data.
Liver cancer incidence and mortality is projected to increase.
There are numerous risk factors associated with the development
of liver cancer including obesity, alcohol and the hepatitis infection
(Parkin et al, 2011). However, there is poor concordance between
initial diagnosis of liver cancer and death certificate information
for liver cancer (Lund et al, 2010). This may be because the liver is
a frequent site of metastasis, so many cancer deaths are recorded as
liver cancer deaths even when this is not the primary site. This may
BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
UK cancer incidence and mortality 2035 projections
1152
www.bjcancer.com | DOI:10.1038/bjc.2016.304
 mean that this is an artefactual increase in mortality. However,
given that liver cancer incidence is increasing and survival for this
cancer is relatively poor, it is possible this is a genuine increase in
liver cancer mortality.
Dramatic increases are projected for thyroid cancer, however,
there are no established risk factors for this cancer. Overdiagnosis
of thyroid cancer is often cited as a reason for the increases in
incidence rates observed for this disease (Lee and Shin, 2014).
However, here we additionally noted that for females, there are
small projected increases in mortality ASR. This may suggest that
overdiagnosis alone cannot explain all of the observed increases in
thyroid cancer.
It is also evident in the data and projections that men
disproportionately bear the burden of cancer. Despite the recent
observed increases in females, females are not projected to outstrip
men either in terms of incidence or mortality during this period.

UK cancer incidence and mortality 2035 projections

 This gender imbalance should be considered by public health
professionals when targeting interventions aimed at reducing the
burden of cancer.
There are assumptions and limitations associated with the
approach we have taken here. Supplementary Material B details the
process by which we selected the link function, geometric
dampening and the number of knots for each of the age, period
and cohort components. We assumed that the model that was able
to most accurately project the data over the period 1999–2014 would
provide the most accurate projections. The basis of the APC model
is that past trends will be continued into the future; however, the
pace of change over the coming years may be such that another
model would have been more appropriate. Furthermore, the
development of vaccines for certain cancers, or the development
of radical curative treatments could result in a drastic change in
cancer incidence and mortality, respectively. Our model does not
anticipate these profound changes. Therefore it is important that
projections are completed at regular intervals in order that the most
recent trends in the data can be captured. Different modelling
approaches, which attempt to explicitly model changes for cancers
where large breakthroughs in either treatment or prevention are
anticipated, would be a useful complement to this current work.
Despite attempts to optimise this model, there will still be error
associated with these projections, and we have presented a
projection interval in Supplementary Materials H, H.1 and H.2,
which attempts to quantify the extent of this uncertainty. Although
these projections are useful to provide estimate to healthcare
planners
regarding
what
the
future
burden of
the cancer
population will be, it is likely that these projections will deviate
from actual numbers the further into the future you look.
Projections completed at regular intervals, which incorporate the
most recent trends will help to minimise the error associated with
future projections of cancer burden.
Here we show projections of cancer incidence and mortality
until 2035. Projections of incidence demonstrate that the massive
efforts to reduce smoking prevalence should be continued, as lung
cancer still constitutes a large proportion of the cancer population.
In addition, greater efforts are required to tackle other risk factors
such as alcohol, overweight and obesity, the hepatitis infection and
HPV, as the incidence of numerous cancers linked to these risk
factors is also set to increase. Finally, the projected number of cases
and deaths demonstrates the massive burden that cancer will be,
which should be planned for accordingly.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We acknowledge the work of the cancer registries in the United
Kingdom Association of Cancer Registries. Without their work,
there would be no incidence data. In addition, we thank Alice
Cotelli and Lauren Richardson for their help in preparing these
figures for publication, and our organisation, Cancer Research UK.
