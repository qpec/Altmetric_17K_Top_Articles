Abstract
Mental illness-related stigma, including that which exists in the healthcare system and among healthcare providers, creates serious
barriers to access and quality care. It is also a major concern for healthcare practitioners themselves, both as a workplace culture
issue and as a barrier for help seeking. This article provides an overview of the main barriers to access and quality care created by
stigmatization in healthcare, a consideration of contributing factors, and a summary of Canadian-based research into promising
practices and approaches to combatting stigma in healthcare environments.
Introduction
Mental illness-related stigma, including that which exists in the
healthcare system and among healthcare providers, has been
identified as a major barrier to access treatment and recovery, as
well as poorer quality physical care for persons with mental
illnesses.1–5 Stigma also impacts help-seeking behaviours of
health providers themselves and negatively mediates their
work environment.6–9 What follows is a consideration of the
literature on the main sources of personal and interpersonal
stigma in healthcare, impacts for both patients and providers,
and evidence-based solutions that can be implemented to
improve patient-provider interactions and quality of care.
What are the main sources of stigma
in healthcare?
Developed from Goffman’s pioneering work,10 stigma is con-
ceptualized as a complex social process of labeling, othering,
devaluation, and discrimination involving an interconnection
of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural components.11,12
Stigmatization occurs on multiple levels simultaneously—
intrapersonal (eg, self-stigma), interpersonal (eg, relations with
others), and structural (eg, discriminatory and/or exclusionary
policies, laws, and systems).11–13 It is also keenly recognized
that only powerful social groups can stigmatize.11 Such an
understanding is helpful for appreciating how stigmatization
occurs on multiple levels throughout the healthcare sector,
including structural (eg, investment of resources, quality
of care standards, organizational culture), interpersonal (eg,
patient-provider interactions, discriminatory behaviours, neg-
ative attitudes), and intraindividual (eg self-stigma, patient
reluctance to seek care, provider reluctance to disclose a mental
illness and/or seek care).12,13
Research has identified a number of issues contributing to
stigmatization in healthcare, which have direct and indirect
impacts on access and quality of care for persons living with
mental illnesses. These have been described as ‘‘key learning
needs,’’14 acknowledging that they are specific concerns that
can be changed through targeted initiatives.
Negative attitudes and behaviours
People with lived experience of a mental illness commonly
report feeling devalued, dismissed, and dehumanized by many of
the health professionals with whom they come into contact.15–21
Key themes include feeling excluded from decisions, receiving
subtle or overt threats of coercive treatment, being made to wait
excessively long when seeking help, being given insufficient
information about one’s condition or treatment options, being
treated in a paternalistic or demeaning manner, being told they
would never get well, and being spoken to or about using stig-
matizing language.15–21 While research also highlights many
positive patient experiences (eg, Clark et al.19 Barney et al.20 and
Connor et al.21), the pervasiveness with which negative inter-
actions are reported suggests the problem is not isolated to a few
insensitive providers but is more systemic in nature—that it is a
problem with how healthcare culture prioritizes and perceives
persons with mental illnesses.1,4–7
Research with healthcare providers is consistent with this
idea, finding that stigmatizing attitudes and behaviours towards
persons with mental illnesses exist across the spectrum of
healthcare.2,5–7 Also, patients with certain disorders, such
as personality disorders, tend to be particularly rejected by
healthcare staff and are often felt to be difficult, manipulative,

 and less deserving of care.6,22–24 A Canadian qualitative
study14 articulated stigmatization among health providers to
be, at least in part, related to a tendency ‘‘see the illness ahead
of the person,’’ which can contribute to a failure to use person-
first language and/or a tendency to engage in behaviours that
may be experienced as dismissive or demeaning. Burnout
and compassion fatigue have been identified as exacerbating
concerns.2,14
Lack of awareness
Another issue is a lack of awareness and unconscious biases,
which acknowledge the power of hidden beliefs and attitudes
that can underlie stigma-related behaviour.14,25–28 Qualitative
research has found that for many healthcare providers, it is only
through the experience of receiving anti-stigma training that
they become aware of the subtle and unintended ways certain
beliefs and behaviours may have been contributing to stigma-
tizing experiences among their patients (Knaak et al.14 see also
Sukhera et al.25 and Horsfall et al.28)
Therapeutic pessimism
Research consistently demonstrates that healthcare providers
tend to hold pessimistic views about the reality and likelihood
of recovery, which is experienced as a source of stigma
and a barrier to recovery for people seeking help for mental
illnesses.2,6,7,12,29 Research also suggests that pessimism about
recovery for some providers is associated with a sense of
helplessness, leading them to believe that ‘‘what they do
doesn’t matter.’’14
Lack of skills
Inadequate skills and training seem to be associated with
stigmatization in two ways. First, it is believed to lead to
feelings of anxiety or fear and a desire for avoidance and social/
clinical distance among practitioners, which can negatively
impact patient-provider interactions and quality of care.6,29–31
Second, it can lead to less effective treatment and poorer
outcomes.2,6,32
Stigma in workplace culture
Importantly, the problem is not just outward facing—mental
illness-related stigma also permeates the healthcare sector as a
workplace. It has been described as a problem of culture, where
staff are often discouraged to talk openly or seek help for
psychological problems.1,6,8,9 Research with healthcare provi-
ders in Canada indicates that the level of stigma regarding their
own willingness to disclose and/or seek help for a mental ill-
ness is consistently higher than their level of stigma for other
dimensions such as negative attitudes and preference for social
distance.33 Also, within the workplace context, people with
mental illnesses are perceived as less competent, dangerous,
and unpredictable and that work itself is not good for people
with mental illnesses.34
Consequences of stigma for access
and quality care
These issues create barriers through such pathways as delays
in help-seeking, discontinuation of treatment, suboptimal
therapeutic relationships, patient safety concerns, and poorer
quality mental and physical care.1–2,12,35–37 For example,
anticipated stigma from healthcare providers has been identi-
fied as a factor in people’s reluctance to seek help for a
mental illness.12,15,19 Compromised patient-provider relation-
ships and early termination of treatment are also conse-
quences.2,5,15,16,38,39 A survey conducted by the Canadian
Psychiatric Association found that 79% reported first-hand
experiences of discrimination towards a patient and 53%
observed other medical providers, discriminating against a
patient from psychiatry.1 Stigma also has consequences for
patient safety.16,40 A recent Canadian study identified stigma as
a barrier to patient safety through factors such as staff attitudes
and institutional culture and the accepted marginalization of
mental health patients that occurs through stigmatization.40
Poorer physical care for persons with mental illnesses is
another consequence of stigmatization. Persons with lived
experience of a mental illness commonly report barriers to
having their physical care needs met, including not having their
symptoms taken seriously when seeking care for non-mental
health concerns.5,15–16,19 Studies also demonstrate that persons
with mental illness histories receive poorer quality care for
their physical health problems.29,35,37,41,42 This is believed to
occur largely through a process of diagnostic and treatment
overshadowing, whereby physical symptoms are misattributed
to a patient’s mental illness, creating delays in diagnoses and
treatment options.29
Stigmatization also has inward-facing impacts for health
professionals’ own willingness to seek help or disclose a
mental health problem, which can result in an over-reliance
on self-treatment, low peer support—including ostracization
and judgment from co-workers if disclosure does occur—and
increased risk of suicide.1,6,8,9,43 Given that mental illnesses
are related to presenteeism and productivity losses in the
workplace (eg, Dewa et al.44), it’s even more important to
consider the impact of stigma in this context. For example,
initial reluctance to seek help may result in decreased pro-
ductivity, which may lead to confirmation of stereotypes and
additional stigma by co-workers resulting in further reluc-
tance to seek help.
Removing barriers to access and care
through stigma reduction
The deleterious impacts of stigma in healthcare have promoted
increased calls to action for health organizations to take lead-
ership roles in tackling the problem.1,18,26,27,45–47 A growing
body of Canadian research has identified promising strategies
for stigma reduction in healthcare settings. For example, qua-
litative and theoretical models emphasize the importance of
approaching stigma reduction with the goal of culture change, a
112
Healthcare Management Forum
 dedication to taking a sustained, integrated approach to target
stigma from both outward- and inward-facing perspectives
(avoiding the temptation to employ one-off programming),
and committing to strong leadership support.14,27 Implemen-
tation models also emphasize mandatory and/or incentivized
participation, as well as the incorporation of stigma reduction
metrics into hospital and other accreditation processes as a
key measure for quality of care.3,14
Key ingredients for effective stigma reduction in healthcare
contexts have also been identified.48 It is believed the effec-
tiveness of these ingredients lies in the extent to which they are
able to address the sources of stigma describe above.14 These
include teaching skills that help healthcare providers know
‘‘what to say’’ and ‘‘what to do,’’ ensuring program facilitators
are modelling person-first behaviours and making ample use of
social contact.48 Social contact generally refers to hearing first-
voice testimonies from people with lived experience of a
mental illness who are trained to speak about their experi-
ences of illness and recovery, as well as their experiences
within the healthcare system, and is a key strategy for inter-
professional educational approaches to stigma reduction in
healthcare.48–50 It is a qualitatively different kind of contact
from typical provider-patient interactions. In social contact
approaches, people with lived experience of a mental illness
are seen not as patients but as educators.45,50–52 Social contact
has been shown to disconfirm stereotypes, diminish anxiety,
heighten empathy, make personal connections, and improve
understanding of recovery.50–52
Two other key ingredients have also been identified. The
first is providing interventions that include myth busting or a
transformative learning focus to target unconscious biases and
correct false beliefs that may be negatively impacting
care.25,27,48 The second is demonstrating/emphasizing recovery
from a mental illness and showing ways in which healthcare
providers play an impactful role in that process.48 More ful-
some implementation of person-centred recovery-oriented
models of care is also believed to be important.53–55
There is also a growing body of program-based Canadian
evaluation research with healthcare providers.25,31,45,52,56–64
Effective models include workshop-based interventions, skills-
based interventions, and intensive social contact interventions.
One workshop program showing promising results is a 2-hour
face-to-face delivered program called Understanding Stigma
developed by the Ontario Central Local Health Integration
Network.56,57 This program includes educational elements
designed to increase knowledge, skills, and awareness,
‘‘action-oriented’’ elements aimed at behaviour change, and
one or more social contact elements. It has been evaluated in
numerous settings with different healthcare audiences using a
pre-post follow-up design and the 15-item Opening Minds
Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC) scale, developed
specifically to measure attitudes and behavioural intentions of
healthcare providers towards persons with mental illnesses.33
Evaluation results show significant pre-post improvements in
all 3 factors of the OMS-HC, with changes being sustained at
3- and 6-month follow-up with the implementation of a
booster session.56,57
Another program demonstrating encouraging evaluation
results using the OMS-HC is a web-based accredited on-line
continuing medical education program called ‘‘Combating
Stigma,’’58,59 freely available at www.mdcme.ca. Participant
observation, human factors, and design thinking were pri-
mary methods informing the curriculum design, as the key
objective was to address the challenge that stigma is a largely
unperceived learning need for many health providers with
denied limitations in quality of care.59 While designed pri-
marily for physicians, evaluation data show that over half of
the program’s participants are nurses and allied health pro-
fessionals.59Asimilarprogramfornursestitled‘‘De-Stigmatizing
Practices and Mental Illness’’ is now available on the
www.mdcme.ca site.
The Working Mind (TWM) is a promising inward-facing
program being used in healthcare settings.64 Developed from
the Department of National Defence’s Road to Mental
Readiness Program,65 the primary objectives of TWM are to
reduce the stigma of mental illnesses, increase resiliency, and
promote early help seeking in program participants.47,64,65
Preliminary evaluation results indicate the program is effec-
tive at improving attitudes, encouraging people to seek help,
and increasing readiness to deal with stress and challenging
events,64 and is currently being adapted for resident doctors
and physicians.
Skills-based training also holds promise as a model for
reducing stigma. Skills-based interventions focus on beha-
viour change by aiming to improve confidence, comfort,
and understanding of mental illnesses as being inherently
treatable and manageable.14,48 One example is the Adult
Mental Health Practice Support Program developed in
British Columbia.30,31,60,64 The program teaches self-
management cognitive behavioural tools to family physi-
cians and other frontline healthcare providers for patients
with mild to moderate depression and anxiety. It aims to
reduce stigma through improved patient-provider interac-
tions and improved confidence and competence in working
with patients with mental illnesses.30
An evaluation of this program in British Columbia found
that physicians reported decreased reliance on prescribing
antidepressant medications, felt their patients were better able
to stay or return to work, and reported improved patient care.30
A randomized control study of this same program in Nova
Scotia found robust improvements in confidence and skills
compared to treatment-as-usual (TAU) and also a significant
reduction in social distance.31,64 Researchers also found
significantly lower Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9
depressive ratings among patients at 6-month follow-up and
significantly lower levels of anti-depressant prescribing
compared to TAU.64
Another important model is that of intensive social contact,
where health providers meet at multiple time points with a
person with lived experience of a mental illness living in
recovery in order to learn about that person’s life and

 experiences.45,52,63 Evaluations using the OMS-HC have
shown this model to be effective at improving attitudes and
behavioural intentions and sustaining those improvements over
time, and qualitative research suggests the personal and
cooperative nature of the social contact can provide a powerful
and positively transformative learning experience for both
providers and client educators.45,63
Conclusion
The primary focus of this article was to identify barriers to
access and quality care created by stigmatization processes at
the level of personal and interpersonal stigma and to identify
solutions that can be implemented within existing structures.
A key limitation of the evidence described in this article is
that many anti-stigma interventions are evaluated using
provider-based
outcomes—typically
attitudes
and
beha-
vioural intentions of health providers. There is a need for
more research that targets the impacts of stigma reduction
initiatives on patient experiences and specific care practices.
As well, many programs are implemented and evaluated as
‘‘one-off’’ interventions. Longitudinal research using mixed-
method designs that track the implementation of more sustained
stigma reduction efforts within healthcare organizations and
setting would be of benefit.
An organizational culture that promotes staff health and
well-being and is committed to combating stigma in patient
care is likely to have a positive impact on staff and patient
safety as well as the financial bottom line. Approaching the
problem of stigmatization from an organizational culture per-
spective and a quality of care perspective—and developing and
implementing relevant stigma reduction metrics and targets
into health and safety (eg, Canadian Standards Association66)
and accreditation standards—would likely be an effective way
to target the personal and interpersonal components of stigma
described above and would also begin to address the structural
aspects of stigma embedded in the health system.
