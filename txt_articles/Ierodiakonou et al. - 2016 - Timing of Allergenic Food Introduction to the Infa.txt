IMPORTANCE Timing of introduction of allergenic foods to the infant diet may influence the
risk of allergic or autoimmune disease, but the evidence for this has not been
comprehensively synthesized.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review and meta-analyze evidence that timing of allergenic food
introduction during infancy influences risk of allergic or autoimmune disease.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and LILACS databases were
searched between January 1946 and March 2016.
STUDY SELECTION Intervention trials and observational studies that evaluated timing of
allergenic food introduction during the first year of life and reported allergic or autoimmune
disease or allergic sensitization were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were extracted in duplicate and synthesized for
meta-analysis using generic inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel methods with a
random-effects model. GRADE was used to assess the certainty of evidence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Wheeze, eczema, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, allergic
sensitization, type 1 diabetes mellitus, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease,
autoimmune thyroid disease, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
RESULTS Of 16 289 original titles screened, data were extracted from 204 titles reporting 146
studies. There was moderate-certainty evidence from 5 trials (1915 participants) that early
egg introduction at 4 to 6 months was associated with reduced egg allergy (risk ratio [RR],
0.56; 95% CI, 0.36-0.87; I2 = 36%; P = .009). Absolute risk reduction for a population with
5.4% incidence of egg allergy was 24 cases (95% CI, 7-35 cases) per 1000 population. There
was moderate-certainty evidence from 2 trials (1550 participants) that early peanut
introduction at 4 to 11 months was associated with reduced peanut allergy (RR, 0.29; 95% CI,
0.11-0.74; I2 = 66%; P = .009). Absolute risk reduction for a population with 2.5% incidence
of peanut allergy was 18 cases (95% CI, 6-22 cases) per 1000 population. Certainty of
evidence was downgraded because of imprecision of effect estimates and indirectness of the
populations and interventions studied. Timing of egg or peanut introduction was not
associated with risk of allergy to other foods. There was low- to very low-certainty evidence
that early fish introduction was associated with reduced allergic sensitization and rhinitis.
There was high-certainty evidence that timing of gluten introduction was not associated
with celiac disease risk, and timing of allergenic food introduction was not associated with
other outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review, early egg or peanut introduction
to the infant diet was associated with lower risk of developing egg or peanut allergy.
These findings must be considered in the context of limitations in the primary studies.

I
ncreasing attention has focused on the role of timing of in-
troduction of allergenic food into the infant diet and risk
of allergic and autoimmune diseases. Infant feeding guide-
lines have moved away from advising parents to delay the in-
troduction of allergenic food, but most guidelines do not yet
advise early feeding of such foods.1-3 Several professional or-
ganizations have responded to recent research findings by is-
suing interim guidance advising early peanut introduction in
infants at high risk of peanut allergy, with some caveats.4,5
However, a randomized clinical trial of early introduction of
multiple allergenic foods did not show efficacy for prevent-
ingfoodallergy,6andatrialofearlyglutenintroductionshowed
no effect on risk of celiac disease.7 The implications for pre-
venting food allergy or other immune-mediated health con-
ditions in the general population are not clear.
ToinformUKinfantfeedingguidance,weundertookasys-
tematic review and meta-analysis for the UK Food Standards
Agency, evaluating whether timing of allergenic food intro-
duction to the infant diet influences risk of allergic or autoim-
mune disease. This is one of a series of systematic reviews of
dietary exposures in pregnancy or infancy and immune out-
comes,thefirstofwhichreviewedhydrolyzedinfantformula.8
The immunological mechanisms underlying the different al-
lergic and autoimmune diseases vary. For example, most food
allergyischaracterizedbyIgE-mediatedinflammation,whereas
type 1 diabetes mellitus is caused by T cell–mediated islet cell
destruction.9,10 However, these diseases share a common fea-
ture of impaired immune tolerance, and immune function in
infancy may be modified by dietary exposures. Therefore, a
comprehensive range of allergic and autoimmune outcomes
were included.
Methods and Literature Search
Methods are described in the Supplement. This systematic
review is reported according to PRISMA guidance.11 We
searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, LILACS, MEDLINE,
Web of Science, and http://apps.who.int/trialsearch from
January 1, 1946, to March 8, 2016. Intervention trials and
observational studies evaluating age at allergenic food intro-
duction (milk, egg, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts,
soya)12 during the first year and allergic or autoimmune dis-
ease at any age were included. Other systematic reviews
rated as high quality using published criteria13 were also
included per the study protocol to avoid duplicating existing
work. When other systematic reviews were included, original
studies that were not captured by the other reviews were also
summarized. Outcomes evaluated were wheeze, eczema,
allergic rhinitis, food allergy (a reproducible hypersensitivity
reaction to a food), allergic sensitization (the presence of spe-
cific IgE to an allergen), type 1 diabetes mellitus, celiac dis-
ease, inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis, psoriasis, and vitiligo.
Data were extracted in duplicate and risk of bias assessed
using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the National Insti-
tute for Clinical Excellence methodological checklists for in-
tervention and observational studies, respectively. Publica-
tion bias was assessed using funnel plots and the Egger test
when meta-analyses included at least 10 studies. Random-
effects meta-analyses used generic inverse variance and
Mantel-Haenszel methods for observational and interven-
tion studies, respectively. Heterogeneity was quantified using
the I2 statistic. Meta-analyses with I2>80% were not pooled.
For meta-analyses with more than 5 studies, we explored
heterogeneity in prespecified subgroup analyses of study de-
sign, risk of bias, risk of conflict of interest, and features of the
population, intervention, and outcome assessment. For
meta-analyses with 5 or fewer studies, we explored statisti-
cal heterogeneity descriptively and also conducted sensitiv-
ity analyses by study design and risk of bias for the key re-
view findings. The statistical program used for meta-analysis
was R, version 3.1.0 (R Project), and statistical significance was
set at 2-sided P<.05.
Post hoc trial sequential analysis was used to quantify sta-
tistical reliability of moderate- or high-certainty review find-
ings using a 2-sided P<.05 significance level, 80% power, and
control event rates from included studies to estimate optimal
heterogeneity-adjusted and unadjusted information sizes
needed to identify relative risk reductions of 10%, 20%, and
30%. Trial sequential analysis quantifies statistical reliability
of data in a cumulative meta-analysis in a similar way to an in-
terim analysis in a single randomized clinical trial. GRADE was
used to assess certainty of evidence, and the protocol was reg-
istered in PROSPERO.14 Ethical approval was not required by

tistical code are available from the corresponding author.
Results
Search results are summarized in eFigure 1 (existing system-
atic reviews) and eFigure 2 (original studies) in the Supple-
ment. A summary of the findings of the 2 included system-
atic reviews is shown in eTables 1 and 2 in the Supplement.
Title, abstract, and full-text screening of original studies
yielded 146 eligible studies (204 separate titles). Overall, 24
intervention trials (39 titles) evaluated allergic outcomes in
13 298 participants and 5 intervention trials (6 titles) evalu-
ated autoimmune diseases in 5623 participants. Sixty-nine
Key Points
Question Does the timing of allergenic food introduction to
infants affect their risk of developing allergic or autoimmune
disease?
Findings There was moderate-certainty evidence that early
introduction of egg (from 4-6 months) or peanut (from 4-11
months) was associated with reduced risk of egg or peanut
allergy, respectively. There was low- to very low-certainty
evidence that early fish introduction was associated with reduced
allergic sensitization and rhinitis and high-certainty evidence
that timing of gluten introduction was not associated with risk
of celiac disease.
Meaning Early introduction of egg or peanut to infants was
associated with a reduced risk of egg or peanut allergy.

observational studies (90 titles) reported allergic outcomes in
142 103 participants and 48 observational studies (69 titles)
evaluated autoimmune diseases in 63 576 participants. No
study reported psoriasis or vitiligo. For allergic outcomes,
these included 55 cohort studies (1 retrospective), 2 nested
case-control studies, and 12 case-control or cross-sectional
studies. For autoimmune diseases, there were 7 cohort stud-
ies, 4 nested case-control studies, and 37 case-control stud-
ies. Characteristics of included studies are summarized in
eTables 3 and 4 (allergic outcomes) and eTables 5 and 6 (au-
toimmune outcomes) in the Supplement. More detailed char-
acteristics of the intervention studies of egg or peanut intro-
duction that reported egg or peanut allergy are shown in
Table 1 and Table 2.
Risk of bias was low in 4 (17%) of 24 intervention trials and
29 (42%) of 69 observational studies for allergic outcomes
(eTables 7 and 8 in the Supplement), and in 1 (20%) of 5 inter-
vention trials and 10 (21%) of 48 observational studies for au-
toimmuneoutcomes(eTables9and10intheSupplement).The
main issues identified were attrition bias in intervention trials
and lack of adjustment for potential confounders in observa-
tional studies.
The key findings of the systematic review are summa-
rized in Table 3, with GRADE evidence assessment summa-
rized in Table 4 and specific analyses for all positive or high-
certainty findings shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3.
More detailed methods and a summary of all findings are in
eTable 11 in the Supplement. The full report with a detailed
description of all findings including meta-analyses and
detailed methods is available on the UK Food Standards
Agency website (http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research
/allergy-research/fs305005) together with an associated
statement by the UK Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in
Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (http://cot
.food.gov.uk/cotstatements).
Risk of Food Allergy and Allergic Sensitization
Fifteen intervention trials reported food allergy to any food
or to milk, egg, or peanut separately in 10 304 participants.
Seventeen trials reported allergic sensitization to any aller-
gen, aeroallergen, food allergen, egg, peanut, or milk in 7310
participants. A summary of findings is shown in eTable 11 in
the Supplement. Key findings for food allergy and allergic
sensitization to egg, peanut, or milk are summarized in
Figure 1, A and B.
Meta-analysis of 5 trials (1915 participants) showed evi-
dence that egg introduction at 4 to 6 months was associated
with lower risk of egg allergy compared with later egg intro-
duction(riskratio[RR],0.56;95%CI,0.36-0.87;P = .009;mod-
erate heterogeneity [I2 = 36%]).6,15-18 Absolute risk reduction
forapopulationwith5.4%incidenceofeggallergywas24cases
(95% CI, 7-35 cases) per 1000 population. Meta-analysis of 4
trials (1786 participants) showed no association between tim-
ing of egg introduction and egg sensitization.
Meta-analysis of 2 trials (1550 participants) showed evi-
dence that peanut introduction at age 4 to 11 months was
associated with lower risk of peanut allergy (RR, 0.29; 95%
CI, 0.11-0.74; P = .009; high heterogeneity [I2 = 66%]).4-6
Absolute risk reduction for a population with 2.5% incidence
of peanut allergy was 18 cases (95% CI, 6-22 cases) per 1000
population. One trial (640 participants) reported significantly
reduced allergic sensitization to peanut with early peanut
introduction, but numerical data were not reported; a second
trial (1168 participants) found no significant association
(Figure 1B).4,6
For several key findings, there was moderate to high sta-
tistical heterogeneity. For the egg introduction and egg
allergy analysis, heterogeneity was due to the abstract publi-
cation by Natsume and colleagues17—the authors declined to
share further information about their study. The study by
Perkin and colleagues,6 which used multiple allergenic food
introduction, had findings that were consistent with other
studies15,16,18 in which egg was the only allergenic food used.
For the egg introduction and egg sensitization analysis,
heterogeneity was due to the abstract publication by Bellach
and colleagues,16 which used specific IgE rather than
skin prick testing to determine egg sensitization. For the pea-
nut introduction and peanut allergy analysis, the high
heterogeneity was attributed to the high treatment adher-
ence in the study by Du Toit and colleagues4 compared with
more variable treatment adherence in the study by Perkin
and colleagues.6
In interventional studies, there was no association be-
tween timing of introduction of cow’
s milk19,20 (Figure 1) or
other allergenic food and food allergy or allergic sensitization
and no association between timing of introduction of one al-
lergenic food and risk of food allergy or allergic sensitization
to a different food (eTable 11 in the Supplement).
Abstract publications made a significant contribution to
the analysis of egg introduction and egg allergy. However, the
findings were similar in sensitivity analyses excluding ab-
stract publications for which authors were unable to share full
trialfindings(eFigure3AintheSupplement)orexcludingstud-
ies at high or unclear risk of bias (eFigure 3B in the Supple-
ment). In sensitivity analyses of allergic sensitization that ex-
cluded abstracts (eFigure 4A in the Supplement) or studies at
highorunclearriskofbias(eFigure4BintheSupplement),early
eggintroductionwasassociatedwithsignificantlyreducedrisk
of allergic sensitization to egg.
Eighteen observational studies reported food allergy in
40 194 participants, and 20 studies reported allergic sensiti-
zation in 23 466 participants. One prospective cohort study
(699 participants) found an association between early egg
introduction and decreased egg allergy (odds ratio [OR],
0.29; 95% CI, 0.15-0.56) and adjusted for possible reverse
causation.21 Three cohort studies (13 472 participants), which
could not be meta-analyzed because of statistical heteroge-
neity and heterogeneity of analysis methods (Figure 2A),
found that early fish introduction (before age 6-9 months)
was associated with reduced allergic sensitization to any
allergen or food allergens.22-24 There was no association
between timing of introduction of other allergenic foods and
risk of food allergy or allergic sensitization. Assessment for
publication bias in analyses of food allergy and allergic sensi-
tization was not possible because of the limited number of
studies in each meta-analysis.

Risk of Allergic Rhinitis
Thirteen intervention trials (6333 participants) and 12 obser-
vational studies (25 147 participants) reported allergic rhini-
tis. A summary of findings is shown in eTable 11 in the Supple-
ment. Four cohort studies (12 781 participants) (Figure 2B)
found fish introduction before age 6 to 12 months was asso-
ciated with reduced allergic rhinitis at age 4 years or younger
(OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.87; high heterogeneity [I2 = 59%])
or at age 5 to 14 years (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47-0.98).22,23,25,26
In a sensitivity analysis excluding studies at high or unclear
risk of bias (eFigure 5 in the Supplement), the association be-
tween early fish introduction and reduced allergic rhinitis at
age 4 years or younger was not statistically significant. It was
not possible to explain the heterogeneity in the fish introduc-
tion and allergic rhinitis analysis. In other intervention and ob-
servational studies, timing of allergenic food introduction was
notassociatedwithriskofallergicrhinitis.Assessmentforpub-
lication bias in analyses of allergic rhinitis was not possible be-
cause of the limited number of studies in each meta-analysis.
Risk of Wheeze
Sixteen intervention trials (8433 participants) and 30 obser-
vational studies (65 601 participants) reported wheeze. A sum-
maryoffindingsisshownineTable11intheSupplement.Three
cohort studies (11 155 participants) found that fish introduc-
tion before age 8 to 12 months was associated with reduced
recurrent wheeze at age 4 years or younger (OR, 0.72; 95% CI,
0.59-0.87;noheterogeneity[I2 = 0%]).23,25,27However,5other
studies(13 033participants)foundnoassociationbetweentim-
ing of fish introduction and wheeze.28-32 In other interven-
tion and observational studies, there was no association be-
tween timing of allergenic food introduction and risk of
wheeze. Assessment for publication bias in analyses of wheeze
was not possible because of the limited number of studies in
each meta-analysis.
Risk of Eczema
Seventeen intervention trials (6798 participants) and 37 ob-
servational studies (59 120 participants) reported eczema. A
summary of findings is shown in eTable 11 in the Supple-
ment.Formostanalysesofinterventiontrials,dataweresparse;
for several analyses of observational studies, statistical hetero-
geneity was high. Overall, there was no consistent associa-
tion between timing of allergenic food introduction and risk
of eczema from either intervention or observational studies.
Assessment for publication bias in analyses of eczema was not
possible because of the limited number of studies.
Risk of Autoimmune Diseases
Five intervention trials (5623 participants) and 48 observa-
tional studies (63 576 participants) reported autoimmune dis-
ease, and 2 other systematic reviews of observational data
were identified. A summary of findings is shown in eTable 11
in the Supplement. The systematic reviews found no consis-
tent evidence for an association between timing of gluten
introduction and celiac disease.33,34 Intervention trials also
found no association between timing of gluten introduction
and celiac disease (Figure 3) or type 1 diabetes mellitus or

a Data are shown for all positive findings and for other findings for which meta-analysis of a significant number of
studies and participants was possible. Number needed to treat is given only for outcomes where evidence of
association was found. Risk difference is the absolute risk reduction for different control risks.
bGRADE of evidence increased because of strong effect size. Control risks are estimated from included studies or
when relevant from other large, population-based studies for populations at different risks of the outcome.
Specifically, the risks of egg allergy refer to an unselected population of infants (normal risk), infants at high
hereditary risk of allergic disease (high risk), and infants with moderate to severe eczema (very high risk); risks of
peanut allergy refer to an unselected population of infants (normal risk) and infants with moderate to severe
eczema (high risk); risks of allergic rhinitis, allergic sensitization, eczema, and wheeze refer to an unselected
population of infants (normal risk) and infants at high risk of allergic disease due to having an affected
first-degree relative (high risk); risks of celiac disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus refer to an unselected
population of infants (normal risk) and infants at high risk of disease due to either having an affected first-degree
relative having a high-risk genotype (high risk).

a GRADE assessments are shown for all positive findings and for other findings for which meta-analysis of a
significant number of studies and participants was possible. Evaluation of publication bias was possible only for 1
outcome, timing of cow’
s milk introduction and type 2 diabetes mellitus; funnel plots were not asymmetrical and
Egger test was not significant (P = .26 for milk introduction age �0-2 mo; P = .59 for milk introduction age
�3-4 mo), suggesting no evidence of publication bias. For other analyses, there were insufficient studies to
undertake formal testing of publication bias.
bThe number of studies included is not always the same as the number of studies included in the meta-analysis
since some studies did not report data in a form that could be included in meta-analyses. All data were
considered when making GRADE assessments.

milk introduction and type 1 diabetes mellitus.7,35-38 In sensi-
tivity analyses excluding studies at high or unclear risk of
bias (eFigure 6A in the Supplement) or only high risk of bias
(eFigure 6B in the Supplement), there was no association
between timing of gluten introduction and celiac disease. For
the gluten introduction and celiac disease analysis, heteroge-
neity was due to the study by Sellitto and colleagues37—in
this study, the control group had not yet ingested gluten at
the time of outcome assessment so celiac disease or serology
could not manifest.
Observational studies found no association between tim-
ing of gluten introduction and risk of celiac disease or inflam-
matory bowel disease; milk introduction and celiac disease or
juvenile idiopathic arthritis; or timing of allergenic food

no evidence of publication bias in analyses of milk introduc-

GRADE Evaluation of Certainty of Findings
Key findings were affected by the study of select popula-

sensitization to the intervention food, or both. There
was also significant variation between the populations stud-

(3-4 days) introduction of an allergenic food to early sus-
tained introduction of single or multiple allergenic foods to
trials of delayed allergenic food introduction and multifac-
eted studies that also included other dietary components,
often together with environmental control measures such
as tobacco smoke and house dust mite avoidance. GRADE of
evidence was therefore reduced in several analyses because
of indirectness of the population or intervention (Table 4).
GRADE of evidence for the egg and peanut findings was also
reduced because of imprecise effect estimates but was
increased for peanut because of the strong effect size seen
in the trial of Du Toit and colleagues.4
Trial Sequential Analysis of Moderate- or High-Certainty
Findings
Peanut introduction and peanut allergy were not evaluated
using trial sequential analysis because of insufficient data in
the meta-analysis to estimate a sufficient number of points for
the monitoring boundaries. There were also insufficient data
to perform trial sequential analysis for 10% or 20% relative risk
reduction for other findings. Whether early egg introduction
wasassociatedwitha30%reductioninriskofeggallergyusing
trial sequential analysis was assessed. The heterogeneity-
adjusted and unadjusted optimal information sizes for detec-
tion of a 30% relative risk reduction for egg allergy were 8643
and 5239 study participants, respectively. Trial sequential
analysis for this outcome is shown in eFigures 7A and 7B in the
Supplement. Although the conventional line of statistical sig-
nificance was crossed (z = 1.96) in both analyses, the optimal
information size was not reached in either case. The cumula-
tive z score did not cross the monitoring boundary, although
it is close in unadjusted trial sequential analysis. It cannot be
confidently concluded that early egg introduction reduces egg
allergy by at least 30%; further trials are required to quantify
the treatment effect.
Trial sequential analysis was also used to evaluate
whether early gluten introduction increases celiac disease
risk by 30%. The heterogeneity-adjusted and unadjusted
optimal information sizes for detection of a 30% increase in
relative risk of celiac disease were 3599 and 9497 study par-
ticipants, respectively. Trial sequential analysis for this out-
come is shown in eFigures 7C and 7D in the Supplement. The
conventional line of statistical significance was not crossed
and the optimal information size was not reached. The
cumulative z score was close to the line of futility in unad-
justed trial sequential analysis. It cannot be confidently con-
cluded that further studies of timing of gluten introduction
and risk of celiac disease are futile.
Discussion
Thissystematicreviewfoundevidencethattimingofintroduc-
tion of certain allergenic foods to the infant diet was associ-
atedwithriskofallergicdiseasebutnotriskofautoimmunedis-
ease.Therewasmoderate-certaintyevidencethatintroduction
ofeggtotheinfantdietatage4to6monthswasassociatedwith
reduced egg allergy and introduction of peanut at age 4 to 11
months was associated with reduced peanut allergy compared
with later introduction of these foods. There was low-
certainty evidence that fish introduction before age 6 to 12
months was associated with reduced allergic rhinitis and very
low-certainty evidence that fish introduction before age 6 to 9
months was associated with reduced allergic sensitization.
The evidence base for a relationship between early aller-
genic food introduction and food allergy to the same food
was limited to a relatively small number of studies and
events and was only statistically significant for egg and pea-
nut. Heterogeneity-adjusted trial sequential analysis of early
egg introduction for egg allergy suggests that further trials
are warranted to confirm the findings and quantify the mag-
nitude of the treatment effect. Heterogeneity for egg intro-
duction was attributable to 1 small study presented in
abstract form only.13 Trial sequential analysis without adjust-
ment for heterogeneity showed stronger evidence that early
egg introduction reduced risk of egg allergy by 30% or more
but without crossing the trial sequential monitoring bound-
ary. Trial sequential analysis of early peanut introduction for
peanut allergy was not possible due to the small number of
studies and events in this analysis. The inability to undertake
trial sequential analysis for this outcome emphasizes the
value of further intervention studies of peanut introduction
and peanut allergy.39
These findings are consistent with a large body of experi-
mental data in various animal models in which early enteral
antigen exposure is established as effective for preventing al-
lergic sensitization to the same antigen.40 This phenomenon
of oral tolerance has not been directly shown to occur in hu-
mans until recently.4,41 Oral tolerance in humans appears to
be antigen specific, with no data showing early introduction
of one allergenic food influences the development of allergy
to a different allergenic food.
In contrast to egg and peanut allergy, this review found
that oral tolerance was not relevant to celiac disease, suggest-
ing that the findings may not be generalizable beyond food
allergy mediated by IgE antibodies. Trial sequential analysis
of gluten introduction and celiac disease risk found that fur-
ther trials would not be futile; however, available data show
no evidence of an association. Ongoing work is evaluating a
potential role for oral tolerance in other autoimmune dis-
eases; for example, the induction of immune tolerance to
insulin for preventing type 1 diabetes mellitus.42 There was
also no consistent evidence that early cow’
s milk introduc-
tion influences risk of type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is con-
sistent with recent literature; for example, a trial of exten-
sively hydrolyzed vs intact infant formula showed no effect
on type 1 diabetes mellitus risk.43
There was lower-certainty evidence that early fish intro-
duction was associated with reduced allergic sensitization or
rhinitis. Sensitivity analysis of studies at low risk of bias found
that the association with allergic rhinitis at age 4 years or
younger was not statistically significant. One plausible bio-
logical mechanism is that early exposure to the anti-
inflammatory effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
present in fish might influence development or expression of
allergic sensitization and associated inflammatory disease.44

These data conflict with previous recommendations to de-
lay introduction of allergenic foods to the infant diet and sug-
gest that current guidelines that do not advise early introduc-
tion of allergenic foods may need to be revised.1-3 They are,
however, consistent with 1 recent intervention trial and a con-
sensus statement regarding introduction of peanut to the in-
fantdiet,4,5andanydifferencesinconclusionsfromothertrials
can be explained by the increased statistical power derived
from meta-analysis.
Despite the comprehensive approach used in this review,
it was not possible to exclude clinically important effects in
mostanalysesbecausetherewerefewstudies.Certaintyofevi-
dence was downgraded because of imprecision and indirect-
ness and variation in interventions used and populations stud-
ied. However, there was not a clear difference in outcome
among studies of different populations in our analyses; for ex-
ample, in meta-analysis of egg introduction and egg allergy, 3
studies undertaken in normal-risk, high-risk, and very high-
risk populations had similar findings. Risk-of-bias assess-
ment used different instruments for intervention and obser-
vational studies, which may not be directly comparable.
These systematic review findings should not automati-
cally lead to new recommendations to feed egg and peanut to
all infants. The imprecise effect estimates, issues regarding in-
directness, and inconclusive trial sequential analysis find-
ings all need to be considered, together with a careful assess-
ment of the safety and acceptability of early egg and peanut
introduction in different populations.
Conclusions
In this systematic review, early introduction of egg or peanut
to the infant diet was associated with lower risk of develop-
ing egg or peanut allergy. These findings must be considered
in the context of limitations in the primary studies.
