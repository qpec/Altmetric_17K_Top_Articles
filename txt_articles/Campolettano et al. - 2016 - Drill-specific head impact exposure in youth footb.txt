t is estimated that between 1.6 and 3.8 million sports-
related concussions occur in the United States each 
year.6,16 Sports-related concussions have been the sub-
ject of much public attention due to research suggesting 
potential long-term effects resulting from these brain in-
juries.25 Football has been linked to the highest incidence 
of brain injury among team sports, spurring a great deal 
of biomechanics research related to concussions and foot-
ball.3–6,11,16,19,20,22,23 The prevailing thought for concussion 
mitigation in football today is to limit exposure to head 
impacts through proper teaching and rule modification.10
Head impact biomechanics research for football has 
largely relied on outfitting athletes with helmet instru-
mentation during play to collect head impact data. This 
research has resulted in data on millions of head impacts, 
which have been used to quantify tolerance to concussion 
and characterize head impact exposure in football.15 Most 
research on head impact exposure in football has focused 
on high school, collegiate, and professional populations, 
despite the fact that 70% of all football players in the Unit-
ed States are youth players (6–14 years old).13 Recently, 
researchers have begun to use instrumentation such as 
helmet-mounted accelerometer arrays to collect data on 
youth football players to quantify head impact exposure 
and assess concussion tolerance.7,13,14,27 Daniel et al. provid-
ed 7 players (7–8 years old) with helmets equipped with 
instrumentation to measure head impacts. With the use of 
these helmets, Daniel et. al demonstrated that more high-
magnitude impacts occurred in practice than in games.13 
The findings from that study were part of the process that 
ultimately led to rule changes in the Pop Warner youth 
sports organization that were aimed at mitigating head

obJeCtive Although 70% of football players in the United States are youth players (6–14 years old), most research on 
head impacts in football has focused on high school, collegiate, or professional populations. The objective of this study 
was to identify the specific activities associated with high-magnitude (acceleration > 40g) head impacts in youth football 
practices.
MethoDs A total of 34 players (mean age 9.9 ± 0.6 years) on 2 youth teams were equipped with helmet-mounted 
accelerometer arrays that recorded head accelerations associated with impacts in practices and games. Videos of prac-
tices and games were used to verify all head impacts and identify specific drills associated with each head impact.
resUlts A total of 6813 impacts were recorded, of which 408 had accelerations exceeding 40g (6.0%). For each type 
of practice drill, impact rates were computed that accounted for the length of time that teams spent on each drill. The 
tackling drill King of the Circle had the highest impact rate (95% CI 25.6–68.3 impacts/hr). Impact rates for tackling drills 
(those conducted without a blocker [95% CI 14.7–21.9 impacts/hr] and those with a blocker [95% CI 10.5–23.1 impacts/
hr]) did not differ from game impact rates (95% CI 14.2–21.6 impacts/hr). Tackling drills were observed to have a greater 
proportion (between 40% and 50%) of impacts exceeding 60g than games (25%). The teams in this study participated 
in tackling or blocking drills for only 22% of their overall practice times, but these drills were responsible for 86% of all 
practice impacts exceeding 40g. 
ConClUsions In youth football, high-magnitude impacts occur more often in practices than games, and some prac-
tice drills are associated with higher impact rates and accelerations than others. To mitigate high-magnitude head impact 
exposure in youth football, practices should be modified to decrease the time spent in drills with high impact rates, poten-
tially eliminating a drill such as King of the Circle altogether.

impact exposure in youth football.21 The following year, 
Cobb et al. followed 3 youth football teams with players 
9–12 years of age and found that teams adhering to the 
policy changes experienced a 40% reduction in overall 
impacts relative to those that did not.7 Due to differences 
in age, head impact magnitude and frequency were found 
to be greater in the study by Cobb et al. than in the study 
by Daniel et al., although both magnitude and frequency 
were still less than that found in older populations.12,26
While these studies provided valuable insight regarding 
head impact exposure in youth football players, they inves-
tigated practices and games as a whole, with little analy-
sis quantifying the causation of high-magnitude impacts, 
which are associated with higher risks of head injury. The 
objective of this study was to analyze youth football prac-
tices and determine which drills were associated with the 
highest magnitude impacts. Secondarily, this study aimed 
to determine how representative practice drills were of 
games by comparing impact rates between practices and 
games. This analysis represents a first step toward develop-
ing pointed efforts to improve player safety in youth foot-
ball. Conducted on a larger scale, these methods and the re-
sulting data could be used to inform further policy changes 
to mitigate head impact exposure in youth football.
Methods
Two youth football teams composed of 9- to 11-year-
old players were included in this study, which was ap-
proved by the Virginia Tech Institutional Review Board. 
Guardians provided written consent, and the youth play-
ers verbally assented to participation. A total of 34 players 
were recruited and chose to participate. Each received a 
helmet instrumented with accelerometer arrays (Head Im-
pact Telemetry [HIT] System, Simbex). Study participants 
had a mean age of 9.9 ± 0.6 years and a mean body mass 
of 37.4 ± 9.6 kg. Between the 2 teams, data collection com-
prised a total of 65 sessions, of which 55 were practices 
and 10 were games.
The HIT System consists of a 6-accelerometer array 
that is mounted inside of Riddell Revolution or Speed hel-
mets. A 10g resultant acceleration threshold was used to 
distinguish between actual impacts and accelerations lev-
els that could be attained by simply jumping or running 
quickly. 
The accelerometers are spring mounted so that contact 
with the head is maintained for the duration of impact. 
This ensures measurement of head acceleration, rather 
than helmet acceleration.17 Players wore the instrumented 
helmets at each practice and game throughout the sea-
son. Helmet instrumentation collected data continuously, 
but when an individual data channel exceeded the 14.4g 
threshold, data acquisition was automatically triggered, 
capturing 40 msec of data, including 8 msec of preimpact 
data. Impact data were then wirelessly transmitted from 
the helmets to a sideline computer, in which linear and 
rotational accelerations were computed.8,23
Games and practices were filmed to facilitate video 
verification of head impacts. For every impact greater than 
or equal to 40g in practice, video was also used to identify 
the specific drill/activity associated with impact. Each of 
these impacts was assigned to one of 9 practice drill clas-
sifications (Table 1). Game impacts exceeding 40g were 
also verified to allow for comparison of high-magnitude 
head impact rates between practices and games.
Investigating practices at the drill level required deter-
mination of numbers of impacts and time spent for each 
drill type. Practice videos and activity logs kept for each 
day of practice were used to determine the total time 
spent participating in each drill type. Both the number of 
impacts and time spent in a drill varied greatly over the 
course of the season, necessitating the use of a normalized 
impact rate for comparisons to be made. Impact rates for 
each drill were computed on a per-hour basis to character-
ize each drill type. Byar’s method, which represents an ex-
act approximation to the Poisson distribution and retains 
high levels of accuracy for both small and large counts, 
was used to compute 95% confidence intervals for the im-
pact rates in this study.2 Boxplots were developed for each 
drill type for both linear and rotational resultant accelera-
tion. The first and third quartiles enclose the box, with any 
data points beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range from 
the first or third quartile defined as outliers.18 The corre-
sponding impact rates and boxplots were also calculated 
for games to provide a means of comparison.
results
For the season, a total of 6813 impacts were recorded 
and verified from instrumented players, of which 408 had 
accelerations exceeding 40g. These impacts were video 
verified, with 314 (77%) occurring in practice and the re-
maining 94 (23%) in games. Of 6813 overall season im-
pacts, 408 (6.0%) total impacts exceeded 40g, 118 (1.7%) 
exceeded 60g, and 59 (0.9%) exceeded 70g. Although 
assessment of player injury was deferred to usual league 
protocol in instances of suspected concussion, no players 
in the study sustained a clinically diagnosed concussion.
The greatest number of impacts exceeding 40g oc-
curred in tackling drills, even though they were practiced 
only half as often as organized offensive or defensive drills 
(Table 2). A 40g acceleration value was selected as the 
table 1. Practice drills associated with > 40g impacts

threshold for high-magnitude impacts which included the 
top 6% of impacts that players in this study experienced, 
while the 60g threshold included the top 2% of impacts 
and is within the range of previously measured concussive 
impacts in this population (concussions at the youth level 
have been reported at 58g and 64g).7 Drills involving tack-
ling resulted in a higher rate of impacts than those that did 
not (Fig. 1). Increasing severity thresholds resulted in lower 
rates of impact across all drills. Overall, impact rates for 
games (95% CI 14.2–21.6 impacts/hr) did not vary greatly 
from those for tackling practice drills (those conducted 
without a blocker [95% CI 14.7–21.9 impacts/hr] and those 
with a blocker [95% CI 10.5–23.1 impacts/hr]), with the 
exception of King of the Circle, which had the highest im-
pact rate (95% CI 25.6–68.3 impacts/hr). This trend was 
consistent for all acceleration severity thresholds.
Distributions of both linear and rotational acceleration 
magnitudes varied between drill types and games (Fig. 2). 
Tackling drills were associated with head impacts of great-
er severity than nontackling drills. Furthermore, the pro-
portion of impacts greater than 60g was higher in tackling 
drills (between 40% and 50%) than in games (25%). Simi-
lar trends were observed for rotational acceleration, with 
tackling drills being associated with a greater proportion 
of high-magnitude accelerations than nontackling drills or 
games.
Discussion

head impacts.7,13,14,27 The proportion of high-magnitude 
head impacts (those exceeding 40g) in youth practices 
(77%) was similar to the 79% found by Daniel et al.13 Fur-
thermore, the proportion of high-magnitude impacts for 
severity thresholds of 40g and 60g was consistent with 
that observed by Cobb et al.7 This relationship between 
high-magnitude impacts in practices and games contrasts 
with that observed in high school and collegiate football, 
where high-magnitude impacts were more often observed 
in games than in practices.4,9,10,24 Efforts aimed at reducing 
high-magnitude impacts in practices necessitate an evalu-
ation of practice drill structure.
Impact rate differed markedly between practice drills 
with and without tackling for all acceleration severity lev-
els. Impacts without tackling resulted in fewer than 10 im-
pacts above 40g per practice-hour, while drills involving 
tackling exceeded this by at least a factor of 2. King of the 
Circle produced high-magnitude impacts more frequently 
than any other activity because of the speed at which it 
is performed (Fig. 1). A ball carrier in the middle of a 
circle rushes at 3 different defenders on the perimeter of 
the circle. When the ball carrier rushes at each defender 
on the perimeter, he must be tackled. The drill continues 
until each player has had the opportunity to be the ball 
carrier. Notably, this drill was carried out for the short-
est amount of time of all drills assessed. Furthermore, no 
impact from King of the Circle exceeded 70g (Table 2). 
Tackling drills, with or without blockers, were associated 
with the highest proportion of impacts over 70g. The pres-
ence of a blocker did not have an effect on the impact rate. 
This suggests that the end goal of tackling has more bear-
ing on the high-magnitude impact rate than does the drill 
environment itself. Furthermore, the practice drill aimed 
at teaching blocking (Blocking) was associated with a 
lower impact rate for all severity thresholds compared 
with tackling drills that involve players engaging with a 
blocker (Tackling–Blocker). In comparing the tackling 
drills, which only differed in whether a blocker was pres-
ent to engage with the tackling defender (Blocker or No 
Blocker), we observed that a greater proportion of higher-
magnitude impacts was associated with the drill when a 
blocker was not present (Fig. 2). Reducing the time spent 
Fig. 2. Tackling drills were found to have the largest proportion of impacts over 70g. Tackling drills were associated with a greater 
acceleration severity than games. Tackling drills comprised Tackling–Blocker, Tackling–No Blocker, King of the Circle, and Of-
fense vs Defense. All other drills were considered skill drills. Only impacts exceeding 40g were included. The red line in each box 
denotes the median; boxes, the interquartile range; and plus signs, the outliers. The whiskers represent the threshold for defining a 
point as being within the data set or being an outlier. They are defined to be 1.5 times the interquartile range from the first or third 
quartile. If an outlier did not exist for a particular drill, then they represent the minimum and maximum in that scenario. Figure is

in drills of this nature can limit the frequency at which 
youth players are exposed to high-severity head impacts.
Both teams in the study spent about 3-fold as much time 
conducting the Offense or Defense drill compared with 
the next most popular drill, Offense vs Defense (Table 2). 
The Offense or Defense drill resulted in a very low rate of 
impact and closely mimicked game play because it effec-
tively served as an opportunity for the players to practice 
game plans and positioning. Offense vs Defense also ex-
hibited fidelity to game situations, and the higher impact 
rate observed stems from the smaller number of players 
involved. With more open space in the field of play, play-
ers were able to achieve greater running speeds and thus 
produce higher-magnitude head impacts. The Offense or 
Defense drill allowed the teams to have 11 players on one 
side of the ball and work more on execution of plays. The 
Offense vs Defense drill opposed an offense and a defense 
with neither side having 11 players, with the goal being to 
simulate the physical side of the game. It should be noted 
that the small size of the teams (neither team exceeded 
20 total players) prevented the teams from being able to 
conduct intrasquad scrimmages (11 players on each side 
of the ball), which would best represent a game situation.
Drills involving tackling were associated with impact 
rates similar to those for games, excluding King of the 
Circle (Fig. 1). However, tackling drills were associated 
with a greater proportion (between 40% and 50%) of im-
pacts exceeding 60g than games (25%). Even though most 
practice drills did not result in impact rates higher than 
those in games, practices led to a greater number of high-
magnitude head impacts because there were more practic-
es than games. The greater proportion of high-magnitude 
game impacts between 40g and 60g suggests that specific 
practice drills, primarily those that involve tackling, ex-
pose youth football players to more severe impacts than 
would be experienced in game play (Fig. 2).
Each practice session lasted 90 minutes, approximately 
40 minutes of which were spent in non–football drill ac-
tivities, such as running, stretching, instruction, and water 
breaks. On the season, 88% of the remaining 50 minutes 
was spent in one of the drills specified in Table 1, with the 
remaining 12% in drills that did not result in high-magni-
tude impacts. On average, this corresponded to 17 minutes 
spent in Offense or Defense, 9 minutes in tackling drills, 
6 minutes in Offense vs Defense, 5 minutes in blocking 
drills, and the remaining 13 minutes in all other drills. The 
teams in this study participated in tackling or blocking 
drills for only 22% of their overall practice times, but these 
drills were responsible for 86% of all practice impacts ex-
ceeding 40g. If these 2 teams reduced the time spent in 
tackling or blocking drills by 5 minutes each practice, this 
would result in a 19% decrease in practice impacts over 
40g. Similarly, a 10-minute reduction would result in a 
38% decrease in such impacts (Fig. 3). A 50% reduction 
in high-magnitude impacts would be observed in tackling 
and blocking drills with this reduction. To further reduce 
high-magnitude head impacts, the King of the Circle drill 
could be eliminated from youth practices because the very 
high impact rate was not representative of games.
Certain limitations of this study should be noted. The 
HIT System is associated with error up to 15.7% for in-
dividual acceleration measurements, although the mean 
overall error for many measurements is only 1%.1 Individ-
ual acceleration measurements were used to determine im-
pacts that exceeded the 40g study threshold. Beyond that, 
the resulting analysis characterized distributions of data for 
which the effect of this error would be minimized.7 Other 
factors limit the applicability of these results to other situa-
tions. Just as the 2 teams studied here exhibited differences 
in head impact exposure and practice style, profiles of head 
impact exposure and practice structure likely will vary 
between teams and individuals.9–12 Head impact exposure 
and practice structure will vary by age group,3–5,7,11–14,27 and 
the game-to-practice ratio will vary by team and league.
Conclusions
Head impact kinematic data for 2 youth football teams 
of players 9–11 years old were collected to assess the ef-
fect of specific practice drills on impact exposure and 
their relation to game situations. For all impacts exceed-
ing 40g, rates of impact for the most severe drills (those 
with the highest-magnitude impacts) do not differ from 
Fig. 3. In each 90-minute practice session, teams spent an average of 50 minutes practicing drills. A 10-minute reduction split 
between Tackling, Blocking, and Offense vs Defense drills would result in a 38% decrease in high-magnitude head impacts over 
the course of the season. The pie charts represent the proportion of the 50 minutes on average of practice time that were spent in 
each drill. Figure is available in color online only.

those attained in games. At greater thresholds, up to 80g, 
tackling drills resulted in greater impact rates than games. 
These data suggest that a substantial reduction in high-
magnitude head impacts in youth football could be at-
tained through limiting the amount of contact in practice. 
Even though much practice time was spent in noncontact 
scenarios and several high-magnitude impacts recorded in 
this study occurred in noncontact situations, contact drills 
were associated with the majority of impacts over 40g. 
Coaches and league organizers can use these data to make 
informed decisions on practice structure that will help to 
reduce exposure to high-magnitude impacts. Further re-
search into practice drill impact exposure at all levels of 
football is necessary to increase player safety and to char-
acterize head impact exposure on a larger scale.
