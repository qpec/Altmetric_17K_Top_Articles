Purpose
The purpose of this study was to examine outcomes associated with hormonal maintenance therapy
(HMT) compared with routine observation (OBS) after primary cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based
chemotherapy in women with stage II to IV low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum.
Patients and Methods
Eligibility criteria for patients from our database were: treatment with primary surgery followed by platinum-
based chemotherapy, stage II to IV disease, at least 2 years of follow-up for patients who had not ex-
perienced recurrence, and adequate clinical information. The two groups were compared for progression-
free survival (PFS) and overall survival, and a multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed. Subset
analyses for patients who were disease free or had persistent disease were also performed.
Results
Between 1981 and 2013, 203 eligible patients—133 who underwent OBS and 70 who received
HMT—were seen at our institution. Median PFS for patients who underwent OBS was 26.4 months,
compared with 64.9 months for those who received HMT (P , .001). No statistically significant
difference in overall survival was observed between the two groups (102.7 v 115.7 months, re-
spectively). For subgroups of women who were disease free or had persistent disease, median PFS
was superior for those who received HMT (81.1 v 30.0 months; P , .001 and 38.1 v 15.2 months;
P , .001, respectively). Women who received HMT had a significantly lower risk of disease pro-
gression compared with those who underwent OBS (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.64; P , .001).
Conclusion
Women with stage II to IV low-grade serous carcinoma who received HMT after primary treatment
had significantly longer PFS compared with women who underwent OBS. These findings warrant
further investigation using a prospective trial design.

INTRODUCTION
Low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) of the ovary or
peritoneum is a rare histologic subtype that seems to
originate de novo or after diagnosis of a serous
tumor of low malignant potential (LMP). Several
publications from our group have highlighted the
relative resistance of this subtype to conven-
tional chemotherapy.1-5 A recent report from the
Arbeitsgemeinschaft
Gynaekologische
Onkologie
confirmed the observation that LGSC is not as re-
sponsive to chemotherapy as high-grade serous
carcinoma (HGSC).6 These findings have accelera-
ted the search for alternative effective therapies,
including hormonal therapy and targeted agents.7-9
For several years, similarities between lu-
minal
breast
cancer
and
LGSC
have
been
recognized. A high proportion of LGSCs have
estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor
(PR) expression, and hormonal therapy seems to
provide clinical benefit in . 70% of relapses.7,10,11
In addition, in both tumor types, women # 35
years of age have worse outcomes compared with
older women.5
On the basis of our clinical experience, LGSC
does not seem to be completely resistant to
platinum-based chemotherapy. Furthermore, in
the absence of prospective data indicating oth-
erwise, we continue to recommend platinum plus
taxane chemotherapy to women with newly di-
agnosed stage II to IV LGSC after primary
cytoreductive surgery. Others have begun to
abandon postoperative chemotherapy in favor of
hormonal therapy despite lack of data from
prospective clinical trials. Since the early 1980s,

 several patients seen at our institution have received hormonal
therapy after completion of primary platinum-based chemo-
therapy. The purpose of this study is to examine outcomes as-
sociated with hormonal maintenance therapy (HMT) compared
with routine observation (OBS) after primary cytoreductive sur-
gery and platinum-based chemotherapy in women with stage II to
IV LGSC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Our institutional review board approved the Low-Grade Serous Tumor
Database, a longitudinal database established in 2007. Data are collected both
retrospectively and prospectively. A waiver of informed consent was granted
for patients not seen at our institution for $ 1 year. All others provided
written informed consent. Eligibility criteria for this study were: treatment
with primary cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum-based chemo-
therapy, pathologically confirmed stage II to IV LGSC of the ovary or
peritoneum, OBS or HMTwithin 3 months after completion of postoperative
chemotherapy, $ 2 years of follow-up for patients who had not experienced
recurrence, and adequate clinical information. The choice of OBS versus
HMTwas determined by attending physician discretion and patient consent.
We identified 544 potentially eligible patients. We excluded 341
because of: incomplete clinical information (no confirmation of pathologic
diagnosis of LGSC and/or lack of clinical information regarding date of
disease progression; n = 81), disease progression during primary che-
motherapy or change in chemotherapy (n = 76), neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy (n = 51), treatment in a clinical trial (n = 26), non–platinum-based
or no chemotherapy (n = 23), wrong histology or stage (n = 39), hormonal
therapy started . 3 months after completion of primary chemotherapy (n
= 16), insufficient follow-up time (n = 10), or miscellaneous reasons (eg,
synchronous primary cancer, radiotherapy; n = 19). Therefore, 203 pa-
tients constituted the study cohort.
Pathology slides were reviewed by MD Anderson gynecologic pa-
thologists and documented as LGSC of the ovary or peritoneum. Criteria
for diagnosis of LGSC have been previously reported.4,12 Information on
ER and PR expression by immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue
was captured whenever available from pathology documents.
Database elements included: demographics, primary surgery, In-
ternational Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, perioperative
studies, systemic therapies, disease status at completion of primary treat-
ment, OBS versus HMT after primary chemotherapy, date of initial disease
progression, disease status at last contact, and date of last contact or death.
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version
21; Armonk, NY). Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from date
of primary surgery to date of disease progression or death, whichever
occurred first. Disease progression was determined by serial imaging
examinations and/or doubling of nadir serum cancer antigen 125. Overall
survival (OS) was calculated from date of primary surgery to date of last
contact or death resulting from any cause. Cumulative distributions of OS
and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.13 The log-rank
test was used to compare differences between survival curves. Cox pro-
portional hazards regression was used to model the association between
key variables and PFS and OS. The proportional hazards assumption was
checked for all models. Variables with P values , .25 on univariable
analysis were included in the multivariable models. All P values were two
sided. P values , .05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Between 1981 and 2013, 203 patients met eligibility criteria. After
primary cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy,
133 patients underwent OBS, and 70 received HMT. Demographic
and clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. Most patients were
white, had ovarian LGSC, and had stage III disease. No significant
differences between groups were found for most categories. A
significantly higher proportion of women in the HMT group had
LGSC after original diagnosis of serous LMP tumor (17.1% v 6%)
and persistent tumor at completion of primary chemotherapy
(60.0% v 8.3%).
Of the 70 patients who received HMT, 38 (54.3%) received
letrozole, two (2.9%) anastrozole, 20 (28.6%) tamoxifen, five
(7.1%) leuprolide acetate, two each leuprolide acetate with either
letrozole (2.9%) or tamoxifen (2.9%), and one (1.4%) depot
medroxyprogesterone acetate. Nine women—five who received
letrozole and four who received tamoxifen—required a change in
therapy because of adverse effects. Median duration of HMT was
33.3 months (range, 1 to 223.2 months).
Median follow-up time for the entire group was 70.8 months,
with a median of 80.3 months for patients undergoing OBS and
54.9 months for those receiving HMT. Of the 160 patients who had
experienced recurrence at the time of analysis, imaging studies
before the date of disease progression were available in 112 (70%).
Median interval between these two time points was 5.5 months for
the OBS group and 5.9 months for the HMT group (P = .85).
Median PFS for the entire group was 32.6 months (95% CI,
28.4 to 36.9). Median PFS for the OBS group was 26.4 months
(95% CI, 21.8 to 31.0), compared with 64.9 months (95% CI, 43.5
to 86.3) for the HMT group (P , .001; Fig 1A). Median OS for the
entire group was 104.7 months (95% CI, 75.1 to 134.3). No
statistically significant difference in OS was observed between the
OBS and HMT groups (102.7 v 115.7 months; P = .42; Fig 1B).
Within the OBS group, there was no significant difference in
median OS between women who eventually received hormonal
therapy for progression or recurrence and those who never re-
ceived hormonal therapy (106.8 v 102.7 months; P = .37).
In women who were clinically disease free at the completion of
platinum-based chemotherapy, median PFS was 30.0 months
(95% CI, 24.9 to 35.1) for the OBS group and 81.1 months (95%
CI, 54.9 to 107.2) for the HMT group (Fig 2A). In women with
persistent disease at completion of chemotherapy, median PFS was
15.2 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 22.9) for the OBS group and
38.1 months (95% CI, 17.8 to 58.4) for the HMT group (Fig 2B). A
stratified log-rank test comparing HMT and OBS groups adjusted
for disease status resulted in P , .001.
In women who were clinically disease free at the end of
primary chemotherapy, median OS was 191.3 months (95% CI,
93.5 to 289.0) for the HMT group and 106.8 months (95% CI, 70.2
to 143.4) for the OBS group (Fig 3A). In women who had persistent
disease, median OS was 83.3 months (95% CI, 48.2 to 118.4) for
the HMT group and 44.4 months (95% CI, 13.9 to 74.8) for the
OBS group (Fig 3B). A stratified log-rank test adjusted for disease
status resulted in P = .014.
Information on ER and/or PR expression was available in 76
and 69 patients, respectively (Table 1). ER and PR expression was
present in 96% and 58% of patients, respectively. When analyzed
by ER or PR expression status, patients receiving HMT had better
outcomes. Among ER-positive patients, those receiving HMT had
longer median PFS than those undergoing OBS (73.3 months; 95%
CI, 61.5 to 85.2 v 29.9 months; 95% CI, 22.6 to 37.1; P = .001).

 patients undergoing OBS, but this did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (191.3 months; 95% CI, 107.4 to 275.1 v 127.0 months;
95% CI, 77.2 to 176.8, respectively; P = .056). For PR-positive
patients, median PFS for those receiving HMTwas longer than that
for patients undergoing OBS (73.3 months; 95% CI, 59.0 to 87.7 v
22.6 months; 95% CI, 9.0 to 36.1, respectively; P = .001). For
PR-negative patients, those receiving HMT had better PFS than
those undergoing OBS (69.1 months; 95% CI, 5.1 to 133.1 v
29.9 months; 95% CI, 25.5 to 34.2, respectively; P = .04). There
were no differences in median OS for PR-positive patients. When
ER-positive/PR-positive patients were compared with ER-positive/
PR-negative patients, there were no significant differences in
median PFS or OS.
Tables 2 and 3 list the univariable and multivariable Cox
proportional hazards regression results for PFS and OS, re-
spectively. Variables with P , .25 on univariable analysis for PFS
included year of diagnosis, age, group, stage, and site. After
adjusting for these in a multivariable setting, age, group, stage,
and site remained significantly associated with disease progres-
sion. Compared with women age # 35 years of age, older women
had a significantly lower likelihood of experiencing progression
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.98; P = .04). Women

Hormonal Maintenance Therapy in Low-Grade Serous Carcinoma
 who received HMT had a significantly lower risk of progression
compared with women who underwent OBS (HR, 0.44; 95% CI,
0.31 to 0.64; P , .001). Women with stage II or III disease or
those with recurrent LMP tumors had a significantly lower risk of
progression compared with women with stage IV disease. Women
with a primary peritoneal tumor had a significantly lower risk of
progression compared with those with an ovarian primary tumor
(HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.86; P = .007). ER and PR status were
excluded from the Cox regression analysis because of the large
number of patient cases with missing data.
After including age, stage, site, and disease status at
completion of primary chemotherapy in the multivariable Cox
proportional hazards regression for OS, a lower risk of dying
was associated with age . 35 years (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37 to
0.90; P = .015), stage II or III disease or LGSC resulting from
a recurrent LMP tumor, and being disease free at completion of
primary chemotherapy (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.81;
P = .005).
DISCUSSION
The principal findings of our study indicate that women with stage
II to IV LGSC who received HMT after primary treatment had
significantly longer PFS than women who underwent OBS. Median
PFS was superior for the HMT group compared with the OBS
group not only in the entire study cohort but also in the two disease
status subgroups: women who were clinically disease free at
completion of primary chemotherapy and women with persistent
disease. Although the survival outcomes between the HMT and
OBS groups were not statistically significant in the overall study
population (P = .42), after adjusting for disease status, median OS

Gershenson et al
 for the HMT group was significantly longer than that for the OBS
group (P = .014).
By multivariable analysis, a lower likelihood of disease pro-
gression was significantly associated with age . 35 years, HMT,
stage, and primary peritoneal tumor. Factors significantly asso-
ciated with lower risk of dying included age . 35 years, stage, and
being disease free at completion of primary chemotherapy.
Over the past decade, a series of publications from our group
has indicated that LGSC is less responsive to conventional che-
motherapy than HGSC.1-6 These reports documented . 40%
frequency of persistent disease at completion of primary platinum-
based chemotherapy in women with stage II to IV LGSC of the
ovary or peritoneum1,4,5 and response rates of , 5% in both the
neoadjuvant2 and salvage chemotherapy settings.3 Recently, Gra-
bowski et al,6 reviewing more than 5,000 patients accrued to four
phase III trials in the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynaekologische
Onkologie metadatabase, found that the response rate to che-
motherapy in suboptimally debulked LGSC was significantly lower
than that in suboptimally debulked HGSC (23% v 90%,
respectively).
Some have interpreted the reports of the last decade to
conclude that platinum-based chemotherapy is of no benefit in
first-line treatment of LGSC and should be abandoned. In our
view, that perspective is premature based on available data. Al-
though LGSC is indolent and not as chemotherapy sensitive as
HGSC, it is not entirely chemotherapy resistant. Responses are
observed in some women, and although response may not be
documented based on standard imaging criteria, serum cancer
antigen 125 declines significantly in a sizable proportion of
patients.2,3,14 Furthermore, a high proportion of women have
stable disease for a period of time.2,3 The dilemma associated with
interpretation of stable disease is determining whether it is a result
of the indolent nature of LGSC or reflects a beneficial effect of
therapy. Given the absence of contradictory evidence from pro-
spective trials, platinum plus taxane chemotherapy remains the
standard postoperative treatment for women with newly diagnosed
stage II to IV LGSC. However, the reality that LGSC is relatively
chemotherapy resistant has clearly stimulated the search for al-
ternative therapies.
One such alternative therapeutic strategy is hormonal therapy.
Since the 1980s, we have known that a variety of hormonal
therapies may have modest efficacy in epithelial ovarian can-
cer.15-27 However, epithelial ovarian cancer is not a single disease
but rather several different cancers. For the past several years, our
clinical observations indicate that well-differentiated ovarian
cancers seem to respond to hormonal therapies more commonly
than poorly differentiated ovarian cancers, especially for grade 1
(now classified as low grade) serous and grade 1 endometrioid
carcinomas.
Although current evidence from clinical practice provides
clues in predicting which ovarian cancers are more likely to re-
spond to hormonal therapy, there are no definitive answers based
on systematic clinical investigations. Factors that have been studied
to varying degrees include ER status, histologic subtype, and
histologic grade. ER expression varies depending on histologic
subtype. Lindgren et al28 observed ERa expression in serous and
endometrioid carcinomas but not in mucinous carcinomas.
Fujimura et al29 reported the frequency of ERa and ERb in dif-
ferent histologic subtypes: clear cell (0% and 39.3%, respectively),
serous (97.2% and 41.7%, respectively), mucinous (70% and 30%,
respectively), and endometrioid (100% and 75%, respectively). In
addition, an Ovarian Tumor Tissue Analysis Consortium study
found higher frequencies of ER expression in LGSC (87% of 104),
HGSC (81% of 1,691), and endometrioid carcinoma (77% of 475),
compared with clear cell (20% of 381) and mucinous carcinomas
(21% of 197).30
In studies that directly compared ER expression based on
histologic grade of serous carcinoma, Wong et al10 observed
a significantly higher rate of ER expression in LGSC (58% of 43)
than in HGSC (27% of 48; P = .003). Using different immuno-
histochemical platforms and cutoff scores, Escobar et al11 reported
higher frequencies of ER expression than Wong et al in LGSC

Hormonal Maintenance Therapy in Low-Grade Serous Carcinoma
 (96%) and HGSC (83%). Of several methods used to measure ER
expression, only the Dako platform (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA)
revealed a significant difference between LGSC and HGSC.
Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between the
presence of ER and response to hormonal therapy in ovarian
cancer of all subtypes, whereas others have suggested the absence of
ER is associated with negligible response rates.22,24,27,31,32 How-
ever, to determine the true effectiveness of hormonal therapy,
subtype-specific trials for women with LGSC are clearly needed. In
our report of hormonal therapy in recurrent LGSC, we detailed the
clinical course of 64 women who received 89 separate regimens.7
Overall response rate was 9%, with an additional 62% of patient
regimens resulting in stable disease, for an overall clinical benefit
rate of 71%. Additionally, median PFS was 7.4 months. Of 50
patients with available ER and PR expression data, patients with
ER-positive/PR-positive tumors had a longer median time to
progression than those with ER-positive/PR-negative tumors. The
difference approached but did not reach statistical significance. In
the current study, information on ER expression was available in 76
(37%) of 203 patients, and only three patients were ER negative. In
all subgroup analyses (ER-positive, PR-positive, and PR-negative
patients), the HMT group had better outcomes than the OBS
group. None of the findings suggested which patients experienced
greater benefit from HMT. Because only three of 76 patients with
available data were ER negative, meaningful comparisons were not
possible.
Increasingly, LGSC seems to bear a striking resemblance to
ER-positive breast cancer. In addition to ER expression, similar
characteristics include response to anti-estrogen therapy and the
observation that women age # 35 years have significantly worse
prognosis than older women.5,7 Another common trait is that
ER-positive breast cancer seems to be less chemotherapy sensitive
than ER-negative breast cancer.33,34
The strategy of administering HMT after completion of
primary platinum-based chemotherapy evolved at our institution
over several years and was primarily based on two observations: the
relative chemotherapy resistance of LGSC and the clinical benefit of
anti-estrogen therapy in some women with recurrent LGSC. In-
terestingly, this development has essentially mirrored the standard
treatment of high-risk, ER-positive breast cancer.35

 Although a majority of patients in our HMT cohort received
aromatase inhibitors, our study does not provide major clues
regarding specific optimal endocrine therapies. Even in ER-positive
breast cancer, no single drug is considered to be the best option.
A study such as ours has several known limitations, including
its retrospective nature, long study period, incomplete data, po-
tential referral bias, heterogeneous therapies, and varying follow-
up practice patterns. Nevertheless, observational studies often yield
valid results.36,37 In addition, we found no significant differences in
the interval between prior imaging and diagnosis of disease
progression between the two groups.
As in any retrospective study, selection bias was a concern.
We sought to analyze a homogeneous cohort of women who
underwent primary treatment for this rare ovarian cancer
subtype, after which their clinical management diverged to
HMT or OBS. We wanted to explore whether HMT had any
significant impact on clinical outcome. Although women who
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were identified in our
database, this group was excluded from our study because these
patients seem to have a different clinical course. In our prior
study of 25 women with LGSC of the ovary or peritoneum
treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, median OS was
56.1 months, which is approximately half that of women who
undergo primary cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum-
based chemotherapy.2 For women who received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and were excluded from our study, median PFS
was 28.9 months, and for the subgroup who received HMT,
median PFS was 28.9 months, compared with 24.3 months for
the OBS subgroup (P = .48). In addition, their median OS was
only 59.8 months. The contrast in PFS and OS between patients
who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and those who un-
derwent primary surgery followed by chemotherapy is notable
and provides a rationale for not combining these clinically
distinct subgroups.
We also excluded patients who experienced disease pro-
gression during primary chemotherapy because, by definition,
they never had the opportunity to receive HMTor undergo OBS
before progression. Median OS for this group was 42.5 months,
which was to be expected in this poor-prognosis group. In
addition, median OS for those patients within this cohort who
subsequently received hormonal therapy for progression or
recurrence was 48.6 months, compared with 26.0 months for
those who never received hormonal therapy for progression or
recurrence.

Hormonal Maintenance Therapy in Low-Grade Serous Carcinoma
 In summary, women with stage II to IV LGSC of the ovary or
peritoneum who received HMT after primary chemotherapy had
significantly longer PFS than women who underwent OBS. The
findings of this hypothesis-generating study are potentially
practice changing and warrant further investigation using
a prospective trial design. A phase III randomized trial is cur-
rently under development to compare platinum-based chemo-
therapy followed by placebo versus platinum-based chemotherapy
followed by HMT versus hormonal therapy alone for women with
stage II to IV LGSC of the ovary or peritoneum after primary
cytoreductive surgery. On the basis of our previous experience,
women who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be ineligible
for this trial. However, patients who develop progressive disease
during primary treatment will be included in an intent-to-treat
analysis.
