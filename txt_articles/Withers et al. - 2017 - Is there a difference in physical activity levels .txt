Abstract
Objective: To determine the difference in physical activity levels before and up to one year after unilateral 
primary total hip replacement.
Data sources: A search was performed on 13 July 2016. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they 
presented preoperative and up to one year postoperative measures of physical activity for patients who 
had undergone unilateral primary total hip replacement.
Review methods: Any article that used a measure of physical activity pre and up to one year post-
unilateral primary total hip replacement. Data was synthesised using a meta-analysis with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI), if appropriate. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme cohort study checklist was used to 
assess the quality of evidence.
Results: From 6024 citations, 17 studies were selected: Nine studies were analysed in a meta-analysis and 
eight studies were analysed qualitatively. The quality of the evidence was ‘low’ to ‘moderate’. There was 
no statistically significant difference in physical activity pre- to post-total hip replacement when assessed 
using: movement-related activity (mean difference (MD): −0.08; 95% CI: 1.60, 1.44; I2 
= 
0%; n 
= 
77), 
percentage of 24-hours spent walking (MD: −0.21; 95% CI: −1.36, 0.93; I2 
= 
12%; n 
= 
65), 6-minute walk 
test (MD: −60.85; 95% CI: −122.41, 0.72; I2 
= 
84%; n 
= 
113) or the cardiopulmonary exercise test (MD: 
−0.24; 95% CI: −1.36, 0.87; I2 
= 
0%; n 
= 
76).
Conclusion: There is no statistically significant difference in physical activity levels before and up to one 
year after unilateral primary total hip replacement. However, the low to moderate methodological quality 
of the included articles should be taken into consideration when drawing conclusions.

Introduction
Total hip replacement is one of the most common 
elective orthopaedic operations. A total of 620,300 
total hip replacements were undertaken in England, 
Wales and Northern Ireland from April 2003 to 
December 20131. Osteoarthritis is the most com-
mon indication, estimated to be the principle rea-
son for 93% of total hip replacements.1 Of these 
patients, 40% are male, with the median age at 
operation being 69 years.
Physical activity is a generic term encompassing 
any activity that involves movement that results in 
an increase in heart rate and calorific expenditure, 
the amount of calories burnt.2 Physical activity can 
be subdivided into three categories: (1) everyday 
activity, e.g. active travel such as walking or 
cycling; (2) active recreation, e.g. gardening, home 
improvement or recreational walking; and (3) sport 
that may be competitive or non-competitive.2
Previous systematic reviews have focused on total 
hip replacement and exercise3–5 or alternatively have 
combined total hip and knee replacements together.6 
No previous systematic reviews have investigated the 
relationship between total hip replacement and physi-
cal activity, and specifically whether physical activity 
changes after total hip replacement. This is an impor-
tant void in the evidence-base, as physical inactivity 
has been associated with the development of numer-
ous non-communicable diseases.2 Given this, the pur-
pose of this systematic review is to answer the 
question: Is there a difference in physical activity lev-
els in patients before and up to one year after unilat-
eral total hip replacement?
Methods
This study was undertaken in accordance with the 
Cochrane collaboration guidelines.7 The electronic 
databases AMED, CINHAL, EMBASE, Medline, 
Central (Cochrane), OpenSigle, ClinicalTrials.gov 
and UK Clinical Trials Gateway were searched 
from their inception up and to the 13 July 2016. 
The reference lists of all potentially eligible articles 
identified from the search strategy were reviewed. 
An example of the search strategy is presented in 
Appendix 1, available online.
For articles to be included in this systematic 
review, all participants: Had to be over 18 years; 
had any form of elective unilateral primary total 
hip replacement; and physical activity data was 
collected before and within the first postoperative 
year. One year postoperatively was chosen as this 
study is examining immediate postoperative 
change opposed to long-term postoperative pat-
terns in physical activity. Articles were excluded if 
participants had more than one surgical procedure 
in the same operation, for example unilateral total 
hip replacement and bunion removal. Participants 
with other health conditions were included. 
Reviews were not included in the systematic 
review, but the reference list was read and any arti-
cles that fit the inclusion criteria were included. 
Any study design was included in the study. No 
date restrictions were applied. Only articles written 
in English were included.
In accordance with Cochrane Collaboration 
guidelines,7 initially article titles and abstracts 
were independently screened for eligibility by two 
reviewers (TW, SL). For those articles that were 
potentially eligible and those where eligibility was 
unclear, the full text was then obtained and 
reviewed independently by each reviewer (TW, 
SL). Articles that both reviewers agreed had met 
the eligibility criteria after reviewing the full text 
were included. Any uncertainties were resolved 
through discussion.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was change in phys-
ical activity within the initial 12 months post-total

hip replacement. Physical activity was defined 
using the British Government’s, Department of 
Health’s definition being: ‘all forms of activity 
such as everyday walking or cycling to get from “A 
to B”, active play work-related activity, active rec-
reation (such as working out in a gym), dancing, 
gardening or playing active games, as well as 
organised and competitive sport’.2 All outcomes 
that measured physical activity were considered 
for this systematic review. This included, but is not 
limited to, accelerometer and physical activity 
questionnaires, for example physical activity score 
for the elderly8 and global physical activity 
questionnaire.9
Secondary outcome measures for this study 
were considered to be any measure that measures 
physiological exercise capacity, this includes but is 
not limited to maximal and submaximal exercise 
tests. Measures of strength or power, such as 
strength dynamometry, were not considered meas-
ures of physical activity in this systematic review 
and therefore excluded. Similarly, biomechanical 
measures, such as walking speed and peak impact 
force, were not considered measures of physical 
activity, as these are measures of physiological 
and/or biomechanical efficiency.
Data extraction and critical appraisal
Data from all eligible articles were extracted 
using a data extraction table. The primary reviewer 
(TW) independently screened and extracted data 
from each eligible article. Following the inde-
pendent screening and extraction from the pri-
mary reviewer, a second reviewer (SL) checked 
the screening and extraction for accuracy. Any 
disagreement in screening or data extraction were 
resolved through discussion. A third reviewer 
(TS) was not needed to adjudicate any disagree-
ments, on this occasion there were no disagree-
ments. Data extracted included: Number of 
participants, age, gender, indication for total hip 
replacement (e.g. osteoarthritis), physical activity 
measure and pre-/postoperative total hip replace-
ment physical activity data. In the event of miss-
ing data, the corresponding authors were emailed 
and asked for further information.
All included studies were appraised using the 
Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Cohort Study 
Checklist.10 This is a 12-item appraisal tool that has 
been previously used in rehabilitation research.10 An 
additional question (6c. Was the characteristics of 
excluded participants examined?) was incorporated 
to the appraisal tool, as this was considered specifi-
cally important to this review to better ascertain gen-
eralisability and acceptability of physical activity to 
the population. All included articles were indepen-
dently assessed using this tool by one reviewer 
(TW), and verified by a second (SL). Any disagree-
ments in critical appraisal assessment were resolved 
through discussion, if needed a third reviewer (TS) 
was available to resolve any disagreements.
Data synthesis and analysis
Heterogeneity was initially assessed by examining 
the data extraction tables by three reviewers (TW, 
AC, TS). When clinical homogeneity was assumed 
a meta-analysis was deemed appropriate. If clinical 
heterogeneity was evident, a narrative review of 
the evidence was undertaken.
For each meta-analyses, statistical heterogeneity 
was assessed using I2 and Chi2 statistics. When I2 
was 20% or less and Chi2 was less than p = 0.10, a 
fixed-effects model was adopted.7 When this was 
not satisfied, a random-effect model was used.7 All 
meta-analyses were assessed as mean differences 
(MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and pre-
sented using forest plots. To determine whether age 
was a potentially important variable for outcome, a 
subgroup analysis was undertaken to assess the lev-
els of physical activity pre- vs. postoperatively, spe-
cifically for people aged 65 years or over. Analyses 
were undertaken using Review Manager software 
(Review Manager (RevMan) [Computer Program] 
Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane 
Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).
Results
Search results
A summary of the search results is presented in 
Figure 1. A total of 6024 articles were identified 
 642 
Clinical Rehabilitation 31(5)
after duplicates were removed. Of these, 17 were 
eligible and included. Nine articles provided suffi-
cient data that were used in the meta-analysis.11–18 
Eight articles19–26 were not included in the meta-
analysis as the data was either not appropriate to 
synthesise or not presented in an appropriate way 
for pooled analysis to take place.
A summary of the study appraisal results is pre-
sented in Table 1. Overall the evidence base was 
poor to moderate in quality. All studies clearly 
addressed a focused research question. All studies, 
with the exception of four, clearly explained the 
recruitment methods used.15,16,21,26
A summary of the demographic data for all 
included articles is presented in Table 2. In total, 
1030 participants were included; Arbuthnot et al.22 
did not clearly state the number of participants in 
their study. Cohort sample sizes ranged from one15 
to 88 participants.17 Three studies15,22,24 did not 
clearly state the ratio of male:female participants of 
the remaining studies, 287 (68%) participants were 
female. Of the included articles, all but one, a 
Randomized Control Trial,27 were observational, 
longitudinal studies.
A number of different measures were used to 
evaluate physical activity levels. Accelerometers

were used in three studies,13,28,29 cardiopulmonary 
exercise test, an incremental exercise test to voli-
tional exhaustion, used in three studies14–16 and the 
6-minute walk test was also used in three stud-
ies.17,18,27 Two studies analysed secondary data 
sets.19,20 A more detailed summary of measures 
used is presented in Table 3.
Clinical findings: Primary outcomes
For the primary outcome measures, change in 
physical activity, percentage of 24-hours spent 
walking were analysed from two studies using 
accelerometry.11,29 These reported no statistically 
significant difference on pooled analysis between 
pre- and post-total hip replacement at six months 
follow-up (MD: −0.21; 95% CI: −1.36 to 0.93; 
I2 = 12%; n = 65; Figure 2).
Three studies provided data on movement-
related physical activity as measured with acceler-
ometery pre- and up to one year post-total hip 
replacement.11,13,29 These studies reported no statis-
tically significant difference in pre- and postopera-
tive results on pooled analysis at six months 
follow-up (MD: −0.08; 95% CI: −1.60 to 1.44; 
I2 = 0%; n = 77; Figure 2).
Clinical findings: Secondary outcomes
For the secondary outcome measures, measures of 
physiological 
capacity, 
three 
articles 
used 
Cardiopulmonary Exercise testing, one evaluated 
this on a cycle ergometer16 and two studies used a 
treadmill.14,15 There was no statistically significant 
difference, between pre- and post-total hip replace-
ment at a mean nine-month follow-up (MD: −0.24; 
95% CI: −1.36 to 0.87; I2 = 0%; n = 76; Figure 2).
Three articles measured the 6-minute walk 
test.17,18,27 These reported no statistically significant 
different in pre- and post-total hip replacement 
results at a mean 23-week follow-up (MD: −60.85; 
95% CI: −122.41 to 0.72; I2 = 84%; n = 113; Figure 
3). A subanalysis was conducted, excluding Oosting27 
as it was the only study that looked at exclusively 
over 65 year olds. This resulted in an increase in the 
6-minute walk test from 60.9 m to 89.1 m (MD: 
−89.09; 95% CI: −136.40 to −41.79; I2 = 68%; 
n = 101; Figure 4) up to one year postoperatively.

Discussion
The methodological quality of the research included 
within this review was generally low to moderate, 
as no study fully addressed all the Critical Appraisal 
Skills Programme (CASP) criteria. Only one study18 
examined the characteristics of the excluded par-
ticipants, therefore providing limited information 
 
to ascertain if the data was representative of the 
total hip replacement population. Additionally, no 
authors attempted to identify confounding factors 
that may have influenced the level of physical activ-
ity that participants undertook. Therefore, it was 
not possible to appreciate whether cohort charac-
teristics, such as pre-existing musculoskeletal 
pain, medical morbidities, age, gender or operative 
 
technique, influenced the results, as it may have 
been previously shown that rehabilitation is a

key factor in improving outcomes post-total hip 
replacement.30,31 Additionally, it is also important to 
consider the potential of timing of preoperative 
measure and its potential effect on outcome.
Postoperative data captured occurred between 
six weeks18 to up to one year19,22,23,32,33. This there-
fore needs to be considered when drawing conclu-
sions from this systematic review. However, as 
only two articles showed a significant improve-
ment,17,18 it is suggested that this is likely to have a 
minimal affect.
While the 6-minute walk test did not reach a sta-
tistically significant difference, it may be regarded 
as clinically significant with a mean difference of 
60.9 m (95% CI: −122.4 to 0.7). Previous research in 
chronic lung disease suggests that clinically sig-
nificant difference is 54 m (95% CI: 37 to 71 m).34 
Therefore, the 60.9 m improvement in patients fol-
lowing total hip replacement reported in our analysis 
could potentially represent a significant difference. 
There is no specific data for the total hip replace-
ment population, but it is hypothesised that the clini-
cally significant difference for total hip replacement 
patients is likely to be greater than patients with 
chronic lung disease as they have an aetiology that 
results in a physiological limited exercise capacity.
The 6-minute walk test data suggests that there 
was no significant difference between distances 
covered in the 6-minute walk test between pre- 
and post-total hip replacement. However, this 
result should be interpreted with caution as the 
meta-analysis demonstrated considerable hetero-
geneity (I2 = 84%). When the Oosting et al.27 study 
was excluded alone (Figure 4), being the only 
study that exclusively recruited patients over 
65 year olds, there was an increase in the distance 
walked between pre- and post-total hip replace-
ment of 60.9 m to 89.1 m. This suggests that age 
may be a modifier of the 6-minute walk test result 
following total hip replacement. This finding 
should however be considered with considerable 
caution; as this is based on one study of 15 partici-
pants,27 more research is needed to explorer this 
potential link. Additionally, studies in healthy pop-
ulations have shown that age is a non-significant 
(p > 0.05) predictor of 6-minute walk distance35 
and there is no clear reason to suggest why there 
is a difference.
However, both pre- and postoperatively, the 
mean 6-minute walk test is noticeably less than the 
population mean. Heiberg et al.17 was the article 
that showed the greatest distance pre- and postop-
eratively, 401 ±113 m and 512 ±88 m, respectively, 
though the reference values for 55–75 years old, is 
659 ±62 m.35 This noticeable difference is sugges-
tive that it is not purely the reason for the total hip 
replacement that may result in the decrease in 6- 
minute walk distance compared with the mean for 
the age group. There is therefore a need to under-
stand better the other factors that may contribute to 
this decrease in physical activity in this population.
The previous methods of measurement 
 
discussed above could be referred to as ‘non- 
laboratory’ or ‘free-living’ based, that being that 
the measures have been undertaken in the natural 
environment and therefore not under controlled 
‘experimental’ conditions.36 However the cardio-
pulmonary exercise test does use ‘lab-based’ 
measures. It is important to note that while the 
cardiopulmonary exercise test may not be consid-
ered a measure of physical activity, as it is a meas-
ure of exercise capacity, it was included in this 
systematic review as it is an indirect, surrogate 
measure of physical activity.36 This systematic 
review reported that there is no significant change 
in cardiopulmonary exercise test output between 
pre- and post-total hip replacement.
This study provides important information for 
healthcare professionals with regard to physical 
activity post-total hip replacement. Contrary to 
previous understanding, this systematic review 
does not support the hypothesis that patients are 
more physically active following total hip replace-
ment. Instead, based on limited but available evi-
dence, this systematic review reports that there is 
no change in physical activity following unilateral 
primary total hip replacement. Qualitative research 
suggests that when people prior to total hip replace-
ment are asked what their activity aspirations are 
postoperatively, the most common goal is to return 
to the level of physical activity that they were 
undertaking before their hip disease or condition 
impacted on their lifestyle.37 However, the results 
of this meta-analysis suggest that while this may be 
an aspiration, it does not consistently occur post-
total hip replacement.37

As the benefits of regular physical activity are 
well documented and widely reported,38 this sys-
tematic review suggests that a greater effort or new 
methods need to be developed to engage total hip 
replacement patients into becoming more physi-
cally active. Identifying barriers to physical activ-
ity engagement, and strategies to address these is 
therefore an important research to improve the 
overall health and wellbeing of this population.
To conclude, there appears no statistically sig-
nificant change in physical activity between pre- 
and post-total hip replacements. However, the low 
to moderate methodological quality of the included 
studies should be considered when drawing such 
conclusions. Further research is warranted to better 
understand the changes in physical activity between 
pre- and post-total hip replacement and how peo-
ple’s perceptions of physical activity may be modi-
fied to increase engagement in physical activity.
