Abstract
Objective
We investigated whether cognitive performance between ages 43 and 69 years was associated
with timing of menopause, controlling for hormone replacement therapy, childhood cognitive
ability, and sociobehavioral factors.
Methods
We used data from 1,315 women participating in the Medical Research Council National
Survey of Health and Development (a British birth cohort study) with known age at period
cessation and up to 4 assessments of verbal memory (word-learning task) and processing speed
(letter-cancellation task) at ages 43, 53, 60–64, and 69. We fitted multilevel models with linear
and quadratic age terms, stratified by natural or surgical menopause, and adjusted for hormone
replacement therapy, body mass index, smoking, occupational class, education, and childhood
cognitive ability.
Results
Verbal memory increased with later age at natural menopause (0.17 words per year, 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 0.07–0.27, p = 0.001); an association remained, albeit attenuated, after
full adjustment (0.09, 95% CI: 0.02–0.17, p = 0.013). Verbal memory also increased with later
age at surgical menopause (0.16, 95% CI: 0.06–0.27, p = 0.002), but this association was fully
attenuated after adjustment. Search speed was not associated with age at menopause.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest lifelong hormonal processes, not just short-term fluctuations during the
menopause transition, may be associated with verbal memory, consistent with evidence from
a variety of neurobiological studies; mechanisms are likely to involve estrogen receptor β
function. Further follow-up is required to assess fully the clinical significance of these
associations.

 A recent review of 13 observational studies showed that later
age at menopause and longer reproductive life are generally
associated with better cognitive function or delayed cognitive
decline. However, a call was made for the evidence to be
strengthened by using prospective studies with larger, age-
homogeneous samples, longer follow-up periods, repeated
cognitive assessments, and adjustment for a wider range of
sociobehavioral factors associated with timing or type of
menopause and cognition.1,2
Using data from birth cohort studies, we and others have shown
that higher prior cognitive ability, assessed as early as child-
hood, is associated with later age at natural menopause,3–6
hysterectomy,7 and later cognitive function,8,9 and attenuated
cross-sectional associations between menopausal status and
cognition.10 Lifelong studies are required given this evidence,
and the broader evidence from animal and human studies
showing pleiotropic effects of estrogen across life on the central
and peripheral nervous systems, reproductive, and other body
systems.11–13
In a British birth cohort study, we investigated whether verbal
memory and processing speed, assessed 4 times between ages
43 and 69, were associated with timing of period cessation due
to natural or surgical menopause. The study controlled for
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use, body size, adult
socioeconomic factors, smoking, education, and childhood
cognitive ability. We hypothesized that later natural or sur-
gical menopause would be associated with better cognition
but would be explained by childhood cognitive ability and
other covariables.
Methods
The Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of
Health and Development (NSHD) is a sample of all births in
1 week in March 1946 in mainland Britain comprising 5,362
(2,547 female) individuals followed up 24 times, so far to age
69, with a further 9 postal questionnaires to women during
midlife.14 The maximum sample for these analyses comprised
1,315 women with information on age at period cessation and
at least one adult cognitive assessment. Of the original birth
cohort, 288 (11.3%) had already died, 246 (9.7%) were living
abroad, 403 (15.8%) had been lost to follow-up, and 295
(11.6%) had not provided all necessary data.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents
Ethical approval for the most recent visit was given by Queen
Square Research Ethics Committee (13/LO/1073) and
Scotland A Research Ethics Committee (14/SS/1009). Par-
ticipants provided written informed consent for each visit.
Adult cognition
Trained nurses assessed verbal memory at 43, 53, 60–64, and
69 years using a 15-item word-learning task repeated 3 times
giving a maximum possible score of 45. Two sets of word lists
were alternated over waves to minimize practice effects. They
also assessed processing speed using a visual search task re-
quiring participants to cross out as quickly and accurately as
possible, in 1 minute, the letters P and W randomly embedded
in a grid of other letters; the maximum score was 600.4,8
Type and timing of menopause
We obtained information on menstrual irregularity, month
and year of last menstrual cycle, any operation to remove the
uterus or ovaries (validated against hospital records), and
monthly HRT use from the home visits and annual postal
questionnaires between ages 47 and 54 (inclusive) and at age
57. We calculated months since birth until periods ceased
naturally, or because of bilateral oophorectomy (with or
without hysterectomy), or because of hysterectomy with or
without unilateral oophorectomy. We excluded women
whose periods stopped for other reasons (n = 37), such as
chemotherapy. We also excluded 122 women starting HRT
before menopause who had not ceased HRT for at least a year
from the main analyses because it was not possible to assign
a date of menopause; however, they contributed to additional
HRT analyses.
Other covariables
We chose covariables based on the scientific literature, in-
cluding previous NSHD studies that have shown that child-
hood cognitive ability, education, body size, smoking, and
occupational
class
were
associated
with
cognitive
scores,8,15–17 and related to type or timing of period
cessation.3,4,18–20 From reported monthly histories of HRT,
we derived “ever use” (yes vs no), use at the time of the
cognitive tests, years of use, and years since last use. We
derived body mass index (BMI) from height (m) and weight
(kg) measured according to standard protocols at each nurse
visit. We categorized the participant’s own current or most
recent occupation into 6 classes (from professional to un-
skilled manual) according to the Registrar General’s social
classification. In addition, we distinguished those who
reported smoking at least one cigarette a day at each of the
nurse visits from lifelong nonsmokers and ex-smokers. We
classified highest educational qualifications attained by age 26
into the following: degree or higher; advanced secondary
qualifications, usually attained at age 18; ordinary secondary
qualifications, usually obtained at age 16; lower level

 qualifications; and none. We derived a standardized measure
of childhood cognitive ability from tests of reading compre-
hension, pronunciation, vocabulary, and nonverbal reasoning
at age 8, chosen because previous NSHD research had shown
that the association between childhood cognitive ability and
timing of menopause was strongest at this age.3,4
Main analyses
We used Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX)
for all analyses. For each cognitive test, we fitted multilevel
models that account for the correlation of repeated cognitive
scores within individuals. In preliminary analyses for verbal
memory including linear and quadratic terms for age, there
was evidence of an interaction between type of menopause
and both age terms (p < 0.05), so we performed all analyses
separately for natural and surgical menopause. We modeled
change in verbal memory and processing speed by linear and
quadratic age terms, and fitted intercept and slope as random
effects.
We first included age at period cessation and its interaction
with each age term to test whether changes in cognitive scores
varied by age at period cessation. We then performed a series
of adjustments: for HRT use as a time-varying covariable;
additionally for BMI and smoking as time-varying covariables,
educational qualifications and own occupational class; and
additionally for childhood cognitive ability. We added each
covariable with any relevant age interactions. In the model for
women who had surgical menopause, we tested whether the
associations of bilateral oophorectomy were different from
the associations of hysterectomy with conservation of at least
one ovary, and whether the effect of age at surgery or HRT on
verbal memory was modified by type of procedure.
Additional analyses
We compared the mean and SDs of each cognitive score at
each age in the maximum available samples by age at period
cessation and type of menopause, then stratified by meno-
pause type and repeated the age at period cessation analyses
(tables e-1 to e-5, links.lww.com/WNL/A428). We used
linear regression models to test these relationships. To check
that the results were not influenced by morbidity associated
with surgery performed for cancers, we reran the multilevel
models excluding those cases. Considering some published
evidence that associations with surgical menopause may be
weaker with increasing age at time of procedure, we then reran
the models excluding women who had a surgical menopause
after age 50.21 We also checked whether additionally adjusting
for parity affected the results. Because the sample with known
age at period cessation did not include all women who took
HRT, we ran linear regression models, stratified by type of
menopause, to examine the associations between verbal
memory and processing speed at age 69 with ever use, dura-
tion, and years since last use of HRT. We adjusted for cova-
riables and additionally adjusted for the same cognitive test at
age 43 to test whether HRT use was associated with rate of
decline.

Results
In the maximum sample, mean number of words recalled in
the memory test was highest at age 43 and lowest at age 69;
mean processing speed was lower at every subsequent age
(table 1).
Mean age at period cessation was 49 years, 7 months: 72%
had a natural menopause (mean age 51 years, 7 months),
12% a bilateral oophorectomy (mean age 47 years, 5
months), and 16% a hysterectomy with at least one con-
served ovary (mean age 41 years, 6 months) before the
natural menopause. HRT use was greatest at age 53 with
small numbers of women taking HRT at other ages. Overall,
64% had taken HRT, almost half for 3 or more years, al-
though only 16% had been taking it in the 5 years preceding
the last cognitive assessment (table 1). Between ages 43 and
69, mean BMI increased and prevalence of smoking de-
creased. While the majority of women were in nonmanual
occupations, more than a third (36%) had no educational
qualifications. Those not providing complete data had sim-
ilar characteristics to those with complete data. Women lost
to follow-up were more likely to have been smokers, had
a slightly higher BMI at age 43, and had lower childhood
cognitive ability, educational attainment, and occupational
class.
Multilevel models for verbal memory, ages
43–69 years
In 846 women with a natural menopause and complete
covariable data, verbal memory increased with later age at
natural menopause (table 2A, model 1). There was no
evidence of an interaction with age, the association
remaining constant across all ages. Adjusting for HRT use
(model 2) did not change this estimate; further adjusting
for BMI, educational attainment, and occupational class
resulted in some attenuation (model 3) as did further ad-
justment for childhood cognitive ability (model 4). How-
ever, an association between later age at menopause and
a higher verbal memory score remained after full adjust-
ment (model 4).

 In 313 women with a hysterectomy or bilateral oopho-
rectomy and complete covariable data, verbal memory
increased with later age at surgery (table 2B, model 1).
There was no evidence of an interaction with age, no dif-
ference in memory by type of procedure, and no in-
teraction between age at surgery and type of procedure.
Adjusting for HRT use (model 2) did not change the es-
timate for age at period cessation; there was no interaction
between HRT use and type of procedure. Further adjust-
ing for BMI, educational attainment, and occupational
class more than halved this estimate (model 3), and after
adjusting for childhood cognitive ability, no association
remained (model 4).
Childhood cognitive ability, educational attainment, and oc-
cupational class were the covariables with the strongest
associations with verbal memory (table e-1, links.lww.com/
WNL/A428). HRT use at the time of cognitive assessment
was not associated with verbal memory for women with
a natural menopause; however, for women with surgical
menopause, HRT use was associated with a lower verbal
memory score and this inverse association remained in the
fully adjusted models.
Multilevel models for processing speed, ages
43–69 years
In 847 women with a natural menopause and complete
covariable data, processing speed was not associated with age
at natural menopause in any of the models (table 3A, models
1–4). In the fully adjusted model, there was an inverse asso-
ciation with BMI and an association with childhood cognitive
ability that increased with age (table e-2, links.lww.com/
WNL/A428, model 2). In 314 women with a hysterectomy or
bilateral oophorectomy and complete covariable data, neither
age at surgical procedure nor any of the covariables were
associated with processing speed (table 3B, table e-2).
Additional analyses
The results at each age were consistent with results of the
multilevel models (tables e-3 and e-4, links.lww.com/WNL/
A428). The results from the multilevel models were essen-
tially unchanged after (1) excluding 28 women who un-
derwent surgery for cancer (24 had surgical menopause and 4
had surgery after a natural menopause), (2) excluding 48
women who had surgical menopause after age 50, and (3)
additionally adjusting for parity. There was no evidence that
ever using HRT, length of use, or years since last use were

 associated with verbal memory at age 69. For processing
speed, there was some evidence that HRT use was associated
with faster processing speed in women who had a bilateral
oophorectomy (table e-5).
Discussion
In a large, national population-based British birth cohort,
women who had a later natural menopause maintained a small
benefit in verbal memory but not processing speed through to
age 69 compared with women with earlier menopause. This
benefit was not seen for women who had a surgical meno-
pause after adjustments, or for HRT users. Our longitudinal
findings suggest that the association between timing of natural
menopause and cognition is not just transient22 but is present
throughout midlife and persists into the seventh decade. This
supports the idea that the relationship between age at period
cessation and verbal memory is driven by lifelong processes
(such as lifetime estrogen exposure) rather than short-term
hormonal fluctuations at the menopause transition.
Our long length of follow-up complements the US SWAN
(Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation) study, estab-
lished to address many of the limitations of previous studies,
which showed transient cognitive decrements in peri-
menopause that did not remain post menopause.22 Our study
supports and extends previous studies1 by having repeat
cognitive assessments and by adjusting not only for education
(which many of the studies have done) but also adult occu-
pational class and childhood cognition, which were each
shown to be independently associated with verbal memory.
Only one other study has adjusted for childhood cognitive
ability6 and found no association between timing of meno-
pause and general cognitive function in a Scottish birth cohort
at age 65.
We found age at natural menopause was associated with
verbal memory but not processing speed. This differential
effect is consistent with evidence from a variety of neurobi-
ological studies. Mechanisms are likely to involve estrogen
receptor β function; for example, this regulates brain-derived
neurotrophic factor, which in turn solidifies memory forma-
tion and storage among other neuroprotective functions.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor has a particularly high
concentration in the hippocampus, a subcortical brain struc-
ture important for memory.23
Despite similar unadjusted associations of ages at natural and
surgical menopause with verbal memory, the latter association
was explained by other factors. Previous studies have not
always distinguished between type of menopause,1 or type of
and reasons for surgery,21 and results have been inconsistent.
However, Bove et al.24 showed in 2 longitudinal studies that
earlier age at surgical menopause was associated with faster
decline in global cognition and increased Alzheimer disease
neuropathology, controlling only for age, education, smoking,
and cohort. Other studies have shown that women who have
a surgical menopause have faster cognitive decline than those
who have a natural menopause. For example, in an analysis of
3 trials, bilateral oophorectomy was associated with decline in
visual memory over 2.7 years in women having the procedure
after age 45, and with decline in semantic memory for women
having the procedure before age 45, compared with natural
menopause.25 In our study, we found small differences in
verbal memory by type of menopause.
The effects of HRT use on cognition or dementia risk were
originally thought to be positive,26 until the results of the
Women’s Health Initiative showed adverse effects in older
women.27,28 The possibility that HRT could be beneficial
during a “critical window” at the time of the menopause
transition29,30 led to a follow-up study31 and recent trials in
younger women32,33 that showed no such beneficial effects on
cognition. Our study showed that, for most women, there was
no evidence that HRT use promoted better cognitive
performance—indeed, estimates were generally negative. Our
additional analyses showed HRT use was only protective for
processing speed in women with a bilateral oophorectomy.
HRT use decreased in this cohort during 2002 (age 56) at the
time of adverse trial reports,34 and later-born cohorts have
been less likely to use HRT. Therefore, our HRT results may
not be generalizable to later-born cohorts. Given the decrease
in HRT use, HRT may have only been prescribed to women
at probable high risk of adverse health conditions thought to
be associated with early period cessation. This could have
weakened any positive associations between HRT use and
cognition. However, our findings are consistent with the re-
cent trials in younger women32,33 and with the Women’s
Health Initiative/Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study,
which showed an increase in dementia cases in women aged
65 to 79 years in the combined and estrogen-only arms of the
trial.27,28 Findings from the Women’s Health Initiative
Memory Study–MRI were consistent in showing that women
receiving HRT had significant losses of gray matter compared
with the placebo groups.35
The relatively large gaps between cognitive assessments in our
study are a limitation. Those lost to follow-up (but not those
with missing data) had less favorable childhood cognitive
ability and sociobehavioral characteristics, and their exclusion
may have led to weaker associations between menopause
timing and adult cognition. HRT dose was not collected and
data on types of HRT preparations were insufficiently com-
plete to use. However, the vast majority receiving HRT who
had undergone a hysterectomy or oophorectomy were taking
estrogen alone, whereas other women were taking a combined
preparation.36 Data on length of use, age at last use, and
whether HRT use was initiated close to period cessation were
advantages over studies that only collected measures of cur-
rent and past HRT use.

 investigate common early-life factors associated with life-
long reproductive and cognitive function. Key strengths of
our study are its relatively large sample of women of the
same age, prospective data on type of menopause, age at
period cessation and HRT, childhood cognitive ability,
repeat measures of fluid cognition across adult life, and the
approximately 15 years of follow-up since menopause for
most women.
The HRT findings are of relevance to National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence recommendations for good
quality observational studies controlling for the effect of im-
portant confounders on how early HRT use affects dementia
risk in women with early menopause.37 Overall, the implica-
tions of our findings are that modifiable factors that delay
reproductive aging, in addition to those that promote cogni-
tive development, may have small beneficial effects on later-
life cognition. While this finding is of etiologic relevance, the
benefits are small: the difference in verbal memory scores in
the fully adjusted models for a 10-year difference in age at
natural menopause was one word, equivalent to a sixth of
a standard deviation on that score. Continued follow-up will
determine whether this benefit to memory eventually trans-
lates into reduced dementia risk.

Study question
Is timing of period cessation due to natural or surgical meno-
pause associated with verbal memory and processing speed
between ages 43 and 69?
Summary answer
Even after adjusting for hormone replacement therapy (HRT),
body mass index (BMI), education, occupational class, and
childhood cognitive ability, later age at menopause was associated
with higher verbal memory scores among women with natural
menopause. Among women with surgical menopause, no asso-
ciations remained following adjustment.
What is known and what this paper adds
A recent review of 13 observational studies reported that later
age at menopause and longer reproductive life are generally
associated with better cognitive function or delayed cognitive
decline. This study strengthens the evidence by using an age
homogeneous sample, a long follow-up, repeated cognitive
assessments, and adjustment for prior cognition. The findings
suggest that modifiable factors that delay reproductive ageing,
in addition to those that promote cognitive development, may
have small beneficial effects on later life cognition.
Participants and setting
The study included data from 1,315 women study members
from the Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey
of Health and Development (NSHD), a sample of all births
during 1 week in March 1946 in mainland Britain.
Design, size, and duration
Trained nurses assessed verbal memory and processing speed
at 43, 53, 60–64, and 69 years of age. Information on men-
strual irregularity, month and year of last menstrual cycle, any
operation to remove the uterus or ovaries, and monthly HRT
use was obtained from home visits and annual postal ques-
tionnaires. Multi-level models were used to examine whether
changes in cognitive scores varied by age at period cessation,
while controlling for the following factors: HRT, BMI,
smoking, education, occupational class, and childhood cog-
nitive ability.
Main results and the role of chance
In women with a natural menopause and complete covari-
able data, verbal memory increased with later age at natural
menopause. Childhood cognitive ability, educational at-
tainment, and occupational class exhibited the strongest
associations with verbal memory. There was no association
between timing of surgical menopause and verbal memory
after full adjustment.
Bias, confounding, and other reasons
for caution
During the study, there were relatively large gaps between
cognitive assessments. Exclusion of those lost to follow-up
may have led to weaker associations between the timing of
menopause and adult cognition.
Generalizability to other populations
The results may be generalizable to women at various stages
following menopause, although further research is required.
