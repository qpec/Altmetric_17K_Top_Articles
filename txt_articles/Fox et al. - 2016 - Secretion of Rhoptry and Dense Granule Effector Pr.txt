Abstract
Nonreplicating type I uracil auxotrophic mutants of Toxoplasma gondii possess a potent
ability to activate therapeutic immunity to established solid tumors by reversing immune
suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Here we engineered targeted deletions of par-
asite secreted effector proteins using a genetically tractable Δku80 vaccine strain to show
that the secretion of specific rhoptry (ROP) and dense granule (GRA) proteins by uracil
auxotrophic mutants of T. gondii in conjunction with host cell invasion activates antitumor
immunity through host responses involving CD8α+ dendritic cells, the IL-12/interferon-
gamma (IFN-γ) TH1 axis, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Deletion of parasitophorous
vacuole membrane (PVM) associated proteins ROP5, ROP17, ROP18, ROP35 or ROP38,
intravacuolar network associated dense granule proteins GRA2 or GRA12, and GRA24
which traffics past the PVM to the host cell nucleus severely abrogated the antitumor
response. In contrast, deletion of other secreted effector molecules such as GRA15,
GRA16, or ROP16 that manipulate host cell signaling and transcriptional pathways, or dele-
tion of PVM associated ROP21 or GRA3 molecules did not affect the antitumor activity.
Association of ROP18 with the PVM was found to be essential for the development of the
antitumor responses. Surprisingly, the ROP18 kinase activity required for resistance to IFN-
γ activated host innate immunity related GTPases and virulence was not essential for the
antitumor response. These data show that PVM functions of parasite secreted effector mol-
ecules, including ROP18, manipulate host cell responses through ROP18 kinase virulence
independent mechanisms to activate potent antitumor responses. Our results demonstrate
that PVM associated rhoptry effector proteins secreted prior to host cell invasion and dense
granule effector proteins localized to the intravacuolar network and host nucleus that are
secreted after host cell invasion coordinately control the development of host immune
responses that provide effective antitumor immunity against established ovarian cancer.

 Author Summary
Toxoplasma gondii extensively manipulates cellular signaling pathways and host immune
responses through secreted effector proteins, yet the host rapidly establishes T cell immu-
nity to control acute infection thereby permitting survival of the host as well as survival of
the parasite in latent infection. Recently, vaccination of mice bearing highly aggressive
ovarian cancer with a safe nonreplicating, noncyst forming, vaccine strain of T. gondii was
shown to effectively reverse tumor associated immune suppression and activate potent
antitumor immunity. Using a new genetically tractable Δku80 vaccine strain of T. gondii
we deleted multiple parasite secreted effector molecules to explore parasite specific mecha-
nisms associated with the development of potent antitumor immunity. Our results dem-
onstrate that specialized effector proteins secreted by T. gondii both before and after host
cell invasion trigger and coordinately control the development of a potent antitumor
response. Consequently, tracking and understanding the host cell pathways manipulated
by these T. gondii secreted effector proteins can reveal fundamental mechanisms control-
ling immunity to infection and can also identify relevant mammalian cell mechanisms as
new targets for devising more effective therapies against highly aggressive solid tumors.
Introduction
Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasite that chronically infects a wide array of warm-
blooded vertebrates following the oral ingestion of infectious oocysts or tissue cysts in contami-
nated water or food [1]. The primary infection is typically subclinical with minor or no appar-
ent disease due to strong immune control, yet T. gondii invariably establishes long-term
infection of the host by developing latent tissue cysts [1]. Infection during pregnancy can harm
the fetus, and reactivation of latent stages because of immune deficiency (AIDS, cancer chemo-
therapy, transplantation) causes severe and potentially lethal toxoplasmosis infections [2].
There are no currently approved vaccines to prevent toxoplasmosis in humans, or vaccines to
prevent infection of cats which host the sexual parasite stages and disseminate infectious
oocysts into the environment [3]. Remarkably, uracil auxotrophic vaccine strains of T. gondii
that do not replicate or cause infection in mammals retain a dynamic ability to activate protec-
tive immunity to T. gondii [4–14] as well as protective immunity to established highly aggres-
sive pancreatic, melanoma, and ovarian tumors [15–20].
The remarkable biological ability of T. gondii to manipulate the immune system most likely
originates from its life style as an obligate intracellular parasite. The parasite as well as the host
must both survive the acute infection to permit the development of latent infection that is
essential for the transmission of T. gondii to new hosts [21]. To accomplish this, T. gondii
extensively manipulates its host cells through the secretion of specialized effector proteins
[21,22]. Secreted rhoptry (ROP) effector proteins originating from the apical rhoptry organelle
are injected directly into the host cell cytosol prior to active invasion of the host cell and forma-
tion of the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) [23,24]. After host cell invasion, many of these ROP
effectors traffic specifically to the nascent PV membrane (PVM) to establish PVM functions
required for parasite replication and survival [23,25]. Rhoptry secreted effectors are also
injected into parasite contacted host cells that are not subsequently invaded [26–28], suggesting
that parasite manipulation of host cells occurs in both the parasite invaded as well as in the par-
asite injected noninvaded cell populations. After PVM formation, effectors are secreted from
parasite dense granules (GRA proteins) into the PV lumen and these GRA proteins traffic to
the intravacuolar network (IVN) of nanotubular membranes, to the PVM and its extensions,
to the host cell cytosol, or to the host cell nucleus [29]. The PV avoids acidification and fusion

 with host endolysosomes [30,31], and host cell endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria
closely associate with the PVM [30,32,33]. A parasite secreted protein (MAF1) mediates the
association of mitochondria to the PVM and modulates host inflammatory cytokines [34].
The host rapidly recognizes T. gondii and drives a TH1-biased immune response marked by
the cytokine IL-12 [35]. CD8α+ dendritic cells drive the initial IL-12 response downstream of
TLR11/12 mediated activation of MyD88 [36–38]. Production of IL-12 is required for the
development of protective T cell populations [11,12] and immune control is ultimately
achieved by T cell populations that produce the cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)
[7,8,11,39,40], and by cytolytic CD8+ T cell populations [8,41]. IFN-γ activates cell autono-
mous host immunity related GTPases (IRGs) [42–47]. In addition, host guanylate binding pro-
teins associate with the PVM [48–53] and components of autophagy also associate with the
PVM after exposure to IFN-γ but fail to activate degradative macroautophagy [54–58].
T. gondii strain types exhibit variation in their level of virulence. Virulent type I strains
invariably kill laboratory and outbred strains of mice, while type II and III strains are markedly
less virulent [3]. Strain type dependent virulence is linked to polymorphisms in secreted pro-
teins such as ROP5 and ROP18 that form PVM associated complexes to resist IFN-γ activated
IRG dependent innate killing mechanisms [59–72], and virulence is also correlated with the
exact ROP5 and ROP18 allele combinations [73]. ROP5 and ROP18 were also recently identi-
fied as virulence factors in divergent South American strains of T. gondii [74] and in less viru-
lent type II strains [75]. The ROP18 kinase activity directly inactivates innate immunity by
phosphorylation of host IRGs [63]. ROP18 also inhibits host transcription factor NF-κβ signal-
ing through association with its p65 subunit [76] and ROP18's association with the host ER
stress sensor ATF6β interferes with antigen presentation [77]. Thus ROP18 manipulates innate
and adaptive immunity as well as host cell signaling pathways. The ROP38 secreted effector
molecule extensively modulates host cell transcriptional programming and gene expression
profiles [78], and while this molecule does not influence parasite virulence, it is required for
establishing latent infection [75]. Dense granule (GRA) secreted effectors also play important
roles in host cell manipulation [34,79–82]. In particular, ROP16 [83–85], GRA15 [86], and
GRA24 [87] manipulate host cell signaling pathways and their associated biological outputs
can either promote or inhibit production of IL-12 by the invaded host cell in a parasite strain
type dependent manner. Parasite modulation of the IL-12 response is significant because T.
gondii preferentially invades dendritic cells [88] that are responsible for initiating the host IL-
12 response necessary for the development of protective T cell populations [89]. Consequently,
active invasion of the host cell by T. gondii uniquely creates a nonfusogenic PV hospitable for
intracellular parasite replication and parasite infection while extensively modifying host cell
behavior through functions of ROP and GRA secreted effector proteins [21,22].
Uracil auxotrophic vaccine strains [5,13,14] have emerged as important models to dissect
the parasite-host interaction and to investigate host and parasite mechanisms that determine
the development of life-long CD8+ T cell dependent immunity [4–14]. Nonreplicating uracil
auxotrophs permit the evaluation of infected host cells manipulated by secreted effector pro-
teins in the absence of parasite replication and destruction of the host cell. Uracil auxotrophs
preferentially invade myeloid cell types [4,16–19] and more quickly stimulate protective CD8+
T cell responses in comparison to replicating strains of T. gondii [4,7,8,14,18]. Nonreplicating
uracil auxotrophs also preferentially target and invade CD11c+ and myeloid cell populations in
aggressive models of murine pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and ovarian cancer to convert tol-
erogenic tumor microenvironments into immune stimulatory microenvironments
[15,16,19,20]. Uracil auxotrophs stimulate high-level expression of co-stimulatory molecules
CD80 and CD86 as well as IL-12, and tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cell populations that
mediate the long-term survival of tumor-bearing mice [15,16,19,20].

 Here, we developed targeted deletion mutants using genetically tractable Δku80 uracil auxotro-
phic vaccine strains to explore the extent to which parasite secreted ROP and GRA effector proteins
are associated with mechanisms that promote CD8+ T cell dependent therapeutic immunity to estab-
lished highly aggressive ovarian tumors [16,90]. Our results reveal that rhoptry secretion, host cell
invasion, formation of the PVM, formation of the IVN, and the secretion of dense granule proteins
to the host cell nucleus are essential for the development of the antitumor response. The ROP18
kinase activity that mediates parasite virulence was not essential for this antitumor response. How-
ever, ROP18 PVM localization, other PVM localized rhoptry molecules (ROP5, ROP17, ROP35 and
ROP38), and dense granule molecules that localized to the IVN (GRA2 and GRA12) or to the host
cell nucleus (GRA24) were essential to trigger the development of this potent antitumor immunity.
Results
Immunity to T. gondii does not diminish the potency of the antitumor
response stimulated by uracil auxotrophs
Therapeutic vaccination of established highly aggressive and immunosuppressive ID8-Defβ29/
Vegf-A (ID8DV) ovarian tumors [90,91] with the nonreplicating type I uracil auxotrophic vac-
cine strain CPS [5] was shown to preferentially target CD11c+ antigen presenting cells to
reverse tumor associated immune suppression and promote tumor antigen specific CD8+ T
cell dependent antitumor immunity [16–18]. To identify parasite and host mechanisms that
mediate this potent antitumor response we utilized a genetically tractable nonreverting CPS-
like type I uracil auxotrophic vaccine strain (the OMP mutant) [13] developed in the RHΔku80
background [92] that enables highly efficient targeted genetic manipulations. We first verified
that a three-dose OMP or CPS intraperitoneal vaccination protocol delivered sequentially at 8,
20, and 32 days after ID8DV ovarian tumor challenge markedly prolonged the survival of
tumor-bearing mice to a similar degree (Fig 1A). OMP vaccination delivered systemically by
the intravenous route provided a mean survival of 54 days while intraperitoneal vaccination
provided a mean survival of 59 days (S1A Fig). Additional OMP vaccinations delivered at
12-day intervals markedly enhanced the survival of ovarian tumor-bearing mice (Fig 1B), sug-
gesting that the underlying therapeutic immune responses were triggered even after immunity
to T. gondii was established. Moreover, aged mice with established long-term vaccine induced
immunity to T. gondii infection (S1B Fig) exhibited equivalent therapeutic benefits to those of
age matched nonimmune naive mice (Fig 1C). These results suggest that previous protective
immune responses induced by uracil auxotrophs in tumor-bearing mice did not abrogate the
efficacy of additional sequentially delivered vaccinations with uracil auxotrophs.
The IL-12/IFN-γ TH1 axis is required for optimal antitumor responses
IL-12 was previously shown to be important to the antitumor response to ID8DV tumors
induced by therapeutic vaccination with uracil auxotrophs [16]. To verify the involvement of
the host IL-12/IFN-γ TH1 axis in the antitumor response we vaccinated ID8DV tumor-bearing
IL-12p35-/- mice with uracil auxotrophs. IL-12p35-/- mice lacking the ability to produce bioac-
tive IL-12p70 (IL12-p35 + IL12-p40 subunits) mounted no detectable antitumor response (Fig
2A). IL-12p40-/- mice also exhibited no antitumor response after vaccination (S2 Fig). Despite
the recognized importance of MyD88 signaling in driving high level IL-12 production in
response to T. gondii infection [37], vaccination of MyD88-/- mice bearing ID8DV tumors pro-
vided a therapeutic benefit equivalent to vaccination of wild-type tumor-bearing mice (Fig 2B).
Together these results suggested that IL-12 production via a MyD88 independent mechanism
was sufficient to drive the antitumor response induced by uracil auxotrophs.

 The CD8α+ dendritic cell subset is a critical source of IL-12 required for immune control of
T. gondii infection [36]. To address the role of CD8α+ dendritic cells in the antitumor response
we established ID8DV tumors in basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like 3 deficient
(Batf3-/-) mice which exhibit a loss of CD8α+ dendritic cells [93], and vaccinated these tumors.
The antitumor response triggered by vaccination with uracil auxotrophs was severely abro-
gated in Batf3-/- mice (Fig 2C). These data argue that the CD8α+ dendritic cell subset confers
critical mechanisms required for the stimulation of antitumor immunity.
Production of protective IFN-γ in response to T. gondii infection is highly dependent on
production of IL-12 [35]. To investigate the role for IFN-γ in the antitumor response we estab-
lished ID8DV tumors in IFN-γ deficient mice (IFN-γ-/-) and vaccinated these mice. Production
of IFN-γ was required for the therapeutic benefit (Fig 2D). In addition, IFN-γ deficient mice
developed ID8DV ovarian tumors more rapidly and succumbed faster to ovarian cancer than
wild-type mice (Fig 2D). Collectively, these results suggested that CD8α+ dendritic cells play a
key role in stimulating the IL-12/IFN-γ TH1 axis to promote antitumor immunity.
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are required for optimal antitumor responses
We previously reported that therapeutic vaccination of established ID8DV ovarian tumors
with uracil auxotrophs stimulated a significant increase in ovarian tumor antigen specific

(A) ID8DV ovarian tumors were established in C57BL/6 mice and groups of mice were treated with phosphate buffered saline

[5]) at 8, 20, and 32 d after tumor challenge (the three-dose treatment schedule). (B) ID8DV ovarian tumors were established in
C57BL/6 mice and groups of mice were treated with PBS or were vaccinated once (8 d), twice (8, 20 d), three times (8, 20, 32 d),

auxotrophs using the three-dose treatment schedule. Data is representative of at least two independent experiments. ns was not

 CD8+ T cells as well as total T cell populations that limited ovarian tumor development [16].
To verify the protective T cell populations required for this antitumor immunity we examined
tumor development in CD8 deficient mice (CD8-/-). Vaccinated tumor-bearing CD8-/- mice
exhibited no therapeutic benefit, and treatment accelerated disease in CD8-/- mice (Fig 3A).
Similar results were observed after depletion of CD8+ T cells using anti-CD8α antibody (Fig
3B). NK cells provide another early pathway of IFN-γ production in response to T. gondii
infection [94]. However, depletion of this cell population using anti-NK1.1 antibody did not
affect the antitumor response (S3A Fig).
Depletion of CD4+ T cells using anti-CD4 antibody also abrogated the antitumor response
(Fig 3C). Moreover, consistent with a requirement for CD4+ T cells, major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) II was also required for stimulation of the antitumor response (S3B Fig). Sur-
prisingly, MHCII played a dichotomous role. The absence of MHCII in normal (nontumor)
cells delayed development of the ID8DV tumor, suggesting that MHCII may also act to pro-
mote ovarian tumor development (S3B Fig). Together these results suggested that CD8+ T
cells, CD4+ T cells, and MHCII were essential to drive IFN-γ production and antitumor
immunity.
Live invasive parasites are required for stimulation of the IL-12/IFN-γ
TH1 axis
To examine whether active invasion of host cells was essential to the antitumor response, we
heat killed uracil auxotrophs at 56°C to abolish their ability to invade host cells (S4A Fig). Heat
killed uracil auxotrophs exhibited no detectable antitumor response (Fig 4A). However, we

 could not exclude the possibility that heat treatment reduced the activity of parasite molecules
that would otherwise stimulate IL-12 production, since heat treatment of T. gondii has been
previously shown to elicit a reduced IL-12 response in comparison to live parasites [95]. To
address this, we prepared, tachyzoite excreted/secreted antigen (ESA) extracts, tachyzoite
lysate antigen (TLA) extracts, and soluble tachyzoite antigen (STAg) extracts from uracil auxo-
trophs to examine whether parasite extracts not subjected to heat treatment could promote the
antitumor response. ESA, TLA, and STAg extracts exhibited no detectable antitumor activity
(Fig 4B).
We hypothesized that while heat killed uracil auxotrophs could stimulate IL-12, the activa-
tion of the IL-12/IFN-γ TH1 axis may be incomplete. To examine this, highly immunosuppres-
sive ID8DV tumors were established in mice for 25 days and vaccinated once with live uracil
auxotrophs or heat killed uracil auxotrophs. Supernatants from the peritoneal ovarian tumor
microenvironment were analyzed for IL-12, type I and type II interferons, and inflammasome
activation 18 and 66 h post-vaccination. Increased production of IL-12p40 and IL-12p70 was
observed 18 h following treatment with heat killed parasites but this early IL-12 subsided by 66
h (Fig 4C and 4D). As expected, higher levels of IL-12 were observed 18 h after vaccination
with live uracil auxotrophs, and this response persisted for at least 66 h (Fig 4C and 4D).
Live invasive uracil auxotrophs elicited a slight increase in IFN-γ as early as 18 h, however,
IFN-γ levels were markedly increased by 66 h (Fig 4E). In contrast, noninvasive heat killed par-
asites failed to stimulate any detectable increase in the production of IFN-γ in the immunosup-
pressive ID8DV tumor microenvironment (Fig 4E). In addition, type I interferon alpha (IFN-

 vaccination, a low level increase in IL-1α was observed at 66 h after therapeutic vaccination
with live invasive uracil auxotrophs (S4C Fig).
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are the major producers of IFN-γ in T. gondii infection [39], and
IFN-γ is the key inflammatory cytokine that activates the major mechanism of IRG-dependent
innate immunity that effectively clears intracellular parasites and PVs [63]. Preferential inva-
sion of CD11c+ antigen presenting cells by uracil auxotrophs was previously associated with
the initiation of the T cell dependent antitumor response that targets ID8DV ovarian tumors
[16]. The requirement of live invasive parasites to induce IFN-γ (Fig 4E) suggested that persis-
tence of parasites in invaded host cells could be essential to drive the antitumor response. On
the other hand, IFN-γ could also rapidly clear parasites from invaded cells through host IRGs
and innate immunity. Type I uracil auxotrophs were recently shown to fully resist PV clearance
in IFN-γ activated macrophages in vitro for at least 5 days [4]. We examined clearance of YFP+
uracil auxotrophs from invaded CD11c+ cells in the ID8DV tumor microenvironment and
observed a 16.8-fold and 12.9-fold reduction in the absolute number or percentage, respec-
tively, of YFP+CD11c+ antigen presenting cells between 18 h and 66 h after therapeutic vacci-
nation (Fig 4F). In addition, previous studies have shown that uracil auxotrophs remain in the
peritoneum after vaccination and parasite invaded myeloid cells were found to rarely migrate
to draining lymph nodes in either naive mice [4] or in tumor-bearing mice [19]. These results
suggest that uracil auxotroph PVs in CD11c+ cells were not cleared prior to 18 h but were rap-
idly cleared between 18 and 66 h, potentially through an IFN-γ dependent mechanism.
Active invasion and injection of parasite secreted molecules into host
cells trigger potent antitumor responses
In view that live invasive uracil auxotrophs were associated with the potent antitumor response,
we explored whether invasion and/or rhoptry secretion was required for this response. To inves-
tigate rhoptry secretion, uracil auxotrophs were treated with the chemical 4-bromophenacyl bro-
mide (4BPB). 4BPB selectively inhibits phospholipase A2 to irreversibly block rhoptry secretion
and parasite invasion of host cells (S5 Fig) without affecting parasite attachment to host cells
[97–99]. 4BPB treatment of uracil auxotrophs completely abrogated the antitumor response (Fig
5), suggesting that rhoptry secretion was essential for this response.
Toxoplasma directly injects rhoptry effector molecules into host cells prior to invasion as
well as into contacted but noninvaded bystander cells [26–28]. To differentiate the role of
rhoptry secretion into host cells with or without parasite invasion and PVM formation in the

established in C57BL/6 mice and groups of mice were treated with PBS, or were vaccinated i.p. with 4BPB
treated, mycalolide B treated, or untreated tachyzoites of uracil auxotrophs (OMP) using the standard three-
dose treatment schedule. Data is representative of three independent experiments. ns was not significant,

 host cell, we treated uracil auxotrophs with the chemical mycalolide B, a compound that irre-
versibly blocks parasite motility thereby inhibiting invasion of host cells without blocking
rhoptry secretion [100,101]. As expected, mycalolide B treated uracil auxotrophs were blocked
in their invasion of host cells (S5 Fig). Mycalolide B treated uracil auxotrophs were markedly
weakened in their ability to trigger the antitumor response (Fig 5). Together these chemical
inhibition experiments suggested that rhoptry secretion as well as active invasion of host cells
was necessary to arm the full antitumor response.
Parasite secreted molecules derived from rhoptry and dense granules
trigger the antitumor response
Based on the requirements for active invasion and parasite secretion, we hypothesized that spe-
cific ROP and GRA secreted effector proteins may control the antitumor response. To identify
whether specific secreted effector molecules were involved in the antitumor response we used a
reverse genetic approach to target complete gene deletions of selected candidate parasite ROP
or GRA genes using the Δku80ΔompdcΔupΔhxgprt OMP uracil auxotroph vaccine background
as the parental strain (Table 1). Targeted gene deletions were engineered using positive genetic
selection to replace genes of interest (GOI) with the HXGPRT selectable marker [102] at the
targeted gene loci (S6 Fig) [13,14,92,103,104].
We targeted the deletion of predicted active ROP kinases ROP21, ROP35 and ROP38. The
deletion of ROP35 or ROP38 in the less virulent type II background was recently shown to

 abrogate latent infection without affecting parasite virulence during acute infection [75].
ROP35 and ROP38 are differentially expressed (>16 fold) between parasite strains and overex-
pression of ROP38 down regulates transcription of many host genes involved in proliferation,
MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling, and apoptosis [78]. Deletion of ROP21 (OMPΔrop21) did not
affect the antitumor response (Fig 6A). In contrast, deletion of the ROP38 gene locus (OMP-
Δrop38) as well as ROP35 (OMPΔrop35) markedly impaired the antitumor response (Fig 6A).
The ROP35 deleted uracil auxotroph (OMPΔrop35) was complemented with the wild-type
ROP35 allele to generate strain OMPΔrop35::ROP35 by targeted insertion of ROP35 (C-termi-
nal HA tagged) along with the cytosine deaminase gene into the OMPDC locus, and the com-
plemented strain was selected by growth in cytosine which is converted to uracil by cytosine
deaminase (CD) (S7 Fig) [105]. Importantly, the CD gene provides a new genetic marker for
positive selection, which can be used specifically in uracil auxotrophic backgrounds without
affecting parasite virulence. In addition, the CD marker can also be deployed as a genetic
marker for negative selection by selection with the nontoxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine [105].
Complementation of the ROP35 deletion by expression of a HA-tagged allele of ROP35 (OMP-
Δrop35::ROP35) (Fig 6A) rescued the antitumor response (Fig 6A). Complementation of

 OMPΔrop38 was not currently feasible due to the existence of multiple related ROP38 alleles in
the ROP38 gene locus and the absence of any complete cosmid, fosmid, or BAC that spans this
gene locus (ToxoDB.org) [75].
ROP21 and ROP38 were previously shown to localize to the PVM following their injection into
host cells [78], however, the localization of ROP35 has not been reported. To determine whether
ROP35 is also localized to the PVM after its injection into the host cell we used digitonin selective
permeable conditions to expose the cytosolic face of the PVM [59,62] and found that ROP35 was
localized to the PVM (Fig 6C). These data suggest that specific parasite secreted ROP effectors asso-
ciated with the PVM and host transcriptional manipulation, but not specifically associated with
parasite virulence, were involved in the mechanism that triggers the antitumor response.
Shortly after host cell invasion parasite dense granules massively secrete a large repertoire of
proteins into the PV lumen and a subset of dense granule proteins including GRA2 [106] and
GRA12 [107] establish association with an intravacuolar network (IVN) of nanotubular mem-
branes. Deletion of IVN associated GRA proteins GRA2 (OMPΔgra2) or GRA12 (OMPΔ-
gra12) markedly impaired the antitumor response (Fig 6D). In contrast, deletion of PVM
associated GRA3 (OMPΔgra3) did not affect the antitumor response (S8A Fig). Other GRA
proteins such as GRA16 and GRA24 are secreted past the PVM to the host cell nucleus [80].
GRA24 deletion (OMPΔgra24) markedly impaired the antitumor response (Fig 6D). In con-
trast, deletion of GRA16 (OMPΔgra16), a secreted effector molecule that targets to the host
nucleus and modulates host p53 and cell cycle [79], did not affect the antitumor response (S8A
Fig). In addition, deletion of GRA15 (OMPΔgra15) or ROP16 (OMPΔrop16) did not affect the
antitumor response (S8B Fig). Since GRA15 and ROP16 were previously shown to modulate
various host transcriptional pathways [86,108,109], we also developed a double-targeted dele-
tion of ROP16 and GRA15 (OMPΔgra15Δrop16). The OMPΔgra15Δrop16 double mutant also
exhibited a normal antitumor response (S8B Fig). Thus certain parasite secreted effector mole-
cules that manipulate IL-12 (ROP16, GRA15) or that associate with the PVM (GRA3, ROP21)
did not influence the antitumor response. In contrast, PVM associated ROP proteins ROP35
and ROP38, IVN-associated GRA proteins GRA2 and GRA12, as well as host nucleus-associ-
ated GRA24 were essential to the mechanism that triggers potent antitumor immunity.
Parasite secreted PVM associated rhoptry molecules ROP5, ROP17,
and ROP18 trigger the antitumor response
Since GRA2 was previously suggested to play a role in reducing association of IRGs to the
PVM [66], we assessed whether other parasite molecules involved in resistance to IRGs were
necessary to trigger the antitumor response. PVM associated protein complexes containing
ROP5, ROP17, or ROP18 molecules resist host IRGs [62]. Deletion of ROP5 (OMPΔrop5) or
ROP18 (OMPΔrop18) markedly impaired the antitumor response in comparison to parental
OMP, or to ROP17 deletion (OMPΔrop17), although ROP17 deletion itself also slightly
impaired antitumor response (Fig 7A). This profile was consistent with a potential role for IRG
resistance in mediating the antitumor response.
We assessed the resistance of the type I uracil auxotroph mutants to IRGs in IFN-γ stimu-
lated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The OMPΔrop5 and OMPΔrop18 mutants, as
expected, were markedly impaired in their survival in IFN-γ-activated MEFs (Fig 7B). Also as
expected, the OMPΔrop17 mutant exhibited only a minor defect in IRG resistance and survival.
However, other uracil auxotrophic mutants (OMPΔrop35, OMPΔrop38, OMPΔgra2, OMPΔ-
gra12, OMPΔgra24) that exhibited major defects in triggering the antitumor response fully
resisted IRG mediated killing in IFN-γ activated MEFs (Fig 7B). Moreover, these uracil auxo-
trophic mutants did not exhibit any defects in their invasion of host cells (Fig 7C). In

 comparison, uracil auxotrophic mutants that exhibited no defects in their antitumor response
retained their normal ability to resist IRG killing in IFN-γ stimulated MEFs (S9 Fig). Together,
these results suggested that while ROP5, ROP17, and ROP18 functions were important for the
antitumor response, resistance to IRGs did not appear to be specifically associated with the
antitumor response.
Through genetic crosses, type I ROP5 has been previously associated with markedly
increased virulence, whereas type II ROP5 was proposed to be avirulent [61,69]. Consistent
with these findings, previous experiments have shown that the expression of virulent type I
ROP5 in the less virulent type II strain increased parasite virulence by ~3 to 4-logs [66], and
that type II T. gondii strains poorly resisted IRG killing mechanisms in IFN-γ activated cells
[44]. We recently reported that the genetic deletion of ROP5 or ROP18 in the less virulent type
II strain reduced parasite virulence by ~ 2-logs and correspondingly reduced resistance to kill-
ing by host IRGs in IFN-γ stimulated MEFs by ~10% [75]. To further assess the relationship of
the antitumor response and IRG resistance we examined a type II uracil auxotroph (type II
OMP) [14] as well as attenuated type II mutants lacking genes for ROP5 or ROP18 [75]. Type

 II OMP [14] (Table 1) elicited indistinguishable antitumor responses in comparison to type I
OMP (Fig 7D). In addition, the deletion of ROP5 or ROP18 in the type II background
markedly impaired the antitumor response (Fig 7D).
PVM association is essential but the ROP18 kinase activity is
dispensable for triggering the antitumor response
To further examine the role of resistance to IRG killing mechanisms from other potential
mechanisms we focused on the active ROP18 kinase that directly phosphorylates IRG effectors
to inactivate host innate immunity [63]. We complemented the ROP18 deleted OMPΔrop18
strain by expression of wild-type (OMPΔrop18::ROP18) or various mutant C-terminally HA-
tagged ROP18 alleles, (OMPΔrop18::ROP18KD, OMPΔrop18::ROP18RAH2(ATF), or the double
mutant OMPΔrop18::ROP18RAH2(ATF),KD) (S10A Fig) via targeted insertion of the ROP18 gene
along with the cytosine deaminase gene into the OMPDC locus through positive selection in
cytosine (S7 Fig). Complementation of OMPΔrop18 with C-terminal HA-tagged wild-type
ROP18 (OMPΔrop18::ROP18) rescued the antitumor response (Fig 8A). Remarkably, comple-
mentation of OMPΔrop18 with C-terminal HA-tagged kinase-dead (KD) ROP18 (OMP-
Δrop18::ROP18KD) [63] also rescued the antitumor response (Fig 8A), suggesting that the
ROP18 virulence function mediated by the ROP18 kinase activity was not essential for the anti-
tumor response.
The ROP18 ATF6β association domain is identical to the second arginine rich amphipathic
helix (RAH2) domain of ROP18 that targets ROP18 to the PVM after its injection into host cells
[64,110]. While active wild-type ROP18 as well as kinase-dead ROP18 fully rescued the antitumor
response, complementation of OMPΔrop18 with C-terminal HA-tagged RAH2(ATF) deficient
alleles (designated as RAH2(ATF) [75]) of ROP18 (OMPΔrop18::ROP18RAH2(ATF) or the double
mutant OMPΔrop18::ROP18RAH2(ATF),KD failed to rescue the antitumor response (Fig 8A).
Previous studies have shown that ectopic expression of ROP18 kinase activity in the absence
of infection and PVM formation mediated the degradation of host NF-κβ [76] as well as host
ATF6β [77]. In addition to ROP18 kinase activity, ROP18 PVM association is also required for
resistance to host IRGs and virulence [63,64]. Therefore, we measured the resistance of mutant
ROP18 uracil auxotrophs to IRGs and PV killing. The wild-type allele of ROP18 fully rescued
resistance to IRG killing in the ROP18 deficient strain, however, the kinase-dead as well as
RAH2(ATF) domain deleted ROP18 alleles, as expected, failed to rescue any detectable resis-
tance to IRG killing (Fig 8B). These results were corroborated in ex vivo experiments using
IFN-γ stimulated bone marrow derived macrophages. The RAH2(ATF) domain deleted and
the kinase-dead ROP18 alleles failed to confer resistance to host IRGs in IFN-γ stimulated mac-
rophages, whereas the wild-type ROP18 allele was resistant to PV killing (S10B Fig). In addi-
tion, the type II OMP uracil auxotroph that elicits a potent antitumor response
indistinguishable from type I OMP (Fig 7D), as expected, was exquisitely susceptible to IRG
mediated killing in comparison to type I OMP (Fig 8B).
To further assess the requirement for the association of ROP18 with the PVM to trigger the
antitumor response, we localized wild-type ROP18 as well as the kinase-dead ROP18 to the
cytosolic surface of newly formed PVs using digitonin selective permeable conditions (Fig 8C).
In contrast, deletion of the RAH2(ATF) domain, as expected, completely abolished the associa-
tion of ROP18 with the PVM after its injection into host cells (Fig 8C). These data suggested
that the antitumor response was not dependent on the ROP18 kinase activity but did require
ROP18 PVM association.
We next asked whether injection of ROP18 into bystander host cells in the absence of inva-
sion could trigger the antitumor response. To address this question we compared the

 antitumor efficacy of vaccinations using the ROP18 deleted OMP strain (OMPΔrop18) com-
pared to mycalolide B treatment of this strain. A significant increase in resistance to tumor
development was observed in ROP18 deficient OMP parasites compared to mycalolide B
treated ROP18 deficient OMP parasites (Fig 8D). However, no significant difference in the
antitumor response was observed between mycalolide B treated OMP compared to mycalolide
B treated ROP18 deficient OMP parasites (Fig 8D). These results suggest that ROP18 kinase
activity in the absence of PVM association did not trigger the antitumor response.
Discussion
Our studies extend the application of reverse genetic engineering in Toxoplasma gondii by
using a genetically tractable Δku80 uracil auxotrophic vaccine background to reliably generate
parasite strains with precisely targeted gene deletions of secreted parasite effectors. Targeted

 deletions of specific rhoptry and dense granule proteins in isogenic uracil auxotrophic back-
grounds enabled a comparable measurement of the functional contribution of each of these
secreted effectors in triggering the antitumor response to ID8DV ovarian tumors. These
genetic studies revealed key roles for ROP5, ROP17, ROP18, ROP35, ROP38, GRA2, GRA12,
and GRA24 secreted parasite effectors in triggering the antitumor response.
Host cell invasion by T. gondii requires motility and secretion from apical organelles [111].
Chemical treatment of T. gondii with 4-bromophenacyl bromide (4BPB) irreversibly inhibits
rhoptry secretion and invasion [97–99]. The antitumor response was absent in 4BPB treated
uracil auxotrophs. Mycalolide B treated parasites fail to invade host cells due to a motility
defect but can still secrete from their rhoptry organelles [100,101]. Our mycalolide B inhibition
experiments suggested that rhoptry secretion in the absence of host cell invasion provided a
detectable, though suboptimal, antitumor response. However, this antitumor response was
markedly increased through a sequential combination of rhoptry secretion, host cell invasion,
and the formation of the PV and PVM. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that secreted
GRA proteins and PVM associated ROP proteins trigger a potent antitumor response from
within invaded host cells in the tumor microenvironment.
Therapeutic vaccination of solid tumors with uracil auxotrophs converts tolerogenic tumor
microenvironments into immune stimulatory microenvironments in aggressive models of
murine pancreatic cancer, melanoma, and ovarian cancer through the stimulation of tumor-
specific CD8+ T cell populations [15,16,19]. Induction of the antitumor response in primary
tumors did not require CD4+ T cell populations in B16 melanoma [15] or disseminated pan-
creatic tumors [19], although in treated mice that survived the primary cancer, CD4+ T cells
were shown to play an important role in enforcing immunity to pancreatic cancer [20]. Our
data suggests that in addition to CD8+ T cells [16,17], MHCII and CD4+ T cells were also nec-
essary to mediate the antitumor response induced by uracil auxotrophs to ID8DV ovarian
tumors.
Uracil auxotrophic mutants were previously shown to preferentially target and invade
CD11c+ antigen presenting cells in the ID8DV tumor microenvironment [16]. Our findings
show that heat killed uracil auxotrophs failed to elicit an antitumor response. In addition, non-
invasive heat killed uracil auxotrophs induced early IL-12 but, surprisingly, did not stimulate
IFN-γ in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting that T cell populations were not highly acti-
vated in the absence of parasite invasion. Parasite extracts also failed to elicit any detectable
antitumor response, reinforcing the importance of parasite invasion as a key step in the antitu-
mor mechanism. Live invasive parasites rapidly induced high levels of IL-12 followed shortly
thereafter by high-level production of IFN-γ. Moreover, high IFN-γ levels present after thera-
peutic vaccination with live parasites were associated with the effective clearance of intracellu-
lar uracil auxotrophs in the parasite invaded CD11c+ cell population within 66 h. Collectively,
these findings indicate that parasite invasion of CD11c+ antigen presenting cells rapidly trig-
gered the antitumor response through IFN-γ producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations.
High-level expression of IL-12 is triggered in CD8α+ dendritic cells by MyD88 dependent
signaling downstream of TLR11/12 dependent recognition of parasite profilin [37,38,89]. How-
ever, uracil auxotroph vaccination of MyD88 knockout (MyD88-/-) mice was previously shown
to elicit a reduced IL-12 response that was sufficient to drive IFN-γ production by protective T
cell populations [10]. Our findings revealed that the antitumor response was intact in MyD88-/-
mice, suggesting that the primary MyD88 dependent pathway for high level IL-12 production
by CD8α+ dendritic cells was not strictly required. However, mice completely deficient in
CD8α+ dendritic cells (Batf3-/- or IRF8-/- knockout mice) do not produce protective IL-12 or
IFN-γ and rapidly succumb to T. gondii infection [36,112], and our experiments (present
work) revealed that CD8α+ dendritic cell deficiency in Batf3-/- knockout mice abrogated the

 antitumor response. These findings establish the essentiality of the CD11c+ CD8α+ dendritic
cell in the antitumor response elicited by live uracil auxotrophs.
CD11c+ CD8α+ dendritic cells have been recognized play an important role in cross presen-
tation of antigens to prime CD8+ T cell mediated immunity to tumors [113]. We have previ-
ously shown that the invasion of ID8DV tumor associated immune suppressed CD11c+
antigen presenting cells by uracil auxotrophs triggered the expression of the T-cell receptor
costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 [16,17]. Invasion of CD11c+ antigen presenting cells
by uracil auxotrophs also increased CD80 and CD86 expression in melanoma and pancreatic
cancer tumor microenvironments [15,19], and uracil auxotroph invasion of dendritic cells in
naive mice increased the expression of CD80 and CD86 as well as MHCI that is required to ini-
tiate antigen presentation that drives the development of protective T cell populations [4]. The
high level induction of CD86 by T. gondii was previously shown to require active parasite inva-
sion and host cell signaling through the JNK pathway [114]. Consistent with increased antigen
presentation by uracil auxotroph invaded CD11c+ cells, antigen presenting cells harvested 18 h
after uracil auxotroph vaccination of the ID8DV ovarian tumor microenvironment were previ-
ously shown to have regained a substantial ability to present the ovalbumin (OVA OT-I) pep-
tide on MHCI for recognition by OVA-specific CD8+ T cells [16]. These findings showed that
uracil auxotrophs reversed immune suppression in CD11c+ antigen presenting cells in the
immune suppressed ID8DV tumor microenvironment [16–18]. The constitutive activation of
the host unfolded protein response ER stress pathway mediated by XBP-1 in ID8DV ovarian
tumor associated dendritic cells was recently shown to be a central immunosuppressive mecha-
nism that promotes ovarian cancer progression by dampening antigen presentation [115].
Moreover, targeted deletion or inactivation of XBP-1 to quench the unfolded protein response
to stress was demonstrated to restore the immunostimulatory activity of ID8DV tumor associ-
ated CD11c+ dendritic cells and promoted the development of antitumor CD8+ T cell popula-
tions [115]. T. gondii has been shown to manipulate the unfolded protein response through
ATF6β [77]. These findings suggest that additional studies are necessary to further address
whether the antitumor mechanism elicited by uracil auxotrophs targets host cell stress
pathways.
We used recently engineered Δku80 genetic models [92,103] to target parasite gene deletions
to identify secreted parasite molecules that were required for the antitumor response. PVM
associated ROP5/ROP17/ROP18 parasite effector molecules play a central role in mediating
the antitumor response. In virulent type I parasite strains, ROP5 associates in high molecular
weight complexes with either ROP17 or ROP18 to mediate IRG resistance and virulence mech-
anisms [61–63,69]. The kinase activity of ROP17 [62] as well as ROP18 [63] is required for
IRG resistance and parasite virulence. In addition to kinase activity, PVM association of the
ROP5/ROP17/ROP18 complexes has been shown to be essential for IRG resistance and para-
site virulence [62–64]. Our findings show that while PVM association of ROP18 was essential
to trigger the antitumor response, the ROP18 kinase activity was not required for this response.
Since deletion of ROP5 also abrogated the antitumor response, it seems likely that the antitu-
mor mechanism is mediated through the ROP5/ROP18 PVM complex. In addition to IRG
resistance, the kinase activity of ectopically expressed ROP18 in the absence of invasion and
the PVM has been previously shown to mediate the degradation of the host NF-κβ p65 subunit
[76] as well as the host ER stress sensor ATF6β [77]. It remains to be determined whether a
PVM associated kinase inactive ROP18 could associate with host ATF6β. In addition to previ-
ously recognized associations of ROP18 with host IRGs, host NF-κβ [76], and ATF6β [77],
ROP18 was previously shown in yeast two-hybrid assays to associate with additional host cell
proteins [116,117]. Further studies would be necessary to decipher whether the interaction of
ROP18 with any of these host proteins triggers the antitumor mechanism.

 Our studies show that PVM associated ROP35 and ROP38 molecules were also essential to
the antitumor response. The function of ROP35 is poorly understood although this molecule,
like ROP38, exhibits strain type specific variation in mRNA expression levels [78]. ROP38 has
been previously shown to modulate the expression level of a large number of host genes
involved in MAPK signaling cascades, apoptosis, and host cell proliferation [78]. In addition,
the ROP38 gene locus [78] as well as ROP35, were recently shown to mediate the parasites abil-
ity to establish latent infection through a mechanism that did not affect parasite virulence [75].
In addition, ROP35 and ROP38 molecules were not identified in ROP5/ROP17/ROP18 associ-
ated protein complexes [62]. These data suggest that the ROP35 and ROP38 antitumor mecha-
nisms most likely function independently of the ROP5/ROP17/ROP18 complexes. Additional
studies are thus essential to decipher the ROP35 and ROP38 antitumor mechanisms.
We identified GRA24 (also known as TgBRADIN [118]) as a secreted dense granule mole-
cule that was crucial to trigger the antitumor response. GRA24 was previously shown to traffic
past the PVM to the host cell nucleus and this effector molecule functions to sustain the activa-
tion of host cell p38α MAPK by both type I and type II parasite strains [87]. In addition, host
cell modulation of IL-12 by GRA24 was previously shown to be parasite strain type dependent
and while GRA24 in type II strains stimulated IL-12 production, GRA24 in type I strains did
not [87]. Our results show that type I and type II uracil auxotrophs elicited equally potent anti-
tumor responses. These findings suggest that the GRA24 antitumor mechanism is potentially
associated with p38α MAPK signaling.
The secreted GRA15 molecule was previously shown to elicit IL-12 in type II strain infection
but not during infection by type I strains [86,100,109]. Type II GRA15 increased host cell IL-12
production through strain type dependent manipulation of host NF-κβ signaling [86,100]. In
contrast, type I ROP16, but not type II ROP16, has been shown to suppress IL-12 production
[83,109]. Our experiments revealed that neither GRA15 or ROP16 were essential for the antitu-
mor response. GRA15 and ROP16 effectors have been previously identified as key molecules
that underpin the induction of the M2 phenotype in macrophages polarized by infection with
type I parasites, whereas these secreted molecules were associated with the induction of the
classical activation M1-like phenotype in macrophages polarized by infection with type II para-
sites [109,119]. In contrast, we previously reported that type I uracil auxotrophs induced a
unique profile of macrophage polarization exhibiting features of both the M1 as well as the M2
polarized phenotypes [120]. In addition, vaccination with nonreplicating type I uracil auxo-
trophs quickly elicited IL-12 in naive mice [7] as well as after therapeutic vaccination of estab-
lished tumor microenvironments (present work) [15,16,19]. In contrast, infection with virulent
type I strains was previously shown to suppress the early production of IL-12 [121]. Together
these findings suggest that parasite strain type dependent host cell modulation by certain para-
site secreted effectors after vaccination by nonreplicating uracil auxotrophs is mechanistically
distinct from host modulation that occurs following infection by replicating parasite strains.
Further studies are therefore necessary to understand how, in the absence of parasite replica-
tion, secreted effectors that are known to be associated with virulence function to trigger antitu-
mor immunity.
In addition to secreted rhoptry effectors and the host nucleus targeted GRA24, we identified
an important role for IVN associated dense granule proteins GRA2 and GRA12 in the antitu-
mor response. Deletion of GRA2 was previously shown to increase IRG coating of the PVM
[66], to slightly reduce parasite virulence [122], to modulate the presentation of PV membrane
bound or soluble PV lumen antigens by MHCI in parasite invaded macrophages and dendritic
cells [123], and to also induce a morphological loss of the appearance of the IVN within the PV
luminal spaces without affecting the association of host ER and mitochondria with the PVM
[106]. The morphology and dynamic membranes of the IVN are poorly characterized,

 however, recent helium ion microscopy studies have suggested that IVN structures can extend
from the surface of the tachyzoite stage parasite in the PV directly to IVN junctions on the PV
lumen side of the PVM [124]. Our findings suggest that the role of GRA2 in formation of the
IVN [106,123] was essential for the antitumor response. In addition, GRA2 deletion was
recently shown to reduce parasite heterophagy, a parasite process that ingests host cell cyto-
plasm into the lumen of the PV [125]. While the heterophagy mechanism has not yet been pre-
cisely determined, it is highly likely that this process involves the PVM, which serves as a
membrane barrier between the PV lumen and the host cell cytoplasm. One previously pro-
posed model of the PVM has suggested that invaginations of the PVM could develop into
PVM tubules that extend into the PV luminal space [110]. This model hypothesized that these
tubular network structures may preferentially attract molecules from the cytosolic face of the
PVM that have an affinity for high negative curvature, and then retain these PVM molecules
through potential binding partners associated with IVN tubular membranes [110]. While the
function of GRA12 is currently unknown, like GRA2, this molecule also localizes to the IVN
structures in the PV space [107]. Remarkably, GRA12 was previously shown to associate spe-
cifically with the ROP5/ROP18 complexes that assemble on the PVM [62]. Collectively, these
findings suggest that the antitumor mechanism depends on maintenance of dynamic interac-
tions between the IVN and the PVM. Further studies of the parasite IVN and PVM would be
necessary to identify the specific mechanisms that underpin the antitumor response mediated by
the IVN associated GRA2 and GRA12 dense granule secreted molecules. Our results argue that
secretion of rhoptry effector proteins, host cell invasion, formation of the PV, secretion of specific
GRA effector proteins to the IVN structures present in the PV lumen, and the export of GRA
protein(s) past the PVM to the host cell nucleus coordinately triggers the potent ID8DV antitu-
mor immune response elicited by nonreplicating uracil auxotroph mutants of T. gondii.

 (FBS) (Invitrogen) and Penicillin and Streptomycin (Corning) (final concentration 100 units/ml
Penicillin and 100 μg/ml Streptomycin. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were cultured in
Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM) (Lonza) in 10% FBS and Antimycotic-Antibiotic
(Gibco) (final concentration 100 units/ml Penicillin,100 μg/ml Streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml Fun-
gizone). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in the C57BL/6 background were obtained from
the ATCC and were cultured in DMEM in 15% FBS and Penicillin and Streptomycin.
Parasites
Toxoplasma gondii was maintained by serial passage of tachyzoites in HFF monolayers cul-
tured in EMEM containing 1% FBS, (2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml
streptomycin) as previously described [7]. Uracil auxotrophs were supplemented with 0.2 mM
uracil (Sigma-Aldrich). OMP [13], CPS [5], CPS-YFP [96], and other strains used for treat-
ment of ID8DV tumors were cultured in HFF monolayers and freshly lysed extracellular tachy-
zoites were purified by filtration through 3.0 μm filters (Nuclepore), and washed extensively in
Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) prior to intraperitoneal injection in 0.2 ml PBS in
ID8DV ovarian tumor-bearing mice.
Xenograft model of ovarian carcinoma
Aggressive disseminated ovarian tumors were established in mice by intraperitoneal injection of 2
X 106 ID8DV tumor cells [90]. Independent samples of identical ID8DV stocks were used for all
experiments. Intraperitoneal treatment of established ID8DV tumors with uracil auxotrophs was
performed using 2 x 106 tachyzoites in a one-dose (25 d), two-dose (8, 20 d), three-dose (8, 20, 32
d), or five-dose (8, 20, 32, 44, 56 d) schedule after ID8DV tumor challenge. Each preparation of
tachyzoites was subjected to a plaque forming unit (PFU) assay to measure parasite viability and
verify treatment dose. Tumor-bearing mice were monitored for wellness and tumor development.
Parasite survival assays
Parasite survival was measured in MEFs that were pre-stimulated for 24 h with murine IFN-γ
(Peprotech) (final concentration of 100 units/ml). Triplicate MEF monolayers that were stimu-
lated or not stimulated with IFN-γ in 24 well culture plates were infected with 100–200 PFU of
each parasite strain and incubated for 6 days at 37°C. All PFU in each culture was scored using
light microscopy and survival percentage was calculated as the number of PFU in IFN-γ stimu-
lated MEFs divided by the number of PFU scored in nonstimulated MEFs (no IFN-γ treat-
ment). Survival assays of parasite strains were performed in at least three independent
experiments for each strain examined. C57BL/6 bone marrow derived macrophages were dif-
ferentiated as previously described, and 4 x 106 macrophages were seeded in 6-well trays over-
night. Macrophages were pre-stimulated, or not stimulated, for 6 h with IFN-γ (100 U/ml,
Preprotech) and TNF alpha (TNF-α) (10 U/ml, Preprotech) then cultures were infected with ~
100 tachyzoites per well and cultures were incubated for 6 days to develop PFU. Cultures were
stained with coomassie brilliant blue to identify PFU. Survival percentage was calculated as the
number of PFU in IFN-γ stimulated macrophages divided by the number of PFU scored in
nonstimulated macrophages. Survival assays of parasite strains were performed in at least two
independent experiments for each strain examined.
Replication and invasion assays
The intracellular growth rate of parasite strains was measured in HFF cells in a 30 h growth
assay using previously described methods [5]. Briefly, HFF monolayers were infection at a

 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of ~0.1. After 1 h of invasion the noninvaded parasites were
removed by extensive (4X) washing in PBS and the number of parasites per vacuole was scored
30 h later from at least 50 vacuoles per sample. The relative rate of invasion of mutant strains
was measured in MEFs in comparison to parental OMP. Two hundred tachyzoites of tested
strains were added in triplicate to each monolayer of MEF cells in 24 well trays and allowed to
invaded for 3 h. Noninvaded parasites were removed by extensive washing in PBS and the
number of PFU per well was scored 6–7 days later by microscopy. Experiments were repeated
in at least four independent assays.
Heat killed parasites and extracts
Uracil auxotroph tachyzoites were filtered through 3 μm nuclepore membranes and washed
extensively in PBS. Tachyzoites were heat killed at 56°C for 15 minutes as previously described
[126]. Excreted-secreted antigen (ESA) extracts were prepared by incubation of 2 x 108 tachy-
zoites for 3 h at 37°C in EMEM supplemented with 10% FBS followed by removal of tachy-
zoites by centrifugation at 1200g for 7 minutes as previously described [127]. Total
Toxoplasma lysate antigen (TLA) extracts were prepared by sonication of tachyzoites on ice.
Complete loss of viability was verified in PFU assays. Soluble tachyzoite antigen (STAg)
extracts were prepared by high-speed centrifugation of TLA as previously described [39]. Para-
site extracts were stored at -80°C. For each treatment, ID8DV tumor-bearing mice received the
equivalent of 5 x 106 tachyzoites of ESA, TLA, or STAg extracts.
Chemical inhibition
Tachyzoites were purified using 3.0 μm Nuclepore filters, concentrated by centrifugation at
1000g and washed extensively in PBS. Tachyzoites (2 x 107/ml) were treated with 100 μM
4-bromophenylacyl bromide (4BPB) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at 37°C and quenched with
20 volumes of complete media and washed in PBS [126]. Tachyzoites (2 x 107/ml) in PBS were
treated with 3 μM mycalolide B (Wako) for 15 min at 37°C and quenched with 20 volumes of
complete media and washed in PBS [100,101]. Parasite inactivation of invasion was verified in
PFU assays.
Antibody depletions
Purified monoclonal antibodies αCD8 (2.43), αCD4 (GK1.5), and isotype control Rat IgG2a
were purchased from BioXcell. For cell depletions, 500 μg of antibody was administered by
intraperitoneal injection 1 day prior to and 250 μg of antibody was administered by intraperito-
neal injection 0 and 3 d after each treatment with uracil auxotrophs. NK cells were depleted
using αNK1.1 (PK136) antibody (a generous gift from Dr. Charles Sentman at Dartmouth,
EBioscience), and intraperitoneal injections of 50 μg of αNK1.1 antibody were given on day -1,
0, and +3 relative to each treatment with uracil auxotrophs [19]. In all experiments target cell
populations were depleted by greater than 98%.
Cytokine assays
Peritoneal fluid obtained by peritoneal lavage using 5 ml PBS [16] was used for the detection of
cytokines in the ovarian tumor microenvironment. IL-12p40 and IL-12p70 were determined
using duplex luminex assays (Millipore). IFN-γ, IL-1α and IL-1β were measured using a mouse
32-plex Luminex assay (Millipore). Type I interferons were measured using a mouse IFN alpha
and IFN beta 2Plex assay (EBioscience).

 Primers and PCR
T. gondii genomic DNA was purified from tachyzoites using the DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen)
on a robotic Qiacube (Qiagen). PCR products for targeting vector construction were amplified
from primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) using High Fidelity polymerases (Roche). The
Toxoplasma genome resource (www.toxodb.org) [128] was used to identify gene loci of interest
and sequences to design oligonucleotide primers.
Gene knockouts
Targeted ROP and GRA knockouts were generated in the OMP parental uracil auxotroph
strain RHΔku80ΔompdcΔupΔhxgprt which was generated by the deletion of HXGPRT select-
able marker from the uridine phosphorylase of OMP (strain RHΔku80ΔompdcΔup::HXGPRT)
locus using 6-thioxanthine (250 μg/ml) (Acros Biochemicals) and uracil selection as previously
described [13]. ROP and GRA gene targeting plasmids were developed in the pRS416 yeast
shuttle vector using yeast recombination to fuse, in order, 3 distinct PCR products with 31 to
34 bp crossovers on DNA fragments that included a 5’ target gene flank, the HXGPRT select-
able marker, and a 3’ target flank (S6 Fig). Gene targeting plasmids were engineered to delete
the entire ROP or GRA gene locus including 400 bp of the immediate 5’ UTR. The DNA prim-
ers used to generate the 5' and 3' gene targeting flanks and the nucleotides deleted in each ROP
and GRA knockout strain are shown in supplemental material (S1 Table). Targeting plasmids
were linearized via a unique restriction site at the junction of the 5' targeting flank and pRS416
vector prior to transfection into RHΔku80ΔompdcΔupΔhxgprt and continuous selection in
mycophenolic acid (25 μg/ml) and xanthine (250 μM) and uracil as previously described
[13,14,92,103,104]. Isolates were subcloned 20 days after transfection by limiting dilution. Tar-
geted knockouts were validated by genotype analysis using PCR assays (S6 Fig) to measure: (i)
PCR 1, targeted deletion of the coding region of the targeted gene (DF and DR primers); (ii)
PCR 2, correct targeted 5' integration (CXF & 5'DHFRCXR primers); and (iii) PCR 3, correct
targeted 3' integration (3'DHFRCXF and CXR primers) using DNA validation primers shown
in supplemental material (S2 Table).
Complementation
Selected knockout strains were complemented with wild-type or mutant alleles of the deleted
ROP gene. A new positive genetic selection was developed for uracil auxotroph backgrounds
based on cytosine auxotrophy using the cytosine deaminase (CD) selectable marker that con-
verts cytosine to uracil [105]. Genes for complementation analysis were C-terminally tagged
with the HA peptide to allow fluorescent visualization of protein expression and the comple-
menting genes were targeted for integration at the OMPDC gene locus that was already deleted
for OMPDC and HXGPRT [13]. Complementation targeting plasmids were developed in the
pRS416 yeast shuttle vector using yeast recombination to fuse, in order, a 5' OMPDC target
flank, the complementing gene of interest plus the genes 5' UTR (~ 1 Kbp) synthesized on one
or two PCR products, the CD selectable marker, and the 3' OMPDC target flank (S7 Fig). The
DNA primers used to generate the complementing gene (synthesized on one two or three PCR
products), the CD marker, and target flanks are shown in supplemental material (S1 Table and
S3 Table). Mutant ROP18 alleles expressing a kinase-dead (KD) ROP18, or mutant ROP18
lacking the PVM and ATF6β association domain (RAH2ATF) were designed using previously
described mutations [63,77]. Targeting plasmids were linearized via a unique restriction site at
the junction of the 5' targeting flank and pRS416 vector prior to transfection. Following trans-
fection parasites were grown 1 d in uracil medium, then were switched to selection medium
containing 1 mM cytosine, and isolates were subcloned 30 days later by limiting dilution.

 Targeted knockouts were validated by genotype analysis using PCR assays (S7 Fig) to measure:
(i) PCR 4, correct targeted 5' integration and (ii) PCR 5, correct targeted 3' integration of the
complementing transgene and CD at the OMPDC locus using DNA validation primers (S4
Table).
Immunofluorescence assays
HFF cells were cultured on circular micro cover glass (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and were
infected with parasites for 18–30 h. For localization of rhoptry proteins to the rhoptry organ-
elles, infected cells were fixed with Histochoice (Amresco), and permeabilized in 0.1% saponin
(Sigma) for 10 min. For localization of rhoptry proteins to the PVM, infected cells were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde and exposed to 0.002% digitonin for 5 minutes as previously
described [62] to expose proteins associated with the cytosolic face of the PVM. All samples
were blocked with 10% FBS and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of primary rabbit monoclonal
α-HA-tag antibodies (Cell Signaling) 1 h at room temperature. Preparations were washed 3
times with PBS and incubated 1 h at RT with a 1:1000 dilution of secondary goat anti-rabbit
IgG antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488. Samples were mounted in Slowfade Gold anti-
fade with DAPI (Life Technologies) and then imaged with a Nikon A1R SI confocal micro-
scope (Nikon, Inc.). Confocal images were processed with FIJI [129]. Vacuole locations were
determined by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy.
Flow cytometry
Antibodies used were CD16/CD32 (93, ebioscience), APC-Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse CD45
(30-F11, Biolegend), and AF647-conjugated anti-mouse CD11c (N418, Biolegend). FACS anal-
ysis was performed using a Miltenyi 8-color MACSQuant and data was analyzed using FlowJo
v9.77 and v10 (TreeStar).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using PRISM software (Graphpad Software). Statistical sig-
nificance in acute virulence assays in mice was determined using the Log-rank Mantel-Cox test
performed using the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test. P values less than or equal to 0.05
(P<0.05) were considered to be significant. All other statistic analysis was performed using an
unpaired two-tailed Students t test with the assumption of equal variance, and a P value less
than or equal to 0.05 (P<0.05) was considered to be significant.

mented OMPΔrop18 strains: wild-type ROP18 (OMPΔrop18::ROP18), a kinase-dead (KD) ROP18
(OMPΔrop18::ROP18KD), a RAH2 domain deleted ROP18 (OMPΔrop18::ROP18RAH2(ATF)), or a
kinase-dead and RAH2(ATF) mutant (OMPΔrop18::ROP18 RAH2(ATF),KD). DAPI stains the nuclei
of both parasites and the host cells they invaded. The HA tag (revealed) by green fluorescence
associated with apical rhoptry organelles is present in the complemented ROP18 strains and is
absence in the ROP18 deleted strain. Vacuole locations are shown by differential interference con-
trast (DIC) microscopy. (B) Bone marrow derived macrophages were stimulated with IFN-γ and
TNF-α and parasite survival (measured as PFU) was determined for complemented OMPΔrop18
strains: wild-type ROP18 (OMPΔrop18::ROP18), a kinase-dead (KD) ROP18 (OMPΔrop18::
ROP18KD), or a RAH2 domain deleted ROP18 (OMPΔrop18::ROP18RAH2(ATF)).
