IMPORTANCE Although asthma is a chronic disease, the expected rate of spontaneous
remissions of adult asthma and the stability of diagnosis are unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether a diagnosis of current asthma could be ruled out and asthma
medications safely stopped in randomly selected adults with physician-diagnosed asthma.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted
in 10 Canadian cities from January 2012 to February 2016. Random digit dialing was used to
recruit adult participants who reported a history of physician-diagnosed asthma established
within the past 5 years. Participants using long-term oral steroids and participants unable to
be tested using spirometry were excluded. Information from the diagnosing physician was
obtained to determine how the diagnosis of asthma was originally made in the community.
Of 1026 potential participants who fulfilled eligibility criteria during telephone screening, 701
(68.3%) agreed to enter into the study. All participants were assessed with home peak flow
and symptom monitoring, spirometry, and serial bronchial challenge tests, and those
participants using daily asthma medications had their medications gradually tapered off over
4 study visits. Participants in whom a diagnosis of current asthma was ultimately ruled out
were followed up clinically with repeated bronchial challenge tests over 1 year.
EXPOSURE Physician-diagnosed asthma established within the past 5 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the proportion of participants
in whom a diagnosis of current asthma was ruled out, defined as participants who exhibited
no evidence of acute worsening of asthma symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction,
or bronchial hyperresponsiveness after having all asthma medications tapered off and after
a study pulmonologist established an alternative diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included
the proportion with asthma ruled out after 12 months and the proportion who underwent
an appropriate initial diagnostic workup for asthma in the community.
RESULTS Of 701 participants (mean [SD] age, 51 [16] years; 467 women [67%]), 613
completed the study and could be conclusively evaluated for a diagnosis of current asthma.
Current asthma was ruled out in 203 of 613 study participants (33.1%; 95% CI, 29.4%-36.8%).
Twelve participants (2.0%) were found to have serious cardiorespiratory conditions that had
been previously misdiagnosed as asthma in the community. After an additional 12 months of
follow-up, 181 participants (29.5%; 95% CI, 25.9%-33.1%) continued to exhibit no clinical or
laboratory evidence of asthma. Participants in whom current asthma was ruled out,
compared with those in whom it was confirmed, were less likely to have undergone testing
for airflow limitation in the community at the time of initial diagnosis (43.8% vs 55.6%,
respectively; absolute difference, 11.8%; 95% CI, 2.1%-21.5%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with physician-diagnosed asthma, a current
diagnosis of asthma could not be established in 33.1% who were not using daily asthma
medications or had medications weaned. In patients such as these, reassessing the asthma
diagnosis may be warranted.

A
sthma is defined as a disease characterized by chronic
airway inflammation that results in respiratory symp-
tomsofwheeze,dyspnea,chesttightness,orcoughthat
vary over time and in intensity, together with variable expi-
ratory airflow limitation.1 A necessary condition of all guide-
line definitions of asthma is that tests of expiratory airflow are
needed to confirm the diagnosis.2-4
Diagnosis of asthma in the community can be difficult.
Various phenotypes of asthma have been identified, includ-
ing atopic, nonallergic, and late-onset asthma, all of which
potentially have different triggers and clinical presentations.5
Furthermore, asthma can be episodic or can follow a relaps-
ing and remitting course, which further complicates attempts
to arrive at a diagnosis based on a single patient-physician
encounter. Studies have shown that many physicians choose
to diagnose and treat patients empirically for asthma and
that in the community asthma is sometimes poorly investi-
gated, with fewer than half of patients receiving spirometry
testing to confirm variable expiratory airflow limitation prior
to diagnosis.6-8
Contemporary asthma guidelines suggest stepping down
asthmatreatmentoncegoodasthmacontrolhasbeenachieved
andmaintainedfor3months.3Thegoalofsteppingdowntreat-
ment is to find the patient’
s minimum effective treatment that
maintains good control of symptoms and exacerbations and
minimizes the costs of treatment and potential for adverse ef-
fects. However, few experimental data have been reported on
the optimal timing, sequence, and magnitude of treatment re-
ductions in asthma. Furthermore, the expected rate of spon-
taneous remission of adult asthma, allowing for complete ces-
sation of asthma therapy, is unknown.
The primary objective of this study was to determine
whether a diagnosis of current asthma could be ruled out in
randomly selected adult patients with recent physician-
diagnosed asthma and whether these patients could be safely
weaned off asthma medications.
Methods
Study Participants
Study participants were recruited from the general popula-
tion from January 2012 to February 2015 via random digit
dialing of both landlines and cellular phones. Potential par-
ticipants were randomly sampled from the 10 largest cities in
Canada and from surrounding areas. The target population
included residents in these cities and rural or suburban resi-
dents residing in telephone exchanges known to be located
within a 90-minute drive of each of the 10 metropolitan areas.
For the urban, suburban, and semirural subpopulations within
Canada,telephonecoverageisalmostuniversal;thus,thesam-
pling technique was meant to approximate a true random
sample of the Canadian adult population with asthma.
Telephone respondents were asked the following ques-
tion via a recorded message from the local study coordinator:
“Is there a member of your household aged 18 years of age or
older who has been diagnosed with asthma within the last 5
years?” If the telephone respondent indicated yes, the study
coordinator subsequently contacted the identified person
with asthma in the household directly. Participants were
informed that patients with asthma were being studied, but
the participants were not informed of the objectives of the
study to avoid biasing enrollment in favor of those partici-
pants who potentially doubted their asthma diagnosis. Par-
ticipants who fit the screening eligibility criteria were then
invited to the local study center for a complete eligibility
assessment and entry into the study. The study was approved
by the research ethics boards of the 10 participating study
hospitals, and all patients who participated in the study pro-
vided written informed consent.
Eligible participants were at least 18 years old and had
physician-diagnosed asthma established within the past 5
years. The rationale for choosing only individuals with
recently diagnosed asthma was to evaluate contemporary
diagnostic practices. Evaluation of individuals with recently
diagnosed asthma also allowed collection of medical records
available from the original diagnosing physicians to deter-
mine how asthma was diagnosed in the community. Patients
were excluded from participating if they were using long-
term oral steroids; if they were pregnant, breastfeeding, or
unable to perform spirometry; if a bronchial challenge test
was contraindicated (because of known aortic or cerebral
aneurysms or history of myocardial infarction or stroke
within 3 previous months); or if they had a smoking history
greater than 10 pack-years (to exclude patients with possible
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
Participant Study Assessments
Prior to undergoing spirometry, participants completed the
European Community Respiratory Health Survey,9 the
Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire,10 and assessments of
their asthma medical history and health care utilization.
They then were evaluated using the diagnostic algorithm for
confirming current asthma as shown in Figure 1. They per-
formed prebronchodilator spirometry according to American
Thoracic Society standards.11 Postbronchodilator spirometry
was assessed 15 minutes later after administration of 400 μg
of albuterol given by a pressurized metered dose inhaler with
a spacer device. Patients whose forced expiratory volume in
the first second of expiration (FEV1) improved by at least 12%
and at least 200 mL after bronchodilator administration were
considered to have reversible airflow obstruction characteris-
tic of current asthma.1
Key Points
Question Can current asthma be ruled out and can asthma
medications be safely stopped in some adult patients with
physician-diagnosed asthma?
Findings In this multicenter cohort study that enrolled 701
randomly selected adults with physician-diagnosed asthma,
current asthma was excluded in 33% of the 613 participants who
completed the study.
Meaning Among some adult patients with physician-diagnosed
asthma, reassessing that diagnosis may be warranted.

Patients who did not exhibit reversible airflow obstruc-
tion returned to the pulmonary function laboratory for a bron-
chial challenge test. They were asked to withhold long-acting
β-agonists for 48 hours and short-acting β-agonists for 8 hours
prior to testing. The FEV1 was measured at baseline and again
after inhalation of normal saline, then doubling concentra-
tions of methacholine from 0.03 to 16.0 mg/mL in normal sa-
line solution were delivered using a Wright or Puritan-Bennett
twinnebulizerandinhaledbytidalbreathingfor2minuteswith
the nose clipped. The FEV1 was measured at 30 seconds and
90 seconds after each dose. Doubling concentrations of
methacholine were given at 5-minute intervals until the FEV1
decreased by 20% from baseline or until a dose of 16 mg/mL
had been reached. Individuals with a decrease in FEV1 of
20% or more with 8 mg/mL of methacholine or less were de-
fined as having airway hyperresponsiveness characteristic
of current asthma.12
Participants who had a negative bronchial challenge
test result at visit 2 and who reported not using any asthma-
controlling medications within the previous 3 weeks pro-
ceededtoassessmentbyastudypulmonologist(Figure1).Those
participants with a negative bronchial challenge test result at
visit 2 who were using daily asthma-controlling medications
were gradually tapered from their asthma maintenance medi-
cations (Figure 1). They were asked to halve their usual in-
haled steroid dose and long-acting bronchodilator, to discon-
tinue their antileukotriene medication, and to keep a daily
symptom diary and record daily peak flow rates using a peak
flow meter. They were permitted to use short-acting broncho-
dilators on an as-needed basis. At the third study visit 3 weeks
later, symptom assessments and home peak flow measure-
ments were reviewed and bronchial challenge testing was re-
peated. If the patients had no intercurrent acute worsening of
symptoms, their peak flow measurements showed no variable
declinesinairflow,andtheirbronchialchallengetestresultwas
negative, then their inhaled steroid and their long-acting
β-agonist were completely stopped, and they returned for a
fourth study visit and bronchial challenge testing 3 weeks later.

Patients who had exacerbations of asthma symptoms at
any point during their medication tapering period were seen
by study pulmonologists and had spirometry performed. If the
study physician determined that the patient was having an
asthma exacerbation or worsening, a diagnosis of current
asthma was confirmed.
Patients who did not experience exacerbations of symp-
toms and who continued to have negative results on bron-
chial challenge testing despite having discontinued all
asthma medications were classified as having normal airway
responsiveness and were then formally assessed by a study
pulmonologist in consultation. The study pulmonologists
assessed the patients’symptoms and physical findings and
were instructed to order any additional diagnostic testing
they felt was clinically indicated to attempt to reach a diag-
nosis. Once the diagnostic workup was completed, the study
pulmonologist was asked to assign a diagnosis to each
patient. Two independent pulmonologists reviewed the con-
sultation reports to determine agreement with the treating
pulmonologist’
s diagnosis. Patients who were assigned diag-
noses other than current asthma by the study pulmonologist
were asked to not use asthma medications for the remainder
of the study period (12 months after visit 4).
All patients in whom current asthma had been excluded
were followed up for 12 months and had repeat bronchial chal-
lenge tests at 6 and 12 months in addition to regular tele-
phone follow-up with assessment of health care outcomes ev-
ery 3 months. Participants were encouraged to present to the
study pulmonologist if they experienced any worsening of re-
spiratory symptoms during this period.
Assessment of How the Asthma Diagnosis
Was Initially Established in the Community
The physician of each study participant was contacted and
asked to review the patient’
s medical record and to answer
a questionnaire that inquired whether the diagnosis of
asthma was initially made based on symptoms alone, based
on symptoms and physical findings, or based on symptoms,
physical findings, and diagnostic tests such as spirometry,
peak expiratory flows, and/or bronchial challenge testing. If
objective diagnostic testing was performed, faxed copies of
the test results were requested from the physician’
s office.
Physicians were offered a standard reimbursement to pro-
vide these data.
The diagnostic tests received from the community were
reviewed by 2 study pulmonologists blinded to the patients’
outcomes. The study pulmonologists assessed whether the
tests done in the community were of adequate quality and
whether the tests were diagnostic of asthma (ie, improve-
ment in FEV1 by ≥12% after bronchodilator use, positive
bronchial challenge test result, or average daily diurnal peak
expiratory flow variability >10%). A third pulmonologist
blinded to the patients’outcomes adjudicated decisions in
cases for which there was disagreement.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in
whom the diagnosis of current asthma was ruled out.
Patients who did not have evidence of acute worsening of
asthma symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, or bron-
chial hyperresponsiveness despite discontinuing all asthma
medications during the 4-visit study algorithm and who were
assessed by the study pulmonologist as having a diagnosis
other than current asthma were considered to have met the
primary outcome.
The proportion of patients in whom the diagnosis of
current asthma was ruled out after 12 months of further
follow-up was evaluated as a secondary outcome. Those
who did not have evidence of acute worsening of asthma
symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, or bronchial
hyperresponsiveness after 12 months of follow-up without
use of asthma medications were considered to have met this
outcome. Other secondary outcomes included the propor-
tion of enrolled participants who previously had undergone
an appropriate initial workup for diagnosis of asthma in the
community (with assessment of variable expiratory airflow
limitation by spirometry, bronchial challenge testing, or
serial peak flow measurements) and the proportion of indi-
viduals whose community diagnostic workup was positive
for asthma.
Statistical Analysis
Prior to commencing the study, it was estimated that a
sample size of 644 participants would allow, after premature
dropouts, for conclusive assessment for current asthma in
580 participants. This sample size was calculated, based on
results from a previous study, to allow for expected exclusion
of current asthma in 20% of the cohort with 95% confidence
intervals of ±3.5%.13 The principal analysis was descriptive
and included estimates of proportions with 95% confidence
intervals. A 2-sided P ≤ .05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were
used to examine the determinants of confirmation of current
asthma, after controlling for 3 prespecified, clinically impor-
tant variables: age, sex, and body mass index (BMI; calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared). The other variables included in the model (age at
diagnosis, diagnosis by a specialist, airflow testing done in
the community, use of daily asthma medications, FEV1 per-
centage predicted, dyspnea within 12 months, wheeze within
12 months, and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire total
score) were chosen post hoc based on analyses that showed
statistically strong associations (P threshold < .10) between
the individual variables and confirmation or exclusion of cur-
rent asthma. SAS version 9.3 statistical software (SAS Insti-
tute Inc) was used for all analyses.

701 (68.3%) presented to a study site for assessment and
were entered into the study. Demographic information was
not collected from the 325 participants who were eligible to
enter the study but chose not to participate.
Assessment of Current Asthma in the Study Cohort
Of 701 participants who entered into the study (mean [SD]
age, 51 [16] years; 467 women [67%]), 64 withdrew early
prior to establishment of a diagnosis and 24 could not
undergo bronchial challenge testing for reasons described in
Figure 2. Ultimately 613 participants completed the study
assessment procedures and could be conclusively evaluated
for a diagnosis of current asthma (Figure 2 and Table 1). Of
these 613 participants, 531 (86.6%) reported recent use
of asthma medications and 273 (44.5%) reported daily use of
asthma-controlling medications (inhaled corticosteroids
and/or antileukotriene medications).
Three hundred eighty-two individuals (62.3%) were con-
firmed to have current asthma during the 4-visit diagnostic
assessment period. The diagnosis of asthma was confirmed
in 86 of these individuals (22.5%) by demonstrating revers-
ibility in airflow obstruction after albuterol administration at
the first study visit, in 287 (75.1%) by demonstrating bron-
chial hyperresponsiveness via bronchial challenge testing at
the second, third, or fourth study visit, and in 9 (2.4%) based
on an acute worsening of asthma symptoms during the medi-
cation tapering period.
Two hundred thirty-one participants had no evidence of
airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, or wors-
ening of symptoms after being tapered off all asthma medica-
tions. Of these 231 participants, 213 (92.2%) were assessed by
a study pulmonologist in face-to-face consultation and 18
(7.8%) were assessed remotely by telephone. The study pul-
monologist diagnosed asthma in 28 participants after
completion of the face-to-face consultation and diagnostic
workup, but alternative diagnoses were made for the remain-
der (Table 2). Eighteen participants did not attend their
scheduled consultation appointment with the pulmonologist
and were instead assessed by telephone; they each denied
respiratory symptoms and were considered asymptomatic.

Current asthma was ruled out in 203 of 613 study participants
(33.1%; 95% CI, 29.4%-36.8%).
Patient Characteristics Associated With Exclusion
of Current Asthma
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the 203 partici-
pants in whom current asthma was ruled out, compared with
the 410 participants in whom asthma was confirmed. Those
in whom current asthma was ruled out, compared with those
with confirmed asthma, had significantly better lung func-
tion and were less likely to be using asthma medications
(79.3% vs 90.2%, respectively; absolute difference, 10.9%;
95% CI, 4.7%-17.2%) or daily asthma-controlling medications
(35.0% vs 49.3%, respectively; absolute difference, 14.3%;
95% CI, 6.1%-22.4%). Those in whom asthma was excluded
were less likely to report that they had spirometry performed
at the time of asthma diagnosis, and this was confirmed on
receipt of the diagnosing community physicians’reports;
only 43.8% of participants in whom asthma was ruled out
had evidence of having undergone assessment of variable
airflow limitation (spirometry, bronchial challenge testing, or
serial measurements of peak flows) in the community, com-
pared with 55.6% of those in whom asthma was confirmed
(absolute difference, 11.8%; 95% CI, 2.1%-21.5%).
Multivariable logistic regression analysis confirmed that
lower FEV1 percentage predicted, daily use of asthma medi-
cations,objectiveconfirmationofairflowlimitationinthecom-
munity through diagnostic testing, and history of wheezing
were significantly associated with confirmation of current
asthma after controlling for participants’age, sex, and BMI
(Figure 3).

medical record review. The diagnosing physician provided
evidence of spirometry and/or bronchial challenge testing
and/or serial peak flow testing having been done to confirm
the diagnosis of asthma in 269 of 530 patients (50.8%). For
the remaining patients, asthma was diagnosed based on
symptoms and/or physical findings alone.
Table 3 shows the results of the diagnostic testing that had
been done in the community in the 613 participants who com-
pleted the study. Patients whose current asthma was con-
firmed by the study protocol were more likely than those in
whomasthmawasruledouttohaveundergonediagnostictest-
ing for airflow limitation in the community (55.6% vs 43.8%,
respectively; absolute difference, 11.8%; 95% CI, 2.1%-
21.5%), and their tests in the community were more likely to
have been diagnostic of asthma (35.1% vs 16.4%, respec-
tively; absolute difference, 18.6%; 95% CI, 10.7%-26.6%).
Results of 1 Year of Additional Follow-up
After 1 year of additional follow-up, 22 of 203 participants in
whom current asthma had been ruled out had a positive
bronchial challenge test result at either 6 or 12 months. Of
these 22 participants, 16 were asymptomatic and did not
experience any respiratory exacerbations, and these partici-
pants did not resume use of their asthma medications. Six
participants presented with respiratory symptoms and
resumed treatment with asthma medications; 1 of these par-
ticipants was also treated with a brief course of oral cortico-
steroid. The remaining 181 participants (29.5%; 95% CI,
25.9%-33.1%) exhibited no clinical or laboratory evidence of
asthma during the 12 months of follow-up.
Alternative Diagnoses in Participants
Who Did Not Have Current Asthma
Table 2 lists the pulmonologists’diagnoses in the 213 pa-
tients who had an in-person pulmonologist consultation. The
most common alternative diagnoses were for relatively be-
nign conditions, and many patients were asymptomatic. How-
ever, 12 of these patients (2.0% of the study cohort) had seri-
ous cardiorespiratory conditions that had been misdiagnosed
as asthma, including 4 individuals with ischemic heart dis-
ease (2 of whom required percutaneous coronary interven-
tion), 2 with subglottic stenosis (both of whom required air-
way dilatation procedures), 2 with bronchiectasis, and 1 each
with interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, sar-
coidosis, and tracheobronchomalacia.
Subgroup Analysis of Participants
Using Daily Asthma-Controlling Medications
Of 273 participants who were using daily asthma-controlling
medications at study entry, current asthma was ruled out in
71 participants (26.0%; 95% CI, 20.8%-31.2%). After 12 months
of follow-up, 68 of the 273 participants (24.9%; 95% CI, 19.8%-
30.0%) remained free of current asthma.
Discussion
This study found that 33.1% of adult participants randomly
recruited from the community who had been diagnosed
with asthma in the previous 5 years had no evidence of cur-
rent asthma when they were prospectively evaluated with
serial assessments of symptoms, lung function, and bron-
chial provocation tests while not using asthma medications.
More than 90% of participants in whom asthma was ruled
out had asthma medications safely stopped for an addi-
tional 1-year period.
Two phenomena may account for failure to ultimately
confirm current asthma in 33.1% of the study cohort: (1)
spontaneous remission of previously active asthma; and (2)
misdiagnosis of asthma in the community. At least 24 of 203
participants (11.8%) in whom current asthma was ruled out
had undergone pulmonary function tests in the community
that had been previously diagnostic of asthma. These partici-
pants presumably experienced spontaneous remission of
their asthma at some time between their initial community
diagnosis and entry into the study. This variability in asthma
diagnosis, with opportunity for remission and relapse, is fur-
ther supported by the fact that 22 participants in whom cur-
rent asthma was ruled out subsequently had a positive bron-
chial challenge test result during 1 year of follow-up.
This study also suggests that misdiagnosis of asthma may
occasionally occur in the community.14,15 In 2.0% of study par-
ticipants, a serious untreated cardiorespiratory condition was

identified that may have been previously misdiagnosed as
asthma.Inaddition,thestudydemonstratedthatfailuretocon-
sistently use objective testing at the time of initial diagnosis
of asthma was associated with failure to confirm current
asthma. These results suggest that whenever possible, physi-
cians should order objective tests, such as prebronchodilator
and postbronchodilator spirometry, serial peak flow measure-
ments, or bronchial challenge tests, to confirm asthma at the
time of initial diagnosis.
A 2008 Canadian study failed to confirm asthma in 30%
to 33% of obese and nonobese participants who had been pre-
viously diagnosed with asthma.13 However, the 2008 study
could draw only limited conclusions because participants in-
cluded in that study were not recently diagnosed with asthma,
the study was limited by lack of long-term follow-up to ex-
clude possible remission and then recurrence of asthma, as-
certainment for prior objective diagnosis of asthma in the com-
munitywaslacking,andparticipantsdidnotundergospecialist
assessment to definitively rule out asthma and to determine
alternative diagnoses.13
Studies from Italy16 and the Netherlands17 have sug-
gested that asthma may be overdiagnosed in adults and chil-
dren. However, these previous studies were cross-sectional
studies in highly selected cohorts. The current study has the
advantage of having randomly recruited participants from the
community. A further strength of the current study is that par-
ticipants were studied longitudinally over 12 weeks using an
objective, rigorous diagnostic algorithm, which was followed
by pulmonologist assessment to try to rule in or rule out cur-
rent asthma.
There are consequences associated with overtreating
asthma that is in remission or treating misdiagnosed
asthma. Consequences include the patient’
s potential expo-
sure to the adverse effects of asthma medications18 and the
costs of asthma medications.19 Thirty-five percent of the
participants in whom current asthma was ruled out were
using daily asthma-controlling medications. Use of asthma
medications in these patients presumably provided only
risks for medication adverse effects and cost, with little
opportunity for therapeutic benefit.20 An economic analysis
has previously demonstrated that ruling out active asthma
in those with presumed physician-diagnosed asthma is
cost-effective.21
Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines suggest stepping
down asthma treatment once good asthma control has been
achieved and maintained for 3 months.1 Results of this
study suggest that 33.1% of individuals with recently diag-
nosed asthma can safely have their asthma medications
tapered and discontinued within 5 years of their initial diag-
nosis. Furthermore, the study tapering algorithm was not
associated with any adverse events and represents a safe
and practical approach to operationalize guideline recom-
mendations to taper (and, if possible, to stop) asthma medi-
cations in stable patients.

Many study patients who were ultimately found to not
have current asthma had already stopped use of daily
asthma-controlling medications before even entering the
study. Lack of use of daily asthma medications was signifi-
cantly associated with exclusion of current asthma. This sug-
gests that many patients may be able to tell when their
asthma is in remission, and they may self-adjust and even
stop use of their asthma medications, with or without the
advice of a physician.22
This study has limitations. Participants in whom current
asthma was ruled out were followed for up to 15 months, but
it is possible that some patients in remission, such as those
with intermittent asthma provoked by specific allergens,
could experience subsequent recurrence of asthma beyond a
15-month follow-up period. The sensitivity of bronchial chal-
lenge tests to detect asthma is 98% but not 100%, meaning
that a very small number of individuals with current asthma
may have been missed by the study testing algorithm.23 Con-
versely, the specificity of bronchial challenge tests is less than
80%, and the test can be falsely positive in patients with
allergic rhinitis or in smokers without asthma.23 This lack of
specificity may have limited the study’
s ability to rule out
current asthma in some participants (ie, the proportion who
did not have current asthma may be even higher than
detected).
Patients using long-term oral corticosteroids for asthma
or for other conditions were excluded, and this could poten-
tially skew the study sample toward those with milder
asthma; however, only 22 participants initially contacted by
telephone were excluded for this reason. Another limitation
is that many potential participants refused to answer tele-
phone eligibility questions, and only 68.3% of those who
were judged eligible participated, which could introduce
selection bias into the study. Demographic information
was not collected from the 325 individuals who were eligible
to enter the study but chose not to participate; therefore,
a comparison of study participants with nonparticipants was
not possible.
Twenty-four percent of community physicians did not re-
spond to a request for diagnostic records, and it is thus im-
possible to determine whether the initial diagnostic workup
and hence the initial diagnosis of asthma in these partici-
pants were appropriate. Therefore, distinguishing misdiagno-
sis from remission of asthma in some study participants is im-
possible.Eveninparticipantswhohadlackedreversibleairflow
obstruction at diagnosis it is difficult to know with certainty
whethertheyweremisdiagnosed,becausespirometryhasrela-
tively limited sensitivity to accurately confirm asthma in pri-
mary care.24 In many cases, spirometry was performed after
treatment for asthma was initiated in the community, further
decreasing its sensitivity.
Conclusions
Among adults with physician-diagnosed asthma, a current di-
agnosis of asthma could not be established in 33.1% who were
not using daily asthma medications or had medications
weaned. In patients such as these, reassessing the asthma di-
agnosis may be warranted.
