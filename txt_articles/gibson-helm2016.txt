PCOS diagnosis experience and support needs  
Context: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, chronic and under-recognized 
disorder. Diagnosis experience may have lasting effects on wellbeing and self-management.  
Objective: To investigate PCOS diagnosis experiences, information provided and concerns 
about PCOS. 
Design: Cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire. 
Setting: Recruitment via support group websites in 2015-2016. 
Participants: 1385 women with a reported diagnosis of PCOS, living in North America 
(53.0%), Europe (42.2%) or other world regions (4.9%), 64.8% of whom were 18-35 years old. 
Main Outcome Measures: Satisfaction with PCOS diagnosis experience, satisfaction with 
PCOS information received at the time of diagnosis, and current concerns about PCOS. 
Results: One third or more of women reported more than two years (33.6%) and three or more 
health professionals (47.1%) before a diagnosis was established. The minority were satisfied 
with their diagnosis experience (35.2%) or with the information they received (15.6%). 
Satisfaction with PCOS information received was positively associated with diagnosis 
satisfaction (odds ratio (OR): 7.0 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.9 to 9.9); seeing ≥5 health 
professionals (OR: 0.5 95%CI: 0.3 to 0.8) and longer time to diagnosis (>2 years OR: 0.4 
95%CI: 0.3 to 0.6) were negatively associated with diagnosis satisfaction (independent of time 
since diagnosis, age and world region). Women’s most common concerns were difficulty losing 
weight (53.6%), irregular menstrual cycles (50.8%) and infertility (44.5%).  
Conclusions: In the largest study of PCOS diagnosis experiences, many women reported 
delayed diagnosis and inadequate information. These major gaps in early diagnosis, education 
and support are clear opportunities for improving patient experience. 
Précis: In the largest and only international study of PCOS diagnosis experiences, delayed diagnosis and 
a lack of adequate consumer health information are common and associated with poor patient 
experience. 
Introduction 
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine condition affecting 9-18% of reproductive 
aged women (1-3). Diagnosis commonly requires at least two of three features: polycystic 
ovaries on ultrasound, biochemical/clinical hyperandrogenism and oligo/amenorrhea, with 
exclusion of other etiologies (4). Despite the high prevalence, PCOS is an under-recognized 
condition and many women remain undiagnosed (1).

PCOS affects health and wellbeing over the lifespan (5, 6). It is the most common cause of 
anovulatory infertility (7) and women with PCOS have greater prevalence type 2 diabetes (8), 
risk factors for cardiovascular disease (8), and symptoms of anxiety and depression (9, 10). 
PCOS is exacerbated by obesity (11), and lifestyle management (weight management or loss, 
healthy diet and exercise) and the oral contraceptive pill are first-line treatments (12, 13). 
A previous Australian survey highlighted that PCOS diagnosis is often delayed, involves 
many health professionals and leaves women with unmet information needs (14). These 
experiences may have long-term consequences, with a reported association between the length of 
time to receive a PCOS diagnosis and both anxiety and depression symptoms (15). Diagnosis 
experience could also affect self-management and the ability to improve lifestyle, the 
information sources that women access, and participation in regular screening for metabolic 
complications (16, 17). Despite these potential impacts, there have been few comprehensive 
studies investigating diagnosis experience. Information needs have been investigated in PCOS 
(16-19) but studies have been small or limited in scope. 
This study aimed to investigate women’s diagnosis experiences, information provided, main 
concerns about PCOS and support needs in a large group of women with PCOS primarily in 
North America and Europe. The findings will inform an international initiative to improve 
diagnosis and education to better meet women’s needs and optimize early engagement with 
evidence-based management. This international approach builds on prior research about PCOS 
diagnosis experiences in Australia and investigates how women’s needs may differ in different 
regions. 
Methods 
Ethics approval 
The study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board (protocol 
number: 822252). Participation was voluntary and anonymous. Completion of the survey was 
taken as consent to participate in the study.  
Study Design, Setting and Participants 
In this cross-sectional study a community sample of women were asked to complete an online 
questionnaire in 2015-16. The questionnaire was disseminated via the websites of the two largest 
PCOS support organizations worldwide: PCOS Challenge (USA) and Verity (UK). The link to 
the online questionnaire was accessible to website visitors, emailed to women on PCOS support 
organization mailing lists and promoted through social media. Eligibility criteria included age of 
18 years or greater and a prior diagnosis of PCOS made by a doctor.  
Tools 
This questionnaire was adapted from a PCOS questionnaire previously used in published 
research (14). The original questionnaire was developed with input from a multidisciplinary 
expert advisory group and piloted with women with PCOS (14). The results from the previous 
study, national forums with women, clinicians and academics (20), and experiences of 
international experts informed the refined questionnaire used here. It included demographics, 
PCOS diagnosis experience, information provided at diagnosis, current concerns about PCOS 
features, and support needs (Supplemental File 1). No question was compulsory. Reponses were 
collected using SurveyMethods software (SurveyMethods, Inc. Allen, Texas, USA) and then 
exported and analyzed by the authors.

Variables and Statistical Methods 
Statistical analysis was performed with Stata software version 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, 
Texas, USA). Categorical data are presented as count and proportions. A p-value of <.05 was 
considered statistically significant. 
Logistic regression analyses: diagnosis experience 
Univariable logistic regression analyses generated crude odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) for associations between world region of residence [North America (reference 
category), Europe, other] and aspects of PCOS diagnosis experience. These included time since 
diagnosis, time from first seeing a health professional about PCOS symptoms to when a 
diagnosis was established, number of health professionals seen before receiving a diagnosis, 
satisfaction with their diagnosis experience, and satisfaction with the information received about 
PCOS at the time of diagnosis. 
Univariable logistic regression analyses then tested for associations between overall 
satisfaction with diagnosis experience and potential contributors. These included number of 
health professionals seen [1-2 (reference category), 3-4, 5 or more], time to diagnosis [within 6 
months (reference category), within 12 months, within 2 years, >2 years], satisfaction with 
information provided [dissatisfied or indifferent (reference category), satisfied], time since 
diagnosis [≤1 year (reference category), 1-5 years, 5-10 years, >10 years], age [18-25 years old, 
26-35 years (reference category), 36-45 years, >45 years] and world region of residence [North 
America (reference category), Europe, other]. These six variables were then included in a 
multivariable logistic regression analysis of overall satisfaction with diagnosis experience. 
Logistic regression analyses: information provision at diagnosis 
Univariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to test for associations between world 
region of residence [North America (reference category), Europe, other] and receiving 
information about particular topics at the time of diagnosis, and satisfaction with received 
information. Topics included lifestyle management, medical therapy, long-term complications, 
and emotional support and counselling. Multivariable logistic regression analyses then adjusted 
for age and time since diagnosis. 
Logistic regression analyses: current concerns about PCOS 
Univariable logistic regression analyses assessed associations between the leading current 
concerns (selected by ≥10% of participants) or preferred types of support, and age or world 
region. 
Results 
Participation and demographics 
A total of 1550 questionnaire responses were received. Of these 165 were excluded: one was 
younger than 18 years old, 67 had not been diagnosed with PCOS by a doctor and 97 had 
completed less than half the questionnaire. The remaining 1385 women were born in 48 different 
countries and lived in 32 different countries (Table 1). Approximately half of the participants 
were aged 26-35 years (Table 1). 
Diagnosis experience 
Nearly half the participants saw three or more health professionals before a PCOS diagnosis was 
established and for one third this took longer than two years (Table 2). Only 35.2% were 
satisfied with their diagnosis experience and only 15.6% were satisfied with the information 
about PCOS provided at the time of diagnosis (Table 2).

Univariable logistic regression analysis: diagnosis experience 
There were statistically significant associations between world region and some diagnosis 
experience variables. Women in Europe were more likely to have been diagnosed with PCOS 
more than five years ago than women in North America (OR:1.4, 95%CI: 1.1 to 1.8, p<0.01). 
They were also less likely to have seen three or more health professionals before a diagnosis was 
established (OR:0.8, 95%CI: 0.6 to 0.9, p=0.02). No statistically significant associations were 
noted between world region of residence and overall satisfaction with diagnosis experience, time 
to diagnosis or satisfaction with information provided about PCOS at diagnosis. 
Overall, seeing three or more health professionals was negatively associated with diagnosis 
satisfaction (3-4 health professionals OR:0.6, 95%CI: 0.5 to 0.8, p<0.01; five or more OR:0.4, 
95%CI: 0.3 to 0.6, p<0.01). A time to diagnosis of more than six months was also negatively 
associated with diagnosis satisfaction (12 months OR:0.5, 95%CI: 0.3 to 0.7, p<0.01; two years 
OR:0.5, 95%CI: 0.3 to 0.7, p<0.01; more than two years OR:0.4, 95%CI: 0.3 to 0.5, p<0.01). 
Satisfaction with information received about PCOS was positively associated with diagnosis 
satisfaction (OR:6.9, 95%CI: 5.0 to 9.6, p<0.01). 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis: diagnosis experience 
The multivariable model for satisfaction with diagnosis experience included time to diagnosis, 
number of health professionals seen, satisfaction with information received, time since diagnosis, 
current age and world region. In this model satisfaction with information received was positively 
associated with diagnosis satisfaction (OR:7.0, 95%CI: 4.9 to 9.9, p<0.01). Seeing five or more 
health professionals (OR:0.5, 95%CI: 0.3 to 0.8, p=0.01) and time to diagnosis greater than six 
months (12 months OR:0.6, 95%CI: 0.4 to 0.9, p=0.01; two years OR:0.5, 95%CI: 0.3 to 0.8, 
p=0.01; more than two years OR:0.4, 95%CI: 0.3 to 0.6, p<0.01) were negatively associated with 
diagnosis satisfaction. These associations were independent of age, world region and time since 
diagnosis. 
Information provision at diagnosis 
Less than one quarter were satisfied with PCOS related information given at diagnosis about 
lifestyle management and medical therapy (Table 2). Over half reported not receiving any 
information about long-term PCOS complications or emotional support and counselling (Table 
2). 
Regression analysis: information provision at diagnosis 
Univariable logistic regression analyses found that women in Europe were less likely to report 
receiving information about medical therapy (OR:0.6, 95%CI: 0.5 to 0.8, p<0.01), long-term 
complications (OR:0.8, 95%CI: 0.6 to 1.0, p=0.03) and emotional support (OR:0.7, 95%CI: 0.6 
to 0.9, p<0.01) than women in North America. They were also less likely to be satisfied with 
information provided about medical therapy (OR:0.7, 95%CI: 0.5 to 1.0, p=0.03) and long-term 
complications (OR:0.6, 95%CI: 0.4 to 0.9, p=0.02). Women in other world regions were more 
likely to be satisfied with information about long-term complications (OR:2.4, 95%CI: 1.1 to 5.3, 
p=0.03) and emotional support (OR:3.8, 95%CI: 1.4 to 9.8, p=0.01) than women in North 
America. 
After adjusting for current age and time since diagnosis, women in Europe were less likely to 
report receiving information about medical therapy (OR:0.6, 95%CI: 0.5 to 0.8, p<0.01) or 
emotional support and counselling (OR:0.7, 95%CI: 0.6 to 0.9, p=0.01) than women in North 
America. Women in Europe were also less likely to be satisfied with information about long-
term complications (OR:0.6, 95%CI: 0.4 to 1.0, p=0.03). Women in other world regions were

more likely to be satisfied with emotional support (OR:3.8, 95%CI: 1.3 to 10.7, p=0.01) than 
women in North America. 
Key concerns about PCOS 
Women were asked to select “the four key clinical features of PCOS that are most important to 
you”. Overall, difficulty losing weight, irregular menstrual cycles, infertility and excess hair 
growth were the most commonly selected features (Figure 1). 
Univariable logistic regression analysis: key concerns, age and world region 
Compared to women aged 26-35 years, women aged 18-25 years were more likely to identify 
irregular cycles and ovarian cysts as key concerns and less likely to identify insulin resistance 
(Table 3). Women aged 36-45 years were more likely to identify excess hair growth, increased 
weight gain, insulin resistance and increased risk of metabolic complications as key concerns 
than women aged 26-35 years. They were also less likely to identify reproductive concerns 
(Table 3). Women aged over 45 years were more likely to identify insulin resistance and 
increased risk of metabolic complications as key concerns and less likely to identify reproductive 
concerns or acne (Table 3). 
Compared to women living in North America, women living in Europe were more likely to 
identify anxiety or depression and clinical hyperandrogenism as key concerns and less likely to 
identify difficulty losing weight, hormone imbalance/excess male-type hormones and insulin 
resistance (Table 3).  
Support needs 
When asked “How can we best support women with PCOS?” Overall, 90.3% of women 
(1134/1256) selected “Provide broadly available educational materials”, 70.1% (881/1256) 
selected “Support and present at patient forums and workshops”, 65.0% (816/1256) selected 
“Maintain a consumer website” and 59.9% (753/1256) selected “Send a regular email on PCOS”. 
Women in Europe were less likely to select broad education material (OR:0.6, 95%CI: 0.4 to 0.9, 
p=0.01), presentations at patient forums (OR:0.5, 95%CI: 0.4 to 0.7, p<0.01) or a consumer 
website (OR:0.6, 95%CI: 0.5 to 0.8, p<0.01) than women in North America. Women aged 18-25 
years were less likely to select a consumer website (OR:0.5, 95%CI: 0.4 to 0.8, p<0.01) than 
women aged 26-35 years. Among the 14.1% (177/1256) that selected “other”, the most 
commonly suggested support was health professional education regarding PCOS. 
Discussion 
Summary of findings 
In this large, international study of PCOS diagnosis experiences, women reported that receiving 
a diagnosis of PCOS required several months to years and consultations with multiple health 
professionals. In all world regions, very few women were satisfied with their diagnosis 
experience or with the information provided at the time of diagnosis. The leading concerns that 
women had about PCOS were difficulty losing weight, irregular menstrual cycles, infertility and 
hirsutism. Differences were noted across age groups and world regions for some concerns. 
Overall, women were in favor of all suggested modes of support. 
Diagnosis experience 
Establishing the diagnosis of PCOS involved three or more health professionals and took at least 
a year for many women in each world region. Across different world regions, few women were 
satisfied with the diagnosis experience, confirming previous Australian findings (14). Our results 
are also consistent with qualitative research from the UK and Australia, reporting frustration at

delayed PCOS diagnosis (17, 21). Here we present new knowledge about contributors to poor 
diagnosis experience. Irrespective of world region and current age, a longer time to diagnosis and 
a greater number of health professionals seen were negatively associated with diagnosis 
satisfaction, whereas satisfaction with information provided was positively associated with 
diagnosis satisfaction. The significance for women’s wellbeing is suggested by the importance 
and relief that women attribute to receiving a diagnosis (16, 17) and by a negative association 
between time to diagnosis and psychological wellbeing (15). 
There are many possible reasons for delayed diagnosis (22). There is no single diagnostic 
test, different sets of diagnostic criteria are still used, individual diagnostic criteria lack clarity 
and exclusion of other etiologies is needed to establish the diagnosis of PCOS (4, 23, 24). 
Ovarian ultrasound examination may be a perceived barrier to patient evaluation for PCOS in the 
primary care community, however an accurate diagnosis of PCOS can be made without ovarian 
ultrasound if hyperandrogenism and menstrual irregularity are present (4, 23). Variations in 
PCOS features due to ethnic origin, genetic and environmental factors may also contribute to 
delayed diagnosis (25). PCOS is difficult to diagnose in adolescence as PCOS features can be 
similar to normal pubertal development (26). Adolescents and women may seek care for their 
presenting symptoms from different disciplines (e.g. a dermatologist for hirsutism and acne, a 
gynecologist for irregular menses, and a psychologist for depression) and if a woman’s care is 
not coordinated, the accurate diagnosis of PCOS may not be made (22). Given these challenges, 
comprehensive care for PCOS in a multidisciplinary setting is widely advocated, although not 
received by most women (12, 22, 27). 
Timely diagnosis enables early interventions for acne, hirsutism, menstrual irregularity, 
anxiety, depression, and provision of counselling regarding future fertility. As quality of life is 
linked to the clinical features of PCOS (28), early diagnosis and intervention are important. 
Timely diagnosis is also important for engaging women in lifestyle management early in the life-
course to prevent weight gain, obesity and related metabolic complications. Prevention of weight 
gain is recommended in PCOS position statements and guidelines (29, 30) and is more feasible at 
the individual level than weight loss (31). At the systems level, weight gain prevention programs 
are likely to require fewer resources than weight loss programs (32). Also from a resource 
allocation perspective, the financial costs related to diagnosis of PCOS are only a small fraction 
(2%) of the total costs associated with comprehensive care for PCOS in the USA (33).  
The reported delays in diagnosis suggest missed opportunities to optimize treatment, improve 
quality of life and prevent weight gain. We suggest that greater community and clinician 
awareness about the full range of PCOS features is needed internationally to facilitate early 
diagnosis. 
Information provision at diagnosis 
Few women were satisfied with information about PCOS given at diagnosis, including on 
lifestyle management and medical therapy. Additionally, over half the women reported not 
receiving information about long-term complications or emotional support/counselling. Women 
in Europe were particularly likely to report a lack of information provision. Yet we report the 
desire for good-quality information regarding the full range of PCOS features and co-morbidities 
at the time of diagnosis for women around the world. These findings are supported by previous 
research from the USA, UK and Australia reporting women’s desire for more information across 
the full range of PCOS features (34). This desire for information at diagnosis suggests an 
opportune time to initiate behavior change, with enhanced knowledge of PCOS associated with

increased engagement with lifestyle management (16) and better quality information about 
PCOS associated with better quality of life (19).  
Women report gaining some or most of their information about PCOS from specialists and 
the internet (18, 19, 34) and that the quality of available PCOS information varies (17, 19, 34). 
Professional societies in Australia, North America and Europe produce freely available PCOS 
information sheets for patients, yet the findings presented here suggest these are underutilized by 
health professionals. Investigating health professional awareness of accessible resources and 
practices regarding PCOS consumer information could identify barriers to optimal information 
dissemination. Content or format of available resources may also not adequately address 
women’s concerns about PCOS. Clearly co-developed information for women covering the 
diversity of PCOS features is needed internationally. 
Key concerns about PCOS 
Women identified difficulty losing weight, irregular menstrual cycles, infertility and hirsutism as 
their four key concerns about PCOS. This finding is consistent with previous research (16, 18, 
34) and with the domains of the PCOS health-related quality of life questionnaire (PCOSQ) (35). 
Our study is the first international study in this area and also reports associations between 
concerns, age and world region. Concerns about weight management also once again highlight 
the need for health professionals to deal with lifestyle and excess weight management. Concerns 
with reproductive and metabolic features reflect the different clinical implications of PCOS 
across the life-course, and the importance of understanding PCOS as a long-term, multi-system 
condition. Clinicians need to ensure that personalized histories elicit individual concerns to guide 
comprehensive care. 
Associations were also noted between world regions and concerns about PCOS. These 
observations may reflect differences in symptom experience in different cultures or ethnicities, 
differences in obesity prevalence, availability of local consumer education resources or health 
professional knowledge of PCOS. For example, women in Europe were less likely to have 
concerns about difficulties losing weight and insulin resistance than women in North America, 
likely related to prevalent overweight, obesity and diabetes in the USA (36, 37). Women in 
Europe were more likely to be concerned about clinical hyperandrogenism and anxiety or 
depression. This is in addition to reporting receiving less information about medical therapy and 
emotional support at diagnosis. Evidence-based PCOS resources for consumers and health 
professionals should be tailored to different geographic regions and should address the gaps 
identified above. 
Support needs 
Women indicated that they wish to be supported in a range of ways: broadly available 
educational material, patient forums and workshops, and internet-based information. Supporting 
women through a range of modalities is also likely to be beneficial for engagement in lifestyle 
management and preventive strategies. In particular, previous reports suggest that online support 
groups help women to build confidence in communicating with health professionals and 
improving self-management (38). Our findings support prior recommendations to provide 
women with a set of resources at the time of diagnosis that includes information on PCOS 
features and management, contact details of a PCOS support group and a list of websites that 
contain good quality, evidence-based information (17).

Limitations and strengths 
The diagnosis of PCOS in our survey participants was based on self-reported medical diagnosis 
only and we did not attempt to identify specific PCOS phenotypes. However, recent genetic 
analyses have found the same PCOS susceptibility loci in self-reported and rigorously diagnosed 
women with PCOS (39, 40). The questionnaire has not been validated against women’s medical 
records relating to diagnosis as it is designed to investigate the perceived experience not as an 
audit tool. Recall bias is possible as women were asked about events that, for some participants, 
occurred a number of years ago. However, regression analyses relating to diagnosis experience 
were adjusted for time since diagnosis. Selection bias is possible and the sample may not be 
representative of the general population of women with PCOS. The questionnaire was only 
available in English and on two English language websites. This will have limited the 
participation of women from non-English speaking backgrounds. Limited conclusions can be 
drawn regarding the ‘other world regions’ group as it is a small and heterogeneous sample. The 
data is presented here for completeness, but we note it is largely consistent with the North 
American and European data and with previous research (14). Research using translated versions 
of the questionnaire is underway to better understand diagnosis experience in culturally and 
linguistically diverse groups of women. Despite these limitations, this is the largest and most 
comprehensive study to specifically explore the PCOS diagnosis experience and related issues. 
Additional strengths include its internationally recruited, community-based sample, which 
enabled multivariable regression analysis to somewhat take into account differences in health 
care system organization and cultural differences between North America and Europe. This 
broad investigation provides a foundation for further research to investigate the contributors to, 
and impact of, diagnosis experience in specific countries. 
Conclusion 
In the largest and only international study of PCOS diagnosis experiences, delayed diagnosis is 
common and associated with poor patient experience in women with PCOS worldwide. There 
are clear opportunities for improving awareness among women and health professionals to 
improve timely diagnosis. Current consumer information needs are not being met by existing 
educational resources and lack of awareness, accessibility and suitability of resources may all be 
contributors. Women’s concerns around PCOS vary across world regions and across the lifespan, 
highlighting the need to prioritize women’s individual concerns as part of PCOS management. 
Excess weight was the primary health concern emphasizing the need to address lifestyle and 
weight management for women with PCOS. Overall women are seeking information and support 
across a range of modalities. Taken together these findings are concerning for both affected 
women and their health care providers. They also inform an initiative to develop international 
evidence-based guidelines, co-designed consumer and health professional resources and 
international dissemination to improve diagnosis experience, education, management and health 
outcomes.
