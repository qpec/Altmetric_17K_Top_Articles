Medicinal honey research is undergoing a substantial renaissance. From a folklore
remedy largely dismissed by mainstream medicine as “alternative”, we now see
increased interest by scientists, clinical practitioners and the general public in the
therapeutic uses of honey. There are a number of drivers of this interest: fi
rst, the
rise in antibiotic resistance by many bacterial pathogens has prompted interest in
developing and using novel antibacterials; second, an increasing number of reliable
studies and case reports have demonstrated that certain honeys are very effective
wound treatments; third, therapeutic honey commands a premium price, and the honey
industry is actively promoting studies that will allow it to capitalize on this; and fi
nally,
the very complex and rather unpredictable nature of honey provides an attractive
challenge for laboratory scientists. In this paper we review manuka honey research,
from observational studies on its antimicrobial effects through to current experimental
and mechanistic work that aims to take honey into mainstream medicine. We outline
current gaps and remaining controversies in our knowledge of how honey acts, and
suggest new studies that could make honey a no longer “alternative” alternative.

INTRODUCTION
Honey has been used as a medicine throughout the history of the human race. One of
the most common and persistent therapeutic uses of honey has been as a wound dressing,
almost certainly due to its antimicrobial properties. With the advent of highly active antibiotics
in the 1960s, honey was dismissed as a “
worthless but harmless substance” (Soffer, 1976).
However, the current and growing crisis of antibiotic resistance has revived interest in the use
of honey, both as an effective agent in its own right and as a therapeutic lead to develop
new methods of treatment. Honey is usually derived from the nectar of flowers and produced
by bees, most commonly the European honey bee Apis mellifera, and is a complex mix of
sugars, amino acids, phenolics, and other substances. Honey types derived from different
flowering plants vary substantially in their ability to kill bacteria, and this has complicated
the literature on honey and made it sometimes difficult to reproduce results across different
studies (Allen et al., 1991; Irish et al., 2011). The majority of recent studies investigating

Manuka Honey Research
the mechanism of action of honey have focused on well-
characterized, standardized active manuka honey produced by
certain Leptospermum species native to New Zealand and
Australia, which has been registered as a wound care product with
appropriate medical regulatory bodies. Thus, unless otherwise
specified, this review will focus on manuka honey.
CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF ACTIVE
MANUKA HONEY
Professor Peter Molan of Waikato University, New Zealand,
was the first to report the unusual activity of manuka honey
and began testing its action against a wide range of different
bacterial species in the mid 1980s. However, while it was clear
that even low concentrations of manuka honey killed bacterial
pathogens, the specific active ingredient responsible for this
remained elusive for many years. High sugar and low pH make
honey inhibitory to microbial growth, but activity remains when
these are diluted to negligible levels. Many different types of
honey also produce hydrogen peroxide when glucose oxidase,
which is derived from the honey bee, reacts with glucose and
water. However, in manuka honey hydrogen peroxide production
is relatively low and can be neutralized by catalase, yet activity
still remains. The cause of this remaining activity, dubbed “
non-
peroxide activity”or NPA, was finally revealed in 2008, when
two laboratories independently identified methyl glyoxal (MGO)
in manuka honey (Adams et al., 2008; Mavric et al., 2008).
MGO results from the spontaneous dehydration of its precursor
dihydroxyacetone (DHA), a naturally occurring phytochemical
found in the nectar of flowers of Leptospermum scoparium,
Leptospermum polygalifolium, and some related Leptospermum
species native to New Zealand and Australia (Adams et al.,
2009; Williams et al., 2014; Norton et al., 2015). MGO can
react relatively non-specifically with macromolecules such as
DNA, RNA and proteins (Adams et al., 2008; Mavric et al.,
2008; Majtan et al., 2014b), and could theoretically be toxic to
mammalian cells (Kalapos, 2008). However, there is no evidence
of damage to host cells when manuka honey is either consumed
orally or used as a wound dressing; indeed honey appears to
stimulate healing and reduce scarring when applied to wounds
(Biglari et al., 2013; Majtan, 2014; Dart et al., 2015). How it
exerts this apparently selective toxicity to bacterial cells is not
known.
High levels of MGO or hydrogen peroxide usually produce
the most active honey, however, the correlation is not always
perfect suggesting other components of honey may modulate
activity (Molan, 2008; Kwakman et al., 2011; Chen et al.,
2012; Lu et al., 2013). Bee defensin-1, an antimicrobial bee-
derived peptide is responsible for activity in Revamil honey,
an active honey produced from an undisclosed source, but this
appears to be structurally modified and inactive in manuka
honey (Kwakman et al., 2011; Majtan et al., 2012). The level of
leptosin, a glycoside found exclusively in Leptospermum honey,
correlates with potency and may modulate the antimicrobial
activity of manuka honey (Kato et al., 2012). Similarly, various
phenolic compounds with potential antimicrobial activity can
be present, particularly in darker colored honeys, and although
these occur at levels that are unlikely to be inhibitory on their
own they may synergize with one another or other components
of honey to produce or alter activity (Estevinho et al., 2008;
Stephens et al., 2010). Phenolics can also act as antioxidants and
may be responsible for anti-inflammatory and wound-healing
properties of honey (Stephens et al., 2010). It should be noted
that not all Leptospermum species produce active honey, and even
within L. scoparium and L. polygalifolium honey MGO levels
can range from ∼100 to >1200 ppm (Windsor et al., 2012).
A survey of Australian honey activity found honey sourced from
Leptospermum plants growing around the New South Wales–
Queensland border was particularly active, but whether this is due
to plant, soil, climate or other factors is not known (Irish et al.,
2011).
THE INHIBITION OF PATHOGENS BY
HONEY
Honey has been tested in vitro on a diverse range of pathogens,
particularly those that can colonize the skin, wounds and mucosal
membranes, where topical honey treatment is possible. To
date, in vitro assays have found manuka honey can effectively
inhibit all problematic bacterial pathogens tested (summarized
in Table 1). Of particular interest is that clinical isolates with
multiple drug resistance (MDR) phenotypes have no reduction
in their sensitivity to honey, indicating a broad spectrum of
action that is unlike any known antimicrobial (Willix et al., 1992;
Blair and Carter, 2005; George and Cutting, 2007; Tan et al.,
2009). In addition, attempts to generate honey-resistant strains
in the laboratory have not been successful and there have been no
reports of clinical isolate with acquired resistance to honey (Blair
et al., 2009; Cooper et al., 2010).
As well as inhibiting planktonic cells, honey can disperse
and kill bacteria living in biofilms. Biofilms are communities of
cells that are generally enclosed in a self-produced extracellular
matrix and found adhering to surfaces, including wounds, teeth,
mucosal surfaces, and implanted devices. Microbes resident
in biofilms are protected from antimicrobial agents and they
can cause persistent, non-resolving infections. Manuka honey
disrupts cellular aggregates (Maddocks et al., 2012; Roberts
et al., 2012) and prevents the formation of biofilms by a wide
range of problematic pathogens, including Streptococcus and
Staphylococcus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli,
Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii,
and Klebsiella pneumonia (Maddocks et al., 2012, 2013; Lu et al.,
2014; Majtan et al., 2014a; Halstead et al., 2016) Importantly,
honey can also disrupt established biofilms and kill resident
cells, although a higher concentration is required than for
planktonic cells (Okhiria et al., 2009; Maddocks et al., 2013; Lu
et al., 2014; Majtan et al., 2014a). Very recently, manuka honey
was tested on a multispecies biofilm containing Staphylococcus
aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Enterococcus faecalis and was found to reduce viability of all
species but E. faecalis, which could not be eradicated (Sojka et al.,
2016). This has clear clinical implications for using honey on

wounds containing biofilms, and understanding how the biofilm
enables E. faecalis, to survive when it is normally killed by
honey is an important and interesting area of future study. MGO
appears to be mostly but not fully responsible for the inhibition of
biofilms by manuka honey, again highlighting the importance of
additional components that modulate activity (Kilty et al., 2011;
Lu et al., 2014).
The spectrum of activity of honey toward non-bacterial
pathogens is yet to be well established. Recent studies examining
the antiviral effect of manuka honey have suggested it has
potential for treatment of varicella-zoster virus (the cause of
chicken pox and shingles) (Shahzad and Cohrs, 2012) and
influenza (Watanabe et al., 2014). Fungal pathogens of the
skin, including Candida albicans and dermatophyte species are
substantially less susceptible than bacteria to manuka honey, but
are inhibited by honey with high levels of hydrogen peroxide
production (Brady et al., 1996; Irish et al., 2006). Manuka and
non-manuka honey have been found to reduce the viability
of spores of the microsporidian Nosema apis, an important
pathogen of bees, but honey could not cure bee infection once
this was underway (Malone et al., 2001). There have been very few
studies on the use of honey for protozoan or helminth parasites
and these have not used honey with well-characterized activity,
making it difficult to assess the significance of their findings
(Bassam et al., 1997; Nilforoushzadeh et al., 2007; Sajid and Azim,
2012).
TAKING HONEY INTO MAINSTREAM
MEDICINE: RECENT EXPERIMENTAL
AND MECHANISTIC STUDIES SHED
LIGHT ON HOW HONEY WORKS
Active manuka honey is widely available as a therapeutic agent
and functional food, and most consumers accept it as a holistic,
somewhat mysterious product. However, a lack of understanding
on how honey kills bacteria and promotes healing limits its
acceptance by mainstream medicine where it is still considered
“
alternative”or “
complementary”
. The vast majority of research
studies on honey to date have been descriptive, however, recent
studies are attempting to unravel how honey works and are using
mechanistic approaches to determine how it acts at the cellular
and the molecular level.
ULTRASTRUCTURAL STUDIES OF
BACTERIAL CELLS AND COMMUNITIES
TREATED BY HONEY
Honey can profoundly alter the size and shape of bacterial cells,
although the extent of this varies in different bacterial species.
Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), S. aureus
cultures treated with manuka honey had more cells with
completed septa compared to those treated with artificial honey,
suggesting cells entered but failed to complete the division stage
of the cell cycle, although externally these cells appeared normal
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Henriques et al., 2010).
More recently, phase-contrast imaging following treatment with
a sub-lethal dose of manuka honey found cells of S. aureus and
Bacillus subtilis were significantly smaller and were more likely
to have condensed DNA than those growing without honey (Lu
et al., 2013). It is difficult to directly compare these studies as they
used different amounts of honey and treatment times, but overall
the results suggest an uncoupling of growth and cell division,
which is often seen in response to nutritional and environmental
stresses (Silva-Rocha and de Lorenzo, 2010).
Honey treatment has been reported to cause cultures of
the Gram negative species E. coli and P. aeruginosa to have
both abnormally shorter and longer cells (Lu et al., 2013).
Interestingly, while P. aeruginosa appears to be less susceptible to
inhibition by honey than other species, profound cellular changes
were seen using TEM and SEM, including furrows and blebs
(protrusions of cellular plasma membranes) on the cell surface
and a substantial amount of extracellular debris indicative of cell

lysis (Henriques et al., 2011). This was verified in a subsequent
study using BacLight live-dead fluorescence staining and confocal
microscopy, although this also demonstrated that a relatively
large number of live cells remained. These studies used 20%
(w/v) honey, which was higher that the MBC for their strain
of P. aeruginosa and substantial inhibition and death would
be expected. However, atomic force microscopy (AFM) using
sub-bactericidal levels still found substantial cell distortion and
blebbing in cells treated with MIC (12%) and half MIC (6%)
concentrations, along with substantial cell lysis (Roberts et al.,
2012). This apparent degeneration of the P. aeruginosa cell was
supported by quantitative PCR analysis that showed a 10-fold
down-regulation in honey-treated cells of oprF, which encodes an
outer-membrane porin that is important for structural stability
(Jenkins et al., 2015a).
‘OMICS ANALYSES ASSESS THE
WHOLE-CELL RESPONSE TO
INHIBITION BY HONEY
The ability to assess whole cell outputs has revolutionized the
study of drug-pathogen interactions and has particular value
for complex natural products like honey where effects on
multiple processes are likely. Microarray and proteomic studies
of bacteria exposed to honey suggested an induction of stress-
related processes and suppression of protein synthesis (Blair
et al., 2009; Jenkins et al., 2011; Packer et al., 2012). While
overall this is fairly typical of a response to inhibitory agents,
honey produced a unique “
signature”of differential expression
that included many proteins with hypothetical or unknown
functions, suggesting a novel mode of action. Specific genes
or proteins found to be down-regulated in ‘
omics analyses
of S. aureus and E. coli O157/H7 have functions relating to
virulence, quorum sensing and biofilm formation (Lee et al.,
2011; Jenkins et al., 2013), and in P. aeruginosa there was a
down-regulation of proteins involved in flagellation (Roberts
et al., 2015). These phenotypes are critical for pathogens to
establish and produce invasive infection and indicate that as well
as inhibiting growth, honey can reduce the pathogenic potential
of infecting bacteria.
Although still relatively limited in number and scope, the
‘
omics analyses conducted to date suggest a complex cellular
response to honey with considerable variation in different
bacterial species. Advanced systems biology approaches that
allow contextualization of the data, and validation studies using
quantitative PCR and gene deletion strains, are now required to
unravel this complexity, and these may reveal new approaches
for drug therapies aimed at inhibiting bacterial growth (Hudson
et al., 2012).
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN HONEY AND
CONVENTIONAL ANTIBIOTICS
As well as use as a sole agent, there is scope for using honey
to augment treatment with conventional antibiotics. This may
have particular value when combined with systemic agents
that can be delivered to a wound bed via blood circulation
while honey is applied topically. Combined treatments can
also lower the therapeutic dose of antimicrobial agents and
prevent the development of resistance, and in some cases
can result in drug synergy, where the combined activity is
greater than the sum of the individual activities of each drug
partner.
In vitro studies combining therapeutically approved manuka
honey with antibiotic agents have found a synergistic effect
with oxacillin, tetracycline, imipenem and mupirocin against
the growth of an MRSA strain (Jenkins and Cooper, 2012).
Furthermore, the presence of a sub-inhibitory concentration of
honey in combination with oxacillin restored the MRSA strain
to oxacillin susceptibility. The authors found down-regulation
of mecR1, which encodes an MRSA-specific penicillin-binding
protein (PBP2A) and suggested this as a mechanism of honey
synergy. Strong synergistic activity between manuka honey and
rifampicin against multiple S. aureus strains, including clinical
isolates and MRSA strains, has also been found, and the presence
of honey prevented the emergence of rifampicin resistance
in vitro (Müller et al., 2013). This is of clinical significance
as rifampicin penetrates well into tissues and abscesses and is
commonly used to treat superficial staphylococcal infections,
but rapidly induces resistance and must therefore be used in
combination with another agent. An additional finding from
this study was that synergy was not due to MGO, as a
synthetic honey spiked with MGO was not synergistic with
rifampicin.
Understanding how honey affects the action of antimicrobials
with well-characterized modes of action may also further our
understanding of how honey affects bacterial pathogens. Liu et al.
(2014) extended the analysis of synergy to include additional
antibiotics and different S. aureus and MRSA strains. They
suggested that an increased susceptibility to clindamycin and
gentamicin might result from the combined effect of down-
regulated protein synthesis by honey with inhibition of ribosomes
by the antibiotics, while synergy with β-lactam antibiotics could
be due to increased oxidative stress caused by both partners.
As S. aureus and MRSA strains were equally susceptible to
the oxacillin-honey combination it appeared that synergy was
unlikely to be due to PBP2A down-regulation. In one clinical
MRSA isolate, however, there was no increase in sensitivity to
clindamycin or gentamicin when honey was present, which is
notable as it is the first reported case of a difference in response
to honey by MRSA versus S. aureus. Investigating this strain-
specific difference using transcriptomic or proteomic analyses
would be an interesting avenue for future research (Liu et al.,
2014).

models to study infections and wound healing. Manuka honey
has, however, been used to treat animals with surgical or
accidental wounds, particularly horses, with positive outcomes
(Dart et al., 2015; Bischofberger et al., 2016). Case reports
using honey for non-healing wounds and ulcers have noted
significant improvement with resolution of infection where
conventional antibiotics had failed (Regulski, 2008; Smith et al.,
2009). However, despite this and the evidence from numerous
in vitro and in vivo models that honey kills problematic
wound pathogens, there is a paucity of robust clinical data for
manuka honey. There are various reasons for this, including
technical difficulties in performing a double-blind placebo-
controlled trial on a distinctive substance like honey, ethical
considerations, lack of interest by clinical practitioners and
cost-versus-benefit to honey companies, whose focus is on

GAPS AND EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES
IN THE STUDY OF HONEY
Great progress has been made recently in our understanding
of therapeutic honey, yet its use in clinical medicine remains
limited, even when conventional antibiotics are starting to
fail. The complexity in honey, which is arguably its greatest
strength in killing diverse pathogens and preventing resistance,
complicates its study as many factors working together are likely
to affect activity. We advocate further mechanistic studies using
appropriately registered therapeutic manuka honey, in particular
studies that use non-reductionist systems biology approaches,
along with detailed chemical and microbiological analyses to
elucidate how honey acts at the molecular, cellular and population
level, how this can differ in different strains and species of
microbial pathogens, and how the host cell responds (Table 2).
Information gained from these studies can then inform therapy
and produce the clinical data required to take honey into
mainstream medicine; no longer the alternative therapy used only
when all else has failed.
