Burden of disease in Brazil, 1990–2016: a systematic 
subnational analysis for the Global Burden of Disease 
Study 2016
GBD 2016 Brazil Collaborators*
Summary
Background Political, economic, and epidemiological changes in Brazil have affected health and the health system. We 
used the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) results to understand changing health patterns and inform 
policy responses.
Methods We analysed GBD 2016 estimates for life expectancy at birth (LE), healthy life expectancy (HALE), all-cause 
and cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs), and risk factors for Brazil, its 26 states, and the Federal District from 1990 to 2016, and compared these with 
national estimates for ten comparator countries.
Findings Nationally, LE increased from 68·4 years (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 68·0–68·9) in 1990 to 75·2 years 
(74·7–75·7) in 2016, and HALE increased from 59·8 years (57·1–62·1) to 65·5 years (62·5–68·0). All-cause age-
standardised mortality rates decreased by 34·0% (33·4–34·5), while all-cause age-standardised DALY rates decreased 
by 30·2% (27·7–32·8); the magnitude of declines varied among states. In 2016, ischaemic heart disease was the 
leading cause of age-standardised YLLs, followed by interpersonal violence. Low back and neck pain, sense organ 
diseases, and skin diseases were the main causes of YLDs in 1990 and 2016. Leading risk factors contributing to 
DALYs in 2016 were alcohol and drug use, high blood pressure, and high body-mass index.
Interpretation Health improved from 1990 to 2016, but improvements and disease burden varied between states. An 
epidemiological transition towards non-communicable diseases and related risks occurred nationally, but later in 
some states, while interpersonal violence grew as a health concern. Policy makers can use these results to address 
health disparities.

Introduction
Brazil has undergone important structural and economic 
changes over the past 50 years. 21 years of military 
dictatorship came to an end in 1985, and in 1988, a 
Constitutional Assembly edited a new constitution 
establishing health as a “right for all” and a “duty of 
the state”, leading to health care reforms to create the 
universal Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS).1,2 
National immunisation programmes have provided 
vaccines to all citizens since 1973,3 and since 1994, 
the Estratégia Saúde da Família4 (ESF–Family Health 
Strategy) has reorganised primary health services to 
guarantee universal access, improve health education, and 
increase health promotion. These reforms have taken 
place within an increasingly urban and globalised national 
context that has shifted social structures and further 
affected patterns of disease. Improvements in health 
outcomes from communicable diseases have been one 
notable result of the reforms, while the growing burden of 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) presents a new 
challenge.5 Industrial 
isation, urbanisation, eco 
nomic 
growth, changes in income inequality, and the introduction 
of national and community health programmes are among 
the factors that have spurred declines in mortality and 
fertility in Brazil,1,6,7 and the subsequent expansion of the 
older population and decreasing population in the labour 
force demand new policies for health and social security.8,9 
High levels of violence, fuelled in part by the illegal drug 
trade, present another important health challenge.10,11
Geographically disaggregated data for health out-
comes12–15 have allowed policy makers in many countries 
to better understand and allocate resources towards 
domestic health problems. Brazil is home to 209·8 million 
citizens living in 26 states and the Federal District; the 
population of the state of São Paulo alone, at 45·4 million, 
is greater than the total population of neighbouring 
Argentina. The states are grouped into five geographic 
macro-regions: 
the 
north, 
northeast, 
central-west, 
southeast, and south. States in the regions of the south 
and southeast, which include the major cities of São Paulo 
and Rio de Janeiro, are generally more urban and 
industrialised, with better infrastructure, compared with 
states in the regions of the north and northeast.1

on population and Socio-demographic Index (SDI). 
Demographic and epidemiological changes in Brazil have 
not been experienced uniformly across states, resulting in 
subnational disparities in health and corresponding 
burdens on health systems.
Here we provide analyses of patterns of disease, 
disability, and related risk factors in Brazil, its states, and 
the Federal District to present the current picture of 
disease burden contrasted with ten comparator countries. 
Understanding health patterns over the past 26 years 
at regional and state levels will allow decision makers 
to better plan health policies, assess the effect of 
programmes, and allocate finances.
Methods
Overview
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) 
estimated disease burden due to 333 diseases and injuries, 
2982 unique sequelae, and 84 risk factors for 195 countries 
and territories from 1990 to 2016. All metrics were 
estimated separately for Brazil’s 26 states and the Federal 
District and are presented with their 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs). All rates presented are age-standardised per 
100 000 population calculated using the world standard 
population developed for the GBD16,17 unless otherwise 
specified. We applied the GBD star rating system to assess 
data completeness from 1980 to 2016 at the state level, as 
shown in table 1. A complete list of data sources used 
to produce Brazil estimates of cause-specific mortality, 
morbidity, and risk factors is available in the appendix (p 1).
Additional results can be explored using online data 
visualisation tools (now available in Portuguese) and 
downloaded using a query tool. Subnational data will 
also be available from the Institute for Scientific and 
Technological Communication and Information on Health 
(Icict/Fiocruz). This study complies with the Guidelines 
for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting 
(GATHER; appendix p 60).18 Analyses were done with 
Python (versions 2.5.4 and 2.7
.3), Stata (version 13.1), or 
R (version 3.1.2), and statistical code is available online. 
A comprehensive description of data sources, quality, and 
modelling for GBD 2016 has been reported elsewhere.5,17,19–22
A network of Brazilian researchers and health workers 
collaborated with the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation (IHME; Seattle, WA, USA) to provide national 
and subnational data; assist in scientific literature 
reviews; analyse results; and translate visualisation tools. 
Previously, these efforts resulted in the publication of a 
special article in Portuguese on the burden of selected 
diseases as estimated in GBD 2015, as a supplement of 
the journal Revista Brasileira de Epidemiologia.23
Mortality, causes of death, and years of life lost
We estimated all-cause mortality rates for each age-sex-
location-year using multistage models of adult and 
under-5 mortality and the GBD model life table system.17 
Cause-specific mortality rates were computed using 
the GBD cause-of-death database and, in most cases, the 
cause-of-death ensemble model (CODEm)15 as previously 
described.5,17 The quality of each data source was 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016) reported 
on 333 causes of disease and injury in 195 countries and 
territories from 1990 to 2016. Previous versions of the GBD 
were published for 1990, 2010, 2013, and 2015. GBD 2015 
provided subnational estimates for Brazil’s 26 states and the 
Federal District for the first time. In May, 2017, a supplement of 
the journal Revista Brasileira de Epidemiologia presented the 
burden of selected diseases in Brazil based on the results of 
GBD 2015, thanks to the GBD Brazil Network of researchers, 
created by the GBD Brazil Project, an agreement between the 
Ministry of Health, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), 
and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) of 
the University of Washington (WA, USA).
Added value of this study
The GBD 2016 estimation of mortality, years of life lost, years 
lived with disability, disability-adjusted life-years, healthy life 
expectancy, and risk factors built on the evidence base 
published in GBD 2015, including estimates for an additional 
18 causes of death and non-fatal disease. Substantial 
methodological improvements were made to provide the most 
accurate estimates available. Our study analysed subnational 
estimates for Brazil’s 26 states and the Federal District, 
providing a detailed and nuanced picture of health in Brazil by 
geographical region for the first time. We used the GBD 
summary metric of Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a combined 
measure of average years of schooling above age 15 years, total 
fertility rate, and income per capita, to further assess whether 
health outcomes in Brazil were better or worse than would be 
expected based on SDI.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study provides the most comprehensive assessment to 
date of the levels and trends of disability and death in Brazil. 
While health outcomes have improved substantially since 
1990, improvements have not been consistent across the 
geographical regions of the country. While the burden of 
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases 
decreased, most of the disease burden at the national and state 
level is now due to non-communicable diseases. Road injuries 
and interpersonal violence are also responsible for a large 
portion of the national burden of disease. These data provide an 
opportunity for policy makers to target specific regions and 
health areas for improvement, as well to learn from those 
regions where health gains have been made.

assessed, and the International Classification of Diseases 
and Injuries (ICD; version 9 and 10) codes were mapped 
to the GBD 2016 cause list.5 The estimation process is 
described in greater detail in the appendix (p 69). We 
estimated years of life lost (YLLs) for each cause by 
location, age, sex, and year by multiplying each cause-
specific death by the normative standard life expectancy 
at each age.5
YLDs, DALYs, LE, and HALE
We calculated years lived with disability (YLDs) by 
multiplying the prevalence of each disease sequela by 
its disability weight, developed using population-based 
surveys, as described in the appendix (p 69) and 
elsewhere.16,19,24 Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a 
combined measure of health lost to fatal and non-fatal 
causes (appendix p 70), are calculated as the sum of YLLs 
and YLDs for each age-sex-location-year.20 The calculations 
for life expectancy at birth (LE) and maximum life 
expectancy at each age have been previously reported.17 
Healthy life expectancy (HALE) summarises overall 
population health accounting for length of life and level 
of health loss by age using YLD estimates and the GBD 
life tables, as previously described.20

For the GBD 2016 study, the percentage of well-certified deaths across the time series by location was assessed and assigned from 0 to 5 stars: 5 stars where percentage well certified equaled or exceeded 85%; 
4 stars for 65% to less than 85%; 3 stars for 35% to less than 65%; 1 star for greater than 0% to less than 10%; and 0 stars for 0% well certified. SDI=Socio-demographic Index.

were estimated for each risk-outcome pair. This process 
is explained in greater detail in the appendix (p 70) and in 
prior publications.21
SDI
The SDI is calculated as the geometric mean of rescaled 
values of income per capita, total fertility rate, and 
average educational attainment, as described in detail in 
the appendix (p 70) and elsewhere.5 The components of 
the SDI indicator are strongly correlated with health 
outcomes.
GBD star rating system
For GBD 2016, a star rating system from 0 to 5 was 
developed to assess the quality of cause of death data in 
each location-year. A higher star rating indicates greater 
completeness, availability, and detail of mortality data, 
as well as lower levels of garbage codes and fewer 
aggregated causes (these terms are described in greater 
detail in the methods appendix). The percentage of data 
well-certified indicates the percentage of total deaths 
for which the detailed cause of death was known, by 
location-year. Based on these metrics, Brazil was 
assigned four out of five stars in 2016, with 70·5% well-
certified data for the period 2010–2016. Star rankings of 
data quality in each state are shown in table 1. We have 
dropped every state-year of data with less than 50% data 
completeness or more than 50% of garbage codes in 
level 1 and level 2, which amounted to 27 state-years of 
data, all prior to 1998. All included sources were 
ultimately adjusted to 100% completeness, as described 
elsewhere.5
Benchmarking
We compared outcomes in Brazil (SDI 0·708) to 
outcomes in the emerging economies that constitute the 
BRICS group25 (Russia [SDI 0·832], India [SDI 0·584], 
China [SDI 0·727], and South Africa [SDI 0·734]), 
countries with similar socioeconomic status and/or 
geographic proximity in Latin America (Mexico 
[SDI 0·734], Argentina [SDI 0·761], and Colombia 
[SDI 0·707]), and select high-SDI countries with

Between 1990 and 2016, LE in Brazil increased by 
6·8 years, from 68·4 years (95% uncertainty interval 
[UI] 68·0–68·9) to 75·2 years (74·7–75·7; table 2). HALE 
increased by 5·7 years, from 59·8 (57·1–62·1) to 
65·5 (62·5–68·0). In 2016, the three states with the lowest 
LE were in the northeast region: Alagoas (73·5 years 
[72·3–74·8]), Pernambuco (73·6 years [72·2–74·8]), and 
Sergipe (73·8 years [72·7–75·1]) (table 3). However, 
between 1990 and 2016, Alagoas also had the largest 
increase in LE (9·5 years), with the smallest increases 
seen in Piauí (1·6 years) in the northeast and Amapá 
(1·8 years) in the north. The states with the highest LE in 
2016 were the Federal District (77·8 years [76·8–78·9]) in 
the central-west and Santa Catarina (76·2 years 
[75·0–77·2]) in the south (table 3).
Nationally, all-cause age-standardised mortality rates 
decreased by 34·0% (95% UI 33·4 to 34·5) between 
1990 and 2016, from 1116·6 deaths per 100 000 
(1098·9 to 1134·8) to 737·0 deaths per 100 000 
(719·6 to 756·3; table 2). The mortality rate decreased in 
all but one state (Piauí had a small but non-significant 
increase), while the magnitude of the declines differed 
between and within regions (table 3). The largest 
decreases were recorded among states in the south (from 
36·3% [29·4 to 42·2] in Rio Grande do Sul to 
40·1% [33·9 to 45·7] in Santa Catarina) and southeast 
(from 37·7% [31·3 to 43·4] in Espírito Santo to 
40·9% [36·1 to 45·8] in São Paulo), while the smallest

decreases were in states in the north (from 9·9% 
[0·3 to 19·2] in Amapá to 35·6% [28·7 to 41·8] in 
Rondônia) and northeast (from –1·5% [–11·4 to 8·3] in 
Piauí to 33·9% [27·1 to 40·2] in Alagoas).
Between 1990 and 2016, the age-standardised rate of 
YLLs decreased by 40·7% (95% UI 38·7 to 42·5) from 
29 348·3 YLLs per 100 000 (28   862·4 to 29 835·6) to 
17 412·9 YLLs per 100 000 (16 965·3 to 17 884·9; table 2). 
The leading cause of YLLs in 2016 was ischaemic heart 
disease, for which YLLs increased by 27·5% (22·5 to 32·7) 
from 1990, when it was the fourth leading cause 
(figure 1A). In 1990, the leading three causes of YLLs 
were diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections 
(LRIs), and neonatal preterm birth complications, which 
dropped to 39th, fifth, and tenth, respectively in 2016. 
Total YLLs due to interpersonal violence increased by 
42·4% (12·1 to 64·0), rising from the sixth leading cause 
in 1990 to the second in 2016, while total YLLs for road 
injuries rose from the fifth leading cause to the third 
leading cause. Total YLLs also increased for HIV
/AIDS 
and diabetes, among others. The age-standardised YLL 
rate of the ten leading causes in 2016 decreased over the 
period, with the exception of small and non-significant 
increases for interpersonal violence (1·5% [–20·1 to 17·2]) 
and Alzheimer’s disease (2·7% [–1·3 to 7·0]). When all 
causes were aggregated one level further, the leading 
cause of YLLs in 2016 was cardiovascular diseases, 
followed by neoplasms (cancers).
For males, the leading causes of age-standardised YLLs 
in 1990 were diarrhoeal diseases in the northeast and 
ischaemic heart disease in the rest of the country 
(figure 2). This pattern was similar for females in 1990, 
although diarrhoeal disease was the leading cause in 
additional states in the north (Amazonas and Pará), and 
stroke and LRIs were the leading causes in Espírito Santo 
and Roraima, respectively. In 2016, interpersonal violence 
was the top cause of YLLs for males in most states, in 
addition to ischaemic heart disease in five states and road 
injuries in Toncantins. For females in 2016, ischaemic 
heart disease was the leading cause in all states except 
Roraima, where LRIs remained the leading cause.
The age-standardised rate of YLDs decreased slightly 
from 1990 to 2016, by 3·0% (95% UI 2·4 to 3·8), from 
11 354·9 YLDs per 100 000 (8393·2 to 14 744·1) to 
11 011·7 YLDs per 100 000 (8174·7 to 14 312·0; table 2). The 
morbidity profile has not changed substantially in Brazil 
since 1990: many leading causes of YLDs are non-
communicable and chronic diseases (figure 1B). Low back 
and neck pain, skin diseases, and sense organ diseases 
such as hearing and vision loss were the main causes of 
YLDs in both 1990 and in 2016. Many diseases experi-
enced an increasing percentage change in total number 
of YLDs but a decreasing percentage change in age-
standardised YLD rates: low back and neck pain increased 
by 79·7% (74·4 to 84·8) in total YLDs and decreased by 
4·4% (3·3 to 5·6) in age-standardised YLD rate. For 
diabetes there was a 117·9% (106·1 to 129·2) increase in 
number of YLDs but a small and non-significant increase 
of 3·1% (–1·7 to 7·8) in age-standardised YLD rate. 
Decreases in age-standardised YLD rates occurred for 
iron-deficiency anaemia (–11·5% [95% UI –9·7 to –13·4]), 
diarrhoeal diseases (–18·2% [–16·1 to –20·3]), and asthma 
(–24·6% [–21·6 to –27·6]).
At the state level, the Federal District had the lowest 
age-standardised YLL rate (14 192·4 YLLs [95% UI 
12 937·9–15 388·2] per 100 000) in 2016, and the fifth lowest 
YLD rate (10 847·8 YLDs [8064·9–14 148·8] per 100 000), 
while São Paulo presented the second lowest age-
standardised YLL rate (15 717·4 YLLs [14 542·5–16 931·0] 
per 100 000), but was among the states with the highest 
YLD rates (11 163·5 YLDs [8290·0–14 475·9] per 100 000; 
table 3). The highest YLD and YLL rates occurred in states 
in the northeast: the highest YLD rate was in Pernambuco 
in 1990 and Maranhão in 2016, while Alagoas had the 
highest YLL rate in both 1990 and 2016.
During the same period, the age-standardised rate of 
DALYs for all causes decreased by 30·2% (95% UI 
27·7–32·8), from 40 703·2 (37 686·9–44 088·9) per 
100 000 to 28 424·7 (25 411·7–31 646·7) per 100 000 
(table 2). Declines in all-cause age-standardised DALY

rates occurred alongside rising SDI in Brazil, its states, 
and the Federal District (figure 3), and although states 
such as Piauí and Maranhão saw increases in DALY rates 
in some years in spite of rising SDI, many states had 
lower DALY rates than would be expected on the basis of 
SDI. The appendix (p 64) provides age-standardised 
DALY rates for leading GBD causes for Brazil and by 
state in 1990 and 2016.
Temporal changes in DALYs for NCDs, communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases, 
and injuries differed within Brazil. This is evident in the 
comparison between the states of Maranhão and 
São Paulo, which have the lowest and the highest SDI 
scores (SDI 0·60 and 0·76, respectively), excluding the 
Federal District (figure 4). Between 1990 and 2016, DALYs 
due to NCDs increasingly predominated in all settings, 
with the total number of DALYs increasing and age-
standardised rates decreasing, especially in São Paulo. 
With respect to CMNN diseases, total DALYs and crude 
DALY rates decreased sharply in Maranhão from 1990 to 
2016, and NCDs overtook CMNN diseases as the leading 
contributor to total and crude DALY rates in 1998. By 
2016, all DALY measures for CMNN diseases in Brazil, 
Maranhão, and São Paulo had declined to similar levels 
as for injuries, which were relatively lower and stable 
throughout the period.
In 1990, many leading risk factors in Brazil contributed 
to DALYs for CMNN diseases. Child and maternal 
malnutrition contributed the greatest percentage of 
DALYs for males and females in 1990 (20·7% [95% UI 
18·4–22·8] and 21·2% [18·7–24·0] respectively), and 
unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH) also 
contributed a large percentage (6·5% [5·1–7·7] for males 
and 6·7% [5·3–8·2] for females) (figure 5A and 5B). 
These risks contributed to DALYs from diarrhoeal 
diseases, lower respiratory and other common infectious 
diseases, and maternal and neonatal disorders. By 2016, 
these risk factors contributed a much smaller percentage 
of DALYs (4·5% [4·1–4·9] for males and 5·5% [5·0–6·0] 
for females for child and maternal malnutrition, 
0·8% [0·6–1·0] for males and 0·9% [0·9–1·1] for females 
for unsafe WASH; figures 5C and 5D).
In 2016, many leading risk factors were metabolic, 
reflecting the increasing predominance of NCDs as the 
cause of the disease burden. In 2016 for females, the top 
four risk factors were high body-mass index (BMI; 9·2% 
[95% UI 6·8–11·8] contribution to DALYs), high systolic 
blood pressure (8·2% [7·1–9·4]), dietary risks (6·7% 
[5·1–8·4]), and high fasting plasma glucose (6·2% 
[5·3–7·2]). For males, high systolic blood pressure 
was the second greatest contributor (8·6% [7·7–9·6]), 
followed by dietary risks (7·7% [6·0–9·4]), and high BMI 
(7·2% [4·9–9·6]). These risk factors contributed primarily 
to DALYs from cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and 
urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases, among others.
The behavioural risk factor of alcohol and drug use 
contributed to an increasing percentage of DALYs, 
especially for males, rising from 7·4% (95% UI 6·4–8·5) 
in 1990 to 12·2% (10·3–14·0) in 2016, when it was the 
leading risk factor for males. The percentage of DALYs 
contributed by tobacco decreased for both sexes, from 
8·5% (7·7–9·3) for males and 6·4% (5·7–7·2) for females 
in 1990 to 6·9% (6·2–7·7) and 5·5% (4·8–6·3), 
respectively, in 2016. Alcohol and drug use contributed 
primarily to NCD DALYs from self-harm and inter-
personal violence and mental and substance use 
disorders, as well as transport injuries, while tobacco 
mainly contributed to NCD DALYs from neoplasms, 
cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory diseases 
(figures 5C and 5D).
Compared with the high-income and Latin American 
comparator countries, Brazil had higher age-standardised 
rates of mortality, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs in 
1990 and 2016 (with the exception of YLDs in England in 
2016) and lower LE and HALE (table 2). Of the BRICS 
countries, Brazil had lower rates of mortality, YLLs, 
YLDs, and DALYs and higher LE and HALE than Russia, 
India, and South Africa in 1990 and 2016, with the 
exception of Russia in 1990, which had lower levels of 
YLLs and DALYs and higher HALE and LE in that year. 
China had lower LE and higher mortality, YLLs, and 
DALYs than Brazil in 1990, but had surpassed Brazil on 
all health measures except DALYs by 2016. The gap

between health outcomes in Brazil and Mexico and 
between Brazil and Argentina narrowed from 1990 to 
2016, as health outcomes improved in Brazil. The 
appendix shows the rank of top GBD causes of age-
standardised DALYs (p 66) and the ratio of observed to 
expected age-standardised DALY rates for leading GBD 
causes (p 67) in Brazil and comparator countries.
Discussion
Although health outcomes in Brazil improved overall 
between 1990 and 2016, these improvements were not 
sufficient to eliminate health inequities: the burden of 
disease is generally higher in the states of the north and 
northeast regions than in the south and southeast. Brazil 
has undergone an epidemiological transition, with 
increasing life expectancy and decreasing mortality—
largely attributable to declines in CMNN diseases—
taking place alongside an increasing NCD burden. 
States in the south and southeast seem to be in later 
stages of the epidemiological transition towards NCDs 
compared with states in the north and northeast, and 
some states in earlier stages of the transition are facing a 
double burden of CMNN diseases and NCDs, alongside 
a growing burden due to injuries across the country. 
Leading risk factors now contribute primarily to the 
NCD burden, and Brazil is also contending with 
increased burdens of violence and road traffic injuries. 
Although these growing burdens have not yet negatively 
affected trends in life expectancy, they may shape future 
patterns if not addressed.
Although health outcomes improved in states in the 
north and northeast, higher rates of YLLs and YLDs 
persist in many states in those regions compared with 
states in the south and southeast, and LE and HALE 
remain generally higher in the south and southeast. 
These results are likely to reflect overall socioeconomic 
improvements, as reflected in increasing SDIs across 
all states, that have not mitigated socioeconomic 
disparities in access to and quality of health care. Of 
note, the comparatively good health indicators observed 
in the Federal District may be partially explained by the 
fact that poorer communities and slums surrounding 
Brasilia are not included in the official district population 
counts. The significant gains in some northern states 
in LE and HALE led to greater convergence between 
regions; however, these gains primarily reflect a 
reduction in the burden of CMNN diseases rather than 
NCDs. Access to health care in Brazil has become more 
equal since 1998,26 which may have contributed to this 
convergence.
Access to health care improved with the creation of the 
tax-financed national unified health system (SUS).1

Under the SUS, coverage of public health interventions 
rapidly expanded, including immunisation, family 
planning, and prenatal and maternal care.1 The Family 
Health Strategy has been associated with reduced 
neonatal and child mortality even after accounting for 
the Bolsa Familia cash transfer programme, as well as 
with reduced mortality from stroke and heart disease.27,28 
Exclusive breastfeeding rates in children under 4 months 
also increased from 4% to 48% from the mid-1980s to the 
mid-2000s.29 However, the SUS is not the sole explana-
tion for improved health outcomes. Over the same 
period, Brazil experienced dramatic economic growth, 
accompanied by increases in the value of the mini-
mum wage and increasing wealth distribution.7,30 The

government also invested in education, social protection, 
and sanitation, all of which affect health and wellbeing. 
At the same time, the private health sector has played and 
continues to play a major role for those that can afford to 
use it, likely dictating some of the variation in health 
across populations.30
In 2016, more than 95% of children in Brazil received 
most scheduled childhood vaccinations, including vaccines 
for measles, rubella, and rotavirus.31,32 The successful 
expansion of coverage from 1990 has likely contributed 
greatly to the declines in vaccine preventable CMNN 
diseases and child mortality.33 However, high levels of 
preterm births in Brazil may be contributing to the large 
burden of YLLs from neonatal conditions.34,35 Improve-
ments to newborn care services may have partially offset 
this increasing burden, but more remains to be done.36–38 
Maintaining gains in infectious disease control will also be 
a challenge in the face of endemic and emerging vector-
borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and 
Zika virus.39 In addition, although Brazil has implemented 
numerous measures to combat HIV,40 including free 
universal access to essential medicines and antiretroviral 
treatment,41,42 the increasing number of YLLs due to HIV 
indicate a need for increased efforts.
Ischaemic heart disease and stroke have been the leading 
causes of death in Brazil since the end of the 1960s, due in 
part to lifestyle changes related to urbanisation and 
globalisation.43 The shift toward NCDs occurred earlier in 
the south and southeast, as high 
lighted by the distinct 
time trends in disease burden between Maranhão and 
São Paulo. However, many states in the north and 
northeast are moving towards similar trends for NCDs, 
and had the highest rates for important NCDs in 2016.44 
This indicates that states in the south and southeast have 
been able to improve health efforts to address the NCD 
burden, while states in the north and northeast have not 
yet been able to achieve the same success. Indeed, variation 
in NCD burden can occur within states and cities,45 and 
policies will need to address this diversity. Successful 
efforts to prevent and control NCDs might enable states in 
the north and northeast to avoid the pitfalls of the 
epidemiological transition towards chronic disease.
The increasing life expectancy in Brazil brings 
additional health challenges: as individuals live longer 
with some form of disability, rates of non-fatal health 
loss increase, resulting in an absolute expansion of 
morbidity.46 São Paulo is a particular example: the state 
had very low rates of YLLs in 2016 compared with others, 
but one of the highest rates of YLDs. Population ageing 
also partially explains the increases in total YLDs 
(due to a growing elderly population) experienced 
alongside decreases in age-standardised YLD rates for 
some diseases (due to declining disease incidence or 
prevalence). Overall, the burden of chronic conditions, 
such as diabetes and hypertension, is growing.44,47 
Interventions targeting risk factors for NCDs and other 
chronic diseases might help address this concern.
The risk landscape also shifted from CMNN diseases 
towards NCDs and, to a lesser extent, injuries. Controlling 
the growing NCD burden will require attention to diet 
and physical activity.47 The prevalence of obesity has 
increased by 60% among those aged 25 to 34 years since 
2006,48 and was 17% in 2016,49 even as some populations 
continue to suffer from undernutrition and mal 
nourish-
ment. The Brazilian Government has enacted some 
policies to combat these risks, including the Plano de 
Enfrentamento das DCNTs, the Nutritional Guidelines 
for the Brazilian Population, and the WHO Global 
Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, aiming to 
prevent obesity, tobacco use, and NCDs.43,50,51 Since 2006, 
a national system has monitored risk factors for NCDs 
through telephone interviews.49 In 2013, the National 
Health Survey showed that older age, less schooling, and 
the male sex were associated with less physical activity, 
prevalence of daily smoking, and low consumption 
of fruits and vegetables—highlighting the increased 
potential risk for this demographic.52,53
Many efforts have contributed to the decline in DALY 
rates from 1990 to 2016 and should be considered a 
priority, including improved access to primary care and 
care for related risk factors, such as hypertension; access 
to free or subsidised drugs for hypertension, diabetes, 
and asthma; and access to and prioritisation of care for 
acute cardiovascular events.4,54–56 Tackling ischaemic heart 
disease poses a double challenge to health systems: 
prevention must take place alongside improvements in 
health-care delivery, particularly in public hospitals.54 
Policies restricting salt could further reduce rates of 
cardiovascular disease and stroke.57 The potential impact 
of new technologies to detect and treat NCDs is also 
substantial.
Since 2006, the National Health Promotion Policy has 
introduced initiatives to reduce behavioural risk factors 
such as smoking.58,59 Despite being the second greatest 
producer of tobacco worldwide, Brazil’s “National 
Tobacco Control Program” has successfully reduced 
tobacco consumption,54 distinguishing Brazil from many 
other low-income and middle-income countries, which 
have seen increasing trends.60 However, rates declined 
more slowly for males and in lower socioeconomic 
populations,54 and rates of smoking are still much higher 
in males; overall, close to 4 million more males than 
females smoke in Brazil.61 Tobacco control efforts in 
Brazil have included national and state level smoke-free 
air laws; packaging, marketing, and age restrictions; 
minimum pricing and taxation; cessation treatment; and 
behaviour change campaigns.62,63 The success of these 
programmes, even when confronted with industry 
interests, indicates that Brazil could be well positioned to 
introduce similar fiscal policies and restrictions to reduce 
consumption of sugar, unhealthy foods, and alcohol.
Alcohol consumption, economic growth, and urban-
isation are among the factors that have contributed to the 
high DALY burden of road injuries in Brazil, particularly 
 Articles

among young males and their main victims, pedestrians.64,65 
The increasing use of motorcycles has also contributed.66,67 
Careless riding, speeding, and increased vulnerability of 
the driver and passenger have led to an increase in the 
number of motorcycle accidents, especially among young 
males.66 Motorcycle drivers are a priority for current injury 
prevention programmes.10,66 High DALY rates are likely 
due in part to rapid urbanisation, low quality of roads, and 
lack of access to and quality of health-care services, 
particularly in rural areas,68 potentially influencing the 
disparate rates between regions. Traffic safety laws, 
including car safety requirements and zero tolerance on 
alcohol consumption, have been introduced, but many 
individuals continue to self-report consumption levels 
above legal limits while driving.68
Alcohol also contributes to the DALY burden due to 
interpersonal violence, one of the leading causes of 
DALYs in 2016. Violence primarily affects younger 
individuals,10 thereby contributing to a higher number 
of YLLs and YLDs. Much of the interpersonal violence 
in Brazil is due to homicides with firearms related in 
part to drug trafficking, availability and circulation of 
illegal firearms, and consumption of alcohol and 
drugs.10,11 Mortality rates are especially high for young 
males, as is the case in other countries.17 Although rates 
remain high in Rio de Janeiro, they represent an 
impressive decline from 1990, in part due to national 
policies introduced in 2003 that restricted firearm 
ownership, carrying, and importation, and increased 
punishments for violations, alongside disarmament 
efforts.69,70 However, increases in the burden of in-
terpersonal violence in the majority of states indicate a 
potential disparity in policy enforcement, among other 
factors. The historic relationship between police, crime, 
and communities in Brazil is complex,10 and focusing 
on the top risk factors contributing to interpersonal 
violence—alcohol and drug use—could be a more 
productive way to address the problem than increased 
policing, particularly among males.71 However, efforts 
will also need to take into account the role of the drug 
trade, which has led to increased rates of violence across 
a belt of countries in Latin America, including 
comparators Mexico and Colombia.17,72
To continue to positively affect the changing health 
landscape, financing in Brazil must reflect the 
geographic-specific burden of disease and focus on 
“best buys” for NCD control.73 Public financing of the 
health system has been a constitutional right since 1988. 
Brazil’s investment in health has increased over the past 
20 years, and it currently invests US$947 per capita and 
8·3% of GDP in health.74 This is a much lower sum than 
countries with public health systems (eg, Australia and 
England) invest, but similar to investments made in 
Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico in recent years.74
The challenge ahead is to ensure that financial 
resources in Brazil are strategically allocated according to 
disease priorities in each state, region, sex, and age 
group. For example, although the burden of ischaemic 
heart disease is highest in the northeast region, 
inequalities exist in public financing of hospital ad-
missions for heart disease.54,75 In 2012, the median per 
capita outlay for adults aged 40 years or older in the 
northern and northeastern regions was $6·07 and 
$10·28, respectively; considerably less than the med-
ian per capita outlay in states of the southern region 
of $20·32.2
Finally, while increased funds are required to maintain 
gains and further improve health and equality, congress 
approved Constitutional Amendment 95 in December, 
2016, restricting funds allocated to the health sector and 
providing no real increase in health funding for the next 
20 years—until 2037
.76 This austerity has also extended to 
other sectors affecting health and wellbeing, including 
education and public utilities such as sanitation. These 
policies could stall the important progress that has been 
made over the past 26 years in Brazil, while the ultimate 
cost-saving potential of reducing deaths and injuries 
from violence, road injuries, and other diseases is 
considerable.10
Limitations and future directions
This study is subject to all the limitations of the GBD 
2016 study, which have been previously described.5,17,19–22 
Cause of death data completeness at the state level in 
Brazil is quite high, with all states receiving at least 
four stars in the period 2010 to 2016, and at least one state 
in each region receiving five stars (table 1). This 
represents a substantial improvement from 1980, when 
many states in the northeast had a rating of just two stars. 
Because our first cause of death data point in Tocantins is 
from 1993, Tocantins received zero stars for the periods 
1980–84 and 1985–89. Despite GBD methods to correct 
under-registered deaths, we dropped 27 years of state 
data prior to 1998 due to low completeness or low quality.
Data on morbidity in some northern states in 
1990 may not be reliable due to small population sizes 
(about 300 000) and poor information quality. Data from 
recent years are likely to be more reliable, but data 
sparsity and under-reporting or incorrect reporting of 
morbidity can present major challenges to the production 
of accurate estimates, particularly at the state level. For 
some causes of morbidity, we did not have data at the 
state level, and results for these causes were based on 
country or regional level results. Sparsity of survey data 
at the state level is the biggest challenge for risk factor 
and morbidity estimation.
The lack of a harmonised system to connect different 
data sources has impeded the comprehensive comparison 
of temporal trends and inter-region variability. Further 
research and increased data collection is needed to 
complete the picture of health in Brazil, particularly for 
conditions with very limited data, such as mental health. 
Improving the quality of registered data will also improve 
the validity of both national and GBD results, which have

not been extensively compared. Further research in this 
area can fill knowledge gaps and guide health system 
planning at the state level.
Conclusion
Brazil has improved population health over the past 
26 years despite an ageing population, increasing NCD 
burden, and rising costs of care. The public health system 
expanded, the economy grew, and policies were introduced 
focusing on risk factors for chronic diseases, prevention, 
and health promotion. The remaining challenge will be 
to address the growing NCD burden and remaining 
regional health inequalities. The current distribution of 
health resources must be realigned to efficiently address 
changing geographic-specific burdens. This study pre-
sents a thorough analysis of health inequalities and shows 
that overall, health outcomes are better in the south and 
southeast compared with the north and northeast. These 
findings can help to identify challenges, successes, and 
research gaps that policy makers can use to improve the 
health of all Brazilians and preserve gains in the face of 
rising poverty in the current recession.77
