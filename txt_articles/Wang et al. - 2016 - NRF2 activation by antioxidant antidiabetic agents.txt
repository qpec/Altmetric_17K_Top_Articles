Disclosure: The authors have nothing to disclose. 
 Abstract 
Cancer is a common comorbidity of diabetic patients; however, little is known about the effects 
that anti-diabetic drugs have on tumors. We discovered that common classes of drugs used in 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, the hypoglycemic dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) saxagliptin 
and sitagliptin, as well as the antineuropathic alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), do not increase tumor 
incidence but increase the risk of metastasis of existing tumors. Specifically, these drugs induce 
prolonged activation of the nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated antioxidant 
response via inhibition of KEAP1-C151-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of 
NRF2, resulting in up-regulated expression of metastasis-associated proteins, increased cancer 
cell migration, and promotion of metastasis in xenograft mouse models. Accordingly, 
knockdown of NRF2 attenuated naturally-occurring and DPP-4i-induced tumor metastasis, 
whereas NRF2 activation accelerated metastasis. Furthermore, in human liver cancer tissue 
samples, increased NRF2 expression correlated with metastasis. Our findings suggest that 
antioxidants that activate NRF2 signaling may need to be administered with caution in cancer 
patients, such as diabetic patients with cancer. Moreover, NRF2 may be a potential biomarker 
and therapeutic target for tumor metastasis.   
 Introduction 
Accumulating epidemiological evidence suggests that diabetes increases the risk of multiple 
cancers, including colon, liver, and breast cancers (1). Therefore, the increased prevalence of 
diabetes suggests that the incidence of individuals with both diabetes and cancer is also rising. 
Anti-diabetic drugs modulate glucose metabolism, the insulin-like growth factor-1 axis, or other 
factors associated with tumor initiation and progression, and therefore they may affect tumor 
behavior (1, 2). Moreover, because diabetic patients are chronically exposed to anti-diabetic 
drugs, this long-term exposure as well as drug accumulation resulting from compromised renal 
and hepatic functions commonly seen in these patients may amplify toxic effects of anti-diabetic 
drugs (3). Therefore, understanding the effects of anti-diabetic agents on tumor biology is 
indispensable for the development of specialized drug therapy that is safe to treat diabetic 
patients with cancer.  
Few studies have investigated the effects that anti-diabetic drugs have on tumors; some 
have suggested that anti-diabetic agents affect the incidence of cancer. Lewis and Piccinni 
reported a positive correlation between the dose and time of pioglitazone administration and 
bladder cancer risk (4, 5). Whether insulin analogs (especially glargine) increase cancer risk is 
currently controversial (6). On the other hand, metformin was found to reduce the risk of 
multiple cancers (such as breast, colon, and pancreatic cancers) and to inhibit the proliferation of 
cancer cells by activating the LKB1/AMPK pathway, indicating its potential as a cancer 
chemoprevention agent (7, 8). However, little is known about the effect of anti-diabetic agents 
on comorbid tumors in diabetic patients. To study the effects of anti-diabetic drugs on the 
biological behavior of existing tumors, we screened common clinical anti-diabetic agents such as 
metformin, various insulin analogs, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) in vitro. 
 Specifically, we assessed the proliferation and migration of different cancer cells after treatment 
with these drugs. We discovered that the DPP-4i saxagliptin (Sax), which is currently 
recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) as first-line 
hypoglycemic treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (9), potentially promoted migration 
of cancer cells. To clarify the correlation between DPP-4i and tumor metastasis and to reveal the 
mechanism underlying our preliminary observations, we further performed a series of in vitro 
and in vivo experiments. Here we report that DPP-4i Sax and sitagliptin (Sit), as well as alpha-
lipoic acid (ALA, an antioxidant used to treat diabetic neuropathy), promote tumor metastasis 
through activation of the nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-mediated antioxidant 
response, though they don’t increase tumor incidence. Additionally, NRF2 pathway activation 
correlated with tumor metastasis and may thus serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic 
target.  
 Results  
DPP-4i anti-diabetic treatment does not increase cancer risk  
Previous studies have suggested that anti-diabetic treatments may modify neoplastic risk factors 
or modulate existing tumors’ biological behavior. To examine the effect of DPP-4i on cancer 
risk, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials on DPP-4i up to July 2015. We 
did not find any correlation between DPP-4i monotherapy (saxagliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, 
linagliptin, or alogliptin; n=29, OR=0.80, 95% CI=0.52-1.24) or combinations with other anti-
diabetic drugs and total cancer incidence (n=88, OR=1.07, 95% CI=0.91-1.26). These results 
were consistent irrespective of the anti-diabetic drug used alone (table S1) or in combination 
(table S2). Specifically, DPP-4i treatment did not increase the risk of digestive (n=18, OR=0.89, 
95% CI=0.42-1.85), dermal (n=9, OR=1.05, 95% CI=0.40-2.71), or urological cancers (n=11, 
OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.38-2.37) (table S3), although previous studies reported that DPP-4i may be 
associated with increased incidence in these tumor types (10, 11). This meta-analysis suggests 
that DPP-4i alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs do not increase cancer risks.  
 
DPP-4i (Sax and Sit) enhance tumor metastasis 
Currently, it remains unclear whether DPP-4i treatment is detrimental to diabetic patients with 
existing tumors. To address this, we tested two DPP-4i compounds, Sax and Sit, with SW480, 
HCT116, and HuH-7 cancer cells and determined that within the therapeutic range (0.1 μM or 
0.6 μM, respectively), DPP-4 activity was inhibited (fig. S1). Sax and Sit did not affect cell 
proliferation (fig. S2A) or alter cancer cell sensitivity to cisplatin (fig. S2B). However, Sax and 
Sit markedly increased cell migration and invasion of multiple cancer cell lines (colon SW480 
and HCT116, hepatic HuH-7, breast MDA-MB-231, lung A549, ovary SKOV-3, and melanoma 
 A-375) (Fig. 1A) that represent common diabetic comorbidities (12). Similar results were 
obtained when various concentrations of Sax, Sit, and vildagliptin (Vil, another DPP-4i) were 
used (fig. S3). Next, we measured the expression of metastasis-associated proteins (HIF-1, COX-
2, and VEGF) (13, 14) and cancer type-specific metastasis proteins (BAMBI and APRIL for 
colon cancer, CORTACTIN for hepatocellular carcinoma) (15-17) in SW480, HCT116, and 
HuH-7 cell lines and found that Sax and Sit increased expression of these proteins (Fig. 1B). We 
also tracked HuH-7 cell migration with time-lapse microscopy (Fig. 1C) and observed greater 
persistence and forward migration index (FMI) after Sax and Sit treatment (Fig. 1D). These 
results indicate that Sax and Sit promote migration and invasion of various cancer cell lines. 
We further studied the effect of Sax and Sit on tumor metastasis in nude mice inoculated 
with HCT116-LUC+ or HuH-7-LUC+ cells (spontaneous and experimental metastatic models) 
(18). Sax- and Sit-treated mice showed obvious body weight losses during the course of the 
experiment (Fig. 1E) at doses that have been proven to not affect normal mouse weight (19). 
Bioluminescent imaging indicated that 6-week Sax and Sit treatment promoted metastatic 
capacity in both models (Fig. 1F). Histopathologic analyses revealed that livers and lungs of 
Sax- and Sit-treated mice had more visible metastatic nodules and micro-metastases detected by 
H&E and anti-VIMENTIN staining (Fig. 1G). We also observed higher expression of 
metastasis-associated proteins in the livers and lungs after 6-week Sax and Sit treatments (Fig. 
1H). Taken together, these results show that Sax and Sit enhance metastasis of existing tumors 
without increasing cancer risk. 
 DPP-4i activate NRF2 via KEAP1-C151-dependent inhibition of ubiquitination 
To understand how Sax and Sit promote tumor metastasis, we measured tumor progression-
associated factors such as lactate production, ATP metabolism, and oxidative stress (20-22). 
Neither intracellular nor secreted lactate (fig. S4A), nor ATP production (fig. S4B) were affected 
by treatment, but Sax and Sit greatly reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Fig. 
2A), increased GSH/GSSG ratios (Fig. 2B and fig. S5), and decreased 8-oxo-dG in cancer cells 
(Fig. 2C), suggesting that Sax and Sit may reduce oxidative stress in cancer cells. Furthermore, 
Sax- and Sit-induced cell migration and invasion were prevented by administration of buthionine 
sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of new glutathione synthesis, indicating that glutathione 
synthesis is required for the effects of Sax and Sit on tumor metastasis (fig. S6). Commonly, 
ROS concentrations are suppressed by activation of the transcription factor NRF2 and 
subsequent expression of antioxidant systems (22); therefore, we measured the protein 
expression of NRF2 and its downstream targets NQO1 and GCLM. We observed that the NRF2 
pathway was markedly activated by Sax and Sit treatment in vitro (Fig. 2D) and in vivo (Fig. 2, 
E and F). Similar results were obtained by treating cancer cells with commercial human drugs 
Sax or Sit (fig. S7). Thus, these results suggest that Sax and Sit activate NRF2 to increase 
intracellular antioxidants and neutralize ROS in cancer cells.  
DPP-4i are structurally diverse drugs, so we next investigated if other members of this class 
activate NRF2. Our results showed that Sax, Sit, Vil, alogliptin (Alo), and linagliptin (Lin) 
induced NRF2 and its downstream targets (fig. S8A), as well as antioxidant response element 
(ARE)-driven luciferase reporter gene expression (fig. S8B). Furthermore, we performed a 2D 
similarity search in SYBYL-X 2.0 and found that although the similarity of Sax and Vil is 
72.8%, the other 5 DPP-4i have less than 40% similarity, which means that these DPP-4i do not 
 share a common scaffold (fig. S8C). The fact that structurally diverse DPP-4i inhibited DPP-4 
and induced NRF2 indicates that their ability to activate NRF2 may be a consequence of 
inhibiting DPP-4. 
Next, we further explored the molecular mechanism of DPP-4i-induced NRF2 activation 
focusing on Sax. We measured mRNA and protein expression of NRF2 and its targets in HuH-7 
cells treated with Sax. Both mRNA and protein expression of these targets increased after 
treatment; however, NRF2 transcription did not apparently change, suggesting that Sax 
modulates NRF2 post-transcriptionally (Fig. 2G). Because expression of NRF2 is primarily 
controlled at the protein level by the KELCH-like ECH-associated protein-1 (KEAP1)-
containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex through ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal 
degradation of NRF2 (23), we next assessed the ubiquitination and half-life of NRF2. We 
observed decreased NRF2 ubiquitination and a three-fold half-life increase (from 13.7 to 50.4 
min) after Sax treatment (Fig. 2, H and I). Furthermore, because cysteine151 in KEAP1 is 
specifically required for NRF2 activation by canonical NRF2 inducers sulforaphane (SF) and 
tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) (24), we examined the effect of this cysteine in NRF2 induction 
by Sax. We observed that NRF2 induction by Sax was inhibited in KEAP1-C151S mutant cells 
(Fig. 2J), indicating that Sax activates NRF2 in a KEAP1-C151 dependent manner. 
 
NRF2 inhibition attenuates tumor metastases  
Recent data indicate that persistent activation of NRF2, the “dark side of NRF2”, promotes 
tumorigenesis (22); however, whether persistent NRF2 activation promotes tumor metastasis is 
unclear. Because Sax and Sit promote tumor metastasis and also activate NRF2 signaling, we 
tested whether Sax and Sit promote tumor metastasis via activation of NRF2. We knocked down 
 NRF2 in SW480, HCT116, and Huh-7 cells and observed a marked decrease of Sax and Sit- 
induced metastasis-associated proteins (Fig. 3A). Moreover, NRF2 silencing reduced Sax- and 
Sit-driven cancer cell migration (Fig. 3B) and inhibited persistence and FMI (Fig. 3C), as well as 
intrinsic migratory capacity (Fig. 3D). Similarly, knockdown of NRF2 with lentiviral shRNA 
targeting NRF2 in HuH-7-LUC+ greatly reduced the expression of NRF2 and its downstream 
targets at the protein level in cells (Fig. 3E) and mRNA in metastatic nodules in vivo (Fig. 3F). It 
also decreased intrinsic (Fig. 3G) and Sax- and Sit-induced (Fig. 3H) metastases in mice 
inoculated with these cells. Together, these results suggest that NRF2 inhibition attenuates tumor 
metastases.  
 
Activation of NRF2 promotes tumor metastasis  
To further confirm the role of NRF2 in tumor metastasis, we investigated the effects of NRF2 
activation on migration and metastasis. We noted that the expression of metastasis-associated 
proteins increased upon genetic (by NRF2 overexpression) or pharmacologic [treatment with SF, 
a well-characterized NRF2 activator (25)] NRF2 activation (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, cell 
migration was also enhanced (Fig. 4C). Moreover, time-lapse microscopy confirmed increased 
directed and persistent migration of cells treated with SF (Fig. 4D). In vivo, SF treatment also 
activated the NRF2 pathway (Fig. 4, E and F). We observed that the normally nontoxic low-dose 
SF treatment (25) (10 mg/kg, three times per week) caused animal weight loss (Fig. 4G), which 
might be related to an increased metastatic tumor burden (Fig. 4H), similar to what was observed 
with Sax and Sit treatments. Consistently, an increase in micro-metastasis was confirmed by 
H&E staining and IHC analysis of VIMENTIN in liver and lung tissues (Fig. 4I). These results 
 indicate that NRF2 activation increases the ability of cancer cells to migrate, which results in 
increased metastasis.  
 
Pharmacological activation of NRF2 by ALA promotes tumor metastasis 
Oxidative stress contributes to the onset of diabetes and its associated complications, making the 
prescription of antioxidants a regular clinical practice (26). Some antioxidants used for diabetic 
treatment, such as ALA, are known NRF2 activators (27). Because our results showed that NRF2 
activation accelerates tumor metastasis, we investigated whether ALA also promotes tumor 
metastasis. Indeed, ALA treatment activated the NRF2 pathway, increased metastasis-associated 
protein expression (Fig. 5A), and promoted migration in SW480 and HCT116 cells (Fig. 5B). In 
vivo, low-dose ALA, which also does not affect normal mouse weight (28), increased NRF2 and 
downstream protein expression (Fig. 5, C and D) and caused weight loss in tumor bearing-mice 
(Fig. 5E), similar to what we previously observed for Sax, Sit, and SF treatments. Moreover, 
ALA increased total metastatic tumor burden (Fig. 5F) and increased micro-metastasis to the 
liver and lungs (Fig. 5G). Thus, these results indicate that pharmacological activation of NRF2 
by ALA also promotes cancer cell migration and tumor metastasis.  
 
NRF2 is a potential metastatic marker in human liver cancer  
To further characterize the value of NRF2 expression in cancer metastasis, we analyzed human 
liver cancer tissue microarrays, including 176 primary tumor samples (105 non-metastatic, 69 
lymph node metastases, 2 distant metastases) and 19 metastatic tumors, to correlate the 
expression of NRF2 and its downstream target GCLM with patient clinicopathological features 
(images

and 
http://www.biomax.us/tissue-arrays/Liver/LV1221). 
Overall, 
compared to non-metastatic cancer, metastatic cancer (either primary tumor or metastatic lesion) 
had greater NRF2 and GCLM expression, P < 0.0001 (Fig. 6, A and B). NRF2 and GCLM 
expression were associated with lymph node metastasis and tumor stage (P < 0.0001), but were 
not correlated to sex, age, pathology type, tumor size, or grade (Fig. 6, C and D; table S4 and 
S5). Therefore, our data suggest that NRF2 activation contributes to enhanced metastasis in 
human liver cancer, and as such, may be a promising biomarker as well as a therapeutic target. 
 Discussion  
Recent evidence has shown that diabetes may increase the risk of many cancers, and the 
incidence of diabetic patients with cancer has increased (1). In this subpopulation, long-term 
anti-diabetic therapy may potentially have an impact on existing tumors (1-3). Therefore, there is 
a public health concern to choose anti-diabetic drugs that maximize anti-diabetic benefits but 
have no tumor-promoting effects.  
Here, we determined that the hypoglycemic drugs used in T2DM, DPP-4i Sax and Sit (9) 
and the anti-neuropathic antioxidant ALA (28), increased the risk of metastasis of multiple 
tumors which represent common comorbidities of diabetes. Our meta-analysis of the existing 
clinical evidence showed that DPP-4i used alone or in combination with other drugs, did not 
increase the risk of cancers, indicating that these drugs have no carcinogenic effects. However, 
the results we present here indicate that Sax and Sit enhance cancer cells’ mobility and invasive 
capacity and may promote tumor metastasis. Consistent with our results, a recent case report 
showed that Sax aggravated the condition of a patient with metastatic carcinoid tumor (29). 
However, DPP-4 inhibition was also recently reported to improve anti-tumor immunity by 
regulating 
CXCL10-mediated 
lymphocyte 
trafficking, 
showing 
potential 
for 
tumor 
immunotherapy applications (30). Future studies that fully characterize the effects of DPP-4i on 
tumors will be required for a comprehensive evaluation of the administration of DPP-4i in cancer 
patients. Additionally, we showed that ALA also promoted tumor metastasis, whereas some 
reports showed that ALA can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induce apoptosis (31), 
highlighting the need for a deep and comprehensive understanding of anti-diabetic drugs’ effects 
on cancer biology.  
 Our findings suggest that antioxidants that activate NRF2 may accelerate tumor metastasis. 
By analyzing metabolic factors associated with tumor progression (20-22), we found that Sax 
and Sit did not affect lactate metabolism or ATP generation in cancer cells, but reduced ROS by 
activating the NRF2-mediated antioxidant response. Additionally, Sax- and Sit-promoted 
metastasis was markedly attenuated by NRF2 knockdown, which suggested that Sax and Sit 
promote tumor metastasis mainly through activation of NRF2. Notably, Sax and Sit activated 
NRF2 at lower doses than SF (0.1 and 0.6 μM vs. 5-10 μM, respectively), indicating that these 
are more potent drugs. Sax inhibited NRF2 ubiquitination in a KEAP1-C151 dependent manner, 
but we do not rule out the possibility that it could also act through other KEAP1 cysteine sensors, 
such as C226, C434, or C613, as reported previously (32, 33). In addition, KEAP1-independent 
mechanisms, like glycogen synthase kinse-3 (GSK-3)-dependent Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF)/β-
TrCP-mediated degradation of NRF2, might also contribute to the effect of Sax (34). Therefore, 
further studies are needed to completely elucidate the mechanism of NRF2 induction by DPP-4i. 
Many antioxidants, such as ALA, have been confirmed to activate NRF2 (27). Here we showed 
that activation of NRF2, either by activators (DPP-4i, ALA, and SF) or by overexpression, 
decrease oxidative stress and promote tumor metastasis. Our results support the notion that ROS 
limit distant metastasis and antioxidants accelerate migration and invasion of cancer cells (35, 
36). However, contradicting results have raised the possibility that oxidative stress might 
promote metastasis in some cell lines (37). We believe that specific characteristics of 
antioxidants and cell lines with different gene mutations may contribute to the contradictory 
results regarding the role of ROS and antioxidant supplementation in tumor metastasis. Further 
investigations will be necessary to dissect the role of oxidative stress in cancer metastasis in 
different tumor types and models. 
 Our findings also offer a potential therapeutic target for tumor metastasis. The dark side of 
NRF2 in tumor biology was recently discovered. Many studies, including ours, showed that 
NRF2 expression was increased in various human cancers (38), and this aberrant accumulation 
of NRF2 correlated with oncogene expression, cell proliferation, and cancer chemoresistance 
(22, 39). Here, we identified that persistent NRF2 activation also increased tumor metastasis. 
Consistent with our results, osteopontin induced glioma cell migration and invasion via NRF2 
activation (40). Most importantly, NRF2 knockdown decreased cancer cell migration and tumor 
metastasis, suggesting that NRF2 may serve as a promising therapeutic target for tumor 
metastasis. The detailed mechanism by which NRF2 regulates metastasis-associated proteins is 
currently unclear. Studies have shown that NRF2 knockdown correlates with reduced HIF-1α 
and low VEGF expression; however, NRF2 does not regulate HIF-1α transcriptionally but 
through indirect mechanisms (41, 42). Moreover, a recent study identified ARE and ARE-like 
sequences in the promoter region of COX-2, suggesting that NRF2 may directly control COX-2 
transcription (43). Further investigation of how these metastasis-associated proteins are regulated 
by NRF2 is still needed. 
Our human tissue microarray analysis provides clinicopathological insight into the 
association of NRF2 expression and metastasis. In liver cancer tissue samples, the expression of 
NRF2 and GCLM in metastasis-positive lesions (lymph nodes and distant metastases) was higher 
than in metastasis-negative lesions. The expression of NRF2 and GCLM also correlated with 
tumor stage. These results showed that NRF2 may not only be used to evaluate the sensitivity 
and response to chemo and radiotherapy as previously reported (44), but may also serve as a 
prognostic biomarker for tumor metastasis. 
 One limitation of our study is the weakness of using cell lines to study the metastatic 
process. Cancer cell lines are often derived from the primary site or distant metastases of cancer 
patients. Tumorigenicity of these cells mainly reflects their ability to form tumors at different 
sites if they are injected intravenously. Even if these cells are injected in the paw, they could still 
rapidly enter the circulation by mechanisms that are distinct from those that trigger normal 
metastasis. This is the inherent weakness of using cancer cell lines in xenograft models to study 
the metastasis process. Moreover, the variation among different cancer cell lines with regard to 
their origins and mutations (table S6) might influence the interpretation of the results. Future 
studies of tumor metastasis in diabetic mice will more adequately reflect the current clinical 
application of DPP-4i. 
In summary, our study shows that the anti-diabetic DPP-4i (Sax and Sit) and the anti-
neuropathic ALA promote tumor metastasis via NRF2 activation by inhibition of NRF2 
ubiquitination in a KEAP1-C151-dependent manner, although they do not increase cancer 
incidence. In human cancer tissues, NRF2 expression positively correlated with tumor 
metastasis, suggesting that NRF2 may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. Our 
findings indicate that antioxidants that activate NRF2 signaling should be administered with 
caution in cancer patients. Our study also argues for a need to perform more comprehensive 
preclinical and clinical studies in cancer patients, such as the subpopulation of diabetic patients 
with cancer, to ensure the safety of antioxidants.

Fig. 1. DPP-4i (Sax and Sit) promote tumor metastasis. (A-D) The indicated cancer cell lines 
were treated with 0.1 μM saxagliptin (Sax) or 0.6 μM sitagliptin (Sit) for 24 h. The quantification 
of migration assay (A, left) and matrigel invasion assay (A, right) are shown. n=10 fields, the 
experiments were performed in triplicates. (B) Metastasis-associated protein expression was 
detected by immunoblotting. HuH-7 cell movements were tracked by time-lapse microscopy (C), 
and the persistence and forward migration index (FMI) of cell migration were analyzed using 
cell tracking software (D, n=20). (E-H) Nude mice were foot pad (FP)-inoculated with 1×105 
HCT116-LUC+ cells or tail vein (TV)-injected with HuH-7-LUC+ cells in a spontaneous or 
experimental metastasis model, respectively. One week later, mice (n=9) were treated with Sax
