Abstract
Introduction: Vectorborne diseases are major causes of death and illness worldwide. In the United States, the most 
common vectorborne pathogens are transmitted by ticks or mosquitoes, including those causing Lyme disease; 
Rocky Mountain spotted fever; and West Nile, dengue, and Zika virus diseases. This report examines trends in 
occurrence of nationally reportable vectorborne diseases during 2004–2016.
Methods: Data reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System for 16 notifiable vectorborne diseases 
during 2004–2016 were analyzed; findings were tabulated by disease, vector type, location, and year.
Results: A total 642,602 cases were reported. The number of annual reports of tickborne bacterial and protozoan 
diseases more than doubled during this period, from >22,000 in 2004 to >48,000 in 2016. Lyme disease accounted 
for 82% of all tickborne disease reports during 2004–2016. The occurrence of mosquitoborne diseases was marked 
by virus epidemics. Transmission in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa accounted for most 
reports of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus diseases; West Nile virus was endemic, and periodically epidemic, in 
the continental United States.
Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Vectorborne diseases are a large and growing public 
health problem in the United States, characterized by geographic specificity and frequent pathogen emergence and 
introduction. Differences in distribution and transmission dynamics of tickborne and mosquitoborne diseases are 
often rooted in biologic differences of the vectors. To effectively reduce transmission and respond to outbreaks will 
require major national improvement of surveillance, diagnostics, reporting, and vector control, as well as new tools, 
including vaccines.
Introduction
Vectors are blood-feeding insects and ticks capable of transmit-
ting pathogens between hosts. Wide varieties of pathogens have 
evolved to exploit vector transmission, including some viruses, 
bacteria, rickettsia, protozoa, and helminths. Dengue viruses are 
estimated to infect nearly 400 million persons worldwide each 
year (1), and malaria (2) is a major cause of pediatric mortal-
ity in equatorial Africa. Plague (3) and rickettsioses (4) cause 
deadly epidemics abroad. In the United States, 16 vectorborne 
diseases are reportable to state and territorial health departments, 
which are encouraged to report them to the National Notifiable 
Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS). Among the diseases 
on the list that are caused by indigenous pathogens are Lyme 
disease (Borrelia burgdorferi); West Nile, dengue and Zika virus 
diseases; plague (Yersinia pestis); and spotted fever rickettsioses 
(e.g., Rickettsia rickettsii). Malaria and yellow fever are no longer 
transmitted in the United States but have the potential to be rein-
troduced. As a group, vectorborne diseases in the United States 
are notable for their wide distribution and resistance to control. 
A Food and Drug Administration–approved vaccine is available 
to prevent only one of the notifiable diseases, yellow fever.
Despite the dissimilarities among vectorborne pathogens and 
the many vector species that can transmit them, commonalities 
exist. Vectorborne disease epidemiology is complex because 
of environmental influences on the biology and behavior of 
the vectors. The longevity, distribution, biting habits, and 
propagation of vectors, which ultimately affect the intensity 
of transmission, depend on environmental factors such as 
rainfall, temperature, and shelter. Most vectorborne pathogens 
are zoonoses, often with wild animal reservoirs, such as rodents 
or birds, making them difficult or impossible to eliminate. 
Arthropod vectors can bridge the gap between animals and

humans that would not ordinarily intersect, as happens in 
Lyme disease, plague, and West Nile virus (WNV), facilitating 
the introduction of emerging animal pathogens to humans.
The pace of emergence of new or obscure vectorborne pathogens 
through introduction or belated recognition appears to be increas-
ing. Since 2004, these have included two previously unknown, life-
threatening tickborne RNA viruses, Heartland (5) and Bourbon (6), 
both reported from the U.S. Midwest. A tickborne relapsing fever 
agent, Borrelia miyamotoi, first described in Japan, has been found 
widely distributed in the United States (7) and another bacterial 
spirochete, Borrelia mayonii (8) was discovered in the upper U.S. 
Midwest. T
wo tickborne spotted fever Rickettsiae, R. parkeri (9) and 
Rickettsia species 364D (10), and a tickborne Ehrlichia (E. muris 
eauclairensis) (11) were discovered to be pathogenic to humans. The 
mosquitoborne viruses chikungunya and Zika were introduced to 
Puerto Rico in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Zika virus is emblem-
atic of the dangers of emergence. Zika was one of a number of 
obscure, mosquitoborne viruses known to be pathogenic to humans 
that are rarely encountered or studied (12). In the 60 years follow-
ing its discovery in a monkey in Uganda, it was seldom reported 
as a human pathogen. In 2016, there were >36,000 cases reported 
in Puerto Rico, limited autochthonous, or local, transmission in 
Florida and Texas, and nearly 5,000 cases among travelers to the 
United States (13). The teratogenic consequences of the 2015–2017 
epidemic in the region of the Americas were unexpected.
CDC examined trends of reported vectorborne disease cases 
in the United States during 2004–2016; this report discusses the 
challenges of prevention and control and highlights opportunities 
for vectorborne disease preparedness at the state and local level.
Methods
Vectorborne disease data from NNDSS were retrieved from 
2004, the first year that both neuroinvasive and nonneuroin-
vasive arthropodborne viral (arboviral) diseases were nation-
ally notifiable, through 2016, the most recent year for which 
complete data are available (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/
conditions/notifiable). Data were tabulated by disease, vector 
type (i.e., mosquito, tick, or flea), state or territory of residence, 
and year. State health departments report human disease cases 
using standard surveillance case definitions that include clini-
cal and laboratory criteria. For some diseases, data reported 
according to Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists 
definitions as confirmed or probable have been combined; 
autochthonous and travel-associated cases have been analyzed 
together by state or territory in which they were found.
Chikungunya virus, Zika virus, and Babesia cases became 
notifiable after 2004; only those data in NNDSS are presented. 
Although dengue became nationally notifiable only in 2010, 
earlier national data were available from CDC’s Dengue Branch 
and are included in this analysis.
Results
Nearly 650,000 cases of vectorborne disease were reported 
during 2004–2016 (Table). Tickborne diseases, which 
accounted for >75% of reports, occur throughout the conti-
nental United States, but predominate in the eastern part of 
the country and in areas along the Pacific Coast (Figure 1). 
Reported cases of tickborne disease have doubled in the 13-year 
analysis period, with Lyme disease accounting for 82% of 
cumulative reported tickborne disease. The combined inci-
dence of reported anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis, which are tick-
borne bacterial diseases, rose almost every year, as did spotted 
fever; babesiosis, a tickborne parasitic infection that has been 
notifiable since 2011, also contributed to the rise. Endemic 
plague, a fleaborne disease that is transmitted mostly in the 
rural southwestern United States, did not exceed 17 cases in a 
year. Tularemia and ehrlichiosis are geographically widespread 
but more prevalent in the central United States.
By contrast, the occurrence of mosquitoborne viruses was dis-
persed (Figure 2) and punctuated by epidemics (Table) (Figure 3). 
WNV was the most commonly transmitted mosquitoborne disease 
in the continental United States. Its most notable epidemic dur-
ing 2004–2016 occurred in 2012, especially in Texas. Epidemics 
of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses were mostly confined 
to the U.S. territories. All four dengue viruses were endemic in 
Puerto Rico, which was subject to cyclical epidemics, notably in 
2010 and during 2012–2013. Puerto Rico’s first chikungunya virus 
epidemic peaked in 2014, followed by Zika virus in 2016. T
ravelers 
infected in the territories and Latin America accounted for >90% 
of the dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus disease cases identi-
fied in the states and District of Columbia; limited autochthonous 
transmission of dengue occurred in Florida, Hawaii, and T
exas, and 
of chikungunya and Zika viruses in Texas and Florida. Malaria is 
diagnosed in approximately 1,500 travelers yearly but no autoch-
thonous transmission was documented during 2004–2016.
Conclusions and Comments
These data indicate persistent, locality-specific risks and a 
rising threat from emerging vectorborne diseases, which have 
increasingly encumbered local and state health departments 
tasked with preventing, detecting, reporting, and controlling 
them. The overall case number masks two distinct trends. 
Epidemics characterize the mosquitoborne viruses. WNV trans-
mission is effectively limited to the continental United States, 
whereas most dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus transmission 
occurred in the territories. By contrast, the increasing reports 
of tickborne disease, which occurs almost exclusively in the 
continental United States, has been gradual. The area at risk for 
Lyme disease has been expanding (14). Although Lyme disease 
accounts for 82% of all reported tickborne diseases, spotted 
fevers, babesiosis, and anaplasmosis/ehrlichiosis have become

increasingly prevalent. Diseases caused by pathogens that were 
relatively uncommon during the 13-year analysis period remain 
important because of their historical potential to cause epidemics 
(e.g., St. Louis encephalitis virus), their high case fatality rates 
(e.g., eastern equine encephalitis virus), or their potential as 
bioterror agents (e.g., plague and tularemia).
The reported data substantially underestimate disease occur-
rence. NNDSS relies on a person seeking care, a clinician 
requesting appropriate tests, and providers or laboratories 
reporting to public health authorities. Recent data from clini-
cal and laboratory diagnoses estimate that Lyme disease infects 
approximately 300,000 Americans yearly, eight- to tenfold 
more than the number reported (15,16). Many arbovirus 
infections result in minimal symptoms. It has been estimated 
that 30–70 nonneuroinvasive arboviral disease cases occur for 
every WNV neuroinvasive disease case reported (17). Based on 
the number of neuroinvasive disease cases reported in 2016, 
between 39,300 and 91,700 nonneuroinvasive disease cases 
of WNV would have been expected to occur, but only 840 
(1%–2%) were reported (17).
The dynamics of vectorborne pathogen transmission are sig-
nificantly influenced by the characteristics of vector, reservoir, 
and host. Tickborne pathogens rarely cause sudden epidemics 
because humans are typically incidental hosts who do not trans-
mit further, and tick mobility is mostly limited to that of its ani-
mal hosts. For ticks, the prolonged life cycle and widely separated 
blood feeds limit opportunities for pathogen transmission. Ixodes 
scapularis, for example, an important vector of B. burgdorferi, 
might feed on blood once in a year, but this is compensated for 
by their broad host preferences and the ability of single ticks 
to transmit multiple pathogen species. In contrast, the more 
mobile female mosquitoes feed on blood every 48–72 hours.

Dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses are typically transmitted 
directly between humans by the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, after 
about a week’s extrinsic incubation period, resulting in explosive 
epidemics. WNV is one of the few purely zoonotic vectorborne 
pathogens with epidemic potential; humans are only at risk 
from mosquitoes that have fed on viremic birds. There must 
be a coincidence of flocks with a high prevalence of infection 
near humans when vector mosquito species are abundant. Bird 
movement was responsible for WNV’s rapid spread across the 
United States after its introduction to New York City in 1999.
The presence of competent vector species does not alone assure 
transmission. Ae. aegypti, whose range has been expanding,

might now be present in up to 38 states (18), but despite the 
frequent arrival of travelers infected with dengue, chikungunya, 
or Zika viruses, autochthonous transmission has been rare. No 
local transmission of malaria resulted from the importation of 
about 1,500 cases annually, even though Anopheles mosquitoes 
are present in much of the United States. Although the range of 
Ixodes scapularis extends over much of the eastern United States, 
transmission of Lyme disease, B. microti babesiosis, and Powassan 
virus are rare outside of the Northeast and upper Midwest 
regions. Whatever the biologic, economic, behavioral, or land use 
reasons for these differences, the presence of vectors with proven 
or possible capacity to transmit a wide range of pathogens leaves 
the United States susceptible to outbreaks of exotic vectorborne 
diseases, as demonstrated by the limited local transmission of 
dengue and Zika viruses in Florida and Texas.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three limita-
tions. First, underreporting might have substantially limited the 
number of cases analyzed. As noted, the number of Lyme disease 
cases reported to NNDSS is estimated to represent a fraction of 
incident cases. In addition, because many patients with dengue, 
nonneuroinvasive West Nile, and Zika virus infections experience 
mild symptoms, they might not seek medical attention. Second, 
not all the diseases described in this report were reportable for the 
full 13-year analysis period or from all states and territories; babe-
siosis data are only available from 2011 from some states. Finally, 
although CDC collected national dengue data before 2011, the 
first year it was officially designated as notifiable, it is possible a 
higher proportion of cases were reported after reporting became 
mandatory. Overall, it is likely the actual number of vectorborne 
disease cases substantially exceeds those described in this report.
In the face of increasing incidence and threat from novel patho-
gens, the burden on local and state public health departments has 
increased. Critical to effectively preventing or responding to disease 
outbreaks is sensitive disease and vector surveillance, backed by 
well-organized, well-prepared, and sustained vector control opera-
tions. Good surveillance and reporting depend on rapid, accurate 
diagnostic confirmation; more sensitive and specific tests that can 
be used locally are needed. Vaccines against Lyme disease, dengue, 
chikungunya, and Zika, goals of intense research and development, 
could reduce risk from those major threats. The tools for vector 
control are limited but can be effective when implemented rapidly. 
Ticks have been especially difficult to control (19), increasing the 
responsibility for personal protective measures. Nearly all public 
vector control operations in the United States are locally funded and 
operated. Networks of vector control operatives are essential to sup-
port threat reduction and counter outbreaks, yet in a recent national 
survey 84% of 1,083 local mosquito control organizations reported 
lacking one or more of five core vector control competencies (20). 
Resources available to assist state and local health departments could 
be used to develop vector control program competencies.
Reducing vectorborne disease incidence and responding to 
outbreaks is a large and complex challenge. CDC is using two 
strategies to mitigate vectorborne threats: advancing innovation 
and discovery and rebuilding comprehensive vector control 
programs that have eroded over time (20). CDC works with 
states, territories, and tribal councils to compile surveillance 
data, develop strategies and guidance, and educate the public 
about specific threats and prevention measures for populations 
at risk. Expanding sustainable vectorborne disease prevention 
Key Points
• A total of 642,602 cases of 16 diseases caused by 
bacteria, viruses, or parasites transmitted through the 
bites of mosquitoes, ticks, or fleas were reported to 
CDC during 2004–2016. Indications are that cases 
were substantially underreported.
• Tickborne disease cases more than doubled in 13 years 
and were 77% of all vectorborne disease reports. Lyme 
disease accounted for 82% of all tickborne cases, but 
spotted fever rickettsioses, babesiosis, and anaplasmosis/
ehrlichiosis cases also increased. 
• Tickborne diseases predominated in the eastern 
continental United States and areas along the Pacific 
coast. Mosquitoborne dengue, chikungunya, and 
Zika viruses were almost exclusively transmitted in 
Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, where they were periodically epidemic. West 
Nile virus, also occasionally epidemic, was widely 
distributed in the continental United States, where it 
is the major mosquitoborne disease.
• During 2004–2016, nine vectorborne human diseases 
were reported for the first time from the United States 
and U.S. territories. The discovery or introduction of 
novel vectorborne agents will be a continuing threat.  
• Vectorborne diseases have been difficult to prevent and 
control. A Food and Drug Administration–approved 
vaccine is available only for yellow fever virus. Many 
of the vectorborne diseases, including Lyme disease 
and West Nile virus, have animal reservoirs. Insecticide 
resistance is widespread and increasing. 
• Preventing and responding to vectorborne disease 
outbreaks are high priorities for CDC and will require 
additional capacity at state and local levels for tracking, 
diagnosing, and reporting cases; controlling vectors; 
and preventing transmission.
