INTRODUCTION: Malaria remains a devasta-
ting global parasitic disease, with the majority
of malaria deaths caused by the highly virulent
Plasmodium falciparum. The extreme AT-bias
of the P. falciparum genome has hampered
genetic studies through targeted approaches
such as homologous recombination or CRISPR-
Cas9, and only a few hundred P. falciparum
mutants have been experimentally generated
in the past decades. In this study, we have used
high-throughputpiggyBac transposoninsertion-
al mutagenesis and quantitative insertion site
sequencing (QIseq) to reach saturation-level
mutagenesis of this parasite.
RATIONALE:Our study exploits the AT-richness
of the P. falciparum genome, which provides
numerous piggyBac transposon insertion
targets within both gene coding and non-
coding flanking sequences, to generate more
than 38,000 P. falciparum mutants. At this
level of mutagenesis, we could distinguish es-
sential genes as nonmutable and dispensable
genes as mutable. Subsequently, we identified
2680 genes essential for in vitro asexual blood-
stage growth.
RESULTS: We calculated mutagenesis index
scores (MISs) and mutagenesis fitness scores
(MFSs) in order to functionally define the rel-
ative fitness cost of disruption for 5399 genes.
A competitive growth phenotype screen con-
firmed that MIS and MFS were predictive of
the fitness cost for in vitro asexual growth.
Genes predicted to be essential included genes
implicated in drug resistance—such as the “K13”
Kelch propeller, mdr, and dhfr-ts—as well as
targets considered to be high value for drugs
development, such as pkg and cdpk5. The screen
revealed essential genes that are specific to
human Plasmodium parasites but absent from
rodent-infective species, such as lipid meta-
bolic genes that may be crucial to transmission
commitment in human infections. MIS and MFS
profiling provides a clear ranking of the relative
essentiality of gene ontology (GO) functions in
P. falciparum. GO path-
ways associated with trans-
lation, RNA metabolism,
and cell cycle control are
more essential, whereas
genes associated with pro-
tein phosphorylation, vir-
ulence factors, and transcription are more
likely to be dispensable. Last, we confirm that
the proteasome-degradation pathway is a high-
value druggable target on the basis of its high
ratio of essential to dispensable genes, and by
functionally confirming its link to the mode
of action of artemisinin, the current front-line
antimalarial.
CONCLUSION: Saturation-scale mutagenesis
allows prioritization of intervention targets in
the genome of the most important cause of
malaria. The identification of more than 2680
essential genes, including ~1000 Plasmodium-
conserved essential genes, will be valuable for
antimalarial therapeutic research.▪

Severe malaria is caused by the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Despite
decades of research, the distinct biology of these parasites has made it challenging to
establish high-throughput genetic approaches to identify and prioritize therapeutic targets.
Using transposon mutagenesis of P. falciparum in an approach that exploited its AT-rich
genome, we generated more than 38,000 mutants, saturating the genome and defining
mutability and fitness costs for over 87% of genes. Of 5399 genes, our study defined
2680 genes as essential for optimal growth of asexual blood stages in vitro.These essential
genes are associated with drug resistance, represent leading vaccine candidates, and
include approximately 1000 Plasmodium-conserved genes of unknown function. We
validated this approach by testing proteasome pathways for individual mutants associated
with artemisinin sensitivity.
M
alaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum
remains an insidious global health prob-
lem, with hundreds of thousands of
deaths each year. Recently, there have
been substantial reductions in disease
intensity, in part through concerted recent use of
artemisinin-combination therapies, butthese gains
are now threatened by emerging artemisinin-
based combination therapy (ACT) treatment
failures spreading across South East Asia (1, 2).
If ACT resistance reaches Africa, a devastating
rebound of disease is expected, as occurred with
chloroquine resistance in the 1970s. The devel-
opment of new antimalarial therapies, and iden-
tification and prioritization of new targets, is a
priority. More than a decade after the comple-
tion of the P. falciparum genome, a substantial
fraction of its genome still lacks functional an-
notation (3). Although CRISPR-Cas9 and other
targeted endonucleases will accelerate func-
tional genomics studies (4–6), their usefulness
for genome-scale applications is restricted by
the absence of nonhomologous end joining in
Plasmodium parasites and by the extreme AT-
richness of the P. falciparum genome, which
reduces guide RNA target site abundance. There-
fore, a critical need remains for large-scale genetic
analysis to systematically identify essential genes
and prioritize parasite metabolic pathways for
drug discovery (7).
Large-scale genetic screening methods inmodel
organisms rely on efficient scalable methods for
genome engineering. Transposon mutagenesis
using the piggyBac transposon, which prefer-
entially inserts at the tetranucleotide target
sequence TTAA, has been used to carry out whole-
genome loss-of-function screens in many orga-
nisms (8–11). The highly skewed nucleotide
composition of the P. falciparum genome, with
>81% AT content, is an advantage for the ap-
plication of piggyBac mutagenesis. The skewed
composition results in a high density of TTAA
sites, averaging one site per 70 base pairs (bp)
over both coding and noncoding regions, in the-
ory allowing systematic and saturation-level
mutagenesis of the whole genome. Although
piggyBac mutagenesis has been developed and
optimized for P. falciparum, and previously used
for small-scale phenotypic screens and functional
characterization of loss-of-function mutants, it
has not been used for large-scale screening
(12–16). To scale up piggyBac mutagenesis in
P. falciparum, we developed high-throughput
transfection mutagenesis methods that mostly
create a single insertion per genome and com-
bined them with an Illumina-based sequencing
method for identifying transposon insertion sites
(17, 18). This approach, known as quantitative
insertion-site sequencing (QIseq), thus allowed
whole-genome experimental mutagenesis analy-
sis of P. falciparum (fig. S1, A and B).
Achieving saturation-level mutagenesis
In a preliminary study, we carried out large-scale
transfectionsfollowedbyshort-terminvitrogrowth
of mixed pools of drug-selected P. falciparum
parasites and identified insertion sites with QIseq.
This pilot identified a total of 3651 insertions
across the P. falciparum genome (table S1) (17, 19).
On the basis of the density and distribution of
those insertions modeled by a negative bino-
mial distribution, we predicted that recovery of
≥33,000 insertions would be sufficient to achieve
saturation-level mutagenesis in the compact ge-
nome of the malaria parasite (fig. S1, C to F); this
number is sufficient for there to be a high prob-
ability that multiple transposon insertions would
occur within the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of
every protein-coding gene larger than 500 bp.
We therefore scaled our transfection methods
to achieve this number of insertions. Transfected
parasite populations were drug-selected brief-
ly so as to isolate only mutant parasites with
integrated piggyBac elements carrying the drug-
resistance gene hdhfr, before insertion-site loca-
tions were identified with QIseq. Computational
analyses were used to verify the sequence reads
of the QIseq libraries and the consistency of the
raw data (fig. S2, A to F); nearly all QIseq-defined
insertions occurred at the characteristic TTAA
target sequence. All insertion sites that were
not flanked by the consensus TTAA (2.49%) in-
sertion sites were removed from subsequent
analysis (fig. S2A). Previously validated individ-
ual piggyBac mutant clones were included in
each QIseq run in order to act as a control for the
accuracy and sensitivity of each insertion-site
identification run (fig. S3, A to C, and table S2).
The saturation mutagenesis approach identi-
fied ~38,000 independent piggyBac insertions
at distinct TTAA target sites, covering 5399 nu-
clear protein-coding genes across all 14 chromo-
somes of the P. falciparum genome (Fig. 1A and
table S3). These randomly distributed inser-
tions exceeded those predicted to be required to
achieve saturation-level mutagenesis (Fig. 1A),
but there were numerous genes and regions en-
compassing several genes that had significantly
fewer insertions than would be expected purely
on the basis of the distribution of TTAA sites
across the genome (Fig. 1, B, C, and D). As well
as discrepancies in nonrandom spatial distri-
bution, coding regions overall lacked insertions
compared with intergenic regions (P < 2.2× 10–16,
Fisher test) (Fig. 1D). A more detailed analysis
of piggyBac insertion density within transcrip-
tional units revealed that insertions in CDS were
75% less common than in flanking intergenic
regions, and even within intergenic regions,
insertion-site density decreased with proximity
to CDS (Fig. 1E). This significant bias toward
recovering intergenic insertions in surviving
blood-stage parasites, with many CDS having
no insertions, are indications that genes lacking
insertions are lethal when disrupted by piggyBac
insertion.

 Defining gene dispensability by using
mutagenesis index scores
Although there was a bias against insertions
in CDSs, 2042 genes were disrupted by at least
one piggyBac insertion (~38% of genes in the
P. falciparum genome) (Fig. 1F). The remainder,
3357 genes (~62% of the genome) had no inser-
tions in their CDSs, and some of these were also
completely devoid of insertions in the surround-
ing intergenic regions (2.9% of genes) (Fig. 1C,
fig. S4A, and table S4). In the 2042 mutable genes,
insertion sites were distributed uniformly along
the gene body CDSs, indicating that all disrup-
tions have equivalent consequences for the dis-
rupted gene (Fig. 1E). The uniform distribution

that under ideal culture conditions for asexual blood-stage growth,

 of transposon insertions throughout the genome
is independent from chromatin structure and
gene locations (fig. S4B). We therefore reasoned
that the recovery of one or more insertions with-
in the CDS of disrupted genes was an indicator
of gene dispensability for in vitro asexual blood-
stage growth. Therefore, mutable genes are sub-
sequently referred to as dispensable, whereas the
absence of any insertions in the CDS could be
considered an indicator that disruptions are le-
thal, and subsequently, these genes are referred
to as essential. However, the essential classifi-
cation of 677 genes without insertions, which are
small or with lower TTAA, is tentative because
they are below the average distance between
recovered insertions [<613 nucelotides (nt)]
(table S5). To quantify the evidence for dispens-
ability or essentiality of each gene, we developed
a mutagenesis index score (MIS) based on the
number of identified piggyBac insertions rela-
tive to the number of available TTAA target sites
within that gene (Fig. 2A and table S5). Genes
with a higher MIS (on a scale of 0 to 1) were con-
sidered to have a higher possibility of dispens-
ability, whereas those with a lower MIS were
considered to have a higher possibility of essen-
tiality. The 2000 genes with highest and lowest
MISs represent mutability characterization with
the strongest confidence.
Biological processes identified
as dispensable and essential
Mutants in the lowest MIS quartile were en-
riched in core metabolic processes shared across
eukaryotes, which would be predicted to be es-
sential. Mutants in the highest MIS quartile were
enriched in parasite-specific multigene families
that interact directly with the host and that are
known to be partially functionally overlapping
and contain many redundant genes (Fig. 2B).
This screen was carried out by using in vitro
cultured parasites, and many of these in vitro
dispensable genes, such as those for antigenic
variation and cytoadherence, have greater im-
portance in vivo in human infections. The
dispensability of parasite processes involved in
host-parasite interactions contrasted with the
essentiality of internal parasite processes, such
as those associated with RNA metabolism (Fig. 2,
C and D; fig. S6; and table S6). RNase II, a gene
implicated in a posttranscriptional regulatory
mechanism relevant to severe malaria, is an ex-
ample with a low MIS, which is consistent with
previous reports of the locus being refractory to
disruption (20). Other genes involved in general
RNA metabolism that have low MISs include
both widely conserved RNA-binding proteins
(such as PABP) and apicomplexan-specific RNA-
binding proteins likely to have more specific,
mostly unidentified, regulatory targets. The
P. falciparum genome has an abundance of
RNA-binding proteins that are largely func-
tionally uncharacterized, and our analysis sug-
gests that many of these genes are likely to be
essential.
MIS therefore correlates with what is known
broadly about the importance or redundancy of
metabolic pathways. To further validate that MIS
is a good predictor of essentiality, we analyzed
genes that have been the focus of drug or vaccine
development. Genes strongly predicted to be es-
sential based on MIS included the “K13” Kelch
propeller implicated in artemisinin resistance,
as well as other genes implicated in drug resist-
ance, such as DHFR-TS, MDR, and AAC2, which
are involved in pyrimethamine, mefloquine and
atovaquone reistance, respectively. Other genes
classified as essential based on MIS included
ones considered high-priority blood-stage drug
targets such as PKG and CDPK5 (fig. S5). By con-
trast, most blood-stage vaccine candidates were
dispensable, with the notable exception of RH5.
Not unexpectedly, sporozoite vaccine candidates
CSP and TRAP, which are essential for sporozo-
ite development in mosquitoes but are not re-
quired in blood-stage development (21), had
high MIS. By contrast, the gene for pore-forming
protein cell traversal of ookinetes and sporo-
zoites (CelTOS) had a low MIS. CelTOS is im-
portant for these parasite migratory phases and
is emerging as a pre-erythrocytic-transmission–
blocking vaccine candidate; its low MIS indicates
it may also have an essential function in blood-
stage infections, making it a potential multi-
stage vaccine target. MIS analysis also revealed
likely essential genes that are specific to human
Plasmodium parasites but absent from rodent-
infective species, such as the lipid metabolic
genes (PCD and PMT) that are crucial in the de-
velopmentof mosquito-transmissible sexual stages
in P. falciparum (22, 23).
Mutant growth fitness as a measure
of gene dispensability
We previously developed a phenotyping method
in which a pool of piggyBac mutants were grown
as mixed-mutant pools over multiple genera-
tions, and the number of reads for each piggyBac
insertion site was quantified by using next-gen
sequencing in order to measure parasite growth
rates (17). We adapted this method to generate a
second quantitative measure of gene dispensabil-
ity independent from MIS, by comparing the nor-
malized number of reads from each insertion site
to the total pool of reads across all P. falciparum
mutants in the saturation mutagenesis screen
(Fig. 2E and table S5). This mutagenesis fitness
score (MFS) serves as a proxy for mutant growth
fitness. MFSs strongly correlated with MISs, de-
spite the fact that they are independent of each
other (Fig. 2F). The MFS of mutable genes was
high, in keeping with the MIS prediction of
dispensability, whereas predicted essential non-
mutable genes had a low MFS (Fig. 2G). Inter-
mediate MISs and MFSs were weakly correlated,
in keeping with the lower confidence that we
can place on the essentiality or dispensability of
genes with these intermediate scores.
We used a competitive in vitro growth screen
(17) to phenotype four separate pools of mixed-
mutant populations so as to provide additional
validation of the correlation between MIS and
a gene’s importance for growth fitness. Mutable
genes with high MISs and low or minimal fitness
cost were competitive growth “winners,” whereas
growth fitness “losers” had relatively low MISs
(Fig. 3A and table S7). Relatively few mutations
had little or no fitness cost, as measured with
MFS, resulting in a disproportionate number of
mutant losers (Fig. 3B). Overall, both the MIS
and MFS were predictive of the fitness cost for
in vitro asexual growth (Fig. 3C), and between
these metrics, we were able to predict separate
5399 genes in the P. falciparum genome into
nonmutable and mutable categories (Fig. 3, D
and E).
Association of essentiality with genome
structure and transcription patterns
Dispensable and essential genes rarely occurred
as single isolated genes but rather occurred
as multigene clusters reminiscent of conserved
syntenic blocks (Fig. 1, A and C, and fig. S4A)
(24). We therefore assessed the relationship
between evolutionary conservation of genome
structure and essentiality or dispensability by
using previously defined syntenic relationships
between Plasmodium spp. (25). Syntenic genes
indeed had lower MISs, suggesting conserved
essential functions across Plasmodium spp.; con-
versely, nonsyntenic genes were more likely to be
dispensable (Fig. 4A). Mapping chromosomal
regions with synteny breaks, which typically har-
bor gene duplications and paralogs, showed pat-
terns of clustering of essential and dispensable
genes in syntenic and nonsyntenic chromosomal
regions, as seen in examples for chromosomes 13
and 10 (Fig. 4, B to E).
Transcription metrics for each gene based on
maximum FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon
per million fragments mapped) values (26) were
examined for correlations with essentiality and
dispensability (Fig. 5A). This analysis showed
that essential genes are expressed at significantly
(P = 2.2 × 10−16) higher levels throughout both
the asexual and sexual life cycle phases, indicat-
ing that they may have critical functional roles
throughout both the mosquito and human stages
and therefore represent potential multistage drug
targets (Figs. 5, B and C). Within the intraerythro-
cytic cycle, genes with peak expression during the
trophozoite stage were more likely to be essential
than those expressed during other stages (Fig. 5C).
During the trophozoite stage, P. falciparum must
acquire nutrients from the host and remodel the
infected erythrocyte to avoid host defenses, such
as clearance by the spleen. By contrast, dispens-
able processes were enriched at either end of
intraerythrocytic development, reflecting parasite
stages with a greater need for functional redun-
dancy, such as those involved in host interaction
(such as erythrocyte invasion and antigenic var-
iation), and are hence more likely to undergo
duplication or paralog evolution. Not unexpect-
edly, ~41% of the dispensable genes are pre-
dominantly expressed in sexual stages (Fig. 5C).
These genes may be essential for transmission to
or from the mosquito but do not appear to have
an essential function for asexual blood-stage
development. The high coverage of sexual-stage
genes in this screen emphasizes the potential for

Evolutionary conservation of
apicomplexan gene essentiality
We compared the data from our genome-wide
saturation screen with data from large-scale
genome-sequencing studies of P. falciparum,
as well as data from recent large-scale mutagenesis
studies of apicomplexan genomes (6, 18, 27–29),
to evaluate the conservation of gene essenti-
ality across the organisms’ lineages. Essential
P. falciparum genes were more highly conserved
across Plasmodium spp. (Fig. 5D and fig. S8A),
are less likely to have a paralog (Fig. 5E and fig.
S8B), and encode genes with less genetic varia-
tion among P. falciparum clinical isolates (Fig. 5F
and fig. S8C). Of the P. falciparum genes studied
here, 2083 and 1998 have orthologs in the more
distantly related parasites Toxoplasma gondii (6)
and P. berghei (29), respectively. Overall, there
was a strong correlation in gene function be-
tween species, particularly with genes predicted
as essential (Fig. 5, G and H, and fig. S8, D and E).
Genes that are dispensable in P. falciparum were
also more likely to be dispensable in P. berghei. By
contrast, the correlation between the dispensable

 genes of P. falciparum and T. gondii was weaker,
indicating that genus-specific gene functions are
enriched for dispensability. Overall, these com-
parisons show that although phenotype classi-
fications from the large-scale mutagenesis screens
in apicomplexan species are also broadly predic-
tive of the P. falciparum phenotype classifica-
tions, the closer evolutionary relationship of
P. berghei provides a higher level of sensitivity
and specificity for the orthologs that could be
disrupted (Fig. 5I and fig. S8F).
Consistent with this assessment that nonmu-
table genes represented core essential functions
in P. falciparum, Gene Ontology (GO) enrich-
ment analysis indicated that genes with functions
associated with translation, RNA metabolism,
and cell cycle control were more likely to be es-
sential, whereas genes associated with protein
phosphorylation, virulence factors, and transcrip-
tion were more likely to be dispensable (Fig. 6A).
Comparing the relative number of essential,
versus dispensable, genes within specific GO
biological processes, molecular functions, and
cellular components provided a ranking of the
essentiality of potential druggable targets and
pathways (Fig. 6, A to C; fig. S9, A to C; and table
S8). For example, nearly all genes annotated
as being involved in ubiquitin-dependent deg-
radation processes were experimentally defined
as essential, whereas individual genes linked
to microtubule motility and antigenic varia-
tion are experimentally defined as dispensable
based on MIS. RNA metabolism and translation-
related processes are also highly essential, sup-
porting emerging evidence for the importance
of posttranscriptional and -translational con-
trol (30).
Essentiality of the
proteasome-degradation pathway
Recentgeneticanalysisofartemisinin-combination
therapy resistance has linked drug resistance to
cellular stress-response mechanisms involving
the P. falciparum ubiquitin/proteasome system
(31, 32). Genes of the proteasome-degradation
pathway were well represented in the piggyBac
mutagenesis screen, and 54 of the 72 genes
could be classified as essential genes according to
our data (fig. S10A), further strengthening the
priority of the proteasome degradation pathway
as a high-value druggable target (33). We val-
idated this link between artemisinin sensitivity
and proteasome inhibition sensitivity using a set
of single-insertion piggyBac mutants previously
defined with chemogenomic profiling to be part
of an artemisinin-sensitivity cluster, including a
mutant of the K13 Kelch propeller gene (16, 34).
We found 10-fold increased sensitivity to the
proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib in mutants of
the artemisinin-sensitivity cluster, which is sig-
nificantly different relative to wild-type NF54 or
mutants with distinct chemogenomic profiles
(fig. S10, B to E), providing additional support for
the association between the ART (Artimisinin)
mechanism of action and proteasome function.
Summary
Our genome-wide saturation mutagenesis screen
in the major human pathogen P. falciparum has
defined genes essential for parasite survival
during the blood stage and provided critical
functional data for prioritizing high-value drug
targets and pathways. The complete charac-
terization of the essential genome with high-
throughput saturation mutagenesis will help
open new frontiers for antimalarial therapeu-
tic research. The methodology also opens the
way for new systematic functional screens for
other phenotypes, such as transmission and
cytoadherence.
Materials and Methods
Parasite culture
All P. falciparum parasite NF54 and piggyBac
mutants were cultured in complete RPMI 1640
with 5% hematocrit (medium containing 0.5%
Albumax II, 0.25% sodium bicarbonate and
0.01 mg/ml gentamicin). All parasite cultures
were maintained by standard methods (35).
piggyBac Transfection
High-efficiency transfection(96-wellplate method)
was carried out on NF54 schizonts purified by
magnetic column (MiltyenyiBiotec, CS column)
using a transposon plasmid (pLBacII-HDH, con-
taining selection marker human dhfr) and a
transposase-expressing helper plasmid (pDCTH)
(19, 35). RBCs were first loaded with plasmid DNA
by electroporation using Gene PulserXCell+CE
Module (BioRad). A total of 10 million schizonts,
1200 mg plasmid DNA and 600 mg helper plasmid
DNA were used per 96-well plate to achieve max-
imal transfection efficiency. The drug WR99210
(final concentration 2.5 nM) was added to each
plate for selecting transfected parasites, using a
robot (Integra VIAFLO 96) to change media with
drug every day for 5 days. Transfections were per-
formed in batches over the course of 4 to 6 weeks.
Each 96-well plate was cultured in triplicate and
cryopreserved in duplicate. One hundred 96-well
plates were used to generate the large pools for
sequencing (fig. S1A).

 For maximum recovery of unique mutants,
the transfected culture was distributed into
96-well plates by robot (200 ml each well) and
grown under two rounds of drug selection. Wells
were screened for parasites by PCR and Giemsa-
stained thin blood films. >50% of wells became
parasite-positive within three weeks. Each po-
sitive well with ≥9 unique mutants (one well =
one “Mixed Population”, or MP) was cryopre-
served in duplicate (two 96 well plates). Addi-
tional 96-well plates were used to generate the
pools that were then cultured in a T75 flask and
harvested after two cycles growth by standard
methods for genomic DNA isolation for QIseq
(17). Although mutants grow at different rates,
the pools can be expanded for at least 12 asexual
life cycle generations (“cycles”) without signifi-
cant loss in detectable diversity. Importantly,
each mutant pool can be regenerated and cloned
from their original MPs.
Datasets of reference genomes,
transcriptome data and epigenetics data
The NF54 reference genome can be down-
loaded from (ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/project/
pathogens/Plasmodium/falciparum/NF54/
Assembly/V1_morphed). The QIseq sequenc-
ing mapping followed previously published
methods (17). Ortholog counts, paralog counts,
and non-synonymous/synonymous (NonSyn/
Syn) ratios can be downloaded from PlasmoDB
(http://plasmodb.org/plasmo) (36). Previously
published RNA-seq expression data (26, 37)
are used in computational analysis. Formaldehyde-
Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements
(FAIRE-seq) data of seven time points (0, 6,
12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 hour) were used to measure
chromatin accessibility (38). The motif infor-
mation of transcription factor ApiAP2 bind-
ing sites is available in previously published
work (39). The genome synteny across five
Plasmodium species is available in published
work (25).
Identification of >38,000 mutants
carrying piggyBac insertion
The QIseq sequencing generated a total of
3,301,112 raw reads. First, all the raw reads were
filtered by the criteria of matching expected
transposon target site “ TTAA.” This filtering
step yielded 2,042,147 reads, which is >sixfold
genome coverage. The insertion site QIseq signal
was calculated as the reads count of the filtered
QIseq reads. To compare the insertion signals

 We computed the number of gene CDSs targeted
by the insertions upper cutoff (i.e., more accu-
rate). We noticed that there was a single large
and sharp increase in the number of CDSs tar-
geted by the insertions with reads number in-
creasing from cutoff 2.0 to cutoff 2.3 (P < 0.05
compared with changing another cutoff) (fig.
S2E). The result indicated a large amount of false
positive may be included when setting cutoff ≥
2.3. Therefore, the normalized reads count = 2.3
was set as the lower bound for identifying true
insertions.
Mutagenesis saturation
computational validation
To evaluate the levels of whole-genome muta-
genesis and eventual saturation, we used a com-
putational method based on sampling. First, a
specific number of insertions were randomly
extracted and the fraction of genome elements
targeted were counted. This procedure was re-
peated 1000 times for each query insertion num-
ber in fig. S1C. A log-based curve was observed by
plotting the mutational events and the median
number of genome elements targeted by in-
sertions. The plateauing of the curve at about
20,000 mutational events indicated that a very
small number of new genome elements could be
targeted even with very large amount of inser-
tions. Importantly, the real data-based sampl-
ing curve was very similar to our independent
mathematical predictions of Negative Binomial
distributions prior to the start of the saturation
mutagenesis experiments (fig. S1D). Together,
both our mathematical model and real-data com-
putational sampling show that >33,000 mutants
representsaturation-levelmutagenesisoftheentire
set of protein-encoding genes in the P. falciparum
genome.
Sampling methods for accounting for
fragment length differences and
nucleoside composition bias
For genes in the P. falciparum genome, 5′ up-
stream and 3′ downstream intergenic regions
displayed similar TTAA densities (median num-
ber of TTAA sites per 100 bp were 1.82 and 1.89,
respectively). However, they have significantly
different region length distributions (median
values are 1681 bp and 926 bp in 5′ and 3′ direc-
tion, respectively; P < 0.001 Wilcoxon test). There-
fore, there are different numbers of genomic
TTAA sites in 5′ and 3′ intergenic regions, as
an intrinsic feature of the P. falciparum genome.
To account for this region-length and total-
TTAA bias in our QIseq calculations, the TTAA
sites in 3′ intergenic regions were sampled
based on the TTAA number in 5′ intergenic
regions, so that our comparison was based on
two identical background target-site distri-
butions. Distribution of insertions and TTAA
sites (Fig. 1E) were plotted based on these sampl-
ing data.
MIS calculation
To quantify the mutability of every protein-
coding gene in the P. falciparum genome, we
first checked the number of piggyBac insertions
located inside the gene CDS regions. To keep the
criteria stringent, the insertions located on the
very end (distance from insertion to TSS > 99%
of the CDS length) of the CDS were not con-
sidered, due to a significantly higher number of
insertions at the last 1% of the CDS compared
with other regions of the CDS (fig. S2F). We cal-
culated the initial score MIS of gene MSg based
on the equation
MSg ¼ log Ng þ 1
Dg
�
�
ð2Þ
where Ng represents the number of insertions on
gene g. Dg is the TTAA density of the gene g,
which could be represented as the number of
TTAA per kb of the CDS. We found that the MS
could be decomposed into two mixed Gaussian
distributions (fig. S11). We reasoned that dis-
pensable and essential genes exhibit different
MS distribution. Therefore, a binary variable pg
was used to model whether the gene g is dis-
pensable or not: pg = 1 corresponds to dispens-
able and vice versa. The probability of observing
a MSg of gene g is mixture of two Gaussian
distributions:
PðMSgÞ ¼
X
pg¼1;0PðpgÞNðMSgjmpg; spgÞ
X
pg¼1;0PðpgÞ ¼ 1
ð3Þ
Subsequently, the EM algorithm was imple-
mented to search for the optimized value of
parameters. The posterior distribution after
the EM optimization procedures could be
calculated as:
Pðpg ¼ 1jMSg; QÞ
¼
Pðpg ¼ 1ÞNðMSgjmpg¼1; spg¼1Þ
X
pg¼1;0PðpgÞNðMSgjmpg; spgÞ
ð4Þ
where Q is the parameter space. The MIS was
defined as the posterior distribution to be
dispensable.
MFS calculation
For the mutants that were subjected to com-
petitive growth essay, we calculated MFS to rep-
resent the comparative growth fitness of a mutant.
The QIseq sequencing reads distribution reflects
the fitness of unique piggyBac mutants in the
competitive-growth assays. The start and the
end of the growth assay could be represented as
t0 and t. At the end of the assay, am;v
t;g indicated
the relative abundance of each mutant m, tar-
geted into the CDS of gene g in sample v. There-
fore, the abundance of the mutant of the gene
g at the end of the assay could be represented
as
X
m∈vam;v
t;g . The
X

t;g was directly pro-
portional to the QIseq reads number
X

which is

starting with ‘TTAA’ were used to measure rm;v

To normalize different

Therefore, the MFS calculation based on individ-

growth fitness in in vitro blood stage.
GO analysis
All the Gene Ontology (GO) terms were down-
loaded from (http://plasmodb.org/plasmo/) (27).
For each specific GO term g, the MIS distribution
in the term g could be represented as MISg. The
number of genes in term g is Numg. We asked
whether the genes in the term g are more prone
to be dispensable or essential. To answer this
question, we compared the median value of MISg
with sampled data distribution as background.
The genes with the same number of Numg were
sampled out and represented as Sg. This proce-
dure was repeated 1000 times and the median
MIS of each Sg,t (t ∈ 1, 2, 3, ...1000) was calculated
as MISSg;t. The P value was calculated as
pg ¼

Here, I(·) is the indicator function.
Half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) estimation
To calculate IC50, the dose-response data (e.g.,
drug concentrations c1, c2, …cn and growth
inhibition q1, q2, … qn) were used to fit a Hill
Equation.
q ¼ U þ
U � D

where c was drug concentrations in logarithmic
form. The parameter C was the estimate of IC50.
The goodness of fit was calculated from dose-
response data and the Hill Equation.
