Abstract
Cryptococcus neoformans is one of the leading causes of invasive fungal infection in
humans worldwide. C. neoformans uses macrophages as a proliferative niche to increase
infective burden and avoid immune surveillance. However, the specific mechanisms by
which C. neoformans manipulates host immunity to promote its growth during infection
remain ill-defined. Here we demonstrate that eicosanoid lipid mediators manipulated and/or
produced by C. neoformans play a key role in regulating pathogenesis. C. neoformans is
known to secrete several eicosanoids that are highly similar to those found in vertebrate
hosts. Using eicosanoid deficient cryptococcal mutants Δplb1 and Δlac1, we demonstrate
that prostaglandin E2 is required by C. neoformans for proliferation within macrophages and
in vivo during infection. Genetic and pharmacological disruption of host PGE2 synthesis is
not required for promotion of cryptococcal growth by eicosanoid production. We find that
PGE2 must be dehydrogenated into 15-keto-PGE2 to promote fungal growth, a finding that
implicated the host nuclear receptor PPAR-γ. C. neoformans infection of macrophages acti-
vates host PPAR-γ and its inhibition is sufficient to abrogate the effect of 15-keto-PGE2 in
promoting fungal growth during infection. Thus, we describe the first mechanism of reliance
on pathogen-derived eicosanoids in fungal pathogenesis and the specific role of 15-keto-
PGE2 and host PPAR-γ in cryptococcosis.

 Author summary
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is responsible for signif-
icant numbers of deaths in the immunocompromised population worldwide. Here we
address whether eicosanoids produced by C. neoformans manipulate host innate immune
cells during infection. Cryptococcus neoformans produces several eicosanoids that are
notable for their similarity to vertebrate eicosanoids, it is therefore possible that fungal-
derived eicosanoids may provoke physiological effects in the host. Using a combination of
in vitro and in vivo infection models we identify a specific eicosanoid species—prostaglan-
din E2 –that is required by C. neoformans for growth during infection. We subsequently
show that prostaglandin E2 must be converted to 15-keto-prostaglandin E2 within the
host before it has these effects. Furthermore, we find that prostaglandin E2/15-keto-pros-
taglandin E2 mediated virulence is via activation of host PPAR-γ –an intracellular eicosa-
noid receptor known to interact with 15-keto-PGE2.
Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic pathogen that infects individuals who have severe
immunodeficiencies such as late-stage HIV AIDS. C. neoformans is estimated to infect 278,000
individuals each year resulting in 181,000 deaths [1, 2]. C. neoformans infection begins in the
lungs where the fungus is phagocytosed by host macrophages. Macrophages must become acti-
vated by further inflammatory signals from the host immune system before they can effectively
kill C. neoformans [3, 4]. When this does not occur C. neoformans proliferates rapidly intracel-
lularly and may use the macrophage to disseminate to the central nervous system leading to
fatal cryptococcal meningitis [5–9].
Eicosanoids are an important group of lipid inflammatory mediators produced by innate
immune cells such as macrophages. Eicosanoids are a diverse group of potent signalling mole-
cules that have a short range of action and signal through autocrine and paracrine routes. Mac-
rophages produce large amounts of a particular group of eicosanoids called prostaglandins
during microbial infection [10, 11]. Prostaglandins have a number of physiological effects
throughout the body, but in the context of immunity they are known to strongly influence the
inflammatory state [12]. The prostaglandins PGE2 and PGD2 are the best-studied eicosanoid
inflammatory mediators. During infection, macrophages produce both PGE2 and PGD2 to
which, via autocrine routes, they are highly responsive [12]. In vertebrate immunity, the syn-
thesis of eicosanoids such as PGE2 is carefully regulated by feedback loops to ensure that the
potent effects of these molecules are properly constrained. Exogenous sources of eicosanoids
within the body, such as from eicosanoid-producing parasites [13] or tumours that overpro-
duce eicosanoids [14, 15], can disrupt host inflammatory signaling as they are not subject to
the same regulation.
It is well known that C. neoformans produces its own eicosanoid species. These fungal-
derived eicosanoids are indistinguishable from those produced by vertebrates [16–18]. Only
two Cryptococcus enzymes are known to be associated with cryptococcal eicosanoid synthesis
—phospholipase B1 and laccase [18, 19]. Deletion of phospholipase B1 reduces secreted levels
of all eicosanoids produced by C. neoformans suggesting that it has high level role in eicosanoid
synthesis [19], perhaps fulfilling the role of phospholipase A2 in higher organisms. Deletion of
laccase results in reduced levels of PGE2 but other eicosanoids are unaffected suggesting that
laccase has putative PGE2 synthase activity [18]. C. neoformans produces eicosanoids during
infection, these eicosanoids are indistinguishable from host eicosanoids so it is possible that C.

 neoformans is able to manipulate the host inflammatory state during infection by directly
manipulating host eicosanoid signaling.
It has previously been reported that the inhibition of prostaglandin E2 receptors EP2 and
EP4 during murine pulmonary infection leads to better host survival accompanied by a shift
towards Th1/M1 macrophage activation, however it was not determined if PGE2 was derived
from the host or the fungus [20]. Therefore, a key aspect of C. neoformans pathogenesis
remains unanswered: do eicosanoids produced by C. neoformans manipulate host innate
immune cells function during infection?
We have previously shown that the eicosanoid deficient strain Δplb1 has reduced prolifera-
tion and survival within macrophages [21]. We hypothesised that eicosanoids produced by C.
neoformans support intracellular proliferation within macrophages and subsequently promote
pathogenesis. To address this hypothesis, we combined in vitro macrophage infection assays
with our previous published in vivo zebrafish model of cryptococcosis [22]. We found that
PGE2 was sufficient to promote growth of Δplb1 and Δlac1 independent of host PGE2 produc-
tion, in vitro and in vivo. We show that the effects of PGE2 in cryptococcal infection are medi-
ated by its dehydrogenated form, 15-keto-PGE2. Finally, we determine that 15-keto-PGE2
promotes C. neoformans infection via the activation of the host nuclear transcription factor
PPAR-γ, demonstrating that 15-keto-PGE2 and PPAR-γ are new factors in cryptococcal
infection.
Results
Prostaglandin E2 is required for C. neoformans growth in macrophages
We have previously shown that the C. neoformans mutant strain Δplb1 has impaired prolifera-
tion and survival within J774 murine macrophages in vitro [21]. The Δplb1 strain has a dele-
tion in the PLB1 gene which codes for the secreted enzyme phospholipase B1 [23]. The Δplb1
strain is known to produce lower levels of fungal eicosanoids indicating that phospholipase B1
is involved in fungal eicosanoid synthesis [19]. It has been proposed that the attenuation of
this strain within macrophages could be because it cannot produce eicosanoids [19]. A previ-
ous study has identified PGE2 as an eicosanoid that promotes cryptococcal virulence and
manipulates macrophage activation, however this study did not determine if PGE2 was pro-
duced by the host or C. neoformans [20]. We hypothesised that PGE2—or other phospholipase
B1 derived eicosanoid species—are produced by C. neoformans during infection and promote
macrophage infection.
To test if PGE2 promotes the intracellular growth of C. neoformans we treated Δplb1
infected J774 macrophages with exogenous PGE2 and measured intracellular proliferation
over 18 hours. The addition of exogenous PGE2 to J774 macrophages infected with Δplb1 was
sufficient to recover the intracellular proliferation of Δplb1 compared to the H99 (parental
wild type strain) and Δplb1:PLB1 (PLB1 reconstituted ‘rescue’ strain) strains (Fig 1 p = 0.038).
These findings support our initial hypothesis and identify PGE2 as a mediator of cryptococcal
virulence during macrophage infection.
We have previously shown that Δplb1 has reduced intracellular proliferation due to a com-
bination of reduced cell division and reduced viability within the phagosome [21]. In our
intracellular proliferation assay the number of intracellular Cryptococcus cells is quantified by
lysing infected macrophage and counting the number of Cryptococcus cells with a hemocytom-
eter. Due to their structurally stable fungal cell wall, dead or dying Cryptococcus cells do not
look noticeably different on a hemocytometer from viable cells. To quantifiy the viability of
Cryptococcus cells retrieved from the phagosome we diluted the lysate to give an expected
number of CFUs (in this case 200 CFU), spread the diluted lysate on YPD agar and count the

 actual number of CFUs produced–a difference between the expected CFU count (200 CFU)
and the actual CFU count indicates a loss of Cryptococcus cell viability. In this case viability
assays showed that exogenous PGE2 produced no significant increase in the viability of Δplb1
cells within the phagosome (S1A Fig).
Exogenous prostaglandin E2 rescues in vivo growth of Δplb1-GFP
Our in vitro data showed that PGE2 promoted the intracellular proliferation of C. neoformans
within macrophages. To confirm this in vivo, we injected 2-day post fertilisation (dpf) zebra-
fish larvae with Δplb1-GFP (a constitutively expressed GFP tagged version of the Δplb1 gener-
ated for this study). One of the advantages of this model is that the fungal burden can be non-
invasively imaged within infected larvae using fluorescently tagged C. neoformans strains and
we able measure the growth of the fungus at 1-, 2- and 3-days post-infection (dpi). We found
that Δplb1-GFP infected larvae had significantly lower fungal burdens at 1-, 2- and 3-days post
infection (Fig 2D and S1B Fig) compared to the parental strain H99-GFP (Fig 2A and S1B
Fig). These data demonstrated that the Δplb1-GFP mutant had a similar growth deficiency to
our in vitro phenotype and with previous studies [21, 23, 24]. To confirm that PGE2 promotes

 cryptococcal infection in vivo we infected zebrafish larvae with Δplb1-GFP or H99-GFP and
treated the larvae with exogenous PGE2. In agreement with our in vitro findings (Fig 1), exoge-
nous PGE2 increased the growth of both the parental H99 strain (Fig 2B, p = 0.0137, 1.35-fold
increase vs. DMSO) and the Δplb1-GFP mutant (Fig 2E, p = 0.0001, 2.15-fold increase vs.
DMSO) while PGD2 did not (Fig 2C and 2F). Taken together these data show that PGE2 is suf-
ficient to enhance the virulence of C. neoformans in vivo, furthermore our in vitro data suggest
that this is a result of uncontrolled intracellular proliferation within macrophages (Fig 1).
Prostaglandin E2 must be dehydrogenated into 15-keto-PGE2 to promote
C. neoformans growth
PGE2 can be enzymatically and non-enzymatically modified in cells to form a number of dis-
tinct metabolites. To distinguish the biological activity of PGE2 rather than its metabolites we
used an analogue of PGE2 called 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 that cannot be dehydrogenated but oth-
erwise has comparable activity to PGE2 [25]). We found that unlike PGE2, 16,16-dimethyl
PGE2 treatment did not increase the fungal burden of Δplb1-GFP (Fig 3C p = 0.9782) or
H99-GFP infected larvae (Fig 3A p = 0.9954). Therefore, the biological activity of PGE2 alone
did not appear to promote cryptococcal pathogenesis suggesting that dehydrogenation of
PGE2 was required. PGE2 and 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 both signal through PGE2 receptors (EP1,
EP2, EP3 and EP4) but 15-keto-PGE2 does not. In a murine model of pulmonary cryptococco-
sis the PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4 have been identified as promoters of fungal virulence [20].
To confirm that PGE2 itself does not promote virulence in our model we treated zebrafish with
antagonists against the EP2 and EP4 receptors. In support of our previous experiment we
found that EP2 / EP4 inhibition had no effect on fungal burden in zebrafish (Fig 3E). An abun-
dant dehydrogenated form of PGE2 is 15-keto-PGE2 (that has also been isolated from C. neo-
formans [18]) and we tested if 15-keto-PGE2 was sufficient to rescue the growth defect of the
Δplb1 mutant during infection. Therefore, we treated infected zebrafish larvae with exogenous
15-keto-PGE2 and found that this was sufficient to significantly increase the fungal burden of
zebrafish larvae infected with both Δplb1-GFP (Fig 3D, p = 0.0119, 1.56-fold increase vs.
DMSO) and H99-GFP (Fig 3B, p = 0.0048, 1.36-fold increase vs. DMSO). To explore the Cryp-
tococcus eicosanoid synthesis pathway further we used a second eicosanoid deficient C. neofor-
mans mutant Δlac1. Whereas Δplb1 is unable to produce any eicosanoid species Δlac1 is
deficient only in PGE2 and 15-keto-PGE2 [18]. Using a Δlac1-GFP strain generated for this
study we found that Δlac1-GFP also produced low fungal burden during in vivo zebrafish lar-
vae infection (S2B Fig). As with Δplb1-GFP, this defect could be rescued with the addition of
exogenous PGE2 (S2C Fig), but not with 16,16-dm-PGE2 (S2D Fig) or with 15-keto-PGE2
(S2E Fig). PGE2 is known to affect haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis in zebrafish [26].

 This could affect macrophage number and subsequently fungal burden. We have previously
observed that a large depletion of macrophages can lead to increased fungal burden in zebra-
fish larvae [22]. We performed whole body macrophage counts on 2 dpf uninfected larvae
treated with PGE2 or 15-keto-PGE2 2 days post treatment (the same time points used in our
infection assay). Following PGE2 and 15-keto PGE2 treatment macrophages were still observ-
able throughout the larvae. For PGE2 treatment we saw on average a 15% reduction in macro-
phage number while 15-keto PGE2 did not cause any decrease (S1C Fig). Due to the fact that
fungal burden increased during both PGE2 and 15-keto PGE2 treatments it is highly unlikely
that this reduction could account for the increases in burden seen.
Host derived prostaglandins are not required for growth of C. neoformans
After determining that PGE2 promotes the growth of C. neoformans in vitro and in vivo via its
metabolite 15-keto-PGE2, we wanted to determine whether the source of these prostaglandins
was the host or the fungus. Our in vitro data show that the C. neoformans strain Δplb1 has a
growth deficiency in vitro and in vivo that can be rescued with the addition of PGE2, because
this phenotype is mediated by cryptococcal phospholipase B1 it indicates that pathogen-
derived rather than host-derived prostaglandins are required. A previous study reports that C.
neoformans infection can induce higher PGE2 levels in the lung during in vivo pulmonary
infection of mice [20], although it was not determined if the PGE2 was host or pathogen
derived. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that host prostaglandin synthesis was not required
for cryptococcal virulence.
To block host prostaglandin synthesis in vitro we inhibited host cyclooxygenase activity
because it is essential for prostaglandin synthesis in vertebrates [27]. We treated H99 and
Δplb1 infected J774 macrophages with aspirin at a concentration we determined was sufficient
to block host PGE2 synthesis (S3A Fig). Aspirin is a non-reversible inhibitor of cyclooxygen-
ase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes, we therefore included a condition
where J774 cells were pretreated with aspirin only prior to infection and then at a condition
where aspirin was present throughout infection. We found that aspirin treatment did not affect
the intracellular proliferation of H99 or Δplb1 (Fig 4A), suggesting that host cyclooxygenase
activity is not required for the phospholipase B1 dependent virulence of C. neoformans during
macrophage infection. To confirm this in vivo, we pharmacologically blocked zebrafish COX-
1 and COX-2. We used separate cyclooxygenase inhibitors with zebrafish larvae instead of

ings were different to what we had observed in vitro but because this phenotype was phospho-
lipase B1 dependent we reasoned that these inhibitors could be having off target effects on C.
neoformans.C. neoformans does not have a homolog to cyclooxygenase however other studies
have tried to inhibit eicosanoid production in Cryptococcus using cyclooxygenase inhibitors
but their efficacy and target remain uncertain [17, 28]. To support our pharmacological evi-
dence, we used a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of the prostaglandin E2 synthase gene
(ptges) [29]. We used a knockdown of tyrosinase (tyr)–a gene involved in the conversion of
tyrosine into melanin as a control because tyr-/- crispants are easy to identify because they do
not produce any pigment. We infected 2 dpf ptges-/- and tyr-/- zebrafish larvae with H99-GFP
or Δplb1-GFP and measured the fungal burden at 3 dpi. We found that ptges-/- zebrafish
infected with H99-GFP had a higher fungal burden at 3 dpi compared to tyr-/- zebrafish
infected with H99-GFP whereas there was no difference between ptges-/- and tyr-/- zebrafish
larvae infected with Δplb1-GFP (Fig 4C). Thus, both pharmacological and genetic inhibitions
of host prostaglandin synthesis were not determinants of C. neoformans growth.
Phospholipase B1 dependent factors are sufficient to support Δplb1 growth
in macrophages
To further evidence that C. neoformans was the source of PGE2 during macrophage infection
we used a co-infection assay which has previously been used to investigate the interaction of
different C. gattii strains within the same macrophage [30]. We hypothesised that if C. neofor-
mans derived prostaglandins promoted fungal growth, co-infection between H99 and Δplb1

 would support mutant growth within macrophages because the parental strain H99 would
produce growth promoting prostaglandins that are lacking in Δplb1. To produce co-infection,
J774 murine macrophages were infected with a 50:50 mixture of Δplb1 and H99-GFP [30] (Fig
4Ei; as described previously for C. gattii [30]). This approach allowed us to differentiate
between Δplb1 (GFP negative) and H99 (GFP positive) Cryptococcus strains within the same
macrophage and to score their proliferation separately. The intracellular proliferation of Δplb1
was calculated by counting the change in number of GFP negative Δplb1 cells over an 18hr
period from time-lapse movies of infected cells. We found that co-infected macrophages did
not always contain an equal ratio of each strain at the start of the 18hr period so we scored the
proliferation of Δplb1 for a range of initial burdens (1:2, 1:3 and 1:4). We found that Δplb1 pro-
liferated better when accompanied by two H99-GFP yeast cells in the same macrophage (Fig
4Eii, 1:2 p = 0.014) as opposed to when two Δplb1 yeast cells were accompanied by one
H99-GFP yeast cell (Fig 4Eii, 2:1). We observed a similar effect for ratios of 1:3 and 1:4, but
these starting burden ratios are particularly rare, under powering our analysis (S3 Fig). This
effect was also recapitulated for J774 macrophages co-infected with Δlac1 and H99-GFP (S2A
Fig). These data indicate that a phospholipase B1 dependent factor found in H99 infected mac-
rophages, but absent in Δplb1 and Δlac1 infected macrophages, is required for intracellular
proliferation within macrophages.
Production of PGE2 by macrophages is not altered by C. neoformans
infection
Our data indicate that host cells are not the source of virulence promoting prostaglandins, and
that secreted factors produced by wild type—but not Δplb1 or Δlac1 Cryptococcus strains–promote
fungal growth within macrophages. We wanted to test if there were detectable differences in
PGE2 levels between infected and uninfected macrophages caused by cryptococcal prostaglandin
synthesis. To do this we performed ELISA analysis to detect PGE2 concentrations in supernatants
from C. neoformans infected J774 macrophages (Fig 4Di). We found that J774 macrophages pro-
duced detectable levels of PGE2 (mean concentration 4.10 ng/1x106 cells), however we did not see
any significant difference between infected or uninfected macrophages (infected with H99, Δplb1
or Δplb1:PLB1 strains). To confirm our ELISA results, we performed LC MS/MS analysis of lysed
J774 macrophages using a PGE2 standard for accurate quantification (Fig 4Dii). The concentra-
tions detected were similar to those measured by our ELISA (mean concentration 6.35 ng/1X106
cells) and also did not show any significant differences between conditions. Taken together these
data suggest that any Cryptococcus-derived prostaglandins present during infection were likely to
be contained within the macrophage in low, localized concentrations and that the host receptor
targeted by these eicosanoids is therefore likely to be intracellular.
15-keto-PGE2 promotes C. neoformans growth by activating host PPAR-γ
We next wanted to determine how PGE2 / 15-keto-PGE2 promotes C. neoformans infection.
We hypothesized that these prostaglandins were interfering with inhibition of fungal growth
via a host receptor. Our experiments inhibiting EP2 / EP4 suggest that 15-keto-PGE2 must sig-
nal through a different receptor to PGE2 (Fig 3E). 15-keto-PGE2 is a known agonist of the per-
oxisome proliferation associated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) [31]; a transcription factor that
controls expression of many inflammation related genes [32–34]. We first tested if PPAR-γ
activation occurs within macrophages during C. neoformans infection by performing immu-
nofluorescent staining for PPAR-γ in macrophages infected with H99 and Δplb1. To quantify
PPAR-γ activation we measured its nuclear translocation by comparing nuclear and cyto-
plasmic fluorescence intensity in infected cells. PPAR-γ is a cytosolic receptor that translocates

 to the nucleus upon activation, therefore cells where PPAR-γ is activated should have
increased nuclear staining for PPAR-γ. We found that J774 macrophages infected with H99
had significantly higher levels of nuclear staining for PPAR-γ compared to Δplb1 infected and
uninfected cells (Fig 5Ai and S3C Fig). This confirmed that C. neoformans activates PPAR-γ
and that this phenotype is phospholipase B1 dependent.
To test the activation of PPAR-γ during infection we first wanted to confirm that exogenous
15-keto-PGE2 activates zebrafish PPAR-γ in vivo by using transgenic PPAR-γ reporter zebra-
fish larvae [35, 36]. We treated these larvae at 2 dpf with 15-keto-PGE2 and Troglitazone
(TLT) which is a specific agonist of PPAR-γ. TLT treatment was performed with a concentra-
tion (0.55 μM) previously shown to strongly activate PPAR-γ in these zebrafish larvae [35]. We
found that TLT treatment at 2 dpf strongly activated GFP reporter expression in the larvae.
We employed a receptor competition assay as a sensitive measurement of binding by simulta-
neously treating zebrafish with with 15-keto-PGE2 and TLT. We observed a reduction in GFP
expression compared to TLT treatment alone (Fig 5Aii), demonstrating competition for the
same receptor. This could mean that 15-keto-PGE2 was a partial agonist [37, 38] or an antago-
nist to PPAR-γ in this experiment. Existing studies suggest 15-keto-PGE2 is an agonist to
PPAR-γ [31] but to confirm this in our model we treated Δplb1-GFP infected zebrafish larvae
with exogenous 15-keto-PGE2 as before but at the same time treated fish with the PPAR-γ
antagonist GW9662. We found that 15-keto-PGE2 treatment significantly improved the
growth of Δplb1-GFP during infection but that inhibition of PPAR-γ was sufficient to reverse
this effect (Fig 5C). Therefore, we could demonstrate that that 15-keto-PGE2 was an agonist to
PPAR-γ, and that PPAR-γ activation was sufficient to promote a permissive environment for
C. neoformans growth during infection.
To determine if PPAR-γ activation by C. neoformans facilitates growth within macrophages
we treated H99 and Δplb1 infected J774 murine macrophages with the PPAR-γ antagonist
GW9662. GW9662 treatment significantly reduced the proliferation of H99, but not Δplb1
(Fig 5B, p = 0.026, 1.22-fold decrease vs. DMSO). Further supporting that PPAR-γ activation
is necessary for the successful intracellular parasitism of host macrophages by C. neoformans.
Finally, to confirm that PPAR-γ activation alone promoted C. neoformans infection we treated
2dpf infected zebrafish larvae with TLT at the same concentration known to activate PPAR-γ
in PPAR-γ reporter fish (Fig 5Aii and [35]). We found that TLT treatment significantly
increased the fungal burden of Δplb1-GFP (Fig 5E and, p = 0.0089, 1.68-fold increase vs.
DMSO), H99-GFP (Fig 5D, p = 0.0044, 1.46-fold increase vs. DMSO) and Δlac1-GFP (Fig 5F,
p = 0.01, 1.94-fold increase vs. DMSO) infected larvae similar to 15-keto-PGE2 treatment.
Thus, we could show that host PPAR-γ activation was sufficient to promote cryptococcal
growth during infection and was a consequence of fungal derived prostaglandins.
Discussion
We have shown for the first time that eicosanoids produced by C. neoformans promote fungal
virulence both in vitro and in vivo. In this respect we have shown that the intracellular growth
defects of two eicosanoid deficient C. neoformans strains Δplb1 and Δlac1 [21, 23] can be res-
cued with the addition of exogenous PGE2. Furthermore, our in vitro co-infection assay, in
vitro infection assays with aspirin, and in vivo infection assays provide evidence that the source
of this eicosanoid during infection is from the pathogen, rather than the host. Using an in vivo
zebrafish larvae model of cryptococcosis we find that that PGE2 must be dehydrogenated into
15-keto-PGE2 before to influence fungal growth. Finally, we provide evidence that the mecha-
nism of PGE2/15-keto-PGE2 mediated growth promotion during larval infection is via the
activation of PPAR-γ [32, 33, 39–41].

 In a previous study it was identified that the C. neoformans mutant Δplb1 (that lacks the
PLB1 gene coding for phospholipase B1) was deficient in replication and survival in macro-
phages [21], a phenotype also observed by a number of studies using different in vitro infection
assays [19, 23]. In this study we demonstrate that supplementing Δplb1 with exogenous prosta-
glandin E2 during in vitro macrophages infection is sufficient to restore the mutant’s intracel-
lular proliferation defect. A key goal of this study was to investigate how eicosanoids produced
by C. neoformans modulate pathogenesis in vivo [22]. To facilitate in vivo measurement of fun-
gal burden we created two GFP-tagged strains with constitutive GFP expression - Δplb1-GFP
and Δlac1-GFP—to use alongside the GFP-tagged H99 parental strain previously produced
[42]. These two mutants are the only C. neoformans mutants known to have a deficiency in
eicosanoid synthesis. Δplb1 cannot produce any eicosanoid species suggesting phospholipase
B1 is high in the eicosanoid synthesis pathway while Δlac1 has a specific defect in PGE2 sug-
gesting it might be a prostaglandin E2 synthase enzyme. To our knowledge these are the first
GFP expressing strains of Δplb1 and Δlac1 created. Characterisation of Δplb1-GFP and Δlac1-
GFP in vivo revealed that both strains have significantly reduced fungal burdens compared to
H99-GFP. This is the first report of Δlac1 in zebrafish but these observations do confirm a pre-
vious zebrafish study showing that non-fluorescent Δplb1 had attenuated infectious burden in
zebrafish larvae [43]. To confirm that PGE2 is also required for cryptococcal growth in vivo we
treated Δplb1-GFP and Δlac1-GFP infected zebrafish larvae with exogenous PGE2 to determine
how it would affect fungal burden. In agreement with our in vitro findings we found that PGE2
significantly improved the growth of both of these strains within larvae. Interestingly we also
found that PGE2 improved the growth of H99-GFP, perhaps representing a wider manipula-
tion of host immunity during in vivo infection.
In vertebrate cells, PGE2 is converted into 15-keto-PGE2 by the enzyme 15-prostaglandin
dehydrogenase (15PGDH), furthermore it has been reported that C. neoformans has enzymatic
activity analogous to 15PGDH [18]. To investigate how the dehydrogenation of PGE2 to
15-keto-PGE2 influenced fungal burden we treated infected larvae with 16,16-dm-PGE2 –a
synthetic variant of PGE2 which is resistant to dehydrogenation [25]. Interestingly we found
that 16,16-dm-PGE2 was unable to promote the growth of Δplb1-GFP, H99-GFP or Δlac1-GFP

 within infected larvae. These findings indicate that 15-keto-PGE2, rather than PGE2, promotes
cryptococcal virulence. We subsequently treated infected larvae with exogenous 15-keto-PGE2
and confirmed that 15-keto-PGE2 treatment was sufficient to promote the growth of both
Δplb1-GFP and H99-GFP, but not Δlac1-GFP (discussed below), without the need for PGE2.
We therefore propose that PGE2 produced by C. neoformans during infection must be enzy-
matically dehydrogenated into 15-keto-PGE2 to promote cryptococcal virulence. These find-
ings represent the identification of a new virulence factor (15-keto-PGE2) produced by C.
neoformans, as well as the first-time identification of an eicosanoid other than PGE2 with a
role in promoting cryptococcal growth. Furthermore, our findings suggest that previous stud-
ies which identify PGE2 as a promoter of cryptococcal virulence [19, 20, 44] may have observed
additive effects from both PGE2 and 15-keto-PGE2 activity.
Our experiments with the Δlac1-GFP strain reveals that this strain appears to respond in a
similar way to PGE2, 16,16-dm-PGE2 and troglitazone as Δplb1-GFP but appears to be unre-
sponsive to 15-keto-PGE2. At this time, we cannot fully explain this phenotype, Δlac1-GFP
was generally less responsive to PGE2 and troglitazone treatments compared to Δplb1-GFP so
it is possible that that higher concentrations of 15-keto-PGE2 would be needed to rescue its
growth defect, however experimentation with higher concentrations of 15-keto-PGE2 led to
significant host toxicity. The unresponsiveness of Δlac1 to eicosanoid treatment could be due
to unrelated virulence defects caused by laccase deficiency. Cryptococcal laccase expression is
required for the production of fungal melanin–a well characterized virulence factor produced
by C. neoformans [45, 46]. It is therefore likely that virulence defects unrelated to eicosanoid
synthesis are responsible for the differences between the two mutant phenotypes.
We have found that the phospholipase B1 dependent attenuation of Δplb1 can be rescued
with the addition of exogenous PGE2. This indicates that synthesis and secretion of PGE2 by C.
neoformans is a virulence factor. Although our data indicated that C. neoformans was the
source of PGE2 we wanted exclude the possibility that host-derived PGE2 was also contributing
to virulence. To explore this possibility, we blocked host prostaglandin synthesis—we reasoned
that if host PGE2 was not required that blocking its production would not affect the growth of
C. neoformans. To do this we first treated J774 macrophages infected with H99-GFP and
Δplb1-GFP with aspirin–a cyclooxygenase inhibitor that blocks both COX-1 and COX-2 activ-
ity–and found that this had no effect on intracellular proliferation. Subsequently we attempted
to block cyclooxygenase activity in zebrafish but found aspirin was lethal at the zebrafish lar-
vae’s currently stage of development, instead we used individual inhibitors specific for COX-1
(NS-398) and COX-2 (SC-560). We found that each inhibitor decreases fungal burden of
H99-GFP infected larvae but not Δplb1-GFP infected larvae. Due to the phospholipase B1
dependence of this phenotype we think that these inhibitors might be affecting eicosanoid pro-
duction by the C. neoformans itself. The ability of broad COX inhibitors like aspirin/indometh-
acin to inhibit eicosanoid production by C. neoformans is controversial [17, 28] however our
study is the first to use selective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors on C. neoformans. This experi-
ment remained inconclusive as to whether host PGE2 synthesis promotes virulence so to block
PGE2 in zebrafish larvae without potential off target effects we used CRISPR Cas9 technology
to knockdown expression of the prostaglandin E2 synthase gene ptges in zebrafish larvae.
Ablating zebrafish ptges with this approach did not affect the fungal burden of Δplb1-GFP
infected larvae but it did cause increased burden in H99-GFP infected zebrafish. This pheno-
type is interesting because it suggests host PGE2 might actually be inhibitory to cryptococcal
virulence, furthermore this phenotype was phospholipase B1 dependent which suggests host-
derived PGE2 might interact in some way with Cryptococcus-derived eicosanoids. This pheno-
type was not seen in vitro with aspirin so it is possible that the inhibitory effects of host-derived
PGE2 influence a non-macrophage cell type in zebrafish larvae.

 To confirm our observations that C. neoformans was the source of PGE2 during infection
we performed co-infection assays with H99 wild type cryptococci (eicosanoid producing) and
Δplb1 (eicosanoid deficient) within the same macrophage and found that co-infection was suf-
ficient to promote the intracellular growth of Δplb1. We also observed similar interactions dur-
ing Δlac1 co-infection (a second eicosanoid deficient C. neoformans mutant). These
observations agree with previous studies that suggest eicosanoids are virulence factors pro-
duced by C. neoformans during macrophage infection [19, 28]. To identify if the secreted fac-
tor produced by C. neoformans was PGE2, we measured the levels of PGE2 from Cryptococcus
infected macrophages to see if there was an observable increase in this eicosanoid during infec-
tion. Although PGE2 was detected, we did not see any significant difference between infected
and uninfected macrophages, an observation confirmed using two different detection tech-
niques–ELISA and LC MS/MS. These data suggest that PGE2 produced by C. neoformans dur-
ing macrophage infection is contained within the macrophage, likely in close proximity to the
fungus and that the host receptor targeted by these eicosanoids is therefore likely to be intracel-
lular. Our in vitro co-infection experiments indicate that C. neoformans secretes virulence
enhancing eicosanoids during infection.
The biological activity of 15-keto-PGE2 is far less studied than PGE2. It is known that
15-keto-PGE2 cannot bind to prostaglandin E2 EP receptors, this means it can act as a negative
regulator of PGE2 activity i.e. cells up-regulate 15PGDH activity to lower PGE2 levels [47]. Our
findings however suggested that 15-keto-PGE2 did have a biological activity independent of
PGE2 synthesis, possibly via a distinct eicosanoid receptor. It has been demonstrated that
15-keto-PGE2 can activate the intracellular eicosanoid receptor peroxisome proliferator associ-
ated receptor gamma (PPAR- γ) [31]. Activation of PPAR-γ by C. neoformans has not been
described previously but it is compatible with what we know of cryptococcal pathogenesis.
PPAR-γ is a nuclear receptor normally found within the cytosol. Upon ligand binding PPAR-γ
forms a heterodimer with Retinoid X receptor (RXR) and translocates to the nucleus where it
influences the expression of target genes which possess a peroxisome proliferation hormone
response element (PPRE) [48]. If eicosanoids are produced by C. neoformans during intracel-
lular infection, it is likely that they bind to an intracellular eicosanoid receptor. Additionally,
activation of PPAR-γ within macrophages is known to promote the expression of anti-inflam-
matory genes which could make the macrophage more amenable to parasitism by the fungus.
To investigate whether PPAR-γ activation within macrophages occurs during C. neofor-
mans infection we performed immunofluorescent staining of H99 and Δplb1 infected J774
macrophages. We found that infection with C. neoformans led to increased nuclear localization
of PPAR- γ indicating that the fungus was activating endogenous PPAR- γ during infection.
We also found that macrophages infected with H99 had higher levels of PPAR- γ activation
than Δplb1 infected macrophages. This strongly suggests that eicosanoids produced by C. neo-
formans are responsible for activating PPAR- γ.
To confirm that 15-keto-PGE2 is an agonist to PPAR-γ we performed experiments with
zebrafish larvae from PPAR-γ GFP reporter fish [35] and demonstrated that 15-keto-PGE2
binds to zebrafish PPAR- γ. To determine if 15-keto-PGE2 is an agonist to PPAR- γ we found
that treating Δplb1-GFP infected zebrafish larvae with GW9662 at the same time as 15-keto-
PGE2 blocked the virulence enhancing effects of the eicosanoid. These data indicate that
15-keto-PGE2 is a partial agonist to PPAR-γ (in zebrafish at least). Partial agonists are weak
agonists that bind to and activate receptors, but not at the same efficacy as a full agonist. Partial
agonists to PPAR-γ have been reported previously, partial PPAR agonists bind to the ligand
binding domain of PPAR-γ with a lower affinity than full PPAR agonists and as a result acti-
vate smaller subsets of PPAR-γ controlled genes [37, 38, 49–52].

 We also found that activation of PPAR-γ alone was sufficient to mediate cryptococcal viru-
lence. In this respect, we found that the in vitro intracellular proliferation of the wild type H99
cryptococcal strain within J774 macrophages could be suppressed using a PPAR-γ antagonist
GW9662. We could also block the rescuing effect of 15-keto-PGE2 on Δplb1-GFP during zeb-
rafish infection using GW9662. Finally we found that Cryptococcus infected zebrafish treated
with troglitazone at a concentration that is known to activate PPAR-γ [35] had increased fun-
gal burdens when infected with Δplb1-GFP, Δlac1-GFP and H99-GFP strains. Taken together
these experiments provide convincing evidence that a novel cryptococcal virulence factor—
15-keto-PGE2 –enhances the virulence of C. neoformans by activation of host PPAR-γ and that
macrophages are one of the key targets of this eicosanoid during infection.
In this study, we have shown for the first time that eicosanoids produced by C. neoformans
can promote virulence in an in vivo host. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that this
virulence occurs via eicosanoid mediated manipulation of host macrophages. We have identi-
fied that the eicosanoid responsible for these effects is 15-keto-PGE2 which is derived from the
dehydrogenation of PGE2 produced by C. neoformans. We have subsequently demonstrated
that 15-keto-PGE2 mediates its effects via activation of PPAR- γ, an intracellular eicosanoid
receptor known to promote anti-inflammatory immune pathways within macrophages. We
provide compelling evidence that eicosanoids produced by C. neoformans enhance virulence,
identifies a novel virulence factor– 15-keto-PGE2 –and describes a novel mechanism of host
manipulation by C. neoformans—activation of PPAR- γ. Most importantly this study provides
a potential new therapeutic pathway for treatment of cryptococcal infection, as several eicosa-
noid modulating drugs are approved for patient treatment [53].

Ethics statement
Animal work was performed following UK law: Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986,
under Project License PPL 40/3574 and P1A4A7A5E. Ethical approval was granted by the Uni-
versity of Sheffield Local Ethical Review Panel. Experiments using the PPAR-γ reporter fish
line [35] were conducted at the University of Toronto following approved animal protocols (#
00000698 “A live zebrafish-based screening system for human nuclear receptor ligand and
cofactor discovery”) under a OMAFRA certificate.
Zebrafish
The following zebrafish strains were used for this study: Nacre wild type strain, Tg(mpeg1:
mCherryCAAX)sh378) transgenic strain [22] and the double mutant casper, for PPARγ
reporter experiments [35], which lacks all melanophores and iridophores [54]. Zebrafish were
maintained according to standard protocols. Adult fish were maintained on a 14:10 –hour
light / dark cycle at 28 oC in UK Home Office approved facilities in the Bateson Centre aquaria
at the University of Sheffield.
C. neoformans
The H99-GFP strain has been previously described [42]. The Δplb1-GFP and Δlac1-GFP stains
was generated for this study by transforming existing deletion mutant strains [23, 55] with a
GFP expression construct (see below for transformation protocol). All strains used are in the
C. neoformans variety grubii H99 genetic background.

 Cryptococcus strains were grown for 18 hours at 28 oC, rotating horizontally at 20 rpm.
Cryptococcus cultures were pelleted at 3300g for 1 minute, washed twice with PBS (Oxoidm
Basingstoke, UK) and re-suspended in 1ml PBS. Washed cells were then counted with a hae-
mocytometer and used as described below.
C. neoformans transformation
C. neoformans strains Δplb1 and Δlac1 were biolistically transformed using the pAG32_GFP
transformation construct as previously described for H99-GFP [42]. Stable transformants were
identified by passaging positive GFP fluorescent colonies for at least 3 passages on YPD agar
supplemented with 250 μg/ml Hygromycin B.
Zebrafish CRISPR
CRISPR generation was performed as previously described [29]. Briefly gRNA spanning the
ATG start codon of zebrafish ptges or tyr was injected along with Cas9 protein and tracrRNA
into zebrafish embryos at the single cell stage. Crispant larvae were infected with C. neofor-
mans as described above at 2 dpf. The genotype of each larvae was confirmed post assay–geno-
mic DNA was extracted from each larvae and the ATG was PCR amplified with primers
spanning the ATG site of ptges (Forward primer gccaagtataatgaggaatggg, Reverse primer
aatgtttggattaaacgcgact) producing a 345-bp product. This product was digest with Mwol–wild-
type digests produced bands at 184, 109 and 52 bp while mutant digests produced bands at 293
and 52 bp (S4 Fig).
J774 Macrophage infection–with exogenous PGE2 treatment
J774 macrophage (J774 cells were obtained from the ATCC, American Type Culture Collec-
tion) infection was performed as previously described [21] with the following alterations. J774
murine macrophage-like cells were cultured for a minimum of 4 passages in T75 tissue culture
flasks at 37 oC 5% CO2 in DMEM (High glucose, Sigma) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine
Calf Serum (Invitrogen), 1% 10,000 units Penicillin / 10 mg/ml streptomycin and 1% 200 mM/
L–glutamine, fully confluent cells were used for each experiment. Macrophages were counted
by haemocytometer and diluted to a concentration of 1x105 cells per ml in DMEM supple-
mented with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS from E. coli, Sigma L2630) before being plated
into 24 well microplates (Greiner) and incubated for 24 hours (37 oC 5% CO2).
Following 24-hour incubation, medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml DMEM sup-
plemented with 2 nM prostaglandin E2 (CAY14010, 1mg/ml stock in 100% ethanol). Macro-
phage wells were then infected with 100 μl 1x106 yeast/ml Cryptococcus cells (from overnight
culture, washed. See above) opsonized with anti-capsular IgG monoclonal antibody (18b7, a
kind gift from Arturo Casadevall). Cells were incubated for 2 hours (37 oC 5% CO2) and then
washed with 37 oC PBS until extracellular yeast were removed. After washing, infected cells
were treated with 1ml DMEM supplemented with PGE2.
To calculate IPR, replicate wells for each treatment/strain were counted at 0 and 18 hours.
Each well was washed once with 1ml 37 oC PBS prior to counting to remove any Cryptococcus
cells released by macrophage death or vomocytosis. Intra-macrophage Cryptococci were
released by lysis with 200 μl dH2O for 20 minutes (lysis confirmed under microscope). Lysate
was removed to a clean microcentrifuge tube and an additional 200 μl was used to wash the
well to make a total lysate volume of 400 μl. Cryptoccoccus cells within lysates were counted by
haemocytometer. IPR was calculated by dividing the total number of counted yeast at 18hr by
the total at 0hr.

 To assess the viability of C. neoformans cells recovered from macrophages we used our pre-
viously published colony forming unit (CFU) viability assay [21]. Lysates from C. neoformans
infected J774 cells were prepared from cells at 0hr and 18hr time points. The concentration of
C. neoformans cells in the lysate was calculated by haemocytomter counting, the lysates were
then diluted to give an expected concentration of 2x103 yeast cells per ml. 100 μl of this diluted
lysate was spread onto a YPD agar plate and incubated for 48 hr at 25 oC prior to colony
counting.
J774 Macrophage co-infection
J774 cells were prepared and seeded at a concentration of 1x105 per ml as above in 24 well
microplates and incubated for 24 hours (37 oC 5% CO2), 45 minutes prior to infection J774
cells were activated with 150 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in DMSO added to 1 ml
serum free DMEM. Following activation J774 cells were washed and infected with 100 μl /
1x106 yeast cells/ml 50:50 mix of Δplb1 (non-fluorescent) and H99-GFP (e.g. 5x105 Δplb1 and
5x105 H99-GFP) or Δlac1-GFP and H99 (non-fluorescent). Infected cells were incubated for 2
hours (37 oC 5% CO2) to allow for phagocytosis of Cryptococcus and then washed multiple
times with 37 oC PBS to remove unphagocytosed yeast, each well was observed between washes
to ensure that macrophages were not being washed away. After washing 1 ml DMEM was
added to each well.
Co-infected cells were imaged over 20 hours using a Nikon TE2000 microscope fitted with
a climate controlled incubation chamber (37 oC 5% CO2) using a Digital Sight DS-QiMC cam-
era and a Plan APO Ph1 20x objective lens (Nikon). GFP and bright field images were captured
every 4 minutes for 20 hours. Co-infection movies were scored manually. For example co-
infected macrophages that contained two Δplb1 (non-fluorescent) and one H99-GFP (GFP
positive) yeast cells at 0 hr were tracked for 18 hours and before the burden of each strain
within the macrophage was counted again. The IPR for Δplb1 within co-infected macrophages
was calculated by dividing the number of Δplb1 cells within a macrophage at 18 hr by the num-
ber at 0 hr.
Immunofluorescence
J774 cells were cultured to confluency as discussed above and seeded onto sterile 13 mm glass
coverslips at a density of 105 cells per ml without activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.
H99-GFP and Δplb1-GFP were opsonised with 18B7 for one hour. 18B7 was then removed by
centrifugation and fungal cells were suspended in 1 ml of PBS with 1:200 FITC for one hour.
Supernatant was removed again, cells were resuspended in PBS, and J774 were infected with
106 of either H99-GFP or Δplb1-GFP in serum free DMEM. After two hours of infection
media was removed from J774 cells and the cells were washed three times with PBS. 10 μm
TLT or DMSO was added to uninfected cells to act as controls. Cells were then left for 18
hours at 37 oC 5% CO2.
After 18 hours supernatants were removed and J774s were fixed with cold methanol for 5
minutes at -20 oC before washing with PBS three times, leaving PBS for five minutes at room
temperature between washes. Coverslips were blocked with 5% sheep serum in 0.1% triton
(block solution) for 20 minutes before being transferred into the primary PPAR-γ antibody
(1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7273 lot #B1417) with 1:10 human IgG in block solution
for one hour. Coverslips were washed 3 times in PBS and incubated with 1:200 anti-mouse
TRITC, 1:40 anti-human IgG, and 0.41 μl/ml DAPI in block solution for one hour. Coverslips
were then washed three times with PBS, three times with water, and fixed to slides using
MOWIOL. Slides were left in the dark overnight and imaged the following day. Imaging was

 performed on a Nikon Eclispe Ti microscope with a x60 DIC objective. Cells were imaged
with filter sets for Cy3 (PPAR-γ, 500ms exposure) GFP (Cryptococcus, 35 ms exposure) and
DAPI (Nuclei, 5ms) dyes in addition to DIC.
The intensity of nuclear staining was analysed for at least 30 cells per coverslip, using Ima-
geJ 2.0.0 a line ROI was drawn from the outside of cell, through the nucleus measuring the
mean grey value along the line. For Cryptococcus infected conditions uninfected and infected
cells were measured separately upon the same coverslip using the GFP channel to distinguish
between infected and uninfected cells.
J774 aspirin timelapse
Macrophages were seeded at 105 per ml into 24 well plates as described above. After two hours
cells requiring aspirin were treated with 1 mM aspirin in DMSO in fresh DMEM. Cells were
then incubated overnight for 18 hours at 37 oC 5% CO2. H99-GFP and Δplb1-GFP were pre-
pared at 106 cells per ml as described above, and opsonised with 18B7 for one hour. J774s were
then infected with the fungal cells in fresh serum free DMEM for two hours before removing
the supernatant, washing three times in PBS, and adding fresh serum free DMEM. Cells were
imaged for 18 hours on a Nikon Eclispe Ti equipped with a climate controlled stage (Tempera-
ture—37 oC, Atmosphere—5% CO2 / 95% air) with a x20 Lambda Apo NA 0.75 phase contrast
objective brightfield images were taken at an interval of 2 minutes, 50 ms exposure. Analysis
was performed by manual counts of intracellular and extracellular cryptococci.
Zebrafish infection
Washed and counted Cryptococcus cells from overnight culture were pelleted at 3300g for 1
minute and re-suspended in 10% Polyvinylpyrrolidinone (PVP), 0.5% Phenol Red in PBS to
give the required inoculum in 1 nl. This injection fluid was loaded into glass capillaries shaped
with a needle puller for microinjection. Zebrafish larvae were injected at 2-days post fertilisa-
tion; the embryos were anesthetised by immersion in 0.168 mg/ml tricaine in E3 before being
transferred onto microscope slides coated with 3% methyl cellulose in E3 for injection. Pre-
pared larvae were injected with two 0.5 nl boluses of injection fluid by compressed air into the
yolk sac circulation valley. Following injection, larvae were removed from the glass slide and
transferred to E3 to recover from anaesthetic and then transferred to fresh E3 to remove resid-
ual methyl cellulose. Successfully infected larvae (displaying systemic infection throughout the
body and no visible signs of damage resulting from injection) were sorted using a fluorescent
stereomicroscope. Infected larvae were maintained at 28 oC.
Eicosanoid / Receptor agonist treatment of infected zebrafish larvae
All compounds were purchased from Cayman Chemical. Compounds were resuspended in
DMSO and stored at -20 oC until used. Prostaglandin E2 (CAY14010, 10 mg/ml stock), Prosta-
glandin D2 (CAY12010, 10 mg/ml stock), 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 (CAY14750, 10 mg/ml stock),
15-keto-PGE2 (CAY14720, 10 mg/ml stock), troglitazone (CAY14720, 10 mg/ml stock),
GW9662 (CAY70785,1 mg/ml stock), AH6809 (CAY14050, 1 mg/ml stock), GW627368X
(CAY10009162, 10 mg/ml stock), NS-398 (CAY70590, 9.4 mg/ml stock), SC-560 (CAY70340,
5.3 mg/ml stock).
Treatment with exogenous compounds during larval infected was performed by adding
compounds (or equivalent solvent) to fish water (E3) to achieve the desired concentration.
Fish were immersed in compound supplemented E3 throughout the experiment from the time
of injection.

 Zebrafish fungal burden measurement
Individual infected zebrafish embryos were placed into single wells of a 96 well plate (VWR)
with 200 ul or E3 (unsupplemented E3, or E3 supplemented with eicosanoids / drugs depend-
ing on the assay). Infected embryos were imaged at 0-days post infection (dpi), 1 dpi, 2 dpi
and 3 dpi in their 96 well plates using a Nikon Ti-E with a CFI Plan Achromat UW 2X N.A
0.06 objective lens. Images were captured with a Neo sCMOS (Andor, Belfast, UK) and NIS
Elements (Nikon, Richmond, UK). Images were exported from NIS Elements into Image J FIJI
as monochrome tif files. Images were threshholded in FIJI using the ‘moments’ threshold pre-
set and converted to binary images to remove all pixels in the image that did not correspond to
the intensity of the fluorescently tagged C. neoformans. The outline of the embryo was traced
using the ‘polygon’ ROI tool, avoiding autofluorescence from the yolk sac. The total number
of pixels in the threshholded image were counted using the FIJI ‘analyse particles’ function, the
‘total area’ measurement from the ‘summary’ readout was used for the total number of GFP+
pixels in each embryo.
PPAR- γ GFP reporter fish treatment
PPARγ embryos [35, 36] were collected from homozygous ligand trap fish (F18). Embryos
were raised in a temperature-controlled water system under LD cycle at 28.5˚C. in 0.5× E2
media in petri-dishes till 1 dpf. Any developmentally delayed (dead or unfertilized) embryos
were removed. Chorions were removed enzymatically with Pronase (1 mg/ml) and specimens
were dispensed into 24 well plates (10 per well) in 0.5 ×E2 media. For embryos 1% DMSO was
used as a vehicle control. Chemicals were stored in DMSO, diluted appropriately and added
individually to 400 ul of 0.5×E2 media with 0.05 U/ml penicillin and 50 ng/ml streptomycin
and vortexed intensively for 1 min. 0.5×E2 media was removed from all wells with embryos
and the 400 ul chemical solutions were administered to different wells to embryos. For drug
treatment embryos were pre-incubated for 1 hour with compounds and then heat induced
(28!37˚ C.) for 30 min in a water bath. Embryos were incubated at 28˚C for 18 h and then
monitored using a fluorescent dissection scope (SteREO Lumar.V12 Carl Zeiss) at 2 dpf. For
analyzing GFP fluorescent pattern, embryos were anesthetized with Tricaine (Sigma, Cat.# A-
5040) and mounted in 2% methyl cellulose.
Whole body macrophage counts
2 dpf transgenic zebrafish larvae which have fluorescently tagged macrophages due to an
mCherry fluorescent protein driven by the macrophage specific gene marker mpeg1 [56] Tg
(mpeg1:mCherryCAAX)sh378) [22] were treated with 10 μM PGE2, 10 μM 15-keto-PGE2 or an
equivalent DMSO control for 2 days. Larvae were then anesthetized by immersion in 0.168
mg/ml tricaine in E3 and imaged using a Nikon Ti-E with a Nikon Plan APO 20x/ 0.75 DIC
N2 objective lens, taking z stacks of the entire body with 15 μM z steps. Macrophage counts
were made manually using ImageJ from maximum projections.
Eicosanoid measurement (ELISA)
J774 macrophages were seeded into 24 well plates at a concentration of 1x105 per well and
incubated for 24 hours at 37 oC 5% CO2. J774 cells were infected with C. neoformans as
described above, at the same MOI 1:10 and incubated for 18 hours with 1ml serum free
DMEM. At 18 hours post infection the supernatant was removed for ELISA analysis.
For ELISA analysis with aspirin treatment, wells requiring aspirin had supernatants
removed and replaced with fresh DMEM containing 1 mM aspirin in 1% DMSO. Cells were

 left for 24 hours total. At 24 hours all wells received fresh serum free media. Wells requiring
aspirin for the duration received 1 mM aspirin in DMSO. Aspirin treated cells requiring ara-
chidonic acid were treated with 30 μg per ml arachidonic acid in ethanol. Control wells
received the following: either 1% DMSO, 30 μg per ml arachidonic acid, or ethanol. Cells were
again left at 37 oC 5% CO2 for 18 hours.
Supernatants were then removed and frozen at -80 oC until use. Supernatants were analysed
as per the PGE2 EIA ELISA kit instructions (Cayman Chemical).
Eicosanoid measurement (mass spectrometry)
J774 macrophages were seeded into T25 tissue culture flasks at a concentration of 1.3x106 cells
per flask and incubated for 24 hours at 37 oC 5% CO2. J774 cells were infected with C. neofor-
mans as described above, at the same MOI 1:10 and incubated for 18 hours with 2 ml serum
free DMEM. At 18 hours post infection infected cells were scraped from the flask with a cell
scraper into the existing supernatant and immediately snap frozen in ethanol / dry ice slurry.
All samples were stored at -80 oC before analysis.
Lipids and lipid standards were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, Michigan).
Deuterated standard Prostaglandin E2-d4 (PGE2-d4), �98% deuterated form. HPLC grade sol-
vents were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire UK).
Lipids were extracted by adding a solvent mixture (1 mol/L acetic acid, isopropyl alcohol,
hexane (2:20:30, v/v/v)) to the sample at a ratio of 2.5–1 ml sample, vortexing, and then adding
2.5 ml of hexane [57]. Where quantitation was required, 2 ng PGE2-d4, was added to samples
before extraction, as internal standard. After vortexing and centrifugation, lipids were recov-
ered in the upper hexane layer. The samples were then re-extracted by addition of an equal vol-
ume of hexane. The combined hexane layers were dried and analyzed for Prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) using LC-MS/MS as below.
Lipid extracts were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using a ZORBAX RRHD Eclipse Plus
95Å C18, 2.1 x 150 mm, 1.8 μm column (Agilent Technologies, Cheshire, UK), kept in a col-
umn oven maintained at 45˚C. Lipids were eluted with a mobile phase consisting of A, water-
B-acetic acid of 95:5:0.01 (vol/vol/vol), and B, acetonitrile-methanol-acetic acid of 80:15:0.01
(vol/vol/vol), in a gradient starting at 30% B. After 1 min that was ramped to 35% over 3 min,
67.5% over 8.5 min and to 100% over 5 min. This was subsequently maintained at 100% B for
3.5 min and then at 30% B for 1.5 min, with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Products were moni-
tored by LC/MS/MS in negative ion mode, on a 6500 Q-Trap (Sciex, Cheshire, United King-
dom) using parent-to-daughter transitions of m/z 351.2 ! 271.2 (PGE2), and m/z 355.2 !
275.2 for PGE2-d4. ESI-MS/MS conditions were: TEM 475˚C, GS1 60, GS2 60, CUR 35, IS
-4500 V, dwell time 75 s, DP -60 V, EP -10 V, CE -25 V and CXP at -10 V. PGE2 was quantified
using standard curves generated by varying PGE2 with a fixed amount of PGE2-d4.

 S4 Fig. Genotyping to confirm zebrafish ptges CRISPR. Zebrafish were genotyped post
assay (5 dpf), an area of genomic DNA spanning the ptges gene ATG site (the CRISPR tar-
get) was amplified with PCR to produce a 345 bp product. This product was digested with
Mwol to produce genotype specific banding patterns A. Schematic of the banding patterns
expected for each genotype following Mwol digestion– 1. Undigested product, a single 345 bp
band 2. Wild type genotype, 184, 109 and 52 bp bands 3. Hetrozygous genotype (ptges +/-) 293,
184, 109 and 52 bp bands 4. Homozygous genotype (ptges -/-) strong bands for 293 and 52 bp,
weaker bands at 184 and 109 bp can sometimes be seen indicating a small amount of wildtype
ptges is still present (this is thought to be beneficial as low levels of ptges are required for larvae
survival. B Genotyping for H99 infected larvae, L = DNA ladder (NEB 50 bp ladder), wt =
undigested wild type control, wt dig = wild type digested control, numbers correspond to indi-
vidual larvae genotyped. H99 + tyro = tyr -/- larvae infected with H99-GFP. H99 + ptges =
ptges -/- larvae infected with H99-GFP C Genotyping for Δplb1 infected larvae, L = DNA ladder
(NEB 50 bp ladder), wt = undigested wild type control, wt dig = wild type digested control,
numbers correspond to individual larvae genotyped. Δplb1+ tyro = tyr -/- larvae infected with
Δplb1-GFP. Δplb1+ ptges = ptges -/- larvae infected with Δplb1-GFP.
