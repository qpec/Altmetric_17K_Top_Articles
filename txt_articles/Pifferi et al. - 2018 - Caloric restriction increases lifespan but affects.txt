The health benefits of chronic caloric restriction resulting in lifespan extension are well
established in many short-lived species, but the effects in humans and other primates remain
controversial. Here we report the most advanced survival data and the associated follow-up
to our knowledge of age-related alterations in a cohort of grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus
murinus, lemurid primate) exposed to a chronic moderate (30%) caloric restriction. Com-
pared to control animals, caloric restriction extended lifespan by 50% (from 6.4 to 9.6 years,
median survival), reduced aging-associated diseases and preserved loss of brain white matter
in several brain regions. However, caloric restriction accelerated loss of grey matter
throughout much of the cerebrum. Cognitive and behavioural performances were, however,
not modulated by caloric restriction. Thus chronic moderate caloric restriction can extend
lifespan and enhance health of a primate, but it affects brain grey matter integrity without
affecting cognitive performances.

aloric restriction, i.e., reducing calorie availability by
~20–50%, is one of the rare known strategies that can
extend lifespan. In short-lived species such as rodents,
caloric restriction can increase maximal lifespan up to 50%1 while
improving general health and decreasing aging-associated dis-
eases2. Beneficial effects of caloric restriction on age-related dis-
eases have also been reported for long-lived species, including
rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) at the Wisconsin National
Primate Research Center3,4 and at the National Institute on
Aging5. Increased survival was, however, only reported in the
Wisconsin National Primate Research Center study3,4,6. Here we
examine the effects of caloric restriction on the health and life-
span of the grey mouse lemur Microcebus murinus, a small
lemurid primate from Madagascar with a median survival in
captivity of 5.7 years for males and maximum lifespan of 12
years7. Mouse lemurs are widely used models for human ageing.
They display age-related alterations of their sensorial system,
motor functions, biological rhythms and immune and endocrine
systems7. In this species, aging leads to increased prevalence of
diseases such as neoplasia or sarcopenia8 and glucoregulatory
function alterations9 that also increase with aging in humans.
Finally, their cerebral aging profile is similar to that of humans as
they display age-related cognitive alterations associated with
cerebral atrophy10 as well as Alzheimer’s disease-like amyloid
lesions11. Like humans and other non-human primates, they are
genetically heterogeneous providing a natural diversity of aging
profiles. Because of their reduced lifespan (as compared to
macaque), cohorts of calorie-restricted animals can be easily
created to evaluate mechanisms leading to caloric restriction-
related changes. Here we provide the first complete set of caloric
restriction-related survival data for a non-human primate in
association with a longitudinal follow-up of age-associated
alterations in cognition and brain volumes.
In 2006, 34 captive adult male mouse lemurs (age 3.2 ± 0.1
years) were randomly assigned to either a control diet consisting
of 15 g of mixture and 6 g of fresh fruit per day, equivalent to 105
kJ/day on average (control, n = 15) or a chronic 30% caloric
restriction diet (71 kJ/day on average, n = 19)12. Their longevity,
age-related pathologies, cognitive abilities, motor skills and cer-
ebral atrophy were then followed until their natural death. Here
we report that caloric restriction extended lifespan by 50% in
male mouse lemurs and decelerated brain white matter atrophy
but accelerated the loss of grey matter throughout most of the
cerebrum.
Results
Caloric restriction ameliorates health and extends lifespan. As
expected, calorie-restricted animals consistently exhibited lower
body mass than the control animals, and the difference stabilised
to ~28% after 4 years of treatment (70.9 ± 2.1 g versus 97.6 ± 6.8 g
after 4 years of caloric restriction or control diet, respectively;
linear mixed effect (LME): F = −6.1, p = 7.10e-7, Fig. 1a).

 Caloric restriction had a strong positive effect on mouse lemur
lifespan. At the cut-off date of the present study, none of the 15
animals on the control diet had survived, whereas 7 of the 19
(37%)
calorie-restricted
animals
were
still
alive
(Log-rank
Mantel–Cox test: Chi-square = 4.9, p = 0.03; Fig. 1b). Median
survival times were 6.4 and 9.6 years for control and calorie-
restricted animals, respectively, which corresponds to a 50%
increase in median lifespan. Also, 7 calorie-restricted animals
reached 13 years of age, which is far beyond the maximal lifespan
of 12 years reported in our breeding colony7 and of 11 years
reported in the control animals. The increased lifespan of calorie-
restricted individuals was accompanied by a lower incidence of
age-related pathologies such as cancer and chronic nephritis
(Fig. 1c) as 33.3% of deaths (4 of 12) were attributable to these
diseases in the caloric restriction group compared to 73.3% of
deaths (11 of the 15 deaths) in control animals (Log-rank
Mantel–Cox test: Chi-square = 4.9, p = 0.03; Supplementary
Table 1). Also, the mortality rate associated with age-related
diseases was 60% lower under caloric restriction (0.44 deaths/
year) compared to control animals (1.1 deaths/year; Log-rank
Mantel–Cox test: Chi-square = 7.9, p = 0.005; Fig. 1d). However,
caloric restriction did not decrease age-associated ocular diseases
that involved 50 and 40% of control and calorie-restricted
animals over 9 years of age, respectively, and 100% of the animals
after 10 years (Supplementary Table 2).
Caloric restriction did not alter motor and cognitive capacities.
Although caloric restriction has been reported to protect against
many aspects of brain aging in mammals13, deleterious effects of
caloric restriction on cognitive performance have been reported
for
rats14
and
for
cerebral
and
emotional
functions
in
humans15,16. Here cognitive performances were assessed by
testing spatial and working memories using the Barnes maze task
and the spontaneous alternation task. Age did not affect perfor-
mance on the Barnes maze task (LME: F = 0.04, p = 0.57) while
scores in the spontaneous alternation task were decreased over
years (LME: F = 5.39, p = 0.03). However, performances in the
Barnes maze task were not different between control and calorie-
restricted animals (LME: F = 0.05, p = 0.82; Fig. 2a). Similarly,
the spontaneous alternation task did not reveal any difference
between control and calorie-restricted animals (LME: F = 1.63,
p = 0.22; Fig. 2b). In several transversal studies, we reported age-
related cognitive changes detected with the tasks used in the
current study10. One possible explanation for the lack of aging
effects detected here is the occurrence of practice effect that
prevented detection of aging effects17. Motor performances,
which are important for physical independence and healthy aging
in humans18, were assessed in the accelerating rotarod task and
control and calorie-restricted animals exhibited similar motor
abilities (LME: F = 0.36, p = 0.54; Fig. 2c), with no effect of age in
both groups (LME: F = 0.004, p = 0.95).
Caloric restriction accelerates grey matter atrophy. In humans
and non-human primates, including mouse lemurs, aging induces
a cerebral atrophy that is associated with cognitive impair-
ments10,19,20. However, this atrophy was rescued by caloric
restriction in some brain regions in rhesus monkeys for both
white17 and grey matter3. Serial magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) of mouse lemur brains was performed once a year for 4
years, beginning at age 7.0 ± 0.2 years. Voxel-based morpho-
metric analysis of the initial MR images, i.e., after 4 years of
treatment, revealed small regions with lower grey matter volumes
in calorie-restricted animals as compared to control. The atro-

mouse lemurs either on a chronic 30% calorie-restricted (red) diet or on a control (blue) diet. Values shown are mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM);
numbers indicate the number of animals in the calorie-restricted and control groups. a Barnes maze score was calculated using the following formula:
Score = (10−number of errors), higher scores thus reflect better spatial memory. No significant difference in Barnes maze score was observed between
control and calorie-restricted animals (p = 0.82). b The alternation score was obtained by calculating the ratio of actual alternation to possible alternation
and was expressed as percentage (%), higher scores reflecting better working memory. No significant difference was observed between control and

 entorhinal cortex (Fig. 3a–c, Supplementary Table 3). Over the
subsequent 4 years, caloric restriction significantly increased the
aging-associated atrophy in several other brain regions, including
the hippocampus and the retrosplenial cortex (time of treatment
by diet group interaction, Fig. 3d–f, Supplementary Table 4). This
indicated a stronger reduction of grey matter volume with age in
the caloric restriction group as compared to control animals,
which is contradictory to a previous report in rhesus maca-
ques3,21. Also, evaluation within each group (Fig. 4, Supple-
mentary Tables 5 and 6) revealed that age-related grey matter
atrophy occurred in widespread brain regions in calorie-restricted
animals, including hippocampus (Fig. 4c–e), while only few
regions, such as the septum and amygdala, were atrophied in
control animals (Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).
We did not detect any difference in white matter volume
between control and calorie-restricted animals at initial imaging
time. However, the slopes of age-related white matter atrophy
(time of treatment by diet group interaction) over the subsequent
4 years showed a lower rate of atrophy in the genu and splenium
of the corpus callosum as well as in the fimbria hippocampi of the
calorie-restricted compared to control animals (Supplementary
Fig. 1). These results corroborate previous studies in rhesus
monkeys21 and mice22 reporting a beneficial effect of caloric
restriction in preserving white matter. Evaluation of the effects of
aging in each group revealed widespread loss of white matter in
most parts of the corpus callosum, the internal and external
capsule and the fimbria hippocampi of control animals (Fig. 5a, c,
d, Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). There was similar white matter
atrophy in most of these regions in the calorie-restricted animals
(Fig. 5b, c, Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). However, the genu of
the corpus callosum was spared in calorie-restricted animals
(Fig. 5b, d, Supplementary Tables 7 and 8).
Discussion
The present results provide evidence that chronic, moderate
(30%) caloric restriction, when started early in adult life, can
extend the lifespan of mouse lemurs by 50% and reduce the risk
of age-associated diseases including cancer and chronic nephritis
and age-associated mortality. Although this study was conducted
in males only, which might moderate the translatability of these
results, they support the hypothesis that caloric restriction has
important beneficial effects on healthspan and lifespan in pri-
mates, as it does in many animals with a shorter lifespan. The
effect of age on cognitive performances was only moderate and
seemed to alter short-term working memory but not long-term
spatial memory, which could be related to practice effects asso-
ciated with the annual testing of the animals17 and to the diffi-
culty in reliable performance of cognitive tasks in very old
individuals (e.g., deterioration of motor capacities, ocular defects).
Caloric restriction accelerated atrophy of grey matter in old
mouse lemurs but preserved old animals from white matter
atrophy compared to old controls. None of these effects of caloric
restriction on brain atrophy were associated with changes in
cognitive performances. Overall, this study not only sheds light
on a potential negative impact of caloric restriction on brain
integrity that deserves more investigation but also shows a strong
positive effect of caloric restriction on enhanced physiological
health ultimately leading to increased healthspan and lifespan.
Methods
Animals and breeding. All M. murinus mouse lemurs studied were males born in
the laboratory breeding colony of the CNRS/MNHN in Brunoy, France (UMR
7179 CNRS/MNHN; European Institutions Agreement # E 91–114.1). Briefly, 34
male grey mouse lemurs were included in the study beginning at 3.2 ± 0.1 years of
age, considered an adult age in this species in captivity. Animals were housed
individually in cages (50 × 60 × 70 cm3) provided with wooden branches and

 wooden nests, in standard and constant conditions of temperature (24–26 °C),
relative humidity (55%) and artificial lighting (white light, 250 lux, wavelength peak
at 488 nm). Animals were fed fresh fruit and a daily mixture made up of ginger
bread, cereals, milk and eggs. This diet is composed of 61% carbohydrates, 23%
proteins and 16% lipids12. Water was given ad libitum. Health status of the animals
was regularly checked and included weekly body weight measurement, monthly
veterinarian examination and yearly ocular examination by a veterinary ophthal-
mologist. All described procedures were approved by the Animal Welfare board of
the UMR 7179 and complied with the European ethic regulation for the use of
animals in biomedical research.
Dietary intervention. The design of the Restrikal study has been previously
described12. At the beginning of the study, animals weighed 90 ± 5 g. They were
then divided into two dietary groups that were matched for body weight, age and
pedigree: a control group consisting of 15 animals fed the standard diet described
above, and a group of 19 animals submitted to calorie restriction that were fed the
same diet but received 30% less than the control. The daily amount of food given to
the animals (15 g of mixture and 6 g of fresh fruit per day, equivalent to 105 kJ/day
on average for the control group; 30% less for calorie-restricted animals) was
estimated from preliminary internal studies at the Brunoy facility over a year of
measuring spontaneous food intake in isolated control adult animals (unpublished
data). According to the spontaneous variations of food intake in all animals12, the
actual percentage of caloric restriction was around 24% during this study.
Circular platform task (Barnes-like maze) for cognitive skill evaluation. The
apparatus consisted of a white circular rotating platform (diameter, 100 cm) placed
at 60 cm above the floor. The platform contained 12 equally spaced circular holes
(each 5 cm in diameter) at 3 cm from the perimeter. A cardboard nest-box (10 ×
10 × 20 cm3) was inserted beneath one hole and served as a refuge (goal box). A
small black plywood box was placed beneath the other (non-goal) holes to prevent
lemurs from jumping through these holes while permitting head entry. The plat-
form was surrounded by a 25 cm high white wall and covered with a transparent
Plexiglas cap, allowing the mouse lemurs to see cues outside the maze. The
apparatus was surrounded by a black curtain hung from a square metallic frame, in
the centre of which there was a one-way mirror that allowed observation. Twenty-
four evenly spaced 2-Watts lights were affixed around the perimeter of the maze 50
cm above the platform to illuminate the maze. The centre of the maze was also
illuminated by a 60-Watts light. Between the one-way mirror and the upper edge of
the wall, various objects were attached along the inner surface of the curtain to
serve as visual cues. The starting box was an open-ended dark cylinder positioned
in the centre of the platform. Transparent radial Plexiglas partitions were placed
between the holes to prevent the strategy used by some mouse lemurs to go directly
to the periphery of the platform, then walk along the barrier wall and inspect each
hole one by one. Consequently, animals had to return to the centre of the platform
after each hole inspection.
Animals were given 1 day of training (day 1) and 1 day of testing (day 2). Each
day comprised of four trials, each of which began with placement of the animal
inside the starting box. After 30 s, the box was lifted to release the animal. For the
animals, the objective was to reach the goal box positioned beneath one of the 12
holes. When it entered the goal box, the trial was stopped, and it was allowed to
remain in its own nest for 1 min. After each trial, the platform was randomly
rotated on its central axis to avoid the use of intra-maze cues, although the position
of the goal box in the room was kept constant.

matter values, with the values of the 6–7-year-old animals centred at 0. Dots from individual animals are connected with curves. As the data were adjusted
to the general linear model after removal of confounding effects (i.e., repetition of the measures), curves from control or caloric restriction groups appear
parallel. Indeed, the model estimates that the slope of the grey matter evolution is similar in control or calorie-restricted animals. It is the term ϵk

 On day 1, trials 1 and 2 consisted of placing the animal in the maze centre while
only one corridor, containing only the opened goal hole, was accessible (one-choice
test). For trials 3 and 4, the platform comprised six reachable corridors among
which only one hole was opened (six-choice test). These two trials permitted the
animal to explore the maze, observe the visual cues and further learn the position
of the goal box.
On day 2, all 12 corridors were accessible, with only one hole open during the
four trials. Performance was assessed by the time required for the animal to reach
the right exit and by the number of errors prior to reaching the goal box. An error
was defined as an inspection of an incorrect hole. Only data from animals that
reached the goal box before 20 min of testing were included in the behavioural
analyses. This inclusion criterion and the increasing prevalence of ocular
pathologies with age (Supplementary Table 2) account for the difference between
the total number of animals in the study and the number of animals presented in
Fig. 2a.
The parameter measured to evaluate spatial memory is the number of errors
before finding the correct exit on day 2. Results are expressed as a score, calculated
using the following formula: Score = (10−number of errors). A negative number
gives a score of 0. Higher scores thus reflect better spatial memory.
Spatial memory was assessed from Year 1 of treatment until natural death.
Continuous spontaneous alternation task for cognitive skill evaluation. The
test was performed in a plus-maze constructed of wood (each arm: 25 cm high × 40
cm long × 15 cm wide). The four arms (labelled A, B, C and D) ended with 90° left
turns (10 cm long) so that the ends of the arms were not visible from the centre of
the maze to stimulate mouse lemur exploratory behaviour. In order to prevent
jumps over the walls of the maze, a one-way mirror was placed on the top of the
maze. This ceiling allowed experimental observation but prevented mouse lemurs
from seeing extra-maze cues. Different intra-maze cues such as pieces of plastic,
foam rubber or cardboard were placed on the walls of each arm in order to
distinguish them. A red 15-Watts bulb was placed on the top of the longer wall of
each arm and provided the only light in the room during testing. At the beginning
of the trial, the animal was placed in the centre of the maze with all four arms
closed by opaque doors. After 30 s, the doors were slowly raised and the mouse
lemur was allowed to explore the four arms freely for 20 min. The number and the
sequence of entries (all four paws into a given arm) were recorded. Alternation was
defined as entry into three different arms on the same overlapping sets of four
consecutive choices. For example, a set consisting of arm choices B, D, C, B, was
considered as an alternation. The possible alternation sequences are equal to the
number of arms entries minus three. The alternation score was obtained by cal-
culating the ratio of actual alternation to possible alternation and was expressed as
percentage (%). Only data from animals that made at least six arm entries were
included in the behavioural analyses. This inclusion criterion and the increasing
prevalence of ocular pathologies with age (Supplementary Table 2) account for the
difference between the total number of animals in the study and the number of
animals presented in Fig. 2b.
As for spatial memory, working memory was assessed from Year 1 until natural
death.

 Accelerating rotarod task for motor performance evaluation. For each trial, an
animal was placed on a rotarod (model 7750, Ugo Basile, Italy), a motor-driven
treadmill with a 5-cm-diameter cylinder. The speed of rotation was increased from
17 to 40 rpm until the animal could no longer perform the running response
without falling or gripping the rod on at least three consecutive turns, and the time
spent on the cylinder was used as a measure of motor performance. Animals
underwent five consecutive trials, and the best result was retained. Only data from
animals that stayed on the rotarod >1 s during at least 1 trial were included in the
analyses. This inclusion criterion and the increasing prevalence of ocular pathol-
ogies with age (Supplementary Table 2) account for the difference between the total
number of animals in the study and the number of animals presented in Fig. 2c.
Motor performances were assessed from Year 1 of treatment until natural death.
MRI acquisition and analysis. All the animals involved in the current study were
studied by MRI from the age of 7.0 ± 0.2 years (n = 20 animals, 7 control, 13
calorie-restricted (7.6 ± 0.4 versus 6.8 ± 0.2 years at inclusion, respectively,
Mann–Whitney U = 23.5, N.S.) and once a year for 4 years unless they died before.
The average age of the animals at the different imaging time points was not
significantly different in the two groups (8.1 ± 0.3 versus 7.8 ± 0.2 years, U = 218,
N.S). Brain images were recorded on a 7.0 Tesla spectrometer (Varian) using a
four-channel phase surface coil (RapidBiomedical, Rimpar, Germany) actively
decoupled from the transmitting birdcage probe (RapidBiomedical, Rimpar, Ger-
many). Briefly, animals were anaesthetised by isoflurane (4% for induction and
1–1.5% for maintenance). Respiratory rate was monitored to insure animal stability
until the end of the experiment. Body temperature was maintained by an air-
heating system. Two-dimensional fast spin-echo images were recorded with an
isotropic nominal resolution of 230 µm (128 slices, TR/TE = 10000/17.4 ms; rare
factor = 4; acquisition time = 32 min). MRIs were zero-filled to reach an apparent
isotropic resolution of 115 µm.
Fifty-one images were analysed using voxel-based morphometry by applying
SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Institute of Neurology, University College London, UK,
http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) with the SPMMouse toolbox (http://spmmouse.
org) for animal brain morphometry26. The brain images were segmented into grey
and white matter tissue probability maps using locally developed priors26, then
spatially transformed to the standard space defined by Sawiak et al. using a grey
matter mouse-lemur template26. Affine regularisation was set for an average-sized
template, with a bias non-uniformity cut-off full-width half-maximum of 10 mm, a
5 mm basis-function cut-off and a sampling distance of 0.3 mm. The resulting grey
matter and white matter portions were output in rigid template space, and
DARTEL27 was used to create non-linearly registered maps for each subject and
common templates for the cohort of animals. The warped grey matter portions for
each subject were modulated with the Jacobian determinant from the DARTEL
registration fields to preserve tissue amounts (‘optimised voxel-based
morphometric analysis’28) and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 600 µm to
produce maps for analysis.
A general linear model was evaluated with a design based on multiple
regressions with the diet group effect and time of treatment of the animals of each
group (control, caloric restriction) as variables of interest. This type of regression
technique produces t-statistic and colour-coded maps that are the product of a
regression model performed at every voxel in the brain. Contiguous groups of
voxels that attain statistical significance, called clusters, are displayed on brain
images.
With the general linear model, the brain of one animal is defined by the number
“j”, and the location of a pixel is defined as “k”. The signal (i.e., the probability for
the signal to be grey matter or white matter) within a pixel (Yk
j ) can be explained
by the following equation
Yk
j ¼ βk
1 þ xj;1βk
2 þ xj;2βk
3 þ T1
j βk
4 þ ¼ þ T20
j βk
23 þ TIVjβk

with βk
1 = mean image; βk
2 = evolution of the signal according to time of treatment
for control animals (i.e., slope of signal evolution for n = 13 images); βk
3 =
evolution of signal according to time of treatment for calorie-restricted animals
(i.e., slope of signal evolution for n = 38 images); βk
4 = longitudinal follow-up for
control animal #1; …; βk
10 = longitudinal follow-up for control animal #7; βk
11 =
longitudinal follow-up for calorie-restricted animal #1; …; βk
23 = longitudinal
follow-up for calorie-restricted animal #13; and βk
24 = effect of total intracranial
volume (TIV) on the signal for each animal. In the matrix for analysis, the Tx
j is 1
or 0 if the animal #x is analysed or not. TIV corresponds to the TIV value for each
animal. It was similar for the different images from the same animal followed-up
longitudinally.
The time of treatment effect within each group is defined by xj;1βk
2 and by xj;2βk
3
for the control and calorie-restricted animals, respectively. xj,1 and xj,2 represent the
age of the animals in the control and caloric restriction groups, respectively. In
other words, xj,1 = age of the animal if the jth animal is a control animal, 0
otherwise and xj,2 = age of the animal if the jth animal is a calorie-restricted animal,
0 otherwise. The term ϵk
j corresponds to the 'error' of the measure for each animal.
A contrast defines a linear combination of the β as cTβ. For example, the time of
treatment-related reduction of grey matter in the control animals would be defined
using a contrast cTβ = [0 −1 0…]T. The Null hypothesis is H0 : cTβ ¼ 0, while the
alternative hypotheses is H1 : cTβ>0. This hypothesis is tested with:

This analysis allows to remove confounding effects such as repetition of the
measures during longitudinal evaluation of the same animal or TIV from the raw
data Yk
j . Voxels with a modulated grey matter value <0.2 were not considered for
analysis. In other words, volumetric scans were entered as the dependent variable.
Time of treatment of the animals and groups (control or caloric restriction) were
the independent variables. Longitudinal follow-up effect and TIV were covariates.
One-tailed t-tests contrasts were set up to find areas where grey matter and
white matter values were different in control and calorie-restricted animals at the
beginning of the MRI study. Then other one-tailed t-tests were used to compare the
slopes (i.e., βk
2 for control and βk
3 for calorie-restricted animals) of the evolution of
grey matter and white matter values with aging in control and calorie-restricted
animals during the 4 years of the MRI study (time of treatment×diet group
interaction effect). Time of treatment effects were also evaluated in animals from
the two groups. In this case, the model estimates whether the slope of the grey
matter or white matter evolution within the two group (i.e., βk
2 for control or βk
3 =
calorie-restricted animals) were different from zero. It is the term ϵk
j corresponding
to the error of the measure for each animal that is adjusted to fit the model.
The threshold to consider a voxel as different between two groups was set at
p < 0.005 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons) as in Colman et al. (2009)3.
Clusters required 75 contiguous voxels to be selected as relevant. Clusters fulfilling
these conditions were displayed on brain sections or three-dimensional views of the
brain. Adjusted grey or white matter values were also presented to display time of
treatment effect in control or calorie-restricted animals on which statistical analysis
were performed. For each animal, they correspond to
Yk

βk
4 to 24 and TIVj were constant for a given animal studied in a longitudinal way.
Also seen in the equation, βk
2 and βk
3, i.e., the slopes of evolution of adjusted grey or
white matter values with time were similar for the different animals from a single
group (control or caloric restriction, respectively).
Mortality data. Animals were followed until their spontaneous death. Based on
specific criteria (rapid body mass loss, anaemia, difficulty breathing), euthanasia
was also performed when necessary to shorten animal suffering; moribund animals
were deeply anaesthetised with 100 mg/kg of pentobarbital, intraperitoneally. All
organs were harvested and kept for future analysis.
Pathophysiological analysis of post-mortem tissues. After the death of an
animal, a post-mortem analysis of tissues was performed whenever possible (n = 13
control, n=11 caloric restriction). Samples from liver, kidney, spleen, small
intestine, lungs, heart, stomach and pancreas were collected on each animal. Other
organs (bladder, brain or colon) were collected if a macroscopic lesion was
observed. All tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in
paraffin, sectioned at 4 µm and stained with haematoxylin, eosin and saffron.
Data analysis and statistics. Data are given as mean ± standard error of the mean
(SEM). The Shapiro–Wilk goodness-of-fit test was applied to determine whether
the sample data were likely to derive from a normally distributed population. Data
were analysed with LME models, built with the ‘lmer’ function from package lme4
v 1.1–13 in R 3.0.2 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). Normality of
models’ residuals was checked by plotting normal quantile–quantile and Q–Q line.
Explanatory variables were the fixed effects of treatment (control versus caloric
restriction) and of treatment duration (age effect) and their interaction. Inter-
individual variability as well as repetition of measurements over years were
included in the random effect. p-Values were calculated by performing an analysis
of variance on the model using package ‘lmerTest’ v 2.0–33.
The effects of treatments (i.e., control versus caloric restriction) on both overall
and age-related mortalities were investigated using Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox
proportional hazard (PH) regressions. Survival time was the time between onset of
treatment and any cause of death for overall mortality analyses or age-related death
for age-related mortality analyses. The cut-off date was set as December 1, 2016.
The PH assumption was tested by fitting a PH Cox regression with linear
treatment–time interactions; these interaction terms did not significantly differ
from zero for both analyses, and the proportional hazard assumptions were
therefore considered as valid. SAS V9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for
survival analyses. Type-1 error was set at 0.05 level.
