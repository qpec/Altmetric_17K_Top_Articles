 Abstract
 OBJECT—This report describes the stereotactic technique, hospitalization, and 90-day 
perioperative safety of bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the fornix in patients who 
underwent DBS for the treatment of mild, probable Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
 METHODS—The ADvance Trial is a multicenter, 12-month, double-blind, randomized, 
controlled feasibility study being conducted to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of 
DBS of the fornix in patients with mild, probable AD. Intra-operative and perioperative data were 
collected prospectively. All patients underwent postoperative MRI. Stereotactic analyses were 
performed in a blinded fashion by a single surgeon. Adverse events (AEs) were reported to an 
independent clinical events committee and adjudicated to determine the relationship between the 
AE and the study procedure.
 RESULTS—Between June 6, 2012, and April 28, 2014, a total of 42 patients with mild, 
probable AD were treated with bilateral fornix DBS (mean age 68.2 ± 7.8 years; range 48.0–79.7 
years; 23 men and 19 women). The mean planned target coordinates were x = 5.2 ± 1.0 mm (range 
3.0–7.9 mm), y = 9.6 ± 0.9 mm (range 8.0–11.6 mm), z = −7.5 ± 1.2 mm (range −5.4 to −10.0 
mm), and the mean postoperative stereotactic radial error on MRI was 1.5 ± 1.0 mm (range 0.2–
4.0 mm). The mean length of hospitalization was 1.4 ± 0.8 days. Twenty-six (61.9%) patients 
experienced 64 AEs related to the study procedure, of which 7 were serious AEs experienced by 5 
patients (11.9%). Four (9.5%) patients required return to surgery: 2 patients for explantation due to 
infection, 1 patient for lead repositioning, and 1 patient for chronic subdural hematoma. No 
patients experienced neurological deficits as a result of the study, and no deaths were reported.
 CONCLUSIONS—Accurate targeting of DBS to the fornix without direct injury to it is 
feasible across surgeons and treatment centers. At 90 days after surgery, bilateral fornix DBS was 
well tolerated by patients with mild, probable AD.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) poses a significant threat to public health, and current treatment 
options have limited efficacy. New AD treatments are urgently needed. To this end, deep 
brain stimulation (DBS) of the fornix (DBS-f) was previously evaluated in a small pilot 
study.12 In the United States, DBS is approved by the US FDA as a therapy for Parkinson’s 
disease (PD) and essential tremor. The use of DBS has also been studied as a treatment for 
other neurological disorders, such as primary dystonia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
epilepsy, Tourette’s syndrome, pain, treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, 
anorexia nervosa, addiction, traumatic brain injury, and obesity.
The ADvance Trial is a multicenter, 12-month, double-blind, randomized, controlled 
feasibility study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of DBS-f in 
patients with mild, probable AD. Patients are randomized to receive stimulation-on or 
stimulation-off in a double-blind manner for a period of 1 year. The primary end point of the 
ADvance Trial is to evaluate the safety of DBS-f, and the secondary end point evaluates the 
preliminary efficacy of therapy. This report describes the 90-day perioperative surgical

 experience of patients undergoing DBS-f, including surgical technique, stereotactic 
accuracy, hospital course, and adverse events (AEs) occurring within 90 days of surgery. 
This is the largest study reported to date on DBS performed for AD.
 METHODS
 Study Design and Objectives
The study design, methods, and informed consent were approved by the institutional review 
board overseeing each of the respective 7 participating sites. The study was registered with 
the clinicaltrials.gov database (registration no. NCT01608061).
All patients were enrolled and treated according to the ADvance study protocol. The 
inclusion criteria required that patients be between the ages of 45 and 85 years (inclusive) 
and have an Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog-11)16 
score between 12 and 24 (inclusive).
 Surgical Technique and Patient Monitoring
Patients underwent surgical implantation of DBS electrodes (model 3387; Medtronic, Inc.), 
which were inserted bilaterally through 2 bur holes, followed by the implantation of a dual-
channel internal pulse generator (IPG) into the infraclavicular area (Activa PC, Medtronic, 
Inc.). These were connected via a lead extension (model 37085, Medtronic, Inc.). After 
surgery, stereotactic MRI was performed, and patients were admitted to the hospital. Patients 
were seen by the treating neurosurgeon at 2 weeks and again 6 to 12 weeks after the 
operation. In a separate setting, 2 weeks after the operation, monopolar review was carried 
out, followed by activation versus no activation of the device in a randomized, double-blind 
fashion, per the study design. All treating physicians and patients were blinded to the 
activation status of the IPG. Close clinical follow-up was maintained, as per the study 
protocol, beyond the perioperative neurosurgical clinic visits.
 Stereotactic Analysis
Stereotactic analysis of all postoperative MRI scans was performed in a blinded fashion by a 
single rater. Both preoperative and postoperative MRI scan sets were imported into a 
stereotactic surgical planning software package (FrameLink, Medtronic, Inc.), 
computationally fused, and reformatted to produce images orthogonal to the anterior 
commissure–posterior commissure line and midsagittal plane.20 Data collected included the 
position of the deepest contact, the coronal and sagittal angles of the trajectory, the distance 
of the bur hole from the midline and target, the coordinates of the active contact and the 
distance of that contact from the fornix, lead and fornix coordinates at z = 0, lead and 
mammillary body coordinates at the level of the mammillary bodies, ventricular width, third 
ventricular width, skull width,4 and the sagittal angle of the column of the fornix. In 
addition, there were 54 leads for which the coordinates for the preoperative stereotactic plan 
were documented; for these leads, the vector and radial errors relative to the final lead 
placement (Fig. 1) were collected. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to measure 
the extent of the linear association between 2 variables.

  Patient Outcomes
AEs were recorded at each institution and presented to an independent clinical events 
committee for adjudication. Each AE was adjudicated for relatedness to the study, surgical 
procedure, IPG, leads, and programming. AEs were also categorized as general medical, 
psychiatric, surgical, or programming in nature. In addition, adjudications were made 
regarding whether an event was a serious AE (SAE) or an unanticipated adverse device 
effect. Typically, events requiring extended hospitalization, hospital readmission, or 
reoperation were considered to be SAEs.
 RESULTS
 Patients
Between June 6, 2012, and April 28, 2014, a total of 42 patients were enrolled who 
underwent surgery by 7 neurosurgeons at 6 participating hospitals. The mean age of these 
patients was 68.2 ± 7.8 years (Table 1), and the mean duration since the initial diagnosis of 
AD was 2.3 ± 1.7 years. The mean ADAS-cog-11 score was 16.9 ± 2.9.
 Operative Data
 Stereotactic Targeting—Stereotactic planning was performed on a surgical navigation 
station. Direct targeting methods were used, based on visualization of the descending 
columns of the fornix on MRI. A transventricular trajectory was necessary, and planning 
took into account the orientation of the fornix, location of the optic tracts, and avoidance of 
the sulci and blood vessels. The electrodes exited the ventricles above the midcommissural 
plane and passed posterior to the anterior commissure, from which point the intended 
trajectory ran parallel and approximately 2 mm anterior to the columns of the fornix, 
traversing the hypothalamus and ending posteromedial to the optic tracts (Fig. 2).
The mean coordinates of the planned target relative to the midcommissural point were x = 
5.2 ± 1.0 mm (range 3.0–7.9 mm), y = 9.6 ± 0.9 mm (range 8.0–11.6 mm), and z = −7.5 
± 1.2 mm (range −5.4 to −10.0 mm). (For the purpose of clarity, the left- and right-sided 
electrodes are combined for this analysis, and the x coordinates are listed as positive values. 
However, in the Cartesian coordinate system used for stereotactic planning and analysis, the 
points on the left side of midline are assigned a negative value and the points on the right are 
assigned a positive value.) The mean coronal angle was 12.5 ± 4.6° (range 1.7°–26.5°) and 
the mean sagittal angle was 67.9 ± 8.5° (range 41.7°–82.0°). The mean distance from the 
midline of the bur hole was 21.5 mm, and distance to the target from the outer skull was 83.7 
mm.
 Operative Technique and Duration—The DBS electrodes were placed using 
standard frame-based stereotactic methods (Leksell [Elekta AB], n = 37; CRW [Integra 
Radionics, Inc.], n = 5), followed by the placement of the IPG under general anesthesia. 
Because of the proximity of the ventricle ventral to the contacts, guide cannulas were placed 
to the target and subsequently raised to expose the electrodes for intraoperative test 
stimulation. Testing was performed in a monopolar or bipolar configuration at a frequency 
of 130 Hz and a pulse width of 60 μsec, with the voltage increased slowly up to 7 V or until

 side effects occurred. The observed AEs included autonomic phenomena and cognitive 
effects. All patients experienced autonomic AEs, which consisted of increased blood 
pressure and heart rate in response to stimulation. Experiential phenomena, similar to those 
previously reported,12 were observed in 3 patients. Intraoperative imaging consisted 
ofanteroposteriorandlateralfluoroscopy. One lead was repositioned intraoperatively, due to 
deflection of the cannula into the third ventricle. The mean total operative time, including 
lead and battery placement, was 4.1 ± 1.6 hours (range 2.1–8.5 hours).
 Postoperative Imaging and Stereotactic Accuracy
The mean coordinates of the targeted contact (i.e., contact 0) on postoperative MRI was x = 
4.4 ± 1.1, y = 9.8 ± 1.8, and z = −7.2 ± 1.5. Relative to the stereotactic plan, the mean vector 
error was 2.2 ± 1.2 mm (range 0.4–6.3 mm) and the mean radial error was 1.5 ± 1.0 mm 
(range 0.2–4.0 mm). There was no statistically significant difference in error between the 
left- and right-sided leads (vector error, p = 0.98; radial error, p = 0.89).
At the midcommissural plane (i.e., z = 0), the mean coordinates of the electrodes were x = 
5.8 mm and y = 12.4 mm, and the mean coordinates of the fornix were x = 4.9 mm and y = 
10.5 mm. The mean distance from the center of the lead to the center of the fornix at the 
midcommissural plane was therefore 2.7 ± 1.0 mm. The tip of the electrode was typically 
near the plane of the mammillary bodies. The mean coordinates for the mammillary bodies 
were x = 2.8, y = 3.5, and z = −7.2; at the plane of the mammillary bodies, the coordinates of 
the lead were x = 4.5, y = 9.8, and z = −7.2. Therefore, the mean distance between the 
electrode and the mammillary bodies was 6.8 ± 1.5 mm.
 Anatomical Considerations—The mean intercommissural distance was 25.9 ± 1.7 
mm (range 22.2–29.4 mm). The mean third ventricular width was 8.5 ± 2.5 mm (range 3.8 –
13.6 mm), and the bicaudate ratio was 0.19 ± 0.03 (range 0.13 –0.26). There was no 
significant correlation between stereotactic error (radial or vector) versus atrophy (third 
ventricular width or bicaudate ratio) (r2 ≤ 0.0124 for all 4 comparisons). The mean angle of 
the fornix in the sagittal plane was 65.7° ± 7.5° (range 52.2°–79.6°; Fig. 1A). The difference 
between the mean sagittal angles of the fornix and of the lead was 6.8 ± 5.5° (range 0°–
25.5°).
 Postoperative Course
 Hospitalization—All patients were admitted to the hospital for at least 1 night. In this 
cohort, the mean interval from the end of surgery to discharge from the hospital was 1.4 
± 0.8 days. One patient underwent prolonged hospitalization due to headaches on 
postoperative Day 1, followed by nausea and vomiting on postoperative Day 2. All patients 
were discharged home under the care of their families.
 Active Contacts—Programming was set after monopolar review and documentation of 
thresholds and description of AEs. On the basis of this and the surgeon’s input regarding the 
closest contact to the fornix on postoperative imaging, a clinician who was not blind to the 
programming would designate an active contact. This was Contact 2 (i.e., the third contact 
from the tip) in 79.2% of leads, Contact 1 in 11.0% of leads, and Contact 3 in 9.8% of leads.

 The mean coordinates relative to the midcommissural point of the active contact were x = 
5.6 ± 1.2 mm, y = 12 ± 1.6 mm, and z = −1.5 ± 1.4 mm. These were on average 1.8 ± 0.9 
mm (range 0–3.8) away from the fornix.
 AEs Within 90 Days
Before adjudication, 32 (76.2%) patients were reported to have 131 AEs within 90 days of 
surgery. After adjudication, 26 (61.9%) patients were found to have 64 AEs likely related to 
the implant procedure (Table 2). Nonrelated events typically included worsening or 
fluctuation of pre-existing problems (such as arthritis pain or baseline mood disorder), early 
reoperation for unrelated disease (e.g., cataract surgery or dental procedures), new diagnoses 
not likely related to AD (e.g., basal cell carcinoma), unrelated traumatic injury (including 
orthopedic fractures and lacerations), infectious illness unlikely to be nosocomial (e.g., 
influenza), unexpected laboratory findings that could not be mechanistically linked to the 
procedure (e.g., hypo- or hyperglycemia), or the expected normal sequelae of DBS-f surgery 
(e.g., sensation of some battery movement or experiential phenomena).
Of the 64 AEs related to the procedure, 57 (89.1%) occurred within 30 days of implant (Fig. 
3). Sixteen of 42 patients (38.1%) had no AEs reported. Eleven of 42 patients (26.2%) 
experienced 1 AE, and the remaining 15 (35.7%) experienced more than 1 AE (Fig. 4).
Most AEs (46 of 64; 71.9%) were directly related to the operative procedure itself (Fig. 5). 
General AEs (14 of 64; 21.9%) included potentially nosocomial infections (such as early 
postoperative urinary tract infections), contact dermatitis (likely due to surgical adhesives), 
headache, nausea, and other medical problems. Psychiatric events (such as postoperative 
delirium or confusion) accounted for 4 of the 64 AEs (6.3%).
The specific categories most frequently associated with AEs consisted of findings related to 
the surgical sites (Fig. 6): 20 of 64 (31.3%) AEs were determined to be “minor” and related 
to the surgical site (including transient erythema or swelling; discomfort due to implanted 
hardware; and, in 1 case, a small, nonoperative, incidentally identified intracerebral 
hematoma); 5 of 64 (7.8%) AEs determined to be “serious” were related to the surgical site 
(see below). The next most common AE (15 of 64; 23.4%) was headache and/or other pain, 
which is frequently associated with neurosurgery in general.
Five patients (11.9%) experienced 7 SAEs (Table 2; Fig. 6). Four (9.5%) patients required a 
return to surgery: 2 of 3 patients who had IPG infections required explantation (the third 
patient was treated with oral antibiotics), 1 patient required repositioning of a misplaced 
electrode lead, and 1 patient was treated for chronic subdural hematoma. The remaining 2 
SAEs consisted of 2 episodes of headache and/or nausea and vomiting in a single patient 
who required 2 extra nights of hospitalization. The mean interval from initial surgery to the 
7 serious AEs was 18.3 days (range 0–60 days). No programming-related AEs or 
unanticipated adverse device effects were reported. There were no reported neurological 
deficits, and no instances of mortality in the study population.

  Readmissions
 Hardware Infection—One patient presented with signs of infection around the IPG site 
starting at postoperative Day 7, and the device was immediately explanted. Two days later, 
after further observation and the return of the laboratory results, the remaining components 
of the system (extensions and leads) were also explanted. This patient then successfully had 
an IPG reimplanted 2 months later. Another patient presented with signs of infection at the 
IPG site at 14 days postoperatively and underwent washout without explantation. This 
patient subsequently presented with a chest abscess at 87 days after the initial implant, at 
which point complete explantation was performed.
 Hematoma—One patient presented 60 days postoperatively, after a ground-level fall that 
caused a clavicle fracture, and was found to have bilateral chronic subdural hematomas with 
mass effect. Along the parasagittal frontal lobe, which was the entry point for the DBS lead, 
about 1 cm of cerebrospinal fluid was present between the skull and the gyrus, and the 
patient had marked pneumocephalus postoperatively. The hematomas were believed to be a 
consequence of the pneumocephalus, and were surgically drained via bilateral bur holes. A 
CT scan of the head (obtained as part of the 6-month PET study included in the full 
ADvance Trial) was obtained 4.4 months after the hematoma evacuation and demonstrated 
the complete resolution of the hematoma.
 Lead Repositioning—One lead was determined to be inappropriately positioned 
relative to the fornix on postoperative imaging, and the patient was readmitted 7 days later 
for uncomplicated lead repositioning.
 DISCUSSION
The purpose of the ADvance Trial is to evaluate the feasibility of using DBS-f to treat 
patients with AD. In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled study, the 
descending limbs of the fornix are targeted for electrical stimulation in patients with mild, 
probable AD.
The rationale for this therapeutic approach is 2-fold: 1) there is an absence of promising 
pharmacological options for patients with AD,10 but 2) there are prior pilot data evaluating 
DBS-f.12 The pilot study that preceded the ADvance Trial suggested a possible slowing of 
cognitive decline in some patients, as well as increased glucose metabolism in the parietal 
and temporal lobes that persisted after 1 year of DBS-f, in contrast to the decreased 
metabolism that is typically observed in AD patients.19 More recently, it has been reported 
that 2 patients from the pilot study demonstrated an unprecedented reversal of the 
progressive hippocampal atrophy that is characteristic of AD.17
More than 140,000 patients have been implanted with DBS systems worldwide for other 
indications (http://professional.medtronic.com/pt/neuro/dbs-md/prod/index.htm). DBS-f 
consists of the use of an FDA-approved medical device in an off-label manner. The surgical 
technique for DBS-f in AD patients is nearly identical to that used for other applications of 
DBS. Unique to DBS-f are the brain locations where the electrodes are placed (i.e., the 
target), the purpose of electrical stimulation for intraoperative testing (i.e., autonomic side

 effects and possible experiential phenomena), and the patient population (i.e., AD patients). 
The safety profile of DBS surgery when used for other indications has been well 
characterized and can be used for comparison with the experience reported here.
 Stereotactic Targeting
Some technical considerations are specific to DBS-f. First, stereotactic targeting for this 
procedure is performed via direct visualization of the fornix. Placing a cannula such that it 
ends 10 to 20 mm above target, as is often done with DBS in order to leave the electrodes 
exposed for intraoperative testing, would leave the end of the cannula within the ventricle, 
potentially allowing the bare electrode to deflect off the wall of the ventricle and thus miss 
the target. Therefore, in this study, the cannulas were typically placed fully on the target.
Second, whereas stereotactic targeting typically has the goal of placing the electrode into the 
targeted structure, such an approach with the fornix would run the risk of injuring the fornix 
and worsening cognitive impairment. Therefore, careful attention must be paid during 
planning to avoid the fornix, yet nevertheless the fornix must be within sufficiently close 
proximity to the electrodes to be within the field produced by the electrical stimulation. 
Microlesion effect, which is seen with DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus, globus 
pallidus pars interna, or subthalamic nucleus, is to be avoided in DBS-f. In our experience, 
there was no radiographic evidence of fornix damage and there were no acute postoperative 
cognitive changes suggestive of injury to the fornix.
Third, the ventral-medial to dorsal-lateral trajectory of the descending columns of the fornix 
is different from the ventral-lateral to dorsal-medial trajectory of DBS electrodes. While the 
trajectories on sagittal imaging appear parallel, they are actually skewed and this demands a 
more nuanced approach to targeting in order to optimize the proximity of the 10.5-mm span 
of the DBS contacts to the fornix. Furthermore, as noted, the surgical plan requires a 
transventricular approach, which is further addressed below.
 Intraoperative Test Stimulation
DBS surgery offers the opportunity for intraoperative test stimulation. For example, with 
essential tremor, a lead can be repositioned if tremor arrest is not produced or if the side 
effects are intolerable during test stimulation. Consistently throughout this trial, activation of 
the distal contacts resulted in autonomic AEs such as tachycardia and hypertension. This 
served as one form of validation that the electrodes were intraparenchymal (as opposed to 
intraventricular) and within the hypothalamus. This maneuver is not without risk and could 
conceivably increase the risk of hemorrhage or affect a patient’s cardiac status; however, 
these events were not observed in our cohort.
 Safety Considerations With DBS-f
When compared with the safety profile of DBS for PD, the safety profile of DBS-f in the 
ADvance Trial was noteworthy in part because of 3 factors: 1) surgery was performed on 
patients with dementia; 2) simultaneous bilateral electrodes were placed; and 3) a 
transventricular trajectory was used. These 3 factors may increase the risk of DBS-f

 compared with DBS of other targets, and they have been regarded as risk factors in the 
setting of DBS for PD.
Regarding the first factor, patients with PD who are considering DBS typically undergo 
screening by a neuropsychologist, and patients who demonstrate significant cognitive 
decline are typically not considered good surgical candidates.11,13,15 Mild cognitive 
impairment is frequently diagnosed during this preoperative workup, and it becomes an area 
to address when counseling patients and families on the risks and cognitive side effects of 
DBS.
Significant cognitive impairment is typically regarded as a relative contraindication to DBS 
surgery. Nevertheless, in our cohort of patients with early-stage, probable AD, there were 
relatively few reports of mental status change in the postoperative period. Only 4 instances 
of confusion or delirium were reported, and these were transient. This surprisingly low 
incidence may have been related to the early stage of the disease at which patients 
underwent implantation, or perhaps to factors related to this specific target and trajectory. 
Alternatively, delirium may have been underreported because active delirium screening was 
not done. Longer term assessment of potential impairment is underway.
Another potentially relevant feature of our patient population is the degree of cerebral 
atrophy, which is typically greater in patients with AD than in other patients undergoing 
DBS. Cerebral atrophy could impair accurate stereotactic targeting because a smaller ratio of 
cerebrum to cranium could allow for greater “brain shift” once bur holes are made to allow 
cerebrospinal fluid to escape and air to enter. However, stereotactic accuracy in this study 
was comparable with that reported for other patient populations.5
In contrast to the placement of simultaneous bilateral electrodes in our study, many centers 
stage the placement of electrodes into the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Staging may 
be recommended due to concerns about safety,8 brain shift that may result in stereotactic 
error,14 or cognitive AEs, with the latter being particularly relevant in the setting of elderly 
patients or patients with mild cognitive impairment. No difference in accuracy between the 
right and left leads was noted.
A transventricular trajectory was used in our patients; however, there has been a growing 
consensus that the ventricles should be avoided in DBS surgery for reasons related to 
accuracy as well as safety,23 the latter because a transventricular approach entails the 
additional penetration of 2 ependymal surfaces. Ben-Haim et al.2 reported that traversing the 
ventricle contributed significantly to the overall hemorrhage rate in 246 microelectrode-
guided lead implantations, while Kramer et al.9 recently reported a comparison of 46 
patients with a transventricular trajectory to 19 patients with no transventricular trajectory 
that identified no significant difference in the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage or the 
number of microelectrode trajectory attempts. In addition to the fornix, other DBS targets, 
such as the pedunculopontine nucleus and the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, require a 
transventricular approach, and electrode placements have been performed safely without 
intraventricular hemorrhage.7,21,24 There were no intraventricular hematomas in the present 
cohort of 42 patients and 84 ventricular penetrations. On the basis of our experience, we

 believe that the risk attributed to ventricular penetration with other DBS procedures may be 
overstated in the medical literature.
Overall, these specific factors did not appear to contribute to the overall morbidity of 
patients undergoing DBS-f. This may be due to strict screening for healthy patients, as is 
typical in such trials, or it may suggest a low or nonexistent incremental risk associated with 
simultaneous bilateral electrode placement, transventricular trajectories, or the performance 
of DBS-f in patients who are mildly cognitively impaired.
 AEs
The complication rates associated with DBS surgery include symptomatic hemorrhage 
(1.1%–1.4%), wound infection (1.7%–8%), and hardware failure (1.5%–36%).3,6,18 Less 
common complications include seizure, delirium/ psychosis, venous air embolism, and 
ischemic stroke. Serious AEs occurred in 11.9% (5 of 42) of the patients in this study, which 
is consistent with rates reported in other DBS trials.8,22
Because AD is characterized by marked, progressive brain atrophy, the patient population in 
this study would be expected to have more atrophy than others who might undergo DBS 
surgery. Cerebral atrophy is generally considered a risk factor for DBS surgery, and the 
degree of brain atrophy is typically reviewed as part of the preoperative workup. The mean 
bicaudate ratio reported in this study, 0.19 ± 0.03, is slightly larger than the ratio of 0.16 
± 0.02 reported by Brickman et al. 4 for a cohort of 84 patients with probable AD. (A higher 
bicaudate ratio suggests a greater degree of cerebral atrophy; in the study by Aylward et al.,1 
the mean bicaudate ratio for normal controls was 0.09 ± 0.02.) A greater volume of 
extraaxial space could potentially contribute to a greater risk of procedure-related subdural 
hematoma, whether due to the stretching of bridging veins across this space or less resilience 
of the atrophic brain to reexpand in the event of postoperative pneumocephalus. Certain 
other risks would not be expected to differ in this procedure compared with other DBS 
procedures. For example, the risk of infection seems unlikely to be modified in this setting. 
Nevertheless, the AD patient population is potentially different from the PD, essential 
tremor, or dystonia populations in ways that are currently unappreciated yet relevant to 
infection risk.
 Limitations and Future Directions
Discussing the potential therapeutic benefit of DBS-f for patients with AD is beyond the 
scope of the present report. In the context of the ADvance Trial, these data will remain 
unknown until the last patient completes the 1-year, double-blind, stimulation-versus-sham 
phase of the study. The primary purpose of this report is to describe the surgical and 
technical aspects of DBS-f, as well as the safety profile in this specific cohort of patients 
with mild probable AD.
In light of the relatively small size of this study, no conclusive risk-related statements can be 
made at this time. Nonetheless, the surgical experience reported here can inform future 
studies that aim to assess DBS for the treatment of AD. These data do suggest that 
transventricular surgery can be performed safely in this cohort of patients with dementia 
without causing surgical damage to the fornix.

 There may be other risks specific to the application of electrical stimulation to this region of 
the brain, such as alterations that affect cognition or perception. However, because the study 
remains in a blinded phase, the attribution of any functional derangement to stimulation 
cannot yet be made; such an assessment cannot be made until it is known which patients 
were assigned to the “on-stimulation” state.
The mechanism by which DBS-f may enhance cognition is unknown. For other conditions, 
the effect of electrical stimulation is not to reverse the primary disease process or modify the 
natural history, but rather to modulate neural circuits in such a way as to functionally 
compensate for the deficits resulting from that pathology. In addition to clinical outcomes, 
data being collected for the ADvance Trial include structural and metabolic imaging that 
may contribute to our mechanistic understanding of the disease.
 CONCLUSIONS
In the ADvance Trial, patients with mild, probable AD underwent bilateral DBS-f electrode 
placement via a transventricular approach, followed by the placement of an IPG. The 
perioperative course was similar to that seen in DBS trials for PD, including the incidence of 
complications. Up to postoperative Day 90, there was no evidence of permanent 
neurological morbidity and no instances of mortality. This experience suggests that bilateral 
DBS-f can be performed safely and is well tolerated in this population. The safety and 
efficacy of 1-year electrical stimulation in this patient cohort remain to be evaluated.
