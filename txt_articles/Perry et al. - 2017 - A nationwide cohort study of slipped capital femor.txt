AbstrAct
Objectives To describe the epidemiology of slipped 
capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), to examine associations 
with childhood obesity and socioeconomic deprivation, 
and to explore factors associated with diagnostic delays.
Design Historic cohort study using linked primary and 
secondary care data from the Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics.
setting All contacts with healthcare services, including 
emergency presentations, outpatient appointments, 
inpatient admissions and primary care visits, within the 
UK National Health Service.
Patients All individuals <16 years old with a diagnosis 
of SCFE and whose electronic medical record was held 
by one of 650 primary care practices in the UK between 
1990 and 2013.
Main outcome measures Annual incidence, missed 
opportunities for diagnosis and diagnostic delay.
results Over the 23-year period the incidence 
remained constant at 4.8 (95% CI 4.4 to 5.2) cases per 
100,000 0–16-year-olds. There was a strong association 
with socioeconomic deprivation. Predisease obesity was 
also strongly associated with SCFE; mean predisease 
z-score of body mass index was 1.43 (95% CI 1.20 to 
1.68) compared with the UK reference mean. Diagnostic 
delays were common, with most children (75.4%) 
having multiple primary care contacts with relevant 
symptomatology, and those who presented with knee 
pain having significantly longer diagnostic delay (median 
161 (IQR 27–278) days) than those with hip pain (20 
(5–126)) or gait abnormalities (21 (7–72)).
conclusions SCFE has a strong association with both 
area-level socioeconomic deprivation and predisease 
obesity. The majority of patients with SCFE are initially 
misdiagnosed and those presenting with knee pain are 
particularly at risk.
IntrODuctIOn
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is the 
most common hip disease of adolescence.1 Severe 
cases can lead to complete collapse of the femoral 
head, and SCFE is the most common reason for 
hip replacement surgery in both adolescence and 
early adulthood.2 Early recognition of SCFE is 
important as the deformity may worsen if the slip 
remains untreated.3 Previous studies have found 
that symptom duration is associated both with the 
degree of slip and clinical outcome, as determined 
by surrogate measures such as compensation 
payments.4–6
Unfortunately, hip disorders may present atyp-
ically in children, which can lead to diagnostic 
delays.3 7 8 It is therefore important to understand 
both the epidemiology of SCFE and the spec-
trum of symptoms with which new cases present 
to healthcare providers. In particular, there have 
been a number of recent calls to raise awareness 
among non-specialists to ensure prompt recogni-
tion and referral of patients.9 10
The epidemiology of SCFE is poorly docu-
mented. The few studies of incidence vary consid-
erably in methodological quality, and meaningful 
comparisons are difficult because of their hetero-
geneous denominator populations.1 11–13 SCFE 
incidence has been ecologically linked to child-
hood obesity,1 11–13 although there is little strong 
evidence to support this association. Most studies 
have been retrospective case series from specialist 
centres14–16 that may suffer from referral bias 
and poor generalisability to the wider popula-
tion. These studies also typically recorded patient 
weights after diagnosis, and it is plausible that 
obesity could result from exercise modification 
following disease progression.
This study is the first to use linked hospital and 
community-based records to describe the epidemi-
ology of SCFE in a population cohort. It sought 
to test for an association with premorbid obesity, 
socioeconomic deprivation and comorbid diseases 
and to explore factors associated with diagnostic 
delays.
What this study adds?
 
► Diagnosis of SCFE is often delayed and there is 
evidence of missed opportunities for diagnosis 
in primary care.
 
► Children with atypical symptoms (particularly 
knee pain) are at greatest risk of misdiagnosis, 
despite this being a recognised presentation of 
SCFE.
 
► SCFE is strongly associated with area-level 
socioeconomic deprivation and premorbid 
obesity.

► Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is an 
important cause of disability in children and 
young adults.
 
► Delay between onset of SCFE symptoms and 
treatment may worsen the prognosis.
 
► There is an association between SCFE and

MethODs
Data sources
The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) is the English 
National Health Service (NHS) observational data and interven-
tional research service, jointly funded by the National Institute 
for Health Research and the Medicines and Healthcare Products 
Regulatory Agency (MHRA). CPRD GOLD is a large database 
containing the longitudinal medical records from approximately 
650 primary care providers throughout the UK. It was launched 
in 1987 and now includes active records for 5.5 
million indi-
viduals, that is, around 8% of the UK population. The data are 
well recorded17 and has been shown to provide results that are 
consistent with other data sources in the UK. A detailed descrip-
tion of CPRD is available elsewhere.17 18 Linked inpatient data 
using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are available from 1997 
onwards following the introduction of a unique NHS number for 
each individual patient. HES data contain details of all contacts 
(admissions and attendances) with English NHS healthcare 
providers. All NHS healthcare providers in England, including 
acute hospital trusts, primary care trusts and mental health 
trusts, contribute data to HES. Linkage to HES was available for 
357 of the 650 primary care providers contributing to the CPRD 
(HES does not cover Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, hence 
is not available at all of these sites, nor in a proportion of English 
primary care providers who do not contribute linked data).
case identification and validation
Cases were extracted from both CPRD and HES if they had 
a diagnostic code indicative of SCFE between 1 January 
1990 (CPRD) or 1 April 1997 (HES) and 31 March 2014 
(see online supplementary appendix 1). When a case was iden-
tified, further support for the diagnosis was sought within both 
the same and the other data set. This was achieved by examining 
the diagnostic and procedural codes 2 
years either side of the 
SCFE diagnosis date. The strength of the validation was classi-
fied using a validation algorithm (more details are available in 
online supplementary appendix 1).
Cases were included if they satisfied both the following 
criteria: (1) age above 6 years old, and 16 years or under on 
the day of the diagnostic record of SCFE and (2) at least 1 
year 
of prior up-to-standard (UTS) data within their computerised 
record. UTS is a term used by CPRD to denote that a practice 
has continuous high-quality data sufficient for use in research.19 
There were no exclusion criteria, although outliers with respect 
to age were examined to determine their validity.
Where linkage was available and there was good evidence to 
support the diagnosis, the index date of diagnosis was determined 
to be the earliest date within the two databases (if different). In 
all other instances the earliest diagnostic record was assumed to 
represent the index date.
Denominators were obtained from CPRD to calculate the 
annual incidence of disease for 0–16-year-olds stratified by age, 
sex, year, region and quintile of socioeconomic deprivation. 
Socioeconomic deprivation quintiles were available at a patient-
level for patients within England.20 External validity of the 
data set was assessed by comparing the age and sex distribution 
of cases identified to those published previously.1
Socioeconomic deprivation quintiles were established by 
CPRD using small area-based measures of deprivation. Small 
area deprivation was determined using routinely collected 
national data that include seven components: (1) income, (2) 
employment, (3) health deprivation and disability, (4) educa-
tion, skills and training, (5) barriers to housing and services, (6) 
crime, and (7) the living environment.20 Deprivation scores were 
assigned according to postcode by the National Statistics Office. 
The English Index of Multiple Deprivation divides England 
into 34 378 lower layer super output area with approximately 
400 households or 1500 residents for each region.20 Premorbid 
obesity was examined using the most recently recorded body 
mass index (BMI) prior to the index date of diagnosis within the 
primary care record.
Prediagnosis symptomatology was investigated among indi-
viduals for whom a diagnostic record was evident within both 
data sets (ie, validation code 1, 2 or 3). Predetermined symptom 
codes were categorised as ‘hip pain’, ‘knee pain’ and ‘altered 
gait’ and ‘miscellaneous leg pain’ (see online supplementary 
appendix 1). CPRD entries with a relevant symptom code were 
recorded if they occurred within 2 
years of diagnosis. After the 
initial symptom code record, the number of subsequent primary 
care contacts with a relevant symptom code was determined.
Diagnoses commonly associated with SCFE within the litera-
ture (hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, renal failure, 
renal osteodystrophy, Down’s syndrome and radiotherapy) were 
examined for their prevalence prior to the SCFE diagnostic code 
using CPRD diagnostic codes and associated prescription medi-
cation codes (see online supplementary appendix 1).
Ethics approval was given for the use of CPRD data for 
this study by the UK MHRA Independent Scientific Advi-
sory Committee. The article conforms to the guidance of the 
REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routine-
ly-collected Data (RECORD) statement.21
statistical analysis
Poisson CIs were calculated for rate estimations, and trends 
were examined using Poisson regression. The Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney test was used to examine the age distribution of cases 
by gender. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance was used 
to explore differences in days to diagnosis by presentation cate-
gory. All statistical analyses were undertaken using Stata V
.14.
The age of the individual at the BMI record was only available 
to researchers in whole years and so a consistent midyear point 
(ie, 10.5 years) was used to determine SD scores. SD (z-) scores 
were calculated using the Medical Research Council lmsGrowth 
module22 for Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA), 
which calculates z-scores based on age and sex using UK 1990 
reference data. BMI records from the first year of life were 
excluded.
results
Five hundred and ninety-six unique patients were identified 
with a diagnostic code of SCFE over the study period within the 
data sets (figure 1). The validation algorithm found that 88% 
of diagnoses could be validated, and 86% of cases for whom 
CPRD-HES link was available (n=394) could be externally

Incidence
The overall crude incidence rate was 4.8 (95% CI 4.4 to 5.2) 
cases per 100 
000 0–16-year-olds. The disease incidence among 
boys was 1.7 times greater than among girls 5.7 (95% CI 5.1 to 
6.3) vs 3.9 (95% CI 3.4 to 4.4) cases per 100 
000 0–16-year-
olds. The age distribution demonstrated that the peak age of 
diagnosis was 12–13 years old (figure 2, further breakdown is 
available as supplementary tables). Subgroup analysis suggested 
that the median age at diagnosis was 1 
year earlier among girls, 
with the peak age of diagnosis being 12 years vs 13 years among 
boys (p<0.001).
Over the 25-year study period there was no significant varia-
tion in the annual incidence of SCFE (figure 3), although there 
was a peak in diagnoses between 2000 and 2005. There were 
no significant seasonal differences in diagnosis or evidence of 
substantial regional variation.
socioeconomic deprivation
Three hundred and ninety-two cases within England had an 
available patient-derived area-level socioeconomic deprivation 
score. There was a strong association between area-level depri-
vation and incidence of SCFE (figure 4). The incidence of SCFE 
increased from 4.1 (95% CI 3.2 to 5.2) cases per 100 
000 in the 
least deprived quintile (quintile 1), to 6.4 (95% CI 5.0 to 7.9) 
cases per 100 
000 children in the most deprived quintile (quintile 
5). Poisson regression revealed a significant increase in the rate 
of SCFE with each quintile of worsening deprivation incidence 
rate ratio (IRR) 1.12 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.21, p<0.001) (figure 4).
symptomatology and diagnostic delays
T
wo hundred and fifty-four of 337 children (75.4%) had a rele-
vant diagnostic code that preceded their SCFE diagnosis by 
less than 2 
years. The median number of additional primary 
care contacts with a relevant symptom code, following the first 
symptom presentation to the time of the diagnostic record, was 
1 (IQR 1–2). The median number of days from first presentation 
with a relevant symptom code, to diagnostic record was 26 (IQR 
5–156). Symptom category was significantly associated both with 
time to diagnosis and the number of presentations before a diag-
nosis was recorded (table 1). Presentations with an initial record of 
knee pain demonstrated the greatest delay (median days to diag-
nosis 161 (IQR 27 –278) vs 20 (5–126) with record of hip pain,

childhood bMI
One hundred and seventy-four children had a BMI recorded within 
their electronic medical records prior to the diagnosis of SCFE. A 
diagnostic record of SCFE was strongly associated with a higher 
mean z-score, with the mean recorded BMI being 1.43 (95% CI 
1.20 to 1.68) SD above the UK reference mean (figure 5).
comorbid disease associations
Of the 596 children within the cohort, 16 (2.7%) children had 
either a diagnostic code of hypothyroidism or a prescription record 
for thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Other comorbidities 
investigated (Down’s syndrome, renal failure, renal osteodystrophy, 
growth hormone deficiency and radiotherapy) had very low overall 
prevalence, with only 8 (1.3%) children having either a diagnostic 
or drug code of any of these diseases. We are unable to report these 
numbers in further detail in accordance within our licence agree-
ment regulating the reporting of small numbers.
DIscussIOn
This is the first study to examine the epidemiology of SCFE 
using linked primary and secondary care records. The overall 
incidence throughout the study period was 4.8 (95% CI 4.4 to 
5.2) cases per 100 
000 0–16-year-olds, that is, approximately 
624 (95% CI 572 to 676) new cases of SCFE per year in the UK, 
based on 2015 population estimates of 13 million children in 
this age range, or a lifetime SCFE risk of approximately 1:1300 
to individuals. We found a strong association with premorbid 
obesity and socioeconomic deprivation, as well as frequent 
delays in correctly diagnosing new SCFE cases.
external validation
The sex ratio demonstrated a strong male predominance, with 
the mode age of disease presentation between 12 and 13 years 
old, and an earlier peak among girls. These findings are consis-
tent with other studies.1 12 14 23 The incidence rates were compa-
rable with those published for Scotland (approximately 5 per 
100 
000 6–18-year-olds).1 These similarities suggest that the 
diagnostic codes used in this study are a true reflection of SCFE 
incidence in the UK.
longitudinal and geographical trends
There was no significant fluctuation in incidence rates by time 
or geographical area. The highest incidence of SCFE occurred 
in 2001. Murray and Wilson1 and Maffulli and Douglas23 both 
independently analysed data from Scotland between 1980 and 
2000, and identified a gradual increasing frequency of SCFE. 
Our data suggest that, after a peak incidence in 2001, there was 
a gradual decline in the incidence of SCFE. Interestingly, data 
from the Health and Social Care Information Centre suggest a 
peak in prevalence of UK childhood obesity at a similar time 
(2004), with a gradual reduction afterwards.24 These observa-
tions may provide further ecological evidence to support an 
association with obesity. Our study was unable to reproduce 
the seasonal association reported by one previous study, which 
suggested that children were at higher risk of SCFE during the 
summer months.14
Obesity
Previous case series have reported an association between obesity 
and SCFE. However, these often recorded BMI following diagnosis, 
which is problematic because obesity could also be a consequence 
of exercise limitation caused by SCFE. However, our study found 
that individuals with SCFE have a much higher BMI (recorded 
before SCFE diagnosis) than a comparable British reference popu-
lation.22 The mean BMI was approximately 2 SD above ‘normal’ 
for all children with SCFE whose height and weight were recorded 
between 10 and 16 years old. This supports the finding of one 
previous small study (n=26) that found early BMI abnormalities in 
children prior to the diagnosis of SCFE,16 and several larger series 
from specialist centres that report strong associations with obesity 
among children affected by SCFE.12 14 15 However, only 174 chil-
dren had a BMI recorded within their medical records prior to 
diagnosis, which may introduce a selection bias. Such individuals 
may have had their BMI recorded owing to a particular concern 
(eg, obesity), which may therefore misrepresent the cohort. The 
consistent evidence from various study designs is however sugges-
tive that there is a strong association between obesity and SCFE. 
The true nature of the obesity association requires a prospective 
cohort study of childhood BMI linked to subsequent morbidity 
outcomes, although a sufficiently large cohort of children is diffi-
cult to identify.
Deprivation
This study is the first to examine the association between SCFE and 
socioeconomic deprivation. It demonstrated that quintiles of small 
area-level socioeconomic deprivation are associated with increased 
disease incidence. One limitation of this approach is that area-based 
deprivation may lead to ecological error by assuming homogeneity 
among individuals enumerated within each region. Assigning an 
area score to an individual may therefore misclassify individuals 
who are atypical for their region. Although the mechanism under-
lying the association between area-level deprivation and SCFE 
incidence is unclear, one possibility is childhood obesity, which is 
known to be independently associated with socioeconomic depri-
vation.25 This association may therefore represent further ecolog-
ical evidence of an association between SCFE and obesity.

was established. Importantly, patients who initially presented 
with knee pain were less likely to be diagnosed promptly than 
those with hip pain or gait abnormalities. This is important 
because one-third of patients initially presented with knee symp-
toms. The finding that patients with SCFE with knee pain are 
less likely to be diagnosed promptly supports the conclusions of 
smaller studies from specialist centres.3 26 There is evidence to 
suggest that increased time to diagnosis worsens both the degree 
of hip deformity and prognosis.6 14 Diagnostic delays are there-
fore a major source of litigation in both hospitals and primary 
care.7 The Medical Defence Union, which is just one of the 
providers of medical indemnity to doctors in the UK, manages 
5–10 claims related to diagnostic delays in SCFE each year, 
which can each settle for up to £500 
000 (US$612 000) (Medical 
Defence Union, personal communication, 2016). It is therefore 
particularly important that non-specialist doctors recognise the 
potential significance of knee pain in children, as they are most 
likely to encounter patients with undifferentiated SCFE at their 
initial presentation. Examination and documentation of hip 
movements are therefore fundamental when examining a child 
with knee pain, particularly if pretest probability (eg, based on 
age and body habitus) is high for SCFE. We acknowledge the 
limitation that there is uncertainty that the child did not have 
an alternative cause of pain at initial consultation; however, 
even closely reviewing individual medical records, it would not 
be possible to differentiate these from SCFE. The finding that 
diagnostic delays were associated with knee pain supports the 
existing literature of hospital case series.
comorbid diseases
The overall prevalence of associated diseases was very low, and 
these diseases appear to contribute little to the development of 
SCFE at a population level. Nevertheless, we recognise that the 
risk to an individual of SCFE may be higher once diagnosed with 
an associated disease, particularly hypothyroidism. Although this 
association could not be quantified in the absence of a control 
group, the absolute contribution of comorbid diseases to SCFE 
in the UK appears to be small.
cOnclusIOn
This is the first study to link primary and secondary care data in 
order to describe the epidemiology of SCFE. In addition to char-
acterising patients who are at greatest risk, it has confirmed the 
ecological association between obesity and SCFE. It also high-
lighted the difficulties inherent in correctly diagnosing SCFE in 
primary care, particularly when children present ‘atypically’ with 
knee pain. The data suggest that these patients are less likely to 
be diagnosed promptly, which might contribute to worse clinical 
outcomes and claims for clinical negligence. This highlights the 
need for judicious clinical examination and due consideration of 
hip signs when children present with knee pain.
