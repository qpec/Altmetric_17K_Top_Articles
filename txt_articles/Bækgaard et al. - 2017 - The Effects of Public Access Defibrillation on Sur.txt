SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
BACKGROUND: Despite recent advances, the average survival after out-
of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains <10%. Early defibrillation by 
an automated external defibrillator is the most important intervention for 
patients with OHCA, showing survival proportions >50%. Accordingly, 
placement of automated external defibrillators in the community as 
part of a public access defibrillation program (PAD) is recommended by 
international guidelines. However, different strategies have been proposed 
on how exactly to increase and make use of publicly available automated 
external defibrillators. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect 
of PAD and the different PAD strategies on survival after OHCA.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were 
systematically searched on August 31, 2015 for observational studies 
reporting survival to hospital discharge in OHCA patients where an 
automated external defibrillator had been used by nonemergency 
medical services. PAD was divided into 3 groups according to who applied 
the defibrillator: nondispatched lay first responders, professional first 
responders (firefighters/police) dispatched by the Emergency Medical 
Dispatch Center (EMDC), or lay first responders dispatched by the EMDC.
RESULTS: A total of 41 studies were included; 18 reported PAD by 
nondispatched lay first responders, 20 reported PAD by EMDC-dispatched 
professional first responders (firefighters/police), and 3 reported both. 
We identified no qualified studies reporting survival after PAD by EMDC-
dispatched lay first responders. The overall survival to hospital discharge 
after OHCA treated with PAD showed a median survival of 40.0% (range, 
9.1–83.3). Defibrillation by nondispatched lay first responders was associated 
with the highest survival with a median survival of 53.0% (range, 26.0–72.0), 
whereas defibrillation by EMDC-dispatched professional first responders 
(firefighters/police) was associated with a median survival of 28.6% (range, 
9.0–76.0). A meta-analysis of the different survival outcomes could not be 
performed because of the large heterogeneity of the included studies.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review showed a median overall 
survival of 40% for patients with OHCA treated by PAD. Defibrillation by 
nondispatched lay first responders was found to correlate with the highest 
impact on survival in comparison with EMDC-dispatched professional 
first responders. PAD by EMDC-dispatched lay first responders could be a 
promising strategy, but evidence is lacking.

STATE OF THE ART
E
ach year, >350 
000 individuals in North America 
and 300 
000 individuals in Europe have an out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).1,2 Despite efforts to 
improve the outcome, the average survival after adult 
OHCA remains <10%.3–5
As time passes, the number of patients with a shock-
able rhythm decreases,3,6,7 and as a result, the chance 
of survival diminishes with 7% to 10% for every min-
ute that passes without intervention.6 Early defibrilla-
tion, preferably before emergency medical services 
(EMS) arrival, is therefore a crucial predictor for OHCA 
survival.3,7,8 Placing automated external defibrillators 
(AEDs) in the community as part of a public access de-
fibrillation program (PAD) has shown survivals between 
50% and 70%.9–14 As a result, PAD programs are rec-
ommended by the 2015 guidelines from the Ameri-
can Heart Association and the European Resuscitation 
Council.8,15 In agreement with these recommendations, 
national PAD programs have been implemented in sev-
eral countries,16–20 and numerous states in the United 
States have made AED availability mandatory in certain 
public places.21
Despite the increasing availability and recommenda-
tions of PAD, <5% of all patients with OHCA are defi-
brillated before the arrival of EMS.7,22 Because time to 
defibrillation is crucial for improved survival, early defi-
brillation is the primary concern, whereas who brings 
the AED is of lesser importance. Several strategies have 
been proposed on how to increase and make the most 
of PAD. At present, 3 strategies exist: nondispatched 
lay first responders (on-site AED), professional first re-
sponders such as firefighter or police (mobile-AED) 
dispatched by the emergency medical dispatch center 
(EMDC), or EMDC-dispatched lay first responders (on-
site or mobile AED).
Whereas current guidelines on resuscitation recom-
mend PAD programs,8,15 the effect on OHCA survival 
according to type of PAD strategy has not previously 
been examined. We therefore performed a systematic 
review with the aim to evaluate the effect of 3 different 
PAD strategies on OHCA survival to hospital discharge.
METHODS
The systematic review is reported in accordance with the 
PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses) guidelines,23 which is endorsed by 
numerous journals.24 The protocol for this study is registered 
in the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (registration 
number: CRD42014013468).25
Systematic reviews do not require approval by institutional 
review committees, nor do study subjects need to reconsent 
and this was therefore not sought.
Eligibility Criteria
We developed the research question following the PICOS 
(population, 
intervention, 
comparison, 
outcome, 
and 
study design) format, as recommended by the Cochrane 
Collaboration.26 We identified studies reporting results from 
patients with OHCA (=population) with AED attachment or 
defibrillation by nonmedical professionals before the arrival 
of the EMS (=intervention). We did not mandate that stud-
ies include a control group. We included studies reporting 
survival to hospital discharge or 30-day survival reported in 
percentages (=outcome). To ensure comparability between 
studies, only observational studies, written in English, report-
ing OHCA of >10 patients were accepted (=study design). We 
excluded letters, case reports, abstracts, conference papers, 
and reviews. Studies including only patients <18 years of age 
were also excluded. PAD was divided into 3 subgroups accord-
ing to who had deployed the defibrillator: nondispatched lay 
first responders (laypersons initiating cardiopulmonary resusci-
tation [CPR] without direction of the EMDC and deploying an 
on-site AED), professional first responders dispatched by the 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Current guidelines on resuscitation recommend 
public access defibrillation (PAD) programs to 
improve the survival from out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrest (OHCA), but do not distinguish between dif-
ferent types of PAD strategies.
• This systematic review examined the effect on 
OHCA survival according to type of PAD strategy.
• Our analysis showed a median overall survival to 
hospital discharge after OHCA treated with PAD of 
40.0% (range, 9.1–83.3).
• Defibrillation by nondispatched lay first respond-
ers was associated with the highest survival with 
a median of 53.0% (range, 26.0–72.0), whereas 
defibrillation by Emergency Medical Dispatch 
Center–dispatched professional first responders 
(firefighters/police) was associated with a median 
survival of 28.6% (range, 9.0–76.0).
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• This systematic review shows that early defibril-
lation by nondispatched lay first responders or 
Emergency Medical Dispatch Center–dispatched 
professional first responders (firefighters/police) 
correlates with increased survival after OHCA.
• Nondispatched lay first responders seem to have 
the potential to save the highest proportion of 
patients with OHCA.
• Focus on engaging laypersons to either use an on-
site automated external defibrillator or dispatch 
them via the dispatch center should be prioritized, 
because not only can they reach the patient with 
OHCA quicker, but they can also reach patients 
with OHCA in residential areas.
• New PAD strategies with Emergency Medical Dis-
patch Center–dispatched lay first responders could 
be a promising strategy, but evidence is lacking.

EMDC (firefighters or police equipped with an AED), or lay first 
responders dispatched by the EMDC (laypersons directed to an 
OHCA with the help of the EMDC, eg, via a text-message alert 
system or smartphone-based system, and using either an on-
site or mobile AED). Whenever it was not transparent whether 
the AED had only been attached or had been attached and 
defibrillated, we categorized it as only attached.
Information Sources and Search Methods
We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, and 
the Cochrane Library on August 31, 2015. The full electronic 
search strategy can be seen in Figure 1.
The search strategy was further modified to fit Embase 
and the Cochrane Library.
Study Selection
Two reviewers (S.V. and J.S.B.) independently screened titles 
and abstracts. Interrater reliability was calculated using 
Cohen’s κ statistics. The same reviewers independently 
screened full texts of the selected studies. Here, disagree-
ment was resolved by discussions until consensus. Data 
extraction and assessment of risk of bias were performed 
by the first author (J.S.B.) and confirmed by a second author 
(S.V.). If patient data overlapped between publications, they 
were considered as duplicate publications. The publica-
tion covering the longest time period was selected and the 
other(s) excluded.
To ensure capture of all important studies, all reference 
lists of the screened full-text studies were evaluated by the 
first author and judged whether to pursue further.
Data Collection Process and Data Items
Data were extracted into predetermined tables by the 
first author (J.S.B.). Data on study characteristics included 
study period, study duration, geographical location, study 
design, name of registry, and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale 
score. Data on AED circumstances and outcomes included 
proportion of CPR, proportion of witnessed OHCA, AED 
provider (nondispatched lay first responders, EMDC-
dispatched professional first responders [firefighters/police], 
or EMDC-dispatched lay first responders), proportion of 
initial shockable rhythm, number of patients with interven-
tion, and survival to hospital discharge/30-day survival in 
percentages. In case the studies had divided survival into 
subgroups, we combined these to generate the overall sur-
vival, by using the formula for combining groups from the 
Cochrane handbook.27

STATE OF THE ART
Risk of Bias in Individual Studies
Risk of bias was assessed by using the Newcastle Ottawa 
Scale, which is developed specifically for nonrandomized 
interventional studies and comparative studies.28 A study 
can be awarded from 0 to 9 stars, with 9 stars represent-
ing a low risk of bias, and 0 stars a high risk of bias. Stars 
are awarded according to representativeness of the exposed 
cohort (maximum 2 stars), ascertainment of exposure (maxi-
mum 1 star), assessment of outcome adequacy of follow-
up for cohorts (maximum 1 star), demonstration that the 
outcome of interest was not present at the start of the 
study (maximum 1 star), follow-up being long enough for 
outcomes to occur (maximum 1 star), selection of the non-
exposed (maximum 1 star), and comparability of cohorts 
on the basis of the design or analysis (maximum 2 stars). 
The 2 last-mentioned points could never be awarded to our 
included studies as per the study design, and thus our stud-
ies could be awarded a maximum of 6 stars. The stars serve 
as an indicator of the quality of the specific studies and can 
serve as guidance for the readers to compare the reported 
results between studies.
The median and range of Newcastle Ottawa Scale values 
are presented for the included studies.
Statistical Analysis
The median survival to hospital discharge was calculated for 
each subgroup. Because of the pronounced heterogeneity 
in the subgroups, it was impossible to perform meaningful 
meta-analyses.29 The calculations and figures were performed 
by using RStudio Version 0.99.486.
RESULTS
Through our literature search, we identified 5166 re-
cords. After the removal of duplicates and nonorigi-
nal research, 2432 studies were assessed for inclusion 
through title and abstract screening. Here, 200 studies

were included with a Cohen’s κ of 0.76 (95% confi-
dence interval, 0.71–0.81; 2-sided P value<0.001). Full 
text eligibility of the remaining studies was assessed, of 
which 159 studies were excluded, leaving 41 studies 
from 11 different countries in our review (Figure 2).
The median study duration was 40.5 months (range, 
10–504). All studies were either prospective or retro-
spective observational studies. Study characteristics are 
summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
Of the 41 included studies, 18 reported nondis-
patched lay first responder AED usage,7,11,18,30–44 and 20 
studies reported EMDC-dispatched professional lay first 
responder AED usage.13,14,45–62 We identified 3 studies 
that reported both groups.10,22,63 We did not identify 
any studies reporting AED usage by the third subgroup, 
EMDC-dispatched lay first responders. The individual 
study outcomes are summarized in Tables 3 and 4.
Three of the studies reported an outcome of 30-day 
survival,7,40,63 whereas the remaining reported survival 
to hospital discharge. The median proportion of sur-
vivors after OHCA where AEDs were reported to be 
attached (and the defibrillation status was unknown 
or not specified) by non-EMS was 22.3% (range, 4.0–
78.0). The median proportion of survivors after OHCA 
where an AED was confirmed to have defibrillated the 
patient was 40.0% (range, 9.0–76.0).
When the 2 subgroups were examined separately, 
we found the median proportion of survivors to be 
32.0% (range, 14.0–78.0) when nondispatched lay first 
responders had attached the AED, and 11.5% (range, 
4.0–21.1) when EMDC-dispatched professional first re-
sponders (firefighters/police) had attached the AED.
It is notable that when an AED was confirmed to have 
defibrillated the patient with OHCA, the median propor-
tion of survivors to hospital discharge was 53.0% (range, 
26.0–72.0) for the subgroup of nondispatched lay first 
responders, and 28.6% (range, 9.0–76.0) for EMDC-dis-
patched professional first responders (firefighters/police).
The results are illustrated in Table 5. Information on 
the cerebral performance category scores of the survi-
vors was extremely limited but can be found in Tables I 
and II in the online-only Data Supplement.
The risk of bias between the studies showed our 
highest possible median Newcastle Ottawa Scale score 
of 6 (range, 3–6). Only 6 of the studies were awarded a 
score <6 (4 studies received 5 stars, 1 received 4, and 1 
received only 3 stars) indicating the overall high quality 
of our included studies.
DISCUSSION
Summary of Evidence
In this systematic review of observational studies, we 
aimed at evaluating the effect on survival to hospital 
discharge for patients with OHCA according to type 
of PAD strategy implemented. Our review showed a 
median survival to hospital discharge after OHCA of 
40% when patients were defibrillated before EMS 
arrival by PAD. Furthermore, survival after OHCA 
seemed to be higher when the patient was defibril-
lated by nondispatched lay first responders in com-
parison with EMDC-dispatched professional first re-
sponders (firefighters/police), with a median survival 
to hospital discharge of 53.0% (range, 26–72) and 
28.6% (range, 9–76), respectively. We did not iden-
tify any studies describing long-term survival after 
defibrillation performed by EMDC-dispatched lay first 
responders.
PAD is recommended by the 2015 American Heart 
Association Guidelines and the 2015 European Resusci-
tation Council Guidelines, as well.8,15 The recommenda-
tions are based on studies demonstrating increased sur-
vival after OHCA following defibrillation with an AED 
before the arrival of EMS.11 However, the guidelines 
do not distinguish between the different types of PAD 
strategies. Our review found that different PAD strate-
gies were associated with much higher survival propor-
tions than those reported for OHCA treated by EMS 
only, which average ≈10% to 12%.64,65 Regardless of 
the PAD strategy, this may be explained by a reduced 
time from collapse to CPR and defibrillation with an 
AED,66,67 because the chance of survival decreases by 
7% to 10% for every minute that passes without in-
tervention.6
Accordingly, the better outcome of PAD by non-
dispatched lay first responders (=on-site AED) in 
comparison with PAD by EMDC-dispatched profes-
sional first responders (=mobile AED), may also be 
explained by a faster on-scene arrival, and thus a de-
creased time to defibrillation. A recent Dutch study 
supports this, because it shows nondispatched lay 
first responders shock patients with OHCA after a 
median of 4:06 minutes (interquartile range, 2:23–
6:40 minutes), whereas EMDC-dispatched profes-
sional first responders (firefighters/police) shock the 
patients after a median of 8:03 minutes (interquartile 
range, 6:43–10:13).68 The Public Access Defibrillation 
Trial also supports training and equipping volunteers 
to attempt early defibrillation within a structured re-
sponse system, and found that doing so may double 
the number of survivors to hospital discharge after 
OHCA.69
Our review did not identify any studies describing 
defibrillation performed by EMDC-dispatched lay first 
responders. However, focus on EMDC-dispatched lay 
first responders is rapidly developing because it is 
thought to potentially cover a large population. This 
would include arrests in residential areas, where 70% 
of OHCAs occur,72 and where the effect of on-site 
AEDs is limited.69,71 A recent randomized clinical trial 
from Sweden showed increased rates of bystander

CPR and shorter time to defibrillation in comparison 
with EMS, when volunteers were activated via a mo-
bile phone–positioning system and sent to OHCAs 
within 500 m of them.12 In the Netherlands, com-
parable effects were seen in a study where mobile 
phone text messages sent lay responders within 
1000 m of patients with suspected OHCA to per-
form bystander CPR and use AEDs.68 In the United 
States and the United Kingdom, similar text mes-
sage systems are appearing.72,73 Engaging laypersons 
to either use an on-site AED or dispatch them via 
the EMDC thus seems especially promising, because, 
not only can they reach the patient with OHCA more 
quickly, but they can also reach patients with OHCA

ing this subgroup’s effect on survival after OHCA are 
lacking, but a randomized control trial from Korea 
with this outcome is under conduction.74 However, it 
is noteworthy that the focus of this review was not 
the means of providing access to AEDs.
Strengths and Limitations at Study and 
Outcome Level
Definitions of the terms PAD and first responder lack 
consistency throughout the included studies. Some un-
derstand PAD to be a possibility solely for laypersons,

whereas others understand it to include firefighters and 
police. The term first responder is understood to include, 
or exclude, EMS personnel with variation. These confu-
sions are partly because of definitions changing over 
time and the lack of consensus on the terms. Whenever 
the definitions used for PAD and first responders were 
impossible to interpret, the studies were excluded.
Furthermore, to ensure equal etiologies of the car-
diac arrests, we excluded studies that only reported sur-
vival of patients <18 years of age.
Because the majority of studies failed to specify 
whether AEDs were only attached to the patient with 
OHCA (eg, because of a nonshockable rhythm) or de-
livered a shock, we categorized it as only attached in 
case it was not clear. As a result, it is assumed that the 
studies in this group include a high degree of hetero-
geneity.29 Furthermore, the inclusion criteria among the 
included studies, eg, in terms of witness status, were 
found to be highly diverse. For these 2 reasons, it was 
not possible to undertake a meta-analysis.
Strengths and Limitation at Review Level
Our review is conducted according to the PRISMA 
guidelines guaranteeing a uniform and systematic ap-
proach, and transparency of the methods, as well.23 
Studies from a variety of countries are included, cre-
ating a broad perspective. To ensure homogeneity in 
methodology, only observational studies are included in 
our review. Survival to hospital discharge and 30-day 
survival are clearly 2 different outcomes. However, be-
cause the ease of collecting information within differ-
ent healthcare systems varies, the Utstein recommen-
dations accept both survival to hospital discharge and 
30-day survival as survival end points.75 When compar-
ing cardiac arrest survival across several studies, it there-
fore seems inevitable not to include both forms of sur-
vival reporting. We did, however, exclude studies only 
reporting return of spontaneous circulation to ensure 
an estimation of the long-term effect of PAD.
Furthermore, only studies written in English were 
included, and studies containing <10 cases of OHCA 
were excluded to weaken potential publication bias.
Only a few of the included studies evaluate the ce-
rebral performance category score of the survivors, and 
this outcome could therefore not be fully explored de-
spite its importance (Tables I and II in the online-only 
Data Supplement). However, a recent Danish study 
showed that 76.6% of survivors of OHCA, who were 
employed before their cardiac arrest, returned to work, 
suggesting that the majority of survivors to hospital dis-
charge in the included studies obtain a good cerebral 
outcome.76 Finally, studies describing the group of lay 
first responders appear to be of newer date than stud-
ies describing the group of professional first respond-
ers. Although newer AED devices and more knowledge 
may improve survival independently, we chose not to 
exclude the older studies, because a sensitivity analysis 
showed only a minor improvement in survival for the 
professional first responders of 2.2% points when the 
year of publication was taken into account.
CONCLUSION
This systematic review reports a median survival to hos-
pital discharge of 40% for patients with OHCA defi-
brillated before the arrival of EMS by PAD programs. 
In addition, significantly higher survival was associated 
with defibrillation by nondispatched lay first responders 
in comparison with EMDC-dispatched professional first 
responders (firefighters/police). New methods of AED
