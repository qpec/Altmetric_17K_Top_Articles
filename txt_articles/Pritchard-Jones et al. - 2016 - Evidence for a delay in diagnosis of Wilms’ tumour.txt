 Evidence for a delay in diagnosis of
Wilms’ tumour in the UK compared
with Germany: implications for primary
care for children
Kathy Pritchard-Jones,1 Norbert Graf,2 Harm van Tinteren,3 Alan Craft4
ABSTRACT
The UK has a longstanding system of general
practice which provides the vast majority of
primary care, including that for children. It acts
as a ’gatekeeper’ to more specialist care.
Parents may also use accident and emergency
departments as their first point of medical
contact for their children. Outcomes in the UK
for many conditions in children appear to be
worse than in comparable European countries
where there is direct access to care by
paediatricians. We have therefore looked at
pathways to diagnosis and compared
outcomes in the childhood kidney cancer,
Wilms’ tumour, which has been treated in the
UK and Germany within the same clinical trial
for over a decade. We find that Wilms’
tumours are significantly larger in volume and
have a more advanced tumour stage at
diagnosis in the UK compared to Germany.
There is a small (∼3%) difference in event free
and overall survival between the two
countries. Our data suggest that the system of
primary care for children in the UK is less
likely to result in the incidental finding of an
abdominal mass in a child with no or vague
symptoms. This may be a reason for the
poorer outcome.
INTRODUCTION
There has been much interest in recent
years in comparative cancer survival data
between different European countries for
adults and children. Concerns have been
raised about the possibility of worse out-
comes for children with Wilms’ tumour in
the
UK
since
the
publication
of
the
ACCIS
(Automated
Childhood
Cancer
Incidence and Survival) report in 2006.1
This
project,
coordinated
by
the
International
Agency
for
Research
in
Cancer, Lyon, brought together all of the
available
population-based
childhood
cancer registry data in Europe for a sys-
tematic analysis of incidence and survival
by tumour type. For children with Wilms’
tumour diagnosed in the period 1988–
1997, there was a small but significant dif-
ference in 5-year overall survival (OS)
between the British Isles (83%, 95% CIs
78% to 85%) compared with countries in
the North and W
est of Europe that is,
Scandinavia,
Benelux,
France
and
Germany (89%, 95% CIs 88% to 91%).
Survival differences may be due to one
or a combination of factors including
patient delay in presentation to medical
attention, delay in recognition in primary
care and referral for suspected cancer or
variable application of ‘best practice’ diag-
nostic workup and treatments in second-
ary care.2
Wilms’ tumour in children is an ideal
cancer in which to look at the influence
of these factors in childhood cancer. It is
one of the more common solid tumours,
affecting 1 in 10 000 children. Treatment
is standardised across Europe through the
majority of cases being treated within the
context of an international phase III clin-
ical trial with full patient demographic,
treatment and outcome data collected in a
comparable way. This overcomes the limi-
tation of population-based registry studies
where only OS can be compared with
ease.3 Since March 2002, the UK and
Republic
of
Ireland
participated
as
a
national group (Children’s Cancer and
Leukaemia
Group,
CCLG)
in
the
International
Society
of
Paediatric
Oncology (SIOP) Wilms’ tumour (WT)
2001 trial, in which the majority of par-
ticipating European countries do so at a
near-population level.4
National comparisons of patient
outcomes within an international
Wilms’ tumour clinical trial
The more detailed data in clinical trial
databases allows comparisons of relapse-
free survival as well as OS and the several
factors that determine the overall burden
of therapy each child requires. These in
turn dictate the risk of long-term morbid-
ity of their cancer treatment—a factor that
is extremely important in this childhood
cancer with an almost 90% cure rate and
with survivors expected to live a near
normal adult life expectancy. CCLG con-
tributed 18% of the patients registered in
the
trial,
that
now
includes
>5000
patients with renal tumour in its database.
Hence, for the first time in the 2000s, it
has been possible to compare directly the
patient characteristics, tumour stage distri-
bution and outcomes of children diag-
nosed in the UK with a contemporaneous,
virtually
population-based
trial
recruit-
ment in other W
estern European coun-
tries, all treated according to the same
protocol. W
e have chosen to use Germany
for the comparison with UK patients
entered into the SIOP WT 2001 trial and
study, as both national groups have add-
itional data on the route to diagnosis of
their
patients,
which
is
necessary
to
inform interpretation of any differences.
There is a marked and statistically sig-
nificant difference in the distribution of
tumour stage at diagnosis but not of histo-
logical risk group between patients regis-
tered in the UK compared with Germany
(table 1). These two parameters are the
main determinants of the risk-stratified
treatment that is assigned to each patient
in the trial. The adverse (higher) stage dis-
tribution in the UK is largely seen among
localised tumours, the small excess of
metastatic disease at presentation does not
reach
statistical
significance.
T
umour
volume
at
diagnosis
is
also
markedly
increased
in
the
UK
compared
with
Germany (table 1).
From this within-trial comparison, it
can be seen that children with Wilms’
tumour in the UK are diagnosed with sig-
nificantly more advanced disease than in a
comparable western
European
country.
There is no difference in the distribution
of histological risk groups, suggesting that
it is unlikely that there are significant dif-
ferences in tumour biology within these
populations. This increased burden of
disease at diagnosis translates into a small
difference in event-free survival (EFS) and
OS between the German (5-year EFS
87.6% (95% CI 85.4% to 89.9%); 5-year
OS 94.5% (95% CI’s 92.9% to 96.2%)
and UK (5-year EFS 84.5% (95% CI’s
81.6%
to
87.5%);
5-year
OS
91.3%
(95% CI’s 89.0% to 93.7%) patients (see
online supplementary figure S1). This sur-
vival difference of ∼3% appears confined
to the children who present with non-

 metastatic disease. This would be suffi-
cient to explain the small population-
based survival differences seen between
Germany and Great Britain in the ACCIS
studies in the past.1
Routes to diagnosis of Wilms’ tumour
One possibility for the less good outcome
is that children in the UK are presenting
later than they would do in other coun-
tries. In order to address this question, a
retrospective case note audit was under-
taken to examine the presenting symp-
toms and diagnostic interval of all patients
presenting with WT to three major UK
paediatric oncology centres, the Royal
Marsden Hospital (RMH), Great Ormond
Street Hospital (GOSH) in London and
the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle
(RVI). The analysis included all patients
registered in one of three consecutive
trials (UKW2, UKW3, SIOP WT 2001)
that
ran
between
1986
and
2011.5
Patients
were
categorised
into
three
groups and the time interval from first
symptom to presentation to medical atten-
tion was recorded:
A. Diagnosed through screening (either
for a recognised Wilms’ tumour pre-
disposition syndrome or investigation
of multiple congenital abnormality, or
detected during a routine child health
check)
B. Presented
with
non-tumour
related
symptoms (ie, an abdominal mass was
detected as part of an astute clinician,
usually a GP
, fully examining a child
whose parents were concerned about
other symptoms, or a junior doctor
detected the mass during clerking for
a routine medical procedure)
C. Presented with tumour related symp-
toms,
most
commonly
a
palpable
abdominal mass, abdominal pain or
haematuria
W
e have combined groups A and B into
‘asymptomatic’ for symptoms related to
Wilms’ tumour, and group C is ‘symptom-
atic’. Eighty-five per cent of children were
diagnosed in the symptomatic group and
there was no difference between the three
centres (GOSH 83%, RMH 87%, RVI
89%). Children in the symptomatic group
were significantly older (median 3.3 years,
IQR, 1.9, 4.7 years, range 0.1–16.6 years)
than the asymptomatic group (median
2.2 years,
IQR
1.0,
3.3;
range
0.3–
5.8 years;
Wilcoxon
rank-sum
test,
p<0.001). The time interval between the
onset of symptoms and presentation to
medical attention that led to onward
referral for specialist oncological manage-
ment was very short in all groups and was
usually 1–2 days, median of 1 week (IQR,
0.3, 2.0 weeks; range 0–32 weeks) in the
symptomatic group, showing that delay at
this stage is not a major factor. There was
a
higher
proportion
of
early
stage
tumours (72.7% stages I and II) in the
asymptomatic group compared with those
who were symptomatic (52.9%) stages I
and II, (Fischer’s exact test p=0.015).
This
suggests
that
patients
whose
tumours are diagnosed following tumour
related symptoms are more likely to have
more advanced disease that requires a
higher burden of therapy for stage III
(local spread within the abdomen) and
stage IV (distant spread or metastases).
This includes risk-stratified use of doxo-
rubicin, a chemotherapy agent carrying a
risk
of
long-term
cardiotoxicity,
and
radiotherapy,
neither
of
which
are
required for stages I and II tumours,
where the cancer is completely resected.
Survival according to route to
diagnosis
None of the 14 patients found by screen-
ing (group A) relapsed or died. Of the 39
found incidentally (group B), 6 (15%)
relapsed and 3 died and of the 307 diag-
nosed
with
tumour
related
symptoms
(group C), 53 (17%) relapsed and 33
(11%) died. There were no statistically
significant differences in either EFS or OS
between groups, even when groups A and
B are combined and compared with group
C. However, this result is likely to be due
to the small number of events, as the sig-
nificant
difference
in
tumour
stage
between groups would be expected to
translate into survival differences if larger
numbers of patients were studied.
Within the participating national groups
in the SIOP renal tumour study group
trials, only Germany routinely collects
data on route to diagnosis. Among 947
patients registered in the SIOP 93-01 trial
(1994–2001), they found a higher propor-
tion (27%) of children diagnosed either
through screening (10%) or following
assessment of non-tumour related symp-
toms (17%) (equivalent to our asymptom-
atic group) compared with only 14.7% in
the three-centre UK study. There was a
higher proportion of localised tumours
detected
in
this
category.
Conversely,
18.9%
of
children
presenting
with
tumour related symptoms had metastatic
disease at diagnosis, similar to the propor-
tion in the UK. The 5-year EFS was better
for
those
in
their
equivalent
of
our
‘asymptomatic’ group (86%) than in the
group
with
tumour
related
symptoms
(82%), although the difference did not
quite
reach
statistical
significance
(p=0.050)
(see
online
supplementary
figure S2).
Possible reasons for differences
observed
Similar international benchmarking com-
parisons of OS in adult cancer have sug-
gested that poorer outcomes are seen in
countries where general practitioners act

 as the gatekeeper to specialist care.6 Much
emphasis has been placed on determining
whether these survival differences are due
to late presentation to medical attention
or delayed diagnosis and referral after first
presentation. Our retrospective audit data
show that once a GP has a suspicion of an
abdominal mass, they refer promptly and
the system provides rapid access to diag-
nostic investigation and treatment. Our
international benchmarking data within
the same clinical trial provide good evi-
dence that a higher proportion of children
with renal tumours in Germany are diag-
nosed asymptomatically compared with
the UK. This is associated with a lower
tumour stage and better outcomes. W
e do
not think that the problem is one of late
referral after a suspicion of a tumour has
been recognised, rather it reflects a failure
to pick up relevant symptoms and signs
during other healthcare contacts.
Differences in national child healthcare
practices
Our data suggest that the root of the
poorer outcome could lie in the nature of
child health practices in the UK. Fewer
Wilms’ tumours are picked up incidentally
perhaps
because
there
is
less
routine
examination of children or full physical
examination of children with minor symp-
toms. The healthcare systems for children
in the UK and Germany are radically dif-
ferent
with
the
primary
contact
in
Germany being a primary care paediatri-
cian and in the UK a general practitioner.
In the UK developmental screening and
routine
health
checks
were
radically
reviewed by Hall and colleagues in 2000.
They
evaluated
the
effectiveness
and
pick-up rate of abnormalities at the mul-
tiple examinations which had previously
been
undertaken.
Their
conclusion
in
Health for All 47 was that a routine phys-
ical examination should be undertaken for
every newborn baby and again at around
6–12 weeks. They could find no justifica-
tion to recommend any further routine
examination
before
the
child
enters
school at age 5 years and suggested that
an examination then too is of question-
able value. Most of the routine examina-
tions are undertaken by health visitors
who are public health nurses. A child’s
primary medical care is provided by a
general
practitioner.
Hall
suggested
a
move from the active ‘child health surveil-
lance’ to one of a more passive ‘child
health
promotion’.
Bellman
and
Vijeratnam asked whether we have in fact
thrown the baby out with the bath water.8
In the UK less than 50% of general
practitioners
(GPs)
who
undertake
primary care for children have received
any
formal
paediatric
training
beyond
that which they get in general practice
training placements. Although many GPs
have
a
great
deal
of
experience
of
working with children, as they may con-
stitute up to 40% of their routine work-
load, parents often choose instead to take
their
child
to
the
Accident
and
Emergency department of a hospital.9 In
Germany the vast majority of primary
healthcare for children is provided by
primary
care
paediatricians.
They
are
office based and often have ultrasound
scanning machines in their offices and are
trained to use them. The routine health
screening mandated and reimbursed is
undertaken by these trained primary care
paediatricians at seven time points in the
first 2 years of life, then twice more up to
primary school age.
Conclusions and next steps
W
e suggest that the poorer outcome for
children with Wilms’ tumour in the UK
when compared with Germany may be
due to a delay in detection resulting in
children with larger and more advanced
stage tumours which require a greater
burden of therapy to treat successfully.
While it would be difficult to justify a
radical change in the way that children in
the UK receive their primary care on the
basis of Wilms’ tumour diagnosis alone,
there are concerns that children in the UK
have poorer outcomes for many illnesses
and conditions.10 However, in these other
disease
areas
it
is
more
difficult
to
measure whether the differences lie in the
standard of primary care for children. It is
therefore essential that the UK continues
to participate fully in the clinical studies
and trials of the European clinical trial
and study groups, where enhanced data
on the route to diagnosis and burden of
disease at diagnosis can be captured in a
standardised
fashion
for
international
benchmarking and analysis of time trends.
To continue to monitor this in a prospect-
ive fashion at a population level, we
initiated in 2012, a clinical observational
study,
IMPORT
(Improving
Population
Outcomes for Renal T
umours of child-
hood), that also investigates biomarkers
for improved risk stratification. The regis-
tration form includes questions on each
patient’s route to diagnosis and time inter-
vals, as suggested in the report of the
Children
and
Young
People’s
Health
Outcome Forum.11 The median tumour
volume at diagnosis for the first 218
patients registered in the IMPORT study
(September 2012 to May 2015) remains
elevated at 630 mL. This reinforces our
earlier findings that one of the reasons for
the poorer outcome seen for UK patients
in the international comparative studies is
likely to be later diagnosis in the UK.
W
e believe that our data could be used
to justify a fresh look at the training
requirements of general practitioners and
health
visitors
in
the
way
they
look
after children. Furthermore, consideration
should
be
given
to
more
integrated
working with paediatricians in the com-
munity setting, as suggested in the recent
call for a UK Child Survival Countdown
initiative to tackle UK child survival in a
European context.12 In 1976 the Court
Committee report, Fit for the Future,
recommended
the
strengthening
of
primary care for children by the training
of
general
practitioner
paediatricians
but this did not find favour. W
e now
present evidence that we should be recon-
sidering the way children are cared for in
the National Health Service.
