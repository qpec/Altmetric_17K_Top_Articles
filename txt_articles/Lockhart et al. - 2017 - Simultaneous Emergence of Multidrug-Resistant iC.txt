Background. Candida auris, a multidrug-resistant yeast that causes invasive infections, was first described in 2009 in Japan and 
has since been reported from several countries.
Methods. To understand the global emergence and epidemiology of C. auris, we obtained isolates from 54 patients with C. auris 
infection from Pakistan, India, South Africa, and Venezuela during 2012–2015 and the type specimen from Japan. Patient informa-
tion was available for 41 of the isolates. We conducted antifungal susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
Results. Available clinical information revealed that 41% of patients had diabetes mellitus, 51% had undergone recent surgery, 
73% had a central venous catheter, and 41% were receiving systemic antifungal therapy when C. auris was isolated. The median time 
from admission to infection was 19 days (interquartile range, 9–36 days), 61% of patients had bloodstream infection, and 59% died. 
Using stringent break points, 93% of isolates were resistant to fluconazole, 35% to amphotericin B, and 7% to echinocandins; 41% 
were resistant to 2 antifungal classes and 4% were resistant to 3 classes. WGS demonstrated that isolates were grouped into unique 
clades by geographic region. Clades were separated by thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, but within each clade isolates 
were clonal. Different mutations in ERG11 were associated with azole resistance in each geographic clade.
Conclusions. C. auris is an emerging healthcare-associated pathogen associated with high mortality. Treatment options are 
limited, due to antifungal resistance. WGS analysis suggests nearly simultaneous, and recent, independent emergence of different 
clonal populations on 3 continents. Risk factors and transmission mechanisms need to be elucidated to guide control measures.

The yeast Candida auris was described in 2009 after being 
recovered from the external ear canal of a patient in Japan [1] 
and was subsequently recognized as causing otitis media in 15 
patients from 5 hospitals in Korea [2]. Two years later, a report 
from South Korea described 3 bloodstream infections (BSIs) 
caused by C. auris [3], establishing that this new species was 
capable of causing invasive infections. Shortly thereafter, C. 
auris fungemia from several hospitals in India [4–6], South 
Africa [7], and Kuwait [8] was described.
C. auris exhibits resistance to fluconazole and variable sus-
ceptibility to other azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins. 
It phenotypically resembles Candida haemulonii and requires 
use of molecular methods for identification [9, 10]. C. auris 
can be a challenge to identify and treat, especially in resource- 
limited settings, where molecular identification may not be 
immediately available and access to antifungals other than flu-
conazole may be limited.
In 2015, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) was asked to assist with an outbreak of BSIs and positive 
urine cultures caused by presumed Saccharomyces at a hospi-
tal in Pakistan. The isolates were shipped to the CDC, where 
they were identified as C. auris, which had not previously been 
reported from Pakistan. At the same time, the CDC was aware 
of increasing numbers of cases of C. auris infections in both 
India and South Africa [4, 6, 7] and was subsequently notified

 Simultaneous Emergence of Candida auris • CID 2017:64 (15 January) • 135
of cases from Venezuela [11]. An international collaboration 
was established to better understand the epidemiology of C. 
auris, determine the extent of resistance and whether the emer-
gence of this organism was occurring independently in multi-
ple countries or was caused by the spread of a single outbreak 
strain. Here we report clinical characteristics of patients with 
C. auris infection, antifungal susceptibility patterns, and results 
of whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis of C. auris isolates.
METHODS
Case Patient Information
Case patient information was obtained using a standardized sur-
veillance case report form and was available for 41 (76%) of the 54 
patients with isolates. The CDC’s National Center for Emerging 
and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases determined that this project 
constituted a nonresearch public health surveillance activity.
Isolates
Fifty-four isolates from 54 patients during 2012–2015 were col-
lected from Pakistan (n = 18; 2 hospitals), India (n = 19; 3 hos-
pitals), South Africa, (n = 10; 8 hospitals), and Venezuela (n = 5; 
1 hospital) (Supplemental Table 1). In addition, the type speci-
men from Japan was included as was a retrospectively identified 
Pakistan isolate from 2008. Isolates were from blood (n = 27), 
urine (n = 10), soft tissue (n = 5), or other sites (n = 12).
DNA Purification and Isolate Identification
DNA was extracted using the ZYMO Research ZR Fungal/
Bacterial DNA MiniPrep kit [12]. Species identities were con-
firmed by sequencing the D1–D2 region of the 28S subunit of 
ribosomal DNA [13].
Antifungal Susceptibility Testing
Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed as described 
elsewhere [14]. C. auris–specific break points were defined 
conservatively based on those established for closely related 
Candida species. Because the modal minimum inhibitory con-
centration (MIC) to fluconazole was at the upper limit of the 
measured distribution, resistance to fluconazole was arbitrar-
ily set at ≥32 µg/mL. Other break points were ≥2 µg/mL for 
voriconazole (as for Candida krusei [14]), ≥8 µg/mL for the 
echinocandins (as for Candida parapsilosis and Candida guilli-
ermondii [14]), ≥128 µg/mL for flucytosine (above the achieva-
ble dose), and ≥2 µg/mL for amphotericin B.
WGS, Genomic Assembly, and Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Identification
Of 54 available isolates, 47 were selected for WGS. To improve 
assembly, 2 isolates were sequenced using the PacBio plat-
form, and all 47 isolates were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq. 
Sequencing libraries were prepared as described elsewhere [15]. 
Two previously published genomes of C. auris (ERR899743 and 
SRR1664627) from India were included [16, 17]. The reference 
genome was generated by de novo assembly of PacBio reads 
from isolate B8441, as described elsewhere [18], and used as 
a reference for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) call-
ing. SNPs were identified using 2 independent pipelines, as 
described elsewhere (see also the legend to Supplemental Figure 
1) [15, 19]. The SNP calls were filtered and included in the final 
matrix if they were not identified in repetitive regions, were 
found in <90% of the base calls at that position, and had a mini-
mum read depth coverage of 10. Reads that mapped to multiple 
locations and indels were excluded. Genome-wide SNP-based 
phylogenetic analyses was conducted using the maximum par-
simony algorithm in MEGA V6.06 software, [20]. Statistical 
significance of the phylogenetic tree was tested using bootstrap 
analysis with 1000 reiterations. Read data were deposited into 
the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Sequence 
Read Archive under BioProject PRJNA328792.
Azole Resistance Mutation Identification
For resistance gene analysis, orthologous sequences to Candida 
albicans ERG11 from SC5314 Assembly 22 (Candida Genome 
Database; http://www.candidagenome.org/) were extracted 
from each C. auris genome and aligned using a ClustalW align-
ment in MEGA V6.06 software [20]. Sequences were evalu-
ated for amino acid substitutions that corresponded to those 
described elsewhere within hot-spot regions in azole-resistant 
C. albicans [21].
Query of a Global Candidemia Surveillance Program for C. auris
To understand whether C. auris emerged after 2009 or had been 
overlooked or misidentified in the past, we queried an ongo-
ing international antifungal surveillance program, SENTRY 
(JMI Laboratories) [22] containing 15 271 candidemia iso-
lates collected from 152 international medical centers during 
2004–2015, including from Asia (n = 41), Europe (n = 50), 
Latin America (n = 15), and North America (n = 46). Isolate 
identification from 2004 to 2009 was confirmed using a com-
bination of morphological and biochemical tests. After 2009, 
all uncommon Candida species were subject to DNA sequenc-
ing and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of 
flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry [22]. Four presumed 
C. haemulonii (the most common misidentification of C. auris) 
isolates collected before 2009 were retrospectively reidentified 
as C. auris by using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
RESULTS
Case Patient Description
Demographic and clinical information was available for 41 
(76%) of 54 patients (Table 1). Nearly half (44%) of the patients 
with clinical information were from Pakistan (n = 18), 15 (37%) 
were from India, 5 (12%) were from Venezuela, and 3 (7%) were 
from South Africa. The median age was 54 years (interquar-
tile range [IQR], 24–69); 3 patients, all from Venezuela, were

neonates (≤28 days old); 26 (63%) were male. Diabetes mellitus 
was the most common underlying condition identified. Half of 
all patients (n = 21; 51%) had undergone surgery in the 90 days 
before having a culture yielding C. auris; the most common 
operations included abdominal surgery (n = 6) diabetic limb 
amputations (n = 5), and cardiac surgery (n = 3). Seventy-three 
percent (n = 30) had a central venous catheter, and 61% (n = 
25) had a urinary catheter. Forty-one percent of patients had 
received systemic antifungal therapy (primarily fluconazole) in 
the 90 days before C. auris infection. The median time from 
admission to diagnosis was 19 days (IQR, 9–36 days).
Fifteen patients did not receive any antifungal treatment 
and 7 (47%) of those died including 4 of the 5 patients with 
BSIs who received no treatment. Twenty-six patients received 
antifungal treatment, and 6 received ≥2 antifungals. Three 
patients received fluconazole alone, 1 of whom had a BSI and 
died. Fifteen patients received amphotericin B, 4 of whom had 
isolates resistant to amphotericin B; 2 patients with ampho-
tericin B–resistant isolates survived while the remaining 2 died. 
Eight patients were treated with caspofungin, including 1 whose 
isolate was resistant to caspofungin; 4 of these patients died, 
including the patient with the echinocandin-resistant isolate.
Overall, 59% (n = 24) of the patients died. Of the 25 
patients with BSIs, 17 (68%) died. Of the 7 patients with uri-
nary tract infections, 5 (71%) died, most likely of associated 
sepsis. Because of the seriousness of the underlying disease of 
many of the patients, whether and how much C. auris attrib-
uted to death could not be determined.

 Simultaneous Emergence of Candida auris • CID 2017:64 (15 January) • 137
Antifungal Susceptibility Testing
Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed on 54 isolates. 
The MIC range and the MICs for 50% and 90% of isolates 
are shown in Table 2, and the MIC distribution is shown in 
Supplemental Table 2. Using stringent break points, 50 isolates 
(93%) were resistant to fluconazole, 29 (54%) to voriconazole 
(≥2 µg/mL), 19 (35%) to amphotericin B (7 from Pakistan and 
12 from India), 4 (7%) to echinocandins (2 from India and 2 
from South Africa), and 3 (6%) (from India) were resistant 
to flucytosine. Two isolates, both from India, were resistant 
to fluconazole, voriconazole, echinocandins, and ampho-
tericin B. In all, 22 (41%) isolates were resistant to ≥2 classes 
of antifungals.
ERG11 Mutation Analysis
By comparing Erg11 amino acid sequences between C. albi-
cans and C. auris, 9 amino acid substitutions, which have been 
identified in resistant but not wild-type C. albicans isolates, 
were identified in all C. auris isolates. Three additional hot-spot 
amino acid substitutions were identified that have been either 
proposed or proved to significantly increase fluconazole resist-
ance in C. albicans [23, 24]. These substitutions were strongly 
associated with geographic clades: F126T with South Africa, 
Y132F with Venezuela, and Y132F or K143R with India and 
Pakistan (Figure 1, Supplemental Table 3).
WGS Analysis
WGS was performed on 47 isolates, including 16 from Pakistan, 
15 from India, 10 from South Africa, 5 from Venezuela, and 
the type specimen from Japan; 2 previously sequenced genomes 
from National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Sequence 
Read Archive were also included. The assembled genome size 
was 12.5 Mb, similar to that of other Candida species [25].
Reference-based phylogenetic analysis using the NASP pipe-
line identified approximately 119 000 shared SNPs, of which 
86% were parsimoniously informative. Phylogenetic analysis 
identified a strong phylogeographic structure comprising 4 dis-
tinct clades, which were separated by tens of thousands of SNPs 
and represented distinct geographic regions: South Asia (India/
Pakistan), South Africa, South America (Venezuela), and East 
Asia (Japan) (Figure 1). Far fewer SNPs were identified within 
each cluster; for example, <16 SNPs differentiated any 2 isolates 
from the South American clade, <70 SNPs differentiated any 2 
isolates from South Africa, and <60 SNPs differentiated 34 of 36 
isolates from South Asia. Two isolates, B8441, the Pakistan iso-
late from 2008, and B11112, also from Pakistan, differed from 
the rest of the South Asian strains by >600 SNPs. Furthermore, 
within the South Asian clade, 2 smaller clusters were iden-
tified. These clusters were associated with a single hospital in 
Pakistan and consisted of nearly identical strains (differences of 
<2 SNPs). Comparable results were obtained using the GATK 
pipeline for SNP calling (Supplemental Figure 1).
Candidemia Surveillance
In an effort to test whether C. auris had been misidentified or 
overlooked before the recent emergence, we queried the inter-
national surveillance program SENTRY, which contained 15 271 
Candida isolates collected from 2004 to 2015. Four isolates were 
identified as C. auris (from 2009, 2013, 2014, and 2015), 1 of 
which had been previously identified as C. haemulonii, further 
supporting the scarcity of C. auris before 2009.
DISCUSSION
C. auris is a globally emerging multidrug-resistant yeast that 
can cause invasive infections. Here we report C. auris infections 
from Pakistan, adding to previous reports from Japan, South 
Korea, India, South Africa, Venezuela, and Kuwait. Based on 
the large number of SNPs observed across 47 isolates from 4 
regions (South Asia, East Asia, South America, and South 
Africa) and minimal intraregion genetic diversity, WGS anal-
ysis suggests near-simultaneous emergence of C. auris in ≥4 
locations rather than recent spread from a single source [1, 2, 4, 
7, 8]. Although the causes for such emergence are not clear, they 
may include new or increasing antifungal selection pressures in 
humans, animals, or the environment.
One possible explanation for the apparent recent emergence of 
C. auris may be that this pathogen has not been previously rec-
ognized. To test this hypothesis, we performed a literature review 
and queried the available global culture collections. Although the 
first publication of C. auris was from 2009, the earliest reported 
C. auris isolate was found in a Korean isolate collection, hav-
ing come from a 1996 BSI in a pediatric surgery patient [3]. 
Furthermore, we identified a 2008 C. auris isolate from Pakistan, 
which had not been previously recognized [26]. However, to our 
knowledge, no other C. auris isolates from 1996–2009 have been 
reported. Our retrospective review of the SENTRY isolate collec-
tion, with 15 271 isolates of Candida from 4 continents, did not 
find C. auris isolates before 2009 confirming that this pathogen 
was not simply misidentified previously and was indeed rare. 
Examination of additional isolate collections from around the 
world would help to further validate this conclusion.

Increased clinical availability of antifungal agents may have 
contributed to the emergence of this organism. Amphotericin B 
has been available since 1954, fluconazole since 1991, and echino-
candins since the early 2000s, but access to these drugs occurred 
much later in resource-limited settings. Although accurate data 
on the antifungal prescription practices are difficult to obtain, 
anecdotal evidence suggests increased use in recent years of tri-
azoles and other antifungals for empiric treatment of surgical 
and other hospitalized patients. In South Africa, C. auris seems 
to have emerged more rapidly in private-sector hospitals where 
echinocandin use is much higher than in public-sector hospi-
tals [27]. Two of the echinocandin-resistant isolate came from 
South Africa, although neither patient received an echinocan-
din, suggesting exogenous spread between patients. The fact that 
a substantial proportion of patients in this investigation were 
receiving antifungal treatment when C. auris infection was diag-
nosed supports the hypothesis that antifungal selection pressure 
may, in part, be responsible for the emergence of C. auris.
C. auris is phylogenetically related to Candida species kru-
sei, lusitaniae, and haemulonii, which are known to have either 
Figure 1. Genetic relationships among isolates inferred using the maximum parsimony method. One of the 2 most parsimonious trees obtained (length, 126 798 base pairs 
[bp]) is shown. The de novo PacBio assembly, which was used as a reference to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in other isolates, contained 20 contigs 
(11 000–1.4 million bp long; mean length, 623 000 bp; N50 length, 1 million bp). The mean sequencing depth with Illumina was ×235 (range, ×50–×300), which corresponded 
to 96%–99% coverage of the genome. For all sites, the consistency index is 0.94; the retention index, 0.99; and the composite index, 0.93. Branch lengths were calculated 
using the mean pathway method and are in the units of the number of changes over the whole sequence. The final data set included a total of 119 188 positions. Numbers 
below branches show bootstrap values calculated using 500 reiterations. Isolates with known mutations in the hot spot of the ERG11 gene that are associated with azole 
resistance in Candida albicans are shaded green for Y132F, orange for K143R, and yellow for F126T substitutions. Unshaded isolates have none of these mutations.

intrinsic or inducible resistance to fluconazole [28], ampho-
tericin B [28], or both [10]. The C. auris isolates in the current 
study exhibit very high MICs for fluconazole, and all but 4 iso-
lates carried amino acid substitutions shown to significantly 
increase fluconazole resistance [21]. There were no isolates with 
high MICs (>2 µg/mL) for either itraconazole or posaconazole. 
Several isolates were shown to have in vitro resistance to the 
2 remaining major classes of antifungals, polyenes and echi-
nocandins, suggesting that resistance may be inducible under 
antifungal pressure. This finding poses an important clinical 
challenge. A small proportion of isolates demonstrated elevated 
MICs for all 3 major antifungal classes, severely limiting treat-
ment options.
WGS analysis demonstrated low genetic diversity among iso-
lates within each clade; even across the largest clade of 36 isolates 
from India and Pakistan, all but 2 isolates differed by <60 SNPs, 
despite the fact that isolates came from 5 hospitals, thousands 
of miles apart. A recent WGS study from India with 5 isolates 
demonstrated similar results [28]. Clonality within C. auris has 
been shown elsewhere using amplified fragment length poly-
morphism, multilocus sequence typing, and MALDI-TOF mass 
spectrometry using some of the same Indian isolates from our 
study [4, 6]; however, the low discriminatory power of those 
methods did not allow an assessment of genetic relatedness 
between isolates with identical genotypes [4, 6, 29, 30]. Our 
WGS analysis shows that the isolates from different regions dif-
fered by tens of thousands of SNPs; however, the mean number 
of SNPs within each geographic cluster was minimal (<70 for 
isolates within each cluster), again strongly suggesting recent 
independent emergence.
Our results raise concern that C. auris may spread within the 
hospital setting, evidenced by the presence of nearly identical 
isolates in 2 hospitals in South Asia. The fact that a majority 
of patients had a central venous catheter, a urinary catheter, 
or a recent surgical procedure as possible site of entry, and the 
timing of infection, a median of 19 days after admission, also 
support this hypothesis. Like other Candida infections, C. auris 
infections seem to be hospital acquired and occur several weeks 
into a patient’s hospital stay, suggesting an exogenous rather 
than endogenous source and a breach of infection control 
measures. The overall in-hospital mortality rate of 60% is sim-
ilar to or higher than those reported from these countries or 
regions: 52% in Pakistan [26], 44% in India [31], 46% in South 
Africa [32], and 72% in South America [33]. We were unable to 
examine time to clearance of infection; however, another study 
found persistent fungemia up to 3 weeks after initiation of anti-
fungal treatment [4].
The current study has a number of limitations. First, only 
limited clinical data were available for each patient, and clin-
ical data were not available for all patients whose isolates 
were included in the study. Second, we were unable to iden-
tify risk factors that were specific to C. auris because we did 
not have a comparison group of patients with other Candida 
infections from the same institutions [31]. Third, because 
there are no universally accepted break points for C. auris, 
antifungal resistance was inferred based on break points 
for other species. Fourth, extremely low genetic diversity 
of C. auris strains hampered our ability to understand the 
movement of isolates within each geographic area. Although 
WGS of isolates from a Pakistani hospital identified 2 sub-
clusters of nearly identical isolates, which was consistent 
with an ongoing nosocomial outbreak, the exceptionally low 
diversity among other South Asian isolates made it difficult 
to establish a relevant cutoff number of SNPs that would dif-
ferentiate this institutional outbreak from other isolates cir-
culating in the region.
C. auris has been documented in numerous countries on 3 
continents in the past 7 years. It is likely that there are other 
places where this organism is already circulating but has not 
yet been identified or reported, and it will probably emerge in 
new locations as well. Multidrug resistance and high associ-
ated mortality rates makes C. auris an emerging global threat. 
Of additional concern, C. auris may become widely established 
within certain regions, as evidenced by the fact that it now 
accounts for nearly 5% of candidemia in Indian intensive care 
units [5]. There are still many unanswered questions about 
C. auris, including why it has suddenly emerged, whether its 
clonal expansion and global distribution will level off or con-
tinue, how it is transmitted, and what infection prevention and 
control measures are needed to prevent its spread within hos-
pitals. Further research on risk factors for this infection, how 
it is acquired and transmitted, and how the fungus develops 
resistance are needed to control the spread of this pathogen.
