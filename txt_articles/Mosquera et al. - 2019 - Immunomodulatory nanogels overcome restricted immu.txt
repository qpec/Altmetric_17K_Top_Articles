Biomaterials-based nanovaccines, such as those made of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), can induce stronger 
immunity than soluble antigens in healthy wild-type mouse models. However, whether metabolic syndrome can 
influence the immunological responses of nanovaccines remains poorly understood. Here, we first show that 
alteration in the sensing of the gut microbiome through Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) and the resulting metabolic 
syndrome in TLR5−/− mice diminish the germinal center immune response induced by PLGA nanovaccines. The 
PLGA nanovaccines, unexpectedly, further changed gut microbiota. By chronically treating mice with antibiotics, 
we show that disrupting gut microbiome leads to poor vaccine response in an obesity-independent manner. We 
next demonstrate that the low immune response can be rescued by an immunomodulatory Pyr-pHEMA nanogel 
vaccine, which functions through TLR2 stimulation, enhanced trafficking, and induced stronger germinal center 
response than alum-supplemented PLGA nanovaccines. The study highlights the potential for immunomodulation 
under gut-mediated metabolic syndrome conditions using advanced nanomaterials.
INTRODUCTION
Biomaterials-based nanovaccines can mimic pathogens and are read-
ily phagocytosed by dendritic cells, which prime T cells and B cells 
in lymphoid tissues, such as lymph nodes. These nanovaccines often 
induce superior and controlled immune response compared to sol-
uble antigens in healthy, preclinical mouse models (1–4). In com-
parison to soluble antigens, polymeric nanovaccines, such as those 
made of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) (1–4), can protect the 
vaccine antigen from degradation and rapid clearance and co-deliver 
immunomodulatory molecules to boost immune recognition. How-
ever, previous work has mostly focused on healthy wild-type (WT) 
mouse models to understand the immune response without consider-
ing biological differences that may affect the immunological outcomes 
of nanovaccines. Here, we are particularly interested in understanding 
the role of metabolic syndrome as an umbrella disease because of its 
prevalence in the United States (34 to 39%) (5, 6) and worldwide 
(~25%) (7). To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous re-
ports exploring the performance of PLGA nanovaccines and other 
immunomodulatory nanomaterials in metabolic syndrome.
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolic disorders, such as 
systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and obesity (8, 9). The 
National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III 
definition (10, 11) is one of the most widely used criteria of meta-
bolic syndrome and incorporates the key features of hyperglycemia/
insulin resistance, visceral obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and 
hypertension. Metabolic syndrome can originate from a variety of 
factors such as gut microbiome, diet, and genetic mutations, among 
others (12). The gut microbiome is particularly interesting because 
it has been implicated as a cause of metabolic syndrome (8), and 
multiple lines of evidence link the gut microbiota and metabolic 
syndrome to the immune system and, more directly, to vaccine re-
sponse (13–15). In one example, mice deficient in Toll-like receptor 5 
(TLR5, a cell surface protein that senses flagella on gut bacteria) 
spontaneously developed metabolic syndrome (16) and have also 
been shown to have a poor soluble antigen response (17). In the latter 
study, soluble influenza vaccine response showed a direct correla-
tion between expression of TLR5 and the magnitude of the antibody 
response. The study further showed that TLR5-mediated sensing of 
the microbiota also affected antibody responses to the inactivated 
polio vaccine. Despite these studies, it remains unclear whether the 
gut microbiome can regulate the response of materials-based nano-
vaccines, which have the potential to mount stronger immune re-
sponse than soluble vaccines, even in the absence of adjuvants. It 
also remains unclear whether immunomodulatory nanomaterials 
can overcome any immune regulations imposed by gut microbiome 
and metabolic syndrome.
Here, we first elucidate how TLR5-mediated sensing of the micro-
biota and the associated metabolic syndrome modulates the immune 
response induced by conventional PLGA nanovaccines. We disrupted 
the gut microbiome sensing using TLR5−/− mice and observed that 
the resulting metabolic syndrome diminishes the immune response 
induced by conventional PLGA nanovaccines in the absence of any 
exogenous adjuvant. The PLGA nanovaccines show reduced particle 
trafficking to draining lymphoid tissues, and nanovaccines further 
changed the selective composition of the gut microbiota. By chron-
ically treating WT mice with antibiotics since weaning, we show that 
disrupting gut signaling leads to poor vaccine response in an obesity- 
independent manner. We next engineer an immunomodulatory

pyridine–poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (Pyr-pHEMA), which self- 
assembles with protein antigens to form a nanogel vaccine. The Pyr- 
pHEMA nanogels overcome the diminished response of PLGA vaccines 
in the metabolic syndrome model by modulating the immune response 
in immune cells through TLR2 and mount B cell response higher than 
alum-supplemented PLGA nanovaccines. The results highlight the 
potential of advanced nanomaterials as immunomodulatory vaccines 
under gut-mediated metabolic syndrome conditions.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
PLGA nanovaccines mount limited immunity under  
gut-mediated metabolic syndrome conditions in male mice
To determine the efficacy of PLGA nanovaccines under metabolic 
syndrome conditions, we first validated the pattern of obesity in a dys-
regulated gut microbiome model (TLR5−/− mice) at 10 and 16 weeks 
of age as these encompass the typical age range of in vivo vaccination 
experiments. We confirmed increased fat pad mass and body weight 
among male mice at 16 weeks of age (Fig. 1A and fig. S1), which is 
in congruence with studies by Vijay-Kumar et al. (16). In contrast, 
female mice did not show increased adiposity at these particular ages. 
We confirmed metabolic syndrome in male mice at 16 weeks of age 
with elevated levels of obesity hormone leptin (Fig. 1B), diabetes 
marker insulin (Fig. 1C), and inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 
(IL-6) and IL-8 in the serum of TLR5−/− mice as compared to WT 
mice (Fig. 1D). We did not see a change in systemic tumor necrosis 
factor– (TNF-), IL-1, and IL-10. Unlike previous studies that 
have quantified proinflammatory cytokine levels in adipose tissues of 
TLR5−/− mice (16), we quantified interleukins and TNF- in serum 
because it may have a more direct systemic impact on the vaccine 
response. Previous work has shown that gut dysbiosis can trigger sys-
temic inflammation through elevated levels of serum IL-6 through 
inflammatory cells (18). These studies further showed that chronic 
exposure to inflammation alters the function of phagocytic cells, ren-
dering them less effective at combating pathogens, which forms the 
premise of the current work. Collectively, our characterization of 
mice confirms that TLR5−/− mice developed gut-mediated systemic 
metabolic syndrome at 16 weeks of age, and only male mice showed 
an increase in obese phenotype.
We examined whether altered sensing of the gut microbiome and 
the resulting metabolic syndrome regulate the success of a model 
PLGA nanovaccine, which is among the most widely used nanovac-
cine platforms (1, 19). Mice were immunized subcutaneously either 
with PLGA nanovaccines formulated with 50 g of 4-hydroxy-3- 
nitrophenyl acetyl hapten conjugated to ovalbumin (NP-OVA) or 
as a soluble NP-OVA antigen. The average diameter of the PLGA 
nanovaccine was 194 nm (fig. S2). Previous studies have shown that 
mice immunized with soluble NP-OVA antigen induce NP-specific 
immune response (20); therefore, our experimental design did not 
initially include additional adjuvants to better understand the effi-
cacy of PLGA nanovaccines. Thirty-five days later (1, 21), a booster 
dose was injected, and after another 10 days, cells were harvested 
from the spleen and the draining lymph node (Fig. 1E). Nanovaccines 
induced significantly higher GL7+FAS+CD19+ germinal center B cells 
in the lymph node after immunization as compared to soluble NP-
OVA (Fig. 1E). In contrast, there was no difference in the vaccine 
response between soluble NP-OVA–injected TLR5−/− and nanovaccine- 
injected TLR5−/− mice. Similar observations with germinal center 
response were made 6 days after booster immunization (fig. S3). 
We quantified CD138+ plasma cells in draining lymph nodes and 
observed a trend similar to that of the germinal center response 
(Fig. 1F). The antigen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies 
in the blood serum increased 2.5- to 3.5-fold in WT mice but not in 
TLR5−/− mice, further confirming that only the WT mice gained the 
benefits associated with PLGA vaccination, when compared to the 
soluble antigen (Fig. 1G).
In the WT mice, the PLGA nanovaccines increased the expres-
sion of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) on CD11c+ 
dendritic cells by threefold in the lymph node compared to soluble 
NP-OVA (Fig. 1H). In contrast, there was no difference in the ex-
pression of MHCII marker on dendritic cells in TLR5−/− mice im-
munized with the nanovaccine or soluble antigen. There were no 
significant changes in CD3+ T cells across any group (Fig. 1I). To-
gether, these results highlight that engineered nanovaccines under-
perform in TLR5−/− mice, a model of the altered gut microbiome 
and metabolic syndrome, as compared to age-matched WT mice.
Since female mice do not develop obese phenotype, we hypothe-
sized that the lack of the metabolic syndrome phenotype would lead 
to a similar germinal center response in WT versus TLR5−/− female 
mice. We confirmed the absence of detectable differences in IL-6, IL-8, 
TNF-, IL-1, and IL-10 inflammation in female TLR5−/− and WT 
mice (fig. S1), suggesting the absence of metabolic syndrome based 
on the lack of obesity and an inflammation marker. As expected, both 
WT and TLR5−/− female mice manifested similar germinal center 
B cell response with PLGA nanovaccines (Fig. 1J). Collectively, studies 
in female mice support our hypothesis and suggest that the absence 
of TLR5 alone is not sufficient to modulate vaccine response, impli-
cating aspects of the metabolic syndrome.
TLR5−/− male mice have reduced PLGA nanovaccine 
trafficking to lymphoid tissues
Previous studies have demonstrated that nanovaccine immunity 
often depends on the efficient trafficking of particulate vaccines by 
immune cells to the draining lymph nodes or through direct drainage 
(22–25). Therefore, we hypothesized that the poor immune response 
may correlate to the limited trafficking of nanovaccines in TLR5−/− 
male mice to the draining lymph node as compared to WT mice. To 
test this hypothesis, we subcutaneously injected PLGA nanovaccine 
with a model protein fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) (50 g) into the left flank and analyzed the site 
of injection using an IVIS imager followed by flow cytometry. After 
immunization, TLR5−/− male mice had higher retention of nanovac-
cine at the injection site relative to WT mice, a pattern that continued 
through day 4 and diminished by day 6 (Fig. 2, A and B, and fig. S4). 
We questioned whether the retention of nanovaccine at the injection 
site could limit the localization of nanovaccines in the draining 
lymph node, spleen, and other organs. The draining inguinal lymph 
node of the TLR5−/− mice exhibited a lower accumulation of nano-
vaccines in TLR5−/− mice than in the WT mice on day 2 (Fig. 2, C 
and D), an effect that diminished by day 6. While the liver and kid-
ney showed nanovaccine accumulation on days 2 and 6, there were 
no observed differences between the TLR5−/− and WT mice (fig. 
S4). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that in the draining lymph 
node at day 2, there was a twofold reduction of trafficking of F4/80+ 
macrophages with FITC-PLGA and CD169+ macrophages with 
FITC- 
PLGA+ signal among the TLR5−/− mice relative to the WT 
mice (Fig. 2E). Similarly, we observed a reduced response among 
CD11c+ dendritic cells in TLR5−/− mice (25% FITC-PLGA+CD11c+

twofold elevation of CD19+ B cells and a fourfold increase in the 
percentage of CD3+ T cells were observed at the injection site in 
TLR5−/− mice relative to WT mice (Fig. 2F). Since vaccinated TLR5−/− 
mice do not mount a robust germinal center response (see Fig. 1E) 
or show T cell immunity, we do not think that these recruited cells 
contribute to the vaccine response in the draining lymph node in 
the tested mice. No differences in studied cell populations were seen 
on day 2 at the injection site (fig. S6).
PLGA nanovaccines change the gut microbiota after  
booster dose
To understand which bacteria correlate with vaccine response, we 
characterized the changes in gut microbiome with PLGA nanovac-
cine administration. We performed taxonomic profiling using 16S 
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing (26) of the gut microbiome of 
TLR5−/− and WT mice on stool samples obtained from mice imme-
diately before the booster and 6 days after the booster when the ger-
minal center formation is evident (fig. S3). Overall compositional 
differences between the gut microbiomes of WT and TLR−/− mice 
on the day of the booster were subtle (Fig. 3A). However, after the 
booster, the number of discernable differences between these two 
groups increased (Fig. 3B). After the booster, there was a significant 
increase in Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the TLR5−/− mice than 
WT mice and a concomitant increase in the representation of mem-
bers of the phyla Firmicutes (P < 0.0001) and Tenericutes (P < 0.01) 
in WT mice compared to TLR5−/−.
Since the observed immunological differences between nano-
vaccine response were only observed in male WT versus TLR5−/− 
mice and not corresponding age-matched female mice, we next ex-
amined the compositional differences in the gut microbiome of 
TLR5−/− male versus female mice after booster vaccination. Female 
TLR5−/− mice had more abundance of Actinobacteria (P < 0.001) 
and Firmicutes (P < 0.005) than male TLR5−/− mice after booster 
vaccination (Fig. 3C). Male TLR5−/− mice showed an increase in

Bacteroidetes, Verruco 
microbia, and Proteobacteria. Although in-
creases in the abundance and instability of Proteobacteria are con-
sidered a hallmark of TLR5−/− microbiomes (27), we only observed 
a notable increase in Proteobacteria after the booster in male mice 
(P < 0.0001, one-tailed t test). Further examination would be re-
quired to determine whether these bacteria play a causative role in 
vaccination response. Collectively, these results suggest that differ-
ential vaccine response in male mice may be attributable to distinct 
microbiome composition, in addition to reduced metabolic pheno-
types, and that these features are not observed in female mice at 
16 weeks of age.
Gut microbiome dysbiosis with chronic antibiotics 
decouples the role of obesity and systemic  
inflammation in dysregulated vaccine response
We next sought to decouple whether obesity, as a secondary effect of 
the dysregulated microbiome, was responsible for poor response in 
TLR5−/− mice. To study these phenomena, we fed WT mice with a cock-
tail of antibiotics [ampicillin (1.0 g/liter) and neomycin (0.5 g/liter)] 
in their drinking water, as we have reported earlier (28), starting at 
4 weeks of age (Fig. 4A) and continuing through immunization. 
Unlike TLR5−/− mice, we did not observe an increase in the fat pad 
mass and body weight of antibiotic-treated mice (Fig. 4B). Micro-
biome analysis before immunization at 16 weeks suggested that 
antibiotic-treated WT mice had a significant decrease in Bacteroidetes, 
Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria and an increase in Proteobacteria 
(Fig. 4C). Antibiotic-fed mice were immunized at age 16 weeks ac-
cording to the previously implemented timeline with either NP-OVA 
PLGA nanovaccine or soluble NP-OVA. We analyzed the immune 
response and observed no differences in the germinal center B cell 
(GL7+FAS+CD19+) formation in either the spleen or the draining 
lymph node (Fig. 4D). Other cell populations, except CD11c+ den-
dritic cells, remained largely unchanged (fig. S7). Furthermore, blood 
serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed 
that there were no differences in antigen-specific antibody levels 
(Fig. 4E). Before the booster, the antibiotic-treated mice had elevated 
levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 but not IL-8, IL-10, IL-1, and 
TNF- (Fig. 4F). Drawing from these results, we conclude that the dif-
ferences in the immune response are due to a dysregulation of the in-
testinal microbiome but not obesity. It is possible that elevated levels 
of IL-6 may play a crucial role; however, future studies are warranted 
to decouple the effect of microbiome sensing and IL-6. The antibiotic 
cocktail delivered to these mice did not entirely ablate the bacterial 
microbiota but altered toward an increased Proteobacteria compo-
sition. We, therefore, conclude that simply perturbing the detection 
of the microbiota, which leads to increased inflammation, is suffi-
cient to regulate the PLGA nanovaccine responses.
Pyr-pHEMA nanogel vaccine rescues immune response in 
the male metabolic syndrome mouse model
We hypothesized that a rational combination of antigen and adjuvant 
 
will overcome the poor response imposed by gut or metabolic syn-
drome by stimulating immune cells. We further hypothesized that a 
nanovaccine in which the polymer itself has an adjuvant effect may 
overcome the limitations of dual encapsulation of antigens and adju-
vants in nanovaccines. Previously, we had engineered an immuno-
modulatory nanomaterial where pHEMA was covalently modified 
with pyridine using 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (29). We 
have previously reported that Pyr-pHEMA nanogels are nontoxic 
in mammalian cells with increasing doses of nanogels up to 2.0 mg/ml 
(30). When the modified Pyr-pHEMA polymer was incubated with a pro-
tein antigen of interest, the polymer self-assembled to form a nanogel 
that can activate in vitro cultured dendritic cells and T cells, more than 
a conventional adjuvant (29). However, it remained unclear whether 
the immunomodulatory effect of Pyr-pHEMA originated from the 
polymer itself and whether the Pyr-pHEMA nanogel can overcome 
the limitations faced by PLGA nanovaccines in the TLR5−/− model.
Pyr-pHEMA was synthesized, as reported earlier (29), with a small 
modification to scale up the production to three times than reported 
earlier. Briefly, 1.0 mmol of pHEMA polymer was mixed with nico-
tinoyl chloride hydrochloride (1.2 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) 
and DMAP (Fig. 5A). The resulting purified, concentrated Pyr-pHEMA 
was confirmed by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
spectra acquired in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide)–d6 at 25°C, which 
confirmed that the backbone, linker, and pyridine have experimen-
tally indistinguishable diffusion properties (Fig. 5B). The esterification 
was confirmed by the following peaks: 7.2 to 9.0 for four pyridine-H 
peaks, 4.0 to 4.5 for two OCH2 peaks, 1.5 to 2.0 for CH2, and 0.5 to 
1.0 for ─CH3. The modification of pHEMA with pyridine decreased 
the solubility of pHEMA in water (Fig. 5C), and ultraviolet-visible 
spectroscopy indicated that the absorbance of a pHEMA solution 
was lower than that of Pyr-pHEMA, thus confirming turbidity of the 
solution (Fig. 5D). We believe that the self-assembly of nanogels is 
driven through the displacement of proteins between the aqueous 
water and less water-soluble Pyr-pHEMA at pH 7.4, with minimized 
interfacial energy. The encapsulation efficacy of protein was depen-
dent on the initial protein concentration. We observed up to 0.62 ± 
0.1 mg of FITC-BSA per milligram of Pyr-pHEMA in nanogels en-
gineered using protein concentrations of 280 g/ml, compared to 
0.2 ± 0.1 mg using protein concentrations of 140 g/ml (Fig. 5E). A 
120-hour release study in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) indicated 
40% protein release in 24 hours with nanogels formed using protein 
concentrations of 280 g/ml, as compared to 30% protein release 
using protein concentrations of 140 g/ml (Fig. 5F). The release 
profile saturated after 36 hours at 48 and 38%, respectively. For the 
remainder of the studies, we continued with nanogels formed using 
protein concentrations of 280 g/ml, with an average particle size 
of 190 nm (fig. S2), comparable to the size of PLGA nanovaccines 
studied in Fig. 1.
We immunized male TLR5−/− mice either with Pyr-pHEMA nano-
gels formulated with 50 g of NP-OVA or as a soluble antigen to deter-
mine whether the nanogel would boost the immune response beyond 
the soluble formulation. Ten days after the booster dose, Pyr-pHEMA 
nanogels induced a significant 1.5-fold higher GL7+FAS+CD19+ ger-
minal center B cells in the lymph node as compared to soluble NP-OVA 
(Fig. 5G). This is in contrast with PLGA vaccines (Fig. 1E), suggest-
ing that Pyr-pHEMA can rescue the poor immune response in the 
male TLR5−/− mouse model. Analysis of CD138+ cells unveiled a 
similar trend, and the Pyr-pHEMA response was comparable in 
TLR5−/− and WT mice (Fig. 5H and fig. S8). The antigen-specific 
antibodies in the blood serum confirmed that engineered Pyr-pHEMA 
nanogel rescued the limited immune response shown in PLGA nano-
vaccines as compared to the soluble antigen (Fig. 5I). However, as 
shown in Fig. 5J, there was no difference in the CD11c+ dendritic 
cells in TLR5−/− mice immunized with the Pyr-pHEMA nanovaccine 
or soluble antigen.
In separate Pyr-pHEMA nanogel trafficking studies, flow cytom-
etry analysis revealed that in the draining lymph node at day 2, there

was a 2.5-fold increase in trafficking of CD169+ macrophages with 
FITC-OVA+ Pyr-pHEMA nanogels (Fig. 5K). The trafficked macro-
phages showed significantly higher MHCII expression in mice im-
munized with FITC-OVA–loaded Pyr-pHEMA nanogel than soluble 
FITC-OVA antigen. Although we did not see a difference in percent 
CD11c+ dendritic cells between Pyr-pHEMA nanogels and soluble 
antigen (fig. S8), the expression of MHCII marker on CD11c+ den-
dritic cells (Fig. 5L) was similar to that on the CD169+ macrophages. 
In addition, we observed that the Pyr-pHEMA nanogels did not ac-
cumulate differentially in the kidney or liver (fig. S9). Collectively, 
these results led us to conclude that Pyr-pHEMA nanogels can induce 
an increased immune response in TLR5−/− mice with dysregulated 
gut sensing and associated metabolic syndrome. Last, in separate 
immunization studies, we directly compared the germinal center 
B cell response in PLGA nanovaccine alone, PLGA nanovaccine with 
gold-standard adjuvant alum, and Pyr-pHEMA nanogel. As indi-
cated in Fig. 5M, addition of alum to PLGA nanovaccines rescued the 
B cell response in TLR5−/− mice to the level of WT mice immunized 
with PLGA nanovaccines alone. In contrast, Pyr-pHEMA nanogels 
without any exogenous adjuvant induced higher (P < 0.001) germinal 
center response in TLR5−/− mice as compared to alum-supplemented 
PLGA nanovaccines. Therefore, Pyr-pHEMA nanogels offer an im-
munomodulatory effect without the combinatorial delivery of adju-
vant molecules.
Pyr-pHEMA nanogel immunogenicity is mediated by TLR2 
on immune cells
It is well established that materials or biologics that mimic bacterial 
pathogen-associated molecular patterns are capable of stimulating 
TLRs on the surface of immune cells. In a competing theory by Seong 
and Matzinger (31), hydrophobic portions of biological molecules 
and potentially materials can act as universal damage-associated mo-
lecular patterns to initiate an immune response, in particular through 
TLR2 and TLR4 (32–35). New studies have shown that select small- 
molecule compounds that are aromatic in nature and structurally 
un 
related to any known TLR2 agonists can function as TLR2 ago-
nists (33). Since Pyr-pHEMA has hydrophobic pyridine attached to 
pHEMA and pyridine is an aromatic compound, we next investigated 
whether Pyr-pHEMA nanogel would stimulate immune cells either 
through TLR2 or TLR4 or, alternatively, through TLR5 or TLR9. We 
transfected TLR2, TLR4, or TLR9 into human embryonic kidney 
(HEK) 293 cells (that endogenously express TLR5) and exposed the 
cells to Pyr-pHEMA nanogels carrying NP-OVA antigen (20 g/ml), 
antigen alone (20 g/ml), or media. Pyr-pHEMA nanogels stimulated 
TLR2 signal, as indicated by high relative light units of luciferase 
(Fig. 6A), but had minimal effect on TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9, similar 
to antigen alone and media. These results suggest that Pyr-pHEMA 
nanogels function through TLR2 (Fig. 6B) and that the stimulation 
is driven by polymer and not the complexed protein. We tested this 
hypothesis by comparing immune response in TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, and 
WT mice. Previous studies (36) have shown that the small intestinal 
TLR5 expression is not regulated through TLR2 or TLR4, as shown 
by unchanged levels of small intestinal TLR5 transcript in small in-
testinal tissues of TLR2−/− and TLR4−/− mice. These studies further 
showed that TLR5−/− mice did not affect TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA levels. 
Therefore, we do not expect TLR5 to be influenced in TLR2 and TLR4 
mice. We first exposed bone marrow–derived primary dendritic cells 
from TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, and WT mice to the nanogel formulation 
(20 g/ml). We observed that the MHCII and CD80 expression on 
nanogel-incubated cells was significantly reduced in cells derived 
from TLR2−/− mice but not in TLR4−/− and WT mice (Fig. 6C). To 
further validate our hypothesis, we immunized TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, 
and WT mice with NP-OVA as a soluble antigen or formulated with 
Pyr-pHEMA nanogel. We observed that while both WT and TLR4−/−- 
deficient mice had significantly elevated GL7+FAS+CD19+ germinal 
center B cell population relative to their soluble counterparts, TLR2−/−- 
deficient mice did not experience any increase in humoral immunity 
relative to the soluble antigen (Fig. 6D and fig. 10). These results ex-
plain that in vivo humoral immunity is regulated by Pyr-pHEMA 
nanogel and, more specifically, through TLR2 interactions. Whether 
hydrophobicity and aromaticity are truly the drivers of Pyr-pHEMA 
response will be the subject of future investigations.
CONCLUSION
While recent work links intestinal microbiome to immunity and sol-
uble antigens (17, 37–39), we demonstrate how the gut microbiome 
and the resulting metabolic syndrome modulate humoral immunity 
against biomaterials-based nanovaccines. Collective analyses of male 
TLR5−/− mice and antibiotic-treated mice provide early indications that 
gut microbiome–mediated inflammation, and perhaps not obesity, 
could be the driver of poor PLGA nanovaccine response. The impact 
of obesity could be further disentangled from that of the microbiota 
using obese animal models or alternative models, such as fecal trans-
fer experiments and cohabitation studies, and will be investigated in 
the future. We chose TLR5−/− mice because this model has been linked 
to both metabolic syndrome and vaccine responses (16, 17, 40). The 
symptoms developed by TLR5−/− mice are milder than those devel-
oped by ob/ob obese mice. Gut inflammation in the TLR5−/− mice is 
caused directly by microbiota, and other traits of the TLR5−/− pheno-
type are downstream of increased gut inflammation (16, 41, 42). 
Pulendran and colleagues showed that antiviral vaccine itself does 
not directly signal through TLR5 but rather that the intestinal micro-
biota contribute to TLR5-mediated enhancement of immunity to 
soluble human influenza vaccine and to the inactivated polio vaccine 
(17). Several human influenza vaccine formulations in clinical trial 
have used flagellin as an adjuvant for TLR5 signaling [e.g., VAX102 
(M2e-flagellin) universal influenza vaccine; ClinicalTrials.gov iden-
tifier: NCT00921947]. Future studies will investigate the effect in 
other metabolic syndrome mouse models. The studies reported here 
are at 16 weeks of age when male mice manifest metabolic syndrome 
phenotype. Although female mice do not manifest metabolic syndrome 
phenotype at 16 weeks of age, future investigation in aged mice is 
needed to confirm that it is a gender-specific phenomenon. In the 
current study, we engineered a TLR2 stimulating Pyr-pHEMA 
nanogels, which modulated the immunity in a gut microbiome–
mediated metabolic syndrome mouse model. The causative effects 
of nanoparticle- 
microbiome changes with respect to PLGA and the 
interaction of Pyr- 
pHEMA with gut microbiome will be evaluated 
in future studies. The nano-dimension can span a broad length scale, 
and the response demonstrated may be different with particles that 
are different in size from those studied here. Therefore, further 
studies are needed to elucidate the role of various nanoparticle sizes 
and material characteristics. We anticipate that these studies may 
further pave the path to discover how modulations to gut micro-
biome coupled with immunomodulatory vaccines could improve re-
sponses in patients with metabolic syndrome. We also anticipate that 
these results will lay the foundation for future work in infectious

metabolic syndrome (43, 44) and predict how metabolic diseases, 
gut pathologies, and other inflammatory conditions may affect 
nanovaccine response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
TLR5−/− mouse phenotype characterization
All mice were characterized by weighing the whole mouse at the time 
of euthanasia, followed by determining the weight of the epididymal 
fat pads. Blood was collected at euthanasia to quantify the systemic 
inflammation. Blood serum was stored at −80°C and analyzed at the 
Duke Molecular Physiology Institute Biomarkers Shared Resource. 
Serum was assayed using a custom Proinflammatory Panel (Meso 
Scale Diagnostics) measuring IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF- 
and a Mouse Metabolic Kit (Meso Scale Diagnostics; Rockville, MD). 
All animal studies were performed in compliance with the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Cornell University.
Mouse immunizations
Mice were immunized either subcutaneously or intraperitoneally 
with 50 g of NP-OVA encapsulated into PLGA or complexed to 
Pyr-pHEMA, a dose-matched soluble formulation (50 g/ml), or PBS. 
PLGA particles were synthesized using Resomer RG 503 H (Sigma- 
Aldrich; molecular weight, 24,000 to 38,000) with polyvinyl alcohol 
(Sigma-Aldrich; 2% w/v; molecular weight, 40,000 to 70,000; 80 to 
90% hydrolyzed) using previously published protocols (45). The re-
lease profile of biologics from PLGA has been reported earlier by us 
(19) and shows an initial burst release followed by sustained release 
phase and a next phase of release observed around day 20. At indicated 
timelines in figures, a booster injection was applied. Blood was col-
lected via the submandibular vein from the mice, and antigen-specific

antibodies were quantified with ELISA. After either 6 or 10 days, 
animal organs were harvested and lymphoid tissue was prepared for 
flow cytometry. For Pyr-pHEMA, TLR5−/− mice were intraperitone-
ally immunized either with nanovaccines formulated with 50 g of 
NP-OVA or as a soluble antigen to determine whether the nanogel 
would boost the response beyond the soluble formulation. Previous 
work has shown that subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intraperito-
neal injections all elicit a strong immune response in engineered 
vaccines; however, intraperitoneal vaccination has a shorter timeline 
for induction of immune response (46, 47). Two weeks later, a booster 
dose was injected, and after another 10 days, cells were harvested 
from the draining lymph node. Similar studies were performed with 
TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, and WT mice with matched age and gender. PLGA 
nanovaccines with adjuvant Imject Alum (Thermo Scientific), which 
contains an aqueous solution of aluminum hydroxide (40 mg/ml) 
and magnesium hydroxide (40 mg/ml) plus inactive stabilizers, were 
prepared as per the manufacturer’s recommendation. Briefly, Imject 
Alum was added dropwise with constant mixing to the NP-OVA 
so that the final volume ratio of Imject Alum to immunogen was 
1:1 and then encapsulated inside PLGA nanovaccine and injected 
intraperitoneally into mice. PLGA nanovaccine without adjuvant 
and Pyr-pHEMA nanogel were used as comparative groups in the 
adjuvant study and were injected intraperitoneally. All animal studies 
were performed in compliance with the IACUC at Cornell University. 
The following antibodies or their fluorophore variations were used in 
this study: Peridinin Chlorophyll Protein Complex (PerCP) PerCP- 
eFluor 710–anti-CD3 (17A2), PerCP-Cyanine5.5–anti-CD8 (53-6.7), 
Phycoerythrin (PE)–Cyanine7–anti-CD11c (N418), eFluor 660–anti- 
CD169 (SER-4), and PE–anti-F4/80 (BM8) from eBioscience; PE–
anti-MHCII (M5/114.15.2) and PE–anti-CD138 (300506) from 
Invitrogen; and Allophycocyanin (APC)–anti-CD19 (1D3), FITC–
anti-GL7 (GL7), and PE–anti-CD95 (Jo2) from BD Pharmingen.
Microbiome analysis
DNA was isolated from mouse fecal pellets using the MO BIO 
PowerSoil DNA Isolation Magnetic Kit with the recommended 
proteinase K step to assist in cell lysis for gut microbiome samples. 
16S rRNA libraries were prepared using the Earth Microbiome Project 
protocol with primers as described by Walters et al. (48). Libraries 
were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform, and each sample 
had over 10,000 paired-end 150 ×150 base pair (bp) reads. Sequences 
were analyzed using mothur (49). Paired sequences were stitched 
together, and those with ambiguous nucleotides or those longer than 
275 bp were removed. Chimeras were identified using UCHIME 
(50) and removed. Stitched reads were aligned to the SILVA rRNA 
database v.128 (51) and clustered at 97% sequence identity, and 16S 
rRNA sequences were assigned taxonomies using the Ribosomal 
Database Project naïve Bayesian classifier with a confidence thresh-
old value of 80% (52).
Chemical synthesis of Pyr-pHEMA using DMAP
Some of the following methods are similar to those previously pub-
lished (29). Pyr-pHEMA synthesis was performed through the es-
terification of the hydroxyl group on pHEMA. Briefly, pHEMA 
(molecular weight, 20,000 Da; 150 mg, 1.2 mmol OH residues) was 
dispersed in anhydrous THF (Sigma-Aldrich; 5 ml) at room tem-
perature. DMAP (Sigma-Aldrich; 451 mg; 3.6 mmol) was added, and 
the mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature until the solution 
became homogeneous. Nicotinoyl chloride hydrochloride (Alfa Aesar; 
411 mg; 2.3 mmol) was dispersed in THF and added dropwise to the 
pHEMA solution mixture under inert nitrogen atmosphere. The es-
terification was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 48 hours. 
A precipitate appeared within 24 hours and was separated from the 
liquid by centrifugation at the end of the reaction. The precipitate was 
further washed with THF, and the supernatant was combined and 
precipitated in cold diethyl ether. The final solid precipitate was rinsed 
thoroughly with ether three times to remove excess DMAP. Last, the 
precipitate was collected and dried under vacuum for 3 days at room 
temperature. 1H and two-dimensional NMR spectra were acquired 
in DMSO-d6 at 25°C on a 600-MHz Varian Unity INOVA spectrom-
eter operating at 599.50 and 150.76 MHz for 1H observation and 13C 
decoupling, respectively, using a 5-mm, inverse, triple-resonance 
probe head. 1D 13C spectrum was acquired in DMSO-d6 at 25°C on a 
500-MHz Varian Unity INOVA spectrometer operating at 125.68 MHz 
for 13C observation, using a 5-mm, direct observe, dual probe head. 
Spectra were processed and analyzed in MNova 12.0.2 (Mestrelab 
Research S.L., Santiago de Compostela, Spain). Diffusion-ordered NMR 
dataset was acquired with the double, bipolar pulse stimulated echo 
sequence, as supplied in the DOSY package of VnmrJ 3.2 (Dbppste_cc), 
with 80-ms diffusion delay and 4.4-ms bipolar diffusion gradient 
pulses.
Fabrication of Pyr-pHEMA self-assembly nanogel
Some of the following methods are similar to those previously pub-
lished (29). Nanogels were formed by dropwise addition of 0.2 ml 
of Pyr-pHEMA (2 mg/ml in dimethylformamide) into a 5-ml solu-
tion of a protein as a model antigen (NP-OVA and FITC-BSA) in 
PBS under stirring at 900 rpm at room temperature. The resulting 
product was separated from unreacted components by centrifugation 
at 20,000g and washed three times. Characterization of size was per-
formed using Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments). We determined 
the protein loading efficiency using FITC-BSA nanogels and a BioTek 
Synergy H1 plate reader (488-nm excitation and 525-nm emission). 
Protein amount was quantified using a standard curve [FITC-BSA (0 
to 60 g/ml)]. FITC-BSA nanogels were prepared using stock protein 
solution concentrations of 60,120 and 240 g/ml with 0.2 ml of 
Pyr-pHEMA polymer (2 mg/ml). Samples were centrifuged three 
times and thoroughly washed. To quantify release rate, nanogels were 
placed in a 96-well plate at a known protein polymer concentration. 
Every 24 hours, several wells were removed and placed into Eppendorf 
tubes. These were spun down at 20,000g to separate nanogels from 
soluble protein, and the fluorescence of the protein nanogels was 
quantified, as previously discussed. For further studies, nanogels for-
mulated with a protein concentration of 280 g/ml were used as their 
diameters most closely matched comparable PLGA nanoparticles.
TLR luciferase assay
The quantification of TLR activity was performed as previously de-
scribed (53). Briefly, HEK293 cells (2 × 104) were transiently trans-
fected in 96-well plates using TransIT (Mirus) with TLR4-encoding 
plasmids, 5× nuclear factor B–luciferase, and empty vector equal to 
200 ng per well of total DNA. After overnight culture, the cells were 
treated with Pyr-pHEMA nanogels with antigen (20 g/ml), antigen 
alone (20 g/ml), and media for 18 hours. Assay validation was per-
formed using Pam3Cysk (1 g/ml) (TLR2), lipopolysaccharide 
(100 ng/ml) (TLR4), flagellin (100 ng/ml) (TLR5), or CpG DNA 
(1 g/ml) (TLR9) for 18 hours. Cell lysates (5× reporter lysis buffer; 
Promega) were assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase

In vitro nanogel response in TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, and WT mice
Bone marrow monocytes were isolated from TLR2−/−, TLR4−/−, and 
WT mice. Mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. All subse-
quent steps were performed in a laminar flow hood. The femur was 
carefully removed from the muscle and washed thoroughly with 
ethanol to sterilize their exteriors. Either side of the femur was cut 
with dissection scissors, and bone marrow was flushed into sterile 
Eppendorf tubes with PBS. Immature bone marrow cells were spun 
down at 300g and lysed in red blood cell lysis buffer. To differentiate 
the bone marrow cells into dendritic cells, they were cultured in 
RPMI medium at a seeding density of 5 × 104 cells per well. RPMI 
was supplemented with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor (GM-CSF) (20 ng/ml) and placed in an incubator at 37°C and 
5% CO2. After 3 days, an additional volume of RPMI with GM-CSF 
(20 ng/ml) was added. After 6 days, media were replaced with RPMI 
supplemented with GM-CSF (20 ng/ml) and nanogels (20 g/ml) 
were added. Cells were kept in culture for 48 hours, and cell surface 
marker expression levels were quantified by flow cytometry.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed with three or more replicates as de-
tailed in the figure legends. Immunization and trafficking experiments 
were repeated at least two times. Statistical analysis was performed 
as detailed in the figure legends and text. All gut microbiome analysis 
used one-tailed t test, whereas other data analysis used an unpaired 
two-tailed t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
Tukey’s post hoc test or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s correc-
tion. Quantitative analyses as scatter or bar graphs are presented as 
means ± SEM. Microbiome results are presented as cladograms. In 
all studies, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 unless otherwise 
stated. Nonsignificance is denoted by “ns.”
