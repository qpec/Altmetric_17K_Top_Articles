IMPORTANCE The Institute of Medicine and The Joint Commission recommend routine
documentation of patients’ sexual orientation in health care settings. Currently, very few
health care systems collect these data since patient preferences and health care
professionals’ support regarding collection of data about patient sexual orientation are
unknown.
OBJECTIVE To identify the optimal patient-centered approach to collect sexual orientation
data in the emergency department (ED) in the Emergency Department Query for
Patient-Centered Approaches to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity study.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An exploratory, sequential, mixed-methods design was
used first to evaluate qualitative interviews conducted in the Baltimore, Maryland, and
Washington, DC, areas. Fifty-three patients and 26 health care professionals participated in
the qualitative interviews. Interviews were followed by a national online survey, in which 1516
(potential) patients (244 lesbian, 289 gay, 179 bisexual, and 804 straight) and 429 ED health
care professionals (209 physicians and 220 nurses) participated. Survey participants were
recruited using random digit dialing and address-based sampling techniques.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Qualitative interviews were used to obtain the perspectives
of patients and health care professionals on sexual orientation data collection, and a
quantitative survey was used to gauge patients' and health care professionals' willingness to
provide or obtain sexual orientation information.
RESULTS Mean (SD) age of patient and clinician participants was 49 (16.4) and 51 (9.4) years,
respectively. Qualitative interviews suggested that patients were less likely to refuse to
provide sexual orientation than providers expected. Nationally, 154 patients (10.3%) reported
that they would refuse to provide sexual orientation; however, 333 (77.8%) of all clinicians
thought patients would refuse to provide sexual orientation. After adjustment for
demographic characteristics, only bisexual patients had increased odds of refusing to provide
sexual orientation compared with heterosexual patients (odds ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.26-4.56).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients and health care professionals have discordant views
on routine collection of data on sexual orientation. A minority of patients would refuse to
provide sexual orientation. Implementation of a standardized, patient-centered approach for
routine collection of sexual orientation data is required on a national scale to help to identify
and address health disparities among lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations.

services3,4 compared with heterosexual populations.
Approximately 8 million Americans identify as LGB,5 and, al-
though some inequities have been identified, lack of data on
sexual orientation is a major challenge to understanding and
addressing LGB health disparities.6 To address this issue, LGB
individualshavebeenidentifiedasatargetgroupforhealthim-
provement by Healthy People 2020,7 and the US Department
of Health and Human Services and the Institutes of Medicine
now recommend routine collection of sexual orientation data
in federally funded population health surveys and in elec-
tronic health records.7,8 In response, the National Health Inter-
view Survey began collecting sexual orientation data in 2013.9
Obtaining data through population surveys is important
for identifying and addressing health disparities; in addition,
collecting data in a patient’
s electronic health record (EHR)
can help clinicians to provide more complete care.10,11 Re-
cently, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released
MeaningfulUseStage3guidelinesthatrequireallcertifiedEHR
systems to have the capacity to record sexual orientation
data,12 but very few health systems or hospitals report rou-
tinely collecting such data.11 Emergency departments (EDs) are
the source of nearly half of inpatient admissions in the United
States and the primary point of entry for uninsured and
underinsured patients.13 However, few hospital EDs rou-
tinely collect sexual orientation information,11 and there are
currently no evidence-based methods standards to collect
these data in a patient-centered manner. Despite the impor-
tance of sexual orientation collection for providing high-
quality, patient-centered care and the opportunity to collect
a large volume of sexual orientation information for LGB dis-
parities research, routine collection of data on sexual orien-
tation in the ED setting is rare, and optimal patient-centered
approaches for collecting this information remain unclear.
There is little known about the effect of sexual orienta-
tion data collection on patient outcomes; yet, given the im-
portanceofsexualorientationtopopulationhealth7-9andclini-
cal care,14-17 the objectives of this study were (1) to understand
the willingness to disclose sexual orientation among patients
andwillingnesstocollectsexualorientationdataamonghealth
care professionals and (2) to identify the optimal patient-
centered approach to collecting sexual orientation demo-
graphic data in the ED. Every year in the United States, there
are more than 130 million ED visits,18 so the potential impact
of routinely collecting sexual orientation information in that
setting is great given the high volume of patients.
Methods
Overall Study Design
The Emergency Department Query for Patient-Centered Ap-
proachestoSexualOrientationandGenderIdentity(EQUALITY)
study used an exploratory, sequential, mixed-methods de-
sign. In the qualitative first phase, in-depth interviews were
conducted with a large sample of patients and ED profession-
alsintheBaltimore,Maryland,andWashington,DC,areas.The
results from the qualitative phase informed the development
of the quantitative second phase of the study, in which a com-
prehensivenationalsurveyofpatientsandEDprofessionalswas
conducted. A stakeholder advisory board (SAB) consisting of
nurses, physicians, researchers, and patients, as well as direc-
torsofsomeofthemostinfluentialnationalandlocalLGBT(les-
bian, gay, bisexual, transgender) advocacy organizations pro-
vided feedback and guidance in each phase of the study. Given
thehighlynuancedconsiderationssurroundinginterviewsand
surveying transgender individuals, the SAB agreed that a sepa-
rate specialized national survey be devoted to this group, with
the results reported in a separate article. The SAB members are
listed at the end of this article, and selected minutes from SAB
meetings can be found in the eAppendix in the Supplement. A
visual representation of the study design is found in eFigure 1
intheSupplement,andfurtherdetailsareavailable.19Thisstudy
wasapprovedbytheJohnsHopkinsandPartnersHealthcareIn-
stitutional Review Boards. Written informed consent was ob-
tained prior to beginning the interviews, and interview partici-
pants received a $35 gift card. The survey participants received
$10 for completing the survey.
Interview Participants
A purposive sample of participants was recruited for semi-
structured, in-depth, 1-on-1 interviews. Patient participants
were defined as community members with experience seek-
ingemergencymedicalcare;theywererecruitedthroughcom-
munity outreach, flyers, and social media. Organizations at
which active patient recruitment occurred included Equality
Maryland,JohnsHopkinsLighthouse,BeSure,B’
moreOutloud,
Sistas of the “T,
” and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender
Community Center of Baltimore. Patients could express inter-
est in participation through the study website19 or via a tele-
phone hotline established for recruitment purposes. Some pa-
tients also heard about the study through friends or SAB
members. Individuals 18 years or older were eligible for study
inclusion. Recruitment was designed to ensure approxi-
mately equal participation of people who identified as les-
bian, gay, bisexual, or heterosexual, with variation in age and
race/ethnicity within each stratum and an a priori goal of 10
patients per group. Qualitative data analysis occurred simul-
taneously with interviews, allowing researchers to continue
Key Points
Question How do views about collection of sexual orientation
information in the emergency department compare among
patients and health care professionals?
Findings In this exploratory, sequential, mixed-methods study of
patients and health care professionals, 10.3% of patients reported
they would refuse to provide sexual orientation information in the
emergency department, whereas 77.8% of health care
professionals thought patients would refuse to provide such
information when asked in this setting.
Meaning Few patients will refuse to provide sexual orientation
information in the emergency department setting in contrast to
what most emergency department health care professionals think.

 recruiting patients until no new themes emerged. Final en-
rollment was determined by achievement of thematic satura-
tion. Further details regarding patient and clinician recruit-
ment can be found in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
In this qualitative phase, ED professional participants, in-
cluding physicians, nurses, and advanced practice clinicians,
wererecruitedfrom3communityand2academicmedicalcen-
ters in the northeastern United States. Interview recruitment
was designed to ensure that a variety of staff roles within the
ED setting were included, as well as diversity across age and
race/ethnicity. Interviews for patients and clinicians were con-
ducted until the point of thematic saturation was reached.
Qualitative Data Collection
Semistructured interview guides were developed a priori and
were pilot tested with LGB and straight individuals as well as
health care professionals. Interview guides were revised af-
ter piloting and throughout the interview process to ensure
effective exploration of emergent themes. Interview guides
focused on experiences with sexual orientation collection in
the ED, barriers and facilitators to sexual orientation collec-
tion in the ED, and preferred means of sexual orientation col-
lection in the ED. All gender identity data collected from in-
terview participants were collected via the 2-step method.20
Qualitative interviews took place between August 6, 2014,
and January 28, 2015. All interviews were conducted in per-
son by 1 of 2 researchers (L.M.K. and R.Y.S.) in a private loca-
tion, and all interviews were audiorecorded. Interviews lasted
between 30 minutes and 2 hours, with most interviews last-
ing approximately 1 hour. Audio data were deidentified and
transcribed verbatim prior to analysis.
Qualitative Data Analysis
Interview data were independently coded by 2 researchers
(L.M.K.andR.Y.S.)usingtheconstantcomparativemethod.21An
iterative coding process was utilized to identify themes. Tran-
scribedinterviewswereenteredintoAtlas.TIforanalysis.22The
research team met regularly to discuss any differences in data
analysisandensureconsistency.Themesidentifiedintheinter-
views were used to develop questions for the national survey.
Survey Participants
To obtain a nationally representative sample, an interna-
tional market research firm was contracted to conduct na-
tional surveys of patients and health care professionals.
Patient survey participants were recruited through GfK’
s
KnowledgePanel, and provider survey participants were re-
cruited through GfK’
s Physician Consulting Network. The GfK
Knowledge Panel is the largest probability-based survey panel
in the United States and has been used for research ranging
from climate change23 to vaccinations.24,25 GfK recruits mem-
bers for its KnowledgePanel using random digit dialing and
address-based sampling techniques to ensure inclusion of
households with landlines, cell phone–only households, and
households with and without internet access.26 After recruit-
ment, GfK provides households without internet access a com-
puter and internet access to be able to participate in surveys.
Participants were eligible if they were 18 years or older, lived
in the United States, and consented to participate in the on-
line survey. For the health care professional survey, only phy-
sicians and nurses who worked in the ED were eligible to par-
ticipate. Surveys took place between March and April 2015.
Survey Content
Survey content solicited information on the importance of
sexual orientation collection, barriers, facilitators, risks and
benefitstosexualorientationcollection,willingnesstodisclose/
collect sexual orientation information, and preferred meth-
ods to disclose/collect sexual orientation information. Sur-
vey items were multiple choice, Likert scale, or open-ended.
SAB provided guidance on survey item inclusion and word-
ing. All survey items were pilot tested prior to quantitative data
collection. The final surveys had 53 questions (patients) and
45 questions (professionals).
Survey content also included questions on the impor-
tance of gender identity collection, barriers, facilitators, risks,
and benefits as both sexual orientation and gender identity
would be routinely collected in the clinical setting. However,
due to the nuances of collecting gender identity and feed-
back from our SAB, these data will be reported separately.
Quantitative Data Analysis
Likert scale survey questions were grouped into 3 categories:
agree/strongly agree, neutral, and disagree/strongly dis-
agree. Descriptive statistics of survey items were calculated.
To understand the differences among patients who would
refuse to report SO, participants were grouped into 2 categories
according to responses to the question, “I would refuse to pro-
videSO.
”Patientparticipantswhoagreedorstronglyagreedwere
categorizedasrefuse,andpatientparticipantswhowereneutral,
disagreed, or strongly disagreed were categorized as would not
refuse. Demographic characteristics of patients who would re-
fuse vs not refuse to provide sexual orientation information in
theEDwereweightedtobeproportionallyrepresentativeatthe

Theoddsofrefusingtoprovidesexualorientationwerecal-

were sex, SO, age, educational level, race, marital status, rental
status, head of household, work status, and income. All data
analyses were completed using Stata, version 13,27 including
the survey suite of commands. All tests were 2-sided, and a
P value <.05 was considered significant.

 participants. Among patient participants, 9 lesbian, 12 gay, 12
bisexual, 2 queer, 14 heterosexual, and 4 patients who iden-
tified as “other” participated in the interviews, thus achiev-
ingrecruitmentgoalsforadiverserepresentationofSO.Allpar-
ticipants who identified as lesbian identified as female, and
all participants who identified as gay identified as male. All cli-
nician participants identified as straight. Of patient partici-
pants,45%identifiedasblack/AfricanAmerican,43%aswhite/
Caucasian, 9% as Asian, and 8% as Hispanic. Most clinician
participants identified as white/Caucasian. Full demo-
graphic data are found in Table 1.
Medical relevance, normalization, and recognition
emerged as themes when discussing routine collection of
sexual orientation in the ED (Table 2). Although clinicians rec-
ognized the importance of disclosure of sexual orientation
when medically relevant, most patients believed that sexual
orientation was always relevant to the ED health care encoun-
ter. Many patients stated that sexual orientation was some-
thing their health care professional needed to know, and they
were willing to provide these data when asked. For example,
a bisexual man commented, “[Sexual orientation], like what I
eatandhowIexerciseandstuff...playsahugepartofyouknow,
treating me.
” A heterosexual man explained, “You’
ve got to ask
the questions to everyone because you don’
t know them.”
Lesbian, gay, and bisexual patients recognized the impor-
tance of collection of sexual orientation not only for their in-
dividual encounters in the ED but also for the societal ben-
efits of recognition and normalization of LGB minorities. Many
patients recognized that routine collection of sexual orienta-
tion as demographic information facilitates normalization and
recognition. A queer female explained what routine collec-
tion of sexual orientation suggests: “If you are counted, if you
are visible, it is sort of another form of recognition at an insti-
tutional level.” A gay male echoed the need for institutional
and societal recognition: “If the question becomes standard
and I think everybody is pushing for those questions to be-
come standard because there are all sorts of things we don’
t
know about the community—the more those questions be-
come standard, the less people will be surprised by them.”
Conversely, clinicians valued treating all patients the same
and thus often described not needing to know their patients’
SO. One ED nurse explained, “If it affected their medical treat-
ment or if it was related to their reason they came to the ED,
then I think that was necessary to ask...but if they come here
for a cold or if they come here for a laceration...it’
s none of my
business.
” Similarly, an ED physician assistant stated, “If they
come in with a broken toe, then I don’
t need to know that
they’
re a lesbian.” These interviews suggest that, although
patients recognize the need for collection of SO, some physi-
cians and nurses may not.
The quantitative patient survey response rate was 70.1%,
and the clinician survey response rate was 86.2%. Mean (SD)
age of patient and clinician participants was 49 (16.4) and 51
(9.4) years, respectively. Additional demographic data for
patients and clinicians are found in Table 3. Results from the
national survey confirmed the generalizability of the qualita-
tive findings to the national level.
Data on willingness to provide sexual orientation when
routinely collected in the ED are presented in Table 4. Pa-
tients and clinicians would be willing to provide or collect
sexual orientation if assured of confidentiality (52.1% and
87.0%, respectively) or a private space (84.2% and 88.2%, re-
spectively). Similarly, if sexual orientation is documented the
same as other demographic questions (eg, race and educa-
tion), 749 patients (49.4%) and 275 clinicians (64.1%) would
be willing to provide or collect the data. When asked whether
they would be offended if sexual orientation data were rou-
tinely collected in the ED, 159 (10.7%) of all patients agreed.
In contrast, 342 clinicians (79.8%) thought that patients would
be offended if asked their sexual orientation in the ED. Simi-
larly, 333 clinicians (77.8%) thought that patients would refuse

 to provide their sexual orientation in the ED; however, only
154 (10.3%) of all patients reported they would refuse to pro-
vide such information during an ED health care encounter.
In population-weighted results, 143 (10.1%) straight, 1
(4.8%), lesbian, 3 (12.0%) gay, and 5 (16.4%) bisexual patients
would refuse to provide sexual orientation in the ED (Table 5);
in examining between-group variation in refusal, significant
differences were found between straight and bisexual indi-
viduals (χ2 = 5.82; P = .04), gay and lesbian individuals
(χ2 = 8.72; P = .02), and lesbian and bisexual individuals
(χ2 = 16.5; P < .001). No significant differences were found for
refusal to provide sexual orientation by age, race, educa-
tional level, or marital status. In unadjusted logistic regres-
sion, bisexual patients had 1.73 times the odds of refusing to
provide sexual orientation compared with straight patients
(95% CI, 1.01-2.98; P = .048). Patients aged 60 years or older
had 2.19 greater odds of refusing to provide sexual orienta-
tion information (95% CI, 1.04-4.62; P = .04). After adjust-
ment for other demographic characteristics, only bisexual pa-
tientscontinuedtohavesignificantlyincreasedoddsofrefusing
to provide sexual orientation compared with straight pa-
tients (odds ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.26-4.56; P = .008).
Both patients and clinicians indicated nonverbal self-
report as their preferred method of sexual orientation infor-
mation collection (eTable 2 in the Supplement). This prefer-
ence was supported by the qualitative interviews, in which
patients identified normalization and recognition as major fa-
cilitators of sexual orientation data collection.
Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate that most Americans are
willing to disclose sexual orientation in the ED setting. The na-
tionally representative survey data are supported by in-
depth qualitative interviews, which suggest discordance be-
tween patient and health care professional views on routine
collection of SO; although most clinicians believe that pa-
tientswillrefusetoprovidesexualorientationinformation,few
patients reported that they would refuse to provide such in-
formation. Routine collection of sexual orientation data from
all patients signals normalization of LGB minorities within so-
ciety, and both patients and clinicians identify nonverbal self-
report as the preferred method of collection.
Routine collection of sexual orientation information in the
health care setting contributes to normalization of LGB indi-
viduals within society28; Healthy People 2010 laid out com-
prehensive recommendations to support health care, educa-
tion and training, policy and advocacy, and research targeting
LGB populations in multiple sectors, including health care and

Medical relevance
Bisexual man, age 59 y: “It’
s best to know all about it…for us
to be on good terms…it’
s good for [the doctor] to ask that
though. I like that.”
Bisexual man, age 30 y: “It was in the same category as if they
asked me does your family have a history of heart disease…or do
you have diabetes? It was kind of like just a routine question, and
I think that’
s what helped was the fact that they integrated it into
the routine.”
Heterosexual woman, age 22 y: “I think that [sexual orientation]
would be important for the doctor to know just because you’
re
more susceptible to some diseases and the doctor has to know
all that.”
Nurse, age 46 y: “I don’
t think sexual orientation should have any
or does have any play in it.”
Physician assistant, age 37 y: “When you’
re talking about their
race and all that, that’
s something that typically is collected,
but I think getting more personal, into their sexual
orientation…that’
s maybe a little too invasive just to collect
on everybody.”
Physician, age 36 y: “I ask because I feel it’
s clinically relevant
for care. I don’
t say ask all my patients. Because I don’
t, and
I don’
t think it’
s always important to know.”
Recognition
Gay man, age 26 y: “[Clinicians] understood more or less where
I’
m coming from or have an ability to relate and discuss [sexual
orientation] in a professional manner.”
Bisexual woman, age 50 y: “You cannot put everybody in…this
one category.”
Queer woman, age 47 y: “When you struggle with invisibility,
you look for a sign of yourself anywhere, absolutely anywhere.”
Bisexual woman, age 23 y: “I think it is just something that is
so important to know because it is so integral [to] who a person is,
and part of being an effective provider is being able to form that
rapport with your patients…form a therapeutic relationship
with them.”
Nurse, age 56 y: “[Patients are] very eager to educate. It’
s not
confirmation or approval, but acceptance I think is a better word.
This is what I am, to understand who I am.”
Normalization
Queer transgender male, age 28 y: “We’
re not asking you this
so that we can single you out, and we are asking everyone this
because it’
s important to track data, because it’
s relevant to
your health care.”
Queer woman, age 27 y: “It really was institutionalized that you
can have access to people’
s bodies and that is fine, and if they
didn’
t matter then it didn’
t matter what you did to [LGBT
people].”
Bisexual man, age 30 y: “[Routine collection] basically takes
the taboo away from it because I feel like a lot of people don’
t
feel comfortable sharing it because they’
re worried about how
to broach the topic.”
Bisexual man, age 30 y: “As long as it’
s routine and it’
s just
kind of like worked in there and it’
s treated like every other
question, then I don’
t really foresee any reason why it wouldn’
t
be received well.”
Physician assistant, age 37 y: “I think [including sexual
orientation questions within routine documentation questions]
would also be a great idea, only because then the patient
doesn’
t feel like they’
re getting singled out.”
Nurse, age 63 y: “I think it’
s just trying to be compassionate
and not judgmental…so I just try to explain that it’
s just
something that we have to ask every patient, you know, it’
s
just part of the documentation.”
Nurse, age 43 y: “I think if it was standard it would be good
because then people would be used to it.”

 education.29 Normalizing collection of sexual orientation in-
formation for every patient creates a dialogue between pa-
tients and health care professionals30 and promotes a wel-
coming, inclusive environment.31 Whereas there are data to
suggest that Asian Americans and Hispanics are more likely
to refuse to provide sexual orientation on a public health sur-
vey than are non-Hispanic whites,32 our data suggest no ra-
cial or ethnic differences in reporting sexual orientation in the
clinical setting. Previous research in community health set-
tings shows that patients think it is important for health care
professionals to know their sexual orientation and that they
are willing to provide such information when asked.33 The
present study extends these findings to the ED setting, indi-
cating that few patients will be offended or refuse to partici-
pate in routine collection of sexual orientation information.
Our data suggest that bisexual individuals are more likely
to refuse to provide sexual orientation than are straight indi-
viduals, which is in line with previous research.34 Prior re-
search indicates that bisexual individuals experience higher
levelsofidentityconfusion35anddisclosureeventslater36than
lesbian and gay individuals, thus potentially contributing to
refusal to disclose sexual orientation in the ED setting. In ad-
dition, bisexual individuals have been documented to expe-
rience double discrimination, in which both heterosexual and
lesbian/gay individuals report higher levels of binegative at-
titudes than bisexual individuals37; thus, bisexual individu-
als may be less willing to report sexual orientation to fit into
those communities without stigma.

 vide sexual orientation than are straight individuals. Previ-
ousresearchindicatesthatLGBindividualsthinkthatitismore
important to collect sexual orientation information routinely
compared with straight individuals33; thus, lesbians may be
less likely to refuse to provide sexual orientation than straight
individuals.
One of the most striking results of this study is the con-
tradictory views of willingness to provide sexual orientation
information between patients and clinicians. Given that fed-
eral regulations are moving toward requiring hospitals to col-
lectsexualorientationdata,12,41,42identifyingthepreferredway
to obtain this information among both patients and clinicians
is crucial. It is clear that sexual orientation information needs
to be asked of every patient, and this study identifies patient
preferences for methods of collection. We believe that the next
step will be testing different potential approaches for data

 collection. A trial aimed at doing this is presently under way
as part of the EQUALITY study.
Findings from this trial will be especially pertinent as
health centers around the country prepare for routine collec-
tion of sexual orientation information. Effective implemen-
tation of sexual orientation collection will require careful
examination of confidentiality, standardization of collection,
method of data collection, and cultural competency and
training.43 The implementation of Meaningful Use Stage 3
guidelines will mean that any hospital system using a certi-
fied EHR will have the capacity to record sexual orientation
data,12 thus easing routine collection. Many EDs and hospi-
tals are moving away from paper-based records, providing
an opportunity to incorporate electronic tablets into patient
care that integrate directly with the EHR. Thus, when a
patient registers for care, they could provide sexual orienta-
tion as part of demographic information on an electronic
tablet, which populates into the EHR that the clinical
team uses.
By not routinely asking patients for their sexual orienta-
tion information, clinicians may be alienating approximately
3% to 10% of the US population.9 In fact, the importance of
normalization and equality for the LGB community44 was a
central tenet in the US Supreme Court decision legalizing gay
marriage. It appears that society is ready for change in prac-
tice to promote such normalization and inclusion of LGB
patients. A key component to support changing practice
toward routine sexual orientation data collection will be
education and training of nurses, physicians, and other staff;
several health and LGBT organizations are already leading
the way with resources and trainings for this purpose.45
Limitations and Strengths
This study has several limitations. First, the qualitative
interview sample was from only 1 region of the United
States; however, the interviews informed the development
of the survey, which confirmed the interview themes in a
large, national survey sample. In addition, SAB members
provided valuable feedback on both interview and survey
questions and results. Second, there is an inability to easily
compare patient and clinician survey results with statistical
tests owing to differing sampling weights. Finally, the study

 was unable to discern how patients respond when actively
asked sexual orientation information in the clinical
setting.
This study also has a number of strengths. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to compare patients’and
clinicians’views of routine collection of sexual orientation
information. In addition, both the interview and survey
samples contain participants of varying age, race, and eth-
nicity, and the survey participants live in all regions of the
United States, thus contributing to the generalizability of
the results. Finally, the mixed methods design provides
robust data that could not be captured by qualitative or
quantitative methods alone.
Conclusions
Routinecollectionofdataonsexualorientationisimportantnot
only for individual patients but also for normalization of LGB
individualswithinthebroadersociety.Thisresearchshowsthat
patientsarewillingtobeaskedforsuchinformation,arenotlikely
to take offense, and prefer nonverbal collection methods. Rou-
tine collection of sexual orientation information in health care
isonthehorizon46,47andisnecessarytoimprovehealthdispari-
ties and clinical care for LGB patients. Identifying patient-
centeredwaystocollectthisinformationisimperativetocreate
a welcoming and inclusive environment for all patients.
