Abstract
We report a new type of brain-machine interface enabling a human operator to control nano-
meter-size robots inside a living animal by brain activity. Recorded EEG patterns are recog-
nized online by an algorithm, which in turn controls the state of an electromagnetic field. The
field induces the local heating of billions of mechanically-actuating DNA origami robots teth-
ered to metal nanoparticles, leading to their reversible activation and subsequent exposure
of a bioactive payload. As a proof of principle we demonstrate activation of DNA robots to
cause a cellular effect inside the insect Blaberus discoidalis, by a cognitively straining task.
This technology enables the online switching of a bioactive molecule on and off in response
to a subject’s cognitive state, with potential implications to therapeutic control in disorders
such as schizophrenia, depression, and attention deficits, which are among the most chal-
lenging conditions to diagnose and treat.
Introduction
Controlled drug delivery systems aim at improving the spatial and temporal resolution of ther-
apeutic molecules. For example, linking a drug to an antibody could render it highly selective
to the antibody’s cognate epitope, a concept already used in practice. However, the temporal
dimension is significantly more challenging. Drugs can be embedded in a matrix, such as a par-
ticle or liposome, from which they diffuse slowly into the bloodstream or tissue[1], and various
technologies combine this concept with spatial targeting [2]. However, until recently, no sys-
tem could provide explicit temporal control of a drug, e.g. generating a sequence of alternating
activation/inactivation of the drug for arbitrary periods of time. Any system that releases
drugs, regardless of release kinetics, is inherently irreversible and therefore does not provide
true therapeutic control (in the engineering sense of the term ‘control’).
Recently, drug-loaded nanoscale robots were reported, which would not release drug mole-
cules, but rather reversibly expose and conceal them to the environment while maintaining
them physically linked to their chassis[3]. These nanorobots are the first system that

 approaches real arbitrary control of therapeutic molecules; however, it requires comprehensive
knowledge of molecular targets discriminating healthy from abnormal environment states.
While in many diseases, such as cancer, these targets are well defined, other diseases are much
more difficult to characterize in molecular terms of good and bad, making them extremely elu-
sive to diagnose and treat. Mental disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, attention defi-
cits, and autism, exemplify this challenge. These conditions therefore require different modes
of control over therapeutic molecules, which are driven by patient’s mental and cognitive
states.
In the last two decades there has been extensive progress in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs), allowing both healthy and disabled individuals to control a wide range of devices using
mental activity alone[4,5]. The mental activity is decoded from brain activity by applying a
combination of signal processing and machine learning techniques to various neurophysiologi-
cal signals, recorded invasively or non-invasively. Such BCIs allow people to move a cursor on
a screen[6], navigate in virtual reality[7], control robots[8], robotic prostheses[9,10], and more.
Real-time brain mapping technologies are also suggested in assisting the diagnosis and treat-
ment of mental disorders, providing a new communication and control technology for disabled
individuals and the general population[11,12,13]. Nevertheless, so far no interface has been
established between a human mind and a therapeutic molecule, which are 10 orders of magni-
tude apart. The purpose of this study was to show that DNA robots can bridge this gap.
To establish a direct control interface to DNA robots, we designed robots that can be elec-
tronically remote-controlled. This was done by adding metal nanoparticles to the robotic gates,
which could heat in response to an electromagnetic field. This concept has been demonstrated
previously[13], and has been recently implemented in controlling gene expression in an animal
model of diabetes[14].
In this paper we integrate all these components to allow EEG patterns associated with cogni-
tive states to remotely trigger nanorobot activation in a living animal, and describe the design,
construction, and implementation of this brain-nanomachine interface. Our working proto-
type highlights the potential of such a technology in managing disorders to which no effective
treatment exists, and could inspire advanced modes of control over biological molecules in the
body even outside therapeutic contexts.
Methods
Experimental setup
The full experimental setup consisted of five components: a) a headset used for collecting EEG
data from the subject; b) an algorithm that searches for patterns associated with cognitive load
and rest states, running on a computer; c) a waveform generator, remote controlled by the
computer, which produces high-frequency alternate current through the coil; d) the coil itself;
and e) the DNA origami robots, injected into the living animal fitted within the coil. Data col-
lection was carried out separately from this setup, and included only the headset connected to a
computer (see Data collection below).
Data collection
Recording of EEG signals was conducted using 4 g.LADYbird sintered Ag/Cl crown active ring
electrodes located on the subject’s frontal lobe at PZ, FZ, AF3 and AF4 locations according to
the international 10–20 system. Reference electrode was positioned on the subject’s right ear
lobe and ground electrode was placed at Fpz location according to the international 10–20 sys-
tem. EEG signals were recorded at 256 Hz sampling rate, with amplification, analog filtering
(5–100 Hz) and notch filtering (50Hz) performed using g.USBamp amplifier (Guger

 Technologies, Schiedlberg, Austria). Data was stored on an HP PROBOOK laptop as generic
matrix (.mat) files for further analysis. EEG electrode placement was done using a g.GAMMA-
cap EEG cap (Guger Technologies, Schiedlberg, Austria), each electrode designated space
between the electrode and the participants scalp was filled with g.GAMMAgel (Guger Technol-
ogies, Schiedlberg, Austria) in order to assure high signal conduction. Reference electrode was
attached to the right ear lobe using the built in clip provided with the electrode. Six features
(RMS, Theta, Alpha, Low Beta, High Beta, and Gamma) were extracted from the raw EEG data
using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
SLACC algorithm design
For algorithm training, feature data from the raw EEG readings of 7 subjects was manually
classified into two classes (cognitive rest and cognitive load) and then reduced from FFT-
derived 24D vectors to 2D by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). LDA output, represented by
a 2D projected vector, was distributed into 4-second windows, with 3 second overlap between
them. Each window was subsequently entered into a support vector machine (SVM) for train-
ing, resulting in SVM distinction between the two classes. Data from the actual experiment was
processed in the same way through LDA before being entered into SVM for query and deci-
sion. A more detailed description of algorithm design and performance can be found in S1 File.
DNA origami robots
Robots were designed with caDNAno 2.0[15] (caDNAno files are available in the supporting
information to this paper), using the M13mp18 bacteriophage ssDNA as a scaffold strand. Sta-
ple strands were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Folding was carried out
in folding buffer (1X Tris-Acetate-EDTA supplemented with 10 mM Mg2+) on a standard ther-
mal cycler according the following annealing sequence: 80°C to 61°C at 5 min/°C, and then
60°C to 25°C at 60 min/°C. Folded robots were partially purified by a single round centrifugal
gel filtration on an Amicon Ultra column with molecular weight cutoff of 100 KDa. NHS-func-
tionalized iron oxide nanoparticles were covalently attached to the robots using the internal
amino-deoxythymidine residues introduced in the design process, by mixing nanoparticles and
robots at a nanoparticle molar excess of 100:1, followed by two more rounds of purification.
Prior to injection, robots were exchanged into phosphate buffered saline containing 10 mM
Mg2+. Antibody Fab’ fragment payload was prepared by cleaving whole IgG molecules using a
commercially available Fab’ preparation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
antibody fragments were tagged by amine-reactive DyLight 650, purified and chemically conju-
gated to amine-modified U1c DNA (5’-NH2-GAACTGGAGTAGCACAA-3’) using EDC con-
jugation. Following purification of the product, the payload fragments were mixed with robots
at a molar excess of 20:1 (payloads over robots) for at least 1 hour at room temperature, prior
to addition of guide removal strands and a final purification round of loaded robots.
Animals
Adult B. discoidalis insects were purchased from Meital Labs (Israel) and maintained in red
soil-layered plastic containers. Empty egg cartons were used as light shelters, with food (dry
dog food and fresh fruit) and water (moist cotton wool in a plastic vessel) kept fresh and pro-
vided ad-libitum. The maximum number of insects per container was 12. After an initial
adjustment period during which approximately 1 of every 8 insects died, the insects were main-
tained for up to 6 months without evident signs of stress or further deaths. The containers were
monitored at all time using a web video camera connected to a DVR that stored the last 14
days of visual data.

 Ex vivo/in-vivo experiments
Injections were performed in a sequence and not in parallel, to minimize animal stress. Each
insect in turn was incubated in a clean glass beaker at -20°C for 7–10 min, depending on its
size and behavior. Robots (100 fmol in 10 μL phosphate buffered saline containing 10 mM
Mg2+) were injected using a Hamilton syringe to the insect’s abdomen in a flat angle through
the membrane between the two apical sternites. After the injection, the insects were inserted
into the coil such that the abdomen was exactly in the middle of the coil’s length. The custom-
built coil was connected to a Rohde-Schwartz SML02 signal generator, producing a 14.6 MHz
signal at 50 W such that an electromagnetic field of 5 mT was generated inside the coil. The
Hamilton syringe was cleaned with water and 70% ethanol in between injections. After finish-
ing the experimental sequence, the animal was lightly anesthetized again, and hemolymph was
extracted by puncturing the left arthrodial membrane using a G18 needle pre-wetted with anti-
coagulant buffer (30 mM citric acid, 30 mM sodium citrate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% w/v NaN3),
and aspirating the exudate directly into an ice-cooled pipette tip filled with 25 μL cold anticoag-
ulant buffer. The exudate was then diluted 1:1 into ice-cold anticoagulant buffer and analyzed
by flow cytometry. For ex-vivo experiments, hemolymph cells were isolated from untreated,
lightly anesthetized animals by puncturing and aspirating exactly as described above.
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was performed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm solid-
state laser and a 640 nm diode laser. Data were coarse-analyzed using FlowPlus software fol-
lowed by analysis on FCS-Express 4.0 software (using a C6 import module).
Results and Discussion
The nanoscale DNA robots used in this study were a modified version of the nanorobot we
described previously. Providing the nanorobots with the ability to respond to electromagnetic
fields enables autonomous sensing of biomolecules and possibly computational abilities [3, 14].
A crucial advantage of these robots is that they integrate a solid shell, fabricated from DNA ori-
gami, with gates made of complementary DNA strands. The shell can be reversibly closed or
opened by controlling gate strand hybridization, using strand displacement, aptamer binding,
etc. When the shell is closed, it sequesters molecular or nanoparticulate payloads of various
types up to a size of 25 nm, such that they are concealed from the environment. Opening of the
shell exposes these payloads, which remain stably tethered to the shell and are not released.
Thus, by controlling the shell, it is possible to reversibly switch therapeutic molecules between
exposed/concealed states equivalent to on/off states, respectively. As the robots do not enter
cells efficiently and remain mostly extracellular, they can only support payloads that engage
cell surface targets. This seems like an inherent drawback of the system; however it should be
noted that any therapeutic outcome could arguably be achieved from outside the cell, since
almost all endogenous signals operate through cell surface receptors (with exceptions such as
steroid hormones and nitric oxide).
The second goal was to control DNA remotely from outside the host’s system. Therefore,
we re-designed the robots to enable the addition of functionalized metal nanoparticles, which
could be heated by applying a radio frequency-induced electromagnetic field (RFMF) on the
entire animal. Few previous studies demonstrated remote control over DNA hybridization
using gold nanocrystals[16], however only in-vitro. In contrast, many works reported the in-
vitro and in-vivo heating of metal nanoparticles for purposes of tumor killing, control of enzy-
matic activity, drug delivery, or inducing gene expression[17],[18],[19]. As an animal model
for this proof of concept we chose the insect B. discoidalis, which was recently employed as a

 model for molecular control by DNA origami, showing high compatibility and reproducibility
[14].
As a proof of principle we focused on driving the activity of DNA robots inside a living ani-
mal by an induced state of cognitive load in the test subject. To induce cognitive load, we com-
piled a test from simple arithmetic problems, which the subject was required to solve during
the defined cognitive load phase of the experiment. The test was projected onto a screen in
front of the subject, followed by a screen designed to move the subject back to cognitive rest.
We then designed and trained a pattern classification algorithm, termed SLACC, to discrimi-
nate on-line between these two states in the raw EEG data recorded from the subject. SLACC
achieved a precision of 92.5% and sensitivity of 86.3% (Fig 1A–1C). A detailed description and
performance analysis of this algorithm can be found in S1 and S2 Files.
We chemically attached iron oxide nanoparticles to each gate of the robots (Fig 2A and 2B),
and loaded the robots with fluorescent antibody fragments recognizing surface epitopes on the
cells of the insect B. discoidalis. The suspended cells were then placed inside an induction coil
through which a 14.6 MHz RFMF was applied by a signal generator. The signal generator was
activated only when the test subject’s EEG pattern was recognized by our classification algo-
rithm as cognitive load. RFMF activation induced robot opening and subsequent cellular stain-
ing by the exposed fluorescent antibody fragments which was tracked in real-time. An increase
in cell fluorescence was observed as early at t = 18s following field activation (t = 0), which
peaked rapidly until t = 42 s and continued to increase slowly, reaching maximal level at t = 3.8
min (Fig 2C). The robot gates have a predicted melting temperature (Tm) of 56°C. However, as
previously described, these gates hold together the two parts of the robot shell, each with a
mass of 2.4×106 Da, imposing an entropic penalty to the hybridized gate strands, rendering

 them less stable and more leaky than predicted by Tm alone. Therefore, the increase in temper-
ature (ΔT) required for robot opening is likely smaller than that required for reaching the pre-
dicted Tm. Assuming a ΔT of 15°C, we estimate that the gate strands were heated by the metal
nanoparticles at an approximate rate of 0.25°C/s. Importantly, robots that were heated by a
5-min RFMF and allowed to re-close following field deactivation did not stain the insect cells
(Fig 2D), confirming that heating for 5 min did not melt the robot shell. This observation is in
agreement with a recent report showing that the melting of 3D DNA origami structures occurs
at a critical temperature that is ~10°C higher (depending on specific shape) than the critical
temperature at which folding occurs[20]. This allows a protection margin for heating and
reversible payload exposure before the robots likely melt.
The system was integrated by connecting the signal generator to the human subject through
the computer on which the algorithm operates. The robots were injected to adult B. discoidalis
and the animals were inserted into the coil. Following a 1 min recuperation period, the test began.
During the test, the subject’s EEG was acquired and monitored by the algorithm, which controlled
the RFMF generator in real-time. The experiment was repeated separately five times. At the end
of each experiment, insect hemocytes were extracted and analyzed for fluorescence (Fig 3A). This
analysis showed that robots bearing metal nanoparticles opened and engaged the cells efficiently,
generating signals comparable to those generated by constitutively-open robots. In contrast,
robots not bearing nanoparticles, or those that bear nanoparticles but were not loaded with fluo-
rescent antibody, did not generate any visible signal (Fig 3B). These findings demonstrate a suc-
cessful interface between the test subject and the DNA robots inside the living animals.
We chose brain activity as the signal of choice in our paradigm but that does not necessary
mean it is the most suitable signal; it is but one chosen physiological parameter with which we

 decided to demonstrate this system. Moreover, just as BCI technology is becoming more wide-
spread and accessible, so are heart monitoring applications for mobile devices, and in the future
even parameters such as blood glucose.
The present study is merely a demonstration and proof of concept for integrating physiolog-
ical output with molecular control. And here is also the value of this work–in our hope that it
will highlight the possibility for such new therapeutic strategies, and encourage building on
such drafts in order to achieve optimal designs.
Albeit a very preliminary prototype, this system could inspire improved designs towards
thought-mediated control over biochemical and physiological functions assisted by biocompat-
ible molecular machines.
