Study Objectives: We aimed to compare 2-year-old children born preterm with children born full term regarding: (1) sleep characteristics, (2) temperament, 
and (3) relations between sleep pattern and habits and temperament.
Methods: The study included 51 preterm children with normal cognitive, language, and motor development (mean = 20.94 months, standard deviation 
[SD] = 4.08) and 57 full-term children (mean = 21.19, SD = 4.32). To assess sleep-related difficulties and habits and child temperament, mothers completed 
the following questionnaires: the (1) Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children—adapted (SDSC); (2) Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ); and (3) Italian 
Temperament Questionnaires—version 12-36 months (QUIT).
Results: Preterm children needed less support to fall asleep and fell asleep more often alone in their own bed compared to those born at full term; however, 
preterm children showed more frequent sleep difficulties, such as restlessness and breathing problems during the night. In addition, preterm children had 
lower scores in the temperamental dimension of attention and higher scores in negative emotionality than full-term children. Finally, sleep problems were 
correlated with higher motor activity, lower social orientation and attention, and increased negative emotionality; a shorter nocturnal sleep duration was 
related to higher motor activity and lower inhibition to novelty whereas an earlier rise time was associated with lower attention and social orientation.
Conclusions: Preterm children showed sleep pattern problems and disturbance, predominance of attention problems, and negative emotionality related to 
sleep disruption.

INTRODUCTION
Children born preterm are at increased risk for neurodevel-
opmental problems in various areas, such as language, motor 
skills, behavior, and self-regulation.1,2 Some studies have indi-
cated that preterm children may also have sleep disturbances 
such as shorter daytime rest and nighttime sleep duration, as 
well as decreased sleep quality in the first and second year 
of life,3,4 showing that sleep is significantly less restful than 
that of full-term children. Also later in life, at 3 years of age, 
sleep disturbances have been described in preterm children, al-
though a reduction of sleep problems was reported at 5 years.5 
Furthermore, it has been observed that children with very low 
birth weight are at risk for reduced sleep efficiency at 8 years 
and advanced sleep onset times in adulthood.6,7 Preterm chil-
dren may also present sleep-disordered breathing more fre-
quently than full-term children during middle childhood.8 All 
these sleep disturbances have been associated with subsequent 
developmental disturbances, suggesting that adequate sleep 
is a fundamental requisite for an optimal infant development. 
Several researchers showed that sleep is particularly important 
during the early development phases. Sleep deprivation could 
determine cellular damage,9 hippocampal oxidative stress,10,11 
and suppression of neurogenesis.12 It may also influence brain 
areas such as frontal lobes involved in motivation, goal direc-
tion, and attentional abilities.13 Therefore, in the developing 
brain, sleep deprivation during critical periods may result in

morbid and potentially irreversible changes in neural organiza-
tion of these brain structures.14
Conversely, other studies have found that preterm children 
do not differ in their sleep features, such as sleep duration, 
bed sharing, night waking or time of sleep onset, from full-
term children.3,15 Researchers have attempted to identify the 
etiology of sleep difficulties in preterm children in terms of 
exposure to early neonatal stressors, such as nonphysiologi-
cal nutrition, hypoxia, repeated painful experiences, abnormal 
light, and noise.16–18
BRIEF SUMMARY
Current Knowledge/Study Rationale: Preterm birth is a risk factor 
for many areas of neurological and psychological development. 
Little is known about sleep quality and habits of preterm children 
beyond the neonatal period and research findings, to date, have 
been inconclusive. Very few studies have analyzed the relationship 
between sleep patterns and temperament in preterm children 
compared to children born full term.
Study Impact: Our findings show that preterm children with no 
deficit in cognitive, language, and motor areas, in the second year 
of life, have relatively more frequent sleep difficulties during the 
night and different sleep habits compared to full-term children. The 
temperament of preterm children seems to be characterized by a 
lower level of attention and more negative emotionality compared 
to full-term children. We observed a link between sleep pattern and 
temperament in preterm children and found that sleep problems were 
related to increased negative emotionality and decreased attention.

B Caravale, S Sette, E Cannoni, et al. Sleep and Temperament in Preterm Children
The persistent attitude of parents of preterm children in the 
perception of their children as fragile and vulnerable and their 
reaction to the child’s waking could be an important factor in 
the development of sleep problems.19 In fact, preterm infants 
are generally less able to provide clear distress signals, are 
more easily stressed, and may not show the same rich variety 
of interactional capacities seen in those born at term.20 Such 
difficulties may contribute to less adequate parenting, which 
may play a role in sleep development.21 Moreover, lack of con-
stant physical bonding and challenging breastfeeding in pre-
term children may also contribute to higher stress response, 
less organized sleep, and difficult maternal–infant interac-
tions.22–24 Finally, melatonin rhythmicity may develop more 
slowly in preterm than in full-term children.17,25
It is known that sleep in children is likely to be influenced 
not only by environmental and biological factors but also by 
individual characteristics such as child temperament.26 Tem-
perament has been variously defined27–29; for the current study, 
we used the temperamental model developed by Thomas and 
Chess, which focuses on the goodness of fit between child and 
environment. The model includes different cognitive, emo-
tional, and relational processes such as attention, negative and 
positive emotionality, motor control activity, social orienta-
tion, and inhibition to novelty.28
Overall, recent studies have reported that during the first 
months of life, preterm children may manifest a higher de-
gree of negative reactivity,30,31 a limited capacity to modulate 
arousal, and lower thresholds to negative emotionality.32 In 
addition, preterm children may present a greater use of dis-
tancing during dyadic play compared to their full-term coun-
terparts, indicating a lower capacity for self-regulation even in 
routine interactions.33 There is also evidence that a history of 
painful procedures in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) 
is associated with poor sustained attention and with a higher 
basal level of cortisol during the first years of life.18,34 Neonatal 
pain has also been linked to the internalization of behavioral 
problems in preterm children at 18 months of age35 and a higher 
reactivity to pain was related to negative affectivity tempera-
ment in toddlerhood among preterm children.36
It is known that a difficult child temperament, such as be-
ing irritable, fussy, or hypersensitive, may interfere with sleep 
consolidation in the first months of life and is associated with 
sleep problems in general during childhood. Moreover, pa-
rental behavior in response to awakenings is highly related to 
the child’s sleep rhythmicity and with the endurance of sleep 
problems.37,38 Longitudinal studies have confirmed a positive 
association between difficult temperament profile and sleep 
problems over the first 2 years of life.39
However, to the best of our knowledge only 1 study has 
analyzed the association between temperament and sleep in 
preterm children.40 In this study, 21 preterm children were 
assessed at 3 time points: during the neonatal period, during 
toddlerhood, and during the preschool age period. During tod-
dlerhood, low birth weight and low scores in sociability were 
significant predictors of sleep problems. Nevertheless, the 
study lacked a control group and sleep was assessed only con-
sidering a global measure of sleep problems using the Child 
Behavior Checklist (CBCL).
Therefore, because very few studies have been carried out in 
order to evaluate the relation between sleep quality and habits 
and temperament in preterm children, the aims of this study 
were to investigate: (1) the characteristics of sleep (in terms 
of sleep-related difficulties and habits), (2) the temperamen-
tal dimensions, and (3) the relations between sleep pattern and 
temperament in a group of preterm children.
METHODS
Participants
The current study is part of a larger investigation on the neu-
rodevelopment of preterm children. The study group is com-
posed of 51 preterm children recruited from the NICU of a 
public hospital in Rome, Italy (Umberto I General Hospital). 
The sample was composed of 5 extremely preterm children 
(< 28 weeks of gestational age), 17 very preterm children (28 
to < 32 weeks gestational age), and 29 moderate to late pre-
term children (32 to < 37 weeks gestational age). Data collected 
from the hospital medical charts revealed that among them, 
2 (4%) had sepsis, 4 (7.9%) had intraventricular hemorrhage 
grade I-II, 4 (7.9%) had intraventricular hemorrhage grade III-
IV, 1 (2%) had periventricular leukomalacia, and 11 (21.6%) 
had neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The length 
of stay in the NICU ranged from 9 to 88 days (mean = 36.21, 
standard deviation [SD] = 21.12).
As a part of their follow-up evaluation, during the first year 
of life, children were assessed for cognitive, language, and mo-
tor development by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler 
Development-Third Edition (BSID-III).41 In the current study, 
we included only preterm children who did not have a delay 
in cognitive, language, and motor areas, defined as a BSID-
III scaled score in each scale of less than 2 SD relative to the 
mean.
The control group consists of 57 healthy full-term children 
recruited from 3 daycare centers in the same geographic area 
as the preterm group. For both groups, children with a genetic 
syndrome, major congenital anomalies, and neurosensory or 
motor disabilities, as well as mothers who did not possess an 
adequate Italian language level, were excluded from the study.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
Department of Developmental and Social Psychology, Sapi-
enza, University of Rome.
Procedure
Mothers of preterm children were approached by doctors or 
psychologists in the course of the second year of life of their 
children during one of their hospital follow-up visits and solic-
ited for participation in the study. For each daycare center, the 
director of the center contacted the mothers of the control group 
to explain the aims of the study. A written parental consent was 
obtained from all participants before inclusion in the study. 
Two research assistants trained in child assessment explained 
the questionnaires on temperament and sleep to each parent, 
administered the questionnaires, and remained available for 
any clarification during completion. The completion of the 
questionnaires was checked as soon as parents returned them.

Measures
Assessment of infant sleep
To assess the infant sleep-related difficulties and habits, all 
mothers completed the following measures:
1. The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children—adapted 
(SDSC).42 A revised version of the SDSC questionnaire 
was used and adapted for use with toddlers in order 
to identify the presence of sleep disturbances. From 
the original scale, we selected 12 items (removing 
14 items deemed to be inappropriate for age). An 
exploratory factor analysis on the 12 items yielded 
2 correlated factors named (a) bedtime difficulties 
(composed of 3 items, eg, a child’s difficulty or refusal 
to fall asleep) with factor loadings ranging from 
0.40 to 0.93 and a good internal consistency (α = .72) 
and (b) sleep difficulties (composed of 9 items, eg, 
nocturnal movement, restlessness during the night, or 
breathing problems) with factor loadings ranging from 
0.37 to 0.68 and a good internal consistency (α = .76). 
Responses were given on a 3-point Likert scale with 
higher values reflecting a greater difficulty with 
bedtime and sleep.
2. Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ).43 The BISQ 
aims to evaluate sleep pattern and habits and it is 
composed of questions related to the following areas: 
(a) bedtime, (b) rise time, (c) nocturnal sleep duration, 
(d) daytime sleep duration, (e) number of nighttime 
awakenings, (f) nocturnal wakefulness, (g) latency to 
falling asleep during the night (or settling time), (h) 
method of falling asleep, and (i) location of sleep.
Assessment of infant temperament
To evaluate the infant temperament, we used the Italian Tem-
perament Questionnaires—version 12-36 months (QUIT).44 
The questionnaire is composed of 56 items rated on a 6-point 
Likert scale (1 = almost never to 6 = almost always) describ-
ing infant behavior in 3 different contexts: (1) child interac-
tion with others, (2) child during play, and (3) child during an 
activity or a task. In total, 6 temperamental dimensions were 
assessed: (1) Social Orientation (9 items; infant interest and at-
tention towards others); (2) Inhibition to Novelty (12 items; in-
fant emotional reactivity toward contextual stimuli); (3) Motor 
Activity (11 items; infant physical activity); (4) Positive Emo-
tionality (10 items; infant expression of positive emotions); (5) 
Negative Emotionality (6 items; infant expression of negative 
emotions); and (6) Attention (8 items; infant ability to keep the 
focus of his/her attention). The scores of each dimension were 
averaged to create Social Orientation, Inhibition to Novelty, 
Motor Activity, Positive Emotionality, Negative Emotionality, 
and Attention rates for each infant. Overall, each dimension of 
the QUIT showed an acceptable internal consistency.44,45
Statistical Analysis
Analyses of variance were conducted to analyze differences in 
sleep difficulties, sleep habits, and temperamental dimensions 
between preterm and control groups. Then, we ran a series of 
chi square tests (χ2) and Fisher exact tests to compare preterm 
and control groups for their method of falling asleep, location 
of sleep, and settling time. Finally, Pearson correlations were 
performed in preterm children to examine the associations 
among temperamental dimensions, sleep difficulties, and sleep 
habits.

tional age, and birth weight) and the type of feeding for the pre-

B Caravale, S Sette, E Cannoni, et al. Sleep and Temperament in Preterm Children
shows the maternal age and education for both groups. Preterm 
children had a gestational age and weight at birth lower than 
that of full-term children. In addition, we found that preterm 
children were less frequently breastfed than full-term children. 
No differences have been found for maternal education and 
maternal age.
Preterm children displayed more medical sleep problems (eg, 
nocturnal movement, restlessness during the night and breath-
ing problems, as assessed by the SDSC questionnaire) than the 
control group (Table 2) whereas behavioral sleep problems 
as assessed by the BISQ were less frequent. Indeed, preterm 
children needed less support to fall asleep (hold in arms or in 
parent bed), fell asleep more often alone in their own bed, and 
slept less often in the parent bed than the full-term children. 
No other significant differences were found (Table 3).
Regarding temperament, the preterm group reported lower 
scores in attention and higher scores in negative emotionality 
than the control group (Table 4).
Significant and positive correlations in preterm children 
were found between bedtime difficulties and both motor ac-
tivity and negative emotionality and between nocturnal sleep 
duration and inhibition to novelty. Negative correlations were 
observed between sleep difficulties and social orientation, 
positive emotionality, and attention; between the rise time and 
both social orientation and attention dimensions; and between 
nocturnal sleep duration and motor activity (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
Our findings show that preterm children have a relatively high 
degree of medical sleep problems during the night and a lower 
degree of behavioral sleep problems, such as lower need of 
support from parents to fall asleep, compared to full-term chil-
dren, whereas no differences were found between the 2 groups 
on sleep patterns such as bedtime, rise time, and nocturnal and 
daytime sleep durations.
These results are similar to those of previous studies on 
sleep in preterm children, although many controversial find-
ings have been previously published in the literature. Some 
authors found a poorer sleep quality (in terms of restful sleep 
during the night) in preterm versus full-term children, at ap-
proximately 20 months of corrected age4 and an increase in the 
number of night awakenings and in the time spent with mouth 
breathing.46 However, other studies were in agreement with 
our findings, showing that preterm children exhibited fewer 
and shorter night awakenings at age 3 months and settled more 
quickly once awakened at 5 months of age than full-term chil-
dren and no differences have been found in sleeping behavior 
at age 20 months and at preschool age.5,47 Furthermore, our 
results are also in agreement with other studies showing no 
differences on bedtime, rise time, nocturnal and daytime sleep 
durations, bed sharing, nighttime waking, bedtime resistance, 
and sleep onset difficulties.15,48
In our study, we only included preterm children with no def-
icit in cognitive, language, and motor areas, to ensure a sample 
as homogeneous as possible. Our criteria excluded the majority 
of preterm infants who had a complicated NICU course and 
who could present with different, and probably more severe, 
sleep problems often linked to the presence of a severe neuro-
logical damage.49
Despite the fact that no differences in bedtime, rise time, 
or sleep duration have been found in preterm versus full-term

B Caravale, S Sette, E Cannoni, et al. Sleep and Temperament in Preterm Children
children, the sleep problems described by the parents of preterm 
children (restlessness, breathing problems during sleep) could 
have resulted in sleep disruption, which has been associated with 
alteration of daytime behavior, attention, and learning difficulties 
during childhood and adolescence as reported in the literature.50,51
Regarding temperamental characteristics, we showed that 
preterm children had lower levels of attention and more nega-
tive emotionality (eg, crying, stranger wariness) than full-term 
children. These results are consistent with previous studies 
demonstrating that children born preterm are at risk of atten-
tion and learning problems40 as well as emotional difficulties.52 
Accordingly, a review conducted on attention development dur-
ing the first 4 years of age confirmed a decrease of sustained 
attention and visual orientation of attention in preterm children 
compared to their counterparts born at full term.53 Furthermore, 
some authors found that preterm children at 2 months corrected 
age expressed more negative affect during repeated exposure 
to the modified still-face procedure than the full-term children, 
confirming, thus, the preterm children’s difficulty in regulating 
their distress.30 Similarly, another study found that very preterm 
children expressed more negative emotions, in terms of fear and 
frustration, than full-term children in tasks assessing emotional 
abilities.54 The negative affectivity may represent a significant 
predictor of both internalizing and externalizing behaviors, as 
suggested by some authors with a sample of children aged from 
18 to 36 months who were born preterm.55
It is noteworthy that our results support an association be-
tween sleep quality and child temperamental characteristics. 
Correlational analyses showed that sleep difficulties were as-
sociated with increased motor activity, lower social orientation 
and attention, and more negative emotionality. Furthermore, a 
shorter nocturnal sleep duration was related to increased motor 
activity and lower inhibition to novelty, whereas an earlier rise 
time was associated with lower attention and social orientation.
An increase in motor activity is often reported by parents 
of children with sleep problems and may also be related to dif-
ficulties in attention and social interactions.56 It is possible that 
sleep difficulties in preterm children interfere with brain matu-
ration that, in turn, may compromise the children’s cognitive 
and regulatory abilities.56 Previous studies also underlined the 
parents’ role in helping children to regulate sleep and executive 
functions.57 Parents may have more difficulties in being external 
regulators for preterm children given their child’s vulnerability 
to a range of cognitive, attentional, and behavioral problems.
Therefore, our findings also confirm a link between sleep-
related difficulties and temperament in children born preterm. 
Most of the previous studies focused their attention on full-
term children, demonstrating that sleep may be related to infant 
individual characteristics as well as environmental factors.26 
A previous study found that a longer nocturnal sleep duration 
was related to infant approachability at 3, 6, and 11.5 months.58 
Other authors have shown associations between infant nega-
tive temperament (in terms of distress to limitations and fear), 
the difficulty in putting infants to sleep, sleep problems, and 
longer wakefulness in the night during the first year of life.59
To the best of our knowledge, only one study analyzed the 
link between temperament and sleep in preterm children and 
reported an association between sleep problems and low socia-
bility during toddlerhood.40 Although the authors considered a 
global measure of sleep problems derived from the CBCL, we

B Caravale, S Sette, E Cannoni, et al. Sleep and Temperament in Preterm Children
found similar results confirming an association between sleep 
problems and difficulty in children’s social orientation. In con-
trast, childrens’ optimal sleep may be related to their adaptive 
functioning during the day in terms of social engagement and 
peer acceptance.60
Based on a transactional model of infant sleep, tempera-
mental characteristics might directly interfere with sleep con-
solidation or may influence the parents’ behavioral response 
to their children, thereby affecting their sleep.61 Infant sleep 
develops in dynamic and complex transactions between infant 
temperament and parent emotional quality. Therefore, it is im-
portant to examine both sleep and temperament and their inter-
relationships in order to provide a correct approach for infant 
sleep problems.61
Although the current study is one of the first on the relation-
ship between different aspects of sleep (eg, duration, location of 
sleep) and temperament in preterm children, some limitations 
of this research should be considered when interpreting results. 
First, the cross-sectional nature of our data prevents us from 
analyzing possible direct relationships between infant sleep and 
temperament in preterm children. It is possible that infant sleep 
may influence the expression of temperament in terms of motor 
activity and less attention during the day or that infant tem-
peramental characteristics may play a role in influencing infant 
sleep.62 Therefore, future studies that might analyze these asso-
ciations longitudinally may help us to better understand the link 
between infant sleep and temperament, as well as their associa-
tions with socioemotional adjustment over time.
Furthermore, we only considered parental ratings on sleep 
and temperamental characteristics with no other objective sleep 
measures (such as actigraphy or polysomnography) or different 
informants (eg, teachers versus parents). The inclusion of dif-
ferent objective informants may be useful to better understand 
the effect of sleep quality on children’s social behaviors in dif-
ferent contexts. Finally, it would be interesting to replicate the 
results of the current study in other cultural samples to improve 
our knowledge on the association between preterm children 
temperament and sleep in different samples/cultures.
In conclusion, we found a link between sleep and tempera-
ment in preterm children, demonstrating that sleep problems are 
related to more negative emotionality and lower attention. There-
fore, it is important that pediatricians screen sleep more rigor-
ously in preterm children, especially with respect to sleep-related 
breathing disorders and sleep-related movement disorders.
Interventions on the quality of the infant-caregiver rela-
tionship as well as environmental modification or behavioral 
treatment might be useful to improve sleep quality of preterm 
children and hopefully modify the negative temperamental 
characteristics of preterm children during early childhood.63
