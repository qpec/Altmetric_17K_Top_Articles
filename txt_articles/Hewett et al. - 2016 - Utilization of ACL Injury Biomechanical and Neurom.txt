Abstract
Background—The widespread use of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury prevention 
interventions has not been effective in reducing the injury incidence among female athletes who 
participate in high-risk sports.
Purpose/Hypothesis—The purpose of this study was to determine if biomechanical and 
neuromuscular factors that contribute to the knee abduction moment (KAM), a predictor of future 
ACL injuries, could be used to characterize athletes by a distinct factor. Specifically, we 
hypothesized that a priori selected biomechanical and neuromuscular factors would characterize 
participants into distinct at-risk profiles.
Study Design—Controlled laboratory study.
Methods—A total of 624 female athletes who participated in jumping, cutting, and pivoting 
sports underwent testing before their competitive season. During testing, athletes performed drop-
jump tasks from which biomechanical measures were captured. Using data from these tasks, latent 
profile analysis (LPA) was conducted to identify distinct profiles based on preintervention bio-
mechanical and neuromuscular measures. As a validation, we examined whether the profile 
membership was a significant predictor of the KAM.
Results—LPA using 6 preintervention biomechanical measures selected a priori resulted in 3 
distinct profiles, including a low (pro-file 1), moderate (profile 2), and high (profile 3) risk for

 ACL injuries. Athletes with profiles 2 and 3 had a significantly higher KAM compared with those 
with profile 1 (P < .05).
Conclusion—This is the first study to use LPA of biomechanical landing data to create ACL 
injury risk profiles. Three distinct risk groups were identified based on differences in the peak 
KAM.
Clinical Relevance—These findings demonstrate the existence of discernable groups of athletes 
that may benefit from injury prevention interventions.

An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most common and debilitating knee 
injuries, especially among young female athletes. Seventy percent of ACL injuries are 
classified as noncontact, and more than 70% of those occur during jump landing.13 While 
noncontact injuries may be considered preventable, the role of biomechanical and 
neuromuscular risk factors in the prediction of ACL injuries remains controversial. External 
loads on the knee in the frontal plane, specifically the knee abduction moment (KAM), 
predict ACL injuries with high sensitivity and specificity.11 Faulty neuromuscular movement 
patterns that contribute to an increased KAM reportedly increase with age and first appear, 
most frequently in female patients, with the onset of pubertal maturation.10
Initial evidence indicated that neuromuscular training programs were effective in reducing 
the ACL injury risk in female athletes.9,15,19,23 However, even with widespread education 
and the institution of ACL injury prevention interventions, female athletes who participate in 
high-risk sports have not decreased their incidence of injuries.1,3,5,12 It has been suggested 
that the disparity between laboratory results and incidence outcomes may be related to the 
difficulty in implementing prevention programs.17 An alternative theory was proposed by 
Myklebust et al,20 who conducted a 10-year review of a Norwegian female handball ACL 
injury prevention study. The authors investigated whether ACL injury prevention initiatives 
had been effective. Myklebust et al20 reported that the ACL injury rate could be kept low 
through preventive initiatives but that risk factor studies are necessary to identify the 
patient's needs for special training and optimize the selection of preventive exercises.
Different athletic maneuvers may elicit specific movement patterns that are inherent to 
athletes at risk for ACL injuries. A double-leg landing immediately followed by a plyometric 
maximum vertical jump typically induces knee abduction motion in female athletes. Single-
leg landings are also important tasks, as off-balance landings may mimic injurious 
conditions that are common during sports play. Consequently, 2 movements that may 
specifically play an important role in injury risk screening involve a drop vertical jump 
(DVJ), designed to monitor medial knee collapse, and a crossover single-leg drop (SCD), 
designed to elicit both knee abduction motion and trunk motion. Challenging athletes to 
perform these specific tasks during screening may help identify those athletes who will 
benefit most from training to reduce the risk of ACL injuries.

 Latent profile analysis (LPA) is a statistical tool that has primarily been used in the field of 
social science to characterize phenotypically alike patients into clusters or groups. The use 
of LPA is currently being explored more frequently in biomedical research. As such, LPA is 
a novel and potentially powerful tool to characterize the biomechanical and neuromuscular 
risk factors that underlie the ACL injury risk. The purpose of this article was to determine if 
LPA could be used to identify patient phenotypes based on the risk for future ACL injuries. 
Specifically, we hypothesized that biomechanical and neuromuscular factors contributing to 
the KAM during a DVJ and SCD would characterize participants into distinct injury risk 
profiles associated with a patient's risk for future ACL injuries.
Methods
Participants
This was a controlled laboratory study. The cohort consisted of 624 female athletes recruited 
from 52 regional basketball, soccer, and volleyball teams. Participants were required to have 
no history of ACL injuries or knee surgery and no lower extremity injuries or low back pain 
the year before study participation that required medical intervention. Testing was conducted 
before and after competitive seasons. Only data from the initial testing session, however, 
were used for the purpose of the current investigation. Participants and parents provided 
informed consent, approved by an institutional review board, before study procedures were 
initiated.
Procedures
Before initiating the screening process, participants' height and weight were recorded, and 
pubertal categories (prepubertal, pubertal, and postpubertal) were documented using the 
Pubertal Maturational Observational Scale (PMOS).4
All testing was conducted in a single laboratory. Three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis 
testing included the collection of kinematic data using a 10-camera motion capture system 
(Eagle Cameras; Motion Analysis Corp) at 240 Hz. Kinetic data were collected at 1200 Hz 
from 2 force plates (AMTI) embedded into the floor and synchronized with motion data. 
Each participant was instrumented with 55 retroreflective markers, which were placed by a 
single experienced member of the investigative team. The methods and results for 
establishing marker placement reliability and validity, as well as a comprehensive 
description of marker locations, have been previously published.8,11 After marker 
placement, an astatic trial with the participant positioned in an anatomic neutral position was 
performed to define each patient's neutral alignment. Subsequent kinematic measures were 
referenced in relation to this position.
Testing consisted of the SCD, DVJ, and single-leg drop (SLD) maneuvers from a 31-cm box 
(Figure 1). For the purpose of developing injury risk profiles, only the SCD and DVJ tasks 
were utilized for analysis. The SCD was performed by balancing on 1 foot and then 
dropping forward and medially off the box, landing on the opposite leg. During the DVJ, the 
participant dropped off the box with both feet leaving at the same time, landing with each 
foot onto separate force platforms, and then immediately performing a maximum vertical

 jump. Tasks were performed in a randomized order with the landing side further randomized 
within each movement.
Data Management
The mean values for the 3 trials for each limb and each task were averaged, and the average 
was used for subsequent analysis. The interval of interest was the initial landing phase of 
each jump. Landing was defined from initial contact, when the vertical ground-reaction 
force first exceeded 10 N, to the lowest point of the body's center of mass (COM).22 Marker 
trajectories and force plate data used for joint moment calculation were filtered with a 
bidirectional low-pass fourth-order Butterworth digital filter (12-Hz cutoff frequency). Force 
plate data used in calculating peak ground-reaction force data were additionally filtered with 
a bidirectional low-pass fourth-order Butterworth digital filter (100-Hz cutoff frequency). 
The hip joint center was determined using a validated anthropometrics-based calculation.2 
Euler angles were used to describe lower extremity motions, and joint moments were 
calculated using inverse dynamics (C-Motion Inc; MathWorks Inc).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical testing was performed with SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute). Descriptive analysis 
of all demographic data consisted of the calculation of means and SDs. Differences in 
demographic and biomechanical variables across groups were evaluated with analysis of 
variance. When significant differences were identified, post hoc testing was performed. 
Statistical significance was established at an alpha level of P < .05.
A cluster analytic technique, LPA, was used to examine whether participants could be 
grouped into distinct profiles based on a priori biomechanical characteristics during the tasks 
performed: ground-reaction force during the DVJ (GRF_DVJ), hip abduction moment 
during the SCD (HAdT_SCD), hip adduction moment maximum during the SCD 
(HipADD_SCD), hip adduction moment minimum during the SCD (HipM_SCD), hip 
adduction moment minimum during the DVJ (HipM_DVJ), and peak frontal-plane pelvis 
angle during the SCD (PelvisAng_SCD). LPA was implemented in Mplus version 5.16 The 
implementation of LPA was carried out in a stepwise fashion beginning with 2 profiles and 
then the number of profiles increasing by 1 at each step. Models with a successively 
increased number of profiles were compared using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) 
and adjusted for sample size. A lower BIC indicated a better model fit. The number of 
profiles was deemed adequate when no significant drop in the BIC was seen when the 
number of profiles was increased.
Other criteria to guide the decision on the optimal number of profiles include the Lo-
Mendell-Rubin adjusted likelihood ratio test,14 average posterior probability, entropy, and 
profile membership probabilities. The correlation between variables was accounted for in the 
analysis including hip adduction with both ground-reaction force and hip abduction moment. 
The validation of profile groups involved an examination of each group as an independent 
predictor of the KAM.

 Results
Among the initial cohort, 66 individuals did not make the team roster, posttest data only was 
available for 18 individuals, and 73 individuals were excluded from the analysis secondary 
to incomplete or bad data. This left 467 athletes whose data were available for analysis. As a 
group, the participants had a mean (±SD) age of 14 ± 1.8 years, mean height of 160 ± 8.1 
cm, mean weight of 55 ± 12 kg, and mean body mass index (BMI) of 21.2 ± 3.6 kg/m2. 
Maturation classification included 50.8% of the participants classified as pubertal stage, 
43.6% as postpubertal stage, and 5.6% as prepubertal stage. The majority of the athletes 
participated in basketball (48.8%), followed by volleyball (26.6%) and soccer (24.6%). The 
percentages of athletes from high schools versus middle schools were approximately the 
same: 49.0% versus 51.0%, respectively.
LPA resulted in 3 distinct risk profiles, which were defined as a low (profile 1), moderate 
(profile 2), and high (profile 3) risk for future ACL injuries. The profiles exhibited 
significant differences in age, pubertal stage, weight, height, and BMI (P < .05) (Table 1). 
Adjusted and unadjusted KAMs were significantly different during the DVJ between profiles 
1 and 2 and between profiles 1 and 3 (P < .05) (Table 1). Adjusted and unadjusted KAMs 
were significantly different during the SCD across all profiles (P < .05) (Table 1).
There were differences across groups for the biomechanical variables used to develop the 
risk profiles. There were significant differences across all groups for GRF_DVJ, 
HAdT_SCD, and HipADD_SCD (P < .05) (Table 2). There were significant differences 
between profiles 1 and 2 and between profiles 1 and 3 for HipM_DVJ (P < .05) (Table 2). 
There were also significant differences between profiles 1 and 3 and between profiles 2 and 
3 for PelvisAng_SCD (P < .05) (Table 2).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to use LPA to identify distinct profile groups of 
athletes using biomechanical landing data. This included 14% of the cohort classified as 
high risk, 72% as moderate risk, and 14% as low risk for future ACL injuries. LPA provided 
group separation using multiple combined movement analyses, and 3 distinct profiles were 
observed using peak trunk and hip biomechanical measures. Group differences in the peak 
KAM during the DVJ across the profiles were significant (profile 2 > profile 1 and profile 3 
> profile 1), whether unadjusted or adjusted for age and pubertal stage. Profile 1 was more 
likely to consist of younger and prepubertal athletes, while profile 3 was more likely to 
consist of older and postpubertal athletes.
Three distinct groups were identified with potentially disparate risks for ACL injuries. These 
results suggest that injury prevention strategies could be applied to female athletes who are 
at greatest risk for future injuries. Previously, Myer et al17 evaluated kinematics and kinetics 
during a DVJ test in 18 uninjured high school female athletes before and after a 7-week 
neuromuscular training program. Prediction of the ACL injury risk was calculated using the 
external KAM, with high risk defined as values exceeding 25.25 N·m and low risk defined 
as values below this point. Myer et al17 reported that athletes classified as high risk exhibited

 a decrease in their KAMs by 13% after training while low-risk athletes did not demonstrate 
any change in abduction moments. The authors also reported, however, that high-risk 
athletes who participated in neuro-muscular training did not reduce their KAMs to levels 
similar to the low-risk group.17 This prompted Myer et al17 to suggest that alterations in 
current neuromuscular training programs may be necessary for high-risk athletes to 
substantially decrease their ACL injury risk. The work of Myer et al17 was limited by the 
simple delineation of the future injury risk by using a single frontal-plane knee moment 
value to distinguish athlete groups. In the current investigation, a far more robust and 
sophisticated approach using LPA of several biomechanical movement characteristics was 
implemented to identify injury risk groups. This included trunk and hip biomechanics that 
are known to contribute to frontal-plane knee loads. The validation of low, moderate, and 
high injury risk groups was established by evaluating differences in frontal-plane knee 
loading. Results from the current investigation provide evidence to guide the selective 
implementation of prevention programs among athletes who are at greatest risk for future 
injuries as an effective utilization of time and resources.
For those patients who are classified as low risk, programs implemented as part of a team 
warm-up21 may be adequate. Alternatively, patients who are moderate or high risk may 
require supervised training with structured verbal and visual feedback18 as well as training 
that includes an emphasis on core and hip control.6 The effects of different types of ACL 
injury prevention programs across risk groups must, however, be assessed with future 
studies.
Neuromuscular deficits associated with an increased KAM appear to increase with age, and 
their increased prevalence largely coincides with the onset of maturation.10 Neuromuscular 
deficits associated with an increased KAM appear to increase with age, and their increased 
prevalence largely coincides with the onset of maturation. This investigation identified 
significant group differences in the peak KAM across profiles. Previous studies by Hewett et 
al10 and Ford et al7 demonstrated that the KAM increases with maturation. A high KAM is 
considered a significant marker of the risk for future injuries, as patients who later sustain an 
ACL injury have prospectively exhibited large frontal-plane knee loads.11 Further 
investigation is required to prospectively study the effects of each of these group profiles on 
the KAM and the ACL injury risk in both groups and individual patients.
In a laboratory setting, it can be challenging to both elicit and quantify the effects of the 
proximal influence on lower extremity stability. To overcome this challenge, the current 
study employed movement tasks that were designed to perturb both the knee and trunk. The 
double-leg DVJ is the most commonly reported task in the literature to assess dynamic lower 
extremity biomechanics in an athletic population. The task requires participants to drop off a 
31 cm–high box with both feet at the same time and, on landing, immediately perform a 
bilateral vertical jump with maximal effort. This center line movement largely ensures that 
the COM remains medial to both knee joint centers throughout the maneuver and typically 
does not elicit movement of the COM in the frontal plane relative to the knee joints. The 
task does, however, permit movement of the knees relative to the plantar surface of the feet. 
Hence, this movement elicits its primary perturbation to the knee bilaterally. The second 
task, the SCD, simultaneously requires synergistic control of both the knee and trunk. This

 task consists of a lateral hop from a box in which the participant lands on the limb opposite 
the initial stance leg. Lateral momentum of the COM during the SCD elicits trunk 
perturbation on landing and simultaneously challenges the lower extremity and hip 
musculature to maintain alignment of the knee over the stance foot. Hence, this movement 
elicits its primary perturbation to the bilateral knee joints and the trunk simultaneously. The 
third task, an SLD landing from a box, did not contribute to LPA for group development. 
The SLD landing permits movement of the trunk and pelvis but does not necessarily elicit 
these factors. Athletes must maintain alignment of their knee over their foot to successfully 
perform this task. Thus, the challenge to the lower extremity musculature makes this task 
particularly useful for identifying and eliciting asymmetries, particularly as measures of 
functional progress after injuries and ACL reconstruction. Hence, the SLD movement elicits 
its primary perturbation to the trunk only.
This study is not without limitations. This study established a biomechanical and 
neuromuscular rationale for distinguishing between athlete groups based on their risk for 
future ACL injuries. Validation of risk group profiles, however, will be necessary with a 
clinical trial. This study only assessed young female athletes. Furthermore, the effectiveness 
of a differential injury prevention approach based on the risk profile in the effects on 
reducing injury rates must also be assessed with a clinical trial. While it is well documented 
that female athletes who participate in jumping, cutting, and pivoting sports are at high risk 
for future ACL injuries, male athletes at risk for injuries may necessitate a distinct 
classification algorithm. This study utilized sophisticated methods to collect 3D 
biomechanical and neuromuscular characteristics for the development of risk groups. A 
correlate of the screening examination that is easy to administer and does not require 
expensive equipment will be necessary to translate the classification algorithm into clinical 
practice.
Conclusion
The findings of the current study suggest an alternative approach to ACL injury risk 
screening. The clustering of biomechanical and neuromuscular risk factors associated with 
an increased KAM and potential increased risk for ACL injuries indicates that there are 
select groupings of young female athletes who may benefit the most from preventive core 
stability–based intervention protocols. The findings also demonstrate that those young 
athletes undergoing and completing pubertal maturation are most likely to benefit from this 
training.
