Abstract 
2 
The capacity for some pathogens to jump into different host-species populations is a 
3 
major threat to public health and food security. Staphylococcus aureus is a multi-host 
4 
bacterial pathogen responsible for important human and livestock diseases. Here, using 
5 
a population genomic approach we identify humans as a major hub for ancient and 
6 
recent S. aureus host-switch events linked to the emergence of endemic livestock 
7 
strains, and cows as the main animal reservoir for the emergence of human epidemic 
8 
clones. Such host-species transitions are associated with horizontal acquisition of 
9 
genetic elements from host-specific gene pools conferring traits required for survival in 
10 
the new host-niche. Importantly, genes associated with antimicrobial resistance are 
11 
unevenly distributed among human and animal hosts reflecting distinct antibiotic usage 
12 
practices in medicine and agriculture. In addition to gene acquisition, genetic 
13 
diversification has occurred in pathways associated with nutrient acquisition, implying 
14 
metabolic remodeling after a host-switch in response to distinct nutrient availability. For 
15 
example, S. aureus from dairy cattle exhibit enhanced utilization of lactose, a major 
16 
source of carbohydrate in bovine milk. Overall, our findings highlight the influence of 
17 
human activities on the multi-host ecology of a major bacterial pathogen, underpinned 
18 
by horizontal gene transfer and core genome diversification.

Introduction 
1 
 
2 
Many bacterial pathogens are host specialists that co-evolve with a single host-species. 
3 
However, the capacity to switch host species can provide opportunities for expansion 
4 
into new host populations. The domestication of animals in the Neolithic period (10,000- 
5 
2,000 BC approximately) and the more recent intensification of livestock farming 
6 
provided increased opportunities for the movement of bacterial pathogens between 
7 
humans and animals1. Of note, the majority of emerging human infectious diseases 
8 
have been traced to an animal origin2. Staphylococcus aureus is associated with a wide 
9 
spectrum of diseases in humans and strains of both methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) and 
10 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are common causes of nosocomial and 
11 
community-acquired infection3,4. In addition, S. aureus causes an array of infections of 
12 
livestock that are a major burden on the agricultural industry, including mastitis in cows, 
13 
sheep and goats 5,6, septicemia and skeletal infections in commercial broiler chickens7, 
14 
exudative epidermitis in pigs8 and skin abscesses and mastitis in rabbits9. 
15 
 
16 
S. aureus has a clonal population structure defined by a relatively low level of 
17 
recombination, comprised of lineages that have single or multiple host-tropisms10-12. 
18 
Inter-host species transmission can be of critical public health importance, as 
19 
exemplified by the livestock-associated methicillin-resistant clonal complex (CC) 398, 
20 
which is associated with pigs and other livestock, but can cause zoonotic infections of 
21 
pig-farmers and their contacts13,14. Previous work employed multi-locus sequence typing 
22 
(MLST) to provide evidence for the occurrence of host-jump events from humans 
23 
  
4 
leading to the emergence of S. aureus clones in livestock populations11,12. More 
1 
recently, whole genome sequencing has been employed to investigate the evolution of 
2 
individual clones, providing insights into the emergence, transmission and acquisition of 
3 
antibiotic resistance in hospital, community, and agricultural settings13,15-17. In addition, a 
4 
role for specific mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and core gene mutations in the host-
5 
adaptation of S. aureus has been identified 9,18,19. For example, the major porcine and 
6 
avian clones of S. aureus likely originated in humans and the host-jumps were 
7 
associated with acquisition of MGE not found among human isolates 13,18. Similarly, the 
8 
major S. aureus clone associated with sheep and goats evolved through a combination 
9 
of gene acquisition, and allelic diversification including loss of gene function20. 
10 
Furthermore, several studies have reported the host-specific functional activity of S. 
11 
aureus effectors such as leucocidins, superantigens, and the von Willebrand factor-
12 
binding protein 21-26. In addition, it was demonstrated that for S. aureus strains 
13 
associated with natural infections of rabbits, a single mutation was responsible for 
14 
conferring infectivity to the progenitor strain found in human populations9. Taken 
15 
together, these studies highlight the capacity for bacteria to undergo host-switching 
16 
events and adapt to different species by multiple evolutionary genetic and functional 
17 
mechanisms. However, a large-scale, genome-based analysis of the evolutionary 
18 
history of S. aureus in the context of its host ecology is lacking, and the scale and 
19 
molecular basis of host-switching events remains poorly understood.  
20 
 
21 
Here, we carry out a population genomic analysis of over 800 S. aureus isolates 
22 
selected to represent the known breadth of host-species diversity in order to provide a 
23 
  
5 
high-resolution picture of the dynamics of S. aureus in the context of its host. The data 
1 
reveal the impact of human activities such as domestication and the use of antibiotics in 
2 
medicine and agriculture on the recent evolution of S. aureus, and identify the key 
3 
evolutionary processes underpinning its multi-host species ecology.

Results 
1 
Extensive host-switching events define the evolutionary history of S. aureus. 
2 
We selected S. aureus strains to represent the breadth of the known clonal, geographic, 
3 
and host-species diversity (Isolate selection details in Methods section). Overall, we 
4 
included 800 isolates representative of 43 different host species, 77 clonal complexes 
5 
(CCs), isolated in 50 different countries across 5 continents (Supplementary Figure 1-3; 
6 
Supplementary Table 1). Among the 800 isolates, a total of 115,149 SNPs were 
7 
identified in a core genome of 711,562 bp and used for reconstruction of the maximum-
8 
likelihood (ML) phylogeny for the S. aureus species (Fig. 1). The S. aureus species tree 
9 
indicates the existence of highly divergent clades representative of the recently-
10 
described Staphylococcus argenteus and Staphylococcus schweitzeri species which 
11 
belong to the extended S. aureus-related complex (Fig. 1a)27. S. argenteus, an 
12 
emerging cause of human clinical infection28, is more closely related to bat and monkey 
13 
isolates than to other human S. aureus sequence types (STs), consistent with a 
14 
possible non-human evolutionary origin for S. argenteus. Removal of isolates from the 
15 
divergent clades resulted in a phylogeny of 783 isolates that segregated according to 
16 
clonal complexes defined by MLST (Fig. 1b). The phylogeny indicates the broad 
17 
diversity of isolates of human origin with expansion of several successful epidemic 
18 
hospital and community-associated clones including CC22, CC30, and ST45, as 
19 
previously described29 (Fig. 1). Animal isolates are typically found in discrete host-
20 
specific clades interspersed among human lineages, consistent with ancient and recent 
21 
host-switching events across the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). In order to examine the 
22 
frequency and timing of host-switching events during the evolution of S. aureus, we 
23 
  
7 
employed Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST) using substitution 
1 
rates from published datasets (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 2). We estimated the 
2 
number of cross-species transmissions for 10 major host categories (Supplementary 
3 
Table 3, Supplementary Figures 2-5) using BEAST with Markov Jumps30. In order to 
4 
reduce bias caused by the larger numbers of sequences from human and cow hosts 
5 
compared to the other host types we used 10 stratified subsamples containing 252 
6 
sequences each, designed to maintain geographic, host-type and temporal diversity 
7 
while reducing over-representation. To assess the robustness of the main analysis, we 
8 
performed additional analyses as outlined in Supplementary Material (Supplementary 
9 
Notes; Supplementary Figures 4-11; Supplementary Tables 4-5), that included â€˜severe 
10 
balancedâ€™ subsamples of 97 taxa each containing 18-20 taxa of 5 host-types, and 
11 
ancestral state and host-jumps using the BASTA approximation to the structured 
12 
coalescent31. However, we had difficulty in getting BASTA to run and converge possibly 
13 
due to its assumptions about the structure of the data and numerical instability. Each 
14 
subsampled sequence set was analyzed separately within BEAST and resulted in a 
15 
collection of posterior trees per dataset (Supplementary Figures 6-10). In each case, the 
16 
analysis revealed extensive host-switching events that occurred over a time-frame 
17 
spanning several thousand years up to the present decade (Fig. 2a). 
18 
 
19 
Our analysis identifies humans as a major donor with host-jumps identified from 
20 
humans into all other host-species groups examined (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Figure 4). 
21 
The most common recipient for S. aureus jumps from humans was cows with a median 
22 
of 14 jumps (HPD 3-22) between the years -2000 and 2012. Cows also represented a 
23 
major donor for host-switching events back into humans (n=10; HPD 2-26). In addition, 
24 
  
8 
there were numerous S. aureus host-switches among ruminants, particularly between 
1 
cattle and goats in both directions and into sheep. However, host jumps from sheep into 
2 
other species are rare and not strongly supported by our analyses suggesting that 
3 
although a common host for S. aureus 5, sheep do not represent a major reservoir for 
4 
the spread of S. aureus to other animals.  
5 
  
6 
Host-specific accessory gene pools promote adaptive evolution after host-
7 
switching events. In order to investigate the distribution of MGEs on a population level 
8 
across human and animal isolates, we employed a pangenome-wide association 
9 
analysis approach to identify genes that were enriched among isolates from specific 
10 
host-species. First, to account for phylogeny we removed genes identified among all 
11 
strains within clonal complexes associated with multiple host-species (lineage-
12 
dependent genes). Network analysis indicated a remarkable correlation between 
13 
accessory genome and host-species revealing that diverse clonal complexes can share 
14 
highly similar accessory genomes that are specific for birds, pigs or horses, 
15 
respectively. This strongly points to the existence of a host-specific gene pool required 
16 
for S. aureus host-adaptation. Although accessory genomes of S. aureus obtained from 
17 
humans, and from cows, sheep and goats also tended to cluster together in a host-
18 
specific manner, there was greater diversity in gene content (Fig. 3). This may reflect 
19 
the existence of multiple cryptic niches that exist within a single host-species such as 
20 
those proposed previously for Campylobacter jejuni 32. We note the existence of a small 
21 
number of clusters made of isolates from multiple host-species. The existence of these 
22 
clusters suggests that some accessory gene combinations may confer a more 
23 
  
9 
generalist host tropism with the capacity to infect multiple host-species. Alternatively, 
1 
insufficient time may have passed since the host-transition event for loss of dispensable 
2 
MGE to occur. Of note, antibiotic resistance gene determinants influenced the clustering 
3 
of equine and pig isolates suggesting a role for acquisition of resistance in host-
4 
adaptation (Supplementary Figure 12). 
5 
 
6 
Further examination of the impact of the accessory genome on successful host-
7 
switching events was carried out by identifying gene acquisition or loss events that 
8 
correlated with host-switching events identified on the phylogeny of S. aureus. A total of 
9 
36 distinct MGEs including predicted plasmids, transposons, S. aureus Pathogenicity 
10 
Islands (SaPIs) and prophages were identified to be associated with host-switch events 
11 
(p< 0.0001) (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 6). Several of the MGEs have previously 
12 
been identified and demonstrated to encode proteins with host-specific activity. For 
13 
example, the Î²-converting phage Ï•Sa3 encodes modulators of the human innate 
14 
immune response, and pathogenicity islands encode superantigens or von Willebrand 
15 
factor-binding proteins with ruminant-specific activity 19,33. In addition, equine isolates 
16 
contain a phage encoding a novel equine allele of the staphylococcal inhibitor of 
17 
complement (scn) which also encodes the LukP/Q toxin, recently characterized to have 
18 
equine-specific activity22,25. However, numerous uncharacterized MGEs have been 
19 
identified in the current study to be linked to successful host-switch events providing 
20 
many novel avenues for characterizing the molecular basis of S. aureus host-adaptation 
21 
(Fig 4b). For example, in isolates from pigs, a putative novel plasmid linked to SCCmec 
22 
encoding resistance to heavy metal ions, a common supplement in pig-feed, was linked 
23 
  
10 
to host-switching events from humans into pigs (Fig. 4b). Finally, several gene clusters 
1 
encoding bacterocins were enriched in isolates from specific host-species (p< 0.0001) 
2 
or were linked to host-switching events (p<0.0001), consistent with the need to compete 
3 
with resident bacteria for survival (Supplementary Table 6). Taken together, these data 
4 
suggest that successful host-switch events are associated with acquisition of MGEs 
5 
from an accessory gene pool that exists in the recipient host-species, and/or loss of 
6 
MGEs linked to the source species. 
7 
 
8 
In order to investigate the potential origin of MGEs horizontally acquired after a host-
9 
switch event, we examined the codon usage bias of host-specific MGE, and found that 
10 
MGEs enriched in pig isolates had significantly elevated %GC content and reduced 
11 
codon adaptive index (CAI) indicative of a distinct genealogical origin (Supplementary 
12 
Figures 13-15). Of note, an MGE found in pig isolates had highest BLASTn similarity to 
13 
a putative pathogenicity island previously identified in the pig-associated zoonotic 
14 
pathogen Streptococcus suis (GC content of ~41%) (Supplementary Table 6). 
15 
 
16 
Both gain and loss of gene function are associated with S. aureus host-
17 
adaptation. Determination of the number of predicted functional genes in each S. 
18 
aureus genome identified a significantly higher number of genes in bird strains 
19 
compared to S. aureus from any other host-species (Supplementary Figures 16-17).  
20 
In contrast, the number of pseudogenes per genome is significantly higher (p<0.0001-
21 
0.02) in ruminant strains compared to those from other host-species suggesting that the 
22 
niche occupied by S. aureus in cows may provide stronger selection for loss of gene 
23 
  
11 
function compared to the niches for S. aureus in birds and pigs. Numerous 
1 
pseudogenes associated with transport of nutrients in S. aureus including 
2 
carbohydrates, are over-represented in ruminant isolates implying metabolic remodeling 
3 
in response to distinct nutrient availabilities in the bovine niche (Supplementary Table 
4 
8).  
5 
 
6 
Refinement of host adaptation involves modification of biological pathways in 
7 
response to nutrient availability. In addition to accessory genes, adaptive mutations 
8 
in the core genome may be selected for in response to environmental changes such as 
9 
antibiotic exposure or a switch in host-species 9,34. In order to examine the impact of 
10 
host-species on diversification of the S. aureus core genome, we identified groups of 
11 
related isolates (e.g. within CCs or STs) associated with a specific host-species for 
12 
genome-wide analysis of positive selection (Supplementary Table 9; Supplementary 
13 
Figure 18). Positive selection was identified across all host-associated groups 
14 
examined, with an average of 68 genes (33 to 129) representing approximately 2.7% 
15 
(1.3% to 5.1%) of a clade-specific core genome (Supplementary Table 10). A limited 
16 
number of genes were under diversifying selection across multiple host species, 
17 
including several that encode membrane proteins, lipoproteins and a protein involved in 
18 
biofilm formation. Some genes were identified as undergoing positive selection in 
19 
distinct lineages that were associated with the same host-species (mostly human), 
20 
suggesting strong selective pressure leading to convergent evolution. However, for the 
21 
most part, our analysis detected distinct sets of genes under positive selection in 
22 
different lineages, suggesting that signatures of host-adaptation are dependent on the 
23 
  
12 
genetic background of the strain, and that host-adaptation can occur via multiple 
1 
trajectories involving modification of distinct pathways. 
2 
 
3 
We predicted functional categories of genes under positive selection and the biological 
4 
pathways affected revealing several functional groups that were enriched for positively 
5 
selected genes independently of the host species including genes linked to 
6 
pathogenesis, immune evasion and maintenance of MGEs ((Supplementary Table 11; 
7 
Supplementary Figure 19). However, the majority of the functional categories were host-
8 
species dependent, consistent with distinct mechanisms underpinning adaptation to 
9 
different host-species (Supplementary Table 11; summarized Fig. 5). In particular, 
10 
biological pathways associated with amino acid metabolism and iron acquisition were 
11 
under positive selection in several host-species suggesting diversification in response to 
12 
distinct nutrient availability in different host niches. In addition, genes associated with 
13 
transport and metabolism of carbohydrates demonstrated signatures of positive 
14 
selection in S. aureus clones from humans and cows (Fig. 5).  
15 
 
16 
Bovine S. aureus strains utilize lactose with higher efficiency compared to human 
17 
or avian strains. Considering the signatures of positive selection identified among 
18 
pathways associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, we investigated 
19 
differences in growth phenotype of selected host-specific S. aureus strains using a 
20 
metabolic phenotype microarray (Biolog), and observed preliminary strain-dependent 
21 
differences in growth that were influenced by the availability of specific amino acids or 
22 
carbohydrates. For example, S. aureus strains from cows had higher relative growth in 
23 
  
13 
the presence of lactose, the primary disaccharide available in bovine milk. The genome-
1 
wide positive selection analysis indicated that in bovine strains, genes associated with 
2 
the functional category of transport of disaccharides and oligosaccharides were 
3 
impacted by positive selection. To further investigate this, we carried out phenotypic 
4 
analysis of S. aureus strains from bovine, human and avian host- species of different 
5 
clonal complexes when grown in the presence of lactose (Fig. 5e). As lactic acid is 
6 
produced by S. aureus as a by-product of fermentation, we measured pH levels in 
7 
culture media containing lactose and identified a decrease in pH levels for bovine S. 
8 
aureus clones in comparison to human or avian clones, consistent with increased 
9 
efficiency of fermentation of lactose (Fig. 5f). These data support the concept that S. 
10 
aureus undergoes genetic diversification in response to the nutrients that differ in 
11 
availability in different niches. 
12 
 
13 
Resistance to antimicrobials differs among human and pig S. aureus. Our 
14 
understanding of the relative contribution of the use of antibiotics in human medicine 
15 
and agriculture to the emergence of antibiotic resistance is very limited. To address this 
16 
question for the model human and animal pathogen S. aureus, we examined the 
17 
distribution of antibiotic, antiseptic and heavy metal-ion resistance determinants among 
18 
human and livestock isolates, and then accounted for phylogenetic relatedness for  
19 
resistance to different classes of antibiotic (Supplementary Table 12). An array of 
20 
resistance determinants were significantly enriched in human, ruminant, and pig 
21 
isolates, respectively, but not among avian isolates, consistent with a limited role for the 
22 
poultry industry in the emergence of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus.(Fig. 6; Table 
23 
  
14 
S12). When testing for phylogenetic independence, we aimed to maximize statistical 
1 
power by including all gene determinants into groups specific for each class of 
2 
antimicrobial, and also examined selected individual determinants str and sdrM. The 
3 
analysis indicated that resistance to streptomycin, antiseptics, and tetracyclines were all 
4 
significantly associated with pig isolates, whereas sdrM was  
5 
enriched in human isolates. However, fluoroquinolone and heavy metal ion resistance 
6 
did not correlate with hosts after correction for phylogeny implying that expansion of 
7 
specific clones has contributed to the high frequency of those resistance determinants 
8 
among human and pig hosts, respectively. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 
9 
resistance to specific classes of antimicrobial in S. aureus is host species-dependent 
10 
providing evidence for distinct antibiotic selective pressures in humans and livestock. Of 
11 
note tetracyclines, and aminoglycosides (such as streptomycin) are used in much 
12 
higher amounts in farmed animals compared to human medicine 35. Zoonotic 
13 
transmission of S. aureus is a relatively common occurrence for some clones, 
14 
particularly between pigs and humans in the case of CC398, providing a route for the 
15 
transmission of resistant strains and associated resistance determinants to humans36.  
16 
 
17 
Discussion 
18 
 
19 
Many new pathogens emerge following zoonotic or anthroponotic events providing the 
20 
opportunity for spread within a new host population2. S. aureus is considered a 
21 
generalist bacterial species, capable of colonizing a wide range of hosts5. However, the 
22 
species is composed of distinct sub-lineages that are commonly associated with 
23 
  
15 
particular hosts or host groups10,14. Accordingly, S. aureus represents an excellent 
1 
model to explore the dynamics of a bacterial pathogen at the human-animal interface. 
2 
Here, we demonstrate that the segregated host-specialism of S. aureus arose via 
3 
multiple cross-species transmission events that occurred over the last 5,000-6,000 
4 
years, leading to the emergence of successful endemic and epidemic clones circulating 
5 
in distinct host-species populations. We identify humans as a major reservoir for the 
6 
spread of S. aureus to livestock, reflecting the role of humans in domestication of 
7 
animals, and subsequent opportunities for cross-species transmission events consistent 
8 
with analysis using MLST12. Importantly, we also identify cows as the main animal 
9 
source for the emergence of S. aureus clones that are epidemic in human populations 
10 
consistent with a previous study that identified a bovine origin for emergent CC97 
11 
clones causing human infections across multiple continents17.  
12 
 
13 
The identification of combinations of MGEs that are associated with specific host-
14 
species and linked to host-switching events provides compelling evidence for the key 
15 
role of horizontal gene acquisition in the adaptation of S. aureus to their hosts. While 
16 
several MGEs have been identified to be associated with host-specific clones18,19,22,24, 
17 
our species-wide analysis reveals combinations of MGEs linked to specific host species 
18 
providing many new avenues for investigating mechanisms of bacterial host-adaptation. 
19 
Overall, the data suggest that host-specific accessory gene pools presumably present in 
20 
the microbiota of the new host-species promote the host-adaptive evolution of S. 
21 
aureus. 
22 
 
23 
  
16 
In addition to gene acquisition associated with host-switch events, we identified 
1 
evidence of adaptive evolution in the core genome consistent with host-specific 
2 
selective pressure driving the diversification of biological pathways that are involved in 
3 
survival or transmission. Furthermore, in some cases, distinct pathways were under 
4 
positive selective pressure in different clones associated with the same host-species, 
5 
implying that multiple distinct pathways may mediate host-adaptation depending on the 
6 
genetic background of the strain. In particular, pathways linked to carbohydrate 
7 
transport exhibited signatures of host-adaptation and phenotypic analysis revealed 
8 
enhanced utilization by bovine S. aureus clones of the disaccharide lactose, the major 
9 
carbohydrate available in bovine milk.  
10 
 
11 
These findings inform a model of S. aureus host-adaptation in which acquisition of a 
12 
specific set of MGEs occur rapidly after a host-switch event (although we canâ€™t rule out 
13 
this could occur prior to the jump in some cases), conferring the capacity for survival in 
14 
the new host, largely through targeting of the innate immune response via bacterial 
15 
effectors such as leukocidins, superantigens and other immune-modulators. Other 
16 
MGEs confer resistance to antibiotics and heavy metal ions allowing survival under 
17 
strong anti-microbial selective pressures. Subsequently, positive selection acts on the 
18 
core genome via point mutation and/or recombination 37 causing allelic variation and 
19 
loss of gene function that results in modification of metabolism in response to distinct 
20 
nutrient availability. 
21 
 
22 
  
17 
Our findings suggest that since human-driven domestication, interactions with livestock 
1 
have provided opportunities for numerous successful host-switch events between 
2 
humans and livestock hosts. Further, industrialization of agriculture including use of 
3 
antibiotics and feed supplements in intensive farming have directly influenced the 
4 
evolution of S. aureus clones resulting in the emergence of resistance in response to 
5 
distinct antibiotic selective pressures in human medicine and agriculture18,38. These data 
6 
support the idea that surveillance could play a critical role in the early identification of 
7 
emerging clones that have jumped host. 
8 
 
9 
Taken together, our data provide a high-resolution view of the capacity for a model 
10 
multi-host pathogen to undergo radical changes in host ecology by genetic adaptation. 
11 
Investigation into the functional basis of these genetic changes will reveal key host-
12 
pathogen interactions that could be targeted for novel therapies. Further, the 
13 
identification of the common routes for S. aureus livestock-human host-species 
14 
switches and distinct types of antimicrobial resistance in humans and livestock species 
15 
could inform the design of more effective farm security and antibiotic treatment practices 
16 
to limit the emergence of new resistant clones. These findings will be relevant to other 
17 
major bacterial pathogens with the capacity to spread between livestock and humans.

Methods 
20 
 
21 
Isolate selection. For selection of isolates, the literature was reviewed (date: 
22 
November 2013) and all available S. aureus strains associated with animals and 
23 
  
18 
humans for which genomes had been determined were identified. We aimed to include 
1 
isolates to represent the breadth of clonal complexes, host-species diversity, 
2 
geographical locations and as wide a temporal scale as possible (Supplementary 
3 
Tables 1-3).  Publicly available sequences were selected as follows; 74 reference 
4 
genomes, 302 from the EARSS project29, and 252 from other published studies of the 
5 
authors (Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, to be as representative of the known S. 
6 
aureus host, clonal, and geographic diversity as possible we selected an additional 172 
7 
isolates for whole genome sequencing (Supplementary Table 1). Our dataset is biased 
8 
towards human isolates which represent approximately 60% of the total with 40% 
9 
approximately from animal sources. This reflects that fact that much of the known 
10 
diversity of the S. aureus species is of human origin12, and also that fewer number of 
11 
isolates that have been obtained from animals. Given the predominant European origin 
12 
of the animal isolates (due to the contemporary interest in animal S. aureus in Europe), 
13 
we chose to enrich the number of human isolates with the EARSS collection 
14 
representative of the diversity of invasive S. aureus circulating among humans in 
15 
Europe in 200629. Accordingly, there is a European bias to the sample dataset and we 
16 
canâ€™t rule out that we have under-sampled the S. aureus diversity that exists in other 
17 
parts of the world. Nonetheless, our dataset contained isolates from 50 different 
18 
countries across 5 continents and many sequence types are widely distributed on an 
19 
intercontinental scale. In addition, our dataset includes isolates from the years 1930 to 
20 
2014, although the majority have been isolated since 2005 reflecting the greater 
21 
availability of recent clinical isolates (particularly from animals). It should therefore also 
22 
be considered that the dataset is biased towards contemporary S. aureus and that older 
23 
  
19 
lineages that are now less abundant or extinct may not be represented in our dataset. In 
1 
order to partially address the uneven distributions of isolates by host, space and time, 
2 
where appropriate, we have carried out experimental replicates based on severe 
3 
subsampling of the dataset that provide more evenly distributed groups. In addition, we 
4 
have drawn conclusions that are consistent across subsampled data and, when 
5 
appropriate, multiple different analytic approaches. Overall, we included 800 isolates 
6 
representative of 43 different host species and 77 clonal complexes (CCs), isolated in 
7 
50 different countries across 5 continents (Supplementary Table 1). All sequences and 
8 
associated metadata have been uploaded to Microreact a publicly accessible database 
9 
that allows visualization and analysis of the data https://microreact.org/project/shacdata 
10 
39. 
11 
  
12 
Sequencing, genome assemblies, variant calling and phylogenetic 
13 
reconstruction. For the current study, bacterial DNA was extracted and sequenced 
14 
using Illumina HiSeq2000 with 100-cycle paired-end runs at the Wellcome Trust Sanger 
15 
Institute or Illumina HiSeq2000 at Edinburgh Genomics. The nucleotide sequence data 
16 
were submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) with the 
17 
accession numbers listed in Supplementary Table 1. Completed genomes downloaded 
18 
from the NCBI database were converted into pseudo-fastq files using Wgsim 
19 
(https://github.com/lh3/wgsim). For each isolate the sequence reads were used to 
20 
create multiple assemblies using VelvetOptimiser v2.2.540 and Velvet v1.241. The 
21 
assemblies were improved by scaffolding the best N50 and contigs using SSPACE42 
22 
and sequence gaps filled using GapFiller43. Isolates were excluded from the analysis for 
23 
  
20 
the following reasons that are indicative of contamination or poor quality sequence data; 
1 
a large number of contigs and a large number of â€˜Nâ€™s in the assemblies or large genome 
2 
size (>2.9 Mb). Sequence types were determined from the assemblies using MLST 
3 
check (https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/mlst_check), which was used to compare 
4 
the assembled genomes against the MLST database for S. aureus 
5 
(http://pubmlst.org/saureus/). Sequence reads were mapped to a relevant reference 
6 
genome (European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) ST425 (strain LGA251, accession 
7 
number FR821779), using SMALT (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/smalt-0) 
8 
following the default settings to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). 
9 
Consensus sequences were obtained using samtools and concatenated into core 
10 
genome alignments44. SNPs located in mobile genetic elements were removed from the 
11 
alignments and a maximum likelihood tree was constructed using RAxML following 
12 
default settings and 1000 bootstrap replicates45.  
13 
  
14 
Time scaled trees and estimation of the number of host jumps. Time scaled trees 
15 
were generated using BEAST 1.8.246. All isolates with unknown date, unknown host 
16 
species or unknown geographical location were removed in addition to the diverse 
17 
BAPs groups 12 and 14 leaving a total of 696 isolates. Sites determined to be affected 
18 
by recombination from the BNG analysis of the individual BAPs groups, were coded as 
19 
missing data. Since missing data can effect phylogenetic inference and contribute to 
20 
heavy likelihood calculations, sites that had more than one missing state in the 
21 
alignment (either from missing mapped reads or recombination) were excluded from 
22 
further analyses, leaving a total of 55,778 sites (4306 segregating sites). 
23 
  
21 
 To account for different evolutionary processes acting at synonymous and non-
1 
synonymous sites, RNA and noncoding sites, the evolutionary model was partitioned in 
2 
to 1+2nd sites, 3rd sites, non-coding sites, and RNAs according to the reference strain 
3 
LGA251. Pseudogenes were partitioned in to 1+2nd and 3rd sites with the rationale that 
4 
they may be functional in other isolates. For overlapping reading frames, sites were 
5 
assigned to the region of highest constraint (e.g. when coding and RNA, sites assigned 
6 
as RNA, when 1st and 3rd, sites assigned as 1+2nd etc.). For all partitions, we used an 
7 
HKY + Î“ substitution model. 
8 
  
9 
Dating. We treated all sequences as contemporaneous but assigned a median prior of 
10 
1.61 [0.604, 2.9] substitutions per site per million years on to 3rd positions, which are 
11 
less likely to be subject to strong purifying selection (known to affect rates over different 
12 
timescales). The prior comes from previous studies of S. aureus using tip dates on 
13 
different strain types (Supplementary Table 3). An uncorrelated lognormal model of 
14 
changes in substitution rate across different branches was employed. An initial MCMC 
15 
run with this model was performed in BEAST v1.8.246 using Beagle47 with two 
16 
independent chains, removing the appropriate burnin and run for approximately 
17 
100,000,000 generations. 
18 
In addition, a 10 further subsampled datasets were produced that included only 
19 
sequences from the 10 major host types. These were stratified subsamples containing 
20 
252 samples each, designed to maintain the host species, geographic and temporal 
21 
diversity. The major hosts types are birds, cows, goats, carnivores, horses, humans, 
22 
  
22 
rabbits, sheep, rodents and pigs. From these analyses, we subsampled an empirical 
1 
distribution of 1000 trees post burnin which were used for all further BEAST analyses. 
2 
  
3 
Markov Jump analysis. In order to reconstruct host transition events, we used an 
4 
asymmetric discrete state phylogeographic analysis with Markov Jumps (REF: 51) 
5 
applied to the 10 major host types with default priors. We employed the Markov jump 
6 
analysis to estimate the posterior expectation of the number of host change events 
7 
across the branches of the phylogeny30, using posterior sets of 1000 time scaled trees 
8 
from the initial BEAST analyses on the subsampled data sets. The trait models were 
9 
used in an MCMC chain of 1,100,000 steps, sampling every 100 steps and discarding 
10 
the first 10% as burn-in, leaving 10,000 trees annotated with the host information (i.e. 
11 
approximately 10 model instances per tree of the original posterior set). Since biased 
12 
sampling can lead to biased results when using these trait models, in addition to using 
13 
the 10 stratified subsamples of 252 sequences each we performed additional analyses 
14 
with host state randomization and using 100 bootstrapped maximum likelihood trees 
15 
(RAxML) in place of the 1000 original BEAST trees (for the 10 stratified subsamples) To 
16 
balance the numbers of isolates per host category further, we also created 10 â€˜severeâ€™ 
17 
stratified subsamples containing 97 sequences each with 20 from Humans, Cows and 
18 
Sheep+Goats combined and 19 and 18 from Birds and Pigs respectively. Necessarily in 
19 
these severe subsamples it was not possible to maintain the full human and cattle 
20 
diversity, although sequences from different geographic locations and years were 
21 
chosen. We applied BEAST with Markov Jumps on these 5 host categories using: full 
22 
joint inference of trees using sequences and traits together; trees using the sequences 
23 
  
23 
only followed by the trait mapping as before; and the BASTA structured coalescent 
1 
approximation 31. 
2 
 
3 
Pseudogene analysis. Pseudogenes were predicted during the PROKKA annotation 
4 
process48. Specifically, each protein in a genome was searched against UniProtKB 
5 
(Swiss-Prot) using BLASTp49 or UniProtKB (TrEMBL). If no significant hits were 
6 
identified, proteins were examined for conserved motifs. Any proteins exhibited less 
7 
than 95% coverage of their top hit were listed as potential pseudogenes. The region of 
8 
the top hit that was not present in the protein sequence was then interrogated against 
9 
all contigs using BLASTn49. Hits that were in the correct orientation and on the same 
10 
contigs were accepted as pseudogenes and labelled according to their type (frameshift, 
11 
stop codon, insertion). Proteins that were less 95% coverage of their top hit and on the 
12 
edge of a contig with their counterpart on another contigs were not labelled as 
13 
pseudogenes, rather CDS that have split due to the assembly breaking at this point. 
14 
 
15 
The UniProt ID Mapping tool was used to assign Gene ontology (GO) terms to all 
16 
pseudogenes by transferring the GO terms assigned to the closest reference (identified 
17 
during the annotation process described above). GO was assigned to all non-
18 
pseudogenes (CDS features) using the same method and InterProScan50. The R 
19 
package topGO51 with Fisherâ€™s exact test was used to identify enriched GO terms whilst 
20 
taking into account the GO hierarchy (the p-value was adjusted using Bonferroni 
21 
correction). 
22 
     
     
     
 
23 
  
24 
Pan-genome association analysis. All genomes in this study were organised into a list 
1 
of reference genomes followed by assembled contigs. The second genome in the list 
2 
was aligned to the first genome using Nucmer52 and any regions larger than 100 bp that 
3 
did not map to the first genome were appended to the end of it to produce a pangenome 
4 
representing the unique regions in the first two genomes. Each subsequent genome 
5 
aligned to the combination of all unique regions from the previously aligned genomes in 
6 
the list producing a pangenome that represents all of the nucleotide sequences of all 
7 
genomes. All genes were organised into groups of orthologues using the bi-directional 
8 
best hits algorithm in Get_homologues with a minimum coverage setting of 50% and 
9 
minimum sequence identity setting of 80%53. The pangenome was used as the 
10 
reference and the coding sequences (CDS) predicted in the annotations described 
11 
previously were compared to all CDS within the pangenome. Features annotated as 
12 
pseudogenes were excluded from this analysis. The Get_homologues 
13 
compare_clusters perl script was used to create a pangenome matrix of all identified 
14 
gene clusters against all genomes. All core gene clusters (clusters that contain genes 
15 
from every genome) were removed from the pangenome matrix. Further to this all 
16 
clusters that only contained genes from one genome or all genomes except one were 
17 
removed. Furthermore, gene clusters that were found in all members of any STs 
18 
associated with multiple host species were removed on the basis that they are not 
19 
specific to a single host species. This has the effect of removing lineage-associated 
20 
genes resulting in a set of gene clusters that are strain-dependent and largely 
21 
independent of phylogeny. Hypergeometric testing was used to find over- and under- 
22 
represented gene clusters for each host (the p-value was adjusted using Bonferroni 
23 
  
25 
correction). All gene clusters were searched against the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide 
1 
database using blastn to provide the most up to date annotation and to examine the 
2 
likely bacterial species origin of each MGE. 
3 
 
4 
A pairwise distance matrix was calculated from the pangenome matrix using the distmat 
5 
function in EMBOSS54. The matrix was converted into a bidirectional graph with 
6 
distance as the edge weight parameter. The graph was processed in BioLayout with an 
7 
edge weight threshold of 0.555.  
8 
  
9 
Identification of gene acquisitions or losses associated with host-switching 
10 
events. The R package APE (Analysis of Phylogenetics and Evolution)56 was used to fit 
11 
a single discrete trait model and get the ancestral state of each node for each gene 
12 
cluster against the phylogenetic tree. From this, a vector for every gene cluster was 
13 
created with gene acquisition/loss events by comparing every child node in the tree to 
14 
its parent node to determine if there was no change, a gene acquisition or a gene loss 
15 
event. This was performed separately for each host type (i.e. human, ruminant, bird, 
16 
horse and pig) to identify which nodes are associated with a host-switching event. All 
17 
gene state vectors were compared to all host state vectors using a Fisherâ€™s exact test to 
18 
show whether a gene loss/acquisition even is related to a host switch event. The p-
19 
values were adjusted using Bonferroni correction. 
20 
  
21 
Codon usage bias analysis. The codon adaptation index is used to calculate codon 
22 
usage bias by comparing the CAI of a gene against the codon usage table of a 
23 
  
26 
reference set of genes. The codon usage table was calculated using the EMBOSS tool 
1 
cusp54. For this study, the codon usage table was comprised of all genes that were not 
2 
significantly over represented in a host or significantly associated with a host switch. 
3 
The codon adaptation index (CAI) for all genes significantly over represented in a host 
4 
and significantly associated with a host jump was calculated using the EMBOSS tool 
5 
cai54. The codon adaptation index was also calculated using five random subsets of 50 
6 
genes as controls. A one-way ANOVA test was used to test whether there was a 
7 
significant effect of host upon CAI. A Tukey HSD test was then applied to compare the 
8 
CAIs between host species. 
9 
 
10 
Distribution of antibiotic resistance genes analysis. Antimicrobial resistance genes 
11 
were identified as described by Holden et al15. Resistance genes were identified by a 
12 
combination of BlastN and mapping against assemblies and as previously described 57 
13 
and resistance SNPs identified by mapping against a pseudomolecule of genes with 
14 
previously reported resistance-conferring mutations. Isolates were grouped into human 
15 
isolates and all animals and them human, rabbits, companion animals (horses, dogs, 
16 
cats), marine, pigs, primates, ruminants (goats, sheep, cows) and small mammals (rats, 
17 
mice, other small mammals). The proportions of isolates with each resistance gene and 
18 
â‰¥1 resistance conferring SNP for each antibiotic was compared to identify enrichment 
19 
using a two-tailed Fishers Exact test with a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. 
20 
Determinates with a P value <9.9 x 10-5 were considered statistically significantly 
21 
enriched. To examine whether the Fisher Exact tests of independence were robust 
22 
when accounting for population structure, we tested whether resistance phenotypes and 
23 
  
27 
host were correlated across the S. aureus phylogeny. We conducted these for 
1 
pig/human and ruminant/human since these were the only comparisons where 
2 
significant differences were observed according to the Fisherâ€™s exact test. In order to 
3 
maximise statistical power, we grouped all gene determinants into specific classes of 
4 
antimicrobial (e.g. Tetracycline-resistant if encoding any tet allele) and tested for 
5 
correlation with host species using the program BayesTraits58 (using the posterior 
6 
sample of trees from our earlier BEAST analysis). We note that the correlated 
7 
evolutionary analysis may be overly conservative in cases where horizontal gene 
8 
transfer is rampant or homoplasies are high. BayesTraits uses a continuous-time 
9 
Markov model to estimate transition rates between the presence and absence of a gene 
10 
or SNP and between human and non-human hosts. We allowed the transition rates to 
11 
evolve in either a correlated fashion (where the rate of change in one trait depends on 
12 
the state found in the other trait) or independently. Posterior distributions of parameters 
13 
were estimated from up to 4 million iterations of the MCMC with default priors. After 
14 
discarding burn-in, the marginal likelihoods of the dependent and independent models 
15 
were obtained using the Akaike Information Criterion (AICM) estimated using the 
16 
methods-of-moment estimator in Tracer 1.659  
17 
  
18 
Genome-wide positive selection analysis. To identify genes under positive selection 
19 
in different host groups, we first identified lineages (STs or CCs) correlated with 
20 
particular hosts. As the power of the selection analysis is determined by the number of 
21 
isolates included, only clades with more than 10 isolates associated with a host were 
22 
considered. Based on these criteria, 15 CCs from four groups of hosts were analyzed: 9 
23 
  
28 
for humans (CC30, CC5, CC59, CC15, CC12, ST239, ST8, CC22 and CC45), 3 for 
1 
ruminants (CC133, primarily associated with sheep and goats and the cows related 
2 
CC151 and CC97), 2 for birds (CC5 and CC385) and one for pigs (CC398) 
3 
(Supplementary Table 7). Although the CC398 clade also contained several human 
4 
isolates, these mostly represent spill-over events rather than an established association 
5 
so the CC398-human group was not included for the analysis. Given the variable 
6 
number of isolates of each CC-host group, in order to standardize the analysis while 
7 
preventing the underestimation of genes under positive selection, 10 isolates linked with 
8 
a host were analyzed at a time. Replicates or triplicates of different subsets of genomes 
9 
using sampling with replacement was carried out if the number of isolates for that 
10 
lineage was large enough. Next, we identified orthologous genes in each of these 
11 
groups using the algorithm OrthoMCL integrated in get_homologues (identity >70%, 
12 
similarity >75%, f50, e-value = 1e-5)53. Genes were considered orthologous if they were 
13 
present in at least 70% of the genomes. Since alignment of coding DNA sequences 
14 
may insert gaps in codons and produce frame-shifts, we aligned genes at the protein 
15 
level using MUSCLE 3.8.3160 and translated these sequences back to DNA using 
16 
pal2nal v1461. Genes identified as inparalogous that turned out to be duplications were 
17 
kept for further analyses, otherwise discarded. For every alignment, recombination was 
18 
detected using the NSS, Max Chi and Phi tests included in PhiPack62 and recombinant 
19 
genes removed from further analyses. For the gene clusters containing 10 isolates, 
20 
phylogenetic trees were extracted from the 783 isolates ML tree. For clusters with less 
21 
than 10 genomes, subtrees were produced from the general tree using the tree prune 
22 
function in ete263. The DNA alignments and trees were used for PAML analysis64. We 
23 
  
29 
employed the site evolution models of Codeml (M1a, M2a, M7, M8 and M8a) to perform 
1 
codon-by-codon analysis of dN/dS ratios (nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution, 
2 
Ï‰) of genes and a likelihood ratio test (LRT) was used to determine significant 
3 
differences between nested models M1a-M2a, M7-M8, M8a-M8, where one accounts 
4 
for positive selection (alternative hypothesis) and the other specifies a neutral model 
5 
(null hypothesis). Statistic tests were assessed to a chi-square distribution with 2 and 1 
6 
degrees of freedom64. Bayes Empirical Bayes65 was used to calculate the posterior 
7 
probabilities of amino acid sites under positive selection of proteins that had significant 
8 
LRTs. As independent replicates from similar CC/Host groups resulted in slightly 
9 
different genes positively selected, we used get_homologues to merge the core 
10 
genomes and genes selected for each group using same parameters as above. Genes 
11 
under positive selection were considered when they were in common for different 
12 
replicates with a p-value of 0.05 or were identified in different replicates with a stringent 
13 
p-value (0.05/number of genes per core genome). 
14 
To explore functional categories under positive selection we performed classification of 
15 
Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs), annotated Gene Ontology terms (GO) and 
16 
analysed metabolic pathways (KEGG). To assign COG terms, we performed BLASTp of 
17 
single representatives of the orthologous clusters against the prot2003-2014 database, 
18 
retrieving the top 5 hits to include alternative annotations. We mapped the gene IDS 
19 
obtained to the cog2003-2014.csv database from which the COGs were inferred. 
20 
Frequencies of COGs for positively selected genes in each CC-host were compared 
21 
with the average COG frequencies in the respective core genomes. GO annotations 
22 
were obtained by mapping the genes to the go_20151121-seqdb, uniprot_sprot and 
23 
  
30 
uniprot_trembl databases using BLASTp. From these, the UniProtKB were mapped to 
1 
the gene_association_goa database and filtered by bacteria domain to obtain the GO 
2 
categories. To visualize and identify overrepresented GO categories of positively 
3 
selected genes in different hosts, we used BiNGO66. We identified overrepresented 
4 
categories using the hypergeometric test with the Benjamini & Hochberg False 
5 
Discovery Rate (FDR) multiple testing correction at a significance level of 5%. We 
6 
chose the â€˜Biological Processâ€™ category and the prokaryotic ontology file 
7 
(gosubset_prok.obo). However, as most groups did not show significant 
8 
overrepresentation, we visualized all the GO categories of genes under positive 
9 
selection and used REVIGO67 with the p-values from BiNGO in order to obtain 
10 
summaries of non-redundant GO terms classified into functional categories.

Analysis of lactose fermentation. S. aureus was cultured in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) in 
13 
presence or absence of 100 mM lactose at 37Â°C for 17 h with shaking at 200 rpm. OD600 
14 
was measured and culture supernatants were collected by centrifugation. Subsequently, 
15 
the pH of the supernatants was measured using a pH meter (Sartorius, UK). Delta pH 
16 
values were calculated by subtracting the pH values of TSB cultures supplemented with 
17 
100 mM lactose from the pH values of normal TSB cultures. Statistical analysis was 
18 
performed in Graphpad Prism 7 using One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukeyâ€™s multiple 
19 
comparison test.

demonstrating the relationship between S. aureus and other members of the S. aureus 
31 
complex; S. schweitzeri and S. argenteus; (b) Phylogenetic (ML) tree of 783 S. aureus 
32 
isolates, with host species indicated in colour or animal symbols indicating major 
33 
  
36 
domesticated animal clones that are largely host-specific. The evolutionary history of S.

events with humans acting as a major hub. (a) Time-scaled phylogeny of a 
6 
subsample of the S. aureus sequences with clonal complexes (CCs) labeled, branches 
7 
colored according to host-species group. Pie charts indicate relative probability of host 
8 
origin at the ancestral nodes, and line thickness corresponds to probability of the 
9 
majority host (see Supplementary Figures 6-10 for all subsamples). Major clonal 
10 
complexes (CC)s are indicated. (b) Quantification of the number of host-switch events: 
11 
Host transition count network from BEAST Markov Jumps models averaged over all 
12 
subsamples of the data. Line-width represents the average Markov Jump count per 
13 
tree, averaged over all subsamples (Supplementary Figures 4-5) and line color 
14 
represents the significance compared to permuted label analysis (Z-score). Only 
15 
transitions with higher counts compared to models with permuted host-labels are shown 
16 
(Z-score >= 0.5).

host-species and evidence for phenotypic adaptation. The main anatomical 
5 
isolation sites on each host group are indicated by filled circles. Functional categories 
6 
virulence and pathogenesis, resistance to antibiotics, transport of ions and cell wall 
7 
biosynthesis were under positive selection in all 4 host-species groups. In humans (a) 
8 
and ruminants (b) the categories amino acids biosynthesis and transport/metabolism of 
9 
carbohydrates were positively selected. The categories amino-acid 
10 
transport/metabolism and biosynthesis of osmoprotectants were under positive 
11 
selection in birds (c) and transposable elements in pigs (d). (e) Phylogenetic tree 
12 
indicating the distinct lineages selected for comparative analysis of lactose 
13 
fermentation,(f) Fermentation of the disaccharide lactose is enhanced in bovine 
14 
lineages. Acidification of S. aureus culture supernatant in presence of 100 mM lactose

as indicated by the delta pH. Experiments were performed in triplicate with 5 strains per 
16 
clonal lineage. Each dot represents the average delta pH per strain and bars indicate 
17 
the SEM per clonal lineage (n = 5). Asterisks indicate significant differences between 
18 
bovine (CC97 and CC151, n = 10), avian (CC5 and CC385, n = 10) and human 
19 
lineages (CC22, CC30, and CC8, n = 15) with **P<0.005, ***P<0.001 and ****P<0.0001

Figure 6. Resistance to antimicrobials is non-randomly associated with host 
23 
species. Proportion (%) of isolates examined which contain the specified resistance 
24 
determinant (Supplementary Table 12). Asterisks indicate significant association of 
25 
resistance determinants with host-species (Fisher exact test), and colored borders 
26 
indicate antibiotic class or single determinants (sdrM and str) that are associated with 
27 
host-species group after testing for phylogenetic independence.
