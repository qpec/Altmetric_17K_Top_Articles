ABSTRACT 
Receiving a mental health diagnosis can be pivotal for service users. It has been described in both positive and 
negative terms. It is unclear what influences service user experience of the diagnostic process; consequently, 
clinicians report uncertainty regarding best practice. This review aimed to understand and inform diagnostic 
practice through a comprehensive synthesis of qualitative data on views and experiences from key stakeholders 
(service users/clinicians/carers/family). We searched five databases and identified 78 papers for inclusion, 
originating from 13 countries and including 2228 participants. Eligible papers were assessed for quality and data 
was coded then developed into themes, which generated a model representing factors to consider for clinicians 
conveying, and individuals receiving, mental health diagnoses. Themes included disclosure, information 
provision, collaboration, timing, stigma, and functional value of diagnosis for recovery. Variations between 
different stakeholders and clinical contexts are explored. Findings support an individualised, collaborative, and 
holistic approach to mental health diagnosis.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
Receiving a formal diagnosis can have significant impact.1 It can help service users understand their 
experiences; provide a sense of relief, control, and containment; offer hope for recovery; improve relationships 
with services; and reduce uncertainty.2–4 Nonetheless, diagnosis may have unintended consequences, increasing 
individual and societal burden. These include feelings of hopelessness, disempowerment, and frustration; stigma 
and discrimination; exacerbated symptoms; as well as disengagement from services.5–7 
Qualitative research designs most appropriately capture peoples’ views and experiences.8 Evidence suggests that 
the impact of diagnosis depends on a variety of factors, including service delivery. For instance, diagnosis was 
experienced negatively when individuals felt they received insufficient information from clinicians.4 
Conversely, when people felt knowledgeable about their diagnosis, it could foster a sense of control, meaning, 
and hope.6 The experience is also affected by the method of communication (e.g. letter), time taken to decide 
and disclose a diagnosis, and whether diagnosis is framed as enduring or malleable.3–5, 9–11 
Previous studies that considered service user experience of mental health diagnosis have focused on a single 
diagnosis, setting, or stage of the process (e.g. disclosure). This limits generalisability. Studies typically explore 
isolated viewpoints of service users, clinicians, or carers/family. Understanding the process of diagnosis from 
the perspective of a single stakeholder has limited utility for guiding service provision, which must be 
implemented at individual, service, and organisational levels. We identified one previous review, but this was 
limited to whether service users received the information they desired.12 To our knowledge, no published 
reviews have yet synthesised data on the entire diagnostic process or included carer/family views.   
This review aimed to incorporate the views of all key stakeholders, throughout the diagnostic process, across 
mental health conditions. This offers opportunity to gain a comprehensive and widely applicable understanding 
of the factors influencing service user experience. Through this, we seek to reveal nuanced consideration of the 
experiential similarities and differences across contexts, such as diagnosis and service setting. This 
understanding will support the diagnostic process to improve service user experience and outcomes. Our review 
is timely, considering the upcoming release of the International Classification of Diseases of Mental and 
Behavioural Disorders (ICD) 11th revision.13 Clinicians have reported uncertainty regarding best practice for the 
diagnostic process, resulting in discomfort and hesitance implementing diagnostic manuals.14–18 We aimed to 
offer practical guidance for clinicians. This review also sought to inform service users and carers/family how to 
navigate the diagnostic process and support participation of all involved.19

METHODS 
Search strategy and selection criteria 
We searched PsychINFO, Embase, MEDLINE, and CINAHL from inception to 20 July 2017 (initial search 
October 2016, updated July 2017).Our search strategy was as follows: (“experienc* ADJ5 diagno*” or 
“perspective* ADJ5 diagno*” or “view* ADJ5 diagno*” or “perce* ADJ5 diagno*” or “communicat* ADJ5 
diagno*” or “receiv* ADJ5 diagno*” or “deliver* ADJ5 diagno*” or “giv* ADJ5 diagno*” or “process* ADJ5 
diagno*” or “news ADJ5 diagno*” or “inform* ADJ5 diagno*” or “disclos* ADJ5 diagno*” or “tell* ADJ5 
diagno*” or “breaking ADJ5 news” or “deliver* ADJ5 news”) and (“mental health” or “mental illness*” or 
“psychiatric disorder” or MESH terms relating to psychiatric disorders, adapted for each database [see appendix 
1]). 
 
Inclusion criteria encompassed primary research with a formal qualitative component, gathering data on service 
user, clinician, and/or carer/family views and experiences regarding the process of adult mental health diagnosis. 
We placed no restrictions on language of publication. Papers not reported in English were translated. We 
included dissertations, doctoral theses, and non-peer reviewed reports to reduce potential for publication bias. 
We also searched the first 20 pages of Google Scholar, contacted key authors, and reviewed reference lists of 
included papers. We excluded developmental disorders, somatoform disorders, substance abuse and dual-
diagnosis, dementia, traumatic brain injury, and diagnosis during childhood (under 18 years). We selected these 
exclusion criteria as they involve services outside the scope of our review and these diagnoses require additional 
or different processes (e.g. further physiological testing, compulsory parent/guardian involvement). 
 
Two authors (AP, JR) independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. To establish inter-rater 
reliability, the first 50 studies were screened together. Full-text articles of potentially eligible studies were 
screened by AP and JR. Where full-text articles were unavailable, we contacted authors. Uncertainties were 
resolved by discussion, with involvement of a third reviewer where necessary (GP, CN). 
 
 
Two reviewers (AP, JR) extracted data. A pre-piloted table was used to extract demographic and methodological 
information (table 1). We assessed study quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) 
qualitative assessment checklist,20 supplemented with narrative appraisal in which we considered alternative 
reporting checklists (e.g. COREQ).21 Three reviewers (AP, JR, DB) assigned quantified quality scores (table 1). 
NVivo v.11 software22 was used to code first-order (participant quotations) and second-order (researcher 
interpretations – i.e. concepts, themes, and descriptions of findings derived from data) data line by line (AP, 
JR).23,24 To establish reliability, the first ten percent of papers were extracted and coded by two reviewers 
together (AP, JR). These reviewers independently verified a further ten percent subsample of the data extraction 
and coding.  
Thematic synthesis involved the development of descriptive and analytical themes, going beyond initial coding 
by accounting for transferability (to different contexts), relevancy to the research objectives, and frequency of 
data. Themes were combined into a model representing groups of factors influencing service user experience of 
diagnosis. To examine variance across context, we compared themes of papers focused on different 
stakeholders, diagnoses, service settings, countries, time periods, and cultures. We conducted a sensitivity 
analysis to assess the impact of quality appraisal, examining whether including exclusively high-quality studies 
altered findings. A service user, clinician, and academics contributed to the analysis.25,26 Consensus seeking 
ensured triangulation of different perspectives and minimisation of bias.  
The protocol was registered with PROSPERO, number: CRD42016047013. 
Role of the funding source 
There was no funding source for this study. All authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 
RESULTS 
Our searches yielded 18,104 results, of which we screened 533 full-text articles for eligibility (figure 1). We 
included 67 studies (reported in 78 papers) in thematic synthesis (table 1). Total sample size was 2228 (mean = 
33; range = 4 – 274). Studies were conducted in two middle-income and eleven high-income countries: UK 
(21), USA (17), Australia (13), Canada (5), Netherlands (2), Brazil (2), Sweden (1), New Zealand (1), Latvia 
 4 
 
 
 
(1), Belarus (1), and Israel (1). Two studies collected data across multiple countries (Denmark and Norway; 
USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and UK). Thirty-seven studies involved service users, fifteen involved 
clinicians, seven involved carers/family, and eight were mixed samples. Diagnoses included psychotic disorders 
(16), depression (13), personality disorders (12), bipolar disorder (5), anxiety (1), eating disorders (1), mixed 
(12), and unspecified mental illness (7). Studies spanned from 1994-2017.  
Participants were recruited from a range of settings, including primary care, community, specialist, and inpatient 
services. Research methods included interviews (47), focus groups (7), questionnaires (3), mixed (9), and online 
observations (1). 
Inductive thematic synthesis, derived from data of included studies, is represented in a model of factors 
identified as influential on service user experience of diagnosis (figure 2). Themes developed from codes are 
depicted with their relative ‘weight’, demonstrated by the coding frequency of each theme (shown in the key 
and numeric labels of figure 2). Our model comprises three superordinate categories: service provision, external, 
and internal factors. Service provision factors were most frequently cited and are further divided into three 
subgroups representing different stages of the diagnostic process: deciding, communicating, and using the 
diagnosis. We found that the journey through these stages is typically sequential, though there is potential for 
repetition and/or circularity of stages. The external and internal factors predate, occur alongside, and postdate 
service-level influences. They impact service user experience both directly and in interaction with service 
provision factors and each other.  
To illustrate themes, we have displayed quotations from included studies in table 2.   
 
Service provision factors  
Deciding the diagnosis  
Drivers of diagnosis. Whether decisions were driven by service user need was a major theme contributing to a 
diagnosis being experienced as accurate and validating. Some service users felt diagnoses were instead driven 
by political motives like power and control; business, financial, and resource affairs (e.g. treatment costs); or 
clinician fears of causing harm (e.g. damaging therapeutic relationships). Clinicians reported feeling pressured 
by these issues during diagnostic decision-making.  
Comprehensiveness and quality of the diagnostic assessment. Service users found it disconcerting when they 
perceived a lack of thoughtful and rigorous appraisal preceding diagnosis. Both service users and clinicians felt 
the process was more validating and effective when a breadth of factors were considered (i.e. biopsychosocial), 
alongside severity, burden, and chronicity of symptoms. They felt that diagnostic manuals (e.g. ICD) could 
guide assessment, but were sometimes unhelpful because of inaccurate or incomplete symptom descriptors. 
Service users also expressed that to fully capture their experience, it was beneficial to consider comorbidities 
and the potential diagnosis of multiple conditions.  
Time to diagnose. Clinicians expressed that diagnosis is complex; a comprehensive assessment takes time. They 
reported challenges across several areas, including differentiating disorders with overlapping symptoms, 
deciding what was and was not ‘normal’, and complications from symptom fluctuation. Nevertheless, service 
users often felt diagnosis was delayed; causing uncertainty, sense of rejection or abandonment, and delay in 
treatment. Service users more often reported a positive experience when diagnosis was felt to be efficient and 
timely.  
Diagnostic accuracy and ‘fit’. Service users reported that diagnosis was most helpful when it ‘fit’ their 
experience of symptoms; providing relief, validation, and a framework to interpret experiences. In contrast, 
misdiagnosis (being given one diagnosis then later being told another is more appropriate without a perceived 
change in presentation) caused distress, loss of confidence in services, and inappropriate treatment. Service 
users and clinicians felt it was unhelpful to over-pathologise and diagnose mild experiences that did not cause 
distress or dysfunction, or to under-diagnose or overlook a problem. This could cause service users to reject 
their diagnosis or feel dismissed. When diagnosis was felt to be inaccurate, sometimes attributed to change in 
symptomatology over time, it was reported helpful to remove or change the diagnosis accordingly; permanency 
of diagnostic labels was viewed negatively.  
Communicating the diagnosis 
 5 
 
 
 
Disclosure. This theme encompassed the most codes. Disclosure was frequently described as a pivotal moment 
for service users (figure 2). Clinicians described an internal struggle or dilemma, whereby they were unsure 
whether disclosure was beneficial. Most clinicians felt service users had a right to know their diagnosis, whilst 
simultaneously fearing potential harm. Although sometimes experienced negatively, service users generally 
reported preference for disclosure; giving relief, validating their experiences, as well as providing greater self-
understanding and empowerment. There were numerous negative accounts of having a diagnosis withheld that 
caused service users to feel isolated, confused, or insignificant. Service users felt particularly uninformed about 
changes to their diagnosis. Paradoxically, many clinicians reported reluctance to disclose due to fear of 
subjecting service users to stigma or damaging the therapeutic relationship, yet non-disclosure was more often 
associated with these outcomes.  
Both service users and clinicians reported instances of disclosure using vague, ‘less stigmatising’, or 
euphemistic labels, compared to specific or ‘true’ diagnoses (e.g. emotional dysregulation vs. borderline 
personality disorder). Clinicians described using this practice to protect service user’s best interests, yet service 
users reported uncertainty, reduced agency, and damaged therapeutic relationships as a result. Service users 
found it unhelpful when disclosure was unplanned, insensitive, or delayed. For example, discovering a diagnosis 
on health records, letters, or when it was ‘let slip’ in care meetings caused distress. Whilst some clinicians were 
cautious of causing potential harm through premature disclosure, this juxtaposed service user reports that delays 
to disclosure were common and can have adverse consequences. Finally, service users found the process less 
damaging for identity when diagnosis was disclosed as a name for their experiences, rather than framed as an 
inherent trait, which could feel blaming or like a personal attack.  
Provision of information. This had a pronounced influence on the experience of diagnosis and yielded the 
second greatest number of codes (figure 2). Many clinicians expressed concerns regarding lack of time and 
resources; also reflected by service users who often reported being given little or no information when 
diagnosed. Nonetheless, receiving information about a diagnosis was empowering and normalising for service 
users. Understanding symptoms provided validation and often helped people come to terms with their diagnosis, 
despite sometimes causing fear initially. Service users and clinicians reported that diagnostic manuals could be a 
useful tool to learn about the diagnosis and its associated symptoms, though this approach was sometimes 
experienced as impersonal, and language could be interpreted as derogatory or confusing. Service users also 
found it helpful to receive information about likely causes of symptoms and the reasoning behind diagnostic 
decision-making. Yet many felt aetiology went unexplored, and diagnoses were ‘plucked from the air’; causing 
confusion, shock, and sometimes rejection of the diagnosis. Further, service users expressed that diagnosis 
created fear and uncertainty about the future, with insufficient information and discussion regarding prognosis.  
When and how information was accessed impacted service user experience. Delay could be experienced as 
neglectful, while having excessive information too soon was overwhelming. Resources like leaflets, books, and 
web pages were helpful, sometimes preferred. Nonetheless, sole reliance on self-research without face-to-face 
discussion with a clinician was damaging, leading people to feel dismissed or unclear about their diagnosis. 
Service users reported feeling hopeless when told their condition was permanent or untreatable. Rather, being 
offered realistic messages of hope yielded a more constructive experience. Service users discussed the use of 
biomedical approaches to explain the diagnosis or its cause. Some found this helpful as it reduced self-blame, 
though others criticised the approach for being inconsistent with their pre-existing psychosocial explanations. In 
addition, service users often felt there was too much jargon, preferring accessible information, as long as it was 
not experienced as too simplistic, uninformative, or patronising.  
Using the diagnosis  
Functional value of diagnosis. Service users experienced diagnosis more positively when offered as a tool for 
recovery leading to appropriate treatment. It was considered most helpful when used to guide care in 
consideration with service user preference and other factors (e.g. previous treatment experiences); relying solely 
on diagnosis was considered negligent. Similarly, service users believed that diagnosis should not be a pre-
requisite to accessing services. Others felt their diagnosis was meaningless for recovery, or even removed 
support and evoked prejudice from providers. Diagnosis without functional value was experienced as 
disempowering and frustrating, leading to hopelessness and distrust of services. Service users expected 
treatment to follow diagnosis and were taken aback when this was not provided. Clinicians reported reluctance 
to record diagnoses due to potential harm (e.g. stigma), despite potentially impacting continuity of care. 
Ongoing support. Both service users and clinicians emphasised concern about consequences of diagnosis, 
including impacts on relationships, finances, and identity. Service users reported follow-up appointments as 
helpful; to revisit the diagnosis and address its consequences, particularly stigma. Collaborative discussion was 
 6 
 
 
 
favoured, as service users reported occasions when clinicians made erroneous predictions about the 
consequences of diagnosis.   
Factors across superordinate themes  
Collaborative and therapeutic relationships. Across all stages of the diagnostic process, service users felt 
respected when clinicians were empathetic, caring, and attuned to individual needs. Collaboration was preferred, 
though such practice was infrequently reported. Many service users described their diagnosing clinician as an 
‘authoritative expert’, causing them to feel uninvolved, unheard, and potentially reject the diagnosis. Service 
users particularly found diagnostic decision-making more positive and credible when their expertise and 
opinions were valued alongside clinical knowledge. Nonetheless, sometimes this caused service users to feel 
overwhelmed and clinicians to feel strained with regards to time and resources. Consistent therapeutic 
relationships were favoured by service users and clinicians alike, as they eased personal discussion and rapport. 
Quality of relationships between clinicians within and across services was also important. Service users valued a 
multi-disciplinary approach that supported a holistic diagnosis, though some clinicians reported futile team 
dynamics as a limiting factor.  
Involvement of carers, family, and peers. Where appropriate, carer/family involvement helped service users 
navigate services and come to terms with their diagnosis. Additionally, peer support groups reduced isolation, 
normalised the diagnosis, and facilitated acceptance and coping. Whilst carers/family sometimes found 
diagnosis a relief, it could also be distressing and confusing. Carers/family often reported a lack of involvement 
and support from clinicians, including poor provision of information and limited opportunity for discussion, 
which could have negative, indirect influences on service user experience.  
External factors  
Stigma, discrimination, and culture. This theme accumulated the largest number of codes amongst non-service-
related factors. Service users found the diagnostic process damaging when it resulted in stigma. Many reported 
negative social ‘side-effects’ of diagnosis, including hostility, exclusion, and marginalisation by others. Some 
felt they were no longer seen as a person, but as a diagnosis, to be feared or avoided. Fear of stigma alone could 
create anxiety about being diagnosed and cause isolation. When a service user’s culture considered a diagnosis 
as ‘normal’ or socially acceptable, the process was considered less frightening and easier to accept than when a 
diagnosis was associated with cultural discourses of abnormality, defectiveness, or ‘craziness’.  
Support from others. Some service users reported that it was easier to adjust to a diagnosis with support and 
encouragement from carers, family, and friends, as it reduced fear and isolation. At times, diagnosis led to the 
development of new social networks and a sense of peer connectedness, which normalised the experience. This 
differs to the involvement of carers, family, and peers theme as it applies to the broader context outside service 
provision that is associated with adjusting to a diagnosis.  
Internal factors 
Service users’ prior experiences and help-seeking. Many had preconceptions of diagnoses, developed from prior 
experiences. If these were negative (e.g. associated with poor outcome through negative familial experiences of 
mental health conditions), the diagnostic process could be particularly anxiety-provoking. Many also developed 
theories about the cause of their symptoms. If these did not correspond with explanations offered by services 
(e.g. believing symptoms were physical rather than psychological), the experience was conflicted. More 
broadly, if service users felt nothing was wrong or did not want a diagnosis, the process could cause anger and 
frustration. Those who were seeking help or diagnosis were more likely to experience relief and validation.  
Service user identity and recovery. Diagnosis was distressing when it was perceived as undermining individual 
identity; causing feelings of shame or loss when individuals felt like ‘just a diagnosis’, a ‘freak’, or ‘worthless’. 
On the other hand, service users less frequently found diagnosis protected or positively defined their identity. 
Furthermore, when useful for recovery, service users experienced the process as meaningful and empowering; 
bringing attention to their difficulties and giving them ‘something to grasp’, providing direction for positive 
change. There was significant individual variation within this theme as the service user processed the diagnosis 
over time; a journey influenced by service provision and external factors.  
Subgroup analysis  
We reflected similarities and differences between stakeholders in the overall analysis. An overarching finding 
was that, despite uncertainty, clinicians aimed to provide best care, yet this was sometimes found unhelpful or 
 7 
 
 
 
harmful by service users. There were limited carer/family papers for comparison, though a common theme 
among this group was feeling excluded from the process. 
Analyses revealed substantial similarity between diagnoses, albeit with some variation. Issues of non-disclosure 
and poor provision of information were commonly reported for psychotic and personality disorder diagnoses. 
These diagnoses were most associated with negative impacts for identity and hope for recovery. Personality 
disorder diagnoses were also found to have least functional value, and most likely to cause removal of services; 
reportedly being perceived as ‘not a mental illness’ or ‘difficult’, with connotations of blame. Correspondingly, 
personality disorders were most associated with institutionalised stigma within mental health services, whereas 
the other diagnoses were mainly associated with social stigmatisation. Depression diagnoses were most 
commonly experienced as validating, difficult to diagnose due to manifestations of physical symptoms, and 
most often understood within a medical model. Inadequate involvement of family and carers was most 
frequently reported for psychotic diagnoses.  
We found themes were highly consistent between service types, though some differences were noted between 
primary and secondary care. Limited confidence and hesitancy about diagnostic decision-making were 
commonly reported by clinicians in primary care settings. They discussed difficulty with diagnosing physical 
manifestations of mental health conditions, short consultations, and limited resources. The medical model was 
frequently associated with primary care settings, and team/family/carer involvement was mostly mentioned in 
secondary and specialist settings. We found issues with assessment, disclosure, information provision, value of 
diagnosis for treatment and recovery, stigma, and identity were similar across time. Service user self-research 
(e.g. on the internet), access to peer support, and developing a sense of connectedness with others who have 
mental health diagnoses were mostly reported in studies conducted within the past 10 years. Use of a medical 
model was discussed less over time, and the impact of cultural differences in presentation on diagnostic 
decision-making was increasingly reported. In cross-national comparisons, we found issues with diagnoses 
being driven by billing and insurance unique to studies in Australia and the USA. Themes regarding political 
and financial influences on diagnostic decision-making were most prevalent in USA research. Stigma was 
frequently discussed in studies focused on cultural minorities.  
When including only the top quality rated studies (highest 20% of scores) in analysis, themes identified in the 
model were unchanged. 
DISCUSSION 
Understanding the factors influencing service user experience of diagnosis was limited by research focused on 
specific diagnoses, settings, or stages of the diagnostic process. Our synthesis identifies that how diagnoses are 
decided, communicated, and used by services is important. Disclosure, information provision, collaboration, 
timing, and functional value for recovery were among the most prominent themes. External and internal factors 
were found to further influence service user experience throughout the diagnostic process.  
Findings are represented in a model to inform service provision and clinical decision-making (figure 2). To 
increase practical utility, we present themes as considerations for clinicians as they work with individuals 
through their diagnostic journey. These could be drawn upon in the implementation of diagnostic manuals, 
including the forthcoming release of ICD-11.13 Whilst these manuals provide clinical descriptors that can guide 
diagnostic decisions, they do not inform clinicians how to communicate or use the diagnosis. Our model aims to 
compliment diagnostic manuals, providing guidance for communication and potentially alleviating uncertainty 
previously reported by clinicians. Our review also sought to inform service users and carers/family; access to 
our model could support them to navigate the diagnostic experience and be actively involved.   
We suggest that the model forms the basis of initial and ongoing diagnostic discussions between clinicians and 
service users. It encourages a holistic approach, including consideration of internal and external factors directly 
and in interaction with service factors. Of note, all stakeholders reported that diagnosis could be experienced as 
‘labelling’, which had consequences for stigma and discrimination. This aligns with Link and Phelan’s theory 
(2001) that stigma exists when people distinguish and give labels to human differences which are associated 
with negative stereotypes.27 Our subgroup analyses found that stigma was consistently reported over time, 
suggesting it is an ongoing issue. Discussing and providing support about stigma during the diagnostic 
encounter might be a development which service users reported to find helpful.  
Our review advances previous research by collating and comparing experiences of service users, clinicians, and 
carers/family. Triangulation of perspectives in this area is novel and allows a more complex understanding of 
diagnostic practice. Findings suggest an element of unfounded paternalism. Many clinicians felt hesitant to 
 8 
 
 
 
decide and disclose a diagnosis, due to uncertainty or concern about causing harm, yet service users reported 
negative consequences from having a diagnosis withheld. Results also reveal discordant understandings and 
expectations of diagnosis between stakeholders. For instance, clinicians emphasised difficulty and the need for 
time to make an accurate diagnosis, yet service users often felt diagnosis took too long. Highlighting variations 
in perspectives should encourage open and reciprocal discussions between service users and clinicians about 
preferences, expectations, and concerns regarding the diagnostic process. Such discussions might provide the 
foundation to make informed, transparent, and collaborative decisions regarding diagnostic practice, facilitating 
better outcomes for service users.  
Comparison of diagnoses, service settings, time periods, countries, and cultures allowed us to identify 
considerations that may be more important in some contexts or groups than others. For example, stigma was 
frequently mentioned by research with cultural minorities, and negative impacts for identity and hope for 
personality disorder diagnoses. It is therefore important to be mindful of these differences and their potential 
associated influences. Our review draws attention to other areas for reflection about clinical practice. Most 
prominent in the data were non-disclosure of psychotic and personality disorder diagnoses, as well as less 
recovery-orientated practice in diagnosing personality disorders. Also evident were financial influences on 
diagnosis in the USA and Australia. Further, where access to information and service user communities have 
increased, self-research and peer support may be more important to explore during diagnostic conversations. 
Increasing diversity within society means that cultural differences in social constructions of mental illness and 
presentation should also be considered. Clinicians identified particular difficulty with diagnosing in primary 
care settings, and using a team approach in multi-disciplinary settings, highlighting potential areas for clinical 
training.   
Our synthesis offers a way to integrate diagnosis with recovery approaches increasingly represented in 
international policy; emphasising hope, identity, and empowerment.19 Recovery-focused models are 
traditionally thought to contrast with diagnosis, but many clinicians who value diagnoses are supportive of 
recovery approaches.28 Our model could inform the diagnostic process to be conducted in a way that is 
concordant with recovery principles. It particularly supports collaboration, person-centred care, and service user 
agency and empowerment, reflecting recommendations about service user participation.19  
Diagnosis has been criticised for being overly medicalised, offering limited information about causation of 
psychiatric disorders, and poor instruction for intervention.29 A case formulation approach has been considered a 
viable alternative to diagnosis.29,30 Whilst the two practices are often considered dissimilar, our review suggests 
the experience of diagnosis may be improved by integrating some of the principles of psychological 
formulation.29,30 This includes collaboratively developing a holistic understanding of a person’s difficulties that 
addresses aetiology, then using diagnosis as a tool to guide treatment and recovery. Further research could 
assess the benefit of the two processes becoming more affiliated within clinical services.  
This systematic review offers a widely applicable understanding of the factors influencing service user 
experience of diagnosis, capturing variation across contexts. Our model is evidence based; developed through a 
coproduced process of rigorous synthesis. Whilst we presented overarching findings, it is important to recognise 
individual experiences of the diagnostic process; factors and practices may affect different people in different 
ways. For example, we identified the provision of information was especially beneficial for individuals with 
negative preconceptions or limited understanding of their diagnosis. Similarly, clear disclosure was empowering 
to some but destructive for others. We therefore emphasise that there is not one ‘right’ way to diagnose; rather 
the data promotes an approach that is sensitive to an individual’s needs and preferences. A strength of our model 
is that it accounts for individuality by posing themes as questions for consideration, rather than providing a ‘best 
practice’ checklist. We propose that clinicians and service users have open discussions about the factors 
identified (e.g. timing) to decide best practice for an individual. This aligns with growing evidence and guidance 
supporting shared decision making.31 We also emphasise that diagnosis is not always wanted, necessary, or 
beneficial, irrespective of how the process is conducted; some service users, clinicians, and carers/family 
opposed the practice of diagnosis entirely. We recommend establishing service user views on diagnosing early 
in consultation and proceeding according to individual preference, considering potential alternatives such as 
clinical formulation.  
A limitation of this review was a lack of published research for some diagnoses, meaning they were 
insufficiently represented in our synthesis. There was only one study each for anxiety and eating disorders. It is 
possible that the influencing factors for these diagnoses differ, potentially making the model less appropriate for 
some groups. Rather, it may be most representative of the factors influencing psychotic, depressive, and 
personality disorders, which were the most common diagnoses explored in the literature. Similarly, most 
included studies were from the UK, USA, and Australia. Whilst themes appeared similar, there were limited 
 9 
 
 
 
data from other countries, potentially not capturing cultural variations and limiting transferability of our model. 
Further, all countries included are upper-middle to high income and it is likely that service user experience will 
differ in lower income countries where access to care and resources are limited. Whilst we incorporated research 
on multiple stakeholders, there were limited studies including carers/family. These voices may therefore be 
underrepresented. Future research would benefit from comparing findings with other contexts, such as child 
mental health services, and populations such as dual diagnosis. We recommend future testing of the 
acceptability, validity, and utility of this model with service users, clinicians, and carers/family.  
Receiving a mental health diagnosis can hugely impact service users’ lives, yet there has been limited research 
into how to best approach the diagnostic process. Our coproduced, evidence-based model may directly inform 
clinical training and practice; functioning as a reflective guide for clinicians. The model promotes a holistic 
understanding of individuals, which can empower, provide hope, and guide treatment. We emphasise that the 
model should be drawn on in collaboration with service users, and sensitivity to individual needs and 
preferences is important. The aim of our model as a foundation for open, transparent, and collaborative 
decisions regarding diagnostic practice is to facilitate improved experiences and outcomes for service users.

Deciding the diagnosis 
 
 
Drivers of diagnosis  
It seems as if consumers in the U.S. get stuck with and in their diagnosis due to 
insurance needs. (p.499)55 
 
… maybe I hesitate to diagnose a depression because of the long term treatment with 
antidepressant drugs... (p.56)17  
 
Makers of the DSM are in the pockets of ‘Big Pharma’. (p.499)55 
 
I have a lot of difficulty throwing that diagnosis on somebody, because to be really 
honest with you, when somebody gets diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, 
it’s a really negative diagnosis. (pp.69-70)89 
 … there is a tendency for [diagnosis] to be seen more as a label, and one associated 
with stigma in the community, which almost certainly contributes to reluctance to make 
a specific diagnosis. (p.376)15 
 
… Darlene wondered if her initial bipolar diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder, later 
modified to Bipolar I, was given only to minimize her distress. (p.139)60 
 
Comprehensiveness and quality 
of the diagnostic assessment   
So I said, “How can they diagnose me as bipolar if they don‘t even know who the hell I 
am, because I don‘t even know who the hell I am”? (p.189)60 
 
Psychiatrists take history of things in Axis 3… but it seems as if there is little interest in 
exploring how Axis 3 conditions influence the diagnosis of mental illness. (p.499)55  
 
 
… GPs emphasize the necessity for a holistic approach to understanding the patient, 
including work, relationships and family contexts, in the process of making a diagnosis. 
(p.376)15 
 
Rebecca partly links her positive experience with getting the diagnosis with the process 
in which she got it. The doctor took time to examine her in great detail, not just 
subjecting her to standard tests or questionnaires. (p.27)81 
 
Assessments that seemed hurried, overly formal or impersonal, and clinicians who it 
was felt did not acknowledge their client’s suffering, left participants feeling frustrated 
and unheard. (p.237)37  
Time to diagnose  
For so many years I haven’t, sort of like, had a label, I’ve sort of like floated. (p.260)6  
 
Sometimes I’m a bit hesitant to… say ‘Yes, you’ve got schizophrenia,’ because I’ll be 
thinking, ‘What if it’s drugs? What if it isn’t a schizophreniform [disorder], have we 
really had enough time?’ and things like that. (p.552)16 
 
It took us about 4 years to finally get a diagnosis for our daughter. It was not until we 
found a great psychiatrist in the private system, that we were given a clear diagnosis and 
the information and understanding of what our daughter was suffering from. (p.25)75  
 
…delayed or inaccurate diagnoses frequently resulted in no intervention, less 
appropriate treatments being implemented, and/or repeated hospital admissions. 
(p.S49)62 
 
One of the concerns of clinicians was a lack of diagnostic certainty, including the 
length of time needed to make a confident diagnosis, variables that confound a clear 
diagnosis, the symptom overlap between different diagnoses, and the fact that there are 
no confirmatory laboratory tests to buttress clinical opinion. (p.552)16  
 
GPs suggested that they used time as a tool… to increase certainty over the diagnosis... 
(p.6)53 
Diagnostic accuracy and ‘fit’  
What a waste of life with being diagnosed the wrong things. (p.30)74  
 
… I don't like that there's a sheet that says what you must have if you have bipolar and 
I'm like ‘well that's not true because I don't have that, and I don't have that’. (p.12)39 
 
It explained a lot of things and I felt an enormous sense of relief… (p.233)72  
…participants expressed relief at receiving a “the right” diagnostic label as it offered an 
explanation for their distressing emotions and behaviours… (p.13)73 
 
The burden of illness was exacerbated by difficulties with obtaining an accurate 
diagnosis. (p.S47)62 
 19 
 
 
 
Communicating the diagnosis 
 
 
Disclosure  
I didn’t understand why I was so sensitive… It was really a relief to find out that it 
wasn’t something else or that it was just me…  it was rather good to discover that I had 
an illness, even if it’s not a very nice thing… it explained why I felt the way I did. 
(p.1227)64 
 
I knew what was wrong with me, and if I knew what was wrong with me I had a chance 
of possibly understanding it better and maybe work on it a bit more… (p.461)76 
 
Because some people just think borderline personality means difficult patient you know 
and I, that’s not my opinion, but the thing is because of all that bad press of borderline 
um I don’t bring that up right away. (p.87)86 
Open diagnostic information sharing was often recommended by participants as it 
provided an understanding of the issues and symptoms, and facilitated access to 
treatment and support… (p.461)76 
 
It was a matter of concern that several people reported they had only discovered their 
diagnosis by accident, for example, on the back of a Disability Living Allowance form, 
on a hospital discharge certificate and, in one case unfortunately, on receiving a letter 
from their consultant asking if they would like to take part in this research… Apart from 
the shock of finding out such sensitive information in this way, the lack of any 
accompanying explanation left these individuals feeling anxious and upset. (pp.363-4)7 
Provision of information  
It was quite nice to like for him to say I don’t think it’s bipolar, because – this reason, 
this reason, this one. But, I do think you are a little bit borderline because of this, this 
and this… He was like explaining it in a like a quite a simple way sort of thing instead 
of like ‘‘you’re this and that’s it’’. (p.237)37 
 
Not surprisingly then, as participants began to recognize the fleeting and arbitrary 
nature of the labels that the mental health system gave them, and how they lacked any 
meaning within the context of their own lives, they soon began to reject the labels 
altogether. (p.53)5  
 
I can’t emphasise this enough… I would have accepted it more if they explained what 
schizophrenia was… (p.731)3 
Individuals indicated that diagnostic conversations that were devoid of hope were 
extremely immobilizing and potentially dangerous…hope-focused discussions centered 
on recognition that individuals could live meaningful lives and be productive members 
of society. (p.462)76 
 
Where diagnosis was disclosed, sometimes the lack of information that accompanied 
that disclosure was one of the main causes of disempowerment. Lack of information 
meant participants often experienced diagnosis as ‘a prognosis of doom’ about their 
future. (p.421)4 
 
Using the diagnosis 
 
 
Functional value of diagnosis  
 
I think it was more of a case, it was, you have to be categorised, you have to be put in a 
box in some ways… we can’t do much for you but we need to label you. (p.262)6 
 
I guess it seems like the diagnosis hasn’t been used; it’s been abused and has become 
more of just a wastebasket versus something to help direct treatment. (p.288)79 
In many situations, diagnoses serve to guide a plan of care and, thus, are viewed as 
useful. For these participants, however, the diagnosis… perpetuated a sense of being 
marginalized and potentially mistreated. (p.288)79 
 
Personality disorder was seen as having all the drawbacks of a mental illness diagnosis, 
especially in terms of stigma, but none of the benefits, particularly access to services. 
(p.365)7 
Ongoing support  
I was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder. I had no idea that’s what I had. I felt quite 
distressed afterwards and would have liked someone to talk to... (p.30)52 
 
 
A number of patients expressed the need for post-assessment support, particularly when 
given a new and unexpected diagnosis… (p.30)52 
 
…it was seen as useful to offer more in-depth discussion and information at follow-up. 
(p.739)10 
Factors across superordinate 
themes 
 
 
Collaborative and therapeutic 
relationships  
It’s horrible having a label, having a label done to you. (p.233)72  
 
… overall, I think it is better to know and they talk to you about it [diagnosis], although 
it might take time to adjust to the thought of things, it’s the “old nothing about me 
without me” idea. (p.463)76  
 
 
Clinicians spoke of the importance of being as approachable as possible, attending to 
the patient’s needs during the interview being a priority, and rapport being the basis of 
therapeutic interaction… (p.176)80 
 
Most participants said they preferred a multidisciplinary approach... (p.176)80 
 
Danielle described how any questions about the diagnosis were met with ‘‘No, this is 
 20 
 
 
 
definitely what you have. We are 100% sure”. (pp.260-1)6 
Involvement of family, carers, 
and peers 
They [Clinicians] were telling me stuff, but I’m so sick I can’t take it on board. Your 
family, your carer, have to work together. They don’t do that enough, they just treat the 
patient. (p.463)76 
 
… the majority of family members reported that learning more about the illness and 
understanding its effects helped them to accept the diagnosis. (p.138)48 
 
A proportion of participants described family involvement as crucial as they supported 
the persons to navigate the system. (p.463)76  
 
External factors  
 
 
Stigma, discrimination, and 
culture 
Schizophrenic is the worst diagnosis because I’ve heard it in the newspapers and on TV, 
that they are really mad schizophrenic people, they are very dangerous to society, 
they’ve got no control. So obviously I came under that category. (p.177)49 
 
I’d heard about people that had been diagnosed with personality disorder being the 
black sheep of the community. It made me feel I didn't belong anywhere. (p.55)42 
Fears related to the stigma attached to mental illness and the diagnosis meant that 
individuals tried to hide their diagnosis or did not want to accept the fact that they have 
been identified as mentally ill. (p.444)67 
 
…clinicians commented that misconceptions and stigma relating to the diagnostic label 
still influenced a person’s response to the diagnosis. (p.740)10 
 
…the effects of stigma resulting from a diagnosis can play a role in relapse and hinder 
the recovery process. (p.422)4 
Support from others  
He [father] wouldn’t say the actual words… when I was diagnosed with being bipolar 
over the summer, my dad, there is no way that those words will ever come out of his 
mouth. And if I say something to him about it, he still doesn’t believe it… Because of 
the way that I’ve seen them react to the diagnosis of bipolar, that totally gives me an 
idea of how people are going to react if I tell them about it. If it’s my family that is 
reacting this way, how are people who I’m not even close to going to react? (p.147)50 
… participants felt that they may have accepted the diagnosis sooner… if they had 
greater support from family and friends. (p.138)48 
 
Several participants reported receiving positive messages, motivation, and support from 
their families which helped them come to terms with their diagnoses. (p.144)50 
 
Internal factors  
 
 
Service user’s prior experiences 
and help-seeking 
It is good to put a name on somethings, because I knew there was something wrong 
there must be a reason as to why I am like I am. (p.233)72 
 
I believe the time is ripe for it; it has been long enough now that I’ve been letting this 
prey on my mind. I just needed this prod. Now it’s time to clear my mind. (p.441)96 
Their predominant reaction was to associate bipolar disorder with “crazy” and out-of-
control or unpredictable behaviour…They remembered all of the worst conditions of 
their relatives with psychiatric and other cognitive disabilities and assumed their lives 
would follow the same trajectory. (p.250)60 
Service user identity and 
recovery  
Having a name to put to that gave me something to attack. It gave me something to 
work with ... a tangible framework of something I could manage. (p.15)73 
 
You’re not human, once you have got that disorder you’re not a human anymore, that 
goes your name goes. (p.233)72 
 
… it's made me very insecure about my worth as a person, who I am, because I used to 
be so capable and now I'm a nothing, a nobody. It's taken everything away from me. 
(p.11)39 
 
It was the beginning of being able to sort out a lifetime of feelings, events… my entire 
life. It was the chance for a new beginning. (p.66)65 
Our results show that the common nominator among our informants is process – people 
are always in process as their relationship to a categorization like a depression diagnosis 
is never static, but always in motion. (p.30)81 
 
While participants expressed relief at receiving a ‘the right’ diagnostic label… there 
was fear associated with “being” the label and what this meant for their relationships 
and sense of self. (p.13)73 
 
The diagnosis impacted the sense of self and identity of all of the participants. They all 
said words to the effect of ‘it IS me,’ rather than, ‘this is something I have and will have 
to deal with’. (p.176)60
