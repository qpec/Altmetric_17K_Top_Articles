 Medicaid Tobacco Cessation: Big Gaps Remain In Efforts To Get 
Smokers To Quit
Leighton Ku, Brian K. Bruen, Erika Steinmetz, and Tyler Bysshe
Abstract
Medicaid enrollees are about twice as likely as the general US population to smoke tobacco: 32 
percent of people in the program identify themselves as smokers. This article provides the first 
data about the effectiveness of state Medicaid programs in promoting smoking cessation. Our 
analysis of Medicaid enrollees’ use of cessation medications found that about 10 percent of 
current smokers received cessation medications in 2013. Every state Medicaid program covers 
cessation benefits, but the use of these medications varies widely, with the rate in Minnesota being 
thirty times higher than that in Texas. Most states could increase their efforts to help smokers quit, 
working with public health agencies, managed care plans, and others. In 2013 Medicaid spent 
$103 million on cessation medications—less than 0.25 percent of the estimated cost to Medicaid 
of smoking-related diseases. Additionally, states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility in the 
wake of the Affordable Care Act have higher smoking prevalence and lower utilization rates of 
cessation medication, compared to expansion states. Given these factors, nonexpansion states will 
have a greater public health burden related to smoking. Medicaid and public health agencies 
should work together to make smoking cessation a priority for Medicaid beneficiaries.
Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease in the United States[1] and places a 
particularly heavy burden on Medicaid, the nation’s largest health insurance program. 
Medicaid enrollees are about twice as likely to be current smokers (32 percent) as the 
general US population (17 percent), based on our analyses of 2014 data from the National 
Health Interview Survey. A recent surgeon general’s report estimated that 15 percent of all 
Medicaid expenditures are attributable to smoking—an amount equal to about $40 billion in 
2010.[1] Given projected program growth,[2,3] the cost of smoking-related diseases in 
Medicaid alone could rise to more than $75 billion by 2016 (authors’ estimate).
Tobacco is addictive. Stopping smoking is difficult, and attempts to quit are often short-
lived. Nonetheless, efforts to quit are an effective way to reduce the health consequences 
and medical costs of smoking, and even temporary breaks from smoking can be helpful.[4–
6] Increasing tobacco cessation efforts among Medicaid enrollees is a key public health 
objective. For example, the objectives of Healthy People 2020 include reducing smoking 
among adults, increasing smoking cessation efforts, and expanding Medicaid coverage of 
evidence-based cessation efforts.[7] The Department of Health and Human Services’ 
strategic action plan to control tobacco use has similar goals.[8]
Strengthening Medicaid’s commitment to tobacco cessation could reduce morbidity, 
mortality, and Medicaid costs.[1,9] One study estimated that $1 invested in tobacco 
cessation lowered Medicaid expenditures by about $3 because of a rapid reduction in

 hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease.[10] Other research has examined how improved 
cessation could yield savings for states.[11]
Each state administers its own Medicaid program, establishing most policies and operational 
practices within a federal regulatory framework. States historically had great flexibility in 
establishing Medicaid policies, such as whether to cover smoking cessation medications or 
counseling and whether to charge copayments. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) required 
that all state Medicaid programs cover at least some tobacco cessation medications for all 
enrollees and offer comprehensive tobacco cessation benefits without cost sharing for 
pregnant women and for populations made newly eligible under Medicaid expansion. 
However, states retain flexibility in many areas, as discussed below.[12]
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and others have monitored state 
Medicaid benefit policies, determining which medications approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and what types of counseling are covered.[13,14] As of 2014, all 
states covered at least some tobacco cessation medications, but many had restrictions such 
as prior authorization (thirty-six states) or copayments (thirty-six states) that could reduce 
use of the medications.
Although all states must cover tobacco cessation counseling for pregnant women, limitations 
exist for other populations: Nine states do not cover counseling for nonpregnant Medicaid 
enrollees, and many states cover some forms of counseling but not others. Policies can even 
vary within a state, since many enrollees are served by managed care plans that might differ 
in the benefits they cover.
Most smokers want to quit.[15] However, this article shows that many Medicaid enrollees 
who smoke do not get help in quitting, even though the program provides smoking cessation 
benefits. Barriers such as cost sharing and prior authorization requirements, as well as 
enrollees’ lack of knowledge or encouragement, limit access and utilization. For example, 
previous research found that a majority of smokers and many health care providers did not 
realize that Medicaid covered tobacco cessation services.[16,17] More recently, fewer than 
half of the smokers in Medicaid managed care plans reported that their physicians offered 
assistance such as medications or counseling patients to quit.[18] To address these gaps, 
some states have initiated education and outreach programs to promote smoking cessation 
among Medicaid enrollees—but most states have not.
This article provides the first report on state Medicaid programs’ success in smoking 
cessation, based on the use of cessation pharmacotherapy in the period 2010–13. Such use is 
a more direct measure of tobacco cessation efforts than benefit coverage policies. 
Medication and counseling are both important. However, previous research has found that 
medications are the primary form of therapy used in Medicaid: Counseling is used much less 
often and typically in conjunction with medication.[10,19] Previous Medicaid research has 
focused on medication claims as the primary measure of the use of cessation benefits.[20]
Brief counseling may be provided by physicians or others as part of general office visits, but 
such counseling is typically not reported in claims data. Some counseling may also be 
provided through quit lines or text messaging programs, but that is not reported in claims

 data, either. Quit lines are toll-free telephone lines through which counseling and, in some 
cases, medications are available to help people stop smoking. Some of the medications 
provided are not covered by Medicaid.
The estimates reported here were based on data about the level of use and cost of 
prescriptions (either fills or refills, but not including unfilled prescriptions) paid for by state 
Medicaid programs. We focused on FDA-approved tobacco cessation medications: nicotine 
replacement therapies such as gum, patch, inhaler, spray, or lozenge; bupropion (which has 
generic and brand-name versions, including Zyban); and varenicline (brand-name Chantix). 
All of these medications seek to reduce the cravings associated with nicotine withdrawal to 
make it easier to stop smoking. Nicotine replacement therapies use lower levels of nicotine 
to gradually wean smokers from tobacco. Bupropion and varenicline ease tobacco 
withdrawal through other neurological mechanisms.[21]
Study Data And Methods
Data
We accessed Medicaid drug utilization files from CMS.[22,23] State Medicaid agencies 
submit these data to CMS quarterly to determine the level of Medicaid drug rebates. 
Virtually all outpatient drugs paid for by Medicaid earn the program rebates from the drugs’ 
manufacturers, and the rebates totaled over $16 billion in 2013 alone.[24] The files show 
each state Medicaid program’s aggregate volume and payment levels for prescriptions, listed 
by National Drug Code—which gives access to detailed information such as the drug’s 
name, manufacturer, dosage level, and formulation. The drugs include over-the-counter 
medications, such as nicotine gum, paid for by Medicaid after the patient receives a 
physician’s prescription.
Because of changing drug and rebate policies, we focused on the period 2010–13. Before 
August 2010 drug rebates were available only for fee-for-service claims paid directly by a 
Medicaid agency. But beginning in that month the ACA required rebates for drugs provided 
by Medicaid managed care organizations, so reporting became more complete.[25] 
Medicaid agencies were required to report the volume of medications purchased on a fee-
for-service basis. Although Medicaid managed care organizations were not required to 
report drug purchases to the state before 2010, some states “carved out” drugs from 
managed care and paid for them on that basis.
The application of rebates to managed care later widened the scope of drug rebates and 
required managed care organizations to report drug data. An early audit found that by 2011 
most states were collecting the required rebate and utilization data and taking steps to verify 
the data. According to that audit, with support from CMS almost all states were on track to 
collect the data by 2012.[26]
We selected utilization data for all FDA-approved tobacco cessation medications (nicotine 
replacement therapies, bupropion, and varenicline). The main unit of analysis for tobacco 
cessation utilization was a prescription fill or refill, both of which in Medicaid are generally 
for one month or thirty days. (Below we refer prescription fills or refills as prescriptions.)

 Analyses
We restricted our analyses of bupropion usage to the 150 mg twelve-hour formulation, 
which is the form usually recommended for smoking cessation.[27,28] Bupropion is an 
antidepressant that is also prescribed for mental health conditions. Prescriptions written by 
doctors do not report the diagnoses associated with the medications, which makes it 
impossible to accurately determine if bupropion was prescribed for smoking or depression. 
A further complication is that smoking is linked to depression: Depression increases 
smoking, and vice versa.[29,30] In many cases, bupropion may be prescribed for both 
problems. Using only prescriptions for the 150 mg twelve-hour formulation yields more 
conservative estimates of the use of this medication for smoking cessation. It is plausible, 
however, that this formulation is sometimes prescribed for mental health conditions and that 
other formulations are sometimes prescribed for smoking cessation.
Under ideal circumstances, the appropriate denominator for data about smoking cessation 
would be the annual number of smokers enrolled in Medicaid in each state. Unfortunately, 
such data are not directly available. Medicaid enrollment data do not include smoking status. 
The National Health Interview Survey collects data about the smoking status of Medicaid 
enrollees, but the CDC does not offer public access to state identifiers or permit state-level 
reporting. The Tobacco Use Supplement to the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey 
contains information on smoking status but is not available annually (it was last conducted 
in 2011–12), and state sample sizes are limited.
Instead, we estimated smoking status using the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System (BRFSS) for the period 2010–13. The system reports the percentage of low-income 
(earning under $20,000 annually) insured adults who were smokers in each state.[31] 
Medicaid status is not available for all states in the BRFSS. We used low-income insured 
adults as a proxy since the great majority of low-income insured adults are Medicaid 
enrollees. BRFSS data are collected annually from a very large sample designed to represent 
states and are the most widely used data about state-level smoking prevalence.[32,33] 
Annual reporting allowed us to account for changes in smoking prevalence and insurance 
coverage over time. Our analysis of 2013 National Health Interview Survey data found that 
low-income privately insured adults were less likely to smoke than low-income adults 
enrolled in Medicaid. Thus, our estimates—which include both low-income adults with 
private insurance and those with Medicaid—are conservative and may slightly 
underestimate Medicaid smoking prevalence.
To estimate the number of adult Medicaid enrollees who smoked in the period 2010–13, we 
multiplied the percentage of low-income insured smokers in each state by the number of 
adult Medicaid enrollees (including nonelderly adult and elderly or disabled enrollees) in 
December each year.[34,35]
To help put these estimates in perspective, we then translated them into estimates of the 
percentage of adult Medicaid smokers who received tobacco cessation prescriptions in each 
state in each year. The drug utilization data did not directly reveal how many people 
received these prescriptions each year, so we generated a rough estimate based on typical 
usage. A CDC analysis of Medicaid claims data for 1999–2008 found that one to two

 prescriptions per year was most common (Ann Malarcher and Paul Mowery, CDC, personal 
communication, January 25, 2015). Our analyses of 2010 Medicaid claims data from 
Mississippi and Oregon indicated that two to three prescriptions per year were typical.
In this study we assumed that a typical Medicaid smoker received two prescriptions per 
year. This is a rough estimate: If the actual level was closer to 1.5 prescriptions per year, 
then about one-third more of the smokers got medications, while if the level was closer to 
2.5 per year, then one-fifth fewer of the smokers did.
Limitations
Our study had several limitations. First, reporting of drug utilization may be subject to error, 
although the linkage of the data to a multibillion-dollar rebate system creates strong 
incentives for thorough reporting. An audit indicated modest reporting gaps in the first year 
or two of reporting, but these were being fixed in subsequent years.[26]
Second, the data show how many prescriptions were filled, but not if the medications were 
taken or who took them. Some Medicaid enrollees may receive medications or counseling 
outside of Medicaid (for example, through quit lines).
Third, since bupropion may be used for smoking cessation or depression, there is uncertainty 
about why it was prescribed. To be conservative, we included only bupropion in the 150 mg 
twelve-hour formulation, as explained above. In alternative analyses, we eliminated 
bupropion: This halved the total volume of prescriptions, but most patterns were similar to 
those in our main analysis. The differences in utilization between expansion and 
nonexpansion states increased when bupropion was excluded.
Fourth, survey data were used to estimate the percentage of low-income insured enrollees 
who smoked in each state, but these data are subject to reporting and sampling errors about 
smoking and insurance status. BRFSS data do not report Medicaid coverage, although most 
low-income insured adults are on Medicaid. Because people with private insurance are less 
likely to smoke than people with Medicaid, we may have underestimated the prevalence of 
smoking among Medicaid enrollees.
Finally, this study examined the use of tobacco cessation medications, but it did not shed 
light on how many people quit smoking or on the health consequences. These issues will be 
examined in future research.
Study Results
The number of prescriptions for tobacco cessation medications climbed from 1.5 million in 
2010 to 1.8 million in 2011 and then declined to 1.7 million in 2013 (Exhibit 1). The 
apparent increase between 2010 and 2011 may be attributable to the gradual inclusion of 
managed care prescriptions in the Medicaid drug utilization files, which began in 2010. In 
each year of the study period, about half of all prescriptions were for bupropion. 
Varenicline’s share declined from 22 percent in 2010 to 16 percent in 2013, while nicotine 
replacement therapies’ share rose from 28 percent to 34 percent.

 Assuming an annual average of two prescription fills per person, we found that about 10 
percent of adult Medicaid smokers received tobacco cessation medications each year, or 
around 830,000 people in 2013. The prevalence of smoking appeared to rise in 2011 and 
then fall in the following two years. This reduction caused the estimated number of low-
income insured adult smokers to decline from 8.85 million in 2011 to 8.3 million in 2013.
Average utilization rates of tobacco cessation medications were 0.18 prescriptions per 
Medicaid smoker in 2010 and 0.20 prescriptions in the period 2011–13. The slight increase 
between 2010 and 2011 may be an artifact of expanded reporting by managed care plans. 
From 2011 to 2013 the utilization rate per smoker was relatively steady. However, the 
number of prescriptions declined slightly as a result of reductions in the prevalence of 
smoking.
Medicaid programs spent $103 million in 2013 for tobacco cessation medications (nominal 
costs, not adjusted for inflation), before drug rebates were applied (Exhibit 2). Rebate levels 
are not public, but an overall discount of 10–15 percent seems plausible. On a per 
prescription basis, varenicline was more expensive than bupropion or nicotine replacement 
therapies. However, evidence suggests that varenicline may be more effective in promoting 
quitting.[6] The average costs of bupropion and nicotine replacement therapies declined 
from 2010 to 2013, while the average cost of varenicline increased.
Southern states tend to have lower rates of tobacco cessation efforts than Northeastern states 
(Exhibit 3). Utilization rates vary greatly across the states, with more than a thirtyfold 
difference between the states with the highest (Minnesota, at 0.530 prescription per smoker) 
and lowest rates (Texas, at 0.014 prescription per smoker) (Exhibit 4). The states with 
utilization rates above 0.30 were Arizona, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New 
Hampshire, Oregon, Utah, and Wisconsin. The states with rates below 0.075 were Alabama, 
Arkansas, Kansas, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Texas.
Medicaid expansion decisions affect the number of adults who could get tobacco cessation 
benefits. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia expanded or planned to expand 
Medicaid as of June 2015, while twenty-one states were not planning to do so.[36]
Nationwide, 30 percent of Medicaid adults smoke and have an average utilization rate of 
0.20 prescription per smoker per year, so about 10 percent of Medicaid smokers receive 
cessation medications. Medicaid expansion states tend to have lower smoking prevalence 
and higher rates of tobacco cessation medication use (on average, 25 percent of adult 
enrollees smoke, the utilization rate is 0.23 prescription per smoker, and about 12 percent of 
smokers receive cessation medications), compared to nonexpansion states (on average, 32 
percent of adult enrollees smoke, the utilization rate is 0.14 prescription per smoker, and 
about 7 percent of Medicaid smokers receive cessation therapy).
Discussion
The promotion of tobacco cessation should be an important Medicaid policy objective. 
About one-third of adult Medicaid enrollees smoke, making them a high-risk population.[1] 
As Medicaid expands, it is serving millions more adults, many of whom smoke. Thus,

 Medicaid is in a position to considerably expand the number of people who can get help 
with quitting smoking. Nonetheless, this study shows that in most states only a small share 
of smokers access cessation benefits. Given that smoking-related illnesses cost Medicaid 
tens of billions of dollars each year,[1] it is worrisome that only $103 million was spent in 
2013 on medications to help smokers quit, which is less than 0.25 percent of the cost of 
smoking-related diseases.
Our estimates suggest that roughly one-tenth of adult smokers in Medicaid received tobacco 
cessation medications in 2013. However, states’ utilization rates differed markedly, with the 
rate in Minnesota more than thirty times higher than that in Texas.
We are conducting research to understand reasons for the differences across states. 
Sociocultural factors, Medicaid and public health policies and practices, and other policies 
and laws (such as imposing cigarette taxes and creating smoke-free areas) probably play a 
role. In some states where utilization rates of tobacco cessation medications are high—such 
as Massachusetts[37,38] and Wisconsin[20]—public health and Medicaid officials 
collaborated to develop education campaigns promoting smoking cessation among Medicaid 
enrollees. Other states, such as Arizona or New Hampshire, have reduced barriers that might 
discourage smoking cessation by not requiring prior authorization for Medicaid tobacco 
cessation medications.
Jessica Greene and coauthors found that states without copayments for medications or 
counseling had better rates of Medicaid enrollees who quit smoking, compared to states that 
charged copayments.[39] Another study found that copayments diminished the likelihood 
that postpartum women would fill their prescriptions.[40]
Medicaid expansion states usually have lower smoking prevalence and greater use of 
tobacco cessation, compared to nonexpansion states. We do not believe that differences in 
smoking or tobacco cessation rates are caused by states’ decisions about expanding 
Medicaid. These patterns began long before those decisions were made, and there are 
examples of high and low smoking prevalence and cessation among both expanding and 
nonexpanding states.
Nonetheless, the differences have serious public health consequences. By covering more 
people, expansion states make tobacco cessation more broadly available, expanding its 
potential public health impact. Nonexpansion states cover fewer people and already have 
higher smoking prevalence, so they will experience a greater health burden, compared to 
expansion states.
Medication for tobacco cessation is seriously underused in most state Medicaid programs. It 
is not known what the highest attainable utilization rate of medication is. However, the 
enormous discrepancies across states demonstrate that most states could do much more to 
achieve higher rates. Medicaid agencies, working with public health agencies, can make it a 
priority to increase tobacco cessation for Medicaid enrollees.[41]
Most smokers want to quit but need help both to try and to succeed.[1] Patients must be 
engaged and willing to try to quit. Clinicians, insurers, and public agencies can help

 motivate and support people’s efforts to quit through medication and counseling. However, 
they need to understand patients’ needs and realize that not everyone can quit and that some 
people may need to make many attempts to quit. The gains from even modest reductions in 
smoking or from moderate periods of abstinence can be substantial. Thus, increased tobacco 
cessation efforts could lead to substantial reductions in the prevalence of smoking, which 
could in turn reap substantial health benefits.[42]
Medicaid pays for medications and counseling, but more can be done. Medicaid policies 
such as cost sharing or prior authorization that limit access to these benefits should be 
reviewed.[43] States can work with managed care plans to strengthen education of both 
patients and clinicians and monitoring of smoking and tobacco cessation.[44] Tobacco 
cessation is one of CMS’s recommended core adult Medicaid quality measures, but 
performance measures for smoking cessation should be used more consistently.[18]
Conclusion
Medicaid agencies can play a leadership role—collaborating with public health agencies, 
managed care plans, and other stakeholders such as physician groups and health advocacy 
organizations—in actively promoting tobacco cessation for low-income populations covered 
by Medicaid. All state health departments operate smoking quit lines, which are eligible for 
Medicaid funding under CMS policy.[45] Many states, but not all, have established 
collaborative efforts.[46] Text messaging, like quit lines, is a promising approach to patient 
engagement that can be supported by Medicaid.[47]
The fundamental challenges are informing health care providers and patients about the 
importance of stopping smoking and engaging them in cessation efforts, making 
medications and counseling available, and developing innovative strategies to help patients 
change their behavior. As the US health system seeks to focus on population health, 
Medicaid and public health agencies can make important contributions to efforts to improve 
health and lower health costs by preventing smoking in the first place and helping those who 
smoke to quit.
