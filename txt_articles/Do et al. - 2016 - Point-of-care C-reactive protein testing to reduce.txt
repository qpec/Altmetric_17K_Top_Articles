Summary
Background Inappropriate antibiotic use for acute respiratory tract infections is common in primary health care, but 
distinguishing serious from self-limiting infections is diffi
  cult, particularly in low-resource settings. We assessed 
whether C-reactive protein point-of-care testing can safely reduce antibiotic use in patients with non-severe acute 
respiratory tract infections in Vietnam.
Method We did a multicentre open-label randomised controlled trial in ten primary health-care centres in northern 
Vietnam. Patients aged 1–65 years with at least one focal and one systemic symptom of acute respiratory tract infection 
were assigned 1:1 to receive either C-reactive protein point-of-care testing or routine care, following which antibiotic 
prescribing decisions were made. Patients with severe acute respiratory tract infection were excluded. Enrolled 
patients were reassessed on day 3, 4, or 5, and on day 14 a structured telephone interview was done blind to the 
intervention. Randomised assignments were concealed from prescribers and patients but not masked as the test 
result was used to assist treatment decisions. The primary outcome was antibiotic use within 14 days of follow-up. All 
analyses were prespecifi
 ed in the protocol and the statistical analysis plan. All analyses were done on the intention-to-
treat population and the analysis of the primary endpoint was repeated in the per-protocol population. This trial is 
registered under number NCT01918579.
Findings Between March 17, 2014, and July 3, 2015, 2037 patients (1028 children and 1009 adults) were enrolled and 
randomised. One adult patient withdrew immediately after randomisation. 1017 patients were assigned to receive 
C-reactive protein point-of-care testing, and 1019 patients were assigned to receive routine care. 115 patients in the 
C-reactive protein point-of-care group and 72 patients in the routine care group were excluded in the intention-to-treat 
analysis due to missing primary endpoint. The number of patients who used antibiotics within 14 days was 581 (64%) 
of 902 patients in the C-reactive protein group versus 738 (78%) of 947 patients in the control group (odds ratio 
[OR] 0·49, 95% CI 0·40–0·61; p<0·0001). Highly signifi
 cant diff
 erences were seen in both children and adults, with 
substantial heterogeneity of the intervention eff
 ect across the 10 sites (I²=84%, 95% CI 66–96). 140 patients in the 
C-reactive protein group and 137 patients in the routine care group missed the urine test on day 3, 4, or 5. Antibiotic 
activity in urine on day 3, 4, or 5 was found in 267 (30%) of 877 patients in the C-reactive protein group versus 
314 (36%) of 882 patients in the routine treatment group (OR 0·78, 95% CI 0·63–0·95; p=0·015). Time to resolution 
of symptoms was similar in both groups. Adverse events were rare, with no deaths and a total of 14 hospital admissions 
(six in the C-reactive protein group and eight in the control group).
Interpretation C-reactive protein point-of-care testing reduced antibiotic use for non-severe acute respiratory tract 
infection without compromising patients’ recovery in primary health care in Vietnam. Health-care providers might 
have become familiar with the clinical picture of low C-reactive protein, leading to reduction in antibiotic prescribing 
in both groups, but this would have led to a reduction in observed eff
 ect, rather than overestimation. Qualitative 
analysis is needed to address diff
 erences in context in order to implement this strategy to improve rational antibiotic 
use for patients with acute respiratory infection in low-income and middle-income countries.

Introduction
Worldwide, bacterial pathogens are becoming in-
creasingly resistant to antibiotics. This problem is 
particularly pressing in developing countries, where the 
burden of infectious disease is high and availability of 
newer, more expensive antibiotics is low.1
Vietnam already has a lot of antibiotic resistance. 
Prevalence of penicillin resistance is 71% and 
erythromycin resistance is 92% for Streptococcus 
pneumoniae in Vietnam, the highest in Asia.2 Carbapenem 
resistance is high in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%) 
and Acinetobacter baumannii (40%) hospital-acquired

infec 
tions.3 Development of resistance is multifactorial 
but a major driver is likely to be the frequent and often 
injudicious use of antibiotics in people and widespread 
use in agriculture and aquaculture.4 In Vietnam, most 
antibiotics are purchased in private pharmacies without a 
prescription (88% in urban regions and 91% in rural 
regions), mostly for cough.5
In the community setting, most inappropriate anti-
biotics are prescribed or dispensed for acute respiratory 
tract infections, which are often self-limiting, in primary 
health centres or pharmacies.6,7 Although data concerning 
the drivers of prescribing in primary health care in 
Vietnam are scarce, one of the main reasons identifi
 ed is 
diagnostic uncertainty.8 Distinguishing serious from self-
limiting acute respiratory tract infection is challenging, 
and typically relies solely upon careful history and 
examination. Concerns of missing a serious infection 
can precipitate antibiotic prescription. In low-income 
settings, where health infrastructure is less developed, 
physicians might also be concerned about patients’ 
perceived or actual inability to access health care if their 
condition deteriorates. These factors can motivate 
overuse of antibiotics. Implementation of a rapid, 
aff
 ordable point-of-care test to aid diagnosis and 
management and reduce antibiotic use safely is therefore 
an attractive prospect.
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a biomarker for the 
presence of an infl
 ammatory process.9,10 Several studies 
in high-income countries have shown that primary 
health-care providers who used a point-of-care CRP test 
prescribed fewer antibiotics in patients with cough, 
without adversely aff
 ecting patient recovery.11,12 No such 
trials have been done in the primary health-care setting 
of low-income and middle-income countries where 
unrestricted 
antimicrobial 
access 
and 
antibiotic 
resistance is highest, and diff
 erent social and clinical 
factors might aff
 ect its impact. Given the large number 
of self-limiting acute respiratory tract infections that 
present to primary care in Vietnam, even modest 
reductions would greatly decrease the absolute number 
of antibiotic prescriptions and thus one of the major 
drivers for bacterial resistance. Children in particular are 
frequently prescribed inappropriate antibiotics for acute 
respiratory tract infection, and any study should also 
address this important group.7
This study set out to assess the effi
  cacy of CRP point-of-
care testing for both children and adults presenting with 
non-severe acute respiratory tract infections at primary 
health-care centres in Vietnam to reduce inappropriate 
antibiotic use safely.
Methods
Study design
We did an open-label randomised controlled trial in ten 
selected primary health-care centres in northern 
Vietnam. Patients presenting with non-severe acute 
respiratory tract infection were randomly assigned to 
either CRP point-of-care testing (intervention) or routine 
care (control). Randomised assignments were concealed 
from prescribers and patients but not masked as the test 
result was used to assist treatment decisions.
Public health services in Vietnam are decentralised 
from nation to province, district and commune level. 
Primary health care (at the district and commune level) 
provides routine and urgent health care and hospital 
referral to the population. We aimed to include ten urban 
and rural primary health-care centres with a caseload of 
at least fi
 ve acute respiratory tract infection cases per day 
within a 60 km radius of Hanoi. For urban centres, we 
invited all 20 existing regional polyclinics to participate; 
three did not respond, two refused to participate, and six 
did not meet the caseload criteria. Therefore we selected 
 
Research in context 
Evidence before this study
In a 2014 Cochrane review, Aabenhus and Jensen searched 
several electronic database including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, 
Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS up to 
January, 2014, and identifi
 ed six trials (three were individual 
randomised controlled trials [RCTs] and three were cluster 
RCTs). They found that cluster RCTs of C-reactive protein (CRP) 
testing was mostly eff
 ective in reducing antibiotic prescription. 
We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library for articles 
published with the combination of “antibiotic”, “primary care”, 
“intervention”, “respiratory tract infection”, “C reactive protein” 
and “point-of-care”. We found no recent trials in addition to 
those already included in the Cochrane review. 
Added value of this study
All previous individual RCTs and cluster RCTs were done in 
European countries. No similar trial has been done in the 
primary health-care setting of low-income or middle-income 
countries, or for children. In the lower-middle-income country 
setting of Vietnam we assessed whether an aff
 ordable and 
practical C-reactive protein point-of-care test can aid in 
reducing antibiotic use safely in both adult and children with 
non-severe acute respiratory infections. 
Implications of all the available evidence
Our fi
 ndings indicate that the intervention could be applied in 
the resource-constrained settings of low-income and 
middle-income countries to improve rational antibiotic use for 
both children and adults with non-severe acute respiratory tract 
infection without compromising patients’ recovery and 
satisfaction. Considerable heterogeneity between the 
ten health-care stations indicates the importance of regular 
review of any intervention and tailoring it to specifi
 c local 
context.

the remaining nine urban sites to implement the trial. 
For rural sites, we selected the outpatient clinics of one 
district general hospital (Ba Vi hospital), situated 60 km 
west of Hanoi. Caseloads of other non-hospital clinics in 
rural Hanoi were too low.
Patients
Patients aged 1–65 years who were visiting one of these 
primary health-care centres, and who were suspected of 
having non-severe acute respiratory tract infection with 
at least one focal and one systemic sign or symptom by 
the treating physician were eligible for this study. Focal 
signs and symptoms were cough, rhinitis, pharyngitis, 
shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, and 
auscultation abnormalities. Systemic signs and symp-
toms were fever, perspiration, headache, myalgia, and 
feeling generally unwell. Children were defi
 ned as 
patients aged 1–15 years. Patients with signs of severe 
acute respiratory tract infection were excluded. Detailed 
general and specifi
 c inclusion and exclusion criteria for 
adults and children are listed in the appendix.
A study doctor or study nurse explained to patients or 
legal guardians about the trial, including risks and 
benefi
 ts. After verbal agreement, written informed 
consent was obtained. Once consent was obtained, a case 
report form was completed for each patient containing 
all the information related to the study variables. All 
patients received a routine medical history and 
examination, consisting of medical history, mental status 
(Glasgow Coma Scale), vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, 
respiratory rate), and temperature. Further examinations 
were done at the discretion of the treating physician.
Randomisation and masking
Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to CRP 
point-of-care testing or control (routine care) using an 
individual randomisation method, stratifi
 ed by health 
station and age category (child versus adult). The 
randomisation list was computer-generated using 
variable block lengths of four (with probability 0·75) and 
six (with probability 0·25). Allocation was concealed by 
opaque sealed envelopes,13 opened at randomisation in 
strict chronological sequence. To protect the patient’s 
identity, each participant was allocated a study 
identifi
 cation number, which was used for all study 
material. Patients and investigators were not masked to 
treatment assignment, except for the conductors of the 
2-week telephone interview, who were blinded to the 
intervention received by the interviewee. 
Procedures
For patients in the intervention group, a fi
 nger prick to 
obtain capillary blood was done and analysed using the 
quantitative NycoCard analyser (CRP single test kit used 
with the NycoCard II Reader, Alere Technologies, 
Norway) on enrolment (day 0) and retested on day 3, 4, 
or 5. Patients in the control group were treated according 
to routine practice and local treatment guidelines on 
enrolment and the second visit. All patients were 
followed up at 2 weeks after the initial health clinic visit 
by a structured telephone interview.
Physicians were trained to use specifi
 c CRP cutoff
 s, 
which were based on previous studies and adapted for 
use in children.12,14–16 We did a central initial training 
workshop, followed by further training during onsite 
implementation visits at the ten health centres by the 
study team. Training followed a model developed for a 
similar study in Maastricht, Netherlands, contextualised 
to the Vietnamese setting and carried out in 
Vietnamese.15,17 Training materials were both verbal and 
written, consisting of oral presentations and written 
information leafl
 ets for the doctors and health centres to 
keep for future reference. The health centres and doctors 
were given a telephone number to contact should any 
queries arise during the study. Laminated posters and 
desk reminders with recommended cutoff
  values for the 
specifi
 c age groups were provided.
The cutoff
 s used to recommend that antibiotics not be 
prescribed were a CRP of 20 mg/L or less for patients 
aged 6–65 years, and a CRP of 10 mg/L or less for 
patients aged 1–5 years. Doctors were advised that adults 
with a CRP of 100 mg/L or more and children with a 
CRP of 50 mg/L or more should generally receive 
antibiotics and hospital referral should be considered. 
Between these thresholds no specifi
 c recommendation 
was given and clinicians were advised to use their 
clinical discretion.
After 2 weeks, enrolled patients were interviewed via 
telephone, by interviewers blinded to the intervention, to 
assess whether they had been to any health clinic, 
whether they had taken any medication for the same 
acute respiratory tract infection, the source of any 
medication, any serious adverse events (eg, admission to 
hospital), time to resolution of acute respiratory tract 
infection symptoms, and satisfaction with the care 
provided. The patients were given a symptom diary as a 
memory aid on day 0.
Doctors requested the patients return to the clinic on day 
3, 4, or 5. Urine samples from enrolled patients (except 
those lost to follow-up, toddlers who could not urinate on 
command at the visit, and women when menstruating) 
were collected by the original clinician on the second visit 
(day 3, 4, or 5) for testing for the presence of antimicrobials. 
Pansensitive ATCC 25923 Staphylococcus aureus and ATCC 
25922 Escherichia coli on Müller Hinton agar (Oxoid) were 
cultured in the presence of the participant’s urine.18,19 We 
used a positive control from a patient who was on antibiotic 
treatment at the time of urine collection. Negative control 
urines were from healthy people who had not taken any 
drug for at least 3 days before urine collection. A positive 
result was a zone of clearing larger than 10 mm diameter 
in either or both agar plates with the two ATCC bacterial 
strains. The sensitivity of this test is reportedly 97·37%, 
and the specifi
 city is around 98·85%.19

Outcomes
The primary endpoint was the number of patients 
receiving any antibiotic within 2 weeks of enrolment. 
Antibiotic use was defi
 ned as at least one of: antibiotic 
prescription at enrolment (day 0), antibiotic use reported 
at follow-up visit (day 3, 4, or 5), antibiotic prescription at 
second visit (day 3, 4, or 5), antimicrobial activity in 
urine, or antibiotic use reported at follow-up interview 
(day 14). Participants were classifi
 ed as positive for 
antibiotic use if at least one of these conditions were met, 
negative if all fi
 ve criteria were documented as negative, 
and missing if all reported criteria were negative but data 
were missing for at least one criterion.
Secondary endpoints were antimicrobial activity in 
urine (day 3, 4, or 5), the proportion of patients with 
immediate antibiotic prescription at enrolment, any 
anti 
biotic 
usage 
in 
patients 
without 
immediate 
prescription (subsequent antibiotic use or intervention 
failure), and prescriptions on the second visit in patients 
without an immediate antibiotic prescription (clinical 
management changed based on follow-up assessment). 
Additional secondary endpoints were the source of any 
antibiotic taken but not prescribed at enrolment or day 4 
(self-medication, drug seller, doctor, or other), the 
frequency of reconsultations, serious adverse events 
(hospital admission or death), time to resolution of 
symptoms, and reported patient satisfaction with 
participating in the trial on day 14 (measured on a scale 
from 0 to 10). Patients with satisfaction score of 5 or 
more were considered satisfi
 ed.
Statistical analysis
We expected CRP guidance to reduce antibiotic 
prescription for acute respiratory tract infection by at 
least 20%: from 80%7 to 60%. However, increased aware-
ness of the issue through the study could itself bring 
antibiotic prescription down, reducing the eff
 ect of CRP 
testing. Therefore, the trial was powered to detect a 
reduction of the antibiotic prescription rate from 70% to 
60%, based on antibiotic use data from communities in 
Vietnam.7 To detect such a diff
 erence with 90% power 
and two-sided 5% signifi
 cance, a total of 477 patients 
were required per arm. To analyse adults and children 
separately, the target sample size was set at 2000 patients 
(50% children and 50% adults).
Statistical analyses were predefi
 ned in the protocol and 
the statistical analysis plan. The main population for all 
analyses was the intention-to-treat population including 
all randomised patients except for those who withdrew 
immediately, and analysis was according to the treatment 
arm. Patients with missing outcomes were excluded 
from the analysis. However, for the primary outcome, we 
also did an additional, alternative analysis based on 
multiple imputation of outcomes for those patients. 
Moreover, the analysis of the primary endpoint was 
repeated in the per-protocol population that included 
only patients for whom all components of the primary 
endpoint as mentioned above were non-missing.
For formal comparison of the composite primary 
endpoint and its components between the two treatment 
groups, we used a logistic regression model of the 
outcome depending on the treatment group and the age 
stratum (children vs adults) as fi
 xed eff
 ects and the 
health-care centre as a random eff
 ect, thereby taking 
clustering within centres into account. Because we saw 
considerable heterogeneity in the primary endpoint 
between health-care centres, we decided post hoc to 
visualise results by site using forest plots and to do a 
standard random eff
 ects meta-analysis.
Time to resolution of symptoms was visualised using 
Kaplan-Meier curves and formal comparisons between 
the two treatment groups were based on the Cox pro-
portional hazards model with the treatment assignment 
and the age stratum as fi
 xed eff
 ects and the health-care 
centre as a Gaussian random eff
 ect (frailty). All data 
derivations were done with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute 
Inc, Cary, USA) and statistical analyses were done with

Results
Patients were enrolled from March 17, 2014, to July 3, 2015. 
Of 3532 patients screened, 1258 did not fulfi
 l inclusion 
criteria, including 417 patients (33%) who had already 
taken antibiotics at presentation, and 237 who declined to 
participate. A total of 2037 patients from 10 centres 
(153–271 patients per site) were enrolled and randomised. 
One patient immediately withdrew after randomisation. 
1017 patients (510 children, 507 adults) were randomly 
assigned to the CRP group and 1019 patients (518 children, 
501 adults) were assigned to the control group. 115 (11%) 
of 1017 patients in the CRP group and 72 (7%) of 
1019 patients in the control group did not have a primary 
outcome. The per-protocol analysis contained 773 patients 
in the CRP group and 761 in the control group (fi
 gure 1).
Characteristics of participants at enrolment were 
similar between both groups regarding age, duration of 
illness, vital signs, and clinical symptoms at presentation. 
1224 (60%) of 2036 patients were female. Symptoms at 
presentation were: cough, sore throat, coryza, fever, 
dyspnoea, and earache (table 1).
In the intention-to-treat analysis, 581 (64%) of 
902 patients in the CRP-guided group and 738 (78%) of 
947 routine care patients used an antibiotic within 14 days 
of follow-up (odds ratio [OR] 0·49, 95% CI 0·40–0·61; 
p<0·0001). The corresponding eff
 ect sizes for the 
intention-to-treat analysis based on multiple imputation 
(0·50, 0·41–0·61; p<0·0001) and the per-protocol analysis 
(0·51, 0·41–0·63; p<0·0001) were similar and signifi
 cant 
reductions were observed in both adults and children 
(table 2). There was substantial heterogeneity between 
the health centres (I²=84%, 95% CI 66–96) and the 
pooled median treatment eff
 ect estimate (OR 0·47) from 
the random treatment eff
 ects model showed therefore a 
much wider 95% CI of 0·26–0·83 (fi
 gure 2).
In the intention-to-treat analysis, immediate antibiotic 
prescription at presentation was higher in the routine 
group (647 [63%] of 1019 patients) than in the CRP group 
(441 [43%] of 1017 patients; OR 0·41, 95% CI 0·34–0·49; 
p<0·0001). This diff
 erence was also signifi
 cant in the 
per-protocol analysis (OR 0·46, 95% CI 0·37–0·57; 
p<0·0001). Signifi
 cantly higher antibiotic prescription at 
presentation in the routine care group was seen in both 
children and adults (table 3).
Substantial heterogeneity in immediate antibiotic use 
between the health centres was detected (I²=94%, 95% CI 
87–98) (appendix). Subsequent antibiotic use without

immediate prescription (intervention failure) within 
14 days of follow-up was similar between the two groups 
at 140 (30%) of 461 patients in the CRP group and 
91 (30%) 300 of patients in the routine care group 
(OR 0·97, 95% CI 0·7–1·35; p=0·85). The corresponding 
eff
 ect size was similar in children and adults (table 3). 
Among 165 patients (72 in the routine care group, 93 in 
the CRP group) who were using antibiotics without 
prescription at enrolment or the second visit, the source 
of antibiotics was recorded in 133 cases. The most 
frequent source was drug-seller-guided antibiotic use 
(66) followed by doctor’s prescription (39) and self-
medication (27), or other sources (1).
Antimicrobial activity in a urine sample on day 3, 4, or 
5 was signifi
 cantly lower in the CRP group than in the 
routine treatment group. In the intention-to-treat 
population, this was detected in 267 (30%) of 877 patients 
in the CRP group versus 314 (36%) of 882 patients in the 
routine treatment group (OR 0·78, 95% CI 0·63–0·95; 
p=0·015) (table 3). Antimicrobial activity was detected in 
444 (47%) of 953 patients receiving immediate antibiotics. 
The agreement between recorded previous antibiotic use 
and detection of antimicrobial activity in the urine 
sample was moderate, with κ=0·43 (95% CI 0·39–0·47). 
In patients without recorded previous antibiotic use, 
46 (9%) of 487 patients in the CRP group and 26 (8%) of 
319 patients in the control group had a positive urine test. 
The number of positive urine tests in patients with 
recorded previous antibiotic use was 221 (57%) of 
390 patients in the CRP group and 288 (51%) 
of 563 of patients in the routine care group. The number 
of positive urine tests in patients with recorded previous 
antibiotic use was lowest in the control group of the rural 
Ba Vi site, with 23 (32%) of 71 patients with a positive 
urine test. In patients who did not receive immediate 
antibiotic prescriptions, the number of patients with a 
prescription of an antibiotic on day 3, 4, or 5 (antibiotic 
management change) was 30 (6%) of 510 patients in the 
CRP group versus 12 (3%) 345 patients in the routine 
group in the intention-to-treat analysis (OR 1·70, 95% CI 
0·85–3·41; p=0·13) (table 3).
Time to resolution of symptoms was similar between 
groups (fi
 gure 3), with a median duration of 5 days 
(IQR 4–7) in both groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0·92, 95% CI 
0·84–1·02) (table 3). Adverse events, defi
 ned as hospital 
admission or death between enrolment and day 14, were 
rare, with zero deaths and 14 hospital admissions (eight 
in the routine treatment group and six in CRP group). 
Three of 1019 patients in the routine group and fi
 ve of 
1017 patients in CRP group needed reconsultation 
(table 3). We detected no diff
 erences in patients’ 
satisfaction between randomised groups (table 3).
758 (75%) of 1017 CRP measurements in patients with 
immediate antibiotic prescription were less than 
10 mg/L, 133 (13%) were 11–20 mg/L, 101 (10%) were 
21–50 mg/L, and only 25 (2%) were more than 50 mg/L.

received immediate antibiotic prescription when the 
CRP value at enrolment was 10 mg/L or less. 171 (37%) of 
459 adults received immediate antibiotic prescription 
when the CRP value at day 0 was 20 mg/L or less 
(appendix). Adherence to the intervention algorithm was 
highly variable across sites. For patients aged 6–65 years 
with a CRP value at day 0 of 20 mg/L or less, the 
immediate antibiotic prescription rate ranged from three 
(4%) of 75 patients (in Sai Dong station) to 49 (71%) of 
69 patients (in Dong Da station).
Discussion
This study shows that access to CRP point-of-care testing 
reduces unnecessary antibiotic use for non-severe acute 
respiratory infections in adults and children in primary 
health care in Vietnam, without compromising clinical 
recovery or serious adverse events. Our fi
 ndings were 
consistent across all outcome measures we used: 
dispensing and prescribing data, patient self-report, and 
microbiologically confi
 rmed antibiotic presence in urine. 
This trial is the fi
 rst to investigate the eff
 ects of CRP 
point-of-care testing in a resource-constrained setting 
and the impact of CRP testing on antibiotic use in 
children has never been assessed before in a randomised 
controlled trial.
With an overall absolute reduction of 14% (78% vs 64%) 
in antibiotic use, the eff
 ect of CRP testing in our trial is 
similar to that reported in the Netherlands, where the 
reduction was 12% (65% vs 53%; risk ratio [RR] 0·81)20 
and higher than in Norway, where a non-signifi
 cant 
reduction was seen (RR 0·95, 95% CI 0·76–1·18).21 
Cluster-randomised controlled trials in the Netherlands 
and Russia showed signifi
 cant reductions of 18%15 and 
15%,14 respectively. The decline in immediate pre 
scription 
rate was also larger in our study than with previous 
individual randomised controlled trials17,21,22 but lower 
than in cluster-randomised controlled trials.12,14,15
There was a high degree of heterogeneity in the eff
 ect of 
CRP point-of-care testing across sites. Several sites 
probably did not adhere to the intervention algorithm. The 
reasons why physicians did not follow the CRP algorithm 
are not known. A full qualitative assessment of the 
intervention was done and will be reported separately. Of 
note, the results of a previous study12 in European countries 
suggests that an intervention combining CRP testing and 
education had the largest eff
 ect on prescribing.
Similar to results from previous trials, no diff
 erences 
regarding recovery, serious adverse events, and patients’ 
satisfaction were seen after the introduction of CRP 
testing, although given the benign clinical syndrome 
addressed it was unlikely to be powered to detect 
diff
 erences in outcome. One trial has previously docu-
mented an increase in hospital admissions associated 
with CRP-guided treatment. However, this adverse event 
was rare (a total of 30 in 4264 patients) and concerns 
regarding this risk should be balanced against benefi
 ts of 
reducing inappropriate antibiotic use on a large scale.12 
Such adverse events were also exceedingly rare in our 
study with no apparent diff
 erence between the groups.
Although most previous large trials only looked at 
prescribing data or self-reporting on antibiotic usage, 
tests of urinary antimicrobial activity provided additional 
information in this study. In comparison to rates of 
immediate antibiotic prescription (43% in the CRP group 
vs 64% in the routine group), rates of detection of urine 
antimicrobial activity were substantially lower: 36% in 
the CRP group versus 30% in the routine group. The 
agreement between recorded antibiotic use and detection 
of antimicrobial activity in urine was only moderate 
(κ=0·43)23 and detection of antimicrobial activity in urine 
was lower in the control group and lowest in the control 
group of the rural Ba Vi site. This might be explained by 
patients stopping their antibiotic treatment before the 
second visit on day 3, 4, or 5 as suggested by a previous 
study among children in rural Vietnam that reported that 
341 (42%) of 818 patients used antibiotics for only 1 or 
2 days.24 A further explanation could be biliary excretion 
of several frequently prescribed antibiotics such as 
azithromycin or spiramycin.
Procalcitonin might be an alternative biomarker to 
CRP. Procalcitonin was shown to be an eff
 ective 
biomarker in reducing antibiotic use for acute respiratory 
tract infections in primary care setting in European 
countries.25–27 However, no well validated point-of-care 
test for procalcitonin that is feasible for use in low-income 
settings is commercially available as far as we are aware. 
Furthermore, a 2015 study28 assessed the diagnostic 
accuracy of procalcitonin and CRP in distinguishing 
common viral and bacterial infections three south Asian 
countries in which malaria is endemic. That study 
indicated that, when applied to samples from febrile 
patients with mono-infections, CRP was a highly 
sensitive and moderately specifi
 c biomarker for 
discriminating viral infections from bacterial infections 
(rickettsiosis/leptospirosis, 
bacteraemia), 
and 
from 
malaria. CRP had a higher sensitivity and specifi
 city in

With the large sample size, our trial was robust to 
assess the intervention eff
 ect in diff
 erent age subgroups 
in a real-life situation. This provides us with relevant data 
on what obstacles need to be overcome to make the 
intervention even more eff
 ective. Our fi
 ndings suggest 
that CRP testing could be an important component 
of non-antibiotic management strategies for acute 
respiratory tract infection in primary care settings in low-
income and middle-income countries. The intervention 
has the potential of being scaled up as several com-
mercially aff
 ordable CRP rapid point-of-care tests have 
been assessed and seen to be reliable.29 Before widely 
introducing CRP point-of-care tests as routine care, a 
cost-eff
 ectiveness analysis should be done to assess other 
additional requirements, including test cost, training, 
and consultation time, compared with the reduction in 
antibiotic prescription and subsequent burden of 
resistance. To achieve maximal impact on antibiotic 
consumption in settings, such as Vietnam, where 
antibiotic use is commonly off
 -prescription, further work 
investigating the potential for point-of-care CRP testing 
in pharmacies and drug stores will be needed. This trial 
provides important data necessary for planning such 
studies. There might be lessons to be learnt from the roll-
out of rapid diagnostic tests in community settings.30
There are several limitations of our study. Over time, 
clinicians might have become familiar with the clinical 
picture associated with low CRP, resulting in reduced 
antibiotic prescriptions even in individuals randomly 
assigned to the control group. A cluster randomised 
controled trial design might have prevented this 
contamination eff
 ect but would be more costly. 
However, this limitation would have led to a reduction 
in the observed eff
 ect rather than an overestimation. 
We might not have captured all antibiotic use by the 
second visit, the diary, urine test, and the day 14 
interview. Patients might not have reported antibiotic 
use due to poor recall or self-perceived misuse of 
antibiotics or were unaware that pills they were given 
were antibiotics. However, this bias should be equally 
distributed across groups. Lastly the heterogeneity of 
the eff
 ect is far from ideal, but is likely to represent 
diff
 erences in context that will be explored further in 
qualitative analyses and must be addressed for 
successful implementation of this strategy.
Antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections was 
signifi
 cantly reduced by C-reactive protein guidance at the 
point of care. We saw a considerable heterogeneity 
between the ten health-care stations, providing important 
lessons for implementation. Our fi
 ndings indicate that 
the intervention could be applied in the resource-
constrained settings of low-income and middle-income 
countries to improve rational antibiotic use for patients 
with acute respiratory tract infection (adults and children) 
without compromising patients’ recovery and satisfac 
tion.
