Vegan diets: practical advice for athletes
and exercisers
David Rogerson
Abstract: With the growth of social media as a platform to share information, veganism is becoming more visible,
and could be becoming more accepted in sports and in the health and fitness industry. However, to date, there
appears to be a lack of literature that discusses how to manage vegan diets for athletic purposes. This article attempted
to review literature in order to provide recommendations for how to construct a vegan diet for athletes and exercisers.
While little data could be found in the sports nutrition literature specifically, it was revealed elsewhere that veganism
creates challenges that need to be accounted for when designing a nutritious diet. This included the sufficiency of
energy and protein; the adequacy of vitamin B12, iron, zinc, calcium, iodine and vitamin D; and the lack of the
long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in most plant-based sources. However, via the strategic management of food
and appropriate supplementation, it is the contention of this article that a nutritive vegan diet can be designed to
achieve the dietary needs of most athletes satisfactorily. Further, it was suggested here that creatine and β-alanine
supplementation might be of particular use to vegan athletes, owing to vegetarian diets promoting lower muscle
creatine and lower muscle carnosine levels in consumers. Empirical research is needed to examine the effects of vegan
diets in athletic populations however, especially if this movement grows in popularity, to ensure that the health and
performance of athletic vegans is optimised in accordance with developments in sports nutrition knowledge.

Background
Vegan diets might be becoming more visible, owing to the
proliferation of social media as a means to share informa-
tion, experiences and discuss opinions [1]. Promoted by
some for alleged health benefits such as reduced risk of
heart disease, lower LDL, blood pressure, type II diabetes
and cancer [2, 3], veganism is a form of vegetarianism that
prohibits the consumption of animal products [4]. Several
high-profile athletes, such as former world heavyweight
champion boxer David Haye and ladies tennis champion
Venus Williams, have reportedly adopted vegan diets in
recent times. Quite often, veganism is the product of
strong ethical beliefs concerning animal welfare, and
vegan activists have been subject to stigma [5], stereotyp-
ing [6] and negative attitudes [7], due in part to their vocal
denigration of animal consumerism. The increased visi-
bility of high-profile vegan competitors might suggest
that veganism could be becoming more appealing for
some, especially if more successful athletes adopt and
publicize their vegan lifestyles.
Poorly constructed vegan diets however might predis-
pose individuals to macronutrient (protein, n-3) and
micronutrient (vitamin B12 and vitamin D; iron, zinc, cal-
cium, iodine) deficiencies [2, 3, 8, 9]. This is of particular
concern if little attention is paid to accommodating for
the nutrients that are excluded due to the elimination
of animal products from the diet [9]. Some have alleged
that a vegan diet could offer potential performance ben-
efits due to the antioxidant (polyphenols), micronutrient
(vitamin C, E) and carbohydrate-rich foods typical of
plant-based diets assisting training and enhancing recov-
ery [10, 11]. However, empirical research validating this
claim is either equivocal or missing [12]. Indeed, there ap-
pears to be a lack of research into veganism in sport in
general, despite interest in literature elsewhere [13]. In
order to ensure that vegan diets meet both health and
performance needs, basic dietary requirements have to
be met and sport-specific diet-related objectives need
to be achieved [9, 14]. The aim of this article is to address
this point, and to provide practical recommendations for
sports dieticians, coaches and trainers who might work
with vegan athletes. Particular attention will be paid to the
achievement of macro and micronutrient requirements

Main Text
The information in this narrative has been extrapolated
from a broad range of academic disciplines, such as the
epidemiological and health sciences, in addition to sports
nutrition literature. This is due to little information being
available that discusses or investigates veganism in sport
and health and fitness-related contexts. Therefore, in
some instances, recommendations provided herein have
yet to be fully authenticated via scientific investigation,
and serve as illustrative concepts until further validation
can be undertaken.
Energy
For most athletes, a well-constructed diet (omnivorous
or otherwise) should provide sufficient energy in order
to achieve energy balance [15]. However, data suggests
that a negative energy balance is common in endurance
athletes and athletes participating in weight-making and
aesthetic sports (such as combat sports, gymnastics,
skating and dancing, etc.) [15]. Very large athletes might
also find it difficult to achieve energy balance, particu-
larly during high-volume training phases [16, 17]. Of
particular concern in sports that require low body mass,
some female athletes might be at risk of developing low
bone-mineral density [18]. This is likely to be exacer-
bated by a poorly-constructed hypocaloric diet [18].
Additionally, high intensity training can reduce appetite
[19], and hectic travel schedules, poor food availability
(whilst abroad or away from home) and gastrointestinal
discomfort might mean that some athletes find it diffi-
cult to meet their energy requirements due to various
factors [17, 20].
The consequences of insufficient energy are important.
Immunity might become compromised, leading to illnesses
and time off from training and competition [15, 21].
Weight loss can ensue, and can lead to the loss of muscle
mass, reduced strength, lower work capacity and a lack of
satisfactory training adaptation [15]. Managing energy
balance is thus important for all athletes, but this issue
is likely to be compounded further when a habitual diet
promotes early satiation and reduced appetite, such as
a vegan diet [3, 4, 8–11]. Well-accepted methods of calcu-
lating energy intake include estimates such as the Cun-
ningham or Harris-Benedict eqs. [22], Dietary Reference
Intakes (DRIs) and/or other literature-based guidelines
can all be used to determine nutrient needs and design di-
ets [17]. The International Society of Sports Nutrition
(ISSN) recommends that energy requirements should be
scaled to activity level, body-mass and mode of exercise
[16], to ensure that individual-specific needs are met [17].
Such recommendations are prudent in light of the pre-
ceding discussion, as well as the likelihood that athletes
possess individual-specific energy and nutrient require-
ments which differ on the basis of sport, training and
competition characteristics [15–17].
Data indicates that vegans consume less energy than
omnivores [8], and research suggests that vegetarian di-
ets generally appear to be lower in protein, fat, vitamin
B12, Riboflavin, vitamin D, calcium, iron and zinc when
compared to an omnivorous diet [8, 14, 23, 24]. Table 1
details vegetarian diets as described in the literature, and
highlights how the diets differ based on the extent of
their restrictions. Some vegan diets promote the consump-
tion of raw foods only, and data suggests that these diets
might lead to poor macronutrient absorption and weight
loss when consumed ad libitum [25]. Vegetarian and
vegan diets can also lead to very high fibre consump-
tion [14, 24, 25], and plant-based foods therefore tend
to have low energy density and promote early satiety
[26]. While these factors might be helpful for weight-
loss purposes [27], these factors might lead to problems
when trying to achieve a high Calorie diet. Where a
high Calorie diet is needed, increasing feeding frequency
[28] and increasing consumption of energy dense foods
such as nuts, seeds and oils [29] might be helpful to en-
sure that Calorie goals are met. Monitoring and adjusting
the diet on the basis of unwanted body mass fluctuations
in such cases would also allow for diets to be tailored to
individuals’ energy and nutrient requirements [30].
Macronutrients
Protein
The role of protein in the athlete’s diet has garnered much
attention over the years, and there has been ongoing de-
bate about whether athletes require greater amounts of

 protein than non-athletic populations [31–33]. The con-
sensus appears to be that athletes require more protein
than the lay population [33, 34]. Data also indicates that
protein requirements should be tailored to reflect sport-
specific and training-goal requirements [35–37]. Typical
recommendations therefore include 1.6–1.7 g ∙ kg−1 ∙ day−1
for strength and power athletes and 1.2–1.4 g ∙ kg−1 ∙ day−1
for endurance-sport athletes—values notably larger than
the 0.8 g ∙ kg−1 ∙ day−1 recommended for most non-active
adults [36, 37]. Values as high as 4.4 g ∙ kg−1 ∙ day−1 have
also been investigated in the literature recently, with
favourable body-composition effects noted as a results of
its composition [38].
The role of protein in the athlete’s diet is multifaceted.
Protein serves as a substrate for exercise performance
and a catalyst for exercise adaptation [32]. The balance
between Muscle Protein Breakdown (MPB) and Muscle
Protein Synthesis (MPS) is known as Net Protein Bal-
ance (NPB). Achieving a positive NPB via elevated MPS
promotes exercise recovery, adaptation and anabolism
[32, 38, 39]. During negative energy balance adaptive
mechanisms preserve Fat Free Mass (FFM) under hypo-
caloric conditions [33, 40]. Despite this, dieting athletes
and bodybuilders might still require elevated protein
intakes due to the need to preserve lean mass and pro-
mote satiety [33, 39]. Concurrent resistance and endur-
ance training might also compound the need for extra
protein during a hypocaloric diet [33, 39]. Athletes in-
volved in weight-categorised and aesthetic sports need
to be cognisant of optimizing protein intakes, where
the preservation of FFM and optimization of relative
strength is likely to be advantageous to performance.
The ISSN provides a broad protein recommendation of
1.4–2.0 g ∙ kg ∙ day−1, which is likely to be appropriate
for most athletic contexts [34]. However, for athletes in
need of losing body-mass, recommendations of up to
1.8–2.7 g ∙ kg ∙ day−1 have been provided in literature
[33, 39], and values as high as 2.3–3.2 g ∙ kg ∙ FFM ∙ day−1
have been suggested for bodybuilders aiming to achieve
competition-level leanness [39].
Vegan athletes however appear to consume less protein
than their omnivorous and vegetarian counterparts [11].
The optimisation of protein intakes for vegan athlete re-
quires that attention is paid to the quantity and quality of
protein consumed [41]. Plant-based protein sources are
often incomplete, missing important essential amino acids,
and typically contain less Branched Chain Amino Acids
(BCAA) than their animal-based equivalents [34, 35]. Leu-
cine appears to be a primary trigger of MPS, and plays an
important role in promoting recovery and adaptation from
exercise [32, 34, 41]. Interestingly, evidence suggests that
milk-based proteins might be superior to other protein
sources at promoting MPS, mediated in part by the rich-
ness of its BCAA content [42, 43]. Similarly, the habitual
consumption of milk as part of a diet and resistance-
training programme might lead to better muscle hyper-
trophy when compared to a soy-protein-supplemented
equivalent [44, 45]. This is might be due to milk’s superior
amino acid composition [45]. Indeed, plant-based proteins
often lack essential amino acids [46], and animal-based
proteins therefore possess a greater biological value due to
the presence of all essential amino acids in the food [46].
Common examples of the limiting amino acids in plant-
based proteins include lysine, methionine, isoleucine,
threonine and tryptophan. Of these, lysine appears to be
to be most commonly absent, particularly from cereal
grains [46]. Foods such as beans and legumes are rich
sources of lysine however, and leucine can be obtained
from soy beans and lentils. Other BCAAs can be found in
seeds, tree nuts and chickpeas, meaning that these amino
acids can be obtained by consuming a variety of protein-
rich, plant-based foods [14, 46]. Indeed, the Academy of
Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) have recommended that a
range of plant-based proteins should be consumed by
vegetarians in order to meet their protein and amino
acid requirements [47]. Further, the once-popular rec-
ommendation of combining protein sources to achieve
a complete essential amino acid profile in each feeding
is no longer considered necessary [14]. Foods such as
grains, legumes, nuts and seeds should be included in
the vegan diet to ensure that all EAAs are present, and
that adequate BCAA are consumed to support recovery
and adaptation from training. Examples of high-protein
vegan-friendly foods can be found in Table 2.
Plant-based protein supplements that feature in the lit-
erature and are commercially available include soy (and
soy isolate), pea, rice, hemp and composite/blended pro-
tein products [45–48]. Supplemental protein might be of
interest to vegan athletes, particularly if achieving sufficient
protein via wholefoods is either difficult or inconvenient.
Emerging data is beginning to support the efficacy of
plant-based-protein powders at improving recovery from
training [48] and fostering muscle hypertrophy as part of a
resistance training program [45]. Recent evidence also sug-
gests like-for-like responses when comparing supplemental

 plant and dairy proteins on body composition and exercise
performance as part of a training programme [48], con-
trasting previously-reported data [45]. In comparison to
dairy-based protein supplements however, plant-based sup-
plements appear to be much less researched at this time,
and further research is needed to understand the effects of
individual (rice, pea, hemp, etc.) and blended products on
postprandial MPS [49].
Protein digestibility
The digestibility of plant-based protein appears to be
markedly less than that of animal products, which might
need to be accounted for when designing a vegan diet
[50]. The Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid
Score (PDCAAS) and Digestible Indispensable Amino
Acid Score (DIAAS) are metrics that rate the quality of
proteins based on their digestibility [51]. The PDCAAS
has been criticised for disregarding anti-nutrient factors
that affect protein absorption, and for truncating protein
sources that score in excess of its 1.0 ceiling [51]. The
DIAAS does neither, and is perhaps a superior system
for rating protein digestibility [41, 51]. Both systems
however indicate that animal-derived proteins score
higher than plant-based sources [51]. Interestingly, soy
protein possesses a PDCAAS of 1.0 and appears to be
comparable to whey protein isolate. However, when fac-
toring in anti-nutrient factors such as phytic acid and
trypsin inhibitors, which limit the absorption of nutrients,
whey protein isolate appears to be superior to soy protein
when using the DIAAS (1.09 vs. 0.91) [41]. Other import-
ant plant-based protein sources such as rice, peas and
hemp all score markedly lower than animal-based
sources such as eggs, chicken and beef using either system
[41, 51, 52]. Indeed, it has been suggested that vegetarians
might need to consume more protein than meat eaters to
compensate for the poorer digestibility of plant-based
sources [50]. Values of up to 1.0 g ∙ kg−1 ∙ day−1 (vs. the
RDA’s 0.8 g ∙ kg−1 ∙ day−1) have been suggested for a non-
athletic, vegetarian population, who might consume eggs
and dairy products in addition to plant-based proteins
[50]. Due to the absence of all animal proteins in the diet,
it might be prudent for vegan athletes to aim for protein
intakes towards the higher end of the ISSN’s protein rec-
ommendation of 1.4 to 2.0 g ∙ kg ∙ day−1, whilst in an
energy-neutral or energy-positive state. In some instances,
values of up to 1.8 g ∙ kg−1 to 2.7 g ∙ kg ∙ day−1 might be
appropriate during weight loss phases, to compensate
for the reduced digestibility and low biological value of
plant-based sources [33, 39].
Carbohydrate
Vegan diets tend to be higher in carbohydrates, fibre,
fruits, vegetables, antioxidants and phytochemicals than
omnivorous diets [53]. The consumption of micronutrient
and phytochemical-rich foods is an important benefit of
any plant-based diet [3, 9]. This might help to mitigate the
effects of excess inflammation and promote recovery from
training, although this has yet to be confirmed empirically
[10, 12]. It has been suggested that some endurance ath-
letes might intentionally adopt a vegan diet in order to
meet their carbohydrate needs, or to assist weight man-
agement goals [10, 11, 54]. Carbohydrate requirements in
sport has been the focus of literature debate for some time
[55], and athletic diets generally require carbohydrate in-
takes of 4 to 12 g ∙ kg−1 to support high training volumes,
depending on the mode of exercise, the athlete’s gender
and goal of the athlete’s diet [17].
Achieving an adequate carbohydrate intake via a vegan
diet is relatively straightforward, and grains, legumes,
beans, tubers, root vegetables and fruits can all be con-
sumed to meet carbohydrate requirements satisfactorily.
In order to achieve sufficient protein via the consump-
tion of whole foods as recommended in this article, it is
recommended that vegans consume beans, pulses, lentils
and grains daily—foods that are also abundant in carbo-
hydrate. However, recall that these foodstuffs are rich
sources of fibre. Fibrous, non-digestible carbohydrates
and lignin provide volume and bulk, are resistant to di-
gestion and absorption, and promote early satiation and
enhance prolonged satiety signalling [47, 56, 57]. For
athletes requiring higher energy intakes, the consump-
tion of fibre-rich foods to achieve protein and carbohy-
drate adequacy might prove to be difficult for some. Due
to the lectins in foods such as beans, grains, nuts and
potatoes [58], as well as the fermentation of resistant
starch and indigestible carbohydrates (found in oats, peas,
beans, fruits, and in certain vegetables and lentils), a high-
fibre diet can also promote gastric distress in some
cases [38, 59, 60]. In order to achieve sufficient carbo-
hydrate for the athletes involved in high-volume train-
ing phases it might be appropriate (in some contexts)
to choose some lower-fibre foods when developing
high-carbohydrate meals, as long as sufficient micro-
nutrient status (particularly B vitamins) can be ensured.
Foods such as rice, pasta, noodles and buckwheat contain
less fibre than oats, lentils, beans and wholegrain breads,
and removing the skin from tubers and root vegetables re-
duces the fibre contents of these foods whilst maintaining
decent carbohydrate levels.
Carbohydrate timing and supplementation
The optimisation of carbohydrate consumption with re-
spect to training and competition has been debated in
the literature [61]. Conventional wisdom suggests that
maintaining high muscle glycogen stores (achieved via a
carbohydrate-rich diet), consuming carbohydrates before
and during exercise (scaled to absolute intensity and
mode of exercise), consuming multiple-transportable
Rogerson Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2017) 14:36 
Page 4 of 15
 carbohydrates (such as a glucose-fructose mixture), and
carbohydrate mouth rinsing (to delay fatigue) might en-
hance performance during middle-distance and endurance
events [37, 62]. The effects of carbohydrate consumption
before and during short-duration high-intensity sports are
equivocal [36], however carbohydrate feedings 0–60 min
prior to exercise have been indicated for events lasting
>30 mins [37, 62]. Carbohydrate doses during activity can
be scaled based on the event, where more/less carbohy-
drate is consumed with respect to the time and intensity
of sport/exercise performance [37, 62]. In most cases,
carbohydrate supplements appear to be vegan-friendly,
and so their consumption is feasible for most vegan ath-
letes. Consuming calcium-fortified fruit juices as a liquid
carbohydrate might serve dual purposes however, and en-
able vegans to meet both carbohydrate and calcium needs
whilst concomitantly offering possible ergogenic advan-
tages if used as indicated in the literature [61].
Fat
Vegan diets are typically lower in total and saturated fat
and higher in n-6 fats than omnivorous and vegetarian
diets [8, 13, 63]. This trend appears to be associated with
reductions in heart disease, hypertension, type II dia-
betes, cholesterol and cancer [63], and is a purported
health benefit of veganism. However, the role of fat in
the diet is an area of much discussion, and deleterious
effects of fat consumption are not universally accepted
[64–66]. Indeed, in some cases, high-fat diets have even
been promoted [55]. Interestingly, research has indicated
that low-fat dieting might negatively influence testoster-
one levels in males [67]. This might be of interest to ath-
letes needing to maximise anabolism and adaptation to
resistance training. However, despite reporting lower
total and saturated fat intakes, evidence has also suggested
that vegan males do not have statistically lower androgen
levels than omnivores [68]. Relationships between fat con-
sumption, hormones and sport performance might require
additional investigation. In many instances, it appears
that the health implications of a dietary fat might re-
flect its fatty acid composition [64, 69], meaning that
attention should be paid to the quantity and quality
of fat consumed. Achieving recommended values of
0.5–1.5 g ∙ kg ∙ day−1 (or 30% of daily caloric intake) is
feasible for vegan athletes given adequate consumption of
oils, avocados, nuts and seeds.
ALA, EPA and DHA
Due to an absence of marine-sourced fats, vegans appear
to consume fewer n-3 fatty acids and possess lower
serum n-3 fatty acid levels than omnivores and other
vegetarians [8, 13, 63, 70]. This might have important
health and performance implications. The n-3 fatty acids
are important for normal growth and development, and
appear to play an important role in cardiovascular health
[71], in inflammatory and chronic disease [72], and might
improve exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) and
immunity [73]. Of interest to athletes, n-3 fats might also
increase nitric oxide production [71, 74], and improve
heart-rate variability [75]. Both n-6 and n-3 fatty acids are
parent fatty acids for eicosanoids (prostaglandins, throm-
boxanes and leukotrienes), and n-3 fatty acids appear to
possess anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiarrhyth-
mic;
hypolipidemic,
vasodilatory
and
antiproliferative
properties [71, 72]. Both n-6 and n-3 fatty acids are essen-
tial, however the long chain n-3 fatty acids eicosapenta-
enoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are
considered to be under-consumed in the modern western
diet in general [72], and in vegans in particular [47, 70].
There is ongoing debate about the quantity and/or
ratio of n-3 to n-6 needed to manipulate the synthesis
of pro and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids in order to
impact health and performance favourably [76–78]. In
the UK, an upper limit of 10% of energy from pro-
inflammatory n-6 fatty acids has been recommended
by the Department of Health to reduce negative effects
of overconsumption [78]. Elsewhere, Sanders [79] and
Philips [14] recommend that vegetarian diets limit
linoleic acid consumption (an n-6 fatty acid), found in
sunflower, corn and safflower oils, for similar purposes.
The n-3 α-linolenic acid (ALA) is an important con-
stituent of cellular membrane and is converted to EPA
at ~8% efficiency in humans, which appears to be both
age and gender-specific in magnitude [80]. Roughly
0.5% of ALA is converted to DHA, highlighting humans’
poor ability to enzymatically convert ALA to this fatty acid
[81]. While humans do convert a small amount of ALA to
DHA, the primary source of this in the diet is cold water
fish and seafood. EPA and DHA exert many of the re-
ported health and performance benefits of n-3 fatty acid
consumption and is now a popular supplement [80]. Sup-
plemental ALA has been shown to increase blood EPA
levels [82] but does not appear to affect DHA status [83].
Microalgae oil is rich in DHA (and EPA) and might be
a
useful
supplement
for
vegans
and
vegetarians.
Microalgae-oil supplements have been shown to raise
both blood EPA and DHA levels [84]. However, recom-
mendations for vegan-friendly DHA supplements do
not appear in the literature at this time [9]. Recommenda-
tions do appear for other food sources of the n-3 ALA,
such as flax seeds, walnuts, and chia seeds [9, 14]. Inter-
estingly, flax/linseeds are also rich in lignan precursors,
which might offer broader health-related benefits [85], and
chia is also a complete protein [86]. Combining whole-food
sources of ALA as indicated in this article with supplemen-
tal DHA derived from microalgae oil might optimise a
vegan’s n-3 fatty acid intake, and improve health concur-
rently with any health and performance-enhancing effect
Rogerson Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2017) 14:36

 that augmented n-3 diets might offer athletes [76, 77].
Research detailing how to optimise n-3 consumption for
vegans is missing at the time of writing; however, recom-
mendations of 1–2 g ∙ day−1 of combined EPA and DHA
at a ratio of 2:1 have been suggested for athletes elsewhere
[77]. To achieve a DHA dose of 500 - 1000 mg ∙ day−1, this
would equate to 1–2 g of microalgae oil, or 2–4 capsules
in most commercial products.
Micronutrients
Achieving micronutrient sufficiency is an important con-
cern for all athletes. The AND have indicated that atten-
tion should be paid to achieving adequacy in vitamin
B12, iron, zinc, calcium, iodine and vitamin D intakes
when designing a vegan diet in particular [47]. Poorly
designed diets might predispose individuals to deficiency
regardless of predilection, which could have detrimental
health and performance implications [2, 9, 12]. This needs
to be understood by those seeking to adopt veganism, and
strategies to mitigate the risks of under-consuming these
nutrients need to be present if a vegan diet is to
optimize health and performance. Table 3 compares the
nutritional implications of several diets (omnivorous,
pesco-vegetarian, vegetarian and vegan), and provides
recommendations for athletes and practitioners. The
following section will identify and elaborate upon con-
cerns highlighted in the literature, based upon research
indicating what micronutrients might be under-consumed
in a vegan diet [2–4, 8, 14, 47, 63, 70, 87].
Vitamin B12
Due to an absence of animal and dairy products, vegans
are at an increased risk of developing Vitamin B12
(cobalamin) deficiency [87]. Cobalamin is synthesised
from anaerobic microorganisms, in the rumen of cattle
and sheep, and humans typically consume pre-formed
cobalamin from animal products, which are the main
source of B12 in the diet [88]. Plant-based sources of
cobalamin are unusual, unless the plant has been con-
taminated by manure or from animal waste [47, 88].
Cobalamin is essential for normal nervous system func-
tion, homocysteine metabolism and DNA synthesis [88].
Insufficient cobalamin can lead to morphological changes
to the blood cells and the development of haematological
and neurological symptoms, such as megaloblastic an-
aemia and neuropathy [89]. Long-term cobalamin defi-
ciency can lead to irreversible neurological damage, and
data indicates that veganism can lead to deficiency if
cobalamin is not supplemented [14]. Data from the
EPIC-Oxford cohort study in the UK indicated that
~50% of vegan participants were vitamin B12 deficient
[90]. An additional 21% of the vegans were also classi-
fied as having very low levels. Interestingly, despite 20%
of participants consuming a B12 supplement, blood-
vitamin levels between those that did vs. those that did
not take supplements were no different, suggesting that
the supplementation practices of the cohort were inad-
equate to achieve B12 sufficiency. Sources of vitamin
B12 suitable for a vegan diet include B12-fortified break-
fast cereals and nutritional yeast, as well as dietary supple-
ments. Supplemental vitamin B12 products typically
contain cyanocobalamin, although other forms such as
methylcobalamin and hydroxocobalamin are available—
the latter by prescription only. The body appears to have a
limited capacity to absorb vitamin B12 supplements orally
[88, 89], which is limited by the presence of intrinsic fac-
tor, a glycoprotein secreted by the stomach’s parietal cells
that combines with B12 prior to absorption in the distal
ileum via receptor-mediated endocytosis [89]. For an
ingested 500 μg oral supplement, only an approximated
10 μg might be absorbed [89]. Because of this poor bio-
availability, sublingual drops, lozenges and transdermal
products have been developed and marketed under the
pretence that they offer better absorption, however re-
search supporting these claims could not be found when
writing this article. The requirement for vegans to supple-
ment with vitamin B12 is important, and vegans are ad-
vised to consume fortified foods and/or take a daily
supplement to ensure an adequate intake of the vitamin
[9, 14]. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for vitamin
B12 is 2.4 μg ∙ day−1 for adults of both sexes [91], and
vegans have been advised to consume up to 6 μg ∙ day− 1
of supplemental B12 by some authors [10]. Where ad-
equate B12 status cannot be achieved via oral supplemen-
tation and fortified food products alone, vegans might
need to have serum levels monitored by a medical practi-
tioner if deficiency is suspected [87]; subcutaneous or
intramuscular injections might even be indicated in some
contexts [87]; monitoring B12 status carefully might be
necessary for some vegan athletes.
Iron
The iron status of vegetarians and vegans has received
attention in the literature [92–94], and it appears that
owing to a diet rich in whole-grains and legumes, both
vegetarians and vegans consume similar amounts of iron
as omnivores [9, 63]. However, issues with the bioavail-
ability of plant-based iron might mean that vegans need
to pay attention to ensuring that sufficiency is prioritized
[92, 93]. The main source of iron in the vegan diet is
found in the non-haem form, which is less bioavailable
than the haem iron found in animal products [93].
Vegan diets also commonly contain dietary inhibitors
such as the polyphenols tannin (found in coffee, tea, and
cocoa) and phytates (found in whole grains and legumes),
which reduce the amount of iron absorbed from the diet.
Research into the iron status of vegans has found that
female vegans appear to have lower iron stores than

 omnivores, and are more prone to iron-deficiency an-
aemia [63, 94, 95]. Male vegans appear to have a similar
iron status as non-vegans and are less impacted by iron
status [63]. Iron-deficiency anaemia is caused by insuf-
ficient consumption of iron (or insufficient absorption
of iron) and is a decrease in red blood cells (RBCs) or
haemoglobin, leading to symptoms such as tiredness
and fatigue; weakness, shortness of breath and reduced
exercise tolerance [95]. Iron deficiency without anaemia
has also been shown to reduce endurance capacity, in-
crease energy expenditure and impair adaptation to en-
durance exercise in females experiencing tissue depletion
[96]. Supplementation has been shown to correct such
problems and might be warranted if adequacy cannot be
achieved via the diet (97). Indeed, achieving an iron-
sufficient diet appears to be rudimentary for all female
athletes [95–97].
Interestingly, however, it has been suggested that the
body can regulate iron absorption based upon blood
concentrations of the mineral [14]. Low iron status can
lead to intestinal adaptations that increase absorption
and reduce secretion in order to maintain equilibrium
[14]—an effect that appears to be present with other im-
portant micronutrients discussed in this article [3, 97]. It
appears that humans can adapt to a wide range of iron
statuses and intakes, and vegetarians and vegans generally
do not appear to suffer adverse health effects because of
reduced iron absorption [98]. Hunt [93], however, recom-
mends that iron intakes for vegetarians be increased by
80%, so that adult males and females achieve a recom-
mended intake of 14 mg ∙ day−1 and 33 mg ∙ day−1 (vs.
the Recommended Daily Allowance’s 8 mg ∙ day−1 and
18 mg ∙ day−1), due to the aforementioned bioavailabil-
ity issues. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) concur, and
suggest that iron requirements for vegetarians are 1.8
times greater than omnivores [92]. Elevated intakes of
iron for vegetarians and vegans have been refuted how-
ever on the basis that high iron intakes might increase
susceptibility to heart disease and cancer [99], and that
supplemental iron might affect the bioavailability of
other minerals and copper [14]. Indeed, it has also been
suggested that such recommendations have exaggerated
requirements by basing recommendations off of acute
feeding studies, where the effects of iron inhibitors and
enhancers might have been artificially pronounced [3,
92, 100]. Non-haem iron absorption can be enhanced
(as well as inhibited), and consuming non-haem iron-
rich foods in conjunction with vitamin C appears to in-
crease absorption [9, 92]. Vegan athletes should there-
fore look to achieve iron sufficiency by choosing
wholefood iron sources, reducing their consumption of
inhibitor-containing foodstuffs such as tea, coffee and
cocoa (when eating iron-rich meals), consume vitamin
C containing foods concurrently to enhance absorption,
and incorporate soaked, sprouted and/or fermented
foods in their diets, if palatable. In cases of where indi-
viduals might be prone to iron deficiency, i.e. females
with large menstrual blood losses, monitoring iron sta-
tus and considering supplementation might be neces-
sary. A list of food sources for iron and other nutrients
discussed in this article can be found in Table 4.
Zinc
Zinc is a constituent of enzymes involved in metabolic
processes that relate to DNA stabilisation and gene ex-
pression, and is important in cell growth, repair and
protein metabolism [92]. Similar to iron, zinc is widely
available in plant-based foods but is also not readily
absorbed [93]. Similarly as well, the body appears to
adapt to lower intakes of zinc by reducing losses and
increasing absorption in order to maintain equilibrium
[3, 97]. It has been suggested therefore that vegetarians
do not need to pay special attention to consuming this
mineral [3]. However, the IOM have suggested that veg-
etarians might need to consume up to 50% more zinc
than non-vegetarians owing to its poor bioavailability
[92]. Indeed, common vegan sources of zinc include
beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds (Table 4)—foods
that also contain phytate [93]. However, processing foods
can reduce phytate too. Leavening bread activates phytase,
breaking down phytic acid, and soaking, fermenting and
sprouting nuts and grains can all reduce phytate levels
and increase nutrient bioavailability [101]. Based on the
IOM’s suggestion, it has been recommended that male
vegans consume up to 16.5 mg ∙ day−1 of zinc (vs. the
RDA of 11 mg ∙ day−1) and females up to 12 mg ∙ day−1
(vs. 8 mg ∙ day−1) [10]. Zinc bioavailability appears to be

 enhanced by dietary protein and inhibited by supplemen-
tal folic acid, iron, calcium, copper and magnesium, but
might not be affected by the whole-food sources of these
nutrients [101]. In order to achieve the above recommen-
dations, vegans should look to consume zinc-rich foods
such as hemp and pumpkin seeds, and other grains,
nuts and beans (Table 4), and look to adopt processing
methods that improve mineral absorption, such as
soaking and fermenting, as suggested earlier. If this is
not achievable, a supplement should be considered. Owing
to issues concerning bioavailability, zinc supplements
should not be consumed at the same time as supplemental
forms of the aforementioned minerals. Multivitamin/
mineral formulas might be inadequate if to ensure nu-
trient adequacy in this instance.
Calcium
Calcium is abundant in a wide range of foodstuffs, most
notably dairy products. Data indicates that vegans con-
sume less calcium than omnivores and other vegetarians
[63]. Indeed, Canadian vegans have been shown to consume
only 578 mg ∙ day−1 compared with the 950 mg ∙ day−1 and
875 mg ∙ day−1 of omnivores and ovo-lacto vegetarians
[102]. Vegans have been shown to be at a higher risk of
fracture due to lower calcium intakes [103]. Low in-
takes of calcium are particularly problematic for chil-
dren and teenagers, where higher calcium requirements
are required for bone development [78, 104]. As with
other minerals, the body appears to be able to regulate
calcium status during periods of low consumption.
When habitual calcium intakes are low, and when suffi-
cient vitamin D is present, an increased proportion of
calcium is absorbed from food [104]. It has been sug-
gested that lower protein intakes typical of a vegan diet
might contribute to greater calcium retention due to
high-protein diets promoting calcium excretion in the
urine [104, 105]. However, evidence demonstrates that
protein-rich diets have no effect on calcium retention
[105], and in some instances work synergistically with
calcium to improve calcium retention and bone metab-
olism [34, 105]. It is widely recommended that ad-
equate calcium is necessary for blood clotting, nerve
transmission, muscle stimulation, vitamin D metabolism
and maintaining bone structure [106]. Indeed, the import-
ance of calcium for the vegan athlete reflects its role in
the maintenance of skeletal health during weight-bearing
exercise, and increased calcium losses experienced during
heavy perspiration [107]. Calcium requirements might
also be exacerbated during phases of calorie restriction,
amenorrhea and in some instances of the female athlete
triad [107]. However, it is also proposed that the RDA for
calcium (1000 mg ∙ day−1) is sufficient to meet the require-
ments of athletic populations in most contexts, and so
despite the aforesaid factors, it has been suggested that
athletes do not have an elevated requirement for the nutri-
ent in general [107].
In order to meet the above requirement, vegan athletes
should consume plant-based sources of calcium such as
beans, pulses and green vegetables in sufficient quan-
tities to achieve the 1000 mg ∙ day−1 recommendation
[106]. Broccoli, bok choy and kale are particularly high
in calcium; green vegetables such as spinach and arugula
contain oxalate however, which impedes calcium absorp-
tion [104]. Vegans therefore should choose plant sources
that contain low oxalate levels when designing calcium-
rich meals. Calcium-fortified foods are also widely avail-
able, and examples such as calcium-fortified soy, nut
milks and fruit juices are all vegan-friendly and provide
readily absorbable forms of the nutrient (Table 4).
Vegans can also consume calcium-set tofu, which is also
rich in protein, to help achieve their requirements if pal-
atable. If a vegan diet cannot achieve sufficient calcium
levels, then a supplement might also be required [14].
Iodine
Iodine is an essential trace element needed for physical
and mental growth and development, and plays in an
important role in thyroid function and metabolism [92].
Excessively high or low intakes of iodine can lead to
thyroid dysfunction, and vegans have been shown to
consume both excessively high and low intakes depend-
ing on their dietary choices [108, 109]. To highlight, a
study by Krajcovicova-Kudlackova and colleagues [110]
found that 80% of Slovakian vegans were iodine defi-
cient. Lightowler and Davies [109] however found that
some vegans consumed excess iodine (from seaweed) in
their study. Common iodine sources include fish and
dairy products, and the DRI for Iodine has been set at
150 μg ∙ day−1 for adults [92]. Iodine content in foods
vary according to the soil-iodine content (when growing
produce), the farming methods used during production,
the season it is grown in, and the species of fish (if non
vegan) [111]. Goitrogens, found in cruciferous vegetables
such as cabbage, cauliflower and rutabaga decrease iodine
utilisation and might affect adversely thyroid function if
consumed in large amounts [111]. However, cooking such
foods appears to destroy many of the goitrogenic com-
pounds present, making this effect unlikely. Raw-food
vegans should look to limit the consumption of raw, goi-
trogenic foods where possible.
Seaweed and sea vegetables are a concentrated source
of iodine that are vegan-friendly. Excessively high iodine
intakes have been reported in vegans who regularly con-
sume seaweed however [109, 112], and in some cases have
led to elevated Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels
[113, 114]. Elevated TSH might reflect iodine-induced
hyperthyroidism or iodine-induced hypothyroidism [114].
However, iodine intakes above 150 μg ∙ day−1 appear to be
Rogerson Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition  (2017) 14:36 
Page 9 of 15
 well tolerated, unless clinical susceptibilities to thyroid is-
sues are present [115]. Iodine concentrations in seaweed
can vary markedly [115], and the British Dietetic Associ-
ation suggests that seaweed might not be a reliable iodine
source [116]. Iodized table salt has however been indicated
for vegans looking to achieve sufficient intakes [14], and
iodine can be also found in foods such as potatoes, breads
(in some countries) and cranberries (Table 4). Examples of
how to achieve sufficient iodine levels (and for other nutri-
ents discussed in this article) can be seen in Tables 5 and 6,
which provide menus based on a 2500 and 3500 Calorie
requirement. Where iodine sufficiency cannot be achieved
through food alone, a supplement that meets the 150 μg ∙
day−1 recommendation might be advisable.
Vitamin D
Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin produced in the skin,
is essential for calcium absorption and bone health, and
plays an important role in many physiological processes
[117]. While humans synthesize vitamin D from expos-
ure to sunlight, vitamin D can also be found in animal
products and fortified foods [117]. Dietary intakes of
vitamin D appear to be low in vegans who do not achieve
sufficient sun exposure [118]. Cholecalciferol (D3) is an
animal-derived version of vitamin D that is now widely
available as a supplement [119]. Ergocalciferol [D2] is a
vegan-friendly version of vitamin D but appears to be less
bioavailable than cholecalciferol [119, 120]. Recently, how-
ever, vegan-friendly versions of cholecalciferol derived
from lichen, a composite fungal-algae organism, have be-
come commercially available, offering vegans a more bio-
available supplemental option. These supplements appear
to be dosed similarly to animal-derived products, with
dosages of 200–1000 IU per serving being common, and
can be used as a like-for-like equivalent for animal-based
counterparts.
In the USA, the IOM recommend an RDA of 600
I.U ∙ day−1 [117] for vitamin D. In the UK the Depart-
ment of Health recommend 10 μg ∙ day−1 (400 I.U) is
supplemented by individuals who do not achieve ad-
equate sun exposure [121]. Of interest to athletes,
Cannell et al. [122] suggest that optimising vitamin D
status might improve athletic performance, if deficiency is
present. Indeed, Moran et al. [123] highlight that poor
vitamin D status negatively affects muscle strength and
oxygen consumption, and suggest that supplementation
might protect against overuse injury via its role in calcium
metabolism and skeletal muscle function. Optimising vita-
min D status is perhaps an important consideration for all
athletes, regardless of dietary choice [124].
Effective vitamin D dosing might necessitate that sup-
plementation is optimized via bespoke treatment strat-
egies [125], based on individuals’ existing blood levels. In
order to determine vitamin D status, plasma 25OHD
levels can be sampled. Values <20 ng ∙ ml−1 are considered
to be clinically deficient [126]. Optimal values might fall
between 40 and 70 ng ∙ ml−1 [126, 127]. Recommenda-
tions for supplementation provided by Dalqhuist and

 colleagues [128] suggest that athletes should aim to achieve
plasma 25OHD levels in the range of 30–40 ng ∙ ml−1.
Dalqhuist and team [128] also suggest that supplemen-
tal doses of up to 4–5000 IU ∙ day−1 coupled with 50–
100 μg ∙ day−1 of vitamin K1 and K2 could improve
exercise

allowing
athletes

frequently. Data concerning performance-enhancing ef-
fects and toxicity at higher dosages of vitamin D have
yet to be demonstrated, however a tolerable upper in-
take of 4000 IU ∙ day−1 has been established by the
IOM [106]. Blood 25OHD values >150 ng ∙ ml−1 (plus
hypercalcemia) are generally thought to signify toxicity
[126]. Further research is warranted to determine opti-
mal vitamin D doses for athletes.
Supplements and ergogenic aids
Creatine
Research indicates that vegetarian and vegan diets reduce
muscle creatine stores [129–131]. Creatine is a nitroge-
neous, organic acid synthesized endogenously from argin-
ine, glycine and methionine [132]. Foods such as meat, fish
and poultry are rich sources of creatine but are excluded
from a vegan diet. Creatine’s performance-enhancing ef-
fects have been well studied, and it appears that supple-
mentation can improve short-term high-intensity exercise
performance, muscle hypertrophy and maximal strength
[132, 133]. Creatine supplementation might also lead to
increased plasma volume, improved glycogen storage,
improved ventilatory threshold, and reduce oxygen
consumption during submaximal exercise [133]. Inter-
estingly, data indicates that creatine supplementation
might be most beneficial for athletes with low pre-existing
muscle creatine stores. To highlight, Burke et al. [129]
found that supplemental creatine attenuated low muscle
creatine stores in vegetarians, who experienced greater
improvements in FFM, maximal strength and type II
muscle fibre area compared to omnivores. Creatine sup-
plementation might therefore be an important ergogenic
aid for vegan athletes to consider, and compensate for re-
duced muscle creatine stores experienced as a result of
their lifestyle choices.
Dosing creatine effectively requires the achievement of
muscle creatine saturation, and regimens of 20 g ∙ day−1
for 3–7 days to load creatine followed by maintenance
doses of 3–5 g ∙ day−1 are common [132]. However, a
smaller dose of 3–5 g ∙ day−1 taken over a 4-week period
will achieve creatine saturation over the long term simi-
larly [134]. Other protocols, such as 1 g ∙ 30 min−1 over
20 intakes per day, have also been suggested as means to
achieve maximal saturation [135]. The co-ingestion of
creatine with protein and carbohydrate might increase
creatine retention by way of insulin-mediated storage,
but appears not to have any noticeable performance-
enhancing effects beyond stand-alone ingestion [133].
For vegan athletes who decide to supplement, powder
forms of synthetic creatine are vegan-friendly (capsu-
lated products might contain bovine gelatine), and the
co-ingestion of creatine with whole food and/or a pro-
tein and carbohydrate mixture might be an optimal way
of achieving creatine storage.

 Beta alanine
Similar to muscle creatine levels, evidence also indicates
that vegetarians have lower levels of muscle carnosine
compared to omnivores [136, 137]. Carnosine, an intra-
cellular proton buffer and antioxidant, is a cytoplasmic
dipeptide (β-alanyl-l-histidine) found in skeletal muscle
and the central nervous system, and is synthesised in
situ from its rate-limiting precursor β-alanine [136].
Meat and poultry are the main sources of β-alanine in
the diet, and β-alanine supplementation has been shown
to increase muscle carnosine concentrations, leading to
improvements in high-intensity exercise performance by
way of buffering excess protons, scavenging free radicals,
chelating transition metals and reducing fatigue [138, 139].
Achieving muscle carnosine saturation appears to be an
important factor in effective β-alanine dosing, and research
validates the efficacy of loading β-alanine in divided doses
of 4–6 g ∙ day−1 for 2–4 weeks [139]. The efficacy of
β-alanine supplementation has been confirmed in ex-
ercise >60 s duration, in aerobic exercise, and in at-
tenuating muscle fatigue and improving time-trial
performance in high-intensity exercise [139]. The ef-
fect of supplementation in exercise lasting <60 s is un-
clear however. Owing to muscle carnosine levels being
lower in vegetarians than omnivores [137], it is feasible
that the efficacy of β-alanine supplementation might also
be augmented in vegans. Further research is necessary to
validate this hypothesis however.
Taurine and β-alanine share transport mechanisms,
meaning that supplemental β-alanine might theoretically
inhibit taurine uptake in skeletal muscle [139, 140]. Tau-
rine is a sulphur-containing amino acid that appears to
play a role in many important physiological processes in
humans, including bile acid conjugation, cardiovascular
function, neurotransmission and euglycemia, and is ob-
tained from seafood, meat and dairy products [140, 141].
Vegans have been shown to consume negligible amounts
of taurine [142], which is conditionally essential in some
clinical contexts [141]. It has been suggested that vegans
might benefit from taurine supplements owing to its ab-
sence in the vegan diet [10]. However, further support
for this recommendation could not be found in the lit-
erature located for this article. If indeed supplemental
β-alanine does lead to reductions in taurine in humans,
then vegans might be at greater risk of experiencing
taurine depletion due to its absence from the diet.
However, it must be noted that β-alanine has not been
shown to reduce taurine levels in humans to date, and
is considered to be safe when used within the parame-
ters of recommended dosing [139].
The primary limitation of this review is the lack of re-
search into veganism in sport. To mitigate this issue, in-
formation was gathered for this review from multiple
sources, and inferences were made from the available
data and via reasoned judgements. As such, many of the
recommendations in this article require authentication,
and so this article should serve as a catalyst for future
research as well as a guidance document for athletes and
practitioners. The main strength of this review is its
comprehensiveness.
Conclusions
In general, vegan diets tend to be lower in Calories, protein,
fat, vitamin B12, n-3 fats, calcium and iodine than om-
nivorous diets, whilst concurrently being higher in car-
bohydrates, fibre, micronutrients, phytochemicals and
antioxidants. Achieving a high energy intake is difficult
in some instances, owing to plant-based foods promot-
ing satiety. Issues with the digestibility and absorption
of nutrients such as protein, calcium, iron and zinc might
be an issue too, meaning that athletes might need to
consume higher amounts of these foods compared to
omnivores and other vegetarians. However, through the
strategic selection and management of food choices,
and with special attention being paid to the achievement
of energy, macro and micronutrient recommendations,
along with appropriate supplementation, a vegan diet can
achieve the needs of most athletes satisfactorily. Sup-
plementation with creatine and β-alanine might offer
augmented performance-enhancing effects in vegans,
who experience low pre-existing levels of these substances,
and further research is needed to investigate the
performance-enhancing effects of these substances in
vegan populations. For some, a vegan diet is the mani-
festation of important ethical beliefs, and requires dili-
gence to sustain [5–7]. It is a central tenet of this
article that similar conscientiousness needs be paid to
achieving dietary sufficiency, otherwise health and per-
formance could suffer over the long term if an individual’s
nutrition is not managed appropriately.
