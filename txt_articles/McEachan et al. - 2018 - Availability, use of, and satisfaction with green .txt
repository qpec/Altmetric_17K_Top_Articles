Summary 
Background It is unknown whether the quantity or quality of green space is more important for mental wellbeing. We 
aimed to explore associations between availability of, satisfaction with, and use of green space and mental wellbeing 
among children aged 4 years in a multi-ethnic sample.
Methods We did a 4-year follow-up assessment of participants in the Born in Bradford longitudinal cohort study, which 
recruited children and mothers at the city’s main maternity unit from 2007 to 2011. The primary outcome was parent-
reported mental wellbeing for children aged 4 years, assessed with the standardised Strengths and Difficulties 
Questionnaire. Total, internalising, and externalising behavioural difficulties and prosocial behaviour scales were 
computed (with higher scores indicating greater difficulties or more prosocial behaviour). Residential green space 
around participants’ home addresses and distance to major green spaces were computed with the normalised difference 
vegetation index (NDVI). A subsample of participants completed additional questionnaires on measures of satisfaction 
with, and use of, local green spaces. Multiple regressions examined associations between green space and children’s 
mental wellbeing and explored moderation by ethnicity (white British vs south Asian) and socioeconomic status.
Findings Between Oct 1, 2012, and June 30, 2015, 2594 mothers attended a follow-up appointment during which they 
completed a detailed questionnaire assessing the health of their child. 1519 (58%) participants were of south Asian 
origin, 740 (29%) of white British origin, and 333 (13%) of another ethnicity. Data on ethnicity were missing for two 
participants. 832 (32%) of 2594 participants completed additional questionnaires. Ethnicity moderated associations 
between residential green space and mental wellbeing (p<0·05 for total and internalising difficulties). After adjusting 
for all relevant variables, more green space was associated with fewer internalising behavioural difficulties (mean 
NDVI 100 m: β –2·35 [95% CI –4·20 to –0·50]; 300 m: –3·15 [–5·18 to –1·13]; 500 m: –2·85 [–4·91 to –0·80]) and with 
fewer total behavioural difficulties (100 m: –4·27 [–7·65 to –0·90]; 300 m: –5·22 [–8·91 to –1·54]; 500 m: 
–4·82 [–8·57 to –1·07]) only for south Asian children across all three buffer zones. In the subsample of participants, 
the effect of NDVI on wellbeing was rendered non-significant after controlling for satisfaction with, and use of, green 
space. Among south Asian children, satisfaction with green space was significantly associated with fewer total 
behavioural difficulties across all three buffer zones (β –0·59 [95% CI –1·11 to –0·07]), fewer internalising behavioural 
difficulties within 100 m (–0·28 [95% CI –0·56 to –0·003]) and 300 m buffer zones (–0·28 [–0·56 to –0·002]), and 
greater prosocial behaviour across all three buffer zones (0·20 [0·02 to 0·38]); no such associations were observed 
among white British children. 
Interpretation Positive effects of green space on wellbeing differ by ethnicity. Satisfaction with the quality of green 
space appears to be a more important predictor of wellbeing than does quantity of green space. Public health 
professionals and urban planners need to focus on both quality and quantity of urban green spaces to promote health, 
particularly among ethnic minority groups.

Introduction
Mental ill health is a major source of disease,1 with 
costs estimated to be US$2·5 trillion globally.2 Natural 
environments are important determinants of physical 
and mental health3–5 and, with more than 50% of the 
global population and 73% of Europe’s population6 living 
in urban areas, urban green spaces have an important 
role in improving quality of life for urban dwellers. 
Despite a large body of evidence linking urban green 
spaces to mental health among adults, a systematic 
review has highlighted the paucity of evidence exploring 
associations 
between 
natural 
environments 
and

children’s mental health.4 As mental ill health in 
childhood is an important predictor of mental health in 
adulthood,7 ascertaining the potential of urban green 
spaces in promoting mental wellbeing among children is 
important.
Studies have reported mixed effects of urban green 
spaces on children’s mental wellbeing,8–15 as assessed by 
the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).16 A 
limitation of these studies is that, with the exception of 
one,10 none was able to control for the effect of maternal 
mental wellbeing on children’s outcomes, a factor that 
has been shown to predict later distress among children.17 
Differences in measurement of green space exposure are 
also likely to have contributed to the mixed research 
findings. Many studies use area-based measures of green 
space, such as a percentage of green space within a 
predefined geographical unit10 or the normalised 
difference vegetation index (NDVI), which estimates 
density of green vegetation within a predefined area.11 
However, these measures do not assess the actual or 
perceived quality of local green space and how it is used 
by local communities. Quality can be measured 
objectively through use of standardised audit tools18 or by 
asking participants to rate attributes of environments 
according to a range of criteria.19 The quality of green 
space has been shown to independently predict mental 
wellbeing in adults, in addition to indicators of quantity.5,19 
One study explored associations between objectively 
assessed quality, satisfaction with, and use of local green 
space in a multi-ethnic deprived community (Roberts H, 
Department of Psychology, University of Leeds [Leeds, 
UK] and Bradford Institute for Health Research, Bradford 
Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust [Bradford, 
UK], personal com 
munication). Poorer quality green 
spaces assessed via park audits influenced perceived 
satisfaction with green spaces, suggesting that satisfaction 
can be a useful proxy for objective assessments of quality. 
Furthermore, 
quality 
of 
green 
spaces 
predicted 
subsequent use of these spaces. To fully investigate the 
differences in the associations between green space and 
health outcomes for different groups, it is important to 
have information about how these spaces are perceived 
and used. However, with some notable exceptions,9,10 
there is a paucity of literature in this area, and studies 
exploring the relative contribution of the availability of, 
satisfaction with, and use of green space on mental 
wellbeing among children are warranted.
An important debate in the literature involves 
identifying subgroups for whom interventions to 
promote green space availability and use might be most 
effective. Interventions such as increasing access to 
nature might function as a tool to reduce health 
inequalities by disproportionately benefiting those in 
greatest need.20 Beneficial effects also appear to vary by 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched the Web of Science, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO 
databases up to Dec 12, 2017, using the following search terms: 
(“Green space”) and (“child” or “preschool”, both MeSH 
headings) and (“mental health” MeSH term or “strengths and 
difficulties” or “SDQ”). We also searched reference lists of 
previous systematic reviews on this subject. We included 
quantitative studies that calculated an objective measure of 
green space availability by use of geographical information 
systems data (for example, percentage of green space within a 
predefined buffer or satellite-derived estimates of green space 
density), samples of children aged younger than 16 years, and 
used the standardised Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire 
(SDQ) as the primary outcome measure. We found eight studies 
examining associations between aspects of green space and 
wellbeing assessed by use of the SDQ, with inconsistent findings. 
None of these studies compared the relative contributions of 
quantity, quality, and use in associations between green space 
and wellbeing. Few studies explored whether associations were 
moderated by socioeconomic status and none explored 
variations by ethnicity. Limitations of the available literature 
included the inability to control for parental wellbeing.
Added value of this study
This study is, to our knowledge, the first to explore relative 
associations of quantity, quality, and use of green space with 
mental wellbeing in a multi-ethnic sample of children aged 
4 years in a deprived urban area. We found that more green 
space was associated with fewer total and internalising 
behavioural difficulties in children of south Asian origin living in 
a deprived urban area in the UK, but found no such association 
for white British children. We also found that, compared with 
white British children, south Asian children spent less time 
playing outside in green spaces, and that their parents were less 
satisfied with their green spaces. We found that satisfaction 
with the quality of local green spaces was a more important 
predictor of wellbeing than either quantity or use of green 
space among south Asian parents. Unlike some previous 
studies, we found no evidence of moderation by socioeconomic 
status.
Implications of all the available evidence
Local green spaces can promote positive wellbeing in children. 
However, the quantity of green space is not in itself sufficient to 
promote health. Ethnic minority groups typically have reduced 
access to high quality green spaces compared with the general 
population, which heightens health inequalities. Urban 
planners and public health professionals should work together 
to increase the availability and quality of green spaces for 
marginalised communities through a combination of structural 
and community-based interventions.

ethnicity, although results are mixed21,22 and no studies 
have explored variations in the context of children’s 
mental wellbeing. Reasons for ethnic differences are 
unclear, but minority groups might use green spaces less 
frequently than the general population because of 
dissatisfaction and perceived safety concerns.23 These 
findings highlight the importance of including, in 
addition to measures of availability, measures of 
satisfaction with, and use of, green space in studies 
aiming to identify associations between green space and 
health.
We aimed to explore the associations between 
availability of, satisfaction with, and use of urban green 
space (subsequently referred to as green space) and 
mental wellbeing among children aged 4 years. We also 
aimed to explore whether or not ethnicity or 
socioeconomic status moderated any effects of green 
space.
Methods
Study design and participants
This study was nested within a follow-up subsample of 
the Born in Bradford cohort, a longitudinal study of 
12 453 mothers recruited during pregnancy and 
13 776 children at the City’s main maternity unit between 
2007 and 2011. Full methods have been previously 
published.24 Bradford is the fifth largest metropolitan 
district in England, UK, and is characterised by high 
levels of ethnic diversity and deprivation.24 50% of the 
study cohort is of south Asian origin.
Participants provided written consent to long-term 
follow-up and to routine data linkage for health and 
education records. The present study reports data from 
respondents who participated in a follow-up assessment 
when their child was aged 4 years. The data reported 
came from information collected at baseline (during 
pregnancy), from bespoke questions asked during the 
4-year assessment, and from routine data linkage. Ethical 
approval was obtained from the Bradford NHS Research 
Ethics Committee (reference 07/H1302/112).
Mothers attended a follow-up appointment during 
which they completed a detailed questionnaire as 
sessing 
the health of their child. Appointments were offered in 
Mirpuri, 
Punjabi, 
or 
Urdu 
languages; 
69% 
of 
appointments were conducted in English and 31% in 
Mirpuri, Punjabi, or Urdu. A subsample of respondents 
completed an additional detailed question 
naire on green 
space use and satisfaction. Because of resource 
constraints, the additional questionnaire was offered 
only to English-speaking participants.
Measures 
The primary outcome was parent-reported mental 
wellbeing assessed with the standardised SDQ.16 The 
SDQ contains 25 items assessing four core dimensions 
of difficulties, two of which are externalising (conduct 
problems and hyperactivity) and two are internalising 
(emotional problems and peer problems). The question-
naire also assesses one area of strength: prosocial 
behaviour (range 0–5, with higher scores indicating more 
prosocial behaviour towards others). The four difficulty 
domains can be summed to create a total difficulties 
score (range 0–40, with higher scores indicating greater 
difficulties); they can also be combined into the two 
broader 
internalising 
and 
externalising 
subscales 
(range 0–20 for both, with higher scores indicating 
greater difficulties).
We calculated measures of residential green space for 
each participant using the NDVI. To explore residential 
greenness, we calculated the NDVI within three straight 
line buffers of 100 m, 300 m, and 500 m around 
participants’ geocoded home address. The NDVI ranges 
between –1 and 1, with higher values indicating more 
green vegetation. We used the Landsat 5 TM (USGS) 
remote sensing data at 30 m resolution to calculate NDVI 
values using the best available images between 2006 
and 2011; images were mostly taken on June 10, 2006 
(figure), with the exception of a small number of 
participants to the north of Bradford for whom a separate 
image was required and taken on Sept 28, 2011. We 
excluded major water bodies larger than 0·5 hectares 
(>5000 m²) because these values can skew the results 
of an otherwise green neighbourhood. Straight-line 
distances to major green spaces (>5000 m²) were 
calculated in metres.
A subsample of respondents was asked to rate 
satisfaction with, and use of, local green spaces. Green 
spaces were defined as public parks (including play areas 
specifically for children), sports playing fields, or other 
natural habitats (eg, woodland) comprising plants and 
other vegetation. To ascertain how often children used 
green spaces, we asked parents to report: how many days 
their child spent playing outside in green spaces per 
week in summer months and winter months, and how 
long on average their child spent playing outside in green 
spaces on these days (minutes per day). Responses were 
multiplied to create a weekly playing outside index for 
summer and winter. These indices were averaged to 
create an overall weekly playing outside index (minutes 
per week) as a proxy measure of time spent outside. 
Parents were then asked to report which green space they 
used most frequently in summer months and were asked 
how satisfied they were with its quality, with responses 
recorded on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging 
from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied), where 3 was 
a neutral response.
Ethnicity was self-reported at baseline with standard 
classifications.25 Because of large numbers of two main 
ethnic groups, we split ethnicity into three groups: 
south Asian, white British, and other. The last category 
represents a diverse group including Bangladeshi, 
black-African, and mixed race individuals. When 
comparing results of findings by ethnicity, we show 
results for south Asian and white British groups only.

We assessed individual and area-level indicators of 
socioeconomic status in line with previous literature on 
this subject.22 At an individual level we recorded mothers’ 
educational status as 1 (not reached high school diploma 
level, including those whose educational status was 
marked as unknown, a foreign qualification, or other), 
or 2 (high school diploma equivalent or higher). 
A measure of subjective poverty was included by use of 
the item “How well would you say you or you and your 
husband/partner are managing financially these days?”. 
Response options “just about getting by”, “quite difficult”, 
“very difficult”, and “does not wish to answer” were 
coded as 1 (struggling financially). Response options 
“living comfortably” and “doing alright” were coded 
as 2 (not struggling financially).
At an area level we included the Index of Multiple 
Deprivation (IMD)26 as a measure of relative deprivation 
at a national level. The IMD is constructed from 
seven domains of deprivation (income, employment, 
education, health, crime, barriers to housing and 
services, and living environment) at a lower super output 
area (LSOA) level. The postcode of each mother’s place of 
residence at registration was mapped to the LSOA and 
these were then matched to IMD 2015 scores. Given the 
high level of deprivation observed in the current sample 
(with 66% of the sample living in the most deprived 
quintile of deprivation relative to UK averages), we split 
IMD scores into local quintiles of deprivation 
(where 1 comprises the most deprived quintile within the 
sample and 5 comprises the least deprived).
Other variables were mother’s age, mother’s smoking 
behaviour, child’s age, and mother’s cohabitation status 
(married and living with partner, not married and living 
with partner, or not living with partner). Tertiles of 
household size were calculated for the total sample 
population and for each ethnic group (where tertile 1 
represents smallest house sizes and tertile 3 represents 
largest house sizes). We constructed a dichotomous 
variable indicating whether the mother had a record of 
treatment for any common mental disorder (eg, anxiety 
or depression) during the previous year from their routine 
primary health-care data using a validated algorithm.17
Statistical analysis
We explored associations between measures of green 
space and children’s total, externalising, and internalising 
SDQ scores, as well as the prosocial behaviour scale. 
Analyses were done in R, version 3.3.1.27 Analyses were 
done for the total sample and separately for white British 
and south Asian groups for comparison. Mean (SD) 
values were calculated for parametric variables and 
median (IQR) values for non-parametric variables. 
Cronbach’s alpha (a measure of internal scale reliability) 
was computed for the SDQ scales. Comparisons between 
the white British and south Asian groups were done with 
Welch’s t tests and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous 
variables and with χ² tests and Fisher’s exact tests for 
categorical variables. Ten high outlying responses for 
minutes spent playing outside per week were identified. 
We ran a sensitivity analysis removing these outlying 
responses and results were not altered. These participants 
were thus retained. p values were also calculated to test 
for differences in characteristics between the total sample 
size and subsamples of participants who completed the 
additional green space questionnaire. p values less than 
0·05 were considered significant.

Unadjusted regression models were computed, then 
covariates were entered sequentially in logical blocks 
after ethnicity was first adjusted for in the total sample 
population: demographic covariates (child’s age and sex, 
and mother’s age and cohabitation status), socioeconomic 
covariates (maternal education, subjective poverty, 
household size, and IMD [quintiles were created for the 
total sample population and within each ethnic group]), 
and health behaviours (maternal smoking and record of 
any common mental disorder). Results are reported as 
β coefficients, which represent the mean change in the 
predicted value of outcome Y for a one-unit increase in 
exposure X, while holding all other variables constant. 
Analyses were calculated for all three buffer zones 
(100 m, 300 m, and 500 m). IMD quintiles and satisfaction 
with outdoor green space were entered as continuous 
variables. In the subsample of participants, we included 
data on satisfaction with, and use of, local green space as 
predictors of wellbeing after controlling for all other 
confounding variables. These analyses therefore allowed 
comparison of quantity (NDVI), quality (satisfaction 
with), and use of green spaces in association with 
children’s wellbeing.
To explore effect moderation by ethnicity or 
socioeconomic status, we assessed inclusion of an 
interaction term between residential surrounding 
greenness and ethnicity, maternal education, or financial 
struggles by comparing fully adjusted models with and 
without the interaction term using likelihood ratio tests. 
Moderation by ethnicity was significant; therefore, we 
stratified the fully adjusted models by ethnic groups.

Results
Data were collected between Oct 1, 2012, and June 30, 2015. 
The final sample comprised 2594 mothers; of these, 
1519 (58%) were south Asian, 740 (29%) were white British, 
and 333 (13%) of another ethnicity (table 1). Data on 
ethnicity were missing for two participants. The mean 
age of the mothers was 33·6 years (SD 5·5) and the mean 
age of their child was 4·5 years (0·4). Cronbach’s alpha was 
0·75 for total difficulties, 0·62 for the internalising 
subscale, 0·70 for the externalising subscale, and 0·67 for 
the prosocial behaviour scale. NDVI was significantly 
higher (ie, residential spaces were greener) for white 
British mothers than for south Asian mothers across all 
three buffer zones (p<0·0001). Median distance from a 
major green space was 221 m (IQR 108–406) for all 
participants, and did not differ significantly between 
ethnic groups (p=0·05; table 1).

Data are n (%) plus median (IQR) or mean (SD). SDQ=Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (higher scores indicate more difficulties, with the exception of the prosocial behaviour scale where higher scores indicate more prosocial behaviour). 
NDVI=normalised difference vegetation index (higher scores indicate greener environments). IMD=Index of Multiple Deprivation (lower scores indicate more deprived areas). For household size, tertile 1 represents the smallest household size, 
whereas tertile 3 represents the largest household size. Numbers of white British, south Asian, and other ethnicity groups do not total 2594 as there were missing data on ethnicity for two participants. *p values test differences between white British 
and south Asian groups. Mann-Whitney U tests were used for non-parametric data, t-tests for parametric data, and χ² tests for categorical data.

832 (32%) of 2594 participants completed the additional 
questionnaire on green space use and satisfaction; these 
mothers reported lower SDQ scores and higher NDVI 
scores than the overall study sample, fewer mothers were 
married and living with their partner, and a higher 
proportion had higher levels of education, and reported 
lower levels of deprivation (appendix). No differences 
were noted when comparing the white British subsample 
with those who did not complete the additional 
questionnaire. However, south Asian mothers in the 
subsample reported lower SDQ scores, higher NDVI 
scores at all three buffers, higher levels of education, 
fewer reports of financial struggles, and fewer household 
members, and a slightly greater numbers of families 
were in the quintile of least deprivation than south Asian 
mothers in the overall sample.
More residential green space, as assessed by the NDVI, 
was associated with fewer total, internalising, and 
externalising behavioural difficulties in unadjusted 
models across all buffer zones (appendix). However, after 
controlling for sociodemographics, ethnicity, maternal 
smoking, and maternal mental health, these effects were 
non-significant. No associations between NDVI and 
prosocial behaviour were observed. Distance to major 
green spaces was not associated with any outcomes after 
adjustment and is thus not reported further.
With regard to associations between residential green 
spaces (assessed with NDVI) and children’s mental 
wellbeing, we found no moderation by socioeconomic 
status (maternal education or financial struggles; data not 
shown), but significant moderation of residential green 
space with total and internalising difficulties by ethnicity 
(p<0·05 for both across all buffer zones; data not shown). 
Table 2 reports stratified analyses for the two main ethnic 
groups within the sample. In the unadjusted and adjusted 
analyses, we saw no associations between residential 
green space (assessed by NDVI) and behavioural 
difficulties or prosocial behaviour for children of 
white British mothers. However, among south Asian 
participants, more residential green space was associated

with fewer behavioural difficulties across all three buffer 
zones in both unadjusted and adjusted models (table 2). 
We repeated analyses among south Asian participants, 
exploring externalising and internalising subscales and 
the prosocial scale separately. After adjusting for all 
relevant variables (model 4), we found that the impact of 
green space was only apparent for internalising 
behavioural difficulties, and not for the other sub-
components, across all three buffer zones (table 2).
We repeated stratified analyses within the subsample 
of respondents who completed additional questionnaires. 
Satisfaction with, and use of, green space varied by ethnic 
group (table 3). White British children spent significantly 
more time outside than south Asian children or children 
in the “Other ethnicity” category, and parents of white 
British children also reported significantly higher levels 
of satisfaction with their local green space than did those 
from other ethnic groups (p=0·001; table 3). In this 
subsample, a significant negative association was 
observed between green space and internalising 
behavioural 
difficulties 
only 
among 
children 
of 
south Asian mothers, with increasing green space as-
sociated with fewer internal 
ising behavioural difficult 
ies 
(appendix). This association was strongest in the 
unadjusted models (100 m: β –4·05 [95% CI –7·27 to 
–0·83]; 300 m: –4·96, [–8·38 to –1·54], 500 m: –4·60 
[–8·06 to –1·14]; appendix). Significant effects remained 
after adjustment for demographics (model 2) across all 
three buffer zones. When controlling further for 
deprivation (model 3), and maternal smoking and mental 
health (model 4), significant associations were found 
only for the 300 m and 500 m buffer zones (appendix).
In the final model, inclusion of time spent outside and 
satisfaction with green space rendered the influence of 
NDVI non-significant across all buffer zones. Within the 
south Asian subsample (n=344), satisfaction with local 
green spaces was associated with significantly fewer 
internalising behavioural difficulties within 100 m (table 4) 
and 300 m buffer zones (β –0·28 [95% CI –0·56 to –0·002]). 
Satisfaction with local green spaces was also associated 
with lower total behavioural difficulties across all three 
buffer zones (β –0·59 [95% CI –1·11 to –0·07]) and greater 
prosocial behaviour across all three buffer zones (0·20 
[0·02 to 0·38]; table 4). We found no associations between 
satisfaction with green spaces and externalising be-
havioural difficulties across any buffer zones (data not 
shown). Finally, time spent outdoors had no effect on 
total, externalising, and internalising behavioural difficult-
ies or on prosocial behaviour (table 4; only 100 m buffer 
results reported). Among the white British respondents, 
satisfaction with and use of green spaces were not 
associated with any measure of difficulty or prosocial 
behaviour (data not shown).
Discussion
We found a significant association between availability of 
green space (assessed by the NDVI) and both total and 
internalising behavioural difficulties among south Asian 
children living in a deprived urban area in the UK, but 
not among white British children. When satisfaction 
with and use of green space were included in our 
analyses, only satisfaction was significantly associated 
with mental wellbeing. Reported satisfaction with green 
space was independently predictive of internalising 
difficulties, total difficulties, and prosocial behaviour 
among south Asian children. Finally, we found that most 
of our study sample lived close to green spaces, and we 
found no associations between distance to green space 
and mental wellbeing.
Unlike some previous studies,8,22 we found no evidence 
of moderation of effects by socioeconomic indicators such 
as maternal education or subjective poverty. However, the 
present study was situated in a highly deprived location in 
the UK, and this lack of variability might have contributed 
to an inability to identify any differences by socioeconomic 
status. Issues of residual confounding due to our inability 
to control, for example, for income or social class might 
also have contributed to the findings.
Moderation by ethnicity was apparent, with as 
sociations 
between green space and children’s mental wellbeing 
observed only among south Asian children. We found 
that south Asian families faced a triple count of inequity 
in relation to green space. Not only did NDVI scores 
indicate that south Asian families had less residential

green space than their white British counterparts, they 
also reported less satisfaction with their green spaces, and 
that their children spent less time playing in green spaces. 
Furthermore, when satisfaction with green space was 
included in our analyses, it rendered the association of 
residential greenness non-significant. Satisfaction with 
green space was independently predictive of south Asian 
children’s mental wellbeing after controlling for 
demographics, socioeconomic status, maternal health 
behaviours, and maternal mental wellbeing. This is an 
important finding, suggesting that the quality, in addition 
to quantity, of green space is important for health. Some 
authors suggest that quality of green space can act as a 
moderating factor, meaning that associations between 
quantity of green space and health outcomes are stronger 
when quality is higher.28 We were unable to explore this 
association in our study as there was a mismatch in 
specificity for our quality indicator (satisfaction with a 
specific local green space) and our measure of quantity 
(NDVI in pre-specified buffer zones around residential 
addresses). Future research should aim to explore the 
potential moderating role of the quality of green space in 
association with health outcomes (ie, whether associations 
between wellbeing and quantity of green space are 
stronger when they are of higher quality than when they 
are of lower quality).
Internationally, evidence suggests that deprived groups 
have less access to green spaces than do less deprived 
groups.29 These inherent inequalities are further 
exacerbated if the quality of available green spaces in 
marginalised communities is worse than that of non-
marginalised communities. Within this setting, a study 
explored how the quality of local parks was linked to 
satisfaction and use (Roberts H, Department of 
Psychology, University of Leeds [Leeds, UK] and Bradford 
Institute for Health Research, Bradford Teaching 
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust [Bradford, UK], 
personal communication). The authors found that 
ratings of satisfaction were predicted solely by structural 
park features relating to quality such as the presence of 
amenities (eg, presence of toilets, benches, and shelters) 
and incivilities within the park (eg, presence of litter or 
evidence of antisocial behaviour) rather than by ethnic or 
socioeconomic characteristics of respondents. Poor 
quality parks and green spaces can discourage use by 
marginalised communities. Fears about safety and 
antisocial behaviour, and concerns about cleanliness and 
maintenance, are key barriers to green space use.30,31 
Policy makers need to recognise these inequities and 
work to improve the perceptions of local green spaces, in 
addition to prioritising continued investment for 
maintenance and improvement of these spaces. Effective 
interventions will take into account the needs and 
preferences of all groups who use green spaces to ensure 
that these spaces are acceptable to all, and to increase 
community ownership of local space. Co-design will be 
central to this process, and although evaluations of these 
types of interventions are rare, evidence is available to 
suggest that co-designing interventions with local 
communities can result in increased quality of,32 and use 
of,33 green spaces. Implementation of system-wide 
changes to improve local environments will be 
challenging and will require concerted multi-sector 
efforts and cooperation from health, public policy, and 
urban planning professionals, and community per-
spectives in order to be successful.34,35

Our study had various strengths. To our knowledge, 
this study is the first to explore the relative contribution 
of the availability of, satisfaction with, and use of green 
space on children’s mental wellbeing. This study was 
done within a deprived urban area with a multi-ethnic 
group of participants, and thus the findings are likely to 
be transferable to other multi-ethnic urban settings in 
the UK. We were able to control for an extensive array of 
potential confounding variables, including the effect of 
maternal mental distress on children’s wellbeing, to 
disentangle the independent effects of green space on 
health in this group.
There are, however, several limitations. We used a 
validated, parent-reported measure of children’s wellbeing; 
however, parental self-reporting could be subject to bias, 
including response bias. For example, a study found that 
associations between green space and wellbeing differed 
depending on whether parents or teachers were the 
primary informant.9 Future research should aim to 
replicate these findings with different tools to assess 
mental wellbeing within children. As mentioned above, 
our study sample was predominantly of south Asian origin 
and comprised individuals living within a highly deprived 
area.24 Therefore, our findings might not be generalisable 
to other more affluent and less ethnically diverse areas of 
the UK. Although we assessed the extent to which children 
played outside in green spaces, this outcome was self-
reported by parents and potentially subject to response 
bias. Additionally, bias in responses to questions on green 
space satisfaction and use might have been introduced 
because the additional subsample questionnaire was only 
available to English speakers. We were unable to control 
for more general physical activity within our analyses. 
Although we assessed a wide range of potential 
confounders, other unmeasured variables could have 
contributed to residual confounding. Our measure of 
green space was calculated with NDVI scores from two 
images assessed 5 years apart (which were selected as they 
had minimal cloud cover). This approach might have 
introduced bias in our assessment of green space; however, 
previous research has found NDVI to be highly stable 
across this time period in the current setting.21 Finally, our 
measure of green space satisfaction was based on 
respondents’ frequently used parks rather than general 
neighbourhood green space, and we did not include 
objective audit assessments of the quality of local parks. 
Future research should aim to include both objective and 
subjective assessments of quality when exploring 
associations with health outcomes, and should explore 
whether satisfaction with specific frequently used green 
spaces is more important for wellbeing than perceptions 
of the neighbourhood as a whole.
In conclusion, the quality, in addition to quantity, of 
green space might be important for the mental wellbeing 
of ethnic minority groups. Provision of green space alone 
is unlikely to produce health benefits for these groups. 
Multi-sector approaches combining health professionals, 
urban planners, policy makers, and communities are 
needed to develop new and creative solutions to improve 
the quality of local green spaces, and to increase 
satisfaction with green spaces among marginalised 
communities.
