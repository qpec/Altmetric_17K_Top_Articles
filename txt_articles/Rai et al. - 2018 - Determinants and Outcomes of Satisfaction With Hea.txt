Abstract
Background: Despite the surge of interest in improving provider communication, empirical research is sparse on the determinants and 
outcomes of cancer survivors’ satisfaction with healthcare provider communication. Methods: Longitudinal Medical Expenditure Panel 
Survey data spanning 2008 through 2014 was used to identify 4,588 respondents who were ever diagnosed with cancer. A composite score 
was generated by combining 5 measures of satisfaction. We used multivariate logistic regressions and 2-part models to examine the as-
sociations between satisfaction ratings and outcomes, including general, mental, and physical health; office visits; and total healthcare, 
drug, and out-of-pocket expenditures. Results: The study sample comprised 2,257 nonelderly (age 18–64 years) and 2,331 elderly (age ≥65 
years) respondents. Among both age groups, higher satisfaction was associated with fewer comorbidities, fewer year 1 office visits, and 
absence of year 1 emergency department visits. Membership of higher satisfaction tertile in year 1 was associated with better year 2 mental 
health (tertile 1 [T1]: predictive margin [PM], 27.1%; tertile 2 [T2]: PM, 35.5%; P=.013; tertile 3 [T3]: PM, 37.0%; P=.005) and general health 
 
(T1 [ref]: PM, 30.3%; T3: PM, 38.9%; P=.007) among the elderly. Greater satisfaction was associated with fewer year 2 office visits (T1 [ref]: 
PM, 7.42 visits; T3: PM, 6.26 visits; P=.038) among the nonelderly; and lower year 2 healthcare expenditures (T1 [ref]: PM, $34,071; T3: PM, 
$26,995; P=.049) among the elderly. Conclusions: We identified potential differences in cancer survivors’ needs and expectations of pro-
vider communication based on comorbidities and baseline service use. These results emphasize the need for individualized communication 
strategies for patients with cancer and survivors shaped by their distinct requirements. Our findings of better health, lower service use, and 
lower expenditures among more satisfied cancer survivors suggest that interventions to improve provider communication could lead to a 
more efficient use of healthcare resources.

Measurement of value in healthcare is key to the move-
ment from volume- to value-based delivery models. In 
its 2001 report, “Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New 
Health System for the 21st Century,” the Institute of 
Medicine recognized patient satisfaction as an important 
measure of value in healthcare.1 This report prompted 
extensive efforts to incorporate patients’ experience 
of care into pay-for-performance initiatives. A decade 
later, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act

Healthcare provider communication is especial-
ly germane to cancer care. The anxiety that accom-
panies cancer diagnosis and receipt of complex infor-
mation about treatments, costs, and prognosis5–7 may 
render patients more sensitive to what they perceive 
as particularly good care or communication. Effec-
tive communication between healthcare providers, 
patients, and families is vital at each point along the 
cancer care continuum, and especially so at the end 
of treatment. During this transition, fears about can-
cer recurrence and uncertainty of long-term surviv-
al come to the fore.8 Numerous questions also arise 
about next steps in care, including whom to consult, 
what tests to undergo, and how to manage late and 
lasting effects of cancer or its treatment.9 Addressing 
survivors’ emotional needs, effective communica-
tion, and information sharing are essential to patient- 
centered survivorship care planning.9 
In a 2007 monograph published by the NCI, 
Epstein and Street10 introduced a framework for 
patient-centered communication in cancer, orga-
nized around 6 functions: fostering healing rela-
tionships, exchanging information, responding to 
emotions, managing uncertainty, making decisions, 
and enabling patient self-management. The frame-
work conceptualized the role of a trusting patient– 
clinician relationship in optimal delivery of cancer 
survivorship care that would lead to better continu-
ity of care, adherence to treatment plans, reduced 
suffering, and reduced morbidity and mortality 
rates.10 Subsequent research led to the development 
of several survey measures for assessing patient-cen-
tered aspects of provider communication in cancer 
care.11–13 However, there is limited empirical research 
on survivor-level determinants of satisfaction with 
provider communication and ensuing outcomes, in-
cluding general, physical, and mental health; service 
utilization; and costs. 
The present study is an extension of an earlier 
inquiry into the determinants and outcomes of pa-
tient satisfaction with provider communication in 
the general population.14 We analyzed nationally 
representative longitudinal data to identify factors 
associated with cancer survivors’ satisfaction with 
healthcare provider communication and examined 
the associations between different levels of satisfac-
tion and short-term outcomes, including health sta-
tus, healthcare utilization, and expenditures.
Methods
Data Source and Study Population
The data for the study were obtained from the Medi-
cal Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) household 
component spanning 2008 through 2014 (panels 
13–19). The MEPS is a large, nationally represen-
tative survey of health status, healthcare utilization, 
experiences with care, and expenditures for the US 
noninstitutionalized civilian population.15 Each pan-
el consists of 5 rounds of surveys conducted over ap-
proximately 2 years. 
The study cohort was identified using the NCI’s 
Office of Cancer Survivorship definition of cancer 
survivorship, which states “an individual is consid-
ered a cancer survivor from the time of diagnosis 
through the balance of his or her life.”16 As such, the 
study cohort included newly diagnosed cancer survi-
vors, long-term cancer survivors, individuals receiv-
ing cancer treatment, and those who had completed 
treatment. Our study cohort is composed of adults 
aged ≥18 years who were ever diagnosed with cancer 
(nonmelanoma skin cancer excluded), had ≥1 physi-
cian or clinic visit 1 year prior to the first survey en-
counter, and had no missing data on all satisfaction 
measures in the first year of the panel. 
Satisfaction Measures
The healthcare provider communication compo-
nent of the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare 
Providers and Systems (CAHPS) included with the 
MEPS asks how often over the past 12 months the 
respondents’ physicians or other health providers ac-
complished the following: (1) listened carefully, (2) 
explained things in a way that was easy to under-
stand, (3) showed respect for what the respondent 
had to say, and (4) spent enough time with the re-
spondent. Response options covered a 4-point scale 
ranging from “never” to “always.” Additionally, the 
MEPS includes a measure of the respondents’ global 
rating of healthcare received in the past year, rang-
ing from 0 (“worst possible”) to 10 (“best possible”). 
This global satisfaction rating has been shown to 
be highly correlated with satisfaction with provider 
communication.17 We generated a composite satis-
faction score by using the standard approach of com-
bining the z scores (difference between the raw score 
and the sample mean of a measure divided by the 
standard deviation of the measure) of the 4 CAHPS 
measures and the global rating from year 1.18

Survivor Outcomes
We evaluated 3 categories of outcomes from year 2: 
health status, healthcare utilization, and healthcare 
expenditures. Mental and physical health status was 
measured using the Mental and Physical Component 
Summary scores derived from the 12-item Short 
Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-12v2).19 Addi-
tionally, the respondents’ health on the day of the 
interview (rated as excellent, very good, good, fair, 
or poor) was included as a measure of their general 
health status. Healthcare utilization was measured 
in terms of total number of emergency department 
(ED) visits, inpatient admissions, and office-based 
visits over the past year. Healthcare expenditures 
were measured as total healthcare expenditure, ex-
penditures on prescription drugs, and out-of-pocket 
expenditures over the past year. 
Determinants
Respondents’ age, sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic 
white or others), marital status (currently married 
or others), education (less than high school, high 
school, or college), poverty level (family income 
<100%–124%, 125%–399%, or ≥400% of federal 
poverty line), and smoking status were identified 
from panel-year 1 responses (Table 1). Access to 
healthcare was ascertained using health insurance 
status (any private, Medicare and/or Medicaid, or 
uninsured in age group 18–64 years; Medicare only, 
Medicare and private, or Medicare and other public 
in age group ≥65 years) and whether the respondents 
had a usual source of healthcare. The total num-
ber of comorbidities (0, 1, or ≥2 in age group 18–64 
years; 0, 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 in age group ≥65 years) from 
a list of 8 self-reported ailments (arthritis, asthma, 
cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, dia-
betes mellitus, emphysema, hypertension, and myo-
cardial infarction) was used to approximate baseline 
health status. Additional indicators of health status 
and proclivity to using healthcare included year 1 
Physical and Mental Component Summary scores, 
self-rated general health, office visits, ED visits, hos-
pitalizations, total healthcare expenditures, drug ex-
penditures, and out-of-pocket spending. Receipt of 
cancer-related treatment within 2 years of the survey 
was identified through prescriptions for antineoplas-
tic agents in the MEPS Prescribed Medicines file or 
through receipt of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, 
or surgery related to cancer in the Outpatient Visits, 
Office-Based Medical Provider Visits, and Hospital 
Inpatient Stays files.20
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were stratified by age group 
(18–64 years and ≥65 years). Analyses were con-
ducted to (1) identify the year 1 demographic and 
health-related attributes associated with year 1 sat-
isfaction with provider communication, and (2) ex-
amine adjusted health outcomes and resource use in 
year 2 associated with year 1 satisfaction with pro-
vider communication.  
Using multivariable logistic regression, we exam-
ined the associations between respondent characteris-
tics (year 1 sociodemographic features, insurance sta-
tus, usual source of care, comorbidity count, smoking 
status, active treatment status, tertile of office visits, 
any ED visits, and any inpatient care) and member-
ship of the highest satisfaction tertile. This categoriza-
tion of the dependent variable was based on distribu-
tions of the components of the composite score and 
motivated by the existing literature in this field.21–26 
Leveraging the panel design of MEPS, we exam-
ined the association between satisfaction measures 
in year 1 and outcomes in year 2. Year 2 indicators 
for excellent/very good general health, highest ter-
tile of mental health, and highest tertile of physi-
cal health were modeled using logistic regressions. 
We used 2-part models to account for the abundance 
of zero outcomes and skewed distributions of non-
zero outcomes in healthcare utilization and expen-
ditures. In the first part, we modeled the probability 
of an outcome being non-zero using logistic regres-
sion. In the second part, conditional on a positive 
outcome, the value of the outcome was fitted using 
appropriate regression models—Poisson regressions 
for healthcare use and gamma regressions with log 
link functions for expenditures. All regressions were 
controlled for the covariates listed earlier and strati-
fied by age.
Adjusted percentages of membership of a group, 
number of visits, and expenditures are presented as 
predictive margins (PMs), which standardize the 
outcome of each group to the covariate distribution 
of the population.27 All statistical tests were 2-sided 
and conducted at 5% level of significance using Sta-
ta/IC 14 (StataCorp LLC). We incorporated sam-
pling and post-stratification weights in all analyses 
to yield nationally representative estimates.

Results
We identified 4,588 cancer survivors, of which 2,257 
were nonelderly (age 18–64 years) and 2,331 were 
elderly (age ≥65 years). Respondents’ demographic, 
healthcare access, and baseline health characteris-
tics are listed in Table 1. The median age of the study 
sample was 54 years among the nonelderly cohort 
and 75 years among the elderly. Frequency distribu-
tions of cancer sites and specific comorbidities are 
displayed in supplemental eTables 1 and 2 (available 
with this article at JNCCN.org). As a comparison, 
eTable 2 also includes the frequency distribution of 
comorbidities among MEPS respondents without a 
cancer history from the corresponding panel-range. 
Figure 1 shows the distribution of scores for specific 
questions and global satisfaction ratings. 
Table 2 shows the results from multivariable lo-
gistic regression, with membership of the highest sat-
isfaction tertile as the dependent variable. Among 
the nonelderly, the odds of membership of the high-
est satisfaction tertile were higher among older re-
spondents (age 18–44 years: reference category [ref]; 
age 55–59 years: odds ratio [OR], 1.67; P=.002; age 
60–64 years: OR, 1.56; P=.016). In the same age 
group, satisfaction ratings were negatively associated 
with number of comorbidities (0 comorbidities: ref; 
≥2 comorbidities: OR, 0.69; P=.015) and increasing 
tertiles of office visits in year 1 (tertile 1 [T1]: ref; 
tertile 2 [T2]: OR, 0.76; P=.034; tertile 3 [T3]: OR,

0.54; P<.001). Among the elderly, satisfaction rat-
ings were lower among respondents with ≥4 comor-
bidities (0 comorbidities: ref; ≥4 comorbidities: OR, 
0.65; P=.044) and those with any ED visit in year 1 
(no ED visits: ref; any ED visit: OR, 0.63; P=.002). 
Among the elderly, higher patient satisfaction in 
year 1 was associated with membership of the high-
est year 2 mental health tertile (satisfaction T1 [ref]: 
PM, 27.1%; T2: PM, 35.5%; P=.013; T3: PM, 37.0%; 
P=.005), and the highest year 2 general health ter-
tile (T1 [ref]: PM, 30.3%; T3: PM, 38.9%; P=.007) 
 
(Table 3). Among the nonelderly, the relationship 
between satisfaction ratings and mental health was 
not consistent across satisfaction tertiles (T1 [ref]: 
PM, 29.7%; T2: PM, 36.0%; P=.036; T3: PM, 34.0%; 
P=.187). Highest year 1 satisfaction tertile was asso-
ciated with fewer office visits among the nonelderly 
(T1 [ref]: PM, 7.42; T3: PM, 6.26; P=.038) and lower 
year 2 total healthcare expenditure among the elder-
ly (T1 [ref]: PM, $34,071; T3: PM, $26,995; P=.049). 
Similarly, greater year 1 satisfaction was associated 
with lesser healthcare expenditure among the non-
elderly and fewer year 2 office visits among the el-
derly, but these results were statistically insignificant.
Discussion
In this study, we used a large nationally representa-
tive survey with longitudinal data to explore satis-
faction with healthcare provider communication 
among cancer survivors. Our primary findings were: 
(1) in both elderly and nonelderly cancer survivors, 
greater satisfaction with provider communication 
was associated with better baseline health status, as 
measured by fewer year 1 comorbidities, fewer office 
visits, or absence of ED visits; and (2) higher satisfac-
tion in year 1 was associated with better health rat-
ings, fewer office visits (nonelderly only), and lower 
total healthcare expenditure (elderly only) in year 2. 
The presence of multiple comorbidities may 
adversely influence satisfaction ratings through 
alternative pathways. Illness complexity is likely 
to affect a patient’s perception of the care experi-
ence.28,29 Alternatively, variations by comorbidities 
also may reflect genuine differences in the quality 
of care received. Providers may find it challenging 
to convey a large volume of information to clinical-
ly complex patients, especially within the resource 
and time constraints of an outpatient visit. Multi-
ple comorbidities also may lead to greater fragmen-
tation of care,30,31 which may adversely affect satis-
faction ratings.

Provider Communication in Cancer
981
Although the association between better base-
line health and greater satisfaction with provider 
communication has been reported earlier,14 a simi-
lar association among cancer survivors in the pres-
ent study deserves closer consideration. Not only 
are comorbid illnesses more common among cancer 
survivors than the general population32 but also a 
diagnosis of cancer may augment all the mentioned 
pathways. Thus, our results highlight the importance 
of accounting for patient mix in payment formulas 
to the extent that providers who care for complex 
cancer survivors are adequately compensated. At the 
same time, provider teams need to be equipped with 
systems and training to coordinate survivorship care.9 
It has been reported that, with increasing subspecial-
izations in cancer treatment, providers often lack the 
skills to manage the wide array of other ailments that 
may be present in this population.33 Therefore, it is 
incumbent on physician training programs to facil-
itate the development of skills required to care for 
complex survivors, including managing comorbidi-
ties, identifying and addressing special needs of those 
with multiple ailments, and coordinating care.
Our results are consistent with those of previous 
studies indicating associations among patient expe-
rience, clinical effectiveness, and patient safety. For 
instance, a meta-analysis showed that better quality 
of patient–provider communication was positively 
associated with adherence to treatment in an over-
whelming majority of studies.34 Better patient expe-

rience also has been found to be positively associated 
with medication compliance35–37 and performance 
on patient safety indicators.38 Recently, enhancing 
communication between patients with cancer and 
their healthcare team through electronic patient-
reported outcomes systems was shown to improve 
overall survival.39,40 
Effective patient–provider communication is 
beneficial for patients, clinicians, and hospitals alike. 
However, given the scarcity of time for such com-
munication, concerns have been raised that higher 
satisfaction ratings may align with greater volume 
of care and not necessarily with high-value care.41,42 
A previous analysis of the general population using 
the MEPS data found that higher satisfaction rat-
ings were associated with greater service use, includ-
ing inpatient visits and drug expenditures.14 Older 
studies also have linked patient satisfaction with 
the extent of fulfilment of patient requests.43,44 To 
the contrary, we found that greater satisfaction was 
associated with fewer physician office visits among 
younger respondents and lower total healthcare ex-
penditure among the elderly. These departures from 
earlier findings may stem from the greater complex-
ity of cancer survivorship care compared with the 
care delivered to the general population. Cancer sur-
vivors often require periodic visits to health profes-
sionals from multiple disciplines. Although vital, the 
frequency of these visits also can compound the dis-
tress caused by the diagnosis of cancer, its treatment,

and follow-up.45,46 In this context, effective provid-
er communication can streamline survivorship care 
and improve health outcomes by alleviating anxiety, 
boosting mutual trust, and enhancing self-care ef-
ficacy and adherence.10 Overall, our results suggest 
that addressing survivors’ concerns also align well 
with efficient use of healthcare services. That said, 
more research is needed to better understand the 
complex relationship between survivors’ satisfaction 
with provider communication and service use. 
Our findings should be interpreted in the light of 
several limitations. First, our study sample comprises 
cancer survivors in all phases of the cancer care con-
tinuum, including recently diagnosed and long-term 
survivors. The satisfaction scores that form the foun-
dation of our analyses also are not reflective specifi-
cally of the quality of cancer care received. Restrict-
ing the analysis to those with a recent diagnosis of 
cancer would have allowed us to better focus on sat-
isfaction with provider communication for cancer-
directed care. However, cancer survivors identified 
in household surveys such as the MEPS generally 
are long-term survivors. Furthermore, beginning in 
2013, variables indicating time since cancer diagno-
sis were removed from the MEPS for confidentiality 
concerns. Thus, the numbers of recently diagnosed 
survivors are insufficient for separate analyses. 
Second, in our examination of the relation-
ship between patient satisfaction and outcomes, we 
could not control for some potentially important 
confounders that were not available in the data, in-
cluding disease stage at diagnosis, all specific cancer 
treatments since diagnosis, time since last cancer-
directed treatment (for those not treated within 2 
years of survey), provider characteristics, and finan-
cial burden of cancer care. Information on cancer 
sites also could not be incorporated into the analy-
ses due to insufficient numbers. Future studies should 
address these limitations using larger, more-detailed, 
cancer-focused data to evaluate care experiences 
that are unique to cancer survivors. Potential data-
bases include the Consumer Assessment of Health-
care Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Cancer Care 
Survey and the SEER-CAHPS linked data.47–50 The 
former was designed to measure respondents’ experi-
ences while they receive cancer-directed treatments, 
whereas the SEER-CAHPS linkage provides data on 
Medicare beneficiaries’ experiences at various phases 
of cancer care. 
The above limitations notwithstanding, to our 
knowledge, this is the first nationally representative 
study of the drivers and outcomes of cancer survi-
vors’ satisfaction with provider communication. We 
identified important determinants of satisfaction 
with provider communication among cancer survi-
vors, including comorbidities and baseline service 
use. Our analyses adjusted for a comprehensive list 
of factors that may affect satisfaction with provider 
communication and estimated the short-term out-
comes of satisfaction by taking advantage of the pan-
el design of the MEPS. 
Conclusions
The ongoing improvement in cancer survival has re-
sulted in a population of survivors with many unique 
medical and psychosocial needs. Our results high-
light the need for individualized communication 
strategies in cancer survivorship care. Notably, our 
results suggest that improving cancer survivors’ sat-
isfaction with provider communication would lead 
to better health outcomes in an efficient manner. 
Great interest is being shown in how to measure sys-
tematically and improve provider communication in 
cancer survivorship care. To those ends, our findings 
will motivate future inquiries into effective provider 
communication along the cancer care continuum, 
preferably using novel, cancer-based data sources, 
including the CAHPS Cancer Care Survey and the 
SEER-CAHPS linked data.
