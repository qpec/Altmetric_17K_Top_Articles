Abstract
Pathogens often follow more than one transmission route during outbreaks—from needle
sharing plus sexual transmission of HIV to small droplet aerosol plus fomite transmission of
influenza. Thus, controlling an infectious disease outbreak often requires characterizing the
risk associated with multiple mechanisms of transmission. For example, during the Ebola
virus outbreak in West Africa, weighing the relative importance of funeral versus health care
worker transmission was essential to stopping disease spread. As a result, strategic policy
decisions regarding interventions must rely on accurately characterizing risks associated
with multiple transmission routes. The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak challenges our
conventional methodologies for translating case-counts into route-specific transmission
risk. Critically, most approaches will fail to accurately estimate the risk of sustained sexual
transmission of a pathogen that is primarily vectored by a mosquito—such as the risk of sus-
tained sexual transmission of ZIKV. By computationally investigating a novel mathematical
approach for multi-route pathogens, our results suggest that previous epidemic threshold
estimates could under-estimate the risk of sustained sexual transmission by at least an
order of magnitude. This result, coupled with emerging clinical, epidemiological, and experi-
mental evidence for an increased risk of sexual transmission, would strongly support recent
calls to classify ZIKV as a sexually transmitted infection.
Author summary
The national and international community is grappling with how to respond to the ongo-
ing Zika virus outbreak. One of the most uncertain aspects of this disease is its potential
for sustained sexual transmission. Recent studies have suggested that there are large differ-
ences in the age- and sex-specific Zika virus attack rates—with women of childbearing age
having the highest incidence of infection—and that the risk of sustained sexual transmis-
sion may be low. Here we investigate the novel epidemiological behavior of an infection

 that is transmitted both sexually and by a mosquito vector. Using data-driven simulations,
we demonstrate how conventional methods can substantially underestimate the risk of
sustained sexual transmission for Zika outbreaks. More specifically, we find that the
threshold for large-scale, sustained sexual transmission could easily be underestimated by
a factor of ten or higher using existing models. Finally, we discuss how such an underesti-
mate will lead to ineffective responses and a drastic underestimation of the risk associated
with Zika persistence and re-emergence.
Introduction
Recent epidemiological [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], clinical [6, 7, 8], and experimental [9, 10, 11] evidence
suggests that Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a risk for sexual transmission. These findings, which
include anecdotal examples of sexual transmission in humans [1], substantial asymmetries in
observed age- and sex-specific ZIKV attack rates across Central and South America [3], persis-
tent viral shedding in bodily fluids [6] leading to transmission months after initial symptom
onset [12], and high rates of sexual transmission in mouse [9] and macaque [10] animal mod-
els, have led to an ongoing debate about whether to classify ZIKV as a sexually transmitted
infection (STI) [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] and recommendations from the US CDC for couples to take
precautions after returning from ZIKV endemic areas [18]. From a public health perspective,
it is critically important to determine whether sexual transmission of ZIKV is likely to be spo-
radic or sustained. Sustained sexual transmission would have the immediate effect of increas-
ing the number of cases during local outbreaks, and a longer-term effect if it led to endemic
maintenance of ZIKV in regions that would otherwise experience only sporadic outbreaks.
Lastly, emerging evidence from experimental transmission studies in mice suggest that sexual
transmission may lead to higher rates of ZIKV-associated birth defects such as microcephaly
[19]. Mathematical transmission models allow us to formally evaluate and quantify the risk of
sustained sexual transmission of ZIKV. Here, we use data-driven simulations of such models
to inform estimates of the risk of sustained sexual transmission of ZIKV.
An infectious disease is unlikely to generate a large outbreak if its basic reproductive num-
ber, R0, is less than one. With R0 � 1, each infected individual will on average give rise to at
least one additional case and the outbreak will be self-sustaining in a large population; while
the transmission process dies out if R0 < 1 as individuals give rise to less than one additional
case on average. Therefore, public health officials are interested in both estimating R0 and eval-
uating which interventions are most likely to reduce it. In the unique situation of sexual trans-
mission of ZIKV, we must consider the following three issues when calculating R0 and
constructing mathematical/computational transmission models: (1) individuals infected by
the mosquito vector are not necessarily part of the branching process over the network of sex-
ual contacts; (2) all infections are not equivalent—there is a strong asymmetry in sexual trans-
mission as men are infectious for much longer than women [8]; and (3) symptoms, and thus
the probability of detection, are also heterogeneous [20].
To date, the majority of models published on ZIKV spread have focused exclusively on
mosquito-driven transmission and can be roughly divided into statistical [21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
differential equation-based [26, 27, 28, 29], and agent-based models [30]. The studies that
included sexual transmission have all made a number of simplifying assumptions, which we
relax in our investigation. For example, Gao et al. (2016) assumed that transmission occurred
via monogamous, heterosexual partnerships with equal risk of transmission from either males
or females [31]. As we detail below, these assumptions are both incompatible with existing

 data on ZIKV sexual transmission [7, 8] and, more importantly, will likely underestimate the
risk of sustained sexual transmission [32, 33]. Additionally, Brauer et al. (2016) and Agusto
et al. (2017) found that including sexual transmission allows for an endemic equilibrium with
R0 < 1 for sexual transmission [34, 35]; however, both assumed that sexual contacts occur ran-
domly and are equal in number across individuals. Again, these assumptions are both untrue
of sexual contact networks [36] and will likely underestimate the risk of transmission [32, 33].
Aside from complications due to the vector and modeling assumptions, the risk of sexual
transmission of ZIKV is itself confounded due to vast differences in the infectivity and longev-
ity of ZIKV in semen [8] vs. vaginal fluids [7]. The epidemiological consequences of this asym-
metry partially explains why females are significantly less likely to transmit ZIKV to their
sexual partner than males [7, 8] and evidence exists for male-to-male sexual transmission [4],
despite no active screening in communities of men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM). This
asymmetry in transmission has also been demonstrated in a mouse model of sexual transmis-
sion, where males were infectious for significantly longer than females and >70% of sexual
contacts between infected males and uninfected females led to transmission [9]. Additionally,
in a mouse exposure trial, 100% of intrarectal exposures led to infection, as compared to 50%
of intravaginal exposures [10]. The goal of this work is therefore to relax the aforementioned
modeling assumptions and include asymmetry in infectivity/viral longevity between males
and females in order to study how the unique nature of ZIKV transmission, i.e. mosquito- and
sexually-driven, interacts with heterogeneity in sexual contact networks and transmission
asymmetry to determine both the expected epidemic size and probability of endemic
establishment.
Methods
To investigate the effect of relaxing the aforementioned assumptions, we employ the modeling
approach of asymmetric bond percolation on random sexual networks [32, 37]. At its core,
this approach uses synthetic random sexual networks generated as follows. (1) A population of
N individuals is assumed to be equally split between men and women, of which 5% are homo-
sexuals, 3% are bisexuals and 92% are heterosexuals (conservative values determined from
published estimates [38, 39, 40]), thus yielding six types of nodes (individuals). (2) To account
for heterogeneity in the number of contacts, individuals are assigned a number of sexual con-
tacts drawn from distributions conservatively extrapolated from Ref. [39] (for homosexual
contacts) and Ref. [38] (for heterosexual contacts). (3) Sexual partnerships are then formed at
random following the individuals’ sexual orientation. For instance, bisexual women choose
their partners randomly in the pools of heterosexual men, bisexual men and women, and
homosexual women. (4) Finally, each sexual partnership is translated into a set of directed
links between the two partners depending on whether transmission would eventually occur
should one of them become infected by ZIKV. More precisely, in a sexual partnership between
nodes i and j, a directed link from i to j is added with probability T if i is a man, or with proba-
bility T/ε if i is a woman to account for the observed strong asymmetry in the probability of
transmission (i.e., women are ε times less likely to transmit ZIKV than men). Since both direc-
tions are considered, any partnership (i, j) can therefore lead to (i) no link, (ii) a directed link
from i to j, (iii) a directed link from j to i or (iv) two directed links running in opposite direc-
tions. The resulting semi-directed network then corresponds to the sexual transmission paths
that ZIKV will follow should a node get infected by a mosquito. The conclusions of this paper
are based on data from numerical simulations and from direct measurements of these syn-
thetic sexual networks. Note that these data were averaged over many realizations of the
networks.

 Conceptually, we decompose the traditional measure of R0 for a sexually transmitted infec-
tion into three distinct measures of secondary case potential on which we will elaborate in the
Results section:
• Rtotal
0
: Conceptually similar to the traditional measure of R0 or roughly, the average number
of secondary sexual infections directly caused by any infected individual. While this measure
includes secondary sexual infections from both vector- and non-vector-derived cases, it
excludes secondary infections caused by ongoing vector-mediated transmission;
• Rsexual
0
: Average number of secondary infections directly caused by an individual infected
sexually, i.e. individuals infected by the vector are excluded;
• RMSM
0
: Similar to Rsexual
0
but only taking into account individuals with ongoing sexual con-
tacts in the men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) community.
Additionally, we characterize the overall threat of ZIKV as an STI by measuring the poten-
tial prevalence of the epidemic and potential for sustained, endemic transmission. This quan-
tity corresponds to the macroscopic fraction of nodes that will eventually be reached by
following any link from a given node (assuming that patient zero was infected by a mosquito).
In practice, this fraction is considered macroscopic if it is greater than N/500.
This modeling approach uses asymmetric bond percolation on static networks as a “first
order” approximation of a spreading dynamic in which true sexual contacts change over time
and where timescales, both of the contact-swapping dynamics and the infectious period,
greatly influence the outcomes. Although seemingly simplistic, this approach nevertheless cap-
tures key features of ZIKV outbreaks, namely asymmetric probability of transmission and het-
erogeneous number of sexual contacts. An important extension of our work would be to study
ZIKV transmission on a dynamic contact network; however, the currently available data on
sexual contact networks is likely too coarse-grained for such an analysis to be empirically
grounded. It is also worth mentioning that the modeling approach used in this study typically
applies when there is only a small number of initial seeds (i.e., mosquito transmission events).
While this makes our conclusions more applicable in regions without a viable mosquito vector
but where people may bring back ZIKV with them after a trip to endemic regions, recent
results showing an important asymmetry in incidence between men and women [3] strongly
suggest that our conclusions are relevant for endemic regions as well.
Results
An adequate threat assessment tool
While it is tempting to evaluate the sexual R0 ðRsexual
0
Þ of ZIKV by averaging the number of sex-
ual transmissions caused by all known infected individuals—which was the approach taken by
Brauer et al. (2016) and Agusto et al. (2017)—it is not correct when transmission occurs on
real-world sexual contact networks, which are notoriously heterogeneous [36]. Therefore, to
estimate Rsexual
0
correctly, we need to evaluate the number of secondary infections caused by
individuals who were infected sexually. The intuition behind this observation is that individu-
als infected by a mosquito will be “randomly” drawn from the total population (and thus have
a number of sexual partners drawn from a distribution {pk}), whereas individuals infected sex-
ually must be conditioned on having at least one contact. As a result of this conditioning, the
sexually infected person is already 10 times more likely to have 10 contacts than only one con-
tact (their number of sexual partners is thus drawn from a distribution proportional to {kpk}).
This distinction between mosquito- and sexually-infected individuals derives from the classic
network theory phenomenon of “your friends have more friends than you do” [41]. Note that

 this distinction does not imply that sexually-infected individuals have more heterogeneity in
social connections than mosquito-infected individuals, but rather means that the dynamics of
sexual infections are biased towards more connected individuals, which then implies that indi-
viduals infected sexually have, on average, a higher opportunity for subsequent secondary
transmission.
For a sexually transmitted infection on a contact network, the outcome of having to condi-
tion on individuals being infected via a sexual contact is that the critical network metric is not
the expected number of transmitting contacts, hki, but is instead the expected excess number
of transmitting contacts: the number of links other than the one through which they were
infected, hkei [42]. In contrast, for individuals who are infected by a mosquito we must use the
expected number of transmitting contacts, because the infection was transmitted to them by
the vector and not by one of their sexual/social contacts (see Fig 1). This matters because hkei
Fig 1. Women and men are shown in orange and blue, respectively, with squares indicating vector-
infected individuals and circles corresponding to infections acquired sexually. Since most vector-
infected individuals typically transmit ZIKV to 0 or 1 sexual partners, a biased estimate of the relevant
reproductive number for sexual transmission risk (Rtotal
0
), will be obtained when considering all infections, thus
inaccurately suggesting that ZIKV cannot be a self-sustaining STI (one would correctly determine that
Rtotal
0
⪡1; however, this quantity underestimates the risk of sexual transmission). Considering only
transmissions caused by sexually-infected individuals corrects for the bias, but still may not provide a
complete assessment of the threat posed by ZIKV as an STI (Rsexual
0
< 1). In fact, because of the highly
asymmetric sex-dependent probability of transmission of ZIKV, an epidemic is likely to occur in the men-who-
have-sex-with-men (MSM) community with some spillover transmission to the population not active in the
MSM community, a situation that can only be modeled through a well-suited community-specific reproductive
number (e.g., RMSM
0
> 1).

 is larger than hki whenever the variance of the number of transmitting contacts, Var[k],
exceeds hki. Only for unrealistic contact distribution, such as the Poisson distribution consid-
ered by well-mixed compartmental models of ZIKV or a Dirac delta distribution, will hkei be
equal to or lower than hki (respectively). Thus, in all realistic cases, individuals infected sexu-
ally are expected to have a greater number of contacts than individuals infected by the vector.
And because sexual contact networks are known to be heterogeneous [36, 38, 39], we expect
the difference between the two to be quite significant. An accurate assessment of ZIKV’s
potential as a self-sustaining STI can therefore only be obtained by explicitly discarding any
vector-caused infections in the measurement of Rsexual
0
(see Fig 1 and the left panel of Fig 2).
The most at-risk individuals
Because of the asymmetry in infectious period between males (>180 days [8]) and females
(<20 days [7]), coupled with evidence for increased infectivity of males [9], it is likely easier
for ZIKV to invade the MSM community. Consider two infectious males, one in the MSM
community and one not in the MSM community. ZIKV only needs to be transmitted to at
least one other individual on average to permit an epidemic in the MSM community, whereas
in the non-MSM community, ZIKV needs to infect enough females such that they will
together infect at least one other male. In other words, using the terminology described in
Fig 2. left panel: Considering a scenario in which women are 10 times less likely to transmit ZIKV than men (ε = 10), the dotted, dashed and solid lines
show three estimates of the basic reproductive number R0 associated with sexual transmissions: (i) Rtotal
0
is the average number of secondary infections
due to all infected individuals, including by the vector, (ii) Rsexual
0
is the average number of secondary infections resulting from individuals infected sexually,
and (iii) RMSM
0
is the average number of secondary infections resulting from individuals in the MSM community who were infected sexually. These estimates
are computed by counting the number of sexual infections caused by the individuals infected by the vector and/or their direct neighbors (see Methods).
These various R0 estimates indicate that the transmission probability is at the epidemic threshold when they are equal to one (large dots). The community-
specific RMSM
0
is the only observable that adequately measures when ZIKV could invade the MSM community; the other metrics falsely imply that sustained
sexual transmission is unlikely; critically, Rtotal
0
leads to an overestimation of the epidemic threshold, Tc, by an order of magnitude (i.e., 0.35 versus 0.03).
right panel: Prevalence of ZIKV in the whole population and in two sub-populations (MSM and all heterosexuals) as a function of T using ε = 2 and only
considering individuals with more than one sexual partner (as a rough approximation of the sexually active population). The vertical, dashed-gray lines
show the threshold values for a self-sustained epidemic within the MSM community (with subcritical spillovers in the rest of the population, shaded area),
and within the entire population (i.e., supercritical outbreaks exist both within and outside of the MSM community), see Eqs (1) and (2). Note that the
prevalence outside of the MSM community start rising at the threshold for endemic transmission in the MSM population because of sub-critical spillovers.
Note also that we used ε = 2 instead of ε = 10 for pedagogical reasons since it facilitated the presentation of the results and is clearly conservative with
respect to our conclusions.

where hkeiMSM, hkeiMH, and hkeiWH are the average excess number of potential disease-trans-
mitting contacts of the MSM community and of the heterosexual men and women, respec-
tively (note that multiplying these quantities by T or T/ε yields the average excess number of
transmitting contacts). Hence, even if all sub-groups had the same average excess degree
(which is generally not the case), we expect two different epidemic thresholds [32]: one for a
large-scale epidemic in the MSM community (from which small subcritical outbreaks will spill-
over in the rest of the population); and a higher transmission threshold for an epidemic in the
remaining population (see Fig 2). Note also that the stronger the asymmetry in infectious
period, the more different these thresholds become, thus departing from the traditional phe-
nomenology of core groups [43]. Indeed, in the case of ZIKV, belonging to the core group
does not necessarily imply an above-average sexual activity, but merely a specific sex and sex-
ual orientation (MSM).
To combine the effects of the multiple transmission pathways and asymmetric transmis-
sion, we simulated ZIKV transmission on a sexual contact network parameterized with empir-
ical data on contact distributions, population demography, sexual orientation, and disease-
specific transmission parameters (see Methods and Fig 2). The left panel of Fig 2 corroborates
our previous discussion about the proper way to assess whether a macroscopic epidemic is
likely to occur: to consider only sexual transmissions within the MSM community because of
ZIKV’s multiple transmission pathways and extreme sex-based asymmetry in the probability
of sexual transmission. Furthermore, the results shown in Fig 2 suggest that the threshold for
large-scale, sustained sexual transmission could easilybe underestimated by a factor of ten or
higher using traditional models. Critically, because the number of sexual contacts within the
MSM community is expected to be both higher on average and more heterogeneous than in
the heterosexual population [38, 39], we expect a significant gap between the two epidemic
thresholds as shown in the right panel of Fig 2. This means that given the high level of asym-
metry between probabilities of men-to-women and women-to-men transmissions, there is a
potential for sustained epidemics within the MSM community but sub-critical in the rest of
the population.
Surveillance blind spot
Coupled with biases in surveillance, an insidious aspect of the double epidemic threshold of
Fig 2 is that one of the most likely outcomes—an epidemic mostly contained within the MSM
community—is also the hardest outcome to detect. ZIKV infections in adults are largely
asymptomatic [20] and, therefore, most testing occurs in the roughly 20% of cases that are
symptomatic or in individuals seeking to have children [44]. The vast majority of these indi-
viduals will be outside of the MSM community [44]. However, as stated above, due to male-to-
male sexual transmission of ZIKV [4], the group most likely to see sustained sexual transmis-
sion is the group least likely to be tested. Further, it will lead to biased estimates in the potential

 for sustained sexual transmission of ZIKV. Finally, the US FDA restricts individuals who self
identify as members of the MSM community from donating blood if they have had sexual con-
tact with another man in the past twelve months [45]. Because donor blood is now routinely,
and retrospectively, screened for Zika infection [44, 46, 47, 48], the surveillance situation is fur-
ther biased against the most at-risk group for sustained sexual transmission.
Empirical estimation of women-to-men probability of transmission
Between the two epidemic thresholds, there is a sustained epidemic within the MSM commu-
nity that leads to sub-critical, but recurrent, outbreaks in the heterosexual population. From a
network perspective, these outbreaks are bipartite infection trees (from women to men to
women to men, etc.) with average branching factors ThkeiMH for men and ThkeiWH/ε for
women, and always start with a woman who has been infected by a bisexual man himself part of
the sustained epidemic among the MSM community. This last observation is important because
it implies that a higher incidence in women should be observed in the heterosexual community.
Indeed, if heterosexual men could also be at the origin of sub-critical outbreaks, we would
expect equal incidence between men and women since both bipartite infection trees have the
same combined branching factor, Rsexual
0
. However, for every woman starting an heterosexual
outbreak, we have only ThkeiWH/ε heterosexual men continuing that outbreak. This implies
that the ratio of prevalence of men to women is expected to be ThkeiWH/ε, which is smaller than
one below the second epidemic threshold. This observation is validated in Fig 3 and yields two
important implications. First, it tells us that the ratio of incidence between heterosexual men
and women is not impacted by the expected excess degree of men hkeiMH. Second, empirical

simulations for the ratio using ε = 5 while keeping the same values for hkeiWH and hkeiMH as in the left panel (respectively 2.03 and 2.20). The red solid line
shows the results for ε = 3, an increased value of hkeiMH (3.51) and an unchanged value of hkeiWH. Notice how the slope increases by a factor 5/3. The blue
solid line shows a similar scenario as the red one, but one where hkeiWH has also been increased (2.75), thus yielding a steeper slope. Finally, the orange
dotted line (almost completely under the blue one) shows the same scenario as the blue line, but one in which the average excess degree of bisexual men
has been increased (from 5.40 to 7.72 without any effect, as predicted). The vertical dashed gray lines show the different thresholds corresponding to their
respective R0 equals 1 (see Eqs (1) and (2)). Altogether, these results confirm that hkeiWH and T/� are the only quantities affecting the risk factor of
heterosexual women compared to men.

 measurements of the prevalence ratio can therefore serve as an estimate of ThkeiWH/ε, which
can then be used to estimate the women-to-men probability of transmission, T/ε, since the aver-
age excess degree of heterosexual women, hkeiWH, can be estimated using other traditional
means. Evidence supporting these model-based conclusions evidence does exist for ZIKV sexual
transmission. Specifically, Coelho et al found a 90% higher incidence of ZIKV infection in
women of reproductive age (15 to 65 years old) compared to men, adjusted for gender-related
health-seeking behavior and pregnancy status [3].
Discussion
Sustained sexual transmissions of ZIKV in the MSM community would lead to sporadic sub-
critical, but potentially dramatic spillover outbreaks in the heterosexual community, and
would increase the probability of endemic establishment of ZIKV. Our result that sexual trans-
mission increases the potential epidemic size and the probability of establishment supports
earlier findings from Gao et al. (2016). However, previously published models of sexual trans-
mission do not permit contact heterogeneity nor asymmetry in infectivity. Although we do
not study the quantitative effect of heterogeneity, we rather discuss how R0 should be mea-
sured and contextualized when heterogeneity and/or asymmetry exists. Specifically, using a
data-driven, but still largely minimal and naive model, we show that the difference in the esti-
mated values of R0 can lead to drastically different conclusions in terms of the epidemic risk
and the probability of disease persistence. Hence, given our evolving understanding of the clin-
ical outcomes for ZIKV infection in adults [49], which, in addition to fever, rash, etc., include
autoimmune disorders [50], thrombocytopenia [49], hearing loss [51], and harm to reproduc-
tive organs [52] (including risk of fertility issues in males resulting from testicular atrophy
[53]), it may be prudent from an individual perspective, as well as a population-level perspec-
tive, to increase testing for all adults. Taken together, our results support recent calls to for-
mally consider ZIKV to be a sexually transmitted infection [10, 15, 16, 17, 54].
Public health decision- and policy-makers rely on accurate characterizations of transmis-
sion risk to decide on interventions and strategically allocate limited resources. For pathogens,
like ZIKV, which are both vectored by an insect and transmitted sexually (with sex-based
asymmetry in transmission rate), conventional approaches will underestimate the risk associ-
ated with sexual transmission. Underestimating the risk of sexual transmission, both in terms
of the average transmission risk and variation in transmission risk, will lead both to biased
intervention efforts and to an underestimate of the potential for disease persistence. Addition-
ally, given the differential rates of ZIKV testing in MSM versus non-MSM communities and
the known heterogeneity between their contact distributions, the data on sexual transmission
are almost certainly biased. We also do not have sufficient experimental or epidemiological
evidence for the per-contact probability of transmission in the MSM community. Here we
advocate for the decision-making and disease modeling communities to better embrace con-
tact network methods when characterizing transmission risk and for increased ZIKV testing
in both MSM and non-MSM communities. The resulting estimates of transmission risk and
key epidemiological measures, e.g. R0 and the likelihood of disease persistence, will be more
accurate.
