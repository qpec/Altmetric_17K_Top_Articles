Impaired hepatic glucose uptake (HGU) causes postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 dia-
betes. Here, we show that diminished hepatic Sirt2 activity impairs HGU in obese diabetic
mice. Hepatic Sirt2 overexpression increases HGU in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese diabetic
mice and mitigates their impaired glucose tolerance. Hepatic Sirt2 knockdown in non-diabetic
mice reduces HGU and causes impaired glucose tolerance. Sirt2 promotes glucose-
dependent HGU by deacetylating K126 of glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). Glucoki-
nase and GKRP glucose-dependent dissociation is necessary for HGU but is inhibited in
hepatocytes derived from obese diabetic mice, depleted of Sirt2 or transfected with GKRP
acetylation-mimicking mutants. GKRP deacetylation-mimicking mutants dissociate from
glucokinase in a glucose concentration-dependent manner in obese diabetic mouse-derived
hepatocytes and increase HGU and glucose tolerance in HFD-induced or db/db obese dia-
betic mice. We demonstrate that Sirt2-dependent GKRP deacetylation improves impaired
HGU and suggest that it may be a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes.

ostprandial hyperglycemia is closely associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular complications and lethality
in type 2 diabetes1–3. Hepatic glucose uptake (HGU)
accounts for one-third of food-derived exogenous glucose uptake4
and impaired HGU in obesity and type 2 diabetes causes post-
prandial hyperglycemia5,6. Faulty hepatic glucokinase activation
is reported to be responsible for the HGU impairment in type 2
diabetes5,7, but the precise mechanism of the HGU and gluco-
kinase activation impairment remains to be elucidated.
Glucokinase plays a prominent role in postprandial HGU8.

 gluconeogenic enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). HGU is
based on the balance between glucokinase and G6Pase9, but
hepatic G6Pase activity is not significantly altered until 90 min
postprandial10. The acute increase in hepatic glucokinase activity
in response to the postprandial increase in blood glucose level is
mainly induced by a post-translational mechanism dependent on
glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP)8. GKRP inhibits glucoki-
nase activity by binding to the enzyme, and glucose dissociates
GKRP from glucokinase and thereby activates glucokinase8,11.
Small-molecule glucokinase–GKRP disruptors that promote the
dissociation of glucokinase−GKRP binding lower blood glucose
levels in obese diabetic mice12, indicating the importance of GKRP
in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. However, the role of
GKRP in the HGU impairment in type 2 diabetes remains unclear.
Hepatic glucose metabolism derangement in type 2 diabetes is

 tide (NAD+), an energy balance indicator13–15. A high-fat diet
(HFD) reduces hepatic NAD+ levels, and this NAD+ reduction in
HFD-fed mice results from compromised NAD+ biosynthesis
mediated by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt),
the rate-limiting enzyme in NAD+ biosynthesis16. Furthermore,
administration of the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide mono-
nucleotide (NMN) restores the hepatic NAD+ level, which
counteracts the impaired glucose tolerance caused by HFD
intake16. Sirtuins, which are NAD+-dependent deacetylases, play
a significant role in the effects of NAD+ on hepatic glucose
metabolism. There are seven mammalian sirtuins (Sirt1 to 7),
with Sirt1 and 3 involved in glucose and energy metabolism15,17.
Sirt1, expressed in cell nuclei, deacetylates the transcriptional
regulation of metabolism-related genes and regulates hepatic
glucose
metabolism14,18.
Sirt3
deacetylates
mitochondrial
enzymes and promotes fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis19,20.
The function of Sirt2 partially overlaps with that of Sirt1 because
both deacetylate the histone H4K1621, but its role in hepatic
glucose metabolism regulation is unclear. Sirt2 is mainly present
in the cytosol and is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal
proteins22; in the liver, Sirt2 is reported to deacetylate keratin 823.
Here, we found that NAD+ depletion is involved in the HGU
impairment of obese diabetic mice and that Sirt2 plays an
important role in this process via GKRP deacetylation. Moreover,
impeded Sirt2-dependent GKRP deacetylation reduced HGU and
glucose tolerance, and Sirt2 overexpression or deacetylation-
mimicking GKRP mutant ameliorated the HGU impairment and
improved glucose tolerance in obese diabetic mice.
Results
NAD+ restoration increases HGU in obese diabetic mice. Pri-
mary hepatocytes derived from leptin receptor-deficient obese
diabetic db/db mice contained numerous lipid droplets, had lower
NAD+ content, and displayed reduced 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)
uptake compared with their lean mouse-derived counterparts
(Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1a). The NAD+ precursor
NMN (Fig. 1c) restored the NAD+ levels in db/db mouse-derived
primary hepatocytes and increased their 2-DG uptake (Fig. 1a, b).
There was no clear change in glucokinase protein expression or in
the expressions of G6pc and Gck genes, encoding G6Pase and
glucokinase, respectively (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1b). A
reduction in NAD+ levels in lean mouse-derived primary hepa-
tocytes via Nampt knockdown decreased the 2-DG uptake,
despite the increase in Gck gene expression (Fig. 1e, f and Sup-
plementary Fig. 1c). Restoration of the NAD+ content of Nampt
knockdown hepatocytes with NMN reversed the 2-DG uptake
impairment without changing the Gck gene expression (Fig. 1e, f
and Supplementary Fig. 1c). Exposure to gallotannin (Fig. 1c), a
nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat) inhi-
bitor that catalyzes NAD+ biosynthesis from NMN, reduced the
NAD+ quantity regardless of the presence of NMN (Fig. 1g), as
reported previously16. In addition, 2-DG uptake was impaired;
this impairment was not reversed by NMN (Fig. 1h). Gallotannin
exposure reduced G6pc gene expression but did not have any
clear effect on Gck gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 1d).
Obese diabetic HFD-fed mice had less hepatic NAD+ than
mice fed a normal chow (NC) diet (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

NMN-administered
HFD-fed
mice
showed
restored hepatic NAD+ levels, increased insulin secretion, and
ameliorated
impaired
glucose
tolerance
(Supplementary
Fig. 2a–c), as reported before16. We further studied the effect of
NMN on the blood glucose level under the inhibition of
endogenous insulin secretion via continuous administration of
somatostatin (Supplementary Fig. 2d). The impaired glucose
tolerance
of the HFD-fed mice was improved by NMN
administration, even with somatostatin administration, coinci-
dent with an increase in hepatic NAD+ levels (Fig. 1i and
Supplementary Fig. 2e). Next, we investigated the effect of NMN
administration on 2-DG uptake by the liver, white adipose tissue
(WAT), and skeletal muscle in obese diabetic HFD-fed mice
during hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic clamping (Fig. 1j). In the
NMN-administered group, 2-DG uptake was augmented in the
liver, although G6pc gene expression and glucokinase gene and
protein expressions were unaffected (Fig. 1k–m). No clear
changes were observed in the skeletal muscle and WAT (Fig. 1k).
Sirt2 knockdown impedes NAD+-dependent HGU. To eluci-
date the role of sirtuins in the HGU reduction after cellular NAD
+ depletion, we knocked down Sirt1–7 in primary hepatocytes
and investigated the effect on glucose uptake. Primary hepatocyte
2-DG uptake was only reduced by Sirt2 knockdown, without
changes in Gck and G6pc gene expressions (Fig. 2a and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3a). The sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide and the Sirt2
inhibitor AGK2 reduced 2-DG uptake by primary hepatocytes,
unlike the Sirt1 inhibitor EX527 (Fig. 2b). Sirt2 overexpression
increased 2-DG uptake by db/db mouse-derived primary hepa-
tocytes, but Sirt1 overexpression did not, and the Sirt2-induced
increase in 2-DG uptake was inhibited by nicotinamide (Fig. 2c
and Supplementary Fig. 3b). NMN increased the 2-DG uptake by
db/db mouse-derived primary hepatocytes, but this effect was lost
after Sirt2 knockdown, unlike Sirt1 knockdown (Fig. 2d). While
NMN treatment ameliorated glucose intolerance in obese HFD-
fed mice, Sirt2 knockdown partially negated the blood glucose-
lowering effects of NMN in a glucose tolerance test when endo-
genous insulin secretion was inhibited by somatostatin adminis-
tration (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 3c). In spite of the
functional redundancy between Sirt1 and Sirt221, Sirt1 and Sirt2
double knockdown revealed no difference in 2-DG uptake com-
pared with Sirt2 knockdown in lean mouse-derived hepatocytes
or in NMN-treated db/db mouse-derived hepatocytes (Fig. 2d, f).

 Furthermore, hepatic Sirt1 knockdown had no additional ameli-
oration of the NMN-dependent increase in glucose tolerance
compared with hepatic Sirt2 knockdown (Fig. 2e and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3c). These findings suggest that Sirt2 plays impor-
tant roles in NAD+-dependent regulation of HGU.
We then investigated the role of Sirt2 in HGU and glucose
homeostasis. Hepatic Sirt2 knockdown caused a slight increase in
the blood glucose level and clear hyperinsulinemia under ad
libitum feeding (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 3d, e). Increased
blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were also observed in the
glucose tolerance test (Fig. 2h, i). Hepatic 2-DG uptake
diminished with the glucose load, but the uptake by WAT and
the skeletal muscle was not different from that of the control
(Fig. 2j and Supplementary Fig. 3f). Meanwhile, liver-specific
Sirt2 overexpression by adenoviral vector in obese HFD-fed mice
lowered the blood glucose and plasma insulin levels under ad

blood glucose and plasma insulin levels also decreased in the
glucose tolerance test (Fig. 2l, m). There was no difference in
WAT and skeletal muscle glucose uptake, but hepatic 2-DG
uptake increased (Fig. 2n and Supplementary Fig. 3i). No clear
change in hepatic G6pc gene expression was observed with
hepatic Sirt2 knockdown or hepatic Sirt2 overexpression in obese
HFD-fed mice (Supplementary Fig. 3j, k). The gene expression of
Gck increased with hepatic Sirt2 knockdown despite the decrease
in HGU, whereas the opposite effects were observed with hepatic
Sirt2 overexpression (Supplementary Fig. 3j, k). These results
suggest that Sirt2 operates independently from Gck and G6pc
gene expressions to regulate HGU.
Sirt2 facilitates the dissociation of glucokinase and GKRP. To
determine how Sirt2 regulates HGU, we investigated the effects of
Sirt2 on the glucose-dependent dissociation of glucokinase and
GKRP. While glucokinase and GKRP were bound in primary
hepatocytes in low-glucose culture medium and dissociated under
high-glucose conditions, Sirt2 knockdown inhibited the glucoki-
nase−GKRP
dissociation
in
high-glucose
culture
medium
(Fig. 3a). In db/db mouse-derived primary hepatocytes, glucoki-
nase and GKRP did not dissociate under high-glucose conditions,
with Sirt2 overexpression restoring this dissociation (Fig. 3b).
Treatment of db/db mouse-derived primary hepatocytes with
NMN restored the glucokinase−GKRP binding dissociation under
high-glucose conditions, but this effect was lost with Sirt2
knockdown (Fig. 3c). Glucose administration induced glucoki-
nase−GKRP dissociation in the liver, but this dissociation was
inhibited by hepatic Sirt2 knockdown (Fig. 3d).
To determine whether there is a direct effect of Sirt2 on
glucokinase or GKRP, we investigated protein−protein interac-
tions using fluorescent Azami Green (hAG) and Ash tags. When
molecules possessing these tags bind directly to each other,
hAG is concentrated locally and becomes visible as fluorescent
foci. AG-Sirt2 was present in the cytoplasm in primary
hepatocytes. Fluorescent foci appeared in the cytoplasm in the
group transfected with both Sirt2 and GKRP, but no fluorescent
foci were observed in the Sirt2- and glucokinase-transfected
group (Fig. 3e). In HEK293 cells coexpressing Sirt2 and GKRP or
glucokinase, Sirt2 and GKRP co-immunoprecipitated, unlike
Sirt2 and glucokinase (Fig. 3f). In contrast, Sirt1 did not
co-immunoprecipitate GKRP (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The
Sirt2−GKRP co-immunoprecipitation remained unaltered by
the glucose concentration in the culture medium in primary
cultured
hepatocytes,
whereas
the
glucokinase−GKRP
co-immunoprecipitation was blocked under high-glucose condi-
tions (Fig. 3g). These results suggest that Sirt2 interacts directly
with GKRP to regulate the dissociation of glucokinase and GKRP.
Sirt2 deacetylates GKRP. GKRP was acetylated in HEK293 cells,
but the degree of acetylation was reduced by Sirt2 overexpression
(Fig. 4a). This GKRP acetylation-reducing effect of Sirt2 over-
expression was inhibited by nicotinamide and AGK2 but not by
EX527 or the class I and II histone deacetylase inhibitor tri-
chostatin A (Fig. 4a). GKPR acetylation in primary hepatocytes
was enhanced by Sirt2 knockdown but was unaffected by the
glucose concentration in the culture medium, as with NAD+
levels, even in the hepatocytes overexpressing GKRP (Fig. 4b and
Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). GKRP acetylation was enhanced in db/
db mouse-derived primary hepatocytes but was reduced by Sirt2
overexpression (Fig. 4c). NMN treatment also reduced GKRP
acetylation in db/db mouse-derived primary hepatocytes, and this
effect was blocked by Sirt2 knockdown (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, in
livers of obese HFD-fed mice, forced hepatic Sirt2 expression
using an adenoviral vector reduced GKRP acetylation (Fig. 4e).
These findings suggest that Sirt2 deacetylates GKRP in a NAD
+-dependent manner.
We evaluated hepatic Sirt2 activity by measuring deacetylation
of keratin 8, a known hepatic target protein of Sirt2-dependent
deacetylation23, in addition to GKRP deacetylation. Hepatic Sirt2
knockdown resulted in enhanced acetylation of both keratin 8
and GKRP in mouse liver (Fig. 4f). GKRP acetylation was
increased in the livers of obese HFD-fed mice but was reduced by
NMN, coincident with keratin 8 acetylation (Fig. 4g). The
acetylation of both Sirt2 and keratin 8 was unaffected by glucose
administration (Fig. 4h). While acetylation of both hepatic keratin
8 and GKRP was much weaker in lean mice than in obese HFD-
fed mice under ad libitum feeding, fasting diminished acetylation,
which then slightly increased 6 h after refeeding (Supplementary
Fig. 4d).
GKRP deacetylation facilitates glucokinase−GKRP dissocia-
tion. Next, we investigated the acetylation sites of GKRP.
DYKDDDDK-tagged GKRP expressed in HEK293 cells was
analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS). We identified K43, K126, K165, K235, K267,
K279, K312, and K327 as GKRP acetylation site candidates
(Supplementary Fig. 5a–h). A deacetylation-mimicking lysine
(K)-to-arginine (R) mutant and an acetylation-mimicking lysine-
to-glutamine (Q) mutant were created for each candidate to
determine the Sirt2-dependent deacetylation site. Only K126R
and K126Q were not deacetylated by Sirt2 (Fig. 5a, b). Further-
more, K126R mutant overexpression suppressed the GKRP
acetylation that was enhanced in db/db mouse-derived primary
hepatocytes, suggesting that K126 of GKRP is the site of the
acetylation in the hepatocytes of diabetic obese mice (Fig. 5c).
The K126R mutant behaved like wild-type GKRP in primary
hepatocytes, that is, binding to and dissociating from glucokinase

 (Fig. 5m, n) to a similar extent to Sirt2 knockdown and nicoti-
namide treatment. Transfection with either mutant gene did not
have any clear effect on Gck or G6pc gene expressions (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6a, b).
Hepatic Sirt2 knockdown diminished hepatic 2-DG uptake in
mice transduced with adenoviral vector encoding wild-type
GKRP, causing slightly impaired glucose tolerance and elevated
plasma insulin levels (Fig. 6a–c and Supplementary Fig. 7a).
K126R mutant transduction in hepatic Sirt2 knockdown mice
mitigated all of these conditions (Fig. 6a–c and Supplementary
Fig. 7a). In obese HFD-fed mice, intraperitoneal NMN increased
the plasma insulin value, improved glucose tolerance, and
increased hepatic 2-DG uptake. Hepatic K126Q overexpression
diminished these effects of NMN, although there was no
alteration in the plasma insulin-elevating effect (Fig. 6d–f and
Supplementary Fig. 7b). Hepatic Gck and G6pc gene expressions
were unaffected by transduction with K126R or K126Q mutant
(Supplementary Fig. 7c, d).
GKRP deacetylation improves HGU in obese diabetic mice.
Hepatic K126Q-overexpressing mice displayed elevated blood
glucose and plasma insulin values when fed ad libitum (Fig. 7a, b
and Supplementary Fig. 8a). No changes in hepatic NAD+ levels
or the gene expression of Gck and G6pc were observed, whereas
hepatic 2-DG uptake following a glucose load was reduced and
blood glucose and plasma insulin values were increased (Fig. 7c–e
and Supplementary Fig. 8b–d). Hepatic K126R overexpression in
obese HFD-fed mice did not alter the blood glucose value but
reduced the plasma insulin values, suggesting that it improved the
insulin sensitivity (Fig. 7f, g and Supplementary Fig. 8e). Their
hepatic 2-DG uptake was augmented, followed by lowered blood
glucose and plasma insulin values in the glucose tolerance test
(Fig. 7h–j and Supplementary Fig. 8f). There was no change in the
hepatic NAD+ levels and the gene expressions of Gck and G6pc
(Supplementary Fig. 8g, h). In db/db mice, blood glucose and
plasma insulin values diminished as a result of hepatic K126R
overexpression, under both ad libitum feeding and glucose tol-
erance test conditions (Fig. 7k–n). Hepatic 2-DG uptake in db/db
mice increased but no changes in hepatic NAD+ levels and the
gene expression of glucokinase and G6pc were observed as a result
of K126R overexpression (Fig. 7o and Supplementary Fig. 8i–k).
While wild-type GKRP overexpressed in the liver was acetylated,
that of K126R mutant was not acetylated in db/db mice (Fig. 7p).
These results suggest that K126 acetylation of GKRP has a sig-
nificant effect on HGU and glucose tolerance.
Discussion
Impaired HGU results in the postprandial hyperglycemia asso-
ciated with type 2 diabetes5,6, but its molecular mechanism is
unclear. We found that HGU impairment in obese diabetic mice
results in part from a decrease in hepatic NAD+-dependent Sirt2
activity and a defect in Sirt2-dependent deacetylation of K126 of
GKRP. NAD+ levels in the liver are decreased in obese diabetic
mice, as well as in the skeletal muscles, adipose tissues, and
pancreatic β cells16. NMN administration can restore the NAD+
levels in these organs, enhancing glucose tolerance through
increased insulin sensitivity in female mice and insulin secretion
in male mice16. Here, we confirmed that insulin secretion and
glucose tolerance were enhanced by NMN administration. In
addition, we found that the NMN-induced NAD+ content
increase led to enhanced glucose tolerance via an insulin-
independent increase in HGU, as well as an insulin-mediated
manner. Indeed, NMN administration reduced the blood glucose
value during glucose tolerance testing and increased hepatic 2-
DG uptake under a somatostatin-administered state during which
endogenous insulin secretion is inhibited. In primary hepatocytes,
NMN restored the Nampt knockdown-induced decrease in HGU
but could not restore the reduced HGU when NAD+ biosynthesis
from NMN was inhibited. This shows that the HGU-enhancing
effect of NMN depends on hepatocyte NAD+ content.
Impaired 2-DG uptake in db/db mouse-derived hepatocytes was
mitigated by NMN, but this effect was lost after Sirt2 knockdown,
indicating the involvement of Sirt2 in hepatic NAD+-dependent
regulation of HGU. In lean mouse-derived hepatocytes and lean
mouse livers, Sirt2 knockdown reduced 2-DG uptake, suggesting
that Sirt2 is essential for maintaining physiological HGU and
postprandial glucose homeostasis. In contrast, overexpression of
Sirt2 increased hepatic 2-DG uptake in db/db mouse-derived
hepatocytes and HFD-fed mouse livers, indicating the importance
of Sirt2 in the glucose uptake impairment found in obese diabetic
livers. In our study, the acetylation of keratin 8, which is deace-
tylated by Sirt2, was enhanced in the liver of HFD-fed mice, which
is in line with previous reports that its acetylation is enhanced in
obese diabetic leptin-deficient ob/ob mice23. However, keratin 8
acetylation remained unchanged after glucose administration, and
its change after refeeding in lean mice remained minimal. If the
hepatic levels of NAD+ and of keratin 8 and GKRP deacetylation
reflect hepatic Sirt2 activity, it is plausible that a decrease in Sirt2
activity in the obese diabetic livers results in compromised reg-
ulation of HGU and glucokinase translocation by postprandial
hyperglycemia. While the function of Sirt1 partially overlaps that of
Sirt2, neither Sirt1 knockdown in lean mouse-derived hepatocytes
nor its overexpression in db/db mouse-derived hepatocytes affected
2-DG uptake. Indeed, Sirt1 did not bind to GKRP, whereas Sirt2
directly bound to GKRP to regulate HGU.
Because HGU is regulated by both glucose and insulin4, the
insulin-independent glucose tolerance-enhancing effect of NAD+
/Sirt2 may be in part responsible for the glucose-dependent
regulation of HGU, which also involves glucokinase and GKRP.
In studies using co-immunoprecipitation and hAG/Ash tags,
GKRP was suggested to be the direct target protein of Sirt2. We
then found that Sirt2 knockdown and overexpression resulted in
increased and decreased GKRP acetylation, respectively, in

 primary hepatocytes, suggesting that Sirt2 deacetylates GKRP.
Hepatic Gck gene expression was enhanced after hepatic Sirt2
knockdown and was reduced after hepatic Sirt2 overexpression.
These changes might result in underestimation of the effects of
Sirt2 on HGU regulation. Because Sirt2 knockdown had no effect
on the Gck gene expression in primary hepatocytes, these Gck
gene expression changes under Sirt2 knockdown and over-
expression conditions may be caused by the change in the plasma
insulin levels, which correlated with insulin sensitivity.

 GKRP acetylation is alleviated in db/db mouse-derived hepato-
cytes and liver with hepatic K126R overexpression. This indicates
that K126 undergoes enhanced acetylation following decreased
Sirt2 activity in obese diabetic liver. GKRP acetylation still
showed little change after glucose administration and a minimal
increase after refeeding in lean mice, but Sirt2 knockdown
resulted in elevated GKRP acetylation in lean mice. These find-
ings reveal that Sirt2 activity suffices to deacetylate GKRP in the
livers of lean mice, even under fasting and refeeding conditions.
GKRP acetylation involves not only deacetylase, but also acetyl-
transferase. The detailed mechanism underlying the slight change
in GKRP acetylation after refeeding is unclear but it may involve
acetyltransferase. A study in HeLa cells identified p300 as the
acetyltransferase responsible for K5 acetylation of GKRP24, but
further investigation is required to identify the mechanism of
K126 acetylation found in our study.
Glucokinase is bound to GKRP under low-glucose conditions,
resulting in its inactivation. Glucose induces a structural rear-
rangement of glucokinase, which is followed by glucokinase
−GKRP dissociation and glucokinase activation25. Indeed, co-
immunoprecipitation of glucokinase and GKRP decreased under
high-glucose conditions in lean mouse-derived hepatocytes. Sirt2
appears to function as a NAD+-dependent rheostat that deter-
mines the extent of the interaction between GK and GKRP via
GKRP deacetylation under a high-glucose condition. Actually,
acetylation-mimicking GKRP mutant (K126Q) could not dis-
sociate from glucokinase under high-glucose conditions. How-
ever, as deacetylation-mimicking GKRP mutant (K126R) can
bind to glucokinase under high-glucose conditions, deacetylation
of GKRP itself did not induce its dissociation from glucokinase.
We also found that Sirt2 binds to GKRP and that this association
in lean mouse-derived hepatocytes was unaffected by glucose
levels in the cell medium. These findings may indicate that Sirt2
binds to and deacetylates GKRP to prevent GKRP from binding
to and inhibiting glucokinase in lean mouse liver, where NAD+
levels are sufficient for Sirt2 to deacetylate GKRP even under
high-glucose conditions; conversely, compromised Sirt2 activity
caused by NAD+ reduction in obese-mouse liver fails to deace-
tylate GKRP, resulting in GKRP binding to and inhibiting glu-
cokinase. Elucidation of how K126 acetylation prevents the
glucose-dependent glucokinase−GKRP dissociation, such as via
structural changes in their complex, remains a future challenge.
In vivo studies indicate that Sirt2-dependent GKRP K126
deacetylation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HGU
and glucose tolerance impairments in obese diabetic livers.
Because an acetylation-mimicking mutation of GKRP (K126Q)
inhibited glucose-dependent glucokinase−GKRP dissociation and
diminished 2-DG uptake in mouse-derived hepatocytes, hepatic
acetylation-mimicking GKRP (K126Q)-expressing mice displayed
reduced hepatic 2-DG uptake and impaired glucose tolerance and
resistance to NMN-dependent amelioration of the impeded
hepatic 2-DG uptake and glucose intolerance in obese HFD-fed
mice. On the other hand, because the glucose-dependent gluco-
kinase−GKRP dissociation was restored and 2-DG uptake was
augmented by deacetylation-mimicking GKRP mutant (K126R)
overexpression
in
db/db
mouse-derived
hepatocytes,
deacetylation-mimicking GKRP (K126R) transduction in the
livers of HFD-fed mice and db/db mice increased hepatic 2-DG
uptake and improved glucose tolerance and insulin resistance,
even though their hepatic NAD+ levels were unaffected. Fur-
thermore, hepatic K126R transduction overcame hepatic Sirt2
knockdown-induced impaired hepatic 2-DG uptake and glucose
intolerance.
This study revealed that NAD+ /Sirt2 are important in HGU
regulation and that Sirt2 permits glucose-dependent dissociation
of glucokinase from GKRP by deacetylating K126 of GKRP. In
HFD-fed obese diabetic mice and db/db mice, Sirt2 activity
diminishes with the decrease in hepatic NAD+ content, which
enhances GKRP acetylation and impairs HGU. Moreover, we
found that K126 deacetylation of GKRP alleviates the impaired
glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in obese diabetic HFD-
fed mice and db/db mice. These findings suggest that NAD
+/Sirt2-dependent
GKRP
deacetylation
regulation
plays
an
important role in HGU control and that this regulation is a novel
therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes and obesity and is respon-
sible for HGU impairment.
Methods
Cell culture. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 8–12-week-old male C57BL/
6J or db/db mice and cultured using a previously described method26. The liver
from these anesthetized mice was perfused at a rate of 4.5 ml/min for the first 3 min
with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Wako, Saitama, Japan) containing 10
mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) and then for 17 min with HBSS containing collagenase
type I (0.3 mg/ml) (Worthington, Lakewood, NY) and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
Complete-EDTA free (one tablet per 50 ml) (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Hepato-
cytes from C57BL/6J were purified by density gradient centrifugation with Percoll
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO), seeded at a density of 5.0×104 cells/cm2 and incubated in
William’s Medium E (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS). For Sirt1–7 and Nampt in vitro knockdown models,
hepatocytes were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life
Technologies). In the in vitro 2-DG uptake assay, after primary hepatocytes were
cultured in high-glucose FBS-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM)
(Wako) with Sirt activator NMN (100 μM) (Sigma), Nmnat inhibitor gallotannin
(100 μM) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), nicotinamide (20 μM)
(Sigma), Ex-527 (10 μM) (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO), or AGK2 (10 μM)
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 6 h, hepatocytes were incubated in PBS containing
2-DG (25 mM) (Sigma) for 3 min. In immunoprecipitation and immunoblot ana-
lysis of glucokinase−GKRP binding and the acetylated GKRP level, hepatocytes
were incubated in FBS-free DMEM with low (5 mM) or high (25 mM) glucose
concentrations with NMN (100 μM) or nicotinamide (20 μM) for 6 h. HEK 293 cells,

 human embryonic kidney cells, were obtained from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, CA).
HEK 293 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and transfected with each
plasmid for 24 h using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI).
HEK 293 cells were stimulated with NAM (20 μM), Ex-527 (10 μM), AGK2 (10 μM),
and TSA (1 μM) for 6 h. The cell lines were regularly tested for mycoplasma
contamination.
Biochemical analysis. NAD+ and 2-DG levels in primary hepatocytes and tissue
samples were measured using a NAD/NADH quantification kit (BioVision,
Mountain View, CA) and a 2-DG Uptake Measurement Kit (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo,
Japan), respectively.
Animals. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee
of Kanazawa University and were performed according to the Animal Ethics
Committee’s guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals at Kanazawa
University. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J and db/db mice were obtained from
Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan) and maintained in a temperature-controlled envir-
onment with a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. An HFD
(61% of energy from fat) (D12492; Research Diet, New Brunswick, NJ) was fed to
8-week-old mice for 12 weeks. In NMN experiments, mice were intraperitoneally
injected with NMN (500 mg/kg body weight) 6 h before each analysis. Liver-
specific knockdown mice were generated by siRNA as described previously27. For
the in vivo 2-DG uptake assay, except in hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic clamp
experiments, 2-DG (200 μmol/kg) was injected into the tail vein 10 min after
glucose administration (2 g/kg body weight for fasted lean mice; 1 g/kg body weight
for fasted HFD mice). Liver, epididymal WAT, and soleus muscle samples were
collected 10 min after 2-DG injection. For in vivo immunoprecipitation and
immunoblot analysis of the GK−GKRP binding assay, livers were obtained from
mice 30 min after glucose administration (4 g/kg) after 16-h fasting. Cages of mice
were allocated to experimental groups by random draw. The investigator was not
blinded to the group allocation.
Glucose tolerance testing. For intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, mice were
intraperitoneally administered 1 g/kg body weight glucose for HFD-fed mice and 2
g/kg body weight glucose for NC-fed mice, with or without continuous intravenous
administration of somatostatin (3 μg/kg/min) (Sigma) through a jugular catheter
from 1 h before glucose administration. Blood glucose levels were measured using a
GLUCOCARD G+ Meter (Arkray, Kyoto, Japan) and a commercial colorimetric
kit (Wako). Plasma insulin levels were measured using a Mouse Insulin ELISA Kit
(Shibayagi, Gunma, Japan).
Hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic clamping. Hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic
clamp studies were performed 4–7 days after canalization as described previously
with modifications28. Hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic clamping was performed in
awake and unrestrained overnight-fasted mice. During the clamp study, insulin
(1.25 mU/kg/min) (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) and somatostatin (3 μg/kg/min)
were infused through the jugular catheter with a variable amount of 40% glucose
solution to maintain the blood glucose level at 280 ± 30 mg/dl. After 50 min, 2-DG
(200 μmol/kg) was intravenously administered for 1 min and, 10 min after 2-DG
administration, liver, WAT, and soleus muscle samples were obtained for a 2-DG
uptake assay.
Quantitative PCR. Quantitative PCR was performed as previously described29.
Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue or cell samples using the SV Total
RNA Isolation System (Promega). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with the
PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan). Quantitative PCR was
performed by using the SYBR Select Master Mix kit (Life Technologies) with 36B4
as the control gene. The primer sequences used in this study are available upon
request (36B4, Gck [which encodes glucokinase] and G6pc [which encodes
G6Pase]).
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Western blotting was performed as
previously described30. Liver tissues and cultured cells were homogenized in ice-
cold CelLytic MT Cell Lysis Reagent (Sigma) with protease inhibitors. Immuno-
precipitation was performed using Acetylated K antibodies conjugated to Dyna-
beads Protein G (Life Technologies) or Flag tag antibody conjugated-magnetic
beads. The antibodies used in the immunoprecipitation of Flag tag, acetylated K of
GKRP, and acetylated K of keratin 8 were anti-DYKDDDDK tag magnetic beads
(1E6, 10 μl/mg protein; Wako), anti-AcK (#9441, 0.2 μl/mg protein; Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA), and anti-AcK (ab21623, 0.2 μl/mg protein; Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), respectively. The following antibodies were obtained for

Bank, Iowa City, IA). Immunoblot images were quantified by densitometry on an
LAS-3000 Imager (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Uncropped images of representative
immunoblots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9.
Adenovirus vectors. Adenovirus vectors (Flag-tagged Sirt2, HA-tagged Sirt2,
Flag-tagged glucokinase, HA-tagged glucokinase, glucokinase, Flag-tagged GKRP,
Flag-tagged K126R GKRP, Flag-tagged K126Q GKRP, and U6) were constructed
by an Adenovirus Dual Expression Kit (Takara Bio). Adenovirus vector encoding
Flag-tagged Sirt1 was provided by T Kitamura (Gunma University). Isolated mouse
hepatocytes and mice were used for each experiment 24 h and 3–4 days after
adenovirus transfection, respectively. Mice received adenoviruses (5.0×108 plaque-
forming units) into the tail vein.
Protein−protein interaction assay. The interaction between Sirt2 and GKRP or
glucokinase was analyzed by a fluorescent-based system for detecting protein
−protein interactions (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), which detects protein−protein
interactions as fluorescent foci. Hepatocytes were transfected with phAG-tagged
Sirt2, GKRP, or glucokinase and pAsh-tagged Sirt2, GKRP, or glucokinase vectors
using Lipofectamine 3000 Reagent (Life Technologies). The intracellular fluor-
escent foci were observed using a fluorescence microscope (FSX100; Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan).
Mass spectrometry analysis of GKRP. Whole-cell lysates of HEK293 cells
transfected with Flag-tagged GKRP were immunoprecipitated by an anti-
DYKDDDDK tag antibody (Wako). The fusion protein was eluted by
DYKDDDDK Peptide (Wako) and re-immunoprecipitated by anti-AcK (Cell
Signaling Technology). The immunoprecipitate was resolved on a 4–12% gradient
SDS-PAGE gel and the protein band was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis
by MS Bioworks (Ann Arbor, MI). For mass spectrometry analysis of the com-
pounds in this article, see Supplementary Figure 5.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean.
Statistical methods were not used to determine sample size before the experiment,
which was instead based on preliminary data and previous publications. Animals
were excluded from experiments if they showed any sign of sickness. Variance
homogeneity was examined using Levene’s test for multiple groups or an F-test for
two groups. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t-test for the
comparison of two groups and one-way ANOVA with the Fisher’s PLSD post-hoc
test for the comparison of several groups. Differences were considered significant at
P < 0.05.
