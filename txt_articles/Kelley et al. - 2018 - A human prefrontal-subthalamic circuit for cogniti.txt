The subthalamic nucleus is a key site controlling motor function in humans. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus can
improve movements in patients with Parkinson’s disease; however, for unclear reasons, it can also have cognitive effects. Here, we
show that the human subthalamic nucleus is monosynaptically connected with cognitive brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex.
Single neurons and field potentials in the subthalamic nucleus are modulated during cognitive processing and are coherent with
4-Hz oscillations in medial prefrontal cortex. These data predict that low-frequency deep brain stimulation may alleviate cognitive
deficits in Parkinson’s disease patients. In line with this idea, we found that novel 4-Hz deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic
nucleus improved cognitive performance. These data support a role for the human hyperdirect pathway in cognitive control, which
could have relevance for brain-stimulation therapies aimed at cognitive symptoms of human brain disease.

Introduction
The human subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a key site of
functional convergence from motor circuits (Alexander
and Crutcher, 1990). As a result, the STN is a powerful
therapeutic
target
for
movement
disorders
such
as
Parkinson’s disease (Limousin et al., 1998; Follett, 2004).
STN
modulation
with
high-frequency
deep
brain
stimulation
(DBS)
improves motor
function
(Limousin
et al., 1998; Follett et al., 2010). In addition to input
from indirect basal ganglia pathways, the STN is thought
to receive fast monosynaptic projections directly from
motor areas of the frontal cortex via a ‘hyperdirect’ path-
way (Nambu et al., 2002). Existence of this pathway
has been demonstrated in non-human primates and ro-
dents (Haynes and Haber, 2013; Averbeck et al., 2014).

 STN-DBS in humans has been proposed to involve these
hyperdirect projections (Gradinaru et al., 2009; Chiken
and Nambu, 2014). However, hyperdirect projections
from the frontal cortex to the STN have never been
demonstrated in human intracranial recordings.
STN-DBS affects cognitive function (Heo et al., 2008;
Benabid et al., 2009; Okun et al., 2009). Multiple lines
of evidence suggest that the STN is critically involved in
inhibiting premature responses and regulation decision
thresholds,
including
data
from
rats
(Baunez
and
Robbins,
1997),
non-human
primates
(Isoda
and
Hikosaka, 2008) and humans (Aron and Poldrack, 2006;
Frank, 2006; Aron et al., 2007; Jahfari et al., 2012;
Zaghloul et al., 2012; Frank et al., 2015). These studies
have linked midfrontal EEG to STN activity (Cavanagh
et al., 2011; Zavala et al., 2014; Frank et al., 2015) and
cognitive control (Aron et al., 2007; Voon and Fox, 2007;
Jahfari et al., 2012; Herz et al., 2016, 2017). Non-human
primate studies have shown that the STN receives conver-
gent hyperdirect input from cognitive frontal cortical areas
such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Haynes and Haber,
2013; Averbeck et al., 2014; Alkemade et al., 2015).
STN local field potentials (LFPs) can have low-frequency
coherence with prefrontal areas in delta and theta bands
between 1 and 8 Hz (Zavala et al., 2014). These data lead
to the hypothesis that human hyperdirect low-frequency
interactions between PFC and STN support cognitive
control.
We tested this hypothesis via a novel combination of
human neuroscience methods to directly measure PFC-
STN connectivity in human patients undergoing neurosur-
gical treatment. In these patients, we demonstrate that
lateral and medial areas of PFC are functionally connected
with the STN. We probed PFC and STN activity in human
neurosurgical
patients
using
an
interval-timing
task.
Interval
timing
is
reliably
disrupted
in
patients
with
Parkinson’s disease and involves executive functions such
as working memory for temporal rules as well as attention
to the passage of time (Parker et al., 2013, 2015; Kim
et al., 2017). We found that 4-Hz PFC oscillations interact
with STN LFPs and single neurons during interval timing.
Furthermore, we found that 4-Hz STN-DBS improved
interval timing performance. Together, these data suggest
the involvement of a hyperdirect fronto-basal ganglia path-
way in cognitive functions in humans.
Materials and methods
Participants
Patients from the UIHC Neurology and Neurosurgery clinic
participated under procedures approved by the University of
Iowa’s Institutional Review Board. In total, data from 13 pa-
tients with Parkinson’s disease undergoing STN-DBS implant-
ation were included: five patients for intraoperative electrical
stimulation
tract-tracing
(ESTT)
to
map
frontal-STN
connectivity and 10 patients with intraoperative single-unit
recordings, STN LFPs, and EEG activity from midfrontal elec-
trodes (Supplementary Tables 2–4). Ten separate STN-DBS
patients were included in EEG recordings during interval
timing as STN-DBS parameters were changed; these patients
were stable on DBS settings and levodopa for at least 1 month
and were 43 months out from DBS implantation. In addition,
three patients undergoing surgical treatment of medically in-
tractable
epilepsy
with
medial
PFC
electrocorticography
(ECoG) coverage were included in this study; two for electrical
stimulation-functional MRI and one for medial PFC ECoG
recording during interval timing. All patients completed an
extensive pre-surgical assessment, which included a detailed
neurological examination, structural MRI, and neuropsycho-
logical evaluations that confirmed normal speech and language
functions. ECoG patients had undergone WADA testing as
well as had additional MRI, SPECT, and PET scans according
to procedures described in detail previously (Kingyon et al.,
2015).
Bidirectional electrical stimulation
tract-tracing
Once the DBS and subdural frontal ECoG strip electrodes
were positioned over lateral PFC (specifically middle frontal
gyrus) on both sides of the brain, bipolar constant voltage
stimulation of two DBS contacts spanning dorsal STN was
performed at 2.5, 5, and 10 V using single charged balanced
400-ms pulses with a fixed interstimulus interval of 1 s. A sub-
galeal strip electrode placed at the vertex served as a reference.
All voltages are plotted with negative polarity as down. Multi-
channel continuous time series were digitized using Tucker-
Davis Technology (TDT) RZ-2 acquisition system and stored
for offline analysis. Trials were broken down to 1.5-s epochs
constituting �0.5 s to + 1 s relative to the electrical stimulus.
Evoked potentials were calculated across trials for each contact
and stimulation voltage. Significant early peak latencies were
determined by false discovery rate-corrected repeated measures
two-way t-test of voltages in 1 ms post-stimulation time bins
versus mean baseline voltage (�100 to �1 ms from stimula-
tion). Knowledge of the exact location of the surgical burr
hole, direction of the strip (parallel to the superior sagittal
sinus) and length the strip was slid posteriorly from the burr
hole was accomplished by a combination of lateral fluoros-
copy, intraoperative video, and direct observation of the at-
tending neurosurgeon. This allowed for localization of the four
electrode
contacts
on
lateral
PFC
and
motor
cortex
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
Human interval timing task
Interval timing was investigated in patients with Parkinson’s
disease undergoing STN-DBS implantation or with existing
STN-DBS according to methods described in detail previously
with a few modifications (Parker et al., 2015). To be max-
imally compatible with the operating room, auditory stimuli
were used. Briefly, trials started with an instructional cue (a
recorded voice stating the word ‘three’ or ‘twelve’) followed 1 s
later by an 8-kHz tone (‘starting cue’) indicating the start of
the interval. Patients made responses by pressing a button on a
button-box or a space bar on a keyboard using the hand

 ipsilateral to the STN recording electrode. The first response
after the start of the interval was recorded and a 3-s intertrial
interval preceded the next trial. In the operating room, each
block consisted of 40 trials. Participants performed a full block
of practice trials in the operating room prior to the real task.
An identical task was performed with STN-DBS and mid-
frontal EEG. One block of 40 trials was performed at each
DBS setting [high frequency (HF)-DBS and 4-Hz DBS]. Trials
were presented in pseudorandom order. Participants were
asked not to count in their head during the task. At least
30 min elapsed between DBS setting changes and task perform-
ance (Cooper et al., 2013). All testing outside the operating
room was done while patients took levodopa and other medi-
cations as usual. Levodopa does not reliably affect interval
timing performance or midfrontal delta/theta rhythms (Parker
et al., 2015). Only seven patients completed blocks with 4-Hz
DBS stimulation, 10 patients completed the other blocks. No
patients or blocks were excluded. All STN-DBS patients were
stable on medications and DBS for at least 1 month, and all
had implants at least 3 months prior to testing. Response times
were analysed using a linear mixed-effects model using reac-
tion time as the dependent variable, DBS setting (typical HF-
DBS, 4 Hz, or off) and interval (FI3 versus FI12) as fixed ef-
fects, and patients as random effects.
Human electrocorticography
Intracortical ECoG electrodes were referenced to an extracra-
nial subgaleal electrode near the vertex. The ECoG signals
were band-pass filtered (1.6–1000 Hz, �12 dB/octave anti-
aliasing filter) and then digitized with a sampling frequency
of 2034.5 Hz. Recordings from grid electrodes were inspected
to ensure they were not contaminated by epileptiform activity
or artefact and power-line noise was removed using an adap-
tive notch-filtering procedure. Patients with medial prefrontal
coverage had depth electrodes that used �5 mm centre-to-
centre spacing. The exact position of the recording arrays dif-
fered somewhat between patients as placement was based on
patient-specific clinical considerations. In these patients, cover-
age included significant portions of medial prefrontal cortex.
The electrodes remained in place during a 14-day hospital stay
during which the patients underwent continuous video-EEG
monitoring.
EEG
monitoring
confirmed
that
the
cortical
areas pertinent to this study did not show abnormal interictal
activity. None of these areas were part of the epileptogenic
focus and its eventual resection. Experiments were conducted
in a specially designed and electromagnetically-shielded private
patient suite. Patients did not incur any additional medical or
surgical risks by participating in this study.
Human electrical stimulation-
functional MRI
All neurosurgical patients had detailed 3 T structural MRIs.
These were used for indirect targeting of STN, diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI), and electrode reconstruction. The recon-
struction of the intracranial electrode contacts was performed
using a combination of high-resolution digital photographs,
and
thin-cut
pre-
and
post-implantation
structural
MRI
(1.0 � 1.0 � 1.0 mm
voxel
size)
and
CT
(0.45 � 0.45
� 1.0 mm voxel size) scans. Pre- and post-implantation CTs
and MRIs were co-registered using a 3D rigid-fusion algorithm
implemented in FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool
(Jenkinson et al., 2002). Coordinates for each electrode ob-
tained from post-implantation MRI volumes were transferred
to pre-implantation MRI volumes. The location of every con-
tact relative to visible surrounding brain structures was com-
pared in both pre- and post-implantation MRI volumes. The
resultant electrode locations were then mapped to a 3D cor-
tical surface rendering. The estimated overall error in electrode
localization using these techniques does not exceed 2 mm
based on visual inspection. Electrical stimulation-functional
MRI was performed in two patients with medial PFC ECoG
electrode coverage. Briefly, T2*-weighted images (gradient
echo-EPI) were acquired while electrical stimulus was delivered
to the intracranial contacts. The stimulation was in bipolar
fashion using adjacent depth electrode contacts. We used a
3 T MRI scanner (Siemens Trio). Charge-balanced square
waves at 100 Hz and 9 mA current were delivered for mid-
cingulate contacts. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
images were realigned, smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of
6 mm full-width at half-maximum, and analysed using a gen-
eral linear model according to Oya et al. (2017).
EEG recording and analysis
In the operating room, a highly limited montage was used to
acquire data with midfrontal EEG (�AFz/Fz leads, depending
on sterile field, frame placement, and other hardware, as well
as �C3, �C4, and mastoids). For STN-DBS with EEG, record-
ing and analysis was similar to methods described in detail
previously (Narayanan et al., 2013a; Parker et al., 2015).
EEG was recorded on a Biopac system with a sampling rate
of 500 Hz. EEG was recorded from a 64-channel system.
Impedance of all electrodes was below 5 k�. Continuous
data were parsed into 16-s epochs (�2 to 14 s following the
cue) and re-referenced to the mathematical average of the two
mastoid channels, yielding a total of 62 scalp EEG channels.
Eye blinks and horizontal eye movements were removed by
hand using independent component analysis and the EEGLab
MATLAB toolbox (Delorme and Makeig, 2004).
Subthalamic nucleus recording
STN-DBS implantation is staged such that bilateral DBS elec-
trodes are implanted sequentially during a single stereotactic
procedure. Prior to surgery, midfrontal and reference EEG
electrodes are placed. We elected to compare STN activity to
midfrontal EEG electrodes because (i) it was technically more
feasible than inserting an ECoG strip though the DBS burr
hole as described above; and (ii) delta/theta oscillations from
midfrontal EEG electrodes in patients with Parkinson’s disease
have been well described by our group and others (Narayanan
et al., 2013a; Cavanagh and Frank, 2014; Parker et al., 2015;
Chen et al., 2016). Patients underwent standard bilateral DBS
implantation via indirect framed stereotactic targeting of the
STN refined by multielectrode recordings from 0.4 to 0.8 m�
tungsten electrodes (Alpha-Omega). Three to five microelec-
trode recording tracks were used, consisting of anterior,
middle, and posterior microelectrode recording trajectories at
�74� from the horizontal separated by 2 mm centre-to-centre.

 microelectrode recording. All interval timing task stimuli were
auditory and were delivered via headphones. Behavioural and
neurophysiological data were acquired simultaneously using a
Tucker-Davis Technologies multi-channel system. Microelec-
trode recording was sampled at 24 kHz, amplified, and filtered
for single neurons (1–8 kHz) and STN LFPs (5200 Hz).
Mastoid and subgaleal electrodes were used as references.
Because microelectrode recording recordings are clinically ne-
cessary, patients were not exposed to extra electrode penetra-
tions.
With
our
intraoperative
team,
these
experiments
typically prolonged DBS surgery by 510 min/task, including
set-up time. Patients did receive pain relief and sedative medi-
cations in the operating room; these were short-acting agents
(e.g. remifentanil, dexmedetomidine), which were stopped
41 h prior to microelectrode recording in all 10 patients,
allowing patients to be maximally awake for necessary clinical
testing and participation in research. All electrodes were loca-
lized in the STN region by mapping individual intraoperative
stereotactic coordinates to MNI space (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Neurophysiological analyses
Raw voltage from STN microelectrode recording was digitized
at 24 kHz and filtered at 5200 Hz for LFP and 0.3–8 kHz for
neurons. Spike detection was performed by thresholding using
a median absolute deviation of 4. Spikes were pre-sorted using
unsupervised wavelet-based clustering and then sorted manu-
ally using principal component analyses (PCA) in Plexon’s off-
line
sorter
according
to
procedures
outlined
at
length
previously (Laubach et al., 2015; Parker et al., 2015). Spike
activity was analysed for all cells that fired at rates above
0.1 Hz. PCA and waveform shape were used for spike sorting.
Single units were identified as having (i) consistent waveform
shape; (ii) separable clusters in PCA space; and (iii) a consist-
ent refractory period of at least 2 ms in interspike interval
histograms. Significant cue- and response-related modulation
was defined as neurons with a significant difference in mean
firing-rate 1 s before and after events via a paired t-test. We
defined time-related ramping activity as firing rate that pro-
gressed linearly over the interval according to the formula:
y ¼ at þ c
ð1Þ
where y is firing rate, t is the time in seconds, and a is the
slope.
Time-frequency and neuronal
analyses
Time-frequency calculations were computed using custom-writ-
ten MATLAB routines according to the methods described at
length previously (Cavanagh et al., 2009). Time-frequency
measures were computed by multiplying the fast-Fourier trans-
formed (FFT) power spectrum of LFP data with the FFT power
spectrum of a set of complex Morlet wavelets [defined as a
Gaussian-windowed complex sine wave: ei2�tf e� t2
2x�2, where t is
time, f is frequency (which increased from 1 to 50 Hz in 50
logarithmically spaced steps), and defines the width (or ‘cycles’)
of each frequency band, set according to 4/[2�f], and taking the
inverse FFT. The end result of this process is identical to time-
domain signal convolution, and it resulted in: (i) estimates of
instantaneous power (the magnitude of the analytic signal),
defined as Z[t] {power time series: p(t) = real[z(t)]2 + imag
[z(t)]2}; and (ii) phase (the phase angle) defined as = arctan
(imag[z(t)]/real[z(t)]). Each epoch was then cut in length sur-
rounding the event of interest (�1500 to + 2000 ms around the
event). Power was normalized by conversion to a decibel (dB)
scale {10 � log10[power(t)/power(baseline)]} from a prestimu-
lus baseline of �500 to �300 ms, allowing a direct comparison
of effects across frequency bands. To quantify time-frequency
components of interactions between individual spikes and the
field potential, we applied field-field coherence and spike-field
coherence analysis using the Neurospec toolbox (Rosenberg
et al., 1989; Narayanan et al., 2013a; Parker et al., 2014), in
which multivariate Fourier analysis was used to extract phase-
locking among spike trains and LFPs. Phase-locking coherence
values varied from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no coherence and
1 indicates perfect coherence. To compare across neurons with
different distributions, all phase-locking values were divided by
the 95% confidence for each interval, so that 1 indicates a
P 5 0.05. To examine how DBS affected medial PFC, we ana-
lysed a region of interest of midfrontal EEG contacts. Our hy-
pothesis related to low-frequency PFC-STN connectivity was
shaped by extensive prior work pertaining to cue-triggered
delta rhythms at 1–4 Hz 300–500ms after cue onset at mid-
frontal region of interest (Ridderinkhof et al., 2004; Narayanan
et al., 2013a; Cavanagh and Frank, 2014; Parker et al., 2014,
2015, 2017). Notably, we did not observe any effects of DBS
outside this region. As in our behavioural analyses, we used a
linear mixed-effects model in which the dependent variable was
response times, fixed effects were mean cue-triggered midfrontal
power (1–4 Hz, 300–500 ms after cue onset) and DBS setting,
and random effects were electrode location and patients. For
trial-by-trial analyses of midfrontal power on response time
(RT), we also used a linear mixed-effects model [RT � Power
� DBS + (1 | Subject); Supplementary Table 5].
Granger causality
Raw LFPs recorded at midfrontal EEG sites and STN were
downsampled to 200 Hz and a 59–61 Hz Butterworth notch
filter was applied to remove line noise (Barrett et al., 2012).
We selected a model order of 100 ms and 200 ms sliding-time
segments (six segments per 12-s interval-timing trial) for sub-
sequent analysis to maximize the resolution of low-frequency
Granger prediction. A model order of 500 ms contains 51
cycle of a 5 2 Hz oscillation, allowing increased frequency
specificity of Granger prediction. Because larger model order
increases the risk of non-stationarity in time-series data, we
subtracted single-patient event-related potentials from time-
series segments, detrended, and z-scored all modelled data.
Corrected time-series segments were submitted to KPSS unit
root testing using MVGC Toolbox routines to determine
single-trial KPSS test statistics. Statistical testing of stationarity
was performed by compared single-trial KPSS test statistics to
a
non-stationarity
critical
value
computed
at
P = 0.05.
Significant Granger causality during 12-s interval timing was
assessed using Granger’s F-test routines in MVGC Toolbox at
P = 0.05. Inputs were F-statistics from grand-averaged time
segments for directed connectivity between middle frontal
cortex (MFC) and STN in experimental and time-shuffled
data.

 functions for the spectral factorization of autoregression re-
siduals. Spectral pairwise Granger prediction was subsequently
calculated by inverse-Fourier transformation of spectral factor-
ization outputs, resulting in time-frequency domain connectiv-
ity estimates (Barnett and Seth, 2014; Cohen, 2014).
Results
Hyperdirect connections between frontal cortex and the
STN have not been previously established in humans, al-
though indirect techniques such as DTI and functional
brain imaging have described frontal-STN connectivity
(Brunenberg
et
al.,
2012;
Haynes
and
Haber,
2013;
Averbeck
et
al.,
2014).
We
used
ESTT
experiments
during
DBS
implantation
surgery
to
investigate
STN
connectivity. This technique involves single-pulse brain
stimulation and recording of evoked responses in function-
ally-connected sites in PFC (Greenlee et al., 2004). We per-
formed STN stimulation via stereotactically-implanted DBS
electrodes and recorded evoked responses from subdural
ECoG electrodes located over primary motor cortex and
the middle frontal gyrus of lateral PFC (Fig. 1A, B and
Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). STN stimulation evoked
short-latency lateral PFC and motor cortical responses
(�12 ms), consistent with hyperdirect lateral PFC–STN
functional connectivity (Fig. 1B and C; P 5 0.01, see also
Supplementary Table 1). PFC ECoG sites are �9 cm away
from the STN, and cortical white matter conducts at �7–
10 m/s; latencies between 9–13 ms might be expected if
STN current depolarized and backfired axons of PFC neu-
rons, resulting in antidromic stimulation (Swadlow and
Waxman, 1976; Mathai and Smith, 2011). Cortical re-
sponses were ipsilateral, stimulation voltage-dependent,
and observed in 5/5 patients with 10 V STN stimulation
(Fig. 1C, Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Tables
1–3). In line with prior studies in non-human primates,
brain imaging studies in humans, and models of hyperdir-
ect function (Nambu et al., 2002; Haynes and Haber,
2013; Averbeck et al., 2014; Alkemade et al., 2015),
these results are consistent with monosynaptic projections
from the lateral PFC and motor cortex to the STN in
humans.
DBS implantation tracks for clinically-indicated neurosur-
gical procedures are proximate to lateral PFC sites in
middle frontal gyrus. However, these tracks are distant
from medial areas of PFC (medial PFC) such as anterior
cingulate that are critically involved in cognitive control.
Consequently, it is difficult to record from medial PFC
with
ESTT
while
stimulating
the
STN
in
humans
(Ridderinkhof et al., 2004). On rare occasions, epilepsy
patients have depth electrode arrays implanted in medial
PFC as part of epilepsy surgical evaluations (Supplementary
Table 2). These patients therefore present an opportunity to
explore STN connectivity with medial PFC. We performed
electrical stimulation of medial PFC contacts and measured
BOLD functional MRI responses (electrical stimulation-
functional MRI) evoked by the stimulation in patients
with depth electrodes in the medial PFC. Similar to
ESTT, electrical stimulation-functional MRI also captures
monosynaptic
connections
(Logothetis
et
al.,
2010;
Logothetis, 2012; Oya et al., 2017). We stimulated mid-
cingulate medial PFC contacts and identified BOLD signal
within the STN region (Fig. 2A, B and Supplementary Fig.
6). In concert with the ESTT data above as well as prior
tract-tracing and neuroimaging data, these results provide
direct evidence of hyperdirect connectivity between the PFC
and STN (Brunenberg et al., 2012; Haynes and Haber,
2013; Averbeck et al., 2014; Alkemade et al., 2015).
We studied the significance of medial PFC and STN con-
nectivity by directly recording from both areas during per-
formance of an elementary cognitive task: interval timing.

sites (contacts 1–2) were accessed by a four-electrode strip placed via burr hole (outlined in black) in human patients undergoing STN-DBS.
(B) Stimulating the STN resulted in short-latency transients (N1) at �12 ms. The latencies of these transients are consistent with back-
propagating antidromic activity originating from STN. Longer latency positive peaks (P1) at �30 ms were also observed. (C) N1/P1 amplitudes at

 This task requires patients to make a motor response 3 or
12 s after a starting cue (Fig. 3A). Interval timing is ideal
for intraoperative neurophysiology because (i) it has simple
instructions and requires a single response; (ii) it is im-
paired in patients with Parkinson’s disease; and (iii) it in-
volves executive functions such as working memory for
temporal rules and attention to the passage of time
(Parker et al., 2013). Because interval timing involves
highly conserved medial frontal circuitry across species,
we focused on medial PFC for the remainder of this manu-
script (Parker et al., 2015, 2017; Kim et al., 2017). During
interval timing, patients with Parkinson’s disease in surgery
responded
at
2.9 � 0.3 s
on
3 s
(FI3)
trials,
and
at
8.4 � 1.2 s on 12 s (FI12) trials (P 5 0.0004). FI3 and
FI12 performance was similar inside versus outside the
operating room, as previously reported (Cavanagh et al.,
2011) (Supplementary Fig. 4). By comparison, control pa-
tients had response times of 3.1 � 0.1 s on FI3 trials versus
12.5 � 0.3 s on FI12 trials (data from 13 demographically-
matched controls in our prior work) (Parker et al., 2015;
Kim et al., 2017).
We used two methods to study human medial PFC physi-
ology during interval timing. First, we directly recorded
from medial PFC using ECoG depth electrodes and found
robust cue-related delta/theta oscillations between 1 and
8 Hz during interval timing (Fig. 3B and C). Second, we
leveraged the fact that midfrontal scalp EEG electrodes (i.e.
AFz, Fz, Cz) reflect medial PFC activity (Cavanagh and
Frank,
2014).
We
observed
cue-triggered
delta/theta
1–4 Hz activity from midfrontal EEG leads in 10 patients
with Parkinson’s disease receiving STN-DBS implants (Fig.
3D). In these patients, we also found cue-modulated low-
frequency activity in the STN (Fig. 3E and Supplementary
Fig. 4) and identified strong �4 Hz coherence between mid-
frontal EEG and STN (Fig. 3F). Such coherence may rep-
resent functional connectivity between medial PFC and
STN but does not measure directionality. Therefore, we
used Granger causality to examine effective connectivity
between midfrontal EEG and STN at specific frequency
bands (see ‘Granger causality’ section). Granger causality
analyses revealed that midfrontal EEG causally led STN
signals at �4 Hz (versus shuffled data: P 5 0.002; STN
! midfrontal EEG: P 5 0.02; Fig. 3G). Similar patterns
of
low-frequency
coherence
and
causality
were
seen
around the time of response (Supplementary Fig. 4). As
in past work, we also noted �12–25-Hz beta coherence
and causality around response (de Hemptinne et al.,
2013; Zavala et al., 2013, 2014; Herz et al., 2016).
Similar 4-Hz STN ! midfrontal EEG connectivity has
also been found during conflict tasks (Cavanagh et al.,
2011; Zavala et al., 2014). Together, these findings dem-
onstrate functional coupling of midfrontal EEG and STN at
4 Hz during elementary cognitive processing.
Recordings from single neurons can provide an add-
itional window into detailed information processing by
neural circuits beyond macro-level signals like EEG and
LFPs (Narayanan et al., 2013a). To further elucidate the
relationship between PFC and STN during interval timing,
we recorded single-unit neuronal activity in the STN during
interval timing with high-impedance microelectrodes used
during DBS implantation surgery (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Significant modulation around task events was observed
in 24 of 36 well-isolated STN neurons (67%). Six were
significantly
cue
modulated
(17%;
Fig.
4A
and
Supplementary Fig. 6) and 18 were response modulated
(50%; Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 6).
Midfrontal EEG recordings from Fig. 3 indicated that
medial PFC can synchronize STN LFPs at 4 Hz. Past
work has shown that medial PFC delta/theta activity is a
prominent cognitive control signal modulated after errors,
conflict, or cognitively salient events (Cavanagh and Frank,
2014) and that it engages single neurons in distant brain
areas to promote goal-directed behaviour. Surprisingly, we
found that cue-related STN neurons had �4-Hz spike-field
coherence with midfrontal EEG (P 5 0.04; Fig. 4C). This
pattern was not observed for response-modulated STN neu-
rons (Fig. 4D) or for STN field/STN neuron coherence
(Supplementary Fig. 5). STN neurons could also encode
Figure 2 Novel functional connectivity between medial PFC and STN in humans. (A) We also studied connectivity between medial
PFC (mPFC) and STN using electrical stimulation-functional MRI (es-fMRI), which reveals functional connectivity from a stimulated site in mid-
cingulate cortex. (B and C) Electrical stimulation-functional MRI BOLD signal was seen in areas with known connectivity, including the STN (data
from an exemplar patient; region of interest in red, BOLD in orange, FDR P 5 0.05). See also Supplementary Fig. 3.

 temporal aspects of interval-timing tasks (Supplementary
Fig. 6) (Fujisawa and Buzsa
´ki, 2011; Narayanan et al.,
2013a; Parker et al., 2015; Karalis et al., 2016). These
data demonstrate that medial PFC delta/theta rhythms
can engage single neurons as well as STN LFPs.
These data lead to the hypothesis that 4-Hz coherence
between medial PFC-STN is critical for cognitive control
during interval timing. We tested this prediction by stimu-
lating the STN at 4 Hz in patients with Parkinson’s disease
implanted with STN-DBS systems while recording scalp
EEG. Of note, high-frequency STN-DBS (HF-DBS) for clin-
ical indications is set between 60 and 180 Hz to treat motor
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (Follett et al., 2010);
lower frequencies at �10 Hz can modulate timing task
performance but typically worsen motor symptoms of
Parkinson’s disease (Barnikol et al., 2008; Wojtecki et al.,
2011). To our knowledge, 4-Hz STN-DBS has never been
explored in any setting. Patients performed interval-timing
tasks in three DBS conditions: DBS off, HF-DBS (at the
patient
baseline/normal
programmed
settings;
120–
150 Hz), and 4-Hz DBS. DBS amplitude, pulse width, and
active contacts were not altered (Supplementary Table 1).
As predicted, 4-Hz STN-DBS increased cue-related delta
activity (1–4 Hz) at midfrontal EEG sites (P 5 0.00006;
Fig.
5A–F).
Consistent
with
past
work,
trial-by-trial
analyses using linear mixed-effects modelling demonstrated
that both cue-triggered midfrontal delta power (1–4 Hz,
300–500 ms after cue onset) (P 5 0.02) and DBS frequency
(P 5 10�16)
predicted
response
times
in
FI12
trials
(Supplementary Table 5) (Cavanagh et al., 2011; Parker
et al., 2015). No similar pattern was seen at midfrontal
EEG around response (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Strikingly, 4-Hz STN-DBS improved Parkinson’s disease
subject performance on FI12 trials, bringing responses
closer to 12 s and the response times of normal controls
(Fig. 5G and H) (main effect of DBS P 5 0.04; interaction
of Interval � DBS P 5 0.004). HF-DBS did not change
interval timing performance compared to DBS off. These
data suggest that 4-Hz STN-DBS can boost midfrontal cue-
related 4-Hz activity and improve performance of interval-
timing tasks by bringing responses in FI12 trials closer to
12 s. Crucially, there were no consistent effects at FI3, indi-
cating that 4-Hz DBS did not merely slow motor responses.
Patients with Parkinson’s disease are most impaired on
FI12 trials, likely due to the increased difficulty of main-
taining temporal processing over durations as long as 12 s
(Parker et al., 2013). These findings are supported by pre-
vious studies showing that STN-DBS can modulate timing,
decision thresholds and other cognitive signals in humans
(Cavanagh et al., 2011; Wessel et al., 2016). When

tasks to study elementary cognitive processing in PFC and STN. During interval timing, patients heard an instruction telling them how long to wait
(3 or 12 s), then a starting cue indicating that they should start timing. Patients reported their estimate of the interval by making a button-press
response. (B) We recorded LFPs from depth electrodes in human medial PFC (mPFC), which has been implicated in interval timing across species.

 integrated with our data on medial PFC-STN connectivity
and STN neuronal activity, these findings demonstrate that
medial PFC and the STN interact at 4 Hz to affect cognitive
control.
Discussion
We leveraged human intraoperative neurophysiology to in-
vestigate human hyperdirect connections between PFC and
STN. First, we showed that the STN appears to be physio-
logically connected to motor cortex and PFC. Second, we
observed cue-evoked delta/theta activity and top-down
functional coupling between medial PFC and STN during
a cognitive task (interval-timing task). Third, we found that
STN-DBS in that same frequency range improved cognitive
performance in the interval-timing task. Typical STN-DBS
protocols used to treat motor symptoms use high frequen-
cies (4120 Hz). Here, we show that low-frequency stimu-
lation (4 Hz) has the potential to modulate behavioural
performance
in
tasks
involving
cognitive
processing.
Together, this work shows that low-frequency signalling
along the hyperdirect pathway can modulate cognitive con-
trol in humans.
Our data provide the first direct evidence of a hyperdirect
pathway between PFC and STN in humans. Notably, our
data are primarily physiological rather than anatomical,
and suggest a functional hyperdirect connection between
PFC and STN. Combined with detailed non-human ana-
tomical tracing studies (Nambu et al., 2002; Haynes and
Haber, 2013; Averbeck et al., 2014), these data indicate
that the STN may receive cognitive input from PFC as
well as motor input from primary motor cortex. This over-
lap provides insight into cognitive processing in the STN
and could help illuminate why STN-DBS has cognitive side
effects in some patients.
Our clinical DBS targeted motor sites in the dorsolateral
STN, which is classically designated a motor integration
area. However, the STN is compact, and there is likely
substantial
overlap
between
its
functional
areas
(Alkemade et al., 2013, 2015; Alkemade and Forstmann,
2014). Non-human primate work shows that the STN
clearly receives convergent input from PFC as well as
motor cortex (Haynes and Haber, 2013; Alkemade et al.,
2015). Our ESTT and electrical stimulation-functional MRI
data capture this frontal-STN connectivity in humans. Past
work has described cognitive processing captured at motor
STN sites (Zavala et al., 2013, 2016; Herz et al., 2016) and
our results indicate that we can detect significant medial
PFC-STN interactions in the motor STN (Haynes and
Haber, 2013; Averbeck et al., 2014; Alkemade et al.,
2015). This complex anatomy might help understand the
cognitive side effects of STN DBS and could also lead to

 new
therapies
for
diseases
with
impaired
cognitive
processing.
Prior work consistently implicates the STN in preventing
premature responses and regulating decision thresholds
(Baunez and Robbins, 1997; Aron and Poldrack, 2006;
Frank, 2006; Aron et al., 2007; Isoda and Hikosaka,
2008; Cavanagh et al., 2011; Zavala et al., 2014; Frank
et al., 2015; Herz et al., 2017; Wessel and Aron, 2017). In
the present study, we found that 4-Hz STN-DBS could
delay responding in patients with Parkinson’s disease on
FI12 trials on which they are normally biased towards re-
sponding quickly. Thus, during interval timing 4-Hz STN-
DBS may better engage medial PFC-STN circuits (relative
to 130-Hz STN-DBS, or DBS off) and thus improve the
ability to inhibit impulsive/premature responses. There
was no effect of 4-Hz STN-DBS on FI3 trials for patients
with Parkinson’s disease; of note, on these trials, patients
with Parkinson’s disease did not have marked behavioural
deficits to begin with (Parker et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2017).
These data are largely consistent with the STN’s role in
decision thresholds, but much work needs to be done to
extend our findings beyond interval timing.
The hyperdirect pathway has previously been shown to
couple motor cortex and STN at beta-range frequencies to
facilitate motor control (Nambu et al., 2002; Zaghloul
et al., 2012; de Hemptinne et al., 2015). Additionally, we
found evidence of 4-Hz interactions. Our findings are con-
sistent with prior reports that STN neurons and 4-Hz STN
LFP activity are involved in conflict and flanker tasks
(Zaghloul et al., 2012; Zavala et al., 2013; Herz et al.,
2016). During such tasks, increased delta/theta coherence
(1–8 Hz) in the STN can be seen at moments requiring
cognitive control, such as after errors or on high-conflict
trials (Zavala et al., 2014, 2016). Medial PFC rhythms
(4 Hz) have been advanced as a cognitive control signal
that is modulated at critical moments when such control
is required (Narayanan et al., 2013a; Cavanagh and Frank,
2014). We extend this line of research to show that medial
PFC 4-Hz rhythms may be responsible for synchronizing
STN
LFPs
and
engaging
cue-modulated
STN
single
neurons.
Our working model is that medial PFC delta/theta
rhythms actively engage cognitive control processes, includ-
ing
single

 processing (Narayanan et al., 2013a; Cavanagh and Frank,
2014; Parker et al., 2014). These cognitive control pro-
cesses are initiated by the starting cue of an interval
timing task, triggering working memory for temporal
rules and attention to the passage of time (Church, 2003;
Parker et al., 2013). FI3 trials place a smaller demand on
working memory/attention. Thus, the 3-s interval engages
less cognitive control than the 12-s interval. Our patients
with Parkinson’s disease have minimal impairments in FI3
trials and HF-DBS produces fewer deficits. However, on
FI12 trials, more cognitive control is required to recruit
working memory/attentional processes; these processes are
impaired in patients with Parkinson’s disease resulting in
impaired timing performance. According to this model, 4-
Hz STN-DBS modulates medial PFC delta/theta activity
and increases cognitive control. Future studies of 4-Hz
STN DBS in tasks requiring additional cognitive control
will further test our model.
Delta/theta
rhythms
are
impaired
in
patients
with
Parkinson’s disease and in animal models with depleted
dopamine (Parker et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016; Kim
et al., 2017), although we note that the high-functioning
patients with Parkinson’s disease who qualified for STN-
DBS in this study had some residual delta/theta activity.
Thus, this frequency band is ripe for exploration of inva-
sive and non-invasive brain stimulation aimed at boosting
cognitive control. Our past work indicated that stimulation
in this range could compensate for deficits in interval
timing
caused
by
prefrontal
dopamine
disruption
in
rodent models (Kim et al., 2017; Parker et al., 2017). In
this study, we found in humans that 4-Hz STN-DBS can
improve performance of an interval timing task. These data
are of particular significance because cognitive impairment
is common in Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore, patients
with STN-DBS may have cognitive decline exacerbated by
high-frequency STN-DBS (Heo et al., 2008; Okun et al.,
2009).
We focus on interval timing because it is a cognitive pro-
cess that is reliably impaired in Parkinson’s disease and
involves delta/theta medial PFC rhythms (Malapani and
Rakitin, 2003; Parker et al., 2013, 2015; Kim et al.,
2017). High-functioning Parkinson’s disease patients who
are DBS candidates can also have impairments during con-
flict, flanker, and stop-signal tasks, but have rather incon-
sistent impairments on other tests of executive function
(Narayanan et al., 2013b). Conflict and flanker tasks also
involve delta/theta medial PFC activity (Cavanagh and
Frank, 2014), but it has yet to be established whether pa-
tients with Parkinson’s disease have delta/theta impairments
in these tasks. These tasks are significantly more difficult to
execute in the complex intraoperative environment. Our
work here is confined to interval timing tasks that we
have studied extensively in humans and rodents in the con-
text of prefrontal dopamine (Narayanan et al., 2012;
Parker et al., 2013, 2015, 2017; Kim et al., 2017).
Future work will be required to establish the scope of
delta/theta hyperdirect medial PFC-STN interactions in
other contexts, and to test whether the effects of 4-Hz
STN-DBS generalizes to other cognitive tasks or real-
world cognitive function.
Our approach has technical limitations related to work-
ing with human patients. Human intraoperative neuro-
physiology
is
conducted
in
patients
with
advanced
Parkinson’s disease who are off their usual medications
and in a complex intraoperative environment. Intracranial
electrode locations in epilepsy patients were dictated by
clinical constraints; thus, our anatomical coverage is often
incomplete and only rarely samples the subregions of PFC
that we are most interested in. We are not aware of prior
lateral PFC ECoG recordings during interval timing tasks.
Technical limitations of combining ECoG, ESTT, and intra-
cranial recordings during interval timing impeded our
ability to record from lateral PFC in this study. Because
�4-Hz signals are a cognitive control signal across frontal
cortex (Harmony, 2013; Cavanagh and Frank, 2014;
Kingyon et al., 2015), we predict that there would also
be strong delta/theta lateral PFC-STN interactions.
Notably, STN-DBS at low frequencies does not improve
and may worsen motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease
(Barnikol et al., 2008); thus, alternative DBS strategies are
likely needed to clinically target both motor and cognitive
function. We also cannot be sure if the effects boosting
behaviour are due to antidromic excitation of the hyperdir-
ect pathway, feed-forward excitation, or other effects of
4-Hz STN-DBS. Still, our data are clear that there are func-
tional PFC-STN interactions at 4 Hz that instantiate cogni-
tive control.
In summary, we elucidated hyperdirect cortico-subthala-
mic interactions in humans. In particular, STN LFPs and
single neurons were coherent with 4-Hz medial PFC
rhythms associated with cognitive control. Additionally,
STN-DBS at 4 Hz improved cognitive performance in an
interval timing task. Our work indicates that it may be
possible to stimulate the STN at low frequencies to treat
cognitive
symptoms
of
Parkinson’s
disease
and
other
human diseases.
