Objective. Functional imaging of synovitis could
improve both early detection of rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) and long-term outcomes. Given the intersection
of inflammation with coagulation protease activation,
this study was undertaken to examine coagulation pro-
tease activities in arthritic mice with a dual-fluores-
cence ratiometric activatable cell-penetrating peptide
(RACPP) that has a linker, norleucine (Nle)-TPRSFL,
with a cleavage site for thrombin.
Methods. K/BxN-transgenic mice with chronic
arthritis and mice with day 1 passive serum-transfer
arthritis were imaged in vivo for Cy5:Cy7 emission ratio-
metric fluorescence from proteolytic cleavage and acti-
vation of RACPPNleTPRSFL. Joint thickness in mice with
serum-transfer arthritis was measured from days 0 to
10. The cleavage-evoked release of Cy5-tagged tissue-
adhesive fragments enabled microscopic correlation
with immunohistochemistry for inflammatory markers.
Thrombin dependence of ratiometric fluorescence was
tested by ex vivo application of RACPPNleTPRSFL and
argatroban to cryosections obtained from mouse hind
paws on day 1 of serum-transfer arthritis.
Results. In chronic arthritis, RACPPNleTPRSFL fluo-
rescence ratios of Cy5:Cy7 emission were significantly
higher in diseased swollen ankles of K/BxN-transgenic
mice than in normal mouse ankles. A high ratio of
RACPPNleTPRSFL fluorescence in mouse ankles and toes
on day 1 of serum-transfer arthritis correlated with subse-
quent joint swelling. Foci of high ratiometric fluorescence
localized to inflammation, as demarcated by immune
reactivity for citrullinated histones, macrophages, mast
cells, and neutrophils, in soft tissue on day 1 of serum-
transfer arthritis. Ex vivo application of RACPPNleTPRSFL
to cryosections obtained from mice on day 1 of serum-
transfer arthritis produced ratiometric fluorescence that
was inhibited by argatroban.
Conclusion. RACPPNleTPRSFL activation detects
established experimental arthritis, and the detection
of inflammation by RACPPNleTPRSFL on day 1 of
serum-transfer
arthritis
correlates
with
disease
progression.
The search for biomarkers to diagnose and moni-
tor inflammatory joint diseases, such as rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), is ongoing and ranges from analyses of
genetics to assays of biologic fluids (1). The need for
direct visualization of inflammatory processes in soft tis-
sues of arthritic joints has given impetus for the develop-
ment of new imaging probes for radiography, ultrasound,
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (2,3). In addi-
tion, optical imaging of molecular processes is an emerg-
ing
field
that
could
complement
existing
imaging
modalities and accelerate therapeutic decision-making.
In murine models of arthritis, near-infrared (NIR)
fluorescence has been used to image inflammation-
activated proteases, including cathepsins and matrix

 metalloproteinases (MMPs) (4–6). Coagulation pro-
teases are also promising biologic indicators of arthritis
(7). In RA, thrombin and tissue factor levels are elevated
in synovial fluid (8,9). In addition, genetic and pharmaco-
logic approaches that reduce thrombin activity also atten-
uate inflammation in murine arthritis models (10–14). A
role of extravascular activation of thrombin in experi-
mental arthritis has been further demonstrated by throm-
bin-based release of a prodrug in arthritic joints (15).
Thrombin has multiple physiologic substrates,
including fibrinogen, factor V
, factor VIII, protease-acti-
vated receptor 1 (PAR-1), and PAR-4 (7). In its active
form, thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, and the
extravascular fibrin deposits seen within RA biopsy sam-
ples (16,17) may provide a scaffold for the accumulation
of inflammatory cells (18). The proteolytic activity of
thrombin contributes to inflammation through fibrin-
independent mechanisms as well, including cleaving com-
plement C5 to the inflammatory cell chemoattractant C5a
(10,19). Although the link between thrombin activation
and established inflammation suggests that thrombin sen-
sors could offer physiologic detection of arthritis, little is
known about activation and the spatial distribution of
active thrombin in soft tissues in early arthritis.
T
o examine the spatial and temporal activation of
thrombin in vivo, we used a previously described ratiomet-
ric activatable cell-penetrating peptide (RACPP) that has a
linker, norleucine (Nle)-TPRSFL, designed to include a
PAR-1–like cleavage site for thrombin (20). This linker
peptide holds a Cy5 far-red fluorescence donor in proxim-
ity to a Cy7 NIR fluorescence acceptor via a hairpin loop
(20). Cy5 emission is substantially quenched in the intact
probe, but upon thrombin cleavage of the linker peptide
there is an increase in the Cy5:Cy7 emission ratio. Protease
cleavage also exposes a polycation domain coupled to Cy5,
which enables tissue adhesion, and effectively tags the site
of protease activity (21). RACPPNleTPRSFL detects physio-
logic levels of active thrombin by a rapid (within minutes)
increase in RACPPNleTPRSFL Cy5:Cy7 ratiometric fluores-
cence in actively clotting blood (20). Clotting-induced
increases in ratiometric fluorescence are significantly inhib-
ited by intravenous coinjection of RACPPNleTPRSFL with
the thrombin inhibitor lepirudin (20). In this study, we
tested if activation of RACPPNleTPRSFL provides an opti-
cal sensor for established and subclinical arthritis, and
if acute ratiometric fluorescence correlates with disease
progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis of RACPPs. A thrombin-cleavable RACPP
(cleavage sequence NleTPRSFL)
and an MMP-cleavable
RACPP (cleavage sequence PLGC(Me)AG) were synthesized
using standard solid-phase 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl syn-
thesis, and all peptides were amidated at their C-termini. A
control uncleavable probe with a methoxy–polyethylene glycol
(mPEG) linker of matching length was also synthesized.
Detailed syntheses including labeling with Cy5 and Cy7 have
been described previously (20,22).
Mice and in vivo arthritis models. Mice were main-
tained at 21°C � 2°C on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with food
and water ad libitum in the University of California, San Diego
(UCSD) animal facility, which is accredited by the American
Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. This
study was performed in strict accordance with the recommen-
dations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The UCSD Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved these
experiments.
Spontaneous arthritis. KRN T cell receptor–transgenic
mice were a gift from Drs. D. Mathis and C. Benoist (Institut
de G�
en�
etique et de Biologie Mol�
eculaire et Cellulaire, Stras-
bourg, France and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and
were maintained on a C57BL/6 background (K/B) (23).
Arthritic mice were obtained by crossing K/B with NOD/Lt (N)
animals (K/BxN). Male (n = 3) and female (n = 6) transgenic
and female nontransgenic siblings (n = 3) were studied at 8
weeks of age. Additional male transgenic mice were used in
pilot studies. Arthritis spontaneously started at ~5 weeks of age
and was fully established by 8 weeks. These strains were bred
and maintained in the UCSD animal facilities.
Serum-transfer arthritis. Arthritic adult K/BxN mice
were bled and their sera were pooled. Male C57BL/6 mice
were purchased from Charles River and were injected with
200 ll K/BxN sera intraperitoneally at 8–12 weeks of age
(day 0) (24).
Measurement of in vivo joint swelling using calipers or
white-light photography. Ankle thickness was measured with
calipers (Mitutoyo America). T
o image toes for swelling, mice
were anesthetized and the hind paws were elevated and attached
by adhesive to a glass slide mounted on aluminum posts to allow
positioning of the slide on top of the abdomen and exposure of
the plantar surfaces of the paws. White-light images were
obtained with a Nikon D90 camera mounted at a distance of
17.5 cm from the supporting platform and a ruler was used for
calibration. Images were exported with Camera Control Pro2
software. Using these images, the outline of each toe was drawn,
and the area was assessed by ImageJ (National Institutes of
Health) and then divided by the length of the toe to obtain the
aspect ratio, i.e., toe thickness (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2,
available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40316/abstract). A series
of toe measurements was performed in normal mice to validate
that this method normalized for differences in toe length (Sup-
plementary Figure 1).
In vivo imaging of ratiometric fluorescence. Mice were
intravenously injected with 10 nmoles RACPP in water while
under anesthesia with 2% isoflurane. After 2 hours the mice
were re-anesthetized for white-light and fluorescence imaging.
Images were obtained using a Maestro 2D fluorescence imager
(CRI), engineered with a tunable liquid crystal emission filter.
Using Cy5 excitation (620/20 nm), fluorescence was measured
across a range of wavelengths (640–840 nm in 10-nm steps).
For ratio quantitation, the intensities of Cy5 and Cy7 emission
70
FRIEDMAN ET AL
 were quantified. Cy5 emission was integrated across 660–720
nm, and Cy7 values were extracted by integration across a far-
red range of 760–830 nm using software designed in-house
(20). The software also produced a ratio image (Cy5:Cy7) in
which the value of the ratio was depicted in pseudocolor (low
ratios from low rates of RACPP cleavage at the blue end of the
color bar and high ratios from high rates of proteolytic cleavage
at the red end).
Ratiometric fluorescence quantitation. Fixed regions
of interest (ROIs) were placed over Maestro single-channel
images of the right and left malleoli (Supplementary Figure 3,
available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40316/abstract) or across
the entire toe. The integrated intensity of fluorescence in each
channel was measured in ImageJ. For each value, background
subtraction was performed, which incorporated the camera
dark current and autofluorescence. The autofluorescence was
calculated from fluorescence imaging of uninjected mice at a
series of exposure times.
Histologic
analysis.
For
microscopic
fluorescence
imaging of RACPP that had been cleaved in vivo, mouse hind
paws were embedded in Tissue-Tek and frozen in 2-methylbu-
tane equilibrated in dry ice, and then tissue was stored at
�80°C. Tissue cryosections (15 lm) of mouse hind paws were
directly mounted onto CryoJane tape (Leica) and imaged
while on the tape to preserve the structure of undecalcified,
unfixed bone. Sections were preimaged for ratiometric fluo-
rescence prior to immunostaining at 640 excitation and 685/
40 emission for Cy5 and 785/60 nm emission for Cy7.
Immunostaining was then performed with antibodies conju-
gated to Alexa Fluor 488 for c-Kit (11-1171-81; eBioscience),
Gr-1
(11-5931-85;
eBioscience),
and
F4/80
(60343-50;
Abcam). Anti–citrullinated histone H3 (5103; Abcam) was
unconjugated and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 secondary anti-
body (A1108; Invitrogen) was used for detection. Antibodies
were visualized with 488 nm excitation and 525/40 nm emis-
sion fluorescence. All images for quantitation were acquired
at 0.4 lm pixel resolution. To assess the staining intensity of
immunotagged inflammatory cells in regions of high and low
RACPPNleTPRSFL cleavage, we adapted the microarray profile
plugin from ImageJ (Supplementary Figure 4, available on
the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.
wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40316/abstract). Briefly, 144 individ-
ual rectangles (500 pixels each) were placed on ROIs for
RACPP (Cy5) and antibody fluorescence (488 nm) for each
immunostained section. Paired measures of fluorescence inten-
sities for each channel were obtained for ROIs with high and
low Cy5 signal. The fluorescence was normalized to the highest
value for each section and the normalized Cy5 and 488 nm
immunofluorescence values were plotted (n = 3 sections across
3 mice). DAPI staining was imaged on a separate series of sec-
tions at 405 nm (excitation) and 460/60 nm (emission). Confo-
cal images were acquired with a Nikon Ti-E microscope.
Ex vivo assay of protease cleavage of RACPPNleTPRSFL.
Cryosections of tissue harvested from mice on day 1 of arthritis
were incubated with topically applied 2.5 lM RACPPNleTPRSFL
or RACPPPLGC(Me)AG. The effect of protease inhibition on
RACPPNleTPRSFL cleavage was determined by coincubation of
2.5 lM RACPPNleTPRSFL with 350 lM argatroban (S2069; Sel-
leckchem). Confocal images of adjacent control sections incu-
bated with RACPPNleTPRSFL in the absence of inhibitor were
used to locate ROIs with high ratio values (>4) for Cy5:Cy7
intensity. The effect of argatroban was determined from adja-
cent sections using these ROIs (12,096 pixel area) with ImageJ.
A minimum of 3 section pairs each from 4 mice with day 1
serum-transfer arthritis and from 3 normal control mice were
assessed.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed
using Prism software version 6.0 (GraphPad Software). Data
are presented as the mean � SEM. Spearman’s and Pearson’s
correlation coefficients were computed to assess linear rela-
tionships. The area under the curve (AUC) from baseline and
receiver operating curves (ROCs) were calculated using Prism
software. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s post hoc
test were used for multiple comparisons. P values less than
0.05 were considered significant.
RESULTS
Noninvasive identification of joints with estab-
lished arthritis by RACPP
. Protease-dependent cleavage
of RACPPNleTPRSFL has been demonstrated in clotting
blood at high spatial and temporal resolution, and the
cleavage has been traced to thrombin activity (20). The
thrombin
inhibitor
argatroban
attenuates
symptoms
in the K/BxN-transgenic model of arthritis (10). Hence,
we examined the activation and spatial localization of
RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluorescence in this model.
Transgenic mice with measurable ankle swelling and
nontransgenic (BxN) sibling mice were injected with
RACPPNleTPRSFL and imaged after 2 hours of probe cir-
culation
(Figure 1A).
Other
transgenic
mice
were
injected with an uncleavable probe (RACPPmPEG) that
has a PEG linker substituted for the cleavable PAR-1–
like
peptide
NleTPRSFL.
Higher
RACPPNleTPRSFL
cleavage is indicated by an increased ratio of Cy5:Cy7
emission, which is displayed as a redder pseudocolor
(Figure 1A). High ratiometric fluorescence was observed
in the ankles and hind paws of living transgenic mice
(Figure 1A). Quantitation showed significantly increased
RACPPNleTPRSFL Cy5:Cy7 emission fluorescence ratios
in transgenic mice compared to sibling controls (mean �
SD 5.6 � 0.69 versus 2.1 � 0.56; P < 0.01) or transgenic
mice injected with uncleavable RACPPmPEG (1.6 � 0.46;
P < 0.001) (Figure 1B). The broken line in Figure 1B
represents 2 SD below the mean RACPPNleTPRSFL Cy5:
Cy7 emission ratio for arthritic paws.
Ratiometric fluorescence originating from tissue
deep to the skin is illustrated by comparison of cryosec-
tion fluorescence to an image of a swollen toe with high
RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluorescence from a trans-
genic mouse (Figure 1C). The toe cryosection showed
that the in vivo high ratio patch stemmed from articular
cartilage and periarticular soft tissue (Figure 1D), while
the neighboring toe mirrored the low ratios observed
in vivo (Figures 1C and D).
DETECTION OF SUBCLINICAL ARTHRITIS BY RACPP
71
 Prediction of subsequent joint swelling by
RACPPNleTPRSFL.
To
evaluate
the
activation
of
RACPPNleTPRSFL in early arthritis, we chose the serum-
transfer model of arthritis because the onset of arthritis
occurs reliably within 3 days of serum inoculation. In this
study, male C57BL/6 mice (n = 6) were injected with 200
ll K/BxN sera on day 0. On day 1, mice were injected with
10 nmoles RACPPNleTPRSFL and imaged 2 hours later
(Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 5, available on the
Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.
wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40316/abstract).
Mice
were
monitored daily (from day 0 to day 10) for toe and ankle
swelling. No measurable ankle swelling was detected on
day 1; however, there was an increase in ankle thickness
in some mice on day 2, with significant swelling observed
on day 3 and continuing to day 10 (P < 0.05 versus base-
line) (Figure 2B).
In order to assess a prognostic value of early
ratiometric RACPPNleTPRSFL fluorescence on day 1, we
quantified Cy5:Cy7 emission ratios for a fixed ROI and
compared these values to associated ankle AUCs, since
the latter measures show changes in ankle thickness
over 10 days. Ankle RACPPNleTPRSFL fluorescence
and
swelling
(AUC)
were
significantly
correlated

2 hours of probe circulation. High Cy5:Cy7 emission fluorescence ratio was noted in the ankle of the K/BxN-transgenic mouse injected with
RACPPNleTPRSFL, and low ratiometric fluorescence was observed in the ankles of the control sibling injected with RACPPNleTPRSFL and the
K/BxN-transgenic mouse injected with RACPPmPEG. B, Cy5:Cy7 emission ratios in transgenic mice injected with RACPPNleTPRSFL (n = 6), their

FRIEDMAN ET AL
 (Spearman’s correlation coefficient [r] = 0.71, P =
0.01). All of the mouse ankles with RACPPNleTPRSFL
Cy5:Cy7 ratios of >4 on day 1 eventually developed
swelling. However, 5 of the ankles that had relatively
low RACPPNleTPRSFL Cy5:Cy7 ratios (<4) still devel-
oped marked swelling over the following 9 days (AUC
>5) (Figure 2B).
T
o extend comparisons of joint swelling and
RACPP uptake to mouse toes, we developed a method to
measure cumulative toe swelling based on quantitation
from white-light images of the plantar surfaces of the hind
paws (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figures 1 and 2).
On day 1 of serum-transfer arthritis, foci of high
RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluorescence were detected
(Figure 2C and Supplementary Figures 5 and 6, available
on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://online
library.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40316/abstract). White-light
images of mouse toes on day 1 of serum-transfer arthritis
did not show any obvious swelling when compared to nor-
mal mice (Supplementary Figure 6). However, quantitation
of toe thickness from aspect ratios, using magnified images,
detected swelling for some toes (Figure 2D). Cumulative
toe swelling was quantified using the aspect ratios for all
toes, which were serially sampled across 10 days, as illus-
trated for 1 hind paw (Figures 2C and D). The AUCs cal-
culated from the toe aspect ratio data were significantly
correlated with the RACPPNleTPRSFL fluorescence ratios
obtained on day 1 for all toes (Spearman’s correlation
coefficient [r] = 0.45, P < 0.0003) (Figure 2D).
We evaluated ROC plots to further assess if
RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluorescence is predictive
of swelling. Digits with an AUC of ≥1 were considered
swollen (while those with AUCs of ≤1 were classified as
not swollen) based on multiple measures of healthy
mice. Ankles of normal wild-type C57BL/6 mice (n = 4)
injected with 10 nmoles of RACPPNleTPRSFL were used
as unaffected controls, and measures from mice with an
AUC of >1 for ankle swelling were considered arthritic.
Although the number of mice was small, the areas of
the ROC curves suggested that the probe was more
promising at detecting future ankle swelling (AUC 0.81;
P < 0.001) than digit swelling (AUC 0.75; P = 0.002)
(Supplementary Figure 7, available on the Arthritis &
Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/
doi/10.1002/art.40316/abstract).

tions of the same paw (Figure 3B) showed regions

 with high RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluorescence. In
similar regions, microscopic localization showed high
RACPPNleTPRSFL Cy5:Cy7 ratio intensity deep to the
skin within juxtaarticular soft tissue as well as in scant
areas that were not visualized in vivo (e.g., digit 5 in
Figure 3B). High magnification revealed only a small
focus of uptake in cartilage (Figure 3B). Application of
a DNA stain, DAPI, in a neighboring section (Fig-
ure 3C) showed that the periarticular patch of high
ratio periarticular fluorescence was hypercellular with
abnormal decondensed DNA-stained nuclei. This con-
trasts with the relatively sparse DNA staining on the
opposite side of the toe in a region of low ratio signal.

harvested
after
in
vivo
RACPPNleTPRSFL
imaging on day 1 of serum-transfer arthritis. Toes that
demonstrated high ratio cleavage were selected for fur-
ther microscopic examination (Figure 4A). Hematoxylin
and eosin staining of neighboring sections demon-
strated areas of cellular infiltration that mapped to
areas of high ratiometric signal (Figure 4B).
T
o characterize the cellular infiltrate in areas with
high RACPPNleTPRSFL cleavage, we immunostained sec-
tions with antibodies that recognize citrullinated histones,
neutrophils, mast cells, and macrophages (Figure 4C). All
antibody markers showed clusters of immunolabeled cells
that intermingled with high RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric
signal. This colocalization indicates that inflammatory
cells in mouse hind paws on day 1 of serum-transfer
arthritis are situated in active protease-enriched niches
(Figures 4C and D). We also immunostained sections
with antibodies for citrullinated histones to test if the neu-
trophil clusters in high cleavage ratio patches were

 activated, because histone citrullination is a signature of
neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (25). Citrullinated
histone immunostaining intensity significantly correlated
with the magnitude of Cy5-tagged ratiometric signal
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient [r] = 0.54, P < 0.0001)
(Figures 4C and D).
Ex vivo assay for protease dependence of RACPP
cleavage in the joints of mice with serum-transfer
arthritis. We examined whether RACPP cleavage could
detect ex vivo protease activity in tissues obtained on day
1 of serum-transfer arthritis from mice that had not been
injected in vivo with RACPP. Sites of inflammation
were independently identified by immunostaining for
citrullinated histones (Figure 5A). Topical application
of RACPPNleTPRSFL on cryosections resulted in high
ratiometric fluorescence in regions of citrullinated his-
tones (Figure 5A), indicating that the probe itself did not
instigate release of nuclear DNA during in vivo testing.
In contrast to the high ratiometric fluorescence ob-
served with thrombin-cleavable RACPPNleTPRSFL, topically
applied MMP-cleavable RACPPPLGC(Me)AG showed low
ratiometric signal in the vicinity of citrullinated his-
tones, although higher ratios were detected in the artic-
ular
cartilage

DISCUSSION
We assessed detection of murine joint inflamma-
tion in arthritis with an RACPP designed with the pep-
tide NleTPRSFL encompassing the cleavage site of
the thrombin receptor PAR-1 (20). High-magnitude
RACPPNleTPRSFL
ratiometric
fluorescence
(Cy5:Cy7
emission ratios >4) (Figure 1B) distinguished the swol-
len joints of transgenic mice with established arthritis
from the joints of unaffected control mice. Upon micro-
scopic examination of high ratiometric fluorescence in
transgenic mouse joints, we observed signal in joint car-
tilage, synovium, and periarticular regions. High-magni-
tude foci of RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluorescence
were also detected as early as day 1 of serum-transfer
arthritis. Notably, these signals were a predictor of sub-
sequent joint swelling in individual mouse ankles and
toes. Microscopic examination of joints on day 1 of
serum-transfer
arthritis
revealed
that
foci
of
high
RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluorescence were largely
restricted to periarticular tissues that were densely pop-
ulated by mast cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and
NETs. Interestingly, there was little extension of high-
magnitude RACPPNleTPRSFL fluorescence into the joint

 space or cartilage. Taken together, the data show
that RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluorescence noninva-
sively detects established arthritis and predicts clinically
significant acute arthritis. The high spatial resolution of
RACPPNleTPRSFL also revealed local differences in pro-
tease activation in affected joints in acute versus chronic
arthritis.
Several features of the RACPPNleTPRSFL probe
design facilitated these studies. RACPPs report active
proteases with a larger dynamic spectral range than
single wavelength probes (26), including those that are
optically silenced by quenching (6,15,27,28). Dual fluo-
rescence also affords an additional advantage, since
uncleaved low ratio fluorescence can be used to confirm
the probe’s tissue distribution. Thus, the high intensity
but low cleavage ratio fluorescence observed in cartilage
on day 1 of serum-transfer arthritis indicates that the
low-magnitude cleavage ratio is not a result of lack of
access of the RACPP to the joint space but instead
results from lower levels of protease activity. Another
advantage is that high Cy5:Cy7 fluorescence ratios were
detected after only 2 hours of in vivo circulation and did
not require an extensive washout period. Based on
ex vivo inhibition of RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluo-
rescence by coapplication of the thrombin inhibitor arga-
troban to cryosections obtained from mice on day 1 of
serum-transfer arthritis, we suggest that the rapid in vivo
accumulation of high RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluo-
rescence is likely due to probe cleavage by activated
thrombin (20), but contributions from other proteases
cannot be excluded.
A role of thrombin in disease modulation was previ-
ously reported in K/BxN-transgenic mice (10). Building on
this observation, we suggest that thrombin activation,
reported by RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluorescence, is
localized to periarticular areas in the chronic transgenic
and early serum-transfer arthritis models. Arthritis initia-
tion in the K/BxN model is hypothesized to stem from the
deposition of anti–glucose-6-phosphate isomerase autoan-
tibodies (29) in joint soft tissue (30) and on charged carti-
lage surfaces (10,31). This pattern of antibody deposition
is paralleled by high-magnitude RACPPNleTPRSFL ratio-
metric fluorescence microscopically detected in the hind
paws of K/BxN-transgenic mice with established arthritis.
Somewhat surprisingly, the microscopic foci of high
RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluorescence detected in
cryosections of mouse hind paws obtained on day 1 of
serum-transfer arthritis were largely excluded from carti-
lage, although foci could be detected in neighboring peri-
articular soft tissue. On the other hand, the paucity of
cartilage ratiometric fluorescence on day 1 of serum-
transfer
arthritis
is
consistent
with
findings
from
structural 3-dimensional imaging by MRI that demon-
strate enhanced signal in periarticular areas and around
tendons on day 3 in the serum-transfer arthritis model
(32), but little signal in the joint space itself. Our data
suggest that the periarticular tissue swelling localized by
MRI is likely accompanied by an influx of inflammatory
cells in early serum-transfer arthritis. In this regard,
RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluorescence would also
likely be more specific for active inflammation than the
perivascular pooling of indocyanine green (33), which
has been approved for clinical use in imaging by the Food
and Drug Administration.
Microscopic examination of joint tissues obtain-
ed from mice on day 1 of serum-transfer arthritis indi-
cated that cleaved probe adheres to regions with clus-
ters
of
mixed
inflammatory
cells.
Recruitment
of
inflammatory cells in collagen-induced arthritis accom-
panies early endothelial activation as demonstrated by
in
vivo
imaging
with
NIR
fluorescence–conjugated
anti–E-selectin antibodies (34). Other in vivo imaging
approaches using conjugation of fluorophores to anti-
bodies or markers for macrophages and/or phagocytes,
such as F4/80 (35), folate (27,36), and S100A8/9 (37),
have previously demonstrated increases in populations
of joint inflammatory cells in acute and established
arthritis. The present study expands on these findings
with the demonstration that the influx of multiple types
of inflammatory cells appears to be coordinated and
targeted to regions of high RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiomet-
ric fluorescence with elevated protease activities.
Previous work with functionally activated probes
for myeloperoxidase activity (38) or cleavage by inflam-
mation-associated
enzymes
such
as
cathepsins
and
MMPs (4–6) has allowed monitoring of arthritis progres-
sion. In this study, we used an alternative approach and
imaged mice by injection of RACPPNleTPRSFL before visi-
ble swelling (determined by eye or caliper measure) in
the serum-transfer arthritis model and then followed
individual mice serially for clinical swelling. Mouse
ankles that had foci of high-magnitude RACPPNleTPRSFL
Cy5:Cy7 emission ratios (>4) on day 1 of serum-transfer
arthritis
developed
sustained
swelling
as
measured
by calipers. However, 5 of 12 mouse ankles that
subsequently developed swelling had low-magnitude
ratiometric fluorescence (Cy5:Cy7 ratio <4) on day 1 of
serum-transfer arthritis and were considered false nega-
tives. Several factors may have limited the detection of
cleaved probe in these ankles. First, the number of views
was restricted by the time required to position the mice
under anesthesia. Images were captured only from the
medial view of the ankles and the plantar views of the
paws. Since the lateral aspect and the dorsum of the hind

 foot were not imaged, this may have reduced the sensitiv-
ity for predicting later swelling. Activation of other pro-
teases in arthritis is dynamically regulated, as suggested
by recent observations of MMP-12 and MMP-13 in
serum-transfer arthritis (5), so that sampling thrombin
activation at a single 2-hour time point 1 day after serum
injection may not detect all areas of future disease.
The serum-transfer arthritis model is known to
be heavily neutrophil dependent (39), and NETs associ-
ated with neutrophil activation are present in the joints
(40). The present study demonstrates that both of these
markers of inflammation emerge within 24 hours of
serum injection and are targeted
to synovial and
neighboring
soft
tissues
where
there
is
elevated
RACPPNleTPRSFL ratiometric fluorescence. The early
targeting of inflammatory cells may reflect thrombin
activation of complement pathways to yield the neutro-
phil chemoattractant C5a independent of C3 (10,19).
Conversely, thrombin is itself generated via tissue factor
pathways that are activated by tissue damage and by
NETs (41,42). Thus, the present work provides visual-
ization of a spatial overlap between RACPPNleTPRSFL
signal intensity and citrullinated histones, which is con-
sistent with a model of positive feedback between the
generation of NETs and thrombin activation (Supple-
mentary Figure 10, available on the Arthritis & Rheuma-
tology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.
1002/art.40316/abstract).
The clinical use of RACPPNleTPRSFL could extend
to monitoring other neutrophil predominant forms of
arthritis, such as gout (43), or other disease states that are
characterized by inflammation and NET formation, such
as vascular injury from vasculitis (42,44). Furthermore, in
this study there were multiple inflammatory cell types that
mapped to the region of high fluorescence intensity, indi-
cating a broader potential for RACPPNleTPRSFL than
solely detecting neutrophil activity. In a T cell–dependent
murine model of multiple sclerosis, a prior generation
probe indicated that thrombin activation preceded the
onset of neurologic signs, increased at disease peak, and
was correlated with deleterious histologic changes and
clinical severity (45). T
aken together, the findings of the
present study suggest that functional imaging with the
RACPPNleTPRSFL biosensor could be used to monitor
both the development and progression of synovitis and
other inflammatory disease states.
