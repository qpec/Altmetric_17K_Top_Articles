Abstract
Application of sunscreen is a widely used mechanism for protecting skin from the harmful
effects of UV light. However, protection can only be achieved through effective application,
and areas that are routinely missed are likely at increased risk of UV damage. Here we
sought to determine if specific areas of the face are missed during routine sunscreen appli-
cation, and whether provision of public health information is sufficient to improve coverage.
To investigate this, 57 participants were imaged with a UV sensitive camera before and after
sunscreen application: first visit; minimal pre-instruction, second visit; provided with a public
health information statement. Images were scored using a custom automated image analy-
sis process designed to identify areas of high UV reflectance, i.e. missed during sunscreen
application, and analysed for 5% significance. Analyses revealed eyelid and periorbital
regions to be disproportionately missed during routine sunscreen application (median 14%
missed in eyelid region vs 7% in rest of face, p<0.01). Provision of health information caused
a significant improvement in coverage to eyelid areas in general however, the medial
canthal area was still frequently missed. These data reveal that a public health announce-
ment-type intervention could be effective at improving coverage of high risk areas of the
face, however high risk areas are likely to remain unprotected therefore other mechanisms
of sun protection should be widely promoted such as UV blocking sunglasses.
Introduction
Despite increasing sun awareness and sun protection usage, between 70–90 percent of basal
cell carcinomas (BCCs) develop in sun-exposed head and neck regions, and 5 to 10 percent of
all skin cancers occur on the eyelids alone[1]. Specifically within England, 33610 eyelid BCCs
were recorded in the 11 years between 2000 and 2010[1]. Within the eyelid area, the medial

 canthus, a region where the medial corner of the upper and lower eyelids meet, has been
shown to be not only a particularly common site for BCC, but is also associated with poor
prognosis [2,3,4,5]. It has been postulated that the high prevalence of non-melanoma skin can-
cer on the eyelids is due to the skin being the thinnest on the body and hence specifically vul-
nerable to damage from prolonged ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, a well-established risk
factor for BCCs and for squamous cell carcinomas [6,7,8,9,10]. Therefore, the importance of
adequately protecting this vulnerable area is clear, and the use of sunscreen formulations has
been widely promoted.
Use of sunscreens for sun protection requires two conditions to be met: i) adequate quanti-
ties of the substance to be applied with appropriate frequency of reapplication, and ii) effective
coverage of all sun exposed areas. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that even when the
frequency of application and quantity applied are appropriate, the application technique in
terms of coverage, is often inadequate [11,12,13,14]. Studies investigating sunscreen applica-
tion to the face with emphasis on identifying commonly missed areas have very rarely been
performed, however, one study in 1994 suggested inferior application to the medial canthal
area in a study of 50 participants [15]. In the 23 years since this publication, through numerous
public health information streams, awareness of the risks associated with UV exposure has
increased dramatically. However, the positive health benefits of UV exposure in terms of sup-
porting the complex sensory functions of the skin, including effects on brain, neuroendocrine,
and immune function, as well as the deleterious effects of vitamin D insufficiency have been
widely demonstrated leading to guidelines designed to balance the benefits of UV exposure
against the potential DNA damage [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. Therefore an updated investiga-
tion into application habits is warranted. Recent data suggest that sunscreens are increasingly
becoming the method of choice for sun protection meaning that it is more important than
ever that sunscreen is applied effectively [24,25,26].
To date, the majority of sunscreen application publications use surrogates in place of real
sun creams to determine coverage. Often these surrogates are of different texture or visibility
which may influence application [27,28]. Recent improvements in the availability of UV sensi-
tive cameras have opened up the possibility of investigating sunscreen application directly
using actual formulations available to the public and obtaining superior image quality com-
pared with the use of a Wood’s lamp [14] or by imaging fluorescent creams [29]. UV photo-
graphic imaging has thus been demonstrated as being useful as a method not only to assess
sunscreen application but also to assess skin damage and drive behavioral change in sun bed
users [30,31,32]. In this study, we have adopted the UV imaging approach to determine if skin
cancer prone facial regions are ineffectively covered, and if an information based intervention
could be used to improve sunscreen application.

 5% after intervention requires 57 participants assuming paired t-test. 57 people (27 male
and 30 female) were recruited in October to December through poster advertising and an
email cascade to all staff and students of the Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, Uni-
versity of Liverpool. There were no exclusion criteria based on demographics, ethnicity or
other personal criteria, however, excluded from the study were volunteers who self-identi-
fied as having allergies to sun lotion. Volunteers were required to fill in a pre-questionnaire
before participating in the study (S1 Fig), requiring them to confirm whether they had used
any form of sun protection previously, and whether they had any known allergies. Partici-
pants were also requested to self-identify their skin-type based on provided Fitzpatrick scale
diagram.
Participants were then allowed to self-select from either SPF50 spray or SPF50 cream sun-
screen formulations (both Nivea, Birmingham, UK) and instructed to apply sunscreen in their
usual manner. No instructions were provided regarding volume of solution to use. UV images
were acquired before and after sunscreen application. The same participants were invited to
return for a second visit two weeks later, where they received an information sheet stating
“Skin cancers most commonly occur on sun exposed areas of the body. Most skin cancers
occur in the face with 10% of all skin cancers occurring on the sensitive eyelid area which is
thinner and therefore more sensitive to sunlight. Using sunblock reduces the risk of getting
skin cancer.” They were then given the same sunscreen formulation as used initially and
imaged before and after application. Participants were not shown the images from their first
visit prior to sunscreen application. Following the second phase of the study, participants were
requested to complete a second questionnaire asking about their experience and to identify
behavioural trends within the population (S2 Fig).
Image acquisition
Participants were sat in front of a plain white background and images captured using a tripod
mounted DSLR (Canon EOS Rebel XTi 400D) with 60mm EF-S macro lens (both; Canon, Sur-
rey, UK). The camera was modified to be sensitive only to UV light by replacing the internal
hot mirror with a UV band pass filter (Lifepixel, Mukilteo, WA, USA) and were photgraphed
with the use of an electronic flash (Vivitar Auto Thyristor Model 285 with fresnel lens
removed, Vivitar, Edison, NJ, USA). Camera settings (F 2.8, ISO 1800, shutter speed 1.2s,),
lighting and distances from the camera were kept constant throughout. The original images
were greyscale ten million pixels images in JPG format.
Image analysis
Manual segmentation was performed using image J (NIH, Bethesda, MA) by an observer man-
ually drawing around areas deemed to be not covered using the freehand selection tool. Due to
observers reporting difficulty in identifying glare/reflection and resultant intraobserver vari-
ability, this approach was deemed ineffective. Therefore, an automated image analysis method
was developed to objectively detect, segment and quantify the areas of the face within the UV
images that were not covered by sunscreen. To counteract differences in skin tones and reflec-
tion, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalisation was first applied to the images using
openCV (http://opencv.org/)[33]. This divided the image into small blocks and each of these
blocks were then histogram equalized using the following algorithm:
Let f be the source image and m x n matrix from the small block

Next, the dlib package (http://dlib.net/) was used to detect facial landmarks within the
image. These landmarks were used as markers for determining the facial region and
theletterbox region surrounding the eyes of the participant. The landmark located at the inner
eye was used to define the medial canthus. The face was segmented from the original image
and the relative letterbox points collated for later use. Gaussian blur (openCV code library)
was then applied to the normalised image to smooth the image and reduce unwanted noise
[34]. The Gaussian equation for a 2D image is defined as:

Where μ is the mean pixel value and θ represents the variance.
The image was then mapped to Hue Saturation Value and thresholding performed to pro-
duce a binary segmented mask of the image [35]. Results for applying the substance were
determined from this binary mask and reported as a percentage of the pixels in each image/let-
ter box region. A binary, yes/no classification was used for the medial canthal region, where
images were scored as not covered if the segmentation detected any missed skin within the
defined region.
Statistical approaches
Data were tested for normality with Shapiro Wilk test. Mann-Whitney tests were performed to
compare coverage between eyelid regions and non eyelid regions relative to gender, skin type,
and sun cream versus sun spray. Spearman’s correlation was used to assess correlation between
percentages of eyelid regions missed with percentage of rest of face. Wilcoxon tests were used
to assess the improvement in coverage. Chi square test was used to assess change in medial
canthal region coverage. Differences were deemed statistically significant where p<0.05.
Results
Eyelid regions and medial canthal areas are disproportionately missed
during routine sunscreen application
In order to study how people normally apply sunscreen to their face and thereby identify prob-
lem areas, we recruited 57 participants (27 male, 30 female) in October to December 2016 and
photographed them using a UV sensitive camera before (Fig 1A) or after (Fig 1B) sunscreen
application. UV light is absorbed by melanin and sunscreen, so areas of high pigment or sun-
screen coverage appear darker in these photographs whereas non-pigmented skin areas or
without sunscreen appear lighter [30]. Analysis of a pre-study questionnaire (S1 Fig) showed
all users self-identified as previously having applied sunscreen and nine had applied moistur-
izer or makeup containing SPF on the day of imaging. No exclusions were required based
prior application of SPF nor on skin tone/ethnicity, as fresh application of SPF50 could be
detected by the UV camera in all cases (Fig 1A and 1B).

 In order to quantify the areas that were/were not covered by sunscreen, we initially
attempted to manually segment the images by drawing around the regions using image J soft-
ware. However, this proved problematic with observers reporting difficulty in differentiating
between reflection or glare and true failure in coverage, giving rise to high intraobserver vari-
ability in obtained data (S1A Fig). Therefore, in order to remove this subjectivity and account
for glare, an automated script was developed. Initially, the images were histogram normalized
to counteract differences in skin tone and flash reflection. Facial landmarks were then mapped
to the image, and the images cropped (Fig 1C). Next, the areas not covered by sunscreen were
segmented through application of a Hue Saturation Value binary thresholding mask (Fig 1C).
Comparison between the manual and automated segmentation revealed that the automated
segmentation generally yielded results within the intraobserver variability ranges (S1B Fig),
however, the automated segmentation generally identified lower percentage missed in partici-
pants where manual observation indicated poor application (S1C Fig), although this difference
in scoring did not increase or decrease with type of the skin (S1D Fig). Previously it has been
demonstrated that manual segmentation is not only time-consuming, but also produces
observer-dependent results, especially for a non-medical study without a clinical definition,
which are more reliant on images of uniform light and tone [36,37]. We therefore elected to
continue to use the automated system with the understanding that although this may increase
risk of underestimation of area missed, it would reduce the risk of obtaining type I errors.

 Preliminary visual analyses suggested that the eyelid regions were missed with higher fre-
quency compared with the rest of the face. As the eyelid area is particularly prone to skin cancer
development [38,39], a letter box region encompassing both eyelids, periorbital regions and the
bridge of the nose was isolated from the other facial regions to specifically assess whether this
observation reflected a true trend in application behaviour (yellow box in Fig 1C, top panel).
Analysis of these data revealed the median percentage of the whole face missed to be 10%
(range 0–22%, Fig 2A). Interestingly, a significantly higher percentage of the eyelid region was
missed compared with the rest of the face not including the eyelid regions (eyelid median 14%,
median non-eyelid 7%, p<0.001 Mann-Whitney test, Fig 2A). Within the cohort, there was a
weak positive correlation between the amount of the face not including eyelid missed and the
percentage of eyelid region missed (r2 = 0.19, Spearman correlation 0.84, p<0.01, Fig 2B) indi-
cating the level of eyelid coverage is more generally related to the overall sunscreen application
ability. Comparison between males and females revealed no significant difference between gen-
ders (Fig 2C). However, analysis on the basis of self-reported skin type indicated that those with
skin types 1 and 2 performed slightly worse than those with skin types 3 or higher, these

 differences reached significance only for the eyelid regions (eyelid: type 1 or 2 = 16% missed,
type 3+ 10%, p<0.05) (Fig 2D). Note the distribution of skin types in this population was
skewed toward lighter skin types (n = 42 type 1 or 2, n = 15 type 3+) which is reflective of the
local population and therefore these findings should be considered with caution.
As the periorbital/medial canthal regions (magenta box in Fig 1C) are particularly at risk
for more aggressive BCC [2,38,39], a secondary binary analysis (covered/not covered) was per-
formed on this region, revealing that 44 of the 57 failed to cover this region (Fig 2E).
In addition to its use for identifying sunscreen application, UV photography also enables
the visualization of areas of existing sun damage in lighter complexion individuals. Careful
examination of our before sunscreen application images revealed numerous examples of sun
damage spots in eyelid regions supporting the concept that this area is at risk for sun damage
(Fig 1F).
Provision of simple risk indication information improved the sunscreen
coverage of eyelid regions
Next we sought to determine if increased awareness of eyelid cancer risk would be sufficient to
drive an improved coverage of the at risk areas. Various methods of behavioural intervention
to promote sun-protection have been previously reported, with varying levels of success. Meth-
ods have included written information [32,40], photo aging imaging interactive presentation
[41] and psychosocial modelling to assess sun protective behaviour [42]. In this study we chose
to use written information as this approach could easily be adopted in the labelling of bottles,
moreover studies have shown that awareness of risk is sufficient to drive behavioural changes
specifically related to sunscreen use [43].
The same 57 participants were invited to return for a second visit, the study was carried out
as previously however prior to sunscreen application participants were provided an informa-
tion sheet stating; “Skin cancers most commonly occur on sun exposed areas of the body.
Most skin cancers occur in the face with 10% of all skin cancers occurring on the sensitive eye-
lid area which is thinner and therefore more sensitive to sunlight. Using sunblock reduces the
risk of getting skin cancer.”
Image analysis revealed at the second visit participants missed a median of 8% of the whole
face compared with 10% in the initial visit (Fig 3A and 3B. Range 0–20%, Wilcoxon Signed
Ranks test Z -3.63, p<0.001). The percentage of the eyelid region missed in visit 2 showed a
statistically significant improvement to a median 10% compared with 14% missed in visit 1
(Fig 3B, eyelid regions from all participants in S4 Fig, range 0–24%, Z -4.66 p<0.001), the non-
eyelid regions showed a below significant improvement to 6% missed from 7% (Fig 3B, range
0–19%, Z-1.82, p = 0.069).
Encouragingly, analysis on a per person basis revealed the greatest improvement in eyelid
coverage to be to be observed in those who had initially achieved the lowest coverage (Fig 3C,
r2 = 0.34 Spearman correlation 0.66, p<0.01, Fig 3D, 11/57 missed >20% in visit 1 compared
with 5/57 in visit 2). Although statistically significant, the overall eyelid region improvement
was relatively small and coverage of the medial canthal area remained poor with 37 of 57 par-
ticipants still failing to cover this region (Fig 3E and 3F).
During the study, participants could choose between use of sun cream or sun spray and
were asked to use the same method on both visits. No significant difference was observed in
regions missed between users of sun cream and sun spray (Fig 4A, Mann Whitney test). This
was unsurprising as all sun spray users first sprayed the solution into their hands and then
applied it to their face, as per the manufacturer suggested application method, rather than
spraying directly onto the face.

 In order to gain an insight into potential reasons why the eyelid regions were missed more
frequently, participants were invited to complete a short online questionnaire 1–2 weeks after
completing both parts of the study (S2 Fig). Response rate was 78% (44/57). Participants
reported approximately equal ease of application (Fig 4B, median score of 80/100 for cream,
73/100 for spray) however, there was a slight perception by the sun cream users of more

 effective coverage(Fig 4C, 53% Cream, 32% spray, no difference 16%). 20 of 44 respondents
answered yes to the question “If you didn’t fully apply sun cream/spray to the eyelids initially,
was there a reason why?” Stated reasons were; risk of stinging (8/20), no perceived risk/usually
rely of sunglasses for eye protection (6/20), awkward to apply to (4/20) and smudging of eye
makeup (2/20) (Fig 4B). Consistent with the perceived risk of stinging, 17 respondents
reported some eye irritation via the post study questionnaire of which 4 reported “stinging”
lasting between 1 and 5 hours (Fig 4E). Finally, 67% of respondents stated that they modified
their sunscreen application in response to the provided information sheet.
Discussion
In this study, we have demonstrated that although overall sunscreen application to the face
regularly achieves high levels of coverage, problem areas still exist in the eyelid regions, partic-
ularly the medial canthus. However, we demonstrate that provision of a short information
sheet is sufficient to drive a small but statistically significantly improved coverage to eyelids
regions, which was particularly effective in those individuals that initially performed poorly.
These data highlight the need for greater public awareness of eyelid cancer risk and suggest
that simple pubic information intervention could be effective. However, our data also demon-
strate that, despite improved awareness, the medial canthal areas were still frequently inef-
fectively covered and therefore use of alternate strategies for protection, such as UV blocking
sunglasses, should be promoted wherever possible. This will have the dual effect of protecting
cancer at risk areas and also protecting eyes from UV damage, thereby reducing incidence of
corneal damage, macular degeneration and cataract formation [44,45].

 The participants in our study were drawn from University students and staff members and
therefore there is a selection biased toward well-educated participants. Moreover, our partici-
pants reflected the local University population and were skewed toward lighter skin types. This
has two important implications for the generalizability of our findings. First; one would predict
that our cohort would have a base line cancer-risk awareness levels and as such are likely to be
vigilant when applying sun protection [43,46]. This may suggest that the disproportionately
poor coverage of the eyelid region could be even more striking in the general population. It
should be noted, that in our post questionnaire just under half of the respondents did not cite
a specific reason for missing the eyelids so, despite a perceived general awareness, their appli-
cation was still relatively poor. Second; our cohort may respond more to our information
based intervention strategy than a broader cross section of the public and therefore we may
be over estimating the magnitude of the improvement. However, information based inter-
vention is a standard and proven efficacious approach in wide variety of contexts in diverse
groups of patients/participants and as such we do not believe this to be a major limitation here
[47,48,49].
When considering the data within this study it is important to consider the behaviour mod-
ifying effect wearing sun protection has. If sunscreen application is only performed when pre-
paring for an extended period in the sun, ineffective application will lead to a false sense of
security in terms of perceived protection. Our data strongly indicate that in routine applica-
tion, the eyelid region and particularly the medial canthal areas are relatively poorly protected
hence at increased risk. The belief that the whole face is protected may repeatedly increase UV
exposure to vulnerable areas that have been missed as people spend longer exposed to the sun.
An important additional consideration is that any public health message must weigh the
benefits of reduced UV induced DNA damage against the positive health benefits of UV-B
induced vitamin D production. Specifically, insufficient levels of vitamin D have been shown
to occur in 50% of the UK adult population with seasonal variations showing severe deficien-
cies during winter and spring [50,51]. Low vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk
of certain cancer subtypes, and other health risks including bone disease, muscle weakness and
diabetes mellitus [22,23,52,53,54]. Dietary vitamin D supplementation can reduce some of
these health risks [22,53], however, it has also been demonstrated that relatively short UV
exposure is sufficient to produce the daily recommended serum vitamin D levels [55]. This is
reflected in National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines which recommend
short periods of non-protected exposure to ensure adequate vitamin D production. The find-
ings presented here do not countermand these recommendations, but rather that emphasis be
made that, when protection is required, extra attention be paid that sunscreens are applied in a
way that does not repeatedly leave the same areas unprotected each time.
Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that a public information campaign is war-
ranted to stress the importance of eye protection from the sun. The ongoing problem of irrita-
tion caused by the sun cream/spray needs to be addressed with an appropriate education
system put in place to educate the public in newer tear-free formulations [56], whilst the
importance of seeking alternate protection mechanisms should be further emphasized.

 S3 Fig. Comparison between manual and automated segmentation. A. Percentage of
cropped eyelid region not covered by sunscreen as determined by manual segmentation. Blue
dots represent maximal values without attempting to account for flash reflection/glare. Red
dots represent manual segmentation where the observer has attempted to adjust for glare. B.
Comparison of automated scoring output (green dots) and manual scoring (red dots) for per-
centage cover. C. Comparison between mean manual score vs automated score. Dotted line
represents exact agreement between scores. D. Differences between manual and automated
segmentation scores plotted as divergence from automatic score. For all graphs, data are from
19 images, in A, B, C each vertical column is a single image sorted by self-assessed skin types.
