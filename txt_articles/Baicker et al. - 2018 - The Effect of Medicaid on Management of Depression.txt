Policy Points:
r We take advantage of Oregon’s Medicaid lottery to gauge the causal
effects of Medicaid coverage on mental health care, how effectively it
addresses unmet needs, and how those effects differ for those with and
without a history of depression.
r Medicaid coverage reduced the prevalence of undiagnosed depression by
almost 50% and untreated depression by more than 60%. It increased
use of medications and reduced the share of respondents reporting unmet
mental health care needs by almost 40%.
r There are likely to be substantial mental health consequences of policy
decisions about Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.
Context: Expanding Medicaid to previously uninsured adults has been shown
to increase detection and reduce the prevalence of depression, but the ways that
Medicaid affects mental health care, how effectively it addresses unmet needs,
and how those effects differ for those with and without a history of depression
remain unclear.
Methods: We take advantage of Oregon’s Medicaid lottery to gauge the causal
effects of Medicaid coverage using a randomized-controlled design, drawing on
both primary and administrative data sources.
Findings: Medicaid coverage reduced the prevalence of undiagnosed depression
by almost 50% and untreated depression by more than 60%. It increased use of

medications frequently prescribed to treat depression and related mental health
conditions and reduced the share of respondents reporting unmet mental health
care needs by almost 40%. The share of respondents screening positive for de-
pression dropped by 9.2 percentage points overall, and by 13.1 for those with
preexisting depression diagnoses, with greatest relief in symptoms seen primar-
ily in feeling down or hopeless, feeling tired, and trouble sleeping—consistent
with the increase observed not just in medications targeting depression but also
in those targeting sleep.
Conclusions: Medicaid coverage had significant effects on the diagnosis, treat-
ment, and outcomes of a population with substantial unmet mental health
needs. Coverage increased access to care, reduced the prevalence of untreated
and undiagnosed depression, and substantially improved the symptoms of de-
pression. There are likely to be substantial mental health consequences of policy
decisions about Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.
Keywords: Medicaid, insurance, depression, mental health.
A
lmost one-third of low-income Americans report
having been diagnosed with depression—twice the rate of
the nation overall.1 Depression has been correlated with worse
health and lower quality of life, along with increased health care use.2-6
Effective treatments for depression exist, but the uninsured are less likely
to have their depression treated than those with Medicaid.7 Medicaid
coverage may thus result in substantial improvements in depression and
quality of life, but because of the many differences between Medicaid
enrollees and the uninsured, the causal connections between insurance
coverage, treatment, and outcomes are difficult to discern. At a time
when policymakers are reevaluating the scope of Medicaid coverage,
better information about the effects of Medicaid on mental health care
and outcomes is crucial.
In 2008, Oregon allocated by random lottery a limited number of slots
in its Medicaid program for low-income adults. This lottery provides a
unique opportunity to study the effects of Medicaid coverage without
the influence of confounding factors that otherwise plague comparisons
of insured to uninsured populations. In previous analyses using the lot-
tery, we found that Medicaid coverage increased health care use (includ-
ing primary, hospital, prescription, and emergency department care);
improved financial security (although had no significant effect on em-
ployment or earnings); and improved self-reported health and mental

health but had no detectable effects on several measures of physical
health.8-11 In particular, we found that Medicaid coverage decreased
the probability of screening positive for depression by 9.15 percentage
points (95% CI: −16.70 to −1.60; p = .018), a relative reduction of
30%, and found a borderline-significant increase in use of broadly related
medications.8
Understanding the multiple pathways through which Medicaid may
have affected management of depression, the nature of health needs for
populations with and without depression, and the aspects of the disease
that were most affected by coverage can help patients, practitioners,
and policymakers better understand the implications of coverage for
this widespread condition. In this paper, we explore the ways in which
Medicaid coverage affected the diagnosis, treatment, and symptoms of
depression and the degree to which Medicaid successfully met mental
health needs. Oregon’s Medicaid program covered inpatient care, outpa-
tient care (including some psychotherapy), and psychiatric prescription
drugs with no copayments. We examine the effect of insurance on the
prevalence of undiagnosed and untreated depression, how the effects of
insurance differed between patients with and without known diagnoses
of depression, the use of different treatments and specific mental health
medications, and a range of depressive symptoms.
Methods
Medicaid Lottery
Oregon held a series of lottery draws in 2008 from a waiting list of
approximately 90,000 people to allocate 10,000 available slots in Oregon
Health Plan (OHP) Standard. Those selected were enrolled in Medicaid
if they completed the application and met eligibility requirements.
OHP Standard provided benefits to low-income adults who were not
categorically eligible for Oregon’s traditional Medicaid program. To
be eligible for OHP Standard, individuals must have been aged 19 to
64, Oregon residents, US citizens or legal immigrants, without health
insurance for 6 months, and not otherwise eligible for Medicaid or other
public insurance. They must have had income below the federal poverty
level and less than $2,000 in assets. OHP Standard provided relatively
comprehensive medical benefits (including prescription drug coverage)
with no consumer cost sharing and low monthly premiums (between $0
 32
K. Baicker et al.
and $20, based on income), administered mostly through managed-care
organizations. The lottery process and OHP Standard, the data sources
on which we draw, and the statistical methods we deploy are described
in much more detail elsewhere.8-11
Data Sources
Lottery and Medicaid Enrollment.
The state provided us with the ini-
tial lottery list and with detailed data on Medicaid enrollment for every
individual on the list. The list comprises our study population, as sum-
marized in Appendix Figure A1. We use these data to construct our
primary measure of insurance coverage during the study period.
In-Person Interviews and Clinical Assessments.
Between September
2009 and December 2010, we conducted a large in-person data col-
lection effort to assess a wide variety of outcomes. The 20,745-person
sample for the in-person data collection included almost all of the indi-
viduals selected in the lottery living in the Portland area and a roughly
equal number of unselected controls. The collected data includes an-
swers from the 12,229 respondents to a detailed questionnaire, includ-
ing administration of the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale
(PHQ-8).12-14
The in-person interview also included a catalog of medications in par-
ticipants’ possession. Medications were categorized using a commercially
available prescription drug database (First DataBank). Our medication
data thus capture only medication possession at a specific point in time,
not adherence or prescriptions that lapsed or went unfilled. Appendix
Table A1 provides additional detail on the mental health medications
possessed by study participants.
We use these data for almost all of our outcome measures as well as
to classify individuals on the basis of prelottery diagnosis of depression.
Additional data sources used in ancillary analyses are described in the
Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
Our analysis relies on the lottery’s random assignment to generate
unbiased estimates of the effect of Medicaid on outcomes. Not all
adults selected in the lottery successfully enrolled in Medicaid (some
selected in the lottery did not complete the Medicaid application
 The Effect of Medicaid on Management of Depression
33
and some who did complete the application were ultimately deemed
ineligible).
The subgroup of those selected in the lottery who went on to be en-
rolled is not comparable to the overall group not selected in the lottery, so
simple comparisons of those actually enrolled to the control group would
not provide valid causal estimates of the effects of Medicaid. Rather, we
used a standard instrumental variables approach to gauge the effect of
gaining Medicaid coverage through the lottery on subsequent health
care use and depression outcomes. The estimates shown in Tables 2 and
3 represent the “local average treatment effect” of Medicaid coverage (or
the effect of Medicaid for those people who received coverage because of
the lottery, but would not have been covered otherwise), using selection
in the lottery as an instrument for coverage.
The methods used here follow those of our prior quantitative anal-
yses very closely and are detailed in the Appendix. Most analyses were
prespecified and publicly archived in advance of completing any out-
comes analyses; analyses that were not prespecified are marked in the
tables with a carat (ˆ). In all analyses we cluster the standard errors by
household since the treatment is at the household level. All analyses of
outcomes from the survey data are weighted using survey weights to
account for survey fielding methods.
Sample Characteristics and Insurance Coverage
A total of 12,229 individuals completed an interview by October 13,
2010 (effective response rate = 73%; see Appendix Figure A1). Table 1
describes the limited baseline demographics collected on the lottery list
itself, confirming the expected balance between treatment and control
groups. Just over half the study participants are women, about a quarter
are ages 50-64 (the oldest eligible age group), and about 70% are white.
In addition to the full sample of in-person respondents, we also focus
on those respondents who report having received a diagnosis of de-
pression that was made prior to the lottery (34% of the sample). This
categorization is based on the recollection of respondents at the time of
the in-person interview. In theory, recollections about diagnoses made
before the lottery could differ between those selected and those not
selected (even though actual prelottery experiences should not differ be-
cause of the random selection); these recollections are, however, balanced
across treatments and controls. Using the same methods as Table 1, the

difference between treatment and control groups is −0.8 percentage
points; p-value of difference = .40.
The categorization of those with a prelottery diagnosis of depression
captures both the individual having experienced a depressive episode in
the past and the individual having had that depression recognized and
diagnosed by a health care professional. Thus, given the recurrent nature
of depression, this subgroup is one with a higher risk of depression during
the study period. It is also likely, however, that this is a subgroup with
greater connection to the health care system (as evidenced by having
received a diagnosis) and willingness to discuss depressive symptoms
with a health care provider.
Those with a prelottery diagnosis of depression are more likely to be
female, which is consistent with the higher rates of depression in women
in general.15 They are also slightly older, more likely to be of white race,
and more likely to have been interviewed in English.
Table 1 also shows the relationship between being selected in the
lottery and being covered by Medicaid. For in-person survey respon-
ders, lottery selection increased the probability of ever being covered by
Medicaid during the study period (between March 10, 2008, and the
individual’s interview date) among those selected relative to the control
group by 24.1 percentage points. Self-reports at the time of the interview
show no change in private insurance coverage. Control group Medicaid
coverage rates are higher overall in the subgroup with a prelottery diag-
nosis of depression, but the increase in coverage generated by the lottery
is not significantly different between those with and without prelottery
depression diagnoses.
Limitations
There are of course several limitations to this analysis. First, while the
random assignment generated by the lottery yields strong internal va-
lidity for causal estimates of the effects of Medicaid expansion, there
are limits to external generalizability. Second, our measures of medi-
cation possession do not allow us to analyze adherence to medication;
rather, they are a snapshot at a particular point in time. Third, we have
limited information on the types of treatment for depression that the
study subjects may have received. Thus, while our analyses yield strong
evidence of the effects of Medicaid on a number of aspects of the care of
and outcomes for depression for this population, there remain important
 36

questions about the effects of different types of insurance coverage and
specific courses of treatment.
Results
Diagnosis and Treatment of Depression
Diagnosis.
Table 2, Panel A reports the impact of Medicaid on the
diagnosis and treatment of depression, both overall and separately for
those with and without prelottery diagnoses of depression. The top panel
focuses on the diagnosis of depression among the sample that reported
not having such a diagnosis before the lottery (n = 8,063). Our prior
analyses had not focused on this group—one where new coverage has the
opportunity to generate a new diagnosis. Medicaid increased the chance
of receiving a depression diagnosis from a health care provider during
the postlottery study period by 5.5 percentage points (relative to 7.4%
of the control group; p = .049). Medicaid also decreased the prevalence
of undiagnosed depression (defined as having a PHQ-8 score of 10 or
higher at the time of the interview, but reporting not having received
a diagnosis of depression) by 6.8 percentage points (relative to 14% of
the control group; p = .047).
Treatment.
Table 2, Panel B explores the effect of Medicaid on mental
health treatments. Medicaid reduced the share of the population with
untreated depression (defined as having a PHQ-8 score of 10 or higher
at the time of the interview, but not reporting receiving talk therapy or
having related medications)14 by 10.5 percentage points (relative to the
control group mean of 16.6; p = .001). It virtually eliminated untreated
depression among those with a prelottery diagnosis (−17.0, relative to
control group mean of 20.1; p = .003)—demonstrating that Medicaid
drives substantial improvements in treatment independent of generating
new diagnoses among depressed patients.
We have previously reported that Medicaid reduced the prevalence
of unmet need for health care (defined as needing health care and not
having that need fully met) by 10.7 percentage points (relative to a
control group average of 39.0; p = .004).8 The next rows examine
unmet need for mental health care in particular. A total of 24.4% of the
control group overall reported not getting all the mental health care they
needed, while 45.8% of the control group with a prelottery depression
diagnosis reported such unmet need. Medicaid reduced unmet need

12.3 percentage points for those with prelottery depression diagnoses
(insignificant; p = .07), and by 6.2 percentage points for those without
(p = .04). Appendix Table A2 shows additional detail on health care
utilization based on prelottery depression diagnosis.
The lower rows report Medicaid’s impact on treatment rates, including
psychotherapy and medications. Only those with a prelottery diagnosis
of depression were asked about use of psychotherapy. Of the control
group, 37.4% reported receiving psychotherapy in the last year, with
Medicaid increasing that share by an insignificant 8.8 percentage points
(p = .196).
We next show use of mental health medications (with drugs and
categories described in more detail in the Appendix). A total of 20.7%
 The Effect of Medicaid on Management of Depression
39
of the control sample is taking at least one of these drugs, and Medicaid
increases that share by 8.8 percentage points (p = .008). A similar
pattern holds for the number of medications.
The next rows break out these medications into several categories.
Examined at this level of granularity, substantial changes are evident
primarily in the use of antidepressants (but only of borderline statistical
significance) and sedatives. Antidepressant use is quite common overall
(16.8% of control respondents), and Medicaid increases antidepressant
use by 5.49 percentage points (p = .07), but with only marginal statisti-
cal significance, consistent with our prior findings examining a broader
group of medications.8 As shown in Appendix Table A3, this increase
is statistically significant for the subset of respondents with prelottery
diagnoses of depression.
Depression is often comorbid with other mental health conditions,15
so we also examine the use of medications for anxiety, bipolar disorder,
psychosis, and the use of sedatives. These other types of mental health
medications are used less commonly than antidepressants, and only the
use of sedatives changes significantly with Medicaid, increasing by 4.13
percentage points (relative to the control group average of 2.9; p = .004).
As shown in Appendix Table A3, there are no statistically significant
differences in the effects of Medicaid on medication use for those with
versus without prelottery depression diagnoses.
Symptoms of Depression
In previous work, we found that Medicaid coverage substantially reduced
the prevalence of depression.8 In Table 3 we explore in more detail the
effects of insurance on the symptoms of depression and whether the ef-
fects differ by history of depression (as measured by prelottery diagnosis).
First, we show the effect of Medicaid on screening positive for de-
pression (PHQ-8 score of 10 or more14) at the time of the interview.
Depressive symptoms are quite common in this population. Overall,
30% of controls screened positive for depression, compared to less than
9% nationally.16 That rate dropped by 9.15 percentage points (p = .02)
for those gaining Medicaid through the lottery.
The prevalence of depressive symptoms is substantially higher for in-
dividuals with a prelottery diagnosis of depression, with 52% of controls
screening positive for depression, compared to 18% of controls with no
prelottery diagnosis of depression. The effect of Medicaid on depression

was not statistically significantly different for those who had received a
diagnosis of depression before the lottery (−13.1; p = .07) versus those
who had not (−5.26; p = .19) (p-value of difference = .34).
Next, we examine which symptoms of depression changed in re-
sponse to Medicaid coverage, using the components of the PHQ-8
questionnaire.14 Medicaid coverage significantly reduced depressive
symptoms (1.18-point drop in PHQ-8 score relative to control mean
of 7.02; p = .019), primarily through decreases in symptoms of having
little interest or pleasure, feeling depressed, having sleep problems, and
feeling tired. Scoring poorly on the first 2 symptoms is considered partic-
ularly important for a clinical diagnosis of depression.12 The bottom rows
report the effects of Medicaid on an alternate survey instrument—the
mental health component of the 8-question Medical Outcomes Study
Short-Form (SF-8), which is used to assess health-related quality of
life16—where we also see an improvement in overall scores.
Discussion
Depression poses a major health burden to low-income populations.
More than 30% of our control group of largely uninsured low-income
adults screened positive for depression, and 24% reported unmet mental
health needs. Amid discussion of the fate of Medicaid coverage, bet-
ter information is needed about the role of Medicaid in the diagnosis,
treatment, and alleviation of the symptoms of depression.
Using the unique opportunity presented by the Oregon Medicaid
lottery, we assess the effect of Medicaid coverage on depression care and
outcomes. Medicaid coverage significantly increased the diagnosis and
treatment of depression, reducing the prevalence of undiagnosed de-
pression by almost 50% and untreated depression by more than 60%.
It increased the use of medications frequently prescribed to treat de-
pression and related mental health conditions, and reduced the share of
respondents reporting unmet mental health care needs by almost 40%.
These changes are consistent with the substantial drop in depres-
sion seen in those gaining access to Medicaid through the lottery. The
share of respondents in whom we observed positive depression screens
dropped by 9.2 percentage points overall, and by 13.1 for those with
preexisting diagnoses of depression. The greatest relief in symptoms was
seen primarily in feeling depressed, feeling tired, and having trouble

sleeping—consistent with the increase observed not just in medications
targeting depression but also those targeting sleep.
There are several limitations to this study. We have limited informa-
tion on the nature of the health care received; we look at only the first
2 years of postinsurance outcomes; and we have little prerandomization
information that can be used for subgroup analysis. There are also im-
portant limits to external generalizability of the results: our population
of low-income adults in Oregon who were interested in signing up for
Medicaid may not be representative of other segments of the population.
That said, the Oregon lottery allows us to examine the causal effects
of Medicaid coverage on the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of a
population with substantial unmet mental health needs. Medicaid cov-
erage resulted in a significant increase in access to care, reducing the
prevalence of untreated and undiagnosed depression and substantially
improving the symptoms of depression. There are thus likely to be sub-
stantial health consequences of policy decisions about Medicaid coverage
for this vulnerable population.

This Appendix provides additional detail on the statistical methods
and data sources used in “The Effect of Medicaid on Management of
Depression: Evidence From the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment,”
as well as additional results not reported in the main paper.
A.
Methods
Randomization and Intervention
Oregon opened a waiting list for a previously closed Medicaid program
(OHP Standard) in early 2008 and then conducted 8 lottery drawings
from the waiting list between March and September 2008. Those se-
lected were enrolled in Medicaid if they completed the application and
met eligibility requirements.
OHP Standard (the lotteried Medicaid program) provides benefits
to low-income adults who are not categorically eligible for Oregon’s
traditional Medicaid program. To be eligible, individuals must have
been aged 19 to 64, Oregon residents, US citizens or legal immigrants,

45
without health insurance for 6 months, and not otherwise eligible for
Medicaid or other public insurance. They must have income below
the federal poverty level and have less than $2,000 in assets. OHP
Standard provides relatively comprehensive medical benefits (including
prescription drug coverage) with no consumer cost sharing and low
monthly premiums (between $0 and $20, based on income), provided
mostly through managed care organizations. The lottery process and
OHP Standard are described in more detail elsewhere.11
Data Sources
Lottery and Medicaid Enrollment.
The state provided us with the initial
lottery list and with detailed data on Medicaid enrollment for every
individual on the list. We use these data to construct our primary
measure of insurance coverage during the study period. These data are
described in detail elsewhere.11
In-Person Interviews and Clinical Assessments.
Between September
2009 and December 2010, we conducted a large in-person data col-
lection effort to assess a wide variety of outcomes. The 20,745-person
sample for the in-person data collection included almost all of the indi-
viduals selected in the lottery living in the Portland area and a roughly
equal number of unselected controls. The collected data includes answers
to a detailed questionnaire, a catalog of medications in participants’ pos-
session, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure measurements,
and assays from dried blood spots. We use these data for almost all of our
outcome measures as well as to classify individuals on the basis of prelot-
tery diagnosis of depression. Receiving a prelottery diagnosis of depres-
sion required having had access to a health care provider in the past,
which may explain the higher insurance rates; alternatively, it may be
that those with a history of depression are more likely to seek insurance
in order to obtain care for depression. These data are described in detail
elsewhere.11
Using the medication catalog and a commercial medication database
(First DataBank), we classify drugs based on primary therapeutic use
for mental health conditions. We separate antidepressants into 3 sub-
groups: (1) SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the most
commonly prescribed class of antidepressants and are generally rec-
ommended as the first-line therapy; (2) tricyclic, monoamine oxidase
inhibitors (MAOIs), and other antidepressants, all of which are older

Emergency Department Records.
We obtained standard emergency de-
partment visit data for 12 hospitals in the Portland metro area from
January 2007 through December 2010. We probabilistically matched
these data to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment study population
based on information provided at the time of lottery sign-up. We use
these data to measure emergency department use for mood disorders.
These data are described in detail elsewhere.10
Statistical Analysis
Our analysis focuses on isolating the impact of insurance coverage it-
self using the exogenous variation of selection in the Medicaid lot-
tery. This approach is detailed in Finkelstein et al.11 We model this as
follows:
yih = π0 + π1MEDICAIDih + Xihπ2 + Vihπ3 + vih
(1)
where i denotes an individual and h denotes a household. MEDICAID
is an indicator for whether the individual was covered by Medicaid
during the course of the study.
We denote by Xih the set of covariates that are correlated with treat-
ment probability (and potentially with the outcome) and therefore must
be controlled for so that estimates of β1 give an unbiased estimate of
the relationship between winning the lottery and the outcome. In all of
our analyses, Xih includes indicator variables for the number of house-
hold members on the lottery list; although the state randomly sampled
from individuals on the list, the entire household of any selected indi-
vidual was considered selected and eligible to apply for insurance. As
a result, selected (treatment) individuals are disproportionately drawn
from larger households. We denote by Vih a second set of covariates
that can be included to potentially improve power by accounting for
chance differences between treatment and control groups in variables
that may be important determinants of outcomes. These covariates are
not needed for β1 to give an unbiased estimate of the relationship be-
tween winning the lottery and the outcome, however, since they are not
related to treatment status. Following our previous work, our primary
 The Effect of Medicaid on Management of Depression
49
specification includes the prerandomization version of the outcome for
data from administrative data sets (hospitalizations or emergency de-
partment visits).
We estimate Equation (1) by 2-stage least squares (2SLS), using the
following first-stage equation:
MEDICAIDih + δ0 + δ1LOTTERYh + Xihδ2 + Vihδ3 + μih
(2)
Here the excluded instrument is the variable LOTTERY, an indi-
cator variable for whether or not household h was selected by the
lottery.
We interpret the coefficient on insurance from instrumental variable
estimation of Equation (1) as the local average treatment effect of in-
surance, or LATE.17 In other words, our estimate of π1 identifies the
causal impact of insurance among the subset of individuals who obtain
insurance upon winning the lottery but who would not obtain insurance
without winning the lottery (ie, the compliers).
The LATE interpretation requires the additional identifying assump-
tion that the only mechanism through which winning the lottery affects
the outcomes studied is the lottery’s impact on insurance coverage. We
believe this is a reasonable approximation; in earlier work we discussed
potential violations; where we could explore them we did not find cause
for concern.11
In all of our estimates, we estimate linear models even though a
number of our outcomes are binary. Because we are interested in the
difference in conditional means for the treatments and controls, linear
probability models would pose no concerns in the absence of covariates
or in fully saturated models.18,19 Our models are not fully saturated,
however, so it is possible that results could be affected by this func-
tional form choice—especially for outcomes with very low or very high
mean probability. In prior work we have explored sensitivity to alternate
specifications (such as logistic regressions) and found that linear and
nonlinear models produce very similar results.
In all of our analyses we cluster the standard errors on the house-
hold identifier since the treatment is at the household level. All anal-
yses of outcomes from the survey data are weighted using survey
weights to account for the sample releases into the field and intensive
follow-up of initial nonresponders; the weights are described in detail
elsewhere.11

Additional Results
Health Care Utilization by Prelottery
Diagnosis Status
Appendix Table A2 explores how the effect of Medicaid on health care
utilization differs for those with and without prelottery diagnoses of
depression. Use of all categories of health care services is higher in the
controls with a prelottery diagnosis of depression than those without.
The effects of Medicaid on utilization are also higher, but those increases
are not concentrated in care specific to mental health conditions. We
note that results for hospitalizations and emergency department use are
similar (and similarly insignificant) when we use the category of “mood
disorders” (shown here) or a broader category of “mental health” (which
includes psychoses, etc; results not shown). We cannot interpret these
differences in use as necessarily attributable to the preexisting depression
itself, however; those with prelottery diagnoses of depression may differ
in other dimensions and may have been more likely to interact with the
health care system (increasing the probability of having their depression
diagnosed).
Diagnosis and Treatment by Prelottery
Diagnosis Status
Appendix Table A3 shows a more complete breakout of the results
shown in Tables 2 and 3 for those with and without prelottery diagnoses
of depression, as well as tests of whether the differences in the effect of
Medicaid are statistically significantly different between these 2 groups.
As previously reported, Medicaid insignificantly increases antidepressant
use overall by 5.49 percentage points (p = .07); the magnitude of the
effect is larger in percentage points for those with a prelottery depression
diagnosis (9.87; p = .152) but is only statistically significant for those
without (4.76; p = .033) and represents a larger percent increase relative
to the control group rate. In general, while the differences between the
2 groups are often in the expected direction, the differences between
the 2 groups in the effect of Medicaid are not statistically significant.

aFor each sample, the first column reports the control mean of the dependent variable (with standard deviation for continuous outcomes in parentheses). The
second column reports the estimated intent-to-treat effect of lottery selection (with standard error in parentheses). The third column reports the estimated
local average treatment effect of Medicaid coverage (with standard error in parentheses). The fourth column reports the p-value of the estimated effects. See
Appendix for estimating equations. All regressions include indicators for the number of household members on the lottery list and adjust standard errors
for household clusters. The analyses of ED visits and hospitalizations also control for the prerandomization version of the outcome. All analysis is weighted
using survey weights.
Samples for all measures except ED consist of all in-person interview respondents (n = 12,229), those with a prelottery diagnosis of depression (n = 4,166)
and those without (n = 8,063). Samples for ED visits consist of the overlap between the ED sample and interview respondents (n = 10,178), and those in
the overlap with a prelottery diagnosis of depression (n = 3,438) and without (n = 6,740).

eAn analysis of this outcome for the full Oregon Health Insurance Experiment sample (n = 74,922) was previously reported in Finkelstein et al 2012.11
Here we report the results limiting to survey respondents (n = 12,229). To calculate the implied annual spending effects associated with the estimated
utilization effects we use data from the 2002-2007 (pooled) Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) on expenditures of all nonelderly (19-64) adults
below 100% of poverty who are publicly insured. This gives us a total sample of over 7,500 individuals. We use their expenditures (all inflated with the
CPI-U to 2007 dollars) to calculate average expenditures per outpatient visit, average expenditures per ED visit, and average expenditures per inpatient visit
(for visits not related to childbirth). For medications, we calculate average spending per prescription drug by dividing total annual prescription drug costs
by the total number of prescription drugs taken over the course of the year. All spending numbers are based on total expenditures (ie, not just expenditures
among the insured or covered by insurance). The underlying costs are $150 per outpatient visit, $435 per ED visit, $7,523 per inpatient visit, and $312 per
prescription drug. For each type of use (office visit, ED visit, inpatient visit, and prescription drug), we multiply the estimated annual change in number by
the cost estimated in the MEPS.

aFor each sample, the first column reports the control mean of the dependent variable (with standard deviation for continuous outcomes in parentheses). The
second column reports the estimated local average treatment effect of Medicaid coverage (with standard error in parentheses). See Appendix for estimating
equation. All regressions include indicators for the number of household members on the lottery list and adjust standard errors for household clusters. The
final column reports the p-value for a test for treatment effect heterogeneity by prelottery diagnosis of depression. All analysis is weighted using survey
weights. Samples consist of all in-person interview respondents (n = 12,229), those with a pre-lottery diagnosis of depression (n = 4,166) and those without
(n = 8,063).
bTrazodone and branded equivalents are excluded from these summary measures.
cAggregate result for all survey respondents previously reported in Baicker et al 2013.8
dThis analysis was not prespecified.
