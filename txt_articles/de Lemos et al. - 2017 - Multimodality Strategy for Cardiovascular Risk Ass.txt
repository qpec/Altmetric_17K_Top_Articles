BACKGROUND: Current strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 
assessment among adults without known CVD are limited by suboptimal 
performance and a narrow focus on only atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). We 
hypothesized that a strategy combining promising biomarkers across multiple 
different testing modalities would improve global and atherosclerotic CVD risk 
assessment among individuals without known CVD.
METHODS: We included participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis) (n=6621) and the Dallas Heart Study (n=2202) who were 
free from CVD and underwent measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy 
by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, 
high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. 
Associations of test results with the global composite CVD outcome (CVD 
death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, 
incident heart failure, or atrial fibrillation) and ASCVD (fatal or nonfatal 
myocardial infarction or stroke) were assessed over >10 years of follow-
up. Multivariable analyses for the primary global CVD end point adjusted for 
traditional risk factors plus statin use and creatinine (base model).
RESULTS: Each test result was independently associated with global 
composite CVD events in MESA after adjustment for the components of 
the base model and the other test results (P<0.05 for each). When the 5 
tests were added to the base model, the c-statistic improved from 0.74 to 
0.79 (P=0.001), significant integrated discrimination improvement (0.07, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.08, P<0.001) and category free net 
reclassification improvement (0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.56; P=0.003) were 
observed, and the model was well calibrated (χ2=12.2, P=0.20). Using a 
simple integer score counting the number of abnormal tests, compared with 
those with a score of 0, global CVD risk was increased among participants 
with a score of 1 (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6), 2 (hazard 
ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3–4.4), 3 (hazard ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.4–6.5), and ≥4 
(hazard ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 5.2–10.6). Findings replicated in the Dallas Health 
Study were similar for the ASCVD outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Among adults without known CVD, a novel multimodality 
testing strategy using left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery 
calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac 
troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein significantly improved global 
CVD and ASCVD risk assessment.

S
trategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk as-
sessment among adults without known CVD remain 
largely based on traditional atherosclerosis risk fac-
tors.1 However, these risk prediction equations provide 
only moderate discrimination of atherosclerotic cardio-
vascular disease (ASCVD) risk.1–3 Moreover, these algo-
rithms typically do not consider risk for additional car-
diovascular events, such as heart failure (HF) and atrial 
fibrillation, which are increasingly important contributors 
to the overall burden of CVD in the population.4,5 A grow-
ing body of evidence suggests that preventive interven-
tions such as weight loss, exercise, and more aggressive 
blood pressure control may favorably impact ASCVD as 
well as these other highly relevant CVD outcomes.6–8
Previous studies have evaluated individual novel risk 
markers in an attempt to improve CVD risk prediction 
and have identified several promising blood- and imag-
ing-based biomarkers.9–20 However, for individual bio-
markers, even those independently associated with out-
comes, the incremental improvement in discrimination 
and risk classification is typically modest.21,22 As a result, 
investigators have explored combinations of biomark-
ers as a potential strategy to augment CVD risk predic-
tion, with mixed results.23–28 It is important to note that 
these earlier studies have mostly combined biomarkers 
within the same testing modality, such as panels of ge-
netic variants or circulating protein biomarkers, have 
frequently studied biomarkers with limited specificity for 
cardiovascular disease, and have included combinations 
of highly correlated biomarkers.29 To our knowledge, no 
large studies have combined the most promising indi-
vidual biomarkers across multiple different testing mo-
dalities in an attempt to create a risk prediction tool that 
augments traditional risk factor strategies.
We hypothesized that a panel combining nonredun-
dant CVD biomarkers across multiple different testing 
modalities would overcome these limitations and improve 
CVD risk prediction. The tests prospectively selected 
included 12-lead ECG for assessment of left ventricu-
lar hypertrophy (ECG-LVH),30–32 coronary artery calcium 
(CAC) measurement by computed tomography (CT),11–13 
and measurement of N-terminal probrain natriuretic pep-
tide (NT-proBNP)14–16 high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T 
(hs-cTnT)17–20 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-
CRP).9,10 These tests were selected because they reflect 
distinct and relevant pathological processes, multiple 
reports from population-based studies demonstrate inde-
pendent associations of these measurements with CVD 
outcomes, and sufficient data exist from which to gener-
ate a priori thresholds to define abnormal test results.
METHODS
Study Populations
Study participants were included from examination 1 of the 
MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) and phase 1 of 
the DHS (Dallas Heart Study). Both MESA and DHS are ongo-
ing, multi-ethnic, population-based cohort studies, with meth-
ods previously described.33,34 Between 2000 and 2002, MESA 
enrolled 6814 participants 45 to 84 years of age who were 
free from known CVD. For the present study, we excluded par-
ticipants missing results from any of the 5 tests, with incom-
plete follow-up, or missing any of the covariates required for 
the multivariable analyses, resulting in a final study population 
of 6621, with complete data for all covariates (Figure I in the 
online-only Data Supplement). A total of 3072 participants from 
DHS 30 to 65 years of age completed the 3 DHS phase 1 visits 
between 2000 and 2002, including a detailed in-home survey, 
laboratory testing, and imaging tests and ECG. For the present 
study, we excluded participants with prevalent CVD at baseline 
as well as those missing data on test results or covariates, or 
with incomplete follow-up, resulting in 2202 participants with 
complete data for all covariates (Figure I in the online-only Data 
Supplement). MESA was approved by the Institutional Review 
Boards of the University of Washington and the participating 
sites, and DHS was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. All partici-
pants provided written informed consent.

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• We evaluated a novel strategy for assessment of car-
diovascular disease risk among adults without known 
cardiovascular disease that combined promising bio-
markers across multiple different testing modalities, 
including 12-lead ECG for assessment of left ventricu-
lar hypertrophy, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal 
probrain natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac 
troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.
• Each test result provided incremental information 
with regard to global cardiovascular disease risk in 
MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), and a 
score containing the 5 results provided robust strati-
fication of global and atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease risk, with findings replicated in the Dallas 
Heart Study.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Our findings support the potential value of a multi-
modality testing strategy in selected individuals in 
whom additional risk stratification is desired beyond 
measurement of traditional atherosclerosis risk 
factors.
• Additional studies are needed to validate the present 
findings, determine the optimal approach to imple-
mentation, and address direct and indirect cost 
implications of the additional testing.

hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and 
low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol have been previously 
described for MESA33 and DHS35 and are based on conven-
tional clinical definitions.
Multimodality Testing
LVH was determined from standard 12-lead ECGs using the 
Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria and defined as present or 
absent.36 In MESA, CAC scans were performed in duplicate 
using either electron beam or multidetector CT.37 CAC scores 
were expressed in Agatston units, and the mean of the 2 scans 
was used. In DHS, CAC measurements were obtained from 
electron beam CT scans performed in duplicate 1 to 2 min-
utes apart as previously described.38 To minimize false-positive 
CAC classifications because of tissue-associated artifact, a 
mean Agatston score >10 U was defined as CAC-positive sta-
tus.38 NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT were measured using the Cobas 
e601 in MESA and the Elecysys-2010 in DHS18,39 (both Roche 
Diagnostics). hs-CRP was measured using the BNII nephelom-
eter (Dade Behring, Inc.) in MESA40 and the Roche/Hitachi 912 
System, Tina-quant assay (Roche Diagnostics) in DHS.41 The 
following thresholds were prospectively selected to define ele-
vated biomarker levels: NT-proBNP ≥100 pg/mL42 hs-cTnT ≥5 
ng/L (the limit of detection),43 and hs-CRP ≥3 mg/L.44 Values 
below the limit of blank of the hs-cTnT assay were arbitrarily 
assigned a level of 1.5 ng/L.
Cohort Follow-Up and End Point Collection
In MESA, participants were contacted by a telephone inter-
viewer at 9- to 12-month intervals to inquire about hospital 
admissions, CVD diagnoses, and deaths. Medical records and 
death certificates were requested for all suspected cases, with 
records obtained in 98% of reported hospitalized CVD events. 
In DHS, fatal events were ascertained for all subjects using 
the National Death Index. Deaths were classified as cardiovas-
cular if they included International Statistical Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision codes I00–I99. In the DHS, 2 overlap-
ping approaches were used to capture nonfatal events: (1) a 
detailed health survey regarding interval cardiovascular events 
was administered by the Data Coordinating Center during 
annual calls to study subjects; and (2) for subjects providing 
informed consent (>90%), quarterly tracking was performed 
for hospital admissions using the Dallas–Fort Worth Hospital 
Council Data Initiative Database, which includes all hospital 
admission data for 70 out of 72 hospitals in the Dallas–Fort 
Worth area. Primary clinical source documents were collected 
and reviewed for all suspected nonfatal cardiovascular events 
in both MESA and DHS and were independently adjudicated by 
blinded end point committees. Follow-up data for both fatal and 
nonfatal events was complete through December 31, 2012, in 
MESA and December 31, 2011, in DHS.
Study End Points
The primary outcome was prospectively defined as time to 
the first event of a global CVD composite of cardiovascular 
death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral 
revascularization >3 months after enrollment, incident HF, 
or atrial fibrillation. The major secondary end point was hard 
ASCVD events, including fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction 
and fatal or nonfatal stroke. Tertiary end points included coro-
nary heart disease (CHD) (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion), incident HF, all-cause mortality, and CVD mortality. The 
tertiary end points were evaluated with univariable analyses 
only in DHS because of the small numbers of these events, 
which precluded multivariable adjustment. A blanking period 
of 3 months for revascularization events was used to account 
for any influence of the study visit or CAC measurement on 
revascularization decisions.
Statistical Methods
All analyses were performed separately in MESA and DHS. 
The analysis strategy considered the test results as both con-
tinuous and categorical variables. In the continuous variable 
analyses, CAC, NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT, and hs-CRP were mod-
eled as natural log-transformed continuous variables, with a 
value of 1 added to CAC because of the large numbers of 
zero values, and ECG-LVH was modeled as a dichotomous vari-
able. In the categorical analyses, all variables were modeled 
as dichotomous variables using the prespecified cutpoints 
described previously. Associations of test results with study 
outcomes were assessed using unadjusted and adjusted Cox 
proportional hazards models, with all covariates determined a 
priori. The base model included traditional risk factors: age, 
sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, total 
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood 
pressure, blood pressure medications, and statin use. For the 
primary global CVD outcome, serum creatinine was included in 
the base model, and for the HF outcome, both creatinine and 
body mass index were included in the base model.45,46 The first 
multivariable model added individual test results to the base 
model, and the second model added all 5 of the test results to 
the base model. Assumptions for the Cox proportional hazards 
models were verified by Schoenfeld residuals.
Improvement in discrimination and reclassification for the 
primary global CVD outcome and the secondary ASCVD out-
come was assessed by comparing the base model with the 
model that included the base model plus the 5 screening tests. 
Discrimination was assessed using Harrell’s c-statistic, with 
confidence intervals determined by a jackknife resampling 
method. Improvement in the c-statistic was determined using 
bootstrap resampling. Integrated discrimination improvement, 
reflecting the difference in discrimination slopes between mod-
els with and without the markers, was determined using the fail-
ure probabilities from the Cox-proportional hazards models.47 
Category-free net reclassification improvement was performed 
for all end points according to methods described by Pencina 
et al.48 Calibration of the global CVD and ASCVD models was 
assessed by the modified Hosmer–Lemeshow test for time-to-
event data. For the primary analyses, coefficients were deter-
mined separately for each model in MESA and DHS. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed in which the full multivariable mod-
els with continuous biomarker coefficients from MESA were 
applied directly to the DHS cohort.
To facilitate clinical application of the multimodality strat-
egy, a simple integer score counting the number of abnormal 
screening test results was created, with values ranging from 
0 to 5. In MESA scores of 4 to 5 were collapsed, and in DHS 
scores of 3 to 5 were collapsed because of the small num-
bers of participants in the highest risk categories. Cumulative

rates of the primary composite outcome were determined 
and displayed using the Nelson–Aalen failure estimator, with 
groups compared with the log-rank test. Multivariable adjusted 
Cox-proportional hazards analyses were performed, adjust-
ing for the variables contained in the base model. A similar 
approach using the same integer score was used for second-
ary and tertiary end points. Unadjusted stratified analyses were 
performed in subgroups defined by sex, younger age (men 
<55, women <65), race/ethnicity (black, white, Hispanic), and 
estimated 10-year ASCVD risk <7.5% using the pooled cohort 
equations.1
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 
(SAS Institute, Inc.), and all P values are 2-sided with an alpha 
of 0.05. Published SAS macros were used to assess measures 
of fit.49
RESULTS
Participant characteristics are detailed in Table 1. Medi-
an age at enrollment was 62 years in MESA and 44 years 
in DHS. In MESA, over a median 11 years of follow-up, 
1026 global CVD events occurred, including 486 ASCVD 
events. In the DHS, over a median follow-up period of 
10.3 years, 179 global CVD events occurred, including 
96 ASCVD events. The prevalence of abnormal results 
on the 5 tests in MESA and DHS is shown in Table 1  
and ranged from 9% for ECG-LVH (in both cohorts) to 
45% for hs-CRP (in DHS). The individual test results were 
not highly correlated in either MESA or DHS (Tables I and 
II in the online-only Data Supplement).
Associations of Test Results With Outcomes
In MESA, each of the 5 tests was associated with the 
primary global CVD outcome after adjustment for tradi-
tional risk factors and the other test results, with results 
consistent whether the tests were considered as con-
tinuous variables or using the prospective dichotomous 
cutpoints (Table 2). Findings replicated in DHS, with the 
exception that hs-CRP was not independently associated 
with global CVD after multivariable adjustment (Table 2).
Associations of the test results with the secondary com-
posite ASCVD outcomes are shown in Table 3. In MESA, 
each of the test results except hs-CRP was independently 
associated with ASCVD. In DHS, associations of hs-CRP 
and hs-cTnT with ASCVD were attenuated after adjustment 
for risk factors (Table 3). Associations of the screening 
tests with tertiary end points were largely concordant in 
MESA and DHS, with variation seen depending on which 
end point was evaluated (Tables III–VI in the online-only 
Data Supplement). CAC was most strongly associated 
with coronary heart disease events, followed by NT-proB-
NP and hs-cTnT, with no association seen for ECG-LVH 
or hs-CRP (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement). 
All 5 test results were independently associated with in-
cident HF, with the largest hazards seen for NT-proBNP, 
ECG-LVH, and hs-cTnT. NT-proBNP demonstrated the larg-

Evaluation of Risk Prediction Metrics
Addition of the 5 tests to the base model improved the 
 
c-statistic for global and ASCVD in both DHS and MESA 
and for each of the tertiary end points in MESA (P<0.01 
for each; Table 4), with the largest increase in c-statistic 
seen for the global CVD and HF end points. Addition of 
the test results also resulted in significant category-free 
net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimi-
nation improvement for the global CVD end point in both 
MESA and DHS (Table 4). Models including the 5 tests 
were well calibrated in both MESA and DHS for both glob-
al and ASCVD end points (Figures II and III in the online-
only Data Supplement). In exploratory analyses focusing 
only on the ASCVD end point in MESA, the largest im-
provement in risk prediction metrics was observed when 
CAC was added to the base model, with modest but sig-
nificant increments beyond CAC in the c-statistic, net re-
classification improvement, and integrated discrimination 
improvement observed for the addition of NT-proBNP and 
hs-cTnT but not for the addition of ECG-LVH or hs-CRP 
(Table VII in the online-only Data Supplement).
In sensitivity analyses, the MESA base models and 
models including all 5 test results were applied directly 
to DHS using coefficients for all variables derived from 
MESA. In these analyses, both base and fully adjusted 
models had lower c-statistics than the models in which 
the coefficients were derived in the DHS dataset. How-
ever, improvements in the c-statistic, net reclassification 
improvement, and integrated discrimination improvement 
were similar using the 2 modeling strategies (Table VIII 
in the online-only Data Supplement). Calibration remained 
adequate in DHS when the MESA models were directly ap-

plied (Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement) but as 
expected was worse compared with the models in which 
coefficients were derived in DHS.
Multimodality Risk Score
Participants were assigned 1 point for each abnormal 
test result, yielding an integer score ranging from 0 to 
5. The proportion of individuals with scores of 0, 1, 2, 
3, or ≥4 was 20%, 30%, 27%, 17%, and 6% in MESA 
and the proportion with scores of 0, 1, 2, and ≥3 in DHS 
was 35%, 42%, 17%, and 7%, respectively (Figure V in 
the online-only Data Supplement). A >20-fold gradient 
of risk for both global CVD and ASCVD was observed 
across higher scores in both MESA and DHS (Figure 1). 
In MESA, participants with scores ≥2 comprised <50% 
of the cohort but accounted for 79% of the events. In 
the younger DHS population, participants with a score 
≥2 comprised 24% of the cohort but accounted for 58% 
of events (Figure V in the online-only Data Supplement). 
In both MESA and DHS, consistent graded associations 
with global CVD and ASCVD risk were seen with increas-
ing scores across sex and race/ethnic subgroups and in 
younger and lower risk individuals (Figure 2, Figure VI in 
the online-only Data Supplement).
As expected, higher scores were associated with a 
greater burden of traditional risk factors (Tables IX and 
X in the online-only Data Supplement). However, in multi-
variable analyses accounting for traditional risk factors, 
compared with those with a score of 0 in MESA, CVD risk 
increased among participants with a score of 1 (hazard 
ratio [HR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–2.6), 2 
(HR, 3.2; 95% CI 2.3–4.4), 3 (HR, 4.7; 95% CI 3.4–6.5), 
and ≥4 (HR, 7.5, 95% CI, 5.2–10.6)  
(Figure 3). Similar 
graded associations across higher scores were seen 
for the secondary ASCVD end point and with tertiary 
end points, with findings most robust for incident HF 
 
(Figure 3). In the DHS, higher scores were also asso-
ciated with global CVD, ASCVD, and all-cause mortality 
in the fully adjusted models (Figure VII in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we combined 5 promising tests for 
cardiovascular risk stratification among adults without 
known CVD: the 12-lead ECG to assess LVH, CAC scan-
ning, and measurement of NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT, and hs-
CRP. Although this combination of tests captures multiple

well-defined cardiac pathological processes, including 
cardiac hypertrophy, coronary atherosclerosis, neuro-
hormonal activation, cardiomyoctye injury, and inflamma-
tion, to our knowledge they have not been considered 
together previously. Each test provided nonredundant 
incremental information to traditional risk factors, and 
when the test results were combined in a simple integer 
score, a >20-fold gradient in risk for the primary global 
CVD outcome was seen across the range of scores af-
ter >10 years of follow-up. The findings were consistent 
among women, ethnic minorities, younger individuals, 
and those at low predicted risk for ASCVD. Results were 
robust to multivariable adjustment and across different 
CVD end points, and replicated in 2 distinct cohorts 
with different age ranges and race/ethnic distributions. 
Discrimination and risk classification were improved for 
both global and ASCVD outcomes, and models incor-
porating the screening test results were generally well 
calibrated. These findings provide strong evidence that 
a simple strategy including the most promising biomark-
ers from several different testing modalities substantially 
improves CVD risk prediction among individuals without 
known CVD.
CVD risk stratification has traditionally been focused 
on predicting only CHD events. More recently, in concert 
with changes in prevention guidelines,1,50 the focus of 
CVD risk prediction has expanded to include stroke. It is 
notable that although rates of myocardial infarction and 
stroke have been steadily declining,51 the prevalence of 
HF is projected to increase by 25% over the next 20 
years.4 Among middle-age adults, the 10-year risk of in-
cident HF is ≈10%,52 with lifetime risks of 30% to 40%.53 
Tools to predict incident HF may allow targeted therapies 
to prevent its development, which could have important 
public health implications given its associated morbid-
ity and mortality. To date only a single global CVD risk 
model has been developed that considers ASCVD and 
HF together54 and differs from our approach because it 
only contained traditional CHD risk factors as covariates 
and did not include atrial fibrillation as part of the global 
CVD outcome.54 Like HF, atrial fibrillation is rapidly in-
creasing in prevalence, is difficult to treat once present, 
and carries substantial costs and morbidity.5,55 A focus 
on global CVD risk prediction, incorporating end points 
of HF and atrial fibrillation as was done in the present 
study, is likely to become increasingly important. It is im-
portant to note that global CVD risk assessment should 
be considered as a complement and not a replacement 
for cause-specific risk estimation (ie, for ASCVD).
Although the individual biomarkers were each associ-
ated with the primary composite global CVD end point, 
they differed in their relative associations with second-
ary and tertiary CVD end points, as would be expected 
on the basis of the pathological processes captured 
by each biomarker.11,15,18,31,39 For example, CAC dem-
onstrated the largest HR for ASCVD and CHD events,

whereas NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT were associated with 
the highest hazards for all-cause and CVD mortality and 
HF. It is notable that although NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT 
were included to enhance global CVD risk prediction, 
they also provided independent prognostic value for AS-
CVD and CHD in MESA. While hs-CRP provided modest 
incremental information for the global CVD and HF end 
points, this biomarker generally demonstrated the weak-
est and least consistent associations across the port-
folio of end points. Further, the multimodality strategy 
provided robust discrimination and reclassification for 
ASCVD and global CVD events. Thus, this strategy may 
contribute to more accurate identification of appropriate 
candidates for ASCVD preventive therapies while captur-
ing risk for broader CVD events.
Several limitations of the present study merit consid-
eration. First, this study was not designed to determine 
the optimal number or combination of the screening 
tests for risk stratification purposes. The number of 
potential combinations of the 5 tests is 120, and each 
potential combination could be considered for multiple 
end points. Second, the number of end points in the 
DHS was too low to perform multivariable adjustment 
for the tertiary end points. However, the adjusted re-
sults for the primary and secondary outcomes demon-
strated consistent results compared with MESA, as did 
unadjusted analyses for the tertiary end points. Last, 
we acknowledge that comparing strength of associa-
tion between the different tests presents challenges 
and can be influenced by the incidence of the different 
end points and distributions of the test results in the 
study cohorts.
The goal of our study was to evaluate prospectively 
a multimodality risk prediction strategy and replicate the 
findings in a second population-based dataset. We did 
not design our primary analyses to validate the MESA

multivariable models in DHS but rather to determine 
whether the scientific approach replicated in a second 
dataset. We did perform sensitivity analyses in which 
the MESA models were applied directly to the DHS. Al-
though the overall performance of the models was mod-
estly impacted (as would be expected), the improvement 
in model performance with the addition of the 5 tests 
was generally similar to the primary analysis approach 
in which the coefficients were derived in the DHS. The 
models from MESA were also less well calibrated when 
applied to DHS, particularly for the ASCVD end point, 
although calibration remained adequate. Additional pro-
spective validation is required before the multivariable 
models can be considered for clinical application.
Clinical Implications
Current consensus recommendations support only se-
lective additional testing beyond traditional cardiovascu-
lar risk factors.1,22 However, combinations of tests were 
not assessed in these guidelines, and the gradients of 
risk seen with the individual tests considered in these 
documents were not as large in magnitude as those 
seen with the multimodality risk score in the current 
study. Our robust findings support the potential value of 
a multimodality testing strategy using these markers in 
selected individuals in whom additional risk stratification 
is desired.
The multimodality testing strategy may help to indi-
vidualize and more efficiently target cardiovascular pre-
vention efforts in primary care. Although current preven-
tion guidelines recommend a risk-based approach only 
when implementing statin and aspirin therapy, the role 
for targeting therapy on the basis of risk in primary pre-
vention is likely to expand in the future. For example, 
the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) 
demonstrated that lowering blood pressure below cur-
rently recommended targets was associated with re-
duced rates of HF and all-cause mortality,8 end points 
that were predicted well by the tests studied here. The 
favorable effects of more aggressive blood pressure 
lowering in SPRINT were balanced by side effects and 
some safety concerns, and the resource implications 
of broad implementation of lower blood pressure tar-
gets would be substantial. In addition, a novel agent for 
the management of diabetes mellitus, empagliflozin,

recently demonstrated a 38% reduction in death from 
cardiovascular causes and 35% reduction in HF, with 
lesser impact on ASCVD end points.56 Targeting empagi-
flozin to patients at highest risk for death and HF events 
may be a prudent strategy given the high cost of the 
drug. Thus, an individualized, risk-based approach using 
traditional risk factors plus biomarkers may be appropri-
ate when determining blood pressure targets or imple-
menting newer therapies that favorably impact CVD end 
points beyond ASCVD.
The multimodality strategy could also facilitate target-
ing of global and disease-specific CVD prevention efforts 
as population health care becomes an increasing focus 
of healthcare delivery. For example, among individuals 
with a risk score of 0, global CVD risk was extremely 
low in both MESA and DHS (<3% over 10 years in each 
study), and this large group of individuals could be man-
aged with a low-intensity/low-cost approach. In contrast, 
higher scores clearly captured risk not recognized with 
traditional risk factor algorithms, as consistent results 
were seen even among individuals estimated to be at 
low risk with the pooled cohort equations. Individuals 
with scores ≥2, for example, represented ˂50% of MESA 
participants and 25% of the younger DHS cohort, yet 
accounted for 79% and 58% of global CVD events, re-
spectively. A tailored and incrementally more intensive 
approach to global CVD risk reduction would be appro-
priate for individuals with a greater number of abnormal 
test results. For example, higher risk individuals could be 
referred to lifestyle intervention programs, focusing on 
improving low fitness and obesity, which are important 
contributors to multiple components of the global CVD 
end point. Triage for cardiovascular specialist evalua-
tion may be considered for the highest risk individuals, 
a strategy recently evaluated for a biomarker screen-
ing program in primary care with promising preliminary 
results.57 Although each of the 5 tests is available clini-
cally and thus measurement is currently feasible, larger 
studies will be needed to validate the present findings 
and elucidate the optimal strategy for clinical implemen-
tation. Moreover, additional consideration of costs, both 
those directly related to the tests and those engendered 
by abnormal test results, would be necessary before 
implementation.

CONCLUSION
A novel multimodality CVD risk assessment strategy 
using the nonredundant markers of ECG-LVH, CAC, NT-
proBNP, hs-cTnT, and hs-CRP substantially improved 
global and atherosclerotic CVD risk stratification 
among individuals from the general population free 
from CVD at study entry. Additional study of preventive 
strategies incorporating these complementary tests is 
indicated.
