Abstract
Importance—Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be effective in aggressive 
forms of multiple sclerosis that failed to respond to standard therapies.
Objective—To evaluate long-term outcomes after autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation for treatment of multiple sclerosis.
Design, Setting and Participants—Data was collected in a multicenter observational 
retrospective cohort study. Eligibility criteria were having received autologous hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation for the treatment of multiple sclerosis during 1995–2006 and availability of a 
pre-specified minimum dataset, comprising the disease subtype at baseline; the expanded 
disability status scale (EDSS) score at baseline; information on the administered conditioning 
regimen and graft manipulation; and availability of at least one follow-up visit/report after 
transplantation. Last patient last visit was on July 1, 2012. To avoid biases, all eligible patients 
were included in the analysis regardless the duration of follow-up.
Exposures—Demographic, disease- and treatment-related exposures were considered as 
variables of interest. These included age, disease subtype, baseline EDSS score, number of 
previous disease modifying treatments, and intensity of transplantation conditioning regimen.
Main Outcomes and Measures—The primary outcomes were multiple sclerosis progression-
free survival and overall survival. The probabilities of progression-free and overall survival were 
calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression multivariate analysis models.
Results—Valid data was collected from 25 centers in 13 countries for 281 evaluable patients 
with median follow up of 6.6 years (range 0.2–16 y). The majority of patients had progressive 
forms of multiple sclerosis (78%). The median EDSS score prior to mobilization was 6.5 (range 
1.5–9.0). The five-year probability of EDSS progression free survival was 46% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 42–54 %) and overall survival was 93% (95% CI, 89–96 %). Factors associated with 
neurological progression post-transplantation were age (HR=1.03, 95% CI, 1.00–1.05), 
progressive vs. relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (HR=2.33, 95%CI, 1.27–4.28) and >2 
previous disease-modifying therapy (HR=1.65, 95%CI, 1.10–2.47). EDSS score was associated 
with worse overall survival (HR 2.03, 95%CI=1.40–2.95).

 Conclusions and Relevance—In this observational study of MS patients treated with 
autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, nearly half survived free from neurological 
progression for 5 years after transplantation. Younger age, relapsing multiple sclerosis, less prior 
immunotherapies and lower disability score were factors associated with better outcomes. The 
results support the rationale for further, randomized controlled studies of AHSCT for treatment of 
MS.
INTRODUCTION
Approximately 3 million people in the world have multiple sclerosis (MS). 1 MS typically 
presents in young adulthood and can cause severe neurological disability, a major socio-
economic burden 2. Patients with an aggressive course of MS often fail to respond to several 
lines of disease-modifying treatment and deteriorate within a few years.
Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) is being investigated as 
treatment for aggressive MS3. The rationale of this approach is to allow the use of high dose 
immunosuppressive therapy to abrogate the autoimmune inflammatory process. Infusion of 
autologous hematopoietic cells boosts bone marrow recovery and promotes immune 
reconstitution. The procedure has been shown to induce a degree of immune ‘resetting’ 4,5. 
The treatment goals are to arrest worsening of neurologic disability, induce a prolonged 
medication-free interval and potentially an improvement in neurological function. Early 
clinical trials established the proof of principle that AHSCT could induce disease remissions 
in patients with severe MS 6. More recent studies have shown that autologous AHSCT is 
effective at suppressing clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disease 
reactivations 7–9, can result in neurological improvement in patients with relapsing-remitting 
MS 7,8,10–12 and can halt all detectable CNS inflammatory activity for a prolonged period of 
time 13. However, outcome assessments in the majority of studies were limited to a relatively 
short follow-up, and longer-term outcomes have been reported only from small case 
series 14–16. It would therefore be important to examine in a large patient population the 
course of MS after AHSCT and the rates of risks and complications over longer term.
The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term outcomes in patients who underwent 
AHSCT for treatment of MS in a large multi-center cohort by analyzing progression-free 
survival, evolution of neurological disability, overall survival, transplant related mortality 
and late effects, including new autoimmune and malignant disorders; and to examine the 
association of demographic, MS disease- and treatment-related variables with the long-term 
outcomes.
METHODS
Study Design, Setting and Data Sources
This study was an observational retrospective cohort study on autologous AHSCT for 
treatment of MS and was performed through collaboration between the Center for 
International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) Autoimmune Disease 
Working Committee and the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Group (EBMT) 
Autoimmune Disease Working Party. The CIBMTR is a voluntary working group of more

 than 450 transplant centers worldwide that contribute detailed data on consecutive marrow 
transplants to a Statistical Center located at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee 
and at the National Marrow Donor Program Coordinating Center in Minneapolis.17 The 
EBMT is a non-profit organization comprising 640 transplant centers mainly from Europe. 
All transplant centers have been required to obtain written informed consent to report data to 
the CIBMTR and to the EBMT database in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration 1975. 
Institutional Review Board approval for data collection and use of data for research purposes 
was obtained locally by each center. Only fully anonymised data were transferred to the 
study database. Following review by the study Steering Committee, the study protocol 
(Supplementary Appendix 1) was approved by the CIBMTR and the EBMT Board in 
agreement with the rules for retrospective studies of both organisations. MS pre-transplant 
and follow-up data had been prospectively collected from participating transplant centers on 
disease specific forms, which were harmonized between the two registries.18 For the 
purposes of this study, all bone marrow transplantation centers that had reported at least one 
autologous AHSCT for MS to CIBMTR or EBMT between 1995 and 2006 were sent an 
invitation to participate in the study together with a protocol summary. The centers that 
agreed to participate were asked to identify a transplant physician and a neurologist to 
oversee all patient data for accuracy and completeness at each site. To better describe disease 
activity before and after transplant and extend the follow up for our study, additional data 
collection was undertaken retrospectively. To this end, the Study team developed a 
supplemental data collection form that was pre-populated with the previously reported data 
in order to facilitate additional data collection and concurrently verify the accuracy of 
existing information. The overall completeness of enrollment in our study, calculated as 
percentage of all the procedures reported to the two registries during the time period, was 
281/493 (57%). A CONSORT diagram of enrollment and screening of the potentially 
eligible cases in provided in eFigure 1). Our study is reported according to the STROBE 
guidelines (checklist in supplementary Appendix).
Patients and Treatments
For each case to be included in the study a minimum dataset was required, which comprised: 
the MS course classification at baseline (relapsing remitting, RR; primary- PP or secondary 
progressive, SP; progressive relapsing, PR); the expanded disability status scale (EDSS; 
ranging from 0 signifying no disability through 7 for wheelchair bound to 10 for death due 
to MS; see eTable 1 for a detailed description) score at baseline; information on the 
administered conditioning regimen and graft manipulation; and availability of at least one 
follow-up visit/report after transplantation. Mobilization of Peripheral Blood Stem Cells 
(PBSC) was carried out by the administration of a hematopoietic Growth Factor (GF), with 
or without chemotherapy; type of both GF and chemotherapy were sought. Manipulation of 
the graft aimed to reduce the content of immune cells was also requested. Conditioning 
regimens including either Busulphan or Total Body Irradiation (TBI) were classified as high 
intensity; regimens including Cyclophosphamide alone or associated to Anti-Thymocyte 
Globulin (ATG) or Fludarabine were classified as reduced intensity; all the others were 
considered as intermediate intensity.

 Study End Points
Progression-free survival was defined as survival in the absence of progression of MS. 
Progression of MS was defined clinically as an increase of 1 point in the Expanded 
Disability Status Scale (EDSS) confirmed at 12 months (0.5 points if baseline EDSS score 
was >=5.5) compared to the pre-treatment baseline. The pre-treatment baseline was defined 
as the last assessment before mobilization (for peripherally mobilized autologous grafts) or 
before immunosuppressive conditioning (for bone marrow autologous grafts). EDSS 
increases that were detected on the last visit and therefore cannot be confirmed were 
considered as events, according to a more conservative approach. A sensitivity analysis was 
run censoring these last visits events. Death by any cause was considered MS progression in 
this analysis. Overall survival was time to death by any cause. For all the patients who died 
after the AHSCT the cause of death was examined. Early deaths that occurred within 100 
days from transplant, which are considered treatment-related, were described separately. 
Surviving patients were censored at time of last follow-up. Information regarding the 
incidence of late effects was collected, including malignancies and secondary autoimmune 
diseases.
Statistical Analysis
Data collected from both the CIBMTR and EBMT were summarized in descriptive tables of 
demographic information of all the population. Continuous variables were reported as 
medians and ranges or means and standard deviations, while categorical variables were 
reported as absolute numbers and percent of total patients. The probability of progression-
free survival was calculated using the Life Table estimator and the overall survival was 
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier Estimator. A multivariate analysis assessing the 
association of baseline characteristics and transplant methodology on progression free and 
overall survival was run using Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for 
center. Proportionality of hazard was checked by plotting log-log transformation of the KM 
survival curve, namely, log-log(S(t)), versus time t for each level of covariates; the 
assumption of proportional hazard is tenable if the difference between the two log-log KM 
curves is constant over time.
Variables significantly associated with each outcome event at univariate analysis were 
included as covariate in the multivariate model, which selected the independent set of 
variables using a stepwise approach. For each patient having an EDSS assessment 1 year 
before and 1 year after transplant, the yearly EDSS changes pre and post-transplant were 
calculated. These changes were compared by a repeated measures analysis of variance with 
2 time points (change pre vs change post-transplant), including also disease type (relapsing 
vs progressive forms) and an interaction term (period by disease type) to evaluate whether 
the EDSS change pre and post-transplant was different between relapsing and progressive 
patients.
A Loess smoothing technique 19 was applied to describe the EDSS trend over time in 
relapsing and in progressive patients, for those subjects having EDSS date of assessment 
reported. The Loess technique is a non-parametric, graphical tool to fit a smooth curve to the 
points in a scatterplot, based on local weighted regression analyses 19.

 A two-sided significance level of 5% was used. We used R version 3.2 and SPSS version 19 
software for the analysis.
RESULTS
Patients Demographics and Procedures
Valid data was obtained for 281 patients. Demographic and clinical data at the time of 
AHSCT are summarized in Table 1. The median disease duration calculated from diagnosis 
of MS to AHSCT was 81 months (range 1–413). At the time of AHSCT, 171 patients (61%) 
had received 2 or more prior lines of disease-modifying treatment for MS. At the assessment 
preceding mobilization the most represented disease subtype was SPMS, contributing 186 of 
the 281 patients (66%), and the median EDSS score was 6.5 (range 1.5–9) indicating 
moderately advanced disability on average. A few differences existed in the subsets of 
patients reported to CIBMTR and EBMT reflecting different patient selection practices in 
the two groups of countries. Compared to the CIBMTR cohort, patients from the EBMT 
cohort were younger (median age 35 years vs. 40 years, p<0.001), had more often >2 lines 
of therapy prior to transplant (52% vs. 32%, p=0.002), had less patients in SP (61% vs. 
75 %, p=0.001), shorter time from diagnosis to transplant (median time of 77 months vs. 91 
months, p=0.04) and had a greater proportion of patients transplanted during the first half 
(1995–2000) of the 12-year period qualifying for inclusion in our study (42% vs. 22%, 
p<0.01). In total, however, two thirds of the patients underwent AHSCT during the second 
half (2001–06). Mobilisation, graft manipulation and conditioning regimens details are also 
summarized in Table 1. The proportions of patients who received high-, intermediate- and 
low-intensity conditioning regimens were evenly split (approximately one third each) in 
CIBMTR, whereas 89% of patients reported to EBMT received an intermediate intensity 
regimen (most commonly BEAM+ATG). The percentage of patients treated with high-
intensity regimens was higher in progressive (20%) than in relapsing (10%) patients 
(p=0.05). The median duration of follow-up post-AHSCT was 6.6 years (range 0.2–16).
Progression-free survival
Progression-free survival as assessed by EDSS was considered the primary neurological 
endpoint. Patients with yearly EDSS assessments post transplant enabling this analysis were 
239 (85%). MS progression-free survival in all evaluable patients was 46% at 5 years post-
AHSCT (CI 42–54%; Fig. 1A). Progression-free survival in the subgroup with relapsing MS 
was 82% at 3 years (95% CI 71–93%), 78% at 4 years (95% CI 66–91%) and 73% at 5 years 
post-AHSCT (95% CI 57–88%). Amongst patients with SPMS, the largest subgroup in our 
study (n=162), 33% (95% CI 24–42%) remained free from EDSS deterioration at 5 years 
post-AHSCT. When applying a Cox regression analysis, the assumption of proportional 
hazard was tenable. Factors associated with the risk of EDSS progression as identified by 
univariate Cox analysis were: age; progressive vs. relapsing phase/subtype of MS; and 
number of prior treatments (Table 2). The significance of these factors was confirmed at 
multivariate analysis (Table 2; Fig. 1B, C, D). Younger age and relapsing forms of MS were 
independently associated with better progression-free survival (Fig. 1B, C). There was no 
statistical difference in the risk of progression between PPMS patients and SPMS (HR=1.09, 
p=0.63)(Fig. 1C). Patients who had received 3 or more immune-suppressive/modulatory

 treatments had a higher probability of progression than those who received 1–2 treatments 
before AHSCT (Fig. 1D). The results did not change when the unconfirmed progressions on 
the last visits were considered censored observations.
EDSS change in the period preceding and after AHSCT
It was important to also consider the evolution of neurological disability in the patients 
before they underwent AHSCT and the information was available in a subset of patients in 
the cohort. There were 111 patients who met the minimum requirement for this evaluation 
consisting of availability of at least one EDSS score during the three years prior to as well as 
after AHSCT with the respective dates of assessment. In the evaluable subgroup, the mean 
EDSS increased by 0.94 points (95%CI= 0.77–1.11) during the 12 months preceding 
transplant, as compared to a mean decrease of −0.32 EDSS points (95%CI= −0.15, −0.49) in 
the 12 months following transplant (p<0.001). A test for interaction demonstrated that the 
evolution of EDSS change pre and post-transplant was significantly different between 
patients with relapsing MS [EDSS change 1 year pre-transplant = +1.42 (95%CI= 0.98–
1.86), EDSS change 1 year post-transplant = −0.76 (95%CI=−1. 08-0.34)] and progressive 
MS forms [EDSS change 1 year pre-transplant= +0.73 (95%CI= 0.59–0.87), EDSS change 1 
year post-transplant = −0.14 (95%CI=−0.28 - 0.01)] patients (p<0.001). Figure 2 shows the 
evolution of EDSS score recorded before and after AHSCT in the 111 patients, divided by 
disease course in relapsing (A) and progressive (B) MS types. This representation allows 
visualizing the rapid neurological deterioration occurring in both patient subgroups before 
AHSCT. Post-transplantation, the integrated line suggests a reduction of the rate of accrual 
of disability in the subgroup with relapsing MS (Figure 2A).
Overall survival
Overall survival was 93% (95% CI,=89–96%) at 5 years and 84% (95% CI= 78–89%) at 10 
years from transplant (Figure 3A). When applying a Cox regression analysis, the assumption 
of proportional hazard was tenable. Factors associated with worse overall survival at 
univariate Cox analysis were: age; baseline EDSS score; high vs. low intensity of the 
conditioning regimen; progressive vs. relapsing form of MS (Table 2). At multivariate 
analysis only a higher baseline EDSS score remained significantly associated with a higher 
risk of death over time with HR 2.03 per EDSS point (95%CI=1.40–2.95; Table 2). When 
stratifying by disability levels, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed worse survival in patients 
with baseline EDSS ≥ 7 (p = 0.004, Fig. 3B).
Mortality and late adverse events
Overall, 37 deaths from any cause (treatment related or not) out of 281 patients were 
reported during the entire follow-up. Eight deaths (2.8%, CI=1.0–4.9%) were reported 
within 100 days from transplant and were considered transplant related mortality. Data on 
factors associated with lower overall survival at univariate analysis are presented for the 
patients who died within and after day 100 post-transplant against the whole cohort in 
eTable 2. Among the patients who died during follow-up, progressive MS type and high 
intensity conditioning regimens were overrepresented compared to the frequency of these 
factors in the whole cohort. However, the small number of events precludes a formal

 statistical evaluation. Individual causes of death and details on previous immune 
suppressive/modulatory treatments for MS are provided in eTable 3.
Late adverse events including the new onset of malignancies and autoimmune diseases are 
reported in eTable 4. Additionally, one case of Monoclonal Gammopathy of Unknown 
Significance (MGUS) was reported. Of the 3 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome two 
received a total body irradiation-based regimen and the other received cyclophosphamide
+ATG. In the small number of events occurred, there was no clear evidence to suggest 
association of any of the late events with specific treatment regimens.
DISCUSSION
Previous studies of AHSCT for treatment of MS often reported detailed assessments, some 
including MRI endpoints, yet most had relatively short duration of follow-up: for example in 
the largest published prospective study (n = 145) median follow-up was 2 years11. The few 
studies with truly long-term follow-up (i.e. including outcomes at 5 years) included small 
numbers of patients, the largest reporting on 35 patients over a median follow-up period of 
11 years 15. We analyzed a large cohort of patients undergoing AHSCT for treatment of MS 
(n = 281) over long term (median follow up of 6.6 years). Compared to the largest 
previously published cohort (Burt et al11) that included 118 RRMS (81.4%) and 27 SPMS 
patients (18.6%) our study includes a different proportion of MS types where 63 patients had 
relapsing types (RRMS and PRMS totaling 22.4%) and 218 had progressive types (PPMS 
and SPMS totaling 77.5%), thus it provides more information on outcomes after AHSCT in 
progressive MS, an area of unmet need20. Burt and colleagues noted that their criteria 
selecting patients with active inflammation and excluding those with late secondary-
progressive MS may have prevented them from detecting associations that may exist with 
baseline EDSS score, older age, or prior number of immune-modulation or suppression 
regimens with a worse outcome11. In our study, not imposing any criteria to select a disease 
phenotype enabled us to demonstrate significant associations of these factors with worse 
outcomes. Lastly, all previous studies focused on specific AHSCT protocols utilized at those 
centers whereas in our study, for the first time to our knowledge in a long-term cohort, we 
report outcomes after a wide range of regimens, including low- (17%), intermediate- (64%) 
and high-intensity regimens (19%) and include conditioning intensity as a variable in the 
statistical analyses.
Our primary neurological outcome was progression-free survival, as assessed by systematic 
EDSS neurological disability scoring. In our cohort 78% of patients had PP- or SPMS and 
the observed progression-free survival in the evaluable patients (239/281, 85%) was 46% at 
5-year follow-up. Because long-term stability of neurological disability is not an expected 
feature of the natural course of aggressive forms of relapsing or progressive MS21 these data 
raise the possibility that AHSCT may have reduced the risk of progression in the treated 
patients, yet in the absence of a control group demonstration is lacking. Neurological 
outcomes in our study, however were considerably better in patients with relapsing- than in 
those with progressive MS, consistent with recent evidence of good efficacy in RRMS7,11. 
By using multivariate analysis we identified relapsing MS as a factor robustly associated 
with progression-free survival (HR=2.33), which remained >70% at 5 years post-AHSCT in

 this patient subgroup. In the report by Burt et al, 81.4% of the patients had RRMS and 
progression-free survival was 87% at 4 years 11. In the HALT-MS trial patients were all 
RRMS by inclusion criteria and progression-free survival was 90.9% at 3 years 7. Inclusion 
criteria selecting patients with early RRMS may explain the higher progression-free rates 
observed in those studies. Additional factors that were significantly associated with better 
progression-free survival in our study were younger age and less than 3 prior MS disease-
modifying treatments. Some of the previous studies considered age in subgroup analyses22 
but none to our knowledge demonstrated their significance through formal statistical 
evaluation. Furthermore, we analyzed in a subset of evaluable patients the trajectory of 
neurological disability as measured by EDSS during the periods preceding and following 
AHSCT. The mean accumulation of disability during the 12 months pre-transplant (+0.94 
EDSS points) was partially reversed post-transplant (−0.32 EDSS points) and the reversal 
was significantly greater in the patients with the relapsing compared to the progressive MS 
forms. This comparison extends previous observations of improvements in EDSS scores 
after AHSCT in studies including predominantly or exclusively RRMS patients 7,8,10,11 and 
in the subgroup of patients with RRMS of the Italian AHSCT database 12.
We also examined the association of variables with overall survival. Univariate analysis 
identified age, baseline EDSS score, intensity of the conditioning regimen and progressive 
vs. relapsing form of MS as factors significantly associated with lower overall survival rate. 
Of these, only baseline EDSS score was confirmed as significant in multivariate analysis, 
with a HR=2 per EDSS point. However, the low rate of events limits the power to detect at 
multivariate analysis all the variables underlying mortality and we cannot conclude that 
factors like conditioning intensity or disease stage do not affect survival.
Transplant-related death is a major concern in a non-immediately life-threatening disease 
such as MS. In the present study the 100-day mortality, which in hematological practice is 
considered a surrogate of transplant related mortality, was 2.8%, a high rate that likely 
reflects the early AHSCT experience captured in our study that only included transplants 
performed until 31/12/2006. Indeed, a retrospective analysis of the EBMT Registry 
performed in 2007 reported a decrease of treatment-related mortality from 7.3% to 1.3% in 
transplants for MS carried out before and after the year 2000, respectively3. In a 2010 
update23, the 100-day mortality in the whole Registry was 2%, half of that in the 2005 report 
(4%)24. The reduction over the years is likely related to improved selection of patients with 
the exclusion of patients with advanced disability who are at higher risk of complications, 
and to the less frequent use of intensive conditioning regimens 22. In our study the causes of 
deaths within day 100 were partly related to the immunosuppression, as expected 22 
although the small number of events prevents a reliable analysis. Beyond day 100, the 
incidence of death is scattered throughout the follow-up (Fig. 3 and data not shown) and the 
causes can be attributed in large part to progression of MS disability and its attendant 
complications, which often include infection even in patients who have not been treated with 
immunosuppressant therapies. The conditioning regimen was more frequently a high-
intensity one in the patients who died during follow-up than in the whole cohort, yet non-
random allocation of treatment and small numbers prevent us from making definitive 
conclusions about this association.

 The analysis of late events included malignancies and new onset of autoimmune disease. 
With regard to malignancies, 3 patients (1%) were reported with a myelodysplastic 
syndrome, a disorder associated with prior treatment with cytotoxic drugs; the other 
neoplasms reported in this cohort are usually not associated to previous chemotherapy. The 
incidence of new autoimmune disease was not negligible (5%), in line with a survey recently 
carried out by EBMT 25, yet considerably lower than after lymphocyte-depleting treatment 
with alemtuzumab that approaches a risk of 50%26.
The main limitation of our study is its partially retrospective nature. Although some of the 
data was collected retrospectively from clinical records, we took many steps to optimize the 
analysis. As most database studies, the reported outcomes mirror the practice for MS 
treatment in many countries. EDSS assessments were not rater-blinded and not 
systematically performed for the duration of follow-up in every patient, thus we limited the 
analysis of progression-free survival to the large subset of patients (85%) who had yearly 
EDSS rating. The number of patients with enough data points for the different analyses was 
variable and sometimes low, which reduced statistical power. In a retrospective study 
incomplete reporting and loss to follow-up may result in underestimating the frequency of 
late adverse events. We also acknowledge the limitation that although our analysis includes 
the majority (57%) of the transplants registered with CIBMTR and EBMT during the time 
period, more than one third of the activity was not captured by our study. However, the 
reason for 166/212 (78%) of the unavailable cases was that the centers where the patients 
were treated declined to participate in the study; 43 (74%) out of 58 centers which did not 
join the study had performed less than 3 transplants and lack of incentive for the clinicians to 
contributing few cases to a large study was stated in many centers’ responses. Based on this 
information we do not expect that the unavailability of those cases could represent a 
significant source of bias.
In summary, in this large observational cohort of MS patients with predominantly 
progressive forms of MS treated with AHSCT and followed long-term, almost half survived 
free from neurological progression for 5 years after transplantation. Taken together, the 
multivariate statistics indicate that the profile of a patient who is more likely to survive free 
from neurological progression is that of a younger subject with relapsing MS who has failed 
no more than two disease-modifying treatments and has not reached high levels of disability. 
These associations strengthen the case for an evaluation of safety and efficacy of AHSCT in 
a randomized controlled trial against approved therapies of high efficacy as first- or second 
line of treatment in patients with highly active relapsing MS, as suggested by experts’ 
consensus 27. Furthermore, our results raise the question whether AHSCT may attenuate the 
progression of disability in patients with progressive forms of MS, a possibility that is more 
plausible in patients with MRI evidence of CNS inflammatory activity pre-transplant 8,12,15 
and that could be addressed in a randomized trial of AHSCT controlled against standard 
care.

 Key Points
Question
What are the long-term outcomes following autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation for treatment of multiple sclerosis?
Findings
In this multicenter observational retrospective cohort study of 281 patients with 
predominantly (78%) progressive forms of multiple sclerosis who underwent autologous 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation during 1995–2006, transplant-related mortality 
was 2.8% and neurological progression-free survival was 46% at 5 years. Relapsing 
multiple sclerosis, younger age, less prior immunotherapies and lower neurological 
disability score were significantly associated with better outcomes.
Meaning
The results support the rationale for further, randomized controlled studies of autologous 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for treatment of multiple sclerosis.

 Figure 1. MS progression-free survival
Probabilities of EDSS progression-free survival after AHSCT are shown by Kaplan-Meier 
analysis (A) in the whole patient cohort and in subgroups stratified according to the factors 
identified by multivariate analysis as affecting progression-free survival, respectively: (B) in 
quartiles according to age (p = 0.022 for trend); (C) in patients with relapsing-remitting 
(RR), secondary progressive (SP) and primary progressive (PP) forms of MS (p = 0.007 for 
heterogeneity); and (D) in patients who received 1–2 or 3 previous disease-modifying 
treatments (p= 0.008 for heterogeneity). The different shades of grey represent 95% 
Confidence Intervals for each K-M line.

 Figure 2. Evolution of EDSS scores before and after AHSCT in relapsing and progressive MS
The individual (colored dotted) and integrated (solid black) lines depict the evolution of 
EDSS scores in the subset of patients who had both longitudinal pre-transplantation and 
post-transplant EDSS data and the date of EDSS assessment documented (n =111). These 
are subdivided in relapsing (A; n = 32) and progressive (B; n = 79) forms of MS at the time 
of transplant. Rapid worsening of disability was observed prior to transplant in both 
subgroups, as expected for patients with aggressive forms of MS who were selected for 
AHSCT. The integrated line suggests that on average the accrual of disability was stopped in 
relapsing MS patients during the first 2 years post-transplant.

 Figure 3. Overall survival
The probability of survival after AHSCT is shown as Kaplan-Meier analysis in the whole 
patient cohort (A). Since higher baseline EDSS score was found by multivariate analysis to 
be independently associated with worse survival (see Table 2 for details) we show in (B) the 
probabilities of survival after AHSCT in three strata of patients with different levels of 
disability at baseline assessment (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS brackets: 0–5.5; 
6–6.5; ≥7), which differed significantly for the highest EDSS bracket (p = 0.004 for 
heterogeneity). The grey shades represent 95% Confidence Intervals for each K-M line.
