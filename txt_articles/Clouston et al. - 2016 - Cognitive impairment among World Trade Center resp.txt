Abstract
Introduction: During the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks, responders who helped in search,
rescue, and recovery endured multiple traumatic and toxic exposures. One-fifth subsequently devel-
oped post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD has been linked to dementia in veterans. This
study examined the association between WTC-related PTSD and cognitive impairment (CI) in
WTC responders.
Methods: A one-third sample of responders (N 5 818) reporting for annual monitoring visits were
screened for cognitive impairment and dementia using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment from
January 2014–April 2015. Concurrent diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder (MDD),
as well as serial PTSD and depressive symptom inventories, collected since 2002, were examined
in relation to current CI.
Results: Approximately 12.8% and 1.2% of responders in this sample respectively had scores indic-
ative of CI and possible dementia. Current PTSD and MDD were associated with CI. Longitudinal
results revealed that re-experiencing symptoms were consistently associated with CI (aRR 5 2.88,
95% confidence interval 5 1.35–6.22), whereas longitudinal increases in other PTSD and depressive
symptoms in the years before screening were evident only among those with CI.
Conclusions: Analyses replicated results from Veterans studies and further highlighted the impor-
tance of re-experiencing symptoms, a major component of PTSD that was consistently predictive
of CI 14 years later. Clinicians should monitor CI when treating individuals with chronic PTSD.

Dementia is a degenerative disease of the brain that is ex-
pected to affect as many as 40% of the U.S. population
[1,2]. Although dementia is an uncommonly devastating
disease, milder prodromal forms of cognitive impairment
(CI) are more common and also implicate substantial
losses in cognitive functioning [3]. Risk factors for CI and
dementia include age, smoking, alcohol intake, cardiovascu-
lar
disease,
education,
diabetes,
and
depression
[4].
Research
suggests
that
post-traumatic
stress
disorder
(PTSD) may also be associated with reduced cognitive func-
tioning and increased risk of dementia [5,6]. PTSD involves
complex memory, emotional, and behavioral processes [7],

 and
encompasses
distinct
domains
including
re-
experiencing, effortful avoidance, emotional numbing, and
hyperarousal resulting from a traumatic event [8]. Exact
mechanisms for this association remain understudied [9].
Theories suggest, on the one hand, that PTSD may be a
unique part of the causal pathway leading to CI [10]. How-
ever, the association may be confounded by co-morbid fea-
tures that are independently associated with PTSD and
dementia, such as traumatic brain injury [11]. Finally, symp-
toms indicative of PTSD, which is commonly comorbid with
major depressive disorder (MDD) [12], may be manifesta-
tions of CI and dementia [13]. It is thus unclear whether re-
ported
associations
between
PTSD
and
cognitive
impairments and dementia are due to reverse causation.
1.1. Setting
Thousands of responders who helped in search, rescue,
and cleanup efforts after the World Trade Center (WTC)
were exposed to an extraordinary array of psychological
traumas and toxic exposures. Although few were physically
injured by their efforts, many responders witnessed the
disaster or death and dismemberment of others, helped civil-
ians flee, lost colleagues in the tower collapse, and dug
through debris to search for survivors [14]. Since then, re-
searchers examining WTC responders have found high rates
of chronic PTSD. Yet, the potential effects of persistent
mental health symptoms on CI have not been examined [15].
2. Hypotheses
Based on existing studies, we hypothesized that current
WTC-PTSD will be associated with CI. Dementia re-
searchers largely agree that CI is generally characterized
as undergoing a period of accelerated decline before
becoming diagnostic (Fig. 1A) [16,17]. We posited that
such change might also be observed in noncognitive
outcomes, such as via increasing depressive symptoms
(dashed line), in a way similar to cognitive outcomes.
Thus, longitudinal analyses of depressive and PTSD
symptoms before cognitive screening may help interpret
concurrent associations. Specifically, changes in related
noncognitive factors could be used to help mark the course
of the disease. If so, then reverse causation would be
evident
by
significantly
increasing
symptoms
before
screening positive for CI. In contrast, risk factors may be
those that, alternatively, precede the course of the disease
and/or are not subject to such reverse causal effects.
3. Methods
3.1. Parent monitoring study
In July 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion initiated a monitoring and treatment program for WTC
responders, spanning five clinical centers. Since then, more
than 33,000 responders have enrolled in the WTC Health
Program and form the WTC general responders cohort
[14]. Stony Brook University (SBU) runs the second largest
clinical center, monitoring .8000 responders residing on
Long Island, NY. SBU’s population had similar exposures
to the general responder cohort and was similar in age on
9/11/2001 (38.7 in the WTC general responder cohort versus
38.4 at SBU) [14]. However, the SBU population includes
relatively more law enforcement personnel and men and
fewer individuals without a high-school degree. The SBU
Institutional Review Board approved this study, and re-
sponders provided written informed consent; .95% of re-
sponders consented for data to be used for research purposes.
3.2. Sample
Trained clinicians screened responders for CI during
monitoring visits at the SBU clinics starting in 2014. Of
those approached, 89.8% completed the screening, 0.6%
did not complete due to extenuating circumstances, 0.4%
only finished part of the screening, and 8.7% refused to
participate in this cognitive screening. Those who refused

Enrollment is open, and some patients have left. WTC exposures precede
data collection, but mental health symptoms have been gathered since
2002, and diagnoses and cognitive screening were done concurrently in
2014–2015.

 testing did not differ in terms of PTSD (P 5.165), WTC ex-
posures (P 5 .940), educational attainment (P 5 .580), or
law enforcement status (P 5 .105) from those who
completed testing. On average, SBU responders were aged
52.8 years when this sample was taken. A total of 818
Responders with valid diagnostic information were eligible
for this study. To assess exclusion bias, 128 responders
screened using a different PTSD diagnostic tool were also
screened for CI. Data were linked to existing monitoring re-
cords that included PTSD and depressive symptoms
measured obtained serially since baseline (Fig. 1B). Five
responders who reported any head injury obtained on-site
were excluded, leaving an analytic sample of 813 re-
sponders. Clinic visit date was recorded.
3.3. Assessments
3.3.1. Cognitive impairment
Trained clinicians administered the Montreal Cognitive
Assessment (MoCA) starting February 2014. The MoCA
consists of multiple short-form neuropsychological tests
that are scored in a standard way. A relatively conservative
cutoff score of ,23 was used to indicate CI, and a score
of ,18 was used to suggest possible dementia. These cutoffs
have been shown to have .95% sensitivity and specificity in
community-dwelling older adults [18]. Presence of the
apolipoprotein-ε4 (APOE) has been strongly associated
with the risk for Alzheimer’s disease [19]. APOE status
was measured using polymerase chain reaction on blood
banked in a subsample of these responders (n 5 593).
3.3.2. Diagnoses of PTSD and MDD
Trained psychologists administered the Structured Clin-
ical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders-IV to diagnose both PTSD and MDD
[20]. Inter-rater agreement was high (k 5 0.82) among 55 in-
dependent ratings. To facilitate rapport and interpretation,
interviewers were tasked with reviewing participant’s his-
tories before assessments. The PTSD module used WTC ex-
posures as the index trauma. Both current (i.e., active in the
past month) and remitted (i.e., not active in the past month)
diagnoses were analyzed. Treatment for PTSD is freely
available in the clinic to responders in need; 70.8% of those
categorized as having current PTSD and 43.3% of those with
remitted PTSD received treatment for PTSD.
3.3.3. Longitudinal PTSD and depressive symptoms
measures
PTSD symptoms were assessed at each monitoring visit us-
ing the PTSD checklist, specific trauma version tailored to the
WTC disaster (PCL-17 trauma specific version) [21]. Individ-
uals rated the extent to which they were bothered by 17 DSM-
IV WTC-related PTSD symptoms in the past month on a scale
from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). Items were summed within
four PTSD symptom dimensions consistent with four-factor
models of PTSD dimensionality [8]: re-experiencing the
event (e.g., flashbacks/nightmares), effortful avoidance (e.g.,
actively avoiding reminders), emotional numbing (e.g.,
emotionally distancing from life), and hyperarousal (e.g., be-
ing ever aware and on edge). Depressive symptoms were
measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)
[22]. PHQ-9 items, rated on a scale from 0–3 over the past 2
weeks, were summed in a standard way to provide a total
score. For comparative purposes, both scales were transformed
to range from 0 (no symptomatology) to 1 (maximal observed
symptomatology). Baseline symptomatology refers to symp-
tomatology collected during a responder’s first clinic visit.
3.4. Covariates
Predisposing characteristics were included. Education im-
proves cognitive reserve [23]; because .98% of responders
had at least a high-school degree, education were categorized
into those with some college, those completing a bachelor’s
degree, versus those with less education. Occupation was
dichotomized into law enforcement (the majority at SBU)
versus nontraditional responders (e.g., construction or utility
workers). Pre-WTC PTSD was assessed using the SCID.
Pre-WTC history of head injury was coded as none, previous
loss of consciousness, concussion, or multiple head injuries.
Trauma severity was assessed at enrollment using a struc-
tured history. Two measures of exposure were included:
early arrival (arrived on 9/11 and were caught in the dust
cloud or saw human remains) and chronic exposure (re-
sponders who worked at least 7 days in September 2001 dig-
ging through debris).
PTSD might impact cognition through impaired health
and health behaviors [24]. Five indicators were included:
smoking status; hazardous drinking (Alcohol Use Disorder
Identification Test �8) [25]; obesity, operationalized as
objectively measured body mass index .30; and diagnosed
hypertension or diabetes [26]. Analyses also include WTC-
related conditions including upper respiratory disease, lower
respiratory disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
3.5. Statistical analysis
3.5.1. Descriptive analyses
Descriptive sample statistics provide means and standard
deviations, as well as percentages. Sample characteristics
were also reported separately for those with and without
CI. T tests were used to compare continuous variables be-
tween groups; c2 tests were used to provide P values for
dichotomous predictors.
PTSD/MDD symptom growth could be interpreted as
indicative of reverse causation resulting from early noncog-
nitive changes in mental health accompanying CI and may
thus help us to chart the course of the disease and identify
whether PTSD preceded or may have resulted from CI. As-
sociations that are consistent and predate such reverse
S.A.P. Clouston et al. / Alzheimer’
s & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring 4 (2016) 67-75
69
 causation may then be interpretable as risk factors for CI.
Descriptive analyses thus examined trajectories of symptom
change for responders with and without current CI. Longitu-
dinal multivariate models were used to examine symptom
change leading up to cognitive assessments [27]. Models in-
tegrated individual-level random intercepts to account for
unobserved heterogeneity in baseline symptomatology.
Random slopes estimate individual-specific growth and ac-
count for heteroskedasticity common in growth models
[28]. Enrollment date was used to model temporal change
in sample selection; temporal metrics were centered in the
observational window. Using an unstructured covariance,
matrix further accounted for associations between baseline
capability and change over time. To facilitate comprehen-
sion, graphical trajectories were provided. The 813 re-
sponders provided 7.24 (SD 5 2.95) person-years of data
collected during 3995 clinic visits from 2002–2014. Ana-
lyses were implemented in Stata 14.1/IC.
3.5.2. Multivariable analyses
Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the
potential for diagnoses of PTSD and MDD to predict CI, and
subdomains of PTSD identified as robust to reverse causation
in predicting CI. The risk of CI was not rare in this sample so
odds ratios will overestimate the relative risk. Multivariable-
adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) were derived from logistic regres-
sion using the Muller and MacLehose [29] risk ratio.
3.5.3. Sensitivity analyses
Law enforcement officers differ from other responders with
respect to exposures, extent of disaster training, and burden of
PTSD. Similarly, those with pre-WTC head injuries may differ
from those without. Analyses were stratified to examine
whether results differed across these subpopulations; Chow
test was used to test whether differences were significant. For
clarity, analyses further examined whether excluding individ-
uals enrolled in the study after 2010 modified results. Longitu-
dinal analyses also examined any changes to conclusions when
modifying distributional assumptions, including examining
negative binomial, ordinal, and logistic regression specifica-
tions. Similarly, analyses examined whether conclusions drawn
from trajectory analyses changed when limited to individuals
with at least three observations. Analyses examined whether
excluding those screening positive for possible dementia
(MoCA,18) changed conclusions, and further multinomial lo-
gistic regression was used to jointly examine conclusions pre-
dicting both CI and dementia. Because treatment may
provide a mechanism through which PTSD affects CI, analyses
examined whether treatment for PTSD-mediated results.
4. Results
4.1. Sample characteristics
As shown in Table 1, 104 of 813 (12.8%) responders had
any CI, of whom 10 (1.2% of 813) had probable dementia.
Bivariable analyses (Table 1) showed that responders with
CI had lower education, nontraditional occupations, older
age and were more likely to be current smokers than those
without CI. Current WTC-PTSD and MDD were both asso-
ciated with CI, as was receiving treatment for PTSD.
4.2. Diagnostic results
Diagnoses were associated with CI after accounting for
covariates. Indeed, Table 2 revealed that current PTSD re-
mained significantly associated with CI after adjusting for
predisposing, WTC exposures, and for health and behavioral
mediators (model 1). Adjusted analyses also found that cur-
rent MDD remained associated with CI (model 2).
4.3. Longitudinal symptomatology
The lack of association between current, but not remitted,
diagnoses might be indicative of a potential for longitudinal
symptom growth. Indeed, longitudinal analyses (Fig. 2B–E)
suggested that baseline levels of avoidance, hyperarousal,
numbing, and depressive symptoms were not associated
with CI. Instead, longitudinal analyses revealed that

 symptoms increased more rapidly (by w0.9%/year) among
responders with current CI. In contrast, for re-experiencing
symptoms, longitudinal analyses suggest consistent associa-
tions with CI beginning as early as 2002 that did not change
with time (Fig. 2A).
4.4. Re-experiencing symptoms
Because
longitudinal
analyses
indicated
that
re-
experiencing symptom severity may be a risk factor for CI,
adjusted analyses were used to examine the robustness of
this domain in predicting CI (Table 3). Re-experiencing
symptom severity ranged from 0 to 1 and average 0.17
(SD 5 0.20) in general and ranged from 0.16 (SD 5 0.19)
in those not screening positive for CI to 0.23 (SD 5 0.23)
among those who screened positive for CI. Adjusting for pre-
disposing factors (model 1) showed a significant association
between age and CI. Accounting for WTC exposures (model
2) and for health factors including treatment for PTSD and
baseline depressive symptoms (Model 3) did not improve
model fit (model 2, P 5 .654; model 3, P 5 .406). Notably,
baseline re-experiencing symptom severity predicted diag-
noses of remitted and current PTSD and MDD (eTable 2).
4.5. Sensitivity analyses
Bivariate analyses showed no association between enroll-
ment year and the odds of CI, and longitudinal analyses show
no association between enrollment year and PTSD. Strati-
fying analyses by enrollment year, law enforcement status,
head injury status, and omitting those with possible dementia
did not alter conclusions. Further stratifying by age of
responder provided similar results. Multinomial logistic
regression results adjusting for age rely on small numbers
(eTable 3) but revealed strong independent associations
between
re-experiencing
and
both
CI
(RR
5
3.94
[1.53–10.17]) and dementia (RR 5 17.45 [1.10–275.69]).
Longitudinal results were robust using different distributional
assumptions. Examining exclusion bias, prevalence in a sam-
ple of responders who were ineligible for this study (n 5 128)
showed similar prevalence of CI (12.5% vs. 12.8% above, dif-
ference 5 0.3%, P 5.925). APOE ε4/ε4 was associated with
increased risk of possible dementia (RR 5 9.68 [1.13–
83.11]). Adjusting for medications did not decrease the size
of the association between diagnosed PTSD and CI (to 1.83
from 1.92) but attenuated its significance.
5. Discussion
This study examined the extent of CI among WTC re-
sponders and associations between CI and WTC-PTSD/MDD
in a sample of 813 WTC responders without WTC-related
head injury. Approximately one in seven (12.8%) of sampled
SBU WTC responders screened positive with CI, whereas
1.2% had possible dementia. If representative of actual preva-
lence of CI in the general responder cohort (Nw33,000) [14],
results may translate into 3740–5300 and 240–810 with CI
and dementia respectively in that patient population. These
numbers are staggering, considering that the average age of
responders was 53 during this study. Future research is needed
to diagnose, and clarify determinants of, CI in this population.
Current, but not remitted, WTC-PTSD and MDD were
associated with a two-fold increase in CI. Longitudinal ana-
lyses highlight growth in a number of symptom domains,
including avoidance, numbing, hyperarousal, and depressive
symptoms among those who later screen positive for CI.
Such growth may indicate early manifestations of CI. Strik-
ingly, analyses suggested that re-experiencing symptoms
were consistently associated with CI (aRR 5 2.88, 95%
CI 5 1.35–6.22), irrespective of observational period. To
our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the associ-
ation of PTSD and MDD with CI and to do so in a civilian
sample of WTC responders without concurrent head trauma.
5.1. Limitations
Results require validation using comprehensive batteries
of cognition and diagnostic evaluations by a trained clinician
to diagnose the cause of CI found here to ensure that WTC-
CI is not a unique disease and that discussed are not spurious.
Such analyses should start by examining domain-specific
factors and longitudinal declines in cognitive functioning.
Although CI and dementia were associated with APOE
status, replicating earlier analyses [19], APOE was not
associated with risk of PTSD in these data nor did APOE
status modify the association between exposure and PTSD.
Results are limited to participants who were selected for
screening, and this study does not inform us about the rela-
tive risk of WTC responders to other individuals with similar
occupational exposures. Although a separate sample of SBU
responders who were ineligible for this study revealed
similar prevalence (12.5% with CI), efforts may seek to
improve generalizability by gathering prospective data
from cognitively normal WTC responders and from nonex-
posed controls to determine incidence of CI. Finally,
although four WTC responders with WTC-related head

history of head trauma including loss of consciousness or
concussion often due to sports injuries or car accidents.
Although no significant association was found linking
head injuries and CI, future research should explore whether
specific aspects of prior head injury (e.g., age of first occur-
rence, number of injuries) may modify the relationship be-
tween PTSD and CI.

 5.2. Aging
Traumatic stress can arise from various sources ranging
from natural and human-made disasters to interpersonal
traumas. Approximately 5%–10% of individuals exposed
to trauma develop chronic PTSD [30]. In a primary care
sample aged 65 years and older, 24% reported some lifetime
trauma, and one third of them (8% of patients) had symp-
toms consistent with PTSD [31]. Few studies of survivors
of, or responders to, disasters have considered the potential
impact of PTSD on CI and the reverse [15]. Indeed, a lone
longitudinal study of PTSD symptom change in relation to
memory (n 5 28) found inconsistent results [32], although
a large study of veterans found that PTSD was associated
with a two-fold increase in the risk of incident dementia
[33]. The present study revealed that experiencing trauma re-
sulting in PTSD is associated with increased risk of CI,
thereby extending results from Veterans studies to a civilian
sample while highlighting the importance of monitoring
cognitive functioning in traumatized populations.
5.3. Neurodegeneration
Dementia results from several causes including neurodegen-
eration resulting in CI [34]. The prodromal period is usually
characterized by accelerated cognitive aging, which can last a
decade [35], and increasing levels of CI in the years before
becoming diagnostic for dementia [16]. Milder forms of CI
are the largest risk factor for incident dementia and are thus
often called prodromal [34,36]. The prodromal period can be
accompanied by noncognitive behavioral and emotional
changes [37]. For example, one prospective study of incident
dementia found that the risk of depression increased among
previously nondepressed respondents during the prodromal
period suggesting that depression has the potential to act as
an early manifestation or risk indicator of dementia [38]. Our
study analyzed changes in PTSD and depressive symptoms
measured routinely across over a decade before cognitive
screening and found that depressive and many PTSD symp-
toms were no different in 2002 between those with and without
CI and increased only in those who later screened positive for
CI. Yet, whereas results for most symptom domains suggested
that changes in PTSD and depressive symptoms may be part of
the prodrome of CI, associations between re-experiencing
symptoms and CI uniquely lead to a different set of conclu-
sions, namely that they preceded the onset of CI and were
not subject to reverse causation.
5.4. Post-traumatic stress disorder
Common treatments for PTSD include cognitive behavioral
therapy and pharmacological treatments, notably selective se-

are not evident with common PTSD treatments [40]. Moreover,

noting
the
importance
of
re-experiencing symptoms as an early marker of mental pathol-
ogy [7]. Intrusive re-experiencing symptoms are the embodi-
ment of a neurological flash bulb memory processes, which
can be triggered by stressful events and tend to remain consis-
tent for many individuals [41] that are a foundational element
of chronic PTSD. Re-experiencing symptoms occur when indi-
viduals react physically and emotionally to memories of past
trauma that intrude during daily activities and while asleep.
Sleep disturbances are fundamental to PTSD [42], may exacer-
bate allostatic load [43], and have been linked to incident de-
mentia [44]. However, intrusive stress while awake has also
been previously associated with poorer episodic memory [45]
and poorer fluid cognition [46], potentially highlighting the
central importance of cognitive interference to CI.
Evidence linking such complex memory and behavioral
processes to CI could be interpreted in several ways. Re-
experiencing traumatic events could cause CI, possibly
through a number of plausible biological mechanisms
including increased allostatic load [10]. If so, efforts to pre-
vent or treat PTSD may have long-term benefits. Re-
experiencing symptoms may be part of the PTSD syndrome,
with chronic PTSD linked to risk of CI, in which case diag-
nostic efforts may benefit from cognitive screening. Alterna-
tively, those at risk of re-experiencing the event may be
similarly vulnerable to CI in some unobserved fashion.
Further research is needed to examine whether broken sleep
cycles are a mechanism linking PTSD to CI.
5.5. Clinical implications
Clinicians should be aware of the potential for CI among
individuals with PTSD, and may want to monitor patients for

NOTE. Results presented as RR (95% CI). Model 1 accounts for variables
shown along with predisposing factors including sex, law enforcement,
educational attainment, head injury, and pre-WTC PTSD. Model 2 further
accounts for trauma severity. Model 3 additionally accounts for contempo-
rary health and health behaviors, baseline depressive symptoms, and having
ever received treatment for PTSD.

 complications due to CI. For example, CI may compound the
course of PTSD and depression, impairing the patient
beyond the impact of PTSD itself. Second, as found here,
CI may result in increased PTSD symptom severity. Further-
more, CI implies reduced ability to comply with therapeutic
regimes and self-manage chronic disease. Thus, clinicians
should be alert to CI when caring for traumatized patients
and when making decisions about treatment schedules.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematicreview:Priorsystematicreviewshavenoted
a relationship between post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) and lowered cognition as well as increased risk
of dementia and in traumatized populations.
2. Interpretation:
Associations
between
cognitive
impairment (CI) and PTSD were replicated in a
non-military WTC-exposed population without any
9/11-related head injury. Strikingly, re-experiencing
symptoms as early as 2002 were associated with CI
in 2014. In contrast, emotional and behavioral do-
mains of PTSD have increased drastically since 2002
among those with CI versus those without CI.
3. Future directions: The article proposes a guide for
clarifying temporality of noncognitive symptoms of
CI. Insofar as results replicate, clinicians should be
aware of CI when caring for traumatized populations.
Future research should seek to diagnose the cause of
CI in this sample, identify whether prevalence of CI
is higher in this sample than non-WTC-exposed
controls, and further delineate impacted domains of
cognitive functioning.
