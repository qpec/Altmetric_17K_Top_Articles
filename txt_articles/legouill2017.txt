BACKGROUND
Mantle-cell lymphoma is generally incurable. Despite high rates of complete response 
after initial immunochemotherapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation, 
patients have relapses. We investigated whether rituximab maintenance therapy at a 
dose of 375 mg per square meter of body-surface area administered every 2 months 
for 3 years after transplantation would prolong the duration of response.
METHODS
In a phase 3 trial involving 299 patients who were younger than 66 years of age at 
diagnosis, we randomly assigned 240 patients to receive rituximab maintenance 
therapy or to undergo observation after autologous stem-cell transplantation (120 pa-
tients per group); 59 patients did not undergo randomization. The primary end 
point was event-free survival (with an event defined as disease progression, relapse, 
death, allergy to rituximab, or severe infection) after transplantation among patients 
who underwent randomization.
RESULTS
After four courses of immunochemotherapy induction (rituximab, dexamethasone, 
cytarabine, and a platinum derivative [R-DHAP]), the overall response rate was 89%, 
and the complete response rate 77%. Transplantation was performed in 257 patients. 
The median follow-up from randomization after transplantation was 50.2 months 
(range, 46.4 to 54.2). Starting from randomization, the rate of event-free survival 
at 4 years was 79% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70 to 86) in the rituximab group 
versus 61% (95% CI, 51 to 70) in the observation group (P 
= 
0.001). The rate of progres-
sion-free survival at 4 years was 83% (95% CI, 73 to 88) in the rituximab group versus 
64% (95% CI, 55 to 73) in the observation group (P<0.001). The rate of overall sur-
vival was 89% (95% CI, 81 to 94) in the rituximab group versus 80% (95% CI, 72 to 
88) in the observation group (P 
= 
0.04). According to a Cox regression unadjusted 
analysis, the rate of overall survival at 4 years was higher in the rituximab group than 
in the observation group (hazard ratio for death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.99; P 
= 
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS
Rituximab maintenance therapy after transplantation prolonged event-free sur-
vival, progression-free survival, and overall survival among patients with mantle-
cell lymphoma who were younger than 66 years of age at diagnosis. (Funded by

Rituximab after Stem-Cell Transplantation in MCL
M
antle-cell lymphoma, which is 
characterized by a specific immuno-
phenotype and the chromosomal trans-
location t(11;14),1 accounts for approximately 6% 
of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas among adults. Af-
ter treatment, most patients have a relapse, and 
the duration of response decreases with each 
successive salvage therapy.2,3
One of the commonly recommended first-line 
treatments for patients who are eligible (accord-
ing to standard guidelines) to undergo trans-
plantation includes combined treatment with 
rituximab and high-dose cytarabine followed 
by autologous stem-cell transplantation.4,5 Re-
cently, a phase 3 prospective trial showed an 
advantage of alternating a chemotherapy regimen 
consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxo-
rubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) 
and a regimen consisting of rituximab, dexa-
methasone, high-dose cytarabine, and a plati-
num derivative (R-DHAP), as compared with the 
R-CHOP regimen alone, before transplantation.6 
Young patients with untreated mantle-cell lym-
phoma who received the R-CHOP and R-DHAP 
regimens had longer progression-free survival 
and a longer duration of remission than those 
who received the R-CHOP regimen alone, but 
they did not have longer overall survival.
The lack of a plateau on the survival curve in 
the results of the prospective trials that have 
been published to date6-8 suggests that residual 
tumor cells may persist after the end of treat-
ment and that these may drive relapses. Thus, we 
hypothesized that maintenance therapy may pro-
long the duration of complete response and re-
duce the risk of relapse.
Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting 
CD20, has shown a good safety profile and high 
efficiency in patients with various B-cell lym-
phomas. Prospective trials have investigated main-
tenance therapy with rituximab.9-11 The European 
Mantle Cell Lymphoma Network found that 
among elderly patients who had an initial re-
sponse to R-CHOP, rituximab maintenance ther-
apy until disease progression prolonged both 
progression-free survival and overall survival.12 
Rituximab maintenance therapy is currently not 
recommended after transplantation.
We conducted a randomized, prospective, 
phase 3 trial to investigate the role of rituximab 
maintenance therapy in patients with mantle-
cell lymphoma who had undergone autologous 
stem-cell transplantation. Because cytarabine 
plays a major role before transplantation in pa-
tients with mantle-cell lymphoma, four courses of 
R-DHAP were used as induction therapy. R-DHAP 
is an immunochemotherapy regimen without 
alkylating and anthracycline agents. To reduce 
the risk of long-term toxic effects, we used a 
transplantation conditioning regimen without 
total-body irradiation. The primary end point of 
the trial was event-free survival as evaluated 
from the date of randomization.
Methods
Characteristics of the Patients
The trial included patients 18 to 65 years of age 
who had untreated mantle-cell lymphoma and 
were eligible to undergo autologous stem-cell 
transplantation, who had disease of Ann Arbor 
stage II through IV (on a four-stage scale on 
which stage I indicates localized disease and 
increasing stage indicates more widespread dis-
ease), and who had an Eastern Cooperative On-
cology Group (ECOG) performance-status score 
of less than 3 (on a 5-point scale, with higher 
numbers indicating increasing disability). Patients 
who were positive for the human immunodefi-
ciency virus or those who presented with major 
coexisting conditions at diagnosis that were not 
related to lymphoma were excluded. The eligibil-
ity criteria are described in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this ar-
ticle at NEJM.org. The diagnosis of mantle-cell 
lymphoma was established by local expert pa-
thologists and reviewed centrally by pathology 
experts according to the 2008 World Health 
Organization classification. All the patients pro-
vided written informed consent.
Trial Protocol
Patients were included in the trial at the time of 
diagnosis. In brief, patients received induction 
chemotherapy with four courses of R-DHAP, re-
peated every 21 days. According to local practice 
(or in case of renal failure during treatment), 
investigators were allowed to use carboplatin or 
oxaliplatin instead of cisplatin. Stem cells were 
obtained according to local practice, after the 
third or fourth course of R-DHAP. The use of a 
chemotherapy regimen for stem-cell mobiliza-
tion was not authorized.
Tumor status was assessed according to the

1999 International Working Group criteria by 
local investigators (see the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). After four courses of R-DHAP, patients 
who were having a partial response and whose 
tumor mass had been reduced by less than 75%, 
as assessed by means of computed tomography 
(CT), received a rescue induction therapy with 
four courses of R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophos-
phamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and predniso-
lone), administered as one course every 14 days. 
Only patients who were having a response, includ-
ing those in complete remission (confirmed or 
unconfirmed) and those having a partial response 
(whose tumor mass was reduced by ≥75% after 
induction), were eligible to undergo transplanta-
tion. A minimal peripheral-blood progenitor-cell 
graft of 2×106 CD34+ cells per kilogram of body 
weight was required.
The conditioning regimen before transplanta-
tion was R-BEAM (rituximab, carmustine, etopo-
side, cytarabine, and melphalan). After trans-
plantation and up to 3 months later, patients 
were randomly assigned to receive rituximab 
maintenance therapy or to undergo observation. 
The schedule for maintenance therapy was the 
receipt of 375 mg of rituximab per square meter 
of body-surface area, administered intravenously 
every 2 months for 3 years. The total number of 
planned doses of rituximab was 23 (4 doses ad-
ministered with induction therapy, 1 dose with 
the preparative regimen for transplantation, and 
18 doses over the 3 years of maintenance ther-
apy). The trial protocol is available at NEJM.org.
Oversight
This unblinded, randomized prospective trial 
was performed according to the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was 
approved by an ethics committee. The trial be-
gan before it was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov 
owing to an administrative error. A total of 29 
patients were enrolled before registration. The 
first author and the last two authors designed 
the trial. Data were gathered by the investiga-
tors and by the sponsor and were analyzed by 
LYSARC (the academic research organization of 
the Lymphoma Study Association [LYSA]). All the 
authors had access to the data. The first author 
wrote the initial draft of the manuscript. All the 
authors contributed to the subsequent drafts, 
reviewed them, and jointly decided to submit the 
manuscript for publication. All the authors vouch 
for the integrity, accuracy, and completeness of 
the data and analyses and for the fidelity of the 
trial to the protocol. Roche supplied rituximab 
for the R-BEAM regimen and for maintenance 
therapy and funded the trial but did not contrib-
ute to the protocol design, trial execution, data 
collection or analysis, the writing of the manu-
script, or the decision to submit the manuscript 
for publication.
Staging, Monitoring, and End Points
At the time of inclusion, the disease characteris-
tics of the patients were assessed by means of 
clinical examination, standard biologic variables, 
bone marrow biopsy, and CT scan (neck, chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis). Response to therapy was 
assessed after the receipt of four courses of 
R-DHAP (and after R-CHOP in patients who re-
ceived salvage therapy) and after transplantation. 
Randomization was stratified, in a 1:1 ratio, 
according to the use or nonuse of R-CHOP be-
fore transplantation.
The primary end point was event-free survival 
after randomization. Events were defined as dis-
ease progression, relapse, death, severe infection 
(grade 4 with life-threatening severity), or allergy 
to rituximab that led to the discontinuation of 
treatment after randomization. Secondary end 
points were progression-free survival (i.e., free-
dom from disease progression, relapse, and death 
from any cause) and overall survival as assessed 
from inclusion and from randomization. The 
trial design and follow-up assessments are de-
scribed in detail in the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
Event-free survival was monitored and analyzed 
according to a group-sequential plan that includ-
ed one interim analysis in order to allow for 
early stopping on the basis of efficacy. The total 
sample of 299 patients provided the trial with 
80% power to detect a difference of 13 percent-
age points in the rate of event-free survival at 
4 years (expected rates of 83% in the rituximab 
group vs. 70% in the observation group) at an 
alpha level of 0.05. O’Brien–Fleming boundaries 
were used to check for type I error, with the 
overall alpha level being 0.05 for the number of 
patients who were included at the time of data 
cutoff. The interim analysis was performed when 
at least 82 patients had reached 3 years after 
transplantation. The significance level for the

interim analysis was set at 0.0051, and the sig-
nificance level for the final analysis was set at 
0.0475. At the interim analysis, with a median 
follow-up of 34 months after transplantation, the 
rate of event-free survival (P 
= 
0.006 by the log-
rank test) was under the O’Brien–Fleming bound-
ary. The present analysis is the final analysis.
The intention-to-treat population included all 
the patients who had undergone randomization, 
and the primary and secondary end points were 
evaluated with the inclusion of all patients who 
had protocol violations or withdrew. The included-
patients population constituted all the patients 
who provided written informed consent.
Time-to-event survival curves were estimated 
with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method. Time-
to-event end points in the different groups were 
compared with the use of log-rank tests and Cox 
proportional-hazards regression. Patients who 
withdrew (e.g., all the patients who did not un-
dergo randomization for any reason) and patients 
who were lost to follow-up (e.g., all the patients 
who underwent randomization and for whom an 
outcome was not updated for >1 year at the 
time of the final analysis) who did not have an 
event, as defined in the protocol at the time of 
the final analysis, had their data censored at the 
time of their last visit. Response rates were 
expressed in percentages with 95% exact confi-
dence intervals that were based on the Clopper–
Pearson method. All the statistical analyses were 
performed with the use of SAS software, version 
9.3 (SAS Institute).
Results
Treatment
From September 2008 through August 2012, we 
enrolled 299 patients in the study (Fig. 1). The 
characteristics of the patients at the time of in-
clusion are shown in Table 1. The central patho-
logical review confirmed the diagnosis in all 
patients (by means of immunochemical testing 
for immunophenotype, except in 5 patients in 
whom the diagnosis was made by means of 
fluorescence in situ hybridization of blood sam-
ples) except for 1, whose disease was classified 
as hairy-cell leukemia (this patient was retained 
in the included-patients population but did not 
undergo randomization).
One course of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, 
and prednisolone was administered to 35 patients 
(12%) before the initiation of R-DHAP induction 
therapy. Carboplatin was used from the first 
course of R-DHAP in 76 patients, and oxaliplatin 
was used in 38; the remainder received cisplatin. 
The overall response rate after induction therapy 
was 94%, including a complete response in 124 
patients (41%) and an unconfirmed complete re-
sponse in 107 (36%). The main reasons to stop 
treatment during induction therapy were disease 
progression (in 5 patients) and toxic effects (in 7) 
(Fig. 1). All the patients who had renal toxic ef-
fects had received cisplatin. R-CHOP was admin-
istered in 20 patients who had an insufficient 
response after R-DHAP, and 10 of these patients 
proceeded to transplantation (3 patients were 
having a complete remission, 6 were having an 
unconfirmed complete remission, and 1 was hav-
ing a partial response).
Overall, 257 of 299 patients (86%) underwent 
transplantation. After transplantation, 168 of 
257 patients (65%) had a complete remission, and 
61 (24%) had an unconfirmed complete remis-
sion. A total of 240 of 299 patients (80%) under-
went randomization and constituted the intention-
to-treat population; 120 patients were randomly 
assigned to the group that received rituximab 
maintenance therapy and 120 to the observation 
group. There was no significant difference be-
tween the two groups regarding the characteris-
tics at enrollment (inclusion) and the patients’ 
disease status at randomization (Table 1).
Outcome
At the stopping date (July 1, 2015), the median 
follow-up from inclusion was 54.4 months (range, 
52.7 to 59.2), and the median follow-up from 
randomization was 50.2 months (range, 46.4 to 
54.2). In the included-patients population, the 
median progression-free survival and median 
overall survival, as calculated from inclusion, 
were not reached. Among these patients, the 
4-year rate of progression-free survival was 68% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 62 to 73), and the 
4-year rate of overall survival was 78% (95% CI, 
73 to 82). According to the Mantle Cell Lym-
phoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI),14 
which is used to assess risk on the basis of age, 
ECOG performance-status score, lactate dehydro-
genase level, and white-cell count (see the Sup-
plementary Appendix), the median progression-
free survival and overall survival were not reached 
among low-risk and intermediate-risk patients;

Rituximab after Stem-Cell Transplantation in MCL
among high-risk patients, the median progres-
sion-free survival was 47.4 months and the me-
dian overall survival was 56.2 months (P<0.001 
for both comparisons with the low-risk group). 
(Results regarding progression-free survival and 
overall survival that were calculated from inclu-
sion and according to MIPI score are provided in 
Figs. S2 through S5 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix.)
According to the protocol definition, 25 pa-
tients (21%) had an event in the rituximab group, 
as compared with 47 (39%) in the observation 
group. A total of 83 patients in the rituximab 
group completed the scheduled 3-year course of 
therapy. The main reasons to stop maintenance 
therapy were disease progression (in 16 patients) 
and neutropenia (in 9). Serious infection after 
transplantation was observed in 4 patients in 
each group (spondylitis, pyelonephritis, septice-
mia, and varicella pneumonia in 1 patient each 
in the rituximab group and septicemia, cellulitis, 
meningitis, and severe pneumonia in both lungs 
in 1 patient each in the observation group).
Information regarding grade 3 and 4 toxic 
effects, according to randomization and trial 
period, is provided in Table S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. In brief, the most frequent 
toxic event of grade 3 or 4 was neutropenia. A 
second cancer caused death in 3 patients in the 
rituximab group and in 1 in the observation 
group. No late effect of rituximab has been re-
ported so far in either trial group. After random-
ization, 16 patients had disease progression and 
13 patients died in the rituximab group, as com-
pared with 37 patients who had disease progres-
sion and 24 who died in the observation group. 
The major cause of death in each group was 
lymphoma (in 8 patients in the rituximab group 
and 16 in the observation group).
The median event-free survival from random-
ization was not reached in either group (Fig. 2A). 
The 4-year rate of event-free survival as calculated 
from randomization was 79% (95% CI, 70 to 86) 
in the rituximab group, as compared with 61% 
(95% CI, 51 to 70) in the observation group 
(P 
= 
0.001), with a hazard ratio for disease pro-
gression, relapse, death, rituximab allergy, or 
severe infection of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.28 to 0.74; 
P 
= 
0.002).
The median progression-free survival and over-
all survival from randomization were not reached 
in either group. The 4-year rates of progression-
free survival and overall survival were signifi-
cantly higher in the rituximab group than in the 
observation group. The rate of progression-free 
survival was 83% (95% CI, 73 to 88) in the ritux-
imab group, as compared with 64% (95% CI, 55 
to 73) in the observation group (hazard ratio for 
disease progression, relapse, or death, 0.40; 95% 
CI, 0.23 to 0.68; P<0.001) (Fig. 2B). The rate of 
overall survival was 89% (95% CI, 81 to 94) in 
the rituximab group, as compared with 80% 
(95% CI, 72 to 88) in the observation group 
(hazard ratio for death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26 to 
0.99; P 
= 
0.04) (Fig. 2C). The per-protocol analy-
sis yielded similar results (see the Supplementary 
Appendix).
A total of 11 patients received R-CHOP before 
randomization; of these patients, 4 were assigned 
to the rituximab group (1 patient had disease 
progression and died and 3 did not have a re-
lapse and were alive at the time of the final 
analysis) and 7 to the observation group (4 pa-
tients had a relapse and were alive at the time of 
the final analysis and 3 died). Among the 59 
patients who did not undergo randomization, the 
median progression-free survival was 11.0 months 
(95% CI, 6.4 to 28.0), and the median overall 
survival was 30.6 months (95% CI, 12.3 to 44.6).
Discussion
Rituximab maintenance therapy that was ad-
ministered every other month for 3 years after 
transplantation prolonged event-free survival, 
progression-free survival, and overall survival 
Figure 1 (facing page). Eligibility Assessment, Treatment, 
Randomization, and Follow-up of the Patients.
The R-DHAP regimen consisted of rituximab, dexameth-
asone, high-dose cytarabine, and a platinum derivative. 
A total of 20 patients who received all four courses of 
the R-DHAP regimen then received the R-CHOP regi-
men, which consisted of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone. After autol-
ogous stem-cell transplantation, 120 patients were as-
signed to receive rituximab maintenance therapy and 
120 were assigned to the observation group.

There was no significant difference between the two randomized groups regarding the characteristics at the time of inclusion and disease status before randomization. The intention-
to-treat population included all the patients who had undergone randomization, and the included-patients population constituted all the patients who had provided written informed 
consent. R-CHOP denotes rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone; R-DHAP rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and a platinum deriva-
tive; and ULN upper limit of the normal range.
†  
The reasons that 59 patients included in the trial did not undergo randomization were disease progression (13 patients), death from toxic effects during induction therapy or autologous 
stem-cell transplantation (11), renal toxic effects (8), toxic effects in other organs (3), allergy to rituximab or inability to take rituximab (4), withdrawal of consent or decision by the 
 
patient to not undergo randomization (4), ineligibility for autologous stem-cell transplantation (4), failure to obtain stem cells (2), infection (2), prolonged neutropenia after autolo-
gous stem-cell transplantation (2), hemorrhage (2), other cancer (2), protocol violation (1), and unknown reason (1).
‡  
B symptoms are systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and fever.
§ 
 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status scores are assessed on a 5-point scale, with higher numbers indicating increasing disability. A score of less than  
3 indicates that the patient is at least ambulatory and capable of all self-care, although he or she may be unable to carry out any work activities, and that the patient is out of bed  
more than 50% of waking hours.
¶  
The Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI) is used in patients with mantle-cell lymphoma to assess risk on the basis of age, ECOG performance-status score, 
lactate dehydrogenase level, and white-cell count (see the Supplementary Appendix).

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
among patients with mantle-cell lymphoma who 
were younger than 66 years of age. These results 
show the efficacy of a cytarabine-based induc-
tion regimen free of anthracycline or alkylating 
agents in patients with this condition.
Among patients with chemotherapy-sensitive 
disease who had a response to induction therapy 
and transplantation and received rituximab main-
tenance therapy, the 4-year rate of progression-
free survival was 83%, and the 4-year rate of 
overall survival was 89%. Maintenance therapy 
with rituximab after R-DHAP induction therapy, 
followed by R-BEAM consolidation therapy, pre-
vented relapses and was associated with a low 
risk of major infection. Whether maintenance 
therapy with rituximab improves outcomes in 
patients who are treated with other regimens is 
unknown.
The prolongation in overall survival that was 
observed in this trial suggests that the delivery 
of maintenance therapy beyond 3 years might be 
questionable. We did not measure changes in 
immunoglobulin levels and are unable to assess 
the degree and duration of immune suppression 
that are associated with this approach to treat-
ment. We did not detect a higher rate of infec-
tious complications in the rituximab group than 
in the observation group. Because status regard-
ing minimal residual disease can predict outcome 
in patients, it could be postulated that patients 
with negative minimal residual disease status 
(i.e., those with a level of disease below the 
threshold of detection) after transplantation may 
not benefit from maintenance therapy. However,

Figure 2. Event-free Survival, Progression-free Survival, 
and Overall Survival.
The Kaplan–Meier analyses of event-free survival, pro-
gression-free survival, and overall survival were per-
formed according to trial group. Survival was calculated 
from the time of randomization. Event-free survival was 
defined as freedom from disease progression, relapse, 
death, allergy to rituximab, and severe infection. The 
hazard ratio for progression, relapse, death, rituximab 
allergy, or infection was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.28 to 0.74; 
P = 0.002) (Panel A). Tick marks indicate censored data, 
and the shaded areas 95% confidence intervals. Progres-
sion-free survival was defined as freedom from disease 
progression, relapse, and death from any cause. The 
hazard ratio for progression, relapse, or death was 0.40 
(95% CI, 0.23 to 0.68; P<0.001) (Panel B). In the analy-
sis of overall survival, the hazard ratio for death was 
0.50 (95% CI, 0.26 to 0.99; P = 0.04) (Panel C).

Rituximab after Stem-Cell Transplantation in MCL
this question has not been addressed. In addi-
tion to monitoring for minimal residual disease, 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron-emission tomog-
raphy (FDG-PET) could also be a useful tool to 
drive medical decision making regarding the use 
of maintenance therapy after transplantation. 
Monitoring for minimal residual disease and 
FDG-PET were performed in the present trial but 
were not used for decision making.
The use of high-dose cytarabine plus ritux-
imab is recommended in young patients with 
mantle-cell lymphoma. The most common regi-
mens — that is, alternating R-CHOP or R-DHAP, 
the alternative maxi-CHOP regimen with high-
dose cytarabine (Nordic MCL2 protocol), and 
R-hyper-CVAD (rituximab, hyperfractionated cy-
clophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and 
dexamethasone)6,7,15 — combine rituximab and 
cytarabine, alkylating agents, and an anthracy-
cline. We reasoned, on the basis of results from 
previous clinical trials, that cytarabine and plati-
num derivatives alone might be sufficient to in-
duce a response rate similar to that seen in com-
bined protocols that have used regimens with 
anthracyclines or alkylating agents. The rates of 
response and complete response after the ad-
ministration of R-DHAP in the trial population 
seem to be similar to those that have been ob-
served with regimens including anthracycline or 
alkylating agents. R-DHAP induction therapy has 
several advantages, including its easy use in daily 
practice, short duration, and low doses of cyta-
rabine. In addition, it has no late cardiac toxic 
effects. Among the 184 patients who received 
cisplatin in the first course of chemotherapy, 27 
switched to carboplatin and 38 switched to ox-
aliplatin. In contrast, only 1 patient who was 
treated with carboplatin switched to cisplatin, 
and 1 who was treated with oxaliplatin switched 
to carboplatin. In view of the toxicity of cispla-
tin, a prospective trial addressing the choice of 
platinum compound in chemotherapy for lym-
phoma is warranted.
The most commonly used conditioning regi-
mens are BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytara-
bine, and melphalan), BEAC (carmustine, etopo-
side, cytarabine, and cyclophosphamide), and a 
total-body irradiation–based regimen.6,7 The role 
of total-body irradiation is still a matter of de-
bate because it is not available in all centers and 
is associated with considerable short-term and 
long-term toxic effects. Our results with regard 
to progression-free survival and overall survival 
are in line with those of the Nordic Lymphoma 
Group and suggest that total-body irradiation–
based conditioning regimens may not be superior 
to chemotherapy alone when an effective regimen 
is used during induction.8,15,16
In conclusion, our trial showed that an induc-
tion regimen with four courses of R-DHAP fol-
lowed by transplantation without total-body 
irradiation resulted in a high rate of complete 
response. A 3-year course of rituximab mainte-
nance therapy administered every 2 months pro-
longed overall survival among young patients 
with mantle-cell lymphoma.
