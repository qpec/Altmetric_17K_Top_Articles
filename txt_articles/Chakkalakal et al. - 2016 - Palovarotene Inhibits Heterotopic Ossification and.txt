Abstract
Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare and as yet untreatable, genetic disorder of 
progressive extraskeletal ossification, is the most disabling form of heterotopic ossification (HO) 
in humans and causes skeletal deformities, movement impairment and premature death. Most FOP 
patients carry an activating mutation in a BMP type I receptor gene, ACVR1R206H, that promotes 
ectopic chondrogenesis and osteogenesis and in turn HO. We showed previously that the retinoic 
acid receptor γ (RARγ) agonist Palovarotene effectively inhibited HO in injury-induced and 
genetic mouse models of the disease. Here we report that the drug additionally prevents 
spontaneous HO, using a novel conditional-on knock-in mouse line carrying the human 
ACVR1R206H mutation for classic FOP. In addition, Palovarotene restored long bone growth, 
maintained growth plate function, and protected growing mutant neonates when given to lactating 
mothers. Importantly, Palovarotene maintained joint, limb and body motion, providing clear 
evidence for its encompassing therapeutic potential as a treatment for FOP.

Introduction
Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP; MIM 135100) is an extremely disabling genetic 
disorder in which excess bone tissue forms episodically and postnatally at multiple ectopic 
sites around the skeletal bones and joints and within soft connective tissues such as tendons, 
ligaments, and skeletal muscles, leading to progressive joint ankylosis, skeletal deformities, 
growth impairment, breathing difficulty, and premature death(1). Analyses of surgical 
retrieval specimens showed that the extra-skeletal bone tissue that forms in FOP patients – a 
process described as heterotopic ossification (HO) – is invariably endochondral in nature(2). 
As such, its formation involves recruitment and proliferation of progenitor mesenchymal 
cells, their differentiation into chondrocytes, maturation and hypertrophy of cartilage, and 
transition to endochondral bone and mature heterotopic ossification. An anatomical site 
where HO initiates is recognized by FOP patients as a local ‘flare-up’ and is characterized 
by swelling, pain, erythema, and stiffness preceding overt bone formation(3). Such 
symptoms indicate local inflammation, and early stage lesions are often characterized by the 
presence and accumulation of innate immune cells, including mast cells that are thought to 
have an important role in inducing and initiating the HO formation process(4). As a 
consequence, the current standard of care for FOP patients includes systemic treatment with 
corticosteroids within 24 hours of the onset of a flare-up, with treatment continued for 
several days to reduce inflammation and pain(5). However, corticosteroids, or any other 
current drug treatments, are unable to reliably prevent HO(6).
Patients with a classic clinical presentation of FOP carry a specific germline heterozygous 
gain-of-function mutation – R206H – in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I 
receptor ACVR1 (also known as ALK2)(7). BMP signaling plays a major role in 
skeletogenesis and promotes chondrogenesis(8, 9). ACVR1/ALK2 acts as a BMP receptor 
and a constitutively active Alk2 mouse mutant induces ectopic endochondral 
ossification(10, 11). Importantly, the activating ACVR1R206H mutation promotes excess 
chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells recruited to the flare-up site, 
eliciting a skeletogenic response that leads to formation of heterotopic bone through an 
endochondral process(3, 12).
Previous findings showed that endogenous retinoid signaling is normally attenuated during 
chondrogenesis, that this attenuation is required for chondrogenic differentiation(13, 14), and 
that exogenous retinoid agonists can block chondrogenesis effectively and rapidly(15). We 
therefore targeted the RA signaling pathway to inhibit the obligate chondrogenic phase of 
HO in FOP and in turn reduce or prevent HO(16, 17). Synthetic retinoid agonists, each 
selective for different nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARα or RARγ)(18, 19) were tested in 
mouse models of subcutaneous and intramuscular injury-induced HO as well as mice 
bearing an inducible and constitutive active Acvr1Q207D transgene(20), the only model of

 genetically-driven HO available at the time, but one that is not fully representative of the 
human FOP genotype(21). We found that agonists for RARα and RARγ were indeed 
successful in inhibiting chondrogenesis and preventing HO, but the RARγ agonists were far 
more effective(16, 17). This is likely due to the fact that RARγ is highly and selectively 
expressed in chondrogenic cells and chondrocytes compared to the other RAR 
members (22, 23). One of the RARγ class drugs was Palovarotene, a highly-specific RARγ 
agonist that was previously tested in a two-year Phase 2 clinical trial for another 
condition(24).
Although the previous studies were quite promising, many questions remained unanswered 
and most importantly whether Palovarotene would be as effective in preventing HO 
triggered by the human ACVR1R206H mutation as it did for Acvr1Q207D and whether this 
treatment could ameliorate overall skeletal function and restore skeletal growth. The 
Acvr1Q207D mutation is a constitutively activating Acvr1 mutation that induces robust 
downstream BMP pathway activation in the absence of ligand; this mutation does not occur 
in FOP patients. In contrast, the Acvr1R206H mutation is the most common mutation in FOP, 
occurring in >97% of FOP patients; it is a mildly-activating mutation in the absence of 
exogenous ligand, but is also very highly ligand responsive. The data in the present study, 
using a novel conditional-on knock-in ACVR1[R206H]FlEx mouse model that faithfully 
phenocopies classic FOP, provide strong and clear support for Palovarotene as an effective 
treatment to prevent FOP heterotopic ossification and protect skeletal function.
Materials and Methods
Mice
A conditional-on knock-in mouse model Acvr1[R206H]FlEx was developed to encode the 
common R206H mutant allele in FOP following recombination by Cre(25). For doxycycline-
inducible global allele expression, Acvr1[R206H]FlEx/+ mice were mated with mice double 
transgenic for R26-rtTA and tetO-Cre (heterozygous Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(rtTA*M2)Jae and 
hemizygous Tg(tetO-Cre)1Jaw; Jackson Laboratories) to generate 
Acvr1[R206H]FlEx/+;Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(rtTA*M2)Jae; Tg(tetO-Cre)1Jaw mice (which we refer 
to as Acvr1cR206H/+). For expression in Prrx1+ progenitor cells, Acvr1[R206H]FlEx/+ mice 
were mated with heterozygous B6.Cg-Tg(Prrx1-Cre)1Cjt (Jackson Laboratories) to generate 
Acvr1[R206H]FlEx/+;Prrx1-Cre+/− mice (Prrx1-R206H). Acvr1+/+ and 
Acvr1[R206H]FlEx/+(without Cre) littermates were used as controls. To confirm the 
distribution of Prrx1-expressing cells in mouse limbs, Prrx1-Cre mice were crossed with 
Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato-EGFP)Luo reporter mice (mT/mG; Jackson Laboratories). 
To detect PTHrP expression in growth plates, Prrx1-R206H and control mice in a 
heterozygous PTHrP-lacZ reporter background(26) (a gift from Arthur Broadus, Yale) were 
used. All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee at University of Pennsylvania.

 Injury-induced heterotopic ossification in Acvr1R206H/+;R26-rtTA;tetO-Cre mice and 
treatment with Palovarotene
One-month-old Acvr1cR206H/+ mice were provided doxycycline chow (Harlan Laboratories, 
Madison, WI) for 3 days to induce mutant gene expression globally. Mouse quadriceps 
muscles were injured by injection with 50 μl of 10 μM cardiotoxin (Sigma). Beginning on 
the day of injury, Palovarotene or vehicle (1:4 DMSO in corn oil) was administered daily for 
14 days by oral gavage (100μg/mouse from day 1–3 and 15μg/mouse from day 4–14) using a 
20-gauge gavage needle (Fine Science Tools). Palovarotene (R667, Atomax Chemicals, 
China) solution in DMSO was stored at −20°C under argon and diluted (1:4) with corn oil 
for administration.
Induction of HO in Prrx1-R206H mice and treatment with Palovarotene
Heterotopic ossification in Prrx1-R206H mice occurs spontaneously in the absence of injury. 
Palovarotene treatment of Prrx1-R206H and control mice was administered orally to 
lactating mice (50μg/mouse/day) beginning on day of delivery and continuing for 15 days. 
Treatment to pups was continued by oral gavage (20μg/pup) on alternate days from P16 to 
P30.
Imaging analyses
Heterotopic ossification was detected and quantified by micro-computed tomography (μCT) 
of paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed whole mouse specimens (eXplore Locus SP μCT 
Specimen Scanner; GE Healthcare). Volumetric data were acquired using the following 
parameters: 80 kVp and 80 μA X-ray tube voltage and current, 250 μm aluminum filter, 1.7 s 
integration time, 400 views at 0.5° increments, 2×2 detector bin mode, 4 averages, 1 hr scan 
time. Image data were reconstructed at a resolution of 40.5 μm isotropic voxels using a 
Feldkamp cone beam algorithm. Reconstructed 3D data were analyzed and volumes 
rendered using OsiriX software (www.osirix-viewer.com). High-resolution, cross-sectional 
images of hindlimbs were obtained using a VivaCT 40 μCT (Scanco Medical AG, 
Brüttisellen, Switzerland) at a source voltage of 55kV, a source current of 145 μA, and an 
isotropic voxel size of 10.5 μm. Reconstructed 3-D images and Scanco μCT software were 
used for measuring lengths of femurs and tibia.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Fixed tissues (4% PFA) were decalcified using Immunocal™ (Decal Chemical Corporation, 
Tallman, NY) for 3 days, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned serially at 7 μm. 
Deparaffinized sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin (Sigma) or Alcian blue/
hematoxylin/Orange G for cartilage and bone. Mast cells were detected by modified CEM 
staining (American MasterTech, KTCEM).
For immunohistochemical staining, deparaffinized sections were treated for antigen retrieval 
with 10 mM Na citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or 1% hyaluronidase at 37°C for 60 min. Endogenous 
peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Sections were 
blocked (Background Buster; American MasterTech), and incubated with primary antibody 
overnight at 4°C, followed by appropriate HRP linked secondary antibody and DAB 
detection (SuperPicTure™ Polymer, Invitrogen). Primary antibodies used were for: Collagen

 II (Abcam, ab21291), Sox9(Abcam, ab26414), PTHrP (Abcam, ab93121), phosphorylated-
Smad1/5/8 (Cell Signaling, 9511S),. Hematoxylin (Vector Labs) was the counterstain. For β-
galactosidase detection, fixed tissues were processed with a LacZ staining kit (Invivogen, 
rep-lz-t), decalcified in EDTA (pH6.5), transferred to 30% sucrose (Fisher Scientific) and 
embedded in OTC (American MasterTech) before serial sectioning at 14 μm.
To detect proliferating cells in vivo, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5-bromo-2′-
deoxyuridine (BrdU) solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 10 μl/g mouse(27). Tissues were 
harvested after 3 or 36 hr, fixed in 4% PFA, processed as above, and detected by BrdU 
immunohistochemical staining (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Microscopy imaging and quantification
Histological images were captured using Eclipse 90i microscope (Nikon) and processed 
using NIS-Elements microscope imaging software (Nikon). Measurements of the lengths of 
growth plate zones were performed using the NIS-Elements microscope imaging software 
and data obtained was analyzed statistically. Stained sections were analyzed by independent 
investigators without bias and with random blinding methods.
Whole mount skeletal staining
For skeletal staining, skin and internal organs were removed from neonates and adult mice 
and skeletons were processed for differential staining using Alcian blue and Alizarin red as 
described(28). Cleared and stained skeleton images were captured and lengths of long bones 
were measured using a Leica DFC 450c instrument and software.
Statistical analysis
Data obtained were analyzed statistically using Graph Pad Prism software (t-test and two-
way Anova); values are expressed as the mean ± SEM in bar graphs. All data are from a 
minimum of three independent experiments.
Results
Palovarotene inhibits heterotopic ossification (HO) in a mouse model of FOP
To create a mouse model of FOP, we used a knock-in mouse line in which exon 5 containing 
the human R206H mutation replaces a wild-type exon 5 within the Acvr1 locus upon Cre 
recombinase activity (Supplemental Fig. 1; see Methods). In a first set of studies, 1-month-
old heterozygous Acvr1[R206H]FlEx/+;Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(rtTA*M2)Jae;Tg(tetO-Cre)1Jaw 
mice (briefly referred to as Acvr1cR206H/+) were treated with doxycycline to globally induce 
Cre recombinase and concomitant recombination of the Acvr1[R206H]FlEx/+ allele leading to 
expression of Acvr1R206H in the tissues where Acvr1 is normally expressed. Subsequently, 
the mice were injected with cardiotoxin into the quadriceps muscle of one leg to provoke 
local inflammation, muscle damage and HO(17). Starting from day 1 of injury, half of the 
Acvr1cR206H/+ mice were treated with Palovarotene by daily gavage for 14 days and the 
other half received vehicle as control. Analysis by μCT and 3D image reconstruction at day 
14 showed that large HO tissue masses had formed in the targeted leg of Acvr1cR206H/+ 
mutant mice receiving vehicle (Fig. 1A, arrow, left panel), but HO formation was greatly

 diminished in Palovarotene-treated companions (Fig. 1A, arrow, right panel) by over 80% 
based on bone volume/total volume quantification (Fig. 1B). Histochemical analysis 
confirmed that newly formed cartilaginous tissue and endochondral bone were present in 
untreated mutants (Fig. 1C, circled area), but not in treated Acvr1cR206H/+ mutant mice (Fig. 
1C, right panel). This analysis revealed also that untreated mutants showed a strong local 
fibroproliferative response and numerous mast cells within the muscle tissues at and around 
the site of incipient HO formation (Fig. 1D, F; left panels), but both responses were greatly 
reduced in Palovarotene-treated animals (Fig. 1D, F; right panels and Supplemental Fig. 2) 
by 60 to 80% (Fig. 1E, G).
A severe functional consequence of HO is that it can impair or completely block skeletal 
movement and joint function(29). Indeed, video of live, untreated ACVR1cR206H/+ mutant 
mice at ~14 days after HO induction by injury showed that movement of HO-affected legs 
was overtly impaired, but in Palovarotene-treated mice the cardiotoxin-injured legs appeared 
to move and function well and similarly to the contralateral uninjured leg (Supplemental 
Video 1).
Prenatal expression of Acvr1R206H causes limb skeletal malformations and HO
FOP patients are characterized by a great toe (first digit) malformation that is present at birth 
and reflects aberrant embryonic skeletal development(29). Thus, we investigated whether 
prenatal expression of Acvr1R206H would affect skeletal development, growth and 
morphogenesis. Since unrestricted endogenous activation of Acvr1R206H during early 
embryonic development leads to perinatal lethality(30), we limited expression to a population 
of skeletal progenitor cells (Prrx1+) in order to investigate effects on local skeletal 
development. Acvr1[R206H]FlEx/+ mice were mated with Prrx1-Cre mice to generate mutant 
embryos expressing Acvr1R206H throughout the lateral plate mesoderm-derived limb 
mesenchyme(31). Acvr1[R206H]FlEx/+: Prrx1-Cre mice (which will be referred to as Prrx1-
R206H) were born at a normal Mendelian frequency and were not grossly different from 
companion control littermates (Acvr1+/+ and Acvr1[R206H]FlEx/+ without Cre) (Fig. 2A). 
However, when mice were examined after birth, the first digits of the hindlimbs were 
observed to be malformed as clearly revealed by radiographic imaging (Fig. 2C, arrows, 
right panel). While no obvious HO was present within the limbs themselves at these early 
ages (Fig. 2B), spontaneous HO became extensive by 1 month of age in mutants (Fig. 2D, E, 
arrows, right panels) and, and was detected first in the hindlimbs at ~P7 and then in the 
forelimbs beginning at ~P14. HO in both hind and forelimbs progressively increased over 
time (Supplemental Fig. 3) but was absent in control littermates. These phenotypes were 
fully penetrant, and the sites of HO formation were consistent with the locations of Prrx1+ 
lineage cells. The appearance of HO in this Prrx1-R206H mouse model was also consistent 
with the appearance of HO in patients with FOP. Patients do, however, develop HO in other 
areas of their body, including the back and neck, indicating that HO in FOP can involve cell 
types belonging to lineages other than those descending from Prrx1-expressing cells.
Long bone elongation was significantly impaired in Prrx1-R206H mice (Fig. 3A). Lengths 
of humerus, radius, femur and tibia were reduced in 5 day-old mutants (Fig. 3B), and growth 
retardation persisted at 1 month (Supplemental Fig. 4). Of note, lengths of bones did not

 appear to be proportionally reduced. Clinical observations have suggested that 
disproportionate limb lengths may occur in some FOP patients, however this remains to be 
verified in detailed studies. Histological analysis showed that the epiphyseal area was not 
grossly altered in the mutants, retaining a largely normal shape and size, however there was 
a significant reduction in the height of the growth plate hypertrophic zone (Fig. 3C, right 
panel; and Fig. 3D), a region of the growth plate primarily responsible for long bone 
elongation(32, 33).
To further characterize the phenotype of the growth plate, longitudinal sections of tibias 
from day 14 mutant and control mice were processed for cartilage marker analysis by 
immunohistochemistry. Overall growth plate homeostasis and functioning were found to be 
defective in mutants as indicated by: (i) increased levels of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 and 
Sox9 in mutant hypertrophic zone (Fig. 4A, B, right panels), both of which are normally 
expressed at barely detectable levels in that area of the elongating growth plate(34, 35) (Fig. 
4A, B, left panels); and (ii) higher levels of collagen II and PTHrP throughout the mutant 
growth plates (Fig. 4C, D, right panels) compared to the more restricted patterns in controls 
(Fig. 4C, D, left panels). To verify cells transcribing PTHrP, we used PTHrP-lacZ mice(26) 
to create reporter;Prrx1-R206H mice. We found that PTHrP expression was expanded in 
mutants (Fig. 4E, right panel), correlating well with the expanded distribution of PTHrP 
protein (Fig. 4D), while reporter activity was present more narrowly in control growth plates 
(Fig. 4E, left panel). Together, dysregulated PTHrP expression and high levels of 
phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 and Sox9 may have overwhelmed the growth plate, disturbing 
hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes and delaying the cartilage to bone transition in 
the growth-plates of Acvr1R206H/+ mutant mice.
In addition to hypertrophic zone elongation, physiologic activity of the growth plate is also 
influenced by chondrocyte proliferation, a process that is restricted to the distal end of the 
growth plate where commitment of proliferating chondrocytes to mature and differentiate 
occurs. To determine whether this process was altered in mutants, 2-week-old Prrx1-R206H 
mice and control littermates were injected with the cell proliferation marker BrdU, sacrificed 
at 3 or 36 hours after injection, and processed for immunohistochemical detection of BrdU-
labeled chondrocytes in long bone growth plates. At the 3-hour time point, both control and 
mutant long bones displayed labeled chondrocytes in the upper portion of their growth plates 
that includes the proliferative and prehypertrophic zones (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, mutant 
growth plates contained a consistently higher number of labeled chondrocytes (Fig. 5B, 
upper zone), indicating higher cell proliferation rates compared to controls. At 36 hours, 
substantial numbers of BrdU+ cells in control growth plates have transitioned to the 
hypertrophic zone (Fig. 5C, left panel); however, mutant growth plates retained a 
considerable number of labeled cells in the upper zone and only a few in the hypertrophic 
zone (Fig. 5C, right panel; and Fig. 5D), indicating that mutant cells did not advance through 
the growth plate zones at normal rates.

 Palovarotene reduces spontaneous HO and improves skeletal malformations and growth 
in Acvr1R206H/+ mutants
To determine whether Palovarotene could prevent or alleviate the severe neonatal and 
postnatal skeletal defects in Prrx1-R206H mice, treatment was initiated from a neonatal 
stage. Palovarotene was administered to nursing transgenic females (that had been mated to 
Prrx1-Cre males) by daily gavage with the expectation that the drug would be passed to the 
pups through breastfeeding. Companion nursing females received vehicle. Litters included 
both mutants and control littermates, and drug or vehicle administration to the nursing 
mothers was continued until day 14. Thereafter, the drug (or vehicle) was administered 
directly to the young mice by oral gavage on alternate days until 1 month of age. Whole 
body skeletal examination by μCT showed that compared to controls (Fig. 6A, first panel), 
extensive HO had developed in the limbs of mutants, in particular their hindlimbs (Fig. 6A, 
third panel, arrows). Treatment of control mice with Palovarotene caused reduction in 
skeletal growth (Fig. 6A, second panel; and Fig. 6B), as previously observed in response to 
other retinoid agonists(36, 37), but no other major obvious phenotype was noted. 
Palovarotene-treated mutants showed markedly reduced HO that was nearly absent in their 
forelimbs and much reduced in hindlimbs (Fig. 6A, fourth panel). Of particular note, long 
bone length was considerably protected in Palovarotene-treated mutants (Fig. 6B) in contrast 
to the negative effects of Palovarotene on control long bone growth (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, 
while vehicle-treated mutants had severe movement impediment and difficulties, drug-
treated mutants were mobile and appeared to function well (Supplemental Video 2). This 
was consistent with the beneficial effects of Palovarotene on mobility of injury-induced 
older mutants shown above (Supplemental Video 1). When Palovarotene treatment was 
delayed until day 14 and given only to the young mice, it was not as effective at inhibiting 
HO and maintaining mobility (not shown), suggesting importance of early treatment.
Control mice receiving Palovarotene from birth were not only stunted (Fig. 6A) but 
exhibited also a significant reduction in safranin-O positive cartilage matrix in their growth 
plates (Fig. 6C, second panel) compared to untreated controls (Fig. 6C, first panel), likely 
the result of decreased matrix production or enhanced catabolism(38, 39). In sharp contrast, 
Palovarotene treatment not only protected long bone growth of the mutant mice (Fig. 6B), 
but also preserved the organization of their growth plates and matrix deposition (Fig. 6C, 
third panel; and Fig. 6D). These data suggest that interactions between Palovarotene and 
Acvr1R206H compensated for the negative effects of each on skeletal growth and phenotype, 
and that the effects of, and responses to, drug treatment differ in control and mutant cells and 
tissues.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that the highly specific RARγ agonist Palovarotene is a potent 
inhibitor of both trauma-induced and spontaneous HO elicited by the human ACVR1R206H 
FOP mutation in a novel mouse model of classic FOP. We further show that Palovarotene 
can inhibit HO that was triggered by post-natal tissue trauma or provoked systemically from 
an early age in the absence of overt trauma. Our data additionally demonstrate that 
Palovarotene can counteract the broader ravages of HO, including deleterious, often

 debilitating, effects on skeletal growth and mobility. Previous studies conducted through a 
phase 2 clinical trial for emphysema showed that Palovarotene is well tolerated by patients 
with relatively few and minor side effects(24). Those studies and the data here provide further 
support for Palovarotene as a safe and effective drug for the treatment and prevention of HO 
in FOP patients and potentially also for non-FOP patients who can form endochondral HO 
following severe injury or invasive surgeries(40, 41).
Acvr1R206H knock-in mice mimic the defects seen in FOP patients(29, 30), including skeletal 
growth retardation which is likely a result of (i) the extensive HO within muscles and 
connective tissues surrounding the skeletal elements that indirectly hampers skeletal growth 
and (ii) direct effects of the Acvr1R206H mutation and enhanced BMP signaling on growth 
plate physiology. Normally, BMP signaling - mainly via Bmpr1a and 1b - is active in the 
proliferative and prehypertrophic zones where it promotes and sustains Sox9 expression and 
chondrocyte proliferation, and is markedly reduced in the hypertrophic zone in order to 
facilitate transition to bone(34, 42). Previous in vitro data indicate that the ACVR1 receptor 
plays a key role in early steps of chondrocyte differentiation and commitment(12). Acvr1 was 
recently shown to be expressed in growth plates, and its conditional ablation in cartilage was 
found to cause growth plate dysfunction and reduced chondrocyte proliferation(43). 
Consistently, we observe greater proliferation in the Acvr1R206H growth plates, with failure 
or significant delay in hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation. As a result, the overall 
effects of enhanced activation of Acvr1R206H led to compromised bone growth, supporting 
the notion that the appropriate magnitude and distribution of BMP receptor signaling are 
critical for normal longitudinal bone growth(9). Because Palovarotene inhibits BMP 
signaling(16, 17), it may restore skeletal growth in mutant mice by reducing BMP signaling to 
re-establish more physiologic signaling levels. Importantly, patients with FOP have multiple, 
variable and often severe skeletal anomalies affecting long bone growth predominantly in 
the lower limbs, and the skeletal effects noted in the mouse model emphasize the necessity 
for a more robust clinical characterization of this often overlooked feature in patients(44, 45). 
Such studies are ongoing.
In this study, we observed that Palovarotene counteracted multiple soft tissue and skeletal 
pathologies in Acvr1R206H/+ mutant mice. In their damaged muscle tissue, Palovarotene 
treatment was associated with fewer mast cells and reductions in fibroproliferation, cartilage 
formation, and the amount of HO. Within the skeletons of mutant mice, Palovarotene 
treatment led to restoration of proliferative and hypertrophic zones of growth plates and 
improvement of compromised bone growth. The articular malformations in the great toe, the 
heterotopic endochondral ossification and the severe skeletal dysplasia observed in our 
knock-in mouse model of classic FOP confirm the widespread effects of the Acvr1R206H 
mutation on a broad population of cartilage cells and precursor cells in the skeleton and soft 
connective tissues. Furthermore, in conjunction with our previous studies showing a role of 
retinoid signaling in hypertrophic cartilage to bone transition(22, 39), the abrogation of 
heterotopic ossification and reversal of skeletal defects by Palovarotene provide robust in 
vivo support for the idea that a fine balance between BMP and retinoid signaling, and in 
particular between Acvr1 and RARγ, is normally critical for growth plate function and 
skeletal growth, as occurs in other biological processes(46). For example, one role for 
endogenous retinoid signaling in hypertrophic cartilage would be to reduce BMP signaling

 and facilitate transition to bone. Thus, interactions between retinoid and BMP signaling are 
likely to be context dependent and/or receptor isoform specific, and to be greatly modulated 
by altered activity of mutant BMP receptors. Further characterization of Acvr1 and RARγ 
interactions will be useful not only for understanding the action and mechanisms of such key 
regulators, but also for identifying additional druggable targets and even more effective 
treatment regimens.
HO is highly damaging to the well being of FOP patients because it progressively interferes 
with, and limits, multiple body functions including walking, bending, breathing, mastication, 
and swallowing. Since Palovarotene inhibits the chondrogenic stage of heterotopic 
endochondral ossification, to be effective Palovarotene treatment would be needed at each 
flare-up to reduce or possibly prevent each new round of HO, possibly starting from a young 
age. Once formed, HO is permanent in FOP patients; the ectopic bone cannot be removed by 
surgery because the resulting tissue damage triggers additional episodes of HO(29). Given 
the potency of Palovarotene to prevent HO, this drug has the potential to suppress HO 
initiation following surgery in FOP patients, a therapeutic feat if indeed possible. Notably, 
the complete recovery of growth plate structure and function that we observe in 
Palovarotene-treated mutants supports the possibility that drug treatment of skeletally-
immature patients might enable suppression of HO during childhood while restoring skeletal 
growth, an attainment that originally seemed counter-intuitive with an RARγ agonist.
The goal of the present study was to test whether Palovarotene can block HO elicited by the 
human Acvr1 R206H mutation and whether this treatment could also correct skeletal defects 
caused by this mutation in FOP patients. The data presented demonstrate that Palovarotene 
is in fact able to do so and, quite significantly, appears to be able to act on neonates via the 
mother’s milk. While the cellular mechanisms through which Palovarotene and Acvr1 
R206H operate remain to be elucidated in further detail, these findings are a major step in 
establishing an effective and preventative treatment for FOP, possibly administrable from 
infancy.
