C
raniofacial cleft anomalies are common, affecting 1 in
600 live births annually.1 However, cleft lip and/or
palate (CL/P) disproportionately affects newborns in
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) owing to sub-
standard nutrition and a lack of prenatal care.2,3 Infants born
with CL/P in LMICs face significant barriers to treatment,
which often lead to prolonged disfigurement, social stigma,
speech impairment, and feeding difficulty that may result in
malnutrition and even death.4-6 Although CL/P is a complex
condition that benefits from comprehensive care, the provi-
sion of safe, timely, and effective surgery helps to achieve a
successful outcome.5,6
Like other LMICs, India lacks reliable documentation of
birth anomalies7; thus, accurate estimates of the burden of
CL/P in India are few.4 A multicenter hospital-based study of
94 610 births8 reported that the incidence of CL/P was 9.3
per 10 000 births and the incidence of cleft palate was 1.7 per
10 000 births. Khajanchi et al4 performed a population-
based assessment of the unmet need for CL/P treatment in a
single district. They reported a CL/P incidence of 7.3 per
10 000 live births. With a crude birth rate of 200 per 10 000
population and 1.25 billion people, as many as 3 infants with
CL/P are born in India every hour. The proportion of these
cases that receive safe, timely, and effective surgical care
IMPORTANCE The unmet need for cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) care in India is significant.
However, estimates required for CL/P care program planning are lacking.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the unmet need for CL/P surgery in India at the state level.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS To determine the proportion of individuals with CL/P
who presented for care in India, data were used from patients who received care at Operation
Smile programs in 12 low- and middle-income countries from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014.
The resulting model describes the prevalent unmet need for cleft surgery in India by state and
includes patients older than the surgery target ages of 1 and 2 years for cleft lip and cleft
palate repair, respectively. Next, the total number of unrepaired CL/P cases in each state was
estimated using state-level economic and health system indicators.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalent unmet need for CL/P repair.
RESULTS In the 28 states with available data, an estimated 72 637 cases of unrepaired CL/P
(uncertainty interval, 58 644-97 870 cases) were detected. The percentage of individuals
with unrepaired CL/P who were older than the respective target ages ranged from 37.0%
(95% CI, 30.6%-43.8%) in Goa to 65.8% (95% CI, 60.3%-70.9%) in Bihar (median, 57.9%;
interquartile range, 52.6%-63.4%). The rate of unrepaired CL/Ps ranged from less than 3.5
per 100 000 population in Kerala and Goa to 10.9 per 100 000 population in Bihar (median
rate, 5.9 [interquartile range, 4.6-7.3] per 100 000 population).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An estimated 72 000 cases of unrepaired CL/P are found in
India. Poor states with less health care infrastructure have exceptionally high rates (eg, Bihar).
These estimates are useful for informing international and national CL/P care strategies,
allocating resources, and advocating for individuals and families affected by CL/P more
broadly.

remains unknown. Nonetheless, the large volume of inci-
dent cases with CL/P requires significant and sustained
efforts to control the surgical burden of this condition.
Althoughtheseestimatesareuseful,theyarelikelynotrep-
resentative of the population more broadly. Hospital-based
studies do not capture individuals with CL/P who died, were
killed, did not seek care, or could not reach care.9 Although
population-based studies are superior, the one aforemen-
tioned study4 was conducted in only 1 district and did not use
random sampling. Given the mosaic of socioeconomic dispari-
ties and health service capabilities between and within states
in India, an estimate from a single district cannot be extrapo-
lated to the entire country.10-12 As an example, the Human De-
velopment Index—which is a composite score of life expec-
tancy at birth, mean years of schooling, and gross national
income per capita—ranges from 0.83 in Kerala to 0.43 in Chhat-
tisgarh. For reference, those values are similar to the Human
Development Indexes of Portugal and Liberia, respectively.13
Therefore, the lack of accurate and granular estimates handi-
caps informed health system planning and CL/P care pro-
gram development.
To address this gap, we aimed to build on previously pub-
lished methods for modeling condition prevalence from inci-
dent cases to estimate the unmet need for CL/P surgery in each
state in India using global data from Operation Smile
projects.14-17Specifically,wedevelopedamodelusingdatafrom
12 Operation Smile programs to estimate the proportion of in-
dividuals with unrepaired CL/P who were older than the tar-
get ages of 1 and 2 years for surgical repair of cleft lip and cleft
palate, respectively, relative to the total number of unre-
paired cases. We then used model outputs and state-level in-
dicators to estimate the total unmet need for CL/P surgery in
each state in India. By doing so, we hoped to provide accurate
estimates to inform local and international CL/P care pro-
gram strategies.
Methods
Data Sources
We obtained deidentified data from 12 Operation Smile pro-
grams that operated in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East,
Asia, and India from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014, from the
Operation Smile medical records department. Ages at presen-
tation of patients who sought primary CL/P repair and the cleft
condition (ie, isolated cleft lip, isolated cleft palate, or both)
were extracted. The institutional review board of Operation
Smileapprovedtheuseofroutinelycollected,deidentifieddata
for this study (ie, patient age at presentation, cleft condition).
Patients or their parents or guardians provided written in-
formed consent for the use of their deidentified data for re-
search. The decision to sign or refuse informed consent had
no bearing on the ability to receive care or the eligibility to re-
cover indirect financial losses. Patients who did not consent
to the use of their data for research were excluded from the
analysis.
Significant efforts were made before and during each mis-
sion to remove potential barriers to care for all individuals with
CL/P in the program country. Efforts were developed in part-
nership with in-country Operation Smile staff and volunteers
and were tailored to the program context. Approaches in-
cluded extensive use of local media channels (eg, radio) for pa-
tient mobilization, provision of travel subsidies, and partner-
ship with community-based organizations that assisted with
patient identification. Although these data may be subject to
residualbarrierstocare,thesepatientscanbeconsideredacon-
venience sample of individuals with unrepaired CL/P; this
population is characteristically hidden by other epidemio-
logic methods.18
Surgical Age Targets
Cases were divided into those with unrepaired cleft lip with
or without cleft palate (CL±P) and cleft palate with or without
cleft lip (CP±L). Patients were assigned a binary classification
(timely or late presentation) based on age at screening and ac-
cepted ages for timely CL/P care in LMICs.19-23 For CL±P, late
presentation was defined as the patient being older than 1 year.
For CP±L, late presentation was defined as the patient being
older than 2 years. Cleft lip and/or palate among individuals
older than these surgical target ages were considered and
termed the prevalent unmet need.
Country-Level Indicators
Using published reports and input from CL/P health care pro-
fessionals from more than 20 LMICs during an Operation Smile
conference, 15 country-level indicators were selected as can-
didate proxies for the availability of CL/P care in LMICs (eg, Hu-
man Development Index, gross domestic product per capita,
percentage of rural population, cesarean section rate, or num-
ber of health care workers per population).8,24 The candidate
indicators were extracted from the World Health Organiza-
tion’
sGlobalHealthObservatoryDataRepositoryandtheWorld
Bank’
s DataBank.25-27
Model Building
Two separate analyses were conducted: one for CL±P and an-
other for CP±L. First, patient age was described and distribu-
tions of country-level covariates were assessed with box plots.
Next, we performed 1-way logistic regressions and created lo-
cally weighted scatterplot smoothing lines for each candi-
datecountry-levelindicatortocharacterizeitsassociationwith
the odds of a patient being older than the respective surgical
age thresholds. The relationship between patient age and cae-
sarian section rate beyond 25% and 22% for CL±P and CP±L,
respectively, was irregular; therefore, spline terms were cre-
ated to model caesarian section rates above and below this
value.
Using a bidirectional stepwise model-building tech-
nique, we fit a logit link function to represent the proportion
of individuals with CL/P who presented beyond the 1- and
2-year surgical age targets for cleft lip and cleft palate repair,
respectively. Models were selected using the Akaike informa-
tion criterion.28
The models were validated by regression diagnostics, in-
cluding analyses of Pearson residuals, leverage, and influ-
ence (ie, change in Pearson χ2 value and change in β vector).

0.67 [P = .38, Pearson χ2 test]; CP±L receiver operating char-
acteristic curve, 0.65 [P = .93, Pearson χ2 test]).
State-Level Extrapolation
Data for state-level indicator covariates were collected from
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development11 and the India National Family and Health
Survey12 for each state except Telagana, for which no data
were available. The Indian state indicators were similar to
and always within the range of the indicators from the 12
Operation Smile project countries used to build the model
(Table 1). We then modeled the proportion of the prevalent
unmet need for CL/P surgery from the total unmet need for
CL/P surgery in each state (ie, the proportion of each state’
s
population with unrepaired CL/P that is older than the
respective surgical target age).
Estimation of Incident Unmet Need
The resulting values were combined with published CL/P
prevalence among live births in India and state-level infant
mortality rates to estimate the total surgical backlog in each
state.7,12 We assumed that children with CL±P would not
receive cleft lip surgery before 3 months of age and children
with CP±L would not receive cleft palate surgery before 1
year of age.29,30 We then used the model extrapolations to
estimate the percentage of potential CL/P surgical candi-
dates under the relative target age thresholds. States were
sorted by modeled values and separated into quintiles. In
the top quintile, we assumed that 90% of potential surgical
candidates received surgery, and, similarly, 80% for the sec-
ond, 70% for the third, 60% for the fourth, and 50% for the
lowest. This estimation was performed separately for CL±P
and CP±L. Although only approximations, these conserva-
tive estimates are supported by the available evidence.4,31
Estimation of Total Unmet Need
After estimating the incident unmet need (ie, the number of
CL/P cases younger than the respective surgical target age),
we used the state-specific values from the model to calcu-
late the prevalent unmet need. Adding the incident and
prevalent unmet needs yielded the total number of people
with CP±L and CL±P in need of surgery. The estimated rate
of unrepaired CL±P per 100 000 population was calculated
using 2016 state population projections from the Population
Foundation of India.32
Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis
We performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to evaluate
the reliability of our findings across the range of potential
inputs used in the model and final estimate calculations.
Prevalence rates of CL±P and CP±L were randomly varied
across a uniform distribution with a low (75%) and a high
(125%) estimate of each extrapolated value. Similarly, the
modeled proportions were randomly varied on a logarith-
mic distribution using the variables generated by the model
as described above. The rates of CL/P repair for the incident
need were randomly varied on a β distribution with an SD of
10%. Population, birth rate, and infant mortality rate were
held constant. Last, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation
to simultaneously vary each input over its respective distri-
bution and calculate the outcome for each state over 1000
simulations.
We calculated median values of the total CL±P and CP±L
surgical backlog and interquartile ranges (IQRs) from the ag-
gregated outcomes for each state. The IQRs represent the un-
certainty interval (UI) around each estimate. All statistical
analyses were completed in STATA/IC (version 13; StataCorp
LP) and Excel (version 2011; Microsoft Corporation).
Results
Proportion of Patients Older Than CL/P Surgical
Target Ages
Using these models, we estimated the percentage of indi-
viduals with unrepaired CL±P and CP±L who were older than
the respective surgical age targets in each state (ie, ≥1 year for
CL±P; ≥2 years for CP±L) (Table 2). For both groups, the per-
centage ranged from 37.0% (95% CI, 30.6%-43.8%) in Goa to
65.8% (95% CI, 60.3%-70.9%) in Bihar (median, 57.9%; IQR,
52.6%-63.4%).

Estimates of Unmet Need
In 28 of the 29 states in India with available data, we esti-
mated 72 637 cases of unrepaired CL/P (interquartile range
[IQR], 58 644-97 870) (Table 3). We found an estimated 61 716
cases of unrepaired CL±P (IQR, 47 945-86 783) and 10 333 cases
of unrepaired CP±L (95% CI, 8756-12 302) in the country.
The unmet need for cleft lip surgery ranged from only 22
cases (IQR, 18-29) in Sikkim to 10 349 (IQR, 7699-15 647) in Ut-
tarPradesh.Similarly,wefoundonly3casesofunrepairedcleft
palate (IQR, 3-4) in Sikkim compared with 1884 cases (IQR,
1566-2247) in Uttar Pradesh.
The rate of unrepaired CL/P ranged from 3.1 to 10.9 per
100 000 population in Goa and Bihar, respectively (median,
5.9; IQR, 4.6-7.3) (Figure). The rate of unrepaired CL±P ranged
from less than 3.5 per 100 000 population in Goa, Tamil Nadu,
andKeralato9.5per100 000populationinBihar(median,5.0;
IQR, 4.0-6.2). The rate of unrepaired CP±L ranged from 0.5 or
less per 100 000 population in Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil
Nadu,Kerala,andSikkimto1.5per100 000populationinBihar
(median, 0.8; IQR, 0.6-1.0).
Discussion
This study aimed to estimate the unmet need for CL/P sur-
gery in each state in India and to inform CL/P care program
strategies. The estimated proportion of individuals with CL/P
who are older than the surgical age targets for LMICs varies
nearly 2-fold between states in India, suggesting marked dis-
parity in socioeconomic status and access to CL/P care ser-
vices across the country. With more than 72 000 cases of un-
repaired CL/P in India, significant efforts must be made to
relieve the prevalent unmet need and strengthen health care
services to meet the demand of new cases so that the surgical
backlog does not grow. These state-level estimates might aid
in determining the optimal mix of intervention strategies for
specific states (eg, short-term mission, creating a comprehen-
sive care center and/or attempting eradication of prevalent un-
met need), allocating resources, and advocating for individu-
als and families affected by CL/P in India more broadly.
To our knowledge, no large population-based studies of
CL/P epidemiology in India exist to put these findings into con-
text. However, the previously mentioned population-based
survey of met and unmet CL/P care needs in Gujarat is
informative.4 The survey was performed in the Patan district
of Gujarat. Using a snowball sampling technique, the investi-
gators reported a CL/P prevalence of 10 per 100 000 popula-
tion. Of these, 68% had received an operation, meaning that
3.2per100 000hadnotreceivedanoperation.GiventhatCL/Ps
in the Patan district are treated by a nongovernmental orga-
nization and a CL/P care–capable health care system, our Gu-
jarat CL/P estimate of 5.4 per 100 000 population is reason-
able. Other issues might explain the potential differences
between the 2 estimates. For example, the Patan district study
might have missed some CL/P cases during sampling. In ad-
dition, potential variations in the CL/P incidence or access to
surgical care between districts in Gujarat might also contrib-
ute to the differences between the Patan district and our state-
level estimate. Although this single data point cannot vali-
date our estimates, it suggests that they are reasonable and can
be used to identify states with a particularly large CL/P bur-
den and those where the eradication of prevalent unmet need
might be feasible.
These findings follow the relationship between delivery
of surgical care and governance, security, and multisector de-
velopment. States that have been most affected by corrup-
tion and insurgency and that have populations with poor ac-
cesstoeducationandhealthserviceshavehighestimatedrates
ofunrepairedCL/P(eg,Bihar,Jharkhand,Meghalaya,Nagaland,
and Uttar Pradesh).33-35 Similarly, these states have a particu-
larly rigid caste system, which perpetuates misconceptions
about CL/P and ostracizes those affected, thus adding to ex-
isting barriers to care.36-39 Consequently, CL/P-related ne-
glect, abandonment, and infanticide in these communities
exist.40,41 On the other hand, states that have had strong po-
litical support for development, have not been affected by con-
flict, and have value equity have markedly lower estimated
rates of unrepaired CL/P (eg, Kerala, Goa, and Andhra
Pradesh).42,43 Health care does not exist in a vacuum; efforts

to improve access to safe and timely surgery require concur-
rent support of and advocacy for good governance, security,
and development more broadly.44,45
The burden of CL/P in India may benefit from a data-
driven approach to developing the optimal mix of interven-
tion strategies. For example, several states have a relatively
small backlog and low rate of unrepaired CL/P (ie, <250 cases
and <6 per 100 000 population, respectively; eg, Tripura, Goa,
Sikkim). These states could be targeted for backlog eradica-
tion, which might be accomplished by a combination of local
and international short-term, mission-based surgical
programs.46 Once the backlog is eradicated, local health care
systems might be able to keep pace with incident CL/P cases
and prevent new accumulation of surgical backlog. However,
other states have a large number and high rate of unrepaired
CL/P (ie, >4000 cases and >7 per 100 000 population, respec-
tively; eg, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan). In addi-
tion to short-term, mission-based surgical programs, these
states might also benefit from the development of compre-
hensive care centers and long-term support of local health care
systems to decrease the significant surgical backlog and pro-
vide timely care for new cases.46,47 Comprehensive care cen-
ters are permanent, provide sustainable multidisciplinary cleft
care, build local capacity, and have greater cost-effective-
ness, given the high case volume, than short-term mission-
basedprograms.48Therefore,inareaswithlargeburdens,com-
prehensive care centers may be particularly cost-effective and
clinically effective. In short, these data might be useful for de-
veloping targeted CL/P care program strategies that are com-
mensuratewithorganizationalcapacityandgoalsandlocalun-
met surgical needs.
By building our model around the age at which patients
presented for primary CL/P repair at surgical programs, these
estimatesreflectthebarrierstocarefacedbychildrenwithCL/P
and their families. States with a high estimated proportion of
children who present well beyond the surgical target ages rep-
resent unique opportunities to identify and address barriers
to CL/P care (eg, Bihar). These barriers often include prohibi-
tively expensive direct and/or indirect costs of care, insuffi-
cient understanding about the condition and its treatability,
a lack of capable health care facilities, and severe social stigma.
In Ghana, barriers to essential surgical care were quantified
usingacomprehensiveassessmenttool.39Theresearcherswere
abletoidentifymultipleanddifferentbarrierstocarethatwere

to address them. Similar tools, tailored to local contexts, could

beusedtodeterminethespecificchallengesfacedbythosewith
CL/P in India so that such challenges can be remedied. Severe
stigma around CL/P remains a problem in India.49 Numerous
reports of abandonment of infants with CL/P and infanticide
in India50,51 demonstrate a lack of knowledge regarding the
causesofCL/P,itstreatabilityandfunctionalrecovery,andpoor
access to care as challenges remaining to be overcome.
Although these estimates were generated from a robust
analysis, several limitations should be considered when
interpreting the results. First, the data from which the mod-
els were built came from 11 countries in addition to India.
Thus, they may not represent the Indian context accurately.
However, sufficient data from solely Indian projects were not
available. Second, several assumptions were used to create
these estimates. However, each assumption was based on the
best available evidence. In addition, the probabilistic sensi-
tivity analysis confirmed estimate stability across the range
and distributions of each of the variables included in our cal-
culations. Third, the findings represent state-level estimates.
Significant inequity remains in surgical care access within
states, which may differentially affect certain high-risk sub-
populations (eg, extremely poor and/or rural inhabitants,
racial or religious minorities). Thus, CL/P care programs
should consider efforts to identify particularly vulnerable
individuals and redress the barriers to surgical care that they
face. Fourth, these estimates do not reflect the effect of local
and/or international CL/P care programs on the backlog of
unrepaired CL/P. Thus, programs should consider the pres-
ence or absence of these efforts, past and present, when
planning CL/P care interventions. Last, Telangana did not
have data available for model extrapolation; the state cer-
tainly has a significant unmet need for CL/P surgery. Telan-
gana should not be forgotten during program priority setting.
Despite these limitations, the estimates allow reasonable
conclusions to be made about the unmet need for CL/P sur-
gery in India and can be used to help inform the strategy of
programs to provide surgical CL/P care.
Conclusions
Our model estimated more than 72 000 cases of unrepaired
CL/P in India. Although the most populated states had the larg-
est number of unrepaired CL/Ps (eg, Uttar Pradesh), poor states
with less health care infrastructure have exceptionally high
rates (eg, Bihar, Nagaland). To address this burden, local and
international CL/P care programs could use these estimates of
the number and the rate of unrepaired cases in their area to
inform their goals (eg, backlog reduction, backlog eradica-
tion,andmeetingtheincidentdemand)andstrategy(eg,short-

Expanding Roles and Broader Goals for Global Surgery
Travis T. Tollefson, MD, MPH; David Shaye, MD
Global surgery is an emerging field within the widely known
umbrellatermofglobalhealth.Alackofdataonsurgicallytreat-
able disease states has been the biggest barrier to the neces-
sary support and investments in global surgery. Most public
health priorities address spe-
cificdiseases(eg,malaria,hu-
man immunodeficiency vi-
rus, tuberculosis), whereas
global surgery has only recently gained attention. Surgical vol-
unteerismisverypopular,butthemorecomplextasksofwork-
ing with local health care systems in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs) are more difficult.1 Leadership and repre-
sentation in public health arenas are needed to move the field
toward the goal of “universal access to safe, affordable surgi-
cal and anesthesia care when needed. “2(p834)
With its roots in decades of volunteer wartime, disaster re-
sponse, and humanitarian surgical teams (eg, Red Cross,
Medicins Sans Frontières), global surgery encompasses the
complex system of delivering safe and effective surgical care
in resource-poor environments. The advertisements in major
media sources call for donations to support nongovernmen-
tal organizations, which focus on a single, major, surgically
treatable condition (eg, cataract, cleft lip and/or palate [CL/
P], hernias). However, behind the scenes, a groundswell of sur-
geons,anesthesiologists,andsurgicalteamshaveacquiredfor-
mal public health training and worked to identify effective
globalsurgeryprograms,whichmaybereplicatedinothersites.
As an example, a creative approach to prevent surgeons from
needing to emigrate to more lucrative countries is to provide
specialized business management support and loans, to boost
the private surgical care sectors in LMICs.
Theimpactoftheeffortsofglobalsurgicalteams,research-
ers,andpolicymakersisincreasinglymeasuredandreported.1-5
Current and future efforts by the international surgical com-
munity are slowly coalescing into more synergistic and for-
ward-thinking stakeholders.
The Lancet Commission and a collective of others outline
how the goal of global surgery “saves lives, prevents disabil-
ity, and promotes economic growth.
”2(p569) First, we must un-
derstand the global burden of surgical disease, simply de-
fined as where and how much surgical disease is untreated. An
estimated 5 billion people lack access to safe, affordable sur-
geryandanesthesiaworldwide,whilethegapforadditionalsur-
gical procedures reaches 143 million per year in LMICs.2 Al-
thoughpreviouslyconsideredapoorinvestment,globalsurgery
is increasingly noted to be cost-effective. For example, with-
out access to basic trauma and orthopedic care, young pa-
tients are disabled and removed from their country’
s national
economy. The solution is complex and includes a tiered re-
sponserangingfromshort-termvisitingsurgicalbrigadestoim-
provement in overall surgical health care delivery systems.
In this issue of JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery, Stewart et al6
seek to estimate the prevalent unmet need for surgery to ad-
dress CL/P in states of India using modeling. The authors used
existing incident data from children presenting to the screen-
ing clinics of a well-known international CL/P charity in 12
countries. The number of live births with CL/P in any country
or region can be estimated by (1) direct live-birth measure-
ment, (2) household surveys conducted in a randomized fash-
ion, or (3) incidence data used to predict prevalence.3 The ma-
jor barriers to simply counting cases in these diverse
communities include the frequency of home births and mid-
wifery, as well as a lack of database resources and workforce.
The modeling techniques used by the authors allow ex-
trapolation of the unmet need. These predictions must be con-
sidered in the face of differing cultural, socioeconomic, and
