The Golgi apparatus lies at the heart of the secretory pathway
where it is required for secretory trafficking and cargo modifica-
tion. Disruption of Golgi architecture and function has been widely
observed in neurodegenerative disease, but whether Golgi dys-
function is causal with regard to the neurodegenerative process,
or is simply a manifestation of neuronal death, remains unclear.
Here we report that targeted loss of the golgin GM130 leads to
a profound neurological phenotype in mice. Global KO of mouse
GM130 results in developmental delay, severe ataxia, and postnatal
death. We further show that selective deletion of GM130 in neurons
causes fragmentation and defective positioning of the Golgi appara-
tus, impaired secretory trafficking, and dendritic atrophy in Purkinje
cells. These cellular defects manifest as reduced cerebellar size and
Purkinje cell number, leading to ataxia. Purkinje cell loss and ataxia
first appear during postnatal development but progressively worsen
with age. Our data therefore indicate that targeted disruption of the
mammalian Golgi apparatus and secretory traffic results in neuronal
degeneration in vivo, supporting the view that Golgi dysfunction can
play a causative role in neurodegeneration.
GM130 | Golgi apparatus | polarized secretion | Purkinje cell | ataxia
A
s an important compartment of the endomembrane system,
the Golgi apparatus is present in all eukaryotic cells. The
Golgi apparatus lies at the heart of the secretory pathway and
plays a critical role in the posttranslational modification and
trafficking of secretory cargo proteins and lipids (1). In addition
to these core functions, the Golgi apparatus also contributes to
cell cycle regulation and cytoskeletal dynamics (2–4). The Golgi
apparatus has a characteristic architecture, comprising one or
more stacks of cisternae that in vertebrate cells are laterally
connected to form the Golgi ribbon (5, 6). The vertebrate Golgi
is typically positioned adjacent to the centrosome, a localization
that is dependent upon interactions with microtubules and the
microtubule motor protein dynein (7). In migrating cells or in
polarized cells such as neurons, the Golgi is positioned toward
the leading edge or apical dendrite, respectively, allowing po-
larized delivery of secretory cargo to these plasma membrane
domains (8–10). In developing neurons, the Golgi can also exist
as noncentrosomally associated outposts, thought to be impor-
tant for localized delivery of cargo direct to the newly forming
dendritic plasma membrane as well as local microtubule nucle-
ation to support dendrite morphogenesis (11–14).
Although the Golgi apparatus is well characterized at the
molecular level, its roles in development and in tissue homeo-
stasis, and how its dysfunction contributes to disease, remain
relatively poorly characterized. For example, we know that the
Golgi apparatus undergoes fragmentation in many neurodegen-
erative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s dis-
ease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and spinocerebellar
ataxia type 2 (SCA2) (15–19). However, whether Golgi frag-
mentation or impairment of secretory traffic in neurons can cause
neurodegeneration, or simply reflects a consequence of cell death,
remains unclear (20). Several studies have shown that polarized
membrane delivery via the Golgi apparatus is important for
neuronal morphogenesis during brain development (8–10, 21), but
whether impairment of this process can cause neuronal death with
consequent neurological impairment in vivo is currently unknown.
Members of the golgin family of coiled-coil proteins are re-
quired for maintenance of Golgi organization and are important
for the specificity and efficiency of membrane traffic at the Golgi
apparatus (22, 23). One of the best-studied golgins, GM130 (also
known as GOLGA2), contributes to Golgi ribbon morphology
and can tether transport vesicles to facilitate endoplasmic re-
ticulum (ER) to Golgi traffic (24–27). It has also been implicated
in Golgi positioning and cytoskeletal regulation (4, 28) and can
contribute to the organization of neuronal Golgi outposts, at
least in Drosophila (13). However, the physiological importance
and in vivo functions of GM130 have yet to be explored in
a mammal.
Here, we generated GM130 knockout (KO) mice and investi-
gated the consequences of GM130 loss upon Golgi architecture
and function within the nervous system. We find that loss of
GM130 leads to disrupted organization and altered positioning of
the Golgi apparatus in cerebellar Purkinje cells, which is accom-
panied by impaired polarized trafficking to the apical dendrite.
Importantly, we find that these cellular defects manifest as a loss
of Purkinje cell viability and progressive cerebellar atrophy,
leading to ataxia. Our findings therefore indicate that disruption
Significance
It has been known for many years that the Golgi apparatus, the
central organelle of the secretory pathway, is fragmented
upon neurodegenerative disease. However, it has remained an
open question whether Golgi disruption contributes to neu-
ronal death, as seen in disease, or is simply a consequence of
this process. Here, we show that knocking out the Golgi pro-
tein GM130 in mice causes Golgi fragmentation and impaired
secretory trafficking in Purkinje neurons, resulting in cell death
and ataxia. The cell death and ataxia are first observed in
postnatal development, but worsen with age. These findings
indicate that targeted disruption of the Golgi apparatus can
result in neuronal loss in vivo, supporting the view that Golgi
dysfunction can contribute to neurodegeneration.

Results
Generation of GM130 KO Mice. To determine the physiological
importance of GM130 in vivo, we generated a global KO mouse
(GM130−/−) by homologous recombination (Fig. S1). The GM130−/−
mice, which lacked detectable GM130 (Fig. 1A), were born at a
normal Mendelian ratio, indicating GM130 is not essential for
embryonic development. However, deletion of GM130 resulted in
reduced growth (Fig. 1 B and C) and death before postnatal day
35 (P35) (Fig. 1D).
To explore how loss of GM130 causes growth retardation and
death, the temporal expression of GM130 in different mouse
organs was examined. We found that GM130 is highly expressed
in the brain of newborn mice (P3), and although widely expressed,
it is particularly abundant in liver, pancreas, and lung during
postnatal development (P14) (Fig. 1E). To determine how organ-
specific loss of GM130 affects postnatal development, we gener-
ated conditional KO mice in which GM130 was selectively knocked
out in brain, pancreas, or lung (Fig. S2). Postnatal development
and survival of mice were not affected in mice lacking GM130 in
either the pancreas or lung (Fig. 1F), although GM130 was highly
expressed in these organs. However, when GM130 was deleted in
the brain by crossing GM130fl/fl with mice bearing a Nestin-Cre
transgene, which is expressed throughout the nervous system (29),
the neuron-specific KO offspring (GM130-nKO mice) showed
significant growth retardation (Fig. 1F). This result indicates that
GM130 expression in the brain is required for normal growth in
mice. The GM130-nKO mice were able to breed and did not show
reduced survival relative to GM130fl/fl [control mice (Ctrl)] litter-
mates up to 1.5 y of age. The growth retardation observed in
GM130-nKO mice was less than that in GM130−/− mice, suggesting
that GM130 has functions in cell types beyond those in which
Nestin-Cre is active.
Motor Defects in GM130 KO Mice. The GM130−/− mice displayed a
striking ataxia phenotype (Movie S1 and Fig. S3A). The mice
staggered and could not stand steady on their hind legs, indi-
cating GM130 is required for proper motor control during
postnatal development. Consistent with the ataxia phenotype
seen in GM130−/− mice, GM130-nKO mice also displayed motor
coordination defects (Movie S2). These were mild in young an-
imals but progressively worsened with age (Movie S3), and
tremor was obvious. The GM130-nKO mice also displayed a limp
reflex when lifted by their tail (Fig. 2A), consistent with a neu-
rodegenerative defect (30). A footprint assay revealed an ataxic
walking gait and diminished stride (Fig. 2 B and C). In contrast,
both Nestin-Cre transgenic mice and GM130fl/fl mice did not
display any motor abnormalities. To assess motor coordination
quantitatively, the GM130-nKO mice and control littermates
were subjected to rotarod testing. In multiple trails, GM130-nKO
mice showed a slight reduction in time spent on the rotarod at 3 wk
of age (Fig. 2D), which was much more profound at 8 and 12 wk
of age (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3 B–D). GM130-nKO mice also
needed a longer time to cross balance beams of multiple sizes
(Fig. 2 F and G). Together, these results indicate that deletion of
GM130 in the central nervous system leads to severe neurological
dysfunction.
Progressive Cerebellar Atrophy and Purkinje Cell Loss in GM130-nKO
Mice. To reveal the basis of the motor phenotype of GM130-nKO
mice, adult brains from GM130fl/fl and GM130-nKO mice were
analyzed. No gross changes in brain architecture were observed
in the forebrain or midbrain of GM130-nKO mice; however, the
cerebellar size was dramatically reduced (Fig. 3 A and B).

CELL BIOLOGY
 Therefore, we focused our attention on the cerebellum. Histo-
logical analysis by Nissl staining revealed a dramatic loss of
Purkinje cells in adult GM130-nKO cerebellum (Fig. 3C). By
comparing the cerebellum at different ages, we found that loss of
Purkinje cells, marked by antibodies to calbindin-D28K, began in
the third postnatal week, most noticeably from lobules X and IX
(Fig. 3 D–F), with Purkinje cell degeneration occurring in other
regions as the mice became older (Fig. S4 A–C). In contrast to
Purkinje cells, there was no degeneration of neurons within the
molecular or granule layers of the cerebellum (Fig. S4D). The
results indicate a progressive cerebellar atrophy and degenera-
tion of Purkinje cells in the GM130-nKO mice, as opposed to a
neurogenesis defect occurring early in development. The pro-
gressive degeneration of Purkinje cells correlated with impaired
motor function, which was also progressive in nature (Fig. 2 and
Fig. S3 B–D). The loss of Purkinje cells in the GM130-nKO mice
also correlated with a significant decrease in the thickness of the
molecular layer (Fig. 3F) and increased staining of the astrocyte
marker GFAP, consistent with neuronal damage, in cerebellar
regions where Purkinje cell loss occurred (Fig. 3G). Staining for
the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase 3 indicated that there
was significant apoptotic cell death of Purkinje neurons in the
GM130-nKO mice (Fig. S5 A and B). Consistent with the Pur-
kinje cell loss observed in the GM130-nKO mice, the global
deletion of GM130 also resulted in dramatically reduced num-
bers of Purkinje cells (Fig. S5C).
Disruption of Golgi Architecture and Positioning upon GM130 KO.
Studies in cultured cells have revealed a role for GM130 in
maintaining mammalian Golgi ribbon organization and peri-
centrosomal positioning (25, 31). GM130 also participates in
vesicle tethering during ER-to-Golgi traffic (24, 26, 27), and can
function as a scaffold for activation of Cdc42 or Stk25 that is
relevant for cell migration (32–34). To elucidate the cellular
basis of the ataxic phenotype and Purkinje cell degeneration of
GM130-nKO mice, we used antibodies to golgin-84 and TGN38,
markers of the cis and trans-Golgi respectively, to analyze Golgi
structure in Purkinje cells from mice at ages of P8, P14 and P28
by immunostaining. Purkinje cells from control mice at all ages
had an elaborate Golgi ribbon, with Golgi elements extending
around the nucleus of the cell soma, whereas loss of GM130
resulted in a compaction of the Golgi apparatus at P14 and P28
(Fig. 4 A and B and see Fig. S8). Changes in Golgi ultrastructure
in the Purkinje cells were clearly observed using transmission
electron microscopy with a loss of cisternal stacking and cisternal
length and an accumulation of vesicular profiles localized to the
perinuclear region (Fig. 4 C and D). These results are consistent
with our observations in GM130−/− mouse embryonic fibroblast
(MEF) cells (Fig. S6). A similar disruption of Golgi architecture
was seen in granule cells within the cerebellum of the GM130-
nKO mice, and also in nonneuronal cell types in the GM130−/−
mice, indicating that GM130 is important for maintaining Golgi
organization in many cell types in vivo (Fig. S7).
In WT mice at P8 we observed Golgi outposts in primary
dendrites of Purkinje cells, as expected from other studies (8–10,
21). The outposts were absent from Purkinje cells lacking GM130,
which is consistent with results in Drosophila (13). Interestingly,
Golgi outposts were not observed in Purkinje cell dendrites at P14
and P28, even in WT mice (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the Golgi
apparatus undergoes dynamic changes in its dendritic localization
during neuronal development.
Importantly, we found that loss of GM130 altered the position
of the Golgi apparatus in the soma of Purkinje cells. In control
mice, although the Golgi ribbon extended around the nucleus, it
was enriched at the apical pole and extended to the initial seg-
ment of the primary dendrite, close to the molecular layer (Fig. 4
A, B, and E). In contrast, the Golgi was predominantly found at
the opposite side of the soma to the primary dendrite in GM130-
nKO mice at P14 and P28, indicating a loss of apical polarity of
the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4 A, B, and E). This finding is consistent
with the loss of Golgi polarity seen upon shRNA-mediated de-
pletion of GM130 from hippocampal granule cells (10). The
pericentrosomal positioning of the mammalian Golgi apparatus
helps determine its polarized distribution in various cell types (7).
To determine whether loss of GM130 results in altered associa-
tion of the Golgi with the centrosome in Purkinje cells, Golgi and
centrosome positioning were analyzed in parallel. As shown in Fig.
4F, in control mice the Golgi apparatus was closely associated
with the Purkinje cell centrosome, labeled with γ-tubulin, which
was located apically near the base of the primary dendrite. In
GM130-nKO mice, the centrosome retained its apical polarity,
but the Golgi apparatus was completely dissociated from it (Fig.
4F). A likely explanation for this effect is the loss of GM130
binding protein A kinase anchoring protein of 450 kDa (AKAP450),
which helps link the Golgi apparatus to the centrosome (35),
from the Golgi in the GM130-nKO Purkinje neurons (Fig. S8A).
In contrast, the Golgi association of Stk25, which has been im-
plicated in Golgi polarity (32), was retained in the absence of
GM130 (Fig. S8B). Together these results indicate that although
GM130 is not required for initial Golgi polarization, it is es-
sential to maintain the polarized distribution of the Golgi ap-
paratus in Purkinje cells, most likely through its association with
AKAP450 and the centrosome.

 Deficient Secretory Cargo Trafficking upon GM130 KO. The polarized
distribution of the Golgi apparatus in neuronal cells is required
for directed trafficking of secretory cargos into the dendrite,
which is important for dendritic growth during development (8–
10, 21). GM130 participates in ER-to-Golgi traffic (24, 26),
functioning as a tether for ER-derived transport vesicles (27).
Secretory trafficking was therefore analyzed in GM130 KO cells,
using the model cargo vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG)
fused to GFP. In both cultured primary MEFs and cerebellar
neurons, deletion of GM130 led to a reduced rate of trafficking of
VSVG–GFP from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5 A and B
and Fig. S9), indicating a role for GM130 in this trafficking step in
these cells. We then analyzed the morphology of dendrites in
Purkinje cells of the KO mice. In WT mice, an elaborate dendritic
tree was obvious at P9, and by P30 there was a dramatic expansion
of dendritic arbors, as expected (Fig. 5C). Dendritic morphology
was relatively normal at P9 in GM130-nKO mice (Fig. 5C), in-
dicating that GM130 is dispensable for initiation of dendrite for-
mation and initial growth of the dendritic tree. However, strikingly,
there was a dramatic reduction both in dendritic size and arbori-
zation in GM130-nKO Purkinje cells at P30 compared with WT
(Fig. 5C). Indeed the dendrite was smaller than that seen at P9,
indicating not only a failure to expand but also significant amount
of dendritic atrophy. Together these results indicate impaired se-
cretion and defective dendritic maintenance upon loss of GM130.
To further assess secretory trafficking in the cerebellum of
GM130-nKO mice, we focused on synaptic receptors that have to
transit the Golgi apparatus on their way to the neuronal plasma
membrane, where they function in neurotransmission (36, 37).
Levels of plasma membrane AMPA-type glutamate receptor
subunits were assessed by blotting the postsynaptic density (PSD)
fraction isolated from the cerebellum of GM130-nKO mice. There
were decreased amounts of both GluR1 and GluR2 in the PSD
fraction of the GM130-nKO mice compared with control, even
though total abundance was not affected (Fig. 5 D and E), consistent

 with impaired secretory traffic to the synaptic membrane. In support
of this conclusion, we found soma to dendritic trafficking of GluR1
was reduced in GM130-nKO Purkinje neurons (Fig. 5F). It has been
reported that decreased abundance of the GluR2 subunit can lead
to high Ca2+ influx (38), which can result in Purkinje cell death.
There was also reduced PSD95, which scaffolds several types of
neurotransmitter receptors including NMDA and AMPA-type glu-
tamate receptors at the postsynaptic membrane (39), in the PSD
fraction (Fig. 5 D and E). Reduced PSD95 can cause reduced
AMPA receptor abundance at the synapse and longer NMDA-
mediated long-term potentiation (40). Thus, defective neurotrans-
mission as a consequence of reduced neurotransmitter receptor
abundance and stability at the synapse is likely to contribute to im-
paired functionality and long-term survival of Purkinje cells in the
cerebellum of GM130-nKO mice.
Analysis of Golgins and GRASP65 in the Cerebellum. Given the
particular sensitivity of Purkinje neurons to loss of GM130, it was
of interest to assess relative levels of GM130 and related golgins,
in different neuronal types, both in control and GM130-nKO
mice. As shown in Fig. S8C, GM130 is expressed in Purkinje cells
and in neurons within the granule and molecular layers of con-
trol cells. The staining for GM130 was stronger in Purkinje cells,
reflecting the increased abundance of Golgi membranes in this
cell type. The same was true for two other golgins, golgin-84 and
TMF1, which are localized to the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi, respec-
tively (Fig. 4A and Fig. S8D). Similarly, staining for the cis-Golgi
golgin Golgi microtubule-associated protein of 210 kDa (GMAP210),
which, like GM130, also functions in ER-to-Golgi transport (27, 41),
was strong in Purkinje neurons, although harder to detect in other
neuronal types present within the cerebellum (Fig. S8E). In GM130-
nKO mice, the levels of the golgins studied were unaffected (Fig. 4A
and Fig. S8D), although there was a slight reduction in abundance
of GMAP210 (Fig. S8E). Golgi reassembly and stacking protein of
65 kDa (GRASP65), which is anchored to the Golgi membrane via
association with GM130 (25, 42), was present in Purkinje cells and
other neuronal types within the cerebellum of control mice. In
GM130-nKO mice, it was lost from the Golgi, as expected (Fig.
S8F). Together these results suggest that the particular sensitivity
of Purkinje cells to loss of GM130 is not due to a deficit in ex-
pression of other golgins or GRASP65 in this cell type.
Discussion
In this study we report that targeted KO of the golgin GM130 in
mice leads to degeneration of Purkinje neurons within the cer-
ebellum. Within Purkinje neurons, GM130 is required for Golgi
positioning via association with the centrosome, and for efficient
ER-to-Golgi trafficking (Fig. S10). Both processes are required
for polarized delivery of secretory cargo to the dendrite, which is
required for growth and maintenance of the dendritic tree. Loss
of GM130 leads to dendrite atrophy, Purkinje cell degeneration,
and generation of an ataxic phenotype in mice.
Previous work has shown that the polarized distribution of the
Golgi apparatus is required for dendritic initiation from the
soma and subsequent growth, a process that requires the delivery
of large amounts of newly synthesized plasma membrane com-
ponents via the secretory pathway (8, 21). Knockout of GM130
did not affect initiation or early growth of the Purkinje cell den-
drite, but was required for maintenance of the dendritic tree. This
finding suggests there is a higher requirement for directed secre-
tory traffic for the expansion and maintenance of the dendritic
tree, as opposed to its initial formation, at least in Purkinje cells.
GM130 impairs membrane delivery into the apical dendrite in two
ways: loss of Golgi positioning and lower rates of ER-to-Golgi
traffic, most likely due to defects in vesicle tethering.
A recent study reported that RNAi-mediated depletion of GM130
in hippocampal neurons results in mild impairment of dendritic
initiation (10). In contrast, we find that in Purkinje neurons, dendritic
initiation still occurs in the absence of GM130. Notably, we find
that Purkinje neurons are particularly susceptible to loss of
GM130 in vivo. The reason for this is currently unclear. A pos-
sible explanation is redundancy in golgin function, which may
vary between different types of neurons (22, 23). However, the
abundant Purkinje cell expression of other cis-Golgi golgins that
could in theory compensate for loss of GM130 argues against this
possibility. Rather, we favor the hypothesis that Purkinje cells are
particularly susceptible to perturbations of secretory traffic due
to their extremely large dendritic tree, which requires a signifi-
cant input of material for both its growth and its maintenance.
The relatively large amounts of Golgi in Purkinje cells would be
consistent with this idea. Interestingly, knockout of the GM130
binding partner GRASP65 in mice fails to elicit a phenotype
(43). This has been attributed to compensation by the related
protein GRASP55 (43), which does not interact with GM130
in vivo (44). Thus, even though loss of GM130 resulted in a failure
to recruit GRASP65 to the Golgi, the phenotypes we observe are
likely independent of GRASP65.
Cell-culture–based studies have implicated GM130 in a number
of cellular processes in addition to secretory trafficking, including
cytoskeletal regulation, which is important for cell migration and
cell division (4, 31, 33, 34). It was therefore surprising that the
GM130 KO mice did not display any overt developmental phe-
notype; pups were born at normal weight and looked morpho-
logically normal. These findings would appear inconsistent with a
major role for GM130 in cell migration or cell division in vivo,
processes that are particularly important during embryonic de-
velopment. However, an alternative explanation is that GM130
function in these processes is redundant, possibly with another
golgin, or that the developing animal can compensate for loss of
GM130 in a way not possible in cultured cells. Further studies
will be required to discriminate between these possibilities. In-
terestingly, a human patient with a loss-of-function GM130 mu-
tation has recently been described (45). This patient lacked any
neonatal phenotype, but developed neuromuscular defects in the
first year of life. Hence, in humans, it would seem GM130 is also
dispensable during embryonic development. It would also appear
that an important role for GM130 in the nervous system is con-
served between mice and humans.
How similar the neuronal degeneration we observe upon
GM130 KO is to that observed in progressive neurodegenerative
disease is currently unclear. The loss of Purkinje cells in the
GM130 KO mice starts around 3 wk into postnatal development
and progressively worsens as the mice age. The most common
neurodegenerative diseases typically manifest only later in life,
although the spinocerebellar ataxias, in which Purkinje cell death
is commonly observed, can appear much earlier in life (46). The
cellular phenotypes we observe in the GM130 KO mice could be
considered neurodevelopmental. Although Purkinje neurons are
born and specified before the time when phenotypes start to
manifest, in mice they continue to develop their dendritic tree
for up to 3 wk following birth (47, 48). Hence, a failure of Pur-
kinje cells to properly grow or maintain the dendritic tree during
the first weeks of postnatal development could explain the
neurological defects we observe. This is different from an in-
ability to maintain a fully formed dendritic network, as occurs
when mature neurons undergo degeneration in later onset dis-
ease. Nevertheless, the demonstration that Golgi dysfunction
causes neuronal loss in vivo, combined with the observation that
neuronal loss and ataxia worsen with age upon loss of GM130,
indicates that this process could, in principle, result in or at least
contribute to the neurodegeneration that occurs in human disease.
In support of this possibility, it has been shown that α-synuclein
can perturb ER-to-Golgi traffic in Parkinson’s disease models (49),
and that the Aβ-fragment of APP that causes Alzheimer’s disease,
and the pathogenic form of ataxin-2 that causes SCA2, both disrupt
Golgi organization (19, 50). Hence, Golgi dysfunction and defective

 secretory trafficking, which could be attributable to a number of
primary causes, may represent a significant pathogenic mechanism
of neurodegenerative disease in humans.
