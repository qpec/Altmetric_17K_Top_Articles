Introduction
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, involving chronic lung inflammation and narrowing of the 
small airways through a combination of excessive mucus production and smooth muscle contraction (1). It 
is characterized by recurrent dyspnea, wheezing, coughing, edema, and chest tightness and usually is asso-
ciated with reversible airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness (1). Moreover, severe asthma 
attacks can lead to life-threatening emergencies. Conventional treatments for asthma include antiinflamma-
tory products, such as inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene inhibitors, and short- and long-acting broncho-
dilators (2, 3). In some cases, symptoms that are difficult to control are managed with oral corticosteroids 
(OCS) in severe asthma patients (3). It is important to recognize that these treatments focus on managing 
the symptoms of the disease mainly by suppressing the proinflammatory immune responses and do not 
address the underlying causes of airway inflammation.
The pathogenesis of asthma involves various inflammatory immune cells and proinflammatory media-
tors (4). IgE is an antibody produced by B cells; it is critical for the onset and maintenance of both acute and 
chronic allergic diseases, including asthma (5). The vast majority of individuals with allergic asthma have 
elevated serum IgE levels (6). Because IgE is a key player in allergic asthma, it represents a prime target for 
therapeutic intervention. A monoclonal anti-IgE antibody (7), omalizumab, has shown to be effective in 
severe allergic asthma as well as in people with nonallergic asthma (7, 8). This blocking antibody mainly 
binds to free IgE antibody, preventing it from triggering an IgE-induced inflammatory reaction. However, 
this anti-IgE antibody does not suppress the differentiation and maturation process of IgE-producing cells.
Acute inflammation is a protective immune response triggered by trauma, pathogens, toxins, etc., which 
is initiated within minutes of recognition of “danger” signals by activation of the innate immune system. 
In contrast, resolution of inflammation is a dynamic and active process that regulates many cellular inter-
actions in affected tissues to restore homeostasis (9). Studies suggest that failure to reestablish homeostasis 
either by prolonged inflammation or insufficient resolution could lead to chronic inflammatory conditions, 
Specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) promote the resolution of inflammation and exert 
beneficial effects in animal models of chronic inflammatory diseases, including asthma. Previously, 
we have shown that certain SPMs reduce IgE production in B cells from healthy individuals, 
which has a critical role in allergic asthma. Here, we investigated the effects of SPMs on B cell IgE 
production in asthma patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from asthma patients were 
treated with 17-HDHA or RvD1, and IgE levels were measured. RvD1 and 17-HDHA dampened IgE 
production in B cells from most asthma patients, whereas B cells from a subset of patients taking 
oral steroids were refractory to SPM treatment. Molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction 
between corticosteroids and SPMs were investigated by treating B cells from nonasthmatic donors 
with corticosteroids in vitro. Corticosteroids blocked the inhibitory effects of 17-HDHA and RvD1 
on B cell IgE production by abolishing the suppressive activity of these mediators on IgE class 
switching. Corticosteroids decreased the expression of transcriptional repressor Bcl-6 as well as its 
suppressive activity on epsilon germline transcription. We conclude that 17-HDHA and RvD1 can 
reduce IgE production in asthma patients not taking high doses of steroids but that corticosteroids 
interfere with the ability of B cells to respond to proresolving mediators.

such as asthma. Recently, endogenous, lipid-derived, specialized proresolving 
mediators (SPMs) were identified to be important in promoting resolution of 
inflammation (10, 11). Once synthesized and secreted, SPMs signal through 
GPCRs to mediate their effects. Thus far, 5 primary receptor-ligand pairs 
have been identified: RvD1 binds GPCR 32 (GPR32), RvE1 binds chemo-
kine receptor 23 (ChemR23) or leukotriene receptor B1 (BLT1), LXA4 binds 
lipoxin A4 receptor/formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2), and RvD2 binds 
G protein–coupled 18 (GPR18) (12, 13). These receptor-mediated actions of 
SPMs are cell type specific, and the exact mechanisms are not known.
Given the important role of IgE in the pathophysiology of asthma, our 
lab has previously shown that RvD1, and the RvD1 precursor 17-HDHA, 
inhibit human B cell IgE production from healthy individuals (14). This 
was mediated through enhanced expression of the transcriptional repres-
sor, Bcl-6, which in turn suppressed B cell class switch to IgE. In our cur-
rent study reported herein, we investigated whether 17-HDHA or RvD1 
could reduce IgE production in B cells from asthma patients. To test our 
hypothesis, we recruited asthma patients, most of whom were taking cor-
ticosteroids either in an inhaled or oral form, depending on the severity of the disease, and isolated B 
cells to test the effects of SPMs. We further explored the mechanism(s) by which SPMs affect IgE syn-
thesis and how corticosteroids might influence the effects of SPMs.
Results
17-HDHA and RvD1 reduce B cell IgE production from asthma patients. Our lab has previously shown that RvD1 
and the RvD1 precursor 17-HDHA directly regulate human B cell function and suppress stimulus-driven 
IgE production from healthy donors. Here, we investigated the effects of these SPMs on B cells from asthma 
patients (Table 1). First, we evaluated the effects of 17-HDHA and RvD1 on spontaneous IgE production 
from unstimulated blood-circulating B cells in asthma patients. B cells from half of our asthmatic donors 
spontaneously produced IgE, whereas B cells from healthy donors produced undetectable levels of IgE 
(Figure 1A). This confirmed the presence of blood-circulating IgE-secreting B cells in some of the asthma 
patients, which were not found in healthy individuals. We then tested whether 17-HDHA and RvD1 could 
block spontaneous B cell IgE production. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were treated with 
the SPMs daily for 6 days, and cell culture supernatants were collected to measure IgE levels. Both mediators 
strongly dampened spontaneous IgE production (Figure 1B). Next, we investigated whether 17-HDHA and 
RvD1 can affect stimulus-driven differentiation of B cells to IgE-secreting cells. 17-HDHA and RvD1 were 
added to PBMCs isolated from asthma patients, followed by stimulation with an IgE-inducing cocktail for 
6 days (14). IgE production in B cells from most patients was significantly reduced by 17-HDHA and RvD1 
(Figure 2A); however, B cells from 3 donors were refractory to treatment (Figure 2B). Because we wanted to 
test the effects of these SPMs on a broad range of patients with asthma, we did not specify criteria for recruit-
ing donors or exclude any disease subpopulations. Interestingly, those with B cells that did not respond to 
treatment with 17-HDHA or RvD1 had severe asthma with occasional asthma attacks and were taking OCS 
at the time of collection (Table 1). The responders were taking only inhaled steroids and there were no other 
factors that could potentially differentiate these two groups.
Corticosteroids block the inhibitory effects of  SPMs on B cell IgE production in vitro. It was unexpected that B 
cells from asthma patients taking OCS would be refractory to SPMs. Therefore, we investigated the direct 
in vitro effects of corticosteroids on the ability of SPMs to regulate B cell IgE production. PBMCs from 
asthma patients who were not taking OCS were treated with dexamethasone (10 nM) prior to treatment 
with 17-HDHA or RvD1. After 24 hours of incubation, the mediators were added to PBMCs, followed 
by stimulation with an IgE-inducing cocktail for 6 days. All of the asthma patients we tested responded 
to 17-HDHA and RvD1, and their B cell IgE production was significantly reduced (Figure 3A). However, 
consistent with the results from donors being treated with OCS, dexamethasone completely abolished the 
inhibitory effects of 17-HDHA and RvD1 on IgE production (Figure 3B).
Corticosteroids reduce the inhibitory effects of  SPMs on B cell class switching to IgE. We next tested the effect of 
corticosteroids on several different steps involved in B cell differentiation to IgE-secreting cells. Because cor-
ticosteroids might exhibit effects on B cells indirectly through effects on bystander cells, we performed the

remaining experiments on purified B cells from healthy 
donors rather than PBMCs. First, we assessed the effect 
of dexamethasone and SPMs on IgE secretion in puri-
fied B cells. 17-HDHA or RvD1 alone reduced IgE 
production substantially (Figure 4A). Interestingly, the 
inhibitory activities of SPMs on IgE production were 
blocked with dexamethasone pretreatment (Figure 4A), 
similar to what we observed in the mixed population of 
PBMCs (Figure 3B). We next investigated the effects of 
17-HDHA and RvD1 in combination with dexameth-
asone on IgE class switching, and as indicators, we 
measured ɛGLT and mature IgE mRNA levels. Purified 
B cells were stimulated with the IgE-inducing cocktail 
for 24 hours for ɛGLT, and for 72 hours for mature IgE 
(14), following treatment with SPMs and/or dexameth-
asone. 17-HDHA or RvD1 alone reduced both ɛGLT 
and mature IgE mRNA levels, whereas dexamethasone 
pretreatment diminished these effects (Figure 4, B and 
C). As immune suppressors, corticosteroids are known 
to dampen cell proliferation and to induce cell apopto-
sis in high concentrations (μM range) (15, 16). To determine whether the effects of corticosteroids on B 
cell response to SPMs could be mediated by changes in cell proliferation, a [3H]thymidine incorporation 
assay was performed. B cells pretreated with dexamethasone showed significantly suppressed proliferation 
as early as 24 hours after stimulation, and this was maximized at day 3 (Figure 4D). Another well-known 
effect of dexamethasone is to promote differentiation of many different types of cells, such as adipocytes. 
Therefore, we next investigated whether SPMs plus dexamethasone could affect B cell differentiation. One 
of the important signaling pathways involved in B cell differentiation is the activation of PPARγ by PPARγ 
ligands (17, 18). We measured PPARγ binding activity activated by PPARγ ligands produced by B cells 
using a PPAR response element–luciferase (PPRE-luciferase) reporter assay. 17-HDHA alone (without 
dexamethasone) did not affect the levels of PPARγ binding activity (Figure 4E). Interestingly, in B cells 
pretreated with dexamethasone, 17-HDHA 
enhanced PPARγ activity compared with dexa-
methasone alone (Figure 4E).
Corticosteroids 
diminish 
the 
ability 
of  
17-HDHA to enhance the binding activity of  Bcl-6 
on the ɛGLT promoter region, Iɛ. We previously 
reported that the inhibitory effects of SPMs 
on B cell IgE production were mediated by 
enhancing expression of the Bcl-6 transcrip-
tional repressor, which in turn suppressed class 
switching to IgE by binding to the promoter 
region of ɛGLT (Iɛ) (14). Here, we investigat-
ed the effects of corticosteroids on the expres-
sion and activity of Bcl-6 on Iɛ. First, CD19+ 
B cells were isolated from healthy donors and 
treated with dexamethasone with or without 
17-HDHA or RvD1, followed by stimulation

with an IgE-inducing cocktail, and Bcl-6 expression was determined by Western blot. In 
B cells without dexamethasone, 17-HDHA and RvD1 enhanced Bcl-6 expression in a con-
centration-dependent manner, but dexamethasone reduced Bcl-6 expression regardless of 
17-HDHA treatment in B cells from multiple donors (Figure 5, A and B). To further inves-
tigate whether changes in total Bcl-6 expression induced by dexamethasone affected Bcl-6 
binding affinity to Iɛ, we performed a ChIP assay. Dexamethasone dramatically reduced 
the amount of Bcl-6 bound to Iɛ compared with untreated B cells and also diminished the 
ability of 17-HDHA to enhance Bcl-6 binding to Iɛ (Figure 5, C and D), consistent with 
dexamethasone’s ability to increase ɛGLT and IgE transcription (Figure 4, B and C) and 
prevent SPMs from inhibiting IgE production (Figure 4A).
Inhibition of  5-lipoxygenase activity blocks anti-IgE effects of  17-HDHA and RvD1. 17-HDHA 
can be converted to D-series resolvins by the action of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) (19), which 
is expressed in B cells (20). In an attempt to investigate whether the activity of 17-HDHA is dependent on 
its conversion to RvD1 (or other D-series resolvins), we treated B cells or PBMCs with a 5-LOX inhibitor, 
zileuton. B cells were treated with zileuton and with 17-HDHA or RvD1 at day 0 and day 3 and cultured 
for 7 days when the cell culture supernatants were collected to measure IgE levels by ELISA. Surprisingly, 
zileuton suppressed the anti-IgE effects of both 17-HDHA and RvD1 (Figure 6). This was observed in both 
purified B cells and a mixed population of PBMCs and suggests that the primary method of action of both 
17-HDHA and RvD1 on B cells is to stimulate production of other 5-LOX–dependent mediators.
Discussion
Omega-3 fatty acids have been touted to be effective in inflammatory diseases, including asthma (21). 
Recently, it was discovered that omega-3–derived SPMs are key mediators that possess proresolving activ-
ities (22). Evidence supports the hypothesis that asthma represents, at least in part, a failure to resolve 
chronic inflammation, with an imbalance between proinflammatory and proresolving mediators (23–27). 
For example, severe asthma patients have lower levels of LxA4 in BAL fluid and in exhaled breath conden-
sate compared with patients with mild asthma (24, 25). Additionally, the expression of the SPM receptor 
ALX/FPR2 on neutrophils and eosinophils is reduced in severe asthma patients (25). Exogenous treatment 
with RvD1 or RvE1 ameliorated asthma symptoms in mouse models of allergic airway diseases by reduc-
ing production of inflammatory mediators and recruitment of inflammatory cells in the lung (28–30). In 
our study, we show that the DHA-derived mediators, 17-HDHA and RvD1, reduced spontaneous as well 
as stimulated IgE production in B cells from asthma patients with a broad spectrum of disease severity.
Unexpectedly and interestingly, there was a subset of asthma patients whose B cells were refractory 
to SPM treatment, which was not observed in healthy donors. These refractory asthma patients were tak-
ing OCS to treat asthma attacks at the time of blood donation, whereas responding asthma patients were 
taking only inhaled steroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are known to have localized activity in lung, with low 
absorption rate and rapid clearance, which minimizes systemic side effects, while OCS are used only for 
patients who have uncontrolled symptoms or in cases of asthma exacerbations. The estimated serum peak 
concentration of inhaled fluticasone, a commonly used inhaled steroid, is 40–100 times lower than OCS, 
such as methylprednisolone or prednisolone (31–33). Therefore, peripheral blood immune cells including 
B cells in patients taking oral steroids would be exposed to much higher concentrations of corticosteroids. 
Corticosteroids are by far the most effective treatments available to control the symptoms of allergic diseases 
such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and seasonal allergies (34). Their beneficial effects include suppressing the 
production of proinflammatory mediators and inducing apoptosis of eosinophils (35, 36). However, cortico-
steroids only manage the symptoms of asthma; they do not eliminate the underlying root cause of the dis-
ease. Moreover, there is evidence that corticosteroids can enhance B cell IgE production in vitro and in vivo 
Figure 3. Corticosteroids block the inhibitory effects of SPMs on B cell IgE production in vitro. 
PBMCs from asthma patients who were not taking oral steroids were left untreated (A) or pretreat-
ed with dexamethasone (10 nM) (B) for 24 hours. The next day, SPMs were added for 30 minutes, 
followed by stimulation with an IgE-inducing cocktail for 6 days, after which cell culture supernatant 
IgE levels were measured. Each symbol represents an individual donor and represents means of trip-
licates. Data were analyzed by repeated-measures 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post test, **P ≤ 0.01,

(37–41). One study reported that allergic asthma patients had 
higher serum allergen-specific IgE levels after receiving corti-
costeroid treatment, while half of patients on long-term cor-
ticosteroid treatment developed sensitization to new allergens 
(37). Some in vitro studies have shown that corticosteroids, at 
micromolar concentrations, promote human B cell IgE pro-
duction when added with IL-4 (40, 41). Here, we found that 
nanomolar amounts of dexamethasone, which are in the ther-
apeutic range (42), prevented anti-IgE activities of 17-HDHA 
and RvD1 on both PBMCs and purified B cells. This was, at 
least in part, through increased B cell class switching to IgE, 
based on εGLT and mature IgE transcript levels. B cell class 
switching to IgE is tightly regulated, and one of the key players 
is the transcriptional repressor Bcl-6 (43, 44). We previously 
reported that 17-HDHA and RvD1 inhibited human B cell IgE 
production by enhancing Bcl-6 expression, which in turn sup-
presses class switching to IgE by reducing STAT6 activity on Iε 
(14). Here, dexamethasone dampened basal expression of Bcl-
6 even in unstimulated B cells, which also led to reduced Bcl-6 
binding affinity to the Iε promoter. Bcl-6 regulates transcrip-
tion of many different genes related to cell proliferation and 
proinflammatory cytokines (45). Due to its broad activity, the 
effects of 17-HDHA and RvD1 or dexamethasone were stron-
ger on Bcl-6 binding activity specific to Iε, compared with total 
Bcl-6 protein expression. Even with dexamethasone pretreat-
ment, 17-HDHA and RvD1 did enhance Bcl-6 binding affinity 
to Iε, but this was not enough to suppress class switching, as 
seen in Figures 4 and 5. It is known that corticosteroids can upregulate CD40 expression on the surface of 
B cells, leading to enhanced production of IgE in humans (41). In addition, activation of CD40 by mouse 
CD40 ligands reduces Bcl-6 expression in B cells (46), thus providing a likely mechanism whereby dexa-
methasone neutralizes the protective effects of SPMs on Bcl-6 expression.

cell class switching to IgE. Purified CD19+ B cells from healthy donors

It is interesting to note that in this study dexamethasone exhibited two counteractive activities on IgE 
class switching: downregulation of Bcl-6, leading to increased εGLT (Figure 4B and Figure 5), and sup-
pression of proliferation (Figure 4D), which is a key step preceding class switch recombination in B cells. 
The end result of these counterbalancing signals is that dexamethasone itself has no effects on net IgE 
production (Figure 4A). On the other hand, dexamethasone changes the clearly defined anti-IgE activities 
of 17-HDHA and RvD1. Dexamethasone reduced the inhibitory effects of SPMs on εGLT transcription by 
dampening basal Bcl-6 expression and enhanced autologous PPARγ binding activity synergistically with 
SPMs (Figure 4E). PPARγ signaling is required for B cell differentiation to antibody-secreting cells, and 
exogenous treatment of B cells with PPARγ ligands enhanced antibody production. These complex interac-
tions could explain why total IgE secretion is enhanced with dexamethasone plus 17-HDHA but not dexa-
methasone alone. Moreover, this might explain the observation that stress could trigger allergic reactions 
(47). It is likely that endogenous corticosteroids secreted in response to stress interact with SPMs produced 
in the B cell microenvironment and, all together, promote IgE production.

In general, PPARγ ligands show antiinflammatory and anti-
proliferative activities. In this context, some studies reported the 
beneficial effects of exogenous treatment of PPARγ ligands in 
preclinical mouse models of asthma, with reduced serum lev-
els of Th2 cytokines that regulate B cell IgE production (48, 
49). However, our lab has previously shown direct effects of 
PPARγ ligands on human B cells by enhancing differentiation 
and promoting IgG antibody production (17). Here, we show 
that 17-HDHA in combination with dexamethasone promot-
ed autologous PPARγ ligand production, which is associated 
with increased IgE production. Therefore, our study suggests 
that PPARγ ligands might have different effects on different cell 
types and also provides insights on the physiological role of 
PPARγ ligands on B cell IgE production in asthma.
Another possible mechanism through which corticosteroids 
diminish the anti-IgE activities of SPMs on B cells is by regulat-
ing the expression of SPMs receptors. RvD1 is known to exert 
its activity through binding to ALX/FPR2 or GPR32 receptors. 
However, it is not known whether 17-HDHA binds directly to spe-
cific receptors or is converted to D-series resolvins, which signal 
through receptors. Therefore, it will be very important to investi-
gate whether corticosteroids could change B cell expression of different SPM receptors in the future.
Although 17-HDHA has antiinflammatory activity in several experimental systems, it is unclear wheth-
er 17-HDHA is directly active as an SPM or whether it must be converted to RvD1 or some other com-
pound. Because 17-HDHA can be converted to RvD1 by the actions of 5-LOX, we attempted to determine 
whether 17-HDHA has a direct effect as an immunomodulatory SPM or is converted to RvD1 in treated B 
cells. Unexpectedly, a 5-LOX inhibitor, zileuton, blocked the anti-IgE actions of both 17-HDHA and RvD1 
(Figure 6). We suggest that the most likely explanation is that the anti-IgE effects of 17-HDHA and RvD1 
are mediated, at least in part, by promoting the synthesis of other 5-LOX–dependent mediators, such as 
lipoxins or E-series resolvins, that act on B cells in an autocrine fashion. Previous reports have shown that 
macrophages and neutrophils can produce and respond to SPMs in an autocrine manner to regulate inflam-
matory responses (50, 51). We have previously reported that lipoxin A4 decreases IgM and IgG production 
from memory B cells (52), and both lipoxin B4 and resolvin E1 reduce allergic airway inflammation in a 
mouse model (28, 53), suggesting that these mediators could be involved in autocrine downregulation of 
IgE production in B cells. While this intriguing finding deserves more study, our results are strong evidence 
that, regardless of the mechanism of action of 17-HDHA, corticosteroids can disrupt the ability of B cells 
to respond to proresolving signals in asthma.
These results have important implications for the use of corticosteroids in chronic inflammatory diseas-
es, including asthma. While corticosteroids can be effective at suppressing chronic inflammation, systemic 
or OCS also have deleterious side effects, including weight gain, osteoporosis, and growth retardation in 
children (54). As novel asthma therapies are introduced, including CysLT inhibitors and biologics such as 
omalizumab and mepolizumab, they are positioned as steroid-sparing strategies (55, 56), but when they are 
ineffective or in the event of acute exacerbations, clinicians return to OCS as the mainstay of treatment (57). 
While OCS are undoubtedly effective at relieving symptoms and improving airway obstruction, it has been 
recognized that they may not alter the course of the underlying disease. And there is now a growing body 
of evidence that immunosuppressive treatments like corticosteroids also suppress resolution mechanisms

were treated with zileuton (10 μM) prior to 17-HDHA or RvD1 treatment, 
followed by stimulation with the IgE-inducing cocktail. Cell culture 
supernatants were collected at day 7, and IgE levels were measured. The 
experiment was done in one representative donor (mean ± SEM). Data

(58–60). For example, Vachier’s group has shown that polymorphonuclear cells from asthma patients taking 
long-term OCS treatment showed impaired 5-LOX activity, leading to a decrease production of the metab-
olites, including lipoxins (58). In addition, steroids had antiresolving effects in rat placental inflammatory 
responses via inhibiting LXA4 biosynthesis (59). Here, we show that corticosteroids interfere with the IgE 
inhibitory actions of RvD1 and the RvD1 precursor 17-HDHA on B cells. While this suggests that use of 
SPMs as therapy may need to be limited to patients not on OCS, it also implies that OCS interfere with 
endogenous resolution mechanisms and may prolong or worsen underlying disease, given that these media-
tors are present endogenously in asthma patients, albeit at reduced levels. This has profound implications for 
the ongoing use of OCS in chronic inflammatory diseases and highlights the need for effective alternatives 
that do not block endogenous resolution pathways.
In summary, we report the proresolving role of SPMs in regulating human B cell IgE production from 
asthma patients and their interaction with corticosteroids. Our results suggest that SPMs are important 
potential therapeutics for most patients with allergic asthma. Further, our results highlight that immuno-
suppressive therapies like OCS also suppress endogenous resolution pathways and suggest one method by 
which OCS may actually exacerbate allergic diseases.
Methods
Subjects. Subject characteristics are listed in Table 1. Seventeen asthma patients were recruited for study at 
the Mary Parkes Center for Asthma, Allergy and Pulmonary Care, and clinical severity of the disease was 
assessed according to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines. Because we wanted to test the 
effects of SPMs on a broad range of patients with asthma, there were no specified criteria for recruiting 
donors or excluding any disease subpopulations. All subjects with asthma were being treated with inhaled 
corticosteroids, with β2-agonists as needed. Two subjects were taking oral steroids at the time of blood 
sample collection, and one had their last OCS 3 weeks before blood collection.
Nonasthmatic donors were recruited for further mechanism(s) study, and none of them presented bron-
chial or respiratory disease.
Cell culture conditions and reagents. Human peripheral blood B cells were isolated as previously described 
(61). Where indicated, some experiments with cells from asthma patients were performed on PBMCs. 
Purified B cells or PBMCs were cultured in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO/Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% 
fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 × 10–5 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM HEPES, and 50 μg/
ml gentamicin. mCD40 ligand (CD154) was prepared using an insect membrane culture as previously 
described (62). The IgE-inducing cocktail was composed of mouse CD40 ligand (1:50 dilution), IL-4 (50 
ng/ml, R&D Systems), and CpG ODN2395 (0.5 μg/ml, Invivogen). Resolvin D1 (RvD1, 7S,8R,1-trihy-
droxy-4Z,9E,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid) and 17 (R)-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-
HDHA, 17R-hydroxy-4Z, 7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 15E, 19Z-docosahexaenoic acid) (Cayman Chemical Company) 
were suspended in ethanol and supplemented in cell culture as previously described (14). Cells were pre-
treated with either vehicle control or SPMs for 30 minutes and then were treated with an IgE-inducing 
cocktail or left unstimulated. Additional SPM treatments were added every 24 hours for the duration of 
the experiment in culture. When necessary, dexamethasone (10 nM) was added to cells for 24 hours prior 
to SPM treatment. The 5-LOX inhibitors, zileuton (Selleckchem) or MK-886 (Selleckchem), were added to 
cells 30 minutes prior to SPM treatment.
ELISA. Purified B cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) or PBMCs were cultured in triplicate in 96-well round-bottom 
plates for 6 days as previously described (14). Antibody levels in the supernatant were measured by ELISA 
as specified by the manufacturer (Bethyl Laboratories).
Cell proliferation assay. Purified CD19+ B cells were cultured in round-bottom plates (5 × 105 cells/ml) in 
triplicate. [3H]Thymidine (1 μCi/well) was added 48 hours prior to harvest. Incorporation was measured 
with a Topcount Luminometer (PerkinElmer).
PPRE-luciferase reporter assay. A PPRE-firefly luciferase reporter construct containing 3 copies of a 
PPRE (PPRE-firefly luciferase), an SV40 Renilla luciferase construct (Promega), and a PPARγ2 construct 
(63) were introduced into HEK293FT cells cultured in T25 flasks using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 
As a negative control, a construct containing constitutively expressed firefly and Renilla luciferase (psi-
CHECK-2, Promega) was used in place of the PPRE reporter and SV40 reporters. After 4 to 6 hours, 
reporter cells were washed, trypsinized, plated in 96-well plates, and treated with experimental superna-
tants or positive or negative controls (20–1,000 nM rosiglitazone or 0.1% DMSO vehicle). Experimental

supernatants were collected from human B cell cultures treated with or without dexamethasone for 24 
hours, followed by addition of SPMs, and stimulated with an IgE-inducing cocktail for 6 days. After a fur-
ther 12- to 15-hour overnight incubation, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using Dual-
Glo Luciferase Assay buffer (Promega) and read on a Varioskan Flash luminescent plate reader (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific). Light output is proportional to PPRE binding activity, which is an indirect readout of 
PPARγ ligands in the culture medium.
Real-time PCR. Purified B cells treated with SPMs, with or without dexamethasone pretreatment, were 
stimulated with an IgE-inducing cocktail for a certain amount of time (see legend for Figure 4). Total 
RNA was extracted with a Qiagen RNAeasy mini kit using 1 × 106 cells/sample. RNA from each sample 
was reverse transcribed with SuperScript III and random primers (Invitrogen). The cDNA was amplified 
in a real-time PCR reaction using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and quantified with Bio-Rad icy-
cler software. Amplification of HPRT was used to normalize and quantify the relative gene expression. 
The primers used were as follows: εGLT forward, 5′-CACATCCACAGGCACCAAAT-3′; εGLT reverse, 
5′-ATCACCGGCTCCGGGAAGTA-3′; mature IgE forward, 5′-ACCCTGGTCACCGTCTCCTCAG-3′; 
mature IgE reverse, 5′-CAGAGTCACGGAGGTGGCATT-3′; HPRT forward, 5′-ATGACCAGTCAA-
CAGGGGAC-3′; and HPRT reverse, 5′-TGCCTGACCAAGGAAAGCAA-3′.
Western blotting. Purified human B cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% 
sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM Tris, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). 
Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 8% SDS-
PAGE gels (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific) were loaded with 10 to 30 μg of protein and transferred 
to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Western blots were probed with rabbit anti-human Bcl-6 (D65C10, 
Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1,000) and rabbit anti-human β-tubulin (2146, Cell Signaling Technology). 
HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used to detect 
specific probed antibodies. Western blots were visualized by autoradiography after incubation with ECL 
(Perkin Elmer Life Sciences Inc.).
ChIP assay. Human PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were stimulated for 4 hours at a density of 
1 × 106 cells/ml with the IgE-inducing cocktail and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min-
utes at room temperature. A total of 2 × 107 cells per condition were used. Cross-linking was quenched 
by incubation with 0.125 M glycine for 5 minutes, and cells were washed with PBS twice, resuspended 
in 1 ml of ChIP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 1× proteinase inhibitors 
Complete EDTA-free), and incubated on ice for 5 minutes. The lysates were sonicated on ice to shear 
DNA using the Misonix Sonicator 3000 at its highest amplitude, with 2 periods of 30-second sonica-
tion and then another period of 20-second sonication. DNA fragments of 100–500 bp were obtained. 
10 μl of each sample was kept as input control, and the remainder of samples was diluted 5 times with 
dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1× protease 
inhibitor Complete EDTA-free) and precleared with 50 μl slurry of protein A-agarose beads (blocked by 
0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA in 1 mg/ml of BSA) for 3 hours on a rotating wheel at 4°C. Beads were 
pelleted in a benchtop centrifuge at 750 g for 1 minute at 4°C, precleared extract was transferred into a 
new tube, 2 μg of anti-Bcl6 (N-3, Santa Cruz biotechnology) or 1 μg rabbit IgG was added, and samples 
were incubated rotating overnight at 4°C. 100 μl of blocked protein A beads were added to the ChIP 
reactions and then incubated rotating for 2 hours at 4°C. Supernatants were removed and beads were 
washed sequentially in Paro buffer I, II, and III (as shown below) and then 2 times with 1× TE buffer 
at room temperature. Paro buffer I consists of 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-
HCl, pH 8.1, and 150 mM NaCl. Paro buffer II consists of 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 
20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 200 mM NaCl. Paro buffer III consists of 0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% 
deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. Washes were 1 ml each, and there were 7–10 
minutes of incubation in between Paro washes. Elution was performed twice with 100 μl of Elution 
buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3) and tap mixed every couple minutes. 6 μl of 5 mg/ml of proteinase 
K was added to the combined elutes and the input control samples and then incubated overnight at 
65°C. The next day, DNA was purified using Qiagen PCR purification kit and qPCR was performed 
using primers for Iε germline promoter region: forward, 5′-CTAGAAAGAGGCCTACACCTG-3′ and 
reverse, 5′-GCCAGACTGTTCTTATTCG-3′.
