Abstract  
 
This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review of greenhouse gas emissions 
for different food categories from life cycle assessment (LCA) studies, to enable streamline 
calculations that could inform dietary choice. The motivation for completing the paper was 
the inadequate synthesis of food greenhouse gas emissions available in the public domain. 
The paper reviewed 369 published studies that provided 1,718 global warming potential 
(GWP) values for 168 varieties of fresh produce. A meta-analysis of the LCA studies was 
completed for the following categories:  fresh vegetables (root vegetables, brassica, leaves 
and stems); fresh fruits, (pepo, hesperidium, true berries, pomes, aggregates fruits and 
drupes); staples (grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and rice); dairy (almond/coconut milk, soy milk, 
dairy milk, butter and cheese); non-ruminant livestock (chicken, fish, pork); and ruminant 
livestock (lamb and beef).  The meta-analysis indicates a clear greenhouse gas hierarchy 
emerging across the food categories, with grains, fruit and vegetables having the lowest 
impact and meat from ruminants having the highest impact. The meta-analysis presents the 
median, mean, standard deviation, upper and lower quartile, minimum and maximum results 
for each food category. The resultant data enables streamline calculations of the global 
warming potential of human diets, and is illustrated by a short case study of an Australian 
family’s weekly shop. The database is provided in the Appendix as a resource for 
practitioners. The paper concludes with recommendations for future LCA studies to focus 
upon with respect to content and approach.

Introduction 
The consumption of food contributes to a significant proportion of a person’s overall 
greenhouse gas impact (Dey et al., 2007), with agricultural production accounting for 19%–
29% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (Vermeulen et al., 2012). Consumers 
are also displaying ‘a moderately high level of concern’ for the sustainability with respect to 
food production (Grunert et al., 2014, p.187). Life cycle assessments (LCAs) of food

ingredients and products provide the primary means to understand a food’s environmental 
impact, discussed in this paper with specific respect to a food’s Global Warming Potential 
(GWP)1. While a substantial number of food LCA studies have been completed, comparing 
food impacts to enable decision making with confidence is difficult at present for four 
reasons.  
First, it is often cited that LCA results should not be compared (Desjardins et al., 2012; Foster 
et al., 2006; McAuliffe et al., 2016; Röös et al., 2013) due to variation in methodology 
choices, functional units, as well as temporal and regional differences2. Second, no single 
comprehensive review was identified that adequately covers the breadth of fresh foods 
available to consumers and caterers. As Helle et al. (2013, p.12643) state ‘data availability 
and quality remain primary obstacles in diet-level environmental impact assessment’, while 
Pulkkinen et al. (2015) calls for the creation of a database that communicates data quality, 
uncertainty and variability to reliably differentiate between the GWP of food types. Previous 
studies have compiled LCA data to compare different foods (e.g. Audsley et al., 2009; 
Berners-Lee et al., 2012; Bradbear and Friel, 2011; de Vries and de Boer, 2010; Foster et al., 
2006; Nijdam et al., 2012; Sonesson et al., 2010; Roy et al., 2009). While these are useful 
attempts, the identified studies are inadequate in the coverage of fresh foods available. 
Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) attempt to inform consumers of the 
environmental impacts (carbon, water and ecological footprint) of specific foods, however 
they also fall short in breadth of items covered at present.  The most comprehensive attempt 
at carbon footprint labelling was performed by Tesco (2012), however failed to label key 
categories such as fresh fish, pork, lamb or beef before finishing in 2012 due to the scale of 
the labelling scheme and a lack of participation from other retailers (Head et al., 2013).  
Third, studies that do compare results may often present singular figures. Peters et al. (2010) 
and Röös et al. (2011) argue that a range of impacts should be reported from LCA’s to better 
represent the variety of environmental impacts, as opposed to a singular figure. Finally, there 
is a lack of synthesised open access LCA data in the public domain available to consumers to 
inform decision-making.  
Therefore this paper presents a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of food LCA 
studies in the last 15 years to assess the GWP of fresh food. This paper aims to utilise existing 
GWP values from a variety of LCA studies to generate a database that enables the streamline 
accounting for individual meals, diets, catering organizations, or nations. The collation and 
characterisation of data on the GWP values for different food categories is the focus of this 
paper. The meta-analysis identifies areas where there is strong agreement in the GWP values, 
a short case study on the use of the GWP data to assess diets is provided in the discussion 
section, prior to recommendations being provided on how future food LCA studies could be 
undertaken to enable more direct comparisons. 
                                                     
 
1. GWP values (represented as kg CO2-eq/kg produce) was selected as an environmental indicator due to the 
global significance of climate change, and as a consistent metric reported in LCA studies. For example, 
Renouf and Fujita-Fimas (2013) identified that 92% of Australian food LCA’s reported Greenhouse gas 
emissions. The Life Cycle Impact Assessment guidance flagship project of UNEP/SETAC suggest that the 
sensitivity of LCA results should be explored to metrics other than GWP, such as fine particulate matter 
emissions, land and water use, and biodiversity loss (Frischknecht et al., 2016). Using one indicator in GWP 
only is a limitation of the paper, expanding to include additional indicators is an area for further research.  
2. These methodological differences are discussed later in the paper in section 4.1.

Method 
2.1 
Systematic review strategy 
The systematic review was completed following the PRISMA Statement protocol to minimize 
the risk of bias, and increase scientific validity (Moher et al., 2009). The systematic literature 
search for food LCA studies was completed in February 2015 across three types of literature: 
peer reviewed scholarly journal papers; conference proceedings; and, EPDs (see Fig. 1). 
Searches for peer reviewed journals were completed in Sciencedirect using the key words 
‘LCA + food + CO2’. Conferences proceedings were reviewed from the international 
conference ‘Life Cycle Assessment in the Agri-Food Sector’ from 2010-2014. The EPD 
search was completed in Google using the key words ‘environmental product declaration’, 
carbon footprint and carbon label.  
The initial studies reviewed identified additional studies for review by two mechanisms; first, 
scanning the document text and reference list for additional studies, and second, using the 
cited in function from Google scholar to identify relevant articles for review. Grey literature 
in the form of industry and government reports were identified through these two 
mechanisms. The inclusion of grey literature to avoid bias and ensure the systematic review is 
as thorough as possible is viewed as best practice (Blackhall, 2007). A limited number of 
targeted food searches were completed to identify foods that were absent. This was completed 
for almonds, cashews, peanuts, kangaroo, goat, turkey, ostrich, emu, rabbit, and quinoa.  
 Figure 1 Systematic literature review process 
Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they disclosed the LCA results in terms of CO2-
eq/mass unit for raw produce, and disclosed the system boundary, functional unit and location 
of production. Studies were excluded if results were only presented in alternative functional 
units such as eco-points, percentages, kg CO2-eq/ha., live weight gain/year or kg CO2-
eq/protein. Studies were also excluded if they included cooking, air-freight or canning without 
disclosing the percentage that these activities accounted for as they significantly alter the 
results. For example fruit and vegetables studies that cited international airfreight added 9.5 to 
10 kg CO2-eq/kg to Milà i Canals et al.’s (2008) study of vegetables and 11 to 12.5 kg CO2-
eq/kg from Hofers (2009). Avoiding air freighted produce has been raised in previous studies 
and is not a focus of the paper (e.g Jungbluth et al., 2000).

2.2 
Synthesizing results for comparison 
GWP values from the reviewed studies were collated into a database under the following 
broad category headings: fresh fruits, vegetables and staples; dairy; non-ruminant livestock 
and ruminant livestock. In addition, data relating to the LCA method were collated including: 
• 
Year of study 
• 
Geographic location of study. 
• 
Original system boundary 
• 
LCA approach utilised (process based or economic input-output or hybrid LCA) 
• 
Unique descriptors (e.g. species, feed type, farming methods etc.)  
Each GWP value recorded was converted into a common functional unit and system 
boundary in kg CO2-eq /kg bone free meat (BFM) or produce, at the regional distribution 
centre (RDC). 
2.2.1 
Conversion of functional units to bone free meat 
In LCA, the functional unit is the unit by which all environmental results are reported. The 
functional unit is typically based on the primary function that a product or service provides. 
Defining the functional unit for food can be challenging and as such, the functional units can 
vary between food studies. Functional units reviewed in this study for meat products 
included:  
• 
Head of animals per year 
• 
Kilogram Live Weight (LW) 
• 
Kilogram Hot Standard Carcass Weight (HSCW) 
• 
Kilogram Carcass Weight (CW) 
• 
Kilogram edible meat from carcass or kg bone free meat (BFM) 
• 
Kilogram of prime retail cut or chicken breast 
To enable comparison, the GWP values for meat studies were converted to a common 
functional unit in kg CO2-eq /kg BFM. A significant variation in results can occur depending 
on the functional unit, particularly for meats. For example, only 43% of a live weight (LW) 
pig is edible meat (Sonesson et al., 2010). Table 1 illustrates the conversion ratios identified 
in the literature that were utilised to enable the conversions.

Accounting for variation in system boundaries 
The system boundary used in the food LCA studies also varied, such as:

•

•

To enable comparison, the GWP values were converted to the system boundary of the 
Regional Distribution Centre. The system boundaries were recorded in the database. The 
packaging and transport median figures from Table 2 were added to studies where the system 
boundary finished at the farm gate.

The LCA studies typically analysed farm inputs from chemicals and fertilisers; fuel and 
energy inputs from irrigation and machinery for cultivation, harvesting and processing; and 
transport and refrigeration to the regional distribution centre.  Outputs included emissions 
released from fertilised soils, plants and animals in fields (see Fig. 2). Nurseries for 
horticulture, while important are presented outside the simplified system boundary, as Cerutti 
et al.’s (2014) review stated only 3/19 studies included this stage. Most food LCA’s also 
exclude infrastructure and capital goods (Mungkung and Gheewala, 2007; Roma et al., 2015). 
Infrastructure and capital goods are also excluded within PAS 2050 (BSI, 2011) and Gabi’s 
LCA software model for Agriculture (Deimling and Rehl, 2016), and presented outside the 
simplified system boundary. 
Human consumption, including how consumers travel to shops, store food, cook, dispose of 
food and packaging, and excrete were outside the scope of the study, and were excluded from 
entries entered into the database3.  Fruits and vegetables that were grown in a greenhouse 
were analysed in a separate greenhouse category.  
                                                     
 
3 The authors acknowledge that consumption, and end-of-life management of food and packaging will alter results. 
Of particular note is the 30% of purchased food that is not eaten, with a potential causal relationship to packaging 
design (see for example Wikström et al. 2014). This remains outside the scope of the study.

Meta-analysis of data  
The database (see Appendix) was analysed across each food category in Microsoft Excel to 
calculate statistics, including: 
• 
Number of studies 
• 
Number of GWP scenarios (one study may present multiple comparative results, all 
results were entered) 
• 
Median, mean, standard deviation, upper and lower quartiles, minimum and 
maximum  
Key statistics were represented schematically using box-whisker plots to assist in 
understanding the spread and interpretation of the data points. Further analysis was completed 
on food categories that had multiple data entries to check for correlation between GWP values 
and geographic locations, farming methods or species.

Results of systematic literature review on Food GWP values  
3.1 
Located literature 
The meta-analysis cites 369 published LCA studies that provided 1,718 GWP values for fresh 
produce from the year 2000 to 2015. 192 journal papers, 80 conference papers, 64 reports (for 
industry and government), 29 web-based EPDs, and four theses were utilised in total. The 
majority of GWP values (58%) were from the last five years (see Fig. 3). It is of note that 
most studies produced multiple GWP values, for example the studies may compare different 
food types, growing regions, methodological choices or production methods.

Figure 3 Summary of publication dates for food GWP values  
Searching via Sciencedirect produced 3,355 results, the first 1,000 titles were scanned for 
relevance, of which 113 LCA studies were downloaded for review, 47 being directly used for 
analysis. Eight studies were used to mine citations.  The initial 47 studies identified an 
additional 64 references to review, which in turn provided further references.  
Conference papers from the proceeding from the ‘Life Cycle Assessment in the Agri-Food 
Sector’ conferences in 2014 (n = 33), 2012 (n = 20), and 2010 (n = 13) were reviewed. Ruini 
et al.’s (2014) conference paper ‘LCA applied to sustainable diets’ and accompanying 
database was significant in identifying a substantial number of conference and journal articles 
for review.  
EPD studies (n = 29) were primarily identified through the ‘international EPD system’ 
webpage (EPD international, 2015) that provided 21 studies. Industry reports (grey literature, 
n = 64) were identified through in text citations in journal and conferences papers.  
The identified literature was predominately European centric (see Fig. 4 and Table 3), with 
the British Isles (n = 245), and Europe (n = 930) accounting for 68% of the utilised GWP 
values (n = 1,175), followed by North America (n = 167) and Oceania (n = 143). Asia (n = 
77), South America (74) and Africa (n = 23) were less represented. Within Europe, Spain (n = 
187) France (n = 173), Sweden (n = 153) and the Netherlands (n = 139) were dominant.

3.2 
Overview of results between food categories 
The summary of results for the GWP values recorded are presented in Fig. 5 and Table 4, 
they present a large variation in results between food categories. At the broadest level the 
lowest median GWP values were for field-grown vegetables (0.37 kg CO2-eq/kg), field-grown 
fruit (0.42 kg CO2-eq/kg), cereals (except rice) and pulses (0.50-0.51 kg CO2-eq/kg). Slightly 
higher values for tree nuts were found (1.20 kg CO2-eq/kg).  Rice had the highest impact of the 
plant based field grown crops (2.55 kg CO2-eq/kg), slightly higher than fruit and vegetables 
from heated greenhouses (2.13 kg CO2-eq/kg).  
Non-Ruminant livestock had medium GWP values in fish (3.49 kg kg CO2-eq/kg BFM), 
chicken (3.65 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM) and pork (5.77 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM).  Dairy products 
(cheese) and butter also shared a medium GWP values. 
Ruminant livestock in lamb (25.58 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM) and beef (26.61 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM) 
had the highest median GWP values.

Fresh Fruit, Vegetables and Staples  
The meta-analysis for the fruit and vegetable category is drawn from 122 LCA studies that 
generated 633 GWP values. Typical processes for the fresh vegetable category include farm 
inputs from chemicals and fertilisers, fuel and energy inputs from irrigation and machinery 
for cultivation, harvesting and processing, and transport and refrigeration to the regional 
distribution centre.  Outputs included nitrogen released from fertilised soils and emissions 
released from plants and fields. Maraseni et al. (2010) for example identified on-farm 
emissions related on average to: energy used for irrigation (54%), Nitrogen emissions from 
soils after N-fertiliser (17%), energy use for post-harvest storage (11%), fertiliser input (10%) 
and machinery and fuel use (8%).  The size of the farm (Milà i Canals et al., 2008), species 
requirement for fertiliser use (i.e. beans) or processing (i.e. asparagus) assist to explain the 
variations between and within the fruit and vegetable category.  
The analysis attempts to identify the values for individual foods (Table 5) as well as trends 
across the data. The fresh fruits and vegetables results were analysed further in four broad 
categories: vegetables, fruits, staples and greenhouse fruit and vegetables. These four 
categories were broken down further into botanical classifications in an attempt to identify 
key trends within the data, presented below in Table 6 and Fig. 6.

and full references.  
a) The number of LCA studies and GWP values column from table 5 does not correlate to tables 6, 7 and 8, as one LCA study may provide 
multiple GWP values for multiple food categories, or provide a singular GWP value for multiple food types e.g. ‘apples and pears’ (counted 
as separate GWP values under apples, and pears in table 5, and once only as Pome in table 6). 
b) The ‘average from all heated greenhouse’ includes LCA values for heating generated by natural gas, oil, LPG, coal, electricity, and CHP, 
as well as 14 GWP values that came from studies with an unspecified heating source.  
c) Fruit and vegetables grown in different greenhouses in the above table is indicative only of reviewed studies, and not what may be grown 
in different green house types. 
 
The broad level GWP values within the fruits and vegetables see root vegetables with the 
lowest median value in 0.18 kg CO2-eq/kg, field-grown vegetables (0.37 kg CO2-eq/kg), field-
grown fruit (0.42 kg CO2-eq/kg), cereals (except rice) (0.50 kg CO2-eq/kg) and pulses (0.51 kg 
CO2-eq/kg). Slightly higher values were found for tree nuts (1.20 kg CO2-eq/kg) and seeds 
(1.41 kg CO2-eq/kg).  Rice had the highest impact of the plant based filed grown crops (2.55 kg 
CO2-eq/kg). The meta-analysis presents further granularity within the results with minor 
variations between the botanical classifications, however the majority fall within a narrow 
band of median figures from 0.29-0.60 kg CO2-eq/kg for pome, pepo, leaves, brassica, 
hesperidium, drupes, multiple fruits, grains, legumes, true berries, and aggregate fruits. This 
band is small in comparison to the variation in results in the livestock groups. Figures for 
musa (bananas) would likely join this grouping, however most studies noted production in 
South America, and shipping to a RDC in Europe (e.g. Iriarte et al., 2014; Lescot, 2012). The 
number of studies utilised for seeds were under represented and draw on one study only by 
Audsley et al. (2009).

Figure 6 Comparisons of synthesized GWP values across fruit, vegetables and staples classifications 
Greenhouse fruit and vegetables from heated greenhouses were notably higher than field-
grown equivalents, with a median of 2.13 kg CO2-eq/kg. Passive greenhouses with no 
auxillary heating had GWP figures comparable with the upper quartile of some field grown 
fruit and vegetables (1.10 kg CO2-eq/kg). The energy source used to heat the greenhouse, local 
climate and the thermal efficiency of the greenhouse has an impact on the GWP values (e.g. 
Page et al., 2012; Torrellas et al., 2012), as heating is responsible for the majority of 
greenhouse gas emissions in heated greenhouses (Boulard et al., 2011).  
3.4 
Non-ruminant livestock: fish, poultry and pork 
The non-ruminant livestock category analysed LCA studies including fish, poultry and pork. 
108 LCA studies were reviewed resulting in 446 GWP values.  Processes for non-ruminant 
livestock typically include breeding, feed production, fertiliser use, farm/broiler energy use 
including heating, as well as transport, processing and refrigeration. Farmed fish share largely 
these same processes, while wild fish processes largely relate to fuel consumption and 
emissions from refrigeration during the catch. The results of the non-ruminant livestock 
category are presented in Table 7 and Figure 7.

values and full references. 
     a) Pork world average includes one additional LCA value from Asia, two from South America and two unspecified world figures. 
 
Fish and chicken had similar median GWP values, 3.49 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM for all species of 
fish and 3.65 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM for chicken. The world average for pork was slightly higher 
with 5.77 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM. Within this data, a large variation in results were identified and 
further analysed by segregating individual species of fish, and the geographic location of pork 
production.  
The analysis of fish was further broken down between different species of fish (see figure 5). 
Within the results of specific species of fish, pilchards, pollock, carp, herring and mackerel 
presented low GWP values comparable with some plant based categories in tree-nuts and rice. 
Medium values were identified for salmon, cod and trout, while hake, anglerfish, swordfish 
and turbot had high GWP values. The higher values are for species caught offshore by 
trawling and long line fishing fleets that have significantly higher fuel consumption than 
coastal fishing fleets (Iribarren et al., 2010a; Iribarren et al., 2010b; Vázquez-Rowe et al., 
2012; Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2010). Shell-fish in prawn and shrimps displayed very high 
variations in GWP values, while lobster had the highest median GWP value in the category 
with a median value of 27.80 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM, which is in part due to the high cost of 
lobster and the economic allocation method used (Iribarren et al., 2010b).  
Chicken (3.65 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM) and eggs (3.46 kg CO2-eq/kg eggs) displayed similar 
median values. The type of protein used as feed (Pelletier et al., 2013) and farming methods

(Bengtsson and Seddon, 2013; Leinonen et al., 2012) have previously been identified as 
significant indicators of GWP values for chicken. 
With respect to pork, a notable variation in GWP values was evident when geography was 
considered, with European pork displaying a lower median value (5.50 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM) 
than the UK (6.00 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM), North America (6.11 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM), and 
Australia (7.65 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM). 
Limited GWP values were identified for duck, turkey, rabbit, and kangaroo. Therefore 
comparison with other food groups should be viewed tentatively, however the results are 
consistent with mid range figures for non-ruminant livestock.

Ruminant Livestock: Lamb and Beef 
The ruminant livestock category included lamb, beef and buffalo and was compiled from 64 
LCA studies resulting in 230 GWP values.  The farm processes included inputs associated 
with breeding, feed production, fertisliser use, farm energy and transport, as well as 
processing at the slaughter house; the main output was the enteric fermentation process from 
the livestock. Ruminant livestock are separated from non-ruminants by their multiple guts, 
whereby the ruminants produce methane as a result of the enteric fermentation process where 
bacteria converts feed to energy. This process is estimated to account for between 55-92% of 
the greenhouse profile of cattle (Vergé et al., 2008). The results for the ruminant livestock 
category are presented in Table 8 and Fig. 8. The geographic location of lamb and beef appear 
to have an influence on the resultant GWP values (see table 8), as identified by Ledgard et al. 
(2010). 
The median world average for lamb was 25.58 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM. Australian and New 
Zealand lamb appeared significantly lower with a median of 17.63 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM, where 
as EU lambs median GWP value was substantially higher at 32.70 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM.

Table 8 Ruminant GWP values (kg CO2-eq/kg BFM) 
 
The world average for beef was 26.61 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM. When geographic locations were 
compared for beef, South American beef had the highest median greenhouse gas profile with 
34.10 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM. Australian beef had the lowest median greenhouse gas profile with 
22.88 kg CO2-eq/kg BFM. The higher South American figure could be attributed to the 
inclusion of land-use change in the system boundary (Cederberg et al., 2011 p. 1773). Buffalo 
had the highest median greenhouse gas profile of all food analysed with a median of 60.43 kg 
CO2-eq/kg BFM, identified in one study only. In Australia and the UK, the median value for 
lamb was less than beef; this trend was reversed in the European studies.

categories. Within the dairy category, plant based milk substitutes in almond and soy-milk 
presented a lower median GWP value (0.42 and 0.75 kg CO2-eq/kg) than dairy milk (1.29 kg 
CO2-eq/kg).  Yoghurt had a similar value to milk, with cream (5.64 kg CO2-eq/kg), cheese 
(8.55 kg CO2-eq/kg) and butter (9.25 kg CO2-eq/kg) having higher median values (see Table 9 
and Fig. 9) due to the high concentration of milk used per kg in their production. As with 
ruminant livestock, the geographic location had an impact on the GWP value for dairy. This 
could be expected given dairy is a product of ruminant livestock, mirroring the location-based 
impacts of beef.

Discussion 
4.1 
Key Trends identified from the meta-analysis  
The meta-analysis confirms several existing trends previously identified in the LCA literature 
including the GWP hierarchy between broad food categories (e.g Head et al., 2013; Niggli et 
al., 2007)4; the hierarchy within plant based foods (Nemecek et al., 2012); and the importance 
of geographical location for ruminant livestock (e.g. Cederberg et al., 2011; Ledgard et al., 
2010). The meta-analysis is also suggestive of new findings including the broad variation in 
GWP values between species for the fish category; an unequal representation of food types in 
LCA studies that require further attention (discussed in section 5.1); and the dominance of 
Europe in LCA publications.  
4.2 
Attributing the variation between studies and the risk of bias 
To assess potential bias within studies, comparisons between methodological choices and 
publication type were completed for the beef and dairy categories only. Beef and dairy were 
selected as the category has a substantial number of LCA studies to enable comparison.  For 
the Beef category, results from European LCA studies that used economic-input output (EIO) 
modelling (top down studies) were compared against studies that used process-based 
modelling (bottom up studies). In theory, these two approaches should correlate.  The review 
of EIO studies from Lesschen et al. (2011) and others (n = 27 GWP values) when compared 
to process-based studies (n = 48 GWP values) illustrates that a strong correlation exists 
between methodological choices (see Figure 9). A very minor variation in median values of 
2.6% was identified with respect to beef production and LCA methodological choices (see 
Fig. 10 and Table 10).

Beef in Europe  
 
 
                                                     
 
4 The studies identified arable crops and vegetables to have lower greenhouse gas profiles than dairy, which is 
lower than poultry and pork, which is lower than beef.

Several authors have also published papers that compare methodologies between process 
based, EIO, and hybrid methodologies (e.g. Wiedemann and Yan, 2014), with results 
generally remaining within a similar quantum. 
With respect to publication types, the milk category was the only category where a substantial 
number of EPDs have been completed to enable comparison between publication types. LCA 
GWP values were therefore analysed between EPDs (n = 15), conference papers (n = 26), 
journal papers (n = 174) and grey literature in government and industry reports (n = 22). 
Minor variation between publication types and GWP values were evident (See Table 11) as 
results remained within a similar quantum of GWP values.

GWP values for Africa, Asia, Central and South America excluded from the above analysis as the high values skew the results for the 
conference category. If included the median for conference papers is 1.40 kg CO2-eq/L, and journal articles 1.30 kg CO2-eq/L 
 
The variations in GWP values could be attributed on a limited number of occasions to 
different methodology choices, or publication types. For example Ledgard et al. (2010) 
present a range of methodological choices and impact on GWP values (see Table 12). This 
could be open to exploitation if authors wish to select methodologies that could present their 
work with low GWP values that appear favourable.

Despite this, more often the regional differences and variations in processes at each stage of 
the lifecycle assist in explaining the differences in results.  In fact, many comparative studies 
show a diversity of GWP values from differing production processes, geographic locations or 
yearly yields. For example, there is Desjardins et al.’s study of beef production (2012), 
Leinonen et al.’s study for chicken (2012), Winther et al.’s study for fish (2009) and Maraseni 
et al.’s (2010) and Milà i Canals et al.’s (2008) study of vegetable production. Presenting 
multiple GWP values is consistent with Peters et al.’s (2010) position that a range of impacts 
should be reported from LCAs, as opposed to a singular figure. The authors’ position when 
reading the meta-analysis is that the variation in farming methods and conditions has a more 
significant impact on the presented GWP values than methodological choices or publication 
type.  
4.3 
Using the meta-analysis for streamline accounting to inform sustainable diets. 
The meta-analysis and accompanying database provides GWP values for a variety of food 
types that could be used to calculate the GWP of differing diets in a streamlined manner. For 
example, median figures from an alpha version of the database in this paper were utilised by 
Verghese et al. (2014) to estimate and compare the GWP values for a variety of weekly shops 
illustrated in Menzel and D’Alusio’s (2005) photographic text Hungry Planet. The study 
identified ‘hotspots’ for potential improvements in weekly diets. For example Fig. 11 shows 
that 54% of an Australian family’s food related GWP was due to meat, fish and egg purchases 
(Verghese et al., 2014).  
 
Figure 11 Summary of the GWP for the weekly diet of an Australian family (Verghese et al., 2014). 
The meta-analysis and accompanying database from this paper enable numerous alternate 
scenarios to be created that could reduce the identified ‘hotspot’ in the ‘weekly shop’. Three 
scenarios were remodelled to illustrate this point, in:  a) the original diet5, b) substituting 
meats with alternative meats in a ‘like for like’ manner, and c) creating an alternative plant 
and fish based diet. Diet c) calculated the protein from food purchased in other sections of 
Figure 11, and balanced the remaining protein from legumes, nuts and fish to meet the 
recommended daily intake (RDI) for protein from the National Health and Medical Research 
Council (2015), replacing all ingredients in Table 13A. 
                                                     
 
5 The meat, fish and dairy section only of the original diet were remodelled using median figures from Table 5 and 
Table 8. There was limited variation in results for the meat, fish and dairy between the alpha version tested by 
Verghese (2014) and final figures utilised and presented in Table 5.

* Not applicable, as an overconsumption of proteins exists in the diet of scenarios in Tables 13A and 13B. The necessary proteins could come 
from other type of food sources already computed in the elements of the baseline scenario (highlighted in grey above) and are different from 
meat, fish and eggs category in Fig.11. The recommended dietary intake for protein for the family of four was calculated to be 1365 grams 
per week. 40 g/day for a 9-13 year old boy, 45 g/day for a 14-18 year old women, 46 g/day for a 30-50 year old women and 64 grams per day 
for a 30-50 year old man (NHMRC, 2015). Protein figures are median values from the USDA National Nutrient Database (2015).

The results from the three scenarios show a large variation in the median GWP per week. 
Substituting ruminant meat (beef and lamb) for non-ruminant meat (kangaroo, duck and 
rabbit), and selecting an alternate fish species in pollock (Table 13B) produces an estimate 
30% reduction in GWP in relation to the median weekly shop in Fig 11. An alternate diet that 
attempts to match the recommended weekly protein intake via a plant and fish based diet 
(Table 13C) produces an estimate 52% reduction in GWP related to the median weekly shop 
shown in Fig 116. Calculating the diets utilising the lower (Q1) and upper (Q3) quartile values 
is view by the authors as a proxy measure to calculate data uncertainty, the results provided 
indicate that there is a significant differences between the three diets (A, B and C) that is far 
from overlapping, and reliably differentiates between the GWP of the three diets (as desired 
by Pulkkinen et al., 2015). 
The above streamlined results may be less valid than a detailed process based LCA, however 
this approach can be used to calculate different scenarios and what ifs, helping to better 
inform consumers of the choices that are available. The compiled database is the foundation 
for the development of streamlined tools to rapidly calculate the GWP of differing diets. The 
approach of compiling material CO2-eq inventories based on LCA data has been utilised to 
rapidly estimate GWP impacts for packaging (e.g. PIQET design tool), products (e.g. 
greenfly), and buildings (e.g. Bath Universities ICE database) (Hammond and Jones, 2008; 
Horne et al., 2009, p.155). As Verghese et al, argue ‘While streamlined LCA tools are 
compromises, they can be potentially useful and have their own unique role in furthering the 
use of LCA data in decision making’ (2010, p.108).  
5 
Recommendations for future LCA practice 
5.1 
Study under represented food groups 
The meta-analysis indicates that the representation of food categories by LCA studies is 
unequal with respect to particular foods. The literature review identified that limited studies 
were available for tree nuts in almonds and cashews, and for quinoa, duck, rabbit, turkey, and 
kangaroo. Better representation of such foods is important as they are positioned in grey 
literature and popular texts as alternate low GWP protein sources. The lack of published LCA 
data makes the GWP values on these foods harder to validate, and is critical if attempts are 
made to inform dietary choice for environmental purposes.  
5.2 
Methodological choices to assist comparison  
The use of common functional units in food LCAs would make it easier to compare reports, 
avoid misrepresentation and strengthen the validity of comparisons. As Schau and Fet (2008) 
argue, standardisation of system boundary descriptions and functional units is required.  
However, as illustrated in our review, different system boundaries and functional units are 
commonly used.  The consistency of reporting in environmental product declarations EPDs 
that follow PAS2050, GHG protocol or ISO 14067 standards, and the development of product 
category rules that attempt to make food LCA’s more consistent and therefore comparable is 
                                                     
 
6 It is acknowledged that the streamline calculations are for two indicators in protein and GWP only. Changes to 
diet should be made following nutritional guidelines that include a broader range of metrics. However, the brief 
calculations above indicate that the modelled diet of the Australian family has a protein intake higher than the 
recommended daily intake.

welcome7. For example the reports available on the ‘envirodec’ website following the 
International EPD system based on ISO 14025 and EN 15804 clearly disclose impacts at each 
stage of the lifecycle to enable comparison (e.g. EPD international, 2015; Stefano, 2013; 
Villman, 2012).  
These two limitations highlight ways that future food GWP comparisons could be 
strengthened. However, despite the concerns over methodological choices and the limitations 
of the meta-analysis, the hierarchy identified and median figures collated from a large body of 
LCA work are valid for use in streamline accounting to enable directional decisions to be 
made. The collation of data with percentile bands and disclosed standard deviation enables 
the inclusion of data uncertainty when assessing the greenhouse profiles for food-related 
diets, as requested by Hallström et al. (2015). The authors agree with Röös et al.’s position 
that ‘when the ranges [of GWP values] are far from overlapping, the exact numbers are less 
important’ (2011, p.329). The meta-analysis of LCAs communicates a clear message and 
presents generalizable findings that should not be dismissed because of methodological 
limitations. 
6 
Conclusion 
This paper completed a meta-analysis of data relating to the greenhouse gas emissions for 
different food categories. While we agree that individual results from LCA studies should not 
be directly compared with other individual results, the meta-analysis of a large body of LCA 
work that draws on different methodologies, geographies and farming provides a strong 
greenhouse gas hierarchy across the food categories. Grains, fruit and vegetables had the 
lowest impact, with meat from ruminants having the highest impact. This hierarchy is well 
supported by other comparative literature. The median results could be used with confidence 
to provide a streamlined estimate of the impact of ingredients for dietary choice or menu 
planning for individuals and catering companies with a desire to reduce their carbon footprint, 
primarily by selecting food from differing categories. This is illustrated by a short case study 
in section 4.3 of an Australian family’s weekly shop. The meta-analysis addresses the 
limitation of previous studies by covering a broader range of food types and GWP values. 
Variations in data within each category may be attributable to different LCA approaches, 
including functional units, methods, geographic location and processes included. The 
collation of data with percentile bands enables the inclusion of uncertainty when assessing the 
greenhouse profiles for food-related activities.  A key recommendation from the meta-
analysis for future LCA practice is to study the underrepresented food types identified in the 
results and appendix, ideally following protocols (e.g. PAS2050, GHG protocol or ISO 
14067) that assist future comparison.
