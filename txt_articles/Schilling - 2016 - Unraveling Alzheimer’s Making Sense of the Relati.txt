Abstract. Numerous studies have documented a strong association between diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The
nature of the relationship, however, has remained a puzzle, in part because of seemingly incongruent findings. For example,
some studies have concluded that insulin deficiency is primarily at fault, suggesting that intranasal insulin or inhibiting the
insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) could be beneficial. Other research has concluded that hyperinsulinemia is to blame, which
implies that intranasal insulin or the inhibition of IDE would exacerbate the disease. Such antithetical conclusions pose a
serious obstacle to making progress on treatments. However, careful integration of multiple strands of research, with attention
to the methods used in different studies, makes it possible to disentangle the research on AD. This integration suggests that
there is an important relationship between insulin, IDE, and AD that yields multiple pathways to AD depending on the where
deficiency or excess in the cycle occurs. I review evidence for each of these pathways here. The results suggest that avoiding
excess insulin, and supporting robust IDE levels, could be important ways of preventing and lessening the impact of AD. I
also describe what further tests need to be conducted to verify the arguments made in the paper, and their implications for
treating AD.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating, fatal
disease that affects an estimated 5.2 million Ameri-
cans, and 44 million people worldwide. It is a disease
that is often harder on the families and caregivers of
the patient than on the patient themselves. The direct
costs to the US of AD in 2014 were estimated to
total $214 billion [1]. Adding in the informal costs
(the costs of family members and friends providing

unpaid care to those with dementia) doubles those
figures. The bulk of the financial burden of AD is not
due to the cost of drugs or doctor’s visits; instead, the
vast majority (75–84%) of the expenses go to nurs-
ing home care, plus formal and informal home care
[2]. The drugs currently available for AD (primar-
ily cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine) offer
only incremental improvements in symptoms—they
do not stop the progression of the disease [3–6].
Analysts estimate that AD will cost $1.5 trillion per
year US by 2050 if a more effective treatment is not
developed [7].

M.A. Schilling / Unraveling Alzheimer’s Disease
AD has been a difficult puzzle to solve, in part
because of an abundance of seemingly incongruent
findings. For example, though many studies have
identified a significant association between type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and AD (see the review
provided in Table 1), these studies have often come
to different conclusions about the causal mechanism
and its implications for treatment. Some studies, for
example, have concluded that insulin deficiency is
primarily at fault, suggesting that intranasal insulin or
inhibiting the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) could
be beneficial [8–11]. Other research has concluded
that hyperinsulinemia is to blame, which implies that
intranasal insulin or the inhibition of IDE could exac-
erbate the disease [12–16]. Similarly, recent studies
have found a strong association between AD and
amylin, a peptide hormone co-secreted with insulin
[17–20]. Jackson et al. and Srodulski et al. found
that amylin, like the amyloid-� (A�) protein thought
to be central to the pathology of AD, forms amy-
loid plaques in the brain, leading them to conclude
that amylin might be another amyloid with a causal
role in dementia. Oskarsson et al. similarly found
that amylin and A� were colocalized in plaques in
the brain, leading them to draw similar conclusions.
However, two other recent studies came to an oppo-
site conclusion: they obtained results suggesting that
amylin provides a neuroprotective effect that reduces
the symptoms of AD [21, 22].
Despite these seemingly incongruent results, care-
ful integration of multiple strands of research (with
attention to the methods used in different studies)
makes it possible to disentangle the research on AD.
Such an integration points to the likelihood of a rela-
tionship between insulin, IDE, and AD that yields
multiple pathways to the disease depending on the
where deficiency or excess in the cycle occurs.
I posit that the weight of the evidence suggests that
under normal circumstances, insulin upregulates the
expression of IDE, which subsequently breaks insulin
down [23, 24]. IDE, however, also plays important
roles in breaking down A� and other amyloidogenic
peptides. This system can malfunction and lead to AD
in at least four different ways as outlined below (see
Fig. 1) Evidence for each of these will be reviewed
in turn in the sections that follow:
1) An individual with severe insulin deficiency
(e.g., undertreated type 1 diabetes mellitus,
T1DM) may have inadequate IDE activity,
resulting in the accumulation of A� (and other
protein aggregates) in the brain [23, 25, 26].
Malfunction 1: Insulin deficiency
Insulin and amylin secretion
Upregulation of production or activity of IDE 
(and potentially other proteases)
Break down or binding of insulin, amylin, 
amyloid-β , 
and other amyloidogenic peptides
Malfunction 4: Excess production 
or synergistic interaction of 
amyloid peptides
Malfunction 3: Excess insulin or 
amylin results in competitive 
inhibition of amyloid breakdown
Malfunction 2: Diminished 
protease production or activity
Fig. 1. The insulin-protease-amyloid degradation pathway and its
potential malfunctions.
2) An individual with diminished IDE (or similar
protease) production may end up with accumu-
lation of A� and amylin plaques in the brain
[27–32].
3) If an individual has exceptionally high levels of
insulin (and amylin) in the body (e.g., due to
early stages of T2DM), the insulin and amylin
may competitively inhibit the breakdown of
A�, resulting in AD [30, 33–35].
4) An individual may produce more than a typ-
ical level of an amyloidogenic peptide, or
experience synergistic interactions between
amyloidogenic peptides, leading to deposition
that outpaces clearing by IDE and similar pro-
teases [17–19, 36–42].
INSULIN, INSULIN DEGRADING
ENZYME, AND ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
The potential roles of insulin and insulin degrad-
ing enzyme in AD and other dementias came under
scrutiny because of the strong association between
T2DM and AD. I thus begin here by briefly reviewing
the research on the relationship between T2DM and
AD, and I will then review the evidence (summaries
are provided in Table 1) for the pathway proposed in
Fig. 1 and its possible malfunctions.
Type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease
There is an abundance of studies suggesting that
T2DM has a positive association with AD. Some
of the most well known research in this area was
based on a large population study in Rotterdam [43,
44]. The longitudinal results from this study sug-
gested that diabetes increased the risk of dementia
by 1.9 fold, and that diabetic patients treated with
insulin were at even greater risk (4.3 fold). Another
longitudinal cohort study from the same time frame

significantly less IDE. “IDE upregulation requires
insulin-mediated Akt activation (Zhao et al., 2004a).
Therefore, insulin deficiency and a decreased
signaling via the PI3K pathway may contribute to
decreased IDE expression and thus contribute to
increased A� protein levels as a result of a reduced
degradation.” (pg. 428)

decreased expression or enzymatic activity of IDE, the
balance is shifted from degradation to deposition. In the case
of Type 2 diabetes, both insulin and amylin secretion are
increased due to peripheral insulin resistance. Because IDE
has approximately 4-fold greater affinity for insulin than for

dysfunction may underlie both AD and T2DM.
Leissring et al.,

In vivo, mice
Upregulation of either neprilysin or IDE (via genetic
modification) lessened the mortality of APP mice, and
increased A� degradation. Furthermore, the proteases acted
upon the soluble, monomeric A� species prior to over
deposition. The authors note that “the vast majority of
A�-degrading activity in these brain membrane samples is
attributable to IDE” IDE decreased both soluble and insoluble
A�, and “ . . . relatively small changes in the activity of IDE
and other A�-degrading proteases can dramatically impact
steady-state cerebral A� levels, suggesting that modest
increases in proteolytic clearance of A� in humans might be
sufficient to effect significant changes in the overall economy
of brain A�” Also, “chronic neuronal overexpression of IDE
or NEP beginning postnatally did not itself have obvious
deleterious consequences.”

found that T2DM was associated with an increased
risk for all dementias (1.66), and AD in particular
(2.27 fold for men, 1.37 fold for women) [45]. Sev-
eral other longitudinal cohort studies followed, with
nearly all concluding that T2DM increased the risk
of AD between 1.3 fold and 1.8 fold [46–49].
When cognitive testing is used to assess AD, there
is a risk that other types of dementias (notably vas-
cular dementia) will be labeled AD. A diagnosis of
AD may often be the result of multiple pathologies
[50]. Using autopsies, Schneider et al., for example,
found that of 179 probable AD cases, almost half
exhibited mixed pathologies—most commonly vas-
cular dementia as a result of cerebral infarctions or
neocortical Lewy bodies [51]. Notably, many studies
have also implicated T2DM in an increased risk of
vascular dementia [46, 52, 53], and, as I will explain
later, we have reason to suspect that T2DM could also
increase the risk of Lewy bodies.
As noted previously, there is considerable dis-
agreement about the mechanism by which T2DM
increases the risk of AD. One line of research posits
that it is the excess of insulin or glucose from T2DM
that leads to AD. Several studies have found that
people with AD have significantly higher levels of
insulin and glucose than healthy controls [13, 15, 54].
In a large sample longitudinal study of elderly sub-
jects, Luchsinger et al. conclude that 39% of AD in
their sample was attributable to hyperinsulinemia or
diabetes [55]. This is also consistent with earlier find-
ings of Ott et al. that diabetics that were treated with
insulin had far greater risk of AD [43, 44].
Another line of research, however, suggests that it
is insulin deficiency (either by the relative deficiency
that results from insulin resistance in early stages of
T2DM, or absolute deficiency that occurs when beta
cell dysfunction occurs in full-blown T2DM) that
causes AD by impairing insulin’s ability to perform
its roles in the brain [8, 56–61]. Insulin and its sig-
naling pathways have been found to affect learning
and memory [62, 63]. For example, some research
has found that administering insulin growth factors
in rats and mice enhances memory retention [63,
64], and depleting it impairs learning [65]. How-
ever, the mechanisms of insulin’s roles in the brain
remain poorly understood [66]. The potential roles
of insulin deficiency in AD has led some researchers
to conclude that administration of intranasal insulin,
or insulin sensitizers, would attenuate neurologi-
cal deficits. For example, in several studies, Reger
et al. found that moderate doses of intranasal insulin
improved some memory symptoms in older adults
 970

with AD or mild cognitive impairment [57–59].
However, it is important to note first that patients with
diabetes were excluded from the study, and second
that the results were nonmonotonic in the dosages of
insulin. That is, at higher levels, insulin administra-
tion impaired performance.
If insulin deficiency is one of the main culprits in
AD, then we would expect a very strong relationship
between undertreated T1DM (whereby an individual
does not produce insulin or amylin at all) and AD.
However, T1DM is much rarer than T2DM, and in
the past it often resulted in much earlier mortality.
Furthermore, survival of T1DM requires individuals
to be treated with insulin, confounding our ability
to analyze its relationship with AD. In a few stud-
ies, T1DM was induced in mice via administration of
streptozotocin, and these mice exhibited AD (or AD-
like) pathology [11, 24, 67, 68]1. For example, in
the study by Wang et al., inducing T1DM in mice via
administration of streptozotocin resulted in increased
A� generation, neuritic plaque formation, and spatial
memory deficits in mice engineered to exhibit AD
[11]. Similarly, a study by Clodfelder-Miller et al.
found that within three days of insulin depletion by
streptozotocin, mice exhibited a five-fold increase in
tauphosphorylation[68].Thereisalsosomeevidence
to suggest that having a severe insulin deficiency, as
in T1DM, could result in inadequate upregulation of
proteases that break down A� [71]. This leads, then,
to the first malfunction pathway proposed above.
MALFUNCTION 1. SEVERE INSULIN
DEFICIENCY MAY LEAD TO
INADEQUATE PROTEASE PRODUCTION
OR ACTIVITY
There is a paucity of information about what stim-
ulates IDE and other amyloid proteases, however,
the studies that do exist suggest that insulin is a pri-
mary regulator of IDE [23, 24, 26]. For example, in
one study, Zhao et al. conclude that IDE upregula-
tion requires insulin-mediated Akt (also known as
protein kinase B) activation [23], and mice induced
to have T1DM (and thus do not produce insulin)
expressed significantly less IDE [24]. Rezende et al.
also found that when insulin secretion levels were
dramatically reduced in mice through protein secre-
1It should be noted that there is disagreement about the valid-
ity of a Type 1 diabetes model based on the administration of
streptozotocin. Some studies have suggested that streptozotocin is
neurotoxic per se [69] while others have found that streptozotocin
is not directly neurotoxic [70].
tion, there was a concomitant dramatic decrease in
IDE expression in the liver [72]. This suggests that
a severe insulin deficiency could possibly be accom-
panied by an IDE deficiency that could lead to or
exacerbate AD. However, because severe insulin defi-
ciency is typically fatal if untreated, this malfunction
pathway is probably the least likely to be observed in
situ. Furthermore, there are other proteases known to
actuponA�(e.g.,cathepsinD,endothelin-converting
enzyme, neprilysin [73–77]) that may not be as reliant
upon insulin, and we know relatively little about how
these proteases are stimulated, which ones act on A�
in vivo, and how they may compensate for each other.
This area thus requires much further research.
MALFUNCTION 2. DIMINISHED
PROTEASE PRODUCTION OR ACTIVITY
RESULTS IN AMYLOID ACCUMULATION
IDE is one of the most widely studied proteases in
studies of the relationship between insulin and A�.
It is a ubiquitously expressed zinc metalloprotease
that breaks down or irreversibly binds insulin [27,
33, 36, 78, 79], amylin [36], A� [27–31, 33, 80–86],
and other amyloidogenic peptides [34, 36], includ-
ing alpha synuclein [87, 88], which is implicated
in Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia.
An individual with diminished IDE production (for
example, due to the excess of an IDE inhibitor such as
nitric oxide [89], or an inadequacy of zinc) might thus
end up with accumulation of A�, amylin plaques, and
alpha synuclein in the brain.
There are numerous studies showing that dimin-
ished IDE can result in accumulation of A� and
memory deficits [27, 90, 91]. For example, Farris
et al. found that IDE knockout mice had a greater
than 50% decrease in A� degradation in both brain
membrane fractions and primary neuronal cultures.
[27] The mice exhibited an increase in cerebral accu-
mulation of endogenous A� (consistent with AD),
hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance. Madani
et al. found that neprilysin knockout mice had
increased A� deposition [91], and Miller et al. found
that IDE knockout mice had significantly increased
levels of A� in the brain [92]. Vingtdeux et al.
found that CALHM1 potentiates IDE activity, and
CALHM1 knockout mice exhibited roughly a 50%
increase in endogenous A� concentrations in the
whole brain and primary neurons [85].
There is also research suggesting that deficiency
in IDE might lead to an accumulation of insulin
 M.A. Schilling / Unraveling Alzheimer’s Disease
971
in the brain (hyperinsulinemia), leading to insulin
resistance and glucose intolerance [27, 32]. Though
the possibility of IDE regulating insulin in the brain
remains to be directly tested, this possibility suggests
that one of the reasons that AD and T2DM are closely
associated might be because they can be caused by
the same mechanism.
Diminished IDE production may also account for
at least part of the association between the ApoE4
allele and AD. ApoE4 is a well-established risk factor
for AD; most estimates suggest that roughly 20–25%
of the population has the ApoE4 allele, yet roughly
50% of the AD population has the ApoE4 allele [21,
93, 94]. Furthermore, in their longitudinal study of
2,574 Japanese-American men (and 216 autopsies),
Peila et al. found that the combination of diabetes
and having one or more copies of the ApoE4 allele
resulted in a dramatically higher risk of AD—5.5
fold—than either risk alone [46]. Having a single
copy of the allele is thought to triple the risk for late-
onset AD; having two copies of the allele is thought
to increase the risk of AD 12 fold [94]. Importantly,
Cook et al. found that AD patients with the ApoE4
allele had a 50% reduction in expression of IDE
compared to AD patients without the ApoE4 allele,
suggesting that the ApoE4 allele may play a role in
IDE deficiency leading to AD [95]. The mechanisms
that underlie ApoE4’s relationship to AD remain to
be more fully explored, however.
Qiu et al.’s study, and a review by Qiu and Folstein,
suggest that IDE is likely to be an important protease
involved in A� degradation [30, 35]. Furthermore,
since the IDE gene plays a significant role also in
diabetes, this would help to explain the strong rela-
tionship between the two pathologies. However, it is
important to note that are other proteases that appear
to play roles in breaking down or binding A� such
as neprilysin, endothelin-converting enzyme, cathep-
sin B, or cathepsin D [73, 83, 96]. The role of these
proteases in A� degradation and AD pathology have
thus far received far less attention and warrant further
study.
MALFUNCTION 3. EXCESS INSULIN OR
AMYLIN COMPETITIVELY INHIBITS
BREAKDOWN OF A�
Though IDE can break down a range of amyloido-
genic peptides [34], it has a preferential affinity for
insulin [33, 36]. This suggests the possibility that,
consistent with Qiu et al.’s hypothesis, one of the
causal mechanisms leading to sporadic AD may be
the competitive inhibition of A� by insulin or amylin
[30]. Numerous studies have shown that insulin com-
pletely competitively inhibits the breakdown of both
A� [30, 33, 35] and amylin [36]. Furthermore, though
insulin upregulates the expression of IDE, it has been
shown that its ability to increase IDE diminishes at
high levels [23]. This suggests that in the hyper-
insulinemia of early T2DM (or obesity) [97, 98],
insulin levels could outstrip IDE’s ability to break
it down. If IDE preferentially targets insulin and
insulin levels are outpacing IDE production, IDE’s
ability to breakdown other amyloidogenic proteins
will be markedly reduced. As eloquently stated in
Bennett et al., “Normally, a balance exists between
deposition and degradation of the amyloidogenic
peptide. When the levels of the peptide exceed the
capacity to degrade them, either by increased expres-
sion of the peptide, or decreased expression of the
enzymatic activity of IDE, the balance is shifted
from degradation to deposition.” [36] The chronic
hyperinsulinemia of early T2DM and its potential to
competitively inhibit the breakdown of A� thus likely
explains a large portion of the association between
T2DM and AD.
This competitive inhibition of degradation among
different IDE substrates brings us to the recent amylin
studies. In 2013, Jackson et al. found patients with
AD had large amylin plaque deposits and mixed
amylin and A� deposits in their brains [17]. They
concluded that amylin may play a causal role in AD.
Then in 2014, Srodulski et al. found that rats that
were genetically modified to express human amylin
accumulated amylin oligomers in their brains, and
exhibited neurological deficits [18]. Oskarsson et al.
also found that amylin and A� were colocalized in the
brains of human AD patients [19]. If amylin, which
is co-secreted with insulin, competes with A� for
degradation, promotes the deposition of A�, or accu-
mulates in plaques on the brain itself, this is another
strong mechanism by which T2DM and dementia
may be linked.
Remarkably, another set of recent studies appeared
to directly counter this conclusion by finding that
amylin exhibited a neuroprotective effect [21, 99,
100].Thesestudiesfoundthatinjectionofpramlintide
(an amylin analog), or rat/mouse amylin, appeared
to improve memory symptoms in mice engineered to
exhibit AD or accelerated senescence. Furthermore,
administration of pramlintide to humans appeared
to improve some learning and memory measures.
However, two important features of these recent stud-
 972
M.A. Schilling / Unraveling Alzheimer’s Disease
ies must be noted. First, the studies used rat/mouse
amylin, or pramlintide (synthetic amylin), both of
which have proline substitutions at positions 25, 28,
and 29 that limit amylin’s self-aggregating proper-
ties, thus rendering it non-amyloidogenic. Second, in
all the studies except for Qiu et al.’s study of home-
bound elderly [22], the subjects were diabetes free,
and thus likely had no deficiency in their IDE sys-
tem or excess of competing insulin. In the Qiu et al.
study of homebound elderly, the researchers found
some differences in memory scores across quartiles
of amylin levels across all subjects (including those
with diabetes), however these differences were not
monotonically increasing. Furthermore, the signifi-
cant differences they report in amylin levels across
AD patients, mild cognitive impairment patients, and
healthy persons were only for patients without dia-
betes.
Theprecedingsuggeststhatpramlintidemighthave
beneficial effects for people without diabetes. This
could be due to its role in preventing post-prandial
glucose spikes or by inhibiting glucagon, both of
which would collectively lessen insulin demand.
These mechanisms of potential benefit, however, are
speculative; the mechanism of pramlintide’s potential
neuroprotective effect is unclear. For people with dia-
betes, however, pramlintide seems far less likely to be
beneficial in AD. In people with diabetes, insulin and
amylin levels are already high, and may have already
exhausted their capacity for stimulating IDE produc-
tion and activity.
MALFUNCTION 4. EXCESS
PRODUCTION OF AN AMYLOIDOGENIC
PROTEIN, OR POSITIVE INTERACTIONS
BETWEEN AMYLOIDOGENIC
PROTEINS, RESULT IN AMYLOID
ACCUMULATION
Excess production of an amyloidogenic protein
can result in amyloid deposition outpacing amyloid
degradation, resulting in amyloid accumulation [36].
For example, mutations in the amyloid precursor pro-
tein gene (the gene associated with early-onset AD)
can increase the relative production of A�42, lead-
ing to amyloid deposition [37, 38]. Similarly, excess
production of amylin (as in T2DM) may directly
cause a build-up of amylin plaques on the brain [17].
There is also growing evidence that some amyloido-
genic proteins can foster the formation of amyloids of
other proteins, in a process known as “cross-seeding”
[39–41]. For example, alpha synuclein can initiate
tau amyloid formation, and then the two peptides can
increase the polymerization of each other [42]. Sim-
ilarly, amylin may interact with A� to increase its
formation of plaques [17–19].
IMPLICATIONS
The implications of the preceding are very impor-
tant, because the mechanism by which AD arises
strongly determines what treatments are likely to be
effective. If insulin deficiency is the main culprit, for
example, then intranasal insulin might be of signif-
icant benefit. If, however, hyperinsulinemia and/or
competitive inhibition of degradation of A� by a
degrading protease is the main cause, then adminis-
tering intranasal insulin could exacerbate the disease.
Furthermore, there is evidence that hyperinsulinemia
precedes the hyperglycemia of T2DM by many years
and it is likely the chronic overstimulation of insulin
receptors that leads to insulin resistance [35, 97, 101].
This suggests that extreme caution should be exer-
cised in giving a diabetic or pre-diabetic individual
extra insulin—it may just add fuel to the fire.
Theevidenceoverwhelminglysuggeststhattesting
for glucose tolerance should occur early and often.
There is no downside to glucose tolerance testing
other than minor cost, and the upside could be the
earlier identification and treatment of pre-diabetes
and diabetes. Given the evidence of a very strong
association between hyperinsulinemia and AD (and
other forms of dementia), every patient with AD or
mild cognitive impairment should be regularly tested
for glucose intolerance. Furthermore, obesity is also
strongly associated with hyperinsulinemia [97] and
diabetes [102], and thus, not surprisingly, increases
the risk of AD [103]. Given the widespread preva-
lence of obesity, pre-diabetes, and diabetes, glucose
intolerance testing should become a standard part of
regular health screening in the broader population.
According to the American Diabetes Association, of
the 29.1 million Americans with diabetes in 2012,
8.1 million (28%) were undiagnosed. Furthermore,
86 million Americans are estimated to be pre-diabetic
(i.e., have impaired glucose tolerance) and most will
have no symptoms that are recognizable without
medical testing [104]. Early identification of, and
intervention for, diabetes and prediabetes could sig-
nificantly lessen the impact of both diabetes and AD.
The review and arguments here suggest a few nec-
essary future studies:
 M.A. Schilling / Unraveling Alzheimer’s Disease
973
1. Insulin Deficiency versus Hyperinsulinemia
First, to test the competing hypotheses that it is
insulin deficiency versus hyperinsulinemia that cre-
ate or exacerbate AD (and thus the appropriateness
of administering intranasal insulin) mice (including
wild type, mice altered to develop AD, and mice
altered to develop both AD and hyperinsulinemia)
should be given chronic intranasal insulin and then
subjected to both cognitive testing and quantification
of amyloid burden and tauopathy. If the pathways to
AD posed in this paper are correct, intranasal insulin
should make AD in hyperinsulinemic mice worse.
Its effects on the other mice should be very informa-
tive: if it yields moderate neurological improvements
in the AD mice, this would support its use in non-
hyperinsulinemic AD patients. It might, however,
induce hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance lead-
ing to T2DM in the wild type mice, and both T2DM
and worsening of AD in the AD mice by competi-
tively inhibiting the breakdown of A�. Ideally a range
of doses of insulin will be used to assess potential
curvilinear effects.
2. Neuroprotective versus Competitive Inhibi-
tion Effects of Amylin and Pramlintide
Next, to assess the neuroprotective versus com-
petitive inhibition effects of amylin and pramlintide,
in vitro studies should first be conducted to assess
the degree to which pramlintide (rather than human
amylin) competitively inhibits the breakdown of A�.
If IDE responds primarily to the amyloidogenic
motif rather than particular amino acid sequences,
as suggested by Kurochkin [34] and others, perhaps
pramlintide competes less for breakdown of IDE
compared to human amylin. Next different groups
of mice (wild type, mice altered to develop AD and
hyperinsulinemia, mice altered to develop AD but
without hyperinsulinemia, and IDE knockout mice
altered to develop AD) should be chronically treated
with different amylins (pramlintide, human amylin),
at different dosage levels to observe the potential dif-
ferential effects of amylin and pramlintide depending
on the state of the insulin-IDE system of the sub-
ject. IDE inhibitors that can decrease (rather than
eliminate) IDE could also be used to more precisely
explore the relationships between intranasal insulin,
pramlintide, IDE, and AD [32, 105]. This should be
followed by cognitive testing and quantification of
amyloid burden and tauopathy. If the arguments about
competitive inhibition presented earlier are correct,
the administration of human amylin should exacer-
bate AD in all but the wild-type mice. I was unable to
find any studies of whether pramlintide competitively
inhibits the breakdown of A�, so it is impossible
to predict the outcome of the tests with pramlin-
tide. If, however, it turns out that pramlintide does
competitively inhibit the breakdown of A�, then its
administration should also exacerbate AD in all but
the wild-type mice.
If the results of the first set of studies above find
that hyperinsulinemia rather than insulin deficiency
exacerbates AD, then this implies that we should
be able to significantly lower rates of AD through
educating people about how to better manage their
blood sugar and insulin. A very large portion of the
population has little understanding of the glycemic
index of carbohydrates. Furthermore, very few peo-
ple know that some artificial sweeteners produce an
insulin response. This also yields a potential pol-
icy implication that perhaps food should be labeled
with a measure of its effect on insulin. The results of
the second study should help us to identify any AD
risks of administering pramlintide (which is already
given to many diabetic patients in addition to insulin
sensitizers) and help us to assess the overall reli-
ability, efficacy, and safety of administering these
drugs.
If the results of future studies support the argu-
ments made in this paper, then this suggests that much
more research should be done to identify the different
proteases that degrade A� in vivo, to better under-
stand their promoters and inhibitors, and to evaluate
the safety and efficacy of increasing the availabil-
ity of such proteases in both AD and diabetes.
Relatedly, it would be valuable to develop easily
administered diagnostic tests to identify protease
deficiencies.
Finally, the work here hints at some very fruit-
ful opportunities for extending the findings in AD to
better understand other neurodegenerative diseases
that involve protein aggregation in the brain. For
example, many of the studies cited here with IDE
knockout or IDE upregulated mice should be adapted
for studies of Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body demen-
tia, and Huntington’s disease. These latter diseases
have longer peptide sequences than IDE is thought
to degrade (IDE has been shown to only cleave pep-
tides of 50 amino acids or shorter [106]), but recent
studies indicate that IDE nonproteolytically inhibits
alpha synuclein fibril formation by binding to alpha
synuclein oligomers and preventing them from form-
ing amyloids [88], suggesting there could be great
promise in this research pathway.
