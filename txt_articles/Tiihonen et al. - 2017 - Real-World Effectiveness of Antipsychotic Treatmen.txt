IMPORTANCE It has remained unclear whether there are clinically meaningful differences
between antipsychotic treatments with regard to preventing relapse of schizophrenia, owing
to the impossibility of including large unselected patient populations in randomized clinical
trials, as well as residual confounding from selection biases in observational studies.
OBJECTIVE To study the comparative real-world effectiveness of antipsychotic treatments
for patients with schizophrenia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospectively gathered nationwide databases were
linked to study the risk of rehospitalization and treatment failure from July 1, 2006, to
December 31, 2013, among all patients in Sweden with a schizophrenia diagnosis who were
16 to 64 years of age in 2006 (29 823 patients in the total prevalent cohort; 4603 in the
incident cohort of newly diagnosed patients). Within-individual analyses were used for
primary analyses, in which each individual was used as his or her own control to eliminate
selection bias. Traditional Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression was used for
secondary analyses.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk of rehospitalization and treatment failure (defined as
psychiatric rehospitalization, suicide attempt, discontinuation or switch to other medication,
or death).
RESULTS There were 29 823 patients (12 822 women and 17 001 men; mean [SD] age, 44.9
[12.0] years). During follow-up, 13 042 of 29 823 patients (43.7%) were rehospitalized, and
20 225 of 28 189 patients (71.7%) experienced treatment failure. The risk of psychiatric
rehospitalization was the lowest during monotherapy with once-monthly long-acting
injectable paliperidone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41-0.64), long-acting injectable
zuclopenthixol (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.48-0.57), clozapine (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.48-0.58),
long-acting injectable perphenazine (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.52-0.65), and long-acting injectable
olanzapine (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44-0.77) compared with no use of antipsychotic medication.
Oral flupentixol (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74-1.14), quetiapine (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-1.00), and
oral perphenazine (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.97) were associated with the highest risk of
rehospitalization. Long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications were associated with
substantially lower risk of rehospitalization compared with equivalent oral formulations (HR,
0.78; 95% CI, 0.72-0.84 in the total cohort; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.86 in the incident
cohort). Clozapine (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53-0.63) and all long-acting injectable antipsychotic
medications (HRs 0.65-0.80) were associated with the lowest rates of treatment failure
compared with the most widely used medication, oral olanzapine. The results of several
sensitivity analyses were consistent with those of the primary analyses.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Clozapine and long-acting injectable antipsychotic
medications were the pharmacologic treatments with the highest rates of prevention of
relapse in schizophrenia. The risk of rehospitalization is about 20% to 30% lower during
long-acting injectable treatments compared with equivalent oral formulations.

 T
he comparative effectiveness of antipsychotic treat-
ments for patients with schizophrenia has remained
controversial despite extensive research. Results
from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) suggest that cloza-
pine, olanzapine, and amisulpiride are superior to other
antipsychotic medications in terms of efficacy.1-3 However,
the most efficacious drugs such as clozapine and olanzapine
frequently induce adverse effects, such as weight gain and
dyslipidemia, which may result in severe deterioration of
health after long-term treatment. Investigation of these
adverse effects or associated outcomes such as hospitaliza-
tion and death requires thousands of patients and several
years of follow-up to achieve enough statistical power, which
is not possible for RCTs.
Another major issue in RCTs is the selection of patients.
Those included in RCTs represent an atypical minority of
the patient population because up to 80% to 90% of
patients are excluded because of refusal, substance abuse,
suicidal or antisocial behavior, or mental or physical co-
morbidity.4 Especially problematic is the comparison
of oral antipsychotic medications vs long-acting injections
of antipsychotic medications because patients with the
poorest adherence (ie, those who would receive the greatest
benefit from long-acting injectable antipsychotic medica-
tions) are excluded from RCTs because participation is fully
voluntary. Because RCTs include only an atypical fraction of
the most adherent patients, they do not provide informa-
tion on the real-world effectiveness of the antipsychotic
treatments.
Observational studies can overcome some of the afore-
mentioned problems by using nationwide electronic data-
bases of hospitalization, mortality, and filled prescriptions.
Previous large nationwide and statewide cohort studies
have shown that clozapine, olanzapine, and long-acting
injections of other antipsychotic medications are associated
with better outcomes, that quetiapine is associated with
suboptimal outcomes, and that use of antipsychotic medi-
cations is associated with lower mortality compared with no
use.5-14 However, the main problem with these observa-
tional studies is selection bias. Although the most important
covariates such as sex, age, duration of illness, number of
previous hospitalizations, and history of suicidal behavior
and physical illness could be adjusted in the statistical
analysis, there always remains residual confounding associ-
ated with the personal characteristics of each patient. We
aimed to overcome this problem by using within-individual
analysis, in which each person is his or her own control. In
this approach, the exposure periods of each individual are
compared with the nonexposure periods of the same indi-
vidual. Therefore, the only factors that need to be adjusted
are those that change as a function of time, such as time
since cohort entry, temporal order of exposure periods,
and concomitant medications. The objective of our study
was to determine the effectiveness of antipsychotic treat-
ments for the prevention of psychiatric rehospitalization
and treatment failure in schizophrenia by applying within-
individual analysis to a nationwide cohort of patients with
schizophrenia.
Methods
We used nationwide register-based data to conduct a pro-
spective population-based cohort study of patients with
schizophrenia, as previously described.15 This research proj-
ect was approved by the Regional Ethics Board of Stockholm
(decision 2007/762-31). No informed consent is required for
register-based studies using anonymized data.
Study Population
The nationwide source population included all individuals
residing in Sweden who were 16 to 64 years of age in 2006
and who received a diagnosis of schizophrenia diagnosis
during the period from July 1, 2006, to December 31, 2013
(prevalent cohort). Moreover, an incident cohort was derived
of persons who received a diagnosis of schizophrenia for the
first time. The flowchart of the cohort is shown in Figure 1,
and the detailed information on the study population is
shown in the eAppendix in the Supplement.
Exposure
Drug use from the Prescribed Drug Register included drugs
prescribed during the period from 2005 to 2013 in outpatient
care because drugs used in hospitals are not recorded in the
registers. Drug use information in the register is categorized
according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)
classification,16 and the purchased amount is recorded in
defined daily dose (DDD) together with information on drug
package and formulation. Antipsychotics were defined as ATC
code N05A excluding lithium (ATC code N05AN01). Antipsy-
chotics used by the study cohort were further divided accord-
ing to drug formulation into oral antipsychotics and long-
acting injectables. Antipsychotics were also categorized into
first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics. The
detailed description on the drug use modeling is shown in the
eAppendix in the Supplement.
Outcomes
The main outcome measures in this study were psychiatric re-
hospitalization (including International Statistical Classifica-
tion of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision
Key Points
Question Are there any clinically meaningful differences between
specific antipsychotic medications or routes of administration
regarding the risk of psychiatric rehospitalization or other
treatment failure?
Findings This database study of a nationwide cohort of patients
using within-individual analysis to eliminate selection bias found
that clozapine and long-acting injections of antipsychotic
medications are associated with the lowest risk of
rehospitalization and treatment failure.
Meaning Clozapine and long-acting injections of antipsychotic
medications were the pharmacologic treatments with the highest
rates of prevention of relapse in schizophrenia.

 [ICD-10] codes F00-99) and treatment failure, defined as psy-
chiatric rehospitalization (including admissions due to sui-
cide attempts [ICD-10 codes X60-84]), discontinuation or
switch to other antipsychotic medication, or death. Because
clozapine is typically the last treatment option, the probabil-
ity of switching from clozapine to another antipsychotic medi-
cation may be low. Therefore, a secondary definition for treat-
ment failure included only psychiatric rehospitalization,
discontinuation of medication, or death (switch to another an-
tipsychotic medication was excluded). Psychiatric hospital-
ization was derived from the National Patient Register as in-
patient stay in the acute psychiatric ward or other psychiatric
ward for at least 24 hours. Other outcomes were all-cause
healthcarevisits(inpatientstayorspecializedoutpatientvisit).
Covariates
Within-individual models were adjusted for order of treat-
ments, time since cohort entry, and antipsychotic medica-
tion polypharmacy. Comorbid conditions were identified from
the National Patient Register, and drug use from the Pre-
scribed Drug Register. The traditional Cox proportional haz-
ards regression models were adjusted for sex, age at cohort en-
try,yearofcohortentry,timesincediagnosis,educationallevel,
marital status, comorbidities, and drug use. The exact defini-
tions are provided in the eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
All outcomes were recurrent and were analyzed with the
within-individual Cox proportional hazards regression model
as the main approach17 (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The
within-individual model is a stratified Cox proportional haz-
ards regression model in which each individual forms his or
her own stratum. In addition, follow-up time is reset to zero
after each outcome event to allow comparison of treatment
periods within each individual. Within-individual analyses
have been used in studies on psychotropic drug use and
criminality.17,18 We used the traditional multivariate-
adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model as sec-
ondary between-individual analyses. In within-individual
analysis, only individuals with variation in the exposure and
outcome contribute to the model, whereas in between-
individual analysis, all individuals contribute to the model.
We compared the effectiveness of antipsychotics by con-
sidering (1) time receiving monotherapy only and (2) time re-
ceiving any therapy. In the first approach (considering time
receiving monotherapy only), treatment periods were com-
bined into a single variable indicating either monotherapy
of a specified antipsychotic, polytherapy if any 2 or more anti-
psychotics were used at the same time, or no use of any anti-
psychotics. Events and risk time were accounted for a specific
antipsychotic only if they happened during monotherapy with
thatantipsychoticandforpolytherapyif2ormoreantipsychot-
ics were used at the same time.
In the second approach (considering time receiving any
therapy), treatment periods were defined by separate vari-
ables for each antipsychotic indicating either ongoing treat-
ment or no use of that antipsychotic. In this analysis, events
andrisktimewereaccountedforaspecificantipsychoticwhen-
ever that antipsychotic treatment was ongoing. In this ap-
proach, polytherapy was a separate variable that was ad-
justedforif2ormoreantipsychoticswereusedsimultaneously.
For treatment failure, oral olanzapine was used as a reference
drug because it was the drug used most often in the study
population. Treatment failure, indicated by discontinuation
or switch of antipsychotic medication, cannot happen to non-
users; thus, nonuse was not included in this analysis. We con-
ducted sensitivity analyses among the incident cohort to con-
trolforsurvivalbias.Whencomparingtheotherantipsychotics
(n = 20) with olanzapine, we set the level of significance at
P < .0025.
Results
During the follow-up of the prevalent cohort, 13 042 of 29 823
patients (43.7%) experienced psychiatric rehospitalization and
20 225 of 28 189 patients (71.7%) had treatment failure. The
mean duration of follow-up in the total cohort was 5.7 years
(median, 6.9 years). The clinical and sociodemographic
characteristics of the cohorts are described in eTable 2 in the
Supplement. Oral olanzapine was the most frequently used
drug, and zuclopenthixol the most frequently used as a long-
acting injectable antipsychotic medication (eTable 3 in the
Supplement).

(HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.48-0.58), long-acting injectable perphen-

able olanzapine (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44-0.77) (Figure 2). The
highest risk of rehospitalization was seen with oral flupen-
tixol(HR,0.92;95%CI,0.74-1.14)andquetiapine(HR,0.91;95%
CI, 0.83-1.00). When adjusting for the use of concomitant an-
tidepressant and benzodiazepine use, we found that the re-
sults remained almost identical (eFigure 2 in the Supple-
ment). When compared with the most frequently used
antipsychotic, oral olanzapine, clozapine (HR, 0.84; 95% CI,
0.76-0.93; P < .001), and long-acting injectable zuclopen-
thixol (0.83; 0.75-0.92; P < .001) were associated with signifi-
cantly lower risk of rehospitalization, and oral flupentixol (HR,
1.46; 95% CI, 1.17-1.82; P < .001), quetiapine (HR, 1.43; 95% CI,
1.29-1.59;P < .001),andoralhaloperidol(HR,1.28;95%CI,1.12-
1.48; P < .001) were associated with a significantly higher risk
of rehospitalization after Bonferroni correction. In within-
individual analysis, the risk of rehospitalization was 22% lower
during use of long-acting injectable antipsychotic medica-
tions compared with use of corresponding oral formulations
(HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.72-0.84; P < .001).
Theincidenceratesoftreatmentfailureduringeachmono-
therapy compared with oral olanzapine are shown in eTable
5 in the Supplement, and the adjusted HRs of treatment fail-
ure during each monotherapy compared with oral olanza-
pine are shown in Figure 3. The lowest risk of treatment fail-
ure was observed for clozapine (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53-0.63),
and the second lowest was seen for all long-acting injectable
antipsychoticmedications(HRs,0.65-0.80),whereasthehigh-
est risk was seen for levomepromazine (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-
1.28). When adjusting for the concomitant use of antidepres-
santsandbenzodiazepines,wefoundthattheresultsremained
the same (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). A secondary head-
to-head analysis including only patients who had used oral
olanzapine during the follow-up showed almost identical rank
order (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). When a switch to an-
other antipsychotic medication was not included in the defi-
nition of treatment failure, clozapine was still associated with
the best outcome (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53-0.64) compared with
oral olanzapine.

tion and treatment failure during any specific treatment (also

 The results observed in secondary between-individual
analysis for psychiatric rehospitalization and treatment failure
are shown in eFigures 9 and 10 in the Supplement. The results
of sensitivity analysis regarding psychiatric rehospitalization
and treatment failure among the incident cohort are shown in
the Table and eTable 5 in the Supplement, and adjusted risks
are shown in eFigures 11 and 12 in the Supplement. In the in-
cident cohort, the risk of psychiatric rehospitalization was 32%
lower during treatment with long-acting injectable antipsy-
chotic medications compared with treatment with equivalent
oral formulations (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.86).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the com-
parative effectiveness of antipsychotic treatments for pa-
tients with schizophrenia using within-individual Cox pro-
portional hazards regression analysis. This method enables
correction for selection biases because each individual serves
as his or her own control. For example, if individuals willing
to use clozapine or long-acting injectable antipsychotic medi-
cations differed from other patients concerning the intrinsic
severity of their illness or adherence with treatment, the pu-
tative bias is eliminated by comparing the risk during use of a
specific medication with the risk during no use of that medi-
cation within the same individual. The association of time-
dependent factors such as duration of the disease, use of con-
comitant medications, and temporal order of exposure and
nonexposure periods (such as a switch from an oral formula-
tion to a long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication vs
from a long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication to an
oral formulation) with relapse of schizophrenia was taken into
account. Although continuous use of antipsychotics is recom-
mended for the prevention of relapse of schizophrenia, treat-
ments are often started when the patient’
s clinical state dete-
riorates, and, therefore, the HRs may be slightly overestimated
for all treatments. However, it is unlikely that there would be
systematic differences between different medications in this
regard.
Ourresultsfromalargenationwidecohortshowthatcloza-
pine and long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications are
substantially more effective than other antipsychotics in re-
ducing the risk of rehospitalization or any treatment failure.
The most consistent findings were observed for clozapine,
being the first in rank order in most of the analyses. These re-
sults are in line with those of previous cohort studies using tra-
ditional between-individual analyses,6,8,14,19 although the ef-
fect sizes differed to some extent, especially for comparisons
between long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications and
corresponding oral formulations. Our results showed that the
risk of rehospitalization was 22% lower during treatment with
long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications compared
with treatment with equivalent oral formulations in the total
cohort and 32% lower in the incident cohort of newly diag-
nosed patients. This finding is in line with those of Alphs
et al,20 indicating that use of long-acting injectable antipsy-
chotic medications results in the greatest benefit during the
early phase of the illness. Previous RCTs comparing long-
acting injectable antipsychotic medications and oral formu-
lations among patients with chronic schizophrenia have not
found significant differences,21,22 probably owing to the fact
that patients having the biggest potential benefit are not in-
cluded in RCTs.
However, the first direct comparison of long-acting inject-
able antipsychotic medication vs oral formulation of the same
second-generation antipsychotic for patients with their first
episode of schizophrenia found that the use of long-acting in-
jectable antipsychotic medication was associated with an 85%
lower risk of relapse,23 which also suggests that the greatest
benefit of long-acting injectable antipsychotic medications is
achieved among newly diagnosed patients. The sensitivity
analyses among our incident cohort, as well as the use of tra-
ditional between-individual analyses, gave rather similar re-
sultsasthoseoftheprimarywithin-individualanalysesamong
the total cohort. Head-to-head analyses restricted to patients
who used olanzapine, as well as analyses using monotherapy
and any therapy including polypharmacy, also showed con-
sistent outcomes. The results were similar for rehospitaliza-
tion and treatment failure (also including discontinuation or
switch of medication), which suggests that the good out-
comes are mediated by good adherence. The better outcomes
associated with clozapine and long-acting injectable antipsy-
chotic medications may be partly explained by the more regu-
lar contact with medical staff necessitated by blood samples
and injections. However, from the view of patients and their
families,itisirrelevantwhichspecificfactorinthechosentreat-
ment plan contributes most to the outcome. From a societal
perspective, more frequent visits to a health care profes-
sional increase costs, but as the savings from decreased re-
hospitalization are much greater, the economical net effect is
positive.
It is remarkable that the risk of psychiatric rehospitaliza-
tion, being a marker for relapse, was about 40% to 70% higher
during monotherapy with quetiapine than during mono-
therapy with clozapine, oral olanzapine, or the most fre-
quently used long-acting injectable antipsychotic medica-
tions. Because 44% of patients were rehospitalized, the
differences in the observed HRs correspond to substantial dif-
ferences in absolute risks. Quetiapine has been the most com-
monly used antipsychotic in many countries. Although dosing
was probably too low when it was initially introduced, that was
not the case during the follow-up of our study (average dose,
360 mg/d, equaling 0.90 DDD/d). Our results are in line with
those of previous studies8,14 suggesting that quetiapine should
not be used routinely as monotherapy for patients with schizo-
phrenia without specific reasons. Although between-
individual analysis gave otherwise consistent results com-
pared with within-individual analyses, the results for oral
flupentixol were substantially more favorable in the between-
individual analysis for risk of psychiatric rehospitalization.
This finding suggests that this agent was used among pa-
tients with a lower intrinsic risk of relapse (which was the case
as can be seen in the Table) and that between-individual analy-
sis was not able to fully adjust for this factor. This finding is in
line with the fact that oral flupentixol was used in low doses

 (mean dose, 2.1 mg/d, equaling 0.35 DDD/d), which may ex-
plain its relatively low effectiveness in the primary within-
individual analysis. Although long-acting injectable zuclopen-
thixol was among the drugs associated with the lowest risk of
psychiatric rehospitalization, this finding does not take into
account the frequency of extrapyramidal adverse effects that
may affect patients’quality of life. The effect of each individu-
al’
s adherence to treatment was adjusted in the between-
individual analysis. Also, in this analysis, long-acting inject-
able antipsychotic medications except olanzapine and
flupenthixol (relatively few patients and large CIs) were asso-
ciatedwithalowerriskofpsychiatricrehospitalizationortreat-
ment failure. However, it is probable that adherence is a ma-
jor factor explaining better outcomes with long-acting
injectable antipsychotic medications, and the rationale for de-
veloping long-acting injectable formulations was to improve
adherence. Our results show that many first-generation oral
formulations of antipsychotic medications were used at low
doses. Because our data are not about the prescribed doses but
about the actual mean amount of purchased medications dur-
ing the follow-up, it is plausible that patients may have ad-
justed their oral doses lower than prescribed, while this is not
possible when long-acting injectable antipsychotic medica-
tions are used.
Strengths and Limitations
The strength of observational studies using nationwide data-
bases is that there are no missing data on rehospitalization or
treatmentfailure,whereasinRCTs,thedropoutratesareabout
50% to 60% of the patients, leading to missing data.24 Our da-
tabase did not include information on symptoms, function-
ing, tardive dyskinesia, or quality of life; therefore, rehospi-
talization and treatment failure were the only outcome
measures. Although time-dependent factors such as aging are
adjusted in the within-individual analysis, there always re-
mains the possibility of residual confounding associated with
thepassingofcalendartime.Forexample,wedidnothavedata
on concomitant treatment with psychological therapies or on
the use of mood stabilizers. However, it is unlikely that there
wouldbesystematicdifferencesbetweenantipsychoticsinthis
regard. The strengths of this study include nationwide cover-
ageofpatientswithschizophreniainareal-lifesettingandcom-
plete coverage of drug purchases from register-based data.
Within-individual analyses fully adjust for patient-
related characteristics that may affect drug effectiveness and
tolerability. Observational mirror-image studies also do this,
but their major limitation is that patients switch from oral for-
mulations to long-acting injectable antipsychotic medica-
tions (not vice versa), and the effect of temporal order cannot
becontrolled.Asonlythoseexperiencinganadverseeventand
having variation in the exposure are included in the within-
individual analyses, we also conducted between-individual
comparisons including all patients, which revealed similar re-
sults as the primary analyses. Survival bias was eliminated by
restricting secondary analyses to incident cases. Drug use was
modeled with the state-of-the-art Prescriptions to Drug Use
Periods (PRE2DUP) method, which describes actual drug use
well when compared with interview-reported use.25 Our re-
sults on the comparative effectiveness of specific antipsychot-
ics can be generalized only to white populations and high-
income countries in which all antipsychotic treatments are
reimbursed by the state.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that there are substantial differences be-
tween specific antipsychotic agents and between routes of ad-
ministration concerning the risk of rehospitalization and treat-
ment failure among patients with schizophrenia.
