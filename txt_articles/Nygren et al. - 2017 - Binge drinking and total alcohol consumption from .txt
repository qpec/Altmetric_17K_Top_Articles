Abstract
Background: Studies have indicated that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with lower incidence of
diabetes in women. However, not only the amount but also the drinking pattern could be of importance when
assessing the longitudinal relation between alcohol and glucose. Also, there is a lack of studies on alcohol use
beginning in adolescence on adult glucose levels. The aim was to examine the association between total alcohol
consumption and binge drinking between ages 16 and 43 and fasting plasma glucose at age 43.
Methods: Data were retrieved from a 27-year prospective cohort study, the Northern Swedish Cohort. In 1981,
all 9th grade students (n = 1083) within a municipality in Sweden were invited to participate. There were
re-assessments at ages 18, 21, 30 and 43. This particular study sample consisted of 897 participants (82.8%).
Fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) was measured at a health examination at age 43. Total alcohol consumption
(in grams) and binge drinking were calculated from alcohol consumption data obtained from questionnaires.
Results: Descriptive analyses showed that men had higher levels of fasting plasma glucose as compared to
women. Men also reported higher levels of alcohol consumption and binge drinking behavior. Linear regressions
showed that total alcohol consumption in combination with binge drinking between ages 16 and 43 was
associated with elevated fasting plasma glucose at age 43 in women (beta = 0.14, p = 0.003) but not in men
after adjustment for BMI, hypertension and smoking at age 43.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that reducing binge drinking and alcohol consumption among young
and middle-aged women with the highest consumption might be metabolically favorable for their future
glucose metabolism.

 Background
Several studies have indicated that moderate alcohol
consumption is associated with reduced risk for type 2
diabetes [1–3], and that women seem to benefit more
from moderate alcohol consumption than men [1]. The
association has been reported to be J-shaped i.e. low to
moderate consumers have a lower risk of diabetes com-
pared to both abstainers but also high alcohol consumers
[4] The J-shaped association has been taken as proof of
one of the benefits of alcohol. However, as suggested by
the J-shaped association, high alcohol consumers are at
high risk of developing type 2 diabetes or the metabolic
syndrome [5]. This was found in e.g. the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey where persons with
high alcohol consumption or who engaged in binge drink-
ing behavior had an increased risk of the metabolic syn-
drome [6], a finding which was corroborated in a Swedish
cohort study [7]. The Swedish cohort study also showed
that high alcohol consumption and binge drinking in-
creased the risk of type 2 diabetes as well as pre-diabetes
for men, but not for women [7].Also, a recent meta-
analysis of prospective studies suggested that heavy
drinking was associated with the metabolic syndrome
that includes an increase in blood glucose [8].
The majority of the studies on the association between
alcohol consumption and glucose have been performed
in adults. Little is known about the effect of alcohol
consumption as an adolescent on glucose concentra-
tions in adult life. However, in a longitudinal study who
followed a group of adolescents (mean age 15.7) until
they were young adults (mean age 28.7) reported an in-
creased risk of diabetes in those who consumed alcohol
3–7 days per week [9].
Taken together, there is a lack of longitudinal studies
studying the association between alcohol consumption
and blood glucose following adolescents until adulthood.
Thus, our aim was to examine the association between
total alcohol consumption and binge drinking from 16
to 43 years of age and fasting plasma glucose measured
at age 43.
Methods
Data were based on the prospective longitudinal cohort
study called the Northern Swedish Cohort [10]. In 1981,
all pupils (n = 1083) aged 16 years who attended or
should have attended the final year of the compulsory
school in a middle-sized municipality in northern Sweden
participated in the study. There have been four follow-up
surveys at ages 18, 21, 30, and 43. At age 16, the participa-
tion rate was 99.7% (1080/1083). In the final follow-up,
94.3% (1010/1071) of those still alive (12 persons had
passed away) participated in the study.
The study sample used in the present study consisted
of 897 persons (433 women, 464 men); participants who
did not have data on fasting plasma glucose (n = 86). as
Also, participants who at any follow-up reported having
type 1 diabetes (n = 10) or type 2 diabetes (n = 17) were
excluded due to a risk of their fPG being affected as a
consequence of their disease. Type 2 diabetes is a com-
plex disease affecting many organs that are involved in
glucose regulation; thus, having a type 2 diagnose might
confound the relationship between fPG per se and alcohol
consumption. Secondly, they filled in the questionnaire
after their diagnosis, which increased the risk of recall bias.
Finally, they were too few to perform sub-group analysis
on. Body Mass Index (BMI) and hypertension at age 43
was higher for cohort participants who were not included
for this study (mean BMI = 29.6 ± 8.3, hypertension
45.6%) than for the study sample (mean BMI =26.7 ± 4.7,
p-value = 0.02, hypertension 24.8%, p-value = <0.001). No
significant differences were observed between the two
groups regarding alcohol consumption.
Ethical approvals were given by the Regional Ethics
Review Boards in Uppsala and Umeå, Sweden. According
to Swedish law (Swedish Ethical Review Act 2003; 460,
§17), written consents are not required in a questionnaire
study such as ours. Instead, each respondent is viewed as
giving his/her written consent when answering the ques-
tionnaire. The participants of the study were informed of
their right to opt out at any time simply by not completing
any wave(s) of the survey.
Measurements
The participants underwent a clinical health examination
at age 43. A blood sample was drawn after an overnight
fast, and fasting plasma glucose (fPG) was analyzed
(Vitros, 5.1 FS, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics J&J, Raritan,
NJ). External quality assurance in laboratory medicine in
Sweden (EQUALIS) managed external quality control.
Weight (kg) and height (m) were measured at age 16
and 43 according to the World Health Organization
Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants
in Cardiovascular Disease (WHO MONICA) manual [11],
and BMI was calculated (kg/m2). BMI was also dichoto-
mized into normal weight (BMI <25) and overweight/
obese (BMI ≥25) [12]. Health examinations at age 43 also
included measures of participants’ waist circumference
and blood pressure, measured according to WHO [11].
Participants were coded as 1 = hypertensive (a blood pres-
sure level ≥ 140/90 mmHg or being treated with anti-
hypertensive medication) or 0 = normotensive.
Questionnaire data
The participants responded to a questionnaire at each sur-
vey regarding issues such as their health status, lifestyle,
and socio-economic conditions.
Alcohol consumption. The participants responded to
eight ordinal-scale questions concerning their consumption

 of medium-strength beer, strong beer, wine, and spirits.
The participants were asked questions concerning fre-
quency, ‘How often do you drink beer?’
, and volume
‘How much beer do you usually drink at each occasion?’.
Standard drink units according to Swedish National In-
stitute of Public Health standards were used [13–15].
One standard drink contained 12 g of ethanol, which in
turn equaled 4 cl spirits (40% pure ethanol), 12–15 cl
wine (11–13% pure ethanol), 33 cl strong beer (5–6%
pure ethanol), or 50 cl medium-strength beer (2–3%
pure ethanol).
The total alcohol consumption between ages 16 and 43
was calculated in a step-wise manner. Frequency (oc-
casions per year) and volume (grams of alcohol per
occasion) variables were created, after which they were
multiplied for each type of alcohol and the totals for
each type of alcohol were summed. To calculate the alco-
hol consumption for the years in between the follow-ups,
an area under the curve (trapezium rule) was calculated
(see Fig. 1) [16]. Alcohol consumption at ages 16, 18, 21,
30, and 43 were assumed to be representative (mean
values) of longer time-spans. The number of years be-
tween each follow-up was divided in two, where the first
half was credited to the former follow-up and the second
half was credited to the latter follow-up. The alcohol con-
sumption mean values were multiplied by years as follows:
the alcohol consumption level at age 16 was multiplied by
1 (age 16 to 17); the alcohol consumption level at age 18
was multiplied by 2.5 (age 17 to 19.5). At age 21, the alco-
hol consumption level was multiplied by 6 (age 19.5 to
25.5). The alcohol consumption level at age 30 was multi-
plied by 11.5 (age 25.5 to 37), and the alcohol consump-
tion level at age 43 was multiplied by 7 (from age 37 to
and including age 43). The consumption measures for
each time-span were then added to a measure (grams of
pure alcohol) of total alcohol consumption from 16 years
of age to 43 years of age.
In addition, total alcohol consumption variables were
created for each type of alcohol (beer, wine and spirits).
Total alcohol consumption ages 16 to 43 was also di-
vided into quintiles for descriptive purposes.
Binge drinking between ages 16 and 43 was also calcu-
lated in several steps. First, binge drinking was defined
as drinking 4 or more standard drinks of beer, wine or
spirits per occasion for women (5 or more standard
drinks for men) at least once a month [17, 18]. This vari-
able was coded as 0 = ‘not binge drinking’ and 1 = ‘binge
drinking’. Second, a composite measure of binge drink-
ing between ages 16–43 was created, in which time
between data collection points were accounted for. Each
dichotomous binge drinking measures was multiplied
with a certain number of years, estimated by the data
collection closest in time; in other words, the multi-
plicative procedure was the same as in the total alcohol
consumption variable (binge drinking at age 16*1 year,
binge drinking at age 18*2.5 years, binge drinking at
age 21*6 years, binge drinking at age 30*11.5 years, and
binge drinking at age 43*7 years), creating an index
ranging from 0 to 28. Binge drinking between ages 16
and 43 was thus defined as number of years during
which the respondent reported binge drinking.
A combined total alcohol consumption and binge
drinking variable (ages 16 to 43) was also created in
order to examine the combined effect of the two alcohol
variables. The total alcohol consumption variable between
ages 16 and 43 was dichotomized at the 75th percentile
(cut-offs were 33,155 g for women and 95,536 g for men),
and coded as 0 = ‘total alcohol consumption below 75th
percentile’ and 1 = ‘total alcohol consumption above 75th
percentile’ [19]. The binge drinking between ages 16 and
43 variable was dichotomized and coded as 0 = ‘no binge
drinking’ and 1 = ‘between one and twenty-eight years of
binge drinking’. The two dichotomized variables were
then combined and coded as 0 = ‘no binge drinking and

‘either between one and twenty-eight years of binge drink-
ing or total alcohol consumption over 75th percentile’

Family history of diabetes and working-class parents at
age 16. At age 16, the participants indicated whether any
of their parents or siblings had diabetes. Participants’
working-class background was measured with an open-
ended question concerning the current or previous
occupations of their parents. The responses were classi-
fied according to a Swedish classification system [20]
and added into a combined variable coded as 0 = ‘no
working-class parent’
, 1 = ‘one working-class parent’
, or
2 = ‘two working-class parents’.
Smoking, intake of sugary foods, and exercise at age 16
and 43. These covariates were based on ordinal scale
level questionnaire items. Smoking ranged from 0 = ‘non-
smoker’ to 4 = ‘smokes more than 20 cigarettes per day’.
Intake of sugary foods ranged from 0 = ‘more seldom than
once a week’ to 4 = ‘several times a day’. Finally, exercise
habits ranged from 0 = ‘daily’ to 5 = ‘seldom/never’.
All covariates were also dichotomized for descriptive
purposes.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as number (n), proportions (%), median
values (interquartile range, IQR) and mean values (stand-
ard deviations, SD). All analyses were performed separately
for men and women. Differences between two groups were
tested with Chi-squared tests, Mann–Whitney U test,
or Student’s t-test. Differences between more than two
groups were tested through Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA). ANOVA analyses also included a test for linear
trend of the mean fPG values between the groups.
In preliminary analyses of the relationship between
fPG and total alcohol consumption between ages 16 and
43, we also performed scatter plots, residual plots, and
tests for a quadratic trend. The quadratic trend was ex-
amined by performing multivariable linear regressions
with a mean centered total alcohol consumption variable
and a quadratic mean centered total alcohol consump-
tion variable as independent variables.
Univariate and multivariable linear regression were
used to examine the associations between alcohol con-
sumption with fPG as the dependent variable. In the
multivariable analysis, we included the independent
variables that were significantly associated with fPG in
the univariate analysis; i.e. all non-significant covariates
were excluded. Due to strong correlations between the
alcohol consumption variables, three separate multivar-
iable models were presented. Collinearity was found be-
tween BMI at ages 16 and 43, resulting in the exclusion
of BMI at age 16 from the multivariable analysis.
Due to significant interaction between gender and
BMI at age 43 (beta 0.71, p = 0.002), a subsequent linear
regression analysis was performed in which we stratified
for BMI (BMI <25 and BMI ≥25) at age 43. In all other
analyses, BMI was used as a continuous variable. All
multivariable linear regressions included a test of collin-
earity by estimation of variance inflation factor.
We performed a sensitivity analysis in which we ex-
cluded five total alcohol consumption outliers. These
were participants (four men, one woman) who reported
an alcohol consumption of more than 800,000 g of pure
alcohol, significantly higher as compared to other study
participants. A second sensitivity analysis was performed
in which participants who had never reported drinking
alcohol were excluded.
The significance level for all analyses was *p < 0.05
(two-sided). All analyses were performed using IBM-
SPSS version 21.
Results
Men had higher fPG compared to women at age 43 and
had consumed almost three times as much alcohol as
women from 16 to 43 years of age (Table 1). In addition,
a larger proportion of men reported binge drinking.
There were more men than women who were overweight
and obese at age 43 but not at age 16, and more men
reported exercising a few times a month or more seldom
at age 43. However, more women were daily smokers
compared to men at age 16 and 43 (Table 1).
A larger proportion of those who reported binge
drinking at age 16 still engaged in that behavior at age
18 as compared to those who did not report binge
drinking at age 16. This relationship was accentuated
for women until age 21, but continued for men
throughout all follow-ups (Table 2), which indicate that
consumption patterns set in adolescence may be per-
sistent later in life.
Table 3 showed significant differences in fPG levels
between different categories of alcohol consumption for
women, but not for men. There was a significant linear
trend in the ANOVA analyses for women with regards
to total alcohol consumption between ages 16 and 43
(p-value girls = 0.001, p-value boys = 0.65) and with
regards to binge drinking between ages 16 and 43 (p-
value girls = <0.001, p-value boys = 0.904). The largest
fPG increase was found in the top quintiles of alcohol
consumption. The quadratic term for the combined
total consumption/binge drinking variable was however
not significant.
Scatter plots on fPG and total alcohol consumption
between ages 16 and 43 showed R2 = 0.015 for women
and R2 = 0.002 for men, while the residual plot showed
R2 = 0 for both women and men, indicating possible linear
relationship the two variables. In addition, a multivariable

 linear regression analysis showed an insignificant quad-
ratic trend (p-value = 0.134, VIF = 2.28) for the total alco-
hol consumption (ages 16 to 43) and fPG association.
Table 4 shows differences in dichotomized covariates
with regards to fPG, total alcohol consumption and
binge drinking (ages 16 to 43). Those who reported BMI
<25, irregular exercise habits and hypertension at age 43
also had higher levels of fPG, total alcohol consumption,
and binge drinking (ages 16 to 43). The patterns were
similar between the two alcohol consumption variables.
In the univariate linear regression analyses, BMI,
smoking, and hypertension at age 43 were associated
with fPG at age 43 (Table 5) for women. In addition,
fPG was univariately associated with all three alcohol
consumption variables (total alcohol consumption, binge
drinking, and the combined binge drinking-total alcohol

 consumption variable) for women. This was in contrast
to men where only hypertension at age 43, BMI and ex-
ercise at age 16 and 43 were associated with fPG.
In the multivariable analyses, the total alcohol consump-
tion variable (adjusted R2 = 0.112), the binge drinking
variable (adjusted R2 = 0.107) as well as the combination
of binge drinking and total alcohol consumption variable
(adjusted R2 = 0.111) remained significantly associated
with fPG among women, even after adjusting for BMI,
hypertension and smoking at age 43 (Table 6). For men,
only BMI and hypertension at age 43 remained associ-
ated with fPG in the multivariable analysis (adjusted
R2 = 0.118).
We tested other cut-offs in the multivariable linear re-
gressions for the combined binge drinking and total alco-
hol consumption variable, but the association remained
(data not shown). Stratifying for BMI at age 43 to examine
the possible role of BMI as an effect modifier did not
change the results significantly (data not shown). When
added to the multivariable regressions, waist circumfer-
ence at age 43 as well as weight change between ages 16
and 43 showed similar association as for BMI at age 43
(data not shown). Moreover, since family history of dia-
betes, weight change, and working class are known risk
factors for diabetes, all three variables were inserted as
confounders in the same multivariate regression analysis;
however, this did not change the results in a significant
way (data not shown). Finally, excluding five possible total
alcohol consumption outliers and never-consumers did
not significantly alter the results.
Discussion
In this unique study with 27 years of follow-up, we
found that higher alcohol consumption, together with
binge drinking behavior, was associated with high fasting
plasma glucose in adult women. The association was
found in women independent of their BMI, smoking be-
havior, or them being hypertensive. These findings are in
contrast to some previous studies in adults that showed
that women who were moderate alcohol consumers
(~24 g/d) had a lower risk for developing type 2 diabetes
[1, 2]. However, as noted in a recent meta-analysis,
women consuming large amounts (>50 g/d) of alcohol
had an increased risk of diabetes [2].
Furthermore, our results did not show that being over-
weight/obese modified the relationship between alcohol
consumption and fPG, which also stands in contrast to
previous studies [1, 21]. There are several possible expla-
nations for the discrepancies between our results and
those of previous studies. First, previous studies were
performed in adults, where other conditions such as
long-term obesity or liver disease could confound the
association between alcohol consumption and fPG. Our
sample was followed from youth through middle age
with the same questionnaire and only a few had devel-
oped a severe drinking problem that could have resulted

 in severe liver disease. Secondly, most of the previous
studies have used different categories of consumers as
reference category, and if a study cannot separate ab-
stainers from former drinkers, this could confound the
association and contribute to the U-shape of the associ-
ation curve in their logistic models [1]. In contrast, we
relied on continuous variables as both the dependent
(fPG) and independent (total alcohol consumption) vari-
ables thereby avoiding the reference category problem.
Thirdly, it is difficult to compare our measure of total
alcohol consumption with the cross sectional data of
consumption per day as in previous reports.
There are some mechanistic studies that might explain
the association. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
studies in men have shown that ethanol increased in-
sulin resistance by competing with the oxidation of
e.g. carbohydrates [22]. Moreover, it has been shown
in rats that binge drinking increased hypothalamic in-
flammation and expression of protein tyrosine phos-
phatase 1B (PTP1B) which is a negative regulator of
insulin signaling [23].
Differences in associations between higher alcohol
consumption and elevated glucose levels between men
and women are difficult to explain; however, the differ-
ence in effect of alcohol has been noted in several other
studies [1, 3] but none of these studies have been able to
identify any mechanistic explanations to the observed
gender difference. Thus, more experimental studies
are needed.
Strengths and limitations
The methodological strengths of the present study were
its design consisting of a prospective cohort study span-
ning over 27 years and its very high retention rate. The
question about selection bias must always be addressed.
The cohort consists of all pupils in the last year of
compulsory school in a whole municipality in Northern
Sweden
and
has,
during
the
long-term
follow-up,
retained a very high response rate. The cohort has also
proved to be representative of the corresponding age
group in Sweden with regard to demographic, health-
related and socioeconomic factors [10, 13]. Thus, the

 selection bias in this study is low. However, in a closed
cohort such as this, the cohort is more ethnically
homogenous compared to Sweden today [10]. Another
methodological strength is that we analyzed three types
of alcohol consumption measures, thereby covering both
consumption levels and patterns, which has been shown
as important by previous research [24].
The measure of total alcohol consumption and binge
drinking between ages 16 and 43 were determined using
the trapezium rule in an area under the curve calcula-
tion, which has the advantage including duration of time
in longitudinal studies. This approach has been recom-
mended in serial measurement studies [25, 26]. These
are approximations because we have no information
about participants’ drinking habits between the follow-
ups. However, prospective studies are highly desirable
for lifetime measures of alcohol consumption as com-
pared with retrospective studies [25, 27]. The question-
naire items on alcohol consumption were phrased e.g.
‘How often do you drink wine?’ and ‘How much wine do
you usually drink on each occasion?’. As in all self-
reported survey items, there is a general risk of recall

 bias when the cohort participants were asked to report
on their alcohol consumption. A test-retest investigation
was performed at baseline, in which the results from
four of the 46 included school classes in Northern Swedish
Cohort was compared with a study two weeks later that
used exactly the same alcohol questionnaire. Overall, the
comparison showed high degree of conformity between
the two studies.
Using a continuous measure also has the advantage of
not reducing variation in the data due to categorization.
In our regression analyses, we tried to avoid this by
using not collapsing our continuous or ordinal scale
variables into different categories. The disadvantage of
measuring the cumulative volume in alcohol consump-
tion is that we run the risk of losing information about
the consumption patterns, i.e. different consumption
patterns may result in the same volume consumed. We
have attempted to avoid this by adding the binge drink-
ing measurement. The definition of binge drinking
comprised the quantity of the alcohol consumed per
occasion within a certain time-frame (at least once a
month), and taking gender into account. This way of
defining binge drinking was suggested in a review of
binge drinking measurements in epidemiological studies
[17]. The review also suggested to include a third variable,
time-frame of consumption (e.g. within two hours); how-
ever, we did not have access to such data.Future studies
are important to elaborate on the importance of alcohol
consumption patterns in the population.
When creating the alcohol consumption variables,
we used the concept of a ‘standard drink’
, defined by
the Public Health Agency of Sweden as containing
12 g of alcohol [18]. The amount of alcohol in a stand-
ard drink differs somewhat between countries [18, 28],
which is important to consider when making inter-
national comparisons.
Although the results in Model 3 (Table 6) might be
interpreted as binge drinking having an additional and
increased risk in relation to fPG beyond that of total al-
cohol consumption, we cannot make such conclusions.
Due to limitations in our sample size, we are not able to
make certain claims of the independent role of binge
drinking. Moreover, we cannot assess the exact mechan-
ism behind the observed association because we do not
have any information on liver function, gluconeogenesis,
insulin resistance, etc. Also, although self-reports of
alcohol consumption are considered rather valid, it is
important to consider tendencies either under- or over-
estimate self-reports [29]. Linear regressions were per-
formed when possible outliers were excluded but the
results were practically the same. Another limitation of
our study was that we did not have access to data on
fPG at age 16, polycystic ovary syndrome or data on
gestational diabetes at age 43.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study shows that high alcohol con-
sumption ages 16–43 was associated with increased fast-
ing plasma glucose for non-diabetic women. A raised
blood glucose concentration is the significantly most
important risk factor for future development of type 2
diabetes. Thus, our findings indicate that reducing binge
drinking and alcohol consumption among young and
middle-aged
women
with
the
highest
consumption
might be of benefit for reducing their risk of developing
type 2 diabetes with its long term complications.
The public health relevance of this paper is that early
interventions directed towards prevention of adolescent
alcohol consumption are important for prevention of the
development of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. Our findings
have a broader implication for public health as alcohol
consumption in adolescence can be regarded as an exter-
nalizing symptom of mental ill health [30, 31]. Thus, our
study indicates the long-term public health consequences
of early mental ill health. Future research is needed about
the possible mechanisms from a life-course perspective.
