 Oral Pharmacologic Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Clinical
Practice Guideline Update From the American College of Physicians
Amir Qaseem, MD, PhD, MHA; Michael J. Barry, MD; Linda L. Humphrey, MD, MPH; and Mary Ann Forciea, MD; for the Clinical
Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians*
Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) devel-
oped this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical
recommendations on oral pharmacologic treatment of type 2
diabetes in adults. This guideline serves as an update to the
2012 ACP guideline on the same topic. This guideline is en-
dorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.
Methods: This guideline is based on a systematic review of ran-
domized, controlled trials and observational studies published
through December 2015 on the comparative effectiveness of
oral medications for type 2 diabetes. Evaluated interventions
included metformin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, dipepti-
dyl
peptidase-4
(DPP-4)
inhibitors,
and
sodium–glucose
cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. Study quality was assessed,
data were extracted, and results were summarized qualitatively
on the basis of the totality of evidence identified by using several
databases. Evaluated outcomes included intermediate out-
comes of hemoglobin A1c, weight, systolic blood pressure, and
heart rate; all-cause mortality; cardiovascular and cerebrovascu-
lar morbidity and mortality; retinopathy, nephropathy, and neu-
ropathy; and harms. This guideline grades the recommenda-
tions by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.
Target Audience and Patient Population: The target audi-
ence for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target pa-
tient population includes adults with type 2 diabetes.
Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clinicians pre-
scribe metformin to patients with type 2 diabetes when pharma-
cologic therapy is needed to improve glycemic control. (Grade:
strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence)
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clinicians consider
adding either a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, an SGLT-2 in-
hibitor, or a DPP-4 inhibitor to metformin to improve glycemic
control when a second oral therapy is considered. (Grade: weak
recommendation;
moderate-quality
evidence.)
ACP
recom-
mends that clinicians and patients select among medications af-
ter discussing benefits, adverse effects, and costs.

iabetes mellitus is the seventh leading cause of
death in the United States. It also is a leading
cause of morbidity, resulting in both microvascular (ret-
inopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) and macro-
vascular (coronary artery, cerebrovascular, and periph-
eral vascular disease) complications. Type 2 diabetes
mellitus is the most common form of the disease (af-
fecting 90% to 95% of persons with diabetes), with a
prevalence of approximately 29.1 million people in the
United States (1). The risk for type 2 diabetes increases
with age, and nearly 26% of people in the United States
older than 65 years have diabetes (1). In addition, be-
cause of the rising obesity rate in the United States, the
incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus are in-
creasing substantially (2). The total direct and indirect
costs associated with diabetes in the United States
alone reached $245 billion in 2012 (1).
Management of type 2 diabetes often includes life-
style modification and pharmacologic therapy. In the
United States, several unique classes of drugs are ap-
proved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) to treat hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, all of
which vary regarding cost and harms. Most adults diag-
nosed with type 2 diabetes receive treatment with oral
medications only rather than injection medications,
such as insulin or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) re-
ceptor agonists (3).
GUIDELINE FOCUS AND TARGET POPULATION
Since the publication of the 2012 American Col-
lege of Physicians (ACP) guideline on the comparative
effectiveness and safety of oral medications for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes, several new studies eval-
uated medications for this disease, and the FDA ap-

 proved several new agents. New information in the up-
dated review includes evidence on the FDA-approved
sodium–glucose
cotransporter-2
(SGLT-2)
inhibitor
class of drugs and on additional dipeptidyl peptidase-4
(DPP-4) inhibitors, as well as further evidence on other
drugs included in the 2011 review. The purpose of this
ACP guideline is to present the updated evidence re-
garding the oral pharmacologic treatment of type 2 di-
abetes; it replaces the 2012 ACP guideline on the same
topic (4). The target audience for this guideline in-
cludes all clinicians, and the target patient population
includes all adults with type 2 diabetes. These recom-
mendations are based on a systematic evidence review
sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) (5) as well as a recently published up-
date of the review (6). Although the focus of this guide-
line is oral pharmacologic therapy, lifestyle modifica-
tions are an important management strategy for type 2
diabetes. Injectable medications, including insulin, also
are important treatments, although most patients pre-
fer oral agents as initial therapy. This guideline is en-
dorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.
METHODS
Systematic Review of the Evidence
The evidence review was conducted by the AHRQ
Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center. Addi-
tional methodological details can be found in the
Appendix (available at Annals.org), the full report (5),
and the published article (6). Reviewers searched sev-
eral databases for studies published in English from
April 2009 through March 2015. An updated search
through December 2015 found evidence that changed
from low or insufficient quality to high or moderate
quality. Reviewers combined data when possible by us-
ing meta-analysis and assessed risk of bias and study
quality according to established methodology. The
study population included adults (aged ≥18 years) with
type 2 diabetes.
The review evaluated head-to-head comparisons
of oral monotherapy with metformin, thiazolidinedio-
nes, sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT-2 inhibi-
tors; comparisons of metformin monotherapy with a
metformin-based combination; and comparisons of
metformin-based combinations in which the second
medication was one of the monotherapies described
earlier. The review contains additional information on
injectables, including GLP-1 receptor agonists and in-
sulin, which is not considered in the guideline. Evalu-
ated outcomes included intermediate outcomes of he-
moglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, weight, systolic blood
pressure (for SGLT-2 inhibitors only), and heart rate (for
SGLT-2 inhibitors only); all-cause mortality; cardiovas-
cular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality; ret-
inopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy; and harms.
Grading the Evidence and Developing
Recommendations
This guideline was developed by the ACP Clinical
Guidelines
Committee
(CGC)
according
to
ACP's
guideline development process, details of which can
be found in the methods paper (7). This guideline rates
the evidence and recommendations by using ACP's
guideline grading system (Table 1).
Peer Review
The AHRQ evidence review was sent to invited
peer reviewers and posted on the AHRQ Web site
for public comments, and the published review article
was peer reviewed through the journal. The guideline
was peer reviewed through the journal and posted on-
line for comments from ACP Regents and Governors,
who represent physician members at the regional level.
COMPARATIVE BENEFITS OF ORAL
MEDICATIONS FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES
Long-Term All-Cause Mortality, Microvascular,
and Macrovascular Outcomes
Evidence from new studies (52 randomized, con-
trolled trials and 13 observational studies, mostly 1 year
or less in duration) was either low quality or insufficient
for evaluating clinical outcomes, such as mortality, car-
diovascular mortality and morbidity, retinopathy, ne-
phropathy, and neuropathy.
All-Cause Mortality
Low-quality evidence comparing metformin mono-
therapy with sulfonylurea monotherapy showed that
metformin was associated with lower all-cause mortal-
ity; however, results were inconsistent across studies
(8–16). Generally, if low-quality evidence was available
for all-cause mortality, it showed no difference between
monotherapies and combination therapies.
Cardiovascular Mortality
The review found moderate-quality evidence that
metformin was associated with lower cardiovascular
mortality (≥2 years) than sulfonylureas, on the basis of 2
randomized, controlled trials (8, 9) and 3 nonexperi-
mental studies (10, 11, 17). The CGC reviewed the in-
dividual studies and found the 2 trials to be underpow-
ered, with no significant reductions in cardiovascular
mortality with metformin versus sulfonylureas, and
therefore considered the quality of evidence to be low.

 The committee also noted that in 2 of the nonexperi-
mental studies, the combination of metformin and a
sulfonylurea significantly reduced overall (9) and car-
diovascular (16) mortality compared with a sulfonylurea
alone.
Evidence for all other comparisons was insufficient
or low quality.
Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Morbidity
Low-quality
evidence
showed
that
metformin
monotherapy was associated with lower cardiovascular
morbidity than sulfonylurea monotherapy, although re-
sults were inconsistent across studies (8–16). Evidence
for all other comparisons was insufficient or low quality,
thus inconclusive for this outcome.
Retinopathy, Nephropathy, and Neuropathy
All randomized, controlled trials were short term,
and evidence for all comparisons was insufficient or low
quality, thus inconclusive for these outcomes.
Intermediate Outcomes
HbA1c Levels
Monotherapy Versus Monotherapy. As in the 2012
guideline, most diabetes medications had similar effi-
cacy in reducing HbA1c levels. High-quality evidence
from the 2011 review showed no difference between
metformin and sulfonylureas regarding their effect on
HbA1c levels (hence, evidence was not updated) (18).
High-quality evidence also showed no difference be-
tween metformin and thiazolidinediones (19–41) or be-
tween thiazolidinediones and sulfonylureas in reducing
HbA1c levels (32, 35, 40–52). High-quality evidence
showed that metformin reduced HbA1c levels to a
greater extent than DPP-4 inhibitors (mean between-
group difference, �0.43% [CI, �0.55% to �0.31%]) (37,
53–60), and moderate-quality evidence favored sulfo-
nylureas over DPP-4 inhibitors (mean between-group
difference, �0.21% [CI, �0.32% to �0.09%]) (61–63).
Low-quality evidence showed no difference between
metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors (64–66).
Monotherapy Versus Combination Therapy. High-
quality evidence showed that all combination therapies
that included metformin were superior to metformin
monotherapy in reducing HbA1c levels (thiazolidinedio-
nes: pooled between-group difference in HbA1c for
baseline HbA1c >8%, 0.88% [CI, 0.73% to 1.04%], and
for baseline HbA1c <8%, 0.43% [CI, 0.23% to 0.63%];
sulfonylureas: 0.94% [CI, 0.68% to 1.19%]; DPP-4 inhib-
itors: 0.65% [CI, 0.60% to 0.70%]; SGLT-2 inhibitors:
0.61% [CI, 0.52% to 0.71%]) (5, 6).
Combination Therapy Versus Combination The-
rapy. Moderate-quality evidence showed that the com-
bination of metformin plus an SGLT-2 inhibitor was su-
perior to metformin plus a DPP-4 inhibitor (pooled
between-group difference in HbA1c, 0.17% [CI, 0.08%
to 0.26%]) (67–70) and to metformin plus a sulfonylurea
(pooled between-group difference in HbA1c, 0.17% [CI,
0.10% to 0.20%]) (71–75). Moderate-quality evidence
showed that metformin plus a thiazolidinedione was su-
perior to metformin plus a DPP-4 inhibitor (pooled
between-group
difference
in
HbA1c,
�0.12%
[CI,
�0.21% to �0.02%]) (63, 76–79). Moderate-quality ev-
idence showed no difference between metformin plus
a thiazolidinedione and metformin plus a sulfonylurea
(80–87).
Moderate-quality
evidence
also
showed
no
substantial
differences
regarding
most
other
comparisons.
Weight
Monotherapy Versus Monotherapy.
According to
high-quality evidence from the 2011 review, metformin
reduced weight more than thiazolidinediones (pooled
mean between-group difference, �2.6 kg [CI, �4.1 to
�1.2 kg]) or sulfonylureas (pooled mean between-
group difference, �2.7 kg [CI, �3.5 to �1.9 kg])
(hence, evidence was not updated) (18). High-quality
evidence also showed that metformin was more favor-
able than DPP-4 inhibitors for weight reduction (pooled
mean between-group difference, �1.3 kg [CI, �1.6 to
�1.0
kg])
(37,
53–60).
Moderate-quality
evidence
showed that SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced weight more
than metformin (range of between-group differences,
�1.3 to �1.4 kg) (64, 66) or DPP-4 inhibitors (between-
group difference, �2.5 to �2.7 kg) (88) and that DPP-4
inhibitors reduced weight more than thiazolidinediones
(range of between-group differences, �2.3 to �2.5 kg)
(37, 89). High-quality evidence showed that sulfonyl-
ureas caused less weight gain than thiazolidinediones
(pooled mean between-group difference, 1.2 kg [CI,
0.6 to 1.8 kg]) (35, 41, 43, 44, 50, 52, 90). Moderate-
quality evidence indicated that DPP-4 inhibitors were
favored over sulfonylureas (range of between-group
differences, 0.7 to 1.8 kg) (61–63).
Monotherapy Versus Combination Therapy. High-
quality evidence showed that metformin monotherapy
reduced weight more than metformin plus a thiazoli-
dinedione (pooled between-group difference, �2.2 kg
[CI, �2.6 to �1.9 kg]) (26, 36, 63, 91–93) or metformin
plus a sulfonylurea (pooled between-group difference,
�2.2 kg [CI, �3.4 to �1.0 kg]) (94–103). High-quality
evidence showed no difference in mean weight be-
tween metformin monotherapy and metformin plus a
DPP-4 inhibitor (53, 56, 57, 59, 63, 67, 69, 103–115).
Metformin plus an SGLT-2 inhibitor was superior to
metformin monotherapy for weight reduction (high-
quality evidence; pooled between-group difference,
2.0 kg [CI, 1.5 to 2.5 kg]) (64, 67, 69, 116, 117).
Combination Therapy Versus Combination The-
rapy. The combination of metformin plus a DPP-4 in-
hibitor was superior for weight reduction compared
with metformin plus a thiazolidinedione (moderate-
quality evidence; pooled mean between-group differ-
ence, 2.7 kg [CI, 0.8 to 4.5 kg]) (63, 76–78) and com-
pared with metformin plus a sulfonylurea (high-quality
evidence; pooled mean between-group difference, 2.2
kg [CI, 1.8 to 2.5 kg]) (103, 118–121). High-quality evi-
dence showed that the combination of metformin plus
an SGLT-2 inhibitor was superior to metformin plus a
sulfonylurea (pooled mean between-group difference,
4.7 kg [CI, 4.4 to 5.0 kg]) (72–74).

 Systolic Blood Pressure and Heart Rate
Monotherapy Versus Monotherapy. Moderate-qua-
lity evidence showed that SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced
systolic blood pressure more than metformin (pooled
between-group difference, 2.8 mm Hg [CI, 2.6 to 3.0
mm Hg]) (64, 65). The evidence was insufficient to draw
conclusions regarding the effects on heart rate of any
monotherapy comparisons.
Monotherapy Versus Combination Therapy. High-
quality
evidence
showed
that
metformin
plus
an
SGLT-2 inhibitor reduced systolic blood pressure more
than metformin alone (pooled between-group differ-
ence, 4.4 mm Hg [CI, 2.9 to 6.0 mm Hg]) (64, 67–69,
111, 116, 117, 122–124).
The evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions
regarding the effects on heart rate of any metformin
combination therapy compared with metformin alone.
Combination Therapy Versus Combination The-
rapy.
The combination of metformin and an SGLT-2
inhibitor reduced systolic blood pressure more than
that of metformin and a sulfonylurea (high-quality evi-
dence; pooled between-group difference, 5.1 mm Hg
[CI, 4.2 to 6.0 mm Hg]) (74, 75, 114) or metformin and a
DPP-4 inhibitor (moderate-quality evidence; pooled
between-group difference, 4.1 mm Hg [CI, 3.6 to 4.6
mm Hg]) (67–70).
Moderate-quality evidence indicated that the com-
bination of metformin and an SGLT-2 inhibitor in-
creased heart rate less than metformin plus a sulfonyl-
urea (pooled between-group difference, 1.5 beats/min
[CI, 0.6 to 2.3 beats/min]) (72–74).
COMPARATIVE HARMS OF ORAL MEDICATIONS
FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES
Hypoglycemia
Moderate-quality evidence showed that metformin
monotherapy was associated with a lower risk for mild,
moderate, or total hypoglycemia than metformin plus a
sulfonylurea (94, 95, 97, 101–103, 125–128). Moderate-
quality evidence also showed that monotherapy with
either metformin (37) or a thiazolidinedione (9, 43) was
associated with a lower risk for severe hypoglycemia
than sulfonylureas. Moderate-quality evidence also
showed that monotherapy with a DPP-4 inhibitor (61–
63, 129) was associated with a lower risk for mild, mod-
erate, or total hypoglycemia than sulfonylureas.
The combination of metformin and a DPP-4 inhibi-
tor was associated with a lower risk for severe hypogly-
cemia than metformin plus a sulfonylurea (high-quality
evidence) (118–120, 130–133). Moderate-quality evi-
dence showed that metformin plus an SGLT-2 inhibitor
was associated with a lower risk for severe hypoglyce-
mia than metformin plus a sulfonylurea (74, 75, 114).
Gastrointestinal Side Effects
High-quality evidence showed no difference be-
tween thiazolidinediones and sulfonylureas for gastro-
intestinal side effects (9, 41, 43, 44, 134). Moderate-
quality evidence indicated no difference between met-
formin plus a thiazolidinedione and metformin plus a
sulfonylurea (82–85, 87).
Genital Mycotic Infections
The SGLT-2 inhibitors, used alone or combined
with metformin, increased the risk for genital mycotic
infections compared with all other monotherapies or
combination therapies. Metformin was associated with
fewer genital mycotic infections than SGLT-2 inhibitors
(moderate-quality evidence) (64, 65).
High-quality
evidence
showed
that
metformin
monotherapy was associated with a lower risk for gen-
ital mycotic infections than metformin plus an SGLT-2
inhibitor (64, 67, 68, 116, 117, 122, 135, 136). The com-
bination of metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor was asso-
ciated with a lower risk for genital mycotic infections
than metformin plus an SGLT-2 inhibitor (moderate-
quality
evidence)
(66–70).
High-quality
evidence
showed that metformin plus a sulfonylurea was associ-
ated with a lower risk for genital mycotic infections
than metformin plus an SGLT-2 inhibitor (71, 74, 75,
114).
MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS
Patients with multiple chronic conditions often
were excluded from the studies included in the system-
atic review.
SUMMARY
Although all oral diabetes medications reduced
HbA1c levels, the DPP-4 inhibitors were inferior to met-
formin and sulfonylureas for this outcome. Metformin
had a greater benefit on weight than all agents except
the SGLT-2 inhibitors, and SGLT-2 inhibitors were more
effective than metformin in reducing blood pressure.
Combination therapies with metformin and an SGLT-2
or a DPP-4 inhibitor were superior to metformin alone
in reducing HbA1c levels, weight, and blood pressure.
Head-to-head comparisons of various combination
therapies showed that metformin plus an SGLT-2 inhib-
itor was superior to metformin plus a DPP-4 inhibitor or
metformin plus a sulfonylurea in reducing HbA1c levels,
although the CGC felt that these differences were of
dubious clinical importance. Metformin monotherapy
was associated with a low risk for hypoglycemia com-
pared with other monotherapies. Evidence showed that
sulfonylureas increased the risk for hypoglycemia, thia-
zolidinediones for congestive heart failure, and SGLT-2
inhibitors for genital mycotic infections. Thiazolidin-
ediones and sulfonylureas were associated with weight
gain when compared with metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors,
and SGLT-2 inhibitors.
The CGC generally agreed with the evidence re-
view that all evidence from comparisons of monothera-
pies and combination therapies with respect to overall
and cardiovascular mortality, as well as cardiovascular
morbidity, was of low quality. However, the committee
felt that the evidence showing greater cardiovascular
mortality with sulfonylureas than metformin mono-

Summary of the American College of Physicians Guideline on Oral Medications for Type 2 Diabetes
Disease/Condition
Type 2 diabetes
Target Audience
Internists, family physicians, other clinicians
Target Patient Population
Adults with type 2 diabetes
Interventions Evaluated 
Oral pharmacologic treatments: metformin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors
Outcomes Evaluated
Clinical outcomes: all-cause mortality, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy
Intermediate outcomes: HbA1c; weight; systolic blood pressure; harms: hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal side effects, genital mycotic infections
Benefits 
Clinical Outcomes
   Metformin monotherapy was associated with a lower risk for cardiovascular mortality than sulfonylurea monotherapy.
HbA1C
   Most drugs reduced HbA1C to similar levels.
   DPP-4 inhibitors reduced HbA1C levels less than metformin or sulfonylureas.
   All combination therapies with metformin were superior to metformin monotherapy.
Weight
   Metformin was better than thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, or DPP-4 inhibitors for weight.
   Combinations of metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitor agonists reduced weight more than metformin monotherapy.
   Thiazolidinediones and sulfonylureas, either alone or in combination therapy, were associated with worse weight outcomes.
Systolic Blood Pressure
   SGLT-2 inhibitors, as monotherapy or combined with metformin, reduced systolic blood pressure compared with metformin monotherapy.
Harms 
Metformin: increased risk for gastrointestinal side effects
Sulfonylureas: increased risk for hypoglycemia compared with other drugs
Thiazolidinediones: increased risk for heart failure
SGLT-2 inhibitors: increased genital mycotic infections
Recommendations
Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clinicians prescribe metformin to patients with type 2 diabetes when pharmacologic therapy is 
needed to improve glycemic control. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence)
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clinicians consider adding a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, an SGLT-2 inhibitor, or a 
DPP-4 inhibitor to metformin to improve glycemic control when a second oral therapy is considered. (Grade: weak recommendation; 
moderate-quality evidence.) ACP recommends that clinicians and patients select among medications after discussing benefits, adverse 
effects, and costs.
Clinical Considerations
Nonpharmacologic therapy includes dietary modifications, regular exercise, lifestyle modifications, and weight loss.
Management of type 2 diabetes often involves pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies and includes patient education, 
evaluation, patient self-management for microvascular and macrovascular complications, treatment of hyperglycemia, and 
minimization of cardiovascular and other long-term risk factors.
Initiation of pharmacologic therapy is an important approach for the effective management of type 2 diabetes when weight loss
or lifestyle modification fails.
Metformin monotherapy effectively decreases glycemic levels when used in monotherapy and combination therapy with a 
second agent. Metformin also reduces body weight.
Although combination therapy reduces HbA1c levels more effectively than monotherapy, it is associated with more adverse events.
The DPP-4 inhibitors saxagliptin and alogliptin may increase the risk for heart failure, especially in patients who already have 
heart or kidney disease.
Metformin is considered safe for patients with mild chronic kidney disease and some patients with moderate kidney impairment 
(but is contraindicated in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2).
DPP-4 = dipeptidyl peptidase-4; HbA1c = hemoglobin A1c; SGLT-2 = sodium–glucose cotransporter-2.

 therapy was of low rather than moderate quality. The
committee also noted that the comparisons between
metformin and metformin plus a sulfonylurea did not
suggest greater cardiovascular mortality as the result of
adding a sulfonylurea to metformin.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1: ACP recommends that clini-
cians prescribe metformin to patients with type 2 diabe-
tes when pharmacologic therapy is needed to improve
glycemic
control.
(Grade:
strong
recommendation;
moderate-quality evidence)
Metformin is effective in reducing glycemic levels,
is associated with weight loss and fewer hypoglycemic
episodes, and is cheaper than most other pharmaco-
logic agents. Although the evidence was considered
low quality, metformin may have an advantage over sul-
fonylurea monotherapy in terms of cardiovascular mor-
tality. Therefore, unless contraindicated, metformin is
the drug of choice for patients with type 2 diabetes, in
addition to lifestyle modification.
As defined by the FDA, metformin is contraindi-
cated in patients with decreased tissue perfusion or he-
modynamic instability, advanced liver disease, alcohol
abuse, acute unstable congestive heart failure, or any

 condition that might lead to lactic acidosis. However,
the FDA recently concluded that metformin is safe in
patients with mild kidney impairment and in some pa-
tients with moderate kidney impairment (but is contra-
indicated in those with an estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) (137).
Recommendation 2: ACP recommends that clini-
cians consider adding a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedi-
one, an SGLT-2 inhibitor, or a DPP-4 inhibitor to met-
formin to improve glycemic control when a second oral
therapy is considered. (Grade: weak recommendation;
moderate-quality evidence.) ACP recommends that cli-
nicians and patients select among medications after dis-
cussing benefits, adverse effects, and costs.
Combination therapies with metformin were more
effective than metformin monotherapy in reducing
HbA1c levels, weight, and blood pressure in patients
with type 2 diabetes. This recommendation is graded
as weak because of the fine balance between benefits
and harms for the various drug combinations. See Ta-
ble 2 for a summary of the comparative benefits and
harms of metformin combination therapies as well as
the adverse effects and cost of each medication. The
evidence review did not include therapies combining
more than 2 agents. Combination therapies also were
associated with an increased risk for adverse effects
compared with monotherapy.
Sulfonylureas have been used for many years and
are the least expensive oral agent to add to metformin.
However, sulfonylureas, both alone and combined with
other agents, are associated with an increased risk for
mild, moderate, or severe hypoglycemia as well as
weight gain. The evidence review did not address med-
ication switching for patients currently taking sulfonyl-
ureas. Regarding patients whose glycemic levels are
adequately controlled and who do not have adverse
effects with sulfonylureas, keeping them on this drug
may be reasonable.
The SGLT-2 inhibitors are favored over sulfonyl-
ureas as an add-on to metformin therapy in terms of
cardiovascular mortality, HbA1c, weight, systolic blood
pressure, and heart rate and are favored over DPP-4
inhibitors as an add-on to metformin therapy in terms
of weight and systolic blood pressure. As an add-on to
metformin therapy, DPP-4 inhibitors are favored over
sulfonylureas for long-term all-cause mortality, long-
term cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular mor-
bidity; over pioglitazone for short-term cardiovascular
morbidity; and over sulfonylureas or thiazolidinediones
for weight.
Each class of drugs is associated with adverse ef-
fects, which are summarized in Table 2. The FDA
warned
that
the
DPP-4
inhibitors
saxagliptin
and
alogliptin may increase the risk for heart failure, espe-
cially in patients who already have heart or kidney dis-
ease (138). The SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with
an increased risk for genital mycotic infections. Sulfo-
nylureas are associated with an increased risk for
hypoglycemia.
Although this guideline addresses only oral phar-
macologic therapy, patients with persistent hyperglyce-
mia despite oral agents and lifestyle interventions may
need insulin therapy.
HIGH-VALUE CARE
Oral pharmacologic therapy with metformin (un-
less contraindicated) is an effective management strat-
egy. It is cheaper and more effective than most other
pharmacologic agents and is associated with fewer ad-
verse effects; of note, it does not result in weight gain.
Adding a second agent to metformin may provide ad-
ditional benefits; however, the increased cost may not
always support the added benefit, particularly for the
more expensive, newer medications.
INSUFFICIENT AREAS OF EVIDENCE
Insufficient evidence exists for clinical outcomes, in-
cluding mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and micro-
or macrovascular outcomes, for most drugs and drug
comparisons. The evidence review did not address
whether patients who are already taking sulfonylureas
and have stable HbA1c levels should switch to another
medication. No data exist regarding the best time to
add oral therapies to lifestyle modifications.

APPENDIX: METHODS
Key Questions Addressed
Key Question 1
a. In adults aged 18 years or older with type 2 dia-
betes mellitus, what is the comparative effectiveness of
the specified monotherapy FDA-approved diabetes
medications for the intermediate outcomes of HbA1c,
weight, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate?
b. In adults aged 18 years or older with type 2 di-
abetes mellitus, what is the comparative effectiveness
of the specified metformin-based combinations of
FDA-approved diabetes medications for the intermedi-
ate outcomes of HbA1c, weight, systolic blood pres-
sure, and heart rate?
Key Question 2
a. In adults aged 18 years or older with type 2 dia-
betes mellitus, what is the comparative effectiveness of
the specified monotherapy FDA-approved diabetes
medications for the long-term clinical outcomes of all-
cause mortality, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
morbidity and mortality, retinopathy, nephropathy, and
neuropathy?
b. In adults aged 18 years or older with type 2 di-
abetes mellitus, what is the comparative effectiveness
of the specified metformin-based combinations of
FDA-approved diabetes medications for the long-term
clinical outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular
and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, retinopa-
thy, nephropathy, and neuropathy?
Key Question 3
a. In adults aged 18 years or older with type 2 dia-
betes mellitus, what is the comparative safety of the
specified monotherapy FDA-approved diabetes medi-
cations regarding liver injury, lactic acidosis, pancreati-
tis, hypoglycemia, congestive heart failure, cancer, se-
vere allergic reactions, macular edema or decreased
vision, and gastrointestinal side effects; for compari-
sons including SGLT-2 inhibitors, what is the compara-
tive safety regarding urinary tract infections, impaired
renal function, genital mycotic infections, fracture, and
volume depletion?
b. In adults aged 18 years or older with type 2 di-
abetes mellitus, what is the comparative safety of the
specified
metformin-based
combinations
of
FDA-
approved diabetes medications regarding liver injury,
lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, hypoglycemia, congestive
heart failure, cancer, severe allergic reactions, macular
edema or decreased vision, and gastrointestinal side
effects; for comparisons including SGLT-2 inhibitors,
what is the comparative safety regarding urinary tract
infections, impaired renal function, genital mycotic in-
fections, fracture, and volume depletion?
Key Question 4
Do the comparative safety and effectiveness of
these treatments differ across subgroups defined by
the age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index of
adults with type 2 diabetes?
Search Strategy
To update the 2011 systematic review (18), the re-
viewers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Co-
chrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for English-
language studies published from April 2009 through
March 2015 and updated through December 2015.
Studies were limited to randomized, controlled trials for
key question 1; high-quality observational studies also
were considered for key questions 2 and 3.
Meta-analysis
The reviewers conducted a meta-analysis when
data were sufficient and studies were sufficiently homo-
geneous with respect to study population characteris-
tics, study duration, and medication dosing.
Quality Assessment
The reviewers used the Jadad criteria (139) to as-
sess risk of bias in randomized, controlled trials and the
Downs and Black tool (140) to assess nonrandomized
trials and observational studies.
Population Studied
The study population included adults with type 2
diabetes, non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or
adult-onset diabetes.

 Interventions Evaluated
Evaluated pharmacologic interventions included
metformin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, DPP-4 in-
hibitors, and SGLT-2 inhibitors. Although the GLP-1 re-
ceptor agonists were not evaluated in the guideline,
they were included in the full evidence review (5).
Comparators
Monotherapies were compared with one another,
metformin was compared with combination therapies
including metformin, and metformin-based combina-
tion therapies were compared with one another.
Outcomes
Outcomes evaluated included all-cause mortality,
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mor-
tality, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, HbA1c,
weight, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and harms.
Timing
In the studies evaluated, oral pharmacologic inter-
ventions were used for more than 3 months.
Setting
The setting was outpatient as well as inpatient.
Target Audience
The target audience for this guideline includes all
clinicians.
Target Patient Population
The target patient population includes all adults
with type 2 diabetes.
Peer Review
The AHRQ evidence review was sent to invited
peer reviewers and posted on the AHRQ Web site for
public comments, and the published review article was
peer reviewed through the journal. The guideline
was peer reviewed through the journal and posted on-
line for comments from ACP Regents and ACP Gover-
nors, who represent physician members at the regional
level.

CVD = cardiovascular disease; DPP-4 = dipeptidyl peptidase-4; HR = hazard ratio; MI = myocardial infarction; OR = odds ratio; RCT = randomized,
controlled trial; RR = relative risk; SGLT-2 = sodium–glucose cotransporter-2; SU = sulfonylurea; TZD = thiazolidinedione.
* Only comparisons that were evaluated by at least 1 randomized controlled trial are listed. All other comparisons were considered to have
insufficient evidence due to a lack of available evidence. Unless otherwise specified, conclusions for the clinical outcomes are short term (1 y or
shorter), because few longer-duration studies evaluated this outcome.
† Unless otherwise specified, the estimates are the pooled mean between-group differences (95% CIs).
‡ Effect is not statistically significant.
§ Grade given by the evidence reviewers. The Clinical Guidelines Committee reviewed the individual studies and found the 2 trials to be under-
powered, with no significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality with metformin versus sulfonylureas, and therefore considered the quality of
evidence to be low.
