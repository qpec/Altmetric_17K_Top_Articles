Most human pre-implantation embryos are mosaics of euploid and aneuploid cells. To
determine the fate of aneuploid cells and the developmental potential of mosaic embryos,
here we generate a mouse model of chromosome mosaicism. By treating embryos with a
spindle assembly checkpoint inhibitor during the four- to eight-cell division, we efficiently
generate aneuploid cells, resulting in embryo death during peri-implantation development.
Live-embryo imaging and single-cell tracking in chimeric embryos, containing aneuploid and
euploid cells, reveal that the fate of aneuploid cells depends on lineage: aneuploid cells in the
fetal lineage are eliminated by apoptosis, whereas those in the placental lineage show severe
proliferative defects. Overall, the proportion of aneuploid cells is progressively depleted from
the blastocyst stage onwards. Finally, we show that mosaic embryos have full developmental
potential, provided they contain sufficient euploid cells, a finding of significance for the
assessment of embryo vitality in the clinic.

 T
he majority of human pre-implantation embryos display
chromosome
mosaicism,
with
the
most
common
pattern being euploid–aneuploid mosaicism where the
embryo contains a complement of both normal and abnormal
cells1. This mosaicism arises due to an error in mitosis during
the first few cleavage divisions following fertilization and is
believed to be directly responsible for the high rates of early
human pregnancy failure in both spontaneous conceptions2 and
following in vitro fertilization (IVF)3–6. Despite the high
incidence of mosaicism in human pre-implantation embryos,
the fate of aneuploid cells in the embryo is not clear and
many studies in human embryos rely on morphological features
to assess embryo development. Chromosome mosaicism is
most frequently observed in embryos at the early cleavage
stages, declining in prevalence as gestation progresses1,7. Whether
this shift results from developmental failure of the whole embryo
or alternatively through elimination of abnormal cells remains
currently unknown. Observational findings comparing mosaicism
levels with IVF outcomes suggest that some mosaic embryos can
develop into viable pregnancies8,9. If indeed some mosaic
embryos have full developmental potential, it is important to
understand what confers their viability.
By using a mouse model for chromosome mosaicism, it is
possible to use methodological strategies that are not possible in
human embryos. At the morphological level, mouse pre-implanta-
tion development is similar to that in humans, undergoing cleavage
divisions, compaction, blastocyst cavity formation and hatching,
albeit with slightly different timings10–12. Both mouse and human
pre-implantation development culminates in the formation of a
blastocyst that is composed of the extra-embryonic trophectoderm
(TE) and primitive endoderm (PE), which will form the placenta
and yolk sac, respectively, and the embryonic epiblast (EPI), which
forms the fetus12,13. These cell lineages are specified in two cell fate
decisions. In the first cell fate decision, cells on the outside of the
embryo form the TE, whereas cells on the inside form the
pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM). In the second cell fate decision,
cells of the ICM are segregated into the PE and the EPI. The
correct specification of these lineages and the formation of a
blastocyst able to implant are essential for all subsequent
development13. Here we have generated a mouse model of
pre-implantation chromosome mosaicism and have investigated
both
the
developmental
fate
of
aneuploid
cells
and
the
consequences of mosaic aneuploidy for successful development
of the whole embryo. By determining the development of mosaic
embryos at single-cell resolution, we show that aneuploid cells
become
eliminated
from
the
embryo,
starting
just
before
implantation, and that mosaic euploid–aneuploid embryos have
comparable developmental potential to normal embryos, provided
they contain a sufficient proportion of euploid cells.
Results
Induction of aneuploidy in early mouse embryos. To induce
chromosome segregation errors in early pre-implantation mouse
embryos (Fig. 1a) we treated embryos with reversine14, a small
molecule inhibitor of Monopolar spindle 1-like 1 kinase, to
inactivate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). The effects of
reversine are reversible following removal of the drug14; therefore,
the embryos were treated with 0.5 mM reversine during the four- to
eight-cell division, before being cultured in inhibitor-free medium
until the mature blastocyst stage (E4.5). We found that this
treatment had no effect on blastocyst formation, with a comparable
percentage of reversine-treated embryos (93%, n ¼ 30) and
controls (92%, n ¼ 36) developing into morphologically normal
blastocysts. To confirm that the SAC was inactivated by reversine
treatment, we co-incubated embryos with 0.33mM nocadazole
during the four- to eight-cell stage transition. All control embryos
underwent prolonged arrest before their blastomeres eventually
fragmented,
with
none
dividing
to
the
eight-cell
stage
(Supplementary Table 1, n ¼ 22). In contrast, 13 out of 26
embryos (50%) treated with 0.5 mM reversine were able to divide to
the eight-cell stage and this increased to 17 out of 26 embryos
(65%) with 1.0 mM reversine. To determine the effects of reversine
treatment on chromosome segregation and the length of mitoses,
embryos expressing Histone H2B-GFP15 were treated with 0.5 mM
reversine and their development visualized by live imaging during
the 8- to 16-cell division. Major chromosome segregation errors,
such as lagging chromosomes and the formation of micronuclei,
were found to occur during mitosis in 48% of reversine-treated
blastomeres (n ¼ 81), compared with only 9.7% of control
blastomeres (n ¼ 72, Po0.001, w2-test; Fig. 1b). The length of
metaphase was also significantly shorter in reversine-treated
blastomeres
(32.2 min)
compared
with
controls
(44.4 min,
Po0.001, Mann–Whitney U-test; Fig. 1c). As expected, these
effects were reversible. Following washout of reversine from the
medium, the chromosome missegregation rate (3.1%) and length
of metaphase (47.2 min) both returned to normal levels (n ¼ 32;
Fig. 1b,c). These results demonstrate that reversine is an effective
and reversible inhibitor of the SAC in pre-implantation embryos.
We used two independent methods to confirm that 0.5 mM
reversine treatment during the four- to eight-cell stage transition
generated aneuploid cells. First, we analysed control and reversine-
treated embryos for their chromosome constitution at the early
blastocyst stage (E3.5) using fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH)16 for three randomly selected chromosomes: 2, 11 and 16.
We found that reversine-treated blastomeres (n ¼ 1,076, 43
embryos) had significantly higher rates of aneuploidy than
control blastomeres (n ¼ 1,376, 38 embryos), with abnormalities
detected in 35% of reversine-treated blastomeres compared with
17% of controls (Po0.001, w2-test; Supplementary Fig. 1). To
obtain
a
more
comprehensive,
genome-wide
view
of
the
aneuploidy induced by reversine treatment, we applied low-pass
single-cell genome sequencing to blastomeres isolated from
eight-cell stage mouse embryos (Fig. 1d and Supplementary
Data 1). Using genomic bins of 1 Mb for single-cell DNA copy
number profiling by focal sequence-read depth analysis, individual
cells from control (2 out of 37 cells) and reversine-treated (3 out of
59 cells) embryos had similarly low numbers of segmental
rearrangements. However, whole chromosome missegregations
were dramatically increased in reversine-treated cells (39 out of 59
cells, 66.1%), compared with controls (0 out of 37 cells, Po0.001,
Fisher’s test). Both approaches therefore demonstrate high levels of
aneuploidy
following
reversine
treatment,
supporting
the
application of this technique for the generation of aneuploid
blastomeres for use in a mouse model of chromosome mosaicism.
Decreased cell number in aneuploid pre-implantation embryos.
We next sought to determine the effects of reversine-induced
aneuploidy on pre-implantation development. To this end,
embryos were treated with 0.5 mM reversine during the four-
to eight-cell stage transition and cultured to either the early (E3.5)
or late (E4.5) blastocyst stage to examine the expression of
markers of the TE (Cdx2), EPI (Nanog) and PE (Sox17; Fig. 2a,b).
We found that at the early blastocyst stage there was no difference
in total cell number between reversine-treated (37.6 cells, n ¼ 20)
and control embryos (40.9 cells, n ¼ 24), and no difference in the
number of Cdx2 and Nanog-positive cells (Fig. 2a). At the
late blastocyst stage, however, the reversine-treated embryos
had significantly fewer cells (72.3 cells, n ¼ 26) than controls
(95.9 cells, n ¼ 31, Po0.001, Student’s t-test; Fig. 2b). When all
individual cell lineages were analysed, a significantly reduced

 average cell number was seen in the TE (60.0 compared with 78.2
cells, Po0.001, Student’s t-test), EPI (5.9 cells compared with 9.4
cells, Po0.001, Student’s t-test) and PE (6.4 cells compared with
8.3 cells, Po0.05, Student’s t-test) in reversine-treated embryos.
However, despite this reduction in cell number, all three lineages
were segregated normally (Fig. 2b) and embryo morphology
appeared unperturbed. To investigate whether the depleted cell
number observed in the reversine-treated embryos could be
caused by an off-target effect of reversine, we sought to inhibit the
SAC by an alternative method. To this end, we injected zygotes
with
small
interfering
RNA
(siRNA)
targeting
the
SAC
protein, Mad2 (refs 17,18). We confirmed Mad2 downregulation
and cultured embryos to the late blastocyst stage (Fig. 2c and
Supplementary Fig. 2). We found that embryos injected with
Mad2 siRNA (n ¼ 22) had a significantly depleted total cell
number, compared with embryos injected with control siRNA

 (n ¼ 20, 70.9 cells compared with 83.0 cells, Po0.05, Student’s
t-test), with a significant decrease in the number of EPI cells
(8.6 cells compared with 11.4 cells, Po0.05, Student’s t-test).
Therefore,
Mad2
siRNA-injected
embryos
had
a
similar
phenotype to that seen with reversine treatment; however, the
effect was less strong, reflecting the inefficiency of RNA
interference relative to drug treatment, leading us to use 0.5 mM
reversine treatment as a means to induce aneuploidy in all sub-
sequent experiments.
Postimplantation lethality of aneuploid embryos. Our results
demonstrated that reversine-treated embryos can establish the
first three lineages, albeit with reduced cell numbers compared
with controls; therefore, we next investigated whether these
embryos could implant successfully and give rise to pups. To this
end, we treated embryos with reversine, as before, and then
transferred them at the blastocyst stage to recipient foster
mothers, before recovering them at early postimplantation stages
(E6.5–E7.5). We found that implantation rates were significantly
higher in control embryos (71%, n ¼ 45) compared with those
treated with reversine (50%, n ¼ 40, Po0.05, w2-test; Table 1).
Importantly, the reversine-treated embryos failed to produce any
viable embryos and all implantation sites were resorbing. In
contrast, every implantation site in the control embryos contained
a viable embryo (Po0.001, Fisher’s test; Table 1). These results
indicate that despite morphologically normal pre-implantation
development, reversine treatment ultimately results in early
postimplantation lethality.
Depletion of aneuploid cells before implantation. To generate
mosaic embryos that contain both aneuploid and euploid cells, we
created aggregation chimeras at the eight-cell stage that contained
a 1:1 ratio of reversine-treated and control blastomeres (Fig. 3a).
Before chimera aggregation, one group of blastomeres was
labelled with the red fluorescent dye FM4-64 so that each clone of
cells could be identified at the start of imaging. The embryos were
imaged for 48 h from the late eight-cell stage to the mature
blastocyst stage and every cell in each embryo was tracked, using
Histone-GFP fluorescent signal to visualize individual nuclei
(n ¼ 20 embryos, 1,079 blastomeres; Fig. 3b). To ensure that any
differences in blastomere behaviour could be attributed solely to
their origin (control or reversine treated), an equal number of
embryos in which either the control blastomeres or the reversine-
treated blastomeres were labelled were tracked and used for
analysis. To reveal the origin, history, cell behaviour and ultimate
fate of each blastomere we generated cell lineage trees (Fig. 3c and
Supplementary Data 2). Although some chromosome segregation
errors
are
known
to
arise
during
normal
development,
these occurred at a very low and similar frequency in both
reversine-treated (4.0%) and control blastomeres (5.0%), again

 demonstrating the reversibility of the effects of reversine
treatment on SAC function. To take account of these errors,
blastomeres demonstrating chromosome segregation errors in the
control clone and their progeny were considered in the same
group as the reversine-treated blastomeres (abnormal clone). We
found that the average proportion of blastomeres originating
from the abnormal clone in each embryo was 53% at the early
blastocyst stage, but decreased to 47% by the mature blastocyst
stage (Po0.01, Student’s paired t-test; Fig. 3d). Detailed analyses
revealed that this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the
proportion of abnormal cells in the ICM (from 55.8 to 44.2%,
Po0.05, Student’s paired t-test), whereas the decrease in the TE
lineage was not significant (from 51.3 to 50.3%). Differences
between the contribution of abnormal cells to the TE or ICM
could not be accounted for by preferential allocation of these cells
to the TE, as there was no difference in the pattern of cell division
at the 8- to 16-cell and 16- to 32-cell transitions between
abnormal
(60%
symmetric)
and
control (61%
symmetric)
blastomeres (n ¼ 361 divisions).
To determine whether differences in cell cycle lengths or cell
cycle arrest could account for the depletion of blastomeres from
the abnormal clone of the embryo, we measured the cell cycle
lengths for all fifth and sixth cleavages at the 16- to 32-cell and
32- to 64-cell transitions (Fig. 3e). Mean cell cycle lengths were

 compared between control and abnormal clones, matched to
cleavage cycle and according to position within the embryo:
inside (ICM progenitors) or outside (TE progenitors). There
were
no
significant
differences
between
the
control
and
abnormal clones, with the exception of outside cells undergoing
the sixth cleavage. In this case, there was a small but significant
increase in the mean cell cycle length in the abnormal clone
of
blastomeres
(751 min,
n ¼ 126
cells),
compared
with
controls (681 min, n ¼ 142 cells, Po0.001, Student’s t-test). This
assessment of cell cycle lengths required the blastomeres to have
completed a minimum of two divisions during imaging, meaning
that extremely slow or senescent cells were excluded. To include
these cells in the analysis, blastomeres with unmeasurable cell
cycle lengths were assessed up until the point at which the movie
ended. All blastomeres were then categorized as either ‘standard’
or ‘slow outliers’ depending on whether their cell cycle length was
less or more than the mean cell cycle length plus two s.d.,
respectively. Blastomeres that had unmeasurable cell cycle length
but did not exceed the cutoff limit for categorization as slow
outlier were excluded, as it was not possible to determine
which category they belonged to. Using this classification
system we found that a significantly higher proportion of
blastomeres in the abnormal clone were slow outliers (13.5%)
than in the control clone (5.0%, Po0.001, w2-test; Fig. 3f). When
TE and ICM cells were analysed individually, this effect was
specific to the TE, with 9.2% of TE cells from the abnormal clone
being slow outliers, compared with only 1.4% of TE cells from the
control clone (Po0.001, w2-test). In the ICM, the difference in
proportion of slow outliers was small and not statistically
significant (5.2% and 3.6% in abnormal and control clones,
respectively). When considered together, the trend towards
slower cell cycle lengths, combined with the higher proportions
of slow outlier cells in the abnormal TE cells, could account for a
proportion of the reduction in abnormal cell number observed in
the chimeric embryos.
Apoptosis of aneuploid cells during blastocyst maturation. In
addition to differences in cell cycle lengths, a further mechanism
that may be responsible for the gradual depletion of abnormal cells
is an increased frequency of apoptosis. Apoptosis is frequently
observed within the ICM lineage during blastocyst maturation;
therefore, in addition to the 20 chimeras that were analysed from
the eight-cell stage onwards, a further 14 embryos were included
for the analysis of apoptosis, to increase the number of ICM cells
that could be assessed. These chimeras were generated using
embryos that had been injected with Tomato-RFP messenger RNA
into both blastomeres at the two-cell stage, removing the
requirement for FM4-64 labelling, and were imaged for the 24-h
period encompassing blastocyst maturation (Supplementary Data
2). We detected characteristic apoptotic morphological features19
in 30.9% of the ICM cells of chimeric embryos (n ¼ 36 embryos,
634 blastomeres). This included the disintegration of apoptotic
cells and the subsequent engulfment of the cellular debris by
neighbouring cells (Fig. 4a). We found that frequency of apoptosis
in the ICM was significantly higher in the abnormal clone of cells
(41.4%) than the control clone (19.5%, Po0.001, Fisher’s test;
Fig.
4b),
indicating
that
aneuploid
cells
are
preferentially
eliminated from the embryo. In the TE, apoptosis was much less
frequent (2.0% of cells, n ¼ 1346 blastomeres), but again the
abnormal clone showed a significantly higher frequency of
apoptosis (3.3%) than the control clone (0.6%, Po0.001, Fisher’s
test; Fig. 4b).
The higher rate of apoptosis observed within the abnormal
clones suggested that genetically abnormal cells might be
eliminated from the future fetal lineage by apoptosis. If this is
the case, it would follow that cells with the closest common
ancestry would be likely to share a common fate, either to all die
or all survive. To test this hypothesis, we next evaluated the
patterns of cell death or survival in ICM sister blastomere pairs,
which are the direct progeny of one parent blastomere and thus
more likely to share identical genetic constitutions (n ¼ 321 pairs;
Fig. 4c). We found that significantly more sister blastomere pairs
both underwent apoptosis than would be expected by chance
(13.3 versus 5.6%, Po0.001, binomial test). Furthermore, more
pairs of blastomeres both survived than would be expected if
apoptosis occurred randomly (66.0% versus 58.2%, Po0.01,
binomial test). These results provide evidence that abnormal cells
are actively eliminated from the ICM of chimeric mosaic embryos
by apoptosis during blastocyst development.
Presence of sufficient euploid cells rescues development. To
address whether the presence of normal cells within the embryo
could rescue the lethal peri-implantation phenotype of reversine-
induced aneuploidy, we next investigated the postimplantation
development of mosaic embryos. Chimeras containing a 1:1 ratio of
control and reversine-treated blastomeres were constructed at the
eight-cell stage, as before (n ¼ 115). In addition, chimeras were also
made with a 1:3 ratio of control to reversine-treated blastomeres
(n ¼ 53). The embryos were transferred to foster mothers and
recovered at early postimplantation stages (E6.5–E7.5; Table 1). We
found that both the 1:1 chimeras (64.3%, P ¼ 0.09, w2-test) and the
1:3 chimeras (47.2%, P ¼ 0.47, w2-test) had equivalent implantation
rates to control chimeras (53.3%, n ¼ 107). Strikingly, all 1:1
chimera implantation sites contained a viable, morphologically
normal embryo, as did controls (Table 1), indicating that the
addition of control blastomeres in the 1:1 chimeras was able to
rescue the reversine phenotype. In contrast, significantly fewer
of 1:3 chimera implantation sites contained a viable embryo
(44%, Po0.001, Fisher’s test; Table 1), although there was still a
partial rescue of postimplantation lethality. No evidence of
increased apoptosis was found in either control or 1:1 reversine
chimeras by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL)
staining (not shown), indicating that apoptosis is unlikely to
play a major role in eliminating abnormal cells during early
postimplantation development.
In a subset of the experiments, 1:1 reversine and control
chimeras were constructed using embryos from two different
genetic backgrounds, wild-type F1 and Histone H2B-GFP, so that
the control and reversine-treated clones could be identified in the
postimplantation embryos. The composition of these chimeras was
analysed at E6.5 and E7.5 (Fig. 5). We found that in the majority of
embryos recovered, there were dramatically fewer reversine-treated
cells than control cells; however, some reversine-treated clones
were present throughout the entire conceptus, with no evidence of
preferential depletion in the embryonic or extra-embryonic lineage.
It is possible that these clones represented reversine-treated
blastomeres that did not carry chromosomal abnormalities. There
was also no evidence of increased apoptosis or necrosis occurring
in the treated clones, as nuclear morphology appeared equivalent
between the reversine-treated and control clones, with no evidence
of nuclear debris or cellular remnants. These findings suggest that
although abnormal cells are depleted from the embryo before E6.5,
the reversine-treated clones that remain contribute to both
embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues.

Therefore, we next sought to determine whether this early

 postimplantation rescue was associated with successful further
development. To investigate this, 1:1 reversine chimeras and
equivalent control embryos were transferred into foster mothers
and recovered at E13.5 or allowed to develop to term. We found
that chimeras comprising half reversine-treated cells developed to
E13.5 with an equivalent rate (52.3%, n ¼ 58) to controls
(58.8%, n ¼ 34, P ¼ 0.53, w2-test; Table 1), with the appropriate
size and morphology expected for their gestational stage. To
evaluate whether there was any significant depletion of the
reversine-treated clone within the fetus or placenta, we also
generated chimeras from a mix of wild-type F1 and Histone
H2B-GFP embryos. On recovery of the conceptuses at E13.5,
whole-mount green fluorescent protein (GFP) images were taken
(Fig. 6a), along with fetal and placental biopsies (Fig. 6b). In
the majority of control chimeras, both clones were present in both
the fetus and placenta (88%, n ¼ 17 embryos). In the chimeras
containing reversine-treated cells, these cells were depleted or
absent from the fetus in 66% of embryos (n ¼ 9, Po0.01
compared with controls, Fisher’s test) and from the placenta in
55% of cases (n ¼ 9, Po0.01 compared with controls, Fisher’s
test). In those cases where both clones were present within the
conceptus, evaluation of the biopsies revealed that both clones
were distributed evenly and mixed, with no evidence of clonal
pooling or restrictions. There was also no evidence of enrichment
of the abnormal clone within the placental tissues.
Finally, to determine whether viability rates at E13.5 would be
consistent with live birth rates, we transferred chimeras contain-
ing 50% reversine-treated cells to recipient mothers and allowed
their development to term (n ¼ 26). A total of 13 live pups were
born, confirming that viability at E13.5 was indeed equivalent to
viability at term (P ¼ 0.77, w2-test; Table 1 and Supplementary
Fig. 3). All pups survived with no signs of ill health beyond 4
months of age (day 3 mean weight ¼ 3.31 g, s.d. ¼ 0.26 g;
Supplementary Table 2). Analyses of coat fur revealed no
evidence of the reversine-treated clone in 7 out of 13 mice, with
only 3 mice having a major contribution from both clones.
Thus, in the minority of embryos that contained progeny from
the reversine-treated clone, there was no evidence of adverse
outcome. Together, these results show that the embryonic
lethality of reversine-treated embryos can be completely rescued,
provided there are sufficient normal cells present in the embryo.
The combined E13.5 recovery and live birth rates were equivalent

Discussion
Here we generated a mouse model for euploid–aneuploid
chromosome mosaicism, to investigate both the fate of aneuploid
cells and the developmental potential of mosaic embryos.
To induce aneuploidy, we used the drug reversine to inhibit the
key SAC protein Monopolar spindle 1-like 1 kinase during
the four- to eight-cell stage transition14. Reversine treatment
successfully achieved bypass of the SAC and induced high rates of
chromosome segregation errors in treated blastomeres. In
addition, the effect of the treatment was transient and SAC
function was restored on washout of the drug, enabling the
induction of acute chromosome missegregations to be tightly
restricted and thus limited to a defined developmental window,

 similar to that believed to occur during human pre-implantation
development1. Reversine-treated embryos formed blastocysts by
E4.5, but had significantly fewer cells in all lineages, compared
with controls. We also attempted to inhibit SAC function in the
mouse embryo using siRNA targeting another SAC component,
Mad2 (ref. 17). Similar to reversine-treated embryos, Mad2
siRNA-injected embryos had a reduction in cell number at E4.5,
although this effect was smaller, most probably reflecting the
inefficiency of RNA interference relative to drug treatment.
The similarity of phenotypes suggests that the reduced cell
number is not an off-target effect of reversine, but rather
represents a true phenotype downstream of SAC inhibition.
Despite morphologically normal development to the blastocyst
stage, all reversine-treated embryos died by early postimplanta-
tion stages, reminiscent of the early postimplantation lethal
phenotype of embryos lacking essential SAC genes or kinetochore
proteins17,20–26. Embryos that lack expression of BubR1, for
example,
display
mosaic
aneuploidy,
are
lethal
at
early
postimplantation stages and exhibit high levels of apoptosis26.
These SAC knockout embryos, which are in a state of permanent
chromosome instability, have shown that SAC function is
essential for embryo development. Here, by using a reversible
inhibitor during only one early division, we have generated
aneuploid embryos that have normal SAC function following
removal of reversine from culture, and therefore chromosome
content should be stable, with the aneuploidies generated by the
reversine treatment maintained through subsequent division
cycles. This increases the likelihood that the peri-implantation
lethality of reversine-treated embryos is due to reversine-induced
aneuploidy, rather than other effects of long-term SAC inhibition
and chromosome instability.
To generate mosaic embryos in which normal and abnormal
cells could be identified, we created chimeric mouse embryos
containing a 1:1 ratio of control and reversine-treated cells. The use
of wild-type cells for the ‘normal’ part of the chimera was
considered
appropriate
as,
unlike in human
embryos,
the
prevalence of aneuploidy in mouse embryos is relatively low27–29,
which we confirmed by our single-cell genome sequencing of
control eight-cell stage embryos. To determine the fate of abnormal
cells within developing mosaic chimeras, we used high-resolution
time-lapse imaging to follow every single cell within each
embryo. Although current technology did not enable the direct
evaluation of the chromosome status in each blastomere, a
comparative approach to analysis was adopted, on the basis that
reversine-treated blastomeres with high rates of chromosome
segregation errors would be expected to exhibit greater rates of
chromosome
abnormalities
than
their
control
counterparts.
Importantly, we found that between E3.5 and E4.5 the abnormal
clone of cells was significantly depleted from the embryo, in
agreement with observations in human embryos that identified the
proportion of aneuploid cells to be lower in blastocysts than at
earlier developmental stages30–35. These data are consistent with a
‘clonal depletion’ hypothesis35,36 for the survival of mosaic
embryos,
rather
than
the
‘self-correction’
of
chromosomal
abnormalities37,38.
The application of time-lapse imaging enabled cell fate to be
evaluated directly in mosaic embryos for the first time and revealed
no evidence of preferential allocation of abnormal cells to
embryonic or extra-embryonic lineages, in agreement with studies
on human embryos3,33,34,39,40. Instead, we found that in different
lineages different mechanisms are primarily responsible for the
depletion of reversine-treated cells, with TE cells exhibiting
increased cell cycle length and senescence, and ICM cells having
an increased frequency of apoptosis. Whether this apoptotic
response in the ICM is downstream of aneuploidy-induced DNA
damage or another pathway is not yet clear; however, it is in
agreement with previous models of chromosome instability that
reported cell death within the ICM lineage, in contrast to reduced
but ongoing viability of TE cells17,20,23. The evidence we provide
here against the hypothesis that aneuploid cells are preferentially
allocated to the TE does not exclude the possibility that confined
placental mosaicism41 may arise as a consequence of pre-
implantation defects. We found that abnormal cells within the
ICM were significantly more likely to undergo apoptosis than those
within the TE. Hence, abnormal TE cells often remained viable,
albeit depleted relative to their normal counterparts. If some of
these cells continue to proliferate, contributing progeny to the
future placenta, this could result in confined placental mosaicism.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly demonstrate
the progressive depletion of aneuploid cells from the pre-
implantation embryo, and to establish that this occurs through
differential mechanisms according to cell lineage. This is also the
first study to provide direct evidence that apoptosis within the ICM
can occur as a mechanism to eliminate cells with chromosomal
abnormalities, a hypothesis frequently proposed42,43 but until now
never directly tested. To take this further and determine the
postimplantation fate of euploid–aneuploid mosaic embryos, we
transferred the experimental chimeras into foster mothers. This
revealed that when embryos contained 50% non-treated control
cells, the early postimplantation lethality that occurred in whole
reversine-treated
embryos
was
completely
rescued
and
implantation rates and viability were comparable to those in
equivalent controls. When the proportion of control blastomeres
was decreased to one third, there was a partial rescue of embryonic
lethality.
Unlike

components of the SAC, such as Mad2 (ref. 17) or BubR1

 reversine chimeras at E6.5–E7.5, again most probably because
although the chimeras contain a high proportion of abnormal cells,
the SAC is functional in these embryos.
At the early postimplantation stages of development, many 1:1
chimeric embryos still contained a small proportion of reversine-
treated progeny, but by E13.5 this was not the case in the majority
of fetuses and their placenta. It is likely to be that an ongoing
reduction in the abnormal clone relative to the control clone
occurs due to poorer proliferative capabilities of the abnormal
cells. When these 1:1 chimeras were allowed to develop to
term, live pups were born with comparable success to early
postimplantation and fetal viability rates. Together, these results
lead us to conclude that euploid–aneuploid mosaic embryos are
likely to be viable, provided there is a sufficient proportion of
normal cells within the embryo, and that viability at the early
postimplantation stage of development is predictive of survival to
fetal stages and live birth (Fig. 7). This finding may be of clinical
significance when viewed in the context of embryo biopsy
and pre-implantation genetic screening, and potentially an
explanation for why cleavage stage embryo biopsy was found to
be detrimental to IVF success rates in couples with a poor
prognosis for IVF44. It also supports the current move from
biopsy at the cleavage stage towards blastocyst biopsy, when
removal of cells has less impact on the overall constitution of the
embryo.
In conclusion, the results presented here show for the first time
that blastomeres with a history of chromosome abnormalities
become progressively depleted from the embryo as it develops.
This depletion becomes first apparent during blastocyst matura-
tion, when abnormal ICM cells have increased apoptosis and
abnormal TE cells exhibit limited proliferation. Abnormal embryos
are able to implant and elicit a maternal decidual reaction, but
undergo early postimplantation resorption. In contrast, mosaic
embryos that contain sufficient normal euploid cells have full
developmental potential.
Methods
Pre-implantation embryo culture and time-lapse imaging. Animals used for the
study were maintained at the Gurdon Institute Animal Facility, University of
Cambridge, with a 12:12 light cycle and provided with food and water ad libitum.
All experiments were performed in compliance with Home Office regulations.
Four- to six-week-old F1 (C57B16xCBA) female mice were injected with 10 IU
PMSG (Intervet) followed by 10 IU hCG (Intervet) 48 h later, to induce super-
ovulation. The females were then mated with F1 males or, where indicated, with
Histone H2B-GFP males15. Embryos were recovered into M2 medium
supplemented with 4 mg ml � 1 BSA and cultured in KSOM medium with amino
acids under mineral oil at 37 �C and 5% CO2. Reversine (Cayman Chemicals) was
dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide and control embryos were incubated in the
equivalent dimethylsulfoxide concentration. Nocodazole (Sigma) was diluted in
culture medium. Embryos for live imaging were transferred to glass-bottom dishes
(MatTek) and cultured within the individual interstices of a finely weaved nylon
mesh. Time-lapse movies were generated using a spinning disk confocal
microscopy system (3i Intelligent Imaging Innovations) and SlideBook software.
Brightfield and fluorescent images were captured in 15 Z-planes at 3.5 mm intervals
every 7–10 min. Individual cells were tracked using SimiBiocell software with the
position of each nuclei marked in every frame. Cell tracking experiments were
carried out blind to the origin of the blastomere, with identification of cell origin
revealed only on completion of tracking of the entire embryo.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization. FISH was carried out using probes for
chromosomes 2, 11 and 16. Whole embryos were spread on poly-L-lysine slides and
incubated for 20 min at 37 �C in 0.1 N HCl with 10 mg ml � 1 pepsin (Sigma). After
washes in H2O and PBS, the slides were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA),
washed with PBS and dehydrated through 70%, 90% and 100% ethanol for 3 min
each. The slides and dual-colour LSI FISH probes (Kreatech, The Netherlands)
were separately denatured at 75 �C for 5 min in 70 ml de-ionized formamide
(Sigma), 20 ml H2O and 10 ml 20 � SSC, before being washed in cold 70%
ethanol for 5 min and dehydrated through 90 and 100% ethanol for 3 min each.
The probes were applied to the air-dried slides, incubated overnight at 37 �C and

The slides were then washed twice in 4 � SSX/0.05% Tween 20 for 5 min at
room temperature, dehydrated and mounted using Vectashield (Vector Labs)
containing 4,6 diamidino-2-phenylinodole (DAPI; Sigma). The slides were
visualized using an Olympus BX40 microscope and Smartcapture II software
(Digital Scientific).
Single-cell genome sequencing. To collect individual blastomeres for single-cell
genome sequencing, the zona pellucida of eight-cell stage embryos was removed by
treatment with acidic Tyrode’s (AT) solution (Sigma) and the embryos incubated
in Ca2 þ and Mg2 þ-free M2 media for 5 min. The embryos were then dis-
aggregated into individual cells by gentle pipetting with a flame-polished glass
pipette and each cell was snap frozen in PBS. The DNA of the single blastomeres
was whole-genome amplified using PicoPlex (Rubicon Genomics). Sequencing
libraries of whole-genome amplified products were prepared following the TruSeq
or Nextera XT protocol (Illumina), which were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions with one exception: the Nextera XT protocol was
performed using half volumes. The single-cell libraries were sequenced on the
HiSeq2000 or HiSeq2500 platform and the resulting sequence reads were trimmed
for potential adaptor contamination to specific read lengths, as specified in
Supplementary Data 1, and then mapped to the mouse reference genome (mm9)
using Burrows–Wheeler Alignment. Genome-wide DNA copy number profiles
were generated using focal read-depth analysis. To this end, genomic bins of
variable size, containing 1 million uniquely mappable positions (similar to45 and46)
were defined. Specifically, we produced artificial reads of a length equal to the
single-cell reads from every base in the mm9 reference genome and mapped them
back to mm9 using Burrows–Wheeler Alignment, allowing the identification of all
uniquely mappable positions in the mm9 reference genome using reads of a specific
length. The reference genome was then divided into non-overlapping bins
comprising the fixed number of uniquely mappable positions. Per bin, a single-cell
logR value was then computed by determining the log2-base of the ratio of the
cell’s sequence read count within a given bin and the cell’s median sequence read
count of the bins genome wide. Bins with a %GC content of o28% were discarded.
LogR values were corrected for %GC bias using a Loess fit in R and further
normalized to the median logR value genome wide. Piecewise constant fitting was
used to segment the logR values (the penalty g-value was set to 15 and the kmin
value to 5) and subsequently DNA copy number was estimated as 2LogR.C with the
average ploidy (C) set to 2. Copy number analysis and statistical tests were
performed using R (version 3.0.2; http://cran.r-project.org). The single-cell
sequences had to fulfill quality criteria: a median absolute pairwise difference of the
genome-wide logR of o0.4 or a minimum amount of sequencing reads obtained.
See Supplementary Data 1.
Immunofluorescence and TUNEL staining. Embryos were treated with AT
solution to remove the zona pellucida and fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min at room
temperature. The embryos were then permeabilized for 20 min in 0.6% Triton
X-100 (Sigma), washed in PBS and incubated in blocking solution (3% BSA
(Sigma) in PBS) at 4 �C for 4 h and then with primary antibodies in blocking
solution for a minimum of 6 h at 4 �C. They were then washed and incubated with
secondary antibodies for 1 h, washed again and incubated with DAPI for 5 min.
Primary antibodies used: mouse anti-Cdx2 (1:200; BioGenex), rabbit anti-Nanog
(1:200; Abcam) and goat anti-Sox17 (1:200; R&D Systems). For TUNEL staining,
the embryos were fixed, washed and permeabilized for 30 min in 0.5% Triton-X100
on ice. The embryos were then washed in PBS/PVP (PBS containing 1 mg ml � 1
polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sigma) and incubated in 50 ml of TUNEL reaction mixture
(Sigma) in the dark for 1 h at 37 �C. Embryos were then washed through PBS/PVP
and incubated in DAPI for 5 min at room temperature before imaging. Confocal
imaging was carried out using either an Olympus FV1000 (Fluoview FV10-AW
software) or Leica SP5 (LAS AF software) inverted confocal microscope. Image
files were viewed and analysed using ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) or Fiji
(www.fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Fiji) software.
Injection of siRNA and confirmation of knockdown by qRT–PCR. Zygotes were
injected with 12 mM Mad2 (50-GAGGACAGCTTTACTATTCAA-30) or AllStars
Negative Control (Qiagen) siRNA. Embryos were collected for quantitative reverse
transcriptase–PCR (qRT–PCR) 48h later at the eight-cell stage. Total RNA was
extracted using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit and qRT–PCR was
performed using the Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Life Technologies)
and a StepOne Plus Real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). The ddCT
method was used to determine relative levels of mRNA expression, with Gapdh
as an endogenous control. Mad2 primers: 50-CTGACCCCGAGCTCATAAAGT-30,
50-ACTGAGCACTTGTACAGCCA-30 and Gapdh primers: 50-AGAGACGGCC
GCATCTTC-30, 50-CCCAATACGGC CAAATCCGT-30.
Generation of chimeric embryos and blastomere labelling. Aggregation
chimeric mosaics containing reversine-treated and control blastomeres were
created at the eight-cell stage. Individual blastomeres were obtained as described
above and carefully aggregated together in M2 containing 0.1 mg ml � 1
phytohaemagglutinin (Sigma). For live imaging from the eight-cell stage, the
blastomeres were labelled just before chimera aggregation by incubation for 10 min
in M2 containing a 1:100 dilution of FM4-64 (Invitrogen). For chimeras imaged
from the mid-blastocyst stage, half of the embryos were labelled at the two-cell
stage by microinjection of Tomato fluorescent protein mRNA into both
blastomeres.
Embryo transfers and postimplantation recovery and biopsy. Uterine transfers
to prepared females were performed at the Transgenic Facility, Stem Cell Institute,
University of Cambridge. E3.5 blastocysts were transferred into the uterine horn of
2.5 days postcoitum pseudo-pregnant F1 females that had been mated with
vasectomized males. Early postimplantation embryos (E6.5–E7.5) were dissected
from the maternal decidua and recovered into PBS on ice. Viable embryos were
fixed in 4% PFA at 4 �C for 1 h, followed by washes through PBS and incubation
with DAPI. E13.5 embryos were recovered individually into PBS on ice, keeping
each fetus and its corresponding placenta together for whole-mount images.
Placental and fetal biopsies were taken from several sites and fixed in 4% PFA
for 1 h at 4 �C. The specimens were then rinsed in PBS and incubated
sequentially in 15, 20 and 30% sucrose (Sigma) for 1 h each, followed by overnight
incubation in a 1:1 30% sucrose:OCT embedding solution (Tissue-Tek) mix at 4 �C.
The samples were then embedded in OCT media, frozen on dry ice and used
to produce 12 mm cryosections. The slides were stained with NucView DAPI
(Invitrogen) and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories). Images were taken using a Deltavision widefield microscope with
a � 20 objective.
Statistical analysis. To compare categorical data the w2-test was used, unless the
numbers were small in which case Fisher’s exact test was used. The Mann–Whitney
U-test or Kruskall–Wallis test was used to compare median timings of mitosis or
time to mitotic slippages. In all cases, the two-tailed version of the test was used to
evaluate statistical significance. Calculations were carried out in Microsoft Excel or
with GraphPad software. All graphs show mean values, error bars ¼ s.e.

Figure 7 | Effects of pre-implantation chromosome mosaicism on embryo
development and survival. Reversine-treated embryos formed blastocysts
but failed to develop past implantation. Increasing the proportion of control
blastomeres in the embryo rescued the lethal phenotype. Numbers
represent the viability of early postimplantation embryos that had
successfully implanted. Early postimplantation rescue resulted in complete
rescue of developmental potential, with E13.5 and live birth rates equivalent
to viability at E6.5–7.5.
