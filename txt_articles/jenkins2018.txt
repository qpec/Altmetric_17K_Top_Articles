ABSTRACT
The authors identified individual randomized controlled trials from previous meta-analyses and additional searches,
and then performed meta-analyses on cardiovascular disease outcomes and all-cause mortality. The authors assessed
publications from 2012, both before and including the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force review. Their systematic reviews
and meta-analyses showed generally moderate- or low-quality evidence for preventive benefits (folic acid for total
cardiovascular disease, folic acid and B-vitamins for stroke), no effect (multivitamins, vitamins C, D, b-carotene,
calcium, and selenium), or increased risk (antioxidant mixtures and niacin [with a statin] for all-cause mortality). Conclusive
evidence for the benefit of any supplement across all dietary backgrounds (including deficiency and sufficiency) was not
demonstrated; therefore, any benefits seen must be balanced against possible risks. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2018;71:2570–84)

reatment and prevention of micronutrient
deficiencies with vitamins and minerals in
the last two-and-a-half centuries are among
the most dramatic achievements in the history of
nutritional science. The treatment of scurvy with cit-
rus fruit (vitamin C) by the British Naval Surgeon James
Lind in 1747 was, perhaps, the first clinical trial ever
conducted (1), in which 12 sailors who had scurvy
were (presumably randomly) selected to receive 1 of 6
treatments (2 sailors) per treatment. However, interest
in micronutrients has shifted recently from prevention
of classic deficiency states to prevention of possible

 subclinical deficiencies and promotion
of overall
health and longevity using supplemental vitamins
and minerals (supplement use). Here, the data are
less clear, but supplement use is widespread. Using
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
data (1999 to 2012) on 37,958 adults, it was estimated
that supplement use was high in 2012, with up to 52%
of the population taking supplements. Multivitamins
were taken by 31% of the population, vitamin D by
19%, calcium by 14%, and vitamin C by 12% (2). In
Europe during this period, the European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) data
on 36,034 men and women indicated a wide range of
supplement use, with a strong north-south gradient
that was highest in the north (e.g., Denmark: 51%
men, 65.8% women) and lowest in the south (e.g.,
Greece: 2.0% men, 6.7% women), and with higher sup-
plement use by women (3). Despite high supplement
use by the general public, there is no general agree-
ment on whether individual vitamins and minerals or
their combinations should be taken as supplements
for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention or treat-
ment. Only the Canadian Cancer Society recommends
a supplement (1,000 IU vitamin D to be taken in fall
and winter) (4). What is generally recommended inter-
nationally is consumption of a good diet as part of a
healthy lifestyle. The recent science-based report of
the U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, also
concerned with CVD risk reduction, recom-
mended 3 dietary patterns: 1) a healthy Amer-
ican diet low in saturated fat, trans fat, and red
meat, but high in fruit and vegetables; 2) a
Mediterranean diet; and 3) a vegetarian diet
(5). These diets, with their accompanying rec-
ommendations, continue the move toward
more plant-based diets that are relatively rich
in vitamins and minerals, which liberally sat-
isfies requirements (Dietary Reference In-
takes) but which are still below the tolerable
upper levels of intake of the recommended
range in which adverse effects may be seen.
Thus, for the general public, the focus has
been on meeting requirements through diet,
rather than supplements.
Therefore, we reviewed the evidence for supple-
ment use over the last 4 years since the publication of
the evidence (6) and guidelines (7) for supplement use
of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).
METHODS
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis
of existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses and

 USPSTF) through October 2017 and including the
studies reviewed by the USPSTF (6,7). We performed a
search of published studies in the Cochrane Library,
MEDLINE, and PubMed, and used the search terms:
“dietary supplements or supplement*” and “cardio-
vascular disease or myocardial infarction or stroke or
cardiovascular death or mortality or all-cause mortal-
ity or death or cancer death or cancer mortality.”
Specific searches were conducted for individual sup-
plements of the vitamins and minerals in the USPSTF
report of 2013 for CVD outcomes and total mortality.
The search was limited to meta-analyses, RCTs, and
observational studies (data not reported).
Where $2 meta-analyses with forest plots on the
same topic were identified, we identified the unique
studies and excluded duplicates, studies that were not
relevant, and studies that did not provide data. Full
paper review and data extraction were conducted by 2
independent investigators, with all disagreements
reconciled through consensus. The extracted data for
RCTs included the number of cases and total partici-
pants per population for the intervention or exposed
group, and also for the control group or nonexposed
group. Data were analyzed using Review Manager
(RevMan) version 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre,
The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark),
and publication bias analysis was conducted using
STATA software, version 13.0 (StataCorp, College
Station, Texas). To obtain summary estimates, data
were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel method, with
data presented only for random effects models. Het-
erogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q statistic
at p < 0.1 and quantified by the I2 statistic. An I2
value $50% indicated substantial heterogeneity (8).
Publication bias was investigated by visual inspection
of funnel plots and quantitative assessment using
Begg’s and Egger’s tests, in which p < 0.05 was
considered evidence of small study effects (9). If <10
trials were available in a meta-analysis, publication
bias analysis was not conducted due to insufficient
power. The number needed to treat (NNT) and the
number needed to harm (NNH) were calculated by
the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR)
(NNT ¼ 1/ARR, NNH ¼ 1/ARR). The ARR equals
control cases/control total minus experimental cases/
experimental total (10).
VITAMINS AND MINERALS ASSESSED. Where both
supplements and dietary intakes of nutrients in foods
were combined as total intakes, data were not used
unless supplement data were also presented sepa-
rately. We assessed those supplements previously re-
ported on by the USPSTF: vitamins A, B1, B2, B3 (niacin),
B6, B9 (folic acid), C, D, and E, as well as b-carotene,
calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. The
term multivitamin has been used to denote the use of
supplements that include most vitamins and minerals

 (e.g., the brand, Centrum, Pfizer Inc., New York, New
York), rather than a select few. In addition, we
included B-complex vitamins (a combination of $2 of
the following: B6, B9 [folic acid], and B12) and antioxi-
dant mixtures (a combination of $2 of the following:
vitamins A, C, E, b-carotene, selenium, zinc) as com-
posite entities, because there were >10 RCTs with all-
cause mortality data for both types of supplements.
Summary plots were also undertaken as summaries of
pooled effect estimates to include all cardiovascular
outcomes, and cumulative plots were undertaken to
illustrate what was already significant or had become
significant since the USPSTF 2013 assessment.
RISK OF BIAS. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, which
is based on randomization, allocation concealment,
blinding, completeness of follow-up, and intention-
to-treat was used to assess eligible RCTs (11).
GRADING OF THE EVIDENCE. The quality and strength
of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and
Evaluation (GRADE) tool (12–24). Using the GRADE
tool, evidence was graded as high-quality, moderate-
quality, low-quality, or very low-quality evidence. By
default, RCTs were graded as high-quality evidence.
Criteria used to downgrade evidence included: study
limitations (as assessed by the Cochrane Risk of
Bias Tool), inconsistency (substantial) unexplained
by interstudy heterogeneity, I2 > 50%, and p < 0.10;
indirectness (presence of factors that limited the
generalizability of the results); imprecision (the 95%
confidence interval [CI] for effect estimates crossed a
minimally important difference of 5% [risk ratio (RR):
0.95 to 1.05] from the line of unity); and publication
bias (significant evidence of small study effects).

The search strategy used to identify publications that reported randomized control trial (RCT) data on vitamins and minerals with cardiovascular
disease (CVD), CVD components, and all-cause mortality. The publications are from 2012 to 2017 and focus on meta-analysis of RCTs and single
RCTs identified by searchingCochrane, MEDLINE, and PubMed, andby manual searches.The reasonsfor exclusion aregiven. There were 179 single
RCTs included, of which 15 were new since the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) meta-analysis. The capture rate of 113 of 1,496
at <10% indicates the general interest in this area, but a relative lack of usable data. SRMA ¼ systematic review and meta-analysis.

 Attention was drawn to outcomes of meta-analyses
that showed significance with moderate- to high-
quality evidence (with >1 RCT). In this way, we
reduced the risk of type 1 errors in the multiple
comparison undertaken and avoided the use of cor-
rections, such as the Bonferroni correction, which
might have been too conservative (25).
RESULTS
Assessment of the meta-analyses and single studies
of RCTs provided 179 individual studies, 15 of which
were published after the USPSTF assessment (6,7). A
flow diagram is presented in Figure 1 (26). Study
characteristics and the Cochrane Risk of Bias were
carried at each trial, and GRADE assessments were
made on all meta-analyses (Online Appendix). Data
are provided for the 4 common supplements taken
(multivitamins, vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin C)
and also for those that were significant for any of
the following: all-cause mortality, CVD mortality,

 Of the 4 most commonly used supplements (multi-
vitamins, vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin C), none had
a significant effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The
summary plots are shown in Figure 2. Furthermore,
none had an effect on all-cause mortality (Figure 2).
The forest plot for vitamin D, the most studied
nutrient, with 43 RCTs, illustrates the lack of harm or
benefit, with 2,908 deaths in 18,719 test subjects and
2,968 deaths in 18,831 control subjects. The point
estimates were divided evenly in favor of vitamin D (16
trials) and in favor of control treatment (17 trials), with
10 trials on the unity line. The overall RR was 0.99
(95% CI: 0.95 to 1.03; p ¼ 0.58), with no heterogeneity
(I2 ¼ 0), high-quality evidence, and convincingly
demonstrated a null effect. Nutrients with significant
effects included folic acid and B-complex vitamins for
stroke reduction, and niacin and antioxidants, which
increased all-cause mortality (Figure 3).

Summary data showing the risk ratios derived from meta-analyses of RCTs of the 4 most commonly consumed vitamins and mineral supplements (multivitamins,
vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin C) on the components of CVD and all-cause mortality. Of note, none of these popular supplements had an effect on CVD or all-cause
mortality. CHD ¼ coronary heart disease; CI ¼ confidence interval; MI ¼ myocardial infarction; RR ¼ risk ratio; other abbreviations as in Figure 1.

 Folic acid in 2 of 7 RCTs reduced stroke risks
(RR: 0.80; p ¼ 0.003) (Figure 4) (27–33), with no
heterogeneity and moderate quality evidence. The
total meta-analysis of the 7 studies showed a benefit
for folic acid driven by the CSPPT (China Stroke
Primary
Prevention
Trial)
study.
CVD
was
also
reduced in the meta-analysis of 5 trials (RR: 0.83;
p ¼ 0.002) (Figure 5) (28,29,33–35).
B-complex vitamins reduced the risk of stroke in 9 of
12 studies in the meta-analysis of 12 RCTs (RR: 0.90;
p ¼ 0.04), with no heterogeneity (I2 ¼ 16%; p ¼ 0.28),
and moderate-quality evidence (Figure 6) (36–47).
Niacin (nicotinic acid) or vitamin B3, taken at
pharmacological doses (1 to 3 g/day) in 3 RCTs, and
when assessed against a background in which a
statin was taken in both the test and control groups
(all with extended-release niacin), was associated
with increased all-cause mortality by 10% (p ¼ 0.05),
with no heterogeneity and moderate-quality evi-
dence (Figure 7) (48–51).
Antioxidant mixtures had no effect on CVD out-
comes, but resulted in an increase in all-cause mor-
tality in the 21 RCT meta-analysis (Figure 8) (52–72),
with a small but significant increase in RRs (1.06;

Summary data derived from forest plot meta-analyses of RCTs that demonstrate positive effects of folic acid and B-vitamin supplements (of which folic acid is a
component) on stroke and marginally significant adverse effects of antioxidants on stroke and niacin and all-cause mortality. Folic acid and stroke prevention
(especially in areas without folic acid fortification) is one of the most conclusive findings in this area over the last 6 years. Abbreviations as in Figures 1 and 2.

 p ¼ 0.05), no heterogeneity, and with moderate-
quality evidence for the RCTs. Studies containing
selenium were removed from the meta-analysis of
antioxidants due to the high percentage of these
studies on the left side of the unity line versus
the right side of the unity line in the antioxidant
forest plot (83% vs. 7%) compared with the other
components
of
antioxidant
mixtures
(Figure
9).
Removal
of
the
selenium
studies
resulted
in
a
significant increase in all-cause mortality (RR: 1.09;
95% CI: 1.04 to 1.13; p ¼ 0.0002; I2 ¼ 0%) (Figure 10)
(52,53,56–58,60–68,72).
The following supplements were associated with
no significant effect on CVD outcomes and all-cause
mortality: vitamins A, B6, and E; b-carotene; zinc;
iron; magnesium; selenium; and multivitamins.
DISCUSSION
In general, the data on the popular supplements
(multivitamins, vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin C)
show no consistent benefit for the prevention of
CVD, MI, or stroke, nor was there a benefit for all-
cause mortality to support their continued use. At
the same time, folic acid alone and B-vitamins with
folic
acid,
B6,
and
B12
reduced
stroke,
whereas
niacin and antioxidants were associated with an
increased risk of all-cause mortality. Overall, the

quantified by the I2 statistic. The data demonstrate that taking slow-release niacin to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol further in those already taking a statin
appears not to benefit CVD outcomes but has a marginally adverse effect on all-cause mortality. NNT for niacin without background statin use and all-cause mortality is
100; number needed to harm (NNH) with background statin use and all-cause mortality is 200. *Sang et al. (49); data taken from the meta-analysis in Keene et al.

 effects were small; the convincing lack of benefit of
vitamin D on all-cause mortality is probably the
reason for the lack of further studies published
since 2013. However, a number of trials with high
doses
(2,000
IU/day)
are
underway
(e.g.,
VITAL
[Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial]; NCT01169259). The
effects
of
folic
acid
in
reducing
stroke
is
also
convincing, with a 20% reduction.
WHAT WAS ALREADY KNOWN? After the latest up-
date of the USPSTF in 2013 (6), their 2014 recom-
mendation statement (7) concluded, “that the current
evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of ben-
efits and harms of single or paired nutrient supple-
ments (except for b-carotene and vitamin E) [that
were recommended against] for the prevention of
cardiovascular disease and cancer.” The USPSTF 2014
report also drew attention to rare but severe harms
seen in some trials, including hip fracture with
vitamin A supplementation and an increased rate of
prostate cancer with folic acid (73–75). None of these
concerns were addressed directly by studies reported
in the past 5 years.
WHAT IS NEW? Since the USPSTF report, the 2015
publication from the large Chinese CSPPT demon-
strated that folic acid supplementation may reduce
CVD, and specifically, stroke (33). This folic acid effect
was the substantial new positive finding on supple-
ment use. Its demonstration in the CSPPT might be
related to the lack of folic acid fortification in China.
Its application to jurisdictions in which there is folic
acid fortification was less certain, and stroke mortal-
ity was not reduced. Nevertheless, inclusion of the
CSPPT in the meta-analysis of folic acid and CVD risk
resulted in a 22% reduction in CVD risk with an NNT
of 111. For comparative purposes, the NNT for statin
use was 72 in the 2016 report of the USPSTF (76).
Furthermore, supplementation with B-complex vita-
mins that included folic acid was also reported to
reduce stroke in RCTs as far back as 2010, with the
publication of the VITATOPS (Vitamins to Prevent

 Stroke) trial (42). Nevertheless, folic acid did not
reduce all-cause mortality, nor was all-cause mortal-
ity reduced by B-complex supplementation in our
large meta-analysis of 16 RCTs. The USPSTF did not
assess B-complex vitamins as such. The original
mechanism proposed by which B-complex vitamins
might reduce stroke was through the reduction of
blood homocysteine levels. However, the reduction
of homocysteine, when achieved, was not associated
with stroke reduction (77,78). In addition, there was
concern that high folic acid intake might increase the
risk of cancer, as seen for prostate cancer in the long-
term follow-up of the SELECT (Selenium and Vitamin
E Cancer Prevention Trial) study (79). Nevertheless,
folic acid administration and the reduction of CVD
through stroke seen in the Chinese CSPPT trial pro-
vided the only example of CVD risk reduction by
supplement use in the period following the Preven-
tive Services Task Recommendations. Whether these
data are sufficient to change clinical practice in areas
of the world where folic acid food fortification is
already in place is still a matter for discussion. In this
respect, the B-complex benefit for stroke offered
support, in that the 12 studies in the meta-analysis
were derived from a variety of jurisdictions. There is
now a call that using B-vitamins collectively for
stroke prevention be reconsidered (80). In addition,
the use of methyl and hydroxocobalamin has been
recommended
to
replace
cyanocobalamin
as
the
B12 source due to the potential buildup of cyanide in
those with renal failure (81,82). Furthermore, it has
been speculated that use of cyanocobalamin may
have obscured the potential benefit of B-vitamin
supplementation
in
some
previous
studies
(81).
However, before folic acid and B-vitamin supple-
mentation enters guidelines as part of the strategy for
the prevention of CVD, large trials of folic acid and B-
vitamins are required. This caution is relevant to ju-
risdictions (e.g., North America) where there is folic
acid supplementation, to assess the effects, not only
on CVD, but more importantly, on all-cause mortality.
In the current statin era, the effect of niacin in
increasing all-cause mortality by 10% (NNT ¼ 200) in
data for 3 RCTs (all of which used extended-release
niacin) cautions against long-term use of extended-
release (nonflush) niacin as an adjunct to statin
therapy.
Of particular interest was the lack of a clear effect of
supplements in general on CVD outcomes and all-
cause mortality. This lack of effect was particularly
notable when large numbers of studies were available,
such as for vitamin D with or without calcium. In view
of the potential benefits of vitamin D for diabetes
(83,84) and calcium for colon cancer (85–88), it was
expected that these potential benefits would reflect
changes in all-cause mortality. In contrast to this

 expectation was the fact that long-term studies might
be required to detect changes in reduced incidence. In
addition, the impact of a reduction in these diseases
might be too low to be reflected in all-cause mortality.
Furthermore,
overall
health
benefits
were
ex-
pected for multivitamin and multimineral use that
also might have been reflected in reduced CVD risk. It
has often been noted that a significant proportion of
Western diets are not optimal, and it has been
reasoned that supplementation could rectify poten-
tial deficiencies (89,90). If there are no potential
adverse effects to supplementation, then it can be
argued that some benefits might have been seen, but
as yet, they have not.
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. The strength of this
review was that it provided an update on the USPSTF
assessment but focused on the components of CVD:
MI, stroke, and their associated mortalities.
The weaknesses included our lack of consideration
of data from the fixed-effects model and from the
results from cohort studies. RCTs are often of shorter
duration, whereas cohorts of longer duration might
be required to fully capture chronic disease risk.
Participants in RCTs are often more health-conscious,
and therefore, they were not representative of the
general population. Supplement differences might
also have influenced outcomes. Adherence to and
persistence with supplement use were also an issue.
Furthermore, dose�response data were not usually
available. However, cohorts might be larger and
longer than many RCTs, which would allow the ef-
fects of the dose to be assessed. This might require
multiple
assessments
over
time
and
might
be
confounded by many lifestyle and dietary factors in
supplement users that might be difficult to adjust for
adequately. Finally, combining different types of
antioxidants
might
be
suboptimal,
because
their
mechanisms
of
action
might
also
be
different.
Nevertheless, when studies containing selenium were
removed from the meta-analysis, the significance
level favoring control increased from p ¼ 0.05 to
p ¼ 0.0002 (Figure 10), although the risk ratio only
increased from 6% to 9% with a number needed to
harm reduction of 250 to 127.
We used a random effect model for our meta-
analyses. However, the random effects approach
might be unsatisfactory when there is heterogeneity
among studies because it gives undue weight to

Therefore, these supplements cannot be advised for CVD risk reduction. The NNH for antioxidant supplementation and all-cause mortality risk is 127. Abbreviations as in
Figures 1, 2, 4, and 7.

 smaller studies at the extremes, whereas a fixed-effect
model reduces this false irregularity (91). Random ef-
fects models assess no fixed or “true” treatment effect,
but assess a distribution of effects. The random effects
model therefore provided a more conservative sum-
mary effect estimate, although in the absence of het-
erogeneity (I2 ¼ 0%) both approaches provided the
same results.
CONCLUSIONS
Since the 2013 to 2014 assessment and report of the
USPSTF (7), the most notable finding was the effect of
folic acid in reducing stroke and CVD, with signifi-
cance driven by the 5-year 20,000 Chinese CSPPT
RCT, which was supported by the reduction in stroke
seen in RCTs of B-complex vitamins in which folic
acid was a component. Vitamin B3 (or niacin) might
increase
all-cause
mortality,
which
was
possibly
related to its adverse effects on glycemic response
(51,92).
Antioxidant
mixtures
did
not
appear
to
benefit CVD but might increase all-cause mortality.
Although sufficient studies on vitamin D exist, to be
confident that there is no all-cause mortality effect,
further studies on multivitamins, the most commonly
used supplement, may still be useful, because of the
marginal benefit seen in our analysis. In the absence
of further studies, the current data on supplement
use reinforce advice to focus on healthy dietary pat-
terns, with an increased proportion of plant foods in
which many of these required vitamins and minerals
can be found (5,93).
The authors are happy to share their database with
those who request it, either for verification or for
collaborative purposes.
