BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Metabolic
syndrome
(MetS) is the co-occurrence of obesity and metabolic
derangements. Prior research implicates MetS in prolonga-
tion of the course of depression in older adults, but its
effect on antidepressant response is unknown in this popu-
lation. The objective was to determine whether MetS and
related metabolic dyscrasias are associated with decreased
rate of remission from depression in older adults treated
pharmacologically for depression.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled
trial.
SETTING: Three
academic
medical
centers
in
North
America.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 60 and older (mean age
69.1) with major depressive disorder (MDD) (N = 435).
INTERVENTION: Open-label,
protocolized
treatment
with extended-release venlafaxine for 12 or more weeks.
MEASUREMENTS: Time to remission from depression,
with remission defined as a Montgomery-�
Asberg Depres-
sion Rating Scale (MADRS) score of 10 or less at last two
visits.
RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two participants (51%)
met criteria for MetS at baseline; MetS was associated
with greater severity (MADRS score) and chronicity of
depression at baseline. Remission was achieved in 182 par-
ticipants (42%). In the unadjusted analysis, MetS was
associated with prolonged time to remission (hazard ratio
for
remission = 0.71,
95%
confidence
interval = 0.52–
0.95), but this relationship was not significant in the
adjusted model; greater number of MetS components and
lower
high-density
lipoprotein
cholesterol
had
similar
effects.
Only
diastolic
blood
pressure
(DBP)
was
a
significant predictor of time to remission before and after
adjustment, with higher DBP predicting longer time to
remission. Insulin sensitivity did not predict time to remis-
sion.
CONCLUSION: The presence of MetS in older adults
with depression was associated with greater symptom
severity and chronicity of depression, which appears to
have accounted for the poorer antidepressant response
observed in those with MetS. Additionally, our preliminary
finding of an association between higher DBP and poorer
antidepressant response bears further examination and
replication. J Am Geriatr Soc 65:2651–2658, 2017.

T
he prevalence of MDD is estimated at 4.4% world-
wide,1 high rates of treatment resistance: fewer than
40% will achieve remission during an initial course of
treatment .2,3 In older adults, the consequences of depres-
sion, including cognitive decline,4 greater healthcare use,5
functional decline,6,7 and greater overall mortality,8 have
prompted an aggressive search for predictors of therapeutic
response,
such
as
cerebrovascular
disease,9,10
genetic
factors,11 peripheral biomarkers, and symptomatic pheno-
types.12,13 It was recently demonstrated14 that manage-
ment of depression reduces mortality in older adults with
multimorbidity and depression.
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as a combina-
tion of obesity and two or more of the following compo-
nents: hypertension, high triglycerides, low high-density
lipoprotein (HDL-C), and fasting hyperglycemia.15 It has
been postulated that MetS affects the prevalence and sever-
ity of depressive disorders.16,17 The association is bidirec-
tional, with depression predicting MetS and vice versa.16

 ages have yielded varied results; one study18 found no
association
between
MetS
and
treatment
resistance,
whereas two others19 and20 associated treatment resistance
with metabolic dysfunction but did not evaluate MetS
specifically.
Treatment response in late-life depression (LLD) might
be particularly linked to MetS, because both conditions
are highly prevalent in older adults, share a variety of
mechanistic links,21 and result in shared downstream
effects,
including
cardiovascular
and
cerebrovascular
sequelae.22,23 Only two studies have examined the course
of LLD in the context of MetS. One24 found that MetS
(but no individual MetS components) predicted depression
chronicity. The other25 also found that MetS predicted a
chronic course of depression but not after multivariate
adjustment; number of MetS components, waist circumfer-
ence, and HDL-C were predictive of depression chronicity
as well. A limitation of both studies is that the treatment
of LLD was not standardized or well described, so these
studies could not evaluate the association between MetS
and treatment resistance.
The Incomplete Response in Late Life Depression:
Getting to Remission (IRL GRey) study was conducted to
better inform therapy for treatment-resistant depression in
older adults.26 Participants aged 60 and older with MDD
were treated with open-label venlafaxine extended-release
(XR) 150 to 300 mg/d for 12 weeks; nonremitters were
then randomized 1:1 to receive aripiprazole or placebo.
When the study was initiatially conceived, the concept of
metabolic depression had not been fully explored in the lit-
erature, but during the course of the study, it became clear
that components of metabolic syndrome may affect depres-
sion treatment response. Data from the initial phase of
treatment with venlafaxine offered a prime opportunity to
test the hypothesis that, in older adults in North America
(where MetS is prevalent), comorbid MetS may predict
poorer response to treatment of MDD. Based on the afore-
mentioned associations between MetS and depression, we
hypothesized that the presence of MetS would predict a
prolonged time to remission from depression (primary
hypothesis); participants with more MetS components
would have a prolonged time to remission; given the cen-
tral role of insulin resistance in MetS and the multiple
pathophysiological links between diabetes mellitus and
MDD,27 a surrogate measure of insulin resistance, the
Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance
(HOMA-IR) value, would also be independently associated
with a prolonged time to remission.
METHODS
Description of Parent Study
Inclusion criteria for IRL GRey were aged 60 and older
with nonpsychotic MDD and a MADRS score of 15 or
higher.26 Exclusion criteria included dementia or other
cognitive impairment evidenced by a Mini-Mental Status
Examination (MMSE) score of 20 or less,28 bipolar disor-
der,
schizophrenia,
schizoaffective
disorder,
psychosis,
alcohol or substance misuse or dependence in the preced-
ing 6 months, and unstable medical illness. Participants
were recruited at the University of Pittsburgh, the Centre
for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, and Wash-
ington University in St Louis from July 2009 to December
2013. Respective site institutional review boards approved
the study protocol, and all participants provided written,
informed consent. Further details on sample-size determi-
nation, recruitment, enrollment, randomization, assess-
ments,
procedures,
and

are

Assessments
MADRS assesses the severity of 10 depressive symptoms,
with a total score ranging from 0 (absence of any depres-
sive symptoms) to 60 (apparent sadness, reported sadness,
inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentra-
tion difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic
thoughts, and suicidal thoughts).29 Presence of MetS was
determined at baseline using the International Diabetes
Federation (IDF) worldwide consensus definition, which
requires central obesity based on body mass index (BMI)
or waist circumference (WC) (see below) and two or more
of high triglyceride levels, low HDL-C, high blood pres-
sure, and high fasting plasma glucose.15 Obesity was
defined as a BMI of 30.0 kg/m2 or more or by reaching a
sex-specific waist circumference cutoff (≥80 cm in women
of all races and ethnicities, ≥90 for South Asian, Japanese
and Chinese men or ≥94 cm in Caucasian men). High
triglyceride level was defined as 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L)
or greater or specific treatment. Low HDL-C was defined
as less than 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in men or less than
50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) in women or specific treatment.
High blood pressure was defined as systolic blood pressure
(SBP) of 130 mmHg or greater, diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) of 85 mmHg or greater, or treatment for hyperten-
sion. High fasting glucose was defined as a fasting plasma
glucose of 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) or greater or previ-
ously diagnosed diabetes mellitus type 2. Waist circumfer-
ence was determined by measuring halfway between the
inferior margin of the ribs and the iliac crest. Weight and
height were determined with light clothing on, shoes
removed, and pockets emptied. Blood pressure was mea-
sured seated after 5 minutes of rest. In cases in which mul-
tiple baseline readings of these parameters were made,
data that most closely preceded initiation of treatment
were used. History of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, low
HDL-C, or hypertriglyceridemia and active pharmacother-
apy for the same were assessed according to participant
report. According to IDF recommendations, individuals
meeting criteria for these MetS components according to
history or medication use were included in our analyses.
Blood samples were drawn from participants in a fasting
state. HOMA-IR was calculated as follows: (fasting insulin
(lU/mL)) 9 (fasting glucose (mg/dL))/405.30
Procedures
Open-label venlafaxine XR was initiated at 37.5 mg/d in
all participants and uptitrated in increments of 37.5 mg/d
after a minimum of 3 days, targeting 150 mg/d. After
6 weeks of treatment, if MADRS score remained greater
than 10, venlafaxine dosage was increased by increments
of 37.5 to 75 mg/d over at least 3 days based on clinical
2652

 response and as symptomatically tolerated, up to a maxi-
mum dose of 300 mg/d. Those experiencing side effects
underwent slower titration or received a lower dose.
MADRS score was re-assessed at in-person follow-up visits
every 1 to 2 weeks. After 12 weeks (or longer, if neces-
sary, to allow for 4 weeks on the highest-tolerated dose of
venlafaxine or to clarify remission status), participants
were categorized as having remitted or not, with remission
defined as reaching a MADRS score 10 or less for the last
2 follow-up visits. Participants were allowed to continue
outside psychotherapy and medications for anxiety or
sleep.
Statistical Analysis
Differences in baseline characteristics between those with
and without MetS were evaluated using a two-tailed t-test
or Wilcoxon test for continuous variables and a chi-square
or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. The associa-
tion between MetS status and remission from depression
was assessed using the chi-square test. For our primary
hypothesis, Cox proportional hazards regression was used
to test for effect of MetS status on time to remission. In
this model, a longer time to remission corresponds to a
lower hazard ratio for remission. Univariate proportional
hazards regression models were similarly created for each
metabolic variable listed in Table 1 to investigate effect on
time to remission. Then, MetS status, individual values for
metabolic paramters, and treatment with antihypertensive
and lipid- and glucose-lowering agents were included sepa-
rately in an adjusted model. The adjusted model included
demographic and depression-related variables found in
stepwise proportional hazards regression to predict time to
remission at a significance level of .05. The variables eval-
uated for predictive effect were age, sex, education, living
status (alone or with others), study site, referral source,
outside psychotherapy, baseline total MADRS score, dura-
tion of current depressive episode (dichotomized to > or ≤
2 years), recurrent depression or single episode, MMSE,
Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsycholog-
ical Status (RBANS,31 score, and prior antidepressant
treatment assessed using the Antidepressant Treatment
History Form (ATHF)32 as dichotomized to 2 or less (no
prior adequate antidepressant trial in this depressive epi-
sode) or 3 or greater (≥1 adequate trials). Because obstruc-
tive sleep apnea has been previously associated with
treatment resistance in this sample,33 this analysis was not
repeated here. Analyses were performed on SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Of 435 participants with MDD beginning venlafaxine
(Table 1), 211 did not meet criteria for MetS, 222 met crite-
ria for MetS, and 2 could not be classified because of miss-
ing data. The MetS group had greater baseline symptom
severity as measured using total MADRS and Hamilton
Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD)34 scores and MADRS
symptom scores for reported sadness, reduced sleep, and
lassitude, and greater duration of depressive episode; site
distribution varied according to MetS status, as well. The
majority of our sample had been previously treated for their
current depressive episode, with 59.1% having received an
adequate course of antidepressant treatment corresponding
to an ATHF score of 3 or more, with trendline ATHF score
observed in those with MetS. Measures of most metabolic
parameters differed according MetS status as expected,
except low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and
total cholesterol, which were higher in the group without
MetS. Those with MetS also had greater medical illness bur-
den as measured using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale
for Geriatrics (CIRS-G)35 and greater prevalence of cardio-
vascular disease. The groups were similar in all other base-
line characteristics (Table 1).
Relationship Between MetS and Remission
Of the participants in the parent study, 182 (41.8%)
reached a sustained MADRS score of 10 or less (remission),
160 did not remit, and 93 left the study before completing
12 weeks of therapy (Figure 1). Those with MetS were less
likely to remit (36.9%) than those without MetS (46.5%,
chi-square = 4.03, degrees of freedom (df) = 1, P = .04).
There was no difference in proportion of participants with-
drawing from the study according to MetS status (21.6%
vs 21.3%, chi-square = 0.0056, df = 1, P = .94).
Univariate
Cox
proportional
hazards
regression
demonstrated greater time to remission in participants
with MetS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.71, 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 0.52–0.95, P = .02; Table 2) than in those
without. Stepwise proportional hazards regression identi-
fied female sex (HR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.21–1.88) and
ATHF score of 2 or less (HR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.23–
1.82) as predicting decreased time to remission, while
greater duration of depressive episode (HR = 0.68, 95%
CI = 0.36–0.99),
and
greater
baseline
MADRS
score
(HR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.90–0.96) predictors of longer
time to remission. When these variables were combined to
construct the fully adjusted model, MetS lost significance
as a predictor of time to remission (HR = 0.86, 95%
CI = 0.64–1.16).
Individual Metabolic Variables As Predictors of Time
to Remission
Univariate proportional hazard regression models found
that higher HDL-C levels (HR = 1.11 per 10 mg/dL, 95%
CI = 1.02–1.21)
predicted
shorter
time
to
remission,
whereas higher DBP (HR = 0.88 per 10 mmHg, 95%
CI = 0.77–0.995) and more MetS components (HR = 0.89
per component, 95% CI = 0.80–0.99) predicted greater
time to remission. Upon introduction to the adjusted
model, only DBP (HR = 0.87 per 10 mmHg increase,
95% CI = 0.77–0.99) remained a significant predictor.
HOMA-IR was not a significant predictor of time to
remission in univariate or adjusted models (Table 2). Cere-
brovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, and smoking
were not predictive of time to remission.
We
also
examined
whether
medications
targeting
blood pressure, lipids, and glucose would confound analy-
ses of these metabolic parameters’ effects on time to remis-
sion by inserting each as an individual variable in the

 univariate model, without adjustments for disease-related
and demographic variables, and found no such effects
(data not shown). Use of co-prescribed beta-blockers, or
any antihypertensives, had no effect on time to remission
for DBP (which remained significant) or SBP or pulse pres-
sure (which remained nonsignificant). HDL-C remained
significant after adjusting for use of lipid-lowering drugs,
and LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides remained
nonsignificant. Finally, no moderating effect was found of
use of glucose-lowering drugs and insulin, glucose, or
HOMA-IR on time to remission, with all remaining non-
significant (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In this study of older adults with MDD, we evaluated the
effect of MetS on remission with antidepressant treatment.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine this
relationship in older adults, as well as the first to do so in
a North American population with a high prevalence of
MetS. We had three importatn findings. First, MetS was
associated with more-severe depression, including greater
symptom severity and longer duration of depression. Sec-
ond, the presences of MetS was associated with a longer
time to remission of depressive symptoms during antide-
pressant
treatment,
although
the
relationship
was
no
longer significant after controlling for these severity mark-
ers. In other words, the greater severity of depression
observed in individuals with MetS appears to account for
their poorer treatment response. Third, having more MetS
components and lower HDL-C predicted greater time to
remission but not after multivariate adjustment; only
higher DBP predicted greater time to remission, with and
without inclusion of covariates.
Although two previous studies (Vogelzangs et al.19 and
Marijnissen et al.25) found number of MetS components
and low HDL-C to predict chronicity of depression, to our
knowledge, such an effect of DBP on chronicity or treat-
ment response in depression has not been previously
reported. Moreover, DBP was the only variable to remain
significant in our adjusted analyses. These results tenta-
tively link high DBP with treatment-resistant depression.
Cerebrovascular disease burden could be one mediator of
such an effect. Hypertension is an established risk factor
for vascular depression,36 but its relationship with LLD
more broadly has not been proven.37 There are no univer-
sally accepted diagnostic criteria for vascular depression,
but it is generally characterized by later age of onset than
other types of depression, and in the settting of atheroscle-
rotic risk factors and radiographic evidence of cerebrovas-
cular disease.10,38 Clinical features include psychomotor
slowing, apathy, and greater cognitive impairment than

EFFECT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME ON LATE-LIFE DEPRESSION

 hyperactivity, which serves as a central common mecha-
nism linking depression with MetS, although its relevance
to antidepressant response is not well established.39
Limitations and Strengths
A primary limitation of our study concerns the associa-
tions
observed
between
MetS
and
greater
symptom
severity, longer duration of depressive episode, and trend-
line ATHF score. Given the cross-sectional nature of the
baseline data, causality cannot be assessed. Literature on
association between the MetS and depressive symptom
severity has been equivocal, with some,40,41 but not all,25
previous authors reporting a positive relationship. Other
collinear effects could also partly explain the effect of
MetS on time to remission; for example, obstructive sleep
apnea, a potent predictor of resistance to antidepressant
treatment in this same study population,33 was highly cor-
related with MetS status in our sample.
We were unable to detect an effect of insulin concen-
tration or HOMA-IR on remission, despite well-known
epidemiological and mechanistic links between diabetes
mellitus, insulin resistance and depression.27 HOMA-IR is
a well-validated surrogate measure of insulin resistance in
large populations and is correlated with more-sensitive
measures in younger populations,42 although it may have
limited utility to detect age-related insulin resistance in
smaller populations, particularly in older adults.43 It is
likely that this, in addition to missing insulin samples for a
portion of study participants (Table 1), limited the power
to detect effects of insulin resistance on treatment response
in late-life depression.
Racial and ethnic minorities were not well represented
in the study sample, decreasing generalizability of our find-
ings to nonwhite populations. These results should be
interpreted with caution, because race has been shown to
modulate obesity’s effects on prevalence of depression.44,45
Inclusion of individuals in the MetS group who had the
requisite number of MetS components because of medical
history and treatment of low HDL-C, high triglycerides,
hypertension, or diabetes mellitus, in accordance with IDF
criteria for MetS, in our analytical model could have
increased the likelihood of type 2 error. Additionally,
although higher DBP could prolong time to remission by
increassing cerebrovascular disease burden, no cerebral
imaging was available to correlate cerebrovascular disease
markers
with
metabolic
derangement
and
treatment
response. Finally, use of venlafaxine in a highly standard-
ized dosing algorithm by all participants is a weakness and
strength. Although the generalizability of these results to
other antidepressants is unknown, more-reliable compar-
isons between participants can be drawn. A recent meta-
analysis of treatment studies for MDD in older adults
demonstrated greater efficacy of sertraline, paroxetine, and
duloxetine than of placebo, which was not the case for
venlafaxine in the sole included study featuring venlafax-
ine; metabolic variables were not discussed or adjusted
for.46
The sample was metabolically well characterized and
might offer useful insights into the relationship between
MetS, other metabolic variables, and depression treatment
response. Other study strengths include a fairly large sam-
ple of older adults with MDD and a high prevalence of
MetS from three sites in North America, lending greater
generalizability to the study’s findings.
In conclusion, we report an association between MetS
and poorer antidepressant response in elderly persons with
MDD, which greater symptom severity and duration of
depression at baseline appears to account for. Random-
ized, prospective depression treatment studies measuring

 metabolic and depressive outcomes are indicated to better
understand the causal relationship between MetS, depres-
sion severity, and treatment response. Of individual MetS
components, DBP remained a significant predictor of treat-
ment outcome after multivariate adjustment. The results of
this study should be interpreted with caution. We do not
recommend that clinicians treat older adults with depres-
sion differently in the face of co-occuring MetS. Further
verification of these findings is indicated using more-reli-
able markers of insulin resistance and other classes of
antidepressants in racially diverse populations in the hopes
of better informing treatment decisions in LLD.
