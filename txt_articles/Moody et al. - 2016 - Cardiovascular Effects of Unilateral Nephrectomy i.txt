hronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent and 
confers an increased risk of cardiovascular disease; at 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values of <60 
mL/min/1.73m2, risk increases with a graded relationship to 
eGFR.1 A 30% lower eGFR has been consistently associated 
with a 20% to 30% higher risk of major vascular events and 
all-cause mortality.2 Whether this relationship is causative 
remains unclear, and potential mechanisms of disease are still 
under investigation.3 Patients with CKD have a clustering of 
conventional atherosclerosis risk factors such as hypertension 
and diabetes, yet these factors perform poorly in risk prediction 
models.4,5 Furthermore, the majority of adverse cardiovascu-
lar events in late-stage CKD are not caused by atherosclerotic 
events such as myocardial infarction, but are attributable 
to heart failure and sudden cardiac death.6 These findings, 
together with data from imaging and pathophysiological stud-
ies, suggest that structural left ventricular (LV) disease and 
increased arterial stiffness may be the key pathogenic media-
tors of cardiovascular disease in CKD.7,8 However, the numer-
ous coexistent risk factors found in patients with CKD make it 
difficult to be certain that the reduction in renal function is a 
causative risk factor.
Kidney donors are ideal subjects to study the effects of 
a reduction in kidney function on the cardiovascular system. 
After donation, there is an immediate 50% reduction in GFR 
followed by a gradual improvement to 60% to 70% of baseline 
as a result of hypertrophy and hyperfiltration in the remaining 
kidney.9 Nonetheless, at 1-year, eGFR is <60 mL/min/1.73m2 
in up to one third of subjects.10,11 Unlike patients with 
CKD, however, kidney donors have almost no confounding 
Abstract—There is a robust inverse graded association between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and cardiovascular risk, 
but proof of causality is lacking. Emerging data suggest living kidney donation may be associated with increased 
cardiovascular mortality although the mechanisms are unclear. We hypothesized that the reduction in GFR in living 
kidney donors is associated with increased left ventricular mass, impaired left ventricular function, and increased aortic 
stiffness. This was a multicenter, parallel group, blinded end point study of living kidney donors and healthy controls 
(n=124), conducted from March 2011 to August 2014. The primary outcome was a change in left ventricular mass 
assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (baseline to 12 months). At 12 months, the decrease in isotopic GFR in donors 
was −30±12 mL/min/1.73m2. In donors compared with controls, there were significant increases in left ventricular 
mass (+7±10 versus −3±8 g; P<0.001) and mass:volume ratio (+0.06±0.12 versus −0.01±0.09 g/mL; P<0.01), whereas 
aortic distensibility (−0.29±1.38 versus +0.28±0.79×10−3 mm Hg−1; P=0.03) and global circumferential strain decreased 
(−1.1±3.8 versus +0.4±2.4%; P=0.04). Donors had greater risks of developing detectable highly sensitive troponin T 
(odds ratio, 16.2 [95% confidence interval, 2.6–100.1]; P<0.01) and microalbuminuria (odds ratio, 3.8 [95% confidence 
interval, 1.1–12.8]; P=0.04). Serum uric acid, parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor-23, and high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein all increased significantly. There were no changes in ambulatory blood pressure. Change in GFR was 
independently associated with change in left ventricular mass (R2=0.28; P=0.01). These findings suggest that reduced 
GFR should be regarded as an independent causative cardiovascular risk factor.

comorbidity. The Chronic Renal Impairment in Birmingham 
(CRIB)–Donor study was designed to test the hypothesis that 
the reduction in renal function in living kidney donors is asso-
ciated with adverse structural and functional cardiovascular 
effects.
Methods
Study Design
The CRIB-Donor protocol has been reported in detail.12 The study had 
a prospective, longitudinal, parallel group, blinded end point design 
comparing living kidney donors with similarly healthy controls and 
was conducted between March 2011 and August 2014 (Figure 1). 
The study was approved by the West Midlands Research Ethics 
Committee, adhered to the principles set out by the Declaration of 
Helsinki, and was registered with the US National Institutes of Health 
database (NCT01769924). The conduct and reporting of this study 
were guided by the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational 
Studies in Epidemiology statement.13 All participants gave written 
informed consent.
Study Population
Eligible donors were recruited from 2 University hospital–based UK 
transplant centers. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical 
to those set out in the United Kingdom Guidelines for Living Donor 
Kidney Transplantation compiled by the Joint Working Party of The 
British Transplantation Society and The Renal Association (Tables S1 
and S2 in the online-only Data Supplement).14 To provide a closely 
matched control population with equivalent baseline health status 
to the donor cohort, both donors and controls underwent identical 
screening tests. Control participants were recruited from the same 
living donor clinics, by identifying individuals who after screening 
were found to be fit for donation but did not proceed to surgery (eg, 
because of arterial anatomy, immunological mismatch, or recipient-
related health issues). Donor-related family members and subjects 
attending blood donation and community healthcare facilities who 
fulfilled medical fitness criteria for living kidney donation were also 
invited to participate as controls (Figure 1).
Study Protocol
A flow chart of the study protocol is available in Figure S1. 
Investigations were performed in each participant at baseline (within 
6 weeks before nephrectomy in donors), with subsequent follow-up 
studies performed at 6 and 12 months. Kidney donors underwent rou-
tine follow-up by their local medical and surgical team with no altera-
tion to normal care.
Outcomes
The primary end point was the change in LV mass at 12 months, as 
measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Secondary 
end points comprised changes in GFR by isotopic and creatinine-
based methods; LV mass:volume ratio by cardiac MRI; office and 
ambulatory blood pressure; aortic distensibility by MRI; LV strain 
indices by cardiac MRI feature tracking; urinary albumin:creatinine 
ratio; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP); serum N-terminal 
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTpro-BNP), and highly sensitive 
troponin T. Potential mediators of increased LV mass were also mea-
sured; these comprised renin, aldosterone, uric acid, parathyroid hor-
mone (PTH), and fibroblast growth factor-23.
Figure 1. Study timeline. *Twenty-eight participants who did not proceed to living kidney donation were followed as nondonor controls 
(alternative family member donated [n=12]; recipient health-related issues [n=10]; cadaveric transplant [n=3]; and complicated arterial 
anatomy [n=3]). BP indicates blood pressure; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; and LVH, left ventricular hypertrophy.

Cardiac MRI
All studies were performed on a 1.5-T scanner (MAGNETOM 
Avanto; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). LV size, function, and mass 
were assessed using serial contiguous short-axis cine images piloted 
from the vertical long-axis and horizontal long-axis images of the left 
and right ventricles (retrospective electrocardiographic gating, SSFP 
[True-FISP], temporal resolution 40–50 ms, repetition time 3.2 ms, 
echo time 1.7 ms, flip angle 60°, slice thickness 7 mm with 3-mm 
gap) in accordance with previously validated methodology.15
Quantification of LV Mass
All LV measurements were made off-line in a Core laboratory by 
a single observer (W.E.M.) blinded to subject group and temporal 
sequence (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Software, cvi42, version 
4.2.1, Calgary, Canada). Manual planimetry of the short-axis epicar-
dial and endocardial contours in end-diastole and end-systole was 
performed using standardized methods.15 Mass was calculated as end-
diastolic epicardial−endocardial volume×1.05. LV mass was indexed 
to body surface area using the Mosteller formula. The mass:volume 
ratio calculated as LV mass/LV end-diastolic volume was used as an 
index of concentric LV remodeling.16
Assessment of LV Systolic and Diastolic Function
Systolic and diastolic function was assessed using cardiac MRI fea-
ture tracking (TomTec 2D Cardiac Performance Analysis, Munich, 
Germany).17 Longitudinal atrioventricular plane displacement was 
measured in the septum and lateral wall as the distance travelled by 
the respective annulus from end-diastole to end-systole.15 The biplane 
area–length method was used to measure left atrial volume.18
Aortic Distensibility
Distensibility of the proximal ascending aorta was assessed 
at the level of the pulmonary artery using the formula: aortic 
distensibility=Δaortic area/(minimum aortic area×pulse pressure).19,20 
The measurement of aortic cross-sectional area in systole and diastole 
was made off-line using automated software (Matlab 6.5; MathWorks 
Inc., Natick, MA).21
Blood Pressure
Resting blood pressure was measured in triplicate in the nondominant 
arm using a validated oscillometric sphygmomanometer (Dinamap 
Procare 200; GE Healthcare, United Kingdom) after 15 minutes of 
supine rest. The mean of the last 2 brachial blood pressure measure-
ments was used in analysis. Subjects also underwent 24-hour ambu-
latory blood pressure monitoring (Mobil-O-Graph; IEM GmbH, 
Stolberg, Germany).
Measurement of Carotid Intima-Media Thickness
Right and left common carotid arteries were imaged using high-reso-
lution ultrasound (Philips iE33, L9-3 MHz linear array transducer) 1 
cm proximal to the carotid bifurcation in accordance with published 
guidelines.22 Common carotid intima-media thickness was measured 
as the distance between lumen-intima and media-adventitia inter-
faces using automated wall tracking software (IMT plug-in, QLAB). 
The mean of the right and left carotid measurements was used for 
analysis.
Assessment of Kidney Function
Isotopic GFR (iGFR) was performed at baseline and 12 months 
in donors and controls using the renal clearance of 51Cr-EDTA.23 
The CKD-EPI (Epidemiology Collaboration) equation was used to 
determine eGFRcr with serum creatinine recalibrated to be trace-
able to an isotope-derived mass spectroscopy method.24 Urinary 
albumin:creatinine ratio was determined from a spot morning urine 
sample.25 Moderately increased albuminuria (category A2, formerly 
microalbuminuria) was defined by an albumin:creatinine ratio of 30 
to 300 mg/g.26 The methods used for biomarker assessment are avail-
able in the online-only Data Supplement.
Reproducibility
To assess intraobserver report variability of LV mass measurement, 
10 baseline studies were reanalyzed by the same observer (W.E.M) 
4 weeks later, blinded to the original data. A random subset of par-
ticipants (n=10) also underwent repeat imaging within 7 days to 
determine interstudy reproducibility; both scans were analyzed by 
the same observer (W.E.M) blinded to temporal sequence and patient 
identity. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation 
coefficient with a model of absolute agreement.

Sample Size Determination
Sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome of change 
in LV mass. Assuming an SD of change in LV mass of 12 g based on 
our own data from a previous intervention study in CKD,27 a sample 
size of 55 subjects per group provided 90% power to detect a change 
in LV mass of 7.5 g with a α=0.05. Therefore, we aimed to recruit 70 
patients per group to allow for potential loss to follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as mean±SD, median (interquartile range), or fre-
quency (%), unless otherwise stated. The normality of distribution 
for continuous variables was determined using the Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test. Variables not normally distributed were log-trans-
formed. Baseline data were analyzed using independent samples 
Student t or Fisher exact tests. The primary analysis tested differ-
ences between groups >12 months using repeated-measures ANOVA. 
A further quantitative analysis was performed using a last observa-
tion carried forward principle. Generalized estimating equations were 
used to compare donors with controls for the likelihood of developing 
detectable serum and urinary biomarkers >12 months. Independent 
predictors of changes in LV mass were determined using multivari-
able logistic regression. To allow for multiple comparisons, P values 
were adjusted using the Holm–Bonferroni method. A 2-tailed P<0.05 
was considered statistically significant.
Results
Study Participants
A total of 124 subjects were enrolled (68 donors and 56 con-
trols). The first participant entered the study in March 2011 
and recruitment continued until August 2013 with the last fol-
low-up visit in August 2014. Because of resource constraints, 
recruitment was terminated before reaching our prespeci-
fied target (140) but after attaining adequate numbers with 
12-month follow-up data to provide >85% power to detect the 
specified change in LV mass. Baseline characteristics of the 2 
study groups are shown in Table 1. There were no significant 
differences between groups. Three donors (5%) were on anti-
hypertensive therapy at baseline. For all participants, blood 
pressure was <140/90 mm Hg.
Follow-Up and Events
Eleven donors did not complete follow-up to 12 months 
(Figure 1); 2 declined continued participation because of the 
travelling involved, 8 could not be contacted, and 1 was with-
drawn after diagnosis of a malignancy. No subjects died or 
had a cardiovascular event during the study.
Change in Kidney Function and Biochemical Effects
The changes in biochemical indices and cardiovascular disease 
biomarkers are presented in Table 2. There was a mean decrease 
in iGFR in donors of −30±12 mL/min/1.73m2 and no clini-
cally significant change in controls (−1±10 mL/min/1.73m2; 
P<0.001). At 12 months, over one third of donors (35%) had an 
iGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2, whereas more than one half (53%) 
had an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2. When compared with con-
trols, donors had significant increases in uric acid (+0.94±0.59 
versus +0.03±0.55 mg/dL; P<0.001), iPTH (+1.1±1.6 versus 
+0.4±1.3 pg/mL; P=0.03), fibroblast growth factor-23 (+18 [+7 
to +26] versus +3 [−7 to +17] RU/mL; P=0.046), and hsCRP 
(+1.7±5.3 versus −0.7±5.2 mg/dL; P<0.01). Detectable highly 
sensitive troponin T (odds ratio, 16.2 [95% confidence inter-
val, 2.6–100.1]; P<0.01) and microalbuminuria (odds ratio, 
3.74 [95% confidence interval, 1.09–12.75]; P=0.04) became 
significantly more common in donors than in controls. There 
were no significant changes in levels of renin or aldosterone.
Effects on LV Mass, Volumes, and Function
The effects of nephrectomy on cardiac structure and func-
tion are presented in Table 3. LV mass increased significantly 
in donors when compared with controls (+7±10 versus −3±8

controls (−1±2 versus 0±2 mm; P=0.03). LV systolic function 
as measured by global circumferential strain was reduced with 
directionally similar but nonsignificant changes in global longi-
tudinal strain. There was no difference in mean left atrial volume.
Effects on Hemodynamics and Arterial Stiffness 
and Structure
In donors, there was a significant reduction in aortic distensi-
bility at 12 months post nephrectomy (−0.29±1.38×10–3 versus 
+0.28±0.79×10–3 mm Hg−1; P=0.03). There were no significant 
differences between donors and controls in any office or ambu-
latory measures of blood pressure (Table 3). There was no 
change in carotid intima-media thickness in donors or controls.
Determinants of LV Mass
Univariate analysis showed that there was an association between 
the baseline LV mass and the iGFR (β=0.3; R2=0.09; P=0.007). 
There was also an association between the increase in LV mass 
and the decrease in iGFR (β=−0.3; R2=0.19; P<0.001). This rela-
tionship remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, base-
line LV mass, and 12-month changes in blood pressure, uric acid, 
iPTH, and fibroblast growth factor-23 (β=−0.3; R2=0.28; P=0.01).
Reproducibility
Intraobserver and interstudy variability for LV mass was low 
(intraclass correlation coefficient [95% confidence interval], 
0.99 [0.98–1.00] and 0.98 [0.91–1.00], respectively).
Discussion
This study has demonstrated that unilateral nephrectomy in 
healthy subjects is associated with structural and functional car-
diovascular abnormalities within 1 year. There was an increase 
in LV mass, which had a graded independent association with 
the reduction in GFR after adjustment for demographic and 
hemodynamic factors. In addition, there was reduced LV myo-
cardial deformation and increased aortic stiffness. There was 
no effect on atherosclerosis progression as measured by carotid 
intima-media thickness. The prevalence of microalbuminuria 
and detectable cardiac troponin increased after donation, and 
there was a significant rise in hsCRP. These findings provide 
insight into the pathophysiological effects of CKD on the car-
diovascular system, suggesting that they are not primarily ath-
erosclerotic but instead mediated via myocardial hypertrophy 
and increased large artery stiffness.
Despite robust epidemiological evidence of an association 
between reduced eGFR and increased cardiovascular risk,1 
clear proof of causation has been lacking. The debate has 
been heightened by an increasing body of opinion, suggest-
ing that early stage CKD is benign and that age-related neph-
ron loss should not be medicalized.28 Distinguishing causality 
from association in CKD is made difficult by the numerous 
concomitant diseases that accompany reduced GFR including 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and dyslipidemia. By 
studying kidney donors, we were able to examine prospectively

the effect of a reduction in kidney function on the cardiovas-
cular system, free from such confounding disease processes. 
The results suggest that reduced GFR is an independent graded 
risk factor for adverse LV remodeling independent of blood 
pressure. Because the prevalence of early stage CKD is high 
 
(1 in 7 people in the United States),29 it may be a major cause 
of increased LV mass in the community, a potent risk factor for 
cardiovascular death and adverse events.30 Further investiga-
tion is required to identify the mediators of renal cardiovas-
cular disease. We have found no evidence to support effects 
mediated by blood pressure or activation of the renin–angio-
tensin system. Uric acid, PTH, and fibroblast growth factor-23 
all require further investigation as mediators of both increased 
ventricular mass and arterial stiffening.31,32
Our findings may have clinical implications as all of the 
variables examined are of prognostic importance. Both LV 
mass and aortic stiffness have been consistently associated 
with increased mortality in both the general population16,33 and 
in patients with CKD.8,34 Although no subject in the current 
study reached criteria for LV hypertrophy, both LV mass and 
mass:volume ratio have continuous rather than dichotomous 
relationships with risk.35 Indeed, LV mass is second only to 
age in its ability to predict cardiovascular events, cardiovas-
cular death, and total mortality.36 Detectable troponin also 
independently predicts both total and cardiovascular mortality 
in healthy adults,37,38 and adverse cardiovascular events in sub-
jects with CKD.39 Furthermore, there is a strong independent 
association between hsCRP and mortality in healthy subjects, 
as well as in the nondialysis CKD population.40,41 The lack 
of an increase in circulating NTpro-BNP (normally secreted 
in response to increased wall tension) is perhaps unexpected 
given the degree of adverse LV remodeling, but may be the 
result of a compensatory increase in wall thickness normal-
izing wall stress.42 When considering the clinical implications 
of our findings, it should be noted that few donors reached an 
eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m2, a level at which excess cardiovas-
cular risk rises sharply.43
The practice of living kidney donation is expanding rap-
idly; to date >135 000 such procedures have been performed 
in the United States alone.44 Although observational studies of 
kidney donors have been reassuring with adverse event rates 
lower than those of the general population,45,46 studies using 
highly selected healthy control groups suggest that there may 
be a small increase in the risk of cardiovascular events and 
in the risk of developing end-stage CKD, particularly in non-
white ethnic groups.47,48 Our results provide insight into the 
potential mechanisms by which adverse cardiovascular effects 
of kidney donation may be mediated and extend those which 
have been presented in the only other prospective, controlled 
pathophysiological study of kidney donors to date.49 Kasiske 
et al49 also found no effect of kidney donation on peripheral 
blood pressure, but recorded similar biochemical effects 
including an increase in PTH and uric acid. Both these factors 
have been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes 
and may themselves have direct adverse effects on LV geom-
etry.50,51 The lack of change in hsCRP in donors reported by 
Kasiske et al49 is in contrast to our findings.47 Our own donor 
cohort had a higher mean age (47±12 versus 43±12 years) and 
included twice the proportion of non-white subjects (10% ver-
sus 5%), which could explain this discrepancy.
The strengths of our study include its prospective blinded 
end point design, the selection of similar donors and controls, 
and the high recruitment rate, but there are some limitations. 
First, the study was not randomized, which may have intro-
duced bias although randomized trials of donation would never 
be possible for ethical reasons. Second, although over one half 
of all subjects approached (57%) took part in the study, we can-
not exclude the potential for selection bias. Third, the use of 
Figure 2. Spread of 12-mo change in left ventricular 
mass among donors vs controls. There was a 
significant increase in left ventricular mass in 
donors vs controls at 12 mo with a mean difference 
in the change >12 mo of 9.8 g (95% confidence 
interval, 6.2–13.3; P<0.001).

nonsurgical controls means that we cannot exclude the possibil-
ity that other factors related to surgery may have exerted adverse 
cardiovascular effects. Fourth, most donors included were white 
(90%) and whether similar adverse changes in LV structure and 
function occur in non-white donors requires further assessment. 
Finally, our study was not large enough, or of sufficient duration 
to provide data on the risk of adverse outcomes.
Perspectives
Compared with healthy controls, kidney donors exhibited 
adverse changes in LV mass and systolic function, aortic 
stiffness, and cardiovascular disease biomarker profile at 12 
months after donation. The increase in LV mass was indepen-
dently related to changes in kidney function but independent 
of blood pressure. These findings suggest that reduced renal 
function should be regarded as an independent causative car-
diovascular risk factor.

What Is New?
• Even early stage chronic kidney disease is associated with an increased 
risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but it has been difficult to 
know whether this is caused directly by reduced renal function or results 
from the clustering of risk factors that invariably accompany chronic 
kidney disease, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. We have 
shown that the modest reduction in renal function caused by kidney do-
nation is associated with increased left ventricular mass and increased 
arterial stiffness without a change in blood pressure.
What Is Relevant?
• Reduced renal function is associated with adverse left ventricular remod-
eling. As mild chronic kidney disease is common, it may be a frequent 
cause of left ventricular hypertrophy and elevated cardiovascular risk in 
the community. Kidney donation may confer elevated cardiovascular risk 
although this is still likely to be less than that of the general population.
Summary
This study provides strong evidence that a reduction in glomerular 
filtration rate is independently associated with adverse effects on 
the myocardium and large arteries.
