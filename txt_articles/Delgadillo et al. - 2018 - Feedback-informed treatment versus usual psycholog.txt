Summary  
Background: Previous research suggests that using outcome feedback technology 
can enable psychological therapists to identify and resolve obstacles to clinical 
improvement. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an outcome 
feedback quality assurance system applied in stepped care psychological services. 
Methods: This multi-site cluster randomised controlled trial (registration DOI: 
10.1186/ISRCTN12459454) included 2233 patients with depression and anxiety 
disorders accessing at least 2 sessions of individual psychological therapy 
delivered by 77 therapists across 8 healthcare organisations. Therapists were 
randomised to a feedback intervention group (N = 39) or a treatment-as-usual 
control group (N = 38). The feedback technology alerted therapists to cases that 
were “not on track”, and primed them to review these in clinical supervision. Post-
treatment symptom severity on validated depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) 
measures was compared between groups using multilevel modelling, controlling 
for cluster (therapist) effects, following an intention-to-treat approach. 
Findings: Cases classified as not on track had significantly less severe symptoms 
after treatment if they were allocated to the feedback group (PHQ-9 d = 0.23, B = -
1.03 [95% CI = -1.84, -0.23], p = 0.012; GAD-7 d = 0.19, B = -0.85 [95% CI = -1.56, 
-0.14], p = 0.019). There were no between-group differences in the odds of reliable 
improvement (OR = 1.32 [0.93, 1.89], p = 0.12); however, control cases classed as 
not on track had significantly greater odds of reliable deterioration (OR = 1.73 [1.18, 
2.54], p = 0.0050). 
Interpretation: Supplementing psychological therapy with low-cost feedback 
technology prevents deterioration in cases at risk of poor response to treatment. 
This evidence supports the implementation of outcome feedback in stepped care 
psychological services.

Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
Previous research suggests that using inexpensive quality improvement strategies 
such as routine outcome monitoring and feedback can improve psychological 
treatment outcomes, in particular for cases that are prone to deterioration. The 
generalisability of previous trials is limited by their application in specialist 
university or psychotherapy clinics, and observational studies in primary care were 
likely to be statistically underpowered. 
Added value of this study 
This large-scale, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial was adequately powered 
to detect small effect size differences, and designed to evaluate the generalisability 
of feedback effects across multiple primary care psychological therapy services.  
Implications of all the available evidence 
There is now a compelling evidence base to support the implementation of outcome 
monitoring and feedback technologies in mainstream psychological services. 
Implementing this low-cost, automated feedback and quality assurance system 
can help to prevent deterioration for cases that are at risk of poor treatment 
outcomes.

Introduction 
A number of psychological interventions, ranging from brief guided self-help to 
more intensive psychotherapies, are effective for the treatment of depression and 
anxiety disorders.1 Large-scale evaluations of such treatments applied in routine 
care are generally favourable, although it is also known that at least 30% of 
patients do not show statistically reliable improvement and some deteriorate.2-3 
Previous studies have shown that patients at risk of poor response to treatment 
can be identified early using outcome feedback methods.4 Outcome feedback is a 
quality assurance method which involves routinely monitoring a patient’s 
condition using standardised measures which are compared to data from a 
normative clinical sample.5 Using data charts or automated electronic monitoring 
technologies, cases that are “not on track” are detected when their symptoms are 
significantly worse than those of similar cases.  
Several reviews of experimental and practice-based studies suggest that 
using outcome feedback can help to improve treatment outcomes by comparison 
to usual psychological care.4,6-8 Simply collecting patient-reported outcome 
measures in clinical practice is not associated with improved outcomes,9 so it is 
plausible that the “risk signal” element of feedback technologies serves to 
effectively prompt therapists to identify and to resolve obstacles to improvement. 
This mechanism of action is supported by evidence from controlled trials where  
therapy supported with risk signalling yielded better outcomes than routine 
psychological care.6-8 An early meta-analysis suggested that supplementing the 
signal with clinical decision-making and support tools further enhances its 
effectiveness,6 although a more recent meta-analysis contradicts this finding.9 It 
has also been proposed that outcome feedback specifically helps to prevent 
deterioration in cases classed as not on track.6-8 A recent systematic review of the 
literature concluded that studies that applied risk signalling technology show some 
 5 
 
 
evidence of improved outcomes for not on track cases, but the effect sizes were 
small (standardised mean difference of -0.22).9 Furthermore, some studies have 
not found a differential effect of feedback in the not on track subgroup10-12 and one 
study found that using feedback possibly deteriorates outcomes for not on track 
cases with cluster B personality disorders.13  
Overall, the literature shows mixed and inconclusive evidence for the use of 
feedback technologies, and the methodological quality of studies has been rated 
as generally low.9 This variability raises questions about the generalisability of 
feedback, justifying the need to carefully evaluate its acceptability, feasibility and 
effectiveness prior to adoption in routine care.14 Some studies have suggested that 
outcome feedback may be particularly helpful in short-term evidence-based 
therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy, and could enhance the efficiency 
of treatment.10,11 A recent study reported qualitative evidence that feedback-
assisted brief psychological interventions were acceptable to patients with 
depression and anxiety disorders, and feasible to implement in a routine primary 
care setting.11 This study also suggested that outcome feedback could reduce the 
cost and enhance the efficiency of treatment, although it was limited by the use of 
historical control group data in a non-randomized design. In spite of these 
promising results, more rigorous experimental evidence is necessary to establish 
the generalisability and efficacy of feedback in primary care settings. The present 
study aimed to address this gap in the literature through a multi-site randomised 
controlled trial applied in primary care psychological services for common mental 
health problems.

Methods 
Study design 
This was a pragmatic, multi-site, cluster randomised controlled trial. The objective 
was to assess the clinical effect of feedback-assisted psychological treatments, in 
comparison to routinely delivered psychological care. The central hypothesis was 
that using feedback would result in lower mean symptom severity for not on track 
cases, in comparison to usual care. The primary outcome was depression and 
anxiety symptom severity assessed at the last treatment session using validated 
patient-reported outcome measures described below. Secondary outcomes 
included work and social adjustment, treatment duration, reliable improvement, 
reliable deterioration, treatment dropout rates and the percentage of cases 
classified as not on track. 
The design involved randomising participating therapists (and all of their 
patients meeting inclusion criteria described below) to a feedback intervention 
group or a treatment-as-usual control group. The rationale for this design was two-
fold. First, randomising therapists would minimise the risk of contamination of 
controls through practice effects, which could occur if the same therapist were to 
treat some patients with and others without using outcome feedback technology. 
Secondly, this cluster design adequately represents the natural nesting of patients 
within therapists, thus enabling us to control for variability in outcomes 
attributable to therapists (therapist effects15). 
Using the Optimal Design Software for Multi-level and Longitudinal 
Research (Version 3.01)16, we estimated that a minimum of 60 therapists (30 per 
group) –each of whom treated an average of 10 patients– was required to detect a 
small effect size with an alpha level of � = 0.05 and 80% power. This calculation 
assumed an intracluster correlation coefficient of ICC = 0.05, guided by previous 
 7 
 
 
studies investigating therapist effects in naturalistic samples.15,17 We aimed to 
recruit up to 80 therapists to account for attrition. 
The study was approved by the London - City & East NHS Research Ethics 
Committee (06/01/2016, Ref: 15/LO/2200) and the protocol was registered in an 
international database prior to recruitment (DOI: 10.1186/ISRCTN12459454). 
 
Setting and interventions 
The study was conducted in eight National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in 
England. Together, these services covered a large primary care population across 
London, Cambridge, Cheshire & Wirral, Bury, Heywood, Middleton, Rochdale, 
Oldham, Stockport, Tameside & Glossop, Trafford, Barnsley, and East Riding.  
All participating services were part of the national Improving Access to 
Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme, which offers protocol-driven, evidence-
based psychological interventions for depression and anxiety disorders organised 
in a stepped care model.18 Low intensity guided self-help based on principles of 
cognitive behavioural therapy (LiCBT) was offered as an initial treatment in most 
cases with mild-to-moderate depression and/or anxiety problems. LiCBT is 
delivered by trained coaches (psychological wellbeing practitioners) in a variety of 
different formats (e.g., individual or group psychoeducation, computerised CBT 
with telephone support) and typically lasts under 8 sessions. Those with more 
severe or complex problems, and those who did not respond to LiCBT were 
“stepped up” to high intensity (up to 20 sessions) psychotherapies including CBT, 
interpersonal psychotherapy, and counselling for depression. The specific 
treatment recommendation for each case followed standard clinical guidelines.19 
Treatment was supported by regular (weekly or fortnightly) clinical supervision 
delivered in a peer-supervision model organised within each service.

Participants 
Therapists qualified to deliver low or high intensity interventions were eligible to 
take part, with the exception of (1) therapists with short-term employment 
contracts or (2) trainees who were not yet fully qualified. The trial included all 
patients that accessed individual (low and/or high intensity) therapy with 
participating therapists, excluding patients who accessed group therapies and 
those who attended less than 2 individual therapy sessions. The latter condition 
was applied because: (1) outcome measures for patients that accessed 1 session 
reflect symptom severity for a pre-treatment period of 2 weeks, and (2) the outcome 
feedback technology requires at least 2 sessions to provide a progress feedback 
signal taking session 1 as a baseline score. The allocation of patients to therapists 
in routine care was quasi-random, where patients on waiting list were allocated 
sequentially based on therapist availability. 
 
Outcome feedback quality assurance system 
Therapists in all participating services routinely recorded their patients’ 
clinical outcomes using an electronic clinical record system called Patient Case 
Management Information System (PCMIS; http://www.pc-mis.co.uk). PCMIS 
includes outcome monitoring graphs which chart depression and anxiety symptom 
severity scores at every session. Therapists randomised to the experimental group 
had access to enhanced outcome monitoring graphs which included expected 
treatment response curves. The expected treatment response curves represent 80% 
prediction intervals, which are estimated using growth curve modelling in data 
from a normative clinical sample.5,20-21 Expected treatment response curves were 
calculated for subgroups of cases with the same baseline symptom severity, using 
a large clinical dataset of cases treated in IAPT (further details described 
elsewhere22). These enhanced outcome monitoring graphs automatically generated 
 9 
 
 
a “red signal” to alert therapists to not on track cases whose depression and/or 
anxiety symptoms surpassed the 80% upper boundary of the expected treatment 
response curves. Control group therapists only had access to standard outcome 
tracking graphs, but without expected treatment response curves or automated 
risk signals. 
Therapists randomised to the feedback group attended a standardised 6.5-
hour training programme which covered: outcome feedback theory and evidence-
base; instructions on how to use the feedback tool; clinical trouble-shooting skills. 
The training required therapists to follow the following process: (1) review outcome 
feedback graphs with patients at the start of every session; (2) if the graph shows 
a risk signal, discuss this with the patient to collaboratively identify potential 
obstacles to improvement; (3) prioritise discussing not on track cases with your 
clinical supervisor; (4) use information from points 2 and 3 to develop a plan to 
address obstacles; (5) use outcome feedback graphs to assess how your plan is 
working. Therapists were also primed to be aware of variables that have been 
empirically shown to be associated with treatment outcomes (patient, therapist, 
process, and wider context factors). This information and evidence-base was 
synthesised in a clinical guideline that therapists assigned to the feedback group 
received after training.23  
 
Outcome measures and secondary data 
Patients accessing the participating services routinely self-completed standardised 
outcome measures before each session; the measures obtained at the last 
treatment session were taken as primary outcomes in the trial. The Patient Health 
Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is a nine-item screening tool for depression, where each 
item is rated on a 0 to 3 scale, yielding a total depression severity score between 
 10 
 
 
0–27.24 A cut-off ≥ 10 has been recommended to screen for major depression,24 
and a difference of ≥6 points between assessments is indicative of reliable change.25  
The Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) is a seven-item 
measure developed to screen for anxiety disorders.26 It is also rated using a 0 to 3 
scale, yielding a total anxiety severity score between 0–21. A cut-off score ≥8 is 
recommended to identify the likely presence of a diagnosable anxiety disorder,26 
and a difference of ≥5 points is indicative of reliable change.25 
 
Secondary data sources included demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, 
employment status), stepped care pathway information, number of treatment 
sessions, primary diagnoses recorded in clinical records and functional 
impairment measured using the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS).27  
 
Recruitment, randomisation and data collection 
Recruitment took place between January and July 2016. A participant information 
sheet and consent form were shared via email with all therapists working in 
participating services. Therapists had an opportunity to clarify questions with the 
principal investigator before providing signed consent forms directly to the 
research team. Parallel-group random allocation was independently performed by 
a researcher using a computer-generated (1:1) randomisation algorithm to prevent 
selection bias within services. Given the nature of the outcome feedback 
technology, this was an open-label trial where therapists were aware of their 
allocation. Session-by-session depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) outcome 
measures were collected for all eligible patients who accessed individual therapy 
with participating therapists during a one-year study period.

Data analysis 
Patients’ characteristics were compared between groups (those included and 
excluded from the trial sample) using Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous 
variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. A small number of cases 
(N = 98; 4.4% of the trial sample) had missing post-treatment outcome measures 
which were imputed by averaging the imputed values from 25 estimated datasets 
using an expectation maximization method.28 This imputation was carried out so 
that we could conduct intention-to-treat analyses, including post-treatment 
outcomes for all cases regardless of completion or dropout status. 
 
The primary analysis was carried out using multilevel modelling (MLM) with 
separate models for PHQ-9 and GAD-7 outcomes. Following conventional model 
building guidelines,29 we initially examined the hierarchical structure of the 
dataset using unconditional models predicting post-treatment symptom severity. 
The “site” variable was not statistically significant in a three-level model (patients 
within therapists within sites), so subsequent analyses used two-level models 
(patients within therapists). Next, we considered different covariance structures, 
assessed non-linear (i.e., quadratic, log-linear) trends in the number of treatment 
sessions, and assessed goodness-of-fit (using AIC, BIC, −2 log likelihood statistics). 
After initial model checking, the primary analysis applied a two�level model, 
including random intercepts for therapists, with an unstructured covariance 
matrix, and an identity link-function. No cases included in the trial sample had 
two interventions delivered by different therapists (e.g., low followed by high 
intensity therapy), so crossed random effects were not modelled. Continuous 
variables were grand-mean centred and an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) 
was calculated to assess the proportion of variance in outcomes attributable to 
therapists. An initial conditional model included the following predictors: baseline 
severity of symptoms, log transformed number of sessions, and group (feedback 
 12 
 
 
vs. control), which compared between-group differences in post-treatment 
symptom severity. Next, a fully adjusted model additionally included a case 
classification (case classified as on track vs. not on track), and a group * 
classification interaction term (main hypothesis test). This MLM strategy was 
repeated in a sensitivity analysis controlling for age and step of care (low vs. high 
intensity treatment). 
Secondary analyses assessed other relevant clinical outcomes. The fully 
adjusted MLM was repeated using the WSAS as a dependent variable to assess 
potential effects of feedback on functional impairment. Poisson MLM was used to 
compare between-group differences in treatment duration, controlling for baseline 
PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Logistic MLM was used to compare between-group probabilities 
(odds ratios) of meeting post-treatment criteria for reliable improvement (RI), after 
controlling for baseline severity (PHQ-9 and GAD-7). The RI classification required 
patients to have statistically reliable improvement in at least one of the outcome 
measures, as long as the other measure did not show reliable deterioration. 
Logistic MLM was also used to estimate between-group odds ratios for the % of 
cases with reliable deterioration (in at least one outcome measure), the percentage 
of cases classed as not on track, and the percentage of cases that dropped-out of 
treatment. These models were computed using the full sample and repeated in the 
not on track subsample. 
 
Role of the funding source 
The study was partly supported by research capability funding awarded by the 
English National Health Service (NHS) and partly funded by a visiting research 
fellowship awarded to the principal investigator by the Department of Health 
Sciences, University of York. The funding organisations had no role in the decision 
to publish the study.

Results 
Sample characteristics 
In total, 79 therapists were recruited but 2 did not participate (see Figure 1). Of 
the 77 participating therapists, 39 (50.6%) were randomised to the feedback group 
and 38 (49.4%) to the control group. Of these, 48 (62.3%) delivered high intensity 
CBT, 23 (29.9%) delivered low intensity CBT, and 6 (7.8%) delivered counselling 
for depression. Most therapists were females (84.4%) from a white British 
background (84.4%), with an average of 7 years’ experience in delivering 
psychological interventions (range = 9 months to 31 years). The number of trial 
cases treated by each therapist ranged between 1 and 113 (median = 25, mean = 
30.77, SD = 24.54). Further sample characteristics are summarised in Table 1. 
Altogether, 2233 patients meeting case selection criteria described above 
were included in the trial (1176 feedback cases, 1057 controls). According to 
clinical records, 34.5% had a primary affective disorder (major depression episode, 
recurrent depression), 14.2% had mixed anxiety and depression disorder, 14.6% 
had generalized anxiety disorder, 6.0% had post-traumatic stress disorder, and 
other anxiety problems were less prevalent. The mean number of weekly therapy 
sessions was 6.45 (SD = 3.67, median = 6, range = 2 to 25) in the full study sample; 
6.35 (SD = 3.60, median = 6, range = 2 to 25) in the control group and 6.54 (SD = 
3.73, median = 6, range = 2 to 22) in the OF group. Demographics and clinical 
characteristics are summarised in Table 1.  
The trial sample excluded 651 cases that did not access individual therapy 
(e.g., group psycho-education cases) or who only attended a single session. 
Excluded cases had similar baseline characteristics compared to trial cases, but a 
higher proportion of unemployed patients (22.3% vs. 18.1%; p = 0.040) and 
marginally higher baseline PHQ-9 scores (mean difference = 0.35; p = 0.007).

Primary analysis 
The main effect for trial group was not statistically significant in the initial 
conditional models testing between-group differences (shown in supplementary 
appendix), nor in the fully adjusted models testing interaction terms (shown in 
Table 2). The negative coefficients for the group * classification interaction terms 
indicated that not on track cases tended to have lower post-treatment symptoms if 
they were in the feedback group, as depicted in Figure 2. The interaction was 
statistically significant in the depression model (B = -1.03, SE = 0.41, p = 0.012), 
and in the anxiety model (B = -0.85, SE = 0.36, p = 0.019). Approximately 11% of 
variability in depression (ICC = 0.107) and anxiety (ICC = 0.114) outcomes was 
attributable to therapist effects. Effect size differences between groups were PHQ-
9 d = 0.17 and GAD-7 d = 0.13 in the whole sample (N = 2233); the corresponding 
values in the not on track subsample (N = 1288) were PHQ-9 d = 0.23 and GAD-7 
d = 0.19. Sensitivity MLM analyses controlling for age and intensity of treatment 
(low vs. high) confirmed the same results (see supplementary appendix).

Secondary analyses 
The fully adjusted MLM results using WSAS as a dependent variable followed the 
same pattern as described above. The main effect for group was not significant (B 
= 0.46, SE = 0.77, p = 0.55), but the group * classification interaction term was 
statistically significant (B = -1.75, SE = 0.62, p = 0.0050) yielding an effect size of 
d = 0.22 in the not on track subgroup. The poisson MLM results indicated no 
significant differences in treatment duration between groups (B = -0.05, SE = 0.05, 
p = 0.37); and no significant group * classification interaction (B = -0.02, SE = 0.04, 
p = 0.62). Full outputs from these MLM analyses are in the supplementary 
appendix.  
Table 3 summarises indices of clinical effectiveness. MLM results controlling 
for therapist effects indicated that there were no significant between-group 
differences in the odds of reliable improvement in the full sample (OR = 1.21, p = 
0.29) or in the not on track subsample (OR = 1.32, p = 0.12). However, control cases 
had greater odds of reliable deterioration (full sample OR = 1.48, p = 0.023; not on 
track subsample OR = 1.73, p = 0.0050). There were no significant between-group 
differences in the odds of treatment dropout or of being classed as not on track.

Discussion 
Findings in context 
This large-scale, multi-site trial conducted in stepped care IAPT services 
demonstrated that using low-cost outcome feedback technology can improve 
outcomes for cases that are at risk of poor response to treatment. No main effect 
of feedback was found overall; instead an interaction effect indicated that feedback 
is specifically helpful for cases classified as not on track. These findings are largely 
 16 
 
 
consistent with reviews and meta-analyses of previous trials in university and 
outpatient psychotherapy centres, which conclude that the effect of feedback is 
mostly observed in not on track cases,4,6,8,9 although there are also exceptions such 
as the trial by Amble et al.12 which found main effects for feedback in the full 
sample but not in the not on track subgroup. Effect sizes of d = 0.23 for depression, 
d = 0.19 for anxiety, and d = 0.22 for work and social adjustment favouring the 
feedback group were observed. These effect sizes are small by conventional 
standards, but nevertheless remarkable considering the automated nature of the 
risk signalling technology and the low cost incurred by services in requiring 
outcome feedback users to attend a single-day training session. In addition, given 
that the feedback intervention prioritises clinical supervision resources for not on 
track cases, it is important to highlight that this did not disadvantage the on track 
cases in terms of clinical outcomes or dropout rates. Overall, this low-cost quality 
assurance system effectively integrates the use of routine outcome measures, 
outcome prediction technology and clinical supervision. 
Given that usual treatment in IAPT stepped care services utilises standard 
outcome tracking charts and regular clinical supervision, we might expect modest 
effect size differences when supplementing this with risk signalling technology. 
Usual care (control) cases had higher rates of deterioration compared to feedback 
cases, although the odds ratios in this trial (full sample OR = 1.48; not on track 
subsample OR = 1.73) were lower by comparison to the OR = 2.3 reported in the 
meta-analysis by Shimokawa et al.6 This difference may be influenced by the low 
base rate of cases with reliable deterioration in the participating services (<7.5%), 
whereas other psychotherapy settings have typically observed deterioration rates 
in the order of 10%.1 This is plausibly explained by differences in case-mix, since 
IAPT services mostly support people with mild-to-moderate mental health 
problems.18 
 17 
 
 
Contrary to recent studies applying evidence-based CBT interventions,10-11 
we found no significant effects of feedback on treatment duration. One 
methodological explanation could be that prior quasi-experimental studies did not 
have contemporaneous controls, and their effects on duration could be explained 
by other unmeasured factors that changed over time. An alternative explanation 
could be that the inclusion of counselling and LiCBT interventions in the present 
trial may have obscured effects that may be specific to conventional CBT. The 
potential influence of feedback on treatment duration and costs requires further 
investigation. 
 
Strengths and limitations 
The inclusion of services across diverse regions in England is a key strength of this 
study, offering compelling evidence of generalisability in contrast to earlier single-
centre pilot studies.11,30 The risk signalling technology was developed using 
historical data from a service and region that did not take part in this trial,11 thus 
offering a strong test of the generalisability and predictive power of the outcome 
feedback model. The study was adequately powered to detect a small effect and to 
control for therapist effects. The latter feature is an important advance, confirming 
that the use of feedback technology improves response rates after accounting for 
variations in therapeutic aptitude across multiple practitioners. It should be noted 
that the therapist effect estimate (approximately 11%) in this study explains a 
considerably larger proportion of variance than the effect of feedback, so attention 
to the factors that characterise underperforming therapists is clearly warranted. It 
is, of course, plausible that some therapists may make better use of feedback than 
others, and future studies could investigate the personal attitudes, skills or 
organisational conditions that optimise adequate use of feedback.31-33

Some limitations should also be borne in mind when interpreting the 
present results. Although we included a sizeable group of therapists delivering a 
range of low and high intensity interventions, our study participants nevertheless 
volunteered to take part in the trial. We did not have information about the total 
size or professional characteristics of the workforce across all participating 
services, so we cannot assume that trial therapists are necessarily representative 
of the wider workforce. Furthermore, we did not have the resources to closely 
monitor competence in treatment delivery or in feedback utilisation. A central 
feature of this feedback model involves discussing risk signals with patients and 
clinical supervisors; however, we did not have objective data to assess the extent 
to which these features were adhered to. A further methodological issue relates to 
potential ceiling effects. Cases with high baseline severity scores (e.g., PHQ-9 ≥ 22) 
whose symptoms increased during treatment could not be classified as showing 
“reliable deterioration”, which is mostly an artefact of the measurement tools and 
reliable change indices used in the study. It is therefore possible that the true 
extent of reliable deterioration rates could be underestimated. In addition, like 
most other feedback studies conducted to date,8 this trial only had a short-term 
observation period since outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment. It is 
therefore unknown if the observed effects of feedback may have a durable impact 
on longer-term symptoms and functioning. 
 
Conclusions 
We found generalisable evidence that supplementing psychological therapy with a 
low-cost quality assurance system using outcome feedback technology helps to 
prevent deterioration in cases that are particularly prone to poor treatment 
outcomes.
