Hepatic fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis determines patient prognosis; 
however, effective treatment for fibrosis has not been established. Oxidative stress and inflammation 
activate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and promote fibrosis. In contrast, cellular senescence inhibits 
HSCs’ activity and limits fibrosis. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of IGF-I on NASH and 
cirrhotic models and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. We demonstrate that IGF-I significantly 
ameliorated steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in a NASH model, methionine-choline-deficient 
diet-fed db/db mice and ameliorated fibrosis in cirrhotic model, dimethylnitrosamine-treated mice. As 
the underlying mechanisms, IGF-I improved oxidative stress and mitochondrial function in the liver. In 
addition, IGF-I receptor was strongly expressed in HSCs and IGF-I induced cellular senescence in HSCs 
in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, in mice lacking the key senescence regulator p53, IGF-I did not induce 
cellular senescence in HSCs or show any effects on fibrosis. Taken together, these results indicate that 
IGF-I induces senescence of HSCs, inactivates these cells and limits fibrosis in a p53-dependent manner 
and that IGF-I may be applied to treat NASH and cirrhosis.
NASH is a common liver disease that is characterized histologically by hepatic steatosis, lobular inflammation, 
and hepatocellular ballooning in the absence of a history of significant alcohol use or other known liver disease1. 
The prevalence of NASH has been increasing rapidly world-wide2. NASH is a serious disease because it progresses 
to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and a specific treatment has not been established, particularly for 
the fibrosis2. Furthermore, liver cirrhosis is caused by not only by NASH but also by viral hepatitis, autoimmune 
hepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis and the degree of fibrosis determines prognosis, development of effica-
cious treatment for fibrosis is crucial.
The progression of NASH has been explained using the ‘two-hit’ model3. The first hit is the development of 
fatty liver in the context of obesity and consequent insulin resistance. The second hit encompasses the interplay 
between oxidative stress and inflammation, resulting in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which are 
key players in fibrosis3. HSCs receive a wide range of signals from injured hepatocytes and the perturbed hepatic 
microenvironment, most of which are mediated by cytokines. HSCs are highly responsive to pro-inflammatory 
cytokines and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), resulting in the activation, proliferation, and production of extracel-
lular matrix, which is a hallmark of the fibrotic scar. Although the inhibitory mechanisms of HSCs are largely 
unknown, it has been reported that cellular senescence of activated HSCs limits liver fibrosis4. In mice lacking 
the key senescence regulator p53, cellular senescence in HSCs was not induced, leading to excessive liver fibrosis; 
however, the regulator of senescence remains unknown.
Growth hormone (GH) plays an essential role in adults as in adult patients with GH deficiency, visceral adi-
posity, abnormal lipid profile, insulin resistance, and increased prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) are observed5–7. GH induces insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) production mainly in the liver and 
regulates metabolism through its direct and indirect actions via IGF-I7,8. GH-deficient rats exhibited NASH and 
administration of GH or IGF-I restored these liver damages, indicating that IGF-I plays an important role in 
the liver9. Interestingly, oxidative stress was enhanced and mitochondrial function was impaired in the rats and

administration of GH or IGF-I ameliorated these changes. In humans, patients with adult GH deficiency showed 
an increased prevalence of NAFLD/NASH and GH replacement therapy improved the liver both biochemically 
and histologically5,10. Furthermore, serum IGF-I levels were found to be decreased in patients with NAFLD11 and 
decreased IGF-I levels were associated with inflammation and fibrosis12,13, suggesting that a decrease in serum 
IGF-I levels may play a role in the development of NAFLD/NASH in a general population.
It has been suggested that IGF-I may be beneficial in the treatment of liver cirrhosis14. Systemic administra-
tion of IGF-I improved nutritional status and liver function, and improved fibrosis in a Carbon tetrachloride 
(CCl4)-induced cirrhotic animal model15–18. It has also been reported that forced expression or administration of 
IGF-I in a cirrhotic animal model increased food intake19, reduced portal pressure, improved endotoxemia, bacte-
rial translocation20, and fibrosis15,20,21. These effects were associated with the antioxidant, antiapoptotic, antifibro-
genic, and mitochondrial-protective effects of IGF-I22,23, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Here, 
we investigated the effect of IGF-I on NASH and cirrhotic animal models and demonstrate IGF-I ameliorated 
steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. In addition, we show a novel action of IGF-I on HSCs as the underlying 
mechanisms.
Results
IGF-I administration ameliorated NASH. 
To test the beneficial effect of IGF-I on a NASH mouse model, 
we administered recombinant human IGF-I for 1 month by using osmotic pump on methionine-choline-deficient 
diet-fed db/db mice (MCD-db/db). The serum human IGF-I concentration was comparable to that of endogenous 
IGF-I concentration (Supplemental Fig. 1a,b). During IGF-I treatment, there were no significant changes in body 
weight as compared with the control group (Supplemental Fig. 2a). In the IGF-I treatment group, glucose toler-
ance and insulin sensitivity (Fig. 1a) were improved. In addition, the area of visceral adipose tissue was signifi-
cantly decreased in the IGF-I treatment group (Fig. 1b). The concentrations of liver enzymes tended to decrease 
by IGF-I treatment (Table 1). Interestingly, the hepatic steatosis demonstrated by hematoxylin and eosin staining 
and Oil red-O staining (Fig. 1c) was markedly improved in the IGF-I treatment group. Tissue triglyceride content 
was significantly decreased by IGF-I treatment (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, the number of cells showing ballooning 
necrosis was decreased (Fig. 1d) and the fibrotic area visualized by Masson-trichrome staining was decreased 
(Fig. 1e) in the IGF-I treatment group compared with the control group. Quantitative analysis by realtime PCR 
(Fig. 1f) demonstrated that expression of the macrophage markers Cd68 and F4/80, inflammation markers 
 
Il-1β and Il-6, and fibrotic markers Procollagen 1a1 and Collagen 4a1 were significantly decreased in the IGF-I 
treatment group. The immunohistochemical analysis using anti-Ly-6C and CD68 antibodies (Fig. 1g) showed a 
significant decrease in the number of positive cells in the IGF-I-treated group. These data clearly demonstrate the 
beneficial effect of IGF-I on steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in this NASH model.
IGF-I improved mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, and inhibited hepatic stellate cell 
function. 
Because mitochondrial dysfunction and the related enhancement of oxidative stress play an impor-
tant role in the development of NASH, we analyzed mitochondrial morphology by using electron microscopy and 
the expression of genes related to mitochondrial function. In liver of the NASH model, as shown in Fig. 2a for 
the control group, the morphology of the mitochondria was markedly deteriorated. The size was heterogeneous 
and the shape was deformed; however, in the IGF-I group, these changes were dramatically improved and the 
mitochondrial area was significantly increased (Fig. 2b). Among the genes related to mitochondrial function, the 
expression of Nrf2 and Sco2 was significantly increased in the IGF-I treatment group (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, the 
levels of marker for oxidative stress 8-OHdG in the liver and serum TBARS levels were significantly decreased in 
the IGF-I treatment group (Fig. 2d,e).
Because HSCs play a crucial role in the development of fibrosis, we analyzed the function of HSCs. 
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a decrease in the number of α 
SMA-positive cells (Fig. 3a,b) by IGF-I 
treatment. Realtime PCR analysis comparably showed a decrease in the expression of activated HSCs markers 
 
(Fig. 3c). Increased Mmp9  expression and decreased Timp1 expression also indicated the inactivation of HSCs. 
In addition, immunohistochemical analysis clearly showed the expression of IGF-IR in the HSCs (Fig. 3d), sug-
gesting a direct effect of IGF-I on HSCs.
Anti-fibrotic effect of IGF-I in cirrhotic model mice. 
Next, we examined the effect of IGF-I on cirrhotic 
model mice treated with DMN. Similar to in the NASH model, IGF-I treatment clearly improved fibrosis (Fig. 3e) 
and decreased expression of activated HSCs markers, αsma and Vimentin, respectively (Fig. 3f), indicating that 
IGF-I ameliorated fibrosis in the cirrhotic model.

IGF-I induced cellular senescence of HSCs in vitro and in vivo. 
Recently, it was reported that cellular 
senescence of HSCs inhibits their function and limits fibrosis4; however, it is unknown which factor regulates cellu-
lar senescence in these cells. Because it has been reported that IGF-I induces cellular senescence in fibroblasts24, we 
hypothesized that IGF-I stimulates cellular senescence of HSCs. We then analyzed the effect of IGF-I on primary 
isolated rat HSCs. Intriguingly, the treatment with IGF-I significantly increased the protein levels of the senes-
cence marker p21 and p53 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4a). We further examined the senescence marker 
senescence-associated β 
-galactosidase (SA-β 
-gal) activity. As shown in Fig. 4b, treatment with IGF-I significantly 
increased the number of SA-β 
-gal-positive cells in HSCs. In addition, we confirmed the similar effect of IGF-I using 
LX2 cells, a human HSCs line25 (Supple Fig. 3a–d). These results indicate that IGF-I induces cellular senescence 
in HSCs in vitro. Furthermore, we examined the effect of IGF-I on cellular senescence in vivo. IGF-I treatment 
significantly increased SA-β 
-gal-positive cells in the NASH model mice (Fig. 4c). The staining of serial sections 
demonstrated that SA-β 
-gal-positive cells were α 
SMA-positive (Fig. 4d), indicating that cellular senescence was 
induced in the activated HSCs. In addition, the number of α 
SMA- and p53-double positive cells was increased by 
IGF-I treatment (Fig. 4e), clearly demonstrating that IGF-I induced cellular senescence of HSCs in vivo.
p53 is necessary for IGF-I–induced cellular senescence and its anti-fibrotic effect. 
It is 
well-known that p53 plays a crucial role in cellular senescence26. We first examined the role of p53 in IGF-I 
induced senescence using primary HSCs from p53-deficient mice. Intriguingly, in contrast to the wild-type HSCs, 
IGF-I could not increase p21 expression p53-deficient HSCs (Fig. 5a) and SA-β 
-GAL activity (Fig. 5b), clearly 
indicating that p53 is necessary for the IGF-I-induced senescence in HSCs. We next analyzed the effect of IGF-I 
on cellular senescence and anti-fibrotic effect using methionine-choline-deficient diet-fed p53-deficient mice. 
Because these mice were lean, the steatotic changes were mild; however, fibrotic changes were clearly observed. 
In wild-type mice, IGF-I significantly decreased the number of α 
SMA-positive cells; however, the number was 
unchanged by IGF-I treatment in p53-deficient mice (Fig. 5c,d). Furthermore, the analysis of serial sections by 
α 
SMA immunostaining and SA-β 
-gal activity revealed that while double-positive cells were increased by IGF-I 
treatment in wild-type mice, there was no effect of IGF-I in p53-deficient mice (Fig. 5e). Finally, we analyzed the 
effect of IGF-I on fibrosis using this mouse model. Intriguingly, treatment with IGF-I significantly ameliorated 
fibrotic changes in wild-type mice; however, IGF-I showed no effect in p53-deficient mice, indicating that the 
anti-fibrotic effect of IGF-I was p53-dependent (Fig. 5f,g).
Discussion
We found that IGF-I ameliorated steatosis, and inflammation in the NASH animal model and exerted an 
anti-fibrotic effect on the NASH and cirrhotic animal models. IGF-I induced cellular senescence in HSCs, thereby 
inactivating these cells and preventing the progression of fibrosis in a p53-dependent manner. While the degree 
of fibrosis determines the prognosis in NASH and liver cirrhosis, efficacious treatment for fibrosis has not been 
established. We demonstrated that IGF-I has a potential therapeutic application for NASH and liver cirrhosis.
It has been reported that GH deficiency, in which hepatic IGF-I production is impaired in adults shows an 
increased prevalence of NASH in rats and humans5,9. GH or IGF-I treatment ameliorated NASH in an animal 
model, indicating that IGF-I plays a pivotal role in a GH-independent manner9. In clinical settings, serum IGF-I 
levels are decreased in patients with NAFLD11 and decreased levels of serum IGF-I are closely associated with the 
severity of fibrosis12. These data also suggest that impaired IGF-I secretion even in the physiological range may be 
causally related to the development of fibrosis in NAFLD. In agreement with this, we showed that IGF-I adminis-
tration targeting a physiological serum level ameliorated the fibrosis. The liver is the main source of serum IGF-I7 
and secreted IGF-I considered to exert its action on various organs in an endocrine fashion. The present data sug-
gest that IGF-I produced by hepatocytes locally acts on HSCs and regulates their function in a paracrine manner.
Several underlying mechanisms of IGF-I action in the liver have been suggested. IGF-I ameliorates liver damage 
 
in rats with GH deficiency concomitant with the improvement in oxidative stress and mitochondrial function, 
which are important factors in the development of NASH. Multiple methods of delivery of IGF-I to the liver in 
the cirrhotic animal models have been shown to improve fibrosis15,21,22. Upregulation of hepatocyte growth factor 
and downregulation of transforming growth factor β 
-1 were observed following IGF-I overexpression22. In the 
present study, we clearly demonstrated that IGF-I induced cellular senescence in HSCs both in vitro and in vivo. 
In mice lacking the key senescence regulator p53, IGF-I did not induce cellular senescence in HSCs and show any 
effect on fibrosis. These results demonstrated a novel mechanism for the anti-fibrotic action of IGF-I in HSCs.
The underlying mechanism that IGF-I induces senescence in HSCs is unknown. Although we have clearly 
shown that p53 is necessary for the IGF-I-induced senescence, it has not been fully elucidated how IGF-I induces 
p53 expression. It has been reported that IGF-I induces cellular senescence in murine and human fibroblast via 
oxidative stress by activating NADPH oxidase24,27, suggesting that IGF-I stimulates intracellular ROS production 
in HSCs, increases p53 expression, and induces senescence in HSCs.
Recently, it has been reported that p53 play a role in not only HSCs but also in hepatocytes in the development 
of NASH28. In the present study, we used mice that were deficient in p53 in whole body, indicating that we cannot 
exclude the indirect influence of p53 deficiency in the other cells or tissues including hepatocytes. However, the 
results of impaired induction in senescence in primary HSCs from p53−/− mice by IGF-I strongly support a pres-
ence of p53-dependent direct action of IGF-I in HSCs.
All patients with NAFLD require advice for life style modifications aimed at weight loss and increased physical 
activity, as well as the treatment of any associated risk factors29. It has been reported that some pharmacothera-
pies directed at the liver are effective for treating NASH. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that pioglitazone 
treatment significantly improved steatosis, inflammation, and to a lesser degree, fibrosis30. Treatment with the 
antioxidant vitamin E improved steatosis and inflammation but not fibrosis31. Thus far, efficacious therapy for

fibrosis has not been established. In this regard, IGF-I treatment is a potential therapeutic option particularly for 
fibrosis via a different mechanism.
A primary concern of clinical application of IGF-I is an increased risk of cancer. According to the present 
data, a physiological, and not pharmacological, range of IGF-I improved fibrosis; however, even in the physio-
logical range, increased serum IGF-I levels were associated with an increased risk of prostate, breast, and colon 
cancer32. The results of cellular and animal models suggest that the IGF-I signaling pathway plays an important 
role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and clinical trials targeting the IGF-I axis with a focus on 
the anti-IGF-IR approach have been conducted33. Careful observation for the development of hepatocellular 
carcinoma is necessary, particularly when IGF-I is used for cirrhosis. Nevertheless, prevention of fibrosis is an 
essential target for the treatment of NASH and cirrhosis34, suggesting a beneficial effect of IGF-I treatment on 
these conditions.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that IGF-I induces senescence of HSCs, inactivates these cells and limits 
fibrosis in a p53-dependent manner and a potential therapeutic application of IGF-I for the treatment of NASH 
and cirrhosis.
Methods
Animal model and experimental design. 
Eight-week-old male ICR mice, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, and 
db/db mice with a C57BL/6 background were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The p53−/− mouse 
strain (RBRC01361) was provided by RIKEN BRC (Tsukuba, Japan) through the National Bio-Resource Project 
of the MEXT, Japan35. Mice and rats were maintained in a temperature-controlled and light-controlled facility 
(12-h light, 12-h dark), and permitted ad libitum consumption of water. Mice were fed methionine-choline-de-
ficient diet (Oriental Yeast Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 6 weeks to establish the NASH model. Dimethylnitrosamine 
(DMN) was injected intraperitoneally in doses of 10 μ 
g per 1 g body weight (diluted 1:2000 with 0.15 M sterile 
NaCl). The injections were given on three consecutive days of each week for a period of 9 weeks. DMN-treated 
animals were sacrificed on days 70 from the beginning of exposure. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane 
(Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd, Osaka, Japan) and nembutal (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL,) 
and osmotic minipumps (model 2004D, Alzet Co., Palo Alto, CA), containing porcine GH (10 mg/mL; NIDDK 
National Hormone and Pituitary Program) or recombinant human IGF-I (10 mg/mL; Astellas Pharma, Co., Ltd., 
Tokyo, Japan), vehicle (saline) were implanted subcutaneously. Four weeks (NASH model) or 6 weeks (cirrhosis 
model) after pump-placement, the mice were sacrificed; a portion of each liver was fixed in 4% paraformalde-
hyde phosphate buffer for histology. Additional samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis 
of liver lipid levels and lipid peroxidation. This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee (Permission number: P120904, P150203) and carried out according to the Kobe University Animal 
Experimentation Regulation.
Computed tomography. 
Twelve-week-old mice were anesthetized with Isoflurane. The percent body fat 
and visceral fat mass ratio of mice were analyzed using Latheta LTC-100 (ALOKA, Tokyo, Japan).
Cell culture and treatments. 
LX-2, an immortalized human HSC line25, was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified 
 
eagle medium (DMEM) containing 2% FBS. The medium was then replaced with serum-free-DMEM containing 
penicillin/streptomycin and glutamine for 24 h before experimentation. Primary HSCs were separated from SD 
rat livers and p53-deficient mice in an inverted gradient as described previously36.
Measurement of plasma and liver biochemical parameters. 
To quantify hepatic triglyceride content, 
the liver was lysed with buffer from a commercially available kit (TG E-test; Wako, Osaka, Japan) and disrupted 
by sonication according to the manufacturer’s instructions37. Tissue 8-OHdG levels were determined using DNA 
Extractor(R) TIS Kit (catalog no. 296-67701, Wako), 8-OHdG Assay Preparation Reagent Set (catalog no. 292-67801, 
 
Wako), and High Sensitive 8-OHdG Check ELISA kit (KOG-HS10E, catalog no. 307-07921, NIKKEN SEIL Co., 
Ltd, Sizuoka, Japan). Blood samples were centrifuged, and serum or plasma was frozen at − 
80 °C for subse-
quent measurement of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), free fatty acid (FFA), 
triglyceride, insulin, IGF-I, and thiobarbituric1 acid-reactive substances (TBARs) levels. AST and ALT levels 
were measured using the transaminase C-II test kit (Wako). FFA and triglyceride levels were measured using 
the nonesterified fatty acid C-test (Wako) and triglyceride E-test (Wako), respectively. Mouse insulin levels 
were measured using the Mouse Insulin ELISA kit (Shibayagi, Gunma, Japan). Human total IGF-I (Quantikine 
Human IGF-I Immunoassay, catalog no. DG100, R&D systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) and mouse/rat total 
IGF-I (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc., Webster, TX, USA) levels were measured using an ELISA or EIA 
kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Serum TBARs level was measured using the TBARS assay kit 
(Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
Western blotting analysis. 
Expressions of phospho-IGF-I receptor (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, 
Inc.), α 
SMA (1:500, Dako, Denmark), p53 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., USA), p21 (1:1000, Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and β 
 actin (1:2000, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) 
were determined using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotting analysis. 
Membrane-bound antibodies were visualized using horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies 
and subsequent ECL detection (Immunostar LD, Wako).
RNA extraction and Quantitative real time PCR. 
Total RNA was extracted from the liver tissue using 
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Five-hundred ng of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by reverse transcription 
with ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (TOYOBO Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed

using the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR was catalyzed 
by SYBR® 
 Premix Ex Taq™ 
 II (TAKARA BIO Inc, Shiga, Japan), while SYBR Green I DNA-binding dye generated 
the fluorescence signals during each of the 40 cycles, in proportion to the quantities of double-stranded DNA. 
The expression levels of all genes were normalized to 18S or GAPDH gene expression level. Each experiment was 
conducted in duplicate and the average was calculated. The sequence of primers used was shown in Supplemental 
Table 1.
Senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining. 
Detection of Senescence-associated β 
-galactosidase 
(SA-β 
-gal) activity was performed at pH = 
 5.5 for mouse/rat tissue and pH = 
 6.0 for human cells as described pre-
viously38. To avoid staining due to cell confluence rather than proliferative senescence39, the assay was performed 
in sub-confluent cultures displaying comparable cell densities.
Histological analysis. 
For routine histology, liver specimens were preserved in 4% paraformaldehyde in 
PBS and dehydrated in a graded alcohol series. Following xylene treatment, the specimens were embedded in par-
affin blocks and cut into 5-μ 
m thick sections, which were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for routine examination 
or with Masson’s trichrome and Sirius Red, and Oil red-O staining. A hepatopathologist who was blinded to the 
experimental conditions examined all sections for steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. To assess hepatic stea-
tosis, the histopathological criteria proposed by Brunt et al. was adopted40–43. The degree of fibrosis was assessed 
by digital morphometry. The number of pixels corresponding to fibrosis was measured as a percentage of the 
total pixels of each image by using NIH Image J software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Immunostaining was per-
formed as previously described44. The following antibodies were used: Ly-6C (1:200, Santa cruz Biotechnology, 
Inc. Texas, USA.), CD68 (1:100, Bioss Inc., Boston, USA), α 
SMA (1:500, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Biotinylated 
anti-goat immunoglobulins (LSAB + 
 System-HRP, Dako) and Peroxidase-conjugated immunepolymer for rab-
bit polyclonal antibodies (Envision-PO for rabbit, Dako) were used for signal detection as secondary antibody. 
AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for immunofluorescent signal detection. All fluorescence 
microscopy was performed in confocal mode (LSM700, Zeiss, Jena, Germany and BZ8100, Keyence, Osaka, 
Japan).
Transmission electron microscopy. 
Liver tissue was cut into small sections, fixed by 1% OsO4 fixative 
solution and observed using a Jeol JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 
Gatan bioscan camera mode l792 and TEM AutoTune™ (Nippon Gatan, Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical analyses. 
Values were expressed as the mean ± 
 SEM. Significance was established using Student’s 
t test or analysis of variance as appropriate. Results were considered to be statistically significant at values of 
p < 0.05.
