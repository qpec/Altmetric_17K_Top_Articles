(HTN) is a prevalent condition with complex etiology and pathophys-
iology. Evidence exists of significant communication between the
nervous system and the immune system (IS), and there appears to be
a direct role for inflammatory bone marrow (BM) cells in the patho-
physiology of hypertension. However, the molecular and neural
mechanisms underlying this interaction have not been characterized.
Here, we transplanted whole BM cells from the beta 1 and 2 adren-
ergic receptor (AdrB1tm1BkkAdrB2tm1Bkk/J) knockout (KO) mice into
near lethally irradiated C57BL/6J mice to generate a BM AdrB1.B2
KO chimera. This allowed us to evaluate the role of the BM beta 1 and
beta 2 adrenergic receptors in mediating BM IS homeostasis and
regulating blood pressure (BP) in an otherwise intact physiological
setting. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting demonstrated that a de-
crease in systolic and mean BP in the AdrB1.B2 KO chimera is
associated with a decrease in circulating inflammatory T cells, mac-
rophage/monocytes, and neutrophils. Transcriptomics in the BM iden-
tified 7,419 differentially expressed transcripts between the C57 and
AdrB1.B2 KO chimera. Pathway analysis revealed differentially ex-
pressed transcripts related to several cell processes in the BM of C57
compared with AdrB1.B2 KO chimera, including processes related to
immunity (e.g., T-cell activation, T-cell recruitment, cytokine produc-
tion, leukocyte migration and function), the cardiovascular system
(e.g., blood vessel development, peripheral nerve blood flow), and the
brain (e.g., central nervous system development, neurite development)
among others. This study generates new insight into the molecular
events that underlie the interaction between the sympathetic drive and
IS in modulation of BP.
adrenergic receptors; immune system; bone marrow; chimera; sym-
pathetic drive
DYNAMIC INTERPLAY BETWEEN the immune system (IS) and the
central nervous system (CNS) exists for physiological homeo-
stasis. The autonomic arm of the CNS, specifically the sym-
pathetic nervous system (SNS), contributes to the diurnal
function of the IS by modulating the development and release
of bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic cells into circulation via
the activation of beta adrenergic receptors expressed by these
cells (17, 18, 25). Activation of the BM beta 1 and 2 adrenergic
receptors, in particular, has been shown to modulate the levels
of different immune cells in circulation, with inflammatory
cells predominantly released during the highest activity period
[i.e., night time in rodents and day time in humans (5, 9, 17, 18,
25)], an evolutionary mechanism developed to prime the sys-
tem for warding off infection, should the need arise. On the
other hand, the reciprocal action of an activated IS on the CNS
has also been suggested, with significant evidence for the role
of an exaggerated IS in diseases of the cardiovascular system
(CVDs) as well as metabolic diseases such as diabetes and
obesity (3, 12, 24, 27).
We have recently suggested a direct role for inflammatory
BM cells in the pathophysiology of hypertension (HTN) in
rodent models that present with this condition (13, 24, 35).
More specifically, we observed a significant increase in BP in
the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat strain following a
full ablation and reconstitution of their IS with BM cells
derived from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) (24).
This was attributed primarily to the proinflammatory nature of
BM cells in the SHRs, which translated into increased systemic
and neuroinflammation, as well as an imbalanced autonomic
drive in the WKY recipients of HTN BM cells (24). Similarly,
the SHRs receiving the WKY BM showed a significant reduc-
tion in blood pressure (BP), owing to the reduction in both the
circulating and central inflammatory profiles (24). Therefore,
there exists a clear role for the exaggerated IS in modulating
both the cardiovascular system and the CNS in HTN, and our
BM experiments confirm other similar studies involving HTN
models (27, 29, 33).
Moreover, we recently observed an increase in the BM SNS
activity in the SHRs, which may contribute to both the aberrant
adrenergic receptor expression in the BM of SHR, as well as
the apparent dysfunction in the diurnal release pattern of the
BM cells into the circulation, leading to chronically elevated
systemic levels of inflammatory cells in the SHRs (35). Con-

 sidering the significant role of an overactive SNS in HTN (7,
26, 35), and in light of the aforementioned evidence, we
hypothesized that BM adrenergic receptor signaling, particu-
larly the beta 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors, play a major role in
the modulation of the BM inflammatory response, which in
turn regulates BP. To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel
mouse BM chimera model, in which the ablated BM was fully
reconstituted with BM derived from the beta 1 and 2 adrenergic
receptor knockout (KO) mice. This allowed us to evaluate the
role of the BM beta 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors in an
otherwise intact physiological setting, without the confounding
effects of the systemic pharmacologic beta adrenergic inhibi-
tion on BP. Thorough BM transcriptome analyses were con-
ducted to identify key molecules and cellular pathways that
may be directly related to beta adrenergic receptor signaling in
the BM. These may prove significant for future studies sepa-
rating the direct BM effects from the overall systemic effects of
an overactive SNS in HTN and related diseases, as well as
proving useful in future development of novel therapeutics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals. All experimental procedures were conducted in accor-
dance with the approved protocols by the University of Florida
Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee and complied with
the standards stated in the National Institutes of Health guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All mice were housed in
a temperature-controlled room (22–23°C) on a 12:12 h light-dark
cycle, in specific pathogen-free cages and had access to standard
mouse
chow
and
water
ad
libitum.
Eight-week-old
male
AdrB1tm1BkkAdrB2tm1Bkk/J, stock number 003810, were purchased
from the Jackson Laboratory. These mice are homozygous null for the
adrenergic receptor beta 1 (Adrb1) and beta 2 (Adrb2) genes, are
viable, fertile, normal in size, and do not display any gross physical or
behavioral abnormalities. Furthermore, these mice have no reported
differences in hematopoiesis. Mice were euthanized, and the whole
BM was extracted by established methods (13, 24, 35). Whole BM
cells from AdrB1tm1BkkAdrB2tm1Bkk/J mice were reconstituted to near
lethally irradiated (x-ray, 950 Rad) 6 wk old male C57BL/6J mice by
a single retro-orbital injection at a ratio of 1:4 (donor-recipient), to
generate the BM AdrB1.B2 KO chimera mice. Control chimera mice
(C57 chimera) were generated by reconstitution of C57BL/6J whole
BM cells into sublethally irradiated age- and sex-matched C57BL/6J
mice by comparable irradiation and reconstitution protocols (24). The
success of BM ablation and reconstitution was confirmed by real-time
PCR in the circulating mononuclear cells (MNCs) using TaqMan
primers for the Adrb1 and Adrb2 receptors (Thermo Fisher Scientific
cat. #4331182). Over 90% reconstitution was considered successful,
in accordance with our previous protocols (24), and as measured by
significantly lower expression of Adrb1 receptors in the blood and
BM of KO chimera mice, which corresponded to the levels seen in the
BM of naive Adrb1tm1BkkAdrb2tm1Bkk/J mice. All reconstituted mice
were allowed to recover for 2–3 mo prior to BP measurements and
tissue and blood collections.
BP. While the mice were under isoflurane anesthesia (2% isoflu-
rane), radiotelemetry transmitters (Data Sciences International) were
placed into the distal left carotid artery and positioned subcutaneously
near the left rear flank region. Following 1 wk of recovery and
acclimation, cardiovascular and activity measurements were recorded
once a week for 24 h and compared over 2 wk of recording. Data were
obtained at 5 min continuous intervals per hour and averaged to
generate the 24 h profiles representing the systolic blood pressure
(SBP) and mean blood pressure (MBP) measurements obtained from
C57 and AdrB1.B2 KO chimera mice. Measurements from day (10:00
AM) and night (8:00 PM) periods were compared between the two
experimental groups, corresponding to the lowest and highest rodent
activity and sympathetic drive periods (35), respectively.
BM histology. Mice were euthanized, and the femoral whole BM
was collected intact from AdrB1.B2 KO (n � 4) and control C57
chimera mice (n � 4). BM cores were decalcified in 10% formic acid
for 30–60 min, transferred to 10% neutral buffered formalin, and
processed routinely overnight into paraffin-embedded blocks. There-
after, 3 �m thick sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin. These biopsy sections were histologically evaluated by veter-
inary pathologists with regard to tissue architecture and cellularity,
amount of fibrosis, relative cell type percentages of total population,
and individual cell morphology (up to a magnification of �400).
Circulating inflammatory cells. Blood was collected from all mice
at night time (8:00 PM), corresponding to the period of highest
sympathetic drive (35), to compare its effects on the BM-derived
circulating inflammatory and endothelial progenitor cells in C57 and
AdrB1.B2 KO chimera mice. For fluorescence-activated cell sort-
ing (FACS), MNCs from blood were prepared in a concentration of
0.5–1 � 106 cells/100 �l of PBS � 2% FBS � 1 mM EDTA
medium, as previously described (13, 24, 35). Circulating CD4� cells
were used as representative markers of T cells (antibody purchased
from Biolegend, cat. #100406), CD11b� cells were used as represen-
tative markers of monocytes/macrophages (antibody purchased from
eBiosciences, cat. #53-0112-82), CD184�.CD62L� cells were used
as representative markers of neutrophils (anti-CD184 purchased from
BD Biosciences, cat. #551966; anti-CD62L purchased from BD
Biosciences, cat. #553152), and Tie2� cells were used as representa-
tive markers of angiogenic/endothelial progenitor cells (eBiosciences,
cat. #53-0112-82). Additional antibodies were used to confirm the
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) competence in C57 and AdrB1.B2 KO
chimera, immediately following the irradiation-reconstitution proto-
col: Sca (BD Biosciences, cat. #553108), c-kit (BD Biosciences, cat.
#560557), and Lin (eBioscience, cat. #88-7772). The antibodies were
used as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were incubated with
antibodies for 30 min at 4°C. Individual antibodies for each filter were
prepared in separate cell suspensions and used as positive controls.
After being centrifuged (1,200 rpm � 15 min) and washed with
PBS � 2% FBS � 1 mM EDTA medium, cells were fixed with 1%
paraformaldehyde for flow analyses. All samples were read using an
LSR-II (BD Biosystems) at the University of Florida ICBR, and the
data were analyzed with FACS Diva software, version 6.1.2. All data
are presented as % MNCs.
Tissue collection and isolation of total RNA. Mice were euthanized,
and the femoral whole BM was collected from AdrB1.B2 KO and
control C57 chimera mice by established methods (13, 24, 35). For
isolation of MNCs from the BM, femoral bones were collected into
MNC isolation buffer (PBS � 2% FBS � 1 mM EDTA buffer). Both
tips of the epiphyses were cut to flush the BM cells using the MNC
isolation buffer into a sterile conical tube. For isolation of MNCs from
blood, 200 �l of blood was collected from the tail vein of anesthetized
mice following their recovery from the irradiation-reconstitution pro-
tocol. Cells were centrifuged (1,200 rpm � 15 min) at room temper-
ature (RT) and were washed 2 � in 30 ml of sterile PBS, followed by
treatment with 4–5 ml of ammonium chloride (STEM CELL Tech-
nology, cat. #07850) to lyse the red blood cells. The resulting MNCs
were rinsed in MNC isolation buffer, centrifuged, and saved in RT
lysis buffer at �80°C for total RNA isolation.
RNA extraction. Extraction of RNA from BM and blood was
performed using 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA) per manufacturer’s protocol. Turbo DNase (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific, Waltham, MA) was used per manufacturer’s protocol to
eliminate remaining DNA contaminants. Final nucleic acid pellets
were resuspended in 30 �l RNase/DNase-free water. Total RNA
integrity for all samples used in microarray and real-time PCR
analyses was determined using the RNA 6000 Nano Assay Kit with
the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The
mean RNA integrity value for all samples was 9.21 (SE � 0.13).

 Microarray analyses and bioinformatics. The SurePrint G3 Mouse
GE 8 � 60K Microarray Kit (Agilent product number, G4852A
design ID 028005) was used for expression analyses (Agilent). Sam-
ple sizes for microarray analyses were n � 8 for both groups. In brief,
the RNeasy Mini Kit was used to purify RNA prior to labeling, as per
the manufacture’s protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA concentra-
tions were determined using the NanoDrop-2000 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific). Microarray hybridizations were performed ac-
cording to the One-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Anal-
ysis Low Input Quick Amp Labeling kit (Agilent V6.5, May 2010)
and 50 ng total RNA/sample was used for labeling and hybridization,
as per our previous methods (6, 22). Microarrays were scanned at 5
�m with the Agilent G2505C Microarray Scanner and Agilent Feature
Extraction Software (v. 10.1.1.1) was used to extract raw signal
intensities from microarray images. Microarray data were evaluated
by manual inspection of the quality control parameters. All arrays
were deemed high quality. Raw microarray data have been deposited
into the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expres-
sion Omnibus database (Series GSE71631, GPL13912 Agilent-
028005 SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8 � 60K Microarray).
Raw intensity data were imported into JMP Genomics v7.0 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Intensity data were normalized with quantile
normalization. Control probes were filtered out prior to identifying
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the limit of detection was
set to an intensity of 3.5 based on the Agilent spike in controls and
dark corners. Therefore, any probe falling below this value was
assigned a normalized intensity of 3.5. DEGs were identified by a
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a false discovery
rate (FDR) set at 5.0%. All quality control probes were removed prior
to determining DEGs. Cluster analyses were conducted in JMP
Genomics v7.0 using all probes in the clustering. Two-way clustering
using the Fast ward algorithm was conducted after each row was
centered to a mean of zero (0) and variance scaled to one.
Pathway Studio 9.0 (Elsevier) and ResNet 10.0 were used for
subnetwork enrichment analyses (SNEA) of cell processes (21). The
option of “best P value” in Pathway Studio was used for duplicated
probes. A total number of 32,734 mouse probes were successfully
mapped to the program using the official gene name. SNEA was
performed to identify gene networks that were significantly different
in the BM tissue. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with 500 permutations
was conducted to determine whether specific networks were enriched
in expression compared with the background reference probability
distribution. Networks are constructed based on common regulators of
expression and regulators of specific cell processes. The enrichment P
value for a gene seed was set at P � 0.05. Additional details on the
use of SNEA can be found in Langlois and Martyniuk (2013) (15).
Real-time PCR. For microarray validation, primer sets from target
genes were collected from literature (Supplemental Table S1).1 Prim-
ers for targeted genes were designed from the Harvard primer bank.
Transcripts that were selected for microarray validation are related to
the IS and showed a high and significant fold change between groups.
These included chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (melanoma growth
stimulating activity, alpha) (Cxcl1); integrin, alpha 4 (antigen CD49D,
alpha 4 subunit Of VLA-4 receptor) (Itga4); and Ms4a4b. For con-
firmation of beta adrenergic receptor KO in the AdrB1.B2 KO
chimera, primer sets for beta 1 adrenergic receptor (Adrb1) were used
(5= to 3=: GAA GGC GCT CAA GAC ACT GG; 3= to 5=: CCA GGT
CGC GGT GGA A).
The iScript Reverse Transcription kit for Real-time PCR (Bio-Rad)
was used per manufacturer’s protocol to reverse transcribe 1 �g total
RNA. Real-time PCR analyses using the CFX96 Real-Time PCR
Detection System (Bio-Rad) were carried out using the SSoAdvanced
Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), 100 nM
of each forward and reverse primer, and 5 �l of DNase-treated cDNA
that was first diluted 20-fold prior to real-time analyses (final volume
of 10 �l). The two-step thermal cycling parameters were as follows:
initial 1 cycle Taq activation at 95°C for 30 s, followed by 95°C for
5 s, and primer annealing at 58°C (or 60°C) for 5 s. After 40 cycles,
a dissociation curve was generated, starting at 65.0°C and ending at
95.0°C with increments of 0.5°C every 5 s.
Three reference genes (Eef1a1, Rpl18, and Gapdh) were assessed
for stability and appropriateness for normalization. Expression values
of reference genes were evaluated statistically by a Kruskal-Wallis
test to determine if expression levels significantly varied across
experimental groups. This was based upon the Cq value. The mean
expression levels of both Eef1a1 and Rpl18 were determined to be the
most stable combination of reference genes and were used to normal-
ize all gene targets. The target stability function in the CFX96
software determined that the combined M value was 0.78 (CV �
0.27). Each primer set was tested for linearity and efficiency using a
four- or five-point standard curve generated by a dilution series from
a cDNA pool of BM. Real-time PCR analyses included 1) three
samples that did not receive reverse transcriptase (no RT control) and
2) one sample that did not receive any cDNA template. Negative
controls indicated that DNase treatment sufficiently removed genomic
DNA to a level that did not influence gene expression analyses.
Normalized gene expression was extracted with CFX Manager soft-
ware using the relative ��Cq method (baseline subtracted) based on
the method of Pfaffl (2001) (23). Sample sizes were n � 8 for each
group. All primers used in the real-time PCR analysis amplified one
product, indicated by a single melting curve. All samples used in the
microarray analyses were represented in the real-time PCR experi-
ments. Gene expression data were analyzed by a nonparametric
Mann-Whitney test. All analyses were performed in Prism (v. 6.0).
RESULTS
BP and circulating inflammatory cells. We observed a trend
in a decreased SBP in the AdrB1.B2 KO chimera compared
with C57 chimera mice during the day (from 110 � 6 to 101 �
2 mmHg; P � 0.2, Fig. 1A). However, we saw a significant
decrease in SBP in the AdrB1.B2 KO compared with C57
chimeras at night (from 131 � 2 to 123 � 2 mmHg; P � 0.05,
Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease in
MBP in the AdrB1.B2 KO compared with C57 chimeras at
night (from 115 � 5 to 103 � 1 mmHg; P � 0.05, Fig. 1B).
This was accompanied by a significant decrease in overall
circulating CD4� T cells (from 11 � 2 to 2.4 � 0.8), Iba1�
macrophage/monocytes (from 17.4 � 4 to 8.4 � 0.9), and
CD184�.CD62L� neutrophils (from 22 � 5 to 7 � 0.8) in the
AdrB1.B2 KOs compared with the C57 chimeras (P � 0.05,
Fig. 1D), presented as % MNCs in circulation. We observed no
significant difference in circulating Tie2� endothelial progen-
itors in the AdrB1.B2 KO compared with the C57 chimera
mice (19 � 4 vs 32 � 6; P � 0.09, Fig. 1D). Figure 1C shows
representative examples of raw flow cytometry readings for
circulating T cells (Fig. 1C, top), macrophage/monocytes (Fig.
1C, middle) and neutrophils (Fig. 1C, bottom) in the C57 and
AdrB1B2 chimera mice. Finally, no significant difference was
observed in the circulating levels of HSCs between C57 and
AdrB1.B2 KO chimera mice (Fig. 2).
BM histology. Sections of BM from C57 (n � 4) and
AdrB1.B2 KO chimera mice (n � 4) were well vascularized
and highly cellular. Ample numbers of myeloid precursors,
erythroid precursors, and megakaryocytes were present in
both groups (Fig. 3). Low to intermediate amounts of
amorphous to globular, golden brown pigment (consistent
with iron) were present in both groups, predominantly

 extracellularly but also occasionally associated with macro-
phages. Though there was regional variation in both groups,
the overall M:E ratios were 1.0:1.0 and 1.3:1.0 in the C57
and AdrB1.B2 KO chimera groups, respectively. No signif-
icant histologic lesions were detected in any sections, and
there were no histological differences noted between the
control and KO chimera.
Transcriptomics analyses in the BM of chimera mice. The
number of differentially expressed probes in the BM between
the two chimeras was 13,797 (P value � 0.05), and an adjusted
P value (FDR � 5%) yielded 7,419 differentially expressed
probes. Those transcripts that showed a high level of fold
induction (�100-fold increase) in the BM included NDC80
kinetochore complex component (Nuf2), intelectin 1 (Itln1),
interferon-activated gene 202B (Ifi202b), ST6 (alpha-N-acetyl-
neuraminyl-2,3-beta-galactosyl-1,3)-N-acetylgalactosaminide
alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 2 (St6galnac2), BALB/c immuno-
globulin heavy chain (AF466698), and histocompatibility 60a
(H60a). Differentially expressed transcripts that showed a high
level of fold reduction in the BM (50- to 100-fold decrease)
included villin-like (Vill), purine nucleoside phosphorylase
(Pnp2), small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (Snhg12), killer cell
lectin-like receptor subfamily A pseudogene 1 (Klra2), and
cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 3-like (Cpsf3l).
All expression data are provided in Appendix 1 (see Supple-
mental Material). Overall, the expression patterns separated
into two distinct groups, as demonstrated by the cluster anal-
yses (Fig. 4).

mean blood pressure (MBP, in B) in AdrB1.B2 KO chimera at night (dark red bar, P � 0.05). This was accompanied by a significant reduction in the CD4�
T cells, CD11b� macrophage/monocytes, and CD184�.CD62L� neutrophil levels in the circulation of the AdrB1.B2 KO chimera mice as measured at night (dark
bars, P � 0.05) (C, D). C: examples of raw flow cytometry data for circulating T cells (top), macrophage/monocytes (middle), and neutrophils (bottom) in the

 Enrichment analysis reveals differences in the BM between
the two mouse groups. Gene-set enrichment analyses revealed
that the pathways of “tight junction assembly (Occludin),”
“histidine metabolism,” “Notch ¡ RBPJ/HES/HEY signal-
ing,” and “endothelin receptor a ¡ AP-1/CREB signaling”
were increased in expression by �10%, while the expression
of “biosynthesis of CoA and holo-ACP” was decreased �13%
in the BM AdrB1.B2 KO chimera compared with C57 chimera
mice (Appendix 2). Cell processes that were differentially
expressed (P � 0.01) in the BM between the control C57
chimera and the AdrB1.B2 KO chimera mice, as determined by
SNEA, included those related to immunity (e.g., T-cell activa-
tion, T-cell recruitment, cytokine production, macrophage ad-
hesion and interaction, leukocyte migration and function, nat-
ural killer cell differentiation), the cardiovascular system (e.g.,
blood vessel development, peripheral nerve blood flow), and
the brain (CNS development, neurite development). Other
DEG networks include osteoclast differentiation, tissue regen-
eration, lipid storage, and adipocyte differentiation. All sub-
networks are presented in Appendix 2.
Perhaps not surprisingly, the most prominent system af-
fected in the BM at the level of the transcriptome was the IS.
We observed both an increase and a decrease in specific
immune-related pathways in the AdrB1.B2 KO chimera mice
at the transcriptome level. For example, we observed a de-
crease in T-cell interaction by �14% in the BM of AdrB1.B2
KO chimera (Fig. 5). As part of this network, the transcripts
with suppressed expression included several CD molecules
(e.g., CD2, CD4, CD8A, CD28, CD52), interleukins (e.g.,
IL-2, IL-10, IL-21), and members of the tumor necrosis factor
receptor superfamily (e.g., TNFRSF9, 11, 14, 18). Further-
more, gene networks related to lymphocyte function (prolifer-
ation, adhesion, chemotaxis, and activation; Fig. 6) and mono-
cyte function (e.g., differentiation, recruitment, and adhesion;
Supplemental Fig. S1) were differentially expressed between
the two experimental groups. In the lymphocyte network,
differentially expressed transcripts included chemokine (C-
X-C Motif) ligand 1 (melanoma growth stimulating activity,
alpha) (Cxcl1, 18-fold) stabilin 2 (Stab2, 30-fold), and
interleukin 18 (Il18), which were all increased. Significantly
downregulated transcripts in the network include CD47
molecule (Cd47), chemokine (C-X-C Motif) receptor 3
(Cxcr3), and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (Lag3). In the
monocyte networks, differentially expressed transcripts that
were significantly upregulated include CD14 molecule
(CD14), interferon beta 1 fibroblast (Ifnb1), and chemokine
(C-C Motif) ligand 2CD14 (Ccl2), while those downregu-

In terms of other pathways not related to the IS, we observed
significant upregulation in renin, renin2, and angiotensinogen
transcripts in the BM of AdrB1.B2 KO chimera (Appendix 1).
In addition, we observed several significantly different expres-
sions of transcripts related to olfaction in the BM of AdrB1.B2
KO chimera (Supplemental Table S2).

 Diseases related to transcriptional responses in the BM
include those related to the immune, cardiovascular, and
central nervous systems. We also performed SNEA for dis-
eases related to the BM profiles (Supplemental Fig. S3). The
SNEA algorithm identifies the set of entities (subnetworks)
organized by specific relationships, which are implicated as the
most significant based on experimental data. SNEA builds
networks from a central “seed” from all relevant entities in the
ResNet 10.0 database, and retrieving associated entities based
on their relationship with the seed (binding partners, expres-
sion targets, protein modification targets, and others). The
algorithm first calculates a background distribution of all ex-
pression values (fold change). The subnetwork distribution of
the expression values is then calculated in a similar manner for
all subnetworks constructed in the previous step. The algorithm
compares the subnetwork distribution to the background dis-
tribution using one-sided Mann-Whitney U-test and calculates
a P value indicating the statistical significance of difference
between two distributions. Cell processes that are enriched are
those that have an expression distribution significantly differ-
ent than that expected by chance.
Cell processes were then manually grouped into major
physiological process (e.g., reproduction, immune, organ de-
velopment, etc.) to achieve a more global view of the cell
processes affected in the BM at the transcriptome level. Major
themes that were different between the C57 control and
AdrB1.B2 KO chimera mice include those related to CVD
(e.g., vein tone, myocardial ischemia, coronary vasospasm,
coagulopathy, and acute coronary syndrome), immune disor-
ders (e.g., leukocytosis, leukopenia, lymphocyte infiltration,
autoimmune response, vasculitis, and gout), cancer (fibrosar-
coma, bone neoplasms, mastocytoma), bacterial infection
(Lyme disease, malaria), and diseases related to the neural
system (e.g., attention deficit disorder, Tourette syndrome,
astrocyte hypertrophy, depression, mania, and delirium) (Sup-
plemental Fig. S2). Supplemental Table S3 shows other exam-
ples of molecular networks related to diseases that are differ-
entially expressed between control chimera mice (c57 chimera)
and AdrB1.B2 KO chimera mice in the bone, with a focus on
both the cardiovascular system and immune system.
Real-time PCR validation of transcriptomics results. Rela-
tive expression of Cxcl1 was significantly higher (�30-fold) in
the BM of AdrB1.B2 KO compared with C57 chimera mice
(Fig. 7A, P � 0.0003). This was consistent with the microarray
data showing a 18.5-fold increase in this transcript. Itga4
showed no difference in the relative expression in the two
mouse groups, as determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 7B, P �
0.64), and this corresponded to one of the probes for this gene
on the array that also showed no change in expression. Lastly,
real-time PCR for Ms4a4b showed a significant decrease in its
relative expression levels (�12-fold) in the BM of AdrB1.B2
KO compared with C57 chimera (Fig. 7C, P � 0.0002). This
was consistent with the two probes on the microarray, showing
a significant decrease (�10-fold) in Ms4a4b steady-state
mRNA levels. In addition, we observed a dramatic suppression
of Adrb1 in the circulating MNCs of AdrB1.B2 KO chimera
immediately following the recovery from the irradiation/recon-
stitution protocol (Fig. 7D), confirming their KO phenotype.

The present study builds upon our previous research describ-

 (13, 24, 35). We have also previously shown an increase in
sympathetic drive to the femoral BM in the SHR, a rodent
model of HTN also characterized by exaggerated central and
peripheral IS activation (35). Considering the prominent role of
sympathetic drive in regulation of daily BM homeostatic ac-
tivity (5, 9, 17, 18, 25, 35), we hypothesized that direct
sympathetic drive effects on BM cells may contribute to BP
control, and that, in turn, blockade of the BM adrenergic
receptors would lower the expression of inflammatory media-
tors and thus reduce BP.
This study is novel in a number of ways. First, we generated
a mouse chimera in which the BM was irradiated and fully
reconstituted with BM from beta 1 and 2 adrenergic receptor
KO mice. This allowed us to study the effects of specific
blockade of the sympathetic drive on the BM cells and how this
relates to the circulating IS and BP control, without the use of
the beta adrenergic pharmacological inhibitors, which are ex-
pected to have confounding effects on the cardiovascular
system as a whole. We chose to target the beta 1 and 2
adrenergic receptors, due to their well-established roles in
maintenance of BM cell homeostasis (5, 9, 17, 18, 25), and our
previous studies showing aberrant expression levels of beta
adrenergic receptors in the BM of SHRs (35), a hallmark
hypertensive rat model.
Here, for the first time, we present evidence of the direct role
of BM adrenergic receptors, and thus the BM SNS, in regula-
tion of both BM and circulating inflammatory mediators, and
consequently BP in our mouse model. Specifically, we show
that genetic ablation of beta 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors in the
BM leads to dramatic changes in the BM immune mediators,
which translates into reduced circulatory levels of a subtype of
T cells, neutrophils and macrophages, and a significant reduc-
tion of BP at night, when the sympathetic drive and release of
inflammatory cells from the BM are at their highest point in
rodents (35). These effects appear to be purely beta adrenergic
receptor-dependent, as we observed no histologic abnormali-
ties in the BM of either control or AdrB1.B2 KO chimera mice.
These findings support our previous studies, suggesting an
association between an inflammatory BM and a pathological
increase in BP in rodents (13, 24, 35), and highlights a
functional relationship between BP control and the sympathetic
drive to the BM (35). Others have shown a strong association
between the sympathetic drive and development and mainte-
nance of HTN (7, 26), and an association between both
peripheral and central inflammation and HTN (3, 13, 24,
29–35). However, this study is the first to confirm the direct
involvement of BM sympathetic drive in regulation of BP via
BM-derived inflammatory factors in an otherwise intact and
unchallenged system. The question, however, remains as to
how both the BP and the IS in our mouse model would respond
to a pro-HTN challenge such as angiotensin II, or increased
dietary salt/fat, all of which are expected to increase sympa-
thetic drive and exacerbate inflammation, and future studies are
expected to address these questions.
In addition to investigating the physiological and IS effects
of BM adrenergic receptor blockade, here we aimed to gener-

 ate mechanistic data on transcriptional molecular and cellular
networks that are differentially expressed in the BM of
AdrB1.B2 KO compared with control C57 chimera mice,
which may provide a significant insight into molecular mech-
anisms of BM SNS-IS interaction, and offer potential novel
therapeutic mechanisms for control of BP. We observed
�7,000 differentially expressed probes in the BM between the
two chimera groups; thus, the transcriptomes between the two
animal models remained markedly different at 3 mo following
the BM reconstitution. Thorough pathway analyses methods
revealed that cell processes and activities related to immunity
(e.g., T-cell activation, T-cell recruitment, cytokine production,
leukocyte migration and function) and the cardiovascular sys-
tem (e.g., blood vessel development, peripheral nerve blood
flow) were differentially expressed between the two groups. In
terms of the transcriptome changes associated with diseases
described in the literature, the significantly altered transcrip-
tional networks between the two mouse models showed
marked associations to immune diseases (e.g., leukocytosis,
lymphocyte infiltration, autoimmune responses), CVD (e.g.,
vein tone, myocardial ischemia, coagulopathy, and acute cor-
onary syndrome), and diseases related to the CNS (e.g., atten-
tion deficit disorder, Tourette syndrome, astrocyte hypertro-
phy, depression, mania, and delirium), among others. Thus, the
transcriptional network changes support a role for the BM
adrenergic receptor system in regulation of BM cell homeo-
stasis that may have significant implications for not only the IS
or cardiovascular homeostasis, but also for various other sys-
tems and diseases, some of which may not yet have been
associated with the SNS. In this way, our current network
analysis may lead to recognition of novel molecular and
cellular targets for research and development of therapies for
an array of conditions.
Of particular importance for the control of BP is the ob-
served decrease in specific T cell-related transcriptomes in the
BM of AdrB1.B2 KO chimera, which included CD4 and
CD8A molecules, as well as several inflammatory interleukins
and members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfam-
ily. This pinpoints specific molecular mechanisms involved in
the SNS/beta adrenergic receptor-dependent control of BM
inflammatory factors, which may be of significance in future
studies and novel therapeutics. Interestingly, the reduction in
expression of CD4 molecule in the BM of AdrB1.B2 KO
chimera corresponds to the observed reduction in the CD4� T
cells in circulation, suggesting a direct role of BM beta adren-
ergic receptors in regulation of these cells. Several studies have
pinpointed the importance of T cells in human HTN as well as
in rodent models of HTN characterized by high sympathetic
drive, such as the ANG II-infusion model and the SHR (2, 13,
24, 29, 33, 35). Here, for the first time, we show a direct
correlation between the BM beta adrenergic receptor system
and BM CD4 molecular transcript levels and circulating CD4�
T cell levels, suggesting that increase in the BM SNS activity,
as previously observed in the SHR (35), may directly contrib-

 ute to HTN via modulation of BM inflammatory cells and
factors which are upregulated in this animal model (24, 35).
From this, it follows that other types of BM-derived inflam-
matory cells, such as the CD8� T cells, which are upregulated
in rodent HTN models (13, 24, 29, 35), may also be directly
modulated via the BM adrenergic receptor system. We further
observed a decrease in the molecular transcript levels of CD2
and CD28 molecules in the BM of AdrB1.B2 KO chimera,
both important in T cell activation (8), as well as a decrease in
CD52 transcript, a surface marker expressed by specific CD4�
T cells with a previously reported role in pathophysiology of
diabetes and autoimmune disease (1). Other downregulated
IS-related molecules included CXCR3 and Lag3, involved in
recruitment and activation of lymphocytes respectively (10,
11). Furthermore, a reduction in IL-21 transcript, a proinflam-
matory and protumorigenic marker associated with develop-
ment of colitis and colorectal cancer (4), and reduction in
CD47 molecule, a modulator of macrophage-directed phago-
cytosis of immunogenic tumor cells (16) in the BM of
AdrB1.B2 KO chimera, are examples of uncovering potentially
novel mechanisms which may be relevant in specific anti-
cancer immune therapeutics. Thus, our current methods may
have uncovered novel concepts in regulation of T cell activa-
tion in the BM, based on the functional and direct BM SNS-IS
communication, whose relevance may spread beyond that of
the BP regulation or CVD. It is not clear, however, whether
these and other transcriptome changes in the BM are exclu-
sively a response to the downregulation of beta adrenergic
receptor signaling in the BM. Considering that we did not
perform transcriptomics in the naïve AdrB1.B2 KO mice, it is
possible that some BM transcriptome changes seen in the
AdrB1.B2 KO chimera arose following the reconstitution pe-
riod, as IS changes modified the system as a whole, which
could potentially induce reciprocal systemic effects on the BM
cells.
Using pathway analysis, we further organized the transcripts
into specific gene networks, to reveal additional information on
the significance of changes in specific cell type processes,
activity, function and interaction between different molecules
within a specific gene network and between the experimental
groups. For example, we report that lymphocyte function (e.g.,
proliferation, adhesion, chemotaxis, and activation) and mono-
cyte function (e.g., differentiation, recruitment, and adhesion)
are differentially expressed in the two mouse chimeras. The
majority of gene networks associated with T cells, monocytes,
and macrophages were increased in the BM of AdrB1.B2 KO
mice relative to the control C57 chimera group. Again, con-
sidering that the collective gene networks are composed of
numerous transcripts, it is not clear whether the transcriptome
and/or network changes observed following our experimental

 manipulation are indeed a direct result of the loss of sympa-
thetic drive to the BM, or due to secondary effects of the
transplantation. We propose that some systemic compensatory
responses may have occurred (i.e., upregulation of transcrip-
tional networks related to the BM IS) during the recovery
period following the reconstitution of C57 mice with the KO
BM, as is often the case with transgenic manipulations, and as
suggested above. In addition, studies have shown that BM-
derived immune cells can show transitions in transcriptional
networks when moving from bone to blood, as is the case with
neutrophils (14). It would be interesting to determine how the
BM SNS regulates these transitions in specific immune cells. It
remains to be seen, however, how the individual transcripts and
gene networks behave following a pro-HTN challenge with a
resulting increase in the BM SNS activity in our mouse model.
Furthermore, studies are needed to discern the precise mecha-
nisms of the posttranscriptional regulation by the adrenergic
receptors in the BM, with microRNA- and noncoding RNA-
dependent regulation of IS gene expression presenting as the
obvious candidates for further investigation (19, 28). Never-
theless, our data conclusively point to clear molecular, immune
and cardiovascular effects following reconstitution with the
BM lacking the beta 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors.
In summary, by highlighting specific cellular and molecular
networks associated with SNS-IS communication in the BM
and their role in BP control, this study provides a fundamental
framework from which to test the role of other factors in
conditions such as HTN and beyond. It is imperative to also
address specific tissue inflammatory responses, which may be
related to the BM SNS-IS communication in HTN for example.
Of particular importance may be the feedback effect of the BM
inflammatory activity on the brain cardioregulatory regions.
Neuroinflammation has been recognized as a hallmark of
neurogenic HTN (3, 13, 24, 30–32), in which the increase in
the sympathetic drive precedes development of HTN (26, 35),
while the infiltration of BM-derived immune cells to brain
cardioregulatory regions, such as the paraventricular nucleus
(PVN) of the hypothalamus, marks the later stages of estab-
lished HTN (13, 24). This may, in turn, further contribute to
increased sympathetic drive to the periphery including the BM.
In such a way, an aberrant BM SNS-IS interaction may exist in
the form of a pathologic feed-forward mechanism in HTN.
Thus, identification of the major molecular pathways involved
in this process can be used to strengthen the link between BM
cell infiltration and PVN neuroinflammation. This may prove
crucial in generating novel therapeutic targets capable of in-
terrupting the proposed vicious cycle of HTN pathophysiology.
This is important, as up to 20% of HTN cases are resistant to
current pharmaceuticals, possibly due to a neurogenic origin of
HTN and an inefficacy of most drugs in crossing the blood-
brain barrier.
