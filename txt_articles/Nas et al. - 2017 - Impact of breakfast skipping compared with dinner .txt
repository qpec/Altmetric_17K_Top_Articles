ABSTRACT
Background: Meal skipping has become an increasing trend of the
modern lifestyle that may lead to obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Objective: We investigated whether the timing of meal skipping
impacts these risks by affecting circadian regulation of energy bal-
ance, glucose metabolism, and postprandial inflammatory responses.
Design: In a randomized controlled crossover trial, 17 participants
[body mass index (in kg/m2): 23.7 6 4.6] underwent 3 isocaloric
24-h interventions (55%, 30%, and 15% carbohydrate, fat, and pro-
tein, respectively): a breakfast skipping day (BSD) and a dinner
skipping day (DSD) separated by a conventional 3-meal-structure
day (control). Energy and macronutrient balance was measured in a
respiration chamber. Postprandial glucose, insulin, and inflamma-
tory responses in leukocytes as well as 24-h glycemia and insulin
secretion were analyzed.
Results: When compared with the 3-meal control, 24-h energy
expenditure was higher on both skipping days (BSD: +41 kcal/d;
DSD: +91 kcal/d; both P , 0.01), whereas fat oxidation increased
on the BSD only (+16 g/d; P , 0.001). Spontaneous physical ac-
tivity, 24-h glycemia, and 24-h insulin secretion did not differ be-
tween intervention days. The postprandial homeostasis model
assessment index (+54%) and glucose concentrations after lunch
(+46%) were, however, higher on the BSD than on the DSD (both
P , 0.05). Concomitantly, a longer fasting period with breakfast
skipping also increased the inflammatory potential of peripheral
blood cells after lunch.
Conclusions: Compared with 3 meals/d, meal skipping increased
energy expenditure. In contrast, higher postprandial insulin con-
centrations and increased fat oxidation with breakfast skipping
suggest the development of metabolic inflexibility in response to
prolonged fasting that may in the long term lead to low-grade
inflammation and impaired glucose homeostasis. This trial was
registered
at
clinicaltrials.gov
as
NCT02635139.

INTRODUCTION
Eating in misalignment with the biological clock (e.g., skipping
breakfast and consuming bigger meals in the evening or eating late
at night) is associated with an increased risk of obesity and type
2 diabetes (1, 2). On the other hand, popular trends such as
breakfast or dinner skipping are advertised for weight management;
however, conclusive scientific evidence to support these supposi-
tions is lacking (3).
Previous tightly controlled room calorimetry studies that in-
vestigated the impact of meal frequency on the regulation of energy
balance under isocaloric conditions did not find a difference in
energy expenditure between large (1–2 meals/d), normal (3 meals/d),
or small, frequent (.5 meals/d) patterns (4–8). Although no effect
of consumption frequency on mean 24-h energy expenditure and
respiratory quotient (RQ)7 was observed in these studies, a lower
frequency of 2 or 3 compared with 6–14 meals increased sleeping or
resting metabolic rate (5, 6) and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT)
(4) and changed the diurnal pattern of nutrient partitioning to in-
creased fat oxidation until noon (4, 8). The timing of meal con-
sumption has also been shown to affect DIT, with higher levels in
the morning than in the afternoon and night (9). A 44% lower DIT
in the evening than in the morning (10) argues against a beneficial
effect of breakfast skipping on energy balance and suggests a fa-
vorable impact of dinner skipping. We therefore hypothesized that
breakfast skipping compared with dinner skipping leads to lower
total energy expenditure.

 Diurnal differences in energy expenditure and nutrient parti-
tioning can be mediated by sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
activity and endocrine factors. With lower meal frequency, higher
peaks and subsequently lower troughs of insulin might lead to
increased fat oxidation (6). In addition to meal frequency, cir-
cadian rhythms in insulin sensitivity are known to affect blood
glucose concentrations and insulin secretion in response to meal
timing. Thus, the same meal consumed in the evening not only
leads to a lower metabolic rate but also increases glycemic and
insulinemic responses, which suggests circadian variations in
energy expenditure as well as the metabolic pattern in healthy
individuals (11). A nocturnal lifestyle with breakfast skipping
and a delayed eating pattern thus can lead to increased 24-h
glycemia (8) and impairment of insulin response to glucose (1)
and could therefore contribute to an increased risk of type 2
diabetes. We therefore hypothesized that breakfast skipping
compared with dinner skipping leads to impaired glucose me-
tabolism. As a possible underlying mechanism, increased low-
grade inflammation induced by a sudden shift to postprandial
conditions after prolonged fasting was investigated.
The primary aim of the present study was to compare the
effects of breakfast skipping with dinner skipping on 24-h energy
expenditure and substrate partitioning as well as (secondary
aims) on 24-h SNS activity, the inflammatory response of blood
cells, and insulin, glucose, and appetite profiles by using a 3-meal
control day as a reference and applying well-controlled energy
balance conditions in a metabolic chamber.
METHODS
Study population
Seventeen healthy adults (9 women, 8 men) were recruited
by notice board postings at the universities of Hohenheim and
Stuttgart between October 2015 and April 2016. Exclusion criteria
were food allergies or intolerances, alternative nutrition habits,
smoking, chronic diseases, or regular use of medications. The
CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) flow-
chart shows the passage of participants through the different stages
of the present trial, including enrollment, allocation to the
interventions, and analysis (Supplemental Figure 1). Thirteen
participants were regular breakfast eaters and 4 were occasional
breakfast skippers. The terms “breakfast eaters” and “skippers”
were not further defined to participants or by investigators. The
study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the
Medical Council of Baden-Wu
¨rttemberg, Germany. The trial was
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02635139. All of the par-
ticipants provided written informed consent before participation.
Study protocol
A randomized crossover nutrition intervention was conducted
at the Institute of Nutritional Medicine at the University of
Hohenheim. An outline of the study protocol is given in Figure 1.
A 3-d run-in period with a controlled diet preceded the in-
tervention phase to adapt macronutrient oxidation to macronu-
trient intake (12). On the intervention days, participants consumed
isocaloric diets (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 15% protein) with
three 24-h conditions: 1) a conventional 3-meal-structure day
(control), 2) a breakfast skipping day (BSD), and 3) a dinner
skipping day (DSD). The BSD and DSD were randomly assigned,
and the first skipping day was followed by a washout day to again
obtain a constant fasting period of 18 h before the next in-
tervention day. Thus, the sequence of the intervention days was
either BSD-washout-control-DSD or DSD-washout-control-BSD.
Participants were randomly assigned by using block randomiza-
tion to begin with the BSD or DSD intervention in a 1:1 allocation
ratio that was based on a computer-generated list of random
numbers by an independent scientist. The study team enrolled and
assigned the participants to the interventions. During the entire
caloric chamber period, participants followed a constant daily
routine: wake up at 0600; meals at 0700, 1300, and 1900; and
bedtime at 2200. On the day before the first intervention day,
participants were admitted to the institute at 1830 to install a
continuous glucose-monitoring sensor. Participants spent the
night before each intervention day in the caloric chamber and left
the morning after the intervention day. On the washout day,
participants were allowed to go home for 12 h.
During the intervention days, blood samples were collected
frequently from 0700 to 2100 to measure free fatty acid (FFA),
ghrelin, and cortisol concentrations (ghrelin and cortisol were
determined in a subsample of 8 participants and ghrelin was
measured on the skipping days only). The first blood sample at
0700 was taken in a fasting state. After lunch on the skipping
days, blood was sampled every 30 min for 2 h for the de-
termination of glucose and insulin concentrations as well as for
the assessment of immune cell activity.
Control of energy intake and physical activity
During the whole study period participants all foods were
provided from the Institute of Nutritional Medicine’s metabolic

 kitchen. Participants were instructed to only consume the pro-
vided food, water, and unsweetened tea and to refrain from
vigorous physical activity. During the first 2 d of the 3-d run-in
period, participants ate ad libitum and leftovers were back-
weighed to calculate dietary intake. On the other study days,
all of the provided food was consumed and participants were
required to remain sedentary. Macronutrient composition was
kept constant throughout the entire study period and for each
meal. On intervention days, participants received the same food
items on each day. Individual diet composition was calculated
by using Prodi6 software (Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesell-
schaft). Energy intake was based on individual energy re-
quirements to obtain energy balance. Skipped meals were
therefore compensated for by an equally increased energy con-
tent of the other 2 meals on this day (equal energy content of
both remaining meals). On the control day, each of the 3 meals
had the same energy content. Individual energy requirement was
calculated on the basis of resting metabolic rate measured by
open-circuit indirect calorimetry on the morning after an over-
night fast (ventilated hood system, Quark RMR; COSMED)
before the study period and multiplied by a physical activity
level of 1.35 as estimated for the days in the respiratory chamber.
Physical activity was continuously measured by using a triaxial
activity monitor (ActivPAL; Paltechnologies Ltd.).The time spent
sitting or lying, standing, and stepping and the step numbers were
analyzed. The ActivPAL was worn at the midline of the thigh,
one-third of the way between the hip and knee and fixed with
a waterproof tape according to the recommendation of the
manufacturer.
Body-composition analysis
Examinations took place before the 3-d run-in period after an
overnight fast. Height was measured with a stadiometer (Seca
274; Seca GmbH & Co. KG). Body weight was measured on a
calibrated impedance scale (Seca mBCA 515; Seca GmbH &
Co. KG). Fat mass was assessed by using air-displacement
plethysmography via the BodPod Body Composition System
(COSMED). Fat mass index (FMI) was calculated as fat mass
divided by the square of height (kg/m2).
Twenty-four-hour energy expenditure and substrate
oxidation
The 2 respiratory chambers at the Institute of Nutritional
Medicine at the University of Hohenheim measure 9 m2 and
have a total volume of 21,000 L (D&S Consulting Services,
Inc.). They are furnished with a day bed, chair and desk, com-
puter with Internet access, telephone, toilet, and sink. Air locks
are used for the exchange of food and equipment. Macronutrient
oxidation was determined by measuring oxygen consumption
(VO2) and carbon dioxide production ( _
VCO2) continuously by
the Promethion (model GA-3m2/FG-250) integrated whole-
room indirect calorimeter system (Sable Systems Interna-
tional). This was accomplished by flowing a fixed 80 L fresh
air/min through the metabolic chamber and obtaining a sample
on the exhaust side of the system for measurement of oxygen
and carbon dioxide concentrations (%). The rates of oxygen
consumption and carbon dioxide production were then cal-
culated by using equations derived by Brown et al. (13). The
research-grade instrumentation is accurate to 0.001% for mass
airflow (liters) and oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations.
Moreover, water vapor pressure (kilopascals) of the sample gas
stream was measured directly to 0.001 kpa and used to contin-
uously correct _
VO2 and _
VCO2, along with mass airflow (liters).
This eliminates the need for any type of desiccant to dry the
sample gas stream during metabolic measurements. The lack of
desiccants eliminates any potential errors due to incomplete
removal of moisture before analysis of sample gases and mass
airflow (14). Data acquisition and processing were performed
after completion of each metabolic test by using Sable Systems
ExpeData software (Sable Systems International).
Mean values were obtained from minute-to-minute intervals.
To correct the measured RQ for protein oxidation, nonprotein RQ
(npRQ) was calculated by using nitrogen excretion in 24-h urine.
Macronutrient oxidation was computed according to J´
equier and
Felber (15). During the stay in the respiratory chamber, 24-h
urine samples were collected in polyethylene containers.
Nitrogen excretion in 24-h urine was calculated from photo-
metrically measured urea concentration, and obligate nitrogen
losses by feces and skin were assumed to be +2.5 g N/d (16).
Energy expenditure for 24 h was calculated from _
VO2 and
_
VCO2 and nitrogen excretion to correct for protein metabolism
by using the Weir equation (3.941 3 _
VO2 + 1.106 3 _
VCO2 2
2.17 3 g urinary nitrogen) (17). Twenty-four-hour npRQ and
24-h macronutrient oxidation were assessed from 0600 to 0600
on the following day. Macronutrient and energy balance was
determined by subtracting macronutrient oxidation and energy
expenditure from the respective intake. On 2 days, technical
problems with the power supply occurred. The respiratory
chamber data for these 2 participants were excluded for all days
because of the crossover study design with intraindividual
comparisons. FFAs were measured photometrically, and total
AUC (tAUC) was calculated for 14 h (0700–2100).
Assessment of glucose metabolism and hormonal
measurements
Interstitial glucose concentrations were measured continuously
by using the Dexcom G4 glucose-monitoring device (Dexcom G4
Platinum; Nintamed GmbH & Co. KG) during the entire room-
calorimeter phase. The sensor was applied to the back of the
upper arm to measure interstitial glucose concentrations in the
subcutaneous tissue. Sensor readings were reported every 5 min.
The device was calibrated twice a day by using capillary blood
samples. AUC was calculated as tAUC for the entire intervention
days (0600–0600) by using trapezoidal rule (18). Glucose vari-
ability was assessed by the Mean Amplitude of Glycemic Ex-
cursions (MAGE) (19) by using a published macro (20).
Glucose was measured with the use of a hexokinase method, and
serum insulin was determined by electrochemiluminescence. In-
cremental AUC (iAUC) was calculated by using trapezoidal rule
(18) for 2 h postprandially after lunch on BSD and DSD. HOMA-IR
(21) and the postprandial homeostasis model assessment index
(HOMApp) after lunch (22) on BSD and DSD was determined.
Postprandial iAUCs and HOMApp after lunch were only
assessed on BSD and DSD because of the smaller energy content
of lunch on the control day. Twenty-four-hour insulin secretion
was obtained by 24-h urinary C-peptide excretion by using the
luminescence immunoassay method.

 Cortisol secretion was determined by luminescence immu-
noassay, and tAUC was calculated for 22 h (0700–0500). Ghrelin
was examined by radioimmunoassay, and tAUC was calculated
for 14 h (0700–2100).
SNS activity and autonomic function
Heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed in a continuous
electrocardiographic (ECG) recording by using an autonomic
nervous system recorder (ANS-Recorder Flex BT; Neurocor Ltd. &
Co. KG). Measurements were conducted in a sitting position for
5 min every 2 h throughout the intervention days and every 30 min
after the scheduled meal time for 2 h, even when the meal was
skipped. ECG recordings were made under a nonstressful situation
that we defined as quietly resting in an armchair in the respiratory
chamber with dimmed lighting. The ECG signal was inspected for
artifacts and analyzed by using corresponding NeurocorV R soft-
ware (ANS-Explorer V3.5.11; Neurocor Ltd. & Co. KG). Time-
domain variables included the SD of normal-to-normal intervals
(SDRR; a global measure of overall HRV) and the root-mean-square
difference in successive normal-to-normal intervals (RMSSD; a
measure of parasympathetic activation). As a marker of sym-
pathovagal balance, the ratio of low frequency (LF; 0.04–0.15 Hz)
to high frequency (HF; 0.15–0.4 Hz; LF:HF) was analyzed.
Adrenaline and norepinephrine excretions in 24-h urine were
measured by using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.
Postprandial inflammatory responses in blood cells
To investigate if breakfast skipping changed the re-
sponsiveness of peripheral leukocytes, we used standardized full-
blood assays. These overcome limitations associated with the
classical analysis of cell subpopulations and are highly reliable
and reproducible and less prone to contamination and variability
than the analysis of isolated blood cells (23).
Heparin blood samples were collected before and 30 min, 1 h,
1.5 h, 2 h, and 4 h after lunch on BSD and DSD. Blood was
diluted in culture medium (Roswell Park Memorial Institute
1640; Gibco) and stimulated for 16 h with the T cell mitogen
phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) and the NOD-like receptor
protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activators LPS and nigericin
(both from Invivogen). Cytokine release into the supernatant was
measured by ELISA (IL-6 Duo Set; R&D Systems, Bio-Techne)
and AlphaLISA [IL-1b, interferon g (IFN-g); PerkinElmer],
according to the manufacturers’ protocols. Measurements were
conducted on an Enspire Multimode reader (PerkinElmer).
To analyze the effect of insulin on blood cells, blood of 1 donor
was either incubated for 1 or 2 h with 100 or 200 mU insulin/mL
before cells were stimulated with 10 mg phytohemagglutinin/mL
or mock-treated for 16 h. Subsequently, IL-6 release into the
medium was measured by ELISA (IL-6 Duo Set; R&D Systems,
Bio-Techne).
T cell composition of the peripheral blood was analyzed by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting staining with CD45-Peridinin-
Chlorophyll-protein, CD3–fluorescein isothiocyanate, CD4-
Phycoerythrin, and CD8-Allophycocyanin (all from Miltenyi
Biotec) by using a FACSCanto (BD) device. Briefly, erythrocytes
were lysed (BD FACS Lysing Solution), leukocytes were washed
with fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (phosphate-buffered
saline with 2% fetal calf serum, 2 mmol EDTA/L, and 0.01%
sodium azide) and stained with the antibodies.
Statistical analyses
Together with total energy expenditure, fat oxidation was the
primary outcome variable of the study. It was therefore used for
power analysis. According to the main hypothesis, fat oxidation
was compared between BSD or DSD and the control day. Power
analysis was conducted by using G-Power 3.1.9.2 software
(written by Faul F., University of Kiel, Germany) and a 2-sided t
test for difference between 2 dependent means and an a level of
0.05. Means 6 SDs for fat oxidation (61.9 6 4.6 g/d) were
based on the data of Munsters and Saris (6). To show a 6%
difference in fat oxidation with a power of 80%, a total sample
size of n = 13 was required. Data are reported as means 6 SDs
unless otherwise specified. Normal distribution was checked by
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Repeated-measures ANOVA was
used to examine differences in the variables of energy and
macronutrient balance, glucose metabolism, HRV data, and
catecholamine and cortisol concentrations between the 3 in-
tervention days. Significant effects were followed with pairwise
comparisons and Bonferroni post hoc tests. Differences between
the skipping days in insulin, glucose, and ghrelin concentrations
were analyzed by paired t test, and Wilcoxon’s test was used if
data were not distributed normally. Sex differences in baseline
characteristics were analyzed by using independent-samples
t test. Differences between regular breakfast eaters and occa-
sional breakfast skippers as well as between participants with a
low and high FMI were tested by Mann-Whitney U test. Cor-
relations between npRQ and C-peptide, FFA tAUC, RMSSD,
adrenaline, or norepinephrine as well as correlations between
24-h energy expenditure and adrenaline or norepinephrine were
tested by Spearman’s r and included the data for all intervention
days. Cytokine data were tested by using ANOVA with Tukey’s
post hoc test and were analyzed and visualized by using GraphPad
Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software). All other analyses were conducted
by using SPSS statistical software (version 23; SPSS, Inc.). Sig-
nificance was set at P , 0.05.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in
Table 1. Eight women and 9 men aged 20–31 y participated in
this study. BMI (in kg/m2) and percentage of body fat mass
ranged between 18.3 and 35.0 and 7.4% and 33.9%, respectively.
According to WHO criteria, 3 participants were overweight, 2
were obese, and 1 was underweight.
Dividing men and women into 2 groups according to their
mean FMI showed that there were no differences in meal
skipping–induced changes between the 2 groups in postprandial
glucose iAUC, insulin iAUC, and HOMApp after lunch; 24-h
glycemia; C-peptide excretion; 24-h energy expenditure; or fat
oxidation. However, our study was not powered to detect dif-
ferences between participants with lower and higher FMI.
Therefore, these analyses should be interpreted with caution.
Energy and macronutrient balances
Energy intake (kilocalories) was similar by design for the 3
intervention days (Table 2). Twenty-four-hour energy expendi-
ture (kilocalories) was higher on both skipping days than on the
control day. Energy balance (kilocalories per day) on the control
day was therefore slightly positive and differed from that on the

 skipping days. However, physical activity did not differ between
the skipping days and the control day (number of steps—BSD:
655 6 247; DSD: 710 6 238; and control: 644 6 207 steps/d;
time spent sitting or lying—BSD: 22.3 6 0.7; DSD: 22.1 6 1.1;
and control: 22.3 6 0.8 h/d; time spent standing—BSD: 1.5 6
0.7; DSD: 1.7 6 1.0; and control: 1.6 6 0.8 h/d; time spent
stepping—BSD: 0.2 6 0.1; DSD: 0.2 6 0.1; and control: 0.2 6
0.1 h/d; all n = 15; P . 0.05).
No difference in fasting npRQ was observed between the 3
intervention days (BSD: 0.82 6 0.04; DSD: 0.81 6 0.05; con-
trol: 0.83 6 0.05; P . 0.05). Components of macronutrient
balance are presented in Table 2. Macronutrient intake was
similar between the 3 intervention days. When compared with
the control day, 24-h fat oxidation was higher and 24-h
carbohydrate oxidation was lower on BSD, whereas both vari-
ables did not differ from the control on DSD. FFA tAUC was
higher on BSD and DSD than on the control day. No association
was observed between FFA tAUC and 24-h npRQ. Figure 2
shows the profiles of 24-h fat and carbohydrate oxidation. Even
after lunch, postprandial fat oxidation on the BSD (12.05 6
4.37 g/2 h or 0.1 g/min) was higher than on the control day
(9.64 6 4.14 g/2 h or 0.08 g/min; P . 0.001) or on the DSD (9.92 6
4.67 g/2 h or 0.08 g/min; P . 0.01).
Fat balance was more negative and carbohydrate balance more
positive on the BSD than on the control day (Table 2). On the
DSD, fat and carbohydrate balances did not significantly differ
from that on the control day. Protein oxidation and balance were
both similar between all intervention days.
Impact of meal skipping on autonomic nervous system
activity
Although 24-h adrenaline and norepinephrine excretion did not
differ between the intervention days, significant differences in
diurnal autonomic nervous system activity were shown by heart rate
monitoring, with a higher RMSSD in the morning with breakfast
skipping than with dinner skipping (data not shown). Overall HRV
was higher on the BSD than on the DSD (SDRR; P , 0.05) but not
compared with the control day (Table 2). Mean parasympathetic
tone (RMSSD) and mean sympathovagal balance (LF:HF) did not
differ between the intervention days (both P . 0.05).

 Twenty-four-hour npRQ showed a positive correlation with
parasympathetic tone (r = 0.52, P , 0.001) and an inverse as-
sociation with norepinephrine excretion (r = 20.46, P = 0.002;
Supplemental Figure 2A). A higher norepinephrine excretion
also correlated with a higher 24-h energy expenditure (r = 0.41,
P = 0.005; Supplemental Figure 2B).
Impact of meal skipping on appetite regulation
Ghrelin concentrations were higher in the morning on the BSD
and in the evening on the DSD, equalizing one another to a
similar ghrelin tAUC between the BSD and DSD (Figure 3).
Impact of meal skipping on 24-h and postprandial glucose
metabolism and cortisol concentrations
Variables of fasting and 24-h and postprandial glucose me-
tabolism are shown in Table 3. Fasting insulin sensitivity
(HOMA-IR), 24-h glycemia (tAUC by continuous glucose
monitoring data), and glucose variability (MAGE) as well as
24-h insulin secretion (24-h C-peptide excretion) were all similar
between the intervention days. However, when compared with
dinner skipping, breakfast skipping resulted in higher postprandial
iAUCs of glucose and insulin as well as a higher HOMApp after
lunch. No correlation was observed between C-peptide and 24-h
npRQ. Cortisol tAUC and 24-h cortisol profile did not differ
between intervention days (control: 174 6 57; BSD: 181 6 45;
DSD: 156 6 40 mg/dl 3 22h; P . 0.05).
Impact of meal skipping on postprandial inflammatory
response in blood cells
Mitogenic stimulation of full-blood cultures for 16 h with
phytohemagglutinin significantly induced the secretion of the
proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 in fasting blood. When com-
paring the kinetics of the response toward the fasting condition, a
reduction in IL-6 release in blood drawn within 1 h after the lunch

 was observed, which was significant for 30 min (BSD: P , 0.0001;
DSD: P = 0.0038). By contrast, at later time points, and signifi-
cantly at 4 h postprandially (BSD: P , 0.0001; DSD: P = 0.0013),
the cells were more responsive toward phytohemagglutinin
(Figure 4A). When comparing BSD with DSD, IL-6 responses
were significantly higher at 4 h after lunch when the partici-
pants did not receive a breakfast (P = 0.0042). An overall similar
postprandial response was obtained for the T cell cytokine IFN-g,
albeit no significant differences between BSD and DSD were
shown (Figure 4A).
Because food intake was shown to induce a higher release
of IL-1b on NLRP3 stimulation in human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells and monocytes 3 h postprandially (24), we
decided to include the NLRP3 inflammasome activator nigericin
(+LPS) in our study for a subsample of the study group. Sig-
nificantly higher IL-1b responses (P = 0.0246) were observed
4 h postprandially with breakfast skipping, whereas this differ-
ence was not significant with dinner skipping (Figure 4B). Notably,
for all responses, we observed a trend toward lower cytokine re-
lease from blood cells drawn at earlier time points (30 min to 1 h),
which was significant in some cases.
Next, we addressed whether differences in the abundance of
lymphocyte populations explained our observations because
these were reported to occur after food intake (25–27). We
therefore measured T cell composition of the peripheral blood
used for the stimulation assays from 2 representative donors. No
significant change in the proportion of CD3+ cells from total
lymphocytes was observed (data not shown), which strongly
suggests that the changes in the cytokine concentrations on
phytohemagglutinin stimulation were due to changes in the cell-
intrinsic signaling pathways.
We also tested if insulin might be directly responsible for this
effect by treating blood from a fasting donor at different times for
#4 h with human insulin before stimulating the cells with
phytohemagglutinin. This did not result in any significant
change in IL-6 secretion (Supplemental Figure 3). Moreover,
the kinetics of insulin concentrations did not correlate with the
responsiveness of the leukocytes, suggesting that insulin alone is
not the responsible stimulus for the change in the postprandial
immune response.
DISCUSSION
Contrary to our primary hypothesis, breakfast and dinner
skipping led to a small but significant increased 24-h energy
expenditure (+41 and +91 kcal/d) compared with a conventional
3-meal pattern and thus improved energy balance under condi-
tions of fixed energy intake. Our results are in contrast to previous
controlled studies that used metabolic chambers, which found no
effect of breakfast skipping on energy expenditure compared
with a conventional 3-meal pattern (8) or a high consumption
frequency of 6 (5) or 7 (4) meals. The discrepant results may be
due to methodologic differences between the studies. Taylor and
Garrow (5) examined overweight and obese subjects under

 negative energy balance, and Kobayashi et al. (8) investigated a
small number of participants who had higher 24-h glycemia
with breakfast skipping; in the study by Verboeket-van de
Venne and Westerterp (4), RQ and energy expenditure were
calculated over 3-h intervals only. However, in both of the latter
studies breakfast skipping was found to increase fat oxidation
during the prolonged fasting period until the first meal at 1200.
In the present study, the timing of meal skipping was important
for inducing a change in macronutrient partitioning, because
the increase in 24-h fat oxidation and the corresponding
negative fat balance was significant only for breakfast skipping
but not for dinner skipping.
Both breakfast and dinner skipping led to a longer duration of
the overnight fasting period. Prolonged fasting can be considered

 to be a state of stress that leads to increased adrenergic activity
and thus to higher lipolysis and increased energy expenditure
(28). In line with this finding, concentrations of FFAs (Table 2)
and 24-h energy expenditure were higher on both skipping days.
Twenty-four-hour excretions of adrenaline and norepinephrine
were, however, similar between both intervention days and the 3-
meal control day. Nevertheless, we found that norepinephrine
excretion inversely correlated with npRQ and positively with 24-h
energy expenditure when data from all intervention days were
combined. The individual propensity of meal skipping to increase
norepinephrine concentrations could therefore explain the in-
terindividual variance in fat oxidation and energy expenditure.
In addition to the duration of fasting, the timing of energy
intake could also impact autonomic function and thus affect
diurnal changes in substrate partitioning and energy expenditure.
In line with this assumption, later timing of breakfast and dinner
has been found to cause a phase delay in the diurnal 24-h rhythm
of cardiac autonomic nervous system activity assessed by HRV
(29). Although autonomic regulation assessed by heart rate
monitoring differed between breakfast and dinner skipping
(Table 2) a higher SDRR with breakfast skipping argues
against a higher sympathetic tone and rather suggests improved
autonomic regulation with breakfast skipping.
Lower 24-h insulin secretion due to a prolonged fasting period
with meal skipping could contribute to increased lipolysis-
induced fat oxidation. However, although concentrations of
FFAs and 24-h energy expenditure were higher with both of the
meal skipping days than with the 3-meal control day, 24-h insulin
secretion did not differ between any of the intervention days
(Table 3). Of note, insulin excursions rather than cumulative 24-h
insulin secretion are more important for the regulation of nutrient
partitioning. Although a high frequency of 6, compared with 3,
meals was associated with lower 24-h insulin AUC, at the same
time it caused a marked suppression in 24-h FFA concentrations
between meals. This was due to the fact that frequent eating
prevents a decrease in insulin, which facilitates lipolysis (7). In
addition, a low meal frequency resulted in elevated energy ex-
penditure during the postprandial hours, indicating a greater
contribution of DIT to 24-h energy expenditure (4).
A limitation to our study protocol is that we cannot examine
the effects of meal skipping on voluntary energy intake. Although
ghrelin concentrations were higher in the morning with breakfast
skipping and in the evening with dinner skipping, we found no
differences in the AUC of 24-h ghrelin concentrations between
meal skipping days and the 3-meal control day (see Results).
However, a compensation of a higher energy expenditure and fat
oxidation by a higher spontaneous energy or fat intake under ad
libitum conditions cannot be ruled out. Interestingly, a higher
meal frequency of 14 or 6 meals compared with 3 meals led to
increased ghrelin concentrations (6) and ratings of hunger and
“desire to eat” (6, 7). On the other hand, extending morning
fasting until lunch caused incomplete energy compensation with
an ad libitum lunch (30, 31). Increased hunger and decreased
satiety in response to breakfast skipping were found primarily in
habitual breakfast eaters (32). This may suggest that the effect of
meal skipping on appetite regulatory systems is enhanced in
habitual breakfast eaters. In the present study, no differences
were observed between regular breakfast eaters and occasional
breakfast skippers on meal skipping–induced changes in ghrelin
concentrations, glucose regulation, and 24-h energy expenditure
or fat oxidation (data not shown). An additional limitation of the
present study is the fact that only responses to the first day of
breakfast skipping or dinner skipping were measured and there-
fore the metabolic consequences of habitual breakfast or dinner
skipping remain unclear.
In patients with type 2 diabetes, habitual breakfast skipping
was associated with a later chronotype (a preference for later bed
and wake times) that contributed to poorer glycemic control (33).
A disrupted circadian clock provides a mechanistic explanation
for the relation between a disturbed diurnal eating pattern and
alterations in glucose metabolism (34). Glucose metabolism is
highly circadian (35) and depends largely on the timing and
composition of nutrient ingestion. Because the body uses nutrient
input to set circadian rhythms (36), it is possible that both timing
and nutrient composition of the diet might be important for the
prevention of metabolic disturbances.
In line with impaired metabolic function with breakfast
skipping, randomized controlled trials support higher glucose
variability in lean subjects and impaired insulin sensitivity in
obese participants who skip breakfast when compared with those
who eat breakfast but found no effect on body weight or fat mass
over a 6-wk period (31, 37). In support of impaired glucose
homeostasis with breakfast skipping, HOMApp and glucose
concentrations after lunch were higher with breakfast skipping
than with dinner skipping (Table 3). Compared with dinner
skipping, higher postprandial fat oxidation at lunchtime after
breakfast skipping occurred despite increased insulin concen-
trations and suggests metabolic inflexibility after prolonged
fasting. The mitochondrial capacity to switch freely between
oxidative fuels in the transition from fasting to feeding is
therefore lost (38). In a healthy, metabolically flexible state, the
consumption of a high-carbohydrate meal results in an increase in
blood insulin concentrations and respiratory quotient, indicative
of a robust shift from fatty acid to glucose oxidation. Increased
fat oxidation, despite higher postprandial insulin concentrations
with breakfast skipping, suggests the development of metabolic
inflexibility in response to prolonged fasting that may increase
metabolic risk over time.
We also found that a longer fasting period with breakfast
skipping increased inflammasome activity and inflammatory
responses of peripheral leukocytes after lunch at later time points
(Figure 4). Our data thereby showed reduced inflammatory ac-
tivity at earlier times after food intake and higher responses at
later time points. Higher postprandial NLRP3-dependent IL-1b
secretion has also been reported recently by others (24). Because
chronic low-grade inflammation is known to impair insulin
sensitivity, enhanced postprandial inflammation could contribute
to metabolic impairment with breakfast skipping. It is known
that peripheral monocytes are activated after food intake and
secrete more inflammatory cytokines than with fasting condi-
tions (for review see reference 39), which might be even more
pronounced in diabetic patients (40). The underlying stimuli for
this activation, however, remain largely elusive. The generation
of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes (41) and higher gut
microbiota–derived LPS in the serum after feeding (42) have
been discussed as possible mechanisms. Most available experi-
mental data, however, support that FFAs from macronutrient
uptake might be responsible for postprandial inflammation.
Although some concepts are emerging, SFAs can activate Toll-
like receptor (TLR) 4 (43) and FFAs synergize with high glucose

 concentrations to amplify reactive oxygen species generation
and inflammatory responses mediated by TLR2/6 and myeloid
differentiation factor 2 (MD2)/TLR4 in vitro (44). Moreover, G
protein–coupled FFA receptors, such as GPR43, can induce in-
flammatory responses in leukocytes (45). Increased lipolysis and
FFA concentrations with extended fasting with breakfast skip-
ping may therefore be causal for the observed effects.
Altogether, the present results support the association between
breakfast skipping and disturbed glucose homeostasis, which is
not explained by a positive energy balance. On the contrary, both
breakfast skipping and dinner skipping increased total energy
expenditure. In conclusion, a causal role of breakfast skipping for
the development of obesity is not supported by the present data.
