people aged 20 to 64: cohort study using primary care database
Carol Coupland,1 Trevor Hill,1 Richard Morriss,2 Michael Moore,3 Antony Arthur,4 Julia Hippisley-Cox1 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To assess associations between different 
antidepressant treatments and rates of three 
cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction, stroke 
or transient ischaemic attack, and arrhythmia) in 
people with depression.
Design
Cohort study.
setting
UK general practices contributing to the QResearch 
primary care database.
PartiCiPants
238 963 patients aged 20 to 64 years with a first 
diagnosis of depression between 1 January 2000 and 
31 July 2011.
exPOsures
Antidepressant class (tricyclic and related 
antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors, other antidepressants), dose, duration of 
use, and commonly prescribed individual 
antidepressant drugs.
Main OutCOMe Measures
First diagnoses of myocardial infarction, stroke or 
transient ischaemic attack, and arrhythmia during five 
years’ follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models 
were used to estimate hazard ratios, adjusting for 
potential confounding variables.
results
During five years of follow-up, 772 patients had a 
myocardial infarction, 1106 had a stroke or transient 
ischaemic attack, and 1452 were diagnosed as having 
arrhythmia. No significant associations were found 
between antidepressant class and myocardial 
infarction over five years’ follow-up. In the first year of 
follow-up, patients treated with selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors had a significantly reduced risk of 
myocardial infarction (adjusted hazard ratio 0.58, 95% 
confidence interval 0.42 to 0.79) compared with no 
use of antidepressants; among individual drugs, 
fluoxetine was associated with a significantly reduced 
risk (0.44, 0.27 to 0.72) and lofepramine with a 
significantly increased risk (3.07, 1.50 to 6.26). No 
significant associations were found between 
antidepressant class or individual drugs and risk of 
stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Antidepressant 
class was not significantly associated with arrhythmia 
over five years’ follow-up, although the risk was 
significantly increased during the first 28 days of 
treatment with tricyclic and related antidepressants 
(adjusted hazard ratio 1.99, 1.27 to 3.13). Fluoxetine 
was associated with a significantly reduced risk of 
arrhythmia (0.74, 0.59 to 0.92) over five years, but 
citalopram was not significantly associated with risk of 
arrhythmia even at high doses (1.11, 0.72 to 1.71 for 
doses ≥40 mg/day).
COnClusiOns
This study found no evidence that selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors are associated with an increased 
risk of arrhythmia or stroke/transient ischaemic attack 
in people diagnosed as having depression between 
the ages of 20 to 64 or that citalopram is associated 
with a significantly increased risk of arrhythmia. It 
found some indication of a reduced risk of myocardial 
infarction with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 
particularly fluoxetine, and of an increased risk with 
lofepramine.
Introduction
Depression is a common and debilitating condition, 
which is often treated with antidepressants. Depres-
sion increases the risk of cardiovascular outcomes, but 
controversy exists as to whether use of antidepres-
sants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tors, increases or reduces the risk.1 2  This is important 
because antidepressants are one of the most com-
monly prescribed types of drug worldwide, and their 
use is increasing.3-5 In the United States, antidepres-
sants were the third most commonly used prescription 
drug in 2005-08, and their use had increased by almost 
400% compared with 1988-946 ; in England, more than 
53 million prescriptions for antidepressants were 
issued in 2013,7  nearly a twofold increase compared 
with a decade earlier.8 More than half (54%) of the pre-
scriptions in England in 2013 were for selective sero-
tonin reuptake inhibitors, including nearly 14 million 
prescriptions for the most commonly prescribed anti-
depressant citalopram.
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Depression is a common condition, and antidepressants—particularly selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors—are increasingly used in its treatment
Rates of cardiovascular disease are higher in people with depression, but whether 
different antidepressant treatments increase or reduce these rates is unclear
High doses of certain antidepressants, including citalopram, can cause QT 
prolongation, which may increase the risk of arrhythmia, but this is not established
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
This study found no evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as a class 
are associated with an increased risk of arrhythmia and stroke or transient 
ischaemic attack in people with depression aged 20 to 64
No evidence was found that citalopram is associated with a significantly increased 
risk of arrhythmia, even at high doses
Some indication was seen of a reduced risk of myocardial infarction for selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, particularly fluoxetine

2
Theoretically, antidepressants such as selective 
 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors may have effects on 
 
coagulation, and some studies have explored their car-
dioprotective effect. These studies have tended to be 
underpowered and explored outcomes in secondary 
care or other selected populations. Randomised con-
trolled trials of antidepressants tend to be short term 
and underpowered to detect effects on cardiovascular 
outcomes, and observational studies of cardiovascular 
outcomes show conflicting results and many have not 
accounted for depression and so are susceptible to 
indication biases. The observational studies have 
either been restricted to or predominantly included 
older people, so uncertainty exists about associations 
in a younger age group, although antidepressants are 
often prescribed for depression in adults of working 
age. Antidepressants may have differential effects on 
cardiovascular outcomes according to age. A 
meta-analysis of 13 observational studies found that 
use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was asso-
ciated with a 40% increased risk of stroke, but this was 
significant only in studies restricted to older age groups 
and no significantly increased risk was seen in studies 
with no age restriction, although none of the studies 
specifically focused on a younger age group.9  Simi-
larly, for myocardial infarction, uncertainty exists 
about an association with selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors. A large observational study in people aged 
65 and over with depression found an increased risk of 
myocardial infarction with selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors,10  whereas other studies in broader age 
groups have found no association or reduced risks,11-13 
which could be a result of differing age ranges or indi-
cation biases.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued 
a drug safety communication in 2011, stating that cit-
alopram should not be prescribed at doses greater 
than 40 mg per day, based on findings of QT interval 
prolongation in a study of 119 participants who 
received different doses of citalopram.14  The Euro-
pean Medicines Agency issued a similar safety warn-
ing in 2011. Further studies have reported QT interval 
prolongation with citalopram and also with some 
other antidepressants such as escitalopram and 
 
amitriptyline.15 16  QT interval prolongation can lead to 
arrhythmias including potentially fatal torsades de 
pointes,17  but few studies have specifically assessed 
risk of arrhythmia for different antidepressant drugs. 
A cohort study in predominantly older men of two dif-
ferent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antide-
pressants found significantly lower risks of arrhythmia 
for doses of citalopram over 40 mg/day compared with 
doses of 1-20 mg/day, with similar findings for ser-
traline.18  A cohort study based on claims data in the 
United States found no significant differences in risk 
of ventricular arrhythmia/sudden death for 20 types of 
antidepressant drug compared with paroxetine, 
except for a higher risk in mirtazapine users.19
Few observational studies of cardiovascular effects 
have examined associations with individual drugs, 
so evidence for specific commonly prescribed 
 
antidepressants is lacking, especially in younger peo-
ple, as is evidence in relation to duration and dose. We 
therefore carried out a cohort study in people aged 20 to 
64 to investigate the associations between different 
antidepressant drugs and the risk of myocardial infarc-
tion, arrhythmia, and stroke/transient ischaemic attack 
and also examined both dose and duration of use.
Methods
The cohort study was designed to estimate associations 
between antidepressant treatment and several different 
adverse outcomes including arrhythmia, myocardial 
infarction, and stroke or transient ischaemic attack. 
Full details of the study design, outcomes, and methods 
can be found in the study protocol.20  Results relating to 
the epilepsy, suicide, and self harm outcomes have 
been published previously.21

study cohort
The study cohort was selected from a large primary care 
database (QResearch, version 34). At the time of the 
study, the QResearch database contained the anony-
mised longitudinal health records of more than 12 mil-
lion patients from more than 600 general practices 
across the United Kingdom, which record data using 
the Egton Medical Information Systems (EMIS) medical 
records computer system. Recorded information 
includes patients’ characteristics, clinical diagnoses, 
symptoms, and prescribed drugs.
The cohort included patients with a first computer 
recorded diagnosis of depression between the ages of 
20 and 64 years at the time of diagnosis, from 1 January 
2000 to 31 July 2011, as described previously.22 
 
We identified patients with a diagnosis of depression 
by using diagnostic Read codes used in previous stud-
ies.10 23 24 Read codes are the clinical codes used in 
general practice in the United Kingdom. Patients were 
eligible for inclusion if their diagnosis of depression 
occurred at least 12 months after their registration 
with a study practice and the installation date of their 
practice’s EMIS computer system. We restricted our 
cohort to patients with a first recorded diagnosis of 
depression so that antidepressant prescribing during 
follow-up would not be influenced by any previous 
experiences and preferences that would be difficult to 
account for in the analyses. We used the 12 month 
inclusion criterion to ensure that the diagnosis of 
depression was not a retrospective recording of a pre-
vious diagnosis.
We excluded patients with a previous recorded diag-
nosis of depression; those with a diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia, bipolar disorder, or another type of psychosis; 
and those who had received prescriptions for lithium or 
antimanic drugs. We also excluded patients if they had 
received prescriptions for an antidepressant before the 
study start date (1 January 2000), before their registra-
tion date, before they were aged 20, or more than 36 
months before their first recorded diagnosis of depres-
sion. Temporary residents were also excluded.
The patient’s study entry date was the earliest of the 
date of the first recorded diagnosis of depression or the

date of the first prescription for an antidepressant. Par-
ticipants in the cohort were followed up until the earli-
est of date of death, date of leaving the practice, or the 
end of the follow-up period (1 August 2012).
Outcomes
The three outcomes for these analyses were arrhythmia, 
myocardial infarction, and stroke or transient isch-
aemic attack. We identified patients with these out-
comes if they were recorded either on their general 
practice record using the relevant Read codes or on 
their linked Office of National Statistics cause of death 
record using ICD (international classification of dis-
eases) diagnostic codes, based on codes used in previ-
ous studies,25-27 as listed in the web appendix. For the 
analysis of each separate outcome, we considered only 
the first event and excluded patients with a previous 
diagnosis of the outcome recorded at baseline.
exposures
We extracted information on all prescriptions for anti-
depressants during follow-up. We calculated the dura-
tion of each prescription by dividing the number of 
tablets prescribed by the number to be taken each day.22
For the main analyses, we grouped antidepressant 
drugs according to the four main classes in the 
 
British National Formulary: tricyclic and related anti-
depressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and other antide-
pressants. We classified prescriptions for different 
antidepressant drugs on the same date as combined 
prescriptions.
We calculated the daily dose of each prescription by 
multiplying the number of tablets to be taken each day 
by the dose of each tablet, and we converted this to a 
defined daily dose to enable comparison of doses 
between antidepressant classes, using values assigned 
by the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Cen-
tre for Drug Statistics Methodology (www.whocc.no/
atc_ddd_index). For some prescriptions, the dosing 
instructions were missing or not sufficiently detailed to 
allow calculation of a daily dose (<5% of total prescrip-
tions). We also assessed the 11 most frequently pre-
scribed individual antidepressant drugs.10

Confounding variables
We extracted data on variables considered to be poten-
tial risk factors for the cardiovascular outcomes or asso-
ciated with the likelihood of receiving a particular 
antidepressant treatment, based on our previous study 
of antidepressants in people aged 65 or over.10  These 
were age at study entry (continuous); sex; year of diag-
nosis of depression (continuous); severity of index 
diagnosis of depression (categorised as mild, moderate, 
or severe, using the classification of Read codes for 
depression published by Martinez and colleagues23  and 
additional classification by a member of the study team 
(RM) of some Read codes for depression used in our 
study21 but not included in the study by Martinez); 
deprivation (Townsend deprivation score correspond-
ing to the patient’s postcode, in fifths); smoking status 
(non-smoker, ex-smoker, light smoker (1-9 cigarettes/
day), moderate smoker (10-19 cigarettes/day), heavy 
smoker (≥20 cigarettes/day), not recorded); alcohol 
intake (none, trivial (<1 unit/day), light (1-2 units/day), 
medium (3-6 units/day), heavy (7-9 units/day), very 
heavy (>9 units/day), not recorded); ethnic group (cate-
gorised into a binary variable of white/not recorded or 
non-white (comprising Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, 
other Asian, black African, black Caribbean, Chinese, 
other including mixed)); comorbidities at baseline 
(individual binary variables for each of coronary heart 
disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, epilepsy/sei-
zures, hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid 
arthritis, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease, osteoporosis, liver disease, renal disease, obses-
sive-compulsive disorder); and use of other drugs at 
baseline (individual binary variables for each of 
 
antihypertensives, aspirin, statins, anticoagulants, 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticonvul-
sants, hypnotics/anxiolytics, antipsychotics, bisphos-
phonates, oral contraceptives, hormone replacement 
therapy). In addition, for the arrhythmia and myocar-
dial infarction outcomes, we adjusted for a diagnosis of 
stroke or transient ischaemic attack at baseline. We 
included year of diagnosis of depression as a confound-
ing variable to account for changes in prescribing pat-
terns over time.
statistical analysis
We used Cox’s proportional hazards models to estimate 
associations between the three outcomes and exposure 
to antidepressant drugs, treating antidepressant expo-
sure as a time varying exposure to allow for patients 
starting and stopping and also changing between treat-
ments during follow-up. We used robust standard errors 
to allow for clustering of patients within practices. We 
excluded patients from the analysis of each outcome if 
they had the outcome recorded at baseline. We classified 
patients as exposed to an antidepressant if no gaps of 
more than 90 days existed between the end of one pre-
scription and the start of the next. If gaps of more than 90 
days occurred, patients counted as exposed for the first 
90 days and then unexposed for the remaining period. 
When patients stopped an antidepressant, we classified 
them as exposed for the first 90 days after the estimated 
date of stopping, so that outcomes occurring during 
withdrawal periods would be attributed to the antide-
pressant. The main analyses were based on the first five 
years of follow-up after study entry, and patients were 
censored at the earliest of five years after study entry, 
date of death, date of leaving the practice, or the end of 
the follow-up period in these analyses. We selected five 
years of follow-up for our main analyses as this would 
incorporate periods of long term treatment and also 
allow for more events to accrue than a shorter follow-up 
period would, so increasing the power of the study.
The analyses calculated unadjusted and adjusted 
hazard ratios for each antidepressant class (tricyclic 
and related antidepressants, selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors, other antidepressants, combined 
treatment) compared with periods of no antidepressant

treatment. The unexposed reference category included 
periods of unexposed time in patients treated at other 
periods of time during follow-up, as well as person 
years from patients who received no antidepressant 
treatment throughout follow-up, so the hazard ratios 
compare rates of the outcomes between exposed and 
unexposed periods of time throughout follow-up. 
Patients who received monoamine oxidase inhibitors at 
any time were excluded from these analyses, as the 
number in this category was small. We excluded 
patients with missing deprivation scores from the 
adjusted analyses. Analyses were carried out for time 
varying exposures of prescribed daily dose (categorised 
as ≤0.5, >0.5 and ≤1.0, and >1.0 defined daily doses), 
and we calculated tests for trend within each drug class 
by using dose as a continuous variable. Periods of 
 
exposure time for which daily dose was missing were 
excluded from the analysis of dose. We did additional 
analyses for time since starting treatment (categorised 
as no use or treatment duration of 1-28 days, 29-84 days, 
or ≥85 days) and time since stopping treatment (1-28 
days, 29-84 days, and 85-182 days after the estimated 
date of stopping treatment) and for the 11 most com-
monly prescribed individual antidepressants, as in a 
previous study.10  Individual antidepressants were fur-
ther categorised by dose (≤1 or >1 defined daily doses), 
and citalopram was also categorised as ≤20 mg/day, 
20-39 mg/day, and ≥40 mg/day for an analysis of the 
arrhythmia outcome, in light of the FDA’s drug safety 
communication.28
We used Wald’s significance tests to identify signifi-
cant differences between antidepressant classes and 
between individual antidepressant drugs. We tested for 
interactions between class of antidepressant and age 
and sex. We assessed the proportional hazards assump-
tion by using log minus log plots.
As sensitivity analyses, we repeated the analyses 
including the entire follow-up period and did an anal-
ysis excluding patients who received no antidepres-
sant prescriptions during follow-up.22 We repeated our 
main analyses using selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors as the comparison group for drug class, the 
middle dose category of selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors as the comparison group for drug dose, and 
citalopram (the most commonly prescribed antide-
pressant) as the comparison group for individual anti-
depressants.
We also did an analysis restricted to the first year of 
follow-up; we did this because we had some evidence 
of non-proportional hazards over five years of fol-
low-up, and also this time period more closely 
reflected the average duration of treatment. As a post 
hoc analysis, we also estimated adjusted hazard ratios 
separately using interaction terms for the 0-1 years, 1-3 
years, and 3-5 years after the start of follow-up to fur-
ther investigate changes in hazard ratios over time. We 
did these analyses for drug class and for only the five 
most frequently prescribed antidepressants owing to 
the smaller numbers of events in the later time peri-
ods. To examine the effect of adjusting for different 
confounding variables, we did additional analyses 
entering the variables in blocks. As a post hoc analy-
sis, we used a stratified Cox model, with stratification 
by general practice to compare with our main models 
using robust standard errors to account for clustering 
by practice.
We calculated absolute risks of the three outcomes 
over one year, accounting for the confounding variables 
by using the adjusted hazard ratios from the analyses 
based on one year of follow-up, according to the method 
described by Altman et al.29
We included all eligible patients in the database in 
our analyses to maximise power. We used a P value of 
<0.01 (two tailed) to determine statistical significance. 
We used Stata (v12.1) for all analyses.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures, nor were they 
involved in the design or implementation of the study. 
No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or 
writing up of results. Patient representatives from the 
QResearch Advisory Board have advised on dissemi-
nation of studies using QResearch data, including the 
use of lay summaries describing the research and its 
results.
Results
The initial cohort included 327 235 patients with a first 
diagnosis of depression made between the ages of 20 
and 64, between 1 January 2000 and 31 July 2011. We 
excluded 88 272 (27.0%) patients because they had 
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other psychoses; 
had been treated with lithium or antimanic drugs; or 
had received a prescription for an antidepressant before 
the study entry date, before age 20, or more than 36 
months before their date of diagnosis of depression. 
This left 238 963 patients from 687 practices in the final 
study cohort.
The total length of follow-up was 1 307 326 person 
years. Among patients in the cohort 123 038 (51.5%) 
had at least five years of follow-up, with a median of 
5.2 (interquartile range 2.5-8.2) years overall. The mean 
age of patients in the study cohort was 39.5 (SD 11.1) 
years, and 61% were women (table 1). Townsend depri-
vation score was missing for 8201 (3.4%) patients.
antidepressant treatment during follow-up
During follow-up, 209 476 (87
.7%) patients received a 
total of 3 337 336 antidepressant prescriptions. These 
comprised 2 379 668 (71.3%) prescriptions for selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 533 798 (16.0%) for tricy-
clic and related antidepressants, and 422 079 (12.7%) for 
the group of other antidepressants. In addition, 156 
patients had received a total of 1791 (0.05%) prescrip-
tions for monoamine oxidase inhibitors. There were 
83 784 combined prescriptions for two or more different 
antidepressant drugs prescribed on the same day. The 
median duration of treatment during follow-up was 221 
(interquartile range 79-590) days.

bined prescriptions counting as single prescriptions),

citalopram was the most commonly prescribed antide-
pressant (1 023 255 (31.5%) prescriptions) followed by 
fluoxetine (778 285; 23.9%), and then amitriptyline 
(236 416; 7
.3%). Supplementary table A shows numbers 
of prescriptions for the 11 most commonly prescribed 
antidepressants, with information on prescribed daily 
doses. Distributions of baseline characteristics accord-
ing to the first antidepressant prescribed for these 11 
drugs have been presented in a previous paper.22
associations with arrhythmia
At baseline, 2373 patients had an existing diagnosis of 
arrhythmia. We excluded these patients from analysis 
of the arrhythmia outcome, along with the patients who 
received prescriptions for monoamine oxidase inhibi-
tors, leaving 236 434 patients in the analysis cohort. 
During the first five years of follow-up, 1452 new diagno-
ses of arrhythmia were made, giving an incidence rate 
of 16.2 per 10 000 person years (20.1 per 10 000 in men 
and 13.8 per 10 000 in women).
We found no significant associations with arrhythmia 
(at P<0.01) for any of the drug classes over five years 
compared with periods of no antidepressant treatment, 
as shown in table 2, although we saw some indication of 
a reduced hazard ratio for selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio 0.84, 95% confidence 
interval 0.73 to 0.97; P=0.02) compared with no current 
use of antidepressants. In a direct comparison with 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (supplementary 
table B), we found a significantly increased rate for the 
group of other antidepressants (adjusted hazard ratio 
1.44, 1.12 to 1.85).
We found no significant trends with dose in the three 
drug classes (table 2). A significant increase in the rate 
of arrhythmia occurred in the first 28 days after starting 
treatment with tricyclic and related antidepressants 
(adjusted hazard ratio 1.99, 1.27 to 3.13; P=0.003), as 
well as a significant reduction from 84 days after start-
ing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (0.78, 0.66 to 
0.92; P=0.004).
In the analysis of the 11 most commonly prescribed 
drugs, we found significant differences between the 
drugs overall (P=0.004) but no significant difference 
between the four tricyclic and related antidepressants 
(P=0.22) or the five selective serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tors (P=0.39), although we saw a significantly decreased 
risk for fluoxetine (adjusted hazard ratio 0.74, 0.59 to 
0.92; P=0.008) and some indication of an increased risk 
for lofepramine (1.67
, 1.01 to 2.76; P=0.05) compared 
with periods of no antidepressant treatment (fig 1).
In an analysis of dose for individual antidepressants 
(table 3), rates of arrhythmia were not significantly 
increased for higher doses of citalopram (adjusted haz-
ard ratio 1.08, 0.74 to 1.57
, for doses >20 mg/day) or 
escitalopram (1.06, 0.52 to 2.16, for doses >10 mg/day), 
but we found a significant increase for lower doses of 
lofepramine (3.89, 1.92 to 7
.90, for doses ≤105 mg/day) 
and a significantly reduced risk for lower doses of fluox-
etine (0.72, 0.56 to 0.91, for doses ≤20 mg/day). Even for 
doses of citalopram of 40 mg/day or greater, we saw no 
significantly increased risk (adjusted hazard ratio 1.11,

(n=28) (supplementary table C).
Adjusted hazard ratios were similar when patients 
who had not received any prescriptions for antide-
pressants during follow-up were removed from the 
analysis (supplementary table D) and when the entire 
follow-up period was used (supplementary table E), 
although more associations were significant owing to 
larger  
numbers. When we used just the first year of 
follow-up (table 4), results were similar to the five 
year analysis, although the hazard ratio for combined 
antidepressant use was higher (adjusted hazard ratio

oxetine was no longer statistically significant (0.79, 
0.55 to 1.13; P=0.19). We found no indication 
of non-proportional hazards for the arrhythmia 
 
outcome; separate results for years 0-1, 1-3, and 3-5 of 
follow-up are shown in supplementary tables F and G.
associations with myocardial infarction
At baseline, 1790 patients had a previous diagnosis of 
myocardial infarction recorded. We excluded these 
patients from analysis of the myocardial infarction 
 
outcome, along with the patients who received mono-
amine oxidase inhibitors, leaving 237 017 patients in 
the analysis cohort. During the first five years of fol-
low-up, 772 new diagnoses of myocardial infarction 
were made, giving an incidence rate of 8.6 per 10 000 
person years (16.2 per 10 000 in men and 3.9 per 10 000 
in women).
We found no significant association between antide-
pressant class and myocardial infarction over five years 
in the adjusted analysis (table 5) and no significant 
trends with dose. No clear pattern in risk according to 
different periods of time after starting or stopping anti-
depressant drugs was apparent, although rates were 
increased from 28 days after stopping tricyclic and 
related antidepressants.

We found no significant associations (at P<0.01) for 
individual drugs in the adjusted analyses (fig 2) and no 
significant difference between the five selective sero-
tonin reuptake inhibitors (P=0.27) or the four tricyclic 
and related antidepressants (P=0.26), although fluoxe-
tine had an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.73 (0.54 to 0.98; 
P=0.04) and lofepramine had an adjusted hazard ratio 
of 2.02 (1.14 to 3.59; P=0.02), both compared with peri-
ods of no antidepressant treatment.
Adjusted hazard ratios were similar when patients 
who had not received any antidepressant prescrip-
tions during follow-up were removed from the analysis 
(supplementary table H) and when the entire fol-
low-up period was used (supplementary table I). We 
saw some indication that hazard rates were not pro-
portional over the five years of follow-up, and some 
differences in the hazard ratios were apparent when 
the analysis was restricted to the first year of follow-up

analysis (table 4), we found a significantly reduced 
risk for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors com-
pared with no use of antidepressants (adjusted hazard 
ratio 0.58, 0.42 to 0.79; P=0.001); although overall no 
significant difference (at P<0.01) existed between the 
five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (P=0.11) or 
the four tricyclic and related antidepressants (P=0.03), 
a significant reduction occurred with fluoxetine 
(adjusted hazard ratio 0.44, 0.27 to 0.72; P=0.001) and 
a significant increase with lofepramine (3.07, 1.50 to

with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in years 
1-3 and 3-5 of follow-up (supplementary table F) or 
with fluoxetine (supplementary table G).
associations with stroke/transient ischaemic 
attack
At baseline, 1741 patients had a diagnosis of stroke or 
transient ischaemic attack recorded. These patients 
were excluded from analysis of the stroke/transient 
ischaemic attack outcome, along with the patients who 
received monoamine oxidase inhibitors, leaving 237 067 
patients in the analysis cohort. During the first five 
years of follow-up, 1106 new diagnoses of stroke or tran-
sient ischaemic attack were made, giving an incidence 
rate of 12.3 per 10 000 person years (17
.3 per 10 000 in 
men and 9.3 per 10 000 in women).
We found no significant associations between antide-
pressant class and stroke/transient ischaemic attack 
over five years and no significant trends (at P<0.01) with 
dose (table 6). A significant increase in risk occurred 
during the first 28 days after starting other antidepres-
sants (adjusted hazard ratio 2.72, 1.45 to 5.08; P=0.002) 
and from 85 to 182 days after stopping tricyclic and 
related antidepressants (1.82, 1.21 to 2.74; P=0.004). 
Rates were also increased in the first 84 days after start-
ing tricyclic and related antidepressants, although not 
significantly (at P<0.01).
In the adjusted analysis of individual antidepressant 
drugs, we found no significant associations for any of 
the drugs (fig 3).
Adjusted hazard ratios were similar when patients 
who had not received any prescriptions for antidepres-
sants during follow-up were removed (supplementary 
table J) and when the entire follow-up period was used 
(supplementary table K), but they tended to be lower 
when just the first year of follow-up was used in the 
analysis (table 4). We saw some indication that hazard 
rates were not proportional over the five years of follow- 
up, with higher hazard ratios in the later periods of fol-
low-up for tricyclic and related antidepressants and 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (supplementary 
tables F and G).
additional analyses
The results of analyses including confounding variables 
in blocks are shown in supplementary tables L to N, 
showing that adjustment for age, sex, deprivation, eth-
nic group, and year of diagnosis had a marked effect on 
hazard ratios, but additional adjustment for further 
blocks of variables had a relatively small effect. Results 
were similar to those of our main models which used 
robust standard errors when the Cox models were strat-
ified by general practice.
absolute risks
Table 7 shows absolute risks of the three outcomes over 
one year by antidepressant class and for the individual 
drugs. Absolute risks of arrhythmia and myocardial 
infarction were highest for lofepramine (30 per 10 000 
and 31 per 10 000, respectively), and for stroke/tran-
sient ischaemic attack they were highest for mirtazap-
ine (24 per 10 000). However, the 95% confidence 
intervals for these values were wide and mainly over-
lapped with the other drugs.
discussion
The main findings of this large population based cohort 
study were that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
were not associated with an increased risk of arrhyth-
mia, myocardial infarction, or stroke or transient isch-
aemic attack in a general population cohort of people 
with depression aged 20 to 64 and that risk of arrhyth-
mia was not significantly increased in patients treated 
with citalopram even at high doses (40 mg/day and 
over), although numbers in this category were rela-
tively small. We found some evidence that selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with a 
reduced risk of arrhythmia and myocardial infarction. 
Fluoxetine was associated with the lowest risks of 
these two outcomes, but overall no significant differ-
ences were seen between the selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors. The risk of arrhythmia was signifi-
cantly increased in the first four weeks of starting tricy-
clic and related  
antidepressants, and the tricyclic drug 
lofepramine was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of myocardial infarction in the first year 
of follow-up.
strengths and limitations of study
This study included a large representative sample of 
people aged 20 to 64 diagnosed as having depression in 
the general UK population and had a long follow-up 
period. All eligible patients were included, so no bias 
due to non-response was present, and no recall bias 
occurred because data on prescriptions and confound-
ing variables were recorded prospectively before the 
outcomes occurred. We reduced indication bias by 
restricting our cohort to include only patients with a 
diagnosis of depression, as depression itself is an estab-
lished risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes,30 
31 and 
separating the effects of antidepressant treatment from 
those of depression would otherwise be difficult. This 
means that our findings can be generalised only to peo-
ple diagnosed as having depression.

Some bias may remain in comparisons between anti-
depressant drugs if the selection of a particular antide-
pressant was influenced by risk factors for the outcome, 
but we accounted for a large number of potential con-
founding variables in the analysis to reduce differences 
between comparison groups. The increased risk for 
lofepramine in some analyses may nevertheless reflect 
preferential selection of this drug in patients consid-
ered to be more prone to arrhythmias or heart disease, 
as this drug is viewed as being safer in overdose and

less cardiotoxic than other tricyclic and related antide-
pressants.32 
33  The increased risk of arrhythmia for low 
doses of lofepramine but not higher doses supports 
this, whereby patients at highest risk are treated with 
lower doses, although numbers of events were small in 
both dose categories. However, in a comparison of base-
line characteristics of patients who received prescrip-
tions for different antidepressants, we saw no indication 
that lofepramine was prescribed more frequently than 
other tricyclic antidepressants to patients with cardio-
vascular risk factors.22  For example, among patients 
whose first antidepressant prescription was for 
lofepramine, 1.1% had coronary heart disease com-
pared with 2.1% for amitriptyline, and 0.8% had a pre-
vious stroke recorded compared with 1.0% for 
amitriptyline. Similarly, we observed no indication that 
fluoxetine was prescribed more frequently than other 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors to younger 
patients or patients with fewer cardiovascular risk fac-
tors. For example, the mean age of patients when first 
treated with fluoxetine was 38.8 years, compared with 
39.8 for citalopram and 38.3 for paroxetine, and the pro-
portion of patients with hypertension when first treated 
with fluoxetine was 6.7%, whereas for paroxetine it was 
5.3%.22
Some residual confounding may still be present 
owing to variables that either were not recorded on the 
database, such as dietary factors and physical activity, 
or were not recorded in sufficient detail for their con-
founding effect to be completely removed by analysis. 
Although we adjusted for severity of depression, this 
was based on a basic classification of diagnostic Read 
codes for depression, as depression severity scores are 
not routinely recorded in general practice. Numbers of 
patients in the different non-white ethnic groups were 
small, so we combined these for inclusion in the analy-
sis, which may contribute to residual confounding. 
Some misclassification of the antidepressant exposure 
variables will have occurred, as some patients may not 
have taken their prescribed antidepressant or may not 
have taken it at the prescribed dose. This misclassifica-
tion could underestimate associations with drug use. 
Furthermore, although the cohort was large, the num-
ber of events was small for some of the antidepressant 
exposure categories. In particular, there were relatively 
few prescriptions for citalopram at doses of 40 mg/day 
or more (19% of citalopram prescriptions), and only 28 
diagnoses of arrhythmia in this category, so the 95% 
confidence interval for risk of arrhythmia with high 
doses of citalopram is wide, and increases in risk of up 
to 71% cannot be excluded.
The outcomes were not formally adjudicated in this 
study, but validation studies in other UK primary care 
databases have shown high levels of validity across a 
range of diseases, and we would expect levels of valid-
ity to be similar in QResearch.34 35  For example, Khan 
reported high positive predictive values in validation 
studies of acute myocardial infarction and cerebrovas-
cular disease.35  A study validating diagnostic codes for 
ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death 
reported a positive predictive value of 93%.36 We 
included information from death certificates to identify 
additional patients with the outcomes, which will have 
increased ascertainment and reduced misclassification.
Comparison with other studies
Our results for arrhythmia are consistent with those of 
two other large cohort studies in finding no increased 
risk for citalopram,18 19  even at high doses, and our 
rates of arrhythmia are of the same order of magni-
tude. Our study adds new information on risks associ-
ated with other antidepressant drugs and on effects of

duration of treatment. Our findings contrast to some 
extent with those of studies that have found QT inter-
val prolongation in patients taking citalopram.14-16 
 
One cross sectional study,15  which included 38 397 
patients aged 18 and over with an electrocardiogram 
recorded after prescription of antidepressant or meth-
adone, found that QT prolongation was associated 
with dose for citalopram, escitalopram, and amitripty-
line but not for other antidepressants examined. A 
study of psychiatric inpatients aged 18 and over found 
that most people with QT prolongation had two or 
more risk factors for QT prolongation, such as hypoka-
laemia, HIV infection, abnormal T wave morphology, 
and alcohol or drug use disorders, and that citalopram 
(including escitalopram) was significantly associated 
with QT prolongation after adjustment for these fac-
tors.16  This lack of coherence may reflect the smaller 
numbers of arrhythmia outcomes in the cohort studies 
when split by antidepressant drug and dose. Thus, 
power to detect an increased risk among higher anti-
depressant dose categories is low in comparison with 
studies that measure QT interval in adults receiving 
different doses of antidepressants and treat it as a con-
tinuous outcome variable in the analyses.14 15 Torsades 
de pointes, which is the type of arrhythmia most 
closely related to QT interval prolongation, is 
extremely rare, so cohort studies (including ours) can-
not rule out an association for this particular type of 
arrhythmia. Furthermore, a surrogate measure such as 
QT interval may not necessarily translate into an effect 
on a clinically important outcome such as arrhythmia. 
Our findings of an increased risk of arrhythmia in the 
first four weeks of starting a tricyclic antidepressant is 
consistent with several potential arrhythmias that can 
occur with tricyclic overdose in people with previously 
unsuspected cardiac abnormalities such as bundle 
branch block37 38; our findings are important, as few 
studies have examined this for prescribed doses of tri-
cyclic antidepressants.
In our previous study of antidepressants in people 
aged 65 and over with depression,10 25  we found a sig-
nificantly increased risk of myocardial infarction with 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors but not with 
tricyclic or other antidepressants. Other observational 
studies have found similar results for selective sero-
tonin reuptake inhibitors,39 40  whereas several have 
found no association11 12 41 42  or a reduced risk13 43 44; 
few studies have assessed risks for individual antide-
pressants. A meta-analysis of 16 observational studies 
concluded that use of neither selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors nor tricyclic antidepressants is 
associated with an increased risk of coronary heart 
disease,45  but only two studies were restricted to 
patients with depression. These contradictory findings 
are likely to be due to differences between studies, as 
they vary considerably in their sizes and inclusion cri-
teria. Several studies either did not restrict their study 
sample to patients with depression or did not account 
for depression in the analysis and so are highly sus-
ceptible to indication bias because depression is a 
strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease11-13 ; some 
studies are only in older or postmenopausal popula-
tions10 39 42 ; and one was an interview based case-con-
trol study prone to recall bias.44  Why our results differ 
from those of our previous study in older people, 
which had a very similar study design, is unclear,10 
 
but it could be due to the larger number of myocardial 
infarction events (n=2350) in the older cohort or 
increased susceptibility to side effects in older people 
resulting from age related pharmacokinetic changes,46 
or the high prevalence of multimorbidity and use of 
concomitant drugs in older people may result in inter-
actions giving different patterns of risk with antide-
pressant use.
Observational studies of antidepressants and stroke 
have shown a more consistent pattern; several studies 
have found an increased risk of stroke with selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor use.10 42 47-49  A systematic 
review and meta-analysis of 13 observational studies of 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and stroke 
reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
were associated with an increased risk of all types of 
stroke (overall adjusted odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence 
interval 1.09 to 1.80) and that the risk was still signifi-
cantly increased when the analysis was restricted to the 
studies in which potential confounding by depression 
was considered.9  In a subgroup analysis by age group, 
the combined odds ratio for all types of stroke associ-
ated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use was 
significant only in the four studies restricted to people 
aged at least 50 years (overall adjusted odds ratio 1.58, 
1.06 to 2.36),10 
42 
50 
51  and no significantly increased risk 
was seen in studies with no age restriction (overall 
adjusted odds ratio 1.13, 0.91 to 1.39). This concurs with 
our findings in this study of no association between 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and stroke in 
people aged 20 to 64 and of an increased risk in our pre-
vious study in people aged 65 and over.10
Clinical implications and future research
Prescription of antidepressants is a complex process, 
involving balancing of risks and benefits for different 
antidepressants and doses, accounting for severity of 
depression, and considering patients’ risk factors, 
comorbidities, and preferences. The results of this study 
in adults aged 20 to 64 are reassuring in light of recent 
concerns about citalopram and potential risk of 
arrhythmia; however, as only small numbers of patients 
were treated with high doses of citalopram, we cannot 
rule out the possibility of an increased risk. We suggest 
that high doses of citalopram should not be prescribed 
without a strong indication, particularly in patients 
with any risk factors for an increased QT interval. We 
also found no evidence that selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors are associated with an increased 
risk of myocardial infarction or stroke/transient isch-
aemic attack in this age group; they may even be asso-
ciated with a reduced risk of myocardial infarction and 
arrhythmia, particularly for fluoxetine. The potential 
cardioprotective effects of selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors, particularly fluoxetine, warrant further 
investigation.

The risk of arrhythmia was increased during the first 
28 days of taking tricyclic and related antidepressants, 
and among the antidepressants studied lofepramine 
had the highest risks of arrhythmia, myocardial infarc-
tion, and stroke/transient ischaemic attack. This find-
ing may reflect selective prescribing of lofepramine, as 
it is generally considered to be safer than other tricyclic 
and related antidepressants in overdose, but could also 
indicate increased risks when it is taken at doses typi-
cally prescribed in primary care. Further research using 
other designs such as the self controlled case series 
approach may help to elucidate this association.
Conclusions
This large observational study has found no evidence 
that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are associ-
ated with an increased risk of arrhythmia, myocardial 
infarction, or stroke/transient ischaemic attack in peo-
ple with depression aged 20 to 64, but some indication 
that they are associated with a reduced risk of myocar-
dial infarction and arrhythmia, particularly for fluoxe-
tine. Citalopram was not significantly associated with 
an increased risk of arrhythmia, even at higher doses, 
although the confidence interval was wide. These find-
ings are reassuring in light of recent safety concerns 
about selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
