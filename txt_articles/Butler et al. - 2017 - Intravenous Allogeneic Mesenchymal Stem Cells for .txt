espite available therapies, patients with heart failure 
(HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) continue 
to experience high rates of mortality and hospitalization.1 
Accordingly, there has been increasing focus on alternative 
treatment strategies, including stem cell therapy.2,3 Despite in-
termittent positive signals in phase I and phase II trials, major 
reviews of available stem cell data have failed to show a de-
finitive benefit in HF.4 However, virtually all published studies 
were centered on the concept that therapeutic efficacy depends

Rationale: Potential benefits of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in heart failure may be related to paracrine 
properties and systemic effects, including anti-inflammatory activities. If this hypothesis is valid, intravenous 
administration of MSCs should improve outcomes in heart failure, an entity in which excessive chronic 
inflammation may play a pivotal role.
Objective: To assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of intravenously administered ischemia-tolerant MSCs 
(itMSCs) in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
Methods and Results: This was a single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, randomized phase II-a trial of 
nonischemic cardiomyopathy patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤40% and absent hyperenhancement 
on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were randomized to intravenously administered itMSCs (1.5×106 
cells/kg) or placebo; at 90 days, each group received the alternative treatment. Overall, 22 patients were randomized 
to itMSC (n=10) and placebo (n=12) at baseline. After crossover, data were available for 22 itMSC patients. 
No major differences in death, hospitalization, or serious adverse events were noted between the 2 treatments. 
Change from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction and ventricular volumes was not significantly different 
between therapies. Compared with placebo, itMSC therapy increased 6-minute walk distance (+36.47 m, 95% 
confidence interval 5.98–66.97; P=0.02) and improved Kansas City Cardiomyopathy clinical summary (+5.22, 
95% confidence interval 0.70–9.74; P=0.02) and functional status scores (+5.65, 95% confidence interval −0.11 
to 11.41; P=0.06). The data demonstrated MSC-induced immunomodulatory effects, the magnitude of which 
correlated with improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction.
Conclusions: In this pilot study of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, itMSC therapy was safe, caused 
immunomodulatory effects, and was associated with improvements in health status and functional capacity.

on injected stem cells engrafting in the myocardium and either 
transdifferentiating into healthy cardiac myocytes or stimu-
lating resident cardiac stem cells to expand and organize into 
functional myocardium.5 Because the intravenous delivery of 
stem cells results in low cardiac engraftment, existing clinical 
studies have been largely limited to the direct delivery of cells 
to the myocardium via intracoronary, transendocardial, or in-
tramyocardial methods.
Of particular relevance, recent data suggest that an ex-
cessive and continuing inflammatory response constitutes a 
primary mechanism in HFrEF progression.2 Interestingly, mes-
enchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete a broad array of molecules 
with potential therapeutic effects, including anti-inflammatory 
and immunomodulatory activities.2,6 These properties may ben-
efit cardiac function not only through local effects of cardiac-
engrafted cells, but also through systemic anti-inflammatory 
effects. The paracrine anti-inflammatory benefit from stem cell 
therapy also opens the possibility of a systemic effect via cells 
injected intravenously such that direct cardiac delivery may not 
be necessary to repair and stimulate the dysfunctional viable 
myocardium. Intravenous therapy also presents major logisti-
cal, cost, and safety advantages over direct cardiac delivery.
In addition, it has been shown that MSCs grown under 
chronic hypoxic conditions (ie, ischemia-tolerant MSC [it-
MSCs]) exhibit characteristics suggesting that they would be 
therapeutically more effective in the setting of chronic car-
diomyopathy than MSCs grown under normoxic conditions.7 
Specifically, in an in vitro study comparing MSCs grown un-
der normoxia versus those grown under hypoxic conditions, 
hypoxia-grown MSCs migrated better toward wound healing–
related cytokines and cytokines found in ischemic tissues and 
expressed higher levels of HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor 1; 
ie, the cell’s master switch transcription factor responsible for 
expressing gene products involved in the cellular response to 
hypoxia). Based on these results, we decided to administer 
MSCs grown under chronic hypoxic conditions in the present 
study.
Patients with HFrEF, especially those with an ischemic 
pathogenesis, may have areas of myocyte replaced with fi-
brosis, which is unlikely to respond to therapy.8 Moreover, 
previous HF studies with interventions like β-blockers and 
cardiac resynchronization therapy suggest that patients with 
nonischemic cardiomyopathy generally demonstrate more ro-
bust response to therapy, potentially related to the more likely 
presence of dysfunctional but viable myocardium as opposed 
to myocardial segments replaced by fibrosis.8–11 We, there-
fore, used delayed-enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance 
(CMR) imaging to define patients with nonischemic cardiomy-
opathy with absent hyperenhancement and to increase sensitiv-
ity in detecting structural and functional cardiac responses to 
treatment.12
The present study is a phase II-a randomized trial designed 
to assess the safety, as well as cardiac and systemic effects, 
of intravenously administered MSCs in patients with chronic 
nonischemic cardiomyopathy. To our knowledge, this trial 
represents the first published experience with intravenously 
administered stem cells in patients with any type of chronic

What Is Known?
• The therapeutic efficacy of stem cells is thought to depend primarily on 
local myocardial effects, necessitating efficient myocardial engraftment.
• Intravenous delivery of stem cells results in low cardiac engraftment, 
leading to a focus on catheter-based delivery of cells.
• Continuing inflammation may contribute to heart failure (HF) progression.
What New Information Does This Article Contribute?
• Intravenous administration of ischemia-tolerant mesenchymal stem 
cells (itMSCs) improved patient clinical status.
• Administration of itMSCs caused systemic anti-inflammatory effects 
(reduced number of CD4-positive and natural killer cells)
• The magnitude of itMSC-induced natural killer cell reduction was inverse-
ly associated with the magnitude of the improvement in cardiac function.
It is generally assumed that if stem cells are to be an effective 
HF therapy, they have to be delivered in large numbers to the tar-
get tissue—the heart. This requires catheter delivery of cells, an 
impractical strategy for repeated administrations. Data suggest 
that chronic inflammation contributes to progressive HF. Because 
MSCs secrete factors with multiple activities, including anti-in-
flammatory, we postulated that intravenously administered MSCs 
could improve clinical outcomes, in part, by systemic anti-inflam-
matory effects. Patients with nonischemic HF underwent intra-
venous injection of either saline or MSCs that were grown under 
chronic hypoxic conditions (itMSC). Patients treated with itMSCs 
demonstrated significant clinical improvement. Administration of 
itMSCs was associated with a reduced number of natural killer 
cells, and the magnitude of this reduction was inversely corre-
lated with improved left ventricular ejection fraction. This study 
shows that despite low myocardial engraftment, intravenously 
administered MSCs improve clinical end points, effects possi-
bly caused, in part, by systemic anti-inflammatory effects. The 
results of this investigation, if confirmed, could impact clinical 
applicability of stem cell therapeutics and could provide insights 
into novel mechanisms underlying HF progression that could lead 
to identification of new therapeutic targets.

cardiomyopathy and the first to test the hypothesis that the 
systemic effects of MSCs can lead to clinical improvements.
Methods
This study was a single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multicenter, 
randomized study with blinded end point assessment that enrolled pa-
tients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular (LV) ejec-
tion fraction (LVEF) ≤40%. The study design and rationale have been 
previously described, and the protocol is available in the Online Data 
Supplement.13 Institutional review board approval was obtained at each 
study site, and all patients provided written informed consent.
Study Patients
Full inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study are detailed in the 
trial protocol (Online Data Supplement). Briefly, eligible patients 
were ambulatory with chronic nonischemic cardiomyopathy with 
LVEF ≤40% on baseline CMR, were aged ≥18 years, and had New 
York Heart Association (NYHA) class II/III symptoms. Nonischemic 
cardiomyopathy was defined by the following: (1) no history of myo-
cardial infarction; (2) absent or nonobstructive coronary artery disease 
on invasive or computed tomography coronary angiography within 3 
years prior to randomization, and (3) no evidence of hyperenhance-
ment on screening delayed-enhancement CMR. Patients were receiv-
ing stable maximally tolerated guideline-directed medical therapy for 
HFrEF for ≥6 months prior to randomization. Because of the use of 
CMR, patients with current or planned implantation of an implantable-
cardioverter defibrillator, permanent pacemaker, or cardiac resynchro-
nization therapy devices were excluded, as where patients treated with 
inotropic agents within 1 month of randomization and patients with 
severe valvular, renal (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/
min), or liver disease (alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase 
>3× normal, alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin >2× normal).
Study Design
Patients who met eligibility criteria were blinded to treatment al-
location and randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous itMSC therapy 
or placebo. At 90 days post-initial infusion, the 2 groups received 
the alternative treatment in the crossover phase, thus, resulting in 
each patient receiving 2 infusions (ie, 1 itMSC and 1 placebo) during 
the study. For reference, the 2 groups were labeled by the order in 
which they received treatment: placebo–itMSC and itMSC–placebo. 
Additionally, the term control pertains to data from baseline to 90 
days among the placebo–itMSC group. The itMSC group refers to 
data from baseline to 90 days among the itMSC–placebo group, as 
well as data from 90 days to 180 days among the placebo–itMSC 
group. A 90-day follow-up was felt a reasonable duration to evaluate 
response to study treatment based on (1) prior experiences with ven-
tricular remodeling from existing HF therapeutics14 and (2) clinical 
practice guidelines supporting delay of primary prevention implant-
able-cardioverter defibrillator ≥90 days after initiation of guideline-
directed medical therapy to allow for potential ventricular recovery.14
The investigational therapy was an intravenous infusion of isch-
emia-tolerant human donor allogeneic MSCs dosed at 1.5 million 
cells/kg. All cells expressed CD105, CD73, and CD90 surface mark-
ers and were extracted from the bone marrow of a young healthy vol-
unteer. Cells were grown under hypoxic conditions from the moment 
of extraction. For purposes of cryopreservation, cells were suspended

in Cryostar CS10 freezing medium (BioLife Solutions, Bothell, WA), 
frozen in a freezer at a controlled rate, and stored in the vapor phase 
of liquid nitrogen. Within 8 hours prior to patient infusion, cells were 
thawed within the pharmacy of the local study site and suspended in 
Lactated Ringer’s solution at a concentration of 1×106 cells/mL. The 
placebo therapy was an intravenous infusion of Lactate Ringer’s solu-
tion at a volume of 1 mL/kg.
Study End Points
The primary safety end points were assessed at days 30, 60, 90, 
120, 150, 180, 270, and 450 post-initial infusion. At each time 
point, all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and adverse 
events (including severity of event and perceived relationship 
to the study products as related or not related) were reported by 
study investigators. Vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms, and 
laboratory tests (including complete blood counts, comprehensive 
chemistry panels, troponin I, and creatinine kinase) were collected 
at each time point. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring was done 
at all time points through 270 days post-initial infusion. An inde-
pendent data and safety monitoring board monitored patient safety 
during the trial.
Multiple secondary efficacy end points were prespecified. CMR 
testing was prespecified at baseline, day 90, and day 180 for all 
patients. CMR end points included change in LVEF, wall motion 
summary score, LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), and LV end-
diastolic volume (LVEDV) from the time of infusion to 90 days 
post-infusion between itMSC and control groups. Six-minute walk 
distance (6MWD), NYHA class, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
Questionnaire data were collected at day 30 and day 90 after initial 
and second infusions. Protocol-prespecified serum biomarkers (in-
cluding N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin I, fibro-
blast growth factor 23, and vascular endothelial growth factor) and 
lymphocyte proliferation panels (including levels of CD3, CD4, and 
natural killer [NK] cells) were assessed at these same time points.
Statistical Analysis
Because of the exploratory nature of this early-phase study, a sample 
size of 23 patients were targeted as appropriate for a phase II-a pri-
marily safety trial. Summary data are presented as mean or median as 
appropriate, and all analyses used a 2-sided 0.05 significance level. 
Comparative analyses for the primary safety end points of adverse 
and serious adverse events are presented in entirety and also by at-
tributing adverse events to either the placebo or the itMSC therapy 
for the 90-day period after the administration of either intervention.
To investigate the effects of itMSCs on efficacy end points, the 
changes in these parameters during the 2 treatment periods were 
combined. To assess changes in the placebo group, only data from 
those who received placebo first (0–90 days) were used. Those re-
ceiving placebo during the 90- to 180-day period were excluded to 
avoid any confounding from a possible carryover effect because of 
the cell therapy received during the first 90-day period. Improvement 
in NYHA classification was analyzed using logistic regression 
with treatment and group assignment (itMSC–placebo versus

placebo–itMSC) as covariates. All other continuous secondary effi-
cacy end points related to change from baseline were analyzed using 
linear regression (with treatment, randomization group assignment, 
and the baseline value as covariates) to determine estimated mean, 
the differences compared with placebo, and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CI). Given that the data from patients assigned to the placebo–
itMSC group were used in both the itMSC group and the control 
group, correlations within the same patient were accounted for using 
generalized estimating equation in all models. As exploratory analy-
ses, we also compared these end points in subjects during the initial 
randomization (0–90 days) period between itMSC and placebo using 
the same models but adjusted only for baseline values for continuous 
variables and Fisher exact test for NYHA classification. Available 
case analysis was used to handle missing data.15 Data were analyzed 
using SAS version 9.3.
Results
Of the 34 patients screened, 23 were randomized and 22 re-
ceived the study intervention (Figure 1). Patients were ran-
domized from 4 sites across the United States between June 
2014 and April 2016. Overall, 12 patients randomized to pla-
cebo–itMSC completed the treatment in 90 days and, thus, 
constituted the control treatment. Those receiving placebo 
after receiving itMSCs were not included in the control treat-
ment because there may have been carryover effects from the 
initial cell therapy period. The itMSC-treated group included 
10 itMSC–placebo patients who completed study treatment 
in 90 days plus 12 placebo–itMSC patients who completed 
study treatment in 180 days. Thus, the itMSC-treated group 
included 22 patients who completed treatment in 90 days after 
itMSC infusion.
Baseline characteristics of the population are presented 
in Table 1. Mean age was 47.3 years, and over two thirds of 
the patients were white. All but 1 patient had NYHA class II 
symptoms, and median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic pep-
tide was 212 pg/mL. Rates of comorbidities were generally 
low, with <25% of patients having hypertension, diabetes mel-
litus, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. At baseline, 
patients were receiving loop diuretics (72.7%), angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers 
(100.0%), β-blockers (100.0%), and mineralocorticoid recep-
tor antagonists (81.8%).
Safety
Safety data are displayed in Table 2, and the values reflect 
events that occurred in the 90 days after placebo or itMSC 
infusion. During these 90-day periods, no patients experi-
enced death, hospitalization, or serious adverse events. Rates 
of adverse events were generally balanced between the 2 
treatments at 90 days. There was 1 cell-related adverse event 
related to bruising at the intravenous infusion site. Over the 
course of the study, there were no deaths, and there was a total 
of 1 hospitalization (which was for atrial fibrillation that oc-
curred within the itMSC–placebo group 1 year after placebo 
infusion). Holter monitoring showed clinically significant ab-
normalities in 1 patient over the course of the study. This pa-
tient, randomized to the placebo–itMSC group, had an event 
defined as other on day 60 and an episode of ventricular tachy-
cardia on day 120. Online Table I displays safety data for the 
90 days after original treatment (ie, precrossover period only).
Cardiac Remodeling
There were no significant differences between itMSC and 
placebo treatment periods in any 90-day CMR end point, in-
cluding LV wall motion summary score, LVEF, LVEDV, and 
LVESV (all P≥0.5; Table 3). In ad hoc exploratory analyses 
that examined changes from baseline after initial randomiza-
tion (ie, first 90 days, precrossover), there were significant re-
ductions in LVEDV (estimated mean difference −17.86 mL; 
P=0.04) and LVESV (estimated mean difference −16.60 mL; 
P=0.02) and increases in LVEF (estimated mean difference 
+2.31; P=0.02) within the itMSC group. During this same 
time period, changes in those patients who were receiving 
placebo were not significant (LVEDV, estimated mean differ-
ence −10.56 mL, P=0.22; LVESV, estimated mean difference 
−8.90 mL, P=0.27; LVEF, estimated mean difference +1.62, 
P=0.13). However, the differences in these parameters be-
tween the 2 treatments during this period were not significant.
Health Status and Functional Capacity
Treatment with itMSCs resulted in statistically significant im-
provements in health status and functional capacity end points 
(Table 3). When the change from baseline to 90 days was com-
pared after itMSC therapy with the change during the control 
period, 6MWD was significantly greater by 36.47 m (95% 
CI 5.98–66.97; P=0.02) or 15.9% (Figure 2A). Specifically,

within the itMSC group, 6MWD increased by an average of 
27.40 m (95% CI 0.28–54.52; P=0.05), but it decreased by an 
average of 10.83 m (95% CI −38.66 to 17.00, P=0.45) among 
control patients.
Compared with the change from baseline during the con-
trol period, itMSC therapy resulted in greater improvements 
in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical sum-
mary (+5.22, 95% CI 0.70–9.74; P=0.02) and functional sta-
tus scores (+5.65, 95% CI −0.11 to 11.41; P=0.06; Figure 2B 
and 2C). In addition, compared with the change from base-
line during the control period, itMSC therapy was associated 
with a nonsignificant greater odds (odds ratio 3.67, 95% CI 
0.27–50.03; P=0.33) of lower NYHA classification at 90 days. 
Specifically, 90 days after itMSC therapy, NYHA classifica-
tion was significantly improved compared with that at baseline 
(P≤0.01), whereas there was no significant change within the 
control group (only 1 out of 12 patients had improvement). In

post-infusion, including an increase in the percentage of CD3 
(P=0.045) and CD4 cells (P=0.006) and a decrease in absolute and 
percent NK cells (P=0.025 and P=0.006, respectively; Table 4). 
Changes from baseline in other biomarkers, including N-terminal 
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin I, during the itMSC 
phase were nonsignificant at 30 and 90 days post-infusion.
In ad hoc analysis, there was an inverse relationship be-
tween the degree of reduction in NK cells from baseline to 90 
days and the magnitude of improvement in LVEF (R2=0.31, 
P=0.01; Figure 3) but not with LVEDV (R2=0.06, P=0.29) or 
LVESV (R2=0.12, P=0.14).
Discussion
This phase II-a trial was designed to evaluate the safety and 
preliminary efficacy of intravenous administration of itM-
SCs in a relatively homogenous population of patients with 
nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Overall, this study found a 
single dose of intravenous itMSCs to be safe, to be well-tol-
erated, and to provide clinically relevant signals for efficacy.
itMSC therapy resulted in improvements in patient health 
status. Although study sample size was small, concordance in 
improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire 
scores and 6MWD decreases the likelihood of a chance finding. 
Both of these metrics are routinely used in the early- and late-
phase HFrEF trials, and baseline values have typically shown 
good correlation with survival and quality of life.16–18 6MWD, in 
particular, is strongly associated with peak exercise oxygen con-
sumption, which is among the most powerful and objective pre-
dictors of functional status and short-term event-free survival.16
Most prior stem cell studies have been designed under the 
assumption that the mechanism of benefit of stem cell therapy 
accrues only from activities derived from cells engrafted in 
the dysfunctional myocardium, whether these activities reflect 
cells differentiating into cardiac myocytes, stimulating resident 
cardiac stem cells to expand and form more functioning myo-
cytes, or reflect broad paracrine and systemic activities that al-
low, for example, favorable cardiac remodeling, enhancement 
of angiogenesis, and decreased apoptosis.2,5 Thus, studies have 
focused on delivery methods that maximize myocardial en-
graftment, including intracoronary, transendocardial, or intra-
myocardial routes. However, such strategies involve catheter 
or surgical techniques and suffer major practical limitations, in 
that a single injection of cells is unlikely to be curative and that 
multiple invasive cell administrations would likely be required 
over the course of the condition.
Because intravenous cell delivery results in low rates of 
cardiac engraftment, to our knowledge, there has been only 
a single clinical trial assessing the efficacy of intravenous 
administration, with that study limited to patients with acute 
myocardial infarction.19 Interestingly, that study still oper-
ated under the belief that MSCs need robust engraftment in 
ischemic myocardium to show benefit, and no data on po-
tential systemic immunomodulatory effects of cell therapy 
were obtained.
In the present study, clinical improvements with intravenous 
delivery of itMSCs were associated with statistically significant 
alterations in the numbers of several circulating inflammatory 
cells, suggesting that intravenous delivery of MSCs does convey 
systemic signals, in particular, a modulatory effect on the inflam-
matory system. Importantly, we found a statistically significant 
inverse relationship between change in NK cell number and 
LVEF, whereby the degree of NK cell reduction correlated with 
the magnitude of improvement in LVEF at 90 days (Figure 3).
Two preclinical studies in murine models of acute myocar-
dial infarction and ischemic cardiomyopathy in the laboratory 
of 2 authors (S.E.E. and M.J.L., manuscripts submitted and in 
review) support the concept that an MSC-induced decrease 
in the NK cell population mechanistically contributes to the 
therapeutic effect of itMSCs. The studies demonstrated that 
intravenous injection of the same human itMSCs used in this

trial significantly improves LV function and adverse remodel-
ing, and most importantly, that a major mechanism responsible 
for these beneficial effects is through their immunomodulatory 
effects. Notably, it was demonstrated in the acute myocardial 
infarction model that the MSC-induced decrease in NK cells 
was causally related to the beneficial LV functional outcomes 
seen with MSC administration. In aggregate with the current 
study results, these data support the importance of immuno-
modulatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of itMSCs and 
suggest that suppression of NK cells in nonischemic HFrEF 
facilitates ventricular recovery, thereby, supporting NK cells as 
a potential target for therapy.2 Moreover, in the present study, 
the finding of an itMSC-induced 30-day reduction in NK cell 
number that attenuated with time from itMSC infusion sup-
ports further study of serial repeated administrations of MSCs 
to examine the hypothesis that sustained reductions in NK cells 
further enhance potential favorable cardiac effects.
It is unclear why itMSC therapy resulted in significant 
improvements in health status and functional capacity pa-
rameters compared with placebo without an effect on cardiac 
function or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. It is 
plausible that this discordance could be explained by noncar-
diac systemic effects of itMSC therapy, perhaps mediated via 
anti-inflammatory properties. One could speculate that such 
systemic effects could influence processes such as skeletal 
muscle performance and oxygen delivery, thereby, improving 
functional status independent of the heart. Importantly, how-
ever, this study was not powered to definitively evaluate car-
diac-specific effects of itMSC. In this regard, it is of interest 
that significant improvements in LVEDV (P=0.04), LVESV 
(P=0.05), and LVEF (P=0.02) by CMR occurred over the 
first 3 months of the trial (ie, precrossover) within the itMSC 
group, but not in the control group. Because these findings 
were identified as part of an ad hoc analysis, they must be 
considered exploratory only. Future studies will be necessary 
to conclusively determine whether intravenous administration 
of itMSCs enhances cardiac function in HF patients.
Novel features of the present study design deserve men-
tion. The wide heterogeneity of the HFrEF population has 
been increasingly recognized as a challenge in successful 
therapy development.20 HFrEF is a clinical syndrome and not 
a specific disease, representing various combinations of car-
diac and noncardiac abnormalities. Accordingly, it has been 
postulated that different subgroups may respond differently to 
various investigational therapies and, thus, dilute efficacy sig-
nals within a given clinical trial.21,22 The present study aimed 
to isolate a specific homogenous patient subset using a rigor-
ous definition of nonischemic cardiomyopathy through a com-
bination of clinical, angiographic, and CMR parameters. The 
goal of such criteria was to maximize presence of dysfunc-
tional viable myocardium and, thus, the chances of reverse 
remodeling.8,11 To our knowledge, no prior HF study has so 
specifically defined its patient population, and this trial may 
represent a model for future early-phase HF trials.
Limitations of the present study must be acknowledged. 
The sample size for this study was small and, thus, precludes 
definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of itMSCs in this 
population. However, such a sample size is typical of an early-
phase study with the primary goal of assessing safety. Like all 
ad hoc analyses, the analysis correlating NK cell reduction 
with change in LVEF was exploratory and requires prospec-
tive validation. Moreover, inherent to a crossover study de-
sign, we cannot definitively determine if any adverse event 
occurring >90 days after itMSC infusion within the itMSC–
placebo group represents placebo effect, delayed consequence 
of cell therapy, or random chance. Finally, this study used 
MSCs grown under chronic hypoxia because prior in vitro 
studies demonstrated that such cells have greater activity to-
ward tissue healing than cells grown under normoxic condi-
tions. Although there were signals of efficacy in this study, 
the trial was not designed to test whether the administration of 
MSCs grown under chronic hypoxia versus those grown under 
normoxic conditions accounted for these positive signals.
In conclusion, intravenous administration of itMSCs in pa-
tients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy with reduced LVEF 
was safe and well-tolerated. At 90 days post-infusion, compared 
with control, a single dose of study therapy consistently im-
proved multiple measurements of patient health status, but was 
not associated with significant cardiac structural or functional 
improvements on CMR compared with placebo. Ad hoc explor-
atory analysis of data limited to changes from baseline after ini-
tial study therapy found significant reductions in LVEDV and 
LVESV and increases in LVEF within the itMSC group. These 
changes were not observed in those patients who were receiving 
placebo. Moreover, of mechanistic relevance, intravenously ad-
ministered itMSCs caused systemic immunomodulatory effects 
that correlated with improvement in LVEF. Further studies are

needed to explore the efficacy of serial dosing of intravenously 
administered itMSCs to produce more sustained immunomodu-
latory effects and, thereby, perhaps facilitate improvement in 
LV structure and function and clinical outcomes.
