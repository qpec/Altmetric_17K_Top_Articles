We introduce a paradigm of completely non-invasive, on-demand diagnostics that may
replace common blood-based laboratory tests using only a smartphone app and photos. We
initially targeted anemia, a blood condition characterized by low blood hemoglobin levels that
afflicts >2 billion people. Our app estimates hemoglobin levels by analyzing color and
metadata of fingernail bed smartphone photos and detects anemia (hemoglobin levels <12.5
g dL−1) with an accuracy of ±2.4 g dL−1 and a sensitivity of 97% (95% CI, 89–100%) when
compared with CBC hemoglobin levels (n = 100 subjects), indicating its viability to serve as a
non-invasive anemia screening tool. Moreover, with personalized calibration, this system
achieves an accuracy of ±0.92 g dL−1 of CBC hemoglobin levels (n = 16), empowering chronic
anemia patients to serially monitor their hemoglobin levels instantaneously and remotely.
Our on-demand system enables anyone with a smartphone to download an app and
immediately detect anemia anywhere and anytime.

lthough smartphone-based telehealth has the potential to
change how healthcare is delivered by enabling remote
diagnosis1, these technologies have yet to non-invasively
replace blood-based testing, which remains a major cornerstone
of disease diagnosis in modern medicine2–4. Indeed, while
custom-designed smartphone attachments may allow for blood-
based, point-of-care diagnosis and analysis5, the burden of blood
sampling combined with the additional cost and need for
equipment external to the smartphone prevents broader adoption
of these potentially disruptive technologies.
Due to its high prevalence affecting over 2 billion people
globally, anemia, characterized by low blood hemoglobin (Hgb)
levels6, was chosen as the initial disease target for us to study.
Anemia has numerous causes, ranging from common nutritional
causes, such as iron or folate deficiency, which are relatively
straightforward to treat and cure, to rarer genetic causes, such as
sickle cell disease or thalassemia major, which lead to severe and
chronic anemia that requires frequent monitoring. Detection of
anemia involves either anemia screening or anemia diagnosis, and
both require different degrees of measurement accuracy. First, a
clear clinical need exists for easily and widely accessible tools to
screen for anemia among at-risk populations (e.g., pregnant
women, toddler-age children, elderly patients) or the general
public to determine whether an individual will need formal
confirmatory testing with the gold standard Hgb level test
obtained via a complete blood count (CBC). However, there is
also a need to for non-invasive methods to more quantitatively
and officially diagnose and monitor anemia with higher precision
Hgb levels, especially patients with known or chronic anemia.
Existing clinical approaches to measure blood Hgb levels
require specialized equipment and represent tradeoffs between
invasiveness, accuracy, infrastructure requirements, and cost7–9,
all of which are especially problematic in rural and low-resource
settings, where anemia is most prevalent. For example, the gold
standard CBC Hgb level measurement requires: blood sampling
by a trained phlebotomist, a clinical hematology analyzer with the
required electrical power, biochemical reagents, and infra-
structure thereof, along with a trained laboratory technician to
perform the analysis10. Aside from being cost-prohibitive in
resource-poor settings, the necessary invasive blood sampling to
measure Hgb levels causes discomfort in younger pediatric
patients11. Interestingly, several reports have suggested that
anemia may qualitatively correlate with subjective assessments of
pallor in various anatomic regions of the patient’s body12–17,
namely the fingernail beds, conjunctiva, and palmar creases.
Here, we leverage this observation that pallor is associated with
anemia to develop a method that quantitatively analyzes pallor in
patient-sourced photos using image analysis algorithms to enable
a noninvasive, accurate quantitative smartphone app for detecting
anemia (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). At the same time, we
implemented quality control software to minimize the impact of
common fingernail irregularities (e.g., leukonychia and camera
flash reflection) on Hgb level measurement (Fig. 1b). To validate
our method, we conducted a clinical assessment
of this
smartphone-based technology using blood samples and smart-
phone fingernail images of patients with anemia of different
etiologies as well as healthy subjects. With this technology, a user
downloads an app onto their smartphone, takes a photo of his/her
fingernail beds, and instantaneously receives an accurate Hgb
level which is displayed directly onto the smartphone screen by
the app. Since fingernails, conjunctiva, and palmar creases do not
contain melanocytes (melanin producing skin cells), the primary
source of color of these anatomical features is blood Hgb18. Of
these sites, fingernails are straightforward for a user to self-image,
unlike conjunctiva, and also have low person-to-person size and
shape variability, unlike palmar creases. Our approach represents
a substantial conceptual advance over all other published POC
anemia detection tools, since these techniques require external
equipment, such as calibration cards, background light blocking
devices, smartphone attachments, or expensive spectrometry
readers19,20. Here we have developed a fully functional and
standalone smartphone app that enables the non-invasive mea-
surement of blood Hgb levels and has several advantages over
existing approaches as highlighted in Table 1. Our app technology
leverages the image metadata, a vast trove of information that has
been completely ignored by every published study to date that
uses smartphones for diagnostics. By mining this rich source of
information as well as the color data with a robust multi-linear
regression approach, we demonstrate a system in which accurate
Hgb measurements are obtained with a smartphone without the
need for any external equipment. Indeed, while smartphone
images automatically record metadata, instead of examining these
data, other groups have used physical strategies such as color
calibration cards and light blocking enclosures20,21. By eliminat-
ing external equipment, this system enables on-demand Hgb level
measurement as it requires only the user’s smartphone and can be
conducted in under 1 min. Therefore, users who desire to screen
themselves for anemia can do so immediately by just down-
loading an app without being required to wait for external
equipment to be shipped to their homes, something other
smartphone anemia tools require. Furthermore, this smartphone-
based technique will empower patients to take control of their
clinical care via self-testing of Hgb levels.
Results
Anemia screening using the smartphone app. This system has
the capacity to serve as a noninvasive anemia self-screening tool
for use by the general population or at risk populations. With a
single smartphone image and no personalized calibration step,
smartphone Hgb levels were measured to within ± 2.4 g dL−1
with a bias of 0.2 g dL−1 of CBC Hgb levels in 100 patients with a
variety of anemia diagnoses mixed with healthy subjects (Fig. 2a,
r = 0.82; Fig. 3, Table 2), defined as the 95% limits of agreement
(LoA). This noninvasive approach represents a greater degree of
accuracy than reported accuracy levels of existing invasive POC
anemia screening methods7,22,23. Moreover, receiver-operating
characteristic analysis revealed that this test achieves a strong
diagnostic performance with an area under the curve of 0.88
(Fig. 2b) and highlights the accuracy of this technology
throughout the entire range of tested Hgb levels. Additionally,
there was minimal correlation between patient Hgb levels and
smartphone-measured residual (r = 0.26), indicating that the
algorithm performance remained consistent throughout range of
tested Hgb levels (Fig. 2c). Notably, when using a cutoff of < 11.0
g dL−1 to define anemia, a well-established Hgb level threshold
(Fig. 2b, Supplementary Figure 1)12, the sensitivity and specificity
of the system to detect anemia was 92% (95% CI, 80–97%) and
76% (95% CI, 62–87%), respectively. Using the average WHO
Hgb level cutoff for anemia of 12.5 g dL−1 in men and women,
the sensitivity of the test improves to 97% (95% CI, 89–100%),
indicating the potential for this test to serve as a noninvasive
screening tool for anemia (Supplementary Figure 2)24. In fact,
this degree of accuracy is on par with reported accuracy values in
POC settings of the invasive clinically used Hemocue and sub-
stantially better than under-development POC screening tools

 eliminate some of the measurement error introduced by subject-
to-subject variability and therefore further improve the accuracy.
Thus, we conducted a study in which the smartphone-based
algorithm was calibrated for each subject (4 subjects total) over
the course of 4 weeks and achieved personalized, accurate Hgb
level measurements, enabling long-term serial monitoring of Hgb
levels (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Figure 3). Overall, when used in
this manner, this system achieved a level of accuracy of ±0.92 g dL
−1 with a bias of 0.09 g dL−1 compared to CBC Hgb levels
(Supplementary Figure 4), again, defined by the 95% LOA (i.e.,
the Hgb level difference from the gold standard that 95% of
smartphone measurements will fall between), representing an
improvement on the reported accuracy of current invasive, point-
of-care hemoglobin tests, such as Hemocue9, and clinically used

Fig. 1 Implementation of a smartphone app for measuring hemoglobin (Hgb). a A patient simply downloads the app onto their smartphone, opens the app,
obtains a smartphone photo of his/her fingernail beds, and without the need for any blood sampling or additional smartphone attachments or external
calibration tools, quantitatively measures blood Hgb levels. The patient first takes an image of their fingernails, and is then prompted by the app to tap on
the screen to select the regions of interest corresponding to the nailbeds, and a result is then displayed on the smartphone screen. Images are screenshots
and photos of actual operation of this app. b As smartphone images with fingernail irregularities such as camera flash reflections or leukonychia may affect
Hgb level measurements, a quality control algorithm integrated within the Hgb level measurement app detects and omits those irregularities to preserve
measurement integrity and accuracy. To that end, the user selects regions of interest from within the fingernail image, and any color values that fall outside
of expected color ranges are excluded from Hgb measurement. In this example, when the quality control system was implemented to exclude the fingernail
bed irregularities, Hgb level was measured to be 14.7 g dL−1, comparable to the patient’s CBC Hgb level of 15.3 g dL−1. Without the quality control
algorithm, Hgb level was measured at 12.8 g dL−1, indicating that the algorithm resulted in a 76% reduction in error. Note that as the smartphone image-
based algorithm is device-agnostic, the analysis of the smartphone images, and therefore the Hgb level measurements, could also be transmitted to
another device (e.g., laptop, cloud-based server) for remote rather than on-board analysis

 noninvasive methods such as the Masimo Radical 726. The
standard deviation used to calculate the 95% LOA in this case was
determined via a random effects model27, which takes intra-
patient variance caused by repeated Hgb measurements of each
patient into account. This indicates that Hgb level measurement
error is consistently low across our small, yet diverse study
sample size (two subjects suffering from chronic anemia, one
healthy male subject, and one health female subject). Addition-
ally, the smartphone Hgb level measurement residual did not
correlate with the average between each patient’s CBC Hgb level
and smartphone Hgb level with (r = −0.24), indicating that
residuals were not biased for any specific range of Hgb levels (i.e.,
algorithm performance remained fairly constant throughout the
entire physiologic range of tested Hgb levels) (Fig. 4b). Further-
more, this degree of accuracy falls below a clinically significant
threshold for Hgb level measurement of ±1 g dL−1 (95% LOA)
22,28,29, suggesting that this system can potentially be considered
interchangeable with the CBC Hgb level given further study and
an increased sample size30. Furthermore, 93% of measurements
fall within Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)
allowable total error of ±7% (difference from CBC)31, indicating
that, upon further refinement and completion of additional
testing, this technology may potentially be viable for at-home and
clinical use for diagnosis of anemia in addition to the screening
capability of the app when uncalibrated.
Smartphone anemia app is agnostic to sources of interference.
Use of fingernail beds as the imaging area is ideal due to the fact
that fingernail beds contain minimal amounts of melanin com-
pared to other parts of the skin32,33, theoretically rendering this
technique insensitive to subject skin tone. To address this
experimentally, images were converted into the CIELab color
space, a commonly used color quantification system that quan-
tifies color as perceived by the human eye34. In particular, the L*
value in this color space has been shown to serve as a linear
indicator of skin tone34. The relationship between the subjects’
skin tones and Hgb measurement residuals was determined by
measuring the L* value of a patch of skin adjacent to the fin-
gernail. L* did not correlate (r = 0.13) with Hgb measurement
residual, indicating that subject skin tone has little impact on the
ability of the smartphone system to measure Hgb levels (Fig. 5a).
For accessibility in dynamic clinical settings, the smartphone
app must function under a wide variety of background lighting
conditions. To that end, using luminous flux readings on a digital
light meter, no correlation (r = 0.00) was found between room
brightness and Hgb measurement residual, indicating that this

Fig. 2 The smartphone-based image analysis algorithm accurately measures Hgb levels. a The smartphone image analysis algorithm measures blood Hgb
levels to within ±0.97 g dL−1 of the CBC Hgb level (r = 0.82, mean |error|). The solid line represents the ideal result where smartphone Hgb level is equal to
the CBC Hgb level whereas the dashed line represents the actual data fit. Inset images illustrate example patient-sourced photos that were used to
calculate Hgb level measurements. b The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis graphically illustrates the algorithm’s diagnostic performance
against a random chance diagnosis (red line), with an area under the curve of 0.5, and a perfect diagnostic (green lines), with an area under the curve of 1.
In the case of this noninvasive smartphone app Hgb measurement system (black line), the area under the curve of 0.88 suggests viable diagnostic
performance of this algorithm. When using the WHO Hgb level cutoff of < 12.5 g dL−1, the sensitivity of the test is 97% (95% CI, 89–100%), n = 100
patients. c Bland–Altman analysis reveals minimal experimental bias with 0.2 g dL−1 average error, indicating that Hgb measurement is has a very small
bias. The dashed line represents the relationship between the residual and the average of Hgb level measurements obtained from the CBC and the
algorithm (r = 0.26). The solid red lines represent 95% limits of agreement (±2.4 g dL−1). n = 100

 method can be used in a wide variety of settings and lighting
conditions (Fig. 5b). Use of the camera flash resulted in the most
accurate Hgb level measurement, likely due to the normalization
of background lighting conditions provided by the camera flash
(Supplementary
Figure
5).
Furthermore,
ensuring
that
the
technology is agnostic to the smartphone make and model, RGB
pixel intensity values of the subject’s fingernail beds and a control
patch of skin were found to be similar between images taken with
smartphones made from different manufacturers and models
(Supplementary Figure 6A). Additionally, no statistically signifi-
cant difference existed between pixel intensity values of fingernail
bed images obtained by two different smartphone (Supplementary
Figure 6B). Finally, the precision of Hgb level measurements using
our technology was found to be ±0.17 g dL−1 (± refers to standard
deviation of n = 3 phones) when tested on multiple images of the
same individual’s fingernails. Furthermore, preliminary studies
suggest that hand temperature and exercise status do not impact
Hgb level measurement, indicating that the app may be agnostic to
fingernail perfusion variability (Supplementary Table 1).
App outperforms physician Hgb measurement via physical
exam. Clinical hematologists, US Board certified physicians who
specialize in the clinical care of patient with blood disorders, were
asked to measure Hgb levels in patients via inspection of images
of fingernails. In order to account for physician bias associated
with physical examination of patients (e.g., prior knowledge of
the patient’s medical history), the physicians reviewed the same
images of the patients’ fingernails as the app. This approach better
compares the diagnostic capabilities of physicians and the app.
When estimating Hgb levels based on examinations of images of
patient fingernail beds (n = 50), hematologists estimated blood
Hgb levels to within ±4.6 g dL−1 of the CBC Hgb level (95% LOA,
Fig. 6a). Note that this degree of accuracy represents nearly the
entire physiologic Hgb level range tested. The app was then tested
on the dataset of 50 patient images and measured Hgb to within
±1.0 g dL−1 of CBC Hgb levels (95% LOA, Fig. 6b). Furthermore,
ROC analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.94 for the app
vs
0.63
for
the
hematologists,
representing
a
significant
improvement in diagnostic accuracy (Fig. 6c, d). Moreover,
agreement of Hgb levels between the physicians’ estimates, the
smartphone app, and CBC Hgb levels was assessed using the
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which found that the
smartphone app and CBC Hgb levels demonstrate excellent
agreement (defined as ICC < 0.9) as ICC is estimated to be 0.95
(95% confidence interval (CI): 0.92–0.97), while an average of the
five hematologists’ evaluations demonstrated only moderate
agreement with the CBC Hgb levels, with an ICC of 0.59
(0.37–0.74). Importantly, inter-physician variability of Hgb level
estimates were high, as indicated by the low level of agreement
with an ICC of 0.20 (95% CI .07–0.36).
Discussion
Given the performance of this technology and high prevalence of
anemia worldwide, afflicting nearly two billion people, especially
young children, the elderly, and pregnant women, worldwide, this
completely noninvasive technology that requires only photos
obtained from smartphones has significant implications as a
widely accessible screening tool for at risk populations and the
general population. The ability to inexpensively diagnose anemia
with a high sensitivity, completely noninvasively and without the
need for any external smartphone attachments or calibration
equipment represents a significant improvement over current
POC anemia screening. The external equipment requirements of
current existing POC anemia screening technologies represent a
significant hurdle for use, as each additional piece of equipment
requires a supply chain to support it. For example, even relatively
low-cost color calibration cards used to normalize for different
background lighting require distribution to the patient and quality
control measures regarding the manufacturing process to ensure
that the colors are printed precisely and accurately on each card.
In addition, while our system can be used for both anemia
screening and diagnosis, it is important to contextualize the

 accuracy requirements of these different clinical scenarios.
Though clinical diagnostic tools for anemia have strict accuracy
requirements (95% LOA of ± 1.0 g dL−1), these requirements are
less stringent in POC settings, where anemia screening, rather
than diagnosis is crucial. Our results indicate that this smart-
phone app is ideally suited for screening anemia. Indeed, the
accuracy we have presented (95% LOA of ±2.4 g dL−1) is com-
parable or better than currently available POC diagnostic tools
such as the invasive Hemocue (95% LOA of ± 2.3 g dL−1), the
expensive Masimo (95% LOA of ± 3.7 g dL−1), and the invasive
WHO Color Scale (95% LOA of ± 3.3 g dL−1)19,25,35. Further-
more, the results of the app when individually calibrated suggest
that this technology may, with further study, achieve Hgb mea-
surement accuracy necessary for anemia diagnosis. Going for-
ward, we will continue to increase enrollment in our individual
calibration studies to confirm the high level of diagnostic accu-
racy that would be necessary to truly replace blood-based anemia
testing. We present specific use cases highlighting the difference
between anemia screening vs monitoring and diagnosis in Sup-
plementary Figure 7.
Optimizing sensitivity is of paramount importance for a
screening tool, due to the ability to correctly identify a high
percentage of anemia cases even if this negatively impacts spe-
cificity. In its current form, our technology requires the user to
simply obtain a fingernail image, which can then be analyzed with
an on-board smartphone app that comprises our image analysis
algorithm to output the Hgb level measurement or be transmitted
remotely to another device (e.g., laptop, desktop computer, cloud-
based server with our algorithm embedded into their systems) for
remote analysis, the results of which can be immediately trans-
mitted back to the user. After identifying subjects that may
possibly be anemic, either type of system can recommend con-
firmatory Hgb level testing with a CBC, allowing any false posi-
tives to avoid unnecessary treatment. Given the ever-increasing

Fig. 4 Personalized calibration further improves the accuracy of Hgb levels measurement. a Healthy and chronically transfused anemic patients were
monitored over four weeks (i.e., over the course of a therapeutic blood transfusion cycle). CBC Hgb levels (white text) were used in conjunction with the
images to generate a personalized algorithm for each individual. b The patient-specific algorithms were used to measure Hgb levels over a subsequent
blood transfusion cycle. This patient-specific calibration improved the average error of Hgb level measurements to within 0.41 g dL−1 of the CBC Hgb level.
Bland–Altman analysis shows negligible experimental bias in the data. A random effects model is used to statistically confirm consistency of average Hgb
level measurement error between individual subjects. The average error (solid black line) indicates the Hgb measurement of the smartphone app is
negligibly biased. The dashed line represents the correlation (r = −0.24) between the residual error and the average of Hgb level measurements obtained
from the CBC and the algorithm. The solid red lines represent 95% limits of agreement (0.92 g dL−1). n = 4 patients, 4 measurements per patient

 measurement algorithm allows those at risk of anemia to monitor
their conditions using only the native hardware included with
their own smartphone2,3. This is particularly pertinent in low
resource settings, where, contradictory to the relative lack of
medical infrastructure, mobile phone networks are quite extensive
and have leapfrogged landlines37.
Additionally, this system has the potential to fundamentally
alter the management of patients with chronic anemia. During
the course of several weeks, a patient may take images of their
fingernail beds and enter their CBC-measured Hgb levels that
were obtained as part of their regular outpatient clinical care.
Results suggest that these images and Hgb levels may be used to
teach the smartphone phone to develop a calibration personalized
and tailored to each individual patient. In times of clinical stress,
these patients, such as those with genetic causes of anemia or
cancer undergoing chemotherapy, may experience rapid, life-
threatening, precipitous drops in Hgb and require constant
monitoring to determine their need for transfusions. Using this
technology, patients could potentially self-monitor their anemia
from the comfort of their own home, rather than through
inconvenient and recurring clinic visits. In addition, some
patients with chronic anemia due to a genetic etiology require
chronic transfusions to survive. These scheduled transfusions are
currently administered at convenient and regular intervals, and
not based on clinical need38. Hence, a patient may be transfused
too early, exposing them to unnecessary transfusion-related
effects (i.e., iron overload, risk of infection), while patients
transfused too late may require urgent hospitalization if they
develop symptomatic anemia or their Hgb levels decrease to a
dangerous level. By enabling continuous and simple monitoring,
this technique may empower patients and lead to better allocation
of blood bank resources. Moreover, further data collection will
increase the size of the patient image pool, facilitating the
incorporation of deep machine learning Big Data techniques to
further refine the Hgb measurement algorithm39.
Furthermore, this CBC-validated, smartphone image-based
smartphone app for measuring Hgb has the potential to drama-
tically improve upon the accuracy, cost, and convenience of
current Hgb measurement devices while also eliminating the need
for anything other than a smartphone, representing a significant
improvement over other POC Hgb measurement technolo-
gies7,8,20,21,40. With this smartphone image-based Hgb measure-
ment system, any person—healthy or ill—in any location, at any
time, now has access to an important health metric and may seek
care accordingly. Moreover, healthcare officials in low resource
settings may use this technology to inform allocation of limited
healthcare resources (e.g., transfusions, high-risk obstetrical ser-
vices) and medications (e.g., nutritional supplementation such as
iron, folate, or vitamin B12)41 for the patients with the most
severe anemia. This completely noninvasive, algorithm-based
approach represents a paradigm shift in the way anemia can be
screened, diagnosed, and monitored globally. As the system
requires no reagents or equipment, the healthcare cost savings
could also be significant.
Overall, the ability to conduct self-testing using an unmodified
smartphone presents significant advantages over previously
reported technologies which require additional equipment such
as calibration cards and light-blocking rigs. Moreover, the app
utilizes metadata that is automatically obtained from the smart-
phone camera which enables normalization of background
lighting conditions. This presents significant conceptual advan-
tages over existing Hgb measurement technologies, as Hgb levels
can now be measured by a patient without requiring a clinic visit
or any cumbersome external equipment.
This system suffers from the potential to be impacted by dis-
eases which cause nailbed discolorations such as jaundice and
cyanosis42,43. However, it is important to point out that a large
population of our study subjects suffered from hemolytic ane-
mias, which can lead to jaundice. We found no correlation
between disease state and Hgb measurement error, indicating that
jaundice is unlikely to impact Hgb measurement (Fig. 4). Fur-
thermore, the image analysis algorithm can potentially be trained
in future studies on populations with these disorders to take these
discolorations into account. We would also argue that suffering
from cardiovascular dysfunction sufficient to cause cyanosis, is a
significant enough health problem to render anemia diagnosis a
secondary concern, thus obviating the need for these patients to
use
this
app
under
those
circumstances.

 conditions may present challenges in Hgb measurement, they
present a promising opportunity to use the app to screen for such
diseases.
The primary limitations in this study were derived from the
use of a single smartphone model and test administrator.
Going forward, the potential for user error as well as inter/
intra-smartphone variability leading to Hgb measurement
error will be addressed in the form of a full clinical assessment,
and we will also investigate the efficacy of the smartphone
image-based algorithm in which patients will use this app as a
self-test using multiple models and manufacturers of smart-
phones. This study will also evaluate and improve upon our
quality control measures. Overall, the ability to conduct rapid
on-demand self-testing demonstrates the versatility of the
system and could be especially conducive for global heath
applications, where remote diagnosis coupled with tight quality
control measures may be preferred and enabled by increasing
smartphone use and mobile network prevalence in low
resource settings36. This approach will shift the anemia
screening paradigm worldwide by empowering patients to test
themselves from the comfort of their own homes, wherever and
whenever they desire.
Methods
Clinical assessment of app. A clinical assessment was conducted at Children’s
Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University of School of Medicine, and Georgia
Institute of Technology to relate fingernail bed color to Hgb levels. Patients with
various anemia etiologies scheduled to have their Hgb levels measured via a CBC as
part of their clinical care were recruited to this study (n = 265). Subjects were
excluded by quality control measures if their images showed fingernail beds that
were obscured or discolored due to leukonychia, nailbed injury, nail polish, dar-
kening due to medication44, etc. Exclusions were conducted to eliminate unne-
cessary variables that could obfuscate algorithm development. All CBC’s were
conducted using blood samples collected via venous blood draw. After patient’s
blood was collected to conduct their CBCs, two images were taken of those
patients’ fingernail beds. Smartphone pictures were obtained with the camera flash
both on and off. All images were taken with an Apple iPhone 5s (Apple, Cupertino,
CA) using all default imaging settings. Prior to imaging, the auto-focus and
brightness adjustment of the smartphone camera was activated by tapping the
screen in order to focus on the nailbed. To ensure consistent images, each image
was taken with the smartphone at a distance of ~0.5 m from the subjects’ fingernail
beds. If possible, subjects were encouraged to curl their fingers inwards with their
palms facing upwards to control for possible alterations in blood flow caused by
hand and finger positioning that could potentially affect the underlying color of the
fingernail beds (Fig. 1). Images were taken in clinic examination rooms, where
lighting conditions and room illuminants were relatively consistent. A digital light
meter (Hisgadget, Union City, CA) was placed next to the subject’s fingernail beds
to further ensure consistent background lighting conditions, but external digital
light meter readings were not incorporated into the Hgb level calculation. An
additional 72 healthy subjects from Emory University and The Georgia Institute of
Technology were tested using an identical protocol. CBC’s were conducted on each
subject prior to imaging and were analyzed via the same clinical hematology
analyzer (Advia 2120i, Siemens, Berlin, Germany) used in the clinical study. All
imaging was conducted in a room with similar lighting conditions to the clinic
exam rooms, which was confirmed via digital light meter. Fingernail bed images
and blood Hgb levels were analyzed in a total of 337 subjects. These subjects’ blood
Hgb levels ranged between 5.9 and 16.8 g dL−1 (Supplementary Figure 8A). Sub-
ject’s ages ranged between 1 and 60 years old and had varying skin tones (Sup-
plementary Figure 8B). 167 female subjects and 170 male subjects were enrolled in
this study. In six cases, fingernail polish was discovered after informed consent had

ment. In one case, an image labeled as having been taken with the camera flash on
was discovered to have been taken with the flash off, resulting in this subject’s data
being excluded.
Algorithm development/image processing. Smartphone images were trans-
ferred or transmitted from the smartphone used in the study to a computer.
Fingernail data, skin color data, and image metadata were extracted from fingernail
bed smartphone images via MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Regions of
interest, from which fingernail and skin color data were extracted, were manually
selected to ensure that fingernail irregularities were excluded from analysis. These
regions of interest were selected from each finger, excluding the thumb, and were
900 pixels2, corresponding to ~10 mm2 on the fingernail. Color data were extracted
from each region and averaged together across fingers for each subject. This was
shown to be an acceptable method due to the low color variability between dif-
ferent fingers (Supplementary Figure 9). An algorithm was then written in
MATLAB utilizing robust multi-linear regression with a bisquare weighting algo-
rithm to relate the image parameter data to CBC Hgb levels for each patient (Eq.
(1))45.
HemoglobinResult ¼ C þ P1 ´ W1þP2 ´ W2þ ¼ Pn ´ Wn where: C = constant,
W = weights determined via robust multi linear regression, and P = skin color
data, and image metadata parameters.
A uniform bias adjustment factor was also added to address the inherent
variability in fingernail measurement. Two distinct use models and algorithms were
applied for this Hgb measurement method: (1) as a noninvasive, smartphone-
based, quantitative Hgb level diagnostic requiring calibration with CBC Hgb levels
that enables chronic anemia patients to self-monitor their Hgb levels, and (2) as a
noninvasive, smartphone-based anemia screening test that does not require
calibration with CBC Hgb levels. Sampling strategies were used to generate the
algorithm depending on the specific application.
Anemia screening among the general population: To develop the algorithm as a
tool to screen for anemia, the entire study population (337 subjects) was randomly
split into a discovery group (237 subjects) and a testing group (100 subjects). The
discovery group was used to establish the relationship between image parameters
and Hgb levels via robust multi-linear regression, much like the calibration phase
of the personalized calibration study. A testing group, analogous to the testing
phase of the personalized calibration study, of 100 subjects was used to validate the
resultant algorithm. Validation was performed by applying the smartphone
algorithm to each testing image and comparing the algorithm generated Hgb result
with the CBC Hgb result (i.e., determining the residual of the algorithm-based
method). This process was repeated 1000 times with different, randomly-selected
without replacement, discovery/testing groups to minimize residual error, thereby
optimizing the parameters of the algorithm for anemia screening. Resulting data
from most accurate outcome of this optimized screening algorithm is depicted in
Fig. 2. Hgb measurements taken from the previously described personalized
calibration study were not included in this anemia screening study.
Personalized calibration of Smartphone App: A personalized calibration
approach was tested in two β-thalassemia major patients with chronic anemia
currently undergoing chronic transfusion therapy, a healthy female subject with
Hgb levels that fluctuated during her menstrual cycle, and a healthy male subject
with consistent Hgb levels over an identical timeframe to assess the algorithm’s
capability to be accurately personalized and calibrated to that individual, regardless
of their diagnosis or Hgb levels. Treatment for β-thalassemia major currently
comprises red blood cell transfusions to compensate for the patients’ ineffective
erythropoiesis46. Hgb levels in the chronic anemia patients fall throughout a 4-
week transfusion cycle, which was chosen as an appropriate time interval for this
study. Smartphone Images were obtained with and without the camera flash. Prior
to each imaging session, CBC Hgb levels were obtained from each subject via
venipuncture. Color data and phone metadata were compiled and a relationship
between image data and CBC Hgb levels was established via robust multi-linear
regression. This process was repeated for each individual using data from the
4 weeks of images to create a unique calibration curve personalized for that
individual. Image parameter changes associated with Hgb level fluctuations specific
to each person were related to perform algorithm calibration specific to each
subject, thus improving the accuracy of Hgb level estimation. After the smartphone
image analysis system was calibrated for each subject, Hgb levels were measured
weekly over the next 4 weeks using the newly personalized algorithm. These Hgb
level measurements were then compared to the CBC Hgb levels obtained at the
same time to assess accuracy. This personalized calibration occurred over a total of
8 weeks.
Hemoglobin measurement from images of fingernails. Images were taken of
50 subjects fingernails from the previously described clinical study. These subjects’
ages ranged from 1 to 62 years old. Hematologists (M.D. physicians who specialize
in clinical hematology and are trained and Board Certified in the USA) were
instructed to analyze each image and measure Hgb levels. For comparison, images
were loaded into the app, and the Hgb measurement protocol was performed on
these images. All images and analysis were taken using an iPhone 5S. It is
important to note that these images were not used in the development of the
underlying image analysis algorithm.
Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) reflects not only degree of correlation
but also agreement between measurements and ranges between 0 and 1, with values
closer to 1 representing stronger reliability. Reliability refers to the degree of
agreement among raters. It gives a score of how much homogeneity, or consensus,
there is in the ratings given by different judges or instruments. The ICC is able to
incorporate the reliability of more than 2 raters-as in the case of the 5
hematologists evaluating nail beds. Patients and the physicians were assumed to be
random samples from the respective populations they represent.
App development. The Hgb level measurement algorithm was incorporated into
mobile apps. The open source integrated development environment (IDE) Android
Studio (Google, Mountain View, CA) was used to develop a beta version of the Hgb
measurement app in the Android operating system. The proprietary IDE Xcode
(Apple, Cupertino, CA) was used to develop a beta version of the app in the iOS
operating system.
Human subjects research statement. All experiments complied with all relevant
ethical guidelines for human subject research, namely, the Declaration of Helsinki.
Verbal assent and written consent were obtained from all study subjects and their
parents (age permitting) in accordance with HIPAA regulations prior to partaking
in the study. All experiments involving human subjects in this manuscript were
approved by either the Emory University IRB (algorithm development—approval
number 00081226) or the Georgia Institute of Technology IRB (skin temperature
and heart rate interference—approval number H17118).
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined via two-
tailed Student’s t-test assuming unequal variance. All statistical tests (calculation of
regression correlation coefficients and Student’s t-tests were conducted using
Origin Pro 2017 student version. 95% confidence intervals for sensitivity and
specificity are calculated according to the efficient-score method. A two-way ran-
dom effects model was used to estimate our ICC for measuring agreement between
the app and hematologists at measuring Hgb levels based on physical examination.
