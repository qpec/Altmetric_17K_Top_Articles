Abstract
Background—With tetanus being a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and 
mortality in low and middle income countries, ensuring that pregnant women have geographic 
access to tetanus toxoid (TT) immunization can be important. However, immunization locations in 
many systems may not be placed to optimize access across the population. Issues of access must 
be addressed for vaccines such as TT to reach their full potential.
Methods—To assess how TT immunization locations meet population demand in Mozambique, 
our team developed and utilized SIGMA (Strategic Integrated Geo-temporal Mapping 
Application) to quantify how many pregnant women are reachable by existing TT immunization 
locations, how many cannot access these locations, and the potential costs and disease burden of 
not covering geographically harder-to-reach populations. Sensitivity analyses covered a range of 
catchment area sizes to include realistic travel distances and to determine the area some locations 
would need to cover in order for the existing system to reach at least 99% of the target population.
Results—For 99% of the population to reach health centers, people would be required to travel 
up to 35km. Limiting this distance to 15km would result in 5,450 (3,033–7,108) annual cases of 
neonatal tetanus that could be prevented by TT, 144,240 (79,878–192,866) DALYs, and 
$110,691,979 ($56,180,326–$159,516,629) in treatment costs and productivity losses. A 
catchment area radius of 5km would lead to 17,841 (9,929–23,271) annual cases of neonatal 
tetanus that could be prevented by TT, resulting in 472,234 (261,517–631,432) DALYs and 
$362,399,320 ($183,931,229–$522,248,480) in treatment costs and productivity losses.

 Conclusion—TT immunization locations are not geographically accessible by a significant 
proportion of pregnant women, resulting in substantial healthcare and productivity costs that could 
potentially be averted by adding or reconfiguring TT immunization locations. The resulting costs 
savings of covering these harder to reach populations could help pay for establishing additional 
immunization locations.

INTRODUCTION
With tetanus being a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in low 
and middle income countries, ensuring that pregnant women have geographic access to 
tetanus toxoid (TT) immunization can be important. Tetanus results from toxins produced by 
Clostridium tetani that block neurotransmitter release and leads to generalized muscle 
spasm, respiratory compromise, and autonomic dysfunction.[1] The TT vaccine is a routine 
part of many countries’ World Health Organization (WHO) expanded program on 
immunization (EPI) regimens. Studies have shown the TT vaccine to be highly efficacious 
(80–100%) in preventing neonatal tetanus (NNT).[2] However, the continuing occurrence of 
NNT – which is estimated to have caused 61,000 deaths in 2011[3] – suggests that many 
pregnant women are not receiving the TT vaccine. Indeed, only 64% of pregnant women are 
estimated to have received at least two doses of TT in 2014.[4] As previous work has shown, 
distance to the closest immunization location can be an impediment to a person getting 
immunized.[5] However, immunization locations in many systems may not be placed in a 
planned manner to optimize access across the population. Instead, decision makers may 
prioritize other factors, such as political considerations.[6] Issues of access must be 
addressed in order for vaccines in the current routine immunization schedule to reach their 
full potential, let alone new and upcoming vaccines.
To determine how well the TT immunization locations meet the population demand in 
Mozambique, our team developed and utilized SIGMA (Strategic Integrated Geo-temporal 
Mapping Application) to quantify how many people in the relevant target population are 
reachable by existing TT immunization locations in Mozambique, how many cannot access 
these locations, and the potential costs and disease burden of not reaching these 
geographically harder-to-reach populations.
METHODS
Mozambique Population and Immunization
Mozambique is a low-income country in southern Africa with a population of 25,727,911.
[7] Based on data from the Ministry of Health (MOH), the EPI in Mozambique administers 
vaccines to the population at 1,377 health centers located throughout the country. The EPI 
schedule currently includes TT for pregnant women, who on average comprise 5% of the 
population, to prevent neonatal tetanus.

 SIGMA
For this study, we developed SIGMA for Immunization, a geospatial information system 
(GIS) to estimate the population that may be reachable by specified immunization locations. 
SIGMA is written in the Python and Javascript programming languages, using the Django 
web application framework[8] and Leaflet interactive mapping library[9], and includes 
points-of-interest (POI) data from OpenStreetMap[10] as well as population density data 
from the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP)[11]. A SIGMA-generated model 
allows one to place immunization locations on a map and draw a catchment area around 
each location. The model overlays these catchment layers onto geospatially explicit 
population data that incorporates the immunization target population based on relevant 
demographic statistics (e.g. crude birth rate to estimate newborn population and different age 
groups of the population over time). SIGMA can be used to characterize the population 
served by these catchment areas, and the populations not served by any catchment area. 
Using a combination of disease risk, vaccine efficacy, and cost and burden of each disease 
case, the reachable and unreachable populations can be translated into disease cases, costs 
(e.g. treatment and productivity losses), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
Data Sources
We searched four major electronic databases (the United States National Library of 
Medicine and the National Institutes of Health Medical (PubMed)[12], WHO Global Health 
Observatory Data Repository[11], Scopus[13], and EconLit[14]) to locate peer-reviewed 
studies and grey literature on the costs and health effects of tetanus between 2005 and 2014. 
Our primary focus was the disease risk, vaccine efficacy, and costs and burden per case of 
neonatal tetanus in Mozambique; however, due to the limited number of papers specific to 
this country, we expanded our search to include other countries. The search, performed in 
2015, used variations of the following keywords: “tetanus,” “epidemiology,” AND 
“economics.” Relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and a full listing of all 
types of impact evaluations were used in the search. Additional manual bibliographic 
searches from relevant review papers revealed additional articles and grey literature. We 
limited our search to English and French studies presenting tetanus impact data conducted 
between 2005 and 2014 in Mozambique and other African countries.
We based our estimates of disease risk and burden on baseline, high, and low values found in 
the literature. We used 100% (80%–100%) for TT vaccine efficacy[2], with unprotected 
individuals developing neonatal tetanus at a rate of 23 per 1,000 live births[15]. Each case of 
neonatal tetanus incurs $3,410 ($1,705–$5,114) in treatment costs in 2015 USD[16] and 
$16,903 ($16,820–$17,327) in productivity losses (based on a $639 GNI per capita[17]). 
Productivity losses represent the net present value of all productivity lost over the lifetime of 
the patient due to illness, disability, and loss in life years. Each case also incurs 26.5 (26.3–
27.1) DALYs[18], based on disability weights of 0.640 per acute episode of tetanus, 0.388 
for motor deficits, and 0.469 for mental retardation in children 0–4 years of age[19, 20]. To 
estimate treatment costs, we converted costs from Brazil reported in 2010 USD to 
Mozambican Meticais (MZN), accounting for the purchase power parity (PPP). We used the 
monetary conversion rates from USD to Brazilian Real (BRL) in 2010 (year of reported 
costs), the PPP conversion factor for BRL into PPP International dollar ($Int) in 2010, and

 the PPP conversion factor for Mozambican Metical (MZN) into PPP $Int in 2010. We used 
these indicators in Equation 1 to derive the Mozambican cost equivalent.

Immunization Location Catchment Area Scenarios
Each scenario tested a catchment area radius for health centers (i.e. the greatest distance 
pregnant women may travel to obtain TT) to determine the percentage of the population 
reachable by these locations. As data on the actual catchments are lacking, sensitivity 
analyses covered a range of catchment area sizes to include realistic travel distances and to 
determine the area some locations would need to cover in order for the existing system to 
reach at least 99% of the target population.
For each scenario, we quantified the number of pregnant women who would fall outside the 
catchment area of any health center. We estimated the annual number of vaccine-preventable 
cases of neonatal tetanus each scenario would incur among unreachable populations 
(Equation 2), as well as the resulting DALYs, healthcare costs, and societal costs in the form 
of productivity losses. Costs are reported in 2015 USD assuming a 3% discount rate.

RESULTS
Population Reachable and Not Reachable by TT Immunization Locations
Figure 1 shows the relationship between catchment radius and target population covered. 
The population covered increases at an accelerating rate until it peaks at 17% additional 
population coverage for each added kilometer in catchment area radius. Beyond a radius of 
4km, each subsequent gain in population coverage requires a larger increase in catchment 
area radius. A health center catchment area radius of 5km would cover only 40% of the 
population (Table 1), meaning 775,715 pregnant women could not be reached by health 
centers for tetanus immunization. A radius of 15km would cover 82%, and a catchment area 
radius of 30km covers 98% of the population. For 99% of the population to reach health 
centers, people would be required to travel up to 35km. The rapid rise in coverage at lower 
catchment radii suggests that urban or densely populated areas are saturating, and capturing 
people in rural or less densely populated areas requires much wider reach by the health 
centers.

 Figure 2 displays SIGMA geographic visualizations of six scenarios with progressively 
larger catchment area radii. In all scenarios, rural populations are overrepresented among 
those unreachable by immunization locations. Even at a catchment area radius of 35km 
(Figure 2F), visible gaps in coverage exist in Gaza, Niassa, and Cabo Delgado provinces.
Economic Impact of Covering the Currently Hard to Reach Populations
As the population covered increases at a diminishing rate after the catchment area radius 
surpasses 4km, vaccine-preventable disease cases, costs, and DALYs decrease with similarly 
diminishing returns (Table 1). A catchment area radius of 5km would lead to 17,841 (9,929–
23,271) annual vaccine-preventable cases of neonatal tetanus, resulting in 472,234 
(261,517–631,432) DALYs and $362,399,320 ($183,931,229–$522,248,480) in treatment 
costs and productivity losses. A 15km catchment area radius would reduce the annual 
vaccine-preventable cases to 5,450 (3,033–7,108) to incur 144,240 (79,878–192,866) 
DALYs and $110,691,979 ($56,180,326–$159,516,629) in costs. Reaching 99% of the 
population would lead to 297 (165–387) vaccine-preventable cases annually, which 
translates to 7,853 (4,349–10,500) DALYs and $6,026,181 ($3,058,513–$8,684,243) in 
costs.
Because not everyone who is geographically reachable may be compliant with the 
recommended immunization schedule, a number of vaccine-preventable cases, costs, and 
DALYs may occur within the catchment areas of health centers. Even in the scenario where 
each health center is able to cover a 35km radius, meaning 99% of all pregnant women are 
reachable, a 10% TT refusal rate would raise the annual vaccine-preventable cases to 3,226 
(1,795–4,207), leading to 85,380 (47,282–114,162) DALYs and $65,521,552 ($33,254,642–
$94,422,172) in treatment costs and productivity losses.
DISCUSSION
Our study shows that a significant proportion of pregnant women in Mozambique may not 
have ready geographic access to current TT immunization locations, potentially resulting in 
substantial costs to society via healthcare costs and productivity losses. Studies have shown 
the value of TT immunization.[2] However, when pregnant women cannot even reach 
immunization locations, other approaches to increasing TT coverage – such as advocacy and 
communications, training, new administration technologies, and decreased vaccine prices – 
would have little effect.
It is unclear how far pregnant women may be willing to travel for TT immunization. This 
would depend on the transportation available, the terrain, and each individual’s family and 
social situation. The distance at which TT immunization becomes unmanageable for 
pregnant women varies by region, but studies suggest that the location of vaccination 
services relative to an individual’s household is a significant factor in the uptake of TT 
vaccine. A study by Perry, et al. conducted in Bangladesh found that the distance from a 
woman’s household to the nearest immunization center significantly affected the odds of 
seeking a second dose of TT, with a household distance of greater than 4km reducing 
coverage by a factor of 0.47.[21] Studies conducted in Jordan and Ghana also found a 
significant association between the accessibility of health centers and low TT coverage

 amongst pregnant women.[22, 23] Available studies suggest that traveling 35km will be 
unrealistic for most pregnant women and that in most cases pregnant women will not travel 
further than 11km.[24]
It appears that in Mozambique a large percentage of geographically unreachable populations 
are located in rural areas which are much less densely populated than the urban centers. 
According to a 2003 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) report, 81% of children living 
in urban areas in Mozambique were fully immunized as compared to only 56% of their rural 
counterparts.[25] These disparities in coverage levels may be even more pronounced in 
individual districts, with children in rural Maputo province achieving full immunization 
status at coverage levels approximately 40% lower (49.2%) than that of their urban 
counterparts Maputo city (90.2%).[26]
A number of factors contribute to the reduced ability of individuals in rural areas to access 
immunization services. As families living in rural areas tend to have lower household 
incomes, even the cost of lost wages and transportation to a health center can prove to be 
prohibitive. Additionally, health services staff are not distributed evenly throughout the 
country. The existing health services infrastructure in many rural districts often lacks the 
resources required to reach remote communities, while low population density produces 
large catchment areas in many districts.[27] In Mozambique, tetanus immunization largely 
occurs at fixed vaccination locations such as health centers or antenatal clinics whose 
placement is typically based on political boundaries or population density. It is estimated, 
however, that 50% of the population is not currently served by the existing health network 
sites.[26] Many districts have communities that are difficult to access with existing health 
services infrastructure, making outreach essential to improving coverage at the district level. 
Despite the need for outreach, a lack of capacity and resources often hinders the ability to 
implement these activities in remote communities, as the necessary transportation resources 
are available at only 30% of fixed health facilities.[26] Other potential solutions that do not 
involve adding immunization sites include providing transportation to bring women to 
existing health centers or reimbursing them for their travel expenses, as well as providing 
additional compensation for their time. Such interventions may cost less than outreach 
immunization activities and may provide the opportunity for pregnant women to also receive 
other services provided at health centers that are not available at outreach sessions.
Of course, geographical access does not guarantee that pregnant women will receive tetanus 
immunization. Even for pregnant women living in close proximity to a health facility, low 
education levels and a lack of awareness regarding the need for immunization can lead to a 
reluctance to seek TT. Negative attitudes and beliefs regarding vaccination, which can be 
cultural or religion-based, also reduce uptake. This may particularly be the case for women 
who feel religious or household pressure to not get the vaccine. Additionally, socioeconomic 
status has been found to be a deterrent to vaccination.[28] Women of low socioeconomic 
status may not be able to leave their household or work duties for the time required to travel 
to a health facility or they may simply not be able to afford immunization. Even if the 
vaccine is provided free of charge, the indirect costs of transportation and time being away 
from work may be too high.[29] Previous interactions with health facility workers can also 
affect the decision of pregnant women to seek vaccination based on misinformation or a

 negative experience. Given these challenges, immunization locations should be configured to 
ensure geographic access does not pose yet another barrier to immunization.
LIMITATIONS
Fundamentally, models provide simplified portrayals of reality and cannot embody all 
factors that affect immunization coverage and impact. This analysis uses the population 
density of Mozambique from 2000 (from currently available data) extrapolated to estimates 
of the current number of pregnant women, which should provide a reasonable estimate for 
this analysis but may miss some details that would be elucidated by collecting more recent 
data. Additionally, the determination of catchment areas is solely based on straight-line 
distance from a location, which may not capture factors such as travel times and geographic 
variation. Disease cost and impact data for Mozambique were sparse and, in some cases, 
supplemented with data from other countries. While we report a range for each result, it is 
possible that more localized input values may lead to different effect sizes.
CONCLUSION
Our study shows that TT immunization locations, as currently configured, are not 
geographically accessible by a significant proportion of pregnant women, which is resulting 
in substantial healthcare and productivity costs to society that could potentially be averted by 
adding or reconfiguring TT immunization locations. The resulting costs savings of covering 
these harder to reach populations could help pay for establishing additional immunization 
locations.
