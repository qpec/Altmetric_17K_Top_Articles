Models of the evolution of sexual cannibalism argue that males may offset
the cost of cannibalism if components of the male body are directly allocated
to the eggs that they fertilize. We tested this idea in the praying mantid
Tenodera sinensis. Males and females were fed differently radiolabelled crick-
ets and allowed to mate. Half of the pairs progressed to sexual cannibalism
and we prevented cannibalism in the other half. We assess the relative allo-
cation of both male-derived somatic materials and ejaculate materials into
the eggs and soma of the female. Our results show that male somatic invest-
ment contributes to production of offspring. The eggs and reproductive
tissues of cannibalistic females contained significantly more male-derived
amino acids than those of non-cannibalistic females, and there was an
increase in the number of eggs produced subsequent to sexual cannibalism.
Sexual cannibalism thus increases male material investment in offspring. We
also show that males provide substantial investment via the ejaculate, with
males passing about 25% of their radiolabelled amino acids to females via
the ejaculate even in the absence of cannibalism.
1. Introduction
Sexual cannibalism occurs when a female consumes a male before, during or
after mating. Rates of sexual cannibalism are highly variable among species
[1–3]. In praying mantids that exhibit sexual cannibalism, it occurs in 13–28%
of natural encounters in the field [4–5], thus imparting significant mortality on
males during the breeding season. Unlike some sexually cannibalistic spiders
[6–10], male mantids can mate repeatedly and potentially fertilize multiple
females during their lifetime [4,11–13]. Thus, all else being equal, male mantids
should be under significant selection to reduce to cost of falling prey to a mate.
Sexual cannibalism necessarily eliminates the possibility of future mating
for the male, but this cost might be at least partially ameliorated if he mates suc-
cessfully with the predatory female and his value as a food item allows this
female to produce more offspring [14–20]. Male sacrifice may evolve if the
chance of encountering more than one female in a lifetime is small and the con-
sumption of the male by the female operates as parental investment [21] that
increases the female’s reproductive output [14]. In spiders where sexual canni-
balism occurs, the paired pedipalps, which are the organs of sperm transfer,
regularly become damaged as a result of copulation, such that each can be
used only once, and thus strictly limiting mating frequency [6–10]. Buskirk
et al. [14] developed a model which predicts that male complicity in sexual can-
nibalism will evolve if the number of additional offspring produced as a result
of sexual cannibalism exceeds the number of additional offspring the male
could sire if he avoided cannibalism and searched for additional mates [22].
Male sacrifice may also evolve as a means of increasing paternity when the
sex ratio is male biased and thus males risk sperm competition despite low
individual male mating frequencies [23,24].

 Elgar & Schneider [22] reviewed the evidence of fecundity
benefits of sexual cannibalism, with an emphasis on spiders,
and found little support for fecundity benefits overall. How-
ever, in most mantids males represent large prey for females,
and prior studies have shown that when females consume
larger prey, they lay larger ootheca (egg cases) that contain
more eggs [18,25–27]. Ootheca may weigh 30–50% of a
female’s biomass and thus represent a tremendous invest-
ment [28]. Hurd et al. [4] estimated that in one population
of the Chinese mantis, Tenodera sinensis, males made up
63% of the diet of adult females. Thus male bodily nutrients,
when consumed by their mates, may represent an extreme
form of male reproductive investment [29]. If these resources
increase the number or fitness of offspring subsequently fath-
ered by the male, it can also be considered an extreme case of
male parental investment [21].
We tested the extent to which male-derived materials
were allocated to the eggs that were potentially available
for a male to fertilize. We used radioisotopes to follow the
flow of nutrients from males to females subsequent to
mating, in the presence and absence of sexual cannibalism.
We also determined whether nutrients derived from the
soma and the ejaculate were differentially allocated to
the eggs. Different patterns of incorporation would occur if
the ejaculate nutrients functioned specifically to incorporate
nutrients into eggs. No difference would indicate generalized
use of male-derived nutrients [30].
2. Material and methods
(a) Collection and rearing
Mantids were captured as final-instar juveniles from wild popu-
lations in Chautauqua County, NY and TN, USA. Mantids were
fed crickets (Acheta domesticus) ad libitum until maturity, after
which they were maintained on a diet of one cricket per day.
Mantids were housed as described previously [13,31,32]. We
placed individual mantids into 500 ml plastic terrariums and
maintained them at ca 228C with an ambient light cycle.
(b) Radiolabelling
We applied radiolabels to mantids by feeding them radiolabelled
crickets. Our procedure for radiolabelling crickets followed
Gwynne & Brown [33] and Brown [34]. Crickets were starved
for 2 days before applying the radiolabel. Ten microlitres of
radiolabelled
L-amino acid mixture (MP Biomedicals, Santa
Ana, CA, USA; approx. 0.5 mCi of
14C or 5 mCi
3H) were
placed by pipette onto a ca 1 � 1 cm2 of lettuce contained
within a glass Petri dish. The drop of radiolabelled amino acid
was left to dry under a fume hood and then placed in the cage
of an individual cricket. Crickets were held for 2 days to allow
them to consume the label.
Male and female mantids were randomly assigned to one
of the two radiolabel treatments and were fed one appropri-
ately labelled cricket every 2 days for a total of three
radiolabelled crickets. On alternate days, females that had con-
sumed the labelled cricket were fed an unlabelled cricket to
maintain them on a moderate diet of about one cricket per
day. Females on an ad libitum diet generally eat about two
crickets per day; thus we provided a diet that neither starved
nor satiated females. Total radioisotope incorporated by the
mantids was measured as the total titre of radioisotope quan-
tified by liquid scintillation counting (see below) summed
across all somatic and reproductive tissues. Male T. sinensis
incorporated on average 8.51 + 3.20 hCi of 14C or 160.08 +
52.55 hCi of 3H, according to isotope treatment, which was
equivalent to about 1.7% and 1.1%, respectively, of the radio-
isotope initially provided to the crickets that the males
consumed. Although mean dosages were very different, there
was also large variation in amounts incorporated by males,
and thus a non-significant difference between isotope treat-
ments (F1,20 ¼ 4.24, p ¼ 0.06), in amount of isotope within
males.
(c) Experimental design
Six days after consuming their first radiolabelled cricket, females
were paired with a male that had received the opposite radiola-
bel. We measured male pronotum length as an estimate of body
size. Both males and females were weighed and assigned to
either cannibalism or no-cannibalism treatments. Males were pre-
sented to females in 3-l plastic cages and were allowed to mate.
In all cases, we eliminated precopulatory cannibalism by orient-
ing the male to the back of the female, away from her predatory
strike. For pairs assigned to the cannibalism treatment, we
allowed cannibalism to occur any time after the onset of
copulation, and we maintained pairs together until the female
consumed the male. For pairs assigned to the no-cannibalism
treatment, we observed them until copulation ended and then
immediately separated males and females. We recorded the
duration of copulation for all pairs.
After mating trials, males of the no-cannibalism treatment
were immediately frozen, as were any unconsumed parts of
males from the cannibalism treatment. We later dissected
non-cannibalized males into reproductive organs (testes and
accessory glands) and soma (rest of body). Females were main-
tained on a diet of one cricket per day for up to 60 days, to
allow them to digest male-derived nutrients and allocate them
to somatic and reproductive tissues.
During oviposition, female mantids produce a spongy matrix
into which they deposit their eggs, which is collectively called the
ootheca. We recorded the date of oviposition and we collected
and froze oothecae as females produced them. As females
died, they were frozen and subsequently dissected into repro-
ductive (eggs and ovarian material) and somatic (rest of body)
tissues. We also measured female pronotum length. Eggs from
oothecae were counted to yield a count of total eggs laid (ovipos-
ited within ootheca) and total eggs produced (from oothecae and
ovaries).
Eggs (i.e. total ovarial eggs or total oothecal eggs), oothecal
matrix and body parts were placed into scintillation vials with
300–500 ml of tissue solubilizer (Solvable by Packard, Meriden,
CT, USA). All vials were then placed in a 50–608C water bath.
These materials were left overnight to dissolve all tissues other
than the exocuticle. We then added 5 ml of scintillation fluid
(Ultima Gold by Packard, Meriden, CT, USA) and all samples
were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS
6800, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA). Quenching
was
measured
by external
standardization.
Samples
were
counted for 10 min in triplicate.
(d) Analysis
We calculated three measures of the allocation of radioactive
amino acids from males to females. First, we calculated the pro-
portion of male radiolabel transferred to the female. This
addresses differences in overall material investment between
cannibalized and non-cannibalized males. We calculated the
total radiolabel incorporated by each male as the sum of radi-
ation across all male tissues and the tissues of the female with
which he mated, including only counts for the isotope (14C or
3H) fed to the male. For females, we generated separate totals
of (i) total radiation derived directly from crickets and (ii)
total radiation derived from males as the sum of radiation

 from separate isotopes across all female tissues, eggs and oothe-
cal matrix. To measure the material transferred between mates,
we calculated the proportion of total radiolabel that was
initially incorporated by males but recovered within females,
eggs and oothecae. This proportional measurement controls
for differences in the absolute amount of radiolabel initially
incorporated by males.
Second, we calculated the fraction of total radiolabel in eggs
and female reproductive tissues that originated from the male.
This allows us to examine whether male contribution to offspring
production increases with cannibalism. Third, we measured dis-
tribution of male radiolabel to female reproduction versus female
soma. This enables testing of whether male-derived isotopes
were differently distributed between female reproduction and
soma depending upon sexual cannibalism. This would be the
case if females used ejaculate materials differently from those
of male soma. For this analysis, we first calculated the total radio-
isotope passed from male to female. We then determined the
proportion of this total that was allocated to female reproduction
(including eggs and ootheca matrix). If ejaculate nutrients are
designed to be preferentially used for reproduction, we predict
greater proportional allocation in the no-cannibalism treatment
where the ejaculate is the only potential source of male-derived
nutrients. No difference between treatments would suggest gen-
eralized use of male somatic and ejaculate nutrients by the
female [30].
We analysed our proportional data using the general linear
model (GLM). All proportions were arcsine transformed for
analysis to meet assumptions of normality. This approach is
justified particularly when proportions generally fall within
the middle of the distribution (between 0.2 and 0.8) [35],
which is the case with our data. In each case, we analysed
the effect of cannibalism on reproductive allocation using a
GLM with backward elimination of non-significant covariates.
Cannibalism treatment (y/n) and the form of radioisotope
received by the male (14C/3H) were included as independent
variables. Covariates included male and female pronotum
length (size), duration of mating, and a male and female
body mass index (BMI) that was calculated using the residuals
of a nonlinear regression of body mass and pronotum length
[36]. Body mass increased significantly with pronotum length
in males (r ¼ 0.68, n ¼ 21, p , 0.001) but not females (r ¼
0.06, n ¼ 21, p ¼ 0.68). We also analysed the data using body
mass (g) per se, rather than BMI. The results are qualitatively
similar and are given in electronic supplementary material,
table S1.
3. Results
Mating lasted on average 3.51 +0.24 h. Females that canniba-
lized males gained significantly more mass during mating
(cannibalism: mass gain ¼ 0.62+ 0.06 g; no cannibalism:
mass gain ¼ 0.05+ 0.06 g). Males that were cannibalized
by females transferred considerably more of their dose of
radioisotope to females (figure 1a and table 1; F1,20 ¼ 63.75,
p , 0.0001); on average cannibalized males passed 88.9%
(95% CI: 73.6–98.7%) of their radioisotope whereas non-
cannibalized males passed 25.1% (95% CI: 17.9–36.8%) of
their label. The proportion transferred to females decreased
with male BMI and increased with female BMI (table 1).
No other covariates were significant (table 1).
(a) Effect of sexual cannibalism on male investment in
offspring
We next asked how sexual cannibalism affected female allo-
cation of male-derived materials into eggs and offspring.
Sexual cannibalism resulted in a significant increase in the
proportion of radioisotopes within female reproductive tis-
sues (i.e. the combination of ovaries, egg and ootheca
matrix) that were of male origin (figure 1b and table 1). On
average, 38.8% (95% CI: 32.2–45.5%) of radioisotope allo-
cated to female reproduction was of male origin when
cannibalism occurred, compared to 21.1% (95% CI: 15.2–
27.5%) without cannibalism. Allocation also increased with
male BMI; no other covariates were significant. Thus, eggs
that were produced subsequent to sexual cannibalism pos-
sessed significantly more amino acids of male somatic
origin compared with eggs produced without cannibalism,
and larger males made a larger investment in offspring.
(b) Relative allocation of radioisotope within males and
females
We then assessed if relative allocation of male-derived iso-
topes to female reproduction versus female soma differed
with and without sexual cannibalism. Different patterns of
incorporation would occur if the ejaculate nutrients func-
tioned specifically to incorporate nutrients into eggs. No

allocated to female reproduction. (Online version in colour.)

 difference would indicate generalized use of male-derived
nutrients [30]. Figure 1c shows that 67.8% (95% CI: 52.2–
84.3%) of isotope received from the male ejaculate in the
absence of cannibalism was allocated to reproduction. Simi-
larly, when females cannibalized males, and thus received
isotope both from male soma and ejaculate, the proportion
allocated to reproduction was 77.2% (95% CI: 61.9–93.8%).
These patterns of allocation did not differ significantly
(table 1) and thus there is no evidence that females allocate
male ejaculate investment differently from male somatic
investment.
(c) Egg production
The interval between mating and oviposition averaged
12.1+ 1.6 days. This period significantly decreased with
female BMI (F1,18 ¼ 4.99, p ¼ 0.045) and increased with
ootheca mass (F1,18 ¼ 6.76, p ¼ 0.023), but was not signifi-
cantly
affected
by
cannibalism
(F1,18 ¼ 2.55,
p ¼ 0.14).
Average fecundity in the experiment was 258+23 eggs. As
expected, female BMI prior to oviposition was positively
associated with total egg production (table 1), demonstrating
that BMI is a good indicator of female fecundity. Neither
treatment nor any other covariate significantly affected total
egg production. Initial oothecae may have included eggs
developed prior to mating and which could not have been
affected by the treatment. When we exclude the first ootheca,
females that cannibalized males produced significantly more
eggs (figure 2 and table 1). Subsequent to the first ootheca,
females that cannibalized males produced an average of
88.4 eggs (95% CI: 55.4–133.9 eggs), whereas females in the
non-cannibalism treatment produced 37.5 eggs (95% CI:
10.8–79.4 eggs). Again, female BMI was also positively
related to egg production.
4. Discussion
The eggs and the reproductive tissues of females contained
significantly more male-derived amino acids subsequent to
sexual cannibalism. Thus when males are subject to sexual
cannibalism, their soma provides direct material investment
in offspring. To the extent that this investment increases

 total offspring production, male somatic investment may at
least partially offset the cost of loss of future mating opportu-
nity in T. sinensis, as outlined in the model of Buskirk et al.
[14]. In the current study, we found that, subsequent to the
first ootheca, egg production increases with a mean differ-
ence of 50.9 eggs as the soma of the cannibalized male is
used for production of additional offspring. Previous studies
have shown that larger prey result in greater egg production
in both T. sinensis [25,26] and Tenodera angustipennis [27].
Given that male mantids are among the largest prey available
and that females in the field are typically food limited [37,38],
and in one study males made up 63% of female diet during
the breeding season [4], it seems likely that sexual canni-
balism increases egg production under field conditions.
Our results clearly show that male somatic investment con-
tributes to offspring production. This is further exemplified
by our discovery that male material allocation to eggs and
ovaries increases with male body size. Studies of two other
mantis species, Hierodula membranacea and Pseudomantis
albofimbriata, have shown that fecundity increases with
sexual cannibalism [18,20].
Whether the additional eggs produced after sexual canni-
balism are sufficient to create conditions under which sexual
cannibalism is an adaptive male strategy will depend upon
(i) the extent to which a cannibalized male fertilize these
additional eggs and (ii) the cost of additional reproduc-
tive opportunities that are necessarily lost as an outcome of
cannibalism [14]. Based on the numbers from our study,
cannibalized males potentially gain the opportunity to ferti-
lize an additional 50.9 eggs with their current mate but
lose the opportunity to fertilize the 258 eggs within the
average ootheca of an additional female. Thus, the avail-
ability of additional mates is crucial, and males should be
risk aversive when there is about a 20% (50.9/258) chance
or greater of remating. If mating opportunities are sufficiently
low, as occurs in some spiders [6–10], the opportunity to
fertilize even a portion of the additional eggs may select for
greater risk taking behaviour by males [13] and even
self-sacrifice [14,15].
Although sexual cannibalism increases male material
investment in offspring, male material investment is not
entirely lacking in the absence of cannibalism. Our results
also provide evidence of the transfer of amino acids via ejacu-
latory expenditure. Indeed, male T. sinensis contain massive
accessory glands [39,40] and mating lasts an average of
3.5 h ([26]; this study), suggesting that males may make a sig-
nificant material contribution to mates via the ejaculate, even
when they are not cannibalized. Subsequent to mating, males
(those not cannibalized) possessed 27% of their remaining
radiolabel within their reproductive tissues and 73% within
their soma. With or without sexual cannibalism, we found
no significant difference in the distribution of male-derived
materials between female reproduction and female soma.
Thus although females that cannibalize males receive a
greater amount of total material, there is no evidence that
amino acids consumed during cannibalism are used pro-
portionately to a greater or lesser degree than materials
passed via the ejaculate.
