Purpose
The objective of this study was to determine whether the 21-gene Recurrence Score (RS) provides
clinically meaningful information in patients with de novo stage IV breast cancer enrolled in the
Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC) 013.
Patients and Methods
TBCRC 013 was a multicenter prospective registry that evaluated the role of surgery of the primary
tumor in patients with de novo stage IV breast cancer. From July 2009 to April 2012, 127 patients
from 14 sites were enrolled; 109 (86%) patients had pretreatment primary tumor samples suitable
for 21-gene RS analysis. Clinical variables, time to first progression (TTP), and 2-year overall survival
(OS) were correlated with the 21-gene RS by using log-rank, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression.
Results
Median patient age was 52 years (21 to 79 years); the majority had hormone receptor–positive/
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative (72 [66%]) or hormone receptor–
positive/HER2-positive (20 [18%]) breast cancer. At a median follow-up of 29 months, median TTP
was 20 months (95% CI, 16 to 26 months), and median survival was 49 months (95% CI, 40 months
to not reached). An RS was generated for 101 (93%) primary tumor samples: 22 (23%) low risk (, 18),
29 (28%) intermediate risk (18 to 30); and 50 (49%) high risk ($ 31). For all patients, RS was associated
with TTP (P = .01) and 2-year OS (P = .04). In multivariable Cox regression models among 69 patients
with estrogen receptor (ER)–positive/HER2-negative cancer, RS was independently prognostic for TTP
(hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.86; P = .02) and 2-year OS (hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.14 to
2.95; P = .013).
Conclusion
The 21-gene RS is independently prognostic for both TTP and 2-year OS in ER–positive/HER2-
negative de novo stage IV breast cancer. Prospective validation is needed to determine the potential
role for this assay in the clinical management of this patient subset.

INTRODUCTION
The 21-gene Recurrence Score (RS) is a useful
clinical tool for assessing risk of distant recurrence
and magnitude of chemotherapy benefit in pa-
tients with early-stage estrogen receptor (ER)–
positive breast cancer treated with tamoxifen.1-3
The application of the 21-gene RS to clinical practice
in patients with ER-positive/node-negative disease
has been demonstrated to change treatment rec-
ommendations, and the RS has been incorporated
into both ASCO and National Comprehensive
Cancer Network treatment guidelines for early-
stage ER-positive breast cancer.4,5
In metastatic breast cancer, limited level 1
evidence guides clinical decision making; as such,
treatment recommendations are largely based on
traditional factors, such as ER, progesterone receptor,
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2),
and number and sites of metastases. International
consensus guidelines for the treatment of advanced
breast cancer have been developed,6,7 yet durability
of response to first-line therapy varies, and there are
no validated clinical tools for assessing risk of pro-
gression of disease or likelihood of achieving a

 durable response once therapy is initiated. In addition, although
survival among patients with metastatic breast cancer has improved,
largely due to advances in targeted therapy, there continues to be
a wide range in reported outcomes8-12 and there are many unan-
swered questions related to management strategies, optimal drug
sequencing, and the potential for individualized treatment on the
basis of predictive markers.
Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium (TBCRC)
013 was a multicenter prospective registry study with the primary
goal of evaluating the role of surgery of the primary tumor in
patients with stage IV breast cancer. Patients also provided primary
tumor tissue for embedded correlative science aims. The objective
of the current analysis was to determine whether the 21-gene RS
performed on the primary tumor provides clinically meaningful
information in patients with de novo stage IV breast cancer
enrolled in TBCRC 013. Further analysis of the role of surgery in
this trial is ongoing.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
TBCRC 013 was a multicenter prospective registry study that evaluated the
role of surgery of the primary tumor in patients with de novo stage IV
breast cancer. Eligibility criteria included de novo stage IV breast cancer
with an intact primary tumor (cohort A) or metastatic disease within
3 months of primary breast surgery (cohort B). All patients provided
consent for access to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from the
primary tumor and a metastatic lesion for correlative studies. We aimed to
enroll 100 patients with intact tumors and adequate primary tumor tissue
for the RS analysis.
From July 2009 to April 2012, 127 eligible patients from 14 insti-
tutions were enrolled in the two cohorts (cohort A, n = 112; cohort B,
n = 15). Of these, 109 (86%) patients had pretreatment primary tumor
diagnostic biopsy samples suitable for 21-gene RS analysis and comprised
the RS analysis cohort reported here.
Because this was a registry study, patients were treated according to
institutional practice patterns without study-specific intervention. Pre-
senting clinical and pathologic features were determined at the institu-
tional level, which included tumor grade and ER, progesterone receptor,
and HER2 status. Treatment regimens and outcomes were reported.
Baseline characteristics were compared by using Fisher’s exact test for
categorical factors and the Wilcoxon test for continuous factors. Clinical
variables, time to first progression (TTP), and 2-year overall survival (OS)
were correlated with the 21-gene RS by using log-rank tests, Kaplan-Meier
estimates, and Cox regression with medians and 95% CIs. Analyses
included all patients (any ER or HER2 status) as well as ER-positive
(immunohistochemistry [IHC]) and ER-positive and HER2-negative
subsets (IHC, fluorescence in situ hybridization). Exploratory analyses
were performed among patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast
cancer stratified by choice of first-line treatment (endocrine therapy v
chemotherapy).
RESULTS
Among the 109 patients in the 21-gene RS analysis cohort, the
median patient age was 52 years (range, 21 to 79 years), and the
median primary tumor size was 3.1 cm (range, 0.7 to 15.0 cm). The
study cohort comprised patients with predominantly ER-positive
(84%), HER2-negative (72%), and invasive ductal (86%) cancer,
and 50 (46%) patients presented with bone-only metastases
(Table 1). The only significant difference between patients enrolled
in cohort A (n = 94) and cohort B (n = 15) was the higher fre-
quency of clinical N1 disease in patients in cohort A (85% v 26%;
P = .001). There were no significant differences between the 21-
gene RS population (n = 109) and the overall TBCRC 013 registry
population (n = 127), and no differences in outcome associated
with elective surgery at the time of this analysis (data not shown).
At a median follow-up of 29 months, median TTP was 20 months
(95% CI, 16 to 26 months), and median survival was 49 months
(95% CI, 40 months to not reached; Fig 1).
RS results were successfully generated from pretreatment
diagnostic biopsy samples of the primary tumor for 101 (93%)
patients. The median and mean RS for the population were 30.7
(range, 0 to 100) and 36, respectively; the interquartile range was
19.5 to 49.5. The histogram of RS values is depicted in Appendix
Figure A1 (online only), and characteristics of the patients whose
samples failed to generate an RS are presented in Appendix Table A1.
Risk-group distribution was defined as low (RS , 18), intermediate
(RS 18 to 30), and high (RS $ 31). Twenty-two (20%) patients had a
low-risk RS, all of whom had ER-positive/HER2-negative disease by
IHC (Table 1). Among the 29 patients with intermediate-risk RS, 26
had ER-positive/HER2-negative disease and three had ER-positive/
HER2-positive disease (IHC/fluorescence in situ hybridization). The
remaining 50 (46%) patients had high-risk RS. The high-risk group
included 21 patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative tumors, 13
with ER-positive/HER2-positive tumors, 10 with ER-negative/HER2-
positive tumors, and six with triple-negative disease (Appendix
Fig A2). The only clinical variable found to be correlated with risk
group was locally reported tumor grade (Table 2).
When stratified by RS, patients with low- and intermediate-
risk scores had improved TTPand 2-year OS compared with patients
with high-risk scores. This was true when all patients were included
in the analysis, yet the difference was most pronounced among the
ER-positive/HER2-negative subset where median TTP was not
reached among those with low-risk scores and 2-year OS was 100%
for both the low- and the intermediate-risk groups (Fig 2; Table 3).
In univariable analysis, tumor grade was not significantly associated
with OS (P = .22) or TTP (P = .05). In multivariable Cox regression
models that included age and RS as continuous variables and
adjusted for tumor size and site of first metastatic disease (bone only
v other), the 21-gene RS was independently prognostic for TTP and
2-year OS in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative stage IV
disease (Table 4).
In an exploratory analysis to determine whether the 21-gene
RS may be useful in predicting response to therapy in this cohort,
we examined the 69 patients in the ER-positive/HER2-negative
group by first-line treatment received (Appendix Table A2).
Because this was a registry study, patients were selected for treatment
at the discretion of their treating physician. Forty-nine (71%)
patients received first-line endocrine therapy, and 20 (29%) re-
ceived first-line chemotherapy. Despite the correlation between
tumor grade and risk group, there was no association between
tumor grade and the decision to proceed with first-line chemo-
therapy (Appendix Table A2). Patients who received first-line
chemotherapy were younger (median age, 50 v 54 years), had
larger primary tumors, and had more visceral and multiorgan
disease, yet these differences were not statistically significant.
Eighty-five percent of the patients who received first-line che-
motherapy had intermediate-risk (n = 10) or high-risk (n = 7) RS

 values, which suggests that physicians are appropriately selecting
many patients for more-aggressive treatment; however, 61% of
the patients who received first-line endocrine therapy also had
intermediate- or high-risk RS values, which highlights the oppor-
tunity for clinical decision-making tools to affect treatment decisions
in this setting (Appendix Table A2).
In this exploratory analysis, both TTP and 2-year OS were
shorter among patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast
cancer and high-risk RS values who received first-line endocrine
therapy, whereas there was no difference by RS in TTP or 2-year OS
among those with ER-positive/HER2-negative disease and high-
risk RS values who received first-line chemotherapy (Appendix
Figs A3 and A4; Appendix Table A3). Although exploratory, these
findings suggest that a high-risk RS may be a surrogate for relative
endocrine resistance in de novo stage IV disease, which leads to the
hypothesis that RS may be a tool to select patients with ER-positive/
HER2-negative de novo stage IV breast cancer who may benefit
from first-line chemotherapy. In this cohort, use of RS $ 31
to select first-line chemotherapy or first-line endocrine therapy
would have resulted in a treatment change for 17 (25%) patients.
However, these findings require prospective validation before being
incorporated into clinical practice.
DISCUSSION
In metastatic breast cancer, the goals of care are to optimize both
length and quality of life. Several advances have been made, par-
ticularly for HER2-positive and luminal-like subtypes, and survival
has improved; however, median OS is still reported as 2 to 3 years.8-12
The use of treatment guidelines, primarily in early-stage breast
cancer, has been associated with significant improvements in sur-
vival,13 yet for metastatic breast cancer, limited level 1 evidence

Prognostic Impact of 21-Gene RS in Stage IV Breast Cancer
 exists, and only recently have international consensus guidelines
been developed.6,7 In ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer,
endocrine therapy is the preferred option, even in the presence
of visceral disease, unless there is concern or proof of endocrine
resistance or of disease needing a fast response.7 We demonstrate in
the current study that the 21-gene RS, when performed on the
primary tumor in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast
cancer, is independently prognostic for both TTP and 2-year OS in
de novo stage IV disease, which leads to the hypothesis that this
molecular profile may be useful in the clinical management of this
patient subset.
We also demonstrate that the natural history of de novo ER-
positive stage IV breast cancer differs from metastatic disease that
recurs after adjuvant therapy. At a median follow-up of 29 months,
the TTP for the whole cohort was 20 months (95% CI, 16 to
26 months), and median survival was 49 months (95% CI,
40 months to not reached). Among the 85 patients with ER-positive
disease, the median TTP ranged from 32 months for those with a
low-risk score to 15 months for those with a high-risk score. This
difference was even more pronounced in the ER-positive/HER2-
negative cohort where the median TTP for patients with a low-risk
score had not been reached at a median follow-up of 29 months.
This information could potentially be used in discussing treatment
options and expectations in this patient cohort, specifically, with
respect to the expected duration of response to first-line therapy and
subsequent need for treatment modifications.
Guidelines state that treatment choice in metastatic breast
cancer should take into account hormone receptor and HER2 status,
tumor burden (number and site of metastases), patient age, per-
formance status, comorbidities, menopausal status, and need for
rapid disease/symptom control. Because we performed the 21-gene
RS on all-comers, the majority of patients, not surprisingly, with
HER2-positive tumors, and all patients with triple-negative tumors
had high-risk RS results. Of note, we do not advocate for this
approach because treatment algorithms in patients with hormone
receptor–negative disease and HER2-positive disease differ sub-
stantially from those with hormone receptor–positive disease;
however, this analysis provides proof of principle that RS results
differ substantially by breast cancer subtype. In this data set, the
median RS values ranged from 23 (0 to 59) to 62 (33 to 73) for
patients with ER–positive/HER2-negative disease and triple-negative
disease, respectively (Appendix Fig A2). Of note, the median RS was
also correlated with tumor grade, ranging from 12 (7 to 33) among
patients with grade 1 tumors to 33 (4 to 50) among those with grade
3 tumors, yet no relationship existed between RS risk group and
other clinical factors typically considered when treatment recom-
mendations are made (Table 2).
When we limited the analysis to only patients with ER-positive/
HER2-negative disease, the distribution of low-, intermediate-, and
high-risk scores was 32%, 38%, and 30%, respectively, similar to
the distribution of scores seen in early-stage disease, and again, we
see the correlation between tumor grade and risk group (Appendix
Table A4). However, on exploration of first-line treatment choices
made independently by physicians and patients, no significant
association with tumor grade and the decision to proceed with
first-line chemotherapy or endocrine therapy was found, which
highlights the potential for the 21-gene RS to provide clinically
meaningful information for this patient cohort, although we
acknowledge that this requires further prospective study and
validation.
Patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative disease who received
first-line chemotherapy tended to be younger, and were more

 likely to have larger primary tumors, and visceral disease and/
or more than one site of metastatic disease compared with those
who received first-line endocrine therapy (Appendix Table A2).
Although these comparisons were not statistically significant, they
are consistent with the expected biases toward more-aggressive
treatment in younger women with greater disease burden. Further
exploratory analysis of TTP and survival in this cohort when
examined by first-line treatment demonstrated that both out-
comes were inferior among ER-positive/HER2-negative patients
with high-risk RS results who received first-line endocrine therapy,
whereas there was no difference by RS in TTP or 2-year OS

Prognostic Impact of 21-Gene RS in Stage IV Breast Cancer
 chemotherapy (Appendix Figs A3 and A4; Appendix Table A3).
Although exploratory, these findings suggest that a high-risk RS
may be a surrogate for relative endocrine resistance in de novo
stage IV disease. When selected by clinical criteria, 15% of patients
who received first-line chemotherapy had low-risk RS, which
suggests that endocrine therapy may have been more appropriate,
and perhaps more importantly, 61% of patients who received first-
line endocrine therapy had intermediate- or high-risk scores,
which suggests that these patients may have disease that is less
responsive to endocrine therapy, a hypothesis that requires testing
in a prospective clinical trial.
In summary, the TBCRC 013 registry population provides
new insights into the natural history of de novo stage IV breast
cancer. The majority of women with de novo stage IV breast cancer
have ER-positive/HER2-negative disease and experience durable
responses to first-line physician-directed therapy. However, within
this population, which represented more than one-third of patients
enrolled in PALOMA-3,14 the potential to individualize treatment
on the basis of predictive markers remains an unmet clinical need.
In the ER-positive/HER2-negative cohort, 30% of patients had a
high-risk RS, which is somewhat higher than that seen in the
setting of node-negative disease. If a high-risk RS was considered
an indication for chemotherapy and a low-risk RS considered a
contraindication to chemotherapy, first-line treatment decisions
would have differed for 25% of the study population, with the
potential to affect both OS and quality of life. Given the growing
body of evidence that demonstrates the ability of the 21-gene RS to
predict prognosis and benefit from chemotherapy in both early-stage
node-positive and node-negative disease,1-3,15,16 these findings suggest
that biology is the major determinant of outcome and warrant further
prospective investigation.
