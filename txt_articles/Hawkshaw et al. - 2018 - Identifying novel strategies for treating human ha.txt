Abstract
Hair growth disorders often carry a major psychological burden. Therefore, more effective
human hair growth–modulatory agents urgently need to be developed. Here, we used the
hypertrichosis-inducing immunosuppressant, Cyclosporine A (CsA), as a lead compound
to identify new hair growth–promoting molecular targets. Through microarray analysis we
identified the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), as being down-reg-
ulated in the dermal papilla (DP) of CsA-treated human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo.
Therefore, we further investigated the function of SFRP1 using a pharmacological
approach and found that SFRP1 regulates intrafollicular canonical Wnt/β-catenin activity
through inhibition of Wnt ligands in the human hair bulb. Conversely, inhibiting SFRP1 activ-
ity through the SFRP1 antagonist, WAY-316606, enhanced hair shaft production, hair shaft
keratin expression, and inhibited spontaneous HF regression (catagen) ex vivo. Collec-
tively, these data (a) identify Wnt signalling as a novel, non–immune-inhibitory CsA target;
(b) introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canonical β-catenin activity
in a human (mini-)organ; and (c) demonstrate WAY-316606 to be a promising new pro-
moter of human hair growth. Since inhibiting SFRP1 only facilitates Wnt signalling through
ligands that are already present, this ‘ligand-limited’ therapeutic strategy for promoting
human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks associated with chronic Wnt
over-activation.

 Author summary
Hair loss is a common disorder and can lead to psychological distress. Cyclosporine A, a
fungal metabolite commonly used as an immunosuppressant, can potently induce hair
growth in humans. However, it cannot be effectively used to restore hair growth because
of its toxic profile. In this study, we used Cyclosporine A as a lead compound to identify
novel therapeutic targets that can aid the development of new hair growth–promoting
agents. Through microarray analysis, we found that the level of the secreted Wnt inhibi-
tor, SFRP1, was significantly reduced by Cyclosporine A. This inspired us to design a new
pharmacological approach that uses WAY-316606, a reportedly well-tolerated and specific
antagonist of SFRP1, to prolong the growth phase of the hair cycle. We show that WAY-
316606 enhances human hair growth ex vivo, suggesting that it is a more targeted hair
growth promoter with the potential to treat human hair loss disorders.
Introduction
The current pharmacological treatment for hair loss disorders is unsatisfactory, with patients
being limited to only two FDA-approved hair growth promoters (minoxidil and finasteride),
neither of which is robustly and universally efficacious [1]. Given the severe psychological bur-
den and negative quality of life that can be associated with hair loss, additional, but safe,
human hair growth–promoting agents are urgently needed.
There are relatively few known drugs that cause excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) in
patients. Among these, the immunosuppressive calcineurin inhibitor, Cyclosporine A (CsA),
most frequently and characteristically induces hypertrichosis [2,3]. CsA also prolongs active
hair growth (anagen) in organ-cultured human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo [4,5]. Likely,
the hair growth–stimulatory effects of CsA are independent of its T cell–inhibitory activity,
because human HFs grafted onto immunocompromised nude mice treated with CsA also
show anagen prolongation in vivo [6].
CsA effects on hair growth have been studied most extensively in mice (S1 and S2 Tables),
in which CsA induces anagen in quiescent (telogen) HFs [7], reportedly through blocking the
nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc)1 in epithelial HF stem cells
(eHFSCs) [8]. Conversely, CsA inhibits HF regression (catagen) [9] (S2 Table), presumably
through blocking NFATc2 within the murine hair matrix [10]. However, this does not satisfac-
torily explain how CsA prolongs anagen in human scalp HFs, because neither active NFATc1
nor NFATc2 protein are expressed within the human anagen HF bulb [5], i.e., where catagen
development is initiated [1]. Therefore, we hypothesised that other molecular pathways must
underlie the anagen-prolonging activity of CsA in human HFs [5], and that modulating these
novel targets could achieve hair growth with better efficacy and fewer side effects than CsA
itself.
To test these hypotheses, we treated organ-cultured anagen VI human scalp HFs [11] with a
therapeutic dose of CsA (10−7M) [5], followed by microarray analysis, in situ hybridisation
(ISH), quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence microscopy, and pharma-
cological assays. To eliminate any potentially confounding effects on bulge eHFSCs [8], and
given that eHFSCs are not actively involved in mediating the anagen–catagen transition [12],
we exclusively focused on the effects of CsA within the human anagen hair bulb. Following
these experiments we identified the endogenous Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related pro-
tein 1 (SFRP1), as a novel target of CsA treatment. SFRP1 activity can be directly targeted with
the antagonist, WAY-316606, which enhances human hair growth ex vivo.

 Results and discussion
To identify novel CsA targets, we treated human HFs with CsA ex vivo (6 hours) and mea-
sured primary changes in gene transcription through microarray analysis. Among many other
differentially regulated genes (S1 Fig), the Wnt inhibitor, SFRP1 [13], demonstrated the largest
decrease (−2.3 fold change, p = 4.90E−05) (Fig 1A). As SFRP1 has not previously been investi-
gated in either the CsA literature or in the human hair bulb (S1 and S3 Tables), we next investi-
gated which intrafollicular cell population is responsible for the CsA-induced change in SFRP1
transcription. Using ISH, we found SFRP1 mRNA to be exclusively transcribed by fibroblasts
associated with the human HF bulb, with the highest SFRP1 expression seen within the dermal
papilla (DP) (Fig 1B–1D and S2 Fig).
Next, we wanted to determine if SFRP1 protein is restricted to or secreted from the DP.
Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that SFRP1 protein can be detected in both the DP
and the adjacent epithelial hair matrix and pre-cortex of human scalp HFs (Fig 1E and S2 Fig).
Based on the distinct expression patterns of SFRP1 mRNA (DP) and protein (DP and hair
matrix), these data suggest that SFRP1 is transcribed and translated in the DP and is then
secreted into the hair matrix and pre-cortex (Fig 1F).
We next asked by quantitative immunohistomorphometry whether CsA inhibits SFRP1
protein production in the human anagen hair bulb. This revealed a significant decrease in
SFRP1 protein expression within the DP (Fig 1G and 1H) and in the surrounding HF epithe-
lium (matrix and pre-cortex) (Fig 1G, 1I and 1J) after 48 hours of CsA treatment. Therefore,
CsA suppresses SFRP1 protein levels within the human HF bulb. This was corroborated by
ISH, which demonstrated a decrease in SFRP1 mRNA within the DP after CsA treatment (Fig
1K–1N), and by qRT-PCR, which showed a significant decrease in intrafollicular SFRP1
mRNA after 48 hours (Fig 1O).
To determine if CsA’s hair growth–promoting effects occur through SFRP1 and if SFRP1
negatively impacts human hair growth, we first treated human HFs ex vivo with CsA and vehi-
cle control. As a positive control, we confirmed that the percentage of anagen VI HFs was sig-
nificantly higher after CsA treatment compared to vehicle control on days 4 and 6 (S4A–S4C
Fig), validating previous reports that CsA prolongs the duration of anagen [4,5] (S2 Table).
Next, HFs were treated with vehicle control, recombinant human SFRP1 (rhSFRP1) alone, and
rhSFRP1 together with CsA. Macroscopically, the treatment of rhSFRP1 induced more HFs to
prematurely enter catagen by day 4 compared to the vehicle control (S4D–S4G Fig). The ability
of CsA to prolong anagen (S4A Fig) was blocked by the addition of rhSFRP1 with CsA, as the
percentage of anagen HFs was comparable to vehicle control over 6 days in culture (S4D Fig).
Next, we analysed morphological changes with vehicle control, rhSFRP1 alone, and rhSFRP1
with CsA-treated HFs at day 6 using Ki-67/TUNEL immunofluorescence (S5A–S5C and S6
Figs). Surprisingly, the percentage of Ki-67+ cells below Auber’s line was highest with rhSFRP1
treatment (S5E Fig). However, this did not functionally translate into hair growth stimulation,
as rhSFRP1 alone drastically reduced hair matrix size (S5D Fig), whereas treatment with
rhSFRP1 and CsA together showed no significant difference in hair matrix size compared to
vehicle control (S5D Fig). Treatment with rhSFRP1 enhanced the emigration of DP fibroblasts
to the connective tissue sheath (S5H Fig), which occurs upon catagen induction, leading to a
reduced DP volume [14,15]. Also, rhSFRP1 promoted apoptosis in fibroblasts emigrating from
the DP, which is indicative of catagen induction (S5I Fig) [14,15]. Conversely, there was no dif-
ference between control and rhSFRP1 with CsA in the emigration of fibroblasts (S5H Fig) or
TUNEL+ cells in the DP stalk (S5I Fig). Collectively, this (a) demonstrates that enhanced
SFRP1 activity induces premature catagen and (b) suggests that CsA hair growth–promoting
effects occur at least in part through inhibiting SFRP1, since the addition of rhSFRP1

 prevented CsA treatment from maintaining anagen and modulating many of these parameters
above vehicle control baseline.
Therefore, irrespective of any effects CsA might also exert on human eHFSCs, CsA treat-
ment can target the DP of human scalp HFs, i.e., the mesenchymal inductive control centre
[12,16]. This important mesenchymal HF target had been unrecognised in previous murine
work (S1 Table) yet is in line with our previous finding that CsA inhibits the emigration of
fibroblasts from the DP in human HFs [5]. This also demonstrates that CsA suppresses a mes-
enchymal-to-epithelial signal via SFRP1.
Given the key role of SFRP1 as an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signalling [17], we next asked
whether Wnt ligand activity modulates canonical β-catenin in the human HF bulb. While Wnt
ligand activity maintains anagen and hair shaft formation in the murine HF [18,19], it is
unclear whether this directly applies to humans. The distribution of cells that are Wnt active
has been described in the human HF bulb [20,21]. However, there are clear discrepancies with
the reported nuclear localisation of both β-catenin and the key canonical transcription factor
lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) in the pre-cortex [21,22] and the DP [20,23].
Therefore, we wanted to identify which cells are precisely active for canonical β-catenin signal-
ling. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed nuclear localisation of β-catenin in both
selected human HF fibroblasts (DP and DP stalk cells) and epithelial cells (hair matrix and
pre-cortical hair matrix keratinocytes) of human scalp HFs (Fig 2A and S7 Fig). In addition,
ISH revealed that the direct canonical β-catenin target genes axis inhibition protein 2 (AXIN2)
and LEF1 are both transcribed in these cell populations (Fig 2B and 2C). This identifies that
Wnt/β-catenin signalling is active in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Importantly, this
also demonstrates that β-catenin activity in the epithelial regions is not restricted to the pre-
cortex, as previously thought [21], and also occurs in the proliferating hair matrix.
We then asked which cells are secreting Wnt, beginning with analysing the expression of
Wntless (WLS), which is required for Wnt ligand secretion [18], followed by a panel of Wnt
ligands. ISH showed that WLS is present throughout the HF bulb, although with varying levels
of expression (Fig 2D and S8 Fig). Conversely, among the seven Wnt ligands we probed for,
WNT3, WNT4, WNT10A, and WNT10B were expressed and restricted to the human epithelial
hair matrix and pre-cortex, while WNT1, WNT2, and WNT3A were undetectable (S9 Fig).
Next, we assessed whether Wnt ligand activity modulates the canonical β-catenin pathway in
the human HF bulb by treating human HFs for 48 hours with inhibitor of Wnt production-2
(IWP-2), a small molecule inhibitor of Wnt ligand secretion [24]. This significantly reduced
the transcription of both AXIN2 and LEF1 (Fig 2G and 2J). Therefore, Wnt secretion is
required for maintaining canonical β-catenin activity in human scalp HFs, perfectly in line
with the most recent demonstration that WNT10A is required for normal human skin
appendage function [25].
These important background data define the location of key molecular players within the
concert of Wnt ligands, β-catenin activity, and SFRP1 production in the human anagen
HF. Notably, the secreted SFRP1 protein from the DP overlaps with specific Wnt ligands
expressed in the immediately adjacent HF epithelium (S9 Fig), suggesting that SFRP1 may
inhibit canonical β-catenin activity. This hypothesis was tested by treating human HFs ex vivo
with rhSFRP1. After 48 hours, both AXIN2 and LEF1 transcription were significantly reduced
(Fig 2H and 2K). Conversely, when we incubated human HFs with WAY-316606, a specific
and reportedly well-tolerated antagonist of SFRP1 [26], both AXIN2 and LEF1 transcription
were significantly increased (Fig 2I and 2L). Therefore, SFRP1 functions as an inhibitor of
canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling in the human hair bulb.
Furthermore, ISH showed a significant increase in AXIN2 mRNA levels in situ after WAY-
316606 treatment within both the pre-cortex and DP (Fig 2P–2T). This demonstrates that

 despite the presence of spatially very well-defined Wnt ligands (S9 Fig), the general presence of
secreted SFRP1 protein within the epithelium serves to moderate Wnt activity as AXIN2 levels
become significantly up-regulated after SFRP1 inhibition by WAY-316606, while still retaining
its spatial pattern within the human HF bulb (Fig 2P–2T). In addition, this increase in Wnt
activity is not due to an increase in ectopic nuclear β-catenin, as anagen HFs already express
maximally high levels of nuclear β-catenin (S10 Fig). Therefore, the intrafollicular increase in
β-catenin activity after SFRP1 suppression is due to a response of both pre-cortical HF kerati-
nocytes and DP fibroblasts (both regions are Wnt active, i.e., β-catenin+ LEF1+ AXIN2+).
Notably, SFRP1 transcription itself did not change after treatment with either IWP-2,
rhSFRP1, or WAY-316606 (Fig 2M–2O). This suggests that SFRP1 does not negatively regulate
its own expression and indicates that Wnt ligand activity does not control SFRP1 expression.
Taken together, our data introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canoni-
cal β-catenin activity in a human (mini-)organ, the HF. We also present the first evidence that
the SFRP1 inhibitor, WAY-316606, effectively enhances β-catenin activity in mammalian skin
cell populations, namely in both human hair pre-cortex keratinocytes and DP fibroblasts ex vivo.
β-catenin signalling is essential for murine hair growth through both the anagen-inducing
properties of the DP [19,27] and differentiation of hair matrix keratinocytes into hair shaft tri-
chocytes [28,29]. Therefore, we next addressed the clinically crucial question of whether stimu-
lating canonical β-catenin activity within both human HF compartments (Fig 2P–2T)
enhances human hair growth.
To answer this, human HFs were treated ex vivo with WAY-316606 for 6 days, and hair
shaft production was measured. WAY-316606 significantly increased hair shaft production
(elongation) as early as 2 days following treatment (Fig 3A), even faster than CsA-induced
hair shaft elongation ex vivo, which occurs several days later [4,5]. As canonical β-catenin sig-
nalling appears to control the expression of hair keratins necessary for hair shaft production
[21,28,29], we also investigated whether WAY-316606 treatment can also impact on human
hair keratin expression. Quantitative immunohistomorphometry showed that WAY-316606
treatment rapidly and significantly up-regulated protein expression of the hair shaft keratin
K85 (Fig 3B), which is expressed within the pre-cortical hair matrix and the hair shaft [30].
Therefore, antagonising SFRP1 activity enhances human hair shaft production, and do so
more effectively than CsA.
Clinically, the most important challenge in effective hair loss management is to prolong the
duration of anagen [1]. CsA achieves this through blocking catagen within both mice and man
[5,6,9]. It was therefore crucial to determine if antagonising SFRP1 activity through WAY-
316606 treatment replicates this effect of CsA.
Indeed, after 6 days of treatment with WAY-316606, a greater percentage of organ-cultured
anagen scalp HFs had remained in anagen VI, both macroscopically (Fig 3C and S11 Fig) and
microscopically, as validated by standardised, quantitative hair cycle histomorphometry [15]
(Fig 3D–3H). This corresponded to a significantly higher percentage of proliferating (Ki-67+)
hair matrix keratinocytes (Fig 3D and 3E), a greater number of DAPI+ cells below Auber’s line
(Fig 3D and 3F), and a significantly higher melanin content of WAY-316606–treated HFs (Fig
3H). In addition, the number of fibroblasts emigrating from the DP ex vivo was reduced (Fig
3D and 3G), exactly mimicking the effects of CsA [5]. However, there did not appear to be any
significant changes in cell death, as analysed by TUNEL staining of the hair matrix, DP, or DP
stalk (S12 Fig). Therefore, directly inhibiting SFRP1 activity with WAY-316606 not only stim-
ulates intrafollicular Wnt signalling but maintains anagen human HFs within the maximally
proliferative stage of the HF cycle.
Collectively, our study (a) identifies Wnt signalling as a novel target of CsA treatment that
appears unrelated to its immunosuppressive activities; (b) introduces SFRP1 as a physiologically
SFRP1 inhibition as a novel strategy to promote human hair growth

 important regulator of canonical β-catenin activity in a human (mini-)organ, the HF, by show-
ing that this Wnt inhibitor is a key partner in a potent new mesenchymal-epithelial interaction;
and (c) demonstrates that WAY-316606 is a promising new pharmacological promoter of
human hair growth, whose toxicity profile [26] is expected to be more favourable than that of
CsA. While we have demonstrated that CsA can modulate SFRP1, it cannot be excluded that
CsA has additional effects on the immune system or other cell types and may thus indirectly
affect catagen entry.
Interestingly, no hair abnormalities have been reported in Sfrp1 knockout mice. Once
again, this cautions against extrapolating from murine to human HF biology and only under-
scores the clinical importance of studying SFRP1 functions directly in human tissue. However,
investigators interested in murine SFRP1 biology might wish to probe whether some of the
other abnormalities reported in Sfrp1 knockout mice, e.g., increased mammary ductal branch-
ing [31] or dysregulated glucose metabolism [32], are pharmacologically reproducible in wild-
type mice by SFRP1 inhibitor treatment.
Remarkably, the extensive hair CsA literature had missed canonical Wnt signalling as a
clinically important target of this widely administered immunosuppressant. The novel
CsA-SFRP1-Wnt connection elucidated here may also help to better explain previously ill-
understood adverse effects of CsA therapy, namely gingival hyperplasia [33]. The next key chal-
lenge is to dissect the as yet unknown molecular mechanisms by which CsA inhibits SFRP1
transcription (to clarify this was beyond the scope and reach of the current translational study).
The underlying intrafollicular signalling is depicted in Fig 3I: the secreted Wnt inhibitor,
SFRP1, controls human HF cycling and hair shaft production after secretion from the DP by
interacting with Wnt ligands in the immediately adjacent HF epithelium. Manipulating
this novel mesenchymal-epithelial signal with the SFRP1 inhibitor, WAY-316606, increases
canonical β-catenin activity in both the DP and the pre-cortex. This boost in Wnt signalling
enhances human hair shaft formation and inhibits catagen entry. Therefore, Dickkopf-related
protein 1 (DKK1) is not the only important regulator of Wnt activity in the human HF [34],
and SFRP1 is a viable alternative target molecule for the therapeutic up-regulation of hair
growth–promoting Wnt signalling.
Since CsA binds and inhibits multiple targets (e.g., cyclophilin and calcineurin) [35], which
is thought to underlie its serious toxicity profile [3,33], topical inhibition of SFRP1 using
WAY-316606 would be a much more targeted approach for stimulating human hair growth
without having to use a potent immunosuppressant, particularly as thus far there are no
known off-target effects from WAY-316606 treatment. In addition, WAY-316606 is highly
selective against other closely related SFRP family members (SFRP2 and SFRP5). For example,
at 2 μM, WAY-316606 inhibits SFRP1 activity by about 40%, whereas SFRP2 and SFRP5 activ-
ity is only inhibited by about 5% and about 2%, respectively [26]. Moreover, this Wnt disinhi-
bition technique may be a safer long-term therapeutic strategy for stimulating β-catenin
activity in the human HF. Because inhibiting SFRP1 by WAY-316606 only facilitates Wnt sig-
nalling through ligands that are already present in the human HF, this ‘ligand-limited’ strategy
for promoting human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks typically associ-
ated with β-catenin stabilisation [36].

 Human HF organ culture
Male occipital scalp HFs were obtained from patients undergoing hair transplant surgery at
the Crown Cosma Clinic, Manchester, UK. Tissue was dissected, with individual full-length
anagen VI HFs cultured in serum-free Williams’ E medium (Gibco, Paisley, UK) supple-
mented with 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 10 ng/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma,
Dorset, UK), and 1% antibiotic/antimycototic mixture (100×, Gibco) and incubated overnight
at 37 ˚C and 5% CO2 as described [5,11]. The following day, HFs that had macroscopically
remained in anagen VI had media replaced with the following additions:
CsA.
HFs were cultured with 500 μL of CsA at 10−7 M (Cat no. #9973S, Cell Signalling
Technology, Beverly, MA) or vehicle control. CsA solutions (both stock [10−3M] and working
[10−7M]) and vehicle controls were made as previously described [4]. For microarray analysis,
HFs were incubated for 6 hours with CsA, while immunofluorescent, ISH, and qRT-PCR vali-
dation occurred at 48 hours incubation.
WAY-316606.
HFs were cultured with 500 μL of WAY-316606 at 2 μM (Cat no. A3932,
ApexBio; Houston, TX) or vehicle control (0.02% DMSO). A stock solution of WAY-316606
was made at a 10 mM concentration by adding 2,229.8 μL of DMSO (Sigma) to 10 mg of
WAY-316606. This was subsequently diluted in serum-free HF media (4 μL of WAY-316606
10 mM in 19,996 μL HF media) for a working 2 μM concentration. For qRT-PCR analysis,
HFs were incubated with WAY-316606 for 24 hours. To analyse β-catenin activity (ISH
[AXIN2 mRNA] and immunofluorescent analysis [nuclear β-catenin]), HFs were incubated
for 48 hours with WAY-316606. For hair cycle analysis, HFs were incubated with WAY-
316606 up to 6 days.
Carrier-free rhSFRP1. HFs were cultured with 1 mL carrier-free rhSFRP1 at 10 μg/mL
(Cat No. 5396-SF-025, R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN) or vehicle control (PBS). A stock
solution of rhSFRP1 was made at 250 μg/mL by adding 100 μL of PBS (Gibco) to 25 μg of
rhSFRP1. This was subsequently diluted in serum-free HF media (40 μL of rhSFRP1 [250 μg/
mL] in 960 μL HF media) for a working concentration of 10 μg/mL. For qRT-PCR analysis,
HFs were incubated with rhSFRP1 for 48 hours.
CsA and rhSFRP1 rescue experiment.
Stock solutions were made as described above and
subsequently diluted further to the following final solutions: vehicle control (960 μL of CsA
vehicle [containing ethanol, TWEEN-80 in serum-free HF media] and 40 μL of PBS), rhSFRP1
at 10 μg/mL (960 μL of CsA vehicle [containing ethanol, TWEEN-80 in serum-free HF media]
and 40 μL rhSFRP1), CsA at 10−7 M with rhSFRP1 at 10 μg/mL (960 μL of CsA [containing
ethanol, TWEEN-80 in serum-free HF media] and 40 μL rhSFRP1). HFs were then cultured in
500 μL of corresponding solution per well. For hair cycle analysis, HFs were incubated with
vehicle control, rhSFRP1 alone, or rhSFRP1 with CsA up to 6 days.
IWP-2.
HFs were cultured with 500 μL of IWP-2 at 5 μM (Cat No. 04–0034, Stemgent;
Lexington, MA) or vehicle control (0.1% DMSO). A stock solution of IWP-2 was made at 5
mM concentration by diluting 857.3 μL of DMSO to 2 mg of IWP-2. This was subsequently
diluted in serum-free HF media (10 μL of IWP-2 [5 mM] in 9,990 μL of HF media) for a work-
ing concentration of 5 μM. For qRT-PCR analysis, HFs were incubated with IWP-2 for 48
hours.
For 6-day HF organ culture, media was changed every other day and HF images for mea-
suring hair shaft elongation were taken with a Leica EC3 camera (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).
Macroscopic quantification of HF stages were carried out as previously described [11,15,37].
On day 6 following WAY-316606 treatment, studies were terminated with HFs being embed-
ded in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT [Thermo-scientific, Leicestershire, UK])
and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80 ˚C prior to subsequent use. For

 qRT-PCR studies, HFs were harvested and stored in 1 mL of RNAlater (Ambion, Paisley, UK)
at 4 ˚C until required.
Quantitative immunohistomorphometry
Frozen sections from microdissected fresh, 2-, and 6-day cultured HFs were made using a
cryostat (OTF5000, Bright, London, UK) at 6 μm. Masson-Fontana staining and Ki-67/
TUNEL dual immunofluorescence and histomorphometric analysis was carried out as previ-
ously described [15]. Masson-Fontana, Ki-67/TUNEL, SFRP1, and K85 staining were imaged
using Biozero 8000 Keyence microscope (Biozero, Osaka, Japan) for image analysis. β-catenin
was imaged using the Olympus BX53 upright microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Represen-
tative images for ISH were imaged using Olympus BX53 upright microscope. ImageJ was used
to quantify immunofluorescent intensity and ISH signal. For some representative images, the
contrast was changed globally within CorelDraw or PowerPoint, and matching settings were
applied to both test and control.
SFRP1 and β-catenin immunofluorescence
Frozen HF sections were fixed in 4% PFA for 20 minutes at 4 ˚C, then washed with Tris-buff-
ered saline (TBS [all wash steps used TBS]). Tissue was then permeabilised with 0.5% Triton
X-100 (in TBS) for 10 minutes. Sections were washed and incubated with 10% normal goat
serum (NGS [in TBS]) for 30 minutes. Next, sections were incubated with either SFRP1 (1:200
in 10% NGS; abcam Cat No. ab4193) or β-catenin (1:200 in 10% NGS; BD Transduction Labo-
ratories Cat No. 610154) primary antibodies overnight (4 ˚C). The following day, sections
were washed and incubated with AF-488 (1:200 in TBS; Invitrogen Cat No. A11008) or AF-
594 (1:200 in TBS; Invitrogen Cat No. A11032) secondary antibodies (1 hour at room tempera-
ture). Sections were then washed and nuclei were counterstained by using DAPI (1 μg/mL in
PBS) for 1 minute. For negative controls, primary antibody raised against SFRP1 and β-catenin
were omitted. Frozen human testis was used as a positive control for SFRP1 [38] (S2J and S2K
Fig), as well as analysing the differential pattern of SFRP1 mRNA and protein throughout the
human HF (S3 Fig).
K85 immunofluorescence
K85 immunofluorescence was performed on microdissected HFs as per SFRP1 and β-catenin,
except that samples were fixed with acetone (10 minutes at −20 ˚C); no permeabilisation was
required and phosphate buffered saline was used for washes. A primary K85 antibody (gift
from Dr. Lutz Langbein, Heidelberg, Germany) was used at 1:1,000 concentration (in 2%
NGS) and secondary antibody goat anti–guinea pig AF-488 (Invitrogen Cat No. A11073)
1:200 concentration (in 2% NGS). For negative controls, primary antibody raised against K85
was omitted.
RNA ISH
OCT-embedded HFs were sectioned at 6 μm, dried at −20 ˚C for 1 hour, and then stored at
−80 ˚C for subsequent use. Sections were then processed for RNA in situ detection using the
RNAscope 2.5 HD Reagent Kit-Red (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Milan, Italy) following man-
ufacturer’s instructions. The following probes were used: SFRP1 (NM_003012.4, target 401–
1971), AXIN2 (NM_004655.3, target 502–1674), LEF1 (NM_001166119.1_ target 793–1919),
WLS (NM_001193334.1, target 355–1325), WNT1 (NM_005430.3_target 390–1863), WNT2
(NR_024047.1, target 1324–2598), WNT3 (NM_030753.4, target 1014–1945), WNT3A

 (NM_033131.3, target 1212–2328), WNT4 (NM_030761.4, target 132–1770), WNT10A
(NM_025216.2, target 658–1949), WNT10B (NM_003394.3, target 865–2282), PPIB as a posi-
tive control (NM_000942.4, region 139–989), DapB as a negative control (EF191515, target
414–862). Quantification of ISH was carried out as previously described [39].
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from 5 full-length HFs for each condition using the RNAeasy mini
kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) according to manufacturer’s protocol and guidelines. One hun-
dred nanograms of RNA were converted to cDNA using Tetro cDNA synthesis kit (Bioline,
London, UK) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative PCR was performed in tripli-
cate using Taqman probes (Life Technologies, Taqman assay ID: SFRP1: Hs00610060_m1,
AXIN2: Hs01063170_m1, LEF1: Hs01547250_m1, GAPDH: Hs02758991_g1). Reactions were
performed and analysed using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system and associated soft-
ware (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, UK). Relative expression was calculated using the ΔCT
method against the housekeeping gene, GAPDH.
Microarray
Human HFs were treated for 6 hours with CsA (10−7M) and total RNA was extracted using
RNAeasy mini kit. Extracted RNA was taken to the Genomic Core Facilities at the University
of Manchester and run onto Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip. Data were deposited in
NCBI Geo (GSE109632).
Bioinformatics analysis
Technical quality control and outlier analysis were performed with dChip (V2005) using the
default settings. Background correction, quantile normalisation, and gene expression analysis
were performed using RMA in Bioconductor. To establish relationships and compare variabil-
ity between samples, principal components analysis (PCA) was used, because this method is
able to reduce the effective dimensionality of complex gene-expression space without signifi-
cant loss of information. Differential expression analysis was performed with Limma using a
paired test and functions lmFit and eBayes. Gene lists of differentially expressed genes were
controlled for false discovery rate (fdr) errors using the method of QVALUE.
Ingenuity pathway analysis
The microarray data set was uploaded to ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and filtered with a
p-value of 0.05 and examined through core pathway analysis.
Statistics
All experiments used HFs from at least three individual male patient samples, unless stated
otherwise.
Results were first checked for normal distribution using D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus nor-
mality test and equal variance using F-test. Then, depending on these results, statistical analysis
was performed with suitable t tests, either parametric (unpaired t test) or nonparametric tests
(unpaired Mann-Whitney test). For experiments with more than one group, unpaired one-
way ANOVA was chosen for normally distributed data with Tukey test to correct for multiple
comparisons, while unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test was selected for nonparametric data with
Dunn’s test to correct for multiple comparisons. For qRT-PCR analysis, one-sample t test was
