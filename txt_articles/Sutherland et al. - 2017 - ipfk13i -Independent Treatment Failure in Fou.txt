ABSTRACT We present case histories of four patients treated with artemether-
lumefantrine for falciparum malaria in UK hospitals in 2015 to 2016. Each subse-
quently presented with recurrent symptoms and Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia
within 6 weeks of treatment with no intervening travel to countries where malaria is
endemic. Parasite isolates, all of African origin, harbored variants at some candidate
resistance loci. No evidence of pfk13-mediated artemisinin resistance was found. Vig-
ilance for signs of unsatisfactory antimalarial efficacy among imported cases of ma-
laria is recommended.
KEYWORDS imported malaria, treatment failure, parasite genotyping, antimalarial
agents, drug resistance mechanisms
T
reatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria has benefited from the availability of
artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) (1). In Asia, reduced artemisinin
susceptibility mediated by specific mutations in the parasite pfk13 locus may indicate
a threat to ACT efficacy (2, 3). However, these specific pfk13 variants have not been seen
in Africa (2–4), where variable ACT efficacy appears to be independent of pfk13
polymorphism but may be linked to multilocus genotypes encompassing pfcrt, pfmdr1,
pfap2mu, and pfubp1 (5–9).
Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is the recommended treatment for imported cases of
falciparum malaria in the UK (1) and is the most widely used ACT in Africa, the origin
of most UK infections (10). Between October 2015 and February 2016, four cases of
recurrent P. falciparum malaria in AL-treated patients occurring 17 to 43 days after the
original episode were reported to the Malaria Reference Laboratory (MRL) (Table 1) by
two UK hospitals. Brief case reports and genotyping of parasites isolated from both
episodes in each patient are presented.
This work was undertaken under the statutory remit of the MRL set out by the UK
Department of Health, which explicitly requires surveillance for evidence of emerging
drug resistance among UK malaria cases, as previously described (10). All tests per-
formed were formally requested by physicians directly responsible for patient care. All

aParasites from the second malaria episode of patient 2 were successfully established in in vitro culture for estimation of drug susceptibility.
bThe nomenclature used shows the wild-type (WT) (reference) amino acid encoded at the codon of interest, followed by the amino acid encoded by the observed variant. Mutations in the pfk13 locus previously associated
with reduced susceptibility to artemisinin in vitro and in vivo in the Mekong region occur between codon 440 and the 3= end of the coding region.
cThe nomenclature used shows the single-letter amino acid code for codons 72 to 76, strongly associated with chloroquine resistance. The CVMNK haplotype has been associated with AL treatment failures in Kenya (5).
dThe single mutation Tyr to Phe at codon 184 identifies the NFD genotype at codons 86, 184, and 1246 in the pfmdr1 locus, previously associated with AL failure in Tanzania and Kenya (5, 8).

fWhole-genome sequencing results for both parasite isolates from patient 3. In the primary episode, heterozygosity (variant allele frequencies of between 5% and 95% of total reads) was seen in over 4,000 loci. About
50% of reads at informative positions comprised variants also present in the monoclonal recrudescent episode (17 days later).

 patient identifiers were removed from the data prior to extraction from the Public
Health England (PHE) MRL database. Other than those required for the primary diag-
nosis of malaria, no additional blood samples were taken from patients. Patient 2 gave
written informed consent for culture adaption of parasites from her blood samples,
under UK National Research Ethics Service Approval 07/Q0505/60, granted to C. J.
Sutherland.
Patient 1. A male over 65 years of age presented to Addenbrooke’
s Hospital,
Cambridge University Hospital (CUH), UK, in 2015 with 1.4% P. falciparum parasitemia
following travel in Angola. He was treated with AL in the hospital, and all doses were
observed. The first dose was consumed without food, and the patient vomited once 3
h later. All but one of the subsequent AL doses were consumed with food, and the
patient was confirmed negative for parasitemia prior to discharge. Symptoms recurred
more than 1 month later, and the patient presented with 0.02% P. falciparum para-
sitemia, confirmed by PCR and microscopy at the MRL. The patient responded well to
administration of 4 tablets of 100/250 mg atovaquone/proguanil daily for 3 days. The
pfmdr1 Tyr184Phe and pfap2mu Ser160Asn variants observed have both been associ-
ated with recurrent parasitemia in AL-treated African patients (5, 8).
Patient 2. A Ugandan female under 21 years of age was admitted to the Hospital
for Tropical Diseases, London (HTD), with acute P. falciparum hyperparasitemia esti-
mated at more than 30% in early 2016 following a visit to Uganda. She responded well
to initial treatment with intravenous (i.v.) artesunate. Parasitemia of 0.07% was re-
corded 60 h after admission, and the patient was discharged 3 days later, with a
recorded parasitemia level of 0.0001%, on a full course of oral AL. Full compliance was
reported under supervision of staff members at her place of learning. Symptoms
recurred 4 weeks later. The patient was readmitted to HTD with 2.7% P. falciparum
parasitemia, received 2 days i.v. artesunate as an inpatient until the parasitemia level
fell below 0.0001%, and was discharged on a full course of AL plus 7 days of doxycycline
(200 mg daily). This recurrent isolate was established in in vitro culture at the London
School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), and standard 48-h 50% effective
concentration (EC50) estimates were derived for chloroquine (102.6 nM), dihydroarte-
misinin (2.8 nM), and lumefantrine (38.7 nM) as previously described (11), with the
results indicating full sensitivity to AL components in vitro. The genotypes of both
parasite isolates were consistent with AL sensitivity at pfk13, pfcrt, pfmdr1, and pfap2mu
(Table 1). However, the Glu-to-Gln change at codon 1525 of pfubp1 was associated
with reduced susceptibility to ACT in vivo in one study (8). The recurrent parasitemia
occurring 28 days after first presentation may reflect incomplete clearance of the
original hyperparasitemia by the treatment received.
Patient 3. A male over 21 years of age presented to CUH with 0.4% P. falciparum
parasitemia in early 2016, after travel to Liberia. He was treated with AL and was
eventually discharged but returned with recurrent symptoms and 0.02% parasitemia 17
days later. He was successfully treated with atovaquone-proguanil. Genotyping iden-
tified mixed genotypes at both pfcrt and pfap2mu loci in the isolate from the primary
episode but not in that from the recurrent episode (Table 1). DNA extracted from
the patient after both episodes was sent to the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute for
whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Preliminary analysis strongly suggests that the
recurrent infection which occurred 17 days after AL treatment comprised a single
parasite clone, whereas the original parasite population was multiclonal (Table 1).
The recurrent isolate harbored the previously identified CVMNK and NFD haplotypes of
pfcrt and pfmdr1, known to be selected in parasites persisting after AL treatment (5, 8).
The impact of the ins_Lys233 variant of pfap2mu and that of the novel pfk13 non-
propeller region mutation Gly112Glu require further study. Analysis in the bioanalytical
laboratory of LSHTM confirmed that the AL tablets used to treat this patient (Novartis
Riamet [lot XO131; expiration date, December 2017]) met the specified International
Pharmacopeia tolerance limits (12).

 Patient 4. A female under 21 years of age who presented as febrile to the HTD in
early 2016 following travel to Uganda was diagnosed with 0.08% P. falciparum para-
sitemia and treated with oral AL. The patient was discharged to complete the treatment
course at home and reported full compliance with all six doses. She experienced
recurrent symptoms 1 month later, presenting to HTD with confirmed 0.3% P. falcip-
arum parasitemia, and was successfully treated with 7 days of oral quinine (10 mg/kg
of body weight every 8 h) and doxycycline (200 mg daily). Data from the two episodes
appeared identical at the parasite loci evaluated. Novel mutations at codons 226 and
326 of pfap2mu and codon 1500 of pfubp1 are of unknown significance, but, as this is
clearly a recrudescent parasite genotype, both variants should be further evaluated in
future studies.
Treatment failure cannot be unequivocally ascribed to parasite resistance in these four
patients, although three harbored parasites with variant alleles of loci previously linked to
reduced susceptibility to artemisinin or lumefantrine (Table 1). Our findings would have
been strengthened by observing treatment for all patients to ensure full regimen compli-
ance, and by measurement of lumefantrine blood levels at day 7, to rule out any problems
with malabsorption (1), as this can result in failure to clear parasites (13). None of the four
patients harbored mutations in the propeller-encoding domain of the pfk13 locus and thus
did not exhibit reduced artemisinin susceptibility as seen in the Greater Mekong Region
(2–4). The parasites that we describe may represent adaptive African genotypes that have
evolved pfk13-independent mechanisms for posttreatment survival in vivo. This suggests
that, in countries where malaria is not endemic and in which imported malaria cases from
Africa are seen, vigilance is required to protect the efficacy of our first-line ACT. Studies in
countries where malaria is endemic are required to further validate potential genetic
markers for monitoring in African parasite populations.
Artemisinins are very quickly metabolized and cleared from circulation, such that
only a single full parasite life cycle is exposed to the highly potent action of these
compounds under conditions of a 3-day regimen. The current practice of 3 days of
treatment may therefore be insufficient to guarantee clearance of parasite genotypes
under ACT pressure for a decade in many parts of Africa (14). The use of two sequential
rounds of ACT, such as AL followed by 3 days of either artesunate-amodiaquine or
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, would provide 6 days of treatment with artemisinin
with two longer-half-life partner drugs (14, 15). This approach should also be consid-
ered a potential strategy should increasing numbers of treatment failures be observed
after administration of standard ACT regimens for imported malaria cases in countries
where malaria is not endemic. In the majority of cases, ACT retains its efficacy against
P. falciparum of African origin, but the cases presented here suggest that this favorable
situation may deteriorate in the future.
