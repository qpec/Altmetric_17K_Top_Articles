Abstract
Background—Lower leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and higher body mass index (BMI) 
are independently associated with risk of heart failure (HF). However, it is unclear if this 
relationship is consistent for both HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with 
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
Objective—This study sought to quantify dose-response associations between LTPA, BMI, and 
the risk of different HF subtypes.
Methods—Individual-level data from 3 cohort studies (WHI, MESA, and CHS) were pooled and 
participants were stratified into guideline-recommended categories of LTPA and BMI. 
Associations between LTPA, BMI, and risk of overall HF, HFpEF (ejection fraction [EF] ≥45%) 
and HFrEF (EF <45%) were assessed used multivariable adjusted Cox models and restricted cubic 
splines.
Results—The study included 51,451 participants with 3,180 HF events (1,252 HFpEF, 914 
HFrEF, 1,014 missing EF). In adjusted analysis, there was a dose-dependent association between 
higher LTPA levels, lower BMI, and overall HF risk. Among HF subtypes, LTPA in any dose 
range was not associated with HFrEF risk. In contrast, lower levels of LTPA (<500 metabolic 
equivalents of task [MET]-min/week) were not associated with HFpEF risk, and dose-dependent

 associations with lower HFpEF risk were observed at higher levels. Compared with no LTPA, 
higher than twice the guideline-recommended minimum LTPA levels (>1,000 MET-min/week) 
were associated with an 19% lower risk of HFpEF (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.97). The dose-
response relationship for BMI with HFpEF risk was also more consistent than with HFrEF risk, 
such that increasing BMI above the normal range (≥ 25 kg/m2) was associated with greater 
increase in risk of HFpEF than HFrEF.
Conclusion—Our study findings demonstrate strong, dose-dependent associations between 
LTPA levels, BMI, and risk of overall HF. Among HF subtypes, higher LTPA levels and lower 
BMI were more consistently associated with lower risk of HFpEF compared with HFrEF.
Keywords
body mass index; dose response relationship; heart failure; physical activity
Heart failure (HF) affects approximately 5.8 million people and accounts for an estimated 
annual health care cost of $34.8 billion (1). Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction 
(HFpEF) represents a common phenotype that accounts for up to 50% of HF cases and is 
associated with poor outcomes, similar to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) (2–4). In contrast to HFrEF, in large randomized trials, several pharmacological 
therapies have failed to improve clinical outcomes among patients with HFpEF (5–7). 
Because HFpEF continues to be refractory to available therapies, the focus on primary 
prevention is a critical part of strategies to control the growing burden of this disease at the 
population level.
An important step in HFpEF prevention is to identify modifiable risk factors that can be 
targeted with effective preventive strategies. Lifestyle risk factors, such as physical inactivity 
and obesity, play an important role in development of HF (8–11). Specifically, in a recent 
meta-analysis, we observed a linear dose-dependent inverse relationship between leisure 
time physical activity (LTPA) levels and HF risk; higher levels of LTPA, in excess of the 
guideline-recommended minimum doses, were associated with lower risk of HF (12). 
Similarly, a strong dose-dependent association has been reported between higher body mass 
index (BMI) levels, above the normal range, and risk of HF (13). However, it is unclear if 
this dose-response relationship is consistent for both HFpEF and HFrEF. Thus, the 
contribution of different doses of LTPA and levels of BMI to different HF subtypes is not 
known, and therefore, the optimal target goals that should be achieved for HFpEF prevention 
remain undefined.
The goal of the present study was to characterize the dose-response relationship between 
LTPA levels, BMI, and risk of HFpEF and HFrEF using individual-level pooled data from 3 
well-characterized prospective cohort studies. On the basis of our previous research showing 
the unique contributions of low fitness and physical inactivity to diastolic dysfunction and 
concentric hypertrophy, which are the key intermediate phenotypes in HFpEF development 
(14), we hypothesized that there would be a stronger inverse dose-response relationship 
between LTPA and HFpEF compared with HFrEF, such that increasing levels of physical 
activity (PA) would be associated with greater reduction in risk of HFpEF, as compared with 
HFrEF. Furthermore, on the basis of prior observations of significant positive associations

 between BMI and diastolic dysfunction, we also hypothesized that increasing BMI would be 
more strongly associated with risk of HFpEF versus risk of HFrEF (15, 16).
METHODS
Individual-level data was pooled from 3 large prospective cohort studies that reported 
quantitative measures of LTPA and BMI at baseline and had HFpEF and HFrEF outcome 
adjudication on follow-up. These included the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), the 
Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). 
These 3 observational cohort studies are well established, and descriptions of their design 
characteristics and HF outcomes were previously published (17–19).
Briefly, CHS is an ongoing, prospective, community-based observational study of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in older adults. CHS participants included 5,888 
community-dwelling older adults recruited from a random sample of Medicare-eligible older 
adults in 2 phases, between 1989 and 1990 and between 1992 and 1993, across 4 distinct 
U.S. communities. MESA is an ongoing, prospective, community-based observational study 
of CVD risk in multiple ethnicities that included 6,814 participants free of baseline CVD, 45 
to 84 years of age, from 6 distinct U.S. communities. WHI is an ongoing observational 
cohort study of the occurrence and determinants of disease, including CVD, in U.S. post-
menopausal women. A subset of this cohort that included participants randomized to the 
Hormone Trials and all black and Hispanic participants had central adjudication of HF 
outcome events and HF subtypes on follow-up (WHI-HF cohort, n = 46,563)(20). The 
present study included all participants from the 3 cohorts who, at baseline, were without 
known prevalent HF or myocardial infarction, had quantitative measures of LTPA and BMI, 
and underwent cardiovascular (CV) outcome adjudication on follow-up (Figure 1). The 
study excluded individuals who developed HF within 2 years of baseline LTPA assessment, 
to account for reverse causation for subclinical disease at baseline. Individuals with incident 
HF on follow-up, but missing information on ejection fraction (EF) were excluded from the 
HF subtype analysis evaluating associations for LTPA and BMI with risks of HFpEF and 
HFrEF. De-identified participant-level data was obtained from each of the 3 cohort studies 
after the study protocol was approved by the Institute Review Board at the University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas and the coordinating centers for each of 
the 3 cohorts.
STUDY MEASURES: EXPOSURE VARIABLES
Measurement of baseline covariates
In all 3 cohorts, participants underwent comprehensive baseline examinations that included 
both self-reported and measured baseline risk factors. Details of these prior measurements 
for each cohort were reported previously (17, 21, 22). Baseline characteristics of interest 
included in the present analysis were age, sex, ethnicity, annual income, education level, 
BMI, baseline blood pressure, history of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and LTPA levels. 
BMI was calculated at the time of the baseline visit in each of the 3 cohorts as the ratio of 
weight to height squared (kg/m2). For the present study, BMI was categorized into 
clinically-meaningful categories, as defined by the National Institutes of Health (<18.5

 kg/m2; 18.5 to <25 kg/m2; 25 to <30 kg/m2; 30 to <35 kg/m2; and ≥35 kg/m2 for the 
underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese class I, and obese class II/III categories, 
respectively) (23). For other baseline characteristics of interest that were reported differently 
across the 3 cohorts, standardized categories were used to harmonize data across the cohorts 
as follows: race/ethnicity (black, white, Hispanics, others); annual income (<$50,000/year, 
≥50,000/year); education status (< high school, high school, some college, college +); 
smoking status (nonsmokers, current smoker, and former smoker); current alcohol use (yes 
vs. no).
LTPA measurement
Self-reported LTPA was measured at baseline in the included studies using well-validated 
PA questionnaires, as previously reported (24–29). In WHI, LTPA at baseline was assessed 
using a self-administered questionnaire which queried on usual frequency (days/week) and 
duration (20-min increments) of walking outside the home, as well as mild, moderate, and 
strenuous LTPA (30). Each type of activity was assigned a metabolic equivalent task (MET) 
intensity score on the basis of its energy cost (31), and PA-related energy expenditure (MET-
min/week) was computed as the summed product of frequency, duration, and intensity. In 
CHS, baseline LTPA was assessed using a modified Minnesota Leisure-Time Activities 
questionnaire, which evaluated the frequency and duration of 15 different activities during a 
2-week period and was used to estimate per week energy expenditure in kilocalories. MET-
min/week of LTPA was calculated for CHS participants as follows: total MET-min/week = 
total kcal per week/(body weight [kg] X 0.0175) (27). In MESA, the Typical Week Physical 
Activity Survey (adapted from the Cross-Cultural Activity Participation Study (28)) was 
used to record frequency and duration (per session) of various types and intensities of PA in 
a typical week at baseline. Minutes of activity were summed for each discrete activity type 
and multiplied by activity-specific MET levels to determine the total MET-min/week of PA 
(29, 32). For the present study, the summary variable for total intentional exercise, which 
focused on the areas of PA recommended by the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services guidelines, was used to determine LTPA levels among the MESA study 
participants. Examples of different types and intensities of PA (assessed in each of the 3 
cohorts) are detailed in the Online Methods.
Although PA ascertainment occurred differently in each of 3 cohorts, summary quantitative 
estimates of MET-min/week of LTPA calculated for participants of each cohort are 
comparable, are derived using standardized MET values to account for intensities as a part 
of PA volume, and were used in previously reported analyses (29, 30, 32–35).
Study measures: outcomes of interest
Primary outcomes of interest in this study were incidence of overall HF and its subtypes, 
HFpEF and HFrEF. In each of the 3 cohort studies, an expert committee of physicians 
adjudicated HF incidence on follow-up. In the original WHI cohort, HF events were 
adjudicated locally or centrally by reviewing medical records for evidence of physician-
diagnosed HF. In the subset of the WHI-HF cohort that was included in the present pooled 
analysis, all self-reported and locally or centrally confirmed HF cases were re-adjudicated at 
the University of North Carolina. In MESA, criteria for adjudicating HF events were adapted

 from the WHI (20). In CHS, incident HF was ascertained by participant interview at 
semiannual study visits, medial record review, and examination of Medicare claims data, and 
confirmed by an expert adjudication panel. The detailed clinical criteria used to identify HF 
events in each of the 3 cohorts are described in the Online Methods. Adjudication of HF 
subtype (HFpEF vs. HFrEF) in each of the 3 cohorts (WHI-HF, MESA, CHS) was on the 
basis of measured EF at time of HF diagnosis, as determined by echocardiography or other 
cardiac imaging using the same cutoff of 45% (EF ≥45% vs. <45% for HFpEF and HFrEF, 
respectively) (36–39).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Individual-level participant data was merged from the 3 cohorts and the pooled study 
participants were stratified on the basis of their LTPA levels as follows: 1) no LTPA; 2) less 
than minimum guideline-recommended LTPA (1– <500 MET-min/week); 3) guideline-
recommended LTPA (500–1,000 MET-min/week); 4) more than guideline-recommended 
LTPA (>1,000 MET-min/week) (40). Participant baseline characteristics were compared 
across the 4 LTPA categories using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test for continuous variables and 
the Cochran-Armitage trend test for categorical variables. Unadjusted cumulative incidence 
of HF outcomes across different LPTA and BMI categories were assessed and compared 
using Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests. To understand the biological relationship 
between lifestyle factors and risk of HF outcomes independent of other traditional risk 
factors, multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were constructed with 
LTPA and BMI categories as exposure variables and HF outcomes (overall HF, HFpEF, 
HFrEF) as dependent outcomes of interest. Separate Cox models were constructed for each 
HF outcome with adjustment for following covariates: Model 1: age; sex; ethnicity; 
education level; income; BMI; LTPA; and study cohort; Model 2: variables in Model 1 plus 
history of diabetes; history of hypertension; systolic blood pressure; smoking status; and 
current alcohol use. The relevant covariates for these Cox models were chosen on the basis 
of our prior knowledge from published reports about biological factors that may influence 
the relationship between lifestyle factors and risk of HF. Death was treated as a censoring 
event for all adjusted analysis. For HF subtype outcome analysis, unclassified incident HF 
cases were excluded, and the other HF subtype was treated as an additional censoring event. 
Hazard ratios (HRs) associated with different LTPA and BMI levels were compared by using 
linear contrast analysis to test the dose-response effect for each HF subtype outcome.
Continuous dose-response relationships between LTPA levels (MET-min/week), BMI (kg/
m2), and risk of HFpEF and HFrEF were also assessed using adjusted Cox models and 
restricted cubic splines. Interaction testing was performed in the most adjusted Cox modes 
to determine if the associations of LTPA and BMI levels with HF outcomes varied across 
different baseline characteristics, such as sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic indexes 
(education level and annual income) for different HF outcomes using the likelihood ratio 
test. The variables for interaction testing were chosen on the basis of previously published 
reports on the impact of different demographic characteristics on the relationship between 
lifestyle factors and risk of HF (9, 20, 39).

 To account for the differences in study cohort, cohort-stratified pooled analysis was 
performed, evaluating the risk for HF outcomes associated with different LTPA and BMI 
levels. For this, separate multivariable adjusted Cox models (similar to Model 2 of the 
primary analysis) were constructed for each cohort to determine the risk of different HF 
outcomes associated with different LTPA and BMI categories. Cohort-specific HRs for 
different HF outcomes associated with each LTPA and BMI category were then pooled using 
the random effects modeling technique, as described by Dersimonian and Laird (41).
Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the adjusted associations between LTPA, 
BMI, and risk of HF with missing EF data by constructing multivariable adjusted Cox 
models as detailed previously (Model 2). Adjusted associations between waist-hip 
circumference ratio (WHR), a measure of central adiposity, and risk of HF outcomes were 
also evaluated using multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis.
Data analysis was performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North 
Carolina) and STATA 10.0 (STATA Corp, College Station, Texas). All statistical tests 
performed in this study were 2-sided, and a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS
The present study included 51,451 participants (77.2% from WHI, 13.1% from MESA, 
9.7% from CHS) (Figure 1). The baseline characteristics of the study participants stratified 
by their LTPA levels are compared in Table 1. Participants with higher levels of LTPA were 
more commonly men, white, and had higher annual income and education levels. 
Furthermore, the prevalence of traditional CV risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, smoking, and obesity, was significantly lower with higher levels of LTPA. Baseline 
characteristics of study participants are also compared across different BMI categories in 
Online Table 1. Participants in the higher BMI groups were younger, had lower levels of 
LTPA, and had higher prevalence of CV risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension.
After 645,515 person-years of follow-up, 3,180 incident HF events were observed, of which 
39.4% were HFpEF (n = 1,252), 28.7% were HFrEF (n = 914), and 31.9% were unclassified 
HF (n = 1,014). Baseline characteristics of the study participants and the follow-up HF 
events across the individual study cohorts are compared in Online Table 2. The WHI cohort 
contributed 44.8% of the incident HF events observed in our pooled analysis, whereas CHS 
and MESA contributed 48.1% and 7.1% of HF events, respectively.
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN LTPA LEVELS AND RISK OF OVERALL HF, HFpEF, AND HFrEF
A consistent, dose-dependent, inverse association was observed between higher LTPA levels 
and risk of overall HF in both the multivariable adjusted models (Table 2). Compared with 
no LTPA, low levels of LTPA at less than the guideline-recommended dose (<500 MET-min/
week) were associated with a modest, statistically insignificant 6% lower HF risk. The 
magnitude of inverse association between LTPA and HF risk was stronger at higher levels of 
LTPA, with 11% and 22% lower HF risk at guideline-recommended (500 to 1,000 MET-
min/week) and greater than guideline-recommended (>1,000 MET-min/week) doses,

 respectively (Table 2, Model 2). Similar findings were also observed in continuous analysis, 
such that a 1 SD higher LTPA was associated with an 8% lower risk of HF.
Among HF subtypes, in unadjusted comparisons, the cumulative incidence of HFpEF was 
significantly lower across higher LTPA categories (plog-rank = 0.04) (Figure 2A). In contrast, 
the association between higher levels of LTPA and cumulative risk of HFrEF was modest 
and not statistically significant (plog-rank = 0.167) (Figure 2B). In adjusted analysis, higher 
LTPA was not associated with risk of HFrEF at any dose range in both multivariable 
adjusted models (Table 2, Models 1 and 2). In contrast, a significant graded association was 
observed between higher LTPA levels and risk of HFpEF after adjustment for baseline 
demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status (Table 2, Model 1). The relationship 
was slightly attenuated with further adjustment for traditional CV risk factors but stayed 
significant at higher levels of LTPA above the guideline-recommended dose (Table 2, Model 
2). LTPA at levels above 1,000 MET-min/week was associated with 19% lower risk of 
HFpEF in the most adjusted model. In linear contrast analysis comparing the HRs associated 
with different LTPA levels for each HF subtype, a significant dose-dependent association 
was observed between LTPA levels and risk of HFpEF (p trend for HR = 0.006) but not 
HFrEF (p trend for HR = 0.182).
In continuous analysis using restricted cubic splines, the association between LTPA and 
HFrEF risk was not significant (adjusted HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.02) and did not 
change with increasing LTPA levels (Figure 3, top panel). In contrast, a dose-dependent 
inverse association was observed between LTPA levels and HFpEF risk (adjusted HR: 0.91; 
95% CI: 0.85 to 0.97), with a more linear dose-response relationship observed above the 
guideline-recommended doses of LTPA (Figure 3, bottom panel). No significant statistical 
interaction was observed between LTPA levels and sex, ethnicity, education status, or 
income for the risk of overall HF or HF subtypes (pinteraction > 0.2 for all).
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BMI AND RISK OF OVERALL HF, HFpEF, AND HFrEF
Compared with participants with normal BMI, those with higher BMI were associated with 
a graded dose-dependent association with overall HF risk (Table 3). Among HF subtypes, in 
unadjusted comparisons, the cumulative incidence of HFpEF was significantly higher across 
higher BMI categories above the normal range (Figure 2C, p log-rank < 0.0001). In contrast, 
the cumulative incidence of HFrEF across higher BMI categories was not significantly 
different (Figure 2D, p log-rank = 0.154). Similar findings were also observed in adjusted 
analysis, such that risk of HFrEF was not significantly different among overweight and 
obese Class I participants compared with normal weight participants after adjustment for 
potential confounders, including demographic characteristics and prevalent CV risk factors 
(Table 3, Model 2). In contrast, there was a significant, dose-dependent association between 
BMI and HFpEF risk, such that compared with normal weight participants, overweight and 
obese class I participants had statistically significant 38% and 56% higher risks of HFpEF, 
respectively. Extremely obese participants with BMI ≥35 kg/m2 had the highest risk for both 
HFpEF and HFrEF (Table 3, Model 2). In linear contrast analysis comparing the HRs 
associated with different BMI levels for each HF subtype, a significant dose-dependent

 association was observed between BMI and risk of HFpEF (p trend for HR < 0.0001), but 
not HFrEF (p trend for HR = 0.07).
Similar findings were also observed in the continuous analysis using restricted cubic splines 
with a consistent dose-dependent association between BMI and risk of HFpEF, but not 
HFrEF (Figure 4). No significant statistical interaction was observed between BMI and 
ethnicity for the risk of overall HF (pinteraction = 0.17), HFpEF (pinteraction = 0.29), or HFrEF 
(pinteraction = 0.90). There was a modest, statistically insignificant interaction between BMI 
and sex for HFrEF (pinteraction = 0.06). No interaction was observed between BMI and sex 
for HFpEF (pinteraction = 0.92) or overall HF risk (pinteraction = 0.30).
Associations between LTPA levels, BMI, and risk of different HF outcomes in cohort-
stratified analysis with pooling of adjusted HRs from each cohort were consistent with that 
observed in the primary analysis (Online Table 3).
Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the association between WHR, a measure 
of central adiposity, and risk of HF outcomes. In adjusted analysis, a significant association 
between WHR and risk of overall HF, HFpEF, and HFrEF was observed, independent of 
other risk factors (Online Table 4). Sensitivity analysis was also performed to evaluate the 
association between LTPA, BMI, and risk of HF with missing EF. Overall, the pattern of 
associations for HF with missing EF was more like that observed for HFpEF than HFrEF. 
LPTA was significantly associated with lower risk of HF with missing EF at high levels, in 
excess of twice the guideline-recommended doses. Furthermore, a dose-dependent 
association was observed between higher BMI above the normal range and risk of HF with 
missing EF, independent of other risk factors (Online Table 5).
DISCUSSION
In this large, individual-level pooled analysis, a consistent, graded, dose-response 
association was observed between LTPA, BMI, and risk of overall HF. Furthermore, the 
dose-response relationship between LTPA and HFrEF risk was different from that for 
HFpEF risk. LTPA was not significantly associated with risk of HFrEF at any dose range. In 
contrast, there was a significant, dose-dependent inverse association between LTPA levels 
and HFpEF risk. Finally, the dose-response relationship for BMI and HFpEF risk was also 
more linear and steeper than for HFrEF risk, such that higher BMI above the normal range 
was associated with greater increase in risk of HFpEF versus HFrEF.
Data on quantitative dose-response associations between LTPA and HF outcomes are sparse. 
Anderson et al. (42) demonstrated an inverse dose-dependent association between LTPA and 
risk of HF in a Swedish cohort. Furthermore, they observed a plateau in the risk reduction 
for HF at doses higher than 3 times the guideline-recommended minimum LTPA levels, 
likely due to fewer HF events at the very high end of LTPA distribution. More recently, in a 
study-level meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies with 370,460 participants and 20,203 HF 
events, we demonstrated a consistent, dose-dependent, inverse association between LTPA 
levels and HF risk, even at very high levels of PA (12). Our study findings confirm these

 previously reported observations, and provide further evidence supporting a consistent, dose-
dependent association of LTPA for HF prevention. This study also adds significantly to the 
available published data by characterizing, for the first time, the unique dose-response 
relationships between LTPA levels and risk of the 2 distinct HF phenotypes, HFpEF and 
HFrEF.
The observed differences in the dose-response relationship between LTPA and HFrEF versus 
HFpEF likely reflect differences in the potential mechanisms through which exercise might 
lower cardiovascular risk. The pattern of association between LTPA levels and HFrEF risk is 
similar to that reported for PA and coronary heart disease risk (43). It is possible that LTPA 
may lower HFrEF risk by reducing the atherosclerotic risk factor burden and associated 
coronary heart disease progression. In contrast, the protective effects of LTPA against 
HFpEF risk may be more related to the direct effect of LTPA and fitness on the key 
pathophysiological determinants of HFpEF development, including systemic inflammation, 
cardiac structure and function, visceral adiposity, and peripheral (skeletal muscle) oxygen 
extraction and utilization (44–48). Recent studies have demonstrated a significant 
association of low cardiorespiratory fitness/PA with diastolic dysfunction and decreased left 
ventricular compliance, 2 important cardiac determinants of HFpEF development, but not 
systolic function (14, 49). Similarly, studies have also demonstrated exercise training and 
higher LTPA levels are associated with lower visceral adiposity, lower systemic 
inflammation, and better skeletal muscle function (50–52). It is plausible that higher levels 
of LTPA, in excess of the current guideline-recommended doses, may be needed to achieve 
these pleiotropic effects and lower the risk of HFpEF.
We also observed a distinct dose-response relationship between BMI and risk of HFpEF and 
HFrEF. Higher BMI levels, above than normal range, were more strongly associated with 
HFpEF risk in a dose-dependent fashion compared with HFrEF risk. This finding is 
consistent with the findings from the Framingham Heart Study that identified BMI as a 
stronger predictor for HFpEF compared with HFrEF (53). Furthermore, our results are also 
supported by observations from longitudinal and cross-sectional cohort studies that 
demonstrate a strong association of general and central adiposity with measures of left 
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. (54–56) In contrast, the PREVEND study investigators 
reported similar associations between BMI and the risk of HFpEF versus HFrEF (57). There 
are several methodological differences between our pooled analysis and the PREVEND 
study that may underlie this discrepancy in study findings. These include a significantly 
lower number of HFpEF events, use of a higher EF cutoff for HFpEF, and lack of adjustment 
for PA levels in the adjusted analysis in the PREVEND study compared with our pooled 
analysis.
Our study findings may have important clinical and public health implications. Although 
HFpEF and HFrEF represent 2 distinct disease processes that have different underlying 
pathophysiological mechanisms and management strategies, the current guidelines for HF 
prevention do not have specific recommendations for lifestyle modification targeting HFpEF 
and HFrEF (58). Findings from our study highlight the stronger contribution of lifestyle risk 
factors to HFpEF risk versus HFrEF risk and suggest that the LTPA and BMI goals that must 
be targeted to prevent HFpEF and HFrEF may be different. Randomized controlled

 prevention studies are needed to further evaluate and more adequately test this hypothesis 
than can be done using observational cohort data, as in the present study.
Recent studies have demonstrated a temporal increase in prevalence of HFpEF relative to 
HFrEF and it is estimated that by 2020, up to two-thirds of hospitalized HF patients will 
have HFpEF (4, 59). Furthermore, evidence-based management of HFpEF patients continues 
to be a challenge, with several pharmacological therapies failing to improve clinical 
outcomes in randomized controlled trials. This scenario highlights the need for identification 
of additional approaches that can then be evaluated in randomized clinical trials to determine 
their efficacy and safety in treatment and prevention of HF subtypes. Recent studies have 
reported significant improvement in exercise tolerance and quality of life among HFpEF 
patients with nonpharmacological interventions, such as exercise training and maintenance 
of optimal weight (60, 61). Our study findings provide additional suggestive evidence that 
lifestyle interventions aiming to increase LTPA and achieve more optimal BMI goals need to 
be properly evaluated for use as preventive therapies for HFpEF in the at-risk population.
Several limitations to our study are noteworthy. First, owing to the observational nature of 
this study, there is a potential for residual or unmeasured confounding and a casual 
association between PA, BMI, and HF outcomes cannot be established. However, several 
factors, including the presence of consistent dose-response relationship for overall HF and 
HFpEF outcomes, biological plausibility of the observed associations, temporality in the 
relationship, and consistency with the previously reported associations between PA, BMI, 
and overall HF, enhance confidence in the internal validity of our results. Second, 
measurement errors in body weight, height, and inaccuracies in the self-reported PA levels 
might have affected our study results. However, given that the prospective study designs 
ensured that the PA and BMI exposures were assessed prior to ascertainment of HF cases, 
measurement errors would most likely be non-differential with respect to the HF subtypes, 
and tend to bias observed associations toward the null. It is unlikely that measurement error 
accounts substantially for the dose–response relationships observed in the present study. 
Third, we only focused on LTPA in our study, and did not evaluate occupational or total PA 
association with HF outcomes. This strategy was chosen a priori to allow for interpretation 
of our study findings in the context of the guideline recommendations on LTPA. Fourth, EF 
information was missing in 32% of the incident HF cases, which may have biased the results 
of association with HF subtypes. Fifth, we cannot completely exclude the potential for 
reverse causation, despite excluding individuals who developed HF within the first 2 years of 
the baseline examination. Finally, the high proportion of women in the pooled study 
population could limit the generalizability of the study findings in men. However, we did not 
observe any significant statistical interaction between sex and PA or BMI levels for the HF 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
we observed a dose-response association between LTPA, BMI, and risk of HF, with a more 
consistent, dose-dependent association between PA, BMI, and risk of HFpEF compared with 
HFrEF. These findings suggest the possible preventive role of lifestyle patterns for HFpEF in 
the community. In addition, these findings could also have implications for future guidelines

 aimed at the prevention of HFpEF in the general population. Adequately designed 
randomized prevention trials are needed to further evaluate this hypothesis and determine its 
implications for clinical and public health practice.

 PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE
Significant associations between lower levels of LTPA and higher BMI with the risk of 
developing HF are more consistent for patients with preserved than reduced left 
ventricular EFs.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK
Prospective trials are needed to assess the impact of increasing PA and weight reduction 
on the incidence of the 2 types of HF, and to explore the mechanisms responsible for the 
differences in impact.
