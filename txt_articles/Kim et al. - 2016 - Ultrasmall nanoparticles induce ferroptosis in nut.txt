 The design of cancer-targeting particles with precisely-tuned physiocochemical properties may 
enhance delivery of therapeutics and access to pharmacological targets. However, molecular level 
understanding of the interactions driving the fate of nanomedicine in biological systems remains 
elusive. Here, we show that ultrasmall (< 10 nm in diameter) poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coated 
silica nanoparticles, functionalized with melanoma-targeting peptides, can induce a form of 
programmed cell death known as ferroptosis in starved cancer cells and cancer-bearing mice. 
Tumor xenografts in mice intravenously injected with nanoparticles using a high-dose multiple 
injection scheme exhibit reduced growth or regression, in a manner that is reversed by the 
pharmacological inhibitor of ferroptosis, liproxstatin-1. These data demonstrate that ferroptosis 
can be targeted by ultrasmall silica nanoparticles and may have therapeutic potential.
Nanomaterials designed to target cancer may hold therapeutic potential by enhancing the 
delivery of therapeutics1–4, but their interactions with cancer in animal models, and long-
term effects on cells, remain poorly understood5–9. To examine the effects of nanoparticle 
ingestion on cells, we utilized ~6 nm surface-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol)-coated 
(PEGylated) near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent silica nanoparticles, referred to as Cornell dots 
(C′ dots), with diameters controllable down to the sub-10 nm range, as reported in detail 
elsewhere10. This FDA Investigational New Drug (IND)-approved hybrid organo-silica 
particle was previously shown to be a promising cancer molecular imaging agent in 
metastatic melanoma patients after functionalizing its surface with αvβ3 integrin-targeting 
peptides and radiolabels2,11. Preferential accumulation was observed within integrin-
expressing primary and/or metastatic melanomatous lesions in human subjects and animal 
melanoma models11,12, while, at the same time, demonstrating rapid renal clearance.
Given its potential clinical utility and its early adaptation for drug delivery applications13, 
we initially performed detailed cell biological studies using the latest generation of C dots, 
synthesized in water, referred to as C′ dots10, surface-functionalized with a 14-mer peptide 
analog, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH)14, which targets a different surface 
receptor expressed on malignant melanoma cells (i.e., melanocortin-1 receptor, MC1-R). 
Using a multiple high-dose injection scheme, with and without pharmacologic inhibition of 
ferroptosis, the resulting αMSH-PEG-C′ dots (Fig. 1a) were used herein to determine 
whether alterations in cell survival occurred in cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts over a 
wide dose range relative to that seen under control conditions, and whether cellular 
pathways were modulated by particle ingestion.
αMSH-PEG-C′ 
′ dots reside in lysosomes and are well-tolerated
Live imaging of MC1-R expressing human melanoma cells (M21) treated with particles for 
24 hours revealed colocalization of fluorescent αMSH-PEG-C′ dots with lysosomes, the 
latter visualized by expression of a GFP-tagged lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 
(LAMP1), indicating that ingested particles reside in lysosomal or late endosomal networks 
(Fig. 1b). M21 cells treated with increasing concentrations of αMSH-PEG-C′ dots up to 15 
μM showed similar survival and proliferation rates to those of control cells (Fig. 2a), 
demonstrating that incubation at even high particle concentrations is well-tolerated. We next 
examined if lysosomes were functioning properly within cells treated with αMSH-PEG-C′

 dots. To determine this, we examined the autophagy pathway, which targets intracellular 
substrates for lysosomal degradation. Autophagy was examined by quantifying the basal 
levels and turnover rates of the autophagy protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light 
chain 3 (LC3), which is lipidated onto autophagosomal membranes and becomes degraded 
following the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes15. The accumulation of the 
autophagosome-associated, lipidated form of LC3, or LC3-II, identified by its faster 
electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE gels relative to the non-lipidated form, LC3-I, can be 
quantified as a measure of autophagy induction or flux through lysosomes15. Cells treated 
with increasing concentrations of αMSH-PEG-C′ dots for 24 hours, from 0.15 to 15 μM, 
had similar relative LC3-II levels compared to control cells, suggesting that autophagy is not 
induced or perturbed by nanoparticle treatment (Fig. 2b). Importantly, the treatment of cells 
with a lysosomal inhibitor, concanamycin A (ConA), which inhibits lysosome function by 
raising pH, and blocks autophagosome degradation, resulted in a similar accumulation of 
LC3-II in particle-treated cells as compared to controls, demonstrating that lysosomes are 
functioning properly even when cells are loaded with high concentrations of αMSH-PEG-C′ 
dots (Fig. 2b).
αMSH-PEG-C′ 
′ dots induce the death of starved cells
Although αMSH-PEG-C′ dots were well-tolerated by cells cultured under nutrient-replete 
conditions, and the autophagy pathway and lysosome function appeared to be unperturbed, 
we further examined if particle treatment might affect cells cultured under nutrient-deprived 
conditions where autophagy is induced. Cells cultured in amino acid-free media were treated 
with αMSH-PEG-C′ dots and examined by time-lapse imaging. While amino acid 
deprivation was well-tolerated by M21 cells in the absence of particles, the treatment of 
amino acid-deprived cells with 15 μM αMSH-PEG-C′ dots, which had no effect on cells in 
nutrient-replete media, surprisingly led to cell death at high rates, detected by the uptake of 
Sytox Green, a membrane-impermeable nucleic acid dye that labels cells with ruptured 
plasma membranes (Fig. 2c). This demonstrates that while αMSH-PEG-C′ dots are 
generally well-tolerated, nutrient-deprived cancer cells are sensitive to treatment. To 
determine whether this finding could have consequences for tumor growth in vivo, we 
incubated M21 cells with αMSH-PEG-C′ dots in culture under nutrient-replete conditions, 
which had no effect on cell viability (Fig. 2a and Supp. Fig. 1a), and then injected particle-
exposed cells, as well as particle-unexposed cells, into mice as flank tumor xenografts, to 
promote a nutrient-deprived state that is known to result from a lack of vascularization in 
early xenograft tumors16. M21 cells loaded with αMSH-PEG-C′ dots demonstrated 
statistically significant growth-inhibition (p<0.001) relative to non-particle exposed cells 
(Fig. 2d). In fact, no measurable tumor growth occurred from particle-exposed cells up to 10 
days following cell injection. These findings suggested that treatment with αMSH-PEG-C′ 
dots at high concentrations may induce cell death under conditions of nutrient deprivation in 
culture and in vivo.
αMSH-PEG-C′ 
′ dot-induced death occurs by ferroptosis
We sought to identify the mechanism of how cells treated with αMSH-PEG-C′ dots 
undergo cell death under nutrient-deprived conditions. Careful inspection of the morphology

 of dying cells suggested a form of necrosis, involving cell swelling and plasma membrane 
rupture, in the absence of cell blebbing and fragmentation that is typically observed during 
apoptosis (Fig. 3a, Supp. Fig. 1b). In order to more definitively identify the mechanism of 
cell death, we utilized two non-tumor cell lines, MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells 
and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF), that were also observed to die at high rates when 
cultured in amino acid-free media in the presence of αMSH-PEG-C′ dots (Fig. 3b). Cells 
rendered resistant to apoptosis, by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 
(MCF10A-Bcl2) (Supp. Fig. 1c) or by genetic deletion of Bax and Bak (Bax/Bak−/− 
MEFs)17,18, underwent cell death at rates similar to control cells, suggesting that αMSH-
PEG-C′ dot-induced cell death does not occur by apoptosis (Fig. 3c, d). Next, we examined 
if cell death was occurring by necroptosis, a programmed form of necrosis that requires the 
RIPK3 kinase19. Ripk3−/− knockout MEFs, which are resistant to necroptosis (Supp. Fig. 
1d), also underwent cell death at rates similar to controls, suggesting that nanoparticle 
treatment does not induce necroptosis (Fig. 3e). We further determined if a recently-
described form of cell death involving the autophagy pathway, autosis20, could be involved, 
by treating autophagy-related gene 5 knockout MEFs (Atg5 −/− MEFs), completely 
deficient for autophagy, with α-MSH-PEG-C′ dots in the absence of amino acids. Atg5 −/− 
MEFs underwent cell death at rates similar to those of controls, demonstrating that αMSH-
PEG-C′ dot-induced cell death does not involve autophagy, and is not autosis (Fig. 3e). 
Collectively, the foregoing data demonstrate that cell death, induced by a combination of 
particle treatment and amino acid deprivation, occurs independently of apoptosis, 
necroptosis, and autosis.
We next examined if ferroptosis, a recently described cell death mechanism that occurs via 
an iron- and lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent process, and is induced by 
glutathione depletion21, could be involved in αMSH-PEG-C′ dot-induced cell death. We 
first tested whether ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-1, pharmacological inhibitors of 
ferroptosis, that are scavengers of lipid ROS, could block cell death in this context. 
Treatment with either inhibitor rescued cell viability, reducing cell death to levels occurring 
under amino acid-deprived conditions in the absence of nanoparticles (Fig. 4a and Supp. Fig. 
1e). Nanoparticle-induced cell death was also inhibited by treatment with other antioxidants, 
including butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), ascorbic acid (Asc Acid) and trolox, or, 
alternatively, by glutathione repletion through the addition of glutathione or N-acetylcysteine 
(NAC), a precursor of glutathione (Fig. 4b). To examine if lipid ROS accumulate during 
nanoparticle-induced cell death, we imaged particle-exposed cells in the presence of the 
lipid oxidation indicator C11-BODIPY. Increased staining prior to cell death was seen to 
occur in response to treatment with the known ferroptosis-inducing agent erastin, in a 
liproxstatin-1-inhibitable manner (Fig. 4c, Supp. Fig. 1f). Like cell death induced by erastin 
treatment, lipid ROS detected by C11-BODIPY staining accumulated several hours prior to 
the induction of cell death by nanoparticle treatment under amino acid-free conditions (Fig. 
4c). To further examine if nanoparticle-induced death is dependent on iron, a known 
requirement for ferroptosis, we found that cells treated with deferoxamine (DFO), an iron 
chelator used for treating iron overload and an agent reported to block ferroptosis21, almost 
completely inhibited cell death (Fig. 4d). Together these data demonstrate that treatment of 
amino acid-starved cells with high αMSH-PEG-C′ dot concentrations induces ferroptosis.

 Interestingly, ferroptosis in this context was also observed to propagate from cell to cell in a 
wave-like manner (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Movie 1), unlike that found for cells undergoing 
other types of death, such as apoptosis (Supp. Fig. 1g, Supplementary Movie 2). These 
findings suggested cell-cell communication of a death-inducing signal, similar to a recent 
report of ferroptosis occurring in renal tubules in response to treatment with erastin22.
αMSH-PEG-C′ 
′ dots inhibit tumor growth
We next examined if ferroptosis could be induced by nanoparticle treatment in a wider panel 
of cancer cells. Like M21 cells, BxPC3 pancreatic carcinoma cells, H1650 lung carcinoma 
cells, HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells, and 786-O renal carcinoma cells underwent high rates of 
necrosis when treated under amino acid free conditions with αMSH-PEG-C′ dots, 
indicating that cell death can be induced by a combination of particle treatment and nutrient 
deprivation in a variety of different cancer cell types (Fig. 5a–c, Supp. Fig. 2a). Interestingly, 
HT-1080 cells underwent necrosis in response to nanoparticle treatment even when cultured 
in full media (Fig. 5c), as well as in starvation media at 10-fold lower particle concentrations 
(Supp. Fig. 2b), suggesting that these cells are particularly sensitive to particle-induced 
ferroptosis. We further investigated whether particle-induced treatment responses could be 
generated in 786-O renal carcinoma and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma xenograft models. Using a 
multi-dosing delivery scheme, tumor growth was assessed over a 10-day period after three 
high-dose intravenous (i.v.) treatments of either targeted particle probe (n = 5) or 0.9% saline 
solution (n = 3) in immunosuppressed mice bearing flank 786-O or HT-1080 tumors. 
Relative to the rapidly increasing tumor volumes measured after injection with saline 
vehicle, statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed with multiple-dose 
particle treatments for both tumor types (Fig. 6a,b), greater for HT-1080 xenografts. 
Surprisingly, this was accompanied by partial tumor regression exceeding 50% for all 
particle-treated HT-1080 tumors (range: 57%-78%; mean 64%) within a 4–5 day interval 
after initial injection (Fig. 6c). At study termination, statistically significant reductions in 
treated tumor volumes (HT-1080: mean ~85%; p<0.001; 786-O: mean ~73%; p<0.01) were 
found relative to control volumes (Figs. 6a,b). Intense fluorescence signal overlying the 
xenograft by whole-body optical imaging (Fig. 6d) suggested particle localization. 
Immunohistochemical staining for the macrophage marker, Mac-2, revealed large numbers 
of recruited macrophages surrounding treated tumors relative to that seen around control 
tumors, both at low and high magnification (Figs. 6e–h).
To further examine if the inhibition of tumor growth resulting from nanoparticle treatment 
could be related to ferroptosis, we treated tumor-bearing mice with daily intraperitoneal 
(i.p.) doses of liproxstatin-1 for 10 days to determine the effects on particle-induced tumor 
shrinkage. Notably, in HT-1080 xenografted mice (n = 3) subsequently administered three 
high-dose particle treatments, liproxstatin-1 administration significantly reduced growth 
inhibition to levels nearly equivalent to those seen in non particle-exposed tumors (Fig. 6i). 
Using a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model with a logit link, average daily 
growth in particle-exposed tumors treated with liproxstatin-1 was 14.6 mm3 (95% CI: 10.1–
18.9), as compared with −0.87 mm3 (95% CI: −1.06 to −0.69) for particle treatment alone, a 
difference of 15.3 mm3 (CI: 13.1 to 17.6; p <0.001, Wald test from GEE). Corresponding

 particle-exposed tumor specimens were significantly smaller on average than particle-treated 
tumors receiving daily liproxstatin-1 (Fig. 6i, inset).
Conclusions
Here we demonstrate that the combined treatment of cells with αMSH-PEG-C′ dots and 
amino acid starvation can synergize to induce the cell death program, ferroptosis, and that 
high-dose particle delivery can inhibit tumor growth and cause tumor regression; these 
effects are reversible with liproxstatin-1. Although their role in wound repair (through 
engulfment of cellular debris) is well established, the significance of increased numbers of 
macrophages around particle-treated, as opposed to control, tumours remains unclear23. It is 
known that a high degree of macrophage plasticity can occur in response to local cues from 
the tumor microenvironment24, and that, upon activation, macrophages can assume a 
spectrum of roles needed to maintain tissue homeostasis25, GPX including shifts in function 
associated with tumor shrinkage24.
These data thus define a potential therapeutic application for molecularly-targeted C′ dots, 
already in clinical trials for cancer imaging and detection2, but without the need for surface-
attached cytotoxic agents. An important question raised by these findings is how these 
particles induce ferroptosis. Surface-modification of particles with αMSH peptides for 
targeting cancers enhances cellular internalization (data not shown). Interestingly, particle 
surface modification with αMSH is not required for ferroptosis in the cell lines tested. We 
have observed its induction, albeit more slowly, with unmodified PEGylated C′ dots. The 
slower rate of ferroptosis induction may reflect a slower rate of internalization of unmodified 
particles relative to αMSH-modified platforms (Supp. Fig. 3a).
We therefore have considered that the native silica particle itself has ferroptosis-inducing 
activity, as deprotonated surface silanol groups and/or fractal internal structure may lead to 
iron adsorption and/or incorporation (i.e., loading) within its structure. We have indeed 
found iron loading of αMSH-PEG-C′ dots incubated with culture media, as compared with 
doubly de-ionized water preparations (Supp. Fig. 3b, Supp. S1). Increasing amounts of iron 
were loaded into particles in a concentration-dependent manner upon exposure to ferric 
oxide solutions. These findings were accompanied by a decrease in iron-loading capacity as 
they became saturated at high iron concentration (Supp. S1). Further, increased intracellular 
iron levels were found for αMSH-PEG-C′ dot nanoparticle-treated cells compared to non-
treated cells (Supp. Fig. 3b, Table S1). Consistent with a model in which particles deliver 
iron into cells, particle-treated cells upregulated expression of the heavy chain of ferritin 
(FTH1) that binds cytosolic iron (Supp. Fig. 3c). We further found that iron loading into 
cells by treatment with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) is sufficient to mimic particle 
treatment and induce ferroptosis in amino acid-starved cells (Supp. Fig. 3d), suggesting that 
nanoparticles may engage ferroptosis by loading iron into cells.
Increased iron uptake could lead to the depletion of glutathione, conceivably due to 
increased ROS generation. We do find suppression of glutathione levels in particle-treated 
cells (Supp. Fig. 3e). Pre-treatment with erastin, which inhibits glutathione production by 
blocking cystine uptake, sensitizes cells to particle-induced ferroptosis, suggesting that

 glutathione depletion is rate-limiting for particle-induced death (Supp. Fig. 3f). Taken 
together, our data support a model whereby particle-induced ferroptosis is executed 
following iron uptake into cells, suppression of glutathione, and accumulation of lipid ROS 
(Supp. Fig. 4). Lipid ROS may accumulate in glutathione-suppressed cells due to lowered 
activity of the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) enzyme that protects cells against lipid 
peroxidation and inhibits ferroptosis26,27. We have not found that particle treatment inhibits 
GPX4 activity in an enzymatic assay from treated cell lysates (Supp. Fig. 3g), consistent 
with the model that particle treatment does not lead to lipid peroxidation by direct inhibition 
of GPX4. We additionally note that particle-induced ferroptosis does not require the 
presence of glutamine, unlike ferroptosis occurring in starved cells28, as our studies also 
utilize amino acid-free conditions in which enhanced iron uptake may bypass requirements 
for glutamine.
While the concentration of nanoparticles used here to either induce in vitro cell death or 
inhibit in vivo tumor growth is at least four orders of magnitude higher than what is used 
currently in human subjects for single-dose imaging-based studies2, local concentrations 
could be driven to much higher levels at tumor sites as part of a multi-dosing strategy, 
combinatorial treatment regimen, and/or by direct catheter infusion at the target site. Such a 
dosing schedule would be designed to yield maximum tumor-to-background ratios while 
reducing off-target toxicities and promoting efficient renal clearance. It is notable that the 
leakiness of tumor vasculature is thought to allow the accumulation of systemically injected 
nanoparticles in tumor tissues29, while contributing to nutrient deprivation within tumors, 
suggesting that the synergism between nanoparticles and nutrient deprivation may be 
restricted to tumor sites in vivo. Some cancers may also be particularly sensitive to this 
mechanism of cell death, which could lower the threshold of particle concentration needed 
to achieve an anti-tumor effect. Indeed, we have found that HT-1080 cancer cells undergo 
αMSH-PEG-C′ dot-induced ferroptosis even under nutrient-replete conditions (Fig. 5c), 
and these cells are also killed in amino acid-deprived conditions with 10-fold lower 
nanoparticle concentration (Supp. Fig. 2b). It is notable that HT-1080 tumors are well-
vascularized (Supp. Fig. 5a), suggesting that the sensitivity of these cancer cells to particle-
induced death, even under nutrient-replete conditions (Fig. 5c), may contribute to the strong 
anti-tumor effect that is observed following intravenous particle delivery.
While conceivably the sensitivity of some cancers could lower the particle concentrations 
needed to exert an anti-tumor effect, we have also found that multiple high-dose αMSH-
PEG-C′ dot treatments are well tolerated. Evaluation of tumor, hepatic, renal, and 
hematologic specimens from particle- and vehicle-treated HT-1080- and 786-O-bearing 
mice, performed at the termination of the study, showed no significant group differences in 
complete blood counts, serum chemistries, and hepatic and renal histopathology, with the 
exception of indirect and total bilirubin serum concentrations, which were moderately 
elevated in particle-treated mice as against controls (Supp. Tables S2, S3). However, no 
mechanism could be ascribed to this finding given the lack of hemolysis on complete blood 
counts and absence of liver injury on histopathology and serum chemistries. The extent of 
macrophage staining among particle-treated and vehicle-treated tumor specimens is also 
summarized (Supp. Table S4).

 The discovery of nanoparticle-induced ferroptosis as a redox modulator of cell fate, as well 
as a mediator of tumor regression and growth inhibition, suggests that it may be possible to 
exploit this process therapeutically to synchronously and selectively kill those cancers most 
susceptible to this mechanism. Elucidating the basis for such differential tumor sensitivity is 
essential. It will be important, for instance, to assess the extent of tumor vascularity, as this 
parameter will critically influence particle delivery, nutrient and oxygenation status, and 
treatment response. As such, its assessment across a variety of pre-clinical tumor types may 
enable better screening of models suitable for induction of cell death by this mechanism, as 
well as for stratifying patients in the future to appropriate combinatorial treatment 
paradigms.
It will also be critical to determine whether controlled variations in C′ dot properties –
structure, composition, or surface chemistry– enhance, or even abrogate, induction of 
ferroptosis. We found, for instance, that C′ dot size plays a critical role in the magnitude of 
the effect observed under amino acid-deprived conditions (Supp. Fig. 5b). Smaller diameter 
(~6 nm) PEGylated C′ dots led to significantly higher percentages of Sytox Green labeled 
HT-1080 cells (i.e., 80%) cells compared to that found for larger diameter (~10 nm) C′ dots 
(~25%).
Finally, we note that while the response to liproxstatin-1 provides evidence for ferroptosis as 
an anti-tumor mechanism in vivo, other mechanisms may be contributory, including 
modulation of the tumor microenvironment, given marked macrophage recruitment to 
particle-treated tumors (Fig. 6g,h, HT-1080; Supp. Fig. 5c, 786-O)24, an area under active 
investigation. Altogether, our findings lay the groundwork for exploiting these ultrasmall 
silica nanoparticles as effective ferroptosis-inducing agents in sensitive tumors.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture and constructs
MEF and HT-1080 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) were cultured in 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (MSKCC Media Preparation Facility) 
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) with penicillin/
streptomycin (Corning, Corning, NY). MCF10A cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM/F12 
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 5% horse serum (Atlanta Biologicals, 
Flowery Branch, GA), 20 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 
0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma) with penicillin/
streptomycin. M21 (ATCC), BxPC3 (ATCC), H1650 (ATCC) and 786-O (ATCC) cells were 
cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS with penicillin/streptomycin. 
Cell lines have not been authenticated, as these were purchased from ATCC, except for 
MEFs, which were validated with functional studies as being the correct knockouts. Cells 
were routinely verified as mycoplasma-free by DAPI imaging. Amino acid-free medium was 
prepared by dialyzing heat-inactivated FBS (for MEF, HT-1080, M21, BxPC3, and H1650 
cells) or horse serum (for MCF10A cells) for 4 h, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in MWCO 3500 dialysis tubing (21-152-9; Fisherbrand, 
Pittsburgh, PA) and addition to base media prepared without amino acids. pRetro–Lamp1–

biological assays with the exception of ConA which was added 1 hour prior to lysis for 
western blotting.
Peptide synthesis
A modified melanocortin-1 receptor targeting peptide Re(Arg11)CCMSH14 with a double 
aminohexanoic acid (Ahx2) aliphatic linker and N-Ac-Cys was synthesized using standard 
solid phase Fmoc peptide chemistry. The rhenium-cyclized αMSH peptide analog, Ac-Cys1-
(Ahx)2-dLys2-Re[Cys-Cys-Glu-His-dPhe-Arg-Trp-Cys]-Arg-Pro-Val-NH2, was analyzed 
and purified on a Beckman Coulter High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) 
system coupled with an LCQ FLEET Ion Trap Mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and finally recovered by lyophilization.
Synthesis and characterization of αMSH-PEG-C′ 
′ dots
Fluorescent silica nanoparticles (C′ dots) of different size, encapsulating the organic dye, 
Cy5, were synthesized in water as previously described30. αMSH peptides were conjugated 
to maleimido-terminated heterobifunctional polyethylene glycol silane (mal-PEG-silane) via 
its N-terminal acetylated cysteine thiol to form αMSH-PEG-silane. Conjugates were 
attached to the particle surface in the PEGylation step as described previously10,30 to 
generate αMSH functionalized C′ dots, or αMSH-PEG-C′ dots. Synthesized particle 
samples were dialyzed in water and purified by gel permeation chromatography (GPC, Bio-
Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, California) prior to further characterization10. Absorption 
and emission spectral profiles for the encapsulated and native Cy5 dye were obtained using a 
Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) and a fluorescence 
spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Inc, Birmington, NJ). Hydrodynamic 
radius, brightness, and concentration of αMSH-PEG-C′ dots, as against free Cy5 dye, were 
determined using a homebuilt fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) set up configured 
with a solid-state 633-nm excitation10.

 Western blotting
Cells were scraped into ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM 
EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS with protease inhibitor cocktail) and lysed for 10 min on ice. 
Lysates were then centrifuged at 15,870g for 20 min at 4 °C and protein was quantified by 
BCA assay (Pierce, Waltham, MA). Samples were separated on 15% polyacrylamide SDS–
PAGE gels and transferred to a polyvinyldifluoride membrane which was blocked with 
TBST plus 5% BSA and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies (anti-LC3A/B 
(4108; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-FTH1 (3998; Cell Signaling), and anti-Actin 
(A1978; Sigma)), diluted in blocking buffer. Blots were incubated with horseradish 
peroxidase conjugated to secondary antibodies and protein was detected using enhanced 
chemiluminescence detection (Invitrogen). Densitometry analysis was carried out using 
ImageJ software (NIH).
Time-lapse microscopy
Cells were plated onto glass-bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) overnight and 
fluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) images were acquired every 30 min 
for indicated times using a Nikon TI-E inverted microscope, a CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD 
(charge-coupled device) camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), a live-cell incubation chamber 
to maintain cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and NIS Elements software (Nikon, Melville, NY). 
Cell fates, including cell survival, death, and proliferation, were manually quantified and 
processed using NIS Elements software and Image J.
Glutathione quantification
For glutathione measurements, HT-1080 cells were plated on 6cm cell culture dishes, 
incubated with 15 μM αMSH-tagged nanoparticles in amino acid-free DMEM + 10% 
dialyzed FBS and harvested approximately 2 hours before the expected time of death. As 
controls, cells were treated with a mix of 3 parts full or amino acid-free DMEM and 1 part 
H2O, or 100 μM BSO in full media. Cells were washed 3× with cold PBS and harvested 
through cell scraping in 50 μL cold lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were measured using 
the BCA assay and sample volumes were adjusted so that each had the same final protein 
concentration. Total glutathione was measured using the Glutathione Assay Kit (Cayman 
Chemicals, 703002) and reduced glutathione was measured using the QuantiChromTM 
Glutathione Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems, DIGT-250) according to manufacturer’s 
instructions.
Iron measurements
For iron loading capacity measurements of C′ dots, 50 μL αMSH-PEG-C′ dots (60 μM) 
were added to either 150 μL iron-containing media (8.6μM) or to 150 μL FeCl3 solutions 
prepared over a range of iron (Fe3+) concentrations (2 μM to 2 mM, Table S1). Solutions 
were spun at room temperature (160 rpm) for 48 hours, followed by separation of free iron 
from C′ dots using a PD-10 column, and eluting in water. Cellular samples were incubated 
with and without particles in media for 48 hours prior to centrifugation, pelleted, and 
washed three times prior to re-suspending in phosphate buffered saline solution. Iron 
measurements (parts per billion, ppb) were determined using Microwave Plasma - Atomic

 Emission Spectroscopy, along with iron-loading capacities. Iron loading capacity was 
computed as the ratio of the amount of iron in purified particle-exposed C′ dots (or cells), 
divided by the total amount of initial iron measured prior to purification, and multiplied by 
100. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
GPX4 Activity Assay
The Gpx4 specific activity assay was performed according to Roveri and colleagues31. In 
brief, frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μL lysis buffer (100 mM KH2PO4/
K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM KCl, 0.1 % CHAPS, 3 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 
protease inhibitor cocktail) and homogenized by 50 pestle strokes. Samples were incubated 
for 15 min on ice and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20000 g and 10 min, 4°C). 
50 μL of the supernatant from homogenized cells were used to measure the enzymatic 
activity in 1 ml of assay buffer (100 mM TrisHCl pH 7.8 containing 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 % 
Triton X, 3 mM GSH, 200 μM NADPH and 0.6 U/ml glutathione reductase) in the presence 
of 20 μM phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (PCOOH). Gpx4 activity is determined by the 
glutathione reductase-dependent consumption of NADPH detectable by a decrease in 
absorbance at 340 nm in a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Device GmbH). Protein 
content in the samples was determined by the colorimetric 660 nm Pierce Protein Assay 
method (Pierce, Waltham, MA).
Animal models and tumor inoculation
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
and followed NIH guidelines for animal welfare. Human melanoma (M21) xenografts were 
generated on the shaved flanks of immunodeficient male SCID/Beige C.B-17/IcrHsd-
PrkdcscidLystbg-J mice (6–8 weeks old, Harlan Laboratories, South Easton, MA). Human 
sarcoma HT-1080 and 786-O flank xenografts (~2.0 × 106 cells/100 μl) were additionally 
generated in the same model. Average initial tumor volumes of 45 – 75 mm3 were used for 
all studies. For all in vivo studies, three animals per group were used. No randomization was 
used and no blinding was performed.
In vivo dosing strategy and examination
Five million M21 cells, cultured in serum-supplemented media, were subcutaneously 
implanted into the right flank of mice using a 23-gauge trocar needle to establish melanoma 
xenografts 2 days after particle exposure (n=3) or without exposure (n=3). In a subsequent 
study, mice were assigned to one of two different treatment groups to evaluate the response 
of HT-1080 and 786-O tumors to high-concentrations (60 μM) of i.v.-injected αMSH-PEG-
C′ dots (n=5 mice; 200 μl) administered three times over a 10-day period (i.e., days 0, 4, 7). 
Control HT-1080 and 786-O mice (n=3) were administered 0.9% saline vehicle at the same 
time points. In a third treatment study, HT-1080 mice were assigned to one of two groups to 
evaluate response to three, high-concentration doses (60 μM) of i.v.-injected αMSH-PEG-C′ 
dots (n=3 mice; 200 μl) alone or following intraperitoneal administration of liproxstatin-1 
(n=3 mice, 125 mg/kg) over a 10-day period. Tumor sizes were measured using calipers over 
the treatment interval. All mice were examined by palpation at the site of tumor cell 
inoculation, and were observed daily over until the termination of tumor growth studies for

 signs of morbidity or mortality. Two perpendicular diameters (d1 ≤ d2) of the tumor used to 
calculate the tumor volume (V; 4/3·π·d12·d2/8) were measured with calipers daily following 
the injection of cells.
In vivo fluorescence imaging
Animals were anesthetized using isoflurane and whole body optical fluorescence imaging 
was acquired to identify nanoparticle fluorescence at the tumor site. Mice were scanned for 
0.1 to 1 seconds using the IVIS Spectrum photon-counting device optical imaging system 
(Xenogen, Alameda, CA) with the blocks and filters for Cy5 fluorescence (excitation 650 
nm, emission 680 nm), and for background fluorescence (excitation 465 nm, emission 600 
nm), selected according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Fluorescence background 
was likewise subtracted according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Fluorescence signal 
was reported as radiant efficiency ((photons/s/cm2/sr)/mW/cm2).
Histopathologic analysis
Immediately after terminating the in vivo imaging study, HT-1080 and 786-O male and 
female mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation, and representative particle-exposed (n=2) 
and control (n=1) tumors, as well as hepatic and renal specimens, were excised at necropsy. 
Hematologic specimens were additionally obtained for complete blood counts and serum 
chemistries. Excised tumors, livers, and kidneys were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin 
for 24 hours, processed in alcohol and xylene, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5-micron 
thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Additional tumor sections were 
stained by immunohistochemistry for Mac-2 (primary antibody Cedarlane CL8942B applied 
at concentration of 1:100 following heat-induced epitope retrieval [HIER] in a pH 6.0 
buffer), myeloperoxidase (Dako A0398, 1:1000, HIER pH 6.0), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell 
Signaling Technology 9661, 1:250, HIER pH6.0), and Ki-67 (Abcam ab16667, 1:100, HIER 
pH 9.0). Mac-2 staining was performed manually with an avidin-biotin detection system 
(Vectastain ABC Elite Kit, Vector Laboratories, PK-6100). Other stains were performed on a 
Leica Bond RX automated stainer using the Bond Polymer Refine detection kit (Leica 
Biosystem DS9800). Tumor sections were also stained by the TUNEL method as previously 
described. All slides were examined by a board-certified veterinary pathologist.
Tumor Vascularity Assessment
Tumor vascularity was assessed by staining HT-1080 tumors by immunohistochemistry for 
CD31 on a Leica Bond RX automated staining platform (Leica Biosystems). Following 
heat-induced epitope retrieval at pH 9.0, the primary antibody (rat monoclonal, catalog 
#DIA-310; Dianova) was applied at a concentration of 1:250 and was followed by 
application of a polymer detection system (Novocastra Bond Polymer Refine Detection, 
Leica Biosystems).
Statistics
Volume-time profiles were compared between the two treatment groups using robust 
standard errors calculated by a generalized estimating equations approach32. Particle-treated 
tumor growth profiles, with and without a pharmacological inhibitor to ferroptosis,

taken into account by using generalized estimating equations. We assigned statistical 
significance at P < 0.05.

control untreated cells. Data show mean tumor volume over 22 days of growth from three 
tumors per group. Error bars indicate mean+/− standard error of the mean. Particle-treated 
M21 cells showed statistically significant (p<0.001) growth inhibition compared with 
untreated control cells over the study interval. P-value is from a Wald test in a regression 
model estimated by generalized estimating equations to take into account the longitudinal

 Figure 4. Ferroptosis is the underlying mechanisms of αMSH particle-induced cell death
a, Quantification of cell death (Sytox green +) in MCF10A cells cultured in full media (Full) 
or amino acid-starved (AA-st) conditions in the presence or absence of 15μM αMSH-PEG-
C′ dots and (a) 1μM Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) after 40 hours. Error bars indicate mean +/− 
standard deviation. N=3 per group. Each replicate is from one biological experiment, 
quantified with five independent fields of view. b, Quantification of cell death (Sytox green 
+) in MCF10A cells cultured in full media (Full) or amino acid-starved (AA-st) conditions 
in the presence or absence of 15μM αMSH-PEG -C′ dots and 50νM butylated 
hydroxyanisole (BHA), 200νM ascorbic acid (Asc Acid), 100νM Trolox, 10mM N-
acetylcusteine (NAC), or 5mM glutathione (GSH) after 40 hours. Error bars indicate mean 
+/− standard deviation. N=5 per group. Each replicate is from one biological experiment, 
quantified with five independent fields of view. c, Lipid ROS accumulate prior to death in 
cells treated with 15μM αMSH-PEG-C′dots and amino acid withdrawal. Images show 
treated cells cultured in the presence of C11-BODIPY that detects lipid ROS. Note that the 
fluorescence intensity of C11-BODIPY increases several hours before cell death (times 
indicated on each image prior to cell death in bottom image). Scale bar=10μm. Graph: 
quantification of C11-BODIPY fluorescence in particle-treated and amino acid-starved cells 
(red line), or erastin-treated cells (black line). Mean intensities out of five cells +/− standard 
deviation are shown from one biological experiment. Time zero indicates the time of cell 
death determined by DIC microscopy. Note that C11-BODIPY staining increases in intensity 
between three and four hours prior to cell death. d, Quantification of cell death (Sytox green 
+) in MCF10A cells cultured in full media (Full) or amino acid-starved (AA-st) conditions 
in the presence or absence of 15μM αMSH-PEG-C′ dots and 100μM deferoxamine (DFO).

 Figure 6. αMSH-PEG-C′ 
′ dots inhibit tumor growth in 786-O and HT-1080 xenograft models
a,b, Graphical summary of 786-O (a) and HT-1080 (b) average tumor volume measurements 
in αMSH-PEG-C′ dot-treated (‘particles’; n=5) and control (‘saline-vehicle; n=3) mice; 
error bars indicate standard deviation. Three, high-dose (12 nanomoles (nmol)/dose) αMSH-
PEG-C′ dot or saline vehicle control treatments (30 micromoles/dose) were i.v.-injected 
(arrows) over a 10-day period, with particle-treated tumours, on average, demonstrating 
growth inhibition, greater for HT-1080, relative to saline-treated controls. c, Individual 
HT-1080 tumor volume measurements from part (b) are shown for particle-treated (‘T’) 
versus saline-treated (‘C’) mice. Relative to control tumor volumes, data show marked 
inhibition of tumor growth and partial tumor regression after particle treatments (HT-1080: 
p<0.001; 786-OL P<0.01). P-values are from a Wald test in a regression model estimated by 
generalized estimating equations to take into account the longitudinal nature of the data. d, 
Left image: whole body Cy5 fluorescent imaging of a representative H1080 tumor xenograft 
(arrows). Right image: low-power view of H&E-stained tissue sections from representative 
control (top) and treated (bottom) tumors reveal a densely cellular and invasive neoplasm 
exhibiting multifocal necrosis. Control specimens are noted to be disproportionately larger 
in size than the corresponding treated ones without evident morphological differences. e–h, 
Immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections with macrophage marker, Mac-2, shows 
scattered macrophages (arrow) surrounding control tumor sections (T) on (e) low and (g) 
high power views, while corresponding (f) low and (h) high power views of Mac-2 stained 
treated sections show large numbers of Mac-2 positive cells circumscribing the tumor at

 similar locations (boxes, d, f; arrows). Small numbers of intratumoral Mac-2 positive cells 
are also noted. i, Graphical summary of individual HT-1080 tumor volume measurements in 
mice undergoing combined inhibitor (Liproxstatin-1) and particle treatment (T+L; n=3) 
versus particle treatment alone (T; n=3). Three high-dose (12 nmol/dose) αMSH-PEG-C′ 
dot treatments (with and without i.p.-injected Liproxstatin-1) were given over a 10-day 
period. Relative to particle treatment alone, marked progression of tumor growth is seen 
following combined inhibitor and particle treatment (p<0.001). Image: Representative 
particle-exposed tumors reveal specimens to be disproportionately larger in size when 
additionally treated with Liproxstatin-1 (right tumor). Scale bars: 1 mm (d, e, and f); 50 μm 
(g, h); 1 cm (j).
