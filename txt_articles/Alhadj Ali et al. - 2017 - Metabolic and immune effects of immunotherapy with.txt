One Sentence Summary: 
Intradermal administration of up to 12 doses over 6 months of the HLA-DR4 restricted 
proinsulin peptide epitope, C19-A3, to adults with new onset type 1 diabetes is safe and in 
some subjects is associated with changes in immune regulation. 
 
Abstract: 
Immunotherapy using short immunogenic peptides of disease-related autoantigens restores 
immune tolerance in preclinical disease models. We studied safety and mechanistic effects of 
injecting HLA-DR4(B1*0401)-restricted immunodominant proinsulin-peptide intradermally 2- or 
4-weekly for 6-months in newly-diagnosed type 1 diabetes. Treatment was well tolerated with 
no systemic or local hypersensitivity. Placebo subjects showed a significant decline in 
stimulated C-peptide (measuring insulin reserve) at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months versus baseline, 
while no significant change was seen in the 4-weekly peptide group at these timepoints or the 
2-weekly group at 3, 6 and 9-months. Placebo group daily insulin use increased by 50 per cent 
over 12-months, but remained unchanged in the intervention groups. C-peptide retention in 
treated subjects associated with proinsulin-stimulated IL-10 production, increased FoxP3 
expression by Tregs, low baseline levels of activated β-cell-specific CD8 T-cells as well as 
favorable β-cell stress markers (proinsulin:C-peptide ratio). Thus proinsulin-peptide 
immunotherapy is safe, does not accelerate decline in β-cell function and is associated with 
antigen-specific and non-specific immune modulation.

Introduction 
Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by progressive, immune-
mediated loss of β-cell mass and function. Following clinical presentation, most patients 
undergo continued attrition of remaining functional β-cell mass, and progress to the point at 
which residual C-peptide, a surrogate marker for insulin secretion, is absent or present at very 
low levels in the circulation (1, 2). Two factors compound the clinical burden of type 1 diabetes. 
First, despite optimized insulin administration regimes, chronic hyperglycaemia and 
hyperglycaemic excursions are unavoidable in most patients and result in complications 
including retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, which reduce life expectancy by an 
average of over 10 years (3). Second, it is apparent that the incidence of the disease has been 
increasing by approximately 4 per cent per year in recent decades, most notably in children and 
adolescents (4). Despite over 25 years of efforts to develop immunomodulatory therapies, no 
therapeutic has yet emerged that balances robust efficacy with acceptable safety and 
tolerability for patients. This pharmacopoeial poverty comes at a time when there is 
increasingly clear evidence that retained C-peptide secretion, even down to the limits of 
conventional detection, is associated with significantly improved metabolic control and reduced 
risk of the serious diabetic complications that impact upon quality and duration of life (5-7).  
In the same timeframe, an understanding of the numerous immunological pathways that 
contribute to β-cell loss has emerged. These include delineation of effector pathways, such as 
autoreactive CD4 T cells secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and CD8 T cells with cytotoxic 
activity upon recognition of β-cell targets (8-10). There is also evidence that immune regulatory 
pathways may be compromised or unable to adequately control effector responses (11, 12). 
These findings relate to conventional, FoxP3+CD25hi Tregs, but also to regulatory autoreactive 
CD4 T cells that secrete the immune suppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) (8, 13), which 
have been shown at the clonal level to mediate linked suppression of inflammatory T cells (14).  
These findings promote consideration of antigen-specific immunotherapy (ASI) as an approach 
for type 1 diabetes, since it has been shown in preclinical models of inflammation and 
 4 
 
autoimmunity to limit disease by deletional effects on effector T cells and by promoting cohorts 
of CD4 T cells with regulatory properties, including those that secrete IL-10 (15). One ASI 
approach involves administration of short peptides, representing epitopes of disease-related 
autoantigens. This strategy, termed peptide immunotherapy (PIT), has gained considerable 
traction in clinical allergy, where it avoids the problem of using whole antigens that might 
trigger IgE-mediated hypersensitivity; and it is also under development in autoimmune 
inflammatory conditions such as coeliac disease and multiple sclerosis (15). We have previously 
described how administration of a peptide representing an immunodominant region of 
proinsulin presented by the HLA class II diabetes-risk molecule HLA-DR4 (DRB1*0401) can 
modulate autoreactive CD4 T cells in patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes, but in that 
study circulating C-peptide was absent, and therefore safety and disease-modifying effects in a 
clinically relevant target population could not be evaluated (16). In the present study, 
therefore, we examined the proinsulin mono-peptide immunotherapy approach in adults 
ascertained within 100 days of type 1 diabetes diagnosis and with residual C-peptide in order to 
examine safety and tolerability in a relevant therapeutic setting, and study early indications of 
mechanistic and metabolic effects. 
 
Results  
Study enrolment and randomization 
Of the 233 patients referred to the study sites, 84 were assessed for eligibility and attended 
screening visits. Of these, 56 subjects either did not possess the HLA-DRB1*0401 genotype or 
autoantibodies and 1 subject had stimulated C-peptide <0.2 nmol/L; all were excluded 
(Supplementary Figure S1). After 24 subjects had been randomized, subjects who did not 
complete a minimum of 11 out of 12 treatments (n=1 in the low frequency and n=2 in the high 
frequency groups) were replaced with additional study subjects (n=2 in the low frequency and 
n=1 in the high frequency groups by randomization) to maximize information on treatment 
exposure, but all subjects (n=27) were retained in the analysis. Four subjects missed follow-up 
assessments (n=3 in the low frequency and n=1 in the high frequency groups; two subjects 
 5 
 
declined these visits and two subjects were lost to follow-up). Baseline characteristics are 
shown in Table 1 and did not differ between groups, except for HbA1c which was significantly 
higher in the placebo group compared with high frequency group (p=0.02). Planned primary 
and secondary endpoints are shown in Supplementary Table 1. 
 
Safety of proinsulin peptide C19-A3 in new onset type 1 diabetes 
Subjects enrolled were treated according to the regime in Figure 1 and the participant flow is 
summarized in Supplementary Figure S1. Peptide injection was very well tolerated with no 
serious advents events considered to be treatment emergent and there was no evidence of 
hypersensitivity reactions at any time during the treatment course. Local erythematous skin 
reactions without local wheal or swelling have been observed previously with this peptide (16) 
and were seen in 8/9, 10/10, 4/8 subjects in the high frequency, low frequency and placebo 
groups, respectively, but did not change in quality or size over time.  
 
C-peptide changes during the study 
 
As specified in the pre-determined analysis plan, C-peptide AUC was compared between the 
treatment groups over time (3, 6, 9 and 12 months) by multilevel model repeated measures 
(MMRM) analysis adjusted for baseline value of AUC, and no significant treatment-related 
effects were observed. Importantly, there was no evidence of accelerated C-peptide loss in the 
treated groups compared to placebo.  
However, we noted differences in C-peptide changes during the study which are worthy of 
discussion. The decline in stimulated C-peptide was different between study groups, and at the 
3 month timepoint mean loss of C-peptide in the placebo group exceeded that of the high 
frequency (p=0.03) and low frequency groups (Figure 2A). This difference in C-peptide decline 
was evident in individual data plots (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 2): compared with 
baseline, C-peptide levels in subjects receiving placebo showed a decline at every timepoint in 
every subject (apart from one subject, at 6, 9 and 12 months) and mean values declined 
significantly in paired analyses compared to baseline. This contrasted with findings in the 
 6 
 
treatment groups, in which the mean percent change was more modest, fewer individual 
subjects showed actual loss of C-peptide, and significant changes in mean values were only 
seen when comparing baseline with 12 month levels in the high frequency group. Thus in this 
study, patients on placebo manifest an early decline of measurable C-peptide production, 
whilst this is not seen during administration of proinsulin C19-A3 peptide injections. 
 
 
Changes in insulin use and HbA1c  
 
Other potential effects of proinsulin peptide immunotherapy on metabolic responses were 
assessed by changes in insulin use during the study. Mean change in average insulin dose 
(unit/kg/day) showed a progressive rise in subjects in the placebo arm (Figure 3A and 
Supplementary Tables 3-4). In contrast, there was no significant change in average insulin dose 
in the high and low frequency arms of the study. As a result, mean changes in insulin use were 
significantly lower in the high frequency arm at 6, 9 and 12 months (p=0.03, p=0.04 and p=0.01, 
respectively) and significantly lower in the low frequency arm at 12 months (p=0.009) 
compared with placebo, with an overall difference between the treatment and placebo groups 
across all time points in multilevel model repeated measures analysis (p = 0.01). 
The study was designed to manage glycaemic control intensively with a target HbA1c of less 
than 48mmol/mol (6.5%). Differences in HbA1c between study groups would not be expected, 
therefore, and significant changes were not seen; however, there was a trend for increased 
HbA1c levels in the placebo group and in the treatment groups initial trends for values to 
decline and then stabilize/increase after 6 months (Figure 3B and Supplementary Tables 5-6). 
To examine the combined impact of changes in HbA1c and insulin usage on metabolic control, 
we examined the insulin dose adjusted HbA1c (IDAA1c) according to the formula of Mortensen 
et al (17). IDAA1c increased over 12 months in the placebo group (p=0.04; Figure 3C), 
consistent with a decline in endogenous insulin production, but was maintained at baseline 
levels in the intervention groups, consistent with C-peptide preservation. 
 7 
 
 
Proinsulin:C-peptide ratio, autoantibodies and T cell responses according to treatment group 
and responder/non-responders. 
 
We examined additional markers representing β-cell stress and effector, regulatory, functional 
and phenotypic features of global and antigen-specific adaptive immune responses. Over the 
duration of the treatment period, cumulative CD4 T cell IL-10 responses to proinsulin 
stimulation were significantly higher in the blood of the high frequency compared with placebo 
(p=0.015) and low frequency groups (p=0.003; Figure 4A). There were no significant differences 
in CD4 T cell IFN-γ responses to proinsulin, circulating subsets of regulatory T cells (Tregs) or 
activated CD8 T cells specific for β-cell target peptides between these groups. 
 
To provide further mechanistic insight, analyses were also performed on subjects divided 
according to the approach validated by Beam et al. (18) in which response to treatment is 
defined as a post-baseline value that is 100% or more of the baseline value of C-peptide AUC.  
There were 10 such “C-peptide responder” subjects identifiable during the treatment period (6 
months), 1 in the placebo group, 6 in the low frequency and 3 in the high frequency groups. C-
peptide responders were significantly more frequent in the low frequency group than in the 
placebo group at 3 months (p=0.03). To examine whether peptide-treated C-peptide 
responders/non-responders differ by additional metabolic markers, we measured the 
proinsulin/C-peptide ratio during the MMTT, high levels of which are an indicator of β-cell 
stress. We observed that both fasting and 90-minute proinsulin/C-peptide ratio are significantly 
higher compared to baseline at multiple timepoints in peptide-treated C-peptide non-
responders (Figure 5A,C). No change over time was observed in peptide-treated C-peptide 
responders, consistent with there being less β-cell stress in this group (Figure 5B,D).  
 
We next measured immune changes in peptide-treated C-peptide responders/non-responders. 
We found a statistically-significant difference between these groups at some of the months 
(p=0.0029). Higher levels of IL-10 responses appear to have been maintained in the responder 
group. Subsequent Bonferroni-adjusted, month-wise testing indicates that at 2 months, IL-10 
 8 
 
responses against PI were specifically, significantly higher in peptide-treated C-peptide 
responders (p=0.007) (Figure 4B and Supplementary Table 7). Peptide-treated C-peptide 
responders (but not non-responders) showed a trend for IFN-γ response levels against PI to 
decline between starting therapy and the first assay performed at 1 month (p=0.08) (Figure 4C).   
Extending these studies to the high-dimensional analysis of Tregs, we noted an increase in 
levels of Treg expression of FoxP3, the master transcriptional regulator of these cells, during the 
treatment period (between baseline and 6 months) in peptide-treated C-peptide responders 
(Figure 4D). Levels returned to baseline at 12 months and were unchanged throughout the 
study in peptide-treated C-peptide non-responders. Of interest, the greatest fold-change in 
FoxP3 expression was seen in CD45RA- (memory) Treg sub-populations that lacked Helios 
expression, especially those co-expressing CD39 (Figure 4E-F). In contrast, levels of Helios 
expression by Tregs did not change in either study group (Figure 4G). The proportion of CD8 T 
cells specific for β-cells that expressed the disease-associated activated (CD57+) effector 
memory phenotype was significantly lower in treated C-peptide responders compared to 
placebo and non-responders at baseline, and remained lower than placebo at 6 months (Figure 
4H). As observed in our previous studies in new onset type 1 diabetes patients, T cell responses 
to C19-A3 at baseline were present in a small minority of patients; significant treatment and 
responder-related changes were not observed. There were no treatment- or response-related 
changes in autoantibodies or ELISPOT responses to the control recall antigen. 
 
Discussion  
The principle that simple administration of antigens that are targeted in inflammatory diseases 
such as autoimmunity and allergy can have a therapeutic benefit has been borne out by many 
robust studies in preclinical models, as well as by more recent indications of success in the clinic 
(15, 19-21). Our group has developed a distinctive approach to this in type 1 diabetes, through 
HLA-guided identification of naturally processed and presented epitopes of major autoantigens 
such as proinsulin, that can be developed for PIT (8, 22). The current Phase Ib study was 
designed to explore safety (notably the risks of hypersensitivity and acceleration of loss of β-cell 
function) and examine immunological effects of repeated dosing with such a native peptide 
 9 
 
sequence at the point of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. We find that this approach is very well 
tolerated by patients even with dosing every 2 weeks for 6 months with no evidence of 
development of hypersensitivity.  
Importantly, we also find no evidence for accelerated loss of C-peptide secretion as an indicator 
of augmented β-cell damage. Early C-peptide loss after diagnosis was apparent and significant 
in the placebo group, but much less so in either of the treated groups and C-peptide loss was 
significantly lower in the high frequency group at 3 months.  These results should be viewed 
with caution because C-peptide measurements can be variable, there were small numbers of 
subjects in each group with some imbalance between groups in baseline metabolic data (Table 
1), and the study was not powered to examine efficacy which would require many more 
subjects. However, patients receiving proinsulin PIT showed stable daily insulin use, compared 
with rising use in the placebo group. Stable insulin use in the treatment groups was not 
associated with poorer glycemic control; insulin adjusted HbA1c levels fell or stabilized, 
compared with an overall increase in the placebo group. Both treatment groups (high and low 
frequency) showed similar behavior in relation to C-peptide, insulin use, HbA1c stabilization, 
consistent with a treatment effect. While more frequent dosing was also safe, it did not appear 
to confer additional effects.  
In exploratory analyses, we used validated criteria (18) to define a group of clinical responders 
by their retention of stimulated C-peptide secretion during the treatment period and found 
such subjects to be enriched in the peptide-treated groups. It is noteworthy that these peptide-
treated C-peptide responders/non-responders also differed according to changes in 
proinsulin:C-peptide (PI:C) ratio during the study. Under normal conditions, very small amounts 
of proinsulin are secreted, but stressed β-cells release more relative to mature insulin/C-
peptide, due to endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction (23). Thus the circulating PI:C ratio is a 
measure of β-cell stress, typically showing a rise shortly after diagnosis (24, 25) followed by 
reduction later in the disease (26). Our data can be interpreted as indicating that peptide-
treated C-peptide responders have less β-cell stress compared to non-responders. 
Heterogeneity of response to treatment has been recognized in other intervention studies in 
type 1 diabetes, and understanding its underlying basis is important for maximizing therapeutic 
 10 
 
effects. Differences in the T cell response to proinsulin according to treatment group were also 
observed over the course of the current study, and there was a trend for several important 
differences in immunological responsiveness to emerge between responder/non-responder 
groups. First, in relation to immune regulation, we observed a higher level of IL-10 responses to 
proinsulin in association with high frequency treatment and trends for higher IL-10 responses in 
peptide-treated responders.  There have been numerous reports that ASI and PIT induce IL-10 
responses, and that this is a key component of the therapeutic mechanism, although other 
mechanisms, including effects on conventional FoxP3+CD25high Tregs have also been observed 
in preclinical models (21). Linked to this, our finding of a higher fold-change in Treg expression 
of FoxP3 in peptide-treated responders is of considerable interest, since it was most marked in 
a population of memory Tregs co-expressing CD39, which is associated with controlling 
inflammation via IL-10 secretion (27). Moreover, the memory subsets markedly upregulating 
FoxP3 expression were Helios-negative, suggesting that they are peripherally-generated, 
adaptive Tregs arising post-treatment. It is proposed that autoantigen-specific CD4 T cells with 
immunoregulatory properties are induced and suppress bystander inflammatory responses to 
the same epitope, autoantigen or related autoantigens being presented in cis by the same 
antigen-presenting cell (APCs) (14). In an extension of this effect, there is also evidence that 
under these conditions APCs are licensed to induce new cohorts of regulatory T cells 
(“infectious tolerance”) (28). It is tempting to speculate that administration of C19-A3 has 
resulted in the generation of IL-10+ proinsulin-specific CD4 T cells and/or adaptive Tregs 
through infectious tolerance and that this response is causally related to the C-peptide 
retention observed in selected subjects. Why some subjects should respond whilst others do 
not is a common conundrum of the immunotherapy field.  We have previously shown that a 
distinguishing feature of type 1 diabetes is the presence of circulating β-cell-specific effector 
memory CD8 T cells that show evidence (CD57 expression) of recent antigen exposure (29). We 
found that baseline levels of this subset were low in treated C-peptide responders, raising the 
intriguing possibility that patients with restricted activation of autoreactive cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes represent a disease stratum that is more permissive to the immune regulatory 
effects inducible by PIT. 
 11 
 
Our study extends experience with ASI and PIT in type 1 diabetes, and cements the view that it 
has a very favorable safety profile, especially by comparison with biologic agents that carry the 
risk of acute toxicities such as cytokine storm and circulatory compromise, as well as chronic 
effects such as increased infection risk. The safety signal in PIT is coupled with strong evidence 
against any deleterious effect on β-cell function. In combination, these two features make this 
an appealing strategy for prevention, both in Stage 1 disease (defined as the presymptomatic 
presence of β-cell autoimmunity evidenced by two or more islet autoantibodies with 
normoglycaemia) and in those identified early in life as being at high genetic risk (30). In 
summary, our study demonstrates that PIT using proinsulin peptide appears safe and well 
tolerated, even when administered over several months and during the auto-inflammatory 
process that is associated with the immediate period following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. 
Two-weekly dosing does not appear to confer any benefit over 4-weekly dosing. Future studies 
will need to be powered for efficacy, should examine whether children are similarly responsive, 
and begin to explore opportunities for prevention.  
 
Materials and Methods 
Study design 
A schematic representation of this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled phase 1b 
study is shown in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1. Five UK centres screened a total of 84 
patients. Inclusion criteria were: age 18-45 years; <100 days from diagnosis of type 1 diabetes 
(dated from day of first insulin injection); HLA DRB1*0401 genotype; islet autoantibody 
positivity (one of glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADAb), insulinoma-associated 
antigen-2 antibody (IA-2Ab) or zinc transporter 8 antibody (ZnT8Ab)) and stimulated C-peptide 
>0.2nmol/L at any point during a 2 hour MMTT. Main exclusion criteria were use of 
immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies; immunization with live or killed 
vaccinations or allergic desensitization procedures less than 1 month prior to first treatment; 
 12 
 
recent participation in other research trials of immunomodulatory agents, pregnancy and 
breast-feeding.  
The three group study design aimed to provide at least 16 patients on active treatment and 8 
subjects in the placebo group to achieve sufficient data to inform future study designs and 
future sample size calculations. The study was not intended to show a statistically significant 
difference between the control and treatment groups and was not powered to do so. Twenty-
seven subjects were randomised into 3 groups: high frequency (n=9, who received 10μg 
proinsulin C19-A3 peptide every 2 weeks), low frequency (n=10, 10μg proinsulin C19-A3 every 4 
weeks) or placebo (n=8, 50μl 0.9% saline every 2 weeks). To ensure subject and physician 
blinding, the low frequency group received 0.9% saline injections at 2-week intervals between 
peptide dosing. C19-A3 or saline was delivered as a 50μl intradermal injection in the upper arm.  
Subjects received a total of 12 injections over a 6 month period followed by a 6 month 
observation period. Patients were routinely monitored for a minimum of 1 hour after each 
injection for acute adverse effects. Glycaemic control was intensively managed in all subjects 
with a target HbA1c of less than 48mmol/mol (6.5%), with a record of average total daily insulin 
use in the previous 2 days documented at each visit.  
Proinsulin C19-A3 peptide (GSLQPLALEGSLQKRGIV) was manufactured to Good Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP) standards by the Interdivisional GMP-Facility of Leiden University Medical 
Center (Leiden, the Netherlands) and prepared and supplied as lyophilized peptide by Nova 
Laboratories (Leicester, UK). 
Laboratory measures of haematological indices, liver function, thyroid stimulating hormone, 
urea, creatinine, calcium, lipid levels and immunoglobulin levels were performed at baseline, 3, 
6, 9 and 12 months.  Any local skin reactions to dose administration were monitored until 
resolving and <1cm in diameter. Safety data were under regular review by an independent Data 
Safety Monitoring Board.  
Primary endpoint was assessment of the safety of proinsulin C19-A3 peptide administration; 
secondary endpoints were assessments of changes in i) stimulated C-peptide production after 
MMTT (measured as area under the curve as previously described (31)); ii) level or quality of T 
 13 
 
lymphocyte biomarkers of β-cell specific immune response, iii) level or quality of islet cell 
autoantibody biomarkers of β-cell specific immune response and iv) insulin use and HbA1c, at 3, 
6, 9 and 12 months versus baseline and between groups.

Immunological and metabolic assays  
Analysis of autoreactive pro-inflammatory (interferon-γ+ (IFN-γ+)) and regulatory (interleukin-
10+, (IL-10+)) CD4 T cells was carried out by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay using 
fresh heparinized blood obtained at 1st injection and monthly thereafter until the last assay was 
performed 2 weeks after the last injection. Samples were coded to blind the laboratory as to 
dosing regimen. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; 106) were cultured with study 
drug (proinsulin C19-A3 peptide 10μg/ml, recombinant human proinsulin (Biomm, Brazil; 
10μg/ml), Pediacel (pentavalent vaccine comprising pertussis, diphtheria, Haemophilus 
influenza B, polio and tetanus toxoid vaccines; Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Maidenhead, UK; 1μl/ml) or 
control diluent for 48 hours and cytokine secretion measured by indirect assay (U-CyTech, 
Utrecht, the Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data are expressed as 
the mean number of spots per triplicate and compared with the mean spot number in the 
presence of diluent alone (stimulation index; SI). The assay has significant discriminative ability 
for type 1 diabetes in blinded proficiency testing (32) and inter-assay coefficient of variation for 
the spot number for both the IFN-γ and IL-10 assays were 12.3% and 10.7%, respectively. 
GADAb, IA-2Ab and ZnT8Ab were measured by ELISA (RSR Ltd, Cardiff, UK) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Stimulated C-peptide was measured using mixed meal tolerance 
 14 
 
tests at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months (31). Briefly, Ensure Plus® was administered at 6ml/kg to 
fasting patients and serum C-peptide levels analyzed using a two-site chemiluminescent assay 
(Invitron, Monmouth, UK) at -10, 0, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes.  
Immunophenotyping of Tregs was performed on cryopreserved PBMCs at baseline, 6 and 12 
months in batches (each comprising all 3 visit samples from 4 subjects selected at random). 
Thawed PBMCs were live/dead blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific, London, UK) and then surface 
stained using anti-CD4-APC-Cy7 (RPA-T4), anti-CD25-PE (2A3 and M-A251), anti-CD27-BV605 
(L128), anti-CD39-PE-Cy7 (A1; BioLegend), anti-CD45RA-PE-CF594 (HI100), anti-CD278-BV711 
(DX29) and anti-HLA-DR-BV786 (G46-6; all BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK unless specified) and 
intracellularly stained using anti-Ki67-FITC (B56; BD), anti-FOXP3-Alexa Fluor 647 (259D/C7; BD 
Biosciences) and anti-Helios-Pacific blue (22F6; BioLegend, San Diego) for data acquisition using 
a BD Biosciences LSR Fortessa. Each data file was randomly subsampled to 12,500 Treg cells and 
scaled using inverse hyperbolic sine (arcsinh) transformation with a cofactor of 150. 
Automated, unsupervised clustering analysis with Euclidean distance metric and k = 100 was 
performed for CD25, CD45RA, CD27, HLA-DR, CD39, ICOS, Ki67, FOXP3 and Helios using the 
Phenograph algorithm (33), identifying 20 clusters. Where indicated, independent analysis of 
manually gated populations was also performed.  
CD57+ (antigen-experienced) effector memory β-cell peptide-specific CD8 T cells were detected 
using peptide-HLA-A*0201 tetramers loaded with preproinsulin 15-24, insulin B chain 10-18, 
and IA-2 797-805 as previously described (29) and expressed as a percentage of the parent 
tetramer population. Identical populations of CD8 T cells specific for common viral peptides 
CMVpp65 495-503, EBV BMLF-1 280-288 and influenza matrix 58-66 were measured as 
controls.  
For calculation of the proinsulin/C-peptide ratio, serum analytes were measured by 
chemiluminescence (Invitron Ltd, UK). 
Calculation of insulin dose adjusted HbA1c 
 15 
 
Insulin dose adjusted HbA1c (IDAA1c) is a surrogate measure of β-cell function (17) and is 
calculated according to the following formula: HbA1c (%) + [4 × insulin dose (units per kilogram 
per day)]. 
 
Statistical Analysis 
For analysis of metabolic changes, comparisons against baseline and between treatment groups 
were made initially using multilevel model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis adjusted for 
baseline value for all data points, followed by exploratory analyses using Student’s t-tests for 
paired and unpaired samples; Mann-Whitney U test; Wilcoxon matched pairs test which were 
also used for immune marker comparisons. For analysis of immune changes detected by 
ELISPOT analysis over the treatment period, longitudinal measurements of the SI were 
transformed using the natural logarithm (“Ln”) and were analyzed with linear models having 
visit and treatment as main factors and a repeated measures error structure. Estimates of the 
mean SI across visits were computed using model-based estimates (“Least Squares Means”). 
These statistical analyses were conducted with SAS V9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For 
comparison of Treg cluster frequencies and mean expression levels between groups and 
timepoints one-way ANOVA analysis with Tukey post hoc correction was performed in 
MATLAB® R2016b. P values <0.05 were considered significant.

Figure 1 Legend. Study design and treatment groups. 
Graphical representation of study design shows timing of treatments and evaluation of 
stimulated C-peptide. Enrolled subjects were allocated randomly with double blinding to 
receive placebo (saline injections every 2 weeks), high (10μg proinsulin C19-A3 peptide every 2 
weeks), or low (10μg proinsulin C19-A3 peptide every 4 weeks alternating with saline every 4 
weeks) frequency active treatment by intradermal injection for a total of 12 administrations 
over 6 months. Residual C-peptide production was evaluated at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 
months thereafter.  
 
Figure 2 Legend. Changes in C-peptide.  
A. Natural Log of mean change in normalised mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) stimulated 
AUC C-peptide from baseline is shown in groups receiving placebo (open squares), low 
(triangle) and high (inverted triangle) frequency C19-A3 peptide over 12 months. There was 
decline in stimulated C-peptide in the placebo arm; the change at 3 months significantly 
exceeded that in the high frequency arm (*; p=0.03). Error bars represent standard error of the 
mean. B. Change in normalised MMTT stimulated AUC C-peptide values from baseline versus 
level at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in groups receiving placebo (open squares), low (triangle) and 
high (inverted triangle) frequency C19-A3 peptide over 12 months. There is a significant 
reduction in the stimulated C-peptide level in the placebo group at each time point. No 
significant decline was seen in the low and high frequency groups during the treatment phase; 
during follow-up a significant change in the high frequency group was seen at 12 months 
compared to baseline. Comparisons were made using paired t-tests. The mean % change was 
calculated at each time point for each study group.  
 
Figure 3 Legend. Changes in insulin use and HbA1c.  
A. Mean change in average insulin dose from baseline is shown in groups receiving placebo 
(open squares), low (triangle) and high (inverted triangle) frequency C19-A3 peptide over 12 
 22 
 
months. There was a progressive increase in insulin requirement in the placebo arm. In contrast 
there was a reduction or stabilization in the low and high frequency groups, with significant 
differences in change compared with placebo in the high frequency group at month 6 (*; 
p=0.03), month 9 (*; p=0.04) and month 12 (*p=0.01) and low frequency group at month 12 (†; 
p=0.009). Error bars indicate standard deviations. B. Mean change in HbA1c from baseline is 
shown in groups receiving placebo (open squares), low (triangle) and high (inverted triangle) 
frequency C19-A3 peptide over 12 months. There were no significant changes within groups 
and no significant differences between groups. C. Insulin dose adjusted HbA1c (IDAA1c) values 
following treatment were significantly lower in the high frequency arm at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 
12 months (*p=0.02, p=0.001, p=0.003, p=0.01 and p=0.002, respectively) and significantly 
lower in the low frequency arm at 6 and 12 months (†p=0.05 and p=0.01, respectively) 
compared with placebo. IDAA1c values increased in the placebo group during the study and 
were significantly higher at 12 months compared with baseline (‡p=0.04). Error bars indicate 
standard deviations. 
 
 
Figure 4. Analysis of T cell responses according to treatment and in peptide-treated C-peptide 
responders and non-responders.   
A. CD4 T cell IL-10 responses to proinsulin stimulation were significantly higher in the blood of 
the high frequency (open bars) compared with placebo (filled bars; *p=0.015) and low 
frequency groups (hatched bars; †p=0.003) whilst IFN-γ responses were not different between 
treatment groups. B. In relation to treatment response, across the treatment period IL-10 
responses to proinsulin stimulation (after adjusting for baseline) were different between C-
peptide responder/non-responder groups at some visits (p=0.0029) and rose and, specifically, 
were significantly higher in the peptide-treated C-peptide responder group compared with non-
responders at month 2 (p=0.007).  (C) Peptide-treated C-peptide responders (but not non-
responders) showed a trend for IFN-γ response levels against PI to decline between starting 
therapy and the first assay performed at 1 month (*p=0.08), however no significant difference 
was determined overall (p=0.3385). Bars and symbols represent mean stimulation index at each 
 23 
 
timepoint and error bars are the 95% confidence intervals. (D) In peptide-treated C-peptide 
responders expression levels (MFI, mean fluorescence intensity) of FoxP3 across all Treg 
subsets increased significantly between baseline and 6 months compared with non-responders, 
in whom levels did not change. (E) The most notable change in FoxP3 expression levels was 
seen in memory (CD45RA-) adaptive Tregs (Helios-negative), (F) especially those expressing 
CD39. (G) Helios expression by Tregs did not change in the same period. (H) Antigen-
experienced (CD57+) CD8 T cells stained with peptide-HLA tetramers loaded with β-cell 
peptides were significantly lower at baseline in peptide-treated C-peptide responders, 
compared with placebo and non-responder subjects and remained different to placebo at 6 
months.  Error bars show mean and SEM. Panels B-H include C-peptide responders/non-
responders defined as having a post-baseline value that is 100% or more of the baseline value 
of C-peptide AUC during the treatment period.  There were 9 peptide-treated C-peptide 
responder and 10 non-responder subjects (6/3 in the low frequency and 3/7 in the high 
frequency groups).

Supplementary Table 1. Trial primary and secondary endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
 
• 
Assessment of the safety of C19-A3 peptide administration in 
subjects with new-onset Type 1 diabetes. 
Secondary endpoints 
 
• 
Change in stimulated C-peptide production at 3, 6, 9 and 12 
months versus baseline and between groups. 
• 
Change in level or quality of T lymphocyte biomarkers of β-cell 
specific immune response at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months versus baseline and 
between groups. 
• 
Change in level or quality of islet cell autoantibody biomarkers 
of β-cell specific immune response at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months versus 
baseline and between groups. 
• 
Change in glycated haemoglobin (as measured by % HbA1c 
levels), daily insulin usage, and mean amplitude of glucose excursions1 
at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months versus baseline and between groups.

Supplementary Figure S1. Enrolment, randomization and follow-up of study subjects. 
Between January 2012 and March 2014, a total of 233 subjects were identified and referred to the study 
sites. Out of the 233 subjects, 84 attended screening visits. Fifty-seven out of 84 subjects were excluded 
from the study: 42 did not possess HLA-DRB1*0401 genotype, 6 subjects lacked autoantibodies; 1 subject 
had a stimulated C-peptide level <0.2 nmol/L and 8 lacked the HLA-DRB1*0401 genotype and 
autoantibodies. Twenty-seven subjects were randomized in 3 study arms and 24 subjects completed all 
study assessments.
