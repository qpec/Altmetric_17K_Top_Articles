T
he Criminal Code of Canada’s prohibitions on medical assis-
tance in dying have been lifted.1 The logistics of offering 
medical assistance in dying to Canadians need to be formal-
ized, and the consequences of this practice need to be anticipated. 
As with any new medical intervention, understanding the clinical 
and costing implications of medical assistance in dying is important.
Health care costs increase substantially among patients nearing 
the end of life, accounting for a disproportionate amount of health 
care spending. For example, in Manitoba, more than 20% of health 
care costs  are attributable to patients within the 6 months before 
dying, despite their representing only 1% of the population.2 Fur-
thermore, as death approaches, health care costs increase dramati-
cally in the final months.3,4 Patients who choose medical assistance 
in dying may forego this resource-intensive period.
In a 1998 special article in The New England Journal of Medicine, 
Emanuel and Battin predicted that legalizing medical assistance in 
dying in the United States would save hundreds of millions of 
health care dollars per year;5 a similar model can be applied to Can-
ada. Here, we combine data on the use of medical assistance in 
dying from countries where it is legal with Canadian-specific end-
of-life cost data to estimate the effect of this intervention on health 
care costs in Canada.
Methods
Emanuel and Battin’s model relies on 3 main factors to estimate 
cost savings from medical assistance in dying: the number of 
patients expected to choose the intervention; the effect of the inter-
vention on life expectancy; and the total health care costs associ-
ated with end-of-life care.5 We updated their model to include more 
recent and detailed demographic estimates of the patients who 
may choose medical assistance in dying, including age, sex and 
underlying diagnosis, in addition to Canadian-specific cost data.
Proportion of deaths due to medical assistance  
in dying and patient demographics
Between 1990 and 2012, medical assistance in dying accounted 
for an estimated 1.8%–3.3% of total deaths in the Netherlands, 
with a trend for an increase in rates over the last 25 years.6,7 In 
Belgium, medical assistance in dying has accounted for between

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The legalization of med-
ical assistance in dying will affect health 
care spending in Canada. Our aim was 
to determine the potential costs and 
savings associated with the implemen-
tation of medical assistance in dying.
METHODS: Using published data from 
the Netherlands and Belgium, where 
medically assisted death is legal, we 
estimated that medical assistance in 
dying will account for 1%–4% of all 
deaths; 80% of patients will have can-
cer; 50% of patients will be aged 60–80 
years; 55% will be men; 60% of patients 
will have their lives shortened by 1 
month; and 40% of patients will have 
their lives shortened by 1  week. We 
combined current mortality data for the 
Canadian population with recent end-
of-life cost data to calculate a predicted 
range of savings associated with the 
implementation of medical assistance 
in dying. We also estimated the direct 
costs associated with offering medically 
assisted death, including physician con-
sultations and drug costs.
RESULTS: Medical assistance in dying 
could reduce annual health care spend-
ing across Canada by between $34.7 mil-
lion and $138.8 million, exceeding the 
$1.5–$14.8 million in direct costs associ-
ated with its implementation. In sensitiv-
ity analyses, we noted that even if the 
potential savings are overestimated and 
costs underestimated, the implementa-
tion of mdedical assistance in dying will 
likely remain at least cost neutral.
INTERPRETATION: Providing medical 
assistance in dying in Canada should not 
result in any excess financial burden to 
the health care system, and could result 
in substantial savings. Additional data on 
patients who choose medical assistance 
in dying in Canada should be collected to 
enable more precise estimates of the 
impact of medically assisted death on 
health care spending and to enable fur-
ther economic evaluation.

0.3% and 4.6% of all deaths, with the highest rates documented 
in the most recent 2013 survey.8,9 Based on these numbers, we 
estimated that medical assistance in dying will eventually play a 
role in 1%–4% of all deaths in  
Canada.
Several individual studies, in addition to a recent systematic 
review, have shown that medical assistance in dying is most 
commonly chosen by men, by patients in their 7th and 8th 
decade of life and by patients with cancer.6,10,11 Based on these 
previous data, we assumed that 55% of patients choosing the 
intervention will be male, that 50% of patients will be aged 
60–79 years, 30% will be aged 18–59 years and 20% will be 80 
years and older, and that 80% of patients will have cancer.
Impact on life expectancy
A 2010 physician survey from the Netherlands estimated that 40% 
of cases of medical assistance in dying were associated with a 
reduction in life expectancy of less than 1 week, and 60% were 
associated with a reduction of more than 1 week (no upper time 
limit provided).6 Thus, we predicted that about 40% of Canadians 
who choose medical assistance in dying will have their lives short-
ened by 1 week, and 60% of patients will have their lives shortened 
by 1 month.
Cost of end-of-life care
With the collaboration of the authors (and after ethics approval), 
previously published costing data from the province of Ontario3 
were re 
analyzed into the relevant subgroups for our model. 
Briefly, total health care costs for all decedents in Ontario be-
tween Apr. 1, 2010, and Mar. 31, 2013 (n = 264 755), were mea-
sured using administrative data. These costs were calculated at 
an individual patient level on a cumulative daily basis, which 
 
allowed for weekly and monthly costs preceding death to be de-
termined. Costs included those associated with acute care (emer-
gency department visits and hospital admissions), out 
patient 
care (physician billing, outpatient clinics [including dialysis and 
cancer care], laboratory services and select drug or device ex-
penses) and continuing care (long-term care, complex continuing 
care, rehabilitation and home care). Additional details are avail-
able in the original publication.3
We excluded deaths from “external causes” (accident, poison-
ing, assault, drowning, and complications of medical care, as 
defined by  International Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems, 10th revision [ICD-10], codes). Patients 
were considered to have cancer if they had 1 hospital admission 
with a discharge diagnosis or 2 outpatient visits with an ICD-10 
billing code of neoplasm in their final 2 years of life. We created 
subgroups according to sex and age, as defined previously, and 
calculated the average total cost of health care use in the final 
month and final week of life for each subgroup.
Estimating potential savings associated with medical 
assistance in dying
We assumed 268 056 total deaths annually in Canada based on 
Statistics Canada figures for the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 
2015.12 We ran 4 iterations of our model in which medical assis-
tance in dying accounted for 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% of total deaths. 
We used the total number of cases to derive the number of 
patients in each subgroup using the assumptions described 
previously.
We then multiplied the number of cases in each subgroup by 
the mean total cost of either the final week or final month of life 
associated with that subgroup. We combined the total cost asso-
ciated with each subgroup to estimate the potential cost savings 
in a given year associated with medical assistance in dying.
Effect on costs with the assumption that patients selected 
palliative care
Our base-case model uses mean costs for all decedent sub-
groups, which can be interpreted as the cost associated with 
standard end-of-life care across a variety of scenarios and 
patient wishes. It is possible that patients who request medical 
assistance in dying would choose a less aggressive palliative care 
approach. Because a previous review suggested that palliative 
care reduces end-of-life health care costs by 40%–70% com-
pared with standard care,13 we conducted 2 additional analyses 
in which we reduced the cost of care preceding death by 40% 
and 70%.
Additional sensitivity analyses
We conducted additional sensitivity analyses using our base-case 
analysis (assuming 1% of decedents select medical assistance in 
dying) varying our assumptions regarding sex, age group, cancer 
status and effect on life expectancy. The variations we modelled 
included 30%–70% of cases involving male patients, 50%–100% 
of cases involving cancer patients, equal division of cases among 
the 3 age groups, and plausible variations in the proportion of 
patients who may have their life expectancy reduced by 1 month 
as opposed to 1 week.
Estimating the costs associated with implementing 
medical assistance in dying
There is no standardized approach to medical assistance in 
dying yet in Canada, and each case will have unique patient 
and provider elements, which makes estimating the costs asso-
ciated with this service difficult. Acknowledging this, we esti-
mated the direct costs of offering medical assistance in dying 
within a fee-for-service setting, understanding that there will 
have to be 2 independent assessments for patient eligibility,14 
and that medications chosen by the physician involved will be 
administered at a separate visit after being prepared by a phar-
macy. Therefore,  each case will include at least 2 physician 
claims for a consultation, 1 claim for a follow-up visit where the 
medication is administered, the cost of the drugs in addition to 
pharmacy preparation time and 1 claim for completion of the 
death certificate. To keep costs consistent and comparable 
with our end-of-life costing analysis, we used Ontario physician 
fees in our calculations.15 Although there is no standard drug 
regimen for medical assistance in dying across Canada, we had 
confidential access to the drug regimens suggested in Alberta 
(including an anxiolytic, local anesthetic, sedative and para-
lytic), as well as the associated costs. Costs for these alternate 
regimens varied between $25 and $326 per case. We assumed

E103
an additional $30 of pharmacist time (about 30 min of time to 
prepare and dispense the drugs based on a mean pharmacist 
wage of $60/h, including benefits16). 
We created 2 base-case scenarios, a low-cost scenario in 
which the assessments are performed by primary care physicians 
and the least costly drug regimen is used, and a high-cost sce-
nario in which the assessments are done by specialists and the 
most costly drug regimen is used (Table 1). In addition, there will 
be patients who request medical assistance in dying and incur 
the 2 assessment fees but do not complete the process, either 
being denied, retracting their request or dying from their disease. 
In the Netherlands, data from a single centre suggests 25% of 
requests for medical assistance in dying are ultimately granted,17 
whereas this proportion is more than 75% in Belgium.18 We chose 
a conservative estimate that 33% of requests in Canada will be 
granted, meaning for every patient receiving medical assistance 
in dying, we added the cost of 2 additional patients who under-
went assessment only.
Results
Table 2 shows the mean health care spending in the final week 
and final month of life that was used to calculate potential cost 
savings for each subgroup. The potential cost of implementing 
medical assistance in dying, and the estimated savings in end-of-
life care associated with the intervention, are shown in Table 3. 
Assuming a low-cost scenario and standard end-of-life care (i.e., 
base-case analysis), we expect that net health care costs would 
be reduced by $33.2 million per year if 1% of deaths are due to 
medical assistance in dying. When end-of-life costs were reduced 
by 40% and 70% with the assumption that a palliative approach 
would have been chosen, net cost savings are reduced to 
$19.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively (Table 3). As noted 
within Table 3, overall health care costs are lower across all sce-
narios considered, even when higher drug and physician costs 
are assumed.
Varying the sex, cancer status and age group of the patients 
across plausible ranges had little effect on the projected savings, 
whereas varying the estimated effect on life expectancy had a 
larger impact on projected savings. For example, if 80% of 
patients have their lives shortened by 1 month (rather than 
1 wk), there would be an additional $5.7 million in health care 
savings, whereas if 80% of patients have their life expectancy 
shortened by only 1 week, the projected savings would be 
reduced by $11.3 million, or more than 30%.

Interpretation
If Canadians adopt medical assistance in dying in a manner and 
extent similar to those of the Netherlands and Belgium, we can 
expect a reduction in health care spending in the range of tens of 
millions of dollars per year. Our analyses suggest that the savings 
will almost certainly exceed the costs associated with offering 
medical assistance in dying to patients across the country, and 
that the inclusion of medical assistance in dying in the services 
covered by universal health care will not increase health care 
spending, but rather will release funds to be reinvested else-
where. We are not suggesting medical assistance in dying as a 
measure to cut costs. At an individual level, neither patients nor 
physicians should consider costs when making the very personal 
decision to request, or provide, this  
intervention.
Strengths and limitations
We used comprehensive Canadian-specific cost data, provided a 
range of potential savings based on projected uptake of medical 
assistance in dying across the country, used more detailed sub-
groupings to create case estimates than in a previously pub-
lished American model,5 and performed extensive sensitivity 
analyses. We provided a preliminary estimate of the direct costs 
of medical assistance in dying in Canada, including the costs of 
requests that are not ultimately granted. 
The main limitation of our model was using data from the 
Netherlands and Belgium to build our case estimates. In Canada, 
only competent adults aged 18 years and older whose “natural 
death has become reasonably foreseeable” will be eligible for 
medical assistance in dying,14 whereas in the Netherlands and Bel-
gium, there are provisions to allow medical assistance in dying for 
patients with nonterminal diseases, minors and patients with 
dementia.19,20 Therefore, we may have overestimated the propor-
tion of total deaths due to medical assistance in dying by using 
statistics from countries with more liberal policies. We did, how-
ever, provide a range of estimates to account for this possibility.
Our cost data were specific to the province of Ontario, and 
may not represent end-of-life spending in all Canadian prov-
inces.3 However, these are the most comprehensive data avail-
able on end-of-life health care costs in Canada, including costs 
across a broader range of services (such as outpatient visits and 
diagnostic investigations) than previous reports.2,4 In addition, 
these cost data are recent and therefore more likely to reflect 
current fee schedules and current standards of care at the end-
of-life, including new treatments. Finally, the costs were calcu-
lated on a daily basis, allowing for the use of weekly and monthly 
subtotals, which were crucial to our model.
It should be noted that our estimates regarding the effect of 
medical assistance in dying on life expectancy were taken from a 
single physician survey.6 Because our sensitivity analyses found this 
variable to have a considerable effect on our results, determining 
how to accurately measure and report this information for Can-
adian cases will be important for future cost analyses.
Our estimates of the costs associated with offering medical 
assistance in dying were based on a very simple model, which pre-
dominantly used Ontario-level costs for consistency. This analysis 
should be updated if and when unique billing codes for the consul-
tations and delivery of medical assistance in dying are developed. 
We did not account for additional potential costs, such as coordina-
tion services. In Alberta, there is a medical assistance in dying coor-
dination team with several full-time employees who respond to 
patient or provider inquiries and assist in liaising patients with will-
ing providers. These are fixed costs, and do not necessarily vary 
with the number of cases, but could be substantial if every province 
adopts this approach. Administrative costs associated with creat-
ing an oversight body or reporting mechanism, as suggested by the

Canadian Medical Association,21 were also not accounted for. Nev-
ertheless, even if these costs were included, it is likely that the 
implementation of medical assistance in dying would be cost neu-
tral or result in cost savings.
Finally, our analysis is only a cost analysis and it does not 
consider the clinical effects of medical assistance in dying on 
patients at the end of life. Patient-level research that explores 
the reasons why Canadians choose medical assistance in dying, 
the value they assign to their suffering versus death and other 
aspects of their experience will need to be done before true eco-
nomic evaluation of medical assistance in dying in terms of cost-
effectiveness and utility can be done.
Conclusion
Our analysis suggests that the provision of medical assistance in 
dying in Canada will be cost neutral or result in a reduction in 
total health care costs, although the true effect on health care 
costs will not be certain until we determine who the typical Cana-
dian patient requesting the intervention is and how its practice is 
implemented across the country. Our study highlights the need to 
prospectively collect certain data to accurately measure the 
effect of this new policy on health care spending, namely the total 
number of patients, in addition to demographics, underlying 
diagnosis and estimated effect on life expectancy.
The implementation of medical assistance in dying is a major 
event in Canadian history. Anticipating, measuring and responding 
to the broad range of effects that may result from this decision 
should be considered the responsibility of physicians, politicians 
and policy-makers alike.
