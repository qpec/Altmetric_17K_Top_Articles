Background: Higher intakes of fruits and vegetables, rich in micronutrients, have been
associated with better mental health. However, cooking or processing may reduce
the availability of these important micronutrients. This study investigated the differential
associations between intake of raw fruits and vegetables, compared to processed
(cooked or canned) fruits and vegetables, and mental health in young adults.
Methods: In a cross-sectional survey design, 422 young adults ages 18–25 (66.1%
female) living in New Zealand and the United States completed an online survey
that assessed typical consumption of raw vs. cooked/canned/processed fruits and
vegetables, negative and positive mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety, negative
mood, positive mood, life satisfaction, and flourishing), and covariates (including
socio-economic status, body mass index, sleep, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol
use).
Results:
Controlling for covariates, raw fruit and vegetable intake (FVI) predicted
reduced depressive symptoms and higher positive mood, life satisfaction, and flourishing;
processed FVI only predicted higher positive mood. The top 10 raw foods related to
better mental health were carrots, bananas, apples, dark leafy greens like spinach,
grapefruit, lettuce, citrus fruits, fresh berries, cucumber, and kiwifruit.
Conclusions: Raw FVI, but not processed FVI, significantly predicted higher mental
health outcomes when controlling for the covariates. Applications include recommending
the consumption of raw fruits and vegetables to maximize mental health benefits.

INTRODUCTION
“You are what you eat” is a well-known adage that is increasingly supported by evidence linking
healthy diets to optimal physical and mental health (Rooney et al., 2013; Robberecht et al., 2017). An
important driver of the relationship between diet and health is high fruit and vegetable intake (FVI)
(Lampe, 1999; Trichopoulou et al., 2003). Fruits and vegetables contain a variety of micronutrients
critical to physical and mental function (Kaplan et al., 2007). Antioxidants such as vitamin C and
carotenoids are said to play a pivotal role in protecting the body against oxidative stress, which is
responsible for the causation and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, chronic inflammatory

Fruit, Vegetables, and Optimal Mental Health
disease, atherosclerosis, some cancers, and some forms of
depression (Byers and Perry, 1992; Irshad and Chaudhuri,
2002; Raison and Miller, 2011). Furthermore, the water-soluble
vitamins (vitamin C, and B vitamins), and certain minerals
(calcium, magnesium, and zinc), are important for optimal
cognitive and emotional functioning (Huskisson et al., 2007;
Kaplan et al., 2007).
There is now good evidence that higher FVI is related to
better mental health. Research has established that people who
eat more fruits and vegetables have a lower incidence of mental
disorders, including lower rates of depression, perceived stress,
and negative mood (Trichopoulou et al., 2003; Mikolajczyk et al.,
2009; Jacka et al., 2010, 2011, 2017; Ford et al., 2013; Gopinath
et al., 2016; Bishwajit et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017). People who
eat more fruits and vegetables also have a higher likelihood of
optimal mental states, such as greater happiness (Lesani et al.,
2016), positive mood (Ford et al., 2013; White et al., 2013),
life satisfaction (Blanchflower et al., 2013; Mujcic and Oswald,
2016), and socio-emotional flourishing, which captures feelings
of meaning, purpose, and fulfillment in life (Conner et al., 2015,
2017a). Importantly, these associations between FVI and various
mental health indicators appear to be (i) dose-dependent (to
various points) whereby higher intakes of fruit and vegetables
(FV) are associated with increasingly higher mental health scores
(e.g., Blanchflower et al., 2013), (ii) robust when controlling
for demographic, economic/social, and health covariates (e.g.,
gender, income, education, BMI, smoking, exercise; Blanchflower
et al., 2013; Mujcic and Oswald, 2016; Bishwajit et al., 2017),
and (iii) bolstered by longitudinal and intervention research that
has shown causal relationships between higher FVI and mental
health (Carr et al., 2013; Mujcic and Oswald, 2016; Conner
et al., 2017a; Jacka et al., 2017). For example, using longitudinal
data from 12, 389 people in the Household, Income, and Labor
Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, Mujcic and Oswald
(2016) found that a shift from “low” to “high” intake of FV across
a period of 2 years resulted in significant improvement in life
satisfaction, showing an average gain comparable to moving from
unemployment to employment. Interventions have also shown
that increasing fruit and/or vegetable consumption improves
depressive symptoms among clinically-depressed adults (Jacka
et al., 2017), improves feelings of vigor in young men with
low baseline levels of vitamin C and a higher baseline mood
disturbance (Carr et al., 2013), and increases flourishing in young
adults with a low baseline consumption of FV (Conner et al.,
2017a). Some research has indicated that positive mood states can
also shift people toward healthier food choices (Gardner et al.,
2014), and negative mood states such as stress can shift people
toward unhealthier food choices and overeating (Singh, 2014);
however, the longitudinal and experimental research designs
outlined above provide convincing evidence that FVI can also
have a direct and causal impact on subsequent psychological
well-being.
While it is clear that there is a relationship between FVI and
mental health, it is still unknown whether the ways that fruits
Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; FVI, fruit and vegetable intake; SES,

and vegetables are prepared and consumed—that is, whether
they are eaten raw, cooked, or from cans—might have distinctly
different effects on mental health. There is evidence from the
nutrition literature that the nutrient content in FV is reduced
with cooking and canning. Cooking fruits and vegetables can
alter the bioavailability of nutrients, which may have been
hypothesized to play an influential role in the neurotransmission
systems involved in mood and well-being (Kaplan et al., 2007).
Water-soluble nutrients such as vitamin C and B vitamins are
particularly vulnerable to heat degradation (Nicoli et al., 1999;
Lee and Kader, 2000; Rickman et al., 2007a,b), which means that
cooking would reduce the amount of mental health-conferring
micronutrients from foods like spinach, bell peppers/capsicum,
and green beans. Some evidence also suggests that cooking can
reduce the quantity and activity of antioxidants (Nicoli et al.,
1999; Zhang and Hamauzu, 2004), which is considered another
mechanism linking FVI to mental health (Kaplan et al., 2007).
However, other research indicates that cooking can actually
enhance the bioavailability and activity of antioxidants (Dewanto
et al., 2002; Turkmen et al., 2005; Miglio et al., 2008), and, that
fat-soluble nutrients such as vitamins A, D, E, and K are less
susceptible to damage by heat and processing than water-soluble
nutrients, thus limiting the deleterious effects of cooking on
nutrient profiles (Rickman et al., 2007b; Yuan et al., 2009). The
effects of cooking on nutrient profiles may also differ between
types of fruits and vegetables; for example, cooking tomatoes
enhances the bioavailability of nutrients such as lycopene and
antioxidants, whereas cooking broccoli loses many of its vital
nutrients (Dewanto et al., 2002; Vallejo et al., 2002; Yuan et al.,
2009). Further, eating canned FVI may also confer a nutrient
profile similar to cooked FVI. Evidence has shown that longer
storage times for canned fruits and vegetables can reduce the
bioavailability of nutrients (Rickman et al., 2007a). Other forms
of processing like freezing may not be as deleterious on nutrient
content (Hebrero et al., 1988; Asami et al., 2003), but may depend
on how people consume the frozen produce; for example, frozen
berries eating in smoothies might retain their nutrient density,
whereas frozen vegetables, which typically requires thawing and
cooking, might have reduced nutrient content. Overall, the
nutritional evidence regarding processing (cooking, canning,
freezing), and nutrient loss in fruits and vegetables is nuanced.
Yet for key micronutrients that have been linked to mental health
such as vitamin C and carotenoids (Boehm et al., 2013; Carr
et al., 2013), cooking and canning would most likely lead to a
degradation in nutrients, thereby limiting their beneficial impact
on mental health.
There is some evidence of differential associations with
mental health depending on whether FV is consumed raw or
in processed forms. We found three correlational studies that
measured raw and cooked FVI separately and reported their
associations with mental health; all three found that raw FVI
was the stronger predictor of some (but not all) mental health
outcomes than cooked FVI (Appleton et al., 2007; Mikolajczyk
et al., 2009; El Ansari et al., 2014). In one study of 10,602 men
living in France and Ireland, higher intakes of raw fruits and
vegetables were significant predictors of less depressed mood
(b = −0.10 and b = −0.13, respectively), while cooked vegetables

were not (b = −0.02) (Appleton et al., 2007). In another a study of
3,706 undergraduate students across the United Kingdom, only
consumption of salads/raw vegetables was negatively associated
with stress in men; whereas raw fruit, raw vegetables, and cooked
vegetables all significantly related to lower stress levels in women
(El Ansari et al., 2014). Finally, in a study of 1,800 European
students, there was a stronger inverse relationship between the
consumption of salad and stress (b = −1.121) than that of cooked
vegetables and stress (b = −0.82) in women; however, there were
no differences between salads vs. cooked vegetables in regards to
depressive symptoms (b = −1.69 vs. b = −1.69, both significant)
(Mikolajczyk et al., 2009).
The differential effects of raw vs. processed FVI on mental
health could help to explain the results of a recent intervention
study by Conner et al. (2017a). In that study, participants were
randomized to either receive fresh FV for 2 weeks (a parcel
of fresh carrots, kiwifruit or oranges, and apples), receive daily
text-message reminders to increase FVI for 2 weeks (plus given
a voucher to purchase FV), or a diet-as-usual control group.
Both the intervention groups reported significant increases in
FVI; however, only the group that directly received FV reported
improved well-being. The authors proposed that this difference
might be accounted for by the nature in which the FV were
consumed. The group who received fresh FV indicated they were
more likely to consume their produce raw, while the reminder
group indicated higher rates of cooked FV. Although Conner
et al. (2017a) did not measure preparation and eating methods
except informally through a retrospective questionnaire, they
speculated that the ways in which their participants chose to
eat their produce may have influenced the extent to which FVI
affected their participants’ well-being.
In spite of the preliminary evidence for the differential role
of raw vs. processed FVI, it is still not completely clear whether
consumption of raw FVI is superior to cooked or processed FVI
in regards to mental health benefits. Although some preliminary
evidence suggests an advantage of raw FVI over processed FVI
(Appleton et al., 2007; Mikolajczyk et al., 2009; El Ansari et al.,
2014; Conner et al., 2017a), research has not expressly tested the
differential associations between raw vs. cooked/processed FVI
on mental health outcomes, and, prior studies have largely been
restricted to negative aspects of mental health such as depression
(except Conner et al., 2017a).
The aim of the current study was to investigate whether
raw FVI is more strongly associated with a range of mental
health outcomes than processed FVI in a cross-sectional survey
of over 400 young adults. We contrasted consumption of raw
fruit and raw vegetables with relatively more processed forms
of these foods (cooked, frozen, canned or tinned, as a group)
in order to investigate the benefits of FV in an unmodified
state (raw), compared to FV that has undergone a level of
processing that may cause changes to the nutrient quality
and quantity. Six aspects of mental health were measured
to capture both negative and positive aspects of the illness-
wellness continuum: depressive symptoms, anxiety, negative
mood, positive mood, life satisfaction, and flourishing. A wide
range of demographic and health covariates were also measured.
It was hypothesized that stronger associations would occur
between raw FVI and mental health than between cooked or
processed FVI and mental health, and that these associations
for raw FVI and mental health would remain significant when
controlling for the covariates. It was also hypothesized that
there would be stronger relationships between raw FVI and
the presence of positive mental health rather than absence of
negative mental health, given the patterns in recent literature.
Overall, evidence of a stronger association between raw FVI and
mental health outcomes (vs. cooked/processed FVI and mental
health outcomes) could have implications for public health policy
recommendations to consume more fruits and vegetables in their
raw and unprocessed forms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a cross-sectional, correlational design. Because fruit
and vegetable consumption varies by age (Billson et al., 1999;
University of Otago and Ministry of Health, 2011), our study
focused on a single age group of young adults ages 18–25. Young
adults typically have the lowest fruit and vegetable consumption
of all age groups (Thompson et al., 1999; University of Otago and
Ministry of Health, 2011) and they are at high risk for mental
health disorders (Johnston et al., 2014).
Participants and Procedure
Table 1 presents the participant characteristics of the sample. The
participants were 422 young adults between 18 and 25 years old.
Participants were recruited either as part of their undergraduate
psychology course at a large New Zealand university (N = 105),
or through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTURK, N = 317)
an online crowdsourcing marketplace that allows researchers to
source large groups of people to complete online surveys in
exchange for payment. Participants needed to be 18–25 years
old, and MTurk participants were required to be living in the
United States, Australia, or the United Kingdom due to similar
dietary patterns to the local New Zealand sample allowing
for ease of comparison. However, too few participants were
recruited from Australia and the United Kingdom. As such,
the final MTurk sample included only individuals from the
United States. All participants were provided with an electronic
information sheet about the questionnaire, which was broadly
advertised as a questionnaire about lifestyle factors with no
specific reference to the aims of investigating diet or mental
health. This study was approved by the University of Otago
Human Ethics Committee (Category B) (#D17/158) and all
participants provided informed consent by way of electronic
signature. Upon completing the 25-min online questionnaire,
Psychology Students were remunerated with course credits
for completing a brief worksheet based on their participation
and MTURK participants received a small cash payment of
US$1.50. MTURK participants were required to complete various
attention checks embedded in the questionnaire to ensure
accurate and meaningful answers were being obtained (N = 76
did not pass attention checks and were not allowed to continue
with the survey). Data were collected between the months of
March and June 2017.

Measures
Demographics
The first section of the questionnaire contained demographic
covariate measures of age, gender (male, female, or gender
diverse), ethnicity (Caucasian, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Mixed,
other), student/employment status, and childhood and current
socio-economic status (SES). Childhood SES was measured with
three items (“My family usually had enough money for things
when I was growing up;” “I grew up in a relatively wealthy
neighborhood;” “I felt relatively wealthy compared to the other
kids in my high school”); current SES was measured with three
items (“I have enough money to buy things I want;” “I don’t
need to worry too much about paying my bills;” “I don’t think
I’ll have to worry about money too much in the future”) (based
on Griskevicius et al., 2011). Participants stated how much they
agreed with each item using a Likert scale that ranged from 1
(Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree).
Lifestyle Factors and Other Health Behaviors
The second section contained a range of health and lifestyle
covariate measures. Participants rated the quantity and quality
of their sleep using two items from the Basic Nordic Sleep
Questionnaire (Partinen and Gislason, 1995), asking “In a typical
week, how many hours per night do you usually sleep?” and
“How refreshed do you feel when waking up from sleep?”
with five response options ranging from “Never refreshed”
to “Very refreshed.” A single item was used to measure
physical activity, asking how many days in a typical week
an individual completes at least 30 min of exercise that was
“enough to raise your breathing rate” (Milton et al., 2011). A
number of examples of physical exercise were provided (e.g.,
cycling) as well as exclusions (e.g., housework). Participants
entered their height and weight (responses available in both
imperial and metric units) which was used to compute BMI
(Nuttall, 2015). Participants indicated (yes/no) if they had any
known health conditions from a list of 10 conditions including
diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2), hypertension, history of cancer,
osteoporosis, disordered eating behavior, cardiovascular disease,
anemia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Irritable Bowel Syndrome
or Crohn’s Disease, or “other,” and they indicated (yes/no)
whether they had any food allergies from a list (i.e., dairy, eggs,
peanuts, tree nut, wheat, soy, shellfish or fish, or other). Alcohol
consumption was assessed by asking how many days in a typical
week they consumed alcohol, and on those days when consuming
alcohol, how many standard drinks they typically consumed,
which were multiplied to derive a weekly alcohol consumption
estimate. Participants also answered whether they currently used
prescription anti-depressant or mood stabilizing medication, and
whether they regularly took any vitamin or mineral supplements.
Smoking status was assessed by asking how often participants
smoked with five options: “I don’t smoke now,” “Less than once a
month,” “At least once a month,” “At least once a week,” and “At
least once a day.”
Dietary Assessment
The second section of the survey also contained a range of dietary
assessment questions, but the four categories relevant to this

Fruit, Vegetables, and Optimal Mental Health
report are: raw vegetables; cooked/frozen/canned/tinned vegetables
(processed vegetables); raw fruits; and cooked/canned/tinned
fruits (processed fruits). Table 2 lists the dietary questions. For
each food category, participants estimated the number of days
per week they ate that food (0–7 days/week). If they reported
eating that food at least 1 day per week, then they reported the
number of servings they typically consumed on days when they
ate that food (1–7+ servings/day, serving defined for each food
category) and the types of foods they typically consumed from
a checklist of commonly consumed foods in that category (e.g.,
carrots, lettuce, etc.). These three questions provided quantitative
information regarding the intake of various food groups and also
more richly descriptive information about the types of foods they
typically ate within each food category. This method of dietary

assessment has been used in similar previous research (Lesani
et al., 2016; Mujcic and Oswald, 2016). In addition, an index of
four unhealthy foods (chocolate, candy/lollies, French fries/hot
chips, and soda; see Table 2) was measured as a covariate as well
as several other food groups not discussed in the present report
(legumes, juices).
Following the dietary assessment, participants were asked
additional questions about their dietary habits including how
they typically purchase and prepare their food with six possible
responses (“I mainly purchase and prepare my food myself,” “I
mainly buy and cook food as a flat, apartment, or in a group,”
“My parents mainly prepare my food” or “I mainly prepare
and purchase my food with my partner,” “I mainly eat at my
University Residence Hall/Dormitory,” or “other”), and, whether
they restrict or exclude certain foods based on health or ethical
reasons to measure vegetarian status.
Mental Health Measures
Depressive Symptoms
Depressive symptoms were measured using the Centre for
Epidemiological
Depression
Scale
(CESD;
Radloff,
1977).
Participants rated 20 statements about feelings of depression “in
the last week including today,” with the response options “Rarely
or none of the time (<1 day),” “Some or a little of the time (1–2
days),” “Occasionally or a moderate amount of the time (3–4
days),” and “Most or all of the time (5–7 days),” corresponding to
an item score of 0, 1, 2, or 3. Responses were summed, reverse
scoring as needed (α = 0.929).
Anxiety
Anxiety was measured using the 7 item Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale—Anxiety Subscale (HADS-A; Zigmond and
Snaith, 1983). Anxiety symptoms felt “in the last week including
today,” were rated with response options of “Not at all,” “From
time to time, occasionally,” “A lot of the time,” and “Most of the
time,” corresponding to an item score of 0, 1, 2, or 3. Responses
were summed, reverse scoring as needed (α = 0.854).
Negative and Positive Mood
Negative and positive mood was measured using a scale based
on the affective circumplex (Barrett and Russell, 1999). The
scale consisted of 24 mood items that varied by valence
(negative/positive) and activation (high/medium/low). The
negative mood items were hostile, stressed, irritable, angry,
anxious, annoyed, nervous, tense, hopeless, unhappy, dejected, and
sad. The positive mood items were enthusiastic, excited, energetic,
joyful, happy, cheerful, pleasant, good, relaxed, calm, content,
and satisfied. Items were randomized and presented in the same
order for all participants. Participants responded to the question
“Typically, do you feel...” for each item using a Likert scale
anchored at 0 (None of the time), 1 (A little of the time), 2 (Some
of the time), 3 (A good bit of the time), and 4 (Most of the
time). Responses were averaged for a measure of negative mood
(α = 0.945) and positive mood (α = 0.953).
Life Satisfaction
Life Satisfaction was measured with the Satisfaction with Life
Scale (SWLS; Diener et al., 1985). Participants rated five
statements for how they “personally feel at this time in [their]
life,” e.g., “In most ways, my life is close to ideal” and “If I could
live my life over, I would change almost nothing.” Responses were
made on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly
agree), which were summed (α = 0.905).
Flourishing
Flourishing was measured with the Flourishing Scale (Diener
et al., 2010). Participants rated their agreement with eight
statements related to well-being, including “I am engaged and
interested in my daily activities” and “I lead a purposeful and
meaningful life” on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly disagree) to
7 (Strongly agree), which were summed (α = 0.922).
Data Preparation
Six participants were excluded due to incomplete data and two
participants were excluded due to suspected errors in responding,
which resulted in a final sample size of 422 participants. Gender
was dummy coded using two variables with male gender as the
reference group (male, female, and gender diverse coded as 0, 1,
0, and 0, 0, 1, respectively). Ethnicity was dummy coded using
three variables with Caucasian ethnicity as the reference group
(Caucasian, Asian, Black, all others, as 0, 1, 0, 0, and 0, 0, 1, 0, and
0, 0, 0, 1), respectively. Student status was dummy coded as 0 for
non-students and 1 for any full- or part-time students. Childhood
and current SES items were averaged to produce a total SES
score (α = 0.844). BMI was computed by dividing weight by
kilograms by the square of height in meters (Nuttall, 2015).
Smoking was dummy coded to indicate non/infrequent smokers
(0) vs. regular smokers who smoked at least once per week or
more (1). Health condition, food allergy, and food restriction
variables were dummy coded to indicate absence (0) or presence
(1) of any major health condition, food allergy, or vegetarianism,
respectively.
Average daily servings of food groups were calculated by
multiplying days per week consumed by servings per day
consumed, and then dividing by seven to get an average daily
intake estimate. This computation was done for each food
category separately. We also created a combined raw fruit and
vegetable daily intake (raw FVI) variable by summing the daily
raw fruit and daily raw vegetable serving estimates together, and
a combined processed fruit and vegetable intake (processed FVI)
variable by summing the daily cooked/canned fruit and daily
cooked/canned/frozen vegetable estimates together. Lastly, we
created a combined unhealthy food index by summing the daily
servings for chocolate, candy, French fries, and soda, however,
due to low reliability (α = 0.276), the items were analyzed
separately.
Statistical Analyses
Firstly, between-person (cross-sectional) relationships were
tested using bivariate correlation coefficients in SPSS to
investigate whether average raw and processed FVI, as well
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org

April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 487
 Brookie et al.
Fruit, Vegetables, and Optimal Mental Health
as unhealthy food intake, were associated with mental health
outcomes.
Secondly, a series of hierarchical regression analyses were
conducted to predict the six mental health outcomes—
depressive symptoms, anxiety, negative mood, positive mood,
life satisfaction, and flourishing—from raw FVI and processed
FVI as simultaneous predictors, controlling for the demographic
and health covariates. All continuous variables were centered
for analysis. In the first step, we entered the two fruit and
vegetable variables (raw FVI and processed FVI, both centered)
as simultaneous predictors plus their quadratic terms to test for
any non-linear associations with the mental health outcomes.
Non-significant quadratic terms were dropped from the final
models for simplicity. In the second step, we entered covariates
to isolate the unique associations between FVI and mental health.
Covariates were included in the model if they correlated with
either the predictors (raw FVI or processed FVI) and/or any of
the mental health outcome measures. The covariate related to
food preparation was dummy coded 1 if their parents prepared
their food and 0 for all others because this was the only contrast
that covaried with the predictor(s)/outcome(s).
Lastly, we conducted exploratory analyses to determine which
individual types of raw or processed fruits and vegetables
were most strongly associated with mental health. Unadjusted
bivariate correlations were computed between endorsement of a
given food (0 vs. 1) and each of the six mental health measures
to investigate whether particular food items were more strongly
related to mental health outcomes than others.
RESULTS
Descriptive Data
The descriptive statistics can be found in Table 1. Overall,
the sample was predominantly female (66.1%) and a majority
identified as Caucasian (67.5%). The combined childhood and
adult mean SES score (4.12) fell within a middle range, suggesting
that participants perceived themselves as no better or worse off
than others. The average BMI (24.85) was at the higher end
of a healthy range (18–25). In regards to food consumption,
healthy food items (fruits, vegetables) were eaten more frequently
than the unhealthy foods. Participants reported eating ∼3.2
daily servings of FV, which mostly consisted of raw fruit (1.2

servings), raw vegetables (1.0 servings), and processed vegetables
(0.9 servings). Processed fruits were not frequently eaten (0.1
servings). The mean depressive symptoms score was 1.5 points
above the 16-point cut-off for CES-D scores indicating possible
risk for clinical depression. The mean anxiety score was below
the 8-point cut-off on the HADS-A and therefore indicative
of normal levels of anxiety. Positive mood was higher than
negative mood, but life satisfaction was at the lower end of the
average range for American college students (20–24) (Pavot and
Diener, 1993) and flourishing was in the lower 25% compared to
American college students (Diener et al., 2010).
There were several significant differences between the
MTURK and Psychology participants (data available from
authors). Those recruited from MTURK (vs. Psychology) tended
to be more male (36.0 vs. 21.0%), more ethnically diverse (66.6 vs.
70.5% Caucasian), older age (22.3 vs. 19.5 years), lower SES (4.0
vs. 4.6), have greater BMI (25.38 vs. 23.25), and feel less satisfied
with their lives (21.2 vs. 23.7). Because of this difference, sample
was included as a covariate in the regression analyses (coded
Psychology = 0; MTurk = 1).
Table 3 presents the inter-correlations among the fruit and
vegetable measures, the unhealthy foods measures, and the
mental health measures. The correlation between raw FVI and
processed FVI was 0.265, p < 0.001. The correlation between
raw fruits and raw vegetables was 0.422, p < 0.001. The
correlation between processed fruits and processed vegetables
was 0.103, p < 0.05. There were few associations between the fruit
and vegetable measures and unhealthy foods. Consumption of
processed FVI, particularly processed fruits, was associated with
more unhealthy foods like candy and French fries. The unhealthy
foods correlated with each other, with the exception of chocolate.
All of the mental health measures were significantly correlated
with each other above |r| 0.50, all ps < 0.001.
Bivariate Correlations Between Fruit and
Vegetable Intake and Mental Health,
Without Adjustment for Covariates
The bivariate correlations between FVI and measures of mental
health are presented in Table 4. Correlations between the
unhealthy foods and mental health are also presented for
completeness. Raw fruits and vegetables had the strongest
associations with most of the mental health measures. Raw
FVI was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and higher
positive mood, life satisfaction, and flourishing. Raw fruits
were additionally associated with reduced negative mood. By
contrast, processed FVI was only associated with positive mood
but not with any of the other mental health variables. The
size of the correlations was significantly stronger for raw FVI
than processed FVI for depressive symptoms (Z = −3.065,
p = 0.001 one tailed), positive mood (Z = 1.912, p = 0.028 one
tailed), life satisfaction (Z = 2.351, p = 0.009 one tailed), and
flourishing (Z = 2.879, p = 0.002 one tailed) using the difference
test between two dependent correlations with one variable in
common (Lee and Preacher, 2013). The coefficients did not differ
for anxiety (Z = −1.573, p = 0.058 one tailed) or negative
mood (Z = −1.456, p = 0.073 one tailed). The unhealthy foods
composite index was not related to the mental health variables,
although higher soda consumption was correlated with more
depressive symptoms and lower life satisfaction.
Regression Models Using Fruit and
Vegetable Intake to Predict Mental Health,
Adjusting for Covariates
Results from the regression analyses are presented in Table 5.
Raw FVI, but not processed FVI, significantly predicted lower
depressive symptoms and higher positive mood, life satisfaction,
and flourishing when controlling for the covariates. There was
also a significant quadratic pattern between raw FVI and positive
mood, as shown in Figure 1. The inflection point occurred at 6.5
servings per day. This indicates that incremental improvements
in positive mood were observed up to six and a half servings
of raw FVI a day, after which increasing servings of raw FVI
was associated with no additional benefits to positive mood. A
quadratic regression term predicting depression from raw FVI
was significant in the first step, but was no longer significant when
demographic and lifestyle covariates were included. Lastly, it is
notable that raw FVI predicted all three of the positive mental
health measures (positive mood, life satisfaction, and flourishing)

and only one of the negative mental health measures (depressive
symptoms), which is consistent with predictions that FVI will be
more strongly related to positive than negative mental health.
Single Food Item Analyses
The unadjusted bivariate correlations between endorsement of
a given food and each of the six mental health measures are
presented in Tables 6, 7. In terms of raw vegetables, what could
be considered “salad fixings” were most significantly related
to aspects of mental health. These included vegetables like
carrots, dark leafy greens (kale, spinach), lettuce, cucumber,
red onion, cabbage, celery, tomato, and mushrooms. In terms
of processed vegetables, pumpkin, mixed frozen vegetables,
potatoes/sweet potatoes, broccoli, and eggplant were significantly

raw fruits such as grapefruit, berries, kiwifruit, stone fruit
(peaches, apricots), pear, frozen berries (eaten raw), and grapes
were related to positive mood and flourishing.
DISCUSSION
This study provided evidence that the consumption of raw fruits
and vegetables has a stronger relationship with mental health
than the consumption of cooked or canned (processed) fruits
and vegetables. Although this was only a correlational design,
the patterns were robust when controlling for demographic and
health covariates, and they paralleled the findings of recent
intervention research showing significant effects of increasing
fresh FVI on mental well-being (e.g., through kiwifruit, Carr
et al., 2013; through carrots, kiwifruit/oranges, apples, Conner
et al., 2017a). Our study findings add to this literature by showing
that when tested side-by-side, the consumption of raw fruits and
vegetables significantly outperformed more processed forms of
FVI in the prediction of mental health. While we did not test
the mechanisms that may explain the stronger link between raw

FVI and mental health, a likely factor is that raw fruits and
vegetables deliver a greater amount of nutrients than cooked or
canned fruits and vegetables. This idea is somewhat supported
by the literature, with evidence indicating that cooking, canning,
and processing can significantly decrease the nutrient content
of some forms of produce (Nicoli et al., 1999; Lee and Kader,
2000; Zhang and Hamauzu, 2004; Rickman et al., 2007a). Raw
fruits and vegetables may provide greater levels of micronutrients
than processed fruits and vegetables, which could explain their
stronger association with improved mental well-being. However,
as outlined previously, evidence of significantly diminished
nutrient levels in cooked and processed produce is varied, and
appears to be individualized from nutrient to nutrient (Dewanto
et al., 2002; Turkmen et al., 2005; Miglio et al., 2008). Further
research is required to determine how processing affects nutrient
levels in fruit and vegetables, and whether this actually translates
to biologically significant differences in subsequent levels of
micronutrients that are provided to the body.
Findings have several applications for the promotion of
health and well-being. First, future experimental research should
examine the effects of increasing raw fruit and vegetables
on mental well-being, given that greater mood-conferring
benefits are likely to be seen with a predominantly raw based
fruit and vegetable supplementation program. If our patterns
are confirmed in intervention studies, it would suggest that
heath policies could focus on promoting the consumption of
raw and unprocessed produce for optimal well-being. Such
interventions will require educating individuals on ways to
prepare and consume fruits and vegetables that are likely
to retain the greatest levels of nutrients. Furthermore, there
may be additional barriers in developing raw plant food
interventions. Previous qualitative research has shown that
people view raw produce as less convenient due to its perishable
nature than canned/processed/frozen produce (Brug et al., 1995;
Hartman et al., 2013). Another limiting factor is cost and
availability. Research has also suggested that people eat raw
fruits and vegetables as snacks, whereas people incorporate more
cooked/canned/processed produce into main meals (Brookie
et al., 2017), and that sometimes raw fruits and vegetables are not
considered satiating enough for a main meal (Brug et al., 1995;
Hartman et al., 2013). Moreover, some people are less open to
eating plant foods (i.e., people low in openness to experience,
Conner et al., 2017b). As such, any policy or intervention aimed
at increasing the consumption of raw fruits and vegetables
may benefit from addressing accessibility and affordability,
considering variation in food preferences, increasing healthy
snacking on fruits and vegetables (with a high likelihood that
these will be raw), and highlighting the ways in which raw FV can
be incorporated into main meals that are satiating and fulfilling.
Given the correlational design, we cannot be sure that food
consumption is directly and causally driving improvements
in mental health. As mentioned previously, mood states
(both positive and negative) have the ability to influence
subsequent food choices. However, the preliminary results
achieved in the current study mean that more controlled
experimental research—that would investigate directionality—
is warranted. This study had other limitations aside from
the correlational design. We used a non-validated food recall

measure. However, this was based on previously designed and
published measures suited to larger population studies (e.g.,
Lesani et al., 2016; Mujcic and Oswald, 2016). Additionally,
there are inherent limitations associated with this type of
dietary recall, including possible errors in estimation and
memory recall, as well as inaccuracy in estimating serving
sizes (Thompson and Byers, 1994). Future research should
consider using gold standard methods such as a weighed dietary
record.
Finally, the current study did not measure some additional
factors that could influence micronutrient availability. We did
not measure different ways of preparing cooked foods that might
affect nutrient content (boiling vs. steaming) nor did we separate
the consumption of cooked vs. canned foods. Further, factors
such as soil deficiencies, fat consumption, storage methods, and
the quality of produce can all influence the availability and
absorption of micronutrients within the body. While these factors
were beyond the scope of the current study, it is important to
keep in mind that the way in which nutrients journey from the
food to the brain is influenced by a multitude of factors, beyond
raw vs. processed.
While the mood-conferring benefits of raw FV provide
sufficient rationale for interventions, it should also be considered
that the levels of poor mental health within this young adult
sample require urgent attention. Young adults are considered
at high risk of having poor mental health (Johnston et al.,
2014), and the current sample was no exception. The mean
depression score for the sample (M = 17.53) was above the 16-
point clinical cut-off point on the CES-D, suggesting that young
adults typically experience some symptoms of depression. The
fact that this clinically significant level of depression was seen
in the American MTurk participants (M = 18.07) and nearly
seen for the New Zealand Psychology participants (M = 15.90)
suggests that this phenomenon of young adult mental ill-
health is pervasive, and does not necessarily reflect geographical
or cultural environments. Given that young adults have high
vulnerability to suffering from mental illness, and they also have
the lowest fruit and vegetable consumption, the current results
reaffirm young adults as an important population to target for
mental health interventions, including those designed to improve
diet.
CONCLUSIONS
The current findings showed that consumption of raw fruits
and vegetables differentially predicted better mental health
than the consumption of processed fruits and vegetables even
when controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and health
covariates. The cooking and processing of FV has the potential
to diminish nutrient levels, which likely limits the delivery of
nutrients that are essential for optimal emotional functioning.
In term of application, our results suggest that policies,
promotions, and interventions that are designed to increase
raw fruit and vegetable consumption may provide an accessible
adjuvant approach to improving mental health in the young
adult population, who remain vulnerable to developing mental
disorders.
