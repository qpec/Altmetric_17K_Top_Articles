Objectives. To examine disparities in the price of tobacco and nontobacco products in
pharmacies compared with other types of stores.
Methods. We recorded the prices of Marlboro, Newport, the cheapest cigarettes, and
bottled water in a random sample of licensed tobacco retailers (n = 579) in California in
2014. We collected comparable data from retailers (n = 2603) in school enrollment zones
for representative samples of US 8th, 10th, and 12th graders in 2012. Ordinary least
squares regressions modeled pretax prices as a function of store type and neighborhood
demographics.
Results. In both studies, the cheapest cigarettes cost significantly less in pharmacies
than other stores; the average estimated difference was $0.47 to $1.19 less in California.
We observed similar patterns for premium-brand cigarettes. Conversely, bottled water
cost significantly more in pharmacies than elsewhere. Newport cost less in areas with
higher proportions of African Americans; other cigarette prices were related to
neighborhood income and age. Neighborhood demographics were not related to water
prices.
Conclusions. Compared with other stores, pharmacies charged customers less
for cigarettes and more for bottled water. State and local policies to pro-
mote tobacco-free pharmacies would eliminate an important source of dis-
counted cigarettes. (Am J Public Health. 2016;106:1858–1864. doi:10.2105/

obacco-free pharmacies are recom-
mended by more than 2 dozen state at-
torneys general, many state pharmacy boards,
and tobacco control advocacy organizations.1,2
In spite of this, public opinion polls do not
reveal uniformly strong public support for this
policy. For example, the percentage of re-
spondents who somewhat or strongly favor
a ban on the sale of all tobacco products in
pharmacies was 31% among US adults3 and
49% among adults in New York.4 Although
public support for tobacco-free pharmacies
increases after policy implementation,5 only 3
states (California, Massachusetts, and Minne-
sota) have such local ordinances, and efforts at
the state level (e.g., Illinois, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island,
Tennessee, West Virginia) have not yet suc-
ceeded. Pharmacies still constitute approxi-
mately 7% of the 380 000 tobacco retailers in
the United States.6 Thus, new evidence about
the paradox of promoting health care and
tobacco products in the same retail space is
needed to inform policy change.
This study focuses on the price of cigarettes
in pharmacies relative to other store types
because price is such an important de-
terminant of tobacco use.7,8 Higher prices
reduce the number of youths who start
smoking as well as the prevalence and
intensity of smoking among youths and
adults.9,10 In addition, higher prices lead more
smokers to make quit attempts and to remain
abstinent.9
In pharmacies that choose to sell tobacco,
higher prices for cigarettes would be more
consistent with a goal of promoting public
health. However, some data suggest that
prices might be lower in pharmacies. For
example, whereas overall sales of cigarettes
declined from 2005 to 2009, sales in phar-
macies increased over the same time period.11
A plausible explanation for increasing sales
during this period is that pharmacies sold
cigarettes at lower prices and offered more
promotional discounts. Lower prices may also
explain why sales data from a national chain
pharmacy found that 1 in 20 customers with
chronic illnesses that are exacerbated by
smoking also purchased cigarettes when they
filled prescriptions.12
Previous studies documented lower ciga-
rette prices in pharmacies, but only compared
with 1 reference category of stores. For
example, in 50 midsize California cities,
premium-brand cigarettes cost less in phar-
maciesthaninsmallmarkets.13InWashington,
DC, the advertised price for Newport (men-
thol) and the cheapest cigarettes was less in

 pharmacies than in convenience stores.14 In
St. Louis, Missouri, the cheapest pack of cig-
arettes cost less in pharmacies than in super-
markets.15 No previous study has examined
how prices in pharmacies compare with prices
in all other types of stores that sell cigarettes, or
has reported such comparisons from samples
representing a geographic area larger than
cities. We addressed important gaps in the
literature by (1) comparing cigarette prices in
pharmacies with those in all other types of
tobacco retailers, (2) including data for pre-
mium brands and the cheapest pack, (3) fea-
turing the price of a nontobacco product for
comparison, and (4) reporting data from 2
representative samples of tobacco retailers, 1 in
California and 1 selected from school enroll-
ment zones across the United States.
In addition, the current research is among
the first to examine variation in cigarette prices
as a function of neighborhood demography
in a representative sample of US tobacco re-
tailers. One previous study examined the price
of Marlboro (nonmenthol) and Newport
(menthol) in a representative sample of US
tobacco retailers from 97 counties in 40
states.16 Newport cost less at stores in neigh-
borhoods (i.e., census tracts) with a higher
proportion of African Americans, a pattern
that has been reported in other studies.14,17
However, no other differences in cigarette
prices by race/ethnicity or income were sig-
nificant. Building on a growing literature
about neighborhood disparities in retail to-
bacco marketing,18 the current research is the
first to compare neighborhood correlates of
cigarette prices with a nontobacco product.
It also examines whether cigarette prices
are lower in neighborhoods with a higher
proportion of youths because this population
is so price sensitive.10
METHODS
We report data from 2 studies in which
trained auditors used different instruments to
collect comparable data about the price and
promotion of tobacco and nontobacco
products.
Study Samples
We obtained data from California (Study
1) from the routine retail marketing
surveillance conducted in licensed tobacco
retailers for the state’s tobacco control pro-
gram every 3 years.19 In 2014, the sample
(n = 579) included 454 stores that were visited
in 2011 and replacement stores that were
randomly selected from the state’s most recent
tobacco retailer licensing list. Telephone
verification confirmed that eligible stores sold
cigarettes.
Data from the Bridging the Gap–
Community Obesity Measures study (Study
2) provided a national sample of tobacco
retailers located in 160 US communities
representing school enrollment zones for
nationally representative samples of 8th-,
10th-, and 12th-grade public school students
in the continental United States in 2012.20,21
The selection of tobacco retailers in Study 2 is
described in detail elsewhere.22 In brief, likely
tobacco retailers were identified from address
lists purchased from InfoUSA and Dun &
Bradstreet, telephone verified, randomly se-
lected from these business lists, and then
supplemented with retailers identified in
the field.
Data Collection Procedures
In Study 1, trained auditors used iPads to
record observations about retail marketing
in a random sample of licensed tobacco
retailers in the state (n = 579; completion
rate = 94.9%) between August and Septem-
ber 2014. Reasons for incomplete audits
(n = 33) were refusals, closures, and other.
Repeat visits by different auditors were
conducted in a random subset of 44 stores
within 12 days after the initial visit to assess
interrater reliability.
In Study 2, trained auditors worked in pairs
to attempt audits in 2492 food stores that sold
tobacco and also in 196 tobacco stores be-
tween May and July 2012. Auditors used
a paper-and-pencil instrument to obtain to-
bacco data in 2603 stores in 160 communities
located across 38 states (completion
rate = 96.8%). The average number of stores
per state was 68.5. Of the 85 incomplete
audits, 63 were due to ineligible businesses
(permanently closed, did not exist, outside
community boundaries, misclassified as an
eligible store type). The remaining in-
complete audits resulted from businesses
being temporarily inaccessible or located in
unsafe areas and from refusals.
Measures
Price of cigarettes. Following a protocol
developed in previous studies,17,19,23 auditors
in both studies recorded the single-pack price
for the most popular premium nonmenthol
brand (Marlboro Red) and menthol brand
(Newport) as well as the cheapest pack of
cigarettes regardless of brand. Study 1 also
collected price data for a value brand (Pall
Mall Red), whereas Study 2 collected price
data for Camel (data not shown). Auditors
indicated whether the sales tax was included.
If price was not advertised, auditors were
instructed to ask a sales clerk.
Price of nontobacco products. Auditors col-
lected prices for bottled water to make com-
parisons between cigarettes and a healthy
product that is widely available in many dif-
ferent types of stores. In both studies, auditors
recorded the price of a 20-ounce bottle of
Aquafina and indicated whether sales tax was
included.InStudy 2,auditors also recorded the
price of a second brand, Dasani, as well as
the price and size of larger or smaller containers
if 20-ounce bottles were not available. We
selected the 2 brands by examining the market
leaders from Nielsen Homescan data, which
were assumed to be the most widely available
in stores.
Store type. In both studies, auditors selected
from among multiple categories that were
defined similarly: convenience stores with
and without gasoline, gas only (kiosks), liquor
stores, pharmacies, supermarkets, smaller
grocery stores, tobacco shops, and other stores
selling tobacco. The pharmacy category did
not include supermarkets or big-box stores
with a pharmacy counter. In Study 1, we
combined gas only (n = 7) and tobacco stores
(n = 8) with other establishments (n = 11)
because of small sample sizes. In Study 2, the
primary focus was on food retailers; therefore,
we excluded from the study gas stations
that did not sell foods. The category of
“other” stores (n = 74) included discount
department stores, newsstands, and general
merchandise stores.
Neighborhood demographics. Both studies
assessed the same set of covariates but used
differentdefinitions of store neighborhoods.In
Study 1, neighborhoods were defined by
a ½-mile roadway network service area around
each store.24 We obtained census tract data on
race (% African American, % Asian/Pacific

 Islander, % other), ethnicity (% Hispanic), age
(% school-aged youths aged 5–17 years and %
young adults aged 18–24 years), median
household income, and population density
from intercensal estimates (GeoLytics Inc, East
Brunswick, NJ) and weighted them in pro-
portion to tract area. In Study 2, we defined
store neighborhoods by aggregated census
block groups, and we derived the same
covariates from the American Community
Survey 5-year estimates for 2007 through
2011. In Study 2, the variables for age were
percentage of youths (younger than 18 years)
and young adults (aged 18–24 years).
Analyses
We computed intraclass correlation co-
efficients (ICCs) to assess concordance be-
tween measures of the same prices by different
data collectors in the same stores. In Study 1,
ICCs for cigarette prices were 0.49 for
Newport, 0.88 for Marlboro, and 0.94 for the
cheapest pack; the ICC for bottled water price
was 0.82. In Study 2, ICCs ranged from 0.97
to 1.0 for cigarettes, and the ICC for bottled
water was 0.75.
For all analyses, we converted prices for
cigarettes and bottled water to the price be-
fore sales tax. In Study 2, we subtracted the
state excise tax on cigarettes from cigarette
prices to eliminate state tax variability as an
explanation for neighborhood variation in
advertised prices. In both studies, ordinary
least squares regression models examined
price as a function of store type, treating
pharmacies as the reference category. Because
of the complex sampling design and the need
to account for the probability of selection of
the school enrollment zone and the store,
Study 2 applied appropriate cluster, stratum,
and weight variables. All models adjusted for
neighborhood demographics, defined in
Study 1 as a store-centered buffer (½-mile
roadway service area around each store) and
defined in Study 2 by aggregated census block
groups. We standardized all census-derived
demographic variables across the entire
sample for each study. We performed all
analyses with IBM SPSS Statistics version 22
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) in Study 1
and with Stata/SE version 13.3 (StataCorp
LP, College Station, TX) in Study 2.
RESULTS
Table 1 summarizes descriptive statistics for
store type and neighborhood covariates as
well as average prices for California (Study 1)
and for the United States (Study 2). Phar-
macies constituted 7.3% of tobacco retailers in
Study 1 and 8.5% in Study 2. Newport was
the more expensive of the cigarette brands in
both the California and US sample (Table 1).
Price Differences by Store Type
Table 2 summarizes multivariate models
for each price as a function of store type and
adjusted for neighborhood demography in
California. Compared with the price of
Marlboro in pharmacies, the price in con-
venience stores, liquor stores, small grocery
stores, and supermarkets was significantly
higher, with average estimated differences
ranging from $0.32 in convenience stores to
$1.12 in supermarkets. Compared with the
price in pharmacies, the price for Newport
was significantly higher in liquor stores and
supermarkets, but prices in small grocery
stores and convenience stores did not differ
from those in pharmacies for this brand. The
cheapest pack of cigarettes cost significantly
more in all store types compared with
pharmacies, with average estimated differ-
ences ranging from $0.47 in liquor stores to
$1.19 in supermarkets.
We observed the opposite pattern for
bottled water: Aquafina cost significantly less
in all other store types than in pharmacies,
with average estimated differences ranging
from $0.13 less in supermarkets to $0.39 less in
small grocery stores.

 Results from the US sample revealed
similar discrepancies in the relative prices of
cigarettes and bottled water in pharmacies
compared with other stores (Table 3).
Pharmacies charged less for Marlboro than
convenience stores, liquor stores, small gro-
cery stores, supermarkets, and other stores,
with the average estimated differences rang-
ing from $0.36 for convenience stores to
$0.63 for grocery stores. The price of New-
port averaged $0.65 higher in supermarkets
and $0.40 higher in small grocery stores than
in pharmacies, but it did not differ signifi-
cantly for convenience stores, liquor stores,
tobacco shops, or other stores. The cheapest
pack of cigarettes cost significantly more in
convenience stores, liquor stores, small gro-
cery stores, and supermarkets than in phar-
macies, with the average price difference
ranging from $0.18 in convenience stores to
$0.57 in grocery stores. Cigarette prices in
pharmacies did not differ significantly from
prices in tobacco shops, suggesting that phar-
macies sold Marlboro, Newport, and the
cheapest pack at the same low prices as tobacco
shops. As in Study 1, US pharmacies charged
significantly more than all other store types for
both brands of bottled water (Table 3).
Neighborhood Correlates of Price
Results from multivariate models that ad-
justed for store type illustrate how prices varied
as a function of race/ethnicity, age, median
household income, and population density in
California (Table 2) and the United States
(Table 3). In both studies, Newport menthol
cost less in neighborhoods with a higher
proportion of African American residents

increase in the proportion of African Ameri-
cansinCalifornianeighborhoods)andinStudy
2 ($0.09 less with each 17.6-percentage-point

port menthol also cost less in store
neighborhoods with a higher proportion of
Asians/Pacific Islanders ($0.13 per pack with
each 13.3-percentage-point increase in the
proportion of Asian/Pacific Islander residents).

 years) living in the store neighborhood,
Marlboro cost 13 cents less and the cheapest
pack cost 24 cents less (Table 2). However,
variables related to the composition of youths or
young adults in the neighborhood did not
predict variation in cigarette prices in the US
sample (Table 3).
As shown in Tables 2 and 3, the cheapest
cigarette pack cost less in neighborhoods with
lower median household income, both in
California and in the US sample. None of the
variables related to race/ethnicity, age, and
income predicted variation in the price of
bottled water in either study.
DISCUSSION
This study is the first that we are aware of to
compare prices for tobacco and nontobacco
products as a function of store type and
neighborhood demography. The inclusion of
a nontobacco product addresses the question
of whether lower prices in pharmacies are
unique to cigarettes. In 2 representative
samples of tobacco retailers, a consistent
pattern emerged: compared with other types
of stores, pharmacies charged customers less
for cigarettes and more for bottled water. In
the California and US samples, Marlboro and
the cheapest pack of cigarettes cost less in
pharmacies than in nearly all other types of
tobacco retailers. Conversely, bottled water,
an indisputably healthy product, cost more in
pharmacies than in all other types of tobacco
retailers.
One potential explanation for cheaper
cigarettes in pharmacies is that this category of
store is composed almost entirely of large
corporate chains and very few small, in-
dependent stores. To the extent that the
tobacco industry rewards volume sales with
discounted prices, this may explain some of
the relatively lower cigarette prices in phar-
macies than in other types of stores.
In 2 representative samples of tobacco
retailers in California and the United States, 1
consistent pattern emerged about the
relationship between neighborhood de-
mographics and cigarette price. The most
popular brand of menthol was significantly
cheaper in neighborhoods with a higher
proportion of African American residents.
This pattern is consistent with several previous
studies16,17 and emblematic of a pattern of
racial disparities in retail tobacco marketing
that were documented in a systematic re-
view.16 In fact, differences in the relative price

aCoefficients from ordinary least squares regression with a CI that includes 0.00 are not statistically significant (P < .05). Neighborhood demographics are
standardized across the entire sample; for example, Newport menthol cost $0.09 less with each standard deviation (18-percentage-point) increase in the
percentage of African Americans. Pretax price excludes sales tax and state excise tax (cigarettes only).

 of Newport across store types were not as
consistent as for other cigarettes, possibly
because neighborhood demographics
explained as much or more variation in the
price of Newport than store type did. There
was lower reliability for the price of Newport
in the California sample. However, this
concern is mitigated by consistent results (e.g.,
it was cheaper in neighborhoods with a higher
proportion of African Americans) in both
studies reported here and in other studies.16,17
In California, Marlboro and the cheapest
cigarette pack cost significantly less in
neighborhoods with a higher proportion of
school-age youths, but no such pattern was
observed in the US study. The 2 studies had
different operational definitions of youths
and store neighborhoods, used different
sampling strategies for tobacco retailers, and
collected data in different years, all of which
could contribute to the discrepant findings.
Future research about cigarette price and
neighborhood demography should consider
whether price varies with the percentage of
school-age youths in other settings, whether
this association varies across geographies,
or whether this neighborhood characteristic
is a proxy for some other variable that cor-
relates with cigarette price.
Results from this research are consistent
with other studies indicating that corporate
practices for some pharmacies are antithetical
to protecting public health. For example, in
a North Carolina study, pharmacies were
more than 3 times more likely than grocery
stores to violate marketing provisions of the
US Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco
Control Act, such as self-service displays of
smokeless tobacco or advertising for low,
light, or mild cigarettes.25 In California and
other states, the high rates of sales-to-minor
violations observed in pharmacies and
other retail chains prompted many state
attorneys general to negotiate agreements
with these retailers to enhance compliance
with employee training programs and to
reduce youths’ access to tobacco.26,27
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of this research are the 2 in-
dependent studies with large representative
samples of tobacco retailers, and different data
collection periods (i.e., before and after
CVS Caremark abandoned tobacco sales in
2014). The inclusion of multiple cigarette
brands and the price of a nontobacco product
for comparison with cigarettes are
additional strengths.
Limitations of this research are the rela-
tively small samples of pharmacies and a nar-
row definition of this store type. Future
studies should consider oversampling phar-
macies to better detect differences between
stores types. In addition, future research
should consider including supermarkets and
big-box stores with a pharmacy counter in the
definition of pharmacies because policies that
pertain to tobacco-free pharmacies include
these store types as well.
Public Health Implications
Evidence about disparities in cigarette
price is important to state and local tobacco
control policy because price is among the
most important determinants of tobacco use,
and limiting the availability of low-cost to-
bacco products is recommended to improve
health equity.7,8 As an alternative to tax in-
creases, policy interventions that may have
differential effects in pharmacies are to restrict
price promotions and coupons and to
establish or strengthen minimum price laws
for tobacco products.28
Results from the current study may also
be useful to state and local programs to
bolster and reframe messages about policy
interventions to promote tobacco-free
pharmacies. Arguments for tobacco-free
pharmacies typically emphasize product
availability: why do pharmacies sell cigarettes
at all? The findings from this research raise
concerns about product price: why do
pharmacies sell cigarettes at the cheapest
prices?
A popular counterargument to tobacco-
free pharmacies is that the policy matters little
because pharmacies represent a small pro-
portion of tobacco retailers.29 However,
eliminating the cheapest source of cigarettes
first is a logical recommendation for state and
local jurisdictions that aim to reduce tobacco
retailer density and promote health equity.
Previous research has estimated that
tobacco-free pharmacies would result in
a 10% reduction in the number of tobacco
retailers in Massachusetts30 and a 14% re-
duction in North Carolina.31 In addition,
evidence from California and Massachusetts
suggests a possible spillover effect of local
ordinances for tobacco-free pharmacies on
other tobacco retailers.32 Results from this
study suggest that in addition to reducing the
retail availability of tobacco products, banning
their sale in pharmacies would eliminate an
important source of cheap cigarettes. Thus,
tobacco-free pharmacies may better promote
public health by eliminating the paradox of
cheap prices and promotions for cigarettes in
a retail environment where consumers seek
smoking cessation aids and other health
remedies.
