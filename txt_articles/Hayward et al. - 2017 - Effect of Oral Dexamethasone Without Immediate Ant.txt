OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical effectiveness of oral corticosteroids for acute sore throat
in the absence of antibiotics.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial
(April 2013-February 2015; 28-day follow-up completed April 2015) conducted in 42 family
practices in South and West England, enrolled 576 adults recruited on the day of presentation
to primary care with acute sore throat not requiring immediate antibiotic therapy.
INTERVENTIONS Singleoraldoseof10mgofdexamethasone(n = 293)oridenticalplacebo(n = 283).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary: proportion of participants experiencing complete
resolution of symptoms at 24 hours. Secondary: complete resolution at 48 hours, duration of
moderately bad symptoms (based on a Likert scale, 0, normal; 6, as bad as it could be), visual
analog symptom scales (0-100 mm; 0, no symptom to 100, worst imaginable), health care
attendance, days missed from work or education, consumption of delayed antibiotics
or other medications, adverse events.

A
cute sore throat is one of the most common symp-
tomsamongpatientspresentingtoprimarycare.1,2Sore
throats resulted in 92 million estimated visits by adults
to primary care practices and emergency departments in the
United States between 1997 and 2010, averaging 6.6 million
annually; with unnecessary antibiotic prescribing costs of at
least $500 million.3 Antibiotics are prescribed at 60% of UK
primary care sore throat consultations,4 and the trend is not
decreasing3,5 despite the low risks of suppurative complica-
tions, limited symptomatic benefit,6 and national guidelines
advising against prescriptions.7,8 There is a need to find alter-
native strategies that reduce symptoms, reduce the burden of
acute illness, and reduce antibiotic consumption.
Corticosteroidsinhibittranscriptionofproinflammatoryme-
diators in airway endothelial cells, responsible for pharyngeal

upper respiratory tract infections such as acute sinusitis10 and
croup.11 Short courses of oral steroids have been shown to be
safe, in the absence of contraindications.12 A systematic re-
viewreportedthatparticipantswithasorethroat,takingasingle
dose of steroid, were 3 times more likely to experience com-
plete resolution within 24 hours.13 However, antibiotics were
prescribed to participants in both steroid and placebo groups
in all trials and only 1 trial recruited participants from primary
care. Therefore, evidence for corticosteroids for sore throat in
primary care, in the absence of antibiotics, is still lacking.
The primary objective of the TOAST (Treatment Options
without Antibiotics for Sore Throat) trial was to investigate,
among adults 18 years or older with acute sore throat not re-
quiring immediate antibiotic therapy, whether a single dose
oforaldexamethasonecomparedwithplacebo,increasedreso-
lution of symptoms 24 hours after consultation.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This multicenter, individually randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, parallel group trial involved 42 general
practice (GP) clinics in South and West England. Recruitment
started on April 12, 2013, and completed on February 27, 2015.
Participants were followed up for 28 days after randomiza-
tion (follow-up completed on April 16, 2015). The research pro-
tocol (Supplement 1) was approved by the National Research
EthicsCommitteeSouthCentral.Writteninformedconsentwas
obtained for all participants.
Full details of the trial design, inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria are available (Supplement 2). Briefly, included partici-
pants were aged 18 years or older, presenting to a primary care
clinician (general practitioner or practice nurse) with acute
symptoms (onset within the last 7 days) of sore throat and
odynophagia (pain on swallowing) that the clinician judged to
be caused by an infection but that did not need immediate
antibiotics, and who had the capacity and willingness to give
consent and complete the trial paperwork. Exclusion criteria
included recent (<1 month) use of inhaled or oral corticoste-
roids or adenotonsillectomy, recent use (<14 days) of antibi-
otics, and a clear alternative diagnosis (eg, pneumonia).
Randomization, Concealment, and Masking
Randomization (1:1) was stratified by study center and by re-
ceipt of a delayed antibiotic prescription. A randomization list
using block randomization with variable blocks of size 2, 4, or
6 was computer generated by an independent statistician for
manufacturing. Each site was allocated to hold 2 sets (for those
whowereofferedantibioticprescriptionandthosenot)ofpacks
of 2 to 3 blocks of blinded prerandomized medication. Partici-
pants in the intervention group received a single dose of 10 mg
of oral dexamethasone as 5 × 2 mg of dexamethasone tablets
overencapsulated by a single-size, 1-gelatin capsule. The con-
trol group received lactose overencapsulated with an identi-
cal capsule. Overencapsulation for both intervention and pla-
cebo was performed by Nottingham University Hospital NHS
Trust Pharmacy. Participants, clinicians, and researchers were
unaware of the allocation of the patient and remained un-
aware until trial completion.
Procedures
Participants were recruited on the day of presentation to their
GP practice with symptoms of sore throat and pain on swal-
lowing. Baseline clinical features and a throat swab were ob-
tained. Rapid streptococcal antigen tests were not available to
clinicians. The clinician was free to decide to offer no antibi-
otic prescription or a delayed antibiotic prescription with their
usualinstructions;typicallytofilltheprescriptionandtakethe
antibiotics if symptoms had not improved in 48 hours. Par-
ticipants were randomized and observed to take the trial medi-
cation.Primaryoutcomedatawerecollectedat24and48hours
via text message or telephone, from days 0 through 7 using a
patient symptom diary, and a review of the patient’
s elec-
tronic medical records at 1 month.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was the complete resolution of sore
throat at 24 hours as reported by the patient by either text mes-
sage or telephone contact regardless of whether they were
offered a prescription for delayed antibiotics. Secondary out-
comes were (1) complete resolution of sore throat at 48 hours;
(2) duration of moderately bad symptoms recorded by
validated14 7-day symptom diary, based on a Likert scale for
Key Points
Question Does a single dose of dexamethasone in the absence of
antibiotics provide symptom relief for acute sore throat in adults
presenting to primary care?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial including 565 adults, the
proportion of participants in the dexamethasone group achieving
complete symptom resolution at 24 hours was not significantly
different from those taking placebo. But at 48 hours significantly
more in the dexamethasone group experienced complete
resolution than did those in the placebo group.
Meaning Among adults presenting to primary care practices with
acute sore throat, a single dose of oral dexamethasone did not
increase the likelihood of symptom resolution at 24 hours but did
increase the likelihood at 48 hours.

orpresentationwithsorethroatsymptoms);and(8)useofover-
the-counter medications and prescription medications in the
first 7 days. The eMethods in Supplement 2 detail deviations
from or amendments to our protocol since the inception of the
trial and the reasons for this. Data were collected concur-
rently during the trial to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis
that will be reported in a future article.
Statistical Analysis
Sample Size
Based on a previous systematic review,13 the minimum abso-
lute increase in resolution of pain at 24 hours with cortico-
steroids was 18% (11% vs 29%) and the average was 27%.
To achieve an 18% increase in resolution with 90% power
and α level of 5% , required 226 participants.
Based on previous data, antibiotic prescriptions are of-
fered to an estimated 50% of participants presenting with sore
throat2; therefore, in order to recruit at least 226 participants
who were not offered antibiotics, 566 participants were re-
cruited, allowing for a 20% loss to follow-up.
Statistical Methods
The primary outcome was analyzed using a log-binomial re-
gressionmodeladjustedforcenterandreceiptofadelayedpre-
scription for antibiotics. Complete resolution of sore throat by
48 hours was analyzed in the same way.
Time to onset of pain relief and to complete pain resolu-
tion was analyzed using a Cox regression model adjusting
for receipt of a delayed antibiotic prescription and for health
center. Participants who did not provide a valid time in their
symptom diary—a time without AM or PM specified and out-
side the feasible range of times for the study—were excluded
from this analysis. The duration of moderately bad or worse
symptoms was analyzed using a negative binomial model
adjusting for center and delayed prescription at baseline
and including completed diary days as an offset. Time
missed from work or education was analyzed using linear
regression adjusted for center and delayed antibiotic pre-
scription. Reconsultation—by visiting or calling—at a health
care facility, including an emergency department, after-
hours primary care facility, or in-hours primary care facility,
with symptoms or complications of sore throat; use of over-
the-counter and prescription medications; and uptake of
delayed antibiotic prescriptions were analyzed using the
same methods as the primary outcome. Sore throat compli-
cations were defined a priori as direct suppurative compli-
cations such as quinsy and paratonsillar abscess; a post hoc
definition that included otitis media, sinusitis, or cellulitis
was also analyzed.
Forvisualanalogscaledata,theareaunderthecurve(AUC)
was calculated using the trapezoidal rule using estimates from
a mixed-effects repeated-measures model adjusting for symp-
tom at baseline, health care center, and delayed antibiotic pre-
scription with a treatment and time interaction. The AUCs be-
tween the 2 groups were then compared using a t test. A linear
regression model was fitted to the change from baseline to day
1 and to day 2 of the symptom diary.
All available data from participants who withdrew from
the study were included. For the analysis of resolution of
symptoms at 24 and 48 hours, participants were classified
as having no resolution of symptoms if data were missing.
Two-sided P values <.05 were considered significant. There
was no adjustment to P values to account for multiple com-
parisons. All secondary outcomes are considered explor-
atory. Analyses were conducted using Stata software ver-
sion 13 (Stata Corp).
Methods for Subgroup Analyses
The analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes were re-
peated in the delayed-antibiotic and no-antibiotic prescrip-
tion subgroups because the study was powered for analysis
within these subgroups separately. Additional subgroup analy-
ses were prespecified in the statistical analysis plan prior to
unblinding of the study data and used interaction tests.
The effect of sore throat severity at baseline (defined using
Centor score15 with a cutoff of <3 and ≥3) was assessed by in-
cluding an interaction term in the log binominal regression
model between treatment group and patient severity. The ef-
fect of rescue medication use (any patient-reported analgesic
medication) in the first 48 hours and presence of streptococ-
cus on throat swabs were analyzed in the same way.
Methods for Sensitivity Analyses
For the analysis of resolution of symptoms at 24 and 48 hours,
it was assumed that participants who did not provide a re-
sponse did not have resolution of their sore throat symp-
toms. Sensitivity analyses, for which missing data were as-
sumedresolved,replacedbymultipleimputationandexcluded
(a complete case analysis) were performed.
Many participants experienced onset of pain relief or com-
plete resolution of pain but did not report the time to onset of
pain relief or time to complete resolution of pain. A sensitiv-
ity analysis that substituted the missing time with the time in
the day that the diary was completed on the day of recruit-
ment was performed. Thus, time was computed in whole days
for these participants.
Results
Of the 691 patients treated at 42 clinics assessed for eligibil-
ity, 115 were excluded; 82 did not meet the inclusion crite-
ria and 33 declined (Figure 1). Two hundred twenty-seven

recruited participants (39.5%) were offered a delayed antibi-
otic prescription. Of the 576 participants (75.2% women)
recruited, 11 (1.9%) were excluded after they had fully par-
ticipated because they were found to be ineligible based on
a review of their clinical notes, so they were not included in
the primary analysis. The 36 participants (6%) who had no
information for the primary outcome were included in the
analysis as having no resolution of symptoms. The median
age of eligible participants was 33.7 years (interquartile
range [IQR], 26.3-45.8 years) in the dexamethasone group
and 34.3 years (IQR, 26.0-45.0 years) in the placebo group,
76.8% were employed or in education. Baseline characteris-
tics of eligible participants were similar between groups
(Table 1). eTable 1 in Supplement 2 details clinician scores of
patient symptoms at baseline, which were also similar
between groups.
Complete Resolution of Sore Throat
For the primary outcome, a single dose of oral dexametha-
sone did not significantly increase the proportion of partici-
pants reporting complete resolution of their sore throat at 24
hours. Sixty-five participants (22.6%) of 288 receiving dexa-
methasone and 49 (17.7%) of 277 receiving placebo reported
complete resolution within 24 hours, for a relative risk (RR)
of 1.28 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.78, P = .14) and a risk difference of
4.7% (95% CI, −1.8% to 11.2%; Figure 2).

dexamethasone group and 17 (15.7%) of 108 in the placebo
group experienced complete resolution of sore throat for an
RR of 1.19 (95% CI, 0.67 to 2.11; P = .55) and a risk difference
of 3.2% (95% CI, −6.5% to 12.9%). These findings were con-
sistent in all sensitivity analyses (eTables 2 through 4 in
Supplement 2).

16.2%; number needed to treat, 12; 95% CI, 7 to 146) (Figure 2).
Among participants who were not offered an antibiotic pre-
scription, 65 (37.6%) in the dexamethasone group and 46
(27.2%) in the placebo group experienced complete sore throat

(32.2%) in the dexamethasone group and 29 (26.8%) in the pla-
cebo group for an RR of 1.19 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.79; P = .41) and
a risk difference of 6.3% (−5.5% to 18.0%). Findings were con-
sistent in all sensitivity analyses (eTables 2 through 4 in
Supplement 2).
Reported use of over-the-counter medications that con-
tained analgesics (topical and oral) for symptom relief in the
first 48 hours was similar for both groups (dexamethasone, 148
patients [77.1%] of 192; placebo, 153 patients [78.9%] of 194)
and was not significantly different for participants reporting
complete resolution of their symptoms at 48 hours (interac-
tion effect, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.79; P = .86).
Neither severity of sore throat at baseline, with an inter-
action effect at 24 hours of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.16 to 2.14; P = .42)

at 48 hours of 1.13 (95% CI, 0.52 to 2.45; P = .75), were mod-
erators of group differences.
Patient Symptom Outcome Measures
The number of days of moderately bad symptoms was not
significantly different between the 2 groups either overall or
within the subgroups who were offered no antibiotic pre-
scription or a delayed antibiotic prescription (eTable 5 in
Supplement 2). Ratings of sore throat pain, pain on swallow-
ing, and difficulty swallowing by using a visual analog scale
showed no significant differences in change from baseline
to day 1, change from baseline to day 2, or in the AUC sum-
mary statistic, either overall or for either subgroup (eTable 6
in Supplement 2).
There were no significant differences between groups in
timetoonsetofpainreliefortimetocompleteresolutionofpain,
either overall or in the subgroups that were offered or not of-
fered a delayed antibiotic prescription (Table 2). A sensitivity
analysis that included all the participants who reported onset
or complete resolution of symptoms but who did not report a
valid time had similar findings (eTable 7 in Supplement 2).
Effect on Health Care Use, Medication Use, and Productivity
Of the 157 participants given a delayed prescription who re-
ported this outcome, 37 (46.8%) of 79 in the dexamethasone
group reported consuming the delayed prescription within
7 days vs 44 (56.4%) of 78 in the placebo group (RR, 0.83;
95% CI, 0.61 to 1.13; P = .23; risk difference, −9.4%; 95% CI,
−25.0% to 6.1%). Post hoc analysis showed that 3 participants
(2.5%) in the dexamethasone group and 5 (4.0%) in the pla-
cebo group who were not offered a delayed prescription re-
ported taking antibiotics in the first 48 hours. There were no
significant differences between groups in the use of pain re-
lief medications (topical and oral), antibiotics for sore throat,
orantibioticsforotherconditionsandnodifferencesinthepro-
portion of participants missing any time away from work

Dexamethasone also did not result in a significant differ-
ence in the mean number of hours missed from work or edu-
cation (mean difference, 0.24 hours longer in dexametha-
sone group; 95% CI, −2.14 to 2.61; P = .85). There were no
significant differences in the number of participants recon-
sulting at emergency departments, urgent care, or their usual
GP clinic for symptoms or suppurative complications of sore
throat (Table 3). In a post hoc analysis, the addition of otitis
media, sinusitis, or cellulitis6 to the complications of the sore
throat definition did not alter outcomes by treatment group
among all patients (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.86 to 2.24; P = .18; risk
difference,3.0%;95%CI,−1.5%to7.5%;amongthosewhowere

scription (RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.56 to 4.60; P = .38, risk differ-
ence, 2.9%; 95% CI, −2.9% to 8.6%).
Serious Adverse Events
Of the 5 serious adverse events, 2 occurred among partic-
ipants in the dexamethasone group, 1 of which was consid-
ered related to the trial (hospital admission with parapharyn-
geal abscess), and 3 serious adverse events occurred in
the placebo group (hospital admission with peritonsillar ab-
scess, hospital admission with severe tonsillitis, and hospital
admission with pneumonia, with subsequent death after hos-
pital discharge).
Discussion
For patients seeking primary care for a sore throat that is not
judged to require immediate antibiotics, no significant ben-
efit of dexamethasone on complete resolution of symptoms
at 24 hours was found. However, at 48 hours dexamethasone
resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of partici-
pants reporting complete resolution, requiring an average of
12 patients to be treated for 1 additional patient to experience
symptom resolution. A similar effect was evident in the sub-
group of participants not offered a delayed antibiotic pre-
scription. No significant differences were observed in
participant-reported duration of moderately bad symptoms,
visual analog scale ratings, time to onset and time to com-
plete resolution of symptoms, or time away from school or
work when comparing dexamethasone with placebo groups.
Three study participants, 2 receiving placebo and 1 dexa-
methasone, required hospitalization related to sore throat,
which is a complication rate similar to previous observational
studies of sore throat treated in primary care.16 Reattendance
with symptoms or complications of sore throat was similar in
both groups.
This trial found an RR of 1.28 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.78) for
complete resolution at 24 hours, which was lower than effect
sizes reported in previous studies of use of oral corticoste-
roids in sore throat, which reported RRs ranging from 1.67

to 4.41.13 However, all previous trials gave antibiotics to both
corticosteroid and placebo treatment groups. It is possible
that there is a synergistic effect of corticosteroids and antibi-
otics when treating sore throat, such as that suggested for
acute sinusitis, for which oral corticosteroid monotherapy
was ineffective for symptom relief in a primary care–based
trial, but corticosteroids in addition to antibiotics offer evi-
dence of benefit.17,18
A second explanation for the smaller effect size in this
study is that corticosteroids are most beneficial for severe sore
throat. Two previous randomized trials19,20 have reported out-
comes following a single dose of oral dexamethasone on a sub-
group of children (n = 154) who tested negative for the rapid
group A streptococcus antigen, to whom antibiotics were of-
fered only after throat swab results confirmed diagnosis or re-
assessment by a clinician. The trial, which included children
with a minimum subjective pain score, demonstrated that
symptom duration and pain intensity were reduced, whereas
the trial in which 24% of children initially reported mild pain
found no effect on symptom duration.
Because this study aimed to evaluate dexamethasone in
the absence of antibiotics, participants requiring immediate
antibiotics, likely to have the most severe sore throat, were
excluded, resulting in a different population from trials
based in emergency departments. Forty-two percent of
adults involved in an emergency department trial21 had
purulent tonsils compared with 10% of those participating in
the current trial. More severe symptoms might correlate
with more severe inflammation and therefore the anti-
inflammatory benefits of corticosteroids would be greater in
this patient group. In this trial the test of interaction
between severity or streptococcal presence and outcome
revealed no significant effect, but this analysis was limited
by the small number of participants in these groups (14.5%
and 15.2%, respectively).
To our knowledge, this is the first trial to evaluate the ben-
efits of oral corticosteroids for acute sore throat in a primary
care setting—where the majority of patients with sore throat
seek treatment—and to evaluate the benefits of oral cortico-
steroids in the absence of antibiotics. Participant adherence
with medication was 100%, and the primary outcome mea-
sure was collected from 93.6% of participants. Participant al-
location by treatment group was well balanced at baseline. The
characteristicsofthepopulationrecruitedweresimilartothose
reported in a previous large observational cohort of partici-
pants presenting to primary care with sore throat.16
This study has several limitations. This trial may have re-
cruited a less severely ill patient group by excluding those re-
quiring immediate antibiotics. Children were also excluded.
Three trials19,20,22 involving children have demonstrated a sig-
nificant benefit of corticosteroids when administered in com-
bination with antibiotics. The return rate of symptom diaries
or follow-up questionnaires was 75%, similar to return rates
for other sore throat trials in primary care23; however, poor
completion rates of diaries resulted in lower rates for 2 out-
come measures. The primary outcome was not validated, but
it is widely used in trials and systematic reviews of acute sore
throat interventions13,21,22,24,25 and was chosen to ensure a
timely and high response rate, key in evaluating response in
acute infection. Other symptom measures used in the study
have been validated in primary care infectious disease
research.14 In addition, this study was underpowered to de-
tect a modest effect on the primary outcome or to detect a dif-
ferenceinadverseeffectprofiles.Alargerstudymayhaveiden-
tified a statistically significant difference between the
treatments.
Uncertainty remains about the role of oral corticoste-
roids for patients presenting in primary care with sore throat.
Corticosteroids may have clinical benefit in addition to anti-
biotics for severe sore throat, for example, to reduce hospital
admissions of those patients who are unable to swallow flu-
ids or medications. There have been no trials of corticoste-
roid use involving these patient groups.26 A recent system-
atic review of 3 small trials suggests early but unsustained
symptomatic benefit in peritonsillar abscess27 with 1 trial dem-
onstrating a reduction in duration of hospitalization.
Adverse effects of corticosteroids may be more significant
in patients with comorbidities, such as diabetes and heart fail-
ure,whowereexcludedfromthistrial.Giventhatpatientscould
receivealargercumulativedoseofcorticosteroidsthroughmul-
tiple primary care visits with sore throat, the potential longer-
term effects of increased steroid consumption (eg, osteoporo-
sis, hypertension) should also be considered.
Conclusions
Among adults presenting to primary care practices with acute
sorethroat,asingledoseoforaldexamethasonecomparedwith
placebo did not increase the proportion of patients with reso-
lution of symptoms at 24 hours. However, there was a signifi-
cant difference at 48 hours.
