intervention

ABSTRACT
Background We evaluated a novel Twitter-delivered
intervention for smoking cessation, Tweet2Quit, which
sends daily, automated communications to small,
private, self-help groups to encourage high-quality,
online, peer-to-peer discussions.
Design A 2-group randomised controlled trial assessed
the net benefit of adding a Tweet2Quit support group to
a usual care control condition of nicotine patches and a
cessation website.
Participants Participants were 160 smokers (4 cohorts
of 40/cohort), aged 18–59 years, who intended to quit
smoking, used Facebook daily, texted weekly, and had
mobile phones with unlimited texting.
Intervention All participants received 56 days of
nicotine patches, emails with links to the smokefree.gov
cessation website, and instructions to set a quit date
within 7 days. Additionally, Tweet2Quit participants were
enrolled in 20-person, 100-day Twitter groups, and
received daily discussion topics via Twitter, and daily
engagement feedback via text.
Measures The primary outcome was sustained
abstinence at 7, 30 and 60 days post-quit date.
Results Participants (mean age 35.7 years, 26.3%
male, 31.2% college degree, 88.7% Caucasian) averaged
18.0 (SD=8.2) cigarettes per day and 16.8 (SD=9.8)
years of smoking. Participants randomised to Tweet2Quit
averaged 58.8 tweets/participant and the average
tweeting duration was 47.4 days/participant. Tweet2Quit
doubled sustained abstinence out to 60 days follow-up
(40.0%, 26/65) versus control (20.0%, 14/70), OR=2.67,
CI 1.19 to 5.99, p=0.017. Tweeting via phone predicted
tweet volume, and tweet volume predicted sustained
abstinence (p<0.001). The daily autocommunications
caused tweeting spikes accounting for 24.0% of tweets.
Conclusions Tweet2Quit was engaging and doubled
sustained abstinence. Its low cost and scalability makes it
viable as a global cessation treatment.
Trial registration number NCT01602536.
BACKGROUND
Social network sites, defined as web-based services
that allow individuals to construct user profiles, com-
municate with others with whom they share a con-
nection, and view others’ communications,1 would
seem to be an ideal forum for self-help groups.2–7
Social network sites are popular, virtually cost-free,
accessible on laptops and mobile devices, and highly
interactive.8 9 In the USA, 73% of online adults
report using social network sites, such as Facebook or
T
witter, with 42% using multiple sites, often daily.10
Social network sites’ potential for facilitating self-
help groups is still unrealised, though. Similar to
predecessor technologies, such as bulletin boards
and listservs, prolonged engagement is often poor;
initial interest may be high but often wanes.2 11–13
Research has identified three main reasons for
this.14–17 People do not see and/or respond to
others’ posts promptly enough, causing dropouts.17
New members’ posts may be ignored because they
lack social capital within the group.16 18 Even active
members gradually lose interest and disengage, and
thus most groups have a limited duration.14
W
e developed a novel intervention for smoking
cessation called T
weet2Quit that seeks to address
these
limitations.
T
weet2Quit
sends
twice-daily
automated communications (‘autocommunications’)
to encourage frequent and concurrent check-in,
forms small intimate groups that start immediately
and are closed to new members, and is purpose-
fully of limited duration. T
weet2Quit builds on
promising past work in buddy interventions, in
which smokers were assigned physically proximal
quit buddies.19–21 With T
weet2Quit, smokers meet
numerous potential quit buddies in a virtual online
forum. Research on T
weet2Quit can provide valu-
able insights about the utility of extratreatment (ie,
peer-based) social support for smoking cessation,
because studies on this topic have been limited, and
results have been mixed.19 22
T
weet2Quit also builds on promising research on
health interventions that employ autocommunica-
tions, that is, text or email messages from health
experts that are sent automatically to participants to
encourage healthy behaviours.23–27 At least 13 rando-
mised controlled trials of autocommunication-based
interventions for smoking cessation have been con-
ducted, and the results have been promising.23 25
The results also suggest that fixed message schedules
perform better than decreasing or variable sche-
dules,28 so T
weet2Quit uses a fixed schedule.
T
weet2Quit is, in effect, a hybrid intervention
that
involves
both:
(1)
social
network-based,
peer-to-peer participant exchanges and (2) daily
autocommunications sent by the study website
posing treatment-relevant questions from experts
for participants to discuss. Our research hypothesis
was that T
weet2Quit would significantly increase
sustained abstinence, defined as 7-day point preva-
lence abstinence at 7, 30 and 60 days post-quit
date,29–31 relative to a usual care-control condition.

 study was conducted in four cohorts of 40 participants (total
N=160). Once 40 individuals were screened as eligible, they
were individually assigned using computer-generated 1:1 ran-
domisation to T
weet2Quit or the control condition. All partici-
pants received study-provided nicotine patches and referral to
the smokefree.gov smoking cessation website. Those receiving
the
T
weet2Quit
intervention
were
assigned
to
20-person,
100-day support groups on T
witter, in which smokers supported
each other to quit, encouraged and directed by twice-daily
autocommunications.
It took about 4 months to enrol each of our four cohorts of
40 persons. Recruitment and interventions occurred in 2012–
2013, and data were analysed in 2014–2015. The trial sample
size (N=160) was based on a power analysis informed by
autocommunication-based smoking cessation trials (details in
online supplementary material).
Study sample and recruitment
A national sample of US smokers was recruited using the Google
search engine and a US$10 000/month advertisement budget on
Google AdW
ords (see online supplementary material for details).
If smokers were interested in participating, they completed a
brief online interest form requesting their email. Then about
1 month before a projected cohort start date, they were emailed
a link to our screening survey to assess their eligibility and obtain
informed consent. Inclusion criteria were: resident of the contin-
ental USA, English speaking, aged 18–59 years, smoked 100+
cigarettes in lifetime, currently smoking ≥5 cigarettes daily, inten-
tion to quit smoking in the next month, active email account,
mobile phone with internet access and unlimited texting, weekly
texting, and daily Facebook use. The age range was 18–59 years
to be as inclusive as possible, while excluding two age groups that
were likely to have different lifestyles and cessation motivations:
minors for whom cigarette use is illegal and retired older adults.
Exclusion criteria were: health contraindications to nicotine
patch use; actively taking medication for depression, anxiety or
quitting smoking; illicit hard drug use in the past 4 weeks; daily
marijuana use; residence with another participant; failure to
provide contact or collateral information; and/or failure to
respond to a confirmatory text sent to their mobile phone. Our
university IRBs approved the research and participants con-
sented online.
In our T
weet2Quit pilot study, we found that daily Facebook
use was significantly correlated with engagement in T
weet2Quit,
while prior T
witter use was uncorrelated.32 Hence, for this clin-
ical trial, we required daily Facebook use, not T
witter use.
Nevertheless, we used T
witter as our technology platform
because, at the time, Facebook periodically changed its default
privacy settings without informing users, so we could not ensure
participants’ privacy on Facebook. Also, our website firm
required T
witter’s programming language (API) to set up a
website that would automate message delivery and downloading
of posts; Facebook’s API was inadequate.
Shared treatment components
Once a cohort was formed, we gave all participants study
website accounts using usernames and passwords provided at
screening. On the cohort’s official start date, all participants
were emailed instructions asking them to log into their study
website account and set a quit date within 7 days of the start
date. While clinical practice guidelines suggest setting a quit
date within 14 days of intervention start,22 our pilot testing
(N=40) showed that T
weet2Quit participants who delayed
setting their quit date until the second week also delayed
engaging with their groups, and were marginalised.32 Hence,
our shift to a 7-day quit window.
Also about a week before their cohort’s official start, partici-
pants received by mail a 56-day supply of nicotine patches that
was dosed per their baseline smoking level (starting with 14 mg
patches if <10 cigarettes/day and 21 mg patches if >10 cigar-
ettes/day).22 On their cohort start date, an automated email
encouraged participants to select a quit date and to start using
the patches on that date. Participants were also encouraged to
access
smokefree.gov,
the
National
Cancer
Institute’s
quit-smoking website. Automated emails sent smokefree.gov
module links as follows: day 1: Prepare to Quit, Quit date
+4 days:
Quitting,
day
8:
help
line/live
chat,
Quit
date
+13 days: Staying Quit, and day 22: help line/live chat. Our
study website included the same smokefree.gov links.
Tweet2Quit intervention
Unique to the intervention condition was enrolment in a
T
weet2Quit 20-person, 100-day, virtual peer support group.
The groups were closed in that each member followed and was
followed exclusively by other members, and no new members
were added. The groups were private, because only the group
members and the study staff could see the tweets. T
wenty
smokers were included per group, because, based on marketing
research, the average social network has about 17–20 active par-
ticipants.33 34 When we proposed to develop and test our inter-
vention, we expected it to last 60 days but, in our two pilot
groups, we let participants tweet as long as they liked, and they
tweeted for close to 100 days. Hence, for the subsequent rando-
mised controlled trial, the intervention duration was set at
100 days.
A few weeks before each cohort’s start, we set up the
T
weet2Quit participants with new T
witter accounts, using the
same emails and passwords as their study website accounts. W
e
set up new T
witter accounts to ensure the groups were private,
and as a safeguard so that we could close down an account if
problematic tweeting occurred, though it never did. No partici-
pant complained about having to use a new T
witter account.
Then, at the start of each cohort group, T
weet2Quit partici-
pants were sent an automated email that encouraged but did not
require them to start tweeting their group at least daily. They
were also emailed instructions to set up their mobile phones to
send and receive the tweets as texts because this required phys-
ical access to their phones. At the time of our study, T
witter
users could not set up detailed user profiles, but an automated
email encouraged, though did not require, them to post an
image or picture that represented them. T
weet2Quit participants
often directed their tweets to one or more specific group
members using the @ sign; however, T
witter automatically sent
each tweet to every group member, and the tweets permanently
showed up on the group’s T
witter feed in chronological order
showing sender, date and time.
T
weet2Quit participants also received daily discussion-topic
automessages and daily engagement autofeedback for 100 days,
using fully automated programmes that ran on our study
website. The discussion topic automessages were sent out at
17:00 Pacific (20:00 Eastern), worded as questions, and posted
as tweets on the group’s T
witter feed. One hundred messages
were developed by the research team based on clinical practice
guidelines.22 32 35 36 A separate paper describes the messages
and identifies those that supported behaviour change.32
At 9:00 Pacific (12:00 Eastern), participants received indivi-
dualised autofeedback on their prior 24 h tweeting. This was
sent via a text to each participant’s mobile phone to reach those

 not logging into T
witter. A custom programme automatically
downloaded the tweets every night, identified tweeters and non-
tweeters, and sent texts with varied wording. T
weeters were
praised (eg, ‘Great job staying connected with your quit
smoking group. Your tweets make a difference!’), while non-
tweeters were encouraged (eg, ‘Missed hearing from you yester-
day! Share how you are doing with your group’).
Measures
The online screening survey assessed participants’ eligibility, sex,
ethnicity, marital status, education, employment and cigarettes
smoked; and obtained contact information including mailing
address. An online baseline survey followed randomisation, and
measured years smoked, spousal smoking, past quit attempts,
past cessation aids, current abstinence goal,37 38 and Fagerström
Cigarette Dependence.39 40 Abstinence surveys were adminis-
tered at 7, 30 and 60 days post-quit date, as specified in our
funded
proposal
(survey
completion
rates
in
online
supplementary
material),
assessing
7-day
point
prevalence
abstinence based on two standard questions: ‘How many cigar-
ettes have you smoked in the past 7 days?’ and ‘Have you
puffed on a cigarette within the past 7 days?’29 31 These ques-
tions were emailed and texted to participants and, if there was
no response, they were called. The assessment texts came from
a different account and at a different time from the study auto-
communications, and participants were told the assessment data
would be kept confidential.
Sustained abstinence was recorded if a participant responded
to the 7, 30 and 60 day surveys, and consistently (across both
questions) reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence, that is,
not smoking for the prior 7 days.29–31 Sustained abstinence was
the designated end point because it was the more rigorous end
point, and the sample was recruited as motivated to quit.41
Non-sustained abstinence was recorded if a participant reported
smoking on any survey, regardless of the number of surveys
completed, otherwise, lost to follow-up was recorded (25/160,
15.6%). The timing of the abstinence surveys was based on the
quit dates that participants had recorded on the study website.
If no quit date was recorded, the last possible date was used.
Supplemental online surveys at 7, 30 and 60 days post-quit
date measured how many days participants used nicotine
patches, and how many times they visited smokefree.gov (survey
completion rates are in the online supplementary material).
T
weet2Quit tweeting methods (eg, phone, computer) were also
assessed among intervention participants. Setting a quit date
and posting an image for the T
weet2Quit user profile were
determined visually on the study website.
Finally, tweets were automatically downloaded daily into a
database that listed each tweet, the date and time sent, the ver-
batim message sent, the sender’s username, and each recipient’s
username if designated (eg, by @). Engagement, measured at
the participant level, was assessed using three metrics: (1) tweet
volume (ie, number of tweets each participant sent); (2) days of
tweeting (ie, number of days a participant sent at least one
tweet) and (3) tweeting duration, which compared the partici-
pant’s very first and last tweet dates.
Statistical analyses
Abstinence outcomes were analysed using generalised linear
modelling with generalised estimating equations to account for
clustering effects of cohorts (Proc Genmod, SAS V
.9.3). The first
model
estimated
the
effect
of
condition
(intervention
vs
control) on sustained abstinence after adjusting for cohort, and
the
interaction
of
condition-by-cohort.
Point
prevalence
abstinence over time was modelled similarly, but with assess-
ment point as an added factor (7, 30 or 60 days). A third multi-
variate model estimated the effects of demographic and tobacco
use variables on sustained abstinence after adjusting for condi-
tion, cohort and condition-by-cohort. Cohort was included
because of variability in cohort activity and engagement. The
primary outcome, sustained abstinence, included all randomised
participants with complete data (figure 1). T
wenty-five partici-
pants (15.6%, 25/160) were missing abstinence data at one or
more follow-ups. Secondary analyses examined sustained abstin-
ence with these 25 participants lost to follow-up imputed to be
smoking.41 42 Additionally, we analysed the 7-day point preva-
lence abstinence rates at each follow-up (ie, at 7, 30 and 60 days
post-quit date).
T
wo
additional
multivariate
models
used
data
from
T
weet2Quit participants only to examine mediators of treatment
effects. One model estimated the effects of tweet volume and
other tweeting-related variables on abstinence. A second model
estimated
the
effects
of
demographic,
tobacco
use
and
tweeting-related
variables
on
tweet
volume.
Both
models
adjusted for cohort. Variables with limited variability or high
correlations with other variables were not included in these
models.
RESULTS
Study participants
A total of 614 people completed the online interest form and
were sent the screening survey; 444 (72.31%) did not meet the
inclusion criteria, 10 were excluded because enrolment was
closed, and 160 were randomised to condition (figure 1).
Participants’ average age was 35.7 years (SD=9.9), 26.3% (42/
160) were male, 31.2% (50/160) had a college degree or higher,
and 88.7% (142/160) were Caucasian non-Hispanic. Of the
51.2% (82/160) who were married or partnered, 47.6% (39/82)
lived with a current smoker. At baseline, participants averaged
18.0 (SD=8.2) cigarettes daily, had smoked for 16.8 (SD=9.8)
years, had a moderate Fagerström score of 4.7 (SD=2.1), and
reported a median of 4 (IQR: 3–7) prior quit attempts of 1+
days. Most (67.6%, 94/139) had a resolute abstinence goal: I
want to quit smoking once and for all, and never smoke ever
again. Table 1 provides additional details.
Sustained abstinence
Analysis of complete cases indicated sustained abstinence out to
60 days post-quit date of 40.00% (26/65) in the T
weet2Quit
condition versus 20.00% (14/70) in the control condition,
OR=2.67, CI 1.19 to 5.99, p=0.017 (table 2). In an analysis
with incomplete cases, imputing participants lost to follow-up
as smoking,41 sustained abstinence was 32.50% (26/80) for
T
weet2Quit versus 17.50% (14/80) for control, OR=2.27, CI
1.04 to 4.97, p=0.039. In both analyses, there was a consistent
effect for T
weet2Quit versus control across cohorts.
Analysis of 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates over time
also showed a significant effect for condition that favoured
T
weet2Quit over control, OR=1.89, CI 1.10 to 3.25, p=0.021.
Imputing lost to follow-up as smoking, the point prevalence
abstinence rates at 7, 30 and 60 days post-quit date were
41.25% (33/80), 57.50% (46/80) and 55.00% (44/80) for
T
weet2Quit,
versus
37.50% (30/80), 38.75%
(31/80) and
41.25% (33/80) for control, respectively.
Treatment usage
A quit date was set by 81.3% (130/160) of participants, with no
difference by condition (p=0.105). Over a third (37.5%, 60/

 160) of participants chose day 1, 31.9% (51/160) chose days 2–
7 and 30.6% (49/160) chose or were assigned the last day. Of
the 30 participants who failed to set a quit date, only one
reported sustained abstinence. At 7 days post-quit date, 95.1%
(97/102) of participants reported using the nicotine patch at
least once, and 35.3% (36/102) reported visiting the smokefree.
gov website at least once (detailed in table 2).
Tweeting behaviours
Among T
weet2Quit participants, 53.8% (43/80) posted an
image for their user profile, 67.2% (39/58) reported tweeting
on a mobile phone using texting, and 75.9% (44/58) reported
tweeting at work. Three-quarters (60/80) of T
weet2Quit partici-
pants tweeted at least once, and total tweets per group averaged
1177
(SD=275,
range=825–1489).
On
average,
each
T
weet2Quit participant sent 58.8 tweets (SD=68.1, range=0–
324, median=34.5), tweeted for a duration of 47.4 days from
first to last tweet (SD=38.9, range=0–95, median=47.5), and
tweeted
on
22.9
different
days
(SD=24.0,
range=0–87,
median=16.0). Each T
weet2Quit participant who tweeted at
least once (N=60) sent on average 78.4 (SD=68.1) tweets, for a
duration of 63.2 days (SD=31.7), and on 30.3 (SD=23.4) dif-
ferent days.
The daily T
weet2Quit autocommunications caused tweeting
spikes within an hour after delivery that accounted for 24.0%
(1130/4705) of all tweets, including 12.1% (572/4705) that
occurred within an hour after the 17:00 PST discussion-topic
automessages, and 11.9% (558/4705) that occurred within an
hour after the 9:00 PST engagement autofeedback (vs 3.5% or
163/4705/h otherwise, F(1,88)=69.29, p<0.001; see online
supplementary figure S1). However, 50.5% (2376/4705) of the
tweets were directed to the entire group, and 33.5% (1576/
4705) were directed to one or more specific members; just
16.0% (753/4705) were directed to the account that sent the
automessages.
Predictors of sustained abstinence and tweet volume
No measured demographic or tobacco use variable interacted
significantly with study condition to affect abstinence. As signifi-
cant main effects, men and participants reporting a resolute
abstinence goal at baseline were more likely to achieve sustained
abstinence than women and participants with a less resolute
abstinence goal (table 3).
Among T
weet2Quit participants, tweet volume related signifi-
cantly to sustained abstinence (OR=1.02, CI 1.02 to 1.03,
p<0.001), with each additional 10 tweets increasing the twe-
eter’s
odds
of
sustained
abstinence
by
20%
on
average.
Significant predictors of tweet volume or engagement were
posting an image for the T
weet2Quit user profile, tweeting on a
mobile phone with texting, tweeting while at work, and having
a college degree (table 3).
T
weet
volume
exhibited
exponential
decline
over
time
(R2=0.73, p<0.001; see online supplementary figure S2).
Notwithstanding, T
weet2Quit participants who reported sus-
tained abstinence, versus not, tweeted longer (F(1,63)=13.77,
p<0.001) and more (F(1,63)=25.62, p<0.001). On average,

Predictors of study retention
For the full sample, no measured variable significantly related to
study retention, that is, completion of assessments. Among
T

88.3% (53/60) who tweeted the group at least once completed
the follow-up assessments versus 60.0% (12/20) of non-tweeters
(p=0.005); and 90.7% (39/43) who posted an image for their

 DISCUSSION
Our social network intervention, T
weet2Quit, doubled the odds
of
self-reported
sustained
smoking
abstinence
to
60 days
follow-up, when added to the usual care of nicotine patches and
a quit-smoking website. Moreover, engagement in T
weet2Quit
was high with most participants tweeting for an extended dur-
ation; and engagement related to abstinence. Because smokers
were randomly assigned to T
weet2Quit versus control, the evi-
dence suggests a causal effect for T
weet2Quit on abstinence.
T
weet2Quit did not affect nicotine patch use or use of the
quit-smoking website, so the mechanism of action seems to be
tweeting and social network support from the groups.
Contributions to the literature
This is one of the first experimental studies to examine T
witter
as a delivery mechanism for a health prevention intervention.
Prior observational research found that existing T
witter and
Facebook self-help groups were short-lived,2 and the content
was often questionable.2 7 Hence, we customised T
witter using
two promising ideas from past research. Peer-support studies
suggested that smokers might benefit from buddies they can quit
with,19–21 and technology studies indicated smokers might
benefit from automated, fixed schedule text messages from
experts.23–28 W
e combined these two approaches in T
weet2Quit
and our results are promising, though further research is needed
for replication and extension beyond short-term outcomes.
Clinical implications
Our results have implications for the utilisation of social net-
works for clinical interventions. Key features here were the for-
mation of private self-help groups, using an intimate group size
of about 20 people, setting fixed start and end dates, using a
limited-duration intervention, and sending out autocommunica-
tions including daily discussion topics to the group and daily
feedback to each individual on their prior 24 h engagement.
Limitations and future research
In this initial T
weet2Quit study, our abstinence measure was
short term (60 days), measured before intervention end, and
self-reported. Planned next steps are a larger trial with longer
follow-up and bioconfirmed abstinence. Very few eHealth
studies have used bioconfirmed abstinence because of difficulties
in obtaining biosamples,43 and research indicating self-reports
can provide accurate estimates of smoking status.44 W
e also used
a small sample that was largely non-Hispanic Caucasian and
female. This may be attributable to recruitment which empha-
sised nicotine patches and social support as incentives. W
e also
screened for daily Facebook use, because in our pilot, this pre-
dicted engagement. While consistent with personalised or preci-
sion medicine,45 this limits participation, although Facebook
reports over 968 million daily users as of June 2015 (about
73% of online adults).10
Consistent with many prior smoking cessation trials with
nicotine replacement, we observed that men were significantly
more likely to quit than women.46 However, both genders were
highly engaged in T
weet2Quit. In future research, we hope to
examine why women were less successful quitters and try to
improve their odds. W
e are also adapting our intervention for
other disease prevention efforts, for example, promoting phys-
ical activity in women with heart disease.

What this paper adds
▸ Social network sites allow people who are geographically
separated but connected by interests to communicate
interactively, at virtually no cost, often in real time and on
mobile devices.
▸ However, the potential for social network sites to host
self-help groups for quitting smoking has not yet been
realised because, generally, engagement is too low, and
paid group facilitators are too costly.
▸ This study finds that a 100-day social network-based
intervention can significantly improve the odds of smoking
abstinence out to 60 days.
▸ The intervention is called Tweet2Quit, and it employs a
two-pronged approach: (1) using Twitter, it sets up small,
private, virtual self-help groups of smokers who are
motivated to quit and (2) it sends out daily automated
messages posing treatment-relevant questions written by
experts for smokers to discuss.
▸ The intervention is very low cost and highly scalable, and
the findings hold promise for delivering low-cost tobacco
treatments globally.
