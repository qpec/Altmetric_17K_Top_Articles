Summary
Background Long-term hormone therapy has been the standard of care for advanced prostate cancer since the 1940s. 
STAMPEDE is a randomised controlled trial using a multiarm, multistage platform design. It recruits men with high-
risk, locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent prostate cancer who are starting  
fi
 rst-line long-term hormone therapy. 
We report primary survival results for three research comparisons testing the addition of zoledronic acid, docetaxel, 
or their combination to standard of care versus standard of care alone.
Methods Standard of care was hormone therapy for at least 2 years; radiotherapy was encouraged for men with 
N0M0 disease to November, 2011, then mandated; radiotherapy was optional for men with node-positive non-
metastatic (N+M0) disease. Stratifi
 ed randomisation (via minimisation) allocated men 2:1:1:1 to standard of care 
only (SOC-only; control), standard of care plus zoledronic acid (SOC + ZA), standard of care plus docetaxel 
(SOC + Doc), or standard of care with both zoledronic acid and docetaxel (SOC + ZA + Doc). Zoledronic acid (4 mg) 
was given for six 3-weekly cycles, then 4-weekly until 2 years, and docetaxel (75 mg/m²) for six 3-weekly cycles with 
prednisolone 10 mg daily. There was no blinding to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was 
overall survival. Pairwise comparisons of research versus control had 90% power at 2·5% one-sided α for hazard 
ratio (HR) 0·75, requiring roughly 400 control arm deaths. Statistical analyses were undertaken with standard log-
rank-type methods for time-to-event data, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs derived from adjusted Cox 
models. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00268476) and ControlledTrials.com (ISRCTN78818544).
Findings 2962 men were randomly assigned to four groups between Oct 5, 2005, and March 31, 2013. Median age was 
65 years (IQR 60–71). 1817 (61%) men had M+ disease, 448 (15%) had N+/X M0, and 697 (24%) had N0M0. 165 (6%) 
men were previously treated with local therapy, and median prostate-specifi
 c antigen was 65 ng/mL (IQR 23–184). 
Median follow-up was 43 months (IQR 30–60). There were 415 deaths in the control group (347 [84%] prostate 
cancer). Median overall survival was 71 months (IQR 32 to not reached) for SOC-only, not reached (32 to not reached) 
for SOC + ZA (HR 0·94, 95% CI 0·79–1·11; p=0·450), 81 months (41 to not reached) for SOC + Doc (0·78, 0·66–0·93; 
p=0·006), and 76 months (39 to not reached) for SOC + ZA + Doc (0·82, 0·69–0·97; p=0·022). There was no evidence 
of heterogeneity in treatment eff
 ect (for any of the treatments) across prespecifi
 ed subsets. Grade 3–5 adverse events 
were reported for 399 (32%) patients receiving SOC, 197 (32%) receiving SOC + ZA, 288 (52%) receiving SOC + Doc, 
and 269 (52%) receiving SOC + ZA + Doc.
Interpretation Zoledronic acid showed no evidence of survival improvement and should not be part of standard of 
care for this population. Docetaxel chemotherapy, given at the time of long-term hormone therapy initiation, showed 
evidence of improved survival accompanied by an increase in adverse events. Docetaxel treatment should become 
part of standard of care for adequately fi
 t men commencing long-term hormone therapy.

Introduction
Since October, 2005, the STAMPEDE randomised 
controlled trial has recruited men with metastatic (M1), 
high-risk localised (N0), or node-positive (N+) prostate 
cancer who were newly diagnosed or had high-risk 
recurrent disease following previous local therapy. All were 
commencing fi
 rst-line long-term hormone therapy. 
Prognosis for these patient groups had altered little since 
the fi
 rst description of the eff
 ects of hormone therapy in 
the 1940s. This began to change in the early 21st century 
with licensing of agents that improved survival 
(ie, docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, 
radium-223, and sipuleucel-T),1–8 and disease-modifying 
agents that reduced morbidity (zoledronic acid and 
denosumab).9,10 However, these agents have all shown their 
benefi
 ts in the setting of castrate-refractory prostate cancer 
(ie, after fi
 rst-line hormone therapy has ceased working).
STAMPEDE uses a multiarm, multistage (MAMS) 
platform design to test whether the addition of 
treatments at the time of long-term hormone therapy 
initiation improves overall survival. Here, we evaluate 
and report fi
 ndings for zoledronic acid and docetaxel; 
data for celecoxib, abiraterone, enzalutamide in 
combination with abiraterone, and (in patients with 
newly diagnosed metastatic disease only) prostate 
radiotherapy will be reported elsewhere. We have 
previously reported the celecoxib-containing groups 
which closed to recruitment early after a pre-planned 
second intermediate analysis failed to show suffi
  cient 
eff
 ect on failure-free survival.11 We have also previously 
reported control group outcome data for patients with 
metastatic12 and non-metastatic13 disease. We report here 
the fi
 rst survival data for the following original groups 
in this platform trial: zoledronic acid, docetaxel, and 
their combination. Other trials have also examined 
similar strategies, both in patients with non-metastatic 
disease and in those with metastatic disease, usually 
with single drugs. A meta-analysis with other docetaxel 
and 
zoledronic 
acid-containing 
trials 
has 
been 
conducted and is reported separately.14
Zoledronic acid was licensed in 2002 on the basis of an 
improvement in a composite outcome measure of time 
to fi
 rst skeletal-related event, with a risk ratio of 0·64 
(95% CI 0·49 to 0·85) in castrate-refractory prostate 
cancer, and subsequent reduction in further skeletal-
related events using the 4 mg schedule.9 There was 
limited evidence of a benefi
 t in survival, although the 
study was underpowered. Two previous UK trials, PR04 
and PR05, used sodium clodronate in patients with non-
metastatic and metastatic disease, respectively. The PR05 
trial showed improved survival with concurrent hormone 
therapy plus clodronate but no evidence of benefi
 t was 
seen in PR04.15
Docetaxel (75 mg/m²) 3-weekly (ie, given every 3 weeks) 
was licensed for metastatic castrate-refractory prostate 
cancer in 2004, on the basis of two trials comparing 
mitoxantrone and prednisone with docetaxel and either 
prednisone2 or estramustine.1 The median survival 
benefi
 t observed was about 3 months, with a hazard ratio 
(HR) of 0·76 (0·62–0·94)2 for docetaxel compared with 
mitoxantrone.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Systemic treatment has changed little for newly diagnosed 
men with high-risk locally advanced or metastatic prostate 
cancer since the development of gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone analogues a generation ago. The only major change 
has been the use of radical radiotherapy for men whose disease 
had not spread. This century, new agents began to show 
valuable activity in relapsed, metastatic, castrate-refractory 
prostate cancer—including zoledronic acid, which was 
approved in 2002 on the basis of reduced morbidity in men 
with bone metastases (a site of spread in up to 90% of 
castrate-refractory prostate cancer), and docetaxel, with 
improved survival demonstrated in 2004. Several other trials in 
addition to STAMPEDE have assessed both drugs in the newly 
diagnosed setting, most notably GETUG-15 and CHAARTED, 
which assessed docetaxel in the metastatic setting (about 60% 
of the population used in our trial). A systematic review and 
meta-analysis was done in parallel to preparation of this report 
and contains details of the review strategy.
Added value of this study
Our results for zoledronic acid show no convincing evidence of 
worthwhile benefi
 t either on failure-free or overall survival. 
These results are congruent with emerging results from other 
trials in men starting long-term hormone therapy. The 
docetaxel results showed an improvement in overall survival 
(HR 0·78; 95% CI 0·66–0·93; p=0·006). There was a notable 
improvement in survival for the metastatic subset, which is 
consistent with fi
 ndings from GETUG-15 and CHAARTED which 
both also showed gains in failure-free survival with docetaxel. 
GETUG-15 showed a non-signifi
 cant improvement in overall 
survival, and CHAARTED reported a statistically signifi
 cant 
improvement in overall survival.
Implications of all the available evidence
Together, these trials provide evidence that six cycles of 
docetaxel should be added to standard androgen deprivation 
therapy for men with metastatic disease commencing 
treatment. Men with non-metastatic disease had better 
prognoses, and failure-free survival was clearly improved by 
docetaxel; however, there were relatively few deaths in those 
with non-metastatic disease, so statements about overall 
survival in this population remain underpowered.

The STAMPEDE trial16,17 used interim activity analyses, 
based on failure-free survival, to select groups to continue 
accrual for fully powered survival analysis. We report 
here overall, failure-free, and prostate-cancer-specifi
 c 
survival data from the zoledronic acid and docetaxel 
groups and their combination, together with adverse 
event data and treatment after relapse.
Methods
Study design and participants
We 
used 
a 
MAMS 
platform 
trial 
approach, 
incorporating a seamless phase 2/3 design.18 The 
rationale and design have been described previously.16,17,19 
Full details are in the protocol. In summary, eligible 
patients had prostate cancer that was newly diagnosed 
as metastatic, node positive, or high-risk locally 
advanced (with at least two of T3/4, Gleason score of 
8–10, and prostate-specifi
 c antigen ≥40 ng/mL); or 
previously treated with radical surgery, radiotherapy, or 
both and relapsing with high-risk features. All patients 
were intended for long-term hormone therapy, started 
no longer than 12 weeks before randomisation. There 
were no age restrictions; patients were required to be 
fi
 t for chemotherapy with no clinically signifi
 cant 
cardiovascular history.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomised centrally using a computerised 
algorithm, developed and maintained by the trials unit. 
Minimisation with a random element of 80% was used, 
stratifying for hospital, age at randomisation, presence of 
metastases, planned radiotherapy use, nodal involvement, 
WHO performance status, planned hormone therapy, 
and regular use of aspirin or another non-steroidal anti-
infl
 ammatory drug. Allocation was in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to 
standard of care only (SOC-only), standard of care plus 
zoledronic acid (SOC + ZA), standard of care plus 
docetaxel (SOC + Doc), or standard of care plus zoledronic 
acid and docetaxel (SOC + ZA + Doc). Masking to 
treatment allocation was considered impracticable and of 
limited value given the primary outcome measure.
Procedures
Standard of care was hormone therapy for at least 2 years 
with 
gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone 
agonists 
or 
antagonists or, only between 2006 and 2011 for patients 
with non-metastatic disease, oral anti-androgens alone. 
Orchidectomy was an allowable alternative to drug therapy. 
No recommendations around the use of granulocyte 
colony stimulating factor with docetaxel were given. 
Radiotherapy, at 6–9 months after randomisation, was

encouraged for patients with N0M0 disease, until 
November, 2011, then mandated; radiotherapy was optional 
for patients with N+M0 disease; staging was with the 
Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM 
staging criteria. Guidance on radiotherapy techniques are 
described elsewhere.13 Zoledronic acid (4 mg) was given for 
six 3-weekly cycles, then 4-weekly until 2 years. Docetaxel 
(75 mg/m²) was given for six 3-weekly cycles with 
prednisolone (10 mg) daily, and standard premedication 
before each injection. Dose modifi
 cations were described 
in the protocol. Trial therapy was discontinued after disease 
progression or intolerable adverse events.
Patients were followed up 6-weekly to 6 months, 
12-weekly to 2 years, 6-monthly to 5 years, then annually. 
Prostate-specifi
 c antigen was measured at every follow-
up; further tests were at the clinician’s discretion. Nadir 
prostate-specifi
 c antigen was the lowest value reported 
within 24 weeks after enrolment. Adverse events were 
graded with Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) 
version 3.0; toxic eff
 ects and symptoms were reported at 
regular follow-up visits. Serious adverse events, including 
serious adverse reactions, were reported accordingly. The 
trial was done in accordance with Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki, and had the 
relevant regulatory and ethics approvals (eg, in the UK 
we obtained national ethics approval, national regulatory 
approval, and local implementation). All patients gave 
written, informed consent.
Outcomes
The defi
 nitive and intermediate primary outcome measures 
were overall survival and failure-free survival, respectively. 
Overall survival was defi
 ned as time from randomisation to 
death from any cause. Failure-free survival, which is 
commonly used to drive decisions in the clinic, was selected 
because it is on the causal pathway to death from prostate 
cancer and was not required to be a surrogate for overall 
survival. It was defi
 ned as time from randomisation to fi
 rst 
evidence of at least one of: biochemical failure; progression 
either locally, in lymph nodes, or in distant metastases; or 
death from prostate cancer. Biochemical failure was defi
 ned 
as a rise of 50% above the within-24-week nadir and above 
4 ng/mL and confi
 rmed by retest or treatment.12 We 
expected prostate-specifi
 c antigen failure to be the most 
common manifestation of failure-free survival events. 
Cause of death was determined by masked central review. 
Death from prostate cancer was recorded when classifi
 ed 
by the reviewer as “defi
 nitely” or “probably” prostate cancer. 
The site investigator’s determination was used for deaths 
not yet reviewed.
Statistical analysis
The sample size was calculated using nstage and its 
predecessor programmes in Stata, which enables design 
of MAMS trials.20 Assuming, for the control group, 
2 years’ median failure-free survival, and median overall 
survival between 4 and 5 years, we targeted a 25% relative

improvement (HR 0·75) in both failure-free survival and 
overall survival for each comparison of research group 
with control. Accumulating data were reviewed by an 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee, guided by 
lack-of-benefi
 t stopping guidelines.16–18 The effi
  cacy stage 
analysis of each pairwise comparison of research against 
control for overall survival required around 400 deaths in 
the control arm for 90% power and 2·5% one-sided α 
(corresponding to a two-sided α of 5%), accounting for 
three intermediate analyses on failure-free survival 
(analysed March, 2010, April, 2011, and May, 2012). The 
research groups within STAMPEDE were seen to test 
distinct hypotheses, and the trial was purposely not 
designed as a factorial trial.17 In this situation, many 
methodologists would not be concerned about the family-
wise error rate.3,21–23 However, for completeness we 
calculated the maximum family-wise error rate as 6·75% 
for these three research groups.
Patients without the event of interest were censored at 
the time last known to be event free. Standard survival 
analysis methods were used to analyse time-to-event data. 
Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to 
estimate most relative treatment eff
 ects. This model was 
adjusted for stratifi
 cation factors (except hospital and 
planned hormone therapy), and stratifi
 ed by time periods 
defi
 ned by addition of a new research group or end in 
recruitment to an ongoing research group. An HR below 
1·00 favoured the research group. Flexible parametric 
models were constructed with 4 degrees of freedom for 
each of the baseline hazard function and time-dependent 
eff
 ect, and adjusted for stratifi
 cation factors and time 
periods.24 Medians and 5-year estimates come from the 
fl
 exible parametric model fi
 tted to the data; these are 
more reliable than reading the Kaplan-Meier curves. The 
proportional hazards assumption was tested; restricted 
mean survival time was emphasised in the presence of 
non-proportionality. Fine and Gray regression models 
were used for competing risk analysis of prostate-cancer-
specifi
 c survival (non-metastatic prostate-cancer-specifi
 c 
survival analyses did not adjust for time period due to 
lack of convergence). Prespecifi
 ed analyses looked at 
consistency of treatment eff
 ect within stratifi
 cation 
factors, over time period, and also by categorised Gleason 
score (≤7, 8+, unknown), recurrent disease, and prostate-
specifi
 c antigen values before hormone therapy. The 
statistical analysis plan was modifi
 ed to include an 
analysis of the subset of patients with metastatic disease 
at randomisation after the presentation of CHAARTED25 
and GETUG-1526 and before this primary analysis was 
performed. All tests were two-sided, with confi
 dence 
intervals given at the 95% level.
Median follow-up was determined through the standard 
approach of reverse-censoring on death, in which survival 
is treated as the event and death as censoring. All patients 
are included in the effi
  cacy analyses according to allocated 
treatment on an intention-to-treat basis. Adverse event 
data are shown for the safety population, comprising 
patients who received any study drug and underwent 
adverse event assessment, and analysed according to 
treatment initiated irrespective of study group assignment; 
a sensitivity analysis of safety was done on an intention-to-
treat basis. Safety data were assessed continuously; we also 
present a safety analysis at 1 year, chosen to assess whether 
chemotherapy side-eff
 ects had ameliorated by this 
timepoint. A formal comparison of those research groups

was done, and a pre-planned factorial analysis (without an 
interaction term) is included for completeness. Data on 
fi
 rst skeletal-related event and osteonecrosis of the jaw are 
also presented. All other analyses are exploratory. Statistical 
analyses were done with Stata version 14 and nstage. The 
trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00268476) and 
ControlledTrials.com (ISRCTN78818544).
Role of the funding source
The trial was sponsored by the MRC and conducted by the 
MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL with the Swiss Group for 
Clinical Cancer Research. MRC employees were central to 
the conduct of the trial and the development of this 
manuscript. Only authors MRSp and MRSy had access to 
raw data; processed data released by the Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee and Trial Steering Committee 
were available to all coauthors. Cancer Research UK (MRC 
PR08, CRUK/06/019) approved, but had no further input 
into, the trial design. Pfi
 zer, Novartis, and Sanofi
 -Aventis 
approved the initial and amended trial design and 
participated in discussions on the progress of the trial. 
Representatives from these industry partners were invited 
to comment on the report. The analyses were driven by 
prespecifi
 ed criteria and the decision to submit for 
publication was made by the Trial Management Group.
Results
Between Oct 5, 2005, and March 31, 2013, 2962 patients 
were randomised from more than 100 UK and Swiss 
sites: 1184 to SOC-only, 593 SOC + ZA, 592 SOC + Doc, 
and 593 SOC + ZA + Doc. Data were frozen on May 13, 
2015, with a cutoff
  of March 4, 2015. The appendix shows 
an overview of the broader trial design and groups 
recruiting over time, whereas fi
 gure 1 shows the 
CONSORT fl
 ow diagram for analyses presented here. 
Table 1 gives baseline characteristics of these patients. 
Median follow-up was 43 months (IQR 30–60). Most 
patients (94%) were newly diagnosed. 1738 (62%) of 
2797 newly diagnosed patients had metastatic disease at 
entry, compared with 79 (48%) of 165 patients with 
recurrent disease. Median age was 65 years (IQR 60–71), 
median prostate-specifi
 c antigen 65 ng/mL (IQR 23–184), 
and 2092 (71%) patients were Gleason score 8–10.
Median time to starting zoledronic acid was about 
2 weeks after randomisation, and about 8 weeks from 
starting hormone therapy (most patients started hormone 
therapy before randomisation). Median duration of 
zoledronic acid was 16·6 months (IQR 7·8–23·2) for 
SOC + ZA and 19·5 months (IQR 9·1–23·4) for 
SOC + ZA + Doc, with the diff
 erence in duration being 
driven by diff
 erences in time to progression (table 2). Of 
patients allocated to receive zoledronic acid as part of trial 
treatment, overall about 40% of patients completed 2 years 
of zoledronic acid therapy (table 2). When less than 2 years 
of treatment was received, progression was the most 
common reason for stopping. Zoledronic acid was not 
started in eight (1%) patients assigned to SOC + ZA and 
49 (8%) patients assigned to SOC + ZA + Doc, mostly due 
to treatment refusal.
Median time to starting docetaxel was about 2 weeks 
after randomisation and 9 weeks after starting hormone 
therapy. Of patients allocated to receive docetaxel as part 
of trial treatment, 456 (77%) patients assigned to 
SOC + Doc and 422 (71%) to SOC + ZA + Doc received the 
full six cycles, whereas 477 (81%) assigned to SOC + Doc 
and 446 (75%) to SOC + ZA + Doc received at least fi
 ve 
cycles (table 3). When fi
 ve or fewer cycles were reported, 
toxic eff
 ects were the most common reason for stopping 
(table 3), with few patients reporting stopping for disease 
progression. Docetaxel was not started in 46 (8%) patients

assigned to SOC + Doc and 70 (12%) to SOC + ZA + Doc, 
again mostly due to treatment refusal, patient choice, or 
withdrawal from the trial.
Planned use of standard of care radiotherapy was 
similar across groups (28–29%), with reported use being 
323 (27%) patients for SOC-only; 155 (26%) for SOC + ZA; 
154 
(26%) 
for 
SOC + Doc; 
and 
148 
(25%) 
for 
SOC + ZA + Doc. In patients with non-metastatic disease, 
62% 
were 
planned 
for 
radiotherapy, 
with 
the 
corresponding fi
 gures for reported use being 289 (63%) 
for SOC-only, 136 (60%) for SOC + ZA, 131 (57%) for 
SOC + Doc, and 130 (57%) for SOC + ZA + Doc; higher 
proportions of N0 than N+ patients received radiotherapy 
(appendix page 9).
There were 415 deaths (347 prostate cancer deaths; 
84%) in patients receiving SOC-only; median survival 
was 71 months (IQR 32 to not reached) and 5-year 
survival was 55%. These data form the reference for each 
comparison of research group with control.
201 patients in the SOC + ZA group died (169 prostate 
cancer; 84%), with no evidence of a survival advantage 
compared with SOC-only (HR 0·94, 95% CI 0·79–1·11; 
p=0·450); median survival was not reached (IQR 32 to 
not reached), and 5-year survival was 57%. However, 
there was evidence of a survival advantage for SOC + Doc 
(HR 0·78, 95% CI 0·66–0·93; p=0·006) with 175 deaths 
(143 prostate cancer; 82%), median survival 81 months 
(IQR 41 to not reached), and 5-year survival of 63%. 
There was also evidence of survival advantage for 
SOC + ZA + Doc (HR 0·82, 95% CI 0·69–0·97; p=0·022) 
with 187 deaths (150 prostate cancer; 80%), median 
survival 76 months (IQR 39 to not reached), and 5-year 
survival of 60%. There was no evidence of non-
proportional hazards. Plots for survival are shown in 
fi
 gure 2.
We found no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment 
eff
 ect across predefi
 ned subsets (fi
 gure 3). Pre-planned 
subset analyses in all 1817 patients with metastatic 
disease at randomisation included around 500 deaths per 
comparison. This included 350 deaths in patients on 
SOC-only (median survival 45 months [IQR 23–91], 
5-year survival 39%). There were 170 deaths on SOC + ZA 
(HR 0·93, 95% CI 0·77–1·11; p=0·416), with median 
survival 46 months (IQR 24 to not reached) and 5-year 
survival of 43%. There were 144 deaths on SOC + Doc 
(HR 0·76, 95% CI 0·62–0·92; p=0·005), with median 
survival 60 months (IQR 27–103) and 5-year survival of 
50% (appendix page 5). Finally, there were 158 deaths on 
SOC + ZA + Doc (HR 0·79, 95% CI 0·66–0·96; p=0·015), 
with median survival 55 months (IQR 29–88) and 5-year 
survival of 46%. Similar comparisons in patients without 
metastatic disease at randomisation are immature at this 
time, with fewer than 100 deaths per comparison.
Comparing the two research groups that demonstrated a 
survival advantage over the control group (SOC + Doc and 
SOC + ZA + Doc), we noted no evidence of an advantage 
when adding zoledronic acid to docetaxel (HR 1·06, 95% CI 
0·86–1·30; p=0·592). In an exploratory analysis of the 
eff
 ect of docetaxel on survival in the context of zoledronic 
acid (ie, comparing SOC + ZA with SOC + ZA + Doc), the 
hazard ratio was 0·87 (95% CI 0·71–1·06). Analysis of the 
main eff
 ects of zoledronic acid and docetaxel in a single 
factorial model, without a treatment-interaction term, 
showed docetaxel to be associated with a survival advantage 
(HR 0·82, 95% CI 0·72–0·93; p=0·003), but not zoledronic 
acid (HR 0·98, 95% CI 0·86–1·11; p=0·726). An exploratory 
factorial model, including an interaction term, found no 
evidence of treatment interaction (p=0·401); the individual 
treatment eff
 ects were the same as in the pairwise 
comparisons.
Figure 2 shows the failure-free survival plot for each 
research comparison, and the appendix page 10 shows 
the form of that failure-free survival event. There were 
761 events in patients on SOC-only; median failure-free 
survival 20 months; 5-year failure-free survival 28%. 
With 374 events there was no evidence of improvement 
in failure-free survival with SOC + ZA (HR 0·92, 95% CI 
0·81–1·04; p=0·198); median failure-free survival was 
22 months and 5-year failure-free survival was 31%.

There was, however, evidence of an improvement in 
failure-free survival both for SOC + Doc, with 315 events 
(HR 0·61, 95% CI 0·53–0·70; p=0·413 × 10–¹³), median 
failure-free survival 37 months, and 5-year failure-free 
survival 38%; and for SOC + ZA + Doc, with 318 events 
(HR 0·62, 95% CI 0·54–0·70; p=0·134 × 10–¹²), median 
failure-free survival 36 months, 5-year failure-free 
survival 34%. There was strong evidence of non-
proportional hazards for both comparisons showing an 
improvement in failure-free survival (SOC + Doc and 
SOC + ZA + Doc). In these cases, restricted mean survival 
time is preferred to the hazard ratio for summarising the 
treatment eff
 ect. Mean failure-free survival, restricted to 
the fi
 rst 84 months on trial, was 34·8 months on SOC-
only, compared to 44·2 months on SOC + Doc (diff
 erence 
9·4 months, 95% CI 6·6–12·3; p=0·556 × 10–¹⁰) and 
compared to 43·1 months on SOC + ZA + Doc (diff
 erence 
8·3 months, 95% CI 5·5–11·1; p=0·480 × 10–⁸).

As with survival, there was no evidence of heterogeneity 
in failure-free survival across the same predefi
 ned 
subsets (appendix page 3). Considering metastatic status 
subsets, treatment eff
 ect was broadly consistent within 
both non-metastatic and metastatic populations, for all 
research comparisons, and indicated that docetaxel 
improved failure-free survival for non-metastatic disease 
(HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·45–0·80; p=0·283 × 10–³) as for 
metastatic disease (HR 0·61, 95% CI 0·53–0·71; 
p=0·283 × 10–¹⁰).
At the time of this analysis, a total of 978 men had died, 
809 (83%) from prostate cancer. The proportion of deaths 
attributed to prostate cancer was increased in men 
presenting with metastases: 703 (86%) of 822 deaths in 
the 1817 men presenting with metastases, compared with 
106 (68%) of 156 deaths in 1145 men presenting without 
metastases. Adjusted competing risks regression for 
prostate-cancer-specifi
 c survival showed an advantage 
over SOC-only for SOC + Doc (subHR 0·79, 95% CI 
0·65–0·96; 
p=0·019) 
and 
SOC + ZA + Doc 
(0·78, 
0·65–0·95; p=0·013), but not SOC + ZA (0·95, 0·79–1·15; 
p=0·613). For patients with metastatic disease, the 
subHR for SOC + Doc was 0·80 (95% CI 0·65–0·99; 
p=0·033), for SOC + ZA was 0·92 (0·75–1·12), and for 
SOC + ZA + Doc was 0·78 (0·64–0·96); for patients with 
non-metastatic disease, the subHR for SOC + Doc was 
0·82 (95% CI 0·48–1·40; p=0·475), for SOC + ZA was 
1·08 (0·66–1·76), and for SOC + ZA + Doc was 0·81 
(CI 0·46–1·43). We noted particularly limited power for 
subset analyses at this time for both settings.
Amongst patients randomly assigned to SOC-only, 
328 of 1184 reported at least one skeletal-related event. 
Time to fi
 rst skeletal-related event was improved with 
SOC + Doc (112 patients reported skeletal-related event; 
HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·48–0·74; p=0·127 × 10–⁵) and 
SOC + ZA + Doc (108 patients; HR 0·55, 95% CI 
0·44–0·69; 
p=0·277 × 10–⁷), 
but 
not 
SOC + ZA 
(153 patients; HR 0·89, 95% CI 0·73–1·07; p=0·221). 
There was strong evidence of non-proportional hazards 
for both comparisons showing improvement in 
time to fi
 rst skeletal-related event (SOC + Doc and 
SOC + ZA + Doc). In these cases, restricted mean survival 
time is preferred for summarising treatment eff
 ect. 
Mean time to skeletal-related event, restricted to within 
the fi
 rst 84 months on trial, was 61·4 months (95% CI 
59·5–63·2) on SOC-only, compared with 68·0 months 
on SOC + Doc (diff
 erence 6·6 months, 95% CI 3·6–9·6;

(diff
 erence 6·9 months, 95% CI 4·1–9·8; p=0·249 × 10–⁵). 
In the patient group with bone metastases at presentation, 
SOC + ZA similarly had no evidence of an eff
 ect 
(HR 0·94, 95% CI 0·76–1·16; p=0·564).
Figure 4 shows time to fi
 rst of any treatment after a 
failure-free survival event and time to fi
 rst life-extending 
therapy (defi
 ned as available agents with proven survival 
gain in castrate-refractory prostate cancer: docetaxel, 
abiraterone, cabazitaxel, enzalutamide, and radium-223). 
There were no obvious diff
 erences either in time to any 
therapy or life-extending therapies between groups. There 
were however, diff
 erences in the pattern of therapy 
depending on whether patients were docetaxel-exposed 
upfront (fi
 gure 4). Analysis of zoledronic acid use after 
relapse is provided in the appendix page 7
. Overall 
exposure to treatment for progression is summarised in 
table 4, showing slightly higher rates of exposure to 
subsequent therapy in the control group. Use of 
cabazitaxel, enzalutamide, and radium-223 were low 
across all groups (appendix page 6).
The proportion of patients reporting worst adverse event 
ever as grade 3 or higher was highest with SOC + Doc 
(288 patients [52%]) and SOC + ZA + Doc (269 [52%]; 
table 5). This was mostly due to events during the fi
 rst 
6 months on trial, when the proportions were 17% (n=203) 
for SOC-only, 15% (n=91) for SOC + ZA, 36% (n=198) for 
SOC + Doc, and 39% (n=202) for SOC + ZA + Doc, with 
docetaxel seeming to contribute the most toxicity. For 
1998 patients with adverse event data around 1 year after 
randomisation (ie, worst adverse event grade reported at 
48 or 60 weeks of follow-up), the proportions of grade 3 or 
higher toxic eff
 ects were balanced, with 10% (n=76) patients 
reporting a worst adverse event as grade 3 or higher with 
SOC-only, 10% (n=41) with SOC + ZA, 10% with (n=43) 
SOC + Doc, and 12% (n=49) with SOC + ZA + Doc. The 
pattern and levels of adverse events were similar in the 
safety and intention-to-treat populations. There were ten

Discussion
The 
STAMPEDE 
randomised 
controlled 
trial 
is 
investigating the eff
 ectiveness of the front-line use of 
various treatments in men commencing long-term 
hormone therapy for newly diagnosed locally advanced 
or metastatic prostate cancer, or who have relapsed after 
local therapy with poor prognosis features. The MAMS 
design used in STAMPEDE has allowed us to address 
multiple treatment questions simultaneously within a 
single trial platform.18 We will report further randomised 
comparisons from STAMPEDE in the coming years 
(appendix page 2), meaning that, through this single 
protocol, we will have answered at least eight diff
 erent 
primary questions in 15 years. To have addressed as 
many questions in separate, sequential trials would have 
taken many decades and far more patients, notably 
allocated to control groups. We recommend that 
academic and industry researchers consider this design 
in the future, to make faster progress and good use of 
limited trial resources.
These are the fi
 rst mature, comparative, randomised 
data to emerge from the trial. We found that the addition 
of docetaxel to standard of care was associated with 
improved survival, with an HR of 0·78 and a diff
 erence 
in median survival of 10 months, as well as improvements 
in prostate-cancer-specifi
 c survival, failure-free survival, 
and skeletal-related events. The combination of 
zoledronic acid and docetaxel was associated with similar 
improvements, although the benefi
 t observed was 
smaller. We will report cost-eff
 ectiveness and patient-
reported outcomes separately.
Docetaxel is a widely used drug with a familiar toxicity 
profi
 le. Docetaxel was well tolerated in this population, 
with most patients completing all six cycles in a 
timely fashion and good dose intensity. Predictable 
chemotherapy toxic eff
 ects, including neutropenia and 
febrile neutropenia, were observed but few patients 
stopped treatment because of side-eff
 ects. Toxic eff
 ects in 
both docetaxel-containing groups seemed higher than in 
previous studies of this drug in patients with castrate-

no recommendations about growth factor support, and 
we have not collected information about its use.29,30
Docetaxel signifi
 cantly prolonged failure-free and 
overall survival across the trial population with no 
evidence that the eff
 ect varied across diff
 erent groups in 
the population; in particular, there is no evidence of a 
diff
 erence of the eff
 ect of docetaxel by metastatic status, 
for either of these outcome measures. The benefi
 cial 
eff
 ect on survival is clear in the larger metastatic 
subpopulation, which accounted for 61% of patients in 
the trial and 84% of deaths. There were fewer patients 
with non-metastatic disease and, with their generally 
more favourable prognosis, there were relatively few 
deaths in this group; all survival analyses for this subset 
are currently underpowered. In this non-metastatic 
subset of men, death from causes other than prostate 
cancer was more common than in men with metastatic 
disease, and therefore any eff
 ect of docetaxel on overall 
survival will be diluted. We will report longer-term 
follow-up in due course, but note that estimates of the 
treatment 
eff
 ect 
in 
failure-free 
survival 
and 
prostate-cancer-specifi
 c survival are extremely similar for 
patients with and without metastases at presentation.
For zoledronic acid, the results show no evidence of 
effi
  cacy on failure-free survival, skeletal-related events, 
or overall survival, despite good compliance with 
therapy and good levels of exposure, with target duration 
of 2 years. Few patients stopped treatment for side-
eff
 ects; the most frequent reason for stopping trial 
therapy within 2 years was disease progression. This 
diff
 ered between the SOC + ZA and SOC + ZA + Doc 
groups because failure-free survival was increased in 
the latter group by docetaxel, indirectly leading to 
increased exposure to zoledronic acid as well. Despite 
this increased exposure, zoledronic acid showed no

evidence of an advantage when added to docetaxel 
(HR 1·06).
The eff
 ect of docetaxel on survival was positive, but 
clinically signifi
 cant toxicity did occur; in clinical practice, 
consideration could be given to early use of growth factor 
support to enable treatment delivery. There was one 
treatment-related death in the SOC + Doc group and 
seven in the combination group. This diff
 erence, 
combined with a more modest survival benefi
 t for the 
combination treatment, raises the possibility of some 
interaction (or antagonism) between docetaxel and 
zoledronic acid in the treatment of this group of men.
A number of trials have now examined docetaxel in the 
hormone-naive context in both the non-metastatic and 
metastatic settings, of which STAMPEDE is the 
largest.25,26,31–34 These fi
 ndings are discussed elsewhere but 
consistently show an improvement in failure-free 
survival.14 The CHAARTED trial25 recently reported 
improved survival in metastatic disease whereas 
GETUG-15,26 a similar trial, did not report a diff
 erential 
eff
 ect. Taken with our results, there is compelling evidence 
that front-line docetaxel substantially improves survival in 
patients with metastatic disease. In the non-metastatic 
setting, there are insuffi
  cient mature survival results in 
the literature, so further follow-up and engagement in 
planned meta-analyses are needed to further delineate the 
eff
 ect of docetaxel on survival in this setting. The impact 
on failure-free survival is both clear and large in favour of 
docetaxel in STAMPEDE.
The case mix of patients joining the trial included men 
with newly diagnosed disease and a small proportion of 
patients with recurrent disease. The recurrent disease 
subset is small and thus it is unrealistic to look for 
statistically reliable results in such men; however, we 
note that estimates of the eff
 ect of docetaxel are consistent 
with that seen in the population as a whole.
For zoledronic acid, there are now several trials showing 
no evidence of a survival gain with upfront use,14,35–37 as 
discussed in the accompanying meta-analysis. This 
contrasts with the results from MRC PR0515 with sodium 
clodronate (another bisphosphonate), in which a survival 
benefi
 t was reported in a metastatic population. The

companion non-metastatic trial showed no evidence of an 
eff
 ect on survival with the same agent.15
Men in the STAMPEDE trial did better than we had 
expected in terms of survival. We believe this resulted 
from second-line and third-line treatments which were 
unavailable when the trial was designed. The timing of 
second-line therapy after relapse was similar across 
groups, but choice of which treatment to use was at the 
investigator’s discretion, and, consequently, was varied. 
This choice would have been aff
 ected by local practice 
and availability of newer treatments over time, such as 
abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223, and cabazitaxel, 
as well as allocated treatment in the trial.
There are several strengths to note in the STAMPEDE 
trial and specifi
 cally for the analyses reported here. First, 
the data were prospectively collected and randomised, 
from nearly 3000 men with patient characteristics that 
were well balanced by group, and we achieved good 
median follow-up (43 months). Second, the data were 
very recently frozen (May, 2015) at a pre-planned analysis 
point of roughly 400 control group deaths, meaning the 
primary outcome results are both well powered and have 
been reported promptly. Third, the patients contributing 
to these analyses came from more than 100 sites across 
the UK and Switzerland, suggesting the results 
to be generalisable. Fourth, the design allows easy 
understanding of eff
 ect across multiple randomisations. 
Finally, treatment compliance among patients starting 
treatment was good.
We are aware that there are also limitations within the 
data. First, the proportion of patients not starting 
treatment, especially docetaxel, will have a small diluting 
eff
 ect. Linkage to hospital records is required to report 
more detailed information on skeletal-related events. The 
impact of therapies that do not target androgen receptors 
on recurrence (as assessed by prostate-specifi
 c antigen) 
is likely to be complex. Finally, power for assessing the 
consistency of eff
 ects across subsets is inevitably low; we 
will report long-term follow-up in due course when the 
maturity will be much greater both across the trial and 
particularly in the non-metastatic subset.
In conclusion, we have shown improved survival across 
a population of men commencing fi
 rst-line long-term 
hormone therapy through the addition of docetaxel 
chemotherapy but not by adding zoledronic acid. 
Therefore, zoledronic acid should not become part of 
standard of care. Standard of care should be updated to 
include docetaxel chemotherapy in suitable patients with 
metastatic disease, and docetaxel may be considered for 
men with high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer with 
or without radiotherapy.
