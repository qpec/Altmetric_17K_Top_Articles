Abstract
Background: The lifesaving chemotherapy and radiation treatments that allow patients to survive cancer can also
result in a lifetime of side-effects, including male infertility. Infertility in male cancer survivors is thought to primarily
result from killing of the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) responsible for producing spermatozoa since SSCs turn
over slowly and are thereby sensitive to antineoplastic therapies. We previously demonstrated that the cytokine
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can preserve spermatogenesis after alkylating chemotherapy
(busulfan).
Methods: Male mice were treated with G-CSF or controls before and/or after sterilizing busulfan treatment and
evaluated immediately or 10–19 weeks later for effects on spermatogenesis.
Results: We demonstrated that the protective effect of G-CSF on spermatogenesis was stable for at least 19 weeks
after chemotherapy, nearly twice as long as previously shown. Further, G-CSF treatment enhanced spermatogenic
measures 10 weeks after treatment in the absence of a cytotoxic insult, suggesting G-CSF acts as a mitogen in
steady-state spermatogenesis. In agreement with this conclusion, G-CSF treatment for 3 days before busulfan
treatment exacerbated the loss of spermatogenesis observed with G-CSF alone. Reciprocally, spermatogenic
recovery was modestly enhanced in mice treated with G-CSF for 4 days after busulfan. These results suggested that
G-CSF promoted spermatogonial proliferation, leading to enhanced spermatogenic regeneration from surviving
SSCs. Similarly, there was a significant increase in proportion of PLZF+ undifferentiated spermatogonia that were
Ki67+ (proliferating) 1 day after G-CSF treatment.
Conclusions: Together, these results clarify that G-CSF protects spermatogenesis after alkylating chemotherapy by
stimulating proliferation of surviving spermatogonia, and indicate it may be useful as a retrospective fertility-
restoring treatment.

 Summary
The cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor pro-
motes
spermatogenic
regeneration
from
surviving
spermatogonia after high-dose alkylating chemotherapy
in a manner that involves enhanced proliferation of un-
differentiated spermatogonia.
Background
Currently, survival rates for childhood cancer (ages 0–14
years, all sites and races) in the US and abroad exceed
84% due to advent of more effective, life-saving cancer
treatments (84.5% in US, 86% in Austria, [1, 2]). As a re-
sult of these successful oncological therapies, many sur-
vivors of childhood cancers are able to lead long,
productive lives. However, these cancer survivors are
often plagued by the life-long side-effects induced by the
same treatments that saved their lives [3–5]. Among the
most devastating of these so-called late effects (long-
term side-effects) of chemotherapy and radiation treat-
ments for cancer is male infertility [6–9]. While men
and boys who have undergone puberty can ensure their
future fertility by cryobanking sperm obtained from an
ejaculate [10], this is not an option for pre-pubertal boys
who are not yet making mature gametes.
As a result of this clinical need for fertility preserva-
tion strategies in pre-pubertal cancer patients, a number
of experimental approaches have been under intense de-
velopment [10–16], and specifically, to preserve fertility
of pre-pubertal boys. Inherent to these strategies, how-
ever, are risks associated with invasive surgical testicular
tissue retrieval, including anesthesia, infection and delays
to primary disease therapy, which remain major con-
cerns that drive the risk-benefit ratio in favor of no
intervention and likelihood of permanent infertility. As
an alternative, we previously identified a completely
non-invasive approach to preserving male fertility after
cancer treatment, using injections of the cytokine gran-
ulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which would
obviate the need for the invasive techniques currently
under development. Specifically, we recently found that
G-CSF treatments in mice led to significantly better re-
covery of spermatogenesis after busulfan treatment than
in untreated controls [17]. Serendipitously, it also ap-
pears treatment with G-CSF treatment as part of a bone
marrow mobilization strategy in rhesus macaques was
associated with enhanced spermatogenic recovery fol-
lowing busulfan chemotherapy [12, 18]. Therefore, G-
CSF treatment to protect spermatogenesis from cancer
treatments has the potential to revolutionize male
fertility preservation in a manner that can be rapidly
translated to the clinic because various forms of G-CSF
are already FDA-approved (e.g., filgrastim: Neupogen® -
Amgen, Granix® - Teva, Zarxio® - Novartis).
However, before G-CSF treatment can be translated to
the clinic as a fertility preservation/restoration agent,
more thorough examination of efficacy and mechanism
of action must be undertaken. Indeed, a number of
questions arose as a result of our initial study, including:
1) whether G-CSF-induced spermatogenic protection
against busulfan sterilization was stable longer than the
10 weeks previously examined, 2) whether G-CSF treat-
ment influences steady-state spermatogenesis, 3) the
precise temporal window during with which G-CSF pro-
motes spermatogenic recovery after busulfan treat-
ment, and 4) whether G-CSF promotes proliferation of
undifferentiated spermatogonia, in vivo. This present
study addresses these open questions and provides
additional evidence supporting the concept that treat-
ment with G-CSF protects spermatogenesis from alkyl-
ating
chemotherapies
by
driving
proliferation
of
surviving undifferentiated spermatogonia. As a result,
it now appears that G-CSF treatment would be most
useful as a fertility-restoring adjuvant therapy to pro-
mote enhanced spermatogenic recovery and future fer-
tility after sterilizing cancer treatments.
Methods
Animals
Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory and maintained with ad libitum normal la-
boratory diet. All experiments utilizing animals were ap-
proved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of Texas at San Antonio
(Assurance A3592-01) and were performed in accord-
ance with the National Research Council Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Experimental design, G-CSF and busulfan treatments
Five week old male mice were given subcutaneous
injections of recombinant human granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor (PeproTech) suspended in Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Life Technologies)
containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V (BSA,
MP Biomedicals) or 0.5% BSA in DPBS alone (vehicle),
as described previously [17]. G-CSF dosages were ei-
ther 50ug/kg/day or 125ug/kg twice daily (see Fig. 1).
On the third day, mice were also given either busul-
fan [44 mg/kg, in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); Sigma-
Aldrich] or DMSO alone by a single IP injection, also
as described previously [17]. In experiment 2 (a and b),
three schedules of G-CSF administration were used relative
to busulfan or DMSO treatment on day 3 (as described
above): days 1–3 (before), days 4–7 (after), or days 1–7
(throughout). Animals were euthanized at 19 weeks
(experiment 1) or 10 weeks (experiments 2 and 3 –
see Fig. 1) and evaluated for spermatogenic metrics
(testes

 histololgy). In experiment 3, animals were euthanized
24 h after the last G-CSF/vehicle injection (immuno-
fluorescent co-labeling of undifferentiated spermato-
gonia and Ki67; Fig. 1) as described [17].
Testis weights and blinded histological analyses
Testes from each animal were weighed and fixed with
fresh 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded and sec-
tioned (5 μm) and cross-sections were H&E stained.
Composite tiled mosaic images of eight testis sections
(≥35 μm offset between each section) were obtained at
20X magnification using an AxioImager M1 (Zeiss) and
an AxioCam ICc1 (Zeiss). Round seminiferous tubule
cross-sections in each image were categorized according
to the degree of spermatogenesis as described previously
[17] based on the most advanced germ cells present in
each tubule cross section. Specifically, we counted and
categorized tubules based on whether they contained
complete spermatogenesis (containing all germ cell types
up to and including elongating spermatids or spermato-
zoa), round spermatids (all germ cell types up to and in-
cluding post-meiotic round spermatids, but not more
advanced elongating spermatids or spermatozoa), pri-
mary spermatocytes (all germ cell types up to and
including primary spermatocytes, but not more ad-
vanced germ cell types), or were empty (marked absence
of germ cells, Sertoli cell-only and/or some spermato-
gonia). Data are reported as percentages of seminiferous
tubules containing the noted categories of the most
advanced germ cell types. All histological sections/im-
ages were blinded for imaging and analysis. Statistically
significant differences between groups were determined
by Student’s t-tests.
Seminiferous tubule diameters were calculated auto-
matically using a digital image processing algorithm
developed in MATLAB 2015b (The MathWorks, Inc)
revised from a previous iteration [17] to improve
characterization
of
challenging
histological
sections.
Only
data
from
round
seminiferous
tubule
cross-
sections [shape factor (4πarea/circumference2) values of
≥0.8] were used for subsequent analyses, an approach
used previously to define roundness of isolated cells
[19–21]. Tubule equivalent diameter (√(4area/π)) was
calculated as the diameter of a circle with the equivalent
area of each tubule cross-section.
Sperm counts
One epididymis from each animal was used to quantify
sperm counts using a swim-up technique. Briefly, each
complete epididymis was minced in room temperature
DBPS, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow motile
sperm to swim out of the ducts and sperm number per ml
was determined by hemocytometer after PFA fixation.
Immunofluorescent tissue staining
In experiment 3, testes sections were stained with anti-
bodies
against
γH2A.X
to
identify
spermatocytes
(marker of DNA double-strand breaks) and with lectin
peanut agglutinin (PNA) to label terminal β-galactose
found on spermatid acrosomes. In experiment 4, testis
sections from treated mice generated previously [17]
were
stained
with
antibodies
against
promyelocitic
leukemia zinc-finger protein (PLZF, marker of undiffer-
entiated spermatogonia) and Ki67 (marker of cellular
proliferation), essentially as described [17, 22]. Briefly,

and spermatogenic recovery after busulfan treatment. In all experiments, 5-week old C57BL/6 males were treated with G-CSF or vehicle over the
course of a 7 day period (green or open triangles, respectively) and given one injection of DMSO or Busulfan on day 3. The four experiments
differed in the G-CSF dose, G-CSF administration duration and schedule relative to busulfan treatment, as well as the time to analysis1. Animals in
Experiments 1–3 were euthanized after 10–19 weeks and effects on spermatogenesis were assessed by comparing testis weights, testis histology
and cauda epididymal sperm counts (except for experiment 1). Note: mouse sperm image from MethBank: a Database of DNA Methylome Programming

(2.5 μg/ml, mouse anti-human Ki67 IgG1k, Clone B56,

ating spermatids. Positive immunoreactivity was vali-
dated by omission of primary antibody. Fluorescently
stained sections were mounted with FluoromountG
(Southern BioTech). Composite tiled mosaic images
for each complete section at 20X magnification were
generated using an AxioImager M1 (Zeiss) and an
AxioCam
MRm
(Zeiss).
The
frequency
of
PLZF+
spermatogonia in round seminiferous tubule cross-
sections exhibiting positive staining for Ki67 in each
image was determined using NIH Image J using the
Cell Counter plugin. Ki67/PLZF staining was quanti-
fied in similar numbers of round seminiferous tubule
cross-sections from
4 animals
per group (average
number of tubules = Control 519 ± 127; Busulfan 479
± 11; Busulfan + G-CSF 448 ± 18; not significantly dif-
ferent between groups).
Results
In our first experiment (Experiment 1, Fig. 1), male mice
were separated into three groups, vehicle-treated “Con-
trol”, “Busulfan Only” (44 mg/kg), and “Busulfan + G-
CSF” animals which received G-CSF (50ug/kg/day) in
addition to busulfan and all were allowed to recover
until 19 weeks transpired (Fig. 1). As shown previously
at 10 weeks [17], busulfan treatment caused a significant
decline in testis weights at 19 weeks compared with con-
trol animals, but testis weights did not differ significantly
between
the
Busulfan
Only
and
Busulfan + G-CSF
groups (Fig. 2a). Histological examination of the testes
confirmed that many seminiferous tubule cross-sections
were devoid of germ cells in animals treated with busul-
fan (Busulfan Only and Busulfan + G-CSF groups; Fig. 2b
and Additional file 1: Table S1), as compared with Con-
trol animals, in which nearly all tubule cross-sections in
contained complete spermatogenesis (Fig. 2b and Add-
itional file 1: Table S1). However, like we previously ob-
served at 10 weeks [17], treatment with G-CSF led to
significantly better spermatogenic recovery at 19 weeks
than in Busulfan only group (p ≤ 0.0285; Fig. 2b and
Additional file 1: Table S1). Specifically, there were 2.8-
fold more tubule cross-sections containing complete
spermatogenesis in animals treated with G-CSF com-
pared with busulfan only (Fig. 2). These results confirm
that G-CSF-induced spermatogenic protection is stable
for at least twice the duration initially examined and
likely originates from an effect at the level of SSCs.
To determine if G-CSF treatment had an effect on
steady state spermatogenesis, in Experiment 2 (Fig. 1),
we compared control animals that received vehicle

of two G-CSF doses (50ug/kg/day – Exp 2a or 125ug/kg
twice daily – Exp 2b) for 3 days, 4 days or 7 days
(Fig. 1). The higher G-CSF dose (125ug/kg, twice daily;
250ug/kg/day) was chosen based on the effective dose
required for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization in
mice [25–27]. Animals received escalating schedules of
3, 4 or 7 days of G-CSF (or control) injections in order
to match the treatment course in Experiment 3 (in which
animals received either Busulfan or Busulfan + G-CSF treat-
ment). Testis weights were unchanged in animals treated
with 50ug/kg/day G-CSF compared with controls (Fig. 3a).
Modest increases in testis weight that were suggestive of
statistical significance were observed with either 3 days or
4 days of high-dose G-CSF treatment (*p ≤0.057 and

statistically significant difference between groups (‡p ≤0.002) as determined by t-test. The number of seminiferous tubule cross-sections evaluated per

 cauda epididymal sperm counts were also significantly
higher in animals receiving 3 days of G-CSF treatment
(50ug/kg/day or 250ug/kg/day) or 7 days of high-dose G-
CSF treatment (***p ≤0.03 and †p ≤0.006, respectively;
Fig. 3b). As expected, G-CSF treatment with 50ug/kg/day
did not significantly alter the proportion of seminiferous
tubules that contained complete spermatogenesis (Fig. 3c).
Only testes of animals treated for 7 days with the high G-
CSF dose exhibited a significantly increased proportion of
seminiferous tubules containing complete spermatogenesis
(‡p ≤0.002; Fig. 3c), although the absolute difference was
marginal (99.05% vs. 99.85% complete spermatogenesis, re-
spectively). Diameters of round seminiferous tubules from
mice that received 50ug/kg/day G-CSF for 3 days were sig-
nificantly smaller than controls (148 ± 3 μm vs.168 ± 3 μm,
respectively; Additional file 2: Figure S1A), while all other
groups were not significantly different (Additional file 2:
Figure S1A), indicating equivalent extent of spermatogen-
esis among seminiferous tubules. Together, these data sug-
gest that G-CSF may modestly enhance steady-state
spermatogenesis in the absence of a cytotoxic insult.
We performed a third experiment in order to deter-
mine when G-CSF promotes spermatogenic recovery
relative to busulfan treatment, before and/or after the
cytotoxic insult (Fig. 1). In Experiment 3, busulfan only
animals were compared to busulfan + G-CSF animals
which received high-dose G-CSF (125ug/kg, twice daily)
on three different schedules: for 3 days ending on the
day of busulfan treatment (Before), for four days starting
on the day after busulfan treatment (After), and for all
seven days (Throughout; Fig. 1) and again evaluated at
10 weeks. Testis weights of animals receiving G-CSF be-
fore busulfan were significantly reduced compared with
busulfan only controls (*p ≤0.006; Fig. 4a), and while
those which received G-CSF after busulfan or through-
out the week were higher than controls, the differences
were
not
statistically
significant.
Cauda
epididymal
sperm counts from animals receiving G-CSF either be-
fore or after busulfan were not significantly different
from busulfan only controls, but sperm counts for ani-
mals treated with G-CSF for the entire week were sig-
nificantly higher (**p ≤0.002; Fig. 4b), in agreement with
previous results [17].
We observed seminiferous tubules in animals treated
with Busulfan alone and animals that also received
G-CSF
treatment
that
contained
apparently
normal
spermatogenesis that was similar to control animals that
did not receive any busulfan or G-CSF (Fig. 4c-k). These
seminiferous tubules with complete spermatogenesis ap-
peared histologically normal (Fig. 4c-e), but were signifi-
cantly smaller in diameter than those from control testes
(Additional file 2: Figure S1B). There were no differences
in diameters of spermatogenesis-containing seminiferous
tubules between busulfan-treated animal groups with or
without G-CSF treatment (Additional file 2: Figure S1B).
As expected, tubules with complete spermatogenesis also
exhibited punctate staining for gamma-H2A.X in pachy-
tene spermatocytes (Fig. 4f-h) and intense diffuse nuclear
gamma-H2A.X staining in preleptotene-through early zyg-
otene spermatocytes (Fig. 4i-k; [28]), and intense lectin
peanut agglutinin staining on acrosomes of round and
elongating spermatids (Fig. 4f-k; [29, 30]). Testes of ani-
mals treated with G-CSF before busulfan tended to have
fewer seminiferous tubules with complete spermatogen-
esis (Fig. 4l), in line with testis weights. However, G-CSF
administration after busulfan treatment led to an increase
in the proportion of seminiferous tubules with complete
spermatogenesis at a level that was suggestive of signifi-
cance (***p ≤0.086; Fig. 4e, f, i). G-CSF administration
throughout the week exhibited a trend towards increased
complete spermatogenesis (Fig. 4c, d, i) in agreement with
previous results [17]. The lack of statistical significance at
the level of p <0.05 was at least partly due to the pro-
nounced variability in efficiency of busulfan-induced sper-
matogenic loss (compare three busulfan alone groups,
Fig. 4l). Examination of the results from each individual
animal, however, demonstrated that only one of ten ani-
mals that received Busulfan alone recovered complete
spermatogenesis in at least 50% of seminiferous tubule
cross-sections (10%), while 2/4 animals in the “after” Bu-
sulfan + G-CSF group recovered spermatogenesis to this
extent and both animals in this group exhibited >55%
seminiferous tubules containing complete spermatogen-
esis (Fig. 4m). Reciprocally, none of the animals in “be-
fore” Busulfan + G-CSF group recovered spermatogenesis
exceeding to 50% or greater (0%; Fig. 4m). Thus, while it
is important to note that we observed significant variabil-
ity in the effect of busulfan, these results demonstrate that
G-CSF exacerbated spermatogenic loss when given before
busulfan treatment and enhanced spermatogenic recovery
from surviving spermatogonia after busulfan treatment.
To address the possibility that G-CSF promotes sper-
matogenic regeneration by stimulating proliferation of
surviving undifferentiating spermatogonia after busulfan
treatment, we examined Ki67 labeling of PLZF+ undiffer-
entiated spermatogonia in testes of mice analyzed 24 h
after the last G-CSF or vehicle treatment (tissues were
from animals reported previously [17]). The Ki67 protein
is an established marker of cellular proliferation because
its expression is observed only during G1, S, G2 and M
phases of the cell cycle and not during G0 phase [31].
PLZF [32, 33] is a transcription factor expressed by undif-
ferentiated spermatogonia in rodents (Asingle, Apaired and
Aaligned4–16 spermatogonia [34]). As expected, busulfan-
treated mice that also received G-CSF had significantly
higher proportion of PLZF+ undifferentiated spermato-
gonia that were co-labeled for Ki67 (proliferating) than
busulfan only animals (p ≤0.035; Figure 5a-d). Thus, the

Discussion
Preserving and restoring male fertility after chemother-
apy and radiation treatments for cancer and other non-
malignant disorders has received significant scientific at-
tention for more than a decade, and in particular, fertil-
ity preservation among pre-pubertal boys who are not
yet making sperm has been a major research focus
around the world [6, 7, 10, 11, 16, 35–37]. We previ-
ously described an alternative adjuvant strategy using in-
jections of the cytokine G-CSF at around the time of
chemotherapy/radiation treatment to enhance spermato-
genic recovery and potentially preserve fertility [17].
Here, we provide additional evidence of the stability of
the protective effect of G-CSF on spermatogenesis after
chemotherapy and suggest that the mode of G-CSF ac-
tion is by promotion of spermatogonial proliferation,
leading to enhanced spermatogenic regeneration from
surviving SSCs.
Notably, though, the efficacy of busulfan sterilization
(revealed by the proportion of tubule cross-sections with
spermatogenesis) was variable both between studies and
within the current study. For instance, we previously
reported that ~9.5% of tubule cross-sections contained
any degree of spermatogenesis [17], yet we observed only
2.5% of tubules contained spermatogenesis in experiment
1 (see Fig. 2). Likewise, in experiment 3, the proportion of
seminiferous tubules containing spermatogenesis in busul-
fan only animals ranged from 0% (after group) to 26.6%
(before group), with an average of 18.7% ± 7.7%, demon-
strating considerable intra-experiment variation. While it
is not possible to directly compare the results from differ-
ent experimental groups because each received different
treatment regimens, future studies might explore methods
to improve reliability of busulfan sterilization, alternative
agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide), or use of irradiation.
Highly variable busulfan pharmacokinetics in human pa-
tients, even intra-individually, is well known [38–41].
Therefore, although we took great care to ensure accurate
busulfan dosing and employed an inbred mouse strain to
reduce the influence of genetic modifiers on the experi-
mental outcomes, differences in busulfan pharmacokinet-
ics between individual animals could have led to the
variability in busulfan efficacy we observed. These results
also highlight that the danger of assuming consistent effi-
cacy of busulfan sterilization. Despite variability of the pri-
mary

agent

appeared to enhance spermatogenic recovery thereafter.
Since the receptor for G-CSF, colony-stimulating fac-
tor 3 receptor (CSF3R), has been previously detected on
the cell surface of cultured THY-1 Cell Surface Antigen

 possible that G-CSF may act directly on undifferentiated
spermatogonia and have a role in promoting normal
steady state spermatogenesis. Results from experiment 2
demonstrated modest enhancement in all spermatogenic
parameters examined in animals exposed only to G-CSF
(testis size, caudal sperm counts, proportion of semin-
iferous tubules containing complete spermatogenesis),
suggesting that G-CSF may drive maximal spermato-
genic output. It is not surprising that the absolute extent
of spermatogenesis was only modestly influenced by
administering exogenous G-CSF because the spermato-
genic ceiling is established by Sertoli cell number, which
dictates the number of available niches for spermatogon-
ial stem cells (SSCs) and extent of trophic support for
differentiating spermatogenic cells [42–49]. Postnatal
mouse Sertoli cells proliferate only until about 15–20
days postpartum [50, 51], and since Sertoli cell number
establishes the spermatogenic ceiling, the extent of
spermatogenesis could not be enhanced substantially by
G-CSF in the five week old mice used in this study.
G-CSF binding to its receptor promotes cellular prolif-
eration in a variety of tissues, both in vivo and in vitro
[52–56]. Therefore, if G-CSF promotes proliferation of
undifferentiated spermatogonia expressing the CSF3R
protein, the susceptibility of the germline to a cytotoxic
insult, such as the alkylating agent busulfan, should dif-
fer based on proliferative drive by G-CSF. In the present
study, we observed elevated spermatogenic susceptibility
to busulfan (e.g., smaller testes and fewer tubules with
spermatogenesis) when G-CSF was given before busul-
fan, consistent with increased spermatogonial prolifera-
tion before cytotoxic insult. Likewise, mice had larger
testes with more spermatogenesis when G-CSF was
given only after busulfan, also consistent with increased
spermatogonial proliferation leading to enhanced regen-
eration from surviving spermatogonia. Animals receiving
G-CSF both before and after busulfan exhibited an inter-
mediate, but positive effect on spermatogenesis consist-
ent with previous studies [17]. Results of a previous
study in which a moderate dose of G-CSF (100ug/kg/
day) was administered for 3 days prior to sub-sterilizing
(5Gy) gamma irradiation and in which a seemingly pro-
tective effect of G-CSF on repopulation of seminiferous
tubules was reported [57] appeared to conflict with re-
sults of the present study. But, this apparent discrepancy
could arise from any of a number of differences in the
experimental design and treatment schedule, including
use of a sub-sterilizing radiation dose (vs. high-dose bu-
sulfan), different metrics used in establishing repopula-
tion (≥3 differentiating Type-B spermatogonia in a
tubule cross-section) or the short (3 week) time to ana-
lysis (vs ≥10 weeks). Future studies to more extensively
evaluate the time-course of G-CSF-induced spermato-
genic regeneration and test its efficacy in the context of
other cytotoxic agents would help to resolve these
discrepancies.
While it would not have been informative to examine
spermatogonial proliferation directly in the animals from
experiment 3, since the effects of G-CSF would have
been realized only at the time of treatment, we did re-
visit
the
proliferative
index
among
undifferentiated
spermatogonia from mice treated with G-CSF and ana-
lyzed acutely thereafter [17]. A small, but statistically
significant increase in Ki67+ labeling index of PLZF+
spermatogonia
in
animals
treated
with
G-CSF
in
addition to busulfan is consistent with the potential role
of G-CSF in promoting proliferation of undifferentiated
spermatogonia and results of previous experiments dem-
onstrating an increase in PLZF+ spermatogonial num-
bers with no change in apoptosis [17]. Ki67 is a protein
antigen that is specifically expressed during G1, S, G2,
M cell cycle phases of proliferating cells and essentially
absent in cells that are arrested in the G0 phase [31],
and thus, is recognized as an excellent marker of cell
proliferation. However, even well-controlled antibody
staining experiments can lead to spurious results. Thus,
future studies in support of the Ki67+ labeling index re-
ported here could examine S-phase labeling index by in-
corporation of thymidine analogs (e.g., BrdU, EdU, etc.),
both in vivo and in vitro.
Like previous studies in both males and females
[17, 57, 58], G-CSF improved the extent of gameto-
genesis after busulfan chemotherapy in our present
studies. However, despite temporal optimization and
increased G-CSF doses, spermatogenic recovery after
busulfan treatment was still incomplete in our studies.
This consistent result begs the question whether the
extent of spermatogenic regeneration induced by G-
CSF after a cytotoxic insult will be sufficient to pro-
mote recovery of fertility. Such an outcome would
make G-CSF treatment an effective clinical adjuvant
therapy for promoting male fertility restoration after
sterilizing therapies. Future studies will be needed to
determine if G-CSF effectively restores male fertility
after sterilizing chemotherapy insults. With a bur-
geoning
population
of
cancer
survivors,
some
of
whom will have received G-CSF for chronic neutro-
penia after treatment for their primary disease, it may
be possible to interrogate whether G-CSF promotes
fertility restoration in human patients. Therefore, it is
possible that patients who receive adjuvant G-CSF to
address a common hematopoietic side-effect of cancer
therapy, both as children or in adulthood, may be less
likely to remain infertile after a sterilizing therapy
than patients who receive only chemotherapy/radi-
ation for their primary disease. It is important to
note, though, that the studies examining G-CSF as a
protective agent performed to date have utilized adult

Page 9 of 12
 animals, and thus, the applicability to prepubertal
cancer patients will first need to be established by
examining the influence of G-CSF on spermatogenic
recovery in immature animals. Thus, it would be pre-
mature to apply G-CSF clinically as a means of pro-
tecting or restoring fertility in humans until such
studies have been completed. Ultimately, though, G-
CSF may serve as another instrument to address male
infertility as one of the most common side-effects of
lifesaving treatments for cancer.
Conclusions
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) appears
to promote proliferation of undifferentiated spermato-
gonia, which leads to a modest enhancement of sper-
matogenic regeneration from surviving spermatogonia
after high-dose alkylating chemotherapy. G-CSF treat-
ment alone also enhances spermatogenic parameters,
suggesting a role in steady-state spermatogenesis.
