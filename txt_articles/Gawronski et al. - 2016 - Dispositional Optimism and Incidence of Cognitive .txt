Abstract
Objective—Higher levels of optimism have been linked with positive health behaviors, 
biological processes, and health conditions that are potentially protective against cognitive 
impairment in older adults. However, the association between optimism and cognitive impairment 
has not been directly examined. We examined whether optimism is associated with incident 
cognitive impairment in older adults.
Methods—Data are from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative sample of 
older U.S. adults. Using multiple logistic regression models, we prospectively assessed whether 
optimism was associated with incident cognitive impairment in 4,624 adults aged 65+ over a four-
year period.
Results—Among the 4,624 participants, 497 respondents developed cognitive impairment over 
the four-year follow-up (306 women and 191 men). Higher optimism was associated with 
decreased risk of incident cognitive impairment. When controlling for sociodemographic factors, 
each standard deviation increase in optimism was associated with reduced odds (OR=0.72, 95% 
CI, 0.62–0.83) of becoming cognitively impaired. A dose-response relationship was observed.

 Compared to those with the lowest levels of optimism, people with moderate levels of optimism 
had somewhat reduced odds of cognitive impairment (OR=0.79, 95% CI, 0.59–1.03), while people 
with the highest levels of optimism had the lowest odds of cognitive impairment (OR=0.53, 95% 
CI, 0.35–0.78). These associations remained after adjusting for health behaviors, biological 
factors, and psychological covariates that could either confound the association of interest or serve 
on the pathway.
Conclusions—Optimism was prospectively associated with a reduced likelihood of becoming 
cognitively impaired. If these results are replicated, the data suggest that potentially modifiable 
aspects of positive psychological functioning such as optimism play an important role in 
maintaining cognitive functioning. Thus, these factors may prove worthy of additional clinical and 
scientific attention.

Given the rapidly increasing population of older adults in the United States, cognitive 
impairment is a growing concern (1). Cognitive impairment encompasses several conditions, 
with symptoms ranging from mild (e.g., mild cognitive impairment) to severe (e.g., 
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias) (2). Age is the primary risk factor for cognitive 
impairment, and the population of adults over the age of 65 is estimated to double by 2050 
(2,3). Further, costs of health care, long-term care, and hospice for cognitively impaired 
people is predicted to rise from $214 billion today to $1.2 trillion by 2050 (1). Therefore, 
there is an increasingly urgent need to identify potentially modifiable risk factors, which 
may in turn open new avenues for innovative interventions.
Although many studies have investigated behavioral and biological risk factors for cognitive 
impairment, fewer studies have examined psychological factors—even though research 
shows that psychological factors such as depression or a sense of purpose in life impact a 
person’s risk for a variety of health conditions (4,5). Past studies that examined 
psychological factors in relation to cognitive impairment mainly considered potential risk 
imposed by depression and anxiety (6,7). It is possible that some psychological factors may 
protect cognitive function, but far less is known about these factors and their possible effects. 
Aspects of positive psychological functioning such as optimism have been linked with a 
variety of positive health behaviors (e.g., less cigarette smoking, more exercise) and 
biological processes (e.g., reduced levels of inflammatory agents), and reduced likelihood of 
health conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease and stroke) that are associated with risk of 
cognitive impairment, and therefore may warrant further investigation (4,8–14). Further, 
while optimism is about 25% heritable, several studies suggest that it may be learned (e.g., 
through classroom style instruction and activities, or brief paper and pencil exercises) and 
shaped by social influences (e.g., optimism is patterned by factors like education and 
income) (15–18). Therefore, optimism may provide a point of intervention for enhancing 
health prior to the development of health problems (19).
No studies to our knowledge have directly examined optimism’s association with risk of 
becoming cognitively impaired. To address this knowledge gap, we examined this

 association using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a prospective and 
nationally representative study of U.S. adults over the age of 50. We hypothesized that 
optimism would be associated with reduced likelihood of becoming cognitively impaired. 
We adjusted for potential confounder (e.g., sociodemographic) and pathway (e.g., behavior 
and biological) variables (8,11–13,20). Because prior research suggests women have higher 
lifetime risk of developing cognitive impairment than men, we tested a potential interaction 
between optimism and gender. Because they have been previously linked with cognitive 
impairment, we also adjusted for depression and anxiety symptoms to evaluate if the 
optimism-cognitive impairment association might be mainly driven by the absence of these 
forms of psychological distress (6,7).
Methods
Participants
The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a nationally representative panel study of 
Americans over the age of 50. Since the study began in 1992, it has tracked over 37,000 
Americans biannually. Starting in 2006, the HRS added a detailed module that gathered 
information about several psychological factors, including optimism. Because all relevant 
psychological and covariate data were collected in 2006, this data collection wave served as 
this study’s baseline. Incident cognitive impairment was assessed during the follow-up 
waves (2008 and 2010). Exit interviews were completed by knowledgeable informants for 
respondents who died during follow-up. This study used de-identified, publicly available 
data, therefore the Institutional Review Board at the University of Michigan exempted it 
from review. The University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research conducts the study 
and provides extensive documentation about the protocol, instrumentation, sampling 
strategy, and statistical weighting procedures (http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/).
Procedure
In the 2006 wave, approximately half of the HRS respondents (n=9,568) were randomly 
selected for an enhanced face-to-face interview. At the end of each interview, interviewers 
left behind a questionnaire that included psychological measures, which respondents 
completed and returned by mail. Among those interviewed, the response rate for the leave-
behind questionnaire was 90% (n=8,568). HRS sampling weights were used in all analyses 
to account for the complex multistage probability survey design, which includes individual 
non-response, sample clustering, stratification, and further post-stratification. While the 
HRS interviews all couples in a household regardless of age, the sampling weights apply 
only to people aged 51+, in order to ensure that the sample is nationally representative of 
adults aged 51+. The inclusion of these survey weights left us with 7,168 respondents who 
were initially eligible for this study. More detailed information about the survey weights 
used in this study can be found in an HRS documentation report (21).
We then excluded 2,424 participants younger than 65 because only an abbreviated version of 
the HRS cognitive test is administered to these younger respondents, and because cognitive 
impairment is rare in this age group. Of those affected by cognitive impairment in this age 
group, these people tend to have a higher burden of rare and inherited dementias than adults

 who develop cognitive impairment later in life, and therefore the causes of cognitive 
impairment in these two groups may not be comparable (22). We also excluded 120 
respondents who reported cognitive impairment at baseline (2006), resulting in a final 
sample of 4,624 respondents. To ensure that the exclusion of respondents < 65 years of age 
did not bias our results, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis that included cognitively 
normal, younger respondents in our analytic sample (n=6,999).
Measures
Cognitive Impairment Assessment—Cognitive functioning is assessed at each data 
collection wave in the HRS. Data from the 2008 and 2010 waves of the study were used to 
determine incidence of cognitive impairment. Among respondents 65 years of age and older, 
the HRS assesses cognitive functioning using a version of the modified Telephone Interview 
for Cognitive Status (TICS-M), which was derived from the Mini-Mental State Examination 
(23). The 35-point assessment included tests of memory, serial 7 subtractions, processing 
speed, naming, and orientation (24). This assessment tool has been shown to have high 
sensitivity and specificity for cognitive impairment in older adults (23,25). Approximately 
10% of respondents were unable to participate in direct cognitive assessments. For these 
participants, a validated 16-item Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in Elderly 
(IQCODE) was completed by proxies (26).
The cut points for both the self-report and proxy scales for cognitive functioning were 
derived from previous research conducted on cognitive impairment in the HRS and the 
Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study—an extensive substudy of dementia conducted 
within the HRS (27,28). For self-respondents using the 35-point cognitive functioning scale, 
a score of 11 to 35 was defined as “normal cognitive functioning,” while a score of 0 to10 
was defined as “cognitive impairment.” For proxy respondents, IQCODE scores greater than 
3 were defined as “cognitive impairment.” More detailed information about the self-report 
and proxy measures of cognitive impairment can be found in an HRS documentation report 
(24). In order to test the influence of potential practice effects, we also conducted all 
analyses using an increased cut-off score for cognitive impairment at follow-up (12 versus 
11, the baseline cut-off). We found that the estimates of association were virtually 
indistinguishable.
Optimism Measurement—The six-item Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) was used 
to assess optimism (29). The measure has good discriminant and convergent validity, and 
good reliability. Previous research has demonstrated that optimism assessed by the LOT-R is 
generally stable over time (8). In the HRS sample, correlation between optimism at baseline 
(2006) and at follow-up (2010) was 0.58. Respondents rated each item on a 6-point Likert 
scale, indicating the degree to which they endorsed items such as, “In uncertain times, I 
usually expect the best,” or “If something can go wrong for me, it will.” All three negatively 
worded items were reverse scored. All items were then averaged together, with higher scores 
indicating higher optimism (Cronbach’s α=0.79). Then, overall optimism scores were 
standardized (M=0, SD=1) to facilitate comparisons of effect size across optimism studies. 
In this study, odds ratios can be interpreted as the change in odds of becoming cognitively 
impaired as a function of a one standard deviation increase in optimism.

 Sometimes researchers split the LOT-R into two subscales—one consisting of only 
negatively valenced items and one consisting of only positively valenced items (30,31). 
However, optimism is most accurately captured by a scale that combines negatively valenced 
items that are rejected and positively valenced items that are endorsed (30). Therefore, 
building upon theory and research in this area, we used the six-item composite rather than 
creating two 3-item subscales (14,31).
Covariates Measurement—Potential confounders or pathways linking optimism with 
risk of cognitive impairment included sociodemographic, behavioral, biological, and 
psychological factors that prior work suggests are relevant to cognitive impairment risk (6–
8,11–13,20). All variables described below were collected via self-report at baseline in 2006. 
Building on relevant findings in the literature, we adjusted for a wide array of potential 
confounder (e.g., sociodemographic) and pathway (e.g., behavior and biological) variables. 
Given that prior research suggests women have higher lifetime risk of developing cognitive 
impairment than men, we tested a potential interaction between optimism and gender to 
assess possible gender differences in the association of interest (1). We also adjusted for 
depression and anxiety symptoms because they have been previously linked with cognitive 
impairment (6,7). Findings that the association between optimism and cognitive impairment 
is maintained even after adjusting for these factors would mitigate concerns that the 
association between optimism and cognitive impairment is mainly driven by the absence of 
these forms of psychological distress.
Potential confounders included: age, gender, race/ethnicity (Caucasian-American, African-
American, Hispanic, Other), marital status (married/not married), educational attainment (no 
degree, GED or high school diploma, college degree or higher), and total wealth (based on 
tertiles of the score distribution in this sample).
Psychological factors (e.g., depression, anxiety) that might confound the primary 
associations of interest were assessed at baseline with widely used measures that have good 
reliability and validity. Depression symptoms were measured as a continuous variable using 
a short form version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) 
(in the HRS, M=1.72, SD=2.06, Cronbach α=0.89) and anxiety symptoms were measured as 
a continuous variable using a short form version of the Beck Anxiety Inventory (in the HRS, 
M=1.64, SD=0.62, Cronbach α=0.80) (32,33).
Potential behavioral and biological pathway covariates that link optimism with cognitive 
impairment were also considered. Behavioral covariates included cigarette smoking status 
(never, former, current), frequency of alcohol consumption (abstinent, less than 1 or 2 days 
per month, 1 to 2 days per week, and more than 3 days per week), and frequency of 
moderate (e.g., gardening, walking at a moderate pace) and vigorous exercise (e.g., running, 
swimming) reported as never, 1–4 times per month, more than once a week.
Biological covariates included self-reported weight in pounds, converted into kilograms, and 
height in inches, converted into meters (used to calculate body mass index [BMI] according 
to kg/m2). Biological covariates also included heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes 
(each yes/no based on self-report of a doctor’s diagnosis).

 Statistical Analyses
We conducted multiple logistic regression analyses because we did not have exact dates for 
when cognitive impairment began, and onset may have occurred prior to our assessment 
dates. Therefore, timing of assessment cannot be equated with the timing of cognitive 
impairment. The impact of covariates on the association between optimism and cognitive 
impairment was estimated by adjusting for blocks of covariates. Model 1 adjusted for age 
and gender. Model 2, the core model, considered the impact of potential sociodemographic 
confounders and therefore included race/ethnicity, marital status, educational degree, and 
total wealth. Model 3 comprised the core model + health behaviors (smoking status, 
exercise, alcohol frequency). Model 4 comprised the core model + biological factors (heart 
disease, hypertension, diabetes, BMI). In these models, the degree of reduction in the 
association between optimism and cognitive impairment may be considered suggestive of 
the degree to which each block of variables is on the pathway linking optimism to cognitive 
impairment. We also created a Model 5, which included all covariates.
Sensitivity analyses were performed. First, we used multiple linear regression models to 
examine the association between optimism and continuous cognitive scores at follow-up. 
Second, we examined the impact of including older adults aged 51 to < 65 years of age 
(n=6,999) on the association between optimism and cognitive impairment. Since the HRS 
gives an abbreviated cognitive test to these younger participants (27 total points versus 35 
total points), cognitive scores of less than 8 points at follow-up were defined as cognitive 
impairment for this group, per previous research (34). Third, we examined if optimism-
cognitive impairment associations were maintained after adjusting for depression and 
anxiety symptoms. Since depression may cause short-term concentration problems that 
could translate into lower cognitive scores, we also adjusted for depression symptoms at 
follow-up in 2010. Fourth, we evaluated a potential threshold effect by considering tertiles of 
optimism. Fifth, to assess if associations might be due to reverse causality (i.e., having 
undiagnosed cognitive impairment may lead to lower optimism), we re-examined the 
primary association after excluding all cases of cognitive impairment that developed within 
two years of baseline. Sixth, we re-examined associations after excluding people with 
borderline cognitive impairment at baseline (i.e., scored within one standard deviation of the 
cutoff— score= 11 to 15). Seventh, we re-examined the primary association of interest while 
simultaneously excluding both people who developed cognitive impairment within two years 
of baseline and people who were on the borderline of cognitive impairment. Eighth, we 
tested for a potential interaction between type of cognitive assessment (TICS-M or 
IQCODE) and optimism and for a potential interaction between optimism and gender. 
Finally, we conducted a sensitivity analysis re-examining the primary association of interest 
while controlling for baseline cognitive scores. Glymour et al. 2005 cautions that controlling 
for baseline cognitive scores may inflate the association with the independent variable (35). 
Therefore, we did not control for baseline cognitive scores in our main models. Logits were 
converted into odds ratios (ORs) for ease of interpretation. All analyses were conducted 
using Stata version 13 (StataCorp).

 Missing Data Analyses
For all study variables, the overall item non-response rate was only 2.58%. However, 
missing data were distributed across variables, resulting in a 29.80% loss of respondents 
with complete-case analyses. To examine the impact of missing data and to obtain less 
biased estimates, a multivariate normal multiple imputation procedure was used to impute all 
missing data. Because results were largely the same between the original and imputed 
datasets, we used the dataset with multiple imputation for all reported analyses as this 
provides a more accurate estimate of association than other methods of handling missing 
data (36).
Results
Descriptive Analyses
At baseline, the average age of respondents was 75.00 years (SD=10.88). Respondents 
identified as being European-American (86%), African-American (8%), Hispanic (5%), or 
“Other” (1%). Respondents were primarily female (57%) and married (58%), and also 
reported having a high school degree (56%) or having attended some college (23%). At 
baseline, 120 people were cognitively impaired and therefore removed from analyses. There 
were 232 participants that developed cognitive impairment at the two-year follow-up. There 
were 559 total cases of cognitive impairment observed over the four-year course of this 
study. Of the 559 total cases of cognitive impairment, 62 (26.72%) went from being 
impaired at year two of follow-up to unimpaired at year four of follow-up. Therefore, 
because of the 62 people who went from impaired at year two of follow-up to not impaired 
at year four of follow-up, the total number of people impaired at year four of follow-up is 
497 (306 women and 191 men). These numbers are in keeping with previous research on 
incidence rates of cognitive impairment in the HRS (37). Of the 4,624 participants in this 
study, 4,065 of them remained cognitively unimpaired throughout the entirety of the study. 
The Spearman rank correlation between optimism scores at baseline and change in 
continuous 35-item cognitive function scores over four-year follow-up was 0.07 (p<.001). 
Optimism scores at baseline were also correlated (Spearman rank correlation coefficient) 
with 35-item cognitive function scores at baseline (rs= 0.24, p<.001). The 35-item cognitive 
function scores at baseline were correlated with cognitive scores at four-year follow-up 
(rs=0.66, p<.001). Table 1 describes the distribution of covariates across optimism tertiles.
Optimism and Risk of Becoming Cognitively Impaired
Inverse associations between optimism and likelihood of becoming cognitively impaired 
were evident across all five models. In the core model (Model 2), each standard deviation 
increase in optimism was associated with a multivariate-adjusted OR of 0.72 for cognitive 
impairment (95% CI, 0.62–0.83), whereby people with higher optimism were at lower risk 
for becoming cognitively impaired over the follow-up period. When considering each set of 
potential pathway covariates (e.g., behavioral, biological pathways), associations between 
optimism and cognitive impairment were somewhat attenuated but remained significant in 
all models (Table 2, Models 3–5).

 Controlling for Depression and Anxiety Symptoms
Adding depression or anxiety symptoms as continuous variables sequentially to the base 
model resulted in only a modest decrease in the strength of the association between 
optimism and cognitive impairment. For example, with anxiety symptoms the multivariate-
adjusted OR for optimism was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.67–0.89). When including depression 
symptoms, the multivariate-adjusted OR for optimism was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.66–0.89). When 
including both forms of distress simultaneously, the association between optimism and 
cognitive impairment was maintained (OR=0.79, 95% CI, 0.69–0.92). Finally, we controlled 
for depression symptoms at follow-up (2010) (Table S1 in Supplemental Digital Content 1) 
and found that the association between optimism and cognitive impairment was maintained 
in all models.
Additional Analyses
When examining tertiles of optimism, the results suggested a dose-response relationship 
(Table 3). For example, in the core model (Table 3, Model 2) compared to those with the 
lowest optimism, people with moderate optimism had a somewhat reduced risk (OR=0.79, 
95% CI, 0.59–1.03), while those with the highest optimism had the lowest risk of cognitive 
impairment (OR=0.53, 95% CI, 0.356–0.78). This pattern was maintained in all models 
(Table 3, Models 1–5). After excluding any cases of cognitive impairment that developed 
within 2 years of baseline (n=4,407), the association between optimism and cognitive 
impairment risk was maintained in all models (Table 4, Models 1–5), and the magnitude of 
reduction in risk was virtually unchanged (OR=0.69, 95% CI, 0.59–0.80; Table 4, Model 2). 
Similarly, after excluding people with borderline cognitive impairment scores at baseline 
(n=4,075), the primary association was maintained in all models (Table 5, Models 1–5), with 
little change in the magnitude of the odds ratios and confidence intervals (OR=0.68, 95% CI, 
0.56–0.83; Table 5, Model 2). We also re-ran analyses excluding both people who developed 
cognitive impairment within two years of baseline and people who were on the borderline of 
cognitive impairment but not cognitively impaired (n=3,972). Again, the estimates of 
association (OR=0.68, 95% CI, 0.56–0.82) were mostly indistinguishable from the original 
findings (Table S2 in Supplemental Digital Content 1, Models 1–5). Further, the association 
between optimism and cognitive impairment was maintained when controlling for baseline 
cognitive scores (Table S3 in Supplemental Digital Content 1, Models 1–5), though the 
strength of the association was attenuated (OR=0.784, 95% CI, 0.67–0.91; Table S3 in 
Supplemental Digital Content 1, Model 2). When examining the association between 
optimism and continuous cognitive scores at follow-up, for each standard deviation increase 
in optimism, cognitive scores increased by approximately 0.80 points after adjusting for 
sociodemographic factors (Table S4 in Supplemental Digital Content 1, Model 2). The 
inclusion of adults aged 51 to < 65 years old who were given the abbreviated cognitive test 
had little impact on the magnitude of reduction in risk (OR=0.74, 95% CI, 0.67–0.83; Table 
S5 in Supplemental Digital Content 1, Model 2). In addition, we found no evidence of an 
interaction between the type of cognitive assessment (TICS-M or IQCODE) and optimism 
(p=0.36). We also found no evidence of an association between gender and optimism 
(p=0.66).

 Discussion
We examined a nationally representative sample of older U.S. adults with normal cognitive 
function at baseline, and found that each standard deviation increase in optimism was 
associated with substantially reduced odds of becoming cognitively impaired over a four-
year period (OR=0.72, 95% CI, 0.62–0.83). We also observed a dose-response relationship, 
whereby as optimism increased, risk of cognitive impairment decreased monotonically. The 
association between optimism and cognitive impairment was maintained after taking into 
account sociodemographic, health behavior, and biological factors, as well as the presence of 
depression and anxiety symptoms. The association was somewhat attenuated after adjusting 
for demographics, which may be due in part to the strong association of optimism with 
education, and given that educational attainment has been strongly linked with cognitive 
decline (38). That said, the association between optimism and cognitive decline remained 
robust even after accounting for education and other sociodemographic variables. Prior work 
has found that optimism is strongly patterned by both education and income, and it may be 
one mechanism by which social disparities in health occur (39). Future work might directly 
test if optimism mediates the effects of educational attainment on cognitive decline. 
Moreover, our results are consistent with past studies which show that optimism’s 
association with health outcomes is only partially explained by behavioral and disease-
related risk factors, suggesting that these potentially mediating factors account for a small 
proportion of variance (4). Our findings are also consistent with work suggesting that 
associations between optimism and positive health outcomes are not merely due to the 
absence of depression or anxiety symptoms (4,14). Therefore, optimism may work through 
other mechanisms to reduce risk of cognitive impairment.
A growing body of research suggests that optimism promotes positive health through both 
indirect and direct pathways. Health behavior is one indirect pathway. Optimism is 
associated with better health behaviors in older adults, including being more physically 
active and abstaining from smoking (40). Although we controlled for relevant health 
behaviors, it is possible we did not include all behaviors that affect risk of cognitive 
impairment. There may be other pathways we were unable to measure in the current study. 
For example, people with higher optimism tend to eat healthier diets and manage stress more 
effectively (8,40). Research also indicates that more optimistic people may have better 
capacity to self-regulate and experience higher levels of positive emotions; more optimistic 
individuals tend to approach difficult life circumstances with more confidence about the 
future, and engage in more effortful problem solving, but are also more willing to adjust 
goals when they become unattainable (41–44). More optimistic people are also more likely 
to seek social support, a key environmental factor that protects against cognitive decline 
(43,45,46).
In addition to indirect pathways, researchers hypothesize that optimism may have direct 
biological effects that promote positive health outcomes. High levels of inflammatory 
cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein are associated with increased 
risk of cognitive impairment (13). Prior research has found that higher levels of optimism 
are associated with lower levels of inflammation (9,10). Other research suggests that 
optimism is also associated with high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, an anti-

 inflammatory lipoprotein hypothesized to protect cognitive function (47,48). Finally, 
numerous health conditions have been identified as risk factors for cognitive impairment, 
including stroke, diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension (12,13). Accumulating evidence 
suggests higher optimism leads to lower risk of developing these conditions (4,8,14). Further 
investigations are needed to clarify the biological mechanisms underlying the observed 
protective effect of optimism on cognitive impairment.
This study has several limitations. The assessment of cognitive impairment available in the 
HRS did not differentiate subtypes of cognitive impairment (e.g. mixed/vascular dementia, 
amnestic/non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment), and effects of optimism might vary 
depending on type of cognitive impairment. It is also worth noting that the cognitive 
assessment used does not definitively establish clinical diagnosis of dementia, so it is 
possible that some cases of cognitive impairment may be due to other causes such as head 
injury, meningitis, or thyroid dysfunction. However, the cut-off scores used in this study 
have shown high concordance with clinical dementia in prior research (49). It is also 
possible that optimism itself may influence self-report of health behaviors and health 
information. One study found that people with higher optimism were more likely to 
underestimate their weight compared to people with higher pessimism (50). Given the nature 
of observational data and shorter follow-up periods, we cannot fully rule out concerns about 
unmeasured confounders or reverse causality. However, we ran several sensitivity analyses 
to mitigate concerns about reverse causality. In all of these analyses, we found that the 
association between optimism and cognitive impairment was maintained. Although further 
research is needed, our findings suggest that optimism precedes the development of 
cognitive impairment. Finally, it is possible that a shared genetic predisposition to both low 
optimism and cognitive impairment may underlie the association observed in this study. To 
date optimism genes have not been identified, and candidate genes remain debated (51). 
However, previous research has demonstrated that optimism is partially heritable, and 
therefore future studies may seek to exclude possible genetic confounding by studying the 
association between optimism and cognitive impairment in twins or other related 
individuals.
This study also has several strengths, including a large and nationally representative sample, 
a prospective study design, and capacity to adjust for a wide array of potential confounders. 
Further, many large-scale longitudinal studies do not include proxy measures of cognitive 
impairment. The inclusion of proxy assessments in this study makes underestimation of the 
prevalence of cognitive impairment less likely (27,52).
The rapidly growing population of older adults in the United States is projected to result in 
an increasing number of people who develop cognitive impairment. Our findings indicate 
that higher optimism is associated with reduced risk of developing cognitive impairment, 
and several studies suggest that optimism is potentially modifiable (15,16). Further research 
should examine whether optimism induced by interventions is associated with the same 
health benefits as naturally occurring optimism. If future research supports findings from 
this study, supplementing current cognitive impairment prevention measures with 
interventions that have been shown to dependably enhance facets of positive psychological 
functioning, such as optimism, may be warranted (15,16,19).
