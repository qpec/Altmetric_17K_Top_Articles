 are mainly African American/Black and Hispanic. Heterosexuals comprise 24% of newly reported 
HIV infections in the U.S, but experience complex multi-level barriers to HIV testing.
Methods—We recruited African American/Black and Hispanic HHR in a discrete urban area 
with both elevated HIV prevalence and poverty rates. Approaches tested were: 1) respondent-
driven sampling (RDS) and confidential HIV testing in two sessions (n=3116); 2) RDS and 
anonymous HIV testing in one session (n=498); and 3) venue-based sampling (VBS) and HIV 
testing in a single session (n=403). The main outcome was newly diagnosed HIV infection.
Results—RDS with anonymous testing and one session reached HHR with less HIV testing 
experience and more risk factors than the other approaches. Further, RDS with anonymous (4.0%) 
and confidential (1.0%) testing yielded significantly higher rates of newly diagnosed HIV than 
VBS (0.3%).
Conclusion—Peer-referral approaches were more efficacious than VBS for uncovering HHR 
with undiagnosed HIV, particularly a single-session/anonymous strategy, and have a vital role to 
play in efforts to eliminate HIV transmission.

INTRODUCTION
Despite a decreasing trend in HIV transmission rates in the United States (US), an estimated 
44,000 individuals are infected with HIV each year.1 HIV disproportionately affects African 
American/Black and Hispanic populations from the lower socio-economic strata, due in part 
to insufficient HIV diagnostic testing.2 Approximately 15% of persons living with HIV 
(PLWH) are unaware of their status,3 yet a third of HIV transmission events are linked to 
those with undiagnosed HIV infection.4 Uncovering these undiagnosed cases, the first step 
to engagement along the HIV care continuum, remains both a public health priority and a 
significant challenge.5
Nationally, heterosexual sex is the second most common route of HIV transmission after 
male-to-male sexual contact, accounting for an estimated 24% of newly reported infections 
annually, and is the main route of transmission among women.1 Consistent with the CDC’s 
National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) system, we define heterosexuals at high-risk 
(HHR) for HIV as adults who are heterosexually active and socially networked within 
geographic areas with both excess HIV burden and socioeconomic disadvantage, referred to 
as “high-risk areas” (HRAs).6 HIV prevalence among heterosexuals overall is 0.1%, and 
2.0% among HHR.7 In New York City (NYC), data from the most recent NHBS cycle with 
published data estimated HIV prevalence among HHR at 9.6%.8
Heterosexuals in the US are less likely to be tested for HIV over their lifetimes compared to 
other risk groups such as MSM (43.5% [heterosexuals] vs. 69% [MSM]).9,10 Moreover, 
rates of regular, annual HIV testing are insufficient among HHR (approximately one third 
test annually).11 As a result, an estimated 25% of HIV-infected heterosexuals are

 undiagnosed.9 Furthermore, late HIV diagnosis is common among heterosexuals.12 Barriers 
at individual/attitudinal-, social-, and structural-levels of influence impede access to and 
uptake of HIV testing among HHR, including insufficient knowledge of HIV, substance use, 
fear of stigma, distrust of medical settings, social norms that deter HIV testing, and poor 
access to settings where high-quality HIV testing is offered.13,14 Thus potent, culturally 
appropriate, active approaches to seeking out HHR, reducing barriers to HIV testing, and 
providing high-quality HIV testing are critically needed.
Identifying HHR is challenging because many HHR are embedded within large urban 
populations of lower-risk heterosexual adults. Therefore, efficient methods are needed to 
identify persons among whom HIV prevention activities will yield significant impact. 
Recruitment methods such as respondent-driven sampling (RDS), a network-based peer-to-
peer recruitment strategy, and venue-based sampling (VBS), have been used in numerous 
research studies and intervention delivery settings for other high-risk populations such as 
MSM and persons who inject drugs (PWID).15 The CDC’s NHBS projects use RDS for 
recruiting HHR populations nationally,3,16 but the efficacy of RDS has not yet been directly 
tested alongside VBS for the purposes of identifying HHR with undiagnosed HIV.
This study compares the efficacy of three behavioral interventions to uncover undiagnosed 
HIV among HHR within an urban HRA in the US as part of the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse’s (NIDA) “Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain” (STTR) initiative. The present study 
describes the “Seek/Test” phase of these three interventions. Each intervention was guided 
by the Theory of Triadic Influence, a multi-level social-cognitive theory,17 integrated with 
Self Determination Theory18; was culturally appropriate for African American/Black and 
Hispanic HHR; addressed the multi-level barriers to HIV testing experienced by HHR 
described above; and had specific design features and advantages/disadvantages. 
Motivational Interviewing was used as the counseling approach in each intervention.19 To 
locate HHR within an urban HRA, RDS was used as the sampling method for two 
interventions, which provided either confidential or anonymous HIV testing, and a third 
used VBS.
METHODS
The present study used a non-randomized parallel study design. Similar to past NHBS 
studies,6,20 the present study was conducted in a well-defined HRA in central Brooklyn in 
New York City. As described elsewhere,21 for each Brooklyn ZIP code, an “HRA index” 
was calculated by combining Census-based poverty levels and case surveillance-based 
heterosexual HIV prevalence, with each standardized to the values of those variables for all 
Brooklyn ZIP codes together, and then ranked. Next, a core HRA (7 ZIP codes) was 
identified using the local indicators of spatial association (LISA) procedure.21 To reduce 
artificial restrictions on RDS recruitment, a larger HRA was then demarcated, adding 
remaining ZIP codes in the top 50% of the empirical distribution of the HRA index (12 
additional ZIP codes). The three interventions were conducted in the same HRA during the 
same time period (2012–2015). A study field site was established in the core HRA. The 
study received ethical approval from the New York University School of Medicine

 Institutional Review Board and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01607541, 
NCT02421159).
Description of the sampling methods and interventions
The first intervention used RDS as its recruitment method and consisted of two sessions, one 
to orient/engage participants and train them on peer recruitment, and the second providing 
confidential HIV counseling and rapid HIV testing (see Fig. 1). We refer to this as RDS-
CTT (“Confidential Two-session Testing”). RDS-CTT was comparable to HIV testing 
services provided in a medical/clinical setting. The second intervention was planned and 
implemented mid-way through RDS-CTT. It addressed early findings from RDS-CTT, such 
as perceived HIV stigma acting as a barrier to peer recruitment and that ~25% of participants 
in RDS-CTT did not return for session 2. This second intervention also used RDS as its 
recruitment method and was designed as a flexible, relatively brief, low-threshold approach 
to provide easy-access to HIV counseling and testing, and using anonymous HIV testing to 
reduce perceived stigma (called RDS-AST, “Anonymous Single-session Testing”). A 
laboratory-based blood test was conducted in the first session of RDS-AST to increase rates 
of test acceptance/completion. The third intervention enrolled participants using VBS and 
provided confidential HIV counseling and rapid HIV testing in a single session. Components 
were culturally targeted to the barriers African American/Black and Hispanic HHR 
experience to HIV testing (e.g., low perceived risk, fear of HIV stigma) and carried out by 
trained, mainly master’s level staff. 21,22 The study’s primary outcome was the proportion of 
newly diagnosed HIV infections identified. All three Seek/Test interventions included 
components to refer those testing HIV-negative to prevention services, and link newly 
diagnosed individuals to HIV primary care (i.e. a “Treat & Retain” study phase),21,22 not 
described here.
RDS resembles other social network strategies typically conducted within community-based 
organizations that use members of high-risk networks, extensive training of recruiters, and 
compensation for recruitment to identify other potentially high-risk persons.23 However, 
RDS is a less labor-intensive method than these social network strategies embedded in 
organizations. RDS is generally conducted in street or community-based settings, uses a 
short and streamlined peer-recruitment training protocol, and establishes upper limits on the 
numbers of peers that can be recruited in order to reach members of the population of 
interest who may be more easily missed, in part because they do not present to, or even 
actively avoid, organizational settings.24 The RDS aspect of the two RDS-based 
interventions were consistent with standard RDS procedures (e.g., number of recruits was 
rationed, relationships between recruiters and recruits were assessed).24
Based on local NHBS studies published at the time the study was planned25 and the 
literature on the effectiveness of peer recruitment in reaching vulnerable populations,5,15,26 
we hypothesized RDS-CTT and RSD-AST would be more effective than VBS in accessing 
populations at high-risk for undiagnosed HIV, and also that RDS-AST would yield a higher 
proportion of newly diagnosed HIV-infected persons (estimated 8%) with a shorter 
intervention than RDS-CTT (estimated 5%), with VBS showing the lowest yield (estimated 
3%). Further, to allow comparisons to past surveillance studies, we assessed HIV prevalence

 (i.e., both previously diagnosed and newly identified HIV infections) for RDS-CTT and 
RDS-AST. Thus the two RDS studies included those with previously diagnosed HIV to 
estimate HIV prevalence, but also as a means of identifying undiagnosed HIV infections 
among peers and to improve the validity of self-reported HIV status at initial study 
screening, because prior HIV diagnosis did not preclude study participation. Procedures are 
described in more detail elsewhere.21,22
Sampling
“Initial seeds” starting the RDS peer recruitment chains were recruited in, and VBS events 
were conducted in, the same core HRA in order to access HHR with comparable socio-
demographic characteristics. Sample size goals were approximately 400 for VBS, 3000 for 
RDS-CTT, and 500 for RDS-AST. For RDS-CTT, a total of 107 initial seeds, selected to 
vary in age, gender, and race/ethnicity, were directly recruited by study staff in 2012–2014 
from public and street venues within the core HRA. Each seed was encouraged to start a 
recruitment chain by recruiting 3–5 peers. These peers then entered the study and recruited 
their own peers until the sample size goals were met. RDS recruitment proceeds in “waves,” 
that is, a set of all peers recruited by the previous set, and these waves form recruitment 
chains, with equilibrium, or stability, on key variables generally reached after 5–6 waves.24 
Most (66.0%) participants in RDS-CTT recruited ≥1 peer (mean = 1.6; median = 1). 
Recruitment chain lengths ranged from 1 (just the seed, and no recruits) to 1184 (mean 
length = 28, SD = 119). RDS-AST began with 7 diverse initial seeds who recruited a total of 
491 peers; 66.1% recruited at least one peer (mean = 1.3; median = 1) with recruitment 
chain lengths ranging from 2 to 171 (mean length = 69, SD = 69). The longest recruitment 
chains were 25 and 21 waves deep for RDS-CTT and RDS-AST, respectively. Both RDS-
CTT and RDS-AST initial seeds and peers are included as participants in the present study.
VBS was conducted by randomly selecting venue-day-time units from a pre-specified 
sampling frame of all possible venues in the core HRA (with a venue defined as a city block 
with >70% commercial activity).21 The VBS intervention was conducted over 71 separate 
recruitment events, with the number of participants recruited at each event ranging from 1 to 
13 (mean recruits per event = 6, SD = 3). RDS-CTT and VBS were conducted 
simultaneously in 2012–2015, and RDS-AST was conducted in 2015 over six months after 
RDS-CTT enrollment was completed. Procedures were designed to prevent cross-enrollment 
in the interventions.21,22
Eligibility
The main study eligibility criteria were: age 18–60 years, sexually active with ≥1 opposite 
sex partner in the past year, resides in the HRA, comprehends English or Spanish, no prior 
participation in the study, and not actively psychotic (see Fig. 1). Additional inclusion 
criteria for VBS and initial seeds for RDS (but not peers) included negative/unknown HIV 
status by self-report and residence in the core HRA. Peers with a previous HIV diagnosis 
were enrolled in the RDS studies, as described above. VBS and RDS-CTT enrolled 
participants from African American/Black and Hispanic racial/ethnic backgrounds only. 
However, in keeping with RDS-AST as a type of adapted intervention, and to further reduce 
artificial restriction of recruitment chains, initial seeds for RDS-AST were African

 American/Black and Hispanic but there was no race/ethnicity criterion for peers, although 
we estimated <4% would be White based on past studies.25 Procedures in the RDS studies 
were constructed to increase veracity of self-reported HIV status at screening, including 
providing comparable activities and compensation rates for those with negative/unknown 
and previously diagnosed HIV, a design element that participants were trained to 
communicate to their social network members during peer recruitment. (Those with previous 
HIV diagnoses are not included in the present paper as described below.)
Procedures
Participants were either directly recruited in venues by staff (VBS) or by peers (RDS, with 
the exception of initial seeds). Those recruited by peers presented to the study with a coded 
recruitment coupon. Potential participants (in both RDS and VBS) were then guided through 
a verbal consent process and screened for eligibility with a brief structured assessment (10 
minutes). Those found eligible provided signed informed consent for remaining study 
activities and then completed a structured baseline interview lasting 30–60 minutes using an 
audio, computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) program. Participants received 
compensation for recruitment of peers ($15/eligible peer), $15 for screening interviews, and 
$30 for baseline interviews and interventions session(s), as well as funds for public 
transportation. Assessment instruments were drawn from a set of harmonized measures 
developed for the NIDA-funded STTR studies, and included socio-demographic/background 
factors, HIV testing history, sexual behavior, and drug and alcohol use patterns.27 VBS and 
RDS-AST used an abbreviated version of the full assessment battery. RDS-CTT and VBS 
used the OraQuick ADVANCE® Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test, followed by the OraSure 
confirmatory test, both with oral fluid. RDS-AST used the combination Antigen/Antibody 
Preliminary Test with Cascade Reflex to Supplementary Testing, a 4th generation test. 
(Because 4th generation tests detect HIV earlier than OraQuick/OraSure, we conducted 
OraQuick rapid tests in RDS-AST to allow direct comparison of results across studies. No 
discrepancies between test types were found.)
Statistical Analysis
The prevalence of previously undiagnosed HIV infection, the primary outcome, was 
estimated separately for each Seek/Test approach using RDS weights and bootstrapping, as 
implemented in the RDS package28 of the R statistical computing environment.29 Gile’s 
(2011) successive sampling (SS) approach was used for weighting, with one thousand SS 
samples per iteration.30 Ninety-eight thousand bootstrap samples were taken to estimate 
confidence intervals and make pairwise comparisons of Seek/Test approaches. The 
population size (residents of the seven HRA ZIP codes 18 years of age or older) was 
estimated as four hundred thousand.31 Interval estimates of relative risk were estimated 
using the method of variance estimates recovery (MOVER) approach.32 The same methods 
were used for when comparing approaches on secondary outcomes, demographic, 
background, health, relationship, and HIV testing history variables. Because efficiently 
reaching people at higher risk for HIV infection is part of how one seek strategy may be 
more effective than another, we do not include socio-demographic and other control 
variables when comparing Seek/Test strategies. All tests of statistical significance were two-
tailed, and P < 0.05 was considered significant.

 RESULTS
A total of 3116, 498, and 403 participants were enrolled in RDS-CTT, RDS-AST, and VBS 
approaches, respectively. As shown in Table 1, the prevalence of confirmed newly diagnosed 
HIV infection was higher among RDS-AST and RDS-CTT participants than among VBS 
participants, with prevalence nearly fifteen times higher in RDS-AST (RR = 14.89, 95% CI: 
1.01 – 48.18, P < .01) and more than three times higher in RDS-CTT (RR = 3.84, 95% CI: 
1.05 – 11.36, P = .03). Prevalence of newly diagnosed infection also was almost one-quarter 
as high among RDS-CTT (1%) than RDS-AST (4%), but this difference only approached 
statistical significance (RR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08 – 3.60, P = .06). The overall prevalence 
rates (i.e., previously and newly diagnosed) in the RDS cohorts were comparable: 7.4% 
(RDS-CTT) and 10.3% (RDS-AST).
We examined rates of engagement in study activities, which differed among the three 
approaches. Those in RDS-CTT were less likely than RDS-AST to be found eligible (RR = 
0.84, 95% CI: 0.78 – 0.90, P < .01). RDS-CTT participants found eligible were less likely 
than eligible persons in VBS to enroll and complete baseline interviews (RR = 0.90, 95% 
CI: 0.85 – 0.96, P < .01). All enrolled VBS and RDS-AST participants were offered an HIV 
test, which took place in the first intervention session. Among those offered an HIV test, 
almost all accepted it (≥ 96.7% accepted), with no significant differences by intervention 
approach.
As shown in Table 2, participants recruited by the three intervention approaches differed in a 
number of respects, with participants recruited by RDS-AST being least likely to have 
regular, annual HIV testing and most likely to have both sexual and substance use risk 
factors compared to participants recruited by RDS-CTT and VBS.
Compared with VBS, RDS-AST participants were more likely to be at least 40 years old 
(RR = 2.02), and to have been homeless (RR = 1.39). RDS-AST participants were also more 
likely than VBS participants to have lifetime (RR = 1.35) and recent (RR = 1.74) 
incarceration, hepatitis C virus infection (RR = 2.74), lifetime (RR = 2.80) and recent 
injection drug use (RR = 3.08), drug use by any route of administration in the past month 
(RR = 2.17), drug use weekly or more often in the past month (RR = 2.71), condomless sex 
(RR = 1.30), and multiple sex partners (RR = 2.72). RDS-AST participants were less likely 
than VBS participants to be employed (RR = 0.46) and to have lifetime (RR = 0.85), past-
year (RR = 0.60), and regular, annual HIV testing (RR = 0.60).
Compared with VBS, RDS-CTT participants were more likely to be at least 40 years old 
(RR = 1.71) and were more likely to have been homeless (RR = 1.30). RDS-CTT 
participants were also more likely than VBS participants to have lifetime incarceration (RR 
= 1.21). RDS-CTT participants were less likely than VBS participants to be employed (RR = 
0.52) and to have lifetime (RR = 0.96) or past-year HIV testing (RR = 0.81).
Compared with RDS-AST, RDS-CTT participants were more likely to have clinically 
significant levels of depressive symptoms (RR = 1.61) as well as lifetime (RR = 1.13), past-
year (RR = 1.35), and annual HIV testing (RR = 1.79). RDS-CTT participants were less 
likely than RDS-AST participants to have past-year incarceration (RR = 0.61), a lifetime

 STI diagnosis (RR = 0.71), hepatitis C infection (RR = 0.43), lifetime (RR = 0.43) and 
recent (RR = 0.32) injection drug use, drug use by any route of administration in the past 
month (RR = 0.49), an alcohol (RR = 0.64), drug use (RR = 0.49), or substance use problem 
(RR = 0.61), drug use weekly or more often in the past month (RR = 0.36), condomless sex 
(RR = 0.85), multiple sex partners (RR = 0.45), and lifetime transactional sex/exchanging 
sex for money/drugs (RR = 0.64).
In sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome of confirmed newly diagnosed HIV infection, 
we excluded all participants with lifetime injection drug use (n = 390). Among VBS 
participants who did not report lifetime injection drug use, none tested positive for HIV 
infection (i.e., both VBS participants with newly diagnosed HIV infection had injected 
drugs). With people who had injected drugs excluded, prevalence of confirmed newly 
diagnosed HIV infection was still more than four times higher among RDS-AST participants 
(3.98%) than among RDS-CTT participants (0.93%), but this difference was not statistically 
significant (RR = 4.26, 95% CI: 0.11 – 17.57, P = .11). In other words, excluding 
participants with lifetime injection drug use led to a small reduction in the yield of newly 
diagnosed infections in both RDS-AST and RDS-CTT, with RDS-AST showing the same 
sizeable but not statistically significant advantage over RDS-CTT.
DISCUSSION
Efficient and potent active approaches to detect undiagnosed HIV among HHR are sorely 
needed to achieve the goal of elimination of HIV transmission in the US, and the present 
study addresses this gap in available HIV prevention programs. We examined the efficacy of 
three intervention strategies to uncover undiagnosed HIV infection among HHR by seeking 
them out in their communities and providing HIV counseling and testing. Moreover, this is 
the first direct comparison of RDS and VBS to identify undiagnosed HIV prevalence among 
HHR.
All three approaches yielded samples with high rates of serious risk factors such as 
incarceration, unemployment, and homelessness, particularly those in RDS-AST. 
Importantly, more than half the RDS-AST sample (60.1%) experienced substance use 
problems in the past year, and recent drug use was common (64.4%). Moreover, the RDS-
AST sample had the lowest rates of past-year and annual HIV testing compared to the other 
groups – risk and behavioral factors that likely contribute substantially to ongoing 
undiagnosed HIV in the population. RDS-AST and RDS-CTT yielded comparable HIV 
prevalence rates (10.3%, 7.4%), higher than national estimates for HHR (2.0%)7 and 
roughly comparable to past local NHBS surveillance studies.8 Of the three interventions, 
RDS-AST yielded the highest rate of newly diagnosed HIV (4.0%), followed by RDS-CTT 
(1.0%), and then VBS (0.3%). Retention to study activities was acceptable in all three 
interventions, and almost all (>95%) accepted HIV testing when it was offered. Past research 
has noted that successful HIV testing programs are convenient, address confidentiality 
issues, and have credibility.33 The low-threshold approach used in RDS-AST in particular 
appears to have met these standards and as a result produced the highest yield of newly 
diagnosed individuals. On the other hand, RDS-CTT may have created barriers to study 
completion and reached a lower-risk sample. In future research we will examine the efficacy

 of the two RDS studies with respect to HIV care linkage, retention in care, and health 
outcomes.
We found VBS was feasible but yielded a substantially lower proportion of newly diagnosed 
HIV than the two RDS approaches. This suggests VBS is not an optimal STTR approach for 
HHR, perhaps because heterosexuals at high-risk for HIV are embedded in physical spaces 
that include lower-risk individuals, and VBS is an inefficient means of gaining access to 
those at highest risk. These findings, on the other hand, underscore the utility of peer-
recruitment methods such as RDS, particularly in conjunction with interventions that 
provide HIV testing at the first contact, and which directly address potential issues of 
perceived stigma, for example, through anonymous testing. This may be in part because 
peers have credibility that fosters the engagement of hidden and at-risk members of social 
networks, who may not be present in social venues, including service organizations, and/or 
who are not ordinarily willing to engage with HIV testing programs in a setting such as 
VBS.26 The yield of newly diagnosed HIV in the three interventions was lower than 
hypothesized based on local surveillance studies.25 These lower than expected proportions 
may reflect truly lower rates, due to the active, comprehensive, and rapidly evolving local 
HIV prevention strategies implemented in New York City.34 As of 2012, New York State 
had one of the lowest rates of undiagnosed HIV (estimated 92.9% of persons living with 
diagnosed HIV).35 Thus the RDS approaches tested here are promising, particularly RDS-
AST, and, we postulate, would have an even greater yield in a context with higher rates of 
undiagnosed HIV. Alternately, lower rates of newly diagnosed HIV in RDS-CTT may have 
emerged from departures from NHBS methodologies, such as testing for HIV in the second 
session. This suggests variations in the components and timing of seek/test strategies can 
impact sample composition with respect to risk factors and yield of undiagnosed HIV 
infection. Nonetheless, NYC has nearly 3,000 new HIV cases each year, almost all from 
African American/Black and Hispanic backgrounds.34 Thus STTR approaches are vital, 
albeit challenging, even in contexts with relatively low rates of undiagnosed HIV such as 
NYC.
Limitations
Study limitations include the use of self-reported HIV status to identify undiagnosed HIV 
infection. Indeed, other studies have found nondisclosure of HIV status, particularly when 
participants would be denied financial compensation if they so disclosed.36 The present 
study was designed to reduce psychosocial incentives for participants to mask their HIV-
infected status at enrollment as described above, yet it is possible some individuals classified 
as newly diagnosed individuals were previously aware of their HIV infection. Anonymous 
HIV testing might increase rates of testing acceptance but precludes linkage to the local HIV 
surveillance registry to verify whether the individual received an HIV diagnosis. Yet recently 
low-cost screening for antiretroviral (ART) use has emerged as a potentially valuable 
objective biomarker assessment of knowledge of HIV infection, although capturing only 
those on ART.36 Further, despite its advantages, RDS is subject to potential biases; for 
example, by potentially over-recruiting from social networks that differ in key respects from 
the underlying target population.20 RDS sampling in the present study proceeded over a 
large number of recruitment waves, thereby increasing the probability that the samples are

 broadly representative of the underlying population.24 Also, the study did not randomize 
individuals to the different methods of recruitment. However, some situations are not 
amenable to randomized designs, such as the public health and scientific questions examined 
here.37 Further, power to detect differences among Seek/Test approaches on the primary 
outcome was reduced by the prevalence of newly diagnosed HIV infection, which was lower 
than expected based on previous work.
Public health implications
This study is the first to prospectively demonstrate the value of potentially replicable Seek/
Test interventions to identify HHR with undiagnosed HIV, namely, interventions that use 
peer-referral, focus on a large socially networked population, are located in high HIV 
prevalence areas, and include well-trained staff and culturally focused components to 
motivate peer recruitment and foster engagement in study activities. As such, it provides 
further support for the utility of social network methods to identify undiagnosed HIV. The 
three interventions were successful in finding and engaging a high-risk population of HHR 
with suboptimal rates of past-year HIV testing. The brief, single session RDS-AST 
intervention yielded the greatest proportion of those newly diagnosed with HIV, and VBS 
yielded the lowest proportion. Because the factors that impede HIV testing among HHR are 
complex, serious, and long-standing, community-based STTR approaches are needed, with 
an emphasis on active outreach, low-threshold, and peer-based methods. Implemented on a 
continual basis in urban HRAs, such approaches can complement institutionally based HIV 
testing programs and play a vital role in eliminating HIV transmission by promoting regular 
HIV testing among populations at high risk for HIV, including substance users.
