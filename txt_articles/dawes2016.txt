IMPORTANCE Bariatric surgery is associated with sustained weight loss and improved physical
health status for severely obese individuals. Mental health conditions may be common
among patients seeking bariatric surgery; however, the prevalence of these conditions
and whether they are associated with postoperative outcomes remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of mental health conditions among bariatric surgery
candidates and recipients, to evaluate the association between preoperative mental health
conditions and health outcomes following bariatric surgery, and to evaluate the association
between surgery and the clinical course of mental health conditions.
DATA SOURCES We searched PubMed, MEDLINE on OVID, and PsycINFO for studies
published between January 1988 and November 2015. Study quality was assessed using an
adapted tool for risk of bias; quality of evidence was rated based on GRADE (Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria.
FINDINGS We identified 68 publications meeting inclusion criteria: 59 reporting the
prevalence of preoperative mental health conditions (65 363 patients) and 27 reporting
associations between preoperative mental health conditions and postoperative outcomes
(50 182 patients). Among patients seeking and undergoing bariatric surgery, the most
common mental health conditions, based on random-effects estimates of prevalence, were
depression (19% [95% CI, 14%-25%]) and binge eating disorder (17% [95% CI, 13%-21%]).
There was conflicting evidence regarding the association between preoperative mental
health conditions and postoperative weight loss. Neither depression nor binge eating
disorder was consistently associated with differences in weight outcomes. Bariatric surgery
was, however, consistently associated with postoperative decreases in the prevalence of
depression (7 studies; 8%-74% decrease) and the severity of depressive symptoms
(6 studies; 40%-70% decrease).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mental health conditions are common among bariatric
surgery patients—in particular, depression and binge eating disorder. There is inconsistent
evidence regarding the association between preoperative mental health conditions and
postoperative weight loss. Moderate-quality evidence supports an association between
bariatric surgery and lower rates of depression postoperatively.

ariatric surgery is an accepted method of promoting
weight loss and improving obesity-related physical co-
morbidities in severely obese individuals.1-4 Mental
health conditions have received less attention. Approximately
19% of US residents have a mental health condition,5 including
8%withdepression6and1%to5%withbingeeatingdisorder.7,8
These conditions may be more common among patients seek-
ing bariatric surgery than in the general population.9-12 How-
ever, published prevalence estimates vary13,14 and no system-
atic reviews describe the prevalence of conditions such as
depression, substance abuse, and eating disorders.
We conducted a systematic review with 3 aims: (1) to esti-
mate the prevalence of mental health conditions in patients
seeking and undergoing bariatric surgery; (2) to evaluate the
association between preoperative mental health conditions
and weight loss after surgery; and (3) to evaluate the associa-
tion between surgery and the clinical course of mental health
conditions.
Methods
We convened an expert panel to define the scope of our
review and develop the protocol.15 Our PROSPERO registra-
tion number is CRD42014008675. Based on input from our
panel, we defined mental health conditions as depression,
anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), personality
disorders, substance abuse disorders, suicidality or suicidal
ideation, and eating disorders—primarily binge eating disor-
der. Eating behaviors not classified as disorders (eg, grazing
and cognitive restraint) and cigarette smoking were outside
our scope.
We used weight loss as our postoperative bariatric out-
come. Mental health outcomes included suicide incidence and
the prevalence, symptoms, and treatment of mental health
conditions. We defined persons seeking or being evaluated for
bariatric surgery as candidates to distinguish them from popu-
lations in which all patients received surgery (recipients).
We searched PubMed, MEDLINE on OVID, and PsycINFO
for English-language studies published before November 23,
2015. Search terms included bariatric, obesity, the names of
surgical procedures, psychiatric disorders, and eating disor-
ders (eAppendix in the Supplement). We supplemented our
search with: (1) citations from an earlier systematic review by
Livhits and colleagues11 (search dates 1988-2010); (2) studies
recommended by our technical expert panel; and (3) refer-
ence mining of included articles.
For inclusion, each study had to address at least 1 specific
aim(ie,prevalence,associations,orboth),reportfindingsfrom
primary research, and report data for adults (≥18 years) with a
body mass index (BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared]) of at least 35. We re-
quired all mental health diagnoses to be made preoperatively
and excluded studies that asked patients to recall their pre-
operative health status.
We required studies that reported prevalence data to
measure mental health conditions using a formal method
(such as a validated instrument or the Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal Manual of Mental Health Disorders-5-SCID (Fifth Edition,
Structured Clinical Interview). Studies using a diagnostic
scale to make diagnoses had to report a threshold value and
the corresponding prevalence estimate. For example, we
included studies stating, “15% of candidates had major
depressive disorder based on a Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI) threshold of 20,
” but not studies reporting, “the mean
BDI score was 25.
”
Association studies were also required to make the diag-
nosis of mental health conditions preoperatively, but these
studies were allowed to report either prevalence or nonpreva-
lence measurements of postoperative health status as long as
they were formally assessed. For example, we included asso-
ciation studies reporting a change in mean BDI after surgery
even if a threshold for the diagnosis of depression was not
stated.
Two independent reviewers assessed each study for in-
clusion and extracted data including country, patient compo-
sition (candidates vs recipients), method of recruitment,
sample demographics, details of the operation, mental health
conditions assessed, methods of assessment, and whether the
surgical team was blinded to the assessment. This final item
was added based on evidence that prevalence estimates may
be higher if patients are told their response will not be shared
with the surgical team.16 Discrepancies were reconciled
through discussion.
We estimated the prevalence of each mental health con-
dition using a random-effects meta-analysis for pooled
binomial data.17 We performed formal tests of heterogeneity
using the I2 statistic.18 We also explored for potential hetero-
geneity by stratifying our analyses on variables potentially
related to either true differences in prevalence or the
risk of bias, including study population (candidates vs recipi-
ents), study design (randomized vs observational, consecu-
tive vs nonconsecutive sampling), and, for depression,
whether the diagnosis was made using a scale or clinical
interview. We compared estimates between subgroups using
meta-regression19; finding no statistically significant differ-
ences, we present only unstratified data. All analyses were
conducted using Stata 12.1.
If studies reported both lifetime and current prevalence,
we used current values; if the timeline was not specified, we
assumed data pertained to current prevalence. If studies used
multiple methods to diagnose a mental health condition, our
studypsychiatristselectedthemostrelevantmeasure.Wecom-
pared summary estimates for each condition with published
estimates for the US population and considered a relative in-
crease of 25% or greater to be clinically relevant.
For association studies, we classified articles as those mea-
suring bariatric outcomes vs mental health outcomes. Re-
sults were further grouped by the outcome being measured.
Given the variability in study design and outcome measure-
ment, association data were reported narratively.
A preliminary search returned a large number of small,
single-institution observational studies. To assess their value,
we first restricted eligibility to studies with more than 500 par-
ticipants, calculated weighted median estimates, and then
compared our results with estimates calculated under a re-

laxed criterion (≥ 200 participants). Because no differences
were found, we concluded that further relaxing the threshold
to include studies with sample sizes of less than 200 would
be very unlikely to influence our results. We, therefore, re-
stricted our final analyses to: (1) randomized controlled trials
(RCTs); (2) multi-institutional observational studies; (3) single-
institution studies with random or consecutive sampling and
a sample size of at least 200; and (4) single-institution stud-
ies with nonconsecutive sampling and a sample size of at least
500. Even with these restrictions, our sample included 70%
of published patient data.
We assessed the quality of included studies by adapting
existing quality assessment tools.20,21 We selected 6 items re-
lated to risk of bias (study design, sampling strategy, follow-up
rate at primary end point, criterion standard for diagnosis,
whether assessments were kept confidential, and controlling
for confounders) and 1 item each on generalizability (multi-
site vs single site) and statistical power (sample size).
We rated the quality of evidence for each finding based
on criteria established by the GRADE (Grading of Recom-
mendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)
Working Group.22 Quality was classified as high, moderate,
low, or very low based on study design, magnitude of the
association, and consistency of the results across studies. All
classifications were determined by consensus among the
research team.
Results
Our literature search yielded 2191 titles. To this, we added 79
citations from Livhits and colleagues11 and 15 references
identified by our expert panel. Of these, 567 articles
addressed our specific aims (Figure). After screening, 68
articles met inclusion criteria (59 regarding prevalence of
mental health conditions; 27 regarding associations between
preoperative mental health conditions and postoperative
outcomes). Eighteen of these articles contributed to both
analyses.
Prevalence of Mental Health Conditions
We identified 59 publications reporting prevalence data from
52 studies (eTable and eReferences in the Supplement). The
most commonly studied condition was depression (34 stud-
ies) followed by binge eating disorder (25), and anxiety (22).
In general, 70% to 80% of patients were women, the mean age
was 40 to 50 years, and the mean BMI was 45 to 50.
Random-effects pooled estimates for the prevalence of
each mental health condition are presented in Table 1. Condi-
tions ranged in prevalence from any mood disorder (23% [95%
CI, 15%-31%]) to psychosis (1% [95% CI, 0%-1%]). The 3 most
common individual diagnoses were depression (19% [95% CI,
14%-25%]), binge eating disorder (17% [95% CI, 13%-21%]), and
anxiety (12% [95% CI, 6%-20%]). Prevalence estimates were
9% (95% CI, 5%-13%) for previous suicidal ideation, 3% (95%
CI, 1%-4%) for substance abuse disorders, and 1% (95% CI, 1%-
2%) for PTSD. I2 statistics were high for all estimates, ranging
from 57% to 99%.
The quality of evidence was moderate regarding an
increased prevalence of mental health conditions among bar-
iatric patients based on the number of studies and the
moderate-to-large magnitude of the prevalence difference.
At 23%, the prevalence of any mood disorder among bariatric
patients was greater than the US population estimate of
10%.23 The prevalence of depression (19%) and binge eating
disorder (17%) was also greater among bariatric patients than
in the general US population (8% for depression; 1%-5% for
binge eating disorder).6-8

ported in prevalence studies. Table 2 summarizes each study;
quality assessments are listed in Table 3. Of the 26 studies, 18
were prospective (including 3 RCTs) and 16 involved consecu-
tive sampling. Follow-up rates were high (>80% at the pri-
mary end point) in 9 of the 18 prospective studies, moderate
(60%-80%) in 7, and low (<60%) in 2. Fourteen of the 26 stud-
ies controlled for confounders (References 3, 14, 24, 26, 29-
35, 38, 40, 41, 47) using statistical methods or design; 3 stud-
ies used both matching and multivariable regression.3,32,34
There was inconsistent evidence regarding the associa-
tion between preoperative mental health conditions and
postoperative weight loss. Five studies reported on depres-
sion. The first found no difference in weight loss at 1 year but
less weight loss at 4 years for patients with preoperative
depression or anxiety (7.9- vs 12.5-unit decrease in BMI)
(P = .047).24 Four other studies found no difference in post-
operative weight loss between patients with and without pre-
operative depression. The first found no association between
preoperative depression and weight loss at 6 months (mean
difference in excess BMI loss, −0.6% [95% CI, −3.8% to 2.6%])
or 1 year after surgery (−1.9% [95% CI, −4.0% to 7.8%]).45 The
second found no association between BDI scores and weight
loss but reported a reduced risk of significant weight regain
(≥15% of total weight loss) in patients with higher preopera-
tive BDI scores (odds ratio, 0.94 per unit increase [95% CI,
0.91-0.98]).35 Although retrospective, this study controlled
for 14 preoperative and postoperative confounders. The third
reported no difference in percent BMI loss between patients
with and without depression (difference at 6 months, 27.8%
vs 27.8% [P = .95]; at 12 months, 35.8% vs 36.5% [P = .45];
and at 24 months, 38.3% vs 37.4% [P = .52]).48 This study had
a high follow-up rate at 6 months (85%) and at 12 months
(80%) but low follow-up at 24 months (47%). The fourth
study reported no difference in excess weight loss at 1 year
between patients with depression (43.4%) and those without
depression (43.9%; P = nonsignificant [exact value was not
provided]) but had a low follow-up rate (53%) and did not
control for cofounders.46 One study found no association
between a current mood disorder and weight loss 2 or 3 years
after surgery, but this study did not specifically report on
depression.41
Five studies (2 consecutive, 3 nonconsecutive) provided
mixed results regarding the association between preopera-
tive binge eating disorder and postoperative weight loss. One
consecutive-sample study found that patients with preop-
erative binge eating disorder lost more weight after surgery
(0.19 percentage point–greater decrease in BMI; P = .014),
while the other consecutive-sample study found no differ-
ence (Cohen d = 0.24; P = .29).26,31 The first monitored
patients with a current diagnosis of binge eating disorder for
4 years; the second included patients with a lifetime diagno-
sis of binge eating disorder and followed up patients up to 3
years after surgery. All 3 nonconsecutive sample studies,
including an RCT comparing 2 bariatric surgery procedures,
found no difference in weight loss between patients with
and without preoperative binge eating disorder.38,41,47 One
study47 involved patients with a lifetime diagnosis and
followed-up patients for 1 year; the other 2 studies involved
patients with a current diagnosis of binge eating disorder
and analyzed patients twice: at 1 year and then either 3 or 5
years after surgery.
The quality of evidence was very low for all associations
between preoperative mental health conditions and postop-
erative weight loss, with the exception of depression, for
which the quality of evidence was upgraded to low because
all 5 studies reported no difference in postoperative weight
loss at 1 year.
Bariatric Surgery and Postoperative Mental Health Outcomes
Bariatric surgery was associated with lower rates and fewer
symptoms of multiple mental health conditions, particularly
depression. Depression improved following bariatric surgery
in 11 of the 12 studies (References 14, 25, 27, 28, 33, 36, 39, 42-
44, 48) including 2 RCTs that evaluated behavioral health
interventions after surgery. This included a reduction in
both depression prevalence14,25,27,33,41,43,48 and the fre-
quency and severity of depressive symptoms.14,28,36,39,42,44
Ten studies were prospective (5 with high follow-up, 5 with
moderate) and 3 controlled for confounding using multi-
variable regression.
Two RCTs evaluating behavioral health interventions
after bariatric surgery found improvements in depression
for both the intervention group and the usual-care group.
One study found lower rates of depression at 6 months and
1 year after surgery for participants in a comprehensive
behavioral-motivational program and controls, with slightly

bRandomization does not control for confounding between surgery and our outcomes.
c Patients were enrolled prospectively into a database of primary care visits. The study then retrospectively
reviewed this database, sampling all patients who received bariatric surgery. It is unclear whether mental health
assessments were kept confidential from the surgical team.43
dOnly unadjusted incidences of depression within each arm (surgery vs matched controls) were available.
Additional analyses used multivariable regression to predict time trends in depression after controlling for sex,
age, BMI, and index year through matching as well as group, index year, and time since surgery using
multivariable regression techniques. However, no group × time interaction was presented that would allow for a
comparison of change in depressive symptoms for surgery vs matched controls over time.
e Additional analyses used multivariable regression to predict changes in BDI score after controlling for age, sex,
BMI, anthropometric measures, insulin resistance, and history of medical illness.
f Additional analyses used multivariable regression to predict employment outcomes after controlling for age;
sex; percent total weight loss; history of Axis I disorder, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, or eating disorder; and
change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and SF-36 subscale scores.
g The association between weight loss and depression and anxiety was only assessed via bivariate, unadjusted
analyses. Additional analyses used multivariable regression to predict weight outcomes, but only with variables
that were significant in bivariate analyses (race, baseline BMI, hypertension, and diabetes).
h Analyses of changes in BMI and the incidence of comorbid medical conditions controlled for sex, age, BMI,
income, education, and marital status via a propensity score equation. However, only the comparison of suicide
incidence met our study criteria; this was performed using Fisher exact test without controlling for confounders.
i Additional analyses used multivariable regression to predict changes in the percent estimated weight loss after
controlling for sex, race, age, and surgery type. This analysis, combined all psychiatric disorders and did not
report the impact of individual mental health conditions.
j Multivariable regression was used to control for confounders in evaluating the association between preoperative
mental health conditions and postoperative weight loss. No statistical testing was used to assess changes in the
prevalence of depression over time.

larger improvements in the intervention group.27 The sec-
ond found lower Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
scores at 1 year for both groups of an intervention assessing
preoperative cognitive behavioral therapy.42
Eight prospective14,33,36,39,41,43,44,48 and 2 retrospective
cohort studies25,28 found improvements in depression: 5
reporting on prevalence25,33,41,43,48; 4 on symptoms28,36,39,44;
and 1 on both.14 One large prospective study tracking 3045
bariatric surgery patients in the United Kingdom reported a
reduction in depression prevalence during the first 3 years
after surgery (odds ratio, 0.82 for year 1 [95% CI, 0.78-0.87];
odds ratio, 0.83 for year 2 [95% CI, 0.76-0.90]; and odds
ratio, 0.87 for year 3 [95% CI, 0.78-0.97]).43 However, this
reduction in prevalence did not persist after 3 years. A second
prospective study found a decrease in depression prevalence
from 18% preoperatively to 6% at 2 years.33 A third reported a
decrease in depression prevalence from baseline (45%) to
6 months after surgery (12%) and also to 12 months after sur-
gery (13%). A slight increase was observed between 12 and
24 months but prevalences remained below preoperative
values.48 A fourth study included more than 5500 US
bariatric surgery patients and reported a 49% (95% CI, 41%-
57%) reduction in depression prevalence within 4 months
after surgery; however, this study did not control for
confounders.25 One study of 165 patients participating in a
Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) consor-
tium substudy found no change in the prevalence of depres-
sion over time (7.3% at baseline, 7.1% at 2 years, and 8.5% at
3 years).41
Five studies reported on changes in depressive symp-
toms. The first reported a 63% reduction in self-reported
depressive symptoms at 12 months.44 The second found a
28% to 54% decrease in BDI subscale scores at 12 months.28
The third reported lower mean BDI scores at 1, 2, 3, and 4
years after LABG.36 The fourth reported lower mean BDI
scores at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after LABG but focused on
patients with a BMI of 30 to 40.39 The final study from the
LABS consortium, a high-quality study based on its high
follow-up rates (83% at 6 months, 79% at 1 year) and adjust-
ment for confounders via multivariable regression, found a
reduction in depression incidence and depression symp-
toms at 3-year follow-up. There was no change in hospital-
izations for depression between 0 and 2 years postopera-
tively; however, hospitalization rates increased during the
third year: 0.9% at baseline vs 1.7% in year 3 (P = .03).14 The
clinical significance of this late increase in hospitalization
remains unknown.
All 3 studies reporting on changes in the prevalence or se-
verity of binge eating disorder found improvement 2 years af-
tersurgery.38,39,41However,ratesincreasedslightlywhenmea-
sured at later time points and returned to baseline in 1 of the 2
studies reporting on prevalence.41
Evidence regarding bariatric surgery and alcohol abuse
was mixed. In 1 study, rates of alcohol consumption and
abuse increased significantly during the second year after
surgery, but only for patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass (RYGB) as opposed to laparoscopic adjustable gastric
band (LAGB).29 The Swedish Obese Subjects study, a high-
quality study based on its high follow-up rate (87% at 2
years) and 2 methods of controlling for confounders, found
similar increases in consumption and self-reported alcohol
abuse among vertical-banded gastroplasty patients, but did
not report longitudinal data to determine year-to-year
changes.34 Neither study found a difference in alcohol con-
sumption or abuse among LAGB patients, consistent with a
third study focusing only on LAGB patients.33
Three studies reported on the incidence of suicide after
bariatric surgery. The first found higher rates for patients
undergoing bariatric surgery in Pennsylvania over a 10-year
period (13.7 per 10 000 men and 5.2 per 10 000 women)
than among an age- and sex-matched US population (2.4 per
10 000 men and 0.4 per 10 000 women).30 The second
reported a higher rate of suicide among patients undergoing
RYGB than among matched controls; however, this differ-
ence was not statistically significant (2.6 vs 0.9 per 10 000
person-years, P = .22).3 The third compared patients under-
going RYGB to individuals who sought but did not undergo
bariatric surgery and found no difference in suicide rates
between the groups.37 The 3 studies relied on retrospective
data and none accounted for potential differences in the
prevalence of mental health conditions.
One additional study used administrative data to com-
pare the incidence of self-harm emergencies before and after
bariatric surgery in Ontario, Canada. The authors found an in-
creasedrateofemergencydepartmentvisitsforself-harmpost-
operatively (rate ratio, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.03-2.30]), but none of
these visits resulted in death and the authors were unable to
distinguish suicide attempts from unintentional self-harm
injuries.40
There was no clear evidence regarding postoperative
changes in either bipolar disorder or PTSD. One study
reported no change in the rate of bipolar disorder after
surgery,33 while another found no association between sur-
gery and time to psychiatric hospitalization or the risk-
adjusted use of outpatient psychiatric services for bipolar
disorder.32 The only study on PTSD did not perform statisti-
cal tests.33
The quality of evidence was moderate that bariatric sur-
gery is associated with lower postoperative rates of depres-
sion, fewer symptoms of depression, and decreased usage of
antidepressant therapies, at least during the first 3 years after
surgery. The quality of evidence was very low for all other as-
sociations. Table 4 summarizes the quality of evidence for our
findings.
Discussion
We found moderate-quality evidence that preoperative
mental health conditions are common in patients seeking
and receiving bariatric surgery. Meta-analysis of published
data estimated that 23% of patients undergoing bariatric sur-
gery reported a current mood disorder—most commonly
depression—while 17% were diagnosed with an eating
disorder. Both estimates are higher than published rates for
the general US population, suggesting that special attention

should be paid to these conditions among bariatric
patients.7,8,49-51 Other mental health conditions, such as psy-
chosis, PTSD, and personality disorders are less common but
may be more prominent in select subgroups such as US
veterans.52
We found no clear evidence that preoperative mental
health conditions are associated with differential weight loss
after surgery. Our results are consistent with a previous sys-
tematic review reporting no association between depression,
anxiety, or binge eating disorder and postoperative weight
loss.11 In contrast to that review, we found no evidence sup-
porting an association between personality disorders and poor
weight loss.
We found some evidence to suggest that weight-loss sur-
gery was associated with a reduction in the prevalence, fre-
quency, and severity of depressive symptoms. However, our
study cannot establish a causal relationship and several path-
ways may exist. First, weight loss may improve body image,
self-worth, empowerment, and interpersonal relationships.
Second, changes in digestion or intestinal absorption after sur-
gery may alter the brain’
s biochemical signaling. Third, pa-
tients whose depression may improve on its own may be more
likely to undergo surgery. Although our results should not be
interpreted as indicating that surgery is a treatment for de-
pression,severelyobesepatientswithdepressionmaygainpsy-
chological benefits in addition to the physical benefits al-
ready associated with surgery.53-56
The safety of patients with mental health conditions who
undergo surgery appears to be complex. We found increased
rates of alcohol abuse after surgery—particularly among RYGB
patients—compared with similar populations treated nonop-
eratively. Our results were derived from 3 studies,29,33,34 2 of
which showed increased self-reported alcohol problems after
RYGB29,34; none of the 3 studies found increased rates after
LAGB. These findings are consistent with results from
another systematic review57 and animal studies, which sug-
gest that increased alcohol consumption after RYGB may be
due to physiological changes following intestinal bypass that
are not present after LAGB (eg, postprandial changes to intes-
tinal hormone secretion).58,59 One prospective cohort study
suggested an increased rate of suicide after surgery37 while
another reported increased rates of self-harm emergencies.40
Population-based estimates, including a recent meta-analysis
by Peterhänsel and colleagues,60 also demonstrate above-
average rates of suicide among bariatric surgery patients but
have been unable to disentangle the operation from comor-
bid mental health conditions. Further research is needed to
assess whether bariatric patients are at higher risk for suicide
and alcohol abuse as well as the appropriate mechanisms for
postoperative monitoring in patients with a history of
depression or substance abuse.
Our study has limitations. First, included studies varied
in their use of scales, thresholds, and definitions of out-
comes. The diagnosis of binge eating disorder, for example,
underwent significant redefinition during our search period
and did not exist as a psychiatric disorder until the DSM-5
was released in 2013.61 We report the scale or instrument
used to make a diagnosis; for diagnoses made by interview,
however, it was not always clear what criteria were used.
Second, our results do not address the severity or chronicity
of mental health conditions, which may be independently
associated with postoperative bariatric or mental health
outcomes. Third, bariatric candidates with severe mental ill-
ness are often screened out prior to referral for bariatric sur-
gery and excluded from published studies. Our prevalence
estimates, therefore, are likely to be conservative and our
data on associations specific to patients who are referred to
and considered for surgery. Fourth, our definition for a
meaningful difference in the prevalence of mental health
conditions was arbitrary, but our finding of a 100% increase
in prevalence for several conditions seems to have face
validity. Fifth, our sample size cutoffs were chosen to maxi-
mize the value of information for resources needed and our
analyses suggest that including small, single-institution
studies would not affect our results; however, we cannot
exclude this possibility. Sixth, our results may not general-
ize since the majority of studies reported data from a single
institution and, as a whole, capture the experiences of fewer
than 200 hospitals and outpatient surgery centers perform-
ing bariatric surgery around the world. Seventh, we cannot
exclude the possibility of publication bias.
Guidelines from the American Society for Metabolic and
Bariatric Surgery and the Department of Veterans Affairs/
Department of Defense recommend routine preoperative
health assessments, including a review of patients’mental
health conditions.62,63 Other groups advocate for a more com-
prehensive, preoperative mental health examination in addi-
tion to the general evaluation currently performed by medi-
cal and surgical teams.64,65 The results of our study do not
defend or rebut such a recommendation.
Much of the difficulty in determining the effectiveness
of preoperative mental health screening is due to the limita-
tions of current screening strategies, which use a variety of
scales and focus on mental health diagnoses rather than psy-
chosocial factors. Previous reviews have suggested that self-
esteem, mental image, cognitive function, temperament,
support networks, and socioeconomic stability play major
roles in determining outcomes after bariatric surgery.10,66
Future studies would benefit from including these charac-
teristics as well as having clear eligibility criteria, standard-
ized instruments, regular measurement intervals, and trans-
parency with respect to time-specific follow-up rates. By
addressing these methodological issues, future work can
help to identify the optimal strategy for evaluating patients’
mental health prior to bariatric surgery.
Conclusions
Mental health conditions are common among patients seek-
ing and undergoing bariatric surgery, particularly depression
and binge eating disorder. There is inconsistent evidence re-
garding the association between preoperative mental health
conditions and postoperative weight loss. Moderate-quality
