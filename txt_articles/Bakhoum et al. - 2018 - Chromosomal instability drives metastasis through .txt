Abstract: Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of cancer that results from ongoing errors in chromosome
segregation during mitosis. Although chromosomal instability is a major driver of tumour evolution, its
role in metastasis has not been established. Here we show that chromosomal instability promotes metasta-
sis by sustaining a tumour cell-autonomous response to cytosolic DNA. Errors in chromosome segregation
create a preponderance of micronuclei whose rupture spills genomic DNA into the cytosol. This leads to
the activation of the cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes) cytosolic
DNA-sensing pathway and downstream noncanonical NF-￿B signalling. Genetic suppression of chromoso-
mal instability markedly delays metastasis even in highly aneuploid tumour models, whereas continuous
chromosome segregation errors promote cellular invasion and metastasis in a STING-dependent manner.
By subverting lethal epithelial responses to cytosolic DNA, chromosomally unstable tumour cells co-opt
chronic activation of innate immune pathways to spread to distant organs.

Chromosomal instability (CIN) correlates with tumour metastasis1,2, 
but it remains unclear whether it is a mere bystander or a driver of 
metastatic progression. Chromosomally unstable cells show evidence of 
chromosome missegregation during anaphase3,4, offering an attractive 
bottleneck in which to target CIN and probe its selective contribution 
to metastasis. Destabilization of microtubule attachments to chromo-
somes at the kinetochores, through overexpression of the non-motile 
microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin-13 family proteins KIF2B or 
KIF2C (also known as MCAK), directly suppresses CIN in otherwise 
chromosomally unstable cells5–7. Cells overexpressing KIF2B or MCAK 
continue to propagate abnormal aneuploid karyotypes, albeit in a stable 
manner7. As such, this approach permits direct experimental interro-
gation of CIN, as defined by the rate of ongoing chromosome misseg-
regation, independently of aneuploidy, which is defined as a state of 
abnormal chromosome numbers.
Increased CIN in human metastases
First, to determine whether CIN is associated with human metastases, 
we applied the weighted-genomic integrity index (wGII) as a proxy 
for CIN8 to 79 matched pairs of primary tumour and brain meta-
stasis from a published cohort9. Metastases showed higher wGII than 
 
primary tumours (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a, b).
Next, karyotype analysis of primary breast tumours and metastases 
archived in the Mitelman Database of chromosomal translocations10 
revealed a predilection for near-diploid (2n) karyotypes in primary 
tumours. Conversely, metastases were enriched for cells with near- 
triploid (3n) karyotypes and had twice as many structural or numerical 
chromosomal aberrations per clone as primary tumours. The number 
of chromosomal aberrations was highest in tumour samples with karyo-
types ranging between the diploid and tetraploid (4n) range (Fig. 1b, c 
 
and Extended Data Fig. 1c, d).
Finally, histological analysis of primary tumours from patients with 
locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma11 revealed 
a significant association (P < 
 0.05) between anaphase chromosome 
missegregation and the incidence of lymph node metastasis (Fig. 1d 
and Extended Data Fig. 1e).
CIN is a driver of metastasis
To determine whether CIN is causally involved in metastasis, we used 
transplantable metastatic tumour models of human (MDA-MB-231) or 
mouse (4T1) triple-negative breast cancer and human lung adenocarci-
noma (H2030), in which 47%, 55%, and 67% of anaphase cells, respec-
tively, show evidence of chromosome missegregation. Overexpression 
of KIF2B or MCAK suppressed chromosome missegregation, whereas 
overexpression of a dominant-negative MCAK mutant12 (dnMCAK) led 
to a modest increase in chromosome missegregation in MDA-MB-231 
cells. Overexpression of KIF2B or MCAK did not alter cellular prolife-
ration or the number of centrosomes per cell (Fig. 2a, b and Extended 
Data Fig. 1f–i). As a control, we overexpressed KIF2A, a third mem-
ber of the kinesin-13 family that lacks kinetochore and centromere 
 
localization domains13; although KIF2A showed microtubule- 
depolymerizing activity on interphase microtubules, it had no observ-
able effect on CIN (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 1i–k). We ruled out 
a direct role for kinesin-13-mediated microtubule depolymerization in 
Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of cancer that results from ongoing errors in chromosome segregation during 
mitosis. Although chromosomal instability is a major driver of tumour evolution, its role in metastasis has not been 
established. Here we show that chromosomal instability promotes metastasis by sustaining a tumour cell-autonomous 
response to cytosolic DNA. Errors in chromosome segregation create a preponderance of micronuclei whose rupture spills 
genomic DNA into the cytosol. This leads to the activation of the cGAS–STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of 
interferon genes) cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and downstream noncanonical NF-κB signalling. Genetic suppression 
of chromosomal instability markedly delays metastasis even in highly aneuploid tumour models, whereas continuous 
chromosome segregation errors promote cellular invasion and metastasis in a STING-dependent manner. By subverting 
lethal epithelial responses to cytosolic DNA, chromosomally unstable tumour cells co-opt chronic activation of innate 
immune pathways to spread to distant organs.

activating small GTPases14 by performing RhoA and Rac1 pull-down 
assays, which revealed low basal levels of activity and no correlation 
with overexpression of kinesin-13 family proteins (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 2a, b). Hereafter, we refer to cells expressing MCAK or KIF2B as 
CIN-low and to control cells or those expressing KIF2A or dnMCAK 
as CIN-high.
Karyotyping of the parental MDA-MB-231 cells revealed a widely 
aneuploid (approximately 3n) chromosome content with widespread 
karyotypic heterogeneity (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Suppression of CIN 
reduced both numerical and structural karyotypic heterogeneity in 
 
single-cell-derived clones, as supported by the presence of fewer 
chromo 
somes exhibiting non-clonal structural abnormalities and 
decreased numerical chromosome heterogeneity in CIN-low cells 
(Extended Data Fig. 2c–h). Notably, CIN-low cells maintained highly 
aneuploid karyotypes, but faithfully propagated them in a stable manner. 
 
Thus, by comparing chromosomally stable aneuploid cells to their 
chromo 
somally unstable aneuploid counterparts, we can experimen-
tally examine the role of CIN, independent of aneuploidy, in metastasis.
We injected MDA-MB-231 cells into the left cardiac ventricles 
of athymic mice to enable systemic dissemination while tracking 
 
metastatic colonization using a bioluminescence reporter. Differences in 
chromosome missegregation rates had a marked effect on colonization: 
 
mice harbouring CIN-high cells rapidly succumbed to metastatic 
 
disease, with a median survival of 70 days, whereas mice injected with 
CIN-low cells had a lower metastatic burden and a median survival of 
207 days. Many metastases from CIN-low cells waxed and waned and, 
at times, spontaneously resolved, whereas metastases from CIN-high 
cells involved multiple organs and progressed rapidly, leading to death. 
Similar results were obtained after injection of lung adenocarcinoma 
H2030 cells (Fig. 2c–e and Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). Overexpression of 
the spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2 in MCAK-expressing 
cells partially rescued chromosome missegregation15 and correspond-
ingly augmented metastasis (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3f).
We performed orthotopic injections of MDA-MB-231 or 4T1 cells 
into the mammary fat pads of athymic or immune-competent BALB/c 
mice, respectively, followed by surgical excision of the primary tumour. 
Suppression of CIN had no effect on the efficiency of primary tumour 
implantation, and even enhanced primary tumour growth in the 4T1 
model. However, in both models, suppression of CIN significantly 
reduced spontaneous metastasis and prolonged survival (Extended 
Data Fig. 3d, e).
We then assessed chromosome missegregation in the injected cells 
and in cells derived from primary tumours and metastatic colonies 
(Fig. 3a). We performed this analysis using MDA-MB-231 cells and 
two metastasis-competent xenografts (PDX) derived from patients with 
oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+ 
) and triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC). Regardless of the CIN status of the injected cells, the majority 
of metastases were enriched for higher rates of chromosome missegre-
gation, whereas cells derived from most primary tumours had signifi-
cantly lower rates of CIN (Fig. 3b–d). For instance, when CIN-high cells 
(Fig. 3d, dnMCAK, blue bars) were injected into the mammary fat pad, 
chromosome missegregation rates decreased in the primary tumours 
(green bars) before increasing once more in metastases spontaneously 
arising within the same animal (orange bars).

CIN enriches for mesenchymal traits
Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identified 1,584 genes that were 
 
differentially expressed between CIN-low and CIN-high MDA-MB-231 
cells. Principal component analysis and unsupervised clustering accu-
rately separated samples according to their CIN status. Metastasis-
related and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene sets were 
relatively enriched in CIN-high cells. The top 23 differentially expressed 
genes in CIN-high cells (referred to as CIN signature) predicted distant 
 
metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in a meta-analysis16 as well as a 
 
validation cohort17 of patients with breast cancer, irrespective of 
tumour subtype, grade, or lymph node status (Extended Data Figs 4, 5).
RNA-seq of primary tumour-derived and metastasis-derived cells 
revealed pathways that were shared among metastases and CIN-high 
cells. However, metastases contained a large number of differentially 
upregulated EMT and inflammation-related genes that were dispro-
portionately clustered on chromosome 1, signifying chromosome 1 
-specific selection. Karyotype analysis revealed that the injected cell 
lines and most metastases had three copies of chromosome 1, whereas 
primary tumours consistently had two copies. Thus chromosome 1 
 
loss is a recurrent event during primary tumour growth in this model 
(Extended Data Figs 4c–f, 5a–e).
We then performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on three 
MDA-MB-231 cell lines—two CIN-low (KIF2B and MCAK) and one 
CIN-high (dnMCAK)—comprising a total of 6,821 cells. Clustering of 
single cells using EMT genes successfully classified most cells according 
to their CIN-status and revealed a fraction of cells (primarily CIN-high) 
that was highly enriched in mesenchymal markers (Fig. 4a). Unsupervised 
graph-based clustering, based on all expressed genes, identified 12 pheno-
typically distinct subpopulations. One subpopulation was defined by 
increased expression of genes involved in EMT and metastasis (referred to 
as subpopulation ‘M’) and was concomitantly enriched for CIN signature 
genes. This sub 
population comprised 45% of dnMCAK expressing cells 
compared to 6% of CIN-low cells (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 6a, b).
In agreement with the scRNA-seq data, CIN-high cells exhibited 
increased migratory and invasive behaviour in vitro, and displayed 
evidence of actin cytoskeletal reorganization, diffuse vimentin 
staining, and increased cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of 
 
β-catenin (Extended Data Figs 6c, d, 7a–d). As expected, MAD2 over-
expression rescued invasion and migration of MCAK-expressing cells. 
Furthermore, the ability of KIF2B or MCAK overexpression to suppress 
invasion in vitro was dependent on the cell cycle, as the addition of 
thymidine after transient transfection of either protein abrogated this 
phenotype (Extended Data Figs 6f, 7e, f and Supplementary Fig. 2).
CIN generates cytosolic DNA
To better define CIN-responsive pathways, we performed a gene–gene 
Pearson correlation analysis using scRNA-seq data and identified two 
large gene modules: module 1 was characterized by proliferative and 
metabolic pathways, whereas module 2 comprised EMT and inflamma-
tion gene sets (Fig. 5a). There was a strong positive correlation between 
inflammation-related, CIN signature, and EMT genes in the scRNA-seq 
and bulk RNA-seq data (Figs 4b, 5b and Extended Data Fig. 4b, c).

The induction of inflammatory pathways in response to CIN was 
unexpected and was reminiscent of a viral infection. We investi-
gated whether CIN might introduce genomic DNA into the cytosol, 
thereby eliciting cellular responses normally reserved for anti-viral 
 
immunity18,19. The exposure of genomic DNA to the cytosol can result 
from either primary nuclear or micronuclear envelope ruptures20–24. 
We performed live-cell imaging using a GFP reporter with a nuclear 
localization signal (NLS–GFP)25 and found no correlation between 
CIN and the frequency of NLS–GFP leakage into the cytosol in 
unconfined conditions. There was even a trend towards more efficient 
primary nucleus repair in CIN-high cells. CIN-high nuclei ruptured 
more frequently only during confined migration, and this was primarily 
 
attributed to their increased ability to go through a larger number of 
small constrictions (Extended Data Fig. 7g–j) that mimic confined 
migration during metastasis25.
Instead, CIN-high cells and those derived from metastases exhibited 
 
a higher preponderance of micronuclei than did CIN-low or primary 
tumour-derived cells, respectively (Fig. 5c–e and Extended Data 
 
Fig. 8a–c). To test whether the presence of rupture-prone20 micronuclei 
correlated with increased cytosolic DNA, we stained cells using two dif-
ferent anti-dsDNA antibodies after selective plasma membrane perme-
abilization and found increased cytosolic dsDNA and single-stranded 
DNA (ssDNA) in CIN-high cells. The dsDNA signal, which was distinct 
from mitochondrial staining, disappeared after treatment with double- 
strand-specific—but not single-strand-specific—nuclease and after 
overexpression of DNASE2, confirming the specificity of these anti-
bodies (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 8d–h). Quantification of dsDNA 
levels after subcellular fractionation revealed a fourfold reduction in 
cytosolic DNA in CIN-low cells compared to CIN-high cells (Fig. 5g). 
Whole-genome sequencing of subcellular fractions at 30× 
 coverage 
confirmed the genomic origin of cytosolic DNA (data not shown).
To determine whether missegregated chromosomes provide a 
source of cytosolic DNA, we used an inducible Y-chromosome-
specific missegregation system established in chromosomally stable 
DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells26. Whole-chromosome fluorescence 
in situ hybridization (FISH) probes targeting the Y chromosome 
or an independent autosome (chromosome 15) revealed selective 
 
incorporation of the Y chromosome into micronuclei two days after 
chromosome missegregation induced by doxycycline and auxin 
 
(Dox/IAA) treatment. Notably, Y-chromosome-specific fragments 
were found dispersed within the cytosol 2–3 days after Dox/IAA addi-
tion, whereas the control autosome remained confined to the nucleus 
 
(Fig. 5h), demonstrating that cytosolic DNA is generated from 
 
chromosomes undergoing high rates of missegregation
Suppression of micronuclear envelope rupture by mCherry–lamin 
B2 overexpression20 reduced cytosolic dsDNA staining without influ-
encing chromosome segregation errors. Accordingly, such overex-
pression reduced metastasis after intracardiac or tail vein injection of 
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5i and Extended Data Fig. 3g, h).
Metastasis from cytosolic DNA response
In chromosomally stable cells, cytosolic dsDNA is scarce and is 
sensed by the cGAS–STING pathway19, leading to induction of type 
I interferon stimulated genes (ISGs)22,23,27. Indeed, induced mis-
segregation of the Y chromosome led to the upregulation of OAS2, 
an ISG, and increased interferon-β 
 production by DLD-1 cells

(Extended Data Fig. 9f, g). It is unclear how chromosomally unstable 
 
cancer cells cope with the constant presence of cytosolic DNA. We 
found notable localization of cGAS to approximately half of all 
micronuclei, as previously observed22,23,27. Impeding micronuclear 
rupture through lamin B2 overexpression20 significantly diminished 
the relative fraction of cGAS+ micronuclei (Fig. 6a, b). Furthermore, 
CIN-high cells exhibited increased levels and perinuclear localization 
 
of STING, congruent with pathway activation (Fig. 6c).
Notably, there was no evidence for robust activation of downstream 
canonical NF-κ 
B or type I interferon signalling in CIN-high cells, 
 
as evidenced by the lack of a significant increase in p65 or IRF3 
 
phosphorylation, absence of p65 or IRF3 nuclear translocation, unde-
tectable levels of interferon-β 
, and failure to induce ISGs (Extended Data 
 
Figs 8i, j, 9), in line with previous observations28–30.
Cytosolic DNA, however, can activate the noncanonical NF-κ 
B 
pathway in a STING-dependent and TBK1-independent manner18. 
We found evidence for noncanonical NF-κ 
B activation in CIN-high 
cells, as revealed by lower levels of the precursor protein p100, a trend 
towards higher ratios of p52 and phosphorylated p100 relative to total 
p100, and reduced levels of the noncanonical NF-κ 
B pathway inhibitor 
TRAF231 (Extended Data Fig. 8i, j). Given the subtle differences seen 
at the protein level, we assessed the nuclear localization of RELB, the 
binding partner of p52, and observed increased nuclear localization 
in CIN-high cells. This was often accompanied by cytosolic staining, 
indicative of chronic pathway activation. STING depletion reduced 
nuclear localization of RELB and led to downregulation of EMT and 
inflammatory pathways, whereas the addition of cGAMP or over-
expression of MAD2 increased nuclear RELB in MCAK-expressing 
cells (Fig. 6d, Extended Data Figs 4e, 9c–e).
Bulk RNA-seq data identified a number of noncanonical NF-κ 
B 
 
target genes that were upregulated in response to CIN (CIN-responsive 
NC-NF-κ 
B genes). There was a robust correlation between the CIN 
signature, STING, and the CIN-responsive NC-NF-κ 
B genes in 
 
scRNA-seq data, in contrast to a weaker correlation between CIN and 
type I interferon targets (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 6e). Similarly, 
RNA-seq data from primary breast cancer in the TCGA database 
demonstrated increased expression of CIN-responsive NC-NF-κ 
B 
genes in tumours with higher levels of CIN signature gene products 
(Fig. 6e), and higher expression of key regulators of the noncanonical 
NF-κ 
B pathway or its CIN-responsive target genes was associated with 
shorter DMFS and disease-free survival in breast and lung cancers. 
Conversely, increased expression of canonical NF-κ 
B or type I inter-
feron regulatory factors was associated with an improved prognosis 
(Extended Data Fig. 10a).
cGAS activation by cancer cells has been invoked in brain metastasis 
through a tumour cell-non-autonomous mechanism32. We found that 
STING and downstream noncanonical NF-κ 
B activity mediate meta-
stasis in a tumour cell-autonomous fashion, as evidenced by reduction 
 
in metastatic dissemination, lifespan extension, and reduction in 
 
in vitro and in vivo invasion of CIN-high cells depleted of STING, 
RELB, or p100 (encoded by NFKB2). Conversely, the addition of 
cGAMP increased invasion and migration of CIN-low cells (Fig. 6f, g 
 
and Extended Data Figs 6f, 9j, 10b–d). These findings are in line 
with reported roles for the noncanonical NF-κ 
B pathway in EMT, 
cellular invasion, and metastasis33–35. The benefits of the noncano-
nical pathway may justify the scarcity of inactivating mutations in 
cGAS and STING among breast and lung cancers (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 10e).
Discussion
Our work reveals an unexpected link between CIN, chronic activa-
tion of cytosolic DNA sensing pathways, and metastasis. In addition to 
fuelling karyotypic heterogeneity that serves as a substrate for natural 
selection, ongoing chromosome missegregation is required to replenish 
cytosolic DNA pools and to maintain cells in a pro-metastatic state. 
Consequently, suppression of CIN reduces metastasis even in highly 
aneuploid cells. The repercussions of STING activation are context- 
dependent and range from senescence to tumorigenesis21–23,27,28,30.

Given that chromosomally unstable cells are awash with cytosolic DNA, 
our results raise the possibility that by suppressing downstream type I 
interferon signalling30 and instead upregulating the alternative NF-κ 
B 
 
pathway, such cells have substituted a lethal epithelial response to 
inflammation with that of myeloid-derived cells36,37, thereby engaging 
in some form of immune mimicry. Restoration of normal responses to 
inflammation would constitute a viable therapeutic strategy to target 
chromosomally unstable cells.
The emergence, and subsequent tolerance, of CIN represents an 
important bottleneck during tumour evolution38–40. We found that CIN 
induces a transcriptional shift from a proliferative and highly metabolic 
state, ideally suited for primary tumour growth, to a mesenchymal state 
associated with upregulation of inflammatory pathways (Figs 4b, 5a). 
These two mutually exclusive states, which were recently observed in 
a pan-cancer genomic analysis of metastatic tumours41, are likely to 
account for the reversibility in chromosome missegregation rates seen 
in primary tumours and metastases, and provide an explanation for the 
negative effect of aneuploidy during early tumorigenesis38,40,42. These 
findings also lead us to suggest that CIN drives the subset of human 
metastases characterized by EMT and inflammation41.

Genomic analysis of primary tumour–metastasis matched pairs. Whole-exome 
DNA sequence data from 79 brain metastases with matched primary tumour and 
normal tissue9 were downloaded from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes 
(dbGAP) and processed as described43 to derive allele-specific segmented DNA 
copy number data for each sample. The weighted genome instability index (wGII), 
which describes the proportion of the genome that was classified as aberrant 
 
relative to tumour ploidy, was determined as described8.
Mitelman database analysis. All available breast adenocarcinoma cases in 
 
the Mitelman database10 were analysed. The primary literature was reviewed to 
determine the source of the sample (primary tumour or metastasis). When clonal 
karyotype was reported as a range, the average value was used for that given clone. 
Karyotype aberrations included structural aberrations as well as numerical devi-
ations from the overall karyotype of the clone.
Analysis of chromosome segregation in head and neck squamous cell 
 
carcinoma. We analysed primary tumour specimens from 60 patients with head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)11. Haematoxylin and eosin-stained 
primary tumour samples of sufficient quality for high-resolution microscopy 
 
analysis were available for forty patients. Analysis was restricted to cells fixed while 
undergoing anaphase, as previously described44,45. Chromosome missegregation 
was defined by the presence of haematoxylin staining between the remaining 
 
segregating chromosomes during anaphase and was reported as the percentage of 
cells undergoing anaphase with evidence of chromosome missegregation, as pre-
viously described44. Clinical lymph node status was defined on the basis of clinical 
 
examination or radiographic evidence of lymph node tumour involvement11.
Single-cell karyotyping. Cultures were treated with colcemid at a final concen-
tration of 0.1 μ 
g ml−1. Following 45 min incubation at 37 °C, the cultures were 
trypsinized, resuspended in pre-warmed 0.075 M KCl, incubated for an additional 
10 min at 37 °C and fixed in methanol:acetic acid (3:1). The fixed cell suspension 
was then dropped onto slides, stained in 0.08 μ 
g ml−1 DAPI in 2× 
SSC for 5 min 
and mounted in antifade solution (Vectashield, Vector Labs). Metaphase spreads 
were captured using a Nikon Eclipse E800 epifluorescence microscope equipped 
with GenASI Cytogenetic suite (Applied Spectral Imaging). For each sample a 
minimum of 20 inverted DAPI-stained metaphases were fully karyotyped and 
 
analysed according to the International System of Human Cytogenetic 
Nomenclature (ISCN) 2013.
FISH analysis. FISH analysis was performed on fixed cells prepared for single- 
cell karyotyping. Based on karyotype data, four chromosomes were selected to 
 
further evaluate numerical instability. Probes specific for centromere 3 (red), 
 
centromere 4 (orange) and centromere 9 (green) were purchased form Abbott-
Vysis. The chromosome 6 centromeric probe was home-brew (PAC clone P308; 
labelled with green dUTP, MSKCC Molecular Cytogenetics Core Facility). Probe 
labelling, hybridization, post-hybridization washing, and fluorescence detection 
were performed according to standard laboratory procedures26. For each probe, 
three normal peripheral blood samples (GM07535, GM06875 and GM00558), 
obtained from Coriell Institute, were also analysed to derive cut-off values 
 
(false positive).
RHOA and RAC1 pull-down assays. The activity of RHOA and RAC1 was deter-
mined using bead-based pull-down assay kits (Cytoskeleton, RHOA: BK036S, 
RAC1: BK035S). Cells were lysed on the tissue culture dish and rapidly snap frozen 
 
for storage until further processing. cGAMP was added for 18 h before lysis. In 
addition to His-tagged RHOA and RAC1, the positive and negative controls were 
total cell lysates supplemented with non-hydrolysable GTP or GDP, respectively.
Cell culture. Cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection 
(ATCC). Tumour (MDA-MB-231, 4T1, HEK293, and H2030), cells were cultured 
in DMEM or RPMI (4T1) supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM l-glutamine 
in the presence of penicillin (50 U ml−1) and streptomycin (50 μ 
g ml−1). All cells 
tested negative for mycoplasma. Cell confluence was measured using IncuCyte 
live-cell analysis system (Essen Bioscience).
Immunofluorescence microscopy. Cell fixation and antibody staining were 
performed as previously described7. In brief, cells were fixed with ice-cold 
 
(− 
30 °C) methanol for 15 min (when staining for centromeres, centrosomes, cGAS, 
Vimentin, β 
-actin, IRF3, or α 
-tubulin) or 4% paraformaldehyde (when staining 
for RELB, p65, STING, ssDNA, dsDNA, COXIV, or β 
-catenin). Subsequently, 
cells were permeabilized using 1% triton for 4 min. See Supplementary Table 1 
for antibody information. For selective plasma membrane permeabilization used 
 
for cytosolic dsDNA and ssDNA staining, cells were treated with 0.02% saponin for 
5 min after fixation. For single-stranded (Thermo Fisher Scientific, FEREN0321) 
and double stranded (Life Technologies, EN0771)-specific nuclease treatment, cells 
were also permeabilized with 0.02% saponin for 2 min and treated with either nucle-
ase for 10 min before fixation using 4% paraformaldehyde. TBS–BSA was used as a 
blocking agent during antibody staining. DAPI was added together with secondary 
 
antibodies. Cells were mounted with Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Life 
Technologies, P36961). cGAMP (Invivogen, tlrl-nacga23) was transfected into cells 
at a concentration of 4 μ 
g ml−1 using lipofectamine 2000 that was added for 3–4 h 
and then replaced with regular serum-containing medium.
Immunoblotting. Cells were pelleted and lysed using RIPA buffer. Protein 
concentration was determined using BCA protein assay and 20–30 μ 
g total pro-
tein was loaded in each lane. Proteins were separated by gradient SDS–PAGE 
and transferred to PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes. Full blots are shown in 
Supplementary Fig. 1. See Supplementary Table 2 for antibody information. Band 
intensities on immunoblots were obtained using ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) 
or the LI-COR Odyssey software, normalized to loading control, and background 
was subtracted. Ratios were normalized to control cells. Interferon-β 
 levels from 
conditioned medium were measured using the Human IFN beta Array 1-plex 
 
(Eve Technologies, HIFNB-01-31).
Y chromosome missegregation and FISH. Flp-In T-REx DLD-1 cells were engi-
neered to express the TIR1 auxin-dependent plant E3 ligase, an auxin-inducible 
degron (AID)-tagged CENP-A modified at the endogenous allele (CENP-AAID/–), 
and a doxycycline-inducible CENP-AC–H3 rescue gene integrated into the Flp-In 
locus as previously described26. Cells (4.0 × 
 104) were seeded into 4-well chamber 
slides and treated with doxycycline (DOX, Sigma-Aldrich) and indole-3-acetic acid 
(IAA, Sigma-Aldrich) for up to 3 days to induce Y chromosome missegregation 
and micronuclei. Slides were washed in PBS, fixed in 3:1 methanol:acetic acid for 
15 min at room temperature, and dehydrated with 80% ethanol. Chromosome paint 
FISH probes targeting chromosomes Y and 15 (MetaSystems) were mixed at equal 
ratios, applied to cells, sealed with a coverslip, and co-denatured at 75 °C for 2 min 
 
followed by overnight hybridization at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Slides were 
washed in 0.4× saline–sodium citrate (SSC) buffer for 2 min at 72 °C, followed by 
a 30 s wash in 2× 
 SCC, 0.05% Tween-20 buffer at room temperature. Cells were 
counterstained with DAPI and captured on a DeltaVision Elite (GE Healthcare) 
microscope system at 60× 
 magnification (25 × 
 0.2 μ 
m z-stacks) followed by image 
deconvolution and maximum intensity quick projection.
Knockdown and overexpression constructs. Luciferase expression was achieved 
using pLVX plasmid (expressing tdTomato) and cells stably expressing luciferase 
were selected using hygromycin and sorted for tdTomato expression. Kinesin-13 
family protein expression was achieved using plasmid (pEGFP) transfection or 
lentiviral (pLenti-GIII-CMV-GFP-2A-Puro) expression where cells were selected 
using G418 (0.5 mg ml−1) or puromycin (5 μ 
g ml−1), respectively. DNASE2 
overexpression was achieved using a pLenti-GIII-CMV-RFP-2A-Puro plasmid 
with puromycin used for selection. Plasmids containing kinesin-13 proteins or 
lamin B2 (pQCXIB–mCherry–lmnb2) constructs were offered by the Compton 
and Hetzer Laboratories, respectively. Blasticidin was used to select for lmnb2- 
expressing cells at 10 μ 
g ml−1. All other plasmids were purchased from Applied 
Biological Materials (https://www.abmgood.com/). Stable knockdown of STING, 
NFKB2, RELB, and cGAS were achieved using shRNAs in pRRL (SGEP or 
SGEN) plasmids obtained from the MSKCC RNA Interference Core. Two to four 
 
distinct shRNA hairpins were screened per target. Targeted shRNA sequences are 
listed in Supplementary Table 3. To visualize primary nuclear rupture, cells were 
stably modified with a retroviral construct expressing both NLS–GFP25 and H2B–
Tdtomato (3× 
NLScopGFP-P2A-H2BtdTomato-IRES-puromycin). Cells were cul-
tured for 24 h after viral transduction before selection with 1 μ 
g ml−1 puromycin 
and subsequently sorted to select for NLS–GFP and H2B–TdTomato expression.
Cell migration in microfluidic devices. Microfluidic migration devices with pre-
cisely defined constrictions were prepared as described previously25,46. Devices 
were coated with 50 μ 
g ml−1 type-I rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences) in 0.02 M 
acetic acid overnight at 4 °C. Approximately 80,000 cells were seeded (in DMEM 
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PenStrep) per migration chamber. Devices 
were placed in a tissue-culture incubator (37 °C) for 5–6 h to allow the cells to 
adhere. Subsequently, the medium was changed to phenol-red free Leibovitz 
L15 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PenStrep before the device 
was mounted on an inverted microscope (Zeiss Observer Z1) equipped with a 
 
temperature-controlled stage (37 °C) for live-cell imaging. The medium reservoirs 
of the device were covered with glass coverslips to minimize evaporation during 
live-cell imaging. Cells were imaged for 14–16 h at 10-min intervals with a CCD 
camera (Photometrics CoolSNAP KINO) using a Zeiss 20× 
/NA 0.8 air objective. 
Acquired image sequences were analysed for nuclear rupture frequency, duration, 
and transit time of cells through 1 × 5-μ 
m2, 2 × 5-μ 
m2, and 15 × 5-μ 
m2 constric-
tions using Zen software (Zeiss) and a custom-written MATLAB 2016a script for 
automated image analysis.
Animal studies. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with proto-
cols approved by the Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee. For disease-specific survival in MDA-MB-231 experiments, power 
analysis indicated that ten mice per group would be sufficient to detect a difference

at relative hazard ratios of < 
0.2 or > 
5 with 80% power and 95% confidence, given a 
median disease-specific survival of 3 months in the control group and a total follow 
up period of 250 days. For the 4T1 experiments, power analysis indicated that ten 
mice per group would be sufficient to detect a difference at relative hazard ratios 
of < 
0.25 or > 
4.0 with 80% power and 95% confidence, given a median survival 
of 58 days in the control group and a total follow up period of 180 days. There was 
no need to randomize animals. Investigators were not blinded to group allocation. 
Intracardiac injection was performed as previously described32. In brief, cells were 
trypsinized and washed with PBS and 1 × 
 105 cells (in 100 μ 
l PBS) were injected 
into the left cardiac ventricle of female athymic 6–7-week-old athymic nude 
(nu/nu) mice (Jackson Laboratory strain 002019). Cells (2 × 
 105) were injected 
into the tail vein cohort of animals. Mice were then immediately injected with 
d-luciferin (150 mg kg−1) and subjected to bioluminescence imaging (BLI) using 
tan IVIS Spectrum Xenogen instrument (Caliper Life Sciences) to ensure sys-
temic dissemination of tumour cells. Metastatic burden was measured 5–7 weeks 
after injection using BLI. BLI images were analysed using Living Image Software 
v.2.50. Disease-specific survival endpoint was met when the mice died or met the 
criteria for euthanasia under the IACUC protocol and had radiographic evidence 
of metastatic disease. For orthotopic tumour implantation, 2.5 × 105 cells in 50 μ 
l 
PBS were mixed 1:1 with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected into the fourth 
mammary fat pad. Only one tumour was implanted per animal. MDA-MB-231 
primary tumours were surgically excised before they reached ~ 
1.5 cm in the largest 
dimension (which was the maximum allowable under our IACUC protocol) and 
metastatic dissemination was assessed using BLI imaging at 1–3-week intervals for 
up to 30 weeks. The distant metastasis-free survival endpoint was met when BLI 
signal was seen outside the site of primary tumour transplantation. 4T1 tumours 
were excised 8–9 days after implantation. To derive short-term culture from pri-
mary tumours and metastases, anesthetized mice (isofluorane) were imaged then 
killed. Ex vivo BLI was subsequently performed on removed organs to define the 
precise location of the metastatic lesion. Primary tumours and metastases were 
subsequently mechanically dissociated and cultured in DMEM with selection 
medium (G418 or hygromycin) to select for tumour cells and exclude host cells. All 
subsequent assays (karyotyping, RNA-seq, immunofluorescence, and subcellular 
fractionation) were performed after a single passage from the primary sample. To 
assess chromosome missegregation from primary tumour-derived and metastasis- 
derived cells, we performed high-resolution immunofluorescence analysis on 
 
passage no. 1 cells, staining for DNA (DAPI) and centromeres (ACA). The presence 
of cells with DNA or centromere staining in the middle of the anaphase plate was 
taken as evidence of chromosome missegregation.
Patient-derived xenograft assays. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of 
human metastatic breast cancers were generated by transplanting the freshly 
obtained surgically excised tumour specimens from patients who had given 
 
consent under the IRB approved protocol (MSKCC IRB #97-094) in female 
 
NOD/SCID/IL2Rγnull (NSG) mice (Jackson Laboratories strain 005557). All rele-
vant ethical regulations were followed. The oestrogen receptor-positive PDX was 
derived from breast cancer metastatic to the bone. The TNBC PDX was estab-
lished from an axillary lymph node metastasis from a patient with inflammatory 
breast cancer. PDXs were maintained for a maximum of three serial passages. In 
brief, freshly obtained tumour tissue specimens were either directly transplanted 
in the mammary fat-pad of the mice or minced into 1–2-mm pieces in serum-free 
MEM medium with nonessential amino acids (Cat. No. 41500018, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing either GFP–luciferase or 
pUltra-Chili–Luc plasmid (Addgene plasmid: 48688) followed by transplantation 
into mice. Typically PDX tumour growth became evident during the first 1–3 
weeks after engrafting and tumours continued to grow for an additional 4–8 weeks. 
Primary tumour growth and metastases were followed using BLI or spectrum CT 
imaging. At the time of removal of primary tumours and metastases, we derived 
primary cell cultures directly from primary tumours as well as lung and liver metas-
tases. In brief, 500 mg of fresh bulk tumour tissue was chopped into 1–2-mm3 
pieces and incubated in Accutase (AT104; Innovative Cell Technologies) for cell 
detachment and separation over 1–2 h. The dissociated tissues were sieved through 
100-μ 
m cell strainers and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,200 r.p.m. 
The pellets were washed and resuspended in the above MEM buffer with 3% FBS. 
Cells were analysed for chromosome missegregation after one passage.
RNA sequencing and analysis. Bulk RNA was extracted from cells using the 
QIAShredder (Qiagen, 79654) and the RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, 74106) and 
sequenced using HiSeq2500 or HiSeq4000 (Illumina). The quality of the raw 
FASTQ files were checked with FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.
ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). For samples originating from mouse xenografts, FASTQ 
reads were classified as originating from either mouse (GRCm38) or human 
(GRCh38) genomes using xenome47, and human-specific reads were used for 
 
mapping. Reads were mapped to human reference GRCh38 using STAR (v2.4.1d, 
2-pass mode)48. Gene expression was estimated using cufflinks (v2.2.1, default 
parameters) and HTSeq (v0.6.1)49,50. Differential expression analyses were 
 
performed using DESeq2 (v1.14.1)51. Pre-ranked gene set enrichment analyses were 
performed on the DESeq2 log2 fold changes52. Prior to any unsupervised analyses, 
 
expression counts were transformed using variance stabilizing transformation 
using the DESeq2 R package. Gene signatures used in the study are listed in 
Supplementary Table 5. Differentially expressed gene sets and their associated statis-
tics are listed in Supplementary Table 6. To detect potential copy number changes, 
positional gene enrichment analysis (PGE) was performed on the up 
regulated 
 
and downregulated differentially expressed genes, separately (padj ≤ 0.1)53. Only 
significant regions with four or more genes and with P ≤ 
 0.01 were kept for further 
analysis. Circos plots were made using the circlize R package54.
Reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cells were 
collected into trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and total RNA was 
extracted using ‘Pureling RNA mini kit’ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (5 μ 
g) was used for RT–PCR using 
the RNA to cDNA Ecodry premix (oligo dT) cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Resulting cDNA corresponding 
to 50 ng total RNA was used in each 20 μ 
l of quantitative real time PCR reaction. 
qRT–PCR was performed using SybrGreen master mix (Biorad) and the relative 
expression of each gene was calculated after normalizing to ACTB endogenous 
 
control and using the comparative Δ 
Ct method. A list of the primers used is in 
Supplementary Table 4.
Single-cell RNA sequencing. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in PBS. 
Twenty-one microlitres of a cellular suspension at 400 cells per microlitre, > 
95% 
viability, were loaded onto to the 10X Genomics Chromium platform to generate 
barcoded single-cell GEMs. scRNA-seq libraries were prepared according to 10X 
Genomics specifications (Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits User Guide PN-120233, 10X 
Genomics). GEM-reverse transcription (RT) (55 °C for 2 h, 85 °C for 5 min; held at 
4 °C) was performed in a C1000 Touch Thermal cycler with 96-Deep Well Reaction 
Module (Bio-Rad). After RT, GEMs were broken and the single-strand cDNA was 
cleaned up with DynaBeads MyOne Silane Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 
SPRIselect Reagent Kit (0.6 × 
 SPRI; Beckman Coulter). cDNA was amplified for 
 
14 cycles using the C1000 Touch Thermal cycler with 96-Deep Well Reaction 
Module (98 °C for 3 min; 98 °C for 15 s, 67 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 1 min × 
 14 cycles; 
 
72 °C for 1 min; held at 4 °C). The quality of the cDNA was analysed using an 
Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. The resulting cDNA was sheared to ~ 
200 bp using 
a Covaris S220 instrument (Covaris) and cleaned using 0.6× 
 SPRI beads. The 
products were end-repaired, ‘
A
’-tailed and ligated to adaptors provided in the kit. 
A unique sample index for each library was introduced through 10 cycles of PCR 
amplification using the indexes provided in the kit (98 °C for 45 s; 98 °C for 20 s, 
60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s × 
 14 cycles; 72 °C for 1 min; held at 4 °C). After two 
SPRI cleanups, libraries were quantified using Qubit fluorometric quantification 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the quality assessed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 
2100. Four libraries were pooled and clustered on a HiSeq2500 in rapid mode at 
10 pM on a pair end read flow cell and sequenced for 98 cycles of R1, followed 
by 14 bp I7 Index (10X Barcode), 8 bp I5 Index (sample index) and 10 bp on R2 
(UMI). Primary processing of sequencing images was done using Illumina’s Real 
Time Analysis software. Demultiplexing and post processing was done using the 
10X Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline per the manufacturer’s recommendations. 
scRNA-seq data were processed from raw reads to a molecule count array using 
the Cell Ranger pipeline55. Additionally, to minimize the effects of experimental 
artefacts on the analysis, data were pre-processed to filter out cells with low total 
molecule counts (library size), low complexity and high mitochondrial content, 
identified by a bimodal fit. The remaining cells were normalized by dividing the 
expression level of each gene in a cell by its total library size and then scaling by 
the median library size of all cells. After normalizing by library size, we performed 
principal component analysis to improve the robustness of the constructed Markov 
matrix generated when computing diffusion eigenvalues for imputation of dropout 
noise56. We chose the number of principal components to retain approximately 
80% of variance in the data and excluded the first principal component, which 
was highly correlated with library size. Imputation of both the normalized and 
unnormalized count matrix was performed using a Markov matrix raised to the 
power of 3 (power corresponds the approximate number of weighted nearest neigh-
bours) and with a gene expression distribution computed according to 21 nearest 
neighbouring cells, as described56. Our analysis was robust to imputation and we 
obtained similar results without imputed data (not shown). Subpopulations were 
identified using Phenograph57 and genes differentially expressed in at least one sub-
population were identified by the Kruskal–Wallis rank statistic using a bootstrap-
ping method for random downsampling of matched molecule and cell counts from 
each subpopulation. t-SNE was used to visualize subpopulation structure based on 
the first 20 principle components of the imputed count matrix, subsetted by the top

5,150 differentially expressed genes (FDR q of Kruskal–Wallis rank statistic < 
0.05). 
 
The mean expression of key gene signatures in population M versus other 
 
subpopulations was z-normalized and visualized using violin plots. All gene signatures 
 
are annotated in Supplementary Table 5. The correlation between gene signatures 
was computed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient according to the 
mean expression of all genes per signature per cell. Ward’s minimum variance 
method was applied to hierarchically cluster cells by their normalized expression 
of differentially expressed EMT genes.
Patient survival analysis. Genes used for survival analysis are listed in 
Supplementary Table 5. For the meta-analysis cohort, we used aggregate data from 
KMPlot16,58 (http://www.kmplot.com) using only JetSet best probe set and auto- 
selection for best cutoff between the 25th and 75th percentiles. For the validation 
cohort in which DMFS data were available17, we used the z-normalized expression 
data for a data set and the median value was used as a cutoff. DMFS curves were 
compared using the log-rank test.
In vitro invasion and migration assays. For the invasion and migration/ 
chemotaxis assays we used the CytoSelect cell invasion (CBA-110) and cell migration 
 
(CBA-100) kits, respectively. In brief, 3 × 105 cells were suspended in serum-free 
medium and placed on top of the membrane. Medium containing serum was placed 
at the bottom and cells that had invaded to the inferior surface of the collagen 
 
membrane were stained and counted 18–24 h later. For experiments involving 
transient transfection, cells were transfected, and thymidine (2 mM) was added 
18 h later. Cells were plated on the membrane 3 days after transfection. For the 
chemotaxis assay, we used a colorimetric approach (OD 560 nm) for quantifica-
tion. For the scratch assay, cells were treated with mitomycin C (10 μ 
g ml−1) for 
1 h when they reached > 
90% confluence and then placed in DMEM containing 
1% FBS. Wounds were applied using a p200 pipette tip and images of the wounds 
were taken immediately and at subsequent regular intervals. ImageJ was used for 
quantification of wound surface area.
Quantification of cytosolic DNA. Approximately 1 × 
 107 cells were lysed and 
the nuclear, cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions were obtained using the mito-
chondrial isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 89874). Protease inhibitors were 
not used to enable subsequent DNA purification. Mitochondria were purified by 
centrifugation at 12,000g to minimize their contamination in the cytosolic fraction. 
DNA was subsequently isolated from the nuclear, cytosolic, mitochondrial frac-
tions using the Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, 69506) and dsDNA 
was quantified using Qubit 2.0 (Invitrogen) with Qubit dsDNA HS Reagent.

formed in Python or R, and used Nextflow to manage some of the computational 
pipelines59. Code for the RNA sequencing analysis is available online at: https://

Life Sciences Reporting Summary
Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish. This form is intended for publication with all accepted life 
science papers and provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. Every life science submission will use this form; some list 
items might not apply to an individual manuscript, but all fields must be completed for clarity. 
For further information on the points included in this form, see Reporting Life Sciences Research. For further information on Nature Research 
policies, including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist. 
�    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
For disease-specific survival in MDA-MB-231 experiments, power analysis indicated 
that 10 mice per group will be sufficient to detect a difference at relative hazard 
ratios of <0.2 or >5 with 80% power and 95% confidence, given a median disease-
specific survival of 3 months in the control group and a total follow up period of 
250 days. For the 4T1 experiments, Power analysis indicates that 10 mice per 
group will be sufficient to detect a difference at relative hazard ratios of <0.25 or 
>4.0 with 80% power and 95% confidence, given a median survival of 58 days in 
the control group and a total follow up period of 180 days.
2.   Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
No data were excluded
3.   Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were 
reliably reproduced.
No attempts for replication failed. Immunofluorescence and immunoblot 
experiments were performed in three or more biological replicates (see figure 
legends). Key animal experiments were performed in up to 5 independent 
experiments
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were 
allocated into experimental groups.
No method of randomization was used
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to 
group allocation during data collection and/or analysis.
Investigators were not blinded to group allocation.
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.

11. Description of research animals
Provide details on animals and/or animal-derived 
materials used in the study.
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the 
Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. There was no 
need to randomize animals. Investigators were not blinded to group allocation. 
Intracardiac injection was performed as previously described31. Briefly, cells were 
trypsinized and washed with PBS and a 1x105 cells (in 100 μl of PBS) were injected 
into the left cardiac ventricle of female athymic 6-7 week old athymic nude (nu/nu) 
mice (Jackson Laboratory strain 002019). 2x105 cells were injected into the tail 
vein cohort of animals. Mice were then immediately injected with D-luciferin (150 
mgkg-1) and subjected to bioluminescence imaging (BLI) using tan IVIS Spectrum 
Xenogen instrument (Caliper Life Sciences) to ensure systemic dissemination of 
tumor cells. Metastatic burden was measured 5-7 weeks after injection using BLI. 
BLI images were analyzed using Living Image Software v.2.50. Disease-specific 
survival endpoint was met when the mice died or met the criteria for euthanasia 
under the IACUC protocol and had radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. For 
Orthotopic tumor implantation, 2.5x105 cells in 50μl of PBS were mixed 1:1 with 
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected into the fourth mammary fat pad. Only one 
tumor was implanted per animal. MDA-MB-231 primary tumors were surgically 
excited before they reached ~1.5 cm in the largest dimension (which was the 
maximum allowable under our IACUC protocol) and metastatic dissemination was 
assessed using BLI imaging at 1-3 week intervals for up to 30 weeks. Distant 
metastasis-free survival endpoint was met when BLI signal was seen outside of site 
of primary tumor transplantation. 4T1 tumors were excised 9 days after 
implantation. To derive short-term culture from primary tumors and metastases, 
anesthetized animals (isofluorane) were imaged then sacrificed. Ex-vivo BLI was 
subsequently performed on harvested organs to define the precise location of the 
metastatic lesion. Primary tumors and metastases were subsequently mechanically 
dissociated and cultured in DMEM with selection media (G418 or hygromycin) to 
select for tumor cells and exclude host cells. All subsequent assays (karyotyping, 
RNAseq, immunofluorescence, and subcellular fractionation) were performed after 
a single passage from the primary sample. To assess chromosome missegregation 
from primary tumor-derived and metastases-derived cells, we performed high-
resolution immunofluorescence analysis on passage #1 cells, staining for DNA 
(DAPI) and centromeres (ACA). Cells with DNA or centromere staining in the middle 
of the anaphase plate was taken as evidence of chromosome missegregation.
