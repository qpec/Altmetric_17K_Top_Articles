Abstract
Background: The ability of acute care providers to cope with the influx of frail older patients is increasingly
stressed, and changes need to be made to improve care provided to older adults. Our purpose was to conduct a
scoping review to map and synthesize the literature addressing frailty in the acute care setting in order to
understand how to tackle this challenge. We also aimed to highlight the current gaps in frailty research.
Methods: This scoping review included original research articles with acutely-ill Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
or hospitalized older patients who were identified as frail by the authors. We searched Medline, CINAHL, Embase,
PsycINFO, Eric, and Cochrane from January 2000 to September 2015.
Results: Our database search initially resulted in 8658 articles and 617 were eligible. In 67% of the articles the authors
identified their participants as frail but did not report on how they measured frailty. Among the 204 articles that did
measure frailty, the most common disciplines were geriatrics (14%), emergency department (14%), and general
medicine (11%). In total, 89 measures were used. This included 13 established tools, used in 51% of the articles, and 35
non-frailty tools, used in 24% of the articles. The most commonly used tools were the Clinical Frailty Scale, the Frailty
Index, and the Frailty Phenotype (12% each). Most often (44%) researchers used frailty tools to predict adverse health
outcomes. In 74% of the cases frailty predicted the outcome examined, typically mortality and length of stay.
Conclusions: Most studies (83%) were conducted in non-geriatric disciplines and two thirds of the articles identified
participants as frail without measuring frailty. There was great variability in tools used and more recently published
studies were more likely to use established frailty tools. Overall, frailty appears to be a good predictor of adverse health
outcomes. For frailty to be implemented in clinical practice frailty tools should help formulate the care plan and
improve shared decision making. How this will happen has yet to be determined.

Background
Providing health care to an aging population presents both
challenges and opportunities. Perhaps most important is
how we understand and respond to frailty. The concept of
frailty was introduced in the literature of geriatric medicine
and gerontology almost two decades ago to better under-
stand the heterogeneous health status of the older persons.
Since then, this area of research has grown exponentially.
Although contested, frailty is increasingly understood con-
ceptually as the increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes
among people of the same chronological age [1]. Frail indi-
viduals can be thought of as complex systems close to fail-
ure, vulnerable to further physiological and psychological
stressors caused by both intrinsic and environmental factors.
Adding one more stressor to such a system, even a stress as
minor as one more drug, may lead to a cascade effect. Not
all older adults are frail. Among community-dwelling people
over the age of 50 years approximately 20% are frail [2, 3].
Even so, levels of frailty are higher among those seen in clin-
ical settings [4].
Frail patients have higher rates of adverse outcomes,
and thus require adaptations of care, personalization of

 interventions, and modifications of standard protocols
[1, 5]. As such, identifying frailty early in clinical care is
vital [6–8]. Given its pervasive impact on health and the
outcomes of health care, it has been proposed that frailty
be considered routinely when treating the older patient
[6]. To do so we need validated tools with sound measure-
ment properties. With various instruments having been
developed, there is heated debate over how to best oper-
ationally define frailty and which tools can feasibly be used
across care settings [9, 10]. A 2007 systematic review iden-
tified 27 articles that included a frailty measure in older
adults [11]. Since then many more tools have been devel-
oped and multiple systematic reviews have been published
on them mostly focusing on community settings [2, 9,
12–15]. In a systematic review by de Vries and colleagues
in 2011, 20 frailty tools were identified and the authors
concluded that at that point the Frailty Index seemed to
be the most suitable instrument to measure frailty [9]. A
year later Pailoux and colleagues found that 10 instru-
ments have been used for screening for frailty in primary
health care [13]. Choosing among the many options avail-
able can be confusing for health care professionals.
Older frail adults are more vulnerable to health crises.
They are more likely to be hospitalized or to need critical
care, use emergency medical services, and have a longer
in-hospital length of stay [16, 17]. Many critical, life altering
decisions are made in the acute care setting during these
crises. There are indications that frailty identification and
management will improve clinical decision making and
health outcomes within acute care. For example, frailty as-
sessment by EMS and ED providers could facilitate referral
or transport to the most appropriate service and could as-
sist with identifying patients who will not benefit from ag-
gressive medical treatments. Even so, before translational
research programs focus on how frailty measures will be in-
corporated into every day care in the acute care setting and
how they will benefit clinical decisions, we need to agree on
how frailty will be measured and managed in this setting.
Currently, no systematic reviews have been conducted with
a general focus on EMS and in-hospital settings. Given the
growing numbers of frail patients and the greater use of
frailty tools within clinical settings, we conducted a scoping
review to map and synthesize the literature around frailty
in the acute care setting. This included identifying and doc-
umenting the nature and extent of research evidence re-
lated to frailty measurement and management in EMS and
in-hospital settings.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
This scoping review included original research articles pub-
lished since January 2000. Two of the most commonly used
frailty definitions, the Frailty Phenotype and the Frailty
Index, were developed in 2001 which is when the literature
around frailty started increasing. In order for the articles to
be included, the following criteria had to be met: at least
50% of the participants were acutely-ill EMS (paramedic
services) or hospitalized patients, at least one patient was
aged 65 or older, and at least one participant was identified
as frail by the authors (with or without reporting on meas-
uring frailty). We did not limit articles by language or study
design. Articles were excluded if they focused on care deliv-
ery outside of hospital or on hospitalized patients who were
not acutely ill (for example, dialysis and chemotherapy out-
patients, inpatients on rehabilitation wards or doing elective
surgeries, and subacute patients).
We searched a wide range of academic literature data-
bases including Medline, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO,
Eric, and Cochrane up to September 2015. The search terms
we used were all words that are used interchangeably as de-
scriptors of “frailty”, “aging”, “pre-hospital”, and “acute care”
in Medical Subject Headings, text, and keywords (Add-
itional file 1: Table S1). Additional articles were identified by
manually searching the reference lists of systematic reviews
focusing on frailty. We contacted authors when we needed
additional information about the eligibility of an article.
Two members of the review team independently screened
the title and abstracts and then the full text of the articles
that met the inclusion criteria. Disagreements between the
two reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer. We in-
cluded reviewers who were fluent in all relevant languages.
Data analysis
The database search results were uploaded into Refworks
where duplicates were removed. DistillerSR software was
used to manage the screening process. An excel data ex-
traction form was developed to guide collection of infor-
mation relevant to the review. The following descriptive
data was extracted from each article that satisfied the in-
clusion criteria: year of publication, language, and country.
For the articles that included a frailty measure we ex-
tracted additional descriptive data: number of participants,
participant age, participant sex, study setting (medical dis-
cipline) and design, when and how frailty was measured,
who completed the evaluation, the stated purpose for
measuring frailty, the prevalence of frailty, and any adverse
outcome measure examined in association with frailty.
Analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS 21.
Results
The initial database search resulted in 8658 articles.
After duplicates were removed (n = 2621), we screened
the title and abstract of 6037 articles and excluded
2797 from additional screening. Full text was obtained
for 3240 articles, 589 of which remained after screen-
ing. We also hand-searched the reference list of other
relevant papers, including systematic reviews focusing
on frailty; 28 additional articles were added to bring

 the final number of included articles to 617 (Fig. 1;
Additional file 1: Table S2).
In 67% of the articles (n = 413/617) the authors identi-
fied their participants as frail but did not provide an op-
erational definition of frailty or refer to use of a frailty
measurement tool (Fig. 1). Table 1 shows the descriptive
characteristics of the articles that measured frailty (33%,
n = 204) [18–221], whereas Additional file 1: Table S3
shows the descriptive characteristics of the articles that
did not include a frailty measurement.
Most of the articles (n = 442/617) reported on stud-
ies conducted in a single medical discipline. The
most
common
single
disciplines
were
geriatrics,
emergency department, general medicine, cardiology,
and orthopedics. A total of 49 studies were con-
ducted in two disciplines, with general medicine and
surgery (n = 25) being the most common combination
followed by geriatric medicine and general medicine
(n = 15). In 29 articles, the authors specified that par-
ticipants were recruited from at least 3 disciplines
and in 97 articles the authors did not specify from
which discipline the hospitalized patients were re-
cruited (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
The number of articles increased over time with more
articles published in the last 5 years of our review; 52%
(n = 318/617) were published between 2011 and 2015,
with less than 20% (n = 121) published in 2005 or earlier.
The increase in publications was even more striking
among articles which measured frailty: 69% (n = 141/
204) of articles published in 2011–2015, up from only
12% (n = 24) of those published in 2000–2005 (Table 1;
Additional file 1: Figure S2A). Almost all included arti-
cles were written in English (94%, n = 583/617). The
remaining articles were written in French (n = 11),
Italian (n = 7) [93, 102], Spanish (n = 7), Dutch (n = 4),
Portuguese (n = 3) [51, 141], and German (n = 2). Among
the 34 non-English articles, only 4 measured frailty. A
variety of countries were represented, with the majority,
59%, of the published studies conducted in Europe (n =
361/617), 25% in North America (n = 157), and 8% in
Australia or New Zealand (n = 48). Among the 204 arti-
cles that measured frailty, 48% reported on studies

 conducted in Europe (n = 98) and 36% on studies con-
ducted in North America (n = 73) (Table 1).
Based on the descriptive characteristic data extracted for
the 204 articles that measured frailty, the number of partici-
pants per study ranged from 9 to 971,434 with a median of
206 participants (interquartile range 100.5–460). The mean
age of participants ranged from 47.1 to 91.6 years with a
median of 78.9 years (interquartile range 74–82.9); for 9 ar-
ticles [26, 60, 111, 128, 136–138, 169, 211], the mean age
was less than 65 years. Among the articles that reported the
number of female and male participants (n = 187/204), the
median was 54% females (interquartile range 43.5–63%)
(Table 1). The majority of articles were observational stud-
ies (n = 166/204) and 16% were experimental (n = 32; 26
were randomized controlled trials). In total, 3% of the stud-
ies were qualitative (n = 6) [27, 69, 88, 124, 145, 181]; 3
studies examined the involvement of hospitalized older
people in decision making regarding their care (Fig. 2).
Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of frailty meas-
urement as reported in the included articles. In most
cases, frailty was measured by either a health care profes-
sional (n = 80) or a researcher (n = 81) (Additional file 1:
Figure S3). In geriatrics, oncology, surgery, and EMS
disciplines, frailty assessments were done mostly by
health care professionals, whereas in emergency de-
partment, general medicine, ICU, orthopedics, and
cardiology it was more common that assessments
were done by researchers (Additional file 1: Figure
S3). Frailty was measured at hospital admission in al-
most half of the articles (n = 94), at discharge in 5%
of the articles (n = 10), and was operationalized retro-
spectively through chart reviews or databases in 13%
of the articles (n = 27). In cardiology, orthopedics, and
EMS disciplines, more than one quarter of the articles
operationalized frailty retrospectively (Table 2).
Overall, 89 measures were used 240 times in the 204
included articles. Most of the articles included only one
frailty measure (n = 185), while 9 articles included 2
measures [45, 54, 70, 112, 163, 172, 183, 196, 212] and
10 articles included 3 or more measures (Table 2). Thir-
teen established tools, developed to measure frailty, were
used in 51% of the cases (n = 123). Thirty-five non-frailty
tools were used in 24% of the cases (n = 57). These were
validated scales but not developed to identify frailty (e.g.
short physical performance battery). In 23% of the cases
(n = 56), ad hoc measures were used which were oper-
ational definitions developed for the purpose of that
study (e.g. everyone who was older than 65 and had 2 or
more chronic diseases was considered frail). Four articles
used clinical judgment to define frailty. Established
frailty tools were the most common type of measure
across all disciplines, except the orthopedic discipline
where non-frailty scales were more common (n = 10/18
articles) (Table 2). When the results were stratified by
year of publication, we found that ad hoc measures of
frailty (n = 15/24; 63%) were most commonly used in the
oldest articles (those published between 2000 and 2005),
whereas use of established frailty tools (n = 101/174;
58%) was most common in the most recent articles
(published between 2011 and 2015), (Additional file 1:
Figure S4). In articles reporting on studies conducted in
USA, ad hoc measures were the most common (n = 26/
62; 42%). In contrast, in the rest of the countries estab-
lished frailty tools were the most common, with Canada
(n = 17/18; 94%) and Australia/New Zealand (n = 14/18;
78%) having the highest proportion.

 The Clinical Frailty Scale, the Frailty Index, and the
Frailty Phenotype were the most common tools used to
measure frailty (n = 28 each) (Additional file 1: Figure
S5). The Clinical Frailty Scale was the most popular
measure used in geriatric (n = 6/35; 17%) [34, 66, 94,
110, 185, 212] and ICU disciplines (n = 6/10; 60%) [103,
176, 190, 192, 196, 211] (Table 3), in Canada (n = 12/18;
67%) and the UK (n = 8/26; 31%) [103, 116, 139, 180,
188, 202, 207, 213], and in observational articles (n = 26/
202; 13%). The Frailty Index was the most popular
measure used in emergency departments (n = 7/33; 21%)
[93, 106, 125, 131, 163, 165, 195] and orthopedics (n = 4/
18; 22%) [126, 189, 219, 220] (Table 3), in Italy (n = 5/19;
26%) [93, 104, 106, 133] and Denmark (n = 3/8; 38%)
[189, 219, 220], and in experimental articles (n = 6/32;
19%) [50, 62, 166, 189, 219, 220]. The Frailty Phenotype
was the most popular measure used in cardiology (n = 6/
24; 25%) [45, 89, 90, 112, 172, 208] and surgery (n = 2/
10; 20%) [184, 221] (Table 3), and in Spain (n = 4/10;
40%) [90, 112, 172, 174] and Sweden (n = 2/6, 33%)
[92, 119]. Among the 122 articles that reported the
prevalence of frailty, the median prevalence was 49%.
The highest prevalence was in orthopedics (69% median
frailty prevalence) and the lowest in ICU (34% median
frailty prevalence) (Table 2).
In almost half of the articles (n = 89, 44%), researchers
used frailty for risk stratification purposes to examine
whether frailty can predict adverse health outcomes
(n = 89). In 41 articles (20%), frailty was used strictly as
an inclusion criterion for patient recruitment. In 7 arti-
cles (4%), frailty was used solely as an outcome or in
combination with risk stratification or inclusion criterion
[52, 118, 119, 132, 138, 187, 216]. In the remaining arti-
cles (n = 67, 33%), frailty was only used as a descriptive
of the sample (e.g. reporting only on the prevalence of
frailty of the sample). Risk stratification was the most
common reason for using the frailty tools across all dis-
ciplines, except in oncology where descriptive was the
most common reason (Table 2). Stratified by year of
publication (Fig. 3a), in the oldest articles (2000–2005)
frailty tools were most commonly used as inclusion cri-
terion (n = 16/24; 67%), while in the most recent articles
(2011–2015) the most common use was risk stratifica-
tion (n = 75/141; 53%); all 4 articles [118, 132, 138, 216]
that used frailty solely as an outcome were published
after 2010. In the included observational articles, risk
stratification was the most common reason (n = 84/166;
51%) whereas in the experimental articles inclusion cri-
terion was the most common (n = 16/32, 50%) (Fig. 3b).
One
of
the
experimental
studies
(prospective
non-randomized trial) modified treatment plans based
on frailty levels in cancer patients [52]. Three of the ex-
perimental studies (all randomized controlled trials)
used frailty as an outcome measure [118, 119, 216]: two
were published protocols (one of an exercise interven-
tion and one of a combined exercise and nutrition inter-
vention) and the other was a multi-professional team
approach intervention creating a continuum of care for
patients from the hospital emergency department to the
older person’s own home (no significant change in frailty
was found) [118, 216].
Among the 89 articles that used a frailty measure as a
risk stratification tool, 115 measures were included; most
often established frailty tools (n = 73, 64%), with the
most common being the Frailty Index (n = 23, 20%), the
CFS (n = 19, 17%), the Frailty Phenotype (n = 12, 10%),
and the Edmonton frailty scale (n = 6, 5%) [71, 86, 121,
149, 178, 179]. Among these 89 risk stratification arti-
cles, 228 adverse outcomes were examined. The most
frequent outcomes examined were mortality, in-hospital
length of stay, institutionalization, and complications.
Overall, in 169 cases (74%), frailty was predictive of an
outcome (i.e. statistical significant association between
frailty and the outcome measure), whereas in 59 cases it
was not (26%). Frailty was predictive of mortality in 84%
of the articles where this outcome was examined,
in-hospital length of stay in 73%, institutionalization in
93%, and complications in 69% (Fig. 4). The highest rate
for significant prediction of all outcomes combined was
in EMS (n = 1/1, 100%) [159] and general medicine
(n = 18/22, 82%) disciplines. The lowest rate was in on-
cology (n = 4/8, 50%) [49, 52, 169]. For mortality, the
highest rate for significant prediction was in general
medicine (n = 4/4, 100%) [99, 101, 116, 156] and the
lowest in oncology (n = 1/2, 50%) [49] and cardiology
(n = 7/10, 70%) [89, 121, 128, 172, 173, 208, 210]. When
we stratified analysis by type of tool, the significant pre-
diction rate was 74% (n = 122/164) for the established
frailty tools, 84% for the ad-hoc tools (n = 16/19), 100%
for clinical judgment (n = 2/2) [36, 111], and 67% for the
non-frailty scales (n = 29/43). When we stratified by
scale used, the predictive rate among the four most com-
monly used scales were 89% for the Frailty Index
(n = 39/44 outcomes), 88% for the Edmonton frail scale
(14/16 outcomes), 73% for the CFS (n = 35/48), and 53%
for the Frailty Phenotype (n = 16/30) (Fig. 5).
Discussion
We identified and documented the nature and extent of
research evidence related to frailty measurement and
management in the pre-hospital and EMS acute care set-
ting.
We
found
that
most
articles
were
done
in
non-geriatric disciplines between 2011 and 2015 in North
America or Europe. Two thirds of the articles identified
participants as frail without measuring frailty, and as time
passed, more frailty studies were conducted across all dis-
ciplines. Overall, 89 measures were used including 13
established tools and 35 non-frailty tools; more recent

 studies were more likely to use established frailty tools.
We found that the most commonly used scales were the
Clinical Frailty Scale, the Frailty Index, and the Frailty
Phenotype. Most articles were observational and used
frailty tools to predict adverse health outcomes, especially
mortality and institutionalization. Overall, frailty seems to
be a good predictor of adverse health outcomes; in 74% of
the cases frailty was predictive. When we looked at spe-
cific scales, the Frailty Index and the Edmonton scale
seemed to have the best predictive ability.
This scoping review has a number of limitations. Quality
assessments or meta-analysis were not conducted, and the
scope of the review was very broad; for example, if partici-
pants were called frail once in the discussion the article was
included. This was an appropriate first step for the field of
frailty within acute care. Now that we have identified spe-
cific areas with sufficient research evidence, the next step
for the field is to answer more focused research questions,
such as a meta-analysis on the ability of the frailty scales to
predict mortality in acute care. Another limitation of our
scoping review is that non-English articles may have been
missed because the databases searched included mostly
English journals. Also, we only included articles with
acutely-ill inpatients, which means we have not gathered
data on other articles that focused on frailty, for example,
those in rehabilitation and dialysis units, and elective
surgery. Finally, the grey literature was not reviewed.
Our scoping review includes articles published up to
September 2015. More frailty papers have since been
published. Due to the broad scope of our review and the

 pace of frailty research, it is not feasible to conduct a
completely up to date review. We are confident that the
main findings and gaps identified continue to be rele-
vant. For example, three systematic reviews published in
2017 examined frailty in surgical patients and showed
similarly to our study that the evidence about the ability
of frailty tools to predict adverse health outcomes in sur-
gical patients is limited and that even less studies have
tested whether interventions can improve perioperative
outcomes in surgical patients [222–224]. Another sys-
tematic review showed that frailty is common in patients
admitted to ICU and is associated with higher hospital
and long-term mortality [225]. A recent scoping review
focused on frailty and acute care literature that was pub-
lished between 2005 and 2015 in two databases and
similarly with our review recommended that future re-
search should focus on experimental studies [226].
Strengths of this study include an in-depth search
strategy and very broad scope. We included all acute
care specialties and synthesized the findings based on
that. Due to this, clinicians and decisions makers will be
able to review specific evidence pertaining directly to
their specialty. We also involved reviewers with fluency
in all relevant languages which allowed us to map and
synthesize all the available literature around frailty in
acute care. Finally, we did a detailed search for evidence
related to EMS care which usually is excluded from
frailty reviews. EMS frailty screening by paramedics
could facilitate referral or transport to the most appro-
priate service as paramedics are in a unique position to
document the living conditions and function of an older
person within their own home [227].
Moreover, the purpose of this review was to highlight
the current gaps in frailty research. We found that
non-frailty tools were commonly used to identify frailty.
Established frailty tools better capture the multidimen-
sional nature of frailty than unidimensional non-frailty
tools. We also found that frailty was rarely used in ex-
perimental and qualitative articles and was rarely used
as an outcome measure. It was mostly used within geri-
atrics, emergency department, general medicine, and
cardiology; information for other medical specialties is
lacking. When frailty was used to predict outcomes,
rarely were patient-oriented measures, such as function
and quality of life included. In addition, since almost no
clinical trials have been conducted with a focus on
frailty, no guidelines exist on how care planning can be
modified based on frailty. These research gaps need to
be filled in order to implement frailty assessment and
management plans in clinical practice, and to start the
discussion about changes in policy.
This review highlights seven important call to ac-
tion items:
� Identify participants as frail only when it has been
measured.
In 67% of the articles the authors identified
their participants as frail but did not report on
how they measured frailty.
� Report details of when and who measured frailty
and other details about feasibility (e.g. time to
complete assessment).
In 13% of the articles the authors did not
report when frailty was measured and in 19%
authors did not report who measured frailty.
� Use established frailty tools to measure frailty.
Established tools were only used in 51% of
the cases.
� Conduct observational studies using patient-oriented
outcomes.

Page 13 of 20
 Quality of life and functional decline only
accounted for 4% of outcomes examined.
� Conduct qualitative studies about frailty.
Only 3% of the studies (n = 6) were qualitative
[27, 69, 88, 124, 145, 181].
� Conduct experimental studies about modifying
treatment plans based on frailty level.
Only one prospective study modified treatment
plans based on frailty [52].
� Conduct experimental studies using frailty as an
outcome.
Only 2% of the studies (n = 3) were clinical
trials which used frailty as an outcome
measure; two of them were published protocols
[118, 119, 216].
The ability of acute care settings to cope with the in-
flux of frail older patients may be reaching a limit, and
unless changes are made in its organization, it seems in-
evitable that care provided to the older adult will suffer.
Even though we presently lack strong evidence, identify-
ing the frail people, those at higher risk for adverse out-
comes, within EMS and in-hospital settings may lead to
improvements in care. The development of a routinely
collected frailty measure, such as the electronic Frailty
Index of The National Health Service of England [228],
can facilitate frailty to be considered in patients who
come to hospital. How this will affect care has yet to be
determined. Currently, comprehensive geriatric assess-
ment (which also includes patient management) is the
most effective intervention for frail older patients [229]
and can also impact the patient’s frailty level. For ex-
ample, a primary care model focusing on comprehensive
geriatric assessment and goal-setting reversed frailty
levels among older patients [230].
Recognizing the value of measuring frailty may benefit
the patient and the health care system alike. By identify-
ing frail individuals, we could increase patient-centered
care and have a more efficient and effective health care
system. It could lead to more targeted assessments for
people who need them and end the unnecessary assess-
ments of severely frail people. Therefore, frailty can as-
sist clinicians in identifying patients who might benefit
more from innovative processes of care than from ag-
gressive medical treatments. Also, clinicians can use the
information from the frailty assessments to discuss with
patients and caregivers the risks and benefits of possible
treatments, which can lead to a more informed and ra-
tional shared decision.
Conclusions
This scoping review showed that most studies were con-
ducted in non-geriatric disciplines and identified partici-
pants as frail without measuring frailty. There was great
variability in tools used to measure frailty. The more re-
cently published studies were more likely to use estab-
lished frailty tools and the most commonly used scales
were the Clinical Frailty Scale, the Frailty Index, and the
Frailty Phenotype. Most studies used frailty tools to pre-
dict adverse health outcomes, especially mortality and
institutionalization. Overall, frailty appears to be a good
predictor of adverse health outcomes.
