Objectives: The Latarjet procedure is commonly performed using either the classic (standing) or the congruent‐arc 
(lying) technique. There are potential clinical advantages and disadvantages of each technique. However, the 
anatomic and biomechanical effects, benefits, and limitations of each technique are unknown. The purpose of this 
study was to compare the anatomy and biomechanical strength of fixation between the two techniques. 
Methods: A biomechanical cadaver study was performed with 20 pairs of male and female shoulders (n=40). One 
of each pair of shoulders was randomly assigned to receive the classic or congruent‐arc technique. Coracoid and 
glenoid anatomic measurements were collected prior to biomechanical testing. A pull force was applied through 
the conjoined tendon to replicate forces experienced by the coracoid graft in the early post‐operative period, and 
the failure load was determined for each specimen (Figure 1). 
Results: The mean surface area available for fixation in the classic technique was 263.3 mm2 compared to 177.0 
mm2 in the congruent‐arc group (p<0.001). In the classic group, 36% of the glenoid width was re‐created, and 50% 
was re‐created in the congruent‐arc group (p<0.001). The congruent‐arc technique resulted in a significantly lower 
(p=0.005) mean failure load (238.9 ± 91.2 N) compared to the classic technique (303.0 ± 114 N). Failure load was 
significantly higher in males (p=0.037); male specimens had a mean failure load of 343.9 ± 122.2 N for the classic 
technique and 289.4 ± 73.0 N for the congruent‐arc technique, and females had a mean failure load of 266.1 ± 
97.7 and 193.5 ± 84.0 N, respectively (Figure 2). 
Conclusion: In this biomechanical model, the classic technique of the Latarjet procedure provided a greater 
surface area for healing to the glenoid and greater biomechanical strength of fixation when compared to the 
congruent‐arc technique. The congruent‐arc technique allowed restoration of a larger glenoid defect.

before complete failure. To address the primary hypothesis of this study, the strength of each Latarjet technique was assessed 
while accounting for the size and density of individual coracoid specimens. Mixed-effects ANOVA models were built to assess 
the effect of Latarjet technique (repeated measures on paired specimens) on failure load and load-to-first motion, adjusted for 
gender. An a priori power analysis indicated that 20 specimen pairs would be sufficient to detect an effect size of f=0.33 with 
80% power.
