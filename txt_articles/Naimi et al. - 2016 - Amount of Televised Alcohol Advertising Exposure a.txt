ABSTRACT. Objective: Although studies demonstrate that exposure to
brand-specific alcohol advertising is associated with an increased likeli-
hood of youth consuming particular brands, the relationship between
quantity of brand-specific advertising exposure and quantity of brand-
specific consumption has not been firmly established. Method: Using
the Alcohol Brand Research Among Underage Drinkers (ABRAND)
national sample of 1,031 young drinkers (ages 13–20), this study ex-
amined the relationship between their aggregated past-year exposure to
advertising (in adstock units, a measure based on gross rating points)
for 61 alcohol brands that advertised on the 20 most popular nonsports
television programs viewed by underage youth and their aggregated total
consumption of those same brands during the past 30 days. Predictive
models adjusted for other media exposure, predictors of youth’s alcohol
consumption, and the consumption of brands not advertised on the 20
shows. Results: For the fully adjusted models, each 100 adstock unit
increase in exposure (about 1 SD) was associated with an increase of
5.9 drinks (95% CI [0.9, 11.0 drinks]) consumed during the past 30 days
among those with less than 300 units of advertising exposure, and an
increase of 55.7 drinks (95% CI [13.9, 97.4 drinks]) among those with
300 or more adstock units of exposure. Conclusions: Among underage
youth, the quantity of brand-specific advertising exposure is positively
associated with the total quantity of consumption of those advertised
brands, even after controlling for the consumption of non-advertised
brands. Future research should examine exposure–consumption rela-
tionships longitudinally and in other media. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 77,

A
LCOHOL CONSUMPTION CONTRIBUTES to the
three leading causes of death (motor vehicle crash fa-
talities, suicide, and homicide) among underage youth ages
12–20 years (Donovan, 2013). Alcohol advertising exposure
has been positively associated with youth’
s alcohol consump-
tion, and restrictions on alcohol marketing are recommended
as preventive interventions by the Institute of Medicine and
the World Health Organization (Bonnie & O’Connell, 2004;
World Health Organization, 2010).
Alcohol companies, through self-regulatory guidelines,
tacitly acknowledge the importance of alcohol marketing by
restricting advertising on television programs where the au-
dience is disproportionately composed of underage persons,
and by limiting the content of such advertising so that it does
not primarily appeal to underage youth (Beer Institute, 2011;
Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, 2011; Wine
Institute, 2012). Even so, the role that advertising plays in
drinking behaviors is still an area of scientific controversy
(Nelson, 2010).
An important limitation of previous studies is that they
have examined the relationship between total advertising
exposure and total consumption across all types of alcohol
or for broad categories of alcohol (e.g., beer, wine, distilled
spirits). This approach does not permit an examination of
the more specific relationship between brand-specific ex-
posure and brand-specific consumption. This is important
because advertising is brand specific, some brands advertise
more than others, and different brands advertise to different
populations.
Our research team has addressed this limitation by com-
bining data about brand-specific advertising exposure with
data on brand-specific alcohol consumption. After account-
ing for a variety of factors, including overall adult market
share, we found a strong positive relationship between brand-
specific exposure to television advertising and the likelihood
of youth consuming a particular brand, at both the individual
level (Ross et al., 2014) and the population level (Ross et al.,
2014, 2015).
This finding is consistent with the Heuristic Marketing
Receptivity Model, which posits that marketing-specific
cognitions and attitudes in four domains mediate the associa-
tion between alcohol advertising and consumption: alcohol
expectancies, perceptions of alcohol norms, identifying one-

self as a drinker, and brand loyalty (McClure et al., 2013).
This result might also be understood as a “mere exposure”
effect, by which consumers develop a preference for certain
products simply because of their greater familiarity, and is an
effect that can occur outside conscious awareness (Bornstein,
1989; Zajonc, 2001).
Our earlier study corroborated other studies indicating
that advertising exposure is associated with brand selection
by underage drinkers, but the question remains whether
advertising affects how much of those brands a person
drinks (Anderson et al., 2009; Smith & Foxcroft, 2009). A
previous study by our research team found that increased
brand-specific advertising exposure was significantly as-
sociated with increased brand-specific consumption (Ross
et al., 2015). However, even if advertising has an effect on
the quantity of consumption of a particular brand, another
important question is whether this might lead to decreased
consumption of other brands (i.e., brand substitution) and
therefore have no impact or a minimal impact on total
consumption.
The present study was designed to address the relation-
ship between aggregate brand-specific advertising and total
brand-specific consumption, overall and among various
demographic groups and at different levels of advertising
exposure. We hypothesized that increased aggregated expo-
sure to brand-specific advertising would be associated with
increased total consumption of those same brands.
Method
Study population used to assess alcohol consumption
among underage youth
The Alcohol Brand Research Among Underage Drink-
ers (ABRAND) survey was the source of data for alcohol
consumption among underage youth (Siegel et al., 2013).
The national sample comprised 1,032 persons ages 13–20
who reported drinking alcohol in the past 30 days. Those
ages 18–20 years were recruited directly from the Knowl-
edgePanel® maintained by Knowledge Networks (GfK
Custom Research, Palo Alto, CA), a pre-recruited panel of
approximately 50,000 adults (including young adults ages
18–20) who agreed to be invited periodically to participate
in Internet-based surveys. The company recruits households
to the panel through a combination of random-digit dialing
and address-based sampling from a sampling frame that
includes 97% of U.S. households (Knowledge Networks,
2012). To ensure adequate representation across race/eth-
nicity, telephone numbers from phone banks with higher
concentrations of Blacks and Hispanics are oversampled. To
ensure adequate participation across levels of socioeconomic
status, persons agreeing to participate in the panel who do
not have Internet access are given WebTV and Internet ac-
cess and training for free.
Participants ages 13–17 were recruited by asking adult
KnowledgePanel® members if they had children in this
age range in their household whom they would permit to
be surveyed. If so, one child was randomly selected for
participation. These younger participants were screened and
consented separately from their parents to ensure the confi-
dentiality of their responses. For participants ages 13–17, the
response rate was 44.4%, and it was 43.4% for those ages
18–20. The survey was conducted from December 2011
through May 2012. One participant reported drinking more
than 15 drinks a day for each of 20-plus brands of alcohol;
removing this participant left an analytic sample consisting
of 1,031 participants.
Boston University Medical Center’s institutional review
board approved the study protocol.
Measures of advertising exposure and other covariates
The primary exposure was aggregated brand-specific tele-
vision advertising. The survey provided participants with a
list of the 20 most popular nonsports television shows among
underage youth (by total viewership) that contained alcohol
advertising and asked them to identify which programs they
had watched in the past 30 days. Under a license agreement
with Nielsen (2015 © The Nielsen Company, New Y
ork, NY,
data from 2011–2012 used under license, all rights reserved),
we had access to audience data and brand-specific advertis-
ing data for each of those shows for the year before the
ABRAND survey, which allowed us to calculate a past-year
cumulative advertising exposure (adstock) measure for each
survey respondent.
Advertising exposure is measured in gross rating points
(GRPs), which are per capita advertising exposure measures
calculated by dividing the advertising exposures seen by
a demographic group by the population size of the demo-
graphic group and multiplying by 100. Adstock is the past-
year cumulative advertising exposure for each participant
based on GRPs. Advertising effects are not just driven by
the most recent advertising exposure, but rather are the result
of cumulative advertising exposure over time (Broadbent,
1997; Wind & Sharp, 2009). Past advertising exposures are
discounted by a decay rate with a specified half-life, which
is typically 3 to 4 weeks for frequently purchased consumer
goods (Broadbent, 1997).
In this analysis, we used a decay rate half-life of 4 weeks,
which discounts prior exposure by 50% per month. Thus, our
adstock calculation is as follows:
Adstock = ExposureDec + ExposureNov
0.5 +
ExposureOct
0.25 + . . . + ExposureJan
0.000488
where Exposure is the sum of the participants’ total monthly
exposure (in GRPs) to alcohol advertising across all brands
on the 20 television programs. To make full use of the
available data, we calculated adstock units using the full

12 months of data. Adstock may be accumulated over any
period, but with a half-life of 4 weeks, exposure more than a
few months in the past contributes a very negligible amount
to the total adstock value.
We stratified our analyses on the basis of lower (<300
adstock units) versus higher (≥300 adstock units) cumula-
tive advertising exposure from the 20 television shows. This
bifurcation was based on an unadjusted Loess curve that
demonstrated a steeper slope starting at approximately 300
adstock units of exposure. Because of the overall nonlinear
relationship, only results from stratified analyses are present-
ed. Of the sample, only 41 participants (3%) were exposed to
300 or more adstock units of advertising, yet they accounted
for 10.1% of the weighted consumption of the 61 brands.
Across the 61 brands, 1 SD in total advertising exposure was
equivalent to 96.57 adstock units.
The outcome measure was the survey participants’ aggre-
gated consumption of the 61 alcohol brands that advertised
during the past year on one or more of the 20 television
programs. To assess consumption of those brands, the
ABRAND study had provided the participants with a list
of 898 major brands of alcohol, grouped into alcohol types
(e.g., beer, bourbon, vodka). Participants indicated the num-
ber of days in the past 30 days that they had consumed a
specific brand of alcohol and how many drinks, on average,
they consumed on a typical drinking day. For each brand, the
total number of brand-specific drinks consumed in the past
30 days was the product of the number of drinks times the
number of drinking days.
Covariates included age, which was calculated from
the participants’ date of birth. We classified self-reported
race/ethnicity into four categories: non-Hispanic White,
Black/African American, Hispanic, and other. We divided
household income—as reported by adult participants in the
KnowledgePanel®—into four categories: under $15,000;
$15,000–$39,999; $40,000–$99,999; and $100,000 or higher.
We assessed smoking with the question, “During the past
30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?”
The responses options were 0 days, 1 or 2 days, 3–5 days,
6–9 days, 10–19 days, 20–29 days, and all 30 days. We
dichotomized the data as “reported smoking” versus “no
reported smoking.” We assessed risk-taking propensity by
asking about seatbelt use as follows: “How often do you
wear a seatbelt when you are riding in or driving a car?” The
response options were never, rarely, sometimes, most of the
time, always, I don’t know, which we dichotomized as “al-
ways” versus any other answer. To assess parental drinking
we asked, “Do you have a parent, guardian, or other adult
caretaker who now or previously lived in your household
who drinks alcohol at least once a month?” The respondents
answered yes or no.
We controlled for other media use by assessing average
daily television viewing hours (a weighted average of self-
reported weekday and weekend television viewing time) and
Internet use (typical daily usage in hours). To control for the
consumption of additional alcohol brands, we calculated
each participant’s consumption of alcohol brands that were
not advertised on the 20 television programs, which we re-
fer to here as “non-advertised” brands, although they might
have been advertised on other programs or in other media.
We also calculated the proportion of non-advertised brands
consumed relative to all brands.
Brand-specific covariates included the (a) alcoholic
beverage type (malts, including beer and flavored alcoholic
beverages; spirits, including bourbon, cordials and liqueurs,
cognac, rum, scotch, tequila, vodka, and whiskey; and wine);
(b) the average brand price (above or below the median price
of a U.S. standard drink); and (c) brand consumption preva-
lence among persons ages 13–20.
We acquired brand prices from the ABRAND project’s
Minimum Financial Outlay database (www.youthalcohol-
brands.com/outlay.html), which reports the average price per
ounce of ethanol for 951 alcohol brands in 2011 (DiLoreto
et al., 2012). We stratified brands based on the median price
for the 61 brands that advertised on the 20 television shows
into higher priced brands (those >$1.94 per ounce of alcohol
in off-premise outlets) versus lower priced brands.
We determined the prevalence of brand-level consumption
among underage youth (to assess “popularity”) by examining
the ABRAND Brand Preference Database, which reports the
proportion of persons ages 13–20 who had consumed each
of several brands in the past 30 days (www.youthalcohol-
brands.com/brand-pref-database.html). Using a median split,
we stratified the 61 brands that advertised on the 20 televi-
sion shows into more popular brands (>2.6% consumption
prevalence) versus less popular brands.
Analysis
Participant data were weighted to account for selection
probability and nonresponse to panel recruitment and attri-
tion and were adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, census
region, household income, home ownership status, metro-
politan area, and household size based on the Current Popu-
lation Survey from the United States Census Bureau. We
conducted the analyses using SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC).
First, we examined the crude association between each
participant’s aggregated past-year alcohol advertising ex-
posure (based on the 61 brand-specific exposures) and total
alcohol consumption (based on the past-30-day consumption
of those 61 brands) by graphing a locally estimated scatter
plot smoothing (Loess) curve (Cleveland & Devlin, 1988).
Next, we assessed the association between aggregated
alcohol advertising exposure and aggregated alcohol con-
sumption using linear regression. We first calculated the
unadjusted association and then added covariates in four
blocks: (a) demographics, including age, sex, race/ethnicity,
 726
JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / SEPTEMBER 2016
and household income; (b) media consumption, including
television and Internet use; (c) parental drinking and other
risk behaviors (e.g., cigarette smoking); and (d) consumption
of brands not advertised on the 20 television programs. We
included all covariates in the full model.
Finally, we conducted stratified analyses that examined
separately the results for males versus females, participants
ages 13–17 years of age versus 18–20 years of age, beer ver-
sus distilled spirits versus wine brands, higher priced versus
lower priced brands, and more popular versus less popular
brands.
Results
Among the sample of young drinkers, the median number
of drinks consumed in the past 30 days was 5 drinks, with
an interquartile range of 24 drinks. After weighting, the 61
brands advertised on those programs accounted for 46.9% of
all alcohol consumption reported by the sample of underage
drinkers.
Figure 1 shows the unadjusted association between past-
year advertising exposure and the total number of drinks
consumed in the past 30 days, aggregated across the 61 al-
cohol brands advertised on 20 television shows popular with
youth. The average number of drinks consumed per underage
youth during the past 30 days increased from 14 to 33 drinks
per month as advertising exposure increased from 0 to 300
adstock units. For participants in the entire sample exposed
to 300 or more adstock units of advertising, per-person con-
sumption increased from 33 drinks to more than 200 drinks
consumed during the past 30 days. Because of the nonlinear
relationship demonstrated by the Loess curve, in the tables
we present results stratified on the basis of advertising
exposure.
Results of the linear regression models are presented in
Table 1. In unadjusted models, among participants with less
than 300 adstock units of cumulative exposure, each 100 ad-
stock unit increase in advertising exposure (approximately 1
SD) was associated with a mean increase of 6.5 drinks (95%
CI [1.4, 11.5]) consumed during the past 30 days, whereas
for those with exposure of 300 or more adstock units the
increase was 74.6 drinks (95% CI [34.6, 114.6]). Adjustment
for different sets of covariates made relatively small changes
in these estimates. After adjustment for all covariates, among
participants with less than 300 adstock units of exposure the
increase was 5.9 drinks (95% CI [0.9, 11.0]), and for those
with 300 or more adstock units of exposure the increase was
55.7 drinks (95% CI [13.9, 97.4]).
In fully adjusted analyses restricted to those with less than
300 units of adstock exposure and stratified by demographic
and brand characteristics (Table 2), each 100-unit increase
in past-year adstock exposure was associated with a nonsig-

nificant increase of 6.1 drinks among males, but a significant
increase of 8.1 drinks (95% CI [2.5, 13.6]) among females.
By age, 18- to 20-year-olds had a significant increase in the
number of drinks consumed (6.5, 95% CI [0.5, 12.6]). In
analyses stratified on the basis of alcohol brand character-
istics, there was a significant positive association between
exposure and number of drinks consumed for spirits brands
(4.6, 95% CI [0.1, 9.0] drinks), lower priced brands (7.2,
95% CI [1.4, 13.1] drinks), and more popular brands (10.4,
95% CI [2.8, 18.1] drinks).
Discussion
Among this national sample of underage youth, there was
a significant positive relationship between their aggregated
past-year exposure to advertising and the total quantity of
alcohol consumed in the past 30 days, even after control-
ling for consumption of non-advertised brands. Although
exposure to alcohol advertising is related to which brands
underage youth drink (Ross et al., 2014), few studies have
assessed whether the quantity of advertising exposure is
positively associated with the total quantity of alcohol con-
sumed by underage youth (Snyder et al., 2006).
We believe that this is the first study to examine this
relationship using brand-specific advertising data and corre-
sponding brand-specific consumption, which greatly increas-
es the specificity of the exposure–consumption relationship
and therefore makes it more plausible that advertising is in
fact related to consumption. Furthermore, controlling for the
consumption of non-advertised brands serves to address the
question of whether advertising might affect the consump-
tion of particular brands without affecting the overall amount
of alcohol consumed. Our findings suggest that the increased
consumption of advertised brands is not being cancelled
out by the decreased consumption of other brands (brand
substitution).
Although there was a temporal relationship between past-
year advertising exposure (with a decay factor built in for
the decreased effect of advertising over time) and current
consumption, this study is largely cross-sectional in nature,
so there is the possibility of reverse causation. Note, how-
ever, that there was a dose-response relationship: although
the findings were significant among underage youth with
less than 300 adstock units of advertising exposure, the
exposure–consumption relationship was particularly strong
among those with 300 or more adstock units of exposure.
There were fewer youth with these higher levels of advertis-
ing exposure, but they consumed a disproportionately large
amount of the alcohol consumed by the entire youth sample.
Of note, youth who drink most heavily experience the major-
ity of alcohol-related harms (Roberts et al., 2015).

tionship among participants with high levels of aggregate

JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / SEPTEMBER 2016
brand-specific advertising exposure differs from the tradi-
tional diminishing marginal product curve associated with
advertising effects on brand selection and brand-specific
consumption (Ross et al., 2015). Our results could be at-
tributable to cross-brand advertising effects, where adver-
tising for one alcohol brand is associated with increased
consumption of other advertised brands (Hanssens et al.,
2005; Vakratsas & Ambler, 1999). Alternatively, there may
be differences in confounding factors or nonresponse bi-
ases among those with different levels of advertising expo-
sure, or an artifact from measurement error amplification
that arises from aggregating consumption and exposure
measures across brands.
This study is subject to several caveats and limitations.
Logistically, the study could not assess the participants’ ex-
posure to all television shows, and therefore the number of
advertised brands we could examine was limited. Our strat-
egy was to focus on the 20 most popular television shows
among underage youth, and we found that the alcohol brands
advertised on those programs during the past year accounted
for nearly half of all alcohol consumed by the youth sample
in the past 30 days.
Although we controlled for total television and Internet
viewing hours, we could not fully account for the par-
ticipant’s exposure to other sources of alcohol advertising.
However, controlling for the consumption of non-advertised
brands and several other relevant covariates mitigated this
potential limitation. In addition, we could only control for
a limited number of other potential confounders that could
be associated with both television viewing and alcohol con-
sumption (e.g., psychological factors).
Finally, this study is subject to possible nonresponse
bias. Because the sample of 18- to 20-year-olds drew from
existing Knowledge Networks panelists, we compared 18- to
20-year-old respondents to nonrespondents based on demo-
graphic factors to help assess the nature of potential nonre-
sponse bias, using a chi-square test to assess the significance
of observed differences. The nonrespondents were slightly
older (p < .05) but similar in gender (p = .41) and region
of the country (p = .11). However, nonrespondents were
more likely to be Black (p < .0001), be from lower income
households (p < .01), and not have Internet access before
being enrolled in the panel (p < .0001). This type of analysis
was not possible for the 13- to 17-year-old nonrespondents,
nor do we know how these factors associate with advertising
exposure or alcohol consumption.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that the amount of exposure to tele-
vision alcohol advertising is associated with the quantity of
alcohol consumed by underage youth, not just which brands
they consume. In addition, there was a stronger association
between advertising and consumption at higher levels of
exposure. This study should prompt a reevaluation of the
industry’
s self-regulatory framework (Federal Trade Commis-
sion, 2014) in order to reduce advertising exposure among
underage youth, particularly at higher levels. Future research
should examine exposure–consumption relationships longitu-
dinally and in other media and should assess larger numbers
of youth with higher levels of advertising exposure.
