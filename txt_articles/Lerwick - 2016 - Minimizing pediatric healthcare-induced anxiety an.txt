 their environment. This sense of helplessness, coupled 
with fear and pain can cause children to feel powerless 
in healthcare settings. These emotional responses 
can delay important medical treatment, take more 
time to complete and can reduce patient satisfaction. 
Healthcare professionals are uniquely positioned 
to prevent healthcare-induced trauma and reduce 
healthcare-induced anxiety. This article introduces a 
new way to choice, agenda, resilience and emotion 
(CARE) for pediatric patients in the healthcare setting 
by implementing the four following treatment principles 
called the care process: (1) Choices: Offer power in a 
powerless environment; (2) Agenda: Let patients and 
families know what to expect and what is expected of 
them; (3) Resilience: Highlight strengths and reframe 
negatives; and (4) Emotional support: Recognize and 
normalize common fears and responses. Engaging 
the CARE principles helps patients and families feel 
empowered and mitigates, reduces, and may even 
ameliorate risk of anxiety and trauma responses.

Abstract
Frequently, episodes of care such as preventive 
clinic visits, acute care, medical procedures, and 
hospitalization can be emotionally threatening and 
psychologically traumatizing for pediatric patients. 
Children are often subject to psychological trauma, 
demonstrated by anxiety, aggression, anger, and similar 
expressions of emotion, because they lack control of

INTRODUCTION
Pediatric patients visit primary healthcare providers in 
ambulatory settings an average 31 times from birth 
to age 21 for general wellness visits
[1]. Additionally, 
in 2012 alone, 5.9 million United States children 
were hospitalized
[2], adding to the average number 
of medical interactions. Annually, millions of children 
further encounter ancillary medical caregivers, in­
cluding medical assistants, nursing staff, laboratory 
and radiology technologists, occupational, speech, 
and physical and mental health therapists. These 
children can also be passive participants in sometimes­
stressful conversations with administrative professionals 
regarding finances and insurance coverage. Most 
concerning, up to 20% of the population reports feeling 
“white coat syndrome” when coming into contact with 
medical doctors
[3]. 
Children commonly report feeling afraid or an­
xious as they anticipate and engage in healthcare 
settings with medical professionals
[4­6]. Due to their 
developmental level and limited cognitive development, 
children use behavior
, instead of words, to communicate 
the emotions they feel. Common behavioral demon­
strations of fear, anxiety, and helplessness include 
aggression, withdrawal, lack of cooperation, and 
regression
[7]. Of note, psychological and behavioral 
distress has been present regardless of the incidence of 
invasive or painful healthcare
[7]. This distress impedes 
provider execution of medical protocols, thus requiring 
more time in the treatment process.
Being that children are as emotive as they are 
cognitive, during episodes of care, interactions with 
medical providers can enhance anxiety or trauma, or 
at worst, cause trauma
[8­12]. It is important for medical 
providers to learn to mitigate psychological trauma in 
pediatric care. Left untreated, childhood trauma caused 
by healthcare­induced anxiety can cause significant 
mental health issues in a child’s life
[4,5,13­15]. Trauma 
predisposes children to various forms of psychopathology 
including anxiety
[15], major depression
[13], and behavior 
problems
[14], which can increase cost of care in the 
future.
Current strategies for reducing anxiety and stress 
in children include distraction
[16], creating an inviting 
physical environment
[17], child and parental pre­
paration
[16,18] and positive staff interactions
[16]. Although 
these aspects of pediatric patient care are important, 
they are limited in scope to meet the emotional needs 
of a stressed child. In an effort to reduce healthcare­
induced distress leading to anxiety, trauma, and 
trauma responses in children, this author developed 
four principles in the choice, agenda, resilience and 
emotion (CARE) process: (1) Choices: Provide power 
in a powerless environment; (2) Agenda: Letting the 
patient and family know what to expect and what is 
expected of them; (3) Resilience: Start with strengths 
and reframe negatives; and (4) Emotions: Reco­
gnize and normalize common fears and responses. 
Through the process of implementing CARE, a child’
s healthcare­induced distress can be minimized. 
This article will introduce a new way to CARE for the 
psychosocial needs of pediatric patients across all 
healthcare settings. 
ANXIETY AND TRAUMA IN THE 
HEALTHCARE SETTING 
Throughout a child’s life, approximately 15% to 
20% will encounter some form of relatively severe 
trauma
[19,20]. Developmentally speaking, even 
common events, including medical care
[4,5], can lead 
to heightened anxiety, and trigger trauma responses 
in children
[20­24]. Because children are bewildered in 
an unknown medical environment, as caregivers 
are taking over control of their bodies, they feel a 
loss of autonomy and control. Further
, unmet needs, 
sense of danger, and lack of competence amplify 
anxiety
[25]. Children fear mutilation, and suffer from 
guilt, pain, rage, and similar manifestations specific 
to their developmental level
[4,5,8­12]. Anxiety­provoking 
experiences such as hospitalizations and medical care 
can effect a child’s physical growth, personality, or 
emotional development
[20­24]. In some cases anxiety­
based trauma may prejudice the development of 
behavioral, emotional, or cognitive disorders
[26,27]. 
Findings from longitudinal studies have delineated 
three broad sets of factors that predict differential 
risk in developing psychopathologies
[24]. The factors 
noted include: (1) children who exhibit high degrees of 
psychopathology before traumatic exposure; (2) level of 
exposure and frequency of exposure to trauma
[28]; and 
(3) social factors emerge as the strongest predictors of 
risk among traumatized children
[15,22,23]. Many children 
who have been exposed to acute trauma have shown 
relatively strong outcomes with socially­supportive 
environments
[29]. Additional risk factors include children 
with limited intellectual ability, female, younger age, 
instability in family life, and intense exposure to 
frightening events; children with these risk factors may 
recover at a slower pace and may need professional 
intervention
[15]. Children, as well as their parents and 
guardians, are psychologically unprepared for anxiety 
and the resulting emotional strain from a medical crisis.

Lerwick JL. Healthcare-induced anxiety and trauma
 FACES OF HEALTHCARE-INDUCED 
TRAUMA
Most people can relate to an experience in their lives 
during which a healthcare visit or medical procedure 
was upsetting and anxiety­provoking. Some may even 
describe their experience as traumatizing. Distressing 
scenarios might include vaccinations as a child, a 
medical diagnosis with a poor prognosis, or perhaps 
a diagnosis requiring surgery. This author recalls an 
early childhood experience of undergoing anesthesia 
for a peritonsillar abscess. Her fear of and fight against 
needles prohibited a pre­op IV start and a mask was 
placed over her nose and mouth. She gasped for air
, 
all the while pleading to the anesthesiologist she could 
not breathe. Her fear was dismissed and minimized 
when the anesthesiologist responded by telling her 
“she was fine”. This author remembers feeling like 
she was in danger because she felt as if she could not 
breathe. She had no pre­surgical preparation for the 
sudden fear and panic. Had she been told in advance 
what it might feel like to have a mask placed over her 
face, or to know it is a common feeling to gasp for 
air as part of the anesthesia process, her fears and 
therefore healthcare­induced trauma, would have been 
prevented. Sadly, this is not an uncommon experience 
for children in healthcare settings.
Another example is Amelia, an 18­mo old, fe­
male recovering from acute stress disorder due to 
healthcare­induced trauma resulting from repeated 
episodes of care in the Emergency Department (ED) 
at a highly regarded Children’s Hospital for flu­like 
symptoms causing severe dehydration leading to 
listlessness. Each time she was taken to the ED by her 
high­functioning parents, they were instructed to hold 
her down for catheterization in order to obtain a urine 
sample to rule out bacterial infection. Additionally, 
she was held down for intravenous (IV) fluids tube 
insertion, which was difficult to insert and took several 
attempts to place. This process of catheterization 
and IV attempts repeated itself several times as she 
was evaluated by the physician in the ED, released, 
evaluated again in the ED, admitted into the hospital, 
discharged, and then re­admitted. This little girl 
was scared, confused, and seemingly terrorized by 
strangers (medical providers) and those she trusted 
(parents). Each of these ED admissions took hours to 
complete as the child lay helpless in defense to the 
medical professionals that needed to triage and treat 
her illness. The parents looked on with bewilderment, 
doing their best to keep calm despite their daughter’s 
condition.
Upon hearing the parent’s distress over the psy­
chological state of their child throughout the course 
of hospitalization and discharge, a Child Life Specialist 
provided the patient’s mother with this author’s 
name and recommended that she follow­up for her 
daughter’s post­hospitalization mental health care. 
At first they saw no reason to call, then after a few 
weeks, the author saw the child at an office visit and 
evaluated her
. Behavioral issues, intense separation 
anxiety, refusal to allow diaper changes without being 
held down, and severe sleeping issues were noted on 
the intake form as new or regressive behaviors. The 
author went to work immediately with bi­weekly play 
therapy appointments, giving the toddler control and 
power in the playroom by inviting her to direct her 
own play (non­directive play therapy
[30]). The goal was 
to invite some semblance of power in her life after the 
medical care experience ripped away what she knew 
of safety and security. After 16­sessions over 8­wk, 
the child’s symptom’s completely resolved and she was 
back to her usual self. To be clear
, it took one month 
before mental health intervention for the trauma to get 
worse, and 2 mo of psychological treatment to resolve.
Medical providers must be aware of the impact 
of these potential scenarios and act quickly and pro­
ficiently to ease the fear, anxiety and trauma for 
pediatric patients in their care. The impact of fear 
and anxiety relating to medical care can persist long 
after the encounter and will influence coping in the 
moment and management of future painful or anxiety 
provoking medical experiences
[31].
COPING AND THE PEDIATRIC PATIENT
Research indicates there is a clear correlation between 
healthcare, hospitalization and coping with anxiety 
for children
[4,5,32­38]. Children’s cognitive development 
prohibits their capacity to define the parameters of an 
event, specific to the duration or intensity
[25,39]. They 
are often inaccurate in their assessment of when an 
event actually occurred
[39]. Because of this, children 
can be triggered into a trauma response by feeling that 
they are experiencing more frequent or severe medical 
care than actually occurred.
Trauma causes increased levels of catecholamines 
(epinephrine and norepinephrine), which results in 
increased sympathetic nervous system activity
[40]. It 
also decreases corticosteroids, and serotonin, which 
results in the inability to moderate the catecholamine­
triggered fight or flight responses
[40]. In children, these 
physiological responses commonly result in dissocia­
tive patterns such as a freeze or surrender response. 
Children may surrender in helplessness, hide from the 
frightening experience, cling to an attachment figure or 
object, be unable to communicate their needs clearly, 
or be overcome with disabling emotion
[40]. 
Coping in children and adults universally includes 
three facets, none of which are one­dimensional: 
(1) active vs avoidant; (2) internal vs external; and 
(3) emotionally­focused vs problem­focused
[36]. 
Researchers
[41] found that avoidant coping is used 
more during the acute phase of healthcare or hos­
pitalization and active coping was used more often in 
the recovery phase. By focusing children’s attention

patient. 
Although these 5 steps may offer respect, com­
munication, appreciation and confidence in the skill 
of the caregiver
, it fails to address a very important 
need in patients ­ emotional containment and support. 
Current research and literature is limited regarding ways 
to reduce healthcare­induced distress. Recognizing 
the unique emotional and relational needs of pediatric 
patients, this author developed a new way for medical 
providers to CARE while interacting with pediatric 
patients: Choices, agenda, resilience and emotional 
support.
CARE: CHOICES
When children are brought into healthcare settings, 
they often feel scared, are often in pain, and are 
expected to adjust to new settings and submit to the 
bewildering array of questions, exams, tests, and 
treatments with little to no preparation. Their largest 
fear is of the unknown
[47,48]. Therefore, it is crucial 
medical professionals take time to explain to the child 
the reason for the treatment in a developmentally­
appropriate manner
. Children need as much control 
and choice as possible
[49,50]. If this informative step is 
not accomplished, anxiety increases. When anxiety 
increases, feelings of helplessness result. Helplessness 
results in lack of cooperation
[48]. Furthermore, trust is 
broken once the child feels anxiety­stricken. Patients 
and their family members are empowered by choice. 
The power­differential is clear and felt between 
patient and provider
. By simply providing develop­
mentally­appropriate choices, anxiety can be reduced 
and emotional containment can be provided to a 
patient. Power through choice­giving in a medical setting 
can seem laborious to medical providers at first, but 
rather simple to implement once there is a common 
understanding of the goal. The goal is to empower 
patients and their families in an effort to provide 
psychological­control of the environment. Surely there 
are circumstances requiring urgent or emergent care, 
but overall, a few extra seconds of choice­giving in 
the moment can go far to reduce perceived or actual 
psychological trauma immediately and in the long­term 
and improve patient cooperation
[4]. Further
, it sets up 
expectations for future episodes of care.
Examples of medical professionals taking power 
from patients include: Requiring the patient take off 
their clothes and get up on the exam table; speaking 
to the parent only, about the child, during the visit; 
choosing the pace and flow of the exam; holding 
children down for injections, venipuncture, intravenous 
fluids starts, or examination; and, prohibiting the 
patient to explore the room, instruments being used, 
or to ask questions. Patients without power are 
immediately vulnerable to increased anxiety and can 
even be triggered into a trauma response. Healthcare 
providers must be cognizant of their power to 
on a specific aspect of medical care, they feel better 
equipped to recover faster than children who are 
avoidant in their experience. This focus introduces 
internal locus of control.
An internal locus of control refers to the belief that 
events or outcomes come as a result of one’s own 
choices and actions; an external locus of control is 
described as less influenced by one’s own choices and 
actions and more predisposed by outside influences
[42]. 
Choosing an internal locus of control correlates positively 
with active coping approaches, such as seeking 
information about the illness or procedure and alertness 
to stressful stimuli
[43,44]. In young children aged 0­2, the 
internal locus of control is associated with attachment 
of the primary caregiver and the child will rely upon 
them for age­appropriate information and for physical 
safety. An external locus of control has been shown to 
be interrelated with avoidant coping strategies, such as 
avoiding information about the event, denying worries, 
and distancing one’s self from stressful stimuli
[43­45]. 
This response is commonly displayed in children with 
a disruptive or avoidant attachment pattern with their 
primary caregiver
. 
As coping behaviors differ from child to child, the 
role of a safe and empowering medical professional 
is all the more important. If a child does not possess 
a strong attachment to their primary caregiver
, such 
as a parent, medical personnel may need to step in 
and offer the child additional assistance in identifying 
their internal locus of control. Choices foster personal 
power to children and can encourage a strong internal 
locus of control. Those that deliver healthcare should 
have awareness and training in how to treat children 
appropriately based on style of coping in hopes of 
decreasing levels of perceived trauma and healthcare­
induced anxiety. 
A NEW WAY TO CARE
When asked, most patients and their family members 
communicate the desire for respect, communica­
tion, appreciation, and confidence in the skill of 
the caregiver. In an effort to meet patient needs 
and increase patient satisfaction with hospital staff 
interaction, Quint Studer of Studer Group
[46] deve­
loped 5 fundamentals of service to increase patient 
satisfaction: (1) Acknowledge: Acknowledge the 
patient by name. Make eye contact. Ask: “Is there 
anything I can do for you?”; (2)
 
Introduce: Introduce 
yourself, your skill set, your professional certification, 
and experience; (3) Duration: Give an accurate time 
expectation for tests, physician arrival, and tray 
delivery; (4) Explanation: Explain step by step what 
will happen, answer questions, and leave a phone 
number where you can be reached; and (5) Thank: 
Thank the patient for choosing your hospital, and 
for their communication and cooperation. Thank the 
family for assistance and being there to support the

potentially cause the medical care process to become 
a traumatic event for patients, regardless of their age 
or developmental stage.
The goal of healthcare providers should be to 
empower patients in their medical care experiences. 
Providing an empowering environment significantly 
decreases a patient’s risk for healthcare­induced trau­
ma and other undesirable psychological effects of 
treatment. Examples of medical professionals offering 
power to a pediatric patient are as follows: Asking the 
patient where they would like the medical provider 
to start the exam (e.g., “Would you like me to listen 
to your heart first or look in your ears first?”); Asking 
the patient which ear they would like to be examined 
first (e.g., “Would you like me to look into your left ear 
or right ear first?”); Letting the patient decide which 
arm is used to measure blood pressure (e.g., “You 
get to decide. Should I squeeze your left arm or your 
right arm to measure how fast your blood is pumping 
through your body?”); Proving small choices about 
seemingly insignificant matters, such as having socks 
on or off (e.g., “You can leave your socks on or off for 
today’s exam. Which do you choose?”); and finally, 
instilling power by normalizing that a patient may 
have questions they wish to be answered (e.g., “What 
questions do you have today?”) Each of these word­
choice examples provides context of how a small shift 
in language can foster empowerment to a patient in a 
medical provider’s care. 
Genital exams can be a potentially trauma­
provoking experience for a child ­especially in children 
with a prior sexual trauma. One in five girls and one 
in twenty boys is a victim of child sexual abuse
[51]. 
Communicating openly and offering choices to the 
patient will go far to create an environment of safety 
and empowerment. Speaking directly to the patient, 
providing the reason for the genital exam, what is 
being assessed, and how it may help will let the 
patient know exactly what to expect. If there are 
several family members present, ask patients whom 
they would like in the room. Wait for permission 
to begin the examination. If necessary, ask for per­
mission to touch the child’s genitals, explaining that 
it’s safe because a parent is present. For example 
during a well­child exam say, “Today I need to check 
your private area to make sure it is growing the way it 
should. I will just take a quick look and I might need 
to feel different places on it to make sure everything is 
okay. Who would you like to be in the room during the 
exam? It’s okay to ask your brother or dad to leave. 
You get to decide… With your mom right here, can I 
begin?”. 
The result is empowerment and emotional safety 
for a child, in a potentially traumatizing situation. 
The physician can set up an environment of trust 
and safety that will serve as a foundation to medical 
care for the rest of the patient’s life. If a physician is 
forceful, uses parents to hold a child down, dismisses 
the child’s fear or fight response-verbally or physically-
without validating the emotions, assumes permission 
to examine the patient’s genitals, or fails to give the 
child power of who was present in the room for the 
examination, there may be a different outcome. 
Choices communicate power and care.
CARE: AGENDA
Fear and anxiety can increase when patients are 
unsure or unprepared for what is going to happen 
in an episode of care. Trauma is a normal response 
to fear
, especially in pediatric patients. In an effort 
to mitigate trauma responses, providers can provide 
their agenda to patients and their families. The agenda 
includes what to expect during the healthcare visit and 
what is expected of them. Introducing detail makes 
the unpredictable, predictable ­ and fear dissipates. 
The benefits are clear
. When patients know what to 
expect and what is expected of them, they feel more 
in control of the situation and are therefore less fearful, 
anxious, and less likely to have trauma responses. 
In outpatient settings, a physician may choose to 
set the agenda in the following manner for a well­child 
exam: “In our time together today we have 20 min…; 
I’m going to talk to you (child) and then talk to your 
dad…; Then I’m going to listen to your heart, and take 
a look inside your ears, nose and mouth…; After I take 
a look at everything, we will discuss other choices that 
need to be made today, such as vaccines…; And then, 
you will get to choose a sticker on the way out!” 
Hospital providers have additional stressors, such 
as urgent and emergent medical conditions to treat 
and manage. With these considerations in mind, the fol­
lowing recommendations should help communication 
with children and their families in inpatient settings: “‘I’m 
going to track how you are breathing and how fast 
your blood is pumping through your body­the process 
is called getting vital signs’; ‘Then I’m going to ask you 
and your mom a lot of questions to get to know you’; 
‘Things move quickly around here. Then suddenly they 
stop. It could feel frustrating to wait’; ‘You may have to 
wait a while for the doctor to come in’; ‘I will ask you to 
change your clothes’; ‘I will hook you up to a machine 
that tracks your breathing­it makes beeping sounds, 
that’s normal’; ‘If the doctor wants to see what’s going 
on inside of your body, I might take a sample of your 
blood and it pinches a bit’. ‘We might go to a special 
room that doesn’t have many lights and take pictures of 
your body. It’s called an X­ray and it’s important to stay 
really still for the pictures’”
. 
Setting the agenda and making expectations 
clear to the patient and their families is a vital 
part of preventing healthcare­induced anxiety and 
trauma responses. Each of the above statements of 
explanation and expectation can act as a preventive 
measure to create emotional and psychological safety 
for pediatric patients and their families. By adding a

few moments of explanation, healthcare providers 
can aid in establishing rapport and trust that will last 
throughout a child’s lifetime of engaging with medical 
professionals. Further
, a few moments of explanation 
on the front end will save time in the long run.
CARE: RESILIENCE
Identifying a patient’s resilience, or strengths, is 
a powerful marker of establishing a trust­filled 
relationship. Beginning a healthcare visit with a pa­
tient’s strengths and identifying how a patient and 
their family have managed other struggles in their life 
immediately fosters rapport and trust. For example: 
“What was helpful when you sought out help for this 
previously?” or “What else should I know about you in 
order to best understand your situation and help you 
today?” “That seems really important to you ­ tell me 
more about it”.
During an evaluation process, by starting with 
a patient’s strengths, a medical professional also 
communicates to the patient that even if there are 
concerns, the provider wants to hear about what is 
good. This may be the only time in the day a child hears 
about their positive qualities. Further
, by asking a parent 
to identify their child’s strengths with the child present, 
it aids to strengthen the parent­child relationship. A note 
of caution, if a child is present in an office visit, which 
they almost always are, providers should limit negative 
talk about the child. For example, night enuresis is a 
shame­filled topic for many school­aged children and 
can be exacerbated by critical evaluation with a medical 
provider
. Further
, behavioral issues, including attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms, can equally be 
shame­inducing topics for children.
A practical way of addressing the issue of concerns 
and problems is instead of asking, “What are your 
concerns and what problems do you have?” ask, “What 
would you like to be different?” There is a therapeutic 
and psychological difference in the way this question 
sounds to and is internalized by a child. Examples 
to empower patients by identifying strengths are as 
follows: “‘Tell me what’s going really well in your life 
right now...’ ‘What are you the most proud of in your 
child?’ ‘What is the best thing in your life?’ ‘What are 
you really, really good at?’ ‘What is the best thing 
about being (child’s) parent?’”
Each of these examples are a quick re­frame of 
common and necessary questions around problems 
and concerns that healthcare providers ask children 
and their caregivers. By starting with strengths and 
re­framing negative talk around the child a healthcare 
provider continues to make actionable principles 
to decrease anxiety and trauma responses in the 
healthcare setting, regardless of what brings the child 
in for medical treatment. Focusing on resilience and 
strengths communicates great respect to a patient and 
family members.
CARE: EMOTIONS
It is common and expected for pediatric patients and 
their families to experience myriad emotions with 
each healthcare encounter
. Medical professionals serve 
their pediatric patients well by making a concerted 
effort to normalize common emotions, including fears. 
By creating freedom for patients to experience and 
convey emotions, the healthcare provider commu­
nicates the patient’s emotions are valuable, worth 
listening to, and creates opportunity for deeper con­
nection in the patient­provider relationship. When 
patients feel understood and validated, they feel safe ­ 
mental health professionals call this relational process 
attunement. Patients want to know everyone feels 
afraid sometimes. Reflect emotions when they are 
observed clearly. Express wonder about emotions that 
are unclear
.
Practically speaking, the following, said in a soft 
and comforting tone of voice, depicts reflecting and 
normalizing emotions in the healthcare setting: 
“‘Sometimes I feel nervous when I meet new people 
too’; ‘It’s okay to feel scared or nervous’; ‘It looks like 
you feel worried’; ‘I wonder if you are feeling afraid or 
unsure’; ‘There’s a lot of sounds here ­ that can feel 
overwhelming’; ‘You look suspicious ­ it’s okay to ask 
me any questions you may have’”.
The effort to emotionally attune with patients 
bolsters their trust in their medical provider
, creates 
safety in the unknown environment, and decreases 
acute anxiety and healthcare­induced trauma. This 
is not always a natural skill and it takes practice to 
reflect emotion accurately and curiously; however, 
the benefits are well worth the effort as it aids in 
the patient­provider relationship for the long­term, 
including increase in patient­experience, which is 
important to all medical providers and health systems. 
CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS OF CARE
As medical providers serve a variety of people from 
numerous cultures and ethnicities, it is important to 
address clinical considerations impacting the CARE 
protocol as it pertains to diversity awareness. Begin by 
identifying the cultural background of the patient. From 
there, what is known about the culture, ethnicity, and 
preferences of the patient? With all multicultural issues, 
medical providers must begin medical relationships 
with a respectful curiosity and an intentional invitation 
to understand differences and similarities. Of note, 
some cultures desire a lot of interaction with their 
providers, others do not. Among other things, some 
patients with differing race or cultural experiences from 
the provider may prefer that the provider assume a 
power position in regard to decision­making and avoid 
collaboration about process and course of treatment. 
Ask patients what needs to be known about their 
values surrounding healthcare.

Healthcare­induced anxiety and trauma can pre­
sent differently in varying cultures. Some cultures 
celebrate emotional awareness and attunement; and 
equally, some cultures shun emotional awareness 
and attunement. It is important to recognize these 
values in one’s patient population and to be cautious 
in implementing protocols and interventions that 
could cause more emotional distress to a patient. 
When in doubt, ask the patient. Patients and their 
family members are often more than happy to provide 
context and information surrounding their values and 
definition of excellent medical care. 
CONCLUSION
Pediatric patients require an extra level of care in their 
healthcare process. They require added patience, 
flexibility, and containment for their ever­changing 
emotions. Their primary need is to know they are safe 
and to be given age­appropriate and developmentally­
appropriate information in order to combat heightened 
anxiety levels and trauma responses, which can hinder 
the delivery of quality healthcare and create harmful 
long­term psychological effects. Healthcare providers 
have a valuable opportunity to control the negative 
outcome of pediatric stress in the medical setting, no 
matter their function in a child’s episode of care. By 
utilizing the four principles in the CARE protocol: (1) 
Choices: Provide power in a powerless environment; 
(2) Agenda: Letting the patient and family know 
what to expect and what is expected of them; (3) 
Resilience: Start with strengths and reframe negatives; 
and (4) Emotions: Recognize and normalize common 
fears and responses providing emotional support, 
children will feel emotionally safe and protected in their 
medical treatment. 
Understanding the risk of anxiety and trauma in 
pediatric patients with regard to receiving medical care 
is imperative to effective outcomes. Although universal 
application can be made to patients throughout the 
lifespan, the mission of CARE is to provide a voice 
to the world’s most vulnerable, powerless, and 
disregarded population in medical care­children. The 
CARE protocol was developed to foster trust in medical 
care providers and to mitigate the risk of anxiety and 
trauma in pediatric patients while receiving necessary 
and pertinent medical care. Most patients remember 
how they feel about an episode of care, not what was 
said or done. CARE enough to allow pediatric patients 
to feel empowered and safe in their healthcare 
experience.
