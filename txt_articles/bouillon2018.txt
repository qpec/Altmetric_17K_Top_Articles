IMPORTANCE Safety of hysteroscopic sterilization has been recently questioned following
reports of general symptoms such as allergy, tiredness, and depression in addition to
associated gynecological results such as pelvic pain, perforation of fallopian tubes or uterus,
and unwanted pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE To compare the risk of reported adverse events between hysteroscopic and
laparoscopic sterilization.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS French nationwide cohort study using the national
hospital discharge database linked to the health insurance claims database. Women aged 30
to 54 years receiving a first hysteroscopic or laparoscopic sterilization between 2010 and
2014 were included and were followed up through December 2015.
EXPOSURES Hysteroscopic sterilization vs laparoscopic sterilization.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risks of procedural complications (surgical and medical)
and of gynecological (sterilization failure that includes salpingectomy, second sterilization
procedure, or pregnancy; pregnancy; reoperation) and medical outcomes (all types of allergy;
autoimmune diseases; thyroid disorder; use of analgesics, antimigraines, antidepressants,
benzodiazepines; outpatient visits; sickness absence; suicide attempts; death) that occurred
within 1 and 3 years after sterilization were compared using inverse probability of
treatment–weighted Cox models.
RESULTS Of the 105 357 women included (95.5% of eligible participants; mean age, 41.3 years
[SD, 3.7 years]), 71 303 (67.7% ) underwent hysteroscopic sterilization, and 34 054 (32.3%)
underwent laparoscopic sterilization. During the hospitalization for sterilization, risk of surgical
complications for hysteroscopic sterilization was lower: 0.13% for hysteroscopic sterilization vs
0.78% for laparoscopic sterilization (adjusted risk difference [RD], −0.64; 95% CI, −0.67 to
−0.60) and was lower for medical complications: 0.06% vs 0.11% (adjusted RD, −0.05; 95% CI,
−0.08 to −0.01). During the first year after sterilization, 4.83% of women who underwent
hysteroscopic sterilization had a higher risk of sterilization failure than the 0.69% who
underwent laparoscopic sterilization (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 7.11; 95% CI, 5.92 to 8.54;
adjusted RD, 4.23 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 3.40 to 5.22). Additionally, 5.65% of women
who underwent hysteroscopic sterilization required gynecological reoperation vs 1.76% of
women who underwent laparoscopic sterilization (adjusted HR, 3.26; 95% CI, 2.90 to 3.67;
adjusted RD, 4.63 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 3.38 to 4.75); these differences persisted after
3 years, although attenuated. Hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with a lower risk of
pregnancy within the first year of the procedure but was not significantly associated with a
difference in risk of pregnancy by the third year (adjusted HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.30; adjusted
RD, 0.01 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, −0.04 to 0.07). Risks of medical outcomes were not
significantly increased with hysteroscopic sterilization compared with laparoscopic sterilization.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women undergoing first sterilization, the use of
hysteroscopic sterilization was significantly associated with higher risk of gynecological
complications over 1 year and over 3 years than was laparoscopic sterilization. Risk of medical
outcomes was not significantly increased over 1 year or over 3 years. These findings do not
support increased medical risks associated with hysteroscopic sterilization.

n developed countries, 2 main types of female steriliza-
tion are available: laparoscopic and hysteroscopic steril-
ization, the latter performed using Essure (Bayer)
implants marketed since 2002. This device, a 4-cm-long
nitinol coil, is implanted in both fallopian tubes during a
hysteroscopic procedure. Approximately 1 million women
have undergone this procedure worldwide.1,2 The main
advantages of hysteroscopic sterilization are that the inser-
tion does not necessitate general anesthesia nor does it
carry the risks related to laparoscopy. However, it becomes
effective when occlusive tubal fibrosis occurs 3 months fol-
lowing insertion. This leads to 2 constraints: women must
use contraception and undergo an examination to confirm
that the implants remained correctly placed at 3 months. In
the United States, such examination is performed using hys-
terosalpingogram. In France, a pelvic x-ray was recom-
mended until 2016. Placement was considered satisfactory
when both devices appeared to be within the tubal lumen,
had a symmetrical appearance, and the distance between
the intrauterine ends was no more than 4 cm. If it was
inconclusive, a pelvic ultrasound was performed with
recourse to hysterosalpingogram if necessary.
Safety concerns related to hysteroscopic sterilization
were raised in the United States in 2015 by women who
reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
large numbers of adverse events including bleeding, perfora-
tion of fallopian tubes or uterus, unwanted pregnancy, hys-
terectomies, abdominal pain, migraine, depression, suicide
attempts, allergy or hypersensitivity reactions, autoimmune
diseases, thyroid disorder, and death.2,3 These concerns
have also been reported in other countries,4-6 including
France, the country with the second largest number of
women using this method after the United States.
To investigate a possible role of hysteroscopic steri-
lization in these events, a comparative design is needed.2
Four published studies7-10 compared procedural and
gynecological outcomes between hysteroscopic and lap-
aroscopic sterilization, but none of them examined non-
gynecological outcomes.
To compare the risk of reported events between hystero-
scopic and laparoscopic sterilization, a French nationwide co-
hort study was conducted.
Methods
Data Sources
The national hospital discharge database (Programme
de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'
Information [PMSI])
and health insurance claim database (Système National
d’Information Inter-Régimes de l’Assurance Maladie
[SNIIRAM]) contain information on at least 99% of the
French population. Health insurance is divided into various
coverage plans based on individuals’ occupational status.
The general insurance coverage provides exhaustive informa-
tion on health care use and vital status of approximately 75%
of the French population. Various pharmacoepidemiological
studies have already used these databases.11-23
The PMSI database contains details of all admissions,
outpatient appointments, and accident and emergency
attendances at all public and private hospitals in France.
It contains dates of hospital admission and discharge, dis-
charge diagnoses coded in the International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth
Revision (ICD-10), and type of medical or surgical acts
including imaging procedures coded using a common classi-
fication of medical procedures (Classification Commune des
Actes Médicaux [CCAM]). An anonymous, unique identifier
for each subject links PMSI information to the SNIIRAM
database.
The SNIIRAM database contains individual data on all
reimbursements for patients’ health expenditures including
medicinal products and outpatient medical care, prescribed
or provided by health care professionals.
There is no formal clinical validation of the SNIIRAM
and PMSI data. In France, all individuals have a lifelong
social security number, which is needed every time an indi-
vidual seeks health care services. The reimbursement pro-
cedure is automated through the social security card, Carte
Vitale. In addition, hospital data are collected, validated,
and transmitted to paying and controlling institutions by
physicians working in private and public hospitals. There-
fore, data used in this study are exhaustive and can be con-
sidered accurate.
This study was approved by the French Data Protec-
tion Supervisory Authority (Commission Nationale de
l’Informatique et des Libertés), which did not require in-
formed consent because data are anonymized.
Study Population
Women were included in the study if they had undergone a
first hysteroscopic or laparoscopic sterilization between
2010 and 2014 based on CCAM (JJPE001 for hysteroscopic
and JJPC003 for laparoscopic sterilization) and ICD-10 codes
(Z30.2: encounter for sterilization), were between 30 and 54
years old, and were registered in the general insurance cov-
erage program. To restrict the study population to women
Key Points
Question Are there clinically important risks associated with
hysteroscopic sterilization compared with laparoscopic
sterilization?
Findings In this cohort study of 105 357 women who
underwent a first sterilization, the use of hysteroscopic
sterilization was significantly associated with lower immediate
risk of procedural complications than laparoscopic sterilization
(0.13% vs 0.78% for surgical complications and 0.06% vs 0.11%
for medical complications); and higher risk of gynecological
complications with 4.83% vs 0.69% for sterilization failure
and 5.65% vs 1.76% for gynecological reoperation over 1 year;
these differences persisted over 3 years, although attenuated.
Risk of medical outcomes was not significantly increased over
1 year or over 3 years.
Meaning These findings do not support an increased risk of
medical outcomes related to hysteroscopic sterilization.

 primarily seeking tubal sterilization, we excluded women
who (1) were pregnant or had given birth within 3 months,
(2) had been recently diagnosed with a cancer (<1 year prior
to inclusion), (3) were receiving fertility treatments, (4) had
a mastectomy or salpingectomy along with the sterilization
procedure, and (5) had a delay of more than 1 day between
the date of hospital admission and the date of the steriliza-
tion procedure. Women who had not received health care
within the 3 years following the sterilization procedure
(who possibly had incomplete information) were also
excluded. Detailed definitions on exclusion criteria are
described in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Outcomes Definition and Identification
Outcomes included procedural (surgical and medical) com-
plications occurring during their hospital stay for the steril-
ization procedure and gynecological and medical outcomes
events occurring at the 1-year and 3-year follow-up. Detailed
definition of outcome variables are described in eTables 2
through 7 in the Supplement.
Procedural surgical complications included acute hem-
orrhage, abdominal injury, complications related to the
placement of a prosthesis or implant, debridement, evacua-
tion, ablation of a foreign body, and other surgical complica-
tions. Procedural medical complications included acute
myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest, stroke, peripheral
arterial thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis or pulmo-
nary embolism, anesthetic or anaphylactic shock, respira-
tory complications, infection, and death.
Gynecological events were categorized as tubal disorder
or surgery (complications related to the placement of a pros-
thesis or implant, or salpingectomy), uterine disorder (hys-
terectomy, genital hemorrhage, endometrectomy or curet-
tage, or myomectomy), second sterilization procedure
(hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, other types of sterilization),
and pregnancy. Two composite gynecological outcomes
were also defined: sterilization failure (including salpingec-
tomy, second sterilization procedure, and pregnancy) and
reoperation (including salpingectomy, hysterectomy, endo-
metrectomy or curettage, myomectomy, or second steriliza-
tion procedure). Individual components of composite out-
comes were also examined.
Based on safety concerns reported to the FDA,2,3 medi-
cal outcomes included allergic reactions (diagnosed during
a hospital stay; desensitized; tested using a patch test, prick
test, or intradermal reaction test; or treated with an antihis-
tamine); autoimmune diseases (including demyelinating
diseases of the central nervous system; Guillain-Barré syn-
drome; cutaneous or systemic lupus; localized or systemic
scleroderma; vasculitis; rheumatoid or juvenile arthritis;
myositis, polymyositis, or dermatomyositis; Gougerot-
Sjögren syndrome; idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura;
chronic inflammatory bowel disease; celiac disease; type 1
diabetes; and pancreatitis); thyroid disorders; use of analge-
sics, antimigraines, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines
(as defined by at least 2 annual reimbursements for antihis-
tamines and analgesics, and at least 2 reimbursements dur-
ing follow-up for antimigraines, antidepressants, and ben-
zodiazepines); suicide attempts; and death. Outcomes also
included the number of physician office and outpatient vis-
its and the number of days missed from work due to sick-
ness or injury.
Covariates
Detailed definitions of covariates are described in eTable 7
in the Supplement. Sociodemographic characteristics
included age, supplementary universal health coverage
(supplementary insurance free of charge for people with a
low income), and social deprivation index (level of depriva-
tion in an area).24
Variables on lifestyle, medical, surgical, and gynecologi-
cal history were defined using information collected dur-
ing the 5-year period preceding the date of sterilization
except for nonintrauterine contraceptive methods (1 reim-
bursement within 1 year prior to the inclusion). Lifestyle
variables included alcohol abuse and tobacco and psychoac-
tive substance use. Medical and surgical history included
diabetes, obesity, circulatory system disease, allergy
(allergy diagnosed during a hospital stay; desensitized;
tested using a patch test, prick test, or intradermal reaction
test; or treated with an antihistamine), autoimmune dis-
ease, thyroid disorder, nongynecological cancers, suicide
attempts, and abdominal surgery. Gynecological history
included breast cancer, gynecological cancer, gynecological
surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease, noninflammatory
pelvic disorder, congenital malformation of the uterus or
cervix, endometrectomy or curettage, leiomyoma of the
uterus, diagnostic or therapeutic hysteroscopy, pregnancy,
and contraceptive method (oral contraceptive pill, trans-
dermal patch, vaginal ring, subdermal implant, or intrauter-
ine device).
Consumption of analgesics (opioids, nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, or other), antimigraines, antifibrinolyt-
ics, oral irons, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and oral
corticosteroids were each defined by the existence of at
least 2 reimbursements within the 6-month period preced-
ing the date of sterilization.
Characteristics of the sterilization procedure included
status of hospital (public or private), region of hospital loca-
tion, anesthetic procedure (including intravenous sedation
or local, regional, or general anesthesia), duration of hospi-
tal stay, level of experience with sterilization procedures of
the hospital and physician (number of hysteroscopic or
laparoscopic sterilizations within the year prior to date of
sterilization). A physician’s level of experience was esti-
mated for private hospitals for which an anonymous physi-
cian’s unique identifiers were linked to patients’ data. This
information was not available for public hospitals.
Statistical Analysis
The frequency of the various outcomes was compared
between women with hysteroscopic and laparoscopic steril-
ization. Multivariable logistic regression was used to study
procedural complications occurring during the hospitaliza-
tion for sterilization providing adjusted odds ratios (ORs)
with 95% CIs. Assumptions of logistic regression models

 were verified as follows: fit of the models was tested using
the Hosmer-Lemeshow test; multicolinearity was assessed
calculating variance inflation factors; all interactions terms
between sterilization and covariates were tested; and over-
fitting was assessed using a backward selection procedure.
Overall, these assumptions were met. Cox proportional haz-
ards regression models were used for outcomes occurring at
1 and 3 years of follow-up providing adjusted hazard ratios
(HRs) with 95% CIs. The proportional hazards assumption
for the Cox models was assessed for studied outcomes by
(1) testing interaction term type of sterilization × log (follow-
up) and (2) graphically drawing curves log (−log [survival])
vs survival time. Except for uterine disorder, the propor-
tional assumption was met. For this outcome, a multivari-
able logistic regression was conducted to verify that the
adjusted OR (95% CIs) were close to the adjusted HR (95%
CIs) found using the Cox model. Patients were followed up
from the hospital discharge date after sterilization through
the date of the occurrence of the event of interest for those
experiencing this event. Those without such an event were
censored on the date of the following events, whichever
came first: the date of maximal time of follow-up, death, or
December 31, 2015.
To account for differences between the comparison
groups, models were adjusted for baseline covariates
including age, medical (gynecological and nongynecologi-
cal) history, and medication use and were weighted for
inverse probability of treatment weighting using a propen-
sity score for 11 characteristics related to women (supple-
mentary universal health coverage, index of deprivation,
indicators of alcoholism and of tobacco use, obesity, diabe-
tes, history of psychoactive substance use, and suicide
attempts) and related to sterilization sites (region of hospital
location [n = 26], status of hospital (public or private), and
hospital’s level of experience with sterilization procedures
(number of hysteroscopic or laparoscopic sterilizations
within the year prior to date of sterilization categorized
into quintiles). The inverse probability of treatment weight-
ing using the propensity score was applied to account
for indication bias. The propensity score was the prob-
ability that a woman received either hysteroscopic or lapa-
roscopic sterilization calculated using logistic regression
considering the aforementioned covariates.25 To assess the
balance of individual covariates before and after inverse
probability of treatment weighting, standardized differ-
ences were calculated as the difference in means or propor-
tions divided by the pooled standard deviation. The negli-
gible difference was defined as an absolute standardized
difference of less than 0.1.26
A sensitivity analysis was conducted examining com-
posite gynecological outcomes (sterilization failure and
reoperation) without salpingectomy because this interven-
tion could have been performed along with laparoscopic
sterilization for ovarian cancer prevention as promoted
by North American Obstetricians and Gynecologists
since 2013.27
The adjusted risk difference (RD), or difference in the
cumulative incidence of gynecological and medical out-
comes at 1 and 3 years of follow-up between hysteroscopic
and laparoscopic groups was calculated as (adjusted
HR−1) × unadjusted incidence rate per 100 person-years in
the laparoscopic group. The 95% CIs were calculated analo-
gously. For procedural (surgical and medical) complications,
adjusted RDs (95% CIs) were estimated similarly replacing
adjusted HR by an adjusted OR, which can be a good
approximation of an adjusted HR when an outcome of inter-
est is rare.
Interactions with the following covariates were tested:
age, medical history related to studied outcome, and allergy
history.
Because exhaustive and systematically collected data
were analyzed, use of a technique to account for missing
values at baseline was unnecessary. Missing information on
follow-up was handled by excluding women with no health
care use within the 3 years following the sterilization proce-
dure. This criterion concerned only 322 women (0.29%) of
the initial population.
Because of the large number of end points assessed and
analyses conducted, the potential for type I error for posi-
tive findings needs to be considered in their interpretation.
All analyses were performed using SAS software, ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Statistical significance was
defined as P <.05; all alternative hypotheses were 2-sided.
Results
Of 110 299 eligible women who underwent a primary tubal
sterilization procedure between January 2010 and Decem-
ber 2014, 105 357 (95.5%) were included: 71 303 (67.7%)
underwent hysteroscopic and 34 054 (32.3%) laparoscopic
sterilization. Of the possible reasons for exclusion, 4942
women (4.5%) met at least 1 of exclusion criterion: obstetric
history 3 months prior to inclusion (n = 2505), a history
of recent cancer (n = 1794), a delay between date of hos-
pital admission for sterilization and date of sterilization
of more than a day (n = 177), a concomitant mastectomy
(n = 63) or salpingectomy (n = 131) at time of sterilization, or
not using health care services for 3 or more years after steril-
ization (n = 322).
Women in the hysteroscopic sterilization group were
slightly older (mean [SD] age, 41.5 years [3.5] vs 40.8 [3.9]),
had a higher socioeconomic status, a more healthful life-
style, more likely to have diabetes, and more likely to
be obese; less likely to have a history of allergy, suicide
attempts, gynecological history, and prior pregnancy and
were less likely to use an intrauterine contraceptive device
(Table 1). Prior to inclusion, the hysteroscopic group con-
sumed few medications, consulted a general practitioner
less often (mean [SD] number of consultations, 5.27 [4.9] vs
5.69 [5.2]) but consulted a gynecologist more often (mean
[SD], 1.56 [1.5] vs 1.51 [1.5]) and had a lower mean number of
sick days than did those in the laparoscopic group (mean
[SD], 7.0 [27.4]) vs 8.1 [30.3]). Although these characteristics
were statistically different, their absolute difference in per-
centages or means were small. eTable 8 in the Supplement

 summarizes the balance of covariates between groups
before and after applying inverse probability of treatment
weighting. All covariates included in the inverse probability
of treatment–weighting analysis were well-balanced in both
groups (standardized differences value <0.1). This was also
the case for all other covariates not included in inverse
probability of treatment weighting analysis except for pelvic
inflammatory disease (standardized differences value,
0.112). This small difference was taken into account in mul-
tivariable analyses because this variable was systematically
adjusted for.
The sterilization procedures of women included in the
study were conducted in 831 hospitals located throughout
all 26 French regions. Hospitals in which hysteroscopic ster-
ilization had been performed differed from those in which
laparoscopic sterilization had been performed in terms of
status (58.2% public for hysteroscopic sterilization vs 55.9%
public for laparoscopic sterilization), level of experience in
hysteroscopic sterilization (median number performed dur-
ing the preceding year, 60 vs 36, respectively) (Table 2), and
region (eTable 9 in the Supplement).
Overall, 105 318 women (99.96%) were followed-up for at
least 1 year and 54 232 (51.5%) for at least 3 years. The mean
(SD) follow-up time up to 3 years was 2.5 years (0.6 years).
Procedural Complications
At the time of the procedure, inhospital surgical complica-
tions occurred in 0.13% of women in hysteroscopic and 0.78%
in laparoscopic groups.
Medical complications occurred in 0.06% in hystero-
scopic and 0.11% in laparoscopic group.
In multivariable analysis, hysteroscopic sterilization was
associated with a significantly lower risk of surgical compli-
cations than was laparoscopic sterilization (adjusted OR, 0.18;
95% CI, 0.14 to 0.23; adjusted RD, −0.64; 95% CI, −0.67 to
−0.60) and medical (adjusted OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.89;
adjusted RD, −0.05; 95% CI, −0.08 to −0.01) complications of
thesterilizationprocedure.Descriptionofeachconditionispro-
vided in Table 3. No deaths occurred during the sterilization
procedure in either group.
Gynecologic Outcomes
At the 1-year follow-up, the risk of tubal disorder or surgery,
complications related to the placement of a prosthesis or
implant, or salpingectomy, was 0.70% in women who
underwent hysteroscopic sterilization and 0.23% in women
who underwent laparoscopic sterilization; these disorders
were mostly salpingectomies (Table 4). After adjustment,
hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with a signifi-
cantly higher risk of tubal disorder or surgery than was lapa-
roscopic sterilization (adjusted HR, 2.98; 95% CI, 2.17 to
4.10; adjusted RD, 0.47 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 0.28
to 0.73). This heightened risk persisted at the 3-year
follow-up although was less pronounced (Table 4).
Hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with a signifi-
cantly lower risk of uterine disorder at 1 year than was lapa-
roscopic sterilization (1.28% vs 1.50%; adjusted HR, 0.85;
95% CI, 0.74 to 0.98; adjusted RD, −0.23 per 100 person-
years; 95% CI, −0.39 to −0.03), with fewer hysterectomies
and fewer occurrences of genital hemorrhage but with more
myomectomies (Table 4). This lower risk of uterine disorder
persisted at 3 years (Table 4).

 Hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with a signifi-
cantly higher risk of a women undergoing a second steriliza-
tion procedure at 1 year than was laparoscopic sterilization
(4.10% vs 0.16%; adjusted HR, 25.99; 95% CI, 17.84-37.86;
adjusted RD, 4.11 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 2.77-6.07).
Among 2955 women in the hysteroscopic group who under-
went a second sterilization, 65.4% had a laparoscopic steril-
ization and 35.5% another hysteroscopic sterilization for
their second procedure; among 56 women in the laparo-
scopic group who underwent a second sterilization, 84%
had a laparocopic sterilization, 9% hysteroscopic steriliza-
tion, and 7% minilaparotomy (Table 4).
Hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with a signifi-
cantly lower risk of pregnancy at 1 year than was laparo-
scopic sterilization (0.24% vs 0.41%; adjusted HR, 0.70;
95% CI, 0.53 to 0.92; adjusted RD, −0.12 per 100 person-
years; 95% CI, −0.19 to −0.03). However, this difference was
no longer significant at 3 years (0.48% vs 0.57%; adjusted
HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.30; adjusted RD, 0.001 per 100
person-years; 95% CI, −0.04 to 0.07). In the hysteroscopic
group, women who did not complete a confirmation test
compared with those who did were more likely to be preg-
nant at the 1-year follow-up (0.28% vs 0.16%; adjusted HR,
1.49; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.19; adjusted RD, 0.08 per 100 person-
years; 95% CI, 0.002 to 0.19) (eTable 10 in the Supplement);
and, women whose practitioners performed fewer than 12
procedures in the preceding year than practitioners who
performed 12 or more were more likely to be pregnant at the
1-year follow-up (eTable 11 in the Supplement).
Hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with a signifi-
cantly higher risk of sterilization failure after 1 year (4.83%
vs 0.69%; adjusted HR, 7.11; 95% CI, 5.92 to 8.54; adjusted
RD, 4.23 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 3.40 to 5.22) and
after 3 years than was laparoscopic sterilization (5.75% vs
1.29%; adjusted HR, 4.66; 95% CI, 4.06 to 5.34; adjusted
RD, 1.87 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 1.56 to 2.22).
This was also the case with the risk of reoperation after 1
and 3 years (Table 4). When salpingectomy was removed
from these composite outcomes, adjusted HRs at 1 year of
follow-up increased from 7.11 to 8.57 (95% CI, 6.93 to 10.61;
adjusted RD, 3.86 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 3.02 to
4.90) for sterilization failure and from 3.26 to 3.28 (95% CI,
2.90 to 3.71; adjusted RD, 3.68 per 100 person-years; 95%
CI, 3.07 to 4.38) for reoperation.
Medical Outcomes
Hysteroscopic sterilization compared with laparoscopic
sterilization did not significantly differ in the risks of auto-
immune diseases (overall and by type) and in thyroid disor-
ders at both time points (Table 5). Details of autoimmune
diseases are provided in eTable 12 in the Supplement.
Hysteroscopic compared with laparoscopic sterilization
did not nonsignificantly differ in the risk of allergy at either
the 1 year or 3 year follow-up (Table 5). However, results

 differed according to allergy history (P value for interac-
tion = .001): in women who had prior allergies, hystero-
scopic sterilization was associated with a significantly
higher risk of developing an allergic reaction during
follow-up than laparoscopic sterilization (43.20% vs
40.00%; adjusted HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.17; adjusted
RD, 5.86 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 1.76 to 9.96 at 1 year;
and 37.70% vs 34.60%; adjusted HR, 1.10; 95%CI, 1.03 to
1.18; adjusted RD, 2.00 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 0.60
to 3.59 at 3 years) whereas risk of allergies among women
who did not have prior allergies did not differ (eTable 13 in
the Supplement).
Hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with lower
use of analgesics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines
at 1 year than was laparoscopic sterilization (Table 5). This
lower risk was slightly more pronounced at 3 years. Hystero-
scopic sterilization was associated with a higher risk of
using antimigraines at 1 year than was laparoscopic steriliza-
tion, but this difference was no longer significant at 3 years
(Table 5).
Hysteroscopic compared with laparoscopic sterilization
did not differ significantly in the risk of attempted suicide at
1 year (0.20% vs 0.29%; adjusted HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.59 to
1.11; adjusted RD, −0.06 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, −0.12
to 0.03) but had a lower risk at 3 years (0.55% vs 0.79%;
adjusted HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.97; adjusted RD, −0.06
per 100 person-years; 95% CI, −0.11 to −0.01). The risk of
death was not significantly different between these groups
whatever the length of follow-up (Table 5).
Hysteroscopic sterilization had a lower mean number of
physician office or outpatient visits than laparoscopic steril-
ization at 1 year (8.63 vs 9.11; mean difference, −0.48; 95% CI,
−0.58to−0.38;Pvalue<.001)and3years(20.74vs22.39;mean
difference, −1.65; 95% CI, −1.90 to −1.40; P value <.001) and
fewer number of sick days (5.90 vs 6.50 at the 1-year follow-
up; mean difference, −0.60; 95% CI, −0.93 to −0.27; P value
<.001; and, 28.3 vs 32.3 at the 3-year follow-up, mean differ-
ence, −4.00; 95% CI, −5.21 to −2.79; P value <.001) (eTable 14
in the Supplement).
Subgroups Analyses
A significant interaction with allergy history was found and
the results of subgroup analysis are described above. Other
interaction terms were not significant and results of sub-
group analyses are presented in the Figure and in eTables 15
through 17 and the eFigure in the Supplement.
Discussion
Among women undergoing their first sterilization, the use
of hysteroscopic vs laparoscopic sterilization was associated
with lower risk of procedural (surgical and medical) compli-
cations and higher risk of gynecological complications over

 1 or 3 years. In absolute terms, RDs were very small for pro-
cedural complications (−0.64% and −0.05% for surgical and
medical complications, respectively) and more important
for gynecological complications with 4.23 and 1.87 per 100
person-years’ excess sterilization failure and 4.63 and 1.46
per 100 person-years’ excess gynecological reoperation over
1 and 3 years, respectively. Risks of a wide range of medical
outcomes were not significantly increased over 1 or 3 years.
Four studies comparing women with hysteroscopic vs
laparoscopic sterilization were published between 2014 and
2017.7-10 The present results regarding procedural (surgical
and medical) complications8 and gynecological outcomes7-10
are consistent with these studies. Regarding the risk of preg-
nancy, these studies provided inconsistent results when hys-
teroscopic sterilization was compared with laparoscopic
sterilization: Perkins et al9 reported a higher pregnancy risk,
Fernandez et al7 a lower risk, and Mao et al8 a not signifi-
cantly different risk with the pregnancy rate at 1 year varying
between 0.2% to 2.0%. In the present study, the frequency
of pregnancy following hysteroscopic sterilization was lower
within the first year following sterilization (potentially in
relation with the recommendation of maintaining contracep-
tion during the first 3 months after hysteroscopic steriliza-
tion, until the occlusive fibrosis is obtained), this difference
was no longer significant over 3 years. A second sterilization
procedure following hysteroscopic sterilization is a well-
identified risk already described in phase 228 and 329 studies,
in which the risk varied between 4.0% and 4.5%. In the pres-
ent study, this risk was 4.1% at the 1-year follow-up, compa-
rable with that reported in previous studies conducted in
real-life conditions in patients who received care in public or
private hospitals8,9,30-33 and much higher than after laparo-
scopic sterilization.
Consistent with Perkins et al,9 hysteroscopic steriliza-
tion was associated with a lower risk of hysterectomy than
was laparoscopic sterilization after adjustment for known
risk factors for hysterectomy (history of leiomyoma of
uterus, genital bleeding, pelvic inflammatory disease, non-
inflammatory pelvic disorder). Chronic pelvic pain is also an
important risk factor to consider.34 To approximate this, in
addition to the adjusted risk factors mentioned above, a
proxy variable such as analgesics (opioids, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, or others) use was also taken into
account. In addition, an increased risk of hysterectomy in
women with laparoscopic sterilization compared with
women of same age but who had not undergone steriliza-
tion has been reported as well.35-38
To our knowledge, this is the first study aiming at com-
paring medical outcomes in addition to gynecological
outcomes between hysteroscopic and laparoscopic steri-
lization. Thanks to the multiple information provided
by health care databases (causes of hospitalization, reim-
bursed drugs, medical or surgical acts, physician visits, days
of sickness absence), a wide range of outcomes correspond-
ing to the heterogeneous nature of notified complaints
could be examined.
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of hystero-
scopic sterilization, the FDA has ordered the manufacturer
to conduct a study comparing outcomes between women
receiving hysteroscopic and laparoscopic sterilization. The
results of an open-label, nonrandomized, prospective
cohort of 2800 (1400 per group) women are expected in
2023.39 Overall, our study was able to timely respond to
issues raised by the FDA and by others who have debated
hysteroscopic sterilization.
Limitations
This observational study has several limitations. First, to
investigate a possible role of hysteroscopic sterilization in
notified complaints, administrative databases were used.
Therefore, all individual disorders reported by patients or
physicians and collected into medical device vigilance data-
bases could not be examined. To take into account the dif-
ferent nature of complaints, both specific (gynecological
events, allergy, autoimmune diseases, thyroid disorders,
suicide attempts, death) and unspecific (use of analgesics,
antimigraines, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines; phy-
sician visits; sick day absences) outcomes were studied.
Despite the examination of numerous and heterogeneous
outcomes, the present findings do not support the concern
that increased medical risks are associated with hystero-
scopic sterilization. However, the upper limits of the 95%
CIs around the adjusted RDs for the nonstatistically signifi-
cant associations varied between −0.48 and 1.07 per 100
person-years (Table 4 and Table 5). If a clinically important
difference is not considered to be included within these val-
ues, power should not be a concern.
Although a subgroup analysis found a significantly in-
creased allergy risk in the subgroup of women who had aller-
gies, the combination of a null overall effect and large num-
ber of tested interactions makes this finding very tenuous; it
should be considered only hypothesis generating.
Second, the risk of salpingectomy may have been
underestimated in the laparoscopic group because salpin-
gectomy could have been performed during the first steril-
ization. However, this may not be the case because opportu-
nistic salpingectomy for ovarian cancer prevention in
France was rarely conducted during the period of inclusion
(2010-2014).40 In addition, the overall conclusion on gyne-
cological outcomes did not change when composite out-
comes were examined without salpingectomy: adjusted HR
at the 1-year follow-up increased from 7.11 to 8.57 for steril-
ization failure and from 3.26 to 3.28 for reoperation, con-
firming that gynecological outcomes were still worse with
hysteroscopic than with laparoscopic sterilization.
Third, in this study, it was not possible to assess the for-
mal validity of the ICD-10 diagnoses for outcomes of the
PMSI database compared with a medical review and adjudi-
cation. Although it is not available, information on hospital
stay such as causes of hospitalization is accurate and precise
because such data are used to allocate the budgets to both
public and private hospitals; therefore, the quality of diag-
nostic codes from these data are regularly checked against
patients’ medical records. Moreover, when comparative
results exist in the literature, the present findings were con-
sistent with those found in the previous studies as dis-

 cussed above: similar incidence of pregnancy to that found
by Fernandez et al,7 comparative baseline characteristics
between hysteroscopic and laparoscopic groups close to
that in the study by Perkins et al,9 and most importantly
same direction of association for procedural and gyneco-
logical outcomes.7-10
Fourth, only women with the general insurance cover-
age were included. This may question generalizability of
the present results. However, because this covers 75% of the
French population, these findings are likely to be generaliz-
able, and it is unlikely that the present findings were
affected by selection bias, in particular by geographic vari-
ability, which was also considered for these analyses. In
addition, to further avoid selection bias and to render base-
line characteristics more comparable between comparison
groups, exclusion criteria had been applied (n = 4942; 4.5%
of initial population) and the inverse probability of treat-
ment weighting using the propensity score was performed
making comparison groups well balanced. However,
residual selection bias and confounding effect of unmea-
sured or unknown factors cannot be ruled out.
Conclusions
Among women undergoing first sterilization, the use of hys-
teroscopicsterilizationwassignificantlyassociatedwithhigher
risk of gynecological complications over 1 year and over 3 years
than was laparoscopic sterilization. Risk of medical out-
comes was not significantly increased over 1 year or over 3
years. These findings do not support increased medical risks
associated with hysteroscopic sterilization.
