abstract
CONTEXT: Whether 100% fruit juice consumption causes weight gain in children remains 
controversial.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between 100% fruit juice consumption and change in 
BMI or BMI z score in children.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases.
STUDY SELECTION: Longitudinal studies examining the association of 100% fruit juice and change 
in BMI measures were included.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers extracted data using a predesigned data 
collection form.
RESULTS: Of the 4657 articles screened, 8 prospective cohort studies (n = 34 470 individual 
children) met the inclusion criteria. Controlling for total energy intake, 1 daily 6- to 8-oz 
serving increment of 100% fruit juice was associated with a 0.003 (95% CI: 0.001 to 
0.004) unit increase in BMI z score over 1 year in children of all ages (0% increase in BMI 
percentile). In children ages 1 to 6 years, 1 serving increment was associated with a 0.087 
(95% confidence interval: 0.008 to 0.167) unit increase in BMI z score (4% increase in BMI 
percentile). 100% fruit juice consumption was not associated with BMI z score increase in 
children ages 7 to 18 years.
LIMITATIONS: All observational studies; studies differed in exposure assessment and covariate 
adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of 100% fruit juice is associated with a small amount of weight 
gain in children ages 1 to 6 years that is not clinically significant, and is not associated with 
weight gain in children ages 7 to 18 years. More studies are needed in children ages 1 to 
6 years.

Experts have expressed concerns 
that the high content of naturally 
occurring sugars in 100% fruit juice 
may cause negative health effects 
similar to those of sugar-sweetened 
beverages. 
1, 
 
2 The sugars in 100% 
fruit juice are broken down and 
absorbed as glucose and fructose 
and are nutritionally equivalent to 
the free sugars in sugar-sweetened 
beverages. 
3, 
 
4 Since 2001, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) has recommended that no 
more than half of children’s daily 
fruit servings come from 100% fruit 
juice. The AAP recommends that 
children 1 to 6 years old limit fruit 
juice intake to 4 to 6 oz per day and 
that children ≥7 years limit intake to 
8 to 12 oz per day.3 The 2015–2020 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
(DGA) have endorsed these 
guidelines by the AAP. 
5
Younger children drink more 100% 
fruit juice than any other age group 
and often consume more than is 
recommended by the AAP and DGA. 
6 
Almost two-thirds of children drink 
100% fruit juice by age 1 year. 
7 
Almost half of young children 2 to 
8 years old are consumers. Among 
children who drink any 100% fruit 
juice, mean consumption is 10.6 oz 
per day among children 2 to 18 years 
of age and 9.9 oz per day among 
children 2 to 8 years of age. Almost 
one-third of children 2 to 6 years 
old consume >6 oz per day of 100% 
fruit juice. Only 2% of children 7 
to 18 years old exceed AAP/DGA 
recommendations (consuming >12 
oz per day). 
7
Whether 100% fruit juice may cause 
weight gain and obesity in children 
is an open question, with individual 
studies yielding mixed findings. 
2, 
 
8 
One systematic review 
9 and 1 meta-
analysis 
10 concluded that 100% fruit 
juice consumption was not associated 
with excess weight in children, but 
both had limitations. The systematic 
review by O’Neil and Nicklas11 had a 
low score (3/11) on the Assessing the 
Methodological Quality of Systematic 
Reviews (AMSTAR) quality rating 
scale. The meta-analysis by Crowe-
White and colleagues 
10 had an 
intermediate AMSTAR score (7/11) 
and was limited in that only PubMed 
was searched, 2 large studies 
from 2015 were not included, 
 
1, 
 
12 
and 15 of the 16 included studies 
were cross-sectional, which are 
liable to confounding and reverse 
causation. 
13 Crowe-White and 
colleagues10 acknowledged receiving 
funding from the Juice Products 
Association and PepsiCo, which 
raises concerns about influence on 
the part of these funders. An updated, 
methodologically rigorous synthesis 
of the data on the effects of 100% 
fruit juice on children’s weight is 
needed.
We therefore performed a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of 
longitudinal studies that investigated 
the association between 100% fruit 
juice consumption and change in BMI 
or BMI z score ( 
Table 1).
METHODS
Literature Search
This study complied with the 
Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses statement. 
14 The methods 
were prespecified and documented 
in a protocol (PROSPERO registration 
number: CRD42016032868). 
15
We conducted primary systematic 
literature searches using 
combinations of keywords, including 
juice, beverages, fruit, weight, 
and weight gain (see the Search 
Strategy section in the Supplemental 
Materials for the full list). We used 
broad keywords and MeSH terms 
to err on the side of inclusiveness. 
We searched 4 databases: PubMed 
(Medline), Embase, CINAHL, and 
the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We 
searched each database for peer-
reviewed articles available in English 
from its inception through December 
31, 2015.
Study Selection
Studies were included if they met the 
following criteria: (1) the exposure 
variable included 100% fruit juice; 
(2) outcomes included change in 
BMI or BMI z score; (3) the study 
design was a randomized controlled 
trial, other controlled experimental 
study, or cohort study; (4) the article 
was in English in a peer-reviewed 
journal; (5) the population was 
human subjects ages 1 to 18 years 
old; and (6) the follow-up time was 
at least 6 months. The type of dietary 
assessment instrument was not 
an inclusion criterion. Studies that 
measured baseline 100% fruit juice 
consumption or change in 100% fruit 
juice consumption were included.
Studies were excluded if they met any 
of the following criteria: (1) the juice 
exposure variable was not limited to 
100% fruit juice; (2) the study design 
was cross-sectional or narrative 
review; (3) the study population 
was hospitalized patients or 
malnourished subjects. We excluded 
cross-sectional studies because they 
are particularly prone to confounding 
and reverse causation. If >1 article 
was published on the same subjects, 
results from only 1 study were

included in the analysis so as not 
to include the same subjects more 
than once. When multiple articles 
analyzed the same subjects, we 
included only the article with the 
largest number of participants.
Two authors reviewed titles and 
abstracts and excluded obviously 
irrelevant manuscripts that did not 
study fruit, fruit juice, beverages, 
weight, or BMI. Two authors 
independently reviewed each 
potentially eligible study selected 
for full-text review. Disagreements 
were resolved by a consensus of 
all authors. The software program 
Covidence (Melbourne, Victoria, 
Australia)was used to track searches 
and included/excluded articles. 
16
Data Extraction
Two authors abstracted data from 
the eligible studies using a standard 
form that included field for eligibility 
criteria, design features, study 
population, the number of individuals 
in each group, and outcomes related 
to 100% fruit juice consumption. 
We abstracted multivariable-
adjusted regression coefficients 
and corresponding SDs, SEs, and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
the association between 100% fruit 
juice consumption and change in 
BMI or BMI z score. Because total 
energy may mediate the association 
between 100% fruit juice and 
weight change, 
 
17 when possible we 
extracted estimates with and without 
adjustment for total energy. If a 
study did not report the SD, SE, or 
95% CI, we imputed this value using 
methods referenced in the Cochrane 
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of 
Interventions. 
18
Data Synthesis
Our primary association of interest 
was the change in BMI or BMI z score 
per 1 serving per day increase of 
100% fruit juice consumed during 
the time period specified in each 
study. The current AAP 100% fruit 
juice guidelines 
3 define 1 serving size 
of 100% fruit juice as 6 oz, whereas 
the 2015–2020 DGA 
5 define 1 serving 
of 100% fruit juice as 8 oz. Therefore, 
we counted 1 serving of 100% fruit 
juice as consumption of 6 to 8 oz.
We performed analyses both with 
and without the application of 
scaling factors to reported regression 
coefficients to standardize 1 serving 
of 100% fruit juice to 6 to 8 oz. across 
studies. We followed a method similar 
to that described by Malik et al 
19 
to standardize beverage serving sizes 
and, for the study by Faith et al, 
 
20 to 
adjust the reported change in BMI 
z score over 1 month to a change in 
BMI z score over 1 year.
Statistical Analysis
For the meta-analysis, we used means 
and SDs for the continuous outcomes 
of change in BMI and BMI z score. If 
a study reported both outcomes, we 
used BMI z score data because 7 of 
the 8 included studies analyzed this 
outcome and because BMI z score 
is commonly used by pediatricians. 
Changes in BMI z score of 0.25 to 
0.50 U are considered clinically 
significant in children with respect to 
weight and cardiometabolic risk. 
21, 
 
22 
In high-risk populations, such as 
obese adolescents, changes in BMI 
z score as small as 0.09 U may be 
associated with small changes in 
cardiometabolic risk. 
23 One study 
24 
did not analyze change in BMI 
z score; for this study, we used 
the Box-Cox transformation (L), 
median (M), generalized coefficient 
of variation (S) (LMS) method to 
convert the change in BMI to BMI z 
score.25
Consistent with previous studies, 
if included studies reported results 
for boys or girls, we abstracted the 
data as reported. We examined the 
association between 100% fruit 
juice consumption and BMI z score 
in models that did and did not adjust 
for energy intake. We performed 
a prespecified analysis of age 
subgroups.
I2 tests of heterogeneity were 
performed to identify the presence 
of any between-study variation 
across pooled studies. 
26 We 
performed meta-analyses using 
both fixed-effects 
27 and random-
effects 
28 methods. Random-effects 
results are similar to fixed-effects 
results when heterogeneity is not 
substantial (I2 < 50%). We used 
fixed-effects models to generate 
main findings except when 
substantial heterogeneity was 
present (I2 > 50%). In this case, we 
report results from random-effects 
models. We calculated 95% CIs for 
individual study results (if they 
were not presented in the original 
articles) and for pooled estimates, 
with CIs not encompassing 0 
indicative of statistical significance 
(P < .05, two-tailed). Stata version 
14 (Stata Corp, College Station, 
TX) was used to conduct the 
meta-analysis. 
29
Risk of Bias Assessment
Two authors assessed the risk of 
bias and study quality using the 
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort 
studies. 
30 Disagreements in ratings 
were resolved by discussion between 
the 2 authors. The Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale addresses 3 broad 
domains: selection of exposed and 
unexposed subjects, comparability 
to other cohorts, and outcome 
assessment. One star was awarded 
for high-quality features in each 
area, with a maximum score of 9 
stars overall. Two stars are possible 
in the comparability to other 
cohorts domain of the Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale and must be chosen 
by investigators for each systematic 
review. We awarded 1 star for 
provision of regression coefficients 
that adjusted for total energy intake 
and 1 star for age adjustment. Studies 
with a score >7 were considered 
high quality, those with a score of 5 
to 6 were considered intermediate 
quality, and those with a score <5 
3

were considered poor quality. 
A detailed explanation of the 
domains of study quality is presented 
in Supplemental Table 5.
RESULTS
Literature Search
Our search strategy identified 4657 
unique citations, of which 36 were 
selected for full-text review after 
screening titles and abstracts ( 
Fig 1). 
After full-text review, 28 articles 
were excluded (Supplemental Table 6), 
leaving 8 for analysis. Of the 28 
excluded studies, 17 were excluded 
because the exposures did not 
include 100% fruit juice, 5 because 
they were systematic reviews, 3 
because the outcome was not change 
in BMI or BMI z score, 1 because we 
could not confirm that the fruit juice 
was 100% fruit juice, 
 
31 and 1 because 
it was presented as a conference 
abstract only, with incomplete 
outcome reporting of 100% fruit 
juice consumption. 
32 Two studies 
analyzed the same subjects from the 
Growing Up Today Study; the smaller 
of the 2 was excluded. 
33
Study Characteristics
All 8 included studies were 
prospective cohort studies ( 
Table 2). 
Six studies were conducted in the 
United States, 1 was conducted in 
Germany, and 1 was conducted in 
the United Kingdom. Baseline ages 
of study participants ranged from 1 
year to 12 years. Study size ranged 
from 244 to 14 918 subjects, and 
follow-up duration ranged from 6 
months to 10 years. Studies used 
either food records (n = 3) or food 
frequency questionnaires (n = 5) 
to assess diet. All included studies 
distinguished between 100% fruit 
juice and fruit drinks containing 
<100% fruit drinks. Five studies 
adjusted for total energy intake, 
and all studies adjusted for age or 
presented subgroup analyses by age. 
Six of the 8 studies assessed 100% 
fruit juice exposure at baseline only, 
as opposed to the analyses done by 
Dong et al 
34 and Libuda et al 
35 that 
assessed change in 100% fruit juice 
intake between 2 time points. The 
baseline mean BMI was reported or 
could be calculated in all 8 included 
studies and ranged from 16.2 ± 2.0 
kg/m2 to 18.6 ± 3.8 kg/m2. This range 
of baseline mean BMI falls within 
the normal weight range of age and 
sex-adjusted BMI. The baseline mean 
consumption of 100% fruit juice was 
reported in 7 studies, and ranged 
from 3.9 ± 0.2 oz per day to 18.0 ± 7.2 
oz per day ( 
Table 2).
Risk of Bias
Study quality and risk of bias are 
summarized in Supplemental Table 5. 
Quality scores ranged from 5 to 9 out 
of a possible score of 9. Five studies 
had a quality score of ≥7, which 
we considered high quality. Loss to 
follow-up was a significant problem 
across cohorts: only 2 studies had a 
<20% loss to follow-up. 
12, 
 
38
Nonuniform Reported Exposure and 
Outcome Measures
The 8 included studies reported 
different 100% fruit juice exposure 
amounts (range, 1 oz/day to 17 oz/
day) and different time periods 
of change in BMI z score (range, 1 
month to 6.7 years). The reported 
time period of change in BMI z score 
was often shorter than the overall 
follow-up time period of included 
studies. Because of the small number 
of included studies, age subgroup 
analysis was only possible for 2 
groups: younger children (baseline 
age 1–6 years) and older children 
(baseline age 7–18 years).
Meta-analysis: Younger Children 
(Baseline Age 1–6 Years)
Three of the 4 studies (combined 
n = 9583) of younger children 
found statistically significant 
associations between 100% fruit

Sonneville et al 
12 found an increase 
in the BMI z score of 0.17 (95% CI: 
0.00 to 0.33; no energy adjustment) 
for 1-year-olds who consumed 1 
to 2 servings per day of 100% fruit 
juice (8–15 oz/day) over 2 years. 
This increase in BMI z score was 
nonconstant across time, with the 
majority of the increase occurring 
when the subjects had mean ages of 1 
to 3 years ( 
Table 3). Sonneville et al 
12 
analyzed these same children over 
7 years (from mean ages 1–8 years) 
and found their BMI z score increased 
by 0.22 (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.39; no 
energy adjustment). Energy-adjusted 
analyses produced similar results.
Shefferly et al 
1 performed 2 separate 
analyses and found that age modified 
the change in BMI z score by an order 
of magnitude ( 
Table 3). In their first 
analysis of children with a baseline 
age of 2 years (n = 8950), Shefferly 
et al 
1 found an increase in BMI z score 
of 0.28 over 2 years (95% CI: 0.13 to 
0.44; no energy adjustment). In their 
second analysis, considering only the 
1-year period between ages 4 and 5 
(n = 6250), the BMI z score increased 
by only 0.02 (95% CI: 0.003 to 0.037; 
no energy adjustment).
Faith et al 
20 followed children with 
a mean baseline age of 2.5 years 
and reported the change in BMI z 
score per month observed over a 
study period of 6 to 48 months. After 
application of a scaling factor, per 
each 1 serving per day increase in 
100% fruit juice, Faith et al 
20 found 
an increase in BMI z score of 0.06 
over 1 year (95% CI: 0.019 to 0.101; 
no energy adjustment).
In children with a mean baseline age 
of 2.9 years, Newby et al 
24 found a 
BMI z score increase of 0.060 per 
each 6-oz serving per day increase in 
100% fruit juice over 6 to 12 months 
(95% CI: –0.003 to 0.152; serving size 
scaling factor applied; change in BMI 
converted to change in BMI z score via 
the LMS method; energy adjusted).
Three nonenergy-adjusted and 2 
energy-adjusted studies in younger 
children were each pooled ( 
Figs 2 and 
 
3). The pooled regression coefficients 
should be interpreted as the change 
in BMI z score per 6- to 8-oz serving 
per day increment of 100% fruit 
juice consumed over ∼1 year. In 
nonenergy-adjusted studies, there was 
significant heterogeneity (I2 = 67%, 
P = .049), and the pooled regression 
coefficient was 0.046 (95% CI: 0.000 
to 0.093; random-effects model). In 
the 2 energy-adjusted studies, the 
pooled regression coefficient was 
0.087 (95% CI: 0.008 to 0.167; fixed-
effects model), and there was not 
significant heterogeneity (I2 = 27%, 
P = .24). These increases in pooled 
BMI z scores translate into absolute 
increases of 2% (nonenergy-adjusted) 
to 4% (energy-adjusted) in the BMI 
percentile over 1 year.
The nonenergy-adjusted and energy-
adjusted subgroups pooled different 
studies, aside from the study by 
Sonneville et al, 
 
12 which was pooled 
in both groups. Sonneville et al 
12 had 
the largest effect size and carried 
more weight in the energy-adjusted 
group. The difference in BMI z score 
between the 2 groups is likely due to 
the fact that the study by Sonneville 
et al 
12 had a larger estimate than 
Shefferly et al, 
 
1 which dominated 
the pooled BMI z score change in the 
nonenergy-adjusted group.
Meta-analysis: Older Children 
(Baseline Ages 7–18 Years)
None of the 4 studies (combined 
n = 16498) of older children 
found statistically significant 
associations between 100% fruit 
juice consumption and change in 
BMI z score ( 
Figs 2 and  
3). The mean 
baseline 100% fruit juice intake 
ranged from 3.9 oz/d to 6.8 oz/d 
( 
Table 2).
Without adjustment for total energy 
intake, each 6- to 8-oz serving per 
day increase in 100% fruit juice 
consumption was associated with a 
change in BMI z score of 0.000 (95% 
CI: –0.001 to 0.001; fixed-effects 
model) over 1 year. After adjustment 
for total energy intake, the pooled 
change in BMI z score was 0.003 (95% 
CI: 0.001 to 0.004; fixed-effects model). 
Although adjusting for total energy 
intake made the results statistically 
significant, an increase in BMI z score 
of 0.003 translates into a trivial 0% 
increase in BMI percentile. There 
was no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) in the 
pooled estimates in older children 
regardless of energy adjustment.
Removing the study by Dong et al, 
 
34 
which reported the longest time 
period over which change in BMI z 
score was measured in older children 
(3 years), increased heterogeneity 
(I2 = 45%; P = .14), but did not change 
the energy-unadjusted pooled 
estimate. Similarly, pooling reported 
regression coefficients without any 
scaling for serving size (ie, analyzing 
regression coefficients exactly as 
reported in the original studies) 
increased heterogeneity, but did not 
change energy-adjusted or nonenergy-
adjusted pooled estimates.
Meta-analysis: All Ages
For children of all baseline ages, 
the pooled nonenergy-adjusted 
regression coefficient was 0.002 
(95% CI: –0.002 to 0.006; random-
effects model), and there was 
significant heterogeneity (I2 = 63%; 
P = .01). The pooled energy-adjusted 
regression coefficient was 0.003 
(95% CI: 0.001 to 0.004; fixed-effects 
model), and there was not significant 
heterogeneity (I2 = 11%; P = .34).
Publication Bias
Visual inspection of the funnel plot 
(Supplemental Fig 4) suggests a 
possible lack of published studies 
with smaller sample sizes that report 
a nonsignificant effect, because there 
are no studies with a small SE and a 
regression coefficient <0.
DISCUSSION
This meta-analysis of prospective 
cohort studies found a statistically 
significant association between 
7

AUERBACH et al 
consumption of 100% fruit juice and 
increased BMI z score in children 
≤6 years of age, although the effect 
size was not clinically meaningful. 
21 
– 
23 
No association was found among 
children ≥7 years of age. An increase 
in BMI z score over time indicates 
that a child’s weight has increased out 
of proportion to his or her increase 
in height. As an example, consider a 
5-year-old girl at the 50th percentile 
for weight (18.0 kg) and BMI 
(15.2 kg/m2). An increase of 0.046 
to 0.087 BMI z–score U over 1 year 
translates into an increase in this 
child’s BMI percentile to the 52nd 
to 54th percentile: a weight gain of 
0.08 kg to 0.15 kg over 1 year. A small 
amount of weight gain that is not 
clinically significant at the individual 
level may gain significance when 
considered at the population level. 
40 
However, to determine whether the 
association between 100% fruit juice 
consumption and weight gain in 
younger children is significant at the 
population level, additional analyses 
would need to quantify how changes 
in the existing levels of 100% fruit 
juice consumption would translate 
into changes in the prevalence of 
overweight/obesity.
Although the pooled estimate of 
weight gain in younger children 
(ages 2–6 years) was not clinically 
significant, individual studies showed 
clinically significant weight gain in 
children <2 years of age. Two of the 
4 studies of children ≤6 years old, 
by Shefferly et al 
1 and Sonneville 
et al, 
 
12 were rated to be high quality 
using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 
and found large, clinically significant 
increases in BMI z scores in children 
with a baseline age of 1 to 2 years 
( 
Table 2). Shefferly et al 
1 found their 
subjects had a smaller increase in 
BMI z scores between the ages of 4 
8

and 5 years, compared with those 
between the ages of 2 and 4 years. 
These findings suggest that age may 
modify the association of 100% fruit 
juice consumption and change in BMI 
z score in children. It is biologically 
plausible that children ≤2 years old 
would be most susceptible to weight 
gain from consuming 1 serving per 
day of 100% fruit juice. One 6- to 
8-oz serving of 100% fruit juice 
represents a larger proportion of 
total daily energy intake in children 
≤2 years of age compared with older 
children.
Associations between 100% fruit 
juice and weight gain may be 
stronger among younger versus older 
children due to differences in the 
type of 100% fruit juice consumed. 
Apple juice is the leading type of 
fruit juice consumed by younger 
children, whereas orange juice is 
the leading fruit juice consumed by 
older children. 
41 Studies in adults 
show that different types of fruit 
juice may have different effects on 
cardiometabolic health, which may 
be due to differing glycemic loads. 
42, 
 
43 
We are not aware of studies in 
children that compare the health 
effects of different 100% fruit juice 
types, but 100% orange juice has a 
lower glycemic load than 100% apple 
juice. 
44
Across the studies considered in this 
meta-analysis, adjustment for total 
energy intake minimally affected 
the change in BMI z score associated 
with 100% fruit juice consumption. 
If we assume that energy intake 
was measured precisely, these 
findings suggest a mechanism that 
is independent of calories. However, 
self-reported measures of total 
energy intake are imprecise, 
 
45 
precluding our ability to make 
inferences about the most likely 
mechanisms.
This study has limitations. All 
included studies were observational 
and varied with respect to exposure 
assessment, outcome assessment, and 
adjustment for covariates, introducing 
heterogeneity. Not all studies adjusted 
for the same covariates, which could 
impact the magnitude of estimated

associations between fruit juice 
intake and BMI. Measurement error 
in the exposure assessment may have 
biased the associations we found. Six 
of the 8 studies assessed 100% fruit 
juice exposure at baseline only, as 
opposed to the change analysis done 
by Dong et al 
34 and Libuda et al 
35 that 
assessed change in 100% fruit juice 
intake between 2 time points. Analysis 
of individual dietary components at 
baseline only, as opposed to change 
analysis, may cause attenuated 
associations or reverse causation. 
46 
Only 1 study, by Dong et al, 
 
34 included 
participants with baseline ages 
between 6 years and 9 years, which 
limits inferences about the association 
of 100% fruit juice on BMI z score 
in middle childhood. Only 2 studies 
(energy adjusted)12, 
 
24 or 3 studies 
(not energy adjusted) 
1, 
 
12, 
 
20 could 
be pooled for meta-analyses in the 
younger age group. Finally, 100% fruit 
juice consumption was not compared 
with consumption of fruit or another 
energy source, and this study does 
not examine the substitution effects of 
consuming 100% fruit juice in place of 
whole fruit.
The strengths of this study include 
an extensive literature search 
completed by 2 authors at all stages 
and the inclusion of only longitudinal 
studies, which represent the highest 
quality studies published on this 
topic. We performed analyses both 
with and without adjustment for 
total energy intake. We applied more 
conservative data transformations 
to the scaling of reported regression 
coefficients then in previous meta-
analyses of sugary beverages and 
weight gain in children. 
19 This 
systematic review and meta-analysis 
has a high AMSTAR score (10/11), 
and there was no beverage industry 
participation.
CONCLUSIONS
This systematic review and meta-
analysis of 8 prospective cohort 
studies (n = 34 470 individual 
children) provides evidence that 
consumption of 1 daily serving 
increment of 100% fruit juice is 
associated with a small amount of 
weight gain in children ≤6 years 
old, but not in older children. 
The small amount of weight gain 
observed in children <6 years old 
is not clinically significant at the 
individual level and is of uncertain 
significance at the population 
level. Children ages 1 to 2 years 
may be more susceptible to weight 
gain from drinking 1 daily serving 
increment of 100% fruit juice. 
Randomized controlled trials 
examining the effect of 100% fruit 
juice consumption on metabolic 
and health outcomes, including 
weight gain and overweight/
obesity, are needed in children 
ages 1 to 6 years. Future studies 
should standardize 100% fruit 
juice exposures (serving size), 
outcomes (eg, change in BMI or BMI 
z score over 1 year) and perform 
subgroup analyses by 100% fruit 
juice type. Until additional studies 
are performed, the AAP’s current 
recommendation that children 
ages 1 to 6 years limit 100% fruit 
juice consumption to 4 to 6 oz 
per day and children ages 7 to 18 
limit 100% fruit juice to 8 to 12 oz 
per day is prudent and should be 
followed.
