Association analyses of more than 140,000 men 
identify 63 new prostate cancer susceptibility loci
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and fine-mapping 
efforts to date have identified more than 100 prostate can-
cer (PrCa)-susceptibility loci. We meta-analyzed genotype 
data from a custom high-density array of 46,939 PrCa cases 
and 27,910 controls of European ancestry with previously 
genotyped data of 32,255 PrCa cases and 33,202 controls of 
 
European ancestry. Our analysis identified 62 novel loci asso-
ciated (P < 
 5.0 × 
 10−8) with PrCa and one locus significantly 
associated with early-onset PrCa (≤ 
55 years). Our findings 
include missense variants rs1800057 (odds ratio (OR) = 
 1.16; 
P = 
 8.2 × 
 10−9; G> 
C, p.Pro1054Arg) in ATM and rs2066827 
(OR = 
 1.06; P = 
 2.3 × 
 10−9; T> 
G, p.Val109Gly) in CDKN1B. The 
combination of all loci captured 28.4% of the PrCa familial 
relative risk, and a polygenic risk score conferred an elevated 
PrCa risk for men in the ninetieth to ninety-ninth percentiles 
(relative risk = 
 2.69; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.55–2.82) 
and first percentile (relative risk = 
 5.71; 95% CI: 5.04–6.48) 
 
risk stratum compared with the population average. These 
findings improve risk prediction, enhance fine-mapping, and 
provide insight into the underlying biology of PrCa1.
Although PrCa is the most common noncutaneous cancer among 
men in the Western world, and one in seven men will be diagnosed 
during their lifetime2, very few modifiable risk factors have been 
established3. Epidemiological studies have identified age, positive 
family history, and ancestry as the most prominent risk factors for 
PrCa4–7. PrCa incidence is highest among men of African ancestry, 
followed by men of European and Asian ancestries. These observa-
tions of ancestral differences in PrCa risk, in conjunction with stud-
ies demonstrating the influence of family history8,9, highlight the 
contribution of genetics to PrCa etiology10. Our previous work, using 
a multiplicative model, has estimated that more than 1,800 common 
SNPs independently contribute to PrCa risk among populations of 
European ancestry11. GWAS have reported more than 100 of these 
PrCa variants across multiancestral populations, most of which were 
identified in populations of European ancestry12–29.
To facilitate additional discovery of PrCa genetic risk factors, we 
developed a custom high-density genotyping array, the OncoArray, 
including a 260,000-SNP backbone designed to adequately tag most 
common genetic variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) > 
5% in 
Europeans), and 310,000 SNPs from meta-analyses of five cancers 
(breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and prostate)30. Approximately 
80,000 PrCa-specific markers derived from our previous multian-
cestral meta-analysis12 (including populations of European, African 
American, Japanese, and Latino ancestry), fine-mapping of known 
PrCa loci, and candidate SNPs nominated by study collaborators were 
included on the OncoArray. We assembled a new PrCa sample series 
from 52 studies to genotype with the OncoArray (Supplementary 
Tables 1 and 2). After application of rigorous quality control (QC) 
criteria and removal of overlapping samples from previous studies, 
our OncoArray sample yielded 46,939 PrCa cases and 27,910 con-
trols without a known diagnosis of PrCa and of European ancestry 
for analysis (Methods and Supplementary Table 3). Genotypes were 
phased and imputed to the cosmopolitan panel of the 1000 Genomes 
Project (1KGP; June 2014 release) in SHAPEIT31 and IMPUTEv2 
(ref.32) software (Methods and Supplementary Table 3). We per-
formed a fixed-effects meta-analysis combining the summary statis-
tics from our OncoArray analysis and seven previous PrCa GWAS 
 
or high-density SNP panels of European ancestry imputed to the 
1KGP
. The final meta-analysis included 79,194 PrCa cases and 61,112 
 
controls without a known diagnosis of PrCa (Fig. 1).
We performed study- and consortia-specific meta-analyses to 
identify novel PrCa risk loci. We established a P-value threshold 
of 5.0 × 10−8 to determine genome-wide significance. Our large 
sample size enabled several stratified meta-analyses focusing on key 
clinical and biological parameters (Methods and Supplementary 
Tables 4 and 5). All analyses used a likelihood-ratio test to mini-
mize bias from rare variants, and a logistic-regression framework 
was used for all analyses, except for the Gleason score, for which 
linear regression was used. The genotype doses were incorporated 
in an allelic genetic model. The average λ1000, an inflation statistic 
calibrated to a sample size of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls33, across 
the eight GWAS studies was 1.02 (range 0.98–1.09) and 1.00 for the 
overall meta-analysis (Supplementary Table 6). Our novel findings 
excluded variants within defined fine-mapped regions of previously 
reported PrCa risk loci (Supplementary Table 7).
After the exclusion of all known susceptibility regions (fine-
mapping coordinates provided in Supplementary Table 7 and 
Supplementary Note), we identified 64 loci associated with over-
all PrCa susceptibility and 1 locus associated with early-onset 
PrCa (P < 5.0 × 10−8) in the meta-analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1), 
 
of which 53 were imputed, and 12 were genotyped with the 
OncoArray. The cluster plots for the genotyped makers are pre-
sented in Supplementary Fig. 2. Although most of the imputed 
markers were of high quality, with an average imputed r2 > 
0.80 
for 61 of the 65 loci across all contributing GWAS (Supplementary 
Table 8), we closely examined four variants with a poor imputation 
quality score (r2 < 
0.80) in the OncoArray samples by inspecting 
linkage disequilibrium (LD) plots including only genotyped SNPs 
from the OncoArray and performing an imputation QC assessment 
(Methods). After reviewing the LD plots and the imputation QC, 
we determined that loci rs6602880 and rs144166867 were probably 
false positives due to imputation artifacts (Supplementary Fig. 3  
and Supplementary Table 9). Overall, we identified 62 novel loci 
associated with overall PrCa risk and one novel locus associated 
with early-onset PrCa (Table 1). The consortia-specific associa-
tions were consistent across the eight contributing GWAS studies 
(Supplementary Table 10).
We performed several stratified analyses defined by clinical and 
population parameters. We detected a novel variant, rs138004030, 
which was significantly associated with early-onset disease (Table 1) 
but was only nominally significant for overall PrCa risk (P = 0.02). 
In addition, we detected four markers significantly associated 
(P < 5 × 10−8) with advanced PrCa and two markers associated with 
early-onset PrCa (Supplementary Table 11). However, the case-only

analyses of these markers indicated marginal statistical signifi-
cance (P < 1.0 × 10−3). Additionally, these markers were in LD with 
nearby index markers associated with overall PrCa and were not 
significantly associated with overall aggressive disease after adjust-
ment for the index marker (Supplementary Table 11). A similar 
association pattern was observed for rs111599055, which was in 
LD with rs7295014 (r2 = 0.54), a marker associated with overall dis-
ease. The early-onset marker rs77777548 was independent of novel 
and known PrCa-risk loci. However, the marker was relatively rare 
(effect-allele frequency < 
0.02), was indicated as monomorphic in 
the 1KGP, and had a moderate imputation quality score (average 
r2 = 0.57); hence, we did not include it in further analyses.
Among the 63 novel associations, 38 variants were found to be 
located within gene-rich regions (Supplementary Table 12): intronic 
(32 SNPs), missense (4 SNPs), and 3′ 
 untranslated region (UTR) 
 
(2 SNPs). Analyses of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database identified statisti-
cally significant associations (P < 0.05; Supplementary Table 12) in

associations were consistent with the observed PrCa–SNP asso-
ciations, given that we assessed colocalization between the GWAS 
and eQTL SNPs. The TCGA data analysis did not identify an eQTL 
association with any of the four missense SNPs.
We assessed the association of our newly discovered loci 
 
with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels by using a series of 
disease-free controls (n = 9,090; Methods). Among the 48 avail-
able loci, we observed a significant association for rs8093601 
(P = 5.0 × 10−4; Supplementary Table 13) after correction for mul-
tiple testing (P = 0.05/48 = 1.0 × 10−3). This marker lies near MBD2 
(encoding methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2) and has not 
previously been associated with either PrCa risk or PSA levels. 
 
The effect estimates of PrCa clinical features and overall PrCa did 
not differ (Supplementary Table 14). LD plots incorporating several 
functional annotation features for each of the 63 novel markers are 
presented in Supplementary Fig. 4.
Several strong candidate genes were identified among the 
PrCa-susceptibility loci, including ATM, a key gene within the 
DNA-damage response pathway, in which truncating variants 
contribute to PrCa susceptibility and progression, particularly 
aggressive PrCa34,35. The index variant within this region is the 
missense variant rs1800057, exerting a modestly increased risk 
of PrCa (OR = 1.16; P = 8.15 × 10−9; G> 
C, p.Pro1054Arg; Fig. 2a). 
Although rs1800057 is designated ‘benign’ by ClinVar (see URLs), 
it has been suggested to be associated with a twofold-increased risk 
of early-onset PrCa in a small clinical series and has been found 
to be unassociated with morbidity after treatment36. In addition to 
the ATM region, we identified missense variants at three separate 
loci: rs2066827 within CDKN1B, encoding a cyclin-dependent-
kinase inhibitor that controls cell-cycle progression; rs33984059 
within RFX7, encoding a transcription factor; and rs2277283 within 
INCENP, encoding a centromere-interacting protein.
rs1048169 at 9p22 is located in the 3′ 
 UTR of HAUS6 (Fig. 2b), 
which encodes a subunit of augmin, a protein complex required for 
proper microtubule formation and chromosome segregation dur-
ing cell division37. rs1048169 is also an eQTL for HAUS6 expres-
sion. Interestingly, an additional lead SNP identified in this study, 
rs11666569 at 19p13, was found to be an eQTL for two genes, 
including HAUS8, which encodes another member of the augmin 
complex. These discoveries may implicate a potential role of aug-
min in PrCa susceptibility.
rs7968403 (OR = 1.06; P = 3.38 × 10−12; Fig. 2c) is situated within 
the first intron of RASSF3. Members of the Ras-association-domain 
family (RASSF) are putative tumor suppressors implicated in a 
 
range of biological processes38. RASSF3 is ubiquitously expressed 
across tissue types and has been observed to arrest the cell cycle 
 
in the G1 phase and to induce apoptosis through the p53 path-
way39. A PrCa-risk locus, ~100 kb away, within RASSF6 has been 
identified in a previous study11. However, rs7968403 was also an 
eQTL for the distant WIF1 (encoding WNT-inhibitory factor 1; 
Fig. 2c). WIF1 inhibits Wnt signaling and is frequently downregu-
lated in PrCa40, whereas aberrant activation of Wnt signaling is com-
mon in many solid tumor types. Restoration of WIF1 expression has 
also been demonstrated to decrease cell motility and invasiveness in 
a metastatic PrCa cell line and to reduce tumor growth in a mouse 
xenograft model41. Both RASSF3 and WIF1 therefore are plausible 
mechanisms for the modulation of PrCa risk at this locus.
rs28441558 at 17p13 was the lead variant for a cluster of highly 
correlated SNPs centered on the CHD3 gene (Fig. 2d). CHD3 encodes 
an ATPase that forms a component of the nucleosome-remodeling 
and deacetylase (NuRD) histone deacetylase complex, which is 
involved in chromatin remodeling. NuRD plays an important role 
in regulating gene expression, as both a silencer and an activator 
of transcription, in addition to its roles in maintaining genomic 
integrity and in the DNA-damage response42. Alterations in NuRD 
function have been implicated in several cancer types and found 
to act in a highly complex manner43,44. However, rs28441558 was 
also observed to be an eQTL for three genes: LOC284023, encoding 
a currently uncharacterized noncoding RNA transcript; GUCY2D, 
encoding a guanylate cyclase enzyme expressed predominantly in 
the retina; and ALOX15B, encoding a member of the lipoxygenase 
family of enzymes that produce fatty acid hyperoxides. Although 
CHD3 appears to be the most biologically plausible candidate gene 
for this locus, we cannot exclude roles of any of these genes.
Our pathway analysis based on mapping each SNP to the near-
est gene (Methods) by using the meta-analysis summary association 
statistic identified several pathways implicated in PrCa susceptibil-
ity. The top 53 pathways detected (enrichment score (ES) > 
0.50) are 
provided in Supplementary Table 15. The most significant pathway 
detected was PD-1 signaling (ID: 389948), ES = 0.74, as defined by 
the REACTOME database (Supplementary Fig. 5). This pathway 
is intriguing, given the therapeutic potential of several checkpoint 
inhibitors focusing on the PD-1 signaling pathway to enhance 
immune responses45.
In summary, we identified 63 novel PrCa-susceptibility variants, 
including strong candidate loci highlighting the DNA-repair and 
cell-cycle pathways. Previous studies have probably overestimated 
the effect estimates of PrCa loci as a result of the ‘winner’s curse’
, 
thus yielding a biased familial relative risk (FRR) and polygenic 
risk score (PRS). Here, we applied a weighted Bayesian correction 
approach and demonstrated that our large sample size minimized 
the winner’s curse bias46 (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 6). We 
applied the beta estimates calculated in our overall meta-analysis to 
the OncoArray sample set to calculate the FRR and PRS risk models 
(Supplementary Table 16). Our prediction models included 85 pre-
viously reported PrCa loci replicating in our overall meta-analysis 
and our 62 novel loci associated with overall PrCa risk. Assuming 
a familial risk estimate of 2.5 for PrCa47,48, we demonstrated that 
our 147 loci captured 28.4% of the FRR (Supplementary Table 17). 
The 62 newly identified PrCa loci increased the FRR by 4.4%. On 
the basis of the assumption of a log-additive model, the estimated 
RR for PrCa relative to men in the twenty-fifth to seventy-fifth 
 
PRS percentiles (baseline group) was 5.71 (95% CI: 5.04–6.48) for 
men in the top first percentile of the PRS distribution and 2.69 
(95% CI: 2.55–2.82) for individuals in the ninetieth to ninety-ninth 
percentiles of the PRS distribution (Table 2). The PRS score was 
positively associated with overall PrCa risk (OR = 1.86; 95% CI: 
1.83–1.89; Supplementary Table 18). Our novel associations high-
light several biological pathways that warrant further investigation. 
The increased PRS can be used to improve the identification of 
men at high risk for PrCa and therefore inform PSA guidelines for 
screening and management to reduce the burden of over-testing.

Methods
Study subjects. A brief overview and study details for participating PrCa studies 
in the newly genotyped OncoArray project are provided in Supplementary Table 1 
for men of European ancestry. All studies were approved by the appropriate ethics 
committees (as described in the references for each study listed in Supplementary 
Table 1), and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Supplementary 
Table 2 summarizes the PrCa sample series of the Elucidating Loci Involved in 
Prostate Cancer Susceptibility (ELLIPSE) consortium contributing both newly 
obtained genotyping data for the OncoArray and previous GWAS. Most of the 
studies contributing to the OncoArray were case–control studies primarily based 
in either the United States or Europe. In total, 52 new studies provided core data on 
disease status, age at diagnosis (age at observation or questionnaire for controls), 
family history of PrCa, and clinical factors for cases (for example, PSA at diagnosis 
and Gleason score) for 48,455 PrCa cases and 28,321 disease-free controls. 
Previous GWAS contributed an additional 32,255 PrCa cases and 33,202 disease-
free controls of European ancestry to the overall meta-analysis12. Supplementary 
Table 3 provides QC information by consortia (e.g., OncoArray project, UK 
GWAS, and so forth) for both samples and SNPs. After removal of all overlapping 
samples, the OncoArray contribution for newly genotyped samples was 46,939 
PrCa cases and 27,910 disease-free controls.
Several strata-specific analyses were implemented to evaluate the effects of 
genetic variation on PrCa disease aggressiveness. Supplementary Table 4 describes 
the analysis title, outcome and reference groups, and the statistical model used. 
Several classification schemes (low aggressiveness, intermediate aggressiveness, and 
so forth) were implemented to better assess the spectrum of genetic involvement. 
All classification schemes incorporated the diagnostic clinical features PSA, tumor 
stage, and Gleason score. To compare the results with those from previous PrCa 
aggressive analyses12 by our research group, we included the ‘advanced (plus death 
due to PrCa)’ classification. Contributing study groups missing clinical features 
were excluded (Supplementary Table 2). Individuals with missing or granular 
clinical information were excluded. The strata-specific sample sizes from the 
PrCa GWAS consortium are provided in Supplementary Table 5. Furthermore, we 
analyzed Gleason score as a continuous variable.
OncoArray SNP selection. The NCI GAME-ON consortium (http://epi.grants.
cancer.gov/gameon/) provided SNPs to be included in the Illumina OncoArray. 
Approximately 50% of the OncoArray was a compilation of SNP lists by the GAME-
ON disease consortium of cancer (breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and prostate), a 
common set of variants for common risk regions, other related traits (BMI, age at 
menarche, and so forth), pharmacogenetics, and candidates30. The remaining content 
of the OncoArray was selected as a ‘GWAS backbone’ (Illumina HumanCore), which 
aimed to provide high coverage for most common variants through imputation. 
Approximately 79,000 SNPs were selected specifically for their relevance to PrCa, 
on the basis of prior evidence of association with overall or subtype-specific disease, 
fine-mapping of known PrCa regions, and candidate submissions (survival, exome 
sequencing, and so forth). To maximize the efficiency of the array, cancer-specific 
candidate lists were merged to remove redundant genetic variation30.
Genotype calling and quality control. Details of the genotype calling and QC for 
the iCOGS and GWAS have been described elsewhere11–28.
Of the 568,712 variants selected for genotyping on the OncoArray, 533,631 were 
successfully manufactured on the array (including 778 duplicate probes). OncoArray 
genotyping of ELLIPSE studies was conducted at five sites (Cambridge, CIDR, 
Copenhagen, USC, and NCI). Details of the genotype calling for the OncoArray 
have been described in more detail elsewhere30. Briefly, we developed a single calling 
pipeline that was applied to more than 500,000 samples across the GAME-ON 
consortium. An initial cluster file was generated by using 56,284 samples selected 
from all major genotyping centers and ancestries, with the Gentrain2 algorithm. 
Variants likely to have problematic clusters were selected for manual inspection 
on the basis of the following criteria: call rate < 
99%, MAF < 
0.001, poor Illumina 
intensity and clustering metrics, deviation from the MAF observed in the 1KGP, by 
using the criterion

, where p0 and p1 are the minor frequencies 
in the 1KGP and OncoArray datasets, respectively, and C = 0.008. This procedure 
resulted in manual adjustment of the cluster file for 3,964 variants and the exclusion 
of 16,526 variants. The final cluster file was then applied to the full dataset.
Our QC pipeline for ELLIPSE excluded SNPs with a call rate < 
95% by study, not 
 
in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P < 10−7 in controls or P < 10−12 in cases) or with  
concordance < 
98% among 11,260 duplicate pairs. To minimize imputation errors, we 
 
additionally excluded SNPs with a MAF < 
1% and a call rate < 
98% in any study, SNPs 
 
that could not be linked to the 1KGP reference, those with MAF for Europeans that 
 
differed from that for the 1KGP, and a further 16,526 SNPs for which the cluster plot  
was judged to be not ideal. Of the 533,631 manufactured SNPs on the OncoArray, we 
 
retained 498,417 SNPs among our samples of European ancestry after QC.
We excluded duplicate samples and first-degree relatives within each study, 
duplicates across studies, samples with a call rate < 
95%, and samples with 
extreme heterozygosity (> 
4.9 s.d. from the mean for the reported ancestry). We 
excluded duplicated samples as well as first-degree relatives across the GWAS 
studies CAPS1, CAPS2, UK Stage 1, UK Stage 2, and iCOGS. Duplicate and 
first-degree-related samples were assessed across the BPC3 and Pegasus GWAS 
studies as well. Ancestry was computed through principal component analysis 
using 2,318 informative markers on a subset of ~47,000 samples and projected 
onto the complete OncoArray dataset. The current analysis was restricted to men 
of European ancestry, defined as individuals with an estimated proportion of 
European ancestry > 
0.8, with reference to the HapMap populations, on the basis 
of the first two principal components. Of the 78,182 samples genotyped (regardless 
of ancestry), the final dataset consisted of 74,849 samples, of which 46,939 PrCa 
cases and 27,910 disease-free controls (Supplementary Table 3), after exclusion of 
overlap samples, were meta-analyzed with previous studies.
Imputation. We imputed genotypes for ~70 million SNPs for all samples by using 
the October 2014 (Phase 3) release of the 1KGP data as the reference panel. We 
imputed the OncoArray and GWAS datasets through a two-stage imputation 
approach, using SHAPEIT31 for phasing and IMPUTEv2 (ref. 32) for imputation. 
The imputation was performed in 5-Mb nonoverlapping intervals. All subjects 
were split into subsets of ~10,000 samples, with subjects from the same group in 
the subset. We imputed genotypes for all SNPs that were polymorphic (MAF > 
0.1%) in European samples. We excluded data for all monomorphic SNPs and 
those with an imputation r2 < 
0.3, thus leaving a total of 20,370,935 SNPs across 
chromosomes 1–22 and chromosome X. Of the SNPs imputed, 49.3% had a MAF 
< 
1%, 15.2% had a MAF ranging between 1% and 5%, and 35.5% had a MAF ≥ 
5%.
Statistical analyses. Per-allele odds ratios and standard errors were generated for the 
OncoArray and each GWAS, with adjustment for principal components and study-
relevant covariates through logistic regression. The OncoArray and iCOGS analyses 
were additionally stratified by country and study, respectively. We used the first seven 
principal components in our analysis of individuals of European ancestry, because 
additional components did not further decrease inflation in the test statistics.
OR estimates were derived with either SNPTEST (https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/
genetics_software/snptest/snptest.html) or an in-house C+ 
+ program (Supplementary 
Table 3). OR estimates and standard errors were combined by a fixed-effects inverse 
variance meta-analysis in METAL50. All statistical tests conducted were two sided.
Our analyses included overall PrCa and several clinically relevant strata. 
These strata comprised: (i) high versus low aggressive PrCa; (ii) high versus low/
intermediate aggressive PrCa; (iii) advanced versus nonadvanced PrCa; (iv) 
advanced PrCa versus controls; (v) early-onset PrCa (≤ 
55 years) versus controls; 
and (iv) Gleason score (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). We defined low aggressive 
as tumor stage ≤ 
T1 and Gleason score ≤ 
6 and PSA < 
10 ng/mL; intermediate 
aggressive as tumor stage T2 or Gleason score = 7 or PSA 10–20 ng/mL; high 
aggressive as tumor stage T3/T4 or N1 or M1, or Gleason score ≥ 
8 or PSA > 
20 
ng/mL; and advanced as either metastatic disease, Gleason score ≥ 
8, PSA > 
100 or 
PrCa-related death (Supplementary Table 4).
Definition of newly associated loci. To search for novel loci, we assessed all SNPs 
excluding those within a known PrCa locus, defined by current fine-mapping 
assessments (Supplementary Table 7). SNPs that were associated with disease 
risk at P < 5 × 10−8 in the meta-analysis (GWAS and OncoArray) were considered 
novel. The SNP with the lowest P value in a region was considered the lead SNP. 
Imputation quality was assessed on the basis of IMPUTE2 imputation r2 in the 
OncoArray dataset (Supplementary Table 8).
For ten regions where the newly identified locus was near a previously known 
region, we reported a novel association if the pairwise r2 between the new and the 
previously known SNP was < 
0.2. For novel PrCa associations for which the variant 
was imputed in the OncoArray study sample series and had an imputed quality 
score < 
0.70, we assessed the quality of the imputation by masking the variant 
in a subset of the 1KGP European sample and calculating the concordance after 
reimputation in the remaining 1KGP samples.
Reliability of imputation. Novel SNPs with an IMPUTE2 r2 < 
0.80 among the 
OncoArray sample series (Supplementary Table 8) were flagged for further 
investigation to minimize the probability of false positives. First, we examined  
LD plots (http://locuszoom.org/) for poorly imputed SNPs (± 
500 kb), including 
only genotyped SNPs within the region. The imputed index SNP was included  
in the plot to determine the strength of LD with nearby signals and to assess a 
pattern of association. Furthermore, we performed an imputation experiment 
using the 2,504 1KGP Phase 3 samples. We split this sample into two parts: a 
random sample of 259 individuals of European ancestry (excluding Finnish 
individuals) and a mixed-population reference panel of 2,245 individuals. The 
random sample of 259 individuals of European ancestry was filtered to include 
only the genetic variants available from the OncoArray after QC. This procedure 
ensured that the same imputation input was used in the overall imputation.  
The 259 individuals were imputed by using 2,245 individuals as the reference 
panel. A 5-Mb segment of the genome was selected on the basis of the target  
SNP (± 
250 Mb). SHAPEIT2 was used for prephasing, and IMPUTE2 was  
used for imputation. Customized imputation settings included an effect size of 
20,000, allowance of large-region imputation and a random seed of 12345. A 
weighted linear kappa statistic was calculated to determine the correlation of the 
imputation with the true genotypes.

We evaluated four SNPs whose IMPUTE2 r2 was < 
0.80 in the OncoArray 
sample series: rs527510716 (chr 7), rs6602880 (chr 10), rs533722308 (chr 18), and 
rs144166867 (chr X). Supplementary Fig. 3 includes the LD plots for three of the 
poorly imputed SNPs. The variant rs144166867 (chr X) could not be plotted, because 
no genotype SNPs were available within ± 
500 kb on the OncoArray. Both LD plots 
for markers rs527510716 (chr 7) and rs533722308 (chr 18) showed significant 
associations (P < 1 × 10−3) for several genotype markers with moderate LD of the 
index SNP
. The kappa coefficients for markers rs527510716 (chr 7) and rs533722308 
(chr 18) were 0.911 and 0.931, respectively (Supplementary Table 9). The marker 
rs6602880 (chr 10) had a kappa coefficient of 0.812 and was the only significant 
variant in the LD plot. The kappa coefficient for marker rs144166867 (chr X) was 
0.665 (Supplementary Table 9). The markers rs6602880 (chr 10) and rs144166867 
(chr X) were probably false positives due to poor imputation for these regions.
Proportion of familial risk explained. The contribution of the known SNPs to the 
familial risk of PrCa, under a multiplicative model, was computed with the formula

On the basis of the assumption of a log-additive model, we constructed a PRS 
from the summed risk-allelic doses weighted by the per-allele log ORs. Thus, for 
each individual j, we derived:
∑ β

where N is the number of SNPs, gij is the allele dose at SNPi for individual j, and βi is 
the per-allele log-odds ratio of SNPi.
The risk of PrCa was estimated for the percentiles of the distribution of the PRS 
(< 
1, 1–10, 10–25, 25–75, 75–90, 90–99, > 
99 and < 
10, 10–25, 25–75, 75–90, > 
90) 
for which cumulative score thresholds were determined according to the observed 
distribution among controls. We applied effect sizes and allele frequencies obtained 
from the overall meta-analysis of Europeans to estimate risk scores for individuals of 
European ancestry in the OncoArray study51. A standardized PRS score was calculated 
by dividing the observed PRS score by the s.d. of the PRS score among controls.  
A logistic-regression framework was used to evaluate the percentile comparisons and 
to determine the risk estimate. The models were adjusted for the first seven principal 
components to account for population stratification and stratified by country.
The FRR and PRS risk estimation was limited to the variants for which our 
overall meta-analysis indicated a statistically significant association. In total, we 
included 147 PrCa index SNPs in our risk-score modeling, including 85 previously 
published associations and the 62 novel findings reported here. To correct for 
potential bias in effect estimation of newly discovered variants, we implemented 
a fully Bayesian version of a weighted correction given in equation (3).4 in ref. 46. 
Specifically, we placed a normal prior distribution on MLE effect estimates of the 
form β

eQTL analyses. Genotype and gene expression data were downloaded from TCGA 
for 494 samples with PrCa (https://gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov/). QC was performed on 
both these datasets as follows: on the genotype, we filtered out samples with high 
heterozygosity (mean heterozygosity ± 
2 s.d.) and missing genotypes and duplicated or 
related samples. We then performed principal component analysis on the 494 samples 
plus 2,506 samples from 1KGP to infer the ancestry of the TCGA samples; samples  
of non-European ancestry were removed. We also filtered out variants with missing  
call rate > 
5%. For the expression data, samples from two plates had, on average,  
much higher expression values than did the remaining samples and therefore were 
excluded. We also filtered genes with mean expression across samples ≤ 
6 counts. 
Finally, expression values were quantile-normalized by samples and rank-transformed 
by genes. After QC, we used the data from 359 samples. For the eQTL analysis, 35 
PEER factors from the top 10,000 expressed genes were used as covariates, plus three 
genotyping PCs (which explained 18% of total variation). eQTL analysis was performed 
in FastQTL with 1,000 permutations over the 85 regions. We used a window of 1 Mb 
(upstream/downstream) from the transcription start site of each gene.
Gene set enrichment analyses. The file Human_GOBP_AllPathways_no_GO_
iea_September_01_2016_symbol.gmt (http://baderlab.org/GeneSets/) from the 
GeneSets database52, was used for all analyses. This database contains pathways 
from Reactome53, NCI Pathway Interaction Database54, Gene Ontology (GO) 
biological process55, HumanCyc56, MSigdb57, NetPath58, and Panther59. We manually 
corrected several pathways in which the c gene was entered as PDK1. GO pathways 
inferred from electronic annotation terms were excluded. The same pathway (for 
example, apoptosis) may be defined in two or more databases with potentially 
different sets of genes, and all versions of these duplicate/overlapping pathways 
were included. Pathway size was determined by the total number of genes in 
the pathway to which SNPs in the imputed GWAS dataset could be mapped. To 
provide more biologically meaningful results, and to reduce false positives, only 
pathways that contained between 10 and 200 genes were considered.
Gene information (hg19) was downloaded from the ANNOVAR60 website 
(http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/). SNPs were mapped to the nearest 
gene within 500-kb windows; those that were further away from any gene were 
excluded. Gene significance was calculated by assigning the lowest P value 
observed across all SNPs assigned to a gene61,62, on the basis of the combined 
European meta-analysis (previous GWAS and OncoArray).
The gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA)52 algorithm, as implemented in the 
GenGen package (http://gengen.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/)62,63, was used to 
perform pathway analysis. Briefly, the algorithm calculates an ES for each pathway 
on the basis of a weighted Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic63. To calculate the ES, 
we performed 100 permutations and averaged the final score. Pathways with most 
of their genes at the top of the ranked list of genes obtain higher ES values. Only 
pathways with positive ES and at least one gene with P < 
5 × 10−8 were retained for 
subsequent analysis. An enrichment map was created in the Enrichment Map (EM) 
v 2.1.0 application52 in Cytoscape v3.40 (ref. 64), with application of force-directed 
layout, in weighted mode. We restricted our pathway analysis to those with an ES ≥ 
0.50 to ensure a true-positive rate > 
0.20 and a false-positive rate < 
0.15.

including our data availability policy, see Authors & Referees and the Editorial Policy Checklist. 
�    Experimental design
1.   Sample size
Describe how sample size was determined.
We recruited all available population studies with adequate DNA samples 
and eligible to deposit data into a public database. Our new sample series 
genotyped with OncoArray includes over 73,000 samples.
2.   Data exclusions
Describe any data exclusions.
We excluded all samples that performed poorly with respect to 
genotyping. We also limited our analyses to individuals of European 
ancestry to avoid the potential for spurious associations. 
3.   Replication
Describe whether the experimental findings were reliably reproduced. We meta-analyzed our new genotyped samples with previous studies. We 
set a stringent statistical threshold to minimize false positive results.
4.   Randomization
Describe how samples/organisms/participants were allocated into 
experimental groups.
We recruited individuals based on presence or absence of prostate cancer. 
Covariate information was collected and controlled in the regression 
models (i.e. age, recruitment center, country, etc.).
5.   Blinding
Describe whether the investigators were blinded to group allocation 
during data collection and/or analysis.
Blinding was not necessary in our study. This was a population-based 
observation study.
Note: all studies involving animals and/or human research participants must disclose whether blinding and randomization were used.
6.   Statistical parameters 
For all figures and tables that use statistical methods, confirm that the following items are present in relevant figure legends (or the Methods 
section if additional space is needed). 
n/a Confirmed
The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement (animals, litters, cultures, etc.)
A description of how samples were collected, noting whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample 
was measured repeatedly. 
A statement indicating how many times each experiment was replicated
The statistical test(s) used and whether they are one- or two-sided (note: only common tests should be described solely by name; more 
complex techniques should be described in the Methods section)
A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as an adjustment for multiple comparisons
The test results (e.g. p values) given as exact values whenever possible and with confidence intervals noted
A summary of the descriptive statistics, including central tendency (e.g. median, mean) and variation (e.g. standard deviation, interquartile range)
Clearly defined error bars

12. Description of human research participants
Describe the covariate-relevant population characteristics of the 
human research participants.
Our study was limited to males (due to disease). Cases were individuals 
diagnosed with prostate cancer. Controls were prostate cancer free at 
time of recruitment. All baseline information such as age, country of 
residence were collected. Average age and clinical features (where 
applicable) are reported in the manuscript by epidemiological study. 
Genotype summaries are reported.  
 
The OncoArray genotype data and relevant covariate information (i.e. 
ethnicity, country, principal components, etc.) generated during this study 
are currently being deposited into dbGAP for access (Accession #: 
phs001391.v1.p1; the submission is still underway). In total 47 of the 52 
OncoArray studies, encompassing nearly 90% of the individual samples, 
will be available (Supplementary Table 19). The previous meta-analysis 
summary results and genotype data currently are available in dbGAP 
(Accession #: phs001081.v1.p1). The complete meta-analysis summary 
associations statistics is publicly available at the PRACTICAL website
