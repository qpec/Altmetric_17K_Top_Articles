ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Patients with chronic heart failure (HF) secondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) are
frequently deficient in vitamin D. Low vitamin D levels are associated with a worse prognosis.
OBJECTIVES The VINDICATE (VitamIN D treatIng patients with Chronic heArT failurE) study was undertaken to
establish safety and efficacy of high-dose 25 (OH) vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation in patients with chronic
HF due to LVSD.
METHODS We enrolled 229 patients (179 men) with chronic HF due to LVSD and vitamin D deficiency
(cholecalciferol <50 nmol/l [<20 ng/ml]). Participants were allocated to 1 year of vitamin D3 supplementation (4,000 IU
[100 mg] daily) or matching non�calcium-based placebo. The primary endpoint was change in 6-minute walk distance
between baseline and 12 months. Secondary endpoints included change in LV ejection fraction at 1 year, and safety
measures of renal function and serum calcium concentration assessed every 3 months.
RESULTS One year of high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation did not improve 6-min walk distance at 1 year, but was
associated with a significant improvement in cardiac function (LV ejection fraction þ6.07% [95% confidence interval (CI):
3.20 to 8.95; p < 0.0001]); and a reversal of LV remodeling (LV end diastolic diameter -2.49 mm [95% CI: -4.09 to
-0.90; p ¼ 0.002] and LV end systolic diameter -2.09 mm [95% CI: -4.11 to -0.06 p ¼ 0.043]).
CONCLUSIONS One year of 100 mg daily vitamin D3 supplementation does not improve 6-min walk distance but
has beneficial effects on LV structure and function in patients on contemporary optimal medical therapy. Further
studies are necessary to determine whether these translate to improvements in outcomes. (VitamIN D Treating

hronic heart failure (HF) secondary to left
ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (LVSD)
is a common condition affecting 5 million in-
dividuals in the United States (1) and a similar
number in Western Europe (2). While the prognosis
of chronic HF has improved substantially during the
last 2 decades (3), mortality remains high with 50%
of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis (4,5).

 Patients
suffering
from
cardiovascular
disease are frequently deficient in the steroid
hormone vitamin D, and vitamin D deficiency
has been shown to be associated with the
development of chronic HF in a number of
studies (6–10). Approximately 90% of chronic
HF patients have hypovitaminosis D (11),
even in sunny climates (12). The agent has a
range of pleiotropic effects that in the setting
of chronic HF may impact on disease severity
(13,14), but despite this, clinical trials exam-
ining vitamin D supplementation in chronic
HF patients have to date been inconclusive
(15,16).
The
aim
of
the
VINDICATE
(VitamIN
D
treatIng patients with Chronic heArT failurE) study
was to describe the safety and efficacy of long-term,
high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation on submaxi-
mal exercise capacity and cardiac function in patients
with chronic HF due to LVSD.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION. VINDICATE was a randomized
placebo-controlled double-blind trial of vitamin D
supplementation in vitamin D�deficient chronic HF
patients
on
optimal
medical
therapy.
Patients
were eligible if they had stable (>3 months) New
York Heart Association functional class II or III symp-
toms, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) #45%
on maximally tolerated medical therapy (>3 months)
and a 25(OH) vitamin D level of <50 nmol/l (<20 ng/ml).
Patients were ineligible if they were taking or had
taken calcium or other vitamin supplements in the
last 3 months; if their chronic HF was due to un-
treated valvular heart disease, anemia or thyrotoxi-
cosis; if they had existing indications for vitamin D
supplementation (e.g., previous osteoporotic fracture
or symptoms of osteomalacia); if they had a history of
primary hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, tubercu-
losis or lymphoma, a cholecalciferol concentration at
the time of screening >50 nmol/l (20 ng/ml); or if
there was significant renal dysfunction (estimated
glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min).
ALLOCATION AND INTERVENTION. Patients enrolled
into VINDICATE were allocated in blocks of 20 using
minimization balancing for etiology of chronic HF
(ischemic/non-ischemic),
diabetes
mellitus,
sex,
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
(requiring
use of regular bronchodilators), and ethnic origin
(Caucasian/non-Caucasian).
Each
participant
was
asked to take 2 tablets per day providing either a total
of 100 mg cholecalciferol (4,000 IU daily) or placebo
(Cultech, Port Talbot, Wales, United Kingdom).
The supplement and dose were chosen based upon
guidelines for studies of vitamin D supplementation
(17). These guidelines suggest that studies should:
1) aim to replace physiological requirements, supple-
menting between 75 and 250 mg/day; 2) last at least 9
months; 3) supplement with vitamin D3 (not D2);
4) assay supplements for potency; 5) include a regular
serum measurement of 25(OH)D3 levels; and 6) aim to
achieve serum levels in patients on active therapy
between 100 and 160 nmol/l (40 ng/ml to 64 ng/ml).
Also, on the basis of recent data demonstrating the
adverse effect of hyperparathyroidism in chronic HF
(18), we chose a dose likely to suppress parathyroid
hormone (PTH) release. Our proof of concept study,
using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria and
protocol as VINDICATE, had previously demonstrated
the efficacy of 4,000 IU daily to achieve positive
remodeling with significant reductions in left ven-
tricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular
end-systolic volume (LVESV), and left ventricular end-
diastolic dimension (LVEDD). The consort diagram and
results from this study are presented in online sup-
plementary datasets (Online Figure 1, Online Tables 1
and 2). A simple linear model-based trend test from
this study demonstrated a significant decrease in PTH
over the year (p ¼ 0.0095) in those allocated vitamin D,
with no such trend in patients allocated to the placebo
arm (p ¼ 0.977) (Online Figure 2) (19).
OUTCOME
VARIABLES. The
pre-specified
primary
endpoint
in
VINDICATE
was
the
difference
in
change in 6-min walk test distance (6MWT) (base-
line
to
12
months)
between
the
2
groups.
Key
pre-specified secondary endpoints included cardiac
structure
and
function,
and
safety
endpoints
of
serum calcium concentration, renal function, and
vitamin D levels. Hypervitaminosis D was defined as
25(OH)D3 >200 nmol/l (80 ng/ml), and hypercalce-
mia as >2.6 nmol/l (10.4 mg/dl).
STUDY PROCEDURES. At baseline each patient per-
formed a 6MWT according to standard criteria (20).
Each patient also underwent echocardiography and
blood sampling for serum calcium, serum creatinine,
vitamin D, and PTH levels. Patients were also invited
to undergo cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imag-
ing to measure LV volumes. Subsequent visits took
place at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and blood draws were
repeated at each visit for safety data.
SERUM BIOCHEMISTRY. Serum 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3
were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Sam-
ples were prepared using a protein precipitation
reagent containing deuterated cholecalciferol. The

 supernatant was analyzed on an API5000 LC-MS/MS
(AB
SCIEX,
Warrington,
United
Kingdom)
in
atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization mode. The
inter-assay coefficient of variability was <10% at all
concentrations ranging from 12 nmol/l to 159 nmol/l
(4.8 ng/ml to 63.7 ng/ml). Ergocalciferol and cholecal-
ciferol concentrations were summed and reported as
total 25(OH)D. We defined deficiency and insufficiency
of vitamin D concentrations as <50 nmol/l (20 ng/ml)
and <75 nmol/l (30 ng/ml), respectively (21,22). We
also measured serum calcium, creatinine, and PTH
(Siemens Advia and Centaur, Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics, Camberley, United Kingdom). To confirm
effective conversion of the supplement, we also
measured
1,25(OH)D3
by
radioimmunoassay
(IDS,
Boldon, United Kingdom) at baseline and 12 months.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY. Echocardiography
was
per-
formed on all patients at baseline and LV function was
assessed according to European Society of Cardiology
criteria using Simpson’s biplane measure to deter-
mine LVEF (23). Echocardiography was repeated at 12
months. Echocardiograms at both time points were
analyzed offline at the end of the study by 2 senior
echocardiographers blinded to patient treatment.
CMR
IMAGING. CMR
studies
were
performed
on
dedicated 1.5-T or 3-T CMR systems (Philips Health-
care, Best, the Netherlands). The same system was
used for baseline and follow-up studies (at 12 months)
of
individual
patients.
A
multislice
multiphase
data set covering the entire left ventricle in 10 to
12 short axis slices was acquired using a validated
2-dimensional balanced steady-state free precession
pulse sequence (TR 2.8 ms, TE 1.4 ms, flip angle 55�,
spatial resolution 2.0 mm � 2.0 mm � 10 mm, no
interslice gap, 30 phases/cardiac cycle, 1 slice per
breath-hold). Offline analysis by an experienced CMR
observer using QMASS V7.0 software (Medis, Leiden,
the Netherlands) blinded to study allocation derived
end-diastolic and end-systolic LV volumes and LVEF.
SAMPLE SIZE. VINDICATE was powered to provide
information
on
the
patient-oriented
outcome
of
6MWT. A trial of iron supplementation in a similar
patient group had demonstrated that improvements
of 30 m to 40 m could be expected with this type of
intervention (24). We assumed, based upon our pre-
liminary data from a pilot study (19), that there would
be a change between the 2 groups at 12 months of
30 m. The SD of change in 6MWT was estimated from
these data; the upper limit of the 80% confidence in-
terval (CI) (estimated using bootstrapping) was used
in these calculations to allow for the small sample size
in the proof of concept. This determined that 210 pa-
tients were required to have 90% power to show a
difference in change in 6MWT of 28 m or more with 5%
significance (SD ¼ 62). We aimed to recruit 230 pa-
tients (115 per group) to allow for w10% dropout.
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. Differences
in
baseline
variables between allocations were tested using Stu-
dent t tests (continuous data) or the chi-square test
(categorical data). The analysis of primacy for the
main efficacy endpoints was based on analysis of
covariance linear models relating differences in the
final walk distance and imaging variables by treat-
ment allocation, adjusting for baselines values and
reported with 95% CIs (25). All significance tests were
2-sided and called significant at the 5% level. All
analyses
were
conducted
in
Stata
(version
14,
StataCorp., College Station, Texas).
ETHICAL AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS. A single
unblinded
observer
with
no
involvement
in
the
patients’ care or study follow-up (J.H.B.) reviewed
each vitamin D result at each time point for safety.
An
agreed
operating
procedure
for
any
subject
who developed a serum vitamin D concentration
>200 nmol/l (80 ng/ml) involved reducing the dose
of treatment from 2 to 1 tablets per day to maintain
patient blinding.
RESULTS
We
enrolled
229
patients
into
VINDICATE.
Six
patients were found to be ineligible at the baseline
visit, leaving 223 patients randomized to treatment.
Figure 1 describes patient recruitment and loss to
follow-up. A total of 163 patients completed the
study. Baseline characteristics divided by treatment
allocation are shown in Table 1. There were no
important clinical differences at baseline between
patients completing the study and those who drop-
ped out. The 2 groups of completing participants were
balanced for baseline clinical variables (Table 1).
The vitamin D3 supplement was well-tolerated and
achieved sustained normal serum 25(OH)D concen-
trations by 3 months post-randomization, indicating
excellent adherence to treatment (Figure 2). Patients
in the placebo arm had lower median concentra-
tions of 25(OH)D at 12-months post-randomization,
(24.5 nmol/l; range: 10.0 to 81.8 nmol/l [9.8 ng/ml;
range: 4 to 32.7 ng/ml]) than patients in the active
supplement arm (115 nmol/l; range: 17.8 to 193 nmol/l
[46 ng/ml; range: 7.1 to 77.2 ng/ml]; p < 0.0001) con-
firming the effectiveness of the vitamin D supple-
mentation
in
normalizing
vitamin
D
levels.
The
supplement also effectively normalized 1,25 (OH)2
vitamin D3 (calcitriol) levels to 121 pmol/l (range: 40 to
331 pmol/l [46.5 pg/ml; range: 15.4 to 127.3 pg/ml]) at
12 months and also suppressed PTH levels, leading to

 lower PTH levels in subjects allocated vitamin D
(8.70 pmol/l; range: 1.28 to 22.2 pmol/l [82 ng/ml,
range: 12 to 209 ng/ml]) than those allocated placebo
(10.80 pmol/l; range: 2.80 to 53.10 pmol/l [102 ng/ml,
range: 26 to 499 ng/ml]); analysis of covariance
difference in mean change was -3.63 pmol/l, 95% CI:
-5.24 to -2.03 pmol/l (-34 ng/ml, 95% CI: -49 to
-19 ng/ml); p < 0.0001.
No patient was observed to suffer hypervitamin-
osis D according to our pre-specified safety con-
centration of 200 nmol/l (80 ng/ml) 25(OH)D and
no subject required a down-titration of dose. One
patient with borderline hypercalcemia at baseline
(2.66 mmol/l [10.64 mg/dl]) had persistent hypercal-
cemia throughout the study, and 1 other patient with
hypercalcemia at 3 months (2.73 mmol/l [10.9 mg/dl])
had
a
normal
calcium
level
by
6
months
and
throughout the remainder of the study (Figure 2).
There was no concerning change in renal function
(Figure 2) and there were no study drug-related
admissions or adverse events. Twelve months of
4,000 IU of cholecalciferol did not improve or preserve
6MWT distance in chronic HF patients (Figure 3).
At 12 months, patients in the vitamin D arm had a
greater improvement in echocardiographic measures
of LV function compared with patients randomized to
placebo. Changes in the treatment versus placebo arms
were as follows: for LVEF þ7.65% (95% CI: 5.21% to
10.09%) and þ1.36% (95% CI: -0.38%
to 3.11%),
respectively (p < 0.0001); for LVEDD -2.45 mm (95% CI:
-3.70 to -1.21 mm) and 0.08 mm (95% CI: -1.25 to 1.10
mm), respectively (p ¼ 0.002); and for LVESD were
-2.72 mm (95% CI: -4.52 to -0.92 mm) and -0.99 mm
(95% CI: -2.31 to 0.33 mm), respectively (p ¼ 0.043).
Changes in LV volumes in the treatment versus the
placebo arms were: LVEDV -16.47 ml (95% CI: -25.71 to
-7.22 ml) and -3.83 ml (95% CI: -13.36 to 5.70 ml),
respectively (p ¼ 0.04); and LVESV -18.77 ml (95% CI:
-25.96 to 9.59 ml) and -8.49 ml (95% CI: -17.98 to
1.01 ml), respectively (p ¼ 0.041) (Table 2, Figure 3).
There was a dose-response relationship between the
increase in vitamin D levels and the increase in LVEF

Enrollment into VINDICATE did not mandate CMR
imaging, and one-third of patients in VINDICATE had
cardiac devices incompatible with CMR imaging. Only
69 patients volunteered to undergo baseline CMR
scanning. The CMR data are further limited as a result
of withdrawal or death during follow-up (n ¼ 8), device
implantation between baseline and follow-up (n ¼ 2
implantable
cardioverter
defibrillators),
patient
refusal to undergo a second scan (n ¼ 17), and technical
problems with the second scan, such that we only had
34 patients with serial CMR images. Baseline charac-
teristics of these patients are shown in Online Table 3.
Patients agreeing to serial CMR scans were younger
(61.5 years [range: 36.7 to 84.8 years] vs. 71.3 years
[range: 28.1 to 92.3 years]; p < 0.0001) had better
renal function (creatinine: 86 mmol/l [range: 43 to
114 mmol/l] vs. 102 mmol/l [range: 48 to 245 mmol/l];
p ¼ 0.007) and were non-significantly less deficient in
25-(OH) vitamin D at baseline (43.9 nmol/l [range: 10.0
to 90.4 nmol/l] vs. 35.94 nmol/l [range: 10.0 to
111.0 nmol/l] or 17.6 ng/ml [range: 4.0 to 36.2 ng/ml] vs.
14.4 ng/ml [range: 4.0 to 44.4 ng/ml]; p ¼ 0.07), but
were otherwise similar to patients who declined CMR
scanning including the change in vitamin D from
baseline to completion (p ¼ 0.64). The data from serial
CMR scans showed improvements in cardiac function
with vitamin D, but were not statistically significant
possibly due to insufficient statistical power: for LVEF
4.12% (95% CI: -0.11% to 8.35%) versus 1.19% (95% CI:
-3.20% to 5.59%; p ¼ 0.317), for LVEDV -26.12 ml
(95% CI: -63.27 to 11.04 ml) versus –0.10 ml (95% CI:
-12.88 to 13.07 ml; p ¼ 0.168) and for LV -29.61 ml
(95% CI: -72.40 to 13.18 ml) versus –1.36 ml (95% CI:
-19.19 to 16.48 ml; p ¼ 0.206). There was however, a
dose response relationship in our CMR data, with a
relationship between increases in vitamin D and
reductions in LVEDV (coefficient -0.19; p ¼ 0.050) and
LVESV (coefficient -0.20; p ¼ 0.083).
DISCUSSION
VINDICATE aimed to examine the effect of high-dose
vitamin D3 supplementation in patients with chronic
HF secondary to LVSD who underwent optimal med-
ical therapy. The results demonstrate that 4,000 IU
vitamin D3 given for 12 months is safe, well tolerated,
and not associated with concerning adverse bio-
chemical effects (Central Illustration).
There was no effect of vitamin D supplementation
on the primary endpoint of 6MWT distance but there
were statistically significant and prognostically and
clinically relevant improvements in the secondary
outcomes of LVEF and LV dimensions and volumes,
thus suggesting that vitamin D is leading to beneficial
reverse remodeling.
New
therapies
for
serious
chronic
conditions
including chronic HF are often expensive, increasingly
technical, and frequently fail to meet the rigorous
demands of large phase 3 clinical trials. Vitamin D
might be an inexpensive and safe additional option for
chronic HF patients and may have beneficial effects on
multiple features of the syndrome (13).
Patients with chronic HF are frequently deficient in
vitamin D, and low vitamin D levels increase the risk
of incident chronic HF (26), and are associated with
more severe disease and worse outcomes in patients
with chronic HF (6–9,12). Supplementation to treat or

 et al. (28,29) did not demonstrate improvements in
cardiac function or objective measures of muscle
strength and exercise capacity in 64 chronic HF
patients (of whom 34 underwent echocardiography)
randomized to weekly doses of 50,000 IU of vitamin
D3 for 6 months, there was an improvement in serum
aldosterone and quality of life in those allocated the
supplement. In an open-label study, Schroten et al.
(30) demonstrated a reduction in plasma renin con-
centration after 6 weeks of 2,000 IU vitamin D3 daily
in 101 patients with chronic HF. Finally, Dalbeni et al.
(31) noted an increase in LVEF of almost 7% after only
25 weeks in 13 patients randomized to 600,000 IU
vitamin D3 at baseline and 2 further doses of 100,000 IU
at 10 weeks and 20 weeks, whereas 10 patients ran-
domized to placebo had a reduction in LVEF of more
than 4%. The authors did not comment on cardiac di-
mensions and there was an increase in natriuretic
peptide levels in both groups. In contrast to these
studies,
VINDICATE
is
a
double-blind,
placebo-
controlled study of an oral non�calcium-based daily
supplement of 4,000 IU of vitamin D3 administered for
12 months in patients with chronic HF due to LVSD on
otherwise optimal medical therapy. The supplement
led to consistent biochemical evidence of replenish-
ment and an effective suppression of PTH levels.
The primary endpoint of VINDICATE was change in
6MWT distance. The study was based upon pilot
data and powered to detect a 28-m difference be-
tween the 2 groups at 12 months (19). The variability
in the walk distance measure at baseline was much
greater than predicted from our pilot study, such that
our sample size only had 7% post hoc power to detect
a difference between the groups. VINDICATE was
therefore underpowered to detect a clinically relevant
change in walk distance. Six-minute walk distance is
an
increasingly
frequently
used
patient-oriented
outcome measure, but has greater variability than
objective surrogate endpoints (20). The findings from
VINDICATE have implications for future studies using
6-min walk distance as an outcome measure.
However,
our
secondary
endpoints
of
cardiac
function and structure measured by echocardiogra-
phy were highly statistically and clinically significant,
with improvements in LVEF, and LV dimensions and
volumes. Similar changes were seen in a subgroup of
patients agreeing to serial CMR imaging, although
they did not reach conventional levels of statistical
significance due to lack of power.
A pathophysiological hallmark of chronic HF sec-
ondary to LVSD is a progressive increase in LV cavity
dimensions and impaired contractility, a process
known as LV remodeling (32). Current accepted ther-
apies
for
chronic
HF
which
afford
HF
patients
improvements in survival such as angiotensin con-
verting enzyme inhibitors (33), beta-adrenoceptor
antagonists (34,35), and cardiac resynchronization
therapy (36) have also been shown to have a favorable
effect on LV remodeling by delaying progression of, or
reversing LV dilatation. The degree of favorable
remodeling induced by these treatments is related to
long-term outcomes (37). It is therefore plausible that
the improvements in cardiac function demonstrated in
VINDICATE have the potential to improve outcomes.
HOW DOES VITAMIN D CONTRIBUTE TO BENEFICIAL
REMODELING? Vitamin D deficiency could contribute
to adverse remodeling through 2 major pathways.
Vitamin D deficiency could lead to cardiomyocyte
dysfunction by interfering with Ca2þ transport (38) at a
cellular concentration. HF is a condition of intracel-
lular calcium overload that adversely affects both
contraction and relaxation. Furthermore, vitamin D
deficiency might contribute to cardiomyocyte hyper-
trophy, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis (39).
Hence, vitamin D deficiency could contribute to a more
rapid progression to HF following myocardial damage
due to more aggressive adverse remodeling (40).
However, adverse remodeling is also the result of
persistent neurohormonal activation, particularly that
of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS)
which strongly contributes to deteriorating cardiac
function, cardiomyocyte loss, and interstitial fibrosis
(41). Inhibition of the RAAS leads to attenuated or
reverse LV remodeling in patients with HF (42).
Vitamin D deficiency heightens RAAS activity (30,43),
whereas vitamin D supplementation seems to reduce
renin synthesis (44) and plasma renin activity (43).
STUDY LIMITATIONS. VINDICATE was performed at a
single center. However, the study was based upon re-
sults from a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot
study in 53 patients using the same dose for 12 months
that also showed a favorable effect of vitamin D on
cardiac structure and function (19). We did not examine
the effect of vitamin D supplementation in patients
with chronic HF and preserved ejection fraction, a
group of patients who may warrant such investigation.
CONCLUSIONS
VINDICATE has demonstrated that high-dose vitamin
D3 supplementation is safe, well-tolerated, and asso-
ciated with a clinically relevant improvement in car-
diac function in chronic HF patients already taking
current optimal therapies.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND
PROCEDURAL SKILLS: In patients with chronic HF,
vitamin D deficiency is common, and high-dose
vitamin D3 supplementation is safe, well tolerated, and
associated with a favorable effect on cardiac function.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are
needed to establish the mechanism by which correc-
tion of vitamin D3 deficiency improves cardiac function
in patients with systolic HF and the generalizability of
this response.
