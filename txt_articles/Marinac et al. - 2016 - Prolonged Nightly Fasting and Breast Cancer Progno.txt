IMPORTANCE Rodent studies demonstrate that prolonged fasting during the sleep phase
positively influences carcinogenesis and metabolic processes that are putatively associated
with risk and prognosis of breast cancer. To our knowledge, no studies in humans have
examined nightly fasting duration and cancer outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether duration of nightly fasting predicted recurrence and
mortality among women with early-stage breast cancer and, if so, whether it was associated
with risk factors for poor outcomes, including glucoregulation (hemoglobin A1c), chronic
inflammation (C-reactive protein), obesity, and sleep.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were collected from 2413 women with breast
cancer but without diabetes mellitus who were aged 27 to 70 years at diagnosis and
participated in the prospective Women’
s Healthy Eating and Living study between March 1,
1995, and May 3, 2007. Data analysis was conducted from May 18 to October 5, 2015.
EXPOSURES Nightly fasting duration was estimated from 24-hour dietary recalls collected at
baseline, year 1, and year 4.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical outcomes were invasive breast cancer recurrence
and new primary breast tumors during a mean of 7.3 years of study follow-up as well as death
from breast cancer or any cause during a mean of 11.4 years of surveillance. Baseline sleep
duration was self-reported, and archived blood samples were used to assess concentrations
of hemoglobin A1c and C-reactive protein.
RESULTS The cohort of 2413 women (mean [SD] age, 52.4 [8.9] years) reported a mean (SD)
fasting duration of 12.5 (1.7) hours per night. In repeated-measures Cox proportional hazards
regression models, fasting less than 13 hours per night (lower 2 tertiles of nightly fasting
distribution) was associated with an increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence compared
with fasting 13 or more hours per night (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05-1.76). Nightly fasting
less than 13 hours was not associated with a statistically significant higher risk of breast cancer
mortality (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.91-1.60) or a statistically significant higher risk of
all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.95-1.56). In multivariable linear regression
models, each 2-hour increase in the nightly fasting duration was associated with significantly
lower hemoglobin A1c levels (β = –0.37; 95% CI, –0.72 to –0.01) and a longer duration of
nighttime sleep (β = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.14-0.26).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Prolonging the length of the nightly fasting interval may be a
simple, nonpharmacologic strategy for reducing the risk of breast cancer recurrence.
Improvements in glucoregulation and sleep may be mechanisms linking nightly fasting with
breast cancer prognosis.

reast cancer is the most common cause of cancer mor-
tality among women in developing countries and the
second most common cause of cancer mortality in de-
veloped countries.1 While it is often presumed that a healthy
diet will improve breast cancer outcomes, data on this hypoth-
esis are mixed.2-5 Much of the research has focused on what
to eat to prevent cancer, such as specific foods, food groups,
ordietarypatterns.Recently,anoveltheoremhasemergedthat
when we eat also matters, with research showing that the tim-
ing of food intake influences metabolic health and cancer.6-10

lism, inflammation, and weight gain, all of which are associ-

To our knowledge, epidemiologic data on nightly fasting
durationandclinicaloutcomesarenonexistent.However,there
are limited data from small trials in humans suggesting that
many types of intermittent fasting regimens positively affect
risk factors for poor breast cancer outcomes, such as gluco-
regulation, inflammation, obesity, and sleep.8 Two analyses
have been published of nightly fasting duration and bio-
markers of breast cancer risk in women using US National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. In the first
analysis, among 2122 women without diabetes mellitus,
longer nightly fasting was associated with significant
improvements in biomarkers of glycemic control.9 In the
second analysis, a longer duration of nightly fasting was
associated with significantly lower C-reactive protein (CRP)
concentrations in women who eat less than 30% of their
total daily energy intake after 5 PM.10 Taken together, the
rodent and human data support the hypothesis that a pro-
longed nightly fasting interval could reduce cancer risk and
improve cancer outcomes.
The Women’
s Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) study of
patients with breast cancer offers a unique opportunity to ex-
amine the influence of nightly fasting because dietary intake
was assessed with 24-hour dietary recalls that documented
timing of food consumption. We used data from the WHEL
study to investigate whether a woman’
s usual nightly fasting
duration was associated with breast cancer recurrence and
mortality. We also examined mechanisms by which pro-
longed nightly fasting might improve breast cancer progno-
sis, such as glucoregulation, inflammation, obesity, and sleep.
Methods
Study Design and Sample
The WHEL study is a multisite randomized trial conducted
between March 1, 1995, and May 3, 2007, enrolling 3088 pa-
tientswhorecentlyhadearly-stageinvasivebreastcancer.This
trial aimed to test whether a diet rich in vegetables, fruit, and
fiber and low in fat reduced the risk of breast cancer recur-
rence and mortality. The dietary intervention did not alter
breast cancer prognosis during the trial’
s mean 7.3-year
follow-up3; therefore, this investigation treats the WHEL study
sample as a single cohort.
To be eligible for this analysis, women had time-
stamped, 24-hour dietary recall data and complete data on key
confounders (eg, breast cancer stage, age, or comorbidity sta-
tus). This analysis excluded women who reported diabetes at
baseline because antidiabetic treatments may confound as-
sociations between lifestyle and breast cancer outcomes.13,14
The institutional review boards at each clinical site (Univer-
sity of California, San Diego; University of California, Davis;
Stanford University; Kaiser Permanente, Northern Califor-
nia; M.D. Anderson Cancer Center; Arizona Cancer Center; and
Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research) approved the
study protocol and consent forms, and all participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
Dietary Assessment
At baseline, year 1, and year 4, dietary intake was assessed by
multiple prescheduled, 24-hour dietary recalls collected by
telephone on random days during a 3-week period, stratified
forweekendvsweekdays.15Of2413participantsinthissample,
2400 (99.5%) completed 3 or more dietary recalls at baseline,
2203 (91.3%) completed 3 or more recalls at year 1, and 1924
(79.7%) completed 3 or more recalls at year 4. Collectively,
25 325 dietary recalls were available for use in this analysis.
Nightly fasting duration was estimated by calculating the
elapsedhoursbetweenthefirstandlasteatingepisodeforeach
day and subtracting this time from 24 hours. Potential di-
etary confounders identified from the literature included daily
intake (in kilocalories), eating episodes per day, and eating af-
ter 8 PM. Eating episodes per day were defined as the number
of times participants consumed 25 kcal or more at a single
time point. We also created an indicator variable for indi-
viduals who consumed 25 kcal or more after 8 PM (referred
to as eating after 8 PM).
Other Assessments
Medical records were abstracted for information related to
the initial breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, such as
stage, grade, hormone receptor status, and use of radio-
therapy, chemotherapy, or endocrine therapy (eg, tamoxi-
fen). Demographic characteristics and comorbidities were
self-reported. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and CRP were
measured in blood specimens collected at the baseline clinic
visit using standard procedures.16,17
Key Points
Question Does duration of nightly fasting predict breast cancer
prognosis?
Findings In this cohort of 2413 patients with early-stage breast
cancer, nightly fasting less than 13 hours was associated with a
statistically significant 36% increased risk of breast cancer
recurrence compared with nightly fasting more than 13 hours but
was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of
breast cancer–specific and all-cause mortality.
Meaning Prolonging the length of the nightly fasting interval may
be a dietary strategy to reduce risk of breast cancer recurrence in
women.

Height, weight, physical activity levels, and sleep dura-
tion were measured at baseline, year 1, and year 4. Physical ac-
tivity levels were measured using a validated questionnaire
adapted from the Women’
s Health Initiative.18 Sleep dura-
tion was estimated by asking participants, “About how many
hours of sleep did you get on a typical night during the past 4
weeks?”
Clinical Outcomes
Breast cancer recurrence was ascertained through active
surveillance (semiannual telephone calls) during a mean of
7.3 years of follow-up. Breast cancer recurrence was defined
as the combination outcome of invasive breast cancer recur-
rence (local, regional, or distal) or new primary invasive
breast cancer. The breast cancer recurrence–free interval
was defined as the date of original breast cancer diagnosis
to development of a new breast cancer event or the end of
study follow-up.
Participant deaths were ascertained via periodic review of
the Social Security Death Index for a mean of 11.4 years. Cause
of death was obtained from death certificates of each dece-
dent, which listed the primary cause of death. In some cases,
a contributing cause of death was also listed. Using this
information, the WHEL data management coordinator used
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision cod-
ing to generate 4 categories for cause of death: breast can-
cer, other cancer, cardiovascular disease, or other cause. All
breast cancer deaths were confirmed by the study oncolo-
gist. Survival was assessed as the time from cancer diagno-
sis to death or the most recent available review of the Social
Security Death Index.
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was conducted from May 18 to October 5, 2015.
The repeated measurements of nightly fasting duration at
baseline, year 1, and year 4 were analyzed by modeling them
as time-varying covariates19 using Cox proportional hazards
regression. These models used delayed entry to account for
the interval between breast cancer diagnosis and entry to the
WHEL study and controlled for the following variables
selected a priori based on their known association with
breast cancer prognosis and/or nightly fasting duration:
demographics, number of comorbidities, tumor stage and
grade, treatment with radiotherapy, tamoxifen use, and
menopausal status, as well as other potential dietary con-
founders (eg, number of eating episodes per day, eating after
8 PM, or kilocalorie intake). We also adjusted for study design
variables, including WHEL intervention group, and study
site. We investigated adjusting for other breast cancer–related
or diet-related variables, such as estrogen and progesterone
receptor status, total fat and carbohydrate intake, and dietary
index scores. However, because these variables did not
change the nightly fasting hazard ratios by more than 10%,
they were not included in the multivariable adjusted models.
Our primary exposure of nightly fasting duration was catego-
rized using tertile cut points for ease of interpretation. We
combined the bottom 2 tertiles because there was no evi-
dence of a dose-response association below the upper tertile.
The proportional hazards assumption was examined and sat-
isfied in all Cox proportional hazards regression models by
testing the significance of the product terms for our variable
of interest and log time.
Linear regression models were used to examine the cross-
sectional associations of baseline nightly fasting duration with
the baseline metabolic and lifestyle variables hypothesized to
link nightly fasting duration with breast cancer outcomes:
HbA1c, CRP, body mass index (BMI), and sleep.16,17,20-22 For
consistency, these linear regression models controlled for the
same covariates as the Cox proportional hazards regression
models described above. To enhance interpretability of the
parameter estimates, we used a 2-hour (approximately 1 SD)
unit of analysis for the nightly fasting duration variable.
C-reactive protein was log transformed to better approximate
a gaussian distribution. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and
α was set at P < .05.
Results
The sample consisted of 2413 patients with breast cancer but
without diabetes, with a mean (SD) age of 52.4 (8.9) years and
a BMI (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared) of 27.0 (5.9) (Table 1). A total of 2064 partici-
pants (85.5%) were white and 1335 (55.3%) were college edu-
cated. Participants reported a mean (SD) nightly fasting dura-
tion of 12.5 (1.7) hours and 4.4 (1.2) eating episodes per day.
One-third of the sample (788 [32.7%]) consumed 25 kcal or
more after 8 PM. A short nightly fasting duration (<13 hours per
night) was significantly associated with college education, a
lower BMI, shorter sleep duration, higher self-reported kilo-
calorie intake, more eating episodes, and eating after 8 PM
(Table 1).
In repeated-measures Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion models, a short nightly fast was significantly associated
with an increased risk for breast cancer recurrence. Specifi-
cally, fasting fewer than 13 hours per night was associated with
a 36% higher hazard for breast cancer recurrence compared
with fasting 13 or more hours per night (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95%
CI, 1.05-1.76) (Table 2). Short nightly fasting duration was not
associated with a higher hazard for breast cancer-specific mor-
tality (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.91-1.60) or a higher hazard
for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.95-1.56).
We also examined these associations using competing risk
models and the result remained unchanged.
Table 3 provides a cross-sectional analysis of biomarkers
and mechanisms postulated to link nightly fasting duration
with breast cancer prognosis. Each 2-hour increase in nightly
fasting duration was statistically significantly associated with
a 0.37-mmol/mol lower HbA1c level (β = –0.37; 95% CI, –0.72
to –0.01) and more hours of sleep per night (β = 0.20; 95% CI,
0.14-0.26). Nightly fasting duration was not associated with
BMI or CRP concentrations. With regard to dietary behaviors
related to nightly fasting, each additional daily eating epi-
sode was associated with significantly lower HbA1c and CRP
concentrations and lower BMI. Eating after 8 PM was associ-
ated with significantly higher CRP concentrations and BMI.

Discussion
In this large prospective cohort of patients with early-stage
breast cancer, a short nightly fasting duration (<13 hours per
night) was associated with a 36% higher hazard for breast can-
cer recurrence. Short nightly fasting was not associated with
statistically significant increased risk of early mortality. To our
knowledge, this is the first human study to examine the asso-
ciation between nightly fasting and cancer outcomes.
There are limited animal data on the association of time-
restricted feeding and tumorigenesis. However, in rodents,
calorie restriction is an effective way to reduce cancer and
cancer-related risk factors,23,24 and studies suggest that inter-
mittent calorie restriction prevents mammary tumor devel-
opment to a similar, or even greater, extent than chronic calo-
rie restriction.25,26 To our knowledge, only 1 study has tested
the effect of meal timing on tumor progression in mice27: those
with time-restricted feeding regimens had a lower mean
tumor weight compared with mice with ad libitum feeding.

However, mice on these same time-restricted feeding regi-
mens who were fed during the 12-hour period of light expo-
sure had a lower tumor weight than mice fed during darkness
(mice are nocturnal). The authors hypothesized that meal tim-
ing during light exposure produced an internal desynchroni-
zation that slowed tumor progression. More and better-
quality animal studies are needed to provide mechanistic data
on time-restricted feeding and cancer risk.
Positive metabolic changes associated with intermittent
fasting regimens include improved glucoregulation.8 In this
WHEL study cohort, longer nightly fasting duration and more
frequenteatingwereassociatedwithasignificantlylowerHbA1c
level, consistent with a previous analysis of 2212 women in the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.9 As noted
in the American Diabetes Association/American Cancer Soci-
ety consensus report on diabetes and cancer risk,14 there may
be a subset of tumors for which hyperglycemia confers a
growth advantage. Several studies have reported associa-
tions between diabetes and/or hyperglycemia and breast
cancer prognosis.16,28,29 An analysis of patients with breast
cancer in the WHEL cohort found that, compared with
women whose HbA1c was less than 6.5%, the risk of all-
cause mortality was twice as high in women whose HbA1c
was 7.0% or more (hazard ratio, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.56-3.54), and
there was a nonsignificant 30% increase in the risk of breast
cancer recurrence.16
Althoughrodentstudiesindicatethattime-restrictedfeed-
ing can reduce markers of inflammation,11,30 our study found
no association between length of nightly fasting and CRP con-
centration in patients with breast cancer. Nonetheless, a re-
cent analysis of 2019 adult women in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey showed that a longer nightly
fasting duration was associated with significantly lower CRP
concentrations, but only in women who ate less than 30% of
their daily calories after 5 PM.10
Many trials of intermittent fasting in humans have dem-
onstrated that fasting regimens lead to modest weight loss.8
However, we found no connection between nightly fasting and
BMI, suggesting that the positive effects of prolonged nightly
fasting on HbA1c and breast cancer prognosis may be indepen-
dent of BMI.
Finally, prolonged nightly fasting and more frequent eat-
ing were associated with significantly longer sleep duration in
our study. Consuming food at abnormal times (eg, late at night)
can result in misalignment of circadian rhythms, which can
influence sleep patterns and disrupt metabolic factors, such
as glucoregulation. Notably, circadian misalignment has been
linked to increased risk of many cancers, as evidenced by the
well-documented association between shift work and in-
creased risk of breast cancer.31-34
A unique strength of this study was the assessment of the
nightly fasting interval by use of multiple 24-hour recalls col-
lected at several study time points (baseline, year 1, and year
4). The use of multiple assessments of nightly fasting dura-
tion reduced within-person variability in our exposure
measure.35 In addition, this design enabled use of a repeated-
measures analysis to analyze the dietary data in Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models,19 which increased study
power relative to sample size. Nonetheless, the use of self-
reported dietary data is also a limitation, as recalls are prone

to numerous biases.36 However, it is unknown whether self-
reported timing of energy intake is susceptible to similar bi-
ases. We also relied on self-reported data for sleep duration,
physical activity, and comorbidities, which may be subject to
error. In addition, although ERBB2 (also known as Her2/neu
[GenBank X03363.1]) status has become a well-recognized in-
dicator of breast cancer prognosis and response to systemic
therapies, the test for ERBB2 was not a standard of care pro-
cedure at the time of study inception. As a result, informa-
tion on ERBB2 status was not available for a sizeable number
of WHEL participants, and this variable was not included as a
covariateinstatisticalmodels.Finally,ourstudyincludedmul-
tiple primary end points for breast cancer prognosis (ie, breast
cancer recurrence, breast cancer–specific mortality, and all-
cause mortality). Because this was an exploratory analysis of
a novel association for a modifiable risk factor, we did not ad-
just for multiple comparisons. Therefore, there could be an in-
creased probability of a type I error.
Conclusions
Our study introduces a novel dietary intervention strategy and
indicates that prolonging the length of the nightly fasting in-
terval could be a simple and feasible strategy to reduce breast
cancer recurrence. In this cohort of patients with early-stage
breast cancer, a longer nightly fasting interval was also asso-
ciated with significantly lower concentrations of HbA1c and
longer sleep duration. Given the associations of nightly fast-
ing with glycemic control and sleep, we hypothesize that
interventions to prolong the nightly fasting interval could
potentially reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, and other cancers. Thus, findings from this study
have broad and significant implications for public health.
Randomized trials are needed to adequately test whether
prolonging the nightly fasting interval can reduce the risk of
chronic disease.
