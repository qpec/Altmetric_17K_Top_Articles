This report
 presents
 results  of  a randomized
 trial  of  a state  prekindergarten
 program.
 Low-income
children
 (N  =  2990)  applying
 to
 oversubscribed
 programs
 were  randomly
 assigned
 to
 receive  offers
 of
admission
 or  remain
 on  a
 waiting  list.  Data  from
 pre-k  through
 3rd  grade
 were  obtained  from
 state  edu-
cation
 records;
 additional
 data  were  collected
 for  a  subset
 of  children
 with
 parental
 consent
 (N =  1076).  At
the
 end of pre-k,  pre-k  participants
 in  the  consented
 subsample
 performed
 better  than
 control
 children
on
 a battery  of  achievement
 tests,  with  non-native
 English  speakers
 and
 children
 scoring  lowest  at  base-
line
 showing
 the  greatest
 gains.
 During  the  kindergarten
 year  and  thereafter,
 the  control
 children
 caught
up
 with
 the  pre-k  participants
 on  those
 tests
 and  generally
 surpassed
 them.
 Similar  results
 appeared
on
 the 3rd  grade
 state  achievement
 tests  for  the  full  randomized
 sample  – pre-k  participants
 did
 not
perform
 as  well  as the  control  children.  Teacher
 ratings
 of  classroom
 behavior
 did  not  favor  either group
overall,
 though
 some  negative
 treatment
 effects  were  seen
 in  1st  and 2nd  grade. There  were  differential
positive
 pre-k  effects  for  male  and Black  children
 on  a
 few  ratings
 and  on  attendance.
 Pre-k  participants
had
 lower  retention
 rates  in  kindergarten
 that  did  not  persist,  and  higher
 rates  of  school
 rule violations
in
 later
 grades.
 Many  pre-k  participants
 received
 special
 education
 designations
 that  remained
 through
later
 years,  creating
 higher  rates  than  for  control  children.
 Issues
 raised
 by  these  findings
 and
 implications
for
 pre-k  policy
 are  discussed.

In
 2015,
 67%
 of
 U.S.
 children
 4
 years
 old
 and
 not
 in
 kindergarten
were
 enrolled
 in
 preschool
 programs
 (McFarland
 et
 al.,
 2017).
 As
 in
years
 past,
 higher
 income
 families
 were
 more
 likely
 to
 enroll
 their
children
 in
 some
 form
 of
 center-based
 care
 than
 low-income
 fam-
ilies,
 and
 low-income
 children
 were
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 enrolled
 in
public
 programs
 such
 as
 Head
 Start
 and
 state-funded
 prekinder-
garten
 programs.
 Many
 states
 have
 been
 prompted
 to
 increase
funding
 for
 pre-k
 programs
 in
 order
 to
 serve
 a
 greater
 number
 of
high-risk
 children
 (Parker,
 Workman,
 &
 Atchison,
 2016)
 and
 most
states
 currently
 offer
 some
 form
 of
 voluntary
 pre-k
 that
 is
 available
to
 children
 from
 low-income
 families
 (Barnett
 et
 al.,
 2017).
State
 funding
 targeted
 to
 children
 from
 low-income
 families
implies
 goals
 beyond
 merely
 providing
 daycare.
 For
 example,
Mississippi
 began

 In
 2014–2015,
 the
 U.S.
 Department
 of
 Education
allocated
 millions
 of
 dollars
 to
 states
 to
 expand
 pre-k,
 citing
 a
white
 paper
 asserting
 that
 high
 quality
 early
 education
 narrows
achievement
 gaps,
 boosts
 adult
 earnings,
 and
 results
 in
 savings
 of
$8.60
 for
 every
 $1
 spent
 (Executive
 Office
 of
 the
 President
 of
 the
United
 States,
 2014).
 With
 such
 high
 expectations,
 it
 is
 especially
important
 for
 policy
 to
 be
 informed
 by
 research
 on
 the
 effects
 of
state-funded
 pre-k.
1.
 Pre-k
 effects
 at
 kindergarten
 entry
One
 relevant
 body
 of
 evidence
 demonstrates
 that
 state
 pre-k
programs
 generally
 improve
 such
 aspects
 of
 children’s
 readiness
 for
kindergarten
 as
 letter
 recognition
 and
 print
 awareness
 (Gormley,
Gayer,
 Phillips,
 &
 Dawson,
 2005;
 Wong,
 Cook,
 Barnett,
 &
 Jung,
2008).
 Most
 of
 what
 is
 known
 about
 these
 immediate
 pre-k
 effects
comes
 from
 age-cutoff
 regression-discontinuity
 designs
 (RDD).
Though
 not
 without
 potential
 biases
 (Lipsey,
 Weiland,
 Yoshikawa,
Wilson,
 &
 Hofer,
 2015),
 this
 design
 has
 the
 twofold
 advantage
 of
being
 recognized
 as
 a
 relatively
 strong
 design
 while
 also
 being
easily
 applied
 to
 any
 program
 with
 an
 age
 cutoff
 for
 admission.

 with
 birthdays
 on
 one
 side
 of
 the
 cutoff
 are
 admitted;
 those
 on
the
 other
 side
 must
 wait
 until
 the
 following
 year.
 The
 outcomes
 of
interest
 can
 be
 measured
 after
 the
 admitted
 group
 completes
 pre-
k,
 and
 the
 group
 in
 waiting
 is
 just
 beginning,
 and
 then
 compared
with
 statistical
 adjustments
 for
 the
 age
 difference.
The
 age-cutoff
 RDD
 was
 first
 used
 in
 an
 evaluation
 of
 the
 Tulsa
pre-k
 program
 that
 found
 positive
 effects
 (Gormley
 et
 al.,
 2005).
A
 number
 of
 similar
 age-cutoff
 RDD
 studies
 have
 been
 conducted
since
 and
 have
 almost
 universally
 found
 positive
 effects
 (Wong
et
 al.,
 2008).
 A
 recent
 example
 is
 the
 age-cutoff
 RDD
 study
 of
 the
program
 in
 Boston
 carried
 out
 by
 Weiland
 and
 Yoshikawa
 (2013)
that
 has
 received
 attention
 for
 its
 very
 positive
 findings.
 A
 disad-
vantage
 of
 the
 RDD,
 however,
 is
 that
 it
 does
 not
 allow
 investigation
of
 pre-k
 effects
 after
 entry
 into
 kindergarten
 because,
 by
 then,
 the
control
 group
 has
 also
 completed
 pre-k.
These
 studies
 demonstrate
 that
 state-funded
 pre-k
 programs
can
 produce
 positive
 effects
 on
 various
 target
 outcomes
 prior
to
 kindergarten
 entry.
 However,
 questions
 about
 the
 nature
of
 the
 effects
 have
 been
 raised.
 This
 research
 has
 focused
 on
basic
 pre-reading
 skills,
 but
 the
 influence
 of
 pre-k
 programs
 on
other
 outcomes
 pertinent
 to
 children’s
 cognitive
 and
 behavioral
development,
 such
 as
 complex
 language
 skills,
 mathematics,
 self-
regulation,
 and
 social
 skills,
 is
 less
 clear
 (Gormley
 et
 al.,
 2005;
Jackson
 et
 al.,
 2007).
 Skills
 of
 this
 latter
 sort
 may
 be
 more
 critical
 for
children’s
 long-term
 performance
 in
 school
 and
 beyond
 and
 thus
make
 better
 targets
 for
 pre-k
 intervention
 (Bailey,
 Duncan,
 Odgers,
&
 Yu,
 2017).
2.
 Long-term
 pre-k
 effects
State
 investments
 in
 pre-k
 are
 most
 often
 justified
 by
 the
 expec-
tation
 of
 long-term
 effects
 (e.g.,
 Executive
 Office
 of
 the
 President
 of
the
 United
 States,
 2014;
 Heckman,
 2006).
 This
 expectation
 derives
mainly
 from
 longitudinal
 research
 that
 reported
 positive
 outcomes
on
 school
 completion,
 employment,
 marriage
 stability,
 criminal
behavior,
 and
 the
 like
 for
 two
 model
 programs
 –
 Perry
 Preschool,
mounted
 in
 the
 1960s,
 and
 Abecedarian,
 begun
 in
 the
 1970s.
 Both
programs
 served
 a
 small
 number
 of
 children
 in
 a
 single
 location,
 and
neither
 has
 been
 fully
 replicated
 in
 contemporary
 publicly
 funded
programs.
 Indeed,
 the
 political
 feasibility
 of
 implementing
 them
 at
scale
 is
 doubtful.
 These
 programs
 would
 cost
 more
 than
 any
 state
currently
 allocates
 –
 $20,000
 per
 child
 per
 year
 in
 today’s
 dollars
 to
implement
 Perry
 and
 $16,000–$40,000
 for
 Abecedarian
 (Minervino
&
 Pianta,
 2014).
Attempts
 to
 evaluate
 longer-term
 effects
 of
 state-funded
 pre-k
programs
 implemented
 in
 more
 recent
 times
 have
 been
 problem-
atic.
 Random
 assignment
 of
 children
 to
 conditions
 in
 which
 some
attend
 pre-k
 and
 others
 do
 not,
 or
 matching
 on
 relevant
 cogni-
tive,
 family,
 and
 demographic
 baseline
 variables,
 requires
 that
 the
research
 sample
 be
 identified
 prior
 to
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 pre-
k
 year.
 However,
 because
 state
 pre-k
 is
 voluntary,
 there
 are
 few
situations
 in
 which
 families
 intending
 to
 enroll
 their
 children
 can
be
 identified
 in
 advance
 and
 persuaded
 to
 participate
 in
 random
assignment
 or
 provide
 adequate
 baseline
 data
 for
 matching
 those
who
 follow
 through
 with
 enrollment
 and
 those
 who
 do
 not.
As
 a
 result,
 the
 largest
 group
 of
 studies
 of
 longer-term
 state
 pre-k
effects
 compares
 outcomes
 for
 children
 identified
 sometime
 after
the
 pre-k
 year
 who
 did
 and
 did
 not
 attend
 pre-k
 (e.g.,
 Andrews,
Jargowsky,
 &
 Kuhne,
 2012;
 Gormley,
 Phillips,
 &
 Anderson,
 2018;
Huang,
 Invernizzi,
 &
 Drake,
 2012;
 Peisner-Feinberg,
 Mokrova,
 &
Anderson,
 2017).
 These
 post
 hoc
 studies
 lacking
 both
 random
assignment
 and
 true
 baseline
 measures
 collected
 prior
 to
 the
 pre-k
year
 are
 quite
 vulnerable
 to
 selection
 bias
 from
 initial
 differences
 on
unobserved
 variables.
 In
 short,
 why
 did
 some
 parents
 take
 advan-
tage
 of
 a
 voluntary
 pre-k
 program
 while
 others
 did
 not,
 and
 how
 is
that
 related
 to
 family
 and
 child
 characteristics
 that
 might
 influence
later
 outcomes?
 The
 demographic
 variables
 collected
 in
 later
 years
with
 which
 these
 samples
 are
 typically
 matched
 are
 unlikely
 to
 be
sufficient
 to
 account
 for
 all
 the
 relevant
 differences
 between
 chil-
dren
 whose
 parents
 made
 and
 sustained
 the
 effort
 to
 have
 them
attend
 pre-k
 and
 those
 who
 did
 not.
Another
 distinct
 group
 of
 studies
 of
 longer-term
 effects
 of
 state-
funded
 pre-k
 programs
 uses
 difference-in-difference
 (DD)
 methods
that
 examine
 student
 outcomes
 before
 and
 after
 states
 or
 counties
increased
 pre-k
 implementation
 compared
 to
 differences
 over
 the
same
 period
 for
 areas
 with
 no
 analogous
 pre-k
 expansion.
 The
 chal-
lenge
 for
 these
 studies
 is
 to
 isolate
 the
 difference
 made
 by
 variation
in
 pre-k
 implementation
 from
 other
 influential
 factors
 occurring
 in
the
 same
 locations
 over
 the
 same
 period.
 To
 do
 so,
 they
 rely
 on
complex
 statistical
 models,
 but
 those
 do
 not
 always
 yield
 robust
results.
 Fitzpatrick
 (2008),
 for
 example,
 used
 a
 DD
 design
 to
 inves-
tigate
 the
 effects
 of
 the
 Georgia
 universal
 pre-k
 program
 that
 grew
from
 participation
 rates
 of
 14%
 in
 1995
 to
 55%
 in
 2008.
 Some
 analy-
sis
 models
 showed
 positive
 effects
 on
 4th
 grade
 NAEP
 reading
 and
math
 scores
 while
 others
 did
 not.
 Similar
 effects
 that
 were
 gen-
erally
 positive,
 but
 sensitive
 to
 the
 selection
 of
 comparison
 states,
were
 reported
 by
 Cascio
 and
 Schanzenbach
 (2013)
 for
 the
 Georgia
and
 Oklahoma
 programs.
 In
 contrast,
 DD
 analyses
 with
 extensive
data
 on
 the
 More
 at
 Four
 pre-k
 program
 in
 North
 Carolina
 showed
effects
 on
 3rd
 grade
 state
 achievement
 scores
 that
 were
 robust
to
 a
 range
 of
 model
 variations,
 though
 the
 authors
 acknowledged
that
 the
 resulting
 estimates
 were
 too
 large
 to
 plausibly
 represent
direct
 pre-k
 effects
 and
 hypothesized
 that
 there
 must
 be
 spillover
to
 nonparticipating
 children
 (Ladd,
 Muschkin,
 &
 Dodge,
 2014).
The
 overarching
 theme
 in
 research
 on
 long-term
 effects
 of
 state
pre-k
 programs
 is
 one
 of
 methodological
 challenge.
 When
 dealing
with
 a
 voluntary
 program
 with
 children’s
 participation
 always
 a
matter
 of
 self-selection
 by
 parents,
 it
 is
 difficult
 for
 researchers
 to
ensure
 that
 they
 are
 comparing
 outcomes
 for
 pre-k
 participants
and
 nonparticipants
 who
 are
 similar
 in
 all
 ways
 that
 matter
 prior
to
 their
 differential
 pre-k
 experience.
 The
 result
 is
 an
 uneven
 and
inconclusive
 research
 literature.
 As
 the
 experts
 assembled
 by
 the
Brookings
 Institute
 who
 recently
 reviewed
 virtually
 all
 the
 research
on
 the
 effects
 of
 state
 pre-k
 programs
 reported,
 “Convincing
 evi-
dence
 on
 the
 longer-term
 impacts
 of
 scaled-up
 pre-k
 programs
 on
academic
 outcomes
 and
 school
 progress
 is
 sparse,
 precluding
 broad
conclusions”
 (Phillips
 et
 al.,
 2017,
 p.
 9).
In
 this
 context,
 the
 Head
 Start
 Impact
 study
 (Puma,
 Bell,
 Cook,
 &
Heid,
 2010;
 Puma
 et
 al.,
 2012)
 warrants
 attention.
 While
 not
 a
 study
of
 state
 pre-k,
 it
 is
 the
 only
 previous
 randomized
 study
 of
 a
 public
pre-k
 program.
 This
 study
 began
 in
 2002
 with
 a
 national
 sample
 of
5000
 children
 who
 applied
 to
 84
 programs
 expected
 to
 have
 more
applicants
 than
 spaces.
 Children
 were
 randomly
 selected
 for
 offers
of
 admission
 with
 those
 not
 selected
 providing
 the
 control
 group.
The
 4-year-old
 children
 admitted
 to
 Head
 Start
 made
 greater
 gains
across
 the
 pre-k
 year
 than
 nonparticipating
 children
 on
 measures
of
 language
 and
 literacy,
 although
 not
 on
 math.
 However,
 by
 the
end
 of
 kindergarten
 the
 control
 children
 had
 caught
 up
 on
 most
achievement
 outcomes;
 subsequent
 positive
 effects
 for
 Head
 Start
participants
 were
 found
 on
 only
 one
 achievement
 measure
 at
 the
end
 of
 1st
 grade
 and
 another
 at
 the
 end
 of
 3rd
 grade.
 There
 were
no
 statistically
 significant
 effects
 on
 social–emotional
 measures
 at
the
 end
 of
 the
 pre-k
 or
 kindergarten
 years.
 A
 few
 positive
 effects
appeared
 in
 parent
 reports
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 1st
 and
 3rd
 grade
 years,
but
 teacher
 and
 child
 reports
 in
 those
 years
 showed
 either
 null
 or
negative
 effects.
The
 positive
 short-term
 effects
 found
 in
 the
 Head
 Start
 study
 are
consistent
 with
 those
 found
 for
 state
 pre-k
 programs.
 The
 mixed
and
 null
 effects
 found
 thereafter
 in
 this
 methodologically
 strong
study,
 however,
 raise
 questions
 about
 the
 expectation
 of
 substan-
tial
 long-term
 benefits
 that
 has
 largely
 motivated

 Nonetheless,
 the

 is
 only
 one
 ran-

 control
 study
 whereas
 a
 body
 of
 such

 is
 needed
to

 on

 The

a

 Tennessee
 Voluntary
 Pre-k
 Program
In
 1996,
 the
 Tennessee
 legislature
 funded
 10
 pilot
 pre-k
 pro-
grams
 for
 children
 of
 parents
 below
 the
 federal
 poverty
 level
 (TN
Comptroller
 of
 the
 Treasury,
 2009).
 Two
 years
 later,
 the
 program
was
 expanded
 and
 the
 qualifications
 were
 relaxed
 to
 include
 fam-
ilies
 eligible
 for
 the
 federal
 free
 or
 reduced
 price
 lunch
 (FRPL)
programs.
 By
 2008–2009,
 when
 the
 current
 evaluation
 began,
annual
 funding
 had
 reached
 $83
 million,
 supporting
 938
 class-
rooms
 and
 more
 than
 18,000
 children,
 and
 has
 remained
 at
 about
that
 level
 ($87
 million
 in
 2015–2016;
 Parker
 et
 al.,
 2016).
Tennessee
 has
 funded
 its
 pre-k
 program
 as
 a
 separate
 enter-
prise
 housed
 in
 the
 TN
 State
 Department
 of
 Education
 (TNDOE).
Local
 districts
 apply
 for
 funding
 for
 pre-k
 classrooms
 and
 receive
an
 amount
 based
 on
 the
 state’s
 Basic
 Education
 Program
 formula
with
 the
 remaining
 costs
 covered
 by
 local
 funds
 (Tennessee
 Alliance
for
 Early
 Education,
 2008).
 The
 program
 is
 limited
 to
 4-year-old
children
 eligible
 for
 kindergarten
 the
 following
 year
 with
 families
qualifying
 for
 FRPL
 the
 top
 priority.
 A
 minimum
 instructional
 time
of
 5½
 hours
 per
 day
 5
 days
 a
 week
 must
 be
 provided
 in
 classes
of
 no
 more
 than
 20
 students
 by
 a
 state-licensed
 teacher
 endorsed
for
 early
 childhood
 education
 and
 paid
 on
 the
 same
 scale
 as
 K-12
teachers.
 A
 CDA
 or
 early
 childhood
 associate
 degree
 is
 preferred
 for
educational
 assistants
 assigned
 to
 each
 classroom,
 but
 not
 required
(TNDOE,
 2013).
 The
 program
 must
 use
 an
 approved
 curriculum
from
 a
 list
 provided
 by
 TNDOE
 (TNDOE
 Office
 of
 Early
 Learning,
2014).
TNDOE
 attempted
 to
 follow
 the
 few
 guidelines
 available
 for
 a
quality
 pre-k
 program,
 particularly
 those
 from
 the
 National
 Insti-
tute
 of
 Early
 Education
 Research
 (NIEER,
 nd).
 Requirements
 for
programs
 are
 laid
 out
 in
 the
 Scope
 of
 Services
 (TNDOE,
 2013)
 and
meet
 9
 of
 the
 10
 standards
 advocated
 by
 NIEER.
 Districts
 are
given
 latitude
 within
 the
 parameters
 of
 those
 requirements,
 how-
ever,
 and
 there
 is
 considerable
 diversity
 in
 local
 implementations.
In
 this
 regard,
 the
 Tennessee
 Voluntary
 Pre-K
 Program
 (VPK)
 is
not
 atypical
 of
 state
 pre-k
 programs
 generally,
 operating
 with
some
 mandated
 structure
 based
 on
 accepted
 standards,
 but
 nei-
ther
 tightly
 controlled
 nor
 shaped
 and
 guided
 by
 an
 overarching
vision
 widely
 understood
 and
 embraced
 throughout
 the
 state.
 The
research
 on
 its
 effectiveness
 reported
 here
 should
 inform
 policy
makers
 in
 states
 with
 similar
 programs,
 and
 has
 already
 done
 so
 for
Tennessee
 policy
 makers.
 The
 guiding
 questions
 for
 this
 research
are
 as
 follows.
1.
 Does
 participation
 in
 VPK
 improve
 early
 literacy,
 language,
 and
math
 skills,
 and
 classroom
 behavior
 by
 kindergarten
 entry
 the
following
 year
 (immediate
 effects)?
2.
 Does
 participation
 in
 VPK
 provide
 advantages
 that
 carry
 for-
ward
 to
 enhance
 academic
 performance
 in
 later
 grades
 by
improving
 achievement
 and
 reducing
 grade
 retention,
 absen-
teeism,
 disciplinary
 infractions,
 and
 special
 education
 placement
(longer-term
 effects)?
3.
 Are
 there
 demographic
 subgroups
 of
 children
 who
 benefit
 more
from
 participation
 in
 VPK?
4.
 Method
This
 study
 is
 part
 of
 a
 larger
 VPK
 evaluation
 with
 two
 major
 com-
ponents:
 a
 randomized
 control
 trial
 (RCT)
 implemented
 in
 selected
oversubscribed
 sites,
 and
 an
 age-cutoff
 RDD
 applied
 to
 a
 probability
sample
 of
 VPK
 classrooms
 across
 Tennessee.
 The
 RDD
 component
was
 designed
 to
 assess
 variation
 in
 classroom
 characteristics
 and
achievement
 gains;
 those
 results
 will
 be
 reported
 separately
 and
are
 not
 discussed
 here.
 However,
 because
 the
 RDD
 was
 based
 on
a
 statewide
 probability
 sample,
 those
 data
 were
 used
 to
 create
weighting
 functions
 for
 statistical
 analysis
 to
 adjust
 the
 RCT
 effect
estimates
 to
 represent
 those
 expected
 if
 they
 were
 generalized
 to
the
 statewide
 population
 of
 participating
 programs
 and
 children.
The
 RCT
 reported
 here
 was
 designed
 to
 evaluate
 the
 effects
 of
VPK
 participation
 on
 a
 range
 of
 educationally
 relevant
 outcomes
through
 3rd
 grade.
 The
 full
 randomized
 sample
 of
 participants
 in
the
 RCT
 includes
 children
 randomly
 assigned
 to
 receive
 an
 offer
 of
admission
 to
 VPK
 or
 not.
 These
 children
 have
 been
 followed
 in
 the
state
 education
 database
 with
 attention
 to
 attendance,
 retention
in
 grade,
 special
 education
 designations,
 disciplinary
 actions,
 and
state
 achievement
 test
 scores.
 However,
 state
 data
 provide
 a
 limited
picture
 of
 children’s
 academic
 performance
 and
 classroom
 behav-
ior
 during
 the
 years
 prior
 to
 3rd
 grade
 when
 state
 achievement
tests
 are
 first
 administered.
 The
 state
 data
 were
 therefore
 supple-
mented
 with
 data
 collected
 by
 the
 research
 team
 from
 a
 subset
of
 children
 in
 the
 full
 sample
 with
 parental
 consent.
 These
 children
constitute
 the
 intensive
 substudy
 sample
 and
 the
 data
 they
 provided
allow
 the
 immediate
 effects
 of
 VPK
 to
 be
 assessed.
 Prior
 reports
have
 described
 the
 components
 of
 the
 overall
 study
 and
 presented
findings
 from
 earlier
 stages
 of
 the
 project
 (Lipsey,
 Farran,
 Bilbrey,
Hofer,
 &
 Dong,
 2011;
 Lipsey,
 Hofer,
 Dong,
 Farran,
 &
 Bilbrey,
 2013).
4.1.
 Full
 randomized
 sample
In
 school
 year
 2008–2009,
 when
 this
 study
 began,
 VPK
 had
capacity
 for
 only
 42%
 of
 the
 eligible
 children
 in
 Tennessee
 (Grehan
et
 al.,
 2011)
 and
 many
 programs
 received
 more
 applicants
 than
 they
could
 accommodate
 with
 some
 children
 necessarily
 denied
 admis-
sion.
 Prior
 to
 school
 years
 2009–2010
 and
 2010–2011,
 personnel
 in
the
 TN
 Office
 of
 Early
 Learning
 (OEL)
 surveyed
 programs
 about
 the
spaces
 available
 in
 their
 classrooms
 and
 the
 number
 of
 applications
they
 had
 already
 received.
 Based
 on
 that
 information
 and
 the
 expe-
rience
 of
 the
 OEL
 Director
 with
 VPK
 application
 trends,
 programs
likely
 to
 be
 oversubscribed
 were
 identified,
 informed
 by
 OEL
 that
they
 were
 eligible
 for
 the
 randomization,
 and
 asked
 if
 they
 would
participate
 in
 the
 study.
Most
 of
 those
 programs
 agreed
 to
 participate
 and
 sent
 their
applicant
 lists
 to
 the
 research
 team
 to
 be
 sorted
 into
 random
 order
and
 returned.
 Program
 staff
 were
 asked
 to
 fill
 their
 pre-k
 seats
 in
the
 order
 that
 children
 appeared
 on
 these
 randomized
 lists.
 The
procedure
 was
 refined
 for
 the
 second
 cohort
 to
 ask
 program
 staff
to
 attempt
 to
 contact
 a
 parent
 at
 least
 three
 times
 on
 different
 days
and
 times
 to
 offer
 admission.
 Only
 if
 they
 were
 unable
 to
 contact
 a
parent
 after
 these
 attempts
 or
 the
 parent
 declined
 the
 offer,
 were
they
 to
 go
 to
 the
 next
 child
 on
 the
 list
 whose
 parents
 had
 not
 yet
been
 contacted.
 Once
 the
 slots
 in
 a
 given
 program
 were
 filled,
 the
remaining
 children
 became
 a
 waiting
 list.
 If
 a
 child
 offered
 admis-
sion
 did
 not
 show
 up
 for
 the
 program
 when
 school
 started,
 the
 next
child
 on
 the
 waiting
 list
 was
 offered
 that
 place.
 Any
 children
 not
offered
 admission
 after
 that
 point
 became
 eligible
 for
 the
 control
group
 of
 VPK
 nonparticipants.
Across
 two
 cohorts
 (school
 years
 2009–2010
 and
 2010–2011)
this
 procedure
 generated
 150
 randomized
 applicant
 lists
 (R-Lists),
not
 all
 of
 which
 were
 active
 for
 the
 purposes
 of
 the
 study.
 Active
R-Lists
 involved
 full
 VPK
 classrooms
 (not
 blended
 with
 children
supported
 by
 other
 sources),
 were
 actually
 used
 to
 sequence
 admis-
sion
 offers,
 and
 included
 at
 least
 one
 VPK
 eligible
 child
 who
attended
 a
 VPK
 classroom
 in
 the
 R-List
 program
 or
 another
 VPK
program
 and
 at
 least
 one
 eligible
 child
 who
 did
 not
 attend
 any
VPK
 classroom.

 criteria
 identified

4.2.
 Representativeness
 of
 the
 RCT
 sample
More
 than
 600
 programs
 were
 funded
 in
 each
 of
 the
 years
 for
which
 the
 79
 participating
 programs
 contributed
 active
 R-Lists
to
 the
 RCT.
 A
 natural
 question
 is
 how
 representative
 that
 rela-
tively
 small
 group
 of
 oversubscribed
 programs
 is
 of
 VPK
 programs
statewide.
 Geographically,
 they
 were
 widely
 distributed
 across
Tennessee
 with
 a
 mix
 of
 urban,
 suburban,
 and
 rural
 locations.
 A
more
 specific
 picture
 was
 obtained
 by
 comparing
 their
 charac-
teristics
 with
 those
 of
 the
 full
 population
 of
 VPK
 programs.
 The
characteristics
 OEL
 staff
 identified
 as
 most
 relevant
 for
 describing
differences
 among
 the
 TN
 programs
 were
 (a)
 region
 of
 the
 state,
(b)
 urban
 vs.
 nonurban
 location,
 (c)
 in
 a
 school
 vs.
 a
 partner
 com-
munity
 agency,
 (d)
 an
 original

 program
 vs.
 one

VPK
 went
 to
 scale,
 and
 (e)
 whether
 located
 in
 or
 associated
 with
 a
high
 priority
 school
 (designated
 as
 among
 the
 lowest
 performing
in
 the
 state).
 OEL
 provided
 descriptive
 data
 on
 those
 characteristics
for
 the
 646
 programs
 funded
 in
 2009–2010.
 Table

 the
programs
 in

 the
 children
 in
 that
 RDD
 sample
 included
demographic
 characteristics
 that
 can
 be
 compared
 to
 those
 of
 the
children
 in
 the
 RCT
 sample.
 As
 the
 first
 two
 panels
 of
 Table
 2
show,
 there
 are
 children
 in
 the
 RCT
 sample
 from
 all
 the
 demo-
graphic
 groups
 found
 in
 the
 statewide
 population,
 and
 with
 similar
proportions
 on
 several,
 but
 not
 all,
 characteristics.
 The
 largest
 dis-
crepancies
 are
 an
 under-representation
 of
 White
 children
 in
 the
RCT
 sample,
 an
 overrepresentation
 of
 Hispanic
 children,
 and
 relat-
edly,
 of
 non-native
 English
 speaking
 children.
In
 order
 to
 extrapolate
 results
 of
 statistical
 analyses
 with
 data
from
 the
 RCT
 sample
 to
 estimate
 the
 analogous
 results
 for
 the
statewide
 population
 of
 VPK
 children,
 the
 comparative
 data
 in
Table
 2
 were
 used
 to
 create
 a
 weighting
 function
 for
 application
in
 those
 analyses.
 The
 child
 characteristics
 in
 Table
 2
 were
 used
in
 a
 logistic
 regression
 to
 predict
 membership
 in
 the
 RCT
 sample
vs.
 the
 statewide
 probability
 sample.
 The
 predicted
 values
 for
 chil-
dren
 in
 the
 RCT
 were
 thus
 a
 kind
 of
 propensity
 score
 for
 how
 similar
their
 characteristics
 were
 to
 those
 of
 the
 children
 in
 the
 population
sample.
 The
 RCT
 and
 population
 samples
 were
 then
 stratified
 into
bands
 with
 similar
 propensity
 scores
 and
 weights
 were
 assigned
to
 the
 children
 in
 the
 RCT
 to
 adjust
 their
 proportion
 in
 each
 strata
to
 match
 the
 proportion
 of
 children
 from
 the
 population
 in
 that
strata.
 The
 third
 column
 of
 the
 section
 on
 the
 RCT
 sample
 in
 Table
 2
shows
 that
 applying
 that
 weighting
 function
 creates
 a
 close
 match
between
 the
 demographics
 characteristics
 of
 the
 RCT
 sample
 and
those
 of
 the
 children
 in
 the
 statewide
 population.
 This
 weighting
function
 is
 used
 in
 analyses
 reported
 later
 to
 estimate
 how
 effects
found
 in
 the
 RCT
 sample
 are
 expected
 to
 look
 when
 generalized
 to
the
 statewide
 population
 of
 VPK
 participants.
4.3.
 Treatment
 and
 control
 groups
 in
 the
 RCT
 sample
The
 R-List
 randomization
 of
 the
 2990
 children
 in
 the
 RCT
analytic
 sample
 designated
 1852
 children
 to
 receive
 offers
 of
admission,
 leaving
 1138
 who
 were
 not
 to
 receive
 such
 offers.
 These
two
 groups
 constitute
 the
 intent-to-treat
 (ITT)
 treatment
 and
 con-
trol
 groups
 for
 the
 RCT.
 Identification
 of
 actual
 participation
 in
 VPK
irrespective
 of
 the
 R-List
 assignment
 was
 determined
 from
 the
 state
database
 for
 attendance
 during
 the
 respective
 pre-k
 years
 for
 each
cohort.
 Of
 the
 2990
 children,
 1997
 attended
 VPK
 for
 at
 least
 one
day
 (mean
 of
 144
 days);
 the
 remaining
 993
 children
 did
 not.
 These
two
 groups
 constitute
 the
 treatment-on-treated
 (TOT)
 treatment
and
 control
 groups
 respectively.

 these

 groups.

and
 obtaining
 responses
 from
 parents
 proved
 challenging.
 For
 the
2009–2010
 cohort,
 TNDOE
 officials
 interpreted
 the
 confidentiality
requirements
 for
 FRPL
 eligible
 children
 in
 a
 way
 that
 only
 allowed
parents
 to
 be
 contacted
 via
 a
 mailing
 sent
 centrally
 from
 TNDOE.
While
 virtually
 all
 the
 parents
 who
 responded
 consented,
 most
did
 not
 respond.
 Of
 the
 1824
 children
 in
 that
 cohort,
 affirmative
parental
 consent
 forms
 were
 received
 for
 only
 24.4%.
For
 the
 2010–2011
 cohort,
 arrangements
 were
 negotiated
 to
allow
 parents
 to
 be
 approached
 about
 consent
 as
 an
 adjunct
 to
the
 VPK
 application
 process.
 Participating
 programs
 included
 con-
sent
 forms
 with
 the
 application
 paperwork
 during
 the
 registration
period,
 and
 a
 member
 of
 the
 research
 team
 was
 available
 to
 respond
to
 any
 questions
 that
 arose.
 This
 procedure
 not
 only
 facilitated
 the
consent
 process
 but
 had
 the
 advantage
 of
 requesting
 parental
 con-
sent
 prior
 to
 randomization
 so
 parents
 did
 not
 yet
 know
 if
 their
children
 would
 be
 offered
 admission.
 Of
 the
 initial
 1307
 children
in
 that
 cohort,
 affirmative
 consents
 were
 received
 for
 67.8%.
 Again,
most
 of
 the
 remainder
 simply
 did
 not
 respond;
 very
 few
 actively
declined
 to
 consent.
These
 procedures
 yielded
 1331
 consented
 children,
 not
 all
 of
whom
 were
 eligible
 for
 the
 intensive
 substudy
 sample.
 As
 with
the
 full
 RCT
 sample,
 this
 subsample
 was
 restricted
 to
 children
 age-
eligible
 for
 kindergarten
 the
 next
 year,
 income-eligible
 for
 FRPL,
 not
in
 a
 blended
 classroom,
 and
 who
 had
 not
 applied
 only
 to
 receive
out-of-classroom
 special
 education
 services.
 The
 sample
 was
 fur-
ther
 restricted
 to
 children
 on
 R-Lists
 with
 consented
 children
 in
both
 the
 treatment
 and
 control
 groups
 and
 who
 had
 at
 least
 one
posttest
 measure
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 pre-k
 year.
 These
 restrictions
left
 an
 analytic
 sample
 (hereafter
 the
 Intensive
 SubStudy
 subsam-
ple;
 i.e.,
 ISS
 subsample)  of
 1076
 children
 on
 76
 R-Lists
 from
 58
 VPK
programs
 in
 21
 school
 districts
 across
 the
 state.
 Those
 76
 R-Lists
included
 2086
 eligible
 children
 with
 the
 1076
 in
 the
 ISS
 subsam-
ple
 thus
 representing
 a
 51.6%
 participation
 rate
 from
 those
 R-Lists.

4.5.
 Representativeness
 of
 the
 ISS
 subsample
The
 ISS
 subsample
 is
 a
 subset
 of
 the
 RCT
 sample
 except
 for
 the
11
 children
 with
 parental
 consent
 for
 data
 collection
 while
 home-
schooled
 or
 enrolled
 in
 private
 school,
 but
 with
 no
 data
 past
 the
pre-k
 year
 in
 the
 state
 database.
 Relevant
 questions
 are
 how
 sim-
ilar
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 is
 to
 the
 full
 RCT
 sample
 and,
 especially,
how
 similar
 it
 is
 to
 the
 statewide
 VPK
 population.
 The
 third
 pan-
els
 of
 Tables
 1
 and
 2
 address
 these
 questions
 and
 show
 that
 the
characteristics
 of
 the
 programs
 and
 children
 contributing
 to
 the
 ISS
subsample
 are
 substantially
 similar
 to
 those
 of
 the
 RCT
 sample
 and
the
 statewide
 population.
While
 Table

 the
 ISS
 subsample
 to
 VPK

statewide
 on
 demographic
 characteristics,
 a
 more
 detailed
 com-
parison
 is
 possible
 for
 that
 subsample.
 The
 data
 collected
 on
 the
statewide
 RDD
 sample
 included
 assessments
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
the
 pre-k
 year
 on
 the
 same

ment
 measures
 administered
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 pre-k
 year
 to
the
 ISS
 subsample
 (described
 in
 more
 detail
 later).
 Table
 3
 shows
that
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 has
 baseline
 WJ
 achievement
 scores
 sim-
ilar
 to
 those
 of
 the
 statewide
 sample.
 To
 allow
 a
 closer
 match,
 a
weighting
 function
 was
 created
 for
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 using
 the
 pro-
cedure
 described
 above
 for
 the
 RCT
 sample.
 The
 results
 of
 applying
that
 weighting
 function
 to
 the
 baseline
 characteristics
 of
 the
 chil-
dren
 in
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 are
 shown
 in
 the
 far
 right
 columns
 of
Tables
 2
 and
 3.
 That
 weighting
 function
 was
 also
 applied
 in
 anal-
yses
 reported
 later
 to
 extrapolate
 findings
 from
 the
 ISS
 subsample
to
 the
 statewide
 population.
4.6.
 Treatment
 and
 control
 groups
 in
 the
 ISS
 subsample
Of
 the
 1076
 children
 in
 the
 ISS
 subsample,
 the
 R-Lists
 designated
697
 to
 receive
 offers
 of
 VPK
 admission
 while
 the
 remaining
 379
were
 not
 to
 receive
 offers.
 These
 groups
 thus
 constitute
 the
 intent-
to-treat
 (ITT)
 treatment
 and
 control
 groups
 for
 analysis
 with
 the
 ISS
subsample.
 According
 to
 records
 in
 the
 state
 database,
 780
 of
 the
1076
 children
 attended
 VPK
 for
 at
 least
 one
 day
 (mean
 146
 days)

 for
 the
 remaining

from
 the
 state
 database.
 In
 addition,
 the
 children
 in
 that
 subsample
were
 individually
 assessed
 by
 research
 staff
 in
 the
 fall
 and
 spring
of
 their
 pre-k
 year
 (including
 the
 11
 children
 home
 schooled
 or
attending
 private
 schools).
 VPK
 participants
 were
 assessed
 at
 their
program
 sites
 and
 nonparticipants
 were
 assessed
 at
 locations
 con-
venient
 for
 the
 parents
 (e.g.,
 Head
 Start
 centers,
 libraries,
 parks,
and
 homes).
 Children
 in
 both
 groups
 were
 assessed
 in
 the
 spring
of
 each
 subsequent
 year
 through
 the
 3rd
 grade
 year.
 Assessments
were
 completed
 on
 100%
 of
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
pre-k
 year,
 97.2%
 at
 end
 of
 kindergarten,
 95.6%
 at
 end
 of
 1st,
 94.4%
at
 end
 of
 2nd,
 and
 92.3%
 at
 end
 of
 3rd.
Early
 in
 the
 kindergarten
 year
 and
 in
 the
 spring
 of
 the
 1st
through
 3rd
 grade
 years,
 children’s
 classroom
 behaviors
 were
 rated
by
 their
 teachers.
 Ratings
 by
 kindergarten
 teachers
 near
 the
 begin-
ning
 of
 the
 kindergarten
 year
 were
 treated
 as
 pre-k
 outcomes.
 The
target
 time
 for
 those
 ratings
 was
 6
 weeks
 (42
 days)
 into
 the
 kinder-
garten
 year
 –
 long
 enough
 for
 teachers
 to
 become
 familiar
 with
the
 children
 but
 before
 extensive
 exposure
 to
 kindergarten
 instruc-
tion.
 Not
 all
 teachers
 were
 responsive
 to
 that
 request
 –
 on
 average,
ratings
 were
 received
 52
 days
 into
 the
 kindergarten
 year
 for
 VPK
participants
 and
 51
 days
 for
 control
 children
 (standard
 deviation
of
 41
 days).
 The
 completion
 rates
 for
 teacher
 ratings
 ranged
 from
89.5%
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 kindergarten
 to
 86.7%
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
3rd
 grade
 year.

 Measures
 for
 the
 intensive
 substudy
 (ISS)
 subsample
4.8.1.
 Parent
 questionnaire
During
 the
 pre-k
 year,
 parents
 of
 consented
 children
 were
 inter-
viewed
 via
 telephone
 about
 their
 education
 and
 employment
 and
that
 of
 their
 spouse/partner,
 the
 home
 language
 and
 literacy
 envi-
ronment,
 and
 childcare
 arrangements
 if
 their
 child
 was
 not
 in
VPK.
 When
 needed,
 these
 interviews
 were
 conducted
 by
 Spanish-
speaking
 interviewers.
4.8.2.
 Direct
 assessments
Children’s
 academic
 achievement
 was
 assessed
 with
 a
 selection
of
 scales
 from
 the
 Woodcock–Johnson
 (WJ)
 III
 Achievement
 Battery
(Woodcock,
 McGrew,
 &
 Mather,
 2001)
 administered
 in
 English.
 At
the
 beginning
 and
 end
 of
 the
 pre-k
 year,
 these
 included
 two
 mea-
sures
 of
 literacy
 skills
 (Letter–Word
 Identification
 and
 Spelling),
two
 measures
 of
 language
 skills
 (Oral
 Comprehension
 and
 Picture
Vocabulary),
 and
 two
 measures
 of
 math
 skills
 (Applied
 Problems
and
 Quantitative
 Concepts).
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 kindergarten
 year
and
 through
 the
 3rd
 grade
 year
 two
 other
 scales
 were
 added:
 a
reading
 measure
 (Passage
 Comprehension)
 and
 another
 math
 mea-
sure
 (Calculation).
 Analysis
 was
 conducted
 with
 the
 longitudinally
scaled
 W-scores
 from
 these
 measures,
 which
 are
 comparable
 from
year
 to
 year
 in
 ways
 that
 index
 the
 change
 that
 has
 taken
 place
 over
successive
 waves
 of
 measurement.
 The
 scores
 on
 these
 different
 WJ
scales
 were
 moderately
 to
 highly
 intercorrelated.
 To
 provide
 sum-
mary
 achievement
 indices,
 composite
 scores
 were
 created
 as
 the
mean
 of
 the
 W-scores
 across
 the
 individual
 scales,
 one
 that
 com-
bined
 the
 original
 six
 scales
 administered
 from
 the
 beginning
 of
pre-k
 (WJ
 Composite
 6)
 and
 another
 that
 combined
 those
 six
 sub-
scales
 with
 the
 two
 first
 administered
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 kindergarten
year
 (WJ
 Composite
 8).
4.8.3.
 Teacher
 ratings
Two
 teacher
 rating
 instruments
 were
 completed
 by
 kinder-
garten,
 1st,
 2nd,
 and
 3rd
 grade
 teachers.
 The
 Cooper–Farran
Behavioral
 Rating
 Scales
 (Cooper
 &
 Farran,
 1991)
 ask
 teachers
to
 rate
 each
 child’s
 work-related
 and
 interpersonal
 skills.
 Work-
Related
 Skills
 assesses
 ability
 to
 work
 independently,
 listen
 to
 the
teacher,
 remember
 and
 comply
 with
 instructions,
 complete
 tasks,
and
 otherwise
 engage
 appropriately
 in
 classroom
 activities.
 This
scale
 consists
 of
 16
 7-point
 behaviorally
 anchored
 ratings
 with
 the
mean
 as
 an
 overall
 total
 score
 (Cronbach
 alpha
 reliability
 coeffi-
cients
 ranged
 from
 .94
 to
 .95
 across
 the
 waves
 of
 data
 collection).
Interpersonal
 Skills
 assesses
 social
 interactions
 with
 peers
 including
behavior
 in
 group
 activities,
 play,
 and
 outdoor
 games;
 expression
of
 feelings
 and
 ideas;
 and
 response
 to
 others’
 mistakes
 or
 misfor-
tunes.
 It
 consists
 of
 21
 7-point
 behaviorally
 anchored
 ratings
 with
the
 mean
 providing
 an
 overall
 total
 score
 (Cronbach
 alphas
 from
.93
 to
 .94
 across
 waves).
The
 second
 measure,
 the
 Academic
 Classroom
 and
 Behavior
Record
 (ACBR;
 Farran,
 Bilbrey,
 &
 Lipsey,
 2003),
 consists
 of
 four
scales.
 Preparedness

 Peer

 includes
 two
 7-point
 behaviorally
anchored
 ratings
 for
 whether
 other
 children
 like
 the
 child
 and
 how
many
 close
 friends
 the
 child
 has;
 the
 mean
 is
 the
 total
 score
 (Cron-
bach
 alphas
 of
 .75
 to

 across

 Behavior
 Problems
 asks
whether
 a
 child
 has
 shown
 any
 of
 nine
 problem
 behaviors
 includ-
ing
 explosive
 or
 overactive
 behavior,
 attention
 problems,
 physical
or
 relational
 aggression,
 and
 social
 withdrawal
 or
 anxiety.
 A
 total
score
 is
 computed
 as
 0
 or
 1
 to
 indicate
 whether
 no
 problems
are
 identified
 vs.
 one
 or
 more
 (Cronbach
 alphas
 of
 .63–.70
 across
waves).
 Feelings
 About
 School
 consists
 of
 six
 3-point
 ratings
 for
 the
child’s
 liking
 or
 disliking
 school,
 enjoying
 and
 engaging
 in
 class-
room
 activities,
 and
 seeming
 happy
 at
 school.
 Ratings
 are
 skewed
toward
 positive
 responses
 so
 the
 total
 score
 is
 computed
 as
 the
mean
 with
 the
 lowest
 rating
 on
 any
 item
 scored
 1
 and
 either
 of
 the
higher
 ratings
 scored
 2
 (Cronbach
 alphas
 of
 .80–.85
 across
 waves).
4.9.
 Analysis
4.9.1.
 Missing
 data
Missing
 value
 rates
 for
 the
 RCT
 sample
 ranged
 from
 0%
 to
 6.3%
except
 for
 3rd
 grade
 state
 achievement
 scores
 with
 18.4%
 miss-
ing,
 mostly
 due
 to
 children
 retained
 who
 had
 not
 yet
 reached
 3rd
grade.
 Missing
 values
 for
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 ranged
 from
 0%
 to
 5.6%
for
 parent
 interview
 and
 child
 assessment
 data
 and
 from
 10.5%
 to
13.3%
 for
 teacher
 ratings.
 To
 retain
 the
 full
 samples
 in
 all
 analyses
given
 these
 modest
 missing
 data
 rates,
 multiple
 imputation
 was
done
 separately
 in
 the
 RCT
 and
 ISS
 samples
 and,
 in
 each,
 sepa-
rately
 for
 VPK
 participants
 and
 nonparticipants
 using
 the
 Mistler
(2013)
 procedure
 for
 multilevel
 data
 (children
 nested
 in
 R-Lists).
Fifty
 imputed
 files
 were
 produced
 with
 the
 results
 of
 analysis
 of
each
 pooled
 to
 include
 the
 uncertainty
 associated
 with
 the
 imputa-
tions
 in
 the
 standard
 error
 estimates.
 Analyses
 using
 only
 observed
outcome
 data
 were
 conducted
 in
 parallel
 to
 identify
 any
 sensitivity
to
 the
 imputations
 in
 the
 statistical
 conclusions.
4.9.2.
 Analysis
 models
All
 analyses
 used
 hierarchical
 linear
 models
 with
 children
nested
 in
 R-Lists
 that
 were
 nested
 in
 school
 districts.
 The
 primary
analyses
 were
 intent-to-treat
 (ITT)
 comparisons
 with
 outcomes
for
 children
 randomly
 assigned
 to
 receive
 an
 offer
 of
 VPK
 admis-
sion
 compared
 with
 outcomes
 for
 children
 assigned
 to
 receive
 no
offer.
 A
 standard
 set
 of
 covariates
 (described
 later)
 was
 included
in
 each
 analysis
 to
 adjust
 for
 baseline
 differences,
 improve
 statisti-
cal
 power,
 and
 provide
 a
 basis
 for
 moderator
 analysis.
 The
 results
of
 each
 ITT
 analysis
 were
 then
 used
 to
 estimate
 treatment-on-the
treated
 (TOT)
 effects
 for
 children
 who
 actually
 attended
 VPK
 com-
pared
 to
 children
 who
 did
 not
 attend.
 The
 TOT
 estimates
 were
generated
 from
 two-stage
 least-squares
 (2SLS)
 regressions
 with
R-List
 random
 assignment
 as
 an
 instrumental
 variable
 (Angrist,
Imbens,
 &
 Rubin,
 1996;
 Angrist,
 2006).
Overall,
 79%
 of
 the
 RCT
 sample
 and
 84%
 of
 the
 ISS
 subsample
complied
 with
 the
 random
 assignment.
 The
 2SLS
 estimates
 for
 TOT
effects
 were
 obtained
 by
 rescaling
 the
 ITT
 effect
 estimates
 with
a
 multiplier
 based
 on
 the
 proportion
 (ptp)
 of
 children
 assigned
 to
VPK
 who
 actually
 participated
 (treatment
 compliers)
 and
 the
 pro-
portion
 (pcp)
 assigned
 to
 the
 control
 condition
 who
 nonetheless
also
 participated
 (crossovers)
 that
 is
 defined
 as
 the
 inverse
 of
 the
ptp −
 pcp difference
 (reported
 in
 Table
 4
 for
 the
 RCT
 and
 ISS
 sam-
ples).
 The
 rationale
 for
 this
 approach
 to
 estimating
 TOT
 effects
 can
be
 found
 in
 Puma
 et
 al.
 (2010,
 pp.
 5–34
 to
 5–53)
 and
 Gennetian,
Morris,
 Bos,
 and
 Bloom
 (2005).
 A
 notable
 feature
 of
 this
 procedure
is
 that
 it
 rescales
 the
 standard
 errors
 of
 the
 ITT
 estimates
 with
 the
same
 multiplier
 so
 that
 the
 statistical
 significance
 of
 the
 TOT
 effect
estimates
 is
 the
 same
 as
 that
 for
 the
 ITT
 estimates.
4.9.3.
 Baseline
 equivalence
 for
 the
 RCT
 sample
Baseline
 variables
 for
 the
 RCT
 are
 limited
 to
 the
 few
 static
 demo-
graphics
 available
 in
 the
 state
 database:
 age,
 gender,
 race/ethnicity,
and
 native
 language.
 Table
 5
 shows
 the
 differences
 between
 the
 ITT
treatment
 and
 control
 groups
 on
 these
 variables.
 The
 differences
were
 tested
 in
 multilevel
 OLS
 regression
 models
 with
 ITT
 condi-
tion
 as
 the
 only
 predictor
 and
 none
 was
 statistically
 significant.
For
 binary
 variables,
 more
 technically
 appropriate
 logistic
 regres-
sion
 analyses
 were
 also
 conducted
 to
 check
 that
 the
 results
 were
similar
 (Cleary
 &
 Angel,
 1984),
 and
 those
 also
 showed
 no
 signifi-
cant
 differences.
 There
 were
 no
 missing
 values
 on
 these
 variables
and
 all
 but
 the
 language
 differentiation
 for
 Hispanic
 children
 were
included
 as
 covariates
 in
 the
 outcome
 analyses
 for
 the
 RCT
 reported
later.
Further
 analysis
 explored
 the
 baseline
 equivalence
 on
 these
variables
 for
 each
 of
 the
 two
 cohorts
 of
 children
 combined
 in
 the
full
 RCT
 sample.
 The
 analyses
 reported
 in
 Table
 5
 were
 repeated
with
 addition
 of
 dummy
 codes
 for
 cohort
 and
 cohort
 by
 treat-
ment
 condition
 interaction
 terms
 that
 tested
 for
 cohort
 differences
on
 the
 treatment-control
 equivalence
 of
 the
 baseline
 variables.
Neither
 the
 cohort
 main
 effect
 nor
 the
 interaction
 was
 statisti-
cally
 significant
 for
 any
 baseline
 variable.
 Additionally,
 all
 analyses
of
 VPK
 effects
 for
 the
 RCT
 sample
 reported
 later
 were
 repeated
with
 cohort
 and
 cohort
 by
 treatment
 condition
 interaction
 terms
added.
 With
 only
 a
 few
 scattered
 exceptions,
 these
 interaction
 tests
showed
 no
 statistically
 significant
 differential
 treatment
 effects
 for
the
 cohorts
 so
 VPK
 effect
 estimates
 are
 not
 reported
 separately
 by
cohort.
Because
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 is
 the
 consented
 subset
 of
 the
 RCT
sample
 (except
 for
 11
 children),
 the
 similarity
 of
 the
 ISS
 subsample
to
 the
 remaining
 children
 not
 in
 that
 subsample
 on
 the
 RCT
 baseline
variables
 can
 also
 be
 examined.
 Each
 analysis
 reported
 in
 Table
 5
was
 repeated
 with
 addition
 of
 a
 dummy
 code
 for
 ISS
 member-
ship
 and
 its
 interaction
 with
 the
 ITT
 treatment
 condition.
 Neither
the
 main
 effect
 for
 ISS
 subsample
 membership
 nor
 the
 interaction
was
 statistically
 significant
 at
 p
 <
 .05
 for
 any
 baseline
 variable.
 Two
effects
 were
 significant
 at
 the
 p
 <
 .10
 level,
 one
 indicating
 that
 the
proportion
 of
 White
 children
 in
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 was
 somewhat
larger
 than
 the
 proportion
 among
 those
 not
 in
 that
 subsample
 (by
about
 five
 percentage
 points),

 with
 the
 reverse

 for

 (three

ences
 in
 each

 Within
 each
 subgroup,
 however,
 the

 were
 not

Overall,
 these
 results
 show
 substantial
 similarity
 between

 not

 but
 also
 raise
the
 possibility
 of
 differential
 effects
 for
 these
 groups
 on
 the
 out-
comes
 examined
 later.
 Accordingly,
 all
 analyses
 of
 VPK
 effects
 with

 were
 repeated
 with
 a
 test
 of
 the

 only
 a
 few
 statistically
 significant
 differential
 VPK

between
 the

 and
 the
 remaining
 portion
 of
 the
 RCT
sample.
 This
 finding
 has
 important
 implications.
 In
 particular,
 it
indicates
 that
 VPK
 effects
 that
 can
 only
 be
 examined
 with
 the
 ISS
subsample
 can
 be
 expected
 to
 generalize
 reasonably
 well
 to
 the
 full

 compares
the

 in
 the

 on
 a
 dif-
ferentiated
 set
 of
 demographic
 variables,
 the
 WJ
 pretests,
 and
 key
variables
 from
 the
 parent
 interviews.
 Multilevel

 confirmed
the
 substantial
 similarity
 of
 the
 groups
 on
 all

 two
 of
 these
 vari-
ables
 and,
 except
 for
 those,
 it
 is
 notable
 that
 the
 effect

 for
 the

 are
 modest,

 Rubin

 too
 large

The
 most
 striking
 exception
 to
 the
 similarity
 of
 the

 relates
 to
 the

 Results
The
 research
 questions
 that
 guided
 this
 study
 asked
 about
 the
effects
 of
 VPK
 on
 children’s
 cognitive
 skills
 and
 classroom
 behav-
ior
 by
 kindergarten
 entry,
 whether
 VPK
 effects
 carry
 forward
 to
enhance
 performance
 in
 later
 grades,
 and
 whether
 the
 effects
 are
greater
 for
 some
 demographic
 subgroups
 of
 children
 than
 others.
The
 findings
 presented
 in
 this
 results
 section
 address
 each
 of
 these
questions
 for
 each
 outcome
 domain
 for
 which
 data
 are
 available.

 the
 analyses
 reported

 this

 the
associated

5.1.
 Academic
 performance
5.1.1.
 Achievement
For
 school
 systems,
 a
 major
 aspiration
 is
 that
 VPK
 improve
 the
performance
 of
 participating
 children
 on
 the
 state
 achievement
tests
 first
 administered
 in
 3rd
 grade.
 However,
 there
 is
 an
 inter-
val
 of
 nearly
 four
 years
 between
 the
 end
 of
 pre-k
 and
 3rd
 grade
during
 which
 state
 data
 provide
 no
 direct
 information
 about
 chil-
dren’s
 achievement.
 The
 primary
 rationale
 for
 the
 ISS
 subsample,
with
 its
 annual
 assessments
 on
 WJ
 achievement
 measures,
 was
 to
shed
 light
 on
 children’s
 performance
 during
 that
 interval.
5.1.2.
 Woodcock–Johnson
 achievement
 measures
 (ISS)
Table
 7
 reports
 the
 VPK
 ITT
 and
 TOT
 effects
 for
 the
 WJ
 achieve-
ment
 measures
 administered
 to
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 from
 pre-k
through
 the
 3rd
 grade
 year.
 The
 composite
 measures
 provide
 the
best
 overall
 summary,
 but
 the
 results
 for
 the
 individual
 measures
that
 contribute
 to
 those
 composites
 are
 also
 presented.
 Table
 7
shows
 rather
 consistent
 findings
 across
 the
 achievement
 measures.
VPK
 effects
 are
 positive
 and
 statistically
 significant
 at
 the
 end
 of
the
 pre-k
 year
 with
 effect
 sizes
 for
 TOT
 impacts
 large
 enough
 to
be
 educationally
 meaningful,
 e.g.,
 by
 the
 .25
 threshold
 used
 by
 the
U.S.
 Department
 of
 Education
 What
 Works
 Clearinghouse.
 This
 is
not
 only
 true
 for
 the
 composite
 measure,
 but
 for
 each
 of
 the
 scales
represented
 in
 that
 composite
 with
 the
 exception
 of
 Oral
 Compre-
hension.
However,
 in
 later
 grades
 the
 performance
 of
 the
 children
 in
 the
control
 conditions
 converged
 with
 that
 of
 children
 in
 the
 VPK
 con-
ditions;
 that
 is,
 the
 control
 children
 caught
 up
 to
 the
 VPK
 children.
By
 the
 end
 of
 kindergarten,
 there
 were
 no
 longer
 any
 statistically
significant
 differences
 on
 most
 of
 the
 achievement
 measures
 (Pic-
ture
 Vocabulary
 is
 the
 only
 exception,
 and
 that
 difference
 is
 no
longer
 significant
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 1st
 grade
 year).
 After
 the
 kinder-
garten
 year,
 most
 of
 the
 effect
 estimates
 are
 negative,
 though
 short
of
 statistical
 significance,
 indicating
 that
 the
 control
 children
 out-
performed
 the
 children
 in
 the
 VPK
 treatment
 conditions.
The
 analyses
 that
 generated
 the
 results
 in
 Table
 7
 used
 mul-
tiple
 imputation
 for
 missing
 values;
 parallel
 analyses
 using
 only
observed
 values
 produced
 similar
 results
 for
 statistical
 conclusions
and
 effect
 size
 magnitude.
 In
 particular,
 VPK
 effects
 were
 positive
and
 statistically
 significant
 at
 the
 end
 of
 pre-k
 for
 all
 the
 achieve-
ment
 measures
 except
 Oral
 Comprehension,
 with
 null
 or
 negative
findings
 thereafter
 except
 for
 Picture
 Vocabulary
 in
 kindergarten.
To
 extrapolate
 the
 VPK
 findings
 from
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 to
 the
statewide
 population
 of
 VPK
 participants,
 the
 analyses
 reported
 in
Table
 7
 were
 repeated
 with
 application
 of
 the
 weights
 described
earlier
 that
 create
 a
 close
 match
 between
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 and
 the
statewide
 population
 on
 demographic
 characteristics
 and
 baseline
WJ  scores.
 The
 results
 in
 the
 last
 two
 columns
 of
 Table
 7
 reveal
 a
pattern
 of
 TOT
 effect
 estimates
 for
 the
 generalization
 to
 the
statewide
 population
 that
 is
 quite
 similar
 to
 the
 pattern
 in
 the
 ISS
subsample.
 The
 statewide
 estimates
 at
 the
 end
 of
 pre-k
 are
 positive
but
 smaller
 than
 those
 for
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 with
 those
 statisti-
cally
 significant
 in
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 remaining
 so
 in
 the
 statewide
estimates
 except
 for
 Applied
 Problems.
 Moreover,
 after
 pre-k
 there
are
 negative
 trends
 in
 the
 statewide
 estimates
 that
 largely
 parallel
those
 in
 the
 ISS
 subsample,
 though
 only
 a
 few
 reached
 statistical
significance.
5.1.3.
 Teacher
 ratings
 of
 preparedness
 for
 grade
 (ISS)
The
 data
 for
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 include
 teacher
 ratings
 of
how
 prepared
 children
 were
 for
 grade-level
 work
 related
 to
 lan-
guage/literacy,
 math,
 and
 social
 behavior.
 Kindergarten
 teachers
made
 their
 ratings
 near
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 school
 year;
 1st,
 2nd,
and
 3rd
 grade
 teachers
 made
 their
 ratings
 near
 the
 end
 of
 the
respective
 years.
 The
 ITT
 and
 TOT
 effects
 on
 those
 ratings
 (Table
 8)
showed
 a
 pattern
 similar
 to
 that
 found
 for
 the
 WJ  achievement
 mea-
sures
 (Table
 7).
 Early
 in
 the
 kindergarten
 year,
 teachers
 reported
that
 VPK
 participants
 were
 better
 prepared
 than
 the
 control
 group
(p
 <
 .10).
 However,
 in
 the
 later
 grades
 the
 direction
 of
 the
 effect
 was
reversed
 with
 the
 control
 group
 receiving
 higher
 ratings,
 although
none
 of
 those
 differences
 reached
 statistical
 significance.
 Moreover,
the
 weighted
 analysis
 that
 generalized
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 results
 to
the
 statewide
 VPK
 population
 showed
 the
 same
 pattern,
 giving
 no
indication
 that
 this
 finding
 was
 distinctive
 to
 the
 ISS
 subsample.
5.1.4.
 State
 achievement
 tests
 (RCT)
The
 Tennessee
 Comprehensive
 Assessment
 Program
 (TCAP)
 in
place
 during
 this
 study
 requires
 annual
 testing
 on
 reading/language
arts,
 mathematics,
 and
 science
 beginning
 in
 3rd
 grade.
 The
 3rd
grade
 scores
 on
 those
 tests
 were
 available
 for
 most
 of
 the
 chil-
dren
 in
 the
 RCT
 sample
 although
 some
 were
 retained
 in
 a
 prior
grade
 and
 thus
 had
 not
 yet
 reached
 3rd
 grade.
 However,
 as
 reported
later,
 there
 were
 no
 statistically
 significant
 differences
 in
 retention
between
 the
 VPK
 treatment
 and
 control
 groups
 by
 the
 3rd
 grade
year
 that
 would
 bias
 the
 comparisons
 of
 3rd
 grade
 TCAP
 scores
 for
children
 who
 did
 take
 the
 tests.
 Furthermore,
 our
 primary
 analysis
models
 used
 multiple
 imputation
 for
 missing
 data,
 which
 includes
the
 missing
 TCAP
 scores
 for
 retained
 children.
 Because
 imputation
for
 this
 distinctive
 situation
 is
 more
 questionable
 than
 when
 miss-
ingness
 is
 not
 so
 heavily
 influenced
 by
 a
 single
 factor,
 the
 results
 of
parallel
 analyses
 with
 only
 observed
 values
 are
 also
 reported.
The
 first
 panel
 of
 Table
 9
 presents
 the
 results
 with
 multiple
imputation
 of
 missing
 scores;
 the
 second
 panel
 shows
 the
 results
with
 only
 observed
 values.
 The
 third
 panel
 shows
 the
 results
 with
multiple
 imputation
 and
 the
 weighting
 function
 that
 matches
 the
RCT
 sample
 to
 the
 demographic
 profile
 of
 the
 statewide
 VPK
 pop-
ulation.
 All
 these
 analyses
 show
 the
 same
 pattern
 of
 VPK
 effects
on
 the
 state
 achievement
 tests.
 As
 indicated
 by
 the
 negative
 effect
coefficients
 and
 effect
 sizes,
 the
 control
 children
 outperformed

 The
 largest
VPK

 were
 for

 with
 low
 pretest

 scores.
 Conversely,
 the
 smallest
 effects
 were
 for

 children
 with

Note
 that
 the

 is
 correlated

 treatment
 con-
dition
 with
 age,
 gender,
 race,
 native
 English,
 mothers’
 education,
and
 the
 WJ  Composite
 6
 pretest
 revealed
 no
 statistically
 significant
differential
 effects
 on
 the
 WJ
 Composite
 6
 achievement
 measure
 at
the
 end
 of
 kindergarten
 or
 later
 through
 the
 2nd
 grade
 year.
 A
 small
statistical
 interaction
 with
 the
 WJ
 Composite
 6
 pretest
 (p
 <
 .07)
emerged
 in
 the
 3rd
 grade
 year,
 but
 in
 the
 opposite
 direction
 from
that
 in
 the
 pre-k
 year
 –
 the
 initially
 lowest
 scoring
 children
 whose
participation
 in
 VPK
 produced
 especially
 large
 gains
 on
 the
 Com-
posite
 6
 achievement
 measure
 during
 pre-k
 had
 fallen
 behind
 the
control
 children
 on
 that
 measure
 by
 the
 3rd
 grade
 year.
 The
 mag-
nitude
 of
 the
 effect
 can
 again
 be
 illustrated
 by
 contrasting
 the
 VPK
effect
 on
 the
 Composite
 6
 outcome
 for
 children
 scoring
 in
 the
 lowest
tertile
 with
 those
 in
 the
 upper
 tertiles
 on
 that
 measure
 at
 pretest.
For
 the
 ITT
 comparison,
 that
 representation
 yields
 effect
 sizes
 in
the
 3rd
 grade
 year
 of
 −.06
 for
 the
 initially
 lowest
 scoring
 group
and
 −.01
 for
 the
 higher
 scoring
 group.
 For
 the
 TOT
 comparison,
 the
corresponding
 effect
 sizes
 were
 −.11
 and
 −.01.
Teacher
 ratings
 of
 preparedness
 for
 grade
 level
 work
 in
 the
 years
after
 pre-k
 also
 showed
 negative
 differential
 effects
 for
 the
 children
with
 lower
 pretest
 scores
 on
 WJ
 Composite
 6
 achievement.
 Those
effects
 were
 statistically
 significant
 for
 teacher
 ratings
 at
 the
 end
 of
the
 1st,
 2nd,
 and
 3rd
 grade
 years.
 The
 effect
 sizes
 on
 those
 ratings
 for
children
 in
 the
 lowest
 tertile
 of
 the
 Composite
 6
 pretest
 compared
to
 those
 with
 higher
 scores
 for
 the
 ITT
 comparison
 (TOT
 effect
 sizes
in
 parentheses)
 were
 −.27
 vs
 .05
 (−.44
 vs
 .09)
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 1st
grade
 year,
 −.26
 vs
 .06
 (−.43
 vs
 .11)
 at
 the
 end
 of
 2nd
 grade,
 and
−.13
 vs
 .04
 (−.21
 vs
 .06)
 at
 the
 end
 of
 3rd
 grade.
Examined
 individually,
 there
 were
 a
 number
 of
 other
 statisti-
cally
 significant
 interactions
 that
 indicated
 differential
 effect
 on
 the
ratings
 of
 preparedness
 for
 grade
 after
 the
 pre-k
 year,
 in
 particu-
lar,
 for
 Black
 and
 Hispanic
 children,
 non-native
 English
 speakers,
and
 children
 with
 less
 educated
 mothers.
 However,
 all
 those
 vari-
ables
 are
 correlated
 with
 the
 baseline
 Composite
 6
 achievement
pretest.
 When
 the
 differential
 effects
 associated
 with
 that
 pretest
were
 accounted
 for
 in
 the
 analyses,
 none
 of
 these
 other
 interaction
terms
 remained
 statistically
 significant.
Further
 exploration
 was
 made
 of
 differential
 effects
 on
 the
 state
achievement
 tests
 in
 3rd
 grade
 with
 the
 full
 RCT
 sample.
 The
 data
for
 that
 sample
 do
 not
 include
 pretest
 achievement
 measures,
 so
no
 direct
 comparison
 with
 the
 results
 from
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 can
be
 made.
 The
 interactions
 of
 ITT
 treatment
 condition
 with
 age,
 gen-
der,
 race,
 and
 native
 English
 were
 tested,
 but
 none
 was
 statistically
significant
 for
 reading,
 math,
 or
 science.

5.1.6.
 Retention
 in
 grade
 (RCT)
Because
 retained
 students
 continue
 to
 lag
 behind
 their
 peers
in
 subsequent
 grades,
 we
 examined
 cumulative
 retention
 –
 the
proportion
 of
 students
 in
 each
 successive
 school
 year
 below
 the
expected
 grade
 level
 for
 that
 year
 irrespective
 of
 the
 year
 in
 which
they
 had
 been
 retained.
 Table
 11
 reports
 the
 retention
 rates
 for
 stu-
dents
 in
 the
 treatment
 and
 control
 conditions
 of
 the
 RCT
 sample.
For
 example,
 a
 K-3rd
 retention
 rate
 of
 .13
 means
 that
 13%
 of
 the
children
 were
 retained
 in
 the
 3rd
 grade
 or
 a
 prior
 year.
The
 top
 panel
 of
 Table
 11
 reports
 results
 from
 multilevel
 OLS
analysis
 with
 multiple
 imputation
 of
 missing
 data.
 Substantially
similar
 retention
 rate
 estimates
 were
 found
 with
 analyses
 of
 only
observed
 values
 (second
 panel
 of
 Table
 11),
 and
 with
 multilevel
logistic
 regression
 rather
 than
 OLS
 for
 the
 binary
 retention
 out-
comes
 each
 year
 (not
 shown).
 The
 lower
 panel
 of
 Table
 11
 presents
the
 results
 of
 the
 retention
 analyses
 with
 application
 of
 the
 weight-
ing
 function
 that
 yields
 estimates
 of
 the
 expected
 results
 if
 those
 in
the
 upper
 panel
 are
 extended
 to
 the
 statewide
 population
 of
 VPK
programs
 and
 participating
 children.
As
 Table
 11
 indicates,
 a
 somewhat
 lower
 proportion
 of
 VPK
 chil-
dren
 was
 retained
 in
 kindergarten
 than
 the
 corresponding
 control
children,
 but
 those
 differences
 were
 statistically
 significant
 only
 at
the
 p
 <
 .10
 level
 and
 only
 for
 the
 observed
 data.
 Retention
 through
1st
 grade
 reversed
 the
 proportions,
 although
 not
 statistically
 sig-
nificant.
 That
 is,
 the
 retention
 rates
 for
 the
 VPK
 groups
 caught
 up
with
 those
 for
 the
 control
 groups
 by
 1st
 grade
 and
 there
 were
 no
significant
 differences
 between
 the
 groups
 thereafter.
5.1.6.1.
 Differential
 effects
 on
 retention.
 Further
 analyses
 explored
differential
 VPK
 effects
 on
 retention
 for
 subgroups
 of
 children
identified
 by
 the
 demographic
 variables
 for
 the
 RCT
 sample
 (age,
gender,
 race,
 and
 native
 English).
 The
 only
 statistically
 significant
interaction
 with
 ITT
 treatment
 condition
 (p
 =
 .026)
 was
 for
 age
in
 kindergarten.
 While
 younger
 children
 were
 more
 likely
 to
 be
retained
 throughout
 the
 K-3rd
 grade
 period,
 the
 younger
 VPK
 par-
ticipants
 were
 less
 likely
 to
 be
 retained
 in
 kindergarten
 than
 their
counterparts
 in
 the
 control
 group.
 The
 retention
 rate
 in
 kinder-
garten
 for
 the
 VPK
 children
 below
 the
 mean
 age
 of
 their
 classmates
was
 7.0%
 versus
 11.2%
 for
 the
 corresponding
 control
 children
 in
 the
TOT
 comparison;
 the
 analogous
 difference
 for
 children
 above
 the
mean
 age
 was
 2.2%
 vs.
 3.2%.
5.2.
 Classroom
 and
 school
 behavior
5.2.1.
 Teacher
 ratings
 (ISS)
For
 the
 ISS
 subsample,
 teachers
 rated
 children’s
 behavior
 and
performance
 in
 the
 classroom
 on
 the
 Cooper–Farran
 Work-Related
Skills
 and
 Interpersonal
 Skills
 scales,
 and
 the
 ACBR
 Peer
 Relations,
Behavior
 Problems,
 and
 Feelings
 About
 School
 scales.
 Table
 12
shows
 the
 effect
 estimates
 on
 these
 measures
 through
 the
 3rd
 grade
year.
 There
 is
 no
 consistent
 direction
 in
 the
 effect
 sizes
 for
 these
ratings
 and
 none
 are
 statistically
 significant
 with
 one
 exception.
The
 1st
 grade
 teachers’
 ratings
 of
 children’s
 feelings
 about
 school
was
 statistically
 significant
 with
 VPK
 children
 having
 less
 positive
attitudes
 toward
 school
 than
 control
 children.
 Application
 of
 the
weighting
 function
 that
 extrapolated
 the
 results
 in
 Table
 12
 to
 the
statewide
 VPK
 population
 (not
 shown)
 produced
 comparable
 find-
ings
 with
 negative
 VPK
 effects
 (p
 <
 .10)
 on
 teacher
 ratings
 of
 feelings
about
 school
 in
 the
 1st
 and
 2nd
 grade
 years.
5.2.2.
 Disciplinary
 actions
 (RCT)
School
 records
 in
 the
 state
 database
 report
 expulsions
 and
 in-
school
 and
 out-of-school
 suspensions.
 The
 frequency
 of
 such
 events
is
 low,
 especially
 in
 any
 one
 school
 year.
 The
 outcome
 variable
used
 here
 thus
 aggregates
 across
 the
 K-3rd
 grade
 years
 to
 indi-
cate
 whether
 there
 were
 any
 recorded
 actions
 (yes/no)
 during
 that
period.
 The
 overall
 rates
 are
 further
 subdivided

 found
 a

 for

 (p

5.2.3.
 Attendance
 (RCT)
Attendance
 rates
 for
 children
 in
 the
 RCT
 sample
 were
 derived
from
 state
 data
 for
 kindergarten
 through
 3rd
 grade
 as
 the
 propor-
tion
 of
 instructional
 days
 for
 which
 a
 child
 did
 not
 have
 a
 recorded
absence.
 As
 shown
 in
 Table
 14,
 those
 rates
 were
 universally
 high,
around
 95%,
 and
 no
 significant
 differences
 were
 found
 between
 the
VPK
 treatment
 and
 control
 groups
 for
 any
 year.
 The
 results
 using
only
 observed
 data
 and
 applying
 the
 weighting
 function
 to
 estimate
statewide
 effects
 are
 not
 shown
 but
 are
 substantially
 similar.
5.2.4.
 Classroom
 and
 school
 behavior
 effects
 for
 different
subgroups
 of
 children
Moderator
 analyses
 were
 conducted
 for
 the
 classroom
 and
school
 outcomes
 to
 identify
 any
 differential
 effects
 for
 demo-
graphic
 subgroups
 of
 children.
 To
 accomplish
 this,
 the
 analyses
of
 main
 effects
 reported
 above
 were
 repeated
 with
 the
 addition
of
 interaction
 terms
 for
 the
 ITT
 treatment
 condition
 by
 subgroup
relationships
 at
 each
 wave
 of
 data
 collection.
5.2.5.
 Differential
 effects
 on
 teacher
 ratings
 (ISS)
Two
 patterns
 of
 differential
 VPK
 effects
 emerged
 for
 teacher
 rat-
ings
 when
 statistical
 interaction
 effects
 were
 tested
 for
 age,
 gender,
race/ethnicity,
 mother’s
 education,
 and
 pretest
 achievement
 level
in
 the
 ISS
 subsample.
 In
 2nd
 grade,
 significant
 interaction
 effects
showed
 that
 male
 VPK
 participants
 received
 more
 positive
 teacher
ratings
 than
 males
 in
 the
 control
 group
 in
 several
 domains.
 The
rating
 scales
 that
 showed
 these
 differential
 effects
 (ITT
 effect
 sizes
for
 treatment-control
 differences
 for
 males
 vs.
 those
 for
 females
 in
parentheses,
 followed
 by
 the
 corresponding
 TOT
 effect
 sizes)
 are
as
 follows:
 Cooper–Farran
 Interpersonal
 Skills
 (.11
 vs
 −.14;
 .18
 vs
−.23),
 ACBR
 Peer
 Relations
 (.16
 vs
 −.08;
 .25
 vs
 −.13),
 ACBR
 Behav-
ior
 Problems
 (-.19
 vs
 .08;
 −.32
 vs
 .14),
 and
 ACBR
 Feelings
 About
School
 (.09
 vs
 −.23;
 .14
 vs
 −.37).
 Conversely,
 female
 VPK
 partic-
ipants
 received
 less
 positive
 ratings
 than
 females
 in
 the
 control
group
 on
 these
 scales,
 as
 indicated
 by
 the
 second
 effect
 size
 in
each
 pair.
 In
 3rd
 grade,
 a
 similar
 differential
 favoring
 male
 students
appeared
 for
 ACBR
 Peer
 Relations
 (.09
 vs
 −.16;
 .14
 vs
 −.26)
 and
Cooper–Farran
 Work-Related
 Skills
 (.11
 vs
 −.06;
 .18
 vs
 −.10).
Teacher
 ratings
 also
 showed
 differential
 VPK
 effects
 for
 Black
children
 in
 contrast
 to
 their
 mainly
 White
 and
 Hispanic
 coun-
terparts.
 In
 1st
 and
 3rd
 grade
 statistically
 significant
 interactions
revealed
 higher
 ratings
 for
 Black
 VPK
 participants
 than
 for
 Black
control
 children
 on
 Cooper–Farran
 Work-Related
 Skills
 (1st
 grade:
.11
 vs
 −.17;
 .17
 vs
 −.28.
 3rd

 .20
 vs

 Differential
 effects
 on
 disciplinary
 actions
 and
 attendance
(RCT)
No
 statistically
 significant
 differential
 effects
 for
 demographic
subgroups
 were
 found
 for
 disciplinary
 outcomes.
 For
 attendance,
however,
 VPK
 effects
 were
 more
 positive
 and
 statistically
 signifi-
cant
 for
 male
 and
 for
 Black
 children
 in
 the
 2nd
 grade,
 and
 for
 Black
children
 in
 the
 3rd
 grade.
 Conversely,
 female
 and
 non-Black
 VPK
participants
 had
 lower
 attendance
 rates
 than
 the
 corresponding
control
 children.
 These
 gender
 and
 race/ethnic
 interactions
 echo
some
 of
 those
 described
 above
 for
 teacher
 ratings
 for
 male
 and
Black
 children.
 Whereas,
 there
 was
 no
 evidence
 that
 VPK
 effects
on
 achievement
 were
 stronger
 for
 those
 subgroups,
 some
 of
 their
school
 and
 classroom
 behavior
 past
 the
 pre-k
 year
 does
 appear
 to
have
 been
 positively
 affected
 by
 their
 VPK
 participation.

 Special
 education
 (RCT)
Special
 education
 services
 defined
 by
 an
 Individualized
 Edu-
cation
 Program
 (IEP)
 are
 often
 of
 interest
 as
 pre-k
 outcomes.
However,
 for
 pre-k
 programs
 like
 VPK
 that
 are
 administered
 by
 the
department
 of
 education,
 located
 mainly
 in
 schools,
 and
 staffed
 by
licensed
 teachers,
 it
 is
 not
 entirely
 clear
 how
 to
 interpret
 special
education
 placement
 rates.
 In
 those
 circumstances,
 pre-k
 students
are
 screened
 for
 special
 needs
 and
 special
 education
 services
 may
be
 provided
 as
 part
 of
 the
 pre-k
 program,
 an
 opportunity
 not
 gener-
ally
 available
 to
 the
 control
 children
 who
 are
 not
 in
 VPK
 classrooms.
Once
 begun,
 special
 education
 services
 typically
 continue
 for
 some
years,
 ending
 only
 when
 a
 formal
 determination
 is
 made
 that
 they
are
 no
 longer
 needed.
For
 VPK
 participants
 in
 the
 RCT
 sample,
 9.4%
 had
 at
 least
 one
IEP
 recorded
 in
 the
 state
 education
 database
 during
 the
 pre-k
 year
in
 a
 category
 other
 than
 physical
 disabilities
 (0.2%
 of
 the
 children)
and
 intellectually
 gifted
 (no
 children).
 Of
 these
 children,
 93%
 had
an
 IEP
 for
 speech
 or
 language
 impairment
 and
 10%
 had
 an
 IEP
 for
an
 intellectual
 disability
 (some
 had
 more
 than
 one
 IEP).
 For
 nearly
all
 of
 the
 children
 given
 an
 IEP
 in
 pre-k,
 it
 was
 continued
 into
 the
kindergarten
 year
 (93%)
 and,
 in
 most
 cases,
 for
 some
 time
 beyond
kindergarten
 (80%).
This
 early
 identification
 of
 VPK
 participants
 for
 special
 edu-
cation
 services,
 and
 continuation
 of
 that
 status
 into
 later
 grades,
creates
 an
 asymmetry
 that
 confounds
 any
 attempt
 to
 interpret
special
 education
 differences
 between
 VPK
 treatment
 and
 control
groups
 in
 later
 grades.
 Such
 differences
 might
 represent
 the
 impact
of
 pre-k,
 including
 early
 provision
 of
 special
 education
 services,
 on
later
 need
 for
 such
 services.
 But,
 they
 may
 also
 represent
 carry-
over
 of
 the
 special
 education
 designations
 from
 the
 pre-k
 year
 for
VPK
 participants
 with
 equally
 needy
 control
 children
 not
 receiving
such
 designations
 until
 kindergarten
 at
 the
 earliest.
 These
 different
effects
 cannot
 be
 disentangled
 in
 the
 data
 available
 for
 this
 study,
but
 given
 the
 rate
 of
 special
 education
 designations
 in
 pre-k
 and
the
 high
 proportion
 carried
 forward
 into
 the
 later
 grades,
 there
 is
little
 basis
 to
 doubt
 that
 carryover
 plays
 a
 role.
With
 this
 ambiguity
 about
 how
 to
 interpret
 the
 results
 in
 mind,
Table
 15
 reports
 the
 proportions
 of
 VPK
 treatment
 and
 control
 chil-
dren
 with
 recorded
 IEPs
 from
 K
 to
 the
 3rd
 grade
 year.
 The
 first
 two
panels
 report
 IEPs
 other
 than
 those
 relating
 to
 physical
 disabilities
or
 giftedness
 for
 the
 primary
 analysis
 with
 multiple
 imputation
 and
the
 parallel
 analysis
 with
 only
 observed
 values.
 The
 remaining
 pan-
els
 break
 out
 the
 different
 special
 education
 categories
 for
 analysis
with
 observed
 values,
 omitting
 physical
 disabilities.
Table
 15
 shows
 that
 a
 higher
 proportion
 of
 VPK
 children
 had
IEPs
 than
 control
 children
 in
 every
 year
 with
 differences
 that
 are
often
 statistically
 significant.
 The
 one
 exception
 is
 the
 intellectually
gifted
 category,
 where
 the
 proportions
 are
 low
 but
 favor
 the
 control
groups.
 The
 results
 for
 speech
 or
 language
 impairments
 are
 espe-
cially
 noteworthy.
 This
 is
 the
 overwhelmingly
 dominant
 category
for
 the
 early
 IEP
 designations
 for
 VPK
 participants
 and
 continues
 to
be
 so
 through
 the
 3rd
 grade
 year.
 The
 treatment-control
 differences
shrink
 somewhat
 over
 those
 years
 as
 a
 result
 of

 Black
 children.
 In
 the
early
 grades
 (K
 and
 1st),
 VPK
 participation
 was
 associated
 with
more
 IEPs
 for
 males
 relative
 to
 males
 in
 the
 control
 group;
 con-
versely
 female
 participants
 had
 fewer
 IEPs
 relative
 to
 females
 in
the
 control
 group.
 But
 those
 difference
 diminished
 in
 2nd
 and
 3rd
grade.
 For
 Black
 children,
 VPK
 participants
 had
 fewer
 IEPs
 from
 1st
through
 3rd
 grade
 than
 their
 counterparts
 in
 the
 control
 group.
6.
 Discussion
The
 results
 of
 this
 study
 of
 the
 Tennessee
 Voluntary
 Pre-K
 pro-
gram
 have
 addressed
 our
 initial
 research
 questions
 while
 raising
still
 others.
 The
 first
 of
 those
 research
 questions
 is
 about
 the
 effects
of
 VPK
 participation
 on
 literacy,
 language,
 and
 math
 skills,
 and
classroom
 behavior,
 by
 kindergarten
 entry.
 The
 second
 question
is
 whether
 any
 advantage
 of
 VPK
 participation
 carries
 forward
 to
enhance
 performance
 in
 later
 grades.
For
 the
 ISS
 subsample
 we
 found
 that
 children
 who
 participated
in
 VPK
 experienced
 considerably
 greater
 gains
 in
 literacy,
 language,
and
 math
 skills
 during
 the
 pre-k
 year
 than
 the
 control
 children,
and
 that
 this
 difference
 was
 recognized
 as
 greater
 preparedness
for
 grade
 level
 work
 by
 kindergarten
 teachers
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
the
 following
 year.
However,
 those
 positive
 VPK
 effects
 on
 achievement
 largely
 dis-
appeared
 by
 the
 end
 of
 kindergarten
 with
 children
 in
 the
 control
group
 catching
 up
 to
 the
 VPK
 participants.
 Moreover,
 by
 second
grade
 the
 performance
 of
 the
 control
 children
 surpassed
 that
 of
the
 VPK
 participants
 on
 some
 achievement
 measures.
 This
 pattern
was
 echoed
 on
 the
 3rd
 grade
 state
 achievement
 tests
 for
 the
 full
RCT
 sample.
 VPK
 participants
 scored
 lower
 on
 the
 reading,
 math,
and
 science
 tests
 than
 the
 control
 children
 with
 differences
 that
were
 statistically
 significant
 for
 math
 and
 science.
On
 other
 outcomes,
 including
 teacher
 ratings
 of
 classroom
behavior,
 retention
 in
 grade,
 disciplinary
 infractions,
 and
 atten-
dance,
 there
 were
 generally
 few
 overall
 differences
 between
 VPK
participants
 and
 control
 children
 across
 the
 years,
 although
 school
records
 did
 show
 somewhat
 more
 disciplinary
 actions
 for
 the
 vio-
lation
 of
 school
 rules
 for
 the
 VPK
 participants.
 For
 special
 education
designations,
 the
 differences
 were
 not
 so
 modest
 –
 VPK
 participants
had
 distinctly
 higher
 rates
 than
 control
 children
 that
 extended
through
 the
 3rd
 grade
 year.
 However,
 VPK
 participation
 allowed
children
 deemed
 in
 need
 of
 such
 services
 to
 be
 identified
 during
the
 pre-k
 year
 and,
 unlike
 the
 control
 children,
 to
 already
 have
 spe-
cial
 education
 designations
 when
 they
 entered
 kindergarten.
 Those
early
 designations
 persisted
 through
 later
 school
 years.
The
 third
 research
 question
 is
 whether
 some
 demographic
 sub-
groups
 of
 children
 benefited
 more
 from
 VPK
 participation
 than
others.
 Considering
 the
 number
 of
 combinations
 of
 subgroups,
outcomes,
 and
 school
 years
 involved
 in
 examining
 this
 issue,
 rela-
tively
 few
 differential
 pre-k
 effects
 were
 found.
 Children
 for
 whom
English
 was
 not
 their
 native
 language
 and
 the
 overlapping
 group
with
 low
 pretest
 achievement
 scores
 experienced
 the
 greatest
gains
 on
 the
 achievement
 measures
 during
 the
 pre-k
 year,
 but
 that
early
 advantage
 did
 not
 persist
 into
 the
 later
 grades.
 For
 school
 and
classroom
 behavior,
 there
 was
 an
 intriguing
 pattern
 of
 differential
pre-k
 effects
 on
 some
 measures
 for
 male
 and
 Black
 children.
 In
 the
years
 after
 kindergarten
 these
 children
 received
 higher
 teacher
 rat-
ings
 than
 their
 control
 counterparts
 on
 a
 mix
 of
 outcomes
 related
to
 peer
 interactions,
 appropriate
 engagement
 in
 classroom
 activ-
ities,
 and
 feelings
 about
 school,
 and
 their
 school
 records
 showed
somewhat
 higher
 attendance
 rates.
The
 generality
 of
 the
 overall
 findings
 from
 the
 samples
 of
 pro-
grams
 and
 children
 that
 provided
 the
 data
 for
 this
 study
 was
affirmed
 in
 several
 ways.
 Pre-k
 effect
 estimates
 for
 the
 consented
ISS
 subsample
 showed
 no
 pattern
 of
 statistically
 significant
 dif-
ferences
 from
 estimates
 for
 the
 remaining
 unconsented
 children
in
 the
 full
 RCT
 sample
 on
 the
 outcomes
 available
 for
 both
 groups.
These
 results
 provide
 some
 assurance
 that
 the
 consent
 procedure
did
 not
 select
 a
 subgroup
 of
 children
 for
 whom
 pre-k
 effects
 on
 out-
comes
 only
 available
 for
 them
 are
 unrepresentative
 of
 the
 effects
that
 would
 be
 expected
 for
 the
 full
 RCT
 sample.
Additionally,
 the
 fortuitous
 availability
 of
 a
 probability
 sample
of
 VPK
 programs
 and
 participants
 statewide
 made
 it
 possible
 to
extrapolate
 the
 pre-k
 effects
 found
 with
 the
 RCT
 and
 ISS
 samples
to
 the
 statewide
 VPK
 population.
 Though
 not
 definitive,
 this
 pro-
cedure
 gave
 no
 indication
 that
 the
 overall
 findings
 of
 this
 study
would
 not
 generalize
 to
 the
 statewide
 population
 of
 VPK
 programs
and
 the
 children
 who
 participate
 in
 them.
6.1.
 Issues
 raised
 by
 the
 VPK
 findings
6.1.1.
 Program
 quality
The
 unfavorable
 outcomes
 of
 the
 Tennessee
 program
 might
 be
explained
 if
 it
 is
 of
 distinctively
 poor
 quality
 and,
 as
 such,
 unrepre-
sentative
 of
 other
 state
 programs
 that
 might
 be
 assumed
 to
 be
 more
effective
 (Bustamante,
 Hirsh-Pasek,
 Vandell,
 &
 Golinkoff,
 2017).
Whether
 state
 pre-k
 programs
 generally
 are
 of
 high
 or
 low
 quality
 is
an
 open
 question,
 but
 we
 know
 of
 no
 evidence
 that
 demonstrates
that
 VPK
 is
 notably
 below
 average.
 The
 only
 attempt
 to
 compare
quality
 across
 states
 is
 in
 the
 NIEER
 reports
 that
 identify
 the
 10
standards
 NIEER
 advocates
 and
 which
 are
 met
 by
 each
 state
 pro-
gram.
 By
 those
 criteria,
 Tennessee
 has
 one
 of
 the
 better
 programs,
meeting
 9
 of
 those
 standards.
The
 results
 of
 classroom
 observations
 provide
 another
 perspec-
tive.
 Until
 recently,
 the
 most
 commonly
 used
 quality
 measure
 for
early
 childhood
 classrooms
 has
 been
 the
 Early
 Childhood
 Environ-
mental
 Rating
 System-Revised
 (ECERS-R;
 Harms,
 Clifford,
 &
 Cryer,
1998).
 ECERS-R
 data
 were
 collected
 by
 trained
 observers
 during
daylong
 mid-year
 visits
 to
 the
 classrooms
 of
 the
 statewide
 rep-
resentative
 sample
 of
 VPK
 programs
 drawn
 for
 our
 separate
 RDD
study.
 The
 average
 total
 ECERS-R
 score
 for
 VPK
 classrooms
 was
 4.15.
Scores
 that
 have
 been
 reported
 for
 other
 state
 pre-k
 programs
 show
variability
 but
 by
 our
 calculations
 average
 4.35
 (Bassok,
 Fitzpatrick,
Greenberg,
 &
 Loeb,
 2016;
 Coley,
 Votruba-Drzal,
 Collins,
 &
 Cook,
2016;
 Keys
 et
 al.,
 2012;
 Weiland,
 Ulvestad,
 Sachs,
 &
 Yoshikawa,
2013).
 Neither
 that
 average
 nor
 that
 for
 VPK
 crosses
 the
 4.5
 quality
threshold
 espoused
 by
 Burchinal
 et
 al.
 (2016),
 but
 this
 comparison
does
 not
 indicate
 distinctively
 lower
 quality
 for
 VPK
 classrooms.
The
 search
 for
 an
 evidence-based
 definition
 of
 high
 quality
 pre-k
that
 would
 better
 predict
 both
 short
 and
 long-term
 positive
 effects
is
 intensifying
 (see
 e.g.,
 Sharpe,
 Davis,
 &
 Howard,
 2017).
 However,
recent
 empirical
 approaches
 have
 not
 produced
 definitive
 results.
None
 of
 the
 widely
 used
 classroom
 assessments
 has
 been
 linked
strongly
 to
 child
 outcomes
 (Burchinal,
 2017;
 Mashburn,
 2016).
 Nor
have
 teacher
 qualifications
 been
 found
 to
 be
 consistently
 asso-
ciated
 with
 better
 child
 outcomes
 (e.g.,
 Lin
 &
 Magnuson,
 2018).

drivers
 of
 successful
 preschool
 programs
 have
 yet
 to
 be
 identified”
(Walters,
 2015,
 p.
 99).
 Recent
 work
 by
 Farran
 and
 colleagues
 has
highlighted
 promising
 features
 of
 classroom
 interactions
 predictive
of
 child
 growth
 (Farran,
 Meador,
 Christopher,
 Nesbitt,
 &
 Bilbrey,
2017),
 but
 data
 on
 those
 interactions
 are
 expensive
 to
 collect
 and
are
 not
 included
 in
 any
 current
 widely
 used
 classroom
 assessments.
The
 upshot
 of
 this
 fluid
 research
 enterprise
 is
 that
 we  do
 not
yet
 have
 a
 basis
 for
 improving
 state-funded
 pre-k
 programs
 that
is
 grounded
 in
 empirical
 evidence
 relating
 program
 characteristics
to
 child
 outcomes.
 The
 most
 direct
 quality
 index
 we  have
 may
 be
the
 nature
 and
 magnitude
 of
 the
 impact
 a
 pre-k
 program
 actually
has
 on
 outcomes
 that
 are
 consequential
 for
 participating
 children.
This
 perspective
 is
 clouded
 by
 uncertainty
 about
 which
 outcomes
 in
fact
 are
 most
 consequential
 (Bailey
 et
 al.,
 2017).
 The
 study
 reported
here
 demonstrates
 that
 VPK
 has
 substantial
 impact
 on
 a
 number
 of
widely
 used
 outcome
 measures
 during
 the
 pre-k
 year,
 but
 longer-
term
 effects
 were
 largely
 null
 or
 even
 negative.
 Judged
 by
 effects
on
 child
 outcomes,
 these
 findings
 present
 a
 mixed
 picture.
 Whether
other
 state
 programs
 have
 larger
 or
 longer
 lasting
 effects
 is
 difficult
to
 assess
 in
 light
 of
 the
 limited
 and
 methodologically
 problematic
research
 available
 on
 other
 programs
 described
 in
 the
 introduction
to
 this
 paper.
 But
 if
 further
 research
 demonstrates
 that
 they
 do,
it
 is
 imperative
 that
 researchers
 also
 provide
 detailed
 information
about
 the
 practices
 that
 led
 to
 those
 outcomes.
6.1.2.
 The
 counterfactual
All
 evaluations
 of
 the
 effects
 of
 programs
 and
 policies
 must
assess
 them
 against
 a
 counterfactual
 condition,
 meaning
 in
 the
case
 of
 pre-k,
 what
 children
 would
 experience
 if
 they
 were
 not
 in
 a
pre-k
 program.
 The
 small
 experimental
 programs
 of
 the
 late
 1950s
through
 the
 early
 1970s
 that
 have
 such
 a
 high
 profile
 in
 discussions
of
 the
 benefits
 expected
 from
 public
 pre-k
 served
 primarily
 poor
African
 American
 children
 (Darlington,
 Royce,
 Snipper,
 Murray,
 &
Lazar,
 1980)
 during
 an
 era
 of
 segregation
 and
 immense
 poverty
(Jencks,
 1972).
Young
 children
 today
 are
 different.
 Between
 1998
 and
 2010
disparities
 in
 school
 readiness
 between
 children
 from
 lower
 and
higher
 income
 families
 narrowed
 despite
 sharp
 increases
 in
 the
income
 gap
 and
 segregation
 in
 housing
 and
 schools
 (Reardon
&
 Portilla,
 2016).
 Reasons
 for
 this
 surprising
 finding
 have
 to
be
 speculative,
 but
 Bassok,
 Finch,
 Lee,
 Reardon,
 and
 Waldfogel
(2016)
 document
 changes
 in
 parenting
 practices
 that
 may
 be
 rele-
vant.
 Comparing
 1998–2010,
 they
 found
 that
 parents
 increasingly
structured
 their
 children’s
 experiences
 to
 focus
 on
 learning
 oppor-
tunities
 such
 as
 those
 that
 involve
 computer
 access,
 more
 books
in
 the
 home,
 and
 enrichment
 activities
 organized
 specifically
 for
children.
 It
 is
 especially
 notable
 that
 the
 socioeconomic
 gap
 in
these
 practices
 narrowed
 over
 this
 period
 with
 low-income
 parents
showing
 stronger
 increases
 in
 their
 investments
 in
 their
 children
than
 more
 affluent
 parents.
The
 greater
 contrast
 between
 the
 earlier
 counterfactual
 for
preschool
 and
 the
 contemporary
 counterfactual
 is
 evident
 in
 the
effect
 sizes
 found
 in
 the
 Perry
 Preschool
 and
 Abecedarian
 stud-
ies,
 which
 are
 three
 times
 larger
 than
 those
 found
 for
 programs
evaluated
 in
 the
 past
 15
 years
 (Duncan
 &
 Magnuson,
 2013).
 With
smaller
 families
 (Angier,
 2013),
 exposure
 to
 Sesame
 Street
 (Kearney
&
 Levine,
 2015),
 and
 access
 to
 the
 Internet
 even
 for
 young,
 poor
children
 (Rideout
 &
 Katz,
 2016),
 early
 childhood
 experiences
 are
very
 different
 in
 the
 21st
 century.
 Contemporary
 pre-k
 programs
that,
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 course,
 only
 provide
 a
 more
 concentrated
 ver-
sion
 of
 what
 children
 would
 otherwise
 experience
 are
 unlikely
 to
lead
 to
 the
 strong
 effects
 seen
 50
 years
 ago.
6.1.3.
 Public
 school
 involvement
 in
 pre-kindergarten
 programs
The
 issue
 of
 the
 appropriate
 vision
 for
 early
 childhood
 education
raises
 the
 perennial
 question
 of
 which
 agency
 should
 administer
pre-k
 programs.
 Departments
 of
 health
 and
 human
 services
 and
education
 have
 been
 the
 primary
 contenders.
 As
 states
 and
 the
 fed-
eral
 government
 increase
 funding
 for
 pre-k,
 education
 is
 becoming
the
 lead
 agency
 and
 pre-k
 classrooms
 are
 more
 often
 located
 in
public
 elementary
 schools
 (94%
 in
 Tennessee)
 than
 in
 community-
based
 early
 childhood
 centers.
One
 consequence
 of
 this
 trend
 is
 reflected
 in
 our
 finding
 that
more
 VPK
 children
 than
 control
 children
 were
 identified
 for
 spe-
cial
 education
 in
 contrast
 to
 what
 earlier
 studies
 led
 the
 field
to
 expect
 (an
 expectation
 central
 to
 return-on-investment
 strate-
gies
 like
 Pay
 for
 Success;
 http://www.payforsuccess.org/learn/
issues#early-childhood-education).
 Children
 who
 enter
 the
 public
school
 system
 a
 year
 before
 kindergarten
 not
 only
 have
 a
 greater
chance
 of
 being
 identified
 for
 special
 services
 prior
 to
 kindergarten
entry,
 but
 their
 varied
 developmental
 progress
 at
 that
 younger
 age
may
 cause
 more
 of
 them
 to
 be
 identified
 than
 would
 be
 the
 case
 a
year
 later.
 It
 is
 notable
 in
 this
 regard
 that
 the
 overwhelming
 major-
ity
 of
 special
 education
 designations
 in
 VPK
 were
 for
 speech
 and
language
 issues,
 a
 domain
 in
 which
 development
 is
 especially
 var-
ied
 for
 4-year
 olds.
 Once
 a
 child
 has
 received
 a
 special
 education
designation,
 it
 is
 difficult
 to
 lose
 it.
 While
 early
 special
 education
intervention
 may
 be
 a
 good
 thing
 in
 the
 long
 run
 for
 the
 children
involved,
 the
 expectation
 that
 school-based
 pre-k
 will
 lead
 to
 rather
immediate
 reductions
 in
 special
 education
 rates
 may
 be
 unrealistic.
Questions
 about
 the
 consequences
 of
 an
 increasing
 public
 school
dominance
 of
 pre-k
 programs
 have
 existed
 for
 years
 (e.g.,
 Rescorla,
Hyson,
 &
 Hirsh-Pasek,
 1991).
 Some
 scholars
 have
 argued
 that
 a
focus
 on
 social–emotional
 development
 and
 self-regulation
 skills
 is
especially
 important
 for
 children
 of
 preschool
 age
 as
 a
 foundation
for
 later
 academic
 success
 (e.g.,
 Bierman,
 Greenberg,
 &
 Abenavoli,
2016).
 Public
 schools,
 however,
 have
 increasingly
 prioritized
 con-
tent
 and
 skills
 related
 to
 academic
 achievement
 in
 recent
 decades
with
 effects
 that
 have
 crept
 into
 pre-k
 and
 are
 evident
 in
 kinder-
garten
 (Bassok,
 Latham,
 &
 Rorem,
 2016;
 Brown,
 2009).
 McCabe
 and
Sipple
 (2011)
 characterized
 the
 relationship
 between
 early
 child-
hood
 education
 and
 the
 public
 schools
 as
 “colliding
 worlds,”
 and
cautioned
 that
 the
 gathering
 momentum
 of
 public
 school
 involve-
ment
 in
 pre-k
 education
 was
 occurring
 without
 a
 full
 appreciation
of
 the
 complexity
 of
 providing
 quality
 education
 for
 young
 children.
If
 public
 pre-k
 is
 to
 be
 offered
 through
 the
 public
 school
 system,
 new
fundamental
 empirical
 work
 may
 be
 required
 to
 identify
 the
 appro-
priate
 goals
 and
 associated
 instructional
 practices
 most
 important
for
 young
 children’s
 development
 in
 that
 environment.
6.1.4.
 Alignment
 with
 K-3
Finally,
 our
 findings
 highlight
 the
 importance
 of
 the
 K-3
 expe-
rience.
 One
 possible
 explanation
 for
 why
 the
 gains
 children
 made
in
 VPK
 did
 not
 continue
 to
 advantage
 them
 afterwards
 is
 failure
 of
kindergarten
 and
 later
 teachers
 to
 build
 on
 the
 skills
 those
 children
bring
 from
 their
 pre-k
 experience
 (Stipek,
 Franke,
 Clements,
 Farran,
&
 Coburn,
 2017).
 For
 instance,
 teachers
 may
 teach
 to
 the
 children
who
 need
 it
 the
 most
 while
 learning
 for
 more
 advanced
 children
languishes.
 While
 this
 is
 an
 empirical
 question
 we
 do
 not
 yet
 have
sufficient
 data
 to
 address,
 explorations
 of
 kindergarten
 teaching
suggest
 that
 many
 teachers
 may
 be
 out
 of
 touch
 with
 the
 skills
 chil-
dren
 bring
 to
 their
 classrooms.
 Claessens,
 Engel,
 and
 Curran
 (2014),
for
 example,
 found
 that,
 rather
 than
 focusing
 on
 children
 with
 the
greatest
 need,
 kindergarten
 teachers
 provided
 relatively
 undiffer-
entiated
 instruction
 that
 covered
 skills
 many
 children
 had
 already
mastered.
Children
 in
 VPK
 classrooms
 and
 their
 counterparts
 in
 the
 con-
trol
 group
 were
 eligible
 for
 the
 program
 because
 their
 families
 were
impoverished.
 VPK
 participants
 showed
 meaningful

gains
 during
 the
 pre-k
 year
 relative
 to
 control
 children,
 but
 after
pre-k
 most
 then
 attended
 high
 poverty
 and
 generally
 low
 perform-
ing
 schools.

 concern
 from

 findings
 is

of
 both
 the
 VPK
 and
 control
 children
 began
 to
 decline
 in
 2nd
 and
3rd
 grade
 relative
 to
 the
 national
 norms
 for
 the
 Woodcock–Johnson
tests
 we
 used.
 While
 Reardon
 (2011)
 has
 rightfully
 called
 attention
to
 the
 widening
 achievement
 gap
 between
 the
 rich
 and
 the
 poor,
it
 is
 important
 to
 determine
 when
 that
 actually
 begins.
 Our
 data
suggest
 that
 children
 were
 responsive
 to
 their
 first
 introduction
 to
formal
 schooling,
 whether
 in
 pre-k
 or
 kindergarten,
 no
 matter
 what
their
 skills
 upon
 entry.
 But
 their
 1st
 through
 3rd
 grade
 instructional
experiences
 did
 not
 maintain
 their
 momentum.
 It
 is
 doubtful
 that
anything
 done
 in
 pre-k
 can
 have
 sustained
 effects
 if
 the
 gains
 made
there
 are
 not
 supported
 and
 extended
 in
 the
 schooling
 that
 follows.
7.
 Conclusion
We
 are
 mindful
 of
 the
 limitations
 of
 any
 one
 study,
 no
 matter
how
 well
 done,
 and
 the
 need
 for
 a
 robust
 body
 of
 research
 before
firm
 conclusions
 are
 drawn.
 Nonetheless,
 the
 inauspicious
 find-
ings
 of
 the
 current
 study
 offer
 a
 cautionary
 tale
 about
 expecting
too
 much
 from
 state
 pre-k
 programs.
 The
 fact
 that
 the
 Head
 Start
Impact
 study
 –
 the
 only
 other
 randomized
 study
 of
 a
 contempo-
rary
 publicly
 funded
 pre-k
 program
 –
 also
 found
 few
 positive
 effects
after
 the
 pre-k
 year
 adds
 further
 cautions
 (Puma
 et
 al.,
 2012).
 State-
funded
 pre-k
 is
 a
 popular
 idea,
 but
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 the
 children
and
 the
 promise
 of
 pre-k,
 credible
 evidence
 that
 a
 rather
 typical
state
 pre-k
 program
 is
 not
 accomplishing
 its
 goals
 should
 provoke
some
 reassessment.
 It
 is
 apparent
 that
 the
 phrase
 “high-quality
pre-k”
 does
 not
 convey
 enough
 about
 what
 the
 critical
 elements
of
 a
 program
 should
 be.
 Now
 is
 the
 time
 to
 pay
 careful
 attention
 to
whether
 the
 country’s
 youngest
 and
 most
 vulnerable
 children
 are
well
 served
 in
 the
 pre-k
 classroom
 environments
 currently
 oper-
ated
 and
 to
 explore
 innovations
 with
 the
 potential
 to
 serve
 them
better.
