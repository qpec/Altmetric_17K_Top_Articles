IMPORTANCE Patient-reported outcomes should be collected using validated questionnaires
prior to and following laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery.
OBJECTIVE To report the frequency of patient-reported visual symptoms, dry eye symptoms,
satisfaction with vision, and satisfaction with LASIK surgery in the Patient-Reported
Outcomes With LASIK (PROWL) studies.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The PROWL-1 and PROWL-2 studies were prospective,
observational studies conducted from September 13, 2011, to June 27, 2014. The PROWL-1
study was a single–military center study of 262 active-duty Navy personnel 21 to 52 years of
age. The PROWL-2 study was a study of 312 civilians 21 to 57 years of age conducted at 5
private practice and academic centers. The LASIK surgery and the postoperative care were
performed based on the usual practice and clinical judgment at the site. Participants
completed a self-administered, web-based questionnaire, preoperatively and postoperatively
at 1 and 3 months (the PROWL-1 and -2 studies) and at 6 months (the PROWL-2 study).
EXPOSURES Participants underwent LASIK surgery for myopia, hyperopia, and/or astigmatism.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Visual symptoms (double images, glare, halos, and/or
starbursts), dry eye symptoms, participant satisfaction (with vision and LASIK surgery),
and clinical measures (visual acuity, refractive error, and slitlamp and posterior segment eye
examination findings) were assessed preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively.
RESULTS A total of 262 participants were enrolled in the PROWL-1 study (mean [SD] age, 29.1
[6.1] years), and a total of 312 participants were enrolled in the PROWL-2 study (mean [SD]
age, 31.5 [7.3] years). Visual symptoms and dissatisfaction with vision were common
preoperatively. Overall, the prevalence of visual symptoms and dry eye symptoms decreased,
although a substantial percentage of participants reported new visual symptoms after
surgery (43% [95% CI, 31%-55%] from the PROWL-1 study and 46% [95% CI, 33%-58%]
from the PROWL-2 study at 3 months). The percentages of participants in the PROWL-1 study
with normal Ocular Surface Disease Index scores were 55% (95% CI, 48%-61%) at baseline,
66% (95% CI, 59%-72%) at 3 months, and 73% (95% CI, 67%-79%) at 6 months. The
percentages of participants in the PROWL-2 study with normal Ocular Surface Disease Index
scores were 44% (95% CI, 38%-50%) at baseline and 65% (95% CI, 59%-71%) at 3 months.
Of those participants who had normal scores at baseline in both the PROWL-1 and -2 studies,
about 28% (95% CI, 19%-37%) had mild, moderate, or severe dry eye symptoms at 3 months.
While most participants were satisfied, the rates of dissatisfaction with vision ranged from 1%
(95% CI, 0%-4%) to 4% (95% CI, 2%-7%), and the rates of dissatisfaction with surgery
ranged from 1% (95% CI, 0%-4%) to 2% (95% CI, 1%-5%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The systematic administration of a questionnaire to patients
who have undergone LASIK surgery is a new approach to assess symptoms and satisfaction.
Our findings support the need for adequate counseling about the possibility of developing
new symptoms after LASIK surgery.

T
he safety and effectiveness of laser in situ keratomileu-
sis (LASIK) has been documented.1-6 Some patients,
however, report dry eye symptoms; problems with vi-
sion related to the presence of glare, halos, or starbursts; and
dissatisfaction following LASIK surgery.7-11 An enhanced un-
derstanding of the patient’
s experience following LASIK sur-
geryrequiresquestionnairesdesignedtoassessvisualandocu-
lar symptoms and their effect on activities of daily living.
PreviousstudiesmeasuringtheassociationofLASIKwithqual-
ity of life have not focused on the effect of these symptoms
on patients or have been limited by the use of questionnaires
withincompletelyreportedpsychometricproperties.10,12-14Pa-
tient satisfaction has been assessed in many studies using only
a single question and without examining associations with vi-
sual and ocular symptoms.15-21 The Patient-Reported Out-
comes With LASIK (PROWL) studies were conducted with the
primary objective to evaluate the measurement properties of
thePROWLquestionnaire.22Exploratoryanalysesofthepreva-
lence of functional limitations and satisfaction/dissatisfac-
tion with the procedure are reported in this study.
Methods
The PROWL-1 and -2 studies were prospective, observational
cohort studies of participants undergoing LASIK surgery for
myopia, hyperopia, and/or astigmatism. The PROWL-1 study
was a single-center study of active-duty Navy military per-
sonnel; the study protocol was approved by the Naval Medi-
cal Center San Diego institutional review board in compli-
ance with all applicable federal regulations governing the
protection of human subjects. The PROWL-2 study was con-
ducted at 5 private practice and academic centers. The
PROWL-2 study was conducted under the US Food and Drug
Administration Research Involving Human Subjects Commit-
tee, a central institutional review board for 3 sites, and uni-
versity institutional review boards for 2 sites (Johns Hopkins
University and Stanford University).
Ethics reviews and approvals were conducted and ob-
tained by the institutional review boards of all the participat-
ing sites in both studies. All enrolled study participants pro-
vided written and oral informed consent. The participants in
the PROWL-1 study did not receive any financial compensa-
tion per the rules of the military. The participants in the
PROWL-2 study were compensated. The PROWL studies, al-
though not clinical trials, are registered at Clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT0152629 and NCT01655420 for the PROWL-1 and -2 stud-
ies, respectively). Both studies were compliant with the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and adhered to
the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.23
The PROWL-1 and PROWL-2 studies enrolled partici-
pants 21 years of age or older who had not had any form of re-
fractive surgery and were determined to be good candidates
forLASIKsurgerybasedoneachinvestigator’
sassessment.De-
tails on enrollment criteria for the studies are summarized
elsewhere.22
Unlike the experimental study design of clinical trials used
to assess the safety and effectiveness of the lasers used in
LASIKsurgery,thisobservationalstudydidnotspecifythecare
of the participants but limited the enrollment of participants
to be consistent with the device label. Data on visual acuity,
refractive error, slitlamp observations, dry eye signs, and ad-
verse events were collected. All other surgical and periopera-
tive care was administered according to the surgeon’
s usual
practices. Participants were evaluated at baseline and post-
operatively at 1 and 3 months (in the PROWL-1 and -2 studies)
and at 6 months (in the PROWL-1 study). The durations of the
studies were selected to evaluate the responsiveness of the
questionnaire. The LASIK ablation was performed using la-
sers approved by the US Food and Drug Administration at the
investigational site. Participants completed the question-
naires using a secure website. The sites did not have access to
any participant’
s questionnaire data.
Each visual symptom (ie, halos, starbursts, glare, and
double images) was accompanied by a definition and illustra-
tion showing gradations of symptom severity to use when an-
swering the 8 questions for that symptom. Each item re-
sponsewastransformedlinearlytoascorewithapossiblerange
of 0 to 100 (with a higher score indicating a better condition).
A scale score for each of the 4 visual symptoms was created
by averaging the responses to the 8 questions.
Satisfaction with vision was assessed using a single item
with 6 possible responses, ranging from “completely dissat-
isfied” to “completely satisfied.
” Satisfaction with surgery was
assessed with 8 items averaged together to produce a scale
score from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating greater sat-
isfaction.TheOcularSurfaceDiseaseIndex(OSDI)scores,rang-
ing from 0 to 100, were grouped as described by Miller et al24
and Schiffman et al.25
All the participants enrolled in the 2 studies are defined as
the enrolled cohort. Analyses of clinical measures were per-
formed for those who had LASIK surgery, and these partici-
pants were defined as the surgical cohort. The analytical co-
hort, which is the term used for all PRO analyses, comprised
participantswhosubmittedthepreoperativequestionnaireand
at least 1 postoperative questionnaire. Descriptive and inferen-
tial statistics were computed for all the variables using SAS
Key Points
Question What are the rates of visual and ocular symptoms and
the satisfaction prevalence among civilian and military patients
who underwent laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery?
Findings In 2 prospective, observational studies of participants
undergoing LASIK surgery for myopia, hyperopia, and/or
astigmatism, a large proportion reported decreases in visual
symptoms, while many participants without visual symptoms at
baseline developed symptoms following the procedure;
participants were more likely to report visual symptoms on the
questionnaire than to their health care professionals. Although
visual symptoms were common, few participants reported
functionally important limitations due to symptoms.
Meaning These findings suggest that the systematic
administration of a valid questionnaire to patients who had
undergone LASIK surgery more accurately assesses symptoms and
satisfaction.

version 9.3 (SAS Institute). A visual symptom was considered
present if the respondent reported it with or without correc-
tion.Wedefinedthemoreproblematicvisualsymptomsasthose
with responses in the 2 highest categories on items that elicit
degree of “bother” and degree of difficulty with activities. All
participants who reported being “mildly,” “very,” or “ex-
tremely” dissatisfied with vision were categorized as “dissat-
isfied with vision.
” To create a similar grouping for the multi-
itemsatisfactionwithsurgeryscale,wecategorizedparticipants
withscoresof40orloweras“dissatisfiedwithsurgery”(atleast
“mildly dissatisfied” on the vision satisfaction scale) and those
with scores of higher than 40 as “satisfied with surgery.
”
Exploratory analyses assessed the potential influence of
various factors on satisfaction and symptoms scores. All cor-
relations were performed using Spearman rank-order corre-
lation coefficients. Correlations between visual symptom
scores and the following were estimated: optical aberrations,
OSDI scores, preoperative myopic manifest refraction spheri-
cal equivalent, and postoperative uncorrected visual acuity
(UCVA) and manifest cylinder. Correlations between satisfac-
tion scores and the following were calculated: OSDI scores, vi-
sual symptoms scores, and UCVA. (For manifest refraction
sphericalequivalent,UCVA,andcylinder,weusedtheeyewith
themoreextremevalue.)Correlationsoflessthan0.3werecon-
sidered low. We explored the associations between satisfac-
tion scores of subgroups by calculating P values using the
Mann-Whitney test. Because all analyses were exploratory, we
did not adjust for multiplicity in testing. P ≤ .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 262 participants enrolled in the PROWL-1 study, and
a total of 312 participants enrolled into the PROWL-2 study
(Table 1). Of these, 242 participants in the PROWL-1 study and
292 participants in the PROWL-2 study had LASIK surgery. The
percentages of surgically treated participants seen in the clinic
were 97%, 93%, and 86% at 1, 3, and 6 months for the PROWL-1
study, respectively, and 97% and 92% at 1 and 3 months for the
PROWL-2study,respectively.Themostcommonreasonforloss
to follow-up in the PROWL-1 study was deployment or trans-
fer to a new military duty station. In the PROWL-2 study, the
reasons for loss to follow-up were rarely provided. Compared
with the participants in the PROWL-1 study, the participants
in the PROWL-2 study were more often female, white, and, on
average, 2 years older. Data on mean refractive error, sex, race,
and age were similar in the enrolled, surgical, and analytical
cohorts in both studies (Table 1).
Awavefront-guidedexcimerlaserablationprofilewasused
in 45% of the PROWL-1 procedures and in 33% of the PROWL-2
procedures. A standardized aspheric ablation algorithm was
used in 55% of the PROWL-1 procedures and in 64% of the
PROWL-2 procedures. A conventional excimer laser ablation
profile was used in 3% of the PROWL-2 procedures and in none
of the PROWL-1 procedures. Flaps were created by femtosec-
ond laser keratomes in 100% of the PROWL-1 procedures and
in 98% of the PROWL-2 procedures.
Adverse events, intraoperative complications, and clini-
cal outcomes are summarized in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
The distributions of Oxford grades are shown in eTable 2 in the
Supplement.
The percentages of participants in the PROWL-1 study with
normal OSDI scores increased postoperatively from baseline
(Table 2). Of those participants who had normal OSDI scores at
baseline, 27% (95% CI, 20%-36%) of the participants in the
PROWL-1 study and 28% (95% CI, 19%-37%) of the participants
inthePROWL-2studyhaddryeyesymptomsat3months.Ofthe
participants who had mild, moderate, or severe OSDI scores at
baseline, 59% (95% CI, 49%-69%) of participants in both stud-
ies reported normal OSDI scores at 3 months.
Spearman correlations between OSDI (symptoms) and Ox-
fordscores(signs)preoperativelyandpostoperativelywerenot
significant except for in the PROWL-2 study at 3 months
(rs = 0.19, P = .004). Two or fewer participants in each study
had Oxford scores greater than 2 at 3 or 6 months postopera-
tively, making further analyses uninformative.

28% [95% CI, 23%-34%]) (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

reported no visual symptoms at baseline, 43% (95% CI, 31%-
55%) and 46% (95% CI, 33%-58%) of PROWL-1 and PROWL-2
participants, respectively, reported a new visual symptom at
3 months. The most common newly reported symptoms to de-
velop postoperatively were halos and starbursts. Among par-
ticipants with visual symptoms at baseline, 46% (95% CI, 38%-
55%) of participants in the PROWL-1 study and 34% (95% CI,
27%-41%) of participants in the PROWL-2 study reported no
visual symptoms at 3 months. Double images were the most
common symptoms to resolve in both studies.
Assessing the degree of development of new symptoms or
loss of symptoms is difficult because it is affected by regres-
sion to the mean. This can be seen with the preoperative test-
retest data, where 14% (95% CI, 3%-35%) to 29% (95% CI, 13%-
49%) of participants answered that they either did or did not
have a symptom on the test and vice versa on the retest (data
not shown).
For each type of visual symptom, difficulty performing
usual activities due to symptoms was reported by less than 1%
of participants in each study. In both studies, very or ex-
tremelybothersomesymptomswerereportedbyasmallerper-
centage of participants at 3 months postoperatively than at
baseline (Table 3).
Examining the association of dry eye symptoms with the
development of visual symptoms revealed a trend for a greater
percentage of participants reporting new visual symptoms to
have moderate to severe postoperative OSDI scores than par-
ticipants who did not report new visual symptoms (in the
PROWL-1 study, 6% [95% CI, 1%-21%] vs 2% [95% CI, 0%-

a Of 20 participants in the PROWL-1 study, 9 decided not to proceed with surgery for various reasons (eg, deployment or change in schedule), 7 switched from LASIK
to photorefractive keratectomy, and 4 were determined not to be good candidates for LASIK (eg, metallic foreign body, corneal irregularity, or unstable refraction).
bOf 20 participants in the PROWL-2 study, 16 decided not to proceed with surgery for various reasons (eg, cost or scheduling). Of the remaining 4 participants, 2
underwent photorefractive keratectomy per the surgeon’
s recommendation, 1 had surgery scheduled outside of the appropriate visit window, and 1 had loss of
suction during surgery, which prompted the aborting of the procedure.

worse visual symptom scores (more severe visual symptoms)
were modestly associated with increasing OSDI severity

scales) and OSDI at 3 and 6 months, with lower satisfaction as-
sociated with greater dry eye symptoms (Figure 2). Satisfac-
tion scores at 3 and 6 months generally showed low to mod-
erate correlations (ranging from 0.24 to 0.43) with visual
symptoms scores (most rs ≥ 0.30; P < .001 for all; eTable 5 in
the Supplement).
Correlations of logMAR UCVA (poorer eye) with satisfac-
tion scores ranged from −0.24 to −0.29 in both studies at 3
months. This may have been observed because few eyes had
UCVA ≤ 20/40 postoperatively. In the PROWL-2 study, eyes
with UCVA ≤ 20/40 had significantly lower satisfaction scores
than eyes with better acuity (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Participants using corrective lenses postoperatively re-
ported significantly poorer satisfaction scores than other par-
ticipants, with the exception of satisfaction with surgery in the
PROWL-2 study at 3 months. For adverse events/intraopera-
tive complications, inconsistent and nonsignificant reduc-
tions in satisfaction scores were reported (eTable 6 in the
Supplement).
Discussion
The reluctance of patients to report “negative” events to their
healthcareprofessionalhasbeendocumented.26,27Theadmin-
istration of the questionnaires in a private location with the as-
surance that the health care professional would not see the re-
sponses has been reported to increase unbiased reporting by
patients.16,28Insomepriorstudies,theprevalenceofvisualsymp-
toms following LASIK surgery was measured by interviewer-

To our knowledge, our study is one of the few that have
reported the development of new visual symptoms. While the
overall prevalence of visual symptoms decreased, a large per-
centage of participants with no symptoms preoperatively re-
ported new visual symptoms postoperatively. How much of
this was regression to the mean and how much a develop-
ment of new symptoms cannot be determined. Unlike prior
studies, we did not observe associations between visual symp-
toms and optical aberrations, high baseline myopia, poor

symptoms in clinical trials.
While many studies were not specific about the aspects of
satisfaction evaluated (eg, satisfaction with vision or satisfac-
tion with surgery), reported satisfaction rates after LASIK sur-
gery ranged from 82% to 98%.8,46,47 In the PROWL studies, sat-
isfaction with vision increased from baseline, but 1% (95% CI,
0%-4%) to 4% (95% CI, 2%-7%) of participants had some level
of dissatisfaction with vision 3 to 6 months after surgery. The
total number of dissatisfied participants in the PROWL stud-
ieswastoosmalltoassessassociationswithotherfactors.Simi-
lar to other studies,9,11,12,21,42,48 we found that lower satisfac-
tion with vision and surgery was often associated with worse
dry eye and visual symptom scores and the use of corrective
lenses. To better understand which patients are more likely to
be dissatisfied postoperatively, a large observational study, in-
cluding participants with long-term follow-up after LASIK sur-
gery, would be necessary to accurately estimate the preva-
lence and find useful predictors for these perceptions.
Limitations and Strengths
Our PROWL studies were primarily designed with an
adequate sample size to evaluate the questionnaire rather
than to report on outcomes. As such, the limitations of the
study included a sample that may not generalize to all per-
sons undergoing LASIK surgery, a sample size that was too
small for confidence about uncommon events, and short-
term follow-up. It is possible that participants were more
likely reporting satisfaction in an attempt to be consistent
with and justify their choice to have surgery, leading to an
underestimation of symptom rates and an overestimation of
satisfaction rates. Longer-duration studies need to be per-
formed to evaluate this possibility. Given the main purpose
of the PROWL studies, participants were not followed up
long enough to obtain long-term data on symptoms and sat-
isfaction. However, the 6-month data from the PROWL-1
study showed a further decrease in the prevalence of visual
symptoms compared with the 3-month data. This is consis-
tent with previous reports demonstrating improvement in
visual symptoms with time after surgery.8
Despite the limitations, the studies had many strengths,
including the use of a psychometrically sound questionnaire
to assess concepts and the consistency of the findings in a ci-
vilian and a military population.22 By administering the ques-
tionnaire preoperatively and at multiple postoperative visits,
we were able to measure changes during the perioperative pe-
riod. In addition, these studies provide demographically di-
verse participants from different surgical practices.
To mitigate socially desirable reporting of visual symp-
toms, we included a measure of social desirability, which
suggested that this did not impact our findings. In addition,
underreporting of subjective symptoms (eg, so as not to dis-
please the physician) was minimized by the systematic sepa-
ration of the patients’ questionnaire responses from the
health care professionals (online self-administration of the
questionnaire, which would not be available to the health
care professional).
By making the PROWL questionnaire publicly available,
the ophthalmic community will have a tool to conduct fur-
ther research on LASIK surgery. Administering the question-
naire to patients preoperatively and postoperatively will
allow us to more accurately assesses visual and ocular symp-
toms and satisfaction in clinical trials. A better understand-
ing of the patients’perceptions following this procedure will
lead to better outcomes and will provide better information
for informed consent to patients considering LASIK surgery.
