ABSTRACT
Objective: Hypothalamic Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and Neuropeptide Y/Agouti-Related Peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons are critical nodes of a
circuit within the brain that sense key metabolic cues as well as regulate metabolism. Importantly, these neurons retain an innate ability to rapidly
reorganize synaptic inputs and electrophysiological properties in response to metabolic state. While the cellular properties of these neurons have
been investigated in the context of obesity, much less is known about the effects of exercise training.
Methods: In order to further investigate this issue, we utilized neuron-specific transgenic mouse models to identify POMC and NPY/AgRP
neurons for patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments.
Results: Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found exercise depolarized and increased firing rate of arcuate POMC neurons. The
increased excitability of POMC neurons was concomitant with increased excitatory inputs to these neurons. In agreement with recent work
suggesting leptin plays an important role in the synaptic (re)organization of POMC neurons, POMC neurons which express leptin receptors were
more sensitive to exercise-induced changes in biophysical properties. Opposite to effects observed in POMC neurons, NPY neurons were shunted
toward inhibition following exercise.
Conclusions: Together, these data support a rapid reorganization of synaptic inputs and biophysical properties in response to exercise, which
may facilitate adaptations to altered energy balance and glucose metabolism.

1. INTRODUCTION
Exercise (single bout and/or chronic training) increases insulin
sensitivity leading to improved insulin stimulated glucose uptake
in
muscle
and
reduced
basal
hepatic
glucose
production
[7,8,10,11,15,17,20,22,45,60]. Within the arcuate nucleus, the mel-
anocortin system is an interface between signals of metabolic state
and neural pathways governing energy balance and glucose meta-
bolism [16,54,62]. In particular, the orexigenic neuropeptide Y/Agouti-
related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons are activated in response to food
deprivation, while the anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-
expressing cells are inhibited [2,3,5,32,33,66]. In addition to contrib-
uting to energy balance, the activity of arcuate NPY/AgRP and POMC
neurons
also
have
profound
effects
on
glucose
metabolism
[18,31,50,56]. These changes in cellular activity have been attributed
to both native channel properties as well as (re)organization of synaptic
connectivity [18,24,25]. One fascinating characteristic of this circuit is
the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to arcuate NPY/
AgRP and POMC neurons has been shown to change in response to
metabolic hormones, such as leptin and ghrelin [13,14,49,59,63,65],
as well as alter body weight in response to energy intake or monogenic
obesity models [23e25,46,48,65]. These observations support a rapid
and constitutive plasticity of melanocortin synaptic organization which
responds and contributes to metabolic homeostasis [23]. The plasticity
of hypothalamic signaling has been studied in the context of obesity,
changing energy demands/availability and humoral cues however the
role of melanocortin-specific synaptic plasticity in response to exercise
remains undefined. In current study, the hypothesis that exercise
(single bout and chronic training) modulates the cellular activity of
arcuate POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons was tested using whole-cell
patch-clamp recordings in hypothalamic slices from transgenic
mice. Exercise-induced effects were assessed on intrinsic membrane

 properties and synaptic responses, including subsets of POMC and
NPY/AgRP neurons which are identified as leptin receptor expressing
or non-leptin receptor expressing.
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1. Animal care
Age (12e18 weeks) and bodyweight (25e30 g) matched male POMC-
hrGFP::LepR-cre::tdtomato
(PLT)
and
male
NPY-hrGFP::LepR-
cre::tdtomato (NLT) mice were used for all whole cell patch-clamp
recordings. These mice allow us to identify POMC or NPY neurons that
either do or do not express LepR. C57/B6 mice were used for food
intake studies. All mice were housed under standard laboratory con-
ditions (12 h on/off; lights on at 7:00 a.m.) and temperature-controlled
environment (22e24 �C). All mice were provided a Harlan Teklad 2016
chow diet and water ad libitum unless otherwise noted. All experi-
ments were performed in accordance with the guidelines established
by the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals, and approved by the University of Texas Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committee.
2.2. Exercise protocols
Age and bodyweight matched male mice were divided into 2 groups:
sedentary and exercise. Motorized treadmills (Exer-6; Columbus In-
struments, Columbus, OH) were used for exercise experiments. Food
was removed from all the mice before they were placed on the tread-
mills. The mice were coaxed to stay on the treadmill (sedentary group) or
continue running on the treadmill by means of an electric stimulus
(0.25 mA � 163 V and 1 Hz) generated by a shock grid present at the
treadmill base and by manually tapping their tails using a soft nylon bottle
brush, as needed to enable all the mice to complete the exercise bout.
2.2.1. Exercise groups
All mice were familiarized to the treadmills for 2 days prior to the
exercise bout [Prior day 1: 5 min rest on the treadmill followed by
5 min at the speed of 8 m/min and then for 5 min at the speed of 10 m/
min; Prior day 2: 5 min rest on the treadmill followed by 5 min at the
speed of 10 m/min and then for 5 min at the speed of 12 m/min [41].
2.2.1.1. 1 day exercise protocol. On Day 1, mice were subjected to a
high intensity interval exercise (HIIE) bout [21,41] to assess exercise-
induced changes in electrophysiological characteristics of NPY/AgRP
and POMC neurons. Mice were rested on the treadmill for 5 min prior
to performing the 1 h of exercise consisting of 3 � 20 min intervals
(5 min at the speed of 12 m/min, followed by 10 min at the speed of
17 m/min, and then 5 min at the speed of 22 m/min), without rest
between intervals. This protocol was chosen because all of the mice
were able to complete the entire exercise protocol, and this exercise
protocol can reduce food intake in wild type mice [41].
2.2.1.2. 5 day exercise protocol. On Day 1-Day 4, mice were rested
on the treadmill for 5 min prior to performing the 1 h of continuous
exercise (60 min at the speed of 15 m/min). On Day 5, mice were
subjected to a high intensity interval exercise (HIIE) bout.
2.2.1.3. 10 day exercise protocol. On Day 1-Day 5, mice were rested
on the treadmill for 5 min prior to performing the 1 h of continuous
exercise (60 min at the speed of 15 m/min). Mice were then rested in
their home cages on Day 6 and Day 7. On Day 8-Day 11, mice per-
formed 1 h continuous exercise. On Day 12, mice were subjected to a
high intensity interval exercise (HIIE) bout.
2.2.2. Sedentary group
All mice were placed on the treadmills with the same time of exercise
group, while the speed was 0 m/min.
Following the final exercise day (1, 5, and 10 days), mice were
immediately sacrificed, and the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus
was harvested for electrophysiology recording (See Figure S1).
2.3. Body-weight measurement
Body weights of all mice were measured on the first day before ex-
ercise and the last day after exercise.
2.4. Electrophysiology studies
2.4.1. Slice preparation
Brain slices were prepared from male mice (12e18 weeks-old) as
previously described. Briefly, male mice were deeply anesthetized with
i.p. injection of 7% chloral hydrate and transcardially perfused with a
modified ice-cold artificial CSF (ACSF) (described below). The mice
were then decapitated, and the entire brain was removed, and
immediately submerged in ice-cold, carbogen-saturated (95% O2 and
5% CO2) ACSF (126 mM NaCl, 2.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM
CaCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, and 5 mM glucose).
Coronal sections (250 mm) were cut with a Leica VT1000S Vibratome
and then incubated in oxygenated ACSF at room temperature for at
least 1 h before recording. The slices were bathed in oxygenated ACSF
(32 �Ce34 �C) at a flow rate of w2 ml/min. All electrophysiology
recordings were performed at room temperature.
2.4.2. Whole-cell recording
The pipette solution for whole-cell recording was modified to include
an intracellular dye (Alexa Fluor 350 hydrazide dye) for whole-cell
recording: 120 mM K-gluconate, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM
EGTA, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM MgATP, 0.03 mM Alexa
Fluor 350 hydrazide dye (pH 7.3). Epifluorescence was briefly used to
target fluorescent cells, at which time the light source was switched to
infrared differential interference contrast imaging to obtain the whole-
cell recording (Zeiss Axioskop FS2 Plus equipped with a fixed stage
and a QuantEM:512SC electron-multiplying charge-coupled device
camera). Electrophysiological signals were recorded using an Axopatch
700B amplifier (Molecular Devices); low-pass filtered at 2e5 kHz, and
analyzed offline on a PC with pCLAMP programs (Molecular Devices).
Membrane potential and firing rate were measured by whole-cell
current clamp recordings from POMC and NPY neurons in brain sli-
ces. Recording electrodes had resistances of 2.5e5 MU when filled
with the K-gluconate internal solution. Input resistance was assessed
by measuring voltage deflection at the end of the response to a
hyperpolarizing rectangular current pulse steps (500 ms of �10
to �50 pA).
Neurons were voltage-clamped at �70 mV (for excitatory postsynaptic
currents) and �15 mV (for inhibitory postsynaptic currents). Frequency
and peak amplitude were measured by using the Mini Analysis pro-
gram (Synaptosoft, Inc.).
2.5. Blood collection and assessment of plasma leptin levels
Blood samples were collected via tail using heparinized capillary tubes
immediately after HIIE for both the exercised and the time-matched
sedentary controls. The blood samples were immediately centrifuged
at 4 �C and 1500 g � 15 min, and plasma was stored at �80 �C until
analysis.
Plasma leptin concentrations were estimated using ELISA kits e
Catalog #22-LEPMS-E01 (ALPCO).

 2.6. Food intake measurement
2.6.1. Food-deprivation/exercise protocol
Mice were subjected to 1 day (single bout HIIE), 5 days, and 10 days of
exercise training. On the final day of exercise training, food intake was
assessed after a 6 h food restriction [41]. Specifically, food was
removed from all the mice at the start of the light cycle (7 AM) for a
duration of 6 h. On the final exercise day, a 1 h exercise bout was
performed in the 2 nd h of food restriction (“2ndh EX”). 24 h food intake
was then measured at the end of the 6 h food restriction.
2.6.2. No food-deprivation/exercise protocol
Ad-libitum fed mice were subjected to 1 day (single bout HIIE).
Immediately following exercise, food intake was measured over a 24 h
period.
2.7. Fiber photometry
2.7.1. Experimental model
Agrp-IRES-Cre (Jackson Labs 012899, Agrptm1(cre)Lowl/J) and Pomc1-
Cre (Jackson Labs 005965, POMCtg(Pomc1�Cre)16Lowl/J) were used for
experimentation. All mice were habituated to handling and experi-
mental conditions prior to experiments. All procedures were approved
by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
2.7.2. Viral injections and fiber optic implantation
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5e3%, Clipper, 0010250)
and pretreated with subcutaneous injections of ketoprofen (5 mg/kg,
Santa Cruz Animal Health, sc-363115Rx) and bupivacaine (2 mg/kg,
Moore Medical, 52683). Mice were placed into a stereotaxic apparatus
(Stoelting, 51725D) and viral injections were performed as previously
described [1,58]. Unilateral injections of the genetically encoded cal-
cium indicator GCaMP6s [AAV1.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 (titer:
4.216e13 GC/ml, Penn Vector Core) were performed in the arcuate
hypothalamic nucleus (ARC, 400 ml) according to the following co-
ordinates: 1.35 mm posterior to bregma, 0.25 mm lateral to midline,
and 6.15e6.3 mm ventral to skull. A ferrule-capped optical fiber
(400 mm core, NA 0.48, Doric, MF2.5, 400/430e0.48) was implanted
0.2 mm above the injection site and secured to the skull with
Metabond cement (Parkell, S380) and dental cement (Lang Dental
Manufacturing, Ortho-jet BCA Liquid, B1306 and Jet Tooth Shade
Powder, 143069). All mice were given at least 2 weeks for recovery
and viral expression before experiments were performed.
2.7.3. Dual-wavelength fiber photometry
Dual-wavelength fiber photometry (FP) was performed as we and
others have previously described [35,58]. Two excitation wavelengths
were used: 490 and 405 nm. 490 nm excites calcium-dependent
fluorescence from GCaMP6s protein, providing a measure of AgRP
or POMC neuron activity. 405 nm excites calcium-independent fluo-
rescence from GCaMP6s protein and serves as a control for movement
and bleaching artifacts. Excitation light intensities were modulated at
different frequencies (211 and 566 Hz for 490 and 405 nm, respec-
tively) to avoid contamination from overhead lights (120 Hz and har-
monics) and cross-talk between excitation lights. Excitation lights were
generated through fiber-coupled LEDs (Thorlabs, M470F3 for 490 nm
and M405F1 for 405 nm) and modulated by a real-time amplifier
(TuckereDavis Technology, RZ5P). GCaMP6s emission fluorescence
signals were collected through a patch cord, collimated, passed
through a GFP emission filter (Thorlabs, MF525-39), and focused onto
a femtowatt photoreceiver (Newport, Model 2151, gain set to AC LOW).
The emission lights were converted to electrical signals and
demodulated by the RZ5P real-time processor. The FP experiments
were controlled by Synapse software (TuckereDavis Technology).
2.7.4. Fiber photometry HIIE experiment
Ad libitum fed mice underwent the HIIE protocol as described above.
On the second session, mice were tethered to a patch fiber to habituate
to fiber photometry procedures. On test day, AgRP/POMC neuron ac-
tivity was recorded during and after HIIE. All mice completed at least
one running interval, and 7/13 mice completed all 3 intervals. AgRP/
POMC neuron activity was analyzed during the last 10 min of running
and for 10 min-post running.
2.8. Analysis and statistics
Results are reported as the mean � SEM unless indicated otherwise,
as indicated in each figure legend. Membrane potential values were
not compensated to account for junction potential (�8 mV). Statistical
analysis was carried out using Graph Pad Prism 7.0 software. Degrees
of freedom (DF) for t statistics are marked as t(DF). All data were
evaluated using a two-tailed Student’s t test or ANOVA where appro-
priate, with *p < 0.05 being considered significant. The number of
cells or mice studied for each group is shown in parentheses.
Fiber photometry data were exported from Synapse to MATLAB
(MathWorks) using a script provided by TuckereDavis Technology. The
490 and 405 nm signals were independently processed and normalized
to baseline signals to determine DF/F, where DF/F ¼ (F�Fpre-stimulus)/
Fpre-stimulus and Fpre-stimulus is the median of pre-stimulus signal (end of
running). Data were down-sampled to 1 Hz in MATLAB, and mean DF/F
was calculated by integrating DF/F over a period of time and then
dividing by the integration time.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Exercise effects on the membrane and synaptic properties of
arcuate NPY neurons
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made in 247 NPY-hrGFP
neurons throughout the rostroecaudal axis of the arcuate nucleus
from NPY-hrGFP:LepR-cre:tdtomato mice (Figure 1AeD; Figure S2). All
arcuate NPY neurons (regardless of leptin receptor expression) from
sedentary
mice
had
an
average
resting
membrane
potential
of �37.4 � 0.4 mV, a mean input resistance of 1.4 � 0.1 GU, and
overshooting action potentials (n ¼ 126; Figure 1EeH). When
compared to values obtained from NPY neurons of sedentary mice (1
day ¼ �36.6 � 0.9 mV, n ¼ 31; 5 day ¼ �37.7 � 0.6 mV, n ¼ 37;
10 day ¼ �37.6 � 0.6 mV, n ¼ 58; Figure 1F), NPY neurons from
exercised mice exhibited a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential
(1 day ¼ �40.7 � 0.7 mV, t(65) ¼ 3.654, p < 0.05, n ¼ 36; 5
day ¼ �42.6 � 0.6 mV, t(70) ¼ 5.55, p < 0.05, n ¼ 35; 10
day ¼ �43.7 � 0.6 mV, t(106) ¼ 6.866, p < 0.05,n ¼ 50; Figure 1F).
The hyperpolarized membrane potential observed in NPY neurons from
exercised mice was concomitant with decreased action potential fre-
quency and decreased input resistance (Figure 1GeH).
The frequency of spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents (sEPSCs) in
all NPY neurons (regardless of leptin receptor expression) from
sedentary mice was: 1 day ¼ 2.1 � 0.2 Hz, n ¼ 32; 5
day ¼ 2.3 � 0.2 Hz, n ¼ 33; 10 day ¼ 2.4 � 0.2 Hz, n ¼ 53
(Figure 2AeC). When compared to values obtained from NPY neurons
of sedentary mice, exercise decreased the frequency of sEPSCs to NPY
neurons (1 day ¼ 1.97 � 0.2 Hz, t (60) ¼ 1.657, p > 0.05, n ¼ 30; 5
day ¼ 1.9 � 0.1 Hz, t (51) ¼ 1.285, p > 0.05, n ¼ 20; 10

 day ¼ 1.3 � 0.1 Hz, t (101) ¼ 4.548, p < 0.05, n ¼ 50; Figure 2Ae
C), while the amplitude of sEPSCs remained unchanged (Figure 2D).
The frequency of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in
all NPY neurons (regardless of leptin receptor expression) from
sedentary mice was: 1 day ¼ 1.1 � 0.2 Hz, n ¼ 30; 5
day ¼ 1.0 � 0.1 Hz, n ¼ 37; 10 day ¼ 1.0 � 0.1 Hz, n ¼ 47
(Figure 2EeG). When compared to values obtained from NPY neurons
of sedentary mice, exercise increased frequency of sIPSCs to NPY
neurons (1 day ¼ 0.9 � 0.1 Hz, t (64) ¼ 0.7795, p > 0.05, n ¼ 36; 5
day ¼ 1.4 � 0.1 Hz, t (70) ¼ 3.033, p < 0.05, n ¼ 35; 10
day ¼ 1.5 � 0.1 Hz, t (94) ¼ 2.746, p < 0.05, n ¼ 49; Figure 2EeG),
while the amplitude of sIPSCs remained unchanged (Figure 2H).
Body weights were similar between sedentary and exercised NPY-
hrGFP:LepR-cre::tdtomato
mice
from
all
exercise
time
points
(Figure S3A).
3.2. Exercise effects on the membrane and synaptic properties of
arcuate POMC neurons
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made in 170 POMC neurons
throughout the rostroecaudal axis of the arcuate nucleus from POMC-
hrGFP::LepR-cre::tdtomato mice (Figure 3AeD; Figure S4). All arcuate
POMC neurons (regardless of leptin receptor expression) from
sedentary
mice
had
an
average
resting
membrane
potential
of �46.7 � 0.6 mV, a mean input resistance of 1.0 � 0.04GU, and
overshooting action potentials (n ¼ 76; Figure 3EeH). When compared
to values obtained from POMC neurons of sedentary mice (1
day ¼ �45.7 � 0.9 mV, n ¼ 20; 5 day ¼ �48.0 � 1.3 mV, n ¼ 25;
10 day ¼ �46.2 � 0.8, n ¼ 31; Figure 3F), POMC neurons from
exercised mice exhibited a depolarized resting membrane potential (1
day ¼ �42.0 � 0.9 mV, t(45) ¼ 2.921, p < 0.05, n ¼ 27; 5
day ¼ �42.5 � 0.8, t(57) ¼ 3.746, p < 0.05, n ¼ 34; 10
day ¼ �42.9 � 0.9, t (62) ¼ 2.768, p < 0.05, n ¼ 33; Figure 3F). The
depolarized membrane potential observed in POMC neurons from
exercised mice was associated with an increase in the action potential
frequency and decreased input resistance (Figure 3GeH).
The frequency of sEPSCs in all POMC neurons (regardless of leptin
receptor expression) from sedentary mice was: 1 day ¼ 1.6 � 0.3 Hz,
n ¼ 18; 5 day ¼ 1.7 � 0.27 Hz, n ¼ 25; 10 day ¼ 1.2 � 0.2 Hz,
n ¼ 29; (Figure 4AeC). When compared to values obtained from POMC
neurons of sedentary mice, exercise increased the frequency of sEPSCs
to POMC neurons (1 day ¼ 2.5 � 0.3 Hz, t (43) ¼ 2.093, p < 0.05,
n ¼ 27; 5 day ¼ 2.5 � 0.2 Hz, t (57) ¼ 2.551, p < 0.05, n ¼ 34; 10
day ¼ 2.5 � 0.3 Hz, t (55) ¼ 3.556, p < 0.05, n ¼ 28; Figure 4AeC),
while the amplitude of sEPSCs remained unchanged (Figure 4D).

 The frequency of sIPSCs in all POMC neurons (regardless of leptin
receptor expression) from sedentary mice was: 1 day ¼ 1.0 � 0.1 Hz,
n ¼ 19; 5 day ¼ 0.8 � 0.1 Hz, n ¼ 25; 10 day ¼ 0.9 � 0.1 Hz,
n ¼ 26 (Figure 4EeG). When compared to values obtained from POMC
neurons of sedentary mice, exercise mice showed the similar fre-
quency of sIPSCs to POMC neurons (1 day ¼ 1.2 � 0.1 Hz, t
(45) ¼ 1.406, p > 0.05, n ¼ 28; 5 day ¼ 0.9 � 0.1 Hz, t

of sIPSCs remained unchanged (Figure 4H).
Body weights were similar between sedentary and exercised POMC-

mice
from

(Figure S3B).
3.3. Exercise effects on calcium dynamics of NPY/AgRP and POMC
neurons
Whole-cell calcium dynamics of arcuate NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons
following a single bout of HIIE was measured using in-vivo fiber
photometry [1,35,58] (Figure 5A). A single bout of HIIE decreased
whole cell calcium levels in arcuate AgRP neurons and increased
calcium levels in arcuate POMC neurons (Figure 5BeD). These results
support an inhibition of AgRP neurons and excitation of POMC neurons
post-exercise. Importantly, the changes of calcium levels in AgRP and
POMC neurons are consistent with the changes in membrane potential
and synaptic activity observed in electrophysiological recordings.
Although these changes in membrane potential, synaptic properties, as
well as in-vivo calcium levels are from a distributed population of
neurons (Figures S2 and S4), these data support a decrease in
excitability of arcuate NPY/AgRP neurons concomitant with increased
excitability of POMC neurons in response to exercise.
3.4. Leptin receptor expressing POMC neurons are more
susceptible to the effects of exercise
Recent work suggests that leptin plays an important role in synaptic (re)
organization of POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons [49,59]. In order to
investigate the role of leptin receptor expression in the response to ex-
ercise, we took advantage of the ability to identify arcuate POMC or NPY
neurons that do not express LepRs (green only, Figure 6AeE; Figure
S5AeE) and POMC-hrGFP or NPY-hrGFP neurons which express
LepRs (green/red, Figure 6FeJ; Figure S5FeJ) in POMC-hrGFP::LepR-
cre::tdtomato and NPY-hrGFP::LepR-cre::tdtomato mice. We recently
reported that more than half of NPY neurons restricted to the arcuate
nucleus express LepRs [27]. Here, we show that 15.5% of arcuate leptin
receptor neurons express POMC and 36.7% of arcuate POMC neurons
express Leptin receptor (Table 1). Notably, exercise-induced changes in
membrane potential, input resistance, and spontaneous EPSC frequency
were observed within one day of exercise in POMC neurons which ex-
press leptin receptors (Figure 6KeP; Figure 7AeD). These effects per-
sisted throughout the 10 days of experiment. Leptin receptor expressing
POMC neurons also exhibited an increase in IPSC frequency and
amplitude after 10 days of exercise (for IPSC frequency: t (32) ¼ 3.222,
p < 0.05, n (sedentary) ¼ 18, n (exercise) ¼ 16; for IPSC amplitude: t
(32) ¼ 2.83, p < 0.05; n (sedentary) ¼ 18, n (exercise) ¼ 16;
Figure 7EeH). Opposite to the effects observed in POMC neurons, LepRs
expressing or not expressing NPY neurons exhibited similar responses to
exercise (Figure S5; Figure S6).

 3.5. Temporal variability in the duration of exercise effects on
POMC and NPY neurons
We next analyzed the effects of exercise on POMC and NPY neurons in
the immediate hours and/or days after a single bout of HIIE. Arcuate
POMC neurons that express leptin receptors remained activated (i.e.
depolarized membrane potential and increased EPSC frequency) for 2
days after a single bout of HIIE (Figure 8AeB). Interestingly, we
observed a hyperpolarization of POMC neurons which express leptin
receptors on the 4th day after a single bout of HIIE before returning to
baseline levels on the 5th day following HIIE (Figure 8A). In contrast,
the effects of exercise in arcuate NPY neurons returned to baseline
levels within 6 h after a single bout of HIIE (Figure 8CeD). Together,
these data highlight a temporal variability in the effects of exercise on
arcuate POMC and NPY neuronal activity.
3.6. High intensity interval exercise suppresses feeding in mice
Using a food deprivation/exercise protocol previously described [41],
food intake measurements were studied after 1 day (single bout HIIE),
5 days, and 10 days of exercise training. Mice exhibited a decrease of
food intake in the 6 h following high intensity interval exercise
(Figure S7A), which persisted for 24 h (Figure S7B). The effects on
feeding were comparable after 1 day (single bout HIIE), 5 days, and 10
days of exercise training.
Moreover, food intake was also suppressed after a single bout of HIIE,
independent of food restriction (Figure S7CeD). These data support a
correlative increase in melanocortin tone leading to suppression of
food intake after HIIE in rodents.
4. DISCUSSION
Exercise predominantly evoked an inhibitory effect on NPY-expressing
neurons while eliciting an overall excitatory effect in adjacent POMC-
expressing neurons. These effects, in combination with those from
previous work, support an exercise-dependent enhancement of the
melanocortin neural circuitry within the arcuate nucleus, which is
congruent with a negative energy balance and improved glucose
metabolism (summarized in Figure S8).
4.1. Membrane and synaptic effects of exercise on POMC and NPY
neurons
Arcuate POMC neurons were depolarized while adjacent NPY neurons
were hyperpolarized in response to a single bout of exercise. The
changes in membrane potential were accompanied by a decrease in
input resistance, which support an increased channel activity. These
results are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise alters the
membrane potential of both POMC and NPY neurons via activation of a

 resting conductance. Excitatory neurotransmission is mediated by
glutamatergic ionotropic AMPA (AMPARs) and NMDA receptors
(NMDARs) while the inhibitory neurotransmission is mediated by
presynaptic GABAergic neurons. Glutamate and GABA are released
subsequent to activation of respective neurons within the hypothala-
mus [33,36,57], and also likely arising from nuclei elsewhere in the
brain [19,53,61]. Our results indicate exercise increased the frequency
of spontaneous EPSCs onto POMC neurons, while suppressing the
frequency of spontaneous EPSCs and increasing the frequency of
spontaneous IPSCs onto NPY neurons. Moreover, whole cell calcium
levels decreased in arcuate AgRP neurons while being increased in
arcuate POMC neurons after a single bout of HIIE, consistent with the
changes that we observed in the membrane potential of NPY and
POMC neurons previously. Therefore, exercise increases melanocortin
tone within the arcuate nucleus via pre- and post-synaptic activities.
Increased melanocortin signaling consistently results in improved
energy balance and glucose homeostasis [13,18,48,56]. In contrast,
increased activity of NPY/AgRP neurons results in impaired energy
balance and glucose metabolism [2,32,56]. In the current study, the
activity profile exhibited by arcuate POMC and NPY/AgRP neurons in
response to exercise is in accordance with improved energy balance
and glucose metabolism. While the effects of exercise on feeding
behavior have been controversial, recent evidence suggests that ex-
ercise, including high intensity exercise, can result in decreased food
intake in the immediate hours after exercise [41,55]. Similarly, acute
bouts of exercise can result in significant improvements in peripheral
insulin sensitivity and hepatic glucose production [8,10,22,60,64].
While currently unclear, the activity profile exhibited by NPY/AgRP and
POMC neurons could possibly serve as a cellular correlate for these
exercise-induced changes in metabolic physiology.
4.2. Synchronicity of exercise effects on cellular and synaptic
activity in NPY/AgRP and POMC neurons
Another salient finding is that the duration of the exercise effects on the
cellular and synaptic activity of melanocortin neurons is restricted to a
variable temporal window. Single bouts of exercise have been shown to
alter plasma hormone levels [22,41,47,60], promote motor learning
[40,52], and induce neuroplasticity leading to improved cognitive
function [26,40,42]. While single bouts of exercise can result in im-
provements of glucose metabolism, exercise training consistently re-
sults
in
enhanced
effects
on
the
regulation
of
metabolism
[9,17,20,22,30,45,60]. Notably, we examined the exercise-induced
time dependent changes in POMC and NPY neuronal characteristics.
When compared to POMC neurons from sedentary mice, POMC neurons
exhibited a depolarized membrane potential and increased frequency of
spontaneous EPSCs after a single bout of exercise. These effects
persisted and were enhanced throughout exercise training. Additionally,
exercise training (5 and 10 days) led to additive effects on action po-
tential frequency and input resistance. These data suggest that the
rapid depolarization of POMC neurons after an acute bout of exercise
may better correlate with increased excitatory synaptic inputs, rather
than a change in post-synaptic ionic conductance or channel state. The
activation of a putative conductance subsequent to exercise training
may help to reinforce the effects of exercise to activate POMC neurons.
After a single bout of exercise, NPY neurons exhibited a hyperpolarized
membrane potential and decreased input resistance when compared to
NPY neurons from sedentary mice. Similar to POMC neurons, these
effects persisted and were enhanced throughout exercise training. The
hyperpolarized membrane potential was accompanied by an increasing
suppression of action potential frequency with additional exercise
training. Interestingly, while NPY neurons were hyperpolarized, the
synaptic activities onto NPY neurons were unaffected after an acute
bout of exercise. The frequencies of spontaneous IPSCs were increased
while spontaneous EPSC frequency decreased after 5 or 10 days of
exercise training, respectively. The asynchronous changes in mem-
brane potential and synaptic activity suggest that the hyperpolarized
membrane potential of NPY neurons better correlates with changes of
post-synaptic ionic conductance or channel state, rather than changes
of synaptic activity. These data suggest the possibility of multiple
mechanisms being involved in the remodeling of synaptic and cellular
properties of NPY and POMC neurons in response to exercise. These
data also support the idea that repeated bouts of exercise occurring
during training may reinforce the remodeling of this neural circuit.
4.3. Leptin receptor dependent plasticity of arcuate POMC neurons
in responses to exercise
Recent work has highlighted a plastic property of NPY/AgRP and POMC
neuronal circuitry [36,49,59,65]. Moreover, the plasticity of this circuit
has been suggested to be highly sensitive to the levels of leptin
[49,59]. In particular, genetic models of leptin deficiency results in
increased excitatory tone to NPY/AgRP neurons and increased inhibi-
tory tone to POMC neurons [49,59]. Similarly, fasting, which results in
a fall of leptin levels, increased NPY/AgRP and decreased POMC
neuronal activity [24,36,59,65]. In order to better examine the role of
leptin receptors in the exercise-induced plasticity of POMC and NPY
neurons, we utilized a mouse model where we identified POMC and
NPY neurons that express or do not express leptin receptors. Impor-
tantly, we found that the exercise-induced changes in cellular and
synaptic properties of POMC neurons were enriched in POMC neurons
that express leptin receptors. In particular, the increase in action po-
tential frequency was concomitant with the depolarized membrane
potential and increased EPSC frequency after a single bout of exercise.
A similar rapid decrease of input resistance was observed in LepR
positive POMC neurons after acute exercise. Importantly, all changes in
cellular and synaptic properties of LepR positive POMC neurons per-
sisted and were enhanced throughout exercise training. Contrary to the
effects observed in LepR positive POMC neurons, LepR negative POMC
neurons failed to incite similar changes. It should be noted that while
the changes in LepR negative POMC neurons were not significant,
these neurons trended toward an overall excitation during continued
exercise training observed via changes of membrane potential, action
potential frequency, and spontaneous EPSC frequency. These data
Table 1 e Table shows the distribution of arcuate POMC neurons that
express or do not express leptin receptors in POMC-hrGFP::LepR-
icre::tdtomato mice. These data were studied from five male POMC-
hrGFP::LepR-icre::tdtomato mice.

 highlight a novel and selective exercise-induced regulation in a sub-
population of arcuate POMC neurons that express leptin receptors;
however, NPY neurons that express or do not express leptin receptors
exhibited similar responses to exercise.
While leptin via leptin receptors may contribute to the exercise-induced
effects on cellular activity in the current study, multiple nutrient sensing
and peptidergic systems are also altered in response to exercise. Many
of these systems have trophic properties and contribute to synaptic
plasticity within the brain. While currently unclear, it is also possible that
the leptin receptor expressing POMC neurons select for one of these
mechanisms. This warrants future investigation. Moreover, previous
models of leptin deficiency as well as observations in fasting conditions
depict a cellular reorganization of the melanocortin circuit in response to
perceived energy deprivation. In the current study we show that NPY/
AgRP neurons are inhibited and POMC neurons are excited in response
to exercise. Thus, exercise appears to be a metabolic challenge that is
unique from energy deprivation, and the remodeling of this circuit is a
specific response of exercise to improve metabolism.
4.4. Temporal variability in the duration of exercise effects on
POMC and NPY neurons
Another interesting observation is that a single bout of exercise is
sufficient to remodel the NPY or leptin expressing POMC neurons in
the melanocortin circuit for hours to days. Synaptic plasticity occurs
in multiple areas of the brain [12,29,36,39]. While early reports of
synaptic plasticity were characterized in classical components of
cognitive learning and memory [4,6,37,38], recent evidence sug-
gests that cellular plasticity may occur in response to various
challenges (including changing metabolic states) [23,36,49,59]. In
the current study, we postulate that the plasticity of the melano-
cortin circuit observed in response to exercise might be an analo-
gous representation to learning and memory paradigms. However,
in-lieu of altered cognition the melanocortin circuit is rewired into
a circuit, which is beneficial for metabolic regulation creating a
representation of a new metabolic “set point” [28,34,44,51]. Also, it
is notable that the persistence of these effects is transiently regu-
lated on different time scales. In particular, the exercise induced
excitation of POMC neurons which express leptin receptors persisted
for 2 days after a single bout of exercise, while the inhibitory effects
on NPY neurons reversed within hours. It should be noted that the
timeline of events described in the current study are analogous to
reports that acute bouts of exercise in humans can improve insulin
sensitivity for up to 48 h [43]. Together, it is possible that the
cellular rearrangement of the melanocortin circuit is at least in
part a cellular correlate (cellular mechanism) to these earlier
observations.

 5. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, a single bout of exercise activated arcuate POMC neurons
while inhibiting arcuate NPY neurons. Repeated bouts of exercise
enhanced the respective activities of NPY and POMC neurons. These
changes in activity were dependent upon temporally regulated alter-
ations of both pre and post synaptic responses. Moreover, the acti-
vation of POMC neurons was predicated on the presence of leptin
receptors, but not in NPY neurons. Together these data highlight
multiple mechanisms in the remodeling of synaptic and cellular
properties of NPY and POMC neurons in response to exercise. Alto-
gether, providing a putative cellular mechanism by which exercise may
improve metabolism via activity of melanocortin neurons.
