IMPORTANCE Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness in adults of working
age in the United States. In the Los Angeles County safety net, a nonvertically integrated
system serving underinsured and uninsured patients, the prevalence of DR is approximately
50%, and owing to limited specialty care resources, the average wait times for screening for
DR have been 8 months or more.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether a primary care–based teleretinal DR screening (TDRS)
program reduces wait times for screening and improves timeliness of needed care in the
Los Angeles County safety net.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest evaluation of
exposure to primary care–based TDRS at 5 of 15 Los Angeles County Department of Health
Services safety net clinics from September 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015, with a subgroup
analysis of random samples of 600 patients before and after the intervention (1200 total).
EXPOSURE Primary care clinic–based teleretinal screening for DR.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual rates of screening for DR before and after
implementation of the TDRS program across the 5 clinics, time to screening for DR in a
random sample of patients from these clinics, and a description of the larger framework of
program implementation.
RESULTS Among the 21 222 patients who underwent the screening (12 790 female, 8084
male, and 348 other gender or not specified; mean [SD] age, 57.4 [9.6] years), the median
time to screening for DR decreased from 158 days (interquartile range, 68-324 days) before
the intervention to 17 days (interquartile range, 8-50 days) after initiation of the program
(P < .001). Overall annual screening rates for DR increased from 5942 of 14 633 patients
(40.6%) before implementation to 7470 of 13 133 patients (56.9%) after initiation of the
program at all 15 targeted clinics (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9; P = .002). Of the 21 222
patients who were screened, 14 595 (68.8%) did not require referral to an eye care
professional, 4160 (19.6%) were referred for treatment or monitoring of DR, and 2461 (11.6%)
were referred for other ophthalmologic conditions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A digital TDRS program was successfully implemented for the
largest publicly operated county safety net population in the United States, resulting in the
elimination of the need for more than 14 000 visits to specialty care professionals, a 16.3%
increase in annual rates of screening for DR, and an 89.2% reduction in wait times for
screening. Teleretinal DR screening programs have the potential to maximize access and
efficiency in the safety net, where the need for such programs is most critical.

D
iabetic retinopathy (DR) affects more than 5.3 mil-
lion Americans and is the leading cause of blindness
among adults of working age.1 Among Latinos in Los
Angeles, California—the ethnic majority in the Los Angeles
County safety net—the prevalence of DR among those with
diabetes is approximately 50%.2 Although early detection
and treatment can prevent blindness from DR,3 many per-
sons with diabetes fail to receive appropriate screening
examinations and/or sight-saving treatments.4,5 On average,
only 60% of patients with diabetes in the United States
receive recommended annual eye examinations; in safety
net populations, these rates have been shown to be less
than 25%.6,7
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services
(LAC DHS) is the largest publicly operated county safety
net health care system in the United States, serving more
than 800 000 patients annually. The LAC DHS safety net
is a nonvertically integrated system serving underinsured
and uninsured patients, charged with providing high-
quality primary and specialty care despite substantial
financial and social barriers.8 Timely access to specialty
services in this underresourced, high-need setting
has been an ongoing challenge, especially for eye
care, with more than 200 primary care clinics referring
patients to 6 optometry and 4 ophthalmology clinics.
The increasing prevalence of diabetes during the past
2 decades9 has worsened this issue. Historically, wait
times for retinal examinations for patients with newly
diagnosed diabetes within the LAC DHS have been 8 months
or more.
To address this need, we implemented a county-wide,
primary care–based teleretinal DR screening (TDRS) pro-
gram starting in September 2013. Primary care–based TDRS
has been proven to be accurate (sensitivity, >80%; specific-
ity, >90%)10 compared with the criterion standard for DR
screening, 7 standard-field 35-mm Early Treatment of Dia-
betic Retinopathy Study protocol fundus photographs, and
the clinical care standard of direct ophthalmoscopic exami-
nation by an eye care professional.11-13 Teleretinal DR
screening is well suited to solve the problems of the safety
net because it increases access by screening through pri-
mary care rather than specialty care, improves efficiency by
moving patients with normal retinal photographs out of the
queue for appointments with specialty care professionals,
and reduces wait times for those with treatable disease. The
Veterans Health Administration and the Indian Health Ser-
vice, among others, have implemented successful TDRS
programs,14-17 but primary care–based TDRS has never been
implemented to scale in as large a US safety net system as
the LAC DHS.
We describe the successful implementation of a primary
care–based TDRS program in the LAC DHS. During imple-
mentation, we conducted a quasi-experimental pretest-
posttest evaluation to determine whether TDRS decreased
wait times for screening for DR and improved screening
rates. Our paradigm for implementation is a model for other
urban safety net populations where the need for such pro-
grams is arguably the greatest.
Methods
TDRS Program Implementation
Patient Care Setting
The LAC DHS had a total of 571 964 unique primary care visits
in 2014 and 2015, caring for 64 826 persons with diabetes. His-
torically, the LAC DHS has had a fragmented specialty care de-
livery system, with 4 hospitals (with different academic uni-
versity affiliations), 2 multiservice ambulatory care centers,
6 comprehensive health centers, and multiple primary care
clinics operating in urban and rural geographic clusters, mak-
ing systemwide clinical collaboration and standardization of
processes challenging. In addition, the LAC DHS receives re-
ferrals for specialty care from more than 200 community part-
ner clinic sites throughout LAC. This scenario creates a formi-
dableenvironmentfortheprovisionofeyecareservices:ahigh
volume of patients and a limited amount of eye care profes-
sionals spread throughout a large geographical area, ranging
from urban to rural, in diverse practice settings with varied on-
site access to specialists.
TDRS Program Clinical Pathways and Protocols
To improve access to DR screening, we implemented a TDRS
program throughout 15 of the largest LAC DHS–operated pri-
mary care clinics. Our first clinic began screening in Septem-
ber 2013, followed by rolling expansion to all LAC DHS com-
prehensive health center primary care clinics, medical center
primary care clinics, and multispecialty ambulatory care cen-
ter primary care clinics by March 2015.
As of December 2015, a total of 58 certified medical assis-
tants and licensed vocational nurses were trained and certi-
fied as fundus photographers. We trained existing certified
medical assistants to use the cameras in primary care set-
tings and to upload these digital images via our web-based
screening software (EyePACS software; EyePACS LLC). We cre-
ated a retinal photography clinic for which patients are sched-
uled in advance by their primary care professional or a care
manager. This method best uses the photographers’ time be-
cause they often perform other services, and it also allowed
Key Points
Question What is the effect of a primary care–based teleretinal
diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening program on rates of screening
for DR and wait times for screening in a large safety net health care
system?
Findings In this quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest evaluation
of a teleretinal DR screening program in the Los Angeles County
Department of Health Services, the need for more than 14 000
visits to specialty care professionals was eliminated, annual rates
of screening for DR increased by 16.3%, and wait times for
screening were reduced by 89.2%.
Meaning With standardization and oversight, primary care–based
teleretinal DR screening programs have the potential to maximize
access and efficiency in the safety net, where the need for such
programs is most critical.

allows for submission of screening results and subsequent
scheduling of follow-up across the LAC DHS. Based on the re-
sults of screening, patients may be triaged into either optom-
etry clinics for early levels of DR or ophthalmology clinics for
more severe DR. For further description of the clinical path-
way and program implementation strategies, please see the

Population for Description of TDRS Program Implementation
Patients were included in the overall description of the TDRS
program implementation if they received a diagnosis of dia-
betes and received primary care–based teleretinal screening
from September 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015. Eligibility for
TDRS required that patients have no acute vision loss or ma-
jor eye symptoms, that they be able to sit up and remain still
for retinal photography, and that they not be actively cared for
by any eye care professional within or outside the LAC DHS
during the last 12 months.
TDRS Program Evaluation
Study Design
Weconductedaretrospective,repeatedcross-sectionalpretest-
posttest evaluation using historical controls with exposure to
primary care–based TDRS at the clinic level to evaluate the ef-
fect of TDRS on the proportion of patients with diabetes re-
ceiving retinal screening and the wait time for screening.
Population for Evaluation of the TDRS Program
WeevaluatedtheeffectoftheTDRSprograminasubsetof5DHS-
operated clinics of the 15 total in which the program was imple-
mented. To evaluate rates of screening for DR, we determined
aggregateproportionsofpatientswithdiabetesscreenedacross

using encounter data. To evaluate time to screening, we mea-
suredtimetoscreeningamongarandomsampleof120patients
from each of the 5 clinics in both the preintervention (n = 600)
and postintervention (n = 600) periods. The 5 clinics were se-
lectedforthisevaluationbasedonpatientvolume,adequatestaff
for photography training, and appropriate space to place a fun-
dus camera in the primary care clinic. The clinics were of simi-
larsize,patientpopulation,andequalscopeofcare.Patientswere
included in the evaluation if they were 18 years of age or older,
received a diagnosis of diabetes by a medical professional, and
were active patients of the clinic (defined as having had ≥2 rou-
tine visits with a primary care professional at one of the desig-
natedstudyclinicsinthepast12months).Patientswereexcluded
if they received regular care by an eye care clinician during the
past12months.Approval,includingawaiverofpatientconsent,
wasobtainedfromtheinstitutionalreviewboardsofUniversity
of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), University of Southern Cali-
fornia, and the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at
Harbor-UCLA.
Data Collection
Demographic and clinical characteristics were abstracted from
themedicalrecord,includingdatesofreferralforretinalscreen-
ing and the date the screening was performed. A 12-month pe-
riod from December 1, 2011, to November 30, 2012, was used
for the preintervention period. Identical information was col-
lected during the postintervention phase using a 12-month pe-
riod after the TDRS program was fully implemented at these
5 practices, from September 1, 2014, to August 31, 2015.
Main Outcomes
Screening Rates
Encounter and claims data were used to estimate the propor-
tion of patients with diabetes seen in each primary care clinic
and the number of patients who were screened for DR in the
12-month preintervention and postintervention periods. Ag-
gregateratesofscreeningwerecalculatedusingthesamemeth-
ods in the preintervention and postintervention periods.
Screening Wait Times
In the preintervention and postintervention periods, the num-
ber of patients with diabetes receiving ophthalmology and op-
tometry care was determined by obtaining information on pa-
tients referred to the LAC DHS eye clinics via record review and
linkage of identifiers with medical records from the eye clin-
ics. The wait time from referral to screening and the 95% CIs
around this time estimate for preintervention and postinter-
vention groups were calculated.

Statistical Analysis
Summary statistics, including mean (SD) values, median val-
ues, interquartile ranges, and frequency distributions, were
generated to characterize the study population. A general-
ized estimating equation logistic regression model was used
to analyze the correlated repeated measures of clinics and to
provide a population mean comparison for the preinterven-
tion and postintervention annual rates of screening. A non-
parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare me-
dian time to screening between the preintervention and
postinterventiongroups.Alltestswere2-sided,andP < .05was
considered statistically significant.
With 120 individuals from each of 5 primary care clinics
forbothpreinterventionandpostinterventionpopulations,our
study was powered to detect a 15% change in wait times to
screening for DR. For our evaluation, if a patient chosen ran-
domly to be part of the postintervention group was included
in the preintervention group, he or she was excluded from the
postintervention sample.
Results
Program Implementation
As of December 31, 2015, a total of 21 222 patients underwent
screening for DR. The characteristics and disease severity of
our screened population are reported in Table 1. Of the 21 222
screened, 14 595 (68.8%) did not need a referral to an eye care
professional because they had normal screening photo-
graphs or only mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR); both condi-
tions require only repeating fundus photographs annually. Of
the 6627 patients (31.2%) who did need referral, 4160 (19.6%)
were referred for DR (moderate NPDR, severe NPDR, and pro-
liferative DR, as well as clinically significant macular edema),
while 2461 (11.6%) were referred for other conditions, includ-
ing ungradable photographs owing to the presence of cata-
racts and/or other eye problems (1040 [4.9%]).
Pretest-Posttest Evaluation
The characteristics of participants in the pretest and posttest
samples are found in Table 2. Overall annual screening rates
for DR improved from 5942 of 14 633 patients (40.6%) before
implementationofTDRS(fiscalyear2011-2012)to7470of13 133
patients (56.9%) after the intervention (fiscal year 2014-
2015) (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9; P = .002) (Table 3). The
Figuredepictsacomparisonofunadjustedscreeningratesover
time at each of the 5 clinics before and after initiation of the
TDRS program. The median time to screening for DR de-
creased from 158 days (interquartile range, 68-324 days) be-
fore the intervention to 17 days (interquartile range, 8-50 days)
after the intervention (P < .001) (Table 4).
Discussion
This study demonstrates a successful, sustainable implemen-
tationofaTDRSprograminthelargestpubliclyoperatedcounty
safety net public health system in the United States. By em-
bedding our program in primary care clinics and using certi-
fied medical assistants to take the fundus photographs and
electronically transmit them to a reading center staffed by cur-
rent LAC DHS optometrists, we were able to substantially im-
proveboththedetectionofDRandtheuseofspecialtyeyecare
resources,resultingintheeliminationoftheneedformorethan
14 000 visits to specialty care professionals, a 16.3% increase
in annual rates of screening, and an 89.2% reduction in wait
times for screening.
Our results confirm findings from a smaller pilot study of
6 federally qualified health centers in the LAC DHS health care
system showing that 1697 of 2732 patients (62.1%) screened
had normal examination results and could be removed from
the queue for ophthalmology appointments.20 Of the 1035 pa-
tients (37.9%) who were referred for specialty eye care, 507
(18.6%) were referred for DR, 260 (9.5%) of whom needed pos-
sibletreatmentandwereflaggedforexpeditedreferral.Clearly,
TDRShasthepotentialtoeliminatetheneedforaseparatevisit
to an ophthalmologist for patients with minimal disease and
to expedite treatment for those needing urgent ophthalmic at-
tention. Although TDRS programs have been successfully
implemented in other care settings, the LAC DHS is an ex-
ampleofaheterogeneous,nonverticallyintegratedsystemthat
is well suited to benefit from TDRS owing to its limited spe-
cialty resources and large burden of disease.
Numerous analyses have detailed the large cost benefit of
programs aimed at increasing DR screening.21,22 There is also

a significant body of literature examining the cost-
effectiveness of TDRS compared with conventional retinal
examination in rural, urban, community, academic, and in-
ternational settings.23-25 With strategic planning and work-
flow implementation, TDRS is a potential cost-efficient alter-
native that can improve convenience and access to retinal
screening across different practice settings, including that of
county facilities.26
A key to the sustainability of our program is the integration
ofDRscreeningintoprimarycarepractices,treatingitasadiag-
nostic test to establish a need for referral to specialty eye care.
Byeliminatingtheneedforaseparatevisittoaspecialist,weare
abletoincreasethenumberofpatientsscreenedforDRwithout
increasing demand on specialty care, which is critical in a sys-
tem in which more than 3000 people are currently waiting for
eye care appointments. Most patients do not need to see an eye
careprofessional,andremovingthemfromthequeuedecreases
thebacklogofpatientswaitingforeyecareappointmentsandal-
lows for better use of patients’ limited resources (eg, transpor-
tation and time off work). When the LAC DHS TDRS program is
fully operational, we will provide capacity for screening all pa-
tients with diabetes in the DHS primary care clinics (approxi-
mately 65 000 patients per year).
Implementation of telemedicine initiatives can be chal-
lenging in any health care system, and the barriers may be
greater in underresourced safety net or public health sys-
tems. First, among non–eye care specialists, there is skepti-
cism that TDRS can be as accurate and effective as an in-
person examination with an eye care professional, despite a
large body of supportive literature.10-12 In addition to strate-
gicplanningandstandardization,educationofallcriticalstake-
holders and support of hospital, clinic, and health system lead-
ership are essential. A second barrier comes from within the
specialtycarecommunity:eyecareprofessionalsfearthatTDRS
programs will decrease referrals for in-clinic visits. However,
eye care professionals need to understand that improved rates
of screening for DR and triage actually result in increased de-
tection of patients with significant disease and therefore in-
creased referrals of patients needing higher-level care.27,28 In
the safety net, this allows us to better match a health care pro-
fessional’s skill set with the care he or she is providing, which
is necessary to improve access and minimize cost. Lastly, criti-
cal to the implementation of this TDRS program has been ad-
dressing barriers to telemedicine, creating a framework for the
future provision of teleophthalmologic care beyond screen-
ing for DR.
Limitations
Our analysis is subject to some limitations affecting general-
izability. First, the effect of our intervention may be dimin-
ished because postintervention data were collected during the
program ramp-up period, while workflows were still being ad-
justed.Second,duringtheprogramrollout,theLACDHSimple-
mented a new electronic medical record system, which may
have resulted in underreporting of rates of screening for DR
in the period after implementation owing to improper cod-
ing.Third,implementationofourprogramwasconcurrentwith
California’s expansion of Medicaid and changes in govern-
ment policies around the Affordable Care Act. The enroll-
ment of our patient population into new health care plans
caused continual shifts in clinical patient panels as we cre-
ated patient-centered medical homes and strove to meet new

mandates. Wait times for screening and clinic visits may have
beenlengthenedasourpatientpopulationmorefrequentlyen-
rolled (and de-enrolled) in insurance programs. However, as
transient patient populations are typical of the US safety net
and seen in both preintervention and postintervention popu-
lations, the effects of this are likely minimal. Fourth, we can-
not account for patients who received eye care outside of the
LAC DHS, which may affect our rates of screening before and
after the intervention. However, rates of outside care should
be similar before and after the intervention and, therefore,
should not affect changes in screening rates. Fifth, given the
highcostanddifficultyoffindingwell-matchedcontrolswithin
the geographically and demographically heterogeneous pri-
mary care practices of the LAC health care system, controls
were historical, with the selected clinics acting as their own
controls. Although it is possible that factors in addition to our
intervention affected rates of screening for DR, the magni-
tude and uniformity of the change we observed suggests that
our findings are unlikely to be attributable to secular trends
over time. Lastly, although our TDRS program substantially re-
duced wait times to screening and improved rates of screen-
ing, more information is needed to demonstrate that patients
who need treatment are actually receiving this care in an ex-
pedited fashion.
Conclusions
We showed that TDRS can be executed on a large scale in a
heterogeneous, nonvertically integrated health care environ-
ment and can result in substantial improvements in both ef-
ficiency and quality of care. The safety net is ideal for tele-
health interventions owing to limited resources and high
disease burden; these interventions allow for health care pro-
fessionals to work at the top of their skill set, which in turn in-
creases access to care. We believe that the US safety net would
be wise to invest in telehealth programs such as this one to ad-
dress critical needs regarding access to care.

Invited Commentary
Seeing the Effect of Health Care Delivery Innovation
in the Safety Net
Courtney Lyles, PhD; Urmimala Sarkar, MD, MPH
The article by Daskivich et al1 in this issue of JAMA Internal
Medicine evaluates a large-scale telemedicine diabetic reti-
nopathy(DR)screeningprogramintheLosAngelesCountyDe-
partmentofHealthServices,oneofthelargestsafetynethealth
care systems in the United States. This widespread screening
program used existing primary care workflows to train medi-
cal assistants and licensed vocational nurses to be the certi-
fied fundus photographers and then sent the digital images to
staff optometrists to grade levels of DR and determine timing
of follow-up appointments for appropriate specialty care.
Improving screening of DR is a key public health priority,
giventhatdiabetesistheleadingcauseofpreventableblindness
in the United States. Safety net health systems have tradition-
allyfacedchallengesconductingrecommendedannualscreen-
ing for DR because of the high
prevalence of patients with
diabetes combined with the
lack of access to optometrists
andophthalmologists.Theau-
thors review both the overall
