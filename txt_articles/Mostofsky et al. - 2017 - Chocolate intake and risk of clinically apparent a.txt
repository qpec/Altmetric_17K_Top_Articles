ABSTRACT
Objective To evaluate the association between
chocolate intake and incident clinically apparent atrial
fibrillation or flutter (AF).
Methods The Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study is
a large population-based prospective cohort study. The
present study is based on 55 502 participants (26 400
men and 29 102 women) aged 50–64 years who had
provided information on chocolate intake at baseline.
Incident cases of AF were ascertained by linkage with
nationwide registries.
Results During a median of 13.5 years there were
3346 cases of AF. Compared with chocolate intake less
than once per month, the rate of AF was lower for
people consuming 1–3 servings/month (hazard ratio (HR)
0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 0.98), 1
serving/week (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.92), 2–6
servings/week (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.91) and ≥1
servings/day (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; p-linear
trend <0.0001), with similar results for men and
women.
Conclusions Accumulating evidence indicates that
moderate chocolate intake may be inversely associated
with AF risk, although residual confounding cannot be
ruled out.
INTRODUCTION
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhyth-
mia in clinical practice, affecting 2.7–6.1 million
people in the USA and 8.8 million in the European
Union.1 AF is associated with a higher risk of
stroke, heart failure, cognitive decline, dementia
and mortality,2 so identifying methods for prevent-
ing and identifying effective treatments for AF is of
great public health importance.
Moderate consumption of cocoa and cocoa-
containing
foods
may
promote
cardiovascular
health due to their high content of flavanols, a
subgroup of polyphenols with vasodilatory, anti-
oxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.3 4 There
has been extensive research showing that moderate
consumption of chocolate, particularly dark choc-
olate, improves markers of cardiovascular health5
and is associated with a lower rate of myocardial
infarction,6 heart failure,7 8 composite cardiovas-
cular adverse outcome and cardiovascular mortal-
ity.9
However,
there
is
limited
research
on
whether chocolate intake is associated with a
lower rate of AF.
Recent evidence suggests that the pathophysi-
ology of AF involves an inflammatory cascade
resulting in a release of cytokines, reactive oxygen
species and stimulation of fibroblast proliferation,
differentiation and activation.10 Higher levels of
inflammation may result in endothelial damage,
increased platelet activation and increased expres-
sion of fibrinogen that leads to electrical and struc-
tural
remodelling
of
atrial
tissue
and
thereby
increase AF risk.11 Therefore, we hypothesised that
the anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet benefits of
cocoa may be associated with a lower rate of AF.
W
e aimed to evaluate whether there is an associ-
ation between chocolate intake and the rate of clin-
ically apparent AF after adjusting for relevant
confounders in a large prospective cohort study of
men and women enrolled in the Danish Diet,
Cancer, and Health Study.
METHODS
Study population
Between December 1993 and May 1997, the pro-
spective Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study
invited
160 725
individuals
to
participate.
Inclusion criteria were 50–64 years of age, resi-
dence in the greater Copenhagen or Aarhus area
and no previous cancer diagnosis in the Danish
National Patient Register. At enrolment, anthropo-
metric measurements were taken and biological
materials
were
collected
at
one
of
the
study
centres; information on diet and lifestyle was
obtained
using
self-administered
questionnaires
including a semiquantitative food frequency ques-
tionnaire (FFQ). Using the unique personal identifi-
cation
number
(CPR
number),
we
linked
the
cohort to the Danish National Patient Register to
identify primary discharge diagnoses for AF or
flutter
(International
Classification
of
Diseases,
10th Revision: I48) through December 2009. The
study
was
approved
by
the
regional
Ethical
Committees on Human Studies ( jr.nr. (KF) 11–
037/01)
and
( jr.nr.
(KF)
01–045/93)
and
the
Danish Data Protection Agency. All participants
gave verbal and written informed consent.
Chocolate intake
At baseline, participants completed a 192-item
FFQ that was validated against two 7-day weighed
diet records.12 13 Average intake of each food item
during the last 12 months was reported in 10 cat-
egories from ‘never’ to ‘4–5 per day’. For each

 participant, average daily intake was calculated using the Food
Calc software V
.1.3 (J Lauritsen, University of Copenhagen;
http://www.ibt.ku.dk/jesper/foodcalc/). Standard recipes and sex-
specific portion sizes were applied to calculate intake in grams
per day by using data from the 1995 Danish National Dietary
Survey, 24-hour diet recall interviews from 3818 of the study
participants14 and several cookbooks. A serving of chocolate
was defined as 1 ounce, consistent with the results of a valid-
ation study15 that showed that the approximate serving size of
chocolate in Swedish men is 30 g chocolate. The questionnaire
did not differentiate between milk and dark chocolate, but most
chocolate consumed in Denmark has a minimum of 30% cocoa
solids.16
Atrial fibrillation
All citizens of Denmark have a unique personal identification
number that is used in all national registries, and updated infor-
mation is available on emigration, hospitalisations and death.
The Danish National Patient Register includes discharge diagno-
ses from in-hospital patients since 1977 and additional dis-
charge diagnoses from emergency rooms and outpatient visits
since 1995.
The outcome in this study was incident clinically apparent AF
and/or atrial flutter (AFL) during the study period. Diagnoses
were recorded using the Eighth International Classification of
Diseases (ICD-8) until the end of 1993 (AF (427.93) and AFL
(427.94) in the Danish version which is equivalent to AF or
AFL (427.4) in the international version). From January 1994,
the ICD-10 classification was used with the diagnosis of AF and/
or AFL (I.48). The validity of the combined diagnosis of AF
and/or AFL is high, with a positive predictive value of 92.6% in
this cohort.17 If a patient had both an emergency room visit and
a hospital admission on the same date, only the in-hospital diag-
nosis was considered in order to avoid possible misclassification.
In line with previous observational studies, the combined diag-
nosis of ‘AF and/or AFL’ was referred to as AF.
Other covariates
W
e obtained information on demographics and lifestyle factors
using a self-administered questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI),
blood pressure and total cholesterol were measured by a labora-
tory technician at the time of recruitment.18 W
e used self-
reports, ICD codes and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
(ATC) drug codes to obtain information on prevalent and inci-
dent hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease
(yes/no).19
Statistical analysis
Individuals were considered at risk from the date of the study
questionnaire (1993–1997) until the date of first hospital admis-
sion for AF, death, emigration or end of follow-up (December
2009), whichever came first. Consistent with prior studies on
chocolate intake and AF, we modelled chocolate intake using
the following categories of servings of 1 ounce bars or packets
of chocolate: <1/month, 1–3/month, 1/week, 2–6/week and ≥1/
day. W
e constructed multivariable Cox proportional hazards
models with age as the time scale and allowed the baseline
hazard to vary by sex to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between
chocolate intake and the rate of AF. W
e chose covariates a
priori20 that we considered potential confounders on the basis
of their association with development of AF: from the baseline
data we included information on sex, BMI (kg/m2), systolic
blood pressure (mm Hg), total serum cholesterol (continuous),
total calories (continuous), coffee consumption (continuous),
alcohol consumption (g/day), smoking status (never, former,
current) and years of education beyond elementary school
(0,<3, 3–4, >4 years). W
e used regularly updated information
on hypertension (yes/no), diabetes mellitus (yes/no) and cardio-
vascular disease (yes/no) using time-varying covariates. Because
there was no gradient in caffeine across categories of chocolate
intake and it may be a consequence of chocolate intake, we did
not include caffeine consumption as a covariate. W
e conducted
tests of the linear component of trend for increasing categories
of chocolate intake by assigning the median values for each cat-
egory and testing the statistical significance of the term in the
multivariable model.
T
o test the robustness of the model, we examined whether
the HRs varied by sex, history of hypertension, diabetes or car-
diovascular disease by conducting likelihood ratio tests to
compare models with versus without cross-product terms for
categories of exposure and the potential modifier. W
e con-
structed a multivariable model further adjusted for caffeine
from sources other than chocolate (coffee, tea and soft drinks)
instead of adjusting for coffee consumption. Since unrecognised
illness may influence chocolate consumption at baseline, we con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis excluding the first 2 years or 5 years
of follow-up.
W
e
tested
the
proportional
hazard
assumptions
using
Schoenfeld residuals and interactions with the logarithm of time,
and we found no significant violations after allowing the baseline
hazard to vary by sex. Statistical analyses were performed using
Stata V
.13 (Stata Corp, College Station, T
exas, USA) with two-
tailed tests set at α=0.05 for statistical significance.
RESULTS
Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study
Among the 57 053 women and men recruited, we excluded par-
ticipants for whom information was missing on chocolate intake
(n=16), inclusion date (n=42) or one or more confounders
(n=477). In addition, we excluded one participant with no
FFQ, 451 participants with a previous record of AF in the
Danish Registry and 564 participants who had a history of
cancer at baseline (the primary outcome of the original cohort
study). This resulted in a sample of 55 502 participants for
these analyses. In total, 3346 incident cases of AF occurred
during a median of 13.5 years of follow-up. Overall, 36% of
the sample were current smokers at baseline. Participants with
higher levels of chocolate intake were more likely to report
higher levels of daily caloric intake, a higher proportion of cal-
ories from chocolate and a higher level of educational attain-
ment (table 1).
Compared with chocolate intake of less than once per month,
the rate of AF was lower for people consuming 1–3 servings/
month (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.98), 1 serving/week (HR
0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.92), 2–6 servings/week (HR 0.80, 95%
CI 0.71 to 0.91) and ≥1 servings/day (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65
to 1.09; p-linear trend <0.0001; figure 1).
In analyses stratified by sex, the incidence rate of AF was
lower among women than men at each level of chocolate intake,
but the lower risk of AF with higher levels of chocolate intake
was apparent for both men (p-linear trend=0.002) and women
(p-linear trend=0.017) in the multivariable models accounting
for several potential confounders (figure 1). Among women, the
strongest inverse association was seen for one serving of choc-
olate per week (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95) and, among
men, the strongest inverse association was seen for 2–6 servings
of chocolate per week (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.90).

 In sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the model, the
results were similar across levels of history of hypertension
(p-interaction=0.69)
and
cardiovascular
disease
(p-interaction=0.74). Although the results were different for
the 284 individuals with diabetes (p-interaction=0.01), this was
driven by the small number of individuals with diabetes who
reported high levels of chocolate intake. The results were almost
identical when we adjusted for caffeine from sources other than
chocolate (coffee, tea and soft drinks) instead of adjusting for
coffee consumption.
The results were not meaningfully altered in analyses exclud-
ing the first 2 or 5 years of follow-up, suggesting that the results
are not likely to be due to the potential impact of reverse
causation.
DISCUSSION
In the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study, higher levels of
chocolate intake were associated with an 11–20% lower rate of
clinically apparent AF among men and women. W
e adjusted for
total caloric intake since, a priori, we anticipated that it would
be associated with the risk of AF and may confound the associ-
ation. Since chocolate only contributes a small proportion of
total calories, the results of the model do not imply that higher
levels of chocolate intake results in substantially lower intake of
other foods.
T
wo prior prospective cohort studies examined the associ-
ation between chocolate intake and the rate of AF. Our results
are consistent with results from the W
omen’s Health Study
which reported that moderate chocolate intake was associated
with a 1–14% lower rate of self-reported AF, although the esti-
mates for each category of intake did not reach statistical signifi-
cance.21 Conversely, results from the Physicians’ Health Study
of men did not find evidence of an association between choc-
olate intake and self-reported AF, and the point estimates sug-
gested that higher levels of chocolate intake may be associated
with a 4–14% higher rate of self-reported AF, although the
results did not reach statistical significance.22 In the current
study, the lower rate of AF with higher levels of chocolate
intake was apparent for both men and women.
There are several potential sources of heterogeneity across the
studies. In this study we identified cases of clinically apparent
AF as a primary cause in the National Registry whereas the
prior two studies assessed the risk of self-reported AF verified in
medical records. Based on the two prior studies, it may appear
that the association varies by sex, but the results were similar for
men and women enrolled in the Danish Diet, Cancer, and
Health Study. It is possible that the accuracy of self-reported
chocolate intake or AF symptoms was different for the sample
of women recruited from the general population in
the
W
omen’s Health Study compared with reporting by the physi-
cians enrolled in the Physicians’ Health Study, but it is unclear
how this would result in a systematic bias. It is also possible that
the presence of potential confounding by factors related to
chocolate intake and AF risk is different for the two samples,
but this too is not clear or verifiable from the available data.
Since chocolate in Europe has a higher cocoa content than choc-
olate in the USA,16 it is possible that our results were stronger
than the results of the two US studies due to higher intake of
potentially protective components of chocolate per serving.
Recent evidence suggests that an inflammatory cascade result-
ing in leucocyte activation may lead to generation of reactive
oxygen species, proliferation of fibroblasts and adverse turnover
in matrix proteins. This may result in electrical and structural
atrial remodelling and lead to the incidence of AF. The
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties of
cocoa may improve endothelial function, lipid levels, blood
pressure and insulin resistance23 and decrease fibrosis and down-
stream electrical and structural remodelling of atrial tissue.10 11
In addition, a typical 100 calorie serving of dark chocolate con-
tains 36 mg of magnesium, which has hypotensive and antiar-
rhythmic effects.24 These properties may explain the lower
cardiovascular risk associated with moderate chocolate intake.
The higher flavonoid content of dark chocolate compared
with milk chocolate may yield greater cardiovascular benefits. A
randomised trial found that, compared with milk chocolate,
dark chocolate may have a higher caloric content but it also pro-
motes greater satiety and lowers the desire to eat something
sweet, resulting in an overall lower caloric intake.25 In addition,
flavanol content and total antioxidant capacity in plasma may be
lower if cocoa is consumed with milk or if cocoa is ingested as
milk chocolate.26 Furthermore, cocoa is usually consumed in
high calorie products that use fat and sugar, and modern manu-
facturing of chocolate may result in losses of more than 80% of
the original flavonoids from the cocoa beans.27 Therefore, it
may be advantageous to find ways to consume cocoa in forms
other than chocolate bars. The ongoing Cocoa Supplement and
Multivitamin Outcomes Study is a large randomised trial testing
the effect of a concentrated cocoa extract on cardiovascular risk,
and may provide insight on the efficacy and feasibility of ingest-
ing cocoa in this form.
There are some limitations to our study that warrant discus-
sion. Although we had extensive data on diet, lifestyle and
comorbidities, we cannot preclude the possibility of residual or
unmeasured confounding. For instance, data were not available
on renal disease and sleep apnoea. However, after adjusting for
age, smoking status and other potential confounders, the associ-
ation was somewhat attenuated but remained statistically signifi-
cant. W
e did not have information on the type of chocolate or
cocoa concentration. However, most of the chocolate consumed
in Denmark is milk chocolate. In the European Union, milk
chocolate must contain a minimum of 30% cocoa solids and
dark chocolate must contain a minimum of 43% cocoa solids;
the corresponding proportions in the USA are 10% and 35%.16
Despite the fact that most of the chocolate consumed in our
sample probably contained relatively low concentrations of the
potentially protective ingredients, we still observed a robust stat-
istically significant association, suggesting that our findings may
underestimate the protective effects of dark chocolate.
As with any study using self-reported exposure information,
there is a concern of poor recall. However, our FFQ was vali-
dated in a study comparing two 7-day weighted diet records.13
Furthermore, if the misclassification of chocolate intake was
unrelated to AF incidence, our results would likely be an under-
estimate of the protective effect of chocolate. W
e have no infor-
mation on how changes in chocolate consumption may have
affected a participant’s risk of AF. Chocolate intake and covari-
ate data were only available at baseline and, for most partici-
pants, in the fifth year of follow-up and may have changed over
the 13.5 years of follow-up, resulting in some non-differential
misclassification of exposure which would reduce the power to
detect an association. In addition, this study was limited to cases
with a diagnosis of AF as a primary cause. W
e did not have infor-
mation on cases of silent AF, elective DC cardioversions or AF
reported in outpatient clinics and emergency room visits.
Therefore, it is likely that we substantially underestimated the
overall incidence of AF in the population. However, the restric-
tion to diagnosed incident AF cases should not affect the validity
of the current study since the identification of diagnosed

 symptomatic AF is unlikely to be impacted by levels of habitual
chocolate intake. Finally, this study and the prior studies identi-
fied in our systematic review were primarily composed of
Caucasian participants, and the results may not be generalisable
to other populations if the association is modified by genetic
factors.
Despite these limitations, our study has many strengths
including a large sample size, a prospective population-based
design, detailed data on diet and factors potentially related to
exposure and outcome, and almost complete follow-up of the
study cohort over many years.
CONCLUSIONS
Participants with higher levels of chocolate intake had a lower
rate of clinically apparent incident AF or flutter. Future research
is necessary to confirm this finding and to determine whether
high levels of chocolate intake are associated with higher
AF risk.
Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
Several studies have reported cardiovascular benefits of
chocolate intake, but only two studies with discrepant findings
have examined the association between chocolate intake and
risk of atrial fibrillation (AF).
What might this study add?
In this large prospective cohort study we found that, compared
with individuals reporting chocolate intake less than once per
month, the rate of AF was lower for people consuming
chocolate regularly, with similar results for men and women.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
Chocolate intake may be inversely associated with AF risk.
Therefore, dark chocolate may be a healthy snack option that
helps to prevent the development of AF.
