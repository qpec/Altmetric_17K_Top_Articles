Background-—Smoking is the most important risk factor for peripheral artery disease (PAD). Smoking cessation is key in PAD
management. We aimed to examine smoking rates and smoking cessation interventions offered to patients with PAD consulting a
vascular specialty clinic; and assess changes in smoking behavior over the year following initial visit.
Methods and Results-—A total of 1272 patients with PAD and new or worsening claudication were enrolled at 16 vascular
specialty clinics (2011–2015, PORTRAIT (Patient-Centered Outcomes Related to Treatment Practices in Peripheral Arterial Disease:
Investigating Trajectories) registry). Interviews collected smoking status and cessation interventions at baseline, 3, 6, and
12 months. Among smokers, transition state models analyzed smoking transitions at each time point and identified factors
associated with quitting and relapse. On presentation, 474 (37.3%) patients were active, 660 (51.9%) former, and 138 (10.8%)
never smokers. Among active smokers, only 16% were referred to cessation counseling and 11% were prescribed pharmacologic
treatment. At 3 months, the probability of quitting smoking was 21%; among those continuing to smoke at 3 months, the
probability of quitting during the next 9 months varied between 11% and 12% (P<0.001). The probability of relapse among initial
quitters was 36%. At 12 months, 72% of all smokers continued to smoke.
Conclusions-—More than one third of patients with claudication consulting a PAD provider are active smokers and few received
evidence-based cessation interventions. Patients appear to be most likely to quit early in their treatment course, but many quickly
relapse and 72% of all patients smoking at baseline are still smoking at 12 months. Better strategies are needed to provide
continuous cessation support.

eripheral artery disease (PAD) affects 202 million adults
worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity
and mortality.1 Cigarette smoking is the most important and
modifiable risk factor for PAD. Patients with PAD who smoke
have higher rates of disease progression,2–4 greater risk of
complications secondary to PAD,5 poor post-procedural
outcomes,6 compromised functional status,7 and increased
hospitalizations; all accounting for a higher patient and
societal burden.8 Furthermore, active tobacco use in patients
with PAD is strongly associated with a significant increase in

 cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and
death,5,9–11 underscoring the urgent need for smoking
cessation efforts in this population.
Smoking cessation is a critical component of secondary
prevention guidelines in PAD and has been endorsed as a
performance measure of quality.12 In fact, the guidelines for
PAD management give a grade IA recommendation for asking
the smoking status of a PAD patient at each assessment and
offering smoking cessation support to all who actively smoke.13
Despite the key role that has been attributed to smoking as a
risk factor in PAD, and the availability of effective smoking
cessation treatments,13–15 there are surprisingly few contem-
porary data describing the current prevalence of smoking in
PAD patients and physicians’ efforts to encourage smoking
cessation.16–18 There is also limited understanding how the
habits of smokers with PAD change after they consult their
physician for symptoms related to PAD.
To address these gaps in knowledge, we used the
PORTRAIT (Patient-Centered Outcomes Related to Treatment
Practices in Peripheral Arterial Disease: Investigating Trajec-
tories) registry, an international, multicenter registry of
patients presenting to specialty clinics with new or worsening
symptoms of PAD, to assess the smoking status of patients
with PAD. The PORTRAIT registry is an ideal foundation for
evaluating smoking cessation interventions at critical time in
PAD care, as enrolled patients had new or worsening PAD
symptoms warranting specialty consultation. Therefore, we
aimed to: (1) examine smoking rates in patients with PAD
consulting a vascular specialty clinic; (2) determine smoking
cessation interventions provided at those visits and its
variability across centers; and (3) assess changes in smoking
behavior over the year following initial PAD consultation. Also,
as the PORTRAIT registry enrolled patients from the United
States, the Netherlands, and Australia, we examined differ-
ences in smoking patterns and provision of smoking cessation
support across these countries.

Study Population
PORTRAIT is a multicenter, international prospective registry
that enrolled 1275 patients with symptomatic PAD presenting
to 16 PAD specialty clinics across the United States, the
Netherlands, and Australia from June 2011 to December
2015. Study details have been described previously.20 In brief,
adults presenting to a PAD specialist with new-onset or a
recent exacerbation of exertional leg symptoms, and an
abnormal resting ankle brachial index (≤0.90) or a significant
drop in post-exercise ankle pressure of ≥20 mm Hg, were
included. Patients with non-compressible ankle brachial
indexes (≥1.3), critical limb ischemia, prior peripheral inter-
vention within the past year on the same leg with current
claudication symptoms and those who were incarcerated,
hard of hearing, unable to speak English, Dutch, or Spanish or
unable to provide informed consent were excluded.
Initial visit in this registry refers to the first visit for patients
with PAD with a specialty PAD provider for evaluation of their
claudication symptoms. Patient demographics, health status,
psychosocial characteristics, and socioeconomic and cardio-
vascular lifestyle factors were obtained by interview at the
initial visit. Patients’ symptoms, medical history, comorbidi-
ties, and PAD diagnostic information were abstracted from
their medical records. Serial information about patients’
health status, psychosocial and lifestyle factors, including
smoking status, was collected at 3, 6, and 12 months of
follow-up through telephone interviews.
All study participants provided either written or telephonic
informed consent. The study protocol was approved by
Institutional Review Boards of all participating sites.
Smoking Status Assessment
Baseline smoking status was assessed through in-person
interviews using the following response options21: (1) I have
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• A third of 1272 patients with symptomatic peripheral
arterial disease were active smokers on initial presentation
to a vascular clinic, however <1 in 5 were referred to formal
cessation counseling and 1 in 10 were prescribed pharma-
cologic treatment to help stop smoking.
• Chances for quitting were highest in the first 3 months
(20%), although about a third of these initial quitters
relapsed within a year, with 72% of active smokers at
baseline continuing to smoke a year later.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The dynamic nature of peripheral artery disease patient’s
smoking practices underscores the need for ongoing
assessment of smoking, even among those who report that
they had quit.
• Improved efforts to offer ongoing evidence-based cessation
support are needed for patients with peripheral artery
disease.

 never smoked, not even a puff, (2) I have smoked in the past
but <100 cigarettes in total, (3) I stopped smoking >1 year
ago, (4) I stopped smoking between 1 month and 1 year ago,
and (5) I have smoked (even a puff) in the past 30 days.
Responses (1) and (2) were categorized as never smokers,
responses (3) and (4) were categorized as former smokers,
and response (5) was categorized as current smokers. At
follow-up assessments, patients were asked via telephone
interviews if they had smoked within the past 30 days
(regardless of their baseline smoking status).
Provision of Smoking Cessation Support
The smoking cessation intervention performance measure was
collected at baseline via chart abstraction and confirmed with
patient interviews. It included 3 metrics: (1) physician advice
to quit smoking; (2) referral to formal smoking cessation
counseling; and (3) prescription of pharmacologic treatment
(bupropion or varenicline) or nicotine replacement therapies
(nicotine patch, gum, lozenge, nasal spray, or inhaler) to aid
smoking cessation. For patients who did not receive smoking
cessation support, patient (eg, patient refusal), medical (eg,
medical contra-indication or prior receipt of treatment), and
system (eg, unavailability of smoking cessation program within
the medical system, insurance issues, etc,). were captured if
they were felt to be contributory.
Statistical Analysis
Smoking status at initial visit
The proportion of current, former, and never smokers at the
initial visit was calculated. Differences between demographic,
socioeconomic, psychosocial, risk factors, health status,
treatment, and disease characteristics were compared among
patients by smoking status using ANOVA for continuous
variables and the Chi-square or Fisher exact test for
categorical variables.
Provision of smoking cessation support
Rates of provision of overall and individual components of
smoking cessation support measures were assessed for the
entire population.
Variability in provision of smoking cessation support
Variability in provision of smoking cessation support measures
among sites was assessed by estimating median odds ratios
(MORs). It estimates the average relative difference in provision
of cessation support between 2 randomly selected sites. An
MOR of 1 for site variability indicates no site-level variation in
offering cessation support, while an MOR of 2 suggests a
median 2-fold difference in the odds of receiving cessation
support between 2 random sites. As all smoking patients
should receive cessation support regardless of their personal
characteristics, we did not adjust for patient factors in the MOR
model. We however, did adjust for country and provider to
assess the effect of country and provider on site variability.
Predominant smoking patterns in active smokers over
the course of a year
Using both baseline and follow-up smoking status informa-
tion, proportions of patients who smoked throughout the
follow-up period (persistent smokers), stopped smoking and
did not restart on follow-up (sustained quitters), and those
who stopped smoking but started smoking on follow-up
(relapsers) were estimated among active smokers at baseline.
Transition probabilities between smoking and
non-smoking states on follow-up
Recognizing that smoking cessation is a dynamic process
where different patients quit and relapse at and for various
times over the period of observation, we fit a transition model
to estimate the probabilities of transitioning from a smoking
to non-smoking state (quit attempts) and from a non-smoking
state to a smoking state (relapse) between consecutive
assessments. Based on the framework developed by Yeh
et al,22 we used a time-inhomogeneous non-Markov transition
model to identify potential patient factors associated with
transitions from smoking to non-smoking (quit) and from non-
smoking to smoking (relapse). The transition model consisted
of 2 simultaneous longitudinal logistic regressions, 1 predict-
ing quit attempts and 1 predicting relapses. Generalized
estimating equations were used to account for within-patient
correlations between repeated assessments. Prespecified
predictors at baseline included country, age, sex, non-
Caucasian race, marital status, education, chronic lung
disease, positive screen for alcohol abuse (Alcohol Use
Disorders Identification Test-Concise [AUDIT-C] question-
naire),23 perceived stress score (Perceived Stress Scale-4),24
patient health questionnaire-8 depression score,25 positive
screen for anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 item scale
[GAD-2]),26 provision of smoking cessation supports at the
time of the visit, smoking behavior transitions at 6 and
12 months, and patients’ 3-month smoking status.
Missing data
Multiple imputation was used to account for missing smoking
status information at follow-up assessments (14% [539/
3816] of total time points), accounting for sociodemographic,
comorbidity, psychosocial factors, smoking cessation mea-
sures, and smoking status at other available time points
(listed in Table S1). Point estimates for smoking statuses,
transition probabilities and model effects were similar for
complete-case (Figure S1) and imputed data; we report results
based on imputed data here, which correctly accounts for

 biases attributable to observed factors and uncertainty
because of missingness.
Country-specific smoking and smoking cessation
patterns
Country-specific differences between patients in the United
States, the Netherlands, and Australia in smoking behavior at
baseline, change in smoking patterns on follow-up, and
provider adherence to smoking cessation measures were
compared using Chi-square test or Fisher-exact test.
All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and R version 3.3.1.27
Results
Smoking Status at Initial Visit
Of 1272 patients presenting with PAD-related symptoms to a
vascular specialty clinic, 474 (37.3%) patients were active,
660 (51.9%) former (585 quit >1 year ago, 75 quit between
1 month–1 year), and 138 (10.8%) were never smokers at the
initial visit. Current smokers at the initial visit were younger,
more likely to be working either full-time or part-time and less
likely to have a high school or greater education (Table). They
also were more likely to present with new-onset symptoms
that were longer in duration and to have lower ankle brachial
indexes. They were more likely to have proximal disease and
have had a prior peripheral vascular intervention. Current
smokers were less likely to have cardiac comorbidities,
diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease, but more likely to
have chronic lung disease. Current smokers were also more
likely to be depressed and have poorer general health status
than former and non-smokers, however they had comparable
PAD-specific health status at baseline.
Provision of Smoking Cessation Support
Overall, 359 (75.7%) smokers received some form of cessa-
tion intervention: the majority 350 (73.8%) received only
physician advice to quit, 74 (15.6%) received referral to a
formal smoking cessation counseling program, and only 50
(10.5%) received pharmacologic treatment or nicotine replace-
ment therapy. For patients who were not referred to smoking
cessation counseling, patient, medical and system reasons
were reported as contributory factors in 7 (1.5%), 17 (3.6%)
and 3 (0.6%) respectively; however no reason was docu-
mented in most patients (373, 78.7%). For patients who did
not receive pharmacologic treatment, patient, medical and
system reasons were reported as contributory factors in 9
(1.9%), 17 (3.6%) and 4 (0.8%) respectively; however no reason
was documented in most patients (394, 83.1%).
Site variability in Provision of Smoking Cessation
Support
There was significant site variability in provision of smoking
cessation performance measures (Table S2 and Figure 1).
Site variability for any cessation intervention (advice, coun-
seling or nicotine replacement therapy), as assessed by
median odds ratio (MOR) was 2.13 (95% confidence interval
[CI]: 1.51, 3.69;<0.001). That is, between two randomly
selected sites, there was, on average, a greater than 2-fold
odds of receiving any cessation support at one random site,
as compared with another. This variability was not influenced by
Figure 1. Site variability in provision of smoking cessation interventions. Median odds ratios estimate the
median of all possible odds ratios between 2 randomly selected sites, MOR of 1 suggests no variability
(unadjusted analysis). MOR indicates median odds ratio.

 differences between countries (country-adjusted MOR=2.06; 95%
CI: 1.45, 3.75; P<0.001). Greater variability was observed for
referral to formal smoking cessation counseling programs or
pharmacologic therapy and nicotine replacement therapy
prescription (MOR=3.41 (95% CI: 2.15, 7.72), P<0.001),
although a portion of this variation was attributable to
differences between countries (country-adjusted MOR=2.27).
Predominant Smoking Patterns in Active
Smokers Over the Course of a Year
Two thirds of active smokers continued to smoke throughout
the 12 months of follow-up (Table S3). Approximately 1 in 10
patients relapsed after quitting at some point during follow-
up. Among the patients who were sustained quitters (117/
474, 24.6%), most (63, 13.4%) quit within the first 3 months
of follow-up.
Transition Probabilities Between Smoking and
Non-Smoking States on Follow-Up Among Active
Smokers at Initial Visit
Among active smokers at baseline, the probability of smoking
at 12 months was 72% (95% CI: 67%–76%; Figure 2). The
likelihood of stopping smoking was greatest at 3 months
(21%, 95% CI: 18%–26%); among those who persisted smoking
at 3 months, the rate of subsequently stopping was 11% (95%
CI: 8%–15%) at 6 months and 12% (95% CI: 8%–16%) at
12 months; P<0.001 versus 3 months). Moreover, among
patients who stopped smoking at some point, there was a
notable likelihood of relapse by the next assessment (18%
(95% CI: 11%–26%) from 3 to 6 months; 25% (95% CI: 17%–
36%) from 6 to 12 months). In multivariable analysis,
continued smoking at 3 months was the greatest predictor
of future smoking behavior after adjustment for multiple

Country-Specific Smoking and Smoking
Cessation Patterns
Country-specific variations in proportions of smokers at initial
visit, provider adherence to smoking cessation measures and
predominant smoking patterns over follow-up are described in
Tables S3, S4 and Figures S3 and S4. The Netherlands had a
higher proportion of current smokers as compared with
Australia and the United States. Provision of smoking
cessation support, including referral rates to formal cessation
counseling, were low across all countries, but greater in the
United States as compared with the Netherlands and
Australia. While the United States had a steady sustained
quit rate at all follow-up time points, the majority of sustained
quitters in the Netherlands stopped smoking in the first
3 months, while those in Australia were more likely to quit
after 3 to 6 months of follow-up.
Discussion
A critical intervention for patients with symptomatic PAD is to
stop smoking. Among 1275 patients presenting with PAD
symptoms to a specialty clinic across the United States, the
Netherlands, and Australia, we found that over a third were
active smokers at their initial visit. Chances of quitting were
highest within the first 3 months of their initial vascular

 provider visit (21% quit rate). The predominant strategy used
by providers to help their smoking patients to quit was simply
to tell them to stop, with less than 1 in 5 smokers being
referred to a smoking cessation counseling program and only
1 in 10 receiving pharmacologic treatment or nicotine
replacement therapy. Regardless of the intervention, there
was substantial variability in smoking cessation interventions
across sites. More importantly, we found that smoking
patterns were dynamic over time, with a high rate of relapse,
highlighting the need for repeated and continuous cessation
support in patients with symptomatic PAD.
PORTRAIT is a large multicenter, international prospective
registry of symptomatic patients with PAD and our findings
significantly extend the extant literature on smoking patterns
in patients with PAD. Previous reports that studied the
prevalence of smoking and the use of cessation support in
PAD patients have been largely cross-sectional, done in
preprocedural, hospitalization settings or primary care set-
tings, or relied exclusively on administrative codes.16,17,28,29
The global REACH (Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Con-
tinued Health) registry found that 22% of patients with PAD
were current smokers, a prevalence almost double that of
patients with other forms of atherosclerotic disease.18 More
recently, an analysis of US National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey of primary and specialty clinic visits with various
stages of PAD by Berger et al showed a 20% prevalence of
current smokers.17 Our study extends these prior findings by
prospectively documenting smoking behavior in more than a
third of patients with confirmed PAD being evaluated for new
or worsening claudication symptoms in a specialty care
setting. Moreover, we were able to follow these patients over
a year to describe their treatments and smoking behaviors,
which is, to our knowledge, the first insight into these patterns
over time. In contrast to PAD, for other atherosclerotic disease
states like coronary artery disease, numerous studies have
shown a much higher rate of smoking cessation, counseling,
and sustained quit rates in active smokers in various settings
such as stable outpatients with coronary artery disease,
myocardial infarction or elective percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI),30–32 which might be related to mandatory
performance measure reporting, increased awareness about
the association of smoking and adverse outcomes among
patients and providers, and increased motivation to quit after a
life-threatening event such as myocardial infarction.
This study demonstrates the dynamic nature of smoking
and smoking cessation among patients with PAD. More than a
third of patients were current smokers when they presented
to a PAD provider and half were former smokers. Two thirds
of active smokers continued smoking throughout the year
following their PAD clinic visit. The highest quit rate measured
was at the time window immediately after the PAD evaluation
(21%). Among those who initially quit, more than a third
relapsed, underscoring the challenge of getting patients to
stop smoking. Our data also show that this addiction
disproportionately affects patients who are younger and more
socioeconomically disadvantaged. The scope of this problem
calls for concerted efforts aimed at continuous risk assess-
ment for relapse and repeated efforts to provide evidence-
based interventions to maximize smoking cessation outcomes
in PAD.
Evidence-based treatments for tobacco cessation are
widely available. Pharmacologic therapy or formal cessation
counseling have been shown to be more effective and cost-
efficient than physician advice alone in helping smokers
quit.8,14,33 Prior cross-sectional studies have shown smoking
cessation measure prescription rates varying from 36% to 53%
in patients with PAD in the primary care and specialty
setting.16,17 However, some of these studies relied on
administrative codes and could not assess the symptom
status of patients with PAD.17 Our study showed that these
more effective cessation support measures were heavily
underutilized: as little as 11% received pharmacotherapy, and
16% received referral to formal cessation counseling. Wide
variability was observed across sites in providing smoking
cessation support: for an active smoker, there was a >2.5 to
3-fold odds in whether or not they were getting referred for
cessation counseling in going from one site to another, even
after adjusting for country differences. In our study, the
cessation therapies were not predictors of quit or relapse
states, however this finding may be secondary to limited
power because of fewer number of events. Multiple PAD
guidelines have given a grade 1 recommendation for providing
smoking cessation support for actively smoking patients with
PAD.13,34,35 It has also been proposed as a performance
measure by PAD experts,36 however it has not yet been
endorsed by National Quality Forum for PAD.37 Vascular and
cardiac specialists have a unique opportunity to emphasize
smoking cessation when the patients present to them for
treatment of severe symptoms related to PAD. But these
patients will also need continuous and repeated reinforce-
ments on smoking cessation, as we observed a high rate of
relapse. Mandatory implementation of smoking cessation
support provision as a quality metric for vascular specialty
clinics and increased advocacy and outreach of professional
vascular provider societies emphasizing repeated provision of
cessation support at each visit or hospitalization by vascular
disease providers is essential to achieve higher smoking
cessation rates in this high-risk population. Furthermore,
establishment of health systems’ infrastructure to facilitate
easy referral and access to smoking cessation counselors and
programs by vascular specialists and patients could help
increase the use of these services by clinicians and patients.
Given the cardiovascular, economic, societal, and financial
effects of smoking in patients with PAD,5,8,9,38,39 our study

 suggests that a shift in thinking is needed in the management
of PAD. Addiction disorders are increasingly managed as a
chronic disease using individualized and evidence-based
strategies.40,41 Tobacco addiction deserves to be treated in
the same way and screening and resources should be made
available accordingly. Collaborative, interdisciplinary strate-
gies at the system-level are likely needed to ensure consis-
tent, ongoing cessation support in an evidence-based fashion.
These systems need to not only address cessation at intake,
but also need to recognize that relapse is common and that
some patients, who initially do not respond to treatment, may
be able to successfully quit later. Quality benchmarks should
be developed and implemented so that all patients get
consistent, high-quality of cessation interventions across
different health systems.
The results of our study should be viewed in the context of
the following potential limitations. We used patient-reported
smoking status and did not confirm active smoking or
abstinence with biochemical testing. Thus, there is a potential
for misclassification of smoking status. However, prior
research has shown that self-report correlates well with
biochemical testing.42,43 Also, as our study is a non-
interventional observational study, the risk of bias towards
misreporting of smoking status, if any, should be small. Our
findings only reflected cessation activities conducted at the
PAD clinic. Some cessation activities may have also occurred
in the primary care physician’s office; however, we did abstract
data from the medical records of the specialty providers and if
they were deferring treatment to the primary care providers
this should have been documented and captured by our data
collection process. Given our focus on PAD specialty clinics,
our findings might not be reflective of the general PAD
population which includes asymptomatic patients and those
never referred for specialty care. However, given that smoking
cessation is highlighted in specialty management guidelines
and proposed performance measures for PAD, and that we
captured the patients on their first visit to a specialty provider
for management of their PAD symptoms, it is likely that the use
of smoking cessation interventions is even lower in general
practice. While we tried to capture patient, system, and
medical reasons smoking support was not provided, no reason
was documented for most of the patients who did not receive
cessation support. As such, we could not determine the exact
reason if any, smoking support was not provided by the PAD
provider. Finally, even though we adjusted for multiple
demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial and clinical fac-
tors, there might be residual confounders (eg, passive smoke
exposure, quality of smoking cessation support) which could
potentially affect the patients’ probabilities of abstinence and
relapses. Also, as we had small numbers of quitting and
relapse events on follow-up, we had limited power to identify
additional potential predictors of smoking behavior.
In conclusion, our study provides contemporary real-world
data on smoking behavior and smoking cessation practices in
patients with PAD. More than a third of patients who present
to specialty care for evaluation of claudication symptoms are
actively smoking, and 72% of these patients are smoking
12 months later. Importantly, few patients receive formal
cessation interventions. The dynamic nature of these patients’
smoking practices also underscores the need for ongoing
assessment of smoking, even among those who report that
they have quit, and consistent offering of evidence-based
cessation support. Future research should focus on identify-
ing optimal strategies for implementing consistent cessation
support.

 Table S3: Predominant smoking patterns on follow-up among active smokers with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease at 
initial visit. Presented as N (%) for patients with available smoking status assessments on follow-up. Persistent smokers= patient 
reported smoking at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months of follow-up; Sustained quitters= Patient stopped smoking at that time point and 
remained quit through 12 months of follow-up (12 month- patient stopped smoking at 12 months- follow-up not available); Relapsers= 
Active smokers at baseline who reported stopping smoking at any time point on follow-up, but restarted smoking thereafter.

Figure S1: Transition probabilities between smoking and non-smoking states between follow-up time points among active 
smokers with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease at initial visit. The blue arrows denote the probability of transition from 
smoking to non-smoking state (abstinence) and red arrows denote the probability of transition from non-smoking to smoking state 
(relapse) (Proportions derived from raw data with available smoking status assessments, Fig. 2 in the manuscript represents 
probabilities derived from imputed data after imputing 14% missing data for smoking status assessments on follow-up).

 Figure S2: Multivariable predictors of quitting and relapse states at follow-up among active smokers at initial visit presenting 
with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Quitting was defined as transition from smoking to non-smoking state between 
consecutive time points and Relapse was defined as transition from non-smoking to smoking state between consecutive time points 
(after 3 months). Estimates are Odds Ratios (95% Confidence Intervals) calculated from transition models.
