Abstract
Prediction of drug combinations that effectively target cancer cells is a critical challenge for
cancer therapy, in particular for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive
breast cancer subtype with no effective targeted treatment. As signalling pathway networks
critically control cancer cell behaviour, analysis of signalling network activity and crosstalk
can help predict potent drug combinations and rational stratification of patients, thus bringing
therapeutic and prognostic values. We have previously showed that the non-receptor tyro-
sine kinase PYK2 is a downstream effector of EGFR and c-Met and demonstrated their
crosstalk signalling in basal-like TNBC. Here we applied a systems modelling approach and
developed a mechanistic model of the integrated EGFR-PYK2-c-Met signalling network to
identify and prioritize potent drug combinations for TNBC. Model predictions validated by
experimental data revealed that among six potential combinations of drug pairs targeting
the central nodes of the network, including EGFR, c-Met, PYK2 and STAT3, co-targeting of
EGFR and PYK2 and to a lesser extent of EGFR and c-Met yielded strongest synergistic
effect. Importantly, the synergy in co-targeting EGFR and PYK2 was linked to switch-like
cell proliferation-associated responses. Moreover, simulations of patient-specific models
using public gene expression data of TNBC patients led to predictive stratification of patients
into subgroups displaying distinct susceptibility to specific drug combinations. These results
suggest that mechanistic systems modelling is a powerful approach for the rational design,
prediction and prioritization of potent combination therapies for individual patients, thus pro-
viding a concrete step towards personalized treatment for TNBC and other tumour types.

 Author summary
We applied a systems modelling approach combining mechanistic modelling and biologi-
cal experimentation to identify effective drug combinations for triple-negative breast can-
cer (TNBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with no approved targeted treatment.
The model predicted and prioritized the synergistic combinations as confirmed by experi-
mental data, demonstrating the power of this approach. Moreover, analysis of clinical data
of TNBC patients and patient-specific modelling simulation enabled us to stratify the
patients into subgroups with distinct susceptibility to specific drug combinations, and
thus defined a subset of patient that could benefit from the combined treatments.
Introduction
Resistance to anti-cancer drugs is a major clinical problem and a prevalent cause of cancer-
related death. Consequently, combination therapy has recently emerged as a powerful strategy
to circumvent drug resistance and thus is being actively pursued in many cancers [1]. Yet, we
face daunting challenges of how to predict the best combinations of targets and importantly,
how to prioritize those combinations for clinical testing. Given the number of possible target
combinations are vast but clinical trials are slow and expensive, there is an urgent need to
develop rational and unbiased approaches to predict effective drug combinations, prioritize
them and stratify patients for optimal benefit.
Analysis of the activity and dynamics of signalling networks should aid in the development
of effective combination therapies against oncogenic kinases [2]. However, signalling networks
often contain complex pathway crosstalk and feedback regulation, making it difficult to ana-
lyse the drug-induced network behaviours and emergent network features using experimental
approaches alone [3]. Instead, experimentally-grounded mathematical models of signalling
networks that integrate pathway crosstalk and feedback loops provide a powerful quantitative
framework for the systematic analysis of network-level dynamics [4–6]. As feedback loops
often lead to unexpected adverse effects of drug treatments, these models have the power to
predict effective and non-trivial combination treatments in cancer cells [3]. Here, we employ a
systems-based approach combining mechanistic modelling and biological experiments to pre-
dict and prioritize drug combinations for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive
subtype of breast cancer.
While targeted therapies have vastly improved the survival of ER/PR-(Estrogen/Progester-
one receptor) and HER2/ErbB2-positive breast cancers, TNBC, which is defined by the
absence of these hormone receptors and of HER2 amplification [7], remains a major clinical
challenge with no efficient targeted therapy [8]. TNBC comprises an heterogeneous group of
cancers with at least six molecular subtypes (BL1: basal-like 1, BL2: basal-like 2, IM: immuno-
modulatory, M: mesenchymal, MSL: mesenchymal stem-like, and LAR: luminal androgen
receptor), which display different clinico-pathological features and divergent responses to
treatments [9]. This heterogeneity requires efficient patient stratification strategies, capable of
predictively selecting most suitable patients for specific treatments, while excluding the unsuit-
able individuals or subgroups.
Several signalling pathways, including the PI3K/mTOR pathway, JAK/STAT, Ras/Raf as
well as the EGFR and c-Met pathways have been considered as potential therapeutic targets for
TNBC [10]. The Tyrosine Receptor Kinases EGFR and c-Met are highly expressed in TNBC
and implicated in TNBC progression and metastasis [11–13]. However, their targeting by
monotherapeutic agents has a marginal clinical efficacy possibly due to bidirectional

 compensatory responses, activation of alternative pathway(s), and/or other resistance mecha-
nisms [14,15]. EGFR and c-Met share overlapping downstream signalling pathways and can
trans-phosphorylate one another. We have recently found that PYK2 is a common down-
stream effector of EGFR and c-Met; and have delineated their crosstalk signalling in TNBC,
demonstrating that knockdown of PYK2 facilitates receptor degradation and concomitantly
inhibits EGF-induced ERK1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation. PYK2 positively regulates
STAT3-phosphorylation in response to EGFR activation, while pSTAT3 binds to the PYK2
promoter and enhances PYK2 transcription, and indirectly upregulates c-Met expression [16].
These results suggest a number of positive-feedback loops between PYK2, STAT3, c-Met and
EGFR, and imply that co-targeting of components of this circuit could have therapeutic
impact.
Here, we develop and experimentally validate a quantitative mechanistic model of the
EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network and demonstrate the utility of this model in accu-
rately predicting and importantly, prioritizing synergistic drug combinations for TNBC.
Notably, model predictions supported by in vitro and in vivo data reveal co-inhibition of
EGFR-PYK2 and EGFR-c-MET yield the most synergistic effects among other possible
drug combinations. Moreover, integrated modelling-experimental analysis uncovers
switch-like response to single-drug inhibition at both the signalling (STAT3 and ERK acti-
vation) and cell proliferation levels, and establish a link between these switches and the
drug synergy displayed by the combination treatment. Excitingly, simulations of patient-
specific models generated through incorporating gene expression data from individual
TNBC patients led to stratification of patients into subgroups with distinct susceptibility
to EGFR-PYK2 co-inhibition, thereby predicting a subset of highly susceptible patient
characterized by high PYK2 expression. Collectively, we present a proof-of-concept study
demonstrating the power of quantitative mechanistic modelling in the rational discovery
and prioritization of effective drug combinations for TNBC. Importantly, the principles
contained in this work are highly applicable to other signalling systems and/or tumour
types, which should significantly aid in the selection of best target combinations for fur-
ther in-depth preclinical and clinical testing.
Results
Description of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network interactions and
mathematical model assumptions
The interconnection between EGFR, PYK2 and c-Met signalling in TNBC cells and the
involvement of STAT3 activation in a positive feedback loop [16] led us to examine the
dynamic behaviours of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met signalling network in a quantitative and pre-
dictive manner. To this end, we constructed, calibrated and validated a computational model
of this network. Reconstruction of the network structure revealed a multitude of interconnec-
ted positive and negative feedback loops, suggesting the network is likely to display highly
non-linear and emergent dynamical properties. This model is based on ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) which incorporates these key feedback interactions as well as other estab-
lished regulatory mechanisms. A detailed reaction scheme of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network
is presented in Fig 1A, while a simplified schematic diagram depicting the core signal flow and
salient feedback loops is given in Fig 1B. Detailed description of the model reactions, ODEs
and parameter values are available in the Supplementary Information (S1–S3 Tables). Below,
we describe the mechanistic biological observations and regulatory mechanisms that underlie
the key model assumptions built into the model.

 Positive feedback between EGFR and PYK2
We reported recently that PYK2 is a downstream effector of both EGFR and c-Met in TNBC
cell lines, and that stimulation of EGFR or c-Met by their cognate ligands EGF or HGF,
induced rapid phosphorylation of PYK2 on tyrosine 402 (pY402) and ensuing activation [16]
(reaction 9, Fig 1A). On the other hand, PYK2 depletion substantially reduced EGFR level
shortly (30–120 mins) after EGF stimulation. These observations suggest that PYK2 either
attenuates receptor ubiquitination and consequently its lysosomal degradation (reaction 3) or
facilitates receptor deubiquitination (reaction 4). Although we assumed the former to be the
case, the model’s dynamic features are not significantly affected even if we assumed the later
instead. The reciprocal interactions between PYK2 and EGFR form a positive feedback
between these proteins, denoted as F1 in Fig 1B.
Negative feedback loops involving EGFR
As indicated in Fig 1A, EGFR is assumed to exist in three inter-convertible molecular states:
unmodified, phosphorylated (activated) and ubiquitinated (EGFRub); transition between these
states are regulated by the relevant enzyme regulators. Upon EGF binding, EGFR undergoes
rapid phosphorylation, internalization and ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl,
which targets it for lysosomal degradation [17]. As activated EGFR induces phosphorylation
(on tyrosine 371) and activation of Cbl (reaction 19) [18], which eventually leads to EGFR deg-
radation, EGFR and Cbl are connected via a negative feedback. For simplicity, we avoid
modelling of EGFR synthesis and degradation processes, and instead assume that EGFR mole-
cules targeted for degradation are locked in a dynamic pool of ubiquitinated EGFR (Fig 1A).
Similar to EGFR ubiquitination, EGFR phosphorylation is also regulated by a negative feed-
back loop between EGFR and tyrosine phosphatases, such as SHP-1 (denoted generically as
PTP), which are activated by EGFR and induce receptor dephosphorylation and consequently
its inactivation (reactions 21 and 2).
Transcriptional positive feedback between PYK2 and STAT3
By using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase-reporter assay we previously
showed that STAT3 directly binds to PYK2 promoter and enhances its transcription in
response to EGF stimulation in TNBC cells. We further showed that STAT3 inhibition by Stat-
tic or AG490 (JAK/STAT3 inhibitor) significantly reduced PYK2 expression [16], and that
PYK2 enhances STAT3 phosphorylation on its primary activating tyrosine site (Y705) [16].
Together, these data established a transcriptional positive feedback loop between PYK2 and
STAT3, which is described by reactions 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11 in the model’s reaction scheme (Fig
1A) and by F2 in Fig 1B. Further, we showed that EGF stimulation of MDA-MB-468 cells, as
opposed of PYK2-depleted cells induced co-localization of EGFR with phospho-STAT3
(pY705) at endosomal-like structures [12], implying that PYK2 is essential for EGFR-STAT3
interaction. The association between PYK2, EGFR and STAT3 was further confirmed by co-

 immunoprecipitation studies [12]. Consequently, the EGFR-PYK2-STAT3 interactions are
modelled as a sequential cascade of signalling activation, as shown in Fig 1A.
Positive feedback between PYK2 and c-Met via STAT3
We previously showed that PYK2 positively regulates the steady-state level of c-Met protein as
well as its transcription in response to EGF stimulation in TNBC cells [16]. We also showed
that inhibition of c-Met using a specific inhibitor (PHA-665752) reduced the phosphorylation
of both PYK2 and STAT3 in response to EGFR stimulation [16], while STAT3 inhibition
decreased c-Met transcription, suggesting that STAT3 enhances the transcription of c-Met
(reaction 13). Together, our model (i) suggests a positive feedback loop in the PYK2-STAT3-c-
Met axis (F4 and F3 in Fig 1B) and (ii) incorporates the degradation of c-Met by Cbl-mediated
ubiquitination [19] (reaction 16).
Model implementation and calibration
Model inputs, outputs and formulation.
Binding of HGF to c-Met induces c-Met phos-
phorylation of two tyrosine residues (Y1234 and Y1235) within the catalytic loop of the tyro-
sine kinase domain [20], and the subsequent recruitment of effector proteins including growth
factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) and Src homology-2-containing (SHC) [20] which
leads to activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signalling cascade [21]. To keep the model mini-
mal without compromising its dynamic accuracy, we simplified this multi-step signalling cas-
cade into a single lumped reaction where ERK phosphorylation and activation are catalysed by
both EGFR and c-Met (reaction 23). We assumed EGF and HGF as inputs into the model,
while activities of STAT3 and ERK indicated by their phosphorylated levels are considered as
the main model outputs, which together regulate cancer cell proliferation and survival [12,16].
We integrated all the essential molecular interactions and feedback regulation described
above, based on which an ODE model was formulated using a combination of kinetic laws
including Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics for catalytic reactions (e.g. (de)phosphorylation,
(de)ubiquitination), Hill kinetics (transcription) and mass-action kinetics (association/ disso-
ciation) [22–24]. As a result, the model comprises 13 ODEs and 70 kinetic parameters. Full
description of the model reactions, ODE equations and parameters is given in S1 & S2 Tables.
Model calibration and kinetic parameters estimation.
The adequacy of a model is gen-
erally justified by its ability to recapitulate experimental data. Thus, to ensure model quality we
calibrated (trained) the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met model using time-course and perturbation data
obtained from TNBC MDA-MB-468 cells. These include the dynamic response of phosphory-
lated and total levels of key network components (EGFR, PYK2, c-Met, ERK and STAT3) fol-
lowing EGF stimulation (Fig 1C–1G). While EGF stimulation monotonically increased the
activities of EGFR, ERK and STAT3, it instead induced a biphasic response of c-Met where c-
Met level was initially decreased but then dramatically increased beyond its basal level (Fig
1G). In addition, time-course profiles of PYK2 and c-Met mRNA measured over 8 hours (Fig
1H–1J), and of pSTAT3, pERK1/2, c-Met and PYK2 measured over 2 hours (24 hours for c-
Met) following EGF stimulation in control and PYK2-deficient cells (Fig 1K–1R) were used
for model training. Finally, data regarding the effect of c-Met inhibition on signalling nodes
were also used (S1A and S1B Fig).
Model calibration involved the estimation of unknown model parameters using a global
parameter estimation method called genetic algorithm [22,25–27] implemented in Matlab and
run in parallel on high-performance supercomputers at Monash University (see Methods for
details). Model simulations using the optimal parameter values successfully recapitulated the
observed network dynamics demonstrated by the strong agreement between model

 simulations and quantified data (Fig 1C–1T), as well as by a quantitative assessment (S2 Fig
and S1 Text). The fitted model also accurately captured the intricate detail involving the
biphasic dynamics of EGF-induced c-Met expression (Fig 1G). Moreover, additional indepen-
dent simulations have further validated the model’s predictive capability. Specifically, simula-
tion results of constitutive STAT3 activation qualitatively recapitulated the corresponding
experiment data not used in training (S1C and S1D Fig). Together, these analyses demonstrate
that the model is predictive and could be used to make new predictions.
Identification and predictive ranking of synergistic drug combinations
While synergistic drug combinations have been identified for different cancers, most combina-
tions rely on empirical observations or expensive drug or siRNA/shRNA/CRISPR based
screens that lack mechanistic anchoring and scalability [28–31]. As our calibrated EGFR-
cMET-PYK2 model recapitulated the experimental data, we asked whether it can identify and
prioritize synergistic drug combinations.
To this end, we considered EGFR, PYK2, c-Met and STAT3 as four potential targets with
associated small-molecule inhibitors: Gefitinib, PF396, EMD and Stattic, respectively, and six dif-
ferent pair-wise combinations between them: Gefitinib+PF396, Gefitinib+Stattic, Gefitinib
+EMD, PF396+EMD, PF396+Stattic and Stattic+EMD. To analyse the effects of these drug com-
binations on cell signalling, we simulated the steady-state levels of pERK and pSTAT3 in response
to the individual drugs alone or in combinations, at their corresponding IC25 levels. ICX is
defined as the concentration at which a drug inhibits a signalling output (e.g. pERK/pSTAT3) by
X% (X = 0–100) compared to the untreated condition (see S3 Fig). Model simulations showed
that while single-drug treatments only modestly suppressed pERK/pSTAT3, the combined treat-
ments produced greater-than-additive effects for co-inhibition of EGFR-PYK2 or EGFR-c-Met,
while this is much less pronounced for co-inhibition of c-Met-STAT3 or PYK2-STAT3 (Fig 2A
and 2B). Similar simulations were also observed when we varied the applied drug concentrations
by using different IC values (S4 Fig), showing their consistency. Together, these simulations pre-
dicted varying levels of efficacy for different drug combinations, among which co-inhibition of
EGFR and PYK2 and EGFR and c-Met seemed to yield effects significantly better than additive.
However, greater-than-additive effects do not necessarily indicate drug synergy. Thus, to
systematically and quantitatively evaluate the level of synergism of the considered drug pairs,
we employed different methods to calculate the levels of drug synergy (Chou-Talalay’s Combi-
nation Index, (CI score) [32], Bliss Independence (BI score) [33] and Coefficient of Drug
Interaction (CDI score) [34], see Methods and S2 Text for details). Synergy scores <1, = 1 or
>1 indicate synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects, respectively; with the magnitude of
synergism/antagonism signified by how much smaller/larger they are compared to 1. As
shown in Fig 2C, our model predicted a strong synergy between Gefitinib and PF396 or
EMD, indicated by the CI scores much less than 1 for both pERK and pSTAT3 as outputs.
In contrast, the CI scores for the combinations EMD-Stattic and PF396-Stattic are marginally
different to 1 for both pERK and pSTAT3, indicating these drug pairs are unlikely to yield syn-
ergistic effects. In addition, co-targeting EGFR-STAT3 (by Gefitinib+Stattic) was predicted to
be mostly additive, while co-targeting c-Met-PYK2 (by EMD+PF396) was slightly synergistic,
which is more pronounced for pERK than pSTAT3. Importantly, these simulations were con-
sistent between different synergy computational methods (see S6 and S7 Figs for BI and CDI
scores). As pERK and pSTAT3 are major regulators of cell growth and survival, our simula-
tions collectively led us to hypothesize that drug combinations that co-target EGFR-PYK2,
EGFR-c-Met or PYK2-c-Met may yield synergistic effects in inhibiting TNBC growth, while
those co-targeting STAT3 with either c-Met or PYK2 are unlikely to induce synergy.

 To experimentally validate model predictions, we exposed TNBC MDA-MB-468 cells to
increasing levels of Gefitinib, PF396, EMD, and Stattic in six combinations, and measured the
effects on cell viability using the MTT assay and colony formation assay (Fig 2D and 2E and S8
Fig). To mitigate possible off-target effects (e.g. PF396 is known to also inhibit FAK), we
aimed to use minimal drug concentrations sufficient to suppress downstream signalling. The
combination index values (CI) were then calculated (CompuSyn software, CompuSyn. Inc)
and synergistic (CI < 1), additive (CI = 1), and antagonistic (CI > 1) effects were defined.
As shown, the experimental data supported our predictions, and indicate that Gefitinib
+PF396 was the most synergistic combination, followed by Gefitinib+EMD and Gefitinib+-
Stattic, whereas combined treatments of EMD+Stattic and PF396+Stattic did not show syner-
gistic effects but mildly antagonistic (Fig 2D and 2E). Consistent with these results, we have
recently showed that co-targeting of EGFR and PYK2 substantially reduced the growth of
basal-like TNBC cells both in vitro and in animal models, and further showed that this drug
combination is more potent than dual inhibition of EGFR and c-Met [12]. Taken together,
these results suggest that our model not only accurately predicted synergistic drug combina-
tions, but also correctly prioritized and ranked them according their efficacy, and thus, could
be applied for selecting best drug combinations for clinical testing.
Model-based analysis of dynamic network response to drug treatments
Although the above drug combinations had synergistic effects, it was unclear why the steady-
state activities of ERK and STAT3 were only marginally suppressed by single-drug treatments
but markedly reduced by the combinations (Fig 2A and 2B). To investigate this we focused on
EGFR-PYK2 co-targeting, and utilized the model to simulate the time-dependent signalling
responses to EGF stimuli in the absence or presence of Gefitinib, PF396 or both. Interestingly,
model simulations showed that although ERK activity was rapidly inhibited by Gefitinib as a
single-drug treatment, the inhibition was transient and pERK bounced back at 24 hr (Fig 3A).
The combined Gefitinib + PF396 treatment, however, abolished this late pERK recovery.
Moreover, simulations showed that Gefitinib have similar bounce-back effects on pSTAT3,
albeit the latency time caused by single-drug treatment (duration of brief suppression) were
slightly different to that of pERK (Fig 3B). Similarly, model simulations suggest that single-
drug treatment with PF396 alone did not efficiently suppress pERK/pSTAT3 compared to the
combination, inducing a slight recovery of pERK at 24 hr and a transient response in pSTAT3
(Fig 3A and 3B).
To validate these predictions, we stimulated MDA-MB-468 cells with EGF in the absence
or presence of Gefitinib, PF396 or both, and assessed the protein and phosphorylation levels of
the key signalling nodes of the EGFR-c-Met-PYK2 network over 24 hours (Fig 3C, quantified
in S10A and S10B Fig). Active EGFR and PYK2 phosphorylations were strongly inhibited
under Gefitinib (1μM) and PF396 (4μM) treatment, respectively, indicating these drugs acted
on the desired targets (see also S11 Fig). Consistent with model simulations, the experimental
data indeed reproduced the predicted late bounce back of both pERK and pSTAT3 in response
to Gefitinib treatment alone (Fig 3C, 2nd column), but not to the combined treatment (Fig 3C,
right column). The drug combination markedly outperformed both drugs as single-agent
treatment in long-term suppression of ERK/STAT3 (Fig 3F and 3G), consistent with model
predictions (Fig 3D and 3E). Moreover, PF396 treatment alone did not significantly affect
ERK activity, and induced a transient response of pSTAT3 which is in accordance with previ-
ous simulations. Interestingly, further simulations predicted that the dynamic patterns of ERK
and STAT response depend on PF396 dosage, with late bounce back of pERK appearing at
lower PF396 concentration, accompanying a disappearance of the transient pSTAT3 response

 (S10C and S10D Fig). Treating MDA-MB-468 cells with a lower PF396 concentration indeed
confirmed these predictions (S10E–S10G Fig). Together, these simulations and experimental
data suggest that Gefitinib and PF396 as single agents failed to induce durable inhibition of
ERK/STAT3 activation, while their co-treatment blocked the late bounce back of these onco-
genic signals, and thus resulting in synergistic effects.

late response of pERK/pSTAT3 re-activation, we systematically perturbed each feedback loop
(F1-F4) in silico. Interestingly, the late pERK response induced by Gefitinib was controlled by
the PYK2-STAT3-c-Met positive feedback loop (F3/F4), while F1 and F2 had relatively minor
influence (Fig 3H, quantified in Fig 3L). In contrast, feedback perturbations did not seem to
significantly affect the magnitude of the PF396-induced ERK response as well as its latency
time (Fig 3I and 3M). For pSTAT3 as a readout, F2/F3/F4 significantly regulate its late
response caused by both Gefitinib and PF396, while F1 had no effect (Fig 3J and 3K, quantified
in Fig 3N and 3O). These results suggest that EGFR inhibition in combination with interfer-
ence of the PYK2-c-Met positive feedback loop (F3/F4) and thus PYK2 or c-Met inhibition,
synergistically block ERK activation, as we predicted (Fig 2C) and supported by experimental
data (Fig 2D and 2E).
Overall, these results demonstrate the power of our kinetic model in precisely predicting
the time-dependent responses of network dynamics to drug treatments. The model-based
analyses helped to identify the dynamic molecular features that underlie the re-activation of
survival signals and to prioritize synergistic combinations.
Switch-like signalling and phenotypic switches mediate drugs synergy
Simulations of our calibrated model showed that pERK/pSTAT3 responded in a switch-like
manner to increasing concentrations of EGF or HGF (S9 Fig). As switch-like responses are
often emerged from a combination of positive and negative feedback regulation [35,36], we
examined the possible link between the degree of switch-like response and drugs synergy in
our model system. Simulation of the 3-dimensional (3D) dose-responses of pERK/STAT3 to
increasing concentrations of individual drugs using the six drug pairs applied earlier (Fig 4A
and 4B and S12 Fig), clearly showed a highly switch-like response landscapes of both pERK
and pSTAT3 to concurrent changes of Gefitinib and PF396 (Fig 4A and 4B). As shown, each
individual drug (blue dot) slightly inhibited the signal outputs compared to control (black
dot), while intermediate doses of the combined drugs dramatically pushed the output toward
the bottom of this steep landscape (red dot), generating a cooperative effect. Importantly, the
three other predicted synergistic combinations: Gefitinib + PF396, Gefitinib + EMD and Gefi-
tinib + Stattic, but not the non-synergistic combinations (PF396 + EMD, Stattic + EMD,
PF396 + Stattic; S12 Fig), also displayed switch-like responses (Fig 4A and 4B and S12 Fig) for
the two signalling output pERK and pSTAT3. These analyses reveal a link between switch-like
behaviour of drug responses and drug cooperativity.
Importantly, we confirmed these switch-like responses also by 2D dose-response simula-
tions of Gefitinib and PF396 (Fig 4D and 4E). In addition, these simulations suggest that
pSTAT3 is more sensitive to both drugs than pERK, indicated by a shift to the left of its dose-
results. (d-e) Simulation data of steady-state pERK and pSTAT3 levels in response to single-drug and combined treatment of Gefitinib and PF396 for 24h. (f-g)

 response curves (blue vs red, Fig 4D and 4E). To verify these predictions, we exposed MDA-
MB-468 (Fig 4C and 4H and 4I) and BT-20 (Fig 4J and 4K) cells to increasing concentrations
of either Gefitinib or PF396 and assessed their impact on ERK and STAT3 phosphorylation
(Fig 4C) and on cell growth (Fig 4H–4K). As shown, pERK and pSTAT3 responded in a
switch-like fashion to increasing Gefitinib, being high at low doses but jumping to significantly
lower levels at higher doses of Gefitinib (Fig 4F). pSTAT3 was more sensitive to both drugs
compared to pERK as correctly predicted (Fig 4D and 4E). Furthermore, the switches detected
at the signalling level were also translated into switch-like behaviour at the cell growth level in
both TNBC cell lines; further demonstrating the power of our predicted modelling (Fig 4H
and 4J) [12].

 Further model simulations predicted that Gefitinib can sensitize the cells to PF396 and vice
versa, as evident by a left shift in the dose-response curves and the lower IC50 values (S13A–
S13C Fig and S13G–S13I Fig). These predictions were confirmed by experimental data dem-
onstrating that Gefitinib treatment indeed sensitized TNBC cells to PF396 (S13D and S13E
Fig, red vs. blue curves), and reduced the IC50 of PF396 in both cell lines (S13F Fig). Similarly,
knockdown of PYK2 by shRNA markedly sensitized MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 to Gefitinib
(S13J–S13L Fig).
Together, our combined analysis revealed a switch-like pattern as a feature of the steady-
state response profiles of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network, and further demonstrated the link
between cell proliferation-associated switch-like response and drug synergy, implying that a
similar response pattern in other signalling networks could be used to predict drugs synergy.
Analysis of feedback loops underlying switch-like behaviours
Although positive feedback is known to drive switch-like responses in biological systems
[35,36], the fact that the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network is governed by several positive feedback
mechanisms (F1-4) led us to seek for the predominant feedback(s) in drug-induced switch-
like features via systematic feedback perturbation analysis (Fig 5A), focusing on the Gefitinib
+PF396 drug combination.
Switch-like dose-response curves can be quantitatively characterized by fitting the curves to a
Hill function where the Hill coefficient and IC50 value signify the curve steepness (sigmoidality)
and the sensitivity to the inhibiting drugs, respectively (Fig 5B and S14 Fig) [37,38] (see Methods
for details). Interestingly, proportionally equal perturbations of the feedback loops did not result
in equivalent changes in the dose-response profiles. F4 exerted strongest control as its disruption
significantly shifted these curves to the left with reduced sigmoidality, as evidenced by lower
IC50 and Hill coefficient values, particularly for pSTAT3 as output (Fig 5D–5K). This suggests
F4 strongly promotes the switch-like response of STAT3 to both Gefitinib and PF396. Con-
versely, F1 was found to have little impact on all dose-response curves, indicating this feedback
plays a minor role in shaping these switches. In addition, we found the pSTAT3 switches are also
sensitive to F2 blockage, while the pERK switches are slightly sensitive to F3 disruption instead.
Next, we asked if these feedback links influence the synergy between Gefitinib and PF396.
Thus we re-evaluated the synergy indexes (BI and CDI values) with respect to pERK and
pSTAT3 under similar feedback perturbations. Shown in Fig 5L–5O, disruption of F2 and par-
ticularly F4 dramatically increased the BI/CDI values for both signalling outputs, suggesting
these links strongly promote the drugs’ synergistic effect. Together, these results reveal F4 as a
key feedback link that promotes both switch-like behaviour and drug synergy, further support-
ing a connection between these entities.
Model-based stratification of patients identifies subgroups benefiting from
combinatorial therapies
We next exploited our model to predictively stratify TNBC patients into subgroups who may
or may not benefit from a certain drug combination, focusing on the EGFR-PYK2 co-inhibi-
tion as an example. To this end, we developed a general computational pipeline to generate
patient-specific models using patient data, and compute the level of predicted synergy towards
a chosen drug combination in each patient using their corresponding model (Fig 6). Sorting
the patients by the predicted synergy levels allows us to group them into subgroups displaying
different levels of response to the combination, thereby stratifying the patients. Furthermore,
differential expression analysis across these subgroups enables the identification of potential
molecular patterns that differentially characterize these subgroups (Fig 6, right).

into subgroups based on Vanderbilt subtyping (left panel). The sample data is normalized by the median value of the BL subtype (see text for details), which is
then incorporated in the network model to generate patient-specific network models (middle panel). Simulations using patient specific models predict synergic
effect by Gefitinib plus PF396 co-treatment. Patients are sorted according to the predicted synergy (right panel). Subgroups comprising highly synergistic (Q1)

(biomarkers) that characterize these subgroups.

 We first obtained protein and gene expression data from a TNBC cohort (called the ‘discov-
ery cohort’) containing 108 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas project [39] (see Materi-
als & Methods for details). Using the Vanderbilt-based subtyping system [40], the patients
were classified into different subgroups: Basal-Like (BL1/2), Mesenchymal (M), Luminal
Androgen Receptor (LAR), and unclassified (UNC). Examining the mutation profiles of these
patients showed that the patient heterogeneity primarily comes from variation in expression
levels of the network nodes rather than point mutation events (S6 Table). As our model was
constructed based on the MDA-MB-468 cell line previously aligned to the Basal-Like (BL1)
TNBC subtype (18), expression data from each patient was normalised by the median values
of the BL1 patient subgroup (Fig 6, left). This normalisation step allowed us to tailor the cell-
based model for each patient by adjusting the expression levels of the model species according
to the normalised fold change. For instance, if a patient displays a two-fold increase in EGFR
expression, then the EGFR abundance is doubled in the model describing that patient. This
procedure was followed for all the model components resulting in 108 personalized kinetic
models of the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network (see Materials & Methods for more details). Note
that an alternative normalisation strategy where we normalised all the patients against a patient
whose expression profile most closely resembles that of the MDA-MB-468 cell line did not
change the results’ main conclusions (S18 and S19 Figs). Using these patient-specific models,
we next computed the predicted synergy levels of the Gefitinib+PF396 combination using the
BI scores for each patient, which were then used to rank the patients, allowing identification of
patient subgroups with different susceptibility to the co-treatment. To enhance the prediction
accuracy of drug synergy, we excluded patients who did not respond at all to either drug when
treated alone as informed by simulations.
As shown in Fig 7, the network nodes exhibit highly heterogeneous expression patterns across
different TNBC subtypes within the discovery cohort (Fig 7A and 7C, top, and S18 Fig). Interest-
ingly, computation of the drug synergy index showed that patients displaying potent or weak
synergistic effects towards ERK (or STAT3) inhibition were found in all subtypes (Fig 7A and
7C, bottom & S19 Fig). Moreover, the synergy index did not show any significant statistical dif-
ferences between the subtypes (S16 Fig), suggesting classical TNBC subtypes may not be suffi-
cient to predict the synergy of the Gefitinib+PF396 co-treatment. Next, we sorted the patients by
the synergy index (Fig 7B for pERK as output and Fig 7D for pSTAT3) and identified a highly
‘synergistic subgroup’ (termed Q1) and a ‘non-synergistic subgroup’ (Q3), containing patients
having the synergy index values < the lower quartile and > the upper quartile, respectively. Dif-
ferential expression analysis revealed that PYK2 was significantly upregulated in Q1 compared
to Q3, which were consistent for both pERK and pSTAT3 as outputs (Fig 7E and 7F). To validate
these findings, we additionally performed the patient stratification analysis on a second, inde-
pendent patient cohort (‘validation cohort’, described in Materials & Methods). Consistent with
the discovery cohort, model simulations predicted PYK2 is significantly upregulated in the syn-
ergistic patient group (S17 Fig). Taken together, these results suggest that upregulation of PYK2
could serve as indicators of susceptibility to treatments co-targeting EGFR-PYK2.
Discussion
Kinases are the largest class of cancer therapeutic targets, yet most tumours can escape from
the inhibition of any single kinase [14,15]. Although combination therapies targeting multiple
kinases have become necessary to effectively combat cancer, it remains a major challenge to
identify the best combinations and most susceptible patients for clinical testing. However,
drug combination identification based on experimental screening techniques remains costly
and often identify only small numbers of synergistic combinations, which motivates

 development of alternative computational approaches for the task. Notably, an open challenge
was recently launched by the DREAM consortium to computationally predict pair-wise drug
synergy in human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [41], resulting in over 30 community-gener-
ated algorithms, several of which performed significantly better than random guessing. Most
were statistical methods but an ODE-based kinetic modeling approach was also proposed [41].
While the accuracy of the predictions were suboptimal, these efforts strongly demonstrate that
computational prediction of drug synergy is feasible and can be useful in advancing the devel-
opment of effective therapeutic strategies. Here, we address the same challenge by employing a
systems approach that integrates mechanistic kinetic modelling with experimental validation
in an iterative manner. Focusing on the EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network in TNBC as a
model system, we demonstrated the significant potential of this integrative approach in the
rational identification and prioritization of synergistic drug combinations, as well as predictive
stratification of patients for optimal benefit from these combinations. The strength of this
approach further lies in its flexibility and scalability where the presented principles and
computational frameworks could be reused and adapted to investigate similar questions in
other systems and/or other tumour types beyond TNBC.
Model predictions validated by in vitro experimental data showed that EGFR-PYK2 co-tar-
geting yields most synergistic effect in basal-like TNBC cell lines among other possible combi-
nations, followed by EGFR-c-Met co-targeting. Indeed, previous studies suggest that
combined targeting of both EGFR and c-Met receptors could be an effective therapeutic strat-
egy for TNBC [42], and have reported in vivo data supporting synergy in co-inhibition of
EGFR-c-Met [43–45]. In addition, our recent results further demonstrated the potent synergis-
tic effect of EGFR and PYK2/FAK co-targeting on basal-like TNBC [12]. While these experi-
mental data were obtained both in vitro and in vivo using TNBC cell lines and xenograft
mouse models, respectively, the systems approach described here, using a quantitative model-
ling of EGFR-PYK2-c-Met interaction network in TNBC, precisely predicted the outcome
results and the obtained synergistic effects of the combined treatments. Not only our model-
based analysis could identify highly synergistic target combinations, we also uncovered non-
synergistic (antagonistic) combinations for TNBC, such as c-Met-STAT3 or PYK2-STAT3 co-
targeting, that is also valuable in informing subsequent studies. While EGFR-PYK2 co-target-
ing was identified to be synergistic in TNBC, PYK2 may have a larger role in coordinating
EGFR and c-MET signalling depending on the cancer types, evident by data showing PYK2
activation was not affected by Gefitinib in lung cancer cells [46]. Thus, the presence of drug
synergy may be context specific and therefore should be treated accordingly.
Although effective drug combinations are being identified in many cancers, most resulted
from empirical observations and/or expensive experimental screens [28–31] that frequently
lack mechanistic anchoring, making it difficult to predict if the identified combinations may
work in different biological contexts (and so patients). This issue is similarly faced by
machine-learning or statistical based computational approaches aimed to predict effective drug
combinations [47–49]. In contrast, our modelling captures the mechanistic details contained
within the interaction network under study. Thus, it allowed us to link the molecular and
network model (lower panels) are depicted. Only patients displaying sensitivity to Gefitinib and PF396 alone are included for synergy
analysis (i.e. 44 and 61 patients for pERK and pSTAT3 as readouts, respectively). IC50 concentrations were used for each drug. (a-b)

 dynamic network features with observed drug synergy. Indeed, time-dependent simulations
backed up by experiments helped reveal that while inhibition of EGFR or PYK2 alone (by Gefi-
tinib or PF396, respectively) only temporarily suppressed the activities of ERK/STAT3 which
were subsequently restored to basal levels; this activity recovery was abolished by the combined
treatment. This finding suggests that knowledge of drug synergy could be gained by under-
standing and exploiting the dynamic behaviour of signalling networks. We further found that
the signalling and phenotypic switches mediated primarily by the positive feedbacks within the
EGFR-PYK2-c-Met network contributed to the synergistic effects between Gefitinib and PF396.
Importantly, feedback perturbation analysis unveiled that the PYK2-controlled feedback loops
play crucial roles in mediating the signal restoration of ERK and STAT3. This analysis also
helped pinpoint the PYK2-c-Met positive feedback loops as a critical regulator of the switches
as well as drug synergy. These findings highlight the utilities of our mechanistic model in eluci-
dating a systems-level understanding of drug-induced network dynamics and mechanisms that
underlie monotherapy resistance as well as synergistic effects by drug combination.
The heterogeneous nature of TNBC is thought to underlie the sporadic and low response
rates to targeted agents [50,51]. However, effective strategy in order to improve patient stratifi-
cation is strongly lacking. While the expression or mutation status of the drug targets can
inform drug response, these are not always sufficient [52] particularly in the context of multi-
target inhibition, possibly because these biomarkers do not capture the mechanistic connec-
tion between the targets. We provided a proof-of-concept demonstration of the prognostic
significance of our modelling by showing its ability in stratifying patients into subgroups
exhibiting different susceptibility for a certain combination treatment through generation of
patient-specific models utilizing patient-specific data. As an example, this enabled prediction
of two patient subgroups, one highly susceptible to EGFR-PYK2 co-targeting and one least
likely to benefit from the same combination. Importantly, differential expression analysis
revealed upregulation of PYK2 was particularly enriched in the highly responsive subgroup,
consistent between two independent patient cohorts analysed. Interestingly, upregulation of
EGFR was not predicted to be significantly enriched in this group, however this finding was
not surprising given that high EGFR expression is not always predictive of sensitivity to
EGFR-directed inhibition [53]. These results support the notion that network-based biomark-
ers, rather than expression of the drug target, could offer better sensitivity indicator for drugs
co-targeting. While the patient stratification analyses here were mainly focused on the EGFR-
PYK2 co-inhibition, the patient-specific models could be utilised to discover new drug combi-
nations in each patient for personalized therapies. Moreover, as our models were primarily
kinases based, future availability of high-resolution proteomic data from patients instead of
transcriptomic data would potentially further enhance model predictability.
In summary, our systems modelling presents a powerful and highly adaptable approach for
the rational design and predictive prioritization of combinatorial therapies in an individual-
ized manner, providing a concrete step towards personalized treatment for TNBC and other
cancers. Given the space of possible drug combinations is vast while clinical trials are slow and
costly, this predictive approach opens exciting avenues for drug repurposing and quick transla-
tion of combination therapies into the clinic.

Cell culture
MDA-MB-468 and BT-20 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA, 2013–2015).
MDA-MB-468 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL; Grand Island, NY, US). BT-20
cells were grown in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (MEM-Eagle’s) supplemented with 1
mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM L-glutamine. All media preparations were supplemented
with a penicillin–streptomycin mixture (100 U ml−1; 0.1 mg ml−1; Beit Haemek, Israel) and
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, US). Cell lines were verified to be
mycoplasma negative. The two cell lines’ identities were verified by the provider by STR profil-
ing every 6 months. Cells were expanded and subsequently stored in liquid nitrogen upon pur-
chase. Original vials have only been passaged for not more than two months.
Induction experiments and western blot analysis
To induce downstream signalling of EGFR, cells were stimulated with EGF (100 ng ml−1) for
30 min–24 h upon serum starvation (0.5% FCS) for 24 h. Phospho- and total protein levels
were examined by western blotting (WB) which is described elsewhere.
Dose response experiments
To investigate the changes in downstream signalling upon kinase inhibition cells were treated
with several concentrations of inhibitor for 24 h and analysed by WB.
IC50 values and drug synergism
IC50 values and drug synergism experiments were performed as described before [55]. In
short, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with increasing concentrations of one
inhibitor for determination of IC50 values or in a dose matrix for determining the synergy indi-
ces (based on CI score using the Chou-Talalay method) for drug combinations. 72h after treat-

 incubated with medium containing MTT reagent (0.5 mg ml−1; Sigma) for 2 h at 37˚C and
then lysed in lysis solution containing 0.4% NP-40 in 0.04 mol l−1 HCl-isopropanol. Absor-
bance was measured at 570 nm and at 620 nm (reference wavelength), and cell viability was
depicted as percentage of untreated control cells. Data is represented as the mean values of
three independent biological replicates.
Western blotting
Western blot analysis was performed as described previously [56,57]. Briefly, cells were
extracted in cold lysis buffer (0.1% Triton-X-100, 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM
MgCl2, 50 mM NaF, 0.5 mM NaVO3, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulpho-
nyl fluoride, 10 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 10 μg ml−1 aprotinin) and centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. for
15 min at 4˚C. Protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
and equal protein amounts (30 μg) were analysed by WB following SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. ImageJ software (NIH, USA) was used to perform densitometric analysis.
Mathematical model implementation, calibration and numerical
simulation
Implementation. The mathematical model was formulated using ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) and implemented in MATLAB (The MathWorks. Inc. 2016b). The model is
also available in the standard SMBL format as part of this paper. All model simulations and
analyses were performed using MATLAB. The ODE system was integrated and solved using
the ode15s function in MATLAB, which is a variable-step and variable-order solver based on
the numerical differentiation formulas (NDFs), and is specially designed for stiff systems.
Calibration.
MATLAB’s Global Optimization toolbox was employed for model calibra-
tion and parameter estimation (see S1 Text for details). Specifically, a genetic algorithm [27]
was used to find the optimal model parameter values that minimize the discrepancy between
model simulations and the training datasets, by minimizing the following aggregated objective
function:
MðpÞ ¼ JðpÞ þ
X

i¼1
RiðpÞ;

where JðpÞ ¼

is the cost function (detail given in S1 Text); and Ri(p)s rep-
resent the algebraic constraints described in the S5 Table.
Genetic algorithms are powerful methods to solve both constrained and unconstrained
optimization problems based on a natural selection process that mimics biological evolution
[58,59]. The algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions. At each step,
the genetic algorithm creates new individuals using crossover and mutation as well as selection
of best individuals from the current population, and uses them as parents to produce the off-
spring for the next generation. Over successive generations, the population ‘evolves’ toward an
optimal solution. Model fitting (parameter estimation) was performed using high-perfor-
mance computing facilities at Monash University (http://www.monash.edu), consisting of two
Haswell CPU sockets with a total of 16 physical cores (or 32 hyperthreaded cores) at 3.20 GHz
and 300 TB usable storage.
Patient-specific models.
Detailed description of patient-specific model generation is
given in S3 Text. Patient-derived expression data (combining RPPA and RNA-seq based
expression data) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used as inputs to tailor the cell-

 based model for each patient and generate the patient-specific models. For instance, if a patient
displays a two-fold increase in EGFR expression, then the EGFR abundance is doubled in the
model describing that patient. This procedure was followed for all the model components. For
components that are not conserved (i.e. subject to synthesis/degradation) including PYK2 and
c-Met, their mRNA levels were adjusted by modifying the corresponding kinetic parameter
(synthetic and degradation rates) values (Vs5 and kdeg6 for PYK2 mRNA, and Vs13 and
kdeg14 for c-Met mRNA) based on implicit reverse functions such that these mRNA levels
reflect the fold change of gene expression in each patient (see S20 Fig). The form of these func-
tions: Y = f(ks,kd) (where Y, ks and kd denote the mRNA level, synthetic and degradation rate,
respectively) was obtained numerically through model simulations (S20 Fig).
Model-based computation of drug synergy indexes
Different drug synergy scores were used to numerically evaluate drug combination effect:
The Chou-Talalay’s Combination Index, (CI score) [32], Bliss Independence (BI score) (28)
and Coefficient of Drug Interaction (CDI score) (29). Detailed description of these scores are
given in S2 Text.
Characterization of switch-like response
We adopted a Hill function to quantitatively characterize the switch-like features of the dose-
response curves as follows (see S14 Fig):
Y ¼ ymax � ymin
1 þ
I
IC50
�
�H þ ymin;
ð2Þ
where Y is a model readout (i.e., pERK or pSTAT3) and ymax and ymin are the maximum and
minimum value of Y. I denotes the drug (Gefitinib and PF396). IC50 denotes the half-maximal
concentration and H is the Hill coefficient.
Data acquisition and processing for the patient stratification
A discovery patient cohort and an independent validation cohort were used for the patient
stratification analyses. The former was obtained from The Broad Institute TCGA GDAC Fire-
hose (gdac.broadinstitute.org), containing 108 patients with both patient-specific transcrip-
tomic (RNA-seq) and proteomic (Reverse Phase Protein Array, RPPA) data for some proteins.
As RPPA data was not available for all network nodes (state variables), RPPA data for selected
nodes (EGFR, ERK and STAT3) were used in combination with gene expression data for the
remaining nodes (PYK2, c-Met and CBL). The discovery cohort data (N = 108) was subclassi-
fied into different subtypes (Basal-Like1 (BL1, 34), Mesenchymal (M, 34), Luminal Androgen
Receptor (LAR, 26), and unclassified (UNC, 1)) using the Vanderbilt subtyping system [40].
The independent cohort for validation was obtained from the European-Genome Phenome
Archive (accession number EGAS00001001178) [60], consisting of 75 TNBC patient samples
that were further subclassified into different subtypes (Basal-like 1 (BL1, 8), Basal-like 2 (BL2,
5), Immunomodulatory (IM, 16), mesenchymal stem-like (MSL, 6), Mesenchymal (M, 17),
Luminal Androgen Receptor (LAR, 2), unspecified (UNS, 10) [40]. Several patient samples
(PR11327a, PR11750a, PR4845a.RNA, PR4975a, PR5930a, PR5932a, PR5942a, PR6408a,
PR6722a and PR9758a) were removed from the validation cohort since the Vanderbilt subtyp-
ing system [40] indicates these are potentially ER-positive. Consequently, a total of 65 TNBC
patients were used for the validation cohort.

identified 10 patients who have reported mutations in any of the network nodes. Specifically,
four patients contain EGFR mutations, two contain PYK2 mutations, another two contain
STAT3 mutations, and Met and Cbl mutation were found in one single patient. The most
common mutation types are SNP. However, searching for these mutations in the COSMIC
mutation catalogue (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic), the most comprehensive mutation
database currently available, we found mostly no functional effects (i.e. GOF or LOF) reported
for these genetic changes, except that STAT3 H410R (indicated by an asterisk) is associated
with induction of STAT3 phosphorylation and SOCS3, CCL2, JUNB and BCL3 upregulation
in large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia [61]. Therefore, within the EGFR-PYK2-cMET
network, the majority of the considered TNBC patients displayed no functionally significant
mutation events. Rather, the heterogeneity of the patient landscape primarily comes from
