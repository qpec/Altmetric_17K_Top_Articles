Although there is little dispute about the impact of the US opioid
epidemic on recent mortality, there is less consensus about whether
trends reflect increasing despair among American adults. The issue
is complicated by the absence of established scales or definitions
of despair as well as a paucity of studies examining changes in
psychological health, especially well-being, since the 1990s. We
contribute evidence using two cross-sectional waves of the Midlife
in the United States (MIDUS) study to assess changes in measures of
psychological distress and well-being. These measures capture neg-
ative emotions such as sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness,
and positive emotions such as happiness, fulfillment, and life satis-
faction. Most of the measures reveal increasing distress and de-
creasing well-being across the age span for those of low relative
socioeconomic position, in contrast to little decline or modest im-
provement for persons of high relative position.

T
wo interrelated recent trends among American adults have
caught the attention of social scientists. One is the steady in-
crease since the late 1990s in substance abuse epitomized by the
opioid epidemic (1). This rise has been attributed to changes in
prescription practices, aggressive marketing by pharmaceutical firms,
nonmedical uses of opioids, and black market dissemination of drugs
that are cheaper yet more toxic than prescription opioids (1, 2). The
prevalence of alcohol use and related disorders appears to have
increased substantially over a similar period, although the evidence is
less consistent than for opioid use (3, 4). The second trend has been
stagnation, or in some instances increases, in death rates among
American adults since the late 1990s, particularly middle-aged whites
and persons of low socioeconomic status (5–7). These changes in
mortality likely resulted in no small part from the upsurge in sub-
stance abuse, as reflected by increases in deaths from drug and al-
cohol poisonings, suicide, and liver diseases over this timeframe.
Both of these trends have raised concerns about a potential
deterioration in the mental health of Americans, as underscored
by the now-popularized term “deaths of despair” to describe the
upturn in drug- and alcohol-related deaths and suicide (8–10).
Researchers have expended considerable effort to examine these
worrisome patterns in cause-specific mortality and their social
and economic underpinnings (6, 7, 11). However, scholars have
failed to undertake a broad examination of the psychological
health of Americans, one that goes beyond assessments of dis-
tress and depression, to determine whether “despair” has be-
come more widespread in recent years. In this paper, we provide
insights into this timely, yet underresearched, question.
The issue is admittedly complicated by the absence of estab-
lished scales to measure despair or even an agreed-upon defi-
nition. [We are aware of only two attempts to measure despair.
One measure was developed to capture regret and hopelessness
at the end of life (12, 13) and the other, the “behavioral ‘despair’
test,” to identify potential antidepressants by forcing rats to re-
main afloat in a small space (14). Neither measure is appropriate
for the present study.] Our approach is to assess changes since
the mid-1990s in psychological measures that we believe relate to
layman notions of despair and that are highly relevant to ongoing
discussions about substance use and associated increases in
mortality. Psychologists and other social scientists have in-
creasingly recognized that mental health is far more than the
absence of particular pathologies; positive and negative emotions
are distinct and essential dimensions of mental well-being rather
than simply polar opposites (15–17). Furthermore, there are two
overlapping but distinct philosophies of well-being: The hedonic
approach centers on happiness or pleasure, whereas the eudai-
monic approach focuses on self-actualization (18, 19). Thus, we
base our analysis on an extensive set of mental health measures
that capture both psychological distress and well-being. Psycho-
logical distress is assessed by measures of negative affect and
major depression. Well-being is evaluated by two measures of
hedonic well-being (positive affect and life satisfaction) and two
measures of eudaimonic well-being (psychological well-being
and social well-being). Of particular importance for our exami-
nation of trends is that all measures derive from comparable sets
of questions in two periods that cover the timeframe of interest.
Our objective is twofold. The first is to determine whether
mental health has deteriorated since the mid-1990s. The second
goal is to examine whether the observed changes are concen-
trated in the groups most likely to have experienced declines or
stagnation in survival over this time span, namely non-Latino
whites and persons of low income or little education (20, 21).
Researchers have raised concerns that mortality increases among
the less educated may simply reflect compositional changes: In-
dividuals with low levels of schooling are a smaller and more
disadvantaged group today than their counterparts were in the
mid-1990s (22, 23). Because of this potential selection bias, we
assess socioeconomic status (SES) with a composite measure
that takes into account education, occupation, income, and wealth
Significance
In the past few years, references to the opioid epidemic, drug
poisonings, and associated feelings of despair among Ameri-
cans, primarily working-class whites, have flooded the media,
and related patterns of mortality have been of increasing in-
terest to social scientists. Yet, despite recurring references to
distress or despair in journalistic accounts and academic stud-
ies, there has been little analysis of whether psychological
health among American adults has worsened over the past two
decades. Here, we use data from national samples of adults in
the mid-1990s and early 2010s to demonstrate increasing dis-
tress and declining well-being that was concentrated among
low-socioeconomic-status individuals but spanned the age
range from young to older adults.

 of the respondent as well as the spouse or partner if married; the
measure is calculated as a percentile rank in the SES distribution,
reflecting relative rather than absolute status.
We base our assessments on the two cross-sectional waves
of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. Because
MIDUS was developed to improve our understanding of factors
that underlie the well-being of American adults, it collected an
extensive set of measures of psychological and social health.
MIDUS conducted interviews with independent national sam-
ples of adults in 1995 to 1996 and again in 2011 to 2014, spanning
closely the period of rising substance abuse. We restrict the main
analysis to non-Latino whites (n = 4,627 for the combined
samples) not only because this group is most frequently impli-
cated in concerns about rising premature mortality and despair
but also because of sample size considerations.
Results
Descriptive statistics for the analysis variables indicate that re-
spondents ranged in age between 24 and 76 and slightly below
half of the sample was male (SI Appendix, Table S1). Mean
values for the six mental health measures are very similar be-
tween the two waves, which, as shown later, is largely a result
of counteracting changes at the low and high ends of the SES
distribution.
Estimated coefficients from the regression models (logit
models for the distress outcomes and linear models for the
remaining outcomes) are presented in Table 1. Of central in-
terest is the coefficient for survey wave, which reveals whether
mental health worsened between 1995 to 1996 and 2011 to 2014
for those in the bottom percentile of the SES distribution. The
interaction term between SES and survey wave, which captures
the extent to which changes in mental health varied across the
SES spectrum, is also of primary importance. Because of positive
skewness in the distributions, we dichotomized the two outcomes
of psychological distress so that the value of 1 denotes high
distress for both negative affect and depressive symptoms. The
remaining four outcomes are continuous standardized variables
(mean 0, SD 1), with higher values denoting greater well-being.
We anticipate opposite signs in the regression coefficients
between the two distress outcomes and the four well-being
measures for SES, survey wave, and the interaction between SES
and survey wave. The estimated coefficients for all six outcomes
confirm this expectation. The coefficients for SES are always
large, significant, and in the expected direction, signifying better
mental health for those of higher SES. The main effects for
survey wave consistently show a worsening of mental health for
those at the lowest SES percentile, although coefficients are
significant at P < 0.05 for only four of the outcomes (exceptions
are depression and social well-being). The interaction term be-
tween SES and period is significant for negative affect, positive
affect, and life satisfaction, indicating that deterioration in these
mental health outcomes diminishes as SES increases.
Because of the inclusion of interaction terms, it is difficult to
infer from the coefficients the extent to which mental health has
declined over the 15+ y of interest, overall and by SES. In Table
2, we present the predicted values (proportions or Z scores) for
relative SES at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles in
the two survey waves. The results highlight the social stratifica-
tion of mental health: Higher SES is consistently associated with
less distress and greater well-being. The effects are generally
substantial. For example, at the second wave, 37% of low-SES
individuals (10th percentile) are predicted to have high negative
affect, in contrast to only 8% of high-SES individuals (90th
percentile); for life satisfaction, psychological well-being, and social
well-being, there is about a 1-SD difference between the low- and
high-SES groups at the second wave (e.g., −0.55 − 0.38 = −0.93 for
psychological well-being).
To further facilitate comparisons over time, the estimates in
Table 2 are used to generate Fig. 1, which depicts the absolute
difference in predicted values between the two waves for the
10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of relative SES for the four
outcomes with significant main effects for survey wave. The

 estimates underscore the substantial widening of SES disparities
in mental health. For example, individuals at the 10th percentile
experienced an increase in the probability of high negative affect
of more than 0.10, a decrease in positive affect and life satis-
faction of about 0.3 SD, and a decrease of 0.16 SD in psycho-
logical well-being between 1995 to 1996 and 2011 to 2014. By
contrast, persons at the 90th percentile experienced virtually no
change in negative affect, a small decline in psychological well-
being, and improvements in positive affect and life satisfaction.
Because the models include interaction terms involving age,
we estimated predictions for ages 30, 50, and 70 (SI Appendix,
Fig. S1). The results for each age mirror those for the combined
sample. That is, the estimated increases in distress and decreases
in well-being have not been confined to those in midlife but in-
stead appear to have been pervasive across the life course, a
finding substantiated by the absence of significant interaction
terms between period and age across all outcomes.
We repeated the analysis using the models in Table 1, except
we replaced relative SES with the completed schooling cate-
gories used in many previous studies (5, 20, 22): high school
graduate or lower, some college, and college graduate or higher
(SI Appendix, Table S2). The estimates reveal similar patterns to
those for the SES index. For example, the main effect for survey
wave is significant (P < 0.05) for all outcomes except depression,
and the predicted values (SI Appendix, Table S3) show the
expected patterns by education and survey wave. However, only
one outcome (life satisfaction) has a significant interaction term
between survey wave and education, likely attributable to the
crude categorization of education (e.g., the lowest category
comprises 49% of the weighted sample in 1995 to 1996 and 39%
in 2011 to 2014) in contrast to the fine gradation of relative SES
(i.e., continuous values from the 1st to the 99th percentile).
The analysis so far has been restricted to non-Latino whites.
We reestimated the models in Table 1 on the full sample of
MIDUS respondents (n = 5,632), adding controls for race/eth-
nicity (SI Appendix, Table S4). The results remain essentially the
same. Although no outcome is significantly different between
Latinos and non-Latino whites, four outcomes (all but high
negative affect and life satisfaction) indicate significantly better
reported mental health for non-Latino blacks compared with
non-Latino whites. Unfortunately, the sample sizes of these
groups are too small to include interaction terms between race/
ethnicity and survey wave (n = 196 for Latinos and n = 365 for
non-Latino blacks in the pooled sample), a limitation which
prevents us from examining whether the worsening of psycho-
logical health has indeed been most severe for whites.
Discussion
Despite a recent focus on widening socioeconomic disparities in
life expectancy and associated trends in substance use and drug-
related deaths, few scholars have explored whether these patterns
are mirrored by changes in mental health (24). The few existing
studies have focused on negative emotions, primarily distress and
depression, and the findings have been inconsistent. Case and
Deaton (5) used the Kessler (K6) questionnaire of psychological
distress (equivalent to the measure of negative affect in MIDUS)
and a simple question on “days mental health was not good” to
suggest growing distress since the late 1990s, but their estimates
were restricted to non-Latino whites aged 45 to 54. In a study that
examined recent trends (2000 to 2015) in depression across a
broad age range, Weinberger et al. (25) found an overall increase
in the prevalence of depression among Americans, primarily at
the youngest and oldest ages. In a separate study among adults 18
and older, which used both the K6 scale and a structured interview
for depression, Mojtabai and Jorm (24) found little change in the
prevalence of either psychological distress or depression over a
similar timeframe (2001 to 2012).
In this paper, we address the issue more systematically and
comprehensively, by drawing on a broader set of measures of
psychological health derived from national samples of adults in
the mid-1990s and the early 2010s. We go beyond measures of
poor psychological health typically alluded to in discussions of
deaths of despair to consider well-being alongside distress. The
two measures of distress in this study (negative affect and
depression) capture emotions such as sadness, hopelessness,
worthlessness, loss of interest, and feeling down. By contrast, the
two indexes of hedonic well-being (positive affect and life satis-
faction) capture opposing emotions such as happiness, fulfill-
ment, and satisfaction in life. The two measures of eudaimonic
well-being (psychological and social well-being) were designed to
examine meaning in life and self-realization, constructs that are
often neglected in conventional measures but considered es-
sential to an assessment of positive functioning (18, 26).
Overall, our results paint a picture of substantial social strat-
ification in psychological health among American adults, one
that has been widening as declines in mental health have oc-
curred unevenly across the socioeconomic spectrum. Negative
affect has increased among those of low SES with little change
among those of high SES. In contrast, but consistent with earlier
findings (24), we find no significant difference over time in de-
pression. The two measures of hedonic well-being reveal the
largest changes: substantial decreases since the late 1990s for
persons of low SES, and modest improvements for those of
high SES. Findings for psychological well-being show smaller
decreases over time and a weaker differential by SES, whereas

Goldman et al.
 the estimates for social well-being are modest and insignificant. A
possible explanation for the stronger findings for hedonic relative
to eudaimonic well-being may be that hedonic measures more
closely reflect the types of emotional setbacks, such as hopeless-
ness, that have driven individuals to seek a drug-induced euphoria.
Previous studies and journalistic narratives have focused on
despair in midlife in part because of the visibility of deaths of
despair in age groups that typically experience low overall mor-
tality. However, our findings do not suggest that heightened
distress and diminished well-being are predominantly a midlife
phenomenon. Rather, declines over time in mental health seem
to have occurred throughout the age range evaluated here. These
results are consistent with drug overdose death rates, which have
been increasing among a broad age range, at least since the late
1990s (6, 27).
Despite our implicit linkage of these changes in mental health
with time trends in opioid use and with discourse over deaths of
despair, it is important to underscore that our findings are only
suggestive of these relationships. We have not demonstrated a
direct link between an individual experience of worsening mental
health and increased substance use, nor could we do so with
repeated cross-sectional data, because the direction of causality
remains unclear. For example, it is plausible that the drug epi-
demic affected the psychological well-being of individuals as the
epidemic ravaged families and friends and weakened the social
and economic fabric of communities. The drug epidemic may
also have reduced an individual’s income, assets, or occupational
status, for example, as a result of loss of employment or a decline
in earnings (28), because of high costs of drugs and treatment or
through provision of support for loved ones.
As with all surveys, our findings may be biased by data prob-
lems. For example, information on income and assets was often
missing from MIDUS, and such data are often plagued by re-
sponse errors, owing to lack of knowledge, confusion among
income categories, poor recall, and deliberate omission because
of sensitivity of the information (29). It is also possible that re-
spondents vary in their willingness to report mental health issues.
What would be most problematic for this analysis is the occurrence
of differential response over time by SES (e.g., if the threshold for
acknowledging distress declined over time, perhaps in response to
increased media attention to widening income inequality and other
adverse conditions among the working class), but there is no way to
evaluate whether this has occurred.
Future work could extend this study by examining whether—as
the literature on deaths of despair suggests—these deleterious
changes in mental health are most prevalent among non-Latino
whites. Although small samples of minorities in MIDUS pre-
cluded such an analysis, we found that blacks fared significantly
better than whites for four of six outcomes. Nevertheless, we are
reluctant to conclude that blacks generally have better mental
health than whites. Previous research underscores the absence of
a simple ordering of racial and ethnic groups on overall mental
health (30, 31). Moreover, many psychometric instruments have
not been sufficiently validated across racial and ethnic pop-
ulations, suggesting that racial differences may at least partly
reflect variations in how individuals express feelings or perceive
their mental state (31). We are also hesitant to suggest that
mental health could account for the observed racial difference in
drug use or drug-related mortality. Although the media have
repeatedly called attention to the higher rates of opioid use
among whites, drug-related mortality rates have surged since
2010 among non-Latino blacks (27, 32). Furthermore, the racial
differential in substance abuse likely results at least in part from
unequal access to drugs, a probable explanation for higher pre-
scription opioid use among whites.
Another avenue for future research could be an exploration of
sex differences in distress and well-being. Previous work has
shown that drug overdose deaths have increased steadily for both
men and women since the late 1990s, more so in absolute terms
for men (6, 27). In addition, notable sex differences in cause-
specific mortality trends among whites (6) may relate to sex-
specific changes in mental health.
Researchers have been struggling to understand why Ameri-
cans, particularly whites of low SES, have experienced rising
rates of deaths of despair. Easier access to opioids may not be a
sufficient explanation, although increased availability undoubt-
edly plays an important role. And the answer is unlikely to rest
with simple economic explanations such as short-term declines in

SEE COMMENTARY
 employment or wages. Researchers have speculated that the ex-
planation involves complex social and economic transitions that
have emerged over recent decades, including increasing income
inequality and wage stagnation for the working class; long-term
deterioration in employment opportunities that have led to in-
tergenerational decline in economic security; reduction in stable
marriages and cohabitating unions; increasing work–family strain;
and weakening interactions within communities and associated
social isolation (7, 33–35). Unfortunately, evaluation of these
hypotheses has been largely limited to aggregate data that link
trends in social and economic variables with information on drug
use, pain, and mortality.
In exploratory analyses, we used the individual cross-sectional
data from the present study to examine the potential influence of
economic factors on mental health over this period. Specifically,
we evaluated the degree to which inclusion of economic indi-
cators measured at the two waves would reduce the coefficients
for survey wave and for the interaction between survey wave and
SES (from the values in Table 1). Inclusion of each of three
measures of perceived economic distress—an index of perceived
current financial strain and two measures of employment un-
certainty (now and in the future)—generally resulted in large
reductions in both of these coefficients. Inclusion of a broad set
of objective economic indicators led to modest although still
substantial reductions in these coefficients (SI Appendix, Table
S5). While these analyses demonstrate a strong association be-
tween trends in economic variables and mental health, we cannot
rule out potential reverse causality (e.g., the relationship be-
tween perceived economic distress and psychological distress is
almost certainly bidirectional). Future analyses based on indi-
vidual longitudinal data on psychological distress and well-being
could provide a unique opportunity to deepen our understanding
of these worrisome trends in mental health.
Materials and Methods
Data. We use data from two cross-sectional waves of the Midlife in the United
States study. In 1995 to 1996 (M1), MIDUS conducted phone interviews with a
national sample of noninstitutionalized, English-speaking adults in the co-
terminous United States, targeted at ages 25 to 74. Persons were selected by
random-digit dialing with an oversampling of older people and men (36).
Among those who completed the phone interview (n = 3,487, 70% response
rate), 3,034 (87%) also completed mail-in self-administered questionnaires
(SAQs). In 2011 to 2014 (R1), a new refresher cohort of the same age range
was sampled from the national population (the sampling frame included both
landlines and cell phones) (37). Among those who completed the phone in-
terview (n = 3,577, 59% response rate), 2,598 (73%) also completed the SAQ.
We restrict our analyses to respondents who completed the SAQ. We further
limit the primary analyses to non-Latino whites (n = 2,513 from M1 and n =
2,114 from R1). Auxiliary analyses based on the full national sample (n = 3,034
from M1 and n = 2,598 from R1) are given in SI Appendix. All analyses used
poststratification weights, which take into account age, sex, race, education,
and marital status to ensure that the MIDUS samples show very similar dis-
tributions to the corresponding Current Population Survey.
The MIDUS data are publicly available from the Inter-university Consortium
for Political and Social Research (https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/
studies/2760; https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/36532).
We used poststratification weights and supplemental data on income sources
for M1 that were obtained directly from MIDUS. Researchers can request these
income data from Barry Radler (bradler@wisc.edu). Documentation for the
construction of the poststratification weights and the Stata do-files used to
perform the analyses are available by request from the corresponding author.
Outcome Measures. We selected six established psychological summary
measures as outcome variables: (i) two measures of psychological distress
[the Kessler Psychological Distress scale (K6) of negative affect and the
Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF) subscale
for major depression]; (ii) two measures of hedonic well-being (an index of
positive affect and a rating of life satisfaction); and (iii) two measures of
eudaimonic well-being (indexes of psychological well-being and social well-
being). More detailed descriptions of these outcomes are provided in SI
Appendix. The CIDI-SF was administered during the phone interview, while
all other outcomes come from the SAQ.
Socioeconomic Status. To minimize selection biases that would result from use
of educational attainment as an indicator of SES, we use a measure of relative
socioeconomic status derived from six items: respondent’s (and spouse/
partner’s) education, respondent’s (and spouse/partner’s) occupation, an-
nual household income, and current assets of the respondent and spouse/
partner (see SI Appendix for more details). We applied a square-root
transformation to reduce skewness in income and asset data. Then, within
each wave, we standardized the six items and computed the index as the
average across relevant items (e.g., six items if married/partnered and both
respondent and spouse/partner had ever been employed; Cronbach’s α =
0.75). We converted the resulting SES score to a percentile rank (1 to 100)
based on the weighted distribution within each wave. Finally, we rescaled
the rank to range from 0 (1st percentile) to 1 (99th percentile), so that a one-
unit change represents the difference between a person in the bottom 1%
and the top 1% of the SES continuum.
Analytical Strategy. Because the two measures of distress are highly positively
skewed, we dichotomized these outcomes and estimated logit models. We
used a cutoff of four (out of seven) on the CIDI-SF subscale (14% of the
weighted full sample), which defines major depression as at least 2 wk of
either depressed mood or anhedonia (loss of interest in most things) nearly
every day for most of the day, and includes at least four symptoms associated
with depression (38). For negative affect, we used a cutoff greater than one
(out of four), which corresponds to reporting the relevant symptoms, on
average, more than “a little of the time” (18% of the weighted full sample).
The other four outcomes were modeled using linear regression and have
been standardized (mean 0, SD 1) to facilitate comparisons.
The models include controls for sex, age (specified as quadratic), SES, and
survey wave. The models also include several interaction terms. Because some
scholars have suggested that growing distress is most prominent in midlife
or among working-age adults (5), we include an interaction term between
age (linear term) and survey wave to allow changes in mental health to vary
across the age range. In addition, in light of a large literature underscoring
diminishing effects of SES on health and survival at older ages (39), we also
include an interaction between age (linear term) and SES. A third interaction
term—between SES and survey wave—reflects how changes in mental health
differ by SES. The models are estimated on weighted data from the two
pooled MIDUS waves and use robust SEs computed in Stata (40). Multiple
imputation was used for missing values of variables in the analysis. The vari-
ables with the highest percentage of missing data were household income
(18%), assets (13%), social well-being (7%), and psychological well-being (5%).
