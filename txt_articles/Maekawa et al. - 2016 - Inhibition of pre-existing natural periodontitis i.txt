Abstract
Aim—Human periodontitis is associated with overactivation of complement, which is triggered 
by different mechanisms converging on C3, the central hub of the system. We assessed whether 
the C3 inhibitor Cp40 inhibits naturally-occurring periodontitis in non-human primates.
Materials and Methods—Non-human primates with chronic periodontitis were intra-gingivally 
injected with Cp40 either once (5 animals) or three times (10 animals) weekly for six weeks 
followed by a 6-week follow-up period. Clinical periodontal examinations and collection of 
gingival crevicular fluid and biopsies of gingiva and bone were performed at baseline and during 
the study. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was used for data analysis.
Results—Whether administered once or three times weekly, Cp40 caused a significant reduction 
in clinical indices that measure periodontal inflammation (gingival index and bleeding on

osteoclastogenesis in non-human primates, suggesting a novel adjunctive anti-inflammatory

Introduction
Periodontitis is a prevalent chronic oral disease that affects nearly half of adults in the 
U.S.A. and the U.K. and perhaps worldwide (Eke et al., 2015, White et al., 2012, Demmer 
and Papapanou, 2010). The disease is driven by exaggerated inflammation induced by 
dysbiotic microbial communities forming on subgingival tooth sites (Lamont and 
Hajishengallis, 2015) and can lead to tooth loss and impaired mastication and nutritional 
status (Chapple, 2014). Tooth loss may occur as a result of excessive destruction of 
periodontium. In its severe form that affects almost 10% of adults (Eke et al., 2012, White et 
al., 2012), chronic periodontitis is not merely a common cause of tooth loss but is also 
associated with certain systemic conditions, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, rheumatoid 
arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and adverse pregnancy outcomes 
(Kebschull et al., 2010, Han et al., 2014, Hajishengallis, 2015, Tonetti et al., 2007, Koziel et 
al., 2014, Lalla and Papapanou, 2011). The serious public health impact of this oral disease 
and its economic burden (Beikler and Flemmig, 2011, Chapple, 2014) call for innovative 
treatments adjunctive to existing therapies (such as mechanical removal of the tooth-
associated biofilm and antimicrobial treatment), which are not always sufficient to control 
periodontitis (Colombo et al., 2012, Armitage, 2002, Rams et al., 2014). In the present 
study, we have tested a complement-targeted therapeutic approach in a highly relevant 
preclinical model of periodontitis.
The complement system, a network of interacting fluid-phase and cell surface-associated 
molecules, is centrally involved in immunity and inflammation through direct effects on 
immune cells or crosstalk and regulation of other host signaling pathways, such as those 
activated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Hajishengallis and Lambris, 2010). The various 
components of complement are produced systemically or locally in peripheral tissues and 
the system can be triggered via distinct cascade mechanisms (classical, lectin, or 
alternative), all of which converge at the third component (C3) (Ricklin et al., 2010). C3 
cleavage and activation by convertases leads to the generation of effector molecules that 
mediate diverse functions, including recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells 
(induced by the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a), microbial opsonization and phagocytosis (via 
opsonins such as C4b and C3b), and direct lysis of susceptible microbes (by the C5b-9 
membrane attack complex) (Ricklin et al., 2010).

 Early clinical and histological observations in human periodontitis have associated 
periodontal inflammation and tissue destruction with increased complement activity (Patters 
et al., 1989, Nikolopoulou-Papaconstantinou et al., 1987, Schenkein and Genco, 1977, 
Niekrash and Patters, 1986). Indeed, complement components and their activation products 
are readily detected in chronically inflamed gingiva and the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) 
of patients, whereas they are undetected or present at lower levels in healthy control samples 
(Courts et al., 1977, Attstrom et al., 1975, Toto et al., 1978, Nikolopoulou-Papaconstantinou 
et al., 1987, Rautemaa and Meri, 1996, Schenkein and Genco, 1977, Lally et al., 1982). 
Moreover, induction of experimental gingivitis in human volunteers causes progressive C3 
activation in the GCF (Patters et al., 1989). Conversely, a decrease in clinical parameters of 
inflammation upon successful periodontal therapy leads to reduced C3 activation in the GCF 
(Niekrash and Patters, 1985).
More recently, studies in animal models, including mouse strains with complement 
knockout mutations, have established a cause-and-effect relationship between complement 
activation and periodontitis and gleaned insights into the mechanisms whereby complement 
mediates periodontitis (Breivik et al., 2011, Liang et al., 2011, Hajishengallis et al., 2011, 
Maekawa et al., 2014a, Maekawa et al., 2014b). In this regard, we have shown that C3-
dependent inflammation in mice is crucial for the long-term sustenance of the dysbiotic 
microbiota and for maximal induction of alveolar bone loss (Maekawa et al., 2014a). 
Consistent with these findings, local C3 inhibition in a model of ligature-induced 
periodontitis in young non-human primates (NHPs) prevents the development of gingival 
inflammation and alveolar bone loss (Maekawa et al., 2014a). The inhibitor we used was 
Cp40, an improved analog of compstatin, which is a peptidic compound that blocks C3 
activation exclusively in humans and non-human primates (Ricklin and Lambris, 2013, 
Mastellos et al., 2015b, Qu et al., 2013). Cp40 and other compstatin analogs bind C3 and 
interfere with its binding to and cleavage by the C3 convertase, thereby blocking the 
generation of downstream effector molecules regardless of the initiation mechanism of 
complement activation (Ricklin and Lambris, 2013, Mastellos et al., 2015b).
However, whether Cp40 is effective in a therapeutic – rather than preventive – setting was 
not addressed in our previous publication. The main objective of the current study was 
therefore to determine whether local C3 inhibition could inhibit pre-existing chronic 
periodontal disease, which typically affects adults; in this context, aging is thought to affect 
the immunoinflammatory status of the periodontal tissue, thereby contributing to increased 
susceptibility to periodontitis (Hajishengallis, 2014a). This notion is consistent with recent 
studies in NHPs showing age-dependent differential expression of immune and 
inflammatory genes in the periodontium (Ebersole et al., 2015, Gonzalez et al., 2015). By 
screening a population of adult NHPs (cynomolgus monkeys) in the Simian Conservation 
Breeding and Research Center (SICONBREC; Makati, Philippines), we identified animals 
with naturally occurring chronic periodontitis and treated them with Cp40. Our results show 
that locally administered Cp40 can reverse pre-existing chronic periodontal inflammation in 
the absence of additional treatments, such as scaling and root planing, thus identifying an 
anti-inflammatory therapy that can potentially contribute to the treatment of human 
periodontitis.

 Materials and Methods
Non-human primates
All animal procedures were performed according to protocols reviewed and approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Pennsylvania and of the 
Simian Conservation Breeding and Research Center (SICONBREC; Makati City, 
Philippines), an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care 
International-accredited facility where the NHP work was performed. Fifteen adult male 
cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) (7 – 15 years old; 5.0 – 7.6 kg body weight) 
were selected for the study after screening the SICONBREC breeding colonies for animals 
with chronic periodontitis. The inclusion criteria were the presence of at least 30% of sites 
with probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level ≥ 4 mm, associated with bleeding on 
probing, and radiographic evidence of bone loss (using a digital X-ray dental system; 
Vatech). The animals were socially housed in stainless steel cages and were used in the 
study after they were acclimatized to the protocol procedures for 4 weeks. Environmental 
enrichment was provided through daily handling by animal care technicians, environmental 
enrichment items, and visual contact with other study animals. Each animal was offered a 
measured amount of an approved feed mixture. Fresh, potable drinking water was available 
to the animals ad libitum. Clinical periodontal examinations, dental X-rays, collection of 
gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), and periodontal tissue biopsies were performed in a manner 
similar to a human clinical study, except that the animals were anesthetized during the 
procedures.
C3 inhibitor
The compstatin analog Cp40 (y-I[CV(1MeW)QDW-Sar-AHRC](NMeI)-NH2; with y = D-
tyrosine; Sar = sarcosine/N-methyl glycine) was produced as a disulfide-bridged, cyclic 
peptide by solid-phase peptide synthesis methodology as previously described (Qu et al., 
2013).
Experimental design
The study involved a 6-week treatment period with Cp40 and a 6-week follow-up period 
without Cp40 treatment. Cp40 was administered either once a week (5 animals; “1X-
treatment”) or three times per week (10 animals; “3x-treatment”). Specifically, using a 30-g 
short needle, Cp40 was injected locally into the gingiva (100 μg/site in 50-μl volume) of 
anterior and posterior teeth on both sides of the maxilla (15 sites total; 13 sites 
corresponding to palatal interdental papillae and 2 sites corresponding to the distal gingiva 
of the second molars). Clinical readings made before Cp40 administration served as baseline 
controls for each animal. The mandible was not treated with Cp40 but was monitored by 
clinical periodontal examination and sampling of biological specimens (see below) 
throughout the study, for comparative purposes. Clinical examinations, sample collection 
and standard laboratory techniques (immunofluorescence histochemistry, histological TRAP 
staining, and assessment of host immune responses) are described in Supplementary 
Methods.

 Statistical analysis
For the comparison of mean values within the groups during the time–course studies, one-
way repeated-measures ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction was performed using 
the GraphPad Prism program, version 6.0h (La Jolla, CA, USA). In case of significant 
differences, Bonferroni’s or Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was performed.
Results
Locally administered Cp40 inhibits clinical periodontal inflammation in NHPs
All animals enrolled in the study were systemically healthy and maintained good systemic 
health during the observation period. No adverse effects were noted during the course of the 
study. To determine whether complement is causally linked to inflammation associated with 
naturally occurring chronic periodontitis, we targeted the central complement component 
C3. Specifically, we locally injected the C3-specific inhibitor Cp40 into the maxillary 
gingiva of NHPs. Initially, the drug was administered for 6 weeks at a frequency of three 
times weekly (“3X-treatment”) and its clinical effects were monitored for 12 weeks. Cp40 
caused a significant reduction in several clinical indices that measure periodontal 
inflammation (gingival index and bleeding on probing), tissue destruction (probing pocket 
depth and clinical attachment level) or tooth mobility often associated with bone loss (Fig. 
1A–E). These data indicate that, at least by clinical criteria, Cp40 blocks inflammatory 
processes that drive periodontal tissue destruction. Interestingly, these protective effects 
were evident as early as one week after treatment initiation and progressively improved until 
week 6, when the drug was discontinued. Remarkably, the protective effects of Cp40 
persisted for at least six additional weeks, since at the termination of the study (week 12) all 
indices remained at significantly lower levels relative to their corresponding baselines (Fig. 
1A–E). Importantly, without any exception, all ten cynomolgus monkeys responded 
favorably to Cp40 with 57–87 % reduction in gingival inflammation and 31–58 % decrease 
in the depths of the periodontal pockets after 6 weeks of treatment (Supplementary figs. S1–
S10). The plaque index, a clinical measure of biofilm accumulation on tooth surfaces, was 
modestly but significantly reduced by Cp40 at a few time points, immediately before and 
after week 6 (Fig. 1F). The aforementioned clinical indices were also monitored in the 
untreated jaw (mandible) during the same 12-week interval. In contrast to the improved 
clinical condition of the Cp40-treated maxilla, the clinical indices in the mandible did not 
show significant differences in the course of the study as compared to their baseline values 
(Fig. 1A–F).
In a second, independent experiment, we investigated whether Cp40 could retain its efficacy 
if administered only once per week (“1X-treatment”). Similar clinical analyses revealed that 
a single weekly administration of Cp40 could significantly reduce indices of clinical 
inflammation and tissue destruction (Fig. 2), with almost comparable efficacy and similar 
time course pattern to that of the 3X-treatment (see superimposition of the data in 
Supplementary fig. S11). Moreover, similarly to the 3X-treatment, all five cynomolgus 
monkeys used in the 1X-treatment study responded favorably to the drug with no exception 
(Supplementary figs. S12–S16).

 Decreased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators following local treatment with Cp40
GCF was collected for monitoring changes in the cytokine and immune mediator levels 
during the 6-week course of Cp40 treatments, as well as during the follow-up period to week 
12. Multi-cytokine analysis of the GCF revealed that the 3X-treatment with Cp40 resulted in 
significantly lower levels of pro-inflammatory and osteoclastogenic cytokines, as compared 
to their baseline values (Fig. 3). The pro-inflammatory cytokines measured included IL-1β, 
IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17 (Fig. 3A–D), all of which have been associated with periodontal 
inflammation in humans (Graves, 2008, Zenobia and Hajishengallis, 2015, Moutsopoulos et 
al., 2012), and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) (Fig. 3E), a key 
osteoclastogenic cytokine involved in bone loss disorders including periodontitis (Bostanci 
et al., 2007, Miossec and Kolls, 2012). In contrast, the GCF levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG), 
a natural antagonist of RANKL (Bostanci et al., 2007, Miossec and Kolls, 2012), were 
increased upon Cp40 treatment relative to baseline (Fig. 3F). Cp40 also caused a significant 
decrease in the GCF levels of C3a and C5/C5a as seen as early as one week after treatment 
(Figs. 3G and 3H, respectively). These favorable changes in the host response profile 
(inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators and upregulation of OPG) were most pronounced 
at 6 weeks, although significant changes persisted for the entire or most of the study 
duration (12 weeks), despite drug withdrawal at week 6 (Fig. 3). The same mediators were 
monitored in GCF samples collected from the untreated jaw (mandible) during the same 12-
week interval but did not show significant differences relative to baseline values (Fig. 3). 
Importantly, Cp40 retained its capacity to significantly suppress the GCF levels of pro-
inflammatory mediators and upregulate OPG even when administered only once per week 
(Fig. 4).
The anti-inflammatory action of Cp40 was also evident in the periodontal tissue (Fig. 5), 
thus confirming the GCF findings. Specifically, immunofluorescence histochemistry of 
biopsy specimens taken before (0 weeks) and after (6 weeks) treatment showed that Cp40 
caused decreased expression of IL-17, RANKL, and elevated expression of OPG in the 
connective tissue adjacent to the alveolar bone at 6 weeks relative to baseline (Fig. 5). 
Moreover, Cp40 treatment caused a decrease in the complement cleavage fragments C3d 
and C5a (Fig. 5), further confirming its ability to inhibit complement activation.
The inhibitory action of Cp40 on the various pro-inflammatory and/or pro-osteoclastogenic 
cytokines was mediated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level since the expression of 
gingival IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, and RANKL mRNA was significantly inhibited in animals 
with 3X or 1X weekly treatments (Fig. 6A and B, respectively). Conversely, and in accord 
with the protein data, OPG mRNA expression was increased (Fig. 6). The characteristic 
elevation of IL-1β in human periodontitis (compared to periodontal health) has been 
correlated with increased NLRP3 (NALP3) inflammasome mRNA expression levels 
(Bostanci et al., 2009). In this regard, Cp40 inhibited the gingival NLRP3 mRNA expression 
in NHPs (Fig. 6), suggesting its potential to interfere with NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent 
processing of IL-1β; this notion is consistent with the reduced levels of IL-1β protein in the 
GCF of Cp40-treated animals (Fig. 3A and 4A).

 Cp40 causes a reduction in the numbers of periodontal osteoclasts in NHPs
The RANKL/OPG ratio in the GCF is a potential indicator of periodontitis (Belibasakis and 
Bostanci, 2012, Bostanci et al., 2007). We therefore determined whether the ability of Cp40 
to decrease the GCF levels of RANKL and enhance the levels of OPG (Figs. 3 and 4), hence 
to lower the RANKL/OPG ratio, could have an impact on osteoclastogenesis. To this end, 
we counted the numbers of osteoclasts (TRAP-positive multinucleated cells; Supplementary 
fig. S17) in bone biopsies taken at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks following Cp40 treatment. 
We found that in the maxillae of the animals, Cp40 caused a significant decrease in the 
numbers of osteoclasts after 6 weeks of 3X or 1X weekly treatments (Fig. 7, A and B [left 
panels]). This favorable effect persisted through to week 12, even though the drug was not 
administered in the last 6 weeks (Fig. 7, A and B, left panels). In contrast, the numbers of 
osteoclasts in the mandibles, which were not treated, did not display significant differences 
in the course of the study (Fig. 7, A and B, right panels).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study marks the first time that a pharmacological 
intervention – whether host-modulation or antimicrobial – is shown to inhibit inflammation 
in the context of naturally occurring periodontitis in NHPs. Previously conducted studies, 
including our own, have used inducible models of the disease involving placement of 
ligatures with or without exogenous inoculation of periodontal pathogens (Page et al., 2007, 
Assuma et al., 1998, Cappelli et al., 2000, Maekawa et al., 2014a, Moritz et al., 1998, 
Nisengard et al., 1989, Persson et al., 1994, Li et al., 1996, Offenbacher et al., 1987, Roberts 
et al., 2004, Pierce and Lindskog, 1987, Shin et al., 2015). The immune system and 
periodontal anatomy of the cynomolgus monkey is similar to that of humans, and 
periodontitis in these animals exhibits clinical, microbiological, and immunohistological 
features that are highly similar to those observed in human periodontitis (Brecx et al., 1985, 
Page and Schroeder, 1982, Kornman et al., 1981, Ebersole et al., 2014, Ebersole et al., 
2002). Therefore, the cynomolgus model, especially in the setting of naturally occurring 
periodontitis, is considerably more predictive of drug efficacy in humans compared to 
widely used models, such as those in rodents, rabbits, or dogs. The successful Cp40 
inhibition of natural periodontal inflammation and osteoclastogenesis in NHPs additionally 
shows unequivocally that C3 is critical for the pathogenesis of this oral disease, as suggested 
by earlier correlative human clinical studies (Toto et al., 1978, Schenkein and Genco, 1977, 
Patters et al., 1989, Niekrash and Patters, 1985, Attstrom et al., 1975, Nikolopoulou-
Papaconstantinou et al., 1987, Hajishengallis, 2010). In conjunction with the earlier human 
studies, the present work places periodontitis to a growing list of diseases with substantial 
complement involvement, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), age-
related macular degeneration, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis 
(Ricklin and Lambris, 2013). Consistent with the role of C3 as a potential therapeutic target 
in periodontitis, a recent report has identified C3 among the top 21 most promising 
candidate genes involved in periodontitis, by using an integrative gene prioritization method 
and databases from genome-wide association studies and microarray experiments (Zhan et 
al., 2014).

 The complement-inhibition capacity of Cp40 was confirmed by findings of decreased GCF 
levels of C3a and C5/C5a. The detecting antibody utilized in the latter assay does not 
distinguish between C5 and the activation product C5a and, therefore, C5 levels could be 
reduced indirectly by Cp40 through inhibition of inflammation (Zou et al., 2013). However, 
the ability of Cp40 to reduce C3a definitely confirmed its potential to inhibit complement 
activation in our study. In this regard, it is uncertain if intra-gingivally administered Cp40 
inhibited complement activation in the gingival tissue resulting in lower levels of available 
C3a to transudate to the periodontal pocket or whether Cp40 also diffused to the periodontal 
pocket where it could additionally block complement activation in the GCF. Although both 
possibilities are likely, the ability of Cp40 to block complement in the gingiva was 
confirmed by immunohistochemistry that showed decreased levels of the complement 
cleavage products (C3d and C5a) in the connective tissue in the vicinity of the bone.
Cp40 is the first compstatin analog with subnanomolar target affinity (KD = 0.5 nM) and 
features a plasma half-life that exceeds expectations for most peptidic drugs (Qu et al., 2013, 
Mastellos et al., 2015b). The relatively long half-life of the Cp40 peptide was attributed to a 
“target-driven” model, according to which an initial rapid clearance of excess free peptide 
(i.e., not bound to C3) is followed by slow clearance of C3-bound peptide. As the measured 
half-life values of different compstatin analogs correlate positively with their binding 
affinities for C3 (Qu et al., 2013), it can be inferred that the tight binding of Cp40 to C3 
delays its clearance. Similarly, the expected tight binding of Cp40 to abundant C3 in the 
inflamed periodontium could contribute to delayed elimination of the drug from the tissues, 
in turn accounting– at least in part– for the sustained protective effect of Cp40 observed in 
this study. Alternatively, or additionally, it is likely that the observed suppression of 
inflammation by Cp40 tips the balance towards tissue homeostasis, which might then resist 
pathological processes for some time even in the absence of the drug. In this regard, the 
clinical periodontal indices, the GCF levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, and the numbers 
of periodontal osteoclasts persisted at lower levels than their corresponding baseline values 
for at least 6 weeks following drug withdrawal.
Given that complement is not a linear cascade of events but essentially a hub-like network 
that is tightly connected to other components of the immune system (Ricklin et al., 2010), it 
is plausible that C3 inhibition has a far-reaching impact above and beyond complement 
itself. For instance, C3a- and C5a-induced signaling pathways cross-talk with and amplify 
TLR-mediated inflammatory responses in various tissues including the periodontium (Abe 
et al., 2012, Hajishengallis and Lambris, 2010, Zhang et al., 2007). Complement inhibition, 
therefore, is likely to mitigate inflammation initiated through TLR activation, either by 
microbial ligands (e.g., bacterial lipopolysaccharide or lipoproteins) or by endogenous 
molecules acting as danger signals upon their release due to inflammatory tissue destruction 
(e.g., biglycan, hyaluronan fragments, and heparan sulfate fragments) (Miyake, 2007, 
Schaefer, 2010). These considerations may in part explain why the inhibition of a single 
molecule, C3, has a strong influence on the course of natural periodontal inflammation.
It was also recently shown that, in human monocytes, C3a regulates the release of 
intracellular ATP into the extracellular space, thereby controlling NLRP3 inflammasome 
activation and subsequent secretion of IL-1β, which in turn promotes human CD4+ T cell

 production of IL-17 (Asgari et al., 2013). In this regard, a clinical study has shown enhanced 
expression of NLRP3 (NALP3) inflammasome in periodontitis correlating with increased 
IL-1β expression levels (Bostanci et al., 2009). Moreover, the formation of sublytic C5b-9 
complex on human epithelial cells induces intracellular Ca2+ fluxes leading to NLRP3 
inflammasome activation and IL-1β release (Triantafilou et al., 2013). Both of these 
complement-dependent inflammatory mechanisms can be blocked by Cp40, potentially 
accounting – at least in part – for the reduced IL-1β and IL-17 levels after Cp40 treatment. 
In fact, the ability of Cp40 to reduce the levels of IL-1β protein in the GCF might, in part, be 
related to its capacity to inhibit the expression of NLRP3 which is involved in caspase-1–
mediated processing and release of IL-1β protein (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014).
Cp40-mediated inhibition of IL-17 could in turn contribute to the observed suppression of 
RANKL, since IL-17 upregulates RANKL by acting on lymphocytes and stromal cells (e.g., 
fibroblasts and osteoblasts) (Miossec and Kolls, 2012). Besides inhibiting RANKL 
expression, Cp40 also caused a concomitant increase in the levels of OPG, both in the 
gingival tissue and the GCF. Although the underlying mechanisms are uncertain, RANKL 
and OPG were shown to be conversely regulated by several stimuli (Boespflug et al., 2014, 
Lee and Lorenzo, 1999, Devi et al., 2013). For instance, IL-17 was shown to induce 
RANKL and suppress OPG expression in human periodontal ligament cells (Devi et al., 
2013). Consistently, the ability of Cp40 to decrease the RANKL/OPG ratio was associated 
with decreased osteoclastogenesis in bone biopsy samples. Therefore, Cp40 has the potential 
to inhibit naturally occurring bone loss, in accord with its capacity to block ligature-induced 
bone loss in NHPs (Maekawa et al., 2014a). Although induction of measurable bone loss can 
be observed within a few weeks in the relatively acute ligature-induced model, bone loss is a 
relatively slow process in naturally occurring chronic periodontitis (hence changes in bone 
loss could not be detected radiographically in the current study due to its relatively short 
duration).
By inhibiting complement at the level of C3, Cp40 (and earlier compstatin analogs) does not 
interfere with C4b-mediated opsonization of bacteria via the classical and lectin pathways 
(Kirjavainen et al., 2008). Nevertheless, for increased safety, Cp40 treatments in disease 
settings requiring long-term systemic intervention (e.g., in PNH (Risitano et al., 2014)) 
would necessitate vaccination against encapsulated bacteria (e.g., meningococci) to 
minimize the risk of potential infections (Mastellos et al., 2015a). Importantly, these 
potential safety considerations are unlikely to apply to the treatment of periodontitis through 
local Cp40 administration. In this regard, C3-deficient mice display reduced periodontal 
bacterial load compared to C3-sufficient controls in the course of experimental periodontitis 
(Maekawa et al., 2014a), suggesting that impaired complement activation does not 
predispose to defective immune surveillance in the periodontium. These findings are in 
accord with the notion that inflammation generates tissue breakdown products (e.g., 
degraded collagen peptides or heme-containing compounds) that serve the nutritional needs 
of periodontitis-associated bacteria (Hajishengallis, 2014b, Marsh, 2003). Indeed, studies in 
mouse and rabbit models of periodontitis indicate that the control of inflammation also 
reduces the bacterial load (Hasturk et al., 2007, Eskan et al., 2012, Abe et al., 2014, 
Moutsopoulos et al., 2014). Conversely, and consistently, the bacterial biomass of human

 periodontitis-associated biofilms increases with escalating periodontal inflammation 
(Abusleme et al., 2013).
Although Cp40 was successfully applied as a stand-alone treatment in the current NHP 
study, it can be envisioned as an adjunctive therapy to the management of human chronic 
periodontitis. Future clinical trials could investigate the potential of Cp40 to inhibit 
periodontal inflammation and bone loss compared to scaling and root planing, whereas in 
very severe cases of the disease, Cp40 could be combined with scaling and root planing and 
compared to periodontal surgery, in an effort to obviate the need for a surgical approach. It 
should be noted that future host-modulation interventions, such as Cp40, would not 
necessarily be implemented in a therapeutic setting but could also be provided on a 
preventive basis to high-risk individuals, such as cigarette smokers and diabetic patients 
(Heitz-Mayfield, 2005, Genco and Genco, 2014), before the onset of periodontitis. A 
clinically developed Cp40-based drug (AMY-101; Amyndas Pharmaceuticals) is currently 
under evaluation as a potential treatment of complications of ABO-incompatible kidney 
transplantation and PNH (Mastellos et al., 2015b). Whether Cp40/AMY-101 can find 
application for the treatment of human periodontitis is a possibility that– based on the results 
of this NHP study– merits investigation in future clinical trials.

 Clinical Relevance
Scientific rationale for study
Most interventional studies in animal models of periodontitis are performed in a 
preventive (rather than therapeutic) setting and involve inducible models of the disease. 
To increase the predictive value of preclinical intervention for drug efficacy in humans, 
we used non-human primates with naturally occurring periodontitis to test the therapeutic 
potential of a complement inhibitor (Cp40).
Principal findings
Cp40 inhibited pre-existing periodontal inflammation (determined by both clinical and 
laboratory assessment) and osteoclastogenesis in non-human primates, a clinically 
relevant model of human periodontitis.
Practical implications
These findings pave the way for testing Cp40 in future clinical trials for the treatment of 
human periodontitis.

 Figure 1. Cp40 decreases inflammatory clinical parameters of naturally occurring chronic 
periodontitis in NHPs after local administration three times weekly
Cp40 was injected – three times weekly for 6 weeks – into the interdental papillae and the 
distal gingiva of the second molars of the maxilla (“Cp40”), whereas the mandible was not 
treated (“Untreated”). Each animal was clinically examined at the indicated time points and 
the following clinical parameters were recorded: (A) gingival index; (B) bleeding on 
probing; (C) probing pocket depth; (D) clinical attachment level; (E) mobility index; and (F) 
plaque index. The data were expressed relative to the baseline values (at week 0), set as 100 
(Raw data are shown for each animal in supplementary figures S1 to S10). Results are

 Figure 3. Decreased GCF levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-osteoclastogenic mediators in 
NHPs with natural periodontitis after local treatment with Cp40 three times weekly
At the indicated time-points, GCF was collected from monkeys with natural periodontitis 
which were treated three times weekly for 6 weeks with Cp40 in the maxilla (“Cp40”) but 
not in the mandible (“Untreated”). Total cytokine or mediator content (A, IL-1β; B, IL-6; C, 
IL-8; D, IL-17; E, RANKL; F, OPG; G, C3a; H, C5/C5a) in the eluted GCF samples was 
measured using a Bio-Plex system or ELISA (C3a only). Data are means ± SD (n = 10 
monkeys). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 compared to baseline (one-way repeated-measures

 Figure 5. Expression of inflammatory and osteoclastogenesis-related molecules in periodontal 
biopsy specimens from Cp40-treated NHPs
Periodontal biopsy specimens from the maxillae of NHPs treated with Cp40 were processed 
for fluorescent microscopy. The specimens were taken before (week 0) and after (week 6) 
treatment with Cp40 locally administered three times weekly. Shown are representative 
overlays of differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescent images stained for the 
indicated molecules. B, bone; CT, connective tissue. Scale bar, 100 μm.

 Figure 6. Cp40 inhibits mRNA expression of gingival inflammatory mediators in NHPs
Gingival tissue biopsies were taken from the maxilla of NHPs treated three times (A) or 
once (B) weekly for 6 weeks and extracted RNA was subjected to real-time PCR processed 
to determine mRNA expression of the indicated molecules at the indicated times. Data were 
normalized to GADPH mRNA and are presented as fold change in the transcript levels 
relative to baseline levels (prior to treatment; week 0), set as 1. Data are means ± SD (A, n = 
10 monkeys; B, n = 5 monkeys). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 compared to baseline (one-way 
repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test). NS, not

 Figure 7. Decreased numbers of osteoclasts after treatment of natural NHP periodontitis with 
Cp40
At the indicated time-points, alveolar bone biopsies were obtained from monkeys with 
natural periodontitis. The animals were treated three times (A) or once (B) weekly for 6 
weeks with Cp40 in the maxilla but not in the mandible (“Untreated”). TRAP-positive 
multinucleated cells (osteoclasts) were enumerated in 10 randomly selected sections for each 
bone biopsy specimen from the maxilla or mandible of each of the animals. The numbers of 
osteoclasts were averaged for each biopsy specimen and are represented by dots. Scatter dot 
plots with mean ± SD are shown for each group of monkeys (A, n = 10; B, n = 5 animals). 
Indicated P values determined by one-way repeated-measures ANOVA and Tukey’s 
multiple comparisons test.
