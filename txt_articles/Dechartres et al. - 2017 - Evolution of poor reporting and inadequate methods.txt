Abstract
Objective To examine how poor reporting and inadequate methods for
key methodological features in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have
changed over the past three decades.
Design Mapping of trials included in Cochrane reviews.
Data sources Data from RCTs included in all Cochrane reviews
published between March 2011 and September 2014 reporting an
evaluation of the Cochrane risk of bias items: sequence generation,
allocation concealment, blinding, and incomplete outcome data.
Data extraction For each RCT, we extracted consensus on risk of bias
made by the review authors and identified the primary reference to
extract publication year and journal. We matched journal names with
Journal Citation Reports to get 2014 impact factors.
Main outcomes measures We considered the proportions of trials rated
by review authors at unclear and high risk of bias as surrogates for poor
reporting and inadequate methods, respectively.
Results We analysed 20 920 RCTs (from 2001 reviews) published in
3136 journals. The proportion of trials with unclear risk of bias was 48.7%
for sequence generation and 57.5% for allocation concealment; the
proportion of those with high risk of bias was 4.0% and 7.2%,
respectively. For blinding and incomplete outcome data, 30.6% and
24.7% of trials were at unclear risk and 33.1% and 17.1% were at high
risk, respectively. Higher journal impact factor was associated with a
lower proportion of trials at unclear or high risk of bias. The proportion
of trials at unclear risk of bias decreased over time, especially for
sequence generation, which fell from 69.1% in 1986-1990 to 31.2% in
2011-14 and for allocation concealment (70.1% to 44.6%). After excluding
trials at unclear risk of bias, use of inadequate methods also decreased
over time: from 14.8% to 4.6% for sequence generation and from 32.7%
to 11.6% for allocation concealment.
Conclusions Poor reporting and inadequate methods have decreased
over time, especially for sequence generation and allocation
concealment. But more could be done, especially in lower impact factor
journals.
Introduction
The public has the right to expect that information about the
efficacy and safety of health interventions is complete,
transparent, and reliable and that research investments are not
wasted.1-7 Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the reference
standard for assessing the efficacy of interventions, but how
they are planned, conducted, and reported raises important
concerns.5 6 Empirical evidence shows that using inadequate
methods to generate randomisation sequences, not concealing
allocation, lack of blinding, and excluding patients from analyses
can bias findings.8-12 Yet half of RCTs fail to take adequate steps
to reduce such bias.3-13
Poor reporting of methods is another common problem.3 5
Although it does not necessarily reflect poor methods,14 15 poor
reporting prevents readers from adequately assessing whether
the methods are reliable and whether the results and conclusions
of RCTs can be trusted. It also limits reproducibility.16 RCTs
that use inadequate methods or that are poorly reported might
not contribute to the evidence base, which is a waste of resources
that affects not only RCTs but also the systematic reviews that
include them.

 Many methodological studies have evaluated the quality of
reporting and risk of bias in RCTs.17-30 But most have focused
on small numbers of trials or specific diseases, journals, or time
periods. These studies used various criteria for their assessments,
which were frequently not defined.17 We therefore lack
knowledge of the global magnitude of poor reporting and
inadequate methods in RCTs and how they have changed over
time. A comprehensive picture of the quality of research would
help us better understand the disparities between journals and
to propose practical ways of improvement.
Cochrane reviews are uniquely placed to evaluate the quality
of research. They synthesise findings from RCTs and are used
to aid decision making and develop practice guidelines.31 32 The
risk of bias of each included study is systematically assessed in
duplicate by trained reviewers who reach consensus. Reviewers
use the Cochrane risk of bias tool, which assesses several
methodological items that are considered crucial to evaluating
the validity of an RCT.33 34
We examined how poor reporting and inadequate methods have
changed over the past three decades, both in and between
journals, using the data included in Cochrane reviews.
Methods
We used the proportion of trials considered by the review
authors to be at high or unclear risk of bias as surrogate measures
of inadequate methods and poor reporting, respectively. We
focused on several key items of the Cochrane risk of bias tool:
sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of
participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors, and
incomplete outcome data (table 1⇓) because they are associated
with intervention effect estimates in meta-epidemiological
studies.33-36
Data sources
We obtained data from all Cochrane reviews published between
March 2011 and September 2014. We chose March 2011
because it corresponded to the most recent update of the
Cochrane risk of bias tool.34 An XML file was provided for each
review consisting of all data entered by the review authors in
Review Manager, the software used for preparing and
maintaining Cochrane reviews.37 Each file contained information
for all studies included in the review, including methods
summary, references, and consensus on risk of bias assessment
between the reviewers.34
We downloaded the Web of Science and PubMed databases for
the list of indexed journals and the Journal Citation Reports
database for the list of journals with their medical categories
and 2014 impact factors.
Constitution of a unique database
We combined all individual XML files into a single database
using R v3.2.2 with the XML package (https://www.R-project.
org/). We first standardised the wording about risk of bias items
because it varied across reviews. Two of us (AD, LT) manually
classified them using a standardised set of risk of bias items,
and all disagreements were resolved by discussion.
Selection of eligible Cochrane reviews
If the Cochrane review had been updated within our search
limits, we considered the most recent version. We excluded
reviews that had been withdrawn and “empty” reviews (that is,
those not including any studies). We focused on reviews of
RCTs only and excluded those of observational or
non-randomised studies. To identify observational or
non-randomised studies, two of us (AD, LT) made a list of
keywords that could correspond to observational studies—for
example, “observational,” “cohort,” and “case-control”—that
were automatically searched in the free text description of the
methods summary. We also identified risk of bias items that
could correspond to observational studies; for example,
“potential confounding factors taken into account.” We excluded
reviews reporting these keywords or items.
Then, we identified reviews that included an assessment of the
risk of bias for the following key items: sequence generation,
allocation concealment, blinding (whatever the type of blinding
item), and incomplete outcome data. Some reviews assessed
blinding overall (according to a previous version of the risk of
bias tool), with no distinction between blinding of participants
and personnel and blinding of outcome assessors. So we
considered reviews eligible if they reported at least one item
concerning blinding—blinding overall, blinding of participants
and personnel, or blinding of outcome assessors.
Selection of eligible RCTs and identification
of corresponding primary reference
We excluded RCTs if the results were not reported in at least
one journal article published after 1985. We excluded RCT
results published before 1986 (corresponding to the 10th centile
of trial year of publication) to focus on contemporary trials. We
first extracted the references for all RCTs included in the eligible
Cochrane reviews, including the reference type (journal article,
book section, or conference proceedings). Then we used a
matching algorithm38 and manual validation to identify duplicate
references, and we excluded trials that were included in more
than one review. For RCTs that referenced more than one journal
article, we selected the primary reference reported by the review
authors. For the few cases that had several primary references,
we manually identified the reference corresponding to reporting
of the main results. We excluded RCTs for which no primary
reference was reported. We also excluded RCTs reported in
abstract format only (reported as such in the characteristics of
included studies). We extracted the year of publication and
journal names of the primary reference for all selected RCTs.
Matching journal names with Web of Science,
PubMed, and Journal Citation Reports
We used the Web of Science and PubMed databases to
standardise journal names and abbreviations. One of us (AD)
manually reviewed journal names that could not be matched to
verify whether they corresponded to existing journals that were
not indexed. This enabled us to identify variations in journal
names (for example, Critical Care, Critical Care London, and
Critical Care London England), which were corrected according
to Web of Science or PubMed. We excluded RCTs with journal
names corresponding to non-existing journals. Finally, for each
journal we extracted the 2014 journal impact factor, medical
category, average impact factor centile across medical
categories, country, and language from Journal Citation Reports.
For journals not included in Journal Citation Reports, we
manually evaluated the main medical category and the language.
Extraction of risk of bias assessment
For each RCT we extracted the Cochrane risk of bias judgments,
which were“low,” “high,” or “unclear” for each of the five key
items (sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding
of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors,
and incomplete outcome data). When a Cochrane review

 assigned more than one judgment to the same item (for example,
blinding might have been assessed for each outcome) we
considered the risk of bias judgment corresponding to subjective
outcomes, because objective outcomes should be low risk. For
trials that assessed blinding overall, we considered the risk of
bias to be the same for both blinding of participants and
personnel and blinding of outcome assessors. For trials that
were included in more than one Cochrane review, we extracted
the risk of bias assessment for the most recent.
Summary of data available for each included
RCT
Publication characteristics—year of publication, journal name,
medical category, language, and whether the journal was indexed
in Web of Science, PubMed, and Journal Citation Reports. For
RCTs published in a journal indexed in Journal Citation
Reports, we also had the journal 2014 impact factor.
Risk of bias assessment—final judgment, corresponding to the
consensus of two trained reviewers, for: sequence generation,
allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel,
blinding of outcome assessors, and incomplete outcome data.
Assessment of poor reporting and inadequate
methods
The Cochrane Handbook says that risk of bias should be
considered unclear if there is insufficient information to permit
judgment of low or high risk.33 34 So an item classified as unclear
can be considered poorly reported. A judgment of high risk is
given when inadequate methods or conduct could result in a
bias of sufficient magnitude to have a notable effect on the
results or conclusions of the trial.34 We used the proportion of
trials considered by the review authors to be at unclear or high
risk of bias as surrogates for poor reporting and inadequate
methods, respectively.
Analysis
The analysis was descriptive. We first assessed the overall
proportion of trials at unclear and high risk of bias. Then we
examined how poor reporting and inadequate methods changed
over time. Because inadequate methods can only be assessed
when reporting is adequate, we performed two analyses for the
evolution of inadequate methods: one based on all trials and
one based on only trials that were not at unclear risk.
We predefined four subgroup analyses according to: impact
factor (≥10, 5-10, <5, no IF); centile of impact factor within the
medical categories (≥90th centile, 70-90th, <70th percentile,
no IF); medical subject category according to Journal Citation
Reports (“medicine, general and internal” versus other); and
each of the 10 journals with the most RCTs. One reviewer
suggested an additional subgroup analysis on language (English
only versus other).
Patient involvement
Patients were not involved in any aspect of the study design,
conduct, or in the development of the research question or
outcome measures. There are no plans to disseminate the results
of the research to study participants or the relevant patient
community. This study is research on existing published research
and therefore there was no active patient recruitment for data
collection.
Results
Selection and general characteristics
The selection process is reported in web appendix 1. We
included data from 2001 systematic reviews, including 20 920
unique articles (median year of publication 2003, interquartile
range 1997-2008) published in 3136 journals. 19 551 (93.4%)
articles were published in 2390 journals indexed in Web of
Science or PubMed, and 17 944 (85.8%) were published in 1706
journals indexed in Journal Citation Reports. The median impact
factor for the journals was 3.4 (interquartile range 2.0-5.5) (table
2⇓). Most RCTs were published in journals with impact factors
<5 or between 5 and 10 (12 496 (59.7%) and 3134 (15.0%),
respectively). Of the journals indexed in Journal Citation
Reports, 165 (9.7%) were non-English and included 584 RCTs,
corresponding to 3.2% of RCTs published in journals with
impact factors. 2976 RCTs were published in 1430 journals
without impact factors (14.2%).
Characteristics of journals without impact
factors
Among the 1430 journals without impact factors, 743 (52.0%)
were non-English and included 1511 RCTs (50.8% of RCTs
published in journals without impact factors). The most common
medical categories were integrative and complementary
medicine and medicine, general and internal with 521 RCTs for
each. We identified 12 journals (including 29 RCTs) that did
not have an impact factor in 2014 but had one in 2015 and 102
journals (including 287 RCTs) that had had an impact factor
before 2014.
Overall assessment of poor reporting and
inadequate methods
The proportion of trials at unclear risk of bias was high for
sequence generation and allocation concealment (48.7% and
57.5%, respectively) and lower for blinding of participants and
personnel and incomplete outcome data (30.6% and 24.7%,
respectively) (fig 1⇓). The proportion of trials at high risk of
bias was 4.0% and 7.2% of all trials for sequence generation
and allocation concealment, respectively, but was 33.1% and
22.6% for blinding of participants and personnel and blinding
of outcome assessors, respectively, and 17.1% for incomplete
outcome data (fig 1⇓).
For all five risk of bias items, we found a lower proportion of
trials at unclear or high risk of bias in journals with high impact
factors than in those with low or no impact factor (fig 2⇓). For
allocation concealment, for example, 38.0% of trials published
in journals with impact factors ≥10 were at unclear risk of bias,
compared with 73.4% of those in journals with no impact factor.
We found the same trend when grouping the journals by centiles
of impact factor—45.9% for trials published in journals with
impact factors above the 90th centile v 73.4% in those with no
impact factor. The proportion of trials at high or unclear risk of
bias was lower for journals in the “medicine, general and
internal” category than for those in other categories and those
not indexed (fig 2⇓). We describe risk of bias for the 10 main
medical categories in web appendix 2.
A lower proportion of trials were at unclear or high risk of bias
in English journals than in non-English journals (web appendix
3). For allocation concealment, 55.7% and 6.6% of RCTs were
at unclear and high risk of bias in English journals, compared
with 73.7% and 12.5%, respectively, in non-English journals.

 Evolution of poor reporting and inadequate
methods over time
Evolution of poor reporting
The proportion of trials at unclear risk of bias decreased over
time, especially for sequence generation, which fell from 69.1%
in 1986-1990 to 31.2% in 2011-14, and for allocation
concealment, which fell from 70.1% to 44.6% in the same period
(fig 3⇓).
The fall in unclear risk of bias over time for sequence generation
and allocation concealment was consistent across all types of
journals but seemed more marked for journals with higher
impact factors (fig 4⇓) and for general journals compared with
specialist journals (web appendix 4).
The evolution of poor reporting for the 10 journals with the
most RCTs is shown in web appendix 5. All journals showed
an improvement over time but with differences between journals.
Evolution of inadequate methods
Evolution of inadequate methods over time is shown in fig 5⇓.
When considering all trials, including those considered at
unclear risk of bias, the change seems minimal. For sequence
generation, the proportion of trials at high risk of bias dropped
from 4.6% in 1986-1990 to 3.2% in 2011-14; for allocation
concealment, the proportion fell from 9.8% to 6.4% over the
same period. The decrease was greater after excluding trials at
unclear risk of bias, from 14.8% to 4.6% and from 32.7% to
11.6%, respectively. We found a slight decrease for blinding of
outcome assessors and incomplete outcome data, from 24.0%
to 20.3% and from 19.8% to 14.5%, respectively, when
considering all trials and from 42.0% to 30.6% and from 28.3%
to 18.7% after excluding trials at unclear risk of bias. By
contrast, the proportion of trials at high risk of bias for blinding
of participants and personnel slightly increased from 31.0% to
36.1% for all trials and from 47.3% to 49.3% after excluding
trials at unclear risk of bias. We found no clear difference in
evolution over time by journal impact factor (web appendix 6).
Discussion
We extensively mapped the research included in Cochrane
reviews and found a fall in poor reporting over time, especially
for sequence generation and allocation concealment. The
proportion of trials with inadequate methods has also decreased
slightly for these items. But we found important differences
between journals based on their impact factor and between
general and specialist journals. Our results raise concerns about
trials published in journals without impact factors, in light of
their high number (2976 trials; 14.2% of our sample) and the
prevalence of poor reporting and inadequate methods.
Strengths and weaknesses
We built a comprehensive database of primary research (RCTs)
by compiling a large amount of data routinely collected for
Cochrane systematic reviews. These data are of good quality,39
are standardised in part, and are available in an electronic format.
Using these data, we identified more than 20 000 RCTs and the
corresponding risk of bias assessments, which were collected
in duplicate by trained Cochrane reviewers. Although RCTs
included in Cochrane reviews do not represent all RCTs, they
cover a large and important body of evidence.31 32 We think that
research on such a large group of trials would not have been
possible without Cochrane reviews.
Our study has several limitations. We relied on Cochrane
reviewers’ assessments of risk of bias. Although reviewers
should be trained in use of the risk of bias tool, variability might
exist. For RCTs included in more than one review, we relied
on the risk of bias assessment in the most recent. We compared
this assessment with previous reviews for 1065 RCTs that shared
the same primary reference and found agreement in 83%
(n=881) and 75% (n=802) of RCTs for sequence generation and
allocation concealment, respectively. Most disagreements
concerned the distinction between low and unclear risk of bias.
Some Cochrane reviewers might contact study authors for
clarification and additional information for some methodological
elements that were not clearly reported in study reports. This
variability seems to be random and does not seem to be
correlated with the time of conduct of the review.
Reviewers might have excluded some trials because of
inadequate methods, leading us to underestimate the number of
studies with poor reporting and inadequate methods in
publications. We cannot exclude the possibility that a
classification bias might explain the differences by impact factor.
Cochrane reviewers might be influenced by the impact factor
of the journal when assessing the risk of bias, with attribution
of better scores to journals with the highest impact factors. We
think that this is more likely to affect the extreme categories
(impact factors ≥10 and no impact factor), and we observed a
clear trend for all categories.
We relied on the 2014 impact factor from Journal Citation
Reports, which could differ from that in the year the trial was
published. Finally, we focused on inadequate methods and poor
reporting and did not consider other important sources of waste
in RCTs, such as research questions not relevant to patients or
their doctors or failure to report trial results.3 7
Comparison with other studies
This study goes beyond previous literature on this topic with
assessment of changes over time and comparisons between
journals. Our results show the magnitude of poor reporting in
RCTs included in Cochrane reviews, with around half of these
RCTs considered at unclear risk of bias by the review authors
for sequence generation and allocation concealment, which
agrees with previous findings.13-41 We found an improvement
in reporting for these items over time, with the proportion of
trials at unclear risk of bias being halved over three decades,
which is consistent with the results of a study of variation in
risk of bias over time from a sample of 1732 RCTs included in
97 systematic reviews, published in 2012.40
We found a lower proportion of RCTs with poor reporting and
inadequate methods in journals with higher impact factors.
General medical journals seemed to be associated with lower
risk of bias and better reporting than specialist journals, but this
may be explained by the higher impact factors of general
medical journals.
Journal impact factor might be a surrogate for other factors.
Previous studies show that trials published in journals with high
impact factors are more likely to report methodological
safeguards against bias42 43 and to adhere to reporting guidelines
than those with lower impact factors.43 44 Journals with high
impact factors might have more technical resources, which can
help to ensure adherence to reporting guidelines by checking
submission of the checklist or might be used to detect selective
reporting of outcomes by checking information from clinical
trial registries. Moreover, journals with high impact factors
might be more engaged in quality improvement, with
methodologists involved in peer review. Finally, the selection

 of trials to be published might be more stringent in journals with
high impact factors. However, although some studies support
a relationship between impact factor and quality, 42-44 others
show no such relationship,45 andimpact factors remain
controversial.46 47 Publication in a journal with a high impact
factor does not ensure that an RCT is at low risk of bias.42
Trials published in a journal without an impact factor
represented 14.2% of all trials included in Cochrane reviews
we examined. Poor reporting and inadequate methods were
particularly common in these trials, with limited improvement
over time. Although impact factors should not be assumed to
represent journal quality, journals without an impact factor are
likely to be different from those that do have one. In our sample
we identified 1430 journals without impact factors, 52.0% of
which were non-English journals (compared with 9.7% of
journals with impact factors).
Implications
The improvements over time that we observed are encouraging
but could be better. Most of the waste related to poor reporting
or inadequate methods could be avoided. We previously showed
that half of the waste related to using inadequate methods could
be limited at the planning stage of the trial with simple and
inexpensive methodological adjustments.13 Waste related to
poor reporting could be completely avoided. Although using
reporting guidelines, such as the CONSORT checklist, is
associated with more complete reporting,48 49 their
implementation varies between journals44-52 with many journals
having no policy or mentioning only the existence of the
CONSORT statement in the instructions to authors.44-52 We need
to promote more active implementation, such as submission of
the checklist with the manuscript, as it has been associated with
better reporting.51
Research investigators and other stakeholders must also act
responsibly to report clear, transparent, and reliable research
findings.6 This responsibility can be communicated through
education and training starting at university and continuing
through residency, fellowship, and the various stages of a career
(for example, through professional societies and university
departments). Investigators should work with methodologists
from the planning stage of their trial to increase the likelihood
of adequate study design and quality of reporting.53 If having a
methodologist as a co-investigators is not possible, writing aid
tools might be useful.54
Our data provide an overview of the quality of evidence in
Cochrane reviews. Poor reporting and inadequate methods are
common in RCTs included in Cochrane reviews and might
affect their results and conclusions, as previous
meta-epidemiological studies have shown.8-12 Our results
highlight the importance of assessing risk of bias and of
incorporating this assessment in evidence synthesis.
Improvements at the trial level are necessary to improve the
quality of evidence provided by systematic reviews.
This study is part of a larger project, the next step of which is
to talk to journals either alone or perhaps grouped by specialty55
about whether this type of audit and feedback is useful to their
journal practice. Such data can serve an important monitoring
function, examining incremental changes in quality over time.
If our process could be automated, this might be a powerful tool
for funding agencies and others interested in assessing the value
of their research investments.1-56 Cochrane is uniquely placed
to observe the quality of research, as its data are routinely
collected with excellent quality assurance.
Conclusion
This extensive mapping of trials shows a decrease in waste
related to poor reporting and inadequate methods over time, but
with important differences between risk of bias items and
between journals. Our approach, based on the use of data already
collected by Cochrane for its reviews, could be a first step in
the development of a live observatory to monitor the quality of
research over time.

 What is already known on this subject
Poor reporting and inadequate methods are common in randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
Many methodological studies have evaluated the quality of reporting and risk of bias in RCTs, but they are limited in terms of number of
trials evaluated, most focusing on specific diseases, journals, or time periods.
What this study adds
We took advantage of the amount and quality of data included in Cochrane reviews to map the evolution of poor reporting and inadequate
methods in and between journals
From nearly 21 000 RCTs published in 3136 journals over three decades, our results show a decrease over time of poor reporting and
inadequate methods especially for sequence generation and allocation concealment
We found a lower proportion of RCTs with poor reporting and inadequate methods in journals with higher impact factors. By contrast, our
results raise concerns about journals without impact factors because of the prevalence of poor reporting and inadequate methods
The next step would be to provide feedback to journals and to evaluate whether this type of audit has an impact by using Cochrane data as
a live observatory to monitor changes over time
