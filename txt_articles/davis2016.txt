Abstract
Research is needed to investigate mechanisms linking work–family conflict to poor health in
working adults. We took a novel approach to build on extant studies by testing a potential mech-
anism in these associations – repetitive thought. Data came from a sample of 203 partnered
working adults. There were significant direct effects of work–family conflict with lower life sat-
isfaction, positive affect, and perceived health as well as greater fatigue. As for total effects,
work–family conflict was significantly associated with all health outcomes – life satisfaction, pos-
itive affect, negative affect, fatigue, perceived health, and chronic health conditions – in the
expected directions through repetitive thought. This study provides support that repetitive
thought is one potential mechanism of how work–family conflict can take a toll on psychological
and physical health. Findings are discussed in relation to improving workplace policies to improve
the health of working adults managing work–family conflict.

INTRODUCTION
Work–family conflict is pervasive in the U.S. Over the past several
decades, the number of employees who feel the time and energy
required for work interferes with their responsibilities at home has
been
steadily
increasing
(Galinsky,
Aumann,
&
Bond,
2009;
Nomaguchi, 2009). The nature of work has changed: Work days and
commute times have lengthened, advances in technology make
employees more accessible around the clock, and working at nonstan-
dard times has become common in many fields (Presser, 2005). These
changes, in turn, limit the time and energy employees have for their
parents, spouses, and children. Thus, the demands of work and family
inevitably conflict with one another. Work and family are the most
salient
contexts
for
adult
health
and
development
(Moen
&
Wethington, 1999), yet current social and workplace policies make it
difficult for employees to manage both. With limited support,
employees with greater work–family conflict are at risk for a host of
psychological and physical health problems (Allen, Herst, Bruck, &
Sutton, 2000).
Responding to a call by Allen et al. (2000), we integrate research
on stress and the work–family interface with the goal to “inform
work‐family researchers on the intervening and moderating factors
that may determine who is most likely to stay healthy while
experiencing work‐family conflict” (p. 301). A common response to
stress is repetitive thought, a “process of thinking attentively, repeti-
tively, or frequently about one’s self and one’s world” (Segerstrom,
Stanton, Alden, & Shortridge, 2003, p. 909). Given how salient both
work and family roles are in adults’ lives, when conflict arises from
the two, this conflict is likely at the forefront of one’s mind –
whether and how one can fix the issue causing the conflict and the
potential consequences of the conflict. Consequently, it may be diffi-
cult to redirect attention when an individual perceives no ideal reso-
lution to the conflict. Repetitive thought, which is associated with
rumination and worry, is related with poorer physical and mental
health (Segerstrom et al., 2003), and thus could explain the docu-
mented link between work–family conflict and health. For example,
an employee who is faced with needing to stay late to meet a dead-
line but at the same time needs to pick up his children before the
daycare closes, may incessantly think about how his work and family
demands are incompatible. The repetitive thoughts about the conflict
could heighten arousal leading to poor psychological and physical
health in the short‐ and long‐term.

WORK–FAMILY CONFLICT AND HEALTH
Since the 1980s, there has been an exponential growth in the num-
ber of studies investigating the health implications of work–family
conflict, a “form of interrole conflict in which the role pressures from
the work and family domains are mutually incompatible in some
respect” (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985, p. 77). According to role con-
flict theory, individuals experience strain when faced with a stressful
conflict. Greenhaus, Allen, and Spector (2006) present a theoretical
model that depicts how extensive job and family demands lead to
strain – evidenced by negative emotions, life dissatisfaction, and poor
physical health – through work–family conflict. With some excep-
tions, predominantly cross‐sectional studies have provided partial
support for this model.
In terms of psychological health, work–family conflict has been
linked to psychological distress, life satisfaction, depressive symptoms,
and anxiety (Amstad, Meier, Fasel, Elfering, & Semmer, 2011; Frone,
Russell, & Barnes, 1996; Kinnunen, Geurts, & Mauno, 2004; Netemyer
et al., 1996). Further, Frone (2000) found that work–family conflict
was associated with clinical diagnoses of mood, anxiety, and substance
dependence disorders. In fact, individuals experiencing work–family
conflict were 1.99 to 3.13 times more likely to have these disorders
compared to individuals with no work–family conflict. For the present
study, we included three psychological health indicators – life satisfac-
tion, positive affect, and negative affect – in the model.
Work–family conflict has also been associated with a number of
strain‐based, physical health outcomes (Allen et al., 2000), including
fatigue (Jansen, Kant, Kristensen, & Nijhuis, 2003), somatic complaints
(Adams & Jex, 1999; Netemeyer, Boles, & McMurrian, 1996), elevated
blood pressure (Thomas & Ganster, 1995), and overall physical health
(Frone et al., 1996). Although some studies have not found a significant
link between work–family conflict and health (Frone, Russell & Cooper,
1997), the majority of studies lend support to work–family conflict
having deleterious effects on health. In our path model, we tested
repetitive thought as a mediator in the association between work–
family conflict and three physical health indicators – fatigue, overall
perceived health, and health conditions.

REPETITIVE THOUGHT AS A
MECHANISM
To date, the majority of studies have only examined associations
between work–family conflict and health; studies examining mecha-
nisms that may explain the associations between work–family conflict
and health are scarce (Eby, Casper, Lockwood, Bordeaux, & Brinley,
2005). Understanding mechanisms are crucial for interventions to
reduce the effects of work–family conflict on employee health, espe-
cially as reports of work–family conflict continue to increase. We build
on Greenhaus et al. (2006) model of the health consequences of work–
family conflict by considering the role of individuals’ cognitions in the
process. Cognition has largely been ignored in conceptual models of
work–family conflict (i.e., explicitly modeled or discussed) despite
research documenting how cognition can impact individual well‐being.
Therefore, studies need to test “cognitions as mediating variables in
the work‐family conflict/work‐family facilitation‐well‐being indicators
relationship” (Turliuc & Buliga, 2014, p. 89). Specifically, we propose
that work–family conflict leads to repetitive thinking about the con-
flict, thereby prolonging exposure to the stressor, which results in poor
psychological and physical health.
Repetitive thoughts may explain immediate and long‐term psycho-
logical and physiological responses to stressors, such as conflicts that
arise between work and family roles (Brosschot, Gerin, & Thayer,
2006). Repetitive thoughts could focus on any of three forms of
work–family conflict (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985). For time‐based con-
flicts, an individual may be unable to stop thinking about how an
upcoming work presentation and an important children’s school per-
formance are at the same time, and neither can be rescheduled. An
individual may continue to try to think about solutions or potential
repercussions for choosing one over the other. For strain‐based con-
flicts, an individual may constantly think about he is exhausted from
work and does not feel he has the energy to take care of his parent
after work and this troubles him, leading to an increase in negative
affect. For behavior‐based conflict, an individual may persistently
dwell on how her maternal behavior at work may be disapproved by
her colleagues and cost her an assignment.
Stressors heighten arousal, making it difficult to concentrate on
anything other than the source of stress (Fryer & Warr, 1984).
Indeed, MacEwen and Barling (1994, p. 246) stated that “inter‐role
conflict is by definition over‐arousing.” Repetitive thinking can pro-
long or exacerbate exposure to a stressor. In fact, people who
engage in negative repetitive thinking “re‐create” negative experi-
ences in their minds based on memories of past events and antici-
pated future events. Negative thoughts can themselves perpetuate
chronic stress by reactivating negative emotional and physiological
responses long after the eliciting event has ceased (e.g., Brosschot
et al., 2006; Smyth, Zawadzki, & Gerin, 2013; Ursin & Eriksen,
2004). The inability to control one’s thoughts about the event, in
turn, leads to greater reactivity to stress, depressive symptoms, and
poor physical health (Brosschot et al., 2006; Stawski, Mogle, &
Sliwinski, 2011; Watkins, 2008).
Still unknown is the extent to which repetitive thoughts about a
work–family conflict are related to poor health outcomes. Work‐
related rumination, a nascent, yet burgeoning, area of research, can
help inform our hypotheses as rumination is closely related to repeti-
tive thought. Frone (2015) defines negative work rumination as “pre-
occupation with and repetitive thoughts focused on negative work
experiences that may extend beyond the workday” (p. 150). To date,
research has shown that work stressors, including time pressure and
conflicts with customers, are associated with greater rumination
(Berset, Elfering, Luthy, Luthi, & Semmer, 2011; Frone, 2015). Work‐
related rumination, in turn, has been linked to poorer employee sleep
quality, fatigue (Berset et al., 2011; Querstret & Cropley, 2012), and
alcohol use (Frone, 2015). Furthermore, rumination is implicated in
the workplace recovery process. Only recently has there been a
burgeoning area of research focused on workplace recovery to explain
the relation between work stress and health impairment (Berset et al.,
2
DAVIS ET AL.
 2011; Cropley, Dijk, & Stanley, 2006; Geurts & Sonnentag, 2006) and
psychological detachment (Sonnentag, Mojza, Binnewies, & Scholl,
2008). Maladaptive and repetitive thinking is proposed as one mecha-
nism that can interfere with successful recovery from stress during and
after work (i.e., the ability to “unwind”; Berset et al., 2011; Cropley,
Dijk, & Stanley, 2006; Geurts & Sonnentag, 2006). Those with time
intensive and otherwise demanding jobs have the most difficulty
recovering from work (Geurts & Sonnetag, 2006).
Work–family conflict, a type of stressor, could mirror the patterns
with work and repetitive thought above. Back to the original scenario,
an individual experiencing an unresolved conflict (e.g., need to work
late, but the daycare closes at 6 P.M. sharp) would then think about
the issue constantly until resolved (and no longer a conflict). Repetitive
thinking keeps the stressor ever present and, in turns, impairs an indi-
vidual’s well‐being. No study known to the authors has specifically
investigated either work–family conflict as a source of repetitive
thought or whether repetitive thought explains, at least partially, the
documented link between work–family conflict and health. Therefore,
the present study makes a novel and important contribution to the
work–family literature.

PRESENT STUDY
In sum, the present study had one primary research question: Do
repetitive thoughts explain the association between work–family con-
flict and health? We expect that repetitive thoughts will at least par-
tially explain the association between work–family conflict and the
psychological and physical indicators of health, such that work–family
conflict will be associated with more repetitive thinking and, in turn,
poorer health. Specifically, we expected that through repetitive
thought, work–family conflict would be negatively associated with life
satisfaction, positive affect, and perceived health but positively associ-
ated with negative affect, fatigue, and chronic conditions.

Participants and procedures
Participants for this study were recruited as a part of a larger study on
the health effects of environmental and work contexts in rural commu-
nities. Specifically, a survey research center mailed a brief survey, con-
sent form, and $2 pre‐incentive to a 1,250 random local residents in
the designated catchment areas. Of the 785 participants who com-
pleted the first brief survey, 632 agreed to complete a second, longer
mailed survey with additional measures of health and community
experiences. Of the 632 who initially agreed, 553 completed the sec-
ond survey that was mailed immediately after the first was returned.
In the current study, we used data only from individuals who indi-
cated that they were currently employed and were living with a roman-
tic partner (N = 203). Our sample consisted of 78.8% men, with the
majority of the sample being Non‐Hispanic and White (98%), which
reflects the demographic composition of the area from which the sam-
ple was drawn. Most of the participants were married to their first
spouse (76.4%; 17.7% were remarried, 5.9% were cohabiting) and
had at least one child currently living in the household (65.5%). The
median household income of the sample was in the range of $50 K
to $75 K and participants were 47.8 years of age on average (SD = 9.83,
range 24 to 76). The educational background of the participants was
varied: 3% did not complete high school, 34.5% completed high school,
17.7% had some college education, 30.0% completed college, and
14.3% attended some graduate or professional school after college.
The most frequent jobs held by participants in this sample were in
the manufacturing, construction, and sales industries.

Means, standard deviations, and reliability alphas for the final scales
are presented in Table 1, along with correlations between the scales
and the covariates.

Work‐to‐family conflict
Participants’ experiences of work–family conflict were assessed using
the work‐to‐family conflict scale (Netermeyer, Boles, & McMurrian,
1996; the work‐to‐family conflict subscale was not administered). This
measure assesses the degree to which the responsibilities of the work-
place interfere with the responsibilities tied to one’s family using five
items (e.g., the amount of time my job takes up makes it difficult to fulfill
family responsibilities). Participants rated their agreement with each
item on a 5‐point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly
agree). Items were averaged for analysis such that higher scores indi-
cate greater work–family conflict.

|
Repetitive thought
Participants’ experiences of repetitive thought were assessed using
15‐item White Bear Suppression Inventory (Wegner & Zanakos,
1994). Using a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly
agree), participants indicated their experiences of repetitive, intrusive
thoughts (e.g., “I have thoughts that I cannot stop”) and difficulties in
controlling these thoughts. Items were averaged for analysis such that
higher numbers indicate more repetitive thoughts.

Psychological health
Life satisfaction was assessed using the Satisfaction with Life Scale
(Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985), which is a five‐item mea-
sure of people’s overall satisfaction with their lives. Participants rated
their agreement with each item on a 7‐point scale ranging from 1
(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). An example item is “I am satis-
fied with my life.” Scores on the five items were averaged for analysis,
with higher scores indicating higher satisfaction with life. Positive
affect was measured by items from the Profile of Mood States
(POMS; McNair, Lorr, & Droppelman, 1981), which consists of six
items that assess a participants’ experiences of positive emotions
(e.g., happy, cheerful, and relaxed) over the past seven days. Negative
affect was measured using seven items about negative emotions
experiences over the past seven days (e.g., fearful, uneasy, and worth-
less) from Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Sys-
tem (PROMIS; Cella et al., 2007). For both scales, each item was rated

 on a 5‐point scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). We averaged
positive affect and negative affect items separately for analysis, with
higher scores indicating greater experiences of positive and negative
affect, respectively.

Physical health
We used two items adapted from PROMIS (Cella et al., 2007) for par-
ticipants to indicate their feelings of fatigue over the past seven days
using two items (e.g., how fatigued were you on average). Items were
rated on a 5‐point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much)
and were averaged for analysis such that higher scores indicate higher
fatigue. Perceived health was assessed using a single item from
PROMIS (Cella et al., 2007) that assessed participants’ overall percep-
tions of their health (i.e., in general, how would you rate your health). Par-
ticipants responded to the item using a 5‐point scale ranging from 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent). In order to assess physical health, we created a
measure to assess the number of health conditions participants had.
Participants were provided with a list of 22 different types of health
conditions/problems (e.g., high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes, etc.),
and indicated whether they had each condition (yes = 1, no = 0). Scores
were added to create a measure of the number of health conditions for
each participant with higher numbers indicating a greater number of
health problems (range = 0 to 9).

Covariates
We tested five variables as potential covariates for the models –
gender, age, income, socioeconomic index, and study location. With
the exception of study location, each has been found to be significantly
associated with the health outcomes in previous research. For example,
compared to men, repetitive thought was more strongly related to a
decrease in positive affect and an increase in negative affect for women
(Brans, Koval, Verduyn, Lim, & Kuppens, 2013). Age differences are evi-
dent in positive and negative affect (e.g., Charles, Reynolds, & Gatz,
2001), and physical health, health impairments, and conditions increase
with age. As for study location, we wanted to ensure participants from
the two study locations did not differ on the health indicators, thus
ruling out location as a third variable influence.
Gender (0 = male, 1 = female) was not a significant covariate in the
analyses for any of the outcomes and thus, was eliminated from the
final models. Age was entered as a continuous variable (M = 47.8,
SD = 9.83, range 24–76) and was a significant predictor of the number
of health conditions participants reported and was close to being mar-
ginally significant in the model for life satisfaction (p = .11). Participants
reported their household income on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 = less than
$10 k, 10 = $200 k or more) and income was a significant predictor
of life satisfaction. Location of data collection was also dummy coded
(1 = Ohio Basin, 2 = Susquehanna Basin) and was a significant covariate
in the analysis for negative affect. Finally, we also controlled for partic-
ipants’ socioeconomic index, which was calculated using the Socioeco-
nomic Index for Occupations (Hauser & Warren, 1996; M = 35.83,
SD = 11.79, range 20.12–63.83). Socioeconomic index was a signifi-
cant covariate in the analyses for all outcomes, except for participants’
number of health conditions. In order to maintain consistency across

Preliminary analyses
Prior to conducting our main analyses, we wanted to ensure that all
of our scales had acceptable measurement properties and were unidi-
mensional measures of the constructs. Thus, for all scales where this
was possible (i.e., repetitive thought, work–family conflict, life satis-
faction,
positive
affect,
negative
affect,
and
fatigue),
we
first
inspected the inter‐item correlations of the scale items and eliminated
items that correlated .40 or less with other items in the scale (Hinkin,
1998). This resulted in dropping two items from the negative affect
and thought intrusion scales and one item from the positive affect
scale (full details of all preliminary analyses are available upon request
from the second author). We then conducted exploratory factor anal-
ysis on the remaining items of each scale using principal axis factoring
extraction with oblimin rotation. We inspected the scree plots to
identify the number of factors to retain for each scale and also used
the Kaiser criterion of having an eigenvalue of at least 1 for a factor
to be retained (Hinkin, 1998; Worthington & Whittaker, 2006). Both
methods identified a single factor underlying each scale. We next
conducted confirmatory factor analysis on each of the scales and
model fit indices showed that the measurement models fit the data
adequately for each scale. Thus, we used the aggregate scores for
each construct based on the final items retained in each of the scales
to conduct our primary analysis.

Analytic plan
For our primary analysis, we ran a path model using the software Mplus
(Muthén & Muthén, 2010). We were primarily interested in testing
whether work–family conflict was associated with the health out-
comes, and whether some of that association would be mediated
through repetitive thought. We tested the significance of all mediated
paths using the model indirect command in Mplus and obtained 95%
confidence
intervals
for
the
estimated
indirect
effects
using
bootstrapping with 5,000 resamples. For each estimate in the model,
we report the unstandardized coefficients along with their standard
errors and 95% confidence intervals. When confidence intervals do
not include zero as a value, the estimate is statistically significant at
p < .05. In order to evaluate the overall fit of the mediation model,
we used the χ2 where nonsignificant values indicate good model fit,
CFI where values above .95 indicate good fit, RMSEA where values
below .06 indicate good fit, and the SRMR where values below .08
indicate good fit (Kline, 2010).
In addition to the primary mediation model with the six different
health outcomes, the model also included the covariates (i.e., age,
income, socioeconomic index, and study location) that were signifi-
cant predictors for at least one outcome. Furthermore, we also
allowed each of the health outcomes to covary with one another, as
we expected that most of them would be associated with one
another.

Primary analysis
First, we examined overall fit of the model to the data. Model fit indi-
ces indicated that our model fit the data well, χ2 (4) = 5.02, p = .29,
CFI = .997, RMSEA = .065, SRMR = .023. Second, consistent with
our expectations, work–family conflict was a significant predictor of
higher repetitive thoughts (B = .23, SE = .07, CI: .09 to .35). Further-
more, work–family conflict was also directly associated with lower life
satisfaction (B = −.27, SE = .07, CI: −.40 to −.12), lower positive affect
(B = −.10, SE = .04, CI: −.18 to −.01), marginally higher negative affect
(B = .09 SE = .05, CI: −.01 to .18, p = .077), higher fatigue (B = .19,
SE = .06, CI: .08 to .29), and marginally worse perceived health
(B = −.12, SE = .06, CI: −.24 to .002, p = .055). Work–family conflict
was not directly associated with the number of health conditions
reported (B = .23, SE = .15, CI: −.05 to .52, p = .116).
Next, we examined the links between repetitive thoughts and
each of the health outcomes. Repetitive thoughts were associated

cal and physical health from work–family

 with lower life satisfaction (B = −.21, SE = .09, CI: −.38 to −.05), lower
positive affect (B = −.20, SE = .06, CI: −.32 to −.08), higher negative
affect (B = .25, SE = .06, CI: .14 to .37), higher fatigue (B = .28, SE = .07,
CI: .14 to .41), lower perceived health (B = −.17, SE = .07, CI: −.30 to
−.04), and more reported health conditions (B = .44, SE = .15, CI: .14
to .75). Finally, we examined whether the indirect, mediated paths
from work–family conflict to each of the health outcomes, through
repetitive thought, were significant. As expected, repetitive thought
was a significant mediator of the path between work–family conflict
and life satisfaction (although this effect was marginal; B = −.05,
SE = .03, CI: −.11 to −.01, p = .059), positive affect (B = −.05, SE = .02,
CI: −.10 to −.02), negative affect (B = .06, SE = .02, CI: .02 to .12),
fatigue (B = .06, SE = .02, CI .03 to .12), perceived health (B = −.04,
SE = .02, CI: −.09 to −.01), and number of health conditions (B = .10,
SE = .05, CI: .03 to .22).

DISCUSSION
Managing work–family conflict is an important part of a healthy life.
Work–family conflict may continue to increase as it has done in the
past few decades (Galinsky et al., 2009; Nomaguchi, 2009), which
makes it crucial to understand the intervening factors in the link
between work–family conflict and health. Strengths of this study
include investigating an intervening factor (Allen et al., 2000) and
building on theoretical models of the health consequences of work–
family conflict (Greenhaus et al., 2006) to consider individuals’ cogni-
tions, specifically repetitive thinking.
Previous research has shown that work–family conflict is associ-
ated with indicators of poorer psychological and physical health (e.g.,
Allen et al., 2000). We found similar patterns in our sample. Indeed,
work–family conflict was associated with lower life satisfaction and
positive affect (i.e., direct effects), similar to previous research (e.g.,
Kinnunen et al., 2004). Although there was not a significant direct
effect of work–family conflict on negative affect as several studies
have shown (Judge, Ilies, & Scot, 2006), the results were in the
expected direction and the total effect of work–family conflict on neg-
ative affect was significant. As for physical health, there were direct
effects of work–family conflict on fatigue and perceived health, as past
studies (e.g., Jansen et al., 2003) have found, as well as chronic health
conditions.
The main objective of this study was to test a conceptual model in
which repetitive thought explained the association between work–
family conflict and health. This is the first study known to the authors
to test and find support for repetitive thought as an intervening vari-
able in the work–family conflict‐health link. There was support for
repetitive thought as a mediator in the association between work–
family conflict and all six health outcomes. Repetitive thought
explained the association between work‐to‐family conflict and psycho-
logical health, namely life satisfaction, positive, and negative affect.
Because work–family conflict was not directly associated with nega-
tive affect, the path model results indicate the positive association
between work–family conflict and negative affect might be fully
accounted for by higher levels of repetitive thought. Furthermore,
the strong correlation and path results suggest repetitive thought
and negative affect likely share an underlying common process
(Segerstrom et al., 2003; Watkins & Moulds, 2009). Repetitive thought
also explained the association between work–family conflict and all
three physical health outcomes – fatigue, perceived health, and chronic
conditions. Stressors heighten physiological and psychological arousal,
and work–family conflict can be of particular concern given that it “is
by definition over‐arousing” (MacEwen & Barling, 1994, p. 246).
Work–family conflict can have deleterious effects on physical and psy-
chological health due to the continual arousal and prolonged exposure
to this stressor (Brosschot et al., 2006; Smyth et al., 2013; Ursin &
Eriksen, 2004). Repetitive thought can explain immediate responses,
such as daily positive and negative affect, to more long‐term out-
comes, such as chronic fatigue and health conditions (Brosschot
et al., 2006). Repetitive thought should be added to current theoretical
models of the health consequences of work–family conflict (e.g.,
Greenhaus et al., 2006).

Practical implications
Given the continual rise in work–family conflict (Galinsky et al. 2009;
Nomaguchi, 2009), it is important to understand how workers cope
with work–family conflict and how prolonged and repeated exposure
impacts health. Unconstructive repetitive thought is a maladaptive
coping strategy and can impede successful daily recovery (Watkins,
2008). Successful recovery is critical in preventing negative health
implications (Guerts & Sonnentag, 2006). Practitioners can assist indi-
viduals facing the dual demands of work and family by reducing repet-
itive thought, and related issues of worry and rumination. One method
is mindfulness, which is “intentionally paying attention to present‐
moment experience (physical sensations, perceptions, affective states,
thoughts, and imagery) in a nonjudgmental way, thereby cultivating a
stable and nonreactive awareness” (Carmody, Reed, Kirsteller, &
Merriem, 2008, p. 394, emphasis added). Mindfulness involves notic-
ing but not ruminating about events (Brown, Ryan, & Creswell,
2007). Allen and Kiburz (2012) found that mindfulness was associated
with greater work–family balance, thus mindfulness training may pre-
vent work–family conflict or may prevent rumination or repetitive
thinking in the face of conflict, thus eliminating deleterious health
implications over time. As such, mindfulness training could be a clinical
intervention (Baer, 2003) as well as a workplace intervention. Mindful-
ness training at work could assist with stressors more broadly at work
and combat against potential co‐rumination, or excessive discussion
about stressors, among coworkers (Haggard, Robert, & Rose, 2011)
and promote individual health and job performance (e.g., Poulin,
Mackenzie, Soloway, & Karayolas, 2008).
In addition to mindfulness training, increasing supervisor support
for personal and family life can help prevent and/or mitigate the
potentially noxious effects of work–family conflict. Abusive supervi-
sion can exacerbate the effects of co‐rumination, particularly for
women (Haggard et al., 2011) and family supportive supervisor behav-
iors can reduce work–family conflict (Thomas & Ganster, 1995).
Indeed, an intervention aimed at increasing schedule control and
increasing supervisors’ support for personal and family life significantly
reduced employees’ experiences of work–family conflict (Kelly et al.,
2014). Mindfulness training in the context of a supportive work

 environment could be especially beneficial to employees as well as
their employers through a return on investment.

LIMITATIONS
As with most extant studies testing the associations between
work–family conflict and health, our study is limited by the cross‐
sectional, self‐report design. Longitudinal studies are needed to test
directionality in the associations and to understand the accumu-
lated costs of stress‐related illnesses and the role of repetitive
thought in the etiology of illness and disease. Including more
objective health measures or more clinically significant outcomes
would address issues of self‐report bias and provide more confi-
dence in the findings.
In addition to the study design, future studies should use larger,
more representative samples. First, the sample size is relatively small
and, therefore, the possibility exists that the statistically significant
effects may be spurious or their size overestimated (e.g., Ioannidis,
2008). As such, this model should be tested with a much larger sam-
ple. Furthermore, the sample demographics limit generalizability. We
were unable to detect gender differences in these models because
the sample was largely male. Given that some research shows that
women experience greater work–family conflict (van Veldhoven &
Beijer, 2012) and that rumination is more strongly linked to positive
and negative affect for women than men (Brans et al., 2013), future
studies should further investigate the role of gender in work–family
conflict, repetitive thought, and health. Additionally, this sample is
comprised of mostly White, fairly educated, males dwelling in a rural
community, which limits the generalizability of these findings. Future
studies should replicate this study with a larger, more heterogeneous
sample.
Furthermore, given the measure we used, we cannot distinguish
between the different facets of repetitive thought. Wegner and
Zanakos’ (1994) White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI) has
received scrutiny regarding its psychometric properties. Similar to
Muris, Merckelbach, & Horselenberg, (1996), we found a single fac-
tor solution, yet others have found evidence for a two‐ or three‐
factor structure including the experience of repetitive, intrusive
thoughts (e.g., “I have thoughts that I cannot stop”) as well as
thought suppression attempts (e.g., “I always try to put problems
out of my mind”). Rassin (2003) found a three‐factor solution for
the WBSI that also included successful (versus failed attempts at)
thought suppression. Thus, despite the high reliability of the WBSI
and confirmed hypothesized pathways in our study, future studies
should build on the present study by refining the measurement to
better understand what it is specifically about repetitive thought
that connects work–family conflict to poorer health outcomes.
Segerstrom et al.’s (2003) study provided evidence for four dimen-
sions of repetitive thought, including positive versus negative con-
tent valence, searching versus solving purpose, total amount of
repetitive thought, and interpersonal versus achievement domain.
Also, although negative repetitive thoughts tend to be more salient,
emerging research by Segerstrom et al. (2003) and Frone (2015)
points to considering how work–family balance or facilitation may
lead to positive repetitive thoughts, and in turn, healthful outcomes.
Furthermore, future studies should examine other potential cognitive
variables, such as psychological detachment, that may yield insight
into the work–family conflict‐health link.
Finally, this study only examined work‐to‐family conflict; the
intersection between work and family is bi‐directional and future
studies should test the conceptual model with family‐to‐work con-
flict which also has implications for health and job performance
(Eby et al., 2005).

CONCLUSION
In order to improve policies and design targeted interventions to alle-
viate this source of stress in adults’ lives, it is important to understand
the potential mechanisms linking work–family conflict to health. The
present study demonstrated that repetitive thought is a potential
mechanism explaining the negative health implications of work–family
conflict. Preventing work–family conflict and repetitive thinking may
be a fruitful way to support employees with return on investments
for employers. With work–family conflict on the rise, it is imperative
scholars continue to investigate potential conceptual and theoretical
models to find the appropriate timing and target of interventions to
reduce work–family conflict in individuals’ lives.
