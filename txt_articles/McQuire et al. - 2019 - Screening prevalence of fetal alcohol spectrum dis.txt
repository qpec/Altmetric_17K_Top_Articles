Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are lifelong disabilities caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Prenatal
alcohol use is common in the UK, but FASD prevalence was unknown. Prevalence estimates are essential for
informing FASD prevention, identification and support.
We applied novel screening algorithms to existing data to estimate the screening prevalence of FASD. Data
were from a population-based cohort study (ALSPAC), which recruited pregnant women with expected delivery
dates between 1991 and 1992 from the Bristol area of the UK. We evaluated different missing data strategies by
comparing results from complete case, single imputation (which assumed that missing data indicated no ex-
posure and no impairment), and multiple imputation methods.
6.0% of children screened positive for FASD in the analysis that used the single imputation method (total
N = 13,495), 7.2% in complete case analysis (total N = 223) and 17.0% in the analysis with multiply imputed
data (total N = 13,495). A positive FASD screen was more common among children of lower socioeconomic
status and children from unplanned pregnancies. Our analyses showed that the complete case and single im-
putation methods that are commonly used in FASD prevalence studies are likely to underestimate FASD pre-
valence.
Although not equivalent to a formal diagnosis, these screening prevalence estimates suggest that FASD is
likely to be a significant public health concern in the UK. Given current patterns of alcohol consumption and
recent changes in prenatal guidance, active case ascertainment studies are urgently needed to further clarify the
current epidemiology of FASD in the general population of the UK.
1. Introduction
Prenatal alcohol use can lead to lifelong disabilities, known as fetal
alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) (British Medical Association
(BMA), 2016). FASD is an umbrella term that describes a range of
features including facial dysmorphia, growth deficiency and neurobe-
havioural impairment. It is associated with over 400 comorbid condi-
tions and adverse outcomes in later life (Popova et al., 2016; Streissguth
et al., 2004). FASD is a leading cause of developmental disability.
Studies from the USA and Europe suggest that 1% to 10% of children in
the general population have FASD (Lange et al., 2017a; Roozen et al.,
2016; May et al., 2018). In rural South Africa, up to 28% of children
have FASD (May et al., 2017).
Despite having the fourth highest estimated prevalence of prenatal
alcohol use worldwide (Popova et al., 2017), the prevalence of FASD in
the UK is unknown. In 2015/16, the All Party Parliamentary Group for
FASD and British Medical Association expressed an urgent need for a
UK population-based prevalence study to guide FASD prevention efforts
and policy for alcohol use in pregnancy (British Medical Association
(BMA), 2016; All Party Parliamentary Group on FASD, 2015). Active
case ascertainment methods, such as in-school screening methods, are
the preferred approach for FASD prevalence studies; however, they are

 costly and resource intensive (May et al., 2009). To date, proposals to
conduct active case ascertainment studies of FASD in the UK have not
been successful (All Party Parliamentary Group on FASD, 2015). To
address this knowledge gap, we developed novel FASD screening al-
gorithms and applied these to existing data from a population-based
birth-cohort in England to estimate FASD screening prevalence. We also
investigated the impact of using different missing data strategies when
estimating FASD prevalence.
2. Participants and methods
2.1. Data source
We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
Children (ALSPAC) cohort, a prospective population-based birth-cohort
study that recruited 14,541 pregnant women with expected delivery
dates between 1st April 1991 to 31st December 1992 from the Bristol
area of the UK (Boyd et al., 2013; Fraser et al., 2013). The ALSPAC
cohort includes extensive repeated measures of prenatal exposures,
developmental outcomes and sociodemographic factors, collected from
questionnaires, in-clinic assessments and data linkage. ALSPAC sample
characteristics, methodology and representativeness are described in
previous publications (Boyd et al., 2013; Fraser et al., 2013) and online
(http://www.alspac.bris.ac.uk/welcome/index.shtml). The study web-
site

2.2. Study approval
Ethical approval was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law
Committee (IRB00003312) and the Local Research Ethics Committees
(Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), 2018) and
study approval was granted by the ALSPAC Executive Committee on
March 2nd, 2016 (Project B2620).
2.3. Participants
We included data on all singleton pregnancies in the core ALSPAC
sample. We excluded children who were not alive at one year of age,
those with genetic conditions, and those who did not speak English as a
primary language. Participants who were in the armed forces social
class category were excluded due to sparse data, which led to an in-
ability to reach convergence in imputation models.
2.4. FASD screening algorithm development and validation
We used the FASD Canadian guidelines for diagnosis (2005)
(Chudley et al., 2005) to develop FASD screening algorithms. A detailed
description of algorithm development and validation is provided else-
where (McQuire, 2018). Appendix 1 provides full algorithm specifica-
tions. First, we identified ALSPAC measures relevant to the Canadian
FASD criteria. Second, we derived a series of algorithm specifications
that corresponded to different combinations of central nervous system
(CNS) and prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) criteria. Specifications for
the CNS criteria ranged from what we referred to as ‘Liberal’, ‘Mid’ and
‘Strict’ criteria, corresponding to increasing levels of convergent evi-
dence and symptom severity. Following the case conference validation
process (described below), we added a ‘Revised’ CNS category to reflect
modifications to the CNS criteria, following recommendations from the
panel. Similarly, the PAE specifications ranged from what we termed
‘Any’, ‘Mid’ and ‘Strict’, corresponding to increasing levels of exposure
(dose and/or duration). Any PAE was defined as any level of prenatal
alcohol exposure at any time in pregnancy; Mid PAE was defined as two
trimesters of prenatal alcohol exposure and/or binge drinking and Strict
PAE was defined as three trimesters of prenatal alcohol exposure and/
or binge drinking. We also tested other thresholds for PAE that have
been suggested in the literature (see Appendix 1). Third, we selected a
stratified random sample of 31 participant profiles to be considered by
an expert case-conference panel (see Appendix 2 for full details of the
case-conference sampling strategy). The expert panel included a con-
sultant psychiatrist from the UK National Clinic for FASD (RM), a
paediatrician (AK), and an educational psychologist (AH). The panel
were given the participant profiles and asked to decide whether, on the
balance of probability, a diagnosis of FASD would be made in clinic,
given the information provided. Panel members were blind to the FASD
classification status that had been assigned by the algorithms. Decisions

 were reached by consensus. We selected the algorithms with the
greatest levels of agreement with the expert panel for prevalence ana-
lyses.
2.5. Outcome
The primary outcome was total FASD screening prevalence, defined
as the proportion of participants who met criteria for any condition
within the FASD continuum, based on the FASD screening algorithm.
Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of FASD subtypes (described
in Fig. 1).
It is important to note that FASD diagnosis requires input from a
multidisciplinary team, with an opportunity to interact with the child
and their caregivers, to allow a thorough analysis of a child's devel-
opmental profile and consider differential diagnoses. For the purposes
of this research, ‘cases’ and ‘participants with FASD’ refer to children
who met the screening algorithm criteria for FASD. This is not
equivalent to a formal FASD diagnosis.
2.6. Statistical analyses
Analyses were conducted in Stata 14.2 (Stata Statistical Software
[computer program]. Release 14, 2015).
2.6.1. Algorithm validation
We calculated diagnostic accuracy statistics to quantify the level of
agreement between the FASD classifications that were made by the
expert panel and the algorithms. Algorithm performance was quantified
using sensitivity and specificity statistics and the 0,1 method, which
identifies the shortest distance to the top left-hand corner of a receiver
operating characteristic plot (Kelly et al., 2008). Lower values of the 0,1
statistic indicate better performance.
2.6.2. Missing data methods
To address the bias and imprecision introduced by missing data, and
to evaluate the impact of different missing data strategies, we produced
prevalence estimates using data from complete case, single and mul-
tiple imputation methods. We compared patterns of PAE and clinical
characteristics across each of the missing data strategies to investigate
how this influenced prevalence estimates (presented in Appendix 3).
In complete case analyses, we excluded all children who had
missing data on any of the measures that were included in the FASD
screening algorithm. In the single imputation method, we assumed that
missing PAE data indicated no exposure and that missing phenotype
data indicated no impairment. The multiple imputation model specifi-
cation (Royston, 2009) and missing data frequencies are presented in
Appendix 4.
2.7. Prevalence estimation
We generated prevalence estimates for total FASD and FASD sub-
types (fetal alcohol syndrome [FAS], partial fetal alcohol syndrome
[pFAS] and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder [ARND]) by
applying the FASD screening algorithms to the dataset. Total FASD
prevalence was defined as the number of participants in the eligible
sample who met criteria for any FASD subcategory, divided by the total
eligible sample. To ensure compliance with ALSPAC policy, we com-
bined prevalence estimates for the less common FASD subtypes (pFAS
and FAS) if fewer than five participants met criteria for one of these
categories and censored estimates when fewer than five participants
met criteria for the combined pFAS/FAS subcategory. We used the
Wilson method to generate confidence intervals for complete case and
singly imputed data (Newcombe, 1998). We used Rubin's combination
rules to derive prevalence estimates and confidence intervals for mul-
tiply imputed data (Little & Rubin, 2002).

 these, 13,495 were eligible for inclusion. This sample size was pre-
served using the single and multiple imputation missing data strategies.
Missing data led to a substantial reduction in the size of the complete
case sample (N = 223). Appendix 5 provides a comparison of partici-
pants with complete versus incomplete data.
3.1.1. Missing data patterns
The proportion of missing data ranged from 0% for maternal age,
gestational age at delivery, and sex of the child to 70% for teacher-
reported communication problems. Forty-nine percent of participants
had incomplete PAE data. Participants with complete data differed from
those with incomplete data on a range of characteristics, indicating that
data were not missing completely at random (Appendix 5). Compared
to those with complete data, mothers of children with incomplete data
were younger, were more likely to report that pregnancy was un-
planned, and were of lower socioeconomic status. During pregnancy,
mothers of children with incomplete data were less likely to report
drinking alcohol overall, but more likely to report binge drinking. They
were more likely to have smoked, and to have had significant depres-
sion and anxiety symptoms. Children with incomplete data had poorer
outcomes including lower IQ, conduct problems, and growth defi-
ciency.
3.2. FASD screening algorithm performance
Performance results for all algorithms are shown in Appendix 6. The
‘Mid CNS/Any PAE’ algorithm had the highest performance (0,1
value = 0.46; sensitivity 91%; specificity 55%). We selected this algo-
rithm to screen for FASD cases in our primary prevalence analyses.
To investigate the impact of applying different algorithms to the
data, we selected the two algorithms with the next best values of the 0,1
statistic to be used in sensitivity analyses. These were the ‘Mid CNS/Mid
PAE’ algorithm and ‘Revised CNS/Any PAE’ algorithms (both had 0,1
value = 0.47; sensitivity 64%; specificity 70%).
3.3. FASD screening prevalence
3.3.1. Complete case prevalence estimates
Based on the complete case sample (N = 223), 7.2% (95% CI
4.5%–11.3%) of children screened positive for FASD. We do not report
estimates for FASD subcategories as fewer than five participants met
criteria for pFAS/FAS.
3.3.2. Single imputation prevalence estimates
Using the singly imputed data (N = 13,495), 6.0% (95% CI
5.7%–6.5%) of children met criteria for FASD. ARND accounted for
5.8% (95% CI 5.5%–6.2%) of FASD cases and 0.2% (95% CI
0.1%–0.3%) met criteria for pFAS/FAS.
3.3.3. Multiple imputation prevalence estimates
In analyses with multiply imputed data (N = 13,495), 17.0% (95%
CI 16.1%–17.8%) of children met criteria for FASD. 15.4% (95%
14.4%–16.4%) met criteria for ARND and 1.6% (95% CI 1.1%–2.1%)
met criteria for pFAS/FAS.
3.3.3.1. Sensitivity analyses. Using a screening algorithm with the same
CNS criteria as the primary analyses, but more stringent PAE criteria
(the ‘Mid CNS/Mid PAE’ algorithm), we obtained a prevalence of 12.7%
(95% CI 11.9%–13.4%) for FASD. Using an algorithm with the same
PAE criteria as the primary analyses, but different CNS criteria (the
‘Revised CNS/Any PAE’ algorithm), we obtained a prevalence of 12.8%
(95% CI 12.0%–13.5%) for FASD.
3.4. Participant characteristics
Table 1 presents sociodemographic and pregnancy characteristics
and Table 2 presents PAE and clinical characteristics of the sample by
FASD status, using multiply imputed data. Seventy-nine percent of
mothers in the sample consumed alcohol during pregnancy. FASD was
more common among children whose mothers were of lower socio-
economic status. Children with FASD were more likely to be male and
to be born to mothers who reported that pregnancy was unplanned.
4. Discussion
The screen prevalence of FASD in this UK population-based sample
was 6.0% using singly imputed data, 7.2% in complete case analysis,
and 17.0% using multiply imputed data. The prevalence estimates,
based on the complete case and single imputation strategies, are
broadly consistent with the upper limits of other European studies,
which have produced FASD prevalence estimates in the region of 1% to
5% (Lange et al., 2017a; Roozen et al., 2016). Although these estimates
have some face validity, missing data patterns indicated that they were
likely to be biased, as data were not missing completely at random.
Participants with incomplete data experienced more adverse prenatal
exposures and had poorer developmental outcomes relevant to FASD.
Therefore, analyses with complete case and singly imputed data were
likely to underestimate FASD prevalence. The single imputation method
that we adopted (which assumed that missing data indicated no pre-
natal alcohol exposure and no impairment) is just one approach to
single imputation that has been used in FASD prevalence studies. Other
methods, for example where the imputed values could depend on other
observed variables, may have produced higher estimates of FASD pre-
valence, but would have underestimated standard error.
The FASD screening prevalence estimate of 17.0%, based on mul-
tiply imputed data, may be a more robust estimate, due to the ability of
this method to reduce bias due to missing data (Sterne et al., 2009).
This estimate is significantly higher than existing estimates from active
case ascertainment studies of FASD prevalence in Europe and the USA,
which report a maximum prevalence of 10% (Lange et al., 2017a;
Roozen et al., 2016; May et al., 2018), but lower than estimates from
South Africa, where FASD prevalence is up to 28% (May et al., 2017).
The UK has one of the highest levels of PAE in the world and, therefore,
it is plausible that FASD prevalence would be relatively high. The
pooled prevalence estimate for prenatal alcohol use is 15% in the USA,
compared to 41% in the UK (Popova et al., 2017). Recent prospective
studies produce higher estimates, suggesting that, consistent with re-
sults from this study, up to 79% of women in the UK drink while
pregnant, with 33% at binge levels (Nykjaer et al., 2014; O'Keeffe et al.,
2015).
4.1. FASD subtypes
ARND was the most common subtype of FASD, accounting for
15.4% of screen positive cases in analyses with multiply imputed data.
The screen prevalence of ARND in this sample is higher than existing
European estimates, while pFAS and FAS prevalence is lower. European
studies have produced estimates of up to 0.8% for ARND, 1.7% for FAS
and 5.0% for pFAS (May et al., 2006; May et al., 2011; Petkovic &
Barisic, 2010; Petkovic & Barisic, 2013; Okulicz-Kozaryn et al., 2017).
Simulation methods, based on PAE data, suggest that 0.6% of children
in the UK may have FAS (Popova et al., 2017). Therefore, our combined
prevalence estimate of 1.6% for pFAS/FAS may represent an under-
estimate. Facial scan data were collected at age 15 and evidence sug-
gests that the FAS facial features become less prominent over time
(Spohr et al., 1994). This may have led to reduced detection of pFAS/
FAS in this study, but will not have influenced total FASD prevalence
estimates.
The higher prevalence of ARND that we report, relative to the ex-
isting literature, may be explained partly by differences in study design.
Many existing active case ascertainment studies of FASD follow a tiered
screening

347
 neurobehavioural measures (May et al., 2006; May et al., 2011;
Okulicz-Kozaryn et al., 2017) and, consequently, ARND is likely to be
“severely undercounted” (May et al., 2011 (p. 2346)). Assessments of
child phenotype in the ALSPAC dataset are more extensive than those
that have been possible in active case ascertainment studies and this too
is likely to have contributed to higher prevalence estimates for FASD,
relative to existing studies. Furthermore, there is no universally ac-
cepted diagnostic framework for assessing FASD. Although there is
broad consensus on FASD subtypes and the core features, diagnostic
frameworks differ in the specific criteria, thresholds and nomenclature
used to define FASD. This leads to variations in FASD classifications and
subsequent prevalence estimates throughout the literature (Coles et al.,
2016).
4.2. Strengths and limitations
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate FASD
screening prevalence in a UK-based general population sample. It pro-
vides a novel approach to FASD case ascertainment for epidemiological
studies, including the use of multiple imputation methods to reduce the
bias and imprecision introduced by missing data; the development and
application of new screening algorithms for FASD; and the validation of
these algorithms using blind expert panel review.
The study design had the following advantages. It is likely to in-
crease capture of the full spectrum of FASD, since it did not rely on
dysmorphology screening as a gateway to recruitment; it facilitated a
large population-based investigation of FASD using a comprehensive
range of measures to assess child phenotype in a manner that was
significantly less costly and resource intensive than traditional active
case ascertainment methods; and, as it used existing data, it could be
conducted without additional consent, which maximised participation
rates. Therefore, given that it has not yet been possible to conduct an
active case ascertainment study of FASD in the UK, the method de-
scribed in this study arguably provided the best currently available
means of exploring the epidemiology of FASD at the population level.
However, there are important limitations. Classifications by the
screening algorithms are not equivalent to a formal FASD diagnosis. An
ideal clinical assessment for FASD would include a specialised in-person

 evaluation with relevant assessments completed at the same time, in-
cluding genetic microarray testing to support differential diagnosis.
Given the opportunity for a gold standard clinical assessment, it is
possible that some of the children would not be considered to have
FASD. That said, since self-reported prenatal alcohol use is likely to be
underreported, some children with FASD may have not been identified
by the screening algorithms.
Other limitations stem from the concept of FASD as a whole. The
only feature of FASD that is specific to PAE is the facial phenotype. To
date, a unique neurobehavioural profile for FASD has not been de-
termined (Lange et al., 2017b). As the FASD Canadian guidelines for
diagnosis note, “the face of FAS is the result of a specific effect of
ethanol teratogenesis altering growth of the midface and brain. Those
exposed to other embryotoxic agents may display a similar, but not
identical, phenotypic facial development, impaired growth, a higher
frequency of anomalies and developmental and behavioural abnorm-
alities… Knowledge of exposure history will decrease the possibility of
misdiagnosing FASD.” (Chudley et al., 2005 (pS7)). While we in-
corporated expert clinical judgement in our algorithm specification and
validation process, it was not feasible to conduct individualised as-
sessments of FASD. Therefore, in the simplest terms, the screening
prevalence estimates reported in this study indicate that at least 6% of
children were exposed to alcohol prenatally and had evidence of sig-
nificant CNS impairment. It is not possible to prove conclusively that
PAE was the key causal factor in determining the outcomes of these
children. Equally, it is not possible to rule out alcohol as an important
causal factor.
The validity of the prevalence estimates necessarily depend on the
validity of the screening algorithms. Specificity estimates indicated that
the ‘Mid CNS/Any PAE’ primary screening algorithm may have over-
estimated FASD, due to a high proportion of false positive results. Our
selection of an algorithm that required evidence of any level of PAE as
sufficient for consideration for FASD is consistent with the views of the
expert validation panel, current antenatal guidelines, which re-
commend abstinence from alcohol as the safest option during preg-
nancy, and with evidence that suggests that there is no known safe level
of PAE. Multiple co-occurring risk factors and maternal characteristics
influence blood alcohol concentrations, the duration of fetal alcohol
exposure and, therefore, alcohol teratogenicity. This has led some to
question whether it will ever be possible to determine a ‘safe’ threshold
for PAE (Clarren & Cook, 2016). Nevertheless, we recognise that it is
unlikely that all children with CNS impairment and any level of alcohol
exposure in pregnancy will have FASD through causative mechanisms.
The apparently low specificity values may also be due to an im-
perfect
reference
standard.
Qualitative
data,
reported
elsewhere
(McQuire, 2018), suggested that many of the profiles that were classi-
fied as ‘not FASD’ by the panel were considered possible cases, subject
to further investigation. Therefore, it seemed reasonable to favour high
sensitivity, rather than high specificity, when choosing which of the
algorithms to use for the screening prevalence analysis. The fact that
the complete case and single imputation prevalence estimates were si-
milar to those from existing active case ascertainment studies that have
used these missing data strategies offers further support for the validity
of the screening algorithms. Furthermore, the screen positive pre-
valence of FASD remained relatively high (12.7%–12.8%) in sensitivity
analyses that applied two FASD screening algorithms with lower sen-
sitivity and higher specificity values to the data. Nevertheless, our va-
lidation sample was relatively small (N = 31) due to practical con-
straints and further algorithm validation studies are warranted.
Although ALSPAC benefits from repeated prospective measurement
of many prenatal exposures, a fundamental limitation of observational
studies of prenatal exposures is the risk of measurement bias due to the
use of self-report methods, in the absence of reliable biomarkers for
objective measurements (McQuire et al., 2016).
PAE data were collected between 1991 and 1992, when there were
no formal UK guidelines for drinking in pregnancy. Despite changes in

 guidance, patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption in ALSPAC are si-
milar to recently published estimates (Nykjaer et al., 2014; O'Keeffe
et al., 2015), suggesting that results may reflect present day patterns of
PAE and, therefore, FASD. Although, because FASD is determined by a
complex interplay of multiple factors that co-occur with maternal al-
cohol use, FASD prevalence could be subject to change based on the
relative prevalence of risk and protective factors.
Mothers in the ALSPAC sample were slightly more affluent and
children had higher levels of educational achievement than the general
population, which poses further limitations on the ability to generalise
findings from this sample to the general population of the UK (Boyd
et al., 2013; Fraser et al., 2013). Specifically, the estimates of FASD
prevalence in this sample may be lower than estimates derived from
samples with lower socioeconomic status and those that include chil-
dren with poorer educational outcomes on average.
5. Conclusions
FASD is potentially a common cause of developmental disability in
the UK that is under ascertained. Active case ascertainment studies of
FASD are urgently needed to clarify the current epidemiology of FASD
in the general population of the UK.
