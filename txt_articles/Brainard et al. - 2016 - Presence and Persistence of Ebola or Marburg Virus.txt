Abstract
Background
The 2013–15 Ebola outbreak was unprecedented due to sustained transmission within urban
environments and thousands of survivors. In 2014 the World Health Organization stated that
there was insufficient evidence to give definitive guidance about which body fluids are infec-
tious and when they pose a risk to humans. We report a rapid systematic review of published
evidence on the presence of filoviruses in body fluids of infected people and survivors.
Methods
Scientific articles were screened for information about filovirus in human body fluids. The
aim was to find primary data that suggested high likelihood of actively infectious filovirus in
human body fluids (viral RNA). Eligible infections were from Marburg virus (MARV or
RAVV) and Zaire, Sudan, Taï Forest and Bundibugyo species of Ebola. Cause of infection
had to be laboratory confirmed (in practice either tissue culture or RT-PCR tests), or evi-
denced by compatible clinical history with subsequent positivity for filovirus antibodies or
inflammatory factors. Data were extracted and summarized narratively.
Results
6831 unique articles were found, and after screening, 33 studies were eligible. For most
body fluid types there were insufficient patients to draw strong conclusions, and prevalence
of positivity was highly variable. Body fluids taken >16 days after onset were usually nega-
tive. In the six studies that used both assay methods RT-PCR tests for filovirus RNA gave
positive results about 4 times more often than tissue culture.
Conclusions
Filovirus was reported in most types of body fluid, but not in every sample from every other-
wise confirmed patient. Apart from semen, most non-blood, RT-PCR positive samples are
likely to be culture negative and so possibly of low infectious risk. Nevertheless, it is not
apparent how relatively infectious many body fluids are during or after illness, even when

with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the major risk for disease transmission
because of the known high viral loads in blood.
Author Summary
The 2013–15 Ebola outbreak has been much larger and lasted longer than any previous
Ebola emergence, and is further unusual because of the thousands of survivors left behind.
In 2014 the World Health Organization stated that lack of evidence made it impossible to
give confident guidance about which body fluids of Ebola patients or survivors are infec-
tious. This review summarises published evidence on presence of Ebola and the closely
related Marburg virus (filoviruses) in body fluids of infected people and survivors though
end July 2015. Scientific and other reports were searched for tests to detect filovirus in
human body fluids on otherwise confirmed cases. 33 reports had relevant test results.
Blood products were confirmed as likely to be highly infectious among actively ill cases. In
actively ill patients, filovirus was often found in non-blood body fluids. However, (apart
from in semen), it is rare for viable virus to be found in survivors. It is not apparent how
relatively infectious most body fluids are, due to inconsistencies in testing techniques and
lack of data about how much virus is present at different points of illness and recovery.
Introduction
The 2013–15 epidemic of Ebola virus disease in West Africa was the largest recorded filovirus
outbreak, as well as the first emergence of the Zaire species of Ebola in a high-density urban
setting. It is generally accepted that Ebola is a zoonotic infection whose primary reservoir is
probably bats [1]. Contact with wildlife generates a small number of index patients [1,2], and
widespread and sustained disease transmission can follow in community settings, with a subse-
quent high mortality rate [3].The size of the 2013–15 outbreak increased the need for better
understanding of all transmission pathways and specific types of exposure. Hence, much of the
previous advice and guidelines needs to be critically reviewed, particularly with regard to risks
within communities.
It is now generally accepted that both Ebola and the closely related Marburg virus diseases,
are typically transmitted through direct or indirect contact with body fluids of an infected indi-
vidual [4]. However uncertainties remain about which body fluids are infectious and when
they pose a risk [5]. In order to address these concerns the World Health Organization released
a set of “Q and As” on sanitation concerns during the 2013–15 outbreak [6], which also stated
that there was insufficient evidence to give definitive guidance. In order to undertake an ade-
quate risk assessment, knowledge on the presence of the virus in various body fluids is essential.
We report a rapid systematic review of the available published evidence on the presence of filo-
viruses in body fluids of infected people and survivors.

 Inclusion criteria
The aim was to find primary data that suggested high likelihood of actively infectious virus in
human body fluids (viral RNA). Eligible infections were from any of the Marburg virus species
and Zaire, Sudan, Taï Forest and Bundibugyo species of Ebola. Species of filovirus not known
to be dangerous to humans were excluded. Cause of infection had to be laboratory confirmed
(culture or polymerase chain reaction/RT-PCR tests), or evidenced by compatible clinical his-
tory with subsequent positivity for filovirus antibodies or inflammatory factors. Post-disease
markers in body fluids were not deemed eligible by themselves to confirm cause of disease,
because antibodies are widespread in the regional population, including in many people with
no relevant clinical history [7–11].
Commentaries, editorials, news reports, protocols or conference presentations were
excluded. We took it as given that any patient ill with filovirus should have detectable virus in
blood. Therefore, studies which only report a single test result on blood for each patient or did
not indicate the patient(s)’ day of illness were ineligible: they did not add to our objectives of
describing viral load change over time in blood, or the likelihood of virus in non-blood prod-
ucts. Similarly, articles which reported primary data that were duplicated elsewhere were not
included. Titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion criteria by a single reviewer and veri-
fied by a second reviewer. Where abstracts were unavailable, the paper was only assessed in full
text if the title included at least one of these keywords: survive, survival, fluids, viral load, urine,
semen, saliva, plasma or blood. Inclusion of full text papers was assessed in duplicate and deci-
sion differences at all stages were resolved by discussion. Articles were grouped where they
reported on the same primary data, to ensure patient results were not duplicated. We searched
selected papers for further articles relevant to our research questions.
Data were extracted from included studies by a single researcher and verified by a second
researcher, for patients with confirmed filovirus infection. Details extracted were: bibliographic
details, virus species, date and place of outbreak, body fluids tested, number of people tested
and number of samples, days following disease onset and assay methods.
A PRISMA checklist [12] is provided (S2 Table). Study validation (S3 Table) was primarily
concerned with reliable confirmation of disease cause and presence of eligible filovirus RNA.
Validity questions were intended to verify that assay methods were appropriate and validated,
that specimens were duplicate tested or compared to controls, and that samples were handled
and stored correctly for a relatively short period before testing (< 2 weeks, to reduce the risks
of specimen degradation).
Data on virus concentration in blood samples is presented in graphic form. Presence or
absence of virus in non-blood body fluids was presented as proportion positive with 95% confi-
dence intervals. In order to adjust for multiple samples from the same patient, each specimen
was weighted by the inverse of the number of samples from that patient: To prevent a large
number of test results from a small number of patients skewing the predicted probability of
positivity, each test result was weighted by the inverse of the number of samples from that
patient. Thus, if ten test results were from one patient, each carried a weight of 0.1, but if only
one test result existed for another patient, the latter test had a weight of 1 in constructing the
probability distribution. Proportions and associated confidence intervals (on a Poisson distri-
bution) were calculated using Stats Direct 3 and the results presented using fir tree diagrams,
for samples taken in the first 16 weeks after onset of illness only.
Results
4926 unique articles were found in Medline and Scopus (Fig 1), and 1905 items were found in
grey literature. 114 entries were immediately excluded for being conference abstracts,

 protocols, news reports, commentaries or editorials. A further 1603 items lacked an abstract.
Most of these appeared to be short commentaries, news summaries and possible conference
presentations; none contained keywords relevant to our review. Thus, 5114 references were
screened on title and abstract. Of these, 51 articles were chosen for full text review, of which
one came from the grey literature search (S1 Table). Six articles were cited by other literature
and also eligible for full text review. Twenty-six articles were excluded after full text review for
not meeting the eligibility criteria. This left 33 selected articles for which data were extracted
and summarised (Table 1). Detailed validity assessment is available (S3 Table).
The total number of patients who provided which types of samples in which time period
cannot be calculated precisely because of imprecise day-of-illness information reported in
some papers [13–15]. There is also the potential problem that some samples were provided by
the same patients in different articles (eg [16] and [17], or [18] and [19]). We corrected for this
where known and appropriate (to avoid duplicated data being reported twice), but there is a
small chance that a few patients were double-counted in our totals. Nevertheless, some over-
view comments about data availability can be made with confidence.
Apart from saliva and blood, there are potentially important gaps in the information on all
bodily fluids. There were too few samples to allow strong conclusions to be made for breastmilk,
vomit or sputum (fewer than 4 patients gave samples, with virus not detected in all, even during
active illness). There were no semen samples before day 32 of illness, and just 17 patients in total
provided all semen samples (positivity in first 7 months after disease onset = 70%). The patient
numbers for eye fluids, skin, sweat or vaginal swabs samples before day 17 of illness was just 4–9
individuals. In contrast, at least 14 patients provided samples for each of stools, urine, saliva or
blood products by the 16th day of illness. In the period through 112 days after onset of illness,
between 15 and 45 patients gave eye, skin, sweat and vaginal specimens Saliva and blood drew on
samples from 90+ unique patients of which at least 70 samples (50+ patients, saliva) and > 200
samples (145+ patients, blood) were collected before day 16. However, after day 16, blood sam-
ples were provided by just twelve of the uniquely identifiable 145 patients.
Body fluid data were found for Marburg (MARV) but not Ravn virus, and for Ebola species
EBOV and SUDV but not TAFV or BUDV. Presence of actively infectious virus in body fluids
was reported in six different ways. Precise viral load was not usually reported, and there were
problems with the consistency and accuracy of the assay tests used. Hence, virus presence in
blood is reported in our summary according to assay method (culture, RT-PCR or NAAT) and
units given by authors, but with many caveats, and in non-blood body fluids are mostly
reported as simply positive or negative.
Blood or blood products
Twenty-nine studies reported on filovirus detection in blood either in a time series for individ-
ual patients or for a group of five or more patients. 26 articles were concerned with Zaire Ebola,
two with Marburg virus [42] and one with SUDV Ebola [45]. Many reports [n = 14; 17,21–
23,27,30,31,33,35–37,40,42,44] merely reported presence or absence of viral RNA. Six papers
gave viral load/concentration in blood as CT values [19,24,28,32,34,39] and two articles [7,18]
stated tissue-culture infectious dose (TCID50). A 1978 paper reported infectious units [20] and
five studies gave results in copies per ml [15,25,26,38,45]. Plaque-forming units (PFU) were
also reported [14]. There was also a mix of detection methods (RT-PCR, culture and NAAT),
and some papers gave results for duplicated samples by two different assay methods with dif-
ferent units (eg., CT values by RT-PCR and presence/absence by culture [19]). Sometimes for
reporting purposes, authors converted their observed metrics (such as CT values) to another
reporting unit (eg., TCID50, [18]).

 Standardising these results to a single measurement unit was problematic. Multiplying
TCID50 by 0.7 for adults converts to PFU [46] and conversion curves from CT values to
TCID50 have been produced for Ebola virus [18], but translating a mere presence/absence test
to other units is less straightforward. Viral loads were often presented in imprecise graphic
forms [bar charts or scatterplots, 14,25,28,32,38,45]. Confidence intervals or ranges for viral
load estimates were provided (graphically) in only one paper [14]. As a result, most viral loads
were somewhat inexact, lacked confidence intervals and are not equivalent between patient
groups.
The blood measurements should still indicate when viral loads are probably highest and
when they are likely to approach undetection. Fig 2 shows viral load information in blood or
blood products from culture methods (left side panels) or RT-PCR (right side), in the units
reported by the stated authors, plotted against corresponding day of illness. The limit of
detection (LoD) is the bottom value on each chart, either stated or implicit in the reporting
methods. It merits mention that the true LoD for CT values (Panel d) may be uncertain.
Most authors follow a rule of � 40 cycles but it has been argued that for asymptomatic EBOV
convalescents, the true LoD may be � 36 cycles. [19] Presence/absence data in other articles
[17,21,23,27,30,31,33,35,37] are not shown in Fig 2 but can be used to observe that overall, only
7 of the 145 individually identified patients in our extracted data had detectable virus in blood
after day 16 of illness (using LoD � 40). The latest positivity was day 29 of illness, using the cri-
terion that CT value � 40. With a revised CT value detection threshold of 36, the latest date for
virus detected in blood among patients in our extracted data would be day 20 [18].
Other body fluids
Twenty two papers reported on the presence of filovirus in non-blood body fluids, three of
which concerned Marburg virus [41–43], one SUDV [13] and the remainder Zaire Ebola. The
proportions of positive samples are illustrated in Figs 3–6, grouped by testing method or date
(before day 113 after onset of illness). The numbers in parenthesis after each fluid type indicate
the number of patients who provided samples for each body fluid. The numbers on the right
side are the mean probability for positivity (also shown as a cross mark) with 95% confidence
interval in parentheses (shown as lines both sides of the cross).
We distinguish between results from culture (Fig 3) or by RT-PCR (Fig 4). RT-PCR results
are further divided into all early samples (Fig 5, <17 days after onset of illness) or all late sam-
ples (Fig 6, >16 days after onset of illness). Days 16/17 are an imperfectly identified typical
transition point from active illness to convalescence, because our included papers often did not
identify the last date of viraemia or active illness. We observe that blood samples are rarely

 positive on days 17–112 (Fig 2; virus was detected in blood of just 7 of 145 individuals who can
be individually identified in our extracted data). Most deaths from Ebola virus disease occur by
day 16 of illness [47,48]; the latest individually identified death in our dataset was on day 16 of
illness [23].
Overall, body fluid samples tested by RT-PCR (Fig 4) are about four times more likely to
test positive than those tested by culture (Fig 3). This approximate discrepancy also exists
among the six studies that provided duplicated results by both culture and RT-PCR
[13,16,17,25,30,40]. Results for saliva and other oral fluids are particularly in disagreement
(less than 5% positive by culture and almost 50% positive by RT-PCR). Virus was detected in
most breastmilk samples, but the dataset is too small (three samples from two patients) to be
conclusive. Data on seminal fluid are the most consistent between assay methods, with a mean
weighted probability of 21% positivity for culture before day 113, and 28% for RT-PCR. Virus
was detected in 73% of seminal fluid samples from 26 samples provided by 18 survivors before
day 113. The latest positive result (in seminal fluid) was 203 days after onset of illness, but no
results were available for days 111 to 202 or days 204 to 696 after onset of disease. Filovirus was
not detected in seminal fluid of six survivors at 697–707 days post-illness [16,17].
Probability of detection by RT-PCR in different body fluids is shown before day 17 (Fig 5)
and after day 16 (Fig 6). The small number of patients providing samples leads to large confi-
dence intervals for most body fluids. Saliva is unusual in being provided from over 50 patients

indicate the number of patients who provided samples for each body fluid. The numbers on the right side are the mean probability for positivity (also shown as
a cross mark) with 95% confidence interval in parentheses (shown as lines both sides of the cross).

 in both the early and late monitoring periods which leads to smaller confidence intervals. The
probability of virus detection in saliva was fairly similar in both periods, falling only modestly
from 55% to 45% before and after 16 days of illness.
Specific viral load data were usually not provided for non-blood samples. From the limited
available viral load data, it seems that viral loads can be high or may be almost negligible in
non-blood body fluids (high viral load is much more likely to be detected in blood). For
instance, very low viral loads were reported in urine (CT values = 36–40+) even when patients
had high viraemia [28,29]. For stools or rectal swabs from symptomatic patients, virus was not
detected in Kreuels et al [25] but viral load in stools was relatively high in two other patients
(maximum log 105–105.5 copies/ml: [26,38]). High viral loads for saliva were found in some
studies (on days 1–8, lowest CT value = 21, maximum log 105.5–106.3 copies/ml: [15,34,38]),
but virus was undetected in saliva of other patients on days 9–16 of illness [17,20,31,38].
Discussion
We report the first systematic review to investigate the probability of different body fluids
being positive for African filoviruses. We summarize evidence about presence and persistence
[49] of infectious virus in each body fluid compared to point of onset of illness, which is espe-
cially important information when managing disease transmission risks during a large

 outbreak where there may be many survivors. We provide quantitative estimates of the proba-
bility of positivity. Our main finding is that blood from infected patients is likely to be positive
for the virus but rarely later than 16 days after the onset of illness. Titres in blood can very
high,—up to about 108 viruses/ml; it seems that survival is related to the maximum virus titre
[45,50–53]. Many other body fluids are much less likely to be positive, particularly when tested
by tissue culture. Although viral loads can be high in some body fluids, virus may be completely
undetected, even during active illness. An exception is semen samples, which tended to consis-
tently test positive regardless of whether assay method was RT-PCR or culture.
Infected blood continues to appear to be the most infectious body fluid because it is the
body fluid that most consistently tests positive during illness, and viral loads are often observed
to be very high. High viral loads are less consistently reported in other bodily fluids. Disease
following contact with infected blood is well-documented [7,11,20,54]. Disease transmission
from contact with non-blood product body fluids has not been described as clearly, and may
depend to some extent on whether the fluid is contaminated with blood (visible or not). Given
the known propensity of patients to haemorrhage in later disease, contamination is a plausible
explanation. It is noteworthy that patients have been released from hospital when asymptom-
atic (especially without viraemia) in spite of detected virus in saliva, sweat or urine [25,38]
because it was not possible to cultivate virus swabbed from these areas in tissue culture. These
results may therefore indicate that recalibration of the limit of detection in at least some filovi-
rus RT-PCR tests in some contexts is advisable (as argued by Spengler et al [19]). It also merits

 mention that testing usually discontinues on individuals who have already had repeat negative
results. Therefore, what Figs 3–6 show is not the likelihood of positivity among all patients or
survivors, but rather among those cases for whom positivity is still suspected.
It is also not clear how RT-PCR positivity relates to infectiousness in the absence of a posi-
tive culture. Viral RNA can be detected for some time after virus is inactivated [55]. Six of our
included studies [13,16,17,25,30,40] suggest that perhaps only about 25% of RT-PCR filovirus-
positive samples are infectious.
Two case histories are relevant to human milk exposure, from mother-infant pairs [33].
Both infants were under six months old. Although one mother tested negative in blood and
breastmilk for Ebola virus disease (EVD), she was highly symptomatic and her urine tested
positive for viral RNA as did her baby (blood test) who subsequently died of EVD, having had
13 days of (not exclusive) breastfeeding during his mother’s active illness. A second breastfeed-
ing mother produced a positive test (blood) for Ebola and highly symptomatic, but her infant
(exclusively breastfed for first six days of mother’s illness) did not develop EVD. It is possible
that breastmilk alone from mothers with EVD poses low disease transmission risks to
unweaned babies. The immunological components in human milk are complex and can reduce
transmission of viral diseases from the mother [56]. The chances of EVD transmission from
breastmilk alone may be similar to the very low risks of HIV transmission to exclusively
breastfed babies [57], risks that rise sharply after the infant starts solids. However, a key

 difference between HIV and EVD transmission is that close physical contact with the ill mother
may mean exposure to other highly infectious bodily fluids from EVD, especially during the
most severe stages of illness. The authors of the mother-infant pair case histories highlighted
the possible inconsistencies and importance of multiple tests in clinical environments to con-
firm absence of filovirus infection.
World Health Organisation advice is now that male survivors should adopt barrier methods
during sexual contact for at least six months following end of illness [58]. Some accounts
[40,59] suggest that six months may still be inadequate; prospective studies [60,61] are under
way to gather better evidence about residual virus in seminal products. An epidemiological
account by Christie et al [39] describes disease transmission to just one of two sexual partners
of an EVD survivor; this suggests that viral load in semen may tend to be low or sporadic (low
virus load in semen of an EBOV survivor was also reported in Emond et al [20]).
One study [34] reported on viral shedding before illness and it seems likely that many body
fluids are infectious during at least late incubation. In several cases where virus shedding during
incubation was suspected [7,33,62] or shown [34], the incubating patient was either heavily
pregnant or in childbirth. It is suspected that immuno-suppression associated with pregnancy
can lead to delayed disease onset. Otherwise, data about possible disease transmission from
asymptomatic persons are inconclusive [9,16]. There is widespread filovirus antibody seroprev-
alence in central Africa (2–15% of the population) without history of relevant illness [7–11]
suggesting exposure mechanism(s) that can lead to infection without disease. The implications
of potentially widespread asymptomatic infection, or the mechanism that lead to it, are
unknown. Better understanding of the consequences of low dose exposure that presumably
leads to asymptomatic infection, might help to improve disease resistance or to identify opti-
mal intervention points when targeting resources during disease outbreaks. Infection without
disease is intriguing because it is widely believed that EVD can be caused by very minimal
exposure [63]. EVD resulted in non-human primates which were inoculated with as few as
four virions [64], and from aerosol exposure to PFU (log10) 2.6 concentrations of organisms
[65]. But it is unclear what the threshold for filovirus infectious dose is in actual community
outbreaks among humans [64,66].
Some of the most recent studies in our review discord with older research but also agree with
established guidance that was only weakly supported by older studies. For instance, although offi-
cial guidance has long stated [67] that filovirus was in sweat and any other body fluid, until
recently viral RNA was never reported in sweat [11], it still hasn’t been reported in vomit, and is
often not found in many other body fluids. Inconsistent test results between selected studies can
perhaps also be interpreted with respect to our assessment of validity and study quality. All
selected studies used appropriate and clearly described testing techniques, and nearly all used
confirmation strategies (multiple tests, different types of tests or laboratories on duplicate speci-
mens and/or healthy controls) to verify results. Most samples were tested relatively quickly
(within two weeks), although there was lack of clarity about the test timescale in some papers.
The only recurring concern about data collection is that many authors in African environments
reported challenges [13,16,17,23,45] in preserving specimen quality (especially preventing breaks
in the cold storage chain). These problems may have resulted in some unreliable results [33].
Within our review, virus in non-blood products was often detected by RT-PCR among patients
treated in high resource (western) hospital environments [19,25,26,29–31,40]. However, even
when RT-PCR suggested positivity, detection by culture in duplicated samples within this group
was repeatedly not possible, which was interpreted by clinicians and authors as a very low risk of
actual infectivity from these samples of non-blood body fluids [19,25,30]. New data emerging
from the most recent outbreaks should adhere to more rigorous storage and testing procedures
and thus further clarify the likelihood of infectious virus in specific body fluids.

 Limitations
It is very hard for any systematic review to be fully up-to-date so soon after a large outbreak.
Our search only covers research published on and before 23 July 2015. It is not desirable, how-
ever, to wait until all data from the 2014–2015 epidemic are available because the scientific
information may be needed soon to help manage the next outbreak.
There were biases in how body fluid data were collected. Surveys exist among convalescents
regardless of severity of original disease or possible sequelae [16,17], but many data collected
after day 16 were on patients who were not representative of most patients in a filovirus out-
break. Many samples after day 16 came from a small number of patients treated in high
resource (western) hospitals; these samples were more likely to have virus detected than sam-
ples from patients in Africa. It may be reasonable to assume samples collected in in an outbreak
area were less reliably stored or processed, and therefore more likely to incorrectly find no
virus detected. However, data were also more likely to be collected from patients still exhibiting
symptoms (treated at any location), especially viraemia, whereas all testing stopped on patients
who recovered quickly. Thus, test results tend to only be available for those who recently tested
positive. This bias in patient sample recruitment falsely elevates the apparent probability of late
positivity seen in our results. Further difficulties with the reliability of the detection tests
include the ever present possibility of false positives by any method, the contradictory results
reported from different test assay methods on identical samples (especially culture vs.
RT-PCR), or indeed the uncertainty about the appropriate threshold for correct CT values to
use when declaring Limit of Detection [19].
Conclusions
Filovirus has been found in most types of body fluid, but not every sample from every symp-
tomatic patient. Furthermore, with the exception of semen, most non-blood, RT-PCR positive
samples are likely to be culture negative and so of low infectious risk. Nevertheless, it is not
apparent how relatively infectious many body fluids are, even when culture positive, not least
because viral loads are uncertain. Contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains
the major risk for disease transmission.
