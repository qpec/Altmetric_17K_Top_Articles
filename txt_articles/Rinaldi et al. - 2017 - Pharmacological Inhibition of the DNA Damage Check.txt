ABSTRACT Ovarian function is directly correlated with survival of the primordial follicle reserve. Women diagnosed with cancer have a
primary imperative of treating the cancer, but since the resting oocytes are hypersensitive to the DNA-damaging modalities of certain
chemo- and radiotherapeutic regimens, such patients face the collateral outcome of premature loss of fertility and ovarian endocrine
function. Current options for fertility preservation primarily include the collection and cryopreservation of oocytes or in vitro-fertilized
oocytes, but this necessitates a delay in cancer treatment and additional assisted reproductive technology procedures. Here, we
evaluated the potential of pharmacological preservation of ovarian function by inhibiting a key element of the oocyte DNA damage
checkpoint response, checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2; CHEK2). Whereas nonlethal doses of ionizing radiation (IR) eradicate immature
oocytes in wild-type mice, irradiated Chk22/2 mice retain their oocytes and, thus, fertility. Using an ovarian culture system, we
show that transient administration of the CHK2 inhibitor 2-(4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenyl)-1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxamide-hydrate
(“CHK2iII”) blocked activation of the CHK2 targets TRP53 and TRP63 in response to sterilizing doses of IR, and preserved oocyte
viability. After transfer into sterilized host females, these ovaries proved functional and readily yielded normal offspring. These results
provide experimental evidence that chemical inhibition of CHK2 is a potentially effective treatment for preserving the fertility and
ovarian endocrine function of women exposed to DNA-damaging cancer therapies such as IR.

T is of paramount importance that organisms minimize the
transmission of deleterious mutations to their offspring.
Accordingly, sensitive mechanisms have evolved to eliminate
germ cells that have sustained certain threshold amounts of
DNA damage (Heyer et al. 2000; Suh et al. 2006; Bolcun-Filas
et al. 2014; Pacheco et al. 2015). Under normal circum-
stances, this is desirable. However, because women are born
with a finite number of oocytes, environmental factors that
cause DNA damage to oocytes can result in primary ovarian
insufficiency (POI), sterility, and ovarian failure. This is a
crucial issue for cancer patients undergoing certain types of
chemotherapy or radiation therapy (Woodruff 2007). For
example, POI occurs in nearly 40% of all female breast cancer
survivors (Oktay et al. 2006). The resulting premature ovar-
ian failure has a major impact on women’s’ lives, both phys-
iologically and emotionally. As the life expectancy of cancer
survivors increases, so does the need to address the adverse
outcomes to fertility. Therefore, the ability to inhibit oocyte
death and preserve fertility, in both prepubertal cancer pa-
tients and premenopausal women, would have a major im-
pact on survivors’ lives.
At present, cancer patients have few options regarding
fertility preservation (“oncofertility”) before treatment, and
most involve invasive surgical procedures such as extraction
of oocytes or ovarian tissue for cryopreservation, or in vitro
fertilization followed by embryo cryopreservation (Redig
et al. 2011; Salama and Mallmann 2015; Kim et al. 2016).
Not only are these procedures invasive, but also they neces-
sitate a delay in cancer treatment. An alternative is to coad-
minister drugs that protect oocytes from chemotherapy at the
time of treatment. Based upon the knowledge that activation
of the “TA” isoform of the DNA damage checkpoint gene
Trp63 (TP63 in humans, also known as p63; the TA isoform
of the protein will be referred to as TAp63) occurs via

 phosphorylation, the use of kinase inhibitors was suggested as
a means to prevent radiation-induced oocyte loss in mice (Suh
et al. 2006). It was reported (Gonfloni et al. 2009), but later
challenged (Kerr et al. 2012) and counter argued (Maiani et al.
2012), that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (Gleevec) is
effective in protecting oocytes. Even if imatinib proves to have
such activity, it is a relatively promiscuous kinase inhibitor that
blocks, among other targets, the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT
that functions in germline stem cells (Lee and Wang 2009).
We previously reported that mouse checkpoint kinase
2 (CHK2) is a key component of the meiotic DNA damage
checkpoint, and that deletion of Chk2 prevented irradiation-
induced killing of postnatal oocytes (Bolcun-Filas et al.
2014). We also showed that the CHK2 kinase phosphorylates
both p53 (formally TRP53; TP53 in humans) and TAp63 in
oocytes to activate these proteins (and stabilize p53). There-
fore, the deletion of Chk2 effectively impairs the activation of
these two downstream effectors, which are both needed to
trigger efficient oocyte elimination (Bolcun-Filas et al. 2014).
More importantly, damaged oocytes that survived in the
absence of CHK2 produced healthy pups, suggesting that
the inflicted DNA damage was repaired (Bolcun-Filas et al.
2014). The resistance of Chk22/2 oocytes to otherwise lethal
levels of ionizing radiation (IR) prompted us to explore
whether chemical inhibition of CHK2 would be effective at
preventing radiation-induced oocyte death, and thus consti-
tute a potential option for preserving ovarian function in
women undergoing cancer therapy. Here, we show that tran-
sient chemical inhibition of CHK2 suppresses follicle loss and
allows for the production of healthy offspring.
Materials and Methods
Mice
Mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, strains
C3HeB/FeJ, stock # 000658[(agouti mice, homozygous dom-
inant for coat color (A/A)] and C3FeLe.B6-a/J, stock #
000198 [black mice, recessive for coat color, (a/a)]. Cornell’s
Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal usage,
under protocol 2004-0038 awarded to J. C. Schimenti.
Organ culture
Ovaries were cultured using an adaptation of a published
method (Livera et al. 2008). Briefly, ovaries were collected
from 5-day postpartum (dpp) C3FeLe.B6-a/J mice and, fol-
lowing removal from the bursa, placed into cell culture in-
serts (Millicell; pore size, 8 mm; diameter, 12 mm) presoaked
in ovary culture media (minimal essential media supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES pH =
7.0, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 mg/ml
Fungizone, 1% DMSO, and CHK2 inhibitor). The inserts were
placed into 24-well plates (Model MD24; Thermo Fisher)
with carriers for the inserts. Sufficient media was added to
keep organs moist, but not completely submerged. Organs
were incubated at 37�, 5% CO2, and atmospheric O2.
Drug treatment
2-(4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenyl)-1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxamide-
hydrate (designated “Chk2 inhibitor II” by the manufacturer,
referred to hereafter as CHK2iII) (220486; Calbiochem, San
Diego, CA; La Jolla, CA) was prepared as 1 and 2 mM stock
solutions in DMSO and kept frozen at 220�. Media containing
the desired concentration of inhibitor was prepared shortly be-
fore use, assuring that the DMSO concentration was constant
(1% DMSO) throughout the different conditions. Explanted
ovaries were preincubated for 2 hr in warm (37�) media con-
taining the desired concentration of inhibitor or 1% DMSO
alone before being subjected to IR in a 137Cs irradiator with a
rotating turntable. Figure 2A presents the media change regi-
men, with the first replacement being immediately after irradi-
ation. The ovaries were cultured for either 3 hr before being
processed for western blot analysis (to detect DNA damage
responses), or 7 days followed by either fixation and immunos-
taining (to quantify oocyte survival) or ovary transplant surgery
into sterile agouti females.
Western blot analyses and antibodies
Ovary protein lysates, immunoblotting, probing, and detec-
tion were conducted as described (Bolcun-Filas et al. 2014).
Primary antibodies and dilutions used were: mouse anti-p63
(1:500, 4A4; Novus Biologicals); rabbit anti-p53 (1:300,
#9282; Cell Signaling); mouse anti-b-actin (1:5000; Sigma
[Sigma Chemical], St Louis, MO) and rabbit anti-MVH (Mouse
Vasa homolog) (1:1000; Abcam). Secondary antibodies used
were: Immuno Pure goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) peroxidase
conjugate (1:5000; Thermo Fisher) and goat anti-rabbit IgG
HRP (Horseradish peroxidase)-linked antibody (1:5000; Cell
Signaling).
Immunofluorescence
Cultured ovaries were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/
PBS at 4� overnight (ON), and then washed and stored in
70% ethanol. Ovaries were either embedded in paraffin
and sectioned at 5 mm for immunostaining or subjected to
whole-mount immunostaining and clearing. For the stan-
dard immunofluorescence, slides were deparaffinized and
rehydrated prior to antigen retrieval using sodium citrate
buffer. Slides were blocked with 5% goat serum (PBS/
Tween 20), incubated at 4� ON with the aforementioned
primary antibodies (anti-p63 at 1:500 dilution and anti-
MVH 1:1000), and subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor
secondary antibodies for 1 hr and Hoechst dye for 5 min.
Slides were mounted with ProLong Antifade (Thermo
Fisher) and imaged.
Ovary transfer surgery and postmortems
Agouti females were sterilized with 0.5 Gy of IR at 1 week of
age. At 8 weeks of age, females were housed with males
known to be fertile. Eight weeks later, and 2 days prior to
ovary transfer surgery, the males were removed. Three ova-
ries, either treated or not with CHK2iII, were placed in the
intrabursal space of each ovary (a total of six ovaries per

V. D. Rinaldi et al.
 recipientfemale).Thefemaleswereallowedarecoveryperiod
of 6 weeks, then housed with males. Three to four months
later, upon euthanasia, dissection was performed for visual
inspection of the transplantation sites.
Whole-organ immunofluorescence
Ovaries cultured for 7 days were fixed in freshly prepared 4%
PFA/PBS at 4� ON. Afterward, tissues were washed and
stored in 70% ethanol at 4� until further processing.
Fixed ovaries were washed and left to equilibrate for
a minimum of 4 hr in PBS before initializing the whole-mount
immunostaining protocol. To facilitate handling and tissue
integrity, ovaries were kept in the culture insert throughout
the whole procedure. The ovaries were treated for 4 hr
in permeabilization solution [PBS, 0.2% polyvynal alcohol
(PVA), 0.1% NaBH4-solution (Sigma), and 1.5% Triton
X-100], then incubated for 24 hr in blocking solution (PBS,
0.1% Triton X-100, 0.15% glycine pH 7.4, 10% normal goat
serum, 3% BSA, 0.2% sodium azide, 100 units/ml penicillin,
100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 mg/ml Fungizone). All the
immunostaining and clearing was performed at room tem-
perature with gentle rocking. Antibodies were diluted to ap-
propriate concentrations in the blocking solution. Primary
antibodies [mouse anti-p63 (1:500, 4A4; Novus Biologicals)
and rabbit anti-MVH (1:600; Abcam)] were incubated for
4 days. Afterward, ovaries were incubated with washing so-
lution (PBS, 0.2% PVA, and 0.15% Triton X-100) for 10 hr
then two times for 2 hr each. Secondary antibodies (1:1000
Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies) were incubated for 3 days
in vials protected from light. Ovaries were washed with
washing solution for three times of 12 hr (if needed, DAPI
50 ng/ml was added to the first wash).
Clearing, imaging, and oocyte quantification
Immunostained ovaries were cleared with modified, freshly-
prepared ScaleS4(0) reagent [40% D-(-)-sorbitol (w/v), 10%
glycerol, 4 M urea, and 20% DMSO, pH 8.1 (Hama et al.
2015), gently mixed by inversion at 50� for 30 min, and
degassed prior to use]. Solution was refreshed twice daily
until tissue became transparent (usually 2 days). The insert
was placed on top of a glass slide, and the membrane con-
taining the cultured ovaries was carefully removed with a
fine tip scalpel and placed on the slide. Slides were imaged
on an upright laser-scanning Zeiss LSM880 (Zeiss [Carl
Zeiss], Thornwood, CA) confocal/multiphoton microscope,
using a 10 3 NA 0.45 water immersion objective. For proper
image stitching, the adjacent images (tiles) were overlapped
by 20%. The z-steps were set for 5 mm between optical sec-
tions. Images were reconstructed, visualized, and analyzed
using Fiji-ImageJ (Schindelin et al. 2012).
Movies were made using the 3D project feature of Fiji-
ImageJ (Schindelin et al. 2012). Oocyte quantification was
performed in flattened maximum intensity projections of the
Z-stacks image series, using the “analyze particle” feature of
Fiji-ImageJ.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were done using JMP Pro12 software
(version 12.0.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Fertility was ana-
lyzed using a mixed model with mother as random effect and
ovary treatment as fixed effect. Least square (LS) means
difference between litter sizes derived from treated vs. non-
treated ovaries was performed using the Student’s t-test. LS
mean differences between follicle counts from the different
treatment groups were tested using Tukey’s honest signifi-
cant difference (HSD).

Results and Discussion
Irradiation of ovaries induces CHK2-dependent phosphoryla-
tion of TAp63 in oocytes, and this phosphorylation is essential
for triggering their death (Suh et al. 2006; Bolcun-Filas et al.
2014). CHK2 is a key component of the DNA damage re-
sponse pathway that responds primarily to DNA double-
strand breaks (DSBs), lying downstream of the apical kinase
ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated). Members of the ATM .
CHK2 . p53/p63 pathway have been implicated as potential
anticancer drug targets sensitizing cancer cells to genotoxic
therapies, and chemical inhibitors have been developed
against CHK2 (Garrett and Collins 2011), which, when de-
leted in mice, causes only minor phenotypic consequences

of CHK2 inhibitor II (see Materials and Methods), and exposed or not to
3 Gy of g-radiation. The immunoblot membrane was cut into two parts,
one containing proteins . 60 kDa and the other , 60 kDa, and probed
with anti-p63 and anti-p53, respectively. The . 60 kDa portion was
stripped and reprobed for the germ cell marker MVH. Arrowheads in-
dicated the expected molecular weight of the phosphorylated form of

CHK2 Inhibition Protects Irradiated Oocytes

 (Takai et al. 2002). Therefore, we tested whether a well-
characterized and highly specific (Arienti et al. 2005; Garrett
and Collins 2011) CHK2 inhibitor (CHK2iII) could mimic the
oocyte-protective effect of genetic Chk2 deletion, and if it
could do so in a nontoxic manner.
We employed an organ culture paradigm to control con-
centrations, penetration, and timing of drug delivery to the
ovary. Using dose ranges based upon published data (Arienti
et al. 2005) and the manufacturer’s recommendations, we
first tested the ability of CHK2iII to block phosphorylation
of TAp63 in irradiated ovaries, and to block the stabilization
of p53, which is normally rapidly degraded in cells unless
stabilized by DNA-damage-induced phosphorylation by pro-
teins including CHK2 (Chehab et al. 2000; Hirao et al. 2000).
We used ovaries from 5-dpp females to ensure that oocytes
were in the dictyate arrest stage of meiosis, residing within
primordial follicles. Explanted ovaries were cultured for 2 hr
in the presence of 0, 10, or 20 mM CHK2iII, then subjected (or
not) to 3 Gy of IR, a level that not only kills oocytes, but also
causes extensive p53 stabilization and TAp63 phosphoryla-
tion (Suh et al. 2006; Bolcun-Filas et al. 2014). Ovaries were
harvested 3 hr later for protein extraction and western blot
analysis. In nonirradiated ovaries, TAp63 remained unphos-
phorylated and p53 was undetectable (Figure 1). Irradiation
in the absence of inhibitor led to robust p53 stabilization, and
all TAp63 was shifted to a higher mobility, which is known to
be due to phosphorylation (Suh et al. 2006; Livera et al.
2008). Addition of 10 and 20 mM CHK2iII led to partial
and complete inhibition of TAp63 phosphorylation, respec-
tively, and also progressively decreased p53 levels (Figure 1).
This confirms that CHK2iII treatment rapidly acts to prevent
the activation of two proapoptotic factors in the ovary.
Next, we tested whether CHK2iII could permanently pro-
tect oocytes from a lower dose of radiation (0.4 Gy) that
normally kills all oocytes within 2 days (Bolcun-Filas et al.
2014) but is far below levels (. 5 Gy) that are lethal to whole
animals. Ovaries were cultured in media supplemented with
0, 5, 10, or 20 mM of inhibitor for 2 hr before irradiation.
Following IR exposure, ovaries were cultured for two more
days with media changes as delineated in Figure 2A, after
which the drug was removed from the medium. This protocol
of media changes with drug replenishment was optimized for

 oocyte survival. Seven days after irradiation (and 5 days
after removal of CHK2iII), oocyte survival was assessed by
co-immunolabeling of histological sections (Supplemental
Material, Figure S1) and of whole mounts, with the cytoplas-
mic germ cell marker MVH and oocyte nuclear marker p63
(Figure 2B, Figure S2A, Movie M1 in File S1, Movie M2 in File
S2, and Movie M3 in File S3). Under these conditions, the
inhibitor was well tolerated and oocyte survival in unirradi-
ated ovaries was not compromised (Figure S2B, Movie M4 in
File S4, and Movie M5 in File S5).
Remarkably, though 10 mM CHK2iII only partially inhibited
TAp63 phosphorylation induced by 3 Gy of IR (Figure 1), it
dramatically improved oocyte survival in ovaries exposed to
0.4 Gy of IR, a level sufficient to trigger TAp63 phosphoryla-
tion and eliminate nearly all primordial follicles in ovaries
(Figure 2, B and C and Figure S3) (Bolcun-Filas et al. 2014).
A small but significant protective effect was also observed with
5 mM CHK2iII (P = 0.004, Figure 2, B and C).
To assess if oocytes protected by CHK2iII from otherwise
lethal levels of irradiation were capable of ovulation, fertil-
ization, and subsequent embryonic development, we per-
formed intrabursal transfers of irradiated ovaries (0.4 Gy)
into histocompatible (strain C3H) agouti females. These re-
cipient females were first sterilized at 7 dpp by exposure to
0.5 Gy of IR. Once females were 8 weeks old, sterility was
verifiedbyhousingthemwithfertilemalesforatleast8weeks.
The IR-induced oocyte death led to premature ovarian fail-
ure, yielding sufficient intrabursal space without the need to
physically remove the vestigial ovaries before ovary transfer.
These recipients were 16 weeks of age at the time of surgery.
Three cultured ovaries, derived from black female animals
also of strain C3H (see Materials and Methods for additional
information), were placed into each bursa (total six ovaries
per animal). Figure 3A summarizes the experimental time-
line. A total of eight successful embryo transfer surgeries
were completed. Three females received mock-treated (cul-
tured in media containing 1% DMSO alone), irradiated ova-
ries (0.4 Gy), and five females received irradiated ovaries
(also 0.4 Gy) treated with 10 mM CHK2iII in media contain-
ing 1% DMSO.
Once the transferred donor ovary reached 8 weeks of age
(with respect to the time at which it was explanted), the
recipient females were mated to proven fertile C3H black (a/a)
males for 3 months, and monitored for litters and the coat
colors of offspring. Only females that received CHK2iII-treat-
ed ovaries delivered progeny, all of which were black, con-
firming that they were produced from fertilization of oocytes
ovulated from donor ovaries (Figure 3, B and C). All offspring
had no visible abnormalities that would suggest the inheri-
tance of gross chromosomal abnormalities (Bolcun-Filas et al.
2014). The viability of these animals indicated that even
though oocytes have sensitive checkpoint mechanisms ren-
dering them vulnerable to low levels of DNA damage, they
are capable of repairing damaged DNA in a manner com-
patible with normal embryogenesis. Consistent with the
IR-induced oocyte death in ovaries not treated with CHK2iII,
Figure 3 CHK2iII-rescued ovaries are fertile. (A) Experi-
mental timeline. Agouti females (A/A) were sterilized with
0.5 Gy of IR at 1 week of age. The transplanted ovaries
were from black donor females (a/a) treated as outlined in
Figure 2A. (B) Agouti host females gave birth to black
offspring (a/a) exclusively; thus, the ovulated eggs pro-
duced were from the donor ovaries. (C) Litter sizes of

CHK2 Inhibition Protects Irradiated Oocytes
1827
 and also the absence of progeny from females receiving such
ovaries, postmortem inspection revealed only residual ova-
ries in these recipients compared to those mice that received
the CHK2iII-treated ovaries (Figure S4).
Our results provide proof-in-principle for the strategy of
targeting the CHK2-dependent DNA damage checkpoint path-
way for preventing loss of the ovarian reserve, and thus
ovarian failure, in cancer patients undergoing therapies that
are toxic to oocytes. Importantly, checkpoint inhibitors have
already been explored as potential anticancer therapies, thus
substantial information is already available on members of
this drug class (Antoni et al. 2007; Garrett and Collins 2011).
Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether systemic admin-
istration of CHK2iII or other CHK2 inhibitors can achieve
similar oocyte-protective efficacy against IR- or drug-induced
DSBs in vivo, and whether they will be effective for both pre-
pubertal and adult females. Additionally, it will be important
to conduct more thorough studies of potential genetic risks
associated with oocytes rescued from DNA damage-induced
death by checkpoint inhibition.
