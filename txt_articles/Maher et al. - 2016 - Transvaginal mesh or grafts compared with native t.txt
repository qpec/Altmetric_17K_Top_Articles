Background
A wide variety of grafts have been introduced with the aim of improving the outcomes of traditional native tissue repair (colporrhaphy)
for vaginal prolapse.
Objectives
To determine the safety and effectiveness of transvaginal mesh or biological grafts compared to native tissue repair for vaginal prolapse.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, ongoing trials registers, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (6
July 2015). We also contacted researchers in the field.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different types of vaginal repair (mesh, biological graft, or native tissue).
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. The primary outcomes were awareness of
prolapse, repeat surgery, and recurrent prolapse on examination.
Main results
We included 37 RCTs (4023 women). The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were poor
reporting of study methods, inconsistency, and imprecision.

 Awareness of prolapse at one to three years was less likely after mesh repair (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to
0.81, 12 RCTs, n = 1614, I2 = 3%, moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that if 19% of women are aware of prolapse after native
tissue repair, between 10% and 15% will be aware of prolapse after permanent mesh repair.
Rates of repeat surgery for prolapse were lower in the mesh group (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.88, 12 RCTs, n = 1675, I2 = 0%,
moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of repeat surgery for continence (RR
1.07, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.83, 9 RCTs, n = 1284, I2 = 21%, low-quality evidence). More women in the mesh group required repeat
surgery for the combined outcome of prolapse, stress incontinence, or mesh exposure (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.81, 7 RCTs, n =
867, I2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that if 5% of women require repeat surgery after native tissue repair, between
7% and 18% in the permanent mesh group will do so. Eight per cent of women in the mesh group required repeat surgery for mesh
exposure.
Recurrent prolapse on examination was less likely after mesh repair (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.53, 21 RCTs, n = 2494, I2 = 73%,
low-quality evidence). This suggests that if 38% of women have recurrent prolapse after native tissue repair, between 11% and 20%
will do so after mesh repair.
Permanent mesh was associated with higher rates of de novo stress incontinence (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.82, 12 RCTs, 1512
women, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence) and bladder injury (RR 3.92, 95% CI 1.62 to 9.50, 11 RCTs, n = 1514, I2 = 0%, moderate-
quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates of de novo dyspareunia (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.58 to
1.47, 11 RCTs, n = 764, I2 = 21%, low-quality evidence). Effects on quality of life were uncertain due to the very low-quality evidence.
Absorbable mesh versus native tissue repair
There was very low-quality evidence for the effectiveness of either form of repair at two years on the rate of awareness of prolapse (RR
1.05, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.44, 1 RCT, n = 54).
There was very low-quality evidence for the effectiveness of either form of repair on the rate of repeat surgery for prolapse (RR 0.47,
95% CI 0.09 to 2.40, 1 RCT, n = 66).
Recurrent prolapse on examination was less likely in the mesh group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96, 3 RCTs, n = 292, I2 = 21%, low-
quality evidence)
The effect of either form of repair was uncertain for urinary outcomes, dyspareunia, and quality of life.
Biological graft versus native tissue repair
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups at one to three years for the outcome awareness of prolapse (RR 0.97, 95%
CI 0.65 to 1.43, 7 RCTs, n = 777, low-quality evidence).
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups for the outcome repeat surgery for prolapse (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.44,
5 RCTs, n = 306, I2 = 8%, low-quality evidence).
The effect of either approach was very uncertain for recurrent prolapse (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.47, 7 RCTs, n = 587, I2 = 59%,
very low-quality evidence).
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups for dyspareunia or quality of life outcomes (very low-quality evidence).
Authors’ conclusions
While transvaginal permanent mesh is associated with lower rates of awareness of prolapse, repeat surgery for prolapse, and prolapse on
examination than native tissue repair, it is also associated with higher rates of repeat surgery for prolapse or stress urinary incontinence
or mesh exposure (as a composite outcome), and with higher rates of bladder injury at surgery and de novo stress urinary incontinence.
The risk-benefit profile means that transvaginal mesh has limited utility in primary surgery. While it is possible that in women with
higher risk of recurrence the benefits may outweigh the risks, there is currently no evidence to support this position.
Limited evidence suggests that absorbable mesh may reduce rates of recurrent prolapse on examination compared to native tissue repair,
but there was insufficient evidence on absorbable mesh for us to draw any conclusions for other outcomes. There was also insufficient
evidence for us to draw any conclusions regarding biological grafts compared to native tissue repair.
In 2011, many transvaginal permanent meshes were voluntarily withdrawn from the market, and the newer, lightweight transvaginal
permanent meshes still available have not been evaluated within a RCT. In the meantime, these newer transvaginal meshes should be
utilised under the discretion of the ethics committee.

Transvaginal mesh or grafts compared with native tissue repair for vaginal prolapse
Review question
Should transvaginal mesh or biological grafts or native tissue be utilised to repair vaginal prolapse?
Background
Pelvic organ prolapse is common, affecting as many as 50% of women who have had children. The traditional method of repairing
vaginal prolapse using native tissue is associated with high rates of recurrence. It is thought that transvaginal grafts made of absorbable
or permanent mesh or biological material may improve the outcomes of prolapse surgery.
Study characteristics
We evaluated 37 randomised controlled trials (4023 women) comparing transvaginal grafts versus traditional native tissue repair for
repairing vaginal prolapse. The evidence is current to July 2015.
Key results
Low to moderate quality evidence suggests that there are advantages to using transvaginal permanent mesh compared to native tissue
repair, including lower rates of awareness of prolapse, repeat surgery for prolapse, and recurrent prolapse on examination. The evidence
suggests that if 19% of women are aware of prolapse after native tissue repair, between 10% and 15% will be aware of prolapse after
permanent mesh repair. If the rate of recurrent prolapse on examination after a native tissue repair is assumed to be 38%, the risk
would be between 11% and 20% after a repair with transvaginal permanent mesh. However, there are also problems associated with
permanent transvaginal mesh. If we assume that 5% of women require repeat surgery for prolapse or urinary incontinence or mesh
exposure (any of the three) after native tissue repair, the risk would be between 7% and 18% after permanent mesh repair. Eight per
cent of women in the mesh groups required repeat surgery for mesh exposure.
Low quality evidence suggests that absorbable mesh may reduce the risk of recurrent prolapse on examination compared to native tissue
repair, but there is insufficient evidence on absorbable mesh for us to draw any conclusions for other outcomes.
Low quality evidence suggests there is no difference between biological grafts and native tissue repair on rates of awareness of prolapse
or reoperation for prolapse. Due to the very low quality of evidence, the impact of the interventions on prolapse on examination was
uncertain.
While permanent mesh has some advantages over native tissue, there are also disadvantages in its routine use. Many transvaginal
permanent meshes were withdrawn from use in 2011, and the newer, lightweight transvaginal permanent meshes still available have
not been evaluated within a randomised study.
Quality of the evidence
Overall, the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were poor reporting of study methods,
inconsistency, and imprecision.

Description of the condition
Pelvic organ prolapse is common and is seen on examination in
40% to 60% of parous women (Handa 2004; Hendrix 2002).
The annual aggregated rate of associated surgery in the USA is in
the range of 10 to 30 per 10,000 women (Brubaker 2002). Pelvic
organ prolapse is the descent of one or more of the pelvic organs
(uterus, vagina, bladder, or bowel). The different types of prolapse
include:
• upper vaginal prolapse (apical prolapse), i.e. uterus, vaginal
vault (after hysterectomy when the top of the vagina drops
down);
• anterior vaginal wall prolapse, i.e. cystocele (bladder
descends), urethrocele (urethra descends), paravaginal defect
(pelvic fascia defect);
• posterior vaginal wall prolapse, i.e. enterocele (small bowel
descends), rectocele (rectum descends), perineal deficiency.
A woman can present with prolapse of one or more of these sites.
The aetiology of pelvic organ prolapse is complex and multi-facto-
rial. Possible risk factors include pregnancy, childbirth, congenital
or acquired connective tissue abnormalities, denervation or weak-
ness of the pelvic floor, ageing, hysterectomy, menopause, and fac-
tors associated with chronically raised intra-abdominal pressure
(Bump 1998; Gill 1998; MacLennan 2000).
Women with prolapse commonly have a variety of pelvic floor
symptoms, only some of which are directly related to the prolapse.
Generalised symptoms of prolapse include pelvic heaviness; bulge,
lump or protrusion coming down from the vagina; a dragging sen-
sation in the vagina; or backache. Symptoms of bladder, bowel,
or sexual dysfunction are frequently present. For example, women
may need to reduce the prolapse digitally to aid urinary voiding
or defecation. These symptoms may be directly related to the pro-
lapsed organ, for example poor urinary stream when a cystocele is
present or obstructed defecation in case of a rectocele. They may
also be independent of the prolapse, for example symptoms of
overactive bladder when a cystocele is present, or irritable bowel
when a rectocele is present.
Description of the intervention
Treatment of prolapse depends on the severity of the prolapse, its
symptoms, the woman’s general health, and surgeon preference
and capabilities. Options available for treatment are conservative,
mechanical, or surgical interventions.
Generally, conservative or mechanical treatments are considered
for women with a mild degree of prolapse, those who wish to have
more children, the frail, or those women unwilling to undergo
surgery. Separate Cochrane reviews have considered conservative
and mechanical interventions (Adams 2004; Hagen 2011). There
was no good evidence to guide management in either of these
reviews.
A wide variety of abdominal and vaginal surgical techniques are
available for the treatment of prolapse (see Appendix 1). The most
common procedures are anterior repair (colporrhaphy) for ante-
rior vaginal wall prolapse and posterior repair (colporrhaphy) for
posterior vaginal wall prolapse. Together, anterior and posterior
compartment surgery account for the majority of all prolapse op-
erations Haya 2015 . Two main approaches can be used.
• Vaginal approaches include vaginal hysterectomy, anterior
or posterior vaginal wall repair (colporrhaphy), McCall
culdoplasty, Manchester repair (amputation of the cervix with
uterus suspension to the cardinal ligaments), prespinous and
sacrospinous colpopexy, enterocele ligation, paravaginal repair,
Le Fort’s procedure, and perineal reconstruction.
• Abdominal approaches include hysterectomy, sacral
colpopexy, paravaginal repair, vault suspending and uterosacral
ligament plication, enterocele ligation, and posterior vaginal wall
repair. Abdominal surgery can be performed through an open
incision or keyhole incisions via the laparoscope or robot.
A combination of these procedures may be employed in the sur-
gical correction of prolapse, as frequently more than one type of
prolapse may occur.
In addition to the variety of prolapse operations, the surgeon must
choose whether to use absorbable sutures such as polyglycolic acid-
based materials (for example polyglactin), delayed-absorption su-
tures such as polydioxanone, or non-absorbable sutures such as
polypropylene. Furthermore, over the last decade in an effort to re-
duce the recurrence rate of prolapse and given the success of mesh
used in continence surgery, at sacral colpopexy, and at abdominal
hernias, surgeons have utilised grafts at transvaginal repairs.
Graft material can be synthetic (for example permanent
polypropylene or absorbable polyglactin mesh) or biological. Bio-
logical grafts can be further divided into autologous (using a per-
son’s own tissue, such as fascial sheath), alloplastic (from animals,
for example porcine dermis), or homologous (for example cadav-
eric fascia lata).
The choice of operation depends on a number of factors, which
include the nature, site, and severity of the prolapse; whether there
are additional symptoms affecting urinary, bowel, or sexual func-
tion; the general health of the woman; and surgeon preference and
capability. Concomitant procedures to treat or prevent urinary in-
continence are often performed.
To aid the assessment of the success of surgery, clear pre- and post-
operative site-specific vaginal grading and details of the operative
intervention should be recorded in the reports.
How the intervention might work
The aims of surgery include:
• the restoration of normal vaginal anatomy;
6

 • the restoration or maintenance of normal bladder function;
• the restoration or maintenance of normal bowel function;
• the restoration or maintenance of normal sexual function.
The restoration of normal anatomy is achieved by utilising grafts
as an alternative to the native tissue repair. The graft is utilised
to prevent the descent of the bladder into the vagina, the bowel
moving forward into the vagina, or the uterus or upper vagina
descending towards or beyond the vaginal opening.
Why it is important to do this review
The wide variety of surgical treatments available for prolapse indi-
cates the lack of consensus as to the optimal treatment. No clinical
guidelines exist to identify the preferred surgical intervention. The
most reliable evidence is likely to come from the consideration of
randomised controlled trials, and this is the basis for our review.
The aim is to help identify optimal practice and to highlight where
there is a need for further research.
This review should be read as part of a series of six Cochrane
reviews relating to the surgical management of prolapse including:
1. Surgery for women with anterior compartment prolapse.
2. Surgery for women with posterior compartment prolapse.
3. Surgery for women with apical compartment prolapse.
4. Continence outcomes in pelvic organ prolapse surgery.
5. Transvaginal grafts or mesh compared with native tissue
repair for vaginal prolapse (current review).
6. Peri-operative interventions at prolapse surgery.
This review evaluating any transvaginal grafts as compared to na-
tive tissue repairs was not reported separately in the Cochrane
surgery for pelvic organ prolapse 2013 review, and thus represents
a new evaluation. We have included 13 new trials, Dahlgren 2011,
da Silveira 2014, Delroy 2013, De Tayrac 2013, Gupta 2014,
Lamblin 2014, Qatawneh 2013, Robert 2014, Rudnicki 2014,
Sung 2012, Svabik 2014, Tamanini 2014, and Turgal 2013, and
a three-year update of Iglesia 2010 since the last review.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
We required that studies include at least 20 participants in each
arm.
Types of participants
Adult women seeking treatment for symptomatic pelvic organ
prolapse (either primary or recurrent).
Pelvic organ prolapse includes:
• anterior vaginal wall prolapse (cystocele, urethrocele,
paravaginal defect);
• upper vaginal prolapse (apical prolapse), i.e. prolapse of the
uterine or vaginal vault in those who have undergone a
hysterectomy;
• posterior vaginal wall prolapse (enterocele, rectocele,
perineal deficiency).
Types of interventions
Trials including any type of transvaginal graft compared with
transvaginal native tissue repair. Grafts included absorbable or per-
manent mesh materials or biological implants. We also evaluated
concomitant operations to treat or prevent urinary incontinence.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Awareness of prolapse
Defined as affirmative response to questions relating to awareness
of prolapse or vaginal bulge, or affirmative response to question
three of pelvic floor distress inventory (PFDI-20), “Do you usually
have a bulge or something falling out that you can see or feel in
the vaginal area?”.
2. Repeat surgery
2.1 Surgery for prolapse
2.2 Surgery for stress urinary incontinence
2.3 Surgery for prolapse, stress urinary incontinence, or mesh ex-
posure (composite outcome)
3. Recurrent prolapse

Search methods for identification of studies
We did not impose any language limits, however we did not in-
clude trials with fewer than 20 participants in each treatment
group.
Electronic searches
This review drew on the search strategy developed for the
Cochrane Incontinence Group. We identified relevant trials from
the Group’s Specialised Register of controlled trials which is de-
scribed, along with the Review Group search strategy, under the
Group’s module in the Cochrane Library. The Register contains
trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, Clinical-
Trials.gov, WHO ICTRP
, and handsearching of journals and con-
ference proceedings. We searched the Incontinence Group Spe-
cialised Register on 6 July 2015 using the Group’s own keyword
system; we have provided the search terms used in Appendix 2.
Searching other resources
We handsearched conference proceedings for the International
Urogynecology Society (IUGA) and International Continence So-
ciety (ICS) for podium presentations from 2012 to 2014. We
searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted re-
searchers in the field.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
8
Transvaginal mesh or grafts compared with native tissue repair for vaginal prolapse (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Two review authors assessed titles and, if available, abstracts of all
possibly eligible studies for compliance with the review inclusion
criteria. Two review authors then independently assessed full re-
ports of each study likely to be eligible. We have listed excluded
studies with the reasons for their exclusion in the Characteristics
of excluded studies table.
Data extraction and management
At least two review authors independently undertook data extrac-
tion, and comparisons were made to ensure accuracy. Discrep-
ancies were resolved by discussion or by referral to a third party.
Where trial data were not reported adequately, we attempted to
acquire the necessary information from the trialist.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently assessed the included studies
for risk of bias using the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ assessment tool
(www.cochrane-handbook.org) in order to assess: selection (ran-
dom sequence generation and allocation concealment); perfor-
mance (blinding of participants and personnel); detection (blind-
ing of outcome assessors); attrition (incomplete outcome data);
reporting (selective reporting); and other bias. Disagreements were
resolved by discussion or by a third review author. We described
all judgements fully and presented the conclusions in the ’Risk
of bias’ table, which was incorporated into the interpretation of
review findings by means of sensitivity analyses (see below).
Measures of treatment effect
For dichotomous data, we used the numbers of events in the con-
trol and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-
Haenszel risk ratios. For continuous data, if all studies reported
exactly the same outcomes, we calculated mean difference between
treatment groups. If similar outcomes were reported on different
scales, we planned to calculate the standardised mean difference.
We presented 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes. We com-
pared the magnitude and direction of effect reported by studies
with how they are presented in the review, taking account of legiti-
mate differences. We interpreted the standardised mean difference
as follows: an effect size of 0.2 is a small effect, an effect size of 0.5
is a medium effect, and an effect size of 0.8 is a large effect (Cohen
1988).
Unit of analysis issues
All analyses were per woman randomised.
Dealing with missing data
We analysedthe dataonanintention-to-treatbasisas faraspossible
and made attempts to obtain missing data from the original trialist.
Where these were unobtainable, we analysed only the available
data.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We considered whether the clinical and methodological charac-
teristics of the included studies were sufficiently similar for meta-
analysis to provide a clinically meaningful summary. We assessed
statistical heterogeneity by the measure of the I2. We took an I
2 measurement greater than 50% to indicate substantial hetero-
geneity (Higgins 2003).
Assessment of reporting biases
In view of the difficulty of detecting and correcting for publication
bias and other reporting biases, we aimed to minimise their poten-
tial impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies
and by being alert for duplication of data. If there were 10 or more
studies in an analysis, we planned to use a funnel plot to explore
the possibility of small-study effects (a tendency for estimates of
the intervention effect to be more beneficial in smaller studies).
Data synthesis
If the studies were sufficiently similar, we combined the data using
a fixed-effect model in the following three comparisons:
1. Transvaginal permanent mesh versus native tissue repair,
stratified by type of repair:
i) Anterior compartment permanent mesh versus native
tissue
ii) Multi-compartment (apical, anterior, and/or
posterior) permanent mesh repair versus native tissue
2. Absorbable mesh versus native tissue
3. Biological graft versus native tissue
An increase in the odds of a particular outcome, which may be
beneficial (for example patient’s global impression of improvement
)ordetrimental (forexample reoperationforprolapse), isdisplayed
graphically in the meta-analyses to the right of the centre-line, and
a decrease in the odds of an outcome to the left of the centre-line.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Where data were available, we considered the separate evidence
for the primary outcomes within the following subgroups:
• Anterior compartment repair only
• Multi-compartment repair (apical and/or anterior and/or
posterior)
We investigated differences between subgroups by means of a for-
mal test for significance (Chi2 test). We interpreted a low P value
(< 0.05) as evidence of differences between the subgroups (vari-
ation in effect estimates beyond chance). We also computed an
I2 statistic to describe the percentage of the variability in effect
9

 estimates from the different subgroups that is due to genuine sub-
group differences rather than sampling error (chance) (Higgins
2011).
If we detected substantial heterogeneity, we explored possible ex-
planations in sensitivity analyses. We took any statistical hetero-
geneity into account when interpreting the results, especially if
there was any variation in the direction of effect as described above.
Where there was substantial heterogeneity, we used a random-
effects model.
Sensitivity analysis
We conducted sensitivity analyses for the primary outcomes to
determine whether the conclusions were robust to arbitrary deci-
sions made regarding the eligibility and analysis. These analyses
included consideration of whether the review conclusions would
have differed if:
• eligibility had been restricted to studies without high risk of
bias (defined as studies with low risk of bias for sequence
generation and allocation concealment, and not at high risk of
bias in any domain);
• a random-effects model had been adopted;
• the summary effect measure had been odds ratio rather
than risk ratio.
Overall quality of the body of evidence: ’Summary of
findings’ table
We prepared a ’Summary of findings’ table using GRADEpro soft-
ware (GRADEPRO 2014). This table evaluated the overall qual-
ity of the body of evidence for the main review outcomes, using
GRADE criteria (study limitations (that is risk of bias), consis-
tency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias).
Judgements about evidence quality (high, moderate, low, or very
low) were justified, documented, and incorporated into reporting
of results for each outcome.
If we judged there to be serious risk of bias, inconsistency, im-
precision, indirectness, or suspicion of publication bias, we down-
graded the evidence by one level (for each domain affected). We
downgraded the evidence by two levels if the risk was considered
very serious.

 Included studies
Study design and setting
All of the 37 included studies were parallel-group randomised
controlled trials (RCTs). They were conducted in 15 countries
(Italy, USA, Australia, UK, the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium,
Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, India, Sweden,
and Turkey). Fifteen trials were multi-centre randomised trials
(Altman 2011; Dahlgren 2011; da Silveira 2014; Delroy 2013; De
Tayrac 2013; Guerette 2009; Halaska 2012; Iglesia 2010; Menefee
2011; Meschia2007; Nieminen2008; Rudnicki 2014; Sung 2012;
Vollebregt 2011; Withagen 2011).
Participants
The studies evaluated 4023 women, with 1986 undergoing
transvaginal graft repairs and 2037 undergoing traditional native
tissue repair (colporrhaphy).
Interventions

Vollebregt 2011; Withagen 2011).
i) Anterior compartment repair: 17 RCTs compared
permanent mesh versus native tissue for anterior compartment
repair (Ali 2006; Al-Nazer 2007; Altman 2011; Delroy 2013; De
Tayrac 2013; Gupta 2014; Lamblin 2014; Menefee 2011;

ii) Multi-compartment repair: Eight RCTs compared
permanent mesh versus native tissue for apical, anterior, and/or
posterior repair (Carey 2009; da Silveira 2014; De Tayrac 2008;
Halaska 2012; Iglesia 2010; Meschia 2004a; Svabik 2014;
Withagen 2011).
2. Absorbable mesh versus native tissue: three RCTs made this
comparison (Allahdin 2008; Sand 2001; Weber 2001).
3. Biological graft repair versus native tissue: 10 RCTs made
this comparison (Dahlgren 2011; Feldner 2010; Gandhi 2005;
Guerette 2009; Hviid 2010; Menefee 2011; Meschia 2007;
Paraiso 2006; Robert 2014; Sung 2012).
Outcomes
Most studies reported at least one of our primary outcomes and
reported data in a form suitable for analysis:
• Eighteen reported awareness of prolapse (Allahdin 2008;
Al-Nazer 2007; Altman 2011; Carey 2009; Dahlgren 2011; De
Tayrac 2013; Gandhi 2005; Gupta 2014; Hviid 2010; Iglesia
2010; Lamblin 2014; Meschia 2004a; Nieminen 2008; Paraiso
2006; Qatawneh 2013; Vollebregt 2011).
• Nineteen reported repeat surgery for prolapse,
incontinence, or for the composite outcome (prolapse,
incontinence, or mesh surgery) (Allahdin 2008; Altman 2011;
da Silveira 2014; De Tayrac 2013; Feldner 2010; Guerette 2009;
Halaska 2012; Hviid 2010; Iglesia 2010; Lamblin 2014;
Menefee 2011; Nguyen 2008; Nieminen 2008; Paraiso 2006;
Qatawneh 2013; Robert 2014; Tamanini 2014; Thijs 2010;
Turgal 2013; Vollebregt 2011; Withagen 2011).
• Twenty-five reported recurrent prolapse on objective
examination (Allahdin 2008; Al-Nazer 2007; Carey 2009; De
Tayrac 2008; De Tayrac 2013; Feldner 2010; Gandhi 2005;
Halaska 2012; Hviid 2010; Iglesia 2010; Menefee 2011; Nguyen
2008; Nieminen 2008; Paraiso 2006; Qatawneh 2013; Robert
2014; Rudnicki 2014; Sand 2001; Sivaslioglu 2008; Svabik
2014; Tamanini 2014; Turgal 2013; Vollebregt 2011; Weber
2001; Withagen 2011).
Two studies did not report any of our primary outcomes, but did
report at least one of our secondary outcomes (Ali 2006; Delroy
2013).
All trials reported outcomes with at least one year’s follow-up, apart
from one, Ali 2006, which had only six months’ follow-up. Eight
trials reported two-year outcomes (Allahdin 2008; Delroy 2013;
Guerette 2009; Lamblin 2014; Menefee 2011; Meschia 2007;
Tamanini 2014; Weber 2001), and three trials reported three-year
outcomes (Dahlgren 2011; Iglesia 2010; Nieminen 2008).
Where studies reported “mesh erosion” and did not differentiate
this from “mesh exposure”, we have included the data in analyses
of mesh exposure.
We have provided full details of the included trials in the
Characteristics of included studies table.
Excluded studies
We excluded five studies from the review (Altman 2013; Balci
2011; Chao 2012; Juneja 2010; Tincello 2009). We have provided
full details in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.

Allocation
Thirty of the included studies (30/37) adequately described se-
quence generation, and 17 described an adequate method of allo-
cation concealment (for example remote allocation or use of con-
secutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes).
We rated seven studies that did not clearly describe an adequate
method of sequence generation as at unclear risk of bias in this
domain.
We rated 18 studies that did not describe an adequate method of
allocation concealment as at unclear risk in this domain, and we
rated two studies as at high risk of bias, as they either did not use
allocation concealment, in Tamanini 2014, or we suspected a high
potential for bias (Withagen 2011).
See Figure 2 for details.
Blinding
Eight trials performed blinding of women and the postoperative
reviewer (Allahdin 2008; Altman 2011; Iglesia 2010; Menefee
2011; Nguyen 2008; Paraiso 2006; Robert 2014; Sung 2012).
Non-surgeons conducted outcome assessments in 10 trials (Al-
Nazer 2007; da Silveira 2014; Delroy 2013; Feldner 2010; Iglesia
2010; Meschia 2007; Paraiso 2006; Sung 2012; Svabik 2014;
Weber 2001).
We rated eight studies as at low risk of performance bias, 19 as at
unclear risk, and ten as at high risk of bias in this domain.
We rated 12 RCTs as at low risk of detection bias, 17 as at unclear
risk, and eight as at high risk of bias in this domain.
Incomplete outcome data
Loss to follow-up varied, ranging from zero, in Allahdin 2008 and
Meschia 2004a, to 53%, in Guerette 2009 (49/93). Weber also
reported a significantly higher loss to follow-up in one arm of the
trial (ultra-lateral anterior vaginal wall repair) (Weber 2001).
We rated 22 RCTs as at low risk of attrition bias, five as at unclear
risk, and 10 as at high risk of bias in this domain.
Selective reporting
Thirty-two studies clearly reported at least one of our primary
outcomes and were deemed to be at low risk of selective reporting.
We rated three studies as at unclear risk of selective reporting
because they did not report any of our primary outcomes (Ali
2006; Delroy 2013), or else did not report data separately for
the two groups (Weber 2001). We rated one study as at high
risk of selective reporting because the choice of primary outcome
appeared to be inconsistent (Withagen 2011).
Other potential sources of bias
All trials reported baseline descriptive characteristics, and there
was no evidence of a difference between the groups, except in three
trials: in Sand 2001, previous hysterectomy was more common
in the mesh overlay group; in Withagen 2011, women in the
native tissue group had greater degree prolapse at point A posterior
(Ap), point B posterior (Bp), and genital hiatus (GH) compared
to the mesh group, and prior sacral colpopexy was three times
more frequent in the mesh group; and in Lamblin 2014, the rate
of concomitant hysterectomy was twice as common in the vaginal
colposuspension group (77%) as in the mesh group (33%, P <
0.001).

 All trials reported preoperative prolapse status, but two trials did
not specifically report equal distribution and severity of prolapse
between groups (Ali 2006; Sand 2001), and Weber 2001 included
7% of women with stage 1 anterior vaginal wall prolapse preopera-
tively (at time of inclusion), which would also have been classified
as a postoperative success.
We rated 12 RCTs as at low risk of other bias, 16 as at unclear
risk, and six as at high risk of bias in this domain.

Biological repair versus native tissue repair for vaginal prolapse
1. Permanent mesh versus native tissue repair
Twenty-five RCTs made this comparison. They compared per-
manent mesh versus native tissue repair in women having ei-
ther anterior or multi-compartment repair (Ali 2006; Al-Nazer
2007; Altman 2011; Carey 2009; da Silveira 2014; Delroy 2013;
De Tayrac 2008; De Tayrac 2013; Gupta 2014; Halaska 2012;
Iglesia 2010; Lamblin 2014; Menefee 2011; Meschia 2004a;
Nguyen 2008; Nieminen 2008; Qatawneh 2013; Rudnicki 2014;
Sivaslioglu 2008; Svabik 2014; Tamanini 2014; Thijs2010;Turgal
2013; Vollebregt 2011; Withagen 2011).
Primary outcomes
1.1 Awareness of prolapse (one- to three-year review)
Women who had permanent transvaginal mesh repair were less
likely to report awareness of prolapse than women who had native
tissue repair (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.54 to 0.81, 12 RCTs, n = 1614, I2 = 3%, moderate-quality evi-
dence). This suggests that if 19% of women are aware of prolapse
after native tissue repair, between 10% and 15% will be aware of
prolapse after permanent mesh repair. (Analysis 1.1; Figure 4)

 1.1.1 Subgroup analysis by extent of repair
When we subgrouped the analysis by extent of repair, there was
no evidence of a significant difference between the subgroups: test
for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 0.01, df = 1 (P = 0.94), I2 = 0%.
1.2 Repeat surgery (one- to three-year review)
1.2.1 Surgery for prolapse
The rate of repeat surgery for prolapse was lower in the mesh group
(RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.88, 12 RCTs, n = 1675; I2= 0%,
moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that if 3% of women
undergo repeat prolapse surgery after traditional repair, between
1% and 3% will require repeat prolapse surgery after transvaginal
mesh repair. (Analysis 1.2)
1.2.2 Surgery for stress urinary incontinence
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in the
rate of repeat surgery for stress urinary incontinence (RR 1.07,
95% CI 0.62 to 1.83, 9 RCTs, n = 1284, I2 = 21%, low-quality
evidence). (Analysis 1.2)
1.2.3 Surgery for prolapse, stress urinary incontinence, or
mesh exposure
Women who had a transvaginal mesh repair were more likely to
undergo repeat surgery for prolapse, stress urinary incontinence,
or mesh exposure than those undergoing native tissue repair (RR
2.40, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.81, 7 RCTs, n = 867, I2 = 0%, moderate-
quality evidence). This suggests that if 5% of women who undergo
native tissue repair require subsequent surgery to manage prolapse,
stress urinary incontinence, or mesh exposure, between 7% and
18% would require repeat surgery after transvaginal permanent
mesh repair. (Analysis 1.2)
1.3 Recurrent prolapse (stage 2 or greater prolapse on
examination at any vaginal site) (one- to three-year review)
Women who had transvaginal mesh repair were less likely to have
stage 2 or greater prolapse on examination at any vaginal site than
after a native tissue repair (random-effects model; RR 0.40, 95%
CI 0.30 to 0.53, 21 RCTs, n = 2494; I2 = 73%, low-quality ev-
idence). This suggests that if 38% of women have prolapse on
examination after native tissue repair, between 11% and 20% will
have prolapse on examination after transvaginal mesh repair. Het-
erogeneity was high for this analysis, mainly due to differences in
the effect size in studies of multi-compartment repair. However,
the direction of effect was consistent. (Analysis 1.3)
1.3.1 Subgroup analysis by extent of repair
The test for subgroup differences indicated a statistically signifi-
cant difference between the two subgroups: test for subgroup dif-
ferences: Chi2 = 6.97, df = 1 (P = 0.008), I2 = 85.7%.
• 1.3.1.1 Anterior repair only
When the analysis was limited to anterior compartment repair, the
benefit in the mesh group was more pronounced, and statistical
heterogeneity was much reduced (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.40,
15 RCTs, n = 1748, I2 = 10%). (Analysis 1.3)
• 1.3.1.2 Multi-compartment repair
When the analysis was limited to studies of multi-compartment
repair, the benefit in the mesh group persisted but to a lesser mag-
nitude (random-effects model; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.87, 6
RCTs, n = 746, I2 = 76%). (Analysis 1.3)
Secondary outcomes
1.4 Adverse events
1.4.1 Death
None of the included studies reported this outcome.
1.4.2 Mesh exposure (19 RCTs, one- to three-year review)
While a woman undergoing a native tissue repair has no risk of
mesh exposure, overall 134/1097 (12%) women in the transvagi-
nal permanent mesh groups had mesh exposure (Table 1).
• 1.4.2.1 Subgroup analysis by extent of repair
Anterior repair only: Mesh exposure was reported in 10% (76/
753) women after anterior permanent mesh repairs (Table 2).
Multi-compartment repair: Mesh exposure was reported in
17% (58/344) women after multi-compartment mesh repair
(Table 3).

 1.4.3 Injuries to the bladder or bowel
Women undergoing a transvaginal permanent mesh repair were
more likelyto have a bladder injury than those undergoing a native
tissue repair (RR 3.92, 95% CI 1.62 to 9.50, 11 RCTs, n = 1514, I2
= 0%, moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that if the bladder
injury rate at a native tissue repair was 0.5%, then between 1%
and 6% of women would have a bladder injury at a transvaginal
mesh repair. (Analysis 1.4)
Only a single trial reported bowel injury as an outcome, and there
was no evidence of a difference between the two groups (RR 3.26,
95% CI 0.13 to 78.81, 1 RCT, n = 169). (Analysis 1.4)
1.4.4 Surgery for mesh exposure (one- to three-year review)
Surgery for mesh exposure was required in 8% of women (100/
1227) (Table 4).
1.5 Prolapse outcomes
1.5.1 Objective failure (one- to three-year review)
• 1.5.1.1 Objective failure of anterior compartment
Women who had a transvaginal mesh repair were less likely to have
a stage 2 or greater anterior compartment prolapse on examination
than those undergoing a native tissue repair (RR 0.45, 95% CI
0.36 to 0.55, 13 RCTs, n = 1406, I2 = 35%). (Analysis 1.5)
Subgroup analysis by extent of repair
The test for subgroup differences indicated a statistically signifi-
cant difference between the two subgroups: test for subgroup dif-
ferences: Chi2 = 9.76, df = 1 (P = 0.002), I2 = 89.8%.
1. Anterior repair only: When the analysis was limited to
studies of anterior compartment repair, the benefit in the mesh
group was more pronounced (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.47, 9
RCTs, n = 1004, I2 = 0%).
2. Multi-compartment repair: When the analysis was limited
to studies of multi-compartment repair, there was no conclusive
evidence of a difference between the groups (RR 0.73, 95% CI
0.51 to 1.06, 4 RCTs, n = 402, I2 = 0%). (Analysis 1.5)
• 1.5.1.2 Objective failure of apical compartment
None of the included studies reported this outcome.
• 1.5.1.3 Objective failure of posterior vaginal compartment
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in rates
of grade 2 or greater posterior compartment prolapse (RR 0.64,
95% CI 0.29 to 1.42, 3 RCTs, n = 226, I2 = 0%). (Analysis 1.6)
• 1.5.1.4 Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POPQ) scores
Point Ba (mid-anterior vaginal wall)
Evidence suggested that Point Ba on the mid-anterior vaginal wall
had better support after transvaginal permanent mesh repair than
after native tissue repair (random-effects model; MD -0.93, 95%
CI -1.27 to -0.59, 10 RCTs, n = 1125, I2 = 86%). This result
should be interpreted very cautiously as there was substantial het-
erogeneity between studies. However, the direction of effect was
consistent. (Analysis 1.7)
Point C (vaginal apex)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups at Point
C (random-effects model; mean difference (MD) -0.45, 95% CI
-1.13 to 0.23, 8 RCTs, n = 925, I2 = 82%). (Analysis 1.7). This
result should be interpreted very cautiously as there was substantial
heterogeneity between studies, and the directions of effect were
not consistent.
Point Bp (mid-posterior vaginal wall)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups at Point
Bp (random-effects model; MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.44, 7
RCTs, n = 832, I2 = 86%). This result should be interpreted very
cautiously as there was substantial heterogeneity between studies,
and the directions of effect were not consistent. (Analysis 1.7)
• 1.5.1.5 Total vaginal length (cm)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in to-
tal vaginal length (random-effects model; MD 0.07, 95% CI -
0.25 to 0.40; 5 RCTs, n = 611; I2 = 43%). This result should be
interpreted very cautiously as there was substantial heterogeneity
between studies, and the directions of effect were not consistent.
(Analysis 1.7)
1.6 Bladder function
1.6.1 Stress urinary incontinence
None of the included studies reported this outcome.
1.6.2 De novo stress urinary incontinence ( one- to three-year
review)
Women undergoing a transvaginal permanent mesh repair were
more likely to develop de novo stress urinary incontinence than
those undergoing native tissue repair (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.06 to
1.82, 12 RCTs, n = 1512, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence). This
suggests that if 10% of women developed urinary stress inconti-
nence after native tissue repair, 10% to 17% would develop uri-
nary stress incontinence after a transvaginal permanent mesh re-
pair. (Analysis 1.8)
• 1.6.2.1 Subgroup analysis by site of repair
When we subgrouped the analysis by extent of repair, there was
no evidence of a significant difference between the subgroups: test
for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 0.14, df = 1 (P = 0.71), I2 = 0%.

 1.6.3 De novo bladder voiding difficulties or urgency
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in the
rate of de novo voiding disorder, urgency, detrusor overactivity, or
overactive bladder (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.63, 3 RCTs, n =
236, I2 = 0%). (Analysis 1.9)
1.7 Bowel function
1.7.1 De novo faecal incontinence or obstructed defecation
None of the included studies reported this outcome in a format
suitable for analysis.
1.8 Sexual function
1.8.1 De novo dyspareunia (one- to three-year review)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in the
rate of de novo dyspareunia (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.47, 11
RCTs, n = 764; I2 = 21%). (Analysis 1.10)
• 1.8.1.1 Subgroup analysis by extent of repair
When we subgrouped the analysis by extent of repair, there was no
evidence of a significant difference between the subgroups: test for
subgroup differences: Chi2 = 1.05, df = 1 (P = 0.31), I2 = 4.7%.
1.8.2 Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual
Questionnaire
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in pro-
lapse-specific sexual function questionnaire scores (MD -0.13, 95
CI -0.40 to 0.13, 7 RCTs, n = 857, I2 = 0%). (Analysis 1.11)
1.9 Quality of life and satisfaction measures (one- to two-
year review)
Quality of life was measured by post-treatment scores (end scores)
on the Prolapse Quality of Life Questionnaire (3 RCTs) or the
Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (4 RCTs).
When we combined data to calculate standardised mean differ-
ences, we found no evidence of a difference between the groups
(standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.05, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.30,
7 RCTs, 665 women, I2 = 60%; Analysis 1.12). These findings
should be interpreted with caution as there was substantial het-
erogeneity between studies, and the directions of effect were not
consistent.
One studyreportedthisoutcome usingadichotomous measure for
PatientGlobal Impressionof Improvement. There wasnoevidence
of a difference between the groups in the number of women who
reported feeling “much or very much better” (RR 1.00, 95% CI
0.80 to 1.25, 1 RCT, n = 168). (Analysis 1.13)
1.10 Measures associated with surgery
1.10.1 Operating time (mins)
Twelve studies reported this outcome. While the evidence strongly
suggests shorter operating time in non-mesh group due to signif-
icant heterogeneity (I2 = 97%) and inconsistency in the direction
of effect the data were not pooled.
Mean operating time ranged across studies from 53 minutes longer
in the mesh group to 11 minutes shorter in the mesh group. (
Analysis 1.14)
• 1.10.1.1 Subgroup analysis by extent of repair
Anterior compartment repair: We did not pool studies due
to extreme heterogeneity (I2 = 97%) and inconsistency in the
direction of effect. Five of the ten studies reported that mean
operating time was at least 15 minutes longer in the mesh group.
Four studies found no difference between the groups, and one
reported that the mean operating time was five minutes shorter in
the mesh group.
Multi-compartment repair: When multi-compartment repairs
were considered in isolation, the mean operating time was shorter
in the mesh group (MD -7.48 minutes, 95% CI -10.87 to -4.08, 3
RCTs, n = 295, I2 = 0%). (Analysis 1.14) (data shown unpooled)
1.10.2 Blood transfusion
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in the
rate of blood transfusion (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.72, 6 RCTs,
n = 723, I2 = 0%). (Analysis 1.15)
1.10.3 Length of hospital stay (days) (7 RCTs)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in du-
ration of admission (random-effects model; MD -0.06 days, 95%
CI -0.03 to 0.18, 7 RCTs, n = 953, I2 = 68%). (Analysis 1.16)
See Summary of findings for the main comparison
2.0 Absorbable mesh versus native tissue repair
Three trials evaluated the effects of using absorbable polyglactin
(Vicryl) mesh inlay to augment prolapse repairs (Allahdin 2008;
Sand 2001; Weber 2001). We pooled limited data from these
trials. In Weber 2001, data from non-mesh native tissue arms were
combined.

 Primary outcomes
2.1 Awareness of prolapse (two-year review)
A single trial reported no evidence of a difference in awareness of
prolapse between women undergoing absorbable mesh repair and
those undergoing native tissue vaginal repair (colporrhaphy) (RR
1.05, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.44, 1 RCT, n = 54, very low-quality evi-
dence). This suggests that if 72% of women are aware of prolapse
after native tissue repair, then between 55% and 100% would be
aware of prolapse after an absorbable mesh repair. (Analysis 2.1)
2.2 Repeat surgery (two-year review)
A single trial reported no evidence of a difference between the
two groups in the rate of repeat surgery for prolapse (RR 0.47,
95% CI 0.09 to 2.40, 1 RCT, n = 66, very low-quality evidence).
This suggests that if 13% of women required repeat surgery for
prolapse after a native tissue repair, then between 1% to 30%
would require repeat surgery for prolapse after an absorbable mesh
repair. (Analysis 2.2)
2.3 Recurrent prolapse (three-months to two-year review)
Three RCTs reported this outcome. Two RCTs had follow-up of
one year, in Sand 2001, or nearly two years, in Weber 2001. The
third, Allahdin 2008, had only three months’ follow-up for this
outcome.
Rates of any recurrent prolapse on examination were lower in the
absorbable mesh group (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96, 3 RCTs,
n = 292, I2 = 21%, low-quality evidence). However, this finding
was sensitive to choice of statistical model, and was not statistically
significant when we used a random-effects model (RR 0.74, 95%
CI0.51to1.06). Thissuggeststhatif 43% of womenhad recurrent
prolapse on examination after native tissue repair, then between
22% and 41% would have recurrent prolapse after an absorbable
mesh repair. (Analysis 2.3)
2.3.1 Subgroup analysis by extent of repair
There was no evidence of a difference between the two subgroups:
test for subgroup differences: Chi2 = 0.14, df = 1 (P = 0.71), I2 =
0%.
Secondary outcomes
2.4 Adverse events
2.4.1 Death (2 RCTs)
No deaths related to surgery were reported. (Analysis 2.4)
Other adverse events were unreported in the included studies.
2.5 Prolapse outcomes
2.5.1 Objective failure (one- to two-year review)
• 2.5.1.1 Objective failure of anterior compartment (2 RCTs)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in grade
2 or greater anterior compartment prolapse on examination (RR
0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.98, 2 RCTs, n = 226; I2 = 57%, very low-
quality evidence). (Analysis 2.5)
• 2.5.1.2 Objective failure of apical compartment
None of the included studies reported this outcome.
• 2.5.1.3 Objective failure of posterior compartment (1 RCT)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in grade
2 or greater posterior compartment prolapse on examination (RR
1.13, 95% CI 0.40 to 3.19, 1 RCT, n = 132, very low-quality
evidence). (Analysis 2.6)
• 2.5.1.4 POPQ scores
None of the included studies reported this outcome.
2.6 Bladder function
2.6.1 Postoperative stress urinary incontinence (two-year
review)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in the
rate of postoperative stress incontinence (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.95
to 2.00, 1 RCT, n = 49, very low-quality evidence). (Analysis 2.7)
Other outcomes were not reported in the included studies.

 2.9 Quality of life
2.9.1 Prolapse Quality of Life Questionnaire (1 RCT, 2-year
review)
A single trial reported no evidence of a difference between the
groups in quality of life scores, measured using end scores on a 0
to 10 visual analogue scale (“How much do prolapse symptoms
interfere with everyday life?” 0 = not at all, 10 = a great deal) (MD
0.00, 95% CI -2.82 to 2.82, 1 RCT, n = 54). (Analysis 2.8)

3. Biological graft versus native tissue repair
Ten studies compared biological grafts versus native tissue; eight
were porcine grafts (Dahlgren 2011; Feldner 2010; Hviid 2010;
Menefee 2011; Meschia 2007; Paraiso 2006; Robert 2014;
Sung 2012), one cadaveric (Gandhi 2005), and one was bovine
(Guerette 2009).
Primary outcomes
3.1 Awareness of prolapse (one to three year review)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups (RR
0.97, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.43, 7 RCTs, n = 777, I2 = 27%, low-
quality evidence). This suggests that if 10% of women were aware
of prolapse after a native tissue repair, between 7% and 15% would
be aware of prolapse after biological graft repair. (Analysis 3.1;
Figure 5)

 quality evidence). This suggests that if 4% of women required
repeat prolapse surgery after native tissue repair, then between 3%
to 10% would require repeat prolapse surgery after biological graft
repair. (Analysis 3.2)
3.2.2 Surgery for stress urinary incontinence
None of the included studies reported this outcome.
3.3 Recurrent prolapse (one-year review)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups (RR
0.94, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.47, 7 RCTs, n = 587, I2 = 59%, very
low-quality evidence). This suggests that if 30% of women had
recurrent prolapse after a native tissue repair, then between 18%
and 33% would have recurrent prolapse on examination after a
biological graft repair. (Analysis 3.3)
• 3.3.1 Subgroup analysis by extent of repair
The test for subgroup differences indicated a statistically signifi-
cant difference between the two subgroups: test for subgroup dif-
ferences: Chi² = 9.12, df = 1 (P = 0.003), I² = 89.0%
1. Anterior repair only: When the analysis was limited to
studies of anterior compartment repair, there was no conclusive
evidence of a difference between the groups (RR 0.75, 95% CI
0.54 to 1.05, 5 RCTs, n=369, I2=12%)
2. Posterior compartment repair: When the analysis was
limited to studies of posterior compartment repair, there was a
higher risk of prolapse in the native tissue group (RR 2.09, 95%
CI 1.18 to 3.70, 2 RCTs, n=218, I2=0%)
Secondary outcomes
3.4 Adverse events
3.4.3 Injury to the bladder or bowel
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups for
this outcome, and only one event occurred in each comparison
(bladder injury: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.40, 1 RCT, n = 137;
bowel injury: RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.13 to 75.57, 1 RCT, n = 137,
very low-quality evidence). (Analysis 3.4)
3.5 Prolapse outcomes
3.5.1 Objective failure (one-year review)
• 3.5.1.1 Objective failure of anterior compartment
Women who had biological graft repair were less likely to have an
objective failure of the anterior compartment than women having
native tissue repair (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.96, 6 RCTs, n =
570, I2 = 33%). (Analysis 3.5)
• 3.5.1.2 Objective failure of apical compartment
None of the included studies reported this outcome.
• 3.5.1.3 Objective failure of posterior vaginal compartment (3
RCTs)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups (ran-
dom-effects model; RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.51, 3 RCTs, n =
283, I2 = 80%). (Analysis 3.6). This result should be interpreted
cautiously as there was substantial heterogeneity between studies,
and the directions of effect were not consistent.
• 3.5.1.4 POPQ scores
Point Ba (mid-anterior vaginal wall)
Evidence suggested that there was greater support at point Ba after
the biological graft repair compared to native tissue repair (MD -
0.50, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.02, 1 RCT, n = 56). (Analysis 3.7)
Point C (vaginal apex)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups at point
C (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.28 to 0.08, 1 RCT, n = 56). (Analysis
3.7)
Point Bp (mid-posterior vaginal wall)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups at point
Bp (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.47, 1 RCT, n = 56). (Analysis
3.7)
Total vaginal length
Total vaginal length waslongerafterthe biological repaircompared
to native tissue repair (MD 0.60, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.14, 1 RCT, n
= 56). (Analysis 3.7)
3.6 Bladder function
3.6.1 De novo stress urinary incontinence (1 RCT)
One study (n = 93) reported de novo stress urinary incontinence,
but there were no events. (Analysis 3.8)
3.6.2 De novo urinary dysfunction (bladder overactivity and
voiding dysfunction) (2 RCTs)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups (RR

3.8 Sexual function
3.8.1 De novo dyspareunia (one-year review)
There was no evidence of a difference between the groups, but
only six events were reported (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.67, 1
RCT, n = 37, very low-quality evidence). (Analysis 3.10)
3.8.2 Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual
Questionnaire
There was no evidence of a difference between groups (MD 1,
95% CI -2.33 to 4.33, 1 RCT, n = 35, very low-quality evidence).
3.9 Quality of life (1-year review)
Two studies used validated prolapse-specific quality of life ques-
tionnaires in which higher scores indicated greater dysfunction,
and there was no evidence of a difference between the groups
(SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.38, 2 RCTs, n = 84, I2 = 0%).
(Analysis 3.12)
3.10 Measures associated with surgery
3.10.1 Operating time
Duration of surgery was longer after native tissue repair than after
biological graft repair (MD 10.34 minutes, 95% CI 6.31 to 14.36,
4 RCTs, n = 232, I2 = 0%). (Analysis 3.13)
3.10.2 Blood transfusion
Only one study reported this outcome in a format suitable for
analysis. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups
(RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.14 to 32.90, 1 RCT, n = 100).
3.10.3 Length of hospital stay
None of the included studies reported this outcome.

Other analyses
We conductedthe prespecifiedsensitivityanalysesbystudyquality,
choice of statistical model, and choice of effect estimate. None
of these substantially influenced the main findings, except for
Analysis 2.3, which was sensitive to the choice of statistical model.
As noted above, when we used a random-effects model there was
no significant difference between biological graft repair and native
tissue repair in the rate of recurrent prolapse on examination.
We constructed a funnel plot for Analysis 1.3, which included
13 studies comparing permanent mesh versus native tissue repair,
for the outcome of recurrent prolapse. The funnel plot was not
strongly suggestive of publication bias. (Figure 6)

Transvaginal mesh or grafts compared with native tissue repair for vaginal prolapse (Review)

Summary of main results
When any transvaginal permanent mesh was compared to any na-
tive tissue vaginal repair, the advantages included decreased aware-
nessof prolapse, prolapse onexamination,and reoperation forpro-
lapse. However, the rate of bladder injury, de novo stress urinary
incontinence, and reoperation for prolapse, stress urinary incon-
tinence or mesh exposure (composite outcome) was lower after a
native tissue repair. This risk profile suggests, at best, that the util-
isation of transvaginal permanent mesh needs to be individualised
to those who accept the benefits and risk of these interventions.
The quality of the evidence supporting these findings ranges from
low to moderate for most comparisons.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The 37 trials we assessed in this review allow an extensive review
of the transvaginal grafts compared to native tissue repairs. The
primary outcomes of awareness of prolapse, repeat surgery, and
recurrent prolapse were generally well reported. Significant varia-
tion exists in the definitions of primary and secondary outcomes,
which reduced our ability to include these outcomes in a meta-
analysis. Reporting of standardised anatomical, functional, and
adverse events related to pelvic organ prolapse interventions in
RCTs will reduce these problems in the future. Data relating to
the impact of interventions on bowel function and cost evaluation
of the interventions were poorly reported. Since the publication
of the first version of this review, many of the transvaginal perma-
nent meshes have been voluntarily withdrawn from the market. To
date, the newer, lightweight transvaginal permanent meshes that
remain on the market have not been evaluated under the auspices
of a RCT.
While the rate of mesh exposure reported is consistent with previ-
ous reports, one of the main concerns in the FDA 2011 transvagi-
nal mesh alert was the rate of vaginal pain or dyspareunia, or
both, which accounted for over one-third of the reported adverse
events. Contrary to this, in the nearly 2500 women undergoing
a transvaginal mesh repair in this systematic review, surgery for
vaginal pain or dyspareunia related to the transvaginal mesh was
barely mentioned. One possible explanation for this disparity is
that while the incidence of vaginal pain requiring surgery follow-
ing transvaginal mesh surgery may be low, the individual morbid-
ity may be greater than with native tissue repairs, resulting in a
higher tendency to report this adverse event. In this review, vali-
dated quality of life and pelvic floor function questionnaires were
unable to detect a difference between the groups. Finally, the gen-
erally short follow-up time after transvaginal polypropylene mesh
intervention may not identify all the potential adverse events.
Quality of the evidence
The risk of bias in primary studies has generally decreased since
our previous review, with the randomisation process being well re-
ported. Reporting of allocation concealment, Consolidated Stan-
dards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow diagrams, and meth-
ods of blinding of participants and reviewers is improving.
The quality of evidence when comparing transvaginal permanent
mesh to native tissue was low to moderate for most outcomes,
the most common limitations being poor reporting of methods,
imprecision and inconsistency (Summary of findings for the main
comparison).
The quality of evidence comparing absorbable mesh to native tis-
sue repairs was generally very low to low, reflecting smaller, older
studies with poor reporting of methods, high rates of attrition,
and lack of blinding, and imprecision (Summary of findings 2).
The quality of evidence comparing biological grafts to native tissue
repairs was very low to low, reflecting poor reporting of study
methods, lack of clarity with regard to blinding of assessors, and
imprecision (Summary of findings 3).
Overall, the main limitations were poor reporting of study meth-
ods, inconsistency, and imprecision.
Potential biases in the review process
The authors of this review did not conduct any of the trials being
evaluated. The review authors have no conflicts of interest to re-
port.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Recent reviews have evaluated the safely of transvaginal mesh in
the treatment of female pelvic floor. The 2015 European Commis-
sion report on the safety of transvaginal meshes utilised in urog-
ynaecology surgery concluded that the implantation of any mesh
for the treatment of POP via the vaginal route should be only con-
sidered in complex cases, in particular after failed primary repair
surgery (SCENHIR 2015). The New Zealand Accident Compen-
sation Corporation also reported in 2015 on complications related
to all surgical meshes for hernia, urinary incontinence and pro-
lapse surgeries. They found that the rate of complications related
to transvaginal polypropylene mesh was five time higher when
utilised in prolapse repairs compared to both urinary incontinence
and hernia repairs (ACC 2015). Both of these findings are rela-
tively consistent with our findings.
The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA) reported in late 2014 after reviewing literature until
2012, taking submissions from support groups, reviewing adverse
events reports made to MHRA, and engaging with professional
organisations and regulatory bodies worldwide (MHRA 2014).
The full report was extensive and concluded that based on the
available data:10.1002/14651858.CD006375.pub3
• for the majority of women, the use of vaginal mesh
implants is safe and effective;
28

 • when these products are used correctly they can help
alleviate the very distressing symptoms of stress urinary
incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, and as such the benefits
still outweigh the risks.
Our review suggests that while permanent transvaginal mesh is
associated with a greater reduction in prolapse on examination,
awareness of prolapse and reoperation for prolapse than native
tissue repairs, it is associated with increased morbidity, including a
higher rate of bladder injury, de novo stress urinary incontinence,
and reoperation rates for prolapse, stress urinary incontinence,
and/or mesh exposure. The rate of mesh exposure was 12%, and
surgery for mesh exposure was required in 8%, accounting for
most of the reoperations for mesh complications. We conclude,
in contrast to the MHRA 2014 report, that while there may be
individual cases of anterior compartment prolapse where mesh
utilisation may be warranted, it cannot be considered a first-line
treatment option for pelvic organ prolapse, due to the associated
morbidity.
Furthermore, and in contrast to the MHRA 2014 report, we have
highlighted that most of data informing our report was derived
from transvaginal mesh products that were voluntarily removed
from the market in 2012, and that transvaginal mesh products
currently available for use have not been evaluated by RCTs. We
believe it is prudent that until such data become available, the
currentlyavailable transvaginal mesh productsshouldbe utilisedin
a clinical setting under the discretion of the local ethics committee.
A recent Cochrane systematic review (Ford 2015) assessed mid-
urethral sling operations for the treatment of women with stress
urinary incontinence. It included comparisons of different surgical
routes, different types of synthetic tape and types of tape insertion.
The review authors concluded that the surgery has a good safety
profile and is highly effective in the short and medium term. This
review has limited applicability to the current review, as it included
women with or without pelvic prolapse; most trials did not report
whether prolapse was present. Moreover none of the trials directly
compared traditional anterior repair (with native tissue) to mid-
urethral synthetic sling.

Implications for practice
While transvaginal permanent mesh is associated with lower rates
of awareness of prolapse, repeat surgery for prolapse, and prolapse
on examination than native tissue repair, it is also associated with
higher rates of repeat surgery for prolapse or stress urinary inconti-
nence or mesh exposure (as a composite outcome), and with higher
rates of bladder injury at surgery and de novo stress urinary in-
continence. The risk-benefit profile means that transvaginal mesh
has limited utility in primary surgery. While it is possible that in
women with higher risk of recurrence the benefits may outweigh
the risks, there is currently no evidence to support this position.
Limited evidence suggests that absorbable mesh may reduce the
riskof recurrentprolapse onexaminationcomparedtonative tissue
repair, but there was insufficient evidence on absorbable mesh for
us to draw any conclusions for other outcomes.
In 2011, many of the transvaginal permanent meshes evaluated in
this review were voluntarily withdrawn from the market. To date,
the newer, lightweight transvaginal permanent meshes that remain
of the market have not been evaluated within a RCT. Until such
data become available, these newer transvaginal meshes should be
utilised under the discretion of the ethics committee.
Implications for research
In the short term, urgent evaluation of newer, lighter transvaginal
mesh products that remain on the market is required. Unfortu-
nately, at least two trials have received ethical committee approval
comparing the new lightweight mesh with either sacral colpopexy
or transanal repair (NCT01097200; NCT01497171), but have
been terminated due to difficulty in recruiting or lack of fund-
ing. These products should also be compared to native tissue re-
pairs and sacral colpopexy. In the medium to long term, the de-
velopment of newer, self rejuvenating products through tissue en-
gineering and bio-design should be funded, and the efficacy, sa-
fety, and cost of the interventions assessed. A cost-benefit analysis
of transvaginal mesh is needed, and the long-term outcomes of
meshes already evaluated should also be undertaken.

 Dahlgren 2011
Methods
Multi-centre (8) Swedish open RCT
Computer-generated block randomisation stratified for each centre
Allocation concealment in opaque, sealed envelopes
Sample size was based on the assumption that a 15% difference in objective cure rate
after 3 years between the implant-augmented repair and the traditional colporrhaphy
with 90% power should be significant at a 5% level. It was estimated that 160 women,
80 in each arm of the study, including a drop-out of 10%, were needed
3-year review
ITT and CONSORT guidelines reporting not stated
Participants
Inclusion: recurrent (prior surgery on the prolapsing site) POP in anterior or posterior
compartment, or both

tion: inlay anchored to vaginal wall and fascia 6-8 polydioxanone sutures, vagina closed
polyglactin suture
Concomitant mid-urethral sling, apical support, and levator plication performed as re-
quired
Outcomes
Assessed at 3 months and 3 years

Methods
2-centre, double-blinded randomised control trial
Allocation concealment: sealed envelopes
Randomisation block and stratified site
Women and assessors blinded (women unblinded 12 months)
Based on a study by Kohli et al (Kohli 2003) assuming that graft use is associated with
a 93% anatomic success rate, 63 women per group would be needed to detect a 20%
difference at .05 and .20. We aimed to recruit 160 women (80 women per group) to
account for drop-out
Participants
Inclusion criteria: women with stage 2 or greater symptomatic rectocele (defined as
vaginal bulge, defecatory symptoms, or both) electing surgical repair were eligible
Exclusion criteria: < 18 years, women undergoing concomitant sacrocolpopexy or col-
orectal procedures, history of porcine allergy, connective tissue disease, pelvic malig-
nancy, pelvic radiation, inability to understand English, or unable or unwilling to con-
sent or comply with follow-up. All other vaginal prolapse repairs and anti-incontinence
procedures were included
Interventions
Gp A: 70 controls midline plication or site-specific repair
Gp B: 67 midline plication or site-specific repair with 4 x 7 cm subintestinal submucosal
graft over the repair and secured to levator ani fascia using interrupted No. 2-0 polygly-
colic acid and inferiorly to the perineal body using No. 2-0 polyglycolic acid sutures
Excess vaginal tissue was trimmed in all women, and the posterior vaginal incision was
closed using 2-0 polyglycolic acid sutures. The deep and superficial transverse perineal
muscles and bulbocavernosus muscles were re-approximated using No. 0
polyglycolic acid sutures, and concomitant perineorrhaphy was performed in all women
Outcomes
Assessed at 6 months and 1 year
Reports the following outcomes at median 12.2 to 12.5 months (range 10 to 43 months)

 A P P E N D I C E S
Appendix 1. Types of operations
Sacral colpopexy
Aim
to correct upper genital tract prolapse
Indication
Usually reserved for recurrent prolapse of the upper vagina (recurrent cystocele, vault or enterocele) or massive vaginal eversion
Surgical technique
• Usually performed under general anaesthesia
• Performed through an incision on the lower abdomen or keyhole
• The bladder and rectum are freed from the vagina and permanent mesh supports the front and back wall of the vagina
• This mesh is secured to the sacrum (upper tailbone)
• Peritoneum (lining of the abdominal cavity) is closed over the mesh
• Other repairs are performed as required at the same time including paravaginal repair, perineoplasty, colposuspension or
rectopexy
• Bowel preparation is required prior to the surgery
McCall culdoplasty
Indications
• Vault prolapse or an enterocele
• Often performed at the time of vaginal hysterectomy to prevent future prolapse
Surgical technique
• After the uterus is removed at the time of hysterectomy the uterosacral ligaments are identified and incorporated into the closure
of the peritoneum and upper vagina using one to two sutures
• An anterior or posterior vaginal repair is often performed at the same time
Sacrospinous fixation
Aim
This surgery offers support to the upper vagina, minimising risk of recurrent prolapse at this site. The advantage of this surgery is that
vaginal length is maintained.
Indication
Upper vaginal prolapse (uterine or vault prolapse, enteroceles)
This procedure can be used in reconstructive vaginal surgery where increased vaginal length is required.
Procedure
• The procedure can be performed under regional or general anaesthesia
• A routine posterior vaginal incision is made and extended to the top of the vagina
• Using sharp dissection, the vagina is freed from the underlying rectovaginal fascia and rectum until the pelvic floor (puborectalis)
muscle is seen
• Using sharp and blunt dissection, the sacrospinous ligament running from the ischial spine to the sacral bone is palpated and
identified
• Two sutures are placed through the strong ligament and secured to the top of the vagina. This results in increased support to the
upper vagina. There is no shortening of the vagina
• Other fascial defects in the vagina are repaired, and the vaginal skin is closed
Anterior vaginal repair (colporrhaphy)
Indication
• Prolapse of the bladder or urethra
• Sometimes used to treat urinary stress incontinence
Surgical technique
• The procedure can be performed under regional or general anaesthesia
• The vagina overlying the bladder and urethra is incised in the midline
• Dissection in a plane directly below the vagina allows the damaged fascia supporting the bladder and urethra to be exposed
135
Transvaginal mesh or grafts compared with native tissue repair for vaginal prolapse (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 • The fascia is plicated in the midline using delayed absorbable or permanent sutures
• Sometimes excessive vaginal skin is removed
• The vaginal skin is then closed
• Other sites of prolapse are then repaired as required
Posterior vaginal repair and perineoplasty
Indications
Treatment of rectocele (rectum bulges or herniates forward into the vagina) and defects of the perineum (area separating entrance of
the vagina and anus)
Aim
correct defects in the rectovaginal fascia separating rectum and vagina while allowing bowel function to be maintained or corrected
without interfering with sexual function
Surgical technique
• An incision is made on the posterior wall of the vagina starting at the entrance and finishing at the top of the vagina
• Dissecting the vagina and rectovaginal fascia from the vagina until the pelvic floor muscles (puborectalis) are located
• Defects in the fascia are corrected by centrally plicating the fascia using delayed absorption sutures
• The perineal defects are repaired by placing deep sutures into the perineal muscles to build up the perineal body
• The overlying vaginal and vulval skin is then closed
• A pack is usually placed into the vagina and a catheter into the bladder at the end of surgery
Anterior or posterior vaginal repair, or both (colporrhaphy)
Indications:
Anterior repair: treatment for prolapse of bladder (bladder bulges forward into the vagina; cystocele) or urethra.
Posterior repair: correction of bowel prolapse (rectum bulges forward into the vagina; rectocele).
Vault repair: treat prolapse of upper vagina.
Depending on the side of the defect, the repair can either be anterior, posterior, vault, or total. The repair is achieved by the placement
of permanent mesh, which may result in a stronger repair.
Surgical technique
The procedure can be performed under regional or general anaesthesia.
Anterior vaginal repair
• Midline incision to the vagina overlying the bladder and urethra
• Dissection in a plane directly below the vagina and lateral of the bladder allows the damaged fascia supporting the bladder to be
exposed
• The fascia is plicated in the midline using sutures
• Mesh can be used to reinforce the repair and can be used as an inlay or anchored through the obturator foramen and exiting
through small incisions at both sides of the upper inner thigh
• The vaginal skin is closed
Posterior and vault repair
• An incision is made to the posterior wall of the vagina
• Dissection below the vagina identifies the rectovaginal fascia and opens the space between the rectum and the pelvic floor muscle
to the sacrospinous ligaments
• Defects in the fascia are corrected by centrally plicating the fascia using sutures
• Mesh can be used to reinforce the repair and can be used as an inlay or anchored bilaterally to the pelvic side wall and exiting
through a small incision approximately 3 cm lateral and down from the anus
• The vaginal skin is then closed
Vaginal paravaginal repair
Aim
The objective of this surgery is to reattach detached lateral vaginal fascia to its normal point of insertion on the lateral side wall. This
firm area of attachment is termed the white line or arcus tendineus fascia pelvis.
Indication
The repair of anterior wall prolapse due to defects of the lateral supporting tissues

 The procedure can be performed under regional or general anaesthesia.
Routine anterior repair
The sharp dissection of the vagina from the bladder fascia continues laterally until the pelvic side wall can be identified.
Permanent or delayed absorbable sutures are placed from the lateral vagina to the firm pelvic side wall tissue (white line or arcus
tendineus fascia pelvis). Three to four sutures are placed on each side.
A routine anterior repair with midline plication of the fascia, trimming of excess vaginal skin as required, and closure of the vaginal
skin.

A comparison of transvaginal grafts versus native tis-
sue repairs was formerly part of the 2013 Cochrane
review “Surgical management of pelvic organ prolapse
in women”. We now present this as a separate re-
view. Twelve new trials are included that were not
in the previous review: Dahlgren 2011, da Silviera
2014, Delroy 2013, De Tayrac 2013, Gupta 2014,
Qatawneh 2013, Robert 2014, Rudnicki 2014, Sung
2012, Svabik 2014, Tamanini 2014, Turgal 2013, and
we also include a three-year follow-up of Iglesia 2010.

vide robust evidence to support current and new prac-
tice (such as whether to perform a concurrent conti-

All review authors contributed to writing the protocol. Four review authors (C Maher, C Schmid, B Feiner, K Baessler) assessed the
relevance and eligibility of studies for inclusion in the review and then assessed the quality of included studies. Four review authors (C
Maher, C Schmid, K Baessler, B Feiner) independently extracted data from trial reports, interpreted the results, and contributed to the
writing of the draft version of the review.

This review is the result of updating the review ’Surgical management of pelvic organ prolapse in women’. As a result of the update, we
decided to split the review into six reviews.
This review should be read as part of a series of six Cochrane reviews relating to the surgical management of prolapse including:
1. Surgery for women with anterior compartment prolapse.
2. Surgery for women with posterior compartment prolapse.
3. Surgery for women with apical compartment prolapse.
4. Continence outcomes in pelvic organ prolapse surgery.
5. Transvaginal grafts or mesh compared with native tissue repair for vaginal prolapse.
6. Perioperative interventions at prolapse surgery.
Differences from the published review methods were a reduction in the number of outcomes and limiting this review to studies that
compared native tissue with mesh (absorbable and permanent) and biological grafts.
