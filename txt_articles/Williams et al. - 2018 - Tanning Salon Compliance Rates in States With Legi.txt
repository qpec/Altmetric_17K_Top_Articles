 Tanning Salon Compliance Rates in States With Legislation
to Protect Youth Access to UV Tanning
Melissa S. Williams, MD; Brittany Buhalog, MD; Laura Blumenthal, MD; Erik J. Stratman, MD
IMPORTANCE The US Food and Drug Administration has classified tanning beds as
carcinogenic. Most states have enacted legislation to prevent or create barriers for minors
accessing tanning establishments. Determining tanning salon compliance with legislation
would provide an indication of the influence of legislation at preventing exposure to the
carcinogen in minors.
OBJECTIVES To investigate compliance rates in the 42 states and the District of Columbia with
legislation restricting tanning bed use in minors and to identify differences in compliance
based on population, regional location, salon ownership, age group being regulated, and time
since the law was enacted.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This investigation was a cross-sectional telephone
survey conducted between February 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016, by callers posing as minors
attempting to schedule a tanning appointment. The setting was tanning salons in the 42
states and the District of Columbia that currently have legislation restricting tanning bed use
in minors. Included in the study were 427 tanning salons, 10 randomly selected from each
state or territory with tanning legislation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall compliance of tanning salons with state tanning
legislation and differences in compliance based on community population, regional location,
independent vs chain tanning salon, age group being regulated, and time since the law was
enacted.
RESULTS Of the 427 tanning salons surveyed, overall noncompliance with state legislation
was 37.2% (n = 159). There were more noncompliant tanning salons in rural locations (45.5%;
95% CI, 37.5%-53.7%; P = .009), southern regions of the United States (49.4%; 95% CI,
41.4%-57.4%; P = .001), independently owned salons (43.9%; 95% CI, 37.3%-50.6%;
P = .003), states with younger age groups being regulated (53.5%; 95% CI, 45.7%-61.2%;
P < .001), and states with more than one tanning regulation (50.0%; 95% CI, 42.0%-58.0%;
P < .001). No difference was found based on time since the law was enacted.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Compliance with state legislation aimed at limiting tanning
bed use among US minors is unsatisfactory, indicating that additional efforts to enforce the
laws and education of the harmful effects of UV tanning are necessary, especially in rural,
independently owned, and tanning salons in southern regions, which have decreased
compliance rates.

t is estimated that banning indoor tanning for minors
youngerthan18yearswouldprevent61 839melanomasand
6735 melanoma deaths and save $342.9 million in treat-
ment costs.1 The World Health Organization2 supports a ban
on indoor tanning for anyone younger than 18 years. While a
federal indoor tanning ban does not yet exist, the US Food and
Drug Administration3 has required labeling on indoor tan-
ning devices and promotional materials, stating that they
should not be used by anyone younger than 18 years. There
have been 42 states and the District of Columbia that passed
legislation limiting the use of indoor tanning devices for
minors,4 yet almost 1.9 million high school students in the
United States are still engaging in indoor tanning.5
Several studies have assessed tanning salon compliance
with state legislation; however, most studies assessed com-
pliance in single states,6,7 a few states,8 or only large cities.9
To our knowledge, no studies have assessed compliance in ru-
ral locations, by region of the country, or comparing indepen-
dent tanning facilities vs large chain operations. Our objec-
tive was to investigate whether tanning facilities in states with
legislation effectively restrict youth access to indoor tanning
and whether differences in compliance exist in rural vs urban
locations, by region in the United States, between indepen-
dent vs chain tanning salons, based on age group being regu-
lated, or based on time frame when the law was enacted.
Methods
This investigation was a cross-sectional telephone survey in
which 3 of us (M.S.W., B.B., and L.B.) made telephone calls to
10 tanning facilities in each of the 42 states and District of Co-
lumbia (n = 427) with tanning legislation for minors ran-
domly selected by zip code. The study was approved by the
Marshfield Clinic Institutional Review Board.
All zip codes for each state or territory were collected and
randomized from a website (http://www.unitedstateszipcodes
.org). For the first 10 randomly selected zip codes, a search was
performed online (http://www.yellowpages.com) for tanning
salon and that zip code. If multiple tanning salons were
identified, a list was generated, and one tanning salon was
randomly selected. If a given zip code did not have a tanning
salon, the next randomized zip code result was used. If a given
tanning salon had a nonworking telephone number or was
unreachable after 5 attempts, a different randomized tanning
salon was chosen for that zip code.
Data collection was completed by 3 of us (M.S.W., B.B., and
L.B.) between February 1, 2015, and April 30, 2016. Each data
collector posed as a minor who was 1 year younger than the
stated regulation for that state.4 Figure 1 shows the regula-
tions for each state,10 with more detailed descriptions listed
in Table 1 according to the state-by-state comparison by the
National Conference of State Legislatures.4 In the 16 states
where more than one age-related legislation was present, such
as a ban at one age and parental consent required at another
age, the data collector assessed the younger age restriction.
A telephone script was followed whereby the investigator
stated that she desired to get a tan before leaving for an up-
comingfamilyvacation.Thetanningemployeewasthenasked
about session costs and whether a parent needed to be present
to consent for the tanning session. The full telephone script
is shown in the eFigure in the Supplement. The employee’
s re-
sponse of whether the data collector was allowed to tan was
recorded in a spreadsheet (Excel; Microsoft Corp). If the sa-
lon was noncompliant with the state legislation, the reason for
noncompliance was also recorded.
The population of the city or village for each zip code was
obtained using 2010 US census data. Populations less than
15 000 were considered rural. A tanning facility was classi-
fied as independent if only one location was listed on the tan-
ning facility’
s website and it was the only business listed when
the facility name and state were typed into a Google search.
Each state or territory was categorized into a specific region
of the United States based on the US census definition of US
regions.11 Finally, each state or territory was categorized into
those with legislation enacted between 2014 and 2016 and
those with legislation enacted before 2014.

Key Points
Question How compliant are the tanning salons in 42 states and
the District of Columbia with current indoor tanning legislation?
Findings In this cross-sectional telephone survey of 427 tanning
salons in 42 states and the District of Columbia, 159 tanning salons
were out of compliance with state legislation. Statistically
significant decreases in compliance were found for rural,
independently owned, and southern US tanning salons.
Meaning Tanning salon compliance with state laws restricting
access to minors is unsatisfactory, and monitoring and
enforcement efforts are needed to ensure compliance with these
laws that are intended to minimize the harmful effects of UV
tanning in minors.

 Statistical analyses were carried out using a statistical soft-
ware package (SAS, version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc). χ2 Test or
Fisher exact test was used to compare the difference in com-
pliance rates separately for population (<15 000 vs ≥15 000),
regional location (West, Midwest, South, or Northeast), inde-
pendent vs chain tanning salon, age group being regulated (≤15
vs ≥16 years), and time frame of legislation (before 2014 vs
2014-2016). Each of the above-mentioned statistical tests gen-
erated a 2-sided P value, and P < .05 represented a statisti-
cally significant difference in compliance rates.
Results
A total of 427 tanning facilities were contacted in 42 states and
the District of Columbia. Only a total of 7 UV tanning facilities
were found in Hawaii. The characteristics of the tanning salons
contactedarelistedinTable2.Overallnoncompliancewithstate
tanninglegislationwas37.2%(159of427),andthemostcommon
reason for being coded as noncompliant was allowing tanning

 compared with any other region (30.0% [80 of 267]) (P = .001).
There were more noncompliant tanning salons among inde-
pendently owned tanning salons (43.9% [100 of 228]) com-
pared with chain tanning salons (29.6% [59 of 199]) (P = .003).
There were more noncompliant tanning salons in states or ter-
ritories with laws governing younger minors (15 years and
younger) (53.5% [91 of 170]) compared with those governing
older minors (16 years and older) (26.5% [68 of 257]) (P < .001).
There were more noncompliant tanning salons in states with
more than one tanning regulation (50.0% [80 of 160]) com-
pared with states with only one tanning regulation (29.6% [79
of 267]) (P < .001). States that banned all minors had better
compliance than states with any other type of tanning legis-
lation (78.1% [107 of 137] vs 55.5% [161 of 290], P < .001). Fi-
nally, the noncompliance of states that had more recent tan-
ning legislation did not perform differently than those with
longer-standing tanning legislation (38.8% [57 of 147] vs 36.4%
[102 of 280], P = .67).
Discussion
Tanning legislation is enacted to protect the public from can-
cer risk. This study assessed tanning salon compliance with
state legislation in all 42 states and the District of Columbia
that had legislation restricting tanning bed use in minors at the
time of study completion. The study looked specifically at dif-
ferences in compliance by community population, region of
the United States, type of business (independent vs chain tan-
ning salon), age group being regulated, the time elapsed since
legislation was passed, and states with only one vs more than
onetanningregulation.Ourstudysuggeststhatmorethanone-
third of tanning salons are noncompliant with legislation. Im-
proved enforcement of tanning legislation is critical to de-
creasing the risks of skin cancer. In reviewing each state’
s laws,
most were silent on monitoring and enforcement. When men-
tioned (19 of 43), monitoring and enforcement was most of-
tenaresponsibilitygiventolocalhealthdepartments(14of19).
However, in one study12 looking at tanning law enforcement
of22metropolitancommunities,approximately32%ofthecity
health departments assigned to monitor compliance did not
inspect tanning facilities, and another 32% conducted inspec-
tions less than annually. Of the 43 states with tanning bans,
only 20 laws mention specific fines, ranging from $50 up to
$25 000 (most were in the $250-$1000 range). Eight laws state
that failure to comply is a misdemeanor, and 5 state that the

 salon’
s license or permit can be revoked or temporarily sus-
pended. Still, even when violations were found, at least in one
study12 less than 50% of violators were penalized.
If each state was given a letter grade for performance (with
A, ≥90% compliance; B, 80%-89% compliance; C, 70%-79%
compliance; D, 60%-69% compliance; and F, <60% compli-
ance), only 13 of 43 (30.2%) states or territories would make
the A/B honor roll for compliance (Figure 2). Those states with
only one type of tanning legislation performed better than
those with at least 2 types of legislation. Remembering de-
tails of multiple tanning laws is perhaps difficult for tanning
salon employees. A federal ban on tanning for anyone younger
than 18 years might be easier for employees to remember and
enforce. Furthermore, those states having tanning bans for mi-
nors younger than 18 years were significantly more compli-
antwithlegislationcomparedwithstateshavinganyothertype
of tanning legislation. The only 3 states with 100% compli-
ance (New Hampshire, Oregon, and Illinois) all have tanning
bans for anyone younger than 18 years.
Becauserural,southern,andindependentlyownedUStan-
ning salons were less compliant with state legislation, further
targeted assessment of compliance with the law and public
education may be necessary. It is unlikely that the education
will come from the tanning industry. A previous study6 found
that 61% of California tanning salons surveyed denied the dan-
gers of UV tanning, and up to 17% claimed that indoor tan-
ningwashelpfulbypreventingfuturesunburns.Parentsshould
also be better educated on the harmful effects of UV radia-
tion because parental influence is one of the main factors lead-
ing to underage tanning.13,14
Limitations
Ourstudyhasseverallimitations.Theseencounterswerescripted
telephonecallsinsteadofin-personencounters.Itispossiblethat
compliance rates would have been different with in-person en-
counterswithactualminors.However,accordingtoa2006study
by Hurd et al,15 concordance between telephone-based indoor
tanning compliance and face-to-face compliance was compa-
rable.Itisalsopossiblethattheemployeetriagingthetelephone
calls was not the final step in the vetting process and that addi-
tional screening processes more in compliance with the law
wouldhavebeenperformedwhenascheduledminorarrivedfor
tanning.Includedinthecategoryofsalonsoutofcompliancewith
the law were salons that banned tanning at an allowable age.
From a dermatologist’
s perspective, this might be considered a
good form of noncompliance. These salons perhaps wanted to
upholdasaferstandardthanthelawallows,whichshouldbeen-
couraged.AlthoughouroverallsamplesizeforassessingUStan-
ning compliance was good (n = 427), another limitation is our
small sample size per state or territory (n = 10). However, when
comparing our individual state compliance rates vs those pre-
viously reported in other studies, compliance rates were com-
parableforWisconsin8 (80%vs77%),Texas7 (80%vs81%),and
California6 (90% vs 77%).
Further studies are needed to assess compliance of all
stateswithstateregulations,includingwhetherincreasedcom-
pliance correlates with decreased skin cancer incidence over
time. A reliable method for monitoring and enforcing state leg-
islation is also needed.
Conclusions
While most states in the United States have passed legisla-
tion regarding youth access to indoor tanning, our study
demonstrates that tanning salon compliance with legislation
remains a problem. The best compliance with the law was
found in states with tanning bans for all minors. Rural loca-
tions, the southern United States, and independently owned
tanning salons have the lowest rates of compliance, high-
lighting the need for more education and better law enforce-
ment regarding state legislation and the harmful effects of
UV indoor tanning.

therefore, compliance was not assessed.

NOTABLE NOTES
A Memorable Touch
Ajay Kailas, BS; Leonard J. Hoenig, MD
A touch is a simple act people perform countless times each day.
Yet a touch may leave behind a lasting impression, a sentiment
captured by the beloved English poet John Keats (1795-1821) in his
romantic poem To— (What Can I Do To Drive Away)1:
Touch has a memory. O say, love, say,
What can I do to kill it and be free…?
A touch can also leave behind our identity, in the form of a fingerprint, a
factwellknowntoforensicscience.Formorethanacentury,fingerprint
analysis has been a mainstay of crime scene investigation, helping to
identifybothcriminalsandtheirvictims.However,technologicaladvances
overthepast20yearshaveintroducedanewforensictoolcalled“touch
DNA” that has greatly expanded the evidence that can be gleaned from
asimpletouch.2TouchDNAhasreceivedmuchpublicitythroughitsuse
inhigh-profilecriminalcasesandbyitsdramaticportrayalontelevision.
Touch DNA is based on the observation that when an object is
touched, a person’
s skin cells can be shed and transferred to the
contacted surface. It requires a miniscule sample—as little as 7 to 8 skin
cells for proper analysis. These skin cells are collected as evidence;
then DNA is extracted and amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The
resulting DNA sample is then profiled and interpreted.
The DNA profiling, as practiced by the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion, uses 20 core loci of short repeated sequences of DNA called STRs
(short tandem repeats). The number of repeated sequences at each
locuscanvaryfrompersontoperson.Takentogether,the20STRlociform
auniqueDNAprofileforagivenindividual.DNAevidenceobtainedfrom
a crime scene is then entered into the FBI’
s DNA databases called
CODIS (Combined DNA Index System) to see if it matches with
1 of more than 14 million DNA profiles on file.
One criminal case that featured touch DNA was the 1987 homicide
of Peggy Hettrick.2 Timothy Lee Masters was convicted of the crime
in 1999 and sentenced to life imprisonment. However, his sentence
was vacated in 2008 when touch DNA evidence obtained from
clothesofthevictimimplicatedanothersuspect,thusexoneratinghim.
Touch DNA accuracy can be limited by DNA contamination from
sources outside the crime scene. Thus, Lukis Anderson was wrongly
charged with the 2012 murder of Raveesh Kumra when paramedics,
who had earlier treated Anderson, accidentally transferred his skin
cells to the victim.3
Poets will continue to celebrate the mysterious beauty of the
human touch. Forensic science will continue its comprehensive efforts
to obtain evidence left behind by a touch, to better solve crimes and
bring justice to its victims.
