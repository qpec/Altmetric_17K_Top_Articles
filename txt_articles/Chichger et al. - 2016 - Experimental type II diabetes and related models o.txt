New Findings
r What is the central question of this study?
Although SGLT2 inhibitors represent a promising treatment for patients suffering from
diabetic nephropathy, the influence of metabolic disruption on the expression and function
of glucose transporters is largely unknown.
r What is the main finding and its importance?
In vivo models of metabolic disruption (Goto–Kakizaki type II diabetic rat and junk-food
diet) demonstrate increased expression of SGLT1, SGLT2 and GLUT2 in the proximal tubule
brush border. In the type II diabetic model, this is accompanied by increased SGLT- and
GLUT-mediated glucose uptake. A fasted model of metabolic disruption (high-fat diet)
demonstrated increased GLUT2 expression only. The differential alterations of glucose
transporters in response to varying metabolic stress offer insight into the therapeutic value
of inhibitors.
SGLT2 inhibitors are now in clinical use to reduce hyperglycaemia in type II diabetes. However,
renal glucose reabsorption across the brush border membrane (BBM) is not completely
understood in diabetes. Increased consumption of a Western diet is strongly linked to
type II diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the adaptations that occur in renal glucose
transporters in response to experimental models of diet-induced insulin resistance. The study
used Goto–Kakizaki type II diabetic rats and normal rats rendered insulin resistant using
junk-food or high-fat diets. Levels of protein kinase C-βI (PKC-βI), GLUT2, SGLT1 and SGLT2
were determined by Western blotting of purified renal BBM. GLUT- and SGLT-mediated

Introduction
Diabetic nephropathy is a major complication of diabetes
and a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Chronic
hyperglycaemia is associated with tubulo-interstitial
changes that accompany progressive renal dysfunction.
Although
it
has
been
difficult
to
show
a
clear
cardiovascular benefit from tighter glycaemic control in
diabetes, at least in the short term (Boot-Handford &
Heath, 1981; Phillips et al. 1997), available evidence
favours a long-term reduction in hyperglycaemia as an
important treatment goal in preventing nephropathy
(Dluhy & McMahon, 2008; Duckworth et al. 2009). Thus,
renal glucose reabsorption has been considered to have
a pathophysiological role in diabetes (Debnam & Unwin,
1996).
In euglycaemic conditions, the majority of filtered
glucose is reabsorbed by the high-capacity transporter
SGLT2 at the brush border membrane (BBM) of the
early proximal convoluted tubule, while the remainder
is scavenged by the high-affinity transporter SGLT1 in
the late proximal straight tubule (Turner & Silverman,
1977; Barfuss & Schafer, 1981; Cramer et al. 1992; Brown,
2000). Adaptation of glucose transport at the BBM has
been documented in diabetes; in particular, the facilitated
transporter, GLUT2, is readily detectable at the BBM
in animals 2–4 weeks after induction of type I diabetes
(Marks et al. 2003). Indeed, expression of GLUT2 shows a
positive correlation with blood glucose concentrations,
and it has been proposed that increased renal GLUT2
expression at the BBM is mediated by protein kinase C-βI
(PKC-βI), because concentrations of this signalling
molecule also show a positive correlation with both the
expression of GLUT2 and blood glucose concentrations
(Goestemeyer et al. 2007). Although there are conflicting
reports on the impact of diabetes on SGLT-mediated
transport (Marks et al. 2003; Albertoni Borghese et al.
2009), inhibitors of SGLT2 have been demonstrated
to increase glycosuria and reduce hyperglycaemia in
type II diabetes (Han et al. 2008). Indeed, dapagliflozin,
canaglifozin and empaglifozin, chemical inhibitors of
this kidney-specific glucose transporter, have all been
approved for use in Europe as insulin-independent
treatments for type II diabetes. However, the glucose
transporters SGLT1 and GLUT2 also play a role in
glucose reabsorption across the proximal tubule brush
border (Marks et al. 2003; Hummel et al. 2011) and
might represent additional targets for the control of
hyperglycaemia in diabetes. Consistent with this, studies
in euglycaemic conditions indicate that SGLT1-mediated
renal glucose transport increases to compensate for SGLT2
knockdown (Rieg et al. 2014). Thus, the role of glucose
transporters at the proximal tubule BBM in diabetes
requires further study.
Western diets have changed dramatically over the last
30 years, with a significant increase in consumption
of calorie-dense processed foods. There is a general
consensus
that
the
rising
prevalence
of
obesity,
type II diabetes and its essential prerequisite, insulin
resistance, is related to consumption of these processed
and calorie-dense foods, rich in saturated fat and
carbohydrates with a high glycaemic index (Bayol et al.
2005; Fulgoni, 2008). Diet-induced obesity is a major
risk factor for development of the metabolic syndrome,
a disorder characterized by impaired glucose tolerance,
hyperuricaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and hypertension,
and which is considered to be prediabetic (Aguilar-Salinas
et al. 2005; Junien & Nathanielsz, 2007; AlSaraj et al. 2009).
Increased consumption of saturated and trans-saturated
fats and carbohydrates has also been shown to have an
adverse effect on glucose metabolism and induce insulin
resistance (Moeller et al. 2009). Consumption of artificial
sweeteners, such as sucralose and saccharin, has also
increased significantly in recent years (Mattes & Popkin,
2009; Yang, 2010). Interestingly, both experimental studies
and meta-analyses have linked the consumption of
artificial sweeteners with the development of glucose
intolerance (Pepino et al. 2013; Suez et al. 2014).
Therefore, the Western diet is likely to contribute
to the development of insulin resistance and type II
diabetes through disturbances in glucose homeostasis
that are determined mainly by the composition of
the diet.
Given that the kidneys play a major role in glucose
homeostasis, the aim of the present study was to
characterize glucose transport at the proximal tubule
BBM in experimental models associated with metabolic
disturbance. Models of early type I diabetes, type II
diabetes, diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance
and exposure to artificial sweetener were used. Studies

GLUT2, SGLT1 and SGLT2 in diabetes-related disease
on type II diabetes used Goto–Kakizaki (GK) rats,
an established non-obese model of the condition
characterized by glucose intolerance and impaired insulin
secretion (Goto et al. 1976). Given that type II diabetes
in man has been attributed to the high consumption of
‘junk foods’ in the Western diet (Hu et al. 2001), an
earlier stage in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes was
studied using rats maintained on either a cafeteria diet
composed of processed foods or a defined high-fat diet.
Finally, animals acutely exposed to the artificial sweetener
saccharin were compared. Our studies demonstrate a
differential expression profile of glucose transporters
at the BBM in response to these various forms/stages
of metabolic disease. We propose that specific glucose
transporters could be targeted at the proximal tubule BBM
to attenuate glucose reabsorption and potentially lessen
hyperglycaemia in diabetes or prediabetes and might even
provide eventual renoprotection.
Methods
Ethical approval
All procedures were carried out in accordance with
the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986
AmendmentRegulations2012.Theprotocolwasapproved
by the University College London (Royal Free Campus)
Comparative Biology Unit Animal Welfare and Ethical
Review Body (AWERB) committee.
Animal models
Type I diabetes was induced by a single tail vein
injection of streptozotocin (55 mg kg−1) administered
to male Sprague–Dawley rats (200–230 g) 7 days prior
to experimentation. This protocol was chosen because
hyperglycaemia of at least 7 days’ duration is required
for detection of increased GLUT2 expression at the BBM
(data not shown). Streptozotocin was freshly prepared in
0.05 M citrate buffer and administered under light inhaled
isofluorane anaesthesia (2% isofluorane in 100% oxygen,
non-terminal). Control animals received an injection
of citrate buffer. Type II diabetes was studied in 8-
to 9-week-old non-obese GK rats (Goto et al. 1976),
purchased from Charles River, USA, and compared with
Wistar control animals.
Type I and type II diabetic animals were allowed ad
libitum access to a standard rat chow (diet RM1; SDS Ltd,
Witham, UK) and water. For ‘junk-food’ (‘cafeteria diet’)
feeding studies, male Wistar rats were allowed ad libitium
access to water and either a standard rat maintenance
diet (Diet RM3; SDS Ltd) or chow supplemented with
junk food over an 8-week period (Rothwell & Stock, 1979;
Bayol et al. 2005). The junk-food diet consisted of a choice
of palatable, processed foods with high fat and/or high
sugar content, including potato crisps (5.7% of consumed
food), flapjacks (12.3% of consumed food), cheese (4.9%
of consumed food), marshmallows (6.9% of consumed
food), muffins (12.1% of consumed food), doughnut
(19.8% of consumed food), biscuits (31.1% of consumed
food) and chocolate bars (7.2% of consumed food). Daily
energy consumption for chow-fed and junk-food-fed
animals was 17.5 kcal (73.2 kJ) and 198 kcal (830.6 kJ),
respectively. For the high-fat diet model, male Wistar rats
(125–150 g) were purchased from Charles River (UK)
and had ad libitum access to a 60% fat-as-calories chow
(R12492; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) over a
5-week period or maintenance diet. Rats maintained on a
high-fat diet were fasted overnight prior to being killed by
exposuretoagraduallyincreasingconcentrationofcarbon
dioxide. At the end of the diabetic or junk-food feeding
protocols, unfasted animals were terminally anaesthetized
with an I.P. injection of pentobarbital sodium (60 mg kg−1;
Pentoject; Animalcare Ltd, York, UK). Monitoring of the
pedal and corneal reflex was undertaken to ensure that
deep anaesthesia was achieved before blood was obtained
by cardiac puncture and the kidneys removed. Death
after exsanguination was ensured by incising the heart.
Renal cortical fragments were dissected at 4°C and either
snap-frozen for BBM preparation for Western blotting
studies or BBM vesicles were freshly prepared for glucose
uptake studies.
The plasma glucose concentration was measured using
the glucose oxidase assay (Huggett & Nixon, 1957),
and plasma insulin was quantified using a sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Millipore,
UK).
Animal procedures: infusion studies
For
infusion
experiments,
8-
to
9-week-old
male
Sprague–Dawley rats, allowed ad libitum access to
RM1 diet were anaesthetized with an I.P. injection of
pentobarbital sodium (60 mg kg−1) and the jugular vein
and bladder were cannulated. Test animals were infused
with 154 mM NaCl at 5.5 ml h−1 for 1 h, followed by 1 mM
saccharin in 154 mM NaCl for a further 2 h, while control
animals continued to receive 154 mM NaCl. At the end
of the infusion protocol, blood was collected by cardiac
puncture and the kidneys removed. Cortical fragments
were dissected at 4°C and BBM vesicles immediately
prepared for studies of glucose uptake.
Preparation of renal BBM and glucose uptake studies
Brush border membrane vesicles were prepared from
kidney cortex, using a double Mg2+ chelation protocol,
as described previously (Marks et al. 2003). The purity

of the BBM preparation was confirmed by six- to
eight-fold enrichment of alkaline phosphatase. The
protein concentration was determined using a Bradford
assay (Bradford, 1976). Uptake studies were carried
out as described previously (Marks et al. 2003). In
brief, the transport process was initiated by mixing
equal volumes of vesicle suspension and uptake buffer
consisting of (mM): 200 NaSCN, 20 Hepes and 0.1
MgSO4, containing D-[3H]glucose such that the final
concentration of glucose was 30–960 μM, to determine the
transport kinetics of SGLT-mediated glucose transport.
Uptake was terminated after 4 s by the addition of 3 ml of
154 mM NaCl containing 0.5 mM phlorizin, followed by
vacuum filtration through 0.45 μm nitrocellulose filters
(Millipore UK, Watford, UK). Three further washes were
carried out. In order to assess GLUT-mediated transport,
a higher glucose concentration (20 mM) was used in
the presence of 1 mM phlorizin; this value is consistent
with the low affinity of GLUT transporters for glucose
binding(Debnam&Unwin,1996).Thekineticparameters
of Vmax (maximal transport capacity) and Kt (glucose
concentration at half Vmax) for phlorizin-sensitive uptake
were derived using Lineweaver–Burk plot analysis of
uptake data obtained using glucose concentrations in the
micromolar range.
Western blotting
Western blotting of the BBM was carried out as previously
described (Marks et al. 2003) using rabbit polyclonal
antibodies raised against SGLT1 (a gift from Professor
G. Kellett, University of York, UK), SGLT2 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), GLUT2
(AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK) and PKC-βI (Santa
Cruz). Mouse monoclonal antibody for β-actin (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) was used as a loading control. Blots
were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence on a
Fluor-SMultiImagersystem(Bio-Rad,HemelHempstead,
UK), and the abundance of each protein of interest was
calculated relative to β-actin and expressed as a percentage
of the control average.

Results
Type II diabetes increases SGLT- and GLUT-mediated
transport of glucose across the BBM
Long-term type I diabetes increases glucose transport
across the proximal tubule BBM through enhanced
levels of GLUT2 (Marks et al. 2003). Our first aim
was to assess the effect of experimental type II diabetes
on renal glucose transport. In keeping with previously
published observations (Noll et al. 2011), at 8–9 weeks
of age the GK rats weighed significantly less than
control Wistar rats and had an increased plasma
glucose concentration (Table 1) and glycosuria (data
not shown); however, the increase in plasma insulin
concentrations in GK rats did not reach significance
(Table 1).
Brush border membrane vesicles isolated from the
kidneys of Wistar control rats were enriched in alkaline
phosphatase (6.26 ± 1.04-fold, n = 6), and type II
diabetes had no significant effect on these values (6.26 ±
0.68-fold, n = 6). As previously reported, glucose
uptake studies revealed the expected time-dependent
overshoot, which was blocked by phlorizin (data not
shown; Marks et al. 2003). Vesicle-trapped space, as
determined by incubation of BBM vesicles with 100 mM
D-[3H]glucose for 15 min, was unaffected by type II
diabetes [control 2.84 ± 0.66 μl (mg protein)−1 versus
GK 3.60 ± 0.64 μl (mg protein)−1, n = 6]. At increasing
concentrations of glucose, uptake across the BBM was
significantly higher in GK rats compared with control
animals (Fig. 1A). The Vmax for SGLT-mediated glucose
uptake was 66% greater in BBM prepared from kidneys
of type II diabetic rats (control 1426.1 ± 66.3 pmol (mg
protein)−1 versusGK2364.6±433.2pmol(mgprotein)−1,
n = 6–8, P < 0.05), and Kt increased by 80% (control
147.1 ± 21.6 μM versus GK 264.3 ± 46.1 μM, n =
6–8, P < 0.05). Phlorizin-insensitive, GLUT-mediated
glucose transport, measured at 20 mM, was 130%
greater in BBM prepared from type II diabetic animals
(Fig. 1B).
Western blotting revealed higher levels of GLUT2,
SGLT1 and PKC-βI in BBM vesicles prepared from GK
rats (Fig. 2A). As previously demonstrated (Marks et al.
2003; Goestemeyer et al. 2007), exposure to streptozotocin
induced hyperglycaemia (Table 1). Interestingly, while
GLUT2 and PKC-βI expression at the BBM was
significantly increased, SGLT1 and SGLT2 levels were
unaffected 1-week after streptozotocin injection (Fig. 2B).
Therefore, our data demonstrate that renal glucose
transport by SGLT1 and GLUT2 is upregulated at the BBM
in a non-obese, hyperglycaemic model of type II diabetes,
but that there are differences in the adaptation of renal
glucose transport induced in models of type I and type II
diabetes.

Differential expression profile of glucose transporters
at the renal BBM in rodent models of diet-induced
obesity and insulin resistance
We next sought to examine whether diet-induced
models of obesity and insulin resistance affect glucose
transporter expression at the renal BBM using two
well-characterized models of diet-induced obesity (Bayol
et al. 2005; Anderson et al. 2009). Both cafeteria diet-
and high-fat diet-fed rats gained significantly more body
weight and displayed elevated plasma glucose and insulin
concentrations compared with their chow-fed control
groups (Table 1). Western blotting of BBM prepared
from rats maintained on both the junk-food and high-fat
diet revealed significantly higher GLUT2 levels compared
with chow-fed animals, which was accompanied by
increased levels of PKC-βI (Fig. 2C and D, respectively).
Interestingly, BBM protein levels of SGLT1 and 2 were
significantly increased in animals fed the junk-food, but
not high-fat, diet (Fig. 2C and D, respectively). These
data demonstrate that expression of glucose transporters
at the proximal tubule BBM is dependent on the model
of diet-induced obesity used and is not regulated solely by
glycaemia or insulinaemia.
The artificial sweetener saccharin regulates
SGLT-mediated glucose transport at the renal BBM
Activation of sweet taste receptors, localized to the small
intestine, has been proposed to regulate intestinal glucose
transporter expression (Mace et al. 2007, 2009). Given the
similarity in renal glucose handling in the intestine and
kidney, we wanted to establish whether short-term I.V.
infusion of the artificial sweetener saccharin influenced
renal glucose transport. A 2 h infusion of 1 mM saccharin
had no effect on plasma glucose concentration (Table 1).
As expected, BBM vesicles isolated from the kidneys
of saline-infused rats and saccharin-infused rats were
enriched in alkaline phosphatase (6.81 ± 0.61-fold,
n = 6 and 6.64 ± 0.57-fold, n = 6, respectively), and
vesicle-trapped space was also unaffected by saccharin
[saline 1.49 ± 0.24 μl (mg protein)−1 versus saccharin
1.44 ± 0.21 μl (mg protein)−1, n = 6]. The Vmax for
SGLT-mediated glucose uptake was 143% greater in the
renal BBM of saccharin-infused rats [control 959.4 ±
90.5 pmol (mg protein)−1 versus saccharin 2333 ±
447 pmol (mg protein)−1, n = 5, P < 0.05], whilst the Kt
was unaffected (control 947.4 ± 120.9 μM versus saccharin
1282.4±329μM,n=5;Fig.3A).Westernblottingrevealed
that expression of SGLT1, but not SGLT2, was significantly
increased at the proximal tubule BBM (Fig. 4). Renal
GLUT-mediatedglucosetransport,measuredusing20mM
glucose, was unaffected by saccharin infusion (Fig. 3B)
and, in keeping with this finding, protein levels of GLUT2
and its upstream regulator PKC-βI were also unchanged
(Fig. 4).
To establish whether sweet taste receptors might
mediate the effect of saccharin on SGLT1-dependent
glucose transport, we next studied the mRNA expression
of sweet taste receptors in the rat kidney. Using RNA from
rat small intestine as a positive control, qPCR revealed
that T1R2, T1R3 and their downstream G-protein,
α-gustducin, were not expressed in the rat kidney (data
not shown). This finding is in keeping with RNA-seq data
published by Lee et al. (2015b), who, using microdissected
tubular segments, were unable to demonstrate expression
of these receptors in any part of the mouse kidney. In
conflict with these RNA data, the antibodies (purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used by Mace et al. (2007,
2009) to investigate the effect of saccharin on intestinal
taste receptor expression were able to detect a strong
signal in renal BBM vesicles. However, the use of these
antibodies in immunohistochemistry demonstrated that
there was a high degree of non-specific binding, with no
particular region of the kidney showing positive staining.
Taken together, our findings suggest a role for saccharin

in enhancing renal BBM glucose transport through
SGLT1, which, unlike the situation in the small intestine,
appears to be independent of the sweet taste receptor
T1R2/3.
Discussion
Diabetic nephropathy is an important late complication
of diabetes, especially when glycaemic status has been
poorly controlled. The use of SGLT2 inhibitors is a new
treatment modality for maintaining glycaemic control in
patients with type II diabetes, and although it has been
suggested that this approach may also limit the long-term
renal consequences of diabetic nephropathy, to date it has
not been shown to provide unequivocal ‘renoprotection’
other than by improving blood sugar control. Lack of
more direct renoprotection might be a consequence of
adaptationinglucosetransportmechanismsinresponseto
SGLT2 inhibition. For example, it is known that in healthy
volunteers, inhibition of SGLT2 reduces reabsorption of
filtered glucose by only �30–50% (Liu et al. 2012), which
may be attributable to scavenging of the abnormally high
glucose levels reaching the late proximal tubule by SGLT1
(Brown, 2000; Wright, 2001). However, this explanation
is largely based on studies in non-diabetic mice and does
not take account of the potential for additional adaptive

GLUT2, SGLT1 and SGLT2 in diabetes-related disease
changes in renal glucose transport that may occur in
diabetes. In this context, it has also been shown by Vallon
et al. (2013) that although SGLT2 gene knockout reduces
glycaemia in experimental type I diabetes, lack of SGLT2
does not abrogate the effects of diabetes on renal growth
or markers of renal injury, inflammation and fibrosis;
others have made similar findings for SGLT2 inhibition
(O’Neill et al. 2015). Thus, understanding how glucose is
transported across the renal BBM and how the process
is upregulated in diabetes and prediabetes may offer new
insights to enable the reduction of potentially damaging
effects of increased glucose load and transport on tubular
function.
The present study used animal models of diabetes and
models of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance of
differing aetiology to assess the effects of insulin resistance
and hyperglycaemia on expression of glucose transporters
at the renal BBM. Our previous findings have shown
that expression of GLUT2 and its regulator, PKC-βI,
are increased in a model of established type I diabetes
(Marks et al. 2003) and that their expression levels are
correlated with changes in glucose concentration within
the pathophysiological range (Goestemeyer et al. 2007).
In keeping with these findings, we have demonstrated
that expression of GLUT2 and PKC-βI at the renal
BBM is higher in type II diabetes and 1 week after
induction of type I diabetes. However, we also show
increased levels of both GLUT2 and PKC-βI at the BBM in
animals maintained on junk-food and high-fat diets, even
though these animals demonstrated only mild elevations
in plasma glucose. The high renal GLUT2 expression in
the absence of a pronounced glycaemic stimulus suggests
that increased glucose uptake across the BBM can occur
in models of insulin resistance and impaired glucose
tolerance (prediabetes), a state known to precede the onset
of type II diabetes.
Also in agreement with our previous studies using
long-term type I diabetic rats (Marks et al. 2003), we
observed no alteration in SGLT1 or SGLT2 expression at
the renal BBM in response to recent induction of type I
diabetes. However, in the GK model of type II diabetes,
the capacity for SGLT-mediated glucose transport was
augmented, and this was accompanied by an increase
in the level of SGLT1, but not SGLT2, protein. Studies
using exfoliated proximal tubular epithelial cells obtained
from the urine of type II diabetic patients also show

increased SGLT-mediated glucose transport, but this was
attributed to an increase in SGLT2 activity as a result of
enhanced mRNA and protein levels (Rahmoune et al.
2005). In addition, some studies in genetic mouse models
of both type I (Akita mice) and type II diabetes (db/db
mice) also report increased renal SGLT2 expression
and SGLT activity, respectively (Arakawa et al. 2001;
Vallon et al. 2013). However, it is important to note
that numerous studies over the past 30 years have
provided conflicting results on diabetes-induced changes
in sodium-dependent glucose transport and SGLT
transporter expression (Debnam & Unwin, 1996; Poulsen
et al. 2015), with discrepancies being attributed to the
dose of streptozotocin used to induce type I diabetes, the
use of chemical versus genetic models of diabetes, and the
severity of the model being studied. The complexity of
these changes in renal glucose transporter expression is
also highlighted by the differing transporter expression
profiles observed in our junk-food- and high-fat-fed
models. As with GLUT2, renal SGLT1 and SGLT2

GLUT2, SGLT1 and SGLT2 in diabetes-related disease
expression does not follow a clear pattern with respect to
plasma glucose or insulin concentrations. Furthermore,
the differential effects of a junk-food or high-fat diet
on expression of SGLTs and GLUT2 suggest that these
transporters are not regulated by the same factor(s) in
these different dietary models.
At present, the identity of this factor(s) is unknown;
however, given the similarity between the process
of
glucose
transport
across
enterocytes
and
renal
tubular cells, parallels can be drawn over regulation
of glucose transport and the possibility of glucose
‘sensing’ by the kidney. Sweet taste receptors are
transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors formed by
heterodimerization of T1R2 and T1R3; this heterodimer
is sensitive to a variety of different sweet taste molecules,
including sugars, artificial sweeteners and sweet proteins
(Li et al. 2002). Recent studies suggest that activation of
sweet taste receptors in the intestinal epithelium enhances
both SGLT1 expression and GLUT2 insertion into the
BBM during carbohydrate digestion (Mace et al. 2007,
2009).Intestinalsweettastereceptoractivationbyartificial
sweeteners regulates glucose-dependent glucagon-like
peptide 1 (GLP1) secretion from L cells, but not gastric
inhibitory peptide (GIP) secretion from K cells (Jang
et al. 2007; Parker et al. 2009). Interestingly, although our
studies demonstrate that the artificial sweetener saccharin
enhances renal SGLT-mediated glucose transport and
SGLT1 protein expression, we were unable to detect
T1R2, T1R3 and the downstream signalling protein
α-gustducin in the kidney by qPCR. While numerous
sensory receptors have been reported to be expressed
in the kidney (including taste receptors; Rajkumar et al.
2014), recent RNAseq data using microdissected tubular
segments were unable to demonstrate expression of these
sweet taste receptors in any part of the mouse kidney
(Lee et al. 2015b). Thus, it is unlikely that the proximal
tubule response to saccharin results from ‘classical’ sweet
taste sensing.

An alternative glucose sensor, SGLT3, is expressed in
the submucosal and myenteric plexuses of the small
intestine (Diez-Sampedro et al. 2003) and in duodenal
enterochromaffin cells (Lee et al. 2015a). Recent studies
have shown that SGLT3 is involved in the co-ordinated
modulation of glucose absorption (via an increase in distal
jejunal SGLT1 expression) and GLP1 secretion (Lee et al.
2015a; Pal et al. 2015), with these effects occurring via
a vagally mediated pathway (Pal et al. 2015). However,
although SGLT3 may play a significant role in glucose
sensing in the intestine, it is unlikely to be responsible for
the increased renal SGLT1 activity in response to artificial
sweeteners, because, compared with intestinal SGLT3
expression, renal levels of SGLT3 mRNA are extremely
low (Barcelona et al. 2012) or undetectable (Matus Sotak,
personal communication).
A
potential
mechanism
through
which
glucose
transporter expression is regulated at the proximal tubule
BBM is through the local action of insulin. The insulin
receptor is present throughout the nephron, including
in the proximal tubule, with higher expression at the
basolateral membrane than at the BBM (Feraille et al.
1995). The action of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal glucose
handling is notably independent of insulin action, but
this is not the case for GLUT2 activity. A reduction in
the circulating concentration of insulin in type I diabetes
might provide a stimulus for recruitment of GLUT2 to
the BBM, an action of the hormone that has been noted
in jejunal enterocytes (Tobin et al. 2008), but would
not explain the raised GLUT2 levels at the BBM in the
prediabetic state seen after feeding of a junk-food or
high-fat diet. Therefore, GLUT2 expression at the renal
BBM, like SGLT expression, is likely to be mediated
through an insulin-independent pathway in metabolic
conditions.
The composition of diets has been demonstrated to
play a role in glucose transporter expression in the small
intestine. Consumption of a high-starch/low-fat pellet
diet, by rats, increases jejunal gene expression of SGLT1
and GLUT2 compared with a low-starch/high-fat diet,
and is likely to increase glucose transport across the
intestinal brush border (Inoue et al. 2015). Interestingly,
obese subjects who consume a high-fat/low-carbohydrate
diet display increased brush border GLUT2 expression
in fasting conditions (Ait-Omar et al. 2011). A study
by Gai et al. (2014) demonstrated that 2441 genes are
differentially expressed in renal tissue after a chronic
high-fat diet, but no studies have focused on renal
glucose transporter expression. Our findings show that
consumptionofahigh-fatdietelevatesGLUT2expression,
whereas a diet high in fat and sugars (junk-food diet)
increases SGLT1, SGLT2 and GLUT2. It is possible
that specific components of the diet, and the ratio of
carbohydrate to fat, can play a role in renal glucose
transporter expression to regulate glucose reabsorption.
In conclusion, metabolic dysregulation associated
with diabetes evokes changes in sodium-dependent and
sodium-independent glucose transport across the renal
BBM that have the potential to worsen hyperglycaemia or
cause diabetic renal injury. Although SGLT2 clearly plays
a key role in glucose transport across the proximal tubule
BBM, our data show that the kidney displays differential
responses in glucose transporter expression depending on
the severity and type of metabolic dysfunction present.
These findings demonstrate the complexity of the adaptive
response in renal tubular glucose transport in prediabetic
syndromes and type II diabetes. Furthermore, the efficacy
of the antihyperglycaemic effect of SGLT2 inhibitors
may vary with the progression of disease. Further
characterization of the signalling pathways involved in
renal glucose handling may allow a deeper understanding
of the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type II
diabetes and promote the development of further new
therapies for the treatment of diabetes and associated
kidney disease.
