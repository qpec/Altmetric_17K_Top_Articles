Several populations of wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) inhabit the area around Fukushima 
Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FNPP). To measure and control the size of these populations, macaques 
are captured annually. Between May 2013 and December 2014, we performed a haematological analysis 
of Japanese macaques captured within a 40-km radius of FNPP, the location of a nuclear disaster two 
years post-accident. The dose-rate of radiocaesium was estimated using the ERICA Tool. The median 
internal dose-rate was 7.6 μ
Gy/day (ranging from 1.8 to 219 μ
Gy/day) and the external dose-rate 
was 13.9 μ
Gy/day (ranging from 6.7 to 35.1 μ
Gy/day). We performed multiple regression analyses to 
estimate the dose-rate effects on haematological values in peripheral blood and bone marrow. The 
white blood cell and platelet counts showed an inverse correlation with the internal dose-rate in mature 
macaques. Furthermore, the myeloid cell, megakaryocyte, and haematopoietic cell counts were 
inversely correlated and the occupancy of adipose tissue was positively correlated with internal dose-
rate in femoral bone marrow of mature macaques. These relationships suggest that persistent whole 
body exposure to low-dose-rate radiation affects haematopoiesis in Japanese macaques.
The Great Japan Earthquake and subsequent tsunami of March 2011 caused the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear 
Power Plant (FNPP) accident, which released large amounts of artificial radioactive substances into the envi-
ronment1. After people were evacuated, wild animals inhabiting the area became contaminated with artificial 
radionuclides2. These animals were exposed to long-term irradiation with a low-dose-rate of internally and exter-
nally deposited radionuclides. Seven years have passed since the FNPP disaster, but the biological effect caused 
by long-term exposure to radioactive caesium, a persistent nuclide, remains a major concern. Various biological 
impacts have been reported after the FNPP accident3–6. In some studies, the estimations of dose and dose-rate 
were carried out and were associated with the effect of wild life and livestock7–12. However, the extent to which 
radiation exposure is contributing to these findings remains unclear, due to the uncertainty attributed to field-
work that is not controlled13,14.

Japanese macaques are a species of non-human primate with a life span of more than 20 years in a wild 
state. They form troops comprised of several dozen individuals with a mean home range size of 8.99 km2 (0.29–
39.7 km2), irrespective of evergreen or deciduous habitat15. Japanese macaques are omnivorous and feed on plant 
leaves, fruits, insects and other small animals16. Those living in the Fukushima prefecture become sexually mature 
at around 5 years old17. Several troops of macaques had settled in certain areas around FNPP before the acci-
dent18, making them suitable subjects for determining the effect of long-term exposure to low-dose-rate radiation 
on humans. Leucocyte count in peripheral blood has been reported to have a significant inverse correlation with 
the muscle radiocaesium concentration in immature macaques captured in Fukushima city, located approxi-
mately 70 km northwest of FNPP19.
Haematopoiesis is one of the main vital processes in the body of mammals and is one of the most radiosensi-
tive systems20. Bone marrow is the primary haematopoietic tissue in mammals, given that it produces all blood 
cells. Caused by moderate to high levels of radiation, acute whole-body irradiation reduces bone marrow cellu-
larity and blood cell count21,22. The haematopoietic system is highly sensitive to radiation; whether at a large or 
medium dose, acute exposure damages its function23. However, the effect of long-term exposure to low-dose-rate 
radiation on the haematopoietic system, especially that of bone marrow, remains to be elucidated.
In this study, we collected haematological data from 95 Japanese macaques captured within a 40-km radius 
of FNPP (the exposed group) and within a range of 60-km to 100-km of FNPP (the non-exposed group). We 
estimated internal and external radiocaesium dose-rates using the ERICA Tool, and performed multiple regres-
sion analyses to evaluate the dose-rate dependency on haematological values, adjusting for possible background 
(confounding) covariates. While the environmental dose-rate from radionuclides in the soil is approximately 
0.33 mSv/year in Japan24, the air dose-rate of several areas inhabited by the exposed group in this study was 
more than 100 times higher than the general background level25; therefore, haematological analysis of macaques 
inhabiting the area affected by the FNPP accident would provide insight into the effect of persistent exposure to 
low-dose-rate radiation on humans.
Results
Dose-rate and haematological values in peripheral blood. 
We obtained peripheral blood samples 
from 42 exposed and 23 non-exposed Japanese macaques (Fig. 1). The response of chemokine and cytokine fam-
ily genes to gamma irradiation is reportedly different between infant and adult mouse bone marrow tissues26. 
Ochiai, et al., previously divided Japanese monkeys into immature (0–4 years) and mature (5 years) groups19. 
Therefore, we adopted their classification in this study. The haematological values of peripheral blood are shown 
in Table 1. In members of the exposed group, the median radiocaesium (134Cs + 
137Cs) activity concentrations in 
mature and immature macaques were 2,250 Bq/kg (ranging from 285 to 34,600 Bq/kg) and 1,280 Bq/kg (ranging 
from 376 to 24,500 Bq/kg), respectively, in femoral muscle. In members of the non-exposed group, the concentra-
tions were 72.3 Bq/kg (ranging from 36.9 to 269.5 Bq/kg) for mature macaques and 57.3 Bq/kg for only one imma-
ture macaque. Red blood cell (RBC) count and hematocrit (Hct) were significantly lower in mature macaques of 
the exposed group than those of the non-exposed group.
Using the ERICA Tool, we calculated internal and external dose-rates from the concentration of combined 
134Cs and 137Cs (radiocaesium) in skeletal muscle and in soil, respectively (Table 2). The body size is different 
between mature and immature macaques, affecting the determination of dose conversion coefficient. Therefore, 
we estimated the dose-rate from dose conversion coefficients of four sizes of spheroids, as described in the 
Methods section. Minor and major axes of each spheroid were calculated by the plots of body length and body

weight of 65 macaques (Supplementary Fig. S1a). According to the home range size of Japanese macaques15, we 
calculated an average 137Cs concentration in soil within a 3-km radius (corresponding to the area of a 30-km2 
circle) from the capture point based on the mesh data of radiocaesium deposition in soil by the airborne monitor-
ing survey27. 137Cs concentration in soil of the capture point showed significantly positive correlation with mean 
137Cs concentration in soil within 30-km2 around the capture point (N = 79, r = 0.97, p < 0.001, Supplementary 
Fig. S2). We therefore propose that the external dose-rate calculated from that of the capture point in this study 
can be used as real external dose-rate. The radioactivity concentrations of radiocaecium in soil collected from the 
non-exposed area on December 28, 2012 were lower than 10,000 Bq/m2, which was undetectable by the airborne 
survey27. On the other hand, radiocaesium was detected in the skeletal muscle of members of the non-exposed 
group. The median internal dose-rate in the non-exposed group was 0.45 μ
Gy/day (0.24–1.73 μ
Gy/day). The 
median internal dose-rate was 7.6 μ
Gy/day (1.8–219 μ
Gy/day) and the external dose-rate was 13.9 μ
Gy/day 
(6.7–35.1 μ
Gy/day) in the exposed group. A weak positive correlation was found between external and internal 
dose-rates in the same individual (N = 69, r = 0.38, p < 0.001), whereas the combined internal and external (total) 
dose-rate was strongly associated with internal dose-rate (N = 69, r = 0.98 and p < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. S3).
We performed multiple regression analyses to evaluate dose-rate effects on haematological values in the 
peripheral blood of macaques, adjusting for the effect of confounding covariates such as sex, age, season of cap-
ture, and altitude of the capture point (adjusted by every 100 m). A significant contribution of internal dose-rate 
(a tendency to decrease with dose-rate) was detected in white blood cell (WBC) count and platelet (PLT) count 
in mature macaques. On the contrary, no correlation was observed between external dose-rate and any variable 
(Table 3 and Supplementary Table S1).
Dose-rate and haematopoietic cells in bone marrow. 
We obtained bone marrow samples from the femur 
of 18 mature and 20 immature macaques of the exposed group. We counted the cell number of each haematopoietic 
cell lineage in sampled bone marrow and analyzed a correlation of haematopoietic cells and dose-rate (Figs 2 and 3; 
Supplementary Table S2). Using similar methods, we also performed multiple regression analyses to examine dose-rate 
effects on haematopoietic values in bone marrow of macaques (Table 4 and Supplementary Table S3). In mature macaques, 
significant inverse correlations with internal dose-rate were detected in myeloid, megakaryocyte, and haematopoietic cell 
counts. In addition, the opposite tendency was detected in adipose tissue from bone marrow of mature macaques. On the 
other hand, no consistent correlation was observed between external dose-rate and haemotological values.
Discussion
Total dose-rate was highly associated with internal dose-rate (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that the quan-
tified effects found in this study reflect internal dose-rate. The soil radiocaesium concentration from the capture 
points showed a significantly positive correlation with mean radiocaesium concentration in soil within 30 km2 
around the capture point (Supplementary Fig. S2). The ratio of the mean radiocaesium concentration in soil

within 30 km2 from the capture point to the radiocaesium concentration of capture point was 1.12 ± 0.18 (S.D.), 
ranging from 0.92 to 1.57. We consider the error of the calculated external dose-rate to be within an allowable 
range. However, external dose-rate was not measured directly for each individual. In comparison with the inter-
nal dose-rate, more uncertainty may be mediated in the calculation of external dose-rate in this study.
It is important to investigate the living conditions and temporal dose-rate changes of macaques, in order 
to determine whether or not low-dose-rate radiation affects haematopoiesis. The variance of internal dose-rate 
was larger than that of external dose-rate in the exposed group (Table 2). Japanese macaques are omnivorous16. 
The variance of internal dose-rate in insects and small animals has been reported to be greater than the external 
dose-rate variance28. These data suggest that the variance of radiocaesium concentration in Japanese macaques 
is reflected by that of their prey. In our previous study, we analyzed the correlation of oxidative stress markers 
in calf peripheral blood with either internal or external dose, or with internal or external dose-rate. We found 
that oxidative stress status is closely related to internal dose-rate but to no other conditions11. We estimated the 
whole body dose-rate using the ERICA Tool and the haematopoietic cell count in bone marrow and correlated 
with the internal dose-rate (Table 4 and Supplementary Table S3). Various studies have reported that radiocae-
sium concentration in organs, including peripheral blood, is highly correlated with that in skeletal muscles in 
animals around FNPP after the accident29,30. Haematopoietic bone marrow is surrounded by skeletal muscles. 
Radiocaesium concentration tends to be highest in skeletal muscles, more than 20-fold that of peripheral blood. 
Furthermore, skeletal muscles compromise most of the body weight. Taken together, these suggest that internal 
dose-rate of bone marrow is derived from skeletal muscles, which can be estimated using radiocaesium con-
centration of femoral muscle. However, it is important to measure radionuclides in each organ for estimation of 
marrow dose-rate.
We chose populations of macaques residing at the same latitude and in adjacent prefectures to ensure that the 
environments were as identical as possible. Wild Japanese macaques may be infected with various pathogens. 
This can result in modest to marked effects on the intestine and its physiologic and immunologic functions, 
including peripheral blood cell count, so we carefully chose the members of the non-exposed group. We did 
not observe any macroscopic differences between the exposed and the non-exposed macaques, including coat 
and the amount of subcutaneous fat which are both affected by climate, nor did we observe any anomaly during 
dissection. Compared with the non-exposed group, the exposed group showed a lower RBC count and Hct, but 
these were still within the normal ranges. The mean altitude of capture points in the exposed group was signifi-
cantly lower than that of the non-exposed group (Table 1). The natural environment of the exposed group may be 
different from that of the non-exposed group. Therefore, to exclude the effect of confounding covariates like sex, 
age, and the condition of capture, we applied multiple regression analyses and adjusted for possible effects of the 
confounders to evaluate dose-rate effects on the haematological values in peripheral blood. WBC and PLT counts 
in the peripheral blood of mature macaques were revealed to be inversely correlated with internal dose-rate 
(Table 3 and Supplementary Table 1). It should be noted, however, that the present study was not performed 
under strictly controlled conditions, but used wild macaques, and we could not therefore rule out environmental 
factors as confounders. Data collected from macaques, a closely-related species to humans, will contribute to 
radiation protection in humans. Therefore, it is necessary to vigilantly monitor both exposed and non-exposed 
macaque groups over time to elucidate the ultimate effect of very low-dose-rate radiation on the haemopoietic 
system, which may indicate a similar response in humans.
The haematopoietic system is one of the most radiosensitive tissues in the body20. Bone marrow is composed 
of haematopoietic cells and adipocytes and radiation suppresses the haematopoietic system, leading to increased 
concentrations of adipocytes. Total lipids of rat bone marrow reach maximum levels 1 week after exposure to 
radiation as a function of dose, but total lipids slowly decrease with time. Similarly, 8 days after 8-Gy irradiation, 
monkeys show a decrease in total marrow31. In this study, the ratio of the occupancy area of haematopoietic cells

to adipocytes in bone marrow of mature macaques was positively correlated with internal dose-rate (Table 4 
and supplementary Table S3). This shows that persistent exposure to low-dose-rate radiation, as well as acute 
high-dose radiation, is toxic to haematopoietic systems. The haematopoietic system is organized in a hierar-
chical manner. For example, damaged multipotent progenitors and haematopoietic progenitor cells result in 
myelosuppression, which is consistent with the suppression of all lineages of haematopoietic cells. In mature 
macaques, myeloid cell, megakaryocyte, and haematopoietic cell counts in bone marrow were inversely correlated 
with internal dose-rate (Table 4 and Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, WBC and PLT counts in peripheral 
blood were inversely correlated with internal dose-rate (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S1). However, WBC 
and PLT counts in peripheral blood showed no significant difference between exposed group and non-exposed 
group (Table 1). Adult C57BL/6 mice exposed to gamma-ray radiation show a significantly decreased formation 
of mixed types of colonies of haematopoietic/progenitor cells in bone marrow, even under daily exposure to 
10 mGy for 1 month32. Being exposed to 22.6 μ
Gy/h of gamma-radiation for 2.5 years, free-ranging meadow vole 
populations have higher counts of neutrophils in peripheral blood than either the controls or high-dose voles 
(3,840 μ
Gy/h) but have lower hematocrit than the controls33. We recently reported that spermatogenesis was 
accelerated in large Japanese wild mice residing the ex-evacuation zone of the FNPP accident, but sperm num-
ber remained constant12. These findings suggest that the compensatory mechanism in haematopoiesis maintains 
homeostasis under persistent exposure to very low-dose-rate radiation and that radiation effects are different 
between laboratory animals and field animals. We need to continue to carefully observe and interpret the biolog-
ical effects induced by long-term exposure to very low-dose-rate radiation.
Ochiai, et al., reported that WBC counts in peripheral blood are inversely correlated with radiocaesium activ-
ity concentrations in the muscle, even though the mean values are lower than 1,000 Bq/kg in immature macaques 
captured in Fukushima city19. In our study, radioactivity concentrations of 137Cs in the femoral muscle of imma-
ture macaques of the exposed group ranged from 308 to 24,500 Bq/kg (median 1,200 Bq/kg), which is a remarka-
bly high level of internal radiocaesium compared with their study. In addition, we estimated internal and external 
dose-rates and performed multiple regression analyses for the dose-rate dependence of haematological values. 
However, we did not observe an association between any haematological value in peripheral blood and internal 
dose-rate in immature macaques (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S1). We previously reported that, based on 
the γ
H2AX foci, cattle from the ex-evacuation zone had significantly higher levels of DNA damage in lympho-
cytes compared to levels in non-affected cattle34. However, the damage levels gradually decreased from 500 to 700 
days after the FNPP accident. Our sampling was performed between May 2013 and December 2014, but Ochiai, 
et al., collected samples between April 2012 and March 2013. The contradiction in findings may be caused by the 
difference in the sampling period.
Our study revealed that the myeloid cell, megakaryocyte, and haematopoietic cell counts in bone marrow 
were inversely correlated with the internal dose-rate in mature macaques of the exposed group. The main cause 
of myelosuppression by persistent exposure to very low-dose-rate radiation remains unclear. We previously 
reported that the level of oxidative stress was significantly correlated with the internal dose-rate of radiocaesium. 
The levels were less than 50 μ
Gy/day in cattle captured from the ex-evacuation zone of the FNPP accident11. 
Hypersensitivity to irradiation has been reported in the haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of adult mice. Even 
irradiation of 0.02 Gy X-rays causes an immediate increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, total 
body irradiation with 0.02 Gy does not decrease HSC numbers unless the HSC microenvironment is altered 
by an inflammatory insult35. Health effects of people exposed to persistent low-dose gamma-ray derived from 
Iridium-192 were studied, in which the subjects received 0.05–0.65 Gy for 72 days and, over the course of 10 
years, various degrees of immune dysfunction and abnormalities of blood cells and bone marrow are identified. 
Participants recovered within 1–3 years of exposure36. Levels of Chernobyl liquidators at or above 200 mGy result 
in an increased risk of leukemia, after excluding smoking as a major confounding factor37. An international 
cohort study of nuclear workers reveal positive associations between chronic low-dose radiation exposure and 
excess relative risk of leukaemia mortality in nuclear workers exposed to very low-dose (mean 1.1 mGy/year)

radiation. The mean follow-up period of the study is 27 years38. Ramsar, Iran is among the places in the world 
with the highest levels of natural radiation. This has had a non-detrimental effect on the people living there, who 
seem to have adapted to mean annual exposure levels of 10 (and up to 260) mGy/year39,40. This suggests that the 
effect of long-term very low-dose-rate radiation is a consequence of complicated biological responses. We there-
fore propose that continuous observation on the macaques inhabiting around FNPP is necessary to determine 
whether long-term exposure to low-dose-rate radiation induces irreversible myelosuppression, maintains basal 
haematopoiesis, or causes haematological malignancies. Cytogenetic dosimetry is recognized as a valuable assess-
ment method in measuring acute exposure to more than 100 mGy of low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation41. 
Collaborative efforts are now underway to identify chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 
Japanese macaques for biological dose evaluation.
This study is the first to report that haematopoiesis may be adversely affected by low-dose-rate radiation in 
primates. To understand the human response to long-term exposure to very low-dose-rate radiation, Japanese 
macaques inhabiting the area affected by the FNPP accident are the most suitable wild animal, since they do not 
recognize or fear radiation and do not smoke, which is the most confounding factor in analyzing the effects of 
low-dose radiation on humans. Therefore, the present study provides extremely crucial data for understanding 
the effect of chronic, very low-dose-rate radiation on humans. Radiocaesium concentrations in the organs of 
macaques belonging to the exposed group have been continuously high, attributable to the intake of radiocon-
taminated foods. The life span of Japanese macaques is approximately 20 years, and many individuals born after 
the FNPP accident have been observed. Therefore, macaques inhabiting the exposed area are suitable to study 
in order to identify and measure the effects, including transgenerational effects, of chronic very low-dose-rate 
irradiation on humans. We should vigilantly monitor these populations of macaques over time.
Methods
Animals and Ethics statements. 
Japanese macaques were culled to prevent damage to crops according 
to the Japanese Monkey Management Plan based on the Wildlife Protection and Hunting Management Law. 
Macaques were captured using box traps and killed by licensed hunters at the request of each local government. 
The method of capture and killing was carried out according to the guidelines published by the Primate Research 
Institute of Kyoto University42. Japanese macaques inhabiting the areas of this study were not listed as endangered 
species on the Japanese Red List revised by the Ministry of Environment, Japan43.
This entire study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Center for 
Laboratory Animal Research, Tohoku University (Approved number: 2014 IDAC-037). All experiments were 
performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The macaques analyzed in this study were 
captured from May 2013 to December 2014. The exposed group consisted of 72 macaques (71 from Minamisoma 
city and 1 from Iitate village) in Fukushima prefecture. The non-exposed (control) group consisted of 23 
macaques (17 from Shichikasyuku Town, 4 from Sendai City, and 2 from Kawasaki Town) in Miyagi prefecture 
(Fig. 1). We obtained 42 peripheral blood samples, 69 femoral muscles, and 38 femurs from the exposed group. 
From the non-exposed group, we collected 23 peripheral blood samples and 15 femoral muscles. The age of each 
macaque was determined by counting growth layers in the dental cementum44. The macaques were divided into 
2 groups: the immature group (0–4 years) and the mature group (5 years) according to Ochiai, et al.19.
Measurement of radioactivity concentration. 
Radioactivity was determined by gamma-ray spectrom-
etry, specifically by using high-purity Germanium detectors, as described previously29. In brief, duration of the 
measurement varied from 3,600 to 86,400 seconds, depending on the radioactivity concentration of the sample. 
Standard volume sources of different sizes were prepared by diluting stock solutions of 137Cs and 152Eu and by gel-
ling with a highly absorbent polymer. Samples were homogenized and scaled in a polyethylene tube. The nuclide 
was identified by its characteristic photopeaks (greater than 3σ
 above the baseline). Samples were stored at −
30 °C 
until radioactivity measurements were taken. Therefore, the radioactivity concentration of radiocaesium was 
corrected to the capture date.
Haematological analysis. 
Peripheral blood was collected from the hearts of the carcasses and was imme-
diately mixed in a tube containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na). The numbers of 
WBC, RBC, and PLT, haemoglobin concentration (Hb), and Hct were measured with a full automatic blood cell 
counter (PCE-310, ERMA Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
We examined bone marrow from the femurs of 18 mature (8–10 years) and 20 immature macaques (2–4 years) 
of the exposed group. The femur was cut at its central part immediately after sampling, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 
and decalcified in 10% EDTA-2Na at room temperature. Paraffin-embedded bone marrow tissue from the femur 
was sectioned and stained with Giemsa solution. The image of stained specimens was captured by a Virtual Slide 
System VS120-L100 (OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan). The cell number of each haematopoietic cell lineage, such as 
erythroid cells, myeloid cells, and megakaryocytes, was counted in bone marrow image of a 2000 pixel (170 nm/
pixel) square. The occupancy of haematopoietic cells and adipose tissue was calculated using an open source 
image processing program, ImageJ45.
Dose-rate estimation. 
Dose-rate by radiocaesium exposure in Japanese macaques was calculated using 
the ERICA Tool (version 1.2)46 with some modifications. The ERICA Tool’s default radiation weighting factors 
of 1 for β
/γ
-rays and 3 for low energy β
-rays were used. The following conditions were used in this study: Tier 
2 assessment, “Terrestrial”
, “Mammal”
, “Ground-living animal”
, “On-soil,” and an occupancy factor value of 1.0. 
For the calculation of external dose-rate, the infinite plane isotopic source at 0.5 g/cm2 depth was defined as the 
radionuclide distribution patterns in soil. To determine dose conversion coefficients (DCCs) using the equation 
provided by the ERICA Tool, we used a spheroid to approximate the shape of the macaque’s body, with the body

length spanning across the long axis. We plotted the body length and the body weight of 65 macaques. Assuming 
that the specific gravity of the body is 1.0, we calculated the body width, which was imputed as the minor axis 
of the equation. For the body length, we used 30 cm for individuals between 25 and 35 cm. Likewise, 40, 50, and 
60 cm were used instead of the actual body length (Supplementary Fig. S1). DCCs were calculated and are shown 
in Supplementary Table S4.
Several studies have reported that radiocaesium activity concentration is the highest in the skeletal mus-
cle among the organs measured in animals inhabiting areas near the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant 
(FNPP) accident29,30. Assuming that the whole body of the macaque was composed of skeletal muscle, the 
internal dose-rate was calculated using the radioactivity concentration of radiocaesium in the femoral muscle. 
Calculations of external dose-rate were based on deposited radiocaesium in soil, where Japanese macaques were 
captured. The available mesh data of radiocaesium deposited in soil, provided by the airborne monitoring survey, 
was closest temporally (December 28, 2012) to our study (May 2013 to December 2014)27. Using these mesh data, 
the radiocasesium deposit density was calculated and the external dose-rate was corrected, based on physical 
delay, to the sampling day. Total dose-rate indicates the sum of internal and external dose-rate.
Statistical Analyses. 
Welch’s t-test was used to compare haematological values in peripheral blood between 
the exposed and non-exposed groups.
We performed multiple regression analyses for the dose-rate dependence of peripheral blood and bone mar-
row cells. As explanatory variables, we chose internal dose-rate, external dose-rate, age, sex, season of capture and 
altitude of the capture site (adjusted by every 100 m). The regression models can be elaborated as follows:
Given a set of data {(Yi, agei, mature, sexi, seaseoni, altitudei), i = 1, …, n (serial number of individual)}, we 
assumed the regression model was specified as:

The least squares method was applied for estimating the unknown parameters. Since the number of samples 
(n) is small, based on AIC (Akaike’s Information Criterion)47, we optimized the model with selecting variables 
of confounding background factor candidates. The R software (ver. 3.4)48 was used for implementing statistical 
data analyses. Using the parallel method with the same explanatory variables to the analyses of peripheral blood 
cells, we also performed multiple regression analyses for dose-rate dependency of bone marrow cells. We set our 
significance level at <0.05 for all statistical procedures.
