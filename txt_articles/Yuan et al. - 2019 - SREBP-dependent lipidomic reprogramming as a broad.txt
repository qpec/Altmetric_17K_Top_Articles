Viruses are obligate intracellular microbes that exploit the host metabolic machineries to
meet their biosynthetic demands, making these host pathways potential therapeutic targets.
Here, by exploring a lipid library, we show that AM580, a retinoid derivative and RAR-α
agonist, is highly potent in interrupting the life cycle of diverse viruses including Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus and influenza A virus. Using click chemistry, the over-
expressed sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) is shown to interact with
AM580, which accounts for its broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Mechanistic studies pin-
point multiple SREBP proteolytic processes and SREBP-regulated lipid biosynthesis pathways,
including the downstream viral protein palmitoylation and double-membrane vesicles for-
mation, that are indispensable for virus replication. Collectively, our study identifies a basic
lipogenic transactivation event with broad relevance to human viral infections and represents
SREBP as a potential target for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.

nfectious diseases account for ~20% of global mortality, and
viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths1. In
the past 20 years, emerging and re-emerging viruses such as
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, avian influenza A
(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses, pandemic 2009 influenza A virus
(H1N1), Zika virus, and enteroviruses have posed significant
global public health threats2–8. Rapid and effective control of
these epidemics at their onset was often not possible due to the
long time lag required for the development of specific antivirals or
vaccines. Early empirical administration of a highly effective
broad-spectrum antiviral would improve patients’ outcome and
facilitate the control of these epidemics if given before or soon
after the exact pathogen is identified. Current strategies for the
development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents mainly focus on
two aspects, virus encoded targets, and host defense factors or
cellular machineries that are exploited by viruses9. Successful
examples of virus-targeting strategy include blockers of viral
attachment and fusion10,11, as well as inhibitors targeting viral
enzymes, such as protease, polymerase, and neuraminidase, or
internal structural proteins12. On the other aspect, type I inter-
ferons (IFNs) and IFN-induced proteins can be used to trigger the
cellular machineries of host defense to suppress viral replication.
Nevertheless, challenges of drug toxicity and emergence of
resistant viral progenies remain to be addressed.
To fulfill the requirements of rapid and massive clonal repli-
cation, viruses must co-opt distinct programs to meet heightened
metabolic demands. A key component in such reprogramming is
the rapid up-regulation of lipid biosynthetic pathways, which can
substantially impact on the viral replication process. Lipids have
been recognized as structural elements of viral and cellular
membranes. Viruses induce the formation of novel cytoplasmic
membrane structures and compartments, in which viral genome
replication and assembly occurs with perhaps shielding from host
innate immune response. The involvement of lipids in the viral
replication cycle is shared by enveloped and non-enveloped
viruses, as well as both DNA and RNA viruses13. The correlation
between virus infection and host lipid metabolism has been
implicated in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)14. Infection with
HCMV markedly upregulated flux through much of the central
carbon metabolism particularly in flux through the tricarboxylic
acid cycle and its efflux to the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.
Here, we demonstrate the essential role of lipid metabolic
reprograming in MERS-CoV replication, an enveloped RNA virus
highly divergent from HCMV. Thus, the modulation of cellular
lipid metabolism to interfere with virus multiplication may be an
appealing, broadly applicable approach for antiviral therapy. To
this end, we carry out a pharmacological screening of a lipid
library. AM580, a retinoid derivative and RAR-α agonist,
demonstrates potent and broad-spectrum antiviral activities
in vitro and in vivo. Using AM580 as a tool compound, we
modify it by click chemistry and identify the host cell sterol
regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) as the direct binding
target of AM580. SREBPs are bHLH-zip transcription factors that
have well-defined roles in the regulation of cellular lipid home-
ostasis. In mammals, there are two SREBP genes that express
three SREBP proteins. SREBP1a and SREBP1c are produced via
alternative transcriptional start sites on Srebf1, whereas the Srebf2
gene encodes SREBP2. Canonical SREBP1c signaling pre-
ferentially drives expression of fatty acid biosynthesis genes
whereas SREBP2 predominately transactivates genes involved in
cholesterol biosynthesis, intracellular lipid movement and lipo-
protein import15. Mechanistically, we find that AM580 blocks the
interaction of SREBP1/2 proteins with the non-palindromic sterol
regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoter/enhancer regions of
multiple lipogenic genes, which inhibits their transcription and
thus reverses the virus-induced lipid hyper-biosynthesis. Collec-
tively, our study identifies SREBP-mediated lipid biosynthesis
with broad relevance to human viral infections and represents
SREBP as an undescribed target for the development of broad-
spectrum intervention strategies, especially for tackling novel
viruses causing emerging infectious diseases.
Results
Virus infection reprogrammed host lipid metabolism. To
understand the host response to virus infection, we determined
the transcriptomic profile of human bronchial epithelial Calu-3
cells infected with MERS-CoV. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment
of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed to
explore multiple aspects of virus–host interaction, including cel-
lular processes, environmental information processing, genetic
information processing, human diseases, organismal systems, and
metabolism (Fig. 1a). Within the major category of metabolism,
there is a combinational GO item with many global and overview
maps that comprise sub-items such as carbon metabolism, fatty
acid metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and
biosynthesis of amino acids16. Notably, lipid metabolism was the
top-ranking
affected
metabolic
pathway,
highlighting
the
importance of lipids among the metabolic changes triggered by
MERS-CoV infection. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that
steroid biosynthesis being the most highly enriched pathway,
which indicated the markedly heightened lipid demands during
MERS-CoV life cycle (Supplementary Figure 1a). To explore
how MERS-CoV infection perturbed lipid metabolism, an
untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed in MERS-CoV-
infected Calu-3 cells. Lipid features significantly changed with p <
0.05
(Student’s
t-test)
in
MERS-CoV-infected
cells
were
selected. For better demonstration of changed lipids profile trend
after
MERS-CoV
infection,
a
Heatmap
was
constructed
according to the identified lipid list (Supplementary Data 1). As
shown in Fig. 1b, these changed lipid features include glycer-
ophospholipid and fatty acids classes, indicating that MERS-CoV
infection strongly perturbed lipid homeostasis. To map the
landscape of metabolic-transcriptional alterations in the context
of virus infection, we performed an integrated transcriptomic and
lipidomic analysis to simultaneously map genes and lipid meta-
bolites in different pathways. As shown in Fig. 1c, integrative
network modeling specifically revealed that the glyceropho-
spholipid metabolism pathway was most dramatically modulated
by MERS-CoV infection. Collectively, we demonstrated that
MERS-CoV infection triggered marked host lipid metabolic
changes.
To investigate the importance of lipid metabolites in virus life
cycle, we screened a lipid library using MERS-CoV and H1N1
virus infections. Colorimetric assays reflecting cell viability were
performed to select compounds that inhibited the cytopathic
effects (CPE) that develop upon virus infection (Fig. 1d).
Screening conditions were optimized, in which at 0.1 MOI and
24 h post-MERS-CoV infection and at 0.01 MOI and 48 h post-
H1N1
infection
were
chosen,
respectively
(Supplementary
Figure 1b, c). A lipid metabolite with anti-inflammatory effects,
25-hydroxyvitamin D3, protected Huh7 cells against MERS-CoV
infection, while the aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist FICZ and
apoptosis regulatory messenger C16 Ceramide protected MDCK
cells against H1N1 infection. Notably, AM580, a synthetic
agonist, exhibited cell protection against both viruses and was
selected for further investigations (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, (R)-
methandamide, an agonist of cannabinoid receptor that func-
tionally increased lipid accumulation in hepatocytes17, facilitated
virus replication at non-toxic concentrations, thus caused more

AM580 exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral effects in vitro. The
cytotoxicity of AM580 was similar in different cell lines (CC50:
100–200 µM; Supplementary Figure 2a). Using MERS-CoV

 performed to plot the virus replication kinetics with or without
AM580. Strikingly, AM580 treatment reduced viral titers in the
cell supernatant by >3-log10 when compared with the dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) control, and the infectious plaque-forming
units (PFUs) in the AM580 group remained at baseline levels
during the whole time-course (Fig. 2a). Expression of MERS-CoV
nucleoprotein (NP) was dramatically decreased upon AM580
addition, especially at 9 h post-infection (hpi) and 1 MOI
(Fig. 2b). Flow cytometry showed that the percentage of MERS-
CoV-infected cells after AM580 treatment decreased from 65%
(DMSO) to 5.38% (AM580) at 24 hpi (upper panel, Fig. 2c).
Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining for MERS-CoV NP
suggested near-complete suppression of virus infection upon
AM580 treatment (lower panel, Fig. 2c). AM580 also significantly
reduced MERS-CoV replication in multiple cell types, including
lung (A549 and Calu-3), kidney (Vero), and immune cells [THP-
1 and human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs)]
(Fig. 2d) as well as human primary small airway epithelial cells
(HSAEC) (Fig. 2e). Moreover, AM580 suppressed virus-induced
pro-inflammatory cytokine activation in Huh7 cells and MDMs
(Supplementary Figure 3). Overall, AM580 showed potent anti-
MERS-CoV activity in cell cultures with significant inhibition of
virus
replication,
cell
protection,
and
anti-inflammatory
responses.
We previously established the human intestinal organoids
(intestinoids) as an alternative route of virus transmission for
MERS-CoV and an ideal tool for pharmacological evaluation18.
Herein, we inoculated these intestinoids with 0.1 MOI of MERS-
CoV and evaluated the effect of AM580. Our data demonstrated
that AM580 treatment significantly (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA)
reduced MERS-CoV replication intra- and extra-cellularly (Fig. 2f,
g). At 48 hpi, no PFU was detectable in AM580-treated
intestinoid culture supernatants, representing a nearly 6-log10
reduction in titers when compared with DMSO-treated controls
(Fig. 2f). The inhibition of MERS-CoV by AM580 was also
evidenced by the markedly decreased expression of viral NP in
the AM580-treated intestinoids when compared with the DMSO-
treated intestinoids (Fig. 2h). Collectively, we demonstrated that
AM580 robustly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in human
intestinoids.
Our screening of a lipid library demonstrated the broad-
spectrum antiviral potential of AM580 (Fig. 1d). Next, we
investigated AM580’s in vitro antiviral effect against other viruses
especially the emerging or respiratory pathogens, including both
RNA [SARS-CoV, H1N1 virus, enterovirus-A71 (EV-A71), and
Zika virus (ZIKV)] and DNA [human adenovirus type 5 (AdV5)]
viruses. Notably, AM580 inhibited the replication of all evaluated
viruses at 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) ranging from
nanomolar to micromolar scales in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 2i). The selectivity index of AM580 was remarkable
for most of the tested viruses, in particular for MERS-CoV (507),
SARS-CoV (114), and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (159),
suggesting the potential for safe usage of AM580 or its clinically
available analogs in therapeutic settings for a broad spectrum of
viral pathogens (Supplementary Figure 2c).
AM580 exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral effects in vivo. To
evaluate the in vivo antiviral activity of AM580, we first examined
whether the drug conferred protection against lethal challenge
with MERS-CoV in human DPP4 (hDPP4)-transgenic mice18.
Previous pharmacokinetics study revealed that AM580 has a
relatively large apparent volume of distribution (1.1–1.5/kg) and
small
clearance
(8.8–9.7 ml/min/kg),
with
pharmacokinetic
behavior linear within the dose range from 2 to 10 mg/kg after
intraperitoneal injection19. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation of
the maximal amount of AM580 soluble in PBS (12.5 mg/kg) for
7 days resulted in no signs of toxicity (Supplementary Figure 2b).
In mice challenged with 50 PFU of MERS-CoV, all 20/20 mice
(100%) survived after they received 3 days of i.p. injection of
AM580, whereas 14/20 DMSO-treated mice died (survival rate
30%; Fig. 3a). Mice in the AM580-treated group exhibited sig-
nificantly less body weight loss (p < 0.05, Student’s t-test) than
that of the DMSO-treated group on days 4 and 5 post-infection
(Fig. 3b), and with lower lung tissue virus titers and viral loads (p
< 0.01, Student’s t-test) at days 2 and 4 (Fig. 3c; Supplementary
Figure 7e). On day 4 post-challenge, the viral RNA load in brain
tissues of the AM580-treated mice was undetectable and was 4-
log10 lower than that of the DMSO-treated mice (Supplementary
Figure 7e). Histopathologic examination showed that alveolar
damage and interstitial inflammatory infiltration in the lung tis-
sues of the AM580-treated mice were substantially diminished
compared to the control mice (Fig. 3d). Collectively, these results
demonstrated
that
AM580
effectively
protected
hDPP4-
transgenic mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge by inhibiting
MERS-CoV replication and virus-associated pneumonia and
encephalitis in vivo.
In parallel, the antiviral effects of AM580 against the highly
pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H7N9) were evaluated in
Balb/c mice20. In mice challenged with 100 PFU of H7N9,
intranasal AM580 treatment resulted in significantly higher
survival rates (6/10, 60%; vs 0/10 in DMSO-treated controls,
0%; p < 0.01, log-rank test) (Fig. 3e). AM580-treated mice showed
less body weight loss than that of DMSO-treated group from day
3 to day 7 post-infection (Fig. 3f). The mean viral RNA load in
the lung tissues of AM580-treated mice was significantly (p <
0.01, Student’s t-test) lower than that of control mice (Fig. 3g;
Supplementary
Figure
7f).

MERS-CoV (0.01 MOI). Viral titers in cell culture supernatants were quantified by plaque assay at different time points. Differences between DMSO (open
circle) and AM580 (20 µM, black square) groups were analyzed by Student’s t-test. b Western blot showed reduced MERS-CoV NP production after
AM580 treatment. Huh7 cells were infected with 1 MOI MERS-CoV. c Upper panel: MERS-CoV-NP-positive cells quantitated by flow cytometry. Lower
panel: immunofluorescence staining of MERS-CoV-NP antigen (green) and cell nucleus (blue). Scale bar:10 µm. d AM580 reduced MERS-CoV replication
in cell culture supernatants of A549 (0.1 MOI), Calu-3 (0.1 MOI), and Vero (0.01 MOI) cells at 24 hpi. AM580 reduced MERS-CoV replication in cell
lysates of monocyte-derived macrophage cells (MDM, 1 MOI) and THP-1 (0.1 MOI) at 24 hpi. Differences between DMSO and AM580 groups were
analyzed by Student’s t-test. e AM580 inhibited MERS-CoV replication in human primary small airway epithelial cells (HSAEC) that were infected by 1
MOI MERS-CoV and treated with (red square) or without AM580 (black triangle). Supernatant and cell lysate were collected at the indicated time points
and titrated by plaque assay and RT-qPCR assay, respectively. f, g AM580 showed anti-MERS-CoV activity in human intestinal organoid (intestinoid).
f One-way ANOVA was used for comparison of the AM580 treated with the DMSO treated. g Representative images of intestinoids, after
immunofluorescence staining for MERS-CoV NP (green), DAPI, and Phalloidin (purple), were 3D-imaged with a confocal microscope. Scale bar: 20 µm.
h AM580 showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against six different viruses as indicated. Plaque reduction assays were performed to evaluate antiviral
activity of AM580 in MERS-CoV (Huh7 cells, magenta triangle) and SARS-CoV (Huh7 cells, magenta rectangle), ZIKV (Vero cells, black triangle), H1N1
virus (MDCK cells, black diamond), EV-A71 (RD cells, blue dot). TCID50 assays were used for AdV5 titration (HEp-2 cells, blue triangle). Shown are the

 components of lipid metabolism that exhibited broad relevance to
human viral infections. First, we used an immunofluorescence
test to visualize the distribution patterns of cellular lipid droplets
(LDs) and cholesterol in the presence or absence of AM580 in
MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells, which are liver cells highly active
in lipid metabolism. Infection by MERS-CoV markedly enhanced
the accumulation of LDs and cholesterol, whereas addition of
AM580 significantly reduced their accumulation (Fig. 4a). To
validate this observation, mRNA expression of lipogenic genes in
the lipid biosynthesis pathways were investigated. Significant
decreases in mRNA expression were detected in 13/17 (76.5%)
genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (upper panel, Fig. 4b)
and 10/12 (83.3%) genes in cholesterol synthesis pathways (lower
panel, Fig. 4b) in AM580-treated infected cells, when compared

 with those of the DMSO-treated infected controls. Moreover, the
profound increase of the major lipogenic enzymes, including
acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and
HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS) associated with MERS-CoV
infection indicated that the virus rapidly upregulated lipid bio-
synthesis, while AM580 might antagonize these changes, thereby
reducing virus replication.
Searching of the upstream proteins regulating the host
lipogenic pathway showed that SREBPs are the major factors
that control lipid biosynthesis through transactivation of genes
encoding the lipogenic enzyme21. To evaluate the role of SREBPs
on MERS-CoV replication, we compared the growth of MERS-
CoV in wild-type control cells (mock) and SREBP gene silencing
or hyper-expression cells. Notably, transfection of SREBP1- or
SREBP2-targeted siRNAs diminished the precursor SREBPs (pre-
SREBPs) production, which significantly (p < 0.05, one-way
ANOVA) reduced MERS-CoV replication (Fig. 4c). Though the
expression level of SREBP1 and SREBP2 in double knockdown is
not more reduced than that of the individual knockdown because
only 50% the amount of siRNA for each SREBP was applied, the
double knockdown of both SREBPs resulted in about 2 log10 (p <
0.01, one-way ANOVA) decrease of infectious virus particle when

both SREBP1 and 2 (siRNA 1_2 and 2_2) reduced MERS-CoV replication. The knockdown efficiency and specificity was evaluated with western blot. siRNA-
treated cells (100 nM siRNA for single knockdown and 50 nM each for double knockdown for 48 h) were infected with MERS-CoV (0.001 MOI and 24
hpi). Viral titer in the cell culture supernatant was evaluated with plaque assay. One-way ANOVA was used for comparison with the control siRNA pre-
treated group. d Hyper-expression of nuclear form SREBP1 and SREBP2 by transfection to Huh7 cells for 24 h, respectively, followed by MERS-CoV

antibodies. Differences in viral titer were compared with the vector-transfected control and analyzed using Student’s t-test. e AM580 inhibited
transactivation of lipogenic genes such as FAS (blue dots) and HMGCS (red square) but not LXRE (black triangle). Huh7 cells transfected with the
indicated reporter plasmid were treated with serial-dilutions of AM580 for 24 h. For virus infection assays, AM580 was added after virus absorption; for
luciferase assay, AM580 was added 6 h after plasmid transfection. Student’s t-test was used to compare the AM580-treated with DMSO-treated groups.

 compared with the 1 log10 reduction of individual knockdown,
which indicated a potential synergistic effects when both activities
of SREBP1 and SREBP2 were inhibited. Together, this result
indicated that SREBPs were essential for MERS-CoV replication.
Transactivation of lipid biosynthesis genes requires cleavage of
pre-SREBPs to release their N-terminal nuclear forms (n-
SREBPs), a process which is regulated by sterols22. Over-
expression of either n-SREBP1 or n-SREBP2, however, dimin-
ished the antiviral potency of AM580 by about 1.5-log10 upon
MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 4d). Together, these results indicated a
pro-viral role of n-SREBPs in MERS-CoV replication and an
inhibitory role of AM580 on n-SREBPs’ activity.
To further confirm if the functionality of SREBP1 and/or
SREBP2 are affected by AM580, reporter gene assays reflecting
SREBPs-dependent transcriptional activation were performed. As
shown in Fig. 4e, lipogenic enzymes such as HMGCS and FAS
were blocked at the transcriptional level. However, the Liver X
Receptor response element (LXRE), which is required for the
activation of SREBP23, was not affected. These results indicated
that AM580 might specifically disrupt the transactivation of
lipogenic enzymes mediated by n-SREBPs.
AM580 blocked n-SREBPs binding to SREs. FAS and HMGCS
are two lipogenic enzymes that belong to separate lipid
biosynthesis pathways. Inhibition of both genes transactivation,
as shown in Fig. 4e, led us to suspect that AM580 functions to
interrupt the interaction of n-SREBPs with the SREs that are
conserved in lipogenic promoters including FAS, ACC, HMGCS,
etc. To this end, SREBP1/2 transcription factor assays were per-
formed, in which specific double stranded DNA (dsDNA)
sequences containing the n-SREBP1- or n-SREBP2-binding SREs
were immobilized in the solid phase. Binding intensity of nuclear-
extracted n-SREBP1 or n-SREBP2 was then detected in the pre-
sence or absence of inhibitors. Notably, AM580 inhibited the
binding of both n-SREBP1 (Fig. 5a) and n-SREBP2 (Supple-
mentary Figure 5a) with their corresponding SREs, whereas the
compounds FICZ and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 did not (Supple-
mentary Figure 7m). To determine whether AM580 targets n-
SREBPs or SREs, we pre-incubated AM580 with either immobi-
lized SRE-dsDNA before adding n-SREBPs or with n-SREBPs
before binding with SRE-dsDNA. Taking n-SREBP1 as an
example, AM580 was found to bind with n-SREBP1 and not SRE-
dsDNA, and inhibited the SRE-dsDNA binding activity of n-
SREBP1 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5b).
Next, to determine the interacting residue(s) on n-SREBPs that
are responsible for AM580 binding, we first performed molecular
docking analysis using the published crystal structures of SREBP1
and SREBP2 (refs. 24,25). The V-shape DNA-binding domain of

 n-SREBP1 and 2 shows structurally similarity and binds AM580
as a homodimer (Fig. 5c). Taking n-SREBP1 as an example,
AM580 binds to the E-box site through four amino acids (His328,
Glu332, Tyr335, and Arg336) that are highly conserved among
helix–loop–helix proteins (Supplementary Figure 5b). The major
interaction was predicted to be between AM580 and residue
Tyr335 by a hydrogen bond. Importantly, the Tyr335 that
determines SRE recognition24 is completely conserved between
human and mouse SREBPs (lower panel, Fig. 5c), which may
explain the conservation of the broad spectrum antiviral property
of AM580 in human cells and in mouse models.
To explore if AM580 inhibits the DNA-binding activity of
SREBPs by physically blocking SRE recognition (i.e. via Tyr335),
we introduced an Y335R mutation into n-SREBP1 and compared
its AM580 binding capacity with that of the wild-type protein. An
AM580-derived
probe
with
biotin
and
photo-affinity
tags
(AM580dp) was synthesized to facilitate the evaluation of its
binding characteristics. The AM580dp was made by introducing a
linker arm containing an azido end to the carboxylic acid group
on AM580, yielding the azido-AM580, which was designed for
further addition of a tri-functional linker with UV photo-affinity
and biotin tags with specific probing functionalities (Fig. 5d). Like
AM580, azido-AM580 inhibited MERS-CoV replication in Huh7
and Vero cells (Supplementary Figure 5c). Next, using an azido-
reactive green fluorescent dye for localization, azido-AM580 was
found largely in the host cell nucleus, which corroborated our
hypothesis that AM580 may target a lipogenic transactivation
event (Fig. 5e). To capture the binding target, AM580dp was
immobilized on streptavidin-conjugated agarose by its biotin
group and incubated with transfected cell lysates expressing WT
or Y335R n-SREBP1. RAR-α, a known AM580 receptor, was co-
transfected as a control. After ultraviolet irradiation to activate
the crosslinking photo-affinity tag in AM580dp, the protein-
AM580dp complex was fixed and isolated. As shown in Fig. 5f,
almost equal amounts of RAR-α were precipitated by AM580dp
in both WT or mutant Y335R n-SREBP1 groups, indicating that
AM580dp was biologically functional. However, significantly
more WT n-SREBP1 was detected than Y335R n-SREBP1,
suggesting a stronger binding affinity between AM580 and WT
n-SREBP1 than that of Y335R n-SREBP1. In addition, SRE
binding activity of n-SREBP1 was significantly (p < 0.01, Student’s
t-test) diminished when Tyr335 was substituted with arginine,
which highlighted the crucial role of Tyr335 in SRE recognition
(Supplementary Figure 5d). Taken together, we concluded that
AM580 disrupted n-SREBP1 and SRE binding, specifically via
impairing the SRE-recognition functionality of n-SREBP1.
Block of SREBPs-dependent pathways reduced viral fitness.
Disruption of n-SREBP and SRE interaction leads to failure of
lipogenic transactivation. To elucidate these downstream con-
sequences, we investigated one of the SREBP-mediated pathways,
fatty acid synthesis. First, we explored the ability of an end-
product of the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, sodium
palmitate, to reverse the antiviral activity of AM580. Notably,
both C75 (a FAS inhibitor specific for fatty acid biosynthesis
pathway) and AM580 showed anti-MERS-CoV activity (Fig. 6a).
Addition of sodium palmitate did not affect the virus yield in
MERS-CoV-infected cells treated with DMSO, but increased the
virus yield (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) in MERS-CoV-infected
cells treated with either AM580 or C75 (Fig. 6a). This finding
suggested that MERS-CoV replication hijacked host fatty acid
synthesis, which can be inhibited through shut-down of lipogenic
transactivation while rescued by exogenous palmitate. Next, we
explored whether fatty acid synthesis was critically involved in the
replication of other AM580-inhibited viruses. To this end,
replication rescue assays using H1N1 (negative-strand RNA virus
representative), EV-A71 (non-enveloped RNA virus representa-
tive), and AdV5 (DNA virus representative) were performed
(Fig. 6b, d). Indeed, significant (p < 0.05, Student’s t-test) extents
of rescue were achieved for these viruses and especially H1N1
virus
(p < 0.01,
Student’s
t-test)
with
addition
of
sodium
palmitate.
Positive-sense RNA viruses are known to replicate their
genomes on intracellular membranes. For MERS-CoV, double-
membrane vesicles (DMVs) provide the anchoring scaffold for
viral replication/transcription complexes, which might be dis-
rupted by the blockade of fatty acid synthesis. Using electron
microscopy, perinuclear DMV clusters were readily detectable in
MERS-CoV-infected cells (left panel, Fig. 6e). In contrast, almost
no DMVs were visualized after treatment by AM580 (right panel,
Fig. 6e). Since co-expression of nsp3 and nsp4 of MERS-CoV was
sufficient to induce the DMV formation26, we used AM580 to
treat the Huh7 cells co-transfected with nsp3 (~209 kDa) and
nsp4 (~57 kDa) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 6f, no significant
changes were detected in the expression levels of both viral
proteins. The finding indicated that the reduced DMV formation
was caused by the inhibition of lipogenesis directly and not by the
decreased viral replication indirectly.
Negative-sense RNA viruses, such as influenza A viruses, utilize
a different mechanism of genome replication and transcription
that
is
independent
of
intracellular
replicative
organelles.
Palmitoylation, a downstream consequence of fatty acid synthesis,
is a post-translational modification that modulates protein
function and protein localization. In the context of influenza A
viruses, the best characterized palmitoylated protein is the surface
glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA)27. Therefore, we explored
whether blockade of fatty acid synthesis would impede influenza
HA
palmitoylation
and
inhibit
H1N1
replication.
HA-
overexpressed A549 cells were cultured with AM580 or vehicle
(DMSO) or the positive control inhibitor 2-BP, which is specific
against protein palmitoylation28. Palmitoylated HA protein was
purified via resin-assisted capture. Strikingly, reduced levels of
palmitoylated HA were observed with the addition of 2-BP (56%)
and AM580 (69%) when compared with DMSO (100%) controls
(Fig. 6f). Moreover, 2-BP also showed inhibition against MERS-
CoV and H1N1 replication in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure 4b). To examine the specificity, oleic
acid, a downstream metabolite of palmitate was also used in the
complementation assays. The result showed that additional oleic
acid (100 µM) could not rescue the influenza A H1N1 virus
replication but indeed complement the viral growth of MERS-
CoV, ZIKV, and AdV5 (Fig. 6a, c, d). This finding suggested that
the palmitoylation of the viral HA was the main target of
influenza A H1N1 virus inhibition by AM580. Overall, using
DMV
formation
and
viral
protein palmitoylation
as
two
important
downstream
consequences
of
SREBPs-dependent
pathways, we demonstrated that the suppression of SREBPs-
dependent lipogenic transactivation reduced viral propagation
fitness by intervening the downstream fatty acid biosynthetic

Viruses rely on the metabolic network of their cellular hosts to
provide energy and building blocks for replication. Previous
studies on the viral perturbation of host lipid metabolism have
not been able to identify the underlying mechanism and host
factors targeted by the invading virus. The remarkable in vitro
and in vivo antiviral efficacy of the tool compound AM580,
through the inhibition of SREBP-related pathways, confirms that
up-regulation of host lipid biosynthesis is crucial in multiple

 aspects of viral life cycle and suggests that these aspects are vul-
nerable to antiviral intervention. SREBPs-mediated lipogenesis,
affecting the building of membrane blocks, energy supply, and
post-translational protein modification, is a complex process with
cross talks and compensatory mechanisms that influence propa-
gation of diverse groups of viruses (Fig. 7). Despite such com-
plexities, DNA-binding activity of n-SREBPs is a potentially
important target for therapeutic intervention against a broad
spectrum of pathogenic viruses.
Tang et al.22 previously reported that betulin inhibited
maturation of SREBP by inducing interaction of SREBP cleavage
activating protein (SCAP) and Insulin-induced gene protein
(Insig)22. Indeed, both betulin and a pre-SREBPs cleavage inhi-
bitor PF 429242 exhibited some inhibitory effect on MERS-CoV
replication at non-toxic concentrations (Supplementary Fig-
ure 4a). 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a cholesterol metabolite
inhibiting infection by a broad range of pathogenic viruses, works
indirectly through a 25HC sensor protein to elicit SCAP-Insig
binding29,30. While AM580 acts differently from the above
inhibitors, these studies supports that proteolytic processing of
SREBPs may also be a feasible target for broad-spectrum antiviral
therapy. Similar to these studies, the use of cancer cell lines which
usually underwent complex genetic and metabolic rearrangement
may affect the interpretation of results31. In addition, usage of

Fig. 6 Suppressed SREBP-dependent pathways reduced virus replication. a Inhibition the fatty acid synthesis reduced virus replication, while exogenous
palmitate or oleic acid rescued MERS-CoV replication. Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV (0.01 MOI) were treated with DMSO, or C75 (FAS inhibitor), or
AM580 in the absence (white bars) or presence of supplemental exogenous palmitate (black bars) or oleic acid (red bars). Viral titers in culture
supernatants after 24 hpi are shown. Differences between groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA test. b–d Virus rescue assays were performed for
H1N1 virus (0.001 MOI), EV-A71 (0.001 MOI), and human AdV5 (100TCID50) in different cell lines as described in a. Viral titer for different viruses were
analyzed by Students’ t-test. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. The experiments were performed in triplicate and replicated twice for confirmation. The results are
shown as mean ± s.d. e AM580 inhibited DMVs formation. Vero cells were infected with 3 MOI of MERS-CoV and treated with DMSO or AM580 for
another 12 h before processing for the staining before transmission electron microscopy. Virus-infected cells without treatment showed perinuclear
clusters of DMVs (red box) and the lack of DMVs production upon AM580 treatment. Representative electron microscopy images were selected from a
pool of over 30 images captured in two separate experiments. Scale bar of upper panel: 1 µm, lower panel: 200 nm. f AM580 did not affect viral protein
expression of nsp3 and nsp4. Huh7 cells were co-transfected with MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 with flag tag, and treated with AM580 at 6 h post-
transfection for another 24 h. Protein expression level was evaluated by western blot using β-actin as an internal control. g AM580 reduced viral protein
palmitoylation. A549 cells were transfected with HA plasmid of H1N1 virus. Drug treatment with DMSO (0.1%), 5 µM 2-BP (positive control inhibitor), or
20 µM AM580 was carried out post-transfection, while cell lysates were harvested 24 h later. Total HA (input) and palmitoylated HA of different groups
were analyzed using western blot. In all assays above, AM580 (20 µM) was added after virus absorption and maintained in the cell culture medium

 odd carbon chain glycerophospholipid internal standards such as
PC (12:0/13:0), PE (17:0/17:0)), PG (17:0/17:0), and addition of
such standards directly to biological samples before lipid extrac-
tion would be more equitable and be used in the future lipidomic
sample preparation32.
The importance of SREBP regulatory pathway has been
implicated in the life cycle of hantavirus which is dependent on
lipid synthesis for virus entry and membrane fusion process33,34.
This is also exemplified by the pharmacological inhibition of FAS
by C75 or Cerulenin that impaired the replication of a broad-
spectrum of viruses. Specifically, HCMV and influenza A virus
infections may require fatty acid synthesis to modulate membrane
composition for viral budding or protein modifications35. Direct
inhibition of FAS reduces infectivity of respiratory syncytial virus
and human rhinovirus serotype 16 by changing the membrane
components of the virion progeny particles. DENV NS3 recruits
FAS to sites of replication and stimulates fatty acid synthesis36.
Distinct from those studies, our work underscores the indis-
pensability of SREBP-mediated fatty acid synthesis to multiple
post-virus-entry events, particularly for the emerging infectious
viruses such as MERS-CoV and Influenza A virus. As examples,
reduced DMV formation and viral protein palmitoylation are two
important consequences of SREBP-controlled fatty acid synthesis
inhibition (Fig. 6e, g). Studies on other viral replication processes
related to SREBP-mediated downstream pathways are warranted.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that the inhibition of diverse
viruses, including enveloped (MERS-CoV, H1N1) and non-
enveloped (EV-A71) RNA, and DNA (AdV5) viruses, could be
partially rescued by exogenously supplied palmitate and to dif-
ferent extents (Fig. 6a, d). These results also support the
requirement of de novo fatty acid synthesis for optimal viral
replication. Moreover, transcriptional inactivation of lipogenic
enzymes, in addition to FAS, may impair virus replication
through diverse pathways in virus-specific manners (Fig. 7).
An unexpected result of the study is that antiviral activity of
AM580 is neither dependent on the RAR-α pathway (Supple-
mentary Figure 6a–c), nor on the activation of host innate
immune response (Supplementary Figure 6d, e). Possible “off-
target” effects of AM580 leading to its broad antiviral activity
cannot be excluded as the compound was long known to be an
RAR-α agonist. Moreover, a small-molecule compound can be a
multi-target binder due to its intrinsic structural features, while
the elicited biological responses through one of the ligand-target
interactions found presently may not necessarily account for the
observed antiviral activity. Although teratogenic effects of
AM580, as a pro-differentiation agonist and not a cytotoxic, have
been reported in mouse models37, the anticipated therapeutic
benefits outweigh its side effect when considering the short
duration of 3-day treatment by AM580 in the animal experi-
ments. In exploring AM580 analogs with comparable potency
and improved bioavailability, tamibarotene38, an orally active
retinoid for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia was
identified (Supplementary Table 1). Tamibarotene has a known
safety profile and is marketed in Japan. With the clinical
experience of tamibarotene, we believe AM580-related com-
pounds could be modified as a safe and broad group of antiviral
therapeutic
compounds. Overall, by targeting the SREBP-
associated lipid biosynthetic pathways, we demonstrate that the
lipidomic reprogramming of host cells by various viruses exposes
vulnerable targets for therapeutic intervention.

experiments. Uncropped western blottings are provided in Supplementary Figure 8.
Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-guinea pig IgG (H + L) antibody (Invitrogen, A-11073,
1:500) was utilized as a secondary antibody for immunofluorescence staining.
Silencer Select human SREBP1 siRNA, Silencer Select human SREBP2 siRNA, and
Silencer Select siRNA negative control were obtained from Life Technologies.
Nuclear extraction was performed using commercial kit (Abcam) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. SREBP1 transcription factor assay kit and SREBP2
transcription factor assay kit from Abcam were used for determination of SRE
binding activity, respectively. Badrilla (Leeds, UK) kits were used for purification of
palmitoylated proteins.
Transcriptome analysis. Calu-3 cells were mock infected or infected with MERS-
CoV at 2 MOI and incubated in DMEM medium. At 24 hpi, total cellular RNAs of
virus-infected or non-infected groups (n = 3) were collected. Gene expression
following MERS-CoV infection was analyzed using RNA-Seq technology43.
Sequencing libraries were constructed and sequenced by Beijing Genomics Institute
(BGI), averagely generating 23,977,722 clean reads after filtering the low quality.
Clean reads were mapped to reference sequences using HISAT/Bowtie2 (refs. 44,45).
The DEGs in MERS-CoV-infected samples were submitted to DAVID server for
pathway enrichment and cluster analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment ana-
lysis of DEGs was implemented using the GOseq R package46. KOBAS software
was used to examine the statistical enrichment of DEGS in The Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways47.
Lipidome analysis. Calu-3 cells were mock infected or infected with MERS-CoV at
2 MOI and incubated in DMEM medium. At 24 hpi, cells were collected for cellular
lipid extraction. Inactivation of virus infectivity was confirmed before further
processing using TCID50 assay48.
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) grade water, methanol,
and acetonitrile were purchased from J.T. Baker (Center Valley, PA, USA). HPLC-
grade chloroform was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Analytical
grade acetic acid and commercial standards used for biomarker identification were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). Internal standards (IS) including
Arachidonic acid-d8, 15(S)-HETE-d8, Leukotriene-B4-d4, and Lyso-Platelet-
activating Factor C16-d4 (PAF C-16-d4) were purchased from Cayman (Cayman
Chemical, USA).
The sample preparation was performed with minor modifications according to
the Mplex method49,50. Medium was removed from infected cells at 24 hpi and the
cells were immediately washed twice with ice-cooled quenching buffer consisted of
60% methanol and 0.85% ammonium bicarbonate in water. After removing the
quenching buffer, 500 µl of ice-cold 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution was
added to dissociate cells. The cells were then scraped and transferred into 15 ml
tubes (Nunc, Thermo Fisher, USA) on ice. Fifty microliters of the cell suspension
was removed for DNA extraction to perform cell count normalization. A genomic
DNA mini-kit (QIAGEN, Germany) was used for all DNA extractions. Then 2 ml
of lipid extraction solution (−20 °C chloroform/methanol; 2:1, v/v) containing IS
was added to the tubes. A 100 μl aliquot of the mixed solution was removed for the
confirmation of sterility by infectivity assay after lipid extraction. The remaining
solution was centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the bottom phase was
transferred to a glass vial. All vials were then removed from BSC and BSL
containment laboratory after appropriate disinfection and dried by a vacuum
concentrator. The dried samples were reconstituted in 300 µl solvent mixture
containing chloroform/methanol (v/v 2:1). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for
10 min at 4 °C, supernatants were transferred to LC vial for LC-MS analysis.
The cell lipid extract was analyzed using an Acquity UPLC system coupled to a
Synapt G2-HDMS mass spectrometer system (Waters Corp., MA, USA). The
chromatography was performed on a Waters ACQUITY BEH C18 column (1.7μm,
2.1 × 100 mm, I.D., 1.7 mm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The mobile phase
consisted of (A) 0.1% acetic acid in water and (B) acetonitrile. The separation was
performed at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min under a gradient program as follows: 0.5% B
(0–1.5 min), 0.5–8% B (1.5–2 min), 8–35% B (2–7 min), 35–70% B (7–13 min),
70–99.5% B (13–29 min), 99.5% B (29–36 min). In order to achieve rapid
equivalence, the flow rate was changed to 0.5 ml/min after 36 min and the
subsequent gradient program was applied as follows: 99.5% B (36–36.1 min), 99.5
to 0.5% B (36.1–38.1 min), 0.5% B (38.1–40 min). The column and auto-sampler
temperature were maintained at 45 °C and 10 °C, respectively. The injection
volume was 8 µl.
The mass spectral data were acquired in both positive and negative modes. The
capillary voltage, sampling cone voltage, and source offset were maintained at 2.5
kV, 60 V, and 60 V, respectively. Nitrogen was used as desolvation gas at a flow rate
of 800 l/h. The source and desolvation temperatures were maintained at 120 °C and
400 °C, respectively. Mass spectra were acquired over the m/z range of 50–1200.
The SYNAPT G2-Si HDMS system was calibrated using sodium format clusters
and operated in sensitivity mode. Leucine enkephalin was used as a lock mass for
all experiments. The MS data acquired mode are MSE for lipids profile and MS/MS
acquisition was operated in the same parameter as in MS acquisition for lipids
identification. Collision energy was used with the range from 20 to 40 eV for
fragmentation to allow putative identification and structural elucidation of the
significant lipids.
Acquisition of the raw data was performed using MassLynx software version 4.1
(Waters Corp., MA, USA) and these raw data were firstly converted into the
Analysis Base File (ABF) format. Then converted data were subsequently
deconvolved into mass feature (MF) list using the MS-DIAL software (http://prime.
psc.riken.jp/, version 2.46)51,52. Processed data were then exported as a text file for
further statistical analysis. The total ion intensities of all MFs in the MS-DIAL
report file for each sample were normalized by the corresponding DNA
concentration to calibrate for cell count variations53. MetaboAnalyst 4.0 (http://
www.metaboanalyst.ca) was used for univariate and multivariate statistical analysis
for the normalized MFs subjected to the Pareto scaling method54. For univariate
analysis, statistical significance of features was determined among the mock,
MERS-CoV infected, and AM580-treatment groups using the Student’s t-test,
respectively. The p-value <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant
features. For multivariate analysis, orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant
analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed as a supervised method to find important
variables with discriminative power and the model was evaluated with the relevant
R2 and Q2.
The protocol of lipid identification was carried out according to published
procedure51,55. The statistically significant features were given annotation names by
MS-DIAL once the MS features could match internal library criterion. MFs with
significant abundance were selected for MS/MS experiment and analysis. All
putative lipids were identified by using exact molecular weights, nitrogen rule, MS2
fragment, and literature/database searches including METLIN database (http://
metlin.scripps.edu/), Human Metabolome Database (http://www.hmdb.ca/),
LipidMaps (http://www.lipidmaps.org/), and KEGG database (http://www.genome.
jp/kegg). For final confirmation of lipids identity using authentic chemical
standard, MS/MS fragmentation pattern of the chemical standard was compared
with that of candidate lipids under the same LC-MS condition.
Integrative omics study. The joint lipidomic and transcriptomic analysis was
done by MetaboAnalyst (version 4.0)56, which enabled simultaneously mapping of
upregulated genes and changed lipid after MERS-CoV infection.
Lipid library screening. The library with 189 compounds (Cayman Chemical,
Michigan, USA), including prostaglandins, receptor agonists and antagonists, and
ceramide derivatives, which is ideal for G protein-coupled receptor screening, was
used for pharmacological screening. An MTT-based CPE inhibition assay was
performed to identify compounds that could protect cells from virus infection57.
To identify anti-MERS-CoV inhibitors, confluent Huh7 cells in 96-well culture
plates (4 × 104 cells/well) in triplicates were infected with MERS-CoV at 0.1 MOI.
One hour after virus absorption, the inoculum was removed, followed by addition
of drug-containing medium (10 µM). Twenty-four hours later, 10 μl of 5 mg/ml
MTT solution (Sigma) were added to the wells. The monolayers were incubated for
4 h. Finally, 100 μl of 10% SDS with 0.01 M HCl was added and samples were
further incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 overnight. Color changes
were read at OD570 with a reference wavelength at OD640. To screen anti-H1N1
inhibitors, MDCK cells were infected with H1N1 at 0.01 MOI, with cell viability
scored at 48 hpi; other procedures were the same as for anti-MERS-CoV screening.
Remdesivir (5 μM)58 and Favipiravir (50 μg/ml)59 were used as a positive control
for MERS-CoV and H1N1, respectively. Next, a dose–response analysis using
PRA60 was performed to evaluate the in vitro antiviral efficacies of the primary hits,
in which individual compound was serially diluted (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, and 0.625 μM)
and tested for either anti-MERS-CoV or anti-H1N1 activity.
Selectivity index. Selectivity index (SI) of the compound was calculated as the
ratio of 50% cellular cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) over 50% inhibitory con-
centration (IC50). CC50 value was determined with an MTT assay and by CellTiter-
Glo assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. IC50 data were
obtained with PRA or by viral load reduction assay as indicated61. Both CC50 and
IC50 were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7.
Flow cytometry. For intracellular staining, cells were detached with 10 mM EDTA
in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100
in PBS. Immunostaining for flow cytometry was performed following standard
procedures62. Flow cytometry was performed using a BD FACSCanto II flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed using FlowJo vX (Tree Star).
The gating strategy is provided in Supplementary Figure 9.
Human intestinal organoid culture and virus infection. Intestinal organoids
(intestinoids) were then cultured and differentiated for MERS-CoV infection by Ex
vivo culture technology18. An inoculum of 105 PFU of MERS-CoV was used to
infect one droplet of intestinoids, with an estimated MOI of 0.1. After the inoculum
was removed, the virus-inoculated intestinoids were rinsed with PBS and then re-
embedded in Matrigel and cultured in a 48-well plate with culture medium

 containing or lacking AM580 (20 μM). At indicated time points, intestinoids were
harvested for the quantification of intracellular viral load, whereas the cell-free
Matrigel and culture medium were combined for viral titration of extracellular
virions using a standard plaque assay.
Mouse experiments. MERS-CoV and H7N9 virus were tested in hDDP4 Tg
mice18 and BALB/c mice20, respectively. To examine the anti-MERS-CoV activity
of AM580, a total of 56 mice (28mice/group) were evaluated. After anesthesia, mice
were intranasally (i.n.) inoculated with 20 μl of virus suspension containing 50 PFU
of MERS-CoV. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) therapeutic treatments were initiated 6 h post-
virus-challenge. One group of mice was inoculated with 200 μl of AM580 i.p. for
3 days (12.5 mg/kg/day). The untreated control group of mice was administered
200 μl 0.1% DMSO in PBS i.p. Animal survival and clinical disease were monitored
for 14 days or until death. Four mice in each group were euthanized randomly on
day 2 and 4 post-challenge, respectively. Mouse lungs and brains were collected for
virus titration and H&E histopathologic analyses20. To evaluate the anti-influenza
virus potency of AM580 in vivo, BALB/c mice (18 mice/group) were inoculated i.n.
with 100 PFU of H7N9 virus in 20 μl. Treatment was initiated 6 h post-virus
challenge by i.n. administration. One group of mice was inoculated with 20 μl of i.
n. AM580 (1 mg/kg/day). A second group was treated with 20 μl of i.n. zanamivir
(2 mg/kg/day) as a positive control. A third group was given i.n. 0.1% DMSO in
PBS as an untreated control. Two i.n. doses per day of AM580, zanamivir, or
DMSO were administered for 3 days (total 6 doses/mouse). Animal survival and
clinical disease were monitored for 14 days or until death. Lung tissues (4 mice/
group) were collected for viral load detection and H&E histopathologic analyses on
days 3 and 6 post-virus-challenge, respectively.
Molecular docking. The crystal structures of SREBP1 (PDB code: 1AM9) and
SREBP2 (PDB code: 1UKL) were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank database.
SREBP1 dimer and SREBP2 dimer were separated with Pymol. Missing residues in
SREBP2 were modeled using I-TASSER server63. Protein models were prepared
with the Protein Preparation Wizard module in Maestro64. The 3D conformer of
AM580 was downloaded from PubChem database65. Leadfinder v 1.81 was used to
perform the docking simulation with extra precision method66. Alignment of the
amino acid sequence was performed using Vector NTI (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Chemical synthesis. Azido-AM580 was used for intracellular visualization of
AM580, while AM580dp was designed and synthesized for pull-down of AM580
binding targets. To synthesize azido-AM580, 20 mg of AM580 was mixed with
3.14 ml of azido-PEG5-amine (10 mg/ml) dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF).
Next, 40 mg of 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyr-
idinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate, 50 μl of N,N-diisopropylethylamine
(DIPEA), and 2.46 ml of dichloromethane were added to a final volume 5.7 ml.
Reactions were performed at room temperature with shaking. After overnight
incubation, the reaction mixture was lyophilized to remove solvent. Azido-AM580
was purified by HPLC and m/z 640 was detected by mass spectrometry (MS). Final
yield was quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). To synthesize
AM580dp, the purified azido-AM580 was linked with an amine reactive tri-
functional crosslinker (2-[N2-[Nα-Benzoylbenzoicamido-N6-6-biotinamidoca-
proyl]lysinylamido]ethyl-2′-(N sulfosuccinimidylcarboxy)ethyl disulfide sodium
salt (Santa Cruz), which was a biotin-UV activating-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-
ester compound. This tri-functional crosslinker contains a NHS-ester head group
for linking to the amine tail of another crosslinker phosphine compound methyl 4-
[2-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]ethylcarbamoyl]-2-diphenylphosphanyl-benzoate
(Shinsei Chemical Company Ltd), a biotin head group for Streptavidin binding on
the other end, and a UV activating benzophenone group for crosslinking with
target binding proteins of AM580. Specifically, 1 mg of tri-functional linker com-
pound was mixed with 30 μl of 74.8 mM crosslinker phosphine compound (dis-
solved in DMSO-d6) to a final volume of 1 ml by DMF. The molar ratio of these
compounds was 1:2. The reaction was performed at 40 °C with shaking at 1400
rpm. Excess azido-AM580 was added to this mixture to allow crosslinking with the
phosphine group by Staudinger ligation reaction. The reaction product was then
incubated with Streptavidin agarose resin (Pierce) to capture the AM580dp
product.
Electron microscopy. Electron microscopy was utilized to observe DMVs induced
by MERS-CoV infection. Vero cells were grown in six-well plates. Following
infection with MERS-CoV at 3 MOI for 1 h, the cell culture medium was replaced
with fresh medium containing 20 μM AM580 or 0.1% DMSO as a control. After 12
h, the cell culture medium was removed. The cells were washed with PBS, tryp-
sinized, and fixed with glutaraldehyde for further processing and counterstaining67.
The images were acquired in a Philips CM100 Transmission Electron Microscope
located in Electron Microscope Unit of the University of Hong Kong.
Statistics. As indicated in the figure legends, each experiment was performed
independently at least three times. For each experiment using samples collected
from mice, a whole experimental set used for different treatments was harvested
from a single animal. Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism
(version 7.0). Error bars indicated standard deviations. P-values were calculated
using either the Students’ t-test, or one-way ANOVA, or Log-rank (Mantel–Cox)
test as indicated. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
Study approval and biosafety measures. The major usage of experimental
models and subjects involved in this study was to evaluate the broad-spectrum
antiviral effects of AM580 in multiple cell lines, mouse models, human primary
cells, and organoid systems. Under the protocol approved by the Institutional
Review Board of The University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong
West Cluster, normal small intestine tissue from a patient was obtained surgically,
and human peripheral blood macrophages (MDMs) were isolated from healthy
blood donors at Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. Informed
consent was obtained from all human participants and the experiments were
performed in compliance with the approved standard operating procedures.
Human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) transgenic C57BL/6 mice (male and
female) and BALB/c female mice were kept in biosafety level 3 housing and given
access to standard pellet feed and water ad libitum. All experimental protocols were
approved by the Animal Ethics Committee in the University of Hong Kong and
were performed according to the standard operating procedures of the biosafety
level 3 animal facilities. All experiments with live viruses were conducted using
biosafety level 2 or 3 facilities20. The CULATR follows Hong Kong legislation and
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care Inter-
national recommended standards/guidelines (http://www.aaalac.org/about/ guide-
lines. cfm).
