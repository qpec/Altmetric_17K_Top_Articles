IMPORTANCE Although non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are
increasingly used to prevent thromboembolic disease, there are limited data on
NOAC-related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
OBJECTIVE To assess the association between preceding oral anticoagulant use
(warfarin, NOACs, and no oral anticoagulants [OACs]) and in-hospital mortality among
patients with ICH.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of 141 311 patients
with ICH admitted from October 2013 to December 2016 to 1662 Get With
The Guidelines–Stroke hospitals.
EXPOSURES Anticoagulation therapy before ICH, defined as any use of OACs within 7 days
prior to hospital arrival.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In-hospital mortality.
RESULTS Among 141 311 patients with ICH (mean [SD] age, 68.3 [15.3] years;
48.1% women), 15 036 (10.6%) were taking warfarin and 4918 (3.5%) were taking NOACs
preceding ICH, and 39 585 (28.0%) and 5783 (4.1%) were taking concomitant single and dual
antiplatelet agents, respectively. Patients with prior use of warfarin or NOACs were older and
had higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and prior stroke. Acute ICH stroke severity
(measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) was not significantly different
across the 3 groups (median, 9 [interquartile range, 2-21] for warfarin, 8 [2-20] for NOACs,
and 8 [2-19] for no OACs). The unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were 32.6% for warfarin,
26.5% for NOACs, and 22.5% for no OACs. Compared with patients without prior use of
OACs, the risk of in-hospital mortality was higher among patients with prior use of warfarin
(adjusted risk difference [ARD], 9.0% [97.5% CI, 7.9% to 10.1%]; adjusted odds ratio [AOR],
1.62 [97.5% CI, 1.53 to 1.71]) and higher among patients with prior use of NOACs (ARD, 3.3%
[97.5% CI, 1.7% to 4.8%]; AOR, 1.21 [97.5% CI, 1.11-1.32]). Compared with patients with prior
use of warfarin, patients with prior use of NOACs had a lower risk of in-hospital mortality
(ARD, −5.7% [97.5% CI, −7.3% to −4.2%]; AOR, 0.75 [97.5% CI, 0.69 to 0.81]). The difference
in mortality between NOAC-treated patients and warfarin-treated patients was numerically
greater among patients with prior use of dual antiplatelet agents (32.7% vs 47.1%;
ARD, −15.0% [95.5% CI, −26.3% to −3.8%]; AOR, 0.50 [97.5% CI, 0.29 to 0.86]) than
among those taking these agents without prior antiplatelet therapy (26.4% vs 31.7%;
ARD, −5.0% [97.5% CI, −6.8% to −3.2%]; AOR, 0.77 [97.5% CI, 0.70 to 0.85]), although
the interaction P value (.07) was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with ICH, prior use of NOACs or warfarin was
associated with higher in-hospital mortality compared with no OACs. Prior use of NOACs,
compared with prior use of warfarin, was associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality.

 N
on–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs)
are increasingly used as alternatives to warfarin to
prevent thromboembolic complications in high-risk
patients with atrial fibrillation.1,2 Although NOACs have a
more favorable safety profile than warfarin, the annual risk of
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) among NOAC-treated pa-
tients is 0.5%.3-6 Prior studies regarding the outcomes of ICH
among patients taking NOAC therapy are limited in size and
scope.7-9 With the rapid adoption of NOACs in clinical prac-
tice, there is a need to better understand the outcomes among
patients who develop an ICH with prior NOAC therapy com-
pared with those experiencing ICH either with prior warfarin
therapy or among those without prior oral anticoagulation.
The goals of the study were to evaluate the characteris-
tics and clinical outcomes in patients who experienced an ICH
with preceding use of NOACs compared with no oral antico-
agulants (OACs) and warfarin, and to determine the incremen-
tal risk of mortality and disability associated with the con-
comitant prior use of OACs and antiplatelet therapy according
to the type of anticoagulants.
Methods
Data Source
This retrospective cohort study used data from the American
Heart Association/American Stroke Association Get With
The Guidelines–Stroke (GTWG-Stroke), which is an ongoing,
voluntary, continuous registry sponsored by the American
Heart Association/American Stroke Association. Details of
GWTG-Stroke registry data collection and variable definitions
have been previously described.10 Standardized data collec-
tion includes patient demographic information, medical
history, diagnostic testing, brain imaging, in-hospital treat-
ment, and outcomes. The validity and reliability of data col-
lection in GWTG-Stroke have been reported in previous
research.11 Quintiles serves as the data collection and coordi-
nation center for GWTG-Stroke. The Duke Clinical Research
Institute serves as the data analysis center and has an agree-
ment to analyze the aggregate deidentified data for re-
search purposes. Each participating hospital received either
human research approval to enroll patients without indi-
vidual patient consent under the Common Rule or a waiver of
authorization and exemption from subsequent review by
their institutional review board. This study was approved by
the institutional review board of Duke University.
Study Population
All patients with a diagnosis of ICH were identified in the
GWTG-Stroke registry database between October 2013 and
December 2016. Preceding use of OACs or antiplatelet
therapy was recorded as part of routine care and defined as
any use within 7 days prior to hospital arrival. For the pur-
pose of the study, preceding anticoagulation treatments were
categorized into 3 mutually exclusive groups: (1) warfarin;
(2) NOACs; and (3) no OACs (Figure 1). NOACs were defined as
the preceding use of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or
edoxaban. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they
were taking 2 or more anticoagulant agents (both NOACs and
warfarin, or NOAC or warfarin with other anticoagulants such
as heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin).
Antiplatelet treatments were classified into 3 categories:
(1) no antiplatelet therapy, (2) single antiplatelet therapy
(SAPT); and (3) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (Figure 1).
SAPT was defined as any one of the following antiplatelet
agents prior to ICH: aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasug-
rel, or ticagrelor. DAPT was defined as aspirin/dipyridamole,
aspirin plus aspirin/dipyridamole, aspirin plus clopidogrel,
ticlopidine, prasugrel, or ticagrelor. Patients who were not
in any of these 3 antiplatelet groups were excluded from
the analysis.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality (yes or no).
The exploratory outcomes included discharge disposition
(home vs other), in-hospital mortality or discharge to hos-
pice, ambulatory status at discharge (able to ambulate inde-
pendently vs not), and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at
discharge (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). Patients with
an mRS score of 0 or 1 were classified as having excellent re-
covery, and those with an mRS score of 0 to 2 were classified
as having functional independence.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics were compared across 3 preceding an-
ticoagulation treatment groups. Medians with interquartile
ranges were calculated for continuous variables in each group
and compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical vari-
ables were reported as counts and percentages, and differ-
ences among groups were assessed using the χ2 test.
Multivariable logistic regression models were performed
to assess the relationship between preceding anticoagulation
therapies with each clinical outcome. These analyses ad-
justed for baseline demographic and clinical variables prior
to the index ICH event including demographics (age, sex, and
race/ethnicity [black, Hispanic, Asian, and other vs white:
admission staff, medical staff, or both recorded the patient’
s
self-reported race/ethnicity, usually during registration;
Key Points
Question What is the association between preceding oral
anticoagulant use (warfarin, non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants
[NOACs], and no oral anticoagulants) and in-hospital mortality
among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage?
Findings In this registry-based retrospective cohort study
including 141 311 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, prior use
of warfarin or NOACs, compared with no prior anticoagulant use,
was associated with higher in-hospital mortality, although the use
of NOACs, compared with warfarin, was associated with lower
in-hospital mortality risk (adjusted risk difference, −5.7%; adjusted
odds ratio, 0.75).
Meaning Among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, prior
use of NOACs, compared with prior use of warfarin, was associated
with lower risk of in-hospital mortality.

 prior studies have suggested differences in outcomes from
intracerebral hemorrhage related to race/ethnicity]), insur-
ance, medical history (atrial fibrillation/flutter, coronary
artery disease or prior myocardial infarction, carotid stenosis,
diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, smok-
ing, dyslipidemia, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack,
heart failure, drug or alcohol abuse, obesity or overweight,
and renal insufficiency), arrival and admission information
(emergency medical services arrival and transfer-in [vs pri-
vate transportation] and arrived off hours), medications at
admission (antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and diabetic
agents), and hospital characteristics (region, rural vs urban,
teaching hospital, number of beds, and certified primary
stroke center). All continuous variables were tested for lin-
earity and included in the model as a linear variable except
for age. A nonlinear relationship exists between in-hospital
death and age; therefore, splines with a cutoff point of age 70
years were used in the model. The preceding anticoagulation
treatment was included as an independent variable, with no
OACs or warfarin as the reference groups.
As a sensitivity analysis, the same analyses were repli-
cated in patients without preceding use of any antiplatelet
therapy. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were also per-
formed in patients with a National Institutes of Health Stroke
Scale (NIHSS) score on admission, with the model including
NIHSS score along with other covariates. NIHSS was used as
a measure of stroke severity (range, 0-42, with a higher score
indicating greater stroke severity), but it was not included in
the main model because a higher NIHSS score could be the re-
sult of hematoma expansion caused by NOACs or OACs and
controversies existed about whether NIHSS should be in-
cluded in the model. The generalized estimation equation
(GEE) modeling approach was used to account for within-
hospital clustering of patients. In addition, the GEE approach
using normal distribution with identity link was used for es-
timating unadjusted and adjusted risk differences.12,13
To evaluate the differences in the incremental risk of mor-
tality and disability with the concomitant prior antiplatelet
therapy according to underlying OAC, multivariable logistic re-
gression models with GEE were performed in each OAC group,
respectively, with antiplatelet treatment category (no anti-
platelet, SAPT, or DAPT) as the independent variable and no
antiplatelet as the reference group.
As a sensitivity analysis, multivariable logistic regression
models with GEE were performed to compare the in-hospital
mortality rate among patients with preceding use of NOACs
with that among patients with preceding use of warfarin in the
therapeutic range. Additionally, the association of interna-
tional normalized ratio (INR) level and outcomes was also
evaluated among patients with prior use of warfarin. For these
additional analyses, patients with prior use of warfarin were
classified into 3 categories based on admission INR level:
(1) subtherapeutic, defined as INR less than 2; (2) therapeu-
tic, with INR ranging from 2 to 3; and (3) supratherapeutic de-
fined as INR greater than 3.
All variables had less than 2% missing data except for
insurance (7.4%) and preadmission medications (18.1%
for antihypertensive and 21.8% for diabetic medications).
Details of missing values can be found in eTable 1 in the
Supplement. To account for missing data, single imputation
was used for each variable: men for sex, non-Hispanic white
for race/ethnicity, private transportation for emergency
medical services arrival and transfer in, and “no” for other.
All statistical analyses were performed by the Duke Clinical
Research Institute using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc). All P values were 2-sided. For the primary out-
come (in-hospital mortality), the Bonferroni correction
approach was used to account for multiple comparisons,
and P < .025 was considered statistically significant and
97.5% CIs instead of 95% CIs were reported. For other out-
comes, P < .05 was considered statistically significant and
95% CIs were reported.

 Results
A total of 152 293 patients with ICH were admitted to GWTG-
Stroke hospitals between October 2013 and December 2016.
Of these, 10 982 patients were excluded from the analyses for
the following reasons: (1) patients taking 3 or more antiplate-
let agents or 2 or more OACs (n = 2083); (2) ICH occurred
in the hospital (n = 1744); (3) missing discharge status, trans-
ferred out, or left against medical advice (n = 5259); and
(4) patients with a prosthetic heart valve (n = 1896) (Figure 1).
After these exclusions, the final study population included
141 311 patients from 1662 hospitals.
Among 141 311 patients with ICH (mean [SD] age, 68.3
[15.3] years; 48.1% women), 121 357 patients (85.9%) were
not receiving OACs prior to ICH, 15 036 (10.6%) were receiv-
ing warfarin, and 4918 (3.5%) were receiving NOACs. Among
patients with preceding use of NOACs, 11.0% were taking
dabigatran; 54.0%, rivaroxaban; 34.9%, apixaban; and 0.1%,
edoxaban. Patients with prior use of warfarin or NOACs
were more likely to have concomitant SAPT than those
not taking any OAC, whereas patients without preceding use
of OACs were more likely to have DAPT (SAPT: 32.3% for
warfarin, 30.5% for NOACs, and 27.4% for no OACs; DAPT:
2.6% for warfarin, 2.3% for NOACs, and 4.4% for no OACs)
(Table 1 and Figure 1). Baseline characteristics by OAC type
are shown in Table 1.
Patients with preceding use of warfarin or NOACs were
more likely to be older, white, and have a higher prev-
alence of atrial fibrillation, prior stroke or transient ischemic
attack, and atherosclerotic comorbidities (eg, coronary artery
disease, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and heart
failure). The severity of ICH at admission, as measured by
NIHSS, was not significantly different across the 3 groups
(median [interquartile range]: 9 [2-21], 8 [2-20], and 8
[2-19] for warfarin, NOACs, and no OACs, respectively). When
directly comparing patients with preceding use of warfarin
with those with preceding use of NOACs, the baseline charac-
teristics were not significantly different except for a higher
prevalence of renal disease in patients with prior use of war-
farin and a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients
with prior use of NOACs.
Preceding Anticoagulation Treatment
and Outcome Measures
The unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were 32.6% for
prior use of warfarin, 26.5% for prior use of NOACs, and
22.5% for no preceding use of OACs. After adjustment for
confounders, both prior use of warfarin (adjusted risk differ-
ence [ARD], 9.0% [97.5% CI, 7.9% to 10.1%]; adjusted odds
ratio [AOR], 1.62 [97.5% CI, 1.53 to 1.71]) and prior use of
NOACs (ARD, 3.3% [97.5% CI, 1.7% to 4.8%]; AOR, 1.21 [97.5%
CI, 1.11 to 1.32]) were associated with increased odds of
in-hospital mortality as compared with no prior use of OACs.
Compared with patients with prior use of warfarin, patients
with prior use of NOACs had a lower risk of in-hospital mor-
tality (ARD, −5.7% [97.5% CI, −7.3% to −4.2%]; AOR, 0.75
[97.5% CI, 0.69 to 0.81]) (Table 2). Ambulatory and functional
outcomes were not significantly different between patients
with prior use of NOACs vs no prior use of OACs, whereas
patients with prior use of NOACs were more likely to be dis-
charged home and have better functional outcomes at
discharge than those with prior use of warfarin (Table 2).
These findings were consistent when confined to patients
without preceding use of any antiplatelet agents (n = 95 943)
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). In addition, sensitivity analy-
ses in patients with NIHSS on admission (n = 90 223) also
were consistent with the main findings even after the further
adjustment with NIHSS score (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Incremental Risk of Mortality and Disability With
Concomitant Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Therapy
Baseline characteristics by number of antiplatelet agents are
shown in eTable 4 in the Supplement. Compared with
patients without prior use of antiplatelet therapy, patients
with prior use of antiplatelet therapy were older and had
higher burden of atherosclerotic comorbidities. In patients
with prior use of NOACs and no OACs, SAPT was not associ-
ated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. By con-
trast, in patients with prior use of warfarin, SAPT was asso-
ciated with a higher rate of in-hospital mortality (33.2% vs
31.7%; ARD, 3.2% [97.5% CI, 1.4% to 5.0%]; AOR, 1.17 [97.5%
CI, 1.07 to 1.28]) than no prior antiplatelet (Figure 2). The
preceding use of DAPT was associated with increased risk of
in-hospital mortality among patients with prior warfarin use
(ARD, 16.5% [97.5% CI, 10.9% to 22.2%]; AOR, 2.13 [97.5%
CI, 1.66 to 2.73]) and with no prior OAC use (ARD, 7.3%
[97.5% CI, 5.7% to 8.9%]; AOR, 1.50 [97.5% CI, 1.38 to 1.64]).
Nevertheless, these differences were not statistically sig-
nificant among patients with prior use of NOACs (ARD, 7.0%
[97.5% CI, −2.9% to 16.8%]; AOR, 1.41 [97.5% CI, 0.87 to
2.28]) (Figure 2).
For ambulatory and functional outcomes, patients with
prior use of DAPT were less likely to be discharged home than
those without any prior use of antiplatelet agents among pa-
tients with prior use of no OAC, but there was no difference in
patients with prior use of warfarin or NOACs. When directly
compared with prior use of warfarin, patients with prior use
of NOACs had lower in-hospital mortality compared with pa-
tients with prior use of warfarin regardless of antiplatelet
therapy, and the difference in mortality between patients with
prior use of NOACs vs prior use of warfarin was numerically
greateramongpatientswithprioruseofdualantiplateletagents
(32.7% vs 47.1%; ARD, −15.0% [97.5% CI, −26.3% to −3.8%];
AOR, 0.50 [97.5% CI, 0.29 to 0.86]) than among those with-
out prior antiplatelet therapy (26.4% vs 31.7%; ARD, −5.0%
[97.5%CI,−6.8%to−3.2%];AOR,0.77[97.5%CI,0.70to0.85]),
although the P value of interaction (.07) was not statistically
significant (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Comparison of Outcomes in NOAC- vs Warfarin-Treated
Patients With Therapeutic Range of INR
There was a dose-response relationship between INR and
outcomes in patients with prior use of warfarin who ex-
perienced an ICH. The unadjusted in-hospital mortality
rates were 25.0% for those with prior use of warfarin with

 subtherapeutic INR, 32.4% for therapeutic INR, and 37.9% for
supratherapeutic INR (Table 3). This dose-response relation-
ship was similar even after adjusting for measured confound-
ers (eTable 6 in the Supplement). The in-hospital mortality
rate in patients with prior use of NOACs (26.5%) was signifi-
cantly lower than among patients with prior use of warfarin
with therapeutic INR (33.4%) (ARD, −6.1% [97.5% CI, −8.2%
to −4.0%]; AOR, 0.73 [97.5% CI, 0.66 to 0.81]) or suprathera-
peutic INR (39.2%) (ARD, −12.0% [97.5% CI, −14.7% to
−9.4%]; AOR, 0.56 [97.5% CI, 0.49 to 0.63]), although there
was no significant difference compared with patients with
prior warfarin treatment with subtherapeutic INR (Table 3).
These findings were consistent when confined to patients
without prior use of concomitant antiplatelet therapy.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the largest clinical experi-
ence with anticoagulation-related ICH. Of more than 141 000
ICH hospitalizations, 10.6% of patients were receiving warfa-
rin and 3.5% were receiving NOACs prior to ICH. While both
prior use of warfarin and prior use of NOACs were associated
with the increased odds of mortality compared with no prior
use of OACs, patients with prior use of NOACs compared with
those with prior use of warfarin were more likely to have fa-
vorable outcomes in terms of in-hospital mortality and dis-
ability.Moreover,prioruseofconcomitantantiplatelettherapy
was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality
among patients with preceding warfarin therapy, but such sig-
nificant differences were not observed among patients with
preceding NOAC therapy, likely because of the smaller sample
size of patients with prior NOAC use.
Prior studies have demonstrated that warfarin users
were at increased risk of ICH, and warfarin-associated ICH
was associated with larger hematoma volumes,14 higher rates
of hematoma expansion,15 and worse clinical outcomes as
compared with spontaneous ICH.16 Although randomized
clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of NOACs
with warfarin showed lower incidence of ICH in patients
receiving NOACs, there have been limited data regarding
the potential effect of preceding NOACs on ICH outcomes.
Two previous studies evaluated anticoagulation-related ICH
and found that mortality in NOAC-treated patients was
numerically lower than that in warfarin-treated patients;
however, the differences were not statistically significant,
which was likely due to the small number of ICH cases in the
NOAC groups (n = 97 and 101).17,18 Other studies with a lim-
ited number of cases suggested that smaller ICH volume,
lower likelihood of hematoma expansion, and better func-
tional outcomes occurred in patients taking NOACs compared
with warfarin.19-21
Unlike previous research, the current analysis included a
large contemporary cohort of ICH from 1662 US hospitals. This
study found that among these patients with ICH, prior use of
warfarin and prior use of NOACs were associated with in-
creased odds of in-hospital mortality compared with sponta-
neous ICH among patients not taking any OAC. Nonetheless,
preceding use of NOACs was associated with a decreased risk
of in-hospital mortality and better in-hospital outcomes than
precedinguseofwarfarin,andimportantly,thisassociationwas
consistent when patients with prior use of NOACs were com-
pared with patients with prior use of warfarin whose INR lev-
elswerecontrolledwithinthetherapeuticrange.Becausemany
of these patients should be taking OACs for prevention of
thromboembolic complications,22 these findings suggest
that NOACs may be a better option than warfarin, consider-
ing the lower mortality risk among patients with ICH with prior
use of NOACs. Furthermore, NOACs have been shown to be
cost-effective relative to warfarin despite the assumption that
outcomes after ICH would be identical regardless of OAC
types.23 The findings of this analysis further support the cost-
effectiveness of NOACs by showing that ICH outcomes are less
severe among patients with prior use of NOACs compared with
patients with prior use of warfarin.
In patients receiving OACs, concomitant use of antiplate-
let therapy was associated with a 3-fold increase in ICH (0.9%
vs 0.3%); therefore, a large portion of patients with ICH were

 taking both anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy prior to
stroke in this study and that of Shireman et al.24 Given the po-
tential risk of hematoma expansion, concomitant use of OACs
andantiplatelettherapymightaffecttheoutcomesofICH;how-
ever, few studies have evaluated the incremental risk of mor-
tality and disability in patients with ICH taking both antico-
agulantsandantiplateletagents,especiallyintheeraofNOACs.
A prior meta-analysis, which was conducted before the ad-
vent of NOACs, reported higher in-hospital mortality in pa-
tients with preceding use of antiplatelet therapy.25 Similarly,
a recent report from the GWTG-Stroke registry showed that pa-
tients with prior use of multiple antiplatelet agents, but not
SAPT, were at increased risk of in-hospital mortality.26 Yet in
these analyses, patients with concomitant use of OACs were
excluded and the incremental risk of antiplatelet therapy in
patients treated with OACs could not be evaluated.
In several clinical settings, patients are eligible for both an-
ticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies, such as patients with
atrial fibrillation who received recent percutaneous coronary
intervention. Particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation,
the combination of OAC and DAPT is considered required in
thosewhorequirecoronarystentimplantationupto6months,
depending on the individualized ischemic and bleeding
risks.27,28 Although warfarin and NOACs are recommended for
the combination strategy of antiplatelet and anticoagulation
therapies,27 a recent trial comparing 3 different antithrom-
botic strategies (low-dose rivaroxaban plus a P2Y12 inhibitor,
very-low-doserivaroxabanplusDAPT,andwarfarinplusDAPT)
demonstrated lower bleeding rates in the rivaroxaban strate-
gies than in the warfarin strategy, with similar efficacy.29-31
The current study found significantly increased odds of
in-hospital mortality among patients with prior warfarin

 and antiplatelet therapy, whereas such differences were not
observed in patients with prior NOAC treatment. Further-
more, the direct comparison between NOACs and warfarin
demonstrated that the lower in-hospital mortality among
patients with prior NOAC therapy was numerically more
prominent among patients with prior concomitant anti-
platelet therapy. While these findings are not conclusive
given the relatively small of number of patients with con-
comitant NOAC and antiplatelet therapy, they may support
the hypothesis that NOACs could be a reasonable choice
with better safety profiles when combination strategy is
required. The recently published Randomized Evaluation of
Dual Antithrombotic Therapy With Dabigatran vs Triple
Therapy With Warfarin in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial
Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Interven-
tion (RE-DUAL PCI) trial also confirmed this hypothesis.32
The major concern regarding NOACs is a lack of specific
reversal agents. Immediate management is necessary for
patients with life-threatening bleeding including ICH, and
appropriate reversal agents should be administered. Idaruci-
zumab, a specific antidote for dabigatran, is commercially
available in the United States,33 while a reversal agent for
factor Xa inhibitors, such as andexanet alfa, has not yet been
approved.34 In this study, more than half of patients with
ICH (63%) were admitted before the approval of idaruci-
zumab, but the preceding use of NOACs was associated with
lower odds of mortality and disability compared with prior
use of warfarin for which an established reversal strategy
could be applied.
The intensity of anticoagulation is predictive of out-
comes in warfarin-treated patients who experienced an ICH.
An evaluation of patients with supratentorial ICH suggested
that warfarin therapy increased the risk of mortality from
25.8% for patients not receiving warfarin to 52.0%, and the
risk increased further with higher INR levels.35 The result of
this study was consistent with this previous finding and addi-
tionally showed that supratherapeutic warfarin was associ-
ated with the increased risk of poor neurological outcome. In
clinical practice, maintaining INR within the therapeutic
range could be challenging. Even in the clinical trials compar-
ing warfarin with NOACs in terms of efficacy and safety, time
in therapeutic range went from only 55.2% to 64.9%.3-6
NOACs might be a better option in broader clinical situations,
given the risk of worse outcomes of ICH with supratherapeu-
tic INR (even with therapeutic INR) and the challenge in
achieving time in therapeutic range with warfarin.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, despite the use of
a large number of characteristics to adjust for potential con-
founding, residual or unmeasured confounding may exist
and it may be most prominent in terms of comparison with
the no OAC group. Because it is not feasible to randomize
patients with ICH to different antithrombotic regimens prior
to ICH, our observational findings provide important clini-
cal insights in the context of oral anticoagulation–related
ICH, especially in the era of NOACs. Second, the data were
obtained from hospitals participating in the GWTG-Stroke
program and may not be able to be extrapolated to patients
treated in hospitals outside the registry. Nonetheless, to our
knowledge, GWTG-Stroke is the largest stroke registry in the
United States, covering about three-fourths of the US popu-
lation. Furthermore, ICH tends to be concentrated at large
teaching hospitals. Given the higher representation of high-
volume and academic centers in GWTG-Stroke,36 the study
population of this investigation is potentially quite repre-
sentative of patients with ICH in the United States.
Third, despite the large sample size, in the analysis evalu-
ating the incremental risk of mortality and morbidity with
concomitant preceding use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant

 therapies, statistical power might be insufficient in patients
with prior use of NOACs. Fourth, timing of the last anticoagu-
lant or antiplatelet agents prior to ICH was not available. Also,
the dose of NOAC or antiplatelet agents was not recorded.
Patients with renal dysfunction or receiving concomitant
antiplatelet therapy may have been receiving a lower dose of
NOACs and, consequently, better outcomes. Fifth, OAC rever-
salstrategies,suchastheuseofvitaminK,freshfrozenplasma,
or intravenous factor concentrates, were not collected in the
database.IdarucizumabwasapprovedbytheUSFoodandDrug
Administration on October 19, 2015, but only 37.0% of pa-
tients taking NOACs were admitted after the approval date and
potentially eligible to receive idarucizumab.
Sixth, some patients were missing data on mRS at dis-
charge (43.7%), which could skew the results for this explor-
atory outcome; however, it is unlikely that physicians will
report ICH severity differently according to anticoagulation
type prior to admission. Seventh, in our database, ICH vol-
ume, hematoma expansion, and commonly used clinical
scores (eg, ICH score)37 were not available, yet these variables
are surrogate markers for predicting mortality and disability.
Because harder end points, such as in-hospital death, func-
tional outcomes represented by mRS at discharge, and dis-
charge disposition, were evaluated in our study, assessing
these surrogate markers may not provide additional insights.
In addition, given that greater ICH volume, greater hema-
toma expansion, and higher ICH score may be caused by the
preceding use of NOACs or warfarin resulting in the worse
clinical outcomes, including these variables in the models
would not be appropriate.
Conclusions
Among patients with ICH, prior use of NOACs or warfarin was
associated with higher in-hospital mortality compared with no
OACs. Prior use of NOACs, compared with prior use of warfa-
rin, was associated with lower risk of in-hospital mortality.
