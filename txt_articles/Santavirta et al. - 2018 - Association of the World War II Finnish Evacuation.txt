 Association of the World War II Finnish Evacuation of Children
With Psychiatric Hospitalization in the Next Generation

IMPORTANCE Although there is evidence that adverse childhood experiences are associated
with worse mental health in adulthood, scarce evidence is available regarding an emerging
concern that the next generation might also be affected.
OBJECTIVE To compare the risk of psychiatric hospitalization in cousins whose parents were
vs were not exposed to the Finnish evacuation policy that involved a mean 2-year stay with
a Swedish foster family.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multigenerational, population-based cohort study
of Finnish individuals and their siblings born between January 1, 1933, and December 31,
1944, analyzed the association of evacuee status as a child during World War II in the first
generation with the risk of psychiatric hospitalization among offspring in the second
generation. Evacuee status during World War II was determined using the Finnish National
Archive’
s registry of participants in the Finnish evacuation. Data on evacuee status were
linked to the psychiatric diagnoses in the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register from January 1,
1971, through December 31, 2012, for offspring (n = 93 391) born between January 1, 1950,
and December 31, 2010. Sex-specific Cox proportional hazards regression models were used
to estimate hazard ratios for risk of psychiatric hospitalization during the follow-up period.
Because offspring of evacuees and their nonevacuated siblings are cousins, the Cox
proportional hazards regression models included fixed effects to adjust for confounding
factors in families. Data analysis was performed from June 15, 2016, to August 26, 2017.
EXPOSURES Parental participation in the evacuation during World War II (coded 1 for parents
who were evacuated and placed in foster care and 0 for those not evacuated).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Offspring’
s initial admission to the hospital for a psychiatric
disorder, obtained from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register from January 1, 1971, through
December 31, 2012.
RESULTS Of the 93 391 study persons, 45 955 (49.2%) were women and 47 436 (50.8) were
men; mean (SD) age in 2012 among survivors was 45.4 (6.58) years. Female offspring of
mothers evacuated to Sweden during childhood had an elevated risk of psychiatric
hospitalization (hazard ratio for any type of psychiatric disorder: 2.04 [95% CI, 1.04-4.01];
hazard ratio for mood disorder: 4.68 [95% CI, 1.92-11.42]). There was no excess risk of being
hospitalized for a psychiatric disorder among women whose fathers were exposed to the
Finnish evacuation policy during World War II or among men whose mothers or fathers were
exposed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a prior follow-up study of the Finnish evacuees, girls
evacuated to Swedish foster families during World War II were more likely to be hospitalized
for a psychiatric disorder—in particular, a mood disorder—in adulthood than their
nonevacuated sisters. The present study found that the offspring of these individuals were
also at risk for mental health problems that required hospitalization and suggests that
early-life adversities, including war-related exposures, may be associated with mental health
disorders that persist across generations.

 E
arly childhood adversity has a substantial influence on
health, partly because it leads to deficits in children’
s
mental and physical development.1-4 In addition, early
childhood adversity has lasting influences on health in middle
and older adulthood because children exposed to adversity
have higher risks of adult mental health problems, chronic dis-
ease, and dysregulation of physiologic pathways, such as in-
flammation that increases risk for cardiovascular-related
conditions.5-8
One of the major sources of adversity experienced by
children globally arises from armed conflict.9-12 Children
exposed to armed conflict have elevated risks of mental
health disorders, including depression, posttraumatic stress
disorder, and alcohol use disorders, and have shorter life
expectancy.13-16
Given the scope of armed conflict and the evidence that
early childhood adversity has associations with mental health
that are only partly mitigated by later intervention,17,18 there
is an emerging concern that these associations might persist
into the next generation.19-21 Exposure to armed conflict dur-
ing childhood could have an enduring association with psy-
chological development that results in adverse parenting
styles in adulthood,22,23 selection into adverse adult environ-
ments, epigenetic changes that are transmitted to the next
generation,24 and, for women, alterations in pregnancy and
consequently fetal development.25,26 However, evidence of
suchintergenerationalassociations,particularlyinpopulation-
based studies, is limited. Scharf23 reported that the degree of
exposure to holocaust survivors in the family was associated
with worse psychosocial functioning, and Muhtz et al27 docu-
mented that offspring who reported being most burdened by
their parents’refugee history had higher scores on a scale of
mental symptoms. However, these were small studies that did
not have comparison groups of unexposed parents.
In a previous report28 on the outcomes of Finnish chil-
dren evacuated to Swedish foster families during World War
II,girls(butnotboys)evacuatedtoSwedenduringthewarwere
more than twice as likely to be hospitalized for a mood disor-
der during adulthood than their nonevacuated siblings, sup-
porting the aforementioned evidence of the long-term asso-
ciation of war exposure with mental health. To address the
concern about the intergenerational association of war expo-
sures with mental health, we investigated whether offspring
of the Finnish evacuees were more likely to be hospitalized for
a mental disorder than offspring of nonevacuees. Offspring of
evacuated and nonevacuated siblings are cousins; we there-
fore leverage the biological relationships between study par-
ticipantstomitigatetheconfoundinginfluencesofsharedfam-
ily vulnerability to poor mental health using a fixed-effects
design.29,30
Methods
This is a multigenerational, population-based cohort study
of Finnish individuals born from January 1, 1933, through
December 31, 1944, and their offspring born from January 1,
1950, through December 31, 2010, and for whom hospital-
ization data were available from January 1, 1971, through
December 31, 2012. To investigate the intergenerational
association of the Finnish evacuation policy during World
War II with psychiatric hospitalization, we conducted analy-
ses in which we associated evacuee status as a child during
World War II in the first generation with the risk of psychiat-
ric hospitalization among offspring in the second genera-
tion. Data analysis was performed from June 15, 2016 to
August 26, 2017. The study was approved by the Data Pro-
tection Board of Statistics Finland and the ethical commit-
tee of the National Institute of Health and Welfare, Finland.
According to Finnish law and the National Board of Health,
informed consent is not necessary in deidentified, register-
based research.
We selected all 71 788 participants from the World War II
generations born from January 1, 1933, through December
31, 1944, who were included in a 10% follow-up sample of
households from the 1950 Finnish census linked by Statis-
tics Finland to individual social security numbers (issued in
the late 1960s). We included in the analytic sample only par-
ticipants who had at least 1 sibling also born between 1933
and 1944, thus eliminating 19 738 singletons. After further
excluding those who had attrited from the sample before
the issuing of social security numbers because of death or
emigration (n = 4037) and those with a missing family iden-
tifier (n = 1136), our analytic sample of participants who
experienced World War II events as children consisted of
46 877 individuals.
Statistics Finland then identified the offspring of our ana-
lytic sample, resulting in 93 391 individuals born between
1950 and 2010. We could not ascertain offspring who had
died or emigrated before 1970. Of the 93 391 second-
generation participants, 2992 were offspring of parents who
as children had been evacuated from Finland to Sweden dur-
ing World War II, and 90 399 were offspring of parents who
remained in Finland throughout World War II (eFigure 1 in
the Supplement). Parental evacuation status was determined
by comparing their first and last names and exact birth date
with the Finnish National Archives registry of participants in
the Finnish evacuation policy, which covers the entire popu-
lation of child evacuees.
Key Points
Question What is the association of parental exposure to
unaccompanied evacuation as a result of the Finnish evacuation
policy during World War II with psychiatric risk in the next
generation?
Findings In this population-based cohort study, female (but not
male) offspring of mothers placed in Swedish foster families during
World War II had a significantly higher risk of hospitalization
attributable to mood disorders than their female cousins.
Meaning A childhood exposure that increased the risk of
psychiatric illness in adulthood was also associated with increased
risk of psychiatric illness in the next generation, indicating that the
psychiatric consequences of early adversity that are known to
persist into adulthood may be transmitted intergenerationally.

 Measures
Our main outcome of interest was initial admission to the hos-
pital for a psychiatric disorder between 1971 and 2012 based
on the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register (HDR). The regis-
ter contains information on the date of admission, discharge,
and diagnoses for all inpatient stays. We used primary and sub-
sidiary diagnosis codes from the eighth, ninth, and 10th revi-
sions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and
deaths (ICD codes provided in the eTable in the Supplement).
We investigated admissions for any psychiatric disorder and
substance use, psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders. The
HDR has satisfactory to high validity, with positive predictive
values for common diagnoses ranging from 75% to 98%.28
Dates of death were obtained from the death cause registry ad-
ministered by Statistics Finland.
Thefamilysociodemographiccharacteristicsofparticipants’

before the war was based on the number of children in the fam-
ily as of 1940. Psychopathologic findings in the first generation
were derived from the HDR during 1971 to 2011 using the same
ICDcodesasfortheoffspringgeneration.Toaddresschronicity
of psychopathologic findings in the first generation, we con-
structed a measure that differentiated between parents hospi-
talized once and parents hospitalized 2 or more times.
Statistical Analysis
We fitted Cox proportional hazards regression models with de-
layed entry with estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for psychiatric
hospitalization during the follow-up period and correspond-
ing 95% CIs. The risk set included person-time beginning on
January 1, 1971, until the date of the first hospital admission
for psychiatric disorders for cases or until being censored for
noncases (which occurred at death or the end of the fol-
low-up period [December 31, 2012], when the oldest partici-
pants were aged 52 years).
The primary exposure in the analyses was parental par-
ticipation in the evacuation policy during World War II (coded
1 for parents who were evacuated and placed in foster care and
0 for parents not evacuated). On the basis of previous results28
of higher risk of psychiatric disorders among female evacu-
ees but not males, we differentiated risks of psychiatric hos-
pitalization between offspring of fathers and mothers who had
been evacuated during the war.
We analyzed associations between parental exposure to
evacuationduringWorldWarIIandoffspringpsychiatrichospi-
talizations using conventional cohort analyses and using mod-
els that hold the baseline hazard constant among cousins while
allowing it to differ between those who were not cousins. The
within-cousinanalysesadjustforall(measuredandunmeasured)
factors shared by cousins and thus circumvent potential con-
founding that arises from selection into the evacuation policy
based on family background. Throughout the analyses, we ad-
justed variance estimates to account for nonindependence be-
tween family members. The within-cousin fixed-effects analy-
sis is an extension of sibling comparisons in adult outcomes
reportedinapreviousstudy28analyzingonlythesampleofwar-
time cohorts (n = 46 877). The fixed-effects design applied ad-
justs for the component of family background shared by cous-
insandlikelyaccountsforfewerpotentialconfoundersthanthe
siblingdesigndoes.Nevertheless,basedontheliteratureonin-
tergenerationaltransmissionofsocioeconomicstatus,weknow
that,forexample,familyincomeiscorrelatedamonggenetically
close relatives. Although the degree of similarities in the family
environmentisgreaterforsiblingsthanfirstcousins,thereisevi-
dence of substantial correlations in labor market outcomes and
educational outcomes for first cousins.31,32
One potential explanation for an association between
evacuation during World War II and offspring psychiatric dis-
order is that former evacuees themselves were more likely to
develop psychiatric disorders (as demonstrated previously),
which is an established risk factor for offspring psychiatric
disorder.33Accordingly,weextendedtheCoxproportionalhaz-
ards regression models to control for parental psychiatric
hospitalization.Weanalyzedparentalhospitalizationasatime-
varying covariate coded as the cumulative number of hospi-
talizations (0, 1, or ≥2) recorded in the HDR as of each person-
year in the risk set. All analyses were performed using Stata
software, version 14 (StataCorp).
Results
Of the 93 391 study persons, 45 955 (49.2%) were women and
47 436 (50.8) were men; mean (SD) age in 2012 among survi-
vors was 45.4 (6.58) years. Table 1 presents the characteris-
ticsofparticipantsbyevacuationstatusandsex.Atotalof2992
participants’parents (3.3%) were evacuated to Sweden dur-
ing World War II. A total of 7495 participants (3614 male) were
hospitalized for psychiatric disorders during the follow-up pe-
riod. A total of 55 516 (59.4%) of the sample was born be-
tween 1961 and 1970 (see eFigure 2 in the Supplement for the
age distribution of the sample at the time of censoring).
Table 2 documents baseline covariates of the exposed par-
ticipants and the unexposed participants. Of note, the par-
ents of the exposed came from larger families and more fre-
quently spoke Swedish as their native language.

 hood was associated with a higher risk of psychiatric hospi-
talization (HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.04-4.01). This association ap-
pears to be driven by an elevated risk of being admitted to the
hospital for mood disorders for women whose mothers were
evacuated during childhood compared with their cousins
whose mothers remained with their families throughout the
war (HR, 4.68; 95% CI, 1.92-11.42). This result, combined with
our previously reported elevated risk of admission to the hos-
pital for the mothers who were evacuated as children, sug-
gests intergenerational persistence for women in the psychi-
atric consequences of participation in the Finnish evacuation
induced by the adverse events during World War II.28

 eration with the risk of psychiatric hospitalization among ex-
posedandunexposedoffspringinthesecondgeneration.Apre-
vious study28 found that the families who adhered to the
Finnish evacuation policy were a sociodemographically se-
lectedgroupoffamilies.Wethereforeadjustedforfamilyback-
ground by controlling for cousin fixed effects in our model.
The results suggest that there are differences in risk of psy-
chiatrichospitalizationsamongoffspringofthegenerationwho
were children during World War II. We observed a signifi-
cantly elevated risk of psychiatric hospitalizations for mood
disorders for female offspring whose mothers had been evacu-
ated to foster care during childhood compared with their fe-
male cousins whose mothers had remained with their biologi-
cal parents throughout the war. Because mood disorders
account for up to 45% of all psychiatric hospitalizations, psy-
chiatric hospitalization for any disorder (all diagnoses in-
cluded) was also increased among female offspring of evacu-
ated mothers. The elevated risk of offspring disorders among
females did not appear to be accounted for by maternal psy-
chopathologic findings. For male offspring, no significant in-
tergenerational associations were found.
The finding of a multigenerational persistence of associa-
tionsbetweenunaccompaniedevacuationandpsychiatrichos-
pitalizations for mood disorders among female offspring of ex-
posed mothers is important for multiple reasons. First, this
result contributes to evidence that suggests persistence in psy-
chiatric harms of childhood trauma that reaches across
generations.19 Second, results point to sex-specific patterns in
this intergenerational persistence; we did not find an in-
creased risk of psychiatric hospitalizations for mood disor-
ders among male offspring of exposed mothers.
Strengths and Limitations
This study used high-quality, population-based data on a 10%
sample of followed-up individuals born from January 1, 1933,
through December 31, 1944, drawn from the 1950 Finnish Cen-
susofPopulationandtheiroffspringbornfromJanuary1,1950,

parental sex were derived from one model by including parental sex and an
interaction between parental sex and evacuee status. Other predetermined
variables included in the cohort analyses were the background variables
summarized in Table 2 and parental county of birth (all predetermined
variables cancel out in the within-cousin analyses). Dummies for parental birth
cohort (1933-1944) and parental birth order were included in all models.
Within-cousin models stratify the Cox proportional hazards regression with
respect to parental family (ie, holding the baseline hazard constant for children
to siblings in the parental birth cohorts). All SEs are cluster adjusted to account
for serial correlation within families.

 linking offspring to the child evacuee generation. One of the
unique features of these data are that many families evacuated
only some of their children to Sweden for reasons mainly per-
tainingtothewaytheguidelinesofthepolicywereformulated,28
giving rise to sibling pairs discordant for exposure. In the inter-
generational analysis of the psychiatric harms of exposure per-
sistingintheoffspring,thediscordanceprovidedawithin-cousin
comparison for the offspring generation. Within the context of
unaccompaniedevacuation,itisunusualtohaveaccesstoinfor-
mationonbackgroundcharacteristics,exposure,andoutcomes
for comparisons pertaining to the base population and particu-
larly for unexposed siblings.
This study has, however, certain limitations. First, the
within-cousin design does not adjust for nonshared childhood
experiences,andcousinswouldtypicallyhavefewerbackground
characteristics in common than siblings. Thus, residual con-
founding bias cannot be ruled out, particularly by factors that
might have differentially selected children in a family for the
evacuation program. Second, approximately 10% of the popu-
lationoftherelevantwarcohortsinthe1950censuswasnotin-
cluded in the study sample at the start of follow-up in 1971 be-
causeofdeath-andmigration-relatedattrition.Thus,theresults
and conclusions about intergenerational persistence of child-
hoodexposuretounaccompaniedevacuationarevalidonlyfor
the population that was alive and residing in Finland at the be-
ginningofthefollow-upperiodinJanuary1,1971.However,the
attrited sample differs from the study sample only marginally
with respect to evacuation status, sex, and native language.34
Third, part of the association may be attributable to assortative
mating,althoughanearlierstudy35onmaritaltraitsoftheevacu-
eesdidnotfindanassociationbetweenevacuationandthelike-
lihood of getting married. Fourth, the analyses that control for
parental psychiatric hospitalization do not fully account for all
parentalpsychopathologicconditionsgiventhatonlyseveredis-
orders receive hospital care. Thus, this study does not fully ad-
dress the possibility that parental psychopathologic conditions
explain the observed association between the evacuation and
offspringpsychopathologicfindings.Furthermore,comparisons
ofHRsacrossCoxproportionalhazardsregressionmodelswith
andwithoutparentalpsychopathologicconditionscannotbein-
terpreted causally.36
Conclusions
The findings of this multigenerational cohort study extend-
ing a prior study28 that assessed the psychiatric outcomes of
the child evacuees contribute to the increasing evidence in
global health that child refugees may experience health con-
sequences that persist long after reunification. This study is,
to our knowledge, the first multigenerational study on the in-
tergenerational persistence of wartime trauma that had a non-
exposed comparison group and used a fixed-effect design to
adjustforpotentialconfoundingfactorswithinthesharedfam-
ily background.
Whether these findings generalize to contemporary refu-
gee contexts, many of which do not involve the type of govern-
ment oversight and monitoring that was in place during the
Finnish evacuation policy, is unknown. In addition, the mean
duration that children were with Swedish families was 2 years,
lasting up to 5 years. In contrast, in some contemporary
contexts,durationofrefugeestatusislonger(insomeinstances
persisting across generations). One might therefore expect the
intergenerationalconsequencesofwar-relatedexperiencesdur-
ing childhood to be even stronger today, although this expec-
tationshouldbeinvestigatedincontemporarysettings,particu-
larly in light of the global crisis of childhood displacement.37
There are 2 additional questions that warrant further study
based on our findings. First, to what extent do the intergenera-
tional consequences of war-related exposures depend on the
age and duration of exposure? Second, to identify potential in-
tervention targets to reduce intergenerational consequences,
what mechanisms account for the observed intergenerational
effects? Parental psychopathologic conditions did not explain
the findings in our study, but this result only pertained to dis-
orders in hospitalized parents; thus, future work is needed in
thisrespect.Wealsospeculatedthatmechanismscouldinclude
influences on family processes, including parenting and physi-
ologic (including epigenetic) pathways, many of which have
been observed among children exposed to other forms of
disadvantage5,38,39 and many of which can be directly targeted

of displaced individuals.40

a Men born between 1951 and 2012. Data for evacuated fathers are for 23 571
observations, of which 811 were exposed, and for evacuated mothers are
23 865 observations, of which 693 were exposed. Associations by parental
sex were derived from one model by including parental sex and an interaction
between parental sex and evacuee status. Other predetermined variables
included in the cohort analyses were the background variables summarized in
Table 2 and parental county of birth (all predetermined variables cancel out in
the within-cousin analyses). Dummies for parental birth cohort (1933-1944)
and parental birth order were included in all models. Within-cousin models
stratify the Cox proportional hazards regression with respect to parental
family (ie, holding the baseline hazard constant for children to siblings within
the parental birth cohorts). All SEs are cluster adjusted to account for serial
correlation within families.
