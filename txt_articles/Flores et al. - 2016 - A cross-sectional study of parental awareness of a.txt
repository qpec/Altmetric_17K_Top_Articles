Abstract
Background: Minority children have the highest US uninsurance rates; Latino and African-American children
account for 53 % of uninsured American children, despite comprising only 48 % of the total US child population.
The study aim was to examine parental awareness of and the reasons for lacking health insurance in Medicaid/
CHIP-eligible minority children, and the impact of the children’s uninsurance on health, access to care, unmet
needs, and family financial burden.
Methods: For this cross-sectional study, a consecutive series of uninsured, Medicaid/CHIP-eligible Latino and
African-American children was recruited at 97 urban Texas community sites, including supermarkets, health
fairs, and schools. Measures/outcomes were assessed using validated instruments, and included sociodemographic
characteristics, uninsurance duration, reasons for the child being uninsured, health status, special healthcare needs,
access to medical and dental care, unmet needs, use of health services, quality of care, satisfaction with care, out-of-
pocket costs of care, and financial burden.
Results: The mean time uninsured for the 267 participants was 14 months; 5 % had never been insured. The most
common reason for insurance loss was expired and never reapplied (30 %), and for never being insured, high
insurance costs. Only 49 % of parents were aware that their uninsured child was Medicaid/CHIP eligible. Thirty-eight
percent of children had suboptimal health, and 2/3 had special healthcare needs, but 64 % have no primary-care
provider; 83 % of parents worry about their child’s health more than others. Unmet healthcare needs include:
healthcare, 73 %; mental healthcare, 70 %; mobility aids/devices, 67 %; dental, 61 %; specialty care, 57 %; and vision,
46 %. Due to the child’s health, 35 % of parents had financial problems, 23 % cut work hours, and 10 % ceased work.
Higher proportions of Latinos lack primary-care providers, and higher proportions of African-Americans experience
family financial burden.
Conclusions: Half of parents of uninsured minority children are unaware that their children are Medicaid/CHIP-eligible.
These uninsured children have suboptimal health, impaired access to care, and major unmet needs. The child’s health
causes considerable family financial burden, and one in 10 parents ceased work. The study findings indicate urgent
needs for better parental education about Medicaid/CHIP, and for improved Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment.

 Background
Although the number and proportion of US children
without health insurance modestly declined between
2008-2012 [1], 6 % of US children (4.8 million) are unin-
sured [2], and 68 % (3.3 million) are eligible for but not
enrolled in Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance
Program (CHIP) [3]. Among uninsured US children, ra-
cial/ethnic disparities exist. In contrast to only 4.9 % of
white children being uninsured, 9.6 % of Latino and
5.1 % of African-American children are uninsured [2].
Indeed, Latino and African-American children account
for 53 % of uninsured American children [4], despite
comprising only 48 % of the total population of US
children [5].
Although 2.4 million Latino and African-American
children are uninsured [4], not enough is known about
the health and healthcare impact on these children of
uninsurance, particularly from studies analyzing primary
(rather than administrative/secondary) data. For the 1.6
million uninsured Latino and African-American children
eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP, it is un-
known what proportion of parents are aware of their
children’s Medicaid/CHIP eligibility, and the reasons
why these children remain uninsured. The study aims,
therefore, were to identify the health and healthcare im-
pact, parental awareness of uninsured children’s Medic-
aid/CHIP eligibility, and reasons why children lost or
never had health insurance, among uninsured minority
children eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP.
Specifically, the objective was to use uniquely extensive
primary data on a sample of uninsured minority children
eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP to assess:
parental sociodemographic features and health-insurance
characteristics, and children’s sociodemographic features,
health insurance, reasons for loss of health insurance and
never having health insurance, health status, special
healthcare needs (SHCNs), access to healthcare, unmet
healthcare needs, use of health services, out-of-pocket
healthcare costs, quality of care, quality of life, parental
satisfaction with care, financial burden of children’s
healthcare, and missed school and work due to the child’s
health.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this cross-sectional study, a consecutive series of un-
insured Latino and African-American children 0-18
years old residing in Dallas County who were eligible for
but not enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP was recruited from
June 2011 to January 2014 at 97 community sites in re-
gions with the highest proportion of uninsured and low-
income residents. To avoid distortion due to clustering,
only one uninsured child per family was enrolled. To en-
sure participants were representative of families with
uninsured children in these regions, recruitment oc-
curred in a variety of community settings, including su-
permarkets, department stores, dollar stores, Goodwill
stores, restaurants, public libraries, community centers,
food banks, health fairs, Boys and Girls clubs, YMCAs,
churches, schools, community outpatient clinics, day-
care
establishments,
Laundromats,
apartment
com-
plexes, housing projects, homeless shelters, and WIC
centers. Participant eligibility criteria included: 1) chil-
dren 0-18 years old currently lacking health insurance;
2) parental self-identification of the child as Latino/His-
panic, African-American/black, or both; and 3) the child
is eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. Eligibility for Medicaid
or CHIP initially was determined in the field by research
staff using family income, assets, and other information
required to determine eligibility by the State of Texas,
and then officially confirmed through electronic verifica-
tion by the Texas Health and Human Services Commis-
sion, which administers both Medicaid and CHIP for the
state. Subjects subsequently participated in a random-
ized trial, called Kids’ HELP (Kids' Health Insurance by
Educating Lots of Parents), of the effects of parent men-
tors on insuring uninsured minority children, full details
of which are available elsewhere [6].
Dallas County, TX, is an ideal setting for studying un-
insured minority children, because: 1) Texas has the
highest proportion and number of uninsured of any state
in America, at 19 % and five million, respectively; 2)
Texas has the highest number of uninsured children
(783,938); and 3) 15.9 % of children in Dallas County are
uninsured, compared with 9 % in Texas and 6 % in the
US [7–9].
All
participants
provided
written
consent
and/or
assent (when indicated). This study was approved by the
University of Texas Southwestern Institutional Review
Board.
Surveys
Primary caregivers (as identified by families) completed
eligibility screening surveys (using Texas Medicaid/CHIP
eligibility criteria [10]) and two questionnaires (in Eng-
lish or Spanish, according to parental preference) orally
administered by trained bilingual research assistants, to
overcome language and literacy barriers. The conceptual
framework for the questionnaire domains and questions
was a slightly modified version of the World Health
Organization’s social-determinants-of-health framework
[11]: specifically, survey items focused on social determi-
nants of health, defined as the conditions in which
people are born, grow, live, work, and age, and which
are considered primarily responsible for health inequi-
ties. The first questionnaire consisted of 82 questions
addressing parental and children’s characteristics; when-
ever possible, validated questions from longstanding
Flores et al. International Journal for Equity in Health  (2016) 15:44 
Page 2 of 13
 national and state surveys and published articles were
used [12–25]. Fourteen questions addressed parental
sociodemographics and health insurance, and 68 exam-
ined children’s sociodemographics, health insurance, rea-
sons for loss of health insurance and never having health
insurance, health status, SHCNs, access to healthcare,
unmet healthcare needs, use of health services, out-of-
pocket healthcare costs, quality of care, parental satisfac-
tion with care, financial burden of children’s healthcare,
and missed school and work due to the child’s health.
The Maternal and Child Health Bureau’s standard defin-
ition for SHCNs was used (those who have a chronic
physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condi-
tion and who also require health and related services of
a type or amount beyond that required by children gen-
erally) [26]. Children’s quality of life was assessed using
the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 Gen-
eric Core Scales (PedsQL) [27]. Responses to open-
ended questions were categorized by theme, and fre-
quencies of response themes tallied. Complete details on
definitions, outcomes, and survey instruments are avail-
able elsewhere [6].
Parental awareness of the uninsured child’s Medicaid/
CHIP eligibility was assessed with the yes/no question,
“Your child is eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. Did you
know that?” For affirmative responses, parents also were
asked the open-ended question, “Why have you chosen
not to enroll your child in Medicaid or CHIP?” Although
implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) oc-
curred in only the final month of the 32 months of data
collection, parents were asked whether the ACA affected
their awareness and knowledge of children’s Medicaid/
CHIP, and none reported any ACA impact.
Analyses
SAS 9.3 was used for all analyses, with a two-tailed P < .05
considered statistically significant. To summarize parental
and child characteristics, percentages were used for cat-
egorical data and means for continuous data. Bivariate
analyses identified racial/ethnic differences and factors as-
sociated with parental awareness of Medicaid/CHIP eligi-
bility. The non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used to
evaluate continuous variables, and the Pearson Chi-square
test for categorical outcomes. For the hierarchical multi-
variable logistic regression analysis of factors associated
with parental unawareness of children’s Medicaid/CHIP
eligibility, SAS Proc Logistic was used, with stepwise selec-
tion and an initial alpha-to-enter of 0.15 [28].
Results
Sample characteristics
We screened 49,361 caregivers; 49,094 candidates were
excluded, due to failure to meet inclusion criteria, children
already having Medicaid/CHIP or private insurance, and
other reasons, yielding the final sample of 267 children
(Fig. 1). The mean child age was seven years old, half were
female,
about
2/3
were
Latino,
1/3
were
African-
American, and most were US-born (Table 1). Primary
caregivers (hereafter referred to as parents) were predom-
inantly female; 1/3 had limited English proficiency
(LEP), the plurality were married and living with the
spouse, >40 % were not high-school graduates, and > ½
were unemployed. About ¼ of parents had health insur-
ance, primarily Medicaid. The mean annual family in-
come was $21,857. There were means of two children
and two adults in the households.
Less than ½ of parents were aware their uninsured
child was Medicaid/CHIP eligible (Table 1). Ninety-five
percent of children ever had insurance before, most
commonly Medicaid (almost ¾ of children), followed by
CHIP, private insurance, and Mexico’s public health in-
surance. The mean months without health insurance
was 14, ranging from 1 month to 12 years, with a me-
dian of six months uninsured.
Reasons for insurance loss/never having insurance
Insurance coverage most commonly was lost due to insur-
ance expiration without parents ever reapplying, in 1/3 of
cases (Table 1). The next most common reasons were the
family had too much income/did not qualify, changing jobs,
change of address, and applied but never received a subse-
quent reply. The remaining 12 reasons were cited by <9 %
of parents.
For the 5 % of children never insured during their life-
time, the most common reasons for the child never be-
ing covered included the high cost of insurance (1/4),
and language barriers, moving to Texas, and hassles,
each at 15 %. Other reasons included originally not a
documented citizen, being told the child is ineligible due
to parental employment, applied but never heard back,
and no reason, each at 8 %. Thus, in contrast to children
with previous insurance coverage, unique reasons for
those never covered include a move to Texas, hassles,
and being told parental employment makes children
ineligible.
Factors associated with parental unawareness
Several factors were associated with parental unaware-
ness of uninsured children’s Medicaid/CHIP eligibility
(Table 2). The mean duration of uninsurance was longer
for unaware vs. aware parents (17 vs. 12 months), and
the mean family income was higher by almost $4,000.
Latino parents (57 %) were more likely to be unaware
than African-American parents (40 %). Racial/ethnic dif-
ferences in awareness, however, disappeared after adjust-
ment for uninsurance duration and income (Table 3).

 Health status and SHCNs
Over one-third of children had not excellent/very good
health status (Table 4). More than four in five parents
reported worrying about their child’s health more than
other people, and ¾ expressed worry/concern about the
child’s health. About 2/3 of children have SHCNs, con-
sisting of 17 conditions, including particularly high rates
(≥12 %) of eczema, respiratory allergies, asthma, behav-
ior problems, and bone/joint conditions. In addition to
these five conditions, noteworthy among the remaining
12 conditions include a 5-7 % prevalence of attention-
deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), speech problems,
depression, and anxiety; a 1-2 % prevalence of hearing
problems, autism, and brain injury; and > ¼ with other
health problems.
Access and unmet needs
Substantial access barriers to healthcare and unmet
needs were identified (Table 4). Approximately 2/3 of
children have no primary-care provider (PCP), 40 % have
no usual preventive-care source, >½ have different
sources of preventive and sick care, and one in 10 never/
sometimes gets immediate care from the PCP. About
nine in 10 have a usual source of care that has no night
or weekend hours and have no access to 24-h phone
coverage for sick care, 2/3 have no access to same-day
sick-care visits without appointments, one in five has no
usual sick-care source, one in eight has difficulty obtain-
ing sick-care appointments, and 11 % of LEP parents
never/sometimes have access to medical interpreters.
One in 12 children needing specialty care experienced
problems obtaining specialty care, 8 % of those needing
special services encountered problems obtaining those
services, and 6 % of parents are never/sometimes able to
obtain after-hours telephone help/advice.
Almost ¾ of parents delayed/didn’t get needed health-
care for their children (Table 4). Almost two-thirds of
children had unmet dental-care needs, and > ½ had un-
met preventive-care needs. All children with auditory
deficits had unmet needs for hearing aids/hearing care.
Among children with specific needs, >2/3 had unmet
needs for physical/occupational/speech therapy; mental
healthcare; and mobility aids/devices. Almost 60 % of
children had unmet specialty-care needs, and > ½ had
problems obtaining specialty referrals. Approximately
half of children had unmet needs for home healthcare

 and vision care. About ¼ of children needing medical
supplies/equipment did not receive them, and one in five
children had unmet needs for acute care and prescrip-
tion medications.
Use of services, financial burden, and missed school and
work
Children averaged three physician visits, one preventive
visit, two sick visits, one ED visit, and 0.1 hospital stays
annually (Table 4). Mean out-of-pocket costs ranged
from $47/preventive visit to $593/hospitalization.
Almost ½ of parents reported needing additional in-
come to cover children’s medical expenses, and >1/3 that
the
child’s
health
caused
family
financial
problems
(Table 4). Approximately ¼ of parents reported the family
cut work hours to obtain healthcare for children, and one
in 10 stopped working because of their child’s health.
Children missed a mean of three school days, and
parents a mean of two work days annually due to
children’s illnesses (Table 4). The mean wage loss was
$343/missed work day, and families also incurred mean
additional costs of $156 in the past year due to chil-
dren’s illnesses.
Quality of care, satisfaction with care, and quality of life
Mean quality-of-care ratings ranged from 8-9 (Table 4).
Forty percent of parents reported children’s doctor
never/sometimes asks how they are feeling as parents,
and > ¼ that doctors never/sometimes understand how
they prefer to raise their child (Table 4). Between 14-
21 % of parents reported the doctor never/sometimes
understands children’s specific needs or respects the par-
ent as the expert on the child, the doctor didn’t spend
enough time with the child, and the parent did not ask
doctors all questions he/she wanted. Almost ¼ of par-
ents would not recommend their child’s healthcare pro-
vider to friends. The overall mean PedsQL score was 91
(Table 4).
Racial/ethnic differences
A higher proportion of Latinos report worrying about
their child’s health more than others, at almost 90 % vs.
3/4 of African-Americans (Table 5). Almost ¾ of Latino
children have no PCP, vs. about ½ of African-American
children, and Latino children are more likely to have no
usual preventive-care source, and different sources of
preventive and acute care. Almost all Latino children
have usual sources of care without night or weekend
hours and lacking 24-h phone coverage for sick care, vs.
approximately ¾ of African-American children for both.
Mean out-of-pocket costs per doctor visit and per sick
visit and the number of yearly sick visits also were
greater for Latino children.

Discussion
Over half of parents are unaware that their uninsured
minority children are Medicaid/CHIP eligible. These
new quantitative results complement prior qualitative
work documenting that lack of Medicaid/CHIP aware-
ness is a major reason why parents have not insured un-
insured minority children [29, 30]. These qualitative
studies shed light on the reasons for parental unaware-
ness of uninsured children’s Medicaid/CHIP eligibility,
including parents lacking basic knowledge about Medic-
aid/CHIP, their eligibility rules, and the application
process; language and immigration issues; income verifi-
cation obstacles; misinformation from insurance repre-
sentatives; system impediments; and family mobility.
The current study findings indicate lack of Medicaid/
CHIP awareness remains a substantial barrier for the 3.3
million uninsured US children eligible for but not en-
rolled in Medicaid/CHIP, and suggest that enhancing
awareness and outreach will be crucial to insuring more
uninsured children. The data indicate that special efforts
should be made to target populations at highest risk of
parental unawareness of children’s Medicaid/CHIP eligi-
bility, including those uninsured the longest, those at the
higher end of income eligibility, and Latinos.
The results reveal that broad system issues also im-
pede parents from insuring Medicaid/CHIP-eligible chil-
dren. One in seven children lost insurance because
Medicaid/CHIP representatives incorrectly told parents
that their children did not qualify for these programs or
parental income was excessive, although all children
were Medicaid/CHIP eligible. Insurance representatives
also incorrectly told some families that children had
“aged out” of coverage. Remedying these serious system
barriers to insuring uninsured children may require bet-
ter training of insurance representatives and careful
monitoring and reporting of such system glitches. In
addition, 9 % of parents reported they had applied for
Medicaid/CHIP for their children, but never received a
reply, suggesting substantial room for system improve-
ment in application tracking and responses.
Ninety-five percent of uninsured children previously
had insurance, underscoring Medicaid/CHIP retention
will continue to be especially important in eliminating
childhood uninsurance. About ¾ of children previously
had Medicaid coverage, indicating Medicaid loss is a
considerable challenge, and perhaps reflecting Texas (at
the time of this study) was one of two states still requir-
ing Medicaid renewal every six months, and one of 27
states not providing 12-month continuous Medicaid eli-
gibility (i.e., regardless of family-income fluctuations)
[31]. Parents reported a panoply of reasons for children
losing coverage, most commonly not reapplying after in-
surance expiration and not knowing why coverage was
lost, suggesting better parental education is needed. It is
concerning that system problems accounted for ¼ of
children losing coverage. Although all children were Me-
dicaid/CHIP eligible, 13 % incorrectly were told they
were ineligible, and 9 % applied with no response from
the Medicaid/CHIP program. Parents changing jobs and
family moves comprised ¼ of the reasons why children
lost insurance; such challenging impediments may re-
quire tailored interventions known to be effective in in-
suring uninsured minority children, such as community
health workers [32] and parent mentors [33].
Both the duration without coverage and proportion of
children never insured are troubling. Multiple studies
document uninsured children are significantly more
likely than insured children to have suboptimal health,
no regular physician, delayed immunizations, unmet
needs, impaired specialty access [34] and higher odds of
ED visits [35], avoidable hospitalizations [36], injury hos-
pitalizations [37], adverse newborn outcomes [38], and
death in hospitals, ICUs, and after trauma [39, 40]. Our
study population averaged 14 months without insurance,
with some uninsured up to 12 years, placing many at
high risk for these deleterious consequences, with the

 one in 20 children never insured during their lifetime at
especially high risk. Parental reasons for children never
having insurance seem amenable to interventions, in-
cluding language barriers, hassles, better understanding
of eligibility criteria, more responsive Medicaid/CHIP
systems, and reducing premiums and copays.
The study findings indicate that uninsurance takes a
major toll on children’s health, and that many have
SHCNs. Approximately 40 % of children have subopti-
mal health, 2/3 have SHCNs, and four in five parents
worry about their child’s health more than others. These
findings suggest that insuring these uninsured children
has the potential to improve children’s health while re-
ducing parental worry.
Substantial access barriers and unmet needs were
noted. Although RCTs are needed, evidence from obser-
vational studies indicates insuring uninsured children
improves access, reduces unmet needs, and increases
preventive and acute visits [14–16, 18, 41–43]. This is
the first study, however, to our knowledge, to use pri-
mary data from in-depth surveys to identify considerable
unmet needs for uninsured children with SHCNs, in-
cluding unmet needs for 100 % of children requiring
hearing aids/hearing care, and most children needing
physical/occupational/speech therapy, mental healthcare,
mobility aids, and home healthcare.
Identified racial/ethnic differences have implications
for providing care for uninsured children. The findings
suggest that for clinicians and health systems caring for
uninsured Latino children, it may prove particularly use-
ful to reduce parental worry about children’s health and
out-of-pocket costs, and ensure that children have PCPs,
regular sources of preventive care, and 24-h phone sick-
care coverage. For clinicians and health systems caring
for uninsured African-American children, it may prove
particularly useful to focus on higher rates of asthma
and ADHD, access to same-day sick visits without ap-
pointments, unmet acute-care and prescription needs,
phone help/advice, reducing ED visits, improving pro-
viders’ understanding of parental preferences for raising
children, and additional income needs for children’s
medical expenses.
Certain study limitations should be noted. The research
was conducted in urban settings in Texas, so the results
may not necessarily generalize to non-urban settings or
other states. Only Latinos and African-American children
participated, so the findings may not generalize to unin-
sured children in other racial/ethnic groups. Outcomes
were not assessed for insured or white children in the
same communities, so comparisons between insured
and uninsured children and whites and minorities
could not be performed. Due to the length of the three
surveys on insurance and healthcare, we were unable
to
ask
questions
regarding
other
public
services
accessed, such as WIC or public housing. The final
sample size of 267 was relatively small, but is the lar-
gest community-based sample (to our knowledge) of
uninsured children to be assessed for such a wide
spectrum of outcomes.
Sizeable family financial burdens and costs of care
were identified. Substantial proportions of parents
reported needing additional income for children’s

 medical expenses, children’s illnesses causing family fi-
nancial problems, and families reducing work hours to
obtain children’s healthcare, and one in 10 parents
ceased work because of the child’s health. This is par-
ticularly concerning, given that all of these children
are in poor or low-income families with very limited
financial means and reserves. This is further com-
pounded
by
major
out-of-pocket
expenses
for
pediatric care, including a mean of $142/doctor visit,
$47/preventive-care
visit,
$195/sick
visit,
$421/ED
visit, and $593/hospitalization. Factoring in additional
economic losses incurred by caring for sick children,
including a mean wage loss of $343/day and child-care
expenses of $156/day, it is clear that uninsured chil-
dren are costly for parents, families, businesses, and
local economies.
Conclusions
Half of parents of uninsured minority children are unaware
that their children are Medicaid/CHIP-eligible. These unin-
sured children have suboptimal health, impaired access to
care, and major unmet needs for healthcare, mental health-
care, mobility aids/devices, dental care, specialty care, and
vision care. The child’s health causes considerable family fi-
nancial burden, and one in 10 parents ceased work because
of their children’s poor health. These study finding indicate
urgent needs for better parental education about Medicaid/
CHIP and for improved Medicaid/CHIP outreach and en-
rollment. The data also indicate that special efforts should
be made to target populations at highest risk of parental
unawareness of children’s Medicaid/CHIP eligibility, includ-
ing those uninsured the longest, those at the higher end of
income eligibility, and Latinos.

 For clinicians and health systems, the study results
revealed
racial/ethnic
group-specific
barriers
which
would seem to be crucial to target in efforts to improve
the health and healthcare of uninsured minority chil-
dren. For uninsured Latino children, these critical iden-
tified barriers include parental worry about children’s
health and out-of-pocket costs, and children lacking
PCPs, regular sources of preventive care, and 24-hour
phone
sick-care
coverage.
For
uninsured
African-
American
children,
key
identified
barriers
include
higher rates of asthma and ADHD, lack of access to
same-day
sick
visits
without
appointments,
unmet
acute-care and prescription needs, inadequate access to
phone help/advice, high ED visit rates, limited health-
care provider understanding of parental preferences for
raising children, and additional income needs for chil-
dren’s medical expenses.
