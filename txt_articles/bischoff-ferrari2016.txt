IMPORTANCE Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with poor physical performance.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of high-dose vitamin D in lowering the risk of
functional decline.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS One-year, double-blind, randomized clinical trial
conducted in Zurich, Switzerland. The screening phase was December 1, 2009, to May 31,
2010, and the last study visit was in May 2011. The dates of our analysis were June 15, 2012, to
October 10, 2015. Participants were 200 community-dwelling men and women 70 years and
older with a prior fall.
INTERVENTIONS Three study groups with monthly treatments, including a low-dose control
group receiving 24 000 IU of vitamin D3 (24 000 IU group), a group receiving 60 000 IU of
vitamin D3 (60 000 IU group), and a group receiving 24 000 IU of vitamin D3 plus 300 μg of
calcifediol (24 000 IU plus calcifediol group).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was improving lower extremity
function (on the Short Physical Performance Battery) and achieving 25-hydroxyvitamin D
levels of at least 30 ng/mL at 6 and 12 months. A secondary end point was monthly reported
falls. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index.
RESULTS The study cohort comprised 200 participants (men and women �70 years with a
prior fall). Their mean age was 78 years, 67.0% (134 of 200) were female, and 58.0% (116 of
200) were vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/mL) at baseline. Intent-to-treat analyses showed that,
while 60 000 IU and 24 000 IU plus calcifediol were more likely than 24 000 IU to result in
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of at least 30 ng/mL (P = .001), they were not more effective in
improving lower extremity function, which did not differ among the treatment groups
(P = .26). However, over the 12-month follow-up, the incidence of falls differed significantly
among the treatment groups, with higher incidences in the 60 000 IU group (66.9%; 95%
CI, 54.4% to 77.5%) and the 24 000 IU plus calcifediol group (66.1%; 95% CI, 53.5%-76.8%)
group compared with the 24 000 IU group (47.9%; 95% CI, 35.8%-60.3%) (P = .048).
Consistent with the incidence of falls, the mean number of falls differed marginally by
treatment group. The 60 000 IU group (mean, 1.47) and the 24 000 IU plus calcifediol group
(mean, 1.24) had higher mean numbers of falls compared with the 24 000 IU group (mean,
0.94) (P = .09).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although higher monthly doses of vitamin D were effective in
reaching a threshold of at least 30 ng/mL of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, they had no benefit on
lower extremity function and were associated with increased risk of falls compared with
24 000 IU.

mpaired lower extremity function is a major risk factor for
falls, hip fractures, frailty, and loss of autonomy.1-3 Given
the imminent demographic change resulting in a signifi-
cant growth of the senior segment of the population, strate-
gies that prevent functional decline and the cascade of unde-
sirable and costly consequences are urgently needed.4
Vitamin D supplementation has been proposed as a pos-
siblepreventivestrategyindelayingfunctionaldeclinethrough
its direct effect on muscle strength.5-7 However, definitive data
are lacking on the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementa-
tion and dose requirements related to the improvement of
lower extremity function.
Mechanistically, several lines of evidence link vitamin D
to muscle strength and lower extremity function.7 First,
proximal muscle weakness is a feature of clinical vitamin D
deficiency.8 Second, the vitamin D receptor is expressed in
human muscle tissue, as documented in 6 studies9-14 but not
in a seventh study.15 Third, the results of studies6,16,17 among
older individuals suggest that vitamin D receptor activation in

support a benefit of vitamin D supplementation in the preven-
tionoffalls25,26andhipfractures27,28amongseniors65yearsand
older at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. However, these ben-
efits have been found to be questionable in meta-analyses29-34
that were not restricted to seniors 65 years and older at risk of
vitamin D deficiency and extending to open-design trials.
In a pilot trial among 20 young postmenopausal women,
daily calcifediol administration (20 μg/d) increased levels of
25-hydroxyvitamin D, hereafter 25(OH)D, from a mean of 13.2
to 69.5 ng/mL at the 4-month follow-up (to convert 25[OH]D
level to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.496).35 Compared
with 800 IU of vitamin D per day, which increased levels above
20 ng/mL in most women,35,36 this dosage was accompanied
by a significant 2.8-fold increased odds of maintained or im-
proved lower extremity function.35
In this trial, we investigated our hypothesis that higher
monthly doses of vitamin D or a combination with calcifediol
(which is approximately a 2-3 times more potent liver metabo-
lite of vitamin D37) would increase levels of 25(OH)D in most
study participants to at least 30 ng/mL and thereby reduce the
risk of functional decline. For our study population, we se-
lectedseniors70yearsandolderwithapriorfall,whoareahigh-

Methods
Participants and Study Design
By newspaper advertisement, we recruited home-dwelling
men and women 70 years and older with a low-trauma fall in
the previous 12 months. We screened 463 individuals and en-
rolled200participants.Studyeligibilitycriteriaincludedmain-
taining mobility with or without a walking aid, having the abil-
ity to use public transportation to attend the clinic visits, and
scoring at least 27 on the Mini-Mental State Examination to en-
sure that participants understood the study procedures and
voluntarily agreed to participate by providing written in-
formed consent. Key exclusion criteria were supplemental vi-
tamin D use exceeding 800 IU/d and unwillingness to discon-
tinueadditionalcalciumandvitaminDsupplementation(other
exclusion criteria are listed in the Figure 1 legend).
The study was approved by the Cantonal Ethical Commis-
sion of Zurich, Switzerland, and all participants provided writ-
ten informed consent. The full study protocol can be found in
Supplement 1. Participant enrollment, all data collection, and
examinations took place at the Centre on Aging and Mobility
at the University of Zurich. All staff members and study par-
ticipants were masked to treatment allocation. The screening
phase was December 1, 2009, to May 31, 2010, and the last
studyvisitwasinMay2011.ThedatesofouranalysiswereJune
15, 2012, to October 10, 2015.
Supplementation
In this 12-month, single-center, double-blind clinical trial, par-
ticipants were randomized to 1 of 3 study groups receiving
monthlysupplementationwithvitaminD3.Thefirstgroupwas
a control group receiving 24 000 IU of vitamin D3 (24 000 IU
group)(one5-mLdrinksolutionof24 000IUofvitaminD3once
per month, equivalent to the current recommendation of
800 IU/d, plus 3 placebo capsules once per month). The second
groupreceived60 000IUofvitaminD3(60 000IUgroup)(one
5-mL drink solution containing 60 000 IU of vitamin D3 once
permonth,equivalentto2000IU/d,plus3placebocapsulesonce

plus300μgofcalcifediol(24 000IUpluscalcifediolgroup)(one
5-mL placebo drink solution once per month, plus 2 vitamin D3
capsules containing 12 000 IU each and 1 capsule containing
300μgofcalcifediol,thelivermetaboliteofvitaminD,onceper
month). Drink solutions of vitamin D3 and calcifediol and pla-
cebocapsules(DSMNutritionalProducts;http://www.dsm.com

the expected contents. The potency and safety of vitamin D3 vs
300 μg of calcifediol were previously evaluated.37
Randomization, Masking, and Treatment Allocation
Randomization was computer based in blocks of 6 and strati-
fied by sex by an independent biostatistician. The randomiza-
tion list was sent directly and exclusively to the cantonal phar-
macy in Zurich, Switzerland, that performed the masking. The
study treatment was then shipped to an independent random-
ization center (hospital pharmacy) in charge of treatment al-
location. The randomization center was located at the same
hospital as the recruitment site but in another area with re-
strictedaccess(ie,withnoaccessbystudyteammembers).Par-
ticipants, their treating physicians, and any individual in-
volvedinthecoordinationandimplementationofthetrialwere
masked to treatment allocation.

Dropouts and Adherence to the Study Medication
Nine participants discontinued treatment (2 in the 24 000 IU
group, 4 in the 60 000 IU group, and 3 in the 24 000 IU plus
calcifediol group), although all participants remained in the
trial and were followed up for all end points (Figure 1). Adher-
ence to the study medication exceeded 98.0% in all treat-
ment groups from months 0 to 6 and exceeded 94.0% in all
treatment groups from months 7 to 12, which was confirmed
by counts of returned drink bottles and blister packs.
Measurements
Participantsattended3fullclinicalvisits(atbaseline,6months,
and 12 months) plus a safety visit at 2 weeks to determine se-
rum calcium and creatinine levels and the ratio of urinary cal-
cium to creatinine. The baseline assessment involved func-
tional tests, including the Short Physical Performance Battery
(SPPB),physicalexamination,medicalhistory,bloodandurine
samples, and appendicular muscle mass using intelligent dual
x-rayabsorptiometry(iDXA;GEHealthcare).38ExceptforiDXA,
all assessments were repeated at 6 and 12 months; the iDXA
was repeated only at 12 months. Between clinical visits, study
nurses called participants monthly to assess falls, adverse
events, and adherence to the study medication.
The SPPB score (our primary outcome) was used to as-
sess lower extremity function by walking speed, successive
chair stands, and a balance test and has been validated
extensively.39 In the original trial protocol, we outlined 2 strat-
egies to measure functional decline. During the implementa-
tion of the trial, we changed our strategy to exclusively use the
SPPB score as the primary measure of functional decline. This
decision was based on the feedback from our masked study
physiotherapist that many participants reported pain when

Other reason
Inclusion criteria were mobility with or without a walking aid, ability to use
public transportation to attend the clinic visits, and a score of at least 27 on the
Mini-Mental State Examination. Exclusion criteria were supplemental vitamin D
use exceeding 800 IU/d and unwillingness to discontinue additional calcium
and vitamin D supplementation during the course of the trial. Other exclusion
criteria were the following: current cancer, malabsorption syndrome, heavy
alcohol consumption, uncontrolled hypocalcemia, severe visual or hearing
impairment, use of medications affecting calcium metabolism, diseases causing
hypercalcemia (eg, sarcoidosis), planned travel to sunny locations for longer
than 2 months per year, maximum calcium supplement dose of 250 mg/d (with
no additional vitamin D), use of medications affecting serum 25-hydroxyvitamin
D level (eg, phenobarbital), body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared) of 40 or higher, diseases predisposing to
falls (eg, Parkinson disease, hemiplegia after stroke, and inflammatory arthritis),
hypercalcemia (serum calcium level >10.4 mg/dL [to convert calcium level to
millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25]), and kidney disease (estimated creatinine
clearance <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or kidney stone within 10 years [to convert
creatinine clearance to mL/s/m2, multiply by 0.0167]).

being tested for knee extensor and flexor strength, raising sig-
nificant concerns about the validity of the measure. Accord-
ingly, our analysis plan proceeded only with the SPPB score as
the measure of functional decline and the primary end point
measure. The alternative score was not analyzed.
We also calculated the proportion of participants who
achieved 25(OH)D levels of at least 30 ng/mL. The study was
designed to enroll 210 participants to have 85% power to de-
tect 30% differences in the SPPB score improvement and in
achieved 25(OH)D levels of at least 30 ng/mL.

Analyses
Fasting blood and urine samples were obtained between 8:00
AM and 9:30 AM at all 4 visits (baseline, 2 weeks, 6 months, and
12months).The25(OH)Dserumlevelsweremeasuredbyasen-

in the National Institute of Standards and Technology/National

For the secondary outcome, we compared the incidence of
fallsbetweenbaselineand6months,6and12months,andbase-
line and 12 months using a logistic regression model with the 0

ered both early and late effects important.
BecausetheprespecifiedprimaryanalysisoftheSPPBscore
over time was limited to the single P value for the interaction,
we did not adjust for the multiple testing. However, caution
is appropriate when interpreting the P values for our second-
ary and exploratory outcomes.
Basedonourinitialanalyses,thedoseofvitaminD(ie,treat-
ment group) was insufficient to explain the outcomes. There-
fore, in an observational analysis, we divided the cohort ac-
cording to quartiles of achieved 25(OH)D levels at 12 months,
anticipating that higher levels would predict better outcomes.
Results
Baseline Characteristics of Participants
At baseline, all 200 participants had reported a fall in the year
before enrollment. Their mean (SD) age was 78 (5) years, and
67.0% (134 of 200) were female. While 42.0% (84 of 200) of
participants were vitamin D replete at baseline (≥20 ng/mL),
58.0% (116 of 200) were vitamin D deficient at baseline (<20
ng/mL), and 13.0% (26 of 200) were severely deficient (<10 ng/
mL). None of the baseline characteristics in Table 1, including
the SPPB score, physical activity,46 and the prevalence of
sarcopenia,38 differed by treatment group.
Changes in 25(OH)D Levels by Treatment Group
Absolute changes in 25(OH)D levels are shown in Figure 2. Af-
teradjustmentforbaseline25(OH)Dlevel,age,sex,andBMI,the
24 000 IU group increased 25(OH)D levels by 12.7 ng/mL (95%
CI,10.6-14.9ng/mL)at6monthsandby11.7ng/mL(95%CI,9.6-
13.8 ng/mL) at 12 months. The 60 000 IU group increased 25
(OH)Dlevelsby18.3ng/mL(95%CI,16.2-20.5ng/mL)at6months
and by 19.2 ng/mL (95% CI, 17.1-21.4 ng/mL) at 12 months. The
24 000 IU plus calcifediol group increased 25(OH)D levels by
27.6 ng/mL (95% CI, 25.4-29.8 ng/mL) at 6 months and by 25.8
ng/mL (95% CI, 23.6-27.9 ng/mL) at 12 months. The changes for
the 60 000 IU group and the 24 000 IU plus calcifediol group
vs the 24 000 IU group were significant at 6 and 12 months
(P < .001). As summarized in Table 2, the percentage of partici-
pants with achieved 25(OH)D levels of at least 30 ng/mL was
significantlyhigherat12monthsinthe60 000IUgroupandthe
24 000 IU plus calcifediol group compared with the 24 000 IU

lessimprovementinthe2high-dosegroupscomparedwiththe
24 000 IU group (P = .04) (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). The find-
ings for other functional and muscle mass end points were
qualitatively similar.
Secondary End Points by Treatment Group
Of the 200 participants, 60.5% (121 of 200) fell during the 12-
month treatment period. Among those, the 60 000 IU group
(66.9%; 95% CI, 54.4%-77.5%) and the 24 000 IU plus calcife-
diolgroup(66.1%;95%CI,53.5%-76.8%)hadsignificantlyhigher
percentages of fallers compared with the 24 000 IU group
(47.9%;95%CI,35.8%-60.3%)at12months(P = .048)(Table2).
Consistent with the percentage of fallers, the mean num-
ber of falls differed marginally by treatment group over the
12-month follow-up (P = .09) (Table 2). The 60 000 IU group
(mean, 1.47; P = .02 vs the 24 000 IU group) and the 24 000 IU
plus calcifediol group (mean, 1.24; P = .22 vs the 24 000 IU
group) had a higher mean number of falls compared with the
24 000 IU group (mean, 0.94). A similar pattern was observed
during months 0 to 6 and months 7 to 12.
Treatment Effect Stratified by Baseline Vitamin D Level
The percentage of participants achieving 25(OH)D levels of at
least 30 ng/mL at 6 and 12 months differed by treatment group
only in those who were vitamin D deficient at baseline.
Seniors who were vitamin D replete at baseline were most vul-
nerable to 60 000 IU of vitamin D3, demonstrating the most
falls (mean, 1.65; P = .02 vs the 24 000 IU group) (Table 3). The
treatment effect did not differ by baseline vitamin D level for
functional decline and the incidence of falls.
Observational Analyses by Quartiles of Achieved 25(OH)D
Levels at 12 Months
SPPB Score
At 12 months, seniors reaching moderate 25(OH)D levels (30.4-
37.4ng/mL)hadthebestSPPBscoreimprovementfrombaseline
(0.45; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.79; P = .01). However, this increase was
notsignificantlydifferentfromthatofthehighestquartile(0.12:
95% CI, −0.24 to 0.48; P = .18) (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Secondary End Points
Seniors reaching the highest quartile of 25(OH)D level (44.7-
98.9 ng/mL) at the 12-month follow-up had a 5.5-fold (odds ra-
tio, 5.52; 95% CI, 2.10-14.50) higher odds of falling compared
with those reaching the lowest quartile of 21.3 to 30.3 ng/mL of
25(OH)D(P < .001)(eTable2inSupplement2).Furthermore,se-
niorsreachingthehighestquartileof25(OH)Dlevelat12months
had the most falls (mean, 1.59) compared with those reaching
the lowest quartile of 25(OH)D level (mean, 0.84) (P = .01).

Regardless of 25(OH)D baseline level and independent of
age, sex, and BMI, participants receiving 60 000 IU of vitamin
D3 had an 18.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-31.4%) probability of reaching
the detrimental highest quartile of 25(OH)D level at 12 months
(range, 44.7-98.9 ng/mL), and participants receiving 24 000 IU
plus calcifediol had a 40.1% (95% CI, 27.7%-53.9%) probabil-
ity. In contrast, no participants in the 24 000 IU group reached
the highest quartile of 25(OH)D level at the 12-month follow-
up. The same pattern was seen at the 6-month follow-up.
Biochemical Safety
The mean serum calcium and creatinine levels and the mean
urinary calcium excretion did not differ by treatment group
at baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up
(eTable 3 and eTable 4 in Supplement 2). A transient increase
in calcium excretion was seen in the 60 000 IU group and the
24 000 IU plus calcifediol group only at the 2-week visit.
Discussion
In this RCT, seniors in the higher-dose vitamin D3 groups
(60 000 IU or 24 000 IU plus calcifediol) experienced no im-
provement in lower extremity function, had the highest per-
centages of fallers, and demonstrated the most falls com-
pared with seniors in the control group (24 000 IU). This
detrimental effect was seen during the first 6 months of the
trialandwasmaintainedduringthelast6monthsandwassup-
ported by our observational analysis. These findings suggest
that participants who reached the highest quartile of 25
(OH)D level (44.7-98.9 ng/mL) at the 12-month follow-up had
the greatest odds of falling and the most falls compared with
those who reached the lowest quartile (21.3-30.3 ng/mL). For
the dosages examined in our study, participants receiving the
2 higher doses were most likely to reach the detrimental high-
est quartile at the 6-month and 12-month follow-ups, inde-
pendent of baseline level. Corroborating the concept of a lack
of benefit with the 2 higher doses of vitamin D, parathyroid
hormone levels were not suppressed by higher doses of vita-
min D compared with 24 000 IU.
High oral doses of vitamin D have been evaluated in 2 ear-
lier trials with prospective fall assessment21,23 and in 1 trial that
assessed falls retrospectively.48 In a trial among 173 frail se-
niors after acute hip fracture, 2000 IU of vitamin D/d vs 800
IU/d did not improve lower extremity function or reduce falls
over a 12-month follow-up (28%; 95% CI, −4% to 68%).23 The
achieved mean 25(OH)D level at 12 months was 44.6 ng/mL in
the2000IU/dgroupcomparedwith35.4ng/mLinthe800IU/d

a All regression models were adjusted for baseline age, sex, and body mass index.
Change over time in our primary study outcome was compared between the 3
study groups using a repeated-measures linear regression model. For the
primary and secondary outcomes, we compared the percentage of fallers in a
logistic regression model, adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. For the number of
falls, we used linear regression, with indicators for treatment group as the main
predictors and covariates to adjust for age, sex, and BMI.

group.23 In another trial of 2256 senior women at high risk of
hip fracture (similar to our trial), an annual bolus of 500 000
IU of vitamin D vs placebo increased the risk of falling (rate ra-
tio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30).21 The bolus group achieved 25
(OH)D levels of 48 ng/mL at the 1-month follow-up and 36
ng/mL at the 3-month follow-up, which is the time frame in
which most falls occurred in the trial.21 In both of these trials,
high-dose vitamin D resulted in mean 25(OH)D levels over-
lapping the highest achieved quartile in our trial.21,23 In a third
trial of 2686 community-dwelling seniors 65 to 85 years old,
a vitamin D3 bolus of 100 000 IU every 4 months for 5 years
significantly reduced the risk of any new fracture by 22% but
did not reduce the risk of falling (relative risk, 0.93; 95% CI,
0.76-1.14).48 However, falls were only assessed retrospec-
tively for the last year of follow-up, and the treatment group
reached a mean 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/mL.48
While our data are consistent with these prior studies, the
physiology behind a possible detrimental effect of a high
monthly bolus dose of vitamin D on muscle function and falls
remains unclear and needs further investigation. The possibil-
itythathigh-dosemonthlyvitaminDmayhaveincreasedphysi-
cal activity and thereby the opportunity to fall was explored in
ouranalysesbutdidnotexplainourfindings.Alternatively,our
results may have been caused by chance. However, this expla-
nation is unlikely given the uniformity of our treatment find-
ings for all muscle-related end points during the first and last 6

a For this table, we divided the study cohort into participants with (n = 116) and
without (n = 84) vitamin D deficiency and repeated the treatment analyses of
Table 2. For most end points, the findings were similar to the overall results in
Table 2. However, there was a suggestion that the mean number of falls
differed most by treatment among those who had higher vitamin D levels at
baseline. We found no statistically significant interaction between treatment
and vitamin D deficiency at baseline for any of the primary and secondary
end points.

months of our trial, as well as given the consistency with our
observational analyses on achieved blood levels.
Two ongoing trials use the same cumulative dose as the
60 000 IU group in our trial. These are the Vitamin D and
Omega-3 Trial (VITAL; http://www.vitalstudy.org) and the
VitaminD3–Omega-3–HomeExercise–HealthyAgeingandLon-
gevity Trial (DO-HEALTH; http://do-health.eu/wordpress).
However, their dosing schedule is daily rather than monthly,
and the patient characteristics differ from those of seniors in
our trial. These trials will provide important opportunities to
verify and expand our findings to other end points.
This trial has several strengths. It was powered adequately
for the end points investigated, and fall rates (ascertained by
diary and monthly telephone calls) were consistent with the
literature.49-52 Wecompared24 000IUofvitaminDpermonth
(equivalent to 800 IU of vitamin D per day, which is often con-
sidered the standard of care53-55 and is considered the current
recommended daily allowance by the Institute of Medicine34)
against2highermonthlydosesofvitaminD.Corroboratingour
treatment findings that high-dose vitamin D increases the risk
of falling, our observational analysis consistently showed
that achieving the highest quartile of 25(OH)D level at the
12-month follow-up may not be advantageous for the preven-
tion of falls. Furthermore, the study population is representa-
tive of a large part of the senior population 70 years and older
stilllivingindependentlyathome,withaMini-MentalStateEx-
aminationscoreofatleast27andsufficientmobilitytousepub-
lictransportationbutatincreasedriskoffunctionaldeclinedue
to a prior fall event. However, because of these selection crite-
ria, our findings may not apply to younger seniors and to indi-
viduals with more limited cognitive or functional abilities and
may have limited our power to detect the primary end point of
functional decline.
A further limitation of our study is the lack of a placebo
group. Therefore, our trial supports low-dose over high-dose
vitamin D supplementation but cannot establish a benefit of
low dose over placebo.
