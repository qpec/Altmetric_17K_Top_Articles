Abstract
Purpose: This phase I study aimed to determine the recom-
mended dose (RD), safety profile, and feasibility of a procedure
combining intratumoral injection of hafnium oxide nanoparti-
cles (NBTXR3; a radioenhancer) and external beam radiotherapy
(EBRT) for preoperative treatment of adults with locally advanced
soft tissue sarcoma (STS).
Experimental Design: Patients had a preoperative indica-
tion of EBRT for STS of the extremity or trunk. Baseline
tumor volume (TV) was calculated by MRI. NBTXR3 was
injected percutaneously into tumors at 53.3 g/L. Dose esca-
lation was based on four levels equivalent to 2.5%, 5%,
10%, and 20% of baseline TV. NBTXR3 was visualized in the
tumor 24 hours postinjection, and EBRT was initiated (50 Gy
over 5 weeks). Surgery was performed 6 to 8 weeks after
EBRT completion.
Results: Twenty-two patients completed NBTXR3 injection,
EBRT, and surgery and were followed for a median 22 months
(range, 6–40). At NBTXR3 20% of TV, two dose-limiting toxicities
occurred: injection-site pain and postoperative scar necrosis. The
RD was defined as 10%. No leakage of NBTXR3 into surrounding
tissues occurred; intratumor NBTXR3 levels were maintained dur-
ing radiotherapy. At the RD, median tumor shrinkage was 40%
(range 71% shrinkage, 22% increase); median percentage of resid-
ual viable tumor cells was 26% (range, 10%–90%). Patients
receiving 20% of TV demonstrated pathologic complete responses.
Seven grade 3 adverse events occurred, which were reversible.
Conclusions: A single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3
at 10% of TV with preoperative EBRT was technically feas-
ible with manageable toxicity; clinical activity was observed.

Introduction
Surgery is the standard treatment for localized extremity soft
tissue sarcomas (STS). The benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy in
extremity STS therapy has been demonstrated in three random-
ized studies (1–3). Preoperative radiotherapy has been associated
with an increase in surgery-related wound complications com-
pared with postoperative radiotherapy (4), whereas long-term
morbidity was improved with pre- versus postoperative radio-
therapy (4, 5). To minimize the toxicity of preoperative radio-
therapy, image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy has
been reported to reduce wound complications (6). However,
tumor shrinkage and pathologic response rates with preoperative
radiotherapy still need to be improved, particularly when a tumor
is deemed to be unresectable or when local control could be
suboptimal. Various radio-potentiation methods have been eval-
uated with encouraging efficacy, but they are hampered by sig-
nificant systemic toxicity (7–9).
Nanomedicine has made tremendous progress and provided
new treatment concepts. Drug delivery systems that change the
biodistribution of drugs have been extensively used (10). Inor-
ganic crystalline nanoparticles with new and specific physical
properties have been developed. These include a new class of
man-made radiation enhancers composed of functionalized
nanoparticles containing high Z material (where Z is atomic
number) with a high electron density (transition metals and their
compounds, e.g., hafnium oxide, gold, and platinum) and a well-
defined size and shape. These NPs are highly efficient at absorbing
radiation because of their physicochemical properties and, there-
fore, can augment the radiation applied to a tumor. They can enter
tumor cells and deposit high levels of energy into the cells, leading
to DNA damage and cell destruction, but only when exposed to

 ionizing radiation (on/off activity; ref. 11). These nanoparticles
may represent a breakthrough approach for the local treatment of
solid tumors. Among them, NBTXR3 NPs contain hafnium oxide,
as the moiety of high electron density, and have been engineered
with an average diameter of 50 nm and a functionalized nega-
tively charged polymer comprising phosphate groups on their
surface. Their chemistry, size, shape, and surface charge have been
designed for optimal cancer cell uptake and the best benefit:risk
ratio. Hafnium oxide is a compound made of hafnium (atomic
number, 72), with a high density of 9, making it an efficient
radioenhancer. This compound is physically and chemically inert
(insulator, nondegradable, no redox activities), thereby providing
beneficial characteristics from a safety perspective. The interaction
of ionizing radiation with hafnium allows for a higher energy
deposit than radiotherapy alone, thereby generating many more
electrons at the same dose of radiation and increasing subsequent
cell death (11–13). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that
NBTXR3 nanoparticles have a strong impact of on cell replication,
tumor control, and survival in animals (12).
This report summarizes findings from the first-in-human study
testing NBTXR3 activated by fractionated external beam radio-
therapy (EBRT) in patients with locally advanced STS. The study
objectives were to assess safety and feasibility of intratumoral
injections of NBTXR3 at increasing volumes to determine the
MDT and recommended dose (RD).
Materials and Methods
Patient population
This was a phase I, open-label, nonrandomized, dose–escala-
tion trial, conducted in two centers in France; patients were
enrolled between November 2011 and April 2014.
Primary eligibility criteria were: patients over 18 years of age
with histologically confirmed STS of the extremity or trunk wall
(primary or recurrent), World Health Organization (WHO) per-
formance scores of 0–1, and adequate bone marrow, kidney, and
liver function. Patients with metastatic disease were included if
their life expectancy was more than 6 months.
Key exclusion criteria were: prior radiotherapy on the anatomic
area to be treated and the following histological subtypes: embry-
onal or alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosar-
coma, Kaposi sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, angio-
sarcoma, aggressive fibromatosis, or dermatofibrosarcoma pro-
tuberans. The tumor types were characterized following the WHO
criteria (14) and graded according to the French Federation of
Cancer Centers system (15). Other investigational drugs were not
allowed. Approval was obtained from the ethics committees of
the participating institutions and the regulatory authorities. All
patients provided informed consent. The study was performed in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, good clinical practice
guidelines, and local regulations. The study was registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number, NCT01433068).
Study characteristics and objectives
Patients were sequentially assigned to escalating volume levels
(doses) of NBTXR3 at a fixed concentration of 53.3 g/L, following a
traditional 3 þ 3 design that was modified for the first two levels, in
which 6 patients were enrolled per level. Primary objectives were to
determine the MTD,RD, and earlydose-limitingtoxicities (DLT), in
addition to safety and feasibility of the intratumoral injection of
NBTXR3 activatedby EBRT.Early DLTs were defined asany grade 3–
4 adverse event (AE) that could reasonably be related to NBTXR3
and/or radiotherapy, including hematologic and biochemistry
toxicity, according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE, version
4.0). All AEs, regardless of the causality and onset time, were
followed until the end of the study. An independent data moni-
toring committee was implemented for this first-in-human study.
NBTXR3 product
NBTXR3 was provided by NANOBIOTIX (Nanobiotix, a nano-
medicine company; www.nanobiotix.com). It is a suspension of
nanoparticles composed of hafnium oxide crystallites and phos-
phate groups in an aqueous medium. The NBTXR3 product was
supplied for local injection in the form of a nonpyrogenic, sterile,
white suspension processed by terminal sterilization (g irradia-
tion), to be administered at a fixed concentration of 53.3 g/L.
Tumor volume measurement
For measurement of tumor volume, the baseline gross tumor
volume (GTV) was defined up to 1 week before study treatment
using MRI and a CT scan and calculated as length � width �
depth. The area surrounding the GTV was included to take into
account adjacent tissue at risk for microscopic extension of disease
(termed the clinical tumor volume, or CTV); this area was further
expanded to account for set-up errors or possible uncertainties
in patient positioning or motion (termed the planning tumor
volume, or PTV).
NBTXR3 dose escalation
Four dose levels of NBTXR3 were used: levels 1 to 4 were
volumes of NBTXR3 equivalent to 2.5%, 5%, 10%, and 20%,
respectively, of the baseline tumor volume. For levels 1 and 2, 6
patients per level were treated. For levels 3 and 4, 3 to 6 patients
Translational Relevance
Evidence before this study
The standard of care for high-risk soft tissue sarcoma is
surgery and external beam radiotherapy; however, improve-
ments are needed. A new class of radiation enhancers, com-
posed of nanoparticles, is highly efficient in absorbing radi-
ation via their physicochemical properties and therefore deli-
vers a higher dose within the tumor. These inorganic nano-
particles may represent a breakthrough approach for the local
treatment of solid tumors. Among them, NBTXR3 first in
clinical trial (hafnium oxide) has been designed for optimal
uptake into cancer cells, with a highly favorable benefit/risk
ratio.
Value added by this study
This first-in-human phase I trial reports the safety of a
procedure combining intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 and
EBRT.
Implications of the evidence
This study constitutes the basis for the current development
of NBTXR3 in a phase III trial in STS and in four phase I trials in
others cancers.

 per level were added sequentially, based on the occurrence of early
DLTs. If 2 of 6 patients experienced early DLTs at a given level, the
dose escalation was stopped. The RD was defined as the level
immediately below that associated with an early DLT. If only 3
patients had been treated at this RD, an additional 6 patients were
included for further safety evaluation.
Injection procedure
A single intratumoral injection of NBTXR3 53.3 g/L was admin-
istered with ultrasound guidance and visualized 24 hours later by
a CT scan (NBTXR3 is easily visualized as a hyperdense particle).
Patients received local anesthesia and anxiolytic treatment with
the injection. Skin access was defined by the surgeon, according to
the planned surgical incision line. Standard syringes and 22 G
needles were selected for insertion every 1.5 to 2.0 cm, using
different angulations, to cover as much of the tumor as possible
(Fig. 1A). After the needles were positioned, NBTXR3 was injected
through each needle, using slow hand pressure to limit pain. The
mandrel was placed in the needle at least 1 minute before
retrieving the needle, to minimize the risk of NBTXR3 dripping
along the needle pathway. Needles were positioned to avoid the
peripheral region of the tumor (1.0 cm) to protect the pseudo-
capsule from trauma.
Local nanoparticle dispersion and evaluation of NBTXR3
potential leakage
In addition to the CT scan performed 24 hours after the
intratumoral injection, a second CT scan was performed 10 weeks
after to evaluate the presence and dispersion of NBTXR3 inside the
tumor, potential leakage into peritumoral tissues, and persistence
of NBTXR3 in the tumor during the entire radiotherapy course. A
chest CT scan was performed to evaluate the potential presence of
NBTXR3 in the lungs. NBTXR3 is an intracellular device, macro-
scopically and microscopically occult. Accordingly, it was not
possible for the pathologist to determine the distribution.
QuantificationofNBTXR3inthe bloodand urine wasperformed
to evaluate passage into the systemic circulation. The hafnium
component of NBTXR3 was quantified through inductively cou-
pled plasma mass spectrometry. Whole blood samples were col-
lected on day 1: before injection, immediately after the injection
start, at the end of the injection, 5, 10, 15, 60, 120, and 240 minutes
after completion of the injection; and on day 2. Three additional
blood samples were collected during radiotherapy, between the
eleventh and twentieth radiotherapy sessions. One blood sample
was also collected prior to surgery. Urine samples were collected
after the NBTXR3 injection (day 1) and before surgery.
EBRT and surgery
Conformal 3D radiotherapy was initiated on day 2 (24 hours
postinjection). A dose of 50 Gy (in 25 daily fractions of 2 Gy over a
5-week period) was delivered to the PTV, following the recom-
mendations of the International Commission on Radiation Units
and Measurements (ICRU reports 50 and 62; refs. 16, 17). The
radiotherapy dose distribution within the PTV was ideally 95% to
107% of the prescribed dose; the ICRU reference point was located
at the center (or in a central part) of the PTV and positioned at the
intersection of the treatment beam axes. Beam energies of 6 to 18
MV were used. Tumor resection was planned 5 to 7 weeks after the
completion of radiotherapy according to surgical rules.
Skin access was defined by the surgeon, according to the
planned surgical incision line, to resect the injection sites and
tracts as well.
Safety
Clinical and laboratory safety parameters, and concomitant
medications, were assessed at baseline, day 1 post-NBTXR3

 injection, day 2 before the onset of radiotherapy, once a week
during radiotherapy, at the preoperative visit, during the 14 days
post-tumorectomy, and at follow-up visits every 8 weeks until the
study cut-off date of February 26, 2015.
A serious AE (SAE) was defined as that resulting in death, was
life threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of exist-
ing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability
or incapacity, or was a congenital abnormality or birth defect.
Efficacy
Dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasonography was performed
to examine treatment-related changes to the tumor. Tumor
response was evaluated based on RECIST criteria v.1.1 (18) and
tumor volume changes, both of which were measured by MRI
during the week preceding surgery. Response evaluation was
performed according to the European Organisation for Research
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma
Group (STBSG) recommendations for pathologic examination
and reporting (19).
Antitumor efficacy was evaluated in terms of pathologic
response (pR), and tumor size and volume, according to RECIST
criteria, where pR was expressed as the percentage of residual
malignant viable cells, and pathologic complete response (pCR)
was defined as less than 5% of residual malignant viable cells.
Complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all
target lesions; any pathologic lymph nodes (whether target or
nontarget) were required to have reductions in their short axis to
less than 10 mm. Partial response (PR) was defined as at least a
30% decrease in the sum of target lesion diameters, using the sum
of the baseline diameters as reference. Progressive disease (PD)
was at least a 20% increase in the sum of target lesion diameters,
taking the smallest sum measured during the study as the refer-
ence (including the baseline sum if it was the smallest); the sum
also had to be an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Stable disease
(SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR,
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking the smallest sum
diameters measured during the study as reference. Margin status
was also assessed.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were descriptive. A preliminary efficacy analysis
was performed in the "All treated population" (i.e., patients who
received a single injection of NBTXR3, even if the full dose was not
administered). Continuous data were summarized for each initial
planned level and cohort, using the number of nonmissing
observations. Qualitative data were summarized using the num-
ber and frequency of nonmissing observations. All analyses were
performed using SAS version 9.2.
Results
Patient characteristics
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Twenty-two
patients were enrolled and treated as follows: 6 patients at level 1
(2.5%) and 6 patients at level 2 (5%). Three patients were initially
assigned to level 3 (10%), with no early DLTs. Two patients were
assigned level 4 (20%); one of these patients experienced two
grade 3 AEs related to NBTXR3 and radiotherapy (injection-site
pain during the injection procedure and postoperative wound
complication), which were considered to be early DLTs. As a
result, no more patients were assigned to level 4. Therefore, 5
additional patients were assigned to level 3 for further safety
exploration.
Treatments
All 22 patients received a single injection of NBTXR3, complet-
ed EBRT, and underwent tumorectomy. The tumor volume
change between baseline and day 1 postinjection of NBTXR3 was
minimal; nanoparticles were retained in the tumor, while the
aqueous solution that the nanoparticles were suspended in
showed rapid clearance. Table 2 shows the NBTXR3 intratumoral
injection characteristics. The duration of the injection procedure

 was dependent upon the number of punctures, with a median
time of 8.5 minutes (range, 2–55 minutes).
Local nanoparticle dispersion and evaluation of NBTXR3
potential leakage
Tumor CT scans showed appropriate diffusion of NBTXR3
throughout the tumor in different sizes and histology types,
without leakage into the surrounding healthy tissues, as well as
persistence of NBTXR3 during the entire duration of radiotherapy
(Fig. 1B and C). Chest CT scans showed no presence of NBTXR3 in
the lungs. The maximum concentration of hafnium (Hfmax) in
whole blood is shown in Fig. 2 (and in Supplementary Table S1).
In most patients, Hfmax was observed at the end of the NBTXR3
injection. No hafnium was found in urine, which confirmed that
NBTXR3 was not excreted renally.
Safety: AEs, early DLTs, and RD
All AEs and laboratory test abnormalities are presented in Table
3. The worst (grade 3) biological or hematologic abnormalities
were reversible in all cases: one case each of elevated alkaline
phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase levels at level 3, one
case of lymphopenia at level 1, and one case of anemia at level 2.
Biochemical and hematologic changes were not considered clin-
ically significant.
The most frequently occurring AEs related to radiotherapy were
erythema and radiation skin injury (grade 1–2), with three occur-
rences each (Table 3). AEs related to both NBTXR3 and radiother-
apy were grade 1 injection-site reaction, grade 1 pyrexia, and grade
3 postoperative wound complication, with one occurrence of each.
All patients received the planned volume of NBTXR3 except two
patients: one patient experienced a vasovagal reaction during the
injection, which led to injection interruption (42.5 mL instead of
52.5 mL). Grade 3 injection-site pain in the second patient led to a
dose reduction of NBTXR3 (84.5 mL instead of 98 mL).
A total of16SAEsin11patientswereobserved:5patientsatlevel
1, 2 patients at level 2, 2 patients at level 3, and 2 patients at level 4.
Eight SAEs were grade 3, four were grade 2, and four were grade 1
(Table 4). During the posttumorectomy follow-up period, no
postoperative wound dehiscence or local infection was observed.
No early DLTs were observed at levels 1 to 3. At level 4, one
patient experienced two AEs that were considered to be early
DLTs: grade 3 injection-site pain relating to high NBTXR3 volume
occurred during NBTXR3 injection, and a grade 3 postoperative
wound complication (postsurgical scar necrosis related to severe
local inflammation), which required remedial surgery with a skin
flap. Level 4 was therefore considered to be nonfeasible due to the
high volume of NBTXR3 injected; enrollment at this level was
stopped, and level 4 was defined as the MTD. Consequently, 5
additional patients were assigned to level 3 (10%), with no
occurrence of early DLTs. Hence, NBTXR3 53.3 g/L, at a volume
equivalent to 10% of the calculated baseline tumor volume, was
defined as the RD for further development.

 Efficacy
Twenty-two patients were evaluated for pR (Fig. 3C), and 21
patients were evaluated for changes in tumor diameter and
volume (Fig. 3A and B); one patient at level 3 was considered
nonevaluable according to RECIST criteria due to aninconsistency
in their MRI evaluation. Five patients achieved a PR: one at level 2,
three at level 3 (the RD), and one at level 4. Of the patients
achieving PR, three had undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma,
one had myxoid liposarcoma, and one had myxoid chondrosar-
coma. Fifteen patients had SD, and one patient had PD. Overall,
5 of the 22 patients had 10% or less residual malignant cells
posttreatment. Both patients at level 4 achieved pCR.
At the RD (level 3), the median percentage of residual malig-
nant viable cells was 26% (range, 10%–90%), and 3 of the 7
evaluable patients (43%) achieved PR with a median maximal
tumor diameter change of �29% (range, �34% to þ32%) and a
median tumor volume change of �40% (�71% to þ22%). The
median minimal margin was 1 mm (range, 0–4 mm). With a
median follow-up of 22 months (range, 6–40), no patient expe-
rienced a local recurrence (LR), and 5 patients exhibited a distant
recurrence, which included nodules in the right and left lungs (in a
patient who was not treated for a primary lesion, but for a local
relapse), bone metastasis in the vertebrae, a paracardiac nodule,
muscular lesions in the left psoas, and a bone nodule.
There was no tumor size effect for the distribution of particles,
as the NBTXR3 quantity to be implanted was a percentage of the
tumor volume at fixed concentration.
Discussion
This phase 1 study is the first human trial to report on a new
concept of radioenhancement with functionalized hafnium oxide
nanoparticles activated by fractionated radiotherapy. It showed
that preoperative NBTXR3 with radiotherapy is a feasible thera-
peutic approach that yields encouraging radiological and patho-
logic responses in patients with locally advanced STS of the
extremity and trunk wall. At a concentration of 53.3 g/L, the RD
for further development of NBTXR3 is equivalent to 10% of the
tumor volume, as measured by MRI at baseline.
The worst (grade 3) abnormalities in biology or hematology
were reversible in all cases. At level 4 (20%), one patient
experienced two grade 3 AEs: injection-site pain and postop-
erative wound complication that required a flap. This AE may
be due to radiotherapy itself or to the association (4). Hence,

 this level was considered to be nonfeasible in this cancer
population.
Concerning the intratumoral injection, its main practical
parameter is the injection technique, which should apparently
fulfil opposing goals: optimal dispersion within the tumor,
no risk for tumor cell seeding through needle pathways,
and minimum discomfort for the patient. Ultrasound images
during injection showed that the NBTXR3 was diffused in the
tumor volume, meaning that the positioning of the needle
inside the tumor is not fundamental. According to the authors
who are radiologists (T. De Baere and X. Buy), the learning
curve of the technique is fast and reproducible. The injection
quality was demonstrated by the optimal intratumoral local-
ization of NBTXR3 and the absence of leakage to healthy
tissues.
Nanoparticles have localized action (less than 10 mm),
which provides a good safety basis, but they are not designed
to be immovable in tumors with changing shapes during
radiotherapy, and they could affect the whole tumor volume.
No patient required radiotherapy replanning due to changes.
The mainly local toxicity profile significantly differentiates this
radioenhancer from radiosensitizers that have their own cyto-
toxicity and lead to various systemic side effects.
The ultimate objective, which is being evaluated in a current
phase II/III trial in STS (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT02379845), is to
increase the efficiency of an already validated treatment with an
additional physical mechanism and to demonstrate large volume
feasibility. With multimodal treatments, LR rates have been
decreasing over time, dropping from more than 20% (20) to
approximately 10% in modern series (21). The current focus is
devoted to further extend this progress to advanced localized
diseases through the reduction of tumor volume. When radio-
therapy is indicated (22, 23), its preoperative use achieves lower
long-term morbidity, but it will not extend the possibilities of
surgery because the median change in maximal tumor diameter
(MTDia) is moderate in the majority of cases (24–26), and the
median change in volume in high-grade tumors is nearly null
(24). In the current study, the median change in MTDia at the RD
was �29%, with a median decrease in volume of �40%. This
favorable tumor shrinkage could promote better margins in
locally advanced sarcomas because they are closely related to
tumor volume, which could translate into more functional
surgery.
In other cancers (27), pCR could be a surrogate marker of
efficacy and possibly of survival (28). In STS, the prognostic
impact of histologic response to chemotherapy is less clear, with
contradictive results, and it needs further evaluation (29–31). A
caveat in STS is that necrosis is only one type of treatment-related
tumor change. Moreover, posttreatment necrosis cannot be reli-
ably distinguished from preexisting necrosis. In this context, an
effort was recently made by the STBSG team (from EORTC) to
harmonize the interpretation of pathologic responses (19). At the
RD (10%), the median percentage of residual malignant cells was
26%.
The choice of limb sarcoma in this first phase I study was
selected because it is an easily accessible tumor to evaluate the
feasibility and safety of this product and the potential improve-
ment of radiotherapy efficacy. However, further development

main treatment option. With these promising results, this
new treatment strategy opens a new therapeutic landscape
of radioenhancement for solid tumors. This study provides
the basis for the current development of NBTXR3 in the
phase II/III trial in STS and in other phase I head and neck
cancer (NCT01946867), liver cancer (NCT02721056), and
rectal cancer (NCT02465593) trials.
