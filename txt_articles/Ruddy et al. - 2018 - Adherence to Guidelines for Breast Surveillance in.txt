Abstract
Background: Guidelines recommend annual mammography after curative-intent treatment for breast cancer. The goal of this study was to 
assess contemporary patterns of breast imaging after breast cancer treatment. Methods: Administrative claims data were used to identify 
privately insured and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries with nonmetastatic breast cancer who had residual breast tissue (not bilateral 
mastectomy) after breast surgery between January 2005 and May 2015. We calculated the proportion of patients who had a mammogram, 
MRI, both, or neither during each of 5 subsequent 13-month periods. Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess associations be-
tween patient characteristics, healthcare use, and breast imaging in the first and fifth years after surgery. Results: A total of 27,212 patients 
were followed for a median of 2.9 years (interquartile range, 1.8–4.6) after definitive breast cancer surgery. In year 1, 78% were screened 
using mammography alone, 1% using MRI alone, and 8% using both tests; 13% did not undergo either. By year 5, the proportion of the 
remaining cohort (n=4,790) who had no breast imaging was 19%. Older age was associated with an increased likelihood of mammography 
and a decreased likelihood of MRI during the first and fifth years. Black race, mastectomy, chemotherapy, and no MRI at baseline were all 
associated with a decreased likelihood of both types of imaging. Conclusions: Even in an insured cohort, a substantial proportion of breast 
cancer survivors do not undergo annual surveillance breast imaging, particularly as time passes. Understanding factors associated with 
imaging in cancer survivors may help improve adherence to survivorship care guidelines.

Breast cancer survivors who have residual breast tissue 
are recommended to undergo mammographic surveil-
lance annually. ASCO, the American Cancer Society 
(ACS), and NCCN recommend annual mammograms 
beginning at 1 year after the mammogram that led to the 
cancer diagnosis, and at least 6 months after the comple-
tion of postlumpectomy radiation.1–3 It has been shown 
that mammographic detection of asymptomatic recur-

rences is associated with earlier disease stage and in-
creased overall survival.4–7 
In contrast to the consistent recommendation 
for mammography of residual breast tissue in this 
setting, ACS, ASCO, and NCCN state that there 
is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against 
MRI for routine breast cancer surveillance.1–3 Ac-
cording to guidelines, breast MRI should never be 
used instead of mammography, and only in addi-
tion to mammograms for those with a >20% lifetime 
breast cancer risk based on very strong family histo-
ry, with a known cancer predisposition syndrome, or 
who had radiation therapy to the chest between ages 
10 and 30 years. Evidence to support MRIs among 
breast cancer survivors is limited,8,9 but a recent case 
series study suggested that MRI may be more specific 
in breast cancer survivors than in women with only 
genetic risk or a strong family history.10
Real-world adherence to breast imaging guide-
lines among mixed-age women with breast cancer 
has been understudied in the United States. In wom-
en aged >65 years diagnosed with stage I–II breast 
cancer between 1992 and 1999, a SEER-Medicare 
analysis revealed that only 78% underwent mam-
mography during months 7 to 18 after diagnosis, and 
only 57% had mammography yearly within 3 years.11 
Patients who continued to see oncology specialists 
and who were younger, white (vs black), and liv-
ing in certain regions were more likely to undergo 
mammography. Other studies have shown similar 
findings in older patients diagnosed more than a de-
cade ago, generally with only 3 to 4 years of follow-
up.12–17 A recent study using survey responses from 
1,040 breast cancer survivors aged >65 years in the 
National Health Interview Survey found that 78.9% 
self-reported receipt of a mammogram in the prior 12 
months, including only 86% of the 365 who had a life 
expectancy >10 years.18 We aimed to expand on this 
work by assessing rates and predictors of breast MRI 
and mammography in a modern cohort of mixed-age 
breast cancer survivors, and investigating how rates 
of imaging changed as time passed after diagnosis. 
Methods
Data Source
A retrospective analysis was conducted using the 
OptumLabs Data Warehouse, a large US database 
that includes administrative claims data from pri-
vately insured patients and Medicare Advantage en-
rollees across all 50 states and of all ages and ethnic 
and racial groups. Administrative claims are avail-
able on >100 million enrollees and include medical 
claims for professional (eg, physician), facility (eg, 
hospital), and outpatient pharmacy claims.19,20 The 
Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board deemed this 
study exempt from review. 
Study Population
We identified all women with newly diagnosed non-
metastatic breast cancer treated with breast surgery 
(lumpectomy or unilateral mastectomy) between 
January 1, 2005, and May 1, 2015, using previously 
validated claims-based algorithms.21,22 Patients were 
required to be age ≥18 years and have at least 12 
months of continuous health plan coverage before 
their first breast cancer diagnosis and for 13 months 
following the definitive breast surgery (without diag-
nosis of metastatic breast cancer during that period). 
Those who received bilateral mastectomy within 
18 months of their original diagnosis were excluded 
from this cohort (n=4,848). All types of systemic 
therapy (or lack thereof) were allowed. 
Independent Variables
For each patient, we assessed demographic and clini-
cal characteristics at baseline diagnosis of breast 
cancer, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic 
region (characterized as Northeast, Midwest, South, 
West, and other/unknown), local therapy type 
(lumpectomy followed by radiation, lumpectomy 
alone, mastectomy alone, mastectomy followed by 
radiation), receipt of chemotherapy, whether a pri-
mary care provider (PCP) or hematology/oncology 
visit occurred during the year of follow-up, and total 
number of medical comorbidities captured by ICD-
9 codes on claims occurring within 12 months be-
fore breast cancer diagnosis. Comorbid conditions 
at baseline were identified using previously defined 
Elixhauser algorithms, which consider 32 specific 
conditions.23 
Outcomes
The primary outcome was women having had at least 
1 “diagnostic” or “screening” mammography claim 
(Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] code 77055, 
77056, 77057, 76090, 76091, or 76092; or Health-
care Common Procedure Coding System [HCPCS]

code G0202, G0204, or G0206) during a 13-month 
enrollment span after surgery for breast cancer. We 
used 13 months to define each year of follow-up out 
of recognition that it is not always possible to sched-
ule annual tests exactly 12 months apart. For women 
with ≥13 months of continuous enrollment after 
their breast surgery, we looked for a mammogram in 
each sequential 13-month period up to 10 years. Sec-
ondary outcomes included the presence of at least 
one breast MRI (CPT code 76093, 76094, 77058, 
or 77059; or HCPCS code C8903–C8908) during 
each 13-month span. For women with >13 months 
of continuous enrollment after breast surgery, follow-
up was censored at time of loss of insurance cover-
age, metastatic breast cancer diagnosis (defined by 
ICD-10 code C79.X, or ICD-9 code 197.0–197.3, 
197.4–197.6, 197.7, 197.8, 198.0–198.2, 198.3, 
198.4, 198.5, 198.6–198.7, 198.82, 198.89, 199.0), 
or surgical removal of residual breast tissue. Only pa-
tients who were not censored before or during each 
13-month period were included in the rate calcu-
lations for that period. In a secondary analysis, we 
calculated the mean, SD, median, and interquartile 
range (IQR) for the number of mammograms per 
person per year of follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
We described the baseline characteristics of the co-
hort by imaging type (mammogram alone, mammo-
gram and MRI, MRI alone, or no breast imaging)

during the first 13-month period of follow-up after 
surgery. Characteristics were presented descriptively. 
We calculated the percentage of women who had at 
least one mammogram and/or MRI during each subse-
quent 13-month period of follow-up. We assessed the 
proportion who received each of the 4 imaging types 
during the first 13-month follow-up period for each 
year of breast surgery from January 2005–May 2015. 
We estimated multinomial logistic regression 
models for the first year imaging tests for everyone 
and for the fifth year imaging tests for those who 
were continuously covered for at least 65 months 
after breast surgery (n=4,790). Via this method, 
we were able to evaluate each surveillance modal-
ity (mammogram, mammogram and MRI, and MRI 
only) compared with no surveillance. SAS 9.3 (SAS 
Institute Inc.) was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
The cohort included 27,212 women followed for a 
median of 2.9 years (IQR, 1.8–4.6). Patient charac-
teristics are displayed in Table 1. We found that the 
proportion of women excluded from this cohort due 
to bilateral mastectomies within 18 months after di-
agnosis increased from 25.9% in 2005 to 48.9% in 
2014. A total of 4,790 patients remained part of the 
cohort through at least 65 months of follow-up.
Mammography 
After surgery from 2005–2015, mammography rates 
during the first year of follow-up remained relatively 
stable (Figure 1). Over the entire study period, 86% 
of women underwent mammography during year 1, 
87% during year 2, 85% during year 3, 83% during 
year 4, and 80% during year 5 after the definitive 
breast surgery (Figure 2). Predictors of mammogra-
phy use are shown in Table 2. The average number 
of mammograms per person per year was 1.04 (SD, 
0.51), and the median was 1.00 (IQR, 0.75–1.35). 
MRI 
Over the years, the percentage of patients who 
underwent MRI in the first year after diagnosis de-
creased from 8% of those diagnosed in 2005 to 5% 
of those diagnosed in 2015, with a peak at 15% in 
2007 (Figure 1). Over the entire study period, in 
the first year of follow-up, 2,428 (9%) underwent 
MRI; this proportion was 10% in year 2, 9% in year 
3, 8% in year 4, and 7% in year 5 (Figure 2). Pre-
dictors of MRI use during the first year are shown 
in Table 2. 
Longitudinal Surveillance After Treatment
Among the 4,790 patients who had complete follow-
up for 5 years postsurgery, 50.2% had a mammogram 
all 5 years, 1.3% had both a mammogram and an MRI

all 5 years, 3.4% had no mammogram or MRI all 5 
years, and the remaining 45.6% switched between 
different types of surveillance (or no surveillance) 
in different years. No women received a MRI only 
during all 5 years of follow-up. Predictors of breast 
imaging during the fifth year are shown in Table 3. 
Discussion 
Summary of Findings
Approximately 6 of every 7 breast cancer survivors 
underwent a mammogram in their first year of follow-
up, regardless of their year of initial surgical treat-
ment. This is higher than the <60% rate of annual 
mammography reported in women aged 50 to 64 years 
who had not previously been diagnosed with breast 
cancer.24 However, as women became long-term sur-
vivors, they were less likely to undergo mammogra-
phy, even in the absence of any change in insurance 
status, and even in this relatively young cohort. This 
finding confirms and expands on previous studies 
showing a significant decline in mammography rates 
in the fourth or fifth year after treatment.12,13,15–17,25–27 
Our study is novel because it assessed MRI use both 
in combination with mammography and as a stand-
alone breast surveillance strategy. Given the paucity 
of data to support breast MRI use in cancer survivors 
without deleterious BRCA mutations,8,9 it is not sur-
prising that most women with residual breast tissue 
in the OptumLabs database did not undergo annual 
MRIs to screen for local recurrences or new primary 
cancers. 
Factors Associated With Surveillance 
Mammography
Determinants of mammography underuse in this 
population are poorly understood to date. Among 
1,304 Italian patients with breast cancer, 80% had 
a mammogram and/or clinical breast examination 
during the first year after treatment, but this de-
creased to 67% at 10 years of follow-up.28 Like us, 
those investigators identified that patients who had 
undergone mastectomy and had more comorbidi-
ties were more likely to not undergo surveillance 
mammography. Unlike us, they found that older 
age was associated with a lower likelihood of mam-
mography. This may reflect national differences in 
healthcare policies and patterns. We were unable 
to assess whether poorer finances and longer travel 
time to the hospital (which were significant pre-
dictors the Italian study) were also associated with 
lower odds of having mammography in the United 
States. The Italian study did not evaluate the rel-

survey of 298 women in Arizona and Colorado ap-
proximately 6 years after diagnosis found no differ-
ences in self-reported mammography rates related 
to provider type.29 Our findings are more consistent 
with those of Keating et al11 and Brawarsky et al,14 
who reported that in survivors of invasive or non-
invasive breast cancer diagnosed at age >65 years 
(using SEER-Medicare data), visits to PCPs and 
oncologists increased the likelihood of surveillance 
mammography. In general, similar baseline factors 
remained predictive of mammograms in the fifth 
year of follow-up as in the first year of follow-up.

of women did undergo MRIs without mammograms. 
The use of MRIs in this setting (either with or with-
out mammogram) was greatest from 2006 through 
2007 (14.4%–14.5%), and has been slowly decreas-
ing since 2008, to a low of 5.4% in 2015. This may be 
related to the increasing popularity of bilateral mas-
tectomies. The proportion of women with mastecto-
mies from this cohort due to bilateral mastectomies 
within 18 months after diagnosis increased from 
25.9% in 2005 to 48.9% in 2014, likely rendering 
more of the women at high risk of second primary 
cancers (ie, due to a known deleterious BRCA muta-
tion, an indication for MRI surveillance of residual

breast tissue) as having no need for breast surveil-
lance. Although data are scant, it is likely that breast 
MRI in addition to mammography is more valuable 
for patients with deleterious BRCA mutations and/
or strong family histories of breast cancer. Another 
cause of the recent decline in MRI rates in survivors 
may be a concomitant decline in MRI rates at the 
time of breast cancer diagnosis due to the COMICE 
randomized controlled trial data (published in 2010, 
but presented orally in 2008) showing that MRI at 
the time of breast cancer diagnosis did not reduce re-
operation rate.30 Changing insurance guidelines also 
may have played a part in the decline of MRI rates.

Further research is needed to explore how variability 
in reimbursements for imaging tests may impact sur-
veillance testing. 
Age and Comorbidity
Younger patients may be more likely to have MRIs 
and less likely to have mammograms due to their 
denser breast tissue, which reduces sensitivity of mam-
mography. A recent study showed that adding MRIs 
to mammograms improved sensitivity but reduced 
specificity in women <50 years of age after breast-
conservation therapy.31 Going forward, the increasing 
availability of 3-dimensional mammography may re-
duce the use of MRIs in this setting. Our finding that 
≥3 comorbidities reduced the chance of both mam-
mography and MRI is not surprising given that the 
benefits of surveillance are likely greatest in women 
without a substantial competing risk of mortality from 
another disease. The lower likelihood of breast imag-
ing during the first 13 months after surgery in those 
who underwent mastectomy and chemotherapy may 
be related to lasting toxicities that made it more dif-
ficult for patients to return for breast surveillance. 
Racial Disparities
Our finding that black breast cancer survivors were 
less likely to undergo surveillance breast mammo-
gram or MRI may be a contributor to the elevated 
rates of breast cancer mortality that have been iden-
tified in black women.32 Given that locoregional re-
currences appear to be one of the major drivers of 
poor prognosis in black women,33,34 lack of imaging 
may be a substantial problem. Reasons for this are 
unclear, but socioeconomic status, comorbidities, 
lack of social support, and differences in healthcare 
beliefs may be relevant. Tammemagi35 found that 
comorbidities were present in 86% of black patients 
with breast cancer and only 65.7% of white patients 
(P<.001) at a large Detroit medical center, and 
therefore an inability to completely control for co-
morbidities using claims data may have heightened 
the racial disparities we identified. In our cohort, all 
patients were insured, but we were unable to control 
for socioeconomic status, which could affect access 
to breast imaging due to both transportation diffi-
culties, particularly in rural areas, and out-of-pocket 
costs. A deleterious BRCA mutation in a survivor 
who decides not to undergo bilateral mastectomy is 
a strong indication for breast MRI; thus, it is possible 
that limited access to genetic testing also contributes 
to the racial disparities in MRI use seen here. How-
ever, genetic testing disparities should not impact 
mammography rates in this cohort. 
Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths of this study include its large size, re-
gional and racial diversity, mixed-age population, 
and novel and important focus. Limitations include 
its claims-based methodology, precluding a full un-
derstanding of patient and tumor factors that may 
impact imaging choices. For example, reasons for 
greater MRI use in certain regions are unknown 
and will require further study. Because coding for 
“diagnostic” versus “screening” imaging is not al-
ways accurate, we are also unable to clearly discern 
how imaging rates may have been impacted by the 
Affordable Care Act mandate that screening, but 
not diagnostic mammograms, be fully covered. Ad-
ditionally, our study may have been underpowered 
to detect certain disparities (eg, between Hispanic 
vs white patients). Our inability to include unin-
sured women prevents generalization to the entire 
US population. Moreover, changes over >3 years 
could only be assessed in the minority. In addition, 
we were unable to discern which of the mammo-
grams/MRIs were performed as part of a routine sur-
veillance strategy versus in response to a symptom, 
an abnormality detected during examination, or 
a finding on another imaging test (ie, some MRIs 
may have been used to workup an abnormality de-
tected on a routine mammogram). During the first 
year, some imaging tests may have been performed 
postoperatively to assess for residual abnormalities 
rather than as surveillance for new abnormalities. 
Furthermore, some MRIs may have been performed 
due to a known deleterious BRCA mutation.
Implications for Healthcare Professionals  
and Patients
Use of MRI-based surveillance (which is not indi-
cated for most survivors) is relatively rare, particu-
larly in recent years. However, it is concerning that 
even in an insured cohort, many breast cancer sur-
vivors do not undergo their annual recommended 
surveillance mammography, especially as more time 
passes after breast cancer diagnosis. This may reflect 
that the data supporting annual surveillance mam-
mography (rather than mammography every 18–24

months, for example) are sparse, perhaps leading 
some clinicians to recommend less frequent imag-
ing for patient convenience.36 Still, our finding will 
be important for healthcare professionals who wish 
to encourage annual mammography in this setting. 
It implies that certain patients may need additional 
supports and encouragement to adhere to national 
guidelines. Universal implementation of survivor-
ship care plans that include clear follow-up recom-
mendations may be helpful.
