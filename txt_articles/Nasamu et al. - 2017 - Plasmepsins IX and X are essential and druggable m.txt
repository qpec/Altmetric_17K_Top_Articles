Proteases of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum have long been investigated
as drug targets. The P. falciparum genome encodes 10 aspartic proteases called
plasmepsins, which are involved in diverse cellular processes. Most have been studied
extensively but the functions of plasmepsins IX and X (PMIX and PMX) were unknown.
Here we show that PMIX is essential for erythrocyte invasion, acting on rhoptry
secretory organelle biogenesis. In contrast, PMX is essential for both egress and
invasion, controlling maturation of the subtilisin-like serine protease SUB1 in exoneme
secretory vesicles. We have identified compounds with potent antimalarial activity
targeting PMX, including a compound known to have oral efficacy in a mouse model
of malaria.
C
onsiderable work has gone into the synthe-
sis of plasmepsin inhibitors as antimalarials
(1–4). Most efforts have been directed at the
digestive vacuole plasmepsins I to IV (PMI
to PMIV) because of the availability of crys-
tal structures and recombinant proteins. How-
ever, genetic knockouts reveal that these are not
essential for parasite survival (5). Thus, rationally
designed inhibitors of PMI to PMIV likely exert
their antimalarial effects through other targets
(1, 3). PMV, PMIX, and PMX are the only other
plasmepsins expressed in asexual blood-stage
parasites (6). PMV is an essential protease that
processes proteins for export into the host eryth-
rocyte and is a focus of ongoing drug development
efforts (7–9). PMV is, however, quite divergent
from the other plasmepsins (10), and most di-
gestive vacuole plasmepsin inhibitors are not po-
tent against this enzyme (11). PMI to PMIV share
more sequence homology to PMIX and PMX
(10). PMIX and PMX could be the targets of di-
gestive vacuole plasmepsin inhibitors that have
antimalarial activity.
To characterize the functions of PMIX and
PMX in the biology of blood-stage Plasmodium
falciparum parasites, we used new TetR-aptamer
conditional knockdown (KD) technology (12)
(fig. S1), enabling translational repression of the
target gene when anhydrotetracycline (aTc) is
removed from the culture. Using CRISPR-Cas9
editing, we installed the TetR-aptamer regula-
tory system at the PMIX and PMX loci to create
PMIXapt and PMXapt lines (fig. S1). When aTc
levels were lowered in synchronous, early ring-
stage parasites, we observed a major decrease in
target protein levels in late-stage schizonts, in
both PMIXapt and PMXapt (Fig. 1A). This led
to decreased replication, revealing a critical role
for both of these enzymes in parasite survival
(Fig. 1B).
To determine the stage at which the defect
occurred, cell cycle progression was monitored
using highly synchronous ring-stage parasites
cultured under KD (–aTc) or induced (+aTc)
conditions. Flow cytometry revealed that both
PMIXapt and PMXapt developed normally until
they reached segmented schizonts (~44 hours).
At the end of the cycle (between 46 to 52 hours),
similar numbers of PMIXapt schizonts had egressed,
irrespective of PMIX expression status. How-
ever, –aTc cultures featured about one-fourth as
many new rings (Fig. 1C). A similar fourfold de-
crease was seen in –aTc PMXapt cultures (Fig. 1D).
Unlike for PMIXapt, at 52 hours, 80% of PMXapt
parasites had egressed in +aTc cultures, whereas
only 36% had egressed in –aTc cultures. Even
taking the egress defect into account, however,
we observed fewer rings than expected, indicat-
ing an additional invasion phenotype. We further
characterized this by live microscopy of individual
cells (13) (Fig. 1E) and observed similar egress
and invasion impairment (Fig. 1F). Unruptured
schizonts accumulated in the –aTc culture as
merozoite clusters and some distorted schizonts;
occasionally, these partially ruptured or displayed
defective merozoite dispersal (Fig. 1G). Of the
parasites that could egress in a normal time frame
under –aTc conditions, the merozoite invasion
rate was ~50% of that observed in the presence
of aTc (Fig. 1F). These data implicate PMIX in
erythrocyte invasion and PMX in both egress
and invasion. A PMIXapt-PMXapt double aptamer–
tagged line displayed a similar defect in egress
and a greater block in invasion, yielding a sev-
enfold decrease in new rings (fig. S2). The data
imply independent contributions of PMIX and
PMX to these processes.
To evaluate the subcellular localization of these
proteins, we engineered epitope tags on the 3′
end of the endogenous genes (fig. S3) and per-
formed immuno–electron microscopy. PMIX was
found largely in the bulbs of rhoptry secretory
organelles that are involved in invasion (14) (Fig. 2,
A and B). PMX was found in exonemes—small,
ovoid secretory vesicles that discharge during
egress into the parasitophorous vacuole surround-
ing the parasite (15) (Fig. 2, C to E).
The localization studies guided us to examine
organellar proteins whose processing could be
affected by PM action. RAP1 is a rhoptry bulb
protein that is processed from an 84-kDa pre-
cursor to 82- and 67-kDa forms. The PMIXapt line
failed to process the precursor efficiently when
aTc was withdrawn (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the
rhoptry neck protein RON4 was processed de-
spite PMIX KD. By electron microscopy, a rhoptry
biogenesis defect was evident under KD condi-
tions (Fig. 2, F and G).
The subtilisin-like serine protease SUB1 is an
exonemal protein that plays a critical role in
egress and invasion (15, 16). SUB1 is synthesized
as an 82-kDa zymogen that rapidly self-processes
into a 54-kDa semi-proenzyme in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). The cleaved prodomain remains
bound to the 54-kDa protein and inhibits activity
(17). A second processing step converts the 54-kDa
form into a 47-kDa mature protein. This step can
occur autocatalytically in vitro but is slow and
partial (18, 19). A processing enzyme has been
postulated for this step (20), but its identity is
unclear. Notably, a major defect in SUB1 process-
ing was observed in PMXapt (Fig. 3B) but not
PMIXapt (fig. S4) after aTc withdrawal, indicating
that PMX is important for the final SUB1 pro-
cessing step. Consistent with this, PMX is synthe-
sized and processed shortly before SUB1 synthesis
and processing occurs (Fig. 3C). Similar to the sec-
ond processing step of SUB1, PMX maturation
is blocked by brefeldin A (fig. S5), suggesting a
post-ER event.
During egress, SUB1 processes a family of cys-
teine proteases (SERAs) and a family of merozoite
surface proteins (MSPs) (15, 16). SERA5 is synthe-
sized as a 126-kDa protein and is processed se-
quentially by SUB1 into 73-and 56-kDa forms. The
latter is further processed into a 50-kDa fragment
in a SUB1-independent process (21). We assessed
SERA5 in PMXapt parasites. In the absence of aTc,
SERA5 accumulated in the 126-kDa form with
very little processing to other intermediates
(Fig. 3D). Similarly, MSP1 accumulated as its
193-kDa precursor (fig. S6). Thus, PMX KD im-
pairs downstream egress events.

 We tested whether PMX is an active protease
by introducing an ectopic gene copy (Fig. 3, E
and F, and fig. S7). PMXapt parasites constitutively
expressing a second-copy PMX gene with an
active site aspartate mutation [Asp266→Gly266
(D266G)] had reduced growth in the absence of
aTc and were unable to restore processing of
SUB1. In contrast, those expressing a wild-type
second-copy gene were rescued. These data show
that PMX enzymatic activity in vivo is crucial to
its function. The catalytic mutant PMX was pro-
cessed to the mature form, suggesting a trans-
processing event (fig. S7B).
Many aspartic protease inhibitors with anti-
malarial properties have been investigated, but
the specific targets for most of them are unknown
(1). Three aminohydantoins that caused schizont
accumulation reminiscent of our PMX KD pheno-
type were identified [TCMD-134675 and TCMD-
136879 from the TCAMS collection (22) and
CWHM-117 (11)]. To evaluate whether these com-
pounds act in a PMIX- or PMX-dependent man-
ner, dose-response curves were determined for KD
parasites. The half-maximal effective concentration
values were substantially lower for PMXapt but not
PMIXapt cultured in low-aTc conditions (Fig. 4, A
and B). This indicates hypersensitivity of PMXapt
parasites to aminohydantoins when PMX expres-
sion is low. Egress and invasion were blocked,
and an accumulation of abnormal schizonts was
observed by live-cell microscopy as shown with
CWHM-117 (Fig. 4, C and D). Further, treatment
of parasites with each of these inhibitors blocked
SUB1 and SERA5 maturation (Fig. 4E), as was
seen with PMX KD. Treatment with aminohydan-
toins did not block the initial SUB1 autoprocess-
ing step. The compounds also did not inhibit
PMX maturation (Fig. 4E). Recombinant PMX
cleaved a fluorogenic peptide as well as SUB1
protein in vitro, and these reactions were blocked
by aminohydantoins (Fig. 4F and fig. S9), with
median inhibitory concentration values from 175
to 800 nM in the peptide assay. Combining PMX
KD and inhibitor treatment resulted in a complete
block of egress and SUB1 maturation (Fig. 4, G
and H). Because CWHM-117 has oral efficacy in
a mouse model (11), it appears that PMX is a
promising target for antimalarial chemotherapy.
We have determined that PMIX and PMX are
essential for parasite egress and invasion. PMIX
localizes to the rhoptries and could be a maturase
for proteins in this organelle. We have discovered
that PMX is required for SUB1 processing, making
PMX the most upstream protease known in the
egress cascade (Fig. 4I). However, it is not clear
that the final cleavage of SUB1 is a direct action
of PMX; if so, it could result from processing of
semi-pro SUB1 or from cleavage of the prodomain,
liberating semi-pro SUB1 to process itself. PMX is
capable of cleaving SUB1 in vitro (fig. S9), adding
some support to the direct-cleavage model.
PMX does not appear to autoprocess (Fig. 4E
and fig. S7B), unlike most aspartic proteases,
which suggests that there may be another still-
undiscovered maturase upstream in the proteolytic
cascade of egress. We have identified compounds
