ABSTRACT  
Objective: To characterize youth who use the emergency department (ED) as a “first contact” 
for mental health (MH) problems.  
Method: Population-based cross-sectional cohort study using linked health and demographic 
administrative datasets of youth ages 10-24 years with an incident MH ED visit from April 1, 
2010 to March 31, 2014 in Ontario, Canada. We modeled the association of demographic, 
clinical, and health service use characteristics with having no prior outpatient MH care in the 
preceding 2-year period (“first contact”) using modified Poisson models.  
Results: Among 118,851 youth with an incident mental health ED visit, 14.0% were admitted. 
Over half (53.5%) had no prior outpatient MH care, and this was associated with younger age 
(14-17 vs 22-24 years old: risk ratio [RR] 1.09, 95% CI 1.07-1.10), rural residence (RR 1.16, 
95% CI 1.14-1.18), lowest vs highest income quintile (RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.06), and refugee 
immigrants (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.13-1.21) and other immigrants (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.08-1.13) vs 
non-immigrants. The 5.1% of the cohort without a usual provider of primary care had the highest 
risk of first contact (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.77-1.80). A history of low acuity ED use and those 
whose primary care physicians were in the lowest tertile for mental health visit volumes were 
associated with higher risk.  
Conclusion: Over half of youth requiring ED care have not previously sought outpatient MH 
care. Associations with multiple markers of primary care access characteristics suggest timely 
primary care could prevent some of these visits.

youth.1,2 One in five children have a MH condition, yet less than 20% of affected children 
receive adequate services.3,4 In North America, up to 3% of all pediatric emergency department 
(ED) visits5-7 and 10% of all hospital admissions are MH related.8 While the overall prevalence 
of MH conditions in youth has remained relatively stable,9 the rate of health service use, ED 
visits, and hospital admissions are increasing.6,10,11  
Up to half of children and youth who present to the ED have no previous psychiatric 
history or contact with the MH care system.12,13 These ED visits for MH-related concerns 
without prior MH care contact have been described as “first contact” ED visits.14 First contact 
ED visits have been used as a health system performance indicator measuring access to MH 
care.14 While emergency services are important for managing MH crises, the rise in ED visits 
observed in children and youth and the high rate of first contact suggests that access to timely 
outpatient MH care is an important issue.10,14 In adults, individuals with first contact ED visits 
for psychosis have poor clinical outcomes, such as more severe disease at presentation and 
higher future use of acute care services,15 but less is known about the phenomenon of first-
contact ED visits in youth and for other MH problems. First contact may be due to a failure by 
families to recognize MH conditions before crisis,12,16 parental request for urgent or timely 
diagnostic evaluation,12 lack of access or knowledge about how to access services, reluctance to 
discuss concerns with primary care physician,17 or reduced proficiency in English.18 Ethnicity 
and socioeconomic status are associated with increased use of ED services for MH 
conditions,4,5,19-21 but it is unclear if these are also risk factors for first contact. Lastly, certain 
MH conditions may present acutely (e.g. alcohol intoxication), and first contact may be 
unavoidable.

understand if EDs are being used for MH problems due to outpatient access issues and to better 
align emergency services with need. Therefore, the aims of this study are to describe 
demographic, clinical, and primary care provider characteristics of children and youth with first-
time ED visits for MH problems and test associations of these characteristics with whether there 
was previous outpatient care for MH problems in a population-based cross-sectional study from 
Ontario, whose population of 13 million represents 40% of the Canadian population.  
METHOD 
Study Design and Setting 
This was a population-based cross-sectional study of a cohort of youth presenting to an 
ED in Ontario, Canada using data available through a research agreement with the Ontario 
Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences 
(ICES). In Ontario, most hospital and physician services are funded through the single payer 
Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP). Research ethics board approval was obtained from The 
Hospital for Sick Children and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Ontario. 
Data Sources 
A number of linked health administrative and demographic datasets available at ICES 
were used for study data. ICES data holdings link individual patient records from health care 
services including ED visits, inpatient hospitalizations, and outpatient visits using encoded 
identifiers. The National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) was used to identify 
MH-related ED visits according to discharge diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases 
[ICD] 10th Revision codes).22 The Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract 
Database (CIHI – DAD) and the Ontario Mental Health Reporting System (for designated mental 
health hospital beds) were used to evaluate clinical information for patients with MH-related

hospital admissions.23 The OHIP claims database contains information on outpatient billings by 
physicians in Ontario and was used to determine MH-related outpatient visits, primary care 
utilization, and provider characteristics. The Client Agency Program Enrolment (CAPE) 
database was used to describe patient enrollment with primary care groups and patient 
enrollment models. The ICES Physician Database (IPDB) provided information about physician 
characteristics.  
The Ontario Registered Persons Database (RPDB) was used to identify postal code of 
residence, which was linked to 2006 Canadian Census data to obtain neighbourhood income 
quintile data at the level of a dissemination area (400-700 people). The Ontario portion of the 
federally maintained Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s Permanent Resident Data 
System (PRDS) was used to characterize those who were immigrants and refugees up until 
March 31, 2012. All patient data are deterministically linked by an encoded health insurance 
number. Probabilistic linkage of the immigrant dataset and the RPDB is 86% and has been 
described in detail elsewhere.24  
Study Population 
The study included all youth ages 10 to 24 years old living in Ontario who had an 
unscheduled incident ED visit for an MH condition (ICD-10 codes F04-F99, X60-84, Y10-Y19 
or Y28) from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2014. An incident ED visit was defined as an ED visit 
for an MH disorder without a prior MH-related ED visit or hospitalization in the two preceding 
years. This exclusion was to restrict our population to those with a first or new emergency MH 
crisis. Duplicated, overlapping, and transferred ED visits were excluded. Records of non-Ontario 
residents, or those with a missing or invalid health card number, age, or sex were excluded. 
Children and youth whose primary care is delivered in a community health centre for which 
 MANUSCRIPT

there are no administrative records of visits available, those with less than two years of OHIP 
eligibility prior to index event, and those whose usual provider of primary care (UPC) speciality 
was missing were also excluded.  
Outcome  
The primary outcome was a mental health ED visit without prior outpatient physician 
care for MH problems (“first contact visit”), operationalized as one or more outpatient visits for 
an MH-related disorder to a primary care provider (general practitioner/family physician 
[GP/FP] or pediatrician) or any visit to a psychiatrist in the two years preceding the incident ED 
visit. We used an algorithm to define MH visits validated in adults and modified for children.25 
The algorithm uses physician billing data to define an MH visit as an outpatient visit claim with 
an MH diagnostic code.  
Predictors 
A number of variables that, based on the literature or clinical plausibility, are potentially 
associated with MH disorders or access to MH care were included. Age, sex, socioeconomic 
status (neighborhood income quintiles), and rural residence were included as covariates given 
their known association with access to MH care.1,11 Rurality Index of Ontario (RIO) score was 
used to determine whether patients live in urban (RIO <39) or rural (RIO ≥40) areas.26 Mental 
health morbidity and service use vary by immigration status1,27 and were assessed using two 
main variables: 1) immigration status (non-immigrant, immigrant non-refugee, and immigrant 
refugee); and 2) time since arriving in Canada, defined as number of years from landing in 
Canada to incident ED visit (recent = 0 to ≤5 years, intermediate >5 years and ≤10 years, and 
long-term >10 years).28,29

low-acuity ED visits, or the tendency to use emergency services for less urgent causes, has been 
shown to reflect primary care access.31 Both all-cause ED visits and all low-acuity ED visits for 
children and youth in the two years prior to the incident ED visit were measured and categorized 
as none, 1, 2, or ≥3 ED visits. To determine the frequency of outpatient primary care health 
service use prior to first contact, visits to a primary care provider in the two years prior to the ED 
visit were assessed and divided into tertiles. For youth with a prior outpatient MH visit, the 
number of visits to a psychiatrist in the two years prior to the ED visit was described.  
In Ontario, significant reform to primary delivery has occurred with the creation of 
several primary care models32 to improve patient access with financial incentives to provide 
after-hours care.33 GP/FPs not enrolled in a model are remunerated by fee-for-service (FFS). 
Pediatricians provide some primary care but have not been included in primary care reform; they 
are remunerated by FFS and have no requirement to provide after-hours care. The primary care 
reform did not include behavioural health integration or specific MH-focused initiatives, 
although some practices may have chosen to use additional available funding to invest in MH 
services such as those from a social worker. UPC was assigned, as in previous work,34 in the 
following manner. Those rostered in a primary care model were assigned to that provider. For 
non-rostered individuals, an algorithm using all primary care billings for the preceding two years 
was used to assign the physician with the highest dollar value of primary care billings for each 
patient. For non-rostered youth, those with no primary care use were considered to have no UPC. 
We categorized each assigned UPC as GP/FP model, GP/FP no model, pediatrician or no UPC. 
We hypothesized that patients rostered in primary care models would have better access to MH 
care.  
Characteristics of the assigned UPC, including age, sex, type of physician (GP/FP or

pediatrician), years in practice, foreign-trained, full-time/part-time designation, rurality of 
practice and practice-level MH volume, were included. Mental health volume was determined 
based on the average annualized volume of distinct outpatient MH-related visits per calendar 
year for youth aged 10-24 years for the number of years that physician has been in practice; 
tertiles were used to create categories. We hypothesized that physicians with more activity in 
MH might be more experienced at identifying MH problems. 
Based on the ED record, MH disorders were categorized into: 1) acute stress disorder; 2) 
anxiety; 3) eating disorders; 4) mood/affective disorder; 5) substance-related disorders; 6) self-
harm; 7) schizophrenia, delusional and non-organic psychotic disorders; 8) select childhood 
disorders (e.g. autism spectrum disorder); 9) select personality and behavior disorders; and 10) 
other MH-related disorders (see Supplement 1 and Table S1, available online, for mutually 
exclusive ICD-10 codes used). All visits were assigned a Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale 
(CTAS) score, a standardized measure assigned when ED patients are triaged, categorized as low 
(CTAS score 4 or 5) or high acuity (CTAS score 1, 2 or 3).35  
ED visit time and day of week were used to explore the impact of availability of 
outpatient services (e.g. after-hours clinic). Visits were categorized based on multiple services 
likely available (08:01-16:00 Monday-Friday), few services available (16:01-24:00 Monday-
Friday, or 08:01-16:00 Saturday/Sunday) or ED main place to seek care (00:01-08:00 Tuesday-
Saturday, or 16:01-08:00 Saturday/Sunday). Similarly, ED visits were categorized by weekday 
or weekend/statutory holiday (defined by Ontario Ministry of Labour).

between groups were assessed using chi-square test for categorical data and one-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) for continuous data. Poisson modelling using robust error variance variances 
using a priori selected variables were used to determine predictors of first-contact ED visits. 
Table S2, available online, summarizes how missing data were handled. To explore 
characteristics of primary care providers associated with first contact, we did a subgroup analysis 
including only those patients with a usual provider of primary care. Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted by stratifying the results by only those children and youth admitted to hospital to 
ensure robustness of findings and relevance to more acutely ill youth. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% 
CIs are reported. All analyses were conducted in SAS Enterprise guide version 6.1 (SAS 
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). 
RESULTS 
Following exclusions (Figure 1), we included 118,851 youth with a first-time ED visit for 
an MH problem between 2010 and 2014, of which 16,666 (14.0%) were hospitalized and 40 died 
in the ED. Most visits were due to substance-related disorder (26.6%), anxiety (20.4%), 
mood/affective disorders (18.2%), and acute stress disorder (14.4%). We present the overall 
cohort by admission status in Table S3, available online, for descriptive purposes only as those 
admitted may represent a somewhat different clinical population. Only a small proportion of 
youth with an ED visit for substance-related disorders (2.7%) and anxiety (2.4%) were admitted 
to hospital while 70.1% of youth who presented with schizophrenia, delusional, and psychotic 
disorders were hospitalized.  
More than half (53.5%) of youth had no prior outpatient MH care (Table 1). ED visits for 
those with no prior MH care were more likely to be for substance-related disorders (34.3% vs 
17.8%) but less likely for mood/affective (13.5% vs 23.6%) and select childhood disorders (0.9%

vs 3.4%). In the two years preceding first contact, youth had an average of 4.2 primary care visits 
compared to 10.4 visits in those with prior MH care; 30.9% of youth with prior outpatient MH 
care had one or more visits to a psychiatrist. Of patients admitted from the ED for MH care, 
41.2% had never previously seen an outpatient provider. 
The adjusted RRs of first-contact ED visits for MH-related disorders are shown in Table 
2. Compared with non-immigrants, refugee immigrants (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.13-1.21) and non-
refugee immigrants (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.08-1.13) had greater risk of first contact. As 
neighborhood income quintile decreased, the risk of first contact increased (lowest vs highest 
income quintile; RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.06). Children and youth without a UPC were 
significantly more likely to have a first contact ED visit (no UPC vs GP/FP model; RR 1.78, 
95% CI 1.77-1.80).  
Amongst children and youth with a UPC (n=112,447), certain provider characteristics 
were associated with increased risk of first contact, including foreign training, rurality, male 
gender, and working full-time (Table 3). Provider MH practice volume had a dose response 
effect, with lower MH volume associated with higher risk of first contact. Youth with a UPC 
remunerated by FFS, in other words not part of a primary care reform model, had a 10% greater 
risk of first-contact ED visits.  
When the analysis was stratified by age group, most findings were similar to the overall 
cohort (Table S4, available online). In the 10–17-year-old group, males had a lower risk of first 
contact while the risk was elevated in the 18–24-year-olds. Neighbourhood income quintile was 
not associated with increased risk of first contact in the 10-17 age group, while it was significant 
in older youth. When the analysis was restricted to youth admitted to hospital, most findings 
were similar to those discharged from ED. The risk of no prior outpatient MH care for youth

from the lowest neighborhood income quintile was even greater.  
DISCUSSION 
In this large, population-based study, we report that over half of children and youth who 
present to the ED with a new MH condition have not previously sought MH care in an outpatient 
setting. While there was a diverse range of MH diagnoses, 81% of visits were due to anxiety, 
adjustment, mood/affective, and substance-related disorders. Given most first contact literature 
on MH conditions focuses on adults with psychotic disorders15,36 or children and youth referred 
to mental health services,37 our study fills an important gap.  
We identified several risk factors for first-contact mental health ED visits. Consistent 
with prior research on poverty and poor access to MH care,20 youth from the most deprived 
neighbourhoods were more likely to have first contact in an ED. Youth living in rural regions 
were also less likely to receive outpatient care before first ED contact. These data support 
qualitative research that reported rural adolescents may delay seeking help for MH problems due 
to concerns of gossip, perceived social proximity, and limited availability of resources.38 Youth 
with prior low-acuity ED visits were more likely to have first-contact ED visits potentially due to 
a tendency to use emergency services for less urgent causes,31,39 or this may reflect primary care 
access issues. Refugees and non-refugee immigrants were also more likely to have first contact 
visits compared to non-immigrants. First contact may be due to poor (actual or perceived) 
primary care access, reduced proficiency in English, stigma, inability to navigate the health care 
system, or a higher acuity of illness.12,16,18 Given that immigrants make up 20% of the 
population,40 our findings highlight a high-risk group that may require targeted interventions.  
It is not surprising that most youth with substance-related disorders (some of which may 
be a first-time acute intoxication) have no prior outpatient MH care, yet 43% of visits for 
 MANUSCRIPT

11
schizophrenia, delusional, and psychotic disorders were also first contact. While some ED visits 
are likely unavoidable and related to the speed of onset (i.e. episode of severe intoxication), 
others are not (e.g. newly diagnosed schizophrenia, adjustment, and anxiety disorders), and 
treatment should be initiated early in ambulatory settings. Indeed, two-thirds of children with 
substance-related disorders were first-contact visits, while under one-quarter of slower 
developing disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, were first contact. 
Most first-contact ED visits were triaged as high acuity and likely appropriate for an 
emergency care venue, but youth with mild MH problems may have evolved into severe crises 
due to poor primary care access or clinician difficulty recognizing MH symptoms.41 Indeed, we 
found youth with a primary care physician whose practice has a relatively higher volume of MH 
visits and who participate in a capitation-based primary care model that requires after-hours 
access to primary care33 had lower first-contact ED visits. The clear temporal pattern of first- 
contact ED use (76% of visits occur after 16:00 on weekdays and on weekends/holidays), similar 
to findings in other studies,21 also suggests that access to primary care may play a role.  
One striking finding in our study was the large number of primary care visits for any 
reason in youth with prior outpatient MH care (10.4 compared with 4.2 visits in two years prior 
to ED visit). Given that only 31% of children were seeing a psychiatrist, this highlights the major 
and under-recognized role of primary care in managing MH problems. The key role of primary 
care in the pathway to first diagnosis was also found in an Australian study in adults where 53% 
of patients saw a GP before receiving specialist MH care.36 However, children and youth with 
first-contact ED visits are accessing primary care for non-MH-related problems, which may 
represent a missed opportunity. Further research is needed on potential screening mechanisms42 
to identify specific MH problems earlier.

To our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate children and youth who first present 
to the ED with any MH-related condition. Unlike other studies,12,13,43,44 we minimized selection 
bias by including all MH diagnoses across a range of hospitals in a universal access health care 
system. While administrative datasets provide insights on a large population of patients, they 
have inherent limitations including potential coding errors and a lack of data on contributing 
factors (e.g. substance use), education levels, and use of non-physician community MH services 
(e.g. psychologists and social workers). We did not determine if the prior outpatient visit was for 
the same MH condition as the first-contact ED visit, nor did we determine the timing of the prior 
outpatient visit to the incident ED visit.  
Using the ED as a first point of contact for MH services is increasingly being identified 
as a health systems quality indicator.1 Our study suggests that high rates of first contact reflect 
poor access to timely MH care, much of which would be by primary care providers. While the 
ED plays an important role in crisis management, the priority is stabilization rather than 
rehabilitation, and referrals to community resources are often deferred to primary care.12 We 
identified several risk factors associated with first contact that have important implications for 
clinicians and policy makers. For over half of youth that present to the ED, emergency clinicians 
should ensure that appropriate follow-up is arranged. However, health system strategies to 
improve access to appropriate primary care and referral to specialized services as necessary to 
prevent these ED visits will also be important.  
Clinical Guidance 
·         Over half of children and youth who present to the emergency department (ED) with a 
mental health (MH) condition have not previously received outpatient physician care for MH 
problems. 
·         Many of these ED visits occur after hours, but ED staff need to have systems to ensure 
timely and adequate follow-up, especially given how many are the first presentation for MH 
problems.

·         Children and youth at greatest risk for no previous MH care include those from rural areas, 
low-income neighbourhoods, or immigrant families. 
·         Children and youth whose primary care providers have more of a focus on MH or who are 
mandated to provide after-hours access are more likely to have previously sought outpatient care 
for MH problems before presenting to the ED.

Supplement 1: Mental Health Disorder Categorization  
The following databases were used to determine mental health diagnosis: National Ambulatory Care Reporting System 
(NACRS), Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI – DAD) and the Ontario Mental 
Health Reporting System (OMHRS). OMHRS is a specific data holding at CIHI that includes specific data for inpatient 
mental health services planning. Both NACRS and CIHI – DAD use International Classification of Diseases-10th 
Revision (ICD-10-CA) codes while OMHRS uses DSM-IV-TR codes.  
 
Mental health conditions were grouped into the following categories, based on respective ICD-10-CA or DSM-IV codes 
listed in the relevant database (see Table S1):
