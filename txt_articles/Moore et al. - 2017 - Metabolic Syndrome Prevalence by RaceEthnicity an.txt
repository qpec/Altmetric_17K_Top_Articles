Abstract
Introduction
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors as-
sociated with increased risk of multiple chronic diseases, includ-
ing cancer and cardiovascular disease. The objectives of this study
were to estimate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome overall, by
race and sex, and to assess trends in prevalence from 1988 through
2012.
Methods
We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examin-
ation Survey (NHANES) for 1988 through 2012. We defined
metabolic syndrome as the presence of at least 3 of these compon-
ents: elevated waist circumference, elevated triglycerides, reduced
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high blood pressure, and el-
evated fasting blood glucose. Data were analyzed for 3 periods:
1988–1994, 1999–2006, and 2007–2012.
Results
Among US adults aged 18 years or older, the prevalence of meta-
bolic syndrome rose by more than 35% from 1988–1994 to
2007–2012, increasing from 25.3% to 34.2%. During 2007–2012,
non-Hispanic black men were less likely than non-Hispanic white
men to have metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR], 0.77; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 0.66–0.89). However, non-Hispanic black
women were more likely than non-Hispanic white women to have
metabolic syndrome (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02–1.40). Low educa-
tion level (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.32–1.84) and advanced age (OR,
1.73; 95% CI, 1.67–1.80) were independently associated with in-
creased likelihood of metabolic syndrome during 2007–2012.
Conclusion
Metabolic syndrome prevalence increased from 1988 to 2012 for
every sociodemographic group; by 2012, more than a third of all
US adults met the definition and criteria for metabolic syndrome
agreed to jointly by several international organizations.
Introduction
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of biological factors character-
ized by abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and type 2
diabetes mellitus (1). The link between metabolic syndrome and
increased risk of multiple chronic diseases (eg, cardiovascular dis-
ease, arthritis, chronic kidney disease, schizophrenia, several types
of cancer) and of early death have been reported for many dec-
ades (2–13). Complicating efforts to better understand the public
health burden of metabolic syndrome and identify prevention
strategies is the lack of consistency in the clinical definition and
categorical cut-points for component conditions. By using the
definition of metabolic syndrome from the International Diabetes
Federation (IDF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program,
the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is estimated at more than
30% in the United States; however, by using the Adult Treatment
Panel criteria, prevalence is estimated at about 22% (14–16).
The prevalence of obesity among US adults increased steadily
since the 1990s and is now at epidemic proportions, with over
two-thirds of US adults either overweight or obese (17). Concur-
rently, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension has also
steadily increased, cumulating in substantial increases in the pro-
portion of adults who likely meet the criteria for metabolic syn-
drome and are thus at increased risk for more serious chronic con-

 ditions and premature death. It is therefore urgent to understand
the trends in metabolic syndrome prevalence with the goal of
identifying etiologic factors that are subject to public health inter-
vention strategies. In recognition of this problem and to reconcile
the many definitions and categorical cut-points for metabolic syn-
drome, several organizations (IDF; National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute in the United States; American Heart Association;
World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society;
and International Association for the Study of Obesity) issued a
joint statement with a definition and criteria for metabolic syn-
drome to which they have all agreed (18).
Given what appears to be a consensus on the definition and cat-
egorical cut points for metabolic syndrome, we examined a nation-
ally representative sample of adults in the United States, estim-
ated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome overall, by race and
sex, and assessed trends in prevalence since 1988. In addition, we
determined the independent effects of socioeconomic factors on
the prevalence of metabolic syndrome.
Methods
Study design and participants
Since 1959, the National Center for Health Statistics of the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention has collected, analyzed,
and disseminated data on the health status of US residents as part
of  the  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey
(NHANES) (19). Each year NHANES surveys a nationally repres-
entative sample of about 5,000 US adults in which Mexican
Americans  and  non-Hispanic  blacks  are  oversampled,  and
weighted analysis is used to generate generalizable estimates.
NHANES collects demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and
health-related data that include clinical measures of blood pres-
sure, fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipo-
protein (HDL) cholesterol in addition to self-reported medication
use for health conditions. We conducted cross-sectional analysis
of the NHANES data and examined trends in metabolic syndrome
over time by establishing 3 periods; 1988–1994 (first period),
1999–2006 (second period), and 2007–2012 (third period). These
periods were chosen to account for the lack of continuous annual
data over the entire 24-year period (no data for 1996 through
1998) and variations in the NHANES sampling design over time.
Comparisons between periods are appropriate as long as sampling
weights and units are accounted for in statistical analyses.
Our analysis included all non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
and Mexican American adults aged 18 or older represented in the
NHANES data set during the study period. Adults of other race/
ethnicities were excluded because of limited sample sizes and in-
consistent categorizations across the survey years; pregnant wo-
men were also excluded to reduce bias associated with pregnancy-
associated diabetes or weight gain. A total of 51,371 participants
during the study period were included in this analysis; 18,552 par-
ticipants for 1988–1994, 18,445 participants for 1999–2006, and
14,374 participants for 2007–2012. The University of Alabama at
Birmingham Institutional Review Board considered this study ex-
empt from review because of the use of publicly available, de-
identified data.
We defined metabolic syndrome using the criteria and definition
published in the joint scientific statement on metabolic syndrome
(18). These criteria defined metabolic syndrome as present when 3
of these 5 components are present: 1) elevated waist circumfer-
ence (≥88 cm for women and ≥102 cm for men), 2) elevated
triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL) or drug treatment for elevated trigly-
cerides, 3) low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL for men and <50 mg/
dL for women) or drug treatment for low HDL cholesterol, 4) el-
evated blood pressure (systolic ≥130 mm Hg, or diastolic ≥85 mm
Hg, or both) or antihypertensive drug treatment for a history of hy-
pertension, and 5) elevated fasting glucose (≥100 mg/dL) or drug
treatment for elevated glucose. We defined metabolic components
using the NHANES questionnaire responses and laboratory re-
sponses listed in Appendix A. NHANES did not collect laborat-
ory values for HDL cholesterol for survey years 1999 through
2004. Therefore, we relied on self-report of drug treatment for low
HDL cholesterol. In this analysis, we calculated the estimated pro-
portion of adults who met each component criterion and who met
the formal definition of metabolic syndrome across the study peri-
ods (individuals with missing or unknown data were included in a
separate response category).
To assess sociodemographic differences in the prevalence and
trends of metabolic syndrome, we included the variables age, race/
ethnicity, education, and poverty to income ratio (PIR). Age was
assessed as a continuous variable for participants aged 0 to 84
years, and those 85 or older were classified as 85 years of age
(NHANES codes individuals 85 or older as 85 years). Race/ethni-
city was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
or Mexican American. NHANES determined education level by
the response to the question “What is the highest grade or level of
school completed or the highest degree received?” The education
variable was further categorized into less than high school gradu-
ate, high school graduate or equivalent, some college, college
graduate, or unknown/refused. PIR was calculated as the ratio of
total family income to poverty threshold values (in dollars). Per-
sons who reported having no income were assigned a zero value
for PIR. PIR values less than 1 are considered below the official
poverty line, whereas PIR values greater than 1 are above the
poverty level (20).

 Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed in 2016 using NHANES-generated
sampling statistical strata, clusters, and weights as designated and
described in detail in the NHANES methodology handbook (19).
Thus, results may be generalizable to the US population. So-
ciodemographic characteristics, prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome, and individual metabolic components were estimated while
accounting for stratum, primary sampling units, and weights
unique for each NHANES period by using SAS (version 9.4, SAS
Institute, Inc) PROC SURVEY procedures (ie, FREQ, REG, and
MEANS).
We estimated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and individu-
al  components  over  time  (1988–1994,  1999–2006,  and
2007–2012), stratified by race and sex using weighted means and
proportions. To determine the odds of metabolic syndrome adjust-
ing for potential confounders such as level of education and PIR,
we performed several logistic regression models for each period
with metabolic syndrome as the outcome and sociodemographic
variables as exposures. We performed similar analyses examining
each component of metabolic syndrome. As a sensitivity analysis,
to assess whether the increase in prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome is driven solely by increasing rates of obesity among US
adults, we determined the prevalence of metabolic syndrome
across the study period, excluding participants with body mass in-
dex (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared) of 30 or higher. We tablulated results of statistic-
al models as adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs).
Results
There  were  51,371  participants  representing  an  estimated
548,105,710 US adults aged 18 or older from 1988 through 2012
(Table 1). During the observation period, the average age of study
participants increased gradually, with mean age increasing from
about  44  years  during  1988–1994  (mean,  44.4;  95%  CI,
43.4–45.5) to almost 47 years during 2007–2012 (mean, 46.8;
95% CI, 46.0–47.6). The proportion of both non-Hispanic blacks
and Mexican Americans also increased during the observation
periods (by 9.8% and 71.7%, respectively), while the proportion of
college graduates increased from 19.9% in 1988–1994 to 26.8% in
2007–2012. Mean PIR decreased over time from 3.2 (95% CI,
2.9–3.4) in 1988–1994 to 3.0 (95% CI, 2.9–3.1) in 2007–2012. In
addition, mean BMI increased significantly during the study peri-
ods, from an average of 26.5 (95% CI, 26.3–26.7) in 1988–1994 to
28.2 (95% CI, 28.0–28.4) in 1999–2006 and 28.7 (95% CI,
28.5–28.9) in 2007–2012.
The overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome in 1988–1994 was
25.3%, declining to 25.0% in 1999–2006 and then increasing sub-
stantially to 34.2% in 2007–2012 (Table 2). Among men, the pre-
valence of metabolic syndrome increased from 25.6% during
1988–1994 to 33.4% during 2007–2012. Similarly, the prevalence
of metabolic syndrome increased for women from 25.0% during
the first period to 34.9% during the third period. During the entire
study period, the largest increase in the prevalence of metabolic
syndrome was observed among non-Hispanic black men (55%),
then non-Hispanic white women (44%), and non-Hispanic black
women (41%), while the smallest increase was observed among
Mexican American women (2%). Metabolic syndrome prevalence
increased among non-Hispanic white men by 31%, and increased
among Hispanic men by 12.5%. The prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome did not decline for any racial/ethnic group during the study
period (Figure 1), although among Mexican American men we
found a temporary decrease in prevalence of metabolic syndrome
between the first (24.7%; standard error [SE], 1.5) and second
(17.1%; SE, 1.1) period. When stratified by race/ethnicity and age
group, prevalence of metabolic syndrome increased from about
10% among those aged 18 to 29 years for all racial/ethnic groups
to almost 70% among women aged 70 or older in 2007–2012 (Fig-
ure 2). Appendices B, C, and D, show the prevalence of each
metabolic syndrome component stratified by race and sex. The
metabolic syndrome component with the most significant increase
during the study period was elevated waist circumference (among
men, from 23.6% in 1988–1994 to 42.6% in 2007–2012; among
women, from 38.2% to 60.9%), followed by low HDL cholesterol
(among men, from 29.6% in the first period to 41.7% in the third
period; among women, from 35.3% to 46.2%).

After adjusting for education, PIR, and age, we found that non-
Hispanic black men were less likely than non-Hispanic white men
to have metabolic syndrome during 1988–1994 (OR, 0.55; 95%
CI, 0.46–0.67), 1999–2006 (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53–0.76), and
2007–2012 (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66–0.89) (Table 2). Non-His-
panic black women were more likely than non-Hispanic white wo-
men to have metabolic syndrome only during the third period (OR,
1.20; 95% CI, 1.02–1.40). Compared with those with a college
education or higher, those with lower levels of education had sig-
nificantly increased odds of metabolic syndrome. In addition, for
every 10-year increase in age, odds of metabolic syndrome in-
creased by 50% (OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.46–1.54) in the first period
to 73% (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.67–1.80) in the third period.
Among nonobese participants overall, the prevalence of metabolic
syndrome appeared to remain stable during the study period (Ap-
pendices E and F; 1988–1994 prevalence, 16.0%; 1999–2006 pre-
valence, 16.8%; 2006–2012 prevalence, 16.1%). However, the
prevalence of metabolic syndrome among the nonobese increased
from 15.3% to 25.1% among non-Hispanic white women, from
14.5% to 20.9% among non-Hispanic black women, and from
9.6% to 16.9% among non-Hispanic black men.
Discussion
Our study is one of the largest (data are from almost 3 decades) to
use the harmonized criteria for metabolic syndrome in characteriz-
ing the prevalence, trends, and sociodemographic distribution of
this condition among US adults. We observed that by 2012, more
than one-third of all US adults met the criteria for metabolic syn-
drome, with the highest burden being among non-Hispanic black
and adults with low socioeconomic status. We observed that this
increase is not driven solely by the rising prevalence of obesity
among US adults; metabolic syndrome prevalence was constant
over time even among the nonobese (>16% prevalence for all peri-
ods). Prevalence of metabolic syndrome increases rapidly with
age, suggesting that given the demographic trend in the US popu-
lation of increasing age, further increases in metabolic syndrome
prevalence are to be expected, with concomitant increases in re-
lated chronic diseases and conditions.
Other studies had results that are in line with our findings, al-
though prevalence estimates vary depending on which metabolic
syndrome criteria are used. For instance, Beltrán-Sánchez et al ob-
served a prevalence of about 23% using the Adult Treatment Pan-
el criteria with NHANES data (21). Using the definitions by both
the IDF and the National Cholesterol Education Program, Ford et
al also observed similar trends of metabolic syndrome prevalence
in the United States, with 28% in 1988–1994 and 31.9% in 2000
(14,15). In a more recent study, Aguilar et al estimated the preval-
ence of metabolic syndrome from 2003 through 2012 to be 33%,
similar to our 34.2% during 2007–2012 (22). Out study also ex-
amined the independent association of education, income, and age
with prevalence of metabolic syndrome, and it focused on the sub-
group of nonobese adults. We found that regardless of the period,
low education and advanced age significantly increased the odds

 for metabolic syndrome. Given the recent consensus on the clinic-
al definition and categorical cut points for metabolic syndrome, it
will be important for research studies to focus next on identifying
etiologic factors to inform prevention strategies for this condition.
Our observation that metabolic syndrome prevalence increases
with age suggests that the efforts to increase awareness of preven-
tion strategies must begin early, ideally when any 1 of the con-
stituent components (eg, obesity) is present, before the develop-
ment of all 3 components required for the formal definition of
metabolic syndrome. The increased prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome among older adults seen by our study may be explained by
the increases in sedentary lifestyle and functional disability and
decreases in physical activity among older adults reported in other
studies (23–25). Additionally, our observation that low socioeco-
nomic status (measured by educational attainment and PIR) is
strongly associated with metabolic syndrome may also provide
clues to avenues for prevention. Public health strategies that are
well known to be important for chronic disease prevention in gen-
eral can substantially reduce the prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome. For instance, by improving access to fresh fruits and veget-
ables in low-income communities, which are often food deserts
and heavily targeted by purveyors of fat-dense and calorie-dense
but nutritionally poor foods; increasing availability of safe, walk-
friendly environments to encourage physical activity; and improv-
ing access to affordable health care (such as through the Afford-
able Care Act’s Medicaid expansion program) for timely manage-
ment of metabolic syndrome components (26). Population-specif-
ic studies will be important in identifying subgroups for which
metabolic syndrome is a health issue and for which disease man-
agement strategies are needed (for instance, non-Hispanic white
and non-Hispanic black women, among whom the prevalence is
about 35%). Simultaneously, studies to identify biomarkers associ-
ated with metabolic syndrome that are linked with the develop-
ment of specific chronic diseases, such as stroke or cancer, will
significantly enhance the early detection of these diseases. This ef-
fort will be critical for the 66 million US adults who meet the cri-
teria for metabolic syndrome and who are at risk for serious chron-
ic diseases and conditions as a result.
This study has several strengths and limitations. First, NHANES is
a nationally representative, standardized survey on a multitude of
health-related issues. This ensures that the results are generaliz-
able and have a high level of validity. Selection bias is minimized
because NHANES is a continuous survey of randomly selected in-
dividuals across the United States who respond to a standardized
survey administered by trained personnel. However, a study limit-
ation is the well-known racial/ethnic differences in the association
between obesity or BMI and health (27). Although the joint criter-
ia for metabolic syndrome indicates that population-specific cutoff
values for obesity be used, it remains unclear what the ideal BMI
cutoff is for non-Hispanic blacks or for Hispanics; more work in
this area would allow researchers to further refine estimates of the
prevalence of metabolic syndrome by race/ethnicity. Another lim-
itation is that we may have underestimated the overall prevalence
of metabolic syndrome (and its components) in the United State
population because of missing data on components from some in-
dividuals represented in NHANES. However, this limitation is un-
likely to result in systematic selection bias because we assume that
data are missing at random.
Metabolic syndrome prevalence increased since 1988 among US
adults, particularly among non-Hispanic white women, non-His-
panic black women, and individuals of low socioeconomic status.
As the US population ages, these rates are likely to continue to in-
crease, concurrent with age-related increases in other serious
chronic diseases such as stroke, cardiovascular diseases, and can-
cer. Work is needed to quantify the chronic disease burden associ-
ated with metabolic syndrome among US adults. Existing preven-
tions strategies, if implemented in population subgroups at highest
risk, may have a substantial effect on reducing these trends.
