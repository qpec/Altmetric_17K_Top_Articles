Summary
Background Local cancer relapse risk after breast conservation surgery followed by radiotherapy has fallen sharply in 
many countries, and is influenced by patient age and clinicopathological factors. We hypothesise that partial-breast 
radiotherapy restricted to the vicinity of the original tumour in women at lower than average risk of local relapse will 
improve the balance of beneficial versus adverse effects compared with whole-breast radiotherapy.
Methods IMPORT LOW is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done in 30 radiotherapy 
centres in the UK. Women aged 50 years or older who had undergone breast-conserving surgery for unifocal invasive 
ductal adenocarcinoma of grade 1–3, with a tumour size of 3 cm or less (pT1–2), none to three positive axillary nodes 
(pN0–1), and minimum microscopic margins of non-cancerous tissue of 2 mm or more, were recruited. Patients 
were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 40 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy (control), 36 Gy whole-breast radiotherapy 
and 40 Gy to the partial breast (reduced-dose group), or 40 Gy to the partial breast only (partial-breast group) in 
15 daily treatment fractions. Computer-generated random permuted blocks (mixed sizes of six and nine) were used 
to assign patients to groups, stratifying patients by radiotherapy treatment centre. Patients and clinicians were not 
masked to treatment allocation. Field-in-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy was delivered using standard 
tangential beams that were simply reduced in length for the partial-breast group. The primary endpoint was 
ipsilateral local relapse (80% power to exclude a 2·5% increase [non-inferiority margin] at 5 years for each 
experimental group; non-inferiority was shown if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the local relapse 
hazard ratio [HR] was less than 2·03), analysed by intention to treat. Safety analyses were done in all patients for 
whom data was available (ie, a modified intention-to-treat population). This study is registered in the ISRCTN 
registry, number ISRCTN12852634.
Findings Between May 3, 2007, and Oct 5, 2010, 2018 women were recruited. Two women withdrew consent for use of 
their data in the analysis. 674 patients were analysed in the whole-breast radiotherapy (control) group, 673 in the 
reduced-dose group, and 669 in the partial-breast group. Median follow-up was 72·2 months (IQR 61·7–83·2), and 
5-year estimates of local relapse cumulative incidence were 1·1% (95% CI 0·5–2·3) of patients in the control group, 
0·2% (0·02–1·2) in the reduced-dose group, and 0·5% (0·2–1·4) in the partial-breast group. Estimated 5-year absolute 
differences in local relapse compared with the control group were –0·73% (–0·99 to 0·22) for the reduced-dose and 
–0·38% (–0·84 to 0·90) for the partial-breast groups. Non-inferiority can be claimed for both reduced-dose and 
partial-breast radiotherapy, and was confirmed by the test against the critical HR being more than 2·03 (p=0·003 for 
the reduced-dose group and p=0·016 for the partial-breast group, compared with the whole-breast radiotherapy 
group). Photographic, patient, and clinical assessments recorded similar adverse effects after reduced-dose or partial-
breast radiotherapy, including two patient domains achieving statistically significantly lower adverse effects (change 
in breast appearance [p=0·007 for partial-breast] and breast harder or firmer [p=0·002 for reduced-dose and p<0·0001 
for partial-breast]) compared with whole-breast radiotherapy.
Interpretation We showed non-inferiority of partial-breast and reduced-dose radiotherapy compared with the standard 
whole-breast radiotherapy in terms of local relapse in a cohort of patients with early breast cancer, and equivalent or 
fewer late normal-tissue adverse effects were seen. This simple radiotherapy technique is implementable in 
radiotherapy centres worldwide.

Introduction
Breast radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery has 
been shown to reduce the risk of any recurrence of breast 
cancer by a half and breast cancer-related mortality by a 
sixth in patients with early breast cancer.1 Whole-breast 
radiotherapy is the standard of care in the UK and inter-
nationally.2–5 Current treatment guidelines discuss partial-
breast radiotherapy for selected patients at low risk of 
recurrence because of age, small tumour size, and early 
stage, the evidence for which comes mainly from retro-
spective and prospective cohort studies in patients who 
received treatment using the MammoSite system and 
long-term results of a single, small, well conducted 
randomised trial of interstitial brachytherapy.6–10
One challenge in treating patients with early breast 
cancer is to reduce the morbidity of radiotherapy without 
compromising its ability to cure the cancer. The rationale 
for investigating partial-breast radiotherapy is based on 
international reports of reductions in local relapse 
incidence, and the recognition that the majority of 
ipsilateral local relapses occur close to the region of the 
index tumour (the so-called tumour bed).11,12 Rapid 
technical advances in radiotherapy combined with 
accurate localisation of the tumour bed using titanium 
surgical clips enable more precise matching of radio-
therapy dose intensity to the spatial variation in local 
relapse risk. Precise matching  can now be achieved 
using a linear accelerator.13–15 This approach is predicted 
to have fewer chronic adverse effects than whole-breast 
radiotherapy, given the lower exposure of organs at risk, 
including breast tissue, ribcage, lung, and heart, without 
loss of local tumour control. Thousands of patients are 
currently being followed up in randomised studies, but 
long-term data (5 years or older) are available for few 
patients.7,16–18 We report 5-year results of the first phase 3 
trial testing partial-breast radiotherapy using a standard 
external beam technique and delivered after complete 
local tumour excision of low-risk early breast cancer.
Methods
Study design
IMPORT LOW is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, 
phase 3, non-inferiority trial comparing the safety and 
efficacy of standard whole-breast radiotherapy (control, 
whole-breast group) with experimental schedules of 
radiotherapy to the whole breast and partial breast 
(reduced-dose group), and to the partial breast only 
(partial-breast group). For the study protocol, see appendix 
pp 11–85. All treatment groups received simple forward-
planned intensity-modulated radiation techniques (IMRT) 
to optimise dose homogeneity. In addition to the main 
study, two substudies addressing late adverse effects 
were done in a subset of centres, including photographic 
assessments of the breast and comprehensive patient-
reported outcomes; centres declared upfront whether they 
wished to participate in the substudies. Patients were 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
A comprehensive literature search using PubMed and MEDLINE 
was done before the trial opened to identify all previous 
pathological and clinical breast radiotherapy studies 
investigating patterns of recurrence within the ipsilateral breast, 
and also to identify results of previous partial-breast 
radiotherapy studies. Search terms included “early breast cancer”, 
“partial irradiation”, and “partial breast radiotherapy”. 
Existing research suggests that most local relapses occur in the 
vicinity of the original tumour bed and that older trials testing 
partial-breast radiotherapy were uninformative because of 
suboptimal patient selection, poor localisation of the tumour, 
and hence, inaccurate radiotherapy. We hypothesised that 
partial-breast radiotherapy using modern methods of 
radiotherapy planning and treatment would be non-inferior in 
terms of local relapse incidence and might have reduced 
normal-tissue toxicity in a low-risk of relapse population. 
This formed part of our peer-reviewed funding application 
for the trial.
Added value of this study
IMPORT LOW is the first phase 3 trial reporting 5-year 
outcome data for local relapses and adverse effects after 
partial-breast radiotherapy delivered using standard external 
beam radiotherapy techniques, and is the only trial, to the best 
of our knowledge, testing the importance of treatment 
volume unconfounded by radiotherapy dose-time factors. 
Additionally, the study is unique because it includes very 
comprehensive patient-reported outcome measures.
At 5 years, partial-breast radiotherapy delivered using a simple 
and standard technique, showed no increase in local relapse 
rates compared with whole-breast radiotherapy, and produced 
equivalent or reduced late adverse effects. Follow-up is 
continuing and 10-year local relapse incidence and toxicity will 
be reported in future.
Implications of all the available evidence
IMPORT LOW has similar local relapse incidence to the 
recently reported GEC-ESTRO brachytherapy partial-breast 
radiotherapy trial that also confirmed non-inferiority of 
partial-breast versus whole-breast radiotherapy. Our method 
of partial-breast radiotherapy seems to be safe and effective 
and has a key advantage of being relatively simple compared 
with conformal or inverse-planned intensity-modulated 
radiotherapy or brachytherapy. The use of standard medial 
and lateral tangential beams also minimises the mean heart 
dose without the need for breath hold in most patients with 
left-sided breast cancer, given that most patients have 
tumours in the upper half of the breast and above the level of 
the heart. Implementation of this technique will not require 
additional resources or training in most countries worldwide.

recruited to the substudies from the participating centres 
until the planned sample size had been obtained, and 
separate consent was given for the main trial and 
substudies. The study was approved by the Oxfordshire 
Research Ethics Committee B (06/Q1605/128) and done 
in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical 
Practice.
Participants
Women who were aged 50 years or older who had breast-
conserving 
surgery 
for 
unifocal 
invasive 
ductal 
adenocarcinoma (excluding invasive carcinoma of classical 
lobular type) of any grade (1–3) were recruited. Other 
inclusion criteria were pathological tumour size 3 cm or 
less (pT1–2), axillary node negative or one to three positive 
nodes (pN0–1), and minimum microscopic margins of 
non-cancerous tissue of 2 mm or more. Patients were not 
eligible if they had distant metastases, a previous 
malignancy of any kind (unless non-melanomatous skin 
cancer), undergone a mastectomy, or received neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy or concurrent adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. 
Primary endocrine therapy was allowed as long as the 
tumour was less than 3·0 cm, all other inclusion criteria 
were met, and breast-conserving surgery had been done. 
Eligibility criteria were amended twice during the trial. 
Women with grade 3 tumours or tumours with a diameter 
greater than 2 cm, or both, were excluded before a protocol 
amendment (approved March 4, 2008). A subsequent 
amendment (approved May 7, 2009) allowed inclusion of 
lymphovascular invasion and patients with one to three 
positive nodes (pN1; original criteria were that patients 
were node negative). The reduced local relapse incidence 
in the START trial19 and other recent studies compared 
with older trials indicated that broadening of the eligibility 
criteria was safe.11 All patients provided written informed 
consent. The study was sponsored by The Institute of 
Cancer Research. The Institute of Cancer Research Clinical 
Trials and Statistics Unit (ICR-CTSU; London, UK) was 
responsible for study management and central statistical 
data monitoring and all analyses. The Trial Management 
Group was responsible for day-to-day running of the trial 
and was overseen by an independent trial steering com-
mittee (TSC) and interim data reviewed confidentially by 
an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). 
Patient advocates were involved at every stage of the trial, 
from initial study design through to preparation of the 
final manuscript.
Randomisation and masking
Women were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to receive 
conventional whole-breast radiotherapy or one of the 
two experimental schedules (reduced-dose or partial-breast 
radiotherapy). To randomly assign a patient, research staff 
at the centres telephoned ICR-CTSU to obtain the treat-
ment allocation and trial ID number. Computer-generated 
random permuted blocks (mixed sizes of six and nine) were 
used to assign patients to groups, stratifying patients by 
radiotherapy treatment centre. Treatment allocation was 
not masked from patients, clinicians, or those analysing 
the data.
Procedures
Patients assigned to whole-breast radiotherapy (control) 
received 40 Gy in 15 fractions to the whole breast, those 
assigned to the reduced-dose group received 36 Gy in 
15 fractions to the whole breast and 40 Gy in 15 fractions to 
the partial breast containing the tumour bed, and those 
assigned to the partial-breast group received 40 Gy in 
15 fractions to the partial breast only. For localisation of 
the tumour bed, it was strongly recommended by the Trial 
Management Group to insert surgical clips, but if this was 
not possible, ultrasound, MRI, or CT was used.13,20 If one 
of the recommended localisation procedures could not be 
done, entry into the study was permissible if the clinician 
was confident that clinical localisation was accurate—eg, 
if an obvious palpable tissue deficit was detected 
(appendix p 2).13,20 The protocol specified forward-planned 
field-in-field IMRT delivered by standard medial and 
lateral tangential beams reduced in length but not in 
width. Non-target breast tissue medial or lateral to the 
planning target volume was thereby included in the high-
dose zone (figure 1). Details of contouring and planning 
are described in the IMPORT LOW radiotherapy planning 
pack, which was used in addition to the clinical protocol 
(appendix p 1) and developed in partnership with the UK 
Radiotherapy Trials Quality Assurance (RTTQA) team. 
Each centre completed an initial questionnaire to establish 
details of their intended technique. Additionally, the 
RTTQA team visited each radiotherapy centre before 
opening of recruitment to independently validate the 
technique in use against the information given in 
the questionnaire. Measurements were made of the treat-
ment volume with a purpose-made breast phantom, with 
particular reference to dose homogeneity. All plans 
together with corresponding CT datasets were collected 
electronically and stored at the RTTQA repository. 
Additionally, a subset of approximately one in ten patients 
(every tenth patient enrolled) were selected at random-
isation to have thermo 
luminescence dosimetry measure-
ments, which were also sent to the RTTQA team.
After radiotherapy, patients were scheduled for annual 
follow-up for 10 years. The mammography schedule was 
followed according to local practice, and was typically done 
annually for the first 5 years and then every 3 years as 
part of the national screening programme. Normal-tissue 
effects were assessed by clinicians, patients, and using 
photographs. Clinicians assessed breast shrinkage, 
distortion, induration, breast oedema, and telangiectasia at 
1, 2, 5, and 10 years using a four-point scale (not at all, a 
little, quite a bit, or very much), comparing the ipsilateral 
breast with the contralateral breast when relevant.21 
The assessment after 1 year was only required after 
protocol amendment (approved March 4, 2008). For 
the photographic substudy, photographs were taken at

baseline (after surgery and before radiotherapy), at 2 years, 
and at 5 years.22 Patients in the patient-reported out-
comes substudy completed the European Organisation for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 
core questionnaire, EORTC QLQ-BR23 breast cancer 
module, body-image scale, protocol-specific questions 
(has skin appearance changed, overall breast appearance 
changed, breast become smaller, breast become harder or 
firmer to touch, or is shoulder stiffness present?), Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L 
health status questionnaire. These were scheduled at 
baseline (before randomisation), 6 months, and 1, 2, and 
5 years. Symptomatic rib fracture, symptomatic lung 
fibrosis, and ischaemic heart disease incidence were 
recorded at 1, 2, 5, and 10-year follow-up.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was local relapse, defined 
as the presence of any invasive or non-invasive carcinoma 
in any location in the ipsilateral breast parenchyma or 
overlying skin, assessed at each centre. Secondary efficacy 
outcomes were location of local tumour relapse, time to 
regional relapse (axilla, supraclavicular fossa, and internal 
mammary chain), time to distant relapse, disease-free 
survival (an event was defined as any local, regional, or 
distant relapse, contralateral breast cancer, or death due 
to breast cancer), overall survival, contralateral breast 
cancers, and other second primary cancers. Secondary 
outcomes relating to late-onset normal-tissue effects were 
assessed by clinicians for all patients, and also by patients 
and from photographs in the substudies.
Patient-reported outcomes focused on key items (arm 
or shoulder and breast) from the EORTC QLQ-BR23 
module and protocol-specific questions that were re-
corded on the same 4-point scale as for the clinician 
assessments (not at all, a little, quite a bit, or very much).
This manuscript reports on selected items from the BR23 
breast cancer module and protocol-specific questions that 
correspond to clinician-reported assessments. Further

analysis of patient-reported outcomes will be reported 
separately.
Digital photographs were scored as showing no 
change (none), mild, or marked change in breast 
appearance at 2 and 5 years compared with baseline by 
three observers (CC, AK, and JRY) using a previously 
described and validated consensus method.22 These 
observers were masked to treatment allocation but not 
to year of follow-up.
Statistical analysis
The trial was powered to assess non-inferiority of the 
cumulative incidence of local relapse for each of the 
experimental groups compared with the control group. A 
2·5% incidence of local relapse at 5 years was assumed 
with whole-breast radiotherapy, and the trial aimed to 
show that an increase of more than 2·5% in the 
cumulative incidence of local relapse would not occur in 
either experimental group. 645 patients were needed in 
each group to give 80% power with an α of 2·5% 
(one sided), allowing for 5% of patients to be lost to 
follow-up by 5 years. A target number of events was not 
stated in the protocol but data maturity was reviewed and 
discussed by the IDMC and TSC. The IDMC considered 
data to be sufficiently mature once at least 80% of forms 
were returned at 5 years.
The photographic substudy required 400 patients 
per group to have more than 90% power to detect at least 
a 10% difference in change of overall breast appearance 
for each experimental group compared with control 
(two-sided α of 0·025). With 400 patients per group, the 
patient-reported outcome substudy had more than 
80% power to detect differences of at least 15% in the 
prevalence of normal-tissue effects (two-sided α of 0·005 
to allow for multiple testing) and allowing for 10% attrition 
(due to death or illness). The same 0·005 threshold for 
significance was used for the clinician-reported normal-
tissue effects.
Survival analysis methods were used to compare efficacy 
outcomes between the control group and experimental 
schedules with time measured from randomisation. For 
time to local relapse, patients were censored at death or at 
final follow-up for those who had no events. For distant 
relapse, disease-free survival, and overall survival, patients 
who had no events were censored at final follow-up. 
Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard functions were plotted 
by treatment group.
Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to estimate event rates 
at 5 years with 95% CIs. Estimates of treatment effect 
were made using unadjusted Cox regression models, with 
hazard ratios (HRs) less than 1 indicating a decreased risk 
of the event in the experimental group compared with the 
control group. Absolute treatment differences in local 
relapses were calculated on the basis of the Kaplan-Meier 
estimate of patients who did not have local relapse in the 
control group and the HR. Each experimental group could 
be considered non-inferior to the control group if the 
upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for local relapse HR 
was less than 2·03 (critical HR; excluding an increase in 
local relapse from 2·5% to 5·0%). Superiority of each 
experimental group compared with the control could be 
tested if non-inferiority could be claimed (using a 0·025 
significance level). Analyses were done in the intention-to-
treat population. The primary outcome was also analysed

in the per-protocol population (all patients who completed 
their protocol-defined radiotherapy regimen) because this 
was a non-inferiority trial.
Patient and clinician-reported late normal tissue effects 
were dichotomised for the analysis as none or a little 
versus quite a bit or very much (defined as none or mild 
versus moderate or marked). The proportion of late 
moderate or marked events at 5 years is reported for each 
clinician-reported and patient-reported late normal-
tissue event. Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare 
each experimental schedule with the control group. All 
analyses of late normal tissue effects were done on a 
modified intention-to-treat basis—ie, all patients with 
available data, according to randomised treatment 
allocation. Time to first moderate or marked event was 
analysed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Patients with no 
events were censored at last assessment of normal 
tissues (by clinician or patient as appropriate) or death. 
For the patient-reported outcomes, the Cox model was 
adjusted for baseline scores. Photographic data is 
presented as the proportion of patients who had 
photographs taken, with no change (none) or mild or 
marked change in breast appearance at 2 and 5 years 
compared with baseline. The Fisher’s exact test was used 
to compare each experimental schedule with the control 
group at both time points. There was no imputation of 
missing normal-tissue data.
For all time-to-event analyses, the proportional hazards 
assumption of the Cox model was tested using Schoenfeld 
residuals and found to hold. Analyses were based on a 
database snapshot taken on June 15, 2016, and done using 
STATA version 13. This study is registered in the ISRCTN 
registry, number ISRCTN12852634, and ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT00814567

Role of the funding source
Cancer Research UK provided peer-reviewed approval for 
the trial but had no other role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the study data and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication. CLG and JMB also 
had full access to study data.
Results
Between May 3, 2007, and Oct 5, 2010, 2018 patients were 
recruited to the study. Two individuals withdrew consent 
for use of their data in the analysis; these two patients 
were removed from the intention-to-treat population. 
Patients were randomly assigned to either the whole-
breast group (n=675), reduced-dose group (n=674), or the 
partial-breast group (n=669). Five patients were found to 
be ineligible after randomisation (three patients had 
lobular breast carcinoma, one had renal cell carcinoma, 
and one had lung cancer). Three of these patients did not 
receive their allocation treatment, but the other two were 
in the control group and so received standard treatment 
regardless. 
Seven 
patients 
did 
not 
receive 
any 
radiotherapy and 54 did not receive their allocated 
treatment (figure 2). 1482 (74%) of 2016 patients had 
surgical clips, 494 (25%) had imaging (either CT or 
ultrasound), and for 40 (2%), clinical methods alone were 
used to localise the tumour bed. Demographic and 
clinical characteristics were similar across the three 
treatment groups (table 1). 104 (5%) of 2016 women had 
chemotherapy, 1826 (91%) had endocrine therapy, and 
36 (2%) had trastuzumab.
After 
a 
median 
follow-up 
of 
72·2 
months 
(IQR 61·7–83·2), local relapse had been reported for 
18 patients, nine (1%) of whom were in the whole-breast 
group, three (<1%) in the reduced-dose group, and six (1%) 
in the partial-breast group. 5-year estimated cumulative 
incidence of local relapse was 1·1% (95% CI 0·5–2·3) in 
the whole-breast group, 0·2% (0·02–1·2) in the reduced-
dose group, and 0·5% (0·2–1·4) in the partial-breast 
group. The estimated absolute differences in local relapse 
by 5 years in the experimental groups compared with 
whole-breast radio 
therapy at 5 years was –0·73% (95% CI 
–0·99 to 0·22) for the reduced-dose group and –0·38% 
(–0·84 to 0·90) for the partial-breast group. Since the 
upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI ruled out a 
greater than 2·5% increase in local relapse risk for each 
of the test schedules, non-inferiority can be claimed 
for both reduced-dose and partial-breast radiotherapy. 
Confirmation of this assertion is illustrated by a test

against the critical HR greater than 2·03, with p=0·003 
for the reduced-dose group and p=0·016 for the partial-
breast group compared with the whole-breast radiotherapy 
group (table 2; figure 3). Analyses in the per-protocol 
population were consistent (p=0·003 for the reduced-dose 
group and p=0·017 for the partial-breast group; full data 
for per-protocol analyses not shown because treatment 
compliance was high). Local relapses occurred most 
frequently in patients with at least one high-risk feature 
(appendix p 86).
Four regional relapses were reported: one in the whole-
breast group, one in the reduced-dose group, and two in 
the partial-breast group. Two of these relapses coincided 
with local relapse and two were isolated axillary relapses. 
Incidence of distant relapse, disease-free survival, and 
overall survival were similar across treatment groups, 
with low numbers of overall events and no statistically 
significant differences observed between experimental 
and control groups (table 2). 32 (2%) of 2016 patients 
developed invasive contralateral breast primary cancers: 
ten (1%) of 674 in the whole-breast group, 11 (2%) of 673 
in the reduced-dose group, and 11 (2%) of 669 in the 
partial-breast group (table 3). Non-breast second primary 
cancers were reported for 96 (5%) of 2016 patients: 
35 (5%) of 674 in the whole-breast group, 37 (5%) of 673 
in the reduced-dose group, and 24 (4%) of 669 in the 
partial-breast group. Colorectal, lung, and gynaecological 
cancers were the most common. 18 of the 19 cases of 
lung cancer developed within 5 years of randomisation 
and similar numbers were ipsilateral and contralateral to 
the treated breast (appendix p 87).
116 (6%) of 2016 patients died: 26 (1%) from breast 
cancer, 88 (4%) from other causes (including 42 [2%] 
from second cancers and nine [<1%] cardiac-related), and 
two (<1%) with unknown cause of death with no evidence 
of disease relapse before death (table 3). Numbers of 
cardiac deaths were similar between patients with left-
side and right-sided breast cancers (appendix p 88).
In relation to normal-tissue effects, at the 5-year assess-
ment, patients generally reported fewer moderate or 
marked events for the protocol-specific questions (skin 
change, overall breast appearance change, breast smaller, 
and breast harder or firmer to touch) in the partial-breast 
group than in the whole-breast group (table 4), although 
this reduction was statistically significant for change in 
breast appearance only (p<0·0001). At 5 years, change in 
breast appearance had the highest cumulative incidence 
of items reported as moderate or marked by patients in 
all groups. Reports of breast becoming harder or firmer 
were significantly reduced in both the reduced-dose 
group (p=0·002) and partial-breast group (p<0·0001) 
compared with the whole-breast group. Cumulative 
incidence of reports of the breast becoming harder or 
firmer were higher than the point prevalence at 5 years 
because this value included events reported earlier in 
follow-up, many of which were likely to be temporary 
post-surgical effects. The proportion of patients reporting 
any arm and shoulder symptoms as moderate or marked 
at 5 years was low in all groups with no significant 
differences for either experimental schedule compared 
with the control group. Similarly, cumulative incidence 
estimates indicated similar rates of arm and shoulder 
symptoms between groups.
1319 women consented to the photographic substudy, 
and baseline photographs were received and assessed 
for 1222 patients. Photographs taken at 2 years were 
assessed in 1000 women. The most common reasons 
for photographs not being available were centre 
administrative oversight so that photographic appoint-
ments were not made, patients not attending hospital 
visits, and patients withdrawing consent from the sub-
study. At 2 years, mild or marked changes in breast 
appearance were observed in 37 (11%) of 332 in the 
whole-breast group, 32 (10%) of 335 in the reduced-dose 
group, and 31 (10%) of 333 people in the partial-breast 
group. At 5 years, photographs were available for 
805 women and, compared with the 2-year results, the 
proportion of patients with mild or marked changes had 
increased across all groups (whole-breast 60 (23%) of 
262, reduced-dose 59 (22%) of 264, and partial-breast 
50 (18%) of 279). No evidence of a statistically significant 
difference was seen in the proportion of patients with a 
change in breast appearance for either experimental 
schedule compared with whole-breast radiotherapy at 
2 years (reduced-dose p=0·527; partial-breast p=0·446) 
or 5 years (reduced-dose p=0·917; partial-breast p=0·165).
Clinical assessment of late normal-tissue effects at 
5 years showed a low occurrence of moderate or marked 
events across all treatment groups (table 5). At 5 years, 
breast shrinkage had the highest prevalence of moderate 
or marked events (whole-breast 41 (9%) of 452, reduced-
dose 37 (8%) of 478, and partial-breast 33 (7%) of 472), 
whereas breast oedema was rare (whole-breast four (1%)

of 446; reduced-dose two (<1%) of 468; partial-breast 
none of 468). The cumulative incidences also indicated 
breast shrinkage to be the most common late normal-
tissue effect. The HRs for all late effects were consistently 
less than 1, but no evidence of statistically significant 
differences for individual events was seen. Severe late 
adverse effects were rare, and included four confirmed 
reports of rib fractures, eight of lung fibrosis, and five of 
ischaemic heart disease (appendix p 89).
Discussion
Our 5-year results confirm that local relapse was scarce 
across all trial groups and that non-inferiority was shown 
for both partial-breast and reduced-dose radiotherapy. 
Late normal-tissue effects were also uncommon across 
all groups, and significantly fewer patients reported 
breast hardness in the partial-breast radiotherapy group 
compared with control. These findings support our 
hypothesis that partial-breast radiotherapy using a 
standard radiation technique can reduce late toxicity 
without jeopardising local tumour control.
IMPORT LOW is the only phase 3 trial of partial-breast 
radiotherapy to use the same dose-fractionation regimen 
and radiation technique in the whole-breast and partial-
breast radiotherapy groups. Because the same regimen is 
used, differences in treatment outcome can be attributed 
more reliably to differences in radiotherapy volume. The 
Danish Breast Cancer Group phase 2 partial-breast 
radiotherapy trial is similarly designed to have breast 
volume as the only variable, but has a primary end-
point of grade 2 or higher breast induration at 3 years 
(Offersen B, Aarhus University, personal communication; 
NCT00892814). Other phase 3 partial-breast radiotherapy 
trials report a variety of different dose-fractionation 
regimens from a single intraoperative dose to 1–2 weeks of 
treatment.18,23,24 These differences make it challenging to 
distinguish whether variations in outcome are caused by 
differences in treated volume or radiation dose-time 
effects. This difficulty is illustrated by the interim results 
at 3 years from the RAPID trial25 (NCT00282035) that 
compared three-dimensional (3D) conformal partial-breast 
radiotherapy using 38·5 Gy in ten fractions over 5 days, 
with whole-breast radiotherapy using 42·5 Gy in 
16 fractions or 50 Gy in 25 fractions with an optional boost. 
Cosmetic outcome and late normal-tissue toxicity were 
worse in the partial-breast radiotherapy group in the 
RAPID trial, which suggests that dose-time effects were 
the dominant factor over reduced irradiated volume within 
this study. Other randomised trials (NSABP NCT00103181, 
SHARE NCT01247233, IRMA NCT01803958) using simi-
lar dose-fractionation regimens to RAPID have yet to 
publish mature outcome data, although early reports 
suggest minor toxicity.
Another strength of IMPORT LOW is that patients were 
specifically engaged with the aim of producing the most 
comprehensive 
patient-reported 
outcomes 
in 
any 
published partial-breast radiotherapy trial to date. The 
patient’s viewpoint is clearly important, but previous 
breast radiotherapy trials have shown that patient-reported 
outcomes are very sensitive when distinguishing between 
different dose-fractionation regimens.26 The results of 
IMPORT LOW suggest that patient-reported outcomes 
are also able to detect a radiotherapy volume effect, which 
is highly relevant for the design of future breast cancer 
radiotherapy trials, because patient-reported outcomes 
could be the most cost-effective yet sensitive and patient-
centred method of outcome assessment. We analysed and 
presented the late normal-tissue toxicity for both patient-
reported and clinician-reported outcomes both using 
discrete 5-year timepoints and cumulative incidence. The 
purpose of dual analysis is to convey different information, 
in that the longitudinal results capture the maximum 
grades of toxicity, whereas the cross-sectional 5-year

results take into account that some side-effects were 
resolved, such as oedema, which might reduce over time. 
We acknowledge that multiple statistical tests were done 
for the normal-tissue toxicity analysis, but we accounted 
for this by using a stringent significance level of 0·005 for 
clinician-reported and patient-reported outcomes.
The simplicity of IMPORT LOW is also a strength. The 
partial-breast radiotherapy technique uses standard 
tangential fields that are simply shortened to encompass 
the tumour bed and margin of healthy tissue. This 
technique means that a larger volume of breast is treated 
than with other 3D conformal or IMRT and brachytherapy 
techniques, but tangential beams minimise dose to 
surrounding organs at risk such as the heart and lungs 
by keeping the exit beams within the breast. This method 
might be important in minimising second radiation-
induced cancers. It might also minimise the mean heart 
dose without the need for breath-hold in most patients 
with left-sided breast cancer, given that most patients 
have tumours in the upper half of the breast and above 
the level of the heart.27,28 The tangential field arrangement 
is more likely to deliver at least some dose to the lower 
axilla in comparison with more conformal partial-breast 
radiotherapy techniques that are likely to deliver none, 
which might be important in minimising axillary 
recurrences.29 A simple form of forward-planned IMRT 
was used to optimise dose homogeneity, but this is now 
standard in most centres,30,31 so implementation of this

technique does not require additional resources or 
training in most countries.
The original estimates of local relapse on which the 
sample size was based were high, given recent general 
improvements in local tumour control.11 Retrospective 
power calculations, based on year 5 data being available 
for 1832 (91%) of 2016 patients and an observed local 
relapse 5-year cumulative incidence in the control group 
of 1·1% confirm that a clinically relevant absolute 
2·0% increase in 5-year local relapse could be excluded for 
each test group, assuming 80% power and 2·5% α (one-
sided). The demonstration of non-inferiority is expected to 
be stable with longer follow-up, although proportion of 
patients with local relapse in IMPORT LOW is likely to be 
in the range of 1–3% by 10 years. This expectation is based 
on the ELIOT trial23 in which the cumulative incidence of 
local relapse in the intraoperative group rose in an 
apparently linear fashion between 5 and 9 years. 
Compliance with photographic assessments was not as 
high as anticipated in IMPORT LOW. However, given the 
few reported changes in breast appearance at 5 years in 
the control group (23%), retrospective power calculations 
indicate that this photographic substudy has 75% power to 
detect a difference of 10% (with a 2·5% significance level).
Furthermore, our study might have been limited by 
biased reporting of late normal-tissue toxicity because 
treatment allocation could not be masked. However, the 
panel of assessors doing the photographic assessments 
were masked to treatment groups, although photographic 
assessments seem to be less sensitive to subtle changes in 
normal-tissue toxicity than patient-reported assess 
ments.
A major question raised by this trial is which patients 
should be selected for partial-breast radiotherapy? 
IMPORT LOW was originally designed to recruit patients 
with very low-risk disease; however, eligibility criteria were 
widened during recruitment to include some slightly 
higher-risk features after the publication of evidence of 
low recurrence rates from other breast radiotherapy trials, 
such as START.19 However, looking at the baseline 
characteristics in IMPORT LOW, most of the women who 
were recruited had small, low-grade, ER-positive, node-
negative tumours. The appendix (p 86) shows that despite 
the low proportion of patients with high-risk disease, 
these patients had eight of the 18 local relapses. However, 
this observation should be taken with caution because the 
overall number of events was low. The UK has taken a 
pragmatic approach to patient selection for partial-breast 
radiotherapy by producing a consensus statement,32 which 
states that partial-breast radiotherapy can be considered 
for patients who are 50 years or older, with grade 1–2 
cancer, a tumour of 30 mm or less, ER positive, HER2 
negative, and N0 with minimum 1 mm radial excision 
margins for invasive disease. Given the small proportion 
of participants in IMPORT LOW who were node positive, 
we support the UK Breast Radiotherapy Consensus in not 
recommending partial-breast radiotherapy for this group. 
Consistent with the findings of ACOSOG Z0011,33 IBSCG 
23–01,34 NCIC MA20,35 and EORTC 22922,36 we 
recommend that patients who are node positive receive 
whole-breast radiotherapy as standard of care.
A further controversy raised by this and other reported 
studies,37 is the definition of ipsilateral local relapse. For

example, the IMPORT LOW definition is recurrence of 
any preinvasive or invasive carcinoma in the ipsilateral 
breast regardless of histology or location of the index 
breast cancer. The GEC-ESTRO trial8 definition does not 
take into account location within the breast, but does 
exclude tumours with differing histology, and the 
Cochrane review37 only includes relapses within the index 
quadrant with the same histology. Clearly, inclusion or 
exclusion of local relapses could make a substantial 
difference in reported results given the low number of 
events in this patient group.
Finally, the results of IMPORT LOW are not consistent 
with the 2016 overview by the Cochrane Collaboration37 
that was based on the published data of phase 3 trials, six 
of which contributed to analyses of local relapses and 
four to analyses of toxicity endpoints. This overview 
reported inferior results for both local relapse and late 
normal-tissue toxicity with partial-breast radiotherapy. 
The small number of contemporary partial-breast radio-
therapy trials described in the Cochrane report37 might 
explain the difference between the findings.31 Four other 
phase 2 trials testing partial-breast radiotherapy are yet 
to report 5-year results (NSABP/RTOG NCT00103181, 
RAPID NCT00282035, SHARE NCT01247233, and 
IRMA NCT01803958). The mature results from over 
10 000 patients recruited within these important trials 
will add to the literature in future.
The results from as yet unpublished partial-breast 
radiotherapy trials are clearly needed, but because of 
the huge heterogeneity in dose-fractionation regimen, 
radiotherapy technique, irradiated volume, and incon-
sistencies in the definition of ipsilateral breast tumour 
recurrence, these data might prove challenging to 
interpret. A large individual patient data meta-analysis 
might resolve this potential dilemma and we strongly 
support this initiative.
We also recognise the importance of investigating 
possible effects of partial-breast radiotherapy on the 
development of radiation-induced second cancer and 
major cardiac events. However, this research will require

thousands of patients followed up for many years before 
robust conclusions can be made and might be best 
achieved by future interrogation of routine health data.
Another approach is to investigate the biology of local 
relapse and its relationship to partial-breast radiotherapy. 
For example, what constitutes a true ipsilateral recurrence 
from an ipsilateral new primary at the molecular level is 
still unclear and requires further investigation.
At 5 years, partial-breast radiotherapy delivered using a 
simple intensity-modulated technique achieved non-
inferiority in incidence of local relapse compared with 
whole-breast radiotherapy and similar or reduced late 
adverse effects. This method of partial-breast radiotherapy 
seems to be safe and effective and could be implemented 
easily within most radiotherapy centres worldwide.
