 Most patients with depressive symptoms do not reach the
minimum diagnostic criteria for major depression, and are
described as having minor or subsyndromal or subthreshold
depression.1 For subthreshold depression, different definitions
based on the number of depressive symptoms, duration of
symptoms,
exclusion
criteria
and
associated
functional
impairment have been proposed.2 Judd and colleagues defined
the category subsyndromal symptomatic depression as ‘any two
or more simultaneous symptoms of depression, present for most
or all of the time, at least two weeks in duration, associated with
evidence of social dysfunction, occurring in individuals who do
not meet criteria for diagnoses of major depression and/or
dysthymia’.3,4
The public health importance of minor depression has been
highlighted,
with
reported
rates
varying
according
to
the
definition used: 2.5–9.9% in community samples or 5–16% in
primary care patients.3,5,6 Minor depression is associated with
psychological
suffering,
significant
decrements
in
health,
significant impairment in daily living activities and with a
considerable impact on quality of life.7–10 Minor depression is
also a strong risk factor for major depression, which develops in
10–25% of patients with subthreshold depression within 1–3
years.11 Additionally, minor depression might increase the risk
of death in older individuals.12
Under
ordinary
circumstances,
patients
with
depressive
symptoms, but not major depression or dysthymia, have been
frequently treated with antidepressants and benzodiazepines.13–18
In the province of Alberta, Canada, for example, more than 67%
of a community sample of individuals receiving antidepressants
did not have any psychiatric diagnosis, but reported, as the main
reasons for taking these medicines, depressive symptoms, stress,
sleep problems, anxiety or headache.13 In Europe, a cross-sectional
population-based study conducted in Belgium, France, Germany,
Italy, The Netherlands and Spain found that nearly 10% of
individuals without any episode of major depression currently
used either or both antidepressants and benzodiazepines. In this
study, seeking help for emotional problems appeared to be a
more important predictor for the use of antidepressants or
benzodiazepines than a formal diagnosis of major depression.14
The use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines in minor
depression has been explored by narrative reviews that concluded
that antidepressants may have a small to moderate benefit in
patients with this condition,19,20 and that benzodiazepines seem
to have some effect on anxiety rather than depressive symptoms.21
The literature searches of these reviews, however, were last
updated in 2001, and therefore did not include studies published
thereafter. In the present systematic review we sought to
determine the efficacy and acceptability of pharmacological
treatments for patients with minor depression.

Background
Depression is a common condition that has been frequently
treated with psychotropics.
Aims
To review systematically the evidence of efficacy and
acceptability of antidepressant and benzodiazepine
treatments for patients with minor depression.
Method
A systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind
randomised controlled trials comparing antidepressants or
benzodiazepines v. placebo in adults with minor depression.
Data were obtained from MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE,
PsycInfo, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and
pharmaceutical company websites. Risk of bias was
assessed for the generation of the allocation sequence,
allocation concealment, masking, incomplete outcome data,
and sponsorship bias.
Results
Six studies met inclusion criteria. Three studies compared
paroxetine with placebo; fluoxetine, amitriptyline and
isocarboxazid were studied in one study each. No studies
compared benzodiazepines with placebo. In terms of failures
to respond to treatment (6 studies, 234 patients treated with
antidepressants and 234 with placebo) no significant
difference between antidepressants and placebo was found
(relative risk (RR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.81–1.08). In terms of
acceptability, data extracted from two studies (93 patients
treated with antidepressants and 93 with placebo) showed
no statistically significant difference between antidepressants
and placebo (RR = 1.06, 95% CI 0.65–1.73). There was no
statistically significant between-study heterogeneity for any of
the reported analyses.
Conclusions
There is evidence showing there is unlikely to be a clinically
important advantage for antidepressants over placebo in
individuals with minor depression. For benzodiazepines, no
evidence is available, and thus it is not possible to determine
their potential therapeutic role in this condition.

Review article
 benzodiazepines v. placebo. Quasi-randomised trials, such as
those allocating by using alternate days of the week, were
excluded. For trials with a crossover design, only results from
the first randomisation period were considered.
Participants
We included patients aged 18 or older, male and female, meeting
criteria for minor/subthreshold depression according to the DSM,
ICD, Research Diagnostic Criteria or any other standardised
criteria. Studies that did not exclude the presence of major
depression at study entry were not considered. We included
studies in which individuals with major and minor depression
were recruited, or studies in which individuals with dysthymia
and minor depression were recruited,
if the results were
specifically reported for those with minor depression. Studies
including individuals with minor depression and a serious
concomitant medical illness were not considered. No language
restrictions were applied.
Interventions
Active pharmacological treatments under study included the
following.
(a) Antidepressants:
tricyclic/heterocyclic,
selective
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitors
(fluoxetine,
fluvoxamine,
citalopram,
paroxetine, escitalopram, sertraline), selective noradrenaline
reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipran,
desvenlafaxine), monoamine oxidase inhibitors or newer
agents
(mirtazapine,
bupropion,
reboxetine,
nefazodone,
trazodone).
(b) Benzodiazepines: anxiolytic agents, hypnotics and sedatives.
Outcome measures
Outcome measures were the following.
.
Group mean scores at the end of the trial, or group mean
change from baseline to end-point, on the Hamilton Rating
Scale for Depression (HRSD),22 Montgomery–A
˚ sberg Depres-
sion Scale (MADRS)23 or Clinical Global Impression (CGI)24
rating scale. When trials reported results from more than one
rating scale, we used the HRSD results or, if not available, the
MADRS results.
.
Failure to respond to treatment: proportion of patients who
failed to show a reduction of at least 50% on the HRSD or
MADRS, or who did not score ‘much improved’ or ‘very
much improved’ on the CGI, or proportion of patients who
failed to respond using any other pre-specified criterion.
.
Proportion of patients still with major depressive disorder at
study end-point, as established with help of a standardised
diagnostic interview.
.
Proportion of patients leaving the study early for any reason –
total drop-out rate.
Search methods for identification of studies
Literatures searches (last update: May 2009) were performed in
the following databases and article indexes: MEDLINE, CINAHL,
EMBASE, PsycInfo and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register.
Controlled vocabulary was utilised where appropriate terms were
available, supplemented with keyword searches to ensure accurate
and exhaustive results. Search results were limited to randomised
controlled trials or clinical trials (Phase III). Language or
publication year limits were not applied to any search (online
Appendix DS1).
To supplement the searches of published research, the internet
was also utilised to locate additional clinical trials, unpublished
research and/or grey literature. Websites of pharmaceutical
companies, clinical trials, and medical control agencies were
searched with a specific focus on clinical trial registries. Searched
websites included: ClinicalTrials.gov, Eli Lilly, Lundbeck, Organon,
Solvay, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pierre
Fabre, Wyeth, US Food and Drug Administration, European
Medicines Agency, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency
(Japan), and Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia).
Data collection and analysis
Selection of trials
Included and excluded studies were collected following the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA; online Appendix DS2).25 We examined all
titles and abstracts, and obtained full texts of potentially relevant
papers. Working independently and in duplicate, two reviewers
read the papers and determined whether they met inclusion
criteria. Considerable care was taken to exclude duplicate
publications.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used (Cochrane Collaboration,
Oxford, England). This instrument consists of six items. Two
items assess the strength of the randomisation process in
preventing selection bias in the assignment of participants to
interventions: adequacy of sequence generation and allocation
concealment. The third item (masking) assesses the influence of
performance bias on the study results. The fourth item assesses
the likelihood of incomplete outcome data, which raises the
possibility of bias in effect estimates. The fifth item assesses
selective
reporting,
the
tendency
to
preferentially
report
statistically significant outcomes. This item requires a comparison
of published data with trial protocols, when such are available.
The final item refers to other sources of bias that are relevant in
certain circumstances such as sponsorship bias.
Data extraction
Two reviewers (C.B. and A.C.) independently extracted data
concerning participant characteristics, intervention details and
outcome measures. Disagreements were resolved by discussion
and consensus with a third member of the team.
For continuous outcomes, the mean change from baseline to
end-point, the mean scores at end-point, the standard deviation
or standard error of these values, and the number of patients
included in these analyses were extracted.26 Data were extracted
preferring the 17-item HRSD (over any other version of the
HRSD) and over the MADRS and the CGI.
For dichotomous outcomes, the number of patients under-
going the randomisation procedure, the number of patients rated
as responders and the number of patients leaving the study early
were recorded.
Data analysis
A double-entry procedure was employed. Data were initially
entered
and
analysed
using
the
Cochrane
Collaboration’s
Review Manager software version 5 for Windows (Cochrane
Collaboration, Oxford, England), and subsequently entered into
a spreadsheet and re-analysed using the ‘metan’ command of
12
Barbui et al
 Antidepressants and benzodiazepines in minor depression
STATA 9.0 for Windows (STATA Corporation, College Station,
Texas, USA). Outputs were cross-checked for internal consistency.
Continuous data were analysed using mean differences or
standardised mean differences (when scores from different
outcome scales were summarised) using the random effects model
(with 95% confidence intervals, CI), as this takes into account any
differences between studies even if there is no statistically
significant heterogeneity.27
Failure to respond to treatment was calculated on an
intention-to-treat basis: individuals who dropped out were always
included in this analysis. When data on these participants were
carried forward and included in the efficacy evaluation (last
observation carried forward), they were analysed according to
the
primary
studies;
when
they
were excluded
from any
assessment in the primary studies, they were considered as drug
failures. For dichotomous outcomes, the relative risk (RR) was
calculated based on the random effects model (with 95% CI).
When outcome data were not reported, trial authors were
asked to supply the data. For continuous outcomes, when only
the standard error was reported, it was converted into standard
deviation according to Altman.28 When standard deviation and
errors were not reported at end-point, the mean value of known
standard deviations was calculated from the group of included
studies according to Furukawa et al.29 For dichotomous outcomes,
in case of no response from study authors, we estimated the
number of patients responding to treatment using a validated
imputation method.30,31
Visual inspection of graphs was used to investigate the
possibility of statistical heterogeneity. This was supplemented
using I2. This provides an estimate of the percentage of variability
due to heterogeneity rather than chance alone. Where the I2
estimate is greater than or equal to 50%, we interpreted this as
indicating the presence of high levels of heterogeneity.32
Findings were summarised in a table according to the
methodology described by the GRADE working group.33,34
Results
Characteristics of included studies
The original searches yielded 719 papers potentially relevant for
this review (Fig. 1). Of these, 686 were excluded because neither
titles nor abstracts indicated that patients with minor depression
were captured. The remaining 33 studies were retrieved for more
detailed evaluation, and 6 met the review inclusion criteria35–45
(online Appendix 3 lists the 27 excluded studies). The main
characteristics of the six studies are reported in online Table
DS1. Three studies compared paroxetine with placebo, while
fluoxetine, amitriptyline and isocarboxazid were studied in one
study each. No studies were found comparing benzodiazepines
with placebo. Only one study recruited more than 100 patients,
and length of follow-up ranged between 6 and 12 weeks. Two
studies were carried out in individuals aged 60 or older, and three
studies recruited patients in primary healthcare settings. All six
studies excluded patients with major depression. Three studies
were not financially supported by pharmaceutical companies.
The overall quality of included studies was graded as low (Fig. 2
and online Appendix 4). In particular, incomplete outcome data
were not addressed in most studies.
Efficacy and acceptability of antidepressants
versus placebo
In terms of depressive symptoms, data extracted from three
studies (106 patients treated with antidepressants and 108 with
placebo) showed no statistically significant difference between
antidepressants and placebo (mean difference 70.93, 95% CI
72.27 to 0.41) (Fig. 3). There was no statistically significant
between-study heterogeneity.
In terms of failures to respond to treatment, data extracted
from four studies (137 patients treated with antidepressants and
137 with placebo) showed no statistically significant difference

 Antidepressants and benzodiazepines in minor depression
No data were available in terms of proportion of patients with
major depressive disorder at follow-up, as established with help of
a standardised diagnostic interview. In terms of proportion of
patients leaving the study early, data extracted from two studies
(93 patients treated with antidepressants and 93 with placebo)
showed no statistically significant difference between antidepressants
and placebo (RR= 1.06, 95% CI 0.65–1.73) (online Appendix DS4).
There was no statistically significant between-study heterogeneity.
Discussion
The present systematic review found evidence suggesting that
there is unlikely to be a clinically important difference between
antidepressants and placebo in patients with minor depression.
Although only six studies and fewer than 500 patients were
included, we note that confidence intervals of treatment estimates
were not very wide. For continuous scores, no research evidence
or consensus is available about what constitutes a clinically
meaningful difference in HRSD scores;46 however, the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence required a difference
of at least three points as the criterion for clinical importance.47
Although we recognise that this criterion is rather arbitrary, the
lower confidence interval calculated in the present review, a mean
difference of –2.27 points in HRSD scores, does not cross this
threshold. Similarly, for dichotomous outcomes the GRADE
working group suggested a relative risk reduction of 25% as the
threshold for clinical significance, and in our analysis the lower
confidence interval of the relative risk reduction was 19%. We
therefore conclude that there is evidence showing that there is
unlikely to be a clinically important advantage for antidepressants
in individuals with minor depression.
The
clinically
relevant
depressive
symptoms
in
minor
depression may be considered on a continuum between no
symptoms at one end and severe major depression at the other.48
This conceptualisation would imply that there are no qualitative
differences between major depression and minor depression, but
this has been questioned.49 Our results may reinforce the concept
of a continuum as in individuals with major depression re-analysis
of clinical trial data showed that the drug–placebo difference
increases as a function of initial severity, rising from virtually no
difference in mild depression to a relatively small difference for
adults with moderate depression and a medium difference in
severe depression.50,51
Limitations
The limitations of the present analysis are those of the included
primary studies. Three trials included fewer than 50 patients,
and all six studies had short-term follow-up. Incomplete data
reporting was a major issue: the proportion of patients who
developed major depression at follow-up was never reported,
mean values at study end-point were reported without the
standard deviations in two studies, and two studies did not report
the proportion of improved patients. Even more important, of the
four studies that included patients with minor depression and
major depression or dysthymia (online Table DS1), only in two
was the randomisation stratified by diagnostic subtype.
Clinical implications
Despite these limitations, clinical and policy implications may be
drawn. There is now a clear indication that psychological
treatments for minor depression have a significant effect on
depressive symptoms, at least in the short-term.52 This indication,
together with the results of the present systematic review, may
suggest that antidepressants should not be considered for the
initial treatment of individuals with minor depression. For
benzodiazepines, although previous reports yielded contrasting
results,21,53 no studies were included in our review and so it is
not possible to determine their potential therapeutic role in minor
depression. We note that in clinical practice benzodiazepines are
frequently prescribed for the treatment of patients with depressive
symptoms;54 however, the risk of drug misuse, dependence and
withdrawal symptoms might outweigh any potential benefits
related to their rapid anxiolytic effect.
Considering
the
extensive
use
of
drugs
for emotional
complaints in absence of a diagnosis of major depression,14
shifting from drugs to psychological interventions would require
investment in human resources, training and supervision, as well
as additional time for healthcare providers to deliver the inter-
ventions. In systems with no or low resources doctors should still
shift away from drug intervention as resources may be better spent
elsewhere in the health system. There is clearly a need to develop
alternative approaches to extend and scale up care to persons with
this condition.55
