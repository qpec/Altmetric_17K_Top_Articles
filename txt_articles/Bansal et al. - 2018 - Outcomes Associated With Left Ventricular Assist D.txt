IMPORTANCE Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are widely used both as a bridge to heart
transplant and as destination therapy in advanced heart failure. Although heart failure is
common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), little is known about outcomes
after LVAD implantation in this population.
OBJECTIVE To determine the utilization of and outcomes associated with LVADs in nationally
representative cohorts of patients with and without ESRD.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We described LVAD utilization and outcomes among
Medicare beneficiaries after ESRD onset (defined as having received maintenance dialysis or
a kidney transplant) from 2003 to 2013 based on Medicare claims linked to data from the
United States Renal Data System (USRDS), a national registry for ESRD. We compared
Medicare beneficiaries with ESRD to a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries without ESRD.
EXPOSURES ESRD (vs no ESRD) among patients who underwent LVAD placement.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was survival after LVAD placement.
RESULTS Among the patients with ESRD, the mean age was 58.4 (12.1) years and 62.0% (96)
were male. Among those without ESRD, the mean age was 62.2 (12.6) years and 75.1% (196)
were male. From 2003 to 2013, 155 Medicare beneficiaries with ESRD (median and
interquartile range [IQR] days from ESRD onset to LVAD placement were 1655 days
[453-3050 days]) and 261 beneficiaries without ESRD in the Medicare 5% sample received an
LVAD. During a median follow-up of 762 days (IQR, 92-3850 days), 127 patients (81.9%) with
and 95 (36.4%) without ESRD died. more than half of patients with ESRD (80 [51.6%])
compared with 11 (4%) of those without ESRD died during the index hospitalization. The
median time to death was 16 days (IQR 2-447 days) for patients with ESRD compared with
2125 days (IQR, 565-3850 days) for those without ESRD. With adjustment for demographics,
comorbidity and time period, patients with ESRD had a markedly increased adjusted risk of
death (hazard ratio, 36.3; 95% CI, 15.6-84.5), especially in the first 60 days after LVAD
placement.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with ESRD at the time of LVAD placement had an
extremely poor prognosis, with most surviving for less than 3 weeks. This information may be
crucial in supporting shared decision-making around treatments for advanced heart failure
for patients with ESRD.

eft ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are used as both a
bridge to heart transplant and destination therapy for
patients with advanced heart failure.1 and have been
shown to prolong survival and improve quality of life.1-3 The
RandomizedEvaluationofMechanicalAssistancefortheTreat-
ment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) trial demon-
strated that LVAD placement as destination therapy im-
proved survival compared with medical therapy alone.1 In
2008—fueled by advances in LVAD technology, scarcity of do-
nor hearts,1 and a growing number of patients who are ineli-
gible heart transplantation due to comorbidity4—the US Food
and Drug Administration approved the use of LVADs as desti-
nation therapy for advanced heart failure, paving the way for
expansion in the use of these devices.5-7
The prevalence of heart failure is approximately 40%
among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and 37%
die from heart failure.8 Few studies have evaluated out-
comes among LVAD recipients with kidney disease, and these
have largely focused on patients with earlier stages of kidney
disease not receiving dialysis and those receiving acute dialy-
sis for acute kidney injury, rather than those with ESRD.9,10 To
address this knowledge gap, we designed a study to compare
national trends in utilization and outcomes after LVAD place-
ment among patients with vs without ESRD, defined as hav-
ingreceivedmaintenancedialysisorakidneytransplant,atthe
time of LVAD placement.
Methods
Data Sources
We used the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), a na-
tional registry for ESRD, linked to Medicare claims to define a
cohortofbeneficiarieswithESRDwhoreceivedtheirfirstLVAD
between 2003 and 2013. We defined ESRD as having received
maintenance dialysis or a kidney transplant for treatment of
chronic kidney disease. In the USRDS, a person is identified
as having ESRD when a physician certifies the disease on the
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’(CMS) Medical
Evidence form, or when there is other evidence that the pa-
tient has received maintenance dialysis or a kidney trans-
plant. At the time of our study, patients receiving mainte-
nance dialysis for the treatment of acute kidney injury did not
appear in the USRDS registry. For comparison, we used the 5%
Medicare sample linked to the USRDS registry to identify a na-
tionally representative cohort of Medicare beneficiaries who

tained from the University of Washington.
Exposure Variable
Our primary exposure was LVAD placement based on an In-
ternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9),
code (37.66, 37.62, and 37.65) search of Medicare claims to as-
certain the date of each patient’
s first LVAD placement.5 There
were 467 patients with ESRD in the USRDS registry that had
at least 1 LVAD placed between 2003 and 2013 (Figure 1A). Of
these, we excluded patients who recovered kidney function
prior to LVAD placement, did not have Medicare Parts A and
B,orwerecoveredbyahealthmaintenanceorganization(HMO)
during the year before LVAD placement. Because the focus of
Key Points
Question Do outcomes after placement of a left ventricular assist
device (LVAD) for the treatment of advanced heart failure in
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) differ compared with
those of patients without ESRD?
Findings In this 11-year study of a nationally representative
patient population of LVAD recipients, 81.9% of patients with
ESRD prior to LVAD implantation died during follow-up (vs 36.4%
among patients without ESRD) and the median time to death was
16 days after LVAD placement for patients with ESRD (vs 2125 days
for those without ESRD).
Meaning Left ventricular assist device recipients with preexisting
ESRD have an extremely poor prognosis.

 our study was on patients with ESRD at the time of LVAD place-
ment, we excluded those for whom LVAD placement had pre-
ceded ESRD onset, yielding an analytic cohort of 155 LVAD re-
cipients with ESRD at the time of LVAD placement.
Among members of the 5% Medicare sample, we identi-
fied504patientswhoreceivedanLVADbetween2003and2013
(Figure 1B). We excluded patients with ESRD at the time of
LVAD placement and those who did not have Medicare Parts
A and B or had HMO coverage during the year before LVAD
placement, yielding an analytic cohort of 261 LVAD recipients
without ESRD at the time of LVAD placement.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was death after LVAD placement. Date
of death was ascertained from the USRDS Standard Analysis
Files for patients with ESRD and from the Medicare Denomi-
nator File for those without ESRD. Additional outcomes in-
cluded death during the index hospitalization and receipt of
a heart transplant during follow-up (ICD-9 procedure codes
37.5, 37.51, and 33.6). All patients were followed until death or
the end of follow-up (December 31, 2013). Outcomes at dis-
crete time periods after LVAD placement are reported for the
subset of patients who died on or before December 31, 2012,
to allow for at least 1 year of follow-up for all patients.
Covariates

ure,dementia,diabetes,dyslipidemia,chronicobstructivepul-
monary disease, hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and

score, a comprehensive index of comorbidity based on ICD-9
codes.11 Time period of LVAD placement was categorized as fol-
lowstoaccountforadvancesinLVADtechnologyovertime:2003
to2006,2007to2009,and2010to2013.ForpatientswithESRD,
we included information on modality of renal replacement

plant)atthetimeofLVADplacement.Medicareclaimswereused

bation,tracheostomy,placementofanimplantablecardioverter
defibrillator, placement of a cardiac pacemaker, days in the in-
tensive care unit (ICU) or coronary care unit, length of stay, and
Medicare Parts A and B costs.
Statistical Methods
We examined temporal trends in LVAD placement among pa-
tients with and without ESRD using denominator popula-
tions of ESRD and non-ESRD Medicare beneficiaries during
each time period from the USRDS registry and 5% Medicare
sample, respectively. We described patterns of care and out-
comes during the index hospitalization using mean (SD) or
median (interquartile range [IQR]) values for continuous
variables and percentages for categorical variables.
We generated Kaplan-Meier curves to compare survival
probability among patients with and without ESRD. We exam-
ined the percentage of surviving patients who had received a
heart transplant at discrete time points after LVAD placement
(at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months).
We used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the
association of ESRD (vs no ESRD) with time to death after LVAD
placement, adjusting for demographics, comorbid condi-
tions during the year before cohort entry, tertile of Quan score,
and time period of LVAD placement. Follow-up time was de-
fined as time from of the date of LVAD placement to death or
theendoffollow-up(December31,2013),whichevercamefirst.
We included an interaction term for time (>60 days; P < .001)
in final Cox models to accommodate a violation in the propor-
tional hazards assumption identified by examining Kaplan-
Meier curves and Schoenfeld residuals.
We also tested for an interaction with time period (2003-
2008 and 2009-2013) to determine whether the magnitude of
the association of ESRD with time to death after LVAD place-
ment changed over the study period.
Results
Characteristics of LVAD Recipients With and Without ESRD
From 2002-2013, 155 Medicare beneficiaries with ESRD and
261 beneficiaries without ESRD in the Medicare 5% sample re-
ceived an LVAD. Most patients (123 [79.3%]) with ESRD were
receiving maintenance hemodialysis, 12 (7.7%) were receiv-
ing peritoneal dialysis and 15 (9.7%) had a functioning kidney
transplant at the time of LVAD placement.
Among the patients with ESRD, the mean age was 58.4
(12.1) years, and 96 (62.0%) were male. Among the non-ESRD
patients, the mean age was 62.2 (12.6) years, and 196 (75.1%)
were male. Compared with patients without ESRD, those with
ESRD were more likely to be black (58 [37.4%] vs 53 [20.3]%)
and have a greater burden of comorbidity (Quan score, me-
dian [IQR]: 9 [7-10] vs 6 [4-8]) (Table 1).
Incidence of LVAD Placement in Patients
With and Without ESRD
Incidence rates of LVAD placement per 10 000 person-years
for the years 2003 to 2006, 2009 to 2009, and 2010 to 2013
were, respectively, 0.32, 0.47, and 0.45 for patients with ESRD
and 0.06, 0.13, and 0.25 for patients without ESRD.
Health Care Utilization and Outcomes
During the Index Hospitalization
Receipt of intensive procedures and time spent in the ICU dur-
ing the index hospitalization were similar for LVAD recipients
with and without ESRD (Table 2). Over half of patients with
ESRD (80 [51.6%]) died during the index hospitalization com-
pared with only 11 (4.2%) of those without ESRD. Among pa-
tients who survived the index hospitalization, the median
length of stay was slightly longer for those with ESRD (37 days
[29-45 days] vs 32 days [21-48 days]). Among patients who sur-
vived to hospital discharge, those with ESRD were less likely
to be discharged home (38 of 76 [50%] vs 172 [68.5%]) and had

 a shorter time to readmission (37 days [13-118 days] vs 81 days
[26-196 days]) (Table 2).
Death After LVAD Placement
The median follow-up time was 762 days (IQR, 92-3850 days).
Overall, 127 LVAD recipients with ESRD (81.9%) had died by the
end of follow-up compared with 95 (36.4%) of those without
ESRD. The median time to death for patients with ESRD was
16 days (IQR, 2-447 days) compared with 2125 days (IQR, 565-
3850 days) for those without ESRD. Kaplan-Meier curves
showed significantly shorter survival among those with vs
withoutESRD,withthegreatestdifferenceoccurringinthefirst
60 days after LVAD placement (Figure 2), during which time
92 patients with ESRD (72.4%) and 6 patients without ESRD
(6.3%) died.
In adjusted analyses that included an interaction term for
time from LVAD placement (P < .001), ESRD was a dominant
risk factor for death after LVAD placement (eTable in the
Supplement). The interaction for time period (2003-2008 vs
2008-2013) did not reach statistical significance (P = .06).
Heart Transplant After LVAD Placement
Among patients with ESRD, 9 (5.8%) went on to receive a heart
transplant compared with 56 of those without ESRD (25%). For

 patients with at least 1 year of follow-up data available, only 4
cohort patients with ESRD (2.9%) were alive with a heart trans-
plant 1 year after LVAD placement, compared with 29 pa-
tients without ESRD (13.0%) (Figure 3).
Discussion
Among nationally representative cohorts of Medicare benefi-
ciaries who received an LVAD over an 11-year period, mortal-
ity rates among patients with ESRD—patients who had re-
ceived maintenance dialysis or a kidney transplant prior to
LVAD placement—were exceptionally high compared with
those without ESRD. Less than half of patients with ESRD at
thetimeofLVADplacementsurvivedtohospitaldischarge,and
their median survival was only 16 days, whereas 96% of pa-
tients without ESRD survived to discharge and their median
survival was almost 6 years. At 1 year after LVAD placement,
75.2% of patients with ESRD had died and only 2.9% were alive
with a heart transplant. By comparison, 20.1% of patients
without ESRD had died and 13.0% were alive with a heart
transplant.
Survival rates among LVAD recipients without ESRD in our
study were comparable with those of previous reports.2,3,5,7
The REMATCH trial reported a 1-year survival of 52% among
LVAD recipients.1 Among Medicare free-for-service beneficia-
rieshospitalizedforLVADplacement,30-daymortalitywas9%
and 1-year mortality was 31% in 2011, representing a substan-
tial decrease since 2004.7
Several prior studies9,10,12 have examined the relation-
ship between kidney function prior to LVAD placement and
subsequent outcomes; however, they largely focused on pa-
tients with less advanced chronic kidney disease and those re-
ceivingacutedialysisfortreatmentofacutekidneyinjury.10,12,13
Our study focused on patients with ESRD at the time of LVAD
placement (median duration of ESRD was 4 years). In an analy-
sis of 280 participants from the REMATCH trial,14 those with
an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 34
mL/min/1.73 m2 not receiving dialysis had 2-fold higher odds
of in-hospital mortality after LVAD placement compared with
those with higher levels of eGFR.14 Among 227 LVAD recipi-
ents at a single center, survival was more limited among the
55 patients who were treated with acute dialysis for acute kid-

 ney injury at the time of LVAD placement.15 To our knowl-
edge, only 1 study16 may have included patients with ESRD at
the time of LVAD placement. This study included 85 patients
who were receiving dialysis at the time of LVAD placement but
did not specify whether these patients were receiving acute
or maintenance dialysis. Patients with advanced kidney dis-
ease (including those receiving dialysis) had a 3-month mor-
tality rate of 22%, which was almost 3 times that for other co-
hort members.16 However, the number of patients receiving
dialysis in this study was small, the study did not report out-
comes specifically for the subset receiving dialysis, and the
study did not distinguish between patients receiving acute vs
maintenance dialysis.
Unlike other groups undergoing LVAD placement, pa-
tients with ESRD represent a unique population already re-
ceiving1formofchroniclifesupport.17Patientsreceivingmain-
tenancedialysisaremorelikelythanpatientswithotherchronic
illness to receive intensive medical care at the end of life.17 The
median survival of 16 days after LVAD placement and high in-
hospital mortality for patients with ESRD in this study sug-
gests that these procedures are either being offered at a time
when patients are actively dying or that they actually precipi-
tate this process. A small subset of patients with ESRD did sur-
vive for longer periods of time and did go on to receive a heart
transplant, suggesting that some patients with ESRD may de-
rive benefit from LVADs.
Recentstudiesdemonstratethatend-of-lifediscussionsfor
patientswithLVADsandtheirfamilymembers,caregivers,and
physicians are often challenging, particularly decisions about
whether and when to deactivate these devices toward the end
of life.18-28 Our results may help to inform treatment deci-
sions in patients with ESRD and heart failure who are contem-
plating LVAD placement. These patients should ideally be in-
formed about the very poor prognosis of most patients with
ESRD who receive an LVAD. In the context of each patients’
goals and values, this information should then factor into
shared decision-making around LVAD placement.21
Limitations
A strength of our analysis is that we describe outcomes after
LVAD placement among nationally representative cohorts. Un-
likepriorstudiesofoutcomesamongLVADrecipientswithkid-
ney failure, which we suspect have included mainly patients
receivingacutedialysis,westudiedMedicarebeneficiarieswith
ESRD. However, these analyses have the following limita-
tions. We relied on diagnostic and procedure codes in admin-
istrative data to define and characterize the cohort, and lacked
detailed information on the clinical context in which LVADs
were placed (including information on the Interagency Reg-
istry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support [INTER-
MACS] profile). We did not have information on the indica-
tion for LVAD placement (bridge to transplant or destination
therapy), nor did we have information on the type of LVAD that
was placed. However, this approach has been used in other
studies based on administrative data when manual medical re-
view is not possible.5 We were unable to conduct separate
analyses among subgroups within the ESRD population ow-
ing to the very small number of patients in the cohort.
Conclusions
Left ventricular assist device recipients with ESRD at the time
of placement have a very poor prognosis, with less than half
surviving to hospital discharge and most surviving less than
3 weeks. This information may be crucial in supporting shared
decision-making around treatments for advanced heart fail-
ure for patients with ESRD.
