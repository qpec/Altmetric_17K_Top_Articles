IMPORTANCE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important cause of death in older patients
with breast cancer. However, limited information exists on the long-term effect of aromatase
inhibitor (AI) use on CVD risk in breast cancer survivors. To this point, no other
population-based studies have been able to adjust for CVD risk factors or cardiovascular
medications.
OBJECTIVE To determine the long-term influence of adjuvant endocrine therapies on CVD in a
cohort of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors in analyses that accounted for major CVD
risk factors, medication use, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort of postmenopausal women with
breast cancer diagnosed from January 1, 1991, to December 31, 2010, and followed up
through December 31, 2011 (maximum, 21 years [72 886 person-years]), was evaluated using
records from a managed care organization with nearly 20 community hospitals in California.
A total of 13 273 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer
without prior CVD were included. Cardiovascular disease incidence was compared across
endocrine therapy categories. Information on demographics, comorbidity, medication, use,
and CVD risk was captured from electronic health records. Multivariate Cox proportional
hazards models using time-dependent endocrine drug use variables and propensity scores
were conducted. Data analysis was conducted from September 15, 2014, to February 1, 2016.
EXPOSURES Women were grouped by endocrine therapy status (tamoxifen citrate only, AI
only, both, or neither).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Person-year rates of CVD for each therapy group.
RESULTS During 72 886 person-years in 13 273 women (mean [SD] age, 66.8 [8.1] years) with
follow-up through 2011, we observed 3711 CVD events. In multivariable analyses (reported as
hazard ratio [95% CI]), AI-only users had a similar risk of cardiac ischemia (myocardial
infarction and angina) (adjusted, 0.97 [0.78-1.22]) and stroke (adjusted, 0.97 [0.70-1.33]) as
tamoxifen-only users (reference). However, we found an increased risk of other CVD
(dysrhythmia, valvular dysfunction, and pericarditis) (adjusted, 1.29 [1.11-1.50]) in women who
used AIs only or sequentially after tamoxifen (1.26 [1.09-1.45]) vs tamoxifen (reference) as
well nonhormone users (1.18 [1.02-1.35]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The risk of the most serious cardiovascular events (cardiac
ischemia or stroke) was not elevated in AI-only users compared with tamoxifen users. The
finding that other CVD events combined were greater in AI users requires further study.

A
romatase inhibitors (AIs) are considered superior to ta-
moxifen citrate in reducing recurrence risk in post-
menopausal women with hormone receptor–positive
breast cancer.1,2 However, although tamoxifen has favorable
effects on lipid profiles, AIs have unfavorable effects, raising
questionsonwhetherthese2therapiesdifferentiallyaffectcar-
diovascular disease (CVD) risk.3-9
Because CVD is an important cause of death in older breast
cancer survivors, accurate information on such events asso-
ciated with tamoxifen and AI use is needed to inform clinical
decision making.6,7 Unfortunately, available evidence is mixed
and/or inconclusive. For tamoxifen, no cardiac protective ef-
fect was seen in meta-analyses10 of placebo-controlled, adju-
vant breast cancer trials. By contrast, in the Adjuvant Tamox-
ifen: Longer Against Shorter study,11 using tamoxifen for 10
years was associated with fewer instances of CVD compared
with drug discontinuation.
Concerns regarding the adverse influence of AIs on CVD
were raised by 2 meta-analyses12,13 of adjuvant breast cancer
trialsinwhichAIusewasassociatedwithhigherCVDrisk(odds
ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.43). The CVD outcomes in most of
the trials were based on unverified self-reports collected as in-
formation on toxic effects. Conversely, no increase in myocar-
dial infarction or stroke risk with AIs was found in recent pla-
cebo-controlled, breast cancer prevention trials.14,15 Given
inconclusive evidence, we examined the long-term influence
of adjuvant endocrine therapies on CVD in a cohort of 13 273
postmenopausal breast cancer survivors accounting for ma-
jor CVD risk factors, medication use, chemotherapy, and
radiotherapy.
Methods
Data Sources and Setting
This study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern Cali-
fornia, a managed care system with 16 hospitals and approxi-
mately 4.0 million members. Electronic health records cap-
tured information on pharmacy, outpatient and inpatient
diagnoses, census, and California state mortality data. The
health plan’
s National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epide-
miology, and End Results (SEER)–affiliated cancer registry was
used to identify patients. Kaiser Permanente Southern Cali-
fornia’
s institutional review board approved this study; writ-
ten informed consent was waived. All analysis was con-
ductedatKaiserPermanenteSouthernCalifornia;nodatawere
shared.
Patients and Design
We assembled a retrospective cohort of women with a first di-
agnosis of primary breast cancer between 1991 and 2010 and
observed them through December 2011. For eligibility, women
hadtobeolderthan18years,havepharmacybenefits,andhave
estrogen– or progesterone receptor–positive breast cancer. Of
24 837 breast cancer survivors meeting the criteria, women
with prior CVD (n = 4174) and premenopausal women
(n = 7390) were excluded, leaving a final cohort of 13 273 post-
menopausal women (Figure). Age at breast cancer diagnosis
was used as a proxy for menopausal status (age >55 years was
considered postmenopausal).
CVD Outcomes
Electronic inpatient and outpatient diagnoses, based on In-
ternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9),
identified toxic cardiovascular effects and categorized them
into 4 major groups: (1) cardiac ischemia (acute myocardial in-
farction and angina), (2) stroke, (3) heart failure and cardio-
myopathy, and (4) other events (dysrhythmia, valvular dys-
function, and pericarditis). The selection of the ICD-9 codes
was based on studies16-19 demonstrating their validity and ex-
pert opinion from the study oncocardiologist (A.B.).
Women were assigned to 1 of the 4 outcome categories
based on the date of their first diagnosis; inpatient codes were
prioritized over outpatient codes. Those with multiple CVD di-
agnoses on the same day were assigned the diagnosis with the
greatest mortality risk.16 Thus, such women were censored
(ie, follow- up ceased) on the diagnosis date of their first CVD.
Cancer Treatment and Pharmacy Data
Information on first-course cancer therapy (ie, surgery, radio-
therapy, and chemotherapy) was extracted from the SEER reg-
istry. Data on tamoxifen and AIs (ie, letrozole, anastrozole, and
exemestane) were extracted from pharmacy records includ-
ing the dispensing dates and number of days the drugs were
supplied. Total duration of therapy was calculated by sum-
ming the total days supplied starting from the earliest dispens-
ing date after breast cancer diagnosis and ending at 1 of the
study end points (defined below).
Key Points
Question What is the long-term effect of aromatase inhibitors
(AIs) on cardiovascular disease risk in breast cancer survivors?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study of 13 273 women with
72 886 person-years of follow-up, AI-only users had a similar risk
of cardiac ischemia and stroke as tamoxifen-only users.
Meaning The risk of cardiac ischemia and stroke was not elevated
in AI-only users compared with tamoxifen-only users, providing
reassurance that AIs may not increase the risk of the most fatal
cardiovascular events.

Women were classified into 1 of 4 endocrine therapy cat-
egories: (1) tamoxifen only, (2) AI only, (3) both, and (4) non-
users of endocrine therapy. Women were categorized as both
if they used tamoxifen and AIs regardless of drug sequenc-
ing. Of 2682 women in this category, 474 (17.7%) used AIs first
and therapy was then switched to tamoxifen. We retained such
women in the analyses because our goal was to examine the
cumulative effect of endocrine therapy. Women who never re-
ceived endocrine therapy or who received these agent for less
than 6 months were categorized as nonusers.
Endocrine therapies were also examined as binary time-
dependent variables (ie, 0 up to start date and 1 after start date
of each therapy) in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards
models. We calculated the person-years of endocrine therapy
exposure for each patient by summing their total exposure to
each endocrine treatment (denominator) to calculate the CVD
rates. Patients in whom endocrine therapy was switched con-
tributed person-time to the both category. The time between
cancer diagnosis and start date of the first endocrine therapy
contributed to the nonuser category, thereby reducing immor-
tal time bias. This enabled the patient’
s person-time to con-
tribute to both the endocrine treatment user and nonuser cat-
egories. The CVD outcomes (numerator of the rates) were
assigned to the drug exposure category based on the history
of all endocrine therapy used.
Covariates
Covariatesincludedageatdiagnosis,diagnosisyear,breastcan-
cerstage,race/ethnicity(fromtheSEERregistry),geocodedme-
dian household income, body mass index (BMI), medical cen-
ter, tumor characteristics, and primary cancer treatment
(surgery,radiotherapy,andchemotherapy).Comorbidities,cap-
tured in the year before breast cancer diagnosis, included hy-
pertension, diabetes mellitus, and the Charlson comorbidity
index score.20 Data on pharmacy use related to CVD therapy
and/or prevention were also extracted. These drug covariates
were coded as binary (ever or never).
Statistical Analysis
Follow-upcommencedonthebreastcancerdiagnosisdateand
ended on the date of one of the study end points (first CVD
diagnosis date, death, termination of health plan member-
ship, or study’
s end [December 31, 2011]), whichever oc-
curred first. Thus, the maximum follow-up length was 21
years.Differencesindemographics,healthcareutilization,and
tumor characteristics by endocrine treatments were first ex-
amined by χ2 or Fisher exact tests. All P values presented were
2-sided. We also calculated person-year rates of each CVD
diagnosis. For flexibility of comparisons, we presented de-
scriptive statistics for each endocrine therapy and nonuser
group. In the multivariate models, all comparisons used the
tamoxifen-only group as the reference.
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox
proportional hazards models with time-dependent medica-
tion use variables as described above; these models were ad-
justed for the aforementioned covariates. All variables se-
lected for the model were based on clinical importance and
descriptive statistics. The model accounted for the following
covariates: CVD medications, race/ethnicity, cancer stage and
patient’
s age at breast cancer diagnosis, nodal status, geo-
coded income, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, first-course
chemotherapy use, and radiotherapy. We checked for col-
linearity and conducted tests for interaction (deemed signifi-
cant at P < .05). The proportional hazards assumption was
tested via graphic plots and Schoenfeld residuals. Time since
breastcancerdiagnosiswasusedasthetimescale.Wealsocon-
ducted complementary Cox proportional hazards models that
incorporated the inverse probability of treatment weighting
based on the propensity scores for having tamoxifen or AIs
constructed using logistic regression. All analyses were per-
formed using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc). Data analy-
sis was conducted from September 15, 2014, to February 1,
2016.
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the other category of
CVD(atrialfibrillationICD-9codes427,427.31,and427.32),and
to assess the impact of radiotherapy (subset of 7982). Addi-
tional sensitivity analyses were based on adherence to endo-
crine therapies incorporating the subset of women with more
than an 80% medication possession ratio, which is consid-
ered standard adherence.21 The medication possession ratio
was estimated as the number of days supplied (excluding last
refill) divided by the number of days between the first and last
dispensedates.Wealsoconductedadditionalsensitivityanaly-
ses based on women diagnosed with stage 0 to III disease
(n = 12 924).
Results
Patients’baseline demographic characteristics, comorbidi-
ties, and CVD risk factors are displayed in eTable 1 in the
Supplement. In the study cohort of 13 273 women (mean
[SD] age, 66.8 [8.1] years) with incident breast cancer, 4207
(31.7%) received tamoxifen only, 3807 (28.7%), AI only,
2682 (20.2%), both, and 2577 (19.4%), no endocrine
therapy. Mean (SD) duration of therapy was 2.8 (2.0) years
with tamoxifen and 2.3 (1.8) years with AIs. Tamoxifen-only
users, compared with AI-only users, tended to be older, in
the lower quartile of median household income, and less
likely to be overweight or obese. Given the later dates of
marketing of AI, almost all users initiated therapy after
2000. Those exposed to tamoxifen only and those who
received both treatments tended to be healthier, with 3512
(83.5%) and 2072 (77.3%) having no prior comorbidities,
respectively, than 2568 (67.5%) of those who used AIs only
or 1892 (73.4%) nonusers.
Breast Cancer Characteristics
Endocrine therapy was strongly associated with tumor char-
acteristics (eTable 2 in the Supplement); AI-only users had
larger tumors diagnosed at higher stage and received chemo-
therapy more frequently than did tamoxifen-only users. A
larger proportion of AI-only users received breast-conserving
surgery compared with tamoxifen-only users.

Cardiovascular Disease Medications and Follow-up
Use of statins and other antilipemic agents, antihyperten-
sive, and antidiabetic medications were significantly greater
in the AI-only group (Table 1). Cardiac medication use in the
nonuser group was generally similar to that of tamoxifen-
only users.
The maximum follow-up was 21 years (median, 4.5 years).
A total of 6544 (49.3%) of the 13 273 women in the cohort
reached the end of the study, and 3711 (28.0%) patients devel-
opedCVDintheensuing72 886person-yearsoffollow-up.The
median times to incident CVD were 5.0 years (interquartile
range [IQR], 2.5-8.4 years) for tamoxifen only, 2.3 years (IQR,
1.2-4.0 years) for AI only, and 3.6 months (IQR, 1.0-40.8
months) for nonusers.
Absolute CVD Risk
Thehighestcrudeperson-yearratewasseenforotherCVD(25.3
per 1000 person-years), followed by cardiac ischemia (11.5 per
1000 person-years), heart failure/cardiomyopathy (8.6 per
1000 person-years), and stroke (5.4 per 1000 person-years)
(Table 2). The lowest rate for cardiac ischemia was seen among
AI-only users (8.1 per 1000 person-years) vs tamoxifen-only
users (11.1 per 1000 person-years). Similarly, the lowest stroke
rates were observed in the AI-only group (4.0 per 1000 person-
years) vs tamoxifen only (5.9 per 1000 person-years).
Adjusted CVD Risk
Table 3 presents the overall and adjusted HRs and 95% CIs of
the CVD events. In the full cohort, no significant difference in
risk of cardiac ischemia or stroke was seen comparing those
who used AIs only and both treatments vs tamoxifen-only us-
ers. In the Cox proportional hazards models that incorpo-
rated the inverse probability of treatment weighting based on
the propensity scores for the endocrine treatments, we again
foundnoassociations(Table3).Theconcordancemeasuresand
95% CIs for the Cox proportional hazards models for each
outcome were above 80%, demonstrating the overall good dis-
criminant capability of the models. In a sensitivity analysis
based on women with good drug adherence (medication pos-
session ratio, >80%), the HRs were similar to those in the full
cohort (eTable 4 in the Supplement). In other sensitivity analy-
ses, Cox proportional hazards models based for women with
stage 0 to III breast cancer (n = 12 924), the adjusted HRs were
again similar to results of the full cohort (n = 13 273) (Table 3).

A somewhat higher risk of heart failure and cardiomyo-
pathy was seen in AI-only users (adjusted HR, 1.10; 95% CI,
0.86-1.40) and in users of both treatments (adjusted HR, 1.27;
95% CI, 0.99-1.60) compared with tamoxifen-only users
(Table 3). In addition, women exposed to AIs only and those
who received both endocrine treatments had 29% and 26%
higher risks of the category of other CVD (dysrhythmia, ar-
rhythmia,andpericarditis),respectively,vstamoxifen-onlyus-
ers.TheHRsweresimilarwhenweranthemultivariablemodel
with and without BMI, suggesting that BMI was not a strong
confounder. Of note, the fraction of overweight/obese women
was similarly high in all 4 groups (70% in all 4 groups) (eTable
1 in the Supplement). In a sensitivity analysis limited to atrial
fibrillation, a higher HR was noted for AI-only users, but the
95% CIs included the null.
When we examined the adjusted HR for each outcome
by duration of tamoxifen (<1, 2-3, 4-5, and ≥5 years) and AI (<1,
2-3, and ≥3 years), we did not observe any statistically signifi-
cant trends, although the HRs for other CVD outcomes
increased with greater duration of AIs (vs nonusers of endo-
crine therapy) (Table 4).
Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted additional sensitivity analyses in a subset of
7982 patients who received radiotherapy. The adjusted HRs
were greater in women who underwent left-sided breast ra-
diotherapy. For example, among the AI-only cohort, in those
who received left-sided breast radiotherapy the adjusted risk
for stroke was 15% higher (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.69-1.92) and 21%
higherforheartfailure/cardiomyopathy(HR, 1.21;95%CI,0.79-
1.83) compared with those risks in tamoxifen-only users, but
the 95% CIs included the null (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In 13 273 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–
positive breast cancer, AI users had similar risk for cardiac is-
chemia (myocardial infarction and angina) and stroke as did
tamoxifen users. These results provide reassurance that AIs
may not increase risk of the most fatal CVDs. The association
between AI use and other cardiac events (dysrhythmia, val-
vular dysfunction, and pericarditis) and heart failure/
cardiomyopathy were unexpected and require further study.
Based on our literature review, to our knowledge, our analy-
sis provides the first comprehensive assessment of AI influ-
ence that accounted for CVD risk factors and cardiovascular
medication use.
The present study differs from findings of meta-
analyses12,13 of randomized clinical trials (mainly based on sec-
ondary analyses of CVD) comparing tamoxifen with AI use. In
contrast to those trials, in the present study, we excluded
women with a history of CVD and accounted for major dis-
ease risk factors. Specifically, because antilipemic (statins), an-
tihypertensive, and antidiabetes drugs were more commonly
used by women who received AI therapy compared with those
who received tamoxifen, we adjusted for these medications.
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association22 recently revised the guidelines for CVD pri-
mary prevention by expanding the indications for statins. For
example,statinuseisnowrecommendedforwomenolderthan
70yearsregardlessoflaboratoryfindingsorfamilyhistory.The
present study results suggest that oncologists should famil-
iarize themselves with these new guidelines for implementa-
tion in breast cancer survivors.

ter tamoxifen use, but such results are consistent with
either an AI effect and/or an effect of tamoxifen washout. In
the MA.17 substudy,28 although significant increases in total
cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
were seen with letrozole following tamoxifen use, no differ-
ence in CVD incidence in the letrozole vs placebo groups
was found.
Two observational studies examining AI use and CVD
provided conflicting information. Ligibel and colleagues29
found similar risks of myocardial infarction and stroke risk
among AI vs tamoxifen users or no therapy in a retrospective
studyof44 463women.However,informationonCVDriskfac-
tors or medication use was not available. In contrast, in a popu-
lation-based cohort of 2542 patients with breast cancer,
researchers30 found a significantly increased CVD risk among
AI users (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.09-1.84), but outcomes were self-
reported and covariate medication use was not collected.
The association of AIs with other CVD outcomes, includ-
ing heart failure and cardiomyopathy, was unexpected in our
study. Our literature review could not identify a potential me-
diating mechanism through which estrogen reduction by AIs
would influence these outcomes.
Our study has strengths. Although our median follow-up
time was 4.5 years, 1991 (15.0%) of the participants had more
than 10 years of follow-up, and 101 618 (80.0%) breast cancer
survivors stayed within the health plan. Even after disenroll-
ment,weascertainedCVDdeaths.Giventhemanagedcareset-
ting, bias through variable medical coverage was avoided.
Stroke, myocardial infarction, angina, and heart failure are
major clinical conditions that warrant attention and therapy
regardlessofbreastcancerrecurrencestateand,therefore,were
accurately captured in the electronic health records. Compre-
hensive pharmacy data handled as time-dependent medica-
tion variables, the set of confounders, and sensitivity analy-
ses including propensity score methods enhanced our study
design.
A unique study strength is the comprehensive attention
to CVD prevention in the Kaiser Permanente Southern Cali-
fornia health plan. Compared with multicenter, randomized
adjuvant trials, mainly conducted more than 2 decades ago,
breast cancer survivors in this health plan likely received more
attention to blood pressure control and CVD risk factor man-
agement. Our results are generalizable to the larger California
population given that racial/ethnicity distribution in the Kai-
ser Permanente Southern California database is similar to that
of the community.

on smoking, physical activity, or over-the-counter drugs, and
many records were missing BMI. However, we adjusted for hy-
pertensionanddiabetesmellitus,whicharecorrelatedwithBMI,
and used propensity score analysis. Furthermore, the fraction
of overweight/obese women was balanced across each group,
and the HR estimates were the same when we did and did not
include BMI in the multivariate models. Nevertheless, re-
sidual confounding by BMI is possible. We could not examine
the risk by type of chemotherapy because it was not available
intheelectronichealthrecord.Althoughanthracyclinesmayin-
crease CVD risk, their use was limited in the Kaiser Perma-
nente Southern California health plan. Similarly, approxi-
mately 10% of the cohort was HER2 positive, and a fraction of
these might have been candidates for trastuzumab therapy. Al-
though we adjusted for HER2 status, residual confounding by
trastuzumab might persist. However, because adjuvant trastu-
zumab became available in 2005, relatively few person-years
in this cohort were influenced by differential use. Although
women who used AIs were approximately twice as likely to re-
ceive adjuvant chemotherapy compared with tamoxifen only
users, cardiac ischemia and stroke rates were similar to those
of tamoxifen only users. Longer observation times may be nec-
essary to identify more CVD outcomes, particularly in the AI
exposed group. In addition, we could not capture chemo-
therapy regimens among women who had a recurrence (ap-
proximately 15% over a 20-year follow-up period in this health
plan). In addition, although it was necessary to ascertain the
causeofdeathfromCalifornia’
sdeathrecords,itispossiblethat
there was some misclassification.31
Conclusions
Aromatase inhibitor use was not associated with an in-
creased risk for cardiac ischemia or stroke in analyses that con-
trolled for CVD risk factors and covariate medications. The as-
sociation of other CVD outcomes with AIs was unexpected and
requires further study. Overall, the findings provide reassur-
ance when considering AI use for adjuvant breast cancer
therapy and potentially for ductal carcinoma in situ therapy
or breast cancer prevention.
