SUMMARY
Balance of cortical excitation and inhibition (EI) is
thought to be disrupted in several neuropsychiatric
conditions, yet it is not clear how it is maintained
in the healthy human brain. When EI balance is
disturbed during learning and memory in animal
models, it can be restabilized via formation of inhibi-
tory replicas of newly formed excitatory connections.
Here we assess evidence for such selective inhibitory
rebalancing in humans. Using fMRI repetition sup-
pression we measure newly formed cortical associa-
tions in the human brain. We show that expression
of these associations reduces over time despite
persistence in behavior, consistent with inhibitory
rebalancing. To test this, we modulated excitation/
inhibition balance with transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS). Using ultra-high-field (7T) MRI
and spectroscopy, we show that reducing GABA al-
lows cortical associations to be re-expressed. This
suggests that in humans associative memories are
stored in balanced excitatory-inhibitory ensembles
that lie dormant unless latent inhibitory connections
are unmasked.
INTRODUCTION
Local circuit level descriptions hold substantial promise for
providing deep insights into neural function in health and dis-
ease. In contrast to the precise descriptions with which such
mechanisms can be understood in animal experimentation,
their effect on human cognition and psychiatric disorders can
currently only be speculated about (Yizhar et al., 2011). This
forces the assumption that neural mechanisms employed during
simple tasks in animal models are directly parallel to those
that support higher cognitive tasks of relevance to human life.
It therefore remains a major challenge for contemporary neuro-
science to develop noninvasive techniques that allow for inves-
tigation of neural circuit activity in humans. Here we designed
an experiment for which we had strong predictions about the
neural circuit level mechanism from data previously observed
in animal models. We then asked whether we could use these
circuit mechanisms to predict the precise macroscopic signals
measured from the human brain.
The particular neural circuit mechanism observed in animal
models and of particular interest for both cognitive function and
dysfunction concerned the maintenance of detailed cortical bal-
ance. Synaptic input received by cortical neurons is balanced
such that excitatory and inhibitory (EI) currents are precisely
matched and stable firing preserved (Wehr and Zador, 2003;
Okun and Lampl, 2008; Haider et al., 2006; Froemke et al.,
2007; Xue et al., 2014; Shu et al., 2003). Both experimental
and theoretical work suggests that this EI balance is critical
for cortical processing, ensuring appropriate feature selectivity,
gain control, temporal precision, and noise reduction of neuronal
signaling (Wehr and Zador, 2003; Haider and McCormick, 2009;
Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011). Failure to maintain cortical EI
balance, via increased activity in excitatory neurons or reduction
in inhibitory neurons, is hypothesized to give rise to the social and
cognitive deficits observed in autism and schizophrenia (Lewis
et al., 2005; Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003; Yizhar et al., 2011).
Despite its importance, EI balance is disrupted during new
learning, a process in which information is stored by modification
of excitatory synaptic strengths (Hebb, 1949; Nabavi et al., 2014;
Song and Abbott, 2001; Song et al., 2000). Experimental work
in rodents and theoretical models now suggest that plasticity
at inhibitory synapses may play an important role in restoring
EI balance by allowing for inhibitory connections to precisely
mirror their excitatory counterparts (D’amour and Froemke,
2015; Froemke et al., 2007; Vogels et al., 2011; Xue et al.,
2014). Although detailed synaptic processes cannot be directly
accessed in humans, here we sought to use these experimental
and theoretical observations to predict the consequences of
cortical rebalancing in the human cortex. We reasoned it should
be possible to observe the macroscopic consequences of these
microcircuit processes by combining approaches that index the
similarity between subvoxel neuronal activity patterns using fMRI
with techniques that manipulate and measure local cortical
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration.
We hypothesized that when stimuli are paired together,
their neuronal activity patterns should exhibit representational
overlap at the subvoxel level, a consequence of the increase in
strength of mediating excitatory connections. Furthermore, it
should only be possible to observe this representational overlap
during periods of EI imbalance, when excitatory connections

191
 that link the different stimulus representations dominate. Such EI
imbalance has been reported immediately after learning, prior to
inhibitory rebalancing (Froemke et al., 2007). We also reasoned
that if cortical associative memories are maintained but reba-
lanced via inhibitory plasticity, it should be possible to induce a
second period of EI imbalance to re-expose cortical memories.
In line with previous investigations in both rodent motor cortex
and songbird premotor cortex (Jacobs and Donoghue, 1991;
Vallentin et al., 2016), we predicted that this second period of
EI imbalance could be induced by downregulating the concen-
tration of cortical GABA. This should lead to an increase in the
representational overlap that underlies associative memories,
in proportion to the induced change in GABA. Therefore, if asso-
ciative memories are stored in balanced excitatory-inhibitory
ensembles in the human cortex, cortical memories should lie
dormant unless latent inhibitory connections are unmasked.
To test this prediction in the human brain, we first developed
an index for the representational overlap between different sub-
voxel neural representations using fMRI repetition suppression.
Using this index to provide a macroscopic signature of associa-
tive memories, we assessed representational overlap between
paired stimuli immediately after learning. To assess the conse-
quences of cortical rebalancing we then used fMRI repetition
suppression to track changes in representational overlap over
time, before combining this approach with anodal transcranial
direct current stimulation (tDCS), a technique known to bring
about a local reduction in cortical GABA (Kim et al., 2014; Stagg
et al., 2009, 2011). Using MR spectroscopy, we measured the
accompanying change in GABA concentration in the region of
cortex to which tDCS was applied.
We show that associated stimuli exhibit fMRI repetition
suppression in cortex immediately after learning. The magnitude
of this cross-stimulus suppression correlates with memory
performance measured behaviorally, suggesting that it reflects
expression of cortical memory. This cortical memory expres-
sion reduces over time and is absent the following day. Cortical
memory can however be re-exposed by reduction in local GABA
concentrations, induced using tDCS. The extent to which the
memory is re-expressed occurs in proportion to the induced
GABA reduction. By embedding memories in a spiking network
model of memory formation (Vogels and Abbott, 2009; Vogels
et al., 2011) and replicating each experimental step in silico,
we show that these data are consistent with the balancing of
memories via inhibitory synaptic plasticity in cortex.
RESULTS
Measuring Associative Memories using fMRI Adaptation
To measure associative memories in the human cortex we
needed to index neural representations that support the asso-
ciated stimuli. With fMRI it is possible to use techniques that
provide a measure of subvoxel neural representations. Here
we used fMRI adaptation, a technique that relies on the fact
that neurons show a relative suppression in their activity in
response to repetition of a stimulus to which they are sensitive
(Miller et al., 1991; Sawamura et al., 2006). While typically used
to access the information content of a cell assembly via repeti-
tion of a single stimulus or stimulus feature (Grill-Spector et al.,
2006; Krekelberg et al., 2006; Malach, 2012), more recently
fMRI adaptation has been used to successfully index the repre-
sentational similarity of two cell assemblies that each represent
different stimuli (Barron et al., 2013). We hypothesized that
we could use fMRI adaptation here to measure representa-
tional similarity of associated stimuli by contrasting the BOLD
response to consecutive presentation of two associated stimuli
against consecutive presentation of two unrelated stimuli (Fig-
ure 1A; Experimental Procedures).
We designed a series of pilot experiments to test this pre-
diction and sought to identify a pair of stimuli which, when asso-
ciated, gave adaptation in a brain region that could be later
manipulated by extracranial stimulation inside the MRI scanner.
We reasoned that cross-stimulus adaptation should be detect-
able in a cortical region predicted by the stimulus feature relevant
for the association. For example, in recent data cross-stimulus
adaptation between two associated imagined food reward was
identified in the putative imagination network (Barron et al.,
2013; Schacter et al., 2012). In three different low-N pilot exper-
iments, participants learned to associate pairs of abstract visual
stimuli using a behavioral training task (A was paired with B,
and C with D) (Figure 1B). Stimuli were paired according to
three different properties, each designed to engage a different
cortical region (see Experimental Procedures). Immediately after
learning, cross-stimulus fMRI adaptation between associated
stimuli was assessed while participants performed an incidental
‘‘oddball’’ detection task, a task used to ensure that participants
maintained attention to stimuli without being aware of adaptation
measurements (Figure 1C; Experimental Procedures). Notably,
we controlled for potential confounds introduced by expectation
suppression (Summerfield et al., 2008) by ensuring that each
pair of stimuli was presented equally often in a fully random-
ized order. To control for attentional effects, the BOLD response
to consecutive presentation of two associated stimuli was then
contrasted against consecutive presentation of two unrelated
stimuli. To protect against concerns of multiple comparisons,
we assessed cross-stimulus adaptation for each association
by an independent regions of interest (ROI) analysis (Poldrack,
2007) (see Table S1 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures
available online).
When the defining features for the association were shape and
color (Figure 1D), significant adaptation between paired stimuli
was observed in regions of occipital and temporal cortex (Fig-
ures 1E and 1F, t8 = 1.96, p = 0.043; cf. Table S1 for ROI speci-
fication), consistent with visual areas supporting the relevant
features of this simple stimulus association. When participants
associated abstract shapes in a rotationally invariant manner
(Figure 1G), fMRI adaptation was observed within an anterior
region of lateral occipital cortex (LOC), previously shown to
represent rotational invariant features (Kourtzi et al., 2003) (Fig-
ures 1H and 1I, t7 = 2.41, p = 0.024; cf. Table S1 for ROI specifi-
cation).When participants associated the same gray abstract
shapes with an expected food reward, stimulus-reward pairs
gave adaptation in lateral orbitofrontal cortex, a region known
to respond to stimuli that predict specific reward (Klein-Flu
¨ gge
et al., 2013; Rudebeck and Murray, 2011) (Figure 1J; see Table
S1 for ROI specification). Although the result from each of these
pilot studies should not be considered in isolation due to the low
192

 number of subjects, the adaptation effect was reproducible
across all four different studies (Table S1). Critically, these pilot
studies provided a set of stimuli that could be used in combina-
tion with tDCS in a larger formal test below. In agreement with
recent findings (Barron et al., 2013), these new results suggest
that cross-stimulus adaptation can provide a measure of the
representational similarity of paired stimuli, within the cortical
region supporting features of the learned association.
Cortical Associative Memories Are Silenced with Time
Cross-stimulus adaptation therefore provides an index for
cortical associative memory formation, and by implication,
reflects the macroscopic consequences of modifications in
excitatory interconnections. Having established this index, we
went on to ask whether cross-stimulus adaptation could track
subsequent predicted modifications in excitatory and inhibitory
interconnections. Following the formation of new associative
memories in anaesthetised rodents, cortical networks are
rebalanced via inhibitory plasticity, strengthening inhibitory
connections that lie between associated cell assemblies to
quench excess excitatory activity (D’amour and Froemke,
2015; Froemke et al., 2007). These inhibitory rebalancing mech-
anism appear to have a time course of hours (Froemke et al.,
2007).We therefore predicted that the consequence of inhibitory
rebalancing upon cortical associations indexed here should be
reflected in a reduction in representational similarity between
associated cell assemblies, corresponding to a reduction in
cross-stimulus adaptation (Figure 2A).

Cross-stimulus Adaptation Immediately after Learning
(A) Left: stimuli are associatively paired: A-B and C-D. Middle and right: due
to repetition suppression, the predicted BOLD response to activation of
associated but different stimuli, A followed by B, was reduced relative to
consecutive unrelated stimuli, A followed by C.
(B) Before entering the scanner, participants learned to associate pairs of
stimuli using a three-alternative forced-choice task. On each trial, in response
to a test shape, the participant had to select the associated stimulus from
the full set.
(C) During scanning, two stimuli were presented in short succession on each
trial.
(D) Using the task shown in (B), one set of participants learned to pair colored
shapes (experiment 1), A with B and C with D.
(E) Using the stimuli shown in (D), the BOLD response to consecutive pre-
sentation of two unrelated stimuli (AC, A followed by C) was contrasted against
the BOLD response to consecutive presentation of two associated stimuli
(AB, A followed by B): ‘‘unrelated’’ minus ‘‘associated,’’ and the contrast
thresholded at p < 0.05 uncorrected for display purposes.
(F) Parameter estimates (mean ± SEM) were extracted from an orthogonal ROI
(see Table S1) in occipital and temporal cortices, for trials where stimuli were
associated (AB, A followed by B) and trials where stimuli were unrelated (AC, A
followed by C). The difference in parameter estimates for these two trial types
(AC-AB, shown on the right) gave a significant cross-stimulus adaptation effect
within this ROI (p = 0.043).

the BOLD response to consecutive presentation of two associated stimuli
(AB, A followed by B): ‘‘unrelated’’ minus ‘‘associated,’’ and the contrast
thresholded at p < 0.05 uncorrected for display purposes.
(I) Parameter estimates (mean ± SEM) were extracted from an orthogonal ROI
(see Table S1) in right temporal cortex, for trials where stimuli were associated
(AB, A followed by B) and trials where stimuli were unrelated (AC, A followed by
C). The difference in parameter estimates for these two trial types (AC-AB,
shown on the right) gave a significant cross-stimulus adaptation effect within
this ROI (p = 0.024).

et al., 2013).

 To test this prediction we performed a further pilot experiment.
We re-scanned participants from one pilot experiment (colored
shapes) on a second occasion, 24 hr after the initial session. A
significant decrease in the magnitude of fMRI adaptation be-
tween associated stimuli was observed across days (Figure 2B,
t8 = 2.37, p = 0.045; see also Figure S2A). This result is consistent
with the idea that newly formed excitatory connections are
subsequently balanced by proportional inhibitory connections
that effectively mask access to the associative overlap of under-
lying cell assemblies. However, the same negative result would
be predicted if the newly formed excitatory connections were
subsequently depressed and the association forgotten. To
disambiguate facilitation at inhibitory connections and depres-
sion at excitatory connections we adopted a more sophisticated
approach.
Predicted Consequences of Modulating GABA
If newly formed excitatory connections are subsequently
balanced by proportional inhibitory connections, it should be
possible to effectively re-expose these dormant associations
by reducing cortical inhibition. Indeed, pre-existing lateral excit-
atory connections have previously been unmasked between
motoric representations in neighboring M1 areas via pharmaco-
logical manipulation of GABA (Jacobs and Donoghue, 1991).
Applying this logic to the human brain we used a technique
known to bring about a local reduction in cortical GABA, namely
anodal tDCS. During and following cerebral direct current stimu-
lation cortical excitability is enhanced as measured by local
neuronal firing rates (Bindman et al., 1962) or remote motor
evoked potentials (Nitsche et al., 2005). This enhancement is
sustained after stimulation for minutes to hours (Bindman
et al., 1962) via a protein synthesis dependent process (Nitsche
and Paulus, 2000), contributing to its application to learning (Ja-
cobson et al., 2012) and recovery from stroke (Hummel and Co-
hen, 2006). Evidence from direct spectroscopic measurements
in vivo (Kim et al., 2014; Stagg et al., 2009, 2011) and related
electrical stimulation studies in vitro (Stelzer et al., 1987) suggest
that this increase in excitability is caused by a reduction in avail-
able GABA concentrations (Stagg and Nitsche, 2011).
Here we applied anodal tDCS to a region of cortex where
cross-stimulus adaptation was measured immediately after
learning but had since reduced with time. This led to the
following two predictions. First, a tDCS-induced reduction in
cortical GABA should selectively increase fMRI adaptation
between associated versus unrelated stimuli, owing to stronger
excitatory connections mediating the associative cell-assem-
blies (Figure 3A). Second, this predicted re-emergence of asso-
ciative memories should be proportional to the tDCS-induced
reduction in GABA.
Manipulating GABA to Re-expose Dormant Cortical
Memories
To test these predictions we applied tDCS in conjunction with
our fMRI adaptation paradigm. In parallel, we quantified the
concentration of GABA using magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRS), a technique used in vivo to measure the relative con-
centration of target metabolites in the brain. To achieve near
simultaneity in fMRI adaptation measurements and MRS quan-
tification of GABA concentration, we used 7T MRI with its
accompanying benefits of higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
and chemical shift dispersion. From our three pilot experiments,
the protocol with rotationally invariant shapes was the most
appropriate, because it produced cross-stimulus adaptation in
an accessible brain region for tDCS.
As in pilot experiments, participants first learnt to pair the
rotationally invariant shapes (Figure 3B). We then measured
cross-stimulus adaptation in two subsequent fMRI sessions
(as in Figure 1C). When participants returned 24 hr later, we com-
bined two additional fMRI sessions with the MRS and tDCS pro-
tocol (Figure 3C). The anodal tDCS electrode was placed over
the occipital-temporal location previously shown to adapt to
associated, rotationally invariant shapes (Figure 1H; mean
anodal electrode location, Figure 3D; see also Figure S1). The
cathode was placed over the contralateral supraorbital ridge.
MRS measurements were taken from a 2 3 2 3 2 cm3 voxel,
approximately centered underneath the anode (Figure S1C),
and could be rapidly acquired before, during and after tDCS
(for example spectra see Figures S1A and S1B; see Experi-
mental Procedures for further details).
As predicted, we found a significant decrease in MRS-quanti-
fied GABA concentration during tDCS compared to baseline
(‘‘baseline’’ minus ‘‘during tDCS,’’ Figure 3E, t17 = 2.81, p =
0.006). This reduction was not sustained after the subsequent
task (Figure 5A, t17 = 1.20, p = 0.123). The only other metabolite
(n = 19) to show a change in concentration at the same signifi-
cance level (p < 0.05) was glutamate, which had significantly
increased in concentration (Figure 5B, t17 = 2.22, p = 0.020),
but only at a later time point after the task.

Figure 2. Cortical Associative Memories
Are Silenced with Time
(A) Left: example stimuli that were associatively
paired: A-B and C-D. Middle and right: after
inhibitory rebalancing had occurred, cross-stim-
ulus adaptation between associated stimuli, A
followed by B, was no longer predicted in the
BOLD response as new inhibitory connections
quench excitatory coactivation. Therefore activa-
tion of associated but different stimuli, A followed
by B, was expected to be equivalent to activation
of consecutive unrelated stimuli, A followed by C.
(B) One set of participants (experiment 1) were scanned on a second occasion 24 hr after the initial scan and a significant reduction in cross-stimulus adaptation
(measured with ‘‘associated’’ minus ‘‘not’’) was observed across days (p = 0.045) (shown: mean ± SEM for each day).

 We then asked whether the tDCS-induced reduction in GABA
was accompanied by an increase in cross-stimulus adaptation,
reflecting the increase in expression of cortical associations
that would be predicted by unmasking previously inhibited
cortical associations. The analysis was tightly constrained by
our prior hypotheses and the experimental design: the increase
in cross-stimulus adaptation was expected directly underneath
the anodal tDCS electrode, at the mean cortical depth reported
in our pilot data (Figure 1H). Parameter estimates for our regres-
sors of interest were therefore extracted from the unbiased peak
tDCS electrode location (peak of Figure 3D) at the predicted
cortical depth. This precise prediction could only be made due
to the pilot experiments, reported in detail above.
If cortical memories are expressed only during periods when
cortical associations can be described as being free from inhibi-
tion or in EI imbalance, it should be possible to measure cross-
stimulus adaptation during block 1 on the first day (before
balancing) and block 2 on the second day (after unbalancing),
but not during block 1 on the second day (after balancing). The
critical test was therefore a two-way ANOVA (day * block).

with MRS and tDCS. The first fMRI task block was
followed by a baseline MRS measurement. Twenty
minutes of tDCS commenced, and a ‘‘during tDCS’’
MRS measurement simultaneously acquired. The
second fMRI task block started half way through
the tDCS session, followed by a final ‘‘post-task’’
MRS measurement. After exiting the scanner,

(F) B1 corresponds to block 1, and B2 to block 2.
Parameter estimates were extracted to obtain a

significant

was
observed immediately after learning (Day1 B1,

nificant reduction in cross-stimulus adaptation
across days (Day1 B1 minus Day2 B1, p = 0.034).
On day2, following tDCS, there was a significant
increase
in
cross-stimulus
adaptation
(Day2
B2 minus Day2 B1, p = 0.006) and the interaction
between this effect and day 1 was also significant
(day * block: [(Day2 B2 minus Day2 B1) minus
(Day1 B2 minus Day1 B1)], p = 0.010).
(G) The change in GABA concentration before
versus during tDCS correlated with the change in
cross-stimulus adaptation from Day2 B1 to Day2
B2 (with effects due to glutamate removed, r17 =
0.486, p = 0.041).

 Notably this ANOVA has in-built controls for block and day. This
test revealed a significant interaction (Figure 3F, day * block,
F1,64 = 8.05, p = 0.010), suggesting that the expression of asso-
ciative memories was restored during tDCS application. The
directionality of this interaction was verified using post hoc
t tests, which first showed a replication of our previous findings
(Figures 1I and 2B), with significant cross-stimulus adaptation
in the first fMRI session (Figure 3F, ‘‘Day1 B1,’’ t20 = 1.80, p =
0.044; see also Figures S2F and S3G). Furthermore, we again
observed a significant decrease in cross-stimulus adaptation
by the first session of Day 2 (Figure 3F, ‘‘Day1 B1’’ > ‘‘Day2
B1,’’ t20 = 1.93, p = 0.034; see also Figure S2F), but not the sec-
ond session of Day1 (Figure 3F, ‘‘Day1 B1’’ > ‘‘Day1 B2,’’ t20 =
0.85, p = 0.797), suggesting that the cortex rebalanced after
24 hr. Critically, after application of tDCS, the cross-stimulus
adaptation returned (Figure 3F, ‘‘Day2 B2’’ > ‘‘Day2 B1,’’
t20 = 3.08, p = 0.006; see also Figures S2E–S2G), confirming
that adaptation was greater during periods of putative EI imbal-
ance (Figure 3F, Interaction [‘‘Day2 B2’’ > ‘‘Day2 B1’’] – [‘‘Day1
B2’’ > ‘‘Day1 B1’’]; t20 = 2.84, p = 0.010; see also Figures S2D
and S2F). These results demonstrate that dormant neuronal
relationships can be revealed by local reduction of GABA,
suggesting that expression of cortical associative memories is
controlled by selective inhibitory connections.
Re-exposure of Otherwise Dormant Memories Is
Predicted by the Change in GABA
To further establish the relationship between the change in
GABA concentration and re-expression of an associative mem-
ory, and to assess the specific contribution of GABA, we
measured the correlation between the fMRI adaptation effect
and the change in GABA concentration across the population.
To maximize sensitivity across the group, parameter estimates
for the adaptation effect were extracted from individual-specific
regions, defined by the individuals’ peak interaction effect (see
Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This allowed us to
identify the strongest recovery in fMRI adaptation in each indi-
vidual. The increase in cross-stimulus adaptation observed after
tDCS on day 2 significantly correlated with the change in GABA
observed during tDCS (Figure 3G, r17 = 0.486, p = 0.041, after ac-
counting for changes in glutamate, see also Figures S3A–S3C).
Importantly, there was no significant correlation between these
adaptation effects and any of the other 18 metabolites measured
with MRS, including glutamate (see Figures S3D–S3G). These
results provide further independent statistical evidence that
dormant memories can be re-expressed in cortex by local reduc-
tions in GABA, and demonstrate that the effect is specific to
GABA among the 19 metabolites that we could measure with
spectroscopy.
The variation in GABA concentration observed across partici-
pants is similar to previous studies that compared real versus
sham tDCS (Stagg et al., 2009, 2011). By virtue of the precise
quantitative predictions made about the relationship between
fMRI adaptation and GABA concentration, it was not necessary
to include a separate sham condition here. The range of inter-
individual variation provided a more stringent framework within
which to test our hypotheses. In effect, fMRI adaptation
measured from participants with a lower change in GABA para-
metrically controlled for that measured from participants with a
higher change in GABA.
Behavior Predicts Cross-stimulus Adaptation
By unmasking previously silent cortical associations, our data
suggest that although the expression of cortical associations
reduces over time, learned associations may be stored as
balanced ensembles of excitatory and inhibitory connections
rather than subject to depression at excitatory synapses. This
is further supported by analysis of participants’ behavior during
a surprise memory test performed after the final scanning ses-
sion. Memory accuracy did not differ from performance at the
end of the pre-scan training on day 1 (accuracy on last block
day1 versus accuracy on day 2 (dark mauve in Figure 3C) (Fig-
ure 4A, t20 = 0.94, p = 0.821). Remarkably, this measure of
behavioral performance could be used to predict the neural in-
dex for the expression of cortical memories, measured using
cross-stimulus adaptation. Memory accuracy on the surprise
test correlated with the average cross-stimulus adaptation for
task sessions during putative imbalance (day1-block1, day2-
block2) (Figure 4B, r20 = 0.57, p = 0.007; see also Figures
S3H and S3I), but not with the average cross-stimulus adapta-
tion during putative periods of balance (day1-block2, day2-
block1) (Figure 4C, r20 = 0.016, p = 0.946; see also Figures
S3J and S3K). The correlation between memory accuracy
and the day * session interaction of cross-stimulus adaptation
showed a similar trend (r20 = 0.41, p = 0.069). This result sug-
gests that memory performance can be used to predict the

Cortical Excitability, and GABAergic and Glutamatergic
Spectroscopy Measurements
It is notable that the tDCS-induced GABA change led to an in-
crease in adaptation, and therefore reduced signal in trials with
paired stimuli compared to controls. Net increases of cortical
excitability might be expected to lead to a general increase in
measured BOLD signal. To test this, we extracted the BOLD
response for the control trials alone. Indeed, the response to con-
trol trials showed a small increase following tDCS (Figures 5C and
5D, Day2 block2 – block1: t20 = 1.81, p = 0.043; see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures for ROI specification). While this general
increase did not correlate with the GABA reduction observed dur-
ing tDCS (r17 = �0.117, p = 0.643, after accounting for changes in
glutamate), it was predicted by the change in spectroscopic mea-
surements over the course of the task. Notably, the change in
glutamate concentration over the final task (post-task – during-
tDCS) positively predicted the change in BOLD response (Fig-
ure 5E, multiple regression, see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures: t17 = 2.17, p = 0.022). The equivalent change in
GABA concentration negatively predicted the change in BOLD
response (Figure 5E, multiple regression, see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures: t17 = 1.81, p = 0.044). These opposite
effects of glutamate and GABA measurements lead to the esti-
mated change in cortical excitability (glutamate contrasted with
GABA) predicting the observed change in BOLD fMRI in the con-
trol trials (multiple regression, see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures: t17 = 2.13, p = 0.024), lending further credence to
the specificity of the spectroscopic measurements.
Simulation using a Neural Network Model
The selective re-expression of previously dormant cortical asso-
ciations was observed by combining a nonspecific tDCS-
induced reduction of GABA with representational fMRI. Individual
cortical associations could therefore be released and measured
despite the global reduction in GABA. These macroscopic obser-
vations are the logical consequence of rebalancing the cortical
circuit, where balanced excitatory-inhibitory ensembles are
maintained via inhibitory plasticity. To further illustrate how these
observations can be considered the consequences of circuit
level synaptic modifications, we refined a set of previously pub-
lished neural network models (Vogels et al., 2013; Vogels and Ab-
bott, 2009) to incorporate the experimental protocol presented
above. In the network model, we included four cell assemblies
to represent independent and nonoverlapping representations
of the four stimuli (A:D), that were balanced by local inhibition (Vo-
gels et al., 2011) (Figures 6A and S4A). Each cell assembly could
be activated individually by selectively reducing the efficacy of
the relevant local interneurons. To simulate the consequences
of learning new associations, we selectively strengthened excit-
atory connections between pairs of cell assemblies (Nabavi
et al., 2014) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Imme-
diate subsequent activation of one cell assembly (e.g., red) re-
sulted in co-activation of its associated pair (e.g., green, Figures
6B and S4B). Over time, inhibitory plasticity balanced the surplus
excitation in each assembly, restoring balance to the network
(Figures 6C, 6E, and S4C). Despite strong excitatory connections
between assemblies, coactivation was effectively silenced by the
proportionally strengthened disynaptic inhibitory connections.
Our model thus qualitatively reproduced the key features of
the experimental results: immediately after learning, paired cell

trend between the change in BOLD and the post-task change in GABA concentration (r17 = �0.424, p = 0.080, with effects due to glutamate removed) (right).

 assemblies within the network coactivated and therefore had
overlapping representations (Figures 1, 3F, and 6B; see also Fig-
ure S5B); these paired representations were separated again
when inhibitory rebalancing occurred (Figures 2, 3F, and 6C;
see also Figure S5B). In line with previous work (Litwin-Kumar
and Doiron, 2014; Zenke et al., 2015), such separation of stable
memories could not be achieved if we instead used homeostatic
scaling to stabilize network activity in the absence of inhibitory
plasticity (Figure S5C).
Having thus embedded two hidden associative memories in
the network, we then tested if these associations could be re-
exposed via a network-wide manipulation of inhibition. We
downregulated the efficacy of all inhibitory synapses by 15%,
a percent reduction inspired by previous tDCS-induced changes
in cortical GABA concentration (Kim et al., 2014; Stagg et al.,
2009). Coactivation of the previously paired cell assemblies
was recovered when either assembly was stimulated individually
(Figures 6D and 6E; see also Figures S4D, S5, and S6), and
similar results were observed when inhibition was reduced by
approximately 8%, up to approximately 40% (Figure S6).
Notably, despite the global nature of the manipulation, the result-
ing EI imbalance led to only moderate changes in the back-
ground activity but substantially amplified the effect of excitatory
connections between associated cell assemblies. By contrast,
when the network was stabilized with homeostatic scaling of
the excitatory synapses, instead of inhibitory synaptic plasticity,
it did not show these effects. Rather it produced network wide
instabilities and assembly ‘‘latching,’’ i.e., uncontrollable serial
activation of random assemblies (Figure S5C). These modeling
results illustrate how a general reduction in network inhibition
may be sufficient to selectively expose associations between
otherwise balanced cell-assemblies, and thus qualitatively
resemble the selective unmasking of otherwise dormant cortical
memories observed in humans following application of tDCS
(Figures 3F and 3G).
DISCUSSION
We have shown that otherwise dormant associative memories
can be re-expressed in human cortex by reducing the concen-
tration of cortical GABA using anodal tDCS. This was made
possible by first establishing an index for associative memories
in the human cortex using fMRI adaptation. Immediately after
learning, adaptation between associated stimuli was observed
in proportion to memory performance measured behaviorally.
By tracking this index for associative memories across time,
we show that adaptation between associated stimuli is signifi-
cantly reduced after 24 hr, but can be recovered by reducing
the concentration of cortical GABA using tDCS. These results
suggest that associative memories lie dormant in human cortex
but can be selectively expressed following changes in cortical
excitability.
By combining multiple imaging techniques with brain stimula-
tion, these data provide a macroscopic readout of cortical mem-
ory formation that reflects the consequence of underlying circuit
level processes. Taking each finding in turn, it is possible to infer
the nature of these underlying circuit level processes from
related data in animal models. For example, the neural circuit
mechanisms that accompany fMRI adaptation between recently
associated stimuli may be inferred from the following two obser-
vations in animal models. First, associative learning is accom-
panied by modifications at excitatory synapses which increase
co-activation between associated cell assemblies (Nabavi
et al., 2014). Second, neuronal adaptation is observed in sin-
gle-unit recording following consecutive presentation of different
stimuli to which a neuron is sensitive (Sawamura et al., 2006).
fMRI adaptation between recently associated stimuli may there-
fore be interpreted as an index for co-activation between asso-
ciated cell-assemblies, the consequence of excitatory plasticity
that occurs during learning.
Similarly,
the
observed
reduction
in
adaptation
across
time, but subsequent recovery following application of tDCS
may also be interpreted using neural circuit level processes
measured in animal models. Of particular relevance is the obser-
vation that modifications at excitatory synapses are accompa-
nied by complementary changes at inhibitory synapses in rodent
auditory cortex, which rebalance cortex over a time course of
hours (D’amour and Froemke, 2015; Froemke et al., 2007).
Following memory formation, EI balance may therefore be
restored by precisely complimenting excitatory connections
with inhibitory replicas, or antimemories. This is thought to
be important in providing stable storage for multiple individual
memories since antimemories can prevent spontaneous mem-
ory activation, an effect known as latching in the modeling
literature (Linkerhand and Gros, 2013; Abeles et al., 1995; Lit-
win-Kumar and Doiron, 2014; Zenke et al., 2015). Pharmacolog-
ical manipulation of rodent motor cortex suggests that formation
of antimemories may be a common feature of cortex more
generally since relief of inhibition in this cortical region also
reveals latent intracortical excitatory connections (Jacobs and
Donoghue, 1991).
In light of these data, we infer that the observed reduction in
fMRI adaptation after 24 hr reflects the consequence of modifi-
cations at inhibitory synapses which act to restore cortical EI
(E) Complete simulation of all stages of the protocol (A) through (D) in 80 min and accordingly adjusted learning rate h. Solid lines show the average activity of the
red and green cell assemblies over 2 s, and the activity of all background neurons is plotted in black. Circles show the average firing rate of red and green
assembly neurons when they are stimulated (solid circles) or when the other assembly is stimulated (open circles), at 40 s intervals. Open black circles show the
firing rates of un-stimulated background neurons during stimulations. The simulation begins with a naive network without assembly structure, firing at 5 Hz. After
four cell assemblies are introduced (t = 7 min) the firing rate of assembly and background neurons increases, but inhibitory synaptic plasticity re-stabilizes network
activity at 5 Hz. Red and the green cell assemblies can be individually activated, as shown in (A). When ‘‘associative’’ connections between the red and the green,
and the blue and yellow (data not shown) cell assemblies are introduced (t = 23.5 min), high firing rates (maximum 136 Hz) of the unstimulated network are
adjusted over the course of several minutes, but the associated cell assemblies coactivate in response to stimulation of either assembly, as shown in (B). Over
time, inhibitory plasticity refines the disynaptic inhibitory inputs to each assembly so that coactivation between associated assemblies is reduced, as shown in
(C). By reducing the efficacy of all inhibitory synapses, as thought to occur during tDCS (t = 74 min), the coactivation between associated cell assemblies is
recovered, as shown in (D).

 balance following associative learning. Recovery of adaptation
during tDCS-induced reduction in cortical GABA demonstrates
that selective inhibitory connections are otherwise responsible
for silencing adaptation between associated stimuli. Our data
are therefore consistent with the suggestion that cortical associ-
ations are stored as balanced excitatory and inhibitory ensem-
bles which remain silent unless EI balance is disrupted.
The formation of inhibitory replicas of memories, or antimemo-
ries, via inhibitory plasticity likely complements other homeostat-
ic mechanisms such as synaptic scaling (Litwin-Kumar and
Doiron, 2014; Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004; Turrigiano et al.,
1998; Zenke et al., 2015) where, following Hebbian learning,
cortical stability can be maintained via normalization of all excit-
atory synapses in the network (Turrigiano, 2008). In network
modeling, homeostatic plasticity alone is not sufficient to explain
the phenomenon of memory embedding or, more importantly,
retrieval via GABA decrease (Zenke et al., 2015). Given these
difficulties, it seems unlikely that synaptic scaling alone could
account for the data. Furthermore it does not provide a simple
explanation for the empirical observations. For example, a differ-
ence in cross-stimulus adaptation between associated and
nonassociated cell assemblies is not maintained across time
as would be predicted by synaptic scaling. By contrast, the
explanation provided for the data by inhibitory plasticity can fully
account for the empirical observations and provides a parsimo-
nious description of the data.
Although we are unable to experimentally verify this interpreta-
tion of the data, we consider our approach nonetheless impor-
tant. We have shown how a multimodal noninvasive approach
can be used to obtain macroscopic measurements of human
brain activity which reflect the consequence of neural circuit level
processes. By considering microcircuit processes previously
observed in animal and theoretical models, we used a highly
constrained experimental design to generate precise predic-
tions. From the data it was therefore possible to infer plausible
neural circuit level processes that contribute to the observed
macroscopic signal. This approach may provide a foundation
for inferring subvoxel neural mechanisms that cannot be directly
imaged in humans yet are likely to underlie neurological and
pathological disease.
Indeed, failure to maintain balance in cortex has been hypoth-
esized as a substrate for pathophysiological consequences
observed in autism, epilepsy and schizophrenia (Lewis et al.,
2005; Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003; Yizhar et al., 2011).
For example, elevating excitation in rodents introduces social
deficits (Yizhar et al., 2011), while pharmacological suppression
of inhibition rapidly leads to epileptic-like spread of synchronized
excitation to distant cortical sites (Chagnac-Amitai and Connors,
1989). Furthermore, when the balance of excitation and inhibition
is not properly maintained in a simulated neural network, the
model exhibits effects that can be related to hallucinatory and
delusional symptoms (Vogels and Abbott, 2007). Given the pro-
posed contribution of EI imbalance to this range of psychiatric
disorders, it is critical that we develop tools in humans that allow
for the underlying neural mechanisms to be uncovered.
While we have focused this investigation on the formation of
new associations in sensory regions of cortex, the question of
how balanced associative information is recalled remains perti-
nent. Interactions between different brain regions and modalities
of stored information may play a critical role. Here, to avoid con-
founding our measure of cross-stimulus adaptation, it was only
possible to test memory behaviorally at the very end of the
experiment, giving a measure for memory accuracy only when
the memory had arguably been released following application
of tDCS. It was therefore not possible to explore the nature of
memory recall following rebalancing. Nevertheless, we hypothe-
size that recall may involve the release from balance of stored
information. The advantage of maintaining inhibitory replicas of
memories is then readily apparent: multiple memories can be
stored stably, but each memory can be easily and selectively
recalled through disinhibition. By altering the strength of inhibi-
tion, it may therefore be possible to gate excitability of particular
cortical circuits. Indeed, recent optogenetic manipulation of ro-
dent cortex and hippocampus suggests that the cortex provides
a sufficient store for memories and hippocampus may serve as
the cortical gate (Cowansage et al., 2014). Having demonstrated
how circuit level activity may be indirectly indexed in the human
brain, we here provide an example protocol from which to start
investigating circuit level descriptions of memory recall and other
cognitive functions, providing a potential means to reveal the
neural computations that contribute to human cognition.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Participants
Fifty-three healthy volunteers participated in the study (see Table S1 for sum-
mary; experiment 1, ‘‘colored shapes’’: n = 9, mean age of 22.3, 5 females;
experiment 2, ‘‘rotationally invariant shapes (3T)’’: n = 9, mean age of 24.8,
7 females; experiment 3, ‘‘stimulus-reward’’: n = 10, mean age of 21.3, 6 fe-
males; experiment 4, ‘‘rotationally invariant shapes (7T)’’: n = 25, mean age
of 22.7, 11 females). Experiments 1–3 were approved by the University College
London ethics committee (reference number 3450/002), and experiment 4 was
approved by the Oxford University ethics committee (reference number MSD-
IDREC-C2-2013-20). All participants gave informed written consent.
In experiments 2 and 4, one participant was excluded due to sleepiness
during the scanning session, verified respectively using an eye tracker and
personal report. In experiment 4, an additional three participants moved
more than 5 mm during the first scanning session and were excluded from
data analyses involving fMRI measurements from this session.
Behavioral Training
Four different stimuli were presented to the participant: A, B, C, and D, with a
fully factorized randomization of stimulus allocation across participants. In
experiment 1, stimuli were colored shapes (Figure 1D). In experiments 2
and 4, stimuli were rotationally invariant gray shapes (Figures 1G and 3B),
which were observed in one of four possible rotations, with each rotation sepa-
rated by 90�. In experiment 3, stimuli were gray shapes and food reward (Fig-
ure 1J). The rotationally invariant gray shapes used in experiments 2 and 4
included four different shapes each of which could be observed in one of
four possible orientations.
Participants were trained to pair these stimuli (A with B, and C with D), using a
three-alternative forced-choice task (Figure 1B). On each trial, one of the four
stimuli was shown for 400 ms before all three remaining stimuli were presented
in randomized positions across the screen. Participants were instructed to press
the button associated with the correct stimulus’ position, as quickly and accu-
rately as possible. Accurate and fast responses were rewarded with 50 pence,
with the threshold for a fast response titrated to the participants mean reaction
time. Ten percent of trials were randomly selected at the end of each task block
and the participant received the sum total reward from these trials. Participants
were required to continue with this stimulus-item learning task until their average
reaction time per block approached 700 ms with 90% accuracy.

 fMRI Task, Data Acquisition
In all four experiments, fMRI measurements were acquired while participants
viewed a series of visual stimuli, presented via a computer monitor projected
onto a screen. The visual stimuli comprised the four stimuli used in the training
task, A, B, C, and D, except in experiment 1, where stimulus D was replaced by
a novel stimulus, E (see Table S1).
On each trial two stimuli were presented consecutively for 700 ms each, with
an interstimulus interval of 400 ms (Figure 1C). The intertrial interval was
selected from a truncated gamma distribution (experiments 1–3) or uniform
distribution (experiment 4) with mean of 4 s. To control for potential confound-
ing effects of expectation suppression (Summerfield et al., 2008), all stimuli,
and each possible pair of stimuli, were presented equally often in a fully ran-
domized order. Participants were required to perform a task incidental to the
contrast of interest which involved identifying whether the presented stimuli
were familiar or ‘‘oddball.’’ Oddball stimuli, defined as stimuli that did not
belong to the training set A to D, were randomly inserted into 10% of trials.
Participants were not required to respond if both stimuli on a trial were familiar,
but were asked to make a fast button press response if they identified an
oddball stimulus. No feedback was given.
The number of trials per block and the number of task blocks varied across
experiments (experiment 1: 3 3 25 min task blocks per day, 224 trials per
block; experiment 2: 1 3 20 min task block, 208 trials per block; experiment
3: 2 3 20 min task block, 240 trials per block; experiment 4: 2 3 20 min task
block per day, 208 trials per block). In both experiments 1 and 4, participants
were scanned on a second occasion, 24 hr after the initial scan session.
For experiments 1–3, MRI data were acquired using a 3Tesla Trio MRI scan-
ner (Siemens) with a 32 channel receive-only coil (Siemens) at the Wellcome
Trust Centre for Neuroimaging (University College London, UK) and for exper-
iment 4 only, using a 7Tesla Magnetom MRI scanner (Siemens) with 1-channel
transmit and a 32-channel phased-array head coil (Nova Medical, USA) at the
FMRIB Centre (University of Oxford). Current 7T radio-frequency (RF) coil de-
signs suffer from B1 inhomogeneity effects which were pronounced in the right
temporal lobe. To overcome this, we positioned a single barium titanate dielec-
tric pad (4:1 ratio of BaTiO3:D2O, with a relative permittivity of around �300,
and size 110 3 110 3 5 mm3) over the right temporal lobe in all 7T scanning
sessions, causing a ‘‘hotspot’’ in the RF distribution at the expense of distal re-
gions (Brink and Webb, 2014; Teeuwisse et al., 2012). During the day 2 scan,
the tDCS electrode was situated between the dielectric pad and the head.
For 3T MRI data, an echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence was used with a
32-channel coil to acquire 20 2.5 mm thick transverse slices with 1 mm gap,
in-plane resolution of 3 3 3 mm2, repetition time (TR) = 1.4 s, echo time
(TE) = 30 ms, flip angle = 90�, and field of view 192 mm. The partial volume
covered occipital and temporal cortices and in each session, 850–900 vol-
umes were collected (�20 min). For each participant, a T1-weighted structural
image was acquired to correct for geometric distortions and coregister the
EPIs, consisting of 176 1.0 mm axial slices, in plane resolution of 1.0 3
1.0 mm2, repetition time = 7.92 s, echo time = 2.48 ms, and field of view =
256 mm. A field map with dual echo-time images was also acquired (TE1 =
10.00 ms, TE2 = 12.46 ms, whole-brain coverage, voxel size 3 3 3 3 2 mm3).
For 7T MRI data, an echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence was used with a
32-channel coil to acquire 24 2.5 mm thick transverse slices with 1 mm gap,
in-plane resolution of 2 3 2 mm2, repetition time (TR) = 1.4 s, echo time
(TE) = 25 ms, flip angle = 60�, and field of view 220 mm. The partial volume
covered occipital and temporal cortices and in each session, 850–900 vol-
umes were collected (�20 min). For each participant, a T1-weighted structural
image was acquired to correct for geometric distortions and coregister the
EPIs, consisting of 176 0.7 mm axial slices, in-plane resolution of 0.7 3
0.7 mm2, repetition time = 2.2 s, echo time = 2.96 ms, and field of view =
224 mm. A field map with dual echo-time images was also acquired (TE1 =
4.08 ms, TE2 = 5.1 ms, whole-brain coverage, voxel size 2 3 2 3 2 mm3).
MRS
On day 2 of experiment 4, MRS was acquired from 21 of the 25 participants. B0
shimming was performed in a two-step process. First, GRE-SHIM (field of
view, 384 3 384 mm2; TR = 600 ms; TE1/2 = 2.04/4.08 ms; slice thickness
4 mm; flip angle 15�; slices 64; scan time 45 s) was used to determine the
optimal first- and second-order shim currents (Shah et al., 2009). The second
step involved only fine adjustment of first-order shims using FASTMAP (Gruet-
ter and Tka
´ c, 2000). The modified semi-LASER sequence, previously shown to
have minimal chemical shift displacement error (CSDE), was used with TE =
36 ms, TR = 5–6 s to acquire MRS measurements in a 2 3 2 3 2 cm3 volume
of interest (VOI), positioned next to the tDCS electrode (Figure S1C) (van de
Bank et al., 2015; Oz and Tka
´ �
c, 2011).
For each MRS measurement between 96 and 128, scan averages were
collected, giving a total acquisition time of around 10 min. Three measure-
ments were acquired for each participant, before and during tDCS, and again
after the second task block (Figure 3C).
Metabolites were quantified using LCModel (see Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures; see also Figures S1A and S1B) (Provencher 1993,
2001). Relative to baseline concentrations, the change in GABA (Figures 3E
and 5A), glutamate (Figure 5B), and other metabolite concentrations was esti-
mated both during tDCS and post-task using a two-tailed paired t test where
the direction of the effect was unknown and a one-tailed paired t test in
instances where the direction of the effect was predicted from previous data
(i.e., for GABA).
tDCS
On day 2 of experiment 4, a DC-Stimulator (Eldith) delivered a 1 mA current to
the brain while the participants were inside the 7T MRI scanner. To allow for
tDCS to be delivered inside the 7T scanner, two 5 3 7 cm MRI compatible
electrodes (Easycap) were fitted with 5 kOhm resisters to minimize the risk
of heating or eddy current induction. Using high-chloride EEG electrode gel
(Easycap) as a conducting paste, the anodal electrode was placed on the
scalp above the region of right temporal cortex previously identified as encod-
ing the association between paired shapes (Figure 3D), approximately at the
10–20 T6 node location. The cathodal electrode was placed over the contra-
lateral supraorbital ridge. A cod-liver oil capsule was taped to the center of
the anodal electrode to make the electrode MR-visible and allow for its location
to be mapped onto the anatomical brain surface (Figure S1C). The impedance
of tDCS was checked prior to the participant entering the scanner and again
once the participant was lying inside the bore of the magnet with extension
leads connected to the stimulator. tDCS involved a 10 s ramp up of the current,
which was then held at 1 mA current for a total of 20 min, before being ramped
down over 10 s. tDCS commenced after the first MRS measurement acquisi-
tion (baseline), 10 min prior to the start of the second fMRI task session (see
Figure 3C).
Postscan Behavioral Task
On day 2 of experiment 4, immediately after participants exited the scanner
they were given a surprise memory test (see Figure 3C). This involved the three
alternative forced choice design used in the behavioral training, but in the
absence of feedback (mean number of trials, 22.7).
fMRI Data Analysis
All MRI datasets were preprocessed using SPM (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/
spm/). Images were corrected for signal bias, realigned to the first volume, cor-
rected for distortion using field maps, normalized to a standard EPI template
and smoothed using an 8 mm full-width at half maximum Gaussian kernel.
For each participant and for each scanning block, fMRI data was analyzed in
an event-related manner using a general linear model (GLM) in SPM. Explan-
atory variables used a delta function to indicate the onset of a trial and were
then convolved with the hemodynamic response function. Explanatory vari-
ables were included for trials with associated stimuli (e.g., A followed by B,
or C followed by D), unrelated stimuli (e.g., A followed by C or B followed
by D), and repeated stimuli (e.g., A followed by A). In experiment 1, an addi-
tional explanatory variable was included to account for trials with stimulus E.
In experiment 2, the ‘‘unrelated’’ explanatory variable was divided in two
(i.e., C and D trials divided) to allow for an orthogonal test of cross-stimulus
adaptation. In all experiments, an additional six scan-to-scan motion parame-
ters produced during realignment were included in the GLM as additional
nuisance explanatory variables to account for motion-related artifacts.
To measure cross-stimulus adaptation the contrast of interest involved
comparing the BOLD response to associated stimuli with that of unrelated
stimuli (‘‘unrelated’’ minus ‘‘associated’’). Notably, this contrast controlled

 for attention-dependent differences in expectation suppression across
sessions (Larsson and Smith, 2012). The contrast images of all participants
were entered into a second-level random effects analysis. To test for cross-
stimulus adaptation in an unbiased fashion, parameter estimates obtained
from the GLM were extracted from an independent ROI (see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures for ROI definitions), and contrasted using a two-
tailed t test where the direction of the effect was unknown, and a one-tailed
t test in instances where the direction of the effect was predicted from previous
data. Two-tailed paired t tests were used to assess differences across
sessions.
