There is a need for further refinement of current histological systems for assessment of hepatic fibrosis in nonalcoholic fat-
ty liver disease (NAFLD). This study evaluated hepatic fibrosis in NAFLD using dual-photon microscopy-based quantita-
tion of fibrosis-related parameters (q-FPs). Fifty test cohort subjects and 42 validation cohort subjects with NAFLD and
the full spectrum of fibrosis were studied. q-FPs were measured in specific predefined regions of interest (general, vessel,
perisinusoid, and vascular septa). Seventy q-FPs had inter- and intraobserver concordance �0.8 and were related to the
NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging. Of these, 16 q-FPs with the strongest correlations (P < 0.001 for all)
were entered in a principal component analysis model (odds ratio [OR] 7.8, P < 0.001), which separated any stage of
fibrosis versus no fibrosis, and cirrhosis versus earlier stages with the areas under the receiver operating characteristic
curves of 0.88 and 0.93 (P £ 0.01 for both), respectively. In an independent multivariable analysis, four q-FPs—the num-
ber of collagen strands (OR 8.5, P 5 0.004), strand length (OR 12.0, P 5 0.02), strand eccentricity (OR 8.3, P 5 0.004),
and strand solidity (OR 8.0, P 5 0.003)—were independently associated with fibrosis stages and were used to model fibro-
sis along a continuous linear scale using desirability functions; this linear scale of fibrosis measurement was also related to
fibrosis stage (P < 0.0001). The robustness of both the multivariable model and the linear scale of measurement was con-
firmed in the validation cohort. Conclusion: The q-FP model provides an accurate reproducible method to evaluate fibrosis
in NAFLD along a quantitative and continuous scale. (HEPATOLOGY 2017;65:1891-1903).
N
onalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a
major cause of liver-related morbidity and
mortality and is expected to surpass hepatitis
C virus as an etiology for end-stage liver disease requir-
ing liver transplantation.(1) NAFLD may manifest as
nonalcoholic fatty liver or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH). NASH progresses to cirrhosis more com-
monly than nonalcoholic fatty liver and is therefore the
primary target for therapeutic development.(2)
A principal objective in drug development for
NASH is the prevention of progression to cirrhosis.(3)
Although the architectural remodeling of the liver
during progression to cirrhosis includes many compo-
nents, the fibrosis stage is a robust readout of such pro-
gression and is used for histological assessment of
disease progression.(4,5) The National Institute of
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases NASH
Clinical Research Network (CRN) system is the most
widely used system of fibrosis assessment and classifies
the disease into four stages as follows: (1a-c) based on
acinar zone 3 perisinusoidal (1a, 1b) or portal/peripor-
tal distribution (1c); (2) zone 3 plus portal/periportal
fibrosis; (3) as above, with bridging fibrosis; and (4)
cirrhosis.(6)

MERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR
 NASH has multiple strengths,(7) it also has some limi-
tations, such as sampling error related to biopsy length
and intra- and interobserver variability in assess-
ment.(8) Furthermore, such systems convert the con-
tinuous range of fibrosis into an ordinal system
introducing potential for error at the interface of differ-
ent stages. The limited dynamic scale of measurement
of current staging systems further hinders the ability to
identify modest changes in fibrosis.
There are also logistical challenges with using
histology-based assessment of NAFLD in community
clinical practice. This has fueled efforts to identify all
aspects of the disease noninvasively. Several circulating
and imaging-based fibrosis markers are currently in
development along with kinetic markers of fibrogene-
sis.(9-13) The current development path for such nonin-
vasive methods are based on traditional histological
assessment as the gold standard. From a methodologi-
cal point of view, it is not possible to outperform the
gold standard, and such developments are anchored
with the “limitations” of the histological gold stand-
ards. There is therefore a need for further refinements
in the histological assessment of NASH and hepatic
fibrosis.
Recently, dual-photon microscopy has been used for
assessment of hepatic fibrosis.(14,15) This method iden-
tifies individual collagen fibrils in unstained paraffin-
embedded tissue sections and quantifies their physical
attributes—such
as
number,
length,
diameter,
orientation, contour, and cross-linkage with each
other—within the context of hepatic architecture. It is
thus technically quite different from other quantitative
methods, such as collagen morphometry, which mea-
sures the area stained by collagen-specific stains (e.g.,
Sirius Red) and reads it out as a function of the total
area measured (collagen proportional area).(16) Proof-
of-concept studies have demonstrated that dual-
photon microscopy-based quantifiable fibrosis-related
parameters (q-FPs) can be used to evaluate fibrosis in a
rat model of fibrosis and in chronic hepatitis B.(14)
However, it has not been evaluated for NASH, which
is dominated by perisinusoidal fibrosis and formation
of central–portal and central–central vein bridges, and
thus is quite different than the mainly portal pattern of
fibrosis seen with chronic viral hepatitis.(17)
The overall objective of this study was to perform a
proof-of-concept study to evaluate and validate the
ability of q-FP–based analysis to quantitatively assess
the hepatic fibrosis in NASH. The specific aims were
to: (1) describe the spectrum of q-FPs that could be
assessed in liver biopsies from humans with varying
stages of NAFLD, (2) quantitate each measured q-FP
and evaluate the test–retest repeat variability of the
measures, (3) relate the distribution of the q-FPs to
various fibrosis stages and develop a numerical fibrosis
scoring system with an expanded dynamic scale of
measurement, and (4) validate the model in an inde-
pendent set of biopsies.

 Subjects and Methods
This study was part of a larger human study of the
natural history of disease progression and regression
performed
at
Virginia
Commonwealth
University
(VCU IRB 1960). All subjects provided informed con-
sent to participate in the study. Deidentified slides
were provided to collaborating investigators at South-
ern Medical University Nanfang Hospital who per-
formed
the
dual-photon
microscopy-based
q-FP
analysis. The q-FP analysis was then related to tradi-
tional histopathological analysis performed indepen-
dently
at
Virginia
Commonwealth
University.
Investigators at both centers participated in data analy-
sis and interpretation. The authors designed, per-

STUDY POPULATION
The study population included subjects with varying
phenotypes of NAFLD and controls with normal liver
histology as assessed by two established liver patholo-
gists (M.J.C. and M.O.I.). Liver tissue sections were
taken from tissue blocks obtained at the time of a clini-
cally indicated liver biopsy. Clinical and laboratory
data matching the time of the liver biopsy were
extracted from individual subject electronic medical
records. Control individuals for this study were identi-
fied from those who had a liver biopsy for suspected
NAFLD but were found to have <5% steatosis and no
other histological lesions including fibrosis on routine
evaluation of the biopsy. Subjects with alternate causes
of liver disease such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B, hemo-
chromatosis, and so forth were excluded. All subjects
were considered to consume <30 g of alcohol daily for
men and 20 g of alcohol daily for women based on
clinical assessment as reported previously.(18,19)
ASSESSMENT OF ROUTINE LIVER
HISTOLOGY
NAFLD was defined by the presence of �5% mac-
rovesicular steatosis. Steatohepatitis was defined using
NASH CRN criteria.(6) All cases of steatohepatitis
had steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocellular bal-
looning. Fibrosis was also staged according to the
NASH CRN criteria from stages 0 to 4. For the pur-
poses of this analysis, subjects with definite versus bor-
derline steatohepatitis were considered together, and
the substages of stage 1 were all considered as a single
stage (stage 1), the rationale being that there is current-
ly no evidence that the subclassifications of stage 1 are
linked to clinically meaningful outcomes.
DUAL-PHOTON MICROSCOPY
MEASUREMENT OF q-FPs
A paraffin-embedded section (4 lm thick) of each
sample without any specific staining was prepared for
dual-photon microscopy. Dual-photon microscopy imag-
ing and processing by imaging software was performed as
described previously.(14) Briefly, the whole section of each
slice was imaged with a 203 objective and 512 3 512
pixels of resolution, and then the images of all slices were
assessed with computerized image-analysis by two inde-
pendent investigators (J.Y. and X.L.) to output the profile
of q-FPs data for each slice. The q-FPs that were mea-
sured and applied for further analysis are listed in Sup-
porting Table S1. These q-FPs included fibrosis-related
parameters such as collagen content, the geometric and
textural features of collagen fibers, and the number of
cross-linked collagen fibers. The image analysis software
was programmed to measure collagen fibril characteristics
in operator-defined segmentation regions of the liver tis-
sue section as described previously (and as described in
Supporting Table S1).(14) These included (1) general: the
liver section in its entirety; (2) perisinusoidal: hepatocyte-
associated collagen in the perisinusoidal space, (3) vessel:
collagen fibrils directly connected to veins; and (4) vessel
bridges: collagen fibrils extending from vein to vein or
from vein to portal tract. Perisinusoidal fibrosis was
defined as the fibrosis signal that is adjacent to hepato-
cytes in the parenchyma and excluded the signal associat-
ed with vessels or septa extending from vessels. The
image analysis software is currently unable to distinguish
definitely between central veins and portal veins, and
vessel-associated collagen was not dependent on the type
of vessel. There are thus technical distinctions between q-
FP analyses of collagen versus traditional histological
methods. Interested readers are referred to previous pub-
lications on more technical details of measurement.(14,15)
APPROACH TO VALIDATE q-FP

FIBROSIS IN NAFLD
Reproducibility of the Measurements
Each biopsy was evaluated by two different investi-
gators each on two different days. The concordance

 data were then computed to determine the intra- and
interobserver agreement for each q-FP. Only q-FPs
with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) �0.8
were used for further analysis.
Defining the Spectrum of Changes in
q-FPs Across the Fibrosis Spectrum of
NAFLD
The distribution of q-FP scores across the full spec-
trum of NAFLD-related fibrosis was measured in the
test cohort. The mean value for each q-FP was nor-
malized to a value between 0 and 1 by relating it to the
total score for that q-FP across all stages. The normal-
ized mean scores were visualized in a heat map to com-
pare
the
general
distribution
of
changes
across
different stages of disease and different regions (gener-
al, perisinusoidal, vessel, and vessel bridges) of the liver
sections. The change in q-FP scores between adjacent
stages, as defined by (q-FPn11-q-FPn)/q-FPn, was
used to further visualize those that changed progres-
sively with increasing disease stage. This was per-
formed for general, vascular, perisinusoidal regions,
and vascular bridges separately.
Concordance With Traditional Histo-
logical Assessment
Spearman’s correlation coefficients were determined
to relate each q-FP to traditional fibrosis stage in the
test cohort. Of those that were significantly related, a
subset in which the q-FPs were not correlated with
each other in terms of their operational definitions
were selected to avoid colinearity and entered into a
multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis to
develop a model of q-FP evolution in NASH. The
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC) for the overall model was then computed.
In an alternate analysis, a model was developed from a
principal component analysis (PCA) of q-FPs that
were significantly correlated with fibrosis stage on uni-
variable analysis. The AUROCs were also tested in an
independent set of biopsies (validation cohort) and
related to the NASH CRN histological stage to con-
firm the robustness of the model.
Extending the Dynamic Scale of Measure-
ment by a Linearized Scale of Assessment
Validation of q-FP scores against traditional fibrosis
stages does not obviate the limitations of traditional
staging, especially with respect to an expanded dynam-
ic range with a continuous scale. This was accom-
plished by application of the desirability functions
using methodology similar to that described by us
before.(20)
Desirability functions can reset and transform the
range of scores so that the lower end reflects a biologi-
cally desirable state and is given a score of 0, while the
upper end reflects a very undesirable state and given a
score of 1. Thus for NASH, a score of 0 would be
reflective of absence of fibrosis, whereas a score of 1
would reflect the presence of cirrhosis. The best dis-
criminant score separating stages 0 and 1 based on the
regression analysis described above was set as 0. Con-
versely, the score discriminating stage 3 versus stage 4
was set as 1. All individual scores below the threshold
for 0 were scored as 0, whereas all scores above the
threshold for 1 were scored as 1.
Scores for 4 q-FP parameters found to be signifi-
cantly related to conventional fibrosis stages from the
multivariable regression model described above were
converted to a desirability function between 0 and 1.
These individual desirability functions were then com-
bined using the geometric mean to arrive at a compos-
ite measure of the overall index, such as
q-FP desirability index 5 ðd13 d23 . . . 3 d4Þ1=4:
This thus provided a composite desirability index with
an infinite scale for measurement of dynamic changes
in fibrosis. Interested readers are also referred to
detailed reviews of this methodology for the mathe-
matical background and validity of this approach.(20,21)
SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS
Sample size assessment was done with NQuery (ver-
sion 4.0). Based on a correlation coefficient of 0.8 or
higher and setting the P value at 0.05 with two-sided
testing along with a ratio of samples in the gold stan-
dard versus new method of 1, a sample size of 40
would provide approximately 100% power. Because we
were unsure of the correlation when we started, a sam-
ple size of 50 was used for the model building cohort.
Standard descriptive statistics were used to describe
the populations and quantify q-FPs. The choice of sta-
tistical tests used to compare groups was based on the
type of measure and its distribution. Intra- and inter-
observer agreement was evaluated by ICC analysis.
ICC was also used for identifying the concordance

 between q-FP measures of the virtually decreased sam-
ple length (i.e., 10 mm and 5 mm, respectively) versus
the original length of biopsies. Spearman rank correla-
tion coefficient was used for correlations between vari-
ables.
Multivariable
analysis
following
univariable
logistic regression was used to test the q-FPs indepen-
dently associated with categorical variables. PCA was
performed and provided the variables for the PCA-
based model. Two-sided P values < 0.05 were consid-
ered significant.
Results
Liver biopsy slides from 50 subjects were used as the
test cohort. The demographic, clinical, and general his-
tological findings from these subjects are shown in Table
1. The subjects were largely overweight or obese and
insulin-resistant. Individuals with a fatty liver did not
have any fibrosis (stage 0). Of those with steatohepatitis,
the fibrosis stages were more or less equally distributed
from stage 0 to stage 4 (cirrhosis). Thus, the entire spec-
trum of fibrosis associated with NASH was present in
the cohort. A second set of 42 biopsies from an indepen-
dent group of subjects were used to validate the model.
They broadly resembled the test cohort with respect to
demographic, clinical, and histological findings.
REPRODUCIBILITY OF THE
MEASUREMENTS AND OBSERVER
VARIABILITY
The q-FP parameters noted in Supporting Table S1
were measured as described previously.(14) To evaluate
the test–retest variability in these measures, the intra-
and interobserver concordances for the measures were
analyzed from 10 randomly selected liver biopsy sam-
ples encompassing all stages of fibrosis. In ICC analy-
sis, average inter- and intraobserver concordances were
0.87 6 0.30 and 0.87 6 0.29, respectively. We then
set a criterion of ICC � 0.80 for selecting the q-FP to
be used for further model development. A total of 70
q-FPs were qualified, with the final average inter- and
intraobserver agreement of 0.97 6 0.03 and 0.98 6
0.03, respectively (Supporting Table S2).
To further evaluate the impact of biopsy length on
the assessment of q-FPs, virtual sections of individual
biopsies with decreasing size were assessed in compari-
son with the ones of their original size. Data for the 70
q-FPs remained concordant (ICC 0.95 6 0.03) even
when the length of virtual sections decreased to 10 mm
from 21 mm (12-72 mm). When the length decreased
to 5 mm, the concordance dropped to 0.83 6 0.22.
THE SPECTRUM OF q-FPs
ACROSS THE RANGE OF
FIBROSIS IN NAFLD
The overall amount and pattern of collagen visual-
ized by dual-photon microscopy was similar to that
identified by traditional histological staging of fibrosis
(Fig. 1). The normalized mean values for the 70 q-FPs
selected are shown in Figure 2. The parameters over-
lapped between stages 1 and 2, likely reflecting the pres-
ence
of
perisinusoidal
fibrosis
in
both
stage
1
(perisinusoidal or periportal fibrosis) and stage 2 (peri-
portal and perisinusoidal fibrosis).(6) Visually, there was a
distinct separation with advancing fibrosis stages. The q-
FP measures were not significantly different from stage

 1a to 1b and 1c, although there tended to be higher q-FP
values associated with vessels in stage 1c (Supporting
Fig. S1). At the other end of the fibrosis spectrum, some
differences in the zonation-based subtypes of stage 4
fibrosis were evident with higher collagen fibril content,
number, length, thickness, and cross-link numbers at the
vessel region in zone 1 versus zone 3 dominant cirrhosis
(P 5 0.02-0.04) (Supporting Fig. S2).
SPECIFIC CHANGES IN q-FPs
WITH STAGE TRANSITIONS
Next, the changes in q-FPs, defined as (q-FPn11 2
q-FPn)/q-FPn, between the adjacent fibrosis stages were
evaluated (Fig. 3). From stages 0 to 1, there was an
increase in the levels of q-FPs in the general and vessel
regions; three (4.3%) q-FPs had a significant increase
(P < 0.05 for all), mainly including the q-FPs of colla-
gen fibril number in vessel region. From stages 1 to 2,
the increase was still mainly in the q-FPs in the general
section and vessel region; three (4.3%) of the total num-
ber of q-FPs mainly related to perisinusoidal collagen
fibrils were also increased significantly (P < 0.05 for
all). Although some septal parameters changed, this did
not reach significance. A total of 44 (62.8%) q-FPs
changed significantly (P < 0.05 for all) with progression
to stage 3; these included all geometric texture features
of collagen fibrils in the vessel bridges and sinusoidal
regions and the number and texture features in the gen-
eral section. Progression to cirrhosis was associated with
further changes in 25 (35.7%) remaining q-FPs (P <
0.05 for all). Overall, 47 (67.1%) q-FPs had a 1.8-fold
(1.1-3.2) increase (P < 0.01 for all) from stages 1 to 4.

ASSESSMENT
Fifty-three (75.7%) of the 70 q-FPs analyzed were
significantly
correlated
with
conventional
fibrosis
stages (P < 0.01 for all, cs 5 0.75-0.35) (Support-
ing Table S3). Among these, 16 q-FPs (22.8%)
with the strongest correlation to fibrosis stage (cs �
0.70, P < 0.001 for all) were selected for the uni-
variable
logistic
regression
analysis
(Supporting

not reach the correlation standard (cs � 0.70) and
thus was not included in the 16 q-FPs, indicating

 its inadequacy for reflecting the full range of fibrosis
progression as documented.(22)
In the first model, a PCA index was developed using
the 16 q-FPs with strongest correlation to fibrosis
stage. Regression analysis of PCA index indicated its
ability to significantly predict fibrosis stages (odds
ratio [OR], 7.8; 95% confidence interval, 3.4-18.0;
P < 0.001). It was also able to separate any stage of
fibrosis from no fibrosis and cirrhosis from lower stages
with AUROCs of 0.88 (P 5 0.01) and 0.93 (P <
0.001), respectively (Table 2).
Next, a multivariable ordinal logistic regression was
performed using parameters significant on univariable
analysis that were unrelated in terms of the physical
property being measured. These identified four q-
FPs—the number of strands (OR 8.5, P 5 0.004),
strand eccentricity (OR 8.3, P 5 0.004), strand solidity
(OR 8.0, P 5 0.003) in the general section, and strand
length (OR 12.0, P 5 0.02) in the vessel region—as
the parameters that were independently related to
fibrosis stage (Supporting Table S5). The distributions
of these parameters with increasing stage are shown in
Figure 4 and Supporting Table S6.
The AUROCs ranged from 0.81 to 0.92 and were all
significant for evaluating the ability of the four q-FPs to
correctly identify various stages of fibrosis (Table 2). The
AUROCs for the minimal model were not significantly
different from those of the PCA model described above.
EXTENDING THE DYNAMIC
SCALE OF MEASUREMENT
The four q-FPs with significance on the multivari-
able regression analysis were used to develop desirabili-
ty functions in which a score of 0 reflected the mean
scores with a traditional fibrosis stage 0 (i.e., highly
desirable), whereas the mean score for stage 4 was giv-
en a score of 1 (i.e., highly undesirable). The desirabili-
ty scores as a function of parameter score are shown in
Figure 5A-D. The overall q-FP desirability index
demonstrated a linear relationship to traditional fibro-
sis stage (Fig. 5E).
ASSESSMENT OF THE
MULTIVARIABLE MODEL AND
DESIRABILITY FUNCTIONS IN
VALIDATION COHORT
In an independent set of liver biopsies (n 5 42) scored
by an independent pathologist with no access to q-FP
data, the q-FP scores were computed by the investi-
gators. The ability of the four q-FPs to discriminate
between fibrosis stages 0-4 was reconfirmed as shown in
Figure 6; the corresponding AUROCs are summarized
in Supporting Table S7. The q-FP desirability index was
also linearly and strongly correlated (P < 0.0001) with
the traditional fibrosis stages in this set of biopsies (Fig.
5E). Furthermore, the slopes of the regression lines for
the test and validation cohorts were not significantly dif-
ferent (pooled slope 5 0.17/stage).
An additional set of four subjects who had two or
three serial biopsies over a period of 4-8 years were also
evaluated to probe the ability to tell the differences in
fibrosis between biopsy pairs. The pairs were staged to
be 3 versus 3, 1 versus 1 versus 1, 2 versus 3, and 3 ver-
sus 3, respectively. The four q-FPs all increased to a

values to the values of the particular q-FP at all the stages (F0-

trend of fibrosis content and the fibrotic pattern of progressing
NASH. Data for the test cohort are shown.

 greater degree in the subject with an increase in fibrosis
stage compared with those who maintained their fibro-
sis stage; meanwhile, they also detected fine differences
in fibrosis even within the same stage for the individual
pairs, suggesting that the q-FPs might be sensitive to
read the serial changes (Supporting Fig. S3).
Discussion
The assessment of hepatic fibrosis, as a marker of
disease progression or regression, has assumed center
stage in the evaluation of NASH.(23) The current study
represents an effort to use dual-photon–based assess-
ment of hepatic fibrosis as a further refinement of tra-
ditional histological assessment. The ability to perform
partially computerized assessment of q-FPs also carries
the potential to bring some degree of automation to
the process and thereby facilitate the overall assessment
of liver histology by the pathologist. It is, however,
important to note that histological assessment of
NASH involves evaluation of all the other features of
NASH, including disease activity, which require visual
assessment by a pathologist.(7)
An advantage of q-FP–based assessment of hepatic
fibrosis is the robustness of its accuracy over a range of

FIG. 5. Desirability functions of number of strands (NoStr), strand eccentricity (StrEccentricity), strand solidity (StrSolidity) and
strand length in vessel region (StrLengthV) and the combination of them. The mean values of the four fibrosis-related parameters
(q-FPs) found to be significant based on logistic regression (described in results section) were plotted against the desirability function
for the test cohort. The desirability function was set at 0 for stage 0 fibrosis, indicating a highly desirable state of fibrosis, whereas the
desirability function for score at threshold of stages 3-4 was given a score of 1, indicating established cirrhosis and thus an undesirable
state. The mean q-FP scores for stages 1-3 were given varying desirability scores based on the relative change in mortality risk, with
incremental stage based on mortality risk per stage.(27) (A-D) The shape of the resultant plot was used to determine the relationship
of the q-FP score to desirability function for the four parameters. (E) Overall q-FP desirability index (the geometric mean of the indi-
vidual scores for individual subjects) and its relationship to traditional fibrosis staging. There was a tight linear relationship between
the overall q-FP index and fibrosis stage for both the test and validation cohorts. The slopes of the data for the two cohorts were not
significantly different.

 liver biopsy lengths. One of the principal requirements
for high-quality traditional histological assessment of
the liver is the need for an adequate liver biopsy sample
size.(24) Indeed, many current trials mandate a biopsy
length of 2 cm or greater for subjects to be included.
However, in clinical practice, the core size obtained is
often smaller than this, and many published studies
have reported smaller liver biopsy sizes limiting the
reliability of the histologic reads.(18,19) In this study,
multiple smaller sections of the scanned tissue were
evaluated, and the results were found to be remarkably
reproducible. The q-FP method thus overcomes a
potential barrier to more accurate assessment of fibrosis
when the tissue sample obtained is less than 1.5-2 cm
in length.
Another advantage of the q-FP methodology is
that it provides a quantitative result along a continu-
ous numerical scale using the desirability functions
used in this study. Such functions have been used as
quality assessment tools in industry and are now
beginning to be evaluated in medical contexts.(21,25)
The extended dynamic range may allow assessment of
more nuanced changes in fibrosis that may not be
captured by traditional scales given their limited range

 of measurement. This may potentially allow faster
detection of therapeutic benefit in clinical trials. Fur-
thermore, measuring fibrosis along a continuous scale
overcomes the errors inherent in assessment of fibro-
sis using ordinal cutoffs.
In an era of intense ongoing research to develop non-
invasive assessment of disease status for NASH, some
may question the need for refinement of existing histo-
logical methods of fibrosis assessment. It is worth noting
that none of the noninvasive methods have met eviden-
tiary standards of biomarker qualification allowing them
to be approved specifically for assessment of hepatic
fibrosis and that their development is tied to traditional
histological assessment with its accompanying strengths
and weaknesses. The refinement of the conventional his-
tological assessment to overcome its current limitations
will not only potentially benefit therapeutic development
efforts but also benefit development of biomarkers by
serving as a better gold standard.
In the future, based on this initial cross-sectional
study, the q-FP score will require longitudinal valida-
tion against clinical outcomes to define its specific use.
Furthermore, it may permit an alternate way to evalu-
ate the range of fibrosis evolution especially from
bridging fibrosis to cirrhosis. If short-term changes
along an extended range of fibrosis assessment can be
linked to reduced risk of cirrhosis development, such
changes could be used as a surrogate endpoint to estab-
lish treatment benefit and shorten the time needed for
drug development. This is of course hypothetical and a
direction for future studies. Similarly, the findings of
collagen directly related to vascular and biliary struc-
tures corroborate and extend prior findings(26) and pro-
vide further impetus to the assessment of central and
portal veins as well as biliary epithelium in disease pro-
gression in NASH.
In conclusion, q-FP can be used as an objective,
reliable measure of fibrosis stage along a numerical
scale in subjects with NASH. Although more work
needs to be done to validate and refine the model
using much larger data sets, this study provides
proof of concept for the feasibility of developing a
quantitative numerical histological scale for assess-
ment
of
