The northern white rhinoceros (NWR, Ceratotherium simum cottoni) is the most endangered
mammal in the world with only two females surviving. Here we adapt existing assisted
reproduction techniques (ART) to fertilize Southern White Rhinoceros (SWR) oocytes with
NWR spermatozoa. We show that rhinoceros oocytes can be repeatedly recovered from live
SWR females by transrectal ovum pick-up, matured, fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm
injection and developed to the blastocyst stage in vitro. Next, we generate hybrid rhinoceros
embryos in vitro using gametes of NWR and SWR. We also establish embryonic stem cell
lines from the SWR blastocysts. Blastocysts are cryopreserved for later embryo transfer. Our
results indicate that ART could be a viable strategy to rescue genes from the iconic, almost
extinct, northern white rhinoceros and may also have broader impact if applied with similar
success to other endangered large mammalian species.

onventional
approaches
toward
establishing
a
self-
sustaining NWR population over the last two decades
have been repeatedly unsuccessful. To date only one study
related to ovum pick up and embryos production in rhinoceros
has been reported1. There has been no report of the production of
rhinoceros embryo from fertilization to the pre-implantation
stage2,3. Our results suggest that ART might offer an option for
rescuing genes from the NWR, an essential first step in saving this
nearly extinct rhinoceros sub-species. Beyond applying this
classical ART approach, it would be critical to generate artificial
gametes. ES cells are the best source for producing primordial
germ cells and also represent the “gold standard” for assessing
artificial gametes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs)4. A holistic strategy combining all three steps would help
to maximize genetic diversity in the NWR by providing cryo-
banked spermatozoa and somatic cells of several NWR indivi-
duals5. The rhinoceros and horse share a common ancestor6,
therefore, assisted reproduction techniques (ART) developed in
equines7,8 can potentially be translated to rhinoceros species,
including the Southern White Rhinoceros (SWR, Ceratotherium
simum simum), a closely related sub-species now not at risk of
extinction9. Using this technology, the NWR faces some unique
challenges; there are only two surviving NWRs and both are
infertile. They are large, somewhat intractable animals, bigger
than horse and difficult to manipulate, and ART has never been
completely successful in this species1. Reproduction through
assisted medical procedures requires safely harvesting oocytes and
spermatozoa, achieving in vitro maturation of oocytes, in vitro
fertilization, stimulating the resulting zygote to grow to the
blastocyst stage, and safely and efficiently transferring the blas-
tocyst to the uterus of a synchronous surrogate mother. Surplus
embryos can be cryopreserved for later transfer or processed as
sources of stem cell. Here, we show that rhinoceros oocytes can be
repeatedly recovered from live SWR females by transrectal ovum
pick-up (OPU), matured in vitro, fertilized by intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI) and, for the first time, develop to the
blastocyst stage in vitro. Due to a lack of sufficient numbers of
NWR oocytes (total 4, harvested post mortem), we injected SWR
oocytes with NWR spermatozoa. We also established cell lines
from the SWR blastocysts that had typical features of embryonic
stem (ES) cells, confirming the potential viability of these rhi-
noceros embryos. Pure-bred SWR and hybrid fSWR × mNWR
blastocysts were cryopreserved for later embryo transfer. Our
results indicate that ART could be a viable strategy to rescue
genes from the iconic, almost extinct, Northern White rhinoceros
and may also have broader impact if applied with similar success
to other endangered large mammalian species.
Results
Ovarian stimulation and transrectal oocyte recovery. To harvest
oocytes from rhinoceros species, we developed protocols for
ovarian stimulation (Supplementary Figure 1) to increase the
number of available follicles, as well as safe procedures for general
anesthesia and for transrectal oocyte recovery1. Based on our
preliminary data and the large body size of WR females (fWR), a
rhinoceros-specific oocyte collection instrument (patent pending)
was developed in order to reach the ovaries through the rectum.
This also required a long double-lumen needle and tubing con-
nected to an aspiration pump to recover the fluid aspirated from
the follicles (Fig. 1). The donor fSWRs are distributed across
different European zoos, and in each case the collection of oocytes
was performed on-site (with the inherent difficulties of trans-
porting all required materials). All follicles visible in the ovaries at
a size of 1 cm or larger were aspirated using an ultrasound-guided
double lumen 16 Gauge needle, in order to repeatedly flush them
to dislodge the oocyte, as is the procedure in the horse8 (Fig. 1). A
total of 18 OPU procedures were performed (Table 1) including a
post mortem collection from a deceased fNWR for natural causes
related to age (Supplementary figure 2). We recovered 83 oocytes
(26.4%) from the 314 follicles that were punctured (Table 1).
Oocytes were incubated in holding media for 24–36 h at 22 °C
during transportation to the laboratory in Italy to Cremona by
express courier for subsequent in vitro maturation, fertilization,
and embryo culture7,10.
Sperm selection for ICSI. Obtaining competent spermatozoa is
crucial in the successful development of embryos, in terms of
achieving normal fertilization, activating the oocyte, and its
healthy development to the blastocyst stage. Good quality semen,
fresh or frozen, is available from mSWR1,2,11–13. For mNWR, the
situation is more critical. The amount of semen is limited, is of
poor quality, and has been obtained from only three bulls. This
made ICSI, a routine procedure in horses, the only option that
would likely lead to success14. We obtained samples of the sperm
available from the males and tested their quality by measuring
their ability to sustain pronuclei formation and initiate early
cleavage in pig oocytes following ICSI. We assessed the frozen
semen of three mNWR and five mSWR in this way. After
thawing, the mNWR samples had poor or no motility and led to
low rates of fertilization (as determined by pronuclei formation)
and cleavage, in contrast to the mSWR spermatozoa, although
they also exhibited variable motility after thawing (Supplemen-
tary Table 1). The results were, however, improved through the
introduction of an electrical activation protocol soon after sperm
injection (two DC pulses of 1.5 kV/cm for 30 µm seconds), a
technique used for cell fusion and activation of oocytes after
nuclear transfer in livestock species15,16 and in human-assisted
reproduction clinics defined as assisted oocyte activation (AOA),
used in cases of failure to form pronuclei after ICSI and or to
undergo cleavage17–19. This dramatically increased the formation
rate of pronuclei (from 30 to 90% fertilization rate from one
mNWR) and cleavage (from 37 to 67%) in the xenogenic pig
oocyte test for two out of the three bull’s samples tested. Fol-
lowing these results, we routinely used this protocol when
mNWR sperm was used for ICSI. We also excluded the low-
performing mNWR3 sperm sample from our further work as it
would have negatively affected embryo development.
In vitro oocyte maturation and ICSI and embryo development.
Upon reaching the laboratory, oocytes were transferred to
maturation media and incubated at 37.5 °C in 5% CO2 for 36–44
h until a polar body (PB) was detected. Thirty-two oocytes
(38.6%) reached the metaphase II stage suitable for ICSI. Overall,
of 19 oocytes injected with mSWR1 sperm, six underwent clea-
vage, and three developed to blastocysts. Of 13 injected with
mNWR, six cleaved and four developed into blastocysts (Table 1).
The amount of time required for maturation was from 36 to 44 h
and the time required to reach morula compaction and blas-
tulation was 7–9 and 9–12 days, respectively. These periods were
relatively long compared to livestock species that reach the same
stages at day 5 and 8 after fertilization20. Four embryos were used
for stem cell derivation (two SWR × SWR, 051A and 051B and
two SWR × NWR, 240A and 240B). Three embryos (one SWR ×
SWR, two SWR × NWR) were cryopreserved for later transfer to
recipient females, since the embryo transfer procedure has yet to
be developed and validated in rhinoceroses. A high proportion of
embryos that started cleavage underwent compaction and blas-
tulation (Fig. 2) and were of high quality. Most of them had a
clearly detectable inner cell mass (ICM).

 ES cell line derivation and differentiation. To indirectly assess
the quality of such embryos and with the prospect of deriving
germ cells from stem cells4,5, we used four embryos for stem cell
derivation following protocols previously established in cattle21.
ES cell lines provide by comparison the best assessment of the
quality of existing rhinoceros iPS cell lines22. The two SWR ×
SWR embryos plated at day 14 and day 15, exhibited clearly
visible, large ICMs while the two SWR × NWR embryos plated at
day 12 and day 13, had considerably smaller ICMs. All the
embryos
were
micromanipulated
with
fine
needles.
The
mechanically isolated ICMs and trophoblasts were plated sepa-
rately on inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and
cultured in medium DMEM-F12 supplemented with serum
replacement and bFGF according to protocols commonly in use
for human ES cell cultures (Fig. 3). When a sufficient number of
undifferentiated cells (characterized by high nucleus/cytoplasm
ratios and large nucleoli in the nucleus, Supplementary Figure 3)
were available, we cryopreserved a proportion of them to secure
the lines. We expanded some for stem cell marker analysis,
parentage, and sex determination (Supplementary Table 5) and to
test their differentiation potential in vitro (Fig. 3). We also con-
firmed viability after repeated rounds of cryopreservation and
thawing. From each of the two SWR × SWR female embryos, we
established a cell line based on an expansion of the isolated ICM

o’clock, a sperm is visible inside the ICSI pipette ready for injection. A two-cell embryo 48 h after ICSI (b). Cleaved embryos developed to the eight cell
stage on average 5–6 days after injection (c) and were at pre-compaction stage on day 5–7 (d). Compacted morulae were visible on average at day 7–9 (e).
The first blastocyst produced was a pure Southern White Embryo (fSWR5 × mSWR1, day 11 after ICSI) (f). The zona was removed by pronase digestion and
embryo was left to expand for 2 days. From the isolated ICM of this embryo (g) and its twin obtained from the same group of oocytes (fSWR5 × mSWR1)
two ES cell lines were derived. Subsequently Hybrid Southern White × Northern White blastocysts were obtained (h) (fSWR5 × mNWR1, day 9 after ICSI).
One of these hybrid blastocysts (fSWR5 × mNWR2) naturally hatched from the zona at day 10 (i) and was used for ES cell derivation. One Southern
blastocyst (fSWR4 × mSWR1) and two hybrid blastocysts (fSWR5 × mNWR2 and fSWR8 × mNWR2 (j)) were frozen with a standard slow freezing
protocol after equilibration in 5% and subsequently in 10% of glycerol freezing media (fSWR8 × mNWR2 (k, l)). Scale bar corresponds to 100 µm

 cells. However, we were not successful in doing so with SWR ×
NWR embryos due to their lack of a well-formed ICM, probably
because they were plated 2 days earlier, and the fact that their
outgrowths were mainly of trophoblast origin. These exhibited
limited proliferation, sufficient only for a genetic analysis to
confirm sex (one male and one female) and parentage (Supple-
mentary Table 5).
The two successfully established cell lines (051A and 051B) had
normal karyotype (Supplementary Figure 7) displaying a typical
ES morphology of tightly packed cells, with a high nucleus/
cytoplasm ratio, exhibiting growth in colonies on top of feeder
cells with well-defined borders. The ES cell phenotype was
confirmed by immunocytochemistry based on the pluripotency
markers OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, and SSEA3 and by real-time PCR
(Fig. 3j). OCT4 and SOX2-specific staining was also confirmed
with monoclonal antibody staining (Supplementary Figure 4).
Negative controls for unspecific binding of primary or secondary
antibodies have been ruled out (Supplementary Figure 5). To
further confirm the nature of true embryonic stem cells, the two
established ES cell lines were induced to differentiate into neural,
mesoderm, and endoderm derivatives. Differentiation towards
the three lineages has been documented with at least three
markers per lineage (Fig. 3). Neural differentiation through the
formation of embryoid bodies and neural rosettes resulted in
TuJ1 and Peripherin-positive cells (Fig. 4). From mesodermal
differentiation beating cardiomyocytes were obtained (Supple-
mentary Movie 1). Negative controls for unspecific binding of
secondary to undifferentiated cells or primary antibodies to
fibroblasts have been ruled out (Supplementary Figures 5 and 6
respectively).
Discussion
Here we report the first ever documented generation of blastocyst,
pre-implantation rhinoceros embryos through the application of
assisted reproduction procedures that had never been previously
attempted in this species. Our results suggest that these methods
could play a valuable role in the effort to save rhinoceros popu-
lations on the brink of extinction. We also obtained embryos
from SWR oocytes fertilized with semen of NWR males, clearly
indicating the potential of rescuing genes of the NWR sub-species
through intra-specific hybrid breeding. Moreover, we report the
generation of ES cells with all the features of undifferentiated cells
and a high capacity for differentiation in the three lineages. The
next challenges will be to transfer the cryopreserved embryos into
synchronized fSWR surrogate mothers to establish and carry a
pregnancy to term. In parallel, we plan to harvest oocytes from
the last two remaining fNWR in Kenya. Currently efforts are

 underway to achieve the differentiation of rES cells to obtain
artificially generated oocytes from banked somatic cells of several
NWR individuals using iPS technology4, as a means of achieving
sustainable wide genetic diversity.
Methods
Ovarian stimulation protocol. fSWR at an unknown stage of their estrus cycle
were treated every other day with 3 ml of GnRH slow release (Histrelin® BioR-
elease, 0.5 mg/ml, Bet Pharm LLC, USA) for three or four times. Oocyte retrieval by
OPU was performed 24 or 48 h after the last slow-release GnRH injection as
reported in Supplementary Figure 1. This study was approved by the Internal
Committee for Ethics and Animal Welfare of the IZW (approval no. 2015-03-03).
Anesthetic procedures for oocyte recovery. Serial ultrasonographical repro-
ductive assessments and OPU procedures required safe immobilization and
anesthesia protocols in rhinoceroses. A combination of butorphanol tartrate (50
mg/animal), detomidine hydrochloride (30 mg/animal), midazolam hydrochloride
(20 mg/animal), and ketamine hydrochloride (200 mg/animal) was administered
intramuscularly via dart for induction. The anesthesia was maintained by intra-
venous administration of 500 mg ketamine hydrochloride, 50 mg butorphanol
tartrate, 10 mg detomidine hydrochloride, and 5 mg midazolam hydrochloride
diluted in 500 ml 0.9% sodium chloride over a period of 30–60 min (CIR = 15–35
ml/min). Subsequently, anesthesia was reversed using atipamezole hydrochloride
(70–100 mg/animal) and naltrexone hydrochloride (60–80 mg/animal)23.
Oocyte recovery by transrectal OPU. Due to the large anatomical distance of
more than 500 mm between cranial vaginal wall and the ovaries located closely to
the kidneys in white rhinoceroses1, the application of the standard transvaginal
oocyte retrieval was not possible. Therefore, a new approach was developed per-
forming the oocyte recovery through the cleaned and disinfected rectum. A 1500
mm long instrument (patent pending) guided the double lumen needle (inner
diameter 1.4 mm outer diameter 2.1 mm) in an angle to the instrument axis of 85°.
The needle was advanced directly through the rectal wall into the adjacent ovary
located cranially to the anus at a distance of 1200–1400 mm. The angled needle
could be advanced straight over a distance of up to 80 mm into the ovarian tissue.
The aspiration process was completely monitored to the depth of 150 mm by an
integrated 3D/4D real-time ultrasound transducer (5.0–9.0 MHz, RNA5-9-RS
operated by portable ultrasound unit Voluson i, GE Healthcare, Germany). Each
superovulated ovary contained up to 20 follicles on day 7 (Fig. 1). In general,
follicles larger than 10 mm were selected, aspirated, and refilled to the original size
for up to ten times by using a standard bovine flushing solution (Euroflush, IMV,
France). The solution was flushed through the outer needle channel followed by
repeated complete aspirations of the fluid through the inner needle channel using
an aspiration unit (Cook Medical, Germany) adjusted to 100 mm Hg into a closed
collection system. Flushing medium was heparinized with 20 IU heparin (Ratio-
pharm, Germany) per ml and together with the aspiration fluid were kept at 37 °C
and collected into a sterile 50-ml falcon tube (Falcon, Germany) sealed with a
silicon plug containing the needle connections and vacuum tube (Gynetics, Bel-
gium). The aspiration fluid was searched for oocytes using a 70 µm nylon mesh
filter-system (Falcon cell strainer) and a stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy,
Germany). The oocytes were collected and washed in tissue culture plates (Falcon,
Germany) followed by the transfer of each oocyte into a separate 2 ml sterile
Nalgene® cryogenic vial (Merck, Germany). The vials filled with holding solution
(H-SOF, Hepes-Synthetic Oviductal Fluid) were positioned into a portable battery-
driven oocyte IVF embryo shipping incubator (Micro Q Technologies LLC, USA)
which maintained a shipment temperature of 22 °C for up to 48 h.
Sperm recovery and cryopreservation. Semen was collected by electro-
ejaculation (Seager model 14, Dalzell USA Medical Systems, USA) from eight
captive rhinoceros bulls (n = 5 SWR, n = 3 NWR) using a hand-held stimulation
probe24 originally developed for elephants. Semen was collected into foam-
insulated 50 ml isotherm collection tubes and kept at body temperature until
analyzed. Concentration of spermatozoa in sperm-rich fractions was estimated
immediately after collection using an improved Neubauer haemocytometer. The
semen was then diluted to a concentration of ~100 × 106 spermatozoa/ml using
different, pre-warmed (36.5 °C) semen extenders: (1) Berliner Cryomedia con-
taining 6% DMSO (v/v)11,25,26 for extending NWR sperm; (2) BotuCrio, (Nidacon,
Sweden) for extending SWR sperm. Total and progressive sperm motility was
assessed after dilution and immediately post thawing. For this, 10 µl aliquots were
put on a pre-warmed slide and evaluated on a warm stage equipped phase contrast
microscope (Olympus C41; Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). From the fresh diluted
and the frozen thawed semen samples, 10 µL aliquots were fixed in 40 µL Han-
cock’s fixative for the assessment of acrosome integrity and sperm
morphology25,26. Acrosomes were classified as intact versus modified or reacted
(including completely detached acrosomes). Sperm morphology included search
for a wide range of abnormalities. In addition, 10 µl aliquots were stained for 30 s in
40 µl of a one-step eosin–nigrosin stain (Sperm Vitalstain, Nidacon, Sweden) for
assessment of sperm viability27. For viability assessment, the percentage of live
(unstained) and dead (stained) sperm cells was evaluated. For acrosome integrity,
morphology, and viability, a total of 100 spermatozoa were evaluated per slide.
Throughout the study all samples were evaluated by the same experienced sper-
matologist. Diluted white rhinoceros semen equilibrated for 15 min at room
temperature before being packaged into 0.5 ml straws and chilled for 45/120 min to
4 °C (0.5 °C/min). Straws were frozen for 10 min at 3 cm above liquid nitrogen
before being plunged into the liquid nitrogen. Freezing rates from +4 °C to −15 °C
at 3 cm above LN surface were −11 °C/min. Freezing rates from −15 to −100 °C at
3 cm were −29 °C/min. Manual seeding was performed 60 s after freezing had
started.
In vitro maturation an ICSI of oocytes and embryo culture to blastocyst. After
recovery, oocytes were held at 22 °C in H-SOF media for 24–36 h during shipping.
When delivered to the laboratory they were transferred to maturation media
composed of DMEM-F12 with 10% rhinoceros estrum serum at 37.5 °C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% of CO2 in air8 for 36–48 h. The timing
required for in vitro maturation was determined empirically in preliminary
experiments. After 36 h of maturation, the oocytes were treated with hyaluronidase
and mechanically denuded with a pipette. Those that had a polar body (PB) were
injected with sperm (ICSI), the others were returned to maturation and checked at
regular intervals for the extrusion of the PB to be subsequently injected. Frozen
semen of the selected bulls was used and live spermatozoa were separated by
density gradient centrifugation (Redigrad 1 ml 90% and 1 ml 45%). Straws were
thawed in water at room temperature and 100 µl of semen were placed on the top
of the gradient and centrifuged at 700 g for 20 min. The pellet was transferred to a
new centrifuge tube in 5 ml of TALP (Tyrode, Albumin, Lactate, Pyruvate)
calcium-free media without albumin but supplemented with 1 mg/ml of polyvinyl
alcohol and centrifuged again for 10 min at 300 g. The sperm pellet was re-
suspended in mSOF IVF medium and diluted 1:1 in PVP 10% in H-SOF just before
injection28. Oocytes were fertilized by ICSI using a piezo-driven micromanipulator
(Prime Tech, Tokyo, Japan). Single motile spermatozoa with normal morphology
were immobilized by piezo pulses and injected into the cytoplasm after piezo
drilling to cut the zona pellucida and penetrate the oolemma. Injected oocytes (day
0) were cultured in modified SOF medium supplemented with BSA and MEM
amino acids28. Half of the medium was changed on day 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Cleavage
rate was evaluated 48 h post injection and blastocyst development at days 11–15.
Oocytes injected with NWR sperm were artificially activated within 1 h after
ICSI. The oocytes were washed in a 0.3 M mannitol solution containing calcium
(0.1 mM) and magnesium (0.05 mM), then transferred to the chamber of a cell
fusion machine (SpyZot, LPS electronics, Cremona, Italy), subjected to two DC
pulses of 1.5 kV/cm for 30 µm seconds in the same mannitol solution and then
returned to mSOF media for in vitro culture at 37.5 °C in 5% CO2 and 5% O215.
Embryo cryopreservation. Expanding blastocysts on D11 to 13 with a diameter
<200 µm with a clear detectable ICM were cryopreserved using a slow freezing
protocol used for cattle and horse embryos. The embryos were equilibrated at room
temperature for 5 min in a solution of 5% glycerol in H-SOF media, then 20 min in
10% glycerol. During equilibration, embryos were loaded into plastic straws (0.25
ml, three columns of media separated by air bubbles and the embryos loaded in the
middle column). The freezing machine (Biocool IV, FTS Systems, USA; methanol
bath) was pre-cooled at −6 °C. The straws were inserted into the methanol bath
and after 5 min equilibration seeding was induced by touching the straw away from
the central column with forceps pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen. After 10 min, when
the entire straw was frozen with visible ice formed, the freezing program was
activated with a cooling ramp of 0.5 °C/min until −32 °C. The straw was then
plunged into liquid nitrogen and transferred to a liquid nitrogen tank for long-term
storage.
Stem cell derivation and characterization. Embryos from fSWR × mSWR and
fSWR × mNWR were cultured up to the expanded blastocyst stage to allow the
formation of a well-defined ICM. In order to facilitate the process of expansion, the
zona pellucida of the two SWR embryos and of one SWR × NWR embryo were
removed by pronase treatment on day 12. The second SWR × NWR embryo had a
very thin zona and hatched spontaneously on day 11. Following pronase treatment
the embryos were allowed to re-expand overnight and then the ICM was
mechanically separated from the trophoblast using insulin needles. The isolated
inner cell masses were plated on mitomycin inactivated mouse fibroblasts seeded at
a concentration of 50,000 cells per cm2. The day of plating was D14 and D15 for
the first and second SWR embryo respectively and D12 and D13 for the SWR ×
NWR embryos. The culture medium was DMEM-F12 supplemented with 20%
KSR (Knockout Serum Replacement, Life Technologies), 2 mM glutamine (L-ala-
nyl-L-glutamine, Sigma-Aldrich), 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 0.055 mM
beta-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 10 ng/ml bFGF (Peprotech, UK) in 5% CO2, 5% O2
at 37.5 °C. Seven to nine days after plating the isolated ICMs were detached from
the feeder cells by short exposure of five minutes to collagenase IV (Gibco) added
to the culture medium at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The detached out-
growths were transferred in a glass petri dish and cut in 20–30 pieces using insulin
needles and re-plated on fresh feeders. The mechanical passage was repeated a
second time for all the embryos. The undifferentiated colonies derived from the

 mechanical passaging of the two SWR embryos were subsequently exposed to a
diluted trypsin solution (0.05%) for 5 min, then gently pipetted to obtain small
cellular clumps, resuspended in complete culture medium, centrifuged and re-
plated on fresh feeders. After enzymatic passaging, the newly formed colonies were
readily visible within 24 h indicating high viability. The rES cells were subsequently
expanded every 3–4 days with a dilution factor of 1:3. The established cell lines
were characterized by a typical ES cell morphology of tightly packed cells, with high
nucleus-cytoplasm ratio, growing as colonies with well-defined borders on top of
feeder cells. Expression of ES markers OCT4 (#ab18976, Abcam, UK, dil 1:50,
Mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz, Oct3/4 sc-5279 dil 1:100), SOX2 (N1C3,
#GTX101507, Genetex, USA, dil 1:200, Mouse monoclonal, Thermofisher, #MA-1-
014 dil 1:100) and NANOG (N3C3, #GTX100863, Genetex, USA, dil 1:400), SSEA3
(MC-631, #MA1-020X, Thermofisher, USA, dil 1:200) were clearly demonstrated
by immunohistochemistry. Under the same conditions, negative controls were
performed on undifferentiated rES cells for the secondary antibody with the
omission of the primary antibody (Supplementary Figure 5) and for primary
antibodies on rhinoceros fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure 6) to rule out unspe-
cific binding. RT-PCR was also performed for OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2. To
quantify the gene expression, total RNA was extracted using RNeasy plus Mini Kit
(Qiagen 74104). One micrograms of total RNA was converted into cDNA using the
Superscript III cDNA synthesis kit (Thermofisher Scientific 18080093) as in
manufacture’s instructions. The quantitative real-time PCR was performed using
the Quantitect-SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Quiagen 204243) and the QuantStudio™ 6
Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermofisher Scientific) for the relative quantifica-
tion of genes of interest. The following were the thermal cycler conditions: acti-
vation 95 °C for 5 min, denaturation 95 °C for 30 s, annealing 60 °C for 30 s, and
extension 72 °C (repeat 40 times). Triplicate Ct values were further analyzed
(2−ΔΔCT) by normalizing to an endogenous reference gene (18srRNA). The list of
primers can be found in Supplementary Table 2.
In vitro differentiation of the three germ layers. For neural differentiation29,
embryoid bodies (EBs) were generated from SWR rESC cultured on feeder cells at
passages 5–7, when colonies were thick and clearly visible. The dishes were incu-
bated with collagenase (1 mg/ml Collagenase Type IV, Gibco) for 20 min, then the
detaching colonies were recovered and cultured in suspension in non-adherent
dishes for 4 days in the same medium as the rESC but without bFGF. For gen-
eration of neural rosettes, EBs were plated in Matrigel Coated dishes (1:100 dilu-
tion, Matrigel BD) and cultured for 15 days in DMEM-F12 supplemented with
glucose (0.6 mg/ml), 3 mM sodium bicarbonate, 5 mM HEPES, 2 mM glutamine,
100 µg/ml transferrin, 25 µg/ml insulin, 60 µM putrescine, 20 nM progesterone, 30
nM sodium selenite, 2 µg/ml heparin (all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich), and 20
ng/ml bFGF. Neural rosettes were mechanically isolated, cut into small pieces and
cultured in the same media as above, but supplemented with 10 ng/ml of bFGF and
20 ng/ml of EGF to generate a population of proliferating neural precursors mostly
p75 positive (#SC271708, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, dil. 1:100) and cultured for
at least 10 passages. To induce neural differentiation, growth factors were with-
drawn from the culture media and cells were left to differentiate for at least 21 days
in presence of ascorbic acid. After this time a network of neuron-specific BTubIII-
(#A01627, GenScript, dil. 1:100) positive cells developed, a few of these neurons
were also stained by TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) antibody (#P40101, Pelfreez, dil.
1:100) while other cells were positive to peripherin (#sc-377093 Santa Cruz, dil
1:100). (Figs. 3 and 4). Induction of the mesoderm differentiation was performed
like described in Burridge et al.30 between passage 15 and 25. In brief 4 × 105 SWR
rES cells were seeded as single cell supplemented with 10 µM Rock inhibitor
(#S1049, SelleckChem) on one well of a Geltrex-coated 6-well plate in MEF con-
ditioned media (R&D System AR005) with 10 ng/ml FGF 2 for 3–4 days until the
cells were 90–100% confluent. Thereafter the GSK 3 inhibitor CHIR99021 (#72054,
6 µM, Stemcell Technologies) was used to activate the WNT signaling pathway and
thereby the cardiac differentiation of the cells. Two days later the media was
replaced with RPMI with CDM3 supplemented with 5 µM IWP2 (# 72122, Stemcell
Technologies). Beating cells were observed earliest 10 days later as small clusters.
Endodermal differentiation was performed either using the STEMdiff™
Definitive Endoderm Kit from Stemcell Technologies (# 05110) or using Knockout
DMEM Knockout serum replacement media, (20% knockout replacement serum, 1%
Glutamax, 1% nonessential amino acids, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, with 100 ng/ml
Activin A (R&D Systems) and 0.1 ng/ml Wnt3 (Day1 only) (R&D Systems). The
differentiation media was added (2 ml) and the media was changed every other day
for 7 days.
SWR rESC-cardiomyocytes and primitive endoderm cells were seeded in a 24-
well plate fixed, permeabilized, and blocked using the kit of Thermo Fisher
Scientific (Human Cardiomyocyte Immunocytochemistry Kit, #A25973). For the
cardiac staining, the antibodies within the Kit were used and complemented with
the Myosin antibody (#10906-1-AP Proteintech, dil 1:100). The endodermal
differentiation was validated using the following antibodies at 1:100 dilutions:
GATA 4 (SantaCruz #sc-25310), GATA6 (#sc-9055, SantaCruz), Sox17 (#AF1924,
R&D). Samples were analyzed using a LSM 510 Meta inverted confocal microscope
(Carl Zeiss) and ZEN software (Carl Zeiss) and the LEICA DIMi8 and LAX
Software.
Parentage testing and sex determination. For the two established rESC lines,
cells (fSWR × mSWR) at passage 6–7 cells were pelleted after tryspinization in an
eppendorf tube. For the two hybrid embryos (fSWR × mNWR), outgrowth of
trophblast and differentiated ICM-derived cells were detached from the feeder cells
by short exposure of 5 min to collagenase IV (Gibco) added to the culture medium
at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The detached outgrowths were pooled and
transferred to an eppendorf tube with a minimal volume of media. The eppendorf
tube was centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded, stored at −80 °C, and
shipped in dry ice to the genotyping laboratory. DNA was extracted using peqGold
Tissue DNA Mini Kit (Peqlab, Germany #12-3396-02) following the manufacturer
instructions. From the hybrid embryos, we quantified the total amount of DNA in
being 170 ng for embryos 240A equivalent to 28,000 cells and 285 ng from embryo
240B equivalent to 47,000 cells. PCR was conducted with the Type-it Microsatellite
PCR Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions but running every
marker in a single 12.5 µl reaction. The touchdown protocol (63–55 °C or 58–50 °C
with 2 °C lowering for every of the first four cycles) was executed for 25–35 cycles
on a peqSTAR universal 96 gradient cycler (Peqlab, Germany). Fragment length
analysis was processed on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) with
built in Genotyper software for allele discrimination. Markers, dye labels, and
references are listed in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. The analysis of the four
samples was performed two times.
Karyotype analysis. The karyotype of the rhinoceros ESCs (between p6 and p16)
was performed by the Laboratory for Human Genetics in Berlin. In brief, meta-
phase chromosomes were obtained from rESCs following the standard protocol for
monolayer cultures and by treating the cells for 2 h with colcemid. Thereafter, the
G banding of the mitotic cell was performed. In total, two passages of the
rhinoceros ESCs were screened and 20 metaphases per passage were analyzed.
Afterwards 18 karyograms were generated (standard diagnostic procedure for
humans is to analyze 20 metaphases and to produce 5 karyograms) and no
abnormalities in terms of clonal, structural, or numeric chromosome aberrations
were detected. Chromosomes were identified and numbered according to previous
reports found in Houck et al.31. Karyotypes were documented with the Axio
Imager Z2 from Zeiss 630× and assembled using the Metafer and Ikaros software
from MetaSystems (Supplementary Figure 7).
