 Predicting and Reducing Driving
Mishaps Among Drivers With
Type 1 Diabetes
Diabetes Care 2017;40:742–750 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc16-0995
OBJECTIVE
Two aims of this study were to develop and validate A) a metric to identify drivers
with type 1 diabetes at high risk of future driving mishaps and B) an online in-
tervention to reduce mishaps among high-risk drivers.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
To achieve aim A, in study 1, 371 drivers with type 1 diabetes from three U.S.
regions completed a series of established questionnaires about diabetes and
driving. They recorded their driving mishaps over the next 12 months. Question-
naire items that uniquely discriminated drivers who did and did not have sub-
sequent driving mishaps were assembled into the Risk Assessment of Diabetic
Drivers (RADD) scale. In study 2, 1,737 drivers with type 1 diabetes from all
50 states completed the RADD online. Among these, 118 low-risk (LR) and
372 high-risk (HR) drivers qualified for and consented to participate in a
2-month treatment period followed by 12 monthly recordings of driving mishaps.
To address aim B, HR participants were randomized to receive either routine care
(RC) or the online intervention “DiabetesDriving.com” (DD.com). Half of the DD
.com participants received a motivational interview (MI) at the beginning and end
of the treatment period to boost participation and efficacy. All of the LR partic-
ipants were assigned to RC. In both studies, the primary outcome variable was
driving mishaps.
RESULTS
Related to aim A, in study 1, the RADD demonstrated 61% sensitivity and 75%
specificity. Participants in the upper third of the RADD distribution (HR), com-
pared with those in the lower third (LR), reported 3.03 vs. 0.87 mishaps/driver/
year, respectively (P < 0.001). In study 2, HR and LR participants receiving RC
reported 4.3 and 1.6 mishaps/driver/year, respectively (P < 0.001). Related to
aim B, in study 2, MIs did not enhance participation or efficacy, so the DD.com
and DD.com + MI groups were combined. DD.com participants reported fewer
hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps than HR participants receiving RC (P = 0.01),
but more than LR participants receiving RC, reducing the difference between the
HR and LR participants receiving RC by 63%. HR drivers differed from LR drivers at
baseline across a variety of hypoglycemia and driving parameters.
CONCLUSIONS
The RADD identified higher-risk drivers, and identification seemed relatively sta-
ble across time, samples, and procedures. This 11-item questionnaire could inform
patients at higher risk, and their clinicians, that they should take preventive steps
to reduce driving mishaps, which was accomplished in aim B using DD.com.

 Vehicular collisions are the eighth lead-
ing cause of death worldwide, account-
ing for 1.24 million deaths in 2010. They
are projected to be the fifth leading
cause of death by 2030 (1). In the U.S.,
35,092 fatalities and an estimated 2.44
million nonfatal injuries occurred in
2015, costing the U.S. economy more
than $99 billion (2). Compared with
spouses without diabetes, drivers with
type 1 diabetes have greater risk of ve-
hicular collisions (2), possibly because of
the acute disruptive effects on cognitive-
motor abilities during periods of ex-
treme blood glucose (BG) (3,4) and
chronic complications such as retinopa-
thy and neuropathy that can interfere
with safe motor vehicle operation (5).
However, not all drivers with type 1 di-
abetes are at an elevated risk of driving
mishaps. Research demonstrates that
compared with those without driving
mishaps, drivers with two or more mis-
haps in the previous 12 months had
greater insulin sensitivity, released less
epinephrine during hypoglycemia, had
fewer hypoglycemia-specific symptoms
(6,7), performed worse on neuropsycho-
logical tests during hypoglycemia (8),
and drove more poorly in a driving sim-
ulator during hypoglycemia (but not eu-
glycemia) (6,7). When examining drivers
who documented driving mishaps pro-
spectively over 12 months, mishaps
were not related to age, sex, duration
of disease, HbA1c, or awareness of self-
reported hypoglycemia. Instead, future
mishaps corresponded to the use of
insulin pumps, a history of collisions,
severe hypoglycemia, and hypoglycemia-
related driving mishaps (9).
In recognition of this increased rate of
mishaps among drivers with type 1 diabe-
tes, the American Diabetes Association
(ADA) released a position statement on
diabetes and driving (10), which recom-
mends that clinicians should screen for
elevated risk and intervene to reduce it.
However, no specific screening tool or in-
tervention is available. To address this
gap, we developed and tested a brief
questionnaire that would allow a clinician
to screen drivers with type 1 diabetes
for a high risk of driving mishaps (aim
A). Further, we developed an Internet in-
tervention (DD.com) intended to assist
high-risk individuals to better anticipate,
prevent, detect, and treat hypoglycemia
while driving in order to avoid future driv-
ing mishaps (aim B).
AIM A: DEVELOPMENT AND
VALIDATION OF THE RISK
ASSESSMENT OF DRIVERS WITH
TYPE 1 DIABETES
Overview
A screening questionnaire was created
in two phases: development (study 1)
and validation (study 2). In study 1, driving-
relevant psychometrically sound question-
naires were administered to drivers with
type 1 diabetes, who were then followed
monthly for a year to document the occur-
rence of driving mishaps. Post hoc analyses
selected 11 items that predicted drivers
who would subsequently experience driv-
ing mishaps. These items were then used
to create the Risk Assessment of Diabetic
Drivers (RADD) (professional.diabetes.org/
radd). Study 2 measured the validity of the
RADD by comparing screening categoriza-
tions to rates of mishaps over a prospective
12-month observation period.
STUDY 1: RADD DEVELOPMENT
Hypotheses
It was hypothesized that more driving
mishaps would be reported by individuals
who 1) have a reduced concern for hypo-
glycemia (Hypoglycemic Fear Survey
[HFS] [11]), 2) mismanage hypoglycemia
(Risk Assessment of Severe Hypoglycemia
[RASH] [12]), 3) have significant concerns
about hyperglycemia (Hyperglycemia
Avoidance Scale [HAS] [13]), 4) have a his-
tory of driving mishaps, 5) drive exten-
sively, 6) report impaired awareness of
hypoglycemia (14), and 7) have retinopa-
thy and/or neuropathy.
Methods
Participants
The study sample and methods have been
presented in detail elsewhere (9). Partici-
pants were 536 active drivers with type 1
diabetes recruited from Boston, MA
(Joslin Diabetes Center), central Virginia
(University of Virginia), and Minneapolis,
MN (International Diabetes Center), as
part of a year-long study of driving per-
formance. Participants were recruited
through newspaper, radio, and diabetes
media ads, and were eligible if they 1)
had type 1diabetesfor at least 12 months,
2) performed self-measurement of BG
at least two times daily, 3) had a valid
driver’s license, and 4) drove at least
5,000miles/year. Afterexcludingindividuals
withincompletedata,theremainingsample
consisted of 371 drivers with the following
characteristics: mean age, 42.5 6 12.5
years; 48% male; mean diabetes dura-
tion, 24.5 6 12.9 years; and an estimated
HbA1c of7.8 6 0.8% (62 mmol/mol6 8.7)
(15). The median range of miles driven
was 12,000–14,000 miles/year.
Procedure
Participants completed the HFS (11),
RASH (12), and HAS (13); a hypoglycemia
awareness scale (14); a questionnaire as-
sessing demographics, driving history, and
diagnoses of retinopathy, neuropathy, or
cardiovascular disease; and both visual
acuity and peripheral vision screening us-
ing the Department of Motor Vehicle’s
Titmus 2n Vision Screener. Subsequently,
participants were followed monthly with
e-mailmessagesaskingthemtoreportthe
number of driving mishaps they had in
that monthdthe primary outcome vari-
able. The driving mishaps selected for in-
clusion in these monthly diaries were
based on focus groups and our past re-
search (9), and represented dangerous
driving situations that either involved a
collision or could have resulted in a colli-
sion. Driving mishaps were defined as
collisions, moving vehicle violations, epi-
sodes of severe hypoglycemia while driv-
ing, loss of vehicle control, automatic
driving (finding themselves at a destina-
tion with no awareness of the drive),
and instances of impaired driving in which
someone else took over driving (9).
To maximize precision of the measure-
ments, item response modeling tech-
niques (16,17) estimated latent trait
scores for subscales or individual items of
the scales administered. These scores be-
came indicators in a logistic regression
model (18,19) predicting low risk (LR; no
or one mishap) versus high risk (HR; more
than one mishap) for driving mishaps. The
best-fitting model was established, retain-
ing the significant predictors. This model
was then compared, using the Vuong
closeness test (20), with an identical model
(same predictors) in which the item re-
sponse modeling technique scores were
replaced by summed raw scores. Findings
indicated no significant difference be-
tween the two models (P . 0.05). There-
fore, we used the simpler model using the
summed raw score for all further classifi-
cation analyses (see Table 1 for RADD
items and scoring). Finally, a receiver op-
erating characteristic curve based on the
summed raw scores model was con-
structed and examined to establish a cut
point for classification into the HR group.

 Results
Over the 12-month follow-up period,
participants reported an average of
1.77 6 3.26 driving mishaps/driver/
year, with 8.4% reporting six or more
driving mishaps. The logistic regression
model revealed that annual driving dis-
tance, peripheral neuropathy, number
of past hypoglycemia-related driving
mishaps, and the RASH subscale mea-
suring the degree to which the individ-
ual is bothered by hypoglycemia in
general, were all statistically significant
independent predictors of risk for future
driving mishaps (P , 0.05). Table 1 pre-
sents the questions used in this model,
the response options, and the scoring
procedures used to predict the probabil-
ity of being at higher risk for future driv-
ing mishaps.
The logistic regression equation used
to calculate the RADD risk was:
A receiver operating characteristic curve
(Supplementary Fig. 1) was constructed
by computing the sensitivity and specific-
ity at probability cut points ranging from
0.01 to 0.99. The area under the curve, a
global measure of model performance,
was estimated to be 0.73, indicating
that the model performed better than
chance at classifying participants into
the two risk categories. Further examina-
tion suggested an optimal cut point at a
risk index score of 0.339, corresponding
to 61% sensitivity (correct classification as
HR) and 75% specificity (correct classifica-
tion as LR). Overall, the model classified
37.5% of participants as HR. These partic-
ipants averaged 3.03 6 4.39 driving mis-
haps during the 12-month follow-up
period. Conversely, the participants in-
cluded in the lowest 37.5%, who had
risk scores below 0.248, reported signifi-
cantly fewer driving mishaps (mean
0.87 6 1.92; P = 0.002) (Fig. 1).
STUDY 2: RADD VALIDATION
Hypotheses
It was hypothesized that 1) the distribu-
tion of RADD scores between studies
1 and 2 would be similar, and 2) using
the same cutoff criteria established in
study 1, the RADD would identify a sub-
group of drivers with type 1 diabetes
who had a higher rate of driving mishaps
over the subsequent 12 months.
Methods
Participants
Participants were recruited through di-
abetes websites (e.g., MyGlu.org, dLife
.com, Dex4.com), professional organiza-
tions (American Association of Diabetes
Educators), and by direct referral from
clinicians. A total of 1,739 drivers from
all 50 states consented to complete an
online screening questionnaire in order
to determine whether they were eligi-
ble for the intervention study. The
screening questionnaire included the
RADD.
The study 2 sample comprised 1,404
drivers; this sample was compared with
the distribution of RADD scores from
study 1. Of the 1,739 screened partici-
pants, 335 were excluded because they
did not have type 1 diabetes (n = 45),
had diabetes for ,1 year (n = 26), did
not perform self-monitoring of BG at
least twice a day (n = 37), did not
have a driver’s license (n = 1), did not
drive more than 5,000 miles/year (n =
225), or applied after the study had
closed (n = 29). Twenty-eight partici-
pants met more than one exclusion cri-
terion. The mean age of this sample was
40.2 6 13.6 years; 245 participants
were between the ages of 18 and
25 years, and 32 were older than
65 years. Men comprised 48% of the
sample. The median reported range of
miles driven annually was 12,000–
14,000.
Of these 1,404 individuals, 493 quali-
fied for the prospective intervention
arm of study 2 and signed an online

 consent form to participate. Drivers
were excluded if, in addition to the
above-mentioned criteria, they had an
intermediate risk score (0.248–0.339)
or lacked routine access to the Internet
(n = 324), qualified for the LR group
after it was already full (n = 339), de-
cided not to participate in the study
intervention (n = 186), or were in-
cluded but randomized to the wrong
group because of a clerical error that
was later corrected (n = 79). Seventeen
participants met more than one exclu-
sion criterion.
Procedure
Between March 2012 and June 2013,
1,739 interested individuals signed the
online consent form and completed an
online screening questionnaire that in-
cluded the RADD. The screening RADD
used in study 2 differed slightly from
that used in study 1 in two ways: 1)
there were slight wording differences
(e.g., “How many miles do you drive per
year?” vs. “On average, how many miles
do you drive in a typical year?”), and 2)
the time frame for assessing driving mis-
hapsdiffered.Itwas changed from “In the
past 2 years” to “In the past 12 months,”
assuming a shorter time frame would re-
sult in more accurate recall.
A total of 493 candidates completed
the screening, qualified for the interven-
tion study, and signed the online con-
sent form to participate. Of these,
240 participants were assigned to the
routine care (RC) group. They received
no Internet intervention, and thus
formed the sample for prospectively
validating the RADD categorizations.
Among these RC participants, 122 were
classified as HR (RADD score $0.339),
and 118 were classified as LR (RADD
score #0.248). As in study 1, these par-
ticipants recorded their driving mishaps
monthly for the next 12 months. Par-
ticipants were compensated $10 for
each month of driving mishap data
they provided.
Results
The distribution of RADD scores from
the Internet-based study 2 had a slightly
lower mean (0.30 vs. 0.34; P , 0.01),
median (0.97 vs. 0.99; P , 0.01), and
maximum (2.50 vs. 2.99; P , 0.01)
than in the face-to-face study 1. These
differences in scores were not related to
sex or age. Using the criterion estab-
lished for HR driving in study 1 (RADD
score $0.339), the percentage of partic-
ipants assigned to the HR category in
study 2 was 35.3%, compared with
37.5% in study 1.
To examine driving mishaps in study
2, negative binomial regression (a model
of count data that controls for overdis-
persion in participant responses [21])
was used to compare the number of
self-reported driving mishaps that oc-
curred prospectively over 12 months
for the HR and LR groups. The post hoc
Tukey test assessed whether significant
differences existed between groups.
The model fit the data (x2 = 239.42;
df = 231; P = 0.338), with group place-
ment as a significant predictor of total
mishaps (likelihood ratio = 21.58; P ,
0.001). As was hypothesized and ob-
served in study 1, participants in the LR
group reported significantly fewer aver-
age mishaps (1.65) than those in the HR
group (4.26; z = 4.82; P , 0.001) (Fig. 1).
The model was then adjusted to control
for age (higher risk being #25 years of
age), sex (higher risk being male), insulin
delivery (higher risk using insulin pump
delivery), and hypoglycemia awareness
(higher risk with reduced awareness on
the measure developed by Clarke et al.
[14]). The controlled model also fit well
(x2 = 239.58; df = 227; P = 0.271), with
group placement as a statistically signifi-
cant predictor of total mishaps (likelihood
ratio = 26.12; P , 0.001). Supporting
hypothesis 2, the mishap rate of the
HR group was 2.83 times higher than
that of the LR group when all other var-
iables were held constant (z = 5.41; P ,
0.001).
In terms of covariates, only age and
hypoglycemia awareness statistically
contributed to the model. Younger driv-
ers (,25 years old; z = 3.186; P = 0.001)
and participants with impaired aware-
ness (z = 2.378; P = 0.017) reported sig-
nificantly more mishaps than older and
hypoglycemia-aware drivers when ac-
counting for all other variables in the
model.
AIM A DISCUSSION
In response to the ADA position state-
ment, a brief psychometric questionnaire
was developed from questionnaire items
in study 1 to empirically identify drivers
with type 1 diabetes who are at elevated
risk of being involved in future driving
mishaps. Consistent with laboratory stud-
ies (6,7) and a multinational survey (2),
the RADD identifies a subset of individu-
als at elevated risk of driving mishaps. The
weights of the logistic regression equa-
tion indicate the relative contribution of
the factors, which are (in order of impor-
tance) peripheral neuropathy (0.74),
drivingexposure(milesdriven;0.58),prob-
lems with hypoglycemia in general (RASH;
0.24), and a history of hypoglycemia-
related driving mishaps (0.08). Factors
in study 1 that did not account for the
unique variance of future driving mis-
haps in this equation were fear of hypo-
glycemia, concerns with hyperglycemia,
other diabetic complications (e.g., retinop-
athy, cardiovascular disease), impaired
hypoglycemia awareness, duration of
disease, vision, sex, and age. Age and im-
paired hypoglycemia awareness were
significant covariates only in study 2.
This does not mean that such factors as
fear of hypoglycemia do not relate to
driving mishaps for an individual driver,

 only that in combination with the other
variables they do not add to the predic-
tive model.
A strength of this 11-item scale is its
brevity. In study 2 we attempted to aug-
ment the RADD by replacing the single
neuropathy item with a neuropathy ques-
tionnaire (Neuropathy-Specific Quality
of Life scale [22]). This did not improve
the sensitivity or specificity of the scale,
so the simpler version of the RADD was
retained.
The RADD is a psychometrically sound
instrument. Using two different samples
and methods of administration, the distri-
butions of RADD scores were similar.
In both samples, the RADD identified
approximately a third of the drivers with
type 1 diabetes as being at elevated risk
of future driving mishaps. The slightly
higher mean, median, and maximum
RADD scores in study 1 may be attributed
to the longer period of recent driving mis-
haps considered (2 years vs. 1 year). More
importantly, using the cutoff criteria from
study 1 on a different sample, obtained
using a different method of administra-
tion, again showed that those identified
as being at HR for future driving mishaps
did, in fact, report significantly more mis-
haps in the subsequent 12 months. This
resulted even when traditional risk fac-
tors of driving mishaps, such as age and
impaired hypoglycemia awareness, were
controlled. Further external validation
comes from the mishap item, “Did you
require assistance from someone else
while driving due to your extreme BG?”
In study 2, participants in the HR group
reported that their passengers inter-
vened 111 times because they perceived
that the driver was impaired. This only
occurred 27 times in the LR group.
A limitation to the routine use of the
RADD in a paper-and-pencil format is its
complicated scoring formula. However,
this barrier can be eliminated by making
the RADD available online, where auto-
matic scoring and confidential feedback
can be provided to users at any time and
location. The ADA will soon make the
RADD freely and publicly available on
their website. Another limitation is
that the RADD was not tested with ad-
olescents, so the above results cannot
be extrapolated to this already HR pop-
ulation. This limitation is significant be-
cause driving safety is a major concern
of parents of novice drivers trying to
negotiate driving challenges and their
diabetes (23). Further, it may be that
the RADD could be made more com-
prehensive by incorporating the disrup-
tive effects of extreme hyperglycemia
(e.g., .250 mg/dL or 13.9 mmol/L),
which has been associated with cogni-
tive symptoms (24), cognitive impair-
ments (23,25,26), and driving mishaps
(9,27).
The RADD had a false-negative rate of
24%, classifying people as LR drivers
when they reported more than one
driving mishap during the subsequent
12 months. This illustrates that any
driver has a risk of being involved in a
collision or receiving a citation, and any
driver with type 1 diabetes has the ad-
ditional risk of experiencing disruptive
extreme BG that can result in a mishap
while driving. While ideally all drivers
with type 1 diabetes should measure
their BG before driving, they should at
least be counseled that whenever they
take more insulin, eat fewer carbohy-
drates, or engage in more physical activ-
ity than usual, they should measure
their BG before driving. If their glucose
is between 70 and 90 mg/dL (3.9 and
5 mmol/L), they should eat carbohy-
drates as a preventive measure. If their
BG is ,70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), they
should eat carbohydrates immediately
and not start driving until their glucose
is above 90 mg/dL (5 mmol/L) and their
cognitive and motor functioning has
normalized (6). Because driving has a
metabolic demand (28,29), drivers
should be further counseled to measure
their glucose periodically during long
drives.
As with any risk profile (such as the
ADA’s Type 2 Diabetes Risk Test [30,31]),
an elevated RADD score does not defin-
itively mean that the driver will have
driving mishaps in the next 12 months.
In fact, study 2 found a 36% false-positive
rate among HR participants receiving
RC. However, a RADD score classified
as HR does mean that the potential
for a diabetes-related mishap should
be considered and that it would be pru-
dent to diminish the risk. This could in-
volve educating patients and assisting
them in taking steps that will allow
them to better anticipate and prevent
hypoglycemia while driving. Efforts
to reduce risk should also involve
better detection and treatment of mild
hypoglycemia (70–55 mg/dL or 3.9–
2.8 mmol/L [32]) while driving in order
to halt progression toward disruptive
hypoglycemia. Aim B was to implement
an intervention program motivated by
these pedagogical principles, focusing
on the HR drivers defined by aim A.
AIM B, STUDY 2: VALIDATE AN
INTERVENTION TO ASSIST HR
INDIVIDUALS IN REDUCING THE
OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE
DRIVING MISHAPS
It was hypothesized that the Internet in-
tervention DiabetesDriving.com (DD
.com), designed to aid drivers in better
anticipating and preventing, detecting,
and treating hypoglycemia while driv-
ing, would 1) lead to fewer future driv-
ing mishaps among HR drivers; 2) reduce
the occurrence of driving mishaps
among HR individuals to the level ob-
served in the LR group, effectively “nor-
malizing” risk of future driving mishaps;
and 3) achieve greater adherence and
efficacy when combined with motiva-
tional interviewing (MI; reported else-
where [33]). Secondary aims were to
determine whether DD.com had an ef-
fect on driving parameters related to the
risk of mishaps.
Methods
Overview
A total of 118 LR and 375 HR drivers
qualified for aim B (see STUDY 2: RADD VALI-
DATION). Using the randomization func-
tion in Microsoft Excel, HR participants
were randomly assigned to one of three
conditions: RC (n = 122; the same par-
ticipants as in the RADD validation
study), DD.com (n = 124), and DD.com +
MI (n = 129). These participants were
compared with the LR participants re-
ceiving RC in study 2, as they relate to
aim A. Figure 2 depicts the study design.
Participants completed baseline ques-
tionnaires online at study day 0. After
completing questionnaires, DD.com par-
ticipants received immediate access to
the intervention, whereas DD.com + MI
participants received access after an MI
session by telephone. Both DD.com
groups had 70 days to complete the in-
tervention, whereas participants in the
RC group continued with RC. At the end
of the 70-day period, all study partici-
pants completed posttreatment assess-
ment questionnaires. All participants
then completed 12 monthly driving dia-
ries online, where they recorded their
driving mishaps and the attributed

 source (hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or
other reasons). After 12 months of re-
cording driving mishaps, participants
completed a final set of assessment
questionnaires (study day 435). Partici-
pants were paid $50 and $100 for com-
pleting assessments at days 70 and 435,
respectively, and $10 for each monthly
driving diary completed.
Assessment Questionnaires
Assessment questionnaires were ad-
ministered three times: on days 0, 70,
and 435. Assessments took approxi-
mately 45 min to complete and con-
sisted of a demographic questionnaire
and questionnaires assessing both atti-
tudes and behaviors related to hypogly-
cemia and to driving (Table 2).
After assessment, DD.com partici-
pants also rated the usefulness of differ-
ent elements of the intervention in
achieving their goal of reducing driving
risk (Supplementary Table 2).
DiabetesDriving.com
DD.com consisted of five units, and the
content of each unit is summarized in
Table 3. An initial “how to use” unit
(unit 0) became available 7 days after
completing the day 0 assessment, and
during this time the study coordinator
mailed participants a “tool kit” (de-
scribed below) for unit 1. Units 1 and
2 became available immediately after
completing the previous unit. Units 3–5
required that participants complete
three homework assignments within a
7-day window before gaining access to
the next unit. Each unit began with a re-
view of the participant’s homework from
the preceding unit.
The tool kit in unit 1 was a clear plastic
case containing 1) a predriving checklist
(similar to a pilot’s preflight checklist)
that focused on considering whether
BG is or may become low during the
drive; 2) glucose sources, both fast-acting
(dextrose tablets) and long-acting
(cheese crackers); 3) a keychain with a
stoplight logo to remind drivers of
BG benchmarks (the green light in-
dicated they could drive right away
[BG .90 mg/dL or 5 mmol/L], yellow in-
dicated caution because BG could go low
during a drive and require prophylactic
carbohydrates [BG between 70 and
90 mg/dL, or 3.9 and 5 mmol/L], and
red indicated they should stop immedi-
ately, eat fast-acting carbohydrates, and
delay
driving
until
BG
recovered
[BG ,70 mg/dL or 3.9 mmol/L]); 4) stop-
light logo stickers to place on the dash-
board or near their car keys; and 5) a
BG meter to encourage self-monitoring
of BG before and during long drives.
Participants were encouraged to keep
the tool kit in the car in a consistent loca-
tion that was easily accessible to the driver
and easily replenished when needed.
At the end of units 2–5, participants
reviewed the unit’s content and se-
lected three homework activities to do
daily over the next week. Homework
aimed to help them become safer
drivers by applying what they had just
learned. Each day, they received an
e-mail message instructing them to log
on to the website in order to record
completed homework assignments and
rate their success at achieving their
homework goals.
If 3 days elapsed without response to
an assigned element of DD.com (e.g., as-
sessments, homework activities, starting
a unit, or completing a monthly driving
diary), participants received an e-mail
message inviting them to log on to the
website to reengage in DD.com. If they
did not respond to the prompt within
3 days, another was sent. If there was
no response in the allotted time period,
these prompts continued at progressively
longer intervals in order to give partici-
pants an opportunity to reengage.
Motivational Interviewing
The goal of the MI sessions was to in-
crease participants’ motivation to com-
plete DD.com and its assignments, thus
maximizing the positive effects of DD
.com on their driving habits. Interviews
were conducted via telephone, were
semistructured, and were partially scrip-
ted to enhance fidelity to MI techniques
and to maximize consistency across
counselors. A description of the MI com-
ponent, its fidelity, and its effect on DD
.com was previously published (33).
Results
Completion Rates
Of those assigned to DD.com or DD
.com + MI, 96.5% completed unit 0,
92.5% completed unit 1, 87.5% com-
pleted unit 2, 68.6% completed unit 3,
52.3% completed unit 4, and 42.2%
completed the entire program in the
70-day treatment period. However, an
additional 28% completed DD.com dur-
ing the 12-month follow-up, resulting in
an overall completion rate of 70%.
Driving Mishaps
Participants from the LR and HR groups
receiving RC, the DD.com group, and the
DD.com + MI group completed 98%,
94%, 77%, and 78% of all monthly driv-
ing diaries, respectively. This was the
primary outcome variable.
Because of the nature of the data
(counts) and to correct for overdisper-
sion among participant responses, neg-
ative binomial regression was used to
analyze monthly driving diary outcomes

 using R statistical software version 3.1.2
(19). No significant differences were
found between the DD.com and DD.com +
MI groups on any outcome variables
(number of units completed, daily prog-
ress notes completed, completion rate
of DD.com, or number of driving mishaps
[33]). Therefore, treatment outcomes
are presented with these participants
collapsed into a single intervention
group, DD.comAll.
Looking first at the total number of
mishaps in the 12-month follow-up pe-
riod, the negative binomial model fit the
data (x2 = 441.19; df = 424; P = 0.272),
with group placement functioning as a
significant predictor of yearly mishaps
(likelihood ratio = 23.08; df = 2; P ,
0.001). The DD.comAll group reported
fewer mishaps than the HR group receiv-
ing RC (z = 2.86; P = 0.01) but reported
1.58 times more mishaps than the LR
group receiving RC (z = 2.59; P = 0.026).
Specifically, DD.com reduced the differ-
ence in mishaps between the HR and
LR groups receiving RC by 63% (Fig. 3,
vertical bars).
Attribution of Driving Mishaps
This analysis examined the number of
mishaps that participants attributed to
hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or other
factors. Figure 3 illustrates that the LR
and HR groups receiving RC, the DD
.com group, and the DD.com + MI group
reported 0.75, 2.95, 1.65, and 1.53
hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps/
year/driver, respectively. The negative
binomial model fit the data for total re-
ported hypoglycemic driving mishaps
(x2 = 364.43; df = 424; P = 0.983), with
group placement as a significant predic-
tor (likelihood ratio = 27.02; df = 2;
P , 0.001).The DD.comAll group reported
fewer mishaps attributed to hypogly-
cemia than the HR group receiving RC
(z = 2.86; P = 0.012) but more than
the LR group receiving RC (z = 3.16;
P = 0.004).
For driving mishaps attributed to
hyperglycemia, the negative bino-
mial model fit the data (x2 = 147.33;
df = 424; P = 1.00). However, group
placement was not a significant predic-
tor. Post hoc tests found no significant
differences between groups in the num-
ber of hyperglycemic driving mishaps
(see Fig. 3).
Psychological and Behavioral Assessments
It was hypothesized that specific diabetes-
related attitudes and behaviors would
differ between HR and LR groups
at baseline, and would improve after
DD.com. These included the manage-
ment of hypoglycemia (RASH), fear of
hypoglycemia (HFS), concerns about hy-
perglycemia (HAS), and general risky driv-
ing behaviors (Cox Assessment of
Risky Driving Scale [CARDS]). It was

 hypothesized that neuropathy-related
quality of life, serving as a control vari-
able, would remain the same or worsen
as a result of the progressive nature of
diabetes.
Supplementary Table 1 displays the
mean group scores on these surveys
for participants who completed all three
assessments. Significant differences
were found between the DD.comAll
and the RC groups at each assessment,
as determined by post hoc Tukey hon-
estly significant difference between-
group tests. In addition, the table
presents Bonferonni-corrected a values
for significant within-group changes
from day 0 assessment to day 70 and
435 assessments. In some analyses,
scores were root-transformed to cor-
rect for excessive skew and/or kurtosis
(see Supplementary Table 1).
The study hypotheses were generally
supported. At baseline, no differences
were found among the HR participants
assigned to DD.comAll or RC. By contrast,
HR drivers reported more problems with
hypoglycemia and driving than LR driv-
ers on all measures at baseline. After
assessment, neuropathy and quality of
life did not improve, whereas scores on
the HFS and the RASH improved for both
HR groups (DD.comAll and RC). However,
improvements in these measures did
not normalize the DD.comAll group to
the level of the LR group receiving RC,
as seen in Supplementary Table 1. The
mean score of the DD.com groups was
significantly higher than that of the LR
group receiving RC. No deterioration
was seen in any of the psychobehavioral
measures from day 70 to day 435 for the
DD.comAll group.
DD.com User Experience
After assessment, participants answered
14 questions concerning their experi-
ences with DD.com. These were rated
on a Likert scale, from 0 (not at all) to
4 (very). Mean item ratings from partici-
pants who did or did not complete DD
.com on time appear in Supplementary
Table 2.
DD.com completers rated all positive
items higher than noncompleters (e.g.,
“How useful was the tool kit?”: 3.53 vs.
2.80, respectively [P , 0.004]; “How easy
was the web program to use?”: 3.37 vs.
3.03, respectively [P = 0.03]). By contrast,
noncompleters rated the two negative
items higher than completers (“I didn’t
have time in my schedule”: 0.67 vs.
1.46, respectively [P = 0.001]; “DD.com
took too long to do”: 0.51 vs. 1.03, re-
spectively [P = 0.001]).
Discussion
The Internet program, DD.com, which
focuses on the anticipation, prevention,
detection, and treatment of hypoglyce-
mia while driving, was effective at re-
ducing hypoglycemia-related driving
mishaps among HR drivers with type 1
diabetes. Beyond its efficacy, an advan-
tage of this intervention is the online
format, which made it immediately
available to participants (regardless of
their geographic location) in the privacy
and convenience of their own homes,
and did not require any clinic visits.
The improvement in hypoglycemia-
related driving mishaps cannot be attrib-
uted to changes in general attitudes and
self-reported behaviors involving driving
and hypoglycemia, as these improved
equally in participants in the DD.comAll
group and the HR group receiving RC.
It is also important to note that DD
.com only affected hypoglycemia-related
driving mishaps, not hyperglycemia- or
non-diabetes-related mishaps. Together,
these data suggest that DD.com had the
specific effect intended: reducing the oc-
currence of hypoglycemia-related driving
mishaps. The results also suggest that the
HR group receiving RC derived some psy-
chological and behavioral benefits from
participating in this study, perhaps by
completing questionnaires that raised
their level of awareness regarding their
own driving risk.
Like the Diabetes Control and Complica-
tions Trial (DCCT), which relied on partici-
pant self-report of severe hypoglycemia
(34), this randomized clinical trial relied
onself-reportofdrivingmishapsandcausal
attributions. Concern about participant re-
sponse bias is lessened by the fact that
HR participants receiving RC reported a
higher incidence of driving mishaps than
LR participants receiving RC, and that all
groups reported a similar number of
hyperglycemia- and non-diabetes-related
driving mishaps. It may be that individu-
als who devoted the time and effort to
complete this program had a differential
bias in not reporting driving mishaps. This
seems unlikely, however, given that the
number of driving mishaps in the two
DD.com groups was similar, whereas the
number of mishaps reported in the two
RC groups differed.
Other methodological limitations ex-
ist, which should be noted. 1) This de-
sign did not allow us to determine
whether a simpler, shorter intervention
could have been as effective as this five-
unit program. It may be that just giving
HR drivers the tool kit and simple in-
structions concerning how to anticipate,
prevent, detect, and treat hypoglyce-
mia would have yielded similar re-
sults. 2) Because we did not test DD
.com with LR or intermediate-risk driv-
ers, we cannot determine the effect of
the intervention on those samples of
drivers. 3) Because DD.comAll partici-
pants attributed 25% of their driving
mishaps to hyperglycemia, this inter-
vention could possibly be enhanced by
also focusing on anticipating, prevent-
ing, detecting, and treating driving-
related hyperglycemia. 4) Given that the
participant sample was recruited via the
Internet, results from this selective sam-
ple may not generalize to all drivers with
type 1 diabetes. 5) An additional limita-
tion is that only 70% of the participants
eventually completed the intervention,
regardless of whether they received
MIs. This is unlikely to be a consequence
of the online study format, since both RC
groups had a higher rate of monthly diary
completion (96%) than either of the in-
tervention groups. Noteworthy is that
the highest dropout rate coincided
with the completion of unit 3, in which
there was the highest demand for
“homework” activities (i.e., extensive
reporting of driving diary activities).
Nonetheless, in this large-scale, national,
randomized trial with a 12-month follow-
up, DD.com significantly reduced the
risk of future driving mishaps among
HR drivers with type 1 diabetes. This
demonstrates that driving risk can be
reduced in those drivers who are more
vulnerable to hypoglycemia-related
driving mishaps.
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS
This series of studies demonstrates that
some drivers with type 1 diabetes are
at greater risk of driving mishaps. These
HR drivers can be identified using the
RADD, a brief, psychometrically sound
questionnaire that the ADA will soon
host on their website. Finally, the inci-
dence of future driving mishaps
among HR drivers can be reduced via
