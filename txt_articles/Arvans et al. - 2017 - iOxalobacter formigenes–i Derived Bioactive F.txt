ABSTRACT
Hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for kidney stones and has no specific therapy, although Oxalobacter formi-
genes colonization is associated with reduced stone risk. O. formigenes interacts with colonic epithelium and
inducescolonicoxalatesecretion,therebyreducingurinaryoxalateexcretion,viaanunknownsecretagogue.The
difficulties in sustaining O. formigenes colonization underscore the need to identify the derived factors inducing
colonicoxalatesecretion.WethereforeevaluatedtheeffectsofO.formigenescultureconditionedmedium(CM)
on apical 14C-oxalate uptake by human intestinal Caco-2-BBE cells. Compared with control medium, O. formi-
genes CM significantly stimulated oxalate uptake (.2.4-fold), whereas CM from Lactobacillus acidophilus did
not. Treating the O. formigenes CM with heat or pepsin completely abolished this bioactivity, and selective
ultrafiltration of the CM revealed that the O. formigenes–derived factors have molecular masses of 10–30 kDa.
Treatment with the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 or the anion exchange inhibitor 4,4’-diisothiocyano-2,2’-
stilbenedisulfonic acid completely blocked the CM-induced oxalate transport. Knockdown of the oxalate
transporter SLC26A6 also significantly restricted the induction of oxalate transport by CM. In a mouse model
of primary hyperoxaluria type 1, rectal administration of O. formigenes CM significantly reduced (.32.5%)
urinary oxalate excretion and stimulated (.42%) distal colonic oxalate secretion. We conclude that
O. formigenes–derived bioactive factors stimulate oxalate transport in intestinal cells through mechanisms
including PKA activation. The reduction in urinary oxalate excretion in hyperoxaluric mice treated with
O. formigenes CMreflectstheinvivoretentionofbiologicactivityandthetherapeuticpotentialofthesefactors.

Nephrolithiasis is the second most prevalent kidney
disease in the United States after hypertension,
with a rising prevalence and complications includ-
ing CKD and ESRD.1 Hyperoxaluria is a major risk
factor for kidney stones, and 70%–80% of kidney
stones are composed of calcium oxalate.2 Urinary
oxalate is an important determinant of supersatu-
ration, and the risk of stone formation is affected by
small increases in urine oxalate.3,4 Mild-to-moderate
hyperoxaluria is found in patients with diabetes and
obesity and contributes to their increased risk of
stone formation.5–9 More severe hyperoxaluria is
seen in enteric hyperoxaluria (EH), most commonly
observed in inflammatory bowel disease patients and
after small-bowel resection and bariatric surgery for
obesity.10–12 Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is an in-
herited disease in which there is endogenous oxalate

 overproduction.13 Both EH and PH lead to recurrent calcium
oxalate kidney stones (COKS), nephrocalcinosis, and ESRD.
The mammalian intestine plays a crucial role in oxalate
homeostasis, by regulating the amount of absorbed dietary
oxalateand providinganavenueforentericoxalateexcretion.14
Anion exchanger SLC26A6 (A6)-mediated intestinal oxalate secre-
tion plays a critical role in preventing hyperoxaluria and
COKS.15,16 Oxalobacter formigenes is an anaerobic bacterium
and utilizes oxalate as its exclusive energy source.17 O. formigenes
colonization correlates with reduced risk of COKS formation
in a number of studies, presumably by reducing intestinal
oxalate absorption and urinary oxalate excretion.18–21
In addition to degrading dietary oxalate, O. formigenes also
interacts with colonic epithelium by inducing distal colonic
oxalate secretion, leading to reduced urinary excretion via a
potential secretagogue.22 This effect was demonstrated in ro-
dent colon and whether similar regulation is also active in
human colon remains to be determined. O. formigenes colo-
nization of PH1 mice significantly reduced serum and urinary
oxalate levels due to induction of colonic oxalate secretion.23
However, all PH1 mice lost colonization within 18 days when
switched from a high oxalate/low calcium diet (1.5% oxalate/
0.5% calcium) to regular mouse chow (0.25% oxalate/1%
calcium).23 In addition, colonization cannot be maintained
without reducing dietary calcium.22,24 Moreover, it has been
suggested from studies in PH patients and PH1 mice that the
intraluminal environment in PH is not supportive of sustained
O. formigenes colonization.23,25 Collectively, maintaining
O. formigenes colonization in the absence of high exogenous
oxalate remains problematic, underscoring the need for iden-
tifying O. formigenes–derived bioactive factors exerting effects
similar to live O. formigenes.
We therefore examined whether O. formigenes conditioned
medium (CM) modulates intestinal oxalate transport by test-
ing its effects on oxalate uptake by Caco2-BBE (C2) cells. We
find that O. formigenes CM significantly stimulates oxalate
uptake by C2 cells through PKA activation. small interfering
RNA (siRNA) knockdown studies show that a significant
component of the observed stimulation is A6-mediated. Im-
portantly, O. formigenes CM also significantly reduces urinary
oxalate excretion in PH1 mice by stimulating distal colonic
oxalate secretion, reflecting its translational relevance. Of note
is that A6 (mediates $50% of apical oxalate uptake by C2
cells26) operates in the direction of exchanging intracellular
oxalate for mucosal Cl during the process of transepithelial
intestinal oxalate secretion. However, A6 can operate in either
direction,27 and we therefore measured its activity by the more
convenient assay of cellular oxalate uptake.
RESULTS
We previously established C2 cells as a model to study regula-
tion of intestinal oxalate transport by extracellular nucleo-
tides.28 We have now used C2 cells to examine whether
intestinal oxalate transport is regulated by O. formigenes CM.
As shown in Figure 1A, compared with untreated (UT) cells
and cells treated with O. formigenes growth medium (OM), the
CM significantly stimulated (.2.4-fold) oxalate uptake. Sim-
ilar effects were also observed with 6-hour and 16-hour incu-
bations, but no effect was seen at 1 hour (data not shown). The
pH of the medium is not affected by OM or CM. Importantly,
OM or CM has no effect on the transepithelial resistance (TER)
(mean TER in V cm2, before and after treatment, respectively:
UT=434.17619.49 and 443.83620.09; OM=417.4567.24 and
430.11611.74; CM=436.25611.26 and 438.57613.10), indi-
cating that OM or CM did not affect the paracellular perme-
ability. These results indicate that potential secreted factors are
responsible for the observed stimulation, likely by modulating
the activity of the involved transporter(s).
A crucial question is, how specific is the observed stimu-
lation? To address specificity, we similarly evaluated the effect
of Lactobacillus acidophilus (also degrades intraluminal oxa-
late,29 but it is unknown if it interacts with intestinal cells and
modulates oxalate transport) CM. Compared with UT and
cells treated with the control medium (MRS), L. acidophilus
CM had no effect on oxalate uptake by C2 cells (Figure 1B).
These results indicate that O. formigenes CM-mediated stim-
ulation of oxalate transport is specific and is possibly mediated
by one or more O. formigenes–derived factor(s).
To ensure that the CMeffects on intestinal oxalate transport
are notcell-linespecific, weevaluatedthe CMeffects onoxalate
uptake by the human colonic cell line T84. C2 and T84 cells are
considered models for absorptive epithelial cells and secretory
crypt cells, respectively. We previously demonstrated that A6
mediates most of oxalate transport in T84 cells.30 Compared
with UTand OM, the CM significantly stimulated (.2.6-fold)
oxalate uptake by T84 cells (Figure 2). These results indicate
that the CM effects on oxalate transport by intestinal epithelial
cells are not cell-line specific.
To test the possibility that the O. formigenes–derived bio-
active factor(s) might be proteinaceous in nature, the CM was
subjected to heat treatment. Compared with UT, the CM sig-
nificantly stimulated (.1.9-fold) oxalate uptake by C2, an
effect completely abolished by heat treatment (heated CM)
(Figure 3A). These results indicate that the O. formigenes–
derived factor(s) is/are likely to be protein(s) and/or peptide(s).
To provide more evidence that the O. formigenes–derived bio-
active factor(s) is/are protein(s) and/or peptide(s), the CM
was treated with the protease pepsin. Compared with UT,
the CM significantly stimulated (.4-fold) oxalate uptake by C2,
an effect completely abolished by pepsin treatment (CM+
Pepsin) (Figure 3B). Treatment of the CM with another pro-
tease, trypsin, also completely abolished its bioactivity (data
not shown). These results provide further evidence that the
O.formigenes–derivedfactor(s)is/areprotein(s)and/or peptide(s).
To determine themolecular mass(es) (MM)ofthefactor(s),

CM, filtrate (F), retentate (R), or F+R. Using a 10 kDa column,

 theRandtheF+R significantlystimulatedoxalate uptakebyC2
cells, whereas the F had no effect (Figure 4A). Using a 30 kDa
column, the F and the F+R significantly stimulated oxalate
uptake by C2 cells, whereas the R had no effect (Figure 4B).
Collectively, these results indicate that the MMs of the factors
are largely between 10 and 30 kDa. Because F+R had a better
stimulatory effect than F, whereas R had no effect, such data
suggest the possibility that these factors might exist as a mul-
tifunctional complex requiring a bacterial product of .30 kDa
for optimal functioning.
O. formigenes was suggested to utilize a potential secreta-
gogue as a survival strategy when dietary oxalate is limited.22
To test the hypothesis that lower growth medium oxalate con-
centration might lead to more secreted factor(s) and therefore
to a CM with higher bioactivity, oxalate concentration was
reduced from 37.5 mM to 18.8 and 9.4 mM, and conditioned
media under these conditions were simul-
taneously prepared (CM37.5, CM18.8, and
CM9.4, respectively). C2 cells were UT or
treated with CM37.5, CM18.4, and CM9.4.
Interestingly, the bioactivity of the CM was
significantly higher (.2-fold) with CM9.4
compared with CM37.5 (Figure 5). These
results strongly indicate that the secretion
of these factors is inducible, which will sig-
nificantly facilitate their characterization.
Probiotic-derived factors regulate intes-
tinal epithelial homeostasis by modulating
specific signaling pathways.31,32 To eluci-
date the involved signaling pathway(s), we
tested the effects of several pharmacologic
inhibitors. Preincubation of C2 cells with
the PKA inhibitor H8933 before incubation
with the CM (CM+H89) completely blocked
the CM-induced stimulation, whereas it had
no effect on baseline transport (H89) (Figure
6). We previously found PKC activation inhibits intestinal oxalate
transport through a Gö6983-sensitive pathway28,30,34; how-
ever, this inhibitor had no effect on the observed stimulation
(pmol/cm2 per minute: UT=3.1260.32; CM=10.5460.43;
CM+Gö6983=9.6460.67; Gö6983=3.6060.77). On the
other hand, Gö6976, U0126, SB 202190, LY 294002, genistein,
and PP2 (described in the Concise Methods) had no signifi-
cant effect on the observed stimulation (data not shown).
Taken together, these results indicate that the CM stimulates
oxalate transport in C2 cells by activating PKA, whereas PKC,
MAPKs, and Src kinases are unlikely to be involved.
ToassesswhethertheCM-inducedstimulationofoxalateuptake
by C2 cells is due to an active transcellular transport process, the
effects of the anion exchange inhibitor 4,4׳diisothiocyanostilbene-
2,2׳-disulfonic acid (DIDS) were tested on the observed stimu-
lation. Compared with UT cells, the CM significantly stimulated
(.3.4-fold) oxalate uptake by C2, an effect completely abolished
by DIDS (100 mM) treatment (CM+DIDS) (Figure 7). These
results indicate that the observed stimulation is mediated by
DIDS-sensitive transporters such as A6 and/or SLC26A2
(A2).26,30,35,36
To examine whether the CM stimulates oxalate transport in C2
cells by increasing the mRNA expression of the likely involved
transporters (SLC26A1 [A1], A2, and/or A6), C2 cells were UTor
similarly treated with the CM and then total RNA was isolated for
qPCR analysis. Compared with UT, the CM did not significantly
affect A1, 2, and 6 mRNA expression (Figure 8), indicating that the
observed stimulation is unlikely to be through modulation of these
transporters at a transcriptional level. In addition, the CM did not
significantly affect A6 total and surface protein expression assessed
by immunoblotting and surface biotinylation (Supplemental Fig-
ure 1). However, because of a lack of good antibodies, we did not
testtheCMeffectsonA1orA2totalandsurfaceproteinexpression.
To examine whether the CM affects oxalate transport kinetic
characteristics (i.e., the apparent affinity for oxalate [km] and

 maximal velocity [Vmax)]), 14C-oxalate uptake as a function of
increasing 14C-oxalate concentration in the flux medium (0.3, 1,
3, 10, 20, 75, 150, and 225 mM) was assessed. Compared with
UT cells, the CM significantly stimulated (.2.3-fold) oxalate
uptake (which is saturable in the presence of increasing oxalate
concentrations, reflecting a carrier-mediated transport pro-
cess) at each concentration (Figure 9). Analysis of these results
with a nonlinear regression Michaelis–Menten fit yielded a
Km of 67.79615.47 and 19.6763.64 mM
and a Vmax of 12.6361.04 and 25.786
1.21 pmol/cm2 per minute for UT and
CM, respectively. These data indicate that
the observed stimulation is due to CM-
induced increase (.2-fold) in Vmax (i.e.,
greater transport capacity) and reduction
(.3.4-fold) in Km (i.e., greater affinity for
oxalate) of the involved transporter(s).
To investigate the A6 role in the observed
stimulation, A6 expression in C2 cells
was knocked down using siRNA. C2 cells
were untransfected or transfected with a
negative control siRNA (NC si) or an A6
specific siRNA (A6 si). A6 si significantly
reduced A6 protein expression (approxi-
mately 61%) and baseline oxalate uptake
(approximately 49%) by C2 cells (Figure
10), results which were similar to those pre-
viously reported,26 whereas NC si had no
effect, indicating the observed reduction
in A6 expression is not due to a general ef-
fect of the silencing procedure. Equal loading was verified by
observing no difference in GAPDH. Silencing A6 greatly de-
creased the CM-induced stimulation of oxalate transport by
C2 cells (Figure 10C), indicating that a significant component
of the observed stimulation is mediated by A6.
Although C2 cells closely resemble the native epithelium,
confirmation of the in vitro findings in vivo is of paramount
physiologic and translational interest. To this end, we evalu-
ated the CM effects on the hyperoxaluria
observed in PH1 mice.37 We first con-
firmed that these mice have significant
(.3.6-fold) hyperoxaluria compared with
their controls (C57BL/6J) (mM/mM creati-
nine: controls=0.1660.01; PH1=0.576
0.03; n=6–10). PH1 mice (males; 38–42
weeks old) were given CM or OM (100 ml
twice daily as rectal enemas 3 21 days) and
urine was collected before (Before Rx) and
after treatment (After Rx) for oxalate mea-
surements. Importantly, the CM signifi-
cantly reduced (.32.5%) urinary oxalate
excretion, whereas OM had no effect (Fig-
ure 11). These results indicate that the
O. formigenes–derived factors retain their
biologic activity in vivo and effectively lower
urinary oxalate excretion. Of note is that
distal colonic histology from OM - and
CM-treated mice (compared with UT
mice) looks normal, with no evidence of
injury, irritation, or inflammation (Supple-
mental Figure 2).
To test the possibility that the observed
reduction in urinary oxalate excretion is

 due to CM-induced colonic oxalate secretion, distal colonic
tissues from CM- and OM-treated PH1 mice were isolated and
mounted in Ussing chambers at the end of treatment.
Although a small net oxalate secretory flux (24.7162.44) is
observed in distal colonic tissues from OM-treated PH1
mice, a .4.2-fold higher net oxalate secretory flux
(220.0165.51) is seen in distal colonic tissues from CM-
treated PH1 mice, which is due to significantly increased
(.42%) secretory flux (JSM) (Table 1). CM or OM had no
significant effect on the absorptive flux. These results indicate
that the O. formigenes–derived factors reduce urinary oxalate
excretion in PH1 mice through mechanisms including en-
hanced net distal colonic oxalate secretion. Although the
transepithelial conductance is not affected, the CM signifi-
cantly increased the short-circuit current (Table 1), suggesting
that the CM also affects the movement of other ion(s), as
observed with O. formigenes colonization of PH1 mice in
some series, and rats treated with O. formigenes lysate.22,23
The latter was explained by concomitant induction of net
chloride secretion, which could potentially stimulate transe-
pithelial colonic oxalate secretion by providing a counter-ion
gradient for exchanging intracellular oxalate for mucosal Cl.
DISCUSSION
Probiotic bacteria have several health benefits; however, difficul-
ties in determining intestinal bacterial bioavailability and bio-
safety concerns when administering live probiotics are potential
problems facing current probiotics clinical application. Devel-
oping probiotics-derived factors as novel therapeutic agents is
an alternative approach to address such concerns. Secreted
factors from many probiotics stimulate several intestinal
epithelial cell protective responses by activating different
protein kinases.31,32,38–41 We now find that O. formigenes–
derived factors significantly stimulate oxalate transport in
C2 cells through a PKA-dependent signaling pathway. These
factors retain their biologic activity in vivo and significantly
reduce urinary oxalate excretion in PH1 mice by stimulating
distal colonic oxalate secretion.
Hatch et al. reported that O. formigenes interacts with colonic
epithelium by inducing distal colonic oxalate secretion, leading
to reduced urinary excretion via a potential secretagogue.22 They
also tested O. formigenes whole cells, cell membranes, and lysates
on oxalate transport across rat distal colonic tissues mounted in
Ussing chambers, and found no effect. Also, the effects of these
products were tested for 45 minutes, which might be too short
in view of the reported longer incubations (2–24 hours) for
other probiotics,32,42 and the fact that the CM had no effect
with 1 hour incubation. Feeding hyperoxaluricrats encapsulated
O. formigenes lysate for 5 days significantly induced distal colonic
oxalate secretion and reduced urinary oxalate excretion,22 which
supports this assumption. In addition, the whole cells and lysates
significantly degraded oxalate in the chamber, necessitating
heat treatment of samples to eradicate this degradative ef-
fect.22 The authors acknowledged that such heat treatment
might have destroyed any potential O. formigenes–derived
factor(s), and our finding that heated CM lost its bioactivity
supports this possibility.

 oxalate level(s). Dietary oxalate restriction is ineffective in PH,
and is only of modest benefit in EH. The risk of recurrent
COKS, nephrocalcinosis, oxalate nephropathy, ESRD, and sys-
temic oxalosis remains substantial in the absence of treatment.
In those PH patients unresponsive to pyridoxine, liver trans-
plantation is the only effective treatment.13 Cardiovascular
diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
ESRD patients,44 and a recent report raised the possibility that
the ESRD-associated hyperoxalemia might contribute to this
increased risk.43 Lowering serum oxalate might improve
cardiovascular outcomes in ESRD patients if these findings
are confirmed. The difficulties in maintaining O. formigenes
colonization and biosafety concerns with administering live
probiotics necessitate the identification of the O. formigenes–
derived factors. The fact that these factors are active in vivo
provides compelling evidence to pursue their characteriza-
tion, given their significant therapeutic potential. In addition,
the observation that the secretion of these factors is inducible
by lowering O. formigenes culture mediumoxalate concentration
will significantly facilitate their characterization. Of interest in
this regard is that we identified several interesting O. formigenes
secreted proteins by mass spectrometry, and the most promising
candidates will be overexpressed in Escherichia coli to obtain the
corresponding recombinant proteins in future studies. If this
approach fails to identify the O. formigenes–derived bioactive
factor(s), then an alternative future strategy will be to look at
the O. formigenes transcriptome under low and high oxalate
concentrations in the culture medium.
A6 plays a critical role in mouse duodenal and ileal oxalate
secretion.15,16 A6 is also expressed apically in mouse colon,45 but
its role in colonic oxalate transport remains unknown. Knock-
down studies showed a significant component of the observed
stimulation is A6-mediated. An increase in Vmax indicates
greater transport capacity, which could result from more
membrane transporters. However, because the CM did not
affect A6 surface protein expression, and in view of the re-
duced Km (reflecting greater A6 affinity for oxalate), it is likely
possible that the observed stimulation is due to mechanisms
including CM-induced enhanced A6 transport activity (re-
sulting from an increase in the intrinsic activity of the preex-
isting A6 membrane transporters). A2 is apically expressed in
enterocytes (colon . small intestine).46–48 It mediates oxalate
transport when expressed in heterologous systems and it is
DIDS-sensitive35; however, its role in intestinal oxalate trans-
port is unknown. The observed changes in Km and Vmax could
also result from CM-mediated increased A2 transport activity.
Although A2 mRNA expression is not affected, it is possible
that the observed stimulation is due to CM-induced enhanced
A2 total and/or surface protein expression, which will be
tested in future studies. Because transcellular oxalate secre-
tion requires oxalate influx into the enterocyte from the blood
side, where A1 might be involved, and then its efflux from the
luminal side, it is possible that CM-induced changes in A1
expression and/or activity also contribute to the observed
enhanced distal colonic oxalate secretion.
SLC26A3 (A3) plays a critical role in transcellular mouse
colonic oxalate absorption.49 However, its role in oxalate
transport in C2 cells remains to be determined. Worthy of
mentioning is that in contrast to the observed robust Cl-
HCO3 exchange, human A3 transports oxalate poorly (both
uptake and efflux, despite using a very high 14C-oxalate con-
centration of 1 mM) when expressed in Xenopus oocytes,50
strongly suggesting that Cl-HCO3 exchange is the main phys-
iologic function of A3. In addition, A3-mediated Cl/OH ex-
change activity has been assessed as DIDS-sensitive (using 600
mM DIDS) 36Cl uptake by C2 cells,42,51 reflecting it is relatively
DIDS-insensitive. It should be noted that A3 was proposed to

 serve as a DIDS-sensitive SO4/HCO3 exchanger, while it si-
multaneously operates as the DIDS-resistant Cl/HCO3 ex-
changer.52 At 0.5 mM, DIDS only weakly inhibited A3 activity
(assessed as 36Cl efflux in A3 expressing Xenopus oocytes) in
buffers containing .100 mM Cl,50,53 whereas 1 mM DIDS
almost completely inhibited A3-mediated 36Cl uptake by A3
expressing Xenopus oocytes in buffers containing 1 mM Cl.54
On the basis of these observations, Whittamore et al. suggested
that the observed differential sensitivity of A3-mediated Cl
absorption and SO4 secretion to DIDS (0.5 mM) may be
due to the extracellular concentrations of Cl (122 mM) and
SO4 (0.5 mM), and that A3 may be sensitive to DIDS in the
absence of Cl.52 Of note is that studies with the anion ex-
changer AE1 suggest that extracellular Cl allosterically lowers
DIDS affinity for AE1.55 However, 36Cl uptake by A3 express-
ing HEK cells was found to be insensitive to 1 mM DIDS in Cl-
free buffers.56 Therefore, the issue of A3 being DIDS-sensitive
in Cl-free buffers is not yet resolved. In addition, it remains
to be determined whether lower DIDS concentrations (e.g.,
100 mM, which completely abolished the CM-induced stim-
ulation by C2 cells) would have a similar effect as that ob-
served with 0.5 mM DIDS (which could still reflect relative
DIDS-insensitivity). Moreover, what was observed ex vivo in
native mouse epithelium52 might not be operative in vitro in a
human cell line like C2 cells. Importantly, we also observed
that 100 mM DIDS in buffers containing .120 mM Cl also
completely abolished the CM-induced stimulation by C2 cells
(data not shown). Collectively, in the absence of clear data di-
rectly showing that A3 contributes to DIDS-sensitive oxalate
transport in C2 cells, the previously reported L. acidophilus
CM-induced increase in A3 activity42,51 should not necessarily
result in enhanced oxalate uptake by C2 cells in Cl-free buffers as
seeninFigure 1B.Furthermore, CM-mediatedstimulation ofA3
activity in native epithelium is expected to enhance transcellular
colonic oxalate absorption, leading to increased urinary oxalate
excretion. However, the CM has no effect on distal colonic ox-
alate absorption, as well as it significantly reduced urinary oxa-
late excretion in PH1 mice. Taken together, these observations

 strongly argue against an important role for A3 in the CM-
induced stimulation of oxalate transport in C2 cells (which is
very DIDS-sensitive) and native colonic epithelium. Of note is
that the CM did not affect A3 mRNA level (data not shown).
Our finding that O. formigenes CM stimulates 14C-oxalate
uptake by C2 cells through a PKA-dependent pathway fit with
previous studies demonstrating cAMP stimulates oxalate se-
cretion in rabbit proximal and distal colonic tissues.57,58 In
view of these findings and because C2 cells closely resemble
the native epithelium,59,60 we anticipate that the observed
CM-induced stimulation of mouse distal colonic secretion
might potentially be PKA-mediated in vivo. Of interest in
this regard is that A1 and A2 are predicted to have highly
conserved PKA phosphorylation sites (S467 and S693, respec-
tively), raising their functional significance and potential in-
volvement in PKA regulation of these transporters. However,
A6 is not predicted to have a PKA phosphorylation site. In-
direct PKA regulation of A6 is possible through its interaction
with CFTR. CFTR stimulates A3 and A6 functions in cultured
pancreatic duct cells.61 PKA-dependent phosphorylation of
CFTR domain promotes its binding to SLC26 exchanger do-
main, resulting in significant mutual activation of CFTR and
the SLC26 exchanger.62,63 Therefore, A6 might be involved in
the observed CM-induced stimulation through mechanisms
including PKA-dependent CFTR activation. We don’t know
whether the O. formigenes–derived secretagogue directly
modulates the activity of the involved transporter(s) or
acts indirectly through other regulatory/accessory proteins,
which might involve translational, post-translational, and/
or other genomic changes. Future mechanistic studies will
explore these possibilities, which will help explain why the
CM requires .1 hour to stimulate oxalate transport in C2
cells. Worthy of mentioning is that we previously found
that PKC activation (including cholinergic and purinergic
signaling acting through PKC) negatively regulate A6-
mediated oxalate transport in intestinal cells through a
Gö6983-sensitive pathway.28,30,34 However, Gö6983 has no
effect on the observed stimulation, which is expected be-
cause the CM is stimulating rather than inhibiting oxalate
transport.
In summary, we have shown that O. formigenes CM signif-
icantly stimulates oxalate transport in C2 cells through mech-
anisms including PKA activation, with A6 being responsible
for a significant component of the observed stimulation. The
CM also significantly reduces urinary oxalate excretion in
PH1 mice by stimulating distal colonic oxalate secretion.
Given the significant potential for clinical application of the
O. formigenes–derived bioactive factors as novel therapeutic
agents for prevention and/or treatment of hyperoxaluria, hy-
peroxalemia, and related COKS, characterization of these fac-
tors is currently under active investigation.
CONCISE METHODS
Cell Culture
Human intestinal C2 and T84 cells were grown and maintained
(including monitoring the TER) as we reported previously.28,30 The
oxalate flux and other studies described above were performed using
confluent cells grown for 5–14 days postplating on 0.4 mm collagen-
coated polystyrene transwell membrane filters (Corning, Corning,
NY) in 12 mm inserts. The cells were switched from a DMEM-
containing 8%–10% FBS to a DMEM with 0.1% FBS, and then
incubated for 1 hour before treatment with the specified reagents
(e.g., OM, CM, etc.) in the same 0.1% FBS medium.
Bacterial Cultivation and Preparation
of Conditioned Media
O. formigenes was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (35274; Manassas,
VA) and grown under a 95% CO2, 5% H2 at-
mosphere at 37°C in Oxalobacter medium64
with varying concentrations of sodium oxalate
(1 g/L=9.4 mM; 2.5 g/L=18.8 mM; and the stan-
dard 5 g/L=37.5 mM). Cultivation medium was
dispensed in 50 ml aliquots per 250 ml anaerobic
bottles in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratories,
Grass Lake, MI). After autoclaving, a solution of

twice daily as rectal enemas 3 21 days; n=6–8) and urine was
collected before (Before Rx) and after treatment (After Rx) for
oxalate measurements. The CM significantly reduced urinary
oxalate (adjusted for urinary creatinine [Cr]) excretion (*P,0.03
for CM compared with OM, by unpaired t test).

incubation for one set and after an 18 hour incubation for the second set
(OD at 600 nm of 0.03, 0.075, and 0.150, respective to sodium oxalate
concentration). O. formigenes cultures were centrifuged (3000 3 g at 4°C
for 10 minutes) and the supernatant (CM) was filtered througha 0.22 mm
filter tosterilizeandremoveallbacterialcellsandstoredat280°C.Ofnote
is that we found CM9.4 (harvested at 12 hours from cultures containing
1g/L of sodium oxalate) had the highest bioactivity compared with
CM18.8 or CM37.5 harvested at 12 or 18 hours (Figure 5). Therefore,
most of the studies were done using CM9.4. Earlier in the study, we had
used CM37.5 harvested at 12 hours before comparing the three different
oxalate concentrations described above.
For the studies with heated CM, the CM was subjected to heat
treatment (boiling at 100°C for 20–30 minutes) in a thermoregulatory
water bath and then allowed to cool to room temperature before use.
For the studies with protease-treated CM, the CM was digested
with pepsin. Because pepsin is active at acidic pH, the CM was first
made slightly acidic by titrating with concentrated HCl to a pH of 4
before adding pepsin. The CM was incubated with pepsin (0.4% final
concentration) at 37°C for 60 minutes, and then pepsin was irrevers-
ibly inactivated by altering the pH to 8.0 with concentrated NaOH
and incubation for 10 minutes. Alternatively, after the 60 minute
incubation, pepsin (MM=34.7 kDa) was removed by subjecting the
pepsin-treated CM to sizing filtration using a 30 kDa cutoff spin
column. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 before experimental use. Of
note is that pepsin treatment completely abolished the CM bioactivity
under both conditions (i.e., pepsin inactivation by pH 8.0 or pepsin
removal by sizing filtration).
Todeterminethemolecular weight(s)oftheO.formigenes–derived
secreted bioactive factor(s) present in the CM, the CM was subjected
to selective ultrafiltration using 10 and 30 kDa molecular mass
cutoff spin columns (Ultracel YM-10 and YM-30 membranes;
EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), per manufacturer’s protocols.
The CM samples were spun until 10%–15% of the overall volume
was retained upon concentration. These concentrated fractions
were then used in the experiments and referred to as the filtrate (F;
containing molecules ,10 or 30 kDa) and the retentate (R; contain-
ing molecules .10 or 30 kDa).
L. acidophilus was obtained from ATCC (4357) and grown as pre-
viously reported.51 Briefly, L. acidophilus was grown overnight in
MRS broth at 37°C in a 5% CO2, 95% O2 incubator. L. acidophilus
CM was similarly prepared as described with O. formigenes CM.
Radioactive Flux Studies
Apical 14C-oxalate flux studies in C2 and T84 cells were performed
following our previously published methods.28,30 Briefly, an outward
Cl gradient is imposed by removing extracellular Cl (Cli.Clo, by
incubating in a Cl-free solution containing 20 mM 14C-oxalate for 6
minutes) and the influx of 14C-oxalate in exchange for intracellular Cl
(i.e., apical Cl-oxalate exchange activity, which we previously found
to be inhibited [.91%] by 100 mM luminal DIDS [anion exchange
inhibitor]28) is measured. The influx of 14C-oxalate was terminated
by two to three rapid washes of the cell monolayers with ice-cold Cl-
free solution and the transwells were then placed upside down and
were allowed to dry for several minutes. Membrane filters containing
the cells were cut from the support and placed into vials with scin-
tillation fluid (Opti-Fluor, Packard), and the radioactivity was mea-
sured by scintillation spectrometry after overnight solubilization.
Animals
A mouse model of PH type 1 (called PH1 mice in this study), due to
deficiency in liver alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase,37 was kindly
provided by Dr. Roy-Chowdhury (Albert Einstein College of Medi-
cine). PH1 mice exhibit hyperoxalemia and hyperoxaluria.37 Mice
were bred and maintained in an specific pathogen free facility, with
free access to water and standard mouse chow. All animal studies
were approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with
the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.
Rectal Administration of O. formigenes OM or CM
O. formigenes OM or CM was administered to PH1 mice as rectal
enemas (100 ml twice daily 3 21 days) using disposable animal feed-
ing needles (catalog no. 01–208–87; Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
The needles were introduced approximately 2 cm from the anus, and
the mice were then held from their tails with the heads down and kept
in that position for approximately 1 minute. This protocol was de-
veloped in pilot studies, where CM or OM was given to PH1 mice for
up to 28 days, and the CM was found to significantly reduce urine
oxalate excretion, whereas OM had no effect.
Urine Collection and Oxalate Measurements
Mice were placed individually in well ventilated boxes containing
sterile 96-well plates (in which the urine get collected) and baseline
urine samples were collected over 1 hour. This method was approved
by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Urine samples
from the OM- and CM-treated PH1 mice were directly collected from
the bladders at the end of treatment. The urine samples were acidified
with 4N HCL (50 ml per ml of urine) and stored at 280°C. Urine
oxalate was measured enzymatically using oxalate oxidase (Trinity
Biotech, Bray, Ireland), employing sodium nitrite65 to prevent inter-
ference by ascorbic acid. Oxalate measurements in OM and CM were
performed by ion chromatography. Urine creatinine was measured
by a modified Jaffe alkaline picrate method.
Measurement of Oxalate Fluxes across Distal Colon
Tissues
Immediately after euthanasia, distal colonic tissues were removed,
opened longitudinally along the mesenteric border, thoroughly
cleansed by flushing with ice-cold saline, and then mounted (one

(Physiologic Instruments, SanDiego,CA) (exposed tissuesurfacearea

and direction of the net flux (Jnet) across conductance-matched

 tissues was determined by calculating the difference between the two
measured unidirectional fluxes. The mucosal and serosal surfaces of
thetissuewere bathed with 4mlof warmed(37°C)Ringer buffer(140mM

mucosal or serosal side, respectively. Two micromolar 14C-oxalate
was added either to the mucosal or the serosal bath, and 2 mM un-
labeled oxalate was added to the opposite bath. All buffers contained
5 mM indomethacin to inhibit endogenous prostanoid production.
After a 15 minute equilibration period, unidirectional 14C-oxalate
fluxes were measured for 60 minutes at 15 minute intervals under
short-circuit conditions. The electrical parameters of the tissues were
continuously recorded (at 10–20 second intervals) using Acquire and
Analyze Software (Physiologic Instruments) attached to the chamber.
The viability of the tissue was ensured by treating the tissue with car-
bachol (100 mM, serosally) at the end of the experiment and observing
an immediate increase in short-circuit current.66
A6 Knockdown in C2 Cells
A6 expression in C2 cells was knocked down as previously reported,26
using the same A6 and negative control siRNAs, with minor modifi-
cations as described below. C2 cells were untransfected or transfected
with the NC si or the A6 si. We observed approximately 61% reduc-
tion in A6 total protein expression 2–3 days after transfection, and
most of the studies were performed 3 days after transfection.
SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and Surface Biotinylation
C2 cells were scraped and lysed in lysis buffer (in mM: NaCl=150,
TRIS-HCl=50 [pH 7.4], EDTA=2, Sodium Fluoride=50, NP-40=1%,
Sodium Deoxycholate=0.5%, SDS=0.1%) supplemented with Com-
plete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN). The lysate was then centrifuged (14,000 3 g, 4°C, 10 minutes),
and the supernatant was saved for gel electrophoresis. Total protein
levels were determined and equal amounts of protein lysates were sep-
arated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, with subsequent
electro-transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P; EMD Mil-
lipore). All immunoblots were stained with Ponceau S Solution (0.1%
Ponceau S [w/v] in 5% acetic acid [v/v]) after transfer. For Western
blotting and to block nonspecific binding, polyvinylidene difluoride
strips were first incubated in blotto (5% nonfat dry milk and 0.2%
Tween 20 in tris buffered saline) for 1 hour. Immunoblots were then
incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-A6 antibody (1:100 dilution) (cat-
alog no. sc-26728; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-
GAPDH antibody (1:5000 dilution) (catalog no. sc-32233; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The strips then were washed in blotto and incubated
for 1 hour with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary anti-
bodies (donkey anti-mouse or mouse anti-goat IgG, 1:10,000 dilution).
Antibody reactivitywas detectedwith the enhancedchemiluminescence
system (SuperSignal West; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vernon Hills, IL)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
For the surface biotinylation studies, C2 cells were grown in
0.4 mm collagen-coated polystyrene transwell membrane filters in
24 mm inserts and treated with the CM as described above. Surface
biotinylation studies were performed as previously described.28
Real-Time PCR
RNA was extracted from UTand CM-treated C2 cells using E.Z.N.A.
Total RNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA). RNA was reverse
transcribed and amplified with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Human A1 was amplified
with gene-specific primers (forward primer, 5=-GGACTCCCT-
CAGCGTGCAAACA-3=; reverse primer, 5=-GCGTTAGGGAGG
CGGTGCTTAG-3=). Human A2 was amplified with gene-specific
primers (forward primer, 5=-CGCGGGCGTTTACACTGGCT-3=;

A6 was amplified with gene-specific primers (forward primer, 5=

were expressed as a percentage of UT normalized to GAPDH.

buffered formalin and were fixed at room temperature for 24 hours.
After fixation, the tissues were transferred to 70% reagent alcohol and

Materials
14C-oxalate was purchased from Vitrax (specific activity: 54 mCi/
mmol). H89, PP2, SB 202190, Gö6976, Gö6983, carbachol, genistein,
and LY 294002 were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).
U0126 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). DIDS was pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). H89, PP2, carbachol,
Gö6983, SB 202190, LY 294002, U0126, and genistein were dissolved
in DMSO and stored at 220°C. Gö6976 was dissolved in DMSO and
stored at 4°C. Equivalent volumes of DMSO (0.1%–0.2%) were
added to control media. Of note is that the PKC inhibitors Gö6983
and Gö6976, the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126, the p38 inhibitor SB
202190, the PI3K inhibitor LY 294002, the general tyrosine kinase
inhibitor genistein, and the specific Src family kinase inhibitor PP2
were used at concentrations known to effectively block the relevant
signaling pathways in C2 and T84 intestinal cells.28,67–70
