Mast Cell Disorders in Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome
SURANJITH L. SENEVIRATNE, ANNE MAITLAND
,* AND LAWRENCE AFRIN
Well known for their role in allergic disorders, mast cells (MCs) play a key role in homeostatic mechanisms and
surveillance, recognizing and responding to different pathogens, and tissue injury, with an array of chemical
mediators. After being recruited to connective tissues, resident MCs progenitors undergo further differentiation,
under the influence of signals from surrounding microenvironment. It is the differential tissue homing and local
maturation factors which result in a diverse population of resident MC phenotypes. An abundance of MC reside
in connective tissue that borders with the external world (the skin as well as gastrointestinal, respiratory, and
urogenital tracts). Situated near nerve fibers, lymphatics, and blood vessels, as well as coupled with their ability to
secrete potent mediators, MCs can modulate the function of local and distant structures (e.g., other immune cell
populations, fibroblasts, angiogenesis), and MC dysregulation has been implicated in immediate and delayed
hypersensitivity syndromes, neuropathies, and connective tissue disorders (CTDs). This report reviews basic
biology of mast cells and mast cell activation as well as recent research efforts, which implicate a role of MC
dysregulation beyond atopic disorders and in a cluster of Ehlers–Danlos Syndromes, non-IGE mediated
hypersensitivity disorders, and dysautonomia.

INTRODUCTION: MAST
CELLS AND THEIR
PROPERTIES
In the late 19th century, Paul Ehrlich
named a granule-dense cell, “mast-
zellen,” situated near blood vessels in
the mucosa and connective tissue. He
theorized these cells were providing
nourishment to the local tissue environ-
ment. Using commercial dyes such as
dahlia, toluidine blue, methylene blue,
and neutral red, he noted metachromati-
cally staining mature mast cells (MCs) in
the connective tissue of several organs.
MCs develop from multipotent he-
mopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow
[Moon et al., 2010]. Stem cell factor (KIT
ligand) binds to homodimeric KIT (a
transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor)
andinfluencesMCdifferentiation,growth,
survival, migration, and effector functions.
MCs acquire a tissue specific phenotype
depending on signals they receive from the
local tissue environment. Several factors
such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-4
(IL-4), interleukin-9 (IL-9), and trans-
forming growth factor b1 (TGFb1) have
been shown to influence the number and
mediator content of MCs [Galli et al.,
2011].
Under non-pathological states, ma-
ture differentiated MCs are found exclu-
sively within tissues, compared to other
innate immune cells, such as basophils,
neutrophils, and eosinophils. Within tis-
sues, MCs congregate around nerves,
blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels. Based
on their location (connective tissue or
mucosal)andcontentoftheirgranules,two
types of MCs have been described. MCs
residing in connective tissue, skin, and the
peritonealcavitycontaintryptase(MCT)in
their granules and express interleukin-5
(IL-5) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). MCs
homing to the gut and respiratory mucosa
containtryptaseandchymase(MCTC),and
express IL-4 [Sigal, 2011]. When fully
differentiated, MCs exhibit awide range of
biological properties including phagocyto-
sis, antigen presentation, cytokine and
chemokineproduction,andtheimmediate
release of vasoactive substances. They have
a role in local tissue homeostasis (tissue
repair, angiogenesis) and co-ordination of
immune responses to a myriad of patho-
gens, recognized through evolutionarily
conserved surface receptors like toll-like
receptors, complement receptors, and
receptors for adenosine phosphate, oestro-
gen, and immunoglobulins), physical stim-
uli (pressure, temperature), and toxins. As
yet, no animal model or disease state has

 been identified where there is a complete
lack of MCs [Metcalfe et al., 1997]. When
activated, MCs produce a range of pre-
formed and newly synthesised mediators
(Fig. 1) [Louisias et al., 2013]. Within
minutes of activation, preformed media-
tors (histamine and proteases) are released.
This is followed by de novo synthesis of
membrane-derived lipid mediators (pros-
taglandins and leukotrienes) and a range of
pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines.
MCs residing in connective
tissue, skin, and the
peritoneal cavity contain
tryptase (MCT) in their
granules and express
interleukin-5 (IL-5) and
interleukin-6 (IL-6).
MCs are best known for their role
in immediate IgE-mediated, allergic
responses in anaphylaxis, food allergy,
venom allergy, and asthma. Recent
reports have also implicated MCs in
nonallergic disorders, including head-
ache syndromes, irritable bowel syn-
drome, non-celiac gluten enteropathy,
osteoporosis, autoimmune syndromes,
neuropsychiatric disorders, and intersti-
tial cystitis [Theoharides et al., 2015].
MAST CELLS AND
CONNECTIVE TISSUE
Different components of the extracellu-
lar matrix affect the migration and
differentiation of MC progenitors, MC
activation, and pattern of mediator
release. Human MCs express laminin
receptors and can adhere to fibronectin
and vitronectin.
The hypermobile type of Ehlers–
Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) is the dominant
form of EDS. A subpopulation of hEDS
patients have been found to have MCAD
(more often MCAS than SM). Several
reports have described of co-morbid
clinical manifestations in patients with
CTDs, including EDS, functional gastro-
intestinal disorders [Fikree et al., 2015];
eosinophilic
gastrointestinal
disorders
[Abonia et al., 2013]; an increased preva-
lence of asthma [Morgan et al., 2007],
neuropsychiatric
conditions
[Sinibaldi
et al., 2015], and osteoporosis [Deodhar
and Woolf, 1994]; and orthostatic intoler-
ance [Garland et al., 2015]. Luzgina et al.
[2011] found an increased number of
chymase-positive MCs in the eyelid skin of
patients with CTDs (joint hypermobility,
skin hyper-elasticity, spinal deformities,
thumb and wrist sign, vascular, fragility,
varicose veins, and telangiectasias).
Several reports have described
of co-morbid clinical
manifestations in patients
with CTDs, including

 EDS, functional

eosinophilic gastrointestinal
disorders; an increased
prevalence of asthma,
neuropsychiatric conditions,
and osteoporosis; and
orthostatic intolerance.
Several investigators have noted a
possible link between EDS and MCAD,
primarily patients with the hypermobility
type of EDS. Immunohistochemisty anal-
ysis identified an increased content of
chymase positive MCs in undamaged skin
of patients with signs suggestive of CTDs
(hyperelasticityof the skin, joint hypermo-
bility, spine and thorax deformities, thumb
sign, wrist sign, vascular fragility, varicose
veins, and telangiectasias) [Luzgina et al.,
2011]. Louisias et al. [2013] described
symptoms compatible with a non-IgE
mediated MC disorder in patients with
the joint hypermobility syndrome: most
reported naso-ocular symptoms, asthma,
and history of anaphylaxis and describe a
positive response to classical MC/MC
mediator antagonists. Plasma histamine
and serum tryptase levels were normal
and prostaglandin measurements were not
undertaken. Cheung and Vadas [2015]
suggested a possible new disease cluster:
Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS),
Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syn-
drome (POTS), and EDS. Patients having
a diagnosis of POTS and EDS were given a
screening questionnaire to look for symp-
toms consistent with MCAS, and 66% of
the respondents reported such symptoms.
Recently, Milner et al. identified families
with an elevated, baseline serum tryptase,
which was associated with the triad of
dysautonomia, MCAD, and joint hyper-
mobility [Lyons et al., 2016]. The elevated
tryptase level was not consistent with SM.
Instead, increased copy numbers of the
TPSAB gene, that encodes alpha tryptase,
were detected. Moreover, these observa-

MAST CELL ACTIVATION
DISORDERS
Mast cell activation disorder (MCAD)
refers to an increased number of MCs,
increased activity of MCs, or both. Akin
et al. [2010] classified diseases associated
with MC activation as primary, second-
ary, and idiopathic groups (Table I). The
conditions may be associated with (1)
“an expansion of clonal MCs,” and/or
(2) by increased, aberrant MC mediator
release.
Monoclonal
MC
activation
syndrome
(MMCAS)
was
included
within the primary group; non-clonal
MC activation syndrome (MCAS) was
included within the idiopathic group.
Consensus diagnostic criteria have
been established for most of the forms of
mastocytosis (e.g., the WHO 2008
criteria define the approach to systemic
mastocytosis (SM) [Horny et al., 2008].
However, as MCAS is so recently
recognized, no consensus definition
has yet been established. There are two
proposals for diagnostic criteria for
MCAS [Molderings et al., 2011; Valent
et al., 2012] (Table II). The presence of
EDS (of any form) in the patient’s
history is not known to affect the
approach to diagnostic evaluation for
MCAD.
The most well-known form of
MCAD, MC disorders proven to be
primary/clonal are rare, with an esti-
mated prevalence of one case per
10,000–100,000
persons.
Primary,
clonal MC disorders include mastocy-
tosis and MMCAS. Reported secondary
causes of MC disorders include co-
morbid immune disorders, including
classic atopic syndromes (“allergies”/
IgE-Fce receptor-mediated MC activa-
tion); autoimmune disorders (autoim-
mune
chronic
urticaria,
multiple
sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis) [Benoist
and Mathis, 2002]; and chronic infec-
tions, of which some likely occur in the
context of primary immune deficiency
disorders [Cardet et al., 2013].
Allergic disorders are a well-recog-
nized cause of MC activation (MCA).
Here, allergens cross link IgE molecules
on the surface of MCs, leading to MCA,

 releasing a range of mediators and
producing the well-known range of
allergic manifestations. Physical MC
triggers constitute common, non-IGE
MCADs, such as those affected by
physical urticarias, including cholinergic
and cold-induced urticaria [Simons,
2010]. Research efforts are now describ-
ing mechanisms of non-IGE mediated
MCA. Oxidative mechanical stress has
been shown to induce MC mediator
release [Briganti et al., 2001]. Boyden
et al. [2016] described a missense variant
in ADGRE2 associated with vibratory
urticaria. Recently, in subjects with an
inherited, elevated baseline of serum
tryptase, Milner et al. described a domi-
nant
inheritance
of
increased
copy
number of TPSAB1 gene, which enc-
odes alpha tryptase. Clinical manifesta-
tions
of
hypertryptasemia
include
dysautonomia, joint hypermobility, and
MC activation [Lyons et al., 2016].
Active research is also exploring the
neurohormonal activation of MCs [The-
oharides et al., 2015]. If a clonal MC
disorder is not detected nor a secondary
cause identified, as detailed above, then
children and adults with clinical symp-
tomology and with evidence of aberrant
MC mediator release are deemed to have
idiopathic MCAD [Cardet et al., 2013;
Picard et al., 2013; Theoharides et al.,
2015].
CLINICAL FEATURES OF
MCAD
The clinical presentation of MCAD
tends
to
be
very
heterogeneous.
Clinicians need to be aware of this
so as to suspect the condition and
carry out appropriate testing. Muta-
tional heterogeneity in the affected
MC subsets may contribute to the
heterogeneity of clinical expression.
Common presenting symptoms and
signs of mastocytosis and MCAS are
given in Table III [Alvarez-Twose
et al., 2010; Hamilton et al., 2011].
Conditions that need to be considered
in the differential diagnosis of MCAD
include:
cardiovascular,
endocrine,
gastrointestinal and neurological dis-
orders, infections, and medication-
induced side effects.
The following criteria have been
proposed for diagnosing MCAD:
(1) Typical signs and symptoms of MC
mediator release (affecting at least two
organ systems)
(2) [Akin, 2014; Theoharides et al., 2015]
(3) Objective evidence of MC-derived
mediator release or chronically acti-
vated MCs [Afrin, 2013; Cardet et al.,
2013]
��Although all MCs contain tryp-
tase, there is evidence indicating that
tryptase is not always secreted fol-
lowing
engagement
of
different
MC activation pathways [Marshall,
2004].
(4) Response to therapy that directly or
indirectly blocks MC mediator activ-
ity
[Cardet
et
al.,
2013;
Akin,
2014]
A diagnostic algorithm for MCAD is
shown in Figure 2 [Picard et al.,
2013].
LABORATORY
ASSESSMENT OF MCAD
Diagnostic pursuit of MCAS typically
focuses on probing blood and urine for
elevated levels of mediators relatively
specific to the MC [Afrin and Molder-
ings, 2014]. However, at present, of the
over 100 mediators produced by acti-
vated MCs, only handful can be mea-
sured within commercial laboratories.
Assays certified for clinical use are not
available for most MC mediators, and
even for those MC mediators which can
be tested in the clinical laboratory, most
have an unfavorable level of specificity
for the MC, leaving relatively few
mediators to be tested. Furthermore,
many of the diagnostic tests are not
widely available to the clinician or are
cost-prohibitive. Ideally, serum tryptase
and chromogranin A, plasma histamine,
prostaglandin (PG)D2, and heparin, as
well as urinary (random and 24-hr)
histamine, N-methylhistamine (NMH),
PGD2, 11-b-PGF2a, and leukotriene
(LT) E4 should be assessed. Whether to
pursue such tests in parallel or sequen-
tially depends on the balance between
diagnostic expediency versus contain-
ment of testing costs.

RESEARCH REVIEW
 Some metabolites have longer half-
lives (e.g., tryptase, histamine) and are
thermostabile than others (e.g., heparin,
the prostaglandins). It is prudent to
continuously
chill
all
specimens
throughout
collection and handling
(including centrifugation). The authors
recommend identifying at least two
elevated MC mediator levels (either
the same mediator, or different media-
tors), and preferably across two different
time points (in keeping with the chronic
clinical nature of the disease), before
diagnosing MCAS in a patient with a
history consistent with chronic/recur-
rent aberrant MC mediator release and
absence of any other evident disease
better accounting for the full range and
chronicity of all the symptoms and
findings in the past.
The technical and logistical chal-
lenges in MC mediator testing need to
be acknowledged. If mediator testing is
negative in a patient whose clinical
history strongly suggests MC activation,
repeat testing should be done at a
timepoint when the patient is particu-
larly symptomatic. Upper and/or lower
gastrointestinal tract mucosal biopsies
stained for MCs (CD117 at a minimum)
looking for increased numbers of or
constitutively active MCs also can be
helpful.
Serum Tryptase Levels. Tryptase is
the most abundant protein in MCs and is
heat stable. The amount found in
basophils is about 300 times lower than
in MCs. The human tryptase gene is
located on chromosome 16, and codes
for five isoenzymes: alpha, beta, gamma,
delta, and epsilon. Beta tryptase is the
predominant form stored in the MC
granule. It is found as a tetramer and is
stabilized
by
proteoglycans
such
as
heparin. The isoforms are continuously
released from MCs into the bloodstream
and basal levels are a reflection of total
MC numbers [Schwartz, 2006]. The
ImmunoCAP1 Tryptase assay measures
total tryptase levels (that is all inactive
proforms of alpha-tryptase and beta-
tryptase, as well as the enzymatically
active mature beta-tryptase). The con-
ditions/disorders that cause an elevated
basal serum tryptase level are given in
Table IV
.
Basal
serum
tryptase
levels
of
20 ng/ml are considered as a decision
point in several MC diagnostic criteria.
For example, a basal serum tryptase
level greater than 20 ng/ml is a minor
diagnostic criterion for SM. Valent
et al. [2012] suggested a rise in serum
total tryptase of 20% above baseline,
plus 2 ng/ml, within 4 hr of the onset
of an acute flare of symptoms as a

 significant rise. However, as yet there
has not been clinical validation of this
formula as a discriminating tool for
diagnosing MCAS.
It needs to be stressed that a normal
serum tryptase level does not exclude
MCAS.
Furthermore,
levels
above
20 ng/ml do not exclude MCAS, and
levels below 20 ng/ml do not exclude
SM. Persistence of the serum tryptase
level above 20 ng/ml makes SM more
likely, necessitating marrow examina-
tion to exclude mastocytosis. Even if the
serum tryptase level is persistently below
20 ng/ml, consideration of SM may
need to made if the patient’s history of
illness is more consistent with SM (i.e.,
sudden onset of symptoms in middle or
older age in contrast to MCAS’s usual
history of symptoms dating back to
adolescence or childhood).
Urinary or Plasma Histamine and
Histamine Metabolites
Levels are measured in a 24 hr urine
collection, a spot urine sample and
plasma sample. Sample chilling is im-
portant and special care needs to be
taken with sample collection and stor-
age. The levels are best measured during
an attack or soon thereafter and should
be undertaken within a laboratory with
experience in their measurement.
Prostaglandins and leukotrienes in
urine or plasma: Prostaglandin (PGD2),
11-b-prostaglandin-F2a, or leukotriene
(LTE4) are measured in plasma or a
24-hr urine sample [Sch€
afer et al.,
2014]. The patient needs to take care
in keeping the sample chilled when
collecting a 24 hr urine sample. PG
interpretation is confounded by recent
use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs). When NSAIDs have
not been recently used, the finding of
PG levels below the lower limit of
normal may point toward the loss of the
sample’s thermal integrity while en
route to the reference laboratory.
Histopathological Examination of
Bone Marrow
A bone marrow biopsy needs to be
considered when the baseline tryptase
level is >20 ng/ml or those who have
syncopal or pre-syncopal events as part
of their symptoms (irrespective of the
tryptase levels) [Akin, 2014]. Such an
examination may need to be bilateral to
increase the chances of finding the
typically patchily distributed aggregates
of abnormal MCs [Butterfield and Li,
2004].
In addition to evaluating the num-
ber of MCs, changes in morphology or
distribution and evidence of degranula-
tion should be looked for. Antibodies
against
KIT
(i.e.,
CD117),
CD25,
tryptase,
and
chymase
should
be
used. Flow cytometric assessment for
co-expression of CD117 together with
CD25 and/or CD2, CD30, and muta-
tional assessment for mutations in KIT
(in particular, the KIT D816V mutation
at a minimum) should be done. CD25
expression in MCs is a minor diagnostic
criterion in SM. When MCAS seems
more likely than SM, marrow examina-
tion
is
usually
unhelpful.
Even
if
MMCAS is found on flow cytometric
or mutational testing, at present there
are no known differences in prognosis
of, or the therapeutic approach toward,
MMCAS versus MCAS.
Histopathological Examination of
Other Tissues
If mediator testing is unrevealing, the
Molderings diagnostic criteria (REF)
provide an alternative path to diagnosis
of MCAS, namely, finding increased
MCs in extracutaneous tissue, most
commonly gastrointestinal (GI) or gen-
itourinary (GU) tract mucosal biopsies.
Biopsy specimens obtained from the
gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder,
and skin should be stained for mast cells.
A cut-off of >20 MCs per high power
field has been considered by several
groups when interpreting the tissue
biopsy findings. Traditionally, staining
of tissue biopsies for MC disease has
employed stains targeting MC granules
or their contents, for example, tryptase,
Giemsa, toluidine blue, Alcian blue, etc.

clear that CD117 (the dominant MC
regulatory element brightly present on
virtually all MCs) more reliably reveals
MCs [Feyerabend et al., 2005; Leclere
et al., 2006]. Given that the essence of
MCAD is inappropriate MCA and thus
inappropriate MC degranulation, rely-
ing on granule-targeting stains may
increase the false negative rate. MCs in
SM are found in abnormal aggregates
but
remain
normally
dispersed
in
MCAS. Furthermore, the MCs in SM
typically are of aberrant morphology
(most commonly spindled) while in
MCAS they retain their normal round
to ovoid shape. Again, CD117 co-
expression with CD25 and/or CD2 is
uncommonly found on flow cytometry
in MCAS (whether in marrow or other
tissue), and KIT codon 816 mutations,
too, are rarely found in MCAS.
Gene Mutation Analysis
Although KIT D816V mutation testing
by routine PCR analysis in the blood of
SM patients is often positive (but far
from perfect), this testing is virtually
always negative in the far more prevalent
setting of MCAS. Real-time quantita-
tive PCR testing for KIT D816V is far
more sensitive and has been shown in at
least one study to be positive in 100% of
SM patients [Kristensen et al., 2011].
There
have
been
no
reports
that
investigated
this
technique
in
the
MCAS population.
Molderings [2015] have published
two studies showing that on “full
sequencing” of MC KIT, although one
or more mutations are found in almost
every MCAS patient, codon 816 muta-
tions (whether D816Vor any other) are
virtually never found in MCAS. Clearly,
codon 816 mutations have consequen-
ces
that
strongly
influence
the
development of MCAD toward the
mastocytosis phenotype. Without co-
don 816 mutations, it is far more likely
MCAD will develop toward the MCAS
phenotype. Although testing for this
mutation on a bone marrow sample is
more appropriate in SM, some patients
do not wish to undergo the more
invasive procedure.
Chromogranin A (CgA)
CgA is a heat-stable, 439-amino acid
protein, and a member of the granin
family of proteins. Granins are wide-
spread in endocrine, neuroendocrine,
peripheral, and central nervous tissues,
where they are found in secretory
granules. CgA is also secreted by MCs.
It is known to be elevated in heart and
renal failure, neuroendocrine cancer,
and
when
proton
pump
inhibitors
(PPIs) are being used. PPI therapy
should be omitted for at least 5 days
prior to measurement of baseline levels.
Plasma Heparin
Heparin may be the single best perform-
ing diagnostic marker for MC activation
[Vysniauskaite et al., 2015]. However,
the level of endogenous plasma heparin
found normally and even in most cases of
MCAS is below the lower limits of
detection of most clinical assays for this
metabolite (typically 0.10–0.30 anti-
Factor Xa units/ml). Standard clinical
assays are engineered to assist with
monitoring of heparin therapy, which
produces far higher levels of heparin than
found normally or in MCAS. Thus,
although an occasional MCAS patient
may present a level detectable by one of
the commonly used assays, typically a
more sensitive assay is needed. As the
half-life of heparin is approximately
1 min (similar to PGD2), sample chilling
is important.
TREATMENT OF MCAD
MCAD is presently incurable (except
for the rare instance of a solid mastocy-
toma) and therapy, is therefore, symp-
tomatic except when cytoreduction is
additionally required in advanced mas-
tocytosis. MCAD therapy should always
include maneuvers aimed at controlling
MC mediator production, release, and
end-organ effects.
Many cases of childhood cutaneous
mastocytosis (CM) seem to spontaneously
regress in adolescence. However, it seems
that MCAS emerges in at least some such
patients within several years after regres-
sion of CM (personal observation, LBA).
Only in the relatively rare forms of SM
which either are aggressive malignancies
themselves (e.g., aggressive SM or MC
leukemia) or are associated with signifi-
cant malignancies (e.g., SM with associ-
ated clonal hematologic non-MC-lineage
disease, or SM-AHNMD in the WHO
2008 classification) are cytotoxic/chemo-
therapeutic and cellular therapies consid-
ered.Suchtherapieshavebeenextensively
discussed elsewhere in the literature and
are beyond the scope of this paper.
In general, co-morbidity of EDS
(any form) is not known to affect the
approach
to
treatment
of
MCAD,
except to note that chronic glucocorti-
coid therapy (a poor choice anyway in
MCAD given the treatment’s chronic
toxicities, including in connective tis-
sues) may be an even poorer choice in
MCAD patients also featuring EDS.
Desensitization therapy can be consid-
ered.
It
is
important
that
patients
identify
potential
triggers for
their
symptoms (dietary, chemicals, medica-
tions,
allergens),
and environmental
modifications,
to
reduce
exposures.
Common MC triggers are given in
Table V
. MCAD patients have many
physical sensitivities (e.g., heat, cold,
ultraviolet radiation, exertion, etc.) and
antigenic sensitivities (e.g.,pollen, mold,
etc.). There is a core group of foods
(tending to be patient-specific) that
many patients find difficult to consume
without developing adverse symptoms.

 Patients and clinicians should be
alert to the propensity of MCAD
patients to react to medication exci-
pients. The emergence of adverse reac-
tion within the first few doses of an
ordinarily well tolerated medication
should prompt (1) a review of the
formulation’s ingredient list to try to
identify a particular offending excipient;
and (2) identification of alternative
formulations to be tried, containing as
few of the excipients in the offending
formulation
as
possible.
Sometimes
MCAD patients benefit from custom-
compounded
formulations
of
their
medications.
Some MCAS patients are highly
reactive to a range of foodstuffs. Elimi-
nation diets such as described for the
eosinophilic esophagitis population are
helpful in some patients but not others.
As with medication trials, diet trials
typically need to last only 1–2 months to
determine if they are going to be
significantly beneficial. The implemen-
tation of more than one change around
the same time (e.g., a dietary change
around the same time as a medication
change) can be greatly confounding and
should be avoided.
In spite of the substantial fatigue
and malaise that many MCAD patients
experience, they should be strongly
encouraged to exercise regularly. This
should only be to the usual individual
limit of tolerance that each patient has
likely learned from experience. This is
because overexertion could trigger a
flare of MC activation in some patients.
Since both physical and psychological
stress have long been known to activate
MCs, interventions
aimed
at stress
reduction (e.g., psychotherapy) can be
helpful.
In spite of the substantial
fatigue and malaise that many
MCAD patients experience,
they should be strongly
encouraged to exercise
regularly. This should only be
to the usual individual limit
of tolerance that each patient
has likely learned from
experience.
An effective “primary” physician—
whether a primary care physician or
specialist—is critically important for
successful management of most complex
diseases, including MCAD. The absence
of a local “physician/partner” who can
reliably help the patient access local
health care resources as needed and
remote resources could lead to the
MCAD patient facing difficulty in
gaining and then maintaining control
over their disease.
Drug treatment needs to be tailored
to the individual patient as their toler-
ance and the symptomatic benefit they
receive tends to vary. Commonly used
medications include H1 and H2 antihist-
amines, sodium cromoglicate, ketotifen,
omlaizumab, and the leukotriene recep-
tor blockers. Medications should usually
be added one at a time, with an adequate
time interval between the additions of
successive drugs. Some patients need to
begin medications at a lower dose and
then gradually escalate to a standard
dose. Patients need to be told that the
time for noticing an initial symptomatic
response may be a few weeks [Cardet
et al., 2013; Akin, 2014; Zhang et al.,
2016].
Many agents have been shown to
significantly help various MCAD pa-
tients, but at present therapeutic re-
sponse
profiles
appear
highly
individualized. There are no biomarkers
predictive of response in general or of
which symptoms will respond to any
given agent in a given patient.
H1 and H2 Antihistamines
These medications block the H1 and H2
receptors present on many end organs
and on MCs themselves, too. They have
been in use for many years and most
doctors are aware of their beneficial
effects and potential adverse effects.
Longer acting, generally non-sedating
second generation H1 antihistamines
(e.g., cetirizine, fexofenadine, lorata-
dine) have been used in preference to
the older, sedating H1 antihistamines.
Most
patients
need a higher dose
(between two to four times) the dose

 used for treatment of mild hay fever
symptoms. Many patients find a 2–3
times daily dosing to be more helpful
than a once daily dosing regimen. The
H2
antihistamines
(e.g.,
ranitidine,
famotidine) are helpful for abdominal
symptoms
and
sometimes
benefit
extra-gastrointestinal
symptoms,
too.
Antihistamines need to be taken for an
adequate length of time. Patients should
be discouraged in making frequent
changes to the doses they take.
Sodium Cromoglicate
Many patients add the MC-stabilising
drug sodium cromoglicate to their H1/H2
antihistamines, with a view to getting
additional symptomatic benefit. It is
important that mediator measurements
are done prior to this medication been
added. Some patients experience a flare of
symptoms during the initial few days of
taking this drug. Oral, liquid, inhaled, and
ophthalmic formulations are available.
Although the drug is poorly absorbed
and undergoes little systemic circulation,
there is a systemic (IV) formulation in
development.
Ketotifen
This has both MC-stabilising and anti-
histamine effects. A few patients are not
able to tolerate this because of drowsi-
ness.
Tablet,
liquid,
and
eye
drop
formulations are available. Oral ketotifen
is an inexpensive drug, but its availability
in the UnitedStates only in compounded
form increases its expense there.
Leukotriene Receptor Blockers
(e.g., Montelukast)
This is a widely used medication in
asthma and spontaneous chronic urticaria
patients. It is generally well tolerated.
Administration twice daily may benefit
MCAD patients more than once daily.
Steroids
The long-term use of oral steroids at any
dose is discouraged due to well-known
toxicities. In addition to its many adverse
effects, its effect on bone density would
not be helpful in patients with a disorder
of connective tissue such as EDS.
However, the use of a short course of
steroids may be needed if there is acute
onset of skin or airway reactivity. Low
dose inhaled steroids may be needed if
airway hyper-reactivity is present.
Self-Injectable Epinephrine
Devices
All patients with systemic MC activation
or susceptible to anaphylaxis should be
prescribed two self-injectable epinephrine
devices and taught how and when this
should be used. A glucagon autoinjector
may be needed instead if the patient
requires beta adrenergic receptor blockade.
Other Medications
From the few reports available, non-
steroidal immunosuppressants such as
cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, azathi-
oprine, and monoclonal antibodies such
as omalizumab [Zhang et al., 2016] and
alemtuzumab are only occasionally help-
ful [Afrin, 2013]. Several patients find a
range of other preparations (such as
vitamin C, aspirin, flavone analogues,
cannabinoids, etc.) to help their symp-
toms. Low-dose hydroxyurea helps some
MCAD patients and is safely used for
years to decades—indeed, life-long—in
certain other diseases. A wide range of
supportive medications are used by the
MCAD population including decon-
gestants, bronchodilators, antiemetics,
proton pump inhibitors, anti-depressants
of various classes (e.g. tricyclic agents),
bowel motility agents, micronutrient
supplements, pancreatic enzyme supple-
ments, bone-strengthening agents such
asbisphosphonates,tumor necrosisfactor
(TNF) alpha antagonists, etc.
Next to fatigue, pain is one of the
most common symptoms of MCAD.
NSAIDs help some patients but are
triggers
(potentially
to
anaphylactic
extent) in others and must be initiated
cautiously when no history of NSAID
tolerance is known. Narcotics, too,
commonly are triggers; fentanyl, trama-
dol, and hydromorphone tend to be
better tolerated than other narcotics in
MCAD
patients.
Sometimes
other
classes of MC-targeted agents typically
without analgesic effect nevertheless
prove
analgesic
(e.g.,
antihistamines
may relieve chronic migraine headaches
in some MCAS patients).
Given the rarity of SM, together
with how recently MCAS has come to
be
recognized,
there are no
large
controlled studies of any intervention
for MCAD. Few clinical trials in SM
have been performed, and there have
been no clinical trials yet in MCAS.
Patient and treating clinician alike must
take a methodical approach in stepping
through trials of the many therapies
shown helpful in various MCAD pa-
tients, limiting to one change at a time in
the regimen whenever possible. Most
such treatment trials need last only 1–2
months, typically starting at low doses
and escalating step-wise as tolerated to
identify
maximal
effective
dosing.
Clearly significantly effective treatments
are retained, while others not meeting
that high bar are stopped lest unman-
ageable polypharmacy develop. In the
absence of a more scientifically in-
formed strategy at present, proceeding
in order of treatment cost often is the
most reasonable approach.
The most inexpensive and sustain-
able therapy for MCAD includes the
histamine H1 and H2 receptor blockers.
Benzodiazepines, NSAIDs including as-
pirin (in patients that can tolerate them),
flavonoids (such as quercetin and luteo-
lin), alpha lipoic acid, N-acetylcysteine,
and Vitamin C are also inexpensive
interventions.
Leukotriene
receptor
blockers and synthesis inhibitors are
somewhat more expensive, as are sodium
cromoglicate, pentosan, and cannabi-
noids. Emergency and perioperative
management of severe flares of mast cell
disease has been amply discussed in the
literature and is available publicly [Akin,
2014]. In general, histamine H1 and H2
receptor
antagonists,
glucocorticoids,
and benzodiazepines form the core of
the therapeutic attack at such a problem.
The clinical (and suspected underly-
ing mutational) heterogeneity of MCAD
ensure each therapy found helpful in
certain patients will fail in others. Thus,
failure of any given therapy (even antihist-
amines) should not be taken as a sign of

 either misdiagnosis or “refractory” dis-
ease. With sufficient persistence at trying
various interventions, most patients with
non-malignant MCAD can eventually
identifya regimen thathelps them achieve
the presently subjective goal of feeling
significantly better than the pre-treatment
baseline the majority of the time.
