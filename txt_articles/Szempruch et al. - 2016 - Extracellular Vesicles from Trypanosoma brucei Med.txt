SUMMARY
Intercellular communication between parasites and
with host cells provides mechanisms for parasite
development, immune evasion, and disease pathol-
ogy. Bloodstream African trypanosomes produce
membranous nanotubes that originate from the
flagellar membrane and disassociate into free extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs). Trypanosome EVs contain
several flagellar proteins that contribute to virulence,
and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense EVs con-
tain the serum resistance-associated protein (SRA)
necessary for human infectivity. T. b. rhodesiense
EVs transfer SRA to non-human infectious trypano-
somes, allowing evasion of human innate immunity.
Trypanosome EVs can also fuse with mammalian
erythrocytes, resulting in rapid erythrocyte clearance
and anemia. These data indicate that trypanosome
EVs are organelles mediating non-hereditary viru-
lence factor transfer and causing host erythrocyte
remodeling, inducing anemia.
INTRODUCTION
Bacteria and eukaryotic cells use extracellular vesicles (EVs) as
vehicles for delivery of modulatory proteins, lipids and nucleic
acids to neighboring cells (Schorey et al., 2015; Ya
´ n
˜ ez-Mo
´ et al.,
2015).Extracellular vesiclesgenerally fall intotwo classes: (1) exo-
somes produced in the exocytic pathways and generally associ-
ated with the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), and (2)
ectosomes formed by budding of the plasma membrane. Both
carry effector proteins and nucleic acids (Schorey et al., 2015;
Wood and Rosenbaum, 2015). Functions proposed for EVs
include transfer of drug resistance, growth regulation, quorum
sensing, immune regulation, developmental modulation, and
neurotransmission (Remis et al., 2014). In addition, several human
diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration,
as well as viral and parasite infections are affected by EV produc-
tion. A clear and defining function of EVs is the delivery of modu-
latory molecules to other cells within and between species. The
range of functions attributed to EVs is reflected in diverse mecha-
nisms of EV biogenesis and composition (Schorey et al., 2015).
The kinetoplastidae is a diverse group of eukaryotic microbes
responsible for several important human and animal diseases
including African sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei rhode-
siense and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense), Chagas disease
(Trypanosoma cruzi), Kala azar (Leishmania donovani), and
Nagana in cattle (Trypanosoma brucei brucei). T. cruzi and Leish-
mania spp. have been shown to release EVs that interact with
host cells and modulate immune responses (Marcilla et al.,
2014). Other eukaryote pathogens also produce EVs. EVs
derived from Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes pro-
mote parasite differentiation and regulate immune cells within
the mammalian host (Mantel et al., 2013; Regev-Rudzki et al.,
2013). The urogenital tract parasite Trichomonas vaginalis pro-
duces EVs that alter adherence to host cells and modulate the
host immune response to infection (Twu et al., 2013).
Humans and other higher primates are innately immune to
many African trypanosomes by virtue of circulating trypanosome
lytic factors (TLF). Human pathogenic T. b. rhodesiense circum-
vents TLF activity through expression of a virulence factor,
the serum-resistance associated protein (SRA) (De Greef and
Hamers, 1994). The mechanism of SRA involves binding to apoli-
poprotein L-1 (ApoL-1), a pore forming toxin within TLF (Van-
hamme et al., 2003). Binding, uptake, and intracellular trafficking
of TLF to early endosomes of T. b. rhodesiense leads to co-local-
ization of SRA and TLF, facilitating the neutralization of ApoL-1
activity (Stephens and Hajduk, 2011). Transfection of T. b. brucei
with the gene encoding SRA or co-infection of tsetse flies with
T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. brucei allows for transfer of the
gene encoding SRA to T. b. brucei and confers resistance to
TLF (Gibson et al., 2015; Xong et al., 1998). Direct transfer of
this virulence protein between trypanosomes has not been
reported.

 Like many extracellular pathogens, African trypanosome
infection initially elicits a type 1 immune response that includes
expression of inflammatory cytokines and activation of myeloid
cells. These host immune responses have been implicated in
the pathology of trypanosomiasis-associated anemia (Stijle-
mans et al., 2015). Anemia is markedly severe during acute infec-
tion and is the major cause of cattle death due to Nagana (Naes-
sens, 2006). Recently, erythrophagocytosis by activated liver
and spleen myeloid cells has been identified as a major contrib-
utor to erythrocyte clearance. In addition, the lipid composition
of erythrocytes is altered during trypanosome infection and
these erythrocytes are preferentially phagocytosed by the host’s
myeloid cells (Stijlemans et al., 2015). While host responses that
contribute to anemia have been characterized, the parasite fac-
tors that elicit erythrocyte clearance are unknown.
Here, we describe a dynamic class of membrane nanotubes
that bud from the trypanosome flagellar membrane and vesicu-
larize to form EVs. The proteome of these EVs is enriched for
specific flagellar membrane proteins and contains a number of
proteins implicated in virulence and persistence within the
host. Functionally, we show that T. brucei EVs fuse with target
lipid bilayers, including the flagellar pocket of neighboring try-
panosomes, resulting in transfer and internalization of lipids
and proteins. Transferred proteins retain activity since T. b. rho-
desiense EVs transfer SRA to T. b. brucei resulting in resistance
to TLF. T. brucei EVs are also highly fusogenic with host erythro-
cyte membranes, altering the physical properties of the mem-
brane and causing erythrocyte clearance from circulation. We
postulate that this causes anemia during animal and human
infection by African trypanosomes. Our findings show that EVs
contribute to the complexity of African trypanosomiasis through
the transfer of virulence factors between parasites and inadver-
tent interaction with host cells, which has a profound effect on
disease.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Flagellar Membrane Budding Gives Rise to Nanotubes
and EVs in T. brucei
Exchange of metabolites, nucleic acids, and proteins in bacteria
can take place over short and long distances via the formation of
membrane nanotubes between individual bacterium and pro-
duction and delivery of EVs (Dubey and Ben-Yehuda, 2011).
Cell-cell communication occurs in the eukaryotic pathogen
T. b. brucei as demonstrated by quorum sensing-mediated dif-
ferentiation into the tsetse fly transmissible short-stumpy devel-
opmental form in the mammalian bloodstream (Mony et al.,
2014) and social motility exhibited by procyclic forms in the in-
sect vector midgut (Oberholzer et al., 2010). The molecular
mechanisms underlying these communication processes in Afri-
can trypanosomes have not yet been identified.
Visualization of bloodstream form (BF) T. b. brucei by differen-
tial interference contrast (DIC) video microscopy revealed the
presence of highly dynamic filamentous structures (2–20 mm)
extending from the posterior end of some cells (Figure 1A).
These structures resembled previously described thread-like
appendages, later called plasmanemes, associated with BF Af-
rican trypanosomes (Babudieri and Tomasini, 1962; Schepilew-
sky, 1912; Vickerman and Luckins, 1969). Occasionally filaments
appeared to make connections with the posterior ends of other
trypanosomes and if unattached become highly branched (Fig-
ure 1A). These structures were largely disregarded due to lack
of detection from blood of infected mice (Ellis et al., 1976; Wright
et al., 1970). To determine if these structures were physiologi-
cally relevant, we performed DIC video microscopy of infected
mouse blood. Similar filamentous structures were also visible
on T. brucei in the blood of infected mice (Figures 1B and
S1A). The formation of the filaments in vitro was stimulated by
stress from RNAi against an essential BF protein or by addition
of complement active serum to growth medium (Figure S1B)
(Sykes et al., 2015). These induction mechanisms allowed us
to investigate filament biogenesis.
Live imaging of BF T. brucei labeled with the membrane bind-
ing dye octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) suggested that filaments
were bounded by a lipid membrane and led us to rename the
plasmanemes ‘‘membrane nanotubes’’ to better reflect their
structure and composition (Figure 1C; Movies S1 and S2).
Observations of nanotubes connecting cells showed these inter-
actions were stable over long distances (>20 mm) and highly dy-
namic, releasing and forming new connections with several cells
over time (Figure 1D; Movie S3). When visualized by negative
stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nascent nano-
tubes showed a continuous membrane (Figures 1E and S1C),
consistent with previous observations using negative stain and
thin section TEM (Frevert and Reinwald, 1988; Vickerman and
Luckins, 1969). Although it has been shown previously that short
stumpy T. brucei produce ‘‘secretory-filaments,’’ we restricted
our studies to exponentially growing long slender BF T. brucei
(Ellis et al., 1976). Nanotubes were restricted to the cell posterior,
suggesting a polarized point of origin. TEM of thin sections re-
vealed membrane budding from the flagellum, with similar char-
acteristics to the adjacent flagellar membrane (Figures 1F and
S1D), and three-dimensional reconstruction of serial sections
showed that protrusion of the flagellar membrane gave rise to
a tubular structure lacking the axoneme and paraflagellar rod
(Figure 1G; Movie S4). These observations suggested that
T. brucei nanotubes developed from budding of the flagellar
membrane and extended for at least a short distance parallel
to the flagellum. Longitudinal sections through nanotubes re-
vealed repeating spherical units resembling ‘‘beads on a string’’
outside the flagellar pocket at the cell surface (Figure 2A). The
average diameter of a ‘‘bead’’ was �100 nm (Figure 2B). The ve-
sicular appearance of trypanosome nanotubes resembles the
vesicle chains that dissociate to produce free EVs in the bacte-
rium Myxococcus xanthus (Dubey and Ben-Yehuda, 2011).
These observations are similar to previous reports from trypano-
somes (Babudieri and Tomasini, 1962; Ellis et al., 1976; Frevert
and Reinwald, 1988; Schepilewsky, 1912). Indeed, scanning
electron microscopy revealed trypanosome-associated vesicles
consistent in size with nanotube beads (Figure 2C). Using
DIC video microscopy, we observed the dynamics of formation,
release and disassociation of a nanotube into diffusible EVs (Fig-
ure 2D; Movie S5). Release from nanotubes allowed us to purify,
characterize, and investigate the cellular interactions of trypano-
some EVs derived from exponentially growing cells that have not
been stimulated for nanotube formation.

 The EV Proteome Is Enriched in Flagellar Membrane
Proteins and Parasite Virulence Factors
When viewed by negative stain, TEM purified EVs appear as uni-
lamellar vesicles �70–80 nm in diameter, consistent with the size
of nanotube-associated beads (Figure 2E, upper panel). TEM
thin section analysis of purified EVs revealed membrane-bound
vesicles of �80 nm in size with a 10-nm thick membrane (Figures
2E, lower panel, and S1E) with similar characteristics to cell
plasma membrane (Figure S1F). Nanoparticle tracking analysis
revealed a major population of vesicles with a mean diameter
of 81 nm and a minor population 165 nm in diameter (Figure 2F).
Purified EVs showed a different SDS-PAGE protein profile than
total cell (Figure 2G). Proteomic analysis of EVs revealed 156
proteins from diverse functional classes (Table S1) and several
were confirmed by western blotting, including the expressed
variant surface glycoprotein (VSG 221), Hsp-70, glycerol kinase,
and aldolase (Figure 2H). Similar to observations from Leish-
mania spp., we detected ribosomal proteins in the T. brucei EV
proteome (Silverman et al., 2010). Although it is not uncommon
to screen out proteins based on high isoelectric point, removing

 many ribosomal proteins, we performed an analysis on the
complete/unfiltered 156 proteins (Figure 2I; Tables S1 and S2)
(Broadhead et al., 2006). Comparison of the EV proteome with
that of the flagellar surface and flagellar matrix showed signifi-
cant overlap (Figure 2I) (Oberholzer et al., 2011). Our analysis
showed that 50 of 156 EV proteins were either flagellar matrix
or membrane proteins representing 32% of the EV proteome.
In addition, we found only minor similarity with the glycosome
(2%) and mitochondrial (2%) proteomes (Gu
¨ ther et al., 2014;
Panigrahi et al., 2009) (Figure 2I; Table S2), which is proportion-
ally similar when compared to the total proteome; therefore, EVs
from T. b. brucei BFs are not enriched with proteins from these
two organelles. Ten of these proteins have previously been co-
localized by fluorescence microcopy and were shown to be
flagellar/flagellar-associated (Table S2). While the EVs appear
homogeneous in size and morphology, they may be derived
from multiple mechanisms of origin. Enrichment of EVs with
flagellar proteins is consistent with a population of EVs being
derived from nanotubes that form by budding of the flagellar
membrane. We observed that in addition to abundant proteins
such as VSG more than 20% of the EVs composition was from
low abundance proteins (Table S2) (Jensen et al., 2014). Among
these minor proteins were several flagellar proteins, including
calflagin (CF), adenylate cyclase (GRESAG4), glycosylphospha-
tidylinositol phospholipase C (GPI-PLC), and metacaspase 4
(MCA4), that contribute to the virulence of T. brucei in the
mammalian host (Table S2) (Emmer et al., 2010; Proto et al.,
2011; Salmon et al., 2012; Webb et al., 1997). We next deter-
mined whether African trypanosomes expressing SRA, a well-
characterized virulence factor, release EVs containing this
protein. Extracellular vesicles were purified from a T. b. brucei
line expressing a Ty-epitope tagged SRA (T. b. bruceiSRA-Ty)
(Oli et al., 2006), and western blots demonstrated the presence
of SRA in these preparations (Figure 2J). The diversity of viru-
lence factors detected in the EV proteome suggests that the
flagellum may serve as part of a sorting pathway for delivery of
biologically active molecules to neighboring cells.
T. b. rhodesiense EVs Transfer SRA to T. b. brucei and
Confers Resistance to TLF
The observation that SRA was present in EVs led us to investi-
gate whether SRA could be transferred to TLF susceptible
T. b. brucei. We used flow cytometry to determine whether
EVs from T. b. bruceiSRA-Ty bound and were taken-up by wild-
type T. b. brucei (Figures 3A and 3B). T. b. brucei were incubated
with SRA-Ty containing EVs at 37�C, washed to remove un-
bound EVs and fixed with paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were
either treated directly with anti-Ty antibody and a fluorescent
secondary antibody (Figure 3A) or first treated with low concen-
trations of detergent (0.1% Triton X-100) to permeabilize the
cells prior to addition of antibodies (Figure 3B). EV-treated
wild-type T. b. brucei became SRA-Ty positive after detergent
treatment, suggesting that EVs delivered SRA-Ty that accumu-
lated in an intracellular location that was accessible to antibodies
only following detergent permeabilization. Immunofluorescence
microscopy indicated that SRA-Ty delivered by EVs was inter-
nalized by wild-type T. b. brucei and co-localized with concanav-
alin A (ConA) a marker for the trypanosome endocytic pathway
(Figures 3C and S2A–S2C). Together, these data indicated that
SRA from EVs was deposited in the endolysosomal system of
recipient trypanosomes. Since SRA localizes to endosomes in
T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. bruceiSRA-Ty, these observations sug-
gested EV transfer of SRA may protect recipient T. b. brucei from
TLF killing (Stephens and Hajduk, 2011).
There have been a number of reported human infections by
non-human infectious species of trypanosomes (Truc et al.,
2013). While these may represent either misidentification of the
parasite or genetic acquisition of TLF resistance, an alternative
possibility is transfer of SRA to TLF susceptible trypanosomes
during a dual infection with T. b. rhodesiense. Our discovery
that SRA was transferred by EVs to T. b. brucei and localized
to an endolysosomal compartment led us to ask whether co-
cultivation of T. b. brucei SRA-Ty or T. b. rhodesiense with wild-
type T. b. brucei conferred TLF resistance (Figures 3D–3F and
S2D). Co-cultivation of T. b. brucei SRA-Ty and T. b. bruceiHyg al-
lowed selection of a small (20%) but reproducible fraction of cells
showing dual resistance to TLF and hygromycin (Figure S2D). In
order to avoid the long selection time needed for the outgrowth
of hygromycin-resistant cells, recipient T. b. brucei were cultured
in a transwell system separated by a 0.2 mm filter from either T. b.
brucei SRA-Ty or T. b. rhodesiense. The transwell membrane pre-
vented direct contact between the donor and recipient cells but
allowed diffusion of EVs into the compartment containing the
recipient T. b. brucei (Figure 3D). Co-cultivation of T. b. brucei
opposite T. b. brucei SRA-Ty or T. b. rhodesiense in transwells
led to an increase in TLF-resistant T. b. brucei with the percent-
age of cells surviving overnight incubation with TLF approaching
levels observed for untreated cells (Figures 3E and 3F).
While these co-cultivation studies were consistent with EV
transfer of SRA to recipient cells, they did not exclude the possi-
bility that diffusible, non-EV-associated SRA could cross the
transwell membrane conferring TLF resistance to the recipient
cells. To exclude this possibility, purified EVs were added
directly to wild-type T. b. brucei (Figure 3G). Addition of EVs
from T. b. bruceiSRA-Ty or T. b. rhodesiense but not EVs from
wild-type T. b. brucei increased TLF resistance of recipient
T. b. brucei in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 3H, 3I, and
S2E). These data indicated that functional SRA was transferred
by EVs to co-cultured trypanosomes leading to resistance
to TLF.
Trypanosome EVs Are Highly Fusogenic and Rapidly
Transfer Proteins and Lipids to Recipient Trypanosomes
Internalization of EV-associated SRA by recipient T. b. brucei
could be by receptor-mediated or fluid-phase endocytosis of
EVs or may reflect direct fusion of EVs with the trypanosome
plasma membrane. To determine the site of interaction and sub-
sequent fate of EV proteins, we labeled purified trypanosome
EVs with Alexa-Fluor594 and followed the binding and localiza-
tion of these proteins in T. brucei. When endocytosis was
blocked, by maintaining cells at 3�C, EV proteins accumulated
in the flagellar pocket as indicated by co-localization with
ConA (Figure 4A). Binding of EVs to the trypanosome flagellar
pocket was nonsaturable, suggesting a receptor-independent
process (Figure S3A). This T. brucei EV binding could not be
competed away with unlabeled BF T. brucei EVs (Figures S3B
250
Cell 164, 246–257, January 14, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
 and S3C) or with EVs from a different life cycle stage (Figures
S3D and S3E), related kinetoplastid Leishmania tarentolae (Fig-
ures S3F and S3G), or with human erythrocyte microvesicles
(Figures S3H–S3K). After warming to 37�C, to allow endocytosis,
both ConA and labeled EV proteins localized within endolysoso-
mal vesicles (Figure 4B). T. b. brucei EVs bound and were taken
up independent of the expressed VSG (Figure S4A) and subspe-
cies of T. brucei (Figure S4B).
Since EV binding and uptake by T. b. brucei was receptor-in-
dependent and because EVs from other cell types have been
shown to fuse with target cell membranes (Evans et al., 2012; Vi-
dal and Hoekstra, 1995), we asked whether T. brucei EVs were
fusogenic. Trypanosome EVs were purified and labeled with a
self-quenching concentration of the lipophilic fluorophore octa-
decyl rhodamine B (R18). When R18-labeled EVs were incu-
bated with T. brucei, a time-dependent increase in fluorescence
was observed, indicating dilution of the fluorophore and sug-
gesting fusion of the EVs with T. brucei membranes (Figure 4C).
When visualized by ImageStream flow-cytometry, the R18 signal
appeared initially localized to the posterior ends of cells and sub-
sequently spread over the entire surface of the cell (Figures 4D,
4E, and S4C). These data are consistent with EVs fusing to the
flagellar pocket membrane and rapid equilibration of EV lipids
throughout the trypanosome membranes.
Trypanosome EVs Are Fusogenic with Artificial
Liposomes and Mammalian Erythrocytes
To determine whether EV fusion was due to unique features
of the flagellar pocket membrane of trypanosomes, purified
R18-labeled T. b. brucei EVs were incubated with unlabeled 1-
palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) large
unilamellar liposomes (LUV). A time-dependent increase in

 fluorescence was observed as R18 was diluted into the unla-
beled LUV membranes due to fusion (Figure 5A). Trypsinization
of EVs ablated fusion, but EVs retained R18 loading requiring
detergent treatment for R18 release, indicating that a(n) exposed
EV protein(s) was necessary for membrane fusion (Figure 5A).
Since T. b. brucei is an extracellular parasite within the circu-
latory system, host erythrocytes would present abundant target
membranes for EV fusion. Therefore, we investigated whether
T. b. brucei EVs fuse with mammalian erythrocytes. Purified
EVs, but not POPC LUV, fused with human erythrocyte ghosts
and fusion was ablated by trypsinization of the EV (Figure 5B).
Flow cytometry indicates that EVs fuse with intact erythrocytes
and transfer R18 from EVs to erythrocytes (Figure 5C). Fluores-
cence microscopy of R18-EV-treated erythrocytes revealed a
diffuse R18 signal spread over the surface of the cell (Figure 5D).
Fusion also resulted in transfer of Alexa-Fluor-labeled EV pro-
teins to erythrocytes (Figure 5E). Therefore, EVs facilitate transfer
of trypanosome lipid and protein to host erythrocytes. To further

address this possibility, BF T. b. brucei
were labeled with R18, incubated with
erythrocytes separated in 0.2 mm trans-
wells and erythrocytes analyzed by flow
cytometry (Figure 5F). Consistent with
T. b. brucei EVs transfer, we found that
erythrocytes became labeled with R18
under these conditions.
T. b. brucei EV Fusion Modifies
Erythrocytes and Causes Anemia
Rifkin and Landsberger (1990) demon-
strated that membrane-form VSG was
transferred to erythrocytes co-cultured
with T. b. brucei. Based on the presence
of VSG in EVs and transfer of EV proteins
to erythrocytes, we asked whether VSG is
present on EV-treated erythrocytes. Immunofluorescence mi-
croscopy showed VSG on the surface of erythrocytes treated
with T. b. brucei EVs (Figure 6A). This result was recapitulated
when erythrocytes were co-incubated with T. b. brucei sepa-
rated in transwells, again consistent with the biogenesis and
fusion of EVs (Figure 6B). Based on these results, we postulate
that fusogenic trypanosome EVs may serve as vehicles for path-
ogen-to-host cell transfer of membrane proteins.
Because EV fusion incorporates exogenous proteins and
lipids into erythrocytes, we investigated whether the physical
properties of the plasma membrane were altered. Human eryth-
rocytes treated with EVs were less sensitive to osmotic lysis (Fig-
ure 6C). To more specifically define the EV-mediated changes to
erythrocyte membranes, we probed plasma membrane lipid
packing. Human erythrocytes incubated with EVs showed an in-
crease in membrane rigidity as indicated by a narrowing and shift
of the emission spectra of Laurdan toward shorter wavelengths
(Figure 6D). Recently, it has been shown that erythrocyte lipid

 composition was altered during trypanosomiasis, and these cells
were preferentially phagocytosed by myeloid cells (Stijlemans
et al., 2015). Incorporating parasite lipid via EV fusion may
explain altered erythrocyte lipid composition.
Trypanosome infection elicits a severe loss of erythrocytes
during acute phase infection that is independent of B cell
response or IgM (Magez et al., 2008). We found that during acute
infection, mice exhibited a level of anemia that correlates to par-
asitemia (Figures 6E and 6F). These data suggested that anemia
during the acute phase was a response to a density-dependent
trypanosome factor. We reasoned that EVs would be present at
concentrations dependent on parasite density, and EV-altered
erythrocytes would be cleared from circulation. To test whether
EV fusion causes clearance, we incubated GFP-expressing
mouse erythrocytes with T. brucei EVs and intravenously in-
jected these cells into naive mice. Similar to human erythrocytes,
EVs fuse with mouse erythrocytes and acquire VSG, lipid,
and increased rigidity (Figures S5A–S5D). Clearance occurred
rapidly, within 1 hr, and the remaining EV-treated erythrocytes
became stable in circulation after 24 hr (Figure 6G). Finally, we
tested whether circulating EVs stimulated a loss of erythrocytes.

sulted in increased erythrocyte volume
(Figure S5E), which may be a conse-
quence of lipid incorporation into the
plasma membrane via EV-fusion, and a
mean 5.3% and 10.6% decrease of
erythrocytes (normalized to control injec-
tions) 1 hr post-injection (Figure 6H).
These decreases correspond to a loss of
3.0 3 108 and 7.1 3 108 erythrocytes in
BALB/C and C57BL/6 mice, respectively.
Greater loss of erythrocytes in C57BL/6 is consistent with more
severe anemia in trypanosome infected C57BL/6 than BALB/c
mice (Magez et al., 2008). These data combined suggest that
the fusogenic properties of trypanosome EVs directly alter the
physical properties of erythrocytes and likely contribute to ane-
mia associated with both cattle and human trypanosomiasis.
Conclusions
It has become increasingly clear that most cells communicate
within their immediate environment by the formation of mem-
brane nanotube-like extensions and by the release of EVs (Remis
et al., 2014; Schorey et al., 2015). Extracellular vesicles derived
from ‘‘donor cells’’ can have profound effects on ‘‘recipient cells’’
by altering gene expression and modulating signaling pathways
resulting in developmental changes and modulation of immune
response. EVs have also been shown to transfer virulence fac-
tors from infectious microbes to host cells, transmit infectious
prion proteins and HIV, and contribute to cancer and cardiovas-
cular disease progression (Fevrier et al., 2004; Zomer et al.,
2015). Here, we report the discovery of EVs formed by the
budding and subsequent vesicularization of long membrane
nanotubes from the flagellum of African trypanosomes. In these

 studies, we observed that T. b. brucei EVs contained several pro-
posed trypanosome virulence factors. Furthermore, we showed
that during co-cultivation EVs from T. b. rhodesiense facilitated
the transfer of the virulence factor SRA to T. b. brucei where it
localized within an endolysosomal compartment and conferred
resistance to TLF. The formation of EVs was enhanced under
stress conditions or with the addition of complement active
serum, and we postulate that EV delivery of virulence factors,
including but not limited to SRA, might be advantageous to the
parasite in immune competent hosts. We also found that
trypanosome-derived EVs are highly fusogenic with mammalian
erythrocytes, resulting in physical changes to the erythrocyte

both human and cattle trypanosomiasis
contributing to pathology and death.
Several proposed T. b. brucei virulence
factors were found in the EV proteome,
including the flagellar proteins GPI-PLC,
calflagins, and metacaspase 4. While
these proteins contribute to parasite viru-
lence, their mechanisms are unknown
(Emmer et al., 2010; Proto et al., 2011;
Webb et al., 1997). We found that nano-
tubes and EVs associated with trypano-
somes have a thick VSG coat consistent with budding from the
flagellar membrane; however, purified EVs have a sparse coat
suggesting activation of the EV-associated GPI-PLC (Figures
2E, S1D, and S1E). This may have implications in fusion of EVs
with target membranes. T. b. brucei EVs also contained a
flagellar adenylate cyclase (GRESAG4) previously proposed to
increase the levels of cAMP in host immune cells, which in turn
activates the host cell protein kinase A (PKA) (Salmon et al.,
2012). The activation of host cell PKA reduced production of
TNF-alpha sparing trypanosomes from host innate immunity
(Salmon et al., 2012). While an appealing model, it was unclear
how trypanosome adenylate cyclase could be transferred to
254
Cell 164, 246–257, January 14, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
 host cells in an active state. Our discovery that highly fusogenic
T. b. brucei EVs contain this enzyme raises the possibility that
transfer of active GRESAG4 via EVs increased the levels of
cAMP in recipient host cells.
The expression of SRA is necessary for human infectivity by
T. b. rhodesiense and can be transferred to T. b. brucei during
sexual crosses of the two subspecies in the tsetse fly vector
(Gibson et al., 2015). This has important implications in the gen-
eration of new genetic variants of human infective trypano-
somes. Parasite co-infection in tsetse flies is dependent on
dual infection of the blood meal from the mammalian host with
the two subspecies. While both T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. brucei
can infect cattle and wild game, it has been largely held that T. b.
brucei cannot infect primates. We have shown that co-culturing
the two subspecies resulted in transfer of SRA to T. b. brucei and
the transmission of nonhereditary resistance to human TLF. This
may have important implications in establishing dual infections in
the tsetse fly and the generation of genetic diversity during epi-
demics of sleeping sickness when humans would represent a
significant reservoir of the parasites.
Anemia is a consistent symptom of human and veterinary
trypanosomiasis and a major cause of morbidity (Naessens,
2006). The role of anemia in the pathology of trypanosomiasis
cannot be overstated, and it has been argued that the ability to
resist anemia is more important for survival and reproduction
than the ability to control parasitemia (Naessens, 2006). A pro-
nounced anemia that is associated with a type 1 inflammatory
response and erythrophagocytosis occurs during the acute
phase of infection, whereas the significant, yet less severe
anemia during the chronic phase coincides with a type 2
macrophage status and presence of the anti-inflammatory cyto-
kine IL-10. The host responses that result in anemia are well-
characterized (Stijlemans et al., 2015). Our studies show that
trypanosome EVs fuse with mammalian erythrocytes and cause
changes to the physical properties of the membrane. We pro-
pose that our animal studies show that these changes lead to
erythrophagocytosis and are the cause of anemia during acute
trypanosomiasis. This discovery opens the possibility of identi-
fying inhibitors of EV fusion with host cells and may lead to devel-
opment of drugs that will spare the host from disease-induced
anemia.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All experiments using human and animals subjects were carried out with prior
approval and oversight by the Institutional Review Board. For detailed proce-
dures, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Trypanosome Cell Culture
Bloodstream form T. b. brucei Lister 427 (MiTat1.2) and T. b. rhodesiense
KETRI2482 were grown in HMI-9 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) (Sigma) and Serum Plus supplement (SAFC Biosciences) in 5% CO2 at
37�C.
Nanotube and Extracellular Vesicle Induction
Production of nanotubes and EVs was stimulated by stressing BF T. brucei
with RNAi against the essential BF protein a-KDE1 or by the addition of com-
plement active FBS (Sykes et al., 2015). In all other experiments, EVs were ac-
quired from trypanosomes grown in heat-inactivated serum or serum-free
conditions (for mass spectrometry).
Extracellular Vesicle Purification
T. brucei was grown in HMI-9 to a density of 1 3 106 cells/ml, and EVs were
purified as previously described with slight modification to the protocol
(Bayer-Santos et al., 2013).
Human Erythrocytes
Erythrocytes were removed by centrifugation, washed, and stored in sterile
PBS with 5% dextrose, 0.5 mM EDTA.
Microscopy
All DIC and immunofluorescence images were acquired with a Zeiss Axio
Observer Z1 as previously described (Sykes et al., 2015).
Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy
BF T. brucei stimulated for the formation of membrane nanotubes were fixed
and images were acquired with a JEOL-JEM 1210 transmission electron mi-
croscope as previously described (Sykes et al., 2015). For SEM, 2.5% glutar-
aldehyde-fixed cells were dehydrated on a 0.22 mm membrane, critical point
dried, sputter-coated with gold, and visualized with a Zeiss 1450EP scanning
electron microscope. Three-dimensional reconstruction of serial TEM sections
was carried out using tools available in the IMOD 4.7 software package
(Kremer et al., 1996).
Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis
The concentration and diameter of freshly prepared EVs from 2 3 108 trypano-
somes was determined by analysis with a NanoSight NS300 (Malvern). Fifteen
hundred frames were acquired at 25 frames per second at 25�C.
SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting
Total cell and purified EV proteins were fractionated by reducing SDS-PAGE
and western blotted as previously described using 5 3 105 BF trypanosomes
or EVs purified from 2 3 106 cells (Sykes et al., 2015).
SRA Transfer Assay
For flow cytometry, T. brucei was incubated with EVs for 1 hr at 37�C. T. brucei,
T. bruceiSRA-Ty, and EV-treated T. brucei cells were chilled washed with 13
PBS, fixed with 0.05% paraformaldehyde, and an aliquot was permeabilized
with ice cold 0.1% Triton X-100. For microscopy T. brucei was incubated
with EVs for 1 hr at 3�C or 30 min at 37�C. ConA was added, and cells were
prepared for fluorescence microscopy.
Overnight Survival Assay
Co-cultured or transwell co-cultured trypanosomes were treated with TLF for
24 hr at 37�C. Trypanosomes were incubated with purified EVs for 1 hr and
then treated with TLF for 24 hr at 37�C. After treatment, surviving cells were
counted by phase-contrast microscopy and compared against non-TLF-
treated cultures.
EV Protein Transfer
Purified EVs were labeled with an Alexa-594 labeling kit (Life Technologies)
and 1 3 107 cell equivalents were added to 1 3 108 T. brucei at 3�C. After
washing, cells were warmed to 37�C and prepared for microscopy (Sykes
et al., 2015).
Membrane Fusion Assay
Vesicle fusion was measured essentially as described by Vidal and Hoekstra
(1995).
Transwell Co-culture
T. brucei was co-cultured with T. brucei SRA-Ty or T. b. rhodesiense in 0.2 mm
transwell culture plates. Cells were co-cultured for 24 hr then split 1/10 and
treated with TLF for an overnight survival assay. For erythrocyte co-culture,
T. brucei was inoculated with mouse or human erythrocytes in transwell plates.
Flow Cytometry Analysis of Lipid and VSG Transfer
After co-culture with trypanosomes, erythrocytes were washed prior to anal-
ysis. Samples analyzed for lipid transfer by R18 staining were directly analyzed
Cell 164, 246–257, January 14, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
255
 while erythrocytes analyzed for VSG transfer were first treated using the pro-
tocol for fluorescence microscopy staining. All samples were then analyzed
using a CyAn ADP Analyzer.
Osmotic Lysis Assay
Freshly collected human erythrocytes were resuspended in PBS and incu-
bated with EVs. Erythrocytes were incubated in NaCl solutions, pelleted and
the absorbance of the supernatant was read. Complete lysis was achieved
by incubation in deionized H2O.
Laurdan Spectral Analysis
Freshly collected human or mouse erythrocytes were resuspended in and
incubated with EVs for 30 min. Erythrocytes were washed, labeled with Laur-
dan for 30 min, washed three times with PBS, and spectra recorded with the
Perkin Elmer Life Sciences LS-55 luminescent spectrofluorometer.
Trypanosome Infections and EV Treatments
Trypanosome infections were initiated by intraperitoneal injection of T. b. bru-
cei Lister 427-221 parasites in retired breeder female BALB/c mice (Jackson
Laboratory). Parasitemias were determined by the matching method (Herbert
and Lumsden, 1976).
For ex vivo EV-treatment, erythrocytes from 10-week-old mice expressing
GFP from a ubiquitin promoter (C57BL/6-Tg(UBC-GFP)30Scha/J) (Jackson
Laboratory) were collected and incubated with or without EVs. Erythrocytes
were injected into the tail vein of naive C57BL/6J mice. Whole blood collected
from the tail vein was analyzed by flow cytometry, and GFP-positive erythro-
cytes were quantified from the ratio of labeled to unlabeled erythrocytes.
For direct EV injections, wild-type BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice were injected
intravenously (tail vein) with EVs freshly prepared in PBS. Control mice were
injected with an equal volume of PBS. Erythrocyte counts were determined
via Coulter counting.
