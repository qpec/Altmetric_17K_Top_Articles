ABSTRACT
It is currently estimated that 11 million Cana-
dians are living with diabetes or prediabetes.
Although
hyperglycemia
is
associated
with
serious complications, it is well established that
improved glycemic control reduces the risk of
microvascular
complications
and
can
also
reduce cardiovascular (CV) complications over
the long term. The UKPDS and ADVANCE
landmark
trials
have
resulted
in
diabetes
guidelines recommending an A1C target of
B 7.0% for most patients or a target of B 6.5% to
further reduce the risk of nephropathy and
retinopathy in those with type 2 diabetes (T2D),
if it can be achieved safely. However, half of the
people with T2D in Canada are not achieving
these glycemic targets, despite advances in dia-
betes pharmacological management. There are
many contributing factors to account for this
poor outcome; however, one of the major fac-
tors is the delay in treatment advancement,
particularly a resistance to insulin initiation and
intensification.

BASAL INSULIN INITIATION
Do We Still Need Insulin?
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive disorder
characterized by multiple pathophysiological
defects. The core defects include insulin resis-
tance in the muscle and liver and impaired
insulin secretion due to b-cell failure [1, 2]. The
progressive nature of the disease is such that it
requires therapy to be intensified over time to
compensate for the ongoing b-cell deficiency
[2–4]. At the time of T2D diagnosis, more than
50% of b-cells have already been lost, and con-
tinue to decline at an average rate of 5% per
year [1, 2, 5]. Therefore, the use of insulin is an
appropriate option at any point in the man-
agement of T2D to replace the insulin that the
pancreas is unable to produce sufficiently [1, 6].
In fact, when the maximum output of insulin
has decreased to 15% or 20% of normal, non-
insulin
anti-hyperglycemic
agents
can
no
longer sustain glycemic control and insulin
supplementation becomes a necessity [5]. The
usual starting point for insulin therapy in T2D is
with basal insulin owing to its simplicity and
lower risk of hypoglycemia [7].
When and in Whom to Initiate Insulin
in T2D
The panel recommendations as to when and in
whom to initiate insulin are summarized in
Table 1.
What are the Barriers to Insulin Initiation?
Clinical inertia, defined as the failure on the
part of the provider to advance therapy when
required, adversely affects timely management
of T2D [9–12]. Insulin is often initiated late in
the course of the disease, after failure with
multiple antihyperglycemic agents, and at gly-
cemic values well above the recommended tar-
gets [11–15]. In Canada, mean A1C levels are
[8.5% and mean diabetes duration is C 9 years
before initiation of basal insulin in T2D patients
[13, 15]. A UK retrospective study of pharma-
cologically treated T2D patients on one, two, or
three oral antihyperglycemic agents reported
that the median time to insulin initiation was
[7 years with an A1C C 7.0% and the mean
A1C levels at initiation was [9.0% [12].
There are many barriers that contribute to
this delay in initiation and intensification of

 insulin in T2D. It is important to emphasize
that many of these barriers reflect the attitudes
and beliefs of both patient and provider. Iden-
tifying
and
addressing
both
provider
and
patient
beliefs
and
attitudes
are
therefore
essential to mitigate those barriers (Tables 2 and
3).
What is Your Role in Insulin Therapy?
Success in overcoming patient barriers relies
greatly on listening to the patient and proac-
tively
addressing
their
fears
and
concerns
[55,
56].
Open
dialogue
with
the
patient
throughout the continuum of diabetes man-
agement, with an emphasis on the positive
benefits of insulin therapy, will significantly
enhance
the
outcomes
for
patients
with
diabetes. See Table 4 for review of action points
with your patient.
BASAL INSULIN DOSE
AND TITRATION
RECOMMENDATIONS
In light of the persistent barriers contributing to
delays in diabetes management with insulin,
there is an urgent need for a simplified and
practical approach to the initiation and inten-
sification of insulin. Complex regimens and
unrealistic targets can worsen the patient’s
engagement in the process and ultimately the
patient’s well-being [3, 4, 57]. Simplification
allows
for
empowerment
by
engaging
the
patient in doable tasks, which provides the
context for behavior shaping (next step goals)
and self-efficacy (confidence in the face of bar-
riers) [58].
What Do We Want in a Basal Insulin
Recommendation?
•
A starting dose that can be safely applied and
individualized.
•
A titration schedule that is simple and can be
safely patient-driven, with a fasting blood
glucose (FBG) target that can be individual-
ized. Patient-driven titration schedules are as
effective as provider-driven titration sched-
ules [19, 59–64] and engage the patient,
which in turn can lower barriers to insulin
therapy [4, 65, 66].
•
Clear instructions to the patient on how the
dose will be titrated, to manage expectations
which
will
empower
the
patient
and
improve adherence to therapy [3, 4, 16, 66].
•
Recognition that insulin initiation and titra-
tion are two separate behaviors for the
patient, each of which needs to be addressed
in relation to patient readiness to change.
How to Select a Basal Insulin?
Three generations of basal insulins are available
in Canada. The first generation of basal insulin
is NPH, a human insulin that has been available

 for many decades, since 1946. The basal ana-
logues (insulins detemir and glargine (Gla-100))
emerged in the 2000s and provided longer
duration of action, improved day-to-day vari-
ability, reduced hypoglycemia, especially noc-
turnal, and did not require resuspension (as
does NPH) [67]. A next generation of long-act-
ing basal insulins—insulins glargine 300 U/mL
(Gla-300) and degludec—have emerged with an
extended action profile, improved safety, and
the advantage of being administered in smaller
volumes [29]. Table 5 summarizes the main
characteristics of the currently available basal
insulins. The panel recognizes that the choice of
basal insulin may depend on access, cost, and
clinical judgment with respect to the patient’s
individual needs and lifestyle [29].
How to Dose?
There
are
several
important
concepts
to
remember when dosing basal insulin: (a) the
starting dose will be wrong; (b) there is no
maximal insulin dose; (c) titration of insulin
dose is the key [8]. Each of these concepts needs
to be explicitly discussed and understood by the
patient in order for titration to be successful.

of
physicians

[3, 11, 16, 17]:
Recognize the low risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain with earlier use of basal
insulin in T2D [18, 19]
Excess weight gain
Hypoglycemia
Impaired quality of life
Recognize the lower risk of hypoglycemia with each successive generation of
basal insulin (human vs analogue vs next generation analogue) [14, 20–32]
Assumptions about patient inability to
use insulin
Assumptions about patient refusal to use
insulin
Discuss with your patient. Do not assume that your patient is uninterested or
non-adherent. Negotiate benefit versus risk or initiation versus inaction
[3, 34]
Awareness that most people can manage their treatment with appropriate
education and support [3, 17]
[3, 11, 17, 33]
Diabetes education and allied support (cognitive behavior therapy and
motivational communication) by healthcare professionals (HCPs) to improve
adherence and health outcomes [16, 33–36]

Concern
Panel recommendations
Fear of needles or apprehension
toward injections
Feeling that insulin is too
complicated
[3, 11, 16, 33, 44]
Demonstrate injection technique: show the insulin pen and small needle tips. Apply the
principles of systematic desensitization (self-controlled exposure)
Highlight that the injection is into subcutaneous tissue, not a vein
Invite patient to try these without insulin, in your office (i.e., dry injection); give first
injection together with patient to observe, support and ensure correct administration of
insulin
Educating on injections: see
http://www.fit4diabetes.com/canada-english/fit-recommendations/
Feeling that this is a personal
failure [3, 11, 16, 33, 45]
Pro-action. Do not wait to talk about insulin once the patient needs insulin. Explain from
the time of diagnosis that insulin is a likely treatment option in the course of T2D [46]
Discuss with the patient, using decisional balance analysis (pros and cons), that need to
advance therapy is due to the progressive nature of diabetes, not because the patient has
done something wrong
Belief that insulin causes
diabetes complications
[3, 11, 16, 33]
Insulin is a natural hormone and a replacement therapy [42]
Explain why insulin becomes necessary for most patients with diabetes eventually; it is not
a punishment [46]
Explain that use of insulin will help achieve glycemic target and minimize the risk of
complications [47, 48]
Concerns over hypoglycemia
(BG\4.0 mmol/L)
[3, 11, 16, 33, 49–52]
Reassure the patient that most hypoglycemic episodes are mild. Severe hypoglycemia
(defined as requiring assistance by another person) is relatively rarea [52] http://
guidelines.diabetes.ca/browse/chapter14;
[53] http://guidelines.diabetes.ca/browse/chapter13; [20, 29, 42, 47, 54]
Educate the patient on how to recognize and respond to symptoms [52] http://guidelines.
diabetes.ca/browse/chapter14
Make sure the patient and partner/family (if applicable) know how to recognize, treat,
and avoid hypoglycemia, and how to self-adjust insulin [34]
Choose insulins and regimens with lower rates of hypoglycemia [14, 29]
Use systematic desensitization to allow the patient to work from a psychologically safe
zone to a medically safe zone
Concerns over weight gain
[3, 11, 16, 33]
Encourage healthy diet and moderate exercise. Monitor weight. http://guidelines.diabetes.
ca/fullguidelines
Combine insulin with metformin or other NIAHA with weight benefit. http://guidelines.
diabetes.ca/cdacpg_resources/CPG_Quick_Reference_Guide_WEB.pdf [14, 29]
Explain that weight gain with basal insulin regimens is small especially with newer basal
insulin analogues (1–2 kg) [14, 20, 26–29, 32]
Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:501–519
505
 ‘‘insulin intensification is an essential element
of diabetes management,’’ 30% of primary care
physicians ‘‘never or rarely’’ personally intensi-
fied insulin (vs 4% of specialists) in the multi-
national survey MODIFY [14, 81]. Interestingly,
in a recent multinational survey, HCPs gener-
ally preferred a gradual and safe approach to
titration
to
avoid
hypoglycemia
whereas
patients are frustrated by time to reach goal
[66]. It is therefore important to manage the
patient’s expectations.
The starting dose for basal insulin recom-
mended by this panel is 10 U/day. The dose
should be incrementally increased on a regular
basis using target FBG as the determinant for
dose
adjustments.
At
initiation,
educating
patients that many people will need at least
40–50 units of basal insulin to achieve target
FBG is useful for goal setting and behavior
shaping. This may help mitigate patient fear/
reluctance to up-titrate [8].

Dose adjustments
Select a simple titration algorithm that matches patient
lifestyle [57]
The following dose adjustment algorithms have been
shown to be safe and effective. Select the one that is
easiest for the patient to follow:
One easy titration algorithm is
1 unit every dayb [19, 63, 64, 66]
Other titration algorithms include:
2 units twice weekly based on lowest fasting SMGB
value of the last 3 days [26, 27, 62, 86]
Every week, based on lowest fasting SMGB value of the
last 3 days [26, 63, 64]
Other considerations:
If (nocturnal) hypoglycemia occurs (BG\4.0 mmol/
L) reduce the dose by 2–4 units, or 10% of the basal
dose based on clinical judgement [57]
For other considerations, see Table 6
Measure glucose level at least every morning before
breakfastc [57]

Question
Answer
Is 4.0 to 7.0 mmol/L too
aggressive?
Depends on individual target and patient characteristics (e.g., younger patient, patient
with established retinopathy/nephropathy, etc.). http://guidelines.diabetes.ca/cdacpg_
resources/CPG_Quick_Reference_Guide_WEB.pdf
Is there a ceiling to titration
process?
There is no such thing as a maximum dose [8]
Consider resuming titration when FBG values are above patient-agreed target for 3
consecutive days; resume 1 unit daily titration unti FBG \7.0 mmol/L is reached
without hypoglycemia
Patient/HCP contact recommended at 7.0 mmol/L
What to do if daytime
hypoglycemia occurs while
on secretagogues?
Dose adjustment of secretatogue and/or basal insulin recommended
If on NPH, consider basal analogue
When is it appropriate to
intensify treatment with
another agent?
When A1C level remains above individual target after 3–6 months despite appropriate
treatment initiation and optimization have occurred or insulin dose is[1.0 U/kg/day.

What to do if sickness occurs?
Normally continue with the usual dose of basal insulin
Test more frequently
If problems eating or hydrating: stop metformin, SGLT2 inhibitor, insulin secretagogue,
ACE inhibitor, ARBs, diuretic, NSAIDs
Use SADMANS http://guidelines.diabetes.ca/browse/appendices/appendix7_2015.
Complete the card (accessed by clicking on the link) and give it to your patient,

Verify if the dosages were modified during the hospitalization. The dosages are often
decreased as the patient eats hospital food, and must often be increased back towards
the previous dosages
What to do if unsure whether
the dose was given?
Do not give the dose if unsure
Test more frequently
If values rise, may consider giving half the dose [88]

Question
Answer
What to do if gave the dose
twice?
Test more frequently
Take extra snack at bedtime
Wake up every 2–3 h to test glucose. If \7.0 mmol/L, take an extra snack [88]
Additional comments:
Check available resources in area:
For example, call a nurse for advice, diabetes educator available for support, a 24 h
pharmacy for a pharmacist’s advice
Phone an ‘‘on-call’’ service and consider referral to ER
What to do if missed a dose?
If\6 h: take usual dose (be aware of potential increase in risk of hypoglycemia with next
injection)
If 6–12 h: take 50% of normal dose
If [12 h: consider omitting dose or give 50% when remember and 50% next dose and
resume as per usual dosing administration schedule [89]
Additional comments
Recall that new long-acting basal insulins provide greater flexibility [24, 86]
Does insulin stacking (build-up
of insulin in the circulation)
occur with the long-acting
basal insulins? [90]
No, there will be a steady state reached. The steady state will take longer to reach the
longer the half-life of the insulin, minimizing the fluctuations in insulin levels [90]
When to consider seeking
support from other HCPs?
[87]
Patient has surpassed 1 U/kg/day of basal insulin without sufficient FBG control
Patient has recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia
Patient lacks engagement in the titration process. It is important to explore reasons for
lack of engagement by screening for diabetes distress
When to refer to a specialist?
[87]
Patient has frequent episodes of unexplained hypoglycemia
Patient experiences complications (allergic reactions, lack of treatment response, edema,
etc.)
A1C level remains above individual target after 3–6 months despite appropriate treatment
initiation and optimization have occurred
At any point when comfort level is exceeded with available resources. It should be openly
acknowledged that if either the patient or provider thinks they are ‘‘in over their head,’’
accessing additional resources is appropriate

 Frequent Questions and What to Do
with Previous Drugs When Initiating Basal
Insulin
Tables 6 and 7 outline some of the frequently
encountered questions and concerns facing
HCPs
when
initiating
and
titrating
basal
insulin.
PATIENT SUPPORT AND MEDICAL
FOLLOW-UP
How to Ensure Success of Basal Insulin
Management?
The success of basal insulin initiation and
titration relies not only on identifying and
addressing the patient and practitioner barriers
but also on contact frequency with the patient.
Post-initiation follow-up may occur by many
means including via phone, text, email (de-
pending on jurisdiction), cloud, or virtual con-
sult. Regular contact presents an opportunity to
provide or revisit diabetes education, to provide
support to patients on how to effectively self-
manage their disease and to identify any causes
of
concern
[3,
34].
Furthermore,
titration
should be revisited when the patient is not
achieving goal, hypoglycemia occurs, or there is
a change in the insulin type or brand (e.g.,
biosimilar) [87].
The panel provides guidelines for medical
follow-up with patients in Box 2.
Table 7 What to do with previous drugs [8, 57, 91, 92]: usually continue all current anti-hyperglycemic agents when
initiating basal insulin

Comments
Metformin
Continued
–
Insulin secretagogues
(meglitinide and sulfonylurea (SU))
Options to continue, reduce,
or stop the
sulfonylurea [7, 8, 93]
Option to continue, reduce,
or stop meglitinide [8]
If SU is stopped or reduced, titration of
insulin is even more important
When stopping SUs:
Patients may need more insulin or go beyond
basal insulin as glucose levels may go higher
As a guideline, stopping SU is equivalent to
about 20 U of insulin. Individual results
necessitate monitoring and titration [94]
TZDs
Usually discontinueda [95]
Due to increased risk of edema and heart
failure with insulin [8, 96]
Incretin agents (GLP-1R agonist, DPP4i)
Continueda [8, 97]
–
SGLT2 inhibitor
Continued
–
GLP-1R glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor, DPP4i protease dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, SGLT2 sodium-glucose co-
transporter 2, TZD thiazolidinedione
a Recommendation to decrease TZDs is not indicated in Canada; linagliptin use with insulin is off-label (Trajenta�)

Educate patient on recognizing,
preventing, and treating
hypoglycemia
If recurrent hypoglycemia occurs, re-
evaluate titration schedule or
reduce dose (frequent, recurrent
hypoglycemia is typically defined as
1–2 lows in 1 week)
CONCLUSION
Several factors underlie the importance of the
initiative put forth by this expert panel: there is
a rising prevalence of diabetes [98]; half of the
T2D population is not at target, among which
61% were receiving insulin therapy [99], sug-
gesting delayed insulin initiation and intensifi-
cation; there are multiple titration algorithms
to choose from which adds to the confusion
and complexity for patients and providers; and
the arrival of new long-acting basal insulins and
other
pharmacological
and
technological
advances that require consideration. This doc-
ument was developed by a multidisciplinary
panel to address frequently asked questions on
insulin initiation and titration, and it estab-
lishes simple and practical guidelines for dia-
betes HCPs for effective initiation and titration
of basal insulin, with the intent that it may
translate to effective glycemic outcomes in
clinical practice.
