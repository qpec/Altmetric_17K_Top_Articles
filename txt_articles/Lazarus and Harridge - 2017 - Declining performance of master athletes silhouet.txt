The graded effects of physical activity/exercise on ageing
Abstract Analysis of world record performances by master athletes suggests an essentially linear
decline with age until around the eighth decade after which performance decline accelerates.
Because these records are obtained from highly trained individuals they can be viewed as being
reflective of the diminution of integrative physiological prowess that occurs solely as a result
of ageing, unaffected by the confounding effects of inactivity. It can also be argued that these

performance profiles mirror and provide an insight into the trajectory of the physiology of the
human ageing process. Here we propose a set point theory that hypothesises that a given threshold
of physical activity is needed to age optimally and to maximise the ‘healthspan’. Exercising at
levels below the set point will result in ageing being contaminated by the unpredictable and
pathological effects of inactivity. Exercise above this threshold stimulates adaptations towards
maximising athletic performance, but is unlikely to have further beneficial effects on health. Thus
the decades-long, controlled diminution in athletic performance, should not be seen as a disease
process. The ageing process is separate from, and independent of, exercise-mediated processes
that maintain or adapt physiological function. Whether an understanding of these mechanisms
will also help uncover mechanisms underpinning the ageing process itself is open to question.
However, any model which does not take into account the effects of activity will not adequately
describe the inherent ageing process.

Introduction
The necessity to be physically active and partake in exercise
inordertobehealthythroughoutthelifecourseisnowwell
established (Booth et al. 2012) and it has been suggested
by many that exercise should now be incorporated into
the armamentarium of medical treatments (Booth et al.
2012; Hallal & Lee, 2013; Pedersen & Saltin, 2015). Indeed,
while population demographics clearly show an increase
in lifespan, for many this is not being accompanied by
equivalentyearsofgoodhealthorconcomitantlyincreased
‘healthspan’(Pierce,2012).Anobjectiveofageingresearch
is not to increase lifespan per se, but to increase the
‘healthspan’ and to compress morbidity in later life (Fries,
1980; Seals et al. 2016). On a population level, ageing
has long been associated with an increase in sedentary
behaviour (Bouchard et al. 1994), but it is clear that
a wide continuum of activity levels exists among older
people. This spectrum ranges from the very sedentary,
as evidenced by prolonged periods of sitting – itself an
independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (Bouchard
etal.2015),throughtoindividualswhomaintainveryhigh
levels of exercise training and are still competitive athletes.
Athletes over 35–40 years of age are usually referred to as
‘master’,‘veteran’or‘senior’athletesandregional,national
and world championship events exist which cater for
the full range of athletic disciplines and exercise types
(track and field, cycling, weightlifting, swimming, etc.).
Aside from their remarkable athletic performances, from
a gerontological perspective, master athletes have been
proposed as being a biological model in which an under-
standing of the physiology of the healthy and inherent
human ageing process can be gleaned (Hawkins et al. 2003;
Tanaka & Seals, 2003; Lazarus & Harridge, 2007).
This short review discusses the contention that the
trajectory of decline in athletic performance reflects
the characteristics of decline in integrative physiological
function that occurs as a result of an optimal and inherent
ageing process. It integrates this concept into a set point
hypothesis that aims to describe how exercise, health and
ageing are interlinked.
Performance and world records
Performance in athletic competitions is arguably the
greatest test of physiological integration, where cardio-
vascular, respiratory, neuromuscular as well as cognitive
systems, to name but a few, must all be coherent (Basset
& Hawley, 2000). Indeed, A. V. Hill (1925) famously
noted that much could be learned about human physio-
logy ‘from the analysis of athletic records and racing’, an
observation that can also be applied to the study of the
physiologyofhumanageing.Inrecentyears,worldrecords
of master athletes have been the subject of detailed study
(Meltzer,1994;Tanaka&Seals,2003;Rittwiggeretal.2009;
Baker & Tang, 2010). Figure 1 shows one example of the
trajectory of decline with age in the current world record
performances in two athletic disciplines – high-power
short-duration sprinting (100 m) and endurance running
(10,000 m). In both events an essentially linear increase
is followed by an exponential rise in performance times
after the seventh to eighth decade. It may be that this
accelerated decline (sometimes referred to as a ‘break-
point’) is simply due to a reduction in the pool of older
competitors. Alternatively, it may reflect a diminution in
the amount and intensity of training (Tanaka & Seals,
2008), or more intriguingly it may reflect the trajectory

of a fading integrative physiological capacity even though
training levels may remain appropriate for age.
These, like many studies of the relationship between age
and physiological function, are cross-sectional in nature
and with a few exceptions (e.g. Hawkins et al. 2001), it
is not possible to chart the decline in performance that
occurs with ageing in a given individual. Furthermore,
distinctions need to be made between exercisers and
athletes (Ara´
ujo & Scharhag, 2016), as well between elite
athletes and elite ‘master’ athletes. The past histories of
master athletes are usually unspecified and the alumni of
master world record holders rarely contain athletes who
were world record holders in their prime.
Despite the deficiencies in cross-sectional data there
are nonetheless some interesting conclusions that can
be drawn from studying the relationship between
performance decline and age. What is especially striking
is that, as mentioned above, the falloff in performance is
not linear, but curvilinear (Baker & Tang, 2010) and with
some exceptions (Senefield et al. 2016), is generally similar
for both men and women (Wiswell et al. 2001). Tanaka &
Seals (2008) suggested that declines with increasing age
in endurance exercise performance and its physiological
determinants, such as maximal oxygen uptake ( ˙
VO2max),
appear to be mediated in large part by a reduction in
the absolute intensity and total volume of training under-
taken. This implies that should the older athletes simply
increase their training load then performance would
increase. This raises an important issue as to the maximum
intensity and volume of training of which an older athlete
is capable. Indeed, it could be argued that older athletes,
particularly at the elite level, are already training at the
maximumcapabilitythattheiragedictatesorallows.Thus,
despite training at reduced absolute levels of intensity and
volume, they may well be training at the same relative level,
normalised in some way for the ageing process. Until data
from longitudinal studies are obtained which determine
the relationship between advancing age and training load
that are appropriate for the age under study this question
remains open. In contrast to endurance events, power
based activities such as 100 m sprint running (Fig. 1B) are
not limited by cardio-respiratory fitness, but essentially by
neuromuscular/muscular–tendinous function (Kohanen
et al. 2009). Here a similar ageing profile is seen for the
age-related declines in world record performances. Whilst
these individuals have training regimens which specifically
target power generation and sprint running speed, the
data suggest that, as for other systems, this decline reflects
an inherent ageing effect. Importantly, whilst these two
examples are from running, the decline in performance
with age is essentially the same among many athletic
disciplines (Baker & Tang, 2010), providing support for
the notion that these curves reflect a profile of inherent
age-related changes in integrative physiological function
that is broadly applicable.
On examining the performance curves there are a
number of points which the above observations do not
address. Master athletes, by exercising, although not
completely free of disease, have avoided most of the
negative effects brought on by inactivity and therefore it is
suggested that these curves represent optimal declinations
in performance that are driven largely by an inherent
ageing process. If so, these curves might suggest that
the ageing process results in a smooth, coordinated
and synchronous reduction in physiological systems
enabling the body to achieve maximum performance
for a given age. When considered in this light it is
worth noting how remarkable the performances of the
oldest master athletes are relative to their age-matched
sedentary individuals, who are often frail with multiple

morbidities. These observations also suggest that this
seemingly age-coordinated diminution of physiological
function during healthy ageing has little resemblance to
a disease process.
Physically active/exercising individuals represent the
optimum phenotype for ageing studies because they
should be free from the negative effects of inactivity
(Lazarus & Harridge, 2010). However, it is clear that
exercise does not halt the ageing process, even though
superior levels of function are achieved by the most active
for a given age. There are two distinct processes that need
addressing; the first is the unfolding of the mechanisms
by which exercise acts as a stimulus to maintain health
and the second is the elucidation of the mechanisms
of the ageing process driving changes in physiological
function. As being physically active is key to health, it
is unfortunate that in most studies of human ageing,
which do not involve athletes, the exercise and/or physical
activity profiles of the subjects are not accorded the
same importance as other lifestyle factors. The result is
that it becomes difficult to unravel the effects of ageing
from those induced by inactivity mediated processes. We
emphasise that during this healthy ageing process exercise
isnottheonlyinfluentialfactor.Otherlifestylefactorssuch
as appropriate diet, lack of smoking and no, or moderate,
alcohol consumption must also be in place.
Some of the reasons for this lack of a clear definition
include the collection of self-reported activity data,
the failure to objectively assess duration, intensity and
frequency, as well as the different types of activities. Unless
and until objective measurements of physical activity are
incorporated into protocols examining the ageing process
in healthy individuals of all ages, incorrect perceptions of
the ageing process will persist.
The nexus between exercise, health and ageing
From an overview of the above limited longitudinal
and extensive cross-sectional data and despite the many
caveats using cross-sectional data for model building,
we put forward the following set point hypothesis. This
model seeks to explain and predict some of the effects
that are the product of an interaction between physical
activity/exercise, age and health. It has been cogently
arguedthatexerciseisintegratedintohumanphysiologyas
part of our evolutionary heritage (Booth et al. 2002). The
set point hypothesis predicts how health, age and exercise
are interlinked. Health here is defined as the state in which
sufficient physical activity/exercise is undertaken in order
to maintain physiological function uncontaminated by
inactivity. Essentially the negative effects of inactivity are
mostly eliminated. The set point might be attained via
different combinations of volume and intensity of physical
activity/exerciseaswellasmode.Therearethreeimportant
physiological scenarios in which to apply the Set Point
Model. The first is an examination of the physiological and
ageing effects of individuals engaging in physical activity
at the set point level. The second are effects on individuals
operating below set point levels and the third are those
individuals who engage in exercise regimens, in which the
amount of exercise is above set point levels, the category
in which master athletes will fall.
Individuals operating at set point levels of physical
activity
Given the heterogeneity of human physiology, the set
point will not be the same for all individuals. Longitudinal
studies are required to determine whether, or the extent
to which, the set point is genetically determined, or is a
product of other factors including the physiognomy of
an individual. Populations or individuals with inherently
lower set points would be able to preserve health at lower
levelsofphysicalactivitycomparedtothosewithhigherset
points. Unlike master athletes, individuals exercising at the
set point will probably not engage in competitive events.
The effects of operating at the set point are depicted in
Fig.2A.Becauseoftheeliminationofinactivity,thedecline
in function is not compromised and only governed by the
inherent ageing process. The effect of this process is for
physiological capacity to ‘shrink’ in a co-ordinated and
controlled manner so that health is preserved through the
decades and as a result, the set point to offset physical
inactivity-mediated pathologies on a shrinking physio-
logy alsodecreases.Atadvancedageinherentphysiological
differences between subjects will probably have been mini-
mised and physical activity levels to maintain healthspan
are likely to be within a narrow range (Fig. 2A). Because
of the compression of the set point, reflecting the reduced
absolute level and range of physical activity necessary to
maintain health, healthy older individuals (e.g. �80 years)
couldbesuggested as themostappropriategroup inwhom
to try and begin to define set point levels.
In the very late decades the amount of physical activity
required to combat the effects of inactivity may not
be readily apparent without objective measurements.
Eventuallyacriticallevelofphysiologicaldeclineisreached
as death approaches, but healthspan is maximised and
morbidity compressed. Importantly, and as previously
emphasised, during this healthy ageing process other
important life style factors (healthy diet, a lack of smoking,
moderate or no alcohol consumption) must also be in
place.
Individuals operating below set point levels
of physical activity
People who have physical activity levels below their set
point will have a compromised physiology because of
the negative and pathology-inducing effects of inactivity

Figure 2. The set point theory of healthy human
ageing
A, at the set point, physical activity/exercise is sufficient
to counteract the effects of inactivity and health is
optimised. The decrement in physiological function that
occurs through the decades is governed by the inherent
ageing process. Because the decrement in physiology
generated by the inherent ageing process is
co-ordinated and integrated, the amount of physical
activity necessary to counter inactivity also concomitantly
decreases. Health is still maintained, but at a lower
physical activity level. This intertwined relationship
between health and the amount of physical activity
necessary to counter inactivity applies throughout the
‘healthspan’ and morbidity is compressed. The green
shaded area depicts the heterogeneity of set points that
could be expected in the general population. B, below
the set point the negative and unpredictable effects of
inactivity on physiological systems may not be perceived
in the early ages, but as age progresses the added
decremental effect of the inherent ageing process on an
increasingly compromised physiology will result in one or
more systems showing clinical disease with extended
morbidity. C, individuals who engage in exercise above
the set point level will also have countered the effects of
inactivity and be inherently ageing. Master athletes will
represent a group that are probably exercising at levels
of exercise that are maximal. When engaged in
competitive events the traditional performance curve will
be produced. The decrement in the performance curve
as age advances is due to the inherent ageing process.
Analogous to the influence of the inherent ageing
process at set point, the ageing process reduces
performance mechanisms that are both co-ordinated
and integrated to deliver maximum performance for a
given age. In later life, where the decline in performance
accelerates, the levels of exercise needed to preserve
maximum performance may now be approaching the set
point level for that age. Individuals exercising below
maximal levels, but above the set point are hypothesised
to generate performance curves of a similar shape, but
at lower absolute performance levels and dependent on
the degree of exercise training.

(Fig. 2B). The diminishing physiology that is determined
by the inherent ageing process will now be influenced by
an interaction with the negative effects of inactivity and
this interaction will be conducive to the production of
those diseases that are related to inactivity.
In the early years the onset of diseases may be incipient
or subclinical, but as age and inactivity interact individuals
are likely to suffer from one or more pathologies. The
onset of morbidity is uncertain and the decline in physio-
logical function is not related to the inherent ageing
process. Other lifestyle factors may also be suboptimal
bringing further medical complications. Importantly, it is
clear that sedentary people who decide to adopt, or who
are prescribed, increased physical activity will benefit in
terms of both physiological function and health status.
The beneficial effects of increased activity at this point
will depend upon numerous factors such as the extent to
which inactivity has decreased physiological function and
the amount of physical activity now undertaken.
Individuals operating above set point levels
of physical activity
Increasing physical activity/exercise above the set point
(for example to target a high level of a specific athletic
performance), will allow adaption of the challenged
physiological systems until maximum levels of exercise
performance are reached (Fig. 2C). Master athletes
are representative of this group and will produce the
documented performance curves illustrated in Fig. 1.
However,animportantaspectofthesetpointmodelisthat
increasing exercise levels above the set point in order to
increase athletic performance will not necessarily improve
health and would be detrimental to health in the case
of overtraining. The diminution in athletic performance
is the result of the inherent ageing process. Although
absolute maximum levels of exercise decrease, they remain
maximal relative to age and still produce maximum
age-related performance. We suggest that eventually in
the final stages of life the levels of exercise necessary to
produce a maximal performance will essentially coincide
with the set point level and individuals will now enter
the compressed morbidity zone. It could be argued that
if age-related performance curves from individuals of
differing ability could be normalised for physiological
differences, they would essentially superimpose. This
controlled and integrated ageing is the same process that
is exerting its effects on those individuals at set point levels
of physical activity (Fig. 2A).
Master athletes compared to other models of ageing
Theliteratureoftheoreticalmodelsthathaveaddressedthe
biology of ageing per se is fairly extensive but explanation
of the process in the context of human physiology remains
elusive (Edelstein-Kechet et al. 2001; Steinsaltz et al. 2012).
Sedentariness has been shown to alter the profiles of nearly
all physiological indices and using the values of these
indices to construct models of ageing will be erroneous.
For example, the widespread theories of mitochondrial
dysfunction or telomere lengths being linked to inherent
human ageing is likely based on values of these indices
being obtained from participants whose physiology is
already compromised by the effects of inactivity or stress
(Werner et al. 2008; Peterson et al. 2012). The free radical
theory of ageing also deserves testing in subjects who are
lifelong vigorous exercisers (Beckman & Ames, 1998).
These theories are best described as hypotheses linking
physiological systems damaged by inactivity to incipient
disease.Oneexampleinsupportofthisconceptisthestudy
by Lanza et al. (2008) who tested the effects of exercise
on two physiological processes that are widely reported
to be due to ageing, i.e. reduced insulin sensitivity and
mitochondrial dysfunction. The exercisers studied had
performed at least 1 h of cycling or running 6 days a
week over the previous 4 years or longer. These subjects
were likely exercising above their given set points and are
representative of an approach that does not need to study
elite athletes in order to investigate the ageing process.
In contrast to the sedentary individuals who, it might be
argued,hadphysicalactivitylevelsbelowtheirsetpoint,no
ageeffectsoninsulinsensitivityormitochondrialoxidative
function were observed in the exercisers.
Human ageing research: an interdisciplinary science
Estes & Binney (1989) wrote about the medicalisation of
ageingandhowthis‘biomedicalisation’sociallyconstructs
old age as a process of decremental physical decline
and places ageing under the domain and control of
biomedicine. In this specialty of biomedicine, a piecemeal
approach has been adopted to diseases of ageing that leads
to the rapid replacement of one disease by another (Gems,
2011). This construction is based on data mostly obtained
from sedentary subjects. However, as Tulle (2008) has
noted, the science of ageing should neither be the property
of biomedicine nor, indeed, become solely the province of
exercise scientists. As discussed, an exercising participant
is the most appropriate in whom the physiology of optimal
ageing should be studied provided that nutritional status
and other important lifestyle and environmental factors
are not confounding influences.
Most of the data in this review could be viewed as an
exercise scientist’s perspective of ageing viewed through
the prism of physical ability. However the fundamental
biological processes underlying human ageing are not
necessarilybeingelucidatedunlessanunderstandingofthe
physiological mechanisms of exercise equate to knowledge
of ageing. There are other factors, such as mind–body
interactions and mechanisms of physiological integration,

that need to be explained. However, it is known that
being physically active enables older people to recover
a sense of physical and mental wellbeing (Tulle, 2008).
We recognise that the end point for all humans is death,
but we question whether that end point must necessarily
be reached via polypharmacy and multiple organ failure.
The pathway from being optimally aged to death may
have a different and better trajectory which includes
an increased healthspan and a compressed end of life
morbidity.
