IMPORTANCE Indoor tanning and sunburns, particularly during adolescence and young
adulthood, increase the risk of developing skin cancer.
OBJECTIVE To examine the trends in the prevalence of indoor tanning and the association
between indoor tanning and sunburn among US high school students.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study pooled and examined cross-sectional data
from the 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey. During 2009, 2011,
2013, and 2015, the overall response rates were 71%, 71%, 68%, and 60%, respectively, and
unweighted sample sizes were 16 410, 15 425, 13 538, and 15 624, respectively. It included
nationally representative samples of US high school students. Data were collected during the
spring semester (January to June) in each survey cycle beginning February 9, 2009, through
June 18, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of indoor tanning in the past year from 2009 to
2015 and its association with sunburn in 2015.
RESULTS Among high school students in the United States, the prevalence of indoor tanning
decreased from 15.6% (95% CI, 13.7%-17.6%) in 2009 to 7.3% (95% CI, 6.0%-8.9%) in 2015.
Decreases in indoor tanning were found among male (from 6.7% in 2009 to 4.0% in 2015)
and female (from 25.4 % in 2009 to 10.6 % in 2015) students overall, non-Hispanic white
(from 21.1 % in 2009 to 9.4% in 2015) and Hispanic (from 8.2% in 2009 to 4.7% in 2015)
students overall, and all age groups. Among non-Hispanic white female students, the
prevalence decreased from 37.4% (95% CI, 33.6%-41.4%) in 2009 to 15.2% (95% CI,
11.7%-19.5%) in 2015. In 2015, indoor tanning was associated with sunburn in the adjusted
model: 82.3% (95% CI, 77.9%-86.0%) of indoor tanners had at least 1 sunburn during the
preceding year compared with 53.7% (95% CI, 48.9%-58.4%) of those who did not engage in
indoor tanning (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite declines in the prevalence of indoor tanning from
2009 to 2015 among high school students nationwide, indoor tanning remains commonplace
among certain subgroups, especially non-Hispanic white female students. Three-quarters of
those who engaged in indoor tanning had experienced at least 1 sunburn. Efforts by the public
health and medical communities are needed to further reduce the prevalence of indoor
tanning and sunburn and thus prevent future cases of skin cancer.

I
ncidence of skin cancer is increasing in the United States.
Each year, an estimated 4.9 million individuals are treated
for skin cancer at a cost of $8.1 billion.1 Intentional expo-
sure to UV radiation from both the sun and indoor tanning is
the most preventable risk factor for skin cancer.2 A substan-
tial portion of lifetime UV exposure occurs during childhood
and adolescence.3 Indoor tanning is associated with an in-
creased risk of skin cancer, particularly among younger users.4
Moreover, the risk of developing skin cancer is strongly asso-
ciated with sunburns during youth.3 Although indoor tanning
is prevalent, especially among young non-Hispanic white fe-
males,itseemstohavepeakedandhasbeguntodecline.5Little
is known about the association between indoor tanning and
sunburn. To address these questions, we used nationally rep-
resentative samples of US high school students to examine
trends in indoor tanning and its association with sunburn.
Methods
We pooled cross-sectional data from the 2009, 2011, 2013, and
2015 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). The YRBS
uses a 3-stage cluster sample design to produce nationally rep-
resentative samples of public and private high school stu-
dents in grades 9 to 12. Each year, YRBS respondents were
asked, “During the past 12 months, how many times did you
use an indoor tanning device such as a sunlamp, sunbed, or
tanningbooth?(Donotincludegettingaspray-ontan).
”In2015,
respondents were asked, “During the past 12 months, how
many times have you had a sunburn? (Count the number of
times even a small part of your skin turned red or hurt for 12
hours or more after being outside in the sun or after using a
sunlamp or other indoor tanning device).” Students com-
pletedtheself-administeredquestionnairesandrecordedtheir
responses directly on a computer-scannable questionnaire
booklet or answer sheet. During 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015,
the overall response rates were 71%, 71%, 68%, and 60%, re-
spectively, and unweighted sample sizes were 16 410, 15 425,
13 538, and 15 624, respectively.
The YRBS protocol was approved by the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention institutional review board. Par-
ticipation in the survey was anonymous and voluntary, and
local parental permission procedures were used. Student
consent was assumed with the completion of the question-
naire. Data were collected during the spring semester (Janu-
ary to June) in each survey cycle beginning on February 9,
2009, through June 18, 2015.
We calculated the prevalence of indoor tanning in the past
year by sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was com-
puted from 2 questions: (1) Are you Hispanic or Latino? (re-
sponse options were “yes” or “no”), and (2) What is your race?
(response options were American Indian or Alaska Native,
Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or other
Pacific Islander, or white). Students could select more than 1
response option for the second question. For this study, stu-
dents were classified as Hispanic/Latino and were referred to
as “Hispanic” if they answered “yes” to the first question
regardless of how they answered the second question.
Becausenon-Hispanicwhitefemalestudentshavethehigh-
est rates of indoor tanning,5 we conducted additional analy-
ses among this population. Logistic regression analyses exam-
ined linear trends in indoor tanning prevalence from 2009 to
2015, controlling for sex, age, and race/ethnicity in the overall
model and for age in the non-Hispanic white female students
model. To examine the association between indoor tanning
and sunburn in 2015, we used multivariable logistic regres-
sion models controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. We
assessed the association between indoor tanning and sun-
burn in the past year with the adjusted Wald F statistic. Data
were weighted to account for school and student nonre-
sponse and oversampling of non-Hispanic black and Hispanic
students. SUDAAN software, version 10.1 (RTI International),
which accounts for weighted data and the complex sample
design of the survey, was used for all data analysis. The level
of statistical significance was set at P < .05. Logistic regres-
sion analyses were used to calculate 2-sided P values.
Results
Indoor Tanning Prevalence, 2009-2015
In 2015, across the United States, 7.3% (95% CI, 6.0%-8.9%)
of students engaged in indoor tanning, a substantial decline
from 15.6% (95% CI, 13.7%-17.6%) in 2009 (P < .001) (Table 1).
From2009to2015,indoortanningdeclinedamongfemalestu-
dents from 25.4% to 10.6% (P < .001) and from 6.7% to 4.0%
(P < .001) among male students. Indoor tanning also de-
creased among all age groups and among non-Hispanic white
(from 21.1% [95% CI, 18.3%-24.2%] to 9.4% [95% CI, 7.5%-
11.6%]) students, non-Hispanic other (from 7.9% [95% CI, 5.2-

Association Between Indoor Tanning and Sunburn
In 2015, across the United States, 55.8% of students (95% CI,

Question What are the trends in the prevalence of indoor tanning
and the association between indoor tanning and sunburn among
US high school students?
Findings This analysis of cross-sectional, nationally representative
data from US high school students found a substantial reduction in
indoor tanning among US high school students from 2009 to
2015. Indoor tanning was associated with sunburn, with
three-quarters of indoor tanners experiencing at least 1 sunburn.
Meaning Public health and medical community efforts are
needed to further reduce the prevalence of indoor tanning and
sunburn and thus prevent future cases of skin cancer.

Discussion
We observed a substantial reduction (53%) in indoor tanning
among US high school students from 2009 to 2015. Approxi-
mately 1.2 million high school students engaged in indoor tan-
ning in 2015, down from an estimated 2.5 million in 2009.
These reductions are encouraging, but more than three-
quarters of those who engaged in indoor tanning also experi-
enced 1 or more sunburns during the same period.
Reductionsinindoortanningcouldbeattributedtoseveral
factors.In2009,followingnumerousscientificpublicationsthat
consistently demonstrated an association between indoor tan-
ningandskincancer,4theWorldHealthOrganization6classified
indoor tanning devices as carcinogenic to humans. In 2010, a

10%excisetaxonindoortanningwasimplemented.In2014,the
US Food and Drug Administration7 reclassified indoor tanning
devicesfromlowrisktomoderateriskandrecommendedagainst
theirusebyindividualsyoungerthan18years.Alsoin2014,The
Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer2 was re-
leased in which reducing the harms from indoor tanning was 1
of 5 strategic goals. Together, these actions could have raised
awareness to the health risks of indoor tanning.
There was a substantial increase in state laws during our
study period that restricted minors from accessing indoor
tanning.8 In 2009, only 5 states had laws that addressed youth
access to indoor tanning. By 2015, 42 states had passed such
laws, including 13 states that prohibit indoor tanning for indi-
viduals younger than 18 years.8 Previous research has dem-
onstrated that states with age restrictions had lower rates of
indoor tanning among high school students.9 In 2015, the Food
and Drug Administration proposed prohibiting minors (<18
years) from indoor tanning. If finalized, the restrictions may
further reduce the prevalence of indoor tanning.10 Given the
variation in current state laws and the proposal by the Food
and Drug Administration, further research is needed to exam-
ine the effects of such policy changes.
Consistent with those of other studies,11 our findings show
thatindoortannersweremorelikelytoexperiencesunburnthan
thosewhodidnotengageinindoortanning,althoughitwasnot
possibleforustodeterminewhetherthesunburnsoccurredbe-
cause of indoor tanning. This association may be related to the
general behavior of indoor tanners. The misconception that
tanned skin (or a “base tan”) provides UV protection and re-
ducestheriskofasunburnbeforeavacationorthesummersea-
son may encourage people to tan indoors.12 In fact, our study
shows that indoor tanning is associated with an increased like-
lihood of sunburn.
Limitations
This study is subject to certain limitations. First, the findings
apply only to youth who attend high school and may not rep-
resent all persons in this age group. However, in 2012, only 3%
ofindividualsaged16to17yearswerenotenrolledinhighschool
orhadnotcompletedhighschool.13Second,indoortanningwas
self-reported, and the degree of misreporting cannot be de-
termined. Although reliability data are not available for the in-
door tanning or sunburn questions, there is evidence of good
test-retest reliability on many other YRBS questions.14 Third,
wewereunabletocontrolforskintype,whichmaypredictsun-
burns; however, we included race/ethnicity as a proxy. Last,
because we used cross-sectional data, we were unable to ex-
amine causation between sunburn and indoor tanning.
Conclusions
Despite declines in indoor tanning, continued efforts are
needed. Public health efforts could help address the miscon-
ceptionthatindoortanningprotectsagainstsunburn.Themedi-
cal community also can play a key role in counseling adoles-
cents and young adults in accordance with the US Preventive
Services Task Force guidelines.15 Reducing the proportion of
youth who engage in indoor tanning and experience sun-
burns presents an important cancer prevention opportunity.
