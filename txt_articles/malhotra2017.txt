IMPORTANCE Trials in patients with hypertension have demonstrated that intensive blood
pressure (BP) lowering reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality but
may increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence and progression. Whether
intensive BP lowering is associated with a mortality benefit in patients with prevalent CKD
remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) to investigate if more intensive compared with less intensive BP control is associated
with reduced mortality risk in persons with CKD stages 3 to 5.
DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Science Citation Index,
Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov electronic databases.
STUDY SELECTION All RCTs were included that compared 2 defined BP targets (either active
BP treatment vs placebo or no treatment, or intensive vs less intensive BP control) and
enrolled adults (�18 years) with CKD stages 3 to 5 (estimated glomerular filtration rate
<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) exclusively or that included a CKD subgroup between January 1, 1950,
and June 1, 2016.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two of us independently evaluated study quality and
extracted characteristics and mortality events among persons with CKD within the
intervention phase for each trial. When outcomes within the CKD group had not previously
been published, trial investigators were contacted to request data within the CKD subset of
their original trials.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE All-cause mortality during the active treatment phase
of each trial.
RESULTS This study identified 30 RCTs that potentially met the inclusion criteria. The CKD
subset mortality data were extracted in 18 trials, among which there were 1293 deaths in
15 924 participants with CKD. The mean (SD) baseline systolic BP (SBP) was 148 (16) mm Hg
in both the more intensive and less intensive arms. The mean SBP dropped by 16 mm Hg to
132 mm Hg in the more intensive arm and by 8 mm Hg to 140 mm Hg in the less intensive
arm. More intensive vs less intensive BP control resulted in 14.0% lower risk of all-cause
mortality (odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.97; P = .01), a finding that was without significant
heterogeneity and appeared consistent across multiple subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Randomization to more intensive BP control is associated
with lower mortality risk among trial participants with hypertension and CKD. Further studies
are required to define absolute BP targets for maximal benefit and minimal harm.

hronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public
health problem, estimated to affect 26 million
Americans and 200 million individuals worldwide.1,2
Persons with CKD are at high risk of cardiovascular
disease (CVD), progression to end-stage renal disease
(ESRD), and all-cause mortality.3 Hypertension is a
well-known risk factor for CVD; therefore, optimal blood
pressure (BP) control is a major clinical and public health
priority.4,5 Over the past decade, several studies and
clinical practice guidelines6-10 have addressed the optimal
BP target in CKD populations, yet consensus remains
elusive. Observational data have demonstrated U-shaped
relationships between BP and mortality risk among those
with CKD.11,12 Clinical trials testing different BP targets in
CKD populations, including the Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease (MDRD)13 and the African American Study of
Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK),14 failed to
demonstrate benefits of BP lowering for slowing down
CKD progression and were underpowered to address CVD
and mortality.
The current Kidney Disease: Improving Global
Outcomes (KDIGO)7 BP guidelines recommend a BP goal
less than 130/80 mm Hg for individuals with CKD and mod-
erate to severe albuminuria and less than 140/90 mm Hg for
those with CKD and albuminuria less than 30 mg/g. The
Eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 8)15
and the 2013 European Society of Hypertension/European
Society of Cardiology Task Force16 affirmed the BP target of
less than 140/90 mm Hg for individuals with CKD and made
no distinction based on the albuminuria level. These
guidelines were published before the Systolic Blood Pressure
Intervention Trial (SPRINT)17 was completed. SPRINT
enrolled hypertensive individuals without diabetes and
with high CVD risk and found a substantially lower CVD risk
and lower all-cause mortality risk in participants treated
to a systolic BP (SBP) target less than 120 mm Hg compared
with less than 140 mm Hg, although they found a significant
excess of acute kidney injury (AKI). Patients with CKD (de-
fined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of
20-59 mL/min/1.73 m2) accounted for approximately 30% of
the SPRINT participants, and the results were similar (no
statistically significant interactions) among those with CKD
compared with their non-CKD counterparts. However,
the trial was not specifically powered to define the risks
and benefits of intensive BP control for those with CKD.
The different definitions and differential reporting of AKI,
CKD progression, and CVD events from previous randomized
clinical trials (RCTs) represent a major challenge to compre-
hensively address these end points in a meta-analysis. In
contrast, mortality is similarly defined across studies and
is virtually always reported because it is an important safety
signal. Mortality also provides a summary estimate of the net
benefits and harms of the intervention. Therefore, our objec-
tive was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of
RCTs to investigate if more intensive compared with less
intensive BP control is associated with reduced mortality risk
in persons with CKD stages 3 to 5.
Methods
Electronic Searches
Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed,
Science Citation Index, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov
electronic database searches were completed from
January 1, 1950, to June 1, 2016, with the following keywords:
randomizedcontrolledtrials,intensivebloodpressuretreatment,
intensive blood pressure control, strict blood pressure treatment,
strict blood pressure control, tight blood pressure treatment, or
tight blood pressure control.18 The clinicaltrials.gov website
wassearchedforrandomizedtrialsthatwereregisteredascom-
pleted but not yet published. The reference articles from
each identified trial were reviewed to identify any additional
relevant studies. No language restrictions were applied. The
literature search was performed according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA)19 statement recommendations (eTable 1 in the
Supplement).
Selection of Studies
Study eligibility was individually determined independently
by 2 of us (R.M. and H.A.N.). Eligible for inclusion were both
open-label and double-blinded RCTs that had adult partici-
pants (≥18 years) with CKD stages 3 to 5, which was defined as
an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 by either the MDRD or
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equa-
tions and had randomized participants to 2 defined BP tar-
gets (either active BP treatment vs placebo or no treatment, or
more intensive vs less intensive BP control). In some
instances, identified trials included persons with CKD, but the
trials had not previously published mortality events within the
CKD subset. In such cases, we contacted the study investiga-
tors and requested data on the number of patients with CKD
enrolled in the trial, the number in each treatment arm, and
the number of deaths that occurred during the active trial
phase. Studies among dialysis patients were excluded.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Demographics, comorbid characteristics, enrollment crite-
ria, BP control targets in each arm, mean reductions in SBP and
diastolic BP, and mortality events were extracted onto stan-
dardized extraction forms. Extracted data were then verified
by another one of us (H.A.N.). For any discrepancies, two of
Key Points
Question Does intensive blood pressure lowering decrease the
risk of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 18 randomized clinical trials
comprising 15 924 patients with chronic kidney disease, more
intensive blood pressure lowering was associated with
significantly lower risk of mortality compared with less intensive
blood pressure control.
Meaning Targeting more intensive blood pressure lowering may
provide a mortality benefit in persons with chronic kidney disease.

 us (R.M. and H.A.N.) met and conferred, and consensus was
reached. The quality and clinical generalizability of each study
were assessed according to the methods based on allocation
concealment, masking (of participants, investigators, and
assessors), intent-to-treat analysis, percentage withdrawals,
and whether withdrawals were adequately described.20
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The mortality
data were obtained during the active treatment phase of each
trial. The mortality events that occurred during extended
follow-up after the active phase of each trial were not in-
cluded.
Statistical Analysis
MortalityoutcomesineachrandomizedBPgroupwerepooled,
and weighted odds ratios (ORs) comparing the lower BP arm
(intensive BP) with individuals randomized to higher BP tar-
gets (less intensive or placebo) and their 95% CIs were calcu-
lated using both random-effects and fixed-effects models. The
influence of individual trials on the pooled effect size was as-
sessed, and a trial was considered to have an excessive influ-
ence if, after its exclusion, the point estimate of the remain-
ing trials was outside the 95% CI of the overall risk estimate.
Heterogeneity was assessed based on I2 test (I2 of 0%-25%
indicates no or mild heterogeneity, 25%-50% indicates mod-
erate heterogeneity, 50%-75% indicates large heterogeneity,
and 75%-100% indicates extreme heterogeneity).20 Sub-
groupanalyseswereperformedstratifiedbytypeofstudy(drug
vs placebo vs 2 defined BP target arms), study trial duration,
inclusion of diabetic patients (yes or no), baseline SBP, level
of achieved SBP during the trial phase, and SBP difference be-
tween the 2 randomized arms. Meta-regression analysis was
performed to assess the association between SBP differences
during the trial phase and mortality risk while adjusting for
baselineSBP.Potentialpublicationbiaswasassessedusingfun-
nel plots. Two-sided P < .05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant for all analyses, including tests for heterogeneity. All
statistical analyses were performed using a software program
(Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, version 2.2.064; Biostat Inc).

Literature Search
The initial search of Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library,
EMBASE,PubMed,ScienceCitationIndex,GoogleScholar,and
clinicaltrials.govelectronicdatabasesbetweenJanuary1,1950,
and June 1, 2016, provided 4416 citations. We reviewed
abstracts and limited this search to a more detailed review of
407 abstracts of studies potentially eligible for inclusion as de-
scribedintheMethodssection.Insubsequentreview,377stud-
ies were excluded because they did not fulfill the inclusion cri-
teria. The remaining 30 studies were reviewed in full text and
identified for meta-analysis (Figure 1). Data elements from 9
trials13,14,17,21-27 were extracted from the publications. One
citation is a previous meta-analysis,21 which was also used to
abstract data. We contacted trial investigators for the remain-
ing trials, and the authors of 9 studies28-36 provided data on the
number of participants with CKD and deaths during the trial
phaseforthe2BParmsforthepurposeofinclusioninthismeta-
analysis. We were unable to obtain mortality data in the CKD
subset from the investigators for the remaining 12 trials.37-48
Therefore, 18 RCTs involving 15 924 participants with CKD and
complete data were included in the meta-analysis (Figure 1).
Study Characteristics
eTable 1 in the Supplement summarizes the main characteris-
tics of the studies included in the meta-analysis. All trials were
of good quality. Each used a parallel treatment group design,
and 15 trials reported adequate methods for random allocation
and concealment of treatment assignment (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). Six trials13,22,26-28,35 had excluded patients with
type1diabetes,whereas3trials14,17,23hadexcludedpatientswith
all forms of diabetes. Thirteen trials13,14,17,22-25,31-36 among the
18had2definedBPtargets,andtheremaining5trials26-30evalu-
ated a BP-lowering intervention vs no treatment or a placebo
arm.Onetrial36had3definedBPtargets.Forthepurposeofthis
meta-analysis, the lowest BP target group was compared with
the other 2 groups together. The BP targets varied across trials
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). The mean (SD) baseline SBP was
148 (16) mm Hg in both the intensive and less intensive arms.
ThemeanSBPdecreasedby16mmHgto132mmHginthemore
intensive arms and by 8 mm Hg to 140 mm Hg in the less inten-
sive arms. The median follow-up period was 3.6 years (inter-
quartile range [IQR], 2.8-4.9 years). The median difference in
SBP achieved across arms13,14,17,22-36 was 10 mm Hg (IQR,
4-12mmHg),withamedianof130mmHg(IQR,125-141mmHg)
in the more intensive arms vs 138 mm Hg (IQR, 134-146 mm Hg)
in the less intensive arms. The renal inclusion and exclusion
criteria varied across trials and are summarized in eTable 1

pared with the less intensive BP arm. The results were similar
with the fixed-effects model. None of the individual trials had
an excessive influence on the pooled effect size. There was no
evidence of heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 0%, P for hetero-
geneity = .77).Funnelplotanalysisrevealednoevidenceofpub-

The observed effect of those randomized to the more inten-
sive BP arm on mortality was consistent irrespective of the
following: type of treatment in the comparator arm (placebo
or less intensive BP target), median follow-up duration (<3 vs
≥3 years), inclusion of diabetic patients (yes or no), CKD
severity (serum creatinine level <2.0 mg/dL or creatinine clear-
ance >30 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs serum creatinine level ≥2.0 mg/dL

liter, multiply by 88.4; creatinine clearance to milliliters per
second per meter squared, multiply by 0.0167.) In the trials
that achieved a difference in SBP of at least 12 mm Hg, the OR

Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 RCTs among
15 924 participants with both hypertension and an eGFR less
than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 randomized to more intensive vs less
intensive BP lowering, those randomized to more intensive BP
lowering had 14.0% lower risk of all-cause mortality. We ob-
served a suggestion of a mortality benefit in studies that
achieved the greatest difference in SBP between the 2 treat-
ment arms (P = .06). These findings add to the body of evi-
dence that may inform public health policy, clinical guideline
development,andindividualpatientcareinpatientswithCKD.
A prior meta-analysis49 found beneficial effects in per-
sons randomized to more intensive BP lowering on CVD events
among patients with CKD (26 trials among 30 295 partici-
pants; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90). Cardiovas-
cular disease events are important and are the major cause of
death in those with CKD. However, we evaluated all-cause
mortality because it balances the competing risk of multiple
clinical outcomes and because it is a “hard” outcome
assessed similarly across studies. For example, if more inten-
sive BP lowering leads to higher risk of AKI and CKD progres-
sion but lower risk of CVD events, these outcomes could off-
set one another, with no overall effect on all-cause mortality.
This consideration is particularly important in persons who
have CKD at baseline. Less residual kidney function may make
participants with CKD particularly vulnerable to additional in-
sults, resulting in loss of kidney function, as has been re-
ported in clinical trials17,50 evaluating intensive BP control.
WhilemoreintensiveBPcontrolappearstoacutelylowereGFR,
the significance of this finding in patients with CKD remains
uncertain. A recent study51 among AASK and MDRD trial par-
ticipants showed that a 5% to less than 20% acute decline in
the eGFR in the intensive BP arm was not associated with
higher risk of ESRD (adjusted HR [aHR], 1.19; 95% CI, 0.84-
1.68 in the AASK and 1.08; 95% CI, 0.84-1.40 in the MDRD).
However, a similar change in the less intensive arm was asso-
ciated with ESRD (aHR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.30-2.57 in the AASK and
1.62; 95% CI, 1.25-2.11 in the MDRD). Therefore, the results of
our meta-analysis suggest that more intensive BP control may
provide more benefit than harm in persons with CKD.
Approximately 30% of the SPRINT participants had CKD
at baseline.17 The primary end point of SPRINT was a compos-
ite CVD end point. While the P value for interaction for the pri-
mary CVD end point comparing those with and without CKD
was not statistically significant (P = .36), the effect estimate
wassmalleranddidnotreachstatisticalsignificanceintheCKD
subgroup for the primary CVD end point (HR, 0.82; 95% CI,
0.63-1.07). Moreover, intensive BP control resulted in higher
risk of a 30% decline in the eGFR among those without CKD,
as well as more rapid loss of the eGFR, and greater AKI events
in the SPRINT participants both with and without CKD at base-
line. In SPRINT, those with CKD randomized to the intensive
BP-lowering arm had a statistically significant reduction in
all-causemortality(HR,0.72;95%CI,0.52-0.98;P = .04).How-
ever, the total number of deaths in the SPRINT CKD subgroup

 was low (70 deaths among 1330 individuals in the intensive
BP group vs 95 deaths among 1336 individuals in the stan-
dard treatment group), and the trial excluded persons with
diabetes, proteinuria greater than 1000 mg/g, and prior stroke.
It was unknown whether the results generalize to other sub-
sets and whether the mortality benefit observed in the SPRINT
participants with CKD was reproducible. The present meta-
analysis extends these findings and provides additional
assurance in a larger study sample and across different set-
tings. Overall, we found little heterogeneity across studies and
a similar mortality benefit in persons treated with more inten-
sive BP lowering.
The highest mortality benefit was observed in studies that
achieved the greatest difference in SBP during the trial, a re-
sult that did not reach statistical significance (P = .06 for het-
erogeneity).These data will need to be reevaluated when ad-
ditionaltrialsevaluatingintensiveBPcontrolamongthosewith
CKD are completed. Nonetheless, this preliminary finding sup-
portsouroverallconclusionthatmoreintensiveBPcontrolmay
be beneficial for individuals with CKD. The size of the mortal-
ity reduction in patients with CKD (14%) is similar to the per-
centages (9% and 11%) calculated in recent meta-analyses52,53
of all BP-lowering trials, and this result suggests that the ben-
efits of BP lowering on all-cause mortality do not differ sub-
stantially in the presence or absence of CKD.
The findings of this meta-analysis may have implications
tobothclinicalpracticeandpublichealthpolicy.Relativetopub-
lic policy, the KDIGO Blood Pressure Work Group54 announced
that they have convened a panel of experts to review evidence
and potentially modify their guideline recommendations re-
garding appropriate BP targets in patients with CKD. The
present meta-analysis may provide useful data for the upcom-
ing guideline review. Our results may also offer additional in-
formation for patients and health care professionals and may
beusefultoguideshareddecisionmakingabouttherelativerisks
and benefits of BP lowering among those with CKD.
Strengths and Limitations
This study has several strengths. First, multiple high-quality,
methodologically rigorous randomized trials had not previ-
ouslyreporteddifferencesindeathratesacrosstreatmentarms
in persons with prevalent CKD. Among the 18 trials included
in this meta-analysis, investigators from 9 trials reevaluated
their data within the CKD subset and provided data specifi-
cally to support this study. Therefore, our meta-analysis
provides a substantial new evidence base about the risks and
benefitsofintensiveBPloweringinpopulationswithCKD.Sec-
ond, we assessed mortality as a hard clinical outcome, which
has obvious clinical importance, is similarly ascertained across
studies, and is thus largely free of bias. Third, we restricted our
analysis to outcomes that were assessed during the trial phase
of each study only and excluded events that occurred during
long-term follow-up. While there is important information ob-
tainedinsuchfollow-up,55,56BPcontroloftenapproachedsimi-
lar levels across treatment arms after the trial phase.55
Ourstudyalsohasimportantlimitations.First,despitecon-
siderable efforts to contact investigators, we were not able to
obtain data on mortality in persons with CKD in several prior
clinical trials. Therefore, these trials were excluded by neces-
sity.Amongthe18studieswithalmost16 000participantswith
CKD, we found no evidence of heterogeneity. This observa-
tion provides confidence, although not certainty, that the re-
sults would likely have been similar with the inclusion of ad-
ditional studies. Second, we lacked data by severity of CKD and
thus could not evaluate the effect of more intensive BP low-
ering on mortality stratified by CKD severity. Most individu-
als in the included trials had CKD stage 3, and we acknowl-
edge that the risks and benefits of more intensive BP lowering
may differ in persons with more advanced CKD. Third, base-
line BP and the intensity of BP reduction in the randomized
treatment arms differed across the individual trials. As such,
we are not able to provide an estimate of an optimal BP target
in patients with CKD. We recognize that CVD events, CKD pro-
gression, AKI, and ESRD are important factors that may be in
the causal pathway between more intensive BP lowering and
mortality and were not able to assess these end points.
Conclusions
Among trial participants with hypertension and an eGFR less
than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, randomization to more intensive BP
lowering was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality.
This finding was consistent across trials, with no evidence of
heterogeneity. A nonsignificant suggestion of greater mortal-
ity benefit was observed in trials that achieved the greatest dif-
ference in SBP across arms. Although additional studies and
intensive monitoring for safety are warranted, these data sup-
port that the net benefits may outweigh the net harms of more
intensive BP lowering in persons with CKD.
