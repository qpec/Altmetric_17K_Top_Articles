Abstract: Background: The role of the operating room's (OR) ventilation 
system in the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) is widely 
discussed and the existing guidelines do not reflect the current 
evidence. In this context, laminar airflow (LAF) ventilation was compared 
with conventional ventilation to assess their effectiveness in reducing 
the risk of SSI.  
 
Methods: Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
and WHO regional medical databases were searched from 1990 to 31 January 
2014. The search was updated for Medline for the time period between 1 
February 2014 and 27 May 2016. GRADE methodology was used to assess the 
quality of the retrieved evidence. Meta-analyses of available comparisons 
were performed using RevMan 5.3. 
Findings: The search identified 1947 records of which 12 observational 
studies were identified comparing LAF ventilation with conventional 
turbulent ventilation in orthopedic, abdominal, and vascular surgery. The 
meta-analysis of eight cohort studies showed no difference in risk for 
deep SSIs following total hip arthroplasty (THA, 330 146 procedures; odds 
ratio (OR) 1·29, 95% CI 0·98-1·71, p=0·07; I²=83%). For total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA, 134 368 procedures) the meta-analysis of six cohort 
studies showed no difference in risk for deep SSIs (OR 1·08, 95% CI 0·77-
1·52, p=0·65; I²=71%). For abdominal and open vascular surgery the meta-
analysis of three cohort studies found no difference in risk for overall 
SSI (OR 0·75, 95% CI 0·43-1·33, p=0·33; I²=95%) 
Interpretation: The available evidence shows no benefit for LAF compared 
with conventional turbulent OR ventilation in reducing the risk of SSI in 
THA, TKA and abdominal surgery. Decision makers, medical and 
administrative, should not choose to install and use LAF equipped ORs as 
a preventive measure to reduce the risk of SSI.

Background: The role of the operating room’s (OR) ventilation system in the prevention of 
surgical site infection (SSI) is widely discussed and the existing guidelines do not reflect the 
current evidence. In this context, laminar airflow (LAF) ventilation was compared with 
conventional ventilation to assess their effectiveness in reducing the risk of SSI.

Introduction 
 
Surgical site infections (SSI) range between the leading and the second most frequently 
reported health care-associated infections worldwide and are associated with increased 
morbidity, length of hospitalization and costs.1-5 The role of the operating room’s (OR) 
ventilation system in preventing SSI has been discussed for many decades.6  
Numerous studies have demonstrated a reduction of air contamination associated with the use 
of laminar airflow (LAF), often referred to as “ultraclean ventilation (UCV)”, systems 
compared with other types of OR ventilation assessed by bacterial and particle counts.7-11 
However, there is recent evidence that air contamination might not be associated with wound 
contamination.7 Even more important, the association of microbial air contamination with SSI 
has not been demonstrated so far. In some countries terminal high efficiency particulate air 
(HEPA) filters are recommended for LAF only.12,13 In other countries their use is  
recommended for conventional ventilation systems as well based on national regulations or 
technical standards.14   
The keystone study investigating the impact of OR ventilation systems on SSI was conducted 
from 1974 to 1979 in the United Kingdom and Sweden.15 The investigators found a 
significant reduction of deep SSI rates in total hip (THA) and total knee arthroplasties (TKA) 
associated with the use of UCV in the OR in comparison with procedures performed in 
conventionally ventilated ORs. The use of body-exhaust suits was left to the discretion of the 
surgical team. Is not clear, if the “modern positive-pressure air supply” of the ORs in the 
control group of the study compares with conventional turbulent ventilation systems used in 
ORs today. Furthermore, there was no uniform method for random allocation and the study 
did not control for the administration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP) which was 
given in about 60% of cases. From 1974 to 1985, a non-randomized single centre study 
comparing the association of LAF in a tent-like enclosure within the OR and HEPA-filtered 
conventional ventilation on the deep SSI rate after various arthroplasties, mainly THA, found 
no difference in risk.16 SAP, which was introduced in this hospital in 1979, resulted in a 
significant decrease in SSI rate in both settings. The first published study in which patients 
were randomized to ORs equipped with horizontal LAF or to conventional airflow and in 
which all patients received appropriate SAP was conducted from 1981 to 1990.17 The 
investigators found no difference in risk of deep SSI following THA and TKA.   
A systematic review published in 2012 on the influence of LAF on prosthetic joint infections 
found LAF ventilation to be a risk factor for the development of a severe SSI.18 There are 
only a few current guidelines that have provided recommendations regarding ventilation 
systems in the OR. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
guidelines for environmental infection control in healthcare facilities issued in 2003 offer no 
recommendation for performing orthopedic implant operations in ORs supplied with LAF due 
to lack of evidence.19 The SSI prevention guidelines published by the Society for Healthcare 
Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 
2014 recommend to follow the American Institute of Architects’ recommendations for proper 
air handling in the OR.20 The Royal College of Anaesthetists guidelines for the provision of 
anaesthesia services issued in 2016 recommend to perform major joint replacements in an OR 
 page 4 of 18 
 
with multiple air changes per hour, not necessarily equipped with laminar flow, to reduce the 
risks of wound infection.21  
The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of ventilation systems in 
the OR on the prevention of SSI. In this context, LAF ventilation was compared with 
conventional ventilation in any type of surgery. This review has been performed within the 
framework of developing the WHO Global Guidelines for the Prevention of Surgical Site 
Infections issued 2016. 
 
 
Methods 
Search strategy and selection criteria 
To evaluate the evidence on this topic, literature was examined according to a predefined 
PICO question. 
 
1. Is the use of laminar airflow in the OR associated with the reduction of overall or deep 
SSI? 
 
 Population:  inpatients and outpatients of any age undergoing surgical operations  
(any type of procedure)  
 Intervention: LAF ventilation system in the OR 
 Comparator:  normal/conventional ventilation system 
 Outcomes:  
SSI, SSI-attributable mortality 
 
OR ventilation systems without LAF technology were considered as comparator. In most of 
the cases these would be classified as conventional, ordinary, mixed or tubulent ventilation 
systems with or without HEPA-filtered air. Superficial, deep and overall SSI were considered 
as outcomes. SSI referred to in primary studies as severe SSI, periprosthetic infection, (deep) 
infection requiring revision were considered as deep SSI. The following databases were 
searched: Medline (PubMed), Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and WHO regional medical databases. A 
comprehensive list of search terms, i.e. “ventilation”, “surgical wound infection”, “operating 
rooms” was used, including Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) (appendix, page 1). The time 
limit for the review was between 1 January 1990 and 31 January 2014. The search was 
updated for Medline (PubMed) for the time period between 1 February 2014 and 25 May 
2016. Language was restricted to English, French, German, and Spanish. Two independent 
reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of retrieved references for potentially relevant 
studies. The full text of all potentially eligible articles was obtained and then reviewed 
independently by two authors for eligibility. Exclusion criteria were studies not relevant to the 
PICO question, studies not in the selected languages, studies published before 1 January 1990 
or after 25 May 2016, meeting or conference abstracts and studies of which the full text was 
not available for review. Reference lists of all reviewed studies as well as of literature reviews 
were systematically screened for further eligible publications. Authors were contacted, if the 
full text article was not available or if important data or information on the paper’s content 
was missing. Duplicate studies were excluded. We report this systematic review and meta-
analysis in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The PRISMA flow diagram was used to demonstrate the 
study selection process22 (figure 1). 
 
Data analysis 
 page 5 of 18 
 
The two authors extracted data in a predefined evidence table including the following 
information: year of publication, study design, setting, scope, location, population, type of 
surgery, SSI definitions, statistical methodology and limitations (appendix, page 3) and 
critically appraised the retrieved studies. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa 
Quality Assessment Scale for cohort studies23 (appendix, page 18). Any disagreements were 
resolved through discussion or after consultation with the senior author, when necessary. 
Meta-analyses of available comparisons were performed using Review Manager version 5.3 
as appropriate.24 Crude estimates were pooled as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) by use of a DerSimonian and Laird random effect model for each comparison25 
(appendix, pages 19-24). Sensitivity analyses were completed to test the robustness of our 
findings. Heterogeneity among studies was tested using the inconsistency index (I²).26 Funnel 
plots were created to assess whether publication bias occurred27 (appendix, pages 19,21,23). 
The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) 
methodology (GRADE Pro software) was used to assess the quality of the body of retrieved 
evidence as appropriate28,29.

Results 
The initial search identified 1947 records. After removal of duplicates and screening, 109 
articles were assessed for eligibility. Finally, 12 observational cohort studies30-41 comparing 
LAF with conventional ventilation in the OR were identified. Most investigators described the 
ventilation system used in the control group as “conventional (plenum)” or “ordinary” 
ventilation system,30,32,36,39,40 while others reported the use of “conventional turbulent 
ventilation with HEPA-filtered air”.31,37,38 In four studies, investigating THA34 and TKA35,41 
performed in the USA between 2000 and 2009 and gastric surgery33 performed in the 
Republic of Korea between 2010 and 2011, the authors did not provide additional information 
about the ventilation system of the ORs without LAF. These studies were included after 
discussion. No randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included. The populations studied were 
mostly adult patients. Most studies focused on THA (330146 procedures) or TKA (134368 
procedures; table 1). One small study on hemiarthroplasty of the hip was included with 
studies on THA because the procedures are similar.40 Single studies were identified for 
abdominal and open vascular surgery30,31,33 (table 2). All studies on THA and TKA 
investigated deep SSI. Two studies assessed the overall (superficial and deep) SSI rate as 
well.31,37 We considered deep SSI as the critical outcome for further analysis. Brandt and 
colleagues reported on overall and deep SSI for abdominal surgery.31 Two studies on gastric 
and vascular surgery assessed the overall SSI rate.30,33 We considered overall SSI as the 
critical outcome in abdominal and open vascular surgery. 
The following comparisons were evaluated: 
1. LAF ventilation vs. conventional ventilation  
a. in THA  
 page 6 of 18 
 
b. in TKA 
c. in abdominal and open vascular surgery 
Some of the 12 studies provided data for more than one comparison. We identified eight 
observational studies 31,32,34,36-40 comparing the association of LAF ventilation and 
conventional ventilation on the deep SSI rate after THA. Three large multicentre studies 
based on data obtained from national joint registries and surveillance systems found that LAF 
was associated with a higher risk of deep SSI31 and revision due to infection,32,39 whereas one 
small single centre study found LAF to be associated with a decreased risk of revision due to 
infection.40 The four other studies showed no difference in the risk of deep SSI 34,37,38 or 
revision due to infection 36 (table 1).  
We identified six observational studies 31,35,37-39,41 comparing the effect of LAF ventilation vs. 
conventional ventilation on the rate of SSI after TKA. One multicentre joint registry study 
found LAF to be associated with an increased risk of revision due to infection.39 Five studies 
found no difference in the risk of deep SSI31,35,37,38,41 (table 1). One study comparing the 
association of large LAF ceilings with at least 3.2 m² in size and conventional ventilation on 
the deep SSI rate after THA and TKA found no difference in the risk of deep SSI.38  
The meta-analyses found that LAF ventilation did not reduce the SSI rate when compared 
with conventional ventilation in THA (OR 1·29, 95% CI 0·98–1·71, p=0·07; I² = 83%; table 
3; appendix, page 19) or TKA (OR 1·08, 95% CI 0·77–1·52, p=0·65; I² = 71%; table 4; 
appendix page 21). The quality of the evidence for these comparisons was very low due to 
inconsistency shown by high I² values (appendix, page 25).  Publication bias was not 
detected. Kakwani and colleagues seem to have reported a small study with a large effect 
(appendix, pages 19, 21).  
In a sensitivity analysis we compared the overall effect of the included studies with or without 
the studies that did not provide additional information about the ventilation system of the ORs 
without LAF. There was no difference in the results, if the studies were included or not. When 
excluding the study by Namba and colleagues34 for THA, the OR was 1·33 (95% CI 0·97–
1·82, p=0·08; I² = 85%; appendix, page 20) and 1·11 for TKA when excluding the studies by 
Namba and colleagues35 and Miner and colleagues41 (95% CI 0·68–1·83, p=0·68; I² = 75%; 
appendix, page 22) 
Concerning other types of surgery, only three single observational studies on abdominal and 
open vascular surgery were identified with a SSI outcome30,31,33 (table 2). With regard to this 
very limited evidence per type of procedure and outcome, the reviewers agreed not to 
separately assess the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. LAF was found to be 
associated with an overall increased SSI risk following appendectomy in one observational 
study.31 The same study found no difference in overall risk of SSI in colon surgery,31 
cholecystectomy,31 and herniorrhaphy in multivariable analysis.31 In gastric 33 and open 
vascular surgery 33 the absence of laminar flow was found to increase the overall risk of SSI. 
The meta-analysis found that LAF ventilation did not reduce the SSI rate when compared 
with conventional ventilation after abdominal and open vascular surgery (OR 0·75, 95% CI 
0·43–1·33, p=0·33; I² = 95%; table 5; appendix, page 23). In a sensitivity analysis we 
 page 7 of 18 
 
compared the overall effect of the included studies with or without the study that did not 
provide additional information about the ventilation system of the ORs without LAF.33 There 
was no difference in the results, if the study was included or not. However, the effect estimate 
shifted in the favour of conventional ventilation (OR 1·10, 95% CI 0·72–1·68, p=0·66; I² = 
91%; appendix, page 24). Publication bias was not detected. With only few studies included, 
the interpretation of the funnel plot is very limited but there seems to be a lack of small to 
medium-sized studies showing no effect or an effect in favour of conventional ventilation 
(appendix, page 23). 
Finally, four additional single centre studies were identified with combined interventions. 
LAF in combination with behavioral changes in the OR discipline code,42 closed OR doors 
(vs. open doors in the control group),43 and wearing of body exhaust gowns 44,45 in 
THA/TKA, cardiac surgery with sternotomy, and spine surgery, respectively. As these studies 
had additional interventions and were compared with conventional ventilation without the 
same additional measures, they were excluded from further assessment. One randomized trial 
comparing the association of horizontal LAF ventilation and conventional ventilation on the 
deep SSI rate after THA and TKA was excluded after discussion as the entire study period 
was before 1990.17 This trial found no statistically significant difference in the deep SSI rate 
after THA and TKA. One large multicentre joint registry study reporting on the comparison of 
LAF with “ordinary” ventilation in THA was excluded as missing primary data could not be 
retrieved from the authors upon request.46 The investigators described that they did not detect 
any difference in relative risk of revision due to infection. 
The literature search did not identify any studies that reported on SSI-attributable mortality. 
The updated search covering the time period between 1 February 2014 and 25 May 2016 did 
not identify any further eligible studies for this PICO question.  
 
The individual cohort studies included in the systematic review had Newcastle-Ottawa 
Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) scores ranging from 5 to 8 out of 9 possible items 
(appendix, page 18).  
 
Discussion 
The main finding of this systematic review and meta-analysis is that LAF ventilation does not 
reduce the risk of deep SSI after THA and TKA compared with conventional OR ventilation. 
The odds for developing a deep SSI following THA are even higher under LAF condition, 
although this effect was not significant. The evidence is more limited for other procedures, 
but it seems that LAF does not reduce the risk of overall SSI after abdominal and open 
vascular surgery as well. The findings of our meta-analysis are consistent with the results of 
previous literature reviews,18,47,48 adding many more studies to the body of evidence. This 
meta-analysis had some limitations. First, most data were obtained from national surveillance 
systems and registries. Although surveillance databases and registries often provided large 
sample sizes, these databases were not designed specifically to address whether LAF systems 
decrease the risk of SSI. Surveillance databases and registries may not include data on 
possible confounders related to risk factors and the infection rate, such as smoking, obesity, 
 page 8 of 18 
 
intraoperative temperature, glycaemia or cautery. More important, some studies did not 
provide information on the ventilation systems used in the ORs without LAF.33-35,41 We 
decided to include them after discussion. In a Korean study, 26% of the ORs in the control 
group were equipped with HEPA filters. Furthermore, we believe that, in the USA, THA and 
TKA were performed in conventional ORs if not in ORs equipped with LAF. Corresponding 
recommendations on OR ventilation had been issued before the study periods.13 In sensitivity 
analysis, there was no difference in the results, if the studies were included or not. Second, 
because data from a surveillance database and a registry are submitted by numerous hospitals. 
Differences in hospital or surgeon volume, patient characteristics or implementation of other 
SSI prevention measures may confound the results. Third, the definitions for severe SSI 
differed across the individual studies. Fourth, the meta-analysis evaluated crude data from the 
primary studies. For example, crude data from two multicentre studies (N=80756 and 
N=3088) indicated that LAF was associated with decreased risk of deep SSI. In contrast, the 
published adjusted and multivariable analyses did not find a difference in risk.36,37 Overall, 
these factors led to considerable heterogeneity found in the statistical testing indicted by an I² 
of 83% for comparison 1a, an I² of 71% for comparison 1b, and an I² of 95% for comparison 
1c  (appendix, pages 19,21,23). Results from the studies that reported a benefit from LAF 
ventilation may have been biased because the SSI rate in the control group was quite high and 
almost all operations were performed in ORs with LAF ventilation (N=1919, control: 
N=172),33 or the study size was small (N=435 and N=170)30,40 and the case mix was 
heterogeneous.30 We excluded studies that were published before 1990. After discussion we 
excluded a study because its entire study period was before 1990.17 This time limit is 
arbitrarily set and debatable. We considered the ventilation systems used before 1990 might 
not technically compare with the ventilation systems used in hospitals today for orthopedic 
implant surgery. Furthermore, not only OR ventilation technology has improved over the last 
20 to 30 years but the use of SAP has become a standard practice. After the study published 
by Lidwell and colleagues in July 1982,15 there are only two further studies published, 
covering the time period from 1974 to 1990, and investigating the association of LAF 
ventilation and conventional ventilation with the deep SSI rate after THA and TKA.16,17 They 
found no difference in risk. Inclusion of the studies would not have changed the findings and 
conclusion of this review. Unfortunately, the current version of the NOS does not provide a 
threshold score, which substantially limits its ability to differentiate between studies with 
good quality and those with poor quality.  
The concept of creating a clean, particle-free zone by ultra-clean, low-turbulence 
displacement flow originated from a need for a clean environment for industrial 
manufacturing. However, during surgical procedures several forces and obstacles disrupt the 
airflow limiting the effectiveness of this intervention. For example, obstacles such as lights, 
personnel, and instruments create a turbulent reverse flow on their lee sides, heat emitting 
operating lights, heating devices, and the body heat from the OR personnel create thermal 
convection currents, and ventilation exhausts from medical equipment such as saws or drills, 
all disrupt the laminar airflow. In addition OR personnel and medical devices disburse 
airborne microorganisms and particles. Consequently the OR air around the open surgical 
field is not particle-free.49-53 Furthermore, the fresh air from a LAF system cools the surgical 
wound and the patient, which can lower tissue temperatures in the surgical wound or cause 
 page 9 of 18 
 
systemic hypothermia, if the patient’s temperature is not monitored and maintained 
intraoperatively. A recent study found that the odds of becoming hypothermic were 1·53 
(95% CI 1·19–1·96) for patients whose procedures were done in LAF rooms compared with 
patients whose procedures were done in traditional ORs.54  
Prior cost-effectiveness analyses found LAF to be more expensive than conventional 
ventilation systems. An Italian study 55 found that building costs increased 24% and annual 
operating costs increased 36%. 55 In Australia, Merollini and colleagues evaluated the costs of 
performing THA and found that  doing the procedures in ORs with LAF would add 4·59 
million Australian dollars per 30000 THA performed. 56 In Germany, Kramer and colleagues 
calculated additional costs of 3·24 Euros/procedure, if a 1000 procedures were done in ORs 
with LAF per year for 15 years.57 Graves and colleagues evaluated strategies to reduce the 
risk of deep SSI following THA and concluded that the combination of administering 
systemic antibiotics, using antibiotic-impregnated cement and performing THA in ORs with 
conventional ventilation led to the largest annual cost savings and the greatest gains in quality 
adjusted life years. When including LAF instead of conventional ventilation higher costs and 
worse health outcomes were found.58 In addition, validation of LAF ventilation systems is 
more expensive compared with conventional ventilation systems, without having any method 
and target limits based on scientific evidence of the relation between contamination of the air 
and risk of SSI.59 The threshold limit of ultra-clean air was arbitrarily defined by Lidwell and 
colleagues as <10 cfu/m³ and used as standard ever since.15,60 
The prior studies assessing whether LAF ventilation decreases the risk of SSI had numerous 
weaknesses and the evidence provided by those studies is of very low quality. The last 
randomized trials addressing this question were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s.15,17 Thus, 
we need further research, particularly well-designed clinical trials of endoprosthetic surgery, 
to determine whether OR ventilation reduces SSI rates. However, believe that such trials will 
most likely not be conducted. RCTs may not be reasonable as they would require very high 
sample size to have enough power to detect a significant difference and would be very 
expensive. For example, if the deep SSI rate in the control group was about 0·5% after THA 
and TKA (appendix, page 25), approximately 10000 patients would be needed in each group 
to detect a 50% reduction to an SSI rate of 0·25% (1-alpha: 95%, 1-beta: 80%). Even more 
patients would be needed to detect a difference of 40% or 30%. Cluster randomized trials 
could be problematic as it would be almost impossible to control for confounding factors in 
between the sites, such as different surgeons operating in the same OR. Therefore, nationwide 
databases may provide the best affordable information. However, to avoid the weakness of 
prior studies and meta-analyses thereof, national surveillance systems and registries would 
need to provide consistent and internationally standardized information about risk factors and 
confounders such as the OR ventilation system. Furthermore, surveillance of healthcare-
associated infections should be based upon internationally standardized definitions.  
 
Very low quality of evidence suggests that compared with conventional ventilation, LAF 
ventilation does not reduce the risk of deep SSI after THA and TKA. Even more limited 
evidence suggests that LAF does not reduce the overall SSI rate when compared with

ventilation systems appear to provide air that is clean enough for procedures involving 
orthopaedic implants. Given the available evidence demonstrated by this systematic review 
and the prior cost-effectiveness analyses, which found LAF systems to be more expensive 
than conventional ventilation systems, the surgical team, infection prevention and control 
professionals, hospital administrators, and policy makers should not choose to install and use 
LAF equipped ORs as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of SSI.

Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
Surgical site infections (SSI) range between the leading and the second most frequently reported 
health care-associated infections worldwide. The role of the laminar airflow (LAF) ventilation system 
in preventing SSI has been discussed for many decades, especially for orthopedic implant surgery. 
Apart from a randomized trail conducted in the 1970s, which did not control for the administration of 
prophylactic antibiotics, demonstrating a reduction of deep SSI rates in total hip (THA) and total knee 
arthroplasties (TKA) associated with the use of LAF in the operating room (OR) in comparison with 
procedures performed in conventionally ventilated ORs, these findings could not be reproduced in 
large studies published thereafter. We searched Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central and WHO 
Global Health from Jan 1, 1990 to Jan 31, 2014 using a combination of search terms of “ventilation”, 
“surgical wound infection”, and “operating rooms”. The search was updated for Medline for the time 
period between Feb 1, 2014 and May 27, 2016.  
 
Added value of this study 
Our study makes an important contribution to understanding the effects of LAF ventilation on clinical 
outcomes and shows there is consistent evidence reporting that LAF does not reduce the risk of SSI. 
We show that after THA, TKA, and abdominal surgery there is no difference in SSI rate whether the 
operations are performed in ORs equipped with LAF or with conventional ventilation systems.  
 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Given the available evidence demonstrated by this systematic review and prior cost-effectiveness 
analyses, which found LAF systems to be more expensive than conventional ventilation systems, LAF 
equipped ORs should not be used as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of SSI. As randomized 
trials are not likely to be conducted, national surveillance systems and registries would need to provide 
internationally standardized information on risk factors and confounders, and should use 
internationally standardized SSI definitions in order to increase our confidence in the results of further 
cohort studies.
