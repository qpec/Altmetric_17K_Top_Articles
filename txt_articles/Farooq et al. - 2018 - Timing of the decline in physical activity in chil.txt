background and aim There is a widely held and 
influential view that physical activity begins to decline 
at adolescence. This study aimed to identify the timing 
of changes in physical activity during childhood and 
adolescence.
Methods Longitudinal cohort study (Gateshead 
Millennium Study) with 8 years of follow-up, from 
North-East England. Cohort members comprise a 
socioeconomically representative sample studied at ages 
7, 9, 12 and 15 years; 545 individuals provided physical 
activity data at two or more time points. Habitual total 
volume of physical activity and moderate-to-vigorous 
intensity physical activity (MVPA) were quantified 
objectively using the Actigraph accelerometer over 
5–7 days at the four time points. Linear mixed models 
identified the timing of changes in physical activity across 
the 8-year period, and trajectory analysis was used to 
identify subgroups with distinct patterns of age-related 
changes.
results Four trajectories of change in total volume of 
physical activity were identified representing 100% of all 
participants: all trajectories declined from age 7 years. 
There was no evidence that physical activity decline 
began at adolescence, or that adolescent declines in 
physical activity were substantially greater than the 
declines during childhood, or greater in girls than boys. 
One group (19% of boys) had relatively high MVPA 
which remained stable between ages 7 and15 years.
Conclusions Future policy and research efforts to 
promote physical activity should begin well before 
adolescence, and should include both boys and girls.
InTrOduCTIOn
Systematic reviews have established that daily 
physical activity, particularly moderate-to-vig-
orous intensity physical activity (MVPA), is 
important for both the current and future 
health of children and adolescents.1 2 For many 
years the prevailing view among researchers, 
policy makers, and health and education practi-
tioners, based largely on subjective measurement 
of physical activity, has been that levels of phys-
ical activity are adequate during childhood, but 
decline dramatically during adolescence, with 
the adolescent decline being much more marked 
in girls than boys.3–6 A more marked decline in 
girls may be related to their advanced pubertal 
maturation compared with boys, though the 
relative importance of biological and environ-
mental influences on child and adolescent phys-
ical activity remains unclear.7 Much research and 
policy effort has been directed at adolescent girls, 
considered to be the ‘high risk group’ for low 
physical activity,3–6 with the implicit or explicit 
assumption that children and boys are at low risk. 
Many national and international physical activity 
surveillance programmes focus on adolescents,8 
also based on implicit or explicit assumptions that 
adolescence is the stage of the life course when 
physical activity declines dramatically.
While levels of MVPA among adolescents are 
typically much lower than recommended8 there is 
actually very little evidence that MVPA declines 
with the onset of adolescence, or that adolescent 
declines in MVPA are more marked in girls than 
boys. Dumith et al9 published the most recent 
systematic review of changes in physical activity 
during adolescence, with 26 eligible longitu-
dinal studies. Of these eligible studies only 2/26 
included objective measures of the intensity of 
physical activity (accelerometry), most (16/26) 
were from the USA, and the representativeness 
of the samples in the eligible studies was usually 
unclear.9 Moreover, since most studies completed 
data collection before 2000, they probably lack 
generalisability to contemporary populations 
given recent and dramatic societal changes: 
declines in active commuting,10 in the technology 
being used by children10 (eg, the ubiquitous nature 
of new screen-based media),11 and in overweight 
and obesity (which appear to reduce physical 
activity).12 The International Children’s Acceler-
ometry Database, though cross-sectional, suggests 
that objectively measured physical activity may 
be in decline in both sexes from around the 
age of school entry.13 We are aware of only one 
single longitudinal study which measured phys-
ical activity across childhood and adolescence: in 
children born in Iowa in the early 1990s physical 
activity declined, in both sexes, from age 5 years 
in most study participants.14 In summary, despite 
the well-established and influential concept that 
declines in physical activity begin at adolescence, 
an emerging body of evidence suggests that 
declines may occur earlier, but there is currently 
very little high-quality longitudinal evidence on 
the timing of changes in physical activity across 
childhood and adolescence in contemporary 
cohorts. The primary aim of the present study was

take place.
MeThOds
Participants, recruitment, consent and study design
Participants were from the Gateshead Millennium Cohort 
Study (GMS). Details of this cohort study have been published 
previously,15 but, in brief, the sample was socioeconomically 
representative of the north-east of England.15 This was a longi-
tudinal study and the intention was to repeat measures in as 
many of the original cohort members as possible at subsequent 
time points. Habitual physical activity measurements in the 
cohort began when participants were 7 years of age (October 
2006 to December 2007), and were repeated at 9 years of age 
(October 2008 to September 2009), 12 years of age (October 
2011 to December 2012) and 15 years of age (September 
2014 to September 2015). The study was approved by the 
Gateshead and South T
yneside Local National Health Service 
Research Ethics Committee for data collection at age 7 years, 
and by the Newcastle University Faculty of Medical Sciences 
Ethics Committee for subsequent measures. Informed written 
consent was obtained from the parent/main guardian of each 
child, and children and adolescents assented to participation.
Objective measurement of total volume of physical activity 
and MVPA
Habitual total ‘volume’ of physical activity (ie, light inten-
sity physical activity combined with MVPA) and MVPA were 
measured using Actigraph GT1M (Actigraph, Pensacola, FL, 
USA) accelerometers at all four time points. The Actigraph is a 
small, unobtrusive and lightweight monitor with high validity 
(relative to reference measures of physical activity, direct obser-
vation and energy expenditure), high reliability and low reac-
tivity in children,16 and has been used successfully in many 
paediatric physical activity studies internationally.13
The methodology for measurement of physical activity in the 
GMS cohort is described in detail elsewhere.17–21 In brief, partici-
pants were asked to wear the accelerometer during waking hours 
for 7 days, removing only for bed and water-based activities such 
as showering, bathing and swimming. Families were also given a 
log sheet to note when the monitor had been worn and removed 
each day. The accelerometers were set to record data in 15 
s 
sampling intervals (epochs) throughout the period the acceler-
ometer was worn. Data were reduced manually using accelerom-
etry output and log sheets, as described previously,17–21 to delete 
periods of non-wear time (corresponding to times noted by the 
parent, child or adolescent, as unworn). Total volume of physical 
activity was measured using the accelerometer output or counts 
per minute (cpm). Measuring the intensity of physical activity, 
specifically MVPA, requires that an accelerometer output thresh-
old—‘cut-off point’—is applied. T
wo evidence-based but distinct 
‘cut-off points’ have been used widely in the literature, but 
in the present study the cut-point of 574 counts per 15 s was 
used22 and it has acceptable classification accuracy.23 Since the 
Actigraph cut-off points used in this study were derived from 
studies using Actigraph model 7164 and the more recent Acti-
graph GT1M model has a consistent bias of 9% relative to model 
7164,24 a +9% correction was applied to the raw accelerom-
etry data before applying cut-off points. In UK children there 
are small seasonal variations in objectively measured habitual 
physical activity19 20 25 and so accelerometry measurements at 
ages 7, 9 and 12 years were made at the same time of the year 
as described previously17–21; at age 15 years close matching for 
season was not possible in all cases, hence accelerometry data 
were adjusted for season (summer or winter) during analysis.
Anthropometric and descriptive characteristics of study 
participants
Height was measured to 0.1 
cm with a Leicester portable height 
measure (Chasmors, London, UK) and weight measured to 
0.1 
kg in light indoor clothing and % body fat estimated with 
a Tanita TBF300MA (Chasmors, London UK).17–21 Body mass 
index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated, and z-scores estimated to 
UK 1990 population reference data.26 Socioeconomic status was 
assessed using Townsend scores at birth,27 an area-based measure 
derived from the UK census.
statistical analysis
The sample size for the present study was fixed by the size of the 
recruited cohort at age 7 years, and the extent of sample attrition 
over the 8-year period. However, the sample size was similar to 
or larger than most previous studies with two measures of phys-
ical activity.9 14 Further, the accuracy of both the reported levels 
of physical activity and sedentary behaviour and the changes in 
levels over the 2-year period is increased by the use of accel-
erometry and the longitudinal design and analyses used by the 
study. Linear mixed models were used with SPSS V
.21.0 statis-
tical software to describe age-related changes in physical activity. 
Gender, age groups and their interaction were fixed factors and 
participant ID was the clustering random variable using unstruc-
tured covariance structure for age group as repeated measure-
ment. For the MVPA data at age 15 years, season (winter or 
summer) was added as a factor to adjust for seasonal variation 
in physical activity. Post hoc pairwise differences were reported 
as absolute change with 95% CIs after Bonferroni adjustment.
Group-based modelling of longitudinal data to identify 
distinct trajectories of age-related changes in physical activity 
was performed using the Traj module plug-in in STATA V
.11.0. 
This method, initially developed by Nagin et al,28 has recently 
been applied to longitudinal physical activity data.14 Group-
based modelling to identify trajectories can identify patterns 
of change, incorporating multiple different time trends and 
multiple different levels at baseline.28 Given potential differences 
in trajectories of physical activity change between the sexes, 
they were modelled separately for boys and girls. The trajec-
tories were modelled using either quadratic or linear trends. 
In a step-by-step manner, we increased the number of distinct 
trajectories that can be extracted from the data, first by eval-
uating the posterior probabilities for each model for tenability 
and by comparing fit statistics as defined by the Bayesian Infor-
mation Criterion (BIC) to be lowest. The process of specifying 
the number of distinct trajectories and selection of linear versus 
quadratic trend for each trajectory continued until there was no 
substantial improvement in model fit. Non-significant quadratic 
terms were replaced with linear terms irrespective of significance 
to ensure parsimony of the model.29 Using a maximum prob-
ability assignment rule, each participant was classified under a 
trajectory for which posterior membership probability was the 
highest. Trajectories and the 95% CIs surrounding each trajec-
tory were plotted.

than those with complete data, but similar physical activity.
summary data on physical activity at each of the four 
measurements
Summary data on total volume of physical activity (acceler-
ometer cpm, a measure of light intensity physical activity and 
MVPA combined) and MVPA, at each time point between ages 
7 and 15 years, are shown in table 1. Mean accelerometry moni-
toring period ranged from 5.3 to 6.4 days and 667 to 725 
min 
per day across the four time points.
Changes in physical activity analysed longitudinally using 
trajectory analysis
The longitudinal trajectory analyses for changes in total volume 
of physical activity are shown in figure 1 for boys and girls: in 
the boys three distinct trajectories were identified, but in all three 
subgroups, representing 100% of the sample, the total volume 
of physical activity declined across the 8-year period from age 7 
years; in the girls a single trajectory of declining total physical 
activity across the 8-year period from age 7 years characterised 
all study participants. None of the trajectories of total volume 
of physical activity showed initial high levels followed by sharp 
adolescent declines.
The longitudinal trajectories of change in MVPA for boys and 
girls are shown in figure 2. In boys, four distinct subgroups were 
identified: low and relatively stable/slowly declining MVPA from 
age 7 years across the 8 years (3% of the sample); initially high 
at age 7 years, but rapidly declining from age 7 years (17% 
of 
the sample); gradually declining from age 7 years (61% 
of the 
sample); relatively high and stable or increasing from age 7 years 
(19% of the sample).
The longitudinal trajectories of change in MVPA of girls 
are also shown in figure 2. Three distinct trajectories were 
identified: low and relatively stable/ with modest declines 
(19%); gradually declining from age 7 years (62%); high 
initial MVPA with steeper declines from age 7 years (19%). 
None of the trajectories of MVPA in either boys or girls were 
characterised by high and stable childhood values followed by 
sharp adolescent declines.

dIsCussIOn
Main study findings and implications
The present study suggests that total volume of physical activity 
is already declining by age 7 years in the UK. The present study 
found that 100% of boys and girls fitted into longitudinal trajec-
tories which were inconsistent with the orthodox view that phys-
ical activity begins to decline at adolescence, declines much more 
rapidly at adolescence and/or declines much more rapidly in 
adolescent girls than boys. The present study therefore suggests 
that much of the current UK and international policy and prac-
tice in this area, based on the orthodox view, is not evidence-
based. The main implication of our findings for future research 
and public health policy in physical activity and health is the 
need for a much greater emphasis on childhood rather than 
adolescence, and on both boys and girls.
Trajectories of change in MVPA were more complex than 
trajectories of change in total volume of physical activity, but 
it is of note that in around 19% of boys MVPA was relatively 
high and fairly stable across the 8-year period. These distinct 
trajectories of physical activity are new, and their determinants 
are unclear, but understanding why a minority of participants 
maintained a relatively high and stable level of MVPA across 
childhood and adolescence would help inform future policy and 
clinical practice.
Consistency of evidence from the present study with other 
studies
The International Children’s Accelerometry Database (ICAD), 
a global data-pooling initiative, has recently demonstrated that 
mean values for total volume of physical activity and MVPA both 
appear to decline steadily after the age of 5 years.13 While this 
ICAD study was cross-sectional, and most samples not contem-
porary, ICAD data also provide no support for the view that 
physical activity decline either begins at adolescence, or increases 
markedly at adolescence. In the UK, recent nationally represen-
tative but cross-sectional accelerometry measures also suggest 
that total volume of physical activity begins to decline around 
the age of school entry.30
Since the recent systematic review on changes in physical 
activity during adolescence by Dumith et al,9 four English 
cohort studies have reported on objectively measured longitu-
dinal changes in MVPA during adolescence, though these studies 
do not span both childhood and adolescence. Harding et al31 (n 
363; age 12–15 years) and Mitchell et al32 (n 5436; 12–16 years) 
found negligible declines in objectively measured MVPA during 
adolescence. Corder et al6 (n 480; 10–14 years) and Collings et 
al33 (n 144; 15–17 years) found small declines in MVPA which 
were slightly greater in boys than girls. In summary, recent English 
longitudinal studies which used objective measures of physical 
activity are consistent with the present study in suggesting that 
physical activity does not decline especially markedly at adoles-
cence, and does not decline more markedly in girls than boys 
during adolescence.
Data from the Iowa Bone Development Study were consis-
tent with the present study in suggesting that total volume 
of physical activity declined either steadily or dramatically 
from age 5 years in >70% of participants.14 Other evidence 
is also consistent with the findings of the present study in 
suggesting that lifestyles of English children become particu-
larly ‘obesogenic’ during mid-childhood. In the Avon Longi-
tudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort in England for 
example the incidence (appearance of new cases) of obesity 
across childhood and adolescence peaked around age 7 years,34 
and among non-obese individuals the rate of excessive weight 
gain also peaked at the same time.35 The recent systematic 
review by Tanaka et al also found that accelerometer-measured 
daily sedentary time increased from around the age of school 
entry, and as sedentary time increased with age physical activity 
was displaced.36
study strengths and weaknesses
The main strengths of the present study were the longitudinal 
design, the high quality objective measures of physical activity, 
the socioeconomically representative sample and the contempo-
rary nature of the cohort. One weakness may be generalisability 
to populations with substantially different physical, social and/
or policy environments. Further research will therefore be neces-
sary to determine whether or not the findings of the present 
study are generalisable to other populations. The present study 
aimed to describe when changes in physical activity occurred. 
The issue of why any changes take place (eg, the relative impor-
tance of biological versus environmental factors)7 is important, 
but is a distinct question which was beyond the scope of the 
present study. Changes in physical activity arise as a result of 
a complex and currently poorly understood7 combination of 
biological and environmental influences. An improved under-
standing of why changes in physical activity take place and why 
individuals follow one trajectory rather than another, would 
also be important to future public health applications, but 
would require measures which were not available in the present 
study (eg, ideally direct measures of biological variables such 
as pubertal maturation).7 Trajectory analysis can also act as a

tool to predict future MVPA based on current MVPA status, and 
future research could also identify how accurate such predic-
tions might be. The trajectory analyses identified relatively large 
subgroups, with one exception: the 3% of boys with low and 
relatively stable/slowly declining MVPA over the 8 years. Exclu-
sion of this subgroup would have reduced model fit as judged 
by the BIC and CIs around the groups, and so it was retained. 
Future studies would be useful to confirm whether or not this 
small group exists in other populations. Finally, the periods 
between the four measurement periods in the present study 
were chosen so as to be adequate to detect longitudinal changes 
in physical activity between measurements (ie, to permit real 
changes to be distinguishable from measurement imprecision). 
However, timing of measurements was determined largely by 
the availability of grant funding, and more frequent measure-
ments might have provided more nuanced evidence on the 
timing of changes.
COnClusIOns
The present study suggests that physical activity is in decline 
in most individuals of both sexes by age 6–7 years in the UK. 
The study questions the concept of the adolescent girl as a 
priority for research and policy effort in physical activity. Future 
research and public health policy should focus on (A) preventing 
the decline in physical activity which begins in childhood, not 
adolescence and (B) providing an improved understanding of 
the determinants of the different physical activity trajectories, 
including an understanding of the relative importance of biolog-
ical and environmental influences.7
What are the findings?
 
► Physical activity declines markedly during childhood, and the 
age-related decline does not begin at adolescence
 
► The physical activity decline from childhood occurs in both 
boys and girls
 
► Physical activity decline is not uniform—a small but 
significant minority of boys maintained relatively high and 
stable levels of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical 
activity across childhood and adolescence
how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
 
► Future efforts to arrest age-related decline in physical activity 
should begin well before adolescence
 
► We should abandon the concept of ‘high risk groups’ (eg, 
adolescent girls) for low physical activity—most of the 
paediatric population is at high risk
