CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among a predominantly male population with major
depressive disorder unresponsive to antidepressant treatment, augmentation with
aripiprazole resulted in a statistically significant but only modestly increased likelihood of
remission during 12 weeks of treatment compared with switching to bupropion monotherapy.
Given the small effect size and adverse effects associated with aripiprazole, further analysis
including cost-effectiveness is needed to understand the net utility of this approach.

 M
ajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic,
debilitating disorder1 that affected an estimated
16.1 million adults in the United States in 2015.2
Given that less than one-third of patients achieve re-
mission with their first course of antidepressant pharmaco-
therapy,3,4 an estimated 10.8 million US residents may
benefit from an alternative treatment each year. For these
patients, most treatment guidelines recommend either
switching to another antidepressant or adjunctive use of an-
otherantidepressantornonantidepressantagent.5-7Amongthe
most commonly used of these treatment strategies are switch-
ing to bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake in-
hibitor, and adjunctive use of either bupropion or aripip-
razole, a second-generation antipsychotic that is a partial
dopamine agonist.8
The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depres-
sion (STAR*D) trial showed that bupropion was at least as ef-
fectiveasotherswitching9andaugmentingagents.10However,
STAR*Dwasnotpoweredtocomparebupropionswitchingand
augmentation strategies,11 and atypical antipsychotics, fre-
quently used as adjunctive agents for treatment-resistant MDD
even prior to US Food and Drug Administration approval,12
were not included. Several studies have shown efficacy of
aripiprazole as an antidepressant augmentation strategy13 and
a recent study suggested aripiprazole augmentation is more
beneficial than antidepressant switching and has compa-
rable tolerability.14 However, adequately powered and well-
controlled clinical trials have yet to compare the effective-
nessofthese2treatmentsorcomparethemwithaugmentation
with a second antidepressant.
The primary objective of this randomized clinical trial
was to compare the effectiveness and adverse effect profiles
of 3 commonly used alternative MDD treatment strategies:
switch to the antidepressant bupropion sustained release;
augment current treatment with bupropion sustained
release; or augment current treatment with the antipsychotic
aripiprazole.15
Methods
The Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Research and Develop-
ment and VA Central Institutional Review Board approved
the study, the National Institutes of Health provided a certifi-
cate of confidentiality, the VA Central Institutional Review
Board conducted annual continuing review, and a data and
safety monitoring committee reviewed the study biannually.
All patients provided written informed consent and privacy
authorization. The full study protocol can be found in
Supplement 1.
Study Design
VA Augmentation and Switching Treatments for Improving
Depression Outcomes (VAST-D) was a multisite randomized,
single-blind, parallel-assignment trial including US Veterans
Health Administration (VHA) patients whose condition was
unresponsive to at least 1 course of antidepressant treatment
meeting minimal standards for dose and duration.
Patient Selection
Participants were VHA patients, 18 years or older, with an
MDD diagnosis, who were referred by their VA clinicians.
Diagnostic eligibility was further established by research staff
using criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR),
supplemented with the 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-9; range, 0-27; 0 indicates better health, 27 indicates
worse health).16 Study clinicians determined final diagnoses.
Race and ethnicity were determined by self-report using
open-ended questions and were recorded to document the
level of inclusion of minority populations.
Patients with a suboptimal response to a treatment
course with a selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor, seroto-
nin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or mirtazapine
that met or exceeded minimal standards for dose and dura-
tion of treatment were eligible (Supplement 2).15 Subopti-
mal response was defined as a score of 16 or more (indicat-
ing severe depression) on the 16-Item Quick Inventory of
Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician Rated (QIDS-C16)
questionnaire17 after at least 6 weeks of treatment or a
score of 11 or more (indicating moderately severe depres-
sion) after at least 8 weeks of treatment with the 3 most
recent weeks at a stable “optimal” dose (Supplement 2).
Patients were excluded if they were receiving current
treatment with bupropion or any antipsychotic; had a life-
time history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffec-
tive disorder, or other psychosis; had current dementia, an
eating disorder, or a seizure disorder; suicidal ideation requir-
ing inpatient treatment; had an unstable medical condition;
had need of immediate psychiatric hospitalization; had sub-
stance dependence requiring detoxification in the past 30
days; were pregnant, lactating, or planning to become preg-
nant; or were unable or unwilling to provide informed con-
sent or declined to participate prior to randomization.
Randomization
Patients at 35 VA medical centers were randomized to 1 of 3
treatments: switch to another antidepressant, bupropion sus-
tained release (switch group); augment current treatment
Key Points
Question Is there a difference among pharmacotherapeutic
approaches for treating patients with depression unresponsive to
an antidepressant course?
Findings In a 12-week follow-up of a randomized clinical trial of
1522 patients with major depressive disorder (85% men)
unresponsive to previous antidepressant treatment, 29%
achieved remission after augmenting their antidepressant
with the antipsychotic aripiprazole vs 22% who switched to the
antidepressant bupropion. Other remission comparisons were
not significant.
Meaning Augmentation with aripiprazole resulted in a statistically
significant, but only modestly increased, likelihood of remission
during 12 weeks of treatment compared with switching to
bupropion alone.

 with bupropion sustained release (augment-bupropion
group); or augment current treatment with an antipsychotic,
aripiprazole (augment-aripiprazole group) (Figure 1). They
were randomized using a stratified randomization scheme
balanced (1:1:1) within each medical center using a random
permuted-block scheme with variable block sizes (3 or 6) and
random number generation in SAS Proc Plan (SAS Institute)
prepared by VA Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating
Center. After patient eligibility was confirmed, randomiza-
tion was completed by site personnel using a web-based
application. Outcomes were assessed by independent evalua-
tors blind to treatment assignment.
Interventions
Treatments included titration (cross-titration for the switch
group) from standard starting doses of 150 mg of bupropion
sustained release to 300 mg or 400 mg daily; or from 2 mg of
aripiprazole with titration to 5, 10, or 15 mg daily, until
depressive symptoms remitted or adverse effects were intol-
erable. Dose adjustments were guided by “measurement-
based care”18 using a patient-rated symptom measure
(PHQ-9)16 and a global adverse effects measure (Frequency,
Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating [FIBSER]; range
0-18, 0 indicates no adverse effects, 18 indicates severe
adverse effects; scores >8 suggest doses should not be
increased due to adverse effects.)19 at each visit. Acute treat-
ment visits occurred at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
and 12. The acute treatment phase was up to 12 weeks and up
to 36 weeks for longer-term follow-up.
Patients who tolerated acute treatment and achieved ad-
equate benefit were eligible to enter a 24-week continuation
phase to evaluate relapse and other outcomes. Adequate ben-
efit was defined as either QIDS-C16 score of 8 or less at 12 weeks
or QIDS-C16 score of 9 or 10 with clinician judgment of ad-
equatebenefit.Thisarticleaddressesrelapseamongthosewho
achieved remission during the acute treatment phase with fol-
low-up for relapse of symptoms for up to 36 weeks. Assigned
treatment was sustained after 12 weeks and follow-up visits
occurred every 4 weeks.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was remission (close to asymptomatic
status), defined as a QIDS-C16 score (range, 0-27 with higher
scores indicating more severe symptoms) of 5 or less at 2 con-
secutive scheduled follow-up visits during the acute treat-
ment phase. The QIDS-C16 questionnaire was administered
every visit. Secondary outcomes included 2 measures of
response: reduction in QIDS-C16 score from baseline by 50%
or more20 and a Clinical Global Impression (CGI)21 Improve-
ment scale rating (range, 0-7; 0 indicates not assessed, 1 indi-
cates very much improved since the initiation of treatment, 7
indicates very much worse since the initiation of treatment)
of 2 (much improved) or 1 (very much improved) at any
scheduled visit through week 12; and 1 measure of relapse:
QIDS-C16 score of 11 or more during the continuation phase
after achieving remission in the acute treatment phase.
Other secondary measures that were assessed but not re-
ported in this article include suicidal ideation and behaviors,
anxiety, global improvement, quality of life, health-related
costs and cost-effectiveness, and medication adherence and
satisfaction.
At each visit, treatment-emergent adverse effects were
queried with a checklist based on the Systematic Assess-
ment for Treatment of Emergent Events—Specific Inquiry
(SAFETEE-SI)22andvitalsignswereobtained.A7%weightgain
was considered clinically important.23 Every 12 weeks, labo-
ratory assessments and metabolic indicators were obtained for
safety monitoring. Serious adverse events, reported to the
sponsor as required, were tabulated for 30 days after with-
drawal from the study.
Statistical Methods
A clinically significant difference in remission of 10% was cho-
sen for estimating sample size and power based on results of
previous trials.9,10 A target sample size of 1518 patients (506
per treatment group) was chosen to give 90% power to detect
a 10% increase in remission for an augmentation group com-
pared with the switch group (hypothetically 35% vs 25% re-
mission, odds ratio [OR], 1.62) at a P value of less than .05, and
84% power to detect a 10% increase in remission for the other
co-primary hypothesis at a P value of less than .025. The sec-
ondary hypothesis comparing the augment-aripiprazole group
and augment-bupropion groups would then have 80% power
to detect a 9% absolute difference (30% vs 39%; OR, 1.49) in
remission at a P value of less than .05.
To compare the proportion of patients achieving remis-
sion in each augmentation group relative to the proportion
of patients achieving remission in the switch group, the
intention-to-treat analysis for these co-primary hypotheses
used logistic regression models stratified by participating
medical center. The 2 co-primary hypotheses were tested
using the Wald test statistic and the sequentially rejective
procedure of Hochberg24 with a familywise type I error
rate of .05 (2-sided) for the largest P value, and, if not sig-
nificant, a test at the .025 level (2-sided) for the smallest
P value. Using a gatekeeping approach, the treatment effect
for the augment-aripiprazole group vs augment-bupropion
group was evaluated at .05 as the second family of compari-
sons only if at least 1 of the co-primary hypotheses tests
were statistically significant. To correct for overestimation
of the risk ratio by the odds ratio, log-binomial regression
was used for analysis of remission and the analysis of the
secondary response outcomes; relative risk (RR) ratios with
95% CIs are reported (SAS PROC GENMOD [SAS Institute]).
A supportive mixed-model analysis including participat-
ing medical centers as random effects was also conducted
(SAS PROC GLIMMIX [SAS Institute]).
Time-to-event analysis of relapse among patients
achieving remission in the acute treatment phase was based
on time from remission to relapse within the 36-week
study period. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calcu-
late cumulative time-to-event curves for remission, re-
sponse, and relapse. Treatment differences were tested
using the Cox proportional-hazards regression models
stratified by site. For relapse, treatment comparisons yield-
ing a P value of less than .025 were considered significant,

 except for the augment-aripiprazole group vs augment-
bupropion group for which a P value of less than .05 was
considered significant.
Results for the primary outcome, remission in the acute
phase, and secondary outcomes including response and
relapse among those who achieved remission in the acute
treatment phase as well as adverse events occurring through-
out follow-up are presented in this article. Missing data due
to missed assessments were treated as missing and were not
imputed in the primary analysis. Overall, 178 scheduled
visits (1.7%) in the acute treatment phase were missed
(eTable 1 in Supplement 2). For data missing due to with-
drawal before week 12, the status of the patient at the last
completed assessment was retained. There was no imputa-
tion of QIDS-C16 scores for missing assessments.
Multiple imputation methods (SAS Procedures MI and
MIANALYZE [both from SAS Institute]) were used in sensi-
tivity analyses to impute values (0 or 1) for protocol remis-
sion and protocol response for patients who withdrew prior
to week 12. Patients who withdrew due to lack of treatment
effect were considered to be unresponsive to treatment.
Baseline QIDS-C16 score, age, sex, days of participation, and
treatment group were used to impute missing values for
19.4% of the patients.
The proportions of patients who developed adverse
effects were compared across treatment groups using χ2
tests for the difference in proportions at the .05 significance
level, and subgroupings of serious adverse events (SAEs)
or nonserious adverse events at the .01 significance level.
Pairwise comparisons were performed for the composite
akathisia symptom and extrapyramidal adverse effects
count, and a P value of less than .025 was considered sig-
nificant, except for the augment-aripiprazole group vs
augment-bupropion group for which a P value of less than
.05 was considered significant.
For other secondary (supportive) analyses, a P value of less
than .025 was considered significant, except for the augment-
aripiprazole group vs augment-bupropion group for which a
P value of less than .05 was considered significant.
SAS software (SAS Institute), version 9.3, was used to com-
plete these analyses.
One interim analysis using conditional power calcula-
tions was conducted for futility (conditional power lower
boundary of 25%) or sample size reestimation (25% < condi-
tional power < 80%) after approximately 50% enrollment. No
sample size increase was indicated and the study was contin-
ued.
Results
Study Population
Of the 7234 VHA patients screened, 1861 patients (25.7%)
consented to participate and, of these, 1522 (81.8%) were
randomly assigned to the switch group (n = 511), augment-
bupropion group (n = 506), and augment-aripiprazole group
(n = 505) (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics, described
previously,25 were similar across treatment groups (Table 1).
Treatment and Retention
Index antidepressants are presented in Table 1; the bupro-
pion or aripiprazole dose prescribed at each visit is presented
in eTable 1 in Supplement 2. In the switch group, the modal
dose of bupropion reached a maximum of 200 mg twice daily
by 6 weeks and remained at that level through 12 weeks.
The augment-bupropion group also reached the maximum
modal dose by 6 weeks. In the augment-aripiprazole group,
the modal dose was 5 mg daily from weeks 2 through 10
and reached 10 mg daily at week 12. Doses of study medica-
tions were initiated at randomization per protocol for all but
3 patients.
Retention of patients through the 12-week acute treat-
ment phase was greatest for the augment-aripiprazole
group (80.4%), lower for the augment-bupropion group
(74.7%) and lowest for the switch group (69.1%) (Figure 1).
Withdrawal for lack of response was lowest for the augment-
aripiprazole group (2.6%), followed by the augment-
bupropion group (5.5%) and the switch group (9.6%). With-
drawal for medication adverse effects was also lower for the
augment-aripiprazole group (5.3%) than either the augment-
bupropion group (7.3%) or switch group (10.0%) (Figure 1).
The major reason for withdrawal at week 12 was lack of
response per protocol (Figure 1). Those who achieved remis-
sion (n = 396) were followed up for relapse for up to 36 weeks
after randomization.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of remission occurring through week
12 was significantly, albeit modestly, higher for the augment-
aripiprazole group (28.9%) compared with the switch group
(22.3%; RR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.05-1.60]; P = .02) but not com-
pared with the augment-bupropion group (26.9%; RR, 1.08
[95% CI, 0.88-1.31]; P = .47) (Table 2 and Table 3). Remission
with the augment-bupropion group was not significantly dif-
ferent than the switch group (RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.97-1.50];
P = .09). Cox regression analysis of time to remission showed
no significant differences in cumulative remission for the
augment-aripiprazole group vs the switch group (hazard ratio
[HR], 1.28 [95% CI, 1.00-1.64]; P = .05), the augment-
bupropion group vs the switch group (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.89-
1.48]; P = .27), or the augment-aripiprazole group vs the
augment-bupropion group (HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.84-1.35];
P = .61) (Figure 2A). The supportive mixed-model analysis
including participating medical centers as random effects
showed essentially the same results as the stratified primary
analysis (Supplement 2).
Response, a secondary outcome based on 50% reduction
in QIDS-C16 score, was significantly higher for the augment-
aripiprazole group (74.3%) than for both the switch group
(62.4%; RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.09-1.29]; P < .001) and the
augment-bupropion group (65.6%; RR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.04-
1.23]; P = .003), with no significant difference between the
augment-bupropion group and the switch group (RR, 1.05
[95% CI, 0.96-1.15]; P = .29) (Table 2 and Table 3). Response
measured by CGI improvement similarly favored the
augment-aripiprazole group (79%) compared with both the
switch group (70%; RR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.06-1.22]; P < .001) and

 the augment-bupropion group (74%; RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.00-
1.14]; P = .07) (Table 2 and Table 3).
In the Cox regression analysis of response based on the
QIDS-C16 score, cumulative response for the augment-
aripiprazole group was greater than both the switch group
(HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.13-1.54]; P < .001) and augment-
bupropion group (HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.05-1.43]; P = .007)
(Figure 2B). Cumulative response did not differ significantly
between the augment-bupropion group and switch group
(HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.89-1.23]; P = .56).
The results of the multiple-imputation sensitivity analy-
sis for protocol remission at week 12 showed comparison of
the augment-aripiprazole group vs the switch group to be
statistically significant (RR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.07-1.66]; P = .01),
but not the augment-bupropion group vs the switch group
(RR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.93-1.46]; P = .19). For response as defined
by the protocol, there was a statistically significant effect for
the augment-aripiprazole group vs the switch group (RR, 1.26
[95% CI, 1.13-1.39]; P < .001) but not for the augment-
bupropion group vs the switch group (RR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.99-
1.23]; P = .08).
Among the 396 patients achieving remission in the acute
treatment phase, there were no significant differences in the
secondary outcome of cumulative relapse: augment-
bupropion group vs switch group (HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.78-
2.39]; P = .70); augment-aripiprazole group vs switch group
(HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.65-1.94]; P = .68); or augment-bupropion
group vs augment-aripiprazole group (HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.58-
1.59]; P = .87) (Figure 3).
Adverse Events
Among 165 patients (10.8%), a total of 207 SAEs occurred
(Table 4). Eight deaths occurred among study patients dur-
ing the safety reporting period: 3 during follow-up; and 5 in
the 30 days after withdrawal or completion of follow-up,
with 1 completed suicide. Causes of death included com-
pleted suicide, sudden unexpected death, chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease, bilateral pulmonary embolisms,
arteriosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction, lung cancer,
and rhabdomyolysis. The investigators and the data and
safety monitoring committee agreed that the deaths were
not related to study medication.
There were 4356 nonserious adverse events recorded
(eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Specific nonserious adverse
events occurred in a greater proportion of patients in the
switch group than in the other groups and included nausea,
irritability, and hypomania (Table 4). Nonserious adverse
events occurring in greater proportions of both the switch
and augment-bupropion groups than among patients in the
augment-aripiprazole group included anxiety, decreased
appetite, dry mouth, and increased blood pressure. Nonse-
rious adverse events occurring in a greater proportion of

 patients in the augment-aripiprazole group compared with
the other 2 groups included fatigue, increased appetite,
increased weight, akathisia, somnolence, and abnormal
values for several laboratory tests. At week 12, weight gain
of 7% or greater was more frequent for the augment-
aripiprazole group (38 of 399 patients [9.5%]) compared
with the switch group (8 of 347 patients [2.3%]) and the
augment-bupropion group (7 of 369 patients [1.9%]). For the
subset of patients continuing through week 36, the propor-
tion with weight gain 7% or greater was also greater for the
augment-aripiprazole group (53 of 210 patients [25.2%])
compared with the augment-bupropion group (10 of 193
patients [5.2%]) and the switch group (8 of 153 patients
[5.2%]) (Table 4).
Discussion
In this randomized clinical trial in a predominantly male
population with MDD who were unresponsive to antidepres-
sant treatment, augmentation with aripiprazole resulted in a
statistically significant but only modestly increased likeli-
hood of remission during 12 weeks of treatment compared
with switching to bupropion monotherapy. On 2 measures of
response, the secondary outcome, the augment-aripiprazole
group exceeded both the switch group and the augment-
bupropion group. The lowest discontinuation rates were also
observed for the augment-aripiprazole group. There were
no significant differences in relapse rates between treat-
ment groups among acute treatment phase remitters dur-
ing the continuation phase. On adverse effects, the results
were mixed with treatment-emergent anxiety favoring the
augment-aripiprazole group and akathisia, somnolence, and
weight gain favoring the switch group and the augment-
bupropion group.
The most clinically meaningful adverse event occurr-
ing in at least 5% of patients in the switch and augment-
bupropion groups was increased anxiety (which also
included reports of nervousness). Anxiety is known to be a
negative prognostic factor in patients with MDD associated
with poor response, increased relapse and recurrence, and
suicide risk.26 On the other hand, the augment-aripiprazole
group reported more somnolence, extrapyramidal effects
(including akathisia), and weight gain than the 2 bupropion
groups. Although each of these adverse effects has been
associated with dropping out of treatment,27 dropout rates
in this study were smallest for the augment-aripiprazole
group, suggesting limited effect of these adverse effects on
treatment adherence. Although weight gain did not lead to
medication discontinuation, it is related to metabolic syn-
drome and could lead to serious health concerns in the
long-term. There is a need to further investigate the benefit-
risk ratio of long-term risks of weight gain and other adverse
effects compared with the benefit of modestly reducing
depression. A major asset of the VAST-D study is the com-
parative evaluation of the longer-term benefits and risks of
this second-generation antipsychotic, the first approved for
this indication.
Although use of the augment-aripiprazole strategy as an
alternative treatment may offer an increased likelihood of re-
mission, patients should be alerted to the risk of weight gain
in a process of shared decision making28 and baseline screen-
ing and follow-up monitoring of metabolic indicators should
be provided.29
Limitations
This study had several limitations. First, only 1 antidepres-
sant (bupropion sustained release) and 1 antipsychotic (arip-
iprazole) were evaluated, and the generalizability of the
results to other medications is unknown.
Second, only 1137 patients (74.7%) completed the
12-week acute treatment phase and differences in outcomes
between groups were small in magnitude. Multiple imputa-
tion was used to address missing data due to withdrawals,
and the results of imputing 12-week outcomes were consis-
tent with the direction and magnitude of effects reported in
the primary analysis of protocol defined remission and
response. A limitation of the imputation analysis was that
withdrawals may be associated with outcome or treatment
assignment so that missing data could not be assumed to be
missing at random.
Third, it is possible that discontinuation in the switch
group was increased by withdrawal symptoms from their
previous treatment. Fourth, the study was conducted with

HR, hazard ratio. Time to first relapse was determined by first occurrence of
QIDS-C16 score of 11 or more after remission in the acute treatment phase
through the week 36 visit. Follow-up time 0 indicates the day that remission
was determined. The proportions relapsing within each treatment group
were 26 of 114 patients (22.8%) for the switch group, 35 of 136 patients
(25.7%) for the augment-bupropion group, and 37 of 146 patients (25.3%)
for the augment-aripiprazole group. Follow-up time was censored in this
analysis if the patient withdrew from the study. HRs for stratified life-table
regressions for relapse: augment-bupropion group vs switch group,
1.36 (95% CI, 0.78-2.39); augment-aripiprazole group vs switch group,
1.12 (95% CI, 0.65-1.94); augment-aripiprazole group vs augment-bupropion
group, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.58-1.59). Median follow-up time to relapse
or censoring was 163 days (interquartile range [IQR], 70-201) for the switch
group, 163 days (IQR, 68.5-197) for the augment-bupropion group and 160.5
days (IQR, 59-203) for the augment-aripiprazole group. Maximum follow-up
time was 245 days.

 VA patients with many exclusion criteria. As a result, the gen-
eralizability of results from this older, predominantly male
population is also unknown. However, with a mean QIDS-C16
score of 16.6 to 16.9 across groups (SD, 3.2-3.3), this sample
was in the severe depression range (score, 16-20),17 similar to
the STAR*D study (mean score, 16.2 [SD, 4.1]) although the
duration of the current episode in the VAST*D study was
a mean of 87 months, which is considerably longer, and sug-
gests less potential for treatment responsiveness than the
mean of 28 months in the second step of the STAR*D study.30
Other important secondary outcomes, including cost-
effectiveness, quality of life, and suicidal ideation that may
clarify the balance between clinical benefits and adverse
effects still need to be addressed.

bP values are from the results of exact χ2 tests for differences in proportions
of patients with an adverse events or serious adverse events between
treatments.
c Percentage indicates the percentage of patients with the adverse event
divided by the No. of patients at risk in the treatment group.
dEight deaths occurred during follow-up or within 30 days after withdrawal and
were not attributed to the study (reviewed by data and safety monitoring
committee and the VA Central institutional review board). Causes of death
include completed suicide, sudden unexpected death, due to chronic

 Conclusions
Among a predominantly male population with major depres-
sive disorder unresponsive to antidepressant treatment, aug-
mentation with aripiprazole resulted in a statistically signifi-
cantbutonlymodestlyincreasedlikelihoodofremissionduring
12 weeks of treatment compared with switching to bupro-
pion monotherapy. Given the small effect size and adverse ef-
fects associated with aripiprazole, further analysis including
cost-effectiveness is needed to understand the net utility of
this approach.
