Background. Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective for preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infec-
tion, but risk compensation (RC) in men who have sex with men (MSM) raises concerns about increased sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) PrEP guidelines recommend biannual STI screening, 
which may reduce incidence by treating STIs that would otherwise remain undiagnosed. We investigated these two counteracting 
phenomena.
Methods. With a network-based mathematical model of HIV, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) 
transmission dynamics among MSM in the United States, we simulated PrEP uptake following the prescription indications and HIV/
STI screening recommendations in the CDC guidelines. Scenarios varied PrEP coverage (the proportion of MSM indicated for PrEP 
who received it), RC (a reduction in the per-act probability of condom use), and the STI screening interval.
Results. In our reference scenario (40% coverage, 40% RC), 42% of NG and 40% of CT infections would be averted over the 
next decade. A doubling of RC would still result in net STI prevention relative to no PrEP. STIs declined because PrEP-related STI 
screening resulted in a 17% and 16% absolute increase in the treatment of asymptomatic and rectal STIs, respectively. Screening and 
timely treatment at quarterly vs biannual intervals would reduce STI incidence an additional 50%.
Conclusions. Implementation of the CDC PrEP guidelines while scaling up PrEP coverage could result in a significant decline in 
STI incidence among MSM. Our study highlights the design of PrEP not only as antiretroviral medication but as combination HIV/
STI prevention incorporating STI screening.

Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can reduce the risk of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by more than 95% 
among men who have sex with men (MSM) when taken 
consistently [1]. Adherence to PrEP has been strong in open-
label studies, including a clinical cohort in California in which 
no incident HIV infections were observed among active PrEP 
users [2]. However, 50% of men on PrEP in that cohort were 
diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) within 
12 months of starting medication. High levels of STI incidence 
were also observed in the PrEP Demo Project, where the overall 
STI incidence rate was 90 per 100 person-years [3]. A recent 
metaanalysis compared the STI incidence among MSM in PrEP 
cohorts to MSM in non-PrEP cohorts, estimating that incidence 
among PrEP users was 33.3 per 100 person-years at risk (PYAR) 
higher for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and 31.4 per 100 PYAR 
higher for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) [4]. There are at least 
3 noncausal explanations for these excess rates: increased STI 
detection (if STIs were more frequently screened for in the PrEP 
cohorts), selection bias (if the PrEP cohorts recruited higher-
risk samples of MSM), and secular trends (STI incidence has 
increased over time, and the PrEP cohorts included more recent 
samples).
The primary causal mechanism by which PrEP use could 
lead to higher STI incidence would be behavioral risk compen-
sation (RC); MSM who initiate PrEP may reduce their use of 
other disease prevention strategies [5]. Estimates of whether 
RC occurs among MSM on PrEP, and by how much, have been 
mixed. The PrEP Demo Project saw no increase in condom-
less anal intercourse (AI) [3], consistent with the iPrEx trial 
[6], whereas 41% of PrEP users in the California clinic-based

 STI Incidence Following HIV PrEP Among MSM • CID 2017:65 (1 September) • 713
cohort had reduced condom use [2]. In the PROUD trial 
that tested immediate vs deferred PrEP initiation, there were 
increases in reported risk behavior for those on PrEP but no 
differences in the STI incidence rates between the arms [7]. In 
that population, STI rates were high at baseline and continued 
to rise during the study in both arms [8]. Similar behavioral 
and epidemiological trends were observed in the iPERGAY 
open-label extension for on-demand PrEP [9]. Understanding 
whether RC alone could reproduce the STI incidence differen-
tial observed in the metaanalysis would help provide evidence 
for the causal explanation [4].
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clin-
ical practice guidelines for PrEP outline behavioral indications 
for prescription and recommend biannual STI screening after 
PrEP initiation [10]. Although PrEP medication does not bio-
logically lower bacterial STI acquisition risk, STI screening that 
accompanies PrEP may detect and facilitate treatment of STIs 
that would otherwise go undetected, including asymptomatic 
rectal NG and CT, thus preventing onward transmission of STIs 
[11]. Questions remain about how to optimize the guidelines 
with respect to the STI screening interval, since an estimated 
34%–41% of incident STI cases could be missed if screened 
biannually compared to quarterly [12].
In this study, we used mathematical modeling to address 
these questions about the potential causal effects and the public 
health impact of PrEP on bacterial STI incidence among MSM. 
Our research aim was to estimate how 2 potentially counter-
acting phenomena surrounding PrEP use—behavioral change 
and ongoing STI screening—could interact to either increase or 
decrease the incidence of rectal and urogenital NG and CT in 
this population.
METHODS
This study extends our mathematical models investigating 
HIV transmission dynamics among MSM in the United States 
[13] and the impact of PrEP on preventing new infections [14, 
15]. We developed this model within the EpiModel software 
platform (www.epimodel.org), which provides tools for mod-
eling HIV over complex sexual networks with the statistical 
framework of temporal exponential random graph models 
[16]. For this study, our additions were to build the model 
structure, parameterization, and analysis methods for rectal 
and urogenital NG and CT infection, alongside HIV infection. 
Full details on the methods for this model are provided in the 
Appendix.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transmission and Progression
Our model simulated the dynamics of main, casual, and one-
time MSM sexual partnerships, with behavioral model param-
eters estimated from sexual network data [17, 18]. Predictors 
of partnership formation and dissolution varied by partnership 
type, number of current ongoing partnerships, age mixing, and 
sorting by receptive vs insertive sexual position. For main and 
casual partnerships, there was a hazard of relationship dissol-
ution that reflected their median durations. The model simu-
lated HIV seroadaptive behavior by which men changed their 
rates of condom use depending on HIV testing histories and 
disclosure of HIV status within partnerships.
HIV progression followed the natural history of disease, 
including modifications by antiretroviral therapy (ART) [19]. 
Persons progressed through disease stages in the absence of 
ART with evolving HIV viral loads that modified the rate of 
HIV transmission in discordant pairs [20]. Other factors that 
modified the transmission probability of HIV per sexual act 
included current NG or CT infection, condom use [21], recep-
tive vs insertive sexual position [22], and circumcision for an 
HIV-negative insertive partner [23]. After infection, persons 
were assigned into clinical care trajectories controlling rates 
of HIV diagnosis, ART initiation, and HIV viral suppression 
to match empirical estimates [24]. ART was associated with 
decreased viral load [25] and extended lifespan [26].
Sexually Transmitted Infection Transmission and Recovery
NG and CT transmission was simulated along the same part-
nership network as HIV, but with disease recovery through 
either natural clearance or antibiotic treatment [27]. STI 
transmission was directional and site-specific during AI. For 
example, receptive AI with a partner infected with urethral 
NG was necessary for a new rectal NG infection. Men could be 
infected at both anatomical sites and with both NG and CT. The 
symptomatic status of the newly acquired infections depended 
on site of infection, with most rectal infections asymptomatic 
and most urethral infections symptomatic [28]. STI symptoms 
influenced the probability of testing and treatment, modify-
ing the recovery rate from infection [29]. The base (no PrEP) 
models assumed no routine, interval-based screening for 
asymptomatic STIs, although we relaxed that assumption in 
sensitivity analyses. Treatment for an STI at one anatomical site 
resulted in effective treatment at the anatomical site for men 
with dual-site infections. The reference intervention models 
assumed no explicit treatment failure, but another sensitivity 
analysis explored suboptimal treatment completion. Given 
uncertainty in estimates for parameters that govern site- and 
disease-specific transmission risks, rates of clinical encounters, 
and duration of infection with and without treatment, we used 
a Bayesian approach [30] to define prior distributions for these 
model parameters and fit the model to empirical estimates of 
NG/CT incidence among MSM in the non-PrEP cohorts of the 
metaanalysis [4].
Preexposure Prophylaxis Uptake and Clinical Encounters

lines [10], which indicate HIV-uninfected MSM for PrEP on 4

status–unknown partnership; CAI outside of a monogamous 
partnership; AI in a known HIV-discordant partnership; and 
a recent STI diagnosis [14]. Exhibiting any one of these within 
the 6 months prior to assessment clinically indicated a man for 
PrEP. PrEP adherence was based on data for US MSM; 21.1% 
of men were categorized as nonadherent (0 pills/week), 7.0% 
as taking fewer than 2 pills/week (low adherence), 10.0% at 2–3 
pills/week (moderate adherence), and 61.9% at 4+ pills/week 
(higher adherence) [3]. PrEP use reduced HIV infection prob-
ability in these adherence groups by 0%, 31%, 81%, and 95%, 
respectively [31]. Consistent with the guidelines, men were 
reassessed every 12 months for indications and discontinued 
from PrEP if they no longer exhibited any indications or if they 
were diagnosed with HIV.
Our primary analysis varied 2 PrEP parameters: cover-
age level and behavioral RC. Coverage was the proportion of 
PrEP-indicated men currently using PrEP at any time, with a 
reference value of 40% consistent with previous models [14, 15, 
32]. Probability of condom use in a given sexual act was driven 
by the PrEP user when RC, the reduction in the probability of 
condom use during AI following initiation of PrEP, occurred. 
RC was modeled continuously from 0% (no reduction) to 100% 
(full elimination of condoms), with a reference value of 40% [2].
HIV and STI screening were simulated based on the CDC 
PrEP guidelines, that is, HIV testing every 3 months and STI 
testing every 6 months after initiating PrEP. We varied the STI 
screening interval from 1 to 12 months in sensitivity analyses, 
and the fraction of screened men who successfully completed 
their STI treatment from 100% (reference) to 0%. To isolate the 
performance of the PrEP indications as a method to target STI 
screening, additional scenarios simulated random screening of 
asymptomatic STIs. Over all PrEP scenarios, men with sympto-
matic STIs continued to receive treatment at the same rates as 
the base (no-PrEP) scenario.
Simulation and Analysis
We established pre-PrEP equilibrium in disease prevalence and 
incidence in an open population of 10 000 MSM by calibrating 
the model to NG and CT incidence from the non-PrEP cohorts 
in the metaanalysis (4.2 and 6.6 per 100 PYAR, respectively) [4], 
and HIV prevalence (26%) estimated from one of the cohorts 
with available baseline prevalence data, consistent with our 
previous model [14]. Each model scenario, including the base 
no-PrEP model, was then simulated 250 times over 10 years. 
Primary outcomes were NG and CT incidence per 100 PYAR 
and hazard ratios, both of which were calculated across the final 
year of the time series; percent of infections averted (PIA) com-
pared to base model, which was a function of cumulative inci-
dence over the full 10-year time series; and the number needed 
to treat (NNT) on PrEP to prevent 1 new NG or CT infection. 
Given the model stochasticity, we calculated the medians and 
interquartile range of the simulated data for each outcome.
RESULTS
Table 1 and Figure 1 show NG and CT incidence across levels 
of PrEP coverage and RC. In Table 1, scenarios varying cover-
age hold RC constant at its 40% reference value, while scenarios 
varying RC hold coverage constant at its 40% reference value. 
Higher PrEP coverage was associated with lower incidence of 
both NG and CT. Incidence followed similar relative declines 
for both infections by coverage levels. Over 10 years, PrEP was 
predicted to prevent 42% and 40% of cumulative NG and CT 
infections, respectively.
At RC levels lower than 40%, STI incidence declined further, 
to hazard ratios of 0.11 and 0.17 for NG and CT under 0% RC. 
Increasing RC would partially offset the STI prevention benefits 
associated with PrEP but more so for NG than CT. At extreme 
levels of RC, the PIA for NG became negative in some simula-
tions as the incidence approached or exceeded incidence in the 
base model. In the interaction (Figure 1), RC would need to be 
nearly 90% at 40% coverage for no NG incidence reduction, 
whereas CT incidence always remained lower than in the base 
model except for extreme levels of RC and coverage. Complete 
RC (total elimination of condoms) always resulted in a net reduc-
tion in NG and CT incidence when PrEP coverage exceeded 50%.
In the reference scenario, PrEP was associated with an NNT 
of 7.2 for NG and 4.6 for CT. The NNT grew with increasing 
PrEP coverage; the efficiency of the intervention (PrEP-related 
STI screening) decreased as fewer PrEP users were infected 
with STIs over time. At extreme levels of RC, the NNT became 
negative for NG as the incidence approached or exceeded the 
levels in the base model.
Because PrEP medication was assumed to have no biological 
effect on NG and CT acquisition risk, the observed prevention 
benefits were attributable only to the increased STI screening 
and treatment associated with ongoing PrEP use. Table 2 and 
Figure 2 demonstrate these mechanisms. Here we aggregated 
NG and CT incidence and held both PrEP coverage and RC 
constant at the values in the reference analyses (both 40%). 
With biannual screening, the PrEP intervention treated 17% 
more asymptomatic infections and 16% more rectal infections 
compared to the base model. This form of STI screening was 
associated with a 67% decline in combined STI incidence (1.77 
vs 5.32) among all MSM, despite the higher behavioral risk 
resulting from RC in PrEP users. Reducing the STI screening 
interval from 6 months to 3 months would increase the number 
of asymptomatic urethral and rectal cases treated. This increase 
in STI screening and treatment would result in a further 50% 
reduction in STI incidence (from 1.77 to 0.89).
Reductions in the proportion of MSM who successfully com-
pleted STI treatment under PrEP STI screening (held fixed at 
100% above) increased STI incidence. At the extreme, where 
no MSM on PrEP completed STI treatment, combined STI 
incidence was 13.40. This 2.5-fold hazard compared to the base

model was attributable to RC in the PrEP users. Under a more 
realistic scenario where 75% successfully completed treatment, 
STI incidence at 3.23 would still be 39% lower than in the 
base model.
Finally, in the reference PrEP scenario, 17.3% of men with 
asymptomatic infection would be screened and treated, result-
ing in a population-level STI incidence of 1.77. Even if slightly 
more asymptomatic men were screened (20% vs 17%), but

PrEP users, STI incidence was 4.65, 2.6 times as high, but still 
lower than in the base model. Random STI screening confers 
STI prevention benefits, but not nearly as much as using the 
bio-behavioral indications for targeting PrEP recommended 
within the CDC guidelines.

 STI Incidence Following HIV PrEP Among MSM • CID 2017:65 (1 September) • 717
DISCUSSION
Implementation of the CDC PrEP guidelines could result in a 
significant decline in STI incidence among MSM in the United 
States, with 42% of NG infections and 40% of CT infections 
predicted to be prevented over the next decade. As PrEP has 
no biological effect on bacterial STI risk, the incidence reduc-
tion forecast by our model was attributable only to the recom-
mended ongoing screening and treatment of STIs as part of 
the broader PrEP intervention. This screening would result in 
a substantial increase in treatment for STIs that often remain 
undiagnosed, that is, asymptomatic rectal NG and CT.
The potential for PrEP to increase STI incidence was a public 
health concern even before the completion of the clinical tri-
als that established its efficacy [33]. The hypothesized cause for 
increased STI incidence would be different forms of RC, includ-
ing an increase in the number of partners, greater clustering of 
higher-risk men, or a reduction in condom use with existing 
partners [1]. Few studies have found behavioral evidence for RC 
[3], but one that has suggested the predominant form of RC is 
reduced condom use [2]. In our model, we adopted their upper 
bound of observed condom-related RC in our PrEP scenarios as 
a reference value to predict the impact of this phenomenon on 
STI incidence. Our models demonstrate that even a doubling 
of this observed RC value among PrEP users would result in a 
net prevention benefit for STIs; that benefit increases as PrEP 
coverage grows.
We were unable to reproduce, even under extreme levels of 
RC, the NG and CT incidence rates approaching 40 per 100 PY 
for PrEP users estimated in the metaanalysis [4]. Therefore, our 
results suggest that the considerably higher STI incidence rates 
in the PrEP cohorts compared to non-PrEP cohorts were not 
a causal effect of RC but more likely an issue of study design 
whereby the MSM in the 2 comparison groups were not sam-
pled from the same underlying MSM population. This selec-
tion bias may have resulted from PrEP studies’ need to recruit 
higher-risk MSM to achieve sufficient power to test efficacy 
hypotheses in clinical trials and maximize PrEP benefit in 
demonstration projects. Secular trends in STI incidence and 
increased STI detection in the PrEP cohorts could also bias the 
comparisons [1, 3, 7]. A recent commentary by Harawa et al. on 
the meta-analysis discusses these potential biases and others in 
further detail [34].
Our model results have important implications for the role of 
PrEP as an intervention for STI prevention. Building on prior 
models that estimated the impact of CDC’s PrEP guidelines for 
HIV incidence [14], we aimed to assess the potentially coun-
teracting forces between higher behavioral risk and more STI 
screening after initiation of PrEP. Prevention of NG and CT 
among MSM is complicated by the high prevalence of asympto-
matic rectal infection [35], which allows for reinfection within 
ongoing sexual partnerships even if symptomatic urogenital 
infection is controlled [36].
Previous models have explored the impact and cost-effective-
ness of NG/CT screening outside of PrEP on disease incidence 
among MSM [37]. Our study suggests that CDC’s recom-
mended indications for PrEP initiation may be well suited for 
targeting STI screening to high-risk MSM. Consistent with 
empirical data [12], we found that decreasing the STI screening 
interval from 6 months to 3 months could identify even more 
incident infections that would otherwise go undiagnosed and 
untreated, suggesting more frequent PrEP-related screening 
may be needed. These results underscore the critical role of cli-
nicians in performing the STI screening and treatment recom-
mendations among their current PrEP patients, as we predicted 
STI incidence could increase if the proportion of PrEP users 
treated for STIs fell below 50%.
The study limitations include modeling urogenital and 
rectal NG and CT infections (along with HIV) but no other 
STIs among MSM, such as syphilis [38]. Syphilis incidence 
has increased among US MSM over the past 5 years [39], but 
rates are still substantially lower than GC and CT incidence 
according to case surveillance data as well as comparisons in 
the PrEP metaanalysis, where NG/CT incidence was 6 times 
higher than syphilis in the non-PrEP cohorts and 3 times 
higher in the PrEP cohorts. NG and CT were modeled only 
as uncomplicated infections of the urethra and rectum, miss-
ing pharyngeal and disseminated infections. Pharyngeal-only 
NG and CT infections are less common in this population [35, 
40] but they may serve as a reservoir for rectal and urogenital 
infections modeled in our analysis [41]. Our models also did 
not explicitly simulate STI treatment failure, although the ana-
lysis on proportion successfully treated could be a proxy. We 
only modeled RC as a reduction in condom use, a decision 
based on the best empirical data for US MSM [2], but mode-
ling other forms of RC could lead to different results. Finally, 
some of the parameters for the dynamic network models were 
derived from empirical studies of MSM in Atlanta, Georgia, 
that, although similar to national data [42], may not be fully 
representative.
CONCLUSIONS
This study highlights the design of PrEP not only as daily 
antiretroviral medication but as a combination HIV/STI pre-
vention package that incorporates STI screening and treat-
ment. MSM who are at substantial risk for HIV and therefore 
indicated for PrEP are also at substantial risk for STIs through 
the same sexual partnership networks and behaviors. PrEP, as 
a package prescribed and administered following CDC guide-
lines that include ongoing STI screening, could be an effective 
STI prevention intervention.
