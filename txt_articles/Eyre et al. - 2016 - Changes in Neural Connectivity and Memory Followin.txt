Abstract.
Background: No study has explored the effect of yoga on cognitive decline and resting-state functional connectivity.
Objectives: This study explored the relationship between performance on memory tests and resting-state functional connec-
tivity before and after a yoga intervention versus active control for subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Methods: Participants (≥55 y) with MCI were randomized to receive a yoga intervention or active “gold-standard” control
(i.e., memory enhancement training (MET)) for 12 weeks. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used
to map correlations between brain networks and memory performance changes over time. Default mode networks (DMN),
language and superior parietal networks were chosen as networks of interest to analyze the association with changes in verbal
and visuospatial memory performance.
Results: Fourteen yoga and 11 MET participants completed the study. The yoga group demonstrated a statistically significant
improvement in depression and visuospatial memory. We observed improved verbal memory performance correlated with
increased connectivity between the DMN and frontal medial cortex, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, right middle frontal
cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and left lateral occipital cortex. Improved verbal memory performance positively correlated
with increased connectivity between the language processing network and the left inferior frontal gyrus. Improved visuospatial
memory performance correlated inversely with connectivity between the superior parietal network and the medial parietal
cortex.
Conclusion: Yoga may be as effective as MET in improving functional connectivity in relation to verbal memory performance.
These findings should be confirmed in larger prospective studies.

INTRODUCTION
The global population is aging at a rate unprece-
dented in human history. This increase in aging,
whereby over 2 billion people will be ≥ 60 years of
age by 2050 [1], will obviously be paralleled by a rise

in age-related cognitive impairments. Mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) has been noted to range between
10–20% in samples of population-based studies of
older adults [2]. Individuals with MCI have a 2.5-
fold high risk for developing all-cause dementia, and
MCI is often a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
[2]. MCI is thought to represent a continuum between
healthy aging and AD [3], and thus can be used as
models for preventive interventions. As such, there
is increasing interest in the neural circuits and other
factors that affect and predict progress to AD; as well
as novel interventions.
Yoga is one such technique that is rapidly gaining
interest and popularity in the West (although it has
been used in the East for thousands of years), mainly
being used by millions of people for stress-reduction,
according to surveys. For example, in England there
was a rise from 0.46 to 1.11% of population between
1999 and 2008 [4]; and in the US, 2012 data sug-
gests 9.5% of the US population uses yoga therapies
[5]. New data is now suggesting that mind-body
interventions including yoga, tai chi, mindfulness
meditation, and qi gong, have promising effects on
cognitive issues related to aging [6–8]. A recent study
by Gothe et al. [9] compared the effects of Hatha
yoga and stretching-strengthening control on cogni-
tion over 8 weeks in 118 community-dwelling older
adults, and found significantly improved executive
function, working memory and efficiency of mental-
set shifting and flexibility in the yoga group compared
with the control group. A study by Hariprasad
et al. [10] compared yoga with waitlist controls over
6 months among 87 residents of nursing homes in
India. Findings showed that individuals in the yoga
intervention group showed marked improvements in
an array of cognitive domains compared to wait-list
controls.
However, there are no studies to date examining
functional brain connectivity in relation to memory
following a yoga intervention among older adults
[11].InapreviouspilotstudyusingKirtanKriya(KK,
a meditation that involves chanting mantra, hand
movements, and visualization), older family demen-
tia caregivers showed significant improvements in
cognition, memory, and brain metabolism compared
to a relaxation control condition [12]. A pilot study by
Wells et al. [13] explored the effect of mindfulness-
based stress reduction (MBSR) versus usual care
on neural outcomes among 14 MCI subjects. They
explored resting state functional magnetic resonance
imaging (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI data around
the default mode network (DMN) and hippocampus,
and found enhanced DMN activity and lesser bilateral
hippocampal atrophy. These results are very relevant
forsubjectswithMCIandAD,whichtypicallyaffects
DMN and hippocampus very early in the disease pro-
cess, and some have used these are early markers of
AD [14].
Memory enhancement training (MET) is another
technique that has been increasingly explored for the
prevention of cognitive decline, and is thus consid-
ereda‘gold-standard’andrigorouscontrolforstudies
of cognitive impairment. The goal of MET is to opti-
mize cognitive function to support individuals’ life
functioning and quality of life [15]. There is evidence
suggesting that MET promotes significant improve-
ments in cognitive performance among healthy, older
adults [16]; however there is no clear consensus on
the mechanisms of action underlying reported bene-
fits [17]. A number of systematic reviews have been
conducted on the effects of MET in individuals with
MCI. For example, one review by Jean et al. [18]
analyzed 15 studies and found effects on memory,
and quality and life. Simon et al. [19] explored this
field for amnestic MCI patient and ground effects on
cognitive performance and subjective perceptions of
cognition. There are no studies to date exploring the
effect of MET on rs-fMRI.
To our knowledge, yoga has never been compared
to MET in a direct head-to-head comparative clinical
trial and this has not occurred with in vivo imaging
biomarkers. In this preliminary study of KK medita-
tion (with weekly Kundalini yoga classes as boosters)
and MET, we explored associations between memory
improvements and functional plasticity in brain net-

the relationship between changes in neural functional
connectivity and changes in memory performance.
METHODS
Data were collected for the “Memory Training
Versus Yogic Meditation Training in Older Adults
with Subjective Memory Complaints and MCI” study
at UCLA from 2013 to 2015 (NCT01983930). This
12-week randomized trial examined the cognitive
effects of MET versus KY+KK in older adults with
memory concerns and a CDR of 0.5.
Participants
Participants were recruited via advertisements
from UCLA outpatient clinics and the UCLA Long-
evity Center Program, and from the community.

This study was approved by the UCLA Institutional
Review Board (IRB). All participants underwent
IRB-approved informed consent procedures prior to
enrolling in the study.
Inclusion criteria were: 1) age ≥ 55 years; 2) sub-
jective memory complaints; 3) Clinical Dementia
Rating (CDR) Scale score of 0.5 [20]; 3) sufficient
English proficiency at the 8th grade level or higher
as determined by the word reading subtest of the
Wide Range Achievement Test-4 [21] to participate
in MET; 4) capacity to provide informed consent.
Exclusion criteria included: 1) current or past
Axis I psychiatric disorders, or recent unstable med-
ical or neurological disorders; 2) any disabilities
preventing participation in the MET or KY+KK con-
ditions (e.g., severe visual or hearing impairment);
3) insufficient English proficiency; 4) a diagnosis of
dementia per the DSM-IV/5; 5) Mini-Mental Health
Examination (MMSE) [22] score of 24 or below;
6) use of psychoactive medications; 7) participation
in a psychotherapy that involves cognitive training;
and 8) participants with prior or current training in
yoga.
At baseline, participants underwent a screen
including: 1) an interview by a trained study staff
to identify physical and cognitive symptoms; 2) a
standard battery of hematologic studies; 3) neuro-
logical examination (i.e., the Unified Parkinson’s
Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) [23]; 3) select mem-
ory tests (the Fluid Object Memory Evaluation [24];
and4)aneuropsychiatricevaluation(StructuredClin-
ical Interview for DSM Disorders) [25]; 5) medical
comorbidity was assessed with the Cerebrovascular
Risk Factor Prediction Chart [26]; the Cumulative
Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric [23, 27–30]; 6) mood
assessments included the Geriatric Depression Scale
(GDS) [31].
Randomization and blinding procedures
After all baseline test results were reviewed and
eligibility criteria were confirmed, subjects were
randomized to either MET or KY groups using
a computer-generated random assignment scheme,
which assigns subjects in a 1:1 ratio to each group
in the blocks of 8–10 subjects. All groups were
called “wellness and mental stimulation” groups. All
behavioral raters, the principal investigator, all statis-
ticians and data managers were blind to the group
assignment, and subjects were asked not to disclose
their group assignment to the raters. No unblinding
occurred in the process of assessment.
Neuropsychological assessment schedule
Participants were assessed at baseline (pre-
treatment) and at 12-weeks (post-treatment). While
an extensive neuropsychological battery was admin-
istered for the full trial, the focus of this research
was to identify the neural networks associated with
memory improvements resulting from a meditation
(KK) and MET among older individuals with MCI.
The following memory tests were used: A verbal
list-learning measure, the Hopkins Verbal Learning
Test–Revised (HVLT-R) [32] (20-min delay recall
raw scores) and a visuospatial memory measure,
the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Test (Rey-O) (30-min
delay recall raw scores) [33]. Only HVLT and
Rey-O delayed recall change scores were corre-
lated with connectivity changes in this study to
compare the effects of interventions on network
connectivity specifically associated with long-term
memory.
Yoga intervention
Participants were randomly assigned to the KK
meditation group (which included 60-min weekly
KY classes and a 12-min KK meditation daily
as a homework assignment). The structure of the
60-min weekly yoga sessions were the same for each
group and standard for KY classes conducted by a
certified KY yoga teacher. The content and struc-
ture of the class did not differ from one week to
another and contained the following elements: 1)
Tuning in (5 min); 2) Warm up (10 min); 3) Breath
techniques “Pranayama” (10 min); 4) Kriya (20 min);
5) Meditation (11 min); 6) Rest “Shavasana” and
closing (4 min). KK was taught during the class
using standardized CDs for the 12-min meditation.
Standardized handouts and CDs were given to each
participant for home practice. This protocol is stan-
dard for the KK and KY practice and has been
utilized in previous studies with older adults [34]. A
brief (3–5 min) warm-up with 12-min yogic practice
includes an ancient chanting meditation, KK, per-
formed every day at the same time for a total of
12 weeks, using a previously tested protocol. The
meditation involves repetitive finger movements (or
mudras), as well as chanting of the mantra “Saa,
Taa, Naa, Maa,” meaning “Birth, Life, Death, and
Rebirth,” first chanted aloud, then in a whisper, and
silently for the total of 11 min followed by 1-min of
the final deep breathing relaxation accompanied by
the visualization of light [35]. Adverse events were

monitored at each visit by using the UKU Side Effect
Rating Scale [36].
Memory enhancement training
Developed at the UCLA Longevity Center by Dr.
Ercoli and colleagues, MET involves a scripted cur-
riculum for trainers and a companion workbook for
participants. The standard detailed protocol for the
MET program is based on evidence-based techniques
that use verbal and visual association strategies and
practical strategies for memory compensation [16,
37]. MET is manualized and includes several compo-
nentscommontoeffectivememorytrainingprograms
[16] such as: (1) education about memory; (2) pre-
liminary instruction in the basic elements of memory
strategies (i.e., “pre-training”); (3) instruction in spe-
cific memory strategies; (4) home practice with logs
to track activity; (5) addressing non-cognitive fac-
tors such as self-confidence, anxiety, and negative
expectations; and (6) small (i.e., about 10 persons)
groups and short (60-min) sessions. The curriculum
is divided into 12 weekly-sessions that are organized
in the same way in which trainers: (1) document the
number of participants attending the session, collect
homework completion logs and assess engagement
in alternative treatments; (2) review the previous ses-
sion’s homework to reinforce techniques; (3) teach
new techniques, reviews, and conduct in-class exer-
cises; and (4) assign homework. Each session is
devoted to learning and practicing techniques, and
15 min are reserved for reviewing homework. Spe-
cific techniques taught include: Visual associative
strategies for learning faces and names (adapted from
McCarthy [38]); verbal associative techniques (such
as the use of stories) to remember lists; organizational
strategies (categorizing items on a grocery list); learn-
ing memory habits to recall where one places items,
what one has done in the recent past (e.g., locking
doors, turning off appliances); and how to remember
future tasks (i.e., appointments).
Neuroimaging acquisition and preprocessing
Image acquisition
Resting-state (rs) fMRI data were collected with
a 3T TIM Trio scanner (Siemens AG, Munich &
Berlin, Germany) at baseline and at 12-weeks (imme-
diately post-intervention). Participants’ heads were
positioned comfortably within a 32-channel head
coil, and head motion was minimized with firm cush-
ions. We instructed participants to close their eyes
and stay awake during image acquisition. RS-fMRI
images were acquired for 5 min and 41 s with a
multi-band gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI)
sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast effects. We
acquired 275 contiguous EPI resting-state volumes,
and the parameters for functional imaging were: Rep-
etition time 1.24 s, echo time 38.2 ms, flip angle 65◦,
field of view 21.2 × 21.2 cm2, acquisition matrix
118 × 118, 1.8 mm3 iso-voxel size (no gap), 78 slices,
and 6 bands. We also acquired anatomic images with
3-dimensional
MPRAGE
sequence
(acquisition
matrix 256 × 256 with 1 mm thick contiguous slices)
for co-registration with the rs-fMRI data.
Image preprocessing
Brain imaging data were pre-processed using
FSL (FMRIB Software Library (FSL, www.fmrib.ox.
ac.uk/fsl) for motion correction, high-pass filter
(0.01 Hz), image normalization and 5-mm3 Gaus-
sian spatial smoothing. MELODIC (Multivariate
Exploratory Linear Decomposition into Independent
Components, a tool of FSL) was used to remove
significant brain motion, scanner, and physiologi-
cal artifacts using independent component analysis
(ICA). The processed functional data from all par-
ticipants were temporally concatenated to form a
4-dimensional data set, which was decomposed into
group-level independent components (ICs) using
ICA as implemented in MELODIC. The MELODIC
automated dimensionality estimate was used to
determine the number and order of the ICs [39].
Twenty-five ICs were identified with this method.
Each component includes brain structures that share
the same temporal pattern of signal after mix-
ture modeling was applied. The dual regression
approach was subsequently used to back-reconstruct
individual-specificconnectivitymapsassociatedwith
each group-level component, which been shown to
be an effective and reliable approach to analyses of
resting state fMRI data [40]. This approach yielded
36 ICs; 26 of these overlapped grey matter and
were considered biologically plausible and consid-
ered for subsequent statistical analysis (described
below).

of 0.05, two-tailed was used for all inferences.
The present study focused primarily on 4 ICs for
analyses, based on group level ICs relevant to the
tests of long-term memory, including: The DMN,
posterior DMN, language network, and superior pari-
etal network. For each IC, we analyzed correlations
between voxel-wise changes in network connectiv-
ity and changes in memory performance across all
the participants (using years of education, age, sex,
and days of training duration as covariates). These
analyses were restricted to component-specific masks
generated by thresholding the group-level IC proba-
bility image to voxels having 0.5 or higher probability
of contributing to each IC map. Voxel-wise thresh-
olds were chosen at z < 2.3 p < 0.01, and corrected
for cluster-size using Random Field Theory at p
(corr) < 0.05. Finally, we conducted post-hoc region
of interest (ROI) analyses, assessing correlations
for each intervention group (yoga and MET) sep-
arately between changes in functional connectivity
and changes in memory scores. In these post-hoc
ROI analyses, outliers were identified using Cook’s
distance (d) and removed as appropriate.
RESULTS
Figure 1 presents the Consolidated Standards of
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) flow. Groups were
statistically equivalent across all measures at base-
line. Table 1 presents the baseline clinical and
demographic characteristics of the intervention.
Twenty-five individuals total were involved in this
study with: 14 individuals in the yoga group (mean
age of 67.1 ± 9.5 years) and 11 individuals in the
MET group (mean age of 67.8 ± 9.7 years).
Change scores did not significantly differ between
the two groups in most of the clinical or memory mea-
sures; however the yoga group improved significantly
in depression (GDS) and in visuospatial memory
(Rey-O delayed recall). The clinical improvement in
GDS for the yoga group was only minimal (baseline
7.5 (5.1) and follow up 3.9 (2.5); p = 0.01).
In terms of functional connectivity, we focused
our analyses on four components related to long-
term memory (the DMN, posterior DMN, language
network, and superior parietal network). Results
showed significant correlations between changes in
connectivity and long-term declarative memory per-
formance alterations for both groups after training
(p (corr < 0.05). These components are described in
detail in the sections below.

Default mode network findings for yoga
and memory enhancement training
In our analyses, we identified two DMNs. The first
included regions most typically associated with the
DMN, including the precuneus, PCC, ACC, medial
frontal cortex (MFC), and hippocampus. The second
DMN was more posterior and included precuneus,
PCC, lateral parietal cortex, and hippocampus. No
significant effects were identified in this latter poste-
rior DMN. Results within the more typical DMN are
discussed below.
In analyses of the DMN (Fig. 2), improvement
in the HVLT delayed recall in both in yoga and
MET groups correlated with greater connectivity in
two anterior clusters, the pregenual ACC and frontal
medial cortex (FMC). ROI analyses confirmed the
effects were present in both groups for the ACC
(R14 = 0.84, p < 0.001 for yoga subjects; R11 = 0.73,
p = 0.011 for MET subjects). The correlations were
still statistically significant after removal of an out-
lier in the yoga group (Cook’s Distance = 0.81)
(R13 = 0.62, p = 0.024 for yoga subjects). Correla-
tions were also significant for both groups in ROI
analyses of the FMC (R14 = 0.91, p < 0.001 for yoga
group; R11 = 0.64, p = 0.035 for MET group). Simi-
larly, the FMC correlation remained significant after
the removal of an outlier in the yoga group (Cook’s
Distance = 2.3)
(R13 = 0.76,
p = 0.002
for
yoga
group). See Fig. 2.
Increased HVLT delayed recall positively corre-
lated with increased DMN-connectivity within two
posterior clusters: The PCC and left lateral occipi-
tal cortex. In ROI analyses, this positive correlation
was present for both groups in the PCC (R14 = 0.78,
p = 0.001 for yoga group; R11 = 0.68, p = 0.02 for
MET group). However, the correlation in the PCC
was not significant after removal of an outlier in
the yoga group (R13 = 0.47, p = 0.106) (Cook’s Dis-
tance = 0.86).IncreasedHVLTdelayedrecallwasalso
correlated with increased connectivity within the left
lateral occipital cortex for both groups in ROI analy-
ses (R14 = 0.81, p < 0.001 for yoga group; R11 = 0.77,
p = 0.005 for MET group). This correlation remained

yoga group (R13 = 0.51, p = 0.077 for yoga group).
An additional cluster in the dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex (middle frontal gyrus) also showed
increased connectivity in association with increased
HVLT delayed recall scores. ROI analyses indicated
the effect was present in both groups (R14 = 0.87,
p < 0.001 for yoga group; R11 = 0.68, p = 0.02 for

after removal of an outlier for the yoga group
(R13 = 0.62, p = 0.025 for yoga group) (Cook’s
Distance = 3.1).

group; dashed lines indicate trendlines without the outlier (marked with a black circle) for the yoga group.
Language network findings for yoga and memory
enhancement training
The language resting-state network included the
bilateral frontal orbital cortex, superior frontal gyrus,
left middle and inferior frontal gyrus, dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex, left middle and superior temporal
gyrus, and angular gyrus. Subjects showed positive
correlations between long-term verbal memory per-
formance changes and altered functional connectivity
in one cluster, the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG).
ROI analyses indicated that this positive correlation
was present for both groups (R14 = 0.82, p < 0.001 for
yoga group; R11 = 0.55, p = 0.079 for MET group).
However, the correlation was not significant after
removal of an outlier for the yoga group (R13 = 0.42,
p = 0.15). See Fig. 3.
Superior parietal network findings for yoga
and memory enhancement training
The superior parietal network (known for its role
in long-term and working memory [41]) included
the bilateral PCC, precuneus, precentral and post-
central gyrus, and parietal operculum cortex. With
respect to this network, a single cluster near the
precentral and postcentral gyri exhibited a negative
relationship between changes in functional connec-
tivity and changes in long-term visuospatial memory
performance. In an ROI analysis, both the yoga and
MET groups showed significant effects in this cluster
(R14 = –0.59, p = 0.028 for yoga group; R11 = –0.73,
p = 0.011 for MET group). See Fig. 4.
DISCUSSION
The present study was the first to examine changes
in neural connectivity and memory associated with a
yoga intervention (specifically KK) and MET among
a group of elderly individuals experiencing MCI.
Overall, we found comparable changes for both yoga
and MET in neural connectivity networks associated
with memory performance.
Both the yoga and MET group showed resting-
state brain activity changes reflecting improvements
in memory. Mainly, results showed increased con-
nectivity within DMN and the language network in
association with improved verbal memory perfor-
mance for both Yoga and MET groups. Changes in
the superior parietal network were also negatively

correlated with memory recall improvements. We
discuss these findings in detail below.
The DMN is a network of regions showing syn-
chronized activity patterns when the brain is at-rest
and decreased when the mind is engaged in the exter-
nal environment [42, 43]. The DMN includes areas
in the medial prefrontal cortex, the PCC, precuneus
and medial temporal lobe structures including the
hippocampus [44, 45]. Evidence suggests involve-
ment of the DMN in episodic memory retrieval,
prospective memory encoding, social cognition, self-
referential processing, including self-prospecting
and internal monitoring, autobiographical memory
retrieval, future planning, and theory of mind
[45–47]. Some research suggests that the DMN is
the main rs-fMRI network affected in aging [48–51],
showing reductions in connectivity between ante-
rior and posterior nodes [48, 49, 52–56]. Decreased
DMN connectivity has been noted in AD [57] and
involves areas affected by cerebral atrophy, reduced
metabolism, and amyloid in AD and MCI [58]. The
suggestion for alterations of DMN connectivity has
been previously attributed to inefficiency reallocation
of brain resources. From a neuroanatomical perspec-
tive this may be due to poorer cingulum bundle
integrity which connects posterior to anterior and

temporal DMN nodes [59]. Poorer antero-posterior
connectivity was recently correlated with visual and
verbal memory scores in a study of 116 healthy elders
[55].
Our study findings suggest that yoga may be
helpful in enhancing memory recall, specifically
visual memory encoding. However, we acknowl-
edge that practice effects may factor into observed
improvements. Moreover, these findings suggest that
improved memory recall is associated with increased
DMN connectivity in anterior, posterior and frontal
medial areas. Relevant to these findings are a number
of other studies. A pilot study by Wells et al. [13]
explored the effect of MBSR versus usual care on
14 MCI subjects. They explored rs-fMRI and struc-
tural MRI data around the DMN and hippocampus,
respectively. The study found enhanced DMN activ-
ity (increased functional connectivity between the
PCC and medial prefrontal cortices and hippocam-
pus), as well as lesser bilateral hippocampal atrophy.
These results are promising given that these regions
are associated with MCI and AD. Yoga is believed to
exert its effect via lowering stress, lowering inflam-
mation, enhancing neuroplasticity processes (e.g.,
production of brain derived neurotrophic factor),
increasing antioxidant levels and increasing telom-
erase activity [12, 60–64].
A number of studies have explored the effect
of meditative therapies on the DMN, supporting
the present study findings. For example, Taylor
et al. [65] recently compared DMN functional con-
nectivity between 13 experienced meditators and
11 beginner meditators; and found that experi-
enced meditators had weaker functional connectivity
between DMN regions involved in self-referential
processing and emotional appraisal, however they
showed greater connectivity in regions associated
with present-moment awareness. It is likely that
present-moment awareness facilitates verbal mem-
ory, processing and recall as the individual is
attentive to the moment. Brewer et al. [66] con-
ducted a similar analysis of experienced meditators
versuss meditation-na¨
ive controls across a number
of difference meditation types, i.e., concentration,
loving-kindness, and choice-less awareness. Expe-
rienced meditators showed deactivation in the main
nodes of the DMN (MFC and PCC) across all medi-
tation types; as well as stronger coupling between the
PC, dorsal ACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices
at both baseline and during meditation. This suggests
enhanced efficiency of self-monitoring and cogni-
tive control among experienced meditators. Given
the complex nature of KK meditation (as it involves
chanting, hand movements, and visualization), we
believe that it engages language, visual and frontal
networks important for self-regulation resulting in
enhanced verbal and visual memory as shown in the
present study. Other proposed potential mechanisms
are via stress reduction and increased global atten-
tion/awareness.
Improved visual-spatial memory performance cor-
related inversely with connectivity in the superior
parietal network, which has been shown to be asso-
ciated with attention, translation of visual to motor
information, and working memory [41, 67]. It is
possible that these network connectivity changes
reflect enhanced efficiency of connectivity between
the relevant brain regions (i.e., between the bilateral
posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus cortex, pre-
central, postcentral gyrus, and parietal operculum
cortex). The less-wiring-more-firing hypothesis sug-
gests that greater activity of neurons in older age
compensates for impaired white-matter connectivity,
that there is an over-recruitment of neuronal activity
for functional compensation [68]. In this study, we
suggest that yoga improves white-matter connectiv-
ity thereby reducing neuronal activity with the result
of improved visuospatial memory performance. This
hypothesis can be tested more accurately with the use
of diffusion tensor imaging which measures white-
matter integrity.
Although there are several limitations we believe
that the findings are promising, as we used strong
control group (MET) and found significant connec-
tivity changes even with a small sample size that are
in-line with previous findings. The sample size was
only powered towards rs-fMRI findings, and explor-
ing relationships between memory and functional
connectivity, not exploring multi-domain effects on
cognition. Additionally, we do not have long-term
follow-up,whichmeansweareunabletoexplorecog-
nitive decline towards dementia. Also, it is possible
that the enhanced cognitive benefits and connectiv-
ity changes resulting from the KK yogic intervention
were due to the 60 min of instruction per week, the
12 min per day of Kirtan kriya meditation (shown to
positively affect blood flow in the brain [34]), or a
combination of these factors. However, as previous
studies only using KK meditation found activation
patterns that are in-line with those from the present
research, it is unlikely that the weekly classes pre-
sented a large deviation. Nevertheless, this is a fruitful
area for future research studies, which may aim to
parse out the effects of these various activities, or
 682

perhaps determine that for optimal benefits weekly
classes in addition to a daily meditative practice is
recommended.
CONCLUSION
The present study examining resting state neural
connectivity changes among individuals undergoing
a KK yoga intervention versus MET showed that both
were as effective in improving memory functions
(namely memory recall) and functional connectivity-
related to verbal, attentional, and self-regulatory
performance. The improvement in verbal and visuo-
spatial memory performance may be explained by
the use of the components of the chanting mantra
meditation (Kirtan Kriya) with visualization that
may strengthen specific verbal and visual skills, and
enhance global awareness and attention.
