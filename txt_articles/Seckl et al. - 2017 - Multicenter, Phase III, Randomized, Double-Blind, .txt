Purpose
Treating small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a therapeutic challenge. Experimental studies show
that statins exert additive effects with agents, such as cisplatin, to impair tumor growth, and
observational studies suggest that statins combined with anticancer therapies delay relapse and
prolong life in several cancer types. To our knowledge, we report the first large, randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of a statin with standard-of-care for patients with cancer,
specifically SCLC.
Patients and Methods
Patients with confirmed SCLC (limited or extensive disease) and performance status 0 to 3 were
randomly assigned to receive daily pravastatin 40 mg or placebo, combined with up to six cycles of
etoposide plus cisplatin or carboplatin every 3 weeks, until disease progression or intolerable
toxicity. Primary end point was overall survival (OS), and secondary end points were progression-
free survival (PFS), response rate, and toxicity.
Results
Eight hundred forty-six patients from 91 United Kingdom hospitals were recruited. The median age
of recruited patients was 64 years of age, 43% had limited disease, and 57% had extensive disease.
There were 758 deaths and 787 PFS events. No benefit was found for pravastatin, either in all
patients or in several subgroups. For pravastatin versus placebo, the 2-year OS rate was 13.2%
(95% CI, 10.0 to 16.7) versus 14.1% (95% CI, 10.9 to 17.7), respectively, with a hazard ratio of 1.01
(95% CI, 0.88 to 1.16; P = .90. The median OS was 10.7 months v 10.6 months, respectively. The
median PFS was 7.7 months v 7.3 months, respectively. The median OS (pravastatin v placebo) was
14.6 months in both groups for limited disease and 9.1 months versus 8.8 months, respectively, for
extensive disease. Adverse events were similar between groups.
Conclusion
Pravastatin 40 mg combined with standard SCLC therapy, although safe, does not benefit patients.
Our conclusions are the same as those found in all four much smaller, randomized, placebo-
controlled trials specifically designed to evaluate statin therapy in patients with cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15%
to 20% of all new cases of lung cancer worldwide,
with a low median survival of 12 to 14 months
for patients with limited stage disease and 8 to
12 months for those with extensive stage disease.
Although few therapeutic advances have been
made over the past 40 years, there has been much
progress in the understanding of the biologic
processes, including the importance of, for ex-
ample, TP53 and RB1 gene mutations, and the
potential for targeted therapies—for example,
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors and
immunotherapeutics—of which several trials are
ongoing.1
Statins are an inexpensive and established
therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention and
treatment. Despite initial concerns that long-term

 use might increase the risk of developing cancer, large-scale meta-
analyses of randomized trials have shown no excess cancer in-
cidence or mortality2; however, evidence from experimental and
preclinical studies has indicated that statins can inhibit tumor
growth and induce apoptosis in several tumor types, including
pancreatic carcinoma,3 mesothelioma,4 breast cancer,5 and SCLC
cells.6 Mechanistically, mitogen-activated protein kinase and ex-
tracellular signal-regulated kinase upregulates antiapoptotic mol-
ecules in SCLC cells,7,8 and simvastatin can disrupt this process
through impaired Ras superfamily signaling. This is achieved
because statins block 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A
(HMG-CoA) reductase, thereby reducing cholesterol biosynthesis
and impairing geranylation and farnesylation of Ras superfamily
members.6 Statins could therefore act in an additive or synergistic
fashion when combined with chemotherapy agents, such as pac-
litaxel,9 cisplatin,5,10 and doxorubicin.5 Experiments in H-69
human SCLC xenografts in nude mice showed impressive single-
agent activity of orally administered statin.6 Our early studies
implied that statins, such as simvastatin, would enhance the effects
of single-agent or combination chemotherapy, including cisplatin
and etoposide, triggering apoptosis and/or reverse chemo-
resistance.6 These effects were not confined to one platinum type
because atorvastatin has subsequently been shown to enhance
efficacy of carboplatin in non-SCLC cells in vitro and in vivo.11
Furthermore, before our trial, an unblinded randomized trial of
pravastatin in patients with liver cancer reported a striking
9-month increase in overall survival (OS).12
It is worth considering the large body of evidence for statins in
cancer prevention or treatment, which received significant interest
during major conferences held in 2015 and 2016 (ASCO, ASCO-GI,
and the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium). Using large pro-
spective cohort or registry studies, all but one study was positive. The
magnitude of the effects found by these studies, along with study size,
show why they attracted attention: a 22% reduction in cancer deaths
among 146,326 women,13 no effect on breast cancer incidence among
79,518 women,14 40% reduction in prostate deaths among 22,110
high-risk patients with prostate cancer,15 14% reduction in all-cause
mortality in 2,142 patients with pancreatic cancer,16 18% reduction in
recurrence and/or deaths in 8,010 patients with breast cancer,17 and
29% reduction in breast cancer mortality from a meta-analysis of 12
studies covering 87,951 patients with breast cancer.18 There have also
been other large studies that have reported that statins, usually when
still taken after diagnosis, can reduce recurrence or mortality in
patients with esophageal,19 colorectal,20 and lung cancer,21 and all
tumors combined,22 with further evidence from meta-analyses of all
cancers,23 and prostate (postradiotherapy)24,25 and colorectal can-
cer.26 However, all studies were observational and none established
a dose-response for statin efficacy.
We investigated statins for the treatment of SCLC because pa-
tients are treated with platinum and/or etoposide chemotherapy, used
in the earlier experimental work, and the poor prognosis made it
a good candidate for an inexpensive therapy evenwith a modest effect.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Etoposide and Cisplatin or Carboplatin as First-Line Chemotherapy With
or without Pravastatin in Treating Patients with Small-Cell Lung Cancer
(LUNGSTAR) was a pragmatic, randomized (1:1), phase III, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial to investigate whether adding pravastatin to
standard chemotherapy improves OS in patients with SCLC. Investigators
are listed in Appendix Table A1 (online only). The trial had national ethics
approval and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All
patients gave written informed consent.
Patients
Patients age $ 18 years were recruited from 91 United Kingdom
National Cancer Research Network hospitals. Eligibility criteria included
histologically or cytologically confirmed SCLC (limited or extensive dis-
ease), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 3, life
expectancy . 8 weeks, and adequate renal and bone marrow function.
Patients were ineligible if they had mixed cell histology, prior chemo-
radiotherapy for the tumor, history of a malignant tumor, had used statins
within the previous 12 months, or had been treated with fibrates within
4 weeks before random assignment. Patients were randomly assigned by
research nurses after telephoning the University College London Cancer
Trials Centre, using minimization stratified by disease status (limited v
extensive) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
(0 to 1 v 2 to 3).
Pravastatin or matching placebo (40 mg) were administered orally
once per day from the start of chemotherapy for 2 years, unless disease
progression or intolerable toxicity occurred. We used pravastatin because
this seemed to be active in liver cancer12 and, unlike other statins, did not
interact with cytochrome P450 family members, thereby reducing po-
tential important drug interactions.27,28 All patients received standard
treatment every 3 weeks for up to six cycles: etoposide (120 mg/m2 in-
travenously on day 1, then either the same on days 2 and 3 or 100 mg twice
per day orally on days 2 and 3), with either cisplatin (60 mg/m2 in-
travenously on day 1) or carboplatin (on day 1: area under curve [AUC]
5 or 6 using EDTA, or the Cockcroft and Gault method, to assess glomerular
filtration rate). Radiotherapy was administered per local practice. Patients
with limited disease were recommended to have concurrent chemo-
radiotherapy, preferably with the second chemotherapy cycle, or sequential
chemoradiotherapy to the chest (the protocol did not specify dose), with
prophylactic cranial radiation offered to those who achieved a partial re-
sponse or complete tumor response (CR). Patients with extensive disease
and who achieved CR were offered thoracic radiotherapy—recommended
40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks to the mediastinum and 25 Gy in 10
fractions over 2 weeks to the brain. All researchers and patients were
blinded to statin and placebo. Primary care physicians of randomly
assigned patients were contacted and asked not to prescribe statins while
their patient was enrolled in the trial—so we did not collect data on statin
use outside of the study.
Assessments
Clinical examinations, biochemical tests, and chest x-rays were
performed at baseline, before each chemotherapy cycle, then every
2 months for the next year and every 3 months thereafter. Chest and
abdomen computed tomography scans were performed at baseline, at the
end of cycle 3, within 4 weeks of completing chemotherapy, and when
clinically indicated thereafter. Brain scans were performed before random
assignment, where indicated, to exclude patients with brain metastases
who required immediate radiotherapy.
Statistical Analysis
The primary end point was OS, measured from the date of random
assignment until death from any cause. Surviving patients were censored on
the date last known to be alive. Secondary end points were progression-free
survival (PFS), tumor response assessed by the treating clinician (Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v1.0) and toxicity (Com-
mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0). PFS was calculated
from the date of random assignment to the date of first progression or

 death, whichever occurred first. OS and PFS were compared by using
Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for the ran-
domization stratification factors, which were also preplanned subgroup
analyses. Tablet adherence was assessed by a Wilcoxon test. The worst
grade of adverse event for each patient and each toxicity type was used.
All analyses were by intention-to-treat, except for adverse events, which
were reported only for patients who took at least one dose of statin or
placebo.
The trial was designed to detect an improvement in median OS with
hazard ratio (HR) of 0.82 from an expected median in controls of
12 months, which corresponds to a difference in 2-year OS rates of 10%
versus 15%. This required 842 patients (792 deaths) with 80% power and
5% two-sided significance.
RESULTS
Eight hundred forty-six patients were recruited between February
19, 2007 and January 3, 2012 (Fig 1). Of 1,537 patients who were
screened, where screening logs were available, 338 (22%) patients
were ineligible because they were recent or current statin users.
Three randomly assigned patients who were later found to be
ineligible were included in the analyses (intention-to-treat), be-
cause they had already started trial drug, which stopped within
6 months. Baseline characteristics were well balanced (Table 1).
Median follow-up was 39.6 months.
Adherence
The median length of time on study drug was 8.6 months
(pravastatin) and 7.8 months (placebo). Among 725 patients who
started treatment and with available data on number of tablets
dispensed and returned, the median number of tablets reportedly
taken was 210 (pravastatin) and 181 (placebo; P = .38). Similarly,
there was little difference found in the number of tablets returned
(median, 38 and 36, respectively).
The amount of chemotherapy administered was similar be-
tween the two groups (P = .19); in each treatment arm, 57%
received six cycles (Appendix Table A2, online only). There was
little difference in the reasons for stopping chemotherapy early
(Appendix Table A3, online only). The mean number of che-
motherapy cycles was similar between patients with extensive
disease (4.8) and limited disease (4.9).
Appendix Table A4 (online only) summarizes the types of
additional treatments administered to patients after they finished
chemotherapy, which were well balanced between the statin and
placebo arms, and within patients with extensive and limited
disease.
Efficacy
There were 758 deaths. Six hundred ninety-seven (92%)
were a result of SCLC, including six deaths that were considered
to be related to chemotherapy in the pravastatin group and none
in the placebo group; eight deaths were attributed to a combi-
nation of cancer and treatment in the pravastatin arm and six in
the placebo arm.
OS was similar between treatment groups (Fig 2), with medians
of 10.7 months and 10.6 months for pravastatin and placebo, re-
spectively, (unadjusted HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.16; P = .90] and
adjusted for the stratification factors [1.02; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.18;
P = .76]). The corresponding 2-year OS rates were 14.1% (95% CI,
10.9 to 17.7) and 13.2% (95% CI, 10.0 to 16.7), respectively.
There were 787 PFS events. Median PFS was 7.7 months
(pravastatin) versus 7.3 months (placebo), with unadjusted HR of
0.98 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.13; P = .81), and adjusted HR of 1.01 (95%
CI, 0.88 to 1.17; P = .86). The corresponding 1-year PFS rates were
25.3% and 24.2%, respectively; the 2-year PFS rates were 7.5%
(95% CI, 5.2 to 10.3) and 7.2% (95% CI, 4.9 to 10.0), respectively.
Pravastatin also had no effect as a function of disease
extent (Fig 3). Median OS was 14.6 months (pravastatin) versus

Furthermore, no subgroup effects were observed for perfor-
mance status, age, sex, type of platinum therapy administered,
pleural effusion, or presence of affected lymph nodes (Ap-
pendix Fig A1, online only). Allowing for a slight imbalance
between the two arms for type of platinum treatment (Table 1)
made little difference to the results (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90 to
1.19; P = .63).
Tumor response was similar between trial groups with 29
(69.0%) of 422 patients on pravastatin and 293 (69.1%) of 424
patients on placebo achieving a partial or complete (best) overall
response; there was little difference in response rates for limited
and extensive stage disease (Appendix Table A5, online only).

 The number of patients who received thoracic radiotherapy was
similar between trial groups with 202 (47.9%) patients in the prav-
astatin arm and 210 (49.5%) in the placebo arm, with a corresponding
median total dose of 39 Gy (range, 3 to 66) and 40 Gy (range, 2 to 66),
respectively. Furthermore, 203 (48.1%) patients in the pravastatin arm
and 207 (48.8%) patients in the placebo arm received prophylactic
cranial brain irradiation, with corresponding median total dose of
25 Gy (range, 2 to 40) and 25 Gy (range, 2 to 56), respectively.
Adverse Events
Table 2 shows that the distribution of grade 3 to 5 adverse
events was similar between the pravastatin and placebo arms with
333 (81.2%) of 410 patients versus 333 (81.4%) of 409 patients,
respectively (P = .94). The most common grade 3 to 5 adverse event
was neutropenia, which affected 184 (44.9%) of patients in the
pravastatin arm and 176 (43.0%) of patients in the placebo arm.
Myalgia or myositis of any grade—recognized toxicities of statins—
occurred in 74 patients in the pravastatin arm and 77 patients in the
placebo arm; the majority of these were grade 1 or 2, with three
patients who received pravastatin experiencing grade 3 and 4 (three
grade 3, one grade 4) compared with three patients who received
placebo (all grade 3). GI bleeding (grade 1) was experienced by
three patients in the statin group, in addition to two (grade 2) and
one (grade 3) events. GI bleeding (grade 1) was experienced by two
patients in the placebo group in addition to two (grade 2) events.

 DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, LUNGSTAR, by far, is the largest randomized
trial of statin therapy in patients with cancer reported to date. Use
of placebo avoids an important bias present in observational
studies. Although pravastatin was safe, with high adherence—
patients tended to continue until disease progression—it did not
improve outcomes in patients with SCLC, nor in those with limited
stage or extensive stage disease.
When LUNGSTAR was developed in 2005, preclinical evi-
dence was sufficient, though not considered overwhelming by
some; however, rather than perform further experimental and/or
preclinical studies, followed by phase II, then phase III trials, the
investigators and funder (Cancer Research UK) decided to launch
a definitive large study sooner rather than later, given the growing
evidence in this field at the time. The independent data monitoring
committee reviewed efficacy during the trial. In April 2010, when
25% of the target number of deaths was observed, conditional
power (CP) for OS was 66%—CP is the chance of obtaining the
target HR of 0.82 if the trial continued to the end, given the data
thus far. In February 2011, with 655 patients recruited and 41% of
events, CP was 11% for OS, but 30% for PFS, which was not
considered low enough to stop the study early, even though it was
a secondary end point. Additional important reasons for finishing
accrual were to have a large study size with convincing results,
whether positive or negative, particularly given the accumulating
positive observational studies, and to ensure sufficient patient
numbers for limited disease and extensive disease in case prava-
statin was effective for one and not the other.
Various possibilities might explain our findings, including
dose, type of statin, or that our mechanistic understanding was too
simplistic. When our study was established, the maximum prav-
astatin dose was 40 mg, which seemed to be effective in a ran-
domized cancer trial12; however, this dose might be too low and the
current 80 mg maximal dose could have achieved efficacy. Al-
ternatively, hydrophilic statins, such as pravastatin, may not be as
effective as lipophilic agents, such as simvastatin; some studies have
suggested clearer benefits for simvastatin in lung cancer,21 with
a lack of benefit for pravastatin in cancer prevention or cancer
death observed in a trial of patients with coronary heart disease.29
However, there is insufficient evidence to reliably conclude
whether any one type of statin is better than another, and biologic
plausibility for a difference is lacking.22 Of interest, more recent
evidence in glioma cells has suggested that statins may fail to
work in certain cancer cells because of a phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase–mediated pathway connected to LDL receptors.30,31 It is
unclear whether this might impact the responsiveness to statins of
other cancers. Another study limitation is that blood lipid levels
were not measured as part of routine biochemistry for managing
patients with SCLC, which would have unblinded the trial, and we
did not secure funds to measure cholesterol and other relevant
markers from stored samples; therefore, we are unable to correlate
these or other factors, such as HMG-CoA reductase levels, in
tumor biopsies with outcomes at present.
We compared patient outcomes in LUNGSTAR with others.
Our observed median OS (10.7 months) is similar to that observed
in another United Kingdom trial of SCLC (comparing thalidomide
with placebo, but little difference was found), which had a similar
mix (approximately one half) of limited stage and extensive stage
disease (median 10.5 months).32 However, survival for limited
stage patients (median 14.6 months LUNGSTAR, 12.1 months in
the thalidomide trial), is less than observed in a recent radiotherapy
trial (median OS, 25 to 30 months),33 probably because it enrolled
patients from several countries, where more radiotherapy has been
given than in the United Kingdom in previous years.
We conducted a systematic literature review to identify all
randomized trials that were specifically designed to evaluate lipid-
lowering therapies among patients with cancer using MEDLINE
(1966 to March 2016), and the keywords ‘lipid’, ‘cholesterol’, ‘statin’
(and specific names), and ‘tumor/tumor’, ‘cancer’, ‘carcinoma’,
‘adenocarcinoma’ and ‘random.’ There were only 10 trials12,34-42
(9 of statins), which are summarized in Table 3. LUNGSTAR is
three times larger than any other randomized trial, the next
largest having enrolled 283 patients. The 9-month OS im-
provement for pravastatin in the earlier trial by Kawata et al12
was probably the result of a lack of blinding and small study size
(n = 83). Of importance, there are now five published double-
blind studies of statins in patients with cancer, including ours
(SCLC, gastric, pancreas, colorectal, and precancerous mela-
noma lesions), of which one used pravastatin, one lovastatin,
and three simvastatin, and none showing statins of various types
to be effective.36-39
We also found a single-arm, phase II trial and a non-
randomized, unblinded trial in patients with lung cancer. One was
for previously untreated extensive-disease– SCLC (n = 61) in which
simvastatin plus irinotecan and etoposide produced a 1-year OS
rate of 39.3% (target 45%); median OS and PFS were 11.0 months
and 6.1 months, respectively, which was similar to current
treatments.43 The other trial included patients with stage III and IV
cancer with non-SCLC, whose tumors were KRAS-mutant and
epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type, reported better out-
comes for 12 patients treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor plus
either simvastatin or atorvastatin compared with 55 who received
tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone. In that study the PFS was
2.0 months versus 1.0 month (P = .025), and OS 14.0 months
versus 5.4 months (P = .13); however, it was not reported why
those patients received a statin, hence there could be important
confounders not allowed for.44
Most prior studies that have reported benefits for statins were
observational, with inherent design problems, including confounding
and bias.45 Time-related biases are particularly concerning.46 Im-
mortal time bias occurs when there is a length of time between the
start of follow-up and a subsequent start of statin therapy, which is
counted in the total follow-up time for a participant—but during
which the participant is actually unexposed—and, thus, it seems
that this participant has survived longer than a control (non-
statin user). Jeon et al47 show how this bias can spuriously create
an association by using studies of patients with liver cancer
in which the OS HR for statin use versus nonuse was 0.84
(P = .047) before and 0.98 (P = .82) after allowance for this
bias. Randomized controlled trials, such as LUNGSTAR, avoid
these issues.
Preclinical studies continue to report positive effects for statins
in lung cancer cell lines with regard to reduced proliferation,48,49
reduced migration,50 increased apoptosis,49 and reduced tumor

 growth.50 There are also several ongoing trials of statins in various
cancers (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02360618, NCT01980823,
NCT01038154, NCT02161822, NCT02483871, NCT02569645,
and NCT02029573). Given the findings from our trial and the
other published, double-blind, randomized controlled trials,
independent data monitoring committees of studies that are still
recruiting or in follow-up should examine interim analyses of
clinical end points and stop early if there is sufficient evidence for
futility, thus saving resources. Trials of statins in patients with
cancer, which require an unexposed control group, will become
more difficult to conduct because the usual age group of patients
with cancer (middle and old age) already take them, as seen in
LUNGSTAR, in which 22% of screened patients were ineligible
because they were recent or current statin users.
In summary, we found no value for pravastatin when com-
bined with standard platinum chemotherapy in patients with
SCLC. Ongoing and future trials of statins used for either cancer
prevention or treatment should monitor clinical efficacy, and for
planned studies of patients with cancer, investigators should ensure
preclinical evidence is sufficient enough to warrant large-scale
randomized studies.
