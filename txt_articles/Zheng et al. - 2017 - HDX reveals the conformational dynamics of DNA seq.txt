The vitamin D receptor/retinoid X receptor-α heterodimer (VDRRXRα) regulates bone
mineralization via transcriptional control of osteocalcin (BGLAP) gene and is the receptor for
1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3). However, supra-physiological levels of 1,25D3 activates
the calcium-regulating gene TRPV6 leading to hypercalcemia. An approach to attenuate this
adverse effect is to develop selective VDR modulators (VDRMs) that differentially activate
BGLAP but not TRPV6. Here we present structural insight for the action of a VDRM compared
with agonists by employing hydrogen/deuterium exchange. Agonist binding directs crosstalk
between co-receptors upon DNA binding, stabilizing the activation function 2 (AF2) surfaces
of both receptors driving steroid receptor co-activator-1 (SRC1) interaction. In contrast, AF2
of VDR within VDRM:BGLAP bound heterodimer is more vulnerable for large stabilization
upon SRC1 interaction compared with VDRM:TRPV6 bound heterodimer. These results reveal
that the combination of ligand structure and DNA sequence tailor the transcriptional activity
of VDR toward specific target genes.

alcium ion metabolism and homeostasis is co-operatively
governed by the intestine, kidney, and bone to ensure
physiological bone mineralization, an important process of
laying down calcium phosphate on bone matrix1. The vitamin D
receptor (VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) super-
family, orchestrates calcium homeostasis and bone mineralization
through transcriptional control of VDR target genes in various
tissues. VDR is activated by the full agonist secosteroid hormone
1,25D32, 3 (an active metabolite of vitamin D3) resulting in
increased expression of the osteoblast hormone osteocalcin (bone
gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein (BGLAP)), a
protein essential for bone formation4. As such, 1,25D3 is used to
treat osteoporosis, a metabolic disease that manifests clinically as
deceased bone mass density. Although 1,25D3 is essential for
normal osteoclast formation, hyperactivation of VDR by this
secosteroid hormone results in untoward effects including
hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria derived from increased calcium
absorptions in the intestine5. The association of 1,25D3 treatment
with hypercalcemia is in part related to VDR-mediated expres-
sion of the epithelial Ca2+ channel TRPV6 (transient receptor
potential vanilloid type 6). This channel mediates transepithelial
calcium transport, and it is a major VDR target gene activated by
1,25D3 action in intestine6, 7. Therefore, safer vitamin D ther-
apeutics for treatment of osteoporosis are in high demand that
drive bone mineralization but are devoid of hypercalcemia effects.
One approach has been the development of non-calcemic VDR
modulators known as VDRMs. These compounds are designed to
differentially activate VDR target genes. To help facilitate the
design and discovery of such compounds, an understanding of
the complexity of the structural and molecular mechanisms of
VDRM action should be considered. This includes knowledge of
the conformational changes within the VDRRXRα heterodimeric
receptor complex that are induced by ligand binding and inter-
action with co-regulatory proteins, as well as allosteric crosstalk
upon binding specific regions thought to regulate VDR target
genes.
VDR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that forms an
obligate heterodimer with retinoid X receptor α (RXRα)8–10. Like
other NRs, VDR and RXRα comprise four major functional
domains. The N-terminal domain (NTD) is structurally dis-
ordered and contains the activation function 1 (AF1) motif which
facilitates ligand-independent activation of the receptor. Adjacent
to the NTD is the two-zinc finger-containing DNA binding
domain (DBD) and a flexible hinge domain links the DBD to the
ligand-binding domain (LBD). The LBD consists of three β sheets
and 12 α helices, a canonical structure adopted by most NRs11.
Helices 3, 5, and 12 of the structured LBD serve as the ligand-
dependent activation function 2 (AF2) surface for complementary
binding of co-regulator proteins (e.g., the p160 family of steroid
receptor co-activators such as SRC1). Agonist binding in the
hydrophobic pocket of LBD facilitates AF2 to adopt a con-
formational rearrangement that facilitates high affinity docking of
co-regulatory proteins12 possessing conserved helical nuclear
receptor box (NR box) motifs (5′—LXXLL—3′) that dock into the
AF2 surface13. These co-regulatory proteins either contain
chromatin remodeling activity or are scaffolds to tether remo-
deling enzymes to the receptor complex. Agonists of the receptor
drive interaction with co-activator proteins with histone acetyl
transferase activity to relax chromatin, whereas antagonists drive
interaction with co-repressor proteins with histone deacetylase
activity to condense chromatin.
NRs modulate transcriptional output by binding to specific
DNA sequences (response elements) within the promoter and
distal regions of their target genes, and recruiting chromatin
remodeling enzymes to either facilitate binding or block binding
of RNA polymerase II. Upon ligand binding, VDRRXRα
translocates and associates with genomic DNA. The VDRRXRα
heterodimer binds with high affinity to short DNA sequence
motifs known as VDR binding sequences (VBSs), which are
typically hexameric direct repeats of 5′-AGGTCA-3′ separated by
three base-pair spacers, a motif referred to as DR314–16. Within
the receptor complex, the DBDs of both VDR and RXRα and the
VDR hinge form the major structural determinants involved in
VBS recognition8,
17. Previously it was shown that DNA
sequences induce unique conformations within NRs, suggesting
that DNA is not only a scaffold but is a regulatory ligand for
NRs9, 18, 19. One previous study had shown that VDRRXRα
binding to DNA exerts long-range alterations of the conforma-
tional dynamics of the AF2 region impacting receptor interaction
with co-receptors9. In that study, distinct VBS differentially
impacted the conformational dynamics of the receptor complex
where the DBD allosterically transmitted information to distal
regions of the receptor complex involved in transcriptional
activity20. Together, these observations suggest that DNA plays a
direct role in determining the specificity of target gene activation.
Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) coupled with mass
spectrometry has proven to be a robust biophysical method to
probe protein conformational dynamics in the context of ligand
and protein/protein interactions9, 21–25. Here we apply HDX to
dissect the activation mechanism of VDRRXRα heterodimer
DNA complex upon binding to the endogenous agonists 1,25D3,
two synthetic full agonists (Cmpd1 and Cmpd2), or a novel non-
calcemic VDR modulator (VDRM; Cmpd3), and to oligonu-
cleotides representative of specific VBSs correlating to important
endogenous target genes modulated by VDR. Furthermore, the
impact of ligand and VBS binding on the interaction with the NR
co-activator SRC1 was profiled. Combined, the results presented
reveal that ligand structure and VBS sequence coordinate allos-
teric intra-molecular and inter- molecular communication within
the VDRRXRα heterodimer to modulate AF2 dynamics impact-
ing transcriptional activity in a DNA sequence specific, and
perhaps promoter specific fashion.
Results
Structure of VDRMs and their BGLAP and TRPV6 activation.
Compounds were tested for their hypercalcemia liabilities in
BGLAP and TRPV6 qPCR gene activation assays. The chemical
structures of the ligands used in these studies are presented in
Table 1 and these include the endogenous full agonist 1,25D3,
two synthetic full agonists (Cmpd1 and Cmpd2), and one VDRM
(Cmpd3), defined as a compound that displays a unique activa-
tion profile as compared with agonists. Unlike 1,25D3, Cmpds 1,
2, and 3 are non-secosteroidal tool molecules that are highly
optimized toward understanding functional selectivity of bone vs.
calcium effects in cells. The natural agonist 1,25D3 exhibited
potent hypercalcemia effects and enhanced activation profiles in
both BGLAP (EC50 = 4.10 nM, 100% Max. Stim.) and TRPV6
(EC50 = 9.81 nM, 100% Max. Stim.) qPCR based assays. The
maximum fold change over DMSO for cells treated with 1,25D3
was set to 100% maximum stimulation for both BGLAP and
TRPV6, fold change for other compounds were normalized to the
maximum stimulation value for 1,25D3 for each gene respec-
tively. EC50 values are the average from the replicate runs.
Cmpd1 was the most potent in the BGLAP activation assay (EC50
= 1.44 nM, 94.2% Max. Stim.) and was also able to effectively
activate TRPV6 gene expression with an EC50 of 63 nM (80.3%
Max. Stim.). Cmpd2 also displayed effective activation profiles in
both BGLAP (EC50 = 34.92 nM, 73% Max. Stim.) and TRPV6
(EC50 = 395 nM, 98.2% Max. Stim.) assays. In contrast, Cmpd3
exhibited dissociated activation profiles with an EC50 of > 10 µM
(17.4% Max. Stim.) and 698 nM (75.9% Max. Stim.) in TRPV6

 and BGLAP gene activation assays, respectively. Based on these
data, Cmpd3 presented a VDRM selective activation profile of
BGLAP over TRPV6 with significantly lower hypercalcemia lia-
bility (75.9 vs 17.4% Max. Stim.).
Structural features of VDR LBD-VDRM interaction. Here we
present the co-crystal structure of the VDR LBD-VDRM complex
at a 2.2 Å resolution (Table 2). To date, there are less than
10 structures in the PDB of non-secosteroids co-crystallized with
either rat or human VDR. The VDR LBD displays the canonical
α-helical sandwich similar to that observed in most NRs, and in
this structure Cmpd3 assumes a curve shaped conformation
accommodating the hydrophobic ligand binding pocket (LBP)
(Fig. 1a). The 5-amino tetrazole amide moiety of Cmpd3 occupies
the 1,25D3 A-ring region of the VDR LBP, hydrogen bonding
directly with Ser237 (H3) and through water to Tyr143 (H1) and
Ser278 (Loop5) (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2a). The sec-
ondary alcohol of Cmpd3 adopts the same bifurcated positioning
between His305 (Loop 6) and His397 (H11) as 1,25D3 albeit with
a slightly reduced hydrogen bonding distance between both
residues and the oxygen atom (2.71 Å vs. 2.81 Å), as shown in
Fig. 1c. This interaction likely assists H12 forming an agonist
position with its Val418 in proximity with tert-butyl group of
Cmpd3. Consistent with the crystal structure data, peptides that
contain these residues all displayed strong protection to solvent
exchange in the corresponding HDX studies (Supplementary
Fig. 2b). To compare the binding modes of Cmpd1 and Cmpd2
with Cmpd3, docking studies were performed with the VDR LBD
crystal structure using ICM Pro software (Molsoft). All com-
pounds (Cmpd1–3 and 1,25D3) occupy a similar overall orien-
tation and binding location in within the LBD. This is shown in
Fig. 1d which depicts a superimposition of Cmpd1–3 and 1,25D3
and their binding poses within the LBD.
Differential HDX of liganded VDRRXRα heterodimer. Greater
than 85 and 90% sequence coverage was obtained for full-length
VDR and RXRα, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1a, c and e).
The HDX data from all overlapping peptides were consolidated to

acid
values
using

approach26. HDX Workbench was used to map the HDX data to
the pymol structure model displayed in Supplementary Fig. 2c.
Differential HDX was performed to investigate conformational
perturbations within the intact VDRRXRα heterodimer induced
upon binding to natural agonist, synthetic agonists and a non-
calcemic VDRM. Regions within the receptor complex that
exhibit a decrease in solvent exchange as compared to apo-
complex are inferred to have been stabilized by the binding event.
Likewise, regions within the receptor complex that exhibit
increased exchange as compared with apo-complex are inferred
to have been destabilized by the binding event. Binding of intact
heterodimer to different ligands stabilized regions of the receptor
corresponding to the consensus ligand binding sites of VDR and
dimer interface within RXRα (RXRα: aa347–353 and aa419–430)
(Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 1b, d, column (i), (ii), (iii), and
(iv)). VDR residue regions—aa134–150 (H1), aa225–233 (H3),
aa273−279 (H5), aa310−316 (H7), aa390−403 (H11) and aa411
−419 (H12)—exhibited significantly reduced HDX kinetics upon
binding to natural ligand 1,25D3 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary
Fig. 1b, d, column (i)). Consistent with the structure of 1,25D3
bound VDR LBD (PDB: 1DB1), residues within these α-helixes—
Tyr143 (H1), Ser237 (H3), Arg274 (H5), Ser278 (H5), Trp286
(S1) and His305 (loop between H6 and H7)−form a hydrophobic
ligand-binding pocket (LBP) within the VDR LBD fold for
accommodation of 1,25D310, 12, 15. H11 and H12 (His397, Val418
and Phe422) whose positions are critical to AF2 activation adopt
an agonist position and make contacts with the methyl group of
1,25D3 via van der Waals’s force in the reported X-ray crystal
structure12. The ligand-dependency of H12 position is known to
be critical for forming a co-activator binding surface that allows
recruitment of co-activator proteins27. Binding of Cmpd3 to
heterodimer resulted in lower threshold of protection against
deuterium exchange at residue regions—aa234−244 (H3), aa309
−316 (H7), and aa390−403 (H11) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary
Fig. 1b, d (column iv)). Despite being a weaker binder, interaction
with this non-calcemic ligand afforded a similar extent of pro-
tection at VDR H12 compared to that of 1,25D3. Furthermore,
binding of synthetic agonist Cmpd1 or Cmpd2 presented even
higher magnitude of protection against solvent exchange at
aforementioned regions compared to 1,25D3, suggesting that
synthetic agonists associate with stronger hydrogen bonding
networks within VDR LBP (Fig. 2b, c and Supplementary Fig. 1b,
d column (ii) and column (iii)). Furthermore, binding of Cmpd3
resulted in protection to solvent exchange in the VDR hinge
domain/C-terminal Extension (CTE) (aa93−99 and aa99−108)
and RXRα residues 271−293 (H3), and 439–450 (H11) that were
not present for natural or synthetic agonists, suggesting a distinct
ligand binding property for this selective modulator (Fig. 2d and
Supplementary Fig. 1b, d column (iv)). Remote from VDR LBP,
the hinge domain could be possibly stabilized either through
direct binding with ligand itself or allosteric intra-molecular

 interactions with VDR LBD. Interestingly, DNA binding could
also disrupt the hydrogen bonding activities of VDR hinge
domain9, 28. It is hence possible that ligand binding could influ-
ence DNA binding activity by directly impacting the conforma-
tion of DNA-interacting hinge domain. Furthermore, binding of
all VDR ligands led to allosteric destabilization or increased sol-
vent exchange at residues aa82−89 derived from VDR DBD,
indicating that ligand binding could induce allosteric intra-
molecular crosstalk and potentially modulate DBD function
(Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 1b, d column (i), (ii), (iii), and
(iv)).
LBD and hinge are functionally integrated with the DBD. Next,
we introduced oligonucleotides representative of two hypothetical
yet distinct VBSs to investigate how DNA binding events affect
conformational dynamics of VDRRXRα heterodimer when it is
bound with the natural agonist 1,25D3. One synthetic oligo
(DR3)
represents
an
idealized
direct
repeat
DR3
VBS
(5′-CGTAGGTCAATCAGGTCACGTCGT-3′) containing two
consensus half-sites 5′-AGGTCA-3′ separated by three base
pairs, whereas the other oligo (DR3 half-site) contains only one
consensus
half-site
(5′-CTAGCTCCCGAGGTCAGCGACGG
CGCAGG-3′). Interaction of the VDRRXRα heterodimer with
either of the two hypothetical VBSs resulted in protection to
solvent exchange in DBD regions of both receptor and co-
receptor (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1b, d column (v) and
(vi)). Specifically, VDR residues aa17−25 containing zinc-
coordinating residue Cys24 exhibited a twofold protection with
DR3 half-site compared to DR3 VBS, suggesting perhaps that
interaction with DR3 half-site VBS requires an alternative con-
formation conferred at the zinc finger (Supplementary Fig. 1b
column (v) and column (vi)). Interestingly, VDR hinge/CTE
domain afforded a higher magnitude of protection to solvent
exchange upon binding of DR3 when compared to binding to
DR3 half-site VBS (Supplementary Fig. 1b column (v) and col-
umn (vi)). VDR hinge/CTE domain, which contains positively
charged residues Arg102, Lys103, and Arg103, might form
stronger electrostatic interactions with negatively charged phos-
phate backbone of the DR3 oligo compared with that of DR3 half-
site oligo. CTE-DNA interactions have also been observed in
PPARγRXRα and Rev-Erb structures with their CTEs inserted
into the minor groove of DNA27, 29. Unlike VDR, RXRα DBD
(aa137−158 and aa169−178) presented analogous HDX profiles
upon binding to DR3 half-site and DR3 VBSs (Supplementary

 Fig. 1d column (v) and column (vi)). Such stabilization of the
heterodimer could be either derived from protein-DNA interac-
tion or heterodimerization between the co-receptor’s DBDs27.
The most striking differences in HDX kinetics upon binding
the different VBSs was within the VDR LBD. The binding of DR3
half-site VBS resulted in substantial protection to solvent
exchange in regions constituting the AF2 surface (aa300−308
(H5), aa391−403 (H11), and aa411−419 (H12)), as well as other
regions within the VDR LBD; e.g., aa136−150 (H1), aa206−218
(loop) and aa245−259 (H4) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 1b, d
column (vi)). Specifically, VDR residues aa109−133 residing on
the C-terminus of hinge/CTE and N-terminus of helix 1 (H1)
underwent partial cooperative unfolding event (EX1 kinetics as
revealed by detection of two distinct deuterated ion distributions
for the same peptide30) upon heterodimer binding to DR3 half-
site VBS (Supplementary Fig. 2d). For EX1 kinetics the refolding
rate of the corresponding protein region is slower than the solvent
exchange rate of amide hydrogens in the unfolded region, thus
these amide hydrogens exchange simultaneously. This situation
gives rise to a distinct MS signature, specifically bimodal mass
distributions, with the lower mass envelop corresponding to
molecules that have not yet exchanged (not yet unfolded) and the
higher mass envelop corresponding to molecules that have
undergone solvent exchange (molecules that have unfolded).
Under native state conditions, proteins exhibit EX2 kinetics
wherein only a single MS envelop is observed over time (the
refolding rate is faster than the rate of solvent exchange).
However, the occurrence of EX1 cooperative unfolding behavior
in native state proteins have been shown to provide important
clues to intermediate conformational states of proteins22, 31–33.
The occurrence of EX1 behavior indicates that the hinge/H1
region of VDR is structurally heterogeneous in solution when
1,25D3-heterodimer is bound to DR3 half-site VBS, perhaps a
mixture of molecules in either an open or closed conformation.
These two distinct conformations might differentially orient the
LBD with respect to the DBD. Unlike that observed upon binding
DR3 half-site VBS, little conformational change was observed in
VDR LBD when bound to DR3 (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary
Fig. 1b, d column (v) and (vi)), and the hinge/H1 region of VDR
adopted a homogeneous conformation as only EX2 kinetics were
observed (Supplementary Fig. 2d). In the previously reported
cryo-EM structure of VDRRXRα bound to DR3 VBS, Pro122,
which resides on the VDR hinge, was described as the “kink
residue” between the C-terminal hinge helix and helix H1 of the
LBD playing an important role in dictating the orientation of the
LBD, resulting in an open LBD dimer architecture facing away
from DBD8. It is thus reasonable to propose that the DBD/hinge
domains of VDR confer target VBS sequence specificity and
selectively transmit allosteric signals to alter the dynamics of the
LBD. In contrast, the LBD of RXRα afforded similar HDX
kinetics upon binding to either of the two VBSs (Fig. 3a, b and
Supplementary Fig. 1d column (v) and (vi)). The RXRα dimer
interface, aa420−430 (H10), showed reduced HDX, suggesting
that
ligand
and
DNA
binding
sequentially
stabilize
the
VDRRXRα heterodimer, and that VDR heterodimerization with
RXRα
likely
enhances
binding
affinity
for
DNA8,
9,
34.
Importantly, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2e, the ligand-free
heterodimer binds to these two different VBSs with similar
affinity as determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA). This observation further supports that the
sequence of the VBS, and not its affinity for heterodimer,
correlates with alterations of AF2 dynamics within VDR that
impact intra-molecular signaling and target gene transactivation.
To further investigate whether compounds with distinct
chemical structures induce unique conformations within the
heterodimer upon DNA binding, parallel HDX experiments were
conducted in the presence of synthetic agonists to probe
conformational dynamics of VDRRXRα heterodimer with and
without DR3 and DR3 half-site VBSs, respectively. The synthetic
agonists, Cmpd1 and Cmpd2, induced a greater magnitude of
protection to solvent exchange across the DBD and hinge domain
of VDR upon binding to DR3 VBS resulting in larger ΔΔHDX

 between the two VBS binding datasets (ΔΔHDX = ΔHDXheter-
odimer:agonist ± DR3—ΔHDXheterodimer:agonist ± DR3 half-site). For instance,
Cmpd1 and Cmpd2 induced a 21 and 19% ΔΔHDX (p < 0.001)
in the VDR hinge region (aa97−108) whereas only 4% ΔΔHDX
was
observed
when
bound
with
1,25D3
(Fig.
3c–f
and
Supplementary Fig. 1b, column (vii), (viii), (ix), and (x)).
However, the most striking difference was observed within a
region of the VDR LBD that possessed insensitive to the VBS
sequence (Fig. 3c–f). In this region, binding of synthetic agonists
and DNA resulted in protection to solvent exchange in LBD
regions spanning H1, loop, H3, H5, H9, H11, and H12 (Fig. 3c–f
and Supplementary Fig. 1b column (vii), (viii), (ix), and (x)). This
was a dramatic contrast to that observed for 1,25D3-bound
heterodimer upon binding DR3 and DR3 half-site VBSs, which
each induced unique HDX signatures within the VDR LBD. In
addition, the VDR hinge/H1 peptide (aa109−133) underwent
partial unfolding (as revealed by observing EX1 kinetics) when
heterodimer
was
bound
to
synthetic
agonists
and
DNA
(Supplementary Fig. 2d). It is possible that the presence of
synthetic agonists and DNA drive structural rearrangement in
VDR hinge/H1 to affect hydrogen bonding networks within the
LBD. Such a scenario may suggest that transduction of signal
from the receptors’ DBD to its LBD could be regulated not only
by specific VBS sequence but also by the specific ligand in the
LBP. Therefore, at least for VDR, the DBD appears to be
functionally integrated with LBD in response to the specific
sequence of a VBS within a target gene promoter, as well as the
exact chemical structure of the ligand.
Interaction with synthetic agonists and VBSs drove unique
HDX perturbation patterns in regions involved in RXRα hinge
domain as well as its AF2 surface. On the RXRα side of the
heterodimer, reduced solvent exchange was observed within the
DBD (aa137−158, aa169−178), the dimer interface (aa419−430),
hinge-H1 (aa220−237) region, and the loop region between H8
and H9 domain (aa376−390), which is oriented within the AF2
region (Fig. 3c–f and Supplementary Fig. 1d column (vii), (viii),
(ix), and (x)). Previously it has been shown that the hinge domain
of NRs plays a critical role in maintaining the activity of NRs28.
The presence of Cmpd2 and DNA afforded additional protection
to solvent exchange in H12 AF2 helix (aa452−462) of RXRα
(Fig. 3e, f and Supplementary Fig. 1d column (ix) and (x)). To
further examine whether these distinct HDX signatures are
specific to heterodimer but not the RXRα co-receptor, we
performed HDX studies of RXRα alone in the presence and
absence of ligand and DNA. The binding of Cmpd1 to RXRα
alone preserved apo-like dynamics suggesting that there are no
detectable conformational changes of RXRα upon ligand binding
(Supplementary Fig. 1d column (xxvi)). Sequential interaction
with DR3 VBS resulted in protection to solvent exchange only in
RXRα DBD (Supplementary Fig. 1d column (xxvii)). The absence

 of VDR abrogated those unique HDX perturbations in RXRα.
Upon heterodimerization with VDR, the dynamic nature of
RXRα in the synthetic agonist bound state differs from that of
1,25D3 upon interacting with DNA. Therefore, these results
suggest that ligand and DNA could both coordinate both intra-
molecular and inter-molecular allosteric communications within
a NR heterodimer complex.
Agonists stabilize AF2 of both receptors upon SRC1 binding.
The AF2 region of NRs serves as the binding surface for
recruitment of transcriptional co-regulatory proteins that contain
an α-helical nuclear receptor binding motif referred to as an NR
box9, 35. To test the hypothesis that the alterations in the stability
of the heterodimer driven by ligand and DNA binding could
modulate co-activator interaction, we sequentially probed the
conformational ensembles of heterodimer complex in the pre-
sence and absence of the receptor interaction domain (RID) of
the p160 NR co-activator steroid receptor co-activator 1 (SRC1
RID). The RID of SRC1 contains three LXXLL NR box motifs. In
the presence of 1,25D3, interaction with SRC1 RID resulted in ~
21 and ~ 16% reduction in solvent exchange (p < 0.001) within
H12 (aa411−419) of VDR when the 1,25D3-bound heterodimer
was in the presence of DR3 and DR3 half-site VBSs, respectively
(Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1b column (xi) and (xii)). In
contrast to that observed on the VDR side of the 1,25D3-bound
heterodimer, the RXRα AF2 surface was insensitive to the pre-
sence of the SRC1 RID, further suggesting ligand dependency for
SRC1 recruitment to the heterodimer is associated with exclu-
sively the VDR AF2 surface, and upon binding forms a compact
protein complex when bound to either DR3 and DR3 half-site
VBSs. These HDX data are consistent with observations made
using SAXS36. In this study, it was concluded that the NR het-
erodimers binds only one molecule of SRC1 RID and does so
through the RXRα partner36. Binding of SRC1 RID to either
Cmpd1-heterodimer-DR3 or Cmpd1-heterodimer-DR3 half-site
complex resulted in nearly indistinguishable HDX patterns within
H12 (aa412−419) of VDR with ~ 11% decrease in solvent
exchange (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1b, column (xiii) and
(xiv)). Similar effects on HDX kinetics were observed for both
Cmpd2-heterodimer-VBS complexes where interaction
with
SRC1 RID resulted in decreased exchange of ~ 20% for H12, ~ 9%
for H3, and ~ 6% for H1 (Fig. 4e, f and Supplementary Fig. 1b,
column (xv) and (xvi)). In contrast to that observed with 1,25D3,
in addition to stabilization of VDR AF2, binding of SRC1 RID
stabilized regions of RXRα AF2 (aa211−279 (H3), aa438−449
(H11−12), and aa439−450 (H11−12) (Fig. 4c–f and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1d column (xiii), (xiv), (xv), and (xvi)). Previously, it has
been shown that residues Phe277 (H3), Phe437 (H11), and
Phe450 (H12) are important for formation of a stable AF2 surface
facilitating co-activator binding to RXRα15. In the absence of
VDR, RXRα alone was not capable of binding to SRC1 RID
(Supplementary Fig. 1d column (xxviii)). Combined, these data
suggest
that
synthetic
agonist
and
DNA
binding
to
the
VDRRXRα heterodimer results in distinct VDR and RXRα
orientations, which facilitate co-activator interaction and that
synthetic agonists, but not 1,25D3, modulate inter-allosteric
communications within VDRRXRα heterodimer to fine tune
transcriptional activity.
Cmpd3 vs. 1,25D3 liganded VDRRXRα on BGLAP and
TRPV6 VBSs. HDX was employed to probe the structural
dynamics
and
activation
mechanism
of
1,25D3
and
the
non-calcemic modulator Cmpd3 liganded heterodimer bound to
oligonucleotides representative of VBSs linked to the VDR target
genes BGLAP and TRPV6. The sequences of the oligonucleotides
used were derived from VBSs reported in BGLAP and TRPV6,
each containing two direct repeats separated by a three base-pair
gap, a motif of a family of closely related VBSs36, 37. For BGLAP
two distinct oligos were used. The first was representative of a VBS
located at 457 b upstream from the transcription start site
of BGLAP from rattus (5′-CTAGGTGAATGAGGACAT-3′),
a VBS used in the previously reported SAXS study. A second oligo
was representative of a VBS located at 510 b upstream of start
site
of
human
BGLAP
gene
(5′-GGTGACTCACCGGG
TGAACGGGGGCA-3′)38. For TRPV6, an oligo representative
of a VBS located 4.3 kb upstream from the transcription start
site of human TRPV6 gene (5′-CAAGGGGTAGTGAGGTCA
AAAGCA-3′) was used. Binding of 1,25D3 liganded heterodimer
to TRPV6 VBS resulted in higher protection to solvent exchange
in both the DBD and hinge domains of VDR as compared to that
observed upon interaction with the BGLAP VBS, indicating that
the TRPV6 VBS makes more interactions with these domains than
does the BGLAP VBS (Fig. 5a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1b,
column (xvii) and (xviii)). VDR LBD exhibited only subtle per-
turbations in HDX behavior upon binding to the BGLAP VBS
(Fig. 5a, i and Supplementary Fig. 1b, column (xvii)). This
observation is consistent with previous SAXS results that suggest
the heterodimer complex forms an elongated conformation when
bound to BGLAP VBS36. We then analyzed the protein complex
bound to the human BGLAP VBS and obtained similar results to
that with the rat VBS (Supplementary Fig. 1b, column (xvii*)).
Similarly, binding of 1,25D3 liganded heterodimer to TRPV6 VBS
displayed minor alterations in the dynamics of the VDR LBD
(Fig. 5b, i and Supplementary Fig. 1b column (xviii)). Addition-
ally, RXRα exhibited reduced deuterium exchange only in its DBD
and dimer interface upon binding to BGLAP and TRPV6 VBSs
(Fig. 5a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1b, column (xvii) and (xviii)).
Combined, these results further support that in the presence of the
natural ligand 1,25D3, the heterodimer forms an open con-
formation upon binding to either BGLAP or TRPV6 VBSs
regardless of their specific nucleotide sequence.
HDX analysis of ligand binding of VDRM Cmpd3 already
revealed that it processes lower potency to perturb VDR LBP
dynamics compared to that of 1,25D3 (Fig. 2d and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1b column (iv)). The presence of Cmpd3 and TRPV6
VBS resulted in further stabilization of the DBD and hinge
domains of VDR as compared to the presence of the BGLAP VBS,
as shown by higher extent of protection to solvent exchange
within these regions (Fig. 5c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1b
column (xix) and (xx)). Unlike the effects of 1,25D3, the binding
of BGLAP and TRPV6 VBSs to the VDRM-bound heterodimer
induced different degrees of protection to solvent exchange
within the VDR LBD (Fig. 5c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1b
column (xix) and (xx)). Nearly identical HDX profiles were
observed for the protein-ligand complex bound to either the rat
BGLAP VBS or the human BGLAP VBS (Supplementary Fig. 1b,
column (xix*)). A further comparison of the HDX data revealed
that a larger surface area of VDR LBD demonstrated increased
protection to solvent exchange in the presence of the TRPV6 VBS
when compared with the presence of the BGLAP VBS (Fig. 5c, d
and
Supplementary
Fig.
1b
column
(xix)
and
(xx)).
Furthermore, binding of TRPV6 VBS to the heterodimer altered
the dynamics of the VDR AF2 H12 (further reduction in
deuterium exchange by ~ 13%) that was not observed upon
binding the BGLAP VBS (Fig. 5c, d, and j and Supplementary
Fig. 1b column (xix) and (xx)). Additionally, RXRα exhibited very
similar protection to exchange in its DBD and dimer interface
upon binding to either BGLAP or TRPV6 VBSs (Fig. 5c, d and
Supplementary Fig. 1d column (xix) and (xx)). Also, no
statistically
significant
inter-molecular
communication
was
observed between the co-receptors. These data demonstrate that

 Cmpd3, a non-calcemic modulator, perturbs the dynamics
of the heterodimer in an alternative mechanism from the
natural ligand 1,25D3 in the presence of the BGLAP and TRPV6
VBSs.
To test whether these observed differences in structural
dynamics could influence receptors binding to SRC1, we
performed sequential HDX studies to probe the heterodimer in
the presence of RID of the co-activator. Addition of the SRC1
RID to the 1,25D3-heterodimer-BGLAP complex resulted in
increased stabilization of the VDR AF2 surface, with minimal
differences
as
compared
to
that
observed
for
the
SRC1
RID:1,25D3-heterodimer-TRPV6 complex. HDX analysis of both
complexes detects similar decrease in solvent exchange within
H12 residues aa411-419 of VDR (Fig. 5e, f, and i and
Supplementary Fig. 1b column (xxi) and (xxii)). These data
suggest that the open H12 conformation of the 1,25D3-
heterodimer DNA complex results in similar SRC1 interaction.
In contrast, HDX analysis of complexes of Cmpd3-heterodimer-
BGLAP VBS and Cmpd3-heterodimer-TRPV6 VBS revealed
differential
interaction
of
the
SRC1
RID
with
the
VDR
AF2 surface. There was nearly a twofold higher magnitude of
protection to solvent exchange in the former complex (~ 20%)
when compared to the latter (~ 9%) (Fig. 5g, h, and j and
Supplementary Fig. 1b column (xxiii) and (xxiv)). This difference
in stabilization of VDR AF2 would suggest a difference in affinity
for SRC1 binding further indicating that the VDR AF2 surface
within the Cmpd3-heterodimer-BGLAP VBS complex facilitates
SRC1 binding more than when the receptor is bound to TRPV6
VBS. The apparent coordinated actions of Cmpd3 and TRPV6
VBS may selectively induce conformational changes in AF2 that
influence the receptors’ ability to recruit transcriptional machin-
ery. These comparative HDX studies of the VDRRXRα hetero-
dimer in the presence of two functionally distinct ligands, 1,25D3
and the non-calcemic Cmp3, provide structural insights into how
these compounds might be differentially controlling VDR target
gene expression and suggest that the non-calcemic ligand Cmpd3

 perturbs heterodimer dynamics in an alternative mechanism
from 1,25D3 at BGLAP and TRPV6 VBSs.
Discussion
VDR controls expression of a gene program regulating calcium
hemostasis. Despite its beneficial effects for treatment of osteo-
porosis, usage of the VDR agonist 1,25D3 is limited by dose-
dependent hypercalcemia2, 39, 40. To improve the therapeutic
index of VDR ligands, efforts have focused on the development of
1,25D3 analogs and synthetic non-secosteroid ligands that exhibit
a lower threshold for hypercalcemia. Such dissociated VDR
ligands, called VDRMs, are positive on BGLAP expression and
neutral on TRPV6 expression. Understanding the structural
mechanism that affords this dissociated profile would greatly
facilitate drug development. To address this, we performed a
detailed comparative biophysical study with 1,25D3, two agonists
Cmpds1−2, and a non-calcemic VDRM Cmpd3. These molecules
have distinct chemical structures and are distinguished based on
their hypercalcemia liability profile in a TRPV6 gene activation
assay. To understand the conformational dynamics induced by
these ligands upon binding VDR, differential HDX studies were
performed on the VDRRXRα heterodimer in the presence and

 absence of these ligands, VBSs including DR3, DR3 half-site,
BGLAP and TRPV6, and the RID of the co-activator protein
SRC1. These studies provide snapshots of distinct conformational
ensembles of VDRRXRα heterodimer in solution and allow
multiple comparisons of sequential binding events (e.g., ligand,
DNA, and co-activator protein) to probe alterations in the
dynamics of the heterodimer to drive molecular interactions with
co-regulators. While these HDX data do not provide specific
orientations of each structural element within the heterodimer
complex, they yield unique insight into local and global con-
formational fluctuations within the protein complex that could
not be inferred from static structures.
Differential HDX analysis reveals unique intra-molecular and
inter- molecular communications between heterodimer LBDs and
DBDs in response to various VDR ligands and DNA VBSs. For
instance, ligand binding to the LBD modulates dynamics of the
remote zinc fingers within the DBD and DNA binding in turn
enables
allosteric
perturbations
impacting
LBD
dynamics.
Although it is not known how the receptor hinge domain
interacts with the DBD and LBD, the HDX results support a
structural model where the hinge plays a critical role in deter-
mining the structural arrangement of co-receptor’s LBDs to
DBDs. Various combinations of ligands and DNA VBSs stabilize
the hinge of VDR to different extents, suggesting that it adopts
unique conformations depending on the ligand and the specific
sequence of the VBS. In the presence of 1,25D3, binding of DR3
half-site but not DR3 VBS alters receptor dynamics in the remote
LBD. This contrasts with what is observed with synthetic agonist
action wherein the binding of either DR3 or DR3 half-site VBSs
drive analogous perturbations in LBD of VDR. Interestingly, a
region spanning the hinge and H1 of the VDR LBD undergoes
partial cooperative unfolding (EX1 kinetics) correlating with
allosteric stabilizations observed in LBD suggesting the VDR
hinge and H1 regions possess inherent flexibility enabling signals
to be transmitted from the DBD to the LBD.
Interestingly, the presence of synthetic agonist and DNA drive
long-range stabilization of hinge-H1 and H8−H9 loop region
(part of the RXRα AF2 surface) in RXRα. Despite exhibiting

Fig. 6 Schematic representation of VDRRXRα heterodimer activation by different ligand and DNA. Protein stabilization induced by interactions of the
ligand, DNA and SRC1 RID (as measured by the differential HDX profiles) is shown in blue and green color, whereas destabilization is shown in yellow
color. Regions with no significant change are colored gray. VDRRXRα heterodimer is shown with co-receptors’ LBDs including AF2, hinge domains, and
DBDs. Allosteric intra-molecular and inter-molecular communications within co-receptors are indicated by black dotted arrow. a Synthetic agonists;
Cmpd’s 1 and 2, induce greater stabilization in VDR LBD compared to that of a natural ligand 1,25D3. VDRM Cmpd3 exhibits relatively weak stabilization
within AF2. Binding of all ligands induce allosteric destabilization within the VDR DBD. Additional stabilization was observed within the VDR hinge and H3
of RXRα upon binding to Cmpd3. The heterodimer interface becomes more stable upon ligand binding. b Binding of 1,25D3-bound heterodimer to DR3 and
DR3 half-site result in stabilization within the DBDs and VDR hinge. Interaction with DR3 half-site leads to intra-domain allosteric stabilization in VDR LBD
and AF2 that are not observed upon DR3 binding. In contrast, the presence of synthetic agonist and DNA with heterodimer drive stabilization in the DBD
and hinge of both co-receptors and VDR AF2. c Large stabilization was observed in VDR AF2 upon binding SRC1 RID, whereas stabilization in RXRα AF2
was only observed when heterodimer is bound to synthetic agonist and DNA. d Cmpd3 could modulate heterodimer dynamics in an alternative
mechanism, in which allosteric stabilization in VDR AF2 occurs upon heterodimer binding to TRPV6 rather than BGLAP. In contrast, neither BGLAP nor
TRPV6 alter the conformational of VDR LBD when VDRRXR heterodimer is bound with 1,25D3. e Binding of SRC1 RID results in less stabilization at VDR
AF2 when heterodimer is associated with Cmpd3 and TRPV6

 relatively modest stabilization, the altered flexibility in these
regions of RXRα may result in a unique orientation of the RXRα
LBD relative to its dimer partner. This in turn would sequentially
impact the positioning of co-activator upon interaction with the
heterodimer perhaps impacting co-activator to DNA distance. In
the context of the heterodimer, SRC1 RID binding drives stabi-
lization of the AF2 surface in both VDR and RXRα. In contrast,
binding of ligand and DNA to RXRα homodimer abrogates the
perturbation dynamics of the RXRα LBD. This observation would
suggest a potential role for VDR in mediating inter-receptor
crosstalk within the heterodimer. Inter-molecular interactions
would provide a direct mechanism for transducing information
between the co-receptors VDR to RXRα.
As shown in Fig. 6, the results presented here suggest two
distinct activation modes mediated by non-secosteroid synthetic
agonists and a VDRM (Cmpd3) as compared to that observed
with the natural ligand 1,25D3. The binding of VDRM to het-
erodimer leads to an unique stabilization of the VDR hinge that is
not detected upon binding natural ligand or synthetic agonists,
suggesting that ligand itself could have a direct effect on DNA
binding. VDRM binding afforded less protection to solvent
exchange within the LBP of VDR as compared to that observed
upon binding 1,25D3. These differences in LBP dynamics that are
initiated by ligand-binding properties likely give rise to the dif-
ferences in DNA recognition properties and potency for SRC1
interaction observed for Cmpd3 when compared to 1,25D3.
Binding of either BGLAP or TRPV6 VBS to 1,25D3-bound het-
erodimer fails to perturb the dynamics of the LBDs and results in
an open AF2 conformation susceptible for co-activator binding.
Whereas binding of TRPV6 but not BGLAP VBS to Cmpd3
liganded heterodimer specifically alters the stability of AF2 in
VDR blunting the receptor’s ability to interact with SRC1. It is
important to note that the BGLAP and TRPV6 VBSs used in
these studies are putative VDR response elements (VDREs) yet to
be validated as bona fide VDREs in vivo. Taken together, these
results suggest that the conformational flexibility of VDRRXRα
heterodimer allows the core complex to adopt different con-
formations depending on the ligand bound, specific sequence of
the VBS and co-regulatory protein binding, providing a common
mechanism for ligand-dependency of NR activation on various
target genes. The model presented may provide a framework for
the design of improved VDMRs for the treatment of osteoporosis.
Methods
Reagents. Full-length WT His-hVDR (Δ (151–190)) and WT Flag-h RXRα were
expressed in a baculovirus system and purified by Ni-NTASEC or Flag-SEC,
respectively. His-hSRC1 RID (627–786) variant 1 (NM_003743) was expressed in
Escherichia coli (BL21 DE3) and purified using His-Trap (GE Healthcare). The
final protein buffer was 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 2
mM DTT. The purity of each protein was > 95% and was verified using SDS-
PAGE, western blot and MALDI MS.

duplex oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies.
Deuterium oxide (99.9 atom % D) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Heterodimer complex was formed by mixing VDR and RXRα at 1:1 molar ratio
(final concentration around 10 μM), and complex formation was confirmed by gel-
shift assays. Vitamin D3 (Sigma) and synthetic Cmpds 1, 2, and 3 (provided by Eli
Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were added at a 10-fold molar excess to heterodimer.
SRC1 RID was added in a 2× molar ratio to heterodimer, and oligonucleotide
(VBS) was mixed with the protein complex as needed (1.5× molar ratio). NMR
data for the synthetic compounds are tabulated in the Supplemental Materials.
Crystallography. Human VDR LBD domain (119–425, Δ (166–216), S222L) with
N-terminal his tag and SMT fusion was expressed in E. coli. The SMT fusion (7
mg) was cleaved with ULP1 enzyme (100 μl, 1 mg/ml) for 8 h at 4 °C with dialysis
into buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 25 mM imi-
dazole, 0.2% BOG (b-octyl glucoside), 5 mM Bme (beta mercaptoethanol)).The
protein was purified by Ni-NTASEC and stored in final protein buffer 50 mM Tris
(pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 2 mM DTT. Crystals of the protein/
Cmpd 3 complex (PDB code: 5V39) were grown by vapor diffusion with a well
solution of 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 25% PEG 3350 and 200 mM Ammonium
Sulfate (reservoir buffer). Crystallization tray was set-up with 0.3 μl protein and 0.3
μl reservoir buffer (VDR LBD concentration was 3.1 mg/ml; ligand concentration
1 mM). The crystals had a space group of P212121 with cell dimensions of 44.00 Å,
52.67 Å and 105.88 Å. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beam line LRL-CAT
at Advanced Photon Source (APS). The structures were solved by molecular
replacement using a prior internal structure as a template. The structure of VDR
LBD with Cmpd3 was determined to a resolution of 2.2 Å. The crystallographic
refinement was done by Refmac 541 and Buster42 while the model building was
carried out by Coot43. The final refinement R-factors were Rwork = 0.167, Rfree =
0.235.
Molecular docking. All docking simulations were carried out in ICM Pro (Mol-
soft) using the Docking module. The crystal structure of the VDR LBD (5V39) with
waters and ligands removed was used as the receptor. The ICM Pro software
implements an algorithm of a biased probability Monte Carlo (BPMC) procedure
(PMID: 8289329). Cmpds 1−2 were docked and the lowest energy poses were used
for interpretation. Figures were generated in PyMol (Schrodinger).
HDX-MS. Solution-phase amide HDX experiments were carried out with a fully
automated system (CTC HTS PAL, LEAP Technologies, Carrboro, NC; housed
inside a 4 °C cabinet) as follows.
Peptide Identification: Peptides were identified using tandem MS (MS/MS)
experiments performed with either a LTQ Orbitrap XL with ETD or a Q Exactive
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) over a 70-min gradient. Product ion
spectra were acquired in a data-dependent mode and the five most abundant ions
were selected for the product ion analysis per scan event. The MS/MS *.raw data
files were converted to *.mgf files and then submitted to MASCOT (version 2.3
Matrix Science, London, UK) for peptide identification. The maximum number of
missed cleavages was set at 4 with the mass tolerance for precursor ions ± 0.6 Da
and for fragment ions ± 8 p.p.m. Oxidation to methionine was selected for variable
modification. Pepsin was used for digestion and no specific enzyme was selected in
the MASCOT during the search. Peptides included in the peptide set used for HDX
detection had a MASCOT score of 20 or greater. The MS/MS MASCOT search was
also performed against a decoy (reverse) sequence and false positives were ruled
out if they did not pass a 1% false discovery rate. The MS/MS spectra of all the
peptide ions from the MASCOT search were further manually inspected and only
the unique charged ions with the highest MASCOT score were included in HDX
peptide set.
HDX-MS analysis: 10 μM of the apo protein was mixed with 1:10 molar excess
of ligand and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C for complex formation before subjecting
them to HDX analysis. For the differential HDX experiments, 5 μl of either the apo
or the liganded protein complex with DNA and SRC1 RID were mixed with 20 μl
of D2O-containing HDX buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM
DTT) and incubated at 4 °C for 0 s, 10 s, 30 s, 60 s, 300 s, 900 s, or 3,600 s.
Following on-exchange, unwanted forward-exchange or back-exchange was
minimized and the protein was denatured by the addition of 25 μl of a quench
solution (1% v/v TFA in 3 M urea and 50 mM TCEP). Samples were then
immediately passed through an immobilized pepsin column (prepared in house) at
50 μl min-1 (0.1% v/v TFA, 15 °C) and the resulting peptides were trapped and
desalted on a 1.0 mm × 10 mm C8 trap column (Hypersil Gold, Thermo Fisher,
Grand Island, NY). The bound peptides were then gradient-eluted (5–50% CH3CN
v/v and 0.3% v/v formic acid) across a 1.0 mm × 50 mm C18 separation column
(Hypersil Gold, Thermo Fisher, Grand Island, NY) for 6 min. Sample handling and
peptide separation were conducted at 4 °C. The eluted peptides were then subjected
to electrospray ionization directly coupled to a high resolution Orbitrap mass
spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap XL with ETD, Q Exactive, or Exactive, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, San Jose, CA). Each HDX experiment was carried out in triplicate with a
single preparation of each protein-ligand complex. The intensity weighted mean m/
z centroid value of each peptide envelope was calculated and subsequently
converted into a percentage of deuterium incorporation. This is accomplished by
determining the observed averages of the undeuterated and fully deuterated spectra
using the conventional formula described elsewhere44. In the absence of a fully
deuterated control, 100% deuterium incorporation was calculated theoretically, and
corrections for back-exchange were made on the basis of an estimated 70%
deuterium recovery and accounting for 79.9% final deuterium concentration in the
sample (1:5 dilution in D2O HDX buffer). Statistical significance for the differential
HDX data is determined by an unpaired t-test for each time point, a procedure that
is integrated into the HDX Workbench software45.
Data Rendering: the HDX data from all overlapping peptides were consolidated
to individual amino acid values using a residue averaging approach. Briefly, for
each residue, the deuterium incorporation values and peptide lengths from all
overlapping peptides were assembled. A weighting function was applied in which
shorter peptides were weighted more heavily and longer peptides were weighted
less. Each of the weighted deuterium incorporation values were then averaged
incorporating this weighting function to produce a single value for each amino

 acid. The initial two residues of each peptide, as well as prolines, were omitted from
the calculations. This approach is similar to that previously described46.
Data Statistics: Deuterium uptake for each peptide is calculated as the average of
% D for all on-exchange time points and the difference in average %D values
between the apo and ligand bound samples is presented as a heat map with a color
code given at the bottom of the figure (warm colors for deprotection and cool
colors for protection). Peptides are colored by the software automatically to display
significant differences, determined either by a > 5% difference (less or more
protection) in average deuterium uptake between the two states, or by using the
results of unpaired t-tests at each time point (p-value < 0.05 for any two time
points or a p-value < 0.01 for any single time point). Peptides with non-significant
changes between the two states are colored gray. The exchange at the first two
residues for any given peptide is not colored. Each peptide bar in the heat map view
displays the average Δ %D values, associated standard deviation, and the charge
state. Additionally, overlapping peptides with a similar protection trend covering
the same region are used to rule out data ambiguity.
Homology modeling. A structural model of the VDR (aa 18–455)/RXRα (aa
135–462) heterodimer bound to the DR3 VBS DNA fragment was created using
Molsfot ICM Pro software. Amino Acids 201–223 of RXRα and 166–216 of VDR
could not be modeled due to the lack of available homology models containing
these amino acid residues. The heterodimer was created in the “open” con-
formation and a partial cryo-EM model (generous gift from Professor Bruno
Klaholz and Dino Moras) was used to guide the creation of the model. Loops that
could not be modeled from the cryo-EM data were added (mostly in the hinge
regions) and hydrogen atoms were added to all amino acids and both ligands. The
added loops were subject to loop modeling to improve clashing using the ICM-Pro
loop modeling utility. The final structure was subjected to minimization, regular-
ization, and annealing in ICM Pro.
BGLAP and TRPV6 activation assays. Human osteosarcoma cells MG-63, (CRL-
1427, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA), were main-
tained in EMEM (ATCC 30–2003) + 10% FBS in 5% CO2. For bone gamma-
carboxyglutamate protein (BGLAP) expression analysis MG-63 cells, suspended in
EMEM (ATCC 30–2003) + 5% charcoal dextran treated FBS, were seeded onto 96-
well tissue culture treated plates at 25,000 cells per well. After an overnight incu-
bation the medium was removed and serial dilutions of VDRMs in concentrations
ranging from 10 μM to 2 nM in EMEM (ATCC 30–2003) + 5% charcoal dextran
treated FBS were added. Following a 24 h incubation the medium was removed and
the plates were sealed and stored at −80 °C for later processing. QuantiGene 2.0
Assay Kit (Affymetrix QS0009) was used to quantitate BGLAP and the House-
keeping gene GUSB mRNA levels. Following the kit instructions, lysis buffer was
added to the frozen cells and incubated briefly at 55 °C. A volume of 20 μl of
BGLAP probeset (Affymetrix SA-10875-01) or 18 S (Affymetrix SA-10026) in
blocking buffer was added to the provided capture plates before adding 80 μl of the
cell lysate. The plates were sealed and incubated at 55 °C overnight. Following an
overnight incubation the capture plates were washed and the probes amplified
following kit instructions. The resulting luminescence signal was detected on an
Envision (Perkin Elmer). BGLAP signal was normalized using the 18S signal and
the resulting data was fit to a 4-parameter logistics to determine EC50.
C2BBe1 (a clone of CaCO2) cells (CRL-2101, American Type Culture
Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM (ATCC 30-2002)
supplemented with 10% FBS and insulin-transferrin-selenium-G supplement
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For TRPV6 expression analysis, cells were plated in 96-
well tissue culture treated plates (40,000 per well) in differentiation medium
(DMEM containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS and insulin-transferrin-sodium
selenite supplement (ITS)). Cells were allowed to differentiate for 6 days with
medium replacement every other day before compound treatment. The medium
was removed, and serial dilutions of 1,25D3 or VDRMs in concentrations ranging
from 10 μM to 2 nM in differentiation medium were added. After 24 h, the medium
was removed, and cell plates were sealed and frozen at −80 °C until assayed.
QuantiGene 2.0 Assay Kit (Affymetrix QS0009) was used to quantitate TRPV6 and
housekeeping gene GUSB mRNA levels. Following the kit instructions, lysis buffer
was added to the frozen cells and incubated briefly at 55 °C overnight. Following an
overnight incubation the capture plates were washed and the probes amplified
following kit instructions. The resulting luminescence signal was detected on an
Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer). TRPV6 signal was normalized using the
GUSB signal and the resulting data was fit to a 4-parameter logistic to determine
EC50 values.
Gel retardation analysis. Full-length VDRRXRα heterodimer (10 μM, 20 μl) in
protein buffer was incubated with respective VBS (2X molar ratio) or anti VDR
antibody (5 μl, 200 μg/ml, sc-13133, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min on ice
before mixing with 5 μl Hi-Density TBE sample buffer (Invitrogen). These reac-
tions were analyzed on a 6% DNA Retardation gel (Invitrogen) in 0.5X TBE buffer.
Electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 150 V at room temperature.
Gel was stained with ethidium bromide and coomassie blue for DNA and protein
visualization, respectively.
