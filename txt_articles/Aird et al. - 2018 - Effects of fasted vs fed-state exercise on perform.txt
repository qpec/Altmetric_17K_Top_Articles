Abstract 
The effects of nutrition on exercise metabolism and performance remains an important topic among 
sports scientists, clinical, and athletic populations. Recently, fasted exercise has garnered interest as 
a beneficial stimulus which induces superior metabolic adaptations to fed exercise in key peripheral 
tissues. Conversely, pre-exercise feeding augments exercise performance compared with fasting 
conditions. Given these seemingly divergent effects on performance and metabolism, an appraisal of 
the literature is warranted. This review determined the effects of fasting vs. pre-exercise feeding on 
continuous aerobic and anaerobic or intermittent exercise performance, and post-exercise 
metabolic adaptations. A search was performed using the MEDLINE and Pubmed search engines. The 
literature search identified 46 studies meeting the relevant inclusion criteria. The Delphi list was 
used to assess study quality. A meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed where 
appropriate. Findings indicated that pre-exercise feeding enhanced prolonged (P = 0.012), but not 
shorter duration aerobic exercise performance (P = 0.687). Fasted exercise increased post-exercise 
circulating FFAs (P = 0.023) compared to fed exercise. It is evidenced that pre-exercise feeding 
blunted signalling in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue implicated in regulating components of 
metabolism, including mitochondrial adaptation and substrate utilisation. This review’s findings 
support the hypothesis that the fasted and fed conditions can divergently influence exercise 
metabolism and performance. Pre-exercise feeding bolsters prolonged aerobic performance, while 
seminal evidence highlights potential beneficial metabolic adaptations that fasted exercise may 
induce in peripheral tissues. However, further research is required to fully elucidate the acute and 
chronic physiological adaptations to fasted vs. fed exercise.

1. Introduction 
The relationship between exercise, nutrition and metabolism is complex, and the molecular 
mechanisms by which they interact are not fully characterised. Investigating novel diet-exercise 
interactions holds relevance for the sports nutrition sphere, as optimising metabolic and training 
adaptations to exercise is a critical determinant of athletic performance1, 2. Moreover, current 
literature has assessed the efficacy of combining nutritional and exercise interventions to improve 
metabolic health biomarkers including insulin sensitivity, glucose and lipid metabolism3, 4. 
 
Recently, fasting-based interventions such as intermittent fasting have garnered interest as 
alternatives to conventional dietary strategies for improving metabolic biomarkers in both healthy 
and clinical populations5, 6. This is based on the hypothesis that such interventions act on similar 
biological pathways to conventional methods, while potentially being a more feasible long-term 
approach. Fasting is characterised by the absence of energy intake for sustained time periods, 
ranging from several hours to days7. Most individuals spend time fasting overnight while sleeping 
(~8-10h), but the duration of this period may vary depending on habitual eating patterns and time 
spent sleeping. As the fasted period continues past the first few hours, substrate utilisation 
predominantly shifts from glycogenolysis to utilising lipids for energy8, and expression of genes 
involved in lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in various peripheral tissues are upregulated9.

Regular aerobic exercise improves metabolism in different peripheral tissues, including skeletal 
muscle, liver and adipose tissue10-12. In skeletal muscle, exercising in the fasted state promotes 
utilisation of fatty acids and intramuscular triglycerides as primary fuel sources while suppressing 
glucose metabolism compared with fed conditions, both after acute exercise and in response to a 
chronic training intervention13-15. This proposedly occurs via altered gene and protein expression of 
various downstream targets including pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4), AMP-
activated protein kinase (AMPK), glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) 
and fatty acid translocase (CD36) 13, 14, 16. Moreover, long-term fasted exercise is evidenced to 
upregulate activity of mitochondrial enzymes such as citrate synthase (CS) and β –hydroxyacyl 
coenzyme A dehydrogenase (β-HAD) compared with the carbohydrate-fed state15. These findings 
support the rationale that training in a glucose-deprived state induces adaptations, which improve 
fuel efficiency and utilisation during exercise. However, regarding studies investigating potential 
divergent responses to exercise in fasted or fed conditions, changes in acute exercise studies may 
not necessarily be directly applicable to studies investigating chronic training adaptations and the 
responses to feeding vs. fasting. 
 
Interestingly, a recent fasted vs. fed exercise trial found that pre-exercise feeding blunted the 
expression of several key genes involved in adipose tissue metabolism17. These findings again 
indicate that acute nutritional status can profoundly affect the magnitude of post-exercise 
physiological adaptations in important endocrine tissues. Given that these cellular adaptations are a 
critical determinant of exercise performance, understanding these mechanisms and the potential 
role of nutrition in optimising these adaptations is imperative. Pre-exercise carbohydrate feeding 
benefits continuous aerobic exercise performance18, but research has recently focused on 
alternative nutritional strategies that can simultaneously enhance both metabolism and 
performance, such as training in a protein fed, but carbohydrate-depleted state19. Clearly, an

appraisal of the current literature in the inter-related areas of fasting, metabolism and exercise 
performance is warranted. The effects of fasted vs. fed state exercise on substrate utilisation during 
exercise have been summarised elsewhere20, and are beyond the scope of this review. However, 
gaps in the literature remain regarding an appraisal of post-exercise metabolic and performance 
responses to exercise in fasted and fed conditions. This systematic review and meta-analysis 
summarised current findings regarding the effects of fasting vs. fed pre-exercise conditions on post-
exercise metabolic and performance adaptations to continuous aerobic, anaerobic and intermittent 
exercise. For the purposes of this review, aerobic and anaerobic exercise are defined by the 
metabolic pathways which primarily contribute to energy provision during these types of exercise. 
Intermittent exercise is characterised as exercise comprising periods of high intensity exercise 
interspersed with lower intensity exercise. 
 
2. Methods 
This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 21.  
 
2.1 Study selection 
This review evaluated randomised and non-randomised control trials (parallel and crossover designs, 
blinded and non-blinded), Latin square designs and case studies. Continuous aerobic, anaerobic and 
intermittent exercise were established as protocols of interest, with acute and chronic interventions 
being included. Studies had to compare the same exercise intervention in both fasted and fed 
conditions. To be included in final analyses papers had to assess performance or post-exercise 
metabolism. Human adults (aged ≥18 years) were selected as the target population in this review. 
Healthy and clinical, as well as trained and untrained study populations were included.

In order to specifically assess the effects of pre-exercise nutritional status on metabolism and 
exercise performance, studies where feeding occurred during exercise were excluded. The fasting 
condition was required to be that of an overnight fast (minimum 8 hours) or longer. Studies where 
ergogenic aids, such as caffeine, were consumed pre-exercise were excluded. Similarly, studies using 
intravenous infusions of nutrients or corresponding tracer infusions during exercise were also 
excluded from final analyses. Studies assessing only substrate metabolism changes during exercise in 
fasted and fed conditions were excluded as this has previously been comprehensively reviewed by 
Vieira et al.20. Ramadan fasting may have potential confounding effects on exercise performance or 
metabolism such as sleep deprivation or reduced caloric intake22, 23, thus studies comparing the 
effects of Ramadan fasting vs. fed state exercise were also excluded. 
 
2.2 Literature search 
The electronic databases MEDLINE (via the EBSCO platform) and Pubmed were searched from 
inception until April 2017, and updated on June 28th 2017. The specific search criteria used for this 
systematic review was as follows: ((((("exercise"[MeSH Terms]) OR "aerobic") OR "intermittent") OR 
"interval")) AND ((("fasting"[MeSH Terms]) OR (“fast” OR “fasting” OR “time-restricted feeding” OR 
“fasted state” OR “energy restriction” OR “fed” OR “carbohydrate loading” OR “low carbohydrate” 
OR “glucose deprived” OR “glucose depleted" OR “diet restriction” OR "low glucose” OR "fasted"))). 
Articles were limited to human studies in adult populations. Additionally, hand searching of 
reference lists was also completed on studies included in this review and other relevant papers.

2.3 Data extraction and quality assessment 
A step by step overview of data extraction and study selection processes involved in this review are 
included below (figure 1). Data extracted from selected papers included author, year of publication, 
journal publication, study design, population type, number of participants, sex, age, training status, 
fasting condition, feeding condition, intervention frequency and duration, exercise type, exercise 
duration and intensity, statistical tests used, performance measures, metabolic measures and 
statistical outcomes of each study. The methodological quality of studies included for review were 
assessed using the Delphi list, a criteria list developed by Delphi consensus between international 
experts in the field of quality assessment of randomised clinical trials24. 
 
2.4 Data Analysis 
Effect size (Hedges g [g]) were calculated for each trial (fed vs. fasted [k]) using a pooled standard 
deviation, and mean difference between the fasted and fed groups or conditions groups25. The 
obtained effect is interpreted according to Cohen26 (0.2 = ‘small’; 0.5 = ‘medium’; 0.8 = ‘large’). 
Heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran’s Q (Q) and I2. Heterogeneity was observed between study 
effect sizes (ES) (Performance [Q = 61.1, P = 0.068, I2 = 25 %]; circulating glucose and free fatty acids 
[FFA]  [Q ≤ K-1]), and as methodology differed between studies (e.g. performance measure, 
population [i.e. sex, training status], feed type, dose, and timing) a random effects model was used 
to calculate the pooled ES for exercise-performance, and post-exercise circulating glucose and FFA, 
with a [lower : upper] 95 % confidence interval25, 27 (R Studio 1.1.383) . A meta-regression was used 
to determine moderator effects for fitness level (VO2max), feed type (carbohydrate or mixed meal, 
fat), feed proximity to exercise (outside of or within 60 minutes) and performance type measure 
(long duration exercise [> 60 minutes] vs. short-duration exercise [< 60 minutes]) (SPSS 24).  Four

moderators were selected a priori based on theoretical relation, supporting empirical evidence, and 
k25, 28, 29. 
 
3. Results 
In total, 13138 studies were identified from database searching in Pubmed and Medline, which were 
screened by title and abstract after removal of duplicates. Of these, 99 were included for full text 
review, with a further 75 papers excluded due to not meeting the relevant inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. The remaining 24 papers were included in final analyses. A further 22 studies were identified 
for inclusion through manually searching references lists of other relevant papers. Table 1 shows the 
summary characteristics of included studies which assessed the effects of fasted vs. fed state 
exercise on metabolic or performance adaptations. 
 
3.1 Quality assessment 
The results for quality assessment using the Delphi list are summarised in table 1. Studies were 
ranked based on a maximum possible score of 9 criteria which evaluate different indicators of study 
quality. Rankings were defined as excellent (≥8), very good (6-7), moderate (4-5), and low (≤3) 
quality study design. There were certain issues with specific aspects of quality in several studies. No 
studies reported whether or not treatment allocation was used, while 18 studies did not implement 
intention-to-treat analyses. Blinding of participants was a challenge in some studies given the nature 
of their design, for example if a study was investigating the effects of a pre-exercise meal vs. fasting 
condition on exercise performance. Consequently only 16 studies included a blinding measure for 
participants.

3.2 Exercise performance 
Collectively, 23 studies assessed performance during acute exercise. Of these, 20 evaluated 
responses to continuous aerobic exercise, while 3 determined performance changes in fasted vs. fed 
conditions during anaerobic or intermittent exercise. One study investigated the effects of a 6 week 
intervention on anaerobic exercise performance markers. Summary outcomes of these studies are 
presented in table 2. A small feeding ES was observed for continuous aerobic exercise performance 
(k = 47; g = 0.2 [0 : 0.3]; Z = 1.77; P = 0.076). ES varied by exercise performance duration only (β = 
0.326, P = 0.011). A difference in overall ES was observed for sub-group analysis between short and 
long duration exercise performance (Z = 2.150; P = 0.032). A small feeding ES was observed for long 
duration exercise performance (k = 25; g = 0.3 [0.1 : 0.5]; Z = 2.51; P = 0.012), whereas, no feeding 
effect was observed for short duration exercise performance (k = 22; g = 0 [-0.3 : 0.2]; Z = 0.40; P = 
0.687).  
 
Aerobic exercise 
Most studies in this review evaluated the effects of fasted vs. fed exercise on performance during 
continuous long-duration aerobic exercise (> 60 minutes). Of these, 54% found that pre-exercise 
feeding improved performance31, 47, 54, 55, 61, 67, 72, while the remainder evidenced no difference 
between fasted and fed groups30, 35, 37, 58, 59, 62. Regarding studies showing a beneficial effect of acute 
pre-exercise feeding on aerobic exercise performance, 1 provided a mixed meal61, 1 implemented a 
high carbohydrate meal67, and 5 provided predominantly carbohydrate as an energy source31, 47, 54, 55, 
72. A further 7 studies evaluated markers of shorter duration (< 60 minutes) aerobic performance53, 
56, 60, 63, 64, 69, 70. Of these, 57% found no differences in performance between fasted and fed 
conditions53, 56, 63, 64. The remaining studies determined that pre-exercise feeding bolstered time trial

performance60, 69, 70. Of these, 2 provided carbohydrates69, 70, while the other provided carbohydrate-
based meals60 as pre-exercise feeding condition. 
 
Anaerobic and intermittent exercise 
Four studies in this review assessed anaerobic and intermittent exercise performance. Galloway et 
al.45 found that pre-exercise carbohydrate ingestion improved time to exhaustion during anaerobic 
exercise compared with fasted conditions. Regarding intermittent exercise, 3 studies found that 
performing high intensity interval training (HIIT) in fasted or fed conditions did not affect 
performance measures over a single exercise bout or following a chronic intervention46, 57, 66.

3.3 Metabolism  
Forty-five studies in this review assessed post-exercise changes in metabolic biomarkers between 
fasted and fed conditions. Fuel metabolism responses were evaluated in 42 studies, while 14 papers 
determined changes in endocrine signalling in fasted and fed exercise states. Additionally, 4 trials 
assessed metabolic signalling in peripheral tissues between fasted and fed conditions. Summary 
outcomes for these studies are presented in table 2. 
 
Glucose 
Forty-two studies assessed changes in circulating glucose and/or insulin in response to exercise in 
fasted or fed conditions, with 10 identifying significant changes in post-exercise glucose levels

between fasted and fed conditions. Six trials determined that glucose was increased in fed 
conditions following submaximal17, 40 or prolonged aerobic exercise 30, 47, 70, 72. The remaining studies 
indicated glucose was greater in fasted conditions following acute anaerobic45, 49, 50 or submaximal 
exercise68. Feeding conditions eliciting increases in glucose following exercise compared with fasted 
conditions included a mixed meal30, 40, a glycerol bolus47, a carbohydrate based meal17, an oral 
carbohydrate solution70 and low/high glycaemic index (GI) carbohydrates72. Conversely, feeding 
interventions which resulted in lower blood glucose compared with fasting included an oral 
carbohydrate solution45, a glucose bolus49, 50 and a mixed meal68. Gillen et al.46 observed no 
differences in oral glucose tolerance responses to 6 weeks of fasted vs. fed state HIIT. No overall 
pooled effect was observed post-exercise for circulating glucose (k = 35; g = 0.1 [-0.2 : 0.4]; Z = 0.83; 
P = 0.406). No moderator effects were observed for any variable within the meta-regression (P ≥  
470). 
 
Eight studies demonstrated significant changes in post-exercise insulin concentrations between 
acute nutritional conditions. Of these, 88% indicated increased insulin in fed conditions17, 40, 41, 49, 50, 57, 
70, while another study indicated insulin was raised post-exercise in fasted conditions52. However, 
while a statistically significant post-exercise increase in insulin was observed by Isacco et al.52 in 
fasted compared with fed conditions, a difference of ~6 pmol·L–1 may be quite small in biological 
terms. Feeding conditions in these studies included a mixed meal40, a carbohydrate-based meal17, 41, 
57, a glucose bolus49, 50 and an oral carbohydrate solution70. Two studies assessed metabolic 
responses to anaerobic exercise49, 50 while a third evaluated responses to acute intermittent 
exercise57. Gillen et al.46 found no differences in insulin sensitivity between groups following 6 weeks 
of fasted or fed state HIIT.

Free fatty acids 
FFA concentrations were elevated in 38% of studies where it was measured in the fasted vs. fed 
condition17, 40, 47, 57, 63, 64, 70, 72. A large fasting effect was observed for post-exercise circulating FFA (k = 
36; g = 0.7 [0.1 : 1.2]; Z = 2.27; P = 0.023). No moderator effects were observed for any variable (P ≥ 
0.351). 
 
Metabolic hormone signalling 
Fourteen studies included in analyses evaluated changes in metabolic hormone signalling in fasted 
and fed exercise conditions, with 35% finding significant differences between groups36, 40, 43, 57, 61. 
Cappon et al.36 evidenced that performing anaerobic exercise after high-fat diet feeding reduces 
growth hormone secretion while elevating somatostatin levels, compared with fasted conditions. 
Another 3 studies identified altered endocrine signalling between fasted and fed conditions during 
continuous aerobic exercise40, 43, 61. Two studies found that exercising after consuming a mixed meal 
induced lower adrenaline levels in healthy subjects40 and diabetic patients43. A third study 
demonstrated that fasted exercise raised noradrenaline levels compared with fed conditions 
following consumption of a mixed meal61. Finally, an acute HIIT study found post-exercise 
catecholamine concentrations were elevated following a high GI meal compared with exercise in the 
fasted state57. 
 
Skeletal muscle metabolism 
Metabolic signalling changes in skeletal muscle were assessed in response to both anaerobic49, 50 and 
intermittent exercise46, however no studies meeting our inclusion criteria evaluated such changes in 
response to continuous aerobic exercise. Gillen et al.46 implemented a chronic HIIT intervention

where untrained overweight/obese women exercised in fasted conditions or after consuming a 
carbohydrate-based meal. Although HIIT exerted significant effects on various skeletal muscle 
biomarkers, no differences were observed between fasted and fed conditions in mitochondrial 
markers of enzymatic activity such as CS or β-HAD. Conversely, 2 studies assessing responses to 
acute anaerobic exercise following glucose feeding vs. fasting demonstrated differences between 
these conditions in a number of signalling markers. Guerra et al.50 found that glucose ingestion 
significantly blunted the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
(STAT3), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 
(SOCS3) when compared with fasting conditions during recovery. A similar investigation49 
determined that glucose ingestion prior to anaerobic sprint exercise blunted the elevation of 
Thr172-AMPKα phosphorylation seen in the fasting group while the relative change in Ser485-
AMPKα1/Ser491-AMPKα2 activation was significantly raised by glucose ingestion. Ser473-Akt 
phosphorylation was also increased immediately post-exercise in the glucose group compared with 
fasting conditions. Moreover, protein expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) was elevated 120 minutes after 
fasted exercise, but glucose feeding blunted this response.  
 
Adipose tissue metabolism 
Little evidence exists on the effects of exercising in fasted and fed conditions on metabolic signalling 
in adipose tissue. A recent seminal paper determined the effects of exercising in fasted vs. fed 
conditions on adipose tissue messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of key enzymes 
involved in lipid metabolism17. This study demonstrated that ingestion of a carbohydrate-based meal 
before prolonged aerobic exercise blunted the mRNA expression of PDK4, adipose triglyceride lipase 
(ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), CD36, GLUT4 and insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2). 
Furthermore, IRS2 protein expression was elevated under fasting conditions compared with pre-
exercise feeding.

4. Discussion 
4.1 Exercise performance 
For continuous aerobic exercise, several studies found no changes between fasted and fed 
conditions, although pre-exercise feeding bolstered prolonged (> 60 minutes) aerobic capacity 
compared with fasted conditions. The similar performance responses between fasted and fed 
conditions in individual studies may be attributed to different factors. These may include using an 
alternative fuel source to carbohydrates or a carbohydrate-based meal59, 62, a reduced magnitude of 
performance responses in trained vs. untrained study populations30, 37, 58, or a large study population 
heterogeneity in terms of aerobic capacity35. Findings on shorter duration exercise (< 60 minutes) 
demonstrated no overall performance effect for either fasted or fed exercise. The effects of pre-
exercise feeding on anaerobic and intermittent exercise performance also indicate no differences 
between short or long-term fasted vs. fed state HIIT46, 57, 66, while one study evidenced improved 
anaerobic performance after pre-exercise feeding45. These equivocal findings may reflect the fact 
that each study used different exercise protocols, or that pre-exercise feeding simply does not 
bolster intermittent exercise performance.  Whilst differences were observed between short and 
long-duration exercise performance, given the small amount of studies evaluating performance 
responses to anaerobic and intermittent exercise it remains difficult to make definitive inferences 
from results pertaining to this specific mode of exercise.  
 
Overall results indicated that performance was not affected by pre-exercise feed timing. 
Interestingly, in the 4 studies where feeding occurred 3-4 hours pre-exercise, performance was 
categorically improved60, 61, 67, 69. This could reflect increases in muscle/liver glycogen stores which 
are not attained when feeding is timed in the 60 minutes before exercise75, thus enhancing 
performance. Only 2 studies in this review assessed the effects of nutrient ingestion at multiple time

points45, 66. Pritchett et al.66 found no differences in intermittent exercise performance when feeding 
occurred 15 or 60 minutes pre-exercise. Conversely, Galloway et al.45 demonstrated that 
carbohydrate ingestion 30 minutes before anaerobic exercise bolstered performance compared with 
fasted conditions. Given the lack of available evidence, further research is required to determine if 
pre-exercise feed timing influences anaerobic or intermittent exercise performance. 
 
Meal composition and GI remain topics of debate in sports nutrition76, and its effects on 
performance were compared in 4 studies31, 55, 57, 72. Of these studies, 75% determined that ingesting 
low/moderate GI carbohydrates pre-exercise improved prolonged aerobic capacity compared with 
fasting conditions, while high GI carbohydrates did not enhance performance. Endurance 
performance may improve as a result of enhanced fat oxidation and slower glucose release observed 
following low GI carbohydrate ingestion76, thus preserving glycogen stores for higher intensity 
exercise. Thomas et al.72 had similar findings, with low GI food consumption inducing lower 
carbohydrate oxidation rates during prolonged exercise compared with high GI ingestion. While not 
all studies report performance enhancements from low GI compared with high GI carbohydrate 
ingestion, no studies report performance decrements in response to low GI food consumption18. 
While of interest, these limited findings make it difficult to ascertain if GI truly influences exercise 
performance. 
 
4.2 Metabolism 
Several acute studies evidenced post-exercise circulating glucose increases in fed vs. fasted 
conditions following continuous aerobic exercise. This may reflect increased glucose availability for 
fuel utilisation, or potential increases in glycogenolysis observed during prolonged exercise77. 
Conversely, glucose increased, while insulin was decreased during acute fasted vs. fed anaerobic

exercise in 3 studies45, 49, 50. Similar findings are observed elsewhere78 and potentially indicate greater 
demands for glucose utilisation during high intensity exercise. The comparable results observed in 
some studies in terms of post-exercise circulating substrates may potentially be explained by the 
sample population characteristics. Metabolic flexibility is a key determinant of the ability to shift 
from glucose to fat oxidation during different physiological conditions, such as the fasted vs. fed 
state79. Moreover, metabolic flexibility is purportedly influenced by environmental factors, including 
training status and fat mass80. Interestingly, of the 8 studies using sedentary and/or 
overweight/obese sample populations, 75% evidenced no changes in post-exercise glucose, insulin 
or FFAs between fasted and fed conditions. This may potentially explain the lack of change in these 
measures observed in these trials. 
 
The effect of fasted vs. fed state exercise on skeletal muscle metabolic signalling was also 
evaluated46, 49, 50. Regarding long-term fasted vs. fed state exercise responses, Gillen et al.46 
suggested that adaptations to intermittent exercise are similar irrespective of pre-exercise 
nutritional condition. However, other evidence has not investigated if chronic adaptations to 
intermittent exercise differ between fasted and fed conditions. Conversely, differences in metabolic 
signalling were detected between acute fasted and fed conditions following sprint exercise49, 50. 
Fasted Wingate exercise increased SIRT1 expression and phosphorylated AMPK49, whereas pre-
exercise glucose ingestion abated these effects. AMPK has myriad downstream effects on gene 
expression and is implicated in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, substrate utilisation and 
autophagy81. SIRT1 is purportedly implicated in regulating metabolic processes primarily concerning 
mitochondrial adaptation10, 82, and its increased nuclear abundance has been previously observed 
following HIIT83. Moreover, evidence indicates anaerobic exercise acts as a leptin signalling 
mimetic50. Similar to SIRT1 and AMPK, pre-exercise glucose ingestion partially or wholly blunted 
leptin signalling responses, similarly suggesting that fasted conditions may optimise metabolic

signalling adaptations. AMPK is a critical regulator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α), the so-called “master regulator” of mitochondrial biogenesis, 
and its activation upon energy depletion in muscle phosphorylates PGC-1α, resulting in increased 
mitochondrial gene expression84. SIRT1 also proposedly plays a role in mediating PGC-1α in 
peripheral tissues85. While no differences in PGC-1α expression were observed between acute 
nutritional conditions here, fasted sprint exercise may induce superior molecular signalling 
responses to fed conditions over a prolonged timeframe, potentially translating to improved chronic 
adaptations. However, these hypotheses have not been conclusively answered in the literature. 
 
Circulating FFA concentration was greater following fasted vs. fed exercise. These findings were 
evidenced during prolonged exercise, suggesting that triglyceride mobilisation from adipose tissue is 
increased, in turn elevating circulating FFA concentrations for potential use as fuel86. Interestingly, 
Chen et al.17 presented seminal evidence concerning the mechanisms by which lipid mobilisation 
from adipose tissue occurs in response to fasted exercise. Specifically, mRNA expression of key 
lipolytic enzymes such as ATGL and HSL87 were upregulated during fasted, but not fed exercise. 
Moreover, studies which evidenced endocrine signalling changes during fasted exercise bolstered 
these findings. Circulating levels of adrenaline40, 43, noradrenaline61 and growth hormone36 were 
increased in fasting conditions. Catecholamines are critical in the activation of fasting-induced 
lipolysis88, while growth hormone also stimulates this process89. Collectively, these findings outline 
potential mechanisms by which fasted exercise promotes lipid utilisation compared with fed 
conditions.

4.3 Perspectives 
The review’s findings indicate that fasted vs. fed exercise conditions differentially affect 
performance and post-exercise metabolism. Pre-exercise feeding enhances performance during 
prolonged (> 60 minutes) aerobic exercise, whereas performance did not differ during shorter 
duration aerobic exercise between fasted and fed conditions. Several individual studies suggest 
nutrient timing and meal composition influence exercise performance, and these factors should be 
tailored based on exercise type. Additionally, consuming lower GI compared with high-GI 
carbohydrates may augment prolonged aerobic performance. Regarding metabolism, fasted exercise 
mobilises and promotes FFA utilisation, with seminal evidence outlining potential mechanisms by 
which this occurs in adipose tissue. Fasted training activates signalling pathways which beneficially 
regulate metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle, whereas pre-exercise feeding abrogates such 
effects. However, significant literature gaps remain regarding this topic. Further research is 
imperative to elucidate the effects of fasted vs. fed exercise on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue 
metabolism, particularly following a chronic intervention. Similarly, unconventional feeding 
conditions such as the low-carbohydrate or protein-fed state, have not been thoroughly investigated 
regarding their effects on metabolism and performance. Future studies are required to establish 
nutritional strategies which optimise metabolic and performance adaptations to exercise.
