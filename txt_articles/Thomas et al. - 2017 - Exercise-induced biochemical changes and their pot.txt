 Exercise-induced biochemical changes and their
potential influence on cancer: a scientific review
Robert James Thomas,1 Stacey A Kenfield,2 Alfonso Jimenez3
ABSTRACT
Aim To review and discuss the available international
literature regarding the indirect and direct biochemical
mechanisms that occur after exercise, which could
positively, or negatively, influence oncogenic pathways.
Methods The PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and
Cochrane libraries were searched for papers up to July
2016 addressing biochemical changes after exercise with
a particular reference to cancer. The three authors
independently assessed their appropriateness for
inclusion in this review based on their scientific quality
and relevance.
Results 168 papers were selected and categorised into
indirect and direct biochemical pathways. The indirect
effects included changes in vitamin D, weight reduction,
sunlight exposure and improved mood. The direct effects
included insulin-like growth factor, epigenetic effects on
gene expression and DNA repair, vasoactive intestinal
peptide, oxidative stress and antioxidant pathways, heat
shock proteins, testosterone, irisin, immunity, chronic
inflammation and prostaglandins, energy metabolism
and insulin resistance.
Summary Exercise is one of several lifestyle factors
known to lower the risk of developing cancer and is
associated with lower relapse rates and better survival.
This review highlights the numerous biochemical
processes, which explain these potential anticancer
benefits.
INTRODUCTION
Exercise is one of several lifestyle factors known to
lower the risk of developing cancer.1–8 Moreover,
the benefits of exercise continue after diagnosis.
There is increasingly convincing evidence that,
especially within supervised programmes, exercise
mitigates many of the adverse toxicities common
among
cancer
survivors
and
improves
overall
quality of life.9–12 Observational cohort studies of
patients diagnosed with cancer have also linked
regular exercise, either at the work place or domes-
tic physical activity, with a lower probability of
relapse or cancer-specific death after initial radical
treatments.13–19 As there is a deficiency of rando-
mised data, some could argue that cohort studies
are merely observing habit-forming linkages. People
who exercise, for example, are less likely to smoke,
have a healthier body mass index (BMI) and eat
more vegetables.20 Although this remains a possibil-
ity, most analyses have adjusted for other lifestyle
behaviours that may be associated with exercise and
the outcome (potential confounders) using multi-
variate analysis, and the association of exercise with
cancer outcomes in diverse patient populations
shows high consistency.19 21–24
The lack of randomised control trials (RCT) data
for clinical end points (ie, progression, death) is
being addressed by ongoing studies such as the
CHALLENGE study (Colon Health and Life-Long
Exercise Change),25 the INTERVAL-MCRPC study
(Intense Exercise for Survival among men with
Metastatic
Castrate-Resistant
Prostate
Cancer)26
and the PANTERA study (Exercise as Treatment for
Men with Prostate Cancer) starting enrolment in
2016. The precise mechanisms elucidating the
anticancer effects of exercise have not been fully
established; biomarker analyses within these trials
as well as additional preclinical experimental data
will provide critical supporting evidence. In the
mean time, this article summarises the available
international literature and discusses the potential
indirect and direct biochemical mechanisms of how
physical activity (exercise) could positively, or nega-
tively, influence oncogenic pathways.
METHODOLOGY
In this scientific review, we searched for published
trials assessing the biological changes that occur
after physical activity, which could influence cancer-
promoting or progression pathways, via the follow-
ing resources: Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane and
PubMed. The search terms used were physical
activity, exercise, cancer and biological changes. W
e
also scrutinised the references within the landmark
papers published on this subject to ensure we did
not miss any relevant papers. W
e found 222 unique
clinical published papers and listed them according
to the Preferred reporting items for systematic
reviews and meta-analyses systemic review guid-
ance.27 Three authors independently assessed their
appropriateness for inclusion in this review accord-
ing to guidelines suggested by Sanderson et al28
and excluded studies with inappropriate selection
of participants; inappropriate measurement of vari-
ables and controls or where not written in English.
In addition, we included the most relevant labora-
tory studies, which had the highest scientific rele-
vance to this review which included 168 papers in
total. For ease of explanation, these have been split
into direct and indirect separate pathways but there
is considerable overlap between them.
Direct anticancer pathways
An array of direct biological, epigenetic, metabolic
and inflammatory changes occur in the body after
exercise, acutely and over time.29 30 It is not yet,
however, established which one, or combination of
these, has the most significant influence on cancer
pathways. The most notable candidate mechanisms
are summarised here, in no particular order of
importance.

 Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and its binding proteins,
insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs), have a
central role in the regulation of cell growth. After binding to its
receptor tyrosine kinase, IGF-1 activates several signalling path-
ways, leading to the inhibition of apoptosis, the promotion of
cell growth and angiogenesis.31–33 Higher levels of IGF-1 would
therefore be expected to increase tumour growth, and have
been reported to be associated with a greater cancer risk.34 35
An inverse relationship is reported with IGFBP3 levels although
this effect has not been confirmed in all studies.36 Exercise has
been shown to increase the levels of IGFBP3 and lower IGF-1,
and in a large prospective cohort study of 41 528 participants,
this was associated with a 48% reduction of cancer-specific
deaths.29 Decreased levels of IGF-1 in physically active patients
have also been linked to an improved survival.37
Epigenetic effects on gene expression, DNA repair and telo-
mere length: Exercise can influence the phenotype expression of
inherited genes via epigenetic biochemical alterations to chro-
mosomes, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation,
expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and changes of the chro-
matin structure.38 39 Which of these epigenetic changes that
have the most influence on cancer remains uncertain.38 39 A
prospective pilot trial involving men with low-risk prostate
cancer found a set of RAS family oncogenes (RAN, RAB14 and
RAB8A) to be downregulated after a healthy exercise and life-
style programme.40 In the prostate, RAN (ras-related nuclear
protein) may function as an androgen receptor coactivator, and
its expression is increased in tumour tissues.40 Another study
involving men on active surveillance, showed that 184 genes
were differentially expressed between individuals who engaged
in vigorous activity compared with sedentary individuals. Genes
particularly sensitive to exercise included those involved in sig-
nalling cell cycling and those supporting DNA repair including
BRCA1 and BRCA2 via histone deacetylase and miRNA path-
ways.41 42 The same upregulation of BRCA expression following
exercise has been demonstrated in the rat mammary gland and
clinically in women who were BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation car-
riers.43 44 Markers of an improved cellular repair process were
also reported in a study,45 which showed that exercise upregu-
lated the key regulator gene p53 and by doing so, encourages
damaged cells to repair or if not possible, self-destruct.43 45
T
elomeres, the sequences of nucleotides at the end of the chro-
mosomes that protect their integrity, are shortened with each cell
division, so telomere length correlates with biological age.39
Exercise has epigenetic effects on the telomere as well, which help
to prevent its deregulation by protecting it from transcription
errors caused by transcription of non-coding RNA, which occur
during cell division.39 In a clinical study involving men with early
prostate cancer, those regularly exercising and eating healthily had
longer telomeres and reduced prostate-specific antigen progres-
sion compared with sedentary controls with less healthy diets.46
Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide that
increases
proliferation,
survival,
androgen
resistance
and
de-differentiation in human breast and prostate cancer cells
lines.47–49 Serum VIP has been shown to transiently increase
after acute exercise.49 50 For example, in an experiment involv-
ing 30 min of bicycle riding, increased levels were detected for
∼20 min, although the rise was higher if the individual was
sleep-deprived and lower if adequate glucose levels were main-
tained.51 This transient rise leads to the production of natural
anti-VIP antibodies which explains the observation that indivi-
duals who regularly exercise have lower VIP titres.52 Patients
with breast and prostate cancer have been found to have higher
VIP titres compared with matched pairs in the general popula-
tion without cancer.52 53
Oxidative stress and antioxidant pathways: Exercise, particularly
if strenuous, produces reactive oxidative species (ROS) that, if sig-
nificant, increases oxidative stress on DNA, which could poten-
tially contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer.54 55 In
response to this transient increase in ROS, especially after regular
training, an adaptive upregulation of antioxidant genes occurs
which results in greater production of antioxidant enzymes such as
superoxide dismutase, glutathione and catalase.56–58 In a pilot
study at the University of California, men who participated in
≥3 hours/week of vigorous physical activity had greater expression
of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) in their
normal prostate tissue compared with men who did less physical
activity. The Nrf-2 protein stimulates the production of antioxi-
dant enzymes and activation of other protective genes.41 Other
studies have confirmed that trained individuals also have greater
levels of antioxidant enzymes which would potentially increase
their defence against environmental and ingested oxidising carci-
nogens.55 57 59 60 If nutritional deficiencies exist to impair the pro-
duction of antioxidant enzymes or strenuous exercisers are elderly
,
where this adaptive process is known to be slower, there is a
danger that strenuous exercise could do more harm than
good.57 60 It is important, therefore, that attention is given to
nutritionally healthy polyphenol-rich foods that enhance upregula-
tion of antioxidant enzymes.9 56 57 59 60
Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are produced in tissues, in
response to a wide variety of physiological and environmental
insults including infection, hypoxia, hyperthermia, dexametha-
sone and chemotherapy.61 62 They have cytoprotective functions
including blocking apoptosis and allowing the cell to survive
potentially lethal events; hence, they are substantially overex-
pressed following a myocardial infarction.56 They are also
increased acutely following a bout of exercise.56 61 63 This acute
rise in HPS is significantly lower in trained athletes and is most
pronounced after severe anaerobic exercise, especially if the par-
ticipant is previously unfit.56 61 63 An increase in HSP is the
hypothesised mechanism for exercise in protecting the heart in
numerous animal studies and clinically in women with breast
cancer receiving adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy
regimens who are physically active.61 64 65 An increase in HPS
is also the suggested mechanism for exercise in reducing cogni-
tive impairment during chemotherapy, by protecting the astro-
cytes and supportive cells within the brain.66
There is a potential downside to this adaptive pathway, as
cancer cells have learnt to harness the antiapoptotic properties
of HSP
, and hence HSP are markedly overexpressed in several
cancer
types.63
Some
cancers
have
even
become
HSP-dependent for their survival, which makes them an inter-
esting
potential
therapeutic
target.67
Whether
exercise
increases HSP to a clinically meaningful level to protect
cancers cells is not yet known, although the addition of very
high levels of HSP to cell lines in one laboratory experiment
did increase resistance to anthracyclines.68 As cancer cells
produce their own HSP in high quantities, it is unlikely that
the changes in serum HSP after exercise have any influence
on intratumoural levels.65 This is supported by a recent
experiment in mice that reported a better cancer response to
adriamycin with concomitant exercise.64 Nevertheless, further
research is needed in humans to confirm whether it is appro-
priate to advise patients, who are unaccustomed to rigorous
activities, to perform anaerobic exercise just before or imme-
diately after chemotherapy.69

 T
estosterone: High levels of androgens are associated with a
higher incidence of prostate cancer,70 but what happens to tes-
tosterone after exercise is complex and depends on the under-
lying level of fitness, exercise intensity and even mood at the
time of training.71 It is widely stated that serum testosterone
increases immediately after vigorous exercise,71–73 but this has
not been confirmed in all studies.74 75 This effect also appears
to be very short-lived, around 15 min to an hour after exercise
with levels returning to pre-exercise levels by 2 hours.72 76 77 It
is also often quoted that resistance training increases testoster-
one more than endurance exercises but there is very little to sub-
stantiate this in the literature. In fact, endurance exercise and
resistance training have been reported to cause a transient
increase in testosterone levels in men and women in a number
of studies.71–73 76 It is important to note that these studies
report that testosterone-binding protein also rises with exercise
so the free, biologically active, testosterone proportion changes
little.78 Furthermore, this transient testosterone rise has not
been reported in men over 55 years, when men are at increased
risk of prostate cancer.74
75 More importantly, over time,
regular moderate or intense exercise actually lowers testosterone
as well as luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone
due to a negative feedback mechanism and this can be a symp-
tomatic issue for trained athletes.71 72 79 80 This effect has been
observed clinically following 30-day, 12-week and 12-month
programmes.71 73 79 81 There are some studies reporting that a
healthy
lifestyle,
including
exercise,
delayed
the
natural
age-related decline in testosterone but this was only linked to
obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and dyslipidaemia, which
causes testosterone deficiency.82 Current studies are inconclusive
as to whether exercise further lowers serum androgen levels in
men already taking androgen deprivation therapy (ADT),83
although this is further complicated by inadequate methods for
measuring testosterone levels in very low ranges.84
Irisin is a type I trans-membrane messenger protein, which is
produced in muscle cells in response to exercise.85 One study
reported that higher levels were linked to more favourable
breast cancer prognostic risk at diagnosis.86 In laboratory
studies, irisin significantly reduced cancer cell proliferation,
migration and viability in malignant cancer cell lines, without
affecting
non-malignant
cells.87
In
another
study,
irisin
enhanced the cytotoxic effect of the chemotherapy agent, doxo-
rubicin, when added to malignant breast cells, which again was
not observed in non-malignant cells.87 This reduction in malig-
nant potential of irisin, however, was not observed with colon,
thyroid and oesophageal cancer cell
lines.88 Furthermore,
reports questioned the existence of circulating human irisin as it
was felt that human irisin antibodies used in commercial ELISA
kits lacked required specificity.89 However, a recent experiment
used
tandem
mass
spectrometry
to
compare
irisin
levels
between sedentary participants and those following aerobic
interval training, so the antibody shortcomings were circum-
vented, and they found a significant difference.90
Immunity: During exercise, increased levels of catecholamines
stimulate the recruitment of leucocytes into the peripheral
blood, resulting in increased concentrations of neutrophils, lym-
phocytes and monocytes, including natural killer (NK)-cells,
CD4+ T cells and B cells, and potentially improve immune sur-
veillance against cancer.91 92 On the other hand, if exercise is
too strenuous for that individual, it is followed by decreased
concentrations of lymphocytes and impaired cellular-mediated
immunity.93 As a consequence, in another study there was an
increase in risk of an infection in the weeks following a competi-
tive
ultra-endurance
running
event.94
Following
moderate
exercise regimes, however, particularly with regular training,
most long-term studies suggest exercise improves immune func-
tion in all age groups.91 92 Its benefits are particularly clinically
relevant in the elderly whose immune function is becoming less
efficient,95 96 or obese individuals whose NK-cell numbers in
blood and in solid organs, together with their cytotoxicity and
cytokine secretion, are reduced.97 This also implies a benefit for
individuals with impaired immunity after cancer treatments, but
these studies have yet to be conducted.58
Chronic
inflammation
and
prostaglandins:
Although
an
inflammatory response is an important part of a healthy innate
immunity, persistent low-grade increased chronic inflammatory
activity
is
associated
with
age-related
diseases
such
as
Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis.98 99 Higher levels of
inflammatory markers have also been found to be associated
with cancer incidence, more advanced cancers at presentation
and an increased risk of cancer-specific mortality.99–102 Markers
of chronic inflammation are higher among individuals who are
overweight, sedentary, those with poor diets, type II diabetes
and the elderly.96 103 One reason for this stems from overcom-
pensation of an ailing immune system trying to maintain immu-
nosenescence.93 95 96 In these groups, poor interleukin (IL)-2
production leads to a decreased cytotoxic capacity of NK and T
lymphocytes on a ‘per cell’ basis. To compensate for this, higher
levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as C reactive protein,
tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, cytokine antagonists and
acute phase proteins are produced which increase concentra-
tions of NK cells and T cells.93 95 96 103 104 Exercise is known
to enhance NK cell activity and increase T-cell production redu-
cing the need for the immune system to compensate by increas-
ing circulating inflammatory biomarkers.83 91 92 105
Another reported mechanism concerns a mediator in the
inflammatory pathway called apoptosis-associated speck-like
protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC).38 45
ASC activates procase-1, which in turn activates the release of
ILs and other inflammatory cytokines including TNF. The tran-
scription status of the ASC gene is influenced by the epigenetic
factors mentioned above, particularly methylation. Regular exer-
cise upregulates the methylation of ASC, resulting in decreased
activity of the gene in human monocytes.39
Prostaglandins, which are biologically active lipids generated
from arachidonic acid via the enzyme cyclo-oxidase (COX), also
have an influence on chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis.
The COX-1 enzymes are present in normal tissues and upregu-
late in response to trauma, infection or chemical injury, increas-
ing prostaglandins, which in turn triggers an appropriate
inflammatory cascade as part of a healthy immune response.
COX-2 is also induced by cytokine growth factors but has
higher expression in many tumours.106 Chronically increased
overproduction of prostaglandins, generated via COX-2, has
been implicated in cancer progression, apoptosis, invasion,
angiogenesis and metastases.107
108 Anti-inflammatory drugs
and salicylates found in painkillers and fresh vegetables108 have
been shown to reduce COX-2 activation of prostaglandins
which could explain their reported anticancer properties.109–111
Moderate, regular and non-traumatic exercise also reduces
serum prostaglandin levels.112 113 For example, a study involv-
ing biopsies of rectal mucosa showed that leisure-time physical
activity was inversely associated with prostaglandin-2 concentra-
tion (PGE2). Overweight individuals (BMI>25 kg/m2) also had
increased mucosal concentrations. Most importantly, an increase
in activity level from 5.2 to 27.7 MET-hours per week was asso-
ciated with a 28% decrease in mucosal PGE2 even before weight
loss.114 This was confirmed in another study from Italy; subjects

 with type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, which
showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise were inde-
pendent of achieving weight loss.115
Energy metabolism and insulin resistance: It has long been
established that exercise reduces plasma insulin levels leading to
increased insulin sensitivity in volunteers and athletes, but more
recently this biochemical response has been reported in exercise
intervention studies involving breast cancer survivors.116
117
Likewise, a number of RCTs have shown that exercise improves
insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism even in men receiving
ADT
, who have a significant risk of metabolic syndrome,118 119
including adiposity and increased lipids and sarcopenia.120 121
Hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia secondary to insulin
resistance are associated with an increased risk of cancer, poorer
prognostic features at presentation, higher risk of relapse after
initial treatments and more rapid progression in men with
castration-resistant prostate cancer.32 99 117 120 122 In addition,
high levels of C peptide, a marker of insulin secretion, are asso-
ciated with a more than twofold increased risk of prostate
cancer-specific mortality.36 One contributory factor for these
worse outcomes may be resistin, also known as adipose tissue-
specific secretory factor, which is a cysteine-rich adipose-derived
peptide hormone that increases with insulin resistance through
AMP kinase downregulation. Resistin is known to upregulate
proinflammatory cytokines, which act via the nuclear factor
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκb) pathway
to increase transcription of proteins involved in cell prolifer-
ation, inflammation and antiapoptosis.123 124
Indirect anticancer pathways
Several non-direct factors contribute to anticancer biochemical
benefits of exercise. As displayed in tables 1 and 2, there is
overlap between direct effects of exercise and indirect effects
gained from weight reduction particularly via leptin, adiponec-
tin oestrogen and inflammatory markers but for clarity they
have also been included in this section along with improvements
in serum lipids, sunlight exposure and elevated mood:
Obesity, oestrogen, leptin and the effects of weight reduction:
The neuropeptide cytokine leptin and sex hormone oestrogen
are generated in fat cells, so overweight, particularly postmeno-
pausal women, have higher endogenous levels.125 144 Leptin is
known to promote breast cancer directly and independently, as
well as through involvement with the oestrogen and insulin sig-
nalling pathways, via enhanced angiogenesis and cell prolifer-
ation,164 which explains the links between higher levels of leptin,
adiposity and hormone-related cancers such as breast, prostate
and ovary cancer.29 70 117 126–128 144 Conversely, serum concen-
tration of another adipokine cytokine, adiponectin, is inversely
correlated with adiposity, breast and prostate cancer risk most
likely
because
it
has
anti-inflammatory
properties.129–131
Furthermore, adiponectin also suppresses inactivation of nitric
oxide which dose-dependently diminishes an increased tendency
of
tumour
cell-induced
platelet
aggregation.132
T
umour
cell-induced platelet aggregation increases metastatic potential by
‘cloaking’ tumour cells with adherent platelets, protecting them
from NK-cell-mediated killing.133
A number of studies have shown that exercise programmes
help individuals to lose weight16
134–136 and some of these
demonstrated that weight reduction resulted in lower serum sex
hormones and leptin levels.137 It is unlikely, however, that a
reduction in adiposity is a major anticancer mechanism because
exercise programmes, at best, only usually show a modest

 reduction in weight.136 138–140 Furthermore, there is evidence
that even before weight reduction occurs, exercise directly
lowers serum oestrogen and leptin levels and raises adiponectin
levels independent of weight loss.137 139 141 142 In one clinical
study, this was quantified as every 100 min of exercise giving a
3.6% lowering of serum oestrogen.143
Exercise and dietary modification help weight control and
lower serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and improve the
ratio of high density lipoprotein to low density lipoprotein.143
Epidemiological studies have suggested that high levels of chol-
esterol in the blood are associated with increased risk of cancer
and progression of cancer.154–156
Vitamin D levels and sunlight exposure: These are both higher
among those who exercise outdoors regularly146 as UV-B radia-
tion’s interaction with the skin produces most of the body’s
required vitamin D. Excess sunlight, particularly associated with
sunburn, is the main cause of epithelial skin damage, premature
ageing and skin cancers and clearly should be avoided. On the
other hand, regular sensible sun exposure has an anticancer
property by maintaining adequate serum vitamin D levels.146
The mechanism by which vitamin D influences the incidence
and progression of cancer is thought to be due to calcitriol’s
effect on cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.147–
149 The vitamin D receptor is highly expressed in epithelial cells
known to be at risk of carcinogenesis, such as the breast, skin
and prostate.125 Higher vitamin D levels are associated with
lower colorectal, breast and prostate cancer mortality.150 151 165–
168 Despite this, a direct causational link has not been estab-
lished nor has any benefit of correcting vitamin D levels with
supplementation; important limitations regarding the dose,
adherence and induction period could explain these findings.151
Sunlight exposure, independent of vitamin D levels, has been
linked to a lower incidence of prostate cancer.152 It has been
postulated
that
the
benefit
of
sunlight
exposure
may
be
mediated through vitamin D and other pathways and mechan-
isms such as modulation of the immune system and the circa-
dian rhythm.153
Psychological well-being: As well as being distressing, anxiety
and depression have been linked to reduced survival following
radical cancer treatments.62 157 Of note, a large prospective
cohort study from California reported that 4.6% of 41 000
men, who were clinically depressed after prostate cancer diagno-
sis, had a 25% reduction in disease-specific survival compared
with non-depressed men.158 Another trial involving individuals
from Korea with head and neck cancer reported similar find-
ings.145 Regular exercise, especially if in groups and combined
with relaxation, mindfulness and healthy eating programmes
have been shown to help alleviate mood, and reduce anxiety
and fear of relapse.25 159–162 The mechanism by which exercise
helps fight depression has not yet been firmly established but
hypotheses
include
increased
endorphin
and
monoamine
release, mental distraction, rises in core temperatures and better
compliance to medical interventions.145
158
159 In addition,
light exposure, which increases with outdoor exercise, has been
linked to a reduction in non-seasonal depressive disorders.163
In conclusion, clinical studies suggest a significant benefit for
regular exercise after cancer for improving well-being and disease
outcomes.30 The most feasible biochemical pathways, supporting
a direct and indirect anticancer mechanism of action, have been
summarised in this article but there are likely to be others yet to
be reported. It also remains unclear which of these mechanism
has the most important role, or whether they vary by person or
by disease. Although they have been subclassified, for ease of
explanation in this article, they are clearly inter-related, especially
the inflammation, immunity and insulin resistance pathways. In
the UK, despite these benefits, which are being highlighted by
patient advocacy groups and charities, levels of exercise after
cancer remain poor,169 while funding for a national exercise pro-
gramme has been hampered by the shortage of RCTs. Given the
magnitude of the potential benefits of exercise, more multicentre
RCTs evaluating disease outcomes, combined with biochemical
determinants, are clearly needed. The forthcoming INTERVAL
and PANTERA studies and ongoing CHALLENGE study are
most welcomed.
What are the findings?
▸ This is a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the
biological effects of exercise which may affect cancer.
▸ This review highlights the shortfalls in knowledge and
understanding of exercise biochemistry.
▸ An investigation of the biological processes which may affect
cancer.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the near
future?
▸ Provide a detailed understanding of cancer and exercise,
essential for clinical trial development.
▸ A useful summary of the effects of exercise for exercise
scientists and oncologists interested in cancer rehabilitation.
▸ This summary provides the biological evidence to help
motivate patients into exercise programmes.
