Summary
Background Interest in the use of cannabis and cannabinoids to treat chronic non-cancer pain is increasing, because 
of their potential to reduce opioid dose requirements. We aimed to investigate cannabis use in people living with 
chronic non-cancer pain who had been prescribed opioids, including their reasons for use and perceived 
effectiveness of cannabis; associations between amount of cannabis use and pain, mental health, and opioid use; 
the effect of cannabis use on pain severity and interference over time; and potential opioid-sparing effects of 
cannabis.
Methods The Pain and Opioids IN Treatment study is a prospective, national, observational cohort of people with 
chronic non-cancer pain prescribed opioids. Participants were recruited through community pharmacies across 
Australia, completed baseline interviews, and were followed up with phone interviews or self-complete 
questionnaires yearly for 4 years. Recruitment took place from August 13, 2012, to April 8, 2014. Participants were 
asked about lifetime and past year chronic pain conditions, duration of chronic non-cancer pain, pain self-efficacy, 
whether pain was neuropathic, lifetime and past 12-month cannabis use, number of days cannabis was used in the 
past month, and current depression and generalised anxiety disorder. We also estimated daily oral morphine 
equivalent doses of opioids. We used logistic regression to investigate cross-sectional associations with frequency of 
cannabis use, and lagged mixed-effects models to examine temporal associations between cannabis use and 
outcomes.
Findings 1514 participants completed the baseline interview and were included in the study from 
Aug 20, 2012, to April 14, 2014. Cannabis use was common, and by 4-year follow-up, 295 (24%) participants had 
used cannabis for pain. Interest in using cannabis for pain increased from 364 (33%) participants (at baseline) to 
723 (60%) participants (at 4 years). At 4-year follow-up, compared with people with no cannabis use, we found that 
participants who used cannabis had a greater pain severity score (risk ratio 1·14, 95% CI 1·01–1·29, for less 
frequent cannabis use; and 1·17, 1·03–1·32, for daily or near-daily cannabis use), greater pain interference score 
(1·21, 1·09–1·35; and 1·14, 1·03–1·26), lower pain self-efficacy scores (0·97, 0·96–1·00; and 0·98, 0·96–1·00), and 
greater generalised anxiety disorder severity scores (1·07, 1·03–1·12; and 1·10, 1·06–1·15). We found no evidence 
of a temporal relationship between cannabis use and pain severity or pain interference, and no evidence that 
cannabis use reduced prescribed opioid use or increased rates of opioid discontinuation.
Interpretation Cannabis use was common in people with chronic non-cancer pain who had been prescribed opioids, 
but we found no evidence that cannabis use improved patient outcomes. People who used cannabis had greater pain 
and lower self-efficacy in managing pain, and there was no evidence that cannabis use reduced pain severity or 
interference or exerted an opioid-sparing effect. As cannabis use for medicinal purposes increases globally, it is 
important that large well designed clinical trials, which include people with complex comorbidities, are conducted to 
determine the efficacy of cannabis for chronic non-cancer pain.

Introduction
The use of prescribed opioids in the treatment of chronic 
non-cancer pain is controversial because of insufficient 
evidence for their long-term effectiveness1,2 and increased 
harms as opioid prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain 
has increased.3,4
Alternatives to opioids are increasingly being debated 
and considered. Reviews of cannabinoids suggest they 
might have efficacy in some chronic non-cancer pain 
conditions.5–7 In the USA,8 Canada,9 and the Netherlands,10 
chronic non-cancer pain is the most commonly cited 
reason for use of cannabis for medicinal purposes.

Furthermore, there is increasing discussion about the 
potential opioid-sparing effects of cannabinoids.11 Changes 
in regulations mean that there could be an increase in use 
of cannabinoid products for chronic non-cancer pain.
Longitudinal studies of cannabis use among people 
with chronic non-cancer pain are scarce. Randomised 
controlled studies typically exclude individuals with 
complex physical, substance use, and mental health 
comorbidities, who represent a substantial proportion of 
people living with chronic non-cancer pain.12 Evidence on 
efficacy in the most common causes of chronic non-
cancer pain—namely, back or neck problems, arthritis, 
and migraine, is scarce.7,13 Long-term follow-up in 
prospective 
studies 
is 
insufficient, 
with 
most 
being 
12 
months 
or less.14–16 Discussion about the opioid-sparing effects of 
cannabinoids has often been confined to ecological studies 
or cross-sectional surveys, which are poorly suited for 
testing causal hypotheses.
We used the Pain and Opioids IN Treatment (POINT) 
study, a national cohort of people with chronic non-
cancer pain who had been prescribed opioids, to examine 
cannabis use and pain outcomes over 4 years. We aimed 
to investigate the following: cannabis use during a 4-year 
period in people with chronic non-cancer pain who had 
been prescribed opioids, including their reasons for use 
and perceived effectiveness of cannabis; associations 
between amount of cannabis use in the past month and 
pain, mental health, and opioid use; the effect of cannabis 
use on pain severity and interference over time, 
controlling for potential confounding of demographic 
and clinical variables; and potential opioid-sparing effects 
of cannabis, controlling for potential confounding 
variables.
Methods
Study design and participants
Full details of the study design and measures included 
have been published elsewhere.12,17 POINT participants 
were recruited through community pharmacies across 
Australia (appendix). We did not have a planned period of 
recruitment, but aimed to recruit until we reached 
1500 participants. Recruitment took place from August 13, 
2012, to April 8, 2014. Participants were aged 18 years or 
older, living with chronic non-cancer pain (defined in this 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The potential use of cannabinoids in chronic non-cancer pain 
has raised substantial interest. We did a literature review by 
searching MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and 
ClinicalTrials.gov in July, 2017, with no language restrictions, for 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies 
relating to all cannabinoid types and specific chronic 
non-cancer pain conditions and pain-related outcomes. We 
used the following search terms: “Cannabinoids”, “Cannabis”, 
“cannab*”, “marijuana”, “marinol”, “dronabinol”, “nabilone”, 
“levonantradol”, “tetrahydrocannabinol”, “cesamet”, “delta-9-
THC”, “delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol”, “nabiximols”, “sativex”, 
“cannabidiol”, “therapeutic use”, “analgesics”, “medical 
marijuana”, “medicinal cannabis”, “pain”, “chronic pain”, 
“Neuralgia”, and “neuropathic pain”. We identified 
91 publications, containing 104 studies, which included 
47 randomised control trials and 57 observational studies. We 
found the pooled change in pain intensity (standardised mean 
difference −0·14, 95% CI −0·20 to −0·08) was equivalent to 
3 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale greater than placebo. 
We graded the quality of evidence as moderate using an 
adapted version of the standard Grades of Recommendation, 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. Existing clinical 
studies of the effects of cannabinoids on chronic non-cancer 
pain mainly consisted of RCTs done using a restricted range of 
cannabinoids in a small range of chronic non-cancer pain 
conditions and lacked clarity in reporting of pain outcomes.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, our study is one of the longest, in-depth, 
prospective studies of a community cohort of people with 
various types of chronic non-cancer pain that examined the 
effects of cannabis use on pain and prescribed opioid use during 
4 years of follow-up. Cannabis use was common in our cohort, 
patients reported that it reduced their pain, and interest in 
using cannabis for pain doubled in the cohort during the 4-year 
follow-up. Nonetheless, patients who had used cannabis had 
greater pain severity and interference, lower pain self-efficacy, 
and greater generalised anxiety disorder severity than did 
patients who had not used cannabis. Unlike recent reviews that 
suggested a positive effect of cannabinoids on pain and a 
reduction in opioid use, we found no evidence of a temporal 
relationship between cannabis use and pain severity or pain 
interference, and no evidence that cannabis use reduced 
prescribed opioid use or increased rates of opioid 
discontinuation.
Implications of all the available evidence
Previous systematic reviews suggested there is moderate 
evidence that cannabinoids are effective for certain types of 
pain. Previous evidence has been scarce because of studies with 
short duration and exclusion of participants with complex 
clinical profiles. In our 4-year prospective cohort of people 
prescribed opioids for chronic non-cancer pain, we did not find 
evidence supporting claims that cannabis and cannabinoids 
improved outcomes in chronic non-cancer pain, nor that they 
reduced prescription opioid use. To date, evidence that 
cannabinoids are effective for chronic non-cancer pain and aid 
in reducing opioid use is lacking. Large, well designed clinical 
trials are required to evaluate in which patients cannabinoids 
might be effective in reducing pain severity, interference, and 
opioid doses.

study as pain lasting longer than 3 months), taking 
prescribed schedule 8 opioids (including fentanyl, 
morphine, oxycodone, buprenorphine, methadone, and 
hydromorphone) for chronic non-cancer pain for longer 
than 6 weeks, competent in English, mentally and 
physically able to participate in telephone and self-
complete interviews, and did not have any serious 
cognitive impairments, as determined by the interviewer 
at the time of screening. A history of injecting drug use 
was not an exclusion criterion, but people currently 
prescribed pharmaceutical opioids for opioid substitution 
therapy for heroin dependence or cancer were not eligible 
for inclusion.

consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
participants. This study was approved by the Human 
Research Ethics Committee of the University of New 
South Wales (reference #HC12149 and #HC16916).
Measures
The measures, tools, and data domains were based on 
recommendations made by the Initiative on Methods, 
Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials.18,19 
Details of the interview procedure are provided in the 
appendix. Baseline interviews comprised a phone 
interview and self-complete survey and were done from 
Aug 20, 2012, to April 14, 2014. 3-month self-complete 
surveys were done as close to 3 months after baseline 
interview as possible and occurred from Nov 15, 2012, to 
Nov 1, 2014. The 3-month self-complete questionnaire was 
a reduced questionnaire with a smaller number of 
measures included and is therefore not included in the 
current analysis as many of the measures used, such as 
Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) and questions 
regarding cannabis use, were not included. Furthermore, 
for consistency in analyses, we used interviews which were 
12 months apart. 12-month self-complete questionnaires 
occurred 12 months after baseline interviews, between 
Aug 28, 2013, and Dec 4, 2015. 2-year interviews were done 
from Aug 12, 2014, to March 23, 2016. The 3-year interview 
was part of a new funding grant and all participants were 
interviewed annually by calendar year. 3-year interviews 
took place between Jan 11, 2016, and Jan 3, 2017
. 4-year 
follow-ups were done from Jan 9, 2017, to Dec 12, 2017
.
We collected data on age, sex, relationship status, and 
current work status. Relationship status and work status 
data were collected at all timepoints. Sex and age data 
were collected only at baseline.
Participants were asked about chronic pain conditions 
in their lifetime and during the past year, and duration 
of chronic non-cancer pain. As pain is only one of several 
core outcomes to consider when evaluating interventions 
for chronic non-cancer pain,18 we used the pain severity 
and interference (how pain affects sleep, daily living, 
working ability, and social interaction) subscales of the 
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI),20 with higher scores 
indicating greater pain severity or interference (score 
range 0–10).
Pain self-efficacy relates to an individual’s beliefs about 
the extent to which they can do daily activities despite 
their pain; this was measured using the PSEQ21 (score 
out of 60, higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy). 
Participants were asked at baseline “Is your pain 
neuropathic? That is, pain that burns or tingles (either 
diagnosed by self or doctor).”
Daily oral morphine equivalent doses of opioids, in mg 
per day, were estimated using conversion units 
established through synthesis of clinical references,22 
using a medication diary. At each follow-up, we confirmed 
whether participants were still taking a schedule 8 opioid.
Participants were asked about lifetime and past 
12-month use of cannabis, and number of days used in 
the past month, in general and for pain specifically. 
Frequency of cannabis use in the past month was 
categorised as no use (0 days), less frequent use (1–19 days), 
and near-daily or daily use (≥20 days of cannabis use, 
approximately five times a week or more).

Participants who reported lifetime use of cannabis for 
pain but had discontinued use were asked their reasons 
for doing so. Those who reported past 12-month cannabis 
use were asked further questions about reasons for use 
(appendix). All participants were asked “If you had access 
to cannabis, would you want to use it?” at each wave 
(excluding the 1-year follow-up). Based on a similar 
question in the BPI, we asked participants to rate the 
effectiveness of cannabis for their pain on a scale of 0 (no 
relief) to 10 (complete relief).
Current depression and generalised anxiety disorder 
were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 
(PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale 
(GAD-7).23,24 We defined moderate to severe depression as 
a PHQ-9 score of 10 or greater.23 We defined moderate to 
severe anxiety as a GAD-7 score of 10 or greater.24 We 
used the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 
3.0 substance use module to assess lifetime International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, Tenth Revision diagnostic codes for harmful 
use and dependence.25
Statistical analysis
We aimed to recruit 2000 participants, but then limited 
this number to 1500 because of funding and time 
constraints. For descriptive statistics, means and SDs 
were computed when data were normally distributed, 
and medians and IQRs when data were skewed.26
To 
investigate 
cross-sectional 
associations 
with 
cannabis use frequency, we used multinomial logistic 
regression models for univariate comparisons of people 
at each wave who reported less frequent cannabis use 
and near-daily or daily cannabis use (compared with 
people who had not used cannabis). Variables identified 
in previous research as related to the outcomes were 
included. For interpretability, risk ratios (RRs) for oral 
morphine equivalent doses are reported per 100 units. 
Additional analyses of the demographic and clinical 
associations between prevalent and incident cannabis 
use are presented and discussed in the appendix.
For prospective associations between cannabis use and 
outcomes, we used lagged mixed-effects models to 
examine temporal associations between cannabis use (the 
exposure) and pain severity, pain interference, and oral 
morphine equivalent doses (the outcomes), incorporating 
a random intercept for individuals to account for the 
repeated measures design and examining unadjusted and 
adjusted associations. We analysed data from baseline 
interviews and the four annual follow-up waves, with 
outcomes for the following year, and constructed four 
models. In the first model, we compared the outcome of 
interest in people who used cannabis (less frequent use, 
and near-daily or daily use) versus those who had never 
used cannabis. In the second, we adjusted for the outcome 
at the previous wave. In the third, we additionally adjusted 
for clinical covariates identified in previous research as 
related to the outcomes (age, sex, duration of pain, 
generalised anxiety disorder severity, and history of 
substance use).26 Furthermore, for analysis of pain severity, 
we also adjusted for oral morphine, for pain interference, 
we adjusted for pain severity and oral morphine 
equivalent, and for oral morphine equivalent, we adjusted 
for pain severity. In the final model, we further adjusted 
for PSEQ results (we had some missing data as the PSEQ 
was not completed at the 1-year interview).
Analyses were done using Stata version 15.0. We used 
the Stata command margins (or mimrgns for multiple 
imputation) to obtain adjusted means. For details of 
sensitivity analyses see the appendix.

from work. Participants had been living with chronic 
non-cancer pain for a median of 10 years (IQR 4·5–20·0) 
and had been prescribed a strong opioid for a median of 
4 years (1·5–10·0). The median oral morphine equivalent 
taken was 75 mg/day (36–150). The most common types 
of pain reported at baseline were back or neck pain 
(1159 [77%] participants), followed by arthritis (933 [62%] 
participants), and comorbid pain was common, with 
participants reporting a median of two (IQR 2–3) chronic 
pain conditions at baseline in the preceding 12 months. 
937 (62%) participants reported neuropathic pain at 
baseline.
Using a random sample of 71 pharmacies, we compared 
the characteristics of all customers obtaining opioids 
during the 6-week recruitment window with the study 
cohort overall. Among 800 customers who recorded 
purchasing opioids in these pharmacies, 418 (52%) were 
female (vs 842 [55%] in the POINT cohort) and 58 (7%) 
were aged 18–34 years (vs 73 [5%]), 438 (55%) were aged 
35–64 years (vs 952 [62%]), and 304 (38%) were aged 
65 years or older (vs 489 [33%]). 500 (63%) people were 
prescribed oxycodone (vs 938 [62%] in the POINT cohort), 
138 (17%) were prescribed morphine (vs 225 [15%]), and 
190 (24%) were prescribed buprenorphine patches (vs 
332 [21%]).
At baseline, two-fifths of the cohort reported ever using 
cannabis, 195 (13%) reported use in the past 12 months, 
and 126 (9%) reported use in the past month. Both past 
12-month and past-month use increased from baseline to 
the 4-year timepoint (table 1).
At baseline, approximately one in six participants 
reported that they had used cannabis for pain in their 
lifetime. Past 12-month and past-month reporting of 
cannabis use for pain also increased over time. The 
proportion of participants reporting cannabis use on 
1–19 days (categorised as less frequent use) in the month 
before interview remained relatively stable. The pro-
portion reporting use on 20–31 days in the past month 
(categorised as near-daily or daily use) increased from 
3% at baseline to 7% at 4-year follow-up (table 1).
At baseline, participants who had used cannabis for 
pain rated its mean effectiveness for their pain as 6·5 out 
of 10 (with 10 being extremely effective; table 1). The 
percentage of participants reporting that they would use 
cannabis if they had access to it increased from 33% at 
baseline to 60% at 4-year follow-up.
At the 3-year and 4-year follow-up waves, participants 
who reported cannabis use in the past month were asked 
whether it influenced their use of opioid medication. 
Most participants reported that cannabis had no effect on 
their use of opioid medication (3-year follow-up 103 [78%] 
of 132 participants; 4-year follow-up 105 [70%] of 
151 participants). At 3-year follow-up, 29 (22%) of 
132 participants, and at 4-year follow-up, 46 (30%) of 
151 participants reported that they sometimes or regularly 
reduced their opioid medication when using cannabis 
(appendix). There were no differences in age, sex, pain 
severity or interference, or oral morphine equivalent 
between cannabis users who reported cannabis 
sometimes or regularly reduced their opioid use, 
compared with those who said it had no such effect (data 
not shown).
Of participants currently using cannabis, the most 
common reasons for use at both 3-year and 4-year follow-
up were to relieve pain (3-year follow-up 142 [83%] of 
174 
participants; 
4-year 
follow-up 
157 
[83%] 
of 
190 participants) and pain-related distress (3-year follow-
up 118 [68%] of 174 participants; 4-year follow-up 
140 [73%] of 192 participants), to improve sleep (3-year 
follow-up 116 [67%] of 174 participants; 4-year follow-up 
122 [64%] of 190 participants), and for general relaxation 
(3-year follow-up 126 [72%] of 175 participants; 4-year 
follow-up 124 [65%] of 192 participants; appendix). 
Participants who had previously used cannabis for pain, 
but were no longer doing so, were asked about their 
reasons for stopping. The most common reasons were 
side-effects (3-year follow-up 46 [28%] of 166 participants; 
4-year follow-up 31 [23%] of 134 participants), legal 
concerns (3-year follow-up 43 [26%] of 166 participants; 
4-year follow-up 24 [18%] of 134 participants), difficulties 
accessing cannabis (3-year follow-up 30 [18%] of 
166 
participants; 
4-year 
follow-up 
27 
[20%] 
of 
134 participants), and ineffectiveness in relieving pain 
(3-year follow-up 37 [22%] of 166 participants; 4-year 
follow-up 16 [12%] of 134 participants; appendix).

With a few exceptions, at each follow-up, people who 
were using cannabis (less frequent or daily or near-daily 
use) reported greater pain severity and pain interference, 
lower pain self-efficacy, and higher levels of generalised 
anxiety disorder than those not using cannabis (table 2). 
The associations were consistent for less frequent and 
near-daily users (table 2). For example, at the 4-year 
interview, compared with people with no cannabis use, 
those with less frequent and daily or near-daily use had 
greater pain severity scores, greater pain interference 
scores, lower pain self-efficacy scores, and greater 
generalised anxiety disorder severity scores.
Few differences were reported in oral morphine 
equivalent consumption or the proportion of participants 
who discontinued opioids between those using cannabis 
at different frequencies. However, people who reported 
less frequent cannabis use were less likely to discontinue 
opioids at 4 years (9%) than those reporting no use (21%), 
despite no difference in oral morphine equivalent at 
4-year follow-up (table 2).
Using lagged-effects models, we examined the effect of 
past cannabis use on current pain severity (table 3), current 
pain interference (table 4), and current oral morphine 
equivalent consumption (table 5) in people using cannabis 
compared with those not using cannabis (complete case 
analysis; for multiple imputation analysis see appendix). 
In the unadjusted model, near-daily or daily cannabis 
users had significantly greater pain severity than did 
people who had not used cannabis (difference of 0·5 on a 
10-point scale; table 3). This difference, although still 
significant, was reduced by inclusion of previous pain 
severity score. In adjusted models that included clinical 
covariates and pain self-efficacy, we found no association 
between past cannabis use and current pain severity.
People who had reported use of cannabis at the 
previous wave had greater pain interference at 
subsequent follow-up than did those who had not used 
cannabis (table 4). In adjusted models, after controlling 
for age, sex, previous pain interference, pain factors 
(eg, duration of pain, pain severity, and pain self-efficacy), 
and oral morphine equivalent, previous cannabis use 
was not independently associated with current pain 
interference.
We did not detect an association between cannabis use 
in the previous wave and reduced oral morphine 
equivalent at subsequent follow-up; we found no 
association in the univariate model and no independent

We did sensitivity tests to examine the robustness 
of the findings. Sensitivity analyses using log trans-
formations of oral morphine equivalent in categories 
(0 mg, 1–20 mg, 21–90 mg, 91–199 mg, and ≥200 mg)

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is one of the longest, in-depth, 
prospective studies of a community cohort of people with 
chronic non-cancer pain, examining the effects of 
cannabis use on pain and prescribed opioid use. Cannabis 
use was common in our cohort, patients reported that it 
reduced their pain, and the proportion interested in using 
cannabis for pain doubled over the 4-year follow-up. We 
found that patients who had used cannabis had greater 
pain severity and interference, lower pain self-efficacy, 
and greater generalised anxiety severity than did patients 
who had not used cannabis.
We found no evidence of a temporal relationship 
between cannabis use and pain severity or pain 
interference, and no evidence that cannabis use reduced 
prescribed opioid use or increased opioid discontinuation. 
The most common reasons for discontinuing cannabis 
use included side-effects, lack of efficacy, access 
difficulties, and legal concerns. Nonetheless, our data 
and other population surveys27 highlight growing 
community interest in using cannabis for pain.
A legislative change on Oct 30, 2016, decriminalised 
medicinal use and supply of cannabis and cannabinoids;13 
perceptions of efficacy and safety of cannabis for medical 
use might therefore increase in Australia, as they have 
done in other jurisdictions.28 Few data in our 4-year 
follow-up were collected after this change, and very few 
individuals nationally have accessed cannabinoids for 
medicinal purposes, so our cohort primarily used illicitly 
produced cannabis. Increased availability of medicinal 
cannabinoids might increase use among people living 
with chronic non-cancer pain in Australia, although 
access is still restricted and licensed cannabinoid 
medications are expensive. Additionally, in our study it is 
unlikely cannabis was consumed under the guidance of a 
medical practitioner. Expectations that cannabis will 
reduce pain and opioid use might differ for participants 
using medicinal cannabis compared with those using 
illicit cannabis. High-quality, double-blind, randomised, 
placebo-controlled trials examining expectancy effects, 
which are lacking for most chronic non-cancer conditions, 
might shed further light.
We found inconsistencies in our findings between 
what participants reported and our statistical assessment 
of associations. Although participants who used cannabis 
reported that the mean effectiveness of cannabis on pain 
was 7 out of a possible score of 10, in unadjusted cross-
sectional and longitudinal analyses, people who used 
cannabis in the past month reported greater pain severity 
and interference than those who had not used cannabis 
in the past month. In adjusted longitudinal analyses, we 
found no association between cannabis and pain severity 
or interference. This finding is inconsistent with previous 
studies that have found cannabis reduced pain severity.14–16
In our cohort, patients with chronic non-cancer pain 
who used cannabis reported significantly greater pain 
severity than those not using cannabis, consistent with 
surveys of medicinal users who report using cannabis 
because of a failure of conventional treatments.29,30 Those 
using cannabis with the intent of relieving their pain 
might represent a patient population with more distress 
and poorer coping mechanisms, as evidenced in our 
study by the lower pain self-efficacy scores for people 
who used cannabis. It could be that in the absence of 
cannabis use, pain severity and interference might have 
been worse. However, our study supports recent research 
that suggests cannabis use is associated with reduced 
self-efficacy in managing depression and anxiety.31 
Although previous reviews have found moderate support 
for cannabis use in reducing chronic non-cancer pain,5–7,8 
they have mainly relied on randomised controlled trials, 
in which people with complex comorbidities have been 
excluded. Considering recent findings31 and our study, it 
is important that future research focuses on self-efficacy 
and complexity of patients to better understand what 
types of patients with chronic non-cancer pain might 
benefit from using cannabinoids.
Previous cross-sectional studies have suggested 
cannabis might have opioid-sparing effects in people 
with chronic non-cancer pain,32,33 although a systematic 
review found a lack of high-quality clinical studies testing 
potential opioid-sparing effects.11 In our study, using both 
cross-sectional and longitudinal analytic approaches, we 
found no evidence that cannabis use was associated with 
reduced opioid use or opioid cessation. This finding 
needs to be qualified as participants had access only to 
illicit cannabis and were not taking cannabis as part of 
structured pain management under medical supervision.
To our knowledge, our study was unique in exploring 
temporal associations between cannabis use, pain, and 
opioid use in a large cohort with multiple assessment 
waves and low attrition. There might be concern that we 
did not recruit a representative sample of people 
prescribed opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. To 
appraise the generalisability of the study cohort, we 
collected data from a random sample of 71 pharmacies 
on the characteristics of all customers obtaining opioids 
during their 6-week recruitment window. These data 
showed important similarities between the cohort we 
recruited and customers overall in sex, age, and type of 
opioid prescribed.

Although our data were self-reported, this method of 
collection is reasonably reliable,34 particularly when there 
are no disincentives for being honest.35 All participants 
were assured of confidentiality and that the data would 
be de-identified; however, we did no independent checks 
of participant reports of cannabis use. Because of the 
illegality of cannabis during the study period, it is 
possible that cannabis use has been under-reported. 
However, other epidemiological studies that have 
reported cannabis use associated with reduced opioid 
consumption have also depended on self-reported 
cannabis and opioid use.32,33,36,37 Additionally, we recorded 
frequency of cannabis use, rather than quantity and type 
of cannabis, but there are major complexities in reliably 
measuring total cannabis consumption given variations 
in tetrahydrocannabinol content and amounts consumed 
in a session of use.38,39 Finally, although we found no 
significant association between cannabis use and pain, it 
is difficult to completely understand the effects of 
cannabis on pain in an observational study.
In conclusion, cannabis use is common in people with 
chronic non-cancer pain who have been prescribed 
opioids, and interest in medicinal use of cannabis is 
increasing. We found no evidence that cannabis use 
improved patient outcomes; those who used cannabis 
had greater pain and lower self-efficacy in managing 
pain. Furthermore, we found no evidence that cannabis 
use reduced pain interference or exerted an opioid-
sparing effect.
