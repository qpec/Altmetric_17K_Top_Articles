hen there is an arrest in the descent of the fetal head at 
midpelvic station during the second stage of labour, 
mode of delivery and perinatal and maternal outcomes 
are largely dependent on the urgency to expedite delivery and 
operator skill with midpelvic operative vaginal delivery.1,2 Operative 
vaginal delivery provides a temporal advantage over cesarean 
delivery, although midpelvic forceps or vacuum application 
requires skill and experience. Although cesarean delivery generally 
decreases the risk of birth trauma compared with instrument use, 
engagement of the fetal head in the pelvis means the risk of trauma 
is not eliminated by an emergency cesarean delivery.3,4 Assess-
ments of the balance of risks and benefits between midpelvic oper-
ative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery have tended to favour 
the latter option in recent decades, and this has contributed to a 
rising rate of cesarean delivery worldwide.1 In 2014, a consensus 
statement by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-
gists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine5 recommended 
operative vaginal delivery as a strategy to reduce the rate of cesar-
ean delivery. In Canada, midpelvic operative vaginal delivery 
accounts for over 20% of all operative vaginal deliveries and about 
2%–3% of term singleton deliveries.6
The literature on perinatal and maternal mortality and morbidity 
after operative vaginal delivery compared with cesarean delivery is 
inconsistent.7–16 In addition, studies on the risks and benefits of these

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Increased use of opera-
tive vaginal delivery (i.e., forceps or vac-
uum application), of which 20% occurs at 
midpelvic station, has been advocated to 
reduce the rate of cesarean delivery. We 
aimed to quantify severe perinatal and 
maternal morbidity and mortality associ-
ated with attempted midpelvic operative 
vaginal delivery.
METHODS: We studied all term singleton 
deliveries in Canada between 2003 and 
2013, by attempted midpelvic operative 
vaginal or cesarean delivery with labour 
(with and without prolonged second 
stage). The primary outcomes were 
composite severe perinatal morbidity 
and mortality (e.g., convulsions, 
assisted ventilation, severe birth trauma 
and perinatal death), and composite 
severe maternal morbidity and mortal-
ity (e.g., severe postpartum hemor-
rhage, shock, sepsis, cardiac complica-
tions, acute renal failure and death).
RESULTS: The study population 
included 187 234 deliveries. Among 
women with dystocia and prolonged 
second stage of labour, midpelvic oper-
ative vaginal delivery was associated 
with higher rates of severe perinatal 
morbidity and mortality compared with 
cesarean delivery (forceps, adjusted 
odds ratio [AOR] 1.81, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.24 to 2.64; vacuum, 
AOR 1.81, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.80; sequential 
instruments, AOR 3.19, 95% CI 1.73 to 
5.88), especially with higher rates of 
severe birth trauma. Rates of severe 
maternal morbidity and mortality were 
not significantly different after operative 
vaginal delivery, although rates of 
obstetric trauma were higher (forceps, 
AOR 4.51, 95% CI 4.04 to 5.02; vacuum, 
AOR 2.70, 95% CI 2.35 to 3.09; sequential 
instruments, AOR 4.24, 95% CI 3.46 to 
5.19). Among women with fetal distress, 
similar associations were seen for 
severe birth trauma and obstetric 
trauma, although vacuum was associ-
ated with lower rates of severe maternal 
morbidity and mortality (AOR 0.52, 
95% CI 0.33 to 0.80). Associations 
tended to be stronger among women 
without a prolonged second stage.
INTERPRETATION: Midpelvic operative 
vaginal delivery is associated with higher 
rates of severe birth trauma and obstet-
ric trauma, whereas overall rates of 
severe perinatal and maternal morbidity 
and mortality vary by indication and 
operative instrument.

2 options have been compromised by a lack of information on pelvic 
station, a key determinant of perinatal and maternal outcomes.17 
Therefore, we carried out a study aimed at quantifying the perinatal 
and maternal morbidity and mortality associated with attempted 
operative vaginal delivery at midpelvic station (compared with cesar-
ean delivery in labour), the point when the decision between cesar-
ean delivery and operative vaginal delivery is uncertain.
Methods
Setting and data source
The study population included hospital deliveries in Canada 
between April 2003 and March 2013. We obtained data from the Dis-
charge Abstract Database (Canadian Institute for Health Informa-
tion). This database contains information on about 98% of all deliver-
ies in Canada (excluding Quebec).18 Maternal and perinatal 
information in the database includes maternal characteristics, 
labour and delivery, neonatal condition, and diagnoses and proce-
dures. Diagnoses and procedures in medical charts made by physi-
cians were coded using the enhanced Canadian version of the 10th 
revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems (ICD-10-CA) and the Canadian Classification 
of Health Interventions. The accuracy of the perinatal information in 
the database has been shown in previous validation studies.19,20
Study design
We included all deliveries by midpelvic operative vaginal delivery 
or cesarean delivery with labour between 37 and 41 weeks gesta-
tion that resulted in a singleton live birth or stillbirth. We 
excluded deliveries if the infant had any congenital anomaly or if 
the mother had a hypertensive disorder, diabetes mellitus or a 
placental abnormality. Analyses contrasting midpelvic operative 
vaginal deliveries with cesarean deliveries were carried out after 
stratifying by indication (i.e., dystocia or fetal distress).
Deliveries at midpelvic station included operative vaginal 
delivery in cases where the head was engaged and the leading 
point of the fetal skull was above station +2 cm but below 0 sta-
tion.1 We used an intention-to-treat framework (i.e., both suc-
cessful and failed forceps or vacuum deliveries were included in 
the attempted midpelvic forceps or vacuum category).
Outcomes following midpelvic operative vaginal delivery are 
ideally compared with cesarean delivery carried out in the second 
stage of labour. Our data source identified cesarean deliveries 
with and without labour, but not cesarean deliveries carried out 
in the second stage of labour (except for those carried out after a 
prolonged second stage). Because second stage cesarean delivery 
is generally associated with greater morbidity than cesarean 
delivery in the active phase of labour,4 we conducted analyses 
that compared midpelvic operative vaginal delivery with cesarean 
delivery in labour after stratifying the analyses based on pro-
longed second stage of labour (using ICD-10-CA code O631). We 
anticipated that the comparison between operative vaginal and 
cesarean delivery among women with a prolonged second stage 
of labour would potentially favour operative vaginal delivery 
because a deeply engaged head can complicate cesarean deliv-
ery. However, comparisons between women without prolonged 
second stage of labour would potentially favour cesarean delivery 
because of the inclusion of women not in second stage.
Our study had 2 primary outcomes: composite severe perina-
tal morbidity and mortality, and composite severe maternal mor-
bidity and mortality. We defined severe perinatal morbidity and 
mortality to include neonatal convulsions, assisted ventilation by 
endotracheal intubation, severe birth trauma (e.g., intracranial 
laceration and hemorrhage, skull fracture, severe injury to the 
central or peripheral nervous systems, long bone injury, subapo-
neurotic hemorrhage and injury to the liver or spleen), stillbirth 
and neonatal death. We defined severe maternal morbidity and 
mortality to include severe postpartum hemorrhage (postpartum 
hemorrhage requiring transfusion), obstetric shock, sepsis, car-
diac complications (cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, myocardial 
infarction and pulmonary embolism), acute renal failure, obstet-
ric embolism and evacuation of incisional hematoma. Secondary 
outcomes included the components of the composite outcomes, 
as well as respiratory morbidity, outcomes related to asphyxia, 
severe cerebral morbidity, all birth trauma, maternal postpartum 
infection, maternal postpartum hemorrhage and obstetric 
trauma. Diagnosis and procedure codes used to define the study 
cohort are listed in Appendix 1 (Supplementary Table 1), available 
at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161156/-/DC1.
Statistical analyses
We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate 
adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
expressing the relation between mode of delivery and composite 
outcomes. The final models controlled for maternal age, parity, 
birth weight, previous cesarean delivery, maternal province of resi-
dence and year of birth. We examined modification of the effect of 
mode of delivery on composite perinatal and maternal morbidity 
and mortality by fiscal year, provider type (obstetrician/nonobstetri-
cian), success or failure of operative vaginal delivery attempt and 
institutional delivery volume (high, medium or low) by introducing 
interaction terms into a mixed-effects regression model with a logit 
link function that accounted for clustered observations within insti-
tutions. We quantified the size of absolute effects by calculating 
adjusted rate differences and adjusted number needed to treat 
(NNT). Adjusted NNT reflects the average number of operative vagi-
nal deliveries that would have had to be delivered by cesarean to 
avoid 1 case of the outcome of interest
We conducted sensitivity analyses by estimating the 
association between attempted mode of delivery and composite 
perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality, assuming that 
all sequential instrument applications involved a failed vacuum 
delivery attempt followed by an attempted forceps delivery. All 
statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4. 
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Board of 
the University of British Columbia.

110 479 for fetal distress (Figure 1). Of these, 28 923 deliveries 
occurred after a prolonged second stage of labour (17 484 with 
dystocia and 11 439 with fetal distress). Nulliparous women, 
older women (≥ 35 yr) and those who deliv-
ered at later gestational ages were more 
likely to have had a cesarean delivery. Mid-
pelvic forceps delivery was more commonly 
used in nulliparous women than midpelvic 
vacuum, whereas the reverse was true 
among parous women (Table 1). Operative 
vaginal delivery was more common in insti-
tutions with high delivery volumes, 
whereas cesarean delivery was more fre-
quent in centres with low delivery volumes 
(Appendix 1, Supplementary Table 2).

Perinatal outcomes for deliveries with 
dystocia
Midpelvic operative vaginal delivery was 
associated with higher rates of composite 
severe perinatal morbidity and mortality 
compared with cesarean delivery (forceps: 
AOR 1.81, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.64; NNT 188, 
95% CI 93 to 635; vacuum: AOR 1.81, 95% CI 
1.17 to 2.80; NNT 188, 95% CI 85 to 897; 
sequential instrumentation: AOR 3.19, 
95% CI 1.73 to 5.88; NNT 70, 95% CI 31 to 
209; Table 2). Although forceps delivery and 
vacuum delivery had simliar rates of severe 
birth trauma (forceps: AOR 5.01, 95% CI 2.75 
to 9.15; NNT 145, 95% CI 71 to 332; and vac-
uum: AOR 4.47, 95% CI 2.27 to 8.80; NNT 168, 
95% CI 75 to 458, respectively), the rate was 
higher with sequential instrumentation 
(AOR 9.46, 95% CI 4.11 to 21.8; NNT 69, 
95% CI 28 to 187). Midpelvic forceps delivery 
was also associated with significantly higher 
rates of respiratory distress, severe cerebral 
morbidity and bacterial sepsis. 
Midpelvic vacuum delivery was associ-
ated with significantly higher rates of birth 
asphyxia, intracranial hemorrhage due to 
hypoxia and meconium aspiration syn-
drome. Delivery by sequential instrumenta-
tion was associated with higher rates of 
respiratory distress, cardiac failure or dys-
rhythmia and severe cerebral morbidity 
(Table 2). Birth trauma rates were signifi-
cantly higher in all midpelvic operative vag-
inal delivery groups compared with cesar-
ean delivery (Table 2 and Appendix 1 
[Supplementary Table 3]).

vaginal delivery compared with cesarean delivery (Table 2). How-
ever, midpelvic forceps delivery was associated with significantly 
higher rates of severe postpartum hemorrhage (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 
1.09 to 2.09) and significantly lower rates of cardiac complica-
tions (AOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.86) and postpartum infection 
(AOR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.79). Midpelvic vacuum delivery was 
associated with higher rates of postpartum hemorrhage 
(AOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.86) and lower rates of postpartum 
infection (AOR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.95).
Obstetric trauma rates were significantly higher after opera-
tive vaginal delivery (forceps: AOR 4.51, 95% CI 4.04 to 5.02; 
NNT 4, 95% CI 4 to 5; vacuum: AOR 2.70, 95% CI 2.35 to 3.09; NNT 9, 
95% CI 8 to 12; sequential instrumentation: AOR 4.24, 95% CI 3.46 
to 5.19; NNT 5, 95% CI 4 to 6). Rates of third- and fourth-degree peri-
neal lacerations were high (about 19% after midpelvic forceps, 12% 
after midpelvic vacuum and 20% after sequential instrumentation). 
Extension of the uterine incision occurred in 2.9% of cesarean deliv-
eries (Table 2 and Appendix 1 [Supplementary Table 3]).
Perinatal outcomes for deliveries with fetal distress
Rates of composite severe perinatal morbidity and mortality were 
higher among women with fetal distress compared with women 
who had dystocia (Table 3). Deliveries by sequential midpelvic 
instrumentation were associated with higher rates of composite 
severe perinatal morbidity and mortality than cesarean delivery 
(AOR 2.62, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.06; NNT 34, 95% CI 18 to 371). Rates of 
assisted ventilation by endotracheal intubation were lower after 
midpelvic forceps delivery (AOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.98) and 
midpelvic vacuum delivery (AOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.76). 
Severe birth trauma was substantially higher after all types of 
operative vaginal delivery (forceps: AOR 10.4, 95% CI 4.84 to 22.5; 
NNT 68, 30–166; vacuum: AOR 9.05, 95% CI 3.97 to 20.6; NNT 79, 
95% CI 33 to 215; sequential instrumentation: AOR 24.3, 95% CI 
9.72 to 60.8; NNT 27, 95% CI 11 to 73; Table 3). Midpelvic forceps 
deliveries were associated with lower rates of fetal asphyxia 
(AOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to–0.91) and higher rates of cardiac failure 
or dysrhythmia (AOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.90).
Maternal outcomes for deliveries with fetal distress
Composite severe maternal morbidity and mortality in deliveries 
with fetal distress was lower for the midpelvic vacuum group 
than for cesarean delivery (AOR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.80; 
NNT –96, 95% CI –229 to –68 ; Table 3). Midpelvic operative vagi-
nal deliveries were associated with significantly higher rates of 
obstetric trauma (forceps: AOR 3.34, 95% CI 2.94 to 3.80; NNT 5, 
95% CI 4 to 6; vacuum: AOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.33; NNT 12, 
95% CI 9 to 17; sequential instrumentation: AOR 3.23, 95% CI 2.55 
to 4.08; NNT 6, 95% CI 4 to 8), as well as higher rates of postpartum 
hemorrhage and lower rates of postpartum infection than for 
cesarean delivery. Rates of severe perineal laceration after opera-
tive vaginal delivery were high, ranging from 13% to 18%, depend-
ing on instrument(s) applied (Appendix 1, Supplementary Table 3).
Modifiers of the effect of mode of delivery
Effect of mode of delivery on composite severe perinatal and mater-
nal morbidity and mortality was not modified by institutional deliv-
ery volume, type of practitioner, success of the instrumentation or 
the inclusion of sequential instrumentation in the attempted midpel-
vic vacuum delivery group (Appendix 1, Supplementary Tables 4–7).
Operative vaginal versus cesarean delivery among 
women without a prolonged second stage of labour
Outcomes for deliveries with dystocia
Among women with dystocia and without prolonged second 
stage of labour, associations between midpelvic operative vagi-
nal delivery and composite severe perinatal morbidity and mor-
tality were significantly stronger (forceps: AOR 3.57, 95% CI 2.72 
to 4.69; vacuum: AOR 3.83, 95% CI 2.83 to 5.18; sequential instru-
mentation: AOR 4.89, 95% CI 3.00 to 7.99) than the same associa-
tions among women with a prolonged second stage of  labour 
(p values of 0.004, 0.004 and 0.3 for differences in AORs between 
women with and without a prolonged second stage of labour by 
forceps, vacuum and sequential instrumentation, respectively; 
Figure 2 and Appendix 1 [Supplementary Table 8]). 
There was no significant difference in the association between 
midpelvic instrumentation and composite maternal morbidity and 
mortality between women with and without a prolonged second 
stage of labour (p values of 0.9, 0.4 and 0.9 for differences in AORs 
between women with and without a prolonged second stage of 
labour delivered by forceps, vacuum and sequential instrumentation, 
respectively; Figure 2). The associations between midpelvic operative 
vaginal delivery and severe birth trauma and obstetric trauma after 
operative vaginal delivery were significantly stronger among women 
without a prolonged second stage of labour (Figure 2).
Outcomes for deliveries with fetal distress
Among women with deliveries involving fetal distress, the associa-
tion between midpelvic operative vaginal delivery and composite 
severe perinatal morbidity and mortality was similar among 
women with and without a prolonged second stage of labour. 
However, the associations between midpelvic forceps and sequen-
tial instrumentation deliveries and composite severe maternal 
morbidity and mortality were significantly stronger among women 
without a prolonged second stage (p values for differences in AORs 
were 0.007 and 0.04, respectively; Figure 2). Associations between 
operative vaginal delivery and obstetric trauma were significantly 
stronger in deliveries without a prolonged second stage compared 
with those with a prolonged second stage of labour (Figure 2).
Interpretation
Our study showed that rates of severe perinatal morbidity and mor-
tality were higher after cesarean delivery among deliveries with dys-
tocia, whereas rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality were 
similar. Among deliveries with fetal distress, rates of severe perinatal 
morbidity and mortality were higher after attempted midpelvic 
sequential instrumentation than for cesarean delivery, whereas rates 
of severe maternal morbidity and mortality were lower after 
attempted midpelvic vacuum delivery. This difference by indication 
appears to reflect the greater fetal jeopardy associated with fetal dis-
tress and the consequent higher baseline rate of adverse outcomes

even in the cesarean delivery group. Attempted midpelvic operative 
vaginal delivery was associated with substantially higher rates of 
severe birth trauma and obstetric trauma than cesarean delivery.
In contrast to the conflicting results in the existing litera-
ture,10,13–15 our study showed higher rates of neurologic injury fol-
lowing midpelvic operative delivery with forceps and sequential 
instrumentation. Reasons for this difference likely include limited 
power and lack of adjustment in previous studies10,13 and consider-
ations related to pelvic station and indication for delivery. Existing 
literature also does not provide clarity regarding blood loss after 
midpelvic operative vaginal delivery.7,8,15,21–23 Our study showed 
higher rates of postpartum hemorrhage after attempted midpelvic 
forceps delivery and attempted sequential instrumentation deliv-
eries compared with cesarean delivery. Although uterine atony 
appeared to contribute the most, increased rates of hemorrhage 
likely also reflect perineal and vaginal trauma.24

cause for concern. Rates ranging from 14% to 45% have been reported 
previously but are discounted because they reflect obstetric practice 
in the late 20th century.8,9,17 Nevertheless, recent studies continue to 
show high rates,25 and operative vaginal delivery is known to increase 
the risk of disorders of the pelvic floor 5–10 years after a first delivery.26 
Women should be informed about the substantially increased risk of 
trauma to the anal sphincter after midpelvic instrumental delivery and 
the relevant long-term implications for quality of life.
Limitations
Limitations of our study include our inability to account for the skill 
of the operator. However, women delivering in hospital have little 
understanding of the relevant issues about expertise in midpelvic 
operative vaginal delivery, and our data reflect the experience and 
skills of contemporary practitioners. Although we excluded women 
with common pregnancy complications, some uncommon compli-
cations may have been overrepresented in the cesarean delivery 
group. Such confounding by indication would have resulted in a bias 
favouring operative vaginal delivery. Finally, errors and omissions in 
coding are inevitable in large administrative databases; however, 
these would have resulted in nondifferential misclassification.
Conclusion
Our study showed that attempted midpelvic operative vaginal 
delivery is associated with substantially higher rates of severe birth 
trauma and obstetric trauma. Rates of severe perinatal and mater-
nal morbidity and mortality after midpelvic operative vaginal deliv-
ery were also increased, although these associations varied by indi-
cation and instrument used. Encouraging higher rates of operative 
vaginal delivery as a strategy to reduce the rate of cesarean delivery 
could result in increases in severe perinatal and maternal morbidity 
and mortality, especially birth trauma, severe postpartum hemor-
rhage and obstetric trauma.
