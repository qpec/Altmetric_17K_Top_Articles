AbsTrACT
The majority of the world’s population lives in urban 
areas, and regions with the highest under-five mortality 
rates are urbanising rapidly. This 7-year interrupted time 
series study measured early access to care and under-five 
mortality over the course of a proactive community case 
management (ProCCM) intervention in periurban Mali. 
Using a cluster-based, population-weighted sampling 
methodology, we conducted independent cross-sectional 
household surveys at baseline and at 12, 24, 36, 48, 
60, 72 and 84 months later in the intervention area. The 
ProCCM intervention had five key components: (1) active 
case detection by community health workers (CHWs), (2) 
CHW doorstep care, (3) monthly dedicated supervision 
for CHWs, (4) removal of user fees and (5) primary care 
infrastructure improvements and staff capacity building. 
Under-five mortality rate was calculated using a Cox 
proportional hazard survival regression. We measured 
the percentage of children initiating effective antimalarial 
treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset and the 
percentage of children reported to be febrile within the 
previous 2 weeks. During the intervention, the rate of early 
effective antimalarial treatment of children 0–59 months 
more than doubled, from 14.7% in 2008 to 35.3% in 2015 
(OR 3.198, P<0.0001). The prevalence of febrile illness 
among children under 5 years declined after 7 years of 
the intervention from 39.7% at baseline to 22.6% in 2015 
(OR 0.448, P<0.0001). Communities where ProCCM was 
implemented have achieved an under-five mortality rate 
at or below 28/1000 for the past 6 years. In 2015, under-
five mortality was 7/1000 (HR 0.039, P<0.0001). Further 
research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of action 
and generalizability of ProCCM.
InTroduCTIon
The majority of the world’s population now 
lives in urban areas.1 While Africa remains 
predominantly rural, the continent is urban-
ising faster than other regions and is projected 
to become 56% urban by 2050.1 With more 
than half of sub-Saharan Africa’s urban popu-
lation living in slums and informal settle-
ments,2 this demographic shift has major 
implications for health and health equity. 
Characterised by extreme poverty, environ-
mental degradation and a lack of basic infra-
structure, these urban areas are vulnerable to 
infectious diseases such as malaria, diarrhoea 
and pneumonia, to new pandemic outbreaks 
and to an emerging non-communicable 
disease burden.
Malaria, 
diarrhoea, 
pneumonia 
and 
neonatal illness, diseases with evidence-based 
and cost-effective prevention and treatment 
methods,3–5 constitute the leading causes 
of childhood death in sub-Saharan Africa.6 
Timely access to care is a key element in the 
management of these diseases, which prog-
ress rapidly. Delayed access to effective care 
has been correlated with increased under-five 
Summary box
What is already known about this topic?
 
► Countries with a high burden of under-five mortality 
are urbanising rapidly.
 
► Community health workers (CHWs) are being de-
ployed across countries in sub-Saharan Africa to 
reduce under-five mortality through integrated com-
munity case management (iCCM), predominantly in 
rural contexts.
 
► National efforts to deploy CHWs have confronted 
significant challenges, and the expected benefits of 
iCCM have not been found in all contexts.
What are the new findings?
 
► Seven years following the launch of proactive com-
munity case management (ProCCM), the areas of 
the intervention had an under-five mortality rate of 
7/1000.
 
► Communities served by ProCCM have sustained a 
rate of under-five mortality lower than any country 
in sub-Saharan Africa.
recommendations for policy
 
► Facing rapid urbanisation, health systems will need 
to overcome multiple barriers urban patients face to 
accessing timely care in order to stop preventable 
child deaths.
 
► Further research is urgently needed on the core 
strategies of ProCCM to determine their generaliz-
ability and mechanisms of action in improving child 
mortality.

ratory infection10 11 and neonatal asphyxia.12–14
Weak and poorly designed health systems create 
barriers to timely access to care.14 15 Fees at point of 
care are associated with decreased and delayed utili-
sation of care, and removing user fees correlates with 
increases in healthcare utilisation, particularly among 
the poor.16–20 Inadequate human resources for health, 
gender inequality, inadequate infrastructure and poverty 
also impede access to care.14 21–26 Geographical distance, 
though a more prominent barrier in rural contexts, 
can still impede access to care for the urban poor.21 As 
a result, facility-based services alone, in both rural and 
urban contexts, frequently do not provide adequate, 
timely and equitable access to care.27
Community case management (CCM) removes barriers 
to access by training and supporting community health 
workers (CHWs) to diagnose, treat and refer sick chil-
dren in the communities in which they live. Since 2004, 
WHO and Unicef have issued joint statements promoting 
CCM of malaria, acute diarrhoea, pneumonia, acute 
malnutrition and newborn survival. These statements are 
based on a body of evidence showing CCM to be effective 
in increasing care seeking, reducing treatment failure 
rates and reducing mortality due to malaria, diarrhoea, 
pneumonia and all-cause mortality.28–36 In 2012, these 
community-based services were compiled into a package 
of care known as integrated community case manage-
ment (iCCM) of childhood illnesses.27
Twenty-eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa have 
adopted iCCM as a strategy to improve child health 
and survival.37 iCCM programmes differ in many ways, 
including CHW workflow, recruitment, training, health 
systems integration, supervision and compensation.37–39 
However, one particular pattern emerges among iCCM 
policies and plans in sub-Saharan Africa. In Mali, Liberia, 
Ghana, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Malawi and other coun-
tries, iCCM has been used as a strategy to improve child 
health primarily in remote rural settings. As the sub-Sa-
haran African region urbanises rapidly, further research 
is needed urgently on the feasibility and effects of iCCM 
on improving access to care, morbidity and mortality in 
urban areas.
National efforts to scale iCCM have confronted signif-
icant challenges, and the expected benefits of iCCM 
have not been found in all contexts.40–42 Three recent 
independent evaluations of national iCCM programmes 
in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Malawi found no signifi-
cant impact on care seeking or child mortality.43–46 These 
results emphasise the importance of testing models for 
improving iCCM service delivery and the potential impact 
of improved models in both urban and rural contexts.
Geographical proximity to a health centre does not 
ensure access to services, as many health system barriers, 
including direct and indirect costs of care, availability of 
services, shortage and insufficient training of staff and 
gender inequality, persist in urban contexts.47 48 CHWs do 
more than extend the health system into geographically 
remote areas; they may be important for overcoming 
barriers to care that cut across rural–urban divides.
However, research and programmatic effort for iCCM 
and CHW services have been considerably more limited 
in urban settings than in rural communities. CHWs have 
been shown to improve rates of exclusive breastfeeding, 
infant weight and care seeking through prenatal and 
postnatal home visits in a periurban settlement in South 
Africa.49 50 The BRAC Manoshi programme significantly 
reduced home births, maternal mortality and neonatal 
mortality through CHW home visits in urban slums in 
Bangladesh.51 Pilot projects in five African cities suggest 
that CCM of malaria is relevant in urban settings, where 
community-based agents were often the first point of 
care for febrile children, and most children were treated 
within 24 hours of symptom onset.52 53
As Mali expands iCCM to remote rural villages, the 
government and its partners have expressed interest in 
testing alternative models of iCCM delivery and its poten-
tial impact in urban areas. Proactive community case 
management (ProCCM), a model for integrating iCCM 
into health systems at scale, is being implemented and 
tested in periurban and rural Mali. ProCCM takes into 
account the multiplicity of barriers patients face when 
trying to obtain care, focusing on early access. ProCCM 
CHWs conduct daily door-to-door proactive case detec-
tion, searching for and identifying patients who need 
care. For all patients identified, CHWs provide free-of-
charge doorstep evaluation, diagnostics, treatment, 
referral, counselling and follow-up.
In 2013, an interrupted time series study documented 
changes in early access to care and under-five mortality in 
the periurban area of Yirimadio, Mali after the roll-out of 
a health system strengthening intervention that included 
ProCCM of malaria. Three years after the introduction 
of the intervention, early access to care increased nearly 
twofold (PR=1.89, P=0.0195), and the total number of 
patient–provider contacts increased 10-fold. Under-five 
mortality was 155 per 1000 live births at baseline and 17 
per 1000 live births at year three (HR 0.10, P<0.0001).54
In Mali and across sub-Saharan Africa, iCCM is being 
designed for and implemented primarily in remote rural 
settings with mixed results. Testing alternative models of 
delivery of iCCM services and their potential impact in 
both rural and urban contexts is, therefore, important. 
Here, we present a 7-year follow-on interrupted time series 
analysis assessing whether the changes in access to care 
and child mortality seen in ProCCM communities have 
been sustained over time.

the periurban area of Yirimadio has experienced rapid 
population growth. Based on household census enumer-
ations by Muso, the population in the study area was 
56 371 in 2011 and 77 132 in 2013. Several factors contrib-
uted to the rapid population growth of the area. These 
include in-migration from rural areas, out-migration 
from the city’s centre and Mali’s high fertility rate—
factors consistent with trends of urban growth across the 
region.57 Certain patients also reported that they had 
moved to the area to seek care in the context of a system 
that provided access to healthcare without fees. During 
the 2012 security crisis in Mali, residents from Mali’s 
north were displaced and sought refuge in the country’s 
south, including the areas of the study.
At baseline, the public sector provided primary care 
through a community health centre that consisted of a 
consultation room, medicine dispensary, observation 
room and two rooms for labour and delivery. Local volun-
teers, known as relais, were trained by the Ministry of 
Health to share key maternal and child health messages 
with other community members. At baseline, there were 
no CHWs providing community-based management of 
childhood illness.
desCrIpTIon of THe proCCM InTervenTIon
The non-governmental organisation Muso58 and the 
Malian Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene jointly 
launched ProCCM in Yirimadio in September 2008, 
designed to overcome health system barriers to timely 
access to preventive and curative care.
ProCCM involved five key components: (1) proactive 
case detection: CHWs conducted proactive case detec-
tion, searching for patients door-to-door for at least 
2 hours per day, 6 days per week; (2) doorstep care: CHWs 
provided counselling, diagnosis, treatment and referral 
according to standard iCCM protocols27; (3) dedicated 
supervision: CHWs received monthly individual super-
vision sessions and weekly group supervision sessions 
from a dedicated CHW supervisor; (4) user fee removal: 
no user fees were charged for community-based care. 
User fees were also removed at the Ministry of Health 
primary care centre for all patients who could not afford 
to pay, as determined by the patient self-reporting to his 
or her CHW and (5) primary care centre improvements: 
primary care capacity building for the Ministry of Health 
primary care centre, through infrastructure expansion 
and staff training.
Proactive CHWs providing doorstep care, removal of 
user fees and health centre construction were all fully 
deployed by September 2008. In the context of rapid 
population growth, the number of CHWs increased to 
target a CHW: population ratio of 1:1000, from 20 CHWs 
in 2008 to 75 in 2013 and then to 150 in 2015, of which 
95% were women. Group supervision visits occurred 
weekly, held by a supervising programme manager from 
2008 to 2013 and then by a dedicated cadre of CHW 
supervisors from 2013 to 2015. Individual monthly field 
supervision visits from a dedicated cadre of CHW super-
visors began in July 2013. To keep up with population 
growth, additional health centre construction further 
expanded the public sector primary health centre in 
2009, 2010 and 2013.
CHWs received 36 days of foundational training. The 
first CHWs deployed in 2008 received approximately half 
of this training preservice and the rest in modular fashion 
as in-service training. For CHWs subsequently recruited, 
most of this training was shifted to be preservice, with 
weekly group supervision meetings serving to review 
and reinforce key skills and competencies. CHWs were 
instructed and supervised to conduct at least 2 hours of 
proactive case detection home visits per day, 6 days per 
week, with a goal of visiting each household at least twice 
per month. CHWs maintained the autonomy to deter-
mine the details of their own workflow, including what 
times of day they conducted their visits and what order 
or pattern they visited homes. This high level of CHW 
autonomy was by design, positioning the CHWs as leaders 
in assessing the needs of their communities, adapting to 
local context, triaging urgent cases and adjusting their 
workflows to meet their goals.
Outside their proactive case detection activities, 
CHWs were instructed to be available on call at all 
times to patients who sought their services. In addi-
tion to proactive case detection for patients of all 
ages, CHWs provided a package of services consistent 
with iCCM clinical protocols, including: (1) counsel-
ling; (2) diagnosis of malaria (all ages), pneumonia, 
diarrhoeal disease and malnutrition for children 
under five; (3) treatment of uncomplicated cases of 
malaria, pneumonia, diarrhoeal disease and moderate 
acute malnutrition for children under five; (4) referral 
and accompaniment of patients with danger signs or 
conditions outside the CHW’s scope of practice to the 
primary health centre—this included identification 
and evacuation of patients with danger signs in the 
neonatal period, such as lethargy and poor feeding; 
(5) follow-up visits to support adherence and monitor 
response to therapy at 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours 
for all sick patients after the initial evaluation, with an 
additional visit after 5 days for patients with diarrhoeal 
disease and (6) active case detection and evacuation 
of sick newborns, pregnant women and postpartum 
women to the primary care facility for treatment.
CHWs were recruited from the area of the intervention. 
Selection criteria included an ability to read and write in 
the local language (Bamanankan), communication skills, 
a commitment to community health, work ethic and an 
age between 18 and 45 years old. Female candidates 
were encouraged to apply. For neighbourhoods without 
a qualified candidate, the nearest qualified candidate 
was selected. CHWs were compensated for their work 
with a monthly payment of FCFA40 000 (approximately 
US$75). Each CHW supervisor was paid a starting salary 
of FCFA100 000 (approximately US$188) per month and 
was responsible for 15–20 CHWs.

ConCurrenT InTervenTIons In THe sTudy AreA
During the period of the study, other interventions were 
introduced in the study area that sought to address 
disparities in the socioeconomic determinants of health, 
through microenterprise support, education and commu-
nity organising. A non-formal education programme, 
developed by the organisation Tostan,59 trained 1032 
adults and adolescents in the years 2009–2012 with a 
curriculum that included human rights, problem solving, 
project management, democracy, health, hygiene, 
literacy, numeracy and income generation skills. Also, 
during the period of 2009–2012, 238 community organ-
isers were trained to identify and implement communi-
ty-designed health and development projects, including 
planting trees and mobilising community members 
around vaccination campaigns. From 2008 to 2015, a 
Muso microenterprise programme with 477 participants 
provided training, savings structures, grants and/or loans 
to women to start or expand revenue-generating activi-
ties.
In addition, during the period of the study, the Malian 
Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene adopted a national 
strategy targeting universal coverage with long-lasting 
insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) for malaria prevention. 
Distribution campaigns of LLINs were undertaken by 
Muso, Population Services International (PSI) and the 
Malian Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene in the 
study area in 2011 and 2015.
pArTICIpAnTs And sAMplIng MeTHodology
We conducted an adequacy evaluation based on a full 
coverage intervention to measure changes in early access 
and under-five mortality outcomes in the surveyed area.60 
Starting in 2008, we conducted independent, cross-sec-
tional household surveys in the intervention area at base-
line and at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 84 months subse-
quently. The surveys were conducted in the months of 
June and July each year. We included households with an 
adult woman. We randomly sampled 400 households in 
2008, 2009 and 2010, 1170 households in 2011 and 1200 
households in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. We initially 
powered the sample to estimate the percentage of chil-
dren aged 0–59 months with a fever in the 2 weeks prior 
to the survey who received an effective antimalarial within 
24 hours of symptom onset, in a population of 56 000, 
with a 95% confidence level, a 5% margin of error and a 
conservative 50% response distribution.
A two-stage cluster sampling methodology, with prob-
ability of selection proportional to population size, was 
used to achieve a representative sample of the population 
in the intervention area. In the first stage of sampling, 
we generated 40 (2008–2010) or 65 (2011–2015) random 
non-overlapping latitude–longitude coordinates with 
100 m radial buffers within the area of the interven-
tion. As a measure of population density, we counted 
the number of structures within each cluster, using less 
than 6-month-old satellite imagery. In the second stage of 
sampling, interviewers selected households by arriving at 
the centre of the cluster and spinning a pen to identify 
a random direction to determine the initial direction to 
follow. They then visited every second household along 
that trajectory and chose a predetermined number of 
households proportional to the population density in 
that cluster. Within each household, a Kish grid61 for 
random participant selection was used to randomly select 
one respondent, a female aged 16 years or over. In accor-
dance with Malian law, married women younger than age 
16 were also considered adults and included in the survey. 
The survey, which included questions about household 
demographic characteristics, fever in children under five 
and birth histories, was adapted primarily from Mali’s 
national Demographic and Health Survey, using existing 
validated tools created by ICF International and PSI.62 
Interviewers were hired for the sole purpose of survey 
administration and were not members of the communi-
ties they surveyed.
Demographic characteristics of respondents were 
similar across study years (online supplementary table 
1A, B).
pATIenT vIsITs And progrAMMe ouTpuTs
Patient data were collected through patient encounter 
forms completed by the government primary health 
centre staff and CHWs. A data entry professional based 
at the government primary healthcare centre main-
tained an electronic database that tracked the number 
of patient encounters in which user fees were removed. 
The number of sick patient visits per month was tracked 
by primary health centre staff and made available by the 
Ministry of Health District Health Information Systems 
office. At each patient encounter, CHWs recorded when 
the encounter began and when symptom onset began, 
from which we calculated the symptom-to-care time and 
the percentage of CHW patients aged 0–59 months who 
received care within 24 hours of symptom onset. This 
clinical data collected for programmatic outputs comple-
mented data collected separately on symptom-to-treat-
ment time in the household survey.
In the years after the roll-out of ProCCM, documented 
patient visits in the home or the clinic increased 10-fold. 
During the period of the intervention, CHWs conducted 
618 877 proactive case finding home visits, and 29 561 
home visits for sick children 0–59 months old. In the 
2015 survey, 77% of participants reported that they had 
received a home visit from a CHW within the past 3 years. 
Of those who reported receiving CHW home visits in 
that survey, 59% had been visited within the past month, 
and 77% had been visited within the past 3 months. The 
Yirimadio public community health centre conducted 
231 873 sick patient visits and follow-ups for patients of all 
ages, of which 106 050 (46%) had all user fees removed 
(figure 1).

first for danger signs, indicating need for emergently

evacuating the patient to the primary care centre, and 
referral signs, indicating the need to refer the patient to 
the primary care centre because of a condition beyond 
the CHW’s scope of practice. Of patients evaluated by 
CHWs aged 0–59 months, 28% had a danger or referral 
sign requiring treatment at the primary care facility, and 
17% had a positive malaria rapid antigen diagnostic test. 
Test positivity ranged from a low of 6% in the dry season 
months (February to June) to a peak of 42% in the rainy 
season months (October and November). Neither the 
design of the survey tool nor the data quality from the 
primary care facility permits a breakdown of morbidity 
or mortality by cause among patients treated. The 
percentage of CHW patients aged 0–59 months reached 
within 24 hours of symptom onset was 25% in year 1 and 
62% in year 7 (online supplementary figure 1).
The intervention costed approximately US$8 per 
person served per year (ranging from approximately 
US$6 to US$13 per person per year). As the intervention 
provided care to patients of all ages, aimed at full popula-
tion coverage, cost per person was calculated by dividing 
total intervention costs by the estimated total population 
of the catchment area. This cost, when added to Mali’s 
existing government spending on healthcare, would 
still be well within the range of what governments in the 
region are spending on healthcare, and consistent with 
Abuja Declaration targets.63 A detailed study of interven-
tion costing and cost-effectiveness is currently in process.
febrIle Illness And eArly TreATMenT InITIATIon
We calculated the proportion of children in the house-
hold under five (both biological and non-biological chil-
dren of respondents) who were reported to be febrile 
in the 2 weeks prior to the survey and the proportion 
of febrile children under five who received an effective 
antimalarial treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset. 
We estimated prevalence using SAS (v9.4) accounting 
for clustering and strata with surveyfreq command. 
The Surveylogistic command was used to predict and 
compare the prevalence and/or ORs for the covariates 
in each logistic regression model, adjusted for clustering 
and sampling weight. The ‘study year’ (2008 to 2015) was 
treated as a categorical variable with 2008 as the refer-
ence year. Two other covariates, ‘having nets in house-
hold’ and ‘having attended any school,’ were included 
in the models when appropriate and/or significant to 
adjust the logistic models. The model fit the data well, 
and the convergence criteria were satisfied.
The prevalence of febrile illness among children under 
5 years in the 2 weeks prior to the survey decreased signifi-
cantly from 39.7% in 2008 to 22.6% in 2015 (OR 0.448, 
P<0.0001, table 1), a relative reduction of 55.2%. The 
lowest prevalence was observed in 2014 (15.7%), a rela-
tive reduction of 71.5% from 2008 (OR 0.285, P=0.0002, 
table 1).

24 hours of symptom onset more than doubled during 
the study period, from 14.7% in 2008 to 35.3% in 2015 
(OR 3.198, P<0.0001, table 2). The percentage who 
received early antimalarial treatment peaked in 2014 
at 65.1%, with the odds of early treatment almost 11 
times the odds in 2008 (OR 10.842, P<0.0001). During 
the same period, national rates of early effective anti-
malarial treatment remained flat and low: 15% in 2006 
and 15% in 2012–2013 Demographic and Health Survey 
studies.64 This is consistent with low rates of access to arte-
misinin-based combination therapy across sub-Saharan 
Africa.65
The respondent’s education status was significantly 
associated with effective early treatment of febrile illness 
among children under 5 years. Effective antimalarial 
treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset increased by 
49% if the female respondent had attended any school 
compared with no school (OR 1.49, P<0.01). However, 
education status was not significant in the model when 
the interaction terms were included, and thus, the model 
with year only was used to estimate all ORs (table 2).
An important limitation to note is that the primary indi-
cator of early effective antimalarial treatment measured 
treatment rates among all children with fever in 2 weeks 
prior to the survey rather than among all children with 
test-confirmed malaria. This was due to a lack of high-
quality data on malaria diagnostic use for the full dura-
tion of the study.
A 55% relative decrease occurred in the percentage 
of children 0–59 months with all-cause febrile illness. 
The documented increases in early treatment across 
the population likely shortened infection duration and 
may have reduced transmission of malaria, pneumonia 
and diarrhoeal disease. Treating cases of malaria within 
24 hours of symptom onset, for example, could have 
eradicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria infections 
before the transmissible gametocyte form emerged.66 67 
In Senegal, weekly proactive case detection was associ-
ated with a significant reduction in the odds of symptom-
atic malaria infection.68

Under-five mortality rates for all births reported by 
respondents in the 5 years prior to each survey were 
computed and compared. We used a Cox proportional 
hazard survival regression to compare risk of death 
before the age of 5 years across surveys, using survey year 
(2008 to 2015) as the explanatory variable and the 2008 
survey as the reference.
The multiple imputation procedures MI and MIAN-
ALYZE in SAS, based on stochastic regression and 
maximum likelihood methods for the fully conditional 
specification, were used to estimate missing values for age 
of death (in months), month of death and year of death. 
After multiple imputation of missing values, the partic-
ipation time of each child under 5 years within a year 
was estimated for the Cox proportional hazard survival 
regression. We accounted for clustering of observations 
by sampling survey area. Children under five still alive 
at the time of survey were right censored. All the criteria 
were met for the proportional hazard model, and the 
results were analysed using the multiply imputed datasets.
In online supplementary table 2, we present the 
missing patterns of the dataset with the percentage of 
complete or incomplete information for each variable 
to be imputed. The minimum relative efficiency of the 
imputed dataset was 0.999985, meaning that 99.9985% 
of the true parameter values were estimated for the vari-
ables. Also, the maximum value of the fraction missing 
info (FMI) for the variables was 0.000763, meaning only 
0.076% of sampling variance is attributable to missing 
data.
Figure 2 compares the rate of under-five mortality in 
the study area to national under-five mortality rates in 
Mali overall69 and in urban areas of Mali64 in particular. 
Under-five mortality rate was estimated at 154 deaths per 
1000 live births in 2008 before the ProCCM intervention 
and at 7 deaths per 1000 live births in 2015, 7 years after 
intervention launch (HR 0.039 p<0.0001, table 3). In 
each of the 6 years since 2010, the area of intervention 
maintained a rate of under-five mortality equal to or less

than 28/1000. During the same period, Mali’s estimated 
national under-five mortality rate was 148/1000 in 2008 
and at least 114/1000 through 2015 (United Nations 
Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation).55 69 
The under-five mortality rate in Mali’s 2012–2013 Demo-
graphic and Health Survey was 95/1000 (though this 
survey covered only southern Mali).64
These findings, while remarkable, are subject to several 
important limitations. First, this interrupted time series 
study design had no control group, and therefore, no 
causal inference can be made attributing the documented 
changes in health outcomes to the ProCCM intervention, 
to specific elements of ProCCM or to concurrent inter-
ventions addressing the social determinants of health. 
We cannot draw conclusions as to whether the differ-
ences in under-five mortality were due to demographic 
shifts, other national trends or other factors. The study 
did not collect information regarding household wealth, 
parasite prevalence or vaccination coverage. We cannot 
rule out the possibility that, in the context of rapid 
urbanisation, the population make-up in the study area 
changed in some systematic way that contributed to the 
study findings. However, the sociodemographic indi-
cators collected in the study remained similar over the 
study period, providing no indication of an overall demo-
graphic shift in the population.
The study only conducted one preintervention 
survey, leaving open the possibility that the baseline rate 
recorded was an abnormal year. However, that baseline 
rate is consistent with national and urban rates at the 
time. The study also involved only one periurban site, 
limiting the conclusions that can be made regarding the 
study’s generalizability.
The rate of decline in under-five mortality rate in the 
first survey years is faster than would be expected given 
that rates were based on all births in the 5 years prior to 
each survey. Four factors may have contributed here: (1) 
small sample size in the first three survey years resulted 
in wider  CIs with the possibility of an overestimate of the 
baseline rate or an underestimate of the rate in 2009 or 
2010; (2) as shown in figure 2, Mali’s under-five mortality 
rate was already declining during this period, and likely 
contributed an uneven distribution of child deaths across 
the study years, though given the recorded national 
changes in under-five mortality, the contribution of this 
factor was likely modest; (3) recall error could have led 
respondents to under-report deaths occurring more than 
a year prior to the survey or (4) demographic changes 
could have occurred in the study population that were not 
captured by the sociodemographic indicators measured 
in the survey.
The original sample size of 400 households of the 
first three surveys (2008 to 2010) was powered for the 
outcome of early treatment with an effective antimalarial. 
Although the sample size was not powered for under-
five mortality rate, we, nevertheless, observed significant 
differences in under-five child mortality in each year

over the 7-year follow-up with respect to baseline. The 
slight differences in under-five mortality rate for years 
2008 through 2011 reported here compared with the 
rates published in 2013 are attributable to the fact that 
all imputations were rerun for this follow-up analysis, and 
results differ slightly each time the multiple imputations 
procedure is run.
We tested whether bed net ownership was a significant 
confounder, using a Cox proportional hazard survival 
regression for under-five mortality rate, and found 
that bed net ownership changes in this study were not 
significant (P=0.88) in the model predicting under-five 
mortality rate.
Taking into account these important limitations, there 
is no strong evidence that confounders played a substan-
tial role in these dramatic results. In this context, roll-out 
of ProCCM is the most probable explanation for the find-
ings in this intervention.
Given that under-five mortality rates are driven by 
curable, time-sensitive illnesses, the documented increase 
in early access to care provides one possible explanation 
for sustained low rates of under-five mortality reported 
here. ProCCM is designed to remove financial, geograph-
ical, gender and infrastructural barriers that reduce 
and delay access to care and ultimately reduce under-
five mortality through two primary mechanisms. First, 
increased access to earlier effective treatment can directly 
reduce the likelihood of progression to severe illness and 
death. Through proactive case detection, in-home diag-
nosis and treatment and rapid evacuation of patients with 
danger signs to the primary care facility, CHWs aimed to 
ensure early treatment in the home or the clinic for the 
leading causes of under-five mortality: neonatal illness, 
malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea. While the study 
design does not permit an analysis of cause of death 
before and during the ProCCM intervention, it is reason-
able to hypothesise that rapid access to evidence-based 
treatment could have reduced mortality for all of these 
conditions, including neonatal illnesses responsible for 
36% of under-five deaths in Mali.64 Second, in the case of 
malaria, diarrhoeal disease and pneumonia, earlier treat-
ment can reduce the time period during which a patient 
can infect others.
ConClusIon
In 2015, the United Nations committed to the Sustain-
able Development Goals, which include each country 
achieving universal health coverage and attaining an 
under-five mortality rate of no more than 25/1000 by 
2030. As part of the efforts to achieve these goals in 
improving access to care and child survival, 28 countries 
in sub-Saharan Africa have deployed iCCM by CHWs.37 
While multiple studies have shown that this CHW-led 
strategy can reduce newborn and under-five mortality, 
efforts to scale up iCCM have been met with mixed results, 
raising questions about how CHWs can be deployed most 
effectively, particularly in rapidly growing urban areas.
After the roll-out of ProCCM, the areas studied here 
have sustained a rate of under-five mortality lower than 
that of any country in sub-Saharan Africa for the past 
6 years.
Amid rapid urbanisation throughout the region, health 
systems will need to overcome the multiplicity of barriers 
urban patients face to accessing timely care in order to 
stop preventable child deaths. Rapid population growth 
during the intervention also necessitated recruitment of 
additional CHWs, expansion of infrastructure capacity 
and annual adjustment of medication and supply needs.
Further research is urgently needed on ProCCM and 
its core strategies, to determine their respective role 
in improving morbidity and mortality. A randomised 
controlled trial of ProCCM’s proactive case detection 
approach is currently underway across 137 cluster sites, 
designed to address some of these limitations (
