Patients with Bone Metastases. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 50, No. 3, pp. 393–399, 2018. Purpose: The presence of bone metastases has excluded
participation of cancer patients in exercise interventions and is a relative contraindication to supervised exercise in the community setting because of
concerns of fragility fracture. We examined the efficacy and safety of a modular multimodal exercise program in prostate cancer patients with
bone metastases. Methods: Between 2012 and 2015, 57 prostate cancer patients (70.0 T 8.4 yr; body mass index, 28.7 T 4.0 kgImj2) with bone
metastases (pelvis, 75.4%; femur, 40.4%; rib/thoracic spine, 66.7%; lumbar spine, 43.9%; humerus, 24.6%; other sites, 70.2%) were randomized to
multimodal supervised aerobic, resistance, and flexibility exercises undertaken thrice weekly (EX; n = 28) or usual care (CON; n = 29) for 3 months.
Physical function subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 was the primary end point as an indicator of patient-rated physical
functioning. Secondary end points included objective measures of physical function, lower body muscle strength, body composition, and fatigue.
Safety was assessed by recording the incidence and severity of any adverse events, skeletal complications, and bone pain throughout the intervention.
Results: There was a significant difference between groups for self-reported physical functioning (3.2 points; 95% confidence interval, 0.4–6.0 points;
P = 0.028) and lower body muscle strength (6.6 kg; 95% confidence interval, 0.6–12.7; P = 0.033) at 3 months favoring EX. However, there
was no difference between groups for lean mass (P = 0.584), fat mass (P = 0.598), or fatigue (P = 0.964). There were no exercise-related
adverse events or skeletal fractures and no differences in bone pain between EX and CON (P = 0.507). Conclusions: Multimodal modular
exercise in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases led to self-reported improvements in physical function and objectively measured
lower body muscle strength with no skeletal complications or increased bone pain. Trial Registration: ACTRN12611001158954.

he clinical course of metastatic bone disease in
prostate cancer (PCa) patients is relatively long, with
a 5-yr survival rate of approximately 30% (1). Me-
tastases to bone occurs in approximately 80% of men with
advanced PCa (2), and most of these patients are at risk
for developing pathological fractures, hypercalcemia, bone
marrow suppression, and nerve compression or spinal cord
compression that results in significant morbidity, limited
function, and decreased quality of life (3–5). Consequently,
improving physical function and delaying or preventing
skeletal complication in patients with bone metastases can
provide clinically meaningful benefits to patients.
Over the past decade, numerous clinical trials investigat-
ing the efficacy of exercise in men with PCa, including our

 previous work, excluded patients with bone metastases (6–11),
or bone lesions deemed clinically ‘‘unstable’’ (12) because of
the potential risk of skeletal fractures, spinal compression, or
exacerbation of bone pain. Nevertheless, international exer-
cise oncology guidelines suggest that cancer patients, in-
cluding those with bone metastases, should avoid inactivity
(13,14). However, it is unknown if exercise is efficacious at
this stage of the disease and whether it can be tolerated by
this patient group given the current absence of clinical data
on exercise safety, tolerability, and efficacy (15).
In this clinical trial, we tested the efficacy and safety of
a modular multimodal exercise program (M3EP) comprising
resistance, aerobic, and flexibility training taking into con-
sideration the location and extent of bone metastases as
a strategy to maintain or enhance physical function in this
group of patients with advanced PCa. Consequently, the
program was based on a mechanical perspective to avoid
direct loading to the metastatic lesions. Change in the physical
function subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form
36 (SF-36) over 3 months served as the primary study end
point. Secondary end points included safety and objective
measures of physical function, muscle strength, body com-
position, and fatigue. We hypothesized that a short-term
modular multimodal exercise regimen would preserve physical
function in patients with bone metastases without increasing
skeletal complications.
METHODS
Patients. One hundred three patients with PCa were
referred by their oncologist or urologist in Perth, Western
Australia, from August 2012 to August 2015. Inclusion
criteria included established bone metastases according to
their most recent bone scan, and this included at any time
point of their bone metastatic disease (e.g., at onset of bone
metastatic diagnosis or at any time point thereafter), no
acute illness, and no significant bone pain as assessed by
their clinician. Exclusion criteria included the presence of
any musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, or neurological dis-
orders that could inhibit patients from exercising, and if
patients had undertaken structured and supervised aerobic
and/or resistance training two or more times per week
within the past 3 months (15). The study was approved by
the University Human Research Ethics Committee, and all
participants provided written informed consent.
Study design and random assignment. This was a
two-armed prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT)
(15). Potential patients were referred to the study coordina-
tor to confirm eligibility, describe the study, and obtain in-
formed consent. Patients underwent a familiarization session
followed by baseline testing comprising physical and func-
tional tests, a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, ques-
tionnaires, and a blood draw. After the baseline assessment,
patients were randomly assigned to exercise (EX) or usual
care controls (CON) in a ratio of 1/1 using a computer random
assignment program subject to maintaining approximate bal-
ance regarding stratification for current chemotherapy. The
allocation sequence was concealed from the project coordi-
nator and exercise physiologist involved in assigning patients
to groups. Patients in CON were asked not to change their
physical activity and were offered the same exercise program
after the 3-month control period.
Exercise training program. The M3EP comprised
resistance, aerobic, and flexibility exercises undertaken three
times per week in a university exercise clinic supervised by
an exercise physiologist and has been described in detail
elsewhere (15). In brief, the exercise prescription was based
on location/extent of bone metastases to avoid specific
loading of the sites (Table 1), with exercise sessions lasting
~60 min. The resistance exercise component targeted the
major trunk and upper and lower body muscle groups, which
we have used in previous studies (8,16,17), at a moderate
intensity ranging from 10- to 12-repetition maximum (RM;
e.g., maximal weight that can be lifted 10–12 times) for three
sets per exercise. Exercises were performed at a set cadence
of 2 s for both eccentric and concentric phases, minimizing
peak forces transmitted to the skeleton (18,19). To ensure
progression, resistance was increased by 5%–10% for the
next set/training session when the RM values were exceeded
during a set. The aerobic exercise component included 20–30 min
of cardiovascular exercise using various modes such as
walking on a treadmill, cycling, or rowing on a stationary
ergometer on the basis of disease extent with a target inten-
sity of 60%–85% estimated maximal heart rate. The flexi-
bility component involved static stretching, 2–4 repetitions
for 30–60 s per stretch for all major joints considered important

 for maintaining function (20). Each session commenced with
a 10-min warm-up comprising low-level aerobic activities such
as treadmill walking and stationary cycling as determined by
bone metastases site, as well as stretching, and concluded with a
5-min cool-down period of stretching activities.
Primary and secondary study end points. Study
end points were assessed at baseline and after the 12-wk
intervention. The primary study end point was the physical
function subscale from the SF-36 questionnaire (Table 2)
used as an indicator of patient-rated physical functioning
(21). Secondary end points included objective measures of
physical function assessed by the timed up-and-go test, 6-m
usual and fast walk using electronic timing gates, and the
400-m walk test (8,17). Tests were performed in triplicate
(except 400 m) with recovery time between trials. Dynamic
muscle strength was determined for the leg extension exer-
cise and the chest press exercise using the 1-RM method
(22). Patients with proximal femur bone lesions were ex-
cluded from the leg extension 1-RM and 400-m walk test,
whereas those with rib/thoracic spine lesions and humerus
lesions were excluded from the chest press 1-RM. Balance
was assessed by the sensory organization test (NeuroCom
International Inc, Clackamas, OR) (8). Whole-body lean
mass and fat mass were assessed by dual-energy x-ray ab-
sorptiometry (Hologic Discovery A, Waltham, MA). Fatigue
was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy—Fatigue questionnaire (23). Prostate-specific
antigen was measured commercially by a nationally accredited
laboratory (8).
Safety of the program. Safety of the exercise program
was assessed by recording the incidence and severity of any
adverse events, including skeletal complications, throughout
the intervention. Skeletal complications included pain at known
bone metastases sites and pathological skeletal fractures (24).
Bone pain was monitored according to the Common Termi-
nology Criteria of the National Cancer Institute: grade 1, mild,
not interfering with function; grade 2, moderate pain, inter-
fering with function but not interfering with the activities of
daily life; and grade 3, severe pain, severely interfering with
the activities of daily living. The Functional Assessment of
Cancer Therapy—Bone Pain was used to assess bone pain
(25). Tolerance of the exercise program was evaluated by
recording patients’ ratings of perceived exertion, with the
ratings of perceived exertion assessed at the end of each ses-
sion to represent the cumulative effect of the exercise session
(26). In addition, exercise tolerance was assessed before the
first exercise session each week using a 0- to 7-point scale,
with higher scores indicating greater tolerance. The number
of patients completing the intervention and sessions attended
was recorded.
Statistical analyses and sample size calculation. The
sample size estimate for the RCT was based on projected
changes in the primary outcome of self-reported physical
function from the SF-36. A priori, 36 subjects per group were
required to achieve 80% power at an alpha level of 0.05 (two-
tailed) to detect a 3-point difference between groups at the end
of the 3-month intervention. To account for projected dropout,
our goal was to recruit 90 patients in total. Data were analyzed
using IBM SPSS Version 24 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).
Normality of the distribution for outcome measures was tested
using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Between-group differ-
ences in baseline characteristics for continuous data were
assessed using independent t tests or the Mann–Whitney U test,
as appropriate, and chi-square test for categorical data. Anal-
ysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values was used to
assess the intervention effects on the primary and secondary
study end points. Tests were two-tailed with an alpha level of
0.05 applied as the criterion for statistical significance. Be-
cause of the variation in number of patients able to undertake
objective assessments due to bone metastases, we used com-
plete cases for the analyses.
RESULTS
Patients characteristics. A total of 103 patients with
PCa bone metastatic disease were screened for participation
and 57 patients were randomly assigned to the two study
arms, and progress through the study is shown in Figure 1.
Forty-six patients declined participation or were excluded
(Fig. 1). Patient characteristics are presented in Table 3.
There were no significant differences between groups at
baseline. Patients were 70.0 T 8.4 yr of age (mean T SD)
with a body mass index of 28.7 T 4.0 kgImj2 and had ex-
tensive bone disease with metastatic lesions present in the
pelvis (75.4%), femur (40.4%), rib/thoracic spine (66.7%),
lumbar spine (43.9%), humerus (24.6%), and other sites
(70.2%). Ninety-five percent of patients were undertaking
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and 16% of patients
were on current or previous chemotherapy. During the
course of the trial, five men withdrew from the exercise
program, whereas three men withdrew from the usual care
group (Fig. 1). There was no significant change in prostate-
specific antigen (P = 0.567) during the study period.
Self-reported physical function. There was no dif-
ference between groups for self-reported physical function
(P = 0.682) at baseline (Table 4). After 3 months of the
intervention, there was a significant difference between
groups for self-reported physical function favoring EX (3.2 points;
95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4–6.0 points; P = 0.028).

 Muscle strength, body composition, objective
measures of physical function, and fatigue. There
were no differences between groups at baseline for leg ex-
tension muscle strength, physical function, body composi-
tion, or fatigue (P = 0.214–0.824). Muscle strength differed
significantly between groups for the leg extension exercise
as a result of the intervention, with the EX group improving
at 3 months with an adjusted mean difference of 6.6 kg
(95% CI, 0.6–12.7; P = 0.033; Table 4). However, on the
basis of spine and upper body lesions, only four patients
were able to complete both baseline and 12-wk chest press
assessments, and as a result, data are not shown. There were
no changes for objective measures of physical function,
balance, lean mass, or total body fat mass. Furthermore,
there was no change in fatigue (P = 0.964) assessed by the
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy—Fatigue
during the study period.
Safety, tolerance, and attendance of the exercise
program. EX completed a mean of 32 T 10 of the 36 ex-
ercise sessions (89% attendance) with no exercise-related
adverse events or skeletal fractures. Reasons for missed sessions
were medical appointments, travel, and social commitments.
Session perceived exercise intensity (6–20 scale) was 12.7 T
1.2, perceived tolerance (0–7 scale) was 5.5 T 1.1, and Com-
mon Terminology Criteria pain grade (0–3 scale) was 0.2 T 0.3.
There were no changes in bone pain assessed by the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy—Bone Pain (P = 0.507).
DISCUSSION
This study examined the efficacy and safety of an M3EP
in PCa patients with bone metastases. There were four im-
portant findings: 1) self-reported physical functioning (pri-
mary study end point) and lower body muscle strength were
significantly increased in EX compared with CON; 2) nei-
ther bone pain nor skeletal events were exacerbated in EX as
a result of the intervention; and 3) the program was well
tolerated, and there was high attendance and compliance by
this group of patients who have extensive disease burden;
however, 4) body composition, objective measures of physical
function, and fatigue were not different between groups.

 Patients with bone metastases experience considerable
morbidity resulting from skeletal complications and decline
in physical function, with increased fatigue secondary to
chemotherapy for those with castrate-resistance PCa (4,27).
Our results demonstrated notable changes in self-reported
physical functioning of 3.2 points between study arms at 12 wk,
indicating significant and clinically relevant improvements in
physical functioning for the EX group. Declines of 3 points
reflect clinically meaningful changes (28), and we previously
showed similar changes of ~3.5 in patients with localized PCa
previously treated with ADT/radiation (17). We also provide
further evidence of muscle strength improvements in this group
of patients with advanced PCa, which extends previous work
in PCa patients with localized disease (8,17) and our pilot work
in those with bone metastases undertaking resistance training
as the sole intervention mode (29).
We found that neither bone pain nor skeletal events were
exacerbated in the EX group as a result of the interven-
tion. This is an important finding given the absence of clini-
cal data on exercise safety, tolerability, and efficacy in
PCa patients with bone metastases undertaking aerobic,
resistance, and flexibility modes of exercise, and that

 international guidelines have endorsed exercise training for
cancer patients (13) including those with bone metastases
without supporting empirical evidence. Specifically, our
modular multimodal targeted exercise program was designed to
minimize compressive and shear loads on affected skeletal sites
to account for the reduced load-bearing capabilities of bone
due to metastatic disease in specific regions (15). However,
because PCa primarily generates sclerotic (osteoblastic) le-
sions that commonly metastasize to the pelvis and axial
skeleton (30), our findings are limited to PCa patients with
sclerotic bone metastases. Ongoing studies are extending this
work by examining the safety and preliminary efficacy of con-
trolled spinal isometric training in PCa patients with sclerotic
lesions on tumor morphology and circulating metastatic tumor
biomarkers (31).
We also observed high attendance and compliance and
low attrition to the intervention, similar to patients with lo-
calized PCa undertaking short-term exercise programs (8).
Although the intervention in this study was highly super-
vised, the nature of the modular prescription approach is
patient inclusive, such that all patients can be prescribed
some amount of exercise, which therefore has the potential
to be performed and implemented in different centers reaching
a significant number of patients. This is particularly important
given the increased number of cohort studies suggesting an
association between increased exercise and PCa-specific and
overall survival (32,33). Furthermore, our findings contribute
substantially to identifying strategies to prescribe exercise
for patients with advanced PCa, particularly with recent
developments and changes in the clinical practice landscape
with novel pharmaceutical interventions (i.e., abiraterone,
enzalutamide) for metastatic castrate resistance PCa (mCRPC).
These are of clinical importance given that many mCRPC patients
will develop or have bone metastatic lesions. Furthermore, the
multimodal and modular components of the exercise prescription
support the exercise intervention of a phase 3 trial in mCRPC,
for which the primary outcome is overall survival (34,35).
Although patients improved their perceived physical
functioning and objective muscle strength, the lack of changes
in objective measures of physical function, body composition,
or fatigue is intriguing. This could be explained by the use of
very conservative modular exercise prescriptions so that all
patients received some form of intervention, and as a result,
the exercise stimulus may not have been sufficient to induce
changes in objective measures of physical function, lean mass,
or fat mass, or for fatigue. Furthermore, patients were inten-
tionally excluded from several measures on the basis of bone
metastases location, hence reducing the statistical power to
detect changes in some of these secondary study end points.
As a result, we intentionally used self-reported physical
function as our a priori primary study end point to capture
all patients with complete data.
Our study has several strengths and limitations worthy of
comment. This is the largest RCT evaluating the effects of
exercise in PCa patients with bone metastases or in any other
cancer group with bone metastatic disease, resulting to a
paradigm shift in relation to exercise prescription in ad-
vanced PCa. Our novel but conservative approach with
M3EP may have limited our ability to observe changes in
the patients’ achievable gains in our secondary end points.
We were only able to recruit 57 patients as opposed to 90
patients we originally planned; however, this was a very
challenging trial to recruit given the high disease burden of
patients, and as such, recruitment pathways were different
from those in patients with localized disease with referrals
largely dependent on a small team of oncologists. Never-
theless, we have shown significant and clinically meaningful
improvements in self-reported physical function (primary
study end point) with as little as 12-wk training undertaken
three times a week with high compliance and low attrition,
and this remains the largest exercise trial in patients with
bone metastases. Lastly, our protocol could be easily repli-
cated on a larger scale using the modular targeted exercise
program where exercise can be performed without the bone
metastatic lesions being loaded.
CONCLUSIONS
Exercise improved self-reported physical functioning in
PCa patients with bone metastases with no exercise-related
adverse events, skeletal fractures, or increased bone pain. In
addition, the program was well perceived and tolerated by
the patients. These changes are likely to provide clinically
meaningful benefits to PCa patients with bone metastases.
