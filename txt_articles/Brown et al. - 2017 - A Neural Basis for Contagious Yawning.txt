In Brief
Contagious yawning (CY) is triggered
involuntarily when we observe another
person yawn. Brown et al. use TMS to
investigate the neural basis for CY. They
demonstrate that TMS measures of motor
cortical excitability and physiological
inhibition are significant predictors of CY
and account for approximately 50% of the
variability in CY.

SUMMARY
Contagious yawning, in which yawning is triggered
involuntarily
when
we
observe
another
person
yawn, is a common form of echophenomena—the
automatic imitation of another’s words (echolalia)
or actions (echopraxia) [1]. The neural basis for echo-
phenomena is unknown; however, it has been pro-
posed that it is linked to disinhibition of the human
mirror-neuron system [1–4] and hyper-excitability of
cortical motor areas [1]. We investigated the neural
basis for contagious yawning using transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS). Thirty-six adults viewed
video clips that showed another individual yawning
and, in separate blocks, were instructed to either
resist yawning or allow themselves to yawn. Partici-
pants were videoed throughout and their yawns or
stifled yawns were counted. We used TMS to quan-
tify motor cortical excitability and physiological inhi-
bition for each participant, and these measures were
then used to predict the propensity for contagious
yawning across participants. We demonstrate that
instructions to resist yawning increase the urge to
yawn and alter how yawns are expressed (i.e., full
versus stifled yawns) but do not alter the individual
propensity for contagious yawning. By contrast,
TMS measures of cortical excitability and physio-
logical inhibition were significant predictors of conta-
gious yawning and accounted for approximately
50% of the variability in contagious yawning. These
data demonstrate that individual variability in the
propensity for contagious yawning is determined
by cortical excitability and physiological inhibition
in the primary motor cortex.
RESULTS
Contagious yawning has been demonstrated previously in
humans, chimpanzees, Old World monkeys, and dogs, and
can be triggered by hearing or seeing another individual
yawning [5]. Furthermore, watching or hearing another individ-
ual yawn activates a network of brain regions that are associ-
ated with motor imitation and empathy [3, 6]. For this reason,
contagious yawning has frequently been linked to the opera-
tion of the human mirror-neuron system (MNS) [3, 6], which
is thought to play a key role in action understanding, empathy,
and the synchronization of group social behavior [7]. However,
functional brain imaging studies have provided mixed evi-
dence in support of this proposal, and have reported that
core regions of the human MNS are not in fact activated
during contagious yawning [3, 6]. Furthermore, although the
propensity for contagious yawning varies across individuals,
a recent study has shown it to be stable across time (i.e., mea-
surement sessions) and also uncorrelated with empathy
scores [8].
Alternatively, it has been proposed that echophenomena,
including contagious yawning, may be generated automatically
by ethological releasing mechanisms responsible for triggering
stereotyped motor acts [9], and that the propensity for echo-
phenomena may be linked to individual differences in cortical
motor excitability [1]. This proposal is consistent with the
observation that echophenomena are observed within a few
weeks of birth but decrease after around 3 years of age,
consistent with the development of self-regulatory mecha-
nisms and reduced automatic imitation of observed actions.
It is also consistent with the demonstration that echopheno-
mena are observed in a wide range of clinical conditions linked
to increased cortical excitability and/or decreased physiolog-
ical inhibition (e.g., epilepsy, dementia, autism, Tourette syn-
drome) [1].
In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the pro-
pensity for contagious yawning was positively associated with
motor excitability. Specifically, we investigated whether individ-
ual differences in baseline measurements of motor cortical
excitability and physiological inhibition were associated with
the propensity for contagious yawning. Prior to commencing
the contagious yawning experiment, transcranial magnetic stim-
ulation (TMS) measures of cortical excitability and physiological
inhibition were recorded from the left primary motor cortex (M1)
for each participant and subsequently used to predict propensity
for contagious yawning.
The design of the experimental task is illustrated in Figure 1A.
Participants viewed video clips that showed another individual
yawning and, in separate blocks, were instructed to either resist
yawning or allow themselves to yawn. Blocks 1 and 2 were
completed without non-invasive electrical brain stimulation, but
during blocks 3 and 4 transcranial electrical stimulation (tES)
was delivered continuously to the supplementary motor area
(SMA) region of the scalp. It should be noted, however, that for

 brevity, only data recorded from blocks 1 and 2 will be reported
in this paper, and that the effects of tES on the propensity for
contagious yawning will be reported elsewhere.
Participants were videoed throughout, and their yawns and
stifled yawns were counted. In addition, throughout the experi-
ment the intensity of each participant’s perceived urge to yawn
was continuously recorded using a slider device that the partic-
ipant operated using his or her right index finger (Figure 1B). This
device delivered a continuous voltage signal that indexed
change over time in self-estimated intensity in the perceived
urge to yawn. Representative data from one individual are pre-
sented in Figure 1C.
Effects of Instruction on Yawning Behavior
To determine whether the instruction to resist yawning had an ef-
fect on yawning behavior, we examined the number of full and
stifled yawns observed during the first two blocks of trials.
Data were analyzed using a two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA with the factors Instruction condition (allow versus resist
yawning) and Yawn response (full versus stifled yawns). The
ANOVA
revealed
no
significant
main
effects
(maximum
F(1,34) = 2.22, p > 0.14) but a significant Instruction x Response
interaction (F(1,34) = 54.29, p < 0.0001). Relevant means are
presented in Figure 2. The simple effects of this interaction
demonstrated that whereas full yawns were substantially
reduced following the instruction to resist yawning (means: allow
condition, 5.23; resist condition, 0.17; t(34) = 6.31, p < 0.0001;
effect size [Hedges’ G] = 1.46), stifled yawns were significantly
increased by the instruction to resist yawning (means: allow con-
dition, 0.11; resist condition, 3.86; t(34) = 5.51, p < 0.0001; effect
size [Hedges’ G] = 1.28). These data confirm that the instruction
to suppress contagious yawning was only partially successful,
and led to a significant decrease in full yawns but an increase
in the number of stifled yawns observed (means: full yawns,
0.17; stifled yawns, 3.86; t(34) = �5.13, p < 0.0001; effect size
[Hedges’ G] = �1.25).
To further determine whether the instruction to resist yawning
had an effect on yawning behavior, we examined the sum total of
full and stifled yawns observed during the first two blocks of
trials. This analysis revealed that the means were not signifi-
cantly different from one another (resist, 4.03; allow, 5.34;
t(34) = �1.489 p > 0.05). This finding indicates that the instruction
to resist yawning significantly increases the urge to yawn
Figure 1. Design of the Behavioral Task
(A) Participants viewed video clips that showed another individual yawning
and, in four separate blocks, were instructed to either resist or permit them-
selves to yawn. Participants were videoed throughout and their yawns or
stifled yawns were counted. During the latter two blocks (3 and 4), excitatory
non-invasive electrical brain stimulation (anodal transcranial direct current
stimulation [tDCS] or transcranial random noise stimulation [tRNS]) was
delivered continuously to the cortical SMA region (contrasted with sham
stimulation). To ensure that participants paid attention to the videos, they were
required to answer a question (e.g., How many people in the videos were
wearing glasses?) after each block.

 (reported below) and alters how the yawn may be expressed (i.e.,
stifled yawns rather than full yawns), but it does not alter the
individual’s propensity for yawning. This is consistent with previ-
ous reports that although contagious yawning is variable across
individuals, an individual’s propensity for contagious yawning is
nevertheless highly consistent over time. It is also consistent with
our finding that the excitability of each individual’s motor cortex
(described below) is a significant predictor of the propensity for
contagious yawning.
Effects of Instruction on Self-Estimates of the Urge
to Yawn
We have argued elsewhere that whereas sensory signals may
trigger actions outside of awareness, a distinguishing feature
of urges for action is that they are chiefly associated with ac-
tions that cannot be realized immediately and must be held
in check until an appropriate time, when they can be released
[10]. To determine whether the instruction to resist yawning led
to an increase in perceived urge-to-yawn values in the current
study, we compared mean self-reported urge-to-yawn values
in the ‘‘allow’’ versus ‘‘resist’’ blocks of the pre-stimulation
period (i.e., blocks 1 and 2). A within-subject t test revealed
that urge-to-yawn estimates increased significantly when
participants were instructed to resist yawning compared to
when they allowed themselves to yawn (pre-stimulation block
means: allow, 0.15 units (0–1); resist , 0.18 units (0–1); t(35) =
�1.85, p < 0.04). These data are consistent with the pro-
posal that awareness of urges for action increases in circum-
stances where actions are suppressed or their execution is
delayed [10].
Effects of Motor Excitability and Physiological Inhibition
on Propensity for Contagious Yawning
It has been proposed that the propensity for echophenomena
such as contagious yawning may be linked to individual vari-
ability in cortical motor excitability [1]. To investigate this pro-
posal directly, we used a number of single- and paired-pulse
TMS protocols to measure cortical excitability and physiological
inhibition within the primary motor cortex of the left hemisphere
(contralateral to the dominant right hand). The measurements
obtained from each participant consisted of the following:
resting motor threshold (RMT); TMS recruitment curve (some-
times referred to as the input-output or IO curve); intracortical
facilitation (ICF); short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI); and
long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI). These measures
have been used repeatedly to characterize motor excitability
and physiological inhibition [11]. The reader is referred to STAR
Methods for methodological details.
To investigate directly whether individual differences in mea-
sures of cortical motor excitability and/or physiological inhibition
predicted individual variability in the propensity for contagious
yawning, we conducted separate stepwise regression analyses
of the total number of yawns (i.e., full + stifled) observed from
each participant in the allow and resist conditions. The analysis
confirmed that TMS measures were not a significant predictor
of the total number of yawns recorded in the resist condition
(all p < 0.1). By contrast, the stepwise regression analysis
demonstrated that a model based upon three factors, LICI,
RMT, and SICI, could significantly predict and account for close
to 50% of the individual variability in the number of full yawns
recorded in the allow condition (F = 10.71, p < 0.001). The order
of entry into the model for these factors was as follows: LICI
(coefficient = 4.15; t statistic = 3.89; p = 0.0005), F = 6.81, p =
0.014, R-squared value (Rsq) = 0.18, adjusted R-squared value
(Adj-Rsq) = 0.15; RMT (coefficient = �0.38; t statistic = �4.33;
p = 0.0002), F = 8.65, p = 0.001, Rsq = 0.36, Adj-Rsq = 0.32;
and SICI (coefficient = �6.78; t statistic = �3.14; p = 0.004),
F = 10.71, p < 0.001, Rsq = 0.52, Adj-Rsq = 0.47. It should be
noted that in this stepwise regression, the R-squared values
for RMT and SICI are calculated on the residual variance remain-
ing after the LICI and LICI + RMT fits, respectively, have been
accounted for.
LICI is a paired-pulse TMS protocol in which two supra-
threshold TMS pulses are delivered through a single coil with
an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 50–200 ms (see STAR Methods).
LICI typically leads to a reduction in the size of motor-evoked
potentials evoked from a standard TMS pulse, and is typically
reported as the ratio of the conditioned over an unconditioned
test motor-evoked potential amplitude. LICI is taken to reflect
physiological inhibition and is thought to be mediated by
GABA-B receptors [12]. The relationship in the current study be-
tween LICI and yawning is illustrated Figure 3A. Inspection of this
figure clearly illustrates that increased physiological inhibition
(i.e., conditioned/unconditioned motor-evoked potential ratio
trial values less than 1) is associated with a reduction in the num-
ber of yawns observed.
RMT is the amount of stimulation required (expressed as a
percentage of maximum stimulator output) to reliably generate
a motor-evoked potential motor-evoked potential of a pre-
defined magnitude (typically 50–100 mV) from a target muscle
at rest. RMT is thought to reflect the excitability of those cortico-
spinal neurons with the lowest excitation threshold that project
to the target muscle [13] and the TMS-induced excitability of
cortical-cortical fiber axons [12]; RMT is known to be highly var-
iable between, but not within, individuals [14]. The relationship in
the current study between RMT and the residual variance in
yawning (i.e., after variance due to 100-ms LICI is accounted
for) is illustrated in Figure 3B. Inspection of this figure clearly illus-
trates that lower motor thresholds are associated with an
increased number of yawns.
SICI is a paired-pulse TMS protocol in which two TMS pulses
are delivered in rapid succession (1–5 ms ISI) through a single
coil. However, in SICI protocols, a standard supra-threshold
TMS pulse is preceded by the delivery of a sub-threshold condi-
tioning pulse. SICI typically leads to a reduction in motor-evoked
potential amplitudes, and is thought to reflect the operation of
GABA-A-mediated inhibitory interneurons acting upon cortico-
spinal neurons [12]. Thus, LICI and SICI are thought to reflect
quite different mechanisms of physiological inhibition. In the
current study, and in contrast to the findings for LICI, we
observed that increased SICI was associated with an increase
in the number of yawns observed (Figure 3C). This finding is
consistent with the key role that GABA-A-mediated inhibition is
thought to play in the control of movement-related brain oscilla-
tions. Specifically, movement-related beta oscillation de-syn-
chronization, which is linked to the initiation of movements, has
been shown previously to be facilitated by increased GABA-A-
mediated inhibition [15].

 Effects of Motor Excitability and Physiological
Inhibition: Predicting the Effects of Instruction
The stepwise regression analyses revealed that none of the TMS
measures were statistically significant predictors of the number
of stifled yawns observed in the resist block (all p > 0.1). To inves-
tigate this issue further, we ran a further stepwise regression in
which we estimated whether the pre-stimulation TMS measures
(above) predicted the difference in the total number of yawns
(i.e., full + stifled yawns) exhibited in the resist versus allow con-
ditions. The analysis revealed a marginally significant effect for
RMT (F = 3.97, p < 0.055, Adj-R2 = 0.08). This indicates that those
individuals with a more excitable motor cortex (i.e., lower RMT
values) tended to exhibit larger negative differences in the num-
ber of yawns observed in the resist � allow subtraction.
Effects of Motor Excitability and Physiological Inhibition
on the Urge to Yawn
We conducted a stepwise regression to determine whether any
single pre-stimulation TMS measure (i.e., SICI, ICF, LICI, IO
slope, or RMT), or combination of TMS measurements, was a sig-
nificant predictor of the urge to yawn. The answer to this was that
they were not (all p > 0.05). This suggests that although motor
cortical excitability is a significant predictor of the propensity
for contagious yawning, it is not a significant driver of, or associ-
ated with, the urge to yawn. This finding is in fact consistent with
previous accounts that have proposed that the urge for action
may be associated primarily with upstream brain areas such as
the anterior insular cortex and cingulate motor area (e.g., [10]).
DISCUSSION
We investigated the neural basis for contagious yawning—an
example of echophenomena—using non-invasive brain stimula-
tion (TMS) techniques. Contagious yawning can be triggered by
seeing another individual yawn [5], but the propensity for conta-
gious yawning, although stable over time, is known to vary
across individuals [8]. Here we provide evidence that the propen-
sity for contagious yawning may be triggered automatically and
is strongly linked to the cortical excitability of the primary motor
cortex. Specifically, TMS was used to quantify baseline cortical
excitability and physiological inhibition within the primary motor
cortex and to predict behavioral measures of contagious
yawning, and we tested the hypothesis that the propensity
for contagious yawning was linked to the balance of cortical
excitability and physiological inhibition within the primary motor
cortex [1].
The key findings from the study can be summarized as fol-
lows. First, the instruction to resist yawning proved to be only
partially successful. Although it led to a significant decrease
in the number of full yawns observed, there was a significant
increase in the number of stifled yawns recorded. Furthermore,
when the numbers of full and stifled yawns were combined into
a single measure, the difference between the resist and allow
conditions was not statistically significant. Nonetheless, urge-
to-yawn estimates increased significantly when participants
were instructed to resist yawning. This is consistent with the
proposal that urges for action are chiefly associated with ac-
tions that cannot be realized immediately and must be held in
check. Together, these findings demonstrate that the instruc-
tion to resist yawning significantly increases the urge to yawn
and alters how the yawn may be expressed (i.e., stifled yawns
rather than full yawns), but it does not alter the individual’s pro-
pensity for yawning.
Second, the propensity for contagious yawning was shown to
be strongly predicted by individual variability in TMS measures of
cortical motor excitability and physiological inhibition recorded
from the hand area of the primary motor cortex.
We suggest that these findings may be particularly important
in understanding further the association between motor excit-
ability and the occurrence of echophenomena—observed in a
wide range of clinical conditions, e.g., epilepsy, dementia,
autism, and Tourette syndrome, that have been linked to
increased cortical excitability and/or decreased physiological in-
hibition [1].

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Participants
Thirty-six neurologically healthy young adults aged 18-26 years (mean: 20 ± 1.56 years) participated in this study. Prior to the study all
participants were screened for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) safety and
informed consent was obtained. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Nottingham school of psychology research
ethics committee. Two subjects were subsequently excluded from TMS data analysis: one due to their not tolerating the TMS pro-
cedure for long enough to collect a full data series; and the other due to their SICI response being more than 3 SD from the group
mean.
METHOD DETAILS
Study design
The aim of this study was to examine whether propensity for contagious yawning could be predicted by neurophysiological measures
obtained from M1 using TMS. TMS measures including RMT, IO curve, SICI, ICF, LICI were obtained. This was then followed by a
contagious yawning behavioral paradigm. Participants watched two blocks of video recordings featuring individuals yawning. In
each block, participants were asked to either freely yawn or resist yawning. The order of instructions was counterbalanced across
participants. In each block two different yawning responses (full yawn and stifle yawns) and urge to yawn were measured. Please note
that this study was conducted as part of a larger study. This larger study included four blocks of yawning video viewing and tES was
applied continuously during blocks 3 and 4. However, the analysis of contagious yawning in blocks 3 and 4, or the effects of tES, are
not included in the current paper and will be reported elsewhere.
TMS
A Magstim Bistim2, with a 70mm figure of eight branding iron coil, was used to administer TMS to the left M1 in an area corresponding
to the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle of the right hand. The motor hotspot was defined as the coil location that elicited maximal
motor-evoked potential responses in FDI by positioning the TMS coil over each subjects left motor cortex (M1) at approximately 45�.
The coil location was continuously tracked throughout the study, via BrainSight version 2.0 (Rogue Research ª 2016) with a template
brain scan. EMG responses were recorded using BrainVision system (BrainProducts GmbH, Germany) at a sampling rate of 5000 Hz
and band pass filtered (10-2000 Hz). Disposable Ag-AgCl surface electrodes (diameter 24mm) were placed onto the FDI muscle in a
standard ‘belly-tendon’ configuration.

 RMT and IO curves
Following localization of the motor hotspot, resting motor threshold (RMT) was obtained. Each subjects RMT was determined as the
minimum TMS intensity needed to elicit a FDI generated motor-evoked potential of at least 150–200 mV in a minimum of 5 out of 10
trials. TMS intensities administered ranged from 100% - 150% of RMT and delivered in 10% increments resulting in 6 TMS intensities
with an inter-trial interval (ITI) of 5 s. There were a total of 90 trials, which were split into 15 trials per TMS intensity. Trials were admin-
istered in a randomized order across the total number of trials. The IO curve measurements were estimated for each individual by
calculating the median motor-evoked potential amplitudes for each of the TMS intensities (i.e., 100%–150% of RMT). A linear fit
was then applied to the resulting values. Median values were calculated as opposed to the mean in order to limit the effect of
non-standard distribution of individual data.
Paired pulse TMS (SICI, LICI, & ICF)
Paired pulse TMS (ppTMS) was performed at four inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs); 1 ms, 3 ms (SICI), 12 ms (ICF) and 100 ms (LICI). For 1
and 3 ms SICI the conditioning stimulus (CS) was set as 55% of RMT, ICF at 75%, and LICI at 100% of RMT. The CS was followed by
TS at the intensity yielding 1 mV (SI 1mV) (20 trials per stimulus condition). There were also 60 unconditioned stimuli (total 140 trials).
All conditions were delivered in a pseudo-randomized order with an ITI of 6 s. Paired pulse TMS measures were reported at a ratio to
unconditioned responses (i.e., conditioned motor-evoked potential/unconditioned motor-evoked potential).
Behavioral task procedure
Directly following TMS procedures the participants completed the contagious yawning behavioral task. Participants were instructed
to watch a 20 min (2 blocks) video of actors yawning. In each block, participants were asked to either ‘freely yawn’ or ‘resist yawning’.
The order of instruction was counterbalanced across individuals. In both blocks participants were asked to pay close attention to the
screen and answer fours questions relating to the actors they would see such as, ‘how many actors were wearing glasses’. Answers
provided were later used to confirm that they were paying attention to the video clips appropriately. Each question was asked after
each block and prior to the next block.
The yawning stimuli video was produced in-house and comprised four 9 min blocks of video clips (total 52 clips) with each clip
ranging from 11-20 s in length. Each video clip featured either a female or male actor (aged 20-28 years) spontaneously yawning.
Each block of videos was also collated into 12 randomized video sets, which were then counterbalanced across all participants.
All videos were shown on an Apple Macintosh desktop (screen size 22 inch) via VLC media player software. Prior to the start of
each of the video blocks subjects were instructed to either ‘resist the urge to yawn’ or to ‘yawn freely’. In each block both stifle
and full yawns were measured.
Video clips were played continuously throughout the 9 min duration with no interval between each clip. However, each block was
separated by a 45 s interval. At the end of each block, participants had this 45 s interval to answer the question corresponding to that
particular block. For the duration that the video’ recording was playing each subjects face was recorded using Open Broadcaster
Software.
Each participant’s face was video-recorded using the computer’s built-in camera and OBS studio. They were also instructed to
record their subjective urge to yawn by continuously adjusting a custom-made slider throughout the duration of each block. The
length of the slider mechanism was 195mm, which was scaled to give urge readings between 0 (left end-no urge) and 1 (right
end-maximum urge). The slider reading was sampled at 32Hz using MATLAB 2010b (Mathworks, USA).
Yawn count procedure
Two naive raters were chosen to watch the covert video recordings and count the number of full yawns (FY) and stifled yawns (SY)
displayed by the subjects during each video block. The recordings were blinded in order to prevent the display of the block condition
to the raters. The two raters were also required to follow a strict yawn count protocol in order to ensure consistency and reliability.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The number of full yawns (FY) and stifled yawns (SY) displayed by the participants during each video block were counted using an
agreed yawn count protocol. Yawn counts were collated for each instruction (allow-yawning & resist-yawning) and condition (full &
stifled yawns) to allow us to examine the relationship between the TMS physiological parameters and the participants’ propensity for
contagious yawning. In addition, the participants’ subjective urge to yawn ratings for blocks 1 and 2 were also analyzed. Statistical
analyses included the following; two-way repeated-measures ANOVA of behavioral data with the factors Instruction condition (allow
versus resist yawning) and Yawn response (full versus stifled yawns); within-subject t tests; stepwise regression analysis; and a priori
planned independent-group t tests.
