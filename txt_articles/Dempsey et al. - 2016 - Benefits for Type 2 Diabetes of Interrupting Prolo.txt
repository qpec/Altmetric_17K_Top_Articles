 Benefits for Type 2 Diabetes of
Interrupting Prolonged Sitting
With Brief Bouts of Light Walking
or Simple Resistance Activities
Diabetes Care 2016;39:964–972 | DOI: 10.2337/dc15-2336
OBJECTIVE
To determine whether interrupting prolonged sitting with brief bouts of light-
intensity walking (LW) or simple resistance activities (SRA) improves postprandial
cardiometabolic risk markers in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
In a randomized crossover trial, 24 inactive overweight/obese adults with T2D (14
men 62 6 6 years old) underwent the following 8-h conditions on three separate
days (with 6–14 days washout): uninterrupted sitting (control) (SIT), sitting plus
3-min bouts of LW (3.2 km · h21) every 30 min, and sitting plus 3-min bouts of SRA
(half-squats, calf raises, gluteal contractions, and knee raises) every 30 min. Stan-
dardized meals were consumed during each condition. Incremental areas under
the curve (iAUCs) for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and triglycerides were compared
between conditions.
RESULTS
Compared with SIT, both activity-break conditions significantly attenuated iAUCs
for glucose (SIT mean 24.2 mmol · h · L21 [95% CI 20.4–28.0] vs. LW 14.8 [11.0–
18.6] and SRA 14.7 [10.9–18.5]), insulin (SIT 3,293 pmol · h · L21 [2,887–3,700] vs.
LW 2,104 [1,696–2,511] and SRA 2,066 [1,660–2,473]), and C-peptide (SIT 15,641
pmol · h · L21 [14,353–16,929] vs. LW 11,504 [10,209–12,799] and SRA 11,012
[9,723–12,301]) (all P < 0.001). The iAUC for triglycerides was significantly atten-
uated for SRA (P < 0.001) but not for LW (SIT 4.8 mmol · h · L21 [3.6–6.0] vs. LW 4.0
[2.8–5.1] and SRA 2.9 [1.7–4.1]).
CONCLUSIONS
Interrupting prolonged sitting with brief bouts of LW or SRA attenuates acute
postprandial glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and triglyceride responses in adults with
T2D. With poor adherence to structured exercise, this approach is potentially
beneficial and practical.
Lifestyle interventions, including exercise, are the recommended front-line therapy
in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D), even after the commencement of
hypoglycemic agents. Current guidelines stipulate that, in addition to 150 min/week
of moderate-vigorous aerobic exercise, individuals with T2D should engage in re-
sistance exercises at least 2–3 days/week (1). However, despite the known benefits,
particularly for glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, meeting prescribed

 exercise guidelines can be challenging,
and many with T2D remain physically
inactive (2).
Furthermore, fewer opportunities
now exist in modern societies for inci-
dental (nonexercise) physical activity.
Rapidly advancing technological innova-
tions in transportation, communications,
workplaces, and home entertainment
have created environments conducive to
prolonged periods sittingdsedentary be-
haviors, defined as any waking, sitting, or
reclining behavior with low-energy ex-
penditure (,1.5 METs) (3,4). Sedentary
behaviors are ubiquitous and increase
the risk of T2D, cardiovascular disease,
and premature mortality, even when
the influence of moderate-vigorous or
leisure-time physical activity is controlled
for(5,6).Therefore,in additionto increas-
ing purposeful exercise, decreasing sitting
time has the potential to reduce the bur-
den of T2D.
There is observational and experi-
mental evidence that sitting time with
brief interruptions can be associated
with a more favorable cardiometabolic
risk profile and postprandial metabolism
than is an equivalent amount of sitting
time accumulated in longer, uninter-
rupted bouts (7,8). In overweight/obese
adults at risk for T2D, interrupting sitting
time with 2-min walking bouts every
20 min reduced glucose and insulin re-
sponses(24–30%),irrespectiveofwhether
the bouts were of light or moderate inten-
sity (9). However, it is not known whether
such metabolic benefits extend to those
with T2D.
Moreover, limited consensus exists
on how prolonged sitting time should
be interrupted. Experimental studies to
date have only examined the utility of
intermittent standing or ambulatory
bouts, which may have differing levels of
metabolic stimulus, practicality, or health
efficacy. As an alternative, resistance-type
activities use the larger muscle groups
and markedly increase muscle activity
(.20-fold compared with sitting [10]),
potentially providing a potent stimulus
for increased energy expenditure and
for glucose uptake. They can also be
performed in a fixed position with min-
imal disruption to work tasks or leisure-
pursuits.
We examined, compared with unin-
terrupted sitting (SIT), the effects of
interrupting sitting time with brief bouts
of light-intensity walking (LW) or simple
resistance activities (SRA) on postpran-
dial metabolic responses in adults with
T2D. We hypothesized that postprandial
blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and tri-
glyceride levels during sitting would
be attenuated by brief intermittent
bouts of physical activity, irrespective
of modality.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Participants
Enrollment Process and Screening (Visit 1)
Overweight/obese (BMI $25 but ,40
kg/m2) men and women (aged 35–75
years) diagnosed with T2D (diet or met-
formin controlled, $3 months’ duration
[based on American Diabetes Association
diagnostic criteria] [11]) were recruited
from local community advertisements
and the Baker IDI Diabetes Clinic. All par-
ticipantswere required tobeinactive(i.e.,
currently sitting $5 h/day and not meet-
ing physical activity guidelines of $150
min/week of moderate-intensity exercise
for .3 months). Other exclusion criteria
were as follows: HbA1c ,6.5 or $9%, tak-
ing insulin or any other hypoglycemic
agents, pregnancy, pre/perimenopausal,
current smoker, employment in a nonse-
dentaryoccupation,majorsystemicillness,
known physical activity contraindications
(including the presence of cardiovascular
disease, unstable angina, or symptoms of
cardiac failure at screening visit), or major
illness or physical problems (acute or
chronic) limiting ability to perform the
light-intensity physical activities.
After initial telephone screening, all
potentially eligible participants attended
a medical screening at our laboratory that
included the following: anthropometric
measurements, resting blood pressure,
resting 12-lead electrocardiogram, blood
biochemistry (liver or renal function
and HbA1c), and a physical examination
performedbythestudy physician(N.D.C.).
Participants also underwent initial orien-
tation to the SRA and treadmill walking
during this visit to ensure the activity in-
terventions could be undertaken safely
and consistently.
Study Design
This randomized crossover trial was un-
dertaken at the Baker IDI Heart and Di-
abetes Institute between October 2013
and November 2014 and was approved
by the Alfred Human Research Ethics
Committee. Eligible participants pro-
vided written informed consent and
attended the laboratory on five sepa-
rate occasions: medical screening visit,
familiarization visit, and three trial con-
dition visits in a randomized order: 1)
SIT, 2) LW, and 3) SRA.
Randomization and Masking
Trial condition order was randomly as-
signed by a third party using computer-
generated random numbers and sealed
envelopes (block randomization and
balanced block sizes), stratified by sex.
Study personnel were blinded to the
condition order until the night prior to
the first trial condition. Participants
were blinded to trial condition order
up until commencement of the second
trial visit. Pathology technicians were
kept blinded to trial conditions.
Study Protocol and Trial Conditions
Familiarization (Visit 2)
Three to five days prior to the first ex-
perimental trial condition (visit three),
participants attended a familiarization
visit and were given further practice
with the SRA and treadmill walking. Par-
ticipants were also familiarized with all
study procedures, including weighed
food diaries and activity records, objec-
tive activity monitoring, and require-
ments for the restrictive lead-in phase
and fasting prior to each trial condition.
Prearranged, standardized text messag-
ing or e-mail prompts were used to max-
imize participant compliance.
Indirect Calorimetry
With the aim of characterizing the inter-
ventions, indirect calorimetry was com-
pleted either before visit three (n = 11)
(during familiarization visit) or after visit
five (n = 12) (during a sixth visit) based
on participant availability. Participants
reported to the temperature-controlled
(22–248C) laboratory at 0700–0800 h
after a 12-h overnight fast. After partic-
ipants voided and were weighed, a
TrueOne 2400 metabolic cart (Model
QMC; ParvoMedics, Sandy, UT) was
used to measure VO2, VCO2, and energy
expenditure (kcal z min21) (based on the
Weir equation [12]) over an ;75-min
period. (See Supplementary Table 1 for
additional data handling and calibra-
tions details.) During this time, partici-
pants completed a protocol divided into
two sequential parts (outlined below),
each part capturing periods of quiet sit-
ting, interspersed with either a 3-min
bout of LW or SRA, in a randomized order:

 Part 1: 20-min sitting quietly → 3-min

Part 2: 15-min sitting quietly → 3-min
activity LW-2/SRA-2 → 10-min sitting
quietly → 3 min LW-2/SRA-2 → 15-min
sitting quietly → protocol finishes.
Trial Conditions (Visits 3–5)
Figure 1 shows the overall study proto-
col. Since an acute exercise session may
enhance insulin action for up to 48 h
(13), a 6- to 14-day washout period
between trial conditions was used to
eliminate potential carryover effects.
Participants were asked to refrain from
structured moderate-vigorous physical
activities (i.e., no physical activity be-
yond activities of daily living), caffeine,
and alcohol for 48 h prior to each exper-
imental condition.
During the washout period between
experimental conditions, participants
resumed their habitual diet and physical
activity patterns. From visit two (famil-
iarization visit) until visit five (final trial
condition), participants wore acceler-
ometers (GTX3+; ActiGraph, Pensacola,
FL) during waking hours for objective
measurements of sedentary time and
physical activity. The 1-min epoch ac-
tivity data were processed to derive
average sedentary (,100 cpm), light-
intensity (100–1,951 cpm), and moderate-
vigorous ($1,952 cpm) activity time on
valid ($10 h) days (14).
For minimizing of any potential diet-
induced variability during testing condi-
tions, medication times were standardized
and food intake was strictly controlled
starting from the night before each trial
visit. Meals were standardized between
conditions and were individualized to
meet daily estimated energy require-
ments (Schofield equation [15], 1.5
physical activity factor) and a target
macronutrient profile of 12–15% en-
ergy from protein, 55–58% energy
from carbohydrate, and 29–31% energy
from fat. For accommodation of dietary
preferences, participants were able to
select from a range of meal options,
and each meal provided 33% estimated
energy requirements (mean 6 SD 823 6
124 kcal/meal). Breakfast options in-
cluded bran-based cereal, fruit salad,
ham-and-cheese croissant, and juice.
Lunch options included a salad and
meat bread roll and commercially avail-
able drink. An evening meal pack, con-
sisting of a commercially available drink,
snack, and microwave meal, were also
provided for participants to prepare at
home on the evenings prior to experi-
mental conditions.
After a 12-h overnight fast, participants
reported to the laboratory at 0715 h.
After voiding and being weighed, they
remained seated while an indwelling
catheter was inserted into an antecubital
vein and fasting samples collected before
(21 h) and after (0 h) a 60-min steady-
state period (Fig. 1). Each experimental
condition commenced upon starting the
breakfast meal, with the time taken to
consume (,20 min) replicated in subse-
quent conditions. At 3.5 h, participants
consumed lunch (,20 min). Postprandial
blood samples were collected at 30-min
intervals (immediately prior to physical
activity bouts on activity days) over each
7-h condition.
Participants consumed water ad libi-
tum during the first trial condition and
were then instructed to replicate the
volume consumed in subsequent trial
conditions. Standardized lavatory visits
incorporated into the protocol mini-
mized unscheduled physical activity;
however, additional lavatory visits
were permitted. Participants complied
with the respective trial condition proto-
cols under direct supervision from re-
search staff.
Figure 1—Study design and protocol for treatment conditions. Participants visited the laboratory on five separate occasions. The 3 trial conditions
were completed in a randomized order separated by a 6- to 14-day washout. Blood was collected half-hourly, 2 min prior to each activity bout. Each
standardized meal (mean 6 SD 822.9 6 124.3 kcal/meal) constituted 33% of participants’ daily estimated energy requirements (Schofield equation
[15], physical activity factor 1.5) with a target macronutrient profile of 55–58% energy from carbohydrate, 12–15% energy from protein, and 29–31%
energy from fat.

Diabetes Care Volume 39, June 2016
 The three trial conditions were as
follows.
SIT. Participants sat upright in a comfort-
able chair throughout the experimental
period and were instructed to minimize
excessive movement, only rising from
the chair to void.
LW. Participants rose from the seated
position every 30 min throughout the
experimental period (except during the
lunch meal) and completed a 3-min bout
of LW on a treadmill (zero gradient,
3.2 km z h21) and then returned to the
seated position. This procedure was un-
dertaken on 12 occasions (i.e., 36 min
total light-intensity activity).
SRA. Participants underwent a protocol
identical to that of the LW condition, ex-
cept that participants completed 3-min
bouts of SRA (total: 36 min) instead of
LW. The 3 min was divided into a total of
nine 20-s movement segments, alternat-
ing between body weight half-squats,
calf raises, gluteal contractions, and
knee raises. The interchange between
movements was to provide rest for the
corresponding muscle groups between
eachmovementsegment,allowingforcon-
tinual muscle activation over the 3-min
period. To ensure appropriate movement
standardization, tempo, and correct
form, participants mimicked a standard-
ized, preprepared video recording (prac-
ticed in visits one and two). Range of
motion (knee/hip angle 45–908 for half-
squats/knee raises) was tailored to par-
ticipants’ ability, as assessed during visit
one.
Participants had access to television,
DVDs, books, magazines, and internet
services during the trial conditions. Ac-
tivity intensity during the trial condi-
tions was monitored using heart rate
monitoring (RS400; Polar Electro Oy,
Kempele, Finland) and the Borg rating of
perceivedexertion(RPE)(range:minimum–
maximum 6–20) scale. The mean dif-
ferences for heart rate (immediately
postactivity bout minus preactivity;
mean 6 SEM) for the LW and SRA activity-
break conditions were 17 6 1.2 bpm
(range 8–31) and 19 6 1.0 bpm (range
10–30) and for mean RPE were 9 6 0.3
points (range 7–12) and 10 6 0.3 points
(range 7–13), respectively.
Biochemical Analysis
Code-labeled samples were sent to an
independent National Association of
Testing Authorities (NATA)/The Royal
College of Pathologists of Australasia
(RCPA)-accredited laboratory on the day
of testing for the determination of glucose,
insulin, and C-peptide levels. Plasma glu-
cose (fluoride/oxalate) was measured
using a hexokinase method. Serum insulin
and C-peptide were measured using a
chemiluminescent microparticle immuno-
assay (Architect ci16200; Abbott Diagnos-
tics, Santa Clara, CA). Plasma triglycerides
(from EDTA tubes, stored at 2808C) were
analyzed using a COBAS Integra 400+ ana-
lyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).
Statistical Analyses
Coprimary outcomes were changes in
net incremental area under the curve
(iAUC) (trapezoidal method) for plasma
glucose and insulin. Sample size calcu-
lations were based on a previous trial
conducted in our laboratory (9) using
similar methodology in overweight/
obese adults (24–30% and 23% de-
crease in glucose and insulin, respec-
tively), an effect similar in magnitude
to that which may be observed after a
single bout of moderate-intensity cy-
cling in patients with T2D (16). Therefore,
we estimated that 17 paired observa-
tions would be needed to achieve 90%
power to detect the smallest expected
effect size (Cohen d = 0.84) in the primary
outcome variables between the interven-
tions (control vs. breaks in sitting, two
sided, 5% level). For accommodation of
potential withdrawals, 24 participants
were randomized. Across all trial condi-
tionsandparticipants, 3% ofoutcome val-
ues (34 of 1,152 data points) were
missing and treated as such in subse-
quent analyses.
After recent recommendations on
data analysis of crossover trials (17),
generalized linear mixed models (with
random intercepts were used to evalu-
ate the differential effects of the exper-
imental conditions on the selected
outcomes using Stata 12 (StataCorp LP).
All models were adjusted for poten-
tial confounders explaining residual
outcome variance (age, sex, and BMI),
preprandial values (iAUC only), and
period effects (treatment order). Sex-
by-condition interaction tests were
performed for each of the iAUC outcome
measures. Residuals were examined for
serial correlation, heteroscedasticity,
and normality. Substantial departures
from model assumptions were not ob-
served. A two-tail probability level of
0.05 was adopted. Data are expressed
as mean 6 SEM or mean (95% CI) unless
otherwise stated.
RESULTS
Of the 29 participants who attended
screening, 24 were randomized and
completed all trials (Fig. 2). There were
no dropouts after randomization. There
were 14 men and 10 women of mean 6
SD age 62 6 6 years with BMI 33.0 6 3.4
kg/m2, HbA1c 7.2 6 0.7% (55.1 6 8.0

mmol z L21, fasting HDL cholesterol
1.1 6 0.3 mmol z L21 and LDL cholesterol
2.5 6 0.8 mmol z L21, systolic blood

23 taking metformin, n = 15 taking statins,
and n = 16 taking antihypertensive therapy
(included n = 16 taking an ACE inhibitor or
angiotensin II receptor blocker, n = 5 a cal-
cium channel blocker, n = 11 a thiazide
diuretic, and n = 2 a b-blocker). Aside
from BMI (men 31.5 kg/m2 vs. women
35.2 kg/m2, P = 0.0051) and baseline (fast-
ing) insulin levels (men 70.6 pmol z L21 vs.
women 106.4 pmol z L21, P = 0.0035),
there were no significant differences
in sex-related baseline parameters or
medications.
Anthropometric, biochemical, dietary,
and accelerometer-derivedphysical activ-
ity data before each of the respective trial
conditions are presented in Table 1. Apart
from preprandial C-peptide (adjusted for
in statistical models), there were no sig-
nificant differences between trials for any
of these measurements.
Based on indirect calorimetry mea-
surements (n = 23) (Supplementary
Table 1), compared with 15 min sitting
quietly, a bout of LW and SRA increased
mean energy expenditure (kcal z min21)
by 73 6 5% and 121 6 7%, respectively.
A bout of SRA, compared with a bout of
LW, elicited a significantly greater in-
crease (relative to 15 min sitting quietly)
in mean VO2 (0.13 6 0.01 L z min21),
VCO2 (0.08 6 0.01 L z min21), and energy
expenditure (0.58 6 0.06 kcal z min21)
(all P , 0.001); however, the opposite
effect was observed for respiratory ex-
change ratio (VCO2/VO2) (20.02 6 0.01;
P , 0.05).

 Figure 3 shows mean glucose, insulin,

during each of the trial conditions. Net 7-h
iAUC during both of the activity-bout con-

attenuated compared with SIT for glu-
cose (SIT mean 24.2 mmol z h z L21
[95% CI 20.4–28.0], LW 14.8 [11.0–

(SIT 3,293 pmol z h z L21 [2,887–3,700],
LW 2,104 [1,696–2,511], and SRA 2,066
[1,660–2,473]), and C-peptide (SIT
15,641 pmol z h z L21 [14,353–16,929],
LW 11,504 [10,209–12,799], and SRA
11,012 [9,723–12,301]). The iAUC for tri-
glycerides was attenuated significantly
for SRA compared with SIT (P , 0.001)
but not for LW (SIT 4.8 mmol z h z L21
[3.6–6.0], LW 4.0 [2.8–5.1], and SRA 2.9
[1.7–4.1]). Differences between SRA and
LW were only significant for triglyceride
levels (P = 0.048). Meal-specific effects
(3.5-h iAUC per meal) are displayed in
Supplementary Table 2.
A significant sex-by-condition interac-
tion effect was observed for the mean
difference in glucose net iAUC between
conditions SIT and LW (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1), indicating that, while LW
resulted in significantly lowered glucose
net iAUC for both sexes, the magnitude
of the glucose attenuation for LW versus
SIT was greater (↓58% vs. ↓26%) in
women than in men (mean iAUC differ-
ence in lowering between women and
men 26.8 mmol z h z L21 [95% CI 213.46
to 20.14; P = 0.045]). The sex-by-condition
interaction for SRA versus SIT trended sim-
ilarly (↓53% vs. ↓31%) but was nonsignifi-
cant (24.6 mmol z h z L21 [211.17 to
1.98]; P = 0.17). No significant sex-by-
condition interactions were observed for
any other outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates, for the first
time in inactive overweight/obese men
and women with T2D, that interrupting
prolonged sitting with brief bouts of ei-
ther LW or SRA effectively attenuates
postprandial glucose (mean change
↓39%), insulin (LW ↓36%, SRA ↓37%),
and C-peptide (LW ↓27%, SRA ↓30%) re-
sponses. Despite the novel modality and
relative increase in energy expenditure
for the SRA bouts compared with LW,
glucose, insulin, and C-peptide responses
were comparable between the two con-
ditions. Triglyceride levels tended to be
lower for both activity types; however,
only the iAUC reduction for SRA (↓40%)
was statistically significant.
This study builds on hypotheses gen-
erated from epidemiological observa-
tional research on the metabolically
beneficial correlates of breaking up sit-
ting time and recent experimental trials
demonstrating the acute metabolic ben-
efits of interrupting prolonged sitting
with light- (18) and moderate-intensity
(9) bouts of ambulation. Our findings
extend upon this work by providing
new insights regarding the potential ef-
ficacy of this novel, lifestyle-based treat-
ment strategy (interrupting prolonged
sitting) in adults with T2D; the potential
efficacy of an alternative, simple, and
practical form of sitting interruption
(brief bouts of SRA); and that 3-min light
activity bouts every 30 min (versus, for
example, ;2 min walking breaks every
20 min [9,18], 5-min walking or stand-
ing bouts every 30 min [19], or 15-min
postmeal walking bouts [16,20]) may
also be a useful prescription target.
Our findings are consistent with a re-
cent study of similar design in over-
weight adults showing reduced glucose
and insulin responses from brief inter-
ruptions to sitting, irrespective of activ-
ity bout intensity (9). They are also
consistent with recent findings in post-
menopausal women at high risk of T2D
(19), which showed metabolic benefits
with both walking and standing bouts
for 5 min every 30 min. Furthermore,
Peddie et al. (18) demonstrated that, in
healthynormal-weightadults,interrupting
prolonged sitting with intermittent bouts
of walking (1 min and 40 s every 30 min)
was more effective than a single 30-min
bout of moderate-vigorous walking in re-
ducing postprandial glycemia. This is con-
sistent with other experimental studies
(21–23) suggesting that the manner in
which physical activity (or sitting time) is
accumulated may differentially influence
postprandial glucose handling. Indeed,
van Dijk et al. (16) recently showed in
adults with T2D that, compared with pro-
longedsitting, both a45-min boutofmod-
erate exercise and three 15-min bouts of

 light-intensity activity over a day of sitting
were effective in lowering postprandial
glucose and insulin responses. Remark-
ably, the shorter, more frequent activity
bouts used in our study appear to have
resulted in comparable, if not greater,
reductions in glucose and insulin re-
sponses. This difference in magnitude
change could be due to sex, participant
attributes, or methodological differences
or the longer sitting duration used by van
Dijk et al. Nonetheless, our findings and
those of van Dijk et al. underscore the
potential metabolic importance of in-
creasing intermittent physical activity
across a day of prolonged sitting for
glycemic control in patients with T2D.
These findings hold clinical and public
health relevance for three key reasons.
First, postprandial excursions in glucose,
insulin, and triglycerides can trigger oxi-
dative stress,elevated inflammatory cyto-
kines, reduced nitric oxide bioavailability,
and endothelial dysfunction (24,25). This
dysmetabolic profile represents a direct
and independent risk factor for the devel-
opment of diabetic and cardiovascular
complications in patients with T2D, even
in those receivingoral blood glucose med-
ications (26,27). Second, patients with
T2D are more likely to be physically inac-
tive (28) and overweight/obese and have
reduced exercise tolerance, with uptake
of public health exercise recommenda-
tions remaining a persistent challenge at
the population level (29–31). Third, our
findings provide evidence for two novel
lifestyle-based treatment strategies (LW
and SRA bouts) with a degree of meta-
bolic efficacy (postprandial lowering of
glucoseandinsulin)indirectlycomparable
with an acute 45-min bout of moderate
exercise followed by a day of prolonged
sitting in T2D patients (16). This is an im-
portant finding given the intermittent na-
ture andlowintensityoftheactivitybouts
performed by our participants.
Responsible mechanisms remain un-
clear and will require further study. How-
ever, the inherent nature of sitting
clearly does not lend itself to skeletal
muscle contractile activity, increased en-
ergy expenditure, or augmented blood
flow/shear stress (32). Therefore, it
may be hypothesized that the reduction
in glucose levels during the brief activity
bout conditions, consistent with prior
mentioned studies of similar design,
are the result of localized increases in
contractile-mediated (insulin-independent)
glucose uptake. Moreover, the concur-
rent reductions ininsulinlevels with phys-
ical activity suggest less of a reliance on
insulin-mediated glucose uptake, with
concomitant reductions in C-peptide lev-
els (amarkerofendogenousinsulin secre-
tion) further reinforcing this notion.
Other possible mediators associated
with increased postural alterations and
light muscle activity may include hemo-
dynamic changes (i.e., increased blood
volume, tissue perfusion, and capillary
permeability [33–35]), as well as modula-
tionofintracellular signaling changes(i.e.,
AMPK, translocation/turnover of GLUT4,
and calcium-activated proteins [36]), in-
creased muscle insulin sensitivity, or
changes in sympathetic nervous system
activity. It is also possible that the effects
of simply standing up more regularly
could have significantly contributed to
the observed metabolic effects (19), po-
tentially via combinations of hemody-
namic, hemodilutional, or minimal muscle
contractile activity. While these mecha-
nistic possibilities could not be ascertained
from our study design, they should be ex-
amined in future research in populations
with T2D. This could involve longer sta-
bilization periods in the standing posi-
tion, prior to each activity bout, to
account for any potential additive meta-
bolic effect of the physical activity itself.
Moreover, it remains to be determined
whether different activity bout modali-
ties provide unique physiological bene-
fits and to what extent they inhibit the
adverse consequences of prolonged sit-
ting. Future studies should examine the
optimal frequency, duration, and inten-
sity of activity bouts to determine the
specific translational potential for the
management of T2D.
The nonsignificant reduction in tri-
glyceride iAUC during the LW condition
is consistent with the intermittent walk-
ing (1 min and 40 s every 30 min) condi-
tion of Peddie et al. (18) in healthy
normal-weight adults, who notably also
demonstrated a significant lowering in

 triglycerides with a single 30-min bout of
moderate-vigorous walking. However,
the significant triglyceride reduction dur-
ing the resistance activity condition in our
study is a novel finding and a first in pa-
tients with T2D. Plausible reasons for the
comparatively lower triglyceride levels
with both walking and resistance activi-
ties may be due to our trial condition or
activity bouts being of longer duration
than some previous studies, which is
broadly consistent with studies that
have observed reductions in triglycerides
the next day after using both intermittent
and continuous walking interventions
(37,38); the less natural modality (subjec-
tive comments from participants not
reported), increased activity stimulus (in-
tensity and energy expenditure), and
lower respiratory exchange ratio during
the SRA bouts (indicating a relative in-
crease in lipid oxidation); differences in
the participants studied (healthy vs.
overweight/obese patients with T2D);
or the nutritional composition (i.e.,
higher glucose-to-fat ratio) of test
meals.
In light of epidemiological findings
documenting sex differences in the as-
sociations of television-viewing time with
cardiometabolic biomarkers (39,40),
our findings offer some initial experi-
mental insights suggesting that (post-
menopausal) women with T2D may
derive greater reductions in postprandial
glucose than men by interrupting their sit-
ting time with LW. Although we suspected
that the greater glucose reductions may
berelated to increasesin activity intensity,
we did not observe significant increases
in heart rate, oxygen consumption, or per-
ceived exertion for women compared
with men. Differences in adipose and
lean body mass or other biological dispar-
ities between men and women with T2D
could be the potential basis for these
findings. Future studies should continue
to elucidate sex-specific effects.
Key strengths of our study include the
focus on both men and women with
overt T2D, the well-described and stan-
dardized trial condition lead-in periods
(as illustrated by minimal variance in
confounder variables such as diet, phys-
ical activity, and fasting metabolic levels
during trial condition lead-in periods)
through the use of weighed food re-
cords and objectively measured physical
activity, standardized calorimetric as-
sessment of the two modes of activity
bout, the strict behavioral supervision
and standardized feeding of a typical
Western diet during experimental con-
ditions (as opposed to less ecologically
valid test drinks), full retention of par-
ticipants and minimal data loss, and the
collection of regular blood time points
during trial visits for more robust time
course and iAUC calculations.
The present trial also has some limi-
tations that future studies could ad-
dress. First, the acute nature of the

Interrupting Sitting Time and Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 39, June 2016
 current study precludes extrapolations
about longer-term exposures to the par-
ticular conditions that we examined. It is
presently unknown whether our ap-
proach is beneficial over a longer period
of time or whether the putative benefits
can be sustained in ways that have pre-
viously been shown in longer-term trials
that included aerobic exercise (41). Sec-
ond, although this well-controlled study
has offered insights into the metabolic
consequences of prolonged sitting and
the incorporation of alternate modes of
intermittent activity bouts, generaliz-
ability to free-living settings is less cer-
tain and may not always reflect habitual
behaviors. For example, in the workplace,
other factors such as stress and workload
may also play a role in glycemic homeo-
stasis. Third, the exploratory sex analyses
in this study should be interpreted with
caution, given the limited sample size,
which may have increased the risk of
type 1 errors. Finally, the standardized
Western dietary feeding profiles (42)
used during this trial, while arguably
more reflective of real-world scenarios,
will inevitably vary in daily life settings
(e.g., macronutrient profile, glycemic in-
dex, meal frequency, and size). Although
our specific focus was on standardized
meal responses to the sedentary and ac-
tivity patterns, suchdietaryvariations and
their interactions with physical activity
are an integral piece of the puzzle and
will require further examination.
Pragmatically, both activity condi-
tions were easily tolerated and well ac-
cepted by our T2D participants (based
on subjective comments collected at
the end of each trial condition [data
not shown]), and it appears the benefi-
cial metabolic effects of interrupting
prolonged sitting can be achieved with
different modes of light-intensity activ-
ity. In this regard, both LW and SRA
bouts may have application irrespective
of individual ability or workplace or home
context encountered. For example, SRA
bouts require no specialized equipment,
only small amounts of space, and could
be easily performed behind a work desk
or at home with minimal disruption to
work tasks or leisure pursuits, whereas
light walking may be more convenient
and socially acceptable in certain con-
texts. Longer-term engagement in either
mode of activity bout may also elicit dif-
fering physiological effects (e.g., in-
creased muscle strength, bone density,
and physical function) that are presently
unknown. Taken together, while this
study provides a first piece of experimen-
tal evidence on the potential benefits of
interrupting prolonged sitting in T2D
patients, further mechanistic studies and
interventions in larger samples in ecolog-
ically relevant, free-living, and workplace
environments, using a broader range of
participants (including premenopausal
women and patients with less well-
controlled T2D [e.g., patients with poorly
controlled diabetes on insulin or sulfo-
nylurea dependent, with b-cell dysfunc-
tion and increased risk of experiencing
hypoglycemia]), will be informative in
developing more specific public health
guidelines for the management of T2D.
In conclusion, interrupting prolonged
sitting with brief LW or SRA bouts signif-
icantly attenuates postprandial glucose,
insulin,C-peptide,andtriglycerideresponses
in adults with T2D. With the ubiquity of
sedentary behaviors and the low adher-
ence to structured exercise, these two
approaches are practical strategies that
may contribute toward reducing the risk
of diabetes complications and cardiovas-
cular complications. The efficacy and
sustainability of our particular approach
should be tested in larger and longer-
duration trials, as has been done for aer-
obic exercise interventions in the T2D
context (41). Nonetheless, our findings
contribute complementary initial exper-
imental evidence to further inform the
existing, albeit broad, T2D exercise rec-
ommendations to “increase daily move-
ment through unstructured activity to
gain additional health benefits” (1).
Thus, in addition to the essential promo-
tion of purposeful moderate-vigorous
andleisure-timephysical activity,it seems
prudent and nonmaleficent (primum non
nocere) that health care professionals
consider promoting the message, or pro-
viding prescriptive advice to T2D patients,
to also regularly interrupt prolonged sit-
ting time.
