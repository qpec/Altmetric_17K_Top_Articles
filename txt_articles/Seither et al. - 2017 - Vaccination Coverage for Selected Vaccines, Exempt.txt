State and local school vaccination requirements help protect 
students and communities against vaccine-preventable diseases 
(1). CDC reports vaccination coverage and exemption data 
for children attending kindergarten (kindergartners) collected 
by federally funded immunization programs in the United 
States.* The typical age range for kindergartners is 4–6 years. 
Although vaccination requirements vary by state (the District 
of Columbia [DC] is counted as a state in this report.), the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends 
that children in this age range have received, among other vac-
cinations, 5 doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis 
vaccine (DTaP), 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vac-
cine (MMR), and 2 doses of varicella vaccine (2). This report 
summarizes 2016–17 school year MMR, DTaP
, and varicella 
vaccination coverage reported by immunization programs in 
49 states, exemptions in 50 states, and kindergartners provi-
sionally enrolled or within a grace period in 27 states. Median 
vaccination coverage† was 94.5% for the state-required number 
of doses of DTaP; 94.0% for 2 doses of MMR; and 93.8% 
for 2 doses of varicella vaccine. The median percentage of 
kindergartners with an exemption from at least one vaccine§ 
was 2.0%, similar to 2015–16 (1.9%). Median grace period 
and provisional enrollment was 2.0%. Vaccination coverage 
remains consistently high and exemptions low at state and 
national levels. Local-level vaccination coverage data provide 
opportunities for immunization programs to identify schools, 
districts, counties, or regions susceptible to vaccine-preventable 
diseases and for schools to address undervaccination through 
* Federally funded immunization programs are located in the 50 states and
District of Columbia (DC) (“states”), five cities, and eight U.S territories and
freely associated states (“territories”). Two cities reported data to CDC, which
were included in their state data to calculate medians. Immunization programs 
in U.S. territories reported vaccination coverage and exemptions to CDC;
however, these data were not included in median calculations.
† Median vaccination coverage was determined using estimates for 49 states;
Oklahoma and Wyoming did not report data because of widespread problems 
with the quality of data reported by schools. Data from cities and territories
were not included in median calculation.
§ Median exemption rate was determined using estimates for 46 states; Wyoming 
did not report data because of widespread problems with the quality of data
reported by schools, and Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri were
excluded because they could not report the number of kindergartners with an
exemption because of the way they collect the data. Data from local areas and
territories were not included in median calculation.
implementation of existing state and local vaccination policies 
(1) to protect communities through increased coverage.
Federally funded immunization programs partner with
departments of education and school nurses and other school 
personnel to assess vaccination coverage and exemption status 
of children enrolled in public and private kindergartens.¶ In 
accordance with state and local school entry requirements, par-
ents and guardians submit their children’s vaccination records 
or exemption forms to schools, or schools obtain kindergart-
ners’ records from their states’ immunization information 
systems. During the 2016–17 school year, 49 states reported 
data on coverage for all state-required vaccines among public 
and private school kindergartners, 50 states reported exemption 
data on public school kindergartners, and 49 states reported 
exemption data on private school kindergartners. Seven states 
reported coverage and exemption data for at least some home-
schooled kindergartners.** Twenty-seven states reported data 
on kindergartners who, at the time of the assessment, were 
attending school under a grace period (a set number of days 
during which a student can be enrolled and attend school with-
out proof of complete vaccination or exemption) or provisional 
enrollment (a provision that allows a student without complete 
vaccination or exemption to attend school while completing a 
catch-up vaccination schedule).
During the 2016–17 school year, vaccination assessments 
varied by immunization program because of differences in 
state requirements regarding required vaccinations and number 
of doses required, vaccines assessed, school assessment, data 
reported, and available resources. Among the 50 states report-
ing data, 35 used a census to collect kindergarten vaccination 
¶ Assessment date varied by state/area.
 
** California included data for independent study students in public school data 
and data for homeschools with six or more students in private school data. 
Massachusetts included two virtual schools in the public school data. North 
Dakota reported some homeschool data separately. Oregon reported some 
homeschool data separately; children enrolled in public online homeschools 
were included in the public school data. Pennsylvania included all 
homeschooled students in their public school data. Utah included some 
homeschooled students in public and private school data. Vermont included 
homeschooled students in their public and private school data if the students 
were enrolled in one or more classes at a school; homeschooled children who 
were exclusively homeschooled were not subject to vaccination requirements 
and were not included in these estimates.

data; nine used a sample; four used a voluntary school response; 
and two used a mix of sampling methods.†† States used the 
same methods to collect both vaccination coverage and exemp-
tion data, except in Alaska, Kansas, Virginia, and Wisconsin, 
where a sample was used to collect vaccination coverage data 
and a census to collect exemption data. Five states (Delaware, 
Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, and South Carolina) used a 
sample for both vaccination coverage and exemption data. 
Kindergartners were considered up-to-date and included in 
the coverage estimate for a given vaccine if they received all 
doses required for school entry,§§ except in seven states¶¶ that 
considered kindergartners up-to-date only if they had received 
all doses of all vaccines required for school entry in those states. 
Kindergartners with a history of varicella disease were reported 
as either vaccinated against varicella or medically exempt, vary-
ing by immunization program. Medical exemptions were issued 
by a health care provider; all other exemptions (i.e., religious 
and philosophical) were nonmedical.
This report presents vaccination coverage for MMR, 
DTaP
, and varicella vaccines. Coverage for these vaccines and 
hepatitis B and poliovirus vaccines that are required in most 
states is presented on SchoolVaxView (3). Vaccination coverage 
and exemption estimates were adjusted based on survey type 
and response rates.*** Medians and ranges of state MMR 
vaccination coverage and of exemption rates collected from 
†† States using a census attempted to collect data from all kindergartners at all 
schools and succeeded in collecting data for ≥90% of students. The type of 
sample employed by the nine states using a sample to collect coverage data 
varied and included a stratified two-stage cluster sample (eight states) and a 
stratified one-stage cluster sample (one state). A voluntary response of schools 
was defined as a census survey with a response rate <90% of the known 
population of kindergartners. A mix of methods included two or more 
described sampling methods, usually a census for one school type and 
voluntary response for the other.
§§ All 50 states and DC required 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine;
MMR is the only measles-containing vaccine available in the United States. 
Local DTaP requirements varied. Nebraska required 3 doses, four states
(Illinois, Maryland, Virginia, and Wisconsin) required 4 doses, Pennsylvania 
did not require pertussis vaccination, and all other states required 5 doses, 
unless the fourth dose was administered on or after the fourth birthday.
The reported coverage estimates represent the percentage of kindergartners 
with the state-required number of DTaP doses, except for Kentucky, which 
required 5 doses of DTaP by age 5 years, but reported 4-dose coverage for 
kindergartners. Eight states required 1 dose of varicella vaccine and 42 states 
and DC required 2 doses.
¶¶ Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and New 
Jersey considered kindergartners up-to-date only if they had received all doses 
of all vaccines required for school entry.
 *** Most immunization programs that used census or voluntary response 
provided CDC with data aggregated at the state or local (city or territory) 
level. Coverage and exemption data based on a census or voluntary response 
were adjusted for nonresponse using the inverse of the response rate, stratified 
by school type (public, private, and home school, where available). Programs 
that used complex sample surveys provided CDC with deidentified data 
aggregated at the school or county level for weighted analysis. Weights were 
calculated to account for sample design and adjusted for nonresponse for 
data collected through complex sample design wherever possible.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Immunization programs conduct annual kindergarten vaccina-
tion assessments to monitor school-entry vaccination coverage 
for all state-required vaccines.
What is added by this report?
Median vaccination coverage was 94.0% for 2 doses of measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine; 94.5% for the state-required 
number of doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis 
vaccine; and 93.8% for 2 doses of varicella vaccine. The median 
exemption level remained low (2.0%) but exemption rates 
varied by state. The median proportion of kindergartners under 
a grace period or provisional enrollment was 2.0%, the same as 
in 2015–16.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Vaccination coverage might vary at the local level. School 
assessment allows immunization programs to focus on schools 
with lower vaccination coverage and higher exemption levels, 
allowing schools to follow up with undervaccinated students to 
help ensure kindergartners are protected from vaccine 
preventable diseases.
the 2011–12 school year through the 2016–17 school year 
were examined over time. During the 2016–17 school year, 
vaccination coverage data were reported for approximately 
3,973,172 kindergartners, exemption data for approximately 
3,666,870, and grace period and provisional enrollment data 
for approximately 2,463,131.†††
Since the 2011–12 school year, median kindergarten MMR 
vaccination coverage has remained near 95% and median 
exemption rates have remained ≤2% (Figure). Among the 
49 states included in this analysis, median MMR coverage 
was 94.0% (range = 85.6% [DC] to 99.4% [Mississippi]); 
20 states reported coverage ≥95%; and six states (Alaska, 
Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, and DC) reported cover-
age <90% (Table 1). Among the 48 states that required and 
reported DTaP vaccination, median coverage was 94.5% 
(range = 82.2% [DC] to 99.6% [Maryland]); 23 states reported 
coverage ≥95% and six states (Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, 
Idaho, Kansas, and DC) reported coverage <90%. Among the 
42 states that required and reported 2 doses of varicella vaccine, 
median coverage was 93.8% (range = 84.6% [DC] to 99.4% 
[Mississippi]); 15 states reported coverage ≥95%, and seven 
states (Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Washington,

decreased by >1.0 percentage points in two states (California 
and Vermont) and increased by >0.5 percentage points in 
seven states (Alaska, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, New

reported exemptions by type, the median percentage of medical 
exemptions was 0.2% (range = <0.1% in two states [Delaware 
and New Mexico] to 1.5% [Alaska]), and the median percent-
age of nonmedical exemptions was 1.8% (range = 0.5% [DC] 
to 6.5% [Oregon]).

approached 95%, and the median exemption rate among 
children attending kindergarten was 2%; these rates have 
been relatively consistent since the 2011–12 school year. The 
median percentage of kindergartners attending school under 
a grace period or provisional enrollment was 2.0%. Although 
vaccination rates have remained high and stable, four states 
have reported coverage <90% for at least one vaccine for at 
least 6 consecutive years (3). In addition, coverage can vary 
within states, and clusters of undervaccinated kindergartners 
can exist in states with high overall rates.
Four states (California, New York, North Dakota, and 
Tennessee) reported increases in coverage of ≥1.5 percent-
age points for all reported vaccines (3); these increases 
might have resulted from programmatic measures to address

reported to CDC); NReq = not required for school entry.
* Estimates were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted for sampling where appropriate. Estimates based on a completed vaccination series (i.e., not vaccine-
specific) use the “≥” symbol. Coverage might include history of disease or laboratory evidence of immunity.
† The kindergarten population is an approximation provided by each program.
§ Sample designs varied by state/area: census = program attempted to include all schools (public and private),and all children within schools in the assessment, 
and had a student response rate of ≥90%; 1-stage or 2-stage cluster sample = schools were randomly selected, and all children in the selected schools were
assessed (1-stage) or a random sample of children within the schools was selected (2-stage); voluntary response = a census with a student response rate of <90% 
(does not imply that participation was optional).
¶ Some programs publish kindergarten vaccination data online that are more detailed than the state-level estimates in this table. Examples of more detailed data 
include county, parish, school district, and school-level estimates.
** MMR is the only measles containing vaccine available in the United States. Most states require 2 doses of MMR; Alaska, New Jersey, and Oregon require 2 doses 
of measles, 1 dose of mumps, and 1 dose of rubella vaccines. Georgia, New York, New York City, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia require 2 doses of 
measles and mumps, 1 dose of rubella vaccines. Iowa requires 2 doses of measles and 2 doses of rubella vaccines.
†† Pertussis vaccination coverage might include some diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and pertussis vaccine (DTP) vaccinations if administered in another country or 
by a vaccination provider who continued to use DTP after 2000. Most states require 5 doses of DTaP for school entry; Illinois, Maryland, Virginia, and Wisconsin 
require 4 doses; Nebraska requires 3 doses. Pennsylvania does not require pertussis vaccine. The reported coverage estimates represent the percentage of 
kindergartners with the state-required number of DTaP doses, except for Kentucky, which requires ≥5 but reports ≥4 doses of DTaP.
§§ Median calculated from data from 48 states and the District of Columbia (i.e., does not include Oklahoma, Wyoming, Houston, New York City, Guam, Marshall 
Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, N. Mariana Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico, or U.S. Virgin Islands). Coverage data were reported for 3,973,172 kindergartners.
¶¶ The proportion surveyed likely was <100%, but is reported as 100% based on incomplete information about the actual current enrollment.
*** Did not include some types of schools, such as online schools or those located in military bases or correctional facilities.
††† Kindergarten vaccination coverage data were collected from a sample, and exemption data were collected from a census of kindergartners.
§§§ Counted some or all vaccine doses received regardless of Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended age and time interval; vaccination
coverage rates reported might be higher than those for valid doses.
¶¶¶ For Nebraska, estimates represent coverage among children in kindergarten and first grade. For Palau, estimates represent coverage among children in first grade.
 
**** Reported public school data only.

new nonmedical exemptions for kindergartners attending 
public or private school (4,5) and continued to educate school 
staff members on criteria for provisional enrollment, thus 
reducing provisional enrollment from 4.4% to 1.9% (6). New 
York conducted webinars to train school staff members on 
vaccination requirements, exemptions, and exclusion policies; 
coverage increased by >1.5 percentage points for all reported 
vaccines in 2016–17 (Assessment Branch, Immunization 
Services Division, CDC, unpublished data, 2017). In North 
Dakota, school superintendents were educated about the 
importance of immunizations and their mandated role in 
enforcement of requirements (7), which prompted most school 
districts in the state to begin strict enforcement of school

in 2016–17. In Tennessee, the immunization program worked 
to increase the proportion of public school kindergartners 
who were completely up to date in the state’s immunization 
information systems and to improve schools’ capacity to cor-
rectly assess student vaccination status; MMR, DTaP
, and 
varicella vaccination coverage increased >3 percentage points

In 12 of 27 states reporting for the 2016–17 school year, 
the percentage of children provisionally enrolled or within a 
grace period at the time of the assessment exceeded the per-
centage of children with exemptions for one or more vaccines, 
indicating that children who do not have exemptions are not

† Medical exemptions, nonmedical exemptions, and grace period/provisional enrollment status might not be mutually exclusive. Some children might have both 
medical and nonmedical exemptions, and some enrolled under a grace period/provisional enrollment might be exempt from one or more vaccinations.
 
§ A grace period is a set number of days during which a student can be enrolled and attend school without proof of complete vaccination or exemption. Provisional 
enrollment allows a student without complete vaccination or exemption to attend school while completing a catch-up vaccination schedule. In states with one or 
both of these policies, the estimates represent the number of kindergartners within a grace period, provisionally enrolled, or some combination of these categories.
 
¶ Medians calculated from data from 45 states and District of Columbia; states/jurisdictions excluded were Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wyoming. 
Houston, New York City, Guam, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, N. Mariana Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands were also excluded. 
Exemption data were reported for 3,666,870 kindergartners. Grace period/provisional enrollment median was calculated from data from 27 states; data were 
reported for 2,463,131 kindergartners.
 ** Philosophical exemptions were not allowed.
 †† Religious exemptions were not allowed.
 §§ Religious and philosophical exemptions were not reported separately.
 ¶¶ Program did not report the number of children with exemptions, but instead reported the number of exemptions for each vaccine, which could count some 
children more than once. Lower bounds of the percentage of children with any exemptions estimated using the individual vaccines with the highest number of 
exemptions are: for Colorado, 0.2% with medical exemptions, 0.3% with religious exemptions, 3.1% with philosophical exemptions, and 3.6% with any exemptions; 
for Illinois, 0.2% with medical exemptions, 1.2% with religious exemptions, and 1.4% for any exemptions; for Minnesota, 0.2% with medical exemptions, 3.1% with 
nonmedical exemptions, and 3.3% for any exemptions; and for Missouri 0.2% with medical exemptions, 2.0% with religious exemptions, and 2.2% for any exemptions.
 
*** For Nebraska, estimates represent exemptions among children in kindergarten and 1st grade. For Palau, estimates represent coverage among children in 1st grade.

MMWR / October 13, 2017 / Vol. 66 / No. 40
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
within a grace period for the 2016–17 school year was 2.0%, 
which is the same as for the 2015–16 school year. Pennsylvania’s 
estimated grace period and provisional enrollment prevalence 
increased from 5.1% to 8.1%, probably because the assess-
ment date changed from March 31 in the 2015–16 school 
year to December 31 in the 2016–17 school year, giving stu-
dents enrolled under the grace period less time to complete 
required vaccination and documentation (Assessment Branch, 
Immunization Services Division, CDC, unpublished data, 
2017). CDC encourages programs to collect and use these data 
to identify areas with high rates of provisional or grace period 
enrollment, where increasing coverage through a targeted 
intervention might be possible.
The number of states sharing local-level school vaccination 
coverage increased from 25 to 30 (8). The online sharing of 
local-level data with the public contributes to transparency in 
public health by placing information about the risk for vaccine 
preventable diseases in the hands of parents and communities. 
The type of data published (exemptions, vaccine-specific cov-
erage, complete vaccination, compliance with documentation 
requirements, and other information) varies across states, as 
does the geographic level of detail (school, school district, 
county, region of the state, or other geographic or administra-
tive area), and the method of displaying the data (table, chart, 
map, or other format).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions, which have been reported previously (8). First, compa-
rability is limited because of variations in states’ requirements, 
data collection methods, and definitions of grace period and 
provisional enrollment. Second, representativeness might be 
negatively affected because of data collection methodologies 
that miss some schools or students or assess vaccination status 
at different times. Collecting vaccination and exemption data 
from a validated census of schools and students can improve 
comparability and representativeness of the data, and there-
fore, census data are the most programmatically useful. The 
majority of immunization programs do use a census to collect 
vaccination and exemption data. Third, actual vaccination 
coverage, exemption estimates, or both might be under- or 
overestimated because of improper or absent documentation. 
Finally, median coverage estimates include only 48 of 50 states 
and DC, median exemptions estimates include only 45 of 50 
states and DC, and the median grace period or provisional 
enrollment estimate includes only 27 states for the 2016–17 
school year.
Kindergarten vaccination requirements provide an oppor-
tunity for children to be fully vaccinated with recommended 
age-appropriate vaccines and to catch up on any missed early 
childhood vaccinations. CDC works with immunization pro-
grams to monitor kindergarten vaccination coverage, improve 
data quality, and promote data use for effective program 
planning. Based on state-level kindergarten vaccination data 
reported to CDC, median vaccination coverage was consis-
tently high and median exemption rates were consistently 
low. However, clusters of low vaccination coverage continue 
to serve as opportunities for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable 
diseases (9). Because vaccination coverage and exemption levels 
are clustered locally, availability of local-level vaccination data 
can help immunization programs identify schools that might 
be vulnerable in an outbreak. CDC is working with programs 
to improve collection and use of grace period and provisional 
enrollment data to understand contributing factors for reported 
undervaccination and identify programmatic actions that 
might increase vaccination coverage among kindergartners.
