Introduction
Mouse and rabbit antibodies are fundamental tools for numerous 
basic research techniques and medical diagnostic assays. The 
detection or immobilization of these primary antibodies is most 
often performed indirectly via polyclonal anti-IgG secondary 
antibodies. The need for a continuous supply of anti-IgG sera 
requires keeping, immunizing, bleeding, and eventually kill-
ing large numbers of goats, sheep, rabbits, and donkeys, which 
is not only costly but also a major animal welfare and ethical 
problem (Shen, 2013; Reardon, 2016). Furthermore, every new 
batch of serum contains another heterogeneous mixture of anti-
bodies, which need to be affinity-purified on IgG columns and 
then depleted (by preadsorption) of nonspecific and cross-re-
acting antibodies. Moreover, the success of this procedure has 
to be laboriously quality controlled each time. The large size 
of secondary antibodies (∼10–15 nm; 150 kD) is also a dis-
advantage, because it limits tissue penetration and introduces 
considerable label displacement, reducing the obtainable image 
resolution by superresolution fluorescence microscopy methods 
(Ries et al., 2012; Szymborska et al., 2013; Pleiner et al., 2015). 
Their nonrecombinant nature further precludes genetic engi-
neering (tagging or fusion to reporter enzymes).
Why then, have recombinant anti-IgG detection reagents 
not replaced polyclonal secondary antibodies? The major 
issue is signal strength. The signal in traditional immunofluo-
rescence, for example, is amplified by (a) multiple secondary 
IgG molecules binding to distinct epitopes of a primary anti-
body; (b) a large IgG tolerating many labels per molecule; and 
 
(c) their bivalent binding mode exploiting avidity for high- 
affinity target recognition. In light of these facts, it appears very 
challenging to achieve comparable signal levels with a small, 
monovalent, monoclonal reagent.
We considered nanobodies, single-domain antibodies de-
rived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies (Hamers-Casterman 
et al., 1993; Arbabi Ghahroudi et al., 1997; Muyldermans, 
2013), as perhaps the best candidates for such reagents. Be-
cause of their small size (∼3 × 4 nm; 13 kD), the possibility 
of their renewable production as recombinant fusion proteins, 
and favorable biophysical properties, nanobodies attracted con-
siderable attention as powerful tools in cell biology (Helma et 
al., 2015) and structural biology (Desmyter et al., 2015), and as 
future therapeutic agents (Van Bockstaele et al., 2009; Kijanka 
et al., 2015). They are particularly useful for superresolution 
imaging (Ries et al., 2012; Szymborska et al., 2013; Pleiner et 
al., 2015; Göttfert et al., 2017; Traenkle and Rothbauer, 2017). 
The resolving power of some of the best microscopes reported 
to date (e.g., ∼6 nm by Balzarotti et al. [2017]; ∼10–20 nm by 
Xu et al. [2012] or Huang et al. [2016]) may be reduced as a re-
sult of the offset between fluorescent label and target introduced 
by primary and secondary antibodies (20–30 nm). Site-specifi-
cally labeled nanobodies represent a promising solution to this 
problem, because they can place fluorophores closer than 2 nm 
to their antigen and, despite their small size, even tolerate up to 
three dyes (Pleiner et al., 2015).
In this study, we describe the generation of a comprehen-
sive toolbox of nanobodies against all mouse IgG subclasses and 
rabbit IgG. This work required very extensive optimizations of 
Polyclonal anti–immunoglobulin G (anti-IgG) secondary antibodies are essential tools for many molecular biology tech-
niques and diagnostic tests. Their animal-based production is, however, a major ethical problem. Here, we introduce a 
sustainable alternative, namely nanobodies against all mouse IgG subclasses and rabbit IgG. They can be produced at 
large scale in Escherichia coli and could thus make secondary antibody production in animals obsolete. Their recombi-
nant nature allows fusion with affinity tags or reporter enzymes as well as efficient maleimide chemistry for fluorophore 
coupling. We demonstrate their superior performance in Western blotting, in both peroxidase- and fluorophore-linked 
form. Their site-specific labeling with multiple fluorophores creates bright imaging reagents for confocal and superreso-
lution microscopy with much smaller label displacement than traditional secondary antibodies. They also enable simpler 
and faster immunostaining protocols, and allow multitarget localization with primary IgGs from the same species and of 
the same class.

our routine nanobody selection efforts, such as a time-stretched 
and thus affinity-enhancing immunization scheme, subsequent 
affinity maturation including off-rate selections, as well as 
testing and improving ∼200 initial candidates. When labeled 
site-specifically with fluorophores, the resulting nanobodies 
performed remarkably well in Western blotting and immunoflu-
orescence. In contrast to polyclonal secondary antibodies, they 
even allow single-step multicolor labeling and colocalization. 
In stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STO 
RM; Rust 
et al., 2006) of microtubules, an anti–mouse κ light chain nano-
body showed greatly reduced fluorophore offset distances, sug-
gesting its use as a superior alternative to traditional anti-mouse 
secondary antibodies. Moreover, we show that anti-IgG nano-
bodies can be conjugated to HRP or expressed as fusions to 
ascorbate peroxidase (APEX2; Lam et al., 2015) and thus used 
for enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting, colorimetric 
ELI 
SAs, or immuno-EM detection. These monoclonal recom-
binant nanobodies are thus perfect substitutes for conventional 
animal-derived polyclonal secondary antibodies. We envision 
that they can be engineered to enable a more versatile use of the 
plethora of existing antibodies and even allow the development 
of more sophisticated antibody-based diagnostic tests.
Results
A comprehensive anti-IgG nanobody toolbox
We immunized two alpacas separately with polyclonal mouse 
or rabbit IgG and used chemically biotinylated mouse mAbs 
of defined subclasses as well as rabbit IgGs for phage display 
selections of nanobodies from the resulting immune libraries. 
First results with the initially obtained anti-IgG nanobodies were 
rather disappointing: we experienced dim and noisy signals in 
immunofluorescence as well as in Western blots. We reasoned 
that an increase in affinity and specificity might yield improved 
reagents, and therefore we reimmunized the animals after a 1-y 
pause. For this, we used IgGs prebound to multivalent particu-
late antigens expected to provide strong T-helper cell epitopes. 
Moreover, we increased the stringency of the subsequent phage 
display selections by lowering the bait concentration down to 
the femtomolar range, which should not only select per se for 
sub-nanomolar binders, but also bring displayed nanobodies 
in direct competition with each other, because the number of 
bait molecules was up to 1,000-fold lower than the number of 
displaying phages. Finally, we performed in vitro affinity mat-
urations by random mutagenesis and further rounds of phage 
display, this time also combined with off-rate selections. In this 
way, we obtained a large toolkit of anti–rabbit and anti–mouse 
IgG nanobodies (Fig. 1 a).
All nanobodies were extensively characterized for sub-
class specificity, epitope location on Fab or Fc fragment, and 
cross reactivity to IgGs from other species (Figs. 1 b and S1 a). 
Their full protein sequences are listed in Table S1, and plasmids 
for the bacterial expression of selected nanobodies will also 
be distributed by Addgene (IDs 104157–104164). Notably, we 
identified nanobodies against all four mouse IgG subclasses and 
the sole rabbit IgG subclass. Strikingly, many anti–mouse IgG 
nanobodies target IgG1, which represents the most abundant 
Figure 1. Characterization of the anti-IgG nanobody toolbox. (a) Overview of all identified anti-IgG nanobodies. The nanobodies obtained were char-
acterized for IgG subclass and light chain specificity, epitope location on Fab or Fc fragment, and species cross reactivity. The protein sequences of all 
anti-IgG nanobodies can be found in Table S1. Nb, nanobody; CDR III, complementarity-determining region III; Gp, guinea pig; Hs, human; κ, κ light 
chain; λ, lambda light chain; Fab, fragment antigen-binding, Fc, fragment crystallizable. (b) IgG subclass reactivity profiling of selected anti–mouse IgG 
nanobodies representing all identified specificity groups. The indicated IgG species were spotted on nitrocellulose strips, and the strips were blocked with 
4% (wt/vol) milk in 1× PBS. Then 300 nM of the indicated tagged nanobodies were added in milk. After washing with 1× PBS, bound nanobodies were 
detected using a fluorescence scanner. Note that the signal strength on polyclonal IgG depends on the relative abundance of the specific subclass (e.g., 
IgG2b and IgG3 are low abundance) or light chain (κ/λ ratio = 99:1). TP885 and TP926 showed no detectable binding to polyclonal Fab or Fc fragment 
and might bind to the hinge region. MBP, maltose binding protein; poly, polyclonal.

subclass of commercially available mouse mAbs (∼62–64%), 
followed by IgG2a (∼22–24%), and the less frequent IgG2b 
(∼13%) and IgG3 (∼1–2%). Because the vast majority (∼99%) 
of mouse mAbs possess a κ light chain, anti–κ chain nanobodies 
promised to be the most broadly useful tools, and we therefore 
actively selected for such binders by swapping the IgG heavy 
chain subclass during sequential selection rounds. For the iden-
tification of binders targeting the rare λ chain, we had to prede-
plete the nanobody immune library of heavy chain and κ chain 
binders. Some of the identified nanobodies have mixed spec-
ificities, e.g., multiple mouse Fab-binders target an interface 
between κ light chain and IgG1 or IgG2a heavy chain. Most 
anti–mouse IgG nanobodies are exclusively mouse specific, 
whereas some additionally cross react with rat IgG (Fig. S1 a). 
The anti–rabbit IgG nanobody TP897 also efficiently recognizes 
guinea pig IgG. All nanobodies were produced by cytoplasmic 
expression in Escherichia coli, mostly with an N-terminal His-
NEDD8-tag for purification by Ni(II) chelate affinity capture 
and proteolytic release (Frey and Görlich, 2014). They were 
further equipped with ectopic cysteines for subsequent maleim-
ide labeling reactions (Pleiner et al., 2015). Without further op-
timization, we typically obtained yields of 15 mg/l of bacterial 
culture, which already suffices for a million immunofluores-
cence stains or 200 liters of Western blotting solution.
We first assessed whether the anti-IgG nanobodies were 
specific and could purify their IgG target from its common 
source. Anti–rabbit IgG nanobodies TP896 and TP897 isolated 
polyclonal rabbit IgG from crude rabbit serum with high speci-
ficity (Fig. S1 b). Likewise, anti–mouse IgG nanobodies TP881 
and TP885 could purify an IgG1 mAb from hybridoma cell 
culture supernatant (Fig. S1 c). Notably, nanobody-bound IgG 
was released under physiological conditions using SUM 
OStar 
protease cleavage (Pleiner et al., 2015). The main virtue of this 
approach is perhaps not to purify IgGs from sera, but rather 
to perform immune-affinity purifications of antigens or antigen 
complexes that have been prebound to the primary antibodies. 
In contrast to traditional IPs, this approach makes it possible 
to release the purified complexes under fully native conditions.
Western blotting with HRP-conjugated 
anti-IgG nanobodies
We next tested the performance of anti-IgG nanobodies as 
detection reagents in Western blotting, which is a major ap-
plication for secondary antibodies. A popular mode of signal 
detection in Western blotting is ECL, in which antibody–HRP 
conjugates are used. HRP is a heme-containing enzyme that 
catalyzes the oxidation of luminol in the presence of H2O2 to 
yield bright chemiluminescence, which is greatly increased by 
phenol-derived enhancers. We conjugated maleimide-activated 
HRP to anti–mouse IgG1 Fc nanobody TP1107 via a C-terminal 
cysteine (Fig. S2 a) and used the resulting conjugate in ECL 
Western blotting. The nanobody–HRP conjugate is functional 
and outperformed a polyclonal secondary antibody–HRP con-
jugate from a commercial supplier (Fig. 2 a). The anti–rabbit 
IgG nanobody TP897 could also be linked to HRP, and the re-
sulting conjugate was functional and specific. Uncropped blots 
are shown in Fig. S2 b. Both TP1107 and TP897 also performed 
better than two poorly characterized commercially available an-
ti-IgG nanobodies (Fig. S2 c).
Recombinant APEX2 fusion to anti-IgG 
nanobodies
Because of its stability and the breadth of its catalyzed colori-
metric or chemiluminescent reactions that allow strong signal 
amplification, HRP is the preferred enzyme for conjugation to 
secondary antibodies. However, it still has to be isolated from 
horseradish roots as a mixture of different isoforms, cannot be 
made on a practical scale and with a useful specific activity in 
E. coli (Krainer and Glieder, 2015), and fails entirely as a ge-
netic fusion to bacterially expressed nanobodies.
As an alternative, we tested the engineered APEX2 (Mar-
tell et al., 2012; Lam et al., 2015) as a fusion partner of the 
anti–mouse IgG1 Fc nanobody TP1107. The TP1107–APEX2 
fusion was not only well expressed and soluble in E. coli (Fig. 
S2 d), but it was also active and efficiently catalyzed the oxi-
dation of the initially colorless substrate Amplex Ultra Red to 
the highly fluorescent resorufin (Fig. 2 b). In line with previous 
studies (Lam et al., 2015), HRP seemed slightly more efficient 
than APEX2 in catalyzing this reaction. Nonetheless, low fem-
tomolar amounts of TP1107–APEX2 could be detected, sug-
gesting its applicability, for instance, in ELI 
SA assays as well 
as in immunohistochemistry and enzymatic antigen localization 
in immuno-EM applications.
Western blotting with infrared fluorophore–
linked anti-IgG nanobodies
A convenient alternative to peroxidase conjugation or fusion is 
the labeling of secondary antibodies with infrared fluorescent 
dyes. In fact, infrared fluorescent Western blotting has emerged 
as a superior alternative to classical ECL. It offers high signal-

nanobodies. (a) A twofold dilution series of Xenopus 
egg extract was blotted and probed with anti-Nup62 
mouse IgG1 mAb A225. It was then decorated with 
HRP-conjugated goat anti–mouse polyclonal IgG 
(5 nM) or anti–mouse IgG1 Fc nanobody TP1107 
(5 nM) and detected via ECL. Similarly, a rabbit poly-
clonal antibody targeting Nup54 was decorated with 
HRP-conjugated goat anti–rabbit polyclonal IgG or 
anti–rabbit IgG nanobody TP897 (5 nM). (b) Oxida-

anti–mouse IgG1 Fc nanobody TP1107–APEX2 fusion 
was incubated with Amplex Ultra Red and H2O2. Oxi-
dation leads to formation of the fluorescent compound

parameter logistic regression. The inflection points of 
the curves can be used to compare attainable sensitiv-
ity. A.U., arbitrary units. Error bars, mean ± SD (n = 3).

to-noise ratios, allows straightforward quantification because of 
signal linearity over many orders of magnitude, and even enables 
the simultaneous dual-color detection of multiple proteins. We 
thus labeled anti-IgG nanobodies site-specifically with the infra-
red fluorophore IRDye 800 at a C-terminal cysteine (Pleiner et 
al., 2015). The anti–rabbit IgG nanobody TP897 alone performed 
just as well as a commercial polyclonal anti–rabbit IgG second-
ary antibody when it was used with rabbit polyclonal antibodies 
to detect various nucleoporins (Nups) in a Xenopus laevis egg ex-
tract (Fig. 3 a). Similarly, the anti–mouse IgG1 Fc-specific nano-
body TP1107 gave signal intensities comparable to or even higher 
than a polyclonal anti–mouse IgG secondary antibody in Western 
blotting on HeLa cell lysate (Fig. 3 b). Combinations of TP1107 
with the compatible anti–mouse IgG1 Fab-specific nanobody 
TP886 or the anti–mouse κ chain nanobody TP1170 provided 
clearly better detection sensitivity than the polyclonal secondary 
antibody. TP1170 allows sensitive detection of IgG2a subclass 
mAbs, as shown here for the detection of the bacteriophage minor 
coat protein pIII (Fig. 3 c). Uncropped Western blots are shown 
in Fig. S3. We routinely found infrared fluorophore–labeled an-
ti-IgG nanobodies to yield higher detection sensitivity than their 
HRP-conjugated counterparts. When combined with the com-
patible IRDye 680, dual-color blots using, for example, mouse 
and rabbit primary antibodies are easily possible (Fig. 3 d). In 
contrast to polyclonal secondary antibodies, IRDye-labeled an-
ti-IgG nanobodies give a clean and strong signal when prebound 
to primary antibodies before application. This makes a separate 
incubation with the secondary antibody dispensable and saves up 
to 2 h of processing time per blot. We explored such a one-step 
staining strategy in more detail for immunofluorescence (see sec-
tion Rapid one-step immunostaining and colocalization).
Single- and multicolor imaging with anti-IgG 
nanobodies
We next sought to assess the performance of the anti-IgG 
nanobodies as detection reagents in conventional indirect 
Figure 3. Western blotting with infrared 
dye–labeled anti-IgG nanobodies. (a) A two-
fold dilution series of Xenopus egg extract was 
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. 
The indicated rabbit polyclonal antibodies 
were used to detect Nups. These primary an-
tibodies were then decorated via either IRDye 
800–labeled goat anti–rabbit polyclonal IgG 
(1:5,000; LI-COR Biosciences) or anti–rabbit 
IgG nanobody TP897 (10 nM). Blots were 
analyzed with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging 
System (LI-COR Biosciences). (b) Left: A two-
fold dilution series of HeLa cell lysate was ana-
lyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The

sciences) or anti–mouse IgG1 Fc nanobody 
TP1107 (5 nM). Right: A twofold dilution se-
ries of Xenopus egg extract was blotted and

nM), anti–mouse IgG1 Fc nanobody TP1107 
(5 nM), anti–mouse IgG1 Fab nanobody 
TP886 (5 nM), anti–mouse κ chain nano-
body TP1170 (2.5 nM), or a combination of 
TP1107 and TP886 or TP1107 and TP1170.

dilution series of filamentous bacteriophages 
was blotted and probed with an anti–minor

goat anti-mouse polyclonal IgG (2.5 nM) or 
anti–mouse κ chain nanobody TP1170 (2.5 
nM). (d) Dual-color Western blotting. A twofold 
dilution series of Xenopus egg extract was blot-
ted and probed with anti-Nup62 mouse IgG1 
mAb A225 and rabbit anti-Nup54 polyclonal 
antibody. These primary antibodies were then 
detected via IRDye 800–labeled goat anti–
rabbit polyclonal IgG and IRDye 680–labeled 
goat anti–mouse polyclonal IgG. Alternatively, 
they were detected with TP1107 coupled to 
IRDye 680 and TP897 coupled to IRDye 800.

immunofluorescence. For this, cells are incubated sequentially 
with primary and secondary antibodies with intervening wash-
ing steps. Fluorophore-linked polyclonal secondary antibodies 
are routinely used for detection, because they can bind primary 
antibodies at multiple sites and thus deliver many fluorophores 
to enable large signal amplification. In contrast, individual anti- 
IgG nanobodies target only a single epitope per antibody (or 
two for symmetric binding sites), and we therefore expected 
only modest signal amplification.
Strikingly, however, the anti-IgG1 nanobodies TP886 and 
TP1107, which specifically target IgG1 Fab and Fc fragment, re-
spectively, not only performed well in Western blotting, but also 
were well-behaved imaging reagents. For maximum brightness, 
we labeled these nanobodies with two to three fluorophores 
each at defined cysteines (Pleiner et al., 2015) and used them 
individually for the detection of mouse IgG1 mAbs in indirect 
HeLa cell immunostaining (Fig. 4 a). Surprisingly, both were 
only slightly dimmer than the polyclonal mixture of anti-mouse 
secondary antibodies. We assume that the excellent nanobody 
signal is also attributable to less steric hindrance compared with 
the much larger conventional secondary antibody. When both 
nanobodies were used in combination, we detected increased 
signal strengths that often were directly comparable to those 
obtained with the secondary antibody (e.g., for Vimentin or 
Ki-67; see also Fig. S4 a). Importantly, despite a high labeling 
density with (the always somewhat sticky) fluorophores, we ob-
served no detectable background staining with these anti-IgG 
nanobodies. This probably relates to the fact that the affinity 
of our nanobodies is very high, which allows their use at rather 
low nanomolar concentrations. The poor performance of the 
first anti-IgG nanobody generation indeed suggests that such 
an excellent signal-to-noise ratio is not a trivial feature for a 
monovalent detection reagent.
For the detection of IgG2a subclass mAbs, we used a 
combination of two nanobodies, TP1129 and TP1170 (Figs. 
4 b and S4 b). The IgG2a-specific nanobody TP1129 targets 
an epitope on the Fc fragment and was obtained after affinity 
maturation of a lower-affinity precursor (Fig. S4 c). Likewise, 
the κ chain–specific nanobody TP1170 is an affinity-optimized 
variant, obtained after error-prone PCR, DNA shuffling, and 
affinity selection (Fig. S4 d). TP1170 also proved effective in 
combination with the anti–IgG1 Fc nanobody TP1107 for the 
detection of IgG1 κ mAbs (Fig. S4, e and f). The anti–rabbit 
IgG Fc nanobody TP897 can be used for the detection of poly-
clonal and monoclonal rabbit IgG (Fig. 4 c).
The nanobodies presented are specific for their respec-
tive IgG subclass, as shown in the specificity profiling dot blot 
assay (Fig. 1 b). We exploited this for multicolor imaging of 
HeLa cells with different IgG subclasses (Fig. 4 d). Mouse 
IgG1–, mouse IgG2a–, and rabbit IgG–specific nanobodies 
did not show any cross reaction and consequently allowed 
for clean colocalization experiments. Even triple colocaliza-
tions were readily possible.
Rapid one-step immunostaining and 
colocalization
The main reasons for separate incubation steps of primary and 
secondary IgGs in indirect immunofluorescence and Western 
blotting are the large size, as well as the bivalent and poly-
clonal nature, of conventional secondary antibodies. If primary 
and secondary antibodies are preincubated, large oligomeric 
complexes form, which in immunofluorescence cannot easily 
penetrate into cells to reach their target and thus create back-
ground and poor signal (Fig. 5 a). In contrast, anti-IgG nano-
bodies are monovalent and therefore do not cross-link primary 
antibodies. This allows streamlining of the conventional immu-
nostaining procedure to a single step. The primary antibodies 
are simply preincubated with fluorescently labeled anti-IgG na-
nobodies and applied to cells together. After washing, the cells 
can be directly mounted for imaging.
In such a workflow, anti-IgG nanobodies perform ex-
ceptionally well (Fig. 5 a). This time-saving protocol is also 
suitable for colocalization studies combining mouse and rabbit 
IgGs or combining mouse mAbs of different subclasses. If the 
off-rate of the IgG prebound nanobodies were negligible over 
the staining period, then an exchange between the different pre-
formed complexes would also be negligible. This would also 
make it unnecessary to use different IgG subclasses for multi-
color imaging. We thus tested a multicolor staining workflow 
of HeLa cells, relying solely on IgG1 subclass mAbs (Fig. 5 b). 
For this, we labeled anti-IgG1 Fc nanobody TP1107 with Alexa 
Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 568, or Alexa Fluor 647 maleimide and 
preincubated it with different IgG1 mAbs. The separately pre-
incubated mixes were then combined and applied to HeLa cells 
for staining in one step. Strikingly, we obtained clean dual and 
even triple colocalizations. To preclude an intermixing of col-
ors, unlabeled TP1107 can be added in excess to the final mix, 
and cells can be postfixed after staining and washing.
Superresolution microscopy with anti-IgG 
nanobodies
Superresolution fluorescence imaging techniques offer the po-
tential for observing subcellular structures at very small (e.g., 
nanometer) scales (Bates et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2010; Sahl 
et al., 2017). However, these methods present new challenges 
for fluorescent labeling, because the spatial resolution of the 
images is comparable to the physical size of the probes. In the 
case of conventional antibodies, the antibody size is on the 
order of 10–15 nm, which may lead to a significant offset dis-
tance between the fluorophore and the epitope. This offset may 
complicate the interpretation of superresolution fluorescence 
image data and make it impossible to take full advantage of the 
increased resolution of the microscope.
Therefore, we reasoned that anti-Fab fragment or anti–κ 
light chain nanobodies should be ideal imaging reagents for 
superresolution microscopy, as they would enable small label 
displacement when used in conjunction with conventional 
primary antibodies. This would be essentially comparable to 
using directly labeled Fab fragments of primary antibodies, 
without any extra work. To test this, we imaged microtubules 
of BS-C-1 cells using a STO 
RM microscope (Rust et al., 
2006; Bates et al., 2007; Fig. 6). Bound primary antibodies 
were detected either via Alexa Fluor 647–labeled polyclonal 
anti-mouse secondary antibodies or anti–mouse κ chain nano-
body TP1170, and the resulting STO 
RM images had a resolu-
tion of ∼20 nm. We selected straight regions of microtubule 
filaments in the images, and calculated the summed histogram 
of the localizations along the axis orthogonal to the filament 
axis. Fitting a Gaussian function to each histogram yielded 
a measure of the filament width. The distribution of widths 
measured for the two samples is shown in Fig. 6 b. In line with 
our initial expectations, we observed a striking difference in 
the microtubules’ apparent width for the two images. Micro-
tubules stained via the polyclonal secondary antibody showed

mouse IgG1 κ mAbs. These primary antibodies were then detected with Alexa Fluor 488–labeled goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody, anti–mouse IgG1 
Fab nanobody TP886, or anti–mouse IgG1 Fc nanobody TP1107. A combination of TP886 and TP1107 yielded increased staining intensities. Laser 
intensities used to acquire the anti-IgG nanobody images were normalized to the intensity used to acquire the anti-mouse polyclonal antibody image (RLI, 
relative laser intensity used for excitation under otherwise identical settings serves as a measure of fluorescence signal strength). (b) Immunofluorescence

a median width of ∼59.5 nm, which is in good agreement 
with EM studies of antibody-coated microtubules (Weber et 
al., 1978) and previous STO 
RM imaging (Bates et al., 2007). 
In contrast, staining with the anti–κ chain nanobody yielded 
microtubules with a width of 37.5 nm, a remarkable ∼22-nm 
reduction as a result of much lower label displacement com-
pared with the polyclonal secondary antibody.
This result demonstrates, therefore, not only the signifi-
cant offsets between epitope and fluorophore that may arise in 
conventional indirect immunostaining, but also the advantage 
of the smaller nanobody probe. Detection via the anti–κ chain 
nanobody resulted in an image that more closely reflects the 
actual structure of the sample, suggesting its use as a superior 
secondary antibody for any superresolution microscopy involv-
ing primary mouse antibodies.
Discussion
Because of the absence of more sustainable alternatives in the 
past, the great usefulness of polyclonal secondary antibodies in 
basic research certainly justified their animal-based production. 
However, to guarantee their constant supply to an ever-growing 
market, the producing companies had to dramatically increase 
their livestock, aim for very high antibody titers using aggres-
sive hyperimmunization strategies causing strong side effects, 
and increase the frequency and volume of collected bleedings. 
It is therefore not surprising that the industrial scale production 
of antibodies has led to severe animal welfare and ethical prob-
lems. The magnitude of these problems recently surfaced in the 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology scandal (Shen, 2013; Reardon, 2016).
Ideally, one could replace all animal immunization by 
selecting binders from synthetic libraries (Gray et al., 2016; 
Moutel et al., 2016; McMahon et al., 2017; Zimmermann et 
al., 2017). Yet, with a purely synthetic approach, it is still not 
straightforward to obtain high-affinity binders. Further, the 
synthetic strategy is typically also inferior in terms of binder 
specificity, because it lacks the stringent selection against 
self-reactivity that happens in antigen-exposed animals. The 
requirement for specificity is particularly high for second-
ary antibodies. We therefore see the approach applied here of 
using an immune library for binder selection as the best possi-
ble compromise. Because it is generally sufficient to obtain a 
few good nanobodies out of a small blood sample containing 
∼100 million lymphocytes, and because we found methods to 
further improve the initial candidates in vitro, there was no need 
for any hyperimmunization aiming at high titers. Importantly, 
once ideal nanobodies are identified, they are defined by their 
sequence and can be renewably produced in E. coli at constant 
quality and without further animal involvement. Because poly-
clonal secondary antibody production accounts for the largest 
share of immunized animals in the world, the anti-IgG nano-
bodies described in this study have the potential to make a great 
step forward toward reducing animal use and further contribute 
to a future of standardized recombinant antibodies (Marx, 2013; 
Bradbury and Plückthun, 2015a,b).
We expect that our anti-IgG nanobodies will replace poly-
clonal secondary antibodies in many of their applications, for 
instance, in Western blotting and immunofluorescence. For 
both applications, their site-specific and quantitative modifica-
tion with fluorophores via maleimide chemistry creates superior 
reagents with predictable label density and position (Pleiner et 
al., 2015). Furthermore, the precise targeting of primary mouse 
antibodies at the κ chain with a specific nanobody can substan-
tially reduce label displacement in superresolution microscopy. 
In the future, we will also explore the direct coupling of anti-IgG 
nanobodies with engineered cysteines onto colloidal gold parti-
cles for electron microscopy, which also suffers from the large 
linkage error introduced by bulky secondary antibodies.
Because of their monovalent and monoclonal nature, an-
ti-IgG nanobodies do not cross-link primary antibodies, and 
we exploited this for a one-step immunostaining workflow that 
saves valuable hands-on time and can also be extended to West-
ern blotting. We envision that for routine stainings, preformed 
complexes of primary antibodies and labeled nanobodies can 
be prepared as stock solutions or simply bought from commer-
cial suppliers. Because of the high affinity of the nanobodies 
described, the same strategy also enables multicolor immunos-
tainings based on a single IgG subclass, which could also be 
relevant for flow cytometry sorting of specific cell types. This 
would be a cheaper and more flexible alternative to differen-
tially labeled primary antibodies, it does not pose the risk of 
inactivating an antigen-binding site, and it can easily be done if 
only small amounts of primary antibody are available.
Further, because the DNA sequences of these anti-IgG na-
nobodies are essentially synthetic building blocks, they can be 
genetically appended to the multitude of available tags, fluores-
cent proteins, or enzymes to generate fusion proteins with novel 
functions for tailored applications in basic research and medical 
diagnostics, and also can become valuable tools for immunol-
ogy to study Fc or B cell receptors and downstream signaling 
cascades. Furthermore, anti-IgG nanobodies equipped with pro-
tease-cleavable affinity tags (Pleiner et al., 2015) will allow the 
native isolation of any antibody–target complex, e.g., for struc-
tural studies by cryo-EM or functional assays.
Even though the anti-IgG nanobody toolbox presented 
here is already highly optimized, we will continue to extend 
it by identifying new nanobodies that decorate complementary 
binding sites and thus allow further signal enhancement and 
combining them with additional functional elements. In any 
case, it will be an open resource for all interested laboratories.
Materials and methods
Alpaca immunization
Two female alpacas, held at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical 
Chemistry, were immunized four times with 1.0 mg polyclonal mouse 
or rabbit IgG at 3-wk intervals. The anti-IgG project turned out to be 
the most challenging nanobody project in the laboratory so far, because 
we aimed at an extremely low off-rate for imaging and blotting ap-
plications. We therefore resumed immunizations after a 12-mo (rabbit 
or anti–rabbit IgG nanobody TP897. (d) Multicolor staining of HeLa cells. HeLa cells were incubated with the indicated mouse IgG1, mouse IgG2a, or

anti–rabbit IgG nanobody TP897, respectively, labeled with the indicated Alexa Fluor dyes. The top two panels show dual colocalization, and the bottom 
panel shows a triple colocalization.

IgG) or 8-mo (mouse IgG) break. Nanobodies obtained after these late 
immunizations still showed very clear phage enrichment (>1,000-fold) 
even with femtomolar concentrations of the IgG baits. We therefore 
assume that they have very high affinity.
Selection of anti-IgG nanobodies
The generation of nanobody immune libraries and the selection of an-
tigen-specific nanobodies by phage display from these libraries were 
performed as previously described (Pleiner et al., 2015). IgG was bi-
otinylated at accessible lysines by addition of a 4× molar excess of 
NHS-PEG12-biotin (from a 20-mM stock in dimethylformamide; Iris 
Biotech) for 2 h at room temperature in 1× PBS. The reaction was 
quenched, and the excess of unreacted biotin was separated from bi-
otinylated IgG via buffer exchange into 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 
300 mM NaCl using PD-10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare).
Expression and purification of untagged nanobodies
Bacterial expression plasmids for selected anti-IgG nanobodies will 
be distributed via Addgene under the IDs 104157–104164. The pro-
tein sequences of all nanobodies are listed in Table S1. Nanobodies 
with engineered cysteines were expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli 
NEB express F′ (New England Biolabs). A 50-ml preculture (2YT 
medium containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin) was grown overnight at 
28°C. The culture was then diluted with fresh medium to 250 ml. 
After 1 h of growth at 25°C, protein expression was induced for 
3–5 h by adding 0.2 mM IPTG. After addition of 1 mM PMSF to 
the culture, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended 
in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM im-
idazole, and 5 mM DTT), and lysed by sonication. The lysate was 
cleared by ultracentrifugation for 1.5 h (T647.5 rotor, 38,000 rpm; 
Sorvall) at 4°C. Nanobodies with engineered cysteines carried an 
N-terminal His14-bdNEDD8-tag and were affinity-purified via Ni2+ 
chelate affinity chromatography. After washing with two column vol-
umes (CV) of lysis buffer and one CV of maleimide-labeling buffer 
(MLB: 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 
250 mM sucrose), untagged nanobodies were eluted by on-column 
cleavage with 500 nM untagged bdNEDP1 protease (expression 
construct pDG02583: Addgene ID 104129; see section Expression 
of bdNEDP1 protease from pDG02583; Frey and Görlich, 2014) in 
maleimide-labeling buffer for 45 min at 4°C and labeled immedi-
ately with fluorophores.
Alternatively, nanobodies can be eluted with lysis buffer con-
taining 500 mM imidazole and after buffer exchange to MLB (plus 
10 mM imidazole) using PD-10 desalting columns cleaved for 1 h at 
4°C in solution with 300 nM His14-MBP-bdSUMO-tagged bdNEDP1 
protease. The His14-bdNEDD8 tag and the His14-tagged protease can 
then be removed by another incubation with Ni2+ chelate affinity resin 
(reverse nickel chromatography). The unbound fraction will contain 
untagged nanobodies. For longer storage, 10 mM DTT or TCEP 
and 1 mM EDTA were included in the maleimide-labeling buffer 
to keep cysteines reduced. Purified nanobodies were aliquoted and 
frozen in liquid nitrogen.

of Alexa Fluor 488–labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody or a combination of anti–mouse IgG1 Fab nanobody TP886 and anti–mouse IgG1 Fc

antibody or anti–rabbit IgG nanobody TP897. The resulting mixes were then applied to fixed and blocked HeLa cells. After washing, the cells were directly 
mounted for imaging. For every primary antibody, images were acquired under identical settings, and pixel intensities are represented via a false-color 
lookup table. (b) Multicolor staining of HeLa cells with mouse IgG1 subclass mAbs. The indicated mouse IgG1 mAbs were separately preincubated with

single step. Washed cells were directly mounted for imaging.

Expression of bdNEDP1 protease from pDG02583
For expression of the previously described bdNEDP1 protease (Frey and 
Görlich, 2014), we used here an optimized construct encoding a His14-
MBP-bdSUMO-bdNEDP1 fusion (pDG02583). The MBP-bdSUMO 
module enhances soluble expression. The plasmid was transformed 
into E. coli NEB express F′. An 80-ml preculture (TB medium contain-
ing 50 µg/ml kanamycin) was grown at 28°C in a 5-liter flask overnight. 
The culture was then diluted with fresh medium to 700 ml. After 1-h 
growth at 25°C, protein expression was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG at 
OD600 ∼2.0 for 5 h. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer 
(50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole/HCl, pH 
7.5, 10 mM DTT, and 250 mM sucrose), lysed by sonication, and ul-
tracentrifuged. The supernatant was bound to a Ni2+-chelate resin, the 
column was thoroughly washed, and the fusion was eluted with lysis 
buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The eluate was then rebuffered to 
50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM sucrose, and 10 mM 
DTT. This yields a His14-tagged bdNEDP1 version that can be used for 
in-solution digests of His14-bdNEDD8-nanobody fusions, followed by 
reverse Ni chromatography to remove tag and protease.
Alternatively, the protease can be used for on-column cleavage 
and thus for a direct production of tag-free nanobodies (Pleiner et al., 
2015). This protocol requires prior removal of the His-tag from the pro-
tease. For this, we added 100 nM His14-bdSENP1 protease and 0.2% 
Tween-80 to the imidazole-eluted His14-MBP-bdSUMO-bdNEDP1 
protease and incubated the mixture for 1 h at room temperature or over-
night at 4°C. During this time, the buffer is exchanged for degassed 
50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 10 mM DTT by either 
gel filtration on Sephadex G25 (e.g., on a PD-10 column) or dialysis. 
Any aggregates were removed by ultracentrifugation, and the sample 
was applied to reverse Ni chromatography, which captures the cleaved 
His14-MBP-bdSUMO tag, the added His14-tagged bdSENP1 prote-
ase, and any Ni-binding contaminants from the initial bacterial lysate. 
The flow-through fraction was collected, and the combined pool was 
supplemented with 250 mM sucrose. The protease concentration was 
determined by reading the 280-nm absorbance (ε280 = 28,000 M/cm), 
and the tag-free protease was snap-frozen in small aliquots and stored 
at −80°C for further use. The reason for using NEDD8 as a protease 
module is that it greatly enhances the soluble expression of nanobodies 
(Pleiner et al., 2015). Moreover, bdNEDP1 is a far more efficient prote-
ase than the still more commonly used Tev protease (Frey and Görlich, 
2014), allowing complete substrate cleavage with nanomolar protease 
concentrations within only 1 h on ice.
Expression and purification of the His14-bdSENP1 helper prote-
ase was described previously (Frey and Görlich, 2014). The expression 
construct (pSF1389) is also available through Addgene (ID 104962).
Site-specific fluorescent labeling of nanobodies with engineered 
cysteines
The fluorescent labeling of nanobodies with maleimide dyes was de-
scribed in detail (Pleiner et al., 2015). In brief, stored nanobodies were 
thawed, and the buffer was exchanged again to maleimide-labeling 
buffer to remove the reducing agent, using either Illustra NAP-5 or 
PD-10 desalting columns. For a standard labeling reaction, 5–10 nmol 
nanobody was rapidly mixed with 1.2× molar excess of fluorescent 
dye per cysteine on the nanobody and incubated for 1.5 h on ice. Free 
dye was separated from labeled nanobody by buffer exchange to ma-
leimide-labeling buffer on Illustra NAP-5 or PD-10 desalting columns. 
Quantitative labeling was quality controlled by calculating the degree 
of labeling. Fluorescently labeled nanobodies were always aliquoted, 
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until further use.
Dot blot assay for anti-IgG nanobody specificity profiling
To profile the binding of anti-IgG nanobodies to different IgG sub-
classes and analyze their cross reaction to IgG from other species, a 
dot blot assay was performed. Nitrocellulose membrane was cut in 
strips, and different IgGs (500 ng for polyclonal total IgG, Fab, and Fc 
fragments; ∼250 ng for monoclonal IgG in 1 µl) were spotted. Strips 
were blocked with 4% milk (wt/vol) in 1× PBS for 30 min at room

First, the two labeling approaches are illustrated on the left

lustrate the results of the width analysis (boxes indicate first

90th percentiles). In these measurements, the median width 
of the tubulin filaments decreased by a significant amount 
(from 59.5 to 37.5 nm) when stained with the anti–mouse 
κ chain nanobody TP1170.

temperature. Nanobodies were added at ∼300 nM in 1 ml milk for 30 
min. After washing two times with 1× PBS for 10 min each, bound 
nanobodies were detected at 488 nm in a fluorescence scanner (Star-
ion FLA-9000; Fujifilm). The following IgGs were used: IgG1 κ mAb 
A225 (Cordes et al., 1995); IgG1 λ (#010-001-331; Rockland); IgG2a κ 
(02-6200; Thermo Fisher Scientific); IgG2b κ (02-6300; Thermo Fisher 
Scientific); IgG3 κ (401302; BioLegend); polyclonal IgG Fab frag-
ments (010-0105; Rockland); and polyclonal IgG Fc fragments (31205; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Polyclonal IgG of the following species 
were used: rabbit (made in-house, affinity-purified from serum); mouse 
(I8765); rat (I4131); goat (I5256); sheep (I5131); human (I4506; all 
Sigma-Aldrich); and guinea pig (CR4-10; Sino Biological).
Native isolation of IgG with anti-IgG nanobodies
Polyclonal rabbit IgG from serum or mouse mAbs from hybridoma 
cell culture supernatant were isolated natively with anti-IgG nanobod-
ies. For this, 0.3 nmol biotinylated nanobodies carrying an N-termi-
nal His14-Biotin acceptor peptide-(GlySer)9-SUM 
OStar-(GlySer)9-tag 
were immobilized on 1 mg magnetic Dynabeads MyOne Streptavi-
din T1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Excess biotin binding sites were 
quenched with biotin-PEG-COOH (PEG1053; Iris Biotech). The 
beads were incubated with 1 ml precleared (10 min, 16,000 g at 4°C) 
serum or hybridoma supernatant for 30 min at 4°C. After washing two 
times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl and 300 mM NaCl), nano-
body-bound IgG was eluted by addition of 50 µl of 0.5-µM SUM 
OStar 
protease (Liu et al., 2008) in wash buffer for 20 min on ice. An aliquot 
of the eluate was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.
Western blotting
Bacteriophage protein III was detected with a mouse anti-pIII IgG2a 
mAb (#E8033S; New England Biolabs). Mouse mAbs used for detec-
tion of human proteins in HeLa cell lysate were as follows: anti-Skp1 
(clone H-6, sc-5281; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti–α-tubulin (clone 
DM1A, T6199; Sigma-Aldrich), and anti–Histone H3 (clone 96C10, 
3638; Cell Signaling Technologies). Polyclonal goat anti–mouse IgG 
coupled to IRDye 800CW (925-32210; LI-COR Biosciences) was used 
to detect primary mouse antibodies at a dilution of 1:1,340 (5 nM). 
Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against Xenopus nucleoporins Nup98, 
Nup93, Nup54, Nup88, and Nup107 were prepared in the laboratory 
(Hülsmann et al., 2012). Polyclonal goat anti–rabbit IgG coupled to 
IRDye 800CW (925-32211; LI-COR Biosciences) was used to detect 
primary rabbit antibodies at the lowest suggested dilution of 1:5,000. 
Anti–mouse IgG1 Fab nanobody TP886 (5 nM), anti–mouse IgG1 Fc 
nanobody TP1107 (5 nM), and anti–rabbit IgG nanobody TP897 (10 
nM) were labeled with a single IRDye 800CW maleimide (929-80020; 
LI-COR Biosciences) via a C-terminal cysteine and used at the indi-
cated concentrations in 4% (wt/vol) milk in 1× PBS.
Polyclonal goat anti-mouse–HRP conjugate was obtained from 
DakoCytomation and used at 1:1,000 dilution (5 nM). Anti–mouse 
IgG1 Fc nanobody TP1107 was conjugated to maleimide-activated 
HRP (31485; Thermo Fisher Scientific) via a C-terminal cysteine by 
mixing both in equimolar amounts and incubating for 1 h at room 
temperature. The conjugate was used at 5 nM in 4% (wt/vol) milk in 
1× PBS. The ECL solution was made in-house and contained 5 mM 
Luminol (A4685; Sigma-Aldrich), 0.81 mM 4-iodophenylboronic 
acid (471933; Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 mM of freshly added H2O2 in 
0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.8.
Amplex Ultra Red assay
APEX2 was derived from pTRC-APEX2 (plasmid 72558; Addgene), 
which was a gift from A.Y. Ting (Stanford University, Stanford, 
CA; Lam et al., 2015). The anti–mouse IgG1 Fc nanobody TP1107-
APEX2 fusion was expressed from pTP1135 with an N-terminal His14-
bdNEDD8-tag in E. coli NEB express F′ (New England Biolabs) for 
6 h at 25°C in the presence of 1 mM heme precursor 5-aminolevulinic 
acid (A3785; Sigma-Aldrich). After lysis, the protein was purified by 
nickel chelate affinity chromatography and eluted by cleavage with 500 
nM bdNEDP1 protease (Frey and Görlich, 2014) in 100 mM potas-
sium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 250 mM sucrose. The 
final assay mix contained 160 µM Amplex Ultra Red and 160 µM H2O2 
in either 100 mM citrate, pH 6.6, and 150 mM NaCl (optimal pH for 
APEX2) or 100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, and 150 mM NaCl 
(optimal pH for HRP). 50 µl of this mix was used per reaction. Anti–
mouse IgG1 Fc nanobody TP1107-APEX2 was titrated from 167 nM 
to 470 fM in a 1.8-fold dilution series, and 2 µl of each dilution was 
added to 50 µl reaction mix in triplicate. HRP (31490; Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) was titrated from 31 nM to 5 fM in a 2.4-fold dilution se-
ries, and 2 µl per dilution was added to 50 µl reaction mix in triplicate. 
The 96-well plate containing these reactions was incubated at room 
temperature for 30 min, and resorufin fluorescence was measured at 
590 nm (530-nm excitation) in a Bio-Tek Synergy HT Multi-Detection 
Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments).
Immunofluorescence
HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed for 10 min at room 
temperature with 3% (wt/vol) PFA and washed two times with 1× PBS 
for 5 min each. Residual PFA was quenched by incubation with 50 mM 
NH4Cl in 1× PBS for 5 min. After two washes with 1× PBS for 5 min 
each, the cells were permeabilized with 0.3% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 
for 3 min. Then the cells were washed three times quickly with 1× PBS 
and blocked for 30 min with 1% (wt/vol) BSA in 1× PBS (blocking 
buffer). After blocking, the coverslips were stained with primary an-
tibody, which was diluted in blocking buffer, in a humid chamber for 
1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were then washed two times 
in 1× PBS for 15 min each and added again to a humid chamber for 
incubation with secondary antibody or anti-IgG nanobody diluted in 
blocking buffer. Afterward, the cells were washed two times in 1× PBS 
for 15 min each, and the coverslips were mounted with Slow Fade Gold 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) for imaging on a TCS SP5 confocal micro-
scope equipped with hybrid detectors (Leica).
For methanol fixation, the cells were incubated with 
−20°C-cooled methanol for 6 min at room temperature, washed two 
times in 1× PBS for 5 min each, and blocked in blocking buffer. The 
staining was performed as described in the previous paragraph.
Antibodies for immunofluorescence
The following rabbit antibodies were used for immunofluorescence on 
HeLa cells: anti-Lap2 polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution; 14651-1-
AP; Proteintech); anti-Ki-67 mAb clone D3B5 (1:200 dilution; 9129; 
Cell Signaling Technologies). The following mouse mAbs were used 
for immunofluorescence on HeLa cells: anti-Vimentin mAb clone V9 
(1:10 dilution of hybridoma supernatant; gift of M. Osborn, Max Planck 
Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany); anti–Ki-67 
mAb clone B56 (1:50 dilution; 556003; BD Biosciences); anti-TPR 
mAb 203-37 (1:500 dilution; Matritech; Cordes et al., 1997); anti–cyto-
chrome c mAb clone 6H2.B4 (1:50 dilution; 556432; BD Biosciences); 
anti–lamin A/C mAb clone 4C11 (1:50 dilution; 4777T; Cell Signaling 
Technologies); and anti-CD44 mAb clone 156-3C11 (1:200 dilution; 
3570T; Cell Signaling Technologies). Polyclonal goat anti–rabbit IgG 
(111-545-003) and goat anti–mouse IgG (115-545-003; Jackson Im-
munoResearch) coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 were used as secondary 
antibodies at 1:150 dilution (∼33 nM). Anti-IgG nanobodies were la-
beled with maleimide Alexa Fluor dyes at engineered surface cysteines 
(Pleiner et al., 2015) and used at 20 nM. The nanobodies used had the

RM imaging of microtubules in BS-C-1 cells
BS-C-1 cells (CCL-26; ATC–) were stained with an anti-α tubulin

PFA fixation as described in the Immunofluorescence section for HeLa

RM imaging was performed using a custom-built microscope, 
similar to what has been described previously (Bates et al., 2012). In 
brief, 642 nm laser light was used to illuminate the sample, and fluo-
rescence was detected with an EMC 
CD camera (Andor Ixon DU860), 
after filtering with a bandpass filter (ET700/75; Chroma Technologies). 
Raw STO 
RM data were analyzed with custom-written software, and 
STO 
RM images of each sample were rendered using summed Gauss-
ian functions. For calculation of the cross-section histograms, multiple 
straight segments of tubulin filaments were selected from the STO 
RM 
images. For each straight filament segment, a line was laid over the 
segment to define the filament axis. Next, a set of rectangular regions 
of interest (ROIs) was created, aligned with the segment and spanning 
the cross section of the filament. The ROI length was set equal to the 
segment length and a user-selectable ROI width, which was chosen to 
be 5 nm for this analysis (the bin width). By counting the number of 
localizations falling within each ROI, a histogram corresponding to the 
cross-sectional profile of the STO 
RM image of a filament, averaged 
along the segment length, was generated. To measure the width of the 
cross section, a Gaussian function was fitted to the histogram, and the 
full width at half-maximum was calculated. The distribution of measured 
filament widths is shown in Fig. 6 b.
