Abstract
Problem/Condition: Drug overdoses are a leading cause of injury death in the United States, resulting in approximately 52,000 deaths 
in 2015. Understanding differences in illicit drug use, illicit drug use disorders, and overall drug overdose deaths in metropolitan and 
nonmetropolitan areas is important for informing public health programs, interventions, and policies.
Reporting Period: Illicit drug use and drug use disorders during 2003–2014, and drug overdose deaths during 1999–2015.
Description of Data: The National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) collects information through face-to-face household 
interviews about the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among the U.S. noninstitutionalized civilian population aged ≥12 years. 
Respondents include residents of households and noninstitutional group quarters (e.g., shelters, rooming houses, dormitories, 
migratory workers’ camps, and halfway houses) and civilians living on military bases. NSDUH variables include sex, age, race/
ethnicity, residence (metropolitan/nonmetropolitan), annual household income, self-reported drug use, and drug use disorders.
National Vital Statistics System Mortality (NVSS-M) data for U.S. residents include information from death certificates filed in the 
50 states and the District of Columbia. Cases were selected with an underlying cause of death based on the ICD-10 codes for drug 
overdoses (X40–X44, X60–X64, X85, and Y10–Y14). NVSS-M variables include decedent characteristics (sex, age, and race/ethnicity) 
and information on intent (unintentional, suicide, homicide, or undetermined), location of death (medical facility, in a home, or 
other [including nursing homes, hospices, unknown, and other locations]) and county of residence (metropolitan/nonmetropolitan).
Metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status is assigned independently in each data system. NSDUH uses a three-category system: Core 
Based Statistical Area (CBSA) of ≥1 million persons; CBSA of <1 million persons; and not a CBSA, which for simplicity were 
labeled large metropolitan, small metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan. Deaths from NVSS-M are categorized by the county of 
residence of the decedent using CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics 2013 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme, collapsed 
into two categories (metropolitan and nonmetropolitan).
Results: Although both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas experienced significant increases from 2003–2005 to 2012–2014 
in self-reported past-month use of illicit drugs, the prevalence was highest for the large metropolitan areas compared with small 
metropolitan or nonmetropolitan areas throughout the study period. Notably, past-month use of illicit drugs declined over the 
study period for the youngest respondents (aged 12–17 years). The prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorders among persons 
using illicit drugs in the past year varied by metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status and changed over time. Across both metropolitan 
and nonmetropolitan areas, the prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorders declined during 2003–2014.
In 2015, approximately six times as many drug overdose deaths occurred in metropolitan areas than occurred in nonmetropolitan 
areas (metropolitan: 45,059; nonmetropolitan: 7,345). Drug overdose death rates (per 100,000 population) for metropolitan 
areas were higher than in nonmetropolitan areas in 1999 (6.4 versus 4.0), however, the rates converged in 2004, and by 2015, 
the nonmetropolitan rate (17.0) was slightly higher than the metropolitan rate (16.2).
Interpretation: Drug use and subsequent overdoses continue to be a critical and complicated public health challenge across 
metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas. The decline in illicit drug use by youth and the lower prevalence of illicit drug use disorders 
in rural areas during 2012–2014 are encouraging signs. However, the increasing rate of drug overdose deaths in rural areas, which 
surpassed rates in urban areas, is cause for concern.
Public Health Actions: Understanding the differences between 
metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas in drug use, drug use 
disorders, and drug overdose deaths can help public health 
professionals to identify, monitor, and prioritize responses.

Consideration of where persons live and where they die from overdose could enhance specific overdose prevention interventions, 
such as training on naloxone administration or rescue breathing. Educating prescribers on CDC’s guideline for prescribing opioids 
for chronic pain (Dowell D, Haegerich TM, Chou R. CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain—United States, 
2016. MMWR Recomm Rep 2016;66[No. RR-1]) and facilitating better access to medication-assisted treatment with methadone, 
buprenorphine, or naltrexone could benefit communities with high opioid use disorder rates.
Introduction
During 1999–2014, annual age-adjusted death rates for the 
five leading causes of death in the United States (heart disease, 
cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease, 
and stroke) were higher in rural (nonmetropolitan) areas than 
in urban (metropolitan) areas (1). Many factors influence 
the rural-urban mortality gap, including socioeconomic 
differences, health-related behaviors, and access to health care 
services. Residents of rural areas in the United States tend to 
be poorer and sicker than their urban counterparts, with rural 
residents in the South and West experiencing some of the most 
adverse health outcome (2).
In each year during 1999–2015, all-cause injury death rates 
were higher in nonmetropolitan areas of the United States 
than they were in metropolitan areas (3), and previous studies 
indicate that rates of drug overdose death and drug use varied 
markedly by metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status (4–6). Drug 
overdoses are now the leading cause of injury death in the 
United States, and although prescription drugs were primarily 
responsible for the rapid expansion of this large and growing 
public health crisis, illicit drugs (heroin, illicit fentanyl, cocaine, 
and methamphetamines) now are contributing substantially to 
the problem (7). Age-adjusted death rates for drug overdoses 
varied by the drug involved and the level of urbanization. 
For example, natural and semisynthetic opioid-related drug 
overdose death rates were highest and heroin-related drug 
overdose death rates were lowest in nonmetropolitan areas in 
2015 compared with other levels of urbanicity (7).
A growing body of literature describes various aspects of 
the drug overdose epidemic and population density (4,6,8,9). 
Risk factors within metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status are 
a complicated mix of type of drug used (licit versus illicit), 
recreational versus pharmaceutical use, the combinations of 
drugs used, routes of administration (e.g., injection versus 
oral administration), the amount of drugs prescribed, the 
place used (home versus community), knowledge of potential 
adverse outcomes, access to overdose reversal drugs, and access 
to emergency services and substance abuse treatment services.
This report examines trends in drug use, drug use disorders, 
and overdose deaths in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan 
areas of the United States through analyses of 2003–2014 
National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data 
and 1999–2015 National Vital Statistics System Mortality 
(NVSS-M) data. Public health professionals and clinicians 
can use these findings to identify specific subgroups and rural/
urban groups in need of targeted interventions.
Methods
Data Sources
Drug use and drug use disorder data were from the 
2003–2014 NSDUH, which is managed by the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s Center 
for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (https://www.
samhsa.gov/data/population-data-nsduh). NSDUH collects 
information through face-to-face household interviews 
about the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among 
the U.S. noninstitutionalized civilian population aged 
≥12 years. Respondents include residents of households 
and noninstitutional group quarters (e.g., shelters, rooming 
houses, dormitories, migratory workers’ camps, and halfway 
houses) and civilians living on military bases. An independent, 
multistage area probability sample design for each of the 50 
states and the District of Columbia allows for the production 
of state-level and urban status (county of residence) estimates.
Mortality data for U.S. residents were from the 1999–2015 
NVSS-M, which is based on information from all death 
certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
Deaths of nonresidents (e.g., nonresident aliens; nationals 
living abroad; and residents of Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, and other U.S. territories) were excluded. 
Mortality data are provided to CDC’s National Center 
for Health Statistics (NCHS) through the Vital Statistics 
Cooperative Program and coded according to the International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) by NCHS. 
Analyses were restricted to deaths with an underlying cause of 
death based on the ICD-10 codes for drug overdoses (X40–
X44, X60–X64, X85, and Y10–Y14) (10).
Variables
NSDUH variables included sex, age, race/ethnicity, 
residence (metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area), annual 
household income, self-reported drug use, and drug use

disorders. Metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status was coded 
using NSDUH’s Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) measure, 
which was available across the study period. This measure 
uses three segments of population density: CBSA with 
population of ≥1 million persons (large metropolitan); CBSA 
with population of <1 million persons (small metropolitan); 
and not a CBSA (nonmetropolitan) (11,12). For this report, 
CBSAs with populations ≥1 million persons and <1 million 
persons were considered metropolitan and those classed as “not 
a CBSA” were considered nonmetropolitan.
Self-reported drug use in NSDUH included past-month 
use of illicit drugs (marijuana/hashish, cocaine [including 
crack], inhalants, hallucinogens, or heroin) or nonmedical use 
of prescription-type drugs (opioids, sedatives, tranquilizers, 
and stimulants). The presence of a past-year illicit drug use 
disorder was defined using criteria specified within the 4th 
edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, which include symptoms such as withdrawal, 
tolerance, use in dangerous situations, trouble with the law, and 
interference with major obligations at work, school, or home 
(13). Respondents were asked questions about substance use 
disorders if they had reported use of illicit drugs in the past 
12 months. The full survey instrument is available at http://
www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/studies/36361.
NVSS-M variables included decedent characteristics (sex, age, 
and race/ethnicity) and information on the intent (unintentional, 
suicide, homicide, or undetermined) and location of death 
(medical facility, in a home, or other [including nursing homes, 
hospices, unknown, and other locations], and county of residence 
[metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area]). Location of death might 
be different from location of drug use. NVSS-M suppression 
rules include not reporting cell counts with <10 persons and rates 
are considered unreliable for <20 deaths. Deaths were categorized 
as metropolitan or nonmetropolitan based on the county 
of residence. Nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas were 
identified using the NCHS 2013 county-based classification 
scheme (14). The six NCHS classification levels for counties are: 
1) large central metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical
area with ≥1 million population and covers a principal city;
2) large fringe metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical area
with ≥1 million population but does not cover a principal city;
3) medium metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical area
with ≥250,000 but <1 million population; 4) small metropolitan: 
part of a metropolitan statistical area with <250,000 population; 
5) micropolitan (nonmetropolitan): part of a micropolitan
statistical area (has an urban cluster of ≥10,000 but <50,000
population); and 6) noncore (nonmetropolitan): not part of a
metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area. For a dichotomous 
measure, metropolitan (urban) combines categories 1–4 and
nonmetropolitan (rural) combines 5 and 6.
Data Analysis
On the basis of NSDUH data, overall prevalence of past-
month illicit drug use was estimated for four 3-year periods 
(2003–2005, 2006–2008, 2009–2011, and 2012–2014), by 
CBSA designation, sex, age group, race, and annual household 
income. Prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorder among 
persons reporting past-year illicit drug use was calculated by 
large metropolitan, small metropolitan and nonmetropolitan 
areas for the four periods, overall, and by sex. Estimates were 
weighted based on the complex sample design and sampling 
weights of the NSDUH. Years were pooled to improve 
the precision of estimates and enable comparisons across 
subgroups. Logistic regression models (presence of drug use 
or drug use disorder) tested p-values of beta coefficients of the 
year variable to assess statistically significant (p <0.05) changes 
in trends. Percentage change was calculated by comparing the 
early period (2003–2005) with the last period (2012–2014). 
The analysis of trends in age-adjusted death rates during 
1999–2015 included all ages; death rates per 100,000 persons 
were adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population by the 
direct method (10).
Results
National Survey of Drug Use and Health
From 2003–2005 to 2012–2014, the prevalence of past-
month use of illicit drugs was highest in large metropolitan areas 
(Table 1). All three urban status groups (large metropolitan, 
small metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan) experienced 
significant increases in the prevalence of past-month drug use 
overall. Prevalence was higher for males than females during all 
time intervals in all urban status groups. However, in the large 
metropolitan group, the percentage increase in prevalence from 
2003–2005 to 2012–2014 was greater for females (23.4%) 
than for males (21.6%). The prevalence of illicit drug use 
among nonmetropolitan females remained stable during the 
study period.
During 2012–2014, respondents aged 18–25 years had the 
highest prevalence of past-month use of illicit drugs for all urban 
levels (Table 1). For respondents in this age group, the prevalence 
increased slightly from 2003–2005 to 2012–2014 in large 
metropolitan areas (13.8%) while the prevalence remained stable 
among small metropolitan area respondents and nonmetropolitan 
respondents. Past-month use of illicit drugs declined over the study 
period for the youngest respondents (aged 12–17 years), with the 
largest decline among small metropolitan area youth. Past-month 
use of illicit drugs increased significantly among all three urban 
areas among persons aged 26–34 years and those aged ≥35 years.

Prevalence of past-month illicit drug use increased among 
both non-Hispanic whites and other races for both large and 
small metropolitan areas (Table 1). Prevalence did not change 
among non-Hispanic white nonmetropolitan respondents 
nor among nonmetropolitan respondents of other races. 
When past-month illicit drug use was examined by annual 
household income, respondents with an annual household 
income <$20,000 had the highest prevalence across all three 
geographic groups. Persons living in large metropolitan areas 
with a household income of <$20,000 experienced the largest 
increase in past-month illicit drug use during the study period 
(37.6%), followed by nonmetropolitan residents with a 
household income of $20,000–$49,999 (29.8%).
The prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorders among 
persons reporting illicit drug use in the past year varied by 
metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area and sex, and changed 
over time (Figure 1). All three geographic groups experienced 
statistically significant declines in overall prevalence of drug 
use disorders during the study period. For residents in large 
metropolitan areas, prevalence declined 12.6%. For residents 
in small metropolitan areas, prevalence declined 20.7% from 
20.8% during 2003–2005 to 16.5% during 2012–2014. 
Among nonmetropolitan residents, the prevalence of past-year 
illicit drug use disorders decreased 12.8%, from 18.8% during 
2003–2005 to 16.4% during 2012–2014. During 2012–2014, 
prevalence rates were similar across the three geographic groups.
Males who reported illicit drug use in the past year 
consistently had higher prevalence of illicit drug use disorders 
compared with females. In general, females experienced 
consistently larger declines during the study period. The 
prevalence of illicit drug use disorders among females declined 
14.9% among those living in large metropolitan areas, 19.3% 
among those living in small metropolitan areas, and 23.0% 
among nonmetropolitan residents. The prevalence of illicit 
drug use disorders declined significantly in metropolitan areas 
for males and females. The decline in prevalence of illicit drug 
use disorders among nonmetropolitan residents was significant 
overall and for males during the study period.
National Vital Statistics System
In 2015, nearly six times as many drug overdose deaths were 
reported in metropolitan areas than in nonmetropolitan areas 
(metropolitan: 45,059; nonmetropolitan: 7,345) in the United 
States (Table 2). The overall percentage change in the number 
of deaths for nonmetropolitan areas over the time period was 
325% (the percentage change in the age-adjusted death rate 
per 100,000 was 330%; data not reported). Although age-
adjusted drug overdose death rates for metropolitan areas were 
higher than in nonmetropolitan areas in 1999 (6.4 versus 4.0, 
respectively), the rates converged in 2004 (9.4 in both areas), 
and in 2015 the nonmetropolitan rate (17.0) was slightly 
higher than the metropolitan rate (16.2).
The age-adjusted drug overdose death rate for females was 
higher in metropolitan areas during 1999–2003 and higher 
in nonmetropolitan areas thereafter (Table 1). The difference 
in rates (per 100,000 population) between areas was greatest 
in 2015 (metropolitan: 11.5; nonmetropolitan: 14.3). The 
percentage change in the number of drug overdose deaths 
for females increased nearly 350% in nonmetropolitan areas 
during 1999–2015 (the percentage change in the age-adjusted 
death rate per 100,000 persons was 360%). The drug overdose 
death rate for males was higher in metropolitan areas in all 
years except 2010 and 2011 with the largest difference between 
metropolitan and nonmetropolitan rates occurring in 1999 
(metropolitan: 8.8; nonmetropolitan: 4.8).
During 1999–2015, age-adjusted drug overdose death rates 
varied by race/ethnicity and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan 
area. American Indians/Alaska Natives had the highest 
drug overdose death rates in 2015 (metropolitan: 22.1; 
nonmetropolitan: 19.8) and the largest percentage change 
increase in the number of deaths over time (nonmetropolitan: 
519%) (Table 2). During 1999–2001, black decedents in 
metropolitan areas had the highest death rates compared to 
other race/ethnicity categories; the rate for white decedents 
in metropolitan areas was highest in 2002 and 2007, and the 
rate was highest in remaining years for American Indians/
Alaska Natives residing in metropolitan areas. Rates for white 
decedents (metropolitan: 21.4) were similar to American 
Indians/Alaska Natives in 2015. Drug overdose death rates 
were lowest among Asians/Pacific Islanders in all years.
Nonmetropolitan unintentional age-adjusted overdose death 
rates changed from 2.5 in 1999 to 14.2 in 2015 (Table 2). 
Metropolitan unintentional overdose death rates changed from 
4.3 in 1999 to 13.8 in 2015. Rates of suicide overdose deaths 
were similar in metropolitan (1.5) and nonmetropolitan (1.6) 
areas in 2015.
All age group categories showed increases in drug overdose 
deaths from 1999 to 2015 (Table 2). The percentage change 
increase in age-specific drug overdose deaths from 1999 to 
2015 was higher for nonmetropolitan areas than metropolitan 
areas for persons aged ≥12 years, with the largest increase in 
drug overdose deaths (411%) among those aged 18–25 years. 
Nonmetropolitan drug overdose death rates in 2015 were 
higher than metropolitan rates for those aged 26–34 years.
More age-adjusted drug overdose deaths occurred in a 
home versus in a medical facility or other location in each 
year for both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas 
(Table 3). The distribution changed over time, however, 
and the percentage of deaths that occurred in a home

increased from 1999 to 2015 in both metropolitan and 
nonmetropolitan areas (1999 metropolitan: 45.2% versus 2015 
metropolitan: 51.7%; 1999 nonmetropolitan: 43.3% versus 
2015 nonmetropolitan: 53.5%).
The increasing trends for males and females in age-adjusted 
drug overdose death rates varied by the six urban levels 
(Figure 2). Drug overdose death rates had a greater range by 
level of urban status for males in 1999 (noncore = 4.5 to large 
central metropolitan = 11.8) than in 2015 (noncore = 18.4 
to medium metropolitan = 23.0). Converse patterns were 
observed for females (1999 range: noncore = 2.9 large central 
metropolitan = 4.9; 2015 range: large central metropolitan = 9.9 to 
micropolitan nonmetropolitan = 14.6). At the beginning of the 
study period, death rates were higher in metropolitan areas than 
in nonmetropolitan areas, but the rates converged over time.
Discussion
This report presents an overview of illicit drug use, illicit drug 
use disorders, and drug overdose deaths for metropolitan and 
nonmetropolitan areas in the United States. The findings of this 
study indicate that trends varied. On the one hand, the decline 
in illicit drug use by youth and the lower prevalence of illicit 
drug use disorders are encouraging signs. On the other hand,

the increasing rate of drug overdose deaths in rural areas, which 
surpassed rates in urban areas, is cause for concern. Regardless 
of metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area, illicit drug use among 
youth generally declined over a 10-year period, but increased 
substantially in other age groups (aged 26–34 and ≥35 years). 
Declines in prescription opioid use disorders have also been 
demonstrated among persons aged 12–17 years (15). The 
percentage change increase between 1999 and 2015 in overdose 
deaths among nonmetropolitan residents is concerning and 
carries across sex, race, and intent. The type of drug involved in 
overdose deaths varies by metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area 
with rates of heroin and cocaine related overdose deaths being 
higher in more urban areas (7); however, monitoring trends 
in use and drugs involved in overdoses is critical as they have 
changed rapidly in recent years (16). Although past-month use 
of illicit drugs was lower in nonmetropolitan areas compared to 
metropolitan areas, the prevalence of drug use disorders among 
people reporting past-year illicit drug use in nonmetropolitan 
areas was similar to that in metropolitan areas. Studies have 
found that persons with substance use disorders are at higher 
risk for drug use-related morbidity and mortality (17). Further, 
given research indicating that nonmetropolitan areas have less 
access to substance abuse treatment services (18) and other risk 
reduction strategies (19), the similar prevalence of drug use 
disorders in this study underscores the importance of scaling 
up these critical interventions in nonmetropolitan areas.
Because of the involvement of prescription opioids in the 
current epidemic (20), monitoring prescribing levels along 
with understanding the local illicit drug trade is important for 
prevention efforts. Recent studies suggest that a leveling off and 
decline has occurred in opioid prescribing rates since 2012 and 
in high-dose prescribing rates since 2009 (7). However, overall 
opioid prescribing remained high in 2015 and the amounts 
prescribed varied by level of urbanization (21). Reducing the 
number of persons initially exposed to prescription opioids 
might reduce the illicit use of opioids, the subsequent risk of 
addiction, and the use of illicit drugs (22).
Interventions for drug overdoses, such as naloxone 
administration, rescue breathing, or calling 911, are most 
useful when someone is present to administer them. In both 
metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, the majority of 
overdose deaths occurred in a home, and rescue care could fall to 
friends or relatives who might lack knowledge about naloxone 
administration and follow-up care. In private locations, such 
as homes, bystanders might not know to call for emergency 
services after giving naloxone (23). Further, naloxone is less 
often administered by emergency medical technicians-basics 
(persons trained to provide basic-level life support), who are 
more common in rural areas (24) than paramedics (who can 
provide advanced life support care). Legislation designed to 
improve access to naloxone by laypersons is now present in all 
50 states and the District of Columbia (25).
Although prevalence rates of drug use in rural areas are 
lower in this report, the consequences of use appear to be 
higher. For example, an investigation of HIV infections 
linked to the injection of prescription opioids found that the 
majority of the counties at high risk for rapid dissemination 
of hepatitis C virus or HIV were in rural areas (26). Access 
to substance abuse treatment services is more limited in rural 
areas (27) and strengthening the health care delivery system 
while improving the integration of primary, specialty, and 
substance abuse services can provide the nexus of care needed to 
reduce drug misuse (28–31). Specific interventions to address 
overdose deaths in rural areas have been discussed previously 
(25) and might include actions such as expanding the types
of emergency medical service providers that can administer
naloxone to reverse a drug overdose. In addition, the following
resources can assist providers and communities in efforts to
reduce misuse and overdose:
• CDC’s rural health website (https://www.cdc.gov/
ruralhealth/) and the Guideline for Prescribing Opioids
for Chronic Pain resource page (https://www.cdc.gov/
drugoverdose/prescribing/resources.html;
• the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service
Administration’s Opioid Overdose Toolkit (https://store.
samhsa.gov/shin/content//SMA14-4742/Overdose_
Toolkit.pdf) or the Bureau of Justice Assistance Law
Enforcement Naloxone Toolkit website (https://www.
bjatraining.org/tools/naloxone/Naloxone-Background);
• the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
resource of tools and information for families, health care
providers, law enforcement, and other stakeholders about
prescription drug abuse and heroin use prevention,
treatment, and response (https://www.hhs.gov/opioids); and
• the Rural Health Information Hub’s toolkit, which
provides evidence-based examples, promising models,
program best practices, and resources that can be used to
implement substance abuse prevention and treatment
programs (https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/community-
health/substance-abuse).
Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least six 
limitations. First, NSDUH is a self-reported survey and is 
subject to recall bias and social desirability; however, good 
validity and reliability have been found for substance use 
measured by NSDUH (32). Second, NSDUH excluded persons 
who were homeless and not living in shelters or persons residing

 * Rates per 100,000 persons are adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population by the direct method. The NCHS six classification levels for counties are 1) large central metropolitan: part 
of a metropolitan statistical area with ≥1 million population and covers a principal city; 2) large fringe metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical area with ≥1 million population but 
does not cover a principal city; 3) medium metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical area with ≥250,000 but <1 million population; 4) small metropolitan: part of a metropolitan 
statistical area with <250,000 population; 5) micropolitan (nonmetropolitan): part of a micropolitan statistical area (has an urban cluster of ≥10,000 but <50,000 population); and 6) noncore 
(nonmetropolitan): not part of a metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area. For a dichotomous measure, metropolitan combines categories 1–4 and nonmetropolitan combines 5 and 6.
 † Race not determined in 3,041 deaths.
 § Hispanic origin can be of any race; other race categories exclude Hispanic origin.
 ¶ Subnational data representing <10 (0–9) persons are suppressed.
 ** Age not determined in 133 deaths.

in institutions, which could lead to underestimates in drug 
use and drug use disorders. Some areas might change in their 
urbanization categorization over time; however, few would 
have changed from the larger grouping of metropolitan to 
nonmetropolitan (14). In addition, the 2013 NCHS county-
based classification scheme was used for the entire time period 
for parsimony. Although metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas 
were not directly comparable between the two data systems, 
results demonstrate that it is important to consider the rural 
to urban continuum of population density for drug use and 
overdose. Third, overdose deaths are likely underestimated 
because lengthy investigations are often required including 
toxicology assessments and this sometimes results in a death 
being categorized as “pending manner and cause of death” at 
the time mortality files are closed and shared with NCHS. 
It was not possible to analyze this underestimation by urban 
level directly. Fourth, because of the misclassification of race/
ethnicity of decedents on death certificates, the actual numbers 
of deaths for certain racial/ethnic populations (e.g., American 
Indians/Alaska Natives and Hispanics) might be underestimated 
by up to 35% (33). Fifth, because information on intent might 
be coded in the mortality file even though the case could still be 
under investigation, it might be difficult to determine whether 
a death should be certified as suicide or unintentional (34). 
Finally, the time periods were different between the two data 
systems (NVSS-M: 1999–2015; NSDUH: 2003–2014), so the 
duration of change over time varied.
Conclusion
Drug use and subsequent overdoses continue to be a critical 
and complicated public health challenge. Variations and 
trends in drug overdose death rates by urban status differed 
by sex and race/ethnicity and trends among these subgroups 
indicate that certain groups are more profoundly affected by 
the epidemic than others. The decline in illicit drug use by 
youth and the lower prevalence of illicit drug use disorders in 
rural areas during 2012–2014 are encouraging signs. However, 
the rising death rate of drug overdoses in rural areas, which 
surpassed rates in urban areas, along with persistent limited 
access to substance abuse treatment services in rural areas is 
cause for concern. Educating opioid prescribers on the CDC 
Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain (35) and 
better access to evidence-based substance abuse treatment, 
including medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction, 
are critical steps that can be taken in communities heavily 
impacted by substance abuse.
