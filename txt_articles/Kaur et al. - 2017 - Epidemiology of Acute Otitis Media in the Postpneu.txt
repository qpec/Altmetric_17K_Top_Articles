Epidemiology of Acute Otitis 
Media in the Postpneumococcal 
Conjugate Vaccine Era
Ravinder Kaur, PhD, Matthew Morris, PhD, Michael E. Pichichero, MD
OBJECTIVES: To study the epidemiology of acute otitis media (AOM), especially the otitis-prone 
condition, during the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines 7 and 13 era.
METHODS: Six hundred and fifteen children were prospectively managed from 6 to 36 months 
of life during a 10-year time frame (June 2006–June 2016). All clinical diagnoses of AOM 
were confirmed by tympanocentesis and bacterial culture of middle ear fluid.
RESULTS: By 1 year of age, 23% of the children experienced ≥1 episode of AOM; by 3 years of 
age, 60% had ≥1 episodes of AOM, and 24% had ≥3 episodes. The peak incidence occurred 
at 6 to 12 months of life. Multivariable analysis of demographic and environmental data 
revealed a significantly increased risk of AOM associated with male sex, non-Hispanic white 
race, family history of recurrent AOM, day care attendance, and early occurrence of AOM. 
Risk factors for stringently defined (tympanocentesis-confirmed) otitis proneness, in which 
children suffered at least 3 episodes of AOM in a 6-month period or at least 4 within a year, 
were male sex, day care attendance, and family history of AOM, whereas breastfeeding 
in the first 6 months of life was protective. Stringently defined otitis prone children were 
also likely to experience their first AOM episode at a younger age. The proportion of 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis causing AOM 
had dynamic changes during the past decade.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the epidemiology but not the risk factors for AOM have 
undergone substantial changes since the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.

WhAt’S KNOWN ON thIS SUbjECt: Studies of 
epidemiology of acute otitis media (AOM) that 
relied on clinical diagnosis and occurred during 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccination are few, and 
none used the American Academy of Pediatrics’ 
current, strict definition of AOM, or included 
microbiologic confirmation by tympanocentesis.
WhAt thIS StUDy ADDS: During the pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine era, AOM incidence and frequency 
of the otitis-prone condition have decreased. 
Otopathogen predominance has undergone dynamic 
changes. Day care attendance and family history of 
AOM remain the major risk factors for AOM and for 
becoming otitis prone.

 In the 1980s, a prospective cohort 
study was conducted in Boston, 
Massachusetts, on the epidemiology 
of acute otitis media (AOM) in 698 
children who were observed for at 
least the first 3 years of life.1 In that 
time frame, the presence of fluid 
behind the tympanic membrane 
(TM) was considered evidence of 
AOM, amoxicillin was the dominant 
antibiotic prescribed and few 
alternative antibiotics were available. 
Reexamination of children after 
AOM was routinely performed, and 
persistence of fluid behind the TM 
was considered evidence of antibiotic 
treatment failure and additional 
antibiotics were prescribed.2 No 
vaccine to prevent AOM caused by 
any of the predominant bacterial 
otopathogens was available. In the 
3 decades since publication of that 
seminal work, major changes in the 
definition of AOM, demographics, 
modifying risk factors for AOM 
infection, antibiotic treatments, 
follow-up routines, and vaccinations 
have occurred. According to the 
American Academy for Pediatrics, 
over 5 000 000 AOM cases occur 
annually in US children, resulting 
in >10 000 000 annual antibiotic 
prescriptions and ∼30 000 000 
annual visits for medical care.3 
– 
6 It is 
the most common condition treated 
with antibiotics, and increasing 
incidence of antibiotic resistance 
among the organisms responsible for 
AOM is a cause for concern.
Our group commenced a prospective, 
longitudinal study of a cohort of 
children in their first 3 years of life 
in Rochester, New York, to reassess 
the epidemiology, etiology, and 
immunobiology of AOM during the 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV) era.7 
–16 Central to our study 
design has been the microbiologic 
confirmation of nearly every clinical 
diagnosis of AOM by culture of 
middle ear fluid (MEF) collected by 
tympanocentesis (a technique rarely 
used worldwide).6, 
 
17
Streptococcus pneumoniae, 
Haemophilus influenzae, and 
Moraxella catarrhalis are the 3 main 
otopathogens causing AOM, 
6, 
 
17  
but the implementation of national 
childhood immunization programs 
against S pneumoniae has led 
to changes in the proportion 
of infections caused by these 
organisms.10, 
 
14– 
16
Here, we describe the epidemiology 
of AOM on the basis of our study in 
the most recent 10 years (2006–
2016). Key differences that have 
occurred since the 1980s study 
include a much stricter definition 
of AOM and of antibiotic treatment 
failure, emergence of antibiotic 
resistance among all 3 of the 
dominant bacterial otopathogens, 
and the consequence of PCV 
introduction. The influence of PCVs 
on incidence, demographics of 
those experiencing AOM infection, 
risk factors for AOM, and etiology 
were determined in our large 
prospectively managed cohort. 
Similarly, characterization of factors 
contributing to otitis proneness, in 
which children suffer from recurrent 
otitis media with ≥3 episodes 
within 6 months or ≥4 in a year was 
accomplished.
MEthODS
Patient Population
Children included in this study were 
in their first 3 years of life, recruited 
as part of a prospective cohort as 
previously described.13 Healthy term 
infants were recruited at 6 months of 
age and managed with collection of 
nasopharyngeal and blood samples 
at regular intervals from 6 to 36 
months (6-, 9-, 12-, 15-, 18-, 24-, and 
36-months visits) and at every AOM 
episode. The study was approved by 
the University of Rochester and the 
Rochester General Hospital Research 
Subjects Review Boards.
Definitions
1. (A) AOM: The diagnosis of 
AOM was made by 2 validated 
otoscopists. AOM was diagnosed 
with acute onset of possible 
otalgia and had TMs that were: (a) 
mild, moderate, or severe bulging, 
(b) completely opacified or a 
cloudy or purulent effusion was 
observed, and (c) TM mobility was 
reduced and/or absent, consistent 
with the American Academy of 
Pediatrics 2013 guidelines.5 (B) 
Stringently defined otitis prone 
(sOP): A child was considered sOP 
if he or she experienced at least 
3 AOM episodes within 6 months 
or at least 4 AOM episodes in a 
year. (C) Nonotitis prone (NOP): 
A child who had no AOM episodes 
or low frequency of AOM episodes. 
(D) Antibiotic treatment failure: 
If a child returned for medical 
care with symptoms and signs of 
AOM within 2 weeks of receiving 
antibiotic therapy for a previous 
AOM episode, that episode was 
considered AOM treatment-failure 
and a second tympanocentesis 
was performed.
2. Treatment: After diagnosis 
of AOM, each child received a 
high-dose of amoxicillin and/or 
clavulanate for 5 days regardless 
of the child’s age.18 On the basis of 
tympanocentesis culture results 
that identify the frequency of 
amoxicillin-resistant otopathogens 
in our study population (50% 
of H influenzae and 100% of 
M catarrhalis are β-lactamase 
producing), the patients are 
predominantly treated with 
amoxicillin-clavulanate. A shorter 
course of 5-day treatment is based 
on our own research18 and a 
Cochrane Database of Systematic 
Reviews protocol showing a 
marginal benefit of 10-day over 
5-day antibiotic treatment.19 
Children allergic to amoxicillin or 
who previously could not tolerate 
amoxicillin and/or clavulanate 
received cefdinir (∼15% of cases).

 3. Risk factors for AOM: A 
questionnaire was administered 
to parents detailing sex, race and 
ethnicity, day care attendance, and 
whether the child was exposed 
to secondhand smoke at home 
(parental smoking).
4. Family history of recurrent AOM: 
A sibling and parental history of 
recurrent AOM was considered 
to have >3 episodes of AOM or 
ear tube insertion surgery for 
persistent or recurrent MEF in a 
sibling or either parent, occurring 
before the child was enrolled in 
study.
5. Breastfeeding: We defined the 
duration of breastfeeding by 
asking parents how often the child 
was being breastfed at 6 months 
of age by providing parents with 
the following percentages: 0%, 
50%, or 100% of the time.
6. Atopy: A child with atopy 
presented with allergic 
hypersensitivity reactions to one 
or more of the following: eczema, 
allergic rhinitis, or allergic asthma.
7. Vaccine status: All the study 
children received 4 doses of 
either 7-valent-PCV (enrolled 
before April 2010) or 13-valent-
PCV (enrolled after April 2010) 
at 2, 4, and 6 months of age 
with a booster at 15 months, 
along with the regular pediatric 
immunization schedule of 
vaccines.
Sample Collection and Microbiology
Details of sample collection, 
processing, and analysis have 
been described previously.13, 
 
20, 
 
21 
Tympanocentesis was performed and 
50 to 250 µL of MEF were obtained. 
Bacteria were isolated from MEF 
according to standard laboratory 
culture procedures. Antibiotic-
susceptibility testing was performed 
as previously described.14, 
16
Data Analysis
Odds ratios for risk factors were 
calculated by using multiple logistic 
regressions with AOM or otitis 
proneness as an outcome. Starting 
models contained all variables with 
2-way interactions, and a stepwise 
model selection was performed 
in both forward and backward 
directions by using the Bayesian 
information criterion in base R 
version-3.1.1. For otopathogens 
distribution in the MEF during AOM 
in both sOP and NOP populations,  
a difference in proportions test  
(χ2 or Fisher’s exact test) was used. 
A P value of <.05 was considered 
significant.
RESULtS
Demographics and Incidence of AOM
Data were analyzed for 615 children 
who were managed for at least 2 
years after enrollment at 6 months of 
age. Table 1 shows the demographic 
characteristics of these children. 
The cumulative experience of AOM 
to age 1, 2, and 3 to 4 years for 615 
children is shown in Table 2. The 
mean number of AOM episodes 
decreased from 0.38 per child during 
year 1 to 0.15 per child in year 3. The 
incidence of AOM in each of the 3 
years is shown in Table 3. By age 1, 
23.0% of children had ≥1 episode of 
AOM and 3.6% had ≥3 episodes. The 
peak incidence of AOM occurred ∼12 
months of age. Figure 1 shows age 
of first episode of AOM for children 
managed from birth to age 3 years. In 
our population, 26 children had AOM 
treatment failure (∼5%) in which 
the child was diagnosed again with 
AOM within 15 days of first antibiotic 
treatment.
Variables Associated With Increased 
Risk of AOM
Univariate analyses of factors are 
shown in Table 4, which revealed 
a number of variables significantly 
associated with increased risk for 
experiencing AOM in the first, second, 
or third year of life. For ≥1 episode of 
AOM in the first year of life, variables 
included male sex, family history of 
ear infection, non-Hispanic white 
race, and attending day care. A

 negative association with exposure 
to smoke was attributable to 
interactions with race. In the second 
and third year of the children’s life, 
only day care attendance and family 
history of AOM, respectively, were 
significantly associated with risk of 
having AOM.
Although atopy and breastfeeding 
were not significantly associated 
with AOM risk within a particular age 
group, atopy significantly increased 
the risk of experiencing at least 1 
AOM episode by 3 years of age (P = 
.011) and breastfeeding significantly 
decreased this risk (P = .024)  
(Table 4).
Because many of these variables 
were closely correlated, we used 
a logistic regression to explore 
the contribution of each variable 
to the risk of AOM. Multivariable 
analysis (Table 5) showed day care 
attendance, non-Hispanic white 
race, and atopy as associated with 
risk of having AOM; in addition, 
children who had siblings in addition 
to a family history of AOM had an 
increased risk of experiencing AOM. 
The decreased risk associated with 
exposure to smoke was eliminated 
from the multivariable model 
because of interactions with race.
Age at First Diagnosis of AOM
To determine the association 
between the risk for later AOM 
and age at time of first diagnosis 
of AOM, we included 231 children 
who experienced their first episode 
of AOM before 3 years of age. 
 
Table 6 shows the percentages of 
children experiencing additional 
AOM episodes after first diagnosis 
at different age intervals. Children 
experiencing a first AOM episode 
before 12 months of age had a ∼70% 
chance of experiencing at least 
one more AOM episode. Logistic 
regression indicated that the age at 
which a child first experienced AOM 
was significantly associated with 
additional AOM episodes (P < .0001), 
with younger first AOM episode ages 
predisposing children more strongly 
toward future AOM episodes.
Variables Associated With Increased 
Risk of Recurrent Otitis Media
Univariate analysis identified male 
sex, family history of AOM, and day 
care attendance as significantly 
associated with the sOP condition 
(Table 7). Because many of 
these variables were correlated, 
multivariable logistic regression 
was performed, identifying male 
sex, family history of AOM, and day 
care attendance to be risk factors 
for sOP, whereas breastfeeding was 
protective (Table 8).
Otopathogens in sOP and NOP 
Children
The proportion of MEF isolates 
yielding S pneumoniae, H influenzae 
and M catarrhalis have changed 
over time since the introduction 
of PCVs. Deployment of different 
PCV formulas has been followed by 
changes in the relative prevalence 
of S pneumoniae, H influenzae, 
 and 
M catarrhalis (Fig 2A). In particular, 
dividing the study period into 3 eras 
(pre-PCV: 1995–2001, PCV7: 2001–
2010, PCV13: 2010–2016) shows a 
significant decrease in S pneumoniae 
prevalence and a simultaneous 
increase in M catarrhalis prevalence 
as causative pathogens of AOM, 
particularly since the introduction 
of PCV13 (Fig 2B). H influenzae 
has remained a predominant 
otopathogen, and our latest data for 
2016 reveals a surge in H influenzae 
prevalence (Fig 2A). From 2006 to 
2016, MEF samples tested culture 
positive for no otopathogen in 
27.6% ± 3.6% of cases. During the 
time frame of 2006–2016, similar 
otopathogen proportions in sOP 
and NOP children were observed 
except for H influenzae, 
 which was 
significantly more prevalent in sOP 
(35.2%) than NOP (25.8%, P = .02) 
(Fig 3). Multiple otopathogens were 
only rarely isolated from the MEF in

of MEF S pneumoniae isolates that 
were intermediately susceptible to 
penicillin was 24%, whereas those 
resistant to penicillin was 16%; total 
penicillin nonsusceptible 40%. The 
proportion of β-lactamase producing 
H influenzae isolated from MEF

to amoxicillin) was 45%, and the 
proportion of β-lactamase producing 
M catarrhalis was 100%.
DISCUSSION
AOM is a complex disease with 
many different factors contributing 
to its epidemiology. By applying 
strict inclusion and diagnostic 
criteria, confirming every AOM by 
tympanocentesis and microbiological 
culture over a 10-year period, 
we performed an unprecedented 
study to investigate the risk factors 
associated with AOM infections. 
We sought to update the seminal 
work of Teele et al1 published in 
1989 after completion of their 
prospective cohort study in 
Boston, Massachusetts, regarding 
epidemiology of otitis media during 
the first years of life in children.
Incidence
In our study, by 1 year of age, 23% of 
children experienced ≥1 episode of 
AOM and 3.6% have had ≥3 episodes 
of AOM. By 3 years of age ∼60% of 
children have had ≥1 episode of AOM 
and ∼24% have had ≥3 episodes of 
AOM, with ∼11% meeting the sOP 
definition. In the 1989 report from 
the Boston pediatric cohort, by 3 
years of age >80% of children had 
experienced ≥1 AOM and >40% had 
≥3 episodes; a significant decrease 
of AOM cases appears to have 
occurred by comparing the results 
from the current situation. The most 
prominent likely explanation is the 
change in definition of AOM and 
confirmation of all diagnoses in our 
cohort in Rochester, New York, by 
tympanocentesis. However, we note 
that Chonmaitree et al22 in Galveston, 
Texas, applied a similar diagnostic 
criteria as we did and found that 46% 
of children had ≥1 episode of AOM by 1 
year of age; a higher incidence than the 
23% incidence we observed, probably 
due to populations demographics 
differences in our children compared

 with the Galveston, Texas, cohort. The 
observed rate of culture negative MEF 
results in which no otopathogens was 
detected during AOM in our population 
was ∼27% from 2003 to 2016 (PCV 
era). Researchers conducting studies 
during the pre-PCV era (1980–2000) 
have reported highly variable culture 
negative rates (7%, 
23 22%, 
24 24%25, 
and 42%26) in MEF samples of AOM. 
Our observations fall within this range, 
but we find no evidence of a trend 
toward increasing culture negative 
rates in MEF since the introduction 
of PCVs. By using a polymerase 
chain detection in a subset of culture 
negative samples we detected the 
presence of S pneumoniae, H influenza, 
 
or M catarrhalis in 17% of culture 
negative samples to the total detection 
of otopathogens in >88% of MEF 
samples during AOM.27 An overall 
decline in the incidence of otitis media 
(including AOM, otitis media with 
effusion, and chronic suppurative 
otitis media) over the past decade has 
been reported in a recent review.28 
However, the studies included in that 
review include many studies that 
may have significant methodological 
flaws.29 The stringent AOM diagnostic 
criteria employed in our study 
eliminates mis- or overdiagnosis 
of AOM, which has been noted as a 
significant challenge.30, 
31 The mean 
number of episodes in our cohort was 
only 0.4 with a range of 0 to 5 episodes 
compared with 1.2 with a range of 0 to 
6 episodes by Teele et al, 
1 a threefold 
reduction. The peak incidence of AOM 
occurred during 6 to 12 months of 
age in our study is consistent with 
Teele et al1, 
 
32, 
 
33 and various previous 
prospective studies.22,

 predictive for risk of AOM and 
recurrent AOM.
Sex
We found male sex to be a significant 
risk factor for developing AOM in the 
first year of life but not in the second 
or third year of life. Multivariable 
analysis did not identify male sex 
as a risk factor for AOM when the 
cumulative risk was estimated over 
the first 3 years of life. Male sex was 
a significant risk factor of being sOP 
both in univariate and multivariable 
analyses consistent with Teele 
et al1, 
 
33 and most epidemiologic 
studies.38 
–40 Boys have frequently 
been observed to show heightened 
susceptibility to infectious diseases; 
this has been attributed to 
interactions between sex hormones 
and T helper 1 and 2 cytokine 
balances.41
Family History
The strongest risk factor of AOM and 
sOP condition was a family history of 
AOM, which was consistent with the 
findings of Teele et al.1 Evaluation 
of the genetic contribution to the 
development of otitis media remains 
challenging. Researchers have 
evaluated the potential association 
between single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms of selected genes in 
determining susceptibility to acute or 
recurrent AOM.42 
– 
47 Esposito et al42  
showed an association between 
variants in genes’ encoding factors 
of innate or adaptive immunity and 
recurrent AOM. Recently, genome-
wide association studies of AOM 
were performed and identified the 
6q25.3 locus associated with AOM, 
46 
and chromosome 17q12 and 10q22.3 
regions associated with recurrent 
AOM.47

 Race
Our multivariable analysis identified 
a significant increase in AOM risk 
associated with non-Hispanic 
white race. Teele et al1 included 
only non-Hispanic white subjects 
in their study, so no comparison is 
possible. African American and Asian 
American infants are less likely to 
be diagnosed with AOM probably 
because of care seeking behavior; 
race is confounded by multiple social 
factors.48 In our data set, 19.2% 
African American and Hispanic 
children attended day care compared 
with 32.2% of white children (P = 
.0825).
Day Care
Day care attendance was the 
strongest single predictor of both 
AOM and becoming sOP in our study 
cohort, probably due to increased 
environmental exposure of children 
to otopathogen nasal colonization 
and upper respiratory viral infections 
that facilitate AOM pathogenesis. 
Teele et al1 did not include day care 
as a risk factor, but other researchers 
have found day care as a major risk 
factor for AOM.40, 
 
44, 
 
49 
– 
52
Smoking
Previous studies have revealed  
either high or no risk of AOM with 
passive smoke exposure.35, 
 
52 
–55  
Teele et al1 did not find an 
association of smoking with AOM by 
using a multivariable analysis, but a 
univariate analysis showed parent 
smoking as a risk factor for AOM in 
the first year of life. Surprisingly, our 
univariate analysis found a significant 
decrease in AOM incidence among 
children <12 months old who were 
exposed to secondhand smoke, but 
this association was not significant 
after multivariable calculations. In 
our study, ∼13% of children were 
exposed to parental smoking overall. 
However, 28% of African American 
and Hispanic children and only 9% 
of non-Hispanic white children were 
exposed to household smoke (P < 
.0001). Because non-Hispanic white 
race is a significant risk factor of 
AOM in our study, the identification 
of secondhand smoke exposure as 
protective against AOM was found 
to be attributable to the significantly 
reduced incidence of smoking in the 
populations at greatest risk for AOM.
Atopy
We found atopy to be a significant 
risk factor for AOM but no association 
with sOP condition. Although Teele 
et al1 did not explore atopy as an 
AOM risk factor, researchers for 
other studies have revealed an 
association of atopy and recurrent 
AOM and chronic otitis media with 
effusion.37, 
 
56 Lack et al57 showed that 
obstruction of Eustachian tube can 
occur because of allergies.
Breastfeeding
Children who were breastfed 50% of 
the time up to 6 months of age were 
significantly less likely to experience 
at least 1 AOM episode, and 
breastfeeding was associated with 
an overall decreased risk of AOM. 
Teele et al1 also found that breastfed 
infants had lower risk of AOM as well 
as recurrent AOM, which is consistent 
with many other studies.35, 
 
40, 
 
44, 
58, 
 
59 
Sabirov et al60 have shown the likely 
mechanism by which breastfeeding 
decreases risk of AOM; breastfeeding 
stimulates the immune response 
of infants, measured as higher 
concentrations of antibodies against 
otopathogens.
Age at First AOM Episode and sOP 
Condition
We found that younger age for a first 
AOM episode was a major predictor 
of the likelihood to become otitis 
prone. Teele et al1 made a similar 
observation as did Macintyre et al.34, 
 
61
Otopathogens in sOP and NOP 
Children
Before PCVs, various studies 
reported S pneumoniae and H 
influenzae as the main otopathogens 
of otitis media, including recurrent 
AOM.26, 
 
62 
– 
67 We have been 
prospectively obtaining MEF by 
tympanocentesis since 1995 and 
have observed many dynamic 
changes in the proportions of 
S pneumoniae, H influenza, and 
M catarrhalis isolates. PCVs 
introduction has consistently been 
associated with a decline of AOM 
infections caused by S pneumoniae 
followed by an increase as strains 
expressing nonvaccine capsular 
types have emerged.14 
–16 We also 
have consistently observed an 
increase in antibiotic resistant 
strains for S pneumoniae, H 
influenza, and M catarrhalis, more so 
in children frequently treated with 
antibiotics because they are otitis 
prone.
Our study has strengths and 
weaknesses that were inherent to our 
study design. The strengths included 
a prospective, longitudinal study 
design along with a large sample 
size; strict definitions of AOM, otitis 
prone, and antibiotic treatment 
failure; consistency of diagnosis 
criteria applied by only 2 highly 
qualified, validated otoscopists; and 
consistency in antibiotic treatment 
regimen. Another strength that is also 
a weakness relates to the fact that all 
the children had tympanocentesis 
to confirm the diagnosis and 
determine the etiology of AOM. 
We have previously shown that 
tympanocentesis is a therapeutic 
procedure.30, 
 
68 Not only does the 
procedure reduce pain as soon as the 
pressure of the middle ear infection 
is relieved but also it reduces the 
incidence of subsequent AOM and 
the need to insert tympanostomy 
tubes.30 Our results are likely to be 
generalizable to other primary care 
pediatric practices serving a diverse 
population typically seen in a suburban 
practice setting. Child populations that 
greatly differ from the demographic 
description of our study cohort may 
not have similar results.

 CONCLUSIONS
The epidemiology of AOM has 
undergone shifts over the past 
30 years, especially since the 
introduction of PCVs. Because the 
risk factors for AOM we identify in 
this study are predominantly similar 
to those described by Teele et al, 
1 
we conclude that much of the shift 
in otopathogen prevalence can be 
attributed to the influence of the 
vaccine and changes in diagnostic 
criteria for AOM versus otitis media 
with effusion. In comparison with 
30 years ago, (1) the number of 
AOM episodes and the number of 
otitis-prone children have decreased, 
and major contributors to this 
decrease are the introduction of PCV 
formulations and more stringent 
diagnostic criteria; (2) AOM early 
in life remains a predictor of otitis-
prone condition; (3) day care 
attendance and family history of 
AOM are predominant risk factors in 
both AOM and becoming otitis prone; 
and (4) the otopathogens mix has 
undergone multiple dynamic changes 
that likely will continue in the years 
ahead.
