Aim To assess the relationship between time spent in 
light physical activity and cardiometabolic health and 
mortality in adults.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources Searches in Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, 
CINAHL and three rounds of hand searches.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Experimental 
(including acute mechanistic studies and physical activity 
intervention programme) and observational studies 
(excluding case and case–control studies) conducted 
in adults (aged ≥18 years) published in English before 
February 2018 and reporting on the relationship between 
light physical activity (<3 metabolic equivalents) and 
cardiometabolic health outcomes or all-cause mortality.
study appraisal and synthesis Study quality appraisal 
with QUALSYST tool and random effects inverse variance 
meta-analysis.
Results Seventy-two studies were eligible including 
27 experimental studies (and 45 observational studies). 
Mechanistic experimental studies showed that short but 
frequent bouts of light-intensity activity throughout the day 
reduced postprandial glucose (−17.5%; 95% CI −26.2 to 
−8.7) and insulin (−25.1%; 95% CI −31.8 to –18.3) levels 
compared with continuous sitting, but there was very limited 
evidence for it affecting other cardiometabolic markers. 
Three light physical activity programme intervention studies 
(n ranging from 12 to 58) reduced adiposity, improved 
blood pressure and lipidaemia; the programmes consisted 
of activity of >150 min/week for at least 12 weeks. Six out 
of eight prospective observational studies that were entered 
in the meta-analysis reported that more time spent in daily 
light activity reduced risk of all-cause mortality (pooled HR 
0.71; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.83).
Conclusions Light-intensity physical activity could play a 
role in improving adult cardiometabolic health and reducing 
mortality risk. Frequent short bouts of light activity improve 
glycaemic control. Nevertheless, the modest volume of the 
prospective epidemiological evidence base and the moderate 
consistency between observational and laboratory evidence 
inhibits definitive conclusions.
InTRoDuCTIon
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of 
premature mortality.1 Compelling evidence shows 
a clear dose–response between the total volume of 
physical activity and risk of cardiovascular diseases 
and mortality.2–4 However, the large majority of 
the evidence is for leisure-time moderate to vigor-
ous-intensity physical activity (MVPA, defined 
as ≥3 
metabolic equivalents (MET)) improving risk 
factors associated with cardiovascular diseases such 
as high blood pressure, overweight and obesity, 
hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and mortality. 
Consequently, health promotion programmes and 
public health guidelines emphasise the need for 
the public to engage in MVPA with relatively little 
consideration to activities of lower intensity.5 6
Light-intensity physical activity (LIPA), activity 
performed at under 3 METs, including casual 
walking, doing household shores or activities of daily 
living, has received much less research attention. 
However, in the last decade it has been recognised 
that physical activity represents a continuum.7 This 
raises the question of the health-enhancing poten-
tial of LIPA.8 9 LIPA promotion may be a feasible 
means to increase volume of activity because LIPA 
does not require dedicated time commitment or 
planning as it usually involves incidental daily living 
and increase in movement during occupational time 
(eg, ambulation, low-intensity walking).
However, there is a paucity of evidence on the 
effects of LIPA on cardiometabolic health among 
relatively healthy populations. To date, only one 
systematic review has attempted to summarise 
evidence on the relationship between LIPA and 
cardiometabolic risk factors of cardiovascular 
disease.9 Therefore, we aimed to synthesise evidence 
from observational and experimental studies and to 
quantify the effect of LIPA on acute and long-term 
cardiometabolic health through meta-analysis.
METhoDs
This systematic review is reported following the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses10 and Meta-analysis of Obser-
vational Studies in Epidemiology11 guidelines. This 
review was performed following an a priori written 
protocol documented in online supplementary 
material 1.
Literature search
Four electronic databases (Medline, Embase, 
PsycInfo and CINAHL) were used to identify rele-
vant studies according to the search strategy which

Review
was developed in collaboration with two librarians (see online 
supplementary material 2). The databases were searched from 
inception to February 2018. As there is no standardised termi-
nology to describe the exposure of interest (light incidental 
physical activity 1.5–3 METs), we expected difficulties to fully 
capture the literature comprehensively using a set of keywords. 
Consequently, a thorough secondary manual search strategy was 
conducted to ensure completeness of records (see online supple-
mentary material 1 for full search strategy). The reference lists 
of all selected articles were also screened for eligible records. In 
turn, the reference lists of any article identified this way were 
screened as well. This process was repeated until no new eligible 
articles were identified (three rounds).
Inclusion criteria
Articles reporting experimental or observational studies inves-
tigating the relationship between LIPA and cardiometabolic 
health markers or all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality 
in adults (aged ≥18 
years) and published in English were eligible 
for inclusion. To be included, studies had to measure (either 
subjectively or objectively) or elicit experimentally LIPA, defined 
as any physical activity above 1.5 METs and below 3 METs.
Exclusion criteria
As the focus of the review was on the primary prevention, 
we excluded studies which investigated cardiac rehabilitation 
programmes and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention 
trials and longitudinal studies. For the same reason, we also 
excluded studies which investigated only populations with diag-
nosed cardiovascular diseases or patients with cancer.
study selection
The title and abstract of retrieved articles were screened for 
eligibility by two independent reviewers randomly assigned to 
each article from a pool of five reviewers (SFMC, MDC, JVC, 
KDC, LP). At this stage, studies were excluded solely if the avail-
able information in the title or the abstract made it clear that 
the article did not meet the criteria. Full texts were retrieved 
for all remaining articles and were assessed for inclusion by 
two randomly assigned reviewers to each article from a pool 
of five reviewers (SFMC, MDC, JVC, KDC, LP) who read the 
articles independently. Reasons for exclusion were recorded by 
each reviewer. SFMC collated all information and in the case 
of disagreement, consensus was reached via discussion between 
SFMC and the reviewers.
study quality assessment
Included studies were rated independently by pairs of reviewers 
from a pool of six coauthors (LP
, JVC, MDC, PD, KDC) using 
the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary 
Research Papers from a Variety of Fields QUALSYST tool.12 This 
tool was selected as it allows appraising quality and assessing 
potential for bias over a wide variety of research designs from 
experimental to observational. SFMC collated all information 
and in the case of disagreement, consensus was reached via 
discussion.
Data extraction
Study characteristics and data describing the relationship 
between LIPA and cardiometabolic outcomes and mortality were 
extracted using different pro forma for experimental and obser-
vational studies. Each study was assigned randomly a pair of 
reviewers from a pool of five coauthors (SFMC, LP
, JVC, MDC, 
KDC) to extract the information.
Meta-analysis
We made an a priori decision to perform a meta-analysis only 
if at least four studies were eligible for a given outcome and the 
research design would allow effect sizes to be harmonised. If 
two articles reported results drawn from the same experimental 
study or observational data set we only included the study with 
the highest quality score in the meta-analysis. In order to ascer-
tain if there was a differential benefit of LIPA for people who 
have some form of metabolic impairment (eg, obesity or type 2 
diabetes) we conducted subgroup analysis by metabolic health 
status of participants (studies that excluded participants with 
metabolic impairment; studies that specifically recruited partici-
pants free of such impairments). Meta-analyses were performed 
with Review Manager V
.5.313 using the inverse-variance 
methods with a random effect because of the small number of 
studies available and their methodological diversity. Heteroge-
neity was measured using Cochran’s X2 test and Higgins’s I2 test. 
Publication bias was explored using funnel plots. We conducted 
sensitivity analysis by removing the lowest quality studies from 
the analysis.
REsuLTs
study selection and characteristics
The systematic search in the databases and the hand search 
yielded 6683 articles. Of these, we screened 321 full texts and 
finally included 72 in the review (figure 1). The majority of 
articles were excluded due to the way LIPA was defined, for 
example, LIPA often being defined as a low volume of activity 
regardless of intensity. The characteristics of the included studies 
are detailed in online supplementary tables S1–S4. Publica-
tion dates ranged from 1990 to 2018, with 50% of included 
studies published in the last 4 
years. In the included articles, 27 
reported on experimental studies, including 20 acute mecha-
nistic studies and seven physical activity programme interven-
tion studies. The remaining 45 articles reported on observational 
studies, including 28 cross-sectional and 17 prospective analyses. 
Cardiometabolic and other health outcomes considered in the 
studies included adiposity markers (body mass index, waist 
circumference), glycaemia (plasma glucose, HbA1c, homeo-
stasis model assessment for insulin, plasma insulin, C-peptides), 
lipidaemia (plasma triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), blood pressure, inflam-
matory markers (eg, C-reactive protein), fitness, incidence of 
chronic diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers) and 
all-cause mortality. The majority of mechanistic acute studies 
concentrated on glycaemia and lipidaemia while physical 
activity intervention programme studies most often examined 
blood pressure. Cross-sectional studies primarily investigated 
glycaemia, lipidaemia and adiposity, while prospective studies 
commonly focused on mortality.
study quality
Quality scores for each study are given in online supplementary 
tables S1–S4. Overall quality scores were normally distributed 
with a mean of 65% in each type of study. The majority of 
controlled studies used quasiexperimental or crossover designs 
rather than randomised controlled trials. Among the acute 
mechanistic studies, articles reporting experiments conducted 
in free-living conditions scored lower than those conducted in 
controlled laboratory settings. For physical activity programme

Review
Figure 1 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagram. LIPA, light-intensity physical activity. 
intervention studies, small sample sizes and lack of an appro-
priate control group were the most common reasons for lower 
quality scores. The range of scores was wider for observational 
studies mostly due to small sample sizes and inadequately justi-
fied analytic approaches.
Acute mechanistic studies
T
wenty crossover studies investigated the acute effect through the 
course of a day of exposure to bouts of LIPA. Four studies inves-
tigated the effect of a single continuous bout of LIPA,14–17 while 
12 studies examined the effect of a set sequence of short bouts in 
laboratory settings,18–29 and 4 studies examined the effect of the 
natural sequence of bouts of LIPA in free living conditions.30–33 
Among all mechanistic studies, 13 investigated the effect on 
glycaemia,17 20 22–26 28 30 32–34 6 on triglycerides,19 20 24 32 33 35 5 
on cholesterol,17 23 30 32 33 5 on blood pressure21 23 29 33 36 and 
1 specifically on inflammatory markers.15 Sample sizes ranged 
from 1026 to 3428 participants, either healthy or drawn from 
convenience samples of metabolically impaired populations.
Meta-analysis was possible for studies investigating the effect 
of frequent short bouts of LIPA on plasma glucose, insulin 
and triglycerides (figure 2). Overall, acute mechanistic studies 
resulted in a statistically significant reduction in postprandial 
glucose (−17.48%; 95% CI −31.74 to –8.42) induced by bouts 
of LIPA as short as 2 
min and interrupting sedentary behaviour 
at least every 20 
min (figure 2A). Subgroup analysis showed that 
the effects on glucose outcomes were only significant both in 
metabolically impaired individuals. However, heterogeneity was 
significant (p<0.001) and high (I2=95%). This heterogeneity 
was driven by the inclusion of studies conducted both in the 
laboratory and in free-living conditions.30 32 33 If these studies 
were excluded, the four studies on metabolically impaired 
participants were homogeneous (I2=0%) and statistically insig-
nificant (p=0.54). Sensitivity analysis showed that when the 
lowest quality study conducted in free-living conditions was 
removed from the analysis, results for healthy individual became 
significant (p=0.0005). There was no statistical difference in 
effect between groups but the effect appears larger in metabol-
ically impaired individuals. Among laboratory studies, short 
bouts of LIPA reduced postprandial glucose by 20.07% (95% CI 
−37.18 to –2.96) for normal individual and by −28.72% 
(95% CI −33.92 to –23.52) in impaired individuals.
For insulin (figure 2B), experimental studies displayed a 
statistically significant difference in postprandial insulin level 
(−25.05; 95% CI −31.76 to −18.33) with no difference in 
effect between groups. These results persisted in subsequent 
sensitivity analyses where lower quality or free-living studies 
were removed from the analysis. In addition, two studies16 37

persisted until the following day. Heterogeneity was high and 
significant (p<0.001; I²=89%) and was not modified by the 
sensitivity analysis.
For triglycerides (figure 2C), there was no significant effect 
(−0.31%; 
95% CI −5.62 to 5.01). Subgroup analysis showed 
no difference between healthy and metabolically impaired 
individuals. Heterogeneity was high and statistically significant

the results but did reduce the heterogeneity, I²=27%.

sure reported significant positive effects of LIPA19 21 31 while

effects of LIPA on inflammatory markers.15

Review

cause mortality expressed as HR between highest and lowest amount of time reported in the studies. This corresponds to about a doubling of the time 
spent in light activity daily.
Physical activity programme intervention studies
Seven studies investigated the effect of participating in a long-
term physical activity programme of LIPA on fitness (n=1), 
lipidaemia (n=4), adiposity (n=4), glycaemia (n=5) and blood 
pressure (n=4). There were not enough studies with outcomes 
data that could be pooled to conduct a meta-analysis and only a 
narrative synthesis was possible. LIPA was delivered in the form 
of walking programmes, cycling or yoga for 12–16 weeks at a 
volume ranging from 90 to 300 
min/week. Three studies were 
quasiexperimental39–41 with small sample sizes ranging from 8 to 
15 participants, and four were randomised controlled trials42–44 
with larger sample sizes ranging from 25 to 171 participants. 
Quasiexperimental studies reported significant improvements 
in fitness (increase of 5.5% in VO2max
39), blood pressure (reduc-
tion of around 10% in systolic and diastolic blood pressure),41 
glycaemia (33% increase in glucose effectiveness39 40), adiposity 
(reduction of 6.1% in body fat41) and lipidaemia (reduction of 
6% in total cholesterol41) as a result of engaging in LIPA struc-
tured programmes. However, these results were not systemati-
cally replicated in larger scale randomised trials. Only Paoli et 
al42 reported a significant improvement in adiposity (reduction 
of 9.7% in fat mass), blood pressure (decrease of 8% in systolic 
blood pressure and 2.5 in diastolic blood pressure) and lipi-
daemia (decrease of 2.5% in total cholesterol) after 12 weeks 
of 150 
min/week of LIPA delivered as a light-intensity circuit 
training programme. The other three studies43–45 showed no 
effect, but the volume of LIPA delivered was considerably lower 
at 90 
min/week of LIPA.
Cross-sectional observational studies
T
wenty-eight articles included in this review reported results 
of cross-sectional analyses, including nine articles of the 2003–
2006 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) and another 19 other epidemiological 
studies (online supplementary table S3). There was substantial 
heterogeneity in outcome measures and analytic procedures to 
enable meta-analysis. Among those, 17 studies reported associ-
ations with adiposity markers, 14 with lipidaemia markers, 19 
with glycaemia markers, 3 with cardiophysical fitness, 7 with 
inflammatory markers, 9 with blood pressure and 5 with meta-
bolic syndrome. Sample sizes ranged from n=50 
to 11 
000. 
Most articles (n=17) were based on objectively measured LIPA. 
There were consistent reports across studies of an association 
between time spent in LIPA and adiposity markers, lipidaemia 
markers (particularly triglyceride levels) and inflammatory 
markers. Generally, the reported effect sizes were small and 
were consistently stronger with the increased absolute inten-
sity of LIPA considered. Evidence concerning associations with 
glycaemia was equivocal. Five separate analyses of NHANES 
data systematically reported beneficial associations between 
time spent in LIPA and glucose or insulin levels. This strongly 
suggests that in this study this cross-sectional association is 
indeed present, but this was not replicated in all other studies 
which mostly reported non-significant for association between 
time spent in LIPA and glycaemia. Equivocal findings were also 
found for outcomes such as fitness, the metabolic syndrome and 
composite metabolic scores. For blood pressure, the evidence 
was particularly inconsistent, even between separate analyses of 
NHANES data.
Prospective studies
Eligible articles included 17 prospective studies (online supple-
mentary table S4). The majority of those (n=12) reported asso-
ciations between LIPA and all-cause mortality, including four 
different analyses of the NHANES data set.46–50 Five articles 
studied the association between LIPA and incidence of cardiomet-
abolic diseases (type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome), one 
investigated change in glycaemia and one studied the change 
in adiposity. No relationship was found between time spent in 
LIPA and metabolic syndrome.51 Mekary et al showed a small 
decrease in body weight to be associated with increase in time 
spent in LIPA.52 A significant reduction in risk of developing 
type 2 diabetes (HR 0.60; 
95% CI 0.40 to 0.91) was reported 
with higher time spent in LIPA in a study of over 14 000 Finnish 
men and women,53 but no significant longitudinal improvements 
in glycaemia and insulin resistance were found in a much smaller 
study of n=192 participants.54 In contrast with these mixed 
results, studies with all-cause mortality as the outcome over-
whelmingly reported significant beneficial associations. Results 
from five mortality studies could be pooled into a meta-analysis. 
The results presented in figure 3 show a pooled 29% reduction 
(95% CI −17% to –38%) in HR of mortality for longer time 
spent in LIPA (equivalent to a 29% reduction in HR for doubling 
the time spent in LIPA). Sensitivity analysis of the meta-analysis 
revealed that this result was robust. The results heterogeneity 
was moderate but significant (p=0.05; I²=57%). The heteroge-
neity can be traced to the two studies which used self-reported 
LIPA time55 56 rather than objective measures in the other three. 
It should be noted that three potentially eligible studies46–48 
were not included in the meta-analysis. Three of them were 
excluded46–48 because they used the same NHANES data set 
as Matthews et al’s study50 which scored higher in terms of

quality rating. These three studies showed different results46–48 
for the same data set suggesting that conclusions are sensitive to 
different analytical approaches.
Risk of bias and heterogeneity
No major risk of bias was detected using QUALSYST or on exam-
ination of the funnel plots (online supplementary figures S1–S4). 
These show some asymmetry but it is unlikely to be due to publica-
tion bias. This heterogeneity is more probably due to methodolog-
ical and sample heterogeneity in the studies considered than a real 
heterogeneity in results. Sources of methodological heterogeneity 
are the mixed methods used to measure light activity as studies 
included used both subjective and objective measures. In addition, 
different cut-point and thresholds were used to define the upper 
limit of light activity as 3 METs, between studies.
DIsCussIon
This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to investi-
gate the relationship between LIPA and cardiometabolic health 
and all-cause mortality across a range of research designs. While 
relatively limited in volume, the evidence examining the relation-
ship between LIPA and cardiometabolic outcomes points towards 
acute positive effects on glucose and insulin and possibly all-cause 
mortality risk reduction. There seems to be limited evidence 
suggesting such effects on lipids and other cardiovascular risk 
factors. The observational evidence is less clear with the large 
majority of studies being cross-sectional while the limited number 
of prospective studies points towards beneficial associations with 
cardiovascular risks.
In spite of these limitations of the evidence base the results of our 
overall synthesis offer some support to the notion that submoderate 
intensities of physical activity have mortality and perhaps cardio-
vascular risk reduction properties. Few studies directly contrasted 
the effect size of LIPA and MVPA but overall the effects reported 
for LIPA are between two and four times smaller than for the same 
amount of time spent in MVPA. For example, Matthews et al49 
found an HR for mortality of 0.68 for an increase of 1 
hour of LIPA 
compared with the reference group while it was 0.33 for 1 
hour of 
MVPA. Similarly, experimentally Paoli et al42 found between two 
and four times stronger effects for MVPA in their physical activity 
intervention programme.
MVPA appears to have a more potent effect on cardiometa-
bolic health than LIPA per unit of time. However, various barriers 
to achieving the minimum recommended 150 
min of MVPA per 
week may make LIPA an easier to initiate option for certain popu-
lation groups, including elderly, frail, some functionally compro-
mised individuals, and those who are particularly inactive. It seems 
that the effect of light activity might be stronger in metabolically 
impaired individuals, although the difference was not statistically 
significant. In addition, the study by McCarthy et al28 reports that 
fitness moderates the effect of light activity, suggesting again that 
light activity might be more beneficial to impaired individuals. The 
theoretically, at least, potential of LIPA is that it might be more 
feasible and accessible, requiring less motivation for largest part 
of the population. Most LIPA is incidental to daily living and does 
not require high level of starting fitness or exercise skills. While it is 
less potent than MVPA there is potentially a larger ‘time reservoir’ 
to tap into. LIPA might be a pragmatic additional target for future 
interventions and public health guidelines.
Interestingly, the move towards promoting moderate-intensity 
activity through the public health guidelines57 was initially also 
a pragmatic decision with feasibility and accessibility at its core. 
At the time, while the evidence from exercise physiology showed 
that vigorous activity had optimal physiological effects, it was 
felt that the promotion of moderate-intensity activities like brisk 
walking was more likely to be feasible for larger parts of the 
population. Ever since, guidelines and interventions have been 
encouraging individuals to make up the deficit in activity volume 
during their leisure time through engaging in MVPA. From the 
public health perspective and assuming that the LIPA evidence 
base will develop adequately in the years to come, a similar feasi-
bility-centred argument could be extended to LIPA.
biological mechanisms
The results of our review should be viewed through the limited 
mechanistic information explaining any observed associations and 
effects of LIPA in humans. A previously proposed animal-based 
mechanism stated that, compared with muscular inertia, there is 
substantial increase in lipoprotein lipase activity during light ambu-
lation, suggesting that LIPA might be facilitating better metabolism 
of circulating lipids.58 This mechanism was proposed in 200358 but 
has not been verified in humans and as such it is unknown if it can 
explain the epidemiological and experimental literature findings 
on the whole. Sedentary behaviour-focused paradigms that could 
lend mechanistic insights of the vascular, cellular and metabolic 
LIPA pathways of action are also still at hypothesis level.58
Implications for practice
Increase in LIPA can occur through activities of daily living at 
work, home and during transportation and could potentially 
be achieved with less onus on the individual by promoting a 
physical environment and culture conducive to movement and 
activity. Our review suggests that maintaining or/and increasing 
daily levels of LIPA may have health-promoting potential. With 
very few exceptions,59 current guidelines5 6 do not explicitly 
recommend LIPA because at the time of their development 
there was a near absence of evidence. Our review provides the 
first synthesis consolidating evidence from different studies 
on the potential of the largest time component of daily phys-
ical activity for primary prevention. However, the evidence 
remains currently limited.
Implications for research
Our results showed that LIPA may have beneficial health effects 
but also highlighted important gaps of the evidence base. 
Ascertaining the dose–response relationships between volume 
of LIPA and different health outcomes will require careful 
long-term experimentation to provide targets for intervention 
and policy. Greater attention needs to be directed to inter-
actions with time spent in other components of the 24-hour 
physical activity continuum, such as MVPA and sleep seden-
tary behaviours. This may require novel analytical approaches 
capable of dealing with the compositional nature of the whole 
24 hours.60 The body of evidence of acute experimental trials 
showing consistent effects of LIPA bouts on insulin and glucose 
(figure 2) provides useful direction for future mechanistic 
studies. Advances in objective physical activity measures and 
more accurate activity type classification and recognition are 
likely to improve substantially our understanding on health 
attributes of LIPA in the near future.
study strengths and limitations
The main strength of this study is that it considers a wide range 
of evidence from acute effects to long-term exposure. The main 
limitation of this review and meta-analysis is the relatively small 
amount of evidence found for some designs and its heterogeneity.

Review
Indeed, heterogeneity metrics for the meta-analyses are all high, 
which calls for caution in drawing quantitative conclusions. 
However, this is not surprising considering the relative novelty 
of this line of investigation. One of the main difficulties is the 
lack of a standardised definition and operationalisation of LIPA, 
which might be addressed in the future with more standardised 
definitions.60 The comprehensive search methodology that 
includes multiple rounds of manual searches deployed to address 
this issue is another strength of this study.
ConCLusIon
Our combined meta-analytical and best evidence synthesis found 
some evidence that light-intensity activity is associated with 
beneficial acute and long-term cardiometabolic responses and 
lower risk of mortality. Nevertheless, the moderate consistency 
between observational and laboratory evidence and the absence 
of an established biological mechanism inhibits definitive conclu-
sions. Future research should seek to further build an evidence 
base that will confidently inform public health and clinical 
recommendations on submoderate physical activity intensities. 
Essential steps towards this goal will be to (A) shed further light 
on the long-term health effects and mechanisms of light-intensity 
activity and (B) identify optimal ways to promote light-intensity 
activity for public health purposes.
What is already known?
 
► There is an L-shaped dose–response between total volume of 
physical activity and health.
 
► Leisure-time moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity 
is recommended by most public health guidelines.
What are the new findings?
 
► Frequent short bouts of light-intensity activity may have acute 
beneficial physiological effects, particularly in individuals with 
metabolic impairments.
 
► There is a moderate amount of consistent (mostly cross-
sectional) epidemiological evidence showing that more time 
spent daily in light-intensity activity is associated with better 
cardiometabolic health outcomes; and some prospective 
epidemiological evidence that points towards decreased risks 
of all-cause mortality.
Implication of practice
 
► In addition to meeting established guidelines for moderate 
to vigorous physical activity, practitioners could consider 
advising patients to increase daily light physical activity.
 
► In situations where moderate-intensity activity is not a 
feasible option, there is merit to shifting the onus from 
encouraging individuals to partly make up the deficit 
of physical activity during their leisure time with more 
movement in daily lives.
