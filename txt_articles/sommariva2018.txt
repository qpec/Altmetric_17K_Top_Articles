ABSTRACT
Background: The importance of social networking sites (SNSs) as platforms to engage in the
correction of “fake news” has been documented widely. More evidence is needed to understand
the popularity of health-related rumors and how Health Educators can optimize their use of SNSs.
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the spread of health rumors and verified
information on SNSs using the Zika virus as a case study. Methods: A content analysis of Zika-
related news stories on SNSs between February 2016 and January 2017 was conducted to verify
accuracy (phase 1). Phase 1 was followed by an analysis of volume of shares (phase 2) and a
thematic analysis of headlines (phase 3). Results: Rumors had three times more shares than
verified stories. Popular rumors portray Zika as a conspiracy against the public and a low-risk issue
and connect it to the use of pesticides. Discussion: This study identifies the value of integrating
in-depth analysis of popular health-related rumors into the development of communication
strategies. Translation to Health Education Practice: Misinformation on SNSs can hinder disease
prevention efforts. This study shows how information circulating on SNSs can be analyzed from a
quantitative and qualitative standpoint to help Health Educators maximize the use of online
communication platforms.

Background
Over the past decade, social networking sites (SNSs),
which are Web-based services that allow users to cre-
ate a profile and connect with other individuals within
the system,1 have emerged as powerful health commu-
nication platforms.2,3 With more people relying on
SNSs for news,4,5 these platforms act as a primary
bridge between individuals and news sources, aggre-
gating traditional and nontraditional media into one
convenient feed.6 Due to their configuration, SNSs
force Health Educators to move beyond the linearity
of traditional communication frameworks and rethink
the role of audience members as receiver-sources
empowered by the platform to amplify, modify, and
generate original messages.7,8 The potential of SNSs to
empower patients and communities has been increas-
ingly recognized.9 Because empowerment is linked to
informed decision making,10 Health Educators who
engage in communication and promotion efforts on
SNSs are motivated to capitalize on the uniqueness of
these platforms, going beyond the use of social media
pages as “bulletin boards” and promoting users as
distributors of accurate message.11
On SNSs, users can share content regardless of accu-
racy and, in some cases, reach as many readers as
traditional media without filtering from third parties
like editors or fact-checkers.12
An increasingly documented component impacting
information-sharing on SNSs is the so-called “fake
news” phenomenon, although a unified definition of
fake news is being actively debated and the term has
been misused often.13,14 The Harvard Kennedy School’s
Shorenstein Center defines fake news as “misinforma-
tion that has the trappings of traditional news media,
with the presumed associated editorial processes,”
recognizing the need for the development of a nomen-
clature to help scholars study this phenomenon.13,15
The effect of fake news on public discourse has been
documented extensively, predominantly with respect to
the practice of journalism, the political discourse and
the election cycle.12,16-20 Though research has analyzed
the importance of SNSs as platforms to engage in

 correction of inaccurate health information,21,22 more
evidence is needed regarding what drives people to
share
fake
news
and
which
strategies
Health
Educators
can
adopt
to
counter
this
behavior.
Knowledge of the extent to which users are exposed
to and decide to share messages of varying levels of
accuracy on a given health topic is particularly crucial
during outbreaks and public health emergencies, when
educators are under pressure to address people’s con-
cerns on the risks they face and promote disease-pre-
ventive behaviors.
A recent health crisis where risk communication has
been challenging is the concurrent spread of the Zika
virus in the Americas during 2015 and 2016.23-26
Traditionally, health authorities have not been con-
cerned with Zika due to its habitually mild symptoms
and low mortality that result from the infection.27,28
The lack of concern changed once evidence of a possi-
ble link between the infection and neonatal malforma-
tions emerged in late 2015.26,29 Studies later showed
that the spread of Zika virus may be linked to an
increase in incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome in
adults
as
well
as
neurological
abnormalities
in
newborns.30,31 Though not a chronic disease per se,
the Zika virus might cause long-lasting consequences
on the neurological system.32,33
In response to immediate recommendations of the
World
Health
Organization’s
(WHO)
Emergency
Committee, a dramatic rise of “risk communications”
occurred in the countries affected to address the con-
cerns of the public.34,35 As a result, public health autho-
rities launched information campaigns promoting a
shift in disease prevention, such as “Drain and Cover”
in the United States and “Zika Zero” in Brazil.36,37
These campaigns were targeting specific behaviors; for
instance, promoting the use of mosquito repellant, dis-
posal of stagnant water, and use of protection during
sexual intercourse. Alongside communication efforts by
health professionals, a wide range of Zika-centered
rumors spread across SNSs. This phenomenon even
led the WHO to publish a web post titled “Dispelling
Rumors Around Zika and Complications” to provide
guidance
over
the
state
of
available
evidence.38
Therefore, we consider the Zika virus as an ideal case
study to analyze the dynamics of health information
and misinformation on social media.
Purpose
The purpose of this article was to explore the spread of
health messages through SNSs, highlighting the role of
the fake news phenomenon in health communication
and
education.
Using
data
on
the
volume
of
engagements (eg, number of “likes”) and shares (num-
ber of times the article has been shared) of news stories
about the Zika virus on different SNSs platforms, this
study aimed to (1) identify the most widely circulated
news stories in 2016, (2) quantify the spread of rumors
and verified news stories, and (3) qualitatively analyze
the headlines of these stories to determine potential
determinants of their popularity. Study results provide
insight on how Health Educators can maximize SNSs as
communication platforms to convey accurate messages
and counter the spread of health-related rumors.
Methods
We used a sequential mixed-methods approach to con-
duct this study, with each phase of the study building
on the results of the previous phase.39 A qualitative
content analysis of news stories was conducted to
determine accuracy (journalistically referred to as
“fact-checking”). We followed the analysis by a quanti-
tative analysis of news stories’ engagements. Lastly, we
conducted a thematic analysis of the headlines.
Data collection
This study analyzed data obtained using the social
media content analysis tool Buzzsumo, which quantifies
the reach of information across several SNSs. Data
include volume of engagements or shares of the most
popular content (Web links) on SNSs (Facebook,
LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest, GooglePlus) that can be
searched by keyword. Thus, this study used engage-
ments
(Facebook)
and
shares
(LinkedIn,
Twitter,
Pinterest, GooglePlus) as “shares” in presenting our
findings.
Keywords
used
during
the
search
in
Buzzsumo were “Zika” and “Zika virus.” We retrieved
monthly data for the top 10 Zika-related stories by
popularity for the period from February 2016, when
the WHO declared Zika a public health emergency of
international concern, to January 2017. Overall, a sam-
ple of 120 stories was analyzed (top 10 for each month
over a 12-month period). Popularity was measured by
the number of times a specific story’s web link was
shared across the SNSs monitored by Buzzsumo. Data
were collected for all English-language sources.
Fake news classification system
The nomenclature and fake news classification system
developed by Wardle14 guided the data analysis.
Subsequently, this study distinguished Zika-related
news stories as belonging to three main categories.
The first category is verified news stories, which
2
S. SOMMARIVA ET AL.
 represent content backed by the latest evidence and
presented accurately. The second category is rumors.
The WHO has used this term to generally refer to Zika-
related information not backed by evidence.38 For this
study, rumors include three of the following subcate-
gories: (1) misleading content describes news stories
that inaccurately use information to frame an issue or
an individual (this includes Wardle’s categories of mis-
leading content, false context, manipulated context); (2)
false connection (similarly to Wardle’s category) is the
mismatch between headline and content, where the
content may be accurate but the headline is deceiving;
and (3) fabricated content indicates material that is
completely fake and not backed by evidence (similar
to Wardle’s category). The third category Wardle devel-
oped is satire or parody, which are stories aimed at
producing a comic effect. Wardle also defined the cate-
gory “imposter content,” which refers to the attributes
of the source of the news story rather than the content
of the news story itself. This category was excluded
because an in-depth analysis of the sources that pro-
duce fake news is beyond the scope of this study.
Data analysis
Phase 1
After the sample was collected, the content of Zika-
related news stories were analyzed to determine accu-
racy. News stories were categorized as (1) “verified,” (2)
“rumor” (which was subcategorized as “misleading
content,” “false connection” or “fabricated content”),
and (3) “satire.” To determine accuracy, the content
of stories was compared to the evidence made available
by official health authorities reporting. One such docu-
ment was the WHO’s “Dispelling Rumors Around Zika
and Complications” article.38 This fact-checking pro-
cess was carried out by one author (SS), and a random
sample (20% of news stories) was checked by a second
author (AM). Both co-authors are experienced fact-
checkers, formerly employed by professional fact-
checking projects. Intercoder reliability for the fact-
checking process of news stories’ content was 100%.
In this phase, the two authors also coded the
sources of the news stories using the following
nomenclature: “legacy media,” “digital media,” “alter-
native media” and “scientific/institutions.” Media out-
lets that were nondigital at launch (eg, broadcast,
print) were categorized as “legacy media” and news
sources that launched online and exclusively publish
on that medium were categorized as “digital media” or
“alternative media.” The difference between the two is
that digital media maintain an editorial structure and
verification
process
similar
to
that
of
print
newspapers, whereas alternative media are mostly
run as individual or collective blogs. Scientific institu-
tions, governmental authorities, and research centers
were classified as “scientific/institutions.”
Phase 2
A descriptive quantitative analysis of the volume of
shares per news story was conducted. Volumes were
analyzed by source and type of news story. Analysis of
the volume of shares was conducted using Microsoft
Excel. The analysis was conducted on annual data
(February 2016–January 2017) and monthly volumes.
Phase 3
Finally, a thematic analysis of the headlines of all news
stories was performed to explore the characteristics that
drive stories’ popularity on social media. The analysis
was performed on headlines only, rather than on the
entire story content, because previous research has
shown that users often share links they have not
opened. For example, one study on social clicks on
Twitter found that more than half (59%) of the links
are shared by users without being opened.40 All head-
lines of sampled news stories were coded using a code-
book.
The
codebook
was
developed
iteratively,
composed of a priori and emerging codes.41,42 For
each code, the codebook detailed the inclusion and
exclusion criteria, a description of the code, and typical
exemplars and atypical exemplars of news stories that
would fall under the code “close but no” (indicating
material that could be categorized mistakenly under
that code) and subcodes.43 One author (SS) coded all
of the headlines and two co-authors (DMT, CV) cumu-
latively coded a random sample of 20% of the head-
lines. Analysis of shares was subsequently conducted by
coding for verified stories and rumors to explore the
characteristics driving stories’ popularity and neglected
aspects of the Zika crisis. Intercoder reliability for the
coding process was 91%.
Results
Popular Zika-related news stories
A total of 120 news stories were analyzed. The peak
of interest in Zika-related news stories during the
study period occurred following the declaration of a
public health emergency of international concern by
the WHO in February 2016. During the year, the
reach of Zika-related news stories declined, with a
slight rise over the summer period in conjunction
with the Brazil Olympics (which raised concerns
around travel safety) and congressional approval of

 the medical satirical website GomerBlog was categor-
ized as satirical/parody. Given that only one story was
categorized as satirical, the analysis focused on two
categories: rumors and verified news stories. Among
the rumors, fabricated content represented the largest
share (81%), followed by misleading content (16%) and
false connection (3%). Rumors obtained, on average,
three times more shares than verified stories, as shown
in Figure 2.
As illustrated in Figure 3, the proportion of rumors
dropped substantially over the course of the period
considered. The decline in reach of rumors was con-
current with the overall decline in shares of Zika-
related news stories. As users’ interest in Zika faded,
verified stories represented a higher proportion of the
overall number of shares for Zika-related news stories.
Alternative media had the highest performance in
terms of average reach of news stories, followed by
digital media, legacy media, and scientific organizations
or institutions. For alternative and legacy media, news
stories classified as rumors were shared more often
than verified stories (see Figure 4). All news stories
from digital media and scientific institutions were
verified.
Popularity of news stories
Examining the number of stories per code (Table 2),
most rumors portrayed Zika as a conspiracy against the
public (approximately 20% of the total) or as a low-risk
issue (approximately 15%) or discussed the role of
pesticides in the epidemic (about 10%). Headlines of

of new cases of the virus (approximately 15%) and

or

(5%).
Fifteen stories explicitly referred to women and two
stories addressed concerns related to men’s health.
When considering the average number of shares by
code (Table 3), the most popular rumors had headlines
that covered issues such as blame (often associated with
the actor or organization to be blamed) and pesticides.
Headlines from the most popular verified stories also
covered the role of pesticides in the crisis and, to a
lesser extent, issues around disease prevention.
Discussion
This study explored the spread of health information
through SNSs, highlighting the role of the fake news
phenomenon in Health Education practice. Fake news
is not a concern unique to SNSs; however, our analysis
showed that misinformation finds fertile soil in the
fast-paced social media ecosystem, where the abun-
dance of news sources and SNS platform structures
can help misinformation reach a large audience.13 In
the case study used in this article, the prevalence of
health-related fake news in the social media landscape
is substantial and cannot be disregarded. For instance,
this study found that among the top 10 news stories
about the Zika virus in 2016 (Table 1), half were
classifiable as rumors. Data in this analysis also sug-
gested a positive relationship between the popularity
of a topic and the appearance of fake news related to
that same topic. In fact, while Zika was a popular topic
on SNSs such as Facebook and Twitter, rumors such
as the connection between larvicides and microce-
phaly and the alleged contribution of the mass release
of sterilized male mosquitoes to the spread of Zika in
Brazil38 were circulated widely despite having been
already disproven by fact-checkers.44 Among the top
stories, shares of rumors outnumbered shares of ver-
ified stories by four to one.
These findings underscore the need for Health
Educators to analyze misinformation and develop and
implement information campaigns in the very early
stages of social media strategy development. Early
intervention can be beneficial in two ways. One,
promptly exposing users to correct information can
trigger social correction, which has been shown to be
a
viable
strategy
to
counter
misinformation.21,45
Monsanto, the multinational agrochemical corporation,
adopted this strategy to counter a Zika-related rumor
concerning its pesticides (see story 4 in Table 1).46
Second, an early understanding of rumors rising in
popularity provides SNSs with information that can
be used to flag misleading stories and reduce their
visibility by adjusting algorithms. SNSs, most notably
Facebook, recently have introduced strategies to reduce
the visibility of fabricated information on their plat-
forms by building on the work of fact-checkers and
experts.47,48
Furthermore, the content analysis of news stories
conducted in this study suggests that moving beyond
the mere analysis of volumes of shares and engage-
ments is crucial to gaining an in-depth understanding
of popular rumors and developing effective social
media health communication strategies. For instance,
several fabricated stories portrayed Zika as a low-risk
issue; however, this type of framing did not appear in
verified stories. Such framing represents a threat to the
implementation of disease prevention efforts and pre-
vention behaviors, because the virus may not be per-
ceived by the public as a public health priority. This
understanding could prompt Health Educators not only
to disseminate content that refutes the “low-risk” view
but also to try to meet the information needs of users
by promoting accurate content on the risks of Zika.
Moreover, information on which topics have been
neglected in the social media debate would prove help-
ful to redirect communication efforts toward less-dis-
cussed issues. In our study, for instance, few verified
news stories explicitly addressed the impact of Zika on
men’s health, which suggests the need for Health
Educators to focus on risk-related messages that target
the male population.
Research on social media health information cam-
paigns shows that it cannot be presumed that commu-
nication efforts on SNSs will necessarily reach a large
audience just because these platforms have a wide user
base. In some cases, SNSs campaigns have proven to be

 ineffective.49-51 The ineffectiveness can be due to the
overload of competing messages that circulate on social
media,52 which can reduce visibility of public health
information. Rumors are part of this highly competitive
landscape. Misinformation is a by-product of SNSs,
where health campaigns face a constant trade-off
between reach and control.11 This trade-off is particu-
larly true when health professionals share information
on unfolding crises and events, where evidence is con-
stantly updated and information circulates at a faster
pace.53 Therefore, it can be hard to distinguish relevant
information from background noise or fabricated
information.54
Inherent challenges exist for Health Educators and
other public health professionals in addressing the fake
news phenomenon. Pretesting messages is an important
part of health communication practices.55,56 Pretesting
may inject a time lag between the spread of rumors and
the diffusion of messages that address health-related mis-
information. Still, integrating early analysis of rumors as a
formal step in the development of communication stra-
tegies on social media could help Health Educators
understand competing messages on SNSs and increase
the reach of verified information among users.
Despite providing insights on the spread of health
messages through SNSs, this work presents several lim-
itations. First, the data included news stories published
by different media sources as separate news stories,
even when the topic covered by the story was the
same. For instance, if two media outlets published two
articles reporting the same rumor on Zika and vaccines,
they were counted twice. Though this approach did not
affect our findings on the average volume of shares, it
may have skewed our results on the popularity of the-
matic codes. Second, though informed by the current
debate on fake news,14 the categorization used to
describe this phenomenon needs to be further validated
in the academic literature. Still, the categorization used
in this article presents a systematic way to operationa-
lize stories for analysis. Third, the decision to conduct
the content analysis on news headlines instead of full
articles was based on an assumption (that the content
of the headline was the main driver of popularity)
proven in one study40 but on which academic evidence
is still limited. Fourth, the use of Buzzsumo is largely
untested in the academic realm; therefore, potential
limitations to its application may emerge. Moreover,
among all SNSs considered, Facebook presents a sig-
nificantly higher volume of shares; thus, our findings
on fake news as a phenomenon were largely related to
this platform.
Results from this analysis provide relevant insights
on SNSs as platforms where Health Educators can
disseminate accurate information. These findings can
be of interest for public health professionals who want
to further leverage SNSs to promote disease prevention.
Though the centrality of users as drivers of content on
SNSs is well understood,57,58 this study proposed and
identified the value of integrating an in-depth analysis
of popular rumors into the development of Health
Education strategies.
Translation to Health Education Practice
Social networking sites represent an opportunity for
Health Educators to promote user engagement and
empowerment with respect to important public health
issues and increase reach to target populations, particularly
among vulnerable groups.59 However, the wider diffusion
of health-related messages is not necessarily positive if the
quality and accuracy of information are poor.
In this context, a first set of implications for health
educators relates to the need for an understanding of
popular fake news content circulating on core public
health issues that extends beyond the quantitative study
of volume of reach and engagements to provide in-
depth qualitative understanding. Knowledge of rumors
circulating on a given topic represents key information
that can be incorporated into the development of mes-
sages. For instance, knowing that popular misinforma-
tion focuses on portraying Zika virus as a low-risk issue
for men might lead institutions informing the public to
consider tailoring their communication strategy in
order to reach male audiences with messaging on risk
perception.
A second implication relates to the potential for
public Health Educators and promoters to engage
with SNSs in improving the reach of accurate informa-
tion. In particular, during public health crises, health
professionals might consider working with professional
fact-checkers in the context of their partnership with
Facebook to flag and reduce the reach of false content.
Finally, the fast-paced spread of misinformation
allowed by SNSs calls for fast-tracking testing processes
for health messages and educational materials. SNSs
can, in that sense, serve as the cause and the cure for
this problem. For instance, public health professionals
should leverage SNSs tools to test messages iteratively
by using split testing, which allows to obtain immediate
feedback from users on which messages work best.
Ultimately, fighting misinformation on social media
is key to the promotion of media literacy, defined as the
ability to critically evaluate health messages.60 Social
media can be instrumental to promote health literacy.61
Promoting the integration of social media in health
literacy strategies can, however, be ineffective if not

 accompanied by an awareness of the magnitude and
characteristics of the misinformation problem. This
