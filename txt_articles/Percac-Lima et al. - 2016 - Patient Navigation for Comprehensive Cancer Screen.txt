IMPORTANCE Patient navigation (PN) to improve cancer screening in low-income and
racial/ethnic minority populations usually focuses on navigating for single cancers in
community health center settings.
OBJECTIVE We evaluated PN for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening using a
population-based information technology (IT) system within a primary care network.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial conducted from April 2014 to
December 2014 in 18 practices in an academic primary care network. All patients eligible and
overdue for cancer screening were identified and managed using a population-based IT
system. Those at high risk for nonadherence with completing screening were identified using
an electronic algorithm (language spoken, number of overdue tests, no-show visit history),
and randomized to a PN intervention (n = 792) or usual care (n = 820). Navigators used the
IT system to track patients, contact them, and provide intense outreach to help them
complete cancer screening.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean cancer screening test completion rate over 8-month
trial for each eligible patient, with all overdue cancer screening tests combined using linear
regression models. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients completing any
and each overdue cancer screening test.
RESULTS Among 1612 patients (673 men and 975 women; median age, 57 years), baseline
patient characteristics were similar among randomized groups. Of 792 intervention patients,
patient navigators were unable to reach 151 (19%), deferred 246 (38%) (eg, patient declined,
competing comorbidity), and navigated 202 (32%). The mean proportion of patients who
were up to date with screening among all overdue screening examinations was higher in the
intervention vs the control group for all cancers combined (10.2% vs 6.8%; 95% CI [for the
difference], 1.5%-5.2%; P < .001), and for breast (14.7% vs 11.0%; 95% CI, 0.2%-7.3%;
P = .04), cervical (11.1% vs 5.7%; 95% CI, 0.8%-5.2%; P = .002), and colon (7.6% vs 4.6%;
95% CI, 0.8%-5.2%; P = .01) cancer compared with control. The proportion of overdue
patients who completed any cancer screening during follow-up was higher in the intervention
group (25.5% vs 17.0%; 95% CI, 4.7%-12.7%; P < .001). The intervention group had more
patients completing screening for breast (23.4% vs 16.6%; 95% CI, 1.8%-12.0%; P = .009),
cervical (14.4% vs 8.6%; 95% CI, 1.6%-10.5%; P = .007), and colorectal (13.7% vs 7.0%; 95%
CI, 3.2%-10.4%; P < .001) cancer.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patient navigation as part of a population-based IT system
significantly increased screening rates for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer in patients at
high risk for nonadherence with testing. Integrating patient navigation into population health
management activities for low-income and racial/ethnic minority patients might improve
equity of cancer care.

D
espite advances in screening, abnormal test follow-
up, and treatment, cancer morbidity and mortality
rates for screened cancers are still high, particularly for
low-income patients and racial/ethnic minorities.1,2 Patient
navigation (PN) has been shown to improve rates of cancer
screening in low income and racial/ethnic minority
populations.3-10 Patient navigators assist patients in access-
ing care and guide them through the health care system, help-
ing them overcome identified individual barriers.11-14 Though
PN programs usually focus on a single cancer,3-10,15 many pa-
tients may be overdue for more than 1 cancer screening test.
In addition, most cancer PN programs are located in commu-
nity health centers or in safety net hospital networks.3-5,8 How-
ever, high-risk patients receiving care in settings without on-
site PN may not get screened and contribute to persistent
cancer care disparities.16
The Affordable Care Act includes provisions that support
population health management activities as part of fostering
accountable care organizations.17 Population-based pro-
grams have been used to increase colorectal cancer (CRC)
screening.18 In 2011, a nonâ€“visit-based information technol-
ogy (IT)-enabled population management system was imple-
mented in a large, diverse, academic primary care network to
perform preventive cancer screening.19,20 Seeking to im-
prove equity in cancer screening in high-risk patients, an ex-
istingPNprograminacommunityhealthcenterwithinthenet-
work was expanded to enable navigation of patients at high
risk for screening nonadherence in all practices. The PN pro-
gram was designed to function as a part of the existing popu-
lation management system.8,21
The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of
population-based,IT-enabledPNforcomprehensivebreast,cer-
vical,and/orCRCscreeninginlow-incomeandracial/ethnicmi-

Study Population and Randomization
To identify patients at high risk for not completing screening
(nonadherence), we developed an algorithm using pilot data
obtained during the first year the IT system was imple-
mented. The algorithm used patient no-show visit history (any
no-show visit in the prior year, 1 point), primary language spo-
ken (non-English speaking, 1 point), and number of overdue
screening tests (1, 2, or 3 points). Female patients with at least
3 points and male patients with at least 2 points were consid-
ered to be at high risk for nonadherence.
We identified 1956 patients at high-risk for nonadherence
with cancer screening who were overdue for at least 1 cancer
screening test. We excluded 330 patients who received care at
the community health center with the existing PN program.
Based on our previous PN studies,8 we estimated that over the

Key Points
Question What effect does patient navigation using a
population-based information technology (IT) system within a
primary care network have on screening rates for breast, cervical,
and colorectal cancer among patients at high risk for
non-adherence with screening?
Findings The mean proportion of patients who were up to date
with screening among all overdue screening examinations was
higher in the intervention vs the control group for all cancers
combined, suggesting that using patient navigation as part of a
population-based IT system significantly increases screening rates
for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer in patients at high risk for
nonadherence with testing.
Meaning Using patient navigators who are integrated into
population health management activities for patients at high risk
for screening nonadherence within a practice network may
improve equity of cancer care.

Patient Navigation (Intervention Group)
Four part-time, college graduate, patient navigators (2 full-
time equivalent), each fluent in 2 to 5 languages, were trained
inmotivationalinterviewing,problemsolving,goalsetting,use
of the IT system, electronic medical record documentation, as
well as health modules on breast, cervical, and CRC screen-
ing. Navigators used in this study had at least 2 years of expe-
rience with cancer navigation and continued to work 50% of
their time in other established cancer PN programs in our in-
stitution. A procedure manual was created to ensure consis-
tency across the navigation team. For each type of screening,
the manual outlined phone scripts, talking points, time frame
of outreach calls, templates to facilitate documentation in the
medical record, and communication with clinicians.
Patients randomized to the intervention group were trans-
ferred to a navigator roster within the IT application for the
8-month study period. Navigators used the IT system to track
thesepatients,contactthemintheirownlanguage,andprovide
intense outreach to help them complete cancer screening. We

Usual Care (Control Group)
Patients randomized to the control group received usual care,
which included visit-based reminders within the electronic
health record, and nonâ€“visit-based outreach by clinicians and
staff using the IT application to send patients reminder let-
ters about their overdue cancer screening examinations, call
to schedule overdue examinations, or document appropriate
reasons for deferral or exclusion.19

HealthCare.26 Dates of completion for mammograms,
Papanicolaou/HPV tests, and CRC screening tests were
obtained from electronic reports or billing data.
The primary outcome was the mean cancer screening
test completion rate over the follow-up period for each eli-
gible patient, with all eligible cancers combined in intention-
to-treat analyses. The cancer screening test completion rate
for each patient was calculated daily, then averaged across
the 8-month study period. On any given day, the screening
test completion rate was calculated as the number of tests
completed divided by the number of eligible tests. We also
calculated the completion rate for each individual cancer in
the same manner, which translates into the percentage of
time screening was up to date during follow-up for each
patient. Secondary outcomes included assessing the propor-
tion of patients completing any and each cancer screening
during follow-up among those who were eligible and over-
due for at least 1 cancer screening at baseline in intention-
to-treat analyses. In addition, we conducted as-treated
analyses where we removed patients who left our primary
care network or who died during follow-up from both inter-
vention and control groups, and also removed patients that
the navigators were not able to contact from the interven-
tion group. We compared the primary outcomes in interven-
tion and control patients within relevant subgroups and cal-
culated rate differences and 95% CIs. Patient subgroups
were defined by race, primary language, insurance, practice
type (community health center vs not), sex, and age.
Statistical Analyses
We used the generalized estimating equations (GEE) ap-
proach to take into account the clustering of patient data. The
physician was considered the unit of cluster for patients con-
nected with a specific primary care physician (PCP), and the
practice was considered the unit of cluster for patients who
could be connected with a practice but not a specific PCP.27 For
the primary outcome (both intention-to-treat and as-treated
analyses),linearregressionmodelswithGEEwereusedtocom-
pare the mean completion rate between intervention and con-
trol patients for all cancer screening examinations combined
and for each individual screening examination. For second-
ary outcomes (both intention-to-treat and as-treated analy-
ses), logistic regression models with GEE were used to com-
pare the proportion of completed screening tests between
intervention and control patients. We conducted a post hoc
power analysis. With an intraclass coefficient of 0.044, an av-
erage cluster size of 6, and a total of 1612 patients in the inten-
tion-to-treat analysis, the design effect was estimated to be 1.2.
The study had 80% power to detect a mean difference of 3.1%
in mean completion rate for all cancer screening examina-
tions combined. Analyses were conducted using PROC
GENMOD, SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Insti-
tute).
Results
At baseline, 792 patients were randomized and eligible for
the intervention group, and 820 patients were randomized

and eligible for the control group (Figure 1). Patient charac-
teristics, including age, sex, primary language, insurance,
proportion of patients connected to a specific physician or
seen in a community health center, number of clinic visits
over the prior 3-years, and risk for nonadherence score were
similar between intervention and control groups (Table 1).
Among 1612 overdue patients, 46% were overdue for 1
screening, 18% were overdue for 2 screenings, and 36% were
overdue for 3 screenings at baseline with a similar distribu-
tion among intervention and control groups.
Among 792 intervention patients, 151 (19%) could not be
contacted (mean, 3.3 telephone calls per patient). Among the
remaining 641 patients, 246 (38%) were deferred for all over-
due cancers (eg, patient declined [n = 96], screening com-
pleted elsewhere [n = 73], no longer a patient of the practice
[n = 40],competingcomorbidity[n = 29],anatomicallynotap-
plicable [n = 5], deceased [n = 3]), and 202 (32%) success-
fully completed at least 1 overdue cancer screening test (total
252 screening tests; 102 for breast, 57 for cervical, and 93 for
colorectal cancer).
Among patients eligible and overdue for cancer screen-
ing, the primary outcome, mean cancer-screening comple-
tion rates, was higher in the intervention group compared
with the control group for all cancers combined and for each
individual cancer screening examination (Table 2). In
intention-to-treat analyses, intervention patients had a
mean cancer screening completion rate 3.4% (95% CI, 1.5%-
5.2%; P < .001) higher for all cancer screening examinations
combined, and 3.7% (95% CI, 0.2%-7.3%; P = .04) higher for
breast, 5.4% (95% CI, 2.1%-9.2%; P = .002) higher for cervi-
cal, and 3.0% (95% CI, 0.8%-5.2%; P = .01) higher for colo-
rectal compared with patients in the control group. For colo-
rectal cancer screening, the difference was greater in women
(4.6%; 95% CI, 1.7%-7.5%; P = .002) than in men (1.2%; 95%
CI, 1.9%-4.2%; P = .46). In as-treated analyses, which
removed patients who left the network or who died during
follow-up, and who were unable to be reached by the patient
navigator during follow-up, the differences between inter-
vention and control groups increased. With all cancers com-
bined, patients in the intervention group had a mean cancer
screening rate 5.9% (95% CI, 3.6%-7.9%) higher compared
with those in the control group, while it was 7.1% (95% CI,
3.1%-11.2%) higher for breast, 7.9% (95% CI, 3.6%-12.1%)
higher for cervical, and 5.0% (95% CI, 2.4%-7.7%) higher for
colorectal (P < .001 for all comparisons).
The secondary analyses included the proportion of over-
due patients who completed any type of screening during fol-
low-up in intention-to-treat analyses, and was higher in the
intervention group compared with the control group (25.5%
vs 17.0%; 95% CI [for the difference], 4.7%-12.7%; P < .001) as
shown in Figure 2A. In addition, the intervention group had
morepatientscompletingscreeningforbreast(23.4%vs16.6%;
95% CI, 1.8%-12.0%; P = .009), cervical (14.4% vs 8.6%; 95%
CI, 1.6%-10.5%; P = .007), and colorectal (13.7% vs 7.0%; 95%
CI, 3.2%-10.4%; P < .001) cancer in intention-to-treat analy-
ses (Figure 2A). After excluding patients who left the network
orwhodiedduringfollow-up,orwhowereunabletobereached
by the patient navigator during follow-up, the differences be-
tween the intervention and control groups were greater. In
these as-treated analyses, 32.9% of intervention patients com-
pleted any type of screening during follow-up compared with
18.1% in the control group (difference: 14.8%; 95% CI, 10.3%-
19.4%; P < .001). More patients completed breast (29.6% vs
17.6%; 95% CI, 6.2%-17.8%; P < .001), cervical (18.0% vs 9.3%;
95% CI, 3.3%-13.7%; P = .001), and colorectal (18.1% vs 7.6%;
95% CI, 6.3%-14.9%; P < .001) cancer screening in the inter-
vention compared with the control group in as-treated analy-
ses (Figure 2B).

Similar to previous studies,3-5,7-10 the current study shows
that PN significantly improves cancer screening rates in high-
risk patients. However, most of these cancer prevention PN
studies3-5,7-10 have focused on only 1 single cancer screening.
We used a personalized, patient-centered approach to ad-
dress all overdue tests.25 Each navigator had their own group
of patients whom they navigated to obtain screening for all eli-
gible and overdue screening tests.
Patient navigation has been shown to improve cancer care
in high-risk populations; however, recent randomized clini-
cal studies highlight that not all high-risk patients need navi-
gation. The greatest benefits were seen in those at high risk of
being lost to follow-up.28 Patients with more barriers were less
likelytobenefitfromPN.29Identifyingpatientswhocouldmost
benefit from PN is of great importance when implementing PN
programs from a cost-effectiveness perspective. In our pri-
mary care network, almost 14 000 patients were overdue for
at least 1 cancer screening. We developed an algorithm that en-
abled us to choose about 11% of patients at high-risk for non-
adherence with screening. In our randomized clinical trial, we
showed that these patients were unlikely to get screened with-
out PN. Future studies should explore the cost-effectiveness
and patient satisfaction with personalized patient-centered
cancer screening PN programs.

enabled us to use an automated algorithm to select patients at

care in any network affiliated primary care practice. The navi-
gatorsusedthesystemtotrackandnavigatepatientsinrealtime.
Although they were centrally located (in the health center ex-
cludedfromthestudy),theywereabletonavigatepatientsacross
all 18 practices. An additional benefit of using the population
health management system was that overdue screening tests
werescheduledandcompletedwithoutaclinicvisitorclinician
involvement (unless a cervical cancer test was done in the pri-
marycarephysiciansâ€™office).Usingapopulationmanagement,
stepped-care approach, the PNs were able to focus on the most
high-riskpatientsinournetwork;thosewhohadnotcompleted
screening,throughpriorvisit-basedandpopulation-basedefforts.
Limitations of this study include generalizing results to
other settings because it was performed in a single academic
primary care network with established PN and an advanced
IT system. For CRC screening, our network emphasizes colo-
noscopy, and our results did not include completed home fe-
cal stool tests. The 8-month study period does not exclude the
possibility that patients in the control group would have com-
pleted tests if followed for a longer time. The automated risk
algorithmselectedpatientsathighriskfornonadherence;how-
ever, patient navigators were not able to reach 19% of pa-
tients randomized to the intervention group. In addition, 38%
of these patients had competing comorbidities, obtained
screening elsewhere, or declined screenings. Despite the pa-
tient navigators being unable to work with a large proportion
of intervention patients, our intention-to-treat results showed
significantly higher screening rates for each cancer in pa-
tients in the PN group. Efforts to improve the risk algorithm
by identifying patients most likely to report barriers to cancer
care in need of PN,30 or implement a system for providers to
directly refer patients to a PN, may further improve the effec-
tiveness of the program.
Conclusions
Patient navigation, using a visit-independent population man-
agement system, significantly improved comprehensive can-
cer screening among patients at high risk of screening nonad-
herence in a primary care network. Future work should focus
on improving the efficiency of patient navigators through bet-
ter identification of high-risk patients unlikely to undergo
screening through routine measures and with barriers that are
amenable to PN. Using patient navigators who are integrated
into population health management activities for patients at
high risk for screening nonadherence within a practice net-
work may improve equity of cancer care.

In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Percac-Lima et al4
report the findings of a randomized trial of using patient navi-
gators to improve adherence to cancer screening for individu-
alswhoareathighriskofnotbeingscreened.Thetrialwascon-
ducted in 18 primary care practices, each of which is part of the

ploys patient navigators who aid patients with cancer, and pre-
sumably, those with other chronic conditions.
The investigators used a scoring system to identify indi-
viduals at high risk of noncompletion of cancer screening tests
based on history of nonadherence to cancer screening tests,

1626patientsmeetingthisscoringthresholdandeligibletopar-
ticipate, 797 were randomly assigned to receive patient navi-
gation provided by 1 of 4 navigators, college graduates with
appropriate training, and the remaining 829 were assigned to
usual care, which included population management with re-
minder letters. The primary outcome was the cancer screen-
ing test completion rate over the follow-up period for each eli-
gible patient for all cancers combined. Secondary outcomes
included assessing the proportion of patients completing any
and each cancer screening test. The investigators also mea-
sured percent increase in individuals being up-to-date with
screening, and increases in cancer screening rates for any 1 or
all of the target tests. Analysis was conducted both according
