BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Suicide in elementary school–aged children is not well studied, 
despite a recent increase in the suicide rate among US black children. The objectives of 
this study were to describe characteristics and precipitating circumstances of suicide 
in elementary school–aged children relative to early adolescent decedents and identify 
potential within-group racial differences.
METHODS: We analyzed National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) surveillance data 
capturing suicide deaths from 2003 to 2012 for 17 US states. Participants included all 
suicide decedents aged 5 to 14 years (N = 693). Age group comparisons (5–11 years and 
12–14 years) were conducted by using the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.
RESULTS: Compared with early adolescents who died by suicide, children who died by suicide 
were more commonly male, black, died by hanging/strangulation/suffocation, and died at 
home. Children who died by suicide more often experienced relationship problems with 
family members/friends (60.3% vs 46.0%; P = .02) and less often experienced boyfriend/
girlfriend problems (0% vs 16.0%; P < .001) or left a suicide note (7.7% vs 30.2%; P < 
.001). Among suicide decedents with known mental health problems (n = 210), childhood 
decedents more often experienced attention-deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity 
(59.3% vs 29.0%; P = .002) and less often experienced depression/dysthymia (33.3% vs 
65.6%; P = .001) compared with early adolescent decedents.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings raise questions about impulsive responding to psychosocial 
adversity in younger suicide decedents, and they suggest a need for both common and 
developmentally-specific suicide prevention strategies during the elementary school–aged 
and early adolescent years. Further research should investigate factors associated with the 
recent increase in suicide rates among black children.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Suicide is a 
leading cause of death in US elementary school–
aged children, and the suicide rate in black 
school-aged children has increased in recent 
years. However, little is known about the factors 
precipitating suicide in this age group.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study found 
both differences and similarities in individual 
characteristics and precipitating circumstances 
among children and early adolescents who died by 
suicide. Findings support a need for both common 
and developmentally-specifi
 c suicide prevention 
strategies.

Suicide in elementary school–aged 
children is rare. The most recent 
national mortality statistics from 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention reveal a suicide rate of 
0.17 per 100 000 persons in youth 
between the ages of 5 and 11 years, 
in contrast to a rate of 5.18 per 
100 000 among adolescents aged 12 
to 17 years. 
1 Nevertheless, suicide 
ranked 10th as a cause of death for 
US elementary school–aged children 
in 2014. 
2 While our understanding of 
suicide in children remains limited, 
a recent analysis of suicide trends 
in US children (ages 5–11 years 
between 1993–1997 and 2008–
2012) found a significant increase 
in the suicide rate among black 
children and a significant decrease 
for white children. 
3 Given consistent 
observations that suicide rates for 
adolescents and young adults are 
higher in white subjects than in black 
subjects, 
 
1, 
4 
 
 
– 
8 this report of a higher 
rate of suicide in elementary school–
aged black children raises questions 
about whether there are important 
racial and developmental differences 
in the underpinnings of suicide 
between elementary school–aged 
children and older youth. 
Research on precipitating 
circumstances of suicide in young 
people derives primarily from 
studies of adolescents or combined 
adolescent and young adult 
samples. 
6, 
 
9 
 
 
 
 
– 
16 The few studies that 
have included elementary school–
aged suicide decedents are limited 
by small sample sizes in this 
age range.9, 
 
13, 
 
17 
 
–20 One recent 
study examined precipitating 
circumstances in a larger sample 
of youth suicide decedents aged 
10 to 17 years, as reported in the 
National Violent Death Reporting 
System (NVDRS) between 2005 and 
2008 
5; however, children aged 5 to 
9 years were not included, and no 
comparisons according to age group 
were presented.
Previous studies have examined 
characteristics of suicide in “older” 
and “younger” adolescents.

21 
Although the classification into 
older and younger age categories 
has differed across studies (eg, <15 
or 16 years depending on study 
definition versus ≥15 or 16 years), 
age group differences for individual 
characteristics and precipitating 
circumstances associated with 
adolescent suicide have been 
found. 
6, 
13, 
 
17 
 
– 
20 These factors include 
lower rates of psychopathology, 
6, 
 
13, 
 
21 
lower suicidal intent, 
 
6, 
 
9, 
12, 
 
19, 
 
21 and 
less cognitive ability to plan and 
execute a fatal suicide attempt, 
 
6, 
 
12 
suggesting that although suicide rates 
are lower in younger adolescents 
compared with older adolescents, 
impulsive responding may play a 
more prominent role in suicide for 
the younger population.4, 
 
7 Because 
the biological, cognitive, and social 
characteristics of elementary 
school–aged children are evolving 
and continue to develop in 
adolescence, 
 
22 
 
 
– 
27 the individual 
characteristics and circumstances 
found to precede suicide in 
adolescents may not fully generalize 
to elementary school–aged children.
The current study compares 
individual characteristics and 
precipitating circumstances of 
suicide in elementary school–aged 
children to those of early adolescent 
suicide decedents and describes 
potential racial differences within age 
groups by using data obtained from 
the NVDRS. Improved understanding 
of factors precipitating suicide in 
elementary school–aged children 
could help frame future prevention 
efforts targeting this population.
METHODS
The NVDRS is a state-based 
surveillance system that collects data 
on all violent deaths; it has multiple 
sources, including medical examiners, 
coroners, law enforcement, crime 
laboratories, and death certificates. 
28 
We obtained data between 2003 
and 2012 from the NVDRS on all 
youth aged 5 to 14 years whose 
manner of death was suicide. Suicide 
is defined in the NVDRS as a death 
resulting from the use of force 
against oneself when a collection of 
evidence indicates that the use of 
force was intentional. 
29 Precipitating 
circumstances of suicide collected 
in the NVDRS relate to mental 
health history and treatment status, 
substance use and abuse, physical 
health history, relationship problems, 
school problems, legal problems, 
other stressful life events (eg, victim 
of interpersonal violence), and 
suicide-related circumstances (eg, 
disclosed intent to die by suicide, 
history of suicide attempts). Given 
developmental considerations of 
very young children, suicide is never 
coded as a cause of death for children 
≤4 years. 
1 Therefore, the lower age 
limit in this study was 5 years; the 
upper age limit of 14 years marks the 
end of early adolescence. 
30 Thirty-
two states currently participate in the 
NVDRS. However, restricted-use data 
were only available from 17 states: 
Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, 
and Virginia (2003–2012); Colorado, 
Georgia, Oklahoma, North Carolina, 
Rhode Island, and Wisconsin (2004–
2012); Kentucky, New Mexico, and 
Utah (2005–2012); and Ohio (2010–
2012). This study was considered 
exempt according to the review 
policy of The Research Institute 
at Nationwide Children’s Hospital 
Institutional Review Board.
Comparisons were made on the basis 
of age group (5–11 years and 12–14 
years) and race (black and non-black) 
within age strata. The non-black 
group represented all other races 
because the numbers were too small 
to allow for meaningful comparisons 
across specific racial subgroups. 
Other comparison variables 
included the following: demographic 
characteristics, time/place of injury, 
suicide method, precipitating 
circumstances (eg, recent life 
stressors), toxicology findings,

mental health diagnoses, alcohol/
other substance abuse problems, and 
history of mental health treatment.
Categorical data were compared 
between the groups by using the χ2 
statistic or, when a zero cell or any 
cell with an expected value <5 was 
present, Fisher’s exact test. Statistical 
significance was set at P < .05. All 
statistical analyses were performed 
with SPSS version 21 (IBM SPSS 
Statistics, IBM Corporation, 
Armonk, NY).
RESULTS
There were 699 suicides for youth 
aged 5 to14 years identified in the 
NVDRS during the study period. The 
underlying cause of death for 62 
incidents was either missing (n = 41) 
or not coded as suicide based on the 
International Statistical Classification 
of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, Tenth Revision (X60-X84, 
Y87.0, and U03; n = 21). 
1 These 62 
incidents were reviewed by 2 authors 
(A.H.S., J.A.B.); 6 cases were found to 
be misclassified as suicide and were 
excluded, leaving 693 cases of suicide 
(87 children [aged 5–11 years] and 
606 early adolescents [aged 12–14 
years]) for analysis.
Relative to early adolescents who 
died by suicide, children who died 
by suicide were more commonly 
male, black, died by hanging/
strangulation/suffocation, died at 
home, and experienced relationship 
problems with family members 
and friends ( 
Table 1). Childhood 
decedents were also less likely to 
leave a suicide note, be depressed, 
or experience boyfriend/girlfriend 
problems compared with early 
adolescents who died by suicide 
( 
Tables 1 and  
2). An identical 
percentage of childhood and early 
adolescent decedents (29%) 
disclosed suicide intent to another 
person before death.
Although a current mental 
health problem was observed in 
approximately one-third of all suicide 
decedents in the sample, there were 
no age group differences in rates of 
current mental health problems or 
mental health treatment ( 
Table 2). 
Among decedents with a current 
mental health problem, a diagnosis of 
attention-deficit disorder/attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADD/ADHD) was more common 
in children who died by suicide 
compared with early adolescents 
who died by suicide (59.3% 
vs 29.0%; P = .0002), whereas 
depression/dysthymia was more 
common among early adolescents 
who died by suicide compared with 
children who died by suicide (65.6% 
vs 33.3%; P = .0001).
Rates of alcohol or substance abuse 
problems and the presence of alcohol 
or illicit drugs at the time of death 
were generally low and did not 
differ significantly between groups. 
However, 3.9% and 7.5% of children 
and early adolescents, respectively, 
who died by suicide tested positive 
for opiates, rates higher than alcohol 
and other substances.
When stratified according to age 
group ( 
Table 3), black children who 
died by suicide were more likely 
to die by hanging/strangulation/
suffocation compared to non-black 
children. For early adolescents who 
died by suicide, black adolescents 
were also more likely to die by 
hanging/strangulation/suffocation 
but had lower rates of boyfriend/
girlfriend problems, and they 
were less likely to leave a suicide 
note compared to non-black early 
adolescents who died by suicide.
DISCUSSION
This multistate study of elementary 
school–aged children and early 
adolescents who died by suicide 
suggests that some individual 
characteristics and precipitating 
circumstances may be more 
prominent in children who died by 
suicide relative to young adolescent 
suicide decedents. Consistent with 
previous research, 
 
4 
 
– 
7, 
9, 
 
12, 
 
13, 
 
19 most 
suicide deaths in both age groups 
occurred in male subjects and at 
the decedent’s residence. Notably, 
when comparing the individual 
characteristics and circumstances 
of childhood and early adolescent 
suicide decedents, children who 
died by suicide were more likely 
to be male, black, die by hanging/
strangulation/suffocation, have 
problems with family or friends, and 
were less likely to leave a suicide 
note and exhibit depressed mood. 
Among study decedents with known 
mental health problems, children 
who died by suicide had higher rates 
of ADD/ADHD than early adolescent 
decedents, suggesting that they 
may have been more vulnerable 
as a group to respond impulsively 
to interpersonal challenges. In 
contrast, higher rates of depression 
were found in early adolescents 
who died by suicide compared with 
children who died by suicide. This 
finding is consistent with earlier 
research demonstrating depressive 
psychopathology to be more common 
in older versus younger adolescent 
suicide decedents. 
6, 
9, 
 
20, 
 
21 Although 
the use of alcohol or illicit drugs 
before death was relatively rare in 
both age groups, our finding that 
3.9% and 7.5% of child and early 
adolescent decedents, respectively, 
tested positive for opiates was 
nevertheless surprising, troubling, 
and worthy of attention.
Relationship problems (eg, 
arguments) were the most common 
precipitating circumstance observed 
in both childhood and early 
adolescent decedents, but the specific 
types of relationship problems 
differed along developmental lines. 
Compared to early adolescents who 
died by suicide, children who died 
by suicide were more likely to have 
relationship problems with family 
members and friends, whereas 
boyfriend/girlfriend problems were 
specific to early adolescents who

SHEFTALL et al 
died by suicide. These differences are 
not surprising given that elementary 
school–aged children are more likely 
to spend time with family and friends 
and less likely to engage in romantic 
relationships, which become more 
common in early adolescence. 
21, 
 
24 
 
–27
The current study found that 36.8% 
of elementary school–aged suicide 
decedents were black compared with 
11.6% of early adolescent decedents. 
These results are in keeping with 
our previous report that 36.1% of all 
suicide deaths in 5- to 11-year-olds 
between 2003 and 2012 occurred in 
black children, nearly double the rate 
reported in the same demographic 
group between 1993 and 2002 
(18.6%). 
3 We were especially 
interested in examining potential 
racial differences in precipitating 
circumstances given that black youth 
may experience disproportionate 
exposure to violence or traumatic 
stressors, 
 
31 
– 
33 both of which have 
been associated with suicidal 
behavior.4 Also, research has shown 
that black youth are less likely to 
receive services for depression, 
suicidal ideation, and other mental 
health problems compared with 
non-black youth.

racial disparities in precipitating 
circumstances within age group were 
examined in the current study, few 
differences were found. Suicide by 
hanging/strangulation/suffocation 
was more common among black 
decedents in both age groups, and 
black early adolescents who died by 
suicide were less likely to experience 
boyfriend/girlfriend problems or 
leave a suicide note than non-black 
youth.
Public Health and Clinical 
Implications
Study findings suggest there are both 
commonalities and some differences 
between childhood and early 
adolescent suicide decedents with 
regard to individual characteristics 
and precipitating factors. The finding 
that circumstances precipitating 
suicide appear to be similar for black 
and non-black elementary school–
aged children suggests that universal 
suicide prevention and treatment 
strategies may be appropriate. 
However, more research is needed 
to establish whether unique patterns 
of suicide risk exist to suggest that 
prevention efforts might incorporate 
diverse strategies informed by 
developmental level, race, or 
ethnicity.
Taken together with previous studies, 
there appears to be justification for 
future research examining whether 
a developmental progression of 
vulnerability to suicide exists that 
is more prominently influenced by 
impulsive responding in younger 
children and by depressed mood 
and emotional distress with 
increasing age into adolescence and 
young adulthood. This is not to say 
that impulsivity is not a relevant 
vulnerability to suicide across the life 
span, but rather raises the question

as to whether impulsive responding 
may be a more relevant vulnerability 
to suicide in childhood compared 
with adolescence, where it remains a 
marker of risk. 
4, 
 
7, 
 
35, 
 
36 Such research 
could have important implications 
for suicide prevention efforts in 
childhood and potentially diminish 
the relevance of traditional strategies 
focused primarily on identifying and 
treating depression as a means of 
mitigating suicide risk. Relatedly, 
ADD/ADHD was the most common 
known mental health disorder in 
children who died by suicide, raising 
questions as to whether specific 
suicide prevention approaches might 
be productively applied to that 
diagnostic population.
Because interpersonal problems 
were found to be a precipitating 
factor in both child and early 
adolescent suicide, targeting 
interpersonal problem-solving 
skill development and building 
positive emotional and interpersonal 
skills early in childhood may be 
2 upstream suicide prevention 
approaches with strong potential to 
reduce youth suicide rates. 
37 
– 
39 One 
intervention program that has been 
successful in improving emotional 
and interpersonal skills in school-
aged children is the Promoting 
Alternative Thinking Strategies 
program (PATHS). 
40 The PATHS 
curriculum provides instruction in 
topics concerning the expression, 
understanding, and regulation of 
emotions. Children in the PATHS 
program learn to discuss their 
emotions by using a larger array 
of words increasing their emotion 
vocabulary and increase their 
emotional meta-cognitive skills 
allowing them to better understand 
emotional cues expressed by 
others.40
Another promising strategy for 
communities to consider is the 
Good Behavior Game, an elementary 
school–based behavior management 
intervention that teaches children 
how to cooperate with each other, 
self-regulate, and maintain self-
control to work toward valued 
goals. 
41 The Good Behavior Game has 
demonstrated significant reductions 
in impulsive and inattentive 
behaviors, 
 
42 as well as long-term 
effectiveness in reducing risk of 
suicide attempts in adolescents and 
young adults who participated in the 
program in first and second grades. 
43
Finally, suicide intent was disclosed 
to another person before death 
with time for intervention in 
29% of all suicide decedents. This 
percentage did not differ between 
the age groups and was similar to 
what was reported in the previous 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention study that examined 
precipitating circumstances in youth 
suicide decedents (29.2%). 
5 This 
finding highlights the importance 
of educating pediatricians, primary 
health care providers, families, 
school personnel, and peers about 
how to recognize and respond to the 
warning signs of suicide and to treat 
all disclosures of suicidal thoughts 
and behaviors seriously. 
7, 
 
38, 
 
44, 
45 
Parents or trusted adults proactively 
asking youth directly about suicidal 
thoughts may invoke important 
conversations that most likely will 
not be initiated by children and early 
adolescents.
Pediatric primary care is an ideal 
venue for physicians and nurses to 
ask youth directly about suicidal 
thoughts and behaviors. 
45 
 
– 
48 More 
than 80% of youth visit their 
primary care provider at least once 
annually, and a similar percentage 
of youth who die by suicide were 
examined by a health care provider 
in the year before their death.49 
– 
51 
Nevertheless, youth will most likely 
present with somatic complaints and 
if not asked directly about suicidal 
thoughts may not speak of them. 
47 
Use of suicide risk–screening tools 
by pediatricians have been found to 
be associated with a 4-fold increase 
in detection of suicidal risk in youth, 
while not overburdening the clinical 
workflow and amounting to 1 extra 
mental health referral per week. 
52 
Implementing universal screening 
in primary care settings could help 
capture youth at risk and increase 
the likelihood of youth receiving 
mental health services to decrease 
the probability of engaging in future 
suicidal behavior. Screening also 
affords pediatricians the opportunity 
to alert parents to potential risks and 
discuss important warning signs.
One program that has shown 
to be effective in reducing self-
reported suicidal behavior in both 
middle and high school children 
is the Signs of Suicide prevention 
program. 
53 
– 
55 This program raises 
awareness that suicide is a risk 
for some mental health disorders, 
especially depression, and teaches 
one how to recognize and act when 
someone is displaying warning 
signs related to suicidal thoughts 
and behaviors. Another program 
recently established by the American 
Foundation for Suicide Prevention 
is the Signs Matter: Early Detection 
program. 
56 This online program 
educates teachers and school 
staff members from kindergarten 
through 12th grade on the signs 
associated with suicide risk, the 
typical behaviors presented in a 
school setting for students struggling 
with mental health problems, 
and the necessary steps to take if 
signs are detected.56 This program 
is promising and awaits further 
evaluation of its effectiveness.
Limitations
There are several potential limitations 
of the present study. First, restricted-
use data from the NVDRS were 
only available for 17 US states and, 
therefore, findings are not nationally 
representative. From 2003 to 2012, 
approximately one-third of all suicide 
deaths in 5- to 14-year-olds in the 
United States occurred in these 17 
participating states. 
1 Second, data 
about the precipitating circumstances 
associated with the suicide were 
7

Downloaded from 
  
SHEFTALL et al 
unknown for ∼13% of decedents, and 
testing for the presence of alcohol 
and drugs was not performed on all 
decedents. Third, no corrections were 
made for the multiple comparisons 
between the age groups, and the lack 
of significant within-group effects 
may be due to inadequate statistical 
power, given that our findings are 
based on a relatively small number 
of elementary school–aged suicide 
decedents. Fourth, although this 
study included a comparison group 
of early adolescents, the analyses are 
uncontrolled, and future research is 
needed to establish whether certain 
circumstances and diagnoses are 
causal risk factors. For example, 
although the rate of depression 
was found to be higher in early 
adolescents than in children who died 
by suicide, it may be that the rate of 
depression in a prepubertal control 
group would be even lower and thus 
would still be a risk factor for suicide 
in elementary school–aged children. 
Finally, the study was limited to an 
analysis of quantitative data elements. 
The NVDRS also collects detailed 
incident narratives from coroner/
medical examiner reports and law 
enforcement reports. A qualitative 
analysis of NVDRS narrative data 
are currently underway by our 
research group in an effort to better 
understand the personal, familial, and 
social factors that may contribute to 
suicide in young people.
CONCLUSIONS
Using NVDRS data, we describe 
both similarities and differences in 
characteristics and precipitating 
circumstances of suicide in 
elementary school–aged children 
versus early adolescents, suggesting 
that both common and differential 
suicide prevention strategies may 
be applicable during these distinct 
developmental periods. Important 
next steps will be to investigate 
potential factors (eg, mental health, 
cultural, environmental) that may 
have contributed to the recent 
increase in suicide rates among black 
elementary school–aged children 
3 
and identify overall and race-specific 
predictors of suicide in children 
younger than 12 years.
