We are in the midst of a digital revolution in health care, although the application of new and useful technology in routine clinical practice
is variable. The Characterizing Atrial fibrillation by Translating its Causes into Health Modifiers in the Elderly (CATCH ME) Consortium,
in collaboration with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), has funded the creation of two applications (apps) in atrial fibrillation
(AF) for use in smartphones and tablets. The patient app aims to enhance patient education, improve communication between patients
and health care professionals, and encourage active patient involvement in the management of their condition. The health care profes-
sional app is designed as an interactive management tool incorporating the new ESC Practice Guidelines on AF and supported by the
European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), with the aim of improving best practice approaches for the care of patients with AF. Both
stand-alone apps are now freely available for Android and iOS devices though the Google Play, Amazon, and Apple stores. In this article,
we outline the rationale for the design and implementation of these apps. Our objective is to demonstrate the value of integrating novel
digital technology into clinical practice, with the potential for patient engagement, optimization of pharmacological and interventional ther-
apy in AF, and ultimately to improve patient outcomes.

Introduction
Smartphones, tablet computers, and their applications (apps) have
become ubiquitous in modern life all across the world. In Europe and
North America, approximately two-thirds of the population own
mobile devices, with year-on-year increases. Their role in our lives
has continually changed, and for many people, smartphones and tab-
lets are the primary method for communication and accessing online

 information. Although lagging behind social networking, the popular-
ity of interactive health communication applications is growing, not
only to provide health information but also to combine education
with the goal of behaviour change.1 Better patient understanding has
the potential to improve health outcomes.2 In patients with heart dis-
ease, education allows better appreciation of individual risk and facili-
tates commencement of and compliance with treatment.3 The use of
computer or web-based patient tools appears to have positive effects
across a range of outcomes, including patient knowledge, behaviour,
and even clinical outcomes (e.g. improved diabetic control or less dis-
ability from asthma).4 On the other side of the consultation, there
are many medical apps available to assist doctors, although few, to-
date, have been specifically written by and for clinicians.5
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder
and poses a considerable burden to health care services, with rising
incidence and prevalence, and high rates of morbidity and mortality.6
Aside from the prognostic benefit of oral anticoagulation therapy and
management of cardiovascular risk, treatment of AF is targeted to-
wards the relief of symptoms, including the control of heart rate and
rhythm.7 Adherence to long-term therapy is of particular importance,
supported by a multidisciplinary team that includes primary care
practitioners, cardiologists, electrophysiologists, stroke physicians, al-
lied health professionals, and support staff. Management of AF is
therefore uniquely suited to a process of shared decision-making,8 to
support the patients’ understanding of the disease and available thera-
pies.9 Patient education can improve anticoagulation control in AF
patients,10 and integrated AF management is a cost-effective means
of reducing unnecessary hospital admissions and adverse clinical out-
comes.11,12 From the perspective of health care professionals, adher-
ence to clinical practice guidelines have been shown to improve
prognosis in patients with AF.13–15
In concert with the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
Guidelines on AF,7 we are launching mobile applications for patients
with AF and their health care professionals (Figure 1). The patient app
aims to enhance patient education, optimize communication be-
tween patients and health care providers, increase patient involve-
ment in management decisions, and encourage self-management
activities. The health care professional app is designed to interactively
apply the new ESC AF Guidelines to individual patients, facilitating
the adoption of best practice management of AF, with the aim of im-
proving patient outcomes.
Rationale
The patient and health care professional apps for AF were developed
to disseminate the new 2016 ESC AF Guidelines through different
formats to reach a wide and expanding audience. Our approach had
three main foundations that are discussed in detail below:
(i) Apps in other health care settings have had a positive impact on
patient behaviour and clinical outcomes; (ii) digital learning in the con-
text of educational theory affords a new pathway of providing sup-
portive patient education; and (iii) education of health care
professionals and encouraging guideline-adherent care can contrib-
ute to enhanced professional standards and improved management
of patients with AF.
Evidence from other health care apps
The impact of health-related apps have been studied in numerous
randomized controlled trials. During our design phase, we performed
a keyword search of PubMed and Google Scholar to identify apps
with published health outcomes (April 2016; search terms apps/mo-
bile and randomized) and summarize some key trials here. An app
providing cognitive behavioural therapy skills demonstrated reduced
symptoms of depression and less work absence compared with those
randomized to website support (n = 300).16 In 597 adults with back
pain, a mobile app successfully encouraged self-management skills,
leading to a reduction in back pain at 4 months.17 A web-based app
on healthy lifestyle interventions had a positive impact on physical ac-
tivity over 14 weeks in 56 participants compared with 29 controls
(63 ± 21 min vs. -30± 28min; P = 0.02), leading to more weight loss
and higher success in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The frequency of
app use was significantly related to a higher success score.18 Short-
term benefits over an 8-week period were also seen with an app that
encouraged physical activity using social networking (n = 110).19 In
patients at risk of diabetes, a combined mobile app and pedometer
increased physical activity, reduced blood pressure, and improved
dietary intake in 30 patients compared with 31 controls.20 However,
in another randomized trial, a mobile phone app was unable to elicit
any improvement in physical activity at 8 weeks (n = 51).21 An app de-
signed to improve adherence to medications in elderly patients led to
fewer missed doses compared with the controls (n = 48 and 51, re-
spectively), and 88% of those using the app felt more independent in
managing their therapy.22
The studies discussed earlier have important limitations, including
highly motivated and selected populations, and only short-term
evaluation. A systematic review of mobile health interventions sug-
gests a benefit from various types of intervention but also a clear
need for further robust evidence.23
Context of educational theory
Learning theories have progressed from purely behaviourist (passive
learning in response to external stimuli; e.g. Pavlov’s conditioning),
through cognitivist learning (internalization of knowledge), and more
recently constructivist models (learning through the experience of
knowledge).24,25 These theories have formed the basis for optimal
teaching methods during the last century26; however, the availability
of new technology has the potential to embed digital-aided learning
within routine clinical practice.27 Although access to information and
technology systems has increased exponentially, the corresponding
What’s new?
• The 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines
on atrial fibrillation (AF) recommend patient-centred care and
an integrated, multidisciplinary treatment approach.
• Smartphone and tablet apps can provide education, encourage
behaviour change, and increase treatment adherence in patients
as well as deliver interactive treatment algorithms to aid clinicians.
• The patient app aims to enhance patient education on AF, self-
management, and shared decision-making.
• The health care professional app is designed around the 2016
ESC Guidelines on AF to simplify the choice of treatment and
optimize guideline adherence.

 levels of use within education remains modest.28 There are also im-
portant limitations that can impede digital learning, such as language,
culture, and baseline knowledge, as well as app functionality and read-
ability.29–31
So what are the theoretical implications for app development to
assist patients with AF? Figure 2 adapts Salmon’s five-stage model of
online learning32 to illustrate the key points of a structured develop-
mental process. These can lead to patient enablement (provision of
appropriate context for new knowledge and skills)33 and, hence, sup-
ported and successful learning (as described by Vygotsky’s Zone of
Development).34 Reflecting on the learning classification described
by Bloom,35 users start to understand new concepts and apply know-
ledge to their own circumstances. One of the aims of our app is to
allow independent patient evaluation of treatment options, enabling
an informed choice and partnership-in-care between patients and
their health care providers. Such a model has the potential to encour-
age satisfaction with treatment, increase self-management, reduce
cost, and improve patient well-being.
Context of professional standards
Physician education
Professional standards frameworks across Europe highlight the im-
portance of ongoing education. In this context, mobile applications
are an important part of integrating and internalizing knowledge as
well as transmitting this learning to others.36–39 The general direction
of technology suggests that mobile applications will become an in-
creasingly important method to improve and maintain professional
standards in health care.40
Physician interaction with patients
The active participation of patients in health care consultations and
development of patient autonomy is a principle common to profes-
sional standards across the world.41 This includes the Physician
Charter,42 adopted by the European Federation of Internal Medicine,
the American Board of Internal Medicine, and the American College
of Physicians, as well as standards of the UK General Medical
Council.39 The CanMEDS code of the Royal College of Physicians
and Surgeons of Canada puts a responsibility on physicians to facili-
tate patient learning, not only by educating patients but also by
promoting health literacy for the purposes of ‘establishing rapport
and trust, formulating a diagnosis, delivering information, striving for
mutual understanding, and facilitating a shared plan of care’.43
Similarly, the Core Curriculum for General Cardiologists of the ESC
and the Core Curriculum for Nurses of the ESC Council for
Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions recognize the import-
ance of patient education in all areas of cardiac care.44,45
Design
App design was led by a core group (see Supplementary material
online,
Appendix 1)
comprising of representatives from the
Characterizing Atrial fibrillation by Translating its Causes into Health
Modifiers in the Elderly (CATCH ME) Consortium, the ESC
Guidelines Task Force on AF, and the European Heart Rhythm
Association (EHRA). Bo
¨rm Bruckmeier Publishing (Germany) was
commissioned to produce the apps. The main components and ob-
jectives of the app development programme are displayed in Figure 3.
In brief, we developed the apps in tandem with the writing of the
2016 ESC Guidelines on AF while maintaining the confidentiality of
the guidelines. The Task Force writing the guidelines were instrumen-
tal in defining the content of the apps. The guideline flowcharts for
different sections of AF management determined the design of the
apps. This process began in October 2014, an outline of the app func-
tionalities was completed in October 2015, and the final guideline
structure was incorporated into the Apps Software Requirements
Specification by February 2016. Model View Presenter Framework
(Android) and Model View Controller (iOS) were used, with the
overall product based on Client Server Architecture. The apps were
publicly released at the ESC Congress in Barcelona (August 2017).
As the Healthcare Professional app determines patient treatment, a
CE (Conformite
´ Europe
´ene) certification application has been sub-
mitted to conform with European Commission Directives (Class IIa
medical device).
Patient app
The patient app provides education on AF, including sections describ-
ing the pathology, symptoms, prognosis, associated comorbidities,
management strategies, and practical tips for self-care (Figure 4A).
Information was derived from existing patient documentation de-
veloped by the British Heart Foundation (https://www.bhf.org.uk/),
the German National Network of Competence in Atrial Fibrillation
(AFNET; http://www.kompetenznetz-vorhofflimmern.de/), and a pa-
tient booklet on AF developed in the Netherlands.46 The text was
then edited by a team of patient representatives with AF (funded
through a UK National Institute of Health Research grant on improv-
ing patient outcomes in AF).47 The patient app will also present infor-
mation on individual stroke risk and provide a personal health record
and symptom diary. Patients are asked to fill in sections about rele-
vant previous health issues, which can facilitate consultation when
shared with their health care professional(s).
Healthcare Professional app
The Healthcare Professional app is a more complex tool, allowing
both conventional viewing of guideline text and recommendations
and interactive treatment algorithms (Figure 4B). The app is also

 designed to improve consultation efficiency, with the provision of a
patient register, pre-filled with data supplied by the patient. A tablet
version of the app will also be available, allowing overview of multiple
patients (e.g. in an outpatient clinic setting). Users are able to launch
the AF Treatment Manager directly through the existing ESC Pocket
Guidelines app, also available free of charge for iOS and Android de-
vices through their respective stores.
Patient to doctor communication,
security, and privacy
A key feature of the apps is communication between consenting pa-
tients and their health care professional(s). Patients will be able to se-
curely share their data through a cloud server, permitting health care
professionals to import relevant information into the Healthcare
Professional app (such as symptoms, stroke risk factors, and

Reciprocally, the health care professional can also share collated in-
formation with the patient, in the form of an automated email.
Potential for observational research
For patients who specifically consent to the use of data for research
purposes, anonymized data will be saved for future exploration of
symptomatology, treatment patterns, and guideline adherence. This
is an unparalleled capability, allowing us to collate information on pa-
tients with AF across all communities, including primary practice and
hospital clinics. Understanding the barriers to effective guideline im-
plementation will help to improve future guidelines on AF and make
them more relevant to patient care.
Evaluation
Evaluation of the apps is essential to determine their ability to provide
knowledge to patients and health care professionals and their impact
on guideline adherence. This is an ongoing process, and feedback will
drive the further development of these tools.
The process of initial testing and evaluation was as follows:
(1)
Appraisal by members of the ESC AF Guidelines Task Force to en-
sure that content for both patient and health care apps followed
guideline recommendations.
(2)
In-house testing of individual components by the app development
team, including at least fortnightly confidential teleconferencing up-
dates during the finalization of the 2016 ESC AF Guidelines.
(3)
Initial evaluation was centred around interface design, technology,
and acceptability, using published scales that help evaluate health
care smartphone applications (see Supplementary material online,
Appendix 2).48,49
(4)
Discussions and protocol development for patient data protection,
data storage, and security.
(5)
Patient-facing materials (educational text and images) were de-
signed and reviewed by a patient involvement team and representa-
tives of the British Heart Foundation.
(6)
Testing of each app in entirety by the app development team to
identify programming errors and inconsistencies.
(7)
Confidential testing and design enhancement by the wider ESC AF
Guidelines Task Force, members of the CATCH ME consortium
and EHRA to improve app functionality.
(8)
Beta-testing using self-contained devices within user cohorts to en-
sure acceptable language, ease of use, and clinical utility. The apps
were tested by a group of CATCH ME investigators and junior and
senior clinicians at the CATCH ME clinical centres on three occa-
sions throughout 2016. Further testing regarding content and us-
ability was carried out during the AFNET/EHRA Consensus
Conference (January 2017) by AF clinicians and specialists.
(9)
Updates following beta-testing and finalization of app design. Beta-
testing was performed by 67 persons (iOS and Android, both pa-
tient and health care professional apps), with feedback leading to
new test versions. In total, there were 50 test versions of the apps,
with step-wise iterations leading to better functionality.
Post-publication feedback
As surveying users can often be biased, the apps will include an an-
onymous feedback option for comment on features that work or do
not work well. Although web-based surveys also suffer from sampling
biases, they do allow more self-disclosure50 and are likely to be a
more useful tool for evaluation and subsequent app modification.
Discussion
The development of smartphone and tablet apps for patients and
health care professionals is an exciting opportunity to increase active
patient involvement in the management of their AF, provide educa-
tion to patients and health care professionals, and potentially improve
clinical outcomes through the pursuit of guideline-adherent care.
This approach is well suited to provide structured and integrated
management of AF, as recommended in the 2016 ESC AF
Guidelines.7
As discussed above, there is a good rationale behind the develop-
ment of apps in AF, including evidence from other health care appli-
cations showing improvement in patient management.51 The apps
also provide a new method to support patient empowerment
through education as well as easily accessible ‘on-the-job’ health care
professional training. The ability of the apps to enhance learning is
based on a number of educational theories that offer users not only
knowledge from evidence-based guidelines but also the application
and reinforcement of this information within a digital platform. The
health care professional app also addresses a number of key profes-
sional standards for the development of good clinical practice with
regard to continued professional development and establishing an
integrated, patient-centred approach to care. The long-term manage-
ment of chronic conditions like AF is likely to benefit from informed
and autonomous patients,52,53 potentially leading to better outcomes
through shared decision-making.8,54,55 Although patient information
is now widely available through written and verbal information, there
remains a lack of specific knowledge related to AF.56–58 Currently
available education tools are almost entirely focused on anticoagula-
tion therapy,10,59–61 and although of clear clinical importance, this
may not match what patients want and need to know about AF in
general.62,63 The huge advantage of our app-based tools are the dy-
namic nature of the technology, allowing us to add and modify fea-
tures or information sources in response to user feedback and
reflecting future updates of the ESC AF guidelines.
App-based interventions are a relatively new method of education
in health care; however, there is a large body of evidence for online
learning in the teaching profession. In a systematic review of 99 stud-
ies, face-to-face and online learning methods were examined in a var-
iety of topics for undergraduate and postgraduate learners. Effect
sizes were largest for the combination of face-to-face and online in-
struction compared with either separately, and online working was
more efficient if directed or collaborative rather than independent
student learning.64 To extrapolate to the use of medical apps, this re-
inforces the need for the patient app to be part of the clinical experi-
ence, underpinned by the standard educational approach from health
care professionals. Similarly, the Healthcare Professional app should
be used in the context of ongoing professional development to
achieve improvements in clinical management. New innovations usu-
ally go through a peak and trough of usage (the so-called ‘hype cycle’),
and the design group were therefore keen to ensure that the apps re-
tain relevance and functionality over time by including the means for
continual update and improvement. The rapid rate of change in
230

 technology itself creates a number of issues related to access, ethical
process, and privacy. However, as the general public move towards
greater acceptance (and reliance) on mobile platforms, the medical
community have an opportunity to use these advances to improve
patient care.
Limitations
There are limitations to our approach, most notably that not all pa-
tients and health care professionals will have access to smartphones
or tablets. However, recent data from the USA suggest that even in
adults over the age of 65, internet use is increasing exponentially and
that around 70% now own a mobile phone (although smartphones in
this age group are still less common).65 The main barriers to smart-
phone use in older patients appears to be related to lack of perceived
knowledge around the technology and visual impairment.66 Both of
these issues were considered during the design phase of the apps,
with the use of ‘patient-approved’ education materials, simple func-
tionality, straightforward layout, and readable font size.
Finally, although digital forms of learning are increasing and may pro-
vide benefit,67 there is a tendency to overvalue the use of technology.68
Put simply, we should ensure that the time spent in learning and using a
new resource is time and cost-efficient, with sustained value over any
short-term (or gimmick) objectives. Our aim was to achieve good
productivity of both the patient and health care professional apps, and
for usage to increase over time, while accepting that our initial designs
are likely to need ongoing improvements in response to the changing
requirements of patients with AF and their health care providers.
Conclusions and clinical
perspective
We have outlined the rationale for new smartphone and tablet applica-
tions for patients with AF and their health care professionals, reviewing
the evidence for improving patient outcomes, enhancing professional
standards, and supporting the use of digital learning. Our clinical aim is
to increase patient engagement and guideline adherence with AF man-
agement and, ultimately, improve patient well-being and long-term
prognosis. The apps are freely available for Android and iOS devices.
