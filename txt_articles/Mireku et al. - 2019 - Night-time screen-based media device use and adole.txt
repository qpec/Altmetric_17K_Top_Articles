Objective: The present study investigates the relationship between night-time screen-based media devices
(SBMD) use, which refers to use within 1 h before sleep, in both lit and dark rooms, and sleep outcomes and
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among 11 to 12-year-olds.
Methods: We analysed baseline data from a large cohort of 6616 adolescents from 39 schools in and around
London, United Kingdom, participating in the Study of Cognition Adolescents and Mobile Phone (SCAMP).
Adolescents self-reported their use of any SBMD (mobile phone, tablet, laptop, television etc.). Sleep variables
were derived from self-reported weekday and/or weekend bedtime, sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake time.
Sleep quality was assessed using four standardised dimensions from the Swiss Health Survey. HRQoL was es-
timated using the KIDSCREEN-10 questionnaire.
Results: Over two-thirds (71.5%) of adolescents reported using at least one SBMD at night-time, and about a
third (32.2%) reported using mobile phones at night-time in darkness. Night-time mobile phone and television
use was associated with higher odds of insufficient sleep duration on weekdays (Odds Ratio, OR = 1.82, 95%
Confidence Interval, CI [1.59, 2.07] and OR = 1.40, 95% CI [1.23, 1.60], respectively). Adolescents who used
mobile phones in a room with light were more likely to have insufficient sleep (OR = 1.32, 95% CI [1.10, 1.60])
and later sleep midpoint (OR = 1.64, 95% CI [1.37, 1.95]) on weekends compared to non-users. The magnitude
of these associations was even stronger for those who used mobile phones in darkness for insufficient sleep
duration on weekdays (OR = 2.13, 95% CI [1.79, 2.54]) and for later sleep midpoint on weekdays (OR = 3.88,
95% CI [3.25, 4.62]) compared to non-users. Night-time use of mobile phones was associated with lower HRQoL
and use in a dark room was associated with even lower KIDSCREEN-10 score (β = –1.18, 95% CI [–1.85, –0.52])
compared to no use.
Conclusions: We found consistent associations between night-time SBMD use and poor sleep outcomes and worse
HRQoL in adolescents. The magnitude of these associations was stronger when SBMD use occurred in a dark
room versus a lit room.

 1. Introduction
It is estimated that humans spend a third of their lifetime sleeping or
attempting to do so (Colten et al., 2006). Sufficient sleep duration and
quality are vital, especially for children and adolescents to maintain
their ongoing physical and mental development (Brand and Kirov,
2011). Good sleep hygiene is crucial for cognitive processes, including
sustained attention and memory (Lim and Dinges, 2010). Among ado-
lescents, poor sleep hygiene is associated with poor academic perfor-
mance (Dewald et al., 2010). Indeed, insufficient sleep has also been
shown to be associated with impaired cellular immune responses, de-
pression, anxiety and obesity in children and adolescents (Roberts et al.,
2009; Seegers et al., 2011; Spiegel et al., 2002). The United States
National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recommends a sleep duration of 9 to
11 h for school-aged children (6 to 13-year-old) (Hirshkowitz et al.,
2015).
Despite the importance of sleep in optimal adolescent health and
development, sleep deficits are prevalent in this age group (Gradisar
et al., 2011). An analysis of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance
System data (Basch et al., 2014) revealed that > 90% of high school
students slept less than the recommended 9 h. A recent meta-analysis
investigating global sleep patterns among adolescents also reported that
on average, children are sleeping < 9 h on school-nights and thus in-
stigating attempted catch-up sleep during weekend nights (Gradisar
et al., 2011). A trend towards later bed times and fixed school/workday
wake times has been suggested to explain the 1 h per night reduction in
sleep duration over the past century (Matricciani et al., 2012). In ad-
dition to insufficient sleep duration, other sleep problems such as de-
layed sleep onset, poor sleep quality, and restless sleep are also pre-
valent among adolescents (Fricke-Oerkermann et al., 2007; Hochadel
et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2011).
Although delays in sleep pattern are expected to occur as part of the
physiological effect of pubertal development and resulting changes in
circadian regulation of sleep (Colten et al., 2006), lifestyle influences
from increasing access and use of screen-based media devices (SBMD)
have been shown to contribute heavily to the detrimental sleep hygiene
of adolescents (Carter et al., 2016; Colten et al., 2006). SBMD are
common among adolescents and the use of these devices during the
night remains high. In the UK, 12 to 15-year-olds are known to be the
largest users of SBMD among children (“Children and parents: media use
and attitudes report 2016 - Ofcom,” 2017). It is estimated that 98% of UK
adolescents aged 12 to 15-years-old watch television and over 90% of
them use mobile phones at home (“Children and parents: media use and
attitudes report 2016 - Ofcom,” 2017).
Earlier studies have shown traditional non-portable SBMD such as
televisions, video game consoles and desktop computers to be asso-
ciated with insufficient sleep duration and quality (Hale and Guan,
2015; Kenney and Gortmaker, 2017), although a recent study found no
such effect of computer use (Li et al., 2007). The use of portable SBMD
such as mobile phones and tablets has also been associated with adverse
adolescent sleep outcomes. However, many of the studies to date have
only focused on a single device (Schweizer et al., 2017), general (day
and night) SBMD use (Foerster and Röösli, 2017; Schweizer et al.,
2017), one sleep outcome (Lange et al., 2017), or not separated
weekday and weekend sleep habits (Fobian et al., 2016). As a con-
sequence of poor sleep hygiene among adolescents, the use of SBMD
either throughout the day or at night has also been shown in some
studies to be associated with poor health related quality of life (HRQoL)
among adolescents (Foerster and Röösli, 2017; Schoeni et al., 2015).
SBMD use, including the use of mobile phones at night, may reduce
physical wellbeing among adolescents via symptoms such as headaches,
tinnitus, stomach ache, back ache or high body mass index (BMI)
(Hutter et al., 2010; Lajunen et al., 2007). Although the advent of SBMD
such as televisions was expected to increase family cohesion and social
connection (Rothschild and Morgan, 1987), recent literature shows that
increased SBMD use is associated with increased likelihood of social
isolation and peer victimization among adolescents (Pagani et al.,
2016). Further, a recent study of a cohort of Japanese adolescents re-
vealed that SBMD use after lights out was associated with increased risk
of suicidal thoughts, self-harm and poor mental health (Oshima et al.,
2012). However, research on associations between night-time SBMD
use composite HRQoL measures is scanty.
We have recently set up the Study of Cognition Adolescents and
Mobile Phones (SCAMP), a cohort of adolescents from diverse ethnic
and socio-economic backgrounds. SCAMP is the largest cohort of its
kind in the world, set up specially to focus in detail on use of SBMD and,
in particular, mobile phones and a wide range of cognitive, beha-
vioural, health, and educational outcomes. In this study, we investigate
the association between SBMD use within the hour before sleep (termed
night-time) and a number of HRQoL and sleep outcomes, separately for
weekdays and weekends, in the SCAMP cohort. We also examine these
associations taking into account the presence or absence of room light
when the device is being used.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design and participants
The present study is a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data
from the SCAMP study (Toledano et al., 2018). SCAMP is a large pro-
spective cohort study investigating whether adolescents' use of mobile
phones and other wireless devices influences their cognitive, educa-
tional, behavioural, physical and mental health outcomes. Baseline data
were collected between November 2014 and July 2016 from adoles-
cents in Year 7 (aged 11 to 12 years) from 39 schools in and around
London, United Kingdom. The adolescents completed a computer-based
assessment and provided self-report data on their SBMD use and the
aforementioned behavioural and health-related outcomes. In total,
6616 adolescents (52.4% females), representing 89.7% of the expected
number according to school registers, took part in the SCAMP study.
Details of participation rate and general characteristics of the cohort are
published elsewhere (Toledano et al., 2018).
2.2. Exposures
Adolescents were asked if they usually use any of the following
SBMD: mobile phone, tablet, eBook reader, laptop, portable media
player, portable video game console, desktop computer, television or
video game console, within 1 h before sleep. If adolescents responded
positively to this question they were subsequently asked, for each type
of device, if they usually use it with the light on in the room or in
darkness.
2.3. Outcomes
2.3.1. Sleep outcome measures
Adolescents reported when they usually got into bed, how long it
took them to fall asleep (i.e. sleep onset latency, SOL) and what time
they usually woke up using options provided in the questionnaire.
These responses were recorded separately for weekdays and weekends.
Weekday and weekend wake times were provided as 30-min interval
categories (e.g. 06:00–06:30 a.m.) anchored at “before 06:00 a.m.” and
“later than 02:00 p.m.”. Similar 30-minute interval categories were
used for bedtimes anchored at “before 08:30 p.m.” and “later than
03:00 a.m.” for weekday nights and “before 08:00 p.m.” and “later than
03:00 a.m.” for weekend nights. To derive sleep onset time and sleep
duration, the lower boundaries of the provided categories were chosen.
For SOL, the following response categories were provided: “I fall asleep
as soon as I get into bed”, “about 5 min”, “about 15 min”, “about
30 min”, “about 45 min”, “1–2 h”, “3 h or more”. To be consistent,
lower category boundaries were chosen, hence the categories were
translated
into
“0 min”,
“5 min”,
“15 min”,
“30 min”,
“45 min”,
M.O. Mireku et al.
Environment International 124 (2019) 66–78
67
 “60 min”, and “180 min”, respectively.
Sleep onset time and sleep duration were estimated from SOL,
bedtime and wake time. The midpoint of sleep was estimated by adding
half the sleep duration to the sleep onset time. These variables were
calculated separately for weekdays and weekends. Duration of social
jetlag was defined as the difference between weekday and weekend
midpoint of sleep, and catch-up sleep was defined as the difference
between weekend and weekday sleep duration (Wittmann et al., 2006).
Based on the recommendations of the NSF (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015)
and the normal school start times of adolescents in London, the fol-
lowing categorical variables were created to differentiate between poor
and good sleep hygiene: late weekday wake time (weekday wake time
later than 7:30 a.m.), late weekend wake time (weekend wake time
later than 8:30 a.m.), long SOL (SOL longer than 45 min), insufficient
sleep duration (sleep duration < 9 h), late midpoint of sleep (later
than the median sleep midpoint), abnormal catch-up sleep (catch-up
sleep exceeding 2 h), and social jetlag (duration of social jetlag ex-
ceeding 1 h).
Sleep quality was assessed using four standardised dimensions
from the Swiss Health Survey: difficulty falling asleep, sleeping rest-
lessly, waking up several times during the night and waking up too
early in the morning (Schmitt et al., 2000). Adolescents were asked how
often they had encountered these sleep quality problems during the last
four weeks using a four-point Likert scale (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, and
Often).
2.3.2. Health-related quality of life measure
HRQoL was estimated using the KIDSCREEN-10 (The Kidscreen
Group Europe, 2006). The KIDSCREEN-10 is a unidimensional 10-item
self-report instrument covering physical, psychological and social di-
mensions of wellbeing validated for use among children and adoles-
cents aged 8 to 18-years-old (The Kidscreen Group Europe, 2006).
Adolescents were asked to indicate the frequency or severity of each
item, using a five-point Likert scale (1 = never, 2 = almost never,
3 = sometimes, 4 = almost always, and 5 = always) or (1 = not at all,
2 = slightly, 3 = moderately, 4 = very, and 5 = extremely). The total
score (range: 18.5–83.8) for each participant was calculated as de-
scribed elsewhere (The Kidscreen Group Europe, 2006) with higher
values indicating better HRQoL.
2.4. Covariates
Sociodemographic and behavioural characteristics of the adoles-
cents including age, sex, weight, height, ethnicity, caffeine consump-
tion, alcohol consumption, smoking and exposure to second-hand
smoking, parental occupation and parental level of education were
collected during the computer-based school assessment. Directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs) (Textor et al., 2011) were used to select potential
confounders from the list of covariates mentioned above (Fig. 2 in
Mireku et al., 2018). In the DAG, the direction of the arrow was as-
sumed to move from SBMD use to sleep outcomes or HRQoL. DAGs
provide a structural approach to examine the relationship between an
exposure and outcome in order to avoid adjusting for variables that
introduce biases into the association (Shrier and Platt, 2008). Parental
occupation, parental education and school type were used as proxy data
for socioeconomic status of the adolescent.
2.5. Statistical analysis
The distributions of variables were checked independently and de-
scriptive analyses were performed for all relevant variables. Complete
case analysis was employed in all statistical analyses. Chi-squared tests,
Mann-Whitney U tests and two sample t-tests were performed (as ap-
propriate) to compare all variables by sex. Three main statistical
methods were used for inferential analysis:
(i) Unconditional logistic regression was used to examine the re-
lationship between each of the SBMD exposure variables and the
dichotomous sleep outcomes.
(ii) Ordered logistic regression was performed to assess the relation-
ship between each of the SBMD exposure variables and sleep
quality items.
(iii) Linear regression was used to examine the association between
each of the SBMD exposure variables and KIDSCREEN-10 score.
Crude models were run to show the unadjusted relationship be-
tween the exposures and outcomes. All models were then adjusted for
ethnicity, age, sex, school type, parental education, and parental oc-
cupation (using the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification
with 3 categories) as potential confounders based on the DAG. This list
of confounders is consistent with those used in other studies in-
vestigating the relationship between media use and sleep (Brunetti
et al., 2016; Schweizer et al., 2017). Also, post hoc analyses using Wald
test for equality of coefficients were performed to compare the coeffi-
cients obtained in the adjusted model for device use in a lit room and
device use in a dark room.
As sensitivity analysis, the adjusted model was further adjusted for
other covariates (i.e. BMI, second-hand smoking, and alcohol and caf-
feine consumption) in Model IIA. These covariates were not included in
the adjusted model because of the uncertainty of the direction of the
causal path with the exposure i.e. they could be potential mediators on
the same pathway. For the linear regression models with KIDSCR-
EEN-10 score as an outcome variable, further sensitivity analyses were
conducted by excluding adolescents who self-reported any disability
from the analysis (Model IIB).
All analyses were conducted using Stata version IC/13.1 for
Windows (StataCorp, TX). Statistical significance was defined as
p < 0.05.
2.6. Ethical approval
The North West Haydock Research Ethics Committee approved the
SCAMP study protocol and subsequent amendments (ref 14/NW/0347).
Head teachers of schools consented to participation in SCAMP. Parents
and adolescents were provided in advance with written information
about the study and were given the opportunity to opt out of the re-
search. The adolescents were also provided with the opportunity to opt-
out of participation on the day of the assessment. The opt-out recruit-
ment approach was expected to improve participation in an ethnically
diverse population, reduce selection bias, ensure feasibility of class-
room-based assessment and ensure a cost-effective study (Toledano
et al., 2018). The study was conducted in accordance with the De-
claration of Helsinki.
3. Results
3.1. Study participants, sleep habits and night-time SBMD use
The median (interquartile range, IQR) age of our study sample was
12.1 (11.8–12.4) years for males and 12.0 (11.8–12.3) years for females
(Table 1 in Mireku et al., 2018). The median (IQR) weekday sleep
duration was 8.8 (8.0–9.4) hours and 8.9 (8.0–9.4) hours for male and
female night-time SBMD users respectively compared to 9.3 (8.5–9.8)
hours and 9.3 (8.8–9.9) hours for male and female non-SBMD users,
respectively (Table 1). More than 70% of adolescents used at least one
SBMD device within the hour before sleep (Table 2).
Although male and female adolescents had the same median sleep
duration, slightly more females had an early wake time, normal SOL
and an early midpoint of sleep on weekdays (Table 3). Midpoint of sleep
was also > 1 h later on weekends compared to weekdays for both males
and females (Table 3). Compared to males, social jetlag (weekend-
weekday discrepancy in midpoint of sleep of 1 h or more) was more

 common among females (χ2 (1) = 41.23, p < 0.01). More than a tenth
of adolescents (17.6% males and 20.0% females) experienced abnormal
sleep catch-up. With reference to sleep quality, more females than
males reported having difficulty falling asleep, sleeping restlessly and
waking up often during the night (see Table 2 in Mireku et al., 2018).
3.2. Night-time SBMD use and sleep outcomes
Even though night-time use of at least one SBMD, mobile phones or
televisions was not associated with long SOL on weekdays, it was
consistently associated with poor sleep quality on all dimensions in-
cluding experiencing difficulty falling asleep and waking up too early
(see Table 3 in Mireku et al., 2018). Further, night-time use of the most
commonly used devices i.e. mobile phones and televisions was asso-
ciated with higher odds of late wake time on weekdays (Odds Ratio,
OR = 1.60, 95% Confidence Interval, CI [1.05, 2.44] and OR = 1.71,
95% CI [1.15, 2.55], respectively). Adolescents who used mobile
phones, televisions or at least one SBMD during night-time had higher
odds of insufficient sleep duration and late midpoint of sleep on
weekdays (Table 4). Night-time use of mobile phones, television or at
least one SBMD was associated with adverse outcomes for all the
weekend sleep variables considered in this study. Adolescents who used
at least one SBMD during night-time had higher odds of abnormal
catch-up sleep and social jetlag (OR = 1.40, 95% CI [1.15, 1.71] and
OR = 2.07, 95% CI [1.76, 2.43], respectively). Similar effects on catch-
up sleep were observed for night-time use of phones and televisions. In

 the sensitivity analysis, after further adjusting for BMI, second-hand
smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption, the increased odds of ad-
verse sleep outcomes (except for long SOL) among night-time SBMD
users persisted (Table 4).
3.3. Night-time mobile phone and TV use in a room with the light on or off
and sleep outcomes
The proportion of adolescents who reported adverse sleep outcomes
was consistently higher among those who used mobile phones or tele-
visions in darkness than those who used them in a room with the light
on or did not use them at all (Fig. 1 in this article and Fig. 1 in Mireku
et al., 2018). Further, there was a 31% increase in the odds of weekday
insufficient sleep duration among adolescents who used mobile phones
in a room with the light on compared to those who did not use mobile
phones during night-time. However, the odds of insufficient sleep
duration were 147% higher for adolescents who use mobile phones in a
dark room in contrast to those who were not night-time users of mobile
phones (Table 5). Whereas adolescents who used mobile phones in the
dark were more likely to have long SOL on weekdays (OR = 1.41, 95%
CI [1.11, 1.79]), those who used mobile phones in a room with the light
on were less likely to experience long SOL on weekdays (OR = 0.74,
95% CI [0.56, 0.99]) compared to non-users of mobile phones. This
inverse association between night-time mobile phone or television use
in light and weekday SOL persisted even after further adjusting for BMI,
second-hand smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption in sensitivity
analysis. However, adolescents who used mobile phones or television in
darkness were more likely to have abnormal sleep catch-up (mobile
phones: OR = 1.73, 95% CI [1.42, 2.11]; television: OR = 1.75, 95% CI
[1.42, 2.16]) compared to those who did not use mobile phones or
televisions during night-time. Except for weekday wake times, night-
time mobile phone and television use in a dark room were consistently
associated with higher odds of adverse sleep outcomes on weekdays
and weekends after adjusting for potential confounding variables
compared to mobile phone and television use in a lit room (Table 5).
As shown in Fig. 2, mobile phone and television use in darkness was
consistently associated with poor sleep quality (all four dimensions) but
use in a room with the light on was consistently associated with only
restless sleep. In general, adolescents who used mobile phones or tel-
evisions in a room with the light on reported worse sleep outcomes and
poorer sleep quality than those who did not use phones or televisions at
night-time however, this effect was even greater when phones or tele-
visions were used in the dark.
3.4. Associations between night-time SBMD, mobile phone and television
use and HRQoL
Adolescents who used at least one SBMD had significantly poorer
HRQoL compared to those who did not use any SBMD during night-time
(Table 6). Adolescents who used mobile phones during night-time re-
ported lower HRQoL (β = −0.80, 95% CI [−0.24, −1.36]) compared
to those who did not use mobile phones during night-time. The direc-
tion and significance of these associations persisted even after ex-
cluding children who had reported disabilities (Table 6). However,
there was no statistically significant association between night-time
television watching and HRQoL. Night-time use of mobile phones spe-
cifically in a light room was not associated with poor HRQoL but use in
a
dark
room
was
associated
with
lower
KIDSCREEN-10
score
(β = −1.19, 95% CI [−1.83, −0.56]) (Table 4 in Mireku et al., 2018).
In the sensitivity analysis (further adjusting for BMI, second-hand
smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption), watching television in
darkness was associated with higher mean KIDSCREEN-10 score
(β = 1.96, 95% CI [0.67, 3.25]) compared to no night-time television
use.
4. Discussion
This study has shown that night-time use of at least one SBMD, and
specifically mobile phones or televisions, was associated with adverse
sleep outcomes, particularly insufficient sleep duration, late midpoint
of sleep, abnormal catch-up sleep, abnormal social jetlag and poor sleep
quality (sleep disturbance) among adolescents. The observed associa-
tions were consistent for sleep outcomes on weekdays and weekends.
Although night-time use of mobile phones or televisions in a room with
the light on was associated with insufficient sleep duration and late
midpoint of sleep, the magnitude of the association was higher when
night-time use of mobile phones or televisions occurred in darkness.
Night-time use of at least one SBMD was also negatively associated with
adolescent HRQoL and this association persisted even after excluding
adolescents who report any disability. Night-time users of mobile
phones in darkness reported worse HRQoL compared to those who did

 not use mobile phones during night-time.
The present study contributes to the growing literature highlighting
the associations between SBMD use and both adolescent sleep outcomes
and HRQoL. Night-time use of at least one SBMD was common with
nearly three-quarters of adolescents reporting night-time SBMD use in
this study and this is slightly higher than the prevalence of 60% re-
ported in a UK-based study among adolescents of the same age range in
2010 (Arora et al., 2014).
Night-time use of mobile phones but not television was associated
with long SOL on weekends in the SCAMP cohort. This is only partly
consistent
with
previous
research
which
found
no
significant
association between television and mobile phone use and SOL (Arora
et al., 2014). The lack of significant association between night-time
television watching and weekday SOL is comparable to that reported by
Gamble et al. (2014) although they found a significant dose response
relationship between frequency of phone use and long SOL on both
weekdays and weekends. In this present study, we did not assess the
frequency of night-time SBMD use and this may have clarified the re-
lationship between night-time SBMD use and long SOL on weekdays.
Although the mechanism between SBMD use and long SOL is not well
established, a number of previous studies have reported increased
arousal and alertness from night-time use of SBMD. In particular,

 playing video games and engaging in stimulating tasks (puzzles) but not
passive tasks (reading) on SBMD increased arousal (Fleming and Rick
Wood, 2001; Ivarsson et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2018). Thus relative to
passive engagement when watching television, mobile phones and
video games require active engagement and alertness on the part of the
user and could lengthen the time until sleep onset. Further, the port-
ability of mobile phones implies that due to their continuous and
consistent usage, the degree of exposure to light emitted and resulting
ocular discomfort may be higher that from a traditional television
screen which are non-portable and only occasionally used by adoles-
cents (Kim et al., 2016).
In the present study, adolescents who usually used mobile phones,
televisions or at least one SBMD at night-time were more likely to ex-
perience increasing frequency of sleep disturbance problems including
difficulty falling asleep, restless sleep, waking up at night and waking
up too early in the morning. Previous studies have explored the re-
lationship between SBMD use and sleep quality using sleep quality di-
mensions similar to the ones used in this study (Gradisar et al., 2013) or
validated sleep quality scales (Arora et al., 2014; Brockmann et al.,
2016) or objective actigraphy data (Fobian et al., 2016). Regardless of
how sleep quality was assessed in these studies, the inverse associations
with night-time SBMD use persisted. The means by which SBMD de-
vices affect sleep quality is not well understood but previous studies of
children have revealed that those who had televisions in their rooms
scored significantly higher on sleep terrors, nightmares, sleep walking
and sleep talking and that sleep disturbance was significantly higher for
those who watched television in the evening (Arora et al., 2014;
Brockmann et al., 2016).
The weekday-weekend discordance in the observed associations
between night-time SBMD use and wake time may be due to enforced

 school start times which imply that most adolescents force themselves
to sleep once in bed in order to wake up in time for school. In fact, <
5% of adolescents woke up later than 7:30 a.m. on weekdays which
sharply contrasts with weekend sleep habits of nearly half of adoles-
cents waking up later than 8:30 am. However, when specific SBMD
were considered, we found significant associations between mobile
phone use or television watching and late wake time on both weekdays
and weekends which is similar to findings of previous studies that in-
vestigated wake time and specific SBMD such as computers, mobile
phones and televisions (Amra et al., 2017; Gamble et al., 2014).
Sleep duration has been the most commonly researched sleep out-
come in relation to SBMD use because adolescents are increasingly
sleeping fewer hours during school nights. In fact, the American
Academy of Pediatrics acknowledges insufficient sleep duration among
adolescents as a major public health issue (Adolescent Sleep Working
Group, 2014). In the present study, night-time use of mobile phones,
televisions and at least one SBMD was consistently associated with in-
sufficient sleep duration on both weekdays and weekends. These asso-
ciations are congruent with the findings of a recent meta-analysis of 20
cross-sectional studies which reported that the odds of insufficient sleep
is doubled for children who used portable SBMD around bedtime
compared to those who did not use any portable SBMD (Carter et al.,
2016). Other cross-sectional studies also found similar associations
between portable and non-portable SBMD and adolescent insufficient
sleep duration (Continente et al., 2017; Kenney and Gortmaker, 2017).
Cain and Gradisar (2010) hypothesised that night-time use of SBMD
displaces sleep time and other activities associated with good sleep
hygiene and thus results in later bedtimes and shorter sleep duration.
This hypothesis may explain the observed consistent association be-
tween night-time SBMD use and late midpoint of sleep and insufficient
sleep duration on both weekdays and weekends.
Adolescents who used at least one SBMD or mobile phones at night
had a poorer HRQoL compared to those who did not use any. The ad-
justed mean difference in HRQoL observed is equivalent to 20% of the
mean difference in KIDSCREEN-10 scores between UK adolescents of
normal and abnormal mental health status (Ravens-Sieberer et al.,
2008). These findings are in line with many previous studies although
different HRQoL scales were used (Foerster and Röösli, 2017; Lacy
et al., 2012). First, spending more time on SBMD has been reported to
be associated with increased consumption of sugar-sweetened bev-
erages, increased risk of sedentary behaviour and decreased likelihood
of physical activity among adolescents (Kenney and Gortmaker, 2017;
Poulain et al., 2018) which are in turn directly associated with obesity
(Robinson et al., 2017) and inversely associated with HRQoL in dose-
response fashion (Wu et al., 2017). Using the extended KIDSCREEN-52
questionnaire, a previous study 10 to 17-year-olds found that high
media device users reported the lowest scores for moods and emotions,
self-perception, parents and home life, and school environment
(Foerster and Röösli, 2017). Second, problematic mobile phone use has
consistently been shown to be associated with unfavourable psycholo-
gical outcomes including severity of anxiety and depression among
teenagers (Elhai et al., 2017; Tamura et al., 2017) which may be ex-
plained by increasing mental fatigue arising from long-duration use
(Ikeda and Nakamura, 2014). Although the aforementioned hypotheses
and findings from previous research may explain the observed asso-
ciation in the SCAMP cohort, the present study is the only one to focus
on night-time device use in lit and dark rooms and adolescents' HRQoL.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of
night-time mobile phone use or television watching taking into account
the presence or absence of room light on sleep outcomes and HRQoL in
an adolescent population. Night-time light exposure, especially short-
wavelength (“blue”) light emitted from SBMD, can suppress the onset of
melatonin synthesis, followed by an alerting response and thus reduce
sleepiness (Chang et al., 2015; Gooley et al., 2011). This arousal may

 become conditioned, by a learned association forming between bedtime
and wakefulness (Gamble et al., 2014). In this study, adolescents who
used mobile phones or watched television at night-time with the light
on in the room experienced worse sleep outcomes than adolescents who
did not use these devices at night-time. However, the effects were even
greater when device use occurred in darkness. This observation might
be due to factors associated with the large luminance difference be-
tween a dark room and the light from a SBMD. Thus, adolescents who
use SBMD in darkness are likely to suffer from strained eyes because of
sharp pupil adjustment to images from the only source of light, the
screen of the media device. Also, in a dark environment, the pupils of
the eye are usually dilated and thus the amount of blue light (peak
emission ~450–470 nm) passing through the pupil and thus suppres-
sing melatonin may be higher in darkness before the pupil adjusts to the
light source (Tosini et al., 2016).
Although mostly cross-sectional, a number of studies have reported
associations between chronotype and device use (Fossum et al., 2014;
Randler et al., 2016). These studies reported that adolescents of ‘Owl’
chronotype are prone to increased device use and thus suggesting a
potential reverse causation. On the contrary, a randomized crossover
study by Chang et al. (2015) found a 55% decrease in melatonin sup-
pression for participants who used the SBMD and no melatonin sup-
pression for those who read a print-book under the same ambient light.
This evidence supports the hypothesis of disrupted circadian rhythms
and diminished melatonin secretion resulting from SBMD use. More-
over, we found the odds of long SOL, insufficient sleep duration, and
late sleep midpoint, to all be greater for mobile phone use at night time
in the dark versus TV use at night time in the dark. As TVs have lower
blue light concentration than mobile phones, we would expect to see
mobile phone users with poorer outcomes than TV users. Our findings

 thereby support the melatonin hypothesis.
Alternatively, the observed association may only be a reflection of
potentially less discipline among adolescents who use devices in the
dark. These adolescents may have used these devices secretively
(without the knowledge of their parents) and thus could have done so
for longer hours than those who use the devices in a light room until
their parents tell them to turn the light off. Thus, the prolonged night-
time use of the devices may have resulted in later sleep times and
poorer sleep outcomes. Further, studies in animal models suggest that
exposure to light at night increases the levels of oxidative stress markers
and increase melatonin suppression (Ashkenazi and Haim, 2013). Stress
induced by exposure to blue light in the dark could therefore alter sleep
and HRQoL although little is known if the same effect occurs in hu-
mans.
In common with all cross-sectional studies, the present study lacks
temporal information between exposures and outcomes and, therefore,
cannot draw causal conclusions or exclude the potential for reverse
causation. Although most studies within this field use cross-sectional
data, and therefore lack temporal analysis, a longitudinal study of
which approximately 1800 children followed annually since age
6 months to 7 years found an increase of an hour per day in lifetime TV
viewing to be associated with a reduction of 7 min in sleep duration per
day (Cespedes et al., 2014). In our study, the use of questionnaires to
collect information on SBMD use, sleep patterns and HRQoL may have
resulted in social desirability and inaccurate reporting among adoles-
cents. However, we have shown that our adolescents self-report their
mobile phone usage through questionnaires fairly accurately (Mireku
et al., 2017). Future studies with prospective measures of daily screen
activity and sleep diary and/or objective measures of screen activity
and sleep would help to tease out these complex relationships. Finally,

 exclusive SBMD use was not assessed therefore adolescents who re-
ported using mobile phones could also use other SBMD devices.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the use of DAGs to choose con-
founders increases the internal validity of the study findings. As con-
founders cannot be in the causal pathway between the exposure and the
outcome, the direction of association between the confounder and the
exposure/outcome is highly important to avoid collider bias.
Future cohort and experimental studies are needed to corroborate
our findings and to investigate whether induced pupil dilation during
SBMD use in darkness and subsequent melatonin suppression explains
the observed associations in darkness that were stronger than those
observed when the light in the room was on. Prospective cohort studies
including both children and adolescents would provide temporally
defined data and also allow researchers to study how the association
between SBMD and sleep or HRQoL varies by age, in order to create
age-appropriate policy recommendations.
5. Conclusion
Overall, this study shows that night-time SBMD use is significantly
associated with adverse sleep outcomes and poorer HRQoL among
adolescents. Night-time use of mobile phones in a room with the light
on is associated with some adverse sleep outcomes but the magnitude of
the association is larger if use occurs in the dark. We recommend that
parents, teachers, health professionals and adolescents be made aware
of the associations between night-time SBMD use and sleep outcomes,
as these may impact on cognitive function and educational attainment.
In addition, interventions on healthy screen-based media use should
include curtailed use within an hour before bedtime and particularly in
darkness.
