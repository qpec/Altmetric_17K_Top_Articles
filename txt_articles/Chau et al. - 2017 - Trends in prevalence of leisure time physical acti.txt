egular physical activity plays a major 
role in maintaining good physical and 
mental health and in the prevention 
of non-communicable diseases.1 In 2011, 
physical inactivity was the fourth highest 
contributor (5.0%) to total burden of disease 
and injury in Australia;2 6.4 % of cancers, 
21.2 % of cardiovascular diseases and 29.7% 
of endocrine diseases were attributable to 
physical inactivity. Globally, it is estimated 
that physical inactivity causes 9% of 
premature mortality and cost healthcare 
systems Int’l$53·8 billion in 2013.3,4
In Australia, there have been calls for a 
coherent national action plan for tackling the 
problem of inactivity with an emphasis on 
multi-sectoral collaboration and investment 
in creating physical activity opportunities 
and monitoring population engagement.5,6 
Population surveillance of physical activity 
is essential to inform public health planning 
and programs, as well as to determine the 
effects of these efforts over time.7
To facilitate comparisons of physical activity 
data over time, identical measurement 
methods and instruments need to be 
implemented using a standardised monitoring 
system. Historically, physical activity 
monitoring in Australia has focused on exercise 
participation and leisure time activity.7 The 
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) began 
measuring leisure time exercise and walking 
participation in the National Health Survey in 
1989/90 and has since used consistent leisure 
time physical activity and questions survey 
methods in subsequent surveys.8-13 This paper 
presents 22-year trends in leisure time physical 
activity in Australians involving six time points 
spanning 1989 to 2011. 
Methods
Subjects and sampling
The Australian National Health Survey (NHS) 
is designed to obtain representative and 
national benchmark information on a range 
of health-related issues and to monitor trends 
over time. The NHS began measuring exercise 
and physical activity in 1989/1990 and in 
subsequent surveys conducted in 1995, 2001, 
2004/2005, 2007/2008 and 2011/2012. In this 
paper, we refer to surveys conducted over 
two years by the year in which the survey 
started (i.e. 1989, 2004, 2007 and 2011). 
The NHS used a stratified multistage area 
sample design and each survey consisted 
of nationally representative samples of the 
Australian population from randomly selected 
private dwellings in urban and rural areas of 
all states and territories. Trained interviewers 
conducted face-to-face interviews with

Abstract 
Objective: To examine trends in leisure time physical activity and inactivity in Australians aged 
15 years or older from 1989 to 2011.
Method: We used data from six Australian National Health Surveys conducted from 1989/90 
to 2011/12 in which physical activity was assessed using comparable questions. Analyses 
examined trends in the prevalence of sufficient physical activity (≥150 minutes/week 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) and of inactivity (<30 minutes/week moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity).
Results: The proportion of sufficiently active adults was 39.2% in 1989 and 40.7% in 2011 with 
an overall declining trend of 0.2% per year (p=0.012). The prevalence of inactivity was 38.7% 
in 1989 and 37.3% in 2011; the overall time trend by year was stable (OR=0.999, p=0.242). In 
women, sufficient physical activity decreased by 0.3% per year from 35.5% in 1989 (p=0.025); 
inactivity increased from 39.5% by 0.3% per year (p=0.004). In men, sufficient physical activity 
prevalence was 43.1% in 1989 with a steady trend; inactivity decreased from 37.9% by 0.5% per 
year (p<0.0001).
Conclusions: The prevalence of sufficient physical activity remains low and inactivity high. 
Women appear to be a key target group for intervention. Public health efforts have been 
ineffective over two decades for improving physical activity among Australian adults. 
Implications for public health: This research supports calls for a national physical activity 
action plan given the multitude of benefits from sufficient physical activity. Maintenance of 
consistent physical activity questions in future National Health Surveys will facilitate long term 
tracking of physical activity levels in the Australian population.

one person aged 15 years or over in each 
household. In surveys from 2007 onwards, 
interviewers collected responses using a 
computer-assisted instrument. Exclusions 
included: residents of non-private dwellings; 
households with members of non-Australian 
defence forces stationed in Australia; 
households with diplomatic personnel of 
overseas governments. Survey response 
rates for fully and adequately responding 
households were 96.0% in 1989, 91.5% in 
1995, 89.0% in 2001, 89.4% in 2004, 90.6% in 
2007 and 84.8% in 2011 (8-13). Access to NHS 
data was obtained through the Australian 
Bureau of Statistics Confidential Unit Record 
Files and Remote Access Data Laboratory 
(permissions granted to authors 1 and 2).
Physical activity measure
Respondents were asked about their leisure 
time physical activity with items about 
frequency and duration of walking, moderate 
and vigorous intensity physical activity (see 
Supplementary Table S1 for exact wording 
of questions asked each survey year). Minor 
variations across surveys included: the 2011 
survey used a ‘last week’ recall time frame 
while previous surveys used a ‘last two 
weeks’ recall period; a lower limit for walking 
duration of 10 minutes was used in 2011. 
The ‘last two weeks’ time frame was divided 
by two to allow comparisons with the 2011 
survey.14
Other measures
Respondents provided information about 
their gender, age, main language spoken at 
home (English, other), marital status (married, 
de facto, divorced, widowed, never married), 
highest post-school education level (degree 
or above, trade/diploma, no post-school 
qualification), household income, self-rated 
health (excellent, very good, good, fair, 
poor), and smoking status (current smoker, 
ex-smoker, never smoker). Respondents 
self-reported their height and weight in all 
surveys prior to 2011. In the 2011 survey, the 
interviewers used digital scales to measure 
respondents’ weight and a stadiometer to 
measure their height. Body mass index (BMI) 
was calculated as weight/height2 (kg/m2).
Analyses 
Analyses used SAS software Version 9.3 
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC, USA). We used 
weighting factors for each record that were 
provided by the ABS to reflect population 
demographics at the time of each survey 
and to account for the probability of being 
sampled as well as differential response 
rates across the population at each survey. 
Replicate weights were available for surveys 
in 2004, 2007 and 2011. We computed 
descriptive statistics using normalised 
weights with age (5-year groupings) and 
gender distributions standardised to that of 
the 2011 survey.
Being ‘sufficiently active’ was the primary 
outcome. We defined this as total physical 
activity ≥150 mins/week including walking, 
and with vigorous-intensity activity weighted 
by 2. A secondary outcome was being 
‘inactive’
, defined as total physical activity 
<30 mins/week. Descriptive statistics were 
tabulated by social-demographic factors and 
health behaviours. 
We examined the probability of being 
sufficiently active and inactive using simple 
and multiple logistics regression models 
adjusting for social-demographics and health 
related behaviour factors. Significant variables 
for adjustment were: gender, age, marital 
status, education level, household income, 
main language spoken at home, smoking 
status, self-rated health, and BMI. 
Analyses were carried out for each survey 
and trend analysis over the six surveys. Data 
from the six surveys were combined with an 
indicator variable for the year of survey and 
a continuous ‘year’ variable for linear trend 
analysis. Results are presented as percentage 
prevalences and odds ratios with 95% 
confidence limits.
Results
Characteristics of the  
population samples
Across the six surveys, greater proportions 
of people declined to state their household 
income (6.5% to 21.3%) and did not provide 
height and/or weight information (3.9% to 
16.4%). Proportions of people categorised 
as married (64% to 56.5%) and current 
smokers (26.0% to 17.6%) decreased, 
and those reporting having poor health 
remained similar (4.0% to 4.9%). Please see 
Supplementary Table S2 for more details.
The proportional distribution of main 
language spoken at home was similar 
across surveys, while that for post-school 
qualifications varied due to changes in this 
demographic measure used in surveys years 
1989, 1995 and 2001; the same education 
measure was used from 2004 onwards. Across 
survey years 2004, 2007 and 2011, about 
one-third of respondents had a trade or 
diploma as the highest level of post-school 
qualification and the proportion of those with 
tertiary education increased (16.7% to 23.2%). 
Prevalence of sufficient physical 
activity and inactivity, 1989 to 2011
Across the six survey years, we observed 
a stable prevalence of sufficient physical 
activity (Table 1); 39.2% in 1989 and 40.7% in 
2011. The test for trend across the surveys was 
not significant. The proportion of men who 
met physical activity recommendations was 
greater than in women and levels were stable 
over the 22-year period. 
The prevalence of inactive adults was stable 
across the six surveys overall (35-40%) (Table 
2). When stratified by gender, a significant 
decline in prevalence of inactivity was 
apparent in men and less so in women (Chi-
square test for trend = 10.37, p<0.001 in men; 
Chi-square test for trend = 3.88, p=0.049 in 
women)
Factors associated with sufficient 
physical activity and inactivity
Patterns of correlates of being sufficiently 
active were similar in men and women, 
although men had 35% higher odds of 
meeting guidelines than women. The odds 
of being sufficiently active decreased with 
increasing age group relative to the 15-34 
years age group, except for women aged 
55-74 years old who were 15% more likely 
to be sufficiently active. Men and women 
who spoke English at home, had a degree 
or higher education level, in the highest 
income tertile, reported being in excellent 
or good health, or were ex-smokers or had 
smoking information missing were more 
likely to be sufficiently active than those 
who spoke another language at home, with 
less than university level education, in the 
lowest income tertile, had good, fair or poor 
self-reported health, or were current smokers, 
respectively. Men and women categorized as 
‘married’
, in the second household income 
tertile, classified as underweight, overweight 
or obese, or were current smokers had 
significantly lower odds of being sufficiently 
active than those categorized as ‘not married, 
in the lowest income tertile, had normal BMI, 
or ‘never’ smokers, respectively. 
Odds of being inactive increased with 
increasing age; men and women aged 
75 years or more were respectively 2 and

2.7 times more likely to be inactive than 
those aged 15-34 years old. In both men 
and women, higher odds of being inactive 
were also observed for ‘married’ versus 
‘not married’; second household income 
tertile versus lowest tertile; BMI categories 
‘underweight’
, ‘overweight’
, ‘obese’ versus 
‘normal weight’; ‘current’ smokers versus 
‘never’ smokers. 
Twenty-two year trends in sufficient 
physical activity and inactivity
Relative to survey year 1989, the odds of men 
being sufficiently active were stable in 1995, 
significantly higher in 2001 (+10%), stable 
in 2005, significantly lower in 2007 (-14%), 
and significantly higher in 2011 (+7%). For 
women, the likelihood of being sufficiently 
active compared to 1989 was steady in 1995, 
significantly higher in 2001 (+6%), steady in 
2004, significantly lower in 2007 (-13%), and 
similar in 2011. Overall, there was a significant 
negative trend over 22 years observed for 
the prevalence of sufficient physical activity 
in women (0.3% decrease per year, p=0.025) 
but not in men (p=0.1442), after adjusting for 
covariates (Supplementary Figure 1). 
Compared to survey year 1989, the 
prevalence of inactivity in men was steady in 
1995, significantly lower in 2001 (-31%) and 
2004 (-19%), steady in 2007, and significantly 
lower in 2011 (-16%). In women, the odds 
of being inactive compared to 1989 were 
significantly lower in 1995 (-8%) and 2001 
(-24%), similar in 2004, significantly higher in 
2007 (+11%) and in 2011 (+9%). 
The overall trend for inactivity over 22 years 
after adjusting for covariates suggested a 
significant decline in men (0.5% decrease 
per year, p<0.0001) but a significant increase 
in women (0.3% increase per year, p=0.004) 
(Supplementary Figure 1).
Discussion
This study shows a decreasing trend in 
the prevalence of Australians engaging in 
sufficient levels of physical activity and stable 
levels of inactivity between 1989 and 2011. 
Overall, only two-fifths of the Australian 
population achieved sufficient levels of 
physical activity for good health over this 
22-year period, while a little over one-third 
were inactive. We observed a significant time 
trend suggesting a decline in the prevalence 
of sufficiently active women of 0.3% per year 
over 22 years but not in men. Additionally, 
our analyses show a significant decreasing 
trend in inactivity in men of 0.5% per year but 
an increase in inactivity of 0.3% per year in 
women from 1989 to 2011. 
These findings add to the current literature 
about long-term trends in population levels 
of physical activity worldwide. In a review of 
temporal trends in physical activity, Knuth 
and Hallal found global levels of physical 
activity were low (less than 50%),15 and 
most studies reviewed reported increases in 
leisure time physical activity (LTPA) and they 
concluded that “leisure-time activity levels 
tend to be increasing over time”
. Specifically, 
Knuth and Hallal found 17 studies showing 
physical activity increased over time, three 
studies showing declines, and five studies 
showing stable levels.15 More recent trend 
studies add evidence indicating increasing 
population levels of physical activity in 
countries such as Denmark, Finland and 
Brazil.16-18 These Australian data indicate 
the opposite trend in Australia; that the 
proportion of adults who are sufficiently 
active has decreased by 0.2% per year from 
1989 to 2011. Earlier research has noted short 
term declining physical activity prevalence in 
Australia from 1997 to 2000 using a different 
measure.19
There are two possible explanations for 
the different temporal trends observed in 
Australia. First, the timeframe in the present 
study is relatively long compared to those 
from the studies reviewed by Knuth and 
Hallal.15 Second, among studies that have 
used consistent physical activity measures 
over a longer timeframe (over 10 years), 
the disparate methods used to measure 
and define physical activity participation 
in different countries make comparisons 
between surveillance systems difficult. 
A recent Finnish study reported that the 
proportion of adults classified as having 
‘high’ leisure time physical activity increased 
between 1982 and 2012 in seven FINRISK 
surveys.17 FINRISK assessed physical activity 
using the same categorical self-report 
question and respondents who selected the 
top two response options were classified 
as engaging in ‘high’ LTPA. In another study 
using an unchanged set of categorical 
questions to measure physical activity, 
Petersen et al. found upward trends in highly 
physically active Danish adults from 1987 
to 2005.16 A study examining patterns of 
physical activity in Canadian adults from 1981 
to 2005 using identical questions and scoring 
found sufficient physical activity, defined as 
≥3 MET-hours/day, increased significantly 
over 20 years.20 These Australian data 
contribute important new long-term evidence 
to the currently small literature base about 
long-term population surveillance (more than 
10 years) of physical activity with consistent 
measures and multiple survey time points.
Another possible explanation for our findings 
is that physical activity was measured using 
consistent, comparable questions with similar 
survey methods in the Australian NHS while 
physical activity questions may have changed 
in other surveillance systems. Researchers 
have previously reported on limited 
comparability of data collected from different 
surveys within the same surveillance system 
due to changes in survey methods and/or 
changes to the physical activity measure.21,22 
For example, the physical activity component 
of the Health Survey for England has changed 
several times since the original questions in 
1991 such that Stamatakis and colleagues 
could only examine physical activity trends 
for three surveys conducted from 1999 to 
2004 due to limited comparability with 
earlier surveys.21 Thus, changes to questions 
and survey methods may mask real trends 
in physical activity due to the inability to 
determine whether observed trends are due 
to real changes in population behaviour 
or due to changes in methodology. It is 
important for researchers to report the details 
of the physical activity measure used as well 
as acknowledge any changes in the measure 
and/or survey method to facilitate the 
accurate interpretation of their findings. 
We estimated the 2011 prevalence of physical 
inactivity (defined as <30 min/week) to be 
40% in women and 34.5% in men, higher 
than the mean global prevalence of inactivity 
of 31.1% (range: 17% to 43%) derived using 
the same WHO definition, but consistent with 
levels observed in high income countries.23 
We observed inactivity trends suggesting 
increases in women and decreases in men 
but this is difficult to compare with previous 
studies due to differences in definition of 
physical inactivity and a paucity of studies 
with trend data. For instance, the prevalence 
of inactivity in Mexico (defined as <150 min/
week of MVPA) increased from 13.4% in 
2006 to 19.4% in 2012 (two surveys);24 while 
leisure-time inactivity in Canada (defined 
as energy expenditure <1.5 kcal/kg/day) 
decreased from 58% to 48% in men and from 
63% to 50% in women.25
The patterns of correlates found in this 
study are consistent with those observed

a: Leisure time physical activity calculated as sum of time in walking, moderate and vigorous intensity activity (vigorous weighted by 2)
b: Adjusted for all other variables in the model
c: ‘Married’ = married or de facto; ‘not married’ = separated, divorced, widow, never married
d: Only four categories used in 1989/90 survey
previously: sufficient physical activity was 
related to being male, inversely related to age 
and BMI, and positively related to education 
level, household income, and self-reported 
health;26 inactivity was related to being 
female, positively related to age and BMI, and 
inversely related to education and household 
income.23 Our findings reinforce the need to 
focus on specific population subgroups for 
targeted physical activity intervention, such 
as women, older adults and those with lower 
education levels. 
The strengths of this study were: the use of 
consistent sampling and survey methods 
allowing for comparable leisure time 
physical activity estimates over six surveys 
spanning two decades; and the large 
population representative sample of each 
survey providing sufficient statistical power 
for analyses. While the self-reported nature 
of the physical activity measure may have

introduced possible social desirability biases 
and recall error, this was likely minimal given 
the relatively small changes in physical 
activity prevalence or lack thereof over the 
two decades examined. Nonetheless, it is 
possible that interpretation of the questions, 
albeit consistently worded, may have 
changed over two decades, and obscured real 
trends or generated false patterns. It would 
be advantageous to have objectively assessed 
physical activity data, but this is an expensive 
and logistically complex undertaking at the 
population level and was also not possible in 
earlier surveys. 
Another limitation was our analytic approach 
which divided the two-week recall time 
frame of earlier surveys by two to enable 
comparisons with the 2011 survey, which 
used a one-week time frame, as well as 
weighting vigorous minutes by two.14 
While the prevalence of sufficient activity 
estimated via this approach could be 
slightly lower than those derived by other 
surveillance instruments, the AHS physical

activity instrument demonstrates acceptable 
repeatability, which is an important 
characteristic for continued population 
monitoring.
Conclusion
These data indicate a lack of improvement 
in sufficient leisure time physical activity and 
inactivity levels among Australian adults over 
two decades, and suggest that public health 
efforts have had limited success in addressing 
this risk factor, compared to major and 
successful reductions in tobacco use.27 Key 
target groups remained consistent across this 
period, with women and older adults needing 
particular attention. It is worrying that 
inactivity prevalence in women increased, 
when the benefits are greatest in motivating 
the inactive. Finally, the strengths in 
comparable measures should be maintained 
in future physical activity surveys, especially 
if targeted population level interventions 
are introduced that may reverse this stable 
pattern of activity. Australia has adopted 
the World Health Organisation’s NCD Global 
Monitoring Framework,28 including the target 
of reducing physical inactivity by 10% by 
2025. The need for an Australian national 
physical action plan has never been clearer 
nor more urgent.6
