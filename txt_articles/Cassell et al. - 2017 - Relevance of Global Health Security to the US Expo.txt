To reduce the health security risk and impact of outbreaks around the world, the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and its partners are building capabilities to prevent, detect, and contain outbreaks in 49 global health security
priority countries. We examine the extent of economic vulnerability to the US export economy posed by trade disruptions in
these 49 countries. Using 2015 US Department of Commerce data, we assessed the value of US exports and the number of
US jobs supported by those exports. US exports to the 49 countries exceeded $308 billion and supported more than 1.6
million jobs across all US states in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, oil and gas, services, and other sectors. These exports
represented 13.7% of all US export revenue worldwide and 14.3% of all US jobs supported by all US exports. The economic
linkages between the United States and these global health security priority countries illustrate the importance of ensuring
that countries have the public health capacities needed to control outbreaks at their source before they become pandemics.

any challenges exist worldwide that increase the
risk of outbreaks and impede prevention, rapid re-
sponse, and containment of health security threats. These
challenges include increased risk of infectious pathogens
‘‘spilling over’’ from animal reservoirs to human hosts,
development of antimicrobial resistance, spread of infec-
tious diseases by global migration, acts of bioterrorism, and
weak public health infrastructures.1,2 In addition to these
increased risks, the efficiency of the global transportation
network means that an infectious pathogen can be carried
from a remote village to major cities across 6 continents
within 36 hours and could cause a large-scale outbreak or
pandemic.3 The world’s interconnectivity was illustrated
during the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic, when
cases of Ebola occurred in 10 countries, including 4 cases
in the United States.4 Outbreaks, even without crossing

 borders, can disrupt trade flows by destabilizing econo-
mies that serve as export markets. For example, Lee and
McKibbin estimated the global economic impact of the
2002-03 SARS epidemic was almost US$40 billion.5
Bloom and colleagues estimated that the economic conse-
quences for Asia for an avian influenza outbreak that lasted
a full year would cause a reduction of approximately
US$283 billion in demand and US$14 billion in supply
worldwide.6
To prevent large-scale outbreaks, the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working with
partners in 49 global health security priority countries to
improve the capabilities of public health infectious disease
laboratories, workforce, and surveillance and response sys-
tems.7,8 These activities enhance global health security by
building national capabilities to prevent, rapidly detect, and
control infectious disease outbreaks at their sources, before
they cross borders and cause widespread health and eco-
nomic disruption.2,7-9 To better characterize US economic
linkages to the 49 health security priority countries, we
assessed the value of US goods and services exported to
these priority countries and the number of US jobs sup-
porting those exports. This assessment quantifies the extent
of economic vulnerability to the US export economy posed
by trade disruptions in these 49 countries.
Methods
We defined global health security priority countries (priority
countries) as meeting 1 or both of the following inclu-
sion criteria: (1) countries designated by the US govern-
ment as Phase I or Phase II countries under the Global
Health Security Agenda (GHSA),7,8 and (2) countries host-
ing a CDC Global Disease Detection (GDD) center10,11 (see
supplementary material for full list of countries: http://
online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/hs.2017.0051/
suppl_file/Supp_Data.pdf). These criteria were used to
ensure inclusion of key countries that receive CDC assistance
for global health security work, ranging from minimal
technical assistance for GHSA Phase II countries, to a 5-year
commitment to provide both technical assistance and some
funding to GHSA Phase I countries, to longer timeframe
technical partnerships and funding for countries designated
as GDD countries.
We assessed the value of US exports and jobs supported
by such exports to the priority countries using publicly
available data sets.12-15 Data that record the value of ma-
terial goods exported from individual US states are acces-
sible through the International Trade Administration’s
(ITA) Trade Policy Information System (TPIS) and were
available for all 49 priority countries.15 The US Depart-
ment of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
data depict the value of services exported to countries with a
free trade agreement with the United States (see Supple-
mentary Material: Appendix for definition of service ex-
ports at http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/
hs.2017.0051). Data for service-related exports exist for
only 10 of the priority countries. Service-related export data
for those 10 countries were included in our analysis. The
value of exports refers to the summation of both goods
and services. We also calculated the proportion of world-
wide exports that went to the 49 priority countries and
the corresponding proportion of all export-supporting US
jobs related to exports to priority countries. The numbers of
US jobs supported by material goods and/or services ex-
ported were generated from analyses of US Department of
Commerce data.14-17
Because China is the largest destination country of all
priority countries, we analyzed the aggregated export values
and US jobs supported by these exports including and ex-
cluding China.15 For all analyses, we used 2015 data, which
were the most recent available. Additional details regarding
the data and our analytical assumptions are in the Appendix
(see Supplementary Material: Appendix).
Results
In 2015, the estimated total value of US material goods
and/or services exported to all countries worldwide was
approximately $2.3 trillion (Table 1). The total value of US
exports to the 49 priority countries was more than $308
billion, including over $222.5 billion in material goods
and over $85.9 billion in services exported. This rep-
resented 13.7% of all US exported material goods world-
wide (Table 1). For the 49 priority countries, the largest
export sector was manufactured goods and services, totaling
over $178.9 billion and constituting 80.4% of the total
value of exported material goods to priority countries
(Table 1). The second largest material goods export sector
was agricultural goods, followed by other exports and
mining, oil, and gas (Table 1). Sector-specific proportions
of exports varied by state (Appendix Table 1).
China was the largest single importer of US exports,
importing more than $164.5 billion of material goods and/
or services (Appendix Table 2). The next 3 largest importers
among the priority countries were all in South Asia and
Southeast Asia: India, Malaysia, and Thailand (imports of
$39.6 billion, $15.1 billion, and $13.9 billion, respective-
ly). South Africa was the largest importer in sub-Saharan
Africa, with over $8.6 billion in US imports. This was
almost double the $4.8 billion imported by Egypt. Peru was
the largest importer among the priority countries, im-
porting over $12.6 billion worth of goods and services from
the United States (Appendix Table 2).
The total value of material goods exported from spe-
cific US states to the 49 priority countries varied, with
Washington ($28.8 billion), California ($27.2 billion),
and Texas ($26.1 billion) having the largest export values
(Figure 1, Appendix Table 1). California, Texas, and
Washington also were the largest exporters of manufactured

 goods to the priority countries, with each exporting more
than $21.5 billion (Appendix Table 1). For agricultural
exports, Louisiana had the largest export value at nearly
$6.5 billion. After Louisiana, states with the next largest
agriculture export values were Washington, California,
Texas, Illinois, and Ohio.
Overall, in 2015, US exports of material goods and
services to 49 priority countries supported 1,644,200 US
jobs, or 14.3% of the US total of over 11.5 million export-
related jobs (Table 1 and Appendix Table 2). The largest
numbers of US export-related jobs were linked to exports to
priority countries in Asia (Figure 2, Appendix Table 2).
Numbers of US jobs supported by these exports varied
greatly by volume of exports per destination country. Ex-
ports to Montserrat, for example, were quite limited, and
only 30 US export-related jobs could be attributed to that
country (Appendix Table 2).
Exports to China constituted 53.3% of total exports to
the priority countries. Excluding China, the overall value of
exports to the remaining 48 countries totaled approxi-
mately $144 billion, representing 6.4% of the total value
of all US exports globally. Exports to these 48 priority

Discussion
In 2015, the total value of US exports to 49 global health
security priority countries exceeded $308 billion. Those
exports supported more than 1.6 million American jobs
across all US states and involved numerous sectors, in-
cluding manufacturing, agriculture, mining, oil and gas,
and service industries. This substantial economic export
activity to the 49 priority countries suggests that economic
disruptions in those 49 countries, including those associ-
ated with infectious disease outbreaks, could result in re-
duced demand for US exports. The US export economy is
vulnerable to economic disruptions, and such disruptions
could negatively affect US export-supporting jobs.
Not unexpectedly, we found a strong link between the
US economy and China, and China accounted for over
50% of the US exports to the 49 priority countries.
However, our findings that all US states have jobs and
exports connected to global health security priority coun-
tries remained consistent even when China was removed
from the analysis.
Our sector-specific findings showed that manufactured
goods comprised a large majority of exports to the 49
priority countries. Given that 2015 industry data showed
that the manufacturing sector supported a higher propor-
tion of jobs than any other sector,18 it is likely that
manufacturing-related exports to these priority countries
also supported the majority of export-related jobs.
Our analysis has several limitations, at least 2 of which
are due to the nature of available data. We lacked service-
export data for 39 of the 49 priority countries, which means
we likely underestimated the value of exports and associated
jobs for those countries. Also, it was not possible to de-
termine the original US state where goods were actually
produced, as available data only report the US state from
where the final goods were exported.12,15 Consequently, we
were not able to calculate state-specific numbers of export-
supported jobs. Future analyses, including assessments of
pandemic-specific impacts and state- and sector-specific
impacts on exports and jobs, could further characterize the
linkages between US exports and jobs and global health
security.
In addition, our estimates included only the dollar value
of the exports themselves. We have not included estimates
of the additional impact on the US economy due to ex-
ports. It is difficult to calculate the additional export-related
impacts on the US gross domestic product, and such an
analysis is beyond the scope of this article. However, prior
work suggests that exports are directly correlated with
economic growth.19 Finally, the economic vulnerability of
the United States to infectious disease outbreaks is likely to
extend well beyond just exports and export-supporting jobs
and include broader, and potentially larger, impacts stem-
ming from the fear of contagion on travel, tourism, and
imports, especially if cases occur in the United States, as
they did in the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak.4
Demonstrating in detail the extent to which CDC’s ef-
forts and partnerships have resulted in improved cap-
abilities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease
outbreaks in the priority countries is also beyond the scope
of this analysis, but, in sum, clear progress has been made in
many countries.7,8 Nevertheless, critical gaps remain, and
many priority countries are working to improve on initial
low scores related to pandemic preparedness, as measured
by the World Health Organization’s use of the Joint Ex-
ternal Evaluation (JEE) tool.20,21 Countries continue to
improve their public health capabilities to rapidly prevent,
detect, and control infectious disease outbreaks. The eco-
nomic links between the US export economy and global
health security suggest that continued capacity-building in
other countries may be important to protect US exports,
export-related jobs, and the broader economy from out-
break-related disruptions. According to the Commission
on a Global Health Risk Framework, investments in
building such capacities could be cost-saving. The com-
mission estimated that pandemics are likely to cost over
$6 trillion in the next century, with an annualized expected
loss of more than $60 billion for potential pandemics.
However, the commission recommended that a $4.5 billion
per year investment in building global capacities would
avert the high cost of pandemics.1
Building on the present assessment of US export data, a
related recent analysis of hypothetical outbreak scenarios in
Southeast Asia suggested a substantial impact of outbreak
disruptions on US exports and export-supporting jobs.22
Combined with the present analysis, these analyses illus-
trate the potential economic disruption to the US export
economy and our export-supporting jobs should a large-
scale outbreak occur in any of the global health security
priority countries.22 These findings may be useful to inform
decisions about the value of public health programs, in-
vestments, and policies aimed at building public health
capacity worldwide. When all countries are able to rapidly
prevent, detect, and control outbreaks at their source, the
risk of large outbreaks and pandemics can be reduced and
global health security enhanced.
