Vacant and blighted urban land is a widespread and potentially risky
environmental condition encountered by millions of people on a
daily basis. About 15% of the land in US cities is deemed vacant or
abandoned, an area roughly the size of Switzerland. In a citywide
cluster randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effects of
standardized, reproducible interventions that restore vacant land
on the commission of violence, crime, and the perceptions of fear
and safety. Quantitative and ethnographic analyses were included in
a mixed-methods approach to more fully test and explicate our find-
ings. A total of 541 randomly sampled vacant lots were randomly
assigned into treatment and control study arms; outcomes from po-
lice and 445 randomly sampled participants were analyzed over a
38-month study period. Participants living near treated vacant lots
reported significantly reduced perceptions of crime (−36.8%, P <
0.05), vandalism (−39.3%, P < 0.05), and safety concerns when going
outside their homes (−57.8%, P < 0.05), as well as significantly in-
creased use of outside spaces for relaxing and socializing (75.7%, P <
0.01). Significant reductions in crime overall (−13.3%, P < 0.01), gun
violence (−29.1%, P < 0.001), burglary (−21.9%, P < 0.001), and
nuisances (−30.3%, P < 0.05) were also found after the treatment
of vacant lots in neighborhoods below the poverty line. Blighted and
vacant urban land affects people’s perceptions of safety, and their
actual, physical safety. Restoration of this land can be an effective
and scalable infrastructure intervention for gun violence, crime, and
fear in urban neighborhoods.

lighted and vacant urban land is a widespread environmental
condition encountered by millions of people each day. About
15% of the land in US cities is deemed vacant or abandoned,
translating into an area roughly the size of Switzerland: over 3
million hectares of otherwise beneficial spaces remain neglected (1,
2). Urban residents, especially in low-income neighborhoods, point
to these spaces as primary threats to their health and safety (3).
Many cities have focused on complicated and expensive re-
sponses to their vacant land problem as part of large urban
transformation initiatives (4). These responses have typically been
intended to drive economic development and have often resulted
in the relocation of residents, or the transformation of vacant
spaces into luxury amenities or housing intended to economically
buoy depopulating neighborhoods. While these strategies can
change local economic conditions, they also can have the un-
intended consequence of displacing people who do not wish to
move, create further entrenched neighborhood segregation (5),
and may not adequately address the widespread problem of vacant
land that chiefly affects low-resource neighborhoods.
The widespread vacant land problem in US cities calls for
more than economic development or relocation programs. These
solutions can be expensive, may benefit select groups of resi-
dents, and may not reflect residents’ needs and preferences. A
recent, landmark randomized controlled trial demonstrated that
individuals who relocated out of low-income urban residences via
a voucher system had significant health and safety benefits.
However, subsets of these individuals, such as adolescent boys,
were also found to have been negatively affected by relocation and
over half of the study’s participants who were given relocation
vouchers opted not to use them (6, 7). This landmark study clearly
indicates the importance of neighborhood context, although the
high costs of relocation and the demonstrated preferences against
moving suggest that perhaps less expensive, “in situ” approaches
that can be applied to entire cities and allow residents to remain in
their existing homes deserve consideration (4, 8).
In situ approaches, such as the inexpensive restoration of va-
cant urban land in residential neighborhoods, have been shown
to affect economic outcomes (9). Such changes may also affect
health and safety outcomes, such as violence and crime (10),
although results have been mixed (11). On the one hand, low-
lying trees, shrubs, and other vegetation on patches of urban land
have been associated with greater fear of crime. Dense vegeta-
tion may decrease lines of sight and hide potential attackers and
illegal activity (12–15) and has been associated with greater
crime (13, 16–18). On the other hand, residents living near newly
greened vacant lots, greened alleys, or in public housing with
trees report enhanced feelings of personal safety (19–21) and
Significance
Blighted and vacant urban land is a widespread and potentially
risky environmental condition encountered by millions of
people every day. About 15% of the land in US cities is deemed
vacant or abandoned, translating into an area roughly the size
of Switzerland: over 3 million hectares of otherwise beneficial
spaces remain neglected. Urban residents, especially in low-
income neighborhoods, point to these spaces as primary
threats to their health and safety. Cities continue to seek
meaningful, evidence-based interventions for remediating va-
cant land. Standardized processes for the restoration of vacant
urban land were experimentally tested on a citywide scale and
found to significantly reduce gun violence, crime, and fear.

 other analyses link urban green space, street trees, and vegeta-
tion to lower levels of violence and crimes (18, 22–28).
Urban context matters in terms of human behavior. A conta-
gion of problems can spread from blighted, dilapidated, and
trash-strewn spaces to other nearby spaces, possibly leading to
violence and crime (29–31). Vacant land restoration is a po-
tential solution to these problems, yet mixed scientific findings
suggest that controlled scientific testing of inexpensive, stan-
dardized, and reproducible interventions would be of value (10).
To the best of our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has
tested such interventions on a citywide scale for a large repre-
sentative urban sample that includes low-income residents.
We conducted a citywide cluster randomized controlled trial of
standardized and reproducible in situ interventions to restore va-
cant land in a major US city and to test the effects of these inter-
ventions on violence, crime, and fear. The vacant land restoration
interventions tested were specifically designed to be inexpensive,
scalable, and sustainable changes to the basic lived environments
that residents encounter on a daily basis. Interventions were done
over a 2-mo period by teams of local landscape contractors.
A “main intervention” involved the cleaning and greening of
vacant lots across the city by removing trash and debris, grading the
land, planting new grass using a hydroseeding method that can
quickly cover large areas of land, planting a small number of trees
to create a park-like setting, installing low wooden perimeter fen-
ces, and then regularly maintaining the newly treated lot through-
out the postintervention period. The fencing was a visible sign that
the lot was cared for and deterred illegal dumping, but was pur-
posely low (about 1 m high) and included multiple ungated open-
ings to encourage entry and use of the newly greened lot by
residents. This intervention has been shown to be inexpensive and
highly cost-effective (32), with initial costs averaging about $5
per square meter and maintenance averaging $0.50 per square
meter thereafter (33). (Fig. 1 shows this process for two vacant lots
that are similar to those in the study but for purposes of confi-
dentiality are not actual study lots.) A second intervention involved
only the cleaning of vacant lots on the same regular maintenance
schedule throughout the postintervention period. This second in-
tervention was examined in combination with the main intervention
as an “any-intervention” treatment condition to test the effects of
performing any activity over doing nothing.
We tested the effects of these interventions on the commission
of violence and crime, as well as perceptions of fear and safety
among individual study participants, at a citywide level. To do this,
541 vacant lots from across the city were randomly sampled and
then randomly assigned to intervention and no-intervention con-
trol conditions. Police-reported crime and nuisance outcomes, as
well as outcomes from 445 randomly sampled nearby residents,
were collected citywide and analyzed over a 3-y period before and
after the study intervention period. We also incorporated a
qualitative ethnographic component to document protocol fidelity
and fully test, corroborate, and explicate ongoing hypotheses.
Results
Quantitative Findings. Baseline balance was evident in terms of
multiple variables at the participant level and the cluster level
between the three intervention conditions (Table S1). All 110 va-
cant lot clusters, and 445 participants within their clusters, initially
received the intended intervention to which they were randomly
assigned. This formed the basis of an intent-to-treat analysis that
was completed for all study outcomes. Despite their initial ran-
dom assignment, select numbers of vacant lots did not maintain
their originally assigned condition in the postperiod: some vacant
lots that were randomly assigned to receive interventions de-
teriorated and some vacant lots that were randomly assigned to
receive no intervention saw improvements in the postperiod
(Fig. S1).
Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses demonstrated significant
changes in participant-reported outcomes related to violence
and fear for one’s safety. Participants in the main vacant lot in-
tervention clusters experienced significantly reduced perceptions
of crime (−36.8%, P < 0.05) and vandalism (−39.3%, P < 0.05)
across all neighborhoods. This group also reported significantly
reduced safety concerns related to going outside their homes
(−57.8%, P < 0.05) and significantly increased use of outside
spaces for relaxing and socializing (75.7%, P < 0.01) (Table 1).
ITT analyses also demonstrated significant changes in police-
reported outcomes. Across all neighborhoods for the main va-
cant lot intervention, all crimes (−4.2%, P < 0.001), gun assaults
(−2.7%, P < 0.05), and burglaries (−6.3%, P < 0.001) were sig-
nificantly reduced after implementation. When considering any
vacant lot intervention across all neighborhoods, all crimes (−3.1%,
P < 0.001), gun assaults (−4.5%, P < 0.001), and burglaries (−3.9%,
P < 0.001) were significantly reduced after implementation. In
neighborhoods below the poverty line these effects were of similar
statistical significance but more pronounced with reductions in all
crimes (−4.7%, P < 0.001), gun assaults (−10.3%, P < 0.001), and
burglaries (−7.9%, P < 0.001). Nuisances were significantly reduced
after implementation of the main intervention across all neigh-
borhoods (−12.8%, P < 0.01) and neighborhoods below the poverty
line (−15.7%, P < 0.01) (Table 2).
Contamination-adjusted ITT (CA-ITT) analyses of police-
reported outcomes produced similar results to the ITT analyses
(contamination and potentially inaccurate results can occur when
participants in a randomized controlled trial do not adhere to their
assigned treatment. A CA-ITT analysis uses the random assignment
as an instrumental variable to adjust for noncompliance with the
randomly assigned treatment). Across all neighborhoods, all crimes,
gun assaults, and burglaries were found to be significantly reduced
after implementation of the main and any vacant lot interventions
(−9.2%, P < 0.01; −5.8%, P < 0.05; and −13.7%, P < 0.001). In
neighborhoods below the poverty line, all crimes, gun assaults, and
burglaries were also found to be significantly reduced after imple-
mentation of the main and any vacant lot interventions (−9.1%, P <
0.01; −17.4%, P < 0.001; and −14.6%, P < 0.001). These CA-ITT
effects were largest, however, in neighborhoods below the poverty
line that had experienced the implementation of any vacant lot
intervention: all crimes (−13.3%, P < 0.01), gun assaults (−29.1%,
P < 0.001), and burglaries (−21.9%, P < 0.001). Nuisances were
also significantly reduced after implementation of vacant lot inter-
ventions ranging from −27.5% (P < 0.01) for implementation of the
main intervention across all neighborhoods to −30.3% (P < 0.05)
for implementation of any vacant lot intervention in neighborhoods
below the poverty line (−28.1%, P < 0.05). All CA-ITT results had
first-stage F-statistics >100.0 (Table 3).
Displacement tests of the police-reported crime outcomes
showed no significant spillover effects of the intervention. In none
of the spatial scales studied was there a significant reduction in the
central radius area around vacant lots that was coupled with sig-
nificant increases in the ring surrounding this central area.
Ethnographic Findings. To monitor the potential effects of the rise
in property values that were occurring unevenly across the city
during the years of the intervention, we initiated more detailed
ethnographic case studies of reactions by neighbors to greening
interventions in two microneighborhoods: one in an area subject
to rapid economic development and one in a poorer area in
which property values decreased during the first 2 y of the study
and then stabilized.
The ethnographic team documented racialized tensions in the
rapidly developing area that included hostility to greening by
select residents. Ethnographers archived conflicts on social me-
dia that sometimes explicitly referenced vacant lot greening and
community garden initiatives, but most frequently focused on
city policies regulating row home renovations and property tax

 increases. They observed community hearings on community
redevelopment held by local politicians who were disrupted by
protesters from both sides of the divide. In contrast, in the more
blighted and poorer area, virtually all residents interviewed were
consistently positive about the greening of vacant lots. They also
generally welcomed renovations and bemoaned the ongoing
abandonment of decaying or undeveloped properties.
Open-air drug sales were visible in the ethnographically docu-
mented microneighborhoods and both suffered from high rates of
crime and firearm violence. The poorer microneighborhood was
more visibly impacted by drug trafficking, crime and gun violence,
as well as by vacant properties. In both microneighborhoods, the
team confirmed that drug sellers purposefully conducted business
in front of vacant properties to reduce the likelihood of being
“snitched on” (i.e., having the police called on them by neighbors)
(34). In this poorer microneighborhood dominated by open-air
illegal drug markets, residents routinely complained to the
ethnographers that they did not dare confront drug sellers unless
they were operating directly in front of the row home in which
they lived. On multiple occasions, ethnographers observed drug
sellers being shooed away from the front of occupied row homes
by both their drug bosses and occupants. On these occasions, the
sellers simply moved further down the block to resettle in front
of a vacant property or lot and resumed sales.
Our ethnographic field notes contain multiple references to
overgrown vacant lots providing concealment for routine drug use
and escape routes during police raids. Larger lots with rubble and
overgrowth often became open-air “shooting galleries,” where
heroin and cocaine users sometimes congregated to buy syringes
and inject behind bushes, discarded construction materials, or in
the ruins of buildings. The criss-crossing informal pathways to
shooting galleries through overgrown lots are visible in several of
our field video footage and Google Street View images. Despite
being located in one of the poorest areas in the city, drug sellers

 reported that they paid weekly rent to drug bosses (“bichotes”) for
the right to sell on blocks where inhabited row homes were in-
terspersed with vacant properties. Some of these blocks generated
rents of $5,000 a week to their bichote “owners.”
Ethnographers also documented over a dozen gun battles for
control of these inhabited, but blighted areas over a 7-y period
that overlapped with the dates of this randomized controlled trial
(35). Significantly, however, blocks that were too desolate and
uninhabited appeared to render drug sellers excessively visible to
the police and more subject to arrest on routine patrols. On
several occasions the ethnographers observed police officers
raiding vacant lots and buildings precisely because they noticed
that individuals were congregated inside them.
Police officers and Philadelphia community members re-
peatedly reported that vacant lots were “storage lockers” for il-
legal firearms. However, youth in the poorer, drug-impacted
microneighborhood reported that a gun was considered to be too
valuable and risky to lose to be hidden far out of sight in a vacant
lot behind overgrowth or mounds of garbage, lest it be found and
used by the injection drug users who frequented vacant lots to
hold up the nearest sales point. Instead, the ethnographers ob-
served guns and drugs being carefully stored in secured locations
that could be monitored easily from up to half a block away. The
ethnographers documented weapons and drugs being “stashed”
under couches in the apartments of trusted acquaintances on a
block, inside car trunks, behind camouflaged car panels, wheel
wells, muffler pipes, and under engine hoods. Significantly, these
cars were then often purposefully parked in front of vacant lots or
abandoned buildings. This gave them the advantage of remaining
more clearly within the line of sight of drug sellers while simul-
taneously reducing the chance of a mandatory felony sentence for
possession of a firearm in case of a police raid. The ethnographic
team also documented a shooting incident that occurred over a
stolen supply of drugs that, exceptionally, had been carelessly
stored out of direct sight. Notably, the shooter had more carefully
stored his firearm inside an apartment and walked back down the
block to retrieve it to punish the suspected thief (36).
Discussion
We completed a citywide randomized controlled trial of actual
place-based changes to urban spaces as a structural intervention to
reduce violence and fear among residents. We enrolled a random
sample of spaces and residents across a major US city and ran-
domly assigned these spaces to receive interventions to restore
blighted vacant land. These interventions significantly reduced
gun violence and other police-reported problems, such as bur-
glaries and nuisances. Randomly sampled residents who lived near
newly renovated spaces also reported experiencing significantly
less crime and vandalism, independently corroborating findings
from police-reported data.
A statistically significant −58% reduction in people’s fear of
going outside due to safety concerns and a 76% increase in their
use of outside spaces are meaningful shifts that greatly extend
the findings of prior quasiexperimental studies conducted at different

 times and in multiple cities such as Youngstown, Chicago, and
Philadelphia (22, 26, 27). In addition, given a city like Philadelphia’s
prior experience with gun violence (37), the −29% reduction found
in this trial could translate into over 350 fewer shootings each year if
the vacant land interventions tested here were scaled beyond just
the locations of the study to the entire city.
These findings add experimental evidence to an emerging
knowledge-base showing that cost-effective (32) structural inter-
ventions that are scalable to entire cities, like vacant land restora-
tion, can have significant and lasting effects on seemingly intractable
public safety issues such as gun violence and fear. Moreover, several
of the beneficial effects found here were most pronounced in the
poorest city neighborhoods, making these interventions useful to
policymakers and planners attempting to reduce economic and
quality-of-life disparities in effective, yet acceptable, ways for his-
torically underresourced urban communities.
Urban violence leads to fear, even among residents not di-
rectly involved in the violence itself. Together, violence and fear
can increase abandonment of previously vibrant city spaces and
lead to a spiral of blight and decay in urban neighborhoods (38).
As this experimental study has shown, direct changes to vacant
urban spaces may hold great promise in directly breaking the
urban cycle of violence, fear, and abandonment and doing so in a
cost-effective way that has broad, citywide scalability (8).
Blighted vacant lots visibly signal that a neighborhood has not
been attended to by the public and private sectors and that a
physically decayed infrastructure has taken over creating un-
managed public space conducive to incivilities and crime that may
be intimidating, demoralizing, or even have the effect of coopting
some residents. As a result, unsafe behaviors, such as gun violence,
can become sheltered and prevalent (3, 30). Such unsafe behaviors,
although committed by a small number of individuals, are often
street-based, occurring outside and in plain view for otherwise
unconnected residents to witness and personally experience, despite
not being actual victims of a crime or a shooting. These unsafe
behaviors may even have audible cues, such as the sound of a
firearm being discharged, extending their negative effects beyond
simply what people see or the spaces within which they occur.
It follows that the abatement of vacant lots studied here
generated enhanced perceptions of safety and reduced fear
among neighborhood residents, encouraging them to spend time
outside their homes and socialize with their neighbors. Our
ethnographic data documented that unwanted and illegal activity
that is often accompanied by gun violence, such as drug traf-
ficking, is able to proceed more easily in front of vacant lots than
it is in front of occupied residences. These data suggested that
sellers and drug bosses even sometimes respected the right of
neighbors to complain when sellers congregated directly in front
of their homes. The positive effects of increases in face-to-face
neighborly interaction are consistent with classic urban studies of
“eyes on the street” and social capital as being effective mech-
anisms for crime reduction and neighborhood stabilization. This
literature recognized the importance of sidewalk sociality, in-
teractive social support, and placed-based “moral economies” of
respect and solidarity in poor and working class neighborhoods
(34, 39). The physical environmental shift of vacant lot restora-
tion may have thus also led to a social environmental shift.
Ethnographic findings in the one poorer microneighborhood,
where the poverty rate was about twice the citywide rate, are
consistent with the greater magnitude of reductions in gun as-
saults, burglaries, and nuisances found in neighborhoods below
the poverty line. Another mechanism behind the significant re-
ductions in gun violence found here may be that vacant lots and
the immediate perimeters around them create out-of-sight
staging areas for illegal firearms until they are needed by indi-
viduals participating in illegal activity (3, 26, 40). Our ethno-
graphic data showed that illegal firearms were hidden in cars that
were then purposefully parked in front of vacant lots and
buildings to avoid alienating neighbors who would object to such
illegal activities directly in front of their homes.
The current cluster randomized controlled trial was un-
dertaken as a new extension of prior studies limited by residual
confounding and omitted variable biases. The study has also built
in and directly tested concerns of spatial displacement, demon-
strating that the reductions in violence found here were real
reductions and not simply the relocation of violence “around the
corner” (41). It has methodologically and analytically taken a
large step forward, although some limitations remain.
One limitation is duration. The study assessed the effect of
greening vacant lots over a reasonably long year-and-a-half follow-
up period, although we cannot know what the impact of these
interventions would be beyond the study period. However, prior
quasiexperimental studies of the same vacant lot intervention
found significant effects for some of the same outcomes, such as
gun violence, that persisted for over 3.5 y on average (26).
Another concern is that, although both pre- and postintervention
periods were 18-mo long and the preintervention period included
three winter seasons and one summer season, while the post-
intervention period included two winter seasons and two summer
seasons, our intervention period was driven by the choice of a
spring planting season that specified by the landscape contractors as
necessary and standard practice for successful land restoration. It is
possible that the findings we report reflect underestimates given the
greater occurrence of violence and crime during summer months.
However, the seasonal imbalance between pre- and postperiods was
equally experienced by both intervention and control groups given
the random assignment, minimizing this effect.
An overarching concern is that the interventions implemented
here, and any subsequent uses of this place-based intervention, may
lead to gentrification and the unintended displacement of residents
(42). This is possible, although prior analyses have found economic
indicators, such as property taxes, to be unchanged and, if anything,
reduced, after implementation of the greening interventions tested
here (26). In addition, over the course of this study, local municipal
legislation was also passed to limit property tax increases for
longtime residents in curtailing displacement due to gentrification
and only a very small percentage (<5%) of the vacant lots that were
remediated using the intervention strategies described here have
been developed into houses or commercial businesses (43; see also
https://phsonline.org/programs/landcare-program). Thus, almost all
of the vacant lots that were remediated remain open to residents
for continued use and recreation. Our results also suggest that there
are efficiencies for policymakers in focusing greening initiatives on
the most infrastructurally distressed neighborhoods.
The vacant lot greening interventions studied here were not
designed to lead to luxury housing developments or upscale,
single-site recreational installations that would act as destination
amenities to draw in nonresidents. They were explicitly chosen
because they were inexpensive, scalable, and designed to be in-
stalled immediately proximal to lived space, oftentimes in low-
income neighborhoods, to give local residents ready access to
new, albeit basic amenities that they otherwise would not have
had. Accompanying work has also found that newly greened
vacant lots provide informal and accessible recreation space to
nearby neighbors, based on evidence such as the accumulation of
picnic tables, barbeques, toys, and recreational equipment (44).
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that structural dilapidation and blight can
be key causes of negative outcomes in terms of people’s safety,
both their perceptions of safety and their actual, physical safety.
When left untreated, vacant and blighted urban spaces contribute
to increased violence and fear. The physical components of
neglected and impoverished urban environments can be changed
in inexpensive and sustainable ways as a direct treatment strategy
for violence and fear in cities. Restoration of vacant spaces using

 well-delineated interventions, such as those shown here, is a scal-
able and politically acceptable strategy that can significantly and
sustainably reduce persistent urban problems like gun violence.
The vacant land interventions shown effective here can be key
in spurring people-focused urban connectivity and the reestab-
lishment of vibrant, busy streets (39, 45). The effectiveness of
infrastructural interventions in decreasing gun violence and crime
and increasing perceptions of safety also offers a practical example
of a public health approach that transcends the conventional
model of targeting behavior change on the individual level. It
suggests that macrolevel upstream approaches can have signifi-
cant, positive population-level effects without conscious commit-
ments by individuals to lifestyle changes. In the mid-19th century
the disciplines of social medicine, public health, and epidemiology
emerged out of the success of large public investments in inter-
ventions like sewage and potable water infrastructure, which
curbed large-scale epidemics and transformed the health of entire
cities (46). Infrastructural approaches to improving population
health, such as those tested here, may again offer pragmatic, up-
stream strategies for addressing today’s complex urban challenges.
Materials and Methods
See SI Materials and Methods for a more detailed discussion of the materials
and methods used. The study design was a controlled, parallel-group, cluster
randomized trial that used a citywide random sampling procedure followed
by stratified random assignment of eligible vacant lots into intervention and
no-intervention arms in Philadelphia. All vacant lot interventions occurred over
a 2-mo period, from April to May 2013, with an 18-mo baseline preperiod and
an 18-mo follow-up postperiod. Observational ethnographic field notes were
also collected two microneighborhoods following a previously tested protocol
of direct, real-time participant-observation for randomized controlled trials.
This trial was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review
Board and registered with the International Standard Randomized Controlled
Trial Number (study ID ISRCTN92582209). Full and valid informed consent was
obtained from all participants as reviewed and specified by both the University
of Pennsylvania and the University of California, Los Angeles, Institutional
Review Boards. All sections of this paper were written using the Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials statement for the reporting of cluster random-
ized trials. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.
