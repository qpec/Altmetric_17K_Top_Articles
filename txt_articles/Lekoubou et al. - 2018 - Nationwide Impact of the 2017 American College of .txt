Background-—In this study, we aimed at estimating the prevalence and number of stroke survivors with hypertension,
recommended pharmacological treatment, and above blood pressure target, according to the 2017 American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines and the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on prevention,
detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure guidelines.
Methods and Results-—We included participants aged ≥20 years to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
between 2003 and 2014. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys is a series of publicly available, cross-sectional,
national, stratified, multistage probability surveys. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys received approval from
the National Center for Health Statistics Research Ethics Review Board. Stroke was determined by self-report. Blood pressure was
estimated according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey protocol. Assessment of pharmacological treatment of
hypertension was by self-report. The proportion and number of stroke survivors with hypertension was 49.8% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 45.4%–54.2%) and 2 361 075 (95% CI, 2 035 251–2 686 899) per the 2017 American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association guidelines versus 29.9% (95% CI, 26.2%–33.7%) and 1 415 974 (95% CI, 1 191 721–1 640 227) per
seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure
guidelines. Proportion and number of stroke survivors who were not at target blood pressure was 56% (95% CI, 51.2%–60.6%) and
1 824 106 (95% CI, 1 558 846–2 089 366) per 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines
versus 36.3% (95% CI, 31.6%–41.4%) and 1 184 655 (95% CI, 984 128–1 385 182) per seventh report of the Joint National
Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines.
Conclusions-—Compared with seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment
of High Blood Pressure, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelines would
result in a nearly 67% relative increase in the proportion of US stroke survivors diagnosed with hypertension and 54% relative
increase in those not within the recommended blood pressure target. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e008548. DOI: 10.1161/

ypertension is strongly associated with stroke.1,2 It also
carries a high mortality among patients with stroke and
arguably has a stronger association with stroke than any other
symptomatic vascular disease entity.2,3 It is fortunately
amenable to interventions including pharmacological treat-
ments. Antihypertensive drugs are among the most prescribed
medications in the United States.4 It is purported that greater
blood pressure (BP) awareness and treatment has significantly
contributed to the decline in stroke mortality in the United
States over the past decades.2 Indeed, a meta-analysis of 14
randomized controlled trials has shown a nearly 30% reduction
in the risk of stroke recurrence with BP treatment.5 In the
seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention,
Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure
(JNC7) guidelines, hypertension was defined for systolic BP
(SBP) ≥140 or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥90 mm Hg, and pharmaco-
logical treatment in stroke survivors was recommended for SBP
≥140 or DBP ≥90 mm Hg.6 However, epidemiological data
have demonstrated that the risk of stroke begins with levels of
BP lower than these values.7 In light of these data, the American

 College of Cardiology/American Heart Association8 guidelines
for prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of
hypertension have lowered the cutoff for BP definition of
hypertension in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events,
including patients experiencing stroke. In the new guidelines, a
SBP ≥130 or DBP ≥80 mm Hg defines hypertension in stroke
survivors. The new American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines also recommend
initiating antihypertensive treatments and targeting SBP/DBP
to <130/80 mm Hg for stroke survivors. It is anticipated that
these changes will affect BP distribution among stroke
survivors, with significant policy and economic implications.
In this analysis, using data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2014, we
estimated the percentage and number of US adult stroke
survivors according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines and the
JNC7 guidelines. Moreover, we estimated the percentage and
number of stroke survivors with hypertension recommended
for pharmacological treatment on the basis of the 2017 ACC/
AHA versus the JNC7 guidelines. We also estimated the
percentage and number of US adult stroke survivors taking
antihypertensive medication with BP above target, according to
2017 ACC/AHA and the JNC7 guidelines. Finally, we extrap-
olated the potential impact of the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines on
mortality among stroke survivors.
Methods
Data Source and Blood Pressure Measurement
We analyzed a 10-year period from 2003 through 2014 of the
NHANES’s data set of adult participants who had at least 3
consecutive BP measurements. NHANES is a series of publicly
available,
cross-sectional,
national,
stratified,
multistage
probability surveys. As publicly available data, the NHANES
data set, the methods used in the analysis, and materials used
to conduct the research are available to any researcher for
purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the
procedure. Details pertaining to the survey are available at
the NHANES website.9 NHANES received approval from the
National Center for Health Statistics Research Ethics Review
Board. All participants were asked to sign an informed
consent form. Per NHANES protocol, BP is measured by
trained physicians (who are annually retrained and certified)
using a mercury sphygmomanometer of appropriate size,
determined by the participant’s mid–right arm circumference.
BP is calculated as the mean of the 3 consecutive BP
measurements, obtained after 5 minutes of rest and at a 30-
second interval.
Study Variables
History of stroke was determined by self-reported diagnosis
by a healthcare provider. Individuals who had missing data for
previous stroke were excluded. Age was divided into 4
categories: 20 to 44, 45 to 64, 65 to 79, and ≥80 years.
Race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white (white),
non-Hispanic black (black), Mexican American, and other.
Assessment of pharmacological treatment of hypertension
was by self-report. Participants who answered “yes” to both
questions “Have you ever been told by a doctor or other
healthcare professional that you had hypertension, also called
high blood pressure?” and “Are you now taking prescribed
medication for high blood pressure?” were considered to be
taking antihypertensive medication.
Hypertension Definitions, Recommendations for
Antihypertensive Medications, and Blood
Pressure Treatment Goals
The JNC7 defined hypertension for levels of SBP ≥140 mm Hg
or DBP ≥90 mm Hg. According to the 2017 ACC/AHA
guidelines, hypertension was defined for levels of SBP
≥130 mm Hg or DBP ≥80 mm Hg. On the basis of the JNC7
guidelines, pharmacological treatment was recommended for
stroke survivors for SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg. It
was deemed reasonable to achieve a SBP <140 mm Hg and a
DBP <90 mm Hg. The 2017 AHA/American Stroke Associa-
tion guidelines recommend initiating antihypertensive treat-
ment in stroke survivors for SBP ≥130 mm Hg or DBP
≥80 mm Hg and set new target at SBP <130 mm Hg and
DBP <80 mm Hg.

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• The implementation of the 2017 American College of
Cardiology/American
Heart
Association
guidelines
will
result in a greater number of stroke survivors with
hypertension,
at
goal,
and
requiring
antihypertensive
treatments.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• There are anticipated challenges in implementing into
practice the new 2017 American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association
guidelines, with potential
positive impacts on cardiovascular risk reduction and
mortality among stroke survivors.

 Statistical Analysis
Frequency distribution and 95% confidence interval (CI) of
BP were calculated across the following BP levels of SBP/
DBP: <120/<80, 120 to 129/<80, 130 to 139/80 to 89,
and ≥140/90 mm Hg. They were calculated overall and by
sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Frequency distribution of
hypertension was calculated according to cutoff points
defining hypertension in each of the guidelines, overall and
by sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Next, we estimated the
number and 95% CI of adults with hypertension overall by
type of guidelines to the 2007 ACC/AHA guidelines by
treatment
status.
We
also
calculated
the
percentage,
number, and 95% CI of stroke survivors with hypertension
recommended for pharmacological treatment on the basis of
the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines. We then pro-
ceeded and calculated the percentage, number, and 95% CI
of stroke survivors taking antihypertensive medication with
BP above target, according to 2017 ACC/AHA and the JNC7
guidelines.
A binary variable of final “mortality” status (0=alive,
1=deceased) was created from publically used linked mortal-
ity NHANES files (2003–2010); a code of 1 indicates that the
mortality status was ascertained through a probabilistic
match to a National Death Index record (National Center for
Health Statistics Surveys 2011 Linked Mortality Files, public-
use data dictionary).10 Mortality rate was computed by BP
levels, as defined by the JNC7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA
guidelines.
All
prevalence
estimates
were
weighted
to
obtain
nationally representative estimates.11 All analyses were
performed using STATA 14.12 Level of significance was set
at P<0.05.
Results
General Characteristics
We identified a total of 6 250 751 weighted participants aged
≥20 years with stroke, including 2 600 312 men (41.6%).
Nearly 3 of 5 participants (57.6%) were aged ≥65 years.
Overall during the period 2003 through 2014, 34.2% (95% CI,
29.7%–38.9%), 16.0% (95% CI, 13.3%–19.0%), 19.9% (95% CI,
16.5%–23.7%), and 29.9% (95% CI, 26.2%–33.8%) of stroke
survivors had SBP/DBP levels of <120/80, 120 to 129/<80,
130 to 139/80 to 89, and ≥140/90 mm Hg. In general, older
participants, non-Hispanic blacks, and women had BP in the
higher levels (Table 1).
Prevalence and Number of Stroke Survivors
With Hypertension and Recommended
Pharmacological Treatment, According to 2017
ACC/AHA and JNC7 Guidelines
According to the JNC7 guidelines, 29.9% (95% CI, 26.2%–
33.7%) of stroke survivors, corresponding to 1 415 974 US
population, had hypertension and would be recommended
pharmacological treatment. On the other hand, on the basis of
the new recommendation, 49.8% (95% CI, 45.4%–54.2%; ie,
2 361 075 stroke survivors) met the criteria for hypertension
and would be recommended pharmacological treatment. The

New BP Guidelines and Stroke Survivors
Lekoubou et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

 Mortality Rate by 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7
Guidelines Among Stroke Survivors
Mortality rate during the period of 2003 through 2010 was
5.55% among those with a SBP <130 mm Hg or DBP
<80 mm Hg; meanwhile, for those with a SBP <140 mm Hg
or DBP <90 mm Hg, mortality rate was 8.25%, corresponding
to a 32.72% relative mortality reduction.
Discussion
In this top-down analysis, we found that implementing the
2017 ACC/AHA guidelines would result in a nearly 67%
increase in the proportion of stroke population with hyper-
tension, and recommended antihypertensive treatment. The
number of stroke survivors not at goal would increase by 54%
with the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines.
It is established that hypertension increases the risk of
stroke in a dose-response pattern. For example, in a meta-
analysis of individual data of 1 million adults from 61
prospective studies, the risk of stroke was evident for SBP
levels as low as 115 mm Hg and DBP starting at 75 mm Hg.7
Cardiovascular prevention benefits in patients with at usually
recommended BP goals compared with those at lower goals
have been evaluated in 3 pivotal clinical trials. The SPS3
(Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Stroke) trial, which
included patients within 18 months of index symptomatic
lacunar infarction, found no benefit of intensive BP on
cardiovascular prevention. The ACCORD (Action to Control
Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) trial and the SPRINT (Systolic
Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) did not include patients with
stroke and, therefore, no data on stroke secondary prevention
were available. In the ACCORD trial, which included only
patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus, no benefit on

New BP Guidelines and Stroke Survivors

 cardiovascular prevention was found.13–15 In the SPRINT,
lowering SBP to <120 mm Hg versus 140 mm Hg in people
with a SBP of ≥130 mm Hg and an increased cardiovascular
risk, but without diabetes mellitus, resulted in significantly
lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events
and death from any cause.15 In subgroup analyses, no benefits
on stroke prevention were apparent in both the SPRINT and
ACCORD trial. In all, aforementioned studies were limited by
the noninclusion of participants with stroke or the inclusion of
only a subpopulation of patients with stroke. Their results need
to be contrasted with the findings from a recent meta-analysis
of 14 randomized controlled trials of secondary stroke
prevention that demonstrated a linear and positive association
between BP reduction and the risk of recurrent stroke and
cardiovascular events. The authors suggested that a target of
<130 mm Hg may be effective for secondary stroke preven-
tion.5 Altogether, these studies were among the catalyzers that
helped revise hypertension definition, pharmacological treat-
ment recommendation, and BP targets in the 2017 ACC/AHA
guidelines. In addition to setting new cutoffs for BP definition,
pharmacological treatment recommendations, and targets, the
new guidelines have provided a new categorization into 4
levels. As in the JNC7 guidelines, the aim for defining these
categories was to facilitate clinical practice and public health
decisions. The JNC7 report categories included SBP/DBP levels
of <120/80 mm Hg (normal), 120 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg
(prehypertension), 140 to 159/90 to 99 mm Hg (hypertension
stage 1), and ≥160/100 mm Hg (hypertension stage 2). The
only category unchanged is the “normal BP.” Interventions,
including pharmacological and nonpharmacological, are rec-
ommended for lower levels of BP.6,8 The finding that less than
one third of stroke survivors have normal BP, according to the
new guidelines, is expected to trigger earlier pharmacological
interventions (for SBP/DBP >130/90 mm Hg) and lifestyle
modifications among stroke survivors. Lifestyle modifications
to prevent cardiovascular events in stroke survivors have been
well summarized in 3 recent meta-analyses.16–18 One of the
main findings from these meta-analyses is a 1.34– to 4.21–
mm Hg reduction in SBP with lifestyle changes. Although these
studies found no benefit of lifestyle changes on cardiovascular
events rates, the reduction in BP observed may be of significant
importance at a population level because a 1–mm Hg reduction
in SBP has been associated with a 4% reduction in stroke
recurrence rate19 and a 10% reduction in mortality rate.20 The
duration of follow-up in studies included in these analyses was
usually short, and the pooled number of participants was
relatively small, ranging from 2478 to 6373 participants. The
benefits of lifestyle interventions on cardiovascular rate
reduction in stroke survivors would be more robust with
prolonged and multimodal intervention, including pharmaco-
logical interventions. This was observed in other secondary
prevention programs, such as those for coronary heart
disease.21 There is also evidence from observational studies
that lifestyle modifications, including abstinence from smoking,
low body mass index, moderate alcohol consumption, regular
exercise, and healthy diet, decrease the risk of stroke and
stroke-related death.22 Such benefits would, in theory, be
greater in stroke survivors than in the general population.
However, as shown in this study, fewer than half of stroke
survivors would be at goal with the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines,
outlining the magnitude of efforts to deploy to implement and
disseminate the new guidelines. Lessons from prior guidelines
have taught us that improving hypertension control is a
complex task that includes, among other factors, patients’
motivation, appropriate communication between clinicians and
their patients, and careful cost of medication considerations.6
On a positive note, estimates from NHANES suggest that
achieving BP control at a large scale is possible. For example,
between 1976 to 1980 and 2007 to 2008, in the general
population, the rates of hypertension awareness, treatment,
and control have increased from 51% to 81%, 31% to 73%, and
10% to 50%, respectively.23 Attributing these changes to the 7
JNC reports on the detection, evaluation, and treatment of high
BP, published between 1977 and 2003, is difficult because
several government or professional society programs were
ongoing during the same period of time.2 In the general
population, the new guidelines will result in a substantial
increase in the prevalence and absolute number of people with
hypertension in the United States (from 31.9% according to the
JNC7 guidelines to 45.6% according to the new guidelines) but
in only a small increase in the percentage of Americans
recommended pharmacological treatment (from 34.3% to
36.2%).8,24 These conclusions contrast with a much higher
proportion of stroke survivors who will require pharmacological
treatment; the percentage of stroke survivors who will be
recommended antihypertensive treatment will increase from
29.9% to 49.8%. The societal gain if the new guidelines were
fully implemented would be reflected in the lower stroke
recurrence rate, as suggested by prior studies that have found
that every reduction of 1 mm Hg of BP was associated with a
4% reduction in stroke recurrence.19 Although there may be
several barriers to implementing these new guidelines, finan-
cial burden is arguably one of the most important hurdles to
putting these guidelines into practice. Subsequent simulation
analyses from the SPRINT do suggest that intensive BP control
would be cost-effective in the mid- and long-term.25 Subse-
quent evaluations of the level of adherence to the new
guidelines among stroke survivors as well as short- and long-
term economic cost analyses are needed.

 diagnosis ofstroke specifically conductedbyNHANES, the useof
self-report instroke epidemiology studies,including in the United
States, has been shown to have a sensitivity and specificity
ranging from 78% to 96% and 96% to 98%, respectively.26–29
Furthermore, we were not able to provide estimates by stroke
subtypes.The current study relies onBP obtainedat a single visit,
unlike the recommended average of multiple BP measurements
by the JNC7 and ACC/AHA guidelines. Despite these potential
limitations, our studyhas major strengths, including the rigorous,
validated, standardized, and consistent methods for collecting
data in NHANES each year and nationwide reach.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our findings suggest that implementing the
ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines will result in significant
increase in the proportion of stroke survivors with hyperten-
sion, recommended pharmacological treatment, and above BP
target. Our results call for preemptive actions to successfully
implement the new guidelines in stroke survivors.
