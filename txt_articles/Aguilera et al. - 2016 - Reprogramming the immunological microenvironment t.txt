Increasing evidence suggests that ionizing radiation therapy (RT) in combination with
checkpoint immunotherapy is highly effective in treating a subset of cancers. To better
understand the limited responses to this combination we analysed the genetic, micro-
environmental, and immune factors in tumours derived from a transgenic breast cancer
model. We identified two tumours with similar growth characteristics but different RT
responses primarily due to an antitumour immune response. The combination of RT and
checkpoint immunotherapy resulted in cures in the responsive but not the unresponsive
tumours. Profiling the tumours revealed that the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase is over-
expressed in the unresponsive tumours, and Axl knockout resulted in slower growth and
increased radiosensitivity. These changes were associated with a CD8 þ T-cell response,
which was improved in combination with checkpoint immunotherapy. These results suggest a
novel role for Axl in suppressing antigen presentation through MHCI, and enhancing cytokine
release, which promotes a suppressive myeloid microenvironment.

 I
n recent years, cancer immunotherapy has demonstrated
clinical benefit of targeting immune checkpoints that modulate
immune-mediated tumour clearance. CTLA-4 and PD-1 are
two negative regulatory immune checkpoints that modulate the
T-cell response to antigens presented through the T-cell receptor
and blocking antibodies (Ab) to immune checkpoints have led to
multiple FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approvals since
2011 (ref. 1). Although single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitor
therapy responses are limited to 10–30% of patients, responses
can be dramatic in patients with metastatic disease, leading to
extended survival2–5. Interest in combining radiation therapy
(RT) with immune checkpoint therapy heightened after a case
report by Postow et al.6 indicating that RT to one lesion triggered
a systemic response in a melanoma patient who had previously
progressed on the CTLA-4 Ab Ipilimumab. Similar observations
have been published for a small number of patients, and both
clinical and preclinical data have validated potential benefits for
the combination of RT with CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade7–11.
It is important to understand why many patients do not respond
to checkpoint immunotherapy or its combination with RT. Factors
that may impact efficacy of the combination include limited antigen
presentation by tumour cells or antigen-presenting cells, or a
tumour-promoting microenvironment that suppresses antitumour
immune responses. Many preclinical models evaluating RT and
immunotherapy have focused on immunogenic model antigens,
thus bypassing these factors12,13. It is known that RT can enhance
antigen
presentation
by
increasing
major
histocompatibility
complex class 1 (MHCI), but responses can be diminished
through
increased
PD-L1
expression,
thereby
providing
a
rationale for combination therapy9,14,15. However, there is a need
to identify factors that suppress the immune response, rendering
RT or its combination with immune checkpoint therapy ineffective.
For example, Stefani et al. recently identified the b-catenin
signalling pathway that suppresses licensing of dendritic cells
through chemokines in melanoma, and we propose that this
pathway may also suppress responses to radiation and combination
checkpoint therapy16. Alternatively, targeted therapies have been
shown
to
have
independent
effects
on
the
immunological
compartment.
For
example,
MET
oncogene
inhibition
can
promote tumour progression through inhibition of antitumour
neutrophils, and PI3 kinase inhibitors can block myeloid suppressor
cells, thus enhancing antitumour responses17,18. However, little is
known about the cellular and microenvironmental factors that
influence the immune stimulatory effects of RT.
In this study, we sought to identify tumour cell derived factors
that suppress immunological responses and limit the RT response
and its combination with checkpoint immunotherapy. Although
some tumours are known to be more radio-responsive than
others, comparisons have limited utility due to genetic diversity
between different tumour types. Therefore, we evaluated immune
responses after RT using clonal tumours derived from the same
parental transgenic mouse model, which would allow compar-
isons between tumours in a syngeneic setting. We focused on two
tumour clones with unique immune responses after RT. These
clones represent differences in responses often found in tumours
from human patients. When evaluating differences between the
tumours, we identified Axl, a TAM (Tyro3/Axl/Mer) family
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), to be highly expressed in the
radioresistant tumour but not in the responsive tumour. Genetic
deletion of Axl in the resistant tumours indicated that loss of Axl
enhanced antigen presentation, altered cytokine secretion, and
restored radiosensitivity that is largely immunologically mediated.
Axl has gained much attention as it has been shown to be a key
mediator of invasion and metastasis, is induced by HIF1-a
and hypoxia, and can promote drug resistance when over-
expressed19–21. In addition, Hugo et al.22 recently reported that
Axl is a key gene expressed in patients unresponsive to PD-1
immunotherapy, which provides timely clinical relevance of our
novel findings. Here we describe a previously unrecognized role
for Axl in immune resistance that licenses an antitumour
immune response when genetically targeted on the tumour cell.
This antitumour response sensitizes tumours to RT and probably
additional anticancer therapies.
Results
Differential radiosensitivity is not due to classic factors. We
developed a model of immunological heterogeneity in an isogenic
background to study tumour-derived factors that influence
immune mediated antitumour responses. Mammary tumour cell
lines from the transgenic model of the mouse mammary tumour
virus promoter driving the polyoma middle T antigen (MMTV-
PyMT) in a C57Bl/6 background that efficiently form orthotopic
tumours in vivo were used to evaluate radiobiological responses.
The Py8119 clone was resistant to 12 and 20 Gy of radiation,
whereas the Py117 clone was sensitive to these same doses
(Fig. 1a). Both clones had similar radiosensitivity in cell culture as
detected by clonogenic survival (Fig. 1b), indicating that tumour
cell autonomous factors are not responsible for the differences in
radiosensitivity. To determine if extrinsic factors of vasculariza-
tion and hypoxia influenced the radiation response, we harvested
tumours 90 min after injection of the hypoxia marker, pimoni-
dazole (PIMO). Sections were stained with a MECA-32 antibody
and anti-PIMO antibody to evaluate microvessel density and
hypoxia, respectively. There were no significant differences
between the Py117 and Py8119 tumours (Fig. 1c,d).
The Py117 and Py8119 cells were then evaluated for MHCI and
PD-L1 surface expression to test the hypothesis that tumour cell
immune mediated factors could be responsible for the differences
in the radiation response. Although MHCI and PD-L1 were both
enhanced by interferon gamma (IFN-g), they have competing
roles as MHCI promotes antigen-specific effector responses, while
PD-L1 renders tumour cells resistant to T-cell effector functions.
The Py117 cells had higher MHCI expression at baseline and after
IFN-g compared with Py8119 cells. In contrast, PD-L1 expression
was low on both cell lines and was induced after radiation or IFN-
g treatment. IFN-g mediated PD-L1 induction in both cell lines
indicates that the adaptive immune resistance pathway is intact
(Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 1).
Differential radiosensitivity is due to an immune response. To
evaluate differences in the immune response between Py117 and
Py8119 cells, tumours were treated with or without 12 Gy of RT,
and harvested after 10 days. Immunohistochemistry of CD3
revealed substantial numbers of T-cells in the untreated Py117
tumours that increased after RT. In contrast, there were few
T-cells with or without RT in the Py8119 tumours (Fig. 2a).
To quantify T-cell infiltrates and leukocyte populations, tumours
were dissociated and analysed by flow cytometry. The percentage
of CD45 þ infiltrating leukocytes was similar in both untreated
tumours, but increased from 27 to 78% 10 days after radiation in
the Py117 tumours (Fig. 2b,c). The CD8 þ T-cell subset increased
from 2.1 to 9.3% of live cells. In addition, there were more CD4 þ
T-cells in Py117 compared with Py8119 tumours that did not
change after radiation. There was almost a complete loss of
immature myeloid cells often described as myeloid-derived
suppressor cells or PMN-MDSCs with high GR1 expression
(iMCs,
CD45 þCD11b þGR1hi)23
and
lower
proportion
of
macrophages (Macs, CD45 þCD11b þF4/80 þ) that increased in
Py117 tumours after radiation. In contrast, there was little change
in these cell populations in the radioresistant Py8119 tumours
(Fig. 2d–g, gating Supplementary Fig. 2).

 To determine if the radiation response is dependent upon the
immune system, tumours were implanted into athymic nude mice
that lack functional T-cells. Py117 tumours grew faster in nude
mice and were significantly less radiosensitive, confirming much
of the sensitivity is due to a T-cell mediated immune response.
The Py8119 tumours were equally radioresistant whether in a
wild-type or immunodeficient host (Fig. 2h).
Given differences of MHCI and PD-L1 expression in cells in
tissue culture, we investigated their levels on dissociated CD45 �
tumour cells by flow cytometry. We found that MHCI was not
significantly increased after radiation but was expressed at 10-fold
greater levels in Py117 tumours than Py8119 tumours (Fig. 2i).
Furthermore, a robust antitumour immune response in Py117
tumours after radiation was supported by increased PD-L1
expression, suggesting adaptive immune resistance. Unchanged
levels of PD-L1 in Py8119 tumours after radiation support the
lack of an interferon based immune response (Fig. 2j).
Combination therapy is effective in radiosensitive tumours.
With the finding of increased CD8 þ T-cells, MHCI expression,
and induction of PD-L1 after radiation in Py117 tumours we
hypothesized that the combination of RT and PD-1 blockade would
be highly effective in Py117 tumours, and be of little benefit in the
Py8119 tumours. Mice were treated with 12Gy of RT, Ab admin-
istration began on that day, and Ab was injected every 4 days for 24
days. Appropriate controls were included in the experimental
scheme (Fig. 3a). Inhibition of PD-1 alone had little effect on Py117
tumours, but the combination of anti-PD-1 and RT led to a greater
antitumour response, with 25% of the mice having no detectable
tumour 80 days after treatment. To enhance T-cell priming and/or
blocking regulatory T-cells (Tregs), a single dose of CTLA-4 Ab was
given 3 days before the first RT and anti-PD-1 treatment, which led
to a complete response in 75% of Py117 tumours. The effect of a
single dose of CTLA-4 and its combination with radiation was
similar to the PD-1 combination but the CTLA-4 and PD-1 com-
bination resulted in more cures. The Py8119 tumours did not
respond to a single agent or combination therapies (Fig. 3a). The
Py117 tumour curves were modelled using a repeated measures
model revealing a significant difference between 12Gy þ isotype
versus 12Gyþ PD-1 Ab and 12Gy þ PD-1 Ab þ CTLA-4 Ab with

Figure 1 | PyMT syngeneic tumours have different radiosensitivity that is not due to classic factors. (a) Orthotopic implantation reveals that Py117
tumours are more radiosensitive than Py8119 tumours and when untreated tumours have a similar growth rate (n ¼ 4–5 each group). (b) Clonogenic
survival to evaluate intrinsic factors of radioresistance in culture showed no significant differences between the two tumour clones. (c) Blood vessel density
was determined with MECA-32 staining showing no significant difference between two tumours (three mice, three fields per tumour; scale bar, 100 mm).
(d) Levels of hypoxia are similar on the day radiation would be given as determined by pimonidazole immunohistochemistry (5–6 mice each; scale bar,
200 mm). (e) Immunological indicators, MHCI (H-2Kb) and PD-L1 were evaluated by flow cytometry. There was greater MHCI expression on the Py117
cells that was induced to a greater degree by 10 Gy or IFN-g compared with Py8119 cells. PD-L1 was similar in the untreated cells but had greater induction
by radiation in Py8119 cells whereas IFN-g stimulated Py117 cells to a greater extent. All error bars, mean and s.d.

 P¼ 0.002 and 0.0004, respectively (Fig. 3b). The antitumour
response of combination treatment lead to increased survival of
mice with Py117 tumours but not mice with Py8119 tumours
(Fig. 3c). Py117 mice were then treated with depleting antibodies
for CD8 þ, CD4þ and NK cells to determine the relative impor-
tance of each cell type. We found that CD8þ depletion resulted in a
diminished radiation response, depletion of NK cells had no effect,
and
depletion

activity
(Supplementary Fig. 3). This confirms the importance of CD8þ
effector T-cells. Despite low number of CD4þ T-cells, if they are
Tregs, they may blunt the antitumour response, explaining the added
benefit of a single CTLA-4 dose24.

 In preclinical studies of immunogenic tumour models, it is
common to rechallenge cured mice and look at the response to an
unirradiated contralateral tumour suggesting lasting immunity
and ‘abscopal’ responses12,25. To test if mice that had a complete
response to combination therapy have lasting immunity, six out
of the eight Py117 mice cured with 12 Gy þ PD-1 Ab þ CTLA-4
Ab were rechallenged in the contralateral fat pad. It was clear that
all tumours were growing after 8 days, so PD-1 Ab was initiated.
Though there was no rejection of the tumours, initiating PD-1 Ab
was sufficient to slow tumour growth compared with naive mice
treated with PD-1 Ab alone (Fig. 3d). To test for ‘abscopal’
responses against a contralateral tumour, two tumours were
implanted, one tumour received RT and the other tumour was
monitored for growth delay. Mice were treated with 12 Gy or
20 Gy in a single fraction with PD-1 Ab or 20 Gy þ PD-1 þ a
single dose of CTLA-4 Ab 3 days before radiation. The group
with a significant contralateral tumour response compared to the
RT and PD-1 Ab treated mice was the combination of

Therefore, Py117 tumours are responsive to combination therapy,
but the response is not sufficient for complete eradication after
rechallenge or for a complete response to an unirradiated
contralateral tumour. These data suggest that radiation plays a
key role in licensing an immune response that can be enhanced
with checkpoint blockade, but is not sufficient for a complete
long-term antitumour immune response, which may be due to
the absence of a dominant tumour antigen. Radiation does not
reverse T-cell infiltration in the Py8119 tumours, suggesting a
tumour cell intrinsic mechanism of T-cell exclusion may play an
important role.
Many of the models which describe robust antitumour
immune responses, efficient abscopal responses, and resistance
to rechallenge, introduce model antigens such as HA, OVA, or
SIY peptides12,13. We did not perform genetic manipulation of
the cells, but we performed whole exome sequencing of the Py117
and Py8119 cells to ensure there was no dramatic difference in
mutation burden. Focusing on mutations unique to each cell line,
we found that the Py117 cells contained 83 unique mutations
resulting in stop-gain, frameshift or nonsynonymous variants
whereas the Py8119 cells contained 66 (Supplementary Data 1).
These data suggests that differences in mutation burden between
the two cell lines are unlikely to explain the difference in the
immune response we observed. Kim et al. recently sequenced the
poorly immunogenic syngeneic 4T1 breast cancer cell line that
contained 47 mutations and the moderately immunogenic CT26
colorectal cancer cell line that contained 683 mutations and
despite difference in mapped epitopes on MHCI there was little
difference in the immune response generated. They found that
pharmacological treatment with epigenetic modulators did not
impact antigen presentation as much as they had effects on
suppressive
myeloid
cells,
despite
a
10-fold
difference
in
mutations between the models17. We hypothesize that the ten-
fold difference in MHCI expression (Fig. 2i) or other factors are
more likely to impact the immune response than the mutational
burden.
Axl impacts the immune response and tumour growth. To
determine differences in signalling pathways between the tumour
clones, we used reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA). The analysis
resulted in a number of differences, supporting an independent
clonal evolution of the two cell lines as expected. The Py8119
tumour cells had clear differences in epithelial mesenchymal
transition (EMT) -related proteins including reduced E-Cadherin,
phospho b-catenin, and cytokeratin, and increased N-Cadherin
and phospho NF-kB (Fig. 4a). This observation is consistent with
differences in cell invasion in three-dimensional (3D) culture in
Fig. 4b. We found that phospho b-catenin is reduced in Py8119
compared with Py117 cells, suggesting it is not the key mediator
of immune suppression in this model as has been reported in
melanoma16.
Consistent with changes in the EMT phenotype and cell
morphology, the RTK Axl was elevated on Py8119 compared with
Py117 cells. Western blot and cell surface staining by flow
cytometry confirmed elevated expression in the resistant Py8119
cells compared with the Py117 cells, and that the expression of
Axl did not change with radiation (Fig. 4c). We hypothesized that
Axl has a role in immune resistance given its role in EMT, the
observation that Axl is differentially expressed between the two
tumour cell lines, and how it could impact myeloid cells in
suppressing an anti-tumour immune response if there was
an increase in subsequent Gas6 expression26–28. To better
understand the immunological role of Axl, the CRISPR/Cas9
technology was used to knockout Axl in Py8119 cells. Figure 4d
shows untreated and Supplementary Fig. 4A shows IFN-g treated
cells changes in Axl expression by flow cytometry in wild-type
Py8119 cells, vector control Py8119 cells, Py117 cells and five
Py8119 Axl CRISPR tumour cell clones (Axl Cr#1–5). Western
blot analysis confirmed elevated expression of Axl protein in
Py8119 cells as well as higher levels of Tyr702 phosphorylation.
In contrast, complete knockout of Axl in the CRISPR clones
resulted in undetectable levels of Axl protein and Tyr702
phosphorylation (Fig. 4e).
The Axl CRISPR knockout Py8119 cells showed a loss of
invasive capacity in 3D culture (Fig. 4b and Supplementary
Fig. 4B) but did not show an impact on proliferation rate in tissue
culture (Fig. 4f). There was no difference in in vitro radio-
sensitivity based upon clonogenic survival of the knockout clones
when compared with parental cells from Fig. 1b (Fig. 4g). When
the CRISPR cells were implanted into naive C57Bl/6 mice, there
was slower tumour growth in three clones and pooled clones
compared with CRISPR control and parental Py8119 tumours
(Fig. 4h). Lastly, we found that Axl knockout impacts radio-
sensitivity in the three different Axl knockout clonal tumours in
the context of the tumour microenvironment and immune system
but not in Py8119 vector control orthotopic tumours (Fig. 4i).
Axl suppresses MHCI and enhances cytokine secretion. Given
low MHCI levels in Py8119 cells compared with Py117 discussed
in Fig. 1, we hypothesized that Axl suppresses MHCI expression.
Rothlin
et
al.26
observed
increased
MHCI
expression
in
myeloid cells of TAM triple knockout mice, suggesting an
association. We found that MHCI surface expression was
increased in Axl knockout clones Axl Cr #1 and #2 compared
with control Py8119 cells (Fig. 4j and Supplementary Fig. 5A).
We investigated the MHC transcriptional co-activator CIITA that
can be influenced by EGFR inhibition but found no enhancement
of CIITA transcription, although levels were higher in Py117
cells29 (Supplementary Fig. 5B). We found increased STAT1
protein and phosphorylation in Py8119 Axl CRISPR cells,
a known mediator of IFN-g and MHCI expression, which
suggests that Axl directly or indirectly suppresses STAT1
(Supplementary Fig. 5C). However, Axl knockout cells did not
result in an increase in PD-L1 expression in the absence of IFN-g
stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 5D).
We also tested the hypothesis that NF-kB targets in the tumour
cells may be differentially activated given the elevated activity
observed in the RPPA. Increased protein levels of NF-kB p65
were
found
in
wild-type
compared
with
knockout
cells.
NF-kB-p65 was targeted with siRNA, which resulted in decreased
IL-6 transcription compared with Py8119 vector control cells.
MHCI levels were not affected in NF-kB siRNA cells, indicating
that its suppression by Axl is not NF-kB-dependent (Fig. 4k).
Elevated levels of Axl may not only suppress MHCI but could
promote myeloid cells such as macrophages through secretion of
soluble factors. The Luminex multiplex cytokine and chemokine
assay was performed on conditioned media from vector control
Py8119 cells, two Py8119 Axl Cr clones, and wild-type Py117
cells, revealing a number of factors significantly decreased in Axl
knockout and Py117 cells. The factors identified fall into three
categories: myeloid supporting cytokines (CSF1, CSF2 and CSF3)
(Fig. 4l); macrophage recruiting chemokine’s (CCL3, CCL4 and
CCL5) (Fig. 4m), and NF-kB target cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a and
IL-1a) (Fig. 4n).
These
findings
suggest
that
the
Py8119
cells
amplify
TAM signalling through Gas6 production, enhanced NF-kB
inflammatory response including cytokine targets, may recruit
myeloid cells through cytokine and chemokine secretion, and
suppress antigen presentation through MHCI. Taken together,

Figure 4 | Axl impacts key immunosuppresive immunological factors in tumour cells. (a) The Py8119 cells have an EMT pattern on RPPA and (b) are
more invasive than Py117 cells in 3D culture (scale bar, 50 mm). (c) There was elevated Axl compared with Py117 cells with or without 10 Gy of radiation on
western blot (left), and flow cytometry (right). (d) CRISPR knockout of Axl (Py8119 Axl Cr#1/ #2) was confirmed by flow cytometry and loss of Axl

(f) There was no difference in proliferation between wild-type and Axl Cr clones (XTT assay, representative experiment, in triplicate) and (g) clonogenic

each, RT: Py8119 ¼ day 9, Axl Cr#1–3 ¼ day 14, and Axl Cr Pool ¼ day 19). (j) MHCI surface expression was increased in Axl Cr #1 cells and further induced

 we hypothesized that Axl is a key suppressor of an anti-tumour
immune response. Though Axl has been known to mediate
therapeutic resistance, the recent study by Hugo et al.22 was the
first to suggest a role in resistance to immunotherapy. To evaluate
if our findings correlate with gene expression in human cancer,
we investigated the cancer genome atlas (TCGA)30. In the breast
cancer data set of 1,215 patients, Axl significantly correlates with
many of the secreted factors identified on Luminex in addition to
Axl associated genes Gas6 and Mer. We generated a gene
signature (PyMT Signature) that correlated well with Axl
expression (Pearson r value of 0.52). Because Axl is important
in EMT, we generated an EMT signature adapted from Byers
et al.31 and found a significant relationship to Axl expression and
our PyMT signature, suggesting that the factors secreted in the
presence of Axl signalling are EMT related (Fig. 4o). We then
checked the PyMT signature against Axl expression in the
PanCancer data set of 9,755 patients, subdivided the different
disease sites, and evaluated the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia of
967 human cancer cell lines, and found significant correlations
(Supplementary Fig. 6).
Axl suppresses the antitumour immune responses. We aimed to
evaluate the impact of Axl knockout tumours on the immuno-
logical microenvironment to determine if loss of Axl licenses an
antitumour immune response. Py8119 Axl knockout clones were
injected into nude mice and irradiated when tumours were
75–125 mm3 to determine if immunodeficiency impacts radiation
response. Tumours derived from both Axl Cr#1 and 2 knockout
cells had reduced response to radiation when implanted in nude
mice compared with wild-type mice, with the time to doubling
volume of 13 days in nude mice versus 25 days in wild-type mice
(Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 7). Py8119 Axl Cr#1 or pooled
knockout tumours from untreated or irradiated groups were
dissociated 10 days after treatment and compared with the
parental Py8119 tumours. The Axl knockout tumours had a
greater proportion of CD45 þ infiltrates compared with parental
tumours without irradiation, which increased after radiation,
supporting that loss of Axl results in a greater inflammatory
phenotype (Fig. 5b). Macrophage infiltration was greater in Axl
knockout tumours at baseline given a higher proportion of
CD45 þ cells. However, the proportion of macrophages in Axl
knockout
tumours
significantly
decreased
after
radiation
compared with an increase in parental tumours (Fig. 5c). Thus
the loss of Axl results in decreased levels of macrophages in
response to radiation and suggests an important role of Axl in the
recruitment of macrophages after radiation, which supports the
cytokine and chemokine signalling hypothesis.
After finding increased immune infiltrates in Axl knockout
tumours, we hypothesized that the loss of Axl elicits a T-cell
mediated immune response through enhanced tumour cell and
myeloid cell antigen presentation. As observed in tissue culture,
the tumour-derived CD45 � cells exhibited increased surface
expression of MHCI 50–100 fold after the knockout of Axl with
and without radiation (Fig. 5d). With greater antigen presentation
and CD45 þ infiltrates, we evaluated the proportion of CD11b þ
antigen presenting myeloid cells that express CD11c and MHCII,
often
considered
myeloid
dendritic
cells
(mDCs:
CD45 þ
CD11b þCD11c þMHCII þ)32. We found greater proportion of
mDCs in the Axl knockout tumours (Fig. 5e and Supplementary
Fig. 8). However, after radiation the mDCs are relatively
decreased perhaps due to T-cell influx, diminished myeloid cell
recruitment, and a robust Treg response that can suppress mDCs
and promote M2-like macrophages33,34.
In addition to antigen presentation and mDC infiltrates there
was also an increase in CD8 þ
T-cells without treatment
compared with wild-type tumours, and T-cell infiltrates increased
even more after radiation. The fold increases in proportion of
CD8 þ cells in the Py8119 Axl Cr#1 and Py8119 pool compared
with wild-type tumours were 4.9 and 20.6 without RT and 4.5 and
40.7 after RT (Fig. 5f). The CD8 þ T-cells had a high proportion
of the Ki-67 proliferation marker in all groups (Fig. 5g). Upon
stimulation, the CD8 þ T-cells produced TNF-a and IFN-g
supporting a functional phenotype rather than exhausted T-cell
phenotype (Fig. 5h, Supplementary Fig. 9A,B). After initial
regression, tumour progression occurred, suggesting that either
exhaustion or adaptive immune resistance occurs despite an
antitumour response. The highest proportion of PD-1 þ cells was
observed in the wild-type untreated tumours and was lower after
radiation and in Axl knockout tumours. These data support that a
significant proportion of T-cells may become functionally inactive
upon
engagement
with
the PD-L1
ligand
(Supplementary
Fig. 10A).
We next evaluated the impact of Axl on CD4 þ T-cells to
determine if these cells support a TH-1 antitumour phenotype or
whether they augment the antitumour response through Treg
recruitment. Surprisingly, CD4 þ cells were at a low abundance in
wild-type Py8119 tumours and further decreased 10 days after
radiation. The number of CD4 þ cells was initially higher then
increased after radiation in the Axl Cr#1 tumours. In comparison,
CD4 þ cells were high with or without radiation in the responsive
pooled knockout tumours (Fig. 5i). The proportion of CD4 þ
cells that secrete TNF-a and IFN-g upon stimulation decreased
after radiation in both tumours suggesting a decreased TH-1
response (Fig. 5k and Supplementary Fig. 9C). The abundance of
FoxP3 þ Treg cells increased in wild-type tumours after radiation.
Alternatively, there was no relative increase in Tregs in knockout
tumours. Tregs were abundant after radiation but more so in Axl
Cr#1 compared with the pooled tumours given the increased
CD4 þ infiltrates (Fig. 5l). The increase in FoxP3 þ Tregs in the
Axl knockout tumours suggests an adaptive immune resistance
mechanism after radiation that is greater in the less responsive
Axl Cr#1 tumours compared with the pooled Axl CRISPR
tumours. This mechanism may explain why tumours recur rather
than resolve despite the robust CD8 þ T-cell response. Evaluation
of PD-L1 levels in CD45 � tumour cells indicated the PD-1/PD-
L1 pathway may also be a second mechanism of adaptive
resistance (Fig. 5m). Overall the pooled Axl CRISPR tumours had
the slowest growth and were the most sensitive to radiation,
suggesting a greater immune response than the single Axl Cr #1
clone, which could be explained by greater CD45 þ cells, mDCs,
CD8 þ cells, CD4 þ cells and relatively fewer Tregs. Furthermore,
improved overall antitumour T-cell response in the pooled Axl
CRISPR tumours is also supported by an enhanced CD8 þ to
Treg ratio (Supplementary Fig. 10B).
Because
of
elevated
Tregs
and
PD-L1
expression,
we
hypothesized that targeting Tregs with CTLA-4 and PD-L1 with
a PD-1 blocking antibody would lead to a greater antitumour
immune response after radiation. PD-1 antibody alone had little
effect on tumour growth, and the combination of PD-1 Ab
and 20 Gy was no better than radiation alone. However, the
combination of CTLA-4 Ab, PD-1 Ab, and radiation resulted in a
greater response than 20 Gy and 20 Gy þ PD-1 Ab (Fig. 5n).
There was little to no response to this combination therapy in
wild-type Py8119 tumours (Supplementary Fig. 11).
Discussion
With the expanding role of immune checkpoint therapies and
their clinical impact, much attention has been focused on the
immune system and its potential to eradicate cancer. However,
there is a need to understand how tumours evade an immune

 response, often rendering checkpoint therapies ineffective. In this
study, we used tumour clones from a transgenic mouse model to
discover factors that contribute to immune resistance after
radiation. Figure 6 depicts our current understanding of how
tumour Axl impacts the immune response. Genetic deletion of
Axl in the resistant tumour cells leads to an increase in MHCI
and myeloid promoting cytokines. Additionally, these key
molecular findings correlate with Axl expression in the TCGA
breast cancer data set, and our molecular signature correlates with
Axl and an EMT gene signature. In this model system, loss of Axl

 allows the development of antitumour immune response where it
was previously suppressed. RT results in greater CD45 þ, mDC,
CD8 þ cells, but decreased macrophage infiltration. The immune
response generated by loss of Axl leads to adaptive immune
resistance through PD-L1 expression and Treg infiltration and
tumours became sensitive to checkpoint immunotherapy when
they were previously resistant.
Our findings provide complementary insight to Hugo et al.,
who showed that Axl and other EMT genes are correlated with
resistance to PD-1 immunotherapy in melanoma patients22.
We propose that in some tumours anti-Axl therapy will enhance
antitumour
immune
responses
to
overcome
therapeutic
resistance, while at the same time decrease invasion, and
metastasis. Therefore, RT or other conventional therapies may
optimally combine with Axl inhibition in order generate an
immune response that may otherwise be suppressed.
In recent years, Axl has been identified as a therapeutic target
for its role in cancer progression. Multiple therapeutics directed
against Axl are in development including kinase inhibitors,
soluble
receptors,
and
antibodies35–38.
There
is
growing
recognition that TAM family RTKs, including Axl and Mer
play important roles not only in invasion and metastasis
and therapeutic resistance but also in the generation of an
anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive environment. Axl has
suppressive effects through the inhibition of dendritic cell
activation and along with Mer can decrease NK cell antitumour
activity resulting in increased metastasis26,39,40. In addition,
Mer is important in efferocytosis or clearance of dead cells by

Figure 6 | Loss of Axl enables licensing an antitumour immune response after RT. With high expression of Axl, there is low MHCI expression and tumour
cells release myeloid promoting cytokines and chemokines. With the loss of Axl, MHCI expression increases and cytokine signaling is diminished leading to an
immune response with increased CD11cþ and MHCII þ antigen presenting cells (mDC) and T-cells. The addition of RT licenses a robust antitumour
immune response with decreased macrophages (Mac), increased proportion of antigen presenting cells, and a greater recruitment of CD4þ and CD8þ T-cells.
Figure 5 | Adaptive immune response contributes to Axl mediated radiosensitivity. (a) The radiation response of Py8119 Axl Cr#1 to 20 Gy is decreased
in immunodeficient nude mice (RTat 12–14 days, **P ¼ 0.0036, five mice each). (b) There was an increased proportion of infiltrating CD45 þ leukocytes in
Axl Cr#1 and pooled tumours and in all tumours 10 days after 20 Gy. (c) The proportion of CD45 þCD11b þF4/80 þ macrophages increased after radiation
in Py8119 tumours but was higher initially then decreased in Axl Cr#1 tumours. (d) MHCI expression was greater in Axl knockout CD45 � tumour cells

in Axl deficient tumours with and without radiation. (f) There were greater infiltrating CD8 þ T-cells in Axl knockout tumours that increased after radiation.
(g) The CD8 þ cells had an elevated proportion of Ki-67 þ cells in wild-type and Axl Cr#1 tumours. (h) The CD8 þ T-cells were isolated and stimulated
revealing a significant proportion of cells with capacity to secrete TNF-a and IFN-g. (i) CD4 þ T-cell infiltrates decreased after radiation in wild-type

 phagocytosis, suppression of macrophage cytokine responses,
promoting an M2 macrophage phenotype, promoting B-cell
tolerance, and T-cell mediated suppression of antigen-presenting
cells21.
MHCI expression was one of the biggest differences between
the PyMT tumour cell clones. Even with IFN-g stimulation,
MHCI levels could not be restored in Py8119 cells to the levels
observed in the Py117 cells (Fig. 1e). The fact that invading cells
with an EMT phenotype like Py8119 need to escape immune
surveillance, and kinases such as EGFR have been implicated in
suppressing MHCI, we hypothesized that Axl may suppress
MHCI29. CRISPR knockouts of Axl resulted in an increase in
MHCI that could be induced to levels higher than IFN-g
stimulated parental cells (Fig. 4k). The effects impact both STAT1
translation and phosphorylation. Therefore, Axl seems to play a
role in regulating antigen presentation and studies are ongoing to
better understand this observation.
The role of NF-kB activation and induction of inflammatory
cytokines likely contributes to a tumour promoting microenvir-
onment. Both TNF-a and IL-6 have been previously reported to
be associated with TAM RTK signalling41,42. Here we found that
both TNF-a and IL-6 production by tumour cells is diminished
upon Axl knockout. In addition, we found a significant decrease
in CSF1, CSF2, CSF3, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 and IL1-a in Axl
knockout cells. These cytokines and chemokines each play a
role in supporting myeloid cell infiltration in the tumour
microenvironment and may explain high levels of macrophages
that increase after radiation. In Axl knockout tumours, the
macrophages decreased after radiation despite an absolute
increase in leukocytes before therapy (Fig. 5b). In addition,
there was an increase in the number of myeloid dendritic cells
that may prime T-cells and in irradiated tumours result in T-cell
infiltration and immune dependent radiosensitivity.
This study reinforces the concept that immune checkpoint
therapies are not effective unless an antitumour immune response
is generated. The Py117 tumour cells have high levels of MHCI
expression and infiltrating T-cells at baseline, but established
Py117 tumours are not responsive to PD-1 therapy alone. This
unresponsiveness may be due to the lack of dominant antigens to
activate a robust T-cell response. We hypothesize that radiation
serves as a catalyst to remove suppressive factors, release tumour
antigens, and kill tumour cells enabling an adaptive immune
response. In this setting, anti-PD1 therapy provides additional
benefit to block adaptive resistance. In the Axl expressing Py8119
tumours, we observed a limited initial immune response, which
was not improved by radiation, thereby making combination with
checkpoint therapy ineffective. Therefore, Axl directed therapy in
Axl expressing tumours could reprogram resistant tumours when
combined with radiation or chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
These findings have significant clinical implications, and it will be
important to more completely elucidate the major effects of Axl
inhibition in various contexts as we begin to propose anti-Axl
therapy in combination with immunotherapies.
Methods
PyMT tumour cell lines. Spontaneous tumours from the transgenic MMTV-
PyMT mice congenic in the C57Bl/6 background43 were enzymatically digested for
two to three hours at 37 �C in 1 mg ml � 1 type 2 collagenase (Worthington
Biochemical Corp.), 2 mg ml � 1 soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich),
1 mg ml � 1 BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, MO), 50 mg ml � 1 gentamicin (Life Technologies)
in F12K media (Mediatech Inc.). The suspension was neutralized in serum
containing media and filtered through 70 mm mesh, centrifuged and resuspended in
complete F12K media containing 5% fetal clone II (Hyclone), MITO (1:1,000
dilution, BD Biosciences), 50 mg ml � 1 gentamicin and 2.5 mg ml � 1 amphotericin B
as previously described44. The cells were passaged for approximately five passages
and cloned by limiting dilution. Clonal cell lines were maintained in complete
F12K media. There was no other selection difference during the derivation of
Py8119 and Py117 cells such as selection of drug resistant clones. All experiments
were performed with Py8119 and Py117 clones between passage numbers 15–25.
Cells were confirmed to be mycoplasma free.
For tissue culture experiments cells were treated as described in the text. For
radiation and clonogenic survival cells were irradiated and then plated accordingly
such as limiting dilutions for colony formation. For cells plated for 3D culture,
2,500 cells were plated in 2 mg ml � 1 low growth factor matrigel (Corning) in
96-well plates after a base coat was established. Media was changed daily and cell
clusters were imaged by phase contrast at 4 days. For syngeneic orthotopic
implants 1 � 106 tumour cells were injected into the mammary fat pad in
2 mg ml � 1 matrigel (Corning). For XTT assay cells were plated at 2–5,000 cells per
well in 96-well plate and treated in triplicate groups of cells at 24, 49, 72 and 96
days after plating. Cells were analysed on a plate reader using absorbance based off
of XTT assay recommendations.
Tumour treatments. RT of tumours was typically initiated between 75 and
125 mm3 on day 9–14 after implantation (the pooled CRISPR tumours were treated
on day 19 due to slow growth). Each cell line and model were treated on the same
day, however, the nude and C57Bl/6 comparison growth curves of the Axl Cr#1
tumours were adjusted to the date RT was administered while in the target size
range given the discrepancy in growth rate. Volume measurements were obtained
every 2–4 days after initiation of treatment using L � L � W/2. RT was performed
using a 225 kVp cabinet X-ray irradiator filtered with 0.5 mm Cu (IC-250, Kimtron
Inc., CT) and anaesthetised animals were shielded with a 3.2 mm lead shield with a
15 � 20 mm aperture. CTLA-4 Ab (9D9, Bio-X-Cell) treatment using 200 mg IP
injection was administered 3 days before the day of RT or as described in the text
and then every 4 days � 5 in the combination therapy Axl knockout tumour
experiment. PD-1 Ab (RMP1-14, Bio-X-Cell) treatment with 200 mg IP was initi-
ated on day of radiation and administered every 4 days � 5–6 (five doses given if
the tumour diameter was near 17.5 mm). For blocking antibody experiments aCD8
Ab (2.43, Bio-X-Cell), aCD4 (GK1.5, Bio-X-Cell), aNK1.1 (PK136) or Rat IgG2a
isotype Ab were injected IP at 500 mg per injection 1 day before radiation (day 13)
then every 5 days � 4 total. For the Axl knockout radiation and immunotherapy
experiments radiation was performed 14 days after implantation and CTLA-4 was
injected IP 3 days before radiation then injected with PD-1 at the time of radiation
and every 4 days � 5. All animal procedures were approved by the administrative
panel on laboratory animal care.
Immunohistochemistry. Tumour-bearing mice were injected with 15 mg of
Pimonidazole (Pimo, Hypoxyprobe-1 Omni Kit, 1:150, PAb2627AP, Hypoxyprobe
Inc., MA) IP 90 min before harvest on the day radiation would be given. Tumours
were removed, fixed in 10% formalin buffered saline and embedded in paraffin for
histology and IHC. Tumour sections were dewaxed, citric acid antigen retrieval was
performed, and sections were stained using a standard HRP/DAB kit (Vector
laboratories, CA). Rat anti-mouse panendothelial cell antigen (MECA-32, 1:250,
550563, BD Biosciences) and rabbit anti-Pimo staining was performed to
determine baseline tumour characteristics before treatment when tumours were
B100 mm3. For anti-CD3 staining, Py8119 and Py117 tumours from a cohort of
mice that were untreated or treated with 12 Gy RT when average tumour size was
100 mm3 were harvested 10 days after treatment and paraffin embedded. Tumour
sections were treated as above and stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-CD3
antibody (1:200, AB5690, Abcam). DAB was developed until precipitation was
noted in specific areas of tumour sections. In all cases control staining’s with no
primary antibody was performed to confirm specific HRP-DAB precipitation.
Serial sections of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) were obtained. Slides were imaged
using a Leica DM6000B microscope (Leica, Germany). MECA-32 microvessel
staining quantification was performed using the Photoshop counting tool
evaluating three tumours and three fields per tumour at � 200 magnification.
Pimo was quantified using ImageJ by imaging multiple tumour sections at � 100
integrating total hypoxic area divided by the total tumour area at to determine the
% hypoxic area per tumour.
Flow cytometry. For cell experiments, tumour cells grown in vitro trypsinized,
washed, stained with fluorophore labelled antibodies for 20 min on ice in PBS
containing 3% FBS staining buffer, washed two times in � 10 volume staining
buffer and kept on ice then analysed by flow cytometry. For IFN-g treatments
3.33 � 105 cells were treated with 25 ng ml � 1 of mouse recombinant IFN-g
(Peprotech) overnight in serum containing growth media. For tissue culture
radiation experiments, 1 � 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of growth media,
irradiated using a Cs source and then plated at 3.33 � 105 cells in six well plate for
24 h before harvesting for flow cytometry.
To create cell suspensions, tumours were removed, finely chopped, and
suspended in 1:1 F12K media and DMEM 5% FBS. Tumours were digested with
collagenase type I at 200 U ml � 1 (Worthington) and Dispase at 0.5 U ml � 1 (Stem
Cell Technologies, Canada) for 40 min at 37 �C then filtered through a 40 mm mesh.
Cells were resuspended in RBC lysis buffer for 10 min at room temperature. Cells
were resuspended in PBS, counted and then stained with Zombie NIR (BioLegend)
for live/dead cell discrimination. Cells were washed, fixed with 5% formalin
buffered saline for 20 min on ice washed, and then frozen at � 80 �C in cell
staining buffer until flow cytometry was performed. On the day of analysis cells

 were thawed on ice, FC receptors were blocked with CD16/32 Ab (BioLegend), and
then 1 � 106 were stained with conjugated Ab cocktail for 20 min on ice. Cells were
washed 2 � then resuspended for flow cytometry analysis.
For T-cell function experiments tumours were digested with 20 mg ml � 1
Liberase TL (Roche) and 400 mg ml � 1 DNAse (Roche) then digested for 30 min
followed by Percoll (VWR) centrifugation for larger tumours. Cells were stimulated
with 50 ng ml � 1 of PMA and 500 ng ml � 1 Inomycin for 3 h in the presence of 1x
Brefeldin A (eBiosciences). Cells were fixed and permeabilized using BD Cytofix/
Cytoperm kit and then stained for TNF-a and IFN-g. For Treg staining cells were
labelled with a live dead marker and surface antibodies then intracellular staining
of FoxP3 was performed using the FoxP3 mouse Treg cell staining kit
(eBiosciences).
Flow cytometry was performed on a three-laser FACS aria or a four laser LSRII
(BD Biosciences) in the Stanford Shared FACS Facility depending upon the
experimental requirements. Analysis was performed on FlowJo software (Tree
Star). Compensations were attained using compensation beads (Life Technologies)
or cells stained with single stains of live dead stain. The following mouse Ab clones
were used for analysis. Biolegend: CD45 (1:160, 103133, 30-F11), CD3 (1:80,
100237, 17A2), CD4 (1:400, 100406, GK1.5), CD8 (1:160, 100708, 53-6.7), CD11b
(1:400, 101243, M1/70), CD11c (1:200, 117310, N418), F4/80 (1:60, 123110/
123133, BM8), MHCII IA I-e (1:160, 107606, M5/114.15.2), GR-1 (1:160, 108408,
RG6-8C5) and PD-L1 (1:160, 124310, 10 F.9G2). BD Biosciences: MHCI H2Kb
(1:160, 553570, AF6-88.5), and Ki-67 (5ul per sample, 561126, B56). eBiosciences:
FoxP3 (1:100, 61-5773, FJK165), IFN-g (1:100, 11 � 7311, XMG1.2), TNF-a
(1:100, 61 � 7321, MP6-XT22), and TCR-b (1:200, 45 � 5961, H57 � 597). R&D
Systems (MN): Axl (1:60, FAB8541P, 175128). Gating schemes of dissociated
tumours was as follows: tumour cells (ZNIR �CD45 �), CD8 T-cells (ZNIR �
CD45þSSClowCD3 þCD8 þ), CD4 T-cells (ZNIR �CD45 þSSClowCD3 þCD4 þ),
macrophages (ZNIR �CD45 þCD11b þF4/80 þ), immature myeloid cells
(ZNIR �CD45 þCD11b þGR1 þ), myeloid dendritic cells or antigen presenting
myeloid cells (ZNIR �CD45 þCD11b þCD11c þMHCII þ) and CD4 þ Tregs
(AquaAmine �TCRb þCD4 þFoxP3 þ).
Whole-exome sequencing. Mouse genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp
DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen) and 100 ng DNA was sonicated to an average size of
150–200 bp. The KAPA Library Preparation Kit (Kapa Biosystems) was used for
library preparation, amplified with Illumina backbone oligonucleotides, and length
was determined using a 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies)45. SeqCap EZ
Mouse Exome (Roche NimbleGen, Inc.) was used for sequence capture and four
sample libraries were included in a single capture hybridization. DNA fragments
were amplified with Illumina backbone oligonucleotides and cleaned with
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). Quality and yield of libraries was
confirmed before sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 to a median depth of
42 � (Py117) and 33 � (Py8119). Paired-end reads were aligned to the mm9
reference genome using BWA-mem 0.7.5a. Variants were called using VarScan
2.3.6 with a minimum required depth of 10 reads, minimum of 3 variant
supporting reads and minimum variant allele fraction of 10%. Variants called in
both samples were excluded to remove germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms
and potential recurrent mapping artefacts. Variants were post-filtered to include
only coding changing (missense, stop-gain and frameshift or non-frameshift indel)
variants with at least five variant supporting reads and at least 10% variant allele
fraction.
Protein isolation and western blotting. For protein analysis, cells were lysed with
ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1%
SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche), then incubated on ice for 15 min, vortexed
and centrifuged at 13,000 r.p.m. Protein lysates were quantified using BCA
Protein Assay kit (Pierce), and 30–50 mg of protein samples were resolved by
SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to standard methods,
then transferred onto 0.2 mm supported nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). The following primary antibodies were used to detect specific
proteins: AXL (1:1,000; sc-1097, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-Axl (1:1,000;
CST 5724, Cell Signaling technology), Gas6 (1:2,000; BAR-986, R&D), NF-kB p65
(1:1,000; sc-372, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-STAT1 (1:1,000; CST 7647,
Cell Signaling Technologies), STAT1 (1:1,000; CST 9172, Cell Signaling technol-
ogies) HSP70 (1:2,000; #H5147, Sigma Aldrich), and b-Actin (1:5,000; #A5441,
Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies used in this study were HRP-conjugated
goat anti-mouse (1:10,000; Zymed Laboratories), HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
(1:5,000; #PI-1000, Vector Laboratories) and HRP-conjugated bovine anti-goat
(1:5,000; sc-2350, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoblots were developed with
SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and visualized with ChemiDoc XRS þ imaging system equipped with Image Lab
Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Protein bands were quantified by densitometry
using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). All gels from figures with
protein markers visible are shown in Supplementary Fig. 12.
Reverse phase protein array. For RPPA analysis, Py117 and Py8119 cells were
trypsinized and resuspended in F12K media then plated 3 � 105 in six-well plates.
When suspended in 15 ml conical vial cells were radiated in a Cs irradiator to
10 Gy. After 24 h incubation cells were washed with PBS � 2 then 150 ml RIPA lysis
buffer was added containing fresh protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Roche) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cells were scraped collected and
centrifuged at 13,000 r.p.m. for 10 min at 4 �C then the supernatant was isolated.
Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay and diluted to a final
concentration of 1 mg ml � 1. Lysate was then mixed with 4 � SDS sample buffer
containing 40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 0.24M Tris-HCl and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol.
Samples were heated at 100 �C for 5 min and stored at � 80 �C.
Samples were processed at the MD Anderson RPPA core facility according to
their standard mouse protocol evaluating 281 mouse antibodies (https://www.
mdanderson.org/education-and-research/resources-for-professionals/scientific-
resources/core-facilities-and-services/functional-proteomics-rppa-core/index.html).
Briefly, serial dilutions of lysates were arrayed on nitrocellulose-coated slides
(Grace Biolabs) using an Aushon 2470 Arrayer (Aushon Biosystems) with a total of
5,808 spots were arranged per slide. Each slide was probed with a validated primary
antibody plus a biotinylated secondary antibody. Antibodies had a Pearson
correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 between RPPA and western blot. Signal was
amplified using a Dako Cytomation-catalyzed system (Dako) and visualized by
DAB colorimetric reaction then slides were scanned, analysed, and quantified using
Microvigene software (Vigenetech Inc.) to generate spot intensity. Each dilution
curve was fitted with a logistic model (http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/
OOMPA) and fitted curve is plotted with observed and fitted signal intensities on
the y axis and the Log2 concentration of proteins on the x axis. The protein
concentrations of each set of slides were normalized by median polish, that was
corrected across samples by the linear expression values using the median
expression levels of all antibody experiments to calculate the loading correction for
each sample.
A heatmap was generated from the Log2 values comparing Py117 and Py8119
with and without radiation. EMT associated proteins differentially expressed
between the two cell lines were then plotted in a heatmap for comparison of the
pertinent differences identified.
Development of CRISPR Py8119 clones. To construct Axl CRISPR clones,
Py8119 cells were transfected with the mCMV promoter driving Edit-R Cas9
expression plasmid with a puromycin resistance marker (GE Life Sciences) using
the DharmaFECT Duo Transfection Reagent (GE Life Sciences). After 72 h, cells
were treated with 6 mg ml � 1 puromycin for 5 days. Cells growing under selection
were then transfected with Axl targeting crRNA (GCGCCAACCACCAGGCCA
GCGUUUUAGAGCUAUG CUGUUUUG) and tracrRNA (GE Life Sciences)
using Dharmafect Duo transfection reagent. After 5–7 days cells were analysed by
flow cytometry to verify population of cells with absent Axl surface expression.
Cells with no Axl expression were sorted, single cell dilutions were plated in 96-well
plate, clones were grown for 10–14 days and clones were screened for Axl
expression by flow cytometry.

and #2 were plated in 6 cm dishes with 3.33 � 105 cells. At 24 h media was changed
and then collected after 48 h, passed through a 0.2 mm filter, and concentrated with
an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal filters with 3 kDa cutoff (Millipore). Conditioned
media was stored at � 80 �C until processing. Triplicate samples for each cell line
were plated and collected independently on different days.
Mouse 38-plex kits were purchased form Affymetrix and used according to
manufacturer’s recommendations. The Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Core
processed samples as follows. Antibody linked beads were added to a 96-well plate
washed with Biotech Elx405 washer and 60 ml of concentrated conditioned media
samples were added and incubated for 1h at room temperature followed by
overnight incubation at 4 �C. Plates were washed and biotinylated detection
antibody was added for 75 min at room temperature with shaking. After a wash,
streptavidin PE was added for 30 min. The plate was washed and resuspended in
reading buffer was added and each sample was measured in duplicate. Plates were
read using a Luminex 200 instrument (Luminex Corp.) with a lower bound of 50
beads per sample cytokine. Custom assay Control beads (Radix Biosolutions) were
added to all wells. All sample values within a standard curve with lower limit of
0.43–37.22 pg ml � 1 and upper limit of 0.7–150 ng ml � 1 and that had higher values
than culture media with 5% serum were included for analysis. Mean fluorescence
intensity was used for comparison due to different buffers used for standards.
Real-time PCR. RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and subsequently
treated with DNase I (Fermentas). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed
with SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase and random primers (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was
carried out using Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Life Technologies), detection
and data analysis were executed with the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems) by computing the results relative to a standard curve made
with cDNA pooled from all samples, normalized to 18S. Primer sequences used to
amplify specific target genes were obtained from the Universal ProbeLibrary
(https://lifescience.roche.com/en_us/brands/universal-probe-library.html). Mouse
MHCI mRNA was amplified using forward primer 50-

TCGA data analysis. The TCGA breast invasive carcinoma data set was accessed
through the UCSC Cancer Browser (https://Genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/proj/site/
hgHeatmap/)30. RNAseq gene expression values from 1,215 patients in the data set
performed on the IlluminaHiSeq platform were obtained for the genes identified
in Fig. 4o. Gene signatures for PyMT Py8119 cell Axl associated genes (PyMT
signature) and an EMT signature adapted from Byers et al. and are listed in Fig. 4o
(ref. 31). Correlation analysis was performed using Pearson and Spearman
tests using Prism 6 software (Graphpad Software Inc.). The same analysis was
performed with the Pan-Cancer dataset containing human patient sequence
expression data for 9,755 patients with all types of cancers in the TCGA and the
Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia published in the UCSC Cancer Browser database.
Statistics. Clonogenic survival, flow cytometry, cell, molecule, and tumour
analysis, and Luminex cytokine assays were analysed in an analysis of variance
model and post hoc comparison was performed using a Tukey or Dunnett
adjustment as appropriate. Growth curves were analysed in a repeated measures
model allowing for errors to be correlated within mice. Post hoc pairwise
comparisons were performed using a Tukey adjustment. Mouse survival was
summarized using Kaplan-Meier curves and tested using a log-rank test. All
analyses were performed using SAS9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, NC) or GraphPad6
(Software Inc, CA).
