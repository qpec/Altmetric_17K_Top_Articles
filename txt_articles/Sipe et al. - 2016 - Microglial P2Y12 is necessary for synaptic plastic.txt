Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain. Increasingly, they are recognized as
important mediators of normal neurophysiology, particularly during early development. Here
we demonstrate that microglia are critical for ocular dominance plasticity. During the visual
critical period, closure of one eye elicits changes in the structure and function of connections
underlying binocular responses of neurons in the visual cortex. We find that microglia
respond to monocular deprivation during the critical period, altering their morphology,
motility and phagocytic behaviour as well as interactions with synapses. To explore the
underlying mechanism, we focused on the P2Y12 purinergic receptor, which is selectively
expressed in non-activated microglia and mediates process motility during early injury
responses. We find that disrupting this receptor alters the microglial response to monocular
deprivation and abrogates ocular dominance plasticity. These results suggest that microglia
actively contribute to experience-dependent plasticity in the adolescent brain.

icroglia are the canonical resident immune cells of the
central nervous system, with well-established roles in
pathological responses1. Historically, it was assumed
that microglia existed in a static ‘resting’ state until pathological
stimuli triggered their activation (migration, morphological
changes, proliferation, intensified phagocytosis and release of
pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators). However, landmark
studies demonstrated that microglia in the healthy brain are
highly motile, actively surveying the brain parenchyma2,3. This
dynamic behaviour has led to a new classification of homeostatic
microglial roles and has prompted new lines of research exploring
potential nonpathological roles of microglia in neurodevelopment
and adult circuit function. Indeed, accumulating evidence
suggests that microglia perform critical roles during neuro-
development,
often
using
signal
transduction
pathways
traditionally studied in neuroinflammation. For example, micro-
glia actively shape maturing neuronal networks within the first
few weeks of life in the mouse via the complement and fractalkine
systems4,5.
However,
microglial
contributions
to
network
maintenance and plasticity at later developmental stages and
the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the
present study, we investigated the role of microglia in ocular
dominance plasticity, a well-characterized model of adolescent
experience-dependent synaptic plasticity.
Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) was first described by
Hubel
and
Wiesel,
with
the
observation
that
monocular
deprivation (MD) during a critical period of development caused
a rearrangement of neuronal firing properties in the binocular
visual cortex of young kittens. Cells that were initially biased to
respond to inputs from the closed eye now responded more
strongly to inputs from the open eye6. Since then, this experience-
dependent plasticity has served not just to inform and improve
treatment of amblyopic children, but also as a model to
understand general mechanisms of activity-dependent plasticity
that are applicable to other brain regions and sensory systems,
both during development and throughout the lifespan. In fact,
recent work has shown that animal models of several human
neurodevelopmental diseases show disruptions of ODP, allowing
the visual system to be used to dissect the mechanisms
responsible for altered development in these disorders7,8.
Traditional studies of ODP have focused on neuro-intrinsic
pathways implementing experience-dependent changes in the
visual system. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that
extracellular matrix remodelling9–13 and myelination14 influence
plasticity, implying a possible role of glial cells in this process.
For example, several studies have reported that astrocytes may
contribute to plastic changes during the visual critical period15–17.
However,
microglial
involvement
in
ODP
has
remained
unknown.
Microglia dynamically interact with neuronal circuits, making
direct contacts with synaptic elements18,19 in a way that is modu-
lated by experience-dependent changes in neuronal activity19.
While the signalling pathways regulating these interactions are
not well understood, there are a number of receptors expressed by
microglia that can convey information regarding changes in
normal brain homeostasis1,20. The microglial expression of most
of these receptors has been demonstrated in vitro, but activation
of the Gi/o-coupled purinergic receptor, P2Y12, has been shown
to powerfully alter microglial dynamics in vivo21. P2Y12 is highly
sensitive to adenosine diphosphate, abundantly and selectively
expressed
in homeostatic
microglia, rapidly
downregulated
following the initiation of inflammation and elicits rapid and
pronounced chemotactic responses of microglial processes21,22.
In addition, its expression correlates strongly with a ramified
microglial morphology characteristic of healthy neurophysiology,
indicating that it primarily functions during rapid responses to
perturbations
of
brain
homeostasis21,23.
Given
the
well-
documented roles of purinergic signalling in neuron–astrocyte
communication24, we posited that P2Y12 may facilitate neuron–
microglia crosstalk during ODP.
Here we demonstrate that microglia react rapidly to changes in
cortical activity, increasing process arborization, reducing process
motility and increasing their interactions with synaptic elements.
Furthermore, disrupting P2Y12 signalling using pharmacological
or genetic methods significantly inhibits microglial behaviour
during MD and abrogates ODP. These findings implicate
microglia as key players in the execution of plastic changes in
cortical networks during experience-driven plasticity, and have
implications for the understanding of microglial contributions to
cognitive disorders where such functions are compromised.
Results
To determine whether microglia contribute to circuit changes
that occur during ODP, we first examined whether these cells
showed alterations in their dynamic behaviour following MD
during the visual critical period (P21–P35 in mice25). Because
microglial physiological attributes and roles are still poorly
defined, we focused on well-described microglial changes asso-
ciated with their pathological ‘activation’. We posited that if
microglia are active participants in periods of widespread synaptic
remodelling, then they may employ their traditionally patho-
logical repertoire in the nonpathological brain. When presented
with inflammatory stimuli, microglia can undergo morphological
changes, increase expression of several ‘activation’ markers,
proliferate and translocate to the pathological locus1. To assay
microglial morphological responses to different phases of ODP,
we examined microglia in fixed sections of binocular visual cortex
contralateral to the deprived eye in control animals (n ¼ 4) and
animals that were monocularly deprived for 12 h (n ¼ 3), 1 day
(n ¼ 3), 2 days (n ¼ 4), 4 days (n ¼ 4) or 7 days (n ¼ 3; Fig. 1a). In
adolescent mice, 1–4 days of MD elicit a loss of response to the
closed eye, while longer periods (4–7 days) are required to elicit
an enhancement of response to the open eye. Seven days of
deprivation
elicits
maximal
plasticity26.
While
qualitative
inspection of microglial morphology did not indicate obvious
signs of classical activation, which is typically characterized by a
retraction and thickening of processes and enlargement of the
soma, we used Sholl analysis to characterize in detail more subtle
changes of the microglial process arbor. This analysis uncovered a
rapid, robust and significant change in microglial morphology
(Fig. 1b; two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Po0.05). After
as little as 12 h of MD, microglial processes became hyper-
ramified, especially at a distance of 20–30 mm from the soma
(Supplementary Table 1). This hyper-ramification was main-
tained until 4 days of MD (4D MD), when the microglial arbor
returned to nearly basal dimensions. At 7 days of MD, microglial
morphology was not significantly different from control. To
ensure that microglial hyper-ramification was tied to ODP, we
repeated the experiment in a new cohort of mice and examined
microglial morphology in both the contralateral and ipsilateral
binocular visual cortex, as well as the contralateral somatosensory
cortex of mice that were either deprived for 12 h or left non-
deprived (ND; Fig. 1c). Our analyses confirmed that hyper-
ramification was limited to the contralateral binocular visual
cortex (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 1). In addition, changes
in process morphology were not accompanied by changes in
soma morphology as revealed by measuring soma area (Fig. 1e),
somatic intensity of Iba-1 expression (Fig. 1f) or expression of
two microglial activation markers, major histocompatibility
complex (MHC)-II and CD45 (Supplementary Fig. 1). This
suggests that, while microglial behaviour during periods of

 plasticity is reminiscent of changes observed during pathology,
the pathways used are distinct from traditional activation. Given
the rapid microglial response, our data also point to microglial
involvement in the early phase of ODP when the connections
serving the deprived eye are being weakened.
Microglia are remarkably dynamic in the intact brain. To
examine their dynamic behaviour over the course of ODP, we
used chronic non-invasive in vivo two-photon microscopy to
image fluorescent microglia in the CX3CR1-GFP reporter mouse
(CX3CR1GFP/ þ)27. Mice were prepared for chronic imaging
by thinning the skull over the binocular visual cortex. Microglia
were imaged at low magnification in layers 1–2 to determine
density (Fig. 2a,b) and then at higher magnification every 5 min
for 60 min to assay process motility (Fig. 2c,d). Animals were
reimaged either after 2 or 4 days of deprivation of the eye
contralateral to the imaged cortex and compared with animals
that had not been deprived during the same time period. We
found no change in microglial density at either 2 or 4 days of MD
as compared with ND mice (Fig. 2b; also confirmed in analysis of
fixed sections (Supplementary Fig. 2)). However, we found a
significant change in microglial process motility after deprivation.
While microglia displayed high levels of both extension and
retraction on the first day of imaging in both control and
experimental groups before deprivation was initiated, re-imaging
after 2 or 4 days showed a reduction in the motility of microglial
processes in the deprived animals only (Fig. 2d; Supplementary
Movies 1 and 2; two-way ANOVA; Po0.01). Given the
proliferation and increased process restructuring of microglia

 observed in pathological conditions, these results again support
the notion that distinct pathways are recruited in homeostatic
microglia.
Microglia have been suggested to phagocytose pre- and
postsynaptic elements to aid in synapse remodelling during
development and plasticity4,5,19,28. To gain insight into microglial
interactions with synapses after MD, we used electron microscopy
(EM) to analyse microglia–synapse interactions in the binocular
visual cortex at high spatial resolution (Fig. 3a). We found
that
Iba-1-positive
microglial
processes
were
characterized
by their irregular contours and surrounding extracellular space.
In addition, they frequently abutted synaptic elements such as
dendritic spines, axon terminals and perisynaptic astrocytic
processes. Occasionally, microglial processes were present at
the synaptic cleft (Fig. 3a). To quantitatively compare these
interactions between conditions, and control for the fact that
large processes have the ability to interact with more brain
elements and contain more inclusions, we normalized our obser-
vations to the size of the microglial process analysed. While the
analysis showed a trend towards an increase in the number of
microglial contacts with dendritic spines and axon terminals
during the early response to deprivation (1–4 days of MD), these
differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 3b; one-way
ANOVA; P40.05). The number of microglial contacts with
synaptic clefts, however, was significantly increased by MD
(Fig. 3c, one-way ANOVA, Po0.05) and remained elevated
throughout the deprivation period (up to 7 days). Microglial
processes also contained inclusions such as large vesicles, vacuoles
and endosomes containing cellular elements, which may indicate
active phagocytosis (Fig. 3b). Because we did not use serial
sectioning EM with three-dimensional reconstruction, we cannot
be sure that these inclusions represent true engulfment as
opposed to partial wrapping of microglial processes around
other brain elements. However, the number of processes with
such inclusions was significantly elevated following deprivation
(Fig. 3d, one-way ANOVA, Po0.05), with the highest number of
inclusions observed at 2-day MD, supporting an early role for
microglia in ODP during the pruning of connections from the
deprived eye. To determine whether such inclusions represent
true phagocytosis and contain synaptic elements, we performed
immunohistochemistry for GluA1, the main subunit of the
cortical glutamate receptor, in the binocular visual cortex of
ND and 4D MD CX3CR1GFP/ þ mice (Fig. 3e). GluA1 surface
expression has been shown to decrease during the early phase of
ODP when synapses from the deprived eye are eliminated and
increase when ND eye responses strengthen29. Three-dimen-
sional confocal analysis showed that, while most of the immuno-
reactivity for GluA1 was limited to puncta in the neuropil, some
puncta were contained within microglial cell bodies and processes
(Fig. 3f). A quantification demonstrated a significant increase in
GluA1 puncta within the microglial cytoplasm after deprivation
(Fig. 3g; Student’s t-test; Po0.0001), demonstrating active
engulfment of synaptic material by microglia during periods
of ODP.
Next, we sought to understand the importance of the micro-
glial contribution to ODP by disrupting microglial signalling

 resident
microglia
from
phenotypically
similar
infiltrating
macrophages23, suggesting that P2Y12 may serve microglia-
specific roles within the normal brain parenchyma.
We first confirmed that microglia in mouse primary visual
cortex express P2Y12 using immunostaining (Fig. 4a and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3) (ref. 21). P2Y12 labelling in the visual cortex was
widespread and highlighted the membranes of cortical microglia
expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP; CX3CR1GFP/ þ). To
understand how P2Y12 expression regulates microglial behaviour
both basally and during MD, we utilized the highly selective
P2Y12 antagonist, clopidogrel30, and P2Y12 knockout mice
(P2Y12KO) for pharmacologic or genetic P2Y12 disruption,
respectively. We crossed P2Y12KO animals with CX3CR1GFP
animals to generate CX3CR1GFP/ þ/P2Y12KO animals in which
we could image P2Y12KO microglia in vivo and determine
P2Y12’s effects on the microglial responses. We first verified
an effect of genetic P2Y12 knockout by confirming previous
reports that P2Y12KO animals have a reduced response to laser
ablation (Supplementary Movie 3) (ref. 21). We then sought to
validate pharmacologic P2Y12 blockade in CX3CR1GFP/ þ mice
using clopidogrel, which must be catalysed by the liver to produce
its active metabolite. Although this metabolite is predicted to
cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and previous studies have
shown central nervous system-specific effects after clopidogrel
treatment31, we verified clopidogrel’s cortical action in mice using
the laser-ablation response (Fig. 4b). Injections of 4% rhodamine
dextran into the vasculature allowed us to ensure that laser
ablation
did
not
damage
nearby
blood
vessels,
allowing
clopidogrel to access the brain directly during the experiment.
Clopidogrel
treatment
(50 mg kg � 1,
intraperitoneally
(i.p.))
significantly delayed the laser ablation response relative to
saline treatment (Fig. 4c; two-way ANOVA; Po0.01; Supple-
mentary Movies 4 and 5), suggesting that clopidogrel’s active
metabolite crosses the BBB at a level that can affect P2Y12-
mediated microglial responses. To confirm that these effects
observed using clopidogrel are due to central blockade of P2Y12,
we also used another P2Y12 inhibitor, ticagrelor, which is not
predicted to cross the BBB. Indeed, in our hands, treatment with
ticagrelor (10 mg kg � 1, i.p.) did not affect the microglial response
to laser ablation relative to saline treatment, showing that
this inhibitor is not BBB-permeant (Fig. 4c; two-way ANOVA;
Holm-Sidak post hoc; P40.05; Supplementary Movie 6).
To determine whether disruption of microglial signalling
through P2Y12 has functional consequences for ODP, we
compared ocular dominance shifts following 4 days of MD in
P2Y12WT animals treated with saline versus P2Y12WT animals
treated with clopidogrel, P2Y12WT animals treated with ticagrelor
or P2Y12KO animals. We used intrinsic optical signal (iOS)
imaging to quantify responses to contralateral and ipsilateral eye
input in binocular visual cortex and used the relative amplitudes
of the hemodynamic response to calculate an ocular dominance
index (ODI; Fig. 4d,e). As expected, ND controls treated with
saline had a strong contralateral bias (Fig. 4e,f). Similarly,
clopidogrel-treated, ticagrelor-treated and P2Y12KO-ND animals
also had strong contralateral biases, suggesting that P2Y12
disruption
does
not
disrupt
early
developmental
network
organization. Control mice treated with saline demonstrated an
ocular dominance shift following 4D MD, exhibiting similar
responses to the contralateral and ipsilateral visual inputs
(Fig. 4e,f; two-way ANOVA; Holm-Sidak post hoc; Po0.001).
However, this shift did not occur in either P2Y12WT animals
treated with clopidogrel or in P2Y12KO animals, which retained a
strong contralateral bias following 4D MD (Fig. 4e,f; two-way
ANOVA; Holm-Sidak post hoc; P40.05). Single-eye responses
indicated that 4D MD results in the depression of deprived eye
responses and that this effect is blocked in mice with defective
P2Y12 signalling (Supplementary Fig. 4). The defect in ODP
persisted in P2Y12KO animals, even when the deprivation period
was extended to 7 days, suggesting that disrupting P2Y12
signalling does not simply delay ocular dominance shifts.
Ticagrelor-treated animals, however, showed robust shifts after
4D MD (Fig. 4e,f; two-way ANOVA; Holm-Sidak post hoc;
Po0.05), suggesting that P2Y12 blockade must occur specifically
in the brain to affect ODP. Given the microglia-selective
expression of P2Y12 in the brain parenchyma, overall these data
suggest that homeostatic microglia are necessary for ODP, and
that P2Y12 signalling plays a critical role in this process.
We next investigated the mechanisms by which P2Y12
disruption alters microglial physiology during ODP. One possible
explanation for our results is that P2Y12 disruption decreases
basal microglial process ramification under steady-state condi-
tions, chronically preventing microglia from interacting with
synaptic elements. In fact, previous studies have suggested a tight
link between microglial ramification and P2Y12 expression21.
Therefore, we first examined P2Y12’s role in maintaining basal
microglial morphology. As before, we stained microglia for Iba-1
using immunohistochemical methods to label fine processes and
applied Sholl analysis on images generated with confocal
microscopy to quantify microglial process ramification (Fig. 5).
We found that, relative to control animals, both clopidogrel-
treated and P2Y12KO microglia had a modest but significant
decrease in basal process ramification (Fig. 5b,d; two-way
ANOVA; Holm-Sidak post hoc; Po0.05). This suggests that
P2Y12 signalling contributes to, but is not necessary for
maintaining microglial ramified morphology. In addition, we
obtained comparable results with both pharmacological and
genetic
P2Y12
ablation,
further
confirming
that
systemic
clopidogrel treatment disrupts P2Y12 signalling in the brain.
P2Y12 has a critical role in the rapid translocation of microglial
processes to areas of injury32. Thus, another possible explanation
for disrupted ODP after P2Y12 ablation is that P2Y12 may be
necessary for basal microglial motility and consequently for
synaptic surveillance. To explore this possibility, we used
CX3CR1GFP/ þ/P2Y12KO animals in which we could image
P2Y12KO microglia in vivo and determine P2Y12’s effects on
the basal motility of microglial processes. Time-lapse motility
images were collected using two-photon microscopy, and process
motility and stability were analysed using custom algorithms
(Fig. 6a; Supplementary Movies 7 and 8). We found no
differences in basal microglial process motility, retraction and
extension rates, and long-term stability between P2Y12KOand
P2Y12WT animals (Fig. 6b–e; Student’s t-test/two-way ANOVA;
P40.05), suggesting that P2Y12 is not critical for basal
surveillance.
Because we observed a chronic, modest reduction in basal
microglial ramification in the P2Y12KO during steady-state
conditions, we wondered whether P2Y12 is necessary for the
acute microglial hyper-ramification that we observed during MD.
To address this possibility, we measured changes in microglial
morphology during MD in P2Y12KO animals versus controls
(n ¼ 6 per group; contralateral binocular visual cortex). As before,
ND P2Y12KO microglia had decreased baseline ramification
compared with P2Y12WT controls (Fig. 7a–c and Supplementary
Table 2; two-way ANOVA; Po0.05). Following 12 h of MD,
P2Y12KO microglia were still hyper-ramified, as in P2Y12WT
animals, although this ramification was significantly decreased
compared with P2Y12WT microglia (Fig. 7a–c and Supplementary
Table 2; two-way ANOVA; Po0.05). By 2, 4 and 7 days of MD,
ramifications in P2Y12WT and P2Y12KO microglia returned to
baseline, although at 4 and 7 days MD, P2Y12KO microglia had a
more significant decrease in ramification than P2Y12WT micro-
glia (Fig. 7a–c and Supplementary Table 2; two-way ANOVA;

 Po0.05). Therefore, P2Y12 contributes to, but is not necessary
for microglial process hyper-ramification during MD.
Given the small effect of loss of P2Y12 on MD-induced
microglial hyper-ramification, we also wondered whether P2Y12
blockade may influence microglial motility after MD. We carried
out in vivo two-photon microscopy and compared microglial
motility in the contralateral binocular visual cortex of ND versus
4D MD P2Y12KO/CX3CR1GFP/ þ mice. We found that, unlike in
wild-type (WT) microglia, deprivation did not elicit a decrease in
microglial motility in P2Y12KO mice (Fig. 7d,e, Supplementary
Fig. 5 and Supplementary Movie 9), suggesting that P2Y12 is
necessary for some aspects of the microglial response to
deprivation, such as its effects on motility.
To test whether the effects of P2Y12 disruption on MD-
induced microglial ramification affect microglia–synapse interac-
tions, we used immuno-EM to compare P2Y12WT and P2Y12KO
microglia during MD. Because we observed an increase in
microglial contacts with synaptic clefts and phagocytic profiles
following 1–4 days of MD (Fig. 3), we collected tissue from the
contralateral binocular visual cortex of ND and 4D MD P2Y12WT
and P2Y12KO animals (n ¼ 5, per group; Fig. 8a). Comparing
P2Y12WT and P2Y12KO animals in the absence of deprivation
revealed no difference in the basal interactions between microglia
and synapses, including the prevalence of their contacts with
synaptic clefts and the prevalence of intracellular inclusions
(Fig. 8b,c). There were also no significant differences between
P2Y12WT and P2Y12KO microglia with regards to contacts with
dendritic spines, axon terminals and perisynaptic astrocytic
processes (Supplementary Fig. 6). However, while 4 days of MD
again induced an increase in microglial contacts with synaptic
clefts and intracellular inclusions in P2Y12WT animals (two-way
ANOVA; Holm-Sidak post hoc; Po0.05 and Po0.001, respec-
tively), neither of these interactions were modulated by MD
in P2Y12KO (n ¼ 5 per group; two-way ANOVA Holm-Sidak
post hoc; Fig. 8b; P40.05 and Fig. 8c; P40.05, respectively).
In addition, there was no increase in the density of GluA1
puncta contained within microglial cell bodies and processes in
4D MD P2Y12KO animals as compared with ND P2Y12KO mice
(Fig. 8d–f; Student’s t-test; t(5) ¼ 0.2373; P40.05). These findings
indicate that P2Y12 signalling could contribute to initiating
microglial interactions with synaptic elements and their subse-
quent phagocytosis during ODP. The disruption of these
behaviours in the absence of P2Y12 signalling may underlie the
observed inhibition of ODP.
Discussion
Our results suggest that microglia play a novel and critical role in
the activity-dependent remodelling of neuronal networks in late
development and are an integral part of the plastic machinery of
the nonpathological brain. We find that microglia rapidly
respond to experience-dependent changes in neuronal activity,
altering their morphology resulting in a hyper-ramified state,
decreasing the intrinsic motility of their processes and increasing
the interactions between processes and synapses (Supplementary
Fig. 7). The communication between neurons and homeostatic
microglia is mediated in part by purines, signalling through the
microglial P2Y12 receptor. Thus, P2Y12 is necessary not only for
early phases of the injury response but is an important mediator
of microglial roles in the healthy brain.
Although microglia were once considered static sentinels of the
immune system, remaining inactive until a pathological stimulus
prompted a response, increasing evidence suggests that microglia
are dynamic participants in neurodevelopment and normal
neurophysiology. Our experiments show that altering purinergic
signalling in microglia can have a severe impact on ODP, an
experience-dependent process occurring in the visual cortex at
late developmental stages when microglia have already adopted
their adult, ramified morphologies. Thus, mature microglia are
crucial players in activity-dependent plasticity. Several aspects
of
microglial
behaviour
following
MD
should
be
noted
(see Supplementary Fig. 7). First, microglia monitor neuronal
activity, either directly or indirectly, and sense changes that occur
in network activity levels. Second, microglia respond to such
changes remarkably rapidly, consistent with their roles as first
responders during pathological events. We observed hyper-

 ramification within 12 h after eye closure, a time point at which
neuronal synapses have not yet undergone plastic changes and
ocular dominance in cortical neurons within bV1 has not been
altered. This suggests that microglia are recruited early during a
plastic event and are not simply responding to plastic changes
occurring at synapses. Third, the rapid response of microglia
indicates that their involvement could be critical for the early
phase of ODP during which deprived eye responses weaken. Last,
it appears that microglia enact critical roles in synaptic plasticity
without altering expression of markers canonically upregulated
during pathological responses, suggesting that they possess a
repertoire of signalling mechanisms critical for normal neuro-
physiology that are independent of pathological activation.
Our data strongly point to microglia being involved in the early
phase
of
ODP.
We
observed
increased
phagocytosis
and
internalization of GluA1 receptors in microglia during this early
phase when GluA1 surface expression is known to be decreased29,
indicating that microglia may aid in the depression of deprived
eye responses by pruning synapses as described during early
development4. This is further supported by the lack of functional
deprived eye depression after P2Y12 blockade. Although the
presence of GluA1 receptor puncta within microglia implies that
postsynaptic sites are targets for microglia after deprivation, it is
likely that microglia target the whole synapse, a possibility that
will have to be examined closely in the future. Interestingly,
microglial interactions with synaptic clefts remain high for up to

 7 days of MD, which could imply an additional microglial
contribution to the strengthening of ND eye synapses. In fact,
microglia were recently shown to promote dendritic spine
formation through the release of brain-derived neurotrophic
factor during adolescent and adult motor plasticity33. While we
did not test this hypothesis, it is conceivable that microglia
respond to MD in two phases: a rapid surveillance, interaction
and phagocytosis of synaptic elements associated with decreased
synaptic input, followed by a period of enhancement of synaptic
outgrowth and maturation. When considering the functions of
microglia in ODP, It is also important to note that, while loss of
P2Y12 function occurs globally throughout the visual cortex in
these models, our analysis of microglial motility, phagocytosis
and synaptic contact was restricted to cortical layers 1 and 2.
Synaptic changes have been described to occur rapidly in these
layers9,12,34,35, and therefore microglial responses may need to
be equally rapid. However, there may be additional roles for
microglia in infragranular and granular layers, and these may
occur at slower timescales following MD36.
Neuroinflammatory factors may have basal functional roles
in the healthy brain, contributing to development, plasticity and
normal homeostasis. These include the classical complement
system4,37, signalling of the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1)
through its microglia-specific receptor, CX3CR1 (refs 5,28), the
traditional inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 beta38 and
tumour necrosis factor alpha39,40, as well as recognition mole-
cules such as MHC-I (ref. 41). Here we show that purinergic
signalling through P2Y12 is an important pathway in non-
pathological microglia that is critical for microglia–neuron
interactions during plasticity.
As a consequence of being the primary substrate for cellular
metabolism, intercellular ATP signalling is evolutionarily old
with highly conserved functions in monitoring tissue metabolic
homeostasis24. The high intracellular concentration and extensive
extracellular regulation of ATP produces a strong concentration
gradient where sudden increases in extracellular ATP convey
pathological
information
such
as
compromised
membrane
integrity of nearby cells2. Thus, most work investigating puri-
nergic signalling in microglia focuses on purinoceptors that
are stimulated by high levels of extracellular ATP and respond to
these concentrated changes in extracellular purines. However,

signal to microglia. P2Y12 expression is a hallmark of non-
pathological microglia, and many studies show that significant
levels of P2Y12 expression are limited to microglia within the
brain (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 3) (refs 23,45–47). P2Y12
expression can distinguish resident microglia from infiltrating
monocytes, suggesting that its signalling is important for

 microglial functions in the physiological brain23. Although P2Y12
mediates early microglial process extension towards sites of
injury, we demonstrate here that P2Y12 also contributes to
microglial roles in synaptic plasticity. Outside of the brain, P2Y12
is highly expressed by platelets in the blood and a subset of
macrophages23,48. Our experiments using a P2Y12 inhibitor that
does not cross the BBB—ticagrelor—demonstrate that blocking
P2Y12 peripherally does not affect plasticity. Taken together, our
studies suggest that P2Y12 signalling may represent a common
mechanism that enables microglia to respond to altered synaptic
activity either during injury or nonpathological changes in
network function.
While our study shows that purinergic signalling through the
P2Y12 receptor is a crucial mediator of synaptic refinement, it
does not address the processes that lead to ATP release,
downstream signalling in microglia or the mechanism mediating
microglial actions at synapses. The rapid morphological hyper-
ramification and phagocytosis, along with a literature that
implicates microglia in the phagocytosis of synaptic elements
during development4,28, suggests that P2Y12 may be part of a
pathway that targets synapses for monitoring and phagocytosis
during ODP (Supplementary Fig. 7). Recent work has suggested
that
neuronal
N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA)
receptor
stimulation can provoke local neuronal ATP release that is
sufficient to induce transient microglial process extension via
P2Y12 (refs 49,50). Whereas during injury, long-range signalling
of pathological events requires NMDA-mediated intercellular
calcium waves to activate microglia distant to the lesion, it is
possible that during ODP51, widespread NMDA signalling at
synapses is sufficient to release ATP locally and trigger the
recruitment of nearby microglial processes. Interestingly, the first
phase of ODP requires NMDA receptor-dependent long-term
depression (LTD)52. However, because hyper-ramification also
occurs in P2Y12KO microglia, it is unlikely that neuronal ATP
release is the global signal that allows microglia to sense changes
in neuronal activity during ODP. This suggests that the initial
hyper-ramification does not target microglial processes to
synapses but instead serves as an initial alert, allowing micro-
glia to adopt a state that aids in their subsequent actions at
synapses. Once microglia have been alerted through another
mechanism, P2Y12 signalling may then be involved in the
extension of processes specifically towards synapses undergoing
LTD.
Thus, P2Y12 signalling would result in the targeting of
microglial processes to synaptic elements requiring elimination,
at which point other pathways including those mediating
phagocytosis could become active. This may include pathways
that involve cross-membrane communication between deprived
synapses and microglial processes, such as MHC-I/PirB signal-
ling, which has known roles in ODP and is thought to require
microglial involvement53. Microglia can also potentiate NMDA
receptor activity through glycine release54 and promote LTD via
NADPH oxidase55, suggesting that microglia may have additional
roles in ODP besides phagocytosis once they target a synapse.
These data advocate the possibility that microglia sense and
facilitate initial periods of NMDA-mediated LTD in the weakened
contralateral inputs via P2Y12-dependent synapse targeting.
However, it is also possible that microglia respond to changes
in neuronal firing patterns indirectly via signalling through
other glial elements, such as astrocytes. This possibility is
supported
by
evidence
suggesting
that
astrocyte–microglia
communication dictates which synaptic elements should be
pruned during thalamo–cortical network refinement,56 and that
microglia respond to changes in ionotropic neurotransmission via
the intermediary release of ATP by astrocytes20. Future studies
will be needed to test whether weakened, deprived eye synapses
release ATP during LTD, and how their ATP release contributes
to the potentiation of ND eye connections.
Microglia in the developing brain have significantly different
phenotypes from microglia in the mature brain, and could have
different functions. Thus, the question remains as to whether and
how mature, ramified microglia participate in neurophysiological
brain function. While some studies suggest that without mature
microglia or microglial release of trophic factors learning-
dependent spine formation and subsequent behavioural improve-
ment are significantly decreased33, others show that cognition
and motor performance are not altered by pharmacological
elimination of mature microglia57. Here we show that altering
signalling through a single receptor in ramified microglia, either
genetically or pharmacologically, can severely inhibit neuronal
plasticity, suggesting that ramified microglia do, in fact, play
critical roles during activity-dependent plasticity. While more
work will be needed to elucidate the precise contributions of
microglia to different physiological processes within different
brain areas and at different points in the lifespan, our study
highlights the dynamic abilities of these cells to influence
neuronal function.
Methods
Animals. Experimental protocols were carried out in strict accordance with the
University of Rochester Committee on Animal Resources and conformed to the
National Institutes of Health Guidelines. Experiments were conducted on mice
with a C57/Bl6 background during the visual critical period (P25–35). All
experiments and analyses were carried out blind to genotype and manipulation.
Sex distribution is available in Supplementary Table 3.
Monocular deprivation. Animals were separated into ND or MD cohorts on
P28±1. MD animals were anaesthetized (isoflurane, 5% induction, 3% main-
tenance) and right eyelids resected and sutured together. Eyes were not reopened
except for intrinsic signal-imaging experiments. All analyses were carried out
contralateral to the deprived eye (that is, left hemisphere), unless stated otherwise.
Histology. Whole brains were collected following transcardial perfusion and
overnight post-fixation with paraformaldehyde (4%). Tissue was cryoprotected and
coronal sections were cut on a freezing microtome (Microm; Global Medical
Instrumentation, Ramsey, MN) at 50-mm thickness. Sections were processed free-
floating at room temperature (RT). Briefly, sections were rinsed and endogenous
peroxidase activity and nonspecific binding blocked. Sections were then incubated
in a primary antibody solution (24 h, 4 �C, anti-Iba-1, 1:1,000, Wako #019-19741;
anti-MHC-II, 1:7,500 BD Pharmingen #556999; anti-CD45, 1:1,000, Serotec
#MCA1031G; anit-GluA1, 1:500, EMD Millipore #PC246; anti-P2Y12, 1:1,000,
courtesy David Julius) followed by secondary antibody solution (4 h, RT,
Alexa-Fluor 488, 594 or 647, 1:500, Invitrogen), mounted and coverslipped.
For examination of microglial ramification and density, areas contained entirely
within binocular primary visual or primary somatosensory cortex were identified
and imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).
For each section, a z-stack encompassing the entire thickness of the section was
collected with a z-step of 1 mm at magnifications of � 20 and � 40. Analysis was
performed offline in ImageJ. Z-stacks were smoothed and compressed into a single
z-projection. For analysis of ramification, microglia in � 40 images whose entire
process arbor was contained within the image were individually selected and
cropped into a new image. Each image was thresholded to generate a binarized
outline of the process arbor, filtered to remove artefacts and analysed with an
automated Sholl analysis plugin (kindly provided by the Anirvan Ghosh laboratory,
UCSD). For analysis of microglial activation, sections stained with either MHC-II,
CD45 or Iba-1 were imaged on BX51 Olympus scope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan)
mounted with a Spot Pursuit RT colour digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments,
Sterling Heights, MI) at the same exposure settings. For quantitative analysis of
microglial soma size and Iba-1 expression, microglial somas were outlined
manually in ImageJ. The area- and background-subtracted mean intensity was
measured and averaged for all microglia in a single animal. Microglial density was
quantified on � 20 confocal images by manually counting the number of
Iba-1-positive microglial cell bodies present within a measured area.
For quantification of colocalization of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits within microglia, a two-channel
z-stack encompassing a 10-mm section of tissue was collected with a z-step of
0.5 mm at a magnification of � 100 using confocal microscopy. Analysis was
carried out offline in ImageJ. For each channel, z-stacks were smoothed and
thresholded. For accurate, objective thresholding, the triangle method of auto-
thesholding was selected58. The number of GluA1 puncta localized within

 microglial cell bodies and processes was determined by multiplying thresholded,
binarized z-stacks in each channel and quantifying the number of particles larger
than 1 pixel. Colocalization was determined as the number of internalized puncta
divided by the total area occupied by microglia.
Two-photon microscopy. A custom two-photon laser-scanning microscope was
used for in vivo imaging (Ti:Sapphire, Mai-Tai, Spectraphysics; modified Fluoview
confocal scan head, � 20 lens, 0.95 umerical aperture, Olympus). Excitation was
achieved using 100-fs laser pulses (80 MHz) at 920 nm with a power of B40 mW
measured at the sample after the objective lens. For baseline motility experiments, a
580/180 (GFP) filter was used. For laser ablation experiments, a 565 dichroic and
580/180 (GFP), 578/105 (rhodamine) filters were used. For microglial density and
baseline motility, mice were anaesthetized with Avertin (200 mg kg � 1, i.p.).
For P2Y12 disruption experiments, mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of
fentanyl (0.05 mg kg � 1, i.p.), midazolam (5.0 mg kg � 1, i.p.) and dexmetatomadin
(0.5 mg kg � 1, i.p.). During surgery and imaging, body temperature was maintained
at 37 oC. Imaging was carried out using � 1–10 digital zoom and 0.5–1-mm z-step.
Time-lapse imaging used 4–5-min imaging intervals over 1–2 h. Image analysis
was carried out offline in ImageJ or in Matlab using custom algorithms.
Microglial density was analysed by individually marking all cell bodies present
in the whole-field z-stack. The image channels were then separated to generate a
z-stack containing solely the cell-body markers. The z-stack was compressed into a
z-projection and the number of cell-body markers counted. This total cell number
was then divided by the combined area of all sections of the z-stack to generate a
measure of cell density.
Microglial motility after MD was measured by individually tracing and
measuring the length of the same individual microglial processes at 5-min intervals
over a 1-h period. For each animal, analysis was performed on a single microglial
process, defined as a process whose primary and secondary processes were clearly
visible in their entirety in all 12 z-stacks over the hour period. The sections
encompassing this process were identified for each of the 12 z-stacks and
compressed into a single image z-projection. Beginning with the z-stack
representing the 0-min time point, each individual process was traced, measured
and numbered. This process was repeated for each z-stack in the hour period.
Process motility was then calculated using the following formula: |(length of
processX @timeB � length of processX @timeA)/5 min|. Because these animals had
been anaesthetized using avertin, time-lapse imaging was not stable enough to
allow for a more automated analysis of motility (see below).
Microglial motility for P2Y12 KO animal comparison was performed in
ImageJ and Matlab using custom algorithms. Time-lapse imaging consisting of
40-mm-deep z-stacks were collected every 4 min, 12 times, for a total of 48 min.
Single-image 15-mm Z-projections were created for each time point, and lateral
motion artefact was corrected. Z-projections were then thresholded and time
points compared. RGB overlays were created for each pair of time points (0–4 min,
4–8 min and so on) such that red pixels (retraction) were present in the first time
point, but absent in the second. Green pixels (extension) were present in the
second, but not in the first, and yellow pixels (stable) were present in both time
points. Motility index (representing change over 4 min) was then calculated for
each RGB overlay as the sum of all extension and retraction pixels divided by
yellow pixels and averaged across all RGB overlays. A custom MatLab programme
was used to compare pixels across multiple RGB overlays (for example, 0–4 min
versus 4–8 min). Stability index was calculated as the proportion of extension pixels
(green) in one RGB overlay that became stable (yellow) in the subsequent overlay
divided by the total extension (green) pixels in the first overlay. Conversely, an
instability index was calculated as the proportion of stable (yellow) pixels in one
overlay that became retracted (red) in the subsequent overlay divided by the total
stable (yellow) pixels in the first overlay. Finally, the stability histogram compared
the relative stability over multiple overlays of pixels that became stable at any time
point in the imaging session (but omitting all pixels that were stable for the entire
imaging session, generally somas or primary processes). For both sets of motility
experiments, we did not observe trends towards increased or decreased motility
when comparing the first three imaging time points to the last three imaging time
points.
Laser ablations were produced by performing a point scan for 3–4 s at 780 nm
using B75 mW at the sample. Quantification of microglial response to laser
ablation was measured as previously described2 by calculating the number of
microglial processes entering from an outer radius (Y, B80 mm from ablation) into
an inner radius (X, B40 mm from ablation) as a function of time. Time-lapse
z-projections were produced and thresholded to normalize background variability.
The total number of pixels in X and Y were measured across time (Rx(t); Ry(t)) and
ablation response was calculated using the equation R(t) ¼ (Rx(t) � Rx(0))/Ry(0).
The vasculature was labelled using a retro-orbital injection of 4%
tetramethylrhodamine dextran in saline to ensure that the BBBwas not
compromised by laser injury.
Electron microscopy. EM was performed as previously described59,60. Briefly,
the primary visual cortex was prepared with 0.1% sodium borohydride (in 0.1 M
PBS), washed and processed freely floating following a pre-embedding
immunoperoxidase protocol. Sections were incubated with anti-Iba-1 (48 h, RT,
1:1,000, Wako), goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to biotin (2 h, RT, Jackson
Immunoresearch) and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase
(1 h, RT, Jackson Immunoresearch). Immunoreactivity was visualized with
diaminobenzidine (0.5 mg ml � 1) and H2O2 (0.03%; DAB Peroxidase Substrate Kit;
Vector Laboratories).
Sections for EM were post-fixed (1% OsO4), dehydrated, treated with propylene
oxide, impregnated in Durcupan (24 h, RT, EMS), mounted between ACLAR-
embedding films (EMS) and cured (48 h, 55 �C). Binocular primary visual cortex
(bV1) was excised and ultrathin sections (60–80 nm) were cut (Reichert Ultracut E)
and images generated (Hitachi 7650 Transmission Electron Microscope, Gatan
Erlangshen camera). Approximately 50–80 pictures were randomly taken at
� 30 000 in Layer 2 of bV1 (B10 mm from pial surface) corresponding to
B1,000 mm2 of neuropil per animal. Cellular profiles were identified using a series
of criteria previously defined in single-ultrathin sections19,61. All subcellular
profiles that were difficult to identify were classified as ‘unknown’. For
quantification, measurements were normalized to the area of individual microglial
processes to account for the fact that large processes have the ability to interact
with more brain elements and contain more inclusions than smaller processes.
Elements were classified as follows. Dendritic shafts cut longitudinally were
recognized by their irregular contours, elongated mitochondria parallel to their
central axis, frequent protuberances (spines, filopodia and small branches) and
synaptic contacts with axon terminals (see below). When cut transversally,
dendritic shafts were identified by their rounded morphology, frequent occurrence
of mitochondria and microtubules, and distinguished from unmyelinated axons by
their larger diameter. Dendritic spines cut longitudinally often protruded from
dendritic shafts, displayed rounded morphologies and were generally free of
mitochondria. They were characterized primarily by the presence of electron-dense
accumulations (postsynaptic densities) at sites of synaptic contact with axon
terminals.
Axonal terminals were distinguished from other subcellular profiles based
primarily on the presence of 40-nm-diameter synaptic vesicles, with rounded to
elongated morphologies, but also of synaptic contacts with dendritic shafts and
spines. Axon terminals generally contained mitochondria.
Protoplasmic astrocytes were recognized as electron-lucent structures seen to
encase and wrap around other neuropil structures. As a result, astrocytes
maintained irregular and angular shapes, distinguishing them from other neuronal
profiles having a characteristic rounded shape. Perisynaptic astrocytic processes
were defined by their direct contacts with axon terminals and/or dendritic spines.
Microglial processes displayed irregular contours with obtuse angles, distinctive
long stretches of endoplasmic reticulum visible through the 3,30-diaminobenzidine
staining, electron-dense cytoplasm, numerous large vesicles, occasional
multivesicular bodies, vacuoles or cellular inclusions and distinctive surrounding
extracellular space19, distinguishing them from astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or
NG2-positive glial cells.
Quantitative analyses of synaptic cleft interactions, element contacts and
inclusions were calculated by dividing the number of events per Iba-1-labelled
process by the area of the process (mm2) and averaging across processes (50–88
per animal). For measurement of microglial process areas, individual microglial
processes were traced with the freehand line tool in ImageJ. A Grubb’s outlier test
was used once to remove outliers (these were exceptionally small process whose
normalization yielded a very large number).
iOS imaging. P2Y12WT animals were injected with clopidogrel (50 mg kg � 1, i.p.,
Mylan S.A.S), ticagrelor (dose, i.p. kindly supplied by Lundbeck Research USA
Inc.) or saline daily for 4 days beginning the day of deprivation. Following 4 days of
ND or MD, animals were re-anaesthetized with isoflurane and chloroproxithene
(2 mg kg � 1), and sutured eyes reopened. The skull over contralateral visual cortex
was exposed, cleared, covered with agarose (0.5%) and sealed with a coverslip.
Animal anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (0.75%) throughout imaging.
A custom-made iOS imaging set-up was used to record activity in the visual
cortex during presentation of a visual stimulus (DALSA 2M30 CCD)62. The cortex
was illuminated with 550-nm light to identify vasculature and 700-nm light for iOS
collection. Images of the left visual cortex were collected continuously, while either
the ipsilateral or contralateral eye was stimulated by white horizontal square-wave
bar gratings on a black background moving upwards (90o) or downwards (270o) at
a frequency of 8o s � 1 for 6 min (30 cm from eyes). Visually evoked responses were
collected for each eye individually. The normalized amplitude of the fast Fourier
transform component of the intrinsic signal was averaged for each eye from
responses to both stimulus directions and compared between eyes offline using
MatLab to determine ocular dominance. An ODI was computed using the
following equation: ODI ¼ (average contralateral response � average ipsilateral
response)/(average contralateral response þ average ipsilateral response).

 For all analyses, a ¼ 0.05. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests and one-way or
