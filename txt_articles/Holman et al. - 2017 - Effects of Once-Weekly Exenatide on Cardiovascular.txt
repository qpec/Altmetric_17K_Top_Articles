BACKGROUND
The cardiovascular effects of adding once-weekly treatment with exenatide to usual 
care in patients with type 2 diabetes are unknown.
METHODS
We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes, with or without previous car-
diovascular disease, to receive subcutaneous injections of extended-release exenatide 
at a dose of 2 mg or matching placebo once weekly. The primary composite out-
come was the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. The coprimary hypotheses were that exena-
tide, administered once weekly, would be noninferior to placebo with respect to 
safety and superior to placebo with respect to efficacy.
RESULTS
In all, 14,752 patients (of whom 10,782 [73.1%] had previous cardiovascular 
disease) were followed for a median of 3.2 years (interquartile range, 2.2 to 4.4). 
A primary composite outcome event occurred in 839 of 7356 patients (11.4%; 3.7 
events per 100 person-years) in the exenatide group and in 905 of 7396 patients 
(12.2%; 4.0 events per 100 person-years) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.00), with the intention-to-treat analysis 
indicating that exenatide, administered once weekly, was noninferior to placebo with 
respect to safety (P<0.001 for noninferiority) but was not superior to placebo 
with respect to efficacy (P 
= 
0.06 for superiority). The rates of death from cardio-
vascular causes, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, 
hospitalization for heart failure, and hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, 
and the incidence of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, medullary thyroid 
carcinoma, and serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with type 2 diabetes with or without previous cardiovascular 
disease, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events did not differ sig-
nificantly between patients who received exenatide and those who received pla-
cebo. (Funded by Amylin Pharmaceuticals; EXSCEL ClinicalTrials.gov number,

Exenatide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
T
he risk of death from any cause 
among persons with type 2 diabetes is up 
to twice that of the general population,1 
and the risk of death from cardiovascular causes 
is up to four times that of the general popula-
tion.2,3 Improved glycemic control has been shown 
to improve microvascular outcomes,4,5 but a bene-
ficial effect on macrovascular outcomes is less 
certain.6 In trials that assessed cardiovascular 
outcomes associated with the use of newer glucose-
lowering agents, no effect on major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE) was shown with 
three dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors 
(saxagliptin, alogliptin, and sitagliptin)7-9 and one 
exendin-4–based glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
receptor agonist (lixisenatide),10 but a lower risk 
of MACE was shown with two GLP-1 receptor 
agonists (liraglutide and semaglutide)11,12 and 
two sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) 
inhibitors (empagliflozin and canagliflozin).13,14
A once-weekly, injectable, extended-release for-
mulation of exenatide, an exendin-4–based GLP-1 
receptor agonist approved for the treatment of 
type 2 diabetes, has been shown to lower blood 
glucose and induce modest decreases in body 
weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels15,16 but 
has also been shown to increase heart rate.17,18 
In accordance with regulatory guidance,19,20 the 
Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lower-
ing (EXSCEL) assessed the long-term cardiovas-
cular safety and efficacy of exenatide, administered 
once weekly, in patients with type 2 diabetes 
who had a wide range of cardiovascular risk.
Methods
Trial Oversight
We conducted this pragmatic, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial at 
687 sites in 35 countries. The design of this aca-
demically led trial has been reported previously.21 
A diagram showing the overall design is provided 
in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. 
The trial was conducted jointly by the Duke 
Clinical Research Institute and the University of 
Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit in collaboration with 
the sponsor, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca. The protocol, 
which was approved by the ethics committee at 
each participating site, and the statistical analy-
sis plan are available at NEJM.org. The statistical 
analyses were performed by the Duke Clinical 
Research Institute, independent of the sponsor. 
Details of the trial organization and a complete 
list of the investigators are provided in the Sup-
plementary Appendix.
All the patients provided written informed 
consent. Our trial was designed and overseen by 
a steering committee composed of nine investi-
gators and two employees of the sponsor. An 
independent data and safety monitoring commit-
tee, who had access to unblinded data, performed 
regular safety surveillance. All the authors had 
access to the final trial results and vouch for the 
accuracy and completeness of the data and 
analyses and for the fidelity of the trial to the 
protocol. The manuscript, drafted by the second 
and third authors, was revised and approved by 
all the authors, who assume responsibility for its 
accuracy and completeness and made the deci-
sion to submit the manuscript for publication.
Trial Population
Adults with type 2 diabetes (defined as a glycated 
hemoglobin level of 6.5 to 10.0% [48 to 96 mmol 
per mole]) were eligible for participation in the 
trial. The trial was designed such that approxi-
mately 70% of enrolled patients would have had 
previous cardiovascular events and 30% would 
not have had previous cardiovascular events. 
Previous cardiovascular events were defined as a 
history of major clinical manifestation of coro-
nary artery disease, ischemic cerebrovascular dis-
ease, or atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease. 
Patients were permitted to receive up to three 
oral glucose-lowering agents or to receive insulin, 
either alone or in combination with up to two 
oral glucose-lowering agents. Key exclusion cri-
teria were a history of two or more episodes of 
severe hypoglycemia (defined as hypoglycemia for 
which a patient received third-party assistance) 
during the preceding 12 months, end-stage kid-
ney disease or an estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate (eGFR) at entry of less than 30 ml per 
minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area, a per-
sonal or family history of medullary thyroid car-
cinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, 
a baseline calcitonin level of greater than 40 ng 
per liter, or previous treatment with a GLP-1 
receptor agonist.
Randomization and Trial Regimen
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive subcutaneous injections of extended-
release exenatide at a dose of 2 mg or matching

placebo once weekly. An interactive voice-response 
system assigned patients on the basis of computer-
generated block randomization within each site, 
with stratification according to history of car-
diovascular disease. Patients were required to 
discontinue the trial regimen if they had two or 
more occurrences of severe hypoglycemia be-
tween trial visits (despite adjustment of other 
glucose-lowering agents), if they had irreversible 
kidney dysfunction (confirmed by two consecu-
tive eGFR values of <30 ml per minute per 1.73 m2) 
or received renal-replacement therapy, or if they 
were found to have an elevated calcitonin level 
(>40 ng per liter at baseline or ≥50 ng per liter 
thereafter). Calcitonin levels were measured at a 
central laboratory at baseline and annually there-
after. Other laboratory values were obtained from 
usual-care blood sampling, which was consistent 
with the pragmatic design of the trial. In order to 
minimize potential confounding effects of dif-
ferential glycemic levels on trial outcomes, the 
use of open-label glucose-lowering agents (includ-
ing DPP-4 inhibitors but not including GLP-1 
receptor agonists) was encouraged to promote 
glycemic equipoise between the two trial groups 
and to help patients reach clinically appropriate 
glycated hemoglobin targets.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was defined as the first 
occurrence of any component of the composite 
outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke 
(three-component MACE outcome), in a time-to-
event analysis. Secondary outcomes included 
death from any cause, death from cardiovascular 
causes, and the first occurrence of nonfatal or 
fatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal or fatal 
stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syn-
drome, and hospitalization for heart failure, in 
time-to-event analyses. An independent clinical 
events classification committee whose members 
were unaware of the trial-group assignments ad-
judicated all the components of the primary com-
posite outcome, secondary outcomes, ventricular 
arrhythmias that led to intervention, neoplasms, 
and pancreatitis; these events are defined in the 
Clinical Event Definitions section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Additional outcomes that were prespecified 
in the protocol included a composite of death 
from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for 
heart failure, the first confirmed revasculariza-
tion procedure, initiation of the first interven-
tional glucose-lowering medication received dur-
ing the trial other than the trial regimen, and 
absolute values and changes from baseline in 
glycated hemoglobin level, body weight, blood 
pressure, and lipid levels. Prespecified events of 
clinical interest for which information was col-
lected systematically at every follow-up visit, 
regardless of seriousness, were pancreatitis, neo-
plasm, severe hypoglycemia, and expected car-
diovascular or diabetes-related complications. 
Information on other nonserious adverse events 
was not collected (details are provided in Section 
10.3 in the protocol).
Patients were followed for adverse events un-
til the end of the trial or 70 days after discon-
tinuation of the trial regimen. For patients who 
were either lost to follow-up or had withdrawn 
consent, vital status was ascertained during the 
70-day washout period by searches conducted 
with the use of local or national electronic 
health records, death registries, or other publicly 
available sources (as permitted by local ethics 
approvals).
Statistical Analysis
Information on sample size and power calcula-
tions has been published previously 
21; we esti-
mated that with 1360 patients with a confirmed 
primary composite outcome event, the trial would 
have 85% power to detect a risk of a primary 
composite outcome event that was 15% lower 
with once-weekly administration of exenatide 
than with placebo, at a two-sided alpha level of 
0.05. The time-to-event analyses were performed 
with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards 
model for primary, secondary, and exploratory 
outcomes in the intention-to-treat population, 
stratified according to history of cardiovascular 
disease, with trial regimen as an explanatory 
variable. The intention-to-treat population includ-
ed all patients who underwent randomization. 
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate 
event rates. The primary safety hypothesis was 
that exenatide, administered once weekly, would 
be noninferior to placebo for the primary out-
come, with a noninferiority margin of 1.3 for the 
upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence 
interval of the hazard ratio. The primary efficacy 
hypothesis was that exenatide, administered once 
weekly, would be superior to placebo, with a

superiority margin of less than 1.0 for the upper 
limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval. 
The statistical analysis plan prespecified the use 
of hierarchical testing in the following order: 
noninferiority for the primary composite out-
come, superiority for the primary composite 
outcome, superiority for all-cause mortality, supe-
riority for each component of the cardiovascular 
composite (tested with the use of the Hochberg 
procedure), and finally, if all three components 
were superior, superiority for hospitalization for 
acute coronary syndrome and for hospitalization 
for heart failure (tested with the use of the Hoch-
berg procedure). In accordance with the hierarchi-
cal testing plan, if a significant difference was 
not found for an outcome, formal hypothesis 
testing was not to be conducted for the remain-
ing ordered outcomes.
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy 
outcome were performed in the per-protocol 
population, which included all randomized pa-
tients who received at least one dose of the trial 
regimen and had no major protocol violations 
(see the protocol for further details). The safety 
analyses were performed in patients who under-
went randomization and received at least one 
dose of exenatide or placebo.
Baseline characteristics were summarized as 
means and standard deviations, medians and 
interquartile ranges, or percentages. The primary 
composite outcome was analyzed in prespecified 
subgroups that were defined according to base-
line characteristics, including age at randomiza-
tion, sex, race, geographic region, type of glucose-
lowering therapy, duration of diabetes, history 
or no history of a cardiovascular event or heart 
failure, body-mass index, glycated hemoglobin 
level, and kidney function. Repeated measures, 
such as glycated hemoglobin level and body 
weight, were analyzed with the use of longitudi-
nal models with mixed effects, with differences 
between the trial groups estimated by least-
squares mean differences with 95% confidence 
intervals. Analyses were conducted with the use 
of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Trial Patients
In all, 14,752 patients (of whom 10,782 [73.1%] 
had previous cardiovascular disease) underwent 
randomization from June 18, 2010, through Sep-
tember 16, 2015, and were included in the inten-
tion-to-treat population; 7356 patients were as-
signed to receive exenatide and 7396 to receive 
placebo once weekly (Fig. S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).22 The planned closeout of follow-
up of the patients was from December 5, 2016, 
to May 11, 2017, after the prespecified required 
minimum of 1360 patients were confirmed to 
have had a primary composite outcome event.
The demographic, disease, and clinical char-
acteristics of the patients did not differ signifi-
cantly between the groups, nor did the use of 
glucose-lowering agents or medications to reduce 
the risk of cardiovascular disease, with the excep-
tion of lipid-lowering medications and SGLT-2 
inhibitors (Table S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).22 At baseline, the median length of time 
that patients had had diabetes was 12.0 years 
(interquartile range, 7.0 to 18.0), the median 
glycated hemoglobin level was 8.0% (interquar-
tile range, 7.3 to 8.9) (63.9 mmol per mole [inter-
quartile range, 56.3 to 73.8]), and 2389 patients 
(16.2%) had a history of heart failure.
A total of 14,187 patients (96.2%) completed 
the trial, and vital status was obtained for 98.8% 
of the patients. The median duration of follow-
up was 3.2 years (interquartile range, 2.2 to 4.4; 
maximum, 6.8) and was similar in the two 
groups. The median duration of exposure to the 
trial regimen was 2.4 years (interquartile range, 
1.4 to 3.8) in the exenatide group and 2.3 years 
(interquartile range, 1.2 to 3.6) in the placebo 
group. The mean percentage of time that partici-
pants received the trial regimen (i.e., the dura-
tion of time that participants received the trial 
regimen relative to the duration of time that they 
were expected to receive the regimen during the 
trial) was 76.0% and 75.0%, respectively. Prema-
ture discontinuation of the trial regimen was 
primarily the result of decision by the patient 
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Changes in Risk Factors
At 6 months, the mean glycated hemoglobin 
level was 0.7 percentage points lower in the ex-
enatide group than in the placebo group (95% 
confidence interval [CI], −0.7 to −0.6). This dif-
ference narrowed during the course of the trial 
(overall least-squares mean difference, −0.53%; 
95% CI, −0.57 to −0.50; P<0.001) (Fig. 1). Overall 
least-squares mean values were also lower with 
exenatide than with placebo with respect to body

Exenatide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
weight (difference of −1.27 kg), systolic blood 
pressure (−1.57 mm Hg), low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (−1.5 mg per deciliter [−0.04 mmol 
per liter]), and triglycerides (−1.8 mg per deciliter 
[−0.02 mmol per liter]); values were higher in the 
exenatide group than in the placebo group with 
respect to diastolic blood pressure (difference of 
0.25 mm Hg) and heart rate (difference of 2.51 
beats per minute) (Fig. 1, and Figs. S3 through 
S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Primary and Secondary Cardiovascular 
Outcomes
A primary composite outcome event occurred in 
839 of 7356 patients (11.4%; 3.7 events per 100 
person-years) in the exenatide group and in 905 of 
7396 patients (12.2%; 4.0 events per 100 person-
years) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 
95% CI, 0.83 to 1.00), with the intention-to-treat 
analysis indicating that exenatide, administered 
once weekly, was noninferior to placebo with 
respect to safety (P<0.001 for noninferiority) and 
was not superior to placebo with respect to effi-
cacy (P 
= 
0.06 for superiority) (Table 1 and Fig. 2, 
and Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
There was no evidence of heterogeneity among 
the three components of the composite outcome 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
per-protocol primary analysis resulted in a hazard 
ratio that was similar to that of the intention-to-
treat analysis (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85 to 
1.07; P<0.001 for noninferiority, P 
= 
0.39 for supe-
riority), also without evidence of heterogeneity 
among the composite components.
The risk of death from any cause was 6.9% in 
the exenatide group and 7.9% in the placebo 
group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.97); 
this difference was not considered to be statisti-
cally significant on the basis of the hierarchical 
Figure 1 (facing page). Effects of Once-Weekly Exenatide.
Shown are the effects of once-weekly administration of 
exenatide on glycated hemoglobin levels, body weight, 
systolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Overall least-
squares mean differences were estimated from the model 
that included only the patients in whom a baseline value 
and at least one postbaseline value were obtained.

The primary outcome was the first occurrence of any component of the composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal 
myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, in a time-to-event analysis. This analysis was conducted in the intention-to-treat population, which 
consisted of all patients who underwent randomization.
†  
Hazard ratios (exenatide vs. placebo) and confidence intervals were estimated with the use of a Cox proportional-hazards regression model, 
stratified according to history of cardiovascular disease, with trial regimen as the sole explanatory variable.
‡  
Death from cardiovascular causes includes death from unknown cause.
§  
The incidence rate was not calculated because this outcome was not prespecified in the statistical analysis plan as a trial outcome.

Exenatide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
testing plan (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Causes of death 
were adjudicated as cardiovascular in 45.4% of 
the patients in the exenatide group and in 41.3% 
of the patients in the placebo group, as noncar-
diovascular in 32.9% and 34.4% of the patients, 
respectively, and as unknown in 21.7% and 24.3% 
of the patients (Table S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The rates of the first fatal or nonfatal 
myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke 
(Figs. S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appendix), 
and other secondary outcomes did not differ sig-
nificantly between the two groups. In univariate 
analyses of the primary composite outcome in 
16 prespecified subgroups that were defined ac-
cording to baseline characteristics, only the sub-
group of patients characterized by a baseline age 
of younger than 65 years versus 65 years or older 
showed heterogeneity (P 
= 
0.005, unadjusted for 
multiplicity) (Fig. 3). Results of the prespecified 
sensitivity analyses for the primary composite 
outcome are shown in Figure S9 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Additional Efficacy Outcomes
The rate of cardiovascular or peripheral revascu-
larization procedures was similar in the two 
groups (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.05). 
Patients randomly assigned to exenatide, admin-
istered once weekly, had a lower risk of receiving 
an additional cointerventional glucose-lowering 
agent than patients in the placebo group (hazard 
ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.71; P<0.001) and a 
lower risk of initiating long-term insulin therapy 
(hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.68; P<0.001), 
with less open-label use of SGLT-2 inhibitors (in 
6.5% vs. 9.4% of the patients) and GLP-1 recep-
tor agonists (2.5% vs. 3.6%) during follow-up 
(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). New 
concomitant cardiovascular and other medica-
tions administered during follow-up are listed in 
Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Safety Outcomes
No clinically relevant between-group differences 
were seen in the incidence of serious adverse 
events or events of clinical interest (Table 2, and 
Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Con-
firmed events of acute pancreatitis were uncom-
mon, and the number of patients who had con-
firmed acute pancreatitis was similar in the 
exenatide group and the placebo group (26 and 22, 
respectively), as were the number of patients 
who had cancers overall (355 and 361) and the 
numbers of patients who had pancreatic cancer 
(15 and 16) and medullary thyroid carcinoma 
(2 and 1). More patients in the exenatide group 
than in the placebo group had thyroid papillary 
carcinomas (10 vs. 4).
The rate of severe hypoglycemia did not differ 
significantly between the two groups, either 
when measured as the first event only (1.0 events 
per 100 patient-years in the exenatide group and 
0.9 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo 
group) or when recurrent events were included 
(1.6 events per 100 patient-years and 1.8 events 
per 100 patient-years, respectively; risk ratio, 
0.85; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.08) (Table 2).
Discussion
In this pragmatic, multinational, cardiovascular 
outcomes trial, which was performed in a usual-
care setting among patients with type 2 diabetes, 
with or without previous cardiovascular disease, 
the addition of once-weekly extended-release 
exenatide to usual care was compared with usual 
care alone for the management of diabetes and 
cardiovascular risk factors over a median of 
3.2 years of follow-up; the results showed that 
exenatide was noninferior to placebo with respect 
to cardiovascular safety but was not superior to 
placebo with respect to efficacy. The risk of death 
from any cause was 6.9% in the exenatide group 
and 7.9% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 
95% CI, 0.77 to 0.97); this difference was not 
considered to be statistically significant on the 
basis of the hierarchical testing plan. Events of 
acute pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and medul-
lary thyroid carcinoma were uncommon, with 
similar rates in the two groups.
The pragmatic design of the trial included 
integration with usual care and wide-ranging 
eligibility criteria. For example, patients with any 
degree of cardiovascular risk who were at least 
Figure 2 (facing page). Trial Outcomes.
Shown are the rates of the primary cardiovascular  
outcome (a composite of death from cardiovascular 
causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal 
stroke), death from any cause, death from cardiovascu-
lar causes, and hospitalization for heart failure in the 
exenatide and placebo groups. The inset in each panel 
shows the same data on an enlarged y axis.

Exenatide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Diabetes
18 years of age (with no upper age limit) were 
eligible. To further augment the potential gen-
eralizability of any findings, we evaluated the 
cardiovascular effect of once-weekly extended-
release exenatide in the usual-care setting by 
maintaining the focus of management of diabe-
tes and cardiovascular risk with the usual-care 
provider. There was no run-in period to prefer-
entially enhance adherence to the trial regimen. 
All open-label medications for diabetes were 
permitted (except for GLP-1 receptor agonists), 
including SGLT-2 and DPP-4 inhibitors.
In the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: 
Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results 
(LEADER) trial,11 a randomized trial in which 
patients with type 2 diabetes (mean glycated 
hemoglobin level, 8.7%) who had established 
cardiovascular disease (81% of enrolled patients) 
or cardiovascular risk factors were assigned to 
receive liraglutide or placebo, the risk of a three-
component MACE outcome event was lower with 
liraglutide than with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.87; 
95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97). Similar results were ob-
served in the Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and 
Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in 
Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN-6),12 a 
randomized trial in which patients with type 2 
diabetes (mean glycated hemoglobin level, 8.7%) 
who had established cardiovascular disease (83% 
of enrolled patients) or cardiovascular risk fac-
tors were assigned to receive semaglutide or 
placebo; the risk of a three-component MACE 
outcome was lower with semaglutide than with 
placebo (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58 to 
0.95). In the LEADER trial, the risk of death 
from any cause was 15% lower with liraglutide 
than with placebo (similar to the 14% difference 
seen in our trial), but no such difference was 
seen with semaglutide in SUSTAIN-6. In our 
trial, statistical significance for the primary com-
posite outcome was not achieved, but the direc-
tion and magnitude of the cardiovascular out-
comes observed were not inconsistent with those 
seen in the LEADER and SUSTAIN-6 trials. In 
contrast, the Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute 
Coronary Syndrome (ELIXA) trial,10 which com-
pared lixisenatide with placebo in patients who 
had had a recent acute coronary syndrome and 
who were followed for a median of 2.1 years, 
showed no significant difference between the 
groups in a four-component MACE outcome, nor 
in the rate of death from any cause.
The lack of cardiovascular efficacy in the cur-
rent trial may be related to multiple factors. The 
median follow-up time in our trial was shorter 
than that in the LEADER trial (3.2 years vs. 3.8 
years), as was the duration of exposure to the 
trial regimen (2.4 years vs. 3.5 years); in addi-
tion, the baseline glycated hemoglobin level in 
our trial was lower than that in the LEADER 
trial (8.0% vs. 8.7%), and the rate of discontinu-
ation of the trial regimen was higher. The effect 
of exenatide, administered once weekly, on modi-
fiable cardiovascular risk factors was modest. 
The disproportionate use in the placebo group of 
diabetes therapies known to reduce cardiovascu-
lar risk, such as SGLT-2 inhibitors13,14 and GLP-1 
receptor agonists,11 may have preferentially re-
sulted in lower event rates in the placebo group. 
Also, the four GLP-1 receptor agonists evaluated 
to date may not all be bioequivalent.
We did not observe any specific safety issues 
during our trial; there was no adverse signal 
with respect to heart failure, despite the higher 
mean heart rate in the exenatide group than in 
the placebo group, and events of acute pancreati-
tis and pancreatic cancer were rare, with similar 
rates in the two groups. Studies in animals have 
suggested a higher incidence of thyroid C-cell 
adenomas and carcinomas with once-weekly ad-
ministration of extended-release exenatide than 
with placebo,23 but that finding has not been 
replicated in humans. In our trial, medullary 
thyroid carcinoma was reported in two patients 
in the exenatide group, as compared with one 
patient in the placebo group; all three patients 
in whom medullary thyroid carcinomas oc-
curred had elevated calcitonin levels at baseline.
A major limitation of our trial was the rate of 
premature discontinuation of the trial regimen, 
which was driven primarily by patient decision. 
We speculate that probable factors for discon-
tinuation were the complexity of the first-gener-
ation injection device that was used24 and the 
fact that our trial had no run-in period. Another 
possible limitation was that usual-care regimens

introduced variability. The difference between 
the two groups in the rate of death from any

*  
This analysis was conducted in the safety population, which consisted of all patients who underwent randomization and 
received at least one dose of the trial regimen.
†  
This category included all patients who had at least one serious adverse event that was reported during the overall period, 
which was defined as the period from the date of randomization through the last date that the patient was known to be alive.
‡  
The time period for the reporting of adjudicated events was from the date of randomization through the trial termination 
visit or the date of the last event assessed, whichever was earlier.
§  
The term “charter-defined cancers” refers to definitions that were used by the clinical events classification committee in 
the adjudication of cancers. A cancer was considered to have occurred if the patient either had evidence of a new cancer 
or had the first recurrence (during the trial period) of a previous cancer.
¶  
Severe hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia for which the patient received medical assistance. This category in-
cluded all patients who had at least one event of severe hypoglycemia that was reported during the overall period, which 
was defined as the period from the date of randomization through the last date that the patient was known to be alive.
