IMPORTANCE This study is needed to clarify inconsistent findings regarding the association
between diabetes-related eye complications and psychological well-being.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and
diabetic macular edema (DME) with symptoms of depression and anxiety in adults with
diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary eye
hospital in Melbourne, Australia. The study comprised 519 participants with diabetes. The
median duration of diabetes was 13.0 (interquartile range, 14.0) years. The study was
conducted from March 1, 2009, to December 24, 2010.
EXPOSURES Patients underwent a comprehensive eye examination in which dilated fundus
photographs (disc and macula centered) were obtained and graded for the presence and
severity of DR and DME. Presenting distance uniocular and binocular visual acuity were
assessed using a 3-m logMAR chart.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Symptoms of depression and anxiety were measured using
the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which comprises 7 questions specific to
anxiety and 7 specific to depression with scores ranging from 0 to 21; scores higher than
8 signify possible anxiety or depression. The ordinal raw scores of the HADS questionnaire
were transformed to estimates of interval measure using Rasch analysis and evaluated as
continuous variables. Participants also completed standardized interview-administered
questionnaires. Blood samples were assessed for hemoglobin A1c, fasting blood glucose, and
serum lipids. Multiple linear regression models were used to determine the associations
between the severity of DR and DME with symptoms of anxiety and depression and
commonality analysis was used to quantify the unique variance explained.
RESULTS Of the 519 participants in the study, 170 individuals (32.8%) were female; mean (SD)
age was 64.9 (11.6) years. Raw scores indicated that 80 individuals (15.4%) screened positive
for depressive symptoms and 118 persons (22.7%) screened positive for symptoms of anxiety.
In multivariate analysis using Rasch scores, severe nonproliferative DR (NPDR)/PDR was
independently associated with greater depressive symptoms (regression coefficient
[β] = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.03-1.34) after controlling for sociodemographic factors and clinical
characteristics, including visual acuity. A history of depression or anxiety accounted for
60.6% (95% CI, 23.9%-83.2%) of the unique variance in depressive symptoms, and severe
NPDR or PDR contributed to 19.1% (95% CI, 1.7%-44.4%) of the total explained variance of
depressive symptoms. Diabetic macular edema was not associated with depressive
symptoms. No association between DR and symptoms of anxiety was identified.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Severe NPDR or PDR, but not DME, was independently
associated with depressive symptoms. The severity of DR could be an indicator to prompt
monitoring of depression in at-risk individuals with diabetes. Further work is required to
replicate these findings and determine the clinical significance of the association.

D
iabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular
complication of diabetes. It is a progressive eye dis-
ease that is characterized by an asymptomatic non-
proliferative stage (NPDR) and symptomatic proliferative stage
(PDR). The PDR stage, together with diabetic macular edema
(DME), which can develop at any stage, are the primary causes
ofvisionlossinpeoplewithdiabetes.1Diabeticretinopathyhas
an enormous effect on quality of life, particularly in the vision-
threatening stages,2 and qualitative work3 has highlighted
the profound emotional impact of DR, including feelings of
distress, anger, anxiety, and low mood. Systematic reviews4,5
have shown elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression in
people with diabetes. Moreover, rates of depression and anxi-
etyarehigherforthosewithcomplicationsfromdiabetes,such
as DR.6-8
Studiesinvestigatingtheassociationbetweenclinicalchar-
acteristics and psychological outcomes in DR are scarce; those
that have been conducted3 have small sample sizes and have
produced contradictory results. Even large cohort studies con-
tain relatively few participants with DR and do not include de-
tails on DR severity. Hence, our understanding of the psycho-
social impact of DR or DME across the spectrum of the disease
is limited and has been described as “almost entirely lacking
from the literature.”9(p1595)
Therefore, the purpose of our study was to examine the
association between DR and DME with psychological out-
comes in a sample of patients with diabetes recruited from a
specialized eye hospital in which the rates of diabetic eye dis-
eases are high. In particular, we examined the effect of clini-
cal characteristics, including DR/DME severity and visual acu-
ity loss, on symptoms of anxiety and depression.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
Our cross-sectional study was part of the Diabetes Manage-
ment Project (DMP), a large study of adults (aged >18 years)
with type 1 or 2 diabetes. Details of the methods of DMP have
been outlined previously.10 Briefly, participants with diabe-
tes were recruited from specialized eye clinics at the Royal Vic-
torian Eye and Ear Hospital from March 1, 2009, to December
24, 2010. Participants were eligible for the study if they were
English-speaking, free of significant hearing and cognitive im-
pairment, and living independently. They underwent a com-
prehensiveassessmentthatincludedclinical,biochemical,and
anthropometric measures as well as interviewer-adminis-
tered questionnaires. Each participant provided written in-
formed consent, and ethical approval for the DMP was pro-
vided by the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital Human
Research and Ethics Committee. Participants received finan-
cial compensation. The DMP protocol adhered to the tenets of
the Declaration of Helsinki.11
Assessment of Psychological Well-being
Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).12 The HADS com-
prises 14 questions: 7 specific to anxiety and 7 to depression.
A 4-point category scale (0-3) is used to measure partici-
pants’responses, with a total score of 21 possible for both
the anxiety and depression scales. Scores between 0 and 7
are considered normal, and scores higher than 8 signify a
possible clinical level of anxiety or depression requiring fur-
ther assessment.
Assessment of DR, DME, and Vision Impairment
Diabetic retinopathy was graded from 2-color, 45° nonstereo-
scopic fundus photographs, with 1 image centered on the op-
ticdiscand1centeredonthemacula(CanonCR6-45NM;Canon
Inc)followingthemodifiedAirlieHouseclassificationsystem13
by independent retinal graders. The severity of DR was cat-
egorized as no DR (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy
Study level 10-15), mild NPDR (level 20), moderate NPDR (level
31-43), severe NPDR (level 53-60), and PDR (level 61-80) using
the eye with the most severe grading. The DR categories were
then collapsed to no DR, mild or moderate NPDR, and severe
NPDR or PDR for analysis (frequency data on clinical charac-
teristicsacrossallcategoriesprovidedineTable1intheSupple-
ment). The presence of DME was confirmed using optical co-
herence tomography scans (Stratus; Ziess), with the severity
quantified by the measurement of the central macular thick-
ness. The severity of DME was classified using the American
Academy of Ophthalmology1 scale as no, mild, moderate, and
severe DME. For analysis, the mild and moderate DME cat-
egories were combined.
Presenting distance uniocular and binocular visual acu-
ity were assessed using a 3-m logMAR chart. We collapsed pre-
senting visual acuity (better eye) into 5 categories of vision im-
pairment: none (≤0.18 logMAR, ≤20/32 Snellen equivalent),
minimal(<0.18to0.3logMAR,<20/32to20/40Snellenequiva-
lent), mild (<0.3 to 0.48 logMAR, <20/40 to 20/63 Snellen
equivalent), moderate (<0.48 to 0.78 logMAR, <20/63 to 20/
125 Snellen equivalent), and severe (>0.78 logMAR, >20/125
Snellen equivalent) based on the distribution of the visual acu-
itydata.Foranalysis,visualacuitycategoriesminimalandmild
as well as moderate and severe were combined.
Assessment of Other Clinical Variables
A blood sample was collected via venipuncture, and fasting
plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein cho-
Key Points
Question What is the association between clinical characteristics
of diabetic retinopathy complications and symptoms of anxiety
and depression?
Findings In this cross-sectional study,a personal history of
depression or anxiety was associated with symptoms of anxiety or
depression. Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and moderate
or severe vision impairment were identified as independent risk
factors for increased depressive symptoms in people with
diabetes; an association of symptoms of anxiety with diabetic eye
disease was not identified.
Meaning The association of diabetic retinopathy with depressive
symptoms may warrant further studies to understand its
implications.

idelevelswereobtained.Bodymassindex(calculatedasweight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was mea-
sured using a wall-mounted scale, and weight was deter-
mined using a digital scientific weight scale. Systolic and dia-
stolic blood pressure was assessed using an automated blood
pressure machine.
Assessment of Other Risk Factors
Participants’sociodemographicdetails,comorbidities,anddia-
betic complications other than DR were obtained by self-
report. Key covariates included age (years); sex; educational
level; annual household income; marital status; smoking sta-
tus (nonsmoker, current, or past smoker); history of depres-
sion or anxiety (yes or no); presence of 1 or more comorbidi-
ties, including hypertension, myocardial infarction/angina,
arrhythmia,stroke,highcholesterollevel,asthma,anemia,mi-
graine, arthritis, and osteoporosis (yes or no), duration of dia-
betes (years); diabetes type; insulin use (yes or no); and pres-
ence of diabetic complications other than DR, including
nephropathy,peripheralvasculardisease,andneuropathy(yes
or no).
Rasch Analysis of the HADS
Rasch analysis14 was used to assess the psychometric proper-
ties of the anxiety and depression scales of the HADS using the
Andrich rating scale model with Winsteps software, version
3.75(http://www.winsteps.com/winsteps.htm).Raschanalysis
is a form of item response theory in which ordinal raw
questionnaire scores are transformed to estimates of interval
measures (expressed in log of the odds units or logits) for use
in subsequent parametric analyses.15 A high person measure
indicates that an individual possesses a high level of the
assessed latent trait (eg, depressive symptoms).16 Rasch
analysis also provides significant insight into the psychometric
propertiesofthescale,including(1)appropriateuseofresponse
categories; (2) measurement precision; (3) how well items fit
theunderlyingtrait;(4)unidimensionality;(5)targetingofitem
difficulty to patients’ability; (6) differential item functioning,
which occurs when subgroups of participants systematically
respond differently to a certain item despite having similar
underlying ability levels; and (7) person fit.16
Overall, fit to most Rasch model variables was adequate
for both the anxiety and depression HADS scales. Both scales
were unidimensional with no misfitting items and eigenval-
ues for the first contrast lower than 2.0. There was also no dif-
ferential item functioning for age, sex, diabetes type, or pres-
ence of DR vision impairment in either scale. However,
precision and targeting were suboptimal for both the depres-
sion and anxiety scales (person separation index <2.0 and dif-
ferencebetweenpersonanditemmeans>1.0logits),whichwas
a direct result of extreme and misfitting person responses.
When people obtain the maximum or minimum scores on an
instrument,theerroroftheirpersonmeasureisinfinite(ie,they
may have a much smaller or much greater ability than the most
difficult item in the scale; it cannot be determined). Someone
who is at the top limit of the scale and therefore has infinite
measurement error does not contribute to the computation of
measures as well as someone who does not have infinite
error.17 Highly misfitting persons, especially if there are
many, are also problematic since they may degrade measure-
ment and warp the person measures that are subsequently
computed.17 Therefore, it is standard procedure to remove
extreme and misfitting responses to optimize a scale’
s psy-
chometric properties if necessary.18,19 Several studies20,21
have demonstrated that, when questionnaires are optimized
to fit the Rasch measurement model, the increase in the rela-
tive precision of measurement, and thus the sensitivity to
detect associations, is substantial. Therefore, 61 persons with
extreme minimum scores and 25 misfitting persons (infit
mean square >2.0) were deleted from the depression scale,
and 49 persons with extreme minimum scores and 66 misfit-
ting persons were deleted from the anxiety scale. This adjust-
ment substantially improved precision and targeting for both
HADS scales.
Once fit to the Rasch model was achieved, we exported the
personmeasuresforanxietyanddepressionthatrangedacross
a negative to positive logit scale. Because interpretation of
negative and positive logit scores is challenging, person mea-
sures were subsequently converted to a scale with scores from
0 to 10 logits to ease interpretation of the results. High scores
represent greater symptoms of anxiety and depression. How-
ever, these scores are still interval-scaled Rasch scores and are
not equivalent to 0 to 10 on a raw score scale.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptivestatisticswerecomputedandnormalityofthevari-
ableswasexaminedusingboxplots,Kolmogorov-Smirnov,and
Shapiro-Wilks tests. The linearity of nominal and ordinal data
was assessed using χ2-based measures. Symptoms of depres-
sion and anxiety, as measured by Rasch person measures of
the 2 HADS scales, were the main outcomes and were ana-
lyzed as continuous variables. Factors associated with symp-
toms of depression or anxiety (P < .10) in univariate analysis
were examined using a multivariable linear regression model
controlling for several demographic, clinical, and psychoso-
cial variables. A plot of the residuals compared with esti-
mates was examined to determine whether the assumptions
of linearity and homoscedasticity were met. We used 4 rel-
evant criteria for evaluating linear regression models: ad-
justed R2, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Akaike cor-
rected information criterion (AICc), and Bayesian information
criterion. Generally, higher variance explained by the model
(adjusted R2) and lower AIC, AICc, and Bayesian information
criterion values indicate the best-fitting model. We used the
Stata program vselect to perform variable selection after per-
forming linear regression.22 All statistical analyses were con-
ducted with Stata, version 12.1.0 (StataCorp).
The relative importance of the risk factors was deter-
mined using the percentages of unique variance explained.
Commonality analysis quantifies the percentage of variance
that is unique to each risk factor, and the percentage is com-
mon to all of the possible combinations of risk factors. Unique
effects reflect how much variance a risk factor independently
contributes to the outcome that is not shared with the other
risk factors. The variables that were significant in the final re-

Results
Of the 609 participants in the DMP study, we excluded those
whowerecurrentlytakingmedicationfordepressionandanxi-
ety (n = 55) and who did not complete the HADS (n = 35). The
full data set of participants (519, with 170 [32.8% women]) had
a mean (SD) age of 64.9 (11.6) years and most had type 2 dia-
betes (433 [83.4%]) (Table 1). A total of 310 patients (59.7%) had
DR, 149 individuals (28.7%) had DME, and 262 participants
(50.5%) had some loss of visual acuity. A total of 445 partici-
pants (85.7%) reported comorbidities (eg, hypertension or
stroke) and 165 individuals (31.8%) reported diabetes compli-
cation in addition to DR (ie, nephropathy, peripheral vascular
disease, or neuropathy). According to their raw HADS scores,
80 patients (15.4%) screened positive for depressive symp-
toms and 118 persons (22.7%) screened positive for symp-
toms of anxiety (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Removal of ex-
treme minimum and misfitting cases resulted in a total sample
of 433 and 404 participants for the depression and anxiety
scales, respectively. Compared with patients who were re-
tainedintheanalysisfordepressivesymptoms,thosewhowere
excluded were more likely to be male (88 of 115 [76.5%];
P = .02). There were comparable DR severity levels between
those excluded and included in the analysis of Rasch depres-
sion scores (eTable 3 in the Supplement). For the anxiety scale,
those who were excluded were less likely to be using insulin
(25 of 86 [29.1%]) than those who remained in the analysis (193
of 430 [44.9%]; P = .02). The mean (SD) diastolic blood pres-
sure was also lower in participants excluded from (74.2 [9.4])
compared with those who remained (76.5 [8.8]) (P = .03) in the
sample for analysis.

with depressive symptoms (Table 3, models 1 and 2). Com-
monality analysis showed that a history of depression or anxi-
ety accounted for 60.6% (95% CI, 23.9%-83.2%) of the unique
variance in depressive symptoms; having severe NPDR or PDR,
19.1% (95% CI, 1.7%-44.4%); moderate or severe vision im-
pairment, 15.8% (95% CI, 1.0%-44.2%); minimal or mild vi-
sionimpairment,2.7%(95%CI,0.4%-20.0%);andmildormod-
erateDR,1.8%(95%CI,0.7%-14.5%).Withtheuseofrawcutoff
points from the full sample, history of depression was the only
independent factor significantly associated with depressive
symptoms (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Personal history of depression or anxiety was indepen-
dently associated with symptoms of anxiety (β = 1.45; 95% CI,
0.82 to 2.08; P < .001) as was younger age (β = −0.02; 95% CI,
−0.04 to −0.002; P < .05) (Table 4, models 1 and 2). In model
1, presence of comorbidity (β = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.12 to 1.33;
P = .02) was also associated with heightened anxiety.
Discussion
The findings of our study demonstrate that severe NPDR or
PDR and moderate or severe vision impairment, but not
DME, were independent risk factors for depressive symp-
toms in people with diabetes. Having a self-reported history
of depression or anxiety was consistently associated with
heightened psychological symptoms in this sample of indi-
viduals with diabetes and the most important risk factor for
depressive symptoms.
Our findings support previous studies that have identi-
fied a link between diabetic complications6,24 and vision
impairment25,26 with depressive symptoms. The findings
presented here highlight that the severity of DR heightens
the risk of depressive symptoms independent from the pres-
ence or degree of vision impairment and duration of diabe-
tes. This association likely reflects the long-term burden of
managing and coping with DR in its advanced stages.
Advanced DR has been shown27 to negatively affect social
life, family and community roles, work, finance, and per-
sonal relationships as well as generate treatment concerns.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that has examined
the association between DME and psychological well-being.
Our findings are in line with those of a recent study28 that
found that, in individuals with type 2 diabetes, the presence
and severity of DR, but not DME, was related to a lower
diabetes-specific quality of life. Diabetic macular edema was
associated with lower treatment satisfaction.28
Consistent with mental health research in diabetes and
other conditions, previous depression was the strongest indi-
cator of depressive symptoms.29,30 The association between
depressive symptoms, diabetes, and DR is likely to be bidirec-
tional; the impairment and burden of diabetes and its compli-
cations can precipitate depression and vice versa, and depres-
sioncanimpairdiabetescontrolthroughvariousbiologicaland
behavioral pathways.31,32 Qualitative research3 has found that
patients with DR report fear, anxiety, and stress; however, an
association between DR or DME and anxiety was not ob-
served in our study. Rather, anxiety was associated with
factors known to contribute to anxiety in the general popula-
tion, including a personal history of anxiety, medical comor-
bidity, and younger age.29 The fact that older age may be pro-
tective against anxiety supports previous research in
diabetes8,33 and the aging literature34 more widely, which sug-
gests that older age may infer greater coping ability.
Strengths of our study include the large sample of indi-
viduals with different stages of DR and our detailed clinical as-
sessmentofDRstatusandvisualacuity.OuruseofRaschanaly-
sistoconvertordinalHADSscorestointerval-leveldataensured
our findings were robust. However, Rasch scores are more dif-
ficult to interpret than raw scores and statistical significance
may not reflect clinical relevance since we do not know how
the Rasch transformation applies to the definitions of anxi-
ety and depression from the raw HADS scoring. Moreover, a

bias into the analysis. Although no systematic differences in
DRseveritywerefoundinparticipantsexcludedfromtheanaly-
sis, those removed to optimize scale precision were critical in
determining the association between DR and depression. Fur-
thermore, given that our main finding on the association be-
tween severe DR and depressive symptoms was not identi-
fied in analysis of the raw scores and cutoff points, further
replication of these results with Rasch-transformed scores is
required. A further limitation of our study is that current psy-
chological symptoms and history were based on self-report
data;aclinicalassessmentordiagnosticinterviewwasnotcon-
ducted.Despitetheseshortcomings,ourfindingshighlightthat
a simple self-report question about mental health history,
which is feasible to implement in clinical practice, with rec-
ords of vision and DR status can be used to identify individu-
als with diabetes who are at risk for poor mental health.

Conclusions
Vision-threatening stages of DR, but not DME, are associated
with higher levels of depressive symptoms. This finding is in-
dependent from known risk factors of a history of anxiety or
depression and vision impairment. The severity and progres-
sion of DR may be a useful indicator to prompt assessment of
psychologicalwell-being,particularlyinindividualswithother
risk factors.
