Abstract
Background
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of disability and mortality in children and
young adults worldwide. It remains unclear, however, how TBI in childhood and adoles-
cence is associated with adult mortality, psychiatric morbidity, and social outcomes.
Methods and Findings
In a Swedish birth cohort between 1973 and 1985 of 1,143,470 individuals, we identified all
those who had sustained at least one TBI (n = 104,290 or 9.1%) up to age 25 y and their
unaffected siblings (n = 68,268) using patient registers. We subsequently assessed these
individuals for the following outcomes using multiple national registries: disability pension,
specialist diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric inpatient hospitalisation, pre-
mature mortality (before age 41 y), low educational attainment (not having achieved sec-
ondary school qualifications), and receiving means-tested welfare benefits. We used
logistic and Cox regression models to quantify the association between TBI and specified
adverse outcomes on the individual level. We further estimated population attributable
fractions (PAF) for each outcome measure. We also compared differentially exposed sib-
lings to account for unobserved genetic and environmental confounding. In addition to
relative risk estimates, we examined absolute risks by calculating prevalence and Kaplan-
Meier estimates. In complementary analyses, we tested whether the findings were moder-
ated by injury severity, recurrence, and age at first injury (ages 0–4, 5–9, 6–10, 15–19, and
20–24 y).

 TBI exposure was associated with elevated risks of impaired adult functioning across all
outcome measures. After a median follow-up period of 8 y from age 26 y, we found that TBI
contributed to absolute risks of over 10% for specialist diagnoses of psychiatric disorders
and low educational attainment, approximately 5% for disability pension, and 2% for prema-
ture mortality. The highest relative risks, adjusted for sex, birth year, and birth order, were
found for psychiatric inpatient hospitalisation (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 2.0; 95% CI:
1.9–2.0; 6,632 versus 37,095 events), disability pension (aRR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.7–1.8; 4,691
versus 29,778 events), and premature mortality (aRR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.6–1.9; 799 versus
4,695 events). These risks were only marginally attenuated when the comparisons were
made with their unaffected siblings, which implies that the effects of TBI were consistent
with a causal inference. A dose-response relationship was observed with injury severity.
Injury recurrence was also associated with higher risks—in particular, for disability pension
we found that recurrent TBI was associated with a 3-fold risk increase (aRR = 2.6; 95% CI:
2.4–2.8) compared to a single-episode TBI. Higher risks for all outcomes were observed for
those who had sustained their first injury at an older age (ages 20–24 y) with more than
25% increase in relative risk across all outcomes compared to the youngest age group
(ages 0–4 y). On the population level, TBI explained between 2%–6% of the variance in the
examined outcomes.
Using hospital data underestimates milder forms of TBI, but such misclassification bias
suggests that the reported estimates are likely conservative. The sibling-comparison design
accounts for unmeasured familial confounders shared by siblings, including half of their
genes. Thus, residual genetic confounding remains a possibility but will unlikely alter our
main findings, as associations were only marginally attenuated within families.
Conclusions
Given our findings, which indicate potentially causal effects between TBI exposure in child-
hood and later impairments across a range of health and social outcomes, age-sensitive
clinical guidelines should be considered and preventive strategies should be targeted at
children and adolescents.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Traumatic brain injury (TBI) constitutes the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
individuals under the age of 45 y globally.
• Research on the long-term effects of TBI is limited to more severe injuries and medical
outcomes.
• There is uncertainty whether children and adolescents experiencing milder forms of TBI
may have significant medical and social problems in adulthood.

 What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• We used national registers in Sweden covering 1.1 million individuals born between
1973–1985
• In the 9.1% who sustained at least one TBI before the age of 25 y, we examined later risk
of six medical and social outcomes.
• We compared TBI patients with their unaffected siblings in order to account for the pos-
sibility that the risk for these outcomes runs in families.
• We found TBI consistently predicted later risk of premature mortality, psychiatric inpa-
tient admission, psychiatric outpatient visits, disability pension, welfare recipiency, and
low educational attainment in the sibling-comparison analyses, and the effects were
stronger for those with greater injury severity, recurrence, and older age at first injury.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• Consideration needs to be given to review the cognitive, psychiatric, and social develop-
ment all children and adolescents who sustain head injuries.
• Guidelines should consider age-specific recommendations for follow-up.
• The public health benefits of preventing TBIs should include social outcomes.
Introduction
The World Health Organization ranks traumatic brain injury (TBI) as the leading cause of
both disability and mortality in individuals below the age of 45 y [1]. Conservative estimates
from the United States indicate that TBI accounts for an annual combined average of approxi-
mately 848,000 hospital admissions and emergency room visits in individuals under the age of
25 y, the majority of which classified as concussions or mild TBI [2]. In England and Wales, it
is estimated that between 462,200 and 700,000 children under 15 y of age attend emergency
departments annually with head injury [3]. Similar findings have been reported in other high-
income countries [4–6].
Epidemiological studies have consistently found higher rates of adverse outcomes in adults
who have sustained a TBI when compared to the general population [7–16]. However, there is
a lack of large-scale studies that have examined the potential long-term impact of TBI exposure
during childhood and adolescence. Importantly, there is a gap in the literature identifying how
injury characteristics (e.g., severity, recurrence, and developmental timing) might moderate
such associations. Previous work suggests that TBI in children contributes to poorer measures
of emotion perception and social interaction [17,18], employment, and quality of life [19,20].
Nevertheless, uncertainty remains as to how early TBI exposure is related to a broader set of
specific medical and social functioning outcomes in adulthood [10,21,22], such as premature
mortality, disability pension, and educational attainment. Some of this uncertainty is attributed
to small and selected clinical samples, poor adjustments for confounding factors, and non-spe-
cific outcomes that measure global disabilities.

 Therefore, we have used population-based registers of the entire Swedish population born
between 1973 and 1982 to examine how exposure to a TBI from birth up to age 25 y is associ-
ated with functioning in adulthood. These datasets have allowed us to examine the extent to
which injury severity and recurrent injuries predict a range of long-term outcomes. Injuries to
the brain during developmentally sensitive periods may be particularly problematic [23,24].
We have also separately considered the associations between TBI experienced during different
developmental stages during childhood and adolescence and the adverse functioning outcomes
in adulthood. A unique feature of this study is the use of the sibling-comparison design [25].
This has been adopted in previous Swedish studies [8,16] and allows one to account for unob-
served familial (e.g., genetic and environmental) confounders. This is important because previ-
ous research has demonstrated that indicators of medical and social functioning are
considerably heritable [26–28]. By comparing differentially exposed siblings, we were able to
account for an aggregate of their shared genetic and environmental risks, which allowed us to
estimate more accurate estimates of the consequences of early TBI exposure.
Methods
Swedish Nationwide Registers
This study was approved by the Regional Research Ethics Committee in Stockholm (RRECiS;
2013/5:8). Statistics Sweden, an independent governmental agency, maintains a number of
nationwide longitudinal registries with routinely gathered governmental agency data. A ten-
digit civic registration number assigned to all Swedish residents enables them to merge all of
these registers. Following the approval from the RRECiS, we were given access to anonymised
data.
The Total Population/Multi-Generation Register (TPR/MGR; 1932–2014) linked all Swed-
ish residents to their biological parents, allowing us to identify all biological full siblings. Emi-
gration and mortality dates were derived from the Migration and the Causes of Death Registers
(1973–2014), respectively. The National Patient Register provided data on inpatient care
(based on International Classification of Diseases eighth, ninth, and tenth editions [ICD-8,
ICD-9 and ICD-10] codes; 1973–2013) and outpatient care (ICD-10; 2001–2013). Parental
criminal convictions were gathered from the National Crime Register, which includes all crimi-
nal convictions in lower general court in Sweden (1973–2013). Annual sociodemographic data
were derived from the following census registers covering all Swedish residents who were alive
at the end of each year: the Education Register (1985–2012), the Population and Housing Reg-
ister (1985), and the Integrated Database for Labour Market Research (LISA; 1990–2012).
Sample
Our initial sample included all Swedish children born between 1973 and 1985 (n = 1,333,919).
In the following order, we excluded those who could not be linked to both of their biological
parents (n = 63,018), had died (n = 16,806) or had migrated (n = 95,327) before the age of 26 y,
as well as those who lacked data on parental sociodemographic factors (n = 3,427) and adult-
hood outcome measures (n = 11,871). The final sample therefore consisted of 1,143,470 chil-
dren with complete data, of which 683,860 had at least one biological full-sibling. We found no
evidence of non-random selection effects in the excluded sample (S1 Text).
Measures
Definition of TBI. We defined an individual who had sought treatment for at least one
episode of a concussion (mild TBI) or a moderate-to-severe TBI before 25 y of age as a TBI

 patient. The patients were diagnosed in specialist care according to ICD-criteria (see S1 Table).
Mild TBI diagnoses recorded in the Swedish National Patient Register have demonstrated
excellent validity (positive predictive value = 100%; negative predictive value = 99.8%) [29].
Similar results have also been found for unintentional injuries [30]. To examine the effects of
injury severity, we also generated separate measures for mild TBI and moderate to severe TBI.
Individuals who had sustained a mild and a moderate-to-severe TBI were only included in the
omnibus TBI measure. We defined recurrence as two or more episodes of TBI. To avoid bias
resulting from duplicate records of the same episode in the registries, we excluded episodes
that had occurred within 15 d of one another.
We examined developmentally sensitive periods by stratifying the group of TBI patients
according to their age at first injury using the same age categories as the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [2], namely 0–4 y, 5–9 y, 10–14 y, 15–19 y, and 20–24 y. To investigate
whether our findings were specific to TBI or to a general proneness to injury, we additionally
examined a group of individuals who had been through at least one episode of fall-related
injury but who had not been diagnosed with a TBI in a sensitivity test.
Outcomes.
Six outcome variables that assessed specific dimensions of both medical and
social functioning were examined. The baseline of the study started during the year that the
individuals turned 26 y of age and we followed them in the registers until they experienced the
outcome, migrated, died, or exited the study (e.g., the end of 2012–2014 depending on the out-
come of interest). “Disability pension” measured whether the individual was in receipt of dis-
ability pension (covering up to 65% of lost wages) due to permanent work incapacity [31].
“Psychiatric visit” or “psychiatric hospitalisation” measured whether the individual had visited
an outpatient clinic or been admitted to inpatient care for any psychiatric diagnosis. “Prema-
ture mortality” indicated whether the individual had died before a maximum age of 41 y. “Low
educational level” indicated that the highest achieved attainment did not meet secondary
school qualifications as defined by the SUN2000 classification system [32], at the baseline of
the follow-up (age 26 y). “Welfare recipiency” indicated whether the individual had received
means-tested welfare benefits [33].
Covariates.
The TPR provided information on sex, birth year (continuous), and birth
order (first, second, third, and fourth or higher). Parental lifetime history of psychiatric mor-
bidity and criminality were measured as binary variables, indicating whether either biological
parent of the individuals had been diagnosed for any psychiatric disorder or convicted of a
criminal offence. We measured parental sociodemographic factors in 1985. If the information
was missing, we used the earliest available information up until 2012. “Family income” was
defined as the disposable income, which includes both earnings and benefits, averaged across
both biological parents. “Low parental education level” measured whether neither biological
parent had achieved secondary school qualifications. “Maternal single status” indicated that
the mother was not married.
Analytical Approach
We initially generated descriptive statistics to examine how sociodemographic characteristics
were distributed across TBI exposure groups with varying degrees of injury severity.
We then estimated the magnitude of the associations between TBI and the functional out-
comes of interest by fitting a series of logistic and Cox regression models that accommodated
the binary and right-censored outcome distributions. A total of 42,132 individuals had emi-
grated and 5,494 individuals had died during the follow-up period and were right-censored.
Time at risk was, therefore, explicitly accounted for in the Cox regression model. We will
henceforth refer to the effect measures (e.g., odds and hazard ratios) as risk ratios. We

 gradually accounted for a number of measured covariates by fitting two separate models to the
full sample (n = 1,143,470). In these analyses, we assumed that all individuals were unrelated to
one another. In Model I, we only adjusted for sex, birth year, and birth order. Model II addi-
tionally adjusted for individual and parental educational level, parental lifetime history of psy-
chiatric morbidity and criminality, family income, as well as maternal single status. In Model
III, we further tested for the contribution of unobserved familial confounders by fitting a sib-
ling-comparison model to the sibling subsample (n = 683,860) using fixed-effects estimators
[34] of the statistical models described above, which stratified the estimates across clusters of
biological parents.
The rationale for Model III was to compare risks of poor adulthood functioning in differen-
tially exposed full-siblings (i.e., one sibling has sustained a TBI and the other one has not;
n = 108,086) and thereby indirectly control for an aggregate of factors that make the siblings
similar to one another (e.g., 50% of their co-segregating genes and their shared childhood envi-
ronments). This implies that Model III indirectly accounted for all of the measured family-
wide covariates (e.g., family income and maternal single status) in Model II, as they are con-
stant between siblings. Under these assumptions, Model III isolated the residual effect of the
association of interest, which is consistent with a causal inference [25]. The magnitude of famil-
ial confounding is measured as the relative attenuation of the within-family estimate compared
to the unrelated population estimate [35]. We followed the STROBE guidelines for cohort stud-
ies (see S1 STROBE Checklist for details).
Sensitivity analyses. We re-fitted Models I–III to non-TBI fall-related injury to examine
whether the findings were specific to TBI or to a general proneness to injury. To examine
whether recurrent TBIs was a stronger risk factor than a single-episode TBI, we re-specified
Models I–III so that we compared individuals who had sustained recurrent TBIs with those
who had sustained a single TBI, rather than those who had not sustained any TBIs. By defini-
tion, this implies that Model III examined the relative risk differences between siblings that
were differentially exposed to either recurrent TBIs and single TBI. We explored potential
moderation effects by age at first TBI by re-fitting Models I–III to the five age category mea-
sures. To maximise statistical power in these analyses for premature mortality, we defined the
baseline of the follow-up at the end of each exposure period (e.g., at ages 4, 9, 14, 19, and 24 y).
We were asked to conduct the following complementary sensitivity analyses during the peer
review process: We tested whether our findings could be explained by any comorbid psychiat-
ric and/or neurological conditions that had occurred at any time throughout the exposure
period, up to the age of 25 y, by re-running Models I–III on a subsample that excluded individ-
uals who met such criteria (n = 83,897). To explore time trends, we tested whether the birth
year moderated the effects of TBI on the outcomes by adding an interaction term to Model III.
We also considered whether the correlated nature of our outcome measures (correlation table
presented in S2 Table) could impact on the presented findings by comparing the Model I esti-
mates to equivalent estimates derived from a multivariate structural equation model (SEM),
where all of the associations were tested jointly. In the SEM, we specified the right-censored
outcome variables to be treated as Poisson distributed counts with offset variables, which
allowed us to explicitly take time at risk into account. We also calculated population attribut-
able fractions (PAF), or the relative share of the outcomes that could be attributed to TBI. Simi-
lar to the individual-level analyses described above, we gradually accounted for confounding
factors using the Models I–III specifications.
We used Stata 14 MP [36] to fit the logistic regression (logit), conditional logistic regression
(xtlogit, fe), Cox regression (stcox), stratified Cox regression (stcox, strata()), and multivariate
SEM (gsem) models, as well as to estimate PAFs (punafcc) for Models I and II. We used the AF
0.1.1 package [37] in R 3.2.2 [38] to estimate PAFs for Model III.

 Results
We identified 104,290 (9.1%) individuals that had sustained a TBI before age 25 y (Table 1).
The overwhelming majority of these persons had suffered from mild TBIs (n = 80,676; 77.4%)
and one in eight (n = 12,680; 12.2%) had experienced recurrent injuries. People with head inju-
ries were, on average, more likely to be male and to have grown up in households characterised
by a range of adverse psychosocial indicators (Table 1). Individuals who had sustained recur-
rent TBIs were, on average, approximately 2 y younger at their first injury than those who had
sustained a single TBI (12.0 versus 13.8 y). Those who had sustained mild TBIs also tended to
be younger at the time of their first injury than those who had sustained moderate to severe
TBIs (12.2 versus 19.2 y).
TBI was associated with elevated risk of impaired adult functioning across all outcome
measures (Fig 1; Table 1; complete list of absolute risks in S3 Table). Sustaining a TBI contrib-
uted to absolute risks of over 10% for specialist diagnoses of psychiatric disorders, low educa-
tional attainment, and welfare recipiency, and approximately 6% for disability pension. In
terms of relative risks (Table 2), we found that the risk of disability pension increased by 76%
(RR = 1.76; 95% CI: 1.71–1.82), which reduced to 49% (RR = 1.49; 1.38–1.60) when the com-
parison was made with unaffected siblings. The strongest association was found for psychiatric
inpatient hospitalisation, for which the risk was doubled (RR = 1.95; 1.90–2.10). When com-
pared to their unaffected siblings, TBI patients continued to be nearly 60% (RR = 1.57; 95% CI:
1.47–1.67) more likely to be hospitalised for any psychiatric disorder. Social functioning
impairments were also more common in those who had sustained a TBI, being 60% more likely

results were observed for receiving welfare benefits. These findings could not be attributed to
comorbid psychiatric and/or neurological conditions throughout the exposure period (S4

also commensurate with these findings (Table 3). Furthermore, we did not find any statistically

 significant (p < 0.05) moderation effects by birth year, thus suggesting that the effects of TBI
on the outcomes did not change materially over time.
We found that the crude population contributions of TBI explained approximately 4%–7%
of the differences in the outcome measures (Table 4; Model I). These estimates were partially
attenuated once familial confounders were accounted for (Model III) but remained statistically
significant, explaining between 2%–6% of the population differences in the outcomes. The
strongest population attributable risks were found for the severe outcomes, including psychiat-
ric inpatient hospitalisation (PAF = 5.5%; 4.9%–6.1%), premature mortality (PAF = 4.7%;
2.9%–6.5%), and disability pension (PAF = 4.6%; 3.8%–5.3%).
Individuals that had sustained non-TBI fall injuries were generally less likely than those
who had sustained a TBI to have poor adulthood outcomes (Table 5). The differences were
most noticeable for severe outcomes, such as disability pension, for which the risk increase for
non-TBI patients compared to their unaffected siblings (RR = 1.01; 0.91–1.12) was less than
the equivalent risk estimate for TBI patients (RR = 1.49; 1.38–1.60). We also found similar
results for premature mortality.
Stratifying the TBI exposure across injury severity (Table 5), we found that the estimates of
mild TBI exposure were only slightly attenuated compared to the TBI estimates. Importantly,
we observed that moderate-to-severe TBI was a stronger risk factor for all functioning out-
comes. This was particularly evident in the case of premature mortality, for which moderate-

 to-severe TBI patients had an approximately 2-fold increase in risk compared to both unrelated
controls (RR = 2.26; 1.95–2.61) and their unaffected siblings (RR = 1.92; 1.34–2.74). We found
similar results for disability pension and psychiatric inpatient hospitalisation.
The risks of poor functioning in adulthood were substantially elevated across all outcomes
in individuals who had suffered recurrent TBIs compared to those who had suffered a single
TBI (Table 6). Recurrent TBI was, for instance, associated with a nearly 3-fold increase in risk
of being in receipt of disability pension (RR = 2.58; 2.41–2.76) compared to unrelated controls
that had sustained a single TBI and a 2-fold increase in risk compared to their siblings that had
sustained a single TBI (RR = 2.22; 1.88–2.63). Similarly, we observed that the risks of psychiat-
ric inpatient hospitalisation (RR = 1.84; 1.73–1.95) and premature mortality (RR = 2.11; 1.78–
2.49) were doubled in individuals with recurrent injuries compared to those who had suffered
a single TBI. These increases in risk persisted in the sibling-comparison models for both psy-
chiatric inpatient hospitalisation (RR = 1.53; 1.31–1.79) and premature mortality (RR = 1.59;
1.02–2.49). Further stratification of the recurrence effects across injury severity revealed that
individuals who had sustained multiple moderate to severe TBIs had a 6-fold increase in risk of
being in receipt of disability pension (RR = 5.84; 5.17–6.60) when compared to population con-
trols who were exposed to a single moderate-to-severe TBI, which persisted when further

 compared with their siblings who were similarly exposed to a single moderate-to-severe TBI
(RR = 6.13; 4.18–8.99).
The age at first TBI was a very strong moderator of poor functioning in adulthood (Table 7;
Model III findings in S5 Table). We observed a positive association between older age at first
TBI and all outcomes, and in particular among those who sustained their first injury after the
age of 15 y. The largest observed differences were found for psychiatric inpatient hospitalisa-
tion, for which the first TBI exposure between ages 0–4 y was associated with a 1.2 fold
(RR = 1.24; 1.15–1.34) increased risk, while the equivalent estimate for ages 20–24 y was a
2.5-fold risk increase (RR = 2.47; 2.37–2.58). In complementary sensitivity analyses, we repli-
cated these findings for mild TBI (S6 Table), which suggests that these findings could not be
attributed to increased injury severity among those who sustained their first injury at an older
age.
Discussion

associations between TBI exposure, identified from inpatient and outpatient episodes, from
birth up to age 25, and a range of adverse adult medical and social outcomes with public health

 implications. We followed the sample for up to 41 y, examined 683,860 siblings in addition to
population controls, and the investigation was sufficiently powered to reliably explore the
moderating effects of age categories at first injury. There were five principal findings. First, we
found that being exposed to a mild TBI was associated with a range of adverse outcomes,
including disability pension, psychiatric visits and inpatient hospitalisation, premature mortal-
ity, low educational attainment, and welfare recipiency. To provide more accurate estimates,
we used unaffected siblings as comparisons, which demonstrated that although there was some
familial confounding (shared genetic and childhood family environmental risks), we found
that mild TBI was associated with 18%–52% increased risk of these outcomes. In particular, the
risks were highest for psychiatric inpatient hospitalisation and disability pension.
Second, we found that greater injury severity was associated with poorer functioning out-
comes. Compared to mild TBI, exposure to moderate-to-severe TBI increased the risk of dis-
ability pension by 106% and of psychiatric inpatient hospitalisation by 92% when compared to
their unaffected siblings. Importantly, we observed smaller differences between the population
and sibling-comparison estimates (Model I and III) in the case of moderate-to-severe TBI com-
pared to mild TBI, which provides additional evidence for a potentially causal effect of more
severe TBI on adverse outcomes.
The third main finding was that recurrent TBIs led to poorer outcomes than a single TBI.
This was most noticeable for the likelihood of receiving disability pension, for which the risk
increase between differentially exposed siblings was around 2-fold for recurrent TBIs com-
pared to a single TBI. One in eleven (n = 1,139; 9.0%) individuals who sustained recurrent
TBIs went on to receive a disability pension, which is 759 individuals more than we would have
expected. This risk increase is associated with a substantial economic impact. The per person
average cost of productivity loss for a single day of work absence in Sweden is estimated to be
US$190 [39]. If we assume that these 759 individuals are absent from the labour market for a
period of 30 y, this would roughly translate to a cumulative cost of US$1.3 million per person
or US$987 million in total for productivity losses alone over the same time period. Generalising
this to the US setting, with an annual 848,000 TBI patients under the age of 25 y [2], we would
expect 34,600 of these individuals to be at risk for permanent labour market exclusion, equating
to approximately US$1.1 trillion.
Fourth, we found that TBI accounted for between 2%–6% of the differences in the adverse
outcomes following adjustments for familial confounders shared by differentially exposed sib-
lings. These estimates are not insignificant. By way of comparison, the population attributable
risk of severe mental illnesses on violent criminal convictions in Sweden has been estimated at
5% [40]. Importantly, as the examples presented above demonstrate, successful prevention
efforts targeting high-risk individuals may have a notable impact on health care and other
costs.

 Fifth, we found that age at first head injury moderated the effects on long-term outcome.
There was an age-related association in which older age at first head injury, and particularly
after the age of 15 y, substantially increased the risks of all examined outcomes. In the case of
premature mortality, we further minimised the risks of survival bias by initiating the follow-up
period at the end of each exposure period. This approach thus allowed us to include individuals
who had died before age 26. Although in need of replication, our findings are perhaps consis-
tent with the hypothesis that neuroplasticity in early life may have long-term protective effects.
These effects were most noticeable in relation to psychiatric hospitalisation for which the risk
was substantially less among those who had sustained their first TBI between ages 0–4 y
(RR = 1.24; 1.15–1.34) compared to those who had sustained their first injury between ages
20–24 y (RR = 2.47; 2.37–2.58). The neuroplasticity literature is currently mixed and inconclu-
sive, largely due to similar methodological limitations as those outlined above [41–43]. Our
robust findings, however, cannot be explained by differential injury levels, injury proneness
across the examined age groups, survival bias, or familial selection factors. Importantly, our
findings suggest that current clinical guidelines [3] should be revised to explicitly offer age-sen-
sitive recommendations for follow-up interventions in childhood, adolescence, and early
adulthood.
Two main findings—that TBI was associated with subsequent adverse adulthood outcomes,
and the dose-response relationship with injury severity—are consistent with previous research
[17–20,44], although these studies have mostly focused on small and selected samples that rely
extensively on self-reported data either from (severely) injured patients or their caregivers; an
approach subject to substantial bias [45]. Similar results have been reported in studies examin-
ing global disability indices [10], such as the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) [21].
Our third finding, on the effects of recurrent injuries, is broadly consistent with the emerging
literature on the adverse consequences of sports and combat-related neurotrauma [7,9,11–
14,46–49]. Although replication of this research is needed with larger samples of athletes and
using research designs, such as comparisons with sibling controls, that account for confound-
ing factors, our findings suggest that recurrent neurotrauma in any setting may be a causal risk
factor for a wide range of social, cognitive, and medical adverse outcomes.
One of the implications of these findings is the importance of developing preventive inter-
ventions for early exposure to head injuries. In toddlers and preschoolers, these interventions
should ideally be targeting improved parental supervision, as falling is the most common cause
of TBI in this group. Prevention of sports-related concussions in older children could focus on
changes to rules so that the risks of players colliding their heads with each other and with
equipment (e.g., heading soccer balls or getting hit in the head by a racket, bat, or stick) [50] is
reduced. A recent systematic review indicated that helmet use in most sports is generally asso-
ciated with reduced risks for severe head injuries but not for concussions/mild TBI [51]. The
development of safer helmets should also be prioritised as, for instance, recent evaluations of
American football helmets report performance differences [52]. A further implication of the
current study is that individuals who have suffered serious injuries should receive close follow-
up interventions beyond medical care. This holds especially true if the injuries are recurrent or
have occurred for the first time after the age of 20 y. The involvement of social services and
work training opportunities may mitigate a potential downward social drift.
Our study has significant strengths that include (1) a very large sample size, enabling precise
measures of associations between early TBI exposure and objectively defined indicators of
medical and social functioning during adulthood to be defined; (2) the high quality of registers
allowed selection bias to a minimum, as we were able to retain 86% of the targeted sample
across 41 y of follow-up; and (3) the family-based research design allowed us to robustly test
for the aggregated effects of all pre-injury and other selection characteristics shared within the

 family. Two limitations should be noted: We will have underestimated the prevalence of mild
TBI. We used the National Patient Register, as adopted by previous studies [8,15,16], to ascer-
tain TBI cases. This allowed comprehensive information on all individuals who sought medical
treatment for their injuries, but will have underestimated milder forms of TBI, for example of
the type prevalent in sports-related injuries [53–56]. This will not likely affect our main conclu-
sions, as misclassifying head injured individuals as unaffected will have led to an underestima-
tion of the presented associations, assuming that the effects of diagnosed and undiagnosed TBI
on the outcomes are similar in magnitude. A co-twin design might better account for residual
genetic confounds, but we were underpowered to do so, as it would require monozygotic twins
that are discordant on head injuries, which would lead to considerably wider confidence inter-
vals than traditional approaches [25].
The generalisability of our findings is an important consideration, and there is evidence that
Sweden is similar to other high-income countries in terms of the key exposures and outcomes
in this study. A recent systematic review [57] of annual TBI incidence rates for individuals up
to age 20 y identified three studies from the US and New Zealand with a median estimate of
973 [range: 790–1,652] injuries per 100,000 population. We calculated equivalent estimates for
Sweden between 2001 and 2009 and observed a median of 1,220 (range: 931–1,262) injuries
per 100,000 population. Sweden’s employment rate (74.2%) was comparable to that of the
United Kingdom (70.5%) and the US (67.3%) in 2013 [58]. The estimated life expectancy in
Sweden is similar to that of other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) countries [59], and a systematic review of the rates of mental disorders in Western
European countries found no material country differences [60].
Children and adolescents who are exposed to TBI, even if the injuries appear to be relatively
minor, have elevated risks to develop a wide range of medical and social problems during
adulthood. The risks are substantially elevated as a function of injury severity, recurrence, and
time of injury. These observations have potentially important implications for the way that
paediatric TBI is currently clinically managed. Currently most children with significant head
injuries receive no systematic long-term follow-up. An implication of our findings is that this
should change. Services should consider how to routinely and systematically review these chil-
dren on a regular basis to allow the subtle but important neurological, cognitive, and psychiat-
ric consequences of TBI to be identified. Routinely tracking the progress of patients following
significant TBI allows those with an altered developmental and educational trajectory to be
identified and appropriate, age-sensitive interventions to be initiated. Detailed clinical studies
on representative paediatric populations are needed to extend recent advances in the under-
standing of adult TBI pathophysiology, as this will inform the nature of key drivers for poor
long-term outcome [61,62]. Effective prevention that minimises the risks of early exposure to
TBI is required, and such efforts should benefit from large-scale epidemiological studies that
identify potentially causal risk factors for the severity, recurrence, and developmental timing of
TBI.
