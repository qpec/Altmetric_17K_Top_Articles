IMPORTANCE Observational studies have shown that obesity is a major risk factor for
cardiovascular disease and death. The extent of genetic confounding in these associations
is unclear.
OBJECTIVE To compare the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), type 2 diabetes, and death in
monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for body mass index (BMI).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort of 4046 MZ twin pairs with discordant BMIs
(difference >0.01) was identified using the nationwide Swedish twin registry. The study was
conducted from March 17, 1998, to January 16, 2003, with follow-up regarding incident
outcomes until December 31, 2013.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The combined primary end point of death or MI and the
secondary end point of incident diabetes were evaluated in heavier compared with leaner
twins in a co-twin control analysis using multivariable conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS Mean (SD) baseline age for both cohorts was 57.6 (9.5) years (range, 41.9-91.8
years). During a mean follow-up period of 12.4 (2.5) years, 203 MIs (5.0%) and 550 deaths
(13.6%) occurred among heavier twins (mean [SD] BMI, 25.9 [3.6] [calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared]) compared with 209 MIs (5.2%) and 633
deaths (15.6%) among leaner twins (mean [SD] BMI, 23.9 [3.1]; combined multivariable
adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.91). Even in twin pairs with BMI discordance
of 7.0 or more (mean [SE], 9.3 [0.7]), where the heavier twin had a BMI of 30.0 or more
(n = 65 pairs), the risk of MI or death was not greater in heavier twins (OR, 0.42; 95% CI,
0.15-1.18). In contrast, in the total cohort of twins, the risk of incident diabetes was greater in
heavier twins (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.61-2.84). Finally, increases in BMI since 30 years before
baseline were not associated with the later risk of MI or death (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.89-1.05)
but were associated with the risk of incident diabetes (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In MZ twin pairs, higher BMI was not associated with an
increased risk of MI or death but was associated with the onset of diabetes. These results may
suggest that lifestyle interventions to reduce obesity are more effective in decreasing the risk
of diabetes than the risk of cardiovascular disease or death.

D
uring the past decades, the prevalence of overweight
andobesityintheWesternworldhasincreasedby30%
to 50%,1,2 leading to what has been described as a
global epidemic.3 The significance of obesity involves the
associated risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD),
stroke, and death.4,5 High body mass index (BMI) contrib-
utedtoatheoreticallyestimated3.4milliondeathsin2010—an
increase of 70% in 2 decades.6,7 In contrast to these esti-
mates, data suggest8 that the rates of death and myocardial
infarction (MI) are decreasing while the prevalence of obesity
increases; this trend is not explained by preventive medicine
alone.9,10Theseresultsaresupportedbyotherstudiesthatsug-
gest that the association between obesity and CVD and death
are more complex. In a meta-analysis,11 higher rates of death
were observed in normal-weight individuals compared with
overweight individuals, with normal weight referring to a BMI
of 18.5 to 24.9 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared) according to the World Health
Organization definition.7 A higher risk of death has also been
observed in normal-weight patients with CVD12,13 and pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes14 than in overweight or obese
individuals with these diseases.
Several explanations for this obesity paradox have been
suggested, including selection bias.15,16 Genetic confounding
might be another important source of bias (ie, genetic factors
shared by obesity and CVD may account for the association),
as also indicated by previous studies.17,18 Monozygotic (MZ)
twins are genetically identical and provide a unique tool for
the evaluation of the risk associated with obesity indepen-
dent of genetic factors. This evaluation can be accomplished
by comparing the risk of disease in twin pairs that are discor-
dant for obesity. Any differences between the twin pairs
with respect to the outcome of interest would then be inde-
pendent of genetic predisposition. Accordingly, we used a
cohort of BMI-discordant MZ twin pairs to estimate the
effects of lifestyle-acquired high BMI on mortality and risk of
MI. A secondary aim was to evaluate the risk of incident
diabetes in this cohort.
Methods
Study Population
ThestudycohortoriginatedfromtheSwedishtwinregistryand
the Screening Across Lifespan Twin (SALT) study,19 con-
ducted from 1998 to 2002 with the purpose of screening all
twins in Sweden born before 1958 for common complex dis-
eases. Information, including body weight and height,
was collected using a computer-assisted telephone interview
with up to 600 items; the study details have been described
elsewhere.19 In total, data from 44 820 twins were collected,
with a response rate of 74%. In this cohort there were 4357 MZ
twin pairs and 4102 MZ twin pairs in which both twins had re-
ported weight and height for estimation of BMI. For the
present study, we selected all MZ twin pairs (4046 pairs; 2283
female and 1763 male pairs) with discordant (difference >0.01)
self-reported BMIs. To determine the impact of longitudinal
changes in BMI before baseline, data were extended to include
questionnaire information that was distributed in 1972-1973
in 3245 MZ twin pairs20 that later were also included in the
SALT study. The regional ethics board in the Umeå, Sweden,
National Board of Health and Welfare and Statistics Sweden
approved this study, and all participants provided written in-
formedconsent.ThestudywasconductedfromMarch17,1998,
to January 16, 2003.
Selection of Diagnoses and Other Covariates of Interest
Diagnoses were collected from the National Patient Register
(NPR) maintained by the National Board of Health and Wel-
fare (http://www.socialstyrelsen.se). The NPR has covered all
inpatientcareinSwedensince1987andalloutpatientspecialist
care since 2001. Diagnoses recorded between 1987 and
December 31, 2013, were identified using appropriate
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)
and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes,
including MI (ICD-9 code, 410; ICD-10, I21), ischemic stroke
(ICD-9, 434; ICD-10, I63 and I64), cancer (all diagnoses),
diabetes (ICD-9, 250; ICD-10, E10 and E11), and alcohol abuse
(ICD-9, 303; ICD-D, F10). The NPR has been validated, with
positive predictive values of 85% to 95%.21,22 Prescriptions for
antidiabetic drugs could also be captured from the Swedish
drugregistryfrom2005andlater,andinformationaboutdeath
and causes thereof was collected from the National Causes of
Death Register (http://www.socialstyrelsen.se). Data on each
participant’
ssocialstatus,income,earlydisabilitypension,and
educational level were retrieved from the Statistics Sweden
(http://www.scb.se)databaseintheyearbeforetheSALTstudy.
Civil status was classified as married, cohabitant, divorced,
widow or widower, single, and living apart. Educational level
was classified as elementary school only, 2 years of secondary
high school, more than 2 years of secondary high school, and
university education. Data on income, early disability pension,
and educational level were missing for 0, 3, and 32 individuals
in the MZ cohort, respectively. Information about marital
status, birth order, birth weight, physical activity, and smoking
habit was retrieved from SALT questionnaire data. Physical
activity was classified as little or none, not a lot, or rather much
or very much. Smoking habit was classified as never smoked,
previous smoking, or currently smoking, and pack-years
of smoking were estimated. In addition, we included
questionnaireinformationreflectingunhealthydrinkinghabits
and diabetes. Data on smoking, physical activity, birth weight,
Key Points
Question Does genetic confounding influence the association
between obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease?
Findings In this cohort study of monozygotic twin pairs with
different body mass indexes, the heavier twin did not have a
higher risk for myocardial infarction or death than the leaner twin.
In contrast, the heavier twin had a higher risk of incident diabetes.
Meaning Lifestyle interventions to reduce obesity may be more
effective in reducing the risk of diabetes than the risk of
cardiovascular disease or death.

Statistical Analysis
Kaplan-Meiercurveswereconstructedfortwinswithlowerand
higher BMIs from each pair, with the primary end point of in-
cident MI or death. No imputations for missing data were per-
formed, and only complete cases were analyzed. Conditional
logistic regression analysis was used to compare the odds of
any end point in the twin cohort. The first model was unad-
justed(age-andsex-adjustedbydesign);thesecondmodelwas
adjustedforphysicalactivity,never/past/currentsmoking,and
pack-years of smoking; the third model was additionally ad-
justed for social status, income, educational level, disability
pension, alcohol abuse, and birth order; and the final model
was additionally adjusted for previous diagnoses (Table 1).
To evaluate whether the risk of death or MI in the BMI-
discordant twins was dependent on follow-up time, a flexible
parametric model was used with time-dependent effects and
3 degrees of freedom.23 To evaluate the association between
BMI and the primary end point in the total cohort of MZ twins

sion model with restricted cubic splines and 3 knots at de-

Results
Baseline Characteristics
Both MZ twin cohorts had a mean (SD) age of 57.6 (9.5) years
(range, 41.9-91.8 years) at baseline (date of the SALT study).
Mean baseline BMI in twins with higher and lower BMI within
each pair was 25.9 (3.6) and 23.9 (3.1), respectively (Table 1).
Among twins with higher BMI, 1796 (44.4%) were over-
weightand498(12.3%)wereobesecomparedwith1153(28.5%)
and 151 (3.7%), respectively, in twins with lower BMI. Twins
with higher BMIs were less physically active and fewer were
smokers (Table 1) compared with leaner twins from each pair.
Noothersignificantdifferencesinbaselinecharacteristicswere
detected. In a subcohort of 3245 twin pairs, the mean in-
crease in BMI from 1972 until baseline was significantly greater
in the heavier compared with the leaner twin (4.3 [2.9] vs 2.6
[2.6]; P < .001).
Risk of MI or Death
During a mean follow-up period of 12.4 (2.5) years, 203 MIs
(5.0%) and 550 deaths (13.6%) occurred in the heavier twins
compared with 209 MIs (5.2%) and 633 deaths (15.6%) in the
leaner twins (Figure 1). In the fully adjusted model, the odds
ratio (OR) for the combined primary end point of MI or death
was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.63-0.91) in heavier compared with
leaner twins (Table 2). The reduced probability of death or
MI in heavier twins was most pronounced in a subgroup of
those with BMIs of 24.9 or lower at baseline (OR, 0.61; 95%
CI, 0.46-0.80) and similar when comparing heavier and
leaner twins within the rest of the cohort (OR, 0.99; 95% CI,
0.75-1.31). The odds of death or MI were also not increased
significantly in the heavier compared with leaner twins in
other subgroups, such as nonsmokers and sedentary twins
and in groups stratified on sex (Figure 2). In a subcohort of
3245 twin pairs for whom longitudinal data were available,

the risk of death or MI was similar in the heavier and leaner
groups (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.66-1.08) after adjustment for
physical activity, smoking, and changes in BMI before base-
line. Increases in BMI during approximately 30 years before
baseline were not associated with the outcome in this model
(OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.89-1.05). Next, we analyzed the differ-
ence in the risk of MI or death in twin pairs based on the
extent of BMI dissimilarity in each pair (Figure 3). The risk of
MI or death did not differ significantly in twin pairs with
BMI differences of 1.0 to 7.0 or more before or after adjusting
for current smoking habits and physical activity. Finally, 65
twin pairs with BMI differences of 7.0 or more (mean [SE],
9.3 [0.7]), in which the higher BMI was 30.0 or more (mean,
35.0 [SD, 3.9] [SE, 0.5]), were examined. In this subgroup, 10
MIs or deaths occurred during follow-up in heavier twins
compared with 17 such events in leaner twins (unadjusted
OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.15-1.18).
Risk of Incident Diabetes
During follow-up, 345 incident cases of diabetes occurred in
the heavier twins compared with 224 cases in the leaner
twins. After adjustment for physical activity and smoking,

the OR of incident diabetes was 1.94 (95% CI, 1.51- 2.48) in
the heavier compared with leaner twins (Table 2). The risk of
incident diabetes was increased in the heavier twins in most
subgroups (eFigure 1 in the Supplement) and rose with
increasing BMI dissimilarity within each pair (eFigure 2 in
the Supplement). Accordingly, in pairs with BMI discordance
of 3.0 or more, the ORs of incident diabetes in heavier twins
compared with the ORs in leaner twins was greater than 5.0.
In the subcohort of 3245 twin pairs for whom we had access
to longitudinal data for BMI, the heavier twin had a higher
risk of incident diabetes compared with the leaner twin (OR,
1.55; 95% CI, 1.10-2.19) after adjusting for physical activity,
smoking, and changes in BMI from approximately 30 years
before baseline. In addition, increases in BMI before baseline
were associated with incident diabetes in this model (OR,
1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26).
Sensitivity Analyses
The risk of death or MI in heavier compared with leaner
twins was constant during follow-up (eFigure 3 in the
Supplement). Thus, the exclusion of twins with less than 1
year of follow-up time did not change the odds of the pri-
mary end point (unadjusted OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92).
To evaluate a risk factor that should increase the risk of
death and MI independent of genetic confounding, the risk
of these outcomes was analyzed in twin pairs discordant for
current smoking (n = 658). After adjustment for physical
activity level, the twin who was smoking had an increased
odds of death (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.65-3.72) and MI (OR, 1.74;
95% CI, 1.04-2.91). In a subcohort and using conditional
logistic regression, birth weight was not associated with the
risk of death (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.42-1.46 per 1-kg increase)
or MI (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.36-1.92).
Inanordinarynonpairwisecohortanalysisofthetotaltwin
cohort (n = 8092), the association between BMI and the pri-
mary end point (death or MI) was j-shaped, with greater risks
of death for individuals with low and high BMIs (eFigure 4 in
the Supplement). In individuals with BMIs of 24.0 or higher
(n = 4626), the risk of MI or death rose by approximately 5%
per1-unitincreaseinBMI(hazardratio[HR],1.05;95%CI,1.02-
1.08); the rate of MI or death during follow-up was approxi-
mately 37% higher in obese individuals (BMI, ≥30.0: HR, 1.37;
95%CI,1.12-1.69)thaninnormal-weightindividuals(BMI,18.5-
24.9) after adjustment for age, current smoking, and physical
activity. The MZ twin cohort analyzed in the present study was
similar in characteristics compared with all citizens aged 50
to 70 years living in Sweden on December 31, 2005 (eTable in
the Supplement).
Discussion
In the present study, the twin in each pair with the higher
BMI at baseline did not have a higher risk of later death or MI
than the leaner twin in any of the analyses performed. In
contrast, the risk of diabetes was significantly increased in
heavier twins. The results also showed that changes in BMI
approximately 30 years before baseline were not associated
with the risk of MI or death but were associated with the risk
of diabetes. The increased risk of diabetes in the heavier
twin was also significantly different than the risk associated
with MI or death. Together, the results may indicate that
interventions performed to promote weight loss are more
effective to reduce the incidence of diabetes than to reduce
the risk of CVD and death.
Because MZ twin pairs have identical genomes, differ-
ences in BMI in the present cohort were the result of envi-
ronmental and lifestyle factors. Results from a subcohort
also indicate that the differences in BMI between the heavier
and leaner twins resulted from lifestyle factors in midlife
since there were only small differences in BMI approxi-
mately 30 years before baseline. Our results show that the
risk of death or MI was lower in heavier than in leaner twins
overall after taking all available covariates into account. Sub-
group analyses indicated that this lower risk was attributable
to effects in the subgroup with baseline BMIs of 24.9 or
lower (ie, in those with normal BMIs according to the World
Health Organization’
s definition). Explanations could
include residual confounding from unknown diseases or
general frailty24 not captured at baseline in leaner twins.
Such influences could also result in a decrease in BMI before
the baseline assessments and is one explanation put forward
to explain the obesity paradox.16 In the present study,
adjustment for changes in BMI before baseline did not influ-
ence the risk of MI or mortality when we compared the
heavier and leaner twins. Furthermore, when twins with low
or normal BMI at baseline were excluded, the odds of MI or
death were not higher in subgroups in which the heavier
twin was overweight or obese. The results also remained
consistent with increasing BMI dissimilarity in twin pairs,
including a subgroup in which all high-BMI twins were obese
(mean BMI, 35.0). The results of the present study suggest
that lifestyle-obtained higher BMI with no genetic contribu-
tion, including direct genetic effects and gene-environment
interactions, is not causally related to an increased risk of
CVD or mortality.
Based on previous research, the importance of obesity in
the development of type 2 diabetes appears to be indisput-
able. In particular, studies25 have demonstrated that clinical
and laboratory factors are improved or resolved in most
patients with type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery, which
often results in a more than 50% weight loss in the first 2
postoperative years.26 In the present study, the risk of inci-
dent diabetes during follow-up was increased markedly in
heavier twins compared with leaner twins. This risk also
increased in heavier compared with leaner twins with
increasing BMI dissimilarity. Higher increases in BMI before
baseline also contributed to a higher risk of diabetes inde-
pendently of baseline BMI. These results suggest a causal
link between obesity and the risk of diabetes, independent
of genetic influence.
One randomized clinical trial27 was conducted to evalu-
ate intensive lifestyle interventions with the primary goal of
assessing mortality rates after weight loss. A total of 5145 over-
weight or obese (mean BMI) patients with type 2 diabetes were
assigned to an intervention program focusing on weight re-

duction through caloric restriction and increased physical ac-
tivity or to a control group. Participants in the intervention
group achieved a 9% weight loss during the first year, which
was reduced to 6% after 10 years. During the mean follow-up
period of approximately 10 years, the intervention had no sig-
nificant effect on mortality. The authors’
27 proposed possible
explanations for the lack of effect included insufficient weight
loss in the intervention group and the consequences of more
effective routine medical management of CVD in the control
group. Based on the findings of our twin study, the interven-
tion could also have been ineffective due to the primary
focus on weight loss.
Several limitations of the present study should be consid-
ered. Weight and height were self-reported, but a previous
evaluation28 of data from the twin registry concluded that the
use of BMI based on self-reported data would probably not
affect the results. Furthermore, in the nonpaired analysis of
the twin cohort (ie, without accounting for genetic effects), the
j-shaped pattern between self-reported BMI and the risk of MI
or death replicates the findings from previous observational
studies.11 In addition, self-reported BMI was linked to the de-
velopment of diabetes in the present study. Baseline differ-
ences in BMI between twins were the result of a combination
of environmental and lifestyle factors; thus, no conclusion can
be made regarding interventions that may have beneficial ef-
fects other than weight loss, such as physical activity.29 The
effectsofspecifictreatmentregimensforobesitywerenotlikely
captured in the study cohort, including bariatric surgery, for
which observational studies30 also suggest favorable long-
termeffectsonmortality.Therewasnoinformationaboutwaist
circumference,whichhasbeenfoundtobeassociatedwithvis-
ceral obesity31 and more strongly related to CVD than BMI.32
We also lacked information about some potential confound-
ers,suchashypertensionandhyperlipidemia.Giventhatthese
conditions are related to both obesity and CVD, adjustments
would, if anything, reduce the relative risk of CVD and death
in the leaner twins. Effective treatment of hypertension and
hyperlipidemia could contribute to the similar risk of CVD or
death in the twins with higher BMI. Finally, the results dem-
onstrating increased risk of diabetes, but not CVD or death, in
the heavier twin with an increasing BMI difference between
twin pairs should be interpreted with caution given the rela-
tively small sample sizes.
The strengths of the present study include the unique de-
sign used to evaluate causal effects of obesity on disease and
death after adjusting for genetic influences and the large co-
hort of MZ twins with information on multiple covariates. Be-
cause MZ twins share familial environmental factors,33 there
is a decreased likelihood of shared environmental confound-
ing in the co-twin analyses. Finally, studies34 in twins have
shown that cumulative risks of late-onset diseases and death
do not differ in twins compared with singletons. Characteris-
tics of the present twin cohort were similar to those of the total
Swedish population aged 50 to 70 years, suggesting that our
results may be valid for the general older population.
Conclusions
The present study was not able to verify that obesity is caus-
ally associated with an increased risk of MI or death after con-
sideration of genetic factors. In contrast, the results revealed
a significant association between obesity and diabetes after ac-
counting for genetic factors. The association between obesity
and diabetes was significantly stronger than the association
with CVD and death. This finding may indicate that interven-
tions to promote weight loss are more effective in reducing the
risk of diabetes than the risk of CVD and mortality.
