SUMMARY
Immune-based interventions are promising strategies to achieve long-term cancer-free survival. Fasting was
previously shown to differentially sensitize tumors to chemotherapy while protecting normal cells, including
hematopoietic stem and immune cells, from its toxic side effects. Here, we show that the combination of
chemotherapy and a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) increases the levels of bone marrow common lymphoid
progenitor cells and cytotoxic CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), leading to a major delay in breast
cancer and melanoma progression. In breast tumors, this effect is partially mediated by the downregulation
of the stress-responsive enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). These data indicate that FMD cycles combined
with chemotherapy can enhance T cell-dependent targeted killing of cancer cells both by stimulating the he-
matopoietic system and by enhancing CD8+-dependent tumor cytotoxicity.
INTRODUCTION
Immune cells act as sentinels that recognize peptides originating
from mutated genes and eliminate malignant and possibly pre-
malignant cells (Rock and Shen, 2005). Cancer immunotherapy
exploits this property of the immune system to recognize and
eliminate cancer cells (Vesely et al., 2011; Zitvogel et al., 2008)
by triggering the activation of inherent antitumor T cells (Pardoll,
2012; Wolchok et al., 2013) or through the reintroduction of en-
gineered T cells into patients (Burns et al., 2010; Maude et al.,
2014). The importance of a healthy immune system is underlined
by the fact that immunosuppressed/immunocompromised sub-
jects are at a higher risk for cancer (Zitvogel et al., 2006). More-
over, some traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutics rely on the
cooperation of the patient’s immune system to eliminate cancer
cells (Alizadeh et al., 2014; Arinaga et al., 1986; Bracci et al.,
2014).
The immunosuppressive effect of some standard interven-
tions, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Weinblatt
et al., 1985; Weiner and Cohen, 2002), can compromise their
therapeutic efficacy (Balow et al., 1975; Rasmussen and Arvin,
1982). Such therapeutic inefficacy and tumor resistance can
also be caused by regulatory T cells (Tregs), which can suppress
the lymphocytic activity through a mechanism mediated by
heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (Choi et al., 2005; El Andaloussi and
Lesniak, 2007). Conversely, some chemotherapeutics, such as
anthracyclines, are known to stimulate the recognition of cancer
cells by the immune system (Arinaga et al., 1986; Casares et al.,
2005; Orsini et al., 1977), which may potentiate the effect of
some immune-based therapies.
Significance
Cancer immunotherapy is a promising intervention for the targeted killing of tumor cells. However, tumor-localized immu-
nosuppression induced by cancer cells (immunoresistance) often leads to limited T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover,
chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced immunosuppression can further reduce the efficacy of immune-based treat-
ments. Here we show that a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) increases the levels of common lymphoid progenitor cells
(CLPs) and of circulating CD8+ lymphocytes. The combination of the FMD and doxorubicin increased the number of cyto-
toxic CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The FMD-induced recruitment of TILs was mediated by heme oxygenase-1
(HO-1) and was significantly correlated with a lower number of regulatory T cells in the tumor bed. Thus, the FMD is a prom-
ising intervention to potentiate immune-based and standard cancer therapies.

 We have previously shown that short-term starvation (STS) can
selectively sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutics (differen-
tial stress sensitization [DSS]), while simultaneously protecting
normal cells from their side effects (differential stress-resistance
[DSR]) (Lee et al., 2012; Raffaghello et al., 2008) via the insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathway and the regulation of glucose
levels (Lee et al., 2010). Recently, we also reported that STS pro-
motes hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and reverses
chemotherapy-induced
immunosuppression
(Cheng
et
al.,
2014). Because water-only STS is challenging for mice and can-
cer patients, we have developed a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD)
that is low in calories, protein, and sugar (Brandhorst et al.,
2015). This FMD reduces circulating IGF-1 and glucose, two ma-
jor factors involved in DSR and DSS, to levels similar to those
observed during STS (Brandhorst et al., 2015). Here, we tested
the effect of this FMD in combination with chemotherapy on the
immune system, and on the immunogenicity of cancer cells.
RESULTS
A FMD Alone or in Combination with Chemotherapy Is as
Effective as STS in Reducing Tumor Progression
We have previously shown that STS is safe and effective in
inducing DSS via IGF-1 signaling (Lee et al., 2012; Raffaghello
et al., 2008; Safdie et al., 2009). Here we tested the efficacy of
cycles of the FMD (Brandhorst et al., 2015) in inducing DSS in
a syngeneic murine breast cancer (4T1) model (Figure S1).
Four days of FMD feeding were as effective as 2 days of STS
in retarding tumor growth and reducing circulating IGF-1 in the
absence of chemotherapy (Figures 1A and 1B), and in sensitizing
cancer cells to doxorubicin (DXR) and cyclophosphamide (CP)
(Figures 1C, 1D, S2C, and S2D) (Lee et al., 2010, 2012; Raffa-
ghello et al., 2008). Similar effects of the FMD were also
observed in a murine melanoma (B16) model, in which mice
were treated with DXR (Figure 1E). The combination of the
FMD and DXR/CP had an additive effect on tumor suppression,
causing a 3-fold reduction in tumor volume compared with that
observed in mice fed ad libitum (Figures 1C–1E).
FMD in Combination with DXR Promotes Accumulation
of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in the Tumor Bed
STS promotes HSC self-renewal and reverses chemotherapy-
induced immunosuppression (Cheng et al., 2014). As previously
reported (Cheng et al., 2014), three cycles of the FMD also
caused a 33% increase in CD8+ circulating lymphocytes (Fig-
ure S2A) and a 2-fold increase in common lymphoid progenitor
cells (CLP) in the bone marrow (Figures 2A and S2B). This in-
crease, likely due to HSC regeneration following re-feeding after
STS (Cheng et al., 2014), raises the possibility that the immune
system may be involved in mediating FMD-dependent DSS.
To evaluate whether FMD cycles could promote tumor immu-
nogenicity, we measured the level of tumor-infiltrating lympho-
cytes (TILs) after three cycles of FMD + DXR in mice. Only the
combination of FMD + DXR significantly increased the number
of CD3+/CD8+ TILs, as determined by both immunohistochem-
istry (Figures 2B and S2E–S2J) and fluorescence-activated
cell-sorting analysis (Figures 2C–2E), but there were no signifi-
cant changes in the number of CD3�/CD8+ cells (Figure S2K).
CD3+ cell infiltration increased after the first FMD cycle (Figures
S2E–S2G), whereas CD8+ cell infiltration increased after the third

Figure 1. A Fasting-Mimicking Diet Alone or in Combination with Chemotherapy Is as Effective as Short-Term Starvation in Reducing Tumor
Progression
(A–D) 12-week-old female BALB/c mice were grafted with breast cancer (4T1) cells and subjected to (A) multiple cycles of FMD or STS alone, or to a combination
of FMD and the chemotherapy drugs (C) doxorubicin (DXR) or (D) cyclophosphamide (CP). (B) Circulating IGF-1 levels at the end of STS or FMD in (A) were
measured.
(E) 12-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were grafted with melanoma (B16) cells and subjected to multiple cycles of FMD alone or in combination with DXR. Tumor
volume at multiple time points (on the left) and immediately before euthanasia (on the right) are reported for each set of treatments. The animals receiving
chemotherapy were injected at the end of each FMD cycle (shaded area).
(A and B) n = 10, (C) n = 13, (D) n = 10, and (E) n = 15. Data are represented as means ± SEM. One-way ANOVA (Tukey’s post-analysis test) was performed.

 FMD cycle, only in combination with DXR (Figures S2H–S2J).
The cytotoxic activity of TILs was reflected by increased levels
of granzyme B and apoptosis in tumor cells, and by reduced tu-
mor size (Figure S3). Similarly, higher levels of CD3+/CD8+ TILs
were observed in C57BL/6 mice bearing melanoma (B16) that
underwent FMD + DXR treatment (Figures 1E and 2F).
CD3+/CD8+ Lymphocytes are Key in FMD-Mediated DSS
to Chemotherapy
CD3+/CD8+ TILs are tumor-killing effector immune cells, which
serve as an indicator of favorable prognosis (Andre et al.,
2013; Issa-Nummer et al., 2013). To test whether CD3+/CD8+
TILs are required for FMD-induced tumor sensitization, we
examined immunocompromised nude BALB/c mice that are
athymic and therefore do not produce T lymphocytes. In contrast
to the results in immunocompetent mice, the FMD was not effec-
tive in reducing tumor progression in nude mice (Figure 3A), and
showed no changes in granzyme B or cleaved caspase-3 levels
(Figures S4A–S4E). Nonetheless, the FMD successfully pro-
tected nude mice against DXR-dependent and tumor-indepen-
dent toxicity (Figure 3B) (Raffaghello et al., 2008), indicating
that the FMD-induced protection of normal cells, unlike tumor
sensitization, is not affected by T lymphocyte function.
To directly test the role of TILs in mediating the FMD-depen-
dent sensitization of tumors to DXR, we selectively depleted
CD8+ T lymphocytes using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody

Figure 2. FMD in Combination with Doxorubicin Promotes Accumulation of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in the Tumor Bed
(A) Bone marrow collected from BALB/c mice undergoing FMD/DXR treatments (see Figure S3A) was collected at the end of the experiment and analyzed with
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (n = 6) to assess the levels of common lymphoid progenitors (CLP).
(B) Breast cancer (4T1) tumor tissues collected at the end of the experiment (see Figure S3A) were analyzed using immunohistochemistry to assess CD3+/CD8+
TILs (n = 8) (quantification on the right).
(C, E) CD3+/CD8+ and (D, E) CD3+/CD4+/CD25+ were also assessed by FACS analysis (n = 7) in tumor tissue collected from a separate, equivalent experiment (see
Figure 1C).
(F) Melanoma (B16) tissue collected (see Figure 1E) was also processed to assess the levels of TILs (quantification on the right). Scale bar for DAPI, CD3, and CD8
is 75 mm. Scale bar for CD3+/CD8+ is 12.5 mm.
Data are represented as means ± SEM. The significance of the differences between experimental groups was determined by using one-way ANOVA (Tukey’s
post-analysis test). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001. See also Figure S2.

 (aCD8; clone YTS 169.4) (Carmi et al., 2015) or IgG (control) (Fig-
ures 3C and 3E). Notably, the depletion of CD8+ circulating cells
was also associated with an increase in the number of Tregs (Fig-
ures 3D and 3E). The antibody-dependent depletion of CD8+ T
lymphocytes reversed the effects of FMD + DXR on the progres-
sion of grafted breast tumors (Figures 3F and 3G). Furthermore,
lymphocytes isolated from aCD8 antibody-treated mice caused
significantly less cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells in vitro compared with
those from IgG-treated mice (Figure 3H).
These results indicate that activated TILs are important for
the FMD-dependent sensitization of breast cancer cells to
chemotherapeutics.
Anthracyclines can increase cancer cell immunogenicity and
attract cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to the tumor (Michaud
et al., 2011). To test whether the FMD directly increases tumor
immunogenicity, we cultured breast cancer cells (4T1) in FMD-
like conditions (referred to as STS for in vitro experiments and
consisting of reduced glucose/serum) and DXR before grafting
them into immunocompetent mice. One week after grafting the
pre-conditioned breast cancer cells, all mice were also grafted
with naive breast cancer cells on the other flank (Figure 3I).
Although all mice were ‘‘immunized’’ by grafting the same num-
ber of live pre-conditioned breast cancer cells, the DXR and
STS + DXR groups did not develop tumors (Figures 3J and
S4F). Consistent with previous studies (Casares et al., 2005; In-
oue et al., 2014), naive tumors on the other flank displayed
retarded growth after 4 weeks in mice grafted with cells pre-
cultured with DXR (Figure 3K). Notably, STS pre-conditioning
alone was more effective than STS + DXR, possibly because
the less severe apoptotic effects of the STS allowed the immuno-
genic cancer cells to live longer and therefore provide a pro-
longed immunogenic stimuli after grafting in mice (Figures 3J,
3K, and S4F).
Collectively, these results indicate that FMD (i.e., STS
in vitro) increased DXR-dependent tumor immunogenicity and
expanded the pool of CD8+ TILs needed to effectively target
tumors.
HO-1 Is a Mediator of FMD/STS-Dependent DSS
We performed microarray analysis to identify STS-dependent ef-
fects on the differential expression in normal and cancer cells of
genes that may be relevant to TIL-dependent toxicity, and iden-
tified the inducible stress-responsive protein HO-1 as a potential
candidate (Figure S5A). Thereafter, we confirmed that both STS
and FMD reduced the expression of HO-1 in the grafted breast
tumors (Figure 4A). On the contrary, STS differentially increased
HO-1 expression in normal tissues (Figure 4A). Notably, the
expression of Nrf2, an upstream regulator of HO-1, was also
differentially reduced in the grafted breast tumors following
STS (Figure S5B). Similar effects on HO-1 expression were
also observed in vitro (Figures 4B, S5C, and S5D), specifically
in the nucleus (Figure S5E). In fact, cancer cells have been re-
ported to show increased levels of nuclear HO-1 independent
of its enzymatic activity (Hsu et al., 2015).
To test the role of HO-1 in FMD-mediated DSS, we cultured
4T1 cancer cells in normal or FMD-like conditions (referred to
as STS for in vitro experiments and consisting of reduced
glucose/serum) and exposed them to the HO-1 activator hemin
or its inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) in the presence of
CP or DXR. The induction of HO-1 using hemin (Figures 4C,
4E, and S5F) or its overexpression by stably transfecting a
pHO-1 construct (Suliman et al., 2007) (Figures S5G and S5H)
in breast cancer cells (4T1) partially reversed the STS-induced
sensitization to DXR and CP in vitro (Figures 4D and 4F).
Conversely, the HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP sensitized breast cancer
cells (4T1) to CP under normal conditions in vitro (Figure 4G).
Thus, the downregulation of HO-1 is important for FMD-depen-
dent DSS.
Downregulation of HO-1 in the Tumor by FMD/STS Is
Necessary To Decrease Tregs and for the Immune-
Dependent Targeting of Cancer Cells
HO-1 is known to confer protection against oxidative damage
and apoptosis (Chen et al., 2004), promote tumor progression
(Hirai et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2011; Metz et al., 2010), and have
immunomodulatory roles that affect various T cell subpopula-
tions including Tregs (Brusko et al., 2005; Xia et al., 2008).
In mice, HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP (40 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally
[i. p.]) treatment was as effective as STS in retarding breast tumor
progression (4T1) (Figure 5A). In agreement with the in vitro re-
sults, concurrent hemin treatment (30 mg/kg/day i.p.) reversed
STS-induced retardation of breast tumors (4T1), whereas hemin
alone did not show significant responses (Figure 5B). Both the in-
duction and overexpression of HO-1 (by hemin or stable trans-
fection, respectively), and the CD8+ CTL depletion reversed
the FMD-induced (1) sensitization of breast tumors (4T1) to
DXR (Figures 5C, 5D, and 6A) and (2) accumulation of CD3+/
CD8+ TILs (Figures 6B and 6D). Interestingly, HO-1 induction/
overexpression also increased CD3+/CD4+/CD25+ Tregs and,
to a much smaller extent, CD3+/CD8+/CD25+ Tregs in the tumor
(Figures 6C, 6D, and S5K). Similar effects were observed after
CP treatment (Figure S6). As expected, CD8+ CTL depletion
alone was not associated with increased levels of tumor-associ-
ated Tregs (Figure 6C). In mammalian cells, HO-1 is a rate-
limiting enzyme catalyzing the degradation of heme to produce
carbon monoxide (CO), free iron, and biliverdin (Maines, 1988).
(F) Tumor volumes of FMD + DXR and FMD + DXR + aCD8 were measured at multiple time points.
(G) TILs were also assessed in tumor samples collected from the same animals.

(I) Mice were immunized by subcutaneous inoculation (in the left flank) with 4T1 breast cancer cells pre-conditioned in vitro with either ad libitum (2 g/l glucose +
10% FBS) or STS medium (0.5 g/l glucose + 1% FBS) with or without DXR (5 mM). 7 days after the immunization, the same animals were inoculated with naive 4T1
cells in the right flank (n = 10).

 Biliverdin can have antioxidative effects (Abraham and Kappas,
2008; Otterbein et al., 2000), but its treatment alone was not suf-
ficient to reverse the FMD-dependent DSS (Figures S5I and S5J),
suggesting a more complex involvement of the HO-1 pathway.
Because HO-1-dependent increase of CO has been shown to
interfere with angiogenesis (Ahmad et al., 2015), metastasis (Ter-
til et al., 2015), and tumor growth (Wegiel et al., 2013) it will be
important to further study the potential role of CO in the anti-
tumor effects of the FMD.
These results indicate that reduced HO-1 expression in
tumors mediates, in part, the anticancer effect of FMD by
increasing CD8+ TIL-dependent cytotoxicity, which may be facil-
itated by downregulation of Tregs.
DISCUSSION
We provide evidence that the FMD-dependent DSS is, in part,
mediated by CD8+ TIL-dependent killing of cancer cells, associ-
ated with an increase in lymphoid progenitor cells.
Immunological approaches are among the most promising
treatments, with the potential to result in cancer-free survival.
However, immunotherapies are expensive and often effective
only in a subset of patients. Here we show that fasting can be
substituted with a low calorie and protein FMD, which provides
high nourishment and is effective in inducing the targeted killing
of cancer cells. The efficacy of the FMD can be enhanced when
it is administered in combination with various chemotherapeu-
tics. The efficacy of fasting in inducing DSS both in in vitro
and in vivo models has been extensively reported in recent
years and has been proposed to be mediated, in part, by the
reduction of circulating IGF-1 and glucose levels (Lee et al.,
2010, 2012; Raffaghello et al., 2008). Our study shows that
T cells can play a key role in the killing of breast cancer cells
during FMD/STS. Another important component of the anti-
tumor activity triggered by FMD/STS appears to be its effect
on the repopulation of the bone marrow with CLPs (Cheng
et al., 2014). Our work extended from the systemic benefits of
the FMD on the immune system to those promoting a targeted
killing of cancer cells. Because of the strong association be-
tween the presence of CD3+/CD8+ TILs in the tumor bed and
a positive outcome of the cancer treatment (Andre et al.,
2013; Issa-Nummer et al., 2013), our results are of potential
therapeutic relevance as they show the effect of a safe and inex-
pensive regimen in improving the efficacy of cancer therapy by
stimulating T cell-dependent cytotoxicity. Notably, FMD and
STS are likely to contribute to the killing of cancer cells both
by immune-dependent and immune-independent mechanisms,
although the effects on 4T1 cells appear to be mostly depen-
dent on the activity of T cells.
HO-1 expression, which is often elevated in tumors, has been
shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of several types of can-
cers (Liu et al., 2004). Here, we show that FMD/STS causes a
reduction in HO-1 expression in cancer cells, but not in normal
cells. Thus, under FMD conditions, cancer cells but not normal
cells are sensitized to chemotherapy, in part by differential regu-
lation of HO-1. In agreement with our results HO-1 downregula-
tion in cancer cells can void their ability to activate Tregs and
overcome
in
situ
immunoattack
(Otterbein
et
al.,
2000).

 Consistent with an involvement of Tregs in HO-1-dependent
regulation of DSS, the activation of HO-1 in mice rendered the
FMD ineffective in inducing an immune-based attack of cancer
cells, while its pharmacological inhibition was sufficient to
reduce tumor progression in the absence of an FMD treatment.
Taken together, these results indicate that FMD can enhance
the efficacy of chemotherapy by enhancing tumor immunoge-
nicity, in part by an HO-1-dependent mechanism, which pro-
motes the recruitment of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to the tumor
bed and reduces tumor-associated Tregs (Figure 7). Thus,
FMD cycles have the potential for clinical application based on
the enhancement of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity to cancer cells
in the presence or absence of chemotherapy, but may also
increase the efficacy of antibodies or other immunological stra-
tegies being developed for the treatment of a wide variety of
tumors.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Twelve-week-old BALB/c (wild-type) and BALB/c nude mice were purchased
from Simonsen Laboratories or from Envigo. Twelve-week-old C57BL/6
female
mice
were
purchased
from
Charles
River
Laboratories
Inter-
national. The animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions
with 12 hr day/light cycles. All the experiments were performed according
to procedures approved by USC’s Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Diet
Mice were maintained on irradiated TD.7912 rodent chow (Harlan Teklad). In
brief, this diet contains 3.75 kcal/g of digestible energy with calories supplied
by protein, carbohydrate, and fat in a percent ratio of 25:58:17. Food was
provided ad libitum. On average, mice in the control group consumed
14.9 kcal/day (or 3.9 g/day). Our experimental FMD diet is based on a nutri-
tional screen that identified ingredients allowing high nourishment during pe-
riods of low calorie consumption (Brandhorst et al., 2013). Before supplying
the FMD diet, animals were transferred into fresh cages to avoid feeding on
residual chow and coprophagy. The FMD diet consists of two different com-
ponents designated as day 1 diet and day 2–4 diet that were fed in this order,
respectively. The day 1 diet contains 1.88 kcal/g and was designed to adapt
the mouse to a period of low caloric intake during the subsequent feeding
days. The day 2–4 diet is identical on all feeding days and contains
0.36 kcal/g. The day 1 and day 2–4 diets were fed as the average intake
(�4 g) of the control group fed ad libitum every 2 weeks. Due to the different
caloric densities of the supplied FMD diet, mice in this cohort had a �50%
reduction in consumed calories on day 1 and consumed 9.7% of the control
cohort on days 2–4. Mice consumed all the supplied food on each day of the
FMD regimen and showed no signs of food aversion. After the end of the day
2–4 diet, we supplied TD.7912 chow ad libitum for 10 days before starting
another FMD cycle.
STS
In the in vivo model, animals underwent complete food deprivation with free
access to water for a total of 48–60 hr to allow a 20% bodyweight loss. In order
to avoid dehydration, the mice were fed a low caloric hydrogel, which encour-
aged water consumption. During the STS regimen, mice were individually
housed in a clean cage to reduce cannibalism and coprophagy. Body weight
was measured immediately before, during, and after fasting. In the in vitro
model, FMD-like conditions in cell culture models are referred to as STS
(0.5 g/l glucose with 1% fetal bovine serum [FBS]).
Cancer Cell Lines and Tumor Cell Injection
MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma (gift from Amy Lee, University of South-
ern California), 4T1-luc murine breast cancer (SibTech), and B16 murine mel-
anoma (gift from Noah Craft, UCLA) cell lines were cultured in high glucose
(4.5 g/l) DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at
37�C and 5% CO2. To establish a subcutaneous cancer mouse model, we in-
jected female BALB/c mice or female C57BL/6 mice with 4T1 breast cancer
cells or B16 melanoma cells, respectively. Before injection, cells in the log

 phase of growth were harvested and suspended in PBS at 2 3 106 cells/ml,
and 100 ml (2 3 105 cells per mouse) were injected subcutaneously in the flank.
Body weight was determined periodically, and tumor size was measured
with a digital vernier caliper. Tumor volume was calculated with the following
equation: tumor volume (mm3) = (length 3 width 3 height)/2, where the height,
length, and width are in millimeters.
Immunization with In Vitro Pre-conditioned Cancer Cells
4T1-luc murine breast cancer cells (SibTech) were pre-treated in vitro by 48 hr
culture under normal conditions (2.0 g/l glucose supplemented with 10%
FBS) or ‘‘fasting-mimicking conditions’’ (i.e., STS; 0.5 g/l glucose supple-
mented with 1% FBS) at 37�C and 5% CO2. For those cells undergoing
DXR pre-conditioning, the drug was added to the medium to a final concen-
tration of 5 mM for the 24 hr preceding the tumor implantation. To induce a
‘‘tumor vaccination,’’ the in vitro pre-conditioned cells were injected subcuta-
neously into the left flank of 12-week-old female BALB/c mice. Specifically,
cancer cells pre-conditioned with normal and ‘‘fasting-mimicking’’ medium
were inoculated in mice fed ad libitum and belonging to the ad lib and STS
groups, respectively. Cells pre-treated in vitro with DXR under the same con-
ditions described above were injected in mice belonging to the DXR and
STS + DXR groups. One week after the implantation of pre-treated 4T1 tumor

cells, the mice were implanted with untreated 4T1
cells in the right flank. Before injection, cells in the
log phase of growth were harvested, analyzed
with trypan blue staining, and suspended in PBS
at 2 3 106 living cells/ml, then 100 ml (2 3 105 cells
per mouse) were injected subcutaneously in the
mouse. It is important to clarify that, for this specific
experiment, all mice were fed ad libitum for the
whole time and the only difference between one
group and the other was the different pre-condi-
tioning of the cancer cells inoculated. All cells
were grown to 70% confluency and only live cells,
determined by trypan blue exclusion, were used for
subcutaneous grafting. An equal number of live
cells was injected into each mouse.
Generation of pHO-1 4T1 Cells
4T1-luc murine breast cancer (SibTech) cells were
transfected with HO-1 plasmid (Suliman et al.,
2007), or its parental empty vector, DNA using Lip-
ofectamine 3000. Following incubation at 37�C for
48 hr, the transfected cells were incubated in selec-
tion medium containing G418. The selection step
was carried on for 7 days and the selecting medium
was replaced every 48 hr. Upon seeding, single col-
onies were grown, selected, and then expanded.
The effectiveness of transfection was confirmed with PCR and western blot
analyses in some of the clones.
Quantitative PCR
Relative transcript expression levels were measured using RT2 qPCR Primer
Assay for Hmox1 (QIAGEN).
Subcellular Fraction Isolation
For the isolation of cellular fractions, following culture in control and STS
medium conditions, 4T1 cells were trypsinized, washed in ice-cold PBS, and
processed using a Qproteome Mitochondria Isolation Kit following the manu-
facturer’s recommendations (QIAGEN).
Statistical Analyses
ImageJ software was used for the quantification of the signal and GraphPad
Prism v5.0c was used for the graphic representation and statistical analysis
of the data. The significance of the differences between groups in mouse ex-
periments was determined using ANOVA analysis in GraphPad Prism v5.0c.
Tukey’s test was used in the post analysis and the differences were consid-
ered significant if the p value was %0.05. Comparisons between groups
were done with Student’s t test using GraphPad Prism v.5.0c. All the

Figure 7. A Model of FMD-Dependent DSS in Tumors
Two scenarios describing the rearrangement of tumor and immune system under different dietary interventions are shown. FMD + DXR increases
the immunogenicity of tumors in an HO-1-dependent manner, and increases the recruitment of CD3+/CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes to the tumor bed (TILs),
leading to the targeted attack of cancer cells. Such increase of CD3+/CD8+ TILs is accompanied by the reduction of CD3+/CD4+/CD25+ Tregs in the tumor
bed. The latter scenario is also associated with an increase of CLP in the bone marrow and of circulating CD3+/CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes. Dendritic
cells (DC) can recognize DXR-induced apoptotic tumor cells and stimulate circulating CD3+/CD8+ CTLs, which, in our model, can be augmented by FMD
cycles.
