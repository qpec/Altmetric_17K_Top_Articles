SUMMARY
Typically, �0.1% of the total number of olfactory sen-
sory neurons (OSNs) in the main olfactory epithelium
express the same odorant receptor (OR) in a singular
fashion and their axons coalesce into homotypic
glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Here, we have
dramatically increased the total number of OSNs
expressing specific cloned OR coding sequences
by multimerizing a 21-bp sequence encompassing
the predicted homeodomain binding site sequence,
TAATGA,
known
to
be
essential
in
OR
gene
choice. Singular gene choice is maintained in these
‘‘MouSensors.’’ In vivo synaptopHluorin imaging of
odor-induced responses by known M71 ligands
shows functional glomerular activation in an M71
MouSensor. Moreover, a behavioral avoidance task
demonstrates that specific odor detection thresh-
olds are significantly decreased in multiple trans-
genic lines, expressing mouse or human ORs. We
have developed a versatile platform to study gene
choice and axon identity, to create biosensors with
great translational potential, and to finally decode
human olfaction.
INTRODUCTION
Odorant receptor (OR) genes form the largest multigene family in
mammals, with about 1,200 members in the mouse and 350 in
humans (Zhang and Firestein, 2002). The main olfactory epithe-
lium (MOE) expresses ORs through a poorly understood singular
gene choice mechanism, whereby only one allele of any OR gene
is selected for specific expression in a given neuron (Chess et al.,
1994; Strotmann et al., 2000). Axons from olfactory sensory neu-
rons (OSNs) that express identical ORs coalesce into 2 out of the
roughly 1,800 glomeruli per olfactory bulb (OB). The OR coding
sequence (CDS) plays a role in the maintenance of gene choice;
that is, if the OR is not capable of this maintenance, then a sec-
ond OR allele is tested for functionality (Feinstein et al., 2004).
Hence, deletion of an OR CDS precludes the convergence of
axons into a specific glomerulus and results in OSNs choosing
to express one of the other OR genes and concomitantly projec-
ting to a variety of glomeruli in the OB. In addition, OR proteins
are necessary for promoting axon guidance, axon identity, and
stabilizing neurons that have chosen to express those ORs (Fein-
stein et al., 2004; Feinstein and Mombaerts, 2004). Finally, the
OR protein needs to be targeted to the olfactory cilia where it
will function in odor signal transduction.
There has been limited success in odor profiling of ORs ex-
pressed in heterologous cells in vitro. Part of this limitation is
due to the inability of OR proteins to traffic to the plasma mem-
brane. In addition, given the biological properties of the olfactory
system, many OR alleles characterized in vitro may not be func-
tional in an in vivo setting and thus could be intact pseudogenes.
The major drawback, however, has been the ability to rapidly
contrast how odors presented to the OR in liquid phase
(in vitro) correspond to odors presented in vapor phase within
their mucosal environment (in vivo). Even ex vivo patching of
dendritic knobs from transgenic and gene-targeted mice suffers
from an absence of vapor phase delivery of odors. Finally, the
study of both OR gene choice and OR coding in vivo is hampered
by the low representation of a given OR, which, on average, is
only expressed in 0.1% of the total neuronal population of a
wild-type mouse.
To increase specific OR representation by modulating OR
gene choice, we have been characterizing OR minigenes for
the past decade. We have identified highly conserved motifs in
the promoter sequences of several mouse OR genes that are
necessary and sufficient for singular gene choice (Rothman
et al., 2005; Vassalli et al., 2011). In the case of an M71 OR
minigene, a 7.5-kb DNA fragment accurately recapitulates the
functionality of the gene-targeted M71 locus and imparts an
expression pattern paralleling that of endogenous genes. We
have previously observed the following two highly conserved se-
quences: a single candidate Olfactory-1/Early B Cell Factor
(Olf1/EBF or O/E) binding site and two candidate-LIM homeobox
2 (Lhx2) binding sites (TAATXX or HD) within a 161-bp region. Our
experiments suggested that an HD sequence is critical for regu-
lating the probability for any OR gene to be expressed (Vassalli
et al., 2011).

 Analysis of sequences known to strongly influence OR gene
choice such as the mouse H (the homology region that acti-
vates the MOR28 cluster [Serizawa et al., 2003]) and P (a
sequence with high homology to the P3 minimal promoter
[Bozza et al., 2009]) elements have revealed a set of three HD
binding sites (TAATGA) in close proximity to each other, and
an associated O/E site, with one of the HD sites sharing the
same 13-mer AACTTTTTAATGA between them. When a
19-mer containing this 13-mer sequence from the P element
was multimerized nine times (9x19) and placed upstream of
the MOR23 transgene backbone, modest increases in cell
numbers were observed in 3/17 transgenic founders. Because
analysis of chimeric P/P3 promoter transgenes suggested
that DNA spacing of the HD might influence OR gene choice
(data not shown), we designed a gene choice enhancer consist-
ing of various multimers of a 21-bp sequence from the H
element (ACATAACTTTTTAATGAGTCT), each covering two
DNA turns of 10.5 bp and thereby allowing for maximum coop-
erativity of transcription factors, resulting in a radical increase in
expression of any cloned OR CDS, which was never obtained
with the 9x19 transgenic approach. We refer to these designer
mice as ‘‘MouSensors.’’
We provide a genetic platform, which increases the total pop-
ulation of OSNs expressing a specific OR, enabling us to robustly
study OR gene choice, axon identity, and odor coding simulta-
neously in its intact in vivo environment. Importantly, we show
that we can also express human ORs in large numbers of mouse
OSNs in our MouSensors, providing a breakthrough technology
to crack the human olfactory code.
RESULTS
The MouSensor Transgene
Using the previously described M71 minigene (Rothman et al.,
2005), we re-designed the transgenic vector in a modular
way such that any number of the 21-bp enhancer sequence
(ACATAACTTTTTAATGAGTCT) and any OR CDS of interest
can be cloned (Figure 1). The addition of a bicistronic reporter al-
lows for the visualization of the olfactory neuronal morphology.
Effect of 21-mer Multimerization on the Organization of
the Olfactory System
Here we tested the effect of our newly designed enhancer
element on increasing the probability of OR gene choice. We
performed an initial analysis of various M71 transgenic lines con-
taining 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 multimers of the 21-mer sequence (Table
S1). We conclude that less than 50% of germline animals con-
taining fewer than four 21 multimers show expression of the
cloned OR and none of them are robust expressers. On the con-
trary, all 4x21 M71 lines generate robust increased expression
(3/3 germline animals); we have bred two 4x21-M71 lines
(4,M71Ca and b) for further analysis.
Subsequently, we assessed whether the copy number of
the transgenes insertions influences the rate of OR expression
by real-time qPCR as previously described (D’Hulst et al.,
2013) and found no correlation between the expression level
and copy number. Hemizygous 4,M71Ca contain �15 copies,
whereas hemizygous 4,M71Cb showed �24 copies. Interest-
ingly, 9 0,M71C founders contained between 5 and 32 insertions
of the transgene, but do not show any robust OR expression
(Tables S1 and S2). We hypothesize that our 4x21 enhancer
is able to recruit factors that can modulate the chromatin envi-
ronment and, as such, promotes specific OR expression when
randomly inserted in the genome.
To contrast the effect of increasing choice of the M71 OR in the
4,M71Ca line on the expression level of the ‘‘endogenous’’ M71
OR on axon guidance and identity, we crossed this line to M71-
IRES-tauGFP mice gene targeted at the M71 locus (M71-GFP,
129 strain) (Feinstein et al., 2004). This established a new mouse
line that is either homozygous for M71-GFP (M71-GFP�/�,

(A) Design of the transgene. Top: the transgenic
vector is created using the M71 OR genomic
backbone. Any number of H_21-mer repeats can
be shuttled in the NheI site upstream of the tran-
scriptional start site (TSS), and any OR CDS can
be cloned into the AscI site. An IRES-tauCherry
cassette (PacI) follows the OR CDS. The internal
ribosomal entry sequence (IRES) allows for bicis-
tronic translation and simultaneous expression of
mCherry, enabling the visualization of the olfactory
morphology. Transgenic animals are generated
by pronuclear injection of PmeI (black) digested
DNA. Bottom: comparison of the HD binding sites

10.5 bp, multimerization of 21-merpositions theHD
binding sites on the same site of the DNA, allowing
for cooperative binding of transcription factors.

 henceforth known as WT) or homozygous for M71-GFP and
hemizygous or homozygous for the M71-IREStauCherry trans-
gene (4,M71Ca+/0;M71-GFP�/� or 4,M71Ca+/+;M71-GFP�/�
henceforth known as 4,M71Ca hemi or homo, respectively). In
our 4,M71Ca line, the increase of OSNs expressing the M71
OR results in the coalescence of labeled axons onto one lateral
glomerulus and one medial glomerulus per OB side (Figure 2),
which are significantly larger (calculated spherical radius of
80–100 mm) than typical glomeruli (radius of �33 mm [Bressel
et al., 2016]). We confirmed the linear correlation between the
number of OSNs expressing a given OR and the total volume
of corresponding glomeruli in the OB, by performing real-time
qPCR to quantify M71 OR expression in the MOE (Figure 2;
Tables S4 and S5). We find that the level of M71-Cherry RNA is
significantly increased by �12-fold (p < 0.01) when compared
to M71-GFP within the hemi 4,M71Ca line and by �45-fold
(p < 0.01) when compared to M71-GFP in the WT line. This
apparent discrepancy is explained by the fact that the expres-
sion of the gene-targeted M71-GFP is 3.89-fold higher in the
4,M71Ca hemi animals when compared to the WT animals
(p < 0.01). These numbers suggest that increasing M71-Cherry
RNA levels help stabilize the endogenous M71-GFP RNA levels
early in development in the 4,M71Ca line, instead of cannibal-
izing their ability to be chosen, leading to an increase in endog-
enous M71 transcripts in the 4,M71Ca animals. This model is
supported by the fact that OSNs are interdependent in maintain-
ing axonal projections (Ebrahimi and Chess, 2000). Importantly,
we show that we have not changed the total number of mature
OSNs in the 4,M71Ca animals (real-time qPCR shows that olfac-
tory marker protein [omp] RNA levels are not changed between
4,M71Ca and WT animals [Figure 2]). This real-time qPCR anal-
ysis together with calculations of the total glomerular volume
(TGV) using 4,M71Ca MOE sections (data not shown) allow us
to estimate the total increase in M71 OR expression in 8-week-
old hemi 4,M71Ca animals to about 1% of the total OSN popu-
lation as compared to 0.02% in WT animals, assuming a total of
10 million total OSNs (Bressel et al., 2016).
Finally, because glomerulus-like structures may form in
absence of postsynaptic olfactory neurons (Bulfone et al.,
1998), we assessed whether the postsynaptic bulbar circuitry
necessary to convey olfactory sensory information to the higher
cortical regions remains intact (Belluscio et al., 2002). Therefore,
we crossed an existing YFP-g transgenic mouse line (in which
30% of the postsynaptic mitral cells are labeled in yellow) to
the 4,M71Ca line to visualize mitral cell dendrites (Figures 2
and S1). We establish that mitral cell innervation of the M71
glomerulus appears to be unchanged, as dendrites from post-
synaptic mitral and tufted cells are present.
Singular Gene Expression in the 4,M71Ca Line
Monogenic and monoallelic expression of OR genes is a prereq-
uisite for proper function of the olfactory system. Therefore, we
assessed whether this mechanism of singular gene choice is
maintained in our 4,M71Ca MouSensors.
Using coronal cryosections of the MOE of 4,M71Ca hemi an-
imals, we have counted a total of 4,754 Cherry-positive cells ex-
pressing the M71 4x21 transgene and 221 GFP-positive cells ex-
pressing the M71-GFP gene-targeted mutation; none of the red
cells co-express the green marker in the MOE, suggesting that
the 4x21 M71 transgene maintains monogenic expression

significantly increased 3.89-fold in the 4,M71Ca
hemi line, suggesting that increasing the proba-
bility of choice of M71-mCherry affects the
endogenous RNA levels of M71 as well. The level
of M71-mCherry RNA is significantly increased by
�12-fold when compared to M71-GFP levels
within the 4,M71Ca hemi line and by �45-fold
when compared to M71-GFP levels in the WT.

 (Figure 2). In addition, confocal imaging of the OB of these
animals reveals co-convergence of Cherry-positive and endoge-
nous GFP-positive axons onto the same isotypic M71 glomer-
ulus (Figure 2), showing that OSNs expressing the M71 trans-
gene have the same axonal identity as endogenous M71 OSNs
(represented by the GFP-tagged mutation). Axonal identity
strictly correlates with the most abundant OR expressed in an
OSN (Bozza et al., 2002), thus it is unlikely that other ORs are en-
riched in 4,M71Ca OSNs. Moreover, it is improbable that the
level of M71 RNA transcripts is elevated in the 4,M71Ca OSNs
as they coalesce with M71-GFP axons; this is consistent with
our previous observations that axons of OSNs expressing
MOR23 from the 9x19 transgene co-converge into the same
glomeruli as axons of OSNs expressing MOR23 from the endog-
enous locus (Vassalli et al., 2011) and our acute awareness that
subtle changes to OR levels have dramatic effects on axon iden-
tity (Zhang et al., 2012).
In Vivo SynaptopHluorin Imaging of Glomerular Activity
Our MouSensor approach provides us with the opportunity to
answer a long-standing question in the field of olfaction: What
is the effect of increasing axonal input to a single glomerulus
on odor responses and behavior?
Because the M71 OR is dorsally expressed in the OB, any
cloned OR using the M71 transgenic backbone will coalesce
its axons onto dorsally located glomeruli, which makes them
accessible for optical imaging. To functionally examine the trans-
genic M71 projections in the OB, we imaged odor-evoked activ-
ity from the OBs of mice expressing the genetically encoded ac-
tivity reporter synaptopHluorin (SpH) in all mature OSNs (Bozza
et al., 2004). We recorded from mice that were either hemi or
homo for 4,M71Ca (gene-targeted M71-GFP is out crossed)
and heterozygous for SpH and identified the fluorescent
glomeruli by thinning the bone overlying the OB. We used nine
different M71-selective ligands from ex vivo analysis of geneti-
cally defined M71 OSNs in gene-targeted mice (Zhang et al.,
2012): three of these ligands produced robust responses by
SpH imaging: Acetophenone (ACP), 4-Methylacetophenone
(4MACP), and 2,4-Dimethylacetophenone (24dMACP) when
delivered at different odor dilutions (in nitrogen [N2]) varying be-
tween 0% and 15% (Figures 3 and S2).
M71 Ligands Show the Same Efficacy but Different
Apparent Affinity in Hemizygous 4,M71Ca Animals
In 4,M71Ca hemi animals, the average highest (dF/F)max is
3.63% for ACP (n = 7 glomeruli at 1.33 mM), 4.48% for 4MACP
(n = 9 at 0.69 mM), and 4.15% for 24dMACP (n = 7 at 0.66 mM).
These results show that all three compounds cause a similar ef-
ficacy (i.e., average (dF/F)max: maximum response obtained by
a compound) in terms of M71 OR activation (a one-way ANOVA
comparing the highest (dF/F)max values between hemi animals
did not reveal any significant differences). However, the apparent
affinity of the M71 OR for 4MACP and 24dMACP is significantly
higher than ACP since the latter two compounds start activating
the M71 glomerulus at a lower concentration (Figures 4 and S2,
triangles). For example, when delivered at the same concentra-
tion (i.e., �0.70 mM), efficacy for ACP (0.73%, n = 4) is significantly
lower than the efficacy for both 4MACP (4.48%, n = 9, p < 0.0001)
and 24dMACP (4.15%, n = 7, p < 0.0001). Hence, similar odor ef-
ficacy is observed at lower concentrations for both 4MACP and
24dMACP when compared to ACP responses in the hemi animals
(Figures 4 and S2).
Increasing the Number of OSNs Expressing M71
Changes the Efficacy for Both High- and Low-Affinity
Ligands
In 4,M71Ca homo animals, the highest efficacy for ACP is 4.57%
(n = 14 at 2.66 mM), 3.82% for 4MACP (n = 16 at 0.69 mM), and
4.92% for 24dMACP (n = 7 at 0.44 umM). To assess the influence
of both genotype and concentration on the (dF/F)max, we per-
formed a two-way ANOVA statistical analysis for each odor data-
set. For all odors tested, we see a significant effect of the concen-
tration on the response; ACP: p = 0.0002, 4MACP: p = 0.0003,
and 24dMACP: p < 0.0001. For ACP and 24dMACP, we also
see a significant effect of the genotype on the response, i.e.,
ACP: p = 0.008 and 24dMACP: p = 0.0018. However, the interac-
tion between genotype and concentration is not significantly
different for both odors. This observation can be explained by
the fact that we only see significant differences between hemi
and homo at specific concentrations of both ACP and 24dMACP
and not at all concentrations tested (Figure 4, boxed). Indeed,
when ACP is delivered at 0.71 mM in the homo group, the efficacy
is 3.00% (n = 6), which is significantly higher (p < 0.05) than
the response at the same concentration in the hemi group
(0.73%, n = 4), reflecting a change in apparent affinity for this
ligand when increasing the number of M71 expressing neurons.
Moreover, at the highest ACP concentration we delivered (i.e.,
2.66 mM), the homo response is also significantly higher than
the hemi response (4.57%, n = 14 versus 3.46%, n = 9,
p < 0.05). For 24dMACP, we see a significant increase in efficacy
at 0.44 mM (4.92% [n = 7] versus 2.92% [n = 4], p < 0.01) when
comparing the homo and the hemi group. In addition, the average
efficacy (of all concentrations and odors) is significantly different
between 24dMACP and 4MACP in homozygous animals (4.92%
versus 3.83%, p = 0.0272), even though they show practically
the same dose response in the hemi group (Figures 4 and S2).
Thus, further increasing the number of neurons (from hemi
to homo) expressing the M71 OR changes the efficacy of
24dMACP, empirically identifying it as the higher-affinity ligand.
In conclusion, given a defined number of OSNs expressing
M71, saturation of the glomerular response is reached at certain
concentrations of a given odor. However, this saturation
response is not determined by a specific subset of OSNs ex-
pressing one OR type. In our study, the use of an in vivo anesthe-
tized preparation using SpH imaging is sufficient to support our
observation that 4,M71Ca glomeruli are functional and that
more neurons increase glomerular response. There are no pub-
lished studies that systematically examine the effects of anes-
thetics on SpH imaging, which is likely a more accurate repre-
sentation of OSN response since its signals are clearly based
on synaptic vesicle fusion while the signals for intrinsic signal im-
aging are a bit more ambiguous. It is unlikely that unstable anes-
thesia is the basis for the observed changes in glomerular activa-
tion, but rather it is more likely a consequence of interglomerular
circuitry, which has been shown to exhibit lateral effects on
glomeruli within the region (Wilson and Mainen, 2006). Since
1118
Cell Reports 16, 1115–1125, July 26, 2016
 SpH imaging reflects only the activity of OSNs, the lateral inhibi-
tion from neighboring glomeruli associated with changes in odor
concentration may produce a sudden decrease in fluorescence
in some glomeruli while others become active. By contrast, ex-
periments in awake-behaving animals are highly susceptible to
a variety of top-down signals from higher brain regions (Blauvelt
et al., 2013). These centrifugal signals originate from various
brain regions and can clearly modify the odor response (Liu
et al., 2015; Rothermel et al., 2014), which in turn alters or could
potentially mask different aspects of the pure OSN odorant
evoked signal, which we are testing here.
Ex Vivo versus In Vivo Ligand Profiling
In our setup, odors are delivered from the headspace of odor
saturator vials containing 99% pure odorants and flow-diluted
with air (N2) prior to delivery to the anesthetized animal. The
molar vapor concentration (mM) reaching the animal’s nose is

Menthone [M]) elicit an M71 response through ex vivo patch
clamping of dendritic knobs when delivered in liquid phase.
We only observed glomerular activity with ACP, 4MACP, and
24dMACP. There are two reasons for these findings: the odor
is not delivered at a high enough concentration and/or the odor
may not generate a high enough activation within OSNs. We
find that the minimal Ps necessary to be able to elicit a response
in vivo is 0.0811 mmHg (which is the Ps of 24dMACP; Figure S3).
4MOHACP (a high responder ex vivo; Ps = 0.0133 [< 0.0811]
mmHg) and BA (a low responder ex vivo that has the highest

 Ps of all odors tested; = 1.0100 mmHg at 25�; Figure S3) do not
show glomerular activation in vivo. Hence, we suggest that when
the minimal Ps requirement is met, a minimum current amplitude
(pA) M71 response (ex vivo) is necessary for an odor to activate
M71 glomeruli in our SpH imaging setup; this is the so-called
‘‘sweet spot’’ for generating an in vivo response (black dashed
line in Figure S3). To further test this hypothesis, we imaged
one additional 4,M71Ca hemi animal with two extra M71
ligands (i.e., Propiophenone [PP] and 2-Hydroxyacetophenone
[2OHACP]; Figure S3) that generate similar responses ex vivo
when delivered in liquid, but have a different Ps (PP: 0.149000
and 2OHACP: 0.07020, respectively); only 2OHACP elicited a
response in our hands (data not shown), even though it has a
lower Ps. This suggests that 2OHACP is a better ligand, which
reinforces our point that the Ps must be considered when as-
sessing the strength of a ligand; thus, the best in vivo odors
will have the combination of maximum ex vivo responses and
lowest Ps value. For the M71 OR, it is 24dMACP.

Odor Detection Threshold in a
Two-Bottle Discrimination
Behavioral Task
Sensitivity studies performed in Wistar
neonate and adult rats have shown that
the highest sensitivity to an odor (lowest
threshold) correlates with the highest
OSN density in the MOE (Kraemer and
Apfelbach, 2004). Therefore, we assessed
whether detection of the most robust
M71 ligand is amplified in our 4,M71Ca
MouSensor line. We use an avoidance
task in which the odorant 24dMACP is
added to drinking water and becomes an
aversive stimulus associated with injec-
tion of lithium chloride (LiCl), a compound
known to induce gastric malaise (Cheng
et al., 2013). We chose to use 24dMACP
because SpH imaging with this odor
produced the greatest responses of any
odor tested at low concentrations and
this level could be altered with increasing numbers of M71 ex-
pressing neurons. After conditioning homo 4,M71Ca animals
and their WT littermates to water containing a 10�4 dilution of
24dMACP, the animals are given the choice between plain water
and water with decreasing concentrations of 24dMACP (10�4,
10�6, 5 3 10�7, and 10�7). Note that all tested animals are homo-
zygous for M71-GFP, so even WT ones have a functional M71OR.
The results are presented as a preference index (PI) for the
odorized water for each group of animals, which is calculated
as the amount of the odorized water consumed divided by the to-
tal amount of liquid (odor and no-odor water) consumed over a
24-hr time period (Figure 5A). A PI of 50% reflects no preference
of the animal. After conditioning, both WT and 4,M71Ca homo
animals show a clear aversion toward 10�4 and 10�6 dilutions
of 24dMACP reflected through an average PI for 24dMACP.
However, when 24dMACP is delivered at 10�7, all animals fail
to detect the presence of the odor with an average PI of
45.38% for the WT (n = 8) and 58.76% for the homozygous
1120
Cell Reports 16, 1115–1125, July 26, 2016
 animals (n = 8). This suggested that if the sensitivity of these M71
MouSensors were changed, the threshold would be between
10�6 and 10�7. Indeed, the PI of the WT group is significantly
higher than the PI of the mutants at dilution 5 3 10�7 (55.32%
versus 28.83%, p < 0.05), showing that while the WT fail to detect
the odor at 5 3 10�7, the MouSensors still show aversion
behavior and thus still smell 24dMACP. Importantly, the WT an-
imals also show a lower PI for the odorized water at 10�4 than at
5 3 10�7 (9.88% versus 55.32%, p < 0.001), indicating that the
behavioral difference is most likely a result of the increased abil-
ity of the MouSensors to detect the odor rather than a learning
deficiency in the WT (Figure 5A, gray bars). As a reference, a
10�6 dilution of 24dMACP corresponds to 6.46 mM, a concentra-
tion that can be easily detected by both homo and WT animals
and does not cause an aversive response by itself (the PIs for
drinking water containing 10�6 of 24dMACP for naive, uncondi-
tioned mice are as follows: WT: 60% ± 7.72 [n = 5] and homo:
59%. ± 1.94 [n = 5]). In our imaging studies, non-M71 glomeruli

could respond to ACP, 24dMACP, and
4MACP; however, response rates for
24dMACP were more robust for M71
and did not easily desensitize, suggesting
that for a given ligand-OR pair, behavioral differences can be
observed.
M71 MouSensors Do Not Have a Monoclonal Nose
Given the fact that the 4,M71Ca MouSensor animals express
the M71 OR in �1%–2% of the their OSNs, our transgenic
M71 line is different from the animals generated by Fleischmann
et al. (2008), where the neural representation of odors was
altered significantly by decreasing expression of most ORs by
95% and replacing them with M71, creating animals with a
monoclonal nose. Despite their observation that ACP (weakly)
activated most OSNs and glomeruli, odor discrimination and
performance in associative learning tasks is impaired in these
animals. One possible explanation for this behavior is that broad
uniform activation (such as in the monoclonal nose) may cause
lateral inhibition through intricate feedback mechanisms (at the
level of detection and/or perception) and ACP may be detected
as olfactory ‘‘noise.’’ In this regard, many small glomeruli could
Cell Reports 16, 1115–1125, July 26, 2016
1121
 be disadvantageous compared to fewer very large glomeruli
(which are observed in our 4,M71Ca line) and patterned activa-
tion may be necessary for signal detection. On the other hand,
by reducing the representation of endogenous OR genes by
20-fold, they may have ablated the high-affinity OR for ACP as
well (e.g., Olfr145; von der Weid et al., 2015). The latter explana-
tion is supported by the fact that we, and others (Zhang et al.,
2012), have shown that ACP is not the best ligand for M71. In
support of this notion, Nguyen and Ryba (2012) showed that
overrepresentation of the I7 OR in mice does increase their
sensitivity to a high affinity odor, octanal.
MouSensor: A Versatile Platform
To assess the effect of further increasing the number of multimers
as a ubiquitous enhancer on the number of OSNs choosing to ex-
press any cloned OR, we additionally created MouSensors con-
taining five 21-mers for two mouse ORs, M71, and MOR122-2. All
founders for 5,M71C (6/6) and one germline animal, 5,M71Ca,

several stable glomeruli are formed in the OB (see

show high levels of M71 expression (Table
S1) and form glomeruli in the bulb (Figures
6B and S4). In addition, all five germline
animals for 5,MOR122-2 show high levels
of expression for MOR122-2, three of
which are shown in Figure S5. Based
on our TGV calculations using 5,M71Ca
sections (Bressel et al., 2016), we find
that adding an extra 21-mer to the M71
MouSensor
transgene
increases
the
number of OSNs expressing the M71 by
1.5-fold to about 1.6% of the total OSN
population in hemi animals (Figures 6A
and 6B). Importantly, this increased num-
ber appears to be a result of multimeriza-
tion and not of increased copy number of
the transgene in the genome (�16 times
for 5x21 M71 versus �15 for the 4x21 M71 transgene; Table
S2). In addition, using 35 coronal cryosections from the MOE of
6.5-week-old 5,M71C hemi animals, we did not observe any
coexpression of 52 green cells among a large population of red
cells (too numerous to get an accurate count; Figure 6B). These
data show that adding five 21-mers maintains singular gene
expression in OSNs. Based on current models of singular gene
choice, this choice enhancer can still be suppressed in a large
number of neurons and should be a target of silencing in
non-cherry cells. We now have a model system for testing the
role of CDSs or other genomic sequences for its capacity to be
silenced (Magklara et al., 2011).
To compare specific odorant sensitivity between the 5,M71Ca
and the 4,M71Ca line, we performed the two-bottle discrimina-
tion behavioral task with 24dMACP as described above (Fig-
ure 5B). In summary, we find that at dilution 5 3 10�7 the average
PI of the 5,M71Ca group (n = 9) is 19.62%, which is significantly
(p < 0.01) lower than the PI of the WT group (n = 8; 55.32%). Even
1122
Cell Reports 16, 1115–1125, July 26, 2016
 though we observe the same but slightly more significant 0.3-log
decrease in odorant detection threshold in the 5,M71Ca line, it
is important to mention that we used 5,M71Ca hemi animals,
which have �1.6% of their OSNs expressing M71 (similar to the
4,M71Ca homo animals with �2% M71 expressing OSNs).
It is important to note that we are not performing precise odor-
thresholding based on number of OSNs. However, it would be
interesting to develop a series of M71 neuronal representations
and determine how their glomerular responses and behavioral
changes correlate. In addition, it is unlikely that our results are
due to increased OSN responses from associative learning as
the vast excess of M71 OSNs far outnumbers any change previ-
ously observed from this learning paradigm (Kass et al., 2013).
Decode Human Olfaction
Tofurther evaluate the versatility of this platform, we have cloned a
human OR using the 5x21 M71 transgenic backbone and suc-
cessfully increased the probability of choice of expression of
OR1A1. Both germline animals (5,OR1A1C b and d) show robust
expression of the human OR1A1 receptor in the MOE and stable
glomerularformationintheOB(oneofwhichisshowninFigures6C
and S5). Real-time qPCR reveals a �12-fold increase of OR1A1
RNA in the 5,OR1A1Cb hemi animals when compared to the
M71 RNA levels in the 4,M71Ca hemi line, which translates into
anestimatedtotalof�13%ofOSNsexpressingthisOR(assuming
a total of 10 million OSNs in 8-week-old animals). Again, omp
levels were not changed. Clearly, the representation of some
ORs must be decreased to explain this equilibrium (Serizawa
et al., 2003). As was observed with the 4,M71Ca line, we find
that monoallelic expression remains intact even in a MouSensor
line containing large numbers of OSNs expressing OR1A1, by
crossing the 5,OR1A1Cb to the M71-GFP line. None of the red
axons (expressing OR1A1) coalesce onto green glomeruli (ex-
pressing M71); instead both ORs project their axons to distinct
glomeruli (Figure S6). In addition, in vivo SpH imaging (data not
shown) of the OR1A1Cb line also shows functional glomerular
activation with its known ligand (�)-Carvone (Saito et al., 2009).
In the 4,M71Ca homo animals and 5,M71Ca hemi animals, a
mere 2-log increase in M71 expressing OSNs leads to a signifi-
cant 0.3-log change in threshold. Therefore, we hypothesize
that further increasing the neuronal representation of specific
ORs may decrease detection thresholds even more. We have
tested this hypothesis using our established two-bottle behav-
ioral avoidance task with the 5,OR1A1Cb MouSensors (Fig-
ure 5C). We conditioned 5,OR1A1Cb hemi animals (n = 12)
and their (WT) non-transgenic littermates (n = 7) to water contain-
ing a 10�4 dilution of (�)-Carvone. For 4 consecutive days, ani-
mals were given the choice between plain water and water
with decreasing (10�4, 10�6, 10�7, and 10�8) dilutions of (�)-Car-
vone (Figure 5C). Both groups (WT and hemi) show clear aver-
sion toward a 10�4 dilution of (�)-Carvone (average PI WT =
6.17% and average PI hemi = 10.26%), reflecting successful
conditioning. Both WT (average PI = 55.52%) and hemi (average
PI = 47.88%) cannot detect a 10�8 dilution of (�)-Carvone.
At 10�6 and 10�7, however, there is a clear difference in detec-
tion between WT and hemi (10�6: average PI WT = 27.65%
versus average PI hemi = 11.38, p < 0.01 and 10�7: average PI
WT = 53.88% versus average PI hemi = 30.24, p < 0.05). These
findings indicate that expressing OR1A1 in about 13% of the
OSNs translates into a 2-log decrease in (�)-Carvone detection
thresholds. However, a delicate balance must exist between cell
number and sensitivity (Fleischmann et al., 2008). Again, the WT
animals show significantly lower PIs for the odorized water at
10�4 than at 10�6 (6.17% versus 27.65%, p < 0.01) and at
10�7 (6.17% versus 53.88%, p < 0.0001), indicating that the
behavioral difference is most likely a result of the increased
ability of the mutants to detect the odor rather than a learning
deficiency in the WT (Figure 5C). In addition, we find that
5,OR1A1Cb hemi and WT (n = 5 for both groups) do not show
detection threshold differences toward a non-OR1A1 ligand after
being conditioned toward 24dMACP (data not shown), which
proves that the effect we observe is ligand-specific.
Conclusions
We observe that placing specific HD elements in close proximity
to OR genes favors dramatically increasing the probability that
OR promoters are chosen. It has not escaped our attention
that the MouSensor transgenic platform is an invaluable tool to
further study and refine the mechanisms of singular gene choice
and axonal identity. Being able to generate any OR MouSensor
opens up an array of translational applications as well. We
have produced biosensors with an enhanced inherent sense of
smell, which can be applied to address global health and safety
challenges such as identification of explosives, contraband
searches, and odor-based disease diagnosis (He et al., 2015).
Moreover, training of these MouSensors, or for that matter, Rat
or DogSensors, in odor-detection tasks will be significantly
shorter and more efficient because of the selective amplification
of detection for a given subset of odors. In addition, the possibil-
ity to express human ORs in large numbers of mouse OSNs us-
ing the MouSensor technology provides a breakthrough in vivo
approach to finally crack the olfactory code.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Subjects
Mice used in this study were bred and maintained in the Laboratory Animal Fa-
cility of Hunter College, CUNY. The Hunter College IACUC approved all proce-
dures. Animal care and procedures were in accordance with the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NHHS Publication No. [NIH] 85-23). The
omp-synaptopHluorin mice were a kind gift from Dr. Thomas Bozza (North-
western University, Chicago).
MouSensor Transgene
Using the M71 transgene backbone as described in Vassalli et al. (2002) and
Rothman et al. (2005), including 485 bp of the M71 promoter upstream of
the transcription start site (TSS) (Figure 1), we created a modular version of
this transgenic vector such that any number of a 21-bp singular gene choice
enhancer can be shuttled into the NheI site at position �485. Any OR CDS
of interest can be cloned into the AscI site, and any IRES-Reporter cassette
can be cloned into the PacI site. An internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) allows
for bicistronic translation and simultaneous expression of a reporter gene. The
transgenic animals that express the nx21-OR-IRES-Reporter transgenes are
referred to as MouSensors. A detailed description of the x21 cloning strategy
is provided in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Genotyping
Presence of 4X21-M71-IRES-tauCherry transgene was assessed by PCR by
scoring for the tauCherry gene with the following primers: FWD: 50-CCCTGGA
Cell Reports 16, 1115–1125, July 26, 2016
1123
 CAACATCACAC-30 and REV 50-CCCTCCATGTGCACCTTGAAGCGCA-30. To
distinguish between hemi and homo 4,M71Ca animals, we used a real-time
qPCR method that was previously described (D’Hulst et al., 2013). Presence
of the M71-IRES-tauGFP gene-targeted allele was determined by using
primers to detect GFP: FWD 50-CCCTGGACAACATCACAC-30 and REV 50-
CGTTTACGTCGCCGTCCAGCTC-30 and primers to detect the WT M71
allele with FWD 50-CCGCACTGGACAAAACACTGAGGAG-30 and REV 50-
CTGTTTCCTGTTCAGAGTTGGGTG-30, allowing us to distinguish between
WT, hemi, and homo animals.
Olfactometry
Odors (Sigma Aldrich) were delivered using a custom built olfactometer
controlled by an Arduino board (https://www.arduino.cc/) with custom
shields (http://mylabtime.blogspot.com) operating Teflon solenoids (Neptune
Research) and connected to two mass flow controllers (Alicat Scientific) to
dilute the clean air (N2, max flow is 2 Lpm) and to dilute the odorized air
(max flow is 300 SCCM). N2 was used as the vapor carrier to avoid oxidation.
Odor concentrations are expressed as % dilutions of saturated vapor and as
molar saturated vapor concentration (mM s.v.), calculated using published va-
por pressures at 25�C (US EPA, Estimation Programs Interface Suite, v.4.0
[Pacifico et al., 2012]). Flow diluted odors were delivered at 2 Lpm mixed prior
to the delivery site with air odorized with varying dilutions of odorant taken from
the saturated headspace of pre-cleaned amber vials with white polypropylene
closures and septum (J.G. Finneran) containing 99% pure odorants. To avoid
contamination of the olfactometer, odorized air was never passed through the
Teflon valves. Instead, odors were mixed with N2 in T-shaped mixing cham-
bers (Neptune Research) and delivered to the animal’s nose using an Arduino
controlled vacuum system. Odorized streams carrying different odors did not
come into contact. Output of the olfactometer was calibrated using the tracer
odor Pinene and a photoionization detector (PID; Aurora Scientific).
In Vivo SpH Imaging
Mice 8–12 weeks old were anesthetized using Ketamine (100 mg/kg)/Xylazine
(5 mg/kg) and maintained with Isoflurane (0.8% in O2) and immobilized using
a stereotactic head-holding device (Narishige). Optical signals for SpH and
Cherry were recorded using an ANDOR Neo 5.5 sCMOS camera connected
to a NIKON AZ100 epifluorescence microscope (NIS Elements) with a 43
objective (numerical aperture 0.4). Excitation wavelengths of 475 nm for SpH
and 575 nm for Cherry and emission of 520 nm for SpH and 635 nm for Cherry
were used to obtain images of the dorsolateral bulb through thinned skull over-
laying the bulb of a freely breathing animal. Each imaging trial consisted of a
pre-odor (3 s), odor (4 s), and post-odor (4 s) acquisition, with a total acquisition
time per trial of 14 s (including 3 s of valve switch delay). Using serial code, the
Arduino controlling the olfactometer was integrated in the NIS Elements soft-
ware, so that the entire image acquisition sequence and flow-diluted odor de-
livery is controlled by the microscope’s software (NIS Elements). Two-way
ANOVA and Student’s t tests were used for statistical analysis. Image process-
ing is described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Olfactory Behavior Test
A two-bottle discrimination test was performed as previously described (Wy-
socki et al., 1977). Mice 8 weeks old were individually housed and given
food ad libitum but restricted access to saccharin-phthalic acid solution
(2.1 3 10�2 M sodium saccharin and 10�3 M phthalic acid [pH 6.5; SSPA])
for 1 hr twice a day for 2 days before the assay begins. This ensures mice
would commence drinking the solution during the conditioning. On day 3 (con-
ditioning day), mice are exposed to the SSPA solution with 10�4 dilution of
odorized water for 10 min. Immediately after, they are injected with LiCl intra-
peritoneally (15 ml/g body weight of a 0.6 M solution) to induce the aversive
malaise and lethargy state. After 2 hr, mice are returned to their home cage
and given access to two bottles of drinking water; they are given the choice be-
tween SSPA solution containing a 10�4 dilution of the odor versus the non-
odorized SSPA solution. During the following 3 days, every 24 hr, the location
of the bottles is reversed and the concentration of the odorized solution is
decreased to 10�6, 10�7, and 0.5 3 10�6, respectively. Every day both bottles
are weighed to determine the amount of liquid consumed. A PI was calculated
as the amount of odorized solution consumed divided by the total amount of
water solution consumed for each mouse for every 24-hr test period at each
odor concentration. A t test was performed to test statistical significance,
assuming two-tailed distribution and two-sample unequal variance. Values
are mean ± SEM and are plotted on a log scale. Animals (both WT and trans-
genic) that did not seem to be conditioned after LiCl injections (showing a PI for
24dMACP higher than 20% at 10�4) were excluded from our analysis (i.e., four
WT and two homo). Student’s t tests were used for statistical analysis of the
data.

were euthanized at 8–12 weeks of age and OB tissue was processed for his-
