Abstract
Depression, stress, and diet can all alter inflammation. This double-blind, randomized crossover 
study addressed the impact of daily stressors and a history of major depressive disorder (MDD) on 
inflammatory responses to high-fat meals. During two separate 9.5 hour admissions, 58 healthy 
women (38 breast cancer survivors and 20 demographically-similar controls), mean age 53.1 
years, received either a high saturated fat meal or a high oleic sunflower oil meal. The Daily 
Inventory of Stressful Events assessed prior day stressors and the Structured Clinical Interview for 
DSM-IV evaluated MDD. As expected, for a woman with no prior day stressors, C-reactive 
protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and 
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) were higher following the saturated fat meal than

 the high oleic sunflower oil meal after controlling for pre-meal measures, age, trunk fat, and 
physical activity. But if a woman had prior day stressors, these meal-related differences 
disappeared – because the stressors heightened CRP, SAA, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 responses to 
the sunflower oil meal, making it look more like the responses to the saturated fat meal. In 
addition, women with an MDD history had higher post-meal blood pressure responses than those 
without a similar history. These data show how recent stressors and an MDD history can 
reverberate through metabolic alterations, promoting inflammatory and atherogenic responses.
Introduction
Adherence to a Mediterranean-type diet can reduce the risk for depression, cardiovascular 
disease, type 2 diabetes, and total mortality (1–4). Reduced inflammation may be the 
cornerstone for the Mediterranean diet’s benefits (5–8).
The central fat source in the Mediterranean diet, olive oil, appears to be a key anti-
inflammatory dietary component (8, 9). Indeed, a meta-analysis concluded that olive oil 
interventions lowered CRP and interleukin 6 (IL)-6 compared to control conditions (9). The 
major dietary fatty acids in the North American diet are palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid 
found in meat and dairy products, and the monounsaturated oleic acid, the main fatty acid in 
olive oil, and many vegetable oils (10).
Saturated fatty acids trigger proinflammatory signaling pathways (11). For example, 
palmitic acid activated toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to nuclear transcription factor κB 
(NF-κB) signaling and increased gene expression of IL-6, IL-8, vascular cell adhesion 
molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in contrast, the 
monounsaturated palmioleate did not have inflammatory sequelae (11). A meal made with 
butter, a rich source of saturated fatty acids, activated NF-κB in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells and also increased sICAM-1 concentrations, but a meal with olive oil, a 
rich source of oleic acid, did not (12). Palmitate-stimulated monocytes also fuel ICAM-1 
expression in endothelial cells via an IL-1 signaling pathway (13).
High saturated fat meals raise adhesion molecule concentrations while monounsaturated fat 
meals lower concentrations (14). For example, high palmitate milkshakes boosted sICAM-1 
levels while olive oil milkshakes decreased sICAM-1 (14). Similarly, a high-palmitic fatty 
acid oil breakfast heightened post-meal sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, but a refined olive oil 
breakfast lowered their concentrations (15). Postprandial sICAM-1 levels were amplified by 
a 12-week high saturated fat diet and reduced by a monounsaturated fat diet (16).
These meal-related differences are important because adhesion molecules play a central role 
in the development of atherosclerosis and diabetes (17–23). Plasma sICAM-1 reflects a 
more generalized inflammatory process, while sVCAM-1 appears to be a better indicator of 
plaque burden (19). In healthy people sICAM-1 serves as a more reliable prognostic 
indicator of cardiovascular disease than sVCAM-1, but sVCAM-1 better predicts 
cardiovascular events among patients with atherosclerotic disease than sICAM-1 (17–19). 
Furthermore, adhesion molecules and inflammation are associated with an increased risk of

 hypertension (24, 25), and monounsaturated fat interventions have reduced blood pressure 
(26, 27).
Elevated sICAM-1 levels also predict type II diabetes (20–23). For example, data from the 
Nurses’ Health Study showed that sICAM-1 independently predicted incident diabetes (21). 
In a large population-based prospective, sICAM-1 levels were higher among those 
participants who developed diabetes than in those who did not (20).
In addition to these dietary fat influences, depression and stressors can also boost NF-κB 
signaling, thus augmenting inflammation and increasing adhesion molecule concentrations 
(1, 28–30). For example, sICAM-1 levels were higher among all 18 physicians following an 
academic oral presentation compared to their own values two hours earlier, as well as their 
data from parallel assessments obtained on a control day (31). Comparisons of 22 patients 
who developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following a myocardial infarction (MI) 
and 22 who did not develop post-MI PTSD showed that those with PTSD had higher 
concentrations of sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 at rest, as well as following a trauma-specific 
interview than their PTSD-free counterparts (32). Among patients who had experienced a 
recent acute coronary syndrome, sICAM-1 levels were higher among those with major 
depression than those who did not meet criteria (33). Young adults with major depression 
had higher levels of sICAM-1 than nondepressed controls (34), and heightened sICAM-1 
concentrations have also been found in healthy adults with elevated depressive symptoms 
(35–38).
People with a history of depression experience more major and minor stressors than those 
without a similar history, and past depression can also boost emotional reactivity to stressors 
(39, 40). Thus a mood disorder history could act synergistically with stress through multiple 
pathways.
Indeed, other data from this same sample of healthy breast cancer survivors and controls 
demonstrated that women with a history of depression who had also experienced more prior 
day stressors had a higher peak postprandial triglyceride response than other participants 
(41). Similarly, in our subsequent study with married couples that included the same high-fat 
meals, men and women who had a mood disorder history and who also displayed more 
hostile behaviors during the laboratory marital conflict discussions had lower post-meal 
resting energy expenditure, higher insulin, and higher peak triglyceride responses than other 
participants (42).
Accordingly, this secondary analysis assessed the impact of prior day stressors and past 
depression on metabolic responses to two different high-fat meals (41). We expected that our 
high saturated fat meal would increase inflammatory markers and adhesion molecules, but 
not our high oleic sunflower oil meal (14–16). We also hypothesized that both prior day 
stressors and an MDD history would be associated with higher post-meal concentrations of 
inflammatory markers and adhesion molecules.

 METHODS AND MATERIALS
Design and Overview
This double-blind, randomized crossover study assessed metabolic responses following 
high-fat meals. Women received one high saturated fat meal and one high oleic sunflower oil 
meal during two separate 9.5 hour Clinical Research Center (CRC) visits spaced 1–4 weeks 
apart. The Ohio State institutional review board approved this study, and each participant 
provided informed consent.
After fasting for 12 hours, a catheter was inserted in the arm on admission. Women had 20 
minutes to eat the meal. Blood samples were obtained before and 2, 4, and 7 hours after the 
meal. Body composition was assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (43).
Participants
The parent study was designed to assess whether a high-fat diet in combination with a 
depression history increased fatigue in post-treatment cancer survivors and benign controls, 
and thus the 58 healthy women included 38 breast cancer survivors and 20 benign controls 
(women who had an initial abnormal mammogram) were recruited from a large 
observational study (41). Exclusions included a history of any other prior cancer, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, symptomatic ischemic heart disease, alcohol/drug abuse, and 
immune-related conditions such as diabetes, autoimmune disease, and major inflammatory 
diseases. Medication exclusions included blood lipid medications, angiotensin type I 
receptor blockers, and medications with major immunological or endocrinological 
consequences, e.g., steroids. We invited 91 women from the large observational study who 
met these criteria to participate; of those, 3 had exclusionary health problems not previously 
identified, 18 declined to participate, and 14 did not respond to our recruitment letter. 
Demographic and laboratory data did not differ between groups with the exception of higher 
sICAM-1 in survivors compared to controls (Table 1). Survivors averaged 27.03 months 
(SD=17.45) since diagnosis and 19.87 months (SD=6.47) since treatment completion. Only 
one participant failed to return for her second visit.
Standardized Pre-Study Meals
Participants were instructed to avoid alcohol use the day before study visits, and any 
strenuous physical activity two days previously (44). They were also asked not to take 
aspirin, vitamins, antioxidants, or other dietary supplements for the 7 days before each 
admission.
On the day before each of the two study visits participants received three standardized meals 
from the CRC’s metabolic kitchen to reduce the variability associated with recent intake. 
Equations from the Dietary Reference Intakes calculated the total kcal requirements for each 
participant based on age, height, weight, and physical activity (45). Macronutrient targets (as 
percent of total energy) for these meals were 54.9 ± 2.68% carbohydrate, 27.6 ±2.13% fat, 
and 17.6 ± 0.95% protein. The fat content was 9.10 ± 1.20 % saturated fats, 9.43 ± 1.55% 
monounsaturated fats, and 7.26 ± 1.25% polyunsaturated fats. Participants ate their last meal

 no later than 7:30 pm the night before admission; the dinner was light and low in fat (44). 
Compliance was good: women consumed 91.83 ± 8.41% of these meals.
Research Meals
Both research meals included eggs, turkey sausage, biscuits, and gravy for a total of 930 
kcals, with 60 grams fat, 59 grams carbohydrate, and 36 grams protein (percent of total kcals 
= 60, 25, 15, respectively). However, the saturated:unsaturated fatty acid ratio varied 
between the meals; the high saturated fat meal contained 16.84 g palmitic and 13.5 g oleic 
(ratio=1.93), compared to 8.64 g palmitic and 31.21 g oleic for the high oleic sunflower oil 
meal (ratio=0.67).
Assays
Serum CRP, serum amyloid A (SAA), sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were measured in duplicate 
with the Vascular Injury Panel 2 Multispot Kit on an MSD Imager 2400 (both Meso Scale 
Discovery, Rockville, MD), following kit instructions. Both samples for each subject were 
analyzed within the same plate, and all plates were from the same kit/lot. The intra-assay 
coefficient of variation (CV) and inter-assay CV for each analyte were: CRP 6.28% and 
7.36%, SAA 4.90% and 3.09%, sICAM-1 4.19% and 6.92%, and sVCAM-1 2.14% and 
5.16%.
Blood Pressure
Blood pressure was assessed using the Critikon Dinamap 1846 SX (GE, Tampa, FL) every 2 
minutes for 20 minutes at baseline, and then every 2 minutes for 10 minutes immediately 
following the meal. Subsequently, 2 readings were taken 2 minutes apart every hour for the 
remainder of the visit.
Interview Data
The mood disorder modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) 
provided data on lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) (46). SCID data 
showed that 29% (n=17) had met MDD criteria. The average time since diagnosis was 8.32 
years (SD=10.94).
The Daily Inventory of Stressful Events (DISE) assessed the number of daily stressors 
within the last 24 hours (47). The transcribed interview responses were rated in a consensus 
meeting using the DISE’s extensive electronic “dictionary” which specifies codable events 
(47). In our sample 31 women reported at least one recent stressor at one visit, 21 at both 
visits, and 6 women reported no stressors.
Questionnaires
Following CRC admission participants completed several questionnaires. The Center for 
Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) assessed depressive symptomatology in 
the last week (48). The Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors 
questionnaire (CHAMPS) assessed the weekly frequency and duration of various physical 
activities (49, 50). These measures have well-established reliability and validity (48–50).

 Statistical methods
The primary analyses used linear mixed models, since these models allow explicit modeling 
of the within-subject correlations due to repeated study visits and repeated measurements 
during each visit.
Demographics and other pre-meal characteristics were compared across groups (cancer, 
control) using two-sample t-tests and chi-square tests for data collected at only one visit 
(e.g., age) and linear mixed models with a random subject effect for data collected at both 
visits (e.g., body mass index). Four primary outcome measures (CRP, SAA, sICAM-1, and 
sVCAM-1) were right-skewed and were natural-log transformed to better approximate 
normality of residuals. Linear mixed effects models were used to model post-meal outcome 
values, with the premeal (fasting) outcome measurement included as a covariate. All models 
included the three-way interaction of group (cancer, control) by meal type by time point and 
all lower-order terms to properly account for the design of the parent study. However, there 
were no significant effects of group (p > 0.2 for all tests) and thus reported results are 
averaged over group.
Of primary interest was the impact of prior day stressors and MDD history on post-meal 
responses. Initial models contained interactions of these predictors with time post-meal 
(categorical) and with meal type; nonsignificant interactions were removed for final models. 
All models further controlled on additional covariates to guard against confounding, 
including age, trunk fat, physical activity (caloric expenditure per week), and study visit 
(first vs. second). Additional models also controlled for menopausal status, but results were 
unchanged, thus final models did not include this factor. To capture the within-subject 
correlations within and across visits, all models included a pair of correlated subject-specific 
random meal effects, which allowed the magnitude of within-subject correlation for the two 
meal types to differ. The Kenward-Roger adjustment to the degrees of freedom was used to 
control type I error (51). All analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.3 (Cary, North 
Carolina).
Results
There were no associations between fasting levels of CRP, SAA, sICAM-1, or sVCAM-1 
and either prior day stressors (p > 0.2 for all tests) or MDD history (p > 0.15 for all tests), 
after controlling for visit, age, trunk fat, and physical activity. Trunk fat was significantly 
positively associated with fasting levels of CRP (p<0.0001), SAA (p = 0.004), and 
sVCAM-1 (p = 0.05), and marginally associated with fasting sICAM-1 (p = 0.09). Each 1 kg 
increase in trunk fat was associated with a 12.7% increase in the geometric mean of CRP, a 
5.0% increase in the geometric mean of SAA, a 1.0% increase in the geometric mean of 
sICAM-1, and a 1.2% increase in the geometric mean of sVCAM-1. Physical activity was 
marginally negatively associated with fasting SAA (p = 0.09), with a 100 kcal increase in 
caloric expenditure associated with a 1.3% decrease in the geometric mean of SAA. Both 
fasting sICAM-1 and fasting CRP were elevated at the first study visit compared to the 
second, with a 9.5% higher geometric mean (p<0.0001) for sICAM-1 and a 21% higher 
geometric mean for CRP (p = 0.06). Age and cancer status were not significantly associated 
with fasting levels of any outcome (p > 0.1 for all tests).

 When modeling the postprandial responses, controlling for pre-meal levels, there were 
significant two-way interactions of prior day stressors by meal type in the models for CRP 
(p = 0.04), sICAM-1 (p = 0.02), and sVCAM-1 (p = 0.05), and a borderline interaction for 
SAA (p = 0.09). Thus the effect of stressors on post-meal inflammation depended on the 
meal type, and differences between the meals depended on a woman’s number of prior day 
stressors. A larger number of stressors was associated with higher levels of postprandial 
CRP, SAA, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 after the high oleic sunflower oil meal but not after the 
high saturated fat meal (Figure 1, Table 2). After the high oleic sunflower oil meal, each 
additional prior day stressor was associated with a 2.9% increase in the geometric mean of 
CRP, a 2.3% increase in the geometric mean of SAA, a 1.7% increase in the geometric mean 
of sICAM-1, and a 2.1% increase in the geometric mean of sVCAM-1. In contrast, after the 
high saturated fat meal there was no significant effect of stressors (Table 2). As shown in 
Figure 1, for a woman with no prior day stressors, post-meal inflammation was higher 
following the high saturated fat meal than the high oleic sunflower oil meal. But having prior 
day stressors shifted the response to the high oleic sunflower oil meal such that it looked like 
the response to the high saturated fat meal. There were no significant effects of MDD history 
on these outcomes (p > 0.07 for all tests).
There were no associations between pre-meal levels of SBP or DBP, and prior day stressors 
(p > 0.15 for all tests) or MDD history (p > 0.15 for all tests), after controlling for visit, age, 
trunk fat, and physical activity. Subjects with MDD history had marginally higher SBP (p = 
0.06) and DBP (p = 0.10).
There were no significant effects of prior day stressors or meal type on the blood pressure 
outcomes (p > 0.25 for all tests). There was a significant main effect of MDD history on 
postprandial DBP (p = 0.05), even after controlling for pre-meal levels. In the post-meal 
period, DBP was higher for subjects with a history of MDD compared to those without 
(Figure 2). There was also a significant interaction between MDD history and time on 
postprandial SBP (p = 0.02) despite controlling for pre-meal levels. Subjects with a history 
of MDD had elevated SBP at most time points, particularly at around 3 hours and 6–7 hours 
post-meal (Figure 2).
Discussion
This study is the first to demonstrate that stressors can heighten inflammatory responses to 
high oleic sunflower oil meals. Importantly, the stress- and depression-related metabolic 
responses to the two meals revealed adverse effects that were not evident when fasting. As 
expected, CRP, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 were higher following the saturated fat meal than 
the high oleic sunflower oil meal. However, a higher number of prior day stressors was 
associated with higher postprandial CRP, SAA, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 after the high oleic 
sunflower oil meal, but not after the high saturated fat meal. Putting it another way, for a 
woman with no prior day stressors, outcomes were higher after the saturated fat meal than 
after the sunflower oil meal. But if a woman had prior day stressors, the differences 
disappeared – because the stressors heightened responses to the sunflower oil meal, making 
it look more like the responses to the saturated fat meal.

 The endothelial activation that was reflected by the heightened post-meal sICAM-1 and 
sVCAM-1 concentrations may also mirror a more chronic inflammatory responsiveness 
associated with atherosclerosis of brain arteries, a process that could itself promote 
depression (33, 52). Among adults with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, higher 
levels of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and soluble Fas in cerebrospinal fluid had a 3.92-fold 
increase in the odds for developing posttraumatic depression at 6 months (53); indeed, 
having any one of these markers above the 75th percentile had a predictive value of 85.7% 
for posttraumatic depression at six months (53). Similarly, among patients treated with 
interferon-α for melanoma, sICAM-1 levels were correlated with the development of 
depressive symptoms during treatment (54). Postmortem studies of depressed older adults 
revealed elevated ICAM-1 expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to 
nondepressed controls (55, 56). ICAM-1 is thought to play a key role in blood-brain barrier 
(BBB) permeability, and enhanced levels of depressive symptoms may reflect greater BBB 
porousness (54). The fact that a Mediterranean diet offers some protection against the 
development of both depressive symptoms and depressive disorders (4, 57, 58) may be 
related to its anti-inflammatory actions (8, 9).
Women with an MDD history had higher post-meal blood pressure responses than those 
without a similar history, with no differences evident in the fasted state; MDD history was 
not related to the inflammatory responses. A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies 
concluded that depression increases the risk of hypertension, an important risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease (59). Other research from this sample has demonstrated that women 
with an MDD history who had also experienced more prior day stressors had a higher peak 
postprandial triglyceride response than other participants (41). Larger post-meal triglyceride 
responses are reliably associated with enhanced cardiovascular risk and the progression of 
atherosclerosis (60–62). Depression has well-established effects on cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality, and these two different meal-related changes highlight previously 
unrecognized depression-sensitive mechanistic pathways (63, 64).
Strengths of our study included control of both the composition and energy content of each 
woman’s diet on the day prior to admission as well as during admission. The only difference 
between the two challenge meals was the fat source. Both meals included 930 kcal and 60 g 
fat, values that are quite comparable to common fast food choices. For example, a Burger 
King Double Whopper with cheese has 990 kcal and 64 g fat, while a Big Mac cheeseburger 
and medium French fries contain 930 kcals and 58 g fat.
It is unclear why, with the addition of a stressor to the high saturated fat meal, there were no 
further increase in levels of CRP, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, while stress-related changes 
were observed in response to the high oleic sunflower oil meal. Speculatively, inflammatory 
markers may have already reached their ceiling level in response to the high saturated fat 
condition, a reasonable possibility because our participants did not have overt signs of 
cardiac disease or other diseases associated with chronically elevated inflammation.
Our two meals, regardless of their fat source, were high in energy and fat, and they included 
refined flour and little fiber. We do not know whether a relatively healthier meal (e.g., 
energy balanced, lower in total fat, higher in polyunsaturated oils and containing more

 protein and fiber with fewer simple carbohydrates) would attenuate the adverse postprandial 
inflammatory and metabolic changes, one limitation. Nonetheless, our study meals reflected 
typical everyday dietary choices because they were designed to mimic common fast food 
meals.
The inclusion of healthy breast cancer survivors could have affected our results, another 
limitation. However, we found no reliable post-meal differences between cancer survivors 
and controls in these analyses, or in other metabolic data from this study (41). We selected 
our healthy survivors using the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as our controls; had we 
used a larger and more representative sample of cancer survivors we might have seen group 
differences related to cancer treatment. Additionally, depressive symptoms did not differ 
between cancer survivors and controls, and the relatively low levels of depressive symptoms 
limited our ability to see depression-related effects.
These data are important because heightened inflammation characterizes a number of 
disorders and systemic diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic 
syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, and psoriasis; each 
of these also features an elevated risk for depression (65, 66). Our data show how recent 
stressors and a depression history can reverberate through these metabolic alterations to fuel 
inflammation, which can, in turn, promote depression.
