Key points
r Fructose-containing sugars, including sucrose and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), have been
implicated in the epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes.
r Few studies have evaluated the impact of perinatal exposure to these sugars on metabolic and
physiological outcomes in the offspring.
r Using a rat model, offspring exposed to a maternal sucrose or HFCS diet during the pre-
natal and/or suckling periods were found to have altered adiposity and liver fat content and
composition at weaning.
r Plasma levels of free fatty acids remained elevated in young adulthood, but consumption of a
control diet following weaning appeared to ameliorate most other effects of perinatal exposure
to a maternal high-sugar diet.
r Guidelines for maternal nutrition should advise limiting consumption of fructose-containing
sugars, and it is particularly important that these recommendations include maternal nutrition
during lactation.
Abstract Perinatal exposure to excess maternal intake of added sugars, including fructose and
sucrose, is associated with an increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in adult life. However,
it is unknown to what extent the type of sugar and the timing of exposure affect these outcomes.
The aim of this study was to determine the impact of exposure to maternal consumption of a 10%
(w/v) beverage containing sucrose or high fructose corn syrup-55 (HFCS-55) during the prenatal
and/or suckling periods on offspring at 3 and 12 weeks, utilising a cross-fostering approach in a
rodent model. Perinatal sucrose exposure decreased plasma glucose concentrations in offspring
at 3 weeks, but did not alter glucose tolerance. Increased adiposity was observed in 3-week-old
offspring exposed to sucrose or HFCS-55 during suckling, with increased hepatic fat content in
HFCS-55-exposed offspring. In terms of specific fatty acids, hepatic monounsaturated (omega-7
and -9) fatty acid content was elevated at weaning, and was most pronounced in sucrose offspring
exposed during both the prenatal and suckling periods, and HFCS-55 offspring exposed during
suckling only. By 12 weeks, the effects on adiposity and hepatic lipid composition were largely
normalised. However, exposure to either sucrose or HFCS-55 during the prenatal period only
was associated with elevated plasma free fatty acids at weaning, and this effect persisted until
12 weeks. This study suggests that the type of sugar and the timing of exposure (prenatal or
suckling periods) are both important for determining the impact on metabolic health outcomes
in the offspring.

Introduction
The global epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) remains a major public health issue.
In 2014, almost 2 billion adults were classified as
overweight or obese (39% and 13% of the world’s
population, respectively), and 9% of adults world-wide
had been diagnosed with T2DM (WHO, 2014). Numerous
epidemiological, clinical and experimental animal studies
have demonstrated that the nutritional environment that
an individual is exposed to before birth and/or in early
infancy is a critical determinant of their risk of developing
obesity and metabolic diseases over their life course
(Hales & Barker, 1992; Mcmillen & Robinson, 2005).
Exposure to maternal obesity or over-nutrition during
critical windows of development is associated with altered
development of key physiological systems, resulting in an
increasedriskofobesityandpoormetabolichealthinadult
life (Taylor & Poston, 2007; Alfaradhi & Ozanne, 2011).
While the negative impacts of early life over-nutrition
have been well described, the role of specific nutritional
components and the critical periods during which
exposure is most detrimental remain poorly understood.
Consumption of excess added sugars, i.e. sugars/syrups
added to foods and beverages as sweeteners, has been
identified as a major factor contributing to the epidemic of
obesity and T2DM (Johnson et al. 2009). This prompted
the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015 to release
recommendations that added sugars should contribute
less than 10%, and preferably less than 5%, to total energy
intake (WHO, 2015). Despite this, a significant proportion
of the population continue to consume considerably
over this amount, with sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)
representing a major contributor to sugar intake (Johnson
et al. 2009). The two added sugars most commonly used
in SSBs are sucrose (fructose/glucose disaccharide 50:50)
and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS; most commonly
HFCS-55; fructose/glucose monosaccharides 55:42). Both
of these sweeteners contain similar amounts of fructose, a
nutrient that has been implicated in the development of
a number of metabolic abnormalities, including insulin
resistance, inflammation, dyslipidaemia and obesity, in
both humans and animals (Lustig, 2013; Regnault et al.
2013; Stanhope et al. 2013; Toop & Gentili, 2016),
but have subtly different amounts of glucose. The key
difference between these sugars, however, is their chemical
structure. Sucrose (a disaccharide) must be hydrolysed
prior to absorption, whereas the fructose and glucose
in HFCS-55 already exist as monosaccharides that can
be absorbed without the need for enzymatic processing,
whichmayhavesignificantimplicationsfortheirintestinal
absorption (Tappy, 2015).
While excess consumption of both sucrose and
HFCS-55 has been associated with the development of
obesity and metabolic disease in adults, much less is
known about the effect of maternal consumption of
these fructose-containing sugars during pregnancy and/or
lactation on the developing offspring. In addition, there
are currently no specific recommendations regarding
maternal consumption of added sugars during pregnancy
or breast-feeding. Rodent studies have begun to shed
light on some of the adverse short- and long-term effects
of developmental exposure to maternal consumption of
pure fructose on the metabolic health of the offspring
(Alzamendi et al. 2010; Vickers et al. 2011; Mukai et al.
2014; Clayton et al. 2015; Rodr´
ıguez et al. 2015, 2016;
Sarı et al. 2015), and this has been the subject of
several reviews (Goran et al. 2013; Regnault et al. 2013;
Sloboda et al. 2014). However, relatively few studies have
investigated the effects of developmental exposure to
fructose-containing sugars, sucrose or HFCS-55 (Bocarsly
etal.2012;D’Alessandroetal.2012,2014;Samuelssonetal.
2013; Kendig et al. 2015). This is important given that
fructose is rarely consumed in isolation, and therefore,
studies investigating sucrose and HFCS-55 are more
physiologically relevant. In addition to the specific nature
of the developmental insult, it is becoming increasingly
clear that the timing of the insult is also critical for
determining its programming effects. A number of rodent
studies have shown that the long-term programming
effects of exposure to a specific nutritional insult during
the prenatal period differs from exposure to the same
insult during suckling (Armitage et al. 2005). Thus,
it is important to determine the effects of exposure
to maternal consumption of fructose-containing sugars
duringtheprenatalandsucklingperiodsalone,inaddition
to investigating the impact of exposure during the entire
perinatal period.
To our knowledge, no previous studies have compared
the effects of exposure to sucrose or HFCS-55 during
specific critical windows of development on the short-
and longer-term metabolic and physiological outcomes
in the offspring. Although studies have shown that
developmental exposure to fructose results in the
accumulation
of
intrahepatic
fat
and/or
increased
expression of hepatic lipogenic genes in offspring (Mukai

significant, as the type of fatty acids stored in the liver, as

metabolism and the risk of developing diseases including
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (Puri et al.
2007). We have previously demonstrated that maternal
consumption of either sucrose or HFCS-55 prior to
and during pregnancy and lactation is associated with
sugar-specific effects in the dam and newborn offspring
(Toop et al. 2015). In the current study we investigated
the separate effects of maternal consumption of sucrose
or HFCS-55 during the prenatal and/or suckling peri-
ods on the short- (3 weeks) and longer-term (12 weeks)
outcomes in the offspring, specifically body weight and
fat mass, glucose tolerance, plasma hormone, lipid and
glucose concentrations, and hepatic lipid content and fatty
acid composition.
Methods
Ethical approval
All procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics
Committee of SA Pathology (approval number 26/12) for
the University of South Australia, and this work complies
with the animal ethics principles and regulations of the
Australian Code for the Care and Use of Animals for
Scientific Purposes. The authors ensured that all steps
were taken to minimise the pain and suffering of the
animals. A total of 90 virgin female and 15 male albino
Wistar rats (8 weeks old) were obtained from Laboratory
AnimalServices(outbredalbinoWistarrats,colonysource
Harlan Sprague Dawley from Indianapolis, IN, USA,
imported 6 November 2008; SA, Australia) and housed
in individually ventilated cages under a 12 h light–dark
cycle at a room temperature of 22°C. Of the 90 female
rodents, 84 were mated over three cohorts, with an
average mating success rate of 90 ± 5%, resulting in 77
successful pregnancies. Of the 77 litters, 74 ± 12% were
successfully cross-fostered to another dam in the same
or different treatment group, resulting in 61 litters across
sevenexperimentalgroups.Adultfemaleandmaleratsand
offspring at 3 and 12 weeks of age were killed by an over-
dose of CO2 followed by cervical dislocation. Newborn
offspring that were unable to be cross-fostered were killed
by decapitation within 48 h of birth.
Experimental design
As described previously (Toop et al. 2015), following
1 week acclimatisation with ad libitum access to standard
laboratory rat chow (Specialty Feeds, Glen Forrest, WA,
Australia; 14 kJ g−1) and water, rats were randomly
assigned to receive a control diet with ad libitum access
to standard laboratory rat chow and water (n = 25 dams),
or ad libitum access to chow and an SSB containing
either 10% (w/v) sucrose (CSR, Victoria, Australia;
n = 19 dams) or HFCS-55 (Nature’s Flavors, Orange, CA,
USA; n = 17 dams), made fresh in the animal facility
using autoclaved water, and replaced every 48 h or when
required (Fig. 1). Dams remained on this diet for at
least 4 weeks prior to mating, and throughout pregnancy
and lactation (Toop et al. 2015). After a minimum of
4 weeks on their respective diets, all dams were mated.
Offspring were born naturally at day 22.4 ± 0.07 of
gestation. Within 24 h of birth, litters were culled to
eight pups per litter, four males and four females where
possible, and all offspring were cross-fostered to create
a total of seven experimental groups: offspring exposed
to a maternal control diet during both the prenatal and
suckling periods (C-C; n = 8 litters), offspring exposed

The C-C offspring were born to a control dam and cross-fostered to
a different control dam (week 0), and these offspring were the
controls for all subsequent analyses. The C-C group was repeated in
both sucrose and HFCS-55 analyses, denoted by the asterisk (∗). In
the sucrose exposure group, S-S offspring were born to a
sucrose-fed dam and cross-fostered to a different sucrose-fed dam;
S-C offspring were born to a sucrose-fed dam and cross-fostered to
a control dam; and C-S offspring were born to a control dam and
cross-fostered to a sucrose-fed dam. In the HFCS-55 exposure group,
H-H offspring were born to an HFCS-55-fed dam and cross-fostered
to a different HFCS-55-fed dam; H-C offspring were born to an
HFCS-55-fed dam and cross-fostered to a control dam; and C-H
offspring were born to a control dam and cross-fostered to an
HFCS-55-fed dam. At 3 weeks, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance
test (IPGTT) was performed on one male and one female offspring
per litter, with a post-mortem conducted 1 day later. Offspring were
weaned and fed a control diet until 12 weeks, when another IPGTT
and post-mortem was conducted.

to a maternal control diet during the prenatal period and
then a maternal HFCS-55 diet during the suckling period
(C-H; n = 9 litters) (Fig. 1).
All pups were weighed every 2 days from birth until
3 weeks of age, at which point two males and two females
(where possible) were weaned onto a control diet with ad
libitum access to standard laboratory rat chow and water.
The weaned offspring were weighed weekly until 12 weeks
of age. At 3 and 12 weeks, one male and one female
per litter were killed with an overdose of CO2 followed
by cervical dislocation. Blood samples were collected via
cardiac puncture, centrifuged at 1419 g for 10 min at 4°C,
then plasma was collected and stored at −80°C. At both
3 and 12 weeks of age, selected internal organs including
the heart, liver, adrenals, kidneys, pancreas and visceral
(retroperitoneal, gonadal and omental depots) and sub-
cutaneous adipose tissue depots were dissected out and
weighed. Liver samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at −80°C for analysis of lipid content and
composition.
Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test
Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs) were
performed on one male and one female offspring per
litter 1 day prior to the post-mortem at 3 and 12 weeks
of age, as described previously (Toop et al. 2015).
Animals were fasted for at least 15 h prior to the
IPGTT, although offspring at 3 weeks of age remained
with the dam during the fasting period and still had
access to breast milk. Blood glucose concentrations were
determined using a hand-held glucometer (FreeStyle
Glucometer; Abbott Diabetes Care, Victoria, Australia)
from a tail vein blood sample (�60 µl). A baseline blood
glucose concentration was determined 10–15 min prior to
commencingtheIPGTT.A50%glucosesolution(2gkg−1;
Phebra, NSW, Australia) was then administered via intra-
peritonealinjection.Tailveinbloodsampleswerecollected
immediately prior to (0 min) and 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 and
120 min after glucose administration for determination
of blood glucose concentration. Area under the glucose
curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoidal rule.
Determination of plasma hormone and metabolite
concentrations
Plasma glucose, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (Thermo
Electron, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and free fatty acid (FFA,
also known as non-esterified fatty acid; WAKO Pure
Chemical Industries Ltd, Osaka, Japan) concentrations
were determined using a Konelab 20X device (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Plasma insulin and
leptin concentrations were measured by immunoassay
with rat insulin (ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH, USA)
and leptin (Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL, USA) kits
according to the manufacturers’ specifications. Inter-
and intra-assay coefficients of variation were < 1% for
all assays. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
was calculated as the difference between total and HDL
cholesterol concentrations.
Determination of hepatic lipid concentration
and composition
Hepatic lipids were extracted according to Folch et al.
(1957) with minor modifications (Bligh & Dyer, 1959;
Tu et al. 2010). Briefly, 50 mg sections of liver from the
right lobe were homogenised in ice-cold 0.9% saline
(Precelleys24, Bertin Technologies, France). Total lipids
were extracted with methanol/chloroform (2:1) and dried
under nitrogen. The remaining residue was weighed to
determine the total extracted lipid content (%) from
the weight of the lipid extract (g) and the weight of
the liver sample (g). Following resuspension in 9:1
chloroform/methanol, the lipid extract was separated by
thin layer chromatography to isolate the FFA, TG and
phospholipid fractions, which were then transmethylated
with 1% H2SO4 in methanol at 70°C for 3 h. The resulting
fatty acid methyl esters from each lipid fraction were then
separated and quantified by gas chromatography (6890;
Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a
capillary column (50 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter)
coated with 0.25 µm film thickness silica (BPX-70;
SGE Analytical Science Pty Ltd, Victoria, Australia),
which was fitted with a flame ionisation detector. The
injector temperature was set at 250°C and the detector
temperature at 300°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas
(35 cm s−1) and the split-ratio was 20:1. Fatty acid methyl
esters were identified based on the retention time and peak
area percentage of the unknown samples to commercial
lipid standards (Nu-Check Prep Inc., Elysian, MN, USA)
using ChemStation software (Hewlett-Packard). From
this, the concentration of total FFA, phospholipid and
TG in the liver were determined, in addition to the
concentration of total saturated fatty acids (SFAs), total,
omega-7 and omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acids

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± SEM. Data were
assessed for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test. The
analysis was split into two groups based on offspring
sugar exposure, in which the C-C offspring were used
as the controls for all analyses: the sucrose exposure group
(C-C, S-S, S-C and C-S offspring) and the HFCS-55
exposure group (C-C, H-H, H-C and H-C) (Fig. 1).
The effects of maternal consumption of sucrose or
HFCS-55 during pregnancy and/or lactation on offspring
body weight at post-mortem, relative organ and tissue
weights, hepatic lipid concentration and composition,
and plasma metabolite and hormone concentrations were
initially determined using two-way ANOVA (analyses
split by sugar exposure, as defined above) with maternal
diet (during pregnancy and/or lactation) and offspring
sex as co-factors. An effect of sex was found for
many of the variables reported, so all data were split
for sex and re-analysed using a one-way ANOVA,
followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test where appropriate.
The statistical significance reported in the tables and
figures summarises the effect of treatment for male or
female offspring for each of the variables reported, as
determined by one-way ANOVA. Differences between
males and females (independent of treatment) identified
by the two-way ANOVA have been identified in the
table and figure legends. The effect of maternal sugar
consumption in the sucrose exposure and HFCS-55
exposure groups during pregnancy and/or lactation on
offspring body weight throughout the study period was
separately determined using a nested repeated-measures
ANOVA. The effect of maternal diet on offspring glucose
concentrations during the IPGTT was determined by
repeated-measures ANOVA, split for sex, with maternal
diet and time as co-factors. The repeated-measures
ANOVA was performed using Stata12 (StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX, USA). All other statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). A probability of < 5% (P < 0.05) was considered
statistically significant in all analyses.
Results
Effects of perinatal sucrose exposure
Body weight and growth. There was no effect of pre-
natal and/or postnatal sucrose exposure on offspring body
weight at any time point between birth and 12 weeks of
age, nose–tail length, abdominal circumference (data not
shown) or body weight at post-mortem at either 3 weeks
(Table 1) or 12 weeks (Table 2).
Organ weights. Female, but not male, offspring pre-
natally exposed to sucrose (S-C) had a lower relative heart
weight compared to S-S offspring, but not C-C offspring,
at 3 weeks of age (Table 1). At 12 weeks, relative heart
weight was lower in both S-C and C-S females compared
to C-C females (Table 2). Relative pancreas weight tended
(P=0.051)tobelowerinC-Sfemalesat3weekscompared
to C-C females, and S-S and C-S males had significantly
lower relative pancreas weights compared to male C-C
offspring at 12 weeks. There were no effects of exposure
to sucrose during either the prenatal and/or the suckling
periodsonrelativeliver,adrenalorkidneyweightsineither
male or female offspring at 3 weeks (Table 1) or 12 weeks
(Table 2) of age.
Body fat mass. Exposure to sucrose during the suckling
period alone (C-S) was associated with increased relative
visceral adipose tissue mass in female, but not male,
offspring at 3 weeks of age compared to C-C offspring,
an effect driven primarily by a significant increase in the
mass of the omental depot (Table 1). There were no other
effects of sucrose exposure during the prenatal or suckling
periods on adipose tissue mass at 3 weeks of age in either
male or female offspring.
There were no persistent effects of sucrose exposure
during the suckling period in female offspring at 12 weeks.
However, 12-week-old females exposed to sucrose during
the prenatal period only (S-C) had a significantly lower
retroperitoneal adipose tissue mass compared to C-C
offspring (Table 2). In males, however, those offspring
exposed during the suckling period alone (C-S) had a
lower relative total fat and total visceral fat mass, and
reduced relative gonadal and omental fat mass at 12 weeks
of age compared to C-C offspring (Table 2).
Glucose tolerance. No effects of prenatal and/or post-
natal sucrose exposure were observed for glucose tolerance
AUC in offspring at either 3 weeks (Table 3) or 12 weeks
(Table 4). There were also no significant effects on
individual blood glucose values at any time points during
the glucose tolerance test (data not shown).
Plasma glucose, hormone and lipid concentrations. At
3 weeks, plasma glucose concentrations were significantly
lower in both male and female S-S offspring compared
to C-C offspring (Table 3). Plasma insulin tended to
be increased in S-S females (P = 0.079) and S-C males
(P = 0.06). There was a trend toward elevated plasma
leptin concentrations in offspring exposed to sucrose only
during suckling (C-S) in both males (P = 0.091) and
females (P = 0.056). The HDL cholesterol concentration
and the ratio of HDL/LDL cholesterol were increased in
S-CoffspringcomparedtoC-Soffspringinbothmalesand
females. Plasma TG was higher in 3-week-old C-S males

compared to S-S and S-C, but not C-C, males (Table 3).
There were no significant differences in plasma FFA
concentrations between treatmentgroups at3weeks ofage
(males,P=0.164;females,P=0.368;Fig.2A).At12weeks,
however, plasma FFAs were significantly increased in male
S-C offspring compared to C-C offspring (P = 0.036),
with a trend toward the same effect in females (P = 0.088;
Fig. 2B). There were no other effects of perinatal sucrose
exposure on plasma hormones, glucose or lipids at either
3 weeks (Table 3) or 12 weeks (Table 4) of age.
Hepatic lipid content and fatty acid composition. There
were no overall effects of exposure to sucrose during either
the prenatal and/or the suckling periods on total hepatic
fat content (males, P = 0.371; females, P = 0.141; Fig. 3A)
or hepatic TG, FFA or phospholipid concentrations at
3 weeks of age (Table 5). At 12 weeks, a significant
effect of treatment was detected for total liver fat content
in female offspring (P = 0.032), and for phospholipid
concentration in male offspring (P = 0.036; Table 6), but
the Bonferroni post hoc adjustment failed to identify any
significant differences between treatment groups.
Hepatic fatty acid composition was significantly altered
by perinatal sucrose exposure in both male and female
offspring at 3 weeks. Hepatic total MUFA content was
increased in female S-S offspring compared to C-C
offspring (Table 5). In terms of individual MUFAs,
hepatic n-7 MUFA content was higher in both male and
female S-S offspring compared to C-C offspring, and
n-7 MUFA was also higher in C-S females compared
to C-C females (males, P = 0.012; females, P = 0.001;
Fig. 3B). In females, S-S offspring also had increased
total hepatic n-9 MUFA concentrations compared to C-C
offspring (P = 0.033; Fig. 3C), but this effect was not
present in males. Hepatic total n-3 PUFA content was
higher in S-C females compared to the C-C and C-S
groups, and was also higher in S-C compared to C-S
offspring in males (Table 5). There were no effects of
maternal sucrose consumption on hepatic SFA or n-6
PUFA content in either male or female offspring at
3 weeks (Table 5). There were no significant differences
between groups for the content of any individual fatty
acids at 12 weeks of age in either male or female offspring
(Table 6).

Perinatal exposure to sucrose or HFCS-55

Effects of perinatal HFCS-55 exposure
Body weight and growth. There were no effects of
HFCS-55 exposure during the prenatal and/or suckling
periods on offspring body weight at any time point
between birth and 12 weeks of age, nose–tail length or
abdominal circumference (data not shown), or on body
weight at post-mortem at 3 weeks (Table 1) or 12 weeks
(Table 2) of age.
Organ weights. While there were no effects of HFCS-55
exposure on relative organ weights at 3 weeks (Table 1),
at 12 weeks of age female H-H offspring had a higher
relative liver weight when compared to both C-C and C-H
offspring, an effect not observed in males (Table 2). There
were no effects of HFCS-55 exposure during either the
prenatal or the suckling periods on relative heart, adrenal,
kidney or pancreas weights in 12-week-old offspring,
independent of sex (Table 2).
Body fat mass. Exposure to HFCS-55 during the suckling
period alone was associated with increased relative
omental fat mass in both male and female offspring at
3 weeks of age compared to C-C offspring (Table 1). In
males, total relative fat mass and relative subcutaneous fat
mass were also both higher in C-H compared to H-C
offspring, but not compared to C-C offspring, with a
trend toward increased relative visceral fat mass in male
offspring exposed to HFCS-55 during suckling, regardless
of prenatal exposure (P = 0.056). At 12 weeks of age,
however, males exposed to HFCS-55 during both the pre-
natal and the suckling periods (H-H) had a lower relative
retroperitoneal fat mass and also tended (P = 0.063) to
have a lower relative total visceral fat mass compared
to C-C offspring (Table 2). No other effects of perinatal
HFCS-55 exposure on relative fat mass were observed in
offspring at 3 or 12 weeks.
Glucose tolerance. There was no effect of HFCS-55
exposure on glucose tolerance AUC at either 3 weeks
(Table 3) or 12 weeks (Table 4). There were also no effects
on any individual blood glucose values during the glucose
tolerance test for offspring at 3 or 12 weeks of age (data
not shown).
Plasma glucose, hormone and lipid concentrations. At
3 weeks of age, plasma FFA concentrations were higher
in offspring exposed to HFCS-55 only during the prenatal
period (H-C) compared to C-C offspring in both males
andfemales(males,P=0.008;females,P=0.013;Fig.2C).
This same elevation of plasma FFAs in the H-C compared
to the C-C group was also observed at 12 weeks of age
in both males and females (males, P = 0.006; females,

Discussion
Despite fructose-containing sweeteners being associated
with detrimental health impacts in adults, the effect
of maternal consumption of SSBs on the developing
offspring is relatively unknown. We previously reported
that maternal sucrose and HFCS-55 consumption were
both associated with increased energy intake in dams,
but that the metabolic impact of these sugars differed,
with sucrose-fed dams exhibiting increased adiposity
and dyslipidaemia, while those that consumed HFCS-55
tended to develop hyperinsulinaemia (Toop et al. 2015).
In this previous study, maternal HFCS-55 also resulted in
lower plasma FFA concentrations in both the dam and
their newborn offspring (Toop et al. 2015). The current
study builds on these previous findings by following up the
offspringexposedperinatallytoeithersucroseorHFCS-55
at 3 and 12 weeks of age. We have identified several effects,
particularly in relation to body fat mass, plasma FFAs
and hepatic lipid composition, and have shown that these
are dependent on both the specific sugar involved and
the timing of the exposure (i.e. prenatally or during the
suckling period).
Neither
developmental
exposure

sucrose
nor
HFCS-55 had any significant impact on offspring body
weight at 3 or 12 weeks of age. Therefore, maternal sugar
consumption did not appear to either impair or accelerate
the postnatal growth trajectory of the offspring before
or after weaning. This is consistent with the findings
reported by Kendig et al. (2015), who also reported no
impact of maternal consumption of a 10% (w/v) sucrose
beverageduringpregnancyonthebodyweightofweanling
offspring. Other studies that have investigated the effects
of maternal sucrose consumption during pregnancy and
lactation (D’Alessandro et al. 2012, 2014; Samuelsson et al.
2013), or sucrose or HFCS consumption during either the
pregnancy or lactation periods (Bocarsly et al. 2012), have
generally reported increased body weight of offspring,
dependent on both sex and age. The discrepancies between
studies may be explained by differences in maternal sugar
consumption, exposure window and the age at which
offspring were evaluated.
The major findings of the current study relate to the
significant impact of perinatal sucrose and HFCS-55
exposure on offspring fat mass and hepatic lipid profile.
Thepostnatalwindowisthemajorperiodinwhichrodents
deposit white adipose tissue (Taylor & Poston, 2007), and
consistent with other cross-fostering models investigating
the effect of exposure to maternal obesity (Gorski et al.
2006) or consumption of a high-fat (Sun et al. 2012)
or cafeteria (Gugusheff et al. 2013) diet during different
developmental windows, exposure to either sucrose or
HFCS-55 during the suckling period was found to have a
greater impact on adipose tissue deposition than exposure
before birth. Thus, exposure to either sucrose or HFCS-55
during the suckling period alone, but not during the pre-
natal period, was associated with increased visceral fat
deposition in the 3-week-old offspring. This suggests that
offspring consumed increased energy during this period,
potentially from increased fat and/or energy content of
the maternal milk. While these parameters were not
measured in the current study, Chicco et al. (2016)
reported that maternal consumption of a high-sucrose
diet was associated with increased saturated fat content of
the milk. The increased fat mass observed in 3-week-old

offspring appeared to be mainly driven by deposition in
the omental depot. This is significant, as excess visceral
fat accumulation is known to be more detrimental to
metabolic health than excess fat storage in subcutaneous
fat depots (Kershaw & Flier, 2004). Interestingly, visceral
adiposity was not significantly increased in offspring
exposed to either sugar during both the prenatal and
suckling periods. This raises the interesting possibility
that prenatal exposure to sugar produces physiological
adaptations which ‘prepare’ the individual for a post-
natal high-sugar environment (i.e. a ‘predictive–adaptive’
response), where exposure to either sugar during the
suckling period promoted fat deposition only in the
absence of exposure earlier in development.
In contrast to reports in humans of increased childhood
adiposity being associated with increased fat mass later
in life (Biro & Wien, 2010), we found that the elevated
fat mass observed at 3 weeks was either normalised,
or in some cases actually reduced in comparison to
controls, by 12 weeks (young adulthood). Importantly,
this occurred despite all offspring having been fed the
same diet (standard rodent chow) from weaning. Most
notably, 12-week-old male offspring exposed to sucrose
during the suckling period alone had a lower total
relative fat mass and total visceral fat mass (driven by
decreased relative omental and gonadal fat mass), while
offspring exposed to HFCS-55 during the prenatal and
suckling periods had a lower retroperitoneal fat mass.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report
that developmental exposure to sucrose or HFCS-55 is
associated with reduced fat mass in young adult offspring
following weaning onto a control diet, as other studies
have reported either increased adiposity (Samuelsson et al.
2013) or no change compared to controls (D’Alessandro
et al. 2012, 2014). While the mechanism underlying
the reduced adiposity remains unknown, it may involve
altered adipocyte programming, previously reported in
fructose-exposed offspring (Alzamendi et al. 2010), in
particular an upregulation of lipolysis in fat depots and
associated increased mobilisation of TGs from adipose
stores.
This is supported by our finding of long-term elevated
plasma FFAs in offspring exposed to either sucrose or
HFCS-55, particularly those exposed to sugar during the
prenatal period only. FFAs are usually released from the
adipose tissue via TG lipolysis when energy levels are low,
but this can also occur as a result of aberrant regulation
of adipose tissue lipolysis, such that there is a failure to
suppress lipolysis when energy stores increase (Capurso &
Capurso, 2012). At 3 and 12 weeks, the prenatally exposed
offspring were no longer directly exposed to sucrose or
HFCS-55, with offspring consuming the same diet as
controls, suggesting that the persistence of higher plasma
FFAs at the latter time point is likely to be a consequence
of altered adipose tissue programming. While the precise
mechanismresponsiblefortheelevatedplasmaFFAsinthe
current study remains unclear, it is well established that
chronic elevations of circulating FFAs can promote ectopic
fatstorage,andisassociatedwithadversemetaboliceffects,
including the development and progression of insulin
resistance (Capurso & Capurso, 2012).
A major finding of the current study was that peri-
natal exposure to either sucrose or HFCS-55 resulted in
significant alterations in hepatic lipid composition, and in
HFCS-55offspring,hepaticfatcontent.Thisisparticularly
important in light of evidence that intra-hepatic fat
content is more strongly correlated with insulin resistance
than extra-hepatic visceral adiposity (Fabbrini et al. 2009),
and that the type of fatty acids which make up the
hepatic fat also has important metabolic implications
(Puri et al. 2007). In this study, 3-week-old male offspring
exposed to HFCS-55 during the suckling period alone
had an overall increase in liver fat content compared to
control offspring, with a similar trend observed in females.
The overall increase in hepatic fat content observed in
these offspring is likely to result from increased hepatic
de novo lipogenesis, potentially due, at least in part,
to an increased availability of circulating FFAs for lipid
synthesis.
In addition to affecting total hepatic fat content, we also
identified a number of significant effects of perinatal sugar
exposure on hepatic lipid composition in the 3-week-old
offspring. Furthermore, it appeared that consumption of
a control chow diet from weaning until 12 weeks of age
was sufficient to ameliorate the majority of changes in
hepatic lipid content and composition. While both sucrose
and HFCS-55 exposure appeared to impact hepatic lipid
composition at 3 weeks, particularly MUFA content, the
critical window of exposure differed, with the majority of
effects observed in response to HFCS-55 exposure during
the suckling period alone, but sucrose exposure across
both the prenatal and the suckling periods. Independent
of treatment group, the effects of sugar exposure on liver
fatty acid composition were generally more pronounced in
female offspring, which may not be surprising given pre-
vious evidence that adult female rats are more susceptible
to hepatic effects resulting from fructose consumption
(Vil`
a et al. 2011).
The major changes observed in hepatic fatty acid
composition were in relation to n-7, n-9 and total MUFA
content, and n-3 PUFA content, and differed according
to the sugar and window of exposure. Sucrose exposure
during both the prenatal and suckling periods increased
the hepatic n-7 and n-9 MUFA and total MUFA content
at 3 weeks of age, and this effect was more pronounced
in female offspring, with a smaller increase in n-7 MUFAs
in females exposed only during the suckling period. The
critical window differed for HFCS-55 exposure, such that
while female offspring exposed during both the pre-
natal and suckling periods had increased hepatic n-7

increased totalMUFAs,in addition ton-7and n-9MUFAs,

and oleic acid (18:1, n-9), the two key n-7 and n-9 MUFAs,

desaturase (SCD; also known as delta-9 desaturase),
an enzyme associated with the development of hepatic
steatosis and obesity (Ntambi et al. 2002; Miyazaki et al.
2004).Therefore,onepossibleexplanationisthatperinatal
exposure to sucrose or HFCS-55 resulted in programmed
changes in the expression and/or regulation of the SCD-1
gene, increasing SCD-1 activity, and consequently, n-7
and n-9 MUFA synthesis. In support of this, SCD-1
expression has previously been shown to be increased in
the liver of 3-week-old offspring of dams fed a high-fat
and high-sucrose diet during pregnancy (Wanjihia et al.
2013) and in 6-month-old offspring exposed to a high-fat
diet during both the fetal and suckling periods (Seet et al.
2015).
The offspring exposed to sucrose and HFCS-55 were
not directly compared in the current study, and although
many of the effects were similar, it appeared that the
critical exposure period for hepatic lipid content and
concentration in 3-week-old offspring differed between
these sugars. The least metabolically favourable profile was
observed in offspring exposed to sucrose during both the
prenatal and suckling periods, but in offspring exposed
to HFCS-55 during suckling only. We believe that this
difference may indicate a predictive–adaptive response in
offspring exposed to HFCS-55, such that exposure before
birth induced physiological adaptations which conferred
protection against the effects of subsequent exposure to
HFCS-55 in the postnatal period. This did not appear
to occur in those exposed to sucrose. The underlying
biological mechanisms remain to be determined, but may
relate to different effects of the sugars on the expression of
hepaticgenesassociatedwithfructoseorlipidmetabolism.
Another possibility is that consumption of sucrose and
HFCS-55 by dams during lactation had different effects
on milk composition, which could potentially account for
the differential effects of exposure to HFCS-55 and sucrose
during the suckling period. It was recently reported that
fructose is detectable in the breast milk of women, and
the fructose concentration was positively associated with
infant body weight and fat mass (Goran et al. 2017).
Furthermore, Vickers et al. (2011) detected fructose in
the stomach contents (a proxy for milk) of 10-day-old
rat offspring from both control and fructose-fed dams,
with increased plasma fructose levels observed in offspring
from fructose-fed dams only. It is therefore plausible that
high maternal fructose consumption, as in our study, may
result in elevated fructose in rodent milk. There may have
also been a difference in the concentrations of specific
milk lipids, as previously reported by Chicco et al. (2016)
for dams fed a high-sucrose diet during lactation, or
differences in other milk components. This needs to be
investigated in future studies.
Perinatal sugar exposure was also associated with
altered hepatic concentrations of n-3 PUFAs, such that
3-week-old female offspring exposed to sucrose before
birth had a higher hepatic n-3 PUFA content compared
to controls and those exposed during suckling only. This
was unexpected, as n-3 PUFAs are essential fatty acids
that must be obtained from the diet (Mennitti et al.
2015), and intake of chow (the only source of n-3 PUFAs)
was reduced in sucrose-fed dams (Toop et al. 2015).
Placental fatty acid transfer is dependent on maternal
plasma fatty acid concentrations, and there do not appear
to be any mechanisms that compensate for low levels
of maternally derived long-chain PUFAs in the offspring
(Innis, 2008). It is possible that this increase in hepatic n-3
PUFA content could represent a compensatory response
to the relative deficit of n-3 PUFAs in the maternal
diet, where the offspring of sucrose-fed dams may have
accumulated more n-3 PUFAs during suckling, after being
cross-fostered to a control dam, an effect which persisted
at 3 weeks of age. Studies have highlighted the importance
of hepatic n-3 in metabolic regulation, and high levels of
n-3 PUFAs in the liver, resulting from maternal feeding of
an n-3 PUFA-enriched diet, have been associated with a
favourable hepatic fatty acid profile in 3-day-old offspring,
with increased fatty acid oxidation and reduced SCD-1
expression (Novak et al. 2012).
The plasma cholesterol profile of offspring appeared
to be altered by HFCS-55 exposure, where 3-week-old
offspring exposed during suckling had decreased HDL
cholesterol and a decreased HDL/LDL ratio, suggestive
of a more detrimental blood lipid profile in terms of
cardiovascular disease risk and atherosclerosis (Assmann
& Gotto, 2004; Grundy et al. 2014), which had disappeared
by 12 weeks. Unexpectedly, 12-week-old male and female
offspring prenatally exposed to HFCS-55 had a higher
HDL/LDL ratio than control offspring, suggestive of a
more favourable lipid profile. However, the lipid profile of
rodents differs from that of humans (Badimon et al. 2013),
so care must be taken when interpreting these findings,
particularly as there were no significant changes in plasma
triglycerides in offspring.
While there were no effects of exposure to sucrose or
HFCS-55 on glucose tolerance, potential subtle alterations
in glucose-insulin metabolism are suggested by the lower
plasma glucose concentrations observed in 3-week-old
male and female offspring exposed to sucrose during
the prenatal and suckling periods. In males, we observed
an interesting reduction in relative pancreas weight at
12 weeks of age in offspring exposed to sucrose during
either the suckling period alone, or both developmental
windows. This is similar to previous findings by Srinivasan
et al. (2003), who reported that postnatal consumption

associated with the development of hyperinsulinaemia,
which persisted into adult life. While we acknowledge
that organ weight is a crude measure of structure or
function, our findings nevertheless suggest that pancreatic
growth may be particularly sensitive to postnatal sucrose
exposure, and this warrants further investigation. Another
interesting observation was the decreased relative heart
weight observed in 12-week-old female offspring exposed
to sucrose during either the prenatal or the suckling peri-
ods only, a result that is not consistent with the increased
heart weight and elevated blood pressure reported by
Samuelsson et al. (2013) for females exposed to sucrose
during both the prenatal and the suckling periods.
Blood pressure was not measured in the current study,
so it is unknown whether the smaller heart affected
cardiovascular function. Importantly, the reduced relative
pancreas and heart weights were not apparent until
12 weeks, which suggest that the full extent of the insult
may not become apparent until early adulthood when
organ maturation is complete.
While many studies have used rodents for the
investigation
of
altered
maternal
nutrition
during
development, the significant differences in developmental
timing between humans and rodents must be considered.
Rat offspring are relatively under-developed at birth when
compared to humans, and it has been suggested that a
rat at postnatal day 12 is approximately equal to a human
newborn (Sengupta, 2013). Therefore, the prenatal inter-
vention in this model is more comparable to early to
mid-gestation in human development, and the postnatal
intervention would be more comparable to late gestation
to early postnatal development in humans. Furthermore,
it is important to note that the process of cross-fostering,
in the absence of any other insult, has been shown
to affect the cardiovascular and metabolic phenotype
of offspring, including increased appetite, body weight,
adiposity and hyperinsulinaemia, in addition to increased
blood pressure, compared to offspring that remained
with their biological mother (Matthews et al. 2011). All
offspring in the current study were cross-fostered to
reduce any potential confounding effects, but it cannot
be excluded that any metabolic effects associated with
the cross-fostering procedure may have varied between
offspring of different treatment groups.
Conclusions
In this study we report that perinatal exposure to maternal
consumption of sucrose or HFCS-55 appears to have
some detrimental effects on the offspring, particularly
on adiposity, plasma FFAs and hepatic lipid composition,
which differed depending on the sugar and the window
of exposure. One of the most interesting findings was
the difference between critical windows of exposure for
the respective sugars in relation to effects on hepatic
lipid composition. Exposure to sucrose during both peri-
ods, but exposure to HFCS-55 during sucking only, was
associated with a less metabolically favourable hepatic
fatty acid profile in 3-week-old offspring. Furthermore,
the short-term effects (3 weeks) resulting from exposure
to a maternal diet high in sucrose or HFCS-55 appear to
be mostly ameliorated by consumption of a nutritionally
balanced diet after weaning. However, these offspring
may be at greater risk of a metabolic ‘second-hit’,
where exposure to an additional insult during adult
life (nutritional or physiological) may strain the already
predisposed organ systems, thereby exacerbating any
outcomes compared to control offspring (Vickers, 2014),
similar to that previously observed by D’Alessandro et al.
(2012, 2014) for sucrose exposure.
Maternal consumption of fructose-containing sugars
appears to negatively affect long-term programming of
offspring in a rodent model, and further research is
required to better understand these programmed changes
and their potential implications on the capacity of the
offspring to adapt to a secondary metabolic challenge
in postnatal life. Importantly, our results indicate that
exposure to sucrose and HFCS-55 through the mothers
diet, i.e. without direct consumption, is sufficient to
produce negative impacts on metabolic health in the
offspring. While we acknowledge the limitations of trans-
lating this research to humans, the results presented
here suggest that limiting maternal consumption of
added sugars may improve the short- and long-term
metabolic health of the offspring. This is particularly
important as there are currently no specific nutritional
guidelines regarding the consumption of added sugars
by pregnant women. The results from this study also
highlight the importance of maternal nutrition during the
lactation period, which appears to be equally important as
nutrition during pregnancy, and suggest that this should
be considered in guidelines for maternal SSB or added
sugar consumption.
