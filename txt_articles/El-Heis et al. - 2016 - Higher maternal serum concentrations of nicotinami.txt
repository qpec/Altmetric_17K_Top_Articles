Abstract
Background—Evidence that atopic eczema partly originates in utero is increasing, with some 
studies linking the risk of developing the condition with aspects of maternal diet during pregnancy. 
Nicotinamide, a naturally occurring nutrient that is maintained through the dietary intakes of 
vitamin B3 and tryptophan has been used in the treatment of some skin conditions including atopic 
eczema.
Objective—To examine the relation of maternal serum concentrations of nicotinamide and 
related tryptophan metabolites to the risk of atopic eczema in the offspring.
Methods—Within the UK Southampton Women Survey, infantile atopic eczema at ages 6 and 12 
months was ascertained (modified UK Working Party Criteria for the Definition of Atopic 
Dermatitis). Maternal serum levels of kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, tryptophan, 
nicotinamide and N1-methylnicotinamide were measured in late pregnancy by mass spectrometry, 
n=497 and related to the odds ratio of infantile atopic eczema.
Results—Maternal nicotinamide and related metabolite concentrations were not associated with 
offspring atopic eczema at age 6 months. Higher concentrations of nicotinamide and anthranilic 
acid were, however, associated with a lower risk of eczema at age 12 months (odds ratios 0.69,

Introduction
Atopic eczema is a highly prevalent and complex condition and evidence that it partly 
originates in utero is increasing. The risk of developing atopic eczema has been linked with 
a variety of environmental factors in pregnancy, including mother’s age, education and 
smoking, and some studies have proposed links with aspects of maternal diet during 
pregnancy. [1]
Nicotinamide is the amide form of niacin, also known as vitamin B3, an essential vitamin. 
Both compounds are precursors of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) in vivo. Nicotinamide is maintained 
by the intake of vitamin B3, found in foods including fish, meat, chicken, mushrooms, nuts 
and coffee, and by the intake of tryptophan, an essential amino acid that is a constituent of 
most proteins and is the precursor for serotonin and melatonin. In the liver, tryptophan can 
be converted to niacin via the kynurenine pathway, with quinolone acids as key 
intermediates.
The kynurenine pathway (Figure 1) is the major route for tryptophan metabolism in 
mammals, and is reported to regulate several fundamental biological processes, including 
cell death. Activation of the tryptophan catabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, 
induced by inflammatory stimuli (most importantly interferon-γ), leads to the formation of 
kynurenine and other metabolites that counter-regulate immune activation; in chronic 
immune activation continued immunosuppressive feedback mechanisms lead to elevated 
kynurenine concentrations. Kynurenine has been reported to enhance IgE-mediated 
responses. [2] Tryptophan is metabolised through kynureninase and kynurenine 
transaminase. Kynureninase converts kynurenine to anthranilic acid (AA) and 3-
hydroxykynurenine (HK) to 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA). Kynurenine transaminase 
converts the same two substrates into kynurenic acid (KA) and xanthurenic acid (XA), 
respectively. 3HAA is further converted to acroleyl aminofumarate, which in turn is 
converted to quinolinic acid (QA) through non enzymatic cyclization before conversion to 
nicotinic acid (niacin), the precursor for NAD. 3HAA and QA can alter Th1 cells [3], thus 
tending to increase Th2 reactivity. N1-Methylnicotinamide is a metabolite of nicotinamide; 
produced primarily in the liver, it has anti-inflammatory properties and may also influence 
thrombosis through activation of prostacyclin activation. [4]

 In a randomised control trial, topical 2% nicotinamide applied twice a day to atopic eczema 
for 4 and 8 weeks significantly reduced water loss and increased stratum corneum hydration 
when compared with white petrolatum. [5] Orally, nicotinamide has been shown to reduce 
transepidermal water loss. [6] It is not fully understood how oral nicotinamide 
administration may alter cellular inflammation in vivo; in a limited group of healthy human 
participants exposed to experimental endotoxaemia it had little effect on cytokines or 
exhaled nitric oxide. [7]
The above observations led us to examine the hypothesis that higher maternal serum 
concentrations of nicotinamide and related tryptophan metabolites in late pregnancy may be 
associated with a decreased risk of atopic eczema in the offspring.
Methods
Within the UK Southampton Women’s Survey (SWS), a mother-offspring study, information 
on maternal diet, lifestyle and socioeconomic status was collected. [8] Women were 
followed up through their pregnancies, 3008 delivered a live born infant with no major 
congenital growth abnormalities and were assessed for atopic eczema at 6 or 12 months. Of 
these, 497 had an aliquot available for measurement of serum tryptophan, kynurenine, 
kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, nicotinamide and N1-Methylnicotinamide concentrations in 
late pregnancy. Fragmentation confirmed the identity of the analytes. Measurements were 
made by (BEVITAL AS, Norway) using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass 
spectrometry [9]; coefficients of variation were <12%.
Case definition of atopic eczema was based on the UK Working Party diagnostic criteria for 
the definition of atopic eczema [10], assessed by trained research nurses who undertook a 
standardised questionnaire and examination. A personal history of atopy was omitted as a 
criterion given the young age of the infants, who were not old enough to have developed 
clearly defined asthma or hay fever.
Metabolite concentrations were transformed using Fisher-Yates transformation [11] to allow 
analysis of relations per standard deviation (SD) change in concentration. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed (Stata version 13.0, Statacorp LP, 
TX) to relate maternal demographic and lifestyle characteristics, maternal serum metabolite 
levels and early life factors to infant eczema at ages 6 and 12 months. Maternal factors that 
were considered as potential confounders were: age at child’s birth, pre-pregnancy BMI, 
education, smoking, parity and maternal history of eczema in creases of elbows or knees in 
the last 12 months (at 6 months); potential infant confounders were: sex, gestational age, 
birth weight, breastfeeding duration and filaggrin single-nucleotide polymorphism 
rs7512552 (identified as related to atopic eczema in the SWS cohort as part of the 
replication studies following a recent multi-ancestry genome-wide association study [12], 
and available for 414 infants in this subsample).
All phases of the Southampton Women’s Survey were approved by the Southampton and 
South West Hampshire Local Research Ethics Committee and parents gave written informed 
consent.

 Results
Maternal and infant characteristics are summarised in Table 1. Among the 497 participants, 
the mother’s average age at child’s birth was 31.2 years (Standard Deviation (SD) = 3.5); 
48.9% were primiparous and 12.5% smoked during pregnancy. 50.7% of infants were male; 
mean birthweight of infants was 3.51 kg (SD 0.47) and gestational age 40.1 weeks (IQR 
39.1 – 41.0). 30.6% of the infants had the rs 7512552 SNP. 10.7% and 13.7% had atopic 
eczema at ages 6 and 12 months, respectively.
Supplementary Table 1 shows that the characteristics of the 497 participants in the study 
group with maternal metabolite measurements in late pregnancy were similar to the overall 
SWS cohort. However, the study group mothers were older at child’s birth, smoking was less 
prevalent and infants’ birthweight was higher.
Table 2 shows univariate analyses of maternal and infant characteristics in relation to infant 
atopic eczema at age 6 months. Girls had a lower odds ratio of atopic eczema at age 6 
months (p=0.002). None of the maternal serum metabolite concentrations were associated 
with offspring atopic eczema at age 6 months. However, univariate analyses of maternal and 
infant characteristics showed that higher maternal serum concentrations of nicotinamide and 
anthranilic acid were associated with lower odds ratios of atopic eczema at age 12 months 
(Table 3; nicotinamide OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.53-0.90 per SD change, p=0.007, Figure 2a; 
anthranilic acid OR 0.63, 95%CI 0.48-0.83 per SD change, p=0.001, Figure 2b). No 
significant associations were found with late pregnancy serum levels of tryptophan, 
kynurenine, kynurenic acid or N1-methylnicotinamide. Higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI 
(p=0.001) and male sex (p=0.009) were also associated with higher odds ratios of atopic 
eczema at age 12 months.
As concentrations of nicotinamide and anthranilic acid showed a significant correlation 
(r=0.218,p<0.001), we undertook separate multivariate analyses of each metabolite in 
relation to atopic eczema, taking account of maternal characteristics and other potential 
confounding variables (Table 4). Taking account of these other variables, higher maternal 
serum nicotinamide (p=0.013) and anthranilic acid (p=0.003) concentrations remained 
significantly associated with lower risks of atopic eczema at age 12 months. The odds ratios 
and P values changed little after additionally taking account of rs 7512552 SNP, available for 
a subsample of the group (data not shown).
Discussion
Our results show that maternal nicotinamide and related tryptophan metabolite 
concentrations were not associated with offspring atopic eczema at 6 months. However, 
higher late pregnancy maternal concentrations of nicotinamide and anthranilic acid were 
associated with a lower prevalence of eczema at age 12 months. These associations were 
resistant to adjustment for potential confounding variables.
Nicotinamide is the precursor of NAD and is the sole substrate and an inhibitor of the 
nuclear enzyme poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1). [13] Through these functions, 
nicotinamide can enhance energy-dependent cellular processes such as DNA repair [14], and

 maintain genomic stability and regulation of some transcription factors, particularly in 
relation to the expression of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and 
inflammatory mediators. [15] Nicotinamide inhibits cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
phosphodiesterase (cAMP PDE) and stabilises mast cells and leukocytes through inhibition 
of histamine and immunoglobulin E release. [16] It has also been shown to increase the 
biosynthesis of ceramide and other stratum corneum lipids [17] and prevents the 
upregulation of aquaporin, thereby decreasing water permeability and water loss. [18] 
Nicotinamide can improve the overall structure, moisture, and elasticity of skin as it 
increases the synthesis of collagen and proteins that play an important role in the formation 
of keratin, filaggrin, and involucrin. [19] Through these functions, nicotinamide has the 
potential to alter the disease processes associated with atopic eczema.
There is only limited evidence of an effect of dietary factors on serum tryptophan metabolite 
concentrations. Dietary niacin is readily converted to nicotinamide in the body and challenge 
studies have shown a robust rise in anthranilic acid concentrations after administration of 
sodium benzoate, a widely used preservative found in many foods and soft drinks. [20] 
These observations suggest that influences other than intakes of niacin and tryptophan may 
underlie the associations we found.
As can be inferred from Figure 1, lower levels of anthranilic acid and nicotinamide do not 
point to a specific enzymatic block in the tryptophan pathway either genetically or 
environmentally induced, and lower levels of these two metabolites may be a general 
reflection of perturbation of the pathway or low substrate availability. Additionally, our 
findings (Figure 2) show a graded association between lower maternal nicotinamide and 
anthranilic acid levels and the offspring’s risk of atopic eczema, pointing away from a 
simple genetically determined enzymatic block. However, the pathway has not been 
intensively investigated and we hope our data will stimulate more intensive investigation 
including analysis of genetic polymorphisms.
Although total tryptophan is decrease in the third trimester of pregnancy [21], free 
tryptophan is increased due to decreased binding to albumin, as albumin decreases and non-
esterified fatty acids increase in late pregnancy. [22] Nicotinamide is able to cross the human 
placenta, and fetal blood levels of nicotinamide are greater than corresponding maternal 
blood levels. [23] There are no reports of adverse effects due to nicotinamide in human 
fetuses, but the effect of high doses is unknown. [23] There is no human data on maternal 
use of B vitamins and tryptophan in relation to offspring atopic eczema, however, animal 
studies on long-term high dose nicotinamide supplementation in pregnancy, have been 
associated with nicotinamide-induced oxidative tissue injury, insulin resistance and 
disturbed methyl metabolism that can lead to epigenetic changes. [24]
Our study highlights a link between lower maternal nicotinamide levels and related 
tryptophan metabolites and an increased risk of atopic eczema in the offspring. Strengths of 
the study are its prospective nature, the standardised assessment of eczema by trained staff 
and control for confounding factors. Limitations of our study were the relatively small 
sample size of 497 and the lack of measurements of metabolite levels in early pregnancy. 
Replicating the findings in other populations would be a valuable next step. Modified UK

 Working Party Diagnostic Criteria for Atopic Dermatitis were used, in which we omitted 
atopic disease in a first degree relative as we are seeking to disentangle the apparent 
heterogeneous phenotypes that ‘atopic eczema’ is now thought to represent; excluding those 
with no family history of atopy would remove an important group of infants from such 
studies. This modification has, however, not previously been validated. Maternal late 
pregnancy concentrations of nicotinamide and anthranilic acid were associated with infant 
eczema at age 12 months but not at age 6 months; this could also reflect heterogeneity in the 
etiology and pathogenesis of atopic eczema in early childhood. [25] Although the 
association was independent of filaggrin status, no information was available on methylation 
quantitative trait loci that may also influence tryptophan metabolism.
In summary, our study is the first to link maternal serum levels of nicotinamide and related 
metabolites to the risk of atopic eczema in the offspring. The findings point to potentially 
modifiable maternal influences on this complex, multifactorial condition and support the 
evidence that atopic eczema partly originates in utero.
