SUMMARY
To maintain a symbiotic relationship between the
host and its resident intestinal microbiota, appro-
priate mucosal T cell responses to commensal
antigens must be established. Mice acquire both
IgG and IgA maternally; the former has primarily
been implicated in passive immunity to pathogens
while the latter mediates host-commensal mutu-
alism. Here, we report the surprising observation
that mice generate T cell-independent and largely
Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent IgG2b and IgG3
antibody responses against their gut microbiota.
We demonstrate that maternal acquisition of these
antibodies dampens mucosal T follicular helper re-
sponses and subsequent germinal center B cell
responses following birth. This work reveals a feed-
back loop whereby T cell-independent, TLR-depen-
dent antibodies limit mucosal adaptive immune
responses to newly acquired commensal antigens
and uncovers a broader function for maternal IgG.
INTRODUCTION
Establishing and maintaining a symbiotic relationship with the
gut microbiota is critical to the health of coelomic animals. Gut
commensal bacteria facilitate digestion, prevent infection, and
enhance immune function (Belkaid and Hand, 2014; Hooper
et al., 2012). The host employs many mechanisms to maintain
this beneficial relationship including production of antimicrobial
factors and immunosuppressive cytokines and selective differ-
entiation of specialized immune cells (Belkaid and Hand, 2014;
Hooper et al., 2012). Dysregulated immune responses resulting
from breakdowns in these homeostatic mechanisms underlie
the development of intestinal inflammation and can lead to
pathologies such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis
(Neurath, 2014).
The differentiation of CD4+ T helper (Th) cells within the
gut is carefully controlled such that T cells specific for many
commensal species are either biased toward a regulatory
T cell (Treg) fate or remain ignorant of their cognate antigens
(Hand
et
al.,
2012;
Lathrop
et
al.,
2011). Nevertheless,
commensal-specific T cell responses occur in several circum-
stances. Colonization with microbes that adhere to the intestinal
epithelium, such as segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB), is
sufficient to elicit effector Th17 cells (Atarashi et al., 2015; Ivanov
et al., 2009). Changes in the inflammatory environment, such as
infection with Toxoplasma gondii, can also promote Th1 cell
responses to commensal antigens (Hand et al., 2012). While
these examples demonstrate that commensal species can elicit
inflammatory T cells, such responses are not the norm. The
mechanisms that limit T cell activation to commensal antigens,
however, remain poorly understood.
Following birth, the virgin immune system must appropriately
respond to colonization of the gut by complex and dynamic
microbial species before many of the mechanisms that pro-
mote intestinal homeostasis throughout life are fully estab-
lished. Lactating mothers nourish neonatal mammals with
breast milk rich in factors that compensate for the immature in-
testinal immune system of their offspring. For example, acqui-
sition of TGF-b and IL-10 from breast milk functions to limit
bacterial translocation and promote tolerogenic responses to
the microbiota (Garofalo et al., 1995; Letterio et al., 1994).
Mothers also influence immunity in their offspring through the
provision of antibodies. Acquisition of maternal IgG antibodies
both in utero and via breast milk helps protect neonates against
pathogens (Niewiesk, 2014). Likewise, ingestion of IgA can
mediate passive immunity to enteric infections (Lamm, 1997)
and reinforce appropriate anti-commensal immune responses
in offspring (Macpherson et al., 2008). Thus, maternal anti-
bodies may educate the neonatal immune system on newly
acquired commensal species thereby facilitating appropriate
effector T cell (Teff) responses to the microbiota during early
life.
IgA is the dominant antibody isotype produced within the gut
and mouse mammary glands (Macpherson et al., 2008; Weisz-
Carrington et al., 1977). Dimeric IgA produced in the gut lamina
propria (LP) is transported to the lumen by the polymeric Ig
receptor where it limits microbial access to the intestinal epithe-
lium (Cerutti and Rescigno, 2008). IgA-secreting cells are gener-
ated in the presence or absence of T cell help. Activation of
innate immune receptors such as TLRs by microbial ligands pro-
motes T-independent (TI) IgA responses resulting in the produc-
tion of low affinity antibodies specific for a diverse array of

 commensal species (Fagarasan et al., 2010; Pabst, 2012). In
contrast, high affinity T-dependent IgA responses are elicited
by enteric pathogens and a subset of microbes with unique
properties, such as SFB (Bunker et al., 2015; Pabst, 2012). These
two pools of IgA aid in the broad recognition of microbes that
colonize the intestine and help preserve the intestinal barrier.
Based on analysis of antibody responses to a subset of
commensal species in healthy mice and observations that
mammals with defects in intestinal homeostasis develop IgG re-
sponses to commensal antigens, it has been proposed that the
commensal-specific antibody response is entirely restricted to
IgA (Harmsen et al., 2012; Macpherson et al., 2000; Slack
et al., 2009).
Here, we report that healthy mice generate a broad, T cell-in-
dependent IgG response to a diverse array of commensal
species. We identify breast milk as a primary source of anti-
commensal IgG antibodies early in life and demonstrate that
maternally acquired anti-commensal IgG helps dampen Th cell
driven immune responses to newly encountered microbes.
RESULTS
Identification of Anti-Commensal IgG2b and IgG3
Antibodies
To characterize the antibody response to the microbiota, we
developed a high-throughput flow cytometry assay we termed
mFLOW for ‘‘microbiota flow cytometry.’’ Using feces as a
source of microbiota, we stained bacteria with sera from the
same mouse. This assay varies from a method in which
IgA-bound microbes are isolated from intestinal contents
(Bunker et al., 2015; Palm et al., 2014; van der Waaij et al.,
1994); addition of sera to intestinal contents allows profiling of
the complete antibody response to the microbiota, rather than
restricting analysis to antibodies present in the intestinal lumen
already bound to commensals. We used the DNA dye SYBR
Green to preferentially stain microbes in the feces of colonized
(specific pathogen free; SPF) mice, but not fecal particulates in
germ-free (GF) animals, allowing us to gate definitively on
(SYBRhi) bacteria (Figure 1A) (Maurice et al., 2013). We then
used isotype-specific secondary antibodies to characterize the
anti-commensal antibody response. As expected, a fraction of
microbes stained positive for IgA and IgM (Figure 1B). Surpris-
ingly, IgG also bound a significant proportion of the microbiota
(Figure 1B). As in previous reports, we observed minimal binding
of microbes by IgG1 and IgG2c antibodies; instead, the majority
of anti-commensal IgG antibodies were of the IgG2b and IgG3
isotypes (Figure 1C) (Slack et al., 2009).
Although IgA-bound microbes were detected in the absence
of serum, we did not observe IgG-bound microbes, consistent
with a lack of transport of IgG antibodies across the intestinal
epithelium (Figure 1B) (Bunker et al., 2015; Palm et al., 2014).
Immunofluorescent staining of intestinal sections confirmed
these results (Figure S1A). We ruled out antigen-independent
binding of IgG antibodies by bacterial proteins that bind to the
IgG constant regions (Fc) by performing mFLOW with mono-
clonal IgG2b and IgG3 isotype antibodies that did not stain
commensal bacteria (Figure 1D). The presence of antibodies
was required for this response, as sera from B cell-deficient
mMT�/� mice did not result in detectable IgG2b+ or IgG3+ events
(Figures 1B-D).
To confirm that antibody-bound particles measured by
mFLOW were microbes, we showed that IgG2b and IgG3 anti-
bodies from the sera of healthy mice could stain pure cultures
of several bacteria strains isolated from feces of mice in our col-
ony. For example, we detected IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies
specific for Lactobacillus johnsonii and Parabacteroides dista-
sonis, but not Clostridium innocuum (Figure 1E). We did not
observe binding of IgG2b or IgG3 to pathogenic bacteria, such
as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Citrobacter
rodentium, or to a non-pathogenic Escherichia coli isolate
(Figure S1B). We generated several microbe-specific IgG3
hybridomas
from
wild-type
(WT)
mice
that
recapitulated
commensal-specific staining (Figure S1C). Finally, IgG from
sera of GF animals did not stain SYBRhi microbes from SPF
mice (Figure 1F), indicating that anti-commensal IgG antibodies
are not ‘‘natural’’ antibodies observed in mice housed under GF
conditions in the absence of microbiota (Bos et al., 1989).
Both the host genetic background and microbial variation in
SPF facilities can influence IgA responses to the microbiota
(Fransen et al., 2015; Moon et al., 2015). By mFLOW, we
observed similar anti-commensal IgG2b and IgG3 responses in
C57BL/6 mice housed at UC Berkeley, Jackson Labs, and Ta-
conic (Figure 1G). Additionally, anti-commensal IgG responses
were detectable in inbred and outbred mouse strains (Figure 1G).
These results demonstrate that generation of systemic anti-
commensal IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies is a general aspect of
immunity to the microbiota.
IgG Antibodies Recognize a Broad Spectrum of
Commensal Bacteria
We compared the overlap between bacteria bound by IgA,
IgG2b, and IgG3. The majority of IgA-bound microbes also
stained positive for IgG3 and IgG2b (Figures 2A and 2B). Addi-
tionally, IgG3 bound some commensals not bound by IgG2b or
IgA, indicating that IgG3 may expand the spectrum of microbes
recognized by the immune system. We next sorted populations
of antibody-bound bacteria and identified bacterial species by
16S rRNA-based profiling. As IgG3 bound all microbes bound
by IgG2b (Figures 2A and 2B), we confined our analysis to
IgG3+IgA�, IgG3+IgA+, IgG3-IgA� sorted groups and com-
pared these to input samples. After clustering and classifying
97% identity operational taxonomic units (OTUs; Supplemental
Experimental Procedures), we used Qiime 1.8.0 (Caporaso
et al., 2010) to perform principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) on
the unweighted UniFrac distances (Lozupone and Knight,
2005; Lozupone et al., 2011; Lozupone et al., 2007) among

Biosciences (Taconic). Graphs depict the frequencies of SYBR+ bacteria bound by the indicated antibody isotypes as measured by mFLOW.

 our samples. The antibody-bound microbial fractions (both
IgG3+IgA+ and IgG3+IgA�) clustered away from unbound
(IgG3�IgA�) and input populations with little overlap, indicating
that these fractions contain taxonomically divergent species of
microbes (Figure 2C). The sorted and input fractions are best
differentiated by principle component (PC) 1 and PC3, whereas
PC2 seems to account for variation among individual mice.
The microbial species diversity (Shannon diversity index) also
varied between the separate fractions, with an overall decrease
from the input to the selectively bound fractions (Figure S2A).
While there is little variation of microbial composition between
cohoused littermate animals, there can be considerable differ-
ences between mice housed in different enclosures (Figure S2B).
Regardless of the input microbiomes, sorting based on antibody
binding consistently segregated unbound bacteria away from
antibody-bound microbes (compare Figure 2C, sort B and Fig-
ure S2C, sort C). IgG3, and by correlation IgG2b, therefore
bind discrete groups of commensal bacteria regardless of differ-
ences in composition of bacteria colonizing the gut.
We examined the breadth of microbes bound by IgG3 anti-
bodies by comparing the relative abundance of bacterial genera
in the sorted fractions. IgG3 antibodies bound genera from all
bacterial orders present in the input samples, indicating that
these antibodies recognize a diverse spectrum of commensals
(Figure 2D). Further, IgG3 antibodies enhanced commensal
recognition beyond that of IgA as demonstrated by the enrich-
ment of genera in the Clostridiales and Desulfovibrionales orders
in the IgG3+IgA� fraction as compared to the IgG3+IgA+ frac-
tion. In a separate sorting experiment using mice colonized
with distinct microbiota (sort C, see Figure S2B) commensal
species bound by IgG3 changed, with OTUs belonging to the
order Bifidobacteriales and Lactobacillales being enriched in
the IgG3+IgA� fraction as compared to the IgG3+IgA+ fraction
(Figure S2D), emphasizing the dynamism of the anti-commensal
IgG response.
Characterization and Localization of IgG2b and IgG3
Antibody-Secreting Cells
We next characterized the B cells producing IgG3 and IgG2b an-
tibodies and found that, like IgA+ B cells, the frequencies and
numbers of IgG2b+ and IgG3+ B cells were elevated in the
mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) and Peyer’s patches (PP) relative

 to other lymphoid organs (Figure 3A, S3A). Additionally, IgG2b-
and IgG3-secreting cells could be detected at mucosal sites
such the mLN, PP and gut LP, albeit at lower frequencies than
IgA+ B cells (Figures 3B, 3SB). In comparison to IgDhi naive B
cells, IgG3+, IgG2b+ and IgA+ B cells expressed markers char-
acteristic of plasma cells, including decreased B220 levels and
high CD138 expression (Figure 3C). Further, these B cells ex-
pressed elevated levels of the B-1 cell associated marker CD43.
Generation of Anti-Commensal IgG Antibodies Is
T Cell-Independent and Largely TLR Dependent
Both IgG3 and IgG2b can be produced in the absence of T cell
help (Figure S3C) (Markowitz et al., 1993). To determine if pro-
duction of anti-commensal IgG2b and IgG3 required T cells we
performed mFLOW using samples from Tcrb�/� and Tcrb�/�
Tcrd�/� mice. The fraction of bacteria bound by IgG2b, IgG3,
and IgA was equivalent between T cell deficient and sufficient
mice indicating that T cells were not required for this response
(Figure 3D, S3D).
TI antibody responses fall into two groups based on antigen
type: TI-II antigens are generally polyvalent, repetitive structure,
whereas TI-I antigens have mitogenic properties and are often
ligands for TLRs. TLRs respond to a variety of microbe-derived
ligands including those expressed by the gut microbiota
and require MyD88 and TRIF to signal. Generation of anti-
commensal IgG2b and IgG3 was severely impaired in Myd88�/�
Trif�/� mice compared to co-housed controls (Figure 3E). Serum
IgG3 titers are reduced in Myd88�/�Trif�/� mice (Figure S3E)
(Pasare and Medzhitov, 2005); however, normalizing IgG3
titers to WT levels prior to incubation with commensals did
not restore anti-commensal IgG3 staining (Figure S3F), confirm-
ing that signaling through MyD88 and TRIF is required for pro-
duction of anti-commensal IgG3. Notably, we did not observe
defects in anti-commensal IgG responses in mice lacking
components of other innate immune pathways, including
Caspase1�/�Caspase11�/�, Nod1�/�Nod2�/� or Dectin1�/�
strains (Figure S3G).
Next, we focused on determining the contribution of particular
TLRs. The chaperone protein Unc93b1 is required for the func-
tion of TLRs 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13 (Lee et al., 2013; Tabeta
et al., 2006). Mice expressing a non-functional Unc93b1 allele
(Unc93b13d/3d) generated WT levels of anti-commensal IgG an-
tibodies (Figure S3H). In contrast, mice lacking both TLR2 and
TLR4 displayed a significant reduction in anti-commensal
IgG2b responses and a complete lack of anti-commensal IgG3
staining (Figure 3F). The fraction of microbiota bound by IgG3
was partially reduced when stained with sera from either Tlr2�/�
or Tlr4�/� animals, while anti-commensal IgG2b responses were
unaffected (Figure 3F). Thus, both TLR2 and TLR4, receptors for
bacterial lipopeptides and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respec-
tively, participate in the generation of anti-commensal IgG2b
and IgG3.
To determine the requirement for TLR signaling on B cells for
anti-commensal IgG responses, we reconstituted B cell deficient
mMT�/� pups with WT or Tlr2�/�Tlr4�/� B cells at day 1 post-
birth. At 10 weeks of age, we observed equivalent reconstitution
of WT and knockout cells in the blood, spleen, mLN and PP of
recipient mice (Figures 3G, S3I), yet mice that received Tlr2�/�
Tlr4�/� B cells exhibited diminished anti-commensal IgG2b
and IgG3 responses (Figure 3H). Importantly, we observed
normal anti-commensal IgM production and IgG3 responses
following immunization with the TI-II antigen NP-Ficoll, indicating
that Tlr2�/�Tlr4�/� B cells were functional (Figures S3J and S3K).
Thus, TLR2 and TLR4 signaling on B cells is required for optimal
generation of anti-commensal IgG antibodies, demonstrating
that, through TLRs, commensal-derived products drive the dif-
ferentiation of naive B cells into plasma cells that produce
IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies targeting gut microbial antigens.
Maternal Transmission of Microbiota-Specific IgG
Antibodies
We detected anti-commensal IgG2b and IgG3 responses in mice
as early as 2 weeks of age (Figure 4A). These responses waned
at 3 and 4 weeks of age and increased again in older mice. The
presence of these antibodies in young mice suggested that, like
IgA, they are maternally derived. Indeed, pups acquire maternal
IgG antibodies through breast milk as well as in utero via the
neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) (Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007). To
determine whether anti-commensal IgG antibodies are acquired
maternally, we first bred B cell-deficient mMT�/� dams with WT
sires to generate offspring that can generate functional anti-
commensal B cell responses, but lack maternally derived
antibodies. In contrast to offspring born to WT dams, anti-
commensal IgG2b and IgG3 responses were reduced at 2 and
3 weeks of age in pups born to mMT�/� dams (Figure 4B, top).
These results correlate with serum IgG2b and IgG3 titers in these
animals, and indicate that anti-commensal IgG responses are
mediated primarily by maternally derived antibodies at early
time points (Figure 4B, bottom). In addition to their presence in
the circulation, IgG2b, IgG3, and IgA antibodies of maternal
origin could be detected in the stomach and small intestinal
contents of young mice (Figure S4A). Further, IgG2b- and
IgG3-bound bacteria were present in the stomach and intestinal
lumen of 2-week-old mice in the absence of added sera (Figures
S4B and S4C).
To corroborate these results, we mated mMT+/� dams with B
cell-deficient mMT�/� sires so that approximately half of the re-
sulting offspring lack B cells and therefore any antibodies in
these mice are of maternal origin. As expected, maternal IgM
was not transferred to B cell deficient offspring, as evidenced
by the negligible serum IgM titers and IgM-bound bacteria in
mMT�/� pups (Figure S4D) (Kane and Acquah, 2009). In contrast,
commensal-specific, maternally derived IgG3 and IgG2b anti-
bodies were readily detected by mFLOW and ELISA analysis in
offspring at 2 to 3 weeks of age (Figure 4C). Thus, commensal-
specific IgG antibodies are maternally acquired and coordinate
with IgA to facilitate immune recognition of the microbiota.
Maternal Antibodies Regulate Mucosal Helper T Cell
Activation
During the weaning period, the shift in diet coupled with the
reduced concentrations of immunoregulatory factors from breast
milk drive changes in the composition of the microbiota (Laukens
et al., 2016). To determine if maternally derived commensal-spe-
cific antibodies help establish appropriate immune responses in
the neonatal gut, we compared offspring of B cell deficient and

 B cell sufficient dams at d25–26 post-birth. We did not observe
any gross differences in CD8 Teff, Tregs, gd T cells, NK cells, den-
dritic cells or neutrophils at this time (Figure S5A and data not
shown). However, we did detect an increase in both the fre-
quency and number of CD4+Foxp3�CD44hi Teff cells isolated
from the mLN and PP of mice lacking maternal antibodies
compared to controls (Figure 5A). This was accompanied by an
expansion of CD69+ CD4+ T cells in maternal-antibody deficient
mice, indicating these T cells had recently experienced TCR-
mediated activation (Figure 5B).
This prompted us to test whether the absence of maternal
antibodies allowed translocation of commensal microbes that
would otherwise be restricted to the lumen or rapidly cleared
upon entry. At the time of weaning, bacteria were routinely pre-
sent in the mLN of pups lacking maternal antibodies yet rarely
detectable in WT born offspring (Figure 5C). To assess whether
the expanded CD4 T cells were activated in an antigen-specific
fashion by these bacteria, we restricted the specificity of T cells
to the non-microbial antigen ovalbumin using OT-II TCR-trans-
genic mice. We bred B cell sufficient and deficient females to
hemizygous OT-II TCR transgenic sires and analyzed the result-
ing offspring at d26 post birth. Approximately half of each litter
has a polyclonal T cell repertoire, while the others inherit the
OT-II transgene resulting in a restricted T cell repertoire. As pre-
viously, we observed a significant increase in the frequency of
polyclonal Teff in pups of B cell deficient dams as compared to
mice with WT mothers (Figure S5B). Strikingly, the enhanced
Teff response was abrogated in offspring of mMT�/� dams con-
taining a restricted T cell repertoire (Figure S5B). This suggests
that Th cells from maternal antibody deficient mice are
inappropriately activated in response to antigens derived from
commensal microbes. It is also possible that other constituents
of the microbiota, such as endogenous viruses or fungi,
contribute to this response (Pfeiffer and Virgin, 2016).
To confirm the accumulation of Teff cells in pups lacking
maternal antibodies resulted from differences in maternal anti-
body concentrations rather than variation in the composition
of the inherited microbiota (Ubeda et al., 2012), we co-housed
wild-type and mMT�/� female mice for 5 weeks prior to breeding
to equilibrate the microbial composition of the two strains. Sec-
ond, we generated and analyzed the progeny from littermate
mMT+/� and mMT�/� dams. In the latter experiment, dams in-
herited identical microbiota from B cell sufficient mothers and
were cohoused until approximately 4 days prior to parturition.
In both experiments, we again observed an expansion in the fre-
quency of CD4 Teff and activated CD69+Foxp3� Th cells within
the mLN and PP of mice lacking maternal antibodies (Figures
S5C and S5D). Finally, we cross-fostered a portion of progeny
born to antibody sufficient or deficient dams 1 day after birth.
Pups reared by mMT�/� females had reduced titers of serum
IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies, correlating with similar increases
in Teff and activated CD69+Foxp3� Th cells in the mLN and
PP compared with pups reared by WT dams, regardless of
genotype (Figure 5D, S5E, and S5F). Thus, enhanced T cell acti-
vation results from a lack of maternal antibodies rather than dif-
ferences in the composition of the inherited microbiota. Further,
acquisition of maternal antibodies post-birth, rather than in
utero, is required to dampen mucosal T cell activation in young
mice.
Maternal IgG and IgA Cooperate to Limit Mucosal T Cell
Responses
Within mammary tissue, the polymeric Ig receptor transports IgA
and, to a lesser extent, IgM into breast milk. IgA has been
proposed to promote barrier function by limiting bacterial inter-
action with the intestinal epithelium and preventing microbial
translocation to underlying tissues (Rogier et al., 2014). To ascer-
tain if maternal IgA was required to dampen mucosal Th cell re-
sponses, we compared offspring of IgA-deficient dams with
progeny of WT or mMT�/� dams at d25 post-birth. In contrast
to pups lacking all maternal antibodies, we observed equivalent
accumulation of Teff and activated CD4+Foxp3�CD69+ T cells in
the mLN and PP of mice born to either WT or IgA-deficient dams
(Figure 6A). Thus, surprisingly, maternal IgA is dispensable for
the initial regulation of gut Th cell responses.
Considering our findings that anti-commensal IgG2b and IgG3
are acquired maternally and bind the microbiota of young mice,
we tested whether lack of these antibodies underlies the expan-
sion of commensal-specific T cells. FcRn is required for acquisi-
tion of maternal IgG antibodies in utero and transports lumenal
IgG across the intestinal epithelium of neonates (Roopenian
and Akilesh, 2007); however, our analyses of FcRn-deficient
and FcRn-sufficient pups born to Fcrn+/� dams revealed no al-
terations of T cell responses (Figure 6B). This agrees with the
cross-fostering experiment (Figure 5D, S5E), indicating that
maternal antibodies acquired from the breast milk, rather than
in utero, are necessary and sufficient to prevent mucosal T cell
responses. While FcRn N-deficient pups had significantly
reduced serum titers of maternal IgG2b and IgG3, both FcRn-
deficient and FcRn-sufficient animals have similar levels of
maternal IgG in their lumen (Figures S6A and S6B). FcRn has
also been implicated in transporting IgG into breastmilk (Hurley
and Theil, 2011; Roopenian et al., 2003), so we tested levels of
maternally acquired IgG2b and IgG3 in pups born to Fcrn�/�
dams. Concentrations of IgG2b and IgG3 were reduced in the in-
testinal lumen and blood of pups born to FcRn-deficient dams,
but the defect was incomplete when compared to offspring of
mMT�/� dams (Figure S6C and data not shown). In addition,
similar to our results of maternal IgA-deficient mice, we saw no
increase in CD4 Teff and CD69+Foxp3� activated Th cells in
mucosal tissues of pups of FcRn-deficient dams compared to
control offspring (Figures 6C, S6D).

 Finally, we considered that maternal IgA and FcRn-dependent
IgG antibodies might coordinate to regulate mucosal T cell re-
sponses and mask any effect in pups born to FcRn or IgA singly
deficient mice, especially considering the incomplete block in
IgG acquisition in offspring of FcRn-deficient dams. To test
this, we generated dams lacking both FcRn and IgA and bred
these to WT males. We observed significant increases in the fre-

to mucosal antigens.
Compensatory Germinal Center
Responses Restore Homeostasis in
Mice Lacking Maternal Antibodies
We next sought to ascertain the conse-
quences, if any, of this immune dysregula-
tion. Mice born to mMT�/� dams consis-
tently weighed 10%–15% less than pups
born to mMT+/� dams at d25 post-birth,
but this difference resolved in older mice
(Figure 7A, S7A). Similarly, young mice
lacking
maternal
antibodies
showed
slightly elevated levels of inflammatory
serum cytokines and fecal lipocalin-2
when challenged with dextran sodium sul-
fate, but no difference was observed in
older mice (Figures S7B and S7C) (Chas-
saing et al., 2012). This suggested that
the dysregulation in young animals lacking
maternal antibodies may be transient and
that mechanisms may exist to restore
homeostasis in older mice. Consistent with this possibility, we
observed expansion of activated CD4 T cells only in young mice
(Figure 7B).
To better characterize the Th cell response in mice lacking
maternal antibodies and examine how homeostasis may be
restored, we profiled expression of transcription factors and traf-
ficking receptors on CD4 Teff cells isolated from offspring of
834
Cell 165, 827–841, May 5, 2016
 maternal antibody sufficient or deficient dams. We observed no
reproducible difference in the proportion of T-bet+ or RORgT+
Teff cells in mice born to antibody-deficient dams as compared
to controls (Figure 7C). Instead we found a marked expansion of
CD4 Teff cells expressing the Tfh markers PD-1 and CXCR5 in
pups devoid of maternal antibodies (Figure 7C). T follicular helper
(Tfh) cells reside in the follicles of secondary lymphoid organs
such as the mLN and PP where they provide help to differenti-
ating B cells within germinal centers (GCs), thereby facilitating
the production of high affinity, class switched antibodies (Crotty,
2014). Correlating with increased Tfh cells, we observed more
GC B cells within the mLN and PP of maternal antibody-deficient
mice as compared to control offspring (Figure 7D). Expectedly,
the activation of CD4 T cells preceded the expansion of GC
B cells (Figure 7E). Notably, offspring of dams deficient solely
in IgA did not exhibit increased frequencies or numbers of GC
B cells in the mLN and PP (Figures 7F, S7D), consistent with
the lack of Teff cells expansion in these mice (Figure 6A).

 DISCUSSION
Here we characterize a mechanism that limits immune re-
sponses to newly acquired commensal antigens in neonates.
We report a broad, anti-commensal, TI IgG response, composed
primarily of IgG2b and IgG3 isotypes, that is partially dependent
on TLR2 and TLR4. Maternally acquired IgG and IgA limit
mucosal T cell activation and subsequent T-dependent B cell re-
sponses during early life. At the time of weaning, commensal mi-
crobes localize close to the intestinal epithelium (Rogier et al.,
2014), and maternal antibodies limit bacterial translocation to
the mLN (Figure 5C). In the absence of maternal antibodies,
new commensal antigens induce a compensatory T-dependent
antibody
response
that
appears
to
restore
homeostasis.
Whether such aberrant T and B cell responses lead to other
long-term consequences remains unclear and is an important
topic for further study. Nevertheless, our work shows that control
of T-dependent immunity to gut microbes requires instructional
cues from TI antibodies and the innate immune system.
Commensal-specific IgA and IgG may work by distinct mecha-
nisms and in discrete anatomical compartments to regulate intes-
tinal immunity. IgA may entrap microbes in the lumen, while IgG2b
and IgG3 antibodies regulate responses to translocated mi-
crobes. Importantly, lumenal IgG can be transported into the sys-
temic circulation, and maternal IgG antibodies present on both
sides of the intestinal epithelium may cooperate to limit mucosal
responses. Coating of bacteria by breast milk-derived IgG
may function similarly to IgA by discouraging bacterial associa-
tion with the intestinal epithelium; IgG could also enhance
bacterial sampling by FcRn-expressing intestinal epithelial cells.

 Additionally, maternal-derived IgG antibodies may coat naked mi-
crobes sampled at inductive sites to facilitate microbial clearance.
These two compartments of maternal IgG cooperate with IgA to
ensure intestinal homeostasis such that, in the absence of either
IgA or IgG, antibodies of the other isotype are sufficient to quell
aberrant immune responses. Dual recognition of microbes by
both IgA and IgG highlight the cooperative nature of these
antibodies (Figures 2A and 2B). While our study demonstrates
the importance of commensal-specific IgG antibodies when
acquired maternally, it is certainly possible that they serve impor-
tant functions in adults.
Notably, IgG can engage immune effector mechanisms
that IgA cannot. IgG2b and IgG3 may target whole microbes to
intestinal macrophages for rapid, non-inflammatory clearance.
A recent paper proposed that maternal IgG delivers microbial
molecules to offspring, which increases the number of intestinal
type 3 innate lymphoid cells and reinforces barrier integrity (Go-
mez de Agu
¨ ero et al., 2016). Similar mechanisms may underlie
the immune activation we observe. Alternatively, ligation of Fc
receptors or complement receptors on mucosal dendritic cells
by IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies may modulate the immunostimu-
latory capacity of commensal microbes or microbial compo-
nents, perhaps by preventing production of polarizing cytokines,
thereby influencing T cell differentiation. Mouse IgG2b binds
both activating and inhibitory Fc receptors, whereas mouse
IgG3 binds to complement receptor 2 and FcgR1 (Bruhns,
2012; Dı
´az de Sta
˚ hl et al., 2003). Interestingly, a unique receptor
for mouse IgG3 has been proposed but remains undiscovered
(Saylor et al., 2010).
IgG3 and IgG2b producing B cells are considerably less
frequent than their IgA-secreting counterparts, yet the breadth
of IgG-mediated recognition of the microbiota exceeded that
of IgA. Anti-commensal IgG antibodies may recognize common
features of commensal microbes. In support of this, we gener-
ated a hybridoma that produced IgG3 capable of binding multi-
ple Lactobacillus isolates, including L. salivarius, L. brevis, and
L. murinus (data not shown). As anti-commensal IgG responses
were largely dependent on B cell intrinsic TLR2 and TLR4 stim-
ulation by microbial ligands (Figure 4), it is possible that these
antibodies target TLR ligands, namely bacterial lipopeptides
and LPS, although our preliminary analyses suggest this po-
ssibility is unlikely. While our study was under review, another
group described T-dependent, anti-commensal IgG antibodies
that cross-react with gram-negative pathogens such as Salmo-
nella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella) (Zeng et al.,
2016). We did not observe binding of Salmonella or C. rodentium
by IgG3 or IgG2b from sera of healthy mice from our colony or
Jackson Labs (Figure S1B). These conflicting results might result
from differences in the flora of mice used for the two studies.
Interestingly, vaccination of mice with a glycan present on an
E. coli isolate elicited IgG2b, IgG3, and IgM antibodies that
cross-reacted with P. berghei and could restrict parasite burden
following intradermal Plasmodium infection (Yilmaz et al., 2014).
Thus, IgG antibodies elicited by commensal species may help
confer protection to pathogens containing related epitopes.
Considering the overlap in microbes bound by IgG3 and IgA, it
is conceivable that these two isotypes share the same specific-
ities. Indeed, B cells induced to produce IgG3 in vitro undergo
further class switching to secrete IgA upon culture with TGF-b
(Deenick et al., 1999). Binding by IgA can induce downregulation
of antigenson bacteria (Cullender et al., 2013). As IgG3 and IgG2b
antibodies are not secreted into the intestinal lumen and are not in
constant interaction with microbes, we speculate that anti-
commensal IgG antibodies may also target unique antigens to
facilitate recognition of gut microbes that avoid detection by IgA.
Similar to the majority of commensal-specific IgA, T cells were
dispensable for the production of IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies tar-
geting the microbiota (Figure 3) (Bunker et al., 2015; Macpherson
et al., 2000). A recent study demonstrated that a phenotypically
and functionally distinct population of B cells, termed B-1 cells,
was sufficient for production of TI commensal-specific IgA
(Bunker et al., 2015). Following activation by cytokines or micro-
bial products, such as LPS, B-1 cells from the peritoneal and
pleural cavities migrate to the gut LP and secrete IgA (Ha et al.,
2006; Kroese et al., 1989; Moon et al., 2004). As IgG2b+ and
IgG3+ B cells in the mLN and PP expressed increased levels
of the B-1 marker CD43, it is possible that these B cells belong
to the B-1 subset. Precisely how microbiota-derived TLR2 and
TLR4 ligands activate B cells to produce IgG antibodies remains
unclear. B cells may be stimulated by whole microbes sampled
from the lumen (Macpherson and Uhr, 2004), by bacteria colo-
nizing the PP (Obata et al., 2010) or by dissociated microbial li-
gands that access host tissues (Henao-Mejia et al., 2012).
Our characterization of anti-commensal IgG responses helps
reconcile several observations regarding the function of anti-
bodies in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Despite the abun-
dance of IgA within the gut, humans lacking this isotype display
only subtle perturbations in intestinal immunity (Yel, 2010). In
contrast, a proportion of human subjects with low levels of
all circulating antibodies due to common variable immuno-
deficiency syndrome display pronounced intestinal defects
including frequent gastrointestinal infections accompanied by
a lymphoproliferative disorder of the small intestine (Washington
et al., 1996). Some animals (e.g., cows, sheep, and horses) lack
trans-placental
transport
of
maternal
antibodies.
Notably,
newborn calves fail to thrive without antibody-rich colostrum
(Smith and Little, 1922), which, in light of our results, may be
attributed to dysregulated immunity to commensal antigens in
the absence of maternal antibodies.
This study expands our understanding of how appropriate
mucosal immune responses are established following microbial
colonization and reveals how immune dysregulation during
development can influence intestinal homeostasis throughout
life. The importance of maternal IgG has traditionally been
ascribed to provision of passive immunity against a variety of
pathogens, thereby protecting offspring from potentially fatal in-
fections (Niewiesk, 2014). By demonstrating that mice deficient
in maternal antibodies exhibit dysregulated mucosal responses,
our data reveal a broader function for maternal IgG in helping to
establish immune homeostasis early in life.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Mice strains were maintained under SPF conditions at UC Berkeley to
normalize the microbiota as much as possible, except for mice shown in

 Figure 1F, where mice were analyzed upon receipt from the indicated vendor.
For cohousing experiments, mice were combined at 3–4 weeks of age until
breeding age. For breeding of littermate or cohoused dams, females were
separated into individual cages and bred for 2–3 nights, dams were then
‘‘re-cohoused’’ for approximately 18 days. Pregnant females were separated
and housed individually until parturition. All experiments with mice were
performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee at UC Berkeley. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.
Bacterial Strains
Commensal bacterial strains were isolated from wild-type C57Bl/6 mice from
UC Berkeley. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.
Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting
For bacterial flow cytometry, bacteria were washed in sterile-filtered PBS
with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Fisher) and 0.05% Azide (Fisher) and re-
suspended at approximately 5 3 106 bacteria/mL. Mouse serum was diluted
1:25 in PBS/BSA/Azide buffer and 25 mL of this solution was mixed with
25 mL diluted microbes in a v-bottom plate. Staining was performed with fluo-
rochrome-conjugated or biotinylated antibodies followed by streptavidin-
PECy7 (eBioscience). Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS with
SYBR Green (Invitrogen) and analyzed by FACS. Pathogens were resus-
pended in 2% PFA. Unless otherwise stated, feces and serum samples for
mFLOW were taken from the same mouse. For most experiments, we included
both SYBRhi and SYBRmid events in our analyses (referred to as SYBR+).
In some experiments in Figure 1, analysis was restricted to SYBRhi events.
For flow cytometry on mouse cells, dead cells were excluded using a fixable
live/dead stain (Life Technologies) and all stains were carried out in PBS
containing 1%BSA (w/v) and 0.1% Azide (w/v) including anti-CD16/32 block-
ing antibody (2.4G2) and normal rat serum (Sigma). Cells were stained for
20 min at 4�C with surface antibodies. For transcription factor staining, surface
stained cells were permeabilized with Fix/Perm buffer (eBioscience) for 20 min
at 4�C. Cells were washed and stained for 20 min at 4�C with antibodies to
transcription factors. Data were acquired on LSR II or X20 (BD Biosciences).
See Table S2 for antibody details.
Statistics
Statistical significance was determined as indicated in the figure legends with
Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc).
16S rRNA Gene Sequencing and Microbial Community Analysis
16S rRNA sequencing was performed by the Alkek Center for Metagenomics
and Microbiome Research at Baylor College of Medicine using an Illumina
