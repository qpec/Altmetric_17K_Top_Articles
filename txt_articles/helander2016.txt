ABSTRACT
Background: Potent and potentially harmful new psychoactive substances (NPS) are continuously
introduced on the recreational drugs market. This report from the Swedish STRIDA project
describes analytically confirmed cases of intoxication involving the fentanyl analogs acetylfentanyl,
4-methoxybutyrfentanyl, and furanylfentanyl. Methods: Patients with suspected NPS exposure present-
ing in emergency departments and intensive care units in Sweden and requiring hospital care are invited
to the STRIDA project. Toxicological analysis of serum and urine samples was performed by multi-
component liquid chromatographic–mass spectrometric methods. Data on clinical features were
retrieved from telephone consultations with the Swedish Poisons Information Centre and from medical
records. Results: Between April and November 2015, 14 analytically confirmed intoxications involving
acetylfentanyl (nine cases), 4-methoxybutyrfentanyl (3), furanylfentanyl (1), and 4-methoxybutyrfentanyl
together with furanylfentanyl (1) were identified. The patients were aged 20–40 (mean 28.5) years and
86% were men. Twelve patients (86%) were admitted to intensive care, where two required intubation
and mechanical ventilation. Typical clinical features were decreased consciousness, respiratory
depression, and miosis. In eight cases, the antidote naloxone was administered to counter the effects.
The serum acetylfentanyl concentration (N ¼ 7) was 0.6–51.6 (mean 18.3 and median 14.8) ng/mL, and in
urine (N ¼ 8) 0.1–686 (mean 155 and median 66.6) ng/mmol creatinine. The serum 4-methoxybutyrfen-
tanyl concentration (N ¼ 2) was 1.3 and 3.1 ng/mL, and 5.1–51.3 ng/mmol creatinine in urine (N ¼ 3). For
furanylfentanyl, the serum concentrations were 4.4 and 148 ng/mL and in urine 9.2 and 85 ng/mmol
creatinine, respectively. In 13 cases (93%), other NPS and/or classical drugs were also detected. Drug
products brought to hospital by patients contained acetylfentanyl (nasal spray and pink tablet),
4-methoxybutyrfentanyl (green tablet), furanylfentanyl/traces of 4-methoxybutyrfentanyl (nasal spray),
and 4-fluorobutyrfentanyl (purple tablet). Conclusion: Potentially life-threatening opioid toxicity was
seen in acute intoxications involving acetylfentanyl, 4-methoxybutyrfentanyl, and furanylfentanyl.
Intensive care treatment for one month was necessary in one acetylfentanyl case and one acetylfentanyl
patient died from cerebral hemorrhage.

Background
Over the past �7 years, the dramatic increase in the supply of
‘‘new psychoactive substances’’ (NPS) into the recreational
drugs market has represented a growing health concern.[1–3]
The majority of NPS are structural variants of classical drugs of
abuse (‘‘designer drugs’’). The chemical differences may
complicate detection in standard toxicological analysis, and
legislative control is often circumvented (‘‘legal highs’’) by the
use of product labels such as ‘‘not for human consumption’’.
Furthermore, open web-based international trading (‘‘Internet
drugs’’) makes these drugs available even after local laws
prohibit them.[4]
Dealing
with
medical
complications
associated
with
NPS [1,5,6] has become an increasing problem at emergency
departments (ED) and intensive care units (ICU).[7,8] Most
substances introduced on the NPS market are clinically
untested, which increases the risk for harmful events; some
are actually former pharmaceutical candidates that were never
approved for human use.[9] In addition, because the psycho-
active content is often not stated on the package label,[10–12]
there is an obvious risk for overdose.
Opioids
of
natural
(e.g.,
morphine
and
codeine)
or
semisynthetic/synthetic
(heroin,
methadone
and
fentanyl)
origin are responsible for a large proportion of drug-related
morbidity and mortality.[13] An important reason is that typical
symptoms of opioid overdose, such as respiratory depression
and decreased consciousness, are potentially life-threatening,
unless treated with antidote (i.e., the opioid antagonist
naloxone).[14] The NPS comprise an increasing number of
synthetic opioids, such as MT-45, AH-7921, and fentanyl
derivatives, which have been associated with severe adverse
reactions and fatalities.[9,12,13,15,16]

 Fentanyl (Figure 1) is a powerful synthetic opioid analgesic
(�50–100 times the potency of morphine), acting as a strong
m-opioid receptor agonist, with therapeutic applications for
pain management and sedation.[17] Fentanyl is also associated
with abuse, currently often involving transdermal patches, and
a common cause of drug-related serious adverse events and
deaths.[13,18,19]
Derivatives
of
fentanyl,
synthesized
as
pharmaceutical candidates or produced in clandestine labora-
tories as drugs of abuse, have also been involved in fatal
poisonings.[20] The first abused ‘‘designer’’ fentanyls were
a-methylfentanyl and 3-methylfentanyl that appeared in the
USA around 1980 in laced heroin products or as heroin
substitute (‘‘China White’’).[21,22] Outbreaks of fatalities caused
by 3-methylfentanyl also appeared in Estonia in 2004–
2008.[19,23] Yet other fentanyl analogs were involved in the
Moscow theatre hostage casualties in 2002.[24]
Acetylfentanyl (Figure 1) is another potent fentanyl analog
that was implicated in numerous overdose deaths in Russia
and the USA in 2012–2014.[25–27] Acetylfentanyl, and the
analogs butyrfentanyl and 4-fluorobutyrfentanyl (4F-butyrfen-
tanyl), were first notified by the European Union Early Warning
System operated by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs
and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol in 2014. Cases
of medical complications associated with butyrfentanyl and
4F-butyrfentanyl have been reported.[12] Recently, two other
fentanyls, 4-methoxybutyrfentanyl (4-MeO-butyrfentanyl; also
known as 4-MeO-BF) and furanylfentanyl (Fu-F) (Figure 1), have
appeared as NPS.
This case series presents analytically confirmed intoxications
involving acetylfentanyl, 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl, or furanylfenta-
nyl identified in Sweden in 2015 within the STRIDA project.[7,8]
Methods
Cases and data acquisition
STRIDA (an acronym of the Swedish project name) was started
in 2010 to monitor the occurrence and health hazards of newly
emerging drugs of abuse in Sweden.[7,8] The project com-
prises intoxication cases with admitted or suspected involve-
ment of NPS, or unknown drugs of abuse, presenting in ED and
ICU over the country. Cases are invited to the project, after
initial telephone consultation with the Swedish Poisons
Information Centre (PIC), a nationwide 24/7 service to health
care givers and the public. The use of a project code number
and a special laboratory request form allows free-of-charge
toxicological analysis.
Samples of blood (serum) and urine are collected as soon as
possible after admission to the ED/ICU and forwarded to the
Karolinska University Laboratory (Stockholm) for analysis of
psychoactive
substance
contents.
Biological
samples
are
obtained in about half of all suspected NPS-related cases
registered at the PIC.[28] Data on clinical features are retrieved
from the PIC consultations and from medical records. The
severity of intoxication is graded retrospectively using the
Poisoning Severity Score (PSS),[29] and the level of conscious-
ness using the Reaction Level Scale (RLS) or Glasgow Coma
Scale (GCS).[30] The STRIDA project is conducted in accordance
with the Helsinki Declaration and is approved by the regional
ethical review board (No. 2013/116–31/2).
Laboratory analysis
Laboratory analysis of fentanyl and its analogs acetylfentanyl,
4-MeO-butyrfentanyl, butyrfentanyl, 4F-butyrfentanyl, and fur-
anylfentanyl in serum (parent compounds) and urine (parent
compounds,
and
their
N-dealkylated
nor-metabolites
[12,27,31,32] which were used as qualifiers to confirm drug
intake), together with a comprehensive toxicological analysis
of other NPS, classical drugs of abuse, and prescription
pharmaceuticals (currently �250 parent compounds or metab-
olites are covered)[7] was performed by multi-component
liquid chromatographic–tandem mass spectrometric (LC–MS/
MS) and LC–high-resolution MS (LC–HRMS) methods, as
detailed elsewhere.[7,8,33] The methods are continuously
updated, as new substances are introduced on the NPS
market and reference material becomes available.
Acetylfentanyl, butyrfentanyl, and 4F-butyrfentanyl (refer-
ence material from Cayman Chemical) have been tested for
retrospectively since December 2014.[12] Reference materials
used for identification of 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl and furanylfen-
tanyl (retrospectively tested for since March 2015) were tablets
from a test purchase from a Swedish NPS website and a nasal
spray brought to hospital by a patient, respectively. Analysis of
the purchased product, and of NPS products brought to hospital
by patients, was performed by LC–quadrupole-time-of-flight–
MS/MS (LC–QTOF–MS/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy at the Swedish Medical Products Agency
(Uppsala).[34] Due to the lack of certified reference materials,
preliminary quantification of 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl and furanyl-
fentanyl was based on the comparison with butyrfentanyl
standard (the absolute area response for equimolar standards of
fentanyl, acetylfentanyl and butyrfentanyl in LC–HRMS was
100 ± 2%, but only 63% for 4F-butyrfentanyl).
The lower quantification limit (LLOQ) for fentanyl analogs in
serum and urine was50.5 ng/mL and the routine measuring
range 0.5–1000 ng/mL.

 to early November 2015, 11 cases were coded as acetylfentanyl
intoxications, nine of which originated from hospitals and four
(44%) eventually enrolled in the STRIDA project (i.e., serum
and/or urine samples were provided for toxicological analysis).
There has only been one consultation related to furanylfenta-
nyl (early November 2015) and no one on 4-MeO-butyrfenta-
nyl. During the same period, three hospitalized cases of
butyrfentanyl or 4F-butyrfentanyl poisoning [12] were reported
and enrolled in the STRIDA project, but not included in this
study.
Results of laboratory investigations of biological
samples
From the end of April to early November 2015, �350 acute
intoxication cases were enrolled in the STRIDA project and the
serum and urine samples analyzed for new and classical drugs
contents. During this period, 14 analytically confirmed intoxi-
cations involving acetylfentanyl (nine cases), 4-methoxybutyr-
fentanyl (3), furanylfentanyl (1), and 4-methoxybutyrfentanyl
together with furanylfentanyl (1) were identified (Table 1).
The first acetylfentanyl case appeared in the end of April,
and the first involving 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl and furanylfenta-
nyl in the end of June and mid-October, respectively. All
4-MeO-butyrfentanyl positive cases contained also other fen-
tanyl analogs: 4F-butyrfentanyl in two, furanylfentanyl in one,
and 4F-butyrfentanyl and butyrfentanyl in one case. The cases
were seemingly unrelated, as they originated from different
parts of the country and appeared on different days, except for
one patient who tested positive for furanylfentanyl twice at
about 3 weeks interval, the first time in combination with
4-MeO-butyrfentanyl. Low concentrations of fentanyl were
detected in some cases (Table 1), but this was most likely
treatment related.
The 14 patients were aged 20–40 (mean 28.5 and median
28) years, and 12 (86%) were men. Reported routes of drug
administration were oral intake of tablets or powder in three
cases, nasal intake/snorting of powder in one case, and
intramuscular injection of a nasal spray liquid after initial
unsatisfactory nasal administration in one case (Table 1).
Detailed information on the amounts of drug taken was
missing.
The sampling time ranged from �1–24 h after arrival in the
ED/ICU. In cases where both serum and urine was available for
analysis, acetylfentanyl, 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl, and furanylfen-
tanyl were detected in both matrices in all but one (Table 1).
The acetylfentanyl concentration in serum (Figure 2; N ¼ 7)
ranged from 0.6 to 51.6 (mean 18.3 and median 14.8) ng/mL,
and in urine (N ¼ 8) from 2.4–3180 (mean 936 and median 701)
ng/mL; when corrected for variations in urine dilution, the
urine levels were 0.1–686 (mean 155 and median 66.6) ng/
mmol creatinine. The expected negative correlation between
acetylfentanyl concentration (log values) and time between
ED/ICU arrival and sampling (r ¼ �0.78 for serum, and �0.92 for
creatinine-corrected urine values) was statistically significant
(p ¼ 0.038 and 0.003, respectively; MedCalc Software, SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL).
The 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl concentration in serum (Figure 2;
N ¼ 3) was 1.3–11 (mean 5.1) ng/mL, and in urine 15.8–1000
(mean 348) ng/mL or 5.1–51.3 (mean 22.8) ng/mmol creatinine.
The concentration of furanylfentanyl (Figure 2) was 4.4 and
148 ng/mL in serum, and in urine 179 and 1430 ng/mL or 9.2
and 85 ng/mmol creatinine, respectively (Table 1).
Most cases (93%) also tested positive for various mixtures of
other drugs. Accordingly, several other NPS and classical drugs
of abuse were detected (Table 1). Analytically confirmed
intoxications involving 4F-butyrfentanyl (2 cases) and butyr-
fentanyl (1), that were covered in a previous publication from
the STRIDA project,[12] were also detected.
Results of laboratory investigations of drug products
Two patients testing positive for acetylfentanyl brought drug
products to the hospital. One item (from case #1 in Table 1)
was a nasal spray labeled Nasoferm, the brand name of a
commercial nasal decongestant product, while the other (from
case #3) was unlabeled transparent plastic bags containing
pink, green, or purple disk-shaped tablets (9–10 mm diameter)
with no markings. Acetylfentanyl was demonstrated to be the
main constituent of the nasal spray, although there were also
traces of xylometazoline, the active substance in the Nasoferm
nasal decongestant. This indicates reuse of a nasal decongest-
ant spray bottle. The colored tablets contained acetylfentanyl
(pink),
4-MeO-butyrfentanyl
(green),
and
4F-butyrfentanyl
(purple), with no other psychoactive substances detected.
The patient testing positive for furanylfentanyl (case #12)
brought a nasal spray (unlabeled blue bottle) that contained
mainly furanylfentanyl and55% 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl.
Patients also brought tablets containing zolpidem and the
prescription or designer benzodiazepines alprazolam, clonazo-
lam, clonazepam, and flubromazolam.
A furanylfentanyl powder originating from a test purchase,
intended for use as a reference material, was demonstrated to
only contain furanylfentanyl.
Clinical findings and treatment
Eleven patients (79%) were transported to hospital by ambu-
lance. Initially, clinical features of opioid intoxication such as a
decreased level of consciousness, respiratory depression, and
miosis were present in nine patients (Table 2). Naloxone
injection was administered to reverse opioid-induced respira-
tory depression, except for case #2 (Table 1) for whom
immediate intubation and ventilator support was necessary,
due to pulmonary aspiration. For the same reason, two
additional patients were subsequently put on ventilator
(cases #6 and #12 in Table 1).
Eleven patients (79%) were admitted to the ICU. ICU
observation over 1–2 hospital days was needed for eight
patients, whereas the other three needed support for 28 (case
#2), 5 (case #3), and 7 (case #6) d. The protracted clinical course
in case #2 was related to difficulties in weaning caused by
recurring episodes of severe agitation, delirium, and hyper-
thermia. No drug other than acetylfentanyl was detected in this
case.
Case #3 had a pronounced rhabdomyolysis (plasma myo-
globin 70,300 mg/L) on arrival, with an initial potassium level of

 7.1 mmol/L and peaked T-waves on the electrocardiogram. He
had been unconscious and lying on the floor for several hours
prior to admission and developed signs of ischemic damage
with swelling, paresthesia, and skin redness at the area of the
dorsal muscles of the thighs, but no outright compartment
syndrome. He developed a transient acute kidney injury (AKI;
plasma creatinine 561 mg/L) and was treated with hemodialysis
for 3 d. The drug analysis revealed combined exposure to
acetylfentanyl and other CNS depressing agents (clonazepam
and ethanol).
Similarly, case #6 was found unresponsive after a prolonged
period of unconsciousness with a core temperature of only
28.0 �C (82.4 �F) and ischemic injuries as pressure ulcers on the
leg muscles (serum CK 475 mkat/L) and AKI with a peak serum
creatinine of 485 mg/L. This patient was initially ventilated with
a face mask and vomited repeatedly, after naloxone adminis-
tration had brought him to consciousness. He became
aggressive and police assistance was needed. On admission
to the ICU, the patient was sedated and intubated. He was
rewarmed, treated for aspiration pneumonia, and his kidney
function recovered after fluid administration. He was extubated
on hospital day 6 and sent to an intermediate care unit the
following day. On hospital day 13, he suddenly became
delirious and had repeated tonic clonic seizures from which he
recovered. No explanation for the seizures was found. Drug
analysis of urine collected on ICU admission confirmed mixed
intake of acetylfentanyl together with CNS stimulant and
depressant agents (Table 1). Additional samples for drug
analysis were not collected at the time of the seizure.
One patient (case #9), did not survive despite full intensive
care. He had a documented history of mixed drug abuse and
was hepatitis C positive. He arrived to hospital in a CNS
depressed state, with only a weak response to painful stimuli
and no pupil reaction to light, but was breathing spontan-
eously. On admission to the ICU, he had a sudden apnea and
became hypertensive (260/170 mmHg), his unconsciousness
deepened (RLS 8), and the pupils were dilated. Intubation
decreased the blood pressure but it required high norepin-
ephrine doses to achieve adequate mean arterial pressure. A
computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed a recent
hemorrhage, which the next day had progressed and included
a cerebral edema. Life-supporting critical care was terminated
and the patient died �24 h after hospital arrival. Despite late
sampling, drug analysis of urine and serum confirmed mixed
intake of acetylfentanyl and CNS stimulants (Table 1). Whether
the fentanyl also detected related to intensive care or abuse is
unknown.
Discussion
The present results from the STRIDA project confirm a
continued incidence in Sweden of cases of overdose by
potent novel synthetic fentanyl analogs that are made avail-
able through NPS websites. Following acute intoxication cases
involving butyrfentanyl and 4F-butyrfentanyl that appeared in
2014,[12] also acetylfentanyl, 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl, and fura-
nylfentanyl have been analytically confirmed in 2015.
Threads on acetylfentanyl were started on international
online drug discussion forums in 2012,[35,36] whereas on a

 Swedish drug forum, it first appeared in August 2014.[37]
However, it was not until the end of April 2015 that
intoxication cases suspected to involve acetylfentanyl were
first reported during consultation with the Swedish PIC and
cases were analytically confirmed within the STRIDA project. 4-
MeO-butyrfentanyl and furanylfentanyl started to be discussed
on international [38,39] and Swedish [40,41] online drug
forums in the end of April 2015, whereas the first analytically
confirmed intoxications in the STRIDA project appeared in the
end of July and mid-October, respectively. The emergence of 4-
MeO-butyrfentanyl and furanylfentanyl was likely linked to the
classification of acetylfentanyl, butyrfentanyl (both as narcotic
substances), and 4F-butyrfentanyl (as harmful to health) in
Sweden on 18 August 2015. After this date, the latter three
analogs were no longer listed on Swedish NPS websites
and only few positive cases have been detected, the latest in

 mid-September. 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl and furanylfentanyl are
currently not regulated in Sweden.
All fentanyl analogs act primarily as m-opioid receptor
agonists and the differences in pharmacological effects are due
to differences in potency (i.e., receptor affinity and onset and
duration of action). An inherent problem of fentanyls as
recreational drugs is their high potency,[42] which complicates
dosing and increases the risk of overdose. Among the present
intoxication cases that involved acetylfentanyl, 4-MeO-butyr-
fentanyl, and furanylfentanyl, and sometimes also butyrfenta-
nyl and 4F-butyrfentanyl, unconsciousness and respiratory
depression, which are typical and potentially life-threatening
opioid symptoms, were common.
Compared with postmortem blood acetylfentanyl concen-
trations in forensic autopsy cases (
4200 ng/mL),[43,44] the
serum levels in the present cases of acute intoxication were
four-fold or more lower and all except one patient survived.
Nevertheless, considering that respiratory depression and
unconsciousness were common manifestations, more patients
may have died unless rapidly brought to hospital and treated
symptomatically with naloxone. According to statistics from
the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine (personal
communication, November 2015), acetylfentanyl was reported
as the cause of death, either alone or in combination with
other drugs, in 26 cases in April–October 2015. Related to the
fact that the number of deaths linked to acetylfentanyl
exceeded the number of confirmed non-fatal intoxications in
Sweden during the same time period, the need for expanded
availability of naloxone to treat potentially fatal opioid
overdose is emphasized. In Sweden, naloxone is currently
only available for paramedics and at hospital.
Related to the serum concentrations of acetylfentanyl,
4-MeO-butyrfentanyl, and furanylfentanyl, it should be noted
that information on dosing, route of administration, and the
time passing between drug intake and arrival in the ED/ICU
was often missing. According to information on a Swedish drug
chat forum, many different routes of administration have been
used for these fentanyl analogs (oral intake of powder or
tablets, nasal intake of powder or spray, sublingual and
intravenous administration, and smoking/inhalation using a
vaporizer), with nasal spray being the most common.[37,40,41]
Furthermore, the time between ED/ICU arrival and blood and
urine sampling was also highly variable and ranged up to
�24 h; in the latter case, the serum acetylfentanyl concentra-
tion was very low, due to the relatively short half-life (hours) of
fentanyls.[17]
The serum concentrations of 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl and
furanylfentanyl were generally lower relative to acetylfentanyl,
although 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl was reported to be less potent
in studies on mice.[42] However, it should be noted that all
4-MeO-butyrfentanyl positive cases also tested positive for
other fentanyl analogs (4F-buturfentanyl, butyrfentanyl, and/or
furanylfentanyl); in cases #10–12, the 4F-butyrfentanyl concen-
tration was actually higher (Table 1). In case #12, who brought
a nasal spray that mainly contained furanylfentanyl and a small
amount of 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl, this indicated use of an
additional source of 4-MeO-butyrfentanyl.
As
previously
demonstrated
in
the
STRIDA
pro-
ject,[9,12,28,45–48] poly-drug use was common, making it
difficult to link clinical features to a specific substance. This
indicates that PIC data collected during telephone consultation
may be less accurate regarding the specific substance used,
and highlights the importance of analytical confirmation in
cases of NPS intoxication. In this respect, the observation of
frequent combined use of fentanyl analogs and prescription/
designer benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants was
clinically important. Two of the cases pay attention to this
dilemma, where severe complications appeared as a conse-
quence of prolonged unconsciousness.
In summary, this case series confirm a continued incidence
of use of novel potent fentanyl analogs that are introduced on
the drugs of abuse market through NPS websites. Because
there are yet many uncontrolled fentanyl analogs available that
could replace those that become banned,[49] there is a
continued high risk for serious intoxications and deaths
associated with this type of extremely dangerous drugs,
causing
potentially
life-threatening
respiratory
depression
and sedation.
