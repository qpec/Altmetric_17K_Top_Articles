Molecular checkpoints that trigger the onset of islet autoimmunity or progression to human type 1 diabetes (T1D) 
are incompletely understood. Using T cells from children at an early stage of islet autoimmunity without clinical 
T1D, we find that a microRNA181a (miRNA181a)–mediated increase in signal strength of stimulation and costim-
ulation links nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) with impaired tolerance induction and autoimmune 
activation. We show that enhancing miRNA181a activity increases NFAT5 expression while inhibiting FOXP3+ reg-
ulatory T cell (Treg) induction in vitro. Accordingly, Treg induction is improved using T cells from NFAT5 knockout 
(NFAT5ko) animals, whereas altering miRNA181a activity does not affect Treg induction in NFAT5ko T cells. More-
over, high costimulatory signals result in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–mediated NFAT5, which interferes 
with FoxP3+ Treg induction. Blocking miRNA181a or NFAT5 increases Treg induction in murine and humanized 
models and reduces murine islet autoimmunity in vivo. These findings suggest targeting miRNA181a and/or 
NFAT5 signaling for the development of innovative personalized medicines to limit islet autoimmunity.
INTRODUCTION
Clinical type 1 diabetes (T1D) is presumed to develop from autoimmune 
destruction of the pancreatic insulin-producing  cells (1), resulting in 
hyperglycemia. The incidence of T1D is rising markedly, especially in 
young children with the appearance of multiple islet autoantibodies 
marking the onset of islet autoimmunity (2). Thereafter, the time from 
this asymptomatic phase of islet autoimmunity to progression to meta-
bolic T1D is highly plastic, ranging from several months to more than 
two decades (3). A rapid progression to clinical T1D is indicative of 
multiple layers of tolerance defects and aberrant immune activation. How-
 
ever, despite recent insights into identifying a divergent autoantigen- 
responsive CD4+ T cell population in infants before developing islet 
autoimmunity (4), molecular underpinnings involved in triggering 
the onset of islet autoimmunity remain incompletely understood.
Peripheral T cell tolerance is mainly executed by regulatory T cells 
(Tregs). The X chromosome–encoded forkhead domain containing 
transcription factor Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3)  is a lineage- 
specifying factor responsible for the differentiation and function of 
CD25+CD4+ Tregs (5, 6). Binding of a strong-agonistic antigen to the 
T cell receptor (TCR) on naïve CD4+ T cells under subimmunogenic 
conditions results in efficient FOXP3+ Treg induction (7–10). High 
doses of TCR ligands and strong costimulatory signals activate the 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapa-
mycin (mTOR)  pathway, thereby interfering with Treg induction (11). 
Therefore, control of PI3K signaling by phosphatase and tensin ho-
molog (PTEN) is essential for Treg function and lineage stability.
Ex vivo frequencies of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–DQ8–
restricted insulin-specific Tregs were critically reduced during islet auto-
immunity onset or in children with a fast progression to clinical T1D 
(12), accompanied by an increase in insulin-specific T follicular helper 
(TFH) precursor cells (13). In contrast, high frequencies of insulin- 
specific Tregs were associated with profound delays in progressing to 
symptomatic T1D (12). However, a mechanistic understanding of rel-
evant promoters of T cell activation involved in triggering islet auto-
immunity is still lacking.
On the basis of their ability to regulate cellular states including T cell 
activation, we focused on microRNAs (miRNAs) (14). miRNA- 
mediated 
gene regulation comprises a variety of mechanisms including the ca-
nonical function of target gene inhibition, relief of miRNA- 
mediated 
repression, or miRNAs that in dependence of cellular state and func-
tion, can contribute to a potential activation of targeting sites (15–17).
The nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) represents a func-
tionally and structurally unique member of this transcription factor 
family (18, 19). Besides its role in regulating transcription in response 
to hyperosmolar stimuli, NFAT5 exerts important functions after other

stimuli including TCR-dependent mechanisms (20–22), whereas PI3K 
can contribute to NFAT5 activation (23).
Here, we provide evidence for a profound impairment of Treg in-
duction during islet autoimmunity onset. We demonstrate that an 
miRNA181a-mediated enhanced signal strength of TCR stimula-
tion and costimulation links increased NFAT5 expression with im-
paired Treg induction. An miRNA181a antagomir or a pharmacological 
NFAT5 inhibitor improves Treg induction and reduces murine islet 
autoimmunity in vivo.
RESULTS
Impaired Treg induction during human islet  
autoimmunity onset
We studied Treg induction in vitro using naïve CD4+ T cells from in-
dividual children with different durations of islet autoimmunity with-
 
out clinical T1D (overview in fig. S1). Given the critical role of insulin 
epitopes as target autoantigens, we focused on insulin-specific Treg 
induction using highly pure naïve CD4+ T cells and premature with-
drawal of TCR stimulation after 18 hours without transforming growth 
factor– (11, 12). We therefore used previously established protocols 
using HLA-DQ8 insulin-specific monomers coated onto streptavidin- 
precoated plates (12).
During islet autoimmunity, onset insulin-specific Treg induction 
was significantly (P < 0.001) impaired compared to children without 
islet autoimmunity (Fig. 1A). Insulin-specific Tregs were first identi-
fied as CD4+CD3+CD127loCD25hi T cells (example in fig. S2A, up-
per row; for example, 0.302% of all CD4+CD3+ T cells were identified 
as CD127loCD25hi upon stimulation with HLA-DQ8 insulin-specific 
monomers). Within this, CD127loCD25hi population percentages of 
CD25hiFOXP3hi Tregs were assessed (fig. S2A, upper row; for exam-
ple, 55.6% CD25hiFOXP3hi of 0.302% of CD127lowCD25hi cells). No 
FOXP3hi Tregs were identified upon stimulation with HLA-DQ8 con-
trol monomers (example in fig. S2A, lower row). The functionality of 
induced Tregs was demonstrated previously (12) and was confirmed in 
Treg suppression assays (fig. S2B). Consistent with the reduced insulin- 
specific Treg induction in children with onset of autoimmunity, fre-
quencies of FOXP3intCD4+ T cells were significantly (P < 0.05) increased, 
thereby pointing to activated T cells (no autoimmunity versus recent 
onset of autoimmunity, 16.9 ± 8.4 versus 67.2 ± 11.3 CD25hiFOXP3int 
cells as a percentage of CD127loCD25hiCD4+ T cells, P < 0.05; Fig. 1B 
and fig. S2A).
Upon stimulation with HLA-DQ8 insulin-specific tetramer-based 
artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs; fig. S3), naïve CD4+ T cells 
from children with islet autoimmunity onset proliferated more vigor-
ously (0.11 ± 0.01 CFSEdimCD25+ cells as a percentage of CD4+ T cells) 
compared to autoantibody negative children (0.01 ± 0.003, P < 0.001) 
and nondiabetic children with long-term autoimmunity (0.04 ± 0.01, 
P < 0.05; Fig. 1C). These findings suggest a higher sensitivity to anti-
genic stimulation during islet autoimmunity onset and are in line with 
Fig. 1. Analyses on immune activation versus tolerance induction during islet autoimmunity onset. (A) Frequencies of induced insulin-specific CD127loCD25hiFOXP3hiCD4+

studies showing best Treg induction in T cells that proliferated the least 
(7, 8, 10, 24). The reduced Treg induction potential during islet auto-
immunity onset was confirmed in non–autoantigen-specific assays with 
a hemagglutinin A peptide [HA(307–319) epitope] and in polyclonal 
assays (Fig. 1, D and E).
Reduced Treg induction by miRNA181a-mediated increase in 
signal strength of stimulation
To mechanistically dissect the impaired Treg induction, we determined 
miRNA expression profiles by next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
using CD4+ T cells from children with or without islet autoimmunity 
(Fig. 2A and fig. S4A). Given the reduced Treg induction accompanied 
by increased T cell proliferation, we focused on miRNAs regulating 
signal strength of antigenic stimulation. Specifically, we identified en-
hanced miRNA181a abundance in ex vivo–stimulated CD4+ T cells 
from children with ongoing islet autoimmunity (Fig. 2, A and B). Mu-
rine studies had highlighted that miRNA181a regulates TCR signaling 
strength during T cell development in the thymus (25).
Validation experiments in CD4+ T cells from individual children 
with onset of autoimmunity showed increased miRNA181a abun-
dance (Fig. 2C). By contrast, miRNA181a expression in CD4+ T cells 
from nondiabetic children with long-term autoimmunity was as low 
as that in CD4+ T cells from children without ongoing islet auto-
immunity (Fig. 2C).
We used NGS to determine miRNA181a-mediated regulation on 
mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells, focusing on target genes regulating 
signal strength of antigenic stimulation. Consistent with enhanced 
miRNA181a expression, CD4+ T cells from autoantibody-positive 
children had diminished expression of target genes that negatively 
affect T cell activation, such as Pten, transducer of ERBB2, 1 (Tob1), 
and cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (Ctla4) (Fig. 2D).
In addition, predicted miRNA181a target genes that promote im-
mune activation (Fig. 2D) were up-regulated, accompanied by en-
hanced CD28 expression, suggesting increased costimulatory signaling 
and enhanced signal strength during autoimmunity. Accordingly, the 
expression of NFAT transcription factor family members was en-
hanced (Fig. 2, D and E, and fig. S4F), with Nfat5 being most prom-
inently increased (Fig. 2D).
Validation experiments using CD4+ T cells from individual chil-
dren confirmed increased Nfat5 expression during islet autoimmunity 
onset (Fig. 2E), accompanied by reduced abundance of negative reg-
ulators of T cell activation, such as Pten, Tob1, and Ctla4 (fig. S4, C 
to E). Accordingly, an miRNA181a-mediated suppression of Pten 
promotes PI3K signaling, which, in turn, can contribute to NFAT5 
activation (23).
Promotion of NFAT5 expression by enhancing  
miRNA181a activity
Next, we studied whether modulating miRNA181a activity affects 
Treg induction during autoimmunity. miRNA181a mimics (fig. S5) 
were delivered to CD4+ T cells using established chitosan-coated 
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (26–28). An 
miRNA181a mimic significantly lowered Treg induction (human, P < 
0.01; murine, P < 0.05) while enhancing Nfat5 abundance (P < 0.05) 
and cellular proliferation (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3, A to G). In contrast, block-
ing miRNA181a significantly reduced Nfat5 abundance (P < 0.05) 
(Fig. 3H). Furthermore, stimulated emission depletion (STED) micros-
copy showed that an miRNA181a mimic distinctly enhanced nuclear 
NFAT5 expression (Fig. 3I). Higher costimulation interfered with 
FoxP3+ Treg induction, increased Nfat5, and reduced forkhead box 
protein O1 (Foxo1) expression (fig. S6, A and B).
Blocking miRNA181a significantly enhanced human Treg induc-
tion (without islet autoimmunity, P < 0.001; long-term autoimmu-
nity, P < 0.01; with T1D, P < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). The FOXP3 Treg-specific 
demethylated (TSDR) region shows the most distinct differences con-
cerning the methylation status of the FOXP3 locus: It is completely 
demethylated in Tregs and fully methylated in conventional T cells and 
in Tregs induced by continuous TCR stimulation in vitro (29). We re-
cently had demonstrated that subimmunogenic stimulation of human 
naïve CD4+ T cells in vitro resulted in higher Treg induction efficacy 
and improved Treg stability, as seen from restimulation cultures using 
sort-purified induced Tregs (12). Here, using Treg induction with naïve 
CD4+ T cells and early withdrawal of TCR stimulation, after 14 hours, 
some T cells had already up-regulated high FOXP3 expression and, at 
that early time point, presented with a reduced FOXP3 TSDR methyl-
ation (fig. S7). An miRNA181a antagomir significantly lowered the 
FOXP3 TSDR methylation in such early FOXP3hiCD4+ T cells (P < 
0.001) (fig. S7).
Mechanisms of impaired Treg induction in murine  
islet autoimmunity
To mechanistically dissect Treg induction during islet autoimmunity, 
we next studied nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, which share many 
similarities with human T1D (30–32). Nondiabetic NOD mice with 
recent onset of insulin autoantibodies (IAAs) likewise showed sig-
nificantly impaired Treg induction (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4B), accompanied 
by significantly enhanced miRNA181a (P < 0.01) and Nfat5 (P < 0.05) 
abundance ex vivo (Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, the percentage of cells 
that are NFAT5-positive (and the mean fluorescence intensity of the 
entire population) was increased in CD4+ T cells from IAA+NOD 
mice (fig. S8, A and B).
In ex vivo Tregs of IAA+NOD mice, miRNA181a expression was 
reduced, whereas Nfat5 and Pten expression was unaltered when com-
pared to IAA−NOD mice (fig. S8, C to E). Moreover, CD4+ T cells 
from IAA+NOD mice had higher miRNA181a expression upon TCR 
stimulation, and ex vivo PTEN protein expression was reduced (fig. S8, 
F to H), thereby supporting PI3K signaling and NFAT5 activation.
Next, to dissect a potential involvement of hypertonicity-related 
signaling in mediating Nfat5 enhancement, we analyzed A kinase 
anchoring protein 13 (Akap13) and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated 
kinase 1 (Sgk1) expression in CD4+ T cells from IAA+NOD mice. In 
contrast to Nfat5, Akap13 and Sgk1 mRNAs were unaltered during 
IAA+ autoimmunity (fig. S9, A and B). Likewise, AKAP13hi T cells were 
unchanged (fig. S9, C and D). Furthermore, Treg induction was unaltered 
with T cells from AKAP13 haploinsufficient (+/−) animals (33) com-
pared to wild-type (WT) T cells or with T cells from IAA+NOD mice 
with an Akap13 small interfering RNA (siRNA) compared to control 
siRNA (fig. S9, E to H). Again, blocking miRNA181a distinctly en-
hanced Treg induction using naïve CD4+ T cells from IAA+NOD mice 
(P < 0.001) (Fig. 4E).
Treg induction potential in CD4+ T cells from NFAT5ko mice 
and PTEN Tg mice
Using loss-of-function experiments, naïve CD4+ T cells from NFAT5 
knockout (NFAT5ko) mice (34) showed a significantly increased Treg 
induction potential [CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs (percentage of CD4+ 
T cells), 17.1 ± 2.8 versus 30.3 ± 1.2, P < 0.01; Fig. 5, A and B]. Accord-
ingly, Pten and Foxo1 mRNA abundance was significantly up-regulated

in activated CD4+ T cells from NFAT5ko mice (P < 0.05) (fig. S10, A 
and B). An improved Treg induction was also seen when modifying 
TCR signal strength or costimulation (fig. S10, C to E).
Blocking miRNA181a increased induced Tregs only with naïve 
CD4+ T cells from WT animals (WT + miRNA181a antagomir, 19.8 ± 
6.9% increase in induced CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs compared to con-
trol mice, P < 0.05; Fig. 5C) and not with naïve CD4+ T cells from 
NFAT5ko animals (Fig. 5C). Accordingly, Treg induction was unaltered 
with naïve CD4+ T cells from NFAT5ko mice and an miRNA181a 
mimic (Fig. 5C). Modulating miRNA181a activity likewise did not 
affect Treg induction with naïve CD4+ T cells from NFAT5ko mice 
and low-dose anti-CD3 stimulation (fig. S11, A to D). PI3K inhibi-
tion improved, whereas a PTEN inhibitor decreased, Treg induction 
in T cells from both WT and NFAT5ko mice (Fig. 5, D and E).
Next, to study the association between costimulation, PTEN, and 
NFAT5 signaling with Treg induction, we used naïve CD4+ T cells 
from PTEN transgenic (Tg) animals (35), which harbor constitutively 
increased PTEN expression and reduced PI3K activation. High PTEN 
expression significantly enhanced Treg induction compared to WT 
T cells (P < 0.01) (Fig. 5, F and G). The increased Treg induction from 
PTEN Tg animals was accompanied by reduced Nfat5 expression, 
enhanced Foxo1 expression in CD4+ T cells ex vivo (fig. S12, A and 
B), and lower Nfat5 expression after TCR stimulation (Fig. 5H). An 
miRNA181a mimic reduced, whereas an miRNA181a antagomir en-
hanced, Treg induction and inhibited NFAT5 expression using naïve 
CD4+ T cells from PTEN Tg animals also with subimmunogenic TCR 
stimulation (figs. S12, C and D, and S13, A and B).
Enhancement of Treg induction by a specific NFAT5 inhibitor
Therapeutic agents that can specifically inhibit NFAT5 have been 
lacking until now. A recently identified compound was shown to block 
the proinflammatory NFAT5 activity by inhibiting Nfat5 transcrip-
tional activation without affecting NFAT1 to NFAT4, nuclear fac-
tor B (NF-B), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and cAMP

atopoietic cells or tissues, do develop a human immune system with a 
highly diverse TCR repertoire. These mice permit the assessment of 
human T cell responses in vivo. Here, we made use of the murine 
MHCII (major histocompatibility complex class II)–deficient, HLA-
DQ8 Tg NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl (NSG) mouse model (12).
Amelioration of murine islet autoimmunity by an 
miRNA181a antagomir or an NFAT5 inhibitor in vivo
Next, we tested the impact of blocking miRNA181a to modulate islet 
autoimmunity in IAA+NOD mice in the absence of symptomatic T1D 
in vivo. The miRNA181a antagomir [10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (ip)] 
every other day for 14 days enhanced FoxP3+ Tregs in the peripheral 
blood (Fig. 7, A to C). The fact that the Treg enhancement was signifi-
cant in peripheral blood (P < 0.01) but not in the lymph nodes suggests 
that a further miRNA181a antagomir dose titration might be needed 
and/or a daily application.
Blocking miRNA181a significantly enhanced ex vivo PTEN expres-
sion in CD4+ T cells from the lymph nodes of IAA+NOD mice (P < 0.05) 
(fig. S15, A and B) while significantly reducing CD28 expression (P < 
0.001) (Fig. 7, D and E) and lowering IAA levels (P < 0.01) (fig. S15C). 
The amelioration of autoimmune activation was verified by histo-
pathological and immunofluorescence analyses of pancreatic sections, 
which showed a reduction in T cell infiltration (Fig. 7, F to G, and 
fig. S15D).
Applying an NFAT5 inhibitor to IAA+NOD mice at 3 mg/kg ip 
every day for 14 days significantly enhanced FoxP3+ Tregs in lymph 
nodes (P < 0.001) (Fig. 7, H and I) and reduced pancreatic immune 
infiltration (Fig. 7, J and K, and fig. S15F). In addition, NFAT5 inhi-
bition distinctly reduced NFAT5 expression in pancreas-infiltrating 
T cells from IAA+NOD mice (Fig. 8, A and B, and fig. S15G). Block-
ing NFAT5 did not cause any changes in metabolic parameters (for 
example, body mass and blood glucose; Fig. 8, C and D).
DISCUSSION
A better understanding of the molecular underpinnings affecting im-
mune tolerance defects is pivotal to develop personalized medicines 
that limit autoimmune progression. Highly variable progression from 
islet autoimmunity to clinical T1D (3) underscores plasticity in regu-
lating immune activation versus tolerance. Therefore, T cells from non-
diabetic children with ongoing islet autoimmunity offer a valuable 
resource for studying signaling pathways involved in this plasticity.
An important weakness of this study is that no longitudinal samples 
from individual children have been available to assess and integrate Treg 
induction potential from naïve CD4+ T cells in accordance with the 
duration of islet autoimmunity over time. Therefore and given the dif-
ferences in the median age within respective disease groups, within the 
present human data set, a confounding role of age per se in influencing 
Treg induction potential from naïve CD4+ T cells cannot be excluded.
Here, we provide evidence for a broad Treg induction impairment 
during islet autoimmunity onset. Consistent with the reduced Treg induc-
tion potential, proliferation and frequencies of FOXP3intCD4+ T cells 
were enhanced, indicative of T cell activation, thereby limiting possibilities 
of subimmunogenic stimulation necessary for efficient FOXP3+ Treg in-
duction (7, 11, 24).
By contrast, with naïve CD4+ T cells from nondiabetic children with 
long-term autoimmunity, the Treg induction potential was restored 
to frequency observed in children without autoimmunity, thereby sug-
gesting that children with long-term autoimmunity might have regu-
lated autoimmune activation or might at least be in a transient state of

immune tolerance. Accordingly, children with long-term autoimmu-
nity phenotypes show an accumulation of protective genotypes in T1D 
susceptibility genes (37), most notably, IL-2, IL2-R, INS VNTR, and 
IL-10. In line, such children with long-term autoimmunity harbored 
TFH precursor cell frequencies as low as autoantibody-negative chil-
dren (13), accompanied by an increase in insulin-specific Tregs (12).
As one possible means to explain this Treg induction impairment, 
we identified enhanced miRNA181a abundance in CD4+ T cells during 
islet autoimmunity onset. Murine miRNA181a regulates signal strength 
of stimulation by modulating the sensitivity to antigenic stimulation 
and signaling thresholds in CD4+ T cells during thymic T cell devel-
opment (25). These properties of miRNA181a suggest that an in-
creased sensitivity to antigenic stimulation boosts T cell activation, 
thereby promoting islet autoimmunity and antagonizing Treg induc-
tion. Accordingly, an miRNA181a mimic distinctly impeded, whereas 
an miRNA181a antagomir enhanced, human and murine Treg induc-
tion. The miRNA181a- 
mediated enhancement of signal strength of 
stimulation also involves the suppression of negative regulators of 
T cell activation such as the phosphatase PTEN. PTEN functions as a 
key signaling intermediate controlling the activation of PI3K. Con-
sequently, miRNA181a-mediated PTEN inhibition promotes PI3K sig-
naling, which, in turn, can contribute to NFAT5 activation (23). Therefore, 
blockade of PTEN signaling by miRNA181a might function as one 
possible mechanism of indirect regulation to boost NFAT5 expression. 
Accordingly, in CD4+ T cells from children with ongoing islet auto-
immunity, we find enhanced miRNA181a abundance, together with

a decrease in Pten and an increase in Nfat5 expression. Moreover, upon 
miRNA181a blockade in IAA+NOD mice, we identify increased PTEN 
expression in CD4+ T cells, accompanied by reduced NFAT5 expression .
Furthermore, the observed NFAT5 induction by miRNA181a might 
also result from additional indirect control of repression pathways 
and/or potentially involve relief of miRNA181a-mediated repression 
of NFAT5 (17, 38). In addition, the increase in signal strength of stim-
ulation induced by miRNA181a includes an enhancement of costim-
ulatory signals such as CD28 (25). Specifically, increased miRNA181a 
levels promoted CD28 expression while reducing CTLA4 surface 
expression. CD28 signaling triggers PI3K signaling (11), which can 
contribute to NFAT5 activation (23), thereby offering a potential ad-
ditional explanation on how miRNA181a might indirectly contribute 
to NFAT5 up-regulation. Accordingly, we observe enhanced CD28

In the absence of NFAT5, Treg induction was enhanced, T cells 
harbored increased Pten and Foxo1 expression, both critically in-

activity inactivates Foxo1 proteins by excluding them from the nu-
cleus (39).
These results suggest that a low activity of an miRNA181a-NFAT5 
signaling axis can link improved FOXP3 inducibility with limited 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation. Accordingly, PTEN-deficient T cells 
showed a constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling 
pathway, accompanied by impaired FoxP3+ Treg induction, which 
was restored by PI3K inhibition.
In summary, here, we show that an miRNA181a/NFAT5 axis critically 
contributes to an impairment of Treg induction during islet auto 
immunity. 
These findings suggest that targeting miRNA181a and/or NFAT5 signal-
ing could contribute to the development of translational strategies 
aimed at inhibiting the signaling intermediates of T cell activation to 
limit T1D islet autoimmunity while improving Treg induction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This study was designed to investigate Treg induction in T cells from 
children at an early state of islet autoimmunity without symptomatic 
T1D. Therefore, peripheral blood from children who are first-degree 
relatives of T1D patients that consented to the Munich Bioresource 
project was analyzed. Treg induction during different phases of islet 
autoimmunity was assessed. T cell–specific miRNAs and miRNA- 
regulated pathways involved in Treg induction were studied using NGS 
and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses. Treg in-
duction and autoimmune modulation upon miRNA181a or NFAT5 
blockade were analyzed in NOD mice and in humanized NSG mice. 
Specifically, we focused on miRNA181a because of its implication in 
mediating signal strength of antigenic stimulation and on the role of 
Nfat5 in interfering with Treg induction. We performed loss- and gain- 
of-function studies using NFAT5ko animals and PTEN-overexpressing 
mice to assess the role of an miRNA181a/NFAT5 axis in Treg induc-
tion. NOD mice were monitored for weight changes, blood glucose 
levels, and clinical signs throughout the experiment. The investigators 
were not blinded, and no animals were excluded because of illness. 
Primary data are located in table S1.
Human subjects and blood samples
Blood samples were collected from children or adults who are first 
degree relatives of T1D patients and who consented to the Munich 
Bioresource project (approval no. 5049/11, Technische Universität 
München, Munich, Germany). All subjects have been already enrolled 
into longitudinal studies with prospective follow-up from birth (40–42) 
with the documented age of islet autoantibody seroconversion (initia-
tion of islet autoimmunity). Venous blood was collected using sodium 
heparin tubes, and blood volumes collected were based on European 
Union  guidelines, with a maximal blood volume of 2.4 ml/kg of body 
weight. Subjects have been stratified on the basis of the presence or 
absence of multiple islet autoantibodies (with or without pre-T1D) 
and on the basis of the duration of islet autoantibody positivity. De-
tails on included subjects can be found in the Supplementary Materials. 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by den-
sity centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare). Human 
dendritic cells (DCs) were purified to >90% purity from autologous 
PBMC samples using the Blood DC Isolation kit II human (Miltenyi 
Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Human CD4+ 
T cells were isolated at a purity of >90% from fresh PBMCs via pos-
itive magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) enrichment, using CD4 
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec).

Mice
Female NOD/ShiLtJ mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory 
and stratified according to their IAA status (IAA+NOD mice: median 
age, 118 days; interquartile range (IQR), 74 to 134 days; IAA−NOD 
mice: 99 days; IQR, 51 to 120 days). Analyses of murine IAAs were 
carried out from serum, as described previously using a mouse high- 
specificity/sensitivity competitive IAA assay in an enzyme-linked im-
munosorbent assay format (43) or a protein A/G radiobinding assay 
(42). For more details, see the Supplementary Materials. NFAT5ko 
mice were provided by C. Küper. PTEN Tg mice were provided by 
M. Serrano. AKAP13 (Brx) haploinsufficient mice were received from 
J. Segars. NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid H2-Ab1tm1Gru Il2rgtm1Wjl Tg(HLA-DQA1, 
HLA-DQB1)1Dv//Sz (NSG HLA-DQ8) mice were developed by 
L. Shultz at the Jackson Laboratory. Ethical approval for all mouse 
experimentations has been received by the District Government of 
Upper Bavaria, Munich, Germany. No animals were excluded because 
of illness or outlier results; therefore, no exclusion determination was 
required. Further information on ko and Tg mouse lines can be found in 
the Supplementary Materials. CD4+ T cells were isolated at >90% pu-
rity by positive MACS enrichment using CD4 Biotin (BD Biosciences) 
and streptavidin microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec).
Treg induction using subimmunogenic TCR  
stimulation in vitro
Polyclonal TCR stimulation
Naïve CD4+ T cells were defined as CD3+CD4+CD45RA+CD45RO− 
CD127+CD25− (human) or as CD4+CD25−CD44− (murine) and sorted 
with the BD FACS Aria III at a purity of >95%. A total of 10,000 (mu-
rine assays) or 100,000 (human assays) naïve CD4+ T cells per well were 
cultured for 18 hours in 96-well plates precoated with anti-CD3 and 
anti-CD28 antibodies (5 g/ml, unless indicated otherwise). Sub-
immunogenic TCR stimulation was achieved by pipetting cells into 
uncoated wells, after 18 hours, where they were cultured for an addi-
tional 36 hours.
Insulin-specific TCR stimulation
Human naïve CD4+ T cells were sorted as described above and cul-
tured at 500,000 per well in 96-well plates precoated with streptavidin 
and HLA-DQ8 (5 g/ml) monomers in complex with either insulin 
mimetopes or control peptides (for information on peptides, see the 
Supplementary Materials). Anti-CD28 (50 ng/ml) was added to the 
medium. Subimmunogenic TCR stimulation was achieved by chang-
ing the medium and pipetting the cells into uncoated wells after 12 hours. 
Analysis was performed after an additional 36 hours. The insulin spec-
ificity of T cell responses has been verified previously using HLA-DQ8– 
restricted insulin-specific tetramers and control tetramers fused to 
irrelevant peptides (12), sort purification of tetramer+ T cells, and 
insulin-specific restimulation (12).
DC-dependent Treg induction
A total of 500,000 human naïve CD4+ T cells per well were cocultured 
with autologous carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)– 
labeled DCs at a ratio of 100:1 in the presence of a human HA epitope. 
After 12 hours, antigen-presenting cells were removed, and CD4+ 
T cells were sorted as CFSE−, followed by a culture for an additional 
36 hours in new wells, without further peptide stimulation. Informa-
tion on peptides can be found in the Supplementary Materials.
CFSE T cell proliferation assays
CD4+CD25− T cells were labeled with CFSE (0.25 M) and propa-
gated with aAPCs for 5 days. Information on aAPCs is in the Sup-
plementary Materials. After 5 days, cells were analyzed by FACS 
(fluorescence-activated cell sorting). Responsiveness was measured 
by the presence and quantity of CD4+CD25+CFSEdim T cells.
Isolation and processing of miRNAs and mRNAs
For the isolation of miRNAs and mRNAs, the miRNeasy Micro kit 
(Qiagen) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA 
concentration and purity were determined by a NanoDrop (Epoch, 
Biotek) or an RNA Nano Chip and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent 
Technologies). For complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis, the Uni-
versal cDNA Synthesis kit II (for miRNAs; Exiqon) or the iScript 
cDNA Synthesis kit (for mRNAs; Bio-Rad) was used according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was performed using the ExiLENT 
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (for miRNAs; Exiqon) or the SsoFast 
EvaGreen Supermix (for mRNAs; Bio-Rad) and a CFX96 Real-Time 
System (Bio-Rad). Information on primers can be found in the Sup-
plementary Materials.
miRNA/mRNA expression profiling
We used NGS for expression profiling in a test set of each four 
pooled samples of naïve versus activated CD4+ T cells purified from 
children with or without ongoing islet autoimmunity. cDNA libraries 
for miRNA and mRNA sequencing were transcribed from total 
RNA using the NEBnext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set and 
NEBnext mRNA Library Prep Master Mix (New England Biolabs), 
and mRNA library preparation was conducted with TruSeq RNA 
Sample Preparation kit v2 (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s 
instruction. NGS was performed on a HiSeq2000 (Illumina), with 
50–base pair single-end reads for small RNA and mRNA using Illumina 
reagents and following the manufacturer’s instruction. Information 
on data processing and statistical analysis can be found in the Sup-
plementary Materials.
Application of miR181a antagomir or mimic to human 
and murine CD4+ T cells
Chitosan-coated PLGA nanoparticles (for information on nanopar-
ticle preparation, characterization, and testing, refer to the Supple-
mentary Materials) were loaded with an miR181a-5p inhibitor 
(miRCURY LNA microRNA inhibitor, Exiqon) or an miR181a-5p 
mimic (miRCURY LNA microRNA mimic, Exiqon) at a nanoparticle 
to inhibitor/mimic ratio of 50:1 and incubated at room temperature 
for 30 min, with gentle agitation (sequences can be found in the 
Supplementary Materials). The loaded nanoparticles were added to 
the wells of a polyclonal Treg induction assay at a final concentration 
of 0.95 ng/l per 100,000 cells for human cells and 0.19 ng/l per 
10,000 cells for murine cells (for miR181a inhibitor) and 2.1 ng/l 
per 100,000 cells for human assays and 0.21 ng/l per 10,000 cells 
for murine assays (for miR181a-5p mimic). As a control, a negative 
control mimic or inhibitor with no known targets was used at the 
same concentration.
Application of PI3K, PTEN, and NFAT5 inhibitors
The PTEN inhibitor SF1670 (Abcam) was added at a concentration 
of 0.5 M directly with the start of the stimulation of naïve CD4+ 
T cells, and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (final concentration, 10 M; 
SYNkinase) was added after 18 hours of TCR stimulation. A small- 
molecule inhibitor of NFAT5, developed by W.-U.K. (36), was added 
simultaneously to the TCR stimulation at a concentration of 0.01 M 
or 0.01 nM in case of low-dose anti-CD3 stimulation.

In vivo NFAT5 inhibition and miRNA181a antagomir 
application
For assessment of in vivo NFAT5 inhibition, IAA+NOD mice or 
human immune system–engrafted NSG HLA-DQ8 mice (12) were 
injected intraperitoneally with NFAT5 inhibitor (3 mg/kg) once daily 
for 14 days (NOD mice) or 4 days (NSG mice). An miRNA181a 
antagomir (inhibitor probe mmu-miR-181a-5p, Exiqon) was injected 
intraperitoneally into IAA+NOD mice at 10 mg/kg every other day 
for 14 days. Control mice were injected with sodium chloride. On day 
15 or 5, Treg frequencies were analyzed in the peripheral blood and 
pancreatic lymph nodes (NOD mice) or in the peripheral blood and 
spleen (NSG HLA-DQ8 mice). Pancreata of NOD mice were embedded 
for cryosections and analysis of pancreas pathology.
Histopathology of NOD pancreata
Pancreata were embedded with Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound and fro-
zen on dry ice, and serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and 
eosin. Insulitis scoring was performed as previously described (44, 45). 
The following scores were assigned: 0, intact islets/no lesions; 1, periislet 
infiltrates; 2, <25% islet destruction; 3, >25% islet destruction; 4, complete 
islet destruction. Investigators were blinded for group allocations.
Immunofluorsecence staining of NOD pancreata
Immunofluorescence staining was carried out using rabbit anti- 
mouse insulin antibodies (Cell Signaling) and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 
Fluor 647 antibodies (Dianova). For CD4 staining, rat anti-mouse (Becton, 
Dickinson and Company) antibodies were used, followed by goat anti- 
rat Alexa Fluor 488 (Dianova). For NFAT5, staining a rabbit anti- 
mNFAT5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. For FoxP3 staining, 
cells were incubated with rat anti-mouse antibodies (eBioscience) and 
goat anti-rabbit (Becton, Dickinson and Company), combined with TSA 
Cyanine 3 amplification (PerkinElmer). Nuclei were counterstained 
with Hoechst 33342 dye (Invitrogen). Negative control slides were in-
cubated with secondary antibodies. Cells were analyzed by confocal 
microscopy (Olympus).
Statistics
Results are presented as mean and SEM or as percentages, where 
appropriate, or as box and whisker plots with minimum to maxi-
mum values for data distribution. For normally distributed data, 
Student’s t test for unpaired values was used to compare means be-
tween independent groups, and the Student’s t test for paired values 
was used to compare values for the same sample or subject tested 
under different conditions. The nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test was applied when data did not show Gaussian distribution. Group 
size estimations were based on a power calculation to minimally yield 
an 80% chance to detect a significant difference in the respective pa-
rameter of P < 0.05 between the relevant groups. For all tests, a two-
tailed P value of <0.05 was considered to be significant. Statistical 
significance is shown as *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, or not sig-
nificant (ns) P > 0.05. Analyses were performed using the programs 
GraphPad Prism 6 and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 
(SPSS version 19.0, SPSS Inc.).
