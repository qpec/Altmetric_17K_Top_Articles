Abstract
Objective: The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) QLQ-C30 health-related quality of life questionnaire is one of the most widely used
cancer-specific health-related quality of life questionnaires worldwide. General population
norm data can facilitate the interpretation of QLQ-C30 data obtained from cancer patients.
This study aimed at systematically collecting norm data from the general population to
develop European QLQ-C30 norm scores and to generate comparable norm data for individ-
ual countries in Europe and North America.
Methods: We collected QLQ-C30 data from the general population across 11 European Union
(EU) countries, Russia, Turkey, Canada and United States (n � 1000/country). Representa-
tive samples were stratified by sex and age groups (18e39, 40e49, 50e59, 60e69 and � 70
years). After applying weights based on the United Nations population distribution statistics,
we calculated QLQ-C30 domain scores to generate a ‘European QLQ-C30 Norm’ based on the
EU countries. Further, we calculated QLQ-C30 norm scores for all 15 individual countries.
Results: A total of 15,386 respondents completed the online survey. For the EU sample, most
QLQ-C30 domains showed differences by sex/age, with men scoring somewhat better health
than women, while age effects varied across domains. Substantially larger differences were
seen in inter-country comparisons, with Austrian and Dutch respondents reporting consis-
tently better health compared with British and Polish respondents.
Conclusions: This study is the first to systematically collect EORTC QLQ-C30 general popu-
lation norm data across Europe and North America applying a consistent data collection
method across 15 countries. These new norm data facilitate valid intra-country as well as in-
ter-country comparisons and QLQ-C30 score interpretation.

1. Introduction
The importance of including the patients’ voice in clin-
ical practice and research has been recognised widely for
several decades [1,2]. In more recent years, patient-
reported outcomes (PROs) have also been increasingly
acknowledged in drug development and regulatory
decision-making [3e5]. Given this growing relevance of
PROs, it is not surprising that efforts are undertaken to
standardise PRO data, with several initiatives worldwide
tackling the issue in different ways. One possible
approachdas taken by the International Consortium
for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM)dis to
define standard sets of existing PRO instruments to
enable comparison of outcomes across health-care pro-
viders and geographies [6]. A more elaborate approach
is to measure PROs by applying modern test theory
methods
where
items
measuring
the
same
latent
construct are calibrated on the same metric. This serves
as the foundation of the application of computer-
adaptive tests (CATs) [7e9].
The
European
Organisation
for
Research
and
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group
(QLG) has a long track record of developing and vali-
dating PRO instruments for use in oncology. Their
quality of life (QoL) core questionnaire, the QLQ-C30,
was developed more than 25 years ago and is one of the
most widely used cancer-specific PRO instruments
[10,11]. Regarding standardisation, use of the QLQ-C30
as part of clinical routine is frequently recommended in
ICHOM standard sets for malignant neoplasms (e.g.
[12,13]). Further, the EORTC QLG developed a QLQ-
C30
CAT
version,
the
EORTC
CAT
Core
[8].
Through tailoring items to the individual respondent,
CATs can achieve the same measurement precision as
static instruments while using fewer items; CATs also
minimise floor/ceiling effects [14].
While
these
initiatives
are
crucial
steps
toward improving quality and comparability of PRO
data, data analysis and interpretation is further enhanced
by using a sensible reference for comparative purposes.
Depending on the objective of such comparison, a useful
reference can be data obtained from cancer patients or
norm data collected from the general population. If these
data are not available, interpretation of PRO data may
be arbitrary. For the comparison of QLQ-C30 scores
with cancer-patient data, the EORTC QLG has pub-
lished reference values generated for various cancer
populations [15]. In addition, general population norm
data have been collected in different countries over the
last two decades, with European data available for
Denmark [16,17], Germany [18e20], the Netherlands
[21,22], Norway [23,24], Slovenia [25] and Sweden
[26,27], with the latest German publication providing a
European norm by collating data from different samples
[20]. However, a major drawback of this work is that
inter-country comparisons are hampered because of the
lack of a common sampling methodology across studies.

 Given the dearth of research regarding European
QLQ-C30 general population norm data for use in inter-
country comparisons, the EORTC QLG set out to sys-
tematically collect general population data in 13 Euro-
pean countries, Canada and the United States using a
common methodology to generate norm data for the
QLQ-C30 and the CAT Core [8]. This article presents
European QLQ-C30 general population norm data and
individual country norms for 15 countries.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Country selection
Country
selection
was
based
on
several
criteria,
including population size and balance of geographical
location, whilst considering budgetary constraints. The
final selection included 11 European Union (EU)
countries
(Austria,
Denmark,
France,
Germany,
Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden
and United Kingdom). For comparative purposes, we
also collected data in Russia, Turkey, Canada and the
United States.
2.2. Item selection and sociodemographic data
The QLQ-C30 consists of 30 items covering five function
subscales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and so-
cial), nine symptom subscales/items (fatigue, nausea/
vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, con-
stipation, diarrhoea and financial difficulties) and a
global health/QoL subscale. Further details of the full-
scale survey are reported elsewhere [41]. A range of
sociodemographic data were collected, including sex,
age, education, employment, relationship status and
presence of health conditions.
2.3. Translation and cultural adaptation of included
variables
All QLQ-C30 items were available for the languages
spoken in the selected countries. In contrast, the socio-
demographic variables had to be developed and trans-
lated. During this process, assessment of educational
attainment proved to be challenging. After a compre-
hensive consensus process, including review of the In-
ternational Standard Classification of Education (2011),
the final categorisation was deemed adequate by the
study collaborators.
2.4. Sampling
To generate sufficiently large sample sizes for estimating
stable norms for a range of subgroups, we stratified
samples by sex and age group (18e39, 40e49, 50e59,
60e69 and � 70 years) with sample sizes of n Z 100/
stratum, i.e. n Z 1000/country. Sampling of an equal
distribution of sex and age groups provides norm data
for purposes of comparing cancer-patient data with sex-
and age-matched peers from the general population.
Further details regarding the rationale for the sample
size are reported elsewhere [41].
2.5. Data collection
To ensure a consistent data collection method and
representative samples throughout, we subcontracted
data collection to GfK SE (www.gfk.com), a panel
research
company
experienced
in
multinational/
multilanguage online surveys. These internet panels are
representative for the general population (with internet
access) in a given country in terms of sex, age, region,
hometown size, household size and socioeconomic
status. While GfK achieved most quotas via internet
panels, n Z 290 respondents (� 60 years) provided
data via computer-assisted telephone interviews to ach-
ieve quotas in Turkey.
Data were collected in March/April 2017. As GfK
panel members are registered voluntarily and generally
participate when contacted, GfK attains response rates
between 75 and 90%.
2.6. Establishing European norm data for the EORTC
QLQ-C30
For the final definition of the ‘European QLQ-C30
Norm’, we included the 11 EU countries. We weighted
data by respective country’s population size, sex and age
distribution based on official 2015 population distribu-
tion statistics published by the United Nations [28].
2.7. Statistical analyses
We calculated mean scores and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) of the QLQ-C30 subscales ranging between 0 and
100 following the QLQ-C30 scoring manual [29]. We
calculated norm scores for the sex/age strata of the
combined EU sample weighted by country size and sex/
age distribution. Given the large samples, we further
divided the youngest age group into 18e29 and 30e39
years, respectively. Finally, we calculated national norm
data for all 15 countries, weighted by respective coun-
try’s sex/age distribution. For all analyses, we used IBM
SPSS Statistics�, version 25.
3. Results
Stratified quotas were achieved in all 15 countries, with
n � 100 individuals completing the survey in each
sex*age*country subgroup. Country sample sizes ranged
between n Z 1000 (the Netherlands) and n Z 1165
(Spain), leading to a final sample size of N Z 15,386 for
the full and n Z 11,343 for the EU sample (Table 1).

 Sociodemographic characteristics of the two samples
were comparable. As per sampling, there was an equal
distribution of females/males and age groups. Re-
spondents’ age ranged between 18 and 99 years, with
mean age 53.6 years. Around 90% of respondents indi-
cated to have at least some post-compulsory education.
Across samples, 36% of respondents were working full-
time; 34% were retired. About two-thirds reported being
married/in a steady relationship. Finally, the most
frequently reported diseases were chronic pain, arthritis,
diabetes, obesity and depression, with 63% (full sample)
and 61% (EU sample), respectively, reporting to have at
least one health condition (Table 1).
As shown in Table 2, self-rated function in our EU
sample was relatively high. Across subscales, sample
mean scores ranged between 84.3 and 86.2 (on a 100-
point scale), with 95% CIs between �0.50 and � 0.65.
The only exception was emotional function, with a mean
score of 74.2 (95% CI, �0.66). Women and men rated
themselves similarly, except for emotional function
where men rated themselves 4.7 points higher than
women. Age effects varied. For physical and role func-
tion,
women
reported
decreasing
function
with
increasing age; men did not show age differences. For
the remaining function subscales, age effects tended to
be in the opposite direction, with older respondents
reporting higher function than younger respondents.
For some symptom subscales, marked floor effects were
observed, with > 80% selecting the lowest/best score for
nausea/vomiting, appetite loss, diarrhoea and financial
difficulties. Scores ranged between 5.9 (nausea/vomiting)
and 29.5 (fatigue), with 95% CIs between �0.48
and � 0.79. Men tended to rate themselves lower/better
than women, with largest differences observed for
insomnia, fatigue and pain. Age effects varied. For pain
and dyspnoea, women reported more symptoms with
increasing age. In contrast, for fatigue, nausea/vomiting
and appetite loss, older respondents tended to score
lower/better than younger respondents; for diarrhoea
and financial difficulties, this age effect was only seen in
men. For global health/QoL, men reported higher scores
than women (68.0 for men, 95% CI, �0.81; 64.3 for
women, 95% CI, �0.74). Respondents aged 50e59 years
reported lowest global health/QoL scores (65.8 for men;
62.6 for women; 95% CI, �1.63 each).
Compared with differences between sex/age groups,
inter-country comparisons suggest larger group differ-
ences (Table 3, Fig. 1 and 2). Austrian and Dutch re-
spondents reported the best scores, i.e. highest for
function and lowest for symptoms. In contrast, Polish
and British respondents for the EU sample and Russian,
Turkish and United States respondents for the full
sample regularly reported worse scores, with differences
reaching or exceeding 10 points, a difference that is
often applied to indicate clinical relevance [30]. On the
global health/QoL subscale, differences between lowest
(Poland, Russia, Turkey and United Kingdom) and
highest scoring nations (Austria and Netherlands) again
exceeded 10 points.
4. Discussion
This study is the first to systematically collect European
and individual country general population norm data
for the EORTC QLQ-C30 using consistent data collec-
tion methods across 15 countries in Europe and North
America. The ‘European QLQ-C30 Norm’ enables valid
inter-country comparisons for cancer-patient data. Data
from cancer patients can be compared with sex-/age-
matched peers from the general population. In addition,
the country-specific norm data for 15 countries, espe-
cially for those where no QLQ-C30 norm data yet
existed, can be used for country-level comparisons.

a For the calculation of percentage distributions, the category “prefer not to answer” is treated as missing data.
b The sample sizes were reduced by n Z 114 (0.7%) in the full sample and n Z 79 (0.7%) in the EU subsample, respectively, as respondents had
provided implausible data to the question on presence of disease.
c The sum of health conditions is larger than the total sample of N Z 15,386 (full sample) and n Z 11,343 (EU subsample), respectively, as
respondents were able to check multiple response options.

 To generate these norm data, we subcontracted data
collection via online surveys to a panel research com-
pany (GfK). Such internet panels are an efficient and
cost-effective method to generate norm data, and there
is evidence from a comparable study carried out in the
context of the United States Patient-Reported Outcomes
Measurement Information System (PROMIS) initiative
that data are representative of the general population
provided that scores are weighted [31], which is consis-
tent with the methods we applied. As 15 individual
samples, however, are more heterogenous compared
with
aforementioned
single-country
survey,

 compared our sample characteristics with official pop-
ulation statistics where available. For example, in our
EU sample, 6.8% of respondents indicated that they
were unemployed (weighted data, not shown), which
matches the official 2017 EU unemployment rate of
6.7% for individuals older than 25 years [32]. Further,
64.4% of respondents reported being married/in a steady
relationship, which is slightly higher than the EU

 average of 59.3% [33]. Finally, self-reported prevalence
of several health conditions is largely in-line with prev-
alence rates published in the literature [34e36]. In
contrast,
individuals
with
lower
educational
levels
appear underrepresented in our EU sample, with around
90% reporting at least some post-compulsory education.
This is generally lower than in most European countries;
however,
percentage
distribution
varies
widely
by
country [37].
Some observed subgroup and country differences
warrant further discussion. For example, in emotional
function, several symptom subscales and overall QoL,
men reported somewhat better scores than women, a
finding also observed in other QLQ-C30 norm data
studies [20]. Further, in some instances, older re-
spondents reported remarkably high function. For
physical function, further subgroup analyses within our
oldest age group suggest that decline in self-reported

 physical function occurs primarily from � 80 years (data
not shown). Unfortunately, we did not have sufficient
numbers in this age group, as our oldest stratified age
group was � 70 years. Also, older respondents’ self-
reported cognitive function appears high. This finding
may be explained by people adjusting health expecta-
tions with increasing age. Research also suggests that
older persons value different factors compared with
younger persons when assessing their health and that
younger persons’ health perceptions are more affected
by health limitations than those of older persons [38].
Additionally, given that in the oldest age group, over
90% were retired, everyday demands on cognitive
function may be lower than that of younger re-
spondents, especially those in the workforce. Hence, the
construct we are trying to measure may differ depending
on respondents’ age. The high cognitive function re-
ported by older respondents may also reflect some de-
gree of selection bias, given that respondents had to
have internet access and some computer skills. Finally,
several reasons might explain the observed country dif-
ferences. It is conceivable that items and/or response
scales have different meanings in different cultures;
however, given EORTC’s long-standing experience with
translations/linguistic validations, it is unlikely that this
explains observed differences [39]. It is more likely that
differences are indeed true differences between countries
and that factors such as the welfare state characteristic
[40] play a role in people’s self-reported health.
This study has several limitations that should be
noted. First, as indicated above, targeting older age
groups, i.e. � 80 years, could provide further insight into
changes in QoL as a consequence of aging. It was beyond
the scope of our study to collect these data as costs are
disproportionately high because of the need to often
conduct personal/telephone interviews instead of online
surveys in older age groups. Second, we observed marked
floor effects for several symptoms. Such effects are un-
avoidable when data are obtained from the general (i.e.
relatively healthy) population, especially if fixed-length
questionnaires, including some single-item subscales, are
used. One possible solution to reduce floor/ceiling effects
is the use of CAT such as the EORTC CAT Core [8].
Finally, while our norm data are assumed to be repre-
sentative of the general population, our sample was
relatively highly educated. In our EORTC CAT Core
norm data article [41], we explore the influence of
educational level on scores. While significant differences
were found, with more highly educated respondents
reporting better health, the practical relevance of these
differences was very small as indicated by small effect
sizes. Also, it was difficult to harmonise educational
levels across countries; hence, it is plausible that ‘post-
compulsory’ has different meanings in different coun-
tries. Despite all of these limitations, online surveys
represent an efficient, cost-effective method of obtaining
large, representative general population samples. While it
comes with disadvantages such as difficulty with reaching
older age groups, as seen with the Turkish sample, there
are many convincing advantages to this method over
personal and telephone interviews (e.g. higher response
rates and avoidance of interviewer bias). With the
steadily increasing use of the internet in recent years, this
method is gaining in popularity [31]. Using internet
panels, we were able to obtain a large sample of
N Z 15,386 persons generating norm data for 15 coun-
tries, thereby providing a valuable resource for studies
using the QLQ-C30. These general population norm
scores are robust, even for stratified analyses, as is evi-
denced by the generally very small 95% CIs.
5. Conclusions
This study generated European (and North American)
and individual country norm data for the EORTC
QLQ-C30 based on a common sampling strategy and
survey design. We recommend that the ‘European QLQ-
C30 Norm’ be used to compare self-reported health-
related quality of life of cancer patients with general
population data, especially in multinational projects.
Ethical statement
Ethical approval was not sought as this study is solely
based on panel research data. As opposed to medical
research where medical professional codes of conduct
apply,
there
is
widespread
agreement
that
health
research involving volunteers from the general popula-
tion is not subject to ethical approval. Both the Euro-
pean
Pharmaceutical
Market
Research Association
(EphMRA) and the NHS Health Research Authority
specify that this type of research does not require ethical
approval as long as the research conforms to ethical
guidelines. Our online survey was carried out by the
panel research company GfK SE which is member of
EphMRA. The multinational survey conformed to the
required ethical standards by obtaining informed con-
sent from all participants and collecting data completely
anonymously. Any identification of the respondents
through the authors is impossible.
