ABSTRACT
Background: Administrators of Emergency Medical Ser-
vices (EMS) operations lack guidance on how to mitigate
workplace fatigue, which affects greater than half of all EMS
personnel. The primary objective of the Fatigue in EMS
Project was to create an evidence-based guideline for fatigue
risk management tailored to EMS operations. Methods:
Systematic searches were conducted from 1980 to Septem-
ber 2016 and guided by seven research questions framed
in the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome
(PICO) framework. Teams of investigators applied inclusion
criteria, which included limiting the retained literature to
EMS personnel or similar shift worker groups. The expert
panel reviewed summaries of the evidence based on the
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development
and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The panel evaluated
the quality of evidence for each PICO question separately,
considered the balance between benefits and harms, con-
sidered the values and preferences of the targeted popula-
tion, and evaluated the resource requirements/needs. The
GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) Framework was used
to prepare draft recommendations based on the evidence,
and the Content Validity Index (CVI) was used to quan-
tify the panel’
s agreement on the relevance and clarity of
each recommendation. CVI scores for relevance and clar-
ity were measured separately on a 1–4 scale to indicate
consensus/agreement among panel members and conclu-
sion of recommendation development. Results: The EtD
framework was applied to all 7 PICO questions, and the
panel created 5 recommendations. PICO1: The panel recom-
mends using fatigue/sleepiness survey instruments to mea-
sure and monitor fatigue in EMS personnel. PICO2: The panel
recommends that EMS personnel work shifts shorter than
24 hours in duration. PICO3: The panel recommends that
EMS personnel have access to caffeine as a fatigue counter-
measure. PICO4: The panel recommends that, EMS person-
nel have the opportunity to nap while on duty to mitigate
fatigue. PICO5: The panel recommends that EMS person-
nel receive education and training to mitigate fatigue and
fatigue-related risks. The panel referenced insufficient evi-
dence as the reason for making no recommendation linked
to 2 PICO questions. Conclusions: Based on a review of the
evidence, the panel developed a guideline with 5 recom-
mendations for fatigue risk management in EMS operations.

BACKGROUND
Mental and physical fatigue in the Emergency Med-
ical Services (EMS) workplace affect large numbers
of EMS personnel (1) and have been linked to EMS
personnel injury, patient care error, and adverse events
(2). EMS personnel work in shifts, which has been
shown in other shift worker groups to disrupt normal
patterns of sleep and circadian rhythms, and contribute
to fatigue (3). The problem of fatigued EMS personnel
is widespread and not isolated to one type of EMS oper-
ation or category of EMS clinician (2, 4, 5). Administra-
tors of EMS organizations are not sufficiently equipped
to address fatigue in the workplace, in part because of
the absence of guidelines for fatigue risk management
in the EMS setting.
Fatigue risk management can be seen as one crit-
ical component of safety management systems and
is defined as “a scientifically based, data-driven
addition or alternative to prescriptive work hour
limitations, which manages employee fatigue in a flex-
ible manner appropriate to the level of risk exposure
and nature of the operation” (6). Aviation, rail, nuclear
power and other high-risk industries have aimed to
directly address the dangers of fatigue by developing
and applying advanced processes for fatigue detection
and mitigation (7). Despite this progress, none of these
industries has developed guidelines for fatigue risk
management based on a systematic review of the best
available evidence.
Evidence Based Guidelines (EBGs) help to normal-
ize practice and policies, and to aid decision-making
based on a review of the best available evidence. EBGs
are widely supported by national EMS and other
medical organizations (8, 9). Guideline development
is a multi-step process that requires careful review
of the evidence and consideration of factors that can
affect adoption and implementation of recommenda-
tions. The National Model Process was created to aid
EBG developers with developing, implementing, and
evaluating Prehospital EBGs (10). This Model Process
encourages the use of a rigorous methodology such as
the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Devel-
opment and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to form
recommendations based on a careful review of the
evidence and other factors that may impact acceptance
of an intervention by the target population (11).
This paper describes guideline development for the
Fatigue in EMS project and reports the results of the
panel’
s review of the evidence and recommendations.
This project was supported by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to address
gaps in guidance for fatigue risk management through
the Model Process and to aid the EMS industry with
recommendations tailored to EMS operations and per-
sonnel. The primary targeted audience for this work
includes individuals in positions of leadership, admin-
istration, and/or management of EMS personnel.

These recommendations should also guide the deci-
sion making of individuals in the position of educating,
training, and influencing policies that impact the work
environment, health, and safety of EMS personnel.
Fatigue risk management is a shared responsibility
between the employer and employee (6, 12). Therefore,
these recommendations are also meant to inform EMS
personnel, and to guide their decision-making toward
actions that can mitigate fatigue in the workplace.
METHODS
Overview
The development of these guidelines followed rec-
ommendations of the 8-step Model Process for the
creation of prehospital EBGs. The primary aim was
to create EBGs for fatigue risk management that are
tailored to the EMS workplace (10). External Input
(Step 1) was solicited through public comment periods
during project-related meetings in April 2016, and
with an online solicitation for public comments on a
designated project website. Guideline Initiation and
Evidence Review (Step 2) was accomplished by form-
ing a panel of experts with knowledge of and expe-
rience in sleep medicine, fatigue science, emergency
medicine, EMS, risk management, administration,
and consumerism (Table 1). The panel’
s configuration
satisfied the Institute of Medicine’
s (IOM) recom-
mendation of diversity in experience, expertise, and
content knowledge (8). Panel member disclosures
appear in Online Supplement Appendix A (13).
The panel produced seven research questions framed
in the Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Out-
comes (PICO) format. The development of each

Evidence
Appraisal (Step 3), which included seven systematic
reviews and where possible, meta-analyses (14–20).
All systematic reviews were registered with PROS-
PERO (21), the international database of prospec-
tively registered systematic reviews (2016 registra-
tion numbers: CRD42016040097; CRD42016040099;
CRD42016040101; CRD42016040107; CRD42016040110;
CRD42016040112; CRD42016040114). Evidence pro-
file tables were created as prescribed by the GRADE
system (11). Guideline Development (Step 4) focused
on evaluation of the evidence, panel discussions of
the balance between benefits and harms, appraisal of
the values and preferences of the target population,
and deliberation regarding the resources needed to
implement each intervention contained within the
PICOs.
Steps 5–8 comprise translating recommendations
into model protocols or policies, dissemination, imple-
mentation, and evaluation/testing (10). This paper
does not address Steps 5–8. This paper provides a sum-
mary of recommendations and their development, so
they may be disseminated, incorporated into policy,
and field-tested. The panel supplemented recommen-
dation statements with the panel’
s collective expert
opinion on interpretation of recommendations.
Protocol
The Institutional Review Board of the University of
Pittsburgh approved the protocol. In March and April
of 2017, the panel gathered for a face-to-face meeting
and a conference call/webinar to review the evidence
profiles for each PICO. The principal investigator
(PDP) and GRADE methodologist (ESL) led panel
members through an orderly review of GRADE evi-
dence profile tables for each research question. The
panel evaluated the quality of evidence, reflected on
the balance between benefits and harms of a particular
intervention, considered the values and preferences of
the targeted population, and evaluated the resource
requirements/needs associated with a particular inter-
vention. The discussions were documented with the
GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) Framework (22).
The EtD framework is a form developed by the GRADE
working group that guides panel members through
the process of evidence evaluation and consideration
of important information and questions (e.g., values
and preferences of targeted populations), and ensures
transparency in decision-making toward development
of recommendations (22).
Measures and Statistical Analyses
Following the evidence review, the Principal Investi-
gator and GRADE methodologist offered the panel a
draft recommendation for consideration and editing.
The panel was directed to debate the draft statement
and then rate the relevance and clarity separately of
draft recommendation statements. The question of rel-
evance was presented to panel members as follows:
“Is the statement connected/germane to [a] the findings of
the systematic reviews; [b] the balance between benefits and
harms; [c] the values and preferences of the EMS commu-
nity of shift worker clinicians and administrators; [d] any
concerns for resource use (costs); and [e] suitable in its
current form for purposes of guiding the EMS community
with regards to fatigue risk management?” The question of
clarity was presented as follows: “Is the statement clear,
intelligible, appropriately worded, sharp, and easy to under-
stand by a diverse audience?” Panel members scored rel-
evance and clarity on a 4-point ordinal scale: [1] = the
statement is not relevant/clear; [2] = the statement
needs major revisions to be relevant/clear; [3] = the
statement needs minor revisions to be relevant/clear;
and [4] = the statement is relevant/clear. The panel cal-
culated a total score for relevance and clarity separately
by following procedures for the Content Validity Index
(CVI) measure (23). The CVI is the proportion of scores
of 3 or 4 divided by the total number of individual scor-
ers (23). The draft recommendations were revised and
scoring procedure repeated until the total score for rel-
evance and total score for clarity were greater than or
equal to 0.78, a common benchmark for CVI measure-
ment (23). The panel prohibited modifications or edits
to the text or wording of recommendation statements
once the panel’
s score exceeded the CVI benchmark.
RESULTS
Evidence-based recommendations are listed in the
following sections. The CVI score for each of the seven
recommendation statements was 1.0 (See Table 2).
The panel required only a single round of scoring on
relevance and clarity for each draft recommendation
statement before reaching the maximum possible
CVI score of 1.0. The completed EtD frameworks for
each PICO are available in the Online Supplement
Appendices B–H.
Recommendations by Expert Panel
Question 1: Are there reliable and valid instruments for
measuring fatigue among EMS personnel?
Recommendation 1: Recommend using fatigue/
sleepiness survey instruments to measure and monitor
fatigue in EMS personnel.
Strength of Recommendation: Strong
Quality of the Evidence: Low
Panel Remarks and Opinion: In total, the panel con-
sidered evidence from 34 experimental and observa-
tional studies, which was interpreted as supportive
of 14 different fatigue and sleepiness survey instru-

testing of reliability and validity (common indicators of
an instrument’
s utility) with EMS personnel and other
shift worker groups (14). Positive reliability and valid-
ity findings instill confidence, which is important when
choosing an instrument for diagnostic/assessment
purposes. Most studies reported internal consistency
reliability, which refers to the internal correlations
between items that are used to operationalize or define
a construct of interest (24). Other tests of reliability,
such as test–retest reliability, were not widely reported
(14). Validity testing (i.e., criterion-related validity, sen-
sitivity, and specificity) (25) are often more challenging
to assess than reliability. The absence of a gold stan-
dard and consensus objective technique for assessment
of occupational fatigue accounts for the lack of validity
testing (26–29). A gold standard is needed to facilitate
tests of sensitivity and specificity, which are two impor-
tant outcomes for this evidence review (13).
The evidence profile of the 34 included studies
reveals that the overall quality of evidence is low.
The panel considered research design, risk of bias,
and consistency of reported findings across studies;
indirectness of the populations studied; imprecision;
the potential for publication bias; and other considera-
tions that may impact the certainty of findings (i.e., the
evidence) (30). Many panel members raised concerns
about the accuracy of fatigue and sleepiness survey
instruments when used in EMS settings. The conse-
quences of fatigue instrument implementation are
difficult to predict. Inaccurate assessments could lead
personnel to report high levels of fatigue in order to
leverage fatigue mitigation policies that limit or elim-
inate work and invoke mandatory rest. Conversely,
personnel may report low levels of fatigue to avoid
lost opportunities for work or overtime.
Despite these concerns, the panel believes the ben-
efits of using fatigue and sleepiness survey instru-
ments outweigh both their limitations and the liabil-
ities of not using such instruments at all. The survey
instruments identified are easy to use, are supported
by considerable evidence of reliability in shift worker
populations, and show at least some evidence of valid-
ity (e.g., construct, content, and criterion-related with
indirect outcome measures) (14). Furthermore, reliabil-
ity and validity for many of the instruments reviewed
have been demonstrated in studies of non-shift worker
populations (26, 31).
Despite a judgment of low quality of evidence, the
panel concluded that these instruments consistently
measure fatigue in workers similar to EMS personnel
and could feasibly be implemented with limited effort
within the EMS environment. These survey instru-
ments are potentially useful tools to EMS administra-
tors for assessing the fatigue and sleepiness status of
EMS personnel. Their use in a fatigue risk manage-
ment program will do more good than harm. The panel
issues a strong recommendation for their use for the
specific purpose of assessing and monitoring fatigue
and sleepiness in the EMS setting.
While the panel recommends their use, the panel
suggests careful review and consideration of each
instrument. They vary in length, number of scales
(domains) measured, and time periods that are
assessed or referenced. Six of the reviewed survey
instruments solicit feelings of fatigue “in general,”
during the past month, or over the past 7 days (14).
Others solicit perceptions of sustained fatigue over
an unspecified timeframe. Four instruments assess
fatigue either at the time of administration, in the past
24 hours, or at the end of a shift (14). In operational
settings, the terms “fatigue” and “sleepiness” are often
used interchangeably (32). Three survey instruments
assess situational sleepiness (e.g., in real-time), while
one instrument (the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS])
measures sleepiness from a trait-level perspective.

Some instruments may require payment, licensing, or
special permissions issued by the developer prior to
use (33–35).
The panel considered the feasibility of distributing
survey instruments and the potential burden placed
on EMS personnel tasked with repeatedly report-
ing fatigue status. A random or targeted sample of
shifts (rather than all shifts) may provide the opti-
mal balance of utility and feasibility. Random sam-
pling rather than complete sampling is less burden-
some on respondents and may lead to improved rates
of participation. Higher participation will contribute to
a more representative picture of fatigue in the work-
force. The panel also recommends targeted assess-
ments of specific shifts such as extended duration
shifts (e.g., �12 hours), shifts that occur overnight, or
shifts that occur in close proximity (i.e., rapid returns),
including shifts worked across different agencies.
A detailed description of performance measurement
linked to this recommendation is published separately
(36).
Further development and testing of fatigue and
sleepiness survey instruments should be a priority for
future research. The panel recommends investigators
fully test the utility of fatigue and sleepiness survey
instruments with EMS personnel in the EMS opera-
tional environment. Investigators who seek to tailor
instruments to fit the EMS environment should adhere
to the common standards for development and testing
of survey instruments as outlined by Norbeck (37): [1]
clearly defining each construct measured; [2] reference
to the literature linked to the construct of interest; [3]
clear and transparent description of item-scale devel-
opment; [4] analysis of content validity with estab-
lished content validity measurement techniques (23,
38, 39); [5] tests of reliability (24); [6] tests of con-
struct validity; [7] clear description of target popula-
tion for the instrument’
s intended use; [8] description
of sampled respondents; and [9] reporting of common
statistics (e.g., measures of central tendency and dis-
persion) for each item and construct measured (37).
Measurement development should also include use of
qualitative techniques such as focus groups and in-
depth interviews involving the targeted population in
order to solicit input on the constructs being mea-
sured and face validity of draft items. Whether using
one of the 14 instruments identified in this evidence
review or developing new instruments, it is essen-
tial that common indicators of reliability and valid-
ity be reported. These data will guide and help to
improve the future of fatigue/sleepiness assessment
of EMS personnel. See Online Supplement Appendix
B for a summary of our deliberations germane to this
recommendation.
Question 2: In EMS personnel, do shift-scheduling
interventions mitigate fatigue, mitigate fatigue-related
risks, and/or improve sleep?
Recommendation 2: Recommend that EMS person-
nel work shifts shorter than 24 hours in duration.
Strength of Recommendation: Weak
Quality of the Evidence: Very low
Panel Remarks and Opinion: The panel examined
the quality of evidence from 100 studies that com-
pared critical and important outcomes for different
durations of shift work (15). The panel documented
their discussion and decision-making in the EtD frame-
work appearing in Online Supplement Appendix C.
In total, the panel grouped 24 different shift duration
comparisons across 100 studies into three main com-
parisons: 1) shifts < 24 hours versus � 24 hours, 2)
8-hour versus 12-hour shifts, and 3) a composite of
other comparisons that present greater than two shift
durations (multiple comparisons) (15). Given the large
number of studies, the panel aggregated studies with
favorable findings on critical or important outcomes
and compared them to studies with unfavorable or
mixed/inconclusive findings.
Regarding the 15 studies that compared shifts
<24 hours to �24 hours in duration, the ratio of favor-
able findings on critical or important outcomes to unfa-
vorable findings strongly favored shifts <24 hours in
duration (15). Findings from nine studies were judged
favorable toward shifts <24 hours for at least one
outcome. Findings from one study were judged as
unfavorable toward the shorter duration shift for the
outcome of personnel performance. None of the stud-
ies reported unfavorable findings for shorter duration
shifts (<24 hours) on critical outcomes of patient and
personnel safety.
While the findings strongly favored shifts <24 hours
vs. �24 hours in duration, shorter shifts were not sim-
ilarly supported when comparing 8-hour versus 12-
hour shifts or a composite of other combinations of
shorter versus longer shifts (15). The panel determined
that the existing evidence is mixed with respect to the
8-hour versus 12-hour shift comparison. Similarly, the
panel identified no convincing pattern of evidence for
or against shifts of other durations.
The panel acknowledges an ongoing debate regard-
ing the safety and impact of longer versus shorter shifts
in the EMS workplace (40). The desirable anticipated
effects of EMS personnel working shifts shorter than
24 hours include reduced fatigue, improved alertness,
better sleep and sleep quality, better health and wellbe-
ing of personnel, and improved safety for patients and
personnel (41). Undesirable anticipated effects might
include potentially higher cost to the system (42, 43),
reduced access to care for patients, and increased risks
to personnel.
Numerous factors may impact the costs associ-
ated with shorter versus longer shift durations, and
these costs will vary system-to-system (e.g., size
of workforce, deployment model). Costs may be
greater with shorter versus longer shift durations (e.g.,
 94
PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE

VOLUME 22 / NUMBER S1
predominantly 8-hour versus predominantly 12-hour
shift schedules) (42–44). These data mostly come from
studies of police departments, where shift schedules
and rotations are fairly consistent (e.g., 8-hour shifts,
3 shifts per 24-hour period, with set days of rotation)
and may be meaningful to a subset of EMS operations
with similar shift schedules. Longer shifts lead to
less frequent transitions of medical crews, which are
particularly important in EMS settings where medical
equipment needs to be signed out and/or checked at
the beginning of each shift, creating lead time before
being able to respond to medical incidents.
The panel recognized that many EMS personnel
favor longer duration shifts. Recovery between shifts
is potentially greater with longer duration of shifts
(45). Longer duration shifts may allow for additional
employment due to less time spent to travel and tran-
sition to and from work. This may be especially impor-
tant for EMS agencies with bases located in remote
locations (e.g., air medical providers or rural EMS
agencies), and longer shifts may influence the ability
to recruit individuals to work at these locations. Many
EMS personnel (>80% in some locations) report multi-
ple jobs (45, 46), and modifications in shift scheduling
may impact the feasibility of employment with multi-
ple organizations or recovery between shifts. To some
stakeholders, a reduction in the number of personnel
with multiple jobs would be viewed as a potentially
positive step for safety, health, and wellbeing. Others
may react differently. The panel accepts the validity of
such concerns, and the challenge of finding viable solu-
tions. However, such concerns and challenges should
be addressed within the context of consistent findings
from numerous empirical studies.
Some remote and low-volume EMS operations rely
on extended duration shifts due to limited resources
and personnel to staff ambulances. It may not be
practical, or cost-effective, and potentially not safe
to eliminate extended duration shifts in some EMS
operations. The decision to implement specific shift
durations should not be based solely on the evidence,
which the panel believes favors a recommendation of
shifts <24 hours in duration (refer to Online Supple-
ment Appendix C). However, the panel encourages
organizations to consider the evidence, the benefits
versus potential dangers of shifts �24-hours in their
systems and community, the values and preferences
of their EMS personnel, and the costs unique to their
EMS operation. If shifts �24 hours must be utilized to
ensure adequate staffing, other fatigue risk mitigation
strategies outlined in these guidelines should be imple-
mented to optimally balance safety, performance, and
retention of EMS personnel.
Future research should investigate: [1] if critical and
important outcomes (e.g., patient safety) differ in EMS
systems that operate longer versus shorter duration
shifts; [2] if the costs and resource requirements of
longer versus shorter duration shift schedules differ by
size of the EMS operation (e.g., small, medium, large
organizations); and [3] if it is cost-effective for EMS
operations to move from longer to shorter shifts.
Question 3: In EMS personnel, does the worker’
s use
of fatigue countermeasures mitigate fatigue, mitigate
fatigue-related risks, and/or improve sleep?
Recommendation 3: Recommend that EMS person-
nel have access to caffeine as a fatigue countermeasure.
Strength of Recommendation: Weak
Quality of the Evidence: Low
Panel Remarks and Opinion: The evidence review
shows the positive effects of caffeine on psychomotor
vigilance, which is important for performance, and on
acute fatigue and sleepiness (16). However, the health
and safety risks associated with excess caffeine con-
sumption should also be addressed (47, 48). Excess caf-
feine may contribute to onset of, or difficulty manag-
ing, conditions such as anxiety and cardiac dysrhyth-
mias (47, 48). The safety profile of longer-term caffeine
consumption for mitigation of workplace fatigue is not
well known (49). Individuals will often self-regulate
consumption and caffeine is generally safe at low to
moderate doses (e.g., 250 mg/day) (49). Sleep may be
affected by caffeine and additional guidance on use in
the workplace is needed (50, 51).
Caffeine is readily available in many EMS settings,
but may not be considered proactively by EMS systems
as a tool to mitigate fatigue, particularly for shifts of
prolonged duration or taking place during overnight
periods. There is a minimal amount of information to
inform EMS administrators regarding the total costs
(e.g., annual) of providing access to caffeine in the
EMS setting. The costs of providing caffeinated bever-
ages might exceed thousands of dollars annually for
moderate to large EMS operations. Costs may differ
depending on the type of EMS deployment model.
For instance, EMS personnel deployed from fixed base
sites may have easier access to caffeine than person-
nel deployed dynamically in the ambulance. Person-
nel deployed in ambulances for the duration of their
shift may find access to caffeine challenging for a num-
ber of reasons (e.g., proximity to businesses that sell
caffeinated beverages). The panel recommends EMS
administrators provide access to caffeine regardless of
system deployment and whether it is provided directly
or not.
Consumption of caffeine for the purposes of miti-
gating work-related fatigue in the EMS environment
should be guided by education and training in a robust
fatigue risk management program that recognizes caf-
feine use as only one component of a comprehen-
sive fatigue management strategy. A formal program
is recommended for monitoring utilization, safety, and
the impact of caffeine on EMS personnel performance.
The panel also calls for future research to explore the
route, dosing, and timing of caffeine for diverse EMS
shift schedules and operations (Online Supplement
Appendix D).

Question 4: In EMS personnel, does the use of sleep
or rest strategies and/or interventions mitigate fatigue,
fatigue-related risks, and/or improve sleep?
Recommendation 4: Recommend that EMS person-
nel have the opportunity to nap while on duty to miti-
gate fatigue.
Strength of Recommendation: Weak
Quality of the Evidence: Very low
Panel Remarks and Opinion: The panel reviewed
the evidence for shift workers napping while on
duty (17). The panel determined that current evi-
dence supports the use of naps while on duty as an
effective strategy to positively impact fatigue-related
outcomes. Naps improve alertness, reduce sleepiness,
and improve personnel performance (e.g., reaction
time).
While the available evidence supports napping, sev-
eral potential undesirable effects may occur. The most
important of these is sleep inertia, a period of reduced
alertness or impaired cognition immediately after wak-
ing (52, 53). Sleep inertia may inhibit EMS personnel
response times, especially from the time of notification
to the time when personnel are in the ambulance (appa-
ratus) and en route. Standards followed by many EMS
operations, such as the National Fire Protection Asso-
ciation’
s (NFPA) Standard 1710 of one-minute turnout
time, may be impacted by personnel who engage in
napping.
The review of the evidence did not address the opti-
mal duration of the nap or the impact that nap dura-
tion has on sleep inertia (17). Naps ranging from 15
to 120 minutes during shift work have been associ-
ated with better performance and reduced levels of
acute fatigue/sleepiness (17). Some evidence indicates
that shorter duration naps (e.g., 10 minutes) lessen the
risk of sleep inertia, while providing some rest and/or
recovery (53). The use of naps as a fatigue counter-
measure will likely take different forms in different
EMS organizations. Some may decide to implement
short duration naps, whereas other organizations may
choose to utilize longer duration naps, or some combi-
nation of naps with deployment of additional person-
nel and resources as a possible temporary replacement
for personnel engaged in napping. The panel believed
that EMS organizations can develop innovative poli-
cies and protocols for napping, while at the same time
accounting for the possibility of sleep inertia. The ben-
efits of napping, as shown in the evidence review (17),
outweigh the risks.
The general public may perceive EMS personnel nap-
ping on duty as unacceptable. The panel concluded
that the benefits of improved alertness on duty, and
ultimately improved patient and personnel safety, are a
commonsense justification to this anticipated undesir-
able effect. Additionally, it is common knowledge that
many EMS personnel and other first responders work
long duration shifts requiring nighttime sleep when
not on a response. Policies and protocols that clearly
describe the appropriate use, structure, and benefits of
naps on duty may be useful toward educating the pub-
lic and reducing potential negative opinion.
Many EMS organizations have existing facilities that
enable napping. Some organizations may incur costs
to modify or construct facilities that allow an indi-
vidual to lie down and limit exposure to light and
noise, which are important characteristics of work-
place napping facilities (54, 55). The true costs associ-
ated with an intra-shift napping policy or program are
unclear. Operations that use dynamic deployment will
face unique challenges adopting and implementing a
policy of napping. A nap in the front cab of the ambu-
lance (apparatus) is likely better than no nap. Adminis-
trators may consider a requirement that personnel nap
only when in the passenger seat (securely belted) or
patient compartment (securely belted) to avoid the pos-
sible negative effects of sleep inertia on operating the
ambulance immediately upon waking and while not
fully alert.
None of the reviewed studies demonstrated an
impact on the critical outcome for this evidence review
(personnel safety). However, the expert panel con-
cluded that napping during shifts can be an effective
strategy to mitigate fatigue and fatigue-related risks,
especially in extended duration shifts (e.g., �12 hours)
and shifts during overnight periods. Napping during
shifts may be beneficial for EMS personnel who work
contiguous shifts (without breaks in between) or con-
secutive shifts with short rest periods (rapid returns),
within or between agencies. Napping may be a use-
ful tool to mitigate the effects of fatigue even in shifts
<12 hours in duration or on shifts occurring during
daylight hours. Permitting naps does not absolve EMS
personnel of the responsibility to present to work well
rested. The panel recommends that EMS agencies have
a broad policy that allows napping at all hours, and
that they work toward providing adequate nap facil-
ities whenever possible.
The panel recommends a formal program of mon-
itoring be established to determine utilization and
impact of intra-shift naps on important and critical
outcomes (Online Supplement Appendix E). Future
research should involve EMS personnel to determine
the optimal duration of an intra-shift nap, the optimal
timing of naps during shifts, what constitutes an ade-
quate location for a nap, and assesses the time interval
immediately post nap.
Question 5: In EMS personnel, does fatigue training
and education mitigate fatigue, fatigue-related risks,
and/or improve sleep?
Recommendation 5: Recommend that EMS person-
nel receive education and training to mitigate fatigue
and fatigue-related risks.
Strength of Recommendation: Weak
Quality of the Evidence: Low

PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
FEBRUARY 2018
VOLUME 22 / NUMBER S1
Panel Remarks and Opinion: The panel discovered
a variety of programs to deliver fatigue/sleep educa-
tion and training of shift workers, which use multi-
ple formats (e.g., lectures and workshops), durations
(e.g., one hour presentations and eight-week courses),
instructors (e.g., fatigue experts, teammates and peers),
and delivery methods (e.g., in person, online, or via
email) (18). Our evidence review of 18 studies showed a
favorable relationship between education and training
in fatigue (and sleep health) and important outcomes
of patient and personnel safety (18). A meta-analysis
of five studies showed improvements in shift worker
sleep quality four to eight weeks after fatigue educa-
tion and training (18).
Education and training in fatigue and sleep health
may have the anticipated and desirable effect of identi-
fying undiagnosed sleep disorders such as obstructive
sleep apnea (OSA) (56). Large numbers of EMS per-
sonnel are at risk of OSA and other sleep disorders
that contribute to fatigue and poor sleep quality
(1, 57). Being overweight or obese (a risk factor for
OSA) affects three-quarters of EMS personnel and
75% of EMS personnel fail to meet recommenda-
tions for physical activity (1, 58). The panel believes
that increased awareness of sleep disorders through
education and training will contribute to increased
awareness
and
subsequent
diagnosis,
ultimately
reducing fatigue in the EMS workplace.
Costs of workplace health and wellness programs
that address fatigue and sleep health are a concern.
Costs will likely vary, and the total cost burden for the
average EMS organization is unknown. Costs of gen-
eral worksite health, wellness, and fitness programs
range from 130 to 150 U.S. dollars per employee per
year (59, 60). Adding fatigue or sleep health modules
to an existing program may be cost-neutral or minimal
in real dollars for some EMS organizations. The panel
does not provide recommendations or suggestions for
the depth, breadth, or source of content for fatigue or
sleep health education. Multiple methods, and sources
of content, may be needed to educate and train EMS
personnel on these topics (61). Findings from the meta-
analysis of five diverse programs were favorable for
personnel sleep quality, regardless of which program
was analyzed in the pooled analysis (18). The panel
believes EMS organizations may choose to use a vari-
ety of sources for their content, develop education and
training tailored to their organization’
s needs, and be
able to introduce fatigue and sleep health education
and training for minimal cost.
EMS personnel should receive fatigue education and
training during new employee orientation/training, as
well as every 2 years, in order to prevent decay in
knowledge (62–67), skills (62–67), and proficiency in
techniques that can help mitigate fatigue and fatigue-
related risks. Recommended retraining at least every
two years is consistent with existing recommenda-
tions for other required educational programs for
EMS providers, including cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion and advanced cardiac life support. Education and
training in fatigue and sleep health should be a key
component of a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the
effects of fatigue related to EMS shift work. Research
priorities include investigating: [1] the content that has
a meaningful impact on outcomes; [2] the effectiveness
of diverse methods of educating and training person-
nel; [3] the costs of education and training; and [4] the
impact of education and training on the behavior(s) of
EMS personnel. See Online Supplement Appendix F
for a summary of our deliberations germane to this rec-
ommendation.
Question 6: In EMS personnel, does implementa-
tion of model-based fatigue risk management mitigate
fatigue, mitigate fatigue-related risks, and/or improve
sleep?
Recommendation 6: No recommendation: The con-
fidence in effect estimates is insufficient to make a
recommendation at this time (Reference to GRADE
Handbook 6.1.4).
Strength of Recommendation: Not applicable
Quality of the Evidence: Very low
Panel Remarks and Opinion: The evidence review
produced only one study that met criteria for inclu-
sion (19). Findings from this one study were favorable
for two important outcomes of interest. However, the
panel determined that the body of evidence evaluated
for this research question was insufficient for purposes
of making a recommendation. The panel recognizes
that biomathematical modeling is a novel approach for
determining the role of sleep and circadian rhythms in
relation to fatigue (68). A preponderance of the exist-
ing research reports on development and modification
of models to improve fatigue estimation (69–74). The
systematic review did not intend to examine this infor-
mation; instead the review sought to identify the evi-
dence that implementation of a biomathematical model
impacts outcomes like safety. The panel discovered a
minimal amount of evidence, yet the panel believes
these models will one day be an instrumental compo-
nent of fatigue risk mitigation for EMS organizations.
Their widespread use in aviation, rail, and other high-
risk industries suggests utility and promise for EMS
fatigue risk management (68).
While biomathematical fatigue models may reduce
fatigue and improve safety, undesirable effects may
include improper reliance on such models to estimate
individual “fitness for duty.” Licensing biomathemati-
cal models from suppliers or service providers entails
recognized, unpublished costs.
Priorities for future research in this area include
determining the unique sleep and circadian patterns
of EMS personnel, given that these data are key inputs
for biomathematical models. Next, use of models
calibrated with EMS inputs should be evaluated for

impact on critical and important outcomes such as
patient and personnel safety. The panel documented
discussions
and conclusions
about this evidence
review in the EtD framework (see Online Supplement
Appendix G).
Question 7: In EMS personnel, do task load interven-
tions mitigate fatigue, mitigate fatigue-related risks,
and/or improve sleep?
Recommendation 7: No recommendation: The con-
fidence in effect estimates is insufficient to make a
recommendation at this time (Reference to GRADE
Handbook 6.1.4).
Strength of Recommendation: Not applicable
Quality of the Evidence: Very low
Panel Remarks and Opinion: The search produced
five prospective observational studies (20), with wide
variation in the description and definitions of task
load and workload. One study investigated the rela-
tionships between workload, fatigue, and personnel
performance. None of the evidence reviewed inves-
tigated the relationship between task load (or work-
load), fatigue, and personnel safety, patient safety, and
cost to the system. The panel concluded that evidence
quality was very low and determined that this body
of evidence was insufficient for purposes of making a
recommendation.
Task load and workload are of interest to many
administrators of shift workers. While modifying task
load or workload (e.g., reducing workload) may help
to reduce fatigue and fatigue-related risks (75), poten-
tially undesirable effects may also occur. Areduction in
patient volume (one possible measure of EMS task load
or workload) could contribute to loss of skill and pro-
ficiency with caring for acutely ill and injured patients
(76). This may contribute to error, especially when
dealing with patients that need time-sensitive inter-
vention (76). Reducing workload without appropriate
accommodations in staffing may increase response
times or decrease patient access to care. It may also
add cost to the system through decreased unit-hour
utilization, a common metric used in the EMS industry
to track workload.
Task load or workload interventions may take on
many different forms. Possibilities include [a] deploy-
ment of additional personnel and ambulances to cover
for others who may reach a threshold of workload;
and [b] limiting the number of transports or patient
encounters per crew per shift. Interventions of this
type would increase costs for the system. While the
panel believes these interventions are possible, it is
unclear how different stakeholders view these and
other similar options for modifying EMS crew task
load or workload.
If an EMS organization chooses to modify task load
or workload, the panel recommends a formal program
to monitor and evaluate the intervention. The panel
advocates the following research priorities: [1] iden-
tify common tasks in EMS that contribute to fatigue
and/or fatigue-related risks; [2] determine which tasks
contribute the least or most to fatigue; [3] investigate
the impact of a task load or workload intervention on
fatigue, safety, and other important/critical outcomes;
and [4] test the reliability and validity of measures
designed to quantify task load/workload specifically
for the EMS setting. The panel’
s discussions and con-
clusions relevant to this evidence review are recorded
in the GRADE EtD framework (see Online Supplement
Appendix H).
DISCUSSION
Fatigue risk management is a shared responsibility
between EMS organizations and personnel (6, 77).
All EMS personnel have a responsibility to report
for duty well-rested, and EMS employers have a
responsibility to proactively identify fatigue (6), deter-
mine when fatigue is a threat, and mitigate fatigue
with strategies informed by evidence-based recom-
mendations. Successful implementation will require a
comprehensive strategy tailored to local needs, given
the diversity of EMS organizations and personnel.
Regardless of organization type or classification of per-
sonnel, EMS administrators should strive to fully inte-
grate fatigue risk management into daily operations
and make fatigue mitigation a core component of the
organization’
s safety culture.
Implementing an effective fatigue risk management
program requires multiple strategies (multiple layers
of defense) (78). For example, one of the panel’
s rec-
ommendations endorses shift durations <24 hours
in duration. Hours-of-service restrictions should be
a fundamental part of a comprehensive fatigue risk
management program, but they should not be the
program’
s sole focus or feature. Limiting the hours-
of-service for shift workers was a common twentieth
century tactic for fatigue management in numerous
high-risk industries (79, 80). Modern approaches
combine hours-of-service policies with fatigue miti-
gation strategies (77–79). The panel believes that EMS
administrators jeopardize the success of fatigue risk
management if the sole focus is on hours-of-service.
Limiting work hours to <24 hours may be harmful
to some EMS personnel and their patients in rural,
frontier, or otherwise remote locations. In these loca-
tions, personnel may need to travel great distances for
many hours to and from work. The opportunity to rest
and recover may be extensive given limited workload
and low patient volume. In such settings, shorter shift
durations may elevate risk rather than reduce it, and
fatigue risk management programs focused primar-
ily on hours-of-service may be counterproductive.
Thus, the panel advised EMS administrators to imple-
ment a program that incorporates multiple strategies
supported by evidence.

PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
FEBRUARY 2018
VOLUME 22 / NUMBER S1
Administrators should communicate with personnel
to understand the potential impact of recommen-
dations on daily operations, personnel health, and
work-life balance. Such communication may reveal
informal strategies that are tightly aligned with recom-
mendations in these guidelines and that might easily
be transformed into formal strategies (81). A change in
shift duration, for example, might impact staffing and
frequency of crew substitutions and rotations. Person-
nel may reveal an informal process of shift swaps or
substitutions between personnel that could inform a
formal plan if shift duration becomes a focus for fatigue
risk management. Implementing a nap period during
shifts could similarly impact operations. In some loca-
tions, EMS administrators may consider staggering
naps between partners so that at least one crewmember
is alert to initiate driving toward a response. Personnel
may reveal an alternative approach that is equally
attentive to safety, yet more feasible. While implemen-
tation of other recommendations (e.g., providing access
to caffeine) potentially has less impact on daily EMS
operations, administrators should consider the impact
prior to implementation and engage personnel in the
development and tailoring of program components.
Administrators will face challenges and potential
barriers to implementation of recommendations that
can be overcome with awareness and planning. Altru-
ism, the belief in one’
s own invulnerability to fatigue,
and poor organizational safety culture are some of the
many potential barriers or threats to successful fatigue
risk management in the EMS setting. Persons entering
the EMS occupation report sensation seeking, altruism,
and commitment to community (82, 83). Many of these
individuals may be willing to work extended work
periods, and administrators may be willing to approve
large amounts of overtime or extended work periods
when faced with deficits in personnel and coverage.
Some EMS personnel, as reason for choosing the EMS
occupation, may judge themselves as invulnerable to
fatigue and discount or reject common signs of fatigue
as nothing more than part of the job, a sign of weak-
ness, or not in keeping with the occupational identity
of an EMS professional (84). Other personnel may lack
a personal commitment to fatigue mitigation based on
a poor perception of their organization’
s safety culture
and commitment to personnel safety (85). Many may
be unaware of the dangers associated with fatigue,
sleep deprivation, and shift work. Mistrust between
administrators and EMS personnel is a barrier to suc-
cessful implementation of fatigue risk management
and a safety culture (80). Faced with these and other
barriers or threats, EMS administrators should clearly
communicate their support for the evidence-based
recommendations adopted. Increasing the awareness
of fatigue as a threat should be a top priority, as limited
awareness of the problem and solutions supported by
evidence are commonly cited barriers to successful
implementation of evidence-based guidelines (86).
Sample protocols and policies are a means of improv-
ing the feasibility and timeliness of implementing
guidelines. The approaches to fatigue risk management
will differ across EMS organizations. The panel rec-
ommends administrators use a checklist to facilitate
the implementation of a successful and comprehen-
sive fatigue risk management program. An example
checklist appears as Table 2 in a separate publication
(36). Administrators should use this checklist in con-
cert with the performance measures and instructions
for incorporating performance measurement and eval-
uation described in a separate publication (36).
LIMITATIONS
The panel, which was formed based on the IOM’
s rec-
ommendations for panel composition (8), included rep-
resentatives from a variety of disciplines (i.e., sleep
medicine, fatigue science, emergency medicine). A dif-
ferent panel with a different set of PICO questions may
have created recommendations unlike those produced
in this study.
The GRADE framework is an emerging standard
for development of EBGs that inform clinical practice
and occupational health (11, 87). The panel utilized the
Model Process for EBG development germane to the
prehospital environment, and adhered to the GRADE
framework for evaluating the certainty in evidence and
formulating recommendations (10, 11). Other method-
ological processes for guideline development exist and
could yield different evaluations of the evidence and
recommendations.
Similar efforts to produce EBGs report using a
“majority vote” to determine agreement on recom-
mendation statements (88). The panel felt it impor-
tant to objectively measure agreement of the panel
on the wording of recommendations. The panel
used the CVI and established CVI benchmarks to
quantify
relevance
and
clarity,
which
the
panel
feels improved the objectivity of the protocol and
findings (23).
CONCLUSIONS
Fatigue is an important issue that impacts all EMS per-
sonnel. The panel completed a rigorous process for
the creation of evidence-based guidelines for fatigue
risk management in the EMS setting. The panel rec-
ommends using fatigue and sleepiness survey instru-
ments for assessing and monitoring fatigue. The panel
recommends scheduling shifts <24 hours whenever
possible, providing access to caffeine throughout shifts,
incorporating on-duty naps, and providing education
and training in fatigue risk management. The evidence
on which the panel based these recommendations is
substantial, although generally of low quality. Imple-
mentation of these evidence-based recommendations
has the potential to improve multiple fatigue-related
