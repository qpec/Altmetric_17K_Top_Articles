Hands may show early signs of aging with altered skin texture, skin permeability
and vascular properties. In clinics, a hand volumeter is used to measure swelling
of hands due to edema, carpal tunnel syndrome or drug interventions. The hand
volume measurements are generally taken without taking age into consideration. We
hypothesized that age affects hand volumeter measurements and that the younger age
group (≤40 years) records a greater change in hand volume as compared to the older
group (>40 years). Four volumetric measurements were taken at 5 min intervals during
20 min of water immersion using a clinically-approved hand volumeter. After 20 min of
immersion, the hand volume changes of the younger age group were significantly higher
than the older age group (p < 0.001). Specifically, the right-hand volume of the younger
age group (≤40 years, n = 30) increased by 4.3 ± 2%, and the left hand increased by
3.4 ± 2.1%. Conversely, the right-hand volume of the older age group (>40 years, n = 10)
increased by 2.2 ± 2.0%, and the left hand decreased by 0.6 ± 2.4% after 20 min of
water immersion. The data are presented as Mean ± SD. Hand volume changes were not
correlated with body mass index (BMI) or gender, and furthermore, neither of these two
variables affected the relationship between age and hand volume changes with water
immersion. We conclude that the younger age group has a higher increase in hand
volume with water immersion as compared to the older age group.

INTRODUCTION
Hand volume measurements by water immersion are used extensively in the clinical setting for
measuring swelling of limbs due to post-mastectomy lymphedema (Karges et al., 2003), carpal
tunnel syndrome (Braun et al., 1989), rheumatoid arthritis (Rembe, 1970) and post-traumatic
conditions (Griffin et al., 1990). The degree of swelling is graded based on the weight of water
displaced after hand immersion. Hand volume is typically measured using a hand volumeter, by
weighing the water displaced after a limb is immersed in a water-filled hand volume chamber.
The volume of the hand is directly proportional to the weight of the water displaced, according
to Archimedes’ principle. Due to consistent results and ease of performance with limited resources,
water displacement is considered a gold standard for hand volume measurements in several
diseases. Moreover, this technique is popular in less developed countries with scarce resources and
poor clinical facilities. One issue with this technique is that when hand volume measurements are
made in the clinic, patient age is generally not taken into account while interpreting the differences
in hand volume pre and post-water immersion.

Hand Volume Changes with Age
Although the hands of most people are very similar
anatomically and physiologically, they are susceptible to the
vagaries of aging, as they are one of the most frequently used
body parts and exposed to environmental insults on a daily
basis. With time and injury, hand functions begin to decline
and manifest the effects of aging. Dietary, behavioral, genetic,
metabolic and environmental factors are associated with age-
related loss of hand dexterity (Flatt, 1960). Dietary factors,
including malnutrition, lead to loss of homeostasis of minerals,
especially alterations in calcium metabolism. Behavioral factors
such as sedentary lifestyle and lack of exercise may also lead to
accelerated decline in hand function (Flatt, 1960). Certain genetic
factors involving mitochondrial activity, fatty acid metabolism
and cancer may influence aging of hands (Reed et al., 1991;
Glass et al., 2013). Frequent exposure to ultraviolet light (Akiba
et al., 1999) and airborne particulate matter (Kim et al., 2016)
may lead to greater aging effects and breakdown of collagen,
especially in exposed skin. The skin of the hand is also exposed
to other kinds of environmental stresses such as abrasions,
lacerations and burns, thus accumulating these insults over a
lifetime. Dry skin, which is characteristic of aging, has poor
skin barrier functions (Epstein and Maibach, 1965; Plewig, 1970;
Rougier et al., 1988), which may affect skin permeability. Thus,
the decline in skin permeability with age may be measurable by
hand volume changes during water immersion. Anatomical aging
of hands affects joints, muscle, tendon, bone, nerve, blood supply,
skin, and fingernails. The effects of aging on hand volume after
immersion are unknown. In this study, we determined if such
age-related effects exist. The hypothesis of the study was that an
older age group will have less hand volume change with water
immersion as compared to a younger age group.
METHODS
Participants
Forty participants between the ages of 13 and 65 years
participated in this study. Twenty three were males and 18 were
females. Thirty participants were in the 13–40 age group, and 10
were in the 41–65 age group. Thirty subjects had a relatively low
body mass index (BMI < 25), and 10 subjects were overweight
(BMI ≥ 25). None of the subjects had cardiovascular problems
nor were they taking any medication at the time of this study.
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of University of California, San Diego. Prior to the study, the
experimental protocol was explained to the subjects and their
written informed consents were obtained. The subjects also
signed HIPAA consent forms to grant the researchers access to
their medical histories, which they provided as a part of the study.
For subjects under 18 years of age, both the subject and the
subject’s parent or legal guardian signed the consent form.
Equipment
Hand Volumeter
All hand volume water displacement measurements were taken
using a commercially-available volumeter designed specifically
to measure hand volume (Hand Volumeter, Volumeters United,
Pheonix, AZ). The device is a clear acrylic box with a stopper
in the form of a horizontal bar located at the base to maintain
consistency of the hand immersion between subjects. For each
experiment, the volumeter was filled with a 3% ethanol 97%
water solution to the level of an extended lip through which
the displaced liquid flows. The water solution contained ethanol
so as to reduce surface tension and improve accuracy and
reproducibility of measurements (Hargens et al., 2014).
Water Bath
The subjects’ hands were immersed in a large acrylic tub filled
with tap water. The water in the tub was kept at constant
temperature of 37◦C by a heating coil submerged in the water.
A thermometer was placed in the water at the beginning and end
of each 5 min interval to ensure that the water was maintained at
37◦C. Paper outlines in the shapes of typical adult right and left
hands were taped on the outside of the acrylic tub on the wall
closest to the subject to act as a guide and maintain consistencies
in hand position. On the right outline was written “Place right
hand here” and on the left outline “Place left hand here” in
order to ensure that the subject’s hand was in the same position
for all four immersion periods of each hand. The subjects were
seated for the hand immersion protocol and the chair adjusted
according to the height of the individuals. The hands were
positioned at the same levels as the heart. This was consistent
between the subjects.
Experimental Protocol
Subjects were asked to remove all rings, watches and bands from
their hands to eliminate extraneous variables from hand volume
measurements. The subjects were also asked to wash their hands
with soap solution, rinse and dry them thoroughly before the
experiment. The hand volumeter was over-filled with the 3%
ethanol solution and maintained at 37◦C. A measuring cup was
placed under the extended lip of the hand volumeter to collect the
excess solution. The filled apparatus was allowed to sit and drain
the excess fluid until no more solution flowed out of the extended
lip. At this point, a plastic container, which was previously zeroed
on a balance (OHAUS Triple Beam Balance 700 Series, accurate
to 0.01 g), was placed under the extended lip. The subject’s right
hand was slowly immersed in the apparatus such that the third
web (intermetacarpal) space of the subject’s hand placed slight
pressure on the stopper rod. The subject’s hand was kept in
that position until the ethanol solution stopped flowing. At this
point, the plastic container containing the displaced ethanol was
removed and placed on the weighing balance. The measurement
was recorded to 0.01 g after each time the subject’s hand was
immersed in the hand volumeter. This mass measurement was
later converted to a volume measurement (ml) by dividing it by
the density of the 3% ethanol solution (0.99367 g/ml). After every
measurement, the subject was provided with tissue paper to dry
their hand in order to prevent systematic errors.
After an initial baseline volume measurement, the subject’s
right hand was immersed for 5 min in the 37◦C water bath.
The subject’s hand was relaxed but reproducibly submerged in
the water, as guided by the paper outlines. After 5 min, the
subject was asked to remove and dry their hand. The steps
specified above (measurement of volume displaced and 5 min

immersion in 37◦C water) were repeated in this order 3 times for
a total of 4 rounds and 20 min of immersion in the 37◦C water.
Following the final immersion in the water, the subject’s right
hand volume was measured one last time and recorded for a total
of 5 measurements of volume displaced. This entire process was
then repeated with the subject’s left hand in random order.
Statistics
For statistical evaluation, subjects were divided into two groups:
≤40 years and >40 years. The experiments were randomized
with either the right hand first or the left hand. The data
are expressed as means ± standard deviations of changes in
the hand volume with respect to age, time, gender and BMI.
The statistical significance between the hand volume changes
between age groups (≤40 years and >40 years) was computed
using unpaired two-tailed t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests. The
differences between left and right hand volume changes over
time (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min), and comparisons by BMI and
gender were performed using multiple t-tests on the raw values.
All statistics were performed in the graphpad prism software.
Significance was set at p<0.05.
RESULTS
Hand Volume Changes with Age
Volumetric assessments showed significant differences in hand
volume measurements between the younger (≤40 years) and
older (>40 years) age groups. The younger age group had
significantly higher changes in hand volume after 20 min of water
immersion compared to the older age group (Figure 1). The
right-hand volume change of the younger age group was 4.3 ±
2.0% from baseline compared to 2.2 ± 2.0% in the older age
group (Figure 1A). The left-hand volume differences between
the younger and older age group were more apparent. The left-
hand volume of the younger age group increased 3.5 ± 2.1%
from baseline compared to minimal change of 0.6 ± 2.4% from
baseline in the older age group (Figure 1B). The hand volume
measurements of younger age group were significantly higher
than the older age group.
Association of Hand Volume Changes with
Age and Time
Temporal changes from baseline in the right and left hand
volumes after different times of immersion (5, 10, 15 and 20 min)
were plotted for each age group (Figure 2). Overall, the right-
and left-hand volumes increased with time (Figures 2A,B). In
the younger age group, the right-hand volume changes with time
were 2.7 ± 1.9% after 5 min, 3.3 ± 1.6% after 10 min, 4.3 ± 1.7%
after 15 min and 4.5 ± 1.9% after 20 min of water immersion. In
the older age group, the right-hand volume changes with time
were 2.4 ± 1.4% after 5 min, 3.0 ± 1.9% after 10 min, 2.5 ± 3.0%
after 15 min and 2.2 ± 2.0% after 20 min of water immersion
(Figure 2A). The left-hand volume increased incrementally with
time for the younger age group: 2.6 ± 1.9% after 5 min, 2.9
± 2.3% after 10 min, 3.0 ± 2.4% after 15 min and 3.2 ± 2.4%
after 20 min of water immersion. However, the left-hand volume
changes decreased with time for the older age group. The left
hand volumes were 0.6 ± 0.9% after 5 min, 0.2 ± 1.1% after
10 min, 0.5 ± 0.9% after 15 min and 0.1 ± 1.9% after 20 min of
water immersion (Figure 2B). Consistently the older age group
showed less change in hand volume over time compared to the
younger age group.
Association of Hand Volume Changes with
Age and Gender
To evaluate if hand volume changes were associated with gender,
the hand volume changes after 20 min immersion for male and
female participants of each age group were compared. The mean
for the right-hand volume of males was 3.4 ± 1.5% compared
to 3.8 ± 1.2% for females in the younger age group (Figure 3A).
The mean for the right-hand volume of older age group males
was 2.2 ± 1.8% compared to 4.8 ± 3.5% for females. The mean
for the left-hand volume of males was 3.2 ± 1.6% compared to
4.1 ± 2.7% for females in the younger age group (Figure 3B).
The mean for the right-hand volume of older age group males
was 0.2 ± 2.2% compared to 1.1 ± 2.9% for females. The gender
differences are not statistically significant suggesting that gender
may not play the primary role in the age-related difference in
hand volumeter measurements.
Association of Hand Volume Changes with
Age and BMI
The results suggested that BMI may not be associated with age
and hand volume changes. Although BMI had no significant
effect on the hand volume change, larger hands displace more
water compared to smaller hands and the change from baseline
was higher in overweight individuals compared to normal weight
individuals. However, the effects of BMI on hand volume were
independent of age. The right-hand volume change of overweight
individuals (BMI ≥ 25) was 2.6 ± 2.2% compared to 2.2 ± 3.7%
in normal weight (BMI < 25) individuals in the younger age
group (Figure 4A). The left hand volume change of overweight
individuals is 2.8 ± 2.5% compared to 0.4 ± 1.8% in normal
weight individuals in the younger age group (Figure 4B). This
documented that hand volume changes depend more on age and
are not associated with the corresponding BMI.
DISCUSSION
Measurement of hand volume using the hand volumeter is a
useful tool in clinics with limited infra-structure to measure
edema in disease conditions or after limb swelling surgery. The
technique is more sensitive and consistent compared to tape
measures used more commonly in the clinics. Our study supports
our hypothesis that after 20 min of immersion in water, hand
volume of the younger age group (≤40 years) increases more than
that of the older age group (>40 years). Gender and BMI have
no significant effect on the age-related changes in hand volumes
measured using the hand volumeter. Our data have important
clinical implications in measurement of hand volume changes
with immersion in younger vs. older patients. In other words,
patient age must be considered along with disease state.

Values are means ± SD. *p < 0.05 by multiple t-tests.
Certain diseases such as post-mastectomy lymphedema
(Karges et al., 2003), carpal tunnel syndrome (Braun et al.,
1989), rheumatoid arthritis (Rembe, 1970), and post-traumatic
conditions (Griffin et al., 1990) result in the swelling of hands.
Apart from tape measurement, a more accurate reading of hand
swelling is obtained using a hand volumeter in the clinical setting.
The volumeter measurement is considered the most accurate
“gold standard” as it can detect small changes in hand volume
(DeVore and Hamilton, 1968; Holbrook and Odland, 1974; King,
1993; Hargens et al., 2014). However, age is generally not taken
into consideration while measuring swelling of the hand using a
hand volumeter.
Our results document that age affects hand volumeter data
and therefore should be considered while interpreting the results
for patients. Exactly how aging affects changes in hand volume
during immersion is not known. Decreased skin permeability
and accumulation of dead skin cells with age may be factors that
contribute to reduced water uptake during hand immersion with
age (Epstein and Maibach, 1965; Plewig, 1970; Rougier et al.,
1988).
The skin of the hands mirrors the first signs of human
aging, and is reflected by an increase in skin permeability,
slow replacement of lipids leading to disturbed barrier function,
reduction of cutaneous vascular responsiveness and thinning
of the epidermis by 10–50% (Zouboulis and Makrantonaki,
2011). Skin permeability and barrier function are measured
by percutaneous absorption and transepidermal water loss
through the skin of the hand (Rougier et al., 1988). The
size of corneocytes is the main contributing factor for skin
permeability. In the elderly, the inward and outward movement
of water is correlated with corneocyte size. However, in younger
people, corneocyte surface area is low. Thus, percutaneous water
absorption and transepidermal water loss increases, but only
to a certain point (Rougier et al., 1987). At a surface area of

1,000 µm2, there is a limit to the percutaneous absorption or
transepidermal water loss. In previous studies of 65 to 80 years
olds, the surface area of corneocytes is found to be 20–25%
greater than for ages 45–55 years (Plewig, 1970; Rougier et al.,
1988).
Skin permeability, changes in corneocyte size and epidermal
cell turnover with age may be responsible for the left hand
volume changes seen in subjects above the age of 40 years.
Apart from corneocytes, the number of sebaceous glands at
a particular anatomic site may also influence absorption of
water (Blank and Scheuplein, 1969). Another route of water
absorption is the transfollicular route in the hands (Scheuplein,
1967). There is an inverse relationship between corneocyte
size and epidermal cell turnover. Epidermal cell proliferation
decreases with age, which could be another factor responsible
for the changes in permeability (Epstein and Maibach, 1965).
Specifically, epidermal cell turnover decreases by 30–50% in
the third and eighth decade of life (Baker and Blair, 1968;
Kligman, 1979). The change in epidermal cell proliferation and
keratinization manifests as altered structure and function of the
stratum corneum.
Changes in gravitational effects may also affect hand volume
changes. Gravity’s effects on blood circulation are less in water
compared to on land. On land, gravity pulls the blood flow toward
the hands and feet in the upright position. However, underwater,
the buoyant force of water takes over the functions of gravity
and the position of the body is no longer significant. Kraus and
colleagues find that by altering local blood pressure by changing
the position of the arm, hand volume is affected (Kraus et al.,
2013). The question remains if age-related changes in the hands
affect hand volume changes with water immersion.
Apart from the changes in skin structure, certain underlying
vascular changes also occur with age (Laurent, 2012). Arterial
stiffness may affect vascular compliance and decrease absorption
of water during hand immersion (Arnett et al., 1994). As early as
40 years, vascular changes may begin to manifest in the form of
progressive thickening of the arterial wall layers (intima/media
complex), leading to changes in vascular compliance (Arnett

et al., 1994). Vascular changes may also include reduction in the
number of cutaneous blood vessels, reduced vessel size, increased
leakiness of blood vessels and reduced forearm blood flow.
Reduction

and increased arterial stiffness could prevent clearance of
transdermally absorbed water from the dermis with aging
(Montagna and Carlisle, 1979). Aging is associated with
reduction in cutaneous vessel size and loss in vessel density
and surface area for exchange. Photoaging, characterized by
UV-induced erythema, also has a vascular response similar to
that of aged skin. Hence, although differences in hand volume
changes are likely related to changes in skin permeability
and slow vascular responsiveness, UV-associated aging of the
exposed hand should also be taken into consideration. On the
other hand, UV exposure also induces upregulation of VEGF
and downregulation of angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-
1 through MAPK activation in human skin and cultured
keratinocytes, leading to leaky vessels and hyperpermeability
(Kim et al., 2006). UV exposure third together with chemical
aging may be responsible for negative hand volume changes seen
by us in the older subjects.
The leakiness of the blood vessels increases with age, and this
may contribute to the difference in hand volume change seen in
subjects ≤40 and >40 years. Vascular endothelial dysfunction
is considered as the primary expression of normal human
aging. The capacity of endothelial cells to generate nitric oxide
(NO) reduces with age (Toda, 2012). Baseline flow mediated,
brachial arterial dilatation is also reduced in older subjects
compared to younger subjects (Gates et al., 2007). Although both
endothelium-dependent and -independent forearm vasodilation
are reduced with aging, diseases such as artherosclerosis induce
global vascular dysfunction. Reduction in NO with aging may
result in vasoconstriction and reduced uptake of water, although
we did not measure NO levels in our subjects. Thus, normal
and progressive vascular aging may be primarily responsible for
the difference in hand volume changes seen in the subjects of
different age groups. Hence, all of these factors should be taken
into consideration before establishing a standard hand volumeter
reading index for different age groups during the routine clinical
procedure of hand volume measurements.
Limitations
Although variables such as water temperature, equipment setup
and experiment time were diligently controlled, there are some
sources of variability that may limit interpretation of our
results. For example, the spill-over time, or drip rate, requires
standardization for consistency before measurements. Adding
3% ethanol solution reduces this issue and provides a more
consistent measurement of hand volume (Hargens et al., 2014).
In addition, the hands of participants must be relatively still
to get consistent results. Therefore, this method cannot be
used in people with paralysis or Parkinson’s disease or diseases
in which the hands tremble. Furthermore, skin lesions and
open wounds on hands can interfere with the hand volume
results.
