 Design—2-group, parallel, randomized trial stratified by initial weight loss (<10 kg vs. ≥10 kg), 
conducted from 20 August 2012 to 18 December 2015. Outcome assessors were blinded to 
treatment assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01357551)
Setting—3 primary care clinics at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Durham and Raleigh, 
North Carolina.
Patients—Obese outpatients (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2) who lost 4 kg or more of body weight 
during a 16-week, group-based weight loss program.
Intervention—The maintenance intervention, delivered primarily by telephone, addressed 
satisfaction with outcomes, relapse-prevention planning, self-monitoring, and social support. 
Usual care involved no contact except for study measurements.
Measurements—Primary outcome was mean weight regain at week 56. Secondary outcomes 
included self-reported caloric intake, walking, and moderate physical activity.
Results—Of 504 patients in the initial program, 222 lost at least 4 kg of body weight and were 
randomly assigned to maintenance (n = 110) or usual care (n = 112). Retention was 85%. Most 
patients were middle-aged white men. Mean weight loss during initiation was 7.2 kg (SD, 3.1); 
mean weight at randomization was 103.6 kg (SD, 20.4). Estimated mean weight regain was 
statistically significantly lower in the intervention (0.75 kg) than the usual care (2.36 kg) group 
(estimated mean difference, 1.60 kg [95% CI, 0.07 to 3.13 kg]; P = 0.040). No statistically 
significant differences in secondary outcomes were seen at 56 weeks. No adverse events directly 
attributable to the intervention were observed.
Limitations—Results may not generalize to other settings or populations. Dietary intake and 
physical activity were self-reported. Duration was limited to 56 weeks.
Conclusion—An intervention focused on maintenance-specific strategies and delivered in a 
resource-conserving way modestly slowed the rate of weight regain in obese adults.
Interventions targeting dietary change, physical activity, and behavioral strategies yield 
clinically significant weight loss of at least 5% (1, 2). After this weight loss, most people 
tend to regain 1 to 2 kg per year, with faster rates of regain in the earlier years (3). To reduce 
weight regain, various strategies have been evaluated, including sequential dieting, meal 
replacements, medications, and behavioral approaches (4). Behavioral approaches help 
people learn and habitualize behaviors for navigating situations that might lead to lapses and 
relapse (5).
One behavioral approach is teaching patients maintenance-specific skills thought to differ 
from initiation-specific skills (6–8). Some trials evaluating maintenance skills did not have a 
specific weight loss requirement, so maintenance-specific skills could not be fully tested (9–
13). One notable exception is the WLM (Weight Loss Maintenance) trial, in which 
participants who lost at least 4 kg were randomly assigned to an Internet, a personal contact, 
or a self-directed maintenance intervention (14). Although the personal contact group had 
modestly less regain at 30 months than the other 2 groups, the intervention was resource 
intensive, involving monthly telephone calls and in-person visits every 4 months. Efficacious

 maintenance interventions are needed to help participants adopt maintenance-specific skills 
while being delivered in a resource-conserving way.
We evaluated the efficacy of a maintenance intervention compared with usual care among 
patients who lost at least 4 kg in a weight loss program. Our innovative maintenance 
intervention focused on cognitive and behavioral processes involved in weight loss 
maintenance and was designed to conserve resources by being delivered primarily by 
telephone with decreasing frequency of contact.
Methods
Design Overview
The design was a 2-group, parallel, randomized, controlled trial. Patients who lost at least 4 
kg during a 16-week weight loss program were randomly assigned 1:1 to the maintenance or 
usual care group. The primary hypothesis was the group difference in mean weight regain at 
week 56; all follow-up weight measurements were assessed by blinded personnel. The first 
patient gave informed consent on 20 August 2012; the last date of follow-up was 18 
December 2015. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of 
Durham Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center and Duke University Medical Center before 
data collection. Although body composition was specified in the protocol, these specific data 
from the bioelectric impedance scales were not entered into our database.
Setting
Participants were recruited from 3 primary care clinics at the VA Medical Center in Durham 
and Raleigh, North Carolina. Group sessions were held at the Duke Center for Living and 
comprised patients from the 3 VA clinics.
Eligibility Screening and Participants
The study was conducted in 6 cohorts, each recruited over 6 to 8 weeks. Eligibility for the 
weight loss initiation program was determined in a 3-step process involving an electronic 
medical record data pull, a screening telephone call, and an in-person screening visit. Details 
of screening procedures were reported and are available in the protocol (Supplement 1, 
available at Annals.org) (15). In brief, patients identified via the data pull were mailed a 
recruitment letter. Patients called study staff in response to the recruitment letters or flyers 
posted at the VA clinics, or study staff called patients referred by providers through a consult 
in the electronic medical record. Patients who passed the telephone screen were scheduled 
for an in-person visit to determine their final eligibility, and eligible patients provided 
written informed consent. To be included in the study, patients had to be aged 18 to 75 years, 
have a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater, have a primary care provider, agree to 
attend visits, and have access to a telephone and reliable transportation. Exclusion criteria 
included liver disease; type 1 diabetes; most recent hemoglobin A1c in past 6 months 12% or 
greater; average systolic blood pressure over the past year and most recent blood pressure 
160 mm Hg or greater; history of weight loss surgery; dementia, severe psychiatric illness, 
or substance abuse; weight loss of 10 lb or more in the previous 3 months; current 
enrollment in a lifestyle program; current weight loss medication; pregnancy or plans to

 become pregnant in the next 6 months; breastfeeding; lack of birth control if premenopausal; 
organ transplant recipient; heart issues in the past 3 months; cancer not in remission; 
pacemaker or defibrillator (because of the use of a bio-electronic impedance scale); 
emotional problems that would impede intervention adherence or interacting in a group 
environment; and inability to stand for measurements. Eligible patients were offered up to 6 
group meeting times and chose one that they would attend every 2 weeks for 16 weeks (8 
sessions total).
The weight loss program was an abbreviated version of a previous protocol that focused on 
calorie and fat restriction (16). It included education and strategies for behavior initiation as 
outlined in our theoretical model, including goal setting and self-monitoring of dietary 
intake and physical activity. Weight loss of 4 kg or more during this program was the final 
eligibility criterion for randomization; thus, recording of weight within 1 week of the first 
scheduled group visit (week −16) and at the end of the weight loss initiation intervention 
(week 0) was required for patients to be considered for random assignment. A uniform 4-kg 
criterion was used because it is clinically significant for the average participant (17) and was 
used in a previous weight loss maintenance trial (14).
Randomization and Interventions
Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to maintenance intervention or usual care within initial 
weight loss strata (<10 kg vs. ≥10 kg) in block sizes of 4. The randomization scheme was 
generated via a uniform random-number generator and loaded into a tracking database. It 
could be accessed only by the study statistician or information technology personnel. Either 
the study’s registered dietitian or the project coordinator randomly assigned the participants 
by using the tracking database, and participants were given their assignment by telephone 
within 1 week after their week-0 visit. Intervention participants were asked to return at week 
2 for the first maintenance group session, whereas usual care participants were scheduled for 
the follow-up visit at week 14. The first participant was randomly assigned on 31 January 
2013.
The maintenance intervention involved transitions from initiation to maintenance skills and 
from group visits to individual telephone calls, as well as decreased frequency of contact 
(18). The intervention period was 42 weeks, followed by 14 weeks of no contact. Group 
visits occurred at weeks 2, 6, and 10. Individual telephone calls were made at weeks 4, 8, 12, 
16, 20, 24, 32, and 40. Group sessions addressed maintenance caloric intake, weight self-
monitoring, increasing and maintaining physical activity, obtaining social support from 
friends and family, and relapse prevention. All calls had a uniform structure that focused on 
4 maintenance constructs outlined in our theoretical model and were deemed acceptable in a 
pilot test: satisfaction with outcomes, relapse-prevention planning, self-monitoring, and 
social support (19). To make salient satisfaction with outcomes, participants reviewed 
“before” and “after” photographs and were asked to discuss outcomes of weight loss that 
continued to motivate them. They then identified high-risk situations in which relapse might 
occur and developed a plan to navigate those situations. Next, they specified a frequency of 
self-weighing and used a 1.36-kg (3-lb) regain relapse threshold. If relapse occurred, the 
registered dietitian guided the patient to reinitiate and self-monitor his or her diet or physical

 activity. Finally, participants identified a primary support person and supportive behaviors 
and were encouraged to share their plans with their support person.
The group sessions and telephone calls were delivered by 1 of 2 registered dieticians. 
Training included a review of theoretical principles and calls with mock participants, with 
feedback from the investigators. A co-investigator attended each group session and used a 
fidelity checklist to ensure that all protocoled elements were addressed. All maintenance 
telephone calls were recorded. Each week, the principal investigator, at least 1 co-
investigator, and the registered dietitians met for 1 hour to review randomly selected 
intervention calls, and the investigators completed fidelity checklists and provided feedback.
Usual care was chosen as the comparator to mimic the typical patient experience of no 
further intervention after participating in a weight loss program. The VA’s MOVE! clinical 
weight loss program (20) was not used as a comparator because it focuses on weight loss. 
MOVE! and referral to a nutritionist were available as part of usual care. Participants in the 
intervention group were asked not to enroll in MOVE! or other lifestyle programs or to 
consult a nutritionist during the intervention, whereas usual care participants were told they 
could do both. In a post hoc chart review, we determined that 2 participants randomly 
assigned to usual care and 3 to the intervention group attended a MOVE! orientation visit 
but had no further involvement in the program during the 56-week maintenance phase.
Outcomes and Follow-up
All participants were scheduled for assessment appointments at weeks 0, 14, 26, 42, and 56 
(weight loss initiation occurred at week −16 to week 0). All measurements were conducted 
by a research associate blinded to group assignment. Participants received $20 for the first 4 
visits and $40 for the assessment at week 56.
Weight was assessed at weeks 0, 14, 26, 42, and 56, with week 0 as the initial weight and 
mean weight regain at week 56 as the primary end point. Weight was measured on a 
calibrated digital scale, with patients wearing light clothing and no shoes. Height, recorded 
to enable calculation of BMI, was assessed with a stadiometer. Weight and height were 
double-entered into an electronic case report form. Waist circumference was measured at 
weeks 0, 26, and 56 by using a nonelastic tape measure placed on the skin in a horizontal 
plane around the abdomen at the level of the umbilicus.
Dietary intake was evaluated with the Block Brief 2000 food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) 
with a 3-month recall period at weeks 0, 26, and 56. Participants completed the FFQ either 
in person or at home and returned it by mail. We analyzed estimated total daily energy intake 
(in kilocalories) because this corresponded to the intervention. Daily physical activity was 
assessed by using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire 
(IPAQ). We focused on weekly metabolic minutes of walking and moderate physical activity 
because they were emphasized in our intervention.
Veterans Affairs expenditures for admissions and outpatient visits for the 392-day period 
after the week-0 weight date were determined by inpatient and outpatient VA claims files

 maintained in the Corporate Data Warehouse. Expenditures were inflation-adjusted to 2016 
dollars.
During the in-person screening visit, self-reported race, ethnicity, sex, education, current 
tobacco use, and previous weight loss attempt were assessed. Age was calculated from self-
reported birth date. At weeks 0, 26, and 56, additional constructs were assessed that relate to 
our theoretical model (Supplement 1) but are not reported here.
Adverse events were reported by participants to a team member during intervention contacts 
or outcome assessments rather than being assessed systematically. Details and dates of 
protocol amendments and quality control procedures are described in Supplement 1.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size estimate was based on the hypothesis that patients randomly assigned to 
receive the maintenance intervention would have less mean weight regain at week 56 than 
those assigned to usual care (21, 22). From a previous study (23), the SD at week 0 was 
estimated as 24.6 kg, the correlation between weeks 0 and 56 as 0.95, and the dropout rate at 
week 56 as 10%. To detect a difference of 3.5 kg with 90% power and a type I error rate of 
5%, we determined that 230 randomly assigned patients (115 in each group) were needed. 
This effect size represents approximately a 3% difference between groups, which is the 
lower threshold for clinically significant weight reduction (17).
For the primary analysis of weight, we used a general linear model with an unstructured 
covariance to account for the correlation of patients’ repeated measurements over time (by 
using PROC MIXED in SAS, version 9.4 [SAS Institute]). The outcome variable in this 
model was the study-measured weight (in kilograms) at weeks 0, 14, 26, 42, and 56. Model 
parameters included a common intercept (which constrains the baseline means to be equal); 
initial weight loss stratum (centered); indicator variables for weeks 14, 26, 42, and 56; and 
indicators for the maintenance intervention interacted with each follow-up time point 
indicator variable (24). Contrast statements were used to estimate the difference between the 
groups in weight regain from week 0 and each follow-up. The primary hypothesis was tested 
by examining the estimated difference in mean weight regain at week 56, 95% CI, and P 
value. In a post hoc sensitivity analysis, the assumption of equal mean weights at baseline 
was dropped.
Between-group differences in mean energy intake (kilocalories) at weeks 26 and 56 also 
were estimated and tested via a general linear model (PROC MIXED) with unstructured 
covariance. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs comparing the weekly number of 
metabolic minutes of walking and moderate physical activity between groups at weeks 26 
and 56 were estimated by using generalized linear mixed models under a negative binomial 
distribution with a log link (PROC GLIMMIX) to account for overdispersion (25); 
correlation of patients’ repeated measures over time was accounted for with a random 
intercept. Model parameters for the mean energy and physical activity models included a 
common intercept, initial weight loss stratum (centered), indicator variables for weeks 26 
and 56, and interaction of the maintenance intervention with the indicator variables for 
weeks 26 and 56 (see Supplement 2 [available at Annals.org] for the SAS code).

 All available data, including information from participants who subsequently discontinued 
the study, were used for analyses. Primary and secondary outcome analyses were conducted 
with full likelihood methods, which are valid under a missing-data framework in which the 
missing values may depend on intervention group, initial weight loss stratum, and any 
observed outcome values (26). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis in which additional 
predictors of missing weight values at week 56 were explored and included in a multiple 
imputation model (predictors are listed in the Supplement 2). Ten multiple imputations for 
week-56 weights were generated via the MCMC option in PROC MI and analyzed with a 
general linear model including only parameters for a common intercept, initial weight loss 
stratum (centered), week-56 indicator variable, and interaction of the maintenance 
intervention with the week-56 indicator variable. The model estimates were combined by 
using PROC MIANALYZE (SAS, version 9.4). Following the recommendations of 
MacLean and colleagues (3), we conducted post hoc analyses with the multiply imputed 
weights at week 56 to derive the percentage of patients whose weights at week 56 remained 
at least 5% lower than those at week −16, and the change in weight from weeks 0 to 56 as a 
percentage of weight at week 0 and weight lost during the initiation phase. The values 
presented for these post hoc analyses were averaged across the 10 imputed data sets.
Between-group differences in mean and median VA total expenditures for the 56-week 
maintenance phase were examined via t tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, respectively. 
Labor and capital costs for delivering the intervention also were calculated. Capital costs 
were estimated from market rates, and labor costs were calculated as the product of the time 
reported on the interventionists’ activity logs and their hourly wages, obtained from 
information in the General Schedule salary table for Durham, North Carolina. Because a VA 
payer perspective was taken, only VA costs were calculated.
Role of the Funding Source
The study was funded by the Health Services Research and Development service of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, which did not have a role in study design, execution, 
statistical analysis, manuscript preparation or interpretation, or the decision to submit this 
paper for publication.
Results
Participants and Intervention Adherence
As shown in the Appendix Figure, 1130 participants called in response to recruitment letters, 
flyers, or recommendations from their providers. Of those, 685 were scheduled for in-person 
screening, after which 573 were eligible and scheduled for a weight loss group meeting. Of 
the eligible patients, 69 did not initiate (that is, provide a weight at week −16). Of the 504 
participants who initiated, 82 participated in the program but lost insufficient weight, 200 
did not return for outcome assessments, and 222 participated in the program and lost enough 
weight to be randomly assigned to a group (110 to maintenance intervention and 112 to 
usual care).

 Randomly assigned participants lost an average of 7.2 kg during initiation; at randomization, 
their mean weight was 103.6 kg and mean BMI was 34.0 kg/m2 (Table). Most patients were 
middle-aged (mean, 62 years), white (58%), male (84%), high school graduates (98%), and 
retired (56%) and had attempted weight loss previously (82%). Self-reported dietary intake 
and physical activity at week 0 are reported in the Table.
Patients in the intervention group attended 0 to 3 maintenance meetings (mean, 2.07 [SD, 
1.06]) and participated in 2 to 8 telephone calls (mean, 7.34 [SD, 1.43]). Retention for 
week-56 assessments in the usual care and maintenance groups was 90% and 80% for 
weight (Figure 1), 78% and 76% for FFQ, and 89% and 79% for IPAQ, respectively. The 
median length of follow-up was 397.0 days (interquartile range, 381.5 to 407.0) in the usual 
care and 391.5 days (interquartile range, 351.0 to 404.0) in the intervention group. No 
crossover of assignments occurred. One patient in the usual care group died of meningioma. 
Reported adverse events were knee pain (n = 1), low blood pressure (n = 1), bradycardia (n = 
1), and anxiety (n = 1) in the intervention group, and heart failure (n = 2) and myocardial 
infarction (n = 1) among patients not randomly assigned.
Primary Outcome
Estimated mean weight loss at each time point is shown in Figure 2. Estimated weight regain 
was statistically significantly lower in the intervention (0.75 kg) than the usual care (2.36 
kg) group (estimated mean difference, 1.60 kg [95% CI, 0.07 to 3.13 kg]; P = 0.040) at the 
primary end point of 56 weeks and at week 42 (estimated mean difference, 1.67 kg [CI, 0.18 
to 3.17 kg]; P = 0.029) (Figure 2). Dropping the assumption of equal baseline weights did 
not meaningfully change the results (estimated mean weight regain, 1.59 kg [CI, 0.07 to 3.11 
kg]; P = 0.040). Results of the analysis on the multiply imputed weight data were similar to 
the model only on observed data (estimated mean difference at 56 weeks, 1.65 kg [CI, 0.10 
to 3.19 kg]; P = 0.036). Using individuals’ multiply imputed weight values at week 56, we 
conducted several post hoc descriptive analyses. Estimated weight regain from weeks 0 to 56 
as a percentage of week 0 weight was 0.8% and 2.4% for the maintenance and usual care 
groups, respectively. Estimated weight regain from weeks 0 to 56 as a percentage of weight 
loss during initiation was 14.6% and 41.9% for the maintenance and usual care groups, 
respectively. Finally, weights at week 56 were at least 5% lower (about 5.5 kg) than those at 
baseline before the weight loss initiation phase (week −16) for 57.8% of maintenance group 
participants, compared with 34.3% of those receiving usual care.
Secondary Outcomes
A statistically significant difference in self-reported energy intake (kilocalories) was noted 
between the maintenance (estimated mean, 1176.06 kcal) and usual care (estimated mean, 
1399.50 kcal) groups at week 26 (estimated mean difference, −223.44 kcal [CI, −395.92 to 
−50.96 kcal]; P = 0.011). However, the between-group difference was no longer statistically 
significant at 56 weeks (estimated mean, 1226.84 kcal for maintenance and 1352.34 kcal for 
usual care; estimated mean difference, −125.49 kcal [CI, −280.71 to 29.72 kcal]; P = 0.112). 
No differences were seen in estimated rates of walking or moderate physical activity 
between the maintenance and usual care groups at week 26 (walking IRR, 1.38 [CI, 0.85 to 
2.23; P = 0.19]; moderate physical activity IRR, 1.01 [CI, 0.54 to 1.90; P = 0.96]) or week

 56 (walking IRR, 1.03 [CI, 0.63 to 1.68; P = 0.91]; moderate physical activity IRR, 1.07 [CI, 
0.57 to 2.03; P = 0.83]). No between-group differences were noted in estimated waist 
circumference at week 26 (estimated mean difference, −0.36 in [CI, −1.03 to 0.30 in]; P = 
0.28) or week 56 (estimated mean difference, −0.55 in [CI, −1.32 to 0.21]; P = 0.153).
Intervention Cost and Health Care Expenditures
Intervention costs were $88.58 and $276.19 per participant for the initiation and 
maintenance interventions, respectively. No differences were seen in mean and median VA 
total expenditures by group during the 56-week maintenance phase (mean, $11 932 [SD, $20 
714] in the maintenance group and $14 876 [SD, $32 795] in the usual care group [P = 
0.42]; median, $4292 [interquartile range, $13 429] in the maintenance group and $5584 
[interquartile range, $11 438] in the usual care group [P = 0.37]).
Discussion
Despite the efficacy of behavioral weight loss initiation programs, maintenance has 
remained the holy grail of weight loss research. Our study provides evidence that focusing 
on maintenance-specific skills may help people maintain much of their initial weight loss 56 
weeks later. Participants maintained their weight even though the intervention decreased in 
frequency, shifted from in-person to telephone delivery, and involved no intervention contact 
in the final 14 weeks.
We compare our findings to those of other maintenance trials identified in an English-
language PubMed search in November 2016 (6, 10–14, 27–29). The trial most similar in 
design was the WLM trial, in which patients who lost at least 4 kg in a 6-month weight loss 
phase were randomly assigned to an Internet, a personal contact, or a self-directed 
maintenance intervention (14). At 12 months (the time point that aligned most closely with 
our primary end point of 56 weeks), the treatment difference between the personal contacts 
and self-directed interventions was 1.6 kg. Our treatment difference was identical despite 
notable distinctions in our study, including a shorter initial weight loss phase, a larger 
proportion of male participants, and a lower rate of patient eligibility after the weight loss 
initiation phase (44% in our trial vs. 61% in WLM). Our treatment difference is similar in 
magnitude to that of trials that had different designs (such as those involving participants 
who had lost weight before enrollment and thus varied in recency of weight loss and level of 
dietary education and skills [6, 13]), tested maintenance interventions of different content, 
often involved in-person delivery, and involved more frequent contact (6, 13, 27, 28).
One would expect to see the differences in weight regain reflected in secondary measures of 
caloric intake and physical activity. The lack of statistically significant differences in our 
secondary outcomes at week 56 may be the result of measurement error due to the limited 
reliability and validity of self-report measures of dietary intake and physical activity. In 
addition, participants’ behavioral plans for maintaining weight loss varied in whether they 
focused on maintaining a constant dietary pattern or incorporating physical activity, which 
may have masked treatment differences in the 2 behaviors.

 Another limitation to our study was the relatively short duration of intervention and follow-
up determined by our funding mechanism. In addition, generalizability is limited because 
initiation of the weight loss program was lower among people who were younger, lacked a 
support person, and had less encouragement for making dietary changes (15). Furthermore, 
compared with participants who lost enough weight in the initial weight loss phase, dropout 
in the initial phase was more likely among younger participants and tobacco users, and 
weight loss less than 4 kg was greater among nonwhite participants and was associated with 
greater controlled (extrinsic) motivation for physical activity. Generalizability might be 
enhanced by developing strategies to promote initiation and retention among these 
subgroups.
Strengths of our study include the use of a strong efficacy design (3), a high retention rate, 
the use of a conceptual model to inform the intervention, and regular fidelity assessments. In 
addition, our intervention was designed with implementation in mind. Its script is 
standardized so that it can be programmed into a custom software package and store 
participant responses for future reference. Although the protocol focuses on maintenance, it 
allows participants to refocus on weight loss initiation processes if a weight regain threshold 
is surpassed. The intervention also was designed to be low cost so that more resources could 
be devoted to initial weight loss relative to maintenance. Studies have underscored the 
superiority of in-person, group-based initiation intervention delivered at least twice per 
month compared with less intense intervention delivered by other methods, as reflected in 
the current obesity guideline (17) and coverage of weight loss treatment by the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services. Our maintenance intervention was delivered primarily by 
telephone, with decreasing frequency of contact.
In conclusion, a low-cost intervention focusing on maintenance constructs modestly reduced 
weight regain. Future research may extend the duration of intervention or follow-up to 
evaluate the durability of treatment effects. Electronic medical record data might be used to 
evaluate longer-term effects in the absence of further intervention. Future research should 
evaluate whether other behavior maintenance strategies would improve weight maintenance 
further. Additional efforts also might determine optimal implementation strategies for 
incorporating efficacious weight maintenance interventions into clinical programs, such as 
identifying an appropriate referral process, addressing barriers to initiation and retention in a 
comprehensive weight management program, and identifying optimal staff training and 
fidelity monitoring processes. By incorporating a weight maintenance intervention into 
clinical or commercial weight loss programs, the effect of efficacious weight loss programs 
may be increased.

MAINTAIN study phase 2 patient flow (weight loss maintenance).
MAINTAIN = Maintenance After Initiation of Nutrition Training. Detailed inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for phase 2 (randomized clinical trial) of the MAINTAIN study are 
described in the Methods section and the Appendix Figure (available at Annals.org). In 
brief, patients included in the study were aged 18 to 75 years with a body mass index ≥30 
kg/m2. Patients whose weight could or should not be measured with a bioelectric impedance 
scale and women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded. In addition, patients 
with a history of any of the following were excluded: kidney or liver disease, type 1 
diabetes, elevated systolic blood pressure, surgical or recent behavioral or pharmaceutical 
weight loss attempts, mental health or substance abuse issues, recently treated heart disease, 
cancer not in remission, or receipt of an organ transplant.

 Figure 2. 
Model-estimated weights, differences in weights, and associated 95% CIs, by treatment 
group and week.
Bars are 95% CIs. Weight estimates for each time point were calculated by using a general 
linear model with an unstructured covariance to account for the correlation of patients’ 
repeated measurements over time. Model parameters included a common intercept (which 
constrained the baseline means to be equal); initial weight loss stratum (centered); indicator 
variables for weeks 14, 26, 42, and 56; and indicators for the maintenance intervention 
interacted with each follow-up time point indicator variable. Contrast statements were used 
to estimate the difference between the groups in weight regain from week 0 to each of the 4 
follow-up time points. The model-estimated weight correlation between time points ranged 
from 0.99 (weeks 0 and 14) to 0.97 (weeks 0 and 56). NA = not applicable (because the 
model constrained the baseline means to be equal).

hemoglobin A1c value in the past 6 mo ≥12%; average systolic blood pressure over the past 
year ≥160 mm Hg and most recent blood pressure reading ≥160 mm Hg; and history of 
weight loss surgery, dementia, severe psychiatric illness, or substance abuse.
† 10 807 patients were mailed letters; 38 were mailed letters as well as being self-referred; 
239 were self-referred, with no letter sent.
‡ Obtained by subtraction.
§ Potential reasons for ineligibility assessed by telephone included BMI ≥29 kg/m2 based on 
self-reported weight and height (reduced threshold to allow for error in reporting); self-
reported age <18 or >75 y; weight loss ≥10 lb in the previous 3 mo; current enrollment in a 
lifestyle program; history of weight loss surgery; current use of weight loss medication or 
appetite suppressant; pregnancy or plan to become pregnant in upcoming 6 mo, 
breastfeeding, or lack of birth control if premenopausal (female); organ transplant recipient; 
type 1 diabetes; heart disease with new treatment in past 3 mo; liver disease; cancer not in

scale); major depression or emotional problems that would prevent the participant from 
following a diet closely or interacting with others in a group environment; illicit drug use or 
alcohol problems in the past year; inability to stand for study measurements; lack of desire 
to lose weight; lack of agreement to attend study visits; and no access to telephone or 
reliable transportation.
|| Two of the 267 patients ineligible at phone screen (1 because of BMI and 1 because of age) 
are included in both the “Scheduled for in-person consent and screening” and “In-person 
consent and screening” boxes. One was ineligible at phone screen because of BMI <30 
kg/m2 but then was erroneously rescreened in person and excluded at that point for the same 
reason. The other patient was listed as excluded because of age >75 y at both phone and in-
person screen. Both exclusions were erroneous because the patient was aged 75 y at both 
time points; however, the patient was not included in the study after the in-person screen.
