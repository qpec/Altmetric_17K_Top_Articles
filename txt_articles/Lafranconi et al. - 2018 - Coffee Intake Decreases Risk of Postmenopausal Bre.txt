Abstract: Aim: A dose-response meta-analysis was conducted in order to summarize the evidence
from prospective cohort studies regarding the association between coffee intake and breast cancer
risk. Methods: A systematic search was performed in electronic databases up to March 2017 to
identify relevant studies; risk estimates were retrieved from the studies and linear and non-linear
dose-response analysis modelled by restricted cubic splines was conducted. A stratified and subgroup
analysis by menopausal and estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status, smoking status and
body mass index (BMI) were performed in order to detect potential confounders. Results: A total of
21 prospective studies were selected either for dose-response, the highest versus lowest category of
consumption or subgroup analysis. The dose-response analysis of 13 prospective studies showed
no significant association between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk in the non-linear
model. However, an inverse relationship has been found when the analysis was restricted to
post-menopausal women. Consumption of four cups of coffee per day was associated with a 10%
reduction in postmenopausal cancer risk (relative risk, RR 0.90; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.82 to
0.99). Subgroup analyses showed consistent results for all potential confounding factors examined.
Conclusions: Findings from this meta-analysis may support the hypothesis that coffee consumption
is associated with decreased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.

1. Introduction
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and among the leading causes of cancer
death among females [1–3]. Worldwide and European estimates of women with a diagnosis of
breast cancer occurring in the last 5 years were over 6.2 and 1.8 million, respectively, in 2012 [4].
Significant improvements in early diagnosis and treatment have led to decreased mortality in the last

two decades [5,6]. However, evaluating potential risk factors and improving preventive actions is
needed in order to decrease the global burden of such disease.
A recent summary of scientific literature provided insightful the evidence of the potential
benefits of coffee on human health [7]. Most of evidence relied on observational prospective cohort
studies, suggesting that moderate-to-high coffee can be overall associated with lower risk of all-cause,
cardiovascular and cancer mortality compared to lower consumption [8]. These protective effects are
likely to be mediated by coffee active compounds, including but not limited to, coffee polyphenols,
which have been shown to have anti-diabetic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity
properties [9–11]. Among others, coffee consumption has been hypothesized to affect the risk of
female cancers (breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers) and particularity the risk of breast cancer in
post-menopausal women. A recent analysis of dietary patterns of women participating in the Nurses’
Health Study II pointed out that a low intake of green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables and
coffee during adolescence and early adulthood may increase the incidence of premenopausal breast
cancer, thus posing the basis for further research on long-term associations and cumulative effects [12].
Previous quantitative evidence syntheses on breast cancer risk often reported contrasting results,
either when assessing the risk estimates for extreme categories of consumption and in a dose-response
manner [13–17]. For instance, the meta-analysis carried out by Li and colleagues—on 16 cohort
and 10 case-control studies—found a borderline significant association (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93–1.00)
when comparing highest versus lowest coffee consumption; results limited to cohort studies were
not significant. Interestingly, a significant inverse association between coffee drinking and breast
cancer risk was documented in women without oestrogen receptor (ER-negative subgroup) [18].
Similarly, Jiang and colleagues analysed 20 case-control and 17 cohort studies and reported a borderline
association with breast cancer risk of the highest coffee consumption category compared to the lowest
(RR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.93–1.00); yet, a significant inverse association was present in postmenopausal
women and in women with breast related cancer antigen 1 (BRCA1) mutations (the latter being
highlighted as strong association) [19]. Therefore, coffee consumption might have a protective role for
specific subgroups of individuals (i.e., based on receptor and menopausal status) [18,19]; Since the latest
meta-analyses from Jing et al. and Li et al., several new prospective studies have been published on the
association between coffee intake and breast cancer. Thus, the aim of this study was to update current
evidence on the association between coffee consumption and risk of breast cancers, analysing results
obtained from prospective studies only, in order to summarize the evidence and provide new insights
on potential effect modification of putative confounding factors.
2. Methods
We followed Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) protocols
throughout preparing background, search strategy, methods and reporting the results, discussion and
conclusion of meta-analysis (Table S1).
2.1. Search Strategy
Articles were retrieved by searching two different electronic databases (PubMed (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and EMBASE (http://www.embase.com/) and were limited to publications in
English language between the earliest available online indexing year and March 2017. The following
search strategy based on the conjunction of the three terms: (i) coffee OR caffeine OR beverages
AND (ii) breast AND (iii) cancer OR carcinoma OR neoplasm (Table S2) was adopted. Titles and
abstracts of all identified studies were independently reviewed by two authors. Based on recent
guidelines proposed to draft the highest level of evidence in nutritional science [20], eligibility criteria
for study inclusion in the meta-analysis were based on the following criteria: (1) a prospective design;
(2) coffee consumption as the exposure of interest; (3) incidence of breast cancer as the outcome; (4) the
measure of association (relative risk or hazard ratio) with 95% confidence interval provided for 3 or
more quantitative categories of coffee consumption. Hand searching the reference lists of obtained
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 112
3 of 17
manuscripts was also performed to find additional studies not previously detected. In the case of
duplicated published cohorts, the one with the largest number of cases/entire cohort or with the
longest follow-up for endpoint of interest was included.
2.2. Data Extraction
Using a standardized extraction form, data were abstracted from all identified studies.
The following information was obtained from each article: (1) first author name; (2) year of publication;
(3) study cohort name; (4) country; (5) sex of participants; (6) age range of the study population at
baseline; (7) categories of coffee consumption; (8) type of coffee; (9) follow-up period; (10) distribution
of cases and person-years/number of participants, across categories of exposure; (11) relative risks
or hazard ratios, with 95% CIs for all categories of exposure; (12) covariates used in adjustments.
Extraction of data was conducted independently by two authors. Discrepancies were resolved through
a consensus discussion, The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used to assess the
quality of included studies [21].
2.3. Statistical Analysis
For the purpose of this meta-analysis, relative risks (RRs) or hazard ratios (HRs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for all categories of coffee consumption were extracted based on the most
fully adjusted models. Pooled effects were assessed by random-effect meta-analyses in which RRs
and HRs were treated as equivalent measure of risk [22] and the term of the relative risk refer to
both of them. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistic and the Cochran’s Q test. The I2 statistic
represented the amount of total variation that could be attributed to heterogeneity and its values ≤25%,
25–50%, 50–75% and >75% indicated no, small, moderate and significant heterogeneity, respectively.
The P values of Q test of less than 0.1 were accepted as statistically significant. The relationship
between coffee consumption and risk of breast cancer was firstly determined by highest versus lowest
analysis. The stability of the results was assessed through a sensitivity analysis in which one study
at a time was excluded. Potential confounders or effect modifiers and sources of heterogeneity were
verified in subgroup analysis and publication bias was tested visually by detecting asymmetry of
funnel plots.
Based on retrieved data (amount of exposure, distributions of cases and person-years or
number of participants and RRs/HRs with 95% CIs) for each category (at least three) of coffee
consumption, a dose-response meta-analysis was performed. Within the studies, the mean or median
intake, alternatively the midpoint of the range of intake of coffee consumption was assigned to
the corresponding RR/HR with the 95% CI. Right-unbounded highest categories of exposure were
assumed to have the same width as the adjacent one. Both linear and non-linear dose-response
relationship between coffee intake and risk of total and postmenopausal breast cancer was assessed by
random-effect meta-analysis performed in two stages. In the first stage, the generalized least-squares
(GLS) method reported by Greenland and Orsini was implemented and study-specific coefficients were
calculated based on retrieved data across categories of coffee consumption and taking into account
the intraclass (within study) correlation of RRs/HRs [23,24]. Non-linear dose-response analysis was
modelled by restricted cubic splines with 3 knots at fixed percentiles (25%, 50% and 75%) of the
distribution [25]. In the second step of the random-effect meta-analysis summary statistics from
each study were combined. The between-study variance in linear dose-response meta-analysis and
the between-study covariance matrices in non-linear dose-response meta-analysis was assessed by
DerSimonian and Laird estimator or multivariate extension of the method of moments, respectively.
P-value for non-linearity was calculated by testing the value of the coefficient of the second spline
of zero. All analyses were performed with R software version 3.0.3, to conduct dose-response
meta-analysis the package dosresmeta was used (Development Core Team, Lucent Technologies,
Vienna, Austria).

3.1. Study Characteristics
The systematic search identified 1724 studies, of which 1533 were excluded after reviewing the
title and 162 after reviewing the abstract (Figure 1). Of the 29 publications selected for evaluation
of full-text article, 8 were excluded for the following reasons: (1) article did not provide risk with
confidence intervals; (2) article did not have prospective design; (3) article provided data only on
genetic polymorphism; (4) article did not provide data for general population.
For the meta-analysis on the association between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk
21 studies were eligible [26–46]. Several cohorts, namely VIP (Västerbotten Intervention Programme),
NOWAC (Norwegian Women and Cancer), E3N (Etude Epidémiologique auprès de femmes de la
Mutuelle Générale de l’Education Nationale) and EPIC-NL (European Prospective Investigation into
Cancer and Nutrition—The Netherlands) [26,29,40,42] were excluded from the main analysis, as part
of theirs cases are included in the multicentre study EPIC [27]. However, an alternative analysis was
performed by including these cohorts and excluding EPIC study. Two articles were used only for
subgroup analysis [33,41]. Studies eligible for the main analysis comprised 1,068,098 participants and
36,597 breast cancer cases. Selected characteristics of the studies included in the meta-analysis are
described in Table 1. Eight studies provided relative risk for postmenopausal [27,28,30,31,33,37,43,45]
and for premenopausal status [27,28,32,37,41,43,45,46]. Seven studies were conducted in North
America [28,30–32,34,37,46], 6 in Europe [27,35,36,39,43,45] and 2 in Asia [38,44]. The follow-up
in prospective cohort studies ranged from about 5 to 26 years.

3.2. Summary Relative Risk for the High vs. Lowest Category of Coffee Consumption
The summary RR of breast cancer for highest vs. lowest category of coffee consumption was
RR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.00 with small heterogeneity I2 = 7%, p = 0.37 (Figure 2, Table 2); no publication
bias was found after visual inspection of funnel plot (Figure S1). Two studies [36,38] were at higher
risk of bias and provided very small heterogeneity to the overall analysis, despite no specific reasons
have been identified; we may hypothesize that quality of the data was not optimal since the studies
were not conducted specifically on coffee as variable of interest but this is only speculative and no data
can support this explanation. Since several cohorts (VIP, NOWAC, E3N, EPIC-NL) share the cases with
EPIC multicentre study an alternative analysis by excluding EPIC study and including the others was
performed. The summary RR of breast cancer for highest vs. lowest category of coffee consumption in
alternative analysis was RR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.00 with no evidence of heterogeneity I2 = 0%, P = 0.48;
indicating the stability of the results. In the stratified analysis, we found a significant inverse association
between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women (RR = 0.92, 95% CI:
0.88, 0.98 with no evidence of heterogeneity I2 = 0%, p = 0.57). Stratified analyses were carried out for
receptor status and BMI: none of them showed a significant association between coffee intake and
cancer risk; yet, similar point estimates and confidence intervals were found for the receptor-negative
group and for the overweight and obese group. Interestingly, results were not influenced by coffee
type (caffeinated versus decaffeinated), nor for time of follow-up. Adjusted analyses were carried out
for smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity and education, without evidence of effect modification.

risk of bias and provided very small heterogeneity to the overall analysis, despite no specific reasons 
have been identified; we may hypothesize that quality of the data was not optimal since the studies 
were not conducted specifically on coffee as variable of interest but this is only speculative and no 
data can support this explanation. Since several cohorts (VIP, NOWAC, E3N, EPIC-NL) share the 
cases with EPIC multicentre study an alternative analysis by excluding EPIC study and including the 
others was performed. The summary RR of breast cancer for highest vs. lowest category of coffee 
consumption in alternative analysis was RR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.00 with no evidence of 
heterogeneity I2 = 0%, P = 0.48; indicating the stability of the results. In the stratified analysis, we 
found a significant inverse association between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk among 
postmenopausal women (RR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.98 with no evidence of heterogeneity I2 = 0%, p = 
0.57). Stratified analyses were carried out for receptor status and BMI: none of them showed a 
significant association between coffee intake and cancer risk; yet, similar point estimates and 
confidence intervals were found for the receptor-negative group and for the overweight and obese 
group. Interestingly, results were not influenced by coffee type (caffeinated versus decaffeinated), 
nor for time of follow-up. Adjusted analyses were carried out for smoking, alcohol intake, physical 
activity and education, without evidence of effect modification.

3.3. Dose-Response Meta-Analysis
Thirteen studies [26,28,29,31,32,34,37–40,42,43,45] were eligible for dose-response meta-analysis
of prospective cohort studies on coffee consumption and breast cancer risk. Six studies [32,34,41–43,45]
provided risk estimates for postmenopausal woman only. In linear dose-response meta-analysis a
significant association between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk was found (Figure 3, Table 3).
Compared with no coffee consumption, the pooled relative risks for breast cancer were 0.99, 95% CI:
0.98, 1.00 for one cup/day, 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96, 0.99 for two cups/day, 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94, 0.99 for three
cups/day, 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93, 0.99 for four cups/day, 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.98 for five cups/day, 0.93,
95% CI: 0.89, 0.98 for six cups/day and 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.98 for seven cups/day. When taking into
account postmenopausal woman only, the association between coffee consumption and risk of breast
cancer was stronger.

4. Discussion
The present dose-response meta-analysis, which included 13 prospective studies and followed
over 1 million people, did not show a significant association between coffee consumption and overall
breast cancer risk in the non-linear model. However, an inverse relationship has been found when the
analysis was restricted to post-menopausal women (RR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88–0.98).
The meta-analysis performed by Li and colleagues [18], on 16 cohort and 10 case-control studies,
showed a borderline significant inverse association between coffee intake and the risk of breast cancer
(RR: 0.96, CI 95%: 0.93–1.00 for highest versus lowest analysis; RR: 0.98, CI 95%: 0.97–1.00 for an
increment of 2 cups per day). Statistical significance was reached only for those women without
oestrogen receptor (ER-negative, RR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67–0.97). In our study, such finding was not
confirmed. The work carried out by Jiang and colleagues [19], which included 17 prospective and
20 case-control studies, found no significant association between coffee consumption and breast
cancer risk (highest versus lowest analysis: RR: 0.98, CI 95% 0.95–1.02; dose-response analysis: RR:
0.98, 95% CI: 0.92–1.05 for an increment of 2 cups per day). Such relationship became significant
for post-menopausal women, with a stronger inverse relationship for those with BRCA1 mutation.
Overall results are mostly confirmed in our meta-analysis, even though we included a higher
number of individuals and performed alternative analyses to avoid overlap of cohorts. However,
while our analysis confirmed a statistically significant relationship between coffee intake and breast
cancer in post-menopausal women, we were not able to draw insights on the role of BRCA status
(evidence derived from case-control studies, not eligible for our meta-analysis). Moreover, similarly to
our study, the meta-analysis of Jiang and colleagues differentiated the analysis according to follow-up
duration and found similar results between studies with long (>10) and short (<10 years) follow-up.
Several studies associated coffee consumption with health benefits, including decreased risk of
cancers (e.g., colorectal, endometrial and prostate cancers) [7,13,14]. Several compounds have been
considered responsible for such potential protective effects, including polyphenols (such as chlorogenic
acids), diterpens (such as cafestol and kahweol) but also melanoidins (generated during the roasting
process) and trigonelline [47–50]. Data from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that coffee could
interfere with different stages of the cancerous process, including induction of DNA damage caused by
pro-carcinogens and reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of proto-oncogenes and inactivation of
onco-suppressor genes, loss of apoptosis and growth control, induction of angiogenesis and consequent
metastatic process [11].
Our study revealed significant results for post-menopausal women. Several mechanisms have
been proposed to act specifically in the etiopathogenesis of female cancers: for instance, caffeine and
coffee intake have been inversely associated with free estradiol levels in premenopausal women,
either directly or indirectly (relationship mediated by the sex hormone-binding globulin-SHBG) [51–53].
SHBG, which is the major carriers of sex-steroids, lowers the circulating free levels of oestrogens and
the positive association between coffee intake and SHBG has been documented in post-menopausal
women as well [54]. Similarly, coffee has been associated with the inhibition of CYP19, or aromatase,
the enzyme converting androgens into oestrogens [51]. Circulating oestrogens are well-established
risk factors for breast cancer [55].
Despite the complexity of the described mechanisms, it is crucial to understand the pathways
through which coffee may decrease risk of cancer.
Our finding, showing a similar association
for caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee, may suggest a limited role of caffeine on breast cancer
risk (the literature highlights the role of caffeine on neurotransmitters, therefore on neurological,
cardiorespiratory and gastrointestinal diseases) [7]. It is therefore more plausible that the action
on carcinogenesis is mediated by other coffee compounds [11].
The beneficial effects may be
related to the antioxidant ability, as coffee is one of the major contributor to dietary antioxidant
intake worldwide [56,57]. However, based on the observational nature of the studies involved
in this research, we cannot rule out the possibility of existence of confounding factors or effect
modifiers that can indirectly explain the potential benefits of coffee toward breast cancer risk. For
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 112

instance, one of the stronger evidence regarding coffee consumption regards liver and, more generally,
metabolic health [58]. Several studies showed a better metabolic status occurring in individuals
characterized by high consumption of coffee [10,59–68]. We found no difference in the relationship
between coffee intake and breast cancer risk according to BMI; nevertheless, obesity is a well-recognized
risk factor for breast cancer and hormonal impairment consequent to excess body weight may be
inversely associated with consumption of coffee [69,70]. The metabolic syndrome, also known as
insulin resistance syndrome, is a multifactorial disease well related to breast cancer risk of incidence
and recurrence [71,72] with a crucial role in the activation of many endocrine and immune factors
linked to breast cancer cell proliferation, survival and chemo-resistance. Among different nutritional
approach aimed to revert metabolic syndrome in breast cancer patients, it was recently shown that
consumption of coffee in adults up to three cups a day reduces the risk of type-2 diabetes, the metabolic
syndrome as well as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [58,73]. Several studies showed that
the association is rather stronger with the overall metabolic status than with individual components
of the syndrome [67,74]. A crucial endocrine role in breast cancer risk and progress may be related
to low levels of adiponectin (having anti-cancer effect) and high levels of leptin (having insulin and
IGF1-like effects in cancer cells) in the blood [75,76]; interestingly, in a cross-sectional study, it was
demonstrated that coffee consumption has a significant positive associations with adiponectin and
inverse associations with leptin as well as with the inflammatory marker high sensitivity C-reactive
protein (hs-CRP) indicating interesting endocrine and metabolic effects of coffee consumption [77].
In our study, we investigated the possible role of confounding factors in determining the
association between coffee consumption and breast cancer risk. It has been reported that smoking
status, education, physical activity and BMI, may cluster together with dietary choices that may affect
cancer risk (i.e., consumption of meat, fruit and vegetable) [78]. Besides BMI, for which some studies
provided specific RRs and we were able to perform the aforementioned stratified risk analysis, in our
study the results of studies grouped according to adjustment for specific variables, such as smoking
status, education and physical activity, did not weakened the results, rather they shortened CIs despite
yet not significant, suggesting that better designed cohort studies properly adjusting for potential
confounding factors may enhance the overall quality of comprehensive quantitative synthesis and
leading to significant results toward lower risk of breast cancer associated with higher consumption
of coffee.
Another indirect confounding effect may be related to alcohol consumption: alcohol is another
known risk factor for breast cancer through the alteration of biological pathways associated to
hormone levels, the production of carcinogens through metabolism of ethanol and the inhibition of the
one-carbon metabolism and nucleotide biosynthesis [79,80]. Some descriptive studies on beverage
drinking patterns suggest that increased coffee/tea consumption might be associated with alcohol
intake [81–86]. However, our results showed that studies adjusting for alcohol intake provided lower
risk estimates for the association between coffee and breast cancer risk, suggesting that adjustment for
such lifestyle factors is crucial when exploring the potential effects of coffee on health. Coffee drinking
has been associated with smoking habits, which in turn may exert detrimental effects on health [87];
in contrast, coffee might be a part of an overall healthier dietary pattern, which in turn might be
associated with lower risk of cancer due to a synergistic effect of several components rather than an
individual food or beverage [88]. More in-depth studies with further evaluation of genetic parameters
are ongoing but additional research is needed to conclude a causal relation between coffee consumption
and risk of cancer.
Besides the aforementioned limitations related to the original design of the studies included in this
meta-analysis, the presented results should be considered in light of some other limitations. No data
on methods of preparation have been provided in the studies, leading to possible heterogeneity of
results due to differences in quantity and quality of bioactive compounds [89]. Finally, due to the
observational nature of the studies included in the meta-analysis we cannot exclude the possibility of
recall bias and reverse causation.

5. Conclusions
In conclusion, overall we observed no significant association between coffee intake and breast
cancer risk but coffee consumption may represent a protective factor for post-menopausal breast cancer
risk. Further evidences taking into account population subsets and specific strata are extremely needed
to corroborate the retrieved associations.
