Abstract
Background
Reductions in smoking in Arizona and California have been shown to be associated with
reduced per capita healthcare expenditures in these states compared to control populations
in the rest of the US. This paper extends that analysis to all states and estimates changes in
healthcare expenditure attributable to changes in aggregate measures of smoking behavior
in all states.
Methods and Findings
State per capita healthcare expenditure is modeled as a function of current smoking preva-
lence, mean cigarette consumption per smoker, other demographic and economic factors,
and cross-sectional time trends using a fixed effects panel data regression on annual time
series data for each the 50 states and the District of Columbia for the years 1992 through
2009. We found that 1% relative reductions in current smoking prevalence and mean packs
smoked per current smoker are associated with 0.118% (standard error [SE] 0.0259%, p <
0.001) and 0.108% (SE 0.0253%, p < 0.001) reductions in per capita healthcare expendi-
ture (elasticities). The results of this study are subject to the limitations of analysis of aggre-
gate observational data, particularly that a study of this nature that uses aggregate data and
a relatively small sample size cannot, by itself, establish a causal connection between
smoking behavior and healthcare costs. Historical regional variations in smoking behavior
(including those due to the effects of state tobacco control programs, smoking restrictions,
and differences in taxation) are associated with substantial differences in per capita health-
care expenditures across the United States. Those regions (and the states in them) that
have lower smoking have substantially lower medical costs. Likewise, those that have
higher smoking have higher medical costs. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that these results
are robust.

 Conclusions
Changes in healthcare expenditure appear quickly after changes in smoking behavior. A 10%
relative drop in smoking in every state is predicted to be followed by an expected $63 billion
reduction (in 2012 US dollars) in healthcare expenditure the next year. State and national poli-
cies that reduce smoking should be part of short term healthcare cost containment.
Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• There have been many estimates of the medical costs of smoking at both the national
and state levels, but these estimates do not capture the changes in health care expendi-
ture over time that are associated with changes in smoking behavior and the effects of
tobacco control programs.
• Estimates from California and Arizona have shown that medical savings accrue quickly
as the prevalence and intensity of smoking decreases, when adjusted for the history of
smoking reduction and tobacco control program activity in the United States.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• This study examined the year-to-year relationship between changes in smoking and
changes in medical costs for the entire United States, taking into account differences
between different states and historical national trends in smoking behavior and health-
care expenditures.
• The study found that 1% relative reductions in current smoking prevalence and mean
packs smoked per current smoker are associated with 0.118% and 0.108% reductions,
respectively, in per capita healthcare expenditure (elasticities).
• Historical regional variations in smoking behavior (including those due to the effects of
state tobacco control programs, smoking restrictions, and differences in cigarette taxa-
tion rates) are associated with substantial differences in per capita healthcare expendi-
tures across the United States.
• A 10% relative drop in smoking in every state is predicted to be followed by a $63 billion
reduction (in 2012 US dollars) in healthcare expenditure the next year.
What Do These Findings Mean?
• Changes in healthcare costs appear quickly after changes in smoking behavior.
• State and national policies that reduce smoking should be part of short term healthcare
cost containment.

 Introduction
Smoking causes a wide range of diseases, including cardiovascular and pulmonary disease,
complications of pregnancy, and cancers [1,2]. While the risks for some of these diseases, such
as cancer, evolve over a period of years when people start and stop smoking, the risks for other
diseases begin to change within days or months following changes in smoking behavior. For
example, the risk of heart attack and stroke fall by about half in the first year after smoking ces-
sation [3], and the risk of having a low birth weight infant due to smoking almost entirely dis-
appears if a pregnant woman quits smoking during the first trimester [4]. There is a substantial
literature showing that reductions in smoking behavior have substantial short and long run
health benefits that reduce real per capita healthcare expenditures, beginning with reductions
in cardiovascular disease, particularly heart attack and stroke [3], and respiratory disease [5].
Smoking cessation and reduction in secondhand smoke exposure in pregnant women, moth-
ers, and children produce both very short run and long run reductions in healthcare expendi-
tures [4,6]. The 2014 Surgeon General’s report The Health Consequences of Smoking—50 Years
of Progress ([1], pp. 435–443) summarized 59 studies that reported immediate (often within 1
mo) 10%–20% drops in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction, other cardiac
events, stroke, asthma, and other pulmonary events following implementation of smoke-free
laws. These benefits extend to the elderly population [7], complications of pregnancy [8], and
young children [8,9] and grow with time as the effects on slower-evolving diseases, such as can-
cer [10,11], emerge.
Previous research found that increases in per capita funding for population-based tobacco
control programs in California [12,13] and Arizona [14] were associated with reductions in
cigarette consumption and, in turn, with reductions in per capita healthcare expenditure in
those states compared to control populations in the rest of the United States. These studies
reached similar conclusions using two different aggregate measures of population smoking
behavior: (1) per capita cigarette consumption in California and Arizona [12,14] and (2) smok-
ing prevalence and cigarette consumption per smoker in California [13]. This paper extends
the second approach to estimate the link between smoking behavior and healthcare expendi-
ture for the entire United States.
Methods
This paper estimates how much on average a 1% relative reduction in smoking prevalence in a
US state reduces health costs in that state a year later. The analysis estimates this association
(elasticity) while controlling for the effects of a variety of other differences between states that
may produce a spurious association between reduction in smoking prevalence and reduced
health expenditure, e.g., changes in population composition and other health behaviors that
may also reduce health expenditure. To obtain this estimate for each state, we use a regression
approach, with various refinements that take account of correlated time series. In the main and
supplemental sensitivity analysis, we control—as much as possible when using state aggregated
data—for the effects of other variables that may influence health care expenditure at the state
level in addition to smoking (e.g., demographic factors, such as population age composition
and ethnic composition; other health risk behaviors in the population, such as alcohol use; and
obesity). We also control for the possible effects of unmeasured variables (e.g., cross-state ciga-
rette purchases) on the validity of the measure of cigarette consumption per smoker in each
state.
The dependent variable in the regression model (Fig 1) is real (inflation-adjusted) annual
per capita healthcare expenditure (including both public and private payers). The independent

modeled as a function of smoking behavior (current smoking prevalence and mean annual cigarette

measurement error that increases over the sample period due to increasing interstate tax differentials, the individual state
cigarette tax rates are included to adjust for the effects of this possible measurement error. Other state-specific control
variables that might affect per capita healthcare expenditure are included. To account for long run trends in healthcare
expenditure that are correlated with the observed state-specific explanatory variables as well other correlated but
unobserved trends, the national averages of the dependent and explanatory variables are included in the regression.
Finally, state-specific intercepts are included in the regression to model regional and state-specific factors that may affect

 (explanatory) variables include two state-specific measures of smoking behavior (prevalence of
current smoking and mean cigarette consumption per current smoker) as well as other state-
specific factors that could affect healthcare expenditure (real per capita income, proportion of
the population that is elderly, proportion of the population that is Hispanic, and proportion of
the population that is African-American). Finally, state-specific intercepts were included in the
regression to account for other factors that affect state healthcare expenditure that, while con-
stant over time, could differ across states.
Measures of smoking behavior, the other population factors we are considering, and health-
care costs change over time unpredictably because of changes in technology, access to care, and
the nature of the population itself. From a statistical perspective, that means that the underly-
ing process is nonstationary, and we need to account for this in the analysis. To do so, we also
include the national cross-sectional averages of the dependent and independent variables as
independent variables in the regression equation to account for their long run trends and
trends in other correlated but unobservable variables associated with per capita healthcare
expenditure that vary over the sample period [15–17]. Examples of overall national trends in
per capita healthcare expenditure that are difficult or impossible to measure include develop-
ments in medical technology and the economic, regulatory, legal, or legislative environment
that affect access to care and therefore utilization. Including the overall national trends as inde-
pendent variables means that the regression coefficients for the state-specific explanatory vari-
ables are interpreted as the effects of the variation of the state-specific variables around the
overall trends included in the model. For example, the coefficient of the prevalence of current
smoking in each state can be interpreted as the effect of the departure of prevalence of smoking
in that state from the overall national trend in prevalence of smoking on that state’s per capita
healthcare expenditure, after accounting for all the national trends included in the model.
There is also a possibility that the reported cigarette sales in a state (which we used to esti-
mate annual per smoker cigarette consumption) might not be equal to the numbers of ciga-
rettes smoked in a state. To adjust for possible measurement error in mean cigarette
consumption per smoker, state-specific cigarette tax rates are also included in the regression
model (Fig 1).
The independent variables are taken from the year before the healthcare expenditure data
(i.e., lagged by 1 y), to allow for time for the independent variables to affect healthcare
expenditure.
Data
The estimated effects of smoking on healthcare costs are based on cross-sectional time series
(panel) data on smoking, healthcare costs, and demographics for the 50 states and the District
of Columbia (considered and referred to hereafter as 51 “states”) for the years 1992 through
2009.
Healthcare expenditures.
The main results use the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) estimates of total (public and private payer) healthcare expenditure by state of
residence [18]. We chose the CMS state of residence measure because it measures healthcare
expenditures consumed by residents of each state, rather than the expenditure of healthcare
providers located in each state regardless of the state of the recipient. Previous research [12–
14] used aggregate state data for California or Arizona compared to an aggregate population
from many control states, and there was no practical or statistically significant difference in
state healthcare expenditure and that remain constant over the sample period. All the independent (explanatory)
variables are lagged by 1 y.

 regression results using the resident- and provider-based measures. State per capita healthcare
expenditure was calculated by dividing total real state expenditure by the state resident popula-
tion from the US Census Bureau.
Smoking behavior.
Prevalence of current smoking and state and federal cigarette tax data
were from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) provided by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation
(STATE) System [19]. State-specific per capita cigarette consumption and cigarette tax rates
were from the The Tax Burden on Tobacco [20] provided by the CDC STATE System [19]. Cig-
arette consumption per smoker was calculated by dividing per capita cigarette consumption
for each state’s resident population by current smoking prevalence from the US Census
Bureau.
Demographic control variables.
Total state resident population data and the proportion
of state resident population age 65 y or older were from the US Census Bureau [21–23]. The
proportion of the population that is Hispanic and African-American was calculated from the
BRFSS survey data [24]. The proportion of the population by race and ethnicity, used for sensi-
tivity analysis, was calculated from the BRFSS data [24] rather than census data because com-
plete data using consistent definitions were not available from the US Census Bureau over the
whole sample period, and the effects of the adjustments following the decadal census on the
annual census population estimates by race and ethnicity are so large that the estimates cannot
be used in regression analysis without introducing spurious results due to breaks in the model-
based trends across census years. State per capita personal income was taken from the US
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) regional economic accounts [25].
Adjusting for inflation.
All monetary values are expressed in year 2010 US dollars using
the regional medical care (for healthcare expenditures) and regional all-item (for cigarette
taxes and personal income) Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) [26].
Missing data.
There were up to 18 annual observations for the individual 51 states, mak-
ing 918 data points. There are only 27 missing data points (2.9%) because of individual states
not participating in the BRFSS in some years. All but three missing observations are due to
delayed entry of 11 states into the BRFSS or a BRFSS component. Fisher’s exact test and conti-
nuity-corrected Spearman’s and Kendall’s tau-a correlation coefficients were used to evaluate
the association between the presence and length of lagged state entry into BRFSS and each
state’s smoking behavior and socio-demographics used in the analysis, state population, and
geographic region. No statistically significant geographical or socio-demographic or economic
relationships were found to explain the patterns of delayed entry among the states, so we con-
sider the missing observations to be missing completely at random.
Model
The regression model explains state per capita healthcare expenditure as a function of state per
capita income, population age structure (proportion of the population that is elderly), propor-
tion of the population that is African-American, proportion of the population that is Hispanic,
and additional control variables that describe national trends in health care expenditure, such
as changes in medical technology and the market for health care. Other variables that may
affect the results were missing for some years and states, such as prevalence of insurance cover-
age and prevalence of other health risks (e.g., obesity and high blood pressure). A sensitivity
analysis (detailed in S1 Text, Sensitivity Analyses) to determine whether inclusion of these vari-
ables would change the estimates substantially was conducted on the available observations.
Previous research compared smoking behaviors and per capita healthcare expenditures in
California [12,13] and Arizona [14] to various control populations in the United States. Instead

 of selecting a distinct control population, this model uses the pooled common correlated effects
(CCE) fixed effects estimator [15–17] on annual time series data for each of 51 cross-sectional
units (the 51 states). The CCE fixed effects estimator uses the national cross-sectional averages
(the arithmetic average of the 51 state-specific values for each year) of the dependent and
explanatory variables to control for national trends in per capita healthcare expenditure, the
other explanatory variables, and any correlated but unobservable common trends.
The model used for these national estimates has two parts (Fig 1). The details of the model
appear in S1 Text (Detailed Description of the Model). The first part of the model is a first order
autoregression (i.e., a regression that uses explanatory variables that are lagged one period) that
models the effect of smoking behavior, adjusted for other explanatory variables, on state residen-
tial per capita healthcare expenditure. The first part of the model assumes that individual mean
state cigarette consumption per smoker is observed without measurement error.
The natural logarithm of state per capita healthcare expenditure in each state is explained
using the lagged natural logarithms of state smoking prevalence, mean cigarette consumption
per smoker, per capita income, and several demographic variables and the lagged natural loga-
rithms of their associated national averages across all the states. Using logarithms in this way
yields regression coefficients that are interpreted as elasticities, which are dimensionless con-
stants that give the percent change in the dependent variable associated with a 1% (relative)
change in each explanatory variable. The logarithmic transformation produced better behaved
residuals for individual state data than the linear specifications used in earlier work [12–14].
The second part of the model adds an adjustment for possible measurement error in indi-
vidual state observations of mean cigarette consumption per smoker due to untaxed cigarette
consumption induced by differences in state cigarette taxes. A state-specific model for this type
of measurement error (that would use different coefficients for each of the 51 states) led to
severe multicollinearity and model specification problems, so the eight BEA economic regions
were chosen as the most appropriate grouping for modeling variations in the effect of the indi-
vidual state-specific cigarette tax rates over time. In particular, we retained information on
individual state variation in cigarette tax rates while restricting the associated coefficients’ val-
ues regionally. The BEA regions were chosen for the regional pattern of cigarette tax adjust-
ment effects because the BEA regions reflect economically homogenous groups of states [27].
(The BEA regions are New England, Mideast, Great Lakes, Plains, Southeast, Southwest, Rocky
Mountain, and Far West; the component states are listed in the first table in S1 Text.) Each
individual state tax rate is assumed to have the same effect on unmeasured cigarette consump-
tion within each BEA region, but this effect was allowed to vary across BEA regions. The
implicit assumption used in choosing regional coefficients for the tax variables but not for
other variables is that regional characteristics that affect unmeasured consumption (such as
average size of state, distance from population centers to state borders, and cross-border com-
muting and other travel patterns) vary more by region than the relationship between the other
explanatory variables and healthcare expenditure. This assumption was relaxed in one of the
sensitivity analyses reported in S1 Text (Sensitivity Analyses).
Sensitivity Analysis
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to check the possibility that the estimates that attri-
bute changes in population health to smoking are related to other risk factors than smoking
(and secondhand smoke exposure). The results of these sensitivity analyses are summarized
below. Detailed results appear in S1 Text (Sensitivity Analyses).
Other health risk factors.
The prevalence of other health risk factors were measured in
the BRFSS surveys (prevalence of high blood pressure and high cholesterol among

 respondentswho had those checked, prevalence of abusive drinking, no insurance coverage, no
regular exercise, diabetes, and obesity), and these prevalence estimates were all added to the
final model (Table 1), both singly and simultaneously. Inclusion of other health risk factors
produced elasticity estimates that were almost identical to those shown in the final model in
Table 1. In keeping with the CCE modeling strategy, these factors were added to the model as
state-specific and cross-sectional trend variables. None of the variables approached statistical
significance when entered into the model together or one by one (S1 Text, Sensitivity Analy-
ses). Many states did not have observations on the other health risk factors for all years, so
including these variables caused instability in the residual diagnostics. Therefore, these vari-
ables were omitted from the final analysis.
Public policies that affect smoking behavior.
Changes in smoking behavior may be cor-
related to other public health measures and general population awareness of healthy lifestyles,
environmental health, and public policies that affect access to care. A sensitivity analysis of pos-
sible confounding by these factors was conducted by adding available time series variables that
would be correlated with these factors, in the same way as was done for other health risks (S1
Text, Sensitivity Analyses). Variables describing the proportion of each state population that
was covered by 100% smoke-free laws (i.e., complete smoking bans at specific venues, such as
workplace, restaurants, etc.) and prevalence of lack of health insurance were added to the
model in this sensitivity analysis.
Other factors. Consistent time series are not available for other factors that may be corre-
lated with unmeasured changes in health risks or public health programs and policies. Perhaps
the most prominent such variable is educational attainment in the population. A robustness
check of the omission of this variable was conducted by studying the stability of relative state
levels of educational attainment across time. Another robustness check was conducted by esti-
mating the correlation over time between state educational attainment and a variable that
should be highly correlated: state real per capita personal income.

 Sensitivity to selection of estimation technique.
Additional sensitivity analyses were con-
ducted to evaluate the results of instrumental variable estimation for cigarette consumption per
smoker by including instruments for the variables mean consumption per smoker, prevalence
of cigarette smoking, per capita income, and proportion of the population age 65 y or older (S1
Text, Sensitivity Analysis). Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to account for possible cor-
relation in healthcare expenditure between states due to unobserved factors and for other
departures from standard assumptions on regression errors.
Estimated Change in Regional Healthcare Expenditures Attributable to
Smoking
The estimated elasticities in Table 1 were used to estimate the net average annual BEA regional
healthcare expenditure attributable to regional cigarette smoking behavior deviations from the
national average over the sample period. The unit of observation and analysis is the individual
state. Therefore, the estimated changes in state expenditures were aggregated to the regional
level using equal weights to calculate the aggregate results for the eight BEA economic regions.
Using equal weights gives the average experience of each state in the region, which is relevant
for evaluation of policy at the state level. The estimates of population-weighted changes pre-
sented in S1 Text (Effect of Weighting Scheme on Regional Healthcare Expenditures Attribut-
able to Smoking) were used as a measure of changes in expenditure for the regional
populations. The national panel regression coefficients were used for this analysis (Table 1)
because eight estimates of coefficients in the model (one for each BEA region) were more reli-
able than 51 estimates (one for each state, with a small sample size for each regional panel
regression—less than 20—for each state).
Deviations in per capita healthcare expenditures from the average national level (savings
below or excess expenditures above) were calculated for each state in four steps, and then aggre-
gated to the BEA regional level. First, for each state, the arc elasticity estimate of the deviation in
state healthcare expenditure attributable to the two smoking behavior variables were calculated by
multiplying the estimated elasticities of per capita healthcare for prevalence of current smoking
and measured mean cigarette consumption per smoker by the average percent difference between
the respective individual state and national averages of the smoking behavior variables over the
sample period. The elasticities estimated in the coefficients are valid for modeling the effect of
infinitesimal changes in the explanatory variables; the arc elasticity is an adjustment to account
for finite differences in the data. Second, the adjustments to per capita healthcare expenditures
due to state tax differentials were calculated in the same way: arc elasticities for the tax rates were
calculated by multiplying the estimated elasticities of healthcare expenditure by the average per-
cent difference between the respective individual state and national averages of the state cigarette
tax variables over the sample period. Third, the net regional healthcare expenditure attributable to
smoking adjusted for mismeasurement was calculated for each state by subtracting the results of
the second step from the results of the first step, by state. Fourth, the excess per capita expendi-
tures for each BEA region were calculated by taking the simple arithmetic average of each state in
each respective region. Total aggregate values for each state and region were calculated by multi-
plying the state or regional per capita estimates by the state or regional residential populations.
As a check on the reasonableness of the results, the proportion of measured cigarette con-
sumption per smoker due to estimated untaxed consumption was calculated. The calculation
was done by dividing the healthcare expenditure due to tax differentials—and therefore attrib-
utable to mismeasurement of cigarette consumption (found in step two above)—by the average
regional price of cigarettes to calculate the estimated unmeasured consumption in packs of cig-
arettes per capita. Estimated unmeasured consumption in packs of cigarettes per capita was

 then divided by the prevalence of current smokers to calculate the estimated unmeasured con-
sumption in terms of packs per smoker. Then the estimated unmeasured consumption in
terms of packs per smoker was divided by the measured mean cigarette consumption per cur-
rent smoker to estimate the estimated unmeasured consumption as a proportion of measured
consumption. This estimate gives the proportion of measured cigarette consumption in each
region, which can be compared to survey estimates of the proportion of untaxed cigarettes con-
sumed in the United States [28] and specific regions [29] to check the adequacy of our adjust-
ment for measurement error in cigarette consumption and the plausibility of the resulting
estimates of untaxed cigarette consumption.
Interval estimates for the excess expenditures and proportion of measured cigarette con-
sumption that is untaxed were calculated using the covariance matrix of the elasticities (which
for the logarithmic transformation is the same as the covariance matrix of coefficient matrix of
the regression coefficients). The distributions of excess expenditures and proportion of unmea-
sured cigarette consumption were normally distributed, so formulas for the variances of func-
tions of normal distributions were used to calculate standard errors (SEs).
Because we used the estimated elasticities to calculate the healthcare expenditure attribut-
able to differences in smoking behavior, the estimates are independent of the sample distribu-
tions of the other variables in the model. The results can be thought of as quantifying the
effects of changes in smoking behavior while holding all the other variables, such as per capita
personal income and age distribution of the population, constant.
Results
The elasticities of healthcare expenditure with respect to smoking prevalence and measured
mean cigarette consumption per smoker are 0.118 (SE 0.0259, p < 0.001) and 0.108 (SE 0.0253,
p < 0.001), respectively (Table 1). What these elasticities mean is that 1% relative reductions in
current smoking prevalence and in packs smoked per current smoker are associated with rela-
tive reductions of 0.118% and 0.108% of per capita healthcare expenditures, respectively. For
example, the average prevalence of smoking, consumption per smoker, and per capita health-
care expenditure over the sample period were 21.2%, 372 packs per year, and $6,426, respec-
tively. A 1% relative reduction in smoking prevalence from an absolute prevalence of 21.2% to
21.0% is associated with a $7.58 reduction in per capita healthcare expenditure. Likewise, a 5%
relative drop in smoking prevalence (from 21.2% to 20.1% absolute prevalence) is associated
with a reduction in per capita healthcare expenditure of $37.9. A 1% relative reduction in con-
sumption per smoker from 372 packs per year to 368 packs per year is associated with a $6.94
reduction in per capita healthcare expenditure. A 5% relative drop in consumption per smoker
(from 372 packs per smoker per year to 353 packs per year) is associated with a reduction in
per capita healthcare expenditure of $34.7. The R2 statistics indicate that the regression has
good explanatory power, particularly for describing variations in per capita healthcare expendi-
ture within each state over time (Table 2).
These estimates of decline in per capita healthcare expenditure associated with changes in
smoking behavior are counterfactual predictions that assume that all other factors other than
smoking behavior remain constant. The actual observed changes in healthcare expenditure in
future years will also depend on additional state-specific variables such as per capita income and
age structure of the population, in addition to their evolution via common trends across states.
Sensitivity Analyses
None of the sensitivity analyses for omitted variables produced a statistically significant or
even barely noticeable change in the regression coefficients of the estimated model (S1 Text,
Smoking and Healthcare Expenditure in the United States

 Sensitivity Analyses). The other health risk factors and policy variables do not seem to be
highly correlated, at least on a population level. In other conditions, there are significant state
and regional differences—and therefore significant correlation between the variables and
smoking behavior—at any one point in time, but there is little variation between states over
time. For example, in the case of obesity, at any one point in time, some states with high smok-
ing prevalence have a higher than average prevalence of obesity. However, the prevalence of
obesity in all states is increasing at approximately the same rate over time, albeit from different
starting levels. For this reason, state-level variations in obesity in a particular year do not con-
found state-level variations in smoking behavior over time. The robustness analysis on educa-
tion showed that the correlation between states in educational attainment over time was high,
particularly for the prevalence of bachelor degrees in the population over time. However, state
prevalence of both high school completion and bachelor degrees was highly correlated over
time with state real per capita personal income; therefore, we believe the possible direct effects
of education on health care expenditure or indirect effects through correlation with smoking
behavior are accounted for in the per capita income variable.
The results of the sensitivity analysis on instrumental variables did not produce evidence of
serious bias produced by problems with the instruments used for cigarette consumption per
smoker, except for proportion of the population age 65 y or over (S1 Text, Sensitivity Analy-
ses). When the proportion of the population that was elderly was instrumented, the coefficient
of that variable was reduced by about half, but the change in the coefficient was not statistically
significantly different from that presented in Table 1. There were no substantial changes in the
coefficients of the other variables. There was no trend in the coefficient estimates as a function
of factors that could produce bias, such as the strength of autocorrelation in the regression
residuals, and the SEs of the estimates presented in Table 1 were consistent with the point coef-
ficient estimates of the sensitivity analysis.
Estimated Change in Regional Healthcare Expenditures Attributable to
Smoking
Without adjustment for mismeasurement of cigarette consumption per smoker, the Far West
region has the largest estimated savings in annual per capita healthcare expenditure associated
with departures of its smoking behavior from the national average: $210 (SE $45.5); the South-
east region has the largest excess expenditure: $154 (SE $30.7) (Table 3).
After adjustment for state tax differentials, the Far West still has the largest total estimated
annual per capita savings, $182 (SE $51.7), but the New England region now has the largest
excess per capita expenditure, $104 (SE $25.4); the Southeast has the next largest, $94.4 (SE
$90.2) (Table 3). Total annual estimated expenditure per year due to the differences between
regional and national smoking behavior ranges from a savings of $9,470 million (SE $2,690

the Southeast region (Table 3).
The difference between measured and estimated true cigarette consumption per smoker
was less than 20% for all BEA regions except the Southeast, where estimated true consumption
was 23.6% (SE 29.2%) less than measured consumption, and New England, where estimated
true consumption was 41.6% (SE 9.06%) higher than measured (Table 3). These estimates are
similar to estimates from survey data collected by examining the source of cigarette packs in
different states in 2009 and 2010 [28]. The model’s statewide estimates of the proportion of cig-
arette consumption that is untaxed track survey estimates [29] for major urban centers in the
Mideast and New England reasonably well (Table 4). The comparisons are complicated by two
factors: the difference in areas in the regions covered and that the survey estimates provide
only ranges based on modeling assumptions. For example, untaxed consumption may be

 unusually high in New York City due to high local cigarette tax rates and may be higher there
than on average in other areas of New York state. See S1 Text (State-Specific Healthcare Expen-
ditures Attributable to Smoking) for population-weighted regional and individual state esti-
mates of excess expenditure associated with smoking behavior.
Discussion
Our estimates provide strong evidence that reducing smoking prevalence and cigarette con-
sumption per smoker are rapidly followed by lower healthcare expenditure. The model is
dynamic and predicts per capita healthcare expenditures in the current year as a function of
smoking behavior in the previous year. For example, 1% relative reductions in current smoking
prevalence and mean cigarette consumption per smoker in one year are associated with a
reduction in per capita healthcare expenditure in the next year of 0.118% + 0.108% = 0.226%
(SE 0.0363%), with all other factors including common trends held equal. In 2012, total health-
care expenditures in the US were $2.8 trillion [30]; our results suggest that, holding other com-
mon trends and factors affecting health care expenditures constant, a 10% relative drop in
smoking prevalence (about a 2.2% absolute drop) combined with a 10% relative drop in con-
sumption per remaining smoker (about 37 fewer packs/year) would be followed in the next
year by a $63 billion reduction in healthcare expenditure (in 2012 dollars).
These are short run 1- to 2-y predictions, and while they indicate that the effects of changes
in smoking on healthcare expenditure begin to appear quickly, they do not imply that all
changes in the costs and savings of smoking in the population are immediate. If all states
reduce their prevalence of smoking and cigarette consumption per smoker, then the corre-
sponding common trends will gradually change over time. The elasticity of the common trend
for the prevalence of smoking (from the model estimated with all cross-sectional averages
entered as separate variables, rather than using principal components) is relatively small and
not statistically significant (−0.0545, SE 0.0581, p = 0.348), so it is unlikely to play a large role
in longer run predictions. The elasticity of the common trend for cigarette consumption per
smoker (−0.255, SE 0.0488, p < 0.001) is not small relative to the state-specific cigarette con-
sumption per smoker variable. Over the longer run, changes in both smoking behavior vari-
ables will change the age structure of the population and trends in changes in healthcare
expenditures related to the prevalence of elderly people in the population. Therefore, longer
run predictions require a formal out-of-sample forecast study. The short run illustrative predic-
tions presented here also assume the continuation of historical aggregate trends that have been
associated with tobacco control policies, such as the declines in exposure to secondhand smoke
and in prevalence of smoking during pregnancy.

 These estimates are consistent with previous research on healthcare expenditures attribut-
able to cigarette smoking in California [12,13] and Arizona [14]. The previous research used
the aggregate population in control states to account for common trends in healthcare expendi-
ture, while the present study used the cross-sectional average expenditure across states. The
regression specifications also differ. In the previous research, specification searches were used
to determine the best regression model to use to estimate the effects of smoking in California
and Arizona versus the control states. Similar specification searches for each of the 51 cross-
sectional units (i.e., states) in the present study were not feasible, and variables that are proba-
bly irrelevant for California and Arizona were left in the specification because they are required
to be in the model for other states. However, inclusion of irrelevant variables for a state will not
bias the estimated elasticities and permits estimating an average effect across all states with a
simple panel regression specification.
This analysis uses aggregate measures of population characteristics to estimate the relation-
ships between smoking behavior variables and per capita healthcare expenditures. The elastic-
ity estimates are not directly comparable to estimates of the economic burden of cigarette
smoking using cross-sectional data on individuals in national health surveys [31]. Those esti-
mates use data on individuals to calculate the healthcare expenditure attributable to cigarette
consumption in individual current smokers or ever-smokers, contrasted to individual non-
smokers or never-smokers, respectively. Therefore, the expenditure estimates in the present
study should not be interpreted as healthcare costs arising in, or due to, individual smokers or
any specific individuals in the population. These estimates reflect all the healthcare expendi-
tures associated with smoking that arise in a population, which include short and long term
indirect effects on smokers and short and long term effects of second- and third-hand [32]
smoking exposure in non-smokers. However, previously published aggregate estimates for Cal-
ifornia [13] that are similar to those presented here are somewhat larger than, but consistent
with, cross-sectional estimates for that state using individual survey data [33], and the differ-
ence between these estimates is comparable to variation among different published cross-sec-
tional estimates based on individual data [6,34,35].
Our estimates do avoid some problems of estimates based on cross-sectional data. An exam-
ple is the “quitting sick” effect, which imputes expenditure savings to smokers who quit smok-
ing after being diagnosed with a serious chronic tobacco-related disease, such as lung cancer or
cardiovascular disease. The expected expenditure savings from quitting by a smoker who
remains well will not be realized in those who quit sick because expensive and irreversible
health effects of smoking have already occurred. The quitting sick effect is a consequence of
incorrectly imputing missing information (the unobservable health status of the smoker at the
time of cessation) that is not present in cross-sectional data. This study uses longitudinal data
on measures of smoking behavior and healthcare expenditures on large populations and there-
fore is not subject to quitting sick effects because the excess health care costs of those who quit
sick will be included in a state’s total aggregate healthcare expenditure data along with the
reduction in prevalence that occurs when the reduction in smoking of comparable people is
recorded in surveys that represent the population of that state. It should be noted that some
estimates of the health burden of cigarette smoking that account for quitting sick and other
problems with estimates based on cross-sectional data find a higher burden of smoking-related
disease and therefore higher smoking-attributable expenditures than most published cross-sec-
tional estimates [36–40].
The estimates presented here cannot be used to reliably estimate the change in healthcare
expenditure associated with complete elimination of cigarette consumption because the esti-
mated elasticities apply only to modest variation around the status quo, but they do capture
expenditures attributable to cigarette smoking in a large population that are difficult to

 measure from national health surveys (such as the effects of second- and third-hand smoke
exposure, and long term effects of developmental problems from premature birth and low
birth weight or asthma contracted during childhood, attributable to parental cigarette
smoking).
Our methods may suffer from spurious regressions and attribute non-smoking public health
factors that are correlated with smoking behavior to the smoking behavior. Specifically, this
research does not estimate a smoking attributable fraction of healthcare costs for each state
that corresponds to a measure that can be derived from individual survey data. Rather, it esti-
mates the average national effect of variations in aggregate-level state-specific smoking behav-
ior variables around the national trend in those variables on variations in state-specific real per
capita healthcare expenditure around its national trend.
Limitations
The results of this study are subject to the limitations of analysis of aggregate observational
data. A study of this nature that uses aggregate data and a relatively small sample size cannot,
by itself, establish a causal connection between smoking behavior and healthcare costs, and
that is not the goal of this study. Rather, this study should be evaluated in the context of the
existing body of research that has already established that the relationship between smoking
behavior and healthcare costs is causal using a variety of study designs [41–45].
These estimates do not address the issue of whether, over the whole life cycle, a population
without any cigarette smoking would have higher healthcare expenditures due to longer lived
non-smokers. Forecasting the very long run effects of reductions in smoking over the life cycle
in a US population would require the construction of a model to forecast the eventual changes
in the age structure of the population and resulting changes in per capita healthcare expendi-
tures as a function of smoking behavior.
Conclusions
Lower smoking prevalence and cigarette consumption per smoker are associated with lower
per capita healthcare expenditures. Historical regional variations in smoking behavior (includ-
ing those due to the effects of state tobacco control programs, smoking restrictions, and differ-
ences in taxation) are associated with substantial differences in per capita healthcare
expenditures across the United States. Those regions (and the states in them) that have imple-
mented public policies to reduce smoking have substantially lower medical costs. Likewise,
those that have failed to implement tobacco control policies have higher medical costs.
Changes in healthcare costs begin to be observed quickly after changes in smoking behavior.
State and national policies that reduce smoking should be part of short term healthcare cost
containment.
