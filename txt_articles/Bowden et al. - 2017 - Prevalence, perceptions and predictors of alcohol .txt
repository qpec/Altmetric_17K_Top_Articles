Abstract
Background: Alcohol consumption by young people (particularly early initiation) is a predictor for poorer health in
later life. In addition, evidence now clearly shows a causal link between alcohol and cancer. This study investigated
prevalence, predictors of alcohol consumption among adolescents including perceptions of the link between alcohol
and cancer, and the role of parents and peers.
Methods: A sample of Australian school students aged 12–17 years participated in a survey (n = 2885). Logistic
regression analysis was undertaken to determine predictors.
Results: Alcohol use increased with age and by 16, most had tried alcohol with 33.1% of students aged 12–17 reporting
that they drank at least occasionally (95% CI = 31.0–35.2). Awareness of the link between alcohol and cancer was low
(28.5%). Smoking status and friends’ approval were predictive of drinking, whereas parental disapproval was protective.
Those aged 14–17 who did not think the link between alcohol and cancer was important were more likely to drink, as
were those living in areas of least disadvantage. The only factors that predicted recent drinking were smoking and the
perception that alcohol was easy to purchase.
Conclusions: An education campaign highlighting the link between alcohol and cancer may have positive flow-on
effects for young people, and schools should incorporate this messaging into any alcohol education programs.
Consideration should be given to factors that serve to regulate under-aged accessibility of alcohol.

Background
Alcohol consumption is responsible for approximately
3.3 million deaths annually, and accounts for 5.1% of the
global burden of disease. Harmful consumption of alco-
hol has been ranked among the top five risk factors for
non-communicable disease, disability and death globally
and has been causally linked to over 200 health condi-
tions including cancer [1]. In 1988, alcoholic beverages
were classified as a class 1 carcinogen [2], and a large
body of evidence now demonstrates the causal link
between alcohol consumption and cancer [3]. Alcohol
consumption is therefore a topic of considerable public
health concern internationally.
A recent Australian study estimated that over 5500
Australian deaths are attributable to alcohol each year [4].
Among males, injury was held responsible for 36% of
these deaths, followed by cancers (25%) and digestive
diseases (16%). Among females the highest proportion of
alcohol-attributable
deaths
was
from
cardiovascular
diseases (34%), followed by cancers (31%) and injuries
(12%) [4]. There is now convincing evidence that alcohol
causes cancer of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus,
bowel (in men) and breast cancers among women. There
is also probable evidence that alcohol increases the risk of
bowel cancer in women and liver cancer [3]. There is a

 dose-response relationship between alcohol and cancer
risk with increasing consumption associated with in-
creased risk [3, 5]. For this reason, Cancer Councils are
now recommending that ‘to reduce their risk of cancer,
people limit their consumption of alcohol, or better still
avoid alcohol altogether’ [6]. It is possible that these esti-
mates may be updated and increased over time with more
emerging evidence of the link between alcohol and cancer.
Drinking patterns tend to be laid down in adolescence
and early adulthood [7]. Consumption by young people,
particularly early initiation (i.e. for those aged 11 to
14 years), is a predictor of poorer health in later life [8].
There has been a decline in alcohol consumption among
adolescents in Australia, particularly in the last decade
[9], Europe and the US [10, 11]. Despite this, alcohol re-
mains one of the most commonly used intoxicating
substances among school students. It is important to
note that while the number of current drinkers has de-
creased, the rate of consuming more than four drinks on
one occasion in the past 7 days has not decreased
among current drinkers [9]. Research in 2011 suggested
that 50.7% of Australian secondary school students had
consumed alcohol in the past year. Rates of drinking
regularly increase with age from 5.1% at age 12 to 36.7%
by age 17 [12].
Improving community understanding of lifestyle risk
factors associated with cancer has been identified as a
key strategy for preventing cancer globally [13]. Cancer
is one of the most feared diseases in Australian adults
[14], and internationally [15]. Improving awareness of
the link between alcohol and cancer therefore may well
influence an individual to consider moderation of their
consumption or even abstinence. However, international
evidence shows that the majority of people are not aware
of the link between alcohol and cancer [16–18]. This is
the case in Australia, with a recent study finding that
only 36.6% of adults were aware of the important link.
This study also found that those that were aware of the
risk were less likely to drink beyond the health guide-
lines threshold for lifetime risk [19]. Only a few studies
have examined awareness among young people, with a
study in the UK finding that 37% of young people aged
15 to 24 years were aware of the link [18]. To our know-
ledge, awareness of the link between alcohol and cancer
has not previously been examined among secondary
school students in Australia.
Understanding adolescents’ reasons for drinking is
critical for developing intervention strategies. The Social
Development Model postulates influence from social
controls, social learning and patterns of association
(whereby attitudes and anti-social behaviours are acquired
through interaction with others) as important predictors
of poor and good behavioural choices in adolescence [20].
Consistent with this model, alcohol consumption in young
people has been associated with parental attitudes toward
consumption [21], peer use, and perceptions of peer atti-
tudes to alcohol use [22]. According to this model, the in-
fluence of peers becomes increasingly important in later
adolescence, at which time parental involvement and the
influence of family declines [20]. The role of peer influ-
ence, particularly in later adolescence has been supported
in both theory and empirical alcohol studies [23].
Alcohol consumption among school children has been
associated with a number of other covariates, including:
more weekly spending money [24]; self-reported academic
difficulty among females [25]; and participation in other
risk-taking
behaviours
including
smoking
[26].
The
relationship between alcohol consumption and socio-
economic status (SES) is less clear than it is with other
risk factors for cancer. People with higher SES tend to
drink more frequently than others, but among those that
drink, the lower socio-economic groups tend to drink lar-
ger quantities [27].
The first aim of this study is to confirm currently doc-
umented prevalence of alcohol consumption and it is
hypothesised, that consistent with most recent evidence,
there will be a pattern of increasing consumption with
age among adolescents. The principle hypothesis is that
the majority of students will not be aware that alcohol
causes cancer but among those that are, will be less
likely to drink alcohol or be recent drinkers. The second
hypothesis of this study is that perceived parental disap-
proval of alcohol consumption will be a protective factor
for consumption in later school years.
Methods
Study population
Data were obtained from a 2011 cross-sectional survey
of a representative sample of South Australian secondary
students that formed part of a larger cohort, namely the
Australian School Students’ Alcohol and Drugs survey
(ASSAD) monitoring survey. This study was approved
by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Cancer
Council Victoria (HREC 1013). Parental consent was re-
quired prior to their participation because this was a
study of minors aged under 18 years of age. All guard-
ians were sent home a consent form to sign which out-
lined the study purpose and the fact that responses were
confidential. They were required to complete it and re-
turn it prior to their children commencing their survey.
If guardian consent was not obtained, students were not
asked to complete the survey.
The data are largely representative of the age levels
sampled in the South Australian population. In 2011, a
total sampling frame of 145 South Australian schools
were approached; of these, 82 declined to participate,
giving a final school participation rate of 43.5% (n = 63).
A random sampling methodology was used to select

 schools from the Government, Catholic and Independ-
ent schools.1 Students were then randomly selected from
within each identified school. Two samples were drawn
to reflect junior students (up to Year 10) and senior stu-
dents (Years 11–12). Several (16) primary schools were
also included in the South Australian sample in order to
obtain responses from Year 7 students (the majority of
whom are 12 years old).
Participating schools provided the list of students cur-
rently enrolled for each of the year levels for which they
were selected (junior or senior secondary), and random
samples of 20 students (plus 6 replacement students)
were identified. Survey researchers then attended the
school to administer the pencil and paper questionnaire.
Anonymity and confidentiality were emphasised during
administration of the survey. A number of strategies
were employed to enhance student perceptions of confi-
dentiality, including use of external research staff, ad-
ministering the survey under test conditions, placing
teachers at the front or back of the room, training re-
searchers only to look at questionnaires when asked a
question by a student and providing blank envelopes into
which students placed and sealed their questionnaires.
They answered the survey anonymously and it was com-
pleted within one lesson. This was a monitoring survey
and a power calculation for the hypotheses tested here
was not therefore undertaken before data collection.
Nonetheless, the sample size was such as to mitigate this
as a limitation, a total of 2885 students aged between 12
and 17 completed the survey providing sufficient numbers
for all between and within age group comparisons.
The national study was coordinated by Cancer Council
Victoria, and approved by the Human Research Ethics
Committee of Cancer Council Victoria (HREC 1013).
Measures
Alcohol consumption
The primary dependent variable for this study was
current drinking status. Students were asked “At the
present time, do you consider yourself: A non-drinker;
An occasional drinker; A light drinker; A party drinker;
or A heavy drinker?” Responses were coded into non-
drinker and drinker (all other categories) for most logis-
tic regression analyses. Drinking status was collapsed
because we wanted to test predictors of committed
drinking behaviour versus no or episodic drinking.
Students that indicated any consumption were asked to
report the number of drinks that they had had in each
of the last 7 days. Those that had had at least one drink
in the last 7 days were classified as recent drinkers.
Demographic and background variables
Students reported their age and gender and were asked,
“During a normal week, how much money do you have
available to spend on yourself (e.g. from pocket money,
part-time
job)?”.
Response
categories
were
‘none’
,
‘$1–$40’
, ‘$41–$80’
, ‘$81–$120’ and ‘$120 and over’. To
assess self-rated performance at school, students were
asked “At school work, do you consider yourself: ‘a lot
above average?’
, ‘above average’
, ‘average’
, ‘below average’
,
and ‘a lot below average’”. Students were asked to write
the number of cigarettes they had each day for each of
the last 7 days. Current smokers were classified as those
that had smoked at least one cigarette in the past 7 days.
Students reported their home postcodes, which were
then matched with a corresponding Index of Relative
Socio-economic Disadvantage quartile as a measure of
neighbourhood socioeconomic status [28].
Beliefs about drinking
Using the approach adapted from a previous study [29],
students were asked to rate the importance of alcohol in in-
creasing a person’s risk of getting cancer on a five- point
scale (1 = not at all important, 2 = slightly important,
3 = moderately important, 4 = very important and 5 = ex-
tremely important). Responses were subsequently grouped
into dichotomous categories combining “very” and “ex-
tremely important” versus all other responses for analyses.
Students were also asked to rate their agreement
(1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = agree, 4 = strongly
agree) with the following statements: “My parents/guardian
would not approve of me drinking” and “My friends would
approve of me drinking”. Drinkers were also asked to
rate agreement with the statement, “Being able to buy
alcohol easily encourages me to drink a lot” using the
same response format.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were undertaken using StataIC 13.1,
the estimating tools of which account for the clustered,
stratified survey design by utilising more robust esti-
mates of standard error. Whether a school was a
Government School, Catholic School or Independent
School defined the strata. Chi-square tests were under-
taken to determine univariate associations with ‘drinking’
i.e. ever (Yes/No) and ‘recent drinking’ (last 7 days) (Table
2). We undertook logistic regression models to determine
predictors of these behaviours, stratified by age, to test the
second hypothesis, specifically, that perceived parental dis-
approval for alcohol consumption will be protective in early
years, and perception of peer approval of drinking would
add risk in later schooling years (Tables 3, 4, 5). We then
investigated recent drinking as the outcome variable
among the sub-sample of drinkers (Table 6). Demographic
variables were entered in both models (i.e., test of predic-
tors of drinking status and test of predictors of drinking
recently) at the first step. These included sex, the index of
disadvantage, available spending money each week and

 self-reported ability at school. Smoking status was added
at the second step. In the third step, awareness of the link
between alcohol and cancer was added to test hypothesis
1, and finally friends’ approval and parental disapproval to
test hypothesis 2. An additional variable was added into
the drinkers status model: ‘being able to buy alcohol easily
encourages me to drink a lot’
, in order to determine
whether availability was a significant additional predictor.
Results
Alcohol consumption among school students
Table 1 shows drinking status by age and gender. Reports
of drinking (occasional through to heavy drinker) increased
significantly with age (χ2 (df = 20, N = 2864) =715.78,
p < .001) from 7.6% among 12 year olds to 66.3% among
17 year olds. Overall, 33.1% of students aged 12–17 years
reported that they drank at least occasionally (95%
CI = 31.0–35.2). There were more non-drinkers than
drinkers among 12–15 year olds, but at 16 years of age the
number of drinkers (59.5%) exceeded the number of
non-drinkers. There was no significant difference by
gender. Overall, 15.0% reported having consumed an
alcoholic beverage in the past 7 days; this finding did
not differ significantly by gender either (15.3% males and
14.8% females).
Perceptions of the link between alcohol and cancer
In total, 28.5% of students rated alcohol as “very import-
ant” or “important” in increasing a person’s risk of cancer.
Males were less likely to rate alcohol as important or very
important than females [23.6% vs. 33.5%, χ2 (df = 48,
N = 2875) =34.4, p < .001]. Table 2 shows that although
there was no significant difference in ratings of alcohol as
a risk factor for cancer between 12 and 13 year olds who
drank and those who did not, those aged 14–15 and
16–17 who drank were significantly less likely than those
who did not drink to rate alcohol as “very important” or
“important” in increasing a person’s risk of cancer.
Predictors of alcohol consumption
A number of the demographic variables and the mea-
sures of reported endorsement of drinking by others
were significantly related to drinking status at the uni-
variate level (Table 2). There was a clear association be-
tween smoking and drinking across all ages. There was
no clear association between drinking and the index of
disadvantage.
Those
with
more
available
spending
money per week were more likely to drink at all ages as
were those with average or below average self-reported
ability at school. Parental disapproval was protective
from consumption whereas friends’ approval was pre-
dictive of consumption (at all). Those that thought there
was an important link between alcohol and cancer were
less likely to drink when aged 14–17 years. Those that
agreed that “being able to buy alcohol easily encourages
me to drink a lot” were more likely to drink. Overall, 4
models were tested for each of the three age groups
(12–13 year olds: Table 3, 14–15 year olds: Table 4 and
16–17 year olds: Table 5).
Among 12–13 year olds, model 1 showed that school
children at this age are 3.5 times more likely to drink if
they have between $41 and $80 spending money per week,
and 4 times more likely to drink if they have between $81
and $120. Gender, socio-economic disadvantage and self-
reported schooling ability were not significant influences
on drinking. In model 2, smokers were 10 times more
likely to drink. Model 3 showed that the addition of
awareness of the link between alcohol and cancer did not
explain additional variance. Model 4 included friends’ ap-
proval of drinking and parental disapproval of drinking.
The addition of these variables increased the odds ratios
for smokers to 15 times more likely to drink and available
spending money to 9 times more likely, for those with
between $41 and $80 a week, and 13 times for those
with $81–$120 per week. Interestingly, the inclusion of
these variables resulted in a significant incremental
contribution to predicted variance by cancer-alcohol
knowledge; those who did not link alcohol and cancer
were less likely to drink, a direction contrary to that
hypothesised. Consistent with the hypothesis, those
who reported that their friends approved of their drink-
ing were 6 times more likely to drink and those who re-
ported that their parents did not approve of drinking
were much less likely to drink.

 The picture among 14–15 year olds was very similar,
although the influence of schooling ability was signifi-
cant in this age group. Model 1, Table 4 shows that
amount of available spending money increased the odds
of drinking by at least 2 times up to nearly 6 times for
those with between $81 and $120 per week. Those
reporting average schooling ability were twice as likely
as those that were a lot above average to drink; those
that were below average were nearly 6 times and those
that reported they were a lot below average were 12
times more likely to drink. Model 2 added smoking sta-
tus, which did not change the other odds ratios much,
but did confirm that smokers were nearly 10 times more
likely to drink. Model 3 added awareness of the link be-
tween alcohol and cancer, which was significant. The
other odds ratios did not change much, but those that
did not see alcohol as a very or important risk factor for
cancer were about 1.5 times more likely to drink alcohol
as those that did see it as a risk, confirming the hypoth-
esis within this age group. Model 4 included friends’ ap-
proval of drinking and parental disapproval of drinking.
The inclusion of these variables reduced the importance
of available spending money as a predictor to non-
significance, but all other odds ratios remained similar.
Consistent with the hypothesis, those who reported that
their friends approved of their drinking were 6 times
more likely to drink and those who reported that
their parents did not support their drinking were less
likely to drink.
A similar result was found among 16 and 17 year olds
(Table 5). Model 1 showed that available spending money
increased the odds of drinking by at least two times, and
up to 4.7 times for those getting over $121 per week.
Those reporting above average schooling ability were
twice as likely as those that were a lot above average to
drink; those that were average were 3.5 times, those below
average were 4.4 times and those that reported they were
a lot below average were 18 times more likely to drink.
Model 2 added smoking status, which did not substan-
tially change the other odds ratios, but removed the effect
of being a lot below average ability and indicated that
smokers were nearly 9 times more likely to drink than
those that did not smoke. Model 3 added awareness of the
link between alcohol and cancer, which was significant.
The other odds ratios changed very little, but those re-
spondents that did not see alcohol as a very or important
risk factor for cancer were 1.7 times more likely to drink
alcohol compared to those that did, consistent with the
hypothesis. Model 4 included friends’ approval of drinking
and parental disapproval of drinking. Contrary to the

 hypothesis, the inclusion of these two variables did not
substantially change the other odds ratios but allowed for
the detection of gender as a possible predictor in the
model. Those that were least disadvantaged were less
likely to drink, as were those who reported that their par-
ents did not support their drinking (contrary to that
hypothesised for older age groups), while those who re-
ported that their friends approved of their drinking were
nearly 7 times more likely to drink.
Predictors for drinking alcohol in the past week (i.e. re-
cent drinking) were also examined (Table 6). Model 1
shows that those aged 14–15 years old were twice as likely
as 12–13 year olds to drink in the previous week. Those in
the third quintile of disadvantage were less likely to drink
regularly than the most disadvantaged group. Those with
access to available spending money of $121 and over were
also 2.3 times more likely to drink recently than those
with no available spending money. Model 2 added smok-
ing status, which was again a strong predictor (nearly 6
times more likely to drink regularly). Contrary to hypoth-
esis one and two, the addition of awareness of the link be-
tween alcohol and cancer did not add to the model, nor
did friends’ approval of drinking and parental disapproval.
Finally, those that agreed that ‘being able to buy alcohol
easily encourages me to drink’ were 1.7 times more likely
to be recent drinkers.
Discussion
The first aim of this study was to confirm the prevalence
of alcohol consumption. A pattern of increasing con-
sumption with age, reported in previous literature, was
observed in our data. By 16 years of age the number of
drinkers exceeded the number of non-drinkers.
The second hypothesis of the study was that the ma-
jority of students would not be aware that alcohol causes
cancer but this was only partially supported with results
varying between age groups and outcomes.
Overall, the results revealed that, as hypothesed,
awareness of the link was low, with only one in four or
28.5% of students being aware. These figures were lower
than those obtained in a recent survey of Australian
adults (36.6%) [19], and of the finding in the UK that
37% of young people aged 15 to 24 years were aware of
the link [18]. It is important to note that since this study
was undertaken, awareness may have increased as evi-
dence of a clear link between alcohol and cancer has
improved and dissemination increased. It is beyond the
scope of this study to investigate paid and unpaid media

 on this topic, but it warrants further research and a
follow-up study should be undertaken.
Consistent with previous research involving adults
[19], results indicated that awareness of the cancer link
discriminated ‘no consumption ever’ from ‘any con-
sumption’
, although, paradoxically, we found no relation-
ship between awareness and recent consumption. It is
possible that such a relationship (even though it may be
small) might exist among recent drinkers, but that low
levels of recent consumption in the current sample, not-
withstanding the large sample size, obscured this rela-
tionship. It was also interesting to note that while
awareness of the link between alcohol and cancer was
protective against drinking in the 14–17 year olds, the
inverse relationship was found for 12–13 year olds. This
may be a statistical anomaly or may indicate that aware-
ness of the link between alcohol and cancer becomes
more important with age.
The second hypothesis of this study was that perceived
parental disapproval for alcohol consumption will be
protective in early years, and perception of peer approval
of drinking will predict consumption in later school
years. The results indicated that students’ perceptions of
parental disapproval was predictive of drinking at all
mid-teen ages (i.e. where a student reported that a
parent did not disapprove, a student was more likely to
consume alcohol). This contrasts with predictions based
on Social Development Theory that parental attitudes
would have reduced importance with increasing adoles-
cent age. Moreover, also in contrast with theory, percep-
tions of peer attitudes to alcohol was a significant
predictor regardless of age.
As expected, and consistent with previous studies [26],
smoking was strongly related to alcohol consumption
across ages. It would be interesting to explore whether the
awareness of cancer-alcohol risk differs for smokers and
non-smokers because it is possible that smokers may
weigh cancer risk less heavily in their decision-making.
Also consistent with the literature, available spending
money per week [24] and self-reported average or below-
average school achievement were predictive of drinking
[25]. Interestingly, however, when non-drinkers were re-
moved from the model, the only significant predictors of
drinking within the previous week were smoking status
and the perception that ‘being able to buy alcohol easily
encourages me to drink a lot’. This result presents some
difficulty for interpretation given that ease might relate to
any one or more of financial ease, physical accessibility, or
parental attitude. Further research should examine the
drivers of self-reported ease of access.

 The strengths of the current study include the large
sample size and the fact that data were weighted to
reflect the South Australian school student population,
increasing confidence in the generalisability of the find-
ings. There are, however, some limitations. The survey
was cross-sectional so causation cannot be determined.
In addition, the study relies on self-report of drinking
identity rather than actual behaviour; this can be subject
to bias, although anonymity was assured to reduce this
potential bias. The study looked at drinking frequency
rather than volume of consumption, and amounts
consumed should be investigated in future studies.
Also, while the questionnaire had face validity its
questions have not undergone rigorous reliability and
validity testing. The survey was also limited by the
small number of predictors able to be included be-
cause of cost and time restrictions; we did not assess
the
role
that
other
factors
might
play
including
media, advertising and role modelling.
Conclusions
The present study demonstrates that consumption of al-
cohol by adolescents increases with age cross-sectionally.
Moreover, consumption can be predicted by adolescent
report of parental attitudes towards drinking, and also by
peer attitudes. In light of the findings that early initiation
of drinking predicts poorer health in later life [8], the
study highlights the importance of parental attitudes to
student drinking. It is also interesting to note that those
aged 14–17 years with an awareness of the link between
alcohol and cancer were less likely to drink, indicating that
an education campaign and messaging about the link
might impact young people. It would therefore be poten-
tially beneficial for schools to include greater information
concerning the longer-term health consequences of drink-
ing in health advice provided during the school years. The
study’s results also indicate that greater consideration
should be given to the factors that serve to regulate acces-
sibility to alcohol among those underage.

1The Australian schooling system consists of primary
school (generally for ages 5 to 12 years) and then
secondary school (generally age 12 to 17 years). Most
Catholic schools are run by their local parish, local dio-
cese and the Catholic education department. The major-
ity of other independent schools have a formal religious
affiliation (e.g. Protestant, Jewish, Islamic), while some
are non-denominational. Some pursue particular educa-
