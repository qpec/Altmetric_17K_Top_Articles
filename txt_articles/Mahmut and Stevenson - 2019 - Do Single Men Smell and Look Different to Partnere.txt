Previous research indicates human body odor (BO) can signal kinship, sickness
and genetic compatibility. Based on research indicating single males have higher
testosterone levels than partnered males and that higher testosterone levels are
associated with stronger smelling BO, the current study aimed to determine if, by
extension of previous findings, single males’ BO smells stronger than partnered males’
BO. Eighty-two heterosexual women aged 18–35 years rated the BO and faces of six
different males also aged 18–35 years. Consistent with the hypothesis, single men’s BO
smelled stronger than partnered men’s BO and single men’s faces were rated as more
masculine than partnered men’s faces. The possible advantages of females being able
to identify single males are addressed in the Discussion.

INTRODUCTION
Humans rely heavily on visual cues to make mate preference judgements. From an evolutionary
perspective, mate preferences based on facial attractiveness is advantageous for identifying and
selecting a high quality partner (Buss and Schmidt, 1993). For example, research findings have
demonstrated that facial attractiveness (Coetzee et al., 2009) and color (Stephen et al., 2011) are
associated with physiological health. However, despite the vast majority of research focussing on
signals detected by the visual sense, humans do not rely solely on visual cues to assess the suitability
of a potential partner but also make judgements using their sense of smell (Stevenson, 2009).
Specifically, the body odor (BO) of a potential partner is assessed by our sense of smell (Lübke and
Pause, 2015) and given BOs can signal physical health and genetic compatibility with a potential
partner, the role of BOs in mate attraction, and preference is not surprising.
In terms of our health, some infections (e.g., gangrene), and diseases (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis)
cause our bodies to emit odors that physicians can reliably recognize and use for diagnostic
confirmation (Bijland et al., 2013). In terms of the genetic compatibility of a couple, a set of
genes encoding the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) –cell-surface proteins involved in
pathogen resistance (Milinski, 2006) that influence our BO (Milinski et al., 2013) – may also
contribute to mate preference based on BO preference. For example, women have demonstrated
a preference for the BO of men who have dissimilar MHC (Wedekind et al., 1996; Wedekind and
Füri, 1997; Sorokowska et al., 2018) and offspring from MHC dissimilar (vs. similar) parents are
potentially healthier. However, a recent meta-analysis (Winternitz et al., 2017) on the role of MHC
in mate preference in various studies (not just those on BO-based preferences), concluded that mate
choice was not driven by MHC differences.
Human BOs are not static and can change due to many factors, such as diet and menstrual
cycle. For example, a study that experimentally controlled the amount of red meat consumed
over a two-week period, found that a diet higher in meat is associated with unpleasant smelling

Single and Partnered Men’s BO and Faces
BO compared to a non-meat diet (Havlíˇ
cek and Lenochova,
2006). However, it must be noted that Zuniga et al. (2017) found
that higher meat consumption was associated with more pleasant
smelling BO, although meat consumption frequency was based
on self-report data which may account for the contrary findings
to Havlíˇ
cek and Lenochova (2006). Moreover, men’
s preferences
for female BO vary based on the different stages of a women’
s
menstrual cycle which are associated with the most dramatic
changes in hormone levels; giving higher preference ratings for
women’
s BO in the fertile phase of their cycle than those in the
non-fertile phase (Gildersleeve et al., 2012).
While research investigating changes in hormone levels
predominantly focus on the menstrual cycle, numerous studies
have found differences in men’
s hormone levels based on their
relationship status. Specifically, research findings have shown
that heterosexual men with higher levels of testosterone were
less likely to be married (Booth and Dabbs, 1993; Mazur and
Michalek, 1998; van Anders and Watson, 2007; Van Anders
and Goldey, 2010) or in long-term relationships (Gray et al.,
2004) whereas lower levels of testosterone were associated with
being in a romantic relationship. Further, various hormones (e.g.,
cortisol and testosterone) may affect the quality of a man’
s BO
(Rantala et al., 2006) and how attractive they are perceived to
be. For example, Thornhill et al. (2013) found that women’
s
preference for BO of high testosterone men was significantly
correlated (r = 0.32) with their probability of conception risk,
presumably because higher testosterone may confer some form
of evolutionary fitness (see Folstad and Karter, 1992). Similarly,
Butovskaya et al. (2013) reported that women in the most
fertile phase of their menstrual cycle prefer the BO of men
with masculine qualities (e.g., social dominance) and numerous
studies have shown women prefer BO of men with symmetrical
faces (Gangestad and Thornhill, 1998; Thornhill and Gangestad,
1999; Thornhill et al., 2003).
In van Anders and Watson (2006) social neuroendocrinology
theoretical framework, they presented evidence detailing the
important role testosterone plays in behaviors that predict
evolutionary
fitness,
namely;
competition
for
resources,
establishing a pair bond (securing a relationship), sexual activity
plus parenting and pregnancy. A prediction arising from
this conceptual framework is that higher testosterone levels
are associated with competitive behaviors (such as acquiring
resources) whereas lower testosterone levels are associated with
pair-bond maintenance behaviors (such as intimate contact;
van Anders and Watson, 2006). Given the evidence that men’
s
hormone levels may differ based on their relationship status, and
that hormone levels may in turn change the perceptual quality
of men’
s BO, the aim of the current study was to empirically
investigate for the first time whether single and partnered men’
s
BO was perceptually different. Moreover, to assess the role that
both visual and olfactory perception may play in mate preference,
two modalities that are predominantly researched independently,
the current study also tested whether the faces of single and
partnered men differed based on visual ratings.
To determine whether single men’
s BO smelled different
to the BO of partnered men, heterosexual female participants
rated men’
s BO on five characteristics (e.g., sexiness, liking).
Based on previous research suggesting male testosterone levels
were positively (but not significantly) associated with stronger
smell BO ratings (Rantala et al., 2006) and single males have
higher levels of testosterone (e.g., Booth and Dabbs, 1993), we
hypothesized that single men’
s BO would smell stronger than
that of partnered men’
s. Moreover, because stronger smelling
BO ratings are associated with lower BO liking ratings (Havlíˇ
cek
and Lenochova, 2006), we predicted that single men’
s BO would
be liked less and rated less sexy than partnered men’
s BO. In
order to determine whether BO attractiveness predicted facial
attractiveness, participants also rated the faces of the BO donors.
Although the findings from three previous studies (Rikowski and
Grammer, 1999; Thornhill and Gangestad, 1999; Foster, 2008)
indicated the correlation between male BO and face attractiveness
ratings made by fertile women is low (e.g., r = 0.28, p = 0.030;
Thornhill and Gangestad, 1999), we hypothesized that favorable
BO ratings (i.e., higher liking and sexiness) would be associated
with favorable face ratings (e.g., attractive, masculine). We made
no a priori predictions about differences between single and
partnered men’
s face attractiveness ratings. Finally, to ensure the
ability to compare the BO and face ratings of single and partnered
men, participants rated the stimuli of three single and three
partnered unknown men.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Eight-two (42 single,
40 partnered) heterosexual females
(M = 20.2 years, SD = 2.9) completed the study at Macquarie
University for credit towards an introductory psychology course.
A single participant was someone who was not in a committed
romantic relationship whereas a partnered participant was
someone was in a monogamous, romantic relationship. Given
single and partnered women may perceive a man’
s BO or face
differently (e.g., Little et al., 2002) we included both partnered
and single women in this study. Participants were asked about
their medical history and to indicate whether their sense of smell
functioned normally. Only heterosexual females aged between
18 and 35 years, who indicated they had a normal sense of
small with no history of a condition, injury or surgery that
compromised their sense of smell prior to, or on the day of the
study, qualified for the study. Clearance to conduct the study was
granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee at Macquarie
University’
s and all participants and donors gave written and
informed consent.
Donors of Body Odor and Face Pictures
The BOs and face pictures of 91 males formed the stimuli pool
for the current study. The donors had no other involvement in
the study aside from supplying their BO and face picture. The
majority of donors were selected by participants; for partnered
participants, the donor was their current partner and for single
participants, the donor was their friend or brother. However, the
Experimenters also recruited 10 donors to ensure there was a
sufficiently large stimulus pool to draw from. All donors had to be
aged between 18 and 35 years to qualify for the study. All donors

Single and Partnered Men’s BO and Faces
were heterosexual, except for one who identified as homosexual,
whose BO was included in the stimulus pool. Overall, 46 of
the BO donors were single and 45 were partnered. However,
there was no significant difference between single and partnered
donors in terms of their Body Mass Index (BMI; 24.8 vs. 24.3) or
age (21 vs. 22.5 years).
Donor Data, Stimuli Collection and
Preparation
Body Odor Collection and Preparation
Approximately one week before testing, each participant
collected a donor pack from the Experimenter. The donor pack
included a new, white, 100% cotton T-shirt in a resealable
plastic bag, an instructions sheet and short survey containing
demographic questions which participants delivered it to their
known donor. Odor donors were instructed to avoid eating
odorous foods (e.g., garlic, onion; Fialová et al., 2016) 24 h
before and while wearing the T-shirt, wash using non-perfumed
products before wearing the T-shirt and not to use perfumed
products while wearing the T-shirt (Allen et al., 2016). The donor
was instructed to wear the T-shirt for one day (i.e., no more than
24 h) and to not remove the shirt until a significant amount
of sweat was absorbed onto the underarm of the T-shirt. The
instruction sheet included a photograph of a model wearing a
white T-shirt depicting an unacceptable amount of underarm
sweat (i.e., approximately 25% of underarm patch appeared wet
with sweat) and the minimum acceptable amount of underarm
sweat (i.e., approximately 75% of underarm patch appeared wet
with sweat). The type of physical activity participants engaged in
to produce the sweat was not prescribed but it was suggested that
brisk walking or sporting activities may facilitate sweating.
After removing the T-shirt, donors were asked to return the
T-shirt to the resealable plastic bag provided and immediately
store in a freezer. Participants collected the sweated-in T-shirt
from donors and brought it in on the day of testing. Participants
were informed of the importance of keeping the shirt in a freezer
until bringing it into the lab. Upon receiving the T-shirt, the
Experimenter cut out both underarms of the T-shirt and placed
each in a new separate, opaque, plastic condiment bottle that was
approximately 14 cm tall with a 250 mL capacity. Each bottle had
a screw-on lid with an elongated nozzle with a removal cap and
a 5mm opening through which the odorant was delivered. When
not in use, the bottles stored in a freezer, a method validated in
previous studies (e.g., Lenochova et al., 2009).
Face Pictures
Donors also supplied a current, digital, color, passport-style
photo (i.e., neutral face, no hat or glasses) which was digitally
adjusted using a computer to a height of 8 cm before being
printed (in color) on white, A4-sized paper.
Donor Demographics
Each donors’
height, weight, age, relationship status (i.e., single
or partnered) and relationship to participant (i.e., partner, friend,
relative) was collected via a short self-report survey that was
included in the donor pack.
Measures
Excluded Participants and Variables
Two partnered participants’data were excluded from analyses
because one’
s partner was not within the accepted age range (of
18 to 35 years) and the other returned a T-shirt smelling of
perfume. Other measures were administered as part of a larger
project, namely self-report measures relating to the nature of the
donor-target relationship. The results from these measures were
unrelated to the aims and hypotheses of the current study and are
therefore not reported here. Finally, to remove any bias associated
with preference a participant may have for their donor’
s BO
and/or face, the results presented do not include the data from
the ratings participants made of their donor.
Body Odor and Face Stimuli Selection
The Experimenter selected six different donors’
BO and the six
corresponding face pictures which each Participant would be
presented in a random order. The first BO and face picture
selected belonged to the participant’
s donor. The BOs and faces
of the next six donors (three single, three partnered) were
randomly selected from two separate donor pools; one consisting
of single and the other consisting of partnered donors unknown
to the participant.
Body Odor Characteristics Ratings Task
The six BOs were randomly presented to participants who made
five ratings of each BO based on the following questions (variable
label in brackets): (1) How much do you like/dislike this smell?
(“
Like”
); (2) How sexy does this odor smell? (“
Sexy”
); (3) How
familiar are you with this smell? (“
Familiarity”
); (4) How strong
does this smell? (“
Strong”
) (5) How much does this odor smell
like your odor donor? (“
Similarity”
), on a 7-point scale from
zero (not at all) to six (very). The Experimenter squeezed the
bottle containing the BO three times approximately 2.5 cm from
participants’nostrils while participants inhaled through their
nose. The minimum inter-stimulus interval was 30-s. For each of
the five BO characteristics ratings, two variables were computed:
the first was the average rating given by the participant to the BO
of partnered donors and the second was the average rating given
by the participant to the BO of single donors. Therefore, a total
of 10 variables were computed. For example, for the BO “
Like”
ratings, there were two variables created: one was the BO “
Like”
rating averaged across all single donors that were rated and the
second variable created was the BO “
Like”rating averaged across
all partnered donors that were rated.
Face Characteristics Ratings Task
Participants were randomly presented with the six faces
corresponding to the six BOs selected and asked to rate each face
on eight characteristics that have been found to be universally
desired (Buss, 1989, 1994; i.e., Masculine, Good Partner, Sexy,
Intelligent, Loyal, Attractive, Kind and Trustworthy) on a scale
ranging from zero (not at all) to six (very). For each of the eight
face characteristics ratings, two variables were computed: the first
was the average rating given by the participant to the faces of
partnered donors and the second was the average rating given

by the participant to the faces of single donors. Therefore, a
total of 16 variables were computed. For example, for the face
Masculine ratings, there were two variables created: one was the
face Masculine rating averaged across all single donors that were
rated and the other was the face Masculine rating averaged across
all partnered donors that were rated.
Procedure
The
study
was
administered
by
three
different
female
Experimenters, each conducting a similar number of studies.
Preliminary Data Analysis
Note that we tested whether having a beard influenced face
masculinity ratings by comparing face masculinity scores of
donors with beards (9% of sample) and without (91% of the
sample); the results of an independent samples t-tests revealed
no significant differences between these groups (all ps > 0.05).
We also tested, but found no significant differences, between
partnered and single female participants or between females
using or not using birth contraception in terms of their ratings
of single and partnered men’
s BO and faces.
RESULTS
Were Single and Partnered Men’s BO
Rated Differently by Single and
Partnered Women?
To determine whether single and partnered female participants
rated single and partnered men’
s BO differently on five
characteristics
(i.e.,
Strong,
Like,
Sexy,
Familiarity
and
Similarity), five 2 × 2 mixed design analysis of variances
(ANOVA) were ran (see Table 1 for descriptive statistics). The
between-subjects variable in each ANOVA was Participant
Relationship
Status
(i.e.,
partnered
or
single)
and
the
within-subjects variable was Donor Relationship Status which
had two levels (i.e., partnered or single). The family-wise error
rate was adjusted for the five comparisons made such that the
alpha-level was set at 0.01 (i.e., 0.05/5).
The first ANOVA was conducted with the BO strong ratings
as the dependent variable (DV), which revealed a significant
main effect for Donor Relationship Status, F(1,77) = 9.51,
p = 0.003, ηp2 = 0.11, indicating that averaged across participants,
single men’
s BO was rated as smelling stronger than partnered
donor’
s BO. There was no significant main effect for Participant
Relationship Status, F(1,77) = 2.16, p = 0.15, ηp2 = 0.03, or
Participant Relationship Status × Donor Relationship Status
interaction (F < 1).
The next four ANOVAs revealed no significant main or
interaction effects (with 11 of 12 F-values < 1) indicating that
partnered and single women did not rate partnered and single
men’
s BO different on BO characteristic ratings of Like, Sexy,
Familiarity and Similarity.
Were Single and Partnered Men’s Faces
Rated Differently by Single and
Partnered Women?
To determine whether single and partnered female participants
rated single and partnered men’
s faces differently on eight
characteristics (i.e., Masculine, Good Partner, Sexy, Intelligent,
Loyal, Attractive, Kind, And Trustworthy), eight separate 2 × 2
mixed design analysis of variances (ANOVA) were conducted
(see Table 2 for descriptive statistics). The between-subjects
variable in each ANOVA was Participant Relationship Status (i.e.,
partnered or single) and the within-subjects variable was Donor
Relationship Status (i.e., partnered or single). The family-wise
error rate was adjusted for the eight comparisons made such that
the alpha-level was set at 0.006 (i.e., 0.05/8).
The first ANOVA was conducted with the face Masculine
ratings as the DV, revealing a significant main effect for
Donor Relationship Status, F(1,77) = 18.76, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.20

non-significant based on the adjusted alpha-level.
The next four ANOVAs conducted revealed no significant
main or interaction effects (with 8 of 12 F-values < 1) indicating
that partnered and single women did not rate partnered and
single men’
s faces different on ratings of good partner, sexy,
intelligent, and attractive.
Exploratory Analyses: Do BO Ratings
Predict Face Ratings?
In order to determine whether BO Characteristics ratings
predicted
Face
Characteristics
ratings,
a
Spearman’
s
rho
correlation analysis was conducted, which overall, revealed
favorable BO ratings (i.e., Sexy and Like) were associated with
favorable face ratings (e.g., Attractive, Intelligent; see Table 3).
For example, higher BO Like ratings were significantly correlated
with rating faces more Attractive (r = 0.29, p = 0.008), Masculine
(r = 0.30, p = 0.007), Sexy (r = 0.26, p = 0.019), and someone
who would make a Good Partner (r = 0.33, p = 0.003). The
inter-correlations among the face ratings were positive and
statistically significant (except for four); the lowest was between
Intelligent and Good Partner (r = 0.12, p = 0.30) and the
highest was between Sexy and Attractive (r = 0.89, p < 0.001).
The inter-correlations among the BO ratings were mostly
positive and statistically significant, except for those with the
Strong ratings. The lowest significant correlation was between
Familiarity and Sexy ratings (r = 0.48, p < 0.001) and the highest
was between Sexy and Like (r = 0.78, p < 0.001; see Table 3).
The ANOVA results reported above demonstrated that
partnered and single participants rated partnered and single
donors differently, specifically on the BO Strong ratings and
a subset of the face ratings (i.e., Masculine, Loyal, Kind,
and Trustworthy). Therefore, we explored the correlations
amongst the ratings indicated by the ANOVA findings to
determine the nature of the differences between partnered
and single females’ratings. This exploration revealed that the
largest discrepancies were all based on ratings of partnered
donors’ BO and faces. The largest discrepancy was the
correlation between BO Strong and Face Trustworthy ratings:
specifically, for the ratings given by partnered women, we
found a negative correlation (r = -0.35, p = 0.025) whereas
for the ratings given by single women, we found a positive
correlation (r = 0.11, p = 0.51). A Fisher’
s r-to-z transformation
comparison
test
indicated
these
two
correlations
were
significantly different (Z = 2.07), confirming that higher
BO Strong ratings were associated with lower Face Trustworthy
ratings for partnered women but no such relationship existed
for single women. While there were other similarly large
discrepancies between partnered and single participants’
ratings,
none were significantly different.
DISCUSSION
Consistent with our hypothesis, single men’
s BO was rated
as smelling stronger than the BO of partnered men. We also
found that single men’
s faces were rated as more masculine

Single and Partnered Men’s BO and Faces
than partnered men’
s faces, but only among partnered women.
Moreover, partnered women rated partnered men’
s faces
as kinder, more trustworthy and loyal than single men’
s
faces, but single females rated partnered and single men’
s
faces similarly on these characteristics. Finally, the results
showed favorable BO ratings were correlated with favorable
ratings of the corresponding faces. Although testosterone
levels were not directly tested here, the current study’
s
findings
are
congruent
with
previous
research
showing
that
single
and
partnered
males
can
be
differentiated
based on their testosterone levels (e.g., Van Anders and
Goldey, 2010), that higher testosterone levels are associated
with a stronger smelling BO (Rantala et al., 2006) and
that more intense BOs are rated more masculine smelling
(Havlíˇ
cek and Lenochova, 2006).
An obvious question is; why would a single male’
s BO
smell different from that of a partnered man’
s BO? The
social neuroendocrinology theoretical framework (van Anders
and Watson, 2006) helps frame a possible answer to this
question. Specifically, BOs are the manifestation of our current
endocrinology (e.g., low or high testosterone levels) which signal
the fitness, viability, and/or availability of a potential mate. Based
on their study’
s results, Van Anders and Goldey (2010) concluded
that single males have higher levels of testosterone than partnered
males because of the sexual competition associated with being
single and that low testosterone levels are associated with bond
maintenance. From an evolutionary perspective, it may be
advantageous for women to be able to detect the chemosignals
that connote coupledom and ultimately avoid courting partnered
males (especially with offspring) due to the relatively reduced
resources they can offer.
An alternative explanation is that single men’
s BO may
smell more intense than partnered men’
s BO because of their
poorer health and/or hygiene. Evidence for this assertion
comes from research showing single men have poorer physical
and mental health outcomes than partnered men (Hu and
Goldman, 1990) which may manifest as poorer hygiene and
therefore BO. Further evidence comes from research showing
married men are significantly more likely to seek health
care due to their wives’influence compared to unmarried
men (Norcross et al., 1996). While we found no evidence
that single men were less healthy than partnered men based
on the fact there were no significant group differences in
terms of BMI, the positive health impact of having a partner
may explain our findings.
The current study’
s finding that single men’
s faces were
rated significantly more masculine than partnered men’
s faces
(among partnered women only) is consistent with previous
research showing higher testosterone levels are associated with
more intense smelling BO (Rantala et al., 2006); especially when
considered in conjunction with the finding that single men
have higher levels of testosterone than partnered men (e.g., Van
Anders and Goldey, 2010). Given higher testosterone levels are
associated with more masculine facial features (Penton-Voak and
Chen, 2004), it is possible single males in the current sample
had higher levels of testosterone. However, a single man’
s facial
features are unlikely to change overnight unlike their relationship
status, so alternative explanations for the differences in Masculine
ratings for partnered and single men’
s faces must be considered.
While facial features do change with age, partnered males were
not older than single males so age can be ruled out as an
explanation for group differences in facial masculinity. Having a
beard was also excluded as an explanation for higher Masculine
ratings of single men’
s faces but it remains possible that individual
differences in what constitutes a “
masculine”face may, to some
extent, account for the finding.
While it is curious that only partnered women rated
single men’
s faces as more Masculine than partnered men’
s
faces,
previous
research
indicates
partnered
women
in
the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle (compared to
those in their non-fertile phase) find single men’
s faces
more attractive than partnered men’
s faces, especially if
they
are
masculine-versus
feminine-looking
(Bressan
and
Stranieri, 2008). A limitation of the current study was that
participants’menstrual cycles were not assessed so we cannot
conclude whether menstrual cycle phase influenced their
face
masculinity
ratings.
Further
limitations
include
not
supplying donors with non-perfumed body cleansing products
or specifying a specific duration of exercise, which may have
contributed to variability in the quality and nature of the
stimuli collected.
The correlations between BO and face ratings revealed a
consistent pattern of results indicating favorable BO ratings
were associated with favorable face ratings. While the current
study’
s findings are congruent with previous findings, the
positive relationship between BO and face ratings has largely
been demonstrated with female participants in the fertile
phase of their menstrual cycle (Rikowski and Grammer, 1999;
Thornhill and Gangestad, 1999). However, the correlation
between BO like ratings and face attractiveness ratings for low
fertile compared to high fertile women in both studies (i.e.,
Rikowski and Grammer, 1999; Thornhill and Gangestad, 1999)
were not significantly different, suggesting no reliable group
differences. Moreover, Allen et al. (2016) found women’
s ratings
of masculinity for men’
s BO was positively and significantly
correlated with face masculinity ratings, although the women’
s
menstrual phase was not recorded in their study, either. As
we could not compare the BO and face rating correlations
based on a participant’
s menstrual phase, it remains possible
that differences exist between the low and high fertility phases
of the menstrual cycle.
While the current results show a single man’
s BO smells
more intense and their face appears more masculine than
a partnered man’
s, the findings are preliminary and require
replication. A specific aim of future research would be to
determine whether testosterone levels are responsible for the
differences in BO and face ratings between single and partnered
men found in the current study. This could be achieved in
a single study using the same participants with the aim to
(a) replicate the finding that single men’
s BO smells more
intense than partnered men’
s BO; (b) replicate the finding that
single men’
s faces are rated more masculine than partnered
men’
s faces; (c) confirm that single men have higher levels of
testosterone than partnered men; (d) assess women’
s menstrual
