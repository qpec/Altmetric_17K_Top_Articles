Key points
r Glycogen is stored in local spatially distinct compartments within skeletal muscle fibres and is
the main energy source during supramaximal exercise.
r Using quantitative electron microscopy, we show that supramaximal exercise induces a
differential depletion of glycogen from these compartments and also demonstrate how this
varies with fibre types.
r Repeated exercise alters this compartmentalized glycogen depletion.
r The results obtained in the present study help us understand the muscle metabolic
dynamics of whole body repeated supramaximal exercise, and suggest that the muscle has
a compartmentalized local adaptation to repeated exercise, which affects glycogen depletion.
Abstract
Skeletal muscle glycogen is heterogeneously distributed in three separated
compartments (intramyofibrillar, intermyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal). Although only
constituting 3–13% of the total glycogen volume, the availability of intramyofibrillar glycogen is
of particular importance to muscle function. The present study aimed to investigate the depletion
of these three subcellular glycogen compartments during repeated supramaximal exercise in
elite athletes. Ten elite cross-country skiers (aged 25 ± 4 years, ˙
VO2max: 65 ± 4 ml kg−1 min−1;
mean ± SD) performed four �4 min supramaximal sprint time trials (STT 1–4) with 45 min
of recovery. The subcellular glycogen volumes in musculus triceps brachii were quantified from
electron microscopy images before and after both STT 1 and 4. During STT 1, the depletion of
intramyofibrillar glycogen was higher in type 1 fibres [−52%; (−89:−15%)] than type 2 fibres
[−15% (−52:22%)] (P = 0.02), whereas the depletion of intermyofibrillar glycogen [main effect:
−19% (−33:0%), P = 0.006] and subsarcolemmal glycogen [main effect: −35% (−66:0%),
P = 0.03] was similar between fibre types. By contrast, only intermyofibrillar glycogen volume
was significantly reduced during STT 4, in both fibre types [main effect: −31% (−50:−11%),
P = 0.002]. Furthermore, for each of the subcellular compartments, the depletion of glycogen
during STT 1 was associated with the volumes of glycogen before STT 1. In conclusion, the
depletion of spatially distinct glycogen compartments differs during supramaximal exercise.
Furthermore, the depletion changes with repeated exercise and is fibre type-dependent.

Introduction
Early studies have demonstrated strong associations
between the depletion of muscle glycogen and impaired
muscle function during exercise at moderate to high
intensities in humans (Bergstr¨
om et al. 1967; Hermansen
et al. 1967; Bangsbo et al. 1992). Although the detailed
mechanisms underlying this link remain unknown,
studies in both animals and humans have demonstrated
that key steps in the excitation–contraction (E–C)
coupling [i.e. sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ handling
and Na+-K+ transport] are disturbed by reductions in
muscle glycogen (James et al. 1999; Duhamel et al. 2006;
Ørtenblad et al. 2011; Gejl et al. 2014; Ørtenblad &
Nielsen 2015).
To gain insight into the role of glycogen, its sub-
cellular localization in human muscle fibres has been
examined both qualitatively (Oberholzer et al. 1976;
Sj¨
ostr¨
om et al. 1982; Frid´
en et al. 1985; Frid´
en 1989)
and semiquantitatively by transmission electron micro-
scopy (TEM) (Marchand et al. 2007; Nielsen et al. 2011).
Muscle glycogen is heterogeneously distributed between
three separated compartments: below the sarcolemma
(subsarcolemmal glycogen), between the myofibrills
(intermyofibrillar glycogen) and within the myofibrils
(intramyofibrillar glycogen) (Marchand et al. 2002).
Stereological glycogen quantification of TEM images has
revealed that highly trained endurance athletes generally
deposit 8–11% as subsarcolemmal glycogen, 77–84% as
intermyofibrillar glycogen and 3–13% as intramyofibrillar
glycogen (Nielsen et al. 2011; Nielsen et al. 2012).
Importantly, this distribution varies with training status,
in response to acute exercise (Nielsen et al. 2011) and even
between different fibre types at rest. For example, type 1
fibres from musculus triceps brachii of elite cross-country
skiers have been shown to contain twice as much intra-
myofibrillar glycogen as type 2 fibres, whereas , in the other
compartments, levels are similar (Nielsen et al. 2011).
The relative degradation of glycogen during exercise
differs between the three subcellular compartments
(Oberholzer at al. 1976; Sj¨
ostrøm et al. 1982; Frid´
en et al.
1985; Nielsen et al. 2011). This is of particular importance
because the volume of intramyofibrillar glycogen has
been shown to correlate with the SR Ca2+ release
rate subsequent to prolonged exercise and, similarly,
half-relaxation time has been shown to correlate with the
volume of intermyofibrillar glycogen in rats (Nielsen et al.
2009) (Ørtenblad et al. 2011). This emphasizes that certain
subcellular compartments of glycogen regulate important
parts of E–C coupling.
Although all glycogen compartments are reduced after
moderate to high-intensity exercise, the results of pre-
vious studies investigating their relative degradation are
inconsistent (Oberholzer at al. 1976; Sj¨
ostrøm et al.
1982; Frid´
en et al. 1985; Nielsen et al. 2011). Employing
semiquantitative
methods,
Marchand
et
al.
(2007)
demonstrated very low levels of intramyofibrillar glycogen
after exhaustive cycling exercise, and we have shown pre-
viously that, after 1 h of exhaustive exercise, the intra-
myofibrillarcompartmentisdepletedtoarelativelygreater
extent compared to glycogen in the other compartments
in both type 1 and 2 fibres (Nielsen et al. 2011). Therefore,
the link between exhaustion of endogenous glycogen
stores and muscle fatigue after prolonged exercise may
originate from the intramyofibrillar compartment. To
date, compartmentalized glycogen depletion has been
described in relation to prolonged exercise (Marchand
et al. 2007; Nielsen et al., 2011, 2012), whereas the
effects of short-term high-intensity exercise have not yet
been investigated by quantitative methods. Furthermore,
it is unclear whether the utilization of glycogen at
its various subcellular compartments during short-term
high-intensity
exercise
is
fibre
type-specific.
From
biochemical measurements of whole muscle glycogen
concentration, it has been reported that a single bout
of short-term exhaustive exercise (3–5 min) reduces the
level of glycogen by 25–35% (Essen 1978; Bangsbo et al.
1991; Bangsbo et al. 1992; Bangsbo et al. 1994; Graham
et al. 2001) and, if exercise is repeated, the depletion of
glycogen is attenuated (Karlsson & Saltin, 1971; Bangsbo
et al. 1992). Interestingly, low levels of muscle glycogen
have been associated with impairments of performance
even during short-term exhaustive exercise (Bangsbo et al.
1992; Balsom et al. 1999; Skein et al. 2012). To under-
stand how short-term high-intensity exercise influences
glycogen metabolism and muscle function, it is important
to determine the utilization of glycogen in its distinct sub-
cellular compartments during this type of exercise.
The present study therefore aimed to characterize
compartmentalized glycogen utilization by type 1 and
2 fibres during repeated supramaximal exercise in elite
athletes. On the basis of previous findings, our hypothesis
was that intramyofibrillar glycogen would be depleted
preferentially in both fibre types during supramaximal
exercise.
Methods
Ethical approval
The project was approved by the Regional Ethics
Review Board in Ume˚
a, Sweden (#2013-59-31) and
the experiments conformed with the standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects were fully informed
of any risk associated with the experiments and provided
their written consent before participation. The present
study is part of a larger project, and biopsy material from
musculus vastus lateralis was obtained contemporary with
the biopsies used here from musculus triceps brachii.

of the biopsy material from the arms were stored for
supplementary studies (Andersson et al. 2016; Gejl et al.
2016).
Study design
The effect of repeated sprint cross-country skiing on
subcellular glycogen compartmentalization was examined
in 10 elite cross-country skiers. The skiers were tested
on a treadmill in the laboratory on separate days over
3 weeks, with at least 48 h between test days (Andersson
et al. (2016)). Preliminary measurements, including
submaximal gross efficiency, height, body mass and
maximal oxygen uptake ( ˙
VO2max), were obtained during
the initial visits, whereas the final visit before the sprint
time trial (STT) performance test involved the testing
of maximal velocity and familiarization with the STT
protocol. The performance test involved four supra-
maximal 1300 m STTs (� 4 min each) interspersed
with 45 min of recovery (i.e. a simulated sprint race in
cross-country skiing) (Fig. 1). Subjects were instructed to
refrain from activities of moderate to high intensity during
the 48 h prior to testing. Dietary intake was standardized
from 24 h prior to the first STT, as well as throughout the
STT protocol.
Subjects
Ten male elite cross-country skiers participated in the
study; age 25 ± 4 years, height 183 ± 7 cm, body
mass 79.2 ± 5.9 kg, ˙
VO2max: 5.1 ± 0.5 l min−1 or
64.9 ± 4.1 ml kg−1 min−1 with diagonal stride (DIA)
and 5.0 ± 0.5 l min−1 or 62.5 ± 4.2 ml kg−1 min−1 with
the double-pooling technique (DP) (mean ± SD). Muscle
tissue from musculus triceps brachii contained 39 ± 6%
myosin heavy chain (MHC) type 1 fibres and 62 ± 6%
MHC type 2 fibres (mean ± SD). Skiers participated in
national and/or international sprint and distance races
and trained 8–11 h per week during the testing period. All
participants had experienced treadmill roller skiing.
Race simulation
The race simulation consisted of four successive 1300 m
STTs (�4 min each), interspersed with 45 min of recovery
with carbohydrate intake (CHO) (see below). A 5 min
warm-up and 5 min cool-down were performed before
and after each STT. Each 1300 m STT consisted of three
DP sections (1°) and two DIA sections (7°), and skiers
were encouraged to perform maximally during each trial.
Treadmill velocity and ˙
VO2 were monitored continuously
during the four STTs, and the data were averaged. Heart
rate was measured continuously throughout each STT and
blood lactate was collected from the fingertip at 1 min
following each STT. Room temperature (�22°C) and
humidity(�56%)weremaintainedthroughoutthecourse
of the experiment.
Estimation of aerobic and anaerobic energy
contributions
The modified gross efficiency (GE) method was used
to estimate the supramaximal O2 deficit during STT
1–4. The supramaximal GE was estimated based on
extrapolation of the submaximal relationships for skiing
velocity and incline vs. GE during the preliminary test
(Anderssonetal.2016).Theserelationshipswerethenused
to estimate the supramaximal GE during STT 1–4. The
total metabolic rate required during the STT was obtained
by dividing the supramaximal power output by the GE
and converting it to a ˙
VO2 requirement. The O2 deficit
was then computed by subtracting the accumulated ˙
VO2
from the accumulated ˙
VO2 requirement (Andersson et al.
2016).
Dietary restrictions
Dietary intake was controlled and calculated throughout
the experiments, based on body mass. Subjects received
standardized CHO-enriched meals [three meals and three
snacks; 8 g of CHO (kg body weight−1) day−1] during

the 24 h prior to the race simulation. On average,
the meals contained 18 000 kJ (55% carbohydrates,
30% fat and 15% protein). The last meal was consumed
upon reporting to the laboratory 120 min before the
warm-up. In each of the three recovery periods from
STT 1 to 4, subjects received CHO beverages and energy
gels, ensuring that they consumed 1.2 g CHO (kg body
weight−1) h−1. On average, subjects consumed 70 g of
carbohydrates during the 45 min recovery period (40 g
of sport drink mixed with water and 30 g of energy
gel), in addition to water ad libitum. This CHO intake
correspondedtotherecommendationsfromtheAmerican
College of Sports Medicine (Rodriguez et al. 2009).
Maximal oxygen uptake
Respiratory
variables
were
measured
using
an
ergospirometry system (AMIS 2001 model C; Innovision
A/S, Odense, Denmark). The gas analysers were calibrated
with a mixture of 16.0% O2 and 4.0% CO2 (Air Liquide,
Kungs¨
angen, Sweden) and calibration of the flow meter
was performed at low, medium and high flow rates,
with a 3 L air syringe (Hans Rudolph, Kansas City,
MO, USA). Ambient conditions were monitored with
an external apparatus (Vaisala PTU 200; Vaisala Oy,
Helsinki, Finland). Blood samples (20 μl) were obtained
from the fingertip and used for determining blood lactate
concentration by Biosen 5140 (EKF Diagnostic GmbH,
Magdeburg, Germany). This apparatus was calibrated
with a standard solution of lactate (12 mmol l−1) prior
to each analysis. Heart rate was measured continuously
throughout the tests, using a heart rate monitor (S810;
Polar Electro OY, Kempele, Finland).
Two incremental roller skiing
˙
VO2max
tests were
performed in a random order and at different slopes, with
either DP or DIA (DP at 1° and DIA at 7°). The two tests
were separated by a 5 min cool-down and a 15 min passive
recovery. The ˙
VO2max tests started at 21 km h–1 during
DP and at 9 km h–1 during DIA. The velocity was then
increased by 1 km h−1 every 60 s until exhaustion in DP,
and by 0.5 km h−1 every 45 s until exhaustion in DIA. The
average of the three highest 10 s consecutive values was
analysed to determine ˙
VO2max with each technique. Blood
lactate was collected from the fingertip at 1, 3 and 10 min,
respectively, on completion of the test.
Muscle biopsies
In the present study, tissue was obtained from arm muscle
(musculus triceps brachii) before and after the first and
fourth STT (Fig. 1) because this muscle is highly active
during cross-country skiing (Holmberg et al. 2005). The
Bergstr¨
om needle biopsy technique was used to obtain
muscle samples from the mid-section of the musculus
triceps brachii (in a random order of the left and right
arm) at near identical depth and vicinity of location. The
pre-STT 1 biopsy was obtained 20 min before STT 1,
and the post-biopsies were obtained immediately after
STT 1 and STT 4 (within 5 min post-race). The pre-STT 4
biopsy was obtained 10–12 min before STT 4 (i.e. prior
to warm-up). The muscle sample was placed on a filter
paper, on an ice-cooled �0°C Petri dish, and divided
into five specimens. For the purpose of the present study,
one part was used for TEM imaging and another part for
determining fibre type distribution.
MHC distribution
MHC composition was determined from homogenate
using gel electrophoresis as described previously (Danieli
Betto et al. 1986) and modified for humans (Ørtenblad
2000). In brief, muscle homogenate (80 μL) was mixed
with 200 μL of sample-buffer (10% glycerol, 5%
2-mercaptoethanol and 2.3% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris and
0.2% bromophenolblue at pH 6.8.), boiled in water
for 3 min, and loaded with three different quantities
of protein (10–40μL) on a SDS-PAGE gel [6% poly-
acrylmide (100:1 acrylmid:bis-acrylmid), 30% glycerol,
67.5 mM Tris-base, 0.4% SDS and 0.1 M glycine]. Gels
were run at 80 V for at least 42 h at 4 °C and MHC
bands made visible by staining them with Coomassie.
The gels were scanned (Linoscan 1400 scanner; Linoscan
Heidelberg, Germany) and MHC bands were quantified
densiometrically (Phoretix 1D, non-linear; Phoretix Inter-
national Ltd, Newcastle, UK) as an average of the two to
three loaded protein amounts, giving clear MHC bands.
MHC II was identified by western blotting, using mono-
clonal antibody (M 4276; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA),
with the protocol Xcell IITM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA).
TEM
Muscle biopsy specimens were prepared for glycogen
visualization using TEM, as described previously (Nielsen
et al. 2010). In brief, specimens were fixed with
2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer
(pH 7.3) for 24 h, and subsequently rinsed four times
in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. After rinsing, muscle
specimens were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide
(OsO4) and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide [K4Fe(CN)6]
in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 90 min at 4 °C. After
post-fixation, the muscle specimens were rinsed twice
in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer at 4 °C, dehydrated
through a graded series of alcohol at 4–20 °C, infiltrated
with graded mixtures of propylene oxide and Epon at
20 °C and embedded in 100% Epon at 30 °C. Ultrathin
sections were cut in three depths separated by 150 nm
to obtain as many fibres as possible (Ultracut UCT
ultramicrotome; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).

Local muscle glycogen depletion with supramaximal exercise

The sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate, and photographed with a pre-calibrated EM
208 transmission electron microscope (Philips, Eindoven,
The Netherlands) and a Megaview III FW camera
(Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions, M¨
unster, Germany).
All longitudinally-orientated fibres from each depth were
included, resulting in an average of of seven fibres per
biopsy (range: 6–11). Twenty-four fibres images were
obtained from each fibre at 10 000× magnification, in
a random systematic order, including 12 from the sub-
sarcolemmal region and six from both the superficial and
the central region of the myofibrillar space. The variation
in the parameters between images was used to estimate a
coefficient of error (estCE), as proposed for stereological
ratio estimates by Howard and Reed (2005). Based on
intermyofibrillar mitochondrial volume and Z-line width,
myofibres were classified as being type 1 or 2 (Sj¨
ostr¨
om
et al. 1982). Intermyofibrillar mitochondrial volume was
plotted against Z-line width from all fibres (n = 4–11)
from each biopsy. The fibres thereafter demonstrating the
highest mitochondria volume fraction and thickest Z-line
width wereclassified as type1fibres,and viceversafor type
2 fibres. Only distinct type 1 and 2 fibres were included,
whereas intermediate fibres were discarded. In the final
analysis, two or three fibres of each type were analysed per
biopsy, except in the case of one biopsy, where only one
type 2 fibre was clear enough for analysis. All analyses were
carried out by the same investigator. Unfortunately, two
samples were mixed during preparation and one sample
failed quality control. Glycogen volume and particle size
in the three compartments were therefore only estimated
in nine and eight subjects before and after STT 4,
respectively.
Glycogen quantification
To validate the stereological quantification of glycogen,
inter-investigator variability between the present investi-
gator and an investigator possessing great experience
with the quantification of glycogen from TEM images
was evaluated. There was no large bias between the two
investigators (<5%) and the coefficient of variation was
low (<5%), having being evaluated as proposed by Bland
& Altman (1986).
Within the myofibre, glycogen was quantified into three
distinct localizations: (1) the intermyofibrillar space; (2)
the intramyofibrillar space; and (3) the subsarcolemmal
space. Based on stereological counting of glycogen in
each space, and by taking section thickness into account,
glycogen volume fraction (Vv) was calculated as proposed
by Weibel: Vv = AA – t {(1/π)·BA – NA·[(t·H)/(t + H)]},
where AA is glycogen area fraction, t is the section
thickness (60 nm), BA is the glycogen boundary length
density, NA is the number of particles per area and
H is the average glycogen particle diameter (Weibel
1980). Glycogen particles were assumed to be spherical
(Melendez-Hevia et al. 1993). The glycogen area fraction
was estimated by point counting, and the average glycogen
molecule diameter was measured using iTEM, version
5.0 (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions). Intermyofibrillar
glycogen was expressed relative to the myofibrillar space,
and counted with a grid size of 180 and 300 nm,
respectively. The myofibrillar space consists of myofibrils
(intramyofibrillar space), mitochondria, SR, t-system and
lipids). The intramyofibrillar glycogen was expressed
relative to the intramyofibrillar space and counted with
a grid size of 60 and 180 nm, respectively. The sub-
sarcolemmal glycogen was expressed relative to the muscle
fibre surface (estimated from direct length measurement)
providing assurance that the results were unbiased,
from differences in other subsarcolemmal organelles (e.g.
mitochondria, nuclei and lipids). Grid size during the
counting of subsarcolemmal glycogen was 180 nm. In
muscle fibres with high glycogen volumes, we often
observed a clustering of intermyofibrillar glycogen, with
glycogen particles covering each other. We therefore
investigated the potential underestimation of glycogen
volume
by
plotting
the
different
subfractions
of
glycogen in type 1 and 2 fibres against whole muscle
glycogen concentration. This revealed an underestimation
of intermyofibrillar glycogen volume in type 1 fibres in
muscles with high glycogen concentrations. Therefore, all
intermyofibrillar glycogen volumes were corrected for this
underestimation by extrapolating the linear relationship
observed at moderate glycogen concentrations to high
glycogen concentrations.
The variation in the parameters between images was
used to estimate a coefficient of error (estCE) as proposed
forstereologicalratio-estimatesbyHoward&Reed(2005).
The
estCE were 0.13, 0.17 and 0.20, respectively, in
intermyofibrillar, intramyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal
glycogen.
Quantification
of
total
glycogen
volume
from electron microscopy pictures was weighed and
based on individual fibre type distribution. Glycogen
quantifications from homogenates and electron micro-
scopy images were well associated (r2 = 0.48, P < 0.05)
(Fig. 2).
Biochemical determination of muscle glycogen
Total
muscle
glycogen
content
was
determined
spectrophotometrically (DU 650; Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, CA, USA). Freeze dried muscle tissue (1.5 mg)
was boiled in 0.5 ml of 1 M HCL for 150 min, before
it was rapidly cooled, whirl-mixed and centrifuged at
3500 g for 10 min at 4 ºC. Next, 40 μl of boiled
muscle sample and 1 ml of reagent solution containing
Tris-buffer (1 M), distilled water, ATP (100 mM), MgCl2
(1
M), NADP+ (100 mM) and glucose 6-phosphate
dehydrogenase were mixed before the process was initiated

by adding 10 μl of diluted hexokinase. Absorbance was
recorded for 60 min before the glycogen content was
calculated. Muscle glycogen was expressed as mmol kg dry
weight–1.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata, version
13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). All
interactions or main effects were tested using a linear
mixed-effects model, with subjects and time as random
effects and with time and fibre type as fixed effects.
Variables with skewed distributions were log-transformed
before analysis. Associations between variables were
evaluated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Values
are presented as geometric means and 95% confidence
intervals (CI), unless stated otherwise. The significance
level was set at α = 0.05.
Results
Performance and energy contribution
Completion time, average heart rate, acute lactate
concentrations and contribution from aerobic and
anaerobic metabolism to energy production during each
STT are shown in Fig. 1. These data have previously been
published elsewhere, and are included to characterize the
work load employed (Andersson et al. 2016). Biochemical
measurement showed that total muscle glycogen was
reduced by 22% (−129 mmol kg dry weight−1) and 24%
(−93 mmol kg dry weight−1), respectively, during STT 1
and STT 4 (575 ± 14 to 446 ± 16 mmol kg dry weight−1

Subcellular distribution of glycogen prior to exercise
Before exercise, the total muscle glycogen volume
did not differ between fibre types. However, type
1 fibres contained more intramyofibrillar glycogen
[+24%, (3:46%); P = 0.02], with there being no
difference in the case of intermyofibrillar and sub-
sarcolemmal
glycogen.

Utilization of glycogen subfractions during
supramaximal exercise (STT 1)
Intramyofibrillar glycogen volume decreased in type 1
fibres(−52%[−89:–15%]),butnotintype2fibres[−15%
(−52:22%); time × fibre type interaction: P = 0.02]. By
contrast, intermyofibrillar glycogen volume was reduced
in both fibre types [type 1: −15% (−32:1%); type 2:
–23% (−39:−7%); main effect: −19% (−33:0), P = 0.006;
time × fibre type interaction: P = 0.41] (Fig. 4A and
B), as was the level of subsarcolemmal glycogen volume
[type 1: −29% (−69:11%); type 2: −42% (−81:−2%);
main effect: −35% (−66:0%), P = 0.03; time × fibre type
interaction: P = 0.62] (Fig. 4C).
The fibre type-specific utilization of intramyofibrillar
glycogen during STT 1 was further emphasized by the
observation of intramyofibrillar glycogen being used to
a relatively large extent in comparison to the other
compartments in type 1 fibres but not in type 2 fibres
(P = 0.01) (Table 1).
Utilization of glycogen compartments during
subsequent supramaximal exercise (STT 4)
During STT 4, the overall volume of intermyofibrillar
glycogen was reduced by 31% [type 1: −55% (−60:
−11%); type 2: –26% (−50:−1%); main effect: −31%
(−50:−11%), P = 0.002; time × fibre type interaction:
P = 0.24] (Fig. 5A), whereas intramyofibrillar and sub-
sarcolemmal glycogen volumes were not significantly
altered (Fig. 5B and C). Accordingly, the relative
distribution between the three glycogen compartments
changed in a similar manner in the two fibre types during
STT 4, with both demonstrating that intermyofibrillar
glycogen was depleted preferentially (Table 1).
An evaluation of the overall effect of the 4 repeated
sprints reveals that, independent of fibre type each of the
subcellular compartments were reduced from pre STT 1 to
post STT 4 (P < 0.0001) (Figs 4 and 5) and that the relative
distribution of glycogen between the three compartments
was not significantly changed (Table 1).

Relationship between pre-exercise glycogen
availability and net glycogen depletion
No associations between the biochemically-measured
baseline concentration of glycogen and glycogen depletion
(pre – post) were observed in neither STT 1 (r2 = 0.12,
P = 0.33), nor STT 4 (r2 = 0.04, P = 0.63). However, when
data from both STT 1 and STT 4 were combined, there
was a weak association (r2 = 0.26, P = 0.03). By contrast,
in each of the compartments and in both fibre types, the
glycogen depletion (pre – post) was closely associated with
the glycogen volume before the exercise in STT 1 but not
in STT 4 (Figs 6 and 7).
Particle volume
During STT 1, the volume of intermyofibrillar and sub-
sarcolemmal glycogen particles declined in a fibre type
independent manner [−18% (−31:−5%), P = 0.006;
−15% (−35:4), P = 0.02, respectively], with there
being a similar tendency in the case of intramyofibrillar
glycogen particles [−13% (−27:1%), P = 0.075] (Table 2).
In STT 4, the volume of intermyofibrillar and intra-
myofibrillar glycogen particles in both fibre types were
significantlyreduced[−20%(−38:−1%),P=0.04;−18%
(−34:−1%), P = 0.04, respectively], with there being a
similar tendency in the case of subsarcolemmal glycogen
particles[−16%(−34:1%),P=0.07](Table2).Inallthree
glycogen compartments, the volume of glycogen particles
was 16–20% larger in type 2 compared to type 1 fibres
both before and after STT 4 (Table 2).
Glycogen particle volume was significantly reduced in
all subcellular compartments of both fibre types from
pre STT 1 to post STT 4 (−26 to −42%; P < 0.0001)
(Table 2). However, the volumes of intermyofibrillar and
intramyofibrillar glycogen particles were reduced to a
greater extent in type 1 fibres (38% and 42%, respectively)
than in type 2 fibres (26% and 32%, respectively), whereas

Discussion
In the present study, we have demonstrated that 4 min of
exercise at supramaximal intensity resulted in a marked
reduction in the volume of intramyofibrillar glycogen in
type 1 fibres only, whereas the volumes of intermyofibrillar
and subsarcolemmal glycogen were reduced to the same
extent in both fibre types. Thus, with this type of supra-
maximal exercise, the two main fibre types of human
skeletal muscles show differential utilization of spatially
distinct glycogen stores. Interestingly, following STT 2 and
3 and the subsequent 45 min recovery periods, this fibre
type difference disappeared during the subsequent fourth
STT, where both type 1 and type 2 fibres utilized inter-
myofibrillar glycogen preferentially. Consequently, the
alterations in the relative distribution of glycogen between
subcellular compartments observed following STT 1 were
no longer evident after STT 4 where the distribution had
returned to resting condition (pre-STT 1).
Therefore,
the
hypothesis
that
intramyofibrillar
glycogen would be used preferentially during supra-
maximal exercise was confirmed in type 1 fibres, although
not in type 2 fibres and not with repeated sprint exercise in
either type 1 or 2 fibres. Because the hypothesis was based
on a preferential utilization of intramyofibrillar glycogen
during prolonged (�1 h) high-intensity exercise (Nielsen
et al. 2011), and because intramyofibrillar glycogen was
used to a lesser extent during STT 4, these results indicate

that the use of intramyofibrillar glycogen in type 1 fibres
during high-intensity exercise generally occurs during the
first period of exercise, with a subsequent levelling-off.
In the present study, the average rate of reduction in
intramyofibrillar glycogen volume in type 1 fibres was
0.48 μm3 μm−3 103 min−1 during STT 1, whereas 60 min
of exhaustive cross-country skiing revealed a markedly
lower reduction rate of only 0.10 μm3 μm−3 103 min−1
(Nielsen et al. 2011). This marked difference is not only
explainedbydissimilaritiesinexerciseintensityandenergy
demands, but also perhaps by a gradual reduction in the
utilization rate of glycogen as exercise progresses and the
availability of intramyofibrillar glycogen is considerably
reduced. In line with this, the results from STT 4 show
that the contribution from intramyofibrilar glycogen in
type 1 fibres was markedly reduced as exercise progressed
(0.04 μm3 μm−3 103 min−1).
The 22% lower resting volume of intramyofibrillar
glycogen in type 2 fibres compared to type 1 fibres
could at least partly explain why there was only a small
non-significant reduction in this subfraction of type 2
fibres during STT 1. This basal fibre type difference in
intramyfibrillar glycogen volume was also reported in
our previous study in cross-country skiers (Nielsen et al.
2011), and it probably affects the rate of reduction in
intramyofibrillar glycogen volume. It has been suggested
that the subcellular glycogen phosphorylation rate is
dependent upon the glycogen availability (Hespel &
Richter, 1992) and this could explain why type 2 fibres
demonstrate a less pronounced rate of reduction in intra-
myofibrillar glycogen volume compared to type 1 fibres
(Figs 4, 5, 6 and 7).
Overall, we observed an attenuation of glycogen
utilization from STT 1 to STT 4, in agreement with
previous studies involving repeated exercise (Karlsson &
Saltin, 1971; Bangsbo et al. 1992), and which might be
related to a lower initial glycogen availability. Certain
earlier studies have reported positive associations between

et al. 1995; Arkinstall et al. 2004), although Bangsbo et al.
(1992) found no such association. In the present study,
there was no association between biochemically-measured
glycogen concentration and glycogen breakdown when
investigating STT 1 and 4 separately, although there was a
weak association when these data were combined. Inter-
estingly, we observed strong associations between the
availability of glycogen in all subcellular pools prior to
STT 1 and subsequent glycogen utilization in both type
1 and 2 fibres (Figs 6 and 7). However, these associations
were no longer present during STT 4. The lack of signi-
ficant associations between glycogen availability and the
breakdown of it during STT 4 could be explained by
a narrow spectrum of both glycogen depletion and
pre-exercise glycogen volume of STT 4 compared to STT 1
(Figs 6 and 7).
Interestingly, the relative distribution of glycogen
between the three compartments returned to the resting
condition following STT 4, so that, despite fluctuations
during STT 1, the overall relative glycogen utilization
in the subcellular compartments was identical during
STT 1–4. This re-setting to resting conditions was
caused by preservation of intramyofibrillar and sub-
sarcolemmal glycogen during STT 4 and, consequently,
intermyofibrillar glycogen was consumed preferentially.
Therefore, the attenuation of whole muscle glycogen
utilization (as measured biochemically) observed during
the fourth STT can be ascribed to a lower degree
of utilization of intramyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal
glycogen. Because the overall metabolic rate during STT
1 and STT 4 did not vary (Andersson et al. 2016),
this attenuation of glycogen utilization must be the
result of either a change in the anaerobic/aerobic energy
production ratio (i.e. ATP production per mM glycogen)
or the replacement of glycogen by another substrate. There
was no difference in the blood lactate levels after STT 1
and 4, or in the relative contribution of anaerobic energy
production to the overall energy requirements (Fig. 1),
indicating that the attenuation of glycogen utilization
cannot be explained by a change in the anaerobic/aerobic
energy production ratio. The possibility of a higher
turnover of other substrates during the fourth STT was
not investigated in the present study. However, Sahlin et al.
(1997) have demonstrated a 13% overshoot in creatine
phosphate (CrP) of type 1 fibres following 5 min recovery
from fatiguing exercise. Interestingly, creatine kinase is
located in the M-band within the intramyofibrillar space,
where it has been shown to be functionally coupled to the
myosin ATPase (Ventura-Calpier et al. 1998). That means
that an increased availability of CrP could potentially
reduce the amount of glycogen phosphorylation needed
to meet the energy requirements from the myosin ATPase
during exercise, thus sparing intramyofibrillar glycogen.
Type 2 fibres have been shown to contain �20% more
CrP compared to type 1 fibres (Sahlin et al. 1997), which
may explain the difference in intramyofibrillar glycogen
availability and utilization during STT 1. In addition to
CrP, a higher glucose uptake and oxidation with repeated
exercise could also explain the sparing of both intra-
myofibrillar and subsarcolemmal glycogen during STT 4
(Marliss et al. 1991).
Implications for muscle function
Previous studies have suggested that depletion of total
glycogen concentration to below �250–300 mmol kg dry
weight−1 (Bangsbo et al. 1992; Duhamel et al. 2006a;
Duhamel et al. 2006b; Ørtenblad et al. 2011; Gejl et al.

2014) or of intramyofibrillar glycogen volume to below
2–3 μm3 μm−3 103 (Nielsen et al. 2009; Ørtenblad et al.
2011; Nielsen et al. 2014) impairs muscle performance.
At no point during the present study did either of these
parameters fall below these critical levels, which explains
why performance was maintained during the repeated
time trials (Fig. 1). Importantly, during the 45 min
recovery periods between time trials, the athletes ingested
a high amount of carbohydrates, which probably led
to significant re-synthesis of glycogen, thereby avoiding
extensive net depletion during the time course of the
repeated time trials (Van Hall et al. 2000). By contrast,
Bangsbo et al. (1992) observed a reduction in time to
exhaustion during a second bout of one-legged knee
extension exercise, when subjects consumed only water
during recovery, under which circumstances glycogen
concentration was reduced below the critical limit
(�200 mmol kg dry weight−1).
All subcellular glycogen compartments can be depleted
to lower levels than observed in the present study, and
eventually impair the E–C coupling and muscle function
(Nielsen et al. 2011; Ørtenblad et al. 2011; Nielsen et al.
2012). The preservation of intramyofibrillar and sub-
sarcolemmal glycogen during STT 4 could be interpreted
as a safety mechanism to avoid critical reductions in these
subfractions. The exact role(s) of glycogen in maintaining
muscle function remain to be fully clarified. However, low
intramyofibrillar glycogen volume has been shown to be
associated with a reduced SR Ca2+ release rate (Nielsen
et al. 2009; Ørtenblad et al. 2011; Nielsen et al. 2014)
and intermyofibrillar glycogen is associated with SR Ca2+
uptake (Nielsen et al. 2009). The subsarcommal glycogen
compartment is suggested to carry out other roles in the
E–C coupling including support both the active ion trans-
port across the sarcolemma and the superficial part of
the contractile apparatus close to the surface membrane
(Frid´
en et al. 1985; Frid´
en et al. 1989).
Glycogen particle volume
The relationship between glycogen particle volume and
its content of glycosyl units is slightly exponential when
investigating particles in a wide spectra of volumes
(500–40 000 nm3) (Shearer & Graham 2004). When
comparing alterations in particle volume between very
small and very big particles, one must therefore take into
account that large particles contain more glycosyl units
per volume. However, in the present study, 95% of all
values were within the range 4.930–17.275 nm3. Within
this range, the relationship between particle volume and
the content of glycosyl unit is linear, as shown previously
by Shearer and Graham (2004). This linear assumption
is further supported by the observed linear relationship
between biochemically measured glycogen concentration
and total glycogen volume estimated by the electron
microscopy method (r2 = 0.48, P < 0.05) (Fig. 2).
However,amajorlimitationoftheTEMmethodemployed
in the present study is the inability to detect glycogen
particles smaller than �10 nm, demonstrating that the
estimate of the average glycogen particle volume is semi-
quantitative and represents only the visible particles.
However, because the small particles only contribute with
a very little amount of glycogen, the inability to detect
the small particles does not compromise the estimate of
glycogen volume (Shearer and Graham 2004).
In the present study, we show that exercise reduces the
size of the glycogen particles at all subcellular locations
and in both fibre types (Table 2), in agreement with pre-
vious observations (Marchand et al. 2007; Nielsen et al.
2012). A full understanding of whether glycogen depletion
is ascribed by a homogenous and partly degradation
of all particles or a heterogeneous pattern where only
some particles are fully degraded (loss of particles) is
beyond the scope of the present investigation as a result
of the above mentioned methodological limitations. The
much larger decrements in glycogen volume than particle
volume within the intramyofibrillar space (in type 1 fibres
only) and subsarcolemmal space during STT 1 and within
the intermyofibrillar space during STT 4 can therefore be
explained by a degradation of some particles below our
detection limit.
Despitenosignificantdepletionofintramyofibrillarand
subsarcolemmal glycogen volume during STT 4 (Fig. 5),
there was a decrease in the size of the glycogen particles
(Table 2). This mismatch can be explained by a higher
statisticalprecisionoftheestimatesofparticlevolumethan
glycogen volume, although it also suggests that both intra-
myofibrillar and subsarcolemmal glycogen were indeed
utilized during STT 4. However, the decrease in the relative
contribution of intermyofibrillar glycogen volume to total
glycogen volume (Table 1) still demonstrates a preferential
depletion of this subfraction during STT 4.
Interestingly,beforeSTT4,theglycogenparticlevolume
of all three compartments was �16% smaller in type 1
fibres compared to type 2 fibres (Table 2). Because the
glycogen volume and the reduction in particle volume
during the exercise bouts were not different between
fibre types, this indicates fibre type-specific strategies
for glycogen re-synthesis during the recovery periods.
Although type 2 fibres appear to enhance the size of
particles, type 1 fibres prioritize to enhance the number of
glycogen particles. Interestingly, rodent type 1 fibres were
reported to contain four-fold more glycogen branching
enzyme than rodent type 2 fibres (Murphy et al. 2012),
which would give a more glucose-dense packed glycogen
particle with fewer tiers and a poorer capacity for storing
glucose (Mel´
endez-Hevia et al. 1993) and, in turn, a
need for a higher number of particles. At baseline,
however, the glycogen particles of type 1 fibres were
only marginally smaller than those of type 2 fibres, so

future studies should investigate the roles of exercise
and post-exercise recovery, as well as the interaction
with different fibre types on glycogen particle size and
glycogen associated proteins (i.e. glycogen branching
enzyme).
Conclusions
In conclusion, a semi-quantitative estimation of local
glycogen depletion in muscle subcellular compartments
during
supramaximal
exercise
revealed
that
intra-
myofibrillar glycogen was depleted in type 1 fibres but
not in type 2 fibres, whereas intermyofibrillar and sub-
sarcolemmal glycogen were depleted to the same extent
in both fibre types. If exercise was repeated, inter-
myofibrillar glycogen was preferentially depleted in both
fibre types during the fourth sprint, resulting in similar
overall relative reductions in all subcellular compartments
during STT 1–4. This shift in local glycogen depletion
from different compartments indicates the existence of
a mechanism, which, during repeated supramaximal
exercise or cumulated exercise, regulates the spatial
depletion of glycogen. Because the spatial distribution of
glycogen in skeletal muscle fibres is important for muscle
function, such a mechanism may influence the role of
glycogen during exercise.
