Deaths from unintentional injuries are the seventh leading 
cause of death among older adults (1), and falls account for 
the largest percentage of those deaths. Approximately one 
in four U.S. residents aged ≥65 years (older adults) report 
falling each year (2), and fall-related emergency department 
visits are estimated at approximately 3 million per year.* In 
2016, a total of 29,668 U.S. residents aged ≥65 years died as 
the result of a fall (age-adjusted rate† = 61.6 per 100,000), 
compared with 18,334 deaths (47.0) in 2007. To evaluate 
this increase, CDC produced age-adjusted rates and trends for 
deaths from falls among persons aged ≥65 years, by selected 
characteristics (sex, age group, race/ethnicity, and urban/rural 
status) and state from 2007 to 2016. The rate of deaths from 
falls increased in the United States by an average of 3.0% per 
year during 2007–2016, and the rate increased in 30 states and 
the District of Columbia (DC) during that period. In eight 
states, the rate of deaths from falls increased for a portion of the 
study period. The rate increased in almost every demographic 
category included in the analysis, with the largest increase per 
year among persons aged ≥85 years. Health care providers 
should be aware that deaths from falls are increasing nationally 
among older adults but that falls are preventable. Falls and fall 
prevention should be discussed during annual wellness visits, 
when health care providers can assess fall risk, educate patients 
about falls, and select appropriate interventions.
Mortality data from death certificates filed in 50 states and 
DC were analyzed to determine the number of deaths from 
falls among persons aged ≥65 years by selected characteristics, 
year, and state in which the death occurred. Each certificate 
identifies demographic data and a single underlying cause of 
death. Falls were identified using International Classification 
of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes W00–W19. Queries to CDC

and age-adjusted rates by sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, American Indian/Alaska Native, 
Asian/Pacific Islander, or Hispanic), and urban/rural status.¶

§ Joinpoint regression examining changes in trends indicated that, from 2007 to 2016, the District of Columbia and 30 states had significant increases in the rate of deaths 
from falling (Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and 
Wyoming). Colorado, Oregon, and Tennessee had initial increases, followed by stable rates during this period. Arizona, Nevada, and Wisconsin had an initial period of 
stability followed by a significant increase. In Missouri, there was a decrease from 2007 to 2012, followed by an increase from 2012 to 2016. In Utah there was an increase 
from 2007 to 2012 followed by a decrease to 2016. Eleven states had nonsignificant trends during this period (Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nebraska, 
New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, and Vermont). Alaska did not have enough data to examine trends.

The largest AAPC in mortality rates from falls (11.0% per 
year) occurred in Maine, followed by Oklahoma (10.9%) and 
West Virginia (7.8%). A significant increase in the rate from 
2007 to 2016 occurred in 30 states (Arkansas, California, 
Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, 
South Carolina, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, West 
Virginia, and Wyoming) and DC. No significant change in 
fall mortality rates occurred in 11 states (Alabama, Delaware, 
Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, and Vermont). After an initial 
increase, rates stabilized in three states (Colorado, Oregon, and 
Tennessee). Arizona, Nevada, and Wisconsin had initial peri-
ods of stability followed by a significant increase in fall death 
rates. The death rate from falls decreased in Missouri during 
2007–2012, followed by an increase during 2012–2016, and 
increased in Utah during 2007–2012, followed by a decrease 
during 2012–2016.
In 2016, death rates from falls were higher among adults 
aged ≥85 years (257.9), men (72.3), and whites (68.7) than 
among corresponding groups (Table). From 2007 to 2016, 
rates increased among all demographic subgroups except 
American Indians/Alaska Natives. The annual rate increase 
was larger among adults aged ≥85 years (3.9% per year) than 
among those aged 65–74 years (1.8%) and 75–84 years (2.3%).
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among 
persons aged ≥65 years, and the age-adjusted rate of deaths 
from falls is increasing.
What is added by this report?
The rate of deaths from falls among persons aged ≥65 years 
increased 31% from 2007 to 2016, increasing in 30 states and 
the District of Columbia, and among men and women. Among 
states in 2016, rates ranged from 24.4 per 100,000 (Alabama) to 
142.7 (Wisconsin). The fastest-growing rate was among persons 
aged ≥85 years (3.9% per year).
What are the implications for public health practice?
As the U.S. population aged ≥65 years increases, health care 
providers can address the rising number of deaths from falls in 
this age group by asking about fall occurrences, assessing gait 
and balance, reviewing medications, and prescribing interven-
tions such as strength and balance exercises or physical therapy.

Discussion
Approximately 30,000 adults aged ≥65 years died as the 
result of a fall in 2016, and state-specific rates for deaths from 
falls ranged from 24.4 per 100,000 in Alabama to 142.7 in 
Wisconsin. The rate of deaths from falls among older adults 
increased steadily from 2007 to 2016 in 30 states and DC. 
The 31% increase in the national rate of deaths from falls from 
2007 to 2016 is consistent with findings from a 2010 study 
that estimated a 42% increase from 2000 to 2006 (3).
The differences in rates among states might have resulted, 
in part, from differences in the racial composition or general 
health of the states’ residents. For example, in 2016, the rate 
of deaths from falls was higher among older white adults than 
among other racial/ethnic groups. Thus, the higher rate in 
Wisconsin, compared with that in Alabama, might be partially 
attributable to a higher proportion of white older adults in 
Wisconsin than in Alabama.§§ Differential coding practices 
for external causes of injury on the death certificate might 
also contribute to variation in both the rate and APC (4,5). In 
addition, some states require a medical examiner to complete a 
death certificate, whereas others employ coroners; a 2012 study 
of national trends and coding patterns in fall-related mortality 
among the elderly found that coroners recorded 14% fewer 
deaths from falls than did medical examiners (5).
In 2016, there was a higher rate of fatal falls among older 
men, in contrast to the rate of nonfatal falls, which is higher 
among older women (2). This might have resulted from differ-
ences in the circumstance of a fall (e.g., from a ladder or while 
drinking) (6,7), leading to more serious injuries, including head 
trauma, or higher rates of postfall complications in men (7). 
The higher rates of deaths from falls among older age groups 
is consistent with advancing age being an independent risk 
factor for falls as well as being associated with other risk factors 
such as 1) reduced activity; 2) chronic conditions, including 
arthritis, neurologic disease, and incontinence; 3) increased use 
of prescription medications, which might act synergistically 
on the central nervous system; and 4) age-related changes in 
gait and balance (8).
The population of older adults in the United States is increas-
ing; adults aged ≥85 years are the fastest-growing age group 
among U.S. residents and will reach approximately 8.9 million 
in 2030 (9). Although the rate of deaths from falls is increas-
ing among all persons aged ≥65 years, it is increasing fastest 
among those aged ≥85 years (3.9% per year). Nationally, the 
rate of deaths from falls might be increasing because of longer 
 
§§ https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.
xhtml?pid=ACS_16_5YR_DP05&src=pt.
survival after the onset of common diseases such as heart dis-
ease, cancer, and stroke (6). If the current rate remains stable, 
an estimated 43,000 U.S. residents aged ≥65 years will die 
because of a fall in 2030, and if the rate continues to increase, 
59,000 fall-related deaths could result.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, changes in coding of cause of death might have 
occurred during the study period, which might contribute 
to the increased rate of deaths from falls. Second, informa-
tion about race and Hispanic ethnicity is generally reported 
by the funeral director and might be based on observation, 
which could lead to an underestimation of deaths among 
Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/
Alaska Natives.¶¶ Third, the age-adjusted rates were based 
on information from the U.S. Census, which reports as a 
limitation that it might undercount persons aged ≥65 years; 
this could result in an overestimation of death rates. Fourth, 
misclassifications of deaths might have produced overestimates 
or underestimates of deaths from falls. Finally, standard age-
adjusted populations might not fully adjust populations at 
older age groups (e.g., ≥85 years) and could explain differences 
between subgroups and states.
As the population of persons aged ≥65 years in the United 
States, increases, the rising number of deaths from falls in this 
age group can be addressed by screening for fall risk and inter-
vening to address modifiable risk factors such as polypharmacy 
or gait, strength, and balance issues. Interventions that target 
multiple risk factors can reduce the rate of falls (10) and can 
be initiated during annual wellness visits.*** Initiatives such 
as CDC’s STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and 
Injuries),††† can assist health care providers in assessing fall 
risk, educating patients, and selecting interventions.
