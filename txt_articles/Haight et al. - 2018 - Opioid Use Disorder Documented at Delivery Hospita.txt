Opioid use by pregnant women represents a significant pub-
lic health concern given the association of opioid exposure and 
adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including preterm 
labor, stillbirth, neonatal abstinence syndrome, and maternal 
mortality (1,2). State-level actions are critical to curbing the 
opioid epidemic through programs and policies to reduce use 
of prescription opioids and illegal opioids including heroin 
and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, both of which contribute 
to the epidemic (3). Hospital discharge data from the 1999–
2014 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) were 
analyzed to describe U.S. national and state-specific trends in 
opioid use disorder documented at delivery hospitalization. 
Nationally, the prevalence of opioid use disorder more than 
quadrupled during 1999–2014 (from 1.5 per 1,000 delivery 
hospitalizations to 6.5; p<0.05). Increasing trends over time 
were observed in all 28 states with available data (p<0.05). In 
2014, prevalence ranged from 0.7 in the District of Columbia 
(DC) to 48.6 in Vermont. Continued national, state, and pro-
vider efforts to prevent, monitor, and treat opioid use disorder 
among reproductive-aged and pregnant women are needed. 
Efforts might include improved access to data in Prescription 
Drug Monitoring Programs, increased substance abuse screen-
ing, use of medication-assisted therapy, and substance abuse 
treatment referrals.
Data were analyzed from the National Inpatient Sample 
(NIS; 1999–2014) and the State Inpatient Databases (SID; 
1999–2014) of HCUP
, Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality (4). NIS approximates a 20% stratified sample of all 
U.S. community hospital discharges participating in HCUP 
and is weighted to be nationally representative. Survey-specific 
analysis techniques were used to account for clustering, strati-
fication, and weighting in NIS analyses (4). The SID contain 
state-specific data on hospital inpatient stays, regardless of 
payer; 30 states and DC had publically available data (Table). 
The annual number of in-hospital delivery discharges were 
identified from the 1999–2014 NIS and SID files using 
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic and procedure codes 
pertaining to obstetric delivery (2). Cases of opioid use disorder 
were identified from diagnoses of opioid dependence (ICD-
9-CM 304.00–304.03, 304.70–304.73) and nondependent 
opioid abuse (ICD-9-CM 305.50–305.53), aligning with 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 criteria.* Annual prevalence 
of opioid use disorder per 1,000 delivery hospitalizations dur-
ing 1999–2014 was calculated nationally using NIS. Opioid

use disorder prevalence was calculated using the SID for all 
30 states and DC. For the 28 states with at least 3 consecutive 
years of data,† linear trends were assessed using logistic regres-
sion. For states with significant trends (p-values <0.05), average 
annual rate changes were estimated from the beta coefficient for 
year and the national or state-specific intercept. A sensitivity 
analysis was performed to assess whether results differed in a 
resident-only sample.
During 1999–2014, the national prevalence of opioid use 
disorder increased 333%, from 1.5 cases per 1,000 delivery 
hospitalizations to 6.5 (Figure 1), an average annual increase 
of 0.4 per 1,000 delivery hospitalizations per year (p<0.05). 
State data were available for 30 states and DC; however, avail-
ability by year ranged from 14 states in 1999 to 28 states in 
2011 (Table). In 1999, the prevalence of opioid use disorder 
ranged from 0.1 per 1,000 delivery hospitalizations in Iowa 
to 8.2 in Maryland, and in 2014, prevalence ranged from 
0.7 in DC to 48.6 in Vermont; prevalence exceeded 30 per 
1,000 delivery hospitalizations in Vermont and West Virginia 
(Figure 2). During 1999–2014, all 28 states experienced sig-
nificant increasing linear trends (p<0.05) (Table). Over the 
study period, the average annual rate increase was lowest in 
California (0.01 per 1,000 delivery hospitalizations per year), 
† Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, 
Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, 
New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, 
South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, 
and Wisconsin.
whereas the highest average annual rate increases occurred in 
Maine, New Mexico, Vermont, and West Virginia, ranging 
from 2.5 to 5.4 opioid use disorder diagnoses per 1,000 deliv-
ery hospitalizations per year. The sensitivity analysis revealed 
no large differences between state residents and nonresidents.
Discussion
Nationally, rates of opioid use disorder at delivery hospi-
talization more than quadrupled during 1999–2014. These 
findings are consistent with previously documented national 
trends in opioid use disorder at delivery hospitalization during 
1998–2011 (2) and increased national incidence of neonatal 
abstinence syndrome during 1999–2013 (1). Among 25 states 
and DC with 2014 data, the prevalence in Vermont and West 
Virginia was >3%. Although no previous multistate analyses 
of opioid use disorder at delivery hospitalization exist, these 
trends are mostly consistent with state neonatal abstinence 
syndrome estimates during 1999–2013 (5). Increasing trends 
might represent actual increases in prevalence or improved 
screening and diagnosis (6). Diagnostic procedures differ by 
state, and states with enhanced procedures for identifying 
infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome might ascertain 
more cases of maternal opioid use disorder.
These estimates also correlate with state opioid prescribing 
rates in the general population. West Virginia, for example, 
had a prescribing rate estimated at 138 opioid prescriptions 
per 100 persons in 2012, suggesting that individual persons 
might receive more than one opioid prescription per year (7).

 ¶ Estimated average annual change in the prevalence rate of opioid use disorder diagnoses per 1,000 delivery hospitalizations; all estimates were significant (p<0.05).
 ** Insufficient data (<3 years) to assess linear trend.  
Excessive prescribing and challenges in accessing nonopioid 
treatments to control pain contribute to the rise in opioid 
use disorder. In an attempt to address prescribing rates, CDC 
supports maximizing and enhancing Prescription Drug 
Monitoring Programs, state-based databases that collect, moni-
tor, and analyze controlled substance dispensing to detect risky 
prescribing practices and patient behaviors, such as multiple 
sources of prescriptions (7).
The 2016 CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic 
Pain recommends that providers take an active role in combat-
ting the opioid epidemic by considering opioid therapy for 
chronic pain only if expected benefits for pain and function 
are anticipated to outweigh risks (8). CDC and the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guide-
lines recommend that before prescribing opioids for chronic 
pain, clinicians should ensure they are appropriate, review the 
Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, provide contraception 
counseling, and discuss risks of opioid use in pregnancy (8,9). 
ACOG recommends universal substance use screening at the 
first prenatal visit to manage opioid use disorder (9). If a patient 
has opioid use disorder, clinicians should prescribe medication-
assisted therapy when possible and appropriate (8,9). Pregnant

women with opioid use disorder involving heroin might require 
referral to harm reduction services (e.g., comprehensive syringe 
services). Arranging for pregnant patients with opioid use 
disorder to deliver at facilities prepared to monitor and care 
for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome can facilitate 
access to appropriate care (8,9). After delivery, women might 
need referrals to postpartum psychosocial support services, 
substance-use treatment, and relapse-prevention programs (8).
Differing state policies might contribute to the state-to-state 
variability in opioid use disorder diagnosis. As of July 2018, 
eight states require health care professionals to test for prenatal 
drug exposure if it is suspected, and 24 states and DC require 
the reporting of suspected use (10). In addition, 23 states and 
DC consider substance use during pregnancy to be child abuse 
under child-welfare statutes, and three consider it grounds for 
civil commitment, which might result in women concealing 
substance use from their providers (10). However, data on the 
impact of these policies are scarce.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, not all states provide data to the public-use SID 
database. Within the data provided, not all hospitals par-
ticipated; however, at least 80% of births reported to CDC’s 
National Center for Health Statistics are represented for each 
state.§ For the NIS, 2014 data were sampled from 45 states

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
National rates of opioid use disorder are increasing among 
reproductive-aged and pregnant women, and opioid use 
during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and 
neonatal outcomes.
What is added by this report?
National opioid use disorder rates at delivery more than 
quadrupled during 1999–2014. Rates significantly increased in 
all 28 states with 3 years of data. Rate increases in Maine, New 
Mexico, Vermont, and West Virginia exceeded 2.5 per 1,000 
deliveries per year. In 2014, rates ranged from 0.7 (District of 
Columbia) to 48.6 (Vermont).
What are the implications for public health practice?
National, state, and provider efforts are needed to prevent, 
monitor, and treat opioid use disorder among reproductive-
aged and pregnant women.
that include 94% of U.S. community hospital discharges. 
Second, analysis includes all hospital deliveries, regardless 
of the mother’s state of residency. Thus, results can only be 
interpreted for delivery hospitalizations in each state, which 
might not reflect trends among residents, although the sensi-
tivity analysis revealed no large differences in rates by resident 
status. Third, results might not be generalizable to births that 
occurred outside of a hospital; these represent only 1.5% of all 
births.¶ Fourth, opioid use disorder might be underreported 
in this analysis; documentation of opioid use disorder at 
delivery hospitalization might not reflect diagnoses at other 
points in the pregnancy. Although universal verbal screening 
for substance use is recommended by ACOG (9), it is often 
not standard practice, which can lead to underestimates. Fifth, 
these data are ICD-code–dependent, limiting the ability to 
differentiate the source of opioid use disorder. The accuracy of 
codes might vary by hospital and state, leading to misreporting 
of opioid use disorder.
This first multistate analysis of opioid use disorder among 
delivery hospitalizations can be used by states to monitor the 
prevalence of opioid use disorder at delivery hospitalizations. 
There is continued need for national, state, and provider efforts 
to prevent, monitor, and treat opioid use disorder among 
reproductive-aged and pregnant women.
