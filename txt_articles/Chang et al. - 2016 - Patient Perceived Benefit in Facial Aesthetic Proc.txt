Abstract
Background: There are numerous methods of assessing patient satisfaction with botulinum toxin type A neuromodulation of the glabellar rhytids. As
the use of aesthetic neuromodulation increases both in breadth and number of procedures, there is a need for more comprehensive tools to evaluate
patient-reported outcomes. The FACE-Q is a recently validated patient-reported outcome instrument that can be used to measure patient perceptions of
botulinum toxin type A neuromodulation.
Objectives: This study used the FACE-Q to assess patient satisfaction following botulinum toxin type A neuromodulation of the glabellar rhytids.
Methods: 57 female patients completed the FACE-Q, a survey that evaluates patients’ satisfaction with their facial appearance. After this baseline survey,
the patients received injections of one of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Allergan, Dublin, Ireland), abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport, Galderma, Lausanne,
Switzerland), or incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin, Merz Pharmaceuticals, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) in the glabella. Two weeks post-injection, the patients
completed the FACE-Q again. The percentage changes in patient responses were tabulated to determine how neuromodulation affects patient satisfaction
with their facial appearance. The percentage changes for each of the neurotoxin groups were compared to determine if patient satisfaction with neuromo-
dulation varies with the type of neurotoxin.
Results: Patient satisfaction with their overall facial appearance increased by 28% following neuromodulation. Patients stated that they believe they look
an average of 5.6 years younger post-neuromodulation. There were no significant differences among the treatment groups.
Conclusions: The FACE-Q demonstrates that patients are more satisfied by their overall facial appearance and age appearance following neuromodula-
tion of their glabellar rhytids. Patients are equally satisfied with the improvement of their facial appearance regardless of which neurotoxin they received.

Neuromodulation with botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) is
the most common cosmetic procedure performed in the
United States, with 3.6 million procedures performed in
2014.1 While FDA approval for aesthetic BoNT-A injections
is limited to the treatment of glabellar and lateral canthal
lines, the aesthetic use of BoNT-A injections has markedly
expanded to frequently include treatment of the frontalis,
nasalis, and musculature of the lower face and neck.2,3 The
expanded use of BoNT-A, both in terms of numbers and in-
dications, prompts the need for a useful and reliable means
of assessing patient satisfaction following aesthetic BoNT-A
neuromodulation for the optimization of patient outcomes.
Prior studies indicate patients are highly satisfied with their
results following BoNT-A treatment.4 However, methods of
evaluating patient satisfaction for such studies are varied, both
with respect to the aspects of facial aesthetics being assessed

 as well as the type of scales used to make the assessments.4
Several of these studies of BoNT-A neuromodulation of glabellar
rhytids asked patients a single question about their overall satis-
faction with their facial appearance pre- and post-neurotoxin in-
jection and used a three-, four-, five-, or seven-point range of
satisfaction levels.5-12 More comprehensive surveys such as the
Facial Line Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, Facial Line
Outcomes Questionnaire, Self-Perception of Age, and Freiburg
Questionnaire on Aesthetic Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery,
have also been used to demonstrate the positive patient-
perceived effects of BoNT-A neuromodulation.13-18 These
questionnaires asked patients about multiple facets of facial
appearance satisfaction including youthfulness, attractiveness,
confidence, and their psychosocial well-being as a result of
their facial appearance.
As the number of neurotoxins and their aesthetic uses in-
crease, additional studies must be conducted to evaluate the
efficacy, safety, and administration of BoNT-A neuromodula-
tion. An important component of such analyses is the identi-
fication of the most useful and reliable methods of assessing
patient satisfaction with BoNT-A injection outcomes. The
FACE-Q is a newly developed and validated patient-reported
outcome instrument that can be used for measuring patient
perceptions of cosmetic facial procedures.19-21 The develop-
ers of the FACE-Q describe the questionnaire as a “short,
easy to complete, reliable, valid and responsive” patient-
reported outcome tool for any type of surgical or non-surgical
facial aesthetic procedure.20 Two important advantages of
the FACE-Q instrument are that it is well calibrated to
measure pre- to post-procedure change and that it performs
equivalently regardless of patient age, gender, and ethnici-
ty.20 The developers of the FACE-Q identified four domains
of patient satisfaction: appearance appraisal, adverse effects,
process of care, and quality of life. Each of these domains has
a series of individual surveys to assess, for example, appear-
ance appraisal of skin or process of care of information.
Physicians trying to assess the patient-perceived efficacy of
an aesthetic intervention can handpick the qualities for their
analysis metrics. The ability to tailor the FACE-Q’s content to
specific aspects of facial anatomy, as well as to specific quali-
ties of patient satisfaction, makes the FACE-Q instrument in-
credibly important to evidence-based medicine studies of
aesthetic facial interventions, as the similarly designed and
well documented BREAST-Q instrument has been to breast
intervention studies.22-24 Several of the FACE-Q instruments
have already been used successfully to assess patient satisfac-
tion with rhinoplasties and facelifts.25,26
This study is the first to use the FACE-Q to assess
patient-perceived satisfaction with BoNT-A neuromodula-
tion. The goal of this study is to use the FACE-Q to better
understand patient-perceived satisfaction with BoNT-A
neuromodulation and to determine specific factors underly-
ing patient satisfaction. In particular, this study examines
the effect of patient-specific characteristics, including age,
Fitzpatrick skin type, and Glogau wrinkling on patient satisfac-
tion. Further, this study intends to examine whether the degree
of satisfaction or dissatisfaction is dependent on the type of neu-
rotoxin administered: onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Allergan,
Dublin, Ireland), abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport, Galderma,
Lausanne, Switzerland), or incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin,
Merz Pharmaceuticals, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Finally,
this study quantifies the relationship between patients’ self-
reported satisfaction with BoNT-A neuromodulation and their
objective, quantitative facial strain reduction. This study intro-
duces the FACE-Q as a new, effective, alternative instrument to
analyze patient-reported outcomes following aesthetic BoNT-A
neuromodulation of the glabellar rhytids.
METHODS
Seventy-five female patients between the ages of 18 and 75
were
prospectively
recruited
at
the
Hospital
of
the
University of Pennsylvania, Department of Plastic Surgery
following
Institutional
Review
Board
(IRB)
approval
(Protocol #819609) and informed consent. This IRB addi-
tionally covered a concurrent study that investigated the
use of digital image correlation to objectively quantify gla-
bellar strain.27 Female patients of any Fitzpatrick skin type,
Glogau score, or degree of rhytid etching who have never
been treated with a neurotoxin were eligible for this study.
The exclusion criteria included patients who have previously
been treated with a neurotoxin, are older than 75 years of
age, are pregnant, have had a prior condition or surgery
that affects facial animation, have a known contraindica-
tion to neurotoxins, or have an open wound. To adhere to
the manufacturer-recommended dose for glabellar treat-
ment and to minimize neurotoxin efficacy variability sec-
ondary to increased muscle mass in males, male patients
were excluded from this study.28,29 Treatment randomiza-
tion was performed in the following manner: (1) each neu-
rotoxin, onabotulinumtoxinA, abobotulinumtoxinA, and
incobotulinumtoxinA, was randomly assigned a letter des-
ignation, A, B, or C; 2) a Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA)
spreadsheet was generated with assigned letters in repeat-
ing order (A, B, C, A, B, C, etc.); and 3) patients were as-
signed the letter corresponding to the specific neurotoxin in
the order in which they enrolled in the study. The nurse
who prepared the syringes was the only personnel to know
which letter corresponded to which neurotoxin, and she
provided the injector with the correct syringe when the
patient told her which letter they were assigned. Therefore,
the patients, injector, and evaluators were blinded to which
neurotoxin a given patient received.
Because all three of these neurotoxins are used com-
monly in clinical practice, this study sought to investigate
patient-reported satisfaction with all formulations used
in the United States. This study therefore was powered
to have enough patients to determine an overall pre- to

 post-treatment effect, but was not specifically designed to
evaluate the different toxins secondary to limited funding
resources. The comparative analysis was performed to
determine whether, even with the relatively small sample
size, there were patient-reported differences in response to
the different neurotoxin treatments.
Patients underwent baseline imaging of the glabella using
digital image correlation (DIC) to objectively quantify glabel-
lar strain as described in prior work.30,31 Following baseline
imaging, patients answered the FACE-Q, a 63-question
survey that asks patients to evaluate their satisfaction with
their overall appearance, age appearance, and the appear-
ance of cheeks, nasolabial folds, lower face and jawline,
chin, and neck. Afterwards, patients had their Fitzpatrick
skin type and Glogau score evaluated by a single trained
investigator. Patients were then treated. All of the neurotox-
ins were consistently diluted, and all dilutions were per-
formed on the day of injection. One hundred units of
onabotulinumtoxinA were diluted in 2.5 cc of preservative-
free saline. Three hundred units of abobotulinumtoxinA
were diluted in 2.5 cc of preservative-free saline. One
hundred units of incobotulinumtoxinA were diluted in 2.5 cc
of preservative-free saline and inverted, per manufacturer
instructions. Individual syringes with either 20 units of
onabotulinumtoxinA, 60 units of abobotulinumtoxinA, or 20
units of incobotulinumtoxinA were prepared and a single
trained injector injected each patient with a single syringe in
five distinct and consistent injection locations (Figure 1).
Patients were instructed to return 4 days post-injection for
re-imaging, 14 days post-injection for re-imaging and for
re-evaluation by the FACE-Q, and 90 days post-injection for
re-imaging. The 75 patients were divided into three groups,
each coming in on a different set of dates to facilitate the in-
jections and imaging. The first group of patients began
imaging in June 2014, and the third group of patients com-
pleted imaging in December 2014. The imaging data from
these patients are described in a separate study.27
The answers to the FACE-Q were compiled by research
electronic data capture and exported to Microsoft Excel and
JMP (Cary, NC) for statistical analysis. For each of the
FACE-Q sections, the responses to the questions in that
section can be summed and converted to a Rasch trans-
formed score, which ranges from 0 (lowest satisfaction) to
100 (highest satisfaction). This single metric serves as a
proxy for the patient’s overall satisfaction with the appear-
ance of that aspect of his or her face. The average percent-
age change in response was calculated for each of the
questions and for all of the Rasch scores. The t test was
used to determine if the patients’ satisfaction with their
facial appearance statistically significantly changed from
baseline to 14 days post-injection. ANOVA, followed by
multiple comparisons tests, was used to determine if the
percentage changes in FACE-Q responses depended on the
neurotoxin treatment type or patient characteristics includ-
ing age, Fitzpatrick score, and Glogau score. For these anal-
yses, the patients were categorized into three age groups:
young (under 40), middle-aged (40 to 60), and old (over
60). In addition, the patients were categorized into two
Fitzpatrick groups: light-skinned (I to III) and dark-skinned
(IV to VI). Finally, the patients were categorized into two
Glogau groups: mild wrinkling (I and II) and severe wrin-
kling (III and IV). Linear regression analysis was used to
calculate the correlation between patients’ subjective im-
provement in their facial appearance and their objective,
quantitative glabellar strain reduction as measured by DIC.
For all tests, a P-value of < .05 was considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Seventy-five female patients were initially recruited for this
study, with 25 patients randomized to each of the three
neurotoxin groups. A total of 57 patients completed the
FACE-Q both on the injection date and the 14-day follow-up
date and were eligible for this analysis. Two patients were
removed from the study, one for a history of myasthenia
gravis and one for an open wound on the face. Five patients
did not return on day 14. Eleven patients did not complete
the survey on both of their visits. The average age of the 57
patients with pre- and post-neurotoxin FACE-Q responses
was 49.6 years (range, 32-75 years). These patients were
evenly distributed among the neurotoxin treatments, pri-
marily had Fitzpatrick skin types of II-IV, and had moderate
Figure 1. Each patient underwent standardized injection of
the corrugator and procerus muscles in the five marked injec-
tion points by a single trained injector. Each patient was inject-
ed with a randomly-assigned neurotoxin that was prepared
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. There was no
variation of dose or injection location among the patients. The
subject in this photo is a 33-year-old female staff member who
was used as an example to depict the injection points; she was
not a patient in the study and received no course of treatment.

 Glogau wrinkle scores of II-III (Table 1). There were two pa-
tients for whom the Fitzpatrick and Glogau scores were not
recorded. When comparing the neurotoxin groups, there
were no significant differences in age (P = .64), Fitzpatrick
skin type (P = .18), or Glogau wrinkling (P = .29) (Table 2).
While all 57 patients were presented with the FACE-Q in
its entirety, not all patients answered every question on
both survey dates. Of the 63 questions, an average of 62.5
were answered in the pre-treatment survey, and an average
of 62.2 were answered in the post-treatment survey.
Forty-six percent of patients answered the survey in its en-
tirety on both dates. Combining both surveys, 28% missed
one question, 11% missed two, 5% missed three, and 11%
missed more than three questions.
The first component of the FACE-Q assesses the
patients’ satisfaction with their overall facial appearance.
Post-neuromodulation, patients reported a 38% increase in
symmetry (P < .01), 12% increase in balance (P < .01),
31% increase in appearance at the end of the day (P < .01),
36% increase in freshness (P < .01), 47% increase in rest-
fulness (P < .01), 24% increase in appearance of profile
(P < .01), 29% increase in appearance in photos (P < .01),
23% increase in appearance when waking up (P < .01),
and 23% increase in appearance under bright lights
(P < .01) (Table 3). The post-neuromodulation Rasch score
was 28% greater than the pre-neuromodulation Rasch
score (P < .01) (Table 3). This indicates that patients’ satis-
faction with their overall facial appearance was statistically
significantly greater after neuromodulation. However, there
was considerable variation in how patients’ satisfaction
with their facial appearance changed after neurotoxin treat-
ment, as 19% of patients were actually less satisfied with
their facial appearance following their botulinum toxin in-
jection (Figure 2). Patients receiving incobotulinumtoxinA
had a 36% increase in satisfaction with overall facial
appearance, compared to 29% for onabotulinumtoxinA
patients
and
18%
for
abobotulinumtoxinA
patients;
however, these differences were not statistically significant
(P = .33) (Table 4). The change in patients’ satisfaction
with their facial appearance overall did not correlate with
their age (P = .58), Fitzpatrick score (P = .87), or Glogau
score (P = .77) (Table 5).
The second component of the FACE-Q assessed the pa-
tients’ age appearance. After neurotoxin treatment, patients

 less-strongly believed that they don’t recognize themselves
(P < .01)
and
that
they
don’t
look
like
themselves
(P = .01) because of how old they look (Table 6). There
were no significant differences in responses to the other
questions regarding patients’ perceptions of their age
(Table 6). However, the Rasch score was 30% greater fol-
lowing neuromodulation (P < .01), indicating that patients
overall were more satisfied with how old they appear fol-
lowing BoNT-A neuromodulation (Table 6). Although pa-
tients overall were more satisfied with their age appearance
post-injection, 23% of patients had decreased satisfaction
with their age appearance (Figure 3). Patients receiving
abobotulinumtoxinA had a 35% increase in satisfaction with
age appearance, compared to 34% for incobotulinumtoxinA
patients and 19% onabotulinumtoxinA patients; however,
these differences were not significant (P = .79) (Table 7).
Patients over 60 had a 46% increase in age appearance, com-
pared to 19% for patients under 40, and 27% for patients
between 40 and 60; though again, these differences were not
significant (P = .62) due to the variability and relatively
small sample size (Table 8). The change in patients’ satis-
faction with their age appearance did not correlate with
their Fitzpatrick score (P = .60) or Glogau score (P = .64)
(Table 8). A separate but related question asked patients how
old they think they look relative to their actual age. Prior to
injection, patients, on average, stated that they look 6.4 years
older than their actual age. After injection, patients, on
average, stated that they look only 0.8 years older than their
actual age. This decrease of 5.6 years was statistically signifi-
cant (P < .01), indicating that patients felt that they look
younger following neuromodulation (Table 6). This finding
was not correlated with neurotoxin (P = .26), age (P = .39),
Fitzpatrick score (P = .61), or Glogau score (P = .73).
The third component of the FACE-Q assessed patients’ sat-
isfaction with specific regions of the face. Patient satisfaction
with the appearance of their cheeks increased in almost all of
the evaluated characteristics: 15% increase in smoothness
(P < .01), 19% increase in attractiveness (P < .01), 19% in-
crease in contour (P < .01), and 20% increase in youthful
fullness (P < .01) (Table 9). The Rasch score was 25%
greater post-neuromodulation (P < .01), indicating that pa-
tients overall were more satisfied with the appearance of
their cheeks post-injection (Table 9). Patients receiving
abobotulinumtoxinA had a greater increase in satisfaction,
44%, than patients receiving onabotulinumtoxinA, 11%

 (P = .04) (Table 10). There were no significant differences
between
onabotulinumtoxinA
and
incobotulinumtoxinA
(P = .51) or between abobotulinumtoxinA and incobotulin-
umtoxinA (P = .14) (Table 10). The change in patients’ satis-
faction with their facial appearance overall did not correlate
with their age (P = .38), Fitzpatrick score (P = .36), or
Glogau score (P = .19) (Table 11). Furthermore, there were
no significant changes, relative to baseline, in patient satis-
faction with their nasolabial folds (P = .10), lower face and
jawline (P = .46), chin (P = .13), and neck (P = .17) follow-
ing neuromodulation (Tables 12-15). The FACE-Q scales re-
lating to the upper face were not validated at the time of the
study and thus could not be applied.
The fourth component of the FACE-Q assessed negative
sequelae of the face. The sole negative sequelae that bothered
patients post-treatment compared with pre-treatment was dif-
ficulty with facial expressions (P = .05) (Table 16).
Finally, there was an inverse relationship between the
Rasch score in overall facial appearance and average glabellar
strain, representing increased patient satisfaction with lower
glabellar strain. However, this finding was not significant
either pre-neurotoxin treatment (P = .43) or post-neurotoxin
treatment (P = .15). Importantly, there did not appear to be
a correlation between the change in patient satisfaction and
the amount of glabellar strain reduction (P = .83).
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that the FACE-Q is a reliable,
valid, and effective instrument to assess the patient-
reported outcomes of BoNT-A neuromodulation. As aes-
thetic
neurotoxin
injection
applications
continue
to
expand, the FACE-Q should be utilized as a measurement
tool for assessing the efficacy of aesthetic BoNT-A neuro-
modulation on patient satisfaction. What differentiates the
FACE-Q from other patient-reported outcome instruments
is its comprehensiveness. Like other questionnaires, the
FACE-Q can capture changes in patients’ satisfaction with
their overall facial appearance due to aesthetic intervention.
Unlike other questionnaires, the FACE-Q can assess satis-
faction with specific facial regions and, further, can assess
patients’ perceptions of their age appearance. This breadth
eliminates the need for combining multiple surveys, such

 as the Facial Lines Outcomes and Self-Perception of Age
questionnaires.17
The finding that patient satisfaction with the overall ap-
pearance of their face increased by 28% after BoNT-A neuro-
modulation is consistent with other studies that have found a
positive patient-perceived effect of BoNT-A neuromodulation
on their facial appearance.4 Unlike previous studies, this is
the first to examine whether patient satisfaction differs
among
onabotulinumtoxinA,
abobotulinumtoxinA,
and
incobotulinumtoxinA formulations. Patients treated with
incobotulinumtoxinA had the greatest percentage change
in the Rasch transformed score for “Satisfaction with Facial
Appearance
Overall”
at
36%.
Patients
treated
with
onabotulinumtoxinA had a 29% change, and patients treated
with abobotulinumtoxinA had an 18% change. However,
due to the variability in patient satisfaction, these differences
were not statistically significant (P = .33). Nevertheless, this
finding is particularly interesting in light of prior research
comparing these three neurotoxins. One study reported that
incobotulinumtoxinA has a more rapid onset and a longer
duration
of
treatment
than
onabotulinumtoxinA
and
abobotulinumtoxinA, when using the Merz 5-point scale for
glabellar frown lines.32 In contrast, the data from the toxin
comparison study of the same patients in this study using the
DIC technology suggest that onabotulinumtoxinA has a
greater quantitative effect on glabellar strain reduction than
incobotulinumtoxinA.27 Additional research is required to
evaluate potential differences in patient satisfaction among
neurotoxins in relation to quantitative strain reduction, as
well as the optimal assessment tool for strain reduction.
However, it remains clear that patient satisfaction with their
overall facial appearance improves following all formulations
of BoNT-A neuromodulation.
A distinct benefit of BoNT-A neuromodulation that is
uniquely captured by the FACE-Q instrument is that patients
are more satisfied with how old they look following neuro-
toxin injection. The patients in this study believe their aging
appearance is on average 30% better and that they look
younger 5.6 years younger following any BoNT-A formula-
tion injection. This is consistent with a prior study that used
the Self-Perception of Age questionnaire and found that pa-
tients felt that they looked 3.9 years younger following
BoNT-A injection than at baseline.17 Furthermore, that same
study found that patients who felt that they looked older

 than their actual age at baseline reported that they looked
10.4 years younger relative to baseline following neurotoxin
treatment.17 Similarly, the patients in our study who felt they
looked older than their actual age at baseline reported that
they looked 7.9 years younger relative to baseline following
treatment, suggesting that improvement in age appearance
following BoNT-A treatment may be more effective for pa-
tients who believe they look older than their chronological
age. Furthermore, while not statistically significant, older pa-
tients appeared to be more satisfied with their appearance

 post-BoNT-A neuromodulation. Patients over 60 years old re-
ported a 33% increase in satisfaction with their overall facial
appearance and a 46% increase in satisfaction with their age
appearance, in contrast to 19% and 19%, respectively, for
patients under 40 years of age. Therefore, patient age is
likely a significant contributor to the variation in patient re-
ported satisfaction with BoNT-A neuromodulation, with
older patients, not unexpectedly, benefitting more from such
treatments than younger ones. This congruency with the
Self-Perception of Age indicates that the FACE-Q does effec-
tively capture the changes in age appearance following neu-
romodulation.
While it is clear that patients in general are satisfied with
their BoNT-A treatment, the FACE-Q data demonstrate that
there is a subset of patients who do not appreciate a
benefit, with 19% of patients reporting a decrease in satis-
faction with their overall facial appearance, and 23% of pa-
tients feeling that they looked older following BoNT-A
treatment. Interestingly, many of the patients who did not
report a positive effect of BoNT-A via the FACE-Q demon-
strated large quantitative reductions in glabellar strain via
DIC measurements, as described in this study’s parallel
study.27 These observations are consistent with the clinical
experience of neuromodulation that suggests not all pa-
tients are comfortable with or accepting of a change in their
appearance following this treatment. This suggests that the
overall efficacy of a toxin on quantitative strain reduction
may not directly correlate with patient satisfaction and
perhaps reflects the anecdotal clinical experience with pa-
tients wishing to avoid the “frozen look.” Alternative expla-
nations are that some patients may have unrealistic
expectations, may require treatment of additional anatomic
regions for an attractive synergistic effect, or may require
specifically tailored treatments of the glabella that were not
possible while keeping within the protocol of this study.
Nevertheless, these observations require further explora-
tion with additional studies to optimize patient outcomes.
Of additional interest is that BoNT-A neuromodulation
can increase patient satisfaction in facial regions not
directly treated, as demonstrated by patients who were
25% more satisfied with the appearance of their cheeks
post-BoNT-A neuromodulation. Because it has been report-
ed previously that BoNT-A injections can positively affect
patients’ emotional and psychosocial wellbeing, one possi-
ble explanation of this finding is that patients’ satisfaction
with respect to how their face looks overall may bias their
perceptions of cheek appearance as well.33-35 In contrast,
patients’ satisfaction with the other regions of their face did
not improve following BoNT-A neuromodulation, suggest-
ing that the cheek finding may indeed be anatomically

 related to the improvement of glabellar animation and
upper face dynamics.
Finally, there was an inverse relationship between patient
satisfaction with facial appearance and their degree of glabel-
lar strain. This inverse relationship was stronger at the
14-day follow-up, with a linear regression slope of −0.77
(1% increase in glabellar strain is associated with a 0.77%
decrease in satisfaction with facial appearance) than at base-
line, with linear regression slope of −0.35. However, this cor-
relation was not statistically significant. Surprisingly, the
degree of glabellar strain reduction did not correlate with the
change in patient satisfaction with overall facial appearance,
a finding that is not entirely surprising, and that suggests
that patients with a more moderate effect post BoNT-A neu-
romodulation may be more satisfied, perhaps secondary to a
more “natural” correction.
While the use of FACE-Q to assess patient-reported out-
comes of aesthetic procedures has its merits, there are
some limitations of the survey and this study. The survey
that was administered to the patients included only the sec-
tions that were currently validated and available for re-
search use at the time of the study and therefore did not
contain the section that specifically assessed patient satis-
faction with the forehead. Though at the time that the
study was conducted, the FACE-Q scales for the upper face
were not validated or available for research purposes,
we hypothesized that the effect of glabellar neuromodula-
tion on patient-perceived benefits is likely not limited to the
glabellar region alone and thus could initially be examined
using available FACE-Q scales. Our data confirm the benefi-
cial effects of glabellar neuromodulation on other areas of
the face. Future studies incorporating the now-validated
upper face scales will be conducted and this limitation does
not negate the clear and robust findings of improved overall
satisfaction and age appearance following BoNT-A neuro-
modulation. Another shortcoming is that less than half the
patients completed the entire survey on both dates. One
possible explanation is that a given patient omitted a ques-
tion because of the length of the survey or because the ques-
tion was not deemed relevant by the patient. This limitation
can be resolved in the future by having the survey program
allow the patient to move on to the next section only after all
the questions in the previous section have been answered.
An alternative explanation is that some patients became fa-
tigued by the length of the survey and elected to avoid ques-
tions that they did not wish to answer. This suggests that the
FACE-Q’s strength, its comprehensiveness, may also be a po-
tential downfall. Physicians must carefully consider potential
survey fatigue and how a long survey can adversely affect a
patient’s opinion in answering the questions regarding their
satisfaction. Therefore, careful selection of the most impor-
tant and relevant sections in tailoring the FACE-Q survey in-
strument for a specific study is important to maintain a high
response rate for evidence-based aesthetic medicine.
CONCLUSION
The FACE-Q is an effective patient-reported outcome instru-
ment that confirms the literature regarding overall satisfaction
and improvement in age appearance following BoNT-A neu-
romodulation. The FACE-Q survey used in this study is the
first to demonstrate that patient satisfaction following neuro-
modulation of the glabella is not statistically significantly dif-
ferent between onabotulinumtoxinA, abobotulinumtoxinA,
and incobotulinumtoxinA formulations. Patient satisfaction
with BoNT-A neuromodulation does not correlate with
patient age, skin color, or degree of skin wrinkling, though
there is an inverse trend for patient satisfaction, advancing
age, and degree of glabellar strain. The inverse correlation
between the FACE-Q-determined patient satisfaction and the
DIC-determined glabellar strain indicates that patients are
overall more satisfied with lower glabellar strain, but not nec-
essarily a large change in their strain profile. Overall, this
study demonstrates that the FACE-Q instrument should be
utilized as a comprehensive tool for assessing patient out-
comes following aesthetic BoNT-A neuromodulation.
