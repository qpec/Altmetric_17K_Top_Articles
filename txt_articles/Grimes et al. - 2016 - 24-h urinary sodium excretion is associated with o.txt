Abstract
Emerging evidence indicates that dietary Na may be linked to obesity; however it is unclear whether this relationship is independent of energy
intake (EI). The aim of this study was to assess the association between Na intake and measures of adiposity, including BMI z score, weight
category and waist:height ratio (WHtR), in a sample of Australian schoolchildren. This was a cross-sectional study of schoolchildren aged
4–12 years. Na intake was assessed via one 24-h urine collection. BMI was converted to age- and sex-specific z scores, and WHtR was used to
define abdominal obesity. In children aged ≥8 years, EI was determined via one 24-h dietary recall. Of the 666 children with valid urine
samples 55 % were male (average age 9·3 (SD 1·8) years). In adjusted models an additional 17 mmol/d of Na was associated with a 0·10 higher
BMI z score (95 % CI 0·07, 0·13), a 23 % (OR 1·23; 95 % CI 1·16, 1·31) greater risk of being overweight/obese and a 15 % (OR 1·15; 95 % CI 1·09,
1·23) greater risk of being centrally obese. In the subsample of 8–12-year-old children (n 458), adjustment for EI did not markedly alter the
associations between Na and adiposity outcomes. Using a robust measure of daily Na intake we found a positive association between
Na intake and obesity risk in Australian schoolchildren, which could not be explained by total energy consumption. To determine whether this
is a causal relationship, longitudinal studies, with high-quality measures of Na and EI, are required.
Key words: Sodium, dietary: Sodium chloride, dietary: Obesity: Adiposity: Children: Australia
In developed countries most children consume too much Na
with intakes frequently exceeding dietary recommendations(1).
In addition to the more well-established links between Na intake
and blood pressure(2), Na has recently been associated with
obesity risk in children and adolescents(3–8). Early work in this
area focused on the indirect association of Na intake with obesity
through the greater consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages
(SSB)(3–5,9), which are a known risk factor for weight gain in
children(10). Across these population-based cross-sectional studies
Na intake was found to be positively associated with total fluid
intake as well as SSB intake in children and adolescents from the
UK(5), the USA(4) and Australia(3). Informed by experimental
evidence in animals(11) and adults(12,13), which shows the
activation of thirst and fluid intake to regulate body fluid balance
when Na intake is increased, the observed association between
Na and SSB intake in children is plausible.
However, in contrast to these findings, other studies have
reported positive associations between Na intake and measures
of adiposity independent of energy intake (EI)(6–8). In Korean
children Na density (Na intake (mg)/food intake (g) per d) was
positively associated with obesity and abdominal obesity(7), and
in US adolescents(8) Na intake was positively associated with
BMI, waist circumference and percentage of body fat (%BF),
independent of energy and SSB intake. In all of the afore-
mentioned studies Na intake was assessed using dietary recall
or food diary methods. These methods do not measure the
amount of Na from table or cooking salt and therefore tend to
underestimate total daily Na intake(14). To date, only one
paediatric study has used 24-h urinary Na excretion to assess
the relationship between total daily Na (i.e. food sources and
discretionary salt) intake and obesity risk(6). In this study of
German children 24-h urinary Na excretion was positively
associated with BMI z score and %BF. Furthermore, the
association remained after the adjustment of total EI or SSB
intake. Overall, there is a growing evidence base to indicate that
Na intake is associated with measures of adiposity in children.
However, there is limited evidence using a reliable measure of
total daily Na intake. Given the tracking phenomenon of
overweight and obesity from childhood across the lifespan(15),
understanding dietary determinants of obesity is of paramount
importance. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the
association between total daily Na intake, as assessed by 24-h
Abbreviations: %BF, percentage of body fat; EI, energy intake; SES, socio-economic status; SSB, sugar-sweetened beverages.

 urinary Na excretion, and measures of adiposity, including BMI
z score, weight category and abdominal obesity, in a sample of
Australian schoolchildren aged 4–12 years.
Methods
Data for this analysis come from the cross-sectional Salt and
Other Nutrient Intakes in Children study, and the methods(16)
have been reported previously.
Study invitations were sent to a convenience sample of 509
government and non-government schools, and fifty-six schools
(11 %) agreed to participate. Within participating schools
consent was obtained from 852 children (response rate = 6 %);
forty-one children withdrew from the study and children who
did not agree to attend an off-school campus data collection day
(n 25) or who were aged >13 years (n 6) were excluded,
leaving 780 participants. The Deakin University Research Ethics
Committee (Project No: EC 62-2009) approved the study.
Written informed consent was obtained from the primary
caregiver and the child.
Measures
Data collection occurred between June 2010 and May 2013.
Parents completed a questionnaire reporting on children’s
date of birth and sex. Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas,
Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage(17), was used to
group schools, based on school postcode, into tertiles of
socio-economic disadvantage. This marker was used to define
socio-economic status (SES), whereby the participant was
grouped as either low, mid or high SES with reference to the
tertile that the school they attended fell within.
24-h urine collection
Details of the 24-h urine collection procedures have been
previously described(16). In brief, children could opt to commence
the
24-h
urine
collection
at
the
start
of
a
school
day
(i.e. approximately 09.00 hours Monday to Friday) or at any
suitable time on a non-school day (i.e. weekends, public
holidays and school holidays). At the commencement of the
24-h urine collection, children were instructed to empty their
bladder, discard this urine and note this as the start time.
Following this, all urine voided was collected up until the
corresponding 24-h finish time. Parents and children were
provided with written instructions on how to complete the 24-h
urine collection. Parents were asked to report any missed
collections or spillages on a urine collection slip, which was
returned with the 24-h urine sample. Returned 24-h urine samples
were transported to an accredited commercial pathology laboratory
(Dorevitch
Pathology)
for
urinalysis.
Urinary
Na
and
K
concentration was assessed using indirect ion selective electrodes,
and urinary creatinine concentration was assessed using the
Jaffe reaction(18) on the Siemens Advia 2400 analyser (Siemens
Healthcare). The CV for Na and K was <1% and for creatinine it
was 3·25%. The molecular weights of Na (23g/mol) and sodium
chloride (58·5g/mol) were used to convert laboratory values in
mmol of Na to mg(19). If the duration of the collection was not
exactly 24h but within 20–28h, urinary electrolytes, creatinine and
total volume were standardised to a 24-h period (i.e. (24h/urine
duration (h))×urinary measure). Urine samples were considered
incomplete if collection time was <20 or >28h, total volume was
<300 ml, the participant reported missing >1 collection, or urinary
creatinine excretion was <0·1 mmol/kg body weight per d(16). Of
the 780 participants, 763 returned urine specimens and 667 of
these were deemed complete(16). One extreme outlier for urinary
Na excretion (mean 531 (SD 8·7) mmol) was excluded, leaving an
analytical sample of 666. There were no differences in age, sex,
SES or weight category between completers and non-completers
of the urine collection.
Anthropometric measurements
Height, weight and waist circumference were measured by
trained research staff following standard protocols(16). BMI values
were converted to age- and sex-adjusted BMI z scores using the
2000 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth
charts(20,21). Participants were grouped into weight categories
(underweight, healthy weight, overweight, obese) using the
International Obesity Taskforce BMI reference cut-offs for
children(22,23). The waist:height ratio (WHtR), which is not
dependent on age or sex references, was used as a marker of
central adiposity(24). This was calculated as waist circumference
(cm) divided by height (cm). A WHtR ≥0·5 has been associated
with cardiovascular risk factors in the paediatric population(24,25),
and this cut-off was used to define abdominal obesity(24).
Dietary intake
One face-to-face three-pass 24-h dietary recall was completed
with the child on the day of the testing procedures completed
at the school site. This method includes the following stages:
(i) provide a quick list of all foods and beverages consumed
from midnight to midnight on the day before the interview;
(ii) probe questions relevant to each quick list item to gather
more detailed information – for example, the amount consumed,
brand name, additions to the food item; and (iii) a recall review to
cross-check information. In this analysis we report intakes of
energy (MJ/d) and SSB (g/d) in the subsample of children aged
≥8 years who completed a three-pass 24-h dietary recall. Of these
498 children, six could not complete the dietary recall and were
excluded from the analysis. Children <8 years of age do not
reliably recall food(26) intakes and dietary data are not presented
for this age group (n 168). SSB included sugar-sweetened soda,
cordial, fruit drinks, flavoured mineral water, and sports and
energy drinks(3).
The paediatric adjusted Goldberg cut-off method(27) was
used to identify participants with implausible EI. This method
compares the participant’s ratio of reported EI:estimated BMR
(estBMR) with the Goldberg cut-off 2 value. Age- and sex-specific
Goldberg cut-off values were determined using the original adult
Goldberg
equation(28),
substituted
with
child-specific
light
physical activity levels (PAL)(29) and revised estimates(30) for the
CV in EI (CVwEI 23 %), repeated BMR measurements (CVwB 8·5 %)
and variation in PAL (CVtp 15 %). On this basis, participants (n 34,
6·9 %) with an EI:estBMR ratio <0·87 for 8–12-year-old boys and
0·84 for 8–12-year-old girls were classified as a low-energy
reporter and excluded from analyses with dietary data. It has been

 shown that under-reporting is more likely to occur with increased
body fatness(31). Therefore, in this analysis, which includes
adiposity as an outcome measure, we considered it important to
identify and exclude low-energy reporters. An additional sensi-
tivity analysis was performed, whereby no children were exclu-
ded on the basis of misreporting. In this analysis there was no
appreciable change to the results when identified low-energy
reporters were included (data not shown).
Logistically it was not possible to concurrently collect 24-h
dietary recalls alongside the 24-h urine collection. Instead 24-h
recalls were collected with children on the day of testing proce-
dures completed at the school site (i.e. actual recalled food intake is
for the day before testing procedures), whereas children could opt
to commence the 24-h urine collection at school on the day of
testing, or over a weekend day. Overall, 416 (91%) children
completed the 24-h dietary recall and 24-h urine collection within a
week of one another. In some instances, because of the child being
unwell on the day of testing or away for an extended holiday
period the timing between the 24-h dietary recall and 24-h urine
collection was greater than a week (i.e. n 29, 7% collected within a
2-week period, and n 14, 3% collected within a 6-week period).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics (mean values and standard deviations or
proportions and numbers) were used to describe participant
characteristics. Because SSB (g/d) intake was skewed, medians
and interquartile ranges were reported. Multiple linear regression
was used to assess the association between urinary Na excretion
(17 mmol/d, equivalent to 1g/d of salt) and BMI z score. Logistic
regression was used to assess the association between 24-h
urinary Na excretion (17mmol/d) and (i) weight category and
(ii) abdominal obesity. The unadjusted and adjusted models (age,
sex and SES) are presented. Where abdominal obesity was the
outcome, additional adjustment for BMI z score was made. To
assess whether the association between 24-h urinary Na excretion
and adiposity outcome measures was independent of energy and
SSB intake, additional models were constructed with these
covariates. In this analysis EI was adjusted using the standard
multivariable method, as opposed to the residual method, as there
was no collinearity between 24-h urinary Na and EI (r 0·10,
P= 0·03). One outlier with an implausible waist circumference
(i.e. 32 cm, which was 3·5
SD away from the mean waist
circumference), was removed from the analyses related to WHtR.
The normality of regression residual distributions was visually
assessed and linearity checked using a component-plus-residual
plot. To account for clustering of students within schools, clustered
robust standard errors were used. Of note, the intra-class
correlation (ICC) for the exposure variable (i.e. Na excretion)
was 0·024 and the ICC for the primary outcome variable (i.e. BMI z
score) was 0·030. Analyses were completed with STATA/SE 13.0
software (StataCorp LP), and a P value<0·05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of participants
and information on urinary excretion and dietary intake.
An overall 55 % were male, 62 % were of high socio-economic
background, and the average age was 9·3 years. In total, 17 % of
children were either overweight or obese and just under a
quarter were classified as centrally obese. Na intake was
2378 mg/d and intakes were higher in older children.
Table 2 shows anthropometric measures and key character-
istics by tertile of 24-h urinary Na excretion. BMI z score and
waist circumference increased with increasing intakes of Na, as
did the proportion of children who were overweight or obese.

 In both 4–7-year olds and 8–12-year olds the prevalence of
abdominal obesity increased with higher intakes of Na.
Concurrent with increases in Na were increases in 24-h
urinary K excretion as well as the urinary Na:K ratio. Among
8–12-year-old children, EI and the amount of food and
beverages consumed on the day of the 24-h diet recall
increased across tertiles of Na intake.
Association between 24-h urinary sodium excretion and
measures of adiposity
Across the whole sample, there was a positive association
between 24-h urinary Na excretion and BMI z score. An addi-
tional 17 mmol/d of Na (1 g salt/d) was associated with a 0·10
higher BMI z score, and Na intake accounted for 7 % of the
variance in BMI z score. The association remained after
adjustment for age, sex and SES (Table 3). When stratified by
age group, the positive association remained in both age
groups. In 8–12-year-old children the association remained after
adjustment for energy and SSB intake.
Results from logistic regression analysis showed that a higher
Na intake was associated with increased risk of being over-
weight or obese. Including all participants and with adjustment
of confounders a 1 g/d higher salt intake was associated with a
23 % increase in the odds of being overweight or obese
(Table 4). The association remained in age-stratified models and
independent of energy and SSB intake in 8–12-year-old
children.
Including all participants, Na intake was positively associated
with abdominal obesity (Table 5). After adjustment for age, sex
and SES an additional 1 g/d of salt was associated with a 15 %
increase in the risk of being centrally obese. In age-stratified
models, the positive association remained. In all models, the
association between salt intake and abdominal obesity was not
independent of BMI z score.
Discussion
Among primary schoolchildren we found that 24-h urinary Na
excretion was associated with a higher BMI z score, greater
risk of overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity. Of note the
association between Na and abdominal obesity was not
independent of BMI z score, suggesting that the potential
adipogenic effect of Na relates to total body weight and is not
specific to central fat distribution. Overall associations were
consistent across stratified age groups; however, the magnitude
of the association was greatest in the 4–7-year-olds on all three
adiposity outcome measures. Some caution should be applied
when interpreting the findings in the 4–7-year-old children
because of the small number of children classified as centrally
obese (n 24) and overweight/obese (n 14).
The magnitude of the effect of 1 g/d of salt on BMI z score is
small (i.e. 0·10), and the potential health significance of this is
unclear. In obese children a reduction of at least 0·5 in BMI
z score is needed to achieve reductions in waist circumference,
body fat and cardiovascular risk(32). However, given intensive
obesity lifestyle interventions report changes of only −0·10 in
BMI z score(33), our finding for an effect of Na alone is not

A
change
of
this
magnitude
may
still
be
important at the population level and in slowing down
the trajectory of excess weight gain during childhood. The
variance in BMI z score and weight status explained by Na
intake alone was 7 and 5 %, respectively. Given the large number
of determinants for childhood obesity, this level of variance
explained
by
a
single
nutrient
is
notable.
Comparatively
sweetened beverages, which are often targeted in childhood
obesity efforts, explained only 1 % of the variance in body weight
status among US children(34).
Overall our findings are consistent with previous studies
conducted in children(6–8,35) as well as adults(7,35–39). For
example, in a large representative sample of Korean children
aged 7–18 years participants in the highest quintile for Na
density, as determined by 24-h dietary recall, were 1·78 (95 % CI
1·13, 2·80) and 2·13 times (95 % CI 1·16, 3·91) more likely to be
obese or centrally obese, respectively(7). Unlike our study, the
authors did not adjust for BMI z score in the Na and abdominal
obesity model; hence, it is unclear whether this association was
independent of overall body size. Similarly in US adolescents,
after adjustment for important confounders including energy,
Na intake assessed by repeated 24-h dietary recalls was
positively associated with BMI, waist circumference and fat
mass(8). In contrast, among Canadian schoolchildren no differ-
ence in Na intake, as assessed by a web-based 24 h recall,
across weight categories was found(40). In adults, a positive
association between Na intake, from 24-h dietary recall meth-
ods, and BMI was reported in nationally representative samples
in the USA(38) and Korea(7).
Only one longitudinal paediatric study has assessed the
association between 24-h urinary Na and obesity risk(41). In this
study of German children aged 3–18 years positive baseline
associations between Na intake and BMI z score and %BF were
reported; however, there was limited evidence for a temporal
relationship. Specifically, in the unadjusted model, baseline Na
was associated with an increase in %BF; however, in adjusted
models this was only a trend (P = 0·073). Conversely there was
no association between baseline Na and change in BMI z score.
Similarly, there was no association between change in Na and
change in either BMI z score or %BF. In adults, in a Danish
longitudinal cohort with 6 years of follow-up, higher 24-h
urinary Na excretion was associated with increased body fat
and decreased fat-free mass, but not with body weight or waist
circumference(41); however, the positive associations were
observed only in adjusted models.
There
are
several
mechanisms
that
may
explain
the
relationship between Na intake and obesity risk. First, as Na
intake is highly correlated to EI (r 0·7)(42) it is possible that
overall greater consumption of foods that are high in both
energy and Na promotes weight gain. Likewise, foods that
contain higher levels of salt may enhance the palatability of
foods, which are also high in fat and energy. In addition,
through the effects of Na on thirst, a salty diet may encourage
greater consumption of high-energy SSB when these are readily
available(3–5). Given that increased EI is a plausible factor that
may link Na to obesity risk, we adjusted for both energy and
SSB intake in the subsample of children with dietary data.
Consistent with others(6–8,38), we found that the association

 between Na intake and BMI z score and weight category was
independent of energy and SSB intake, suggesting other
mechanisms may be at play. However, an important con-
sideration within our study is that we found no association
between EI and BMI z score or weight status (data not shown),
and the association between 24-h urinary Na and EI was very
weak (r 0·10, P = 0·03). Therefore, it is not surprising that the
additional adjustment for energy or SSB intake did not alter our
results. It is possible that, because of limitations associated with
24-h dietary recall methods – for example, estimating portion
size and memory bias(26) – the degree of error in our measure of
EI is large. Comparatively, a urinary biomarker is not subject to
these limitations. In adults important differences in relation to
the assessment method of Na and the relationship to BMI have
previously been reported(43). In this large study of adults who
completed both a 24-h diet recall and 24 h urine collection, it
was shown that 24-h dietary recall Na was inversely associated
with BMI, yet conversely 24-h urinary Na was positively
associated with BMI(43). This emphasises important differences
between the two methodologies.
It may be that the objective measure of 24-h urinary Na acts
as a surrogate marker for overall poorer diet quality(36), which
in turn is linked to obesity risk. In 6-year-old Danish children
greater diet quality was associated with lower 24-h urinary Na
excretion and higher 24-h urinary K excretion(44). Our finding
whereby the urinary Na:K ratio concurrently increased across
tertiles of urinary Na lends some support to the notion that
overall diet quality may be an important factor in explaining the
Na and obesity relationship.
Alternatively it has been suggested that Na may influence
the formation of adipocyte tissue via increased lipogenic
activity(45,46). In rats, those fed a high-Na diet, compared with
those fed a normal-Na diet, had a greater increase in adipocyte
mass despite the same amount of overall food being consumed.
In addition, rats fed the high-Na diet displayed greater uptake of
glucose and conversion into lipids within adipocyte tissue(45).
Whether higher salt intake in humans has a similar effect on
glucose metabolism is unknown. In adults it has been shown that
higher 24-h urinary Na excretion is associated with the metabolic
syndrome(47,48), including abdominal obesity; however, neither of
these studies adjusted for EI.
Limitations of the present study include the cross-sectional
design, convenience sample and the low response rate, which
limits the generalisability of the findings to the wider population.
Compared with the Australian population our sample contained
fewer overweight and obese children(49). We had no dietary data
for children aged 4–7 years and were unable to determine
whether the associations between Na and adiposity outcomes
were independent of energy. Furthermore, the collection of
dietary data and urine samples was not concurrent and there may
have been a positive association between EI and BMI that we
were unable to detect. The major strength of this study is the use
of a urinary biomarker to assess Na intake, removing potential
bias from mis-reporting, a behaviour frequently observed in
dietary studies(26); further, this method captures Na from food
sources as well as discretionary salt use.
In conclusion, our study is in agreement with previous
findings indicating a cross-sectional positive association between
Na intake and measures of adiposity in Australian schoolchildren.
A greater understanding of the potential mechanistic action is
required in conjunction with longitudinal studies.
