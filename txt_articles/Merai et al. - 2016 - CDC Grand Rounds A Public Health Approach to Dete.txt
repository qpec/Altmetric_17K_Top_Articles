Hypertension is generally defined as systolic blood pressure 
≥140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg. A person 
who currently uses blood pressure-lowering medication is also 
defined as having hypertension. Hypertension is a leading risk 
factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke (1,2). Hypertension 
affects nearly one third of U.S. residents aged ≥18 years 
(approximately 75 million persons), and in approximately one 
half of adults with hypertension (nearly 35 million persons), 
it is uncontrolled (2). Among these 35 million U.S. residents 
with uncontrolled hypertension, 33% (11.5 million persons) 
are not aware of their hypertension, 20% (7 million persons) 
are aware of their hypertension, but are not being treated for 
it, and approximately 47% (16.1 million persons) are aware 
of their hypertension and being treated for it, but treatment 
(by medication and/or lifestyle modification) is not adequately 
controlling their blood pressure (Figure) (2).
Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with increased 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and an increased use 
of health care resources (3), with approximately $49 billion 
spent annually in direct and indirect medical expenses (4). 
Seventy-seven percent of persons who have a first stroke have 
hypertension (4). Of the 35 million U.S. residents who have 
uncontrolled hypertension, 81% (30 million) have health 
insurance, 83% (31 million) have a usual source of care, and 
79% (30 million) received medical care in the previous year 
(Table). These data point to gaps and barriers in the current 
system that, if addressed, could lead to improved control of 
hypertension in the U.S. population, and considerable reduc-
tion in hypertension-associated morbidity and mortality.
Accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of hyper-
tension require multiple reliable blood pressure readings over 
time. Missed opportunities to detect and control hypertension 
can arise at the individual level, the care provider level, and at 
the health care system level. Persons might not recognize that 
hypertension is uncontrolled because they do not experience 
symptoms. Many persons find it challenging to follow proper 
medication regimens, or make appropriate lifestyle changes 
such as eating a healthy, low-sodium diet and quitting smoking 
(5). During office visits, providers often must address other 
pressing issues, and might miss opportunities to reinforce 
the importance of, and strategies for, effective blood pressure 
control. At the health care system level, lack of access to blood 
pressure readings done elsewhere within a health care system, or 
concern over the reliability of those readings can lead to missed 
opportunities to diagnose and treat hypertension (6). These 
varied reasons for lack of hypertension control underscore the 
need for multiple approaches and a more coordinated effort 
to reduce the prevalence of hypertension and its associated 
morbidity and mortality.
The Million Hearts Initiative (Million Hearts) is a U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services initiative, that 
focuses on efforts of federal agencies, state and local govern-
ments, health care providers and systems, community-based 
organizations, employers, and persons, with the overall goal 
of preventing one million heart attacks and strokes by 2017 
(7). Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for heart 
attacks and strokes; thus, one major Million Hearts objective is 
to increase by 10 million the number of persons in the United 
States whose hypertension is under control (7). To achieve 
this, Million Hearts aims to enhance detection and control 
of hypertension by facilitating more accurate blood pressure 
measurement and monitoring, improving blood pressure treat-
ment, and increasing awareness of hypertension in populations 
considered at increased risk. This report summarizes specific 
efforts to achieve these aims in two health care systems and a 
public health department.
NorthShore University Health System. NorthShore 
University Health System, in Illinois, is a health care delivery 
system that includes >800 physicians, four community hos-
pitals, and a research institute; NorthShore uses an integrated 
and unified electronic health record (EHR) that stores data 
and makes data accessible across the entire health system. The 
NorthShore Undiagnosed Hypertension Quality Improvement 
Project was established to improve screening to identify patients 
with elevated blood pressure; ensure accuracy and reliability of 
office blood pressure measurement; recognize patients at risk 
at the point of care; and provide clinical decision support tools 
to facilitate appropriate treatment. NorthShore’s Ambulatory 
Primary Care Innovations Group and clinical informatics 
team developed an enterprise-wide hypertension surveillance 
system within the EHR, which included point-of-care alerts 
for both clinic staff and physicians. Data were queried from 
the EHR using several unique algorithms to identify patients 
meeting the criteria for elevated blood pressure, and who might 
have hypertension (8). These algorithms, called NorthShore 
hypertension criteria, were derived from accepted clinical 
practices, guidelines, and research literature. Patients satisfy-
ing at least one of the hypertension criteria were notified that

they might be at risk for hypertension, and urged to schedule 
an automated office blood pressure (AOBP) visit. At AOBP 
visits, a consistent protocol for measuring blood pressure was 
followed to verify whether patients had hypertension. Among 
patients who satisfied the NorthShore hypertension criteria, 
but chose not to come in for an AOBP visit, electronic “best 
practice advisories” alerted clinic staff and physicians each time 
the patient came for an office visit that the patient remained 
at risk for hypertension. These alerts continued until either an 
AOBP was performed, or a blood pressure-related diagnosis 
was placed in the EHR.
During the first 8 months of the project, 435 (52%) of 836 
patients with previously undiagnosed and untreated hyperten-
sion received a hypertension diagnosis using the algorithm 
alerts and confirmatory AOBP readings across the system’s 
23 primary care clinics. For patients meeting the NorthShore 
hypertension criteria, triggering recall to the office, 97% now 
have a diagnosis of hypertension in their EHR, and 94% of 
persons with newly diagnosed hypertension were prescribed 
medication within 90 days of diagnosis. Screening for patients 
with undiagnosed hypertension using EHR data, combined 
with electronic alerts at the point of care was effective in this 
health care setting and reduced the number of undiagnosed 
hypertensive patients.
MedStar Health. MedStar Health is the largest healthcare 
system in the Maryland and Washington, D.C. area with 10 
hospitals, ambulatory care and urgent care centers, approxi-
mately 100 community locations, and during 2012, >160,000 
hospital admissions and 1.5 million outpatient visits. MedStar 
typically records a patient’s blood pressure at every visit. To 
improve hypertension control, MedStar implemented a system-
wide EHR prompt with suggested guidelines recommending 
default blood pressure goals, which took into account comorbid 
conditions, (e.g., diabetes, prior stroke, or acute myocardial 
infarction). If the provider did not further personalize the 
recommended blood pressure goal, the default blood pressure 
goal would autoinsert into the EHR. Once a guideline recom-
mended blood pressure goal was inserted into a patient’s record, 
every subsequent visit to any primary care doctor within the 
MedStar system presented an opportunity to verify that the 
patient’s blood pressure was at the specified goal. Through the 
use of additional prompts, alerts, and patient handouts that 
were automatically generated, providers and patients were made 
aware that a patient’s blood pressure did or did not meet the

recommended goal, and patients were informed if additional 
consultations or treatments should be considered.
One year into MedStar’s program to improve hypertension 
control, the percentage of patients with hypertension and a 
documented evidence-based blood pressure goal increased from 
5% to 92%. The percentage of patients with uncontrolled 
hypertension declined during this same period, from 32% to 
28%. Although these preliminary results represent a modest 
improvement in hypertension control, MedStar has begun 
evaluating best practices from high-performing providers 
and assessing the characteristics of patients with uncontrolled 
hypertension to identify potential next steps to further reduce 
uncontrolled hypertension. 
Philadelphia Department of Public Health. Philadelphia 
has one of the highest hypertension prevalence rates in the 
nation, (44.7% of adult males and 47.6% of adult females 
have hypertension) and has one of the highest rates of uncon-
trolled hypertension (18.9% of adult males and 21.4% of adult 
females) in the United States (9).
In 2010, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health 
(PDPH), through a CDC cooperative agreement, sought to 
improve public health data infrastructure to gather, store, 
analyze, and share more and higher quality data for the entire 
Philadelphia jurisdiction; the agreement focused on hyperten-
sion, adult immunization, and cancer screening. The Office of 
Health Information and Improvement was established within 
the Health Commissioner’s Office, and the PDPH assembled 
a work group to secure hypertension data. The workgroup 
included state agencies, academic health systems, the prison 
system, the county medical society, the federation represent-
ing a majority of the Federally Qualified Health Centers, a 
community health service not-for-profit organization, and the 
regional hospital association. The Office of Health Information 
and Improvement asked this work group to share deidenti-
fied, aggregated data for their total patient population. The 
requested data elements included age, sex, race/ethnicity, and 
insurance type (if known); the number of persons within the 
patient population aged ≥18 years who could be identified as 
hypertensive (using International Classification of Diseases, 9th 
Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] codes); and the 
number of patients who had their blood pressure under control 
(≤140/90 mmHg). In response, partners provided prevalence 
data from EHRs, or administrative databases, along with exist-
ing reports, such as the Uniform Data System.
Data were also received from insurers covering 585,922 of 
Philadelphia’s population aged ≥18 years (just under 50% of 
that age cohort). Overall, hypertension prevalence was 24.2%, 
which was lower than national survey data; however, this might 
be related to the age distribution of the insured population; 
56.1% of the insured patients were aged <44 years. The per-
centage of the hypertensive population with adequately con-
trolled hypertension among payer groups ranged from 35.4% 
to 62.5%, possibly because of the variety of proxy measures 
used (e.g., medication adherence data). Among the payer 
groups, the population with Medicare had the highest preva-
lence of hypertension (79.5%) and the highest prevalence of 
hypertension control (62.5%). Provider data covered 355,057 
adults aged ≥18 years, with an average hypertension prevalence 
of 17.1% and control ranging from 42.1% to 65.7%.
This data exchange enabled PDPH to have a better under-
standing of the variations in hypertension prevalence and 
control, identified considerable gaps in control, and provided 
an impetus to improve. By looking beyond the realm of tra-
ditional public health, PDPH and its partners are working to 
expand dialogue, data exchange, and collaborations to improve 
overall system performance in detecting and controlling high 
blood pressure in this high-need population.
Reaching the Million Hearts hypertension goal of 10 million 
more persons in the United States whose hypertension is under 
control will require more of these innovative efforts in health 
systems and communities. Collaborative and coordinated 
efforts are required to leverage the strengths and resources of 
both public health and health care systems. The NorthShore 
and MedStar Health examples demonstrate how health infor-
mation technology tools can be used to help busy health care 
providers and their patients more effectively detect and control 
high blood pressure. PDPH demonstrates how public health 
can engage stakeholders (e.g., insurers, healthcare systems) to 
work together across systems to address this problem.
