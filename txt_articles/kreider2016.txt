IMPORTANCE An increasing diversity of children’s health coverage options under the US
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, together with uncertainty regarding
reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) beyond 2017, merits
renewed attention on the quality of these options for children.
OBJECTIVE To compare health care access, quality, and cost outcomes by insurance type
(Medicaid, CHIP, private, and uninsured) for children in households with low to moderate
incomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A repeated cross-sectional analysis was conducted
using data from the 2003, 2007, and 2011-2012 US National Surveys of Children’s Health,
comprising 80 655 children 17 years or younger, weighted to 67 million children nationally,
with household incomes between 100% and 300% of the federal poverty level. Multivariable
logistic regression models compared caregiver-reported outcomes across insurance types.
Analysis was conducted between July 14, 2014, and May 6, 2015.
EXPOSURES Insurance type was ascertained using a caregiver-reported measure of insurance
status and each household’s poverty status (percentage of the federal poverty level).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Caregiver-reported outcomes related to access to primary
and specialty care, unmet needs, out-of-pocket costs, care coordination, and satisfaction
with care.
RESULTS Among the 80 655 children, 51 123 (57.3%) had private insurance, 11 853 (13.6%)
had Medicaid, 9554 (18.4%) had CHIP, and 8125 (10.8%) were uninsured. In a multivariable
logistic regression model (with results reported as adjusted probabilities [95% CIs]), children
insured by Medicaid and CHIP were significantly more likely to receive a preventive medical
(Medicaid, 88% [86%-89%]; P < .01; CHIP, 88% [87%-89%]; P < .01) and dental (Medicaid,
80% [78%-81%]; P < .01; CHIP, 77% [76%-79%]; P < .01) visits than were privately insured
children (medical, 83% [82%-84%]; dental, 73% [72%-74%]). Children with all insurance
types experienced challenges in access to specialty care, with caregivers of children insured
by CHIP reporting the highest rates of difficulty accessing specialty care (28% [24%-32%]),
problems obtaining a referral (23% [18%-29%]), and frustration obtaining health care
services (26% [23%-28%]). These challenges were also magnified for privately insured
children with special health care needs, whose caregivers reported significantly greater
problems accessing specialty care (29% [26%-33%]) and frustration obtaining health care
services (36% [32%-41%]) than did caregivers of children insured by Medicaid, and a lower
likelihood of insurance always meeting the child’s needs (63% [60%-67%]) than children
insured by Medicaid or CHIP. Caregivers of privately insured children were also significantly
more likely to experience out-of-pocket costs (77% [75%-78%]) than were caregivers of
children insured by Medicaid (26% [23%-28%]; P < .01) or CHIP (38% [35%-40%]; P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This examination of caregiver experiences across insurance
types revealed important differences that can help guide future policymaking regarding
coverage for families with low to moderate incomes.

U
ntil the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(hereafter Affordable Care Act) was enacted in 2010,
children in families with low to moderate incomes
could receive subsidized health insurance through either Med-
icaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The
Affordable Care Act added a third option through the cre-
ation of qualified health plans (QHPs), which are sold on the
federal and state exchanges and subsidized for individuals and
familieswithincomesofupto400%ofthefederalpovertylevel
(FPL). This new insurance option for children in families with
low to moderate incomes has stimulated a debate regarding
children’s health insurance coverage. Some hypothesize that
the QHPs, born from the commercial market, might eclipse the
needforCHIPcoveragealthoughtheAffordableCareActmain-
tained both options. A recent, short-term extension of CHIP
funding by Congress through 2017 now prolongs this debate.1
The early experience with QHPs has been equivocal. While
QHPs are required to include a package of essential health ben-
efits,includingpediatricbenefits,thesebenefitsarenotdefined
consistentlyacrossstates.2Inaddition,theQHPsreflectbenefit
and cost-sharing standards in the private market. Despite the
AffordableCareAct’scost-sharingsubsidies,familiesinthepri-
vatemarkethaveexperiencedhighercostscomparedwithfami-
lies with CHIP coverage.3-8 Children enrolled in Medicaid and

childrenenrolledinMedicaid,whileaccesstodental,vision,and

Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treat-
ment program, it is not required in stand-alone CHIP plans.9
However, lower reimbursement rates in Medicaid have been
linked to reduced access to health care providers, particularly
for specialty services in pediatrics, compared with private
insurance.10-12Finally,privateinsurancecansubjectfamiliesto

Methods
Design and Participants
We conducted a repeated cross-sectional analysis using
public- and restricted-use data from the 2003, 2007, and 2011-
2012 NSCH surveys.21 Analysis was conducted between July
14, 2014, and May 6, 2015. The NSCH is a nationally represen-
tative,telephone-basedsurveyconductedbytheNationalCen-
ter for Health Statistics (the 2003 and 2007 surveys were land-
line-based samples; the 2011-2012 survey included a cellular
telephone subsample). The NSCH included questions about
children’s health status, access to and use of health care, in-
surance status, demographics, and household information, in-
cluding household educational level, household income, and
family structure. A knowledgeable adult, typically a parent,
provided information about the sampled children. Analysis of
deidentified data from the survey is exempt from federal regu-
lations for the protection of human research participants.
The analysis focused on families with incomes between
100% and 300% of the FPL because within this income seg-
ment, children could qualify for either Medicaid or CHIP de-
pending on their state’s eligibility thresholds.22 Children from
Vermont were excluded owing to special eligibility rules that
made determination of public coverage type difficult. Chil-
dren from Tennessee were excluded owing to unavailable
Medicaid-to-Medicare fee index data. Children with func-
tionallimitationswereexcludedbecausetheyweremorelikely
to have non–income-based eligibility for Medicaid (eg, disabil-
ity),makingclassificationofpublicinsurancetypedifficult.Sub-
group analyses were performed among young children (aged
≤5 years) and children with special health care needs; these
analyses provide additional context regarding the experience
of groups likely to have greater needs for health care services.
Classification of Insurance Status
Using caregiver-reported measures of current insurance sta-
tus from the NSCH, children were classified as uninsured, pub-
licly insured, or privately insured. The NSCH does not sepa-
rately ascertain enrollment in Medicaid vs CHIP. Thus, to
disaggregate children likely to be enrolled in Medicaid vs CHIP,

At a Glance
• Data from the National Survey of Children’s Health were used
to derive public insurance eligibility status and compare access to
and use of health care across 4 insurance coverage types
(Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program [CHIP],
private insurance, and uninsured) for children in households
with low to moderate incomes.
• Children insured by Medicaid or CHIP experienced greater access
to preventive medical (Medicaid and CHIP, 88%) and dental
(Medicaid, 80%; CHIP, 77%) care than did privately insured
children (medical, 83%; dental, 73%).
• Children with all types of insurance experienced challenges in
accessing specialty care, with as many as 1 in 4 children having
difficulty seeing a specialist; however, these challenges were
amplified for children insured by CHIP (28%) and for privately
insured children with special health care needs (29%).
• Caregivers of privately insured children were much more likely to
experience out-of-pocket costs (77%) than were caregivers of
children insured by Medicaid (26%) or CHIP (38%).

that poverty status to the public insurance income eligibility
thresholds relevant to the child’s state and age group within
the given survey year, using eligibility information from the
Kaiser Family Foundation.23-25 To examine possible misclas-
sification of coverage type, we compared our state-level,
NSCH-derived enrollment estimates with administrative
enrollment data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services for each year.19,26 Estimates of Medicaid enrollment
were consistently lower than rates reported by the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services, consistent with prior
research.27 However, we obtained high correlation coeffi-
cients between simulated and actual enrollment totals across
states and time within programs (Medicaid, 0.90; CHIP, 0.98).
Uninsured children were included in the analyses as a refer-
ence point with which to interpret the level of access and use
of health care services experienced by insured children.
By including data across 3 years of NSCH surveys, we
sought to exploit differences within and across states in in-
come-based eligibility requirements over time. Many states
changed these requirements between 2003 and 2012. For
example, a 7-year-old child in Missouri with a household in-
come of 175% of the FPL would have been eligible for Medicaid
in 2003 but by 2007 would instead have been eligible for CHIP.

see the eAppendix in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Multivariable logistic regression models compared child-
level outcomes across insurance types. All models adjusted for
calendar year, income strata (100%-150%, >150%-200%, and
>200%-300% of the FPL), child-level demographic and house-
holdcharacteristics(age,sex,race/ethnicity,specialhealthcare
needs, household educational level, family structure, and
urbanicity as measured by residence in a metropolitan statis-
tical area), and state-level characteristics (Medicaid-to-
Medicare fee index, poverty rate, and unemployment rate).
State-level characteristics were included to adjust for the gen-
erosity of public insurance and account for other state-
specific economic factors that could affect the access environ-
ment. Within each income stratum there were children who
were enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP, both within and across
states. Subanalyses were conducted to examine outcomes
stratified by income; these subanalyses included an interac-
tion term between insurance type and income strata. A robust
variance estimator accommodated the correlation due to clus-
teringofchildrenwithinstates.Modelswereproperlyweighted
to accommodate the complex survey design and nonre-
sponse.Modelestimateswereusedtogeneratepredictedprob-
abilities of each outcome by insurance type, standardized by
childandstatecharacteristics.Importantdifferenceswereiden-
tified based on a combination of several criteria: statistically
significant differences in odds ratio contrasts between
Medicaid, CHIP, and private insurance (P < .05); clinically rel-
evant differences across insurance types in the adjusted mar-
ginal probabilities of the outcome; and consistency in results
across outcome domains to mitigate the problem of multiple
comparisons. All analyses were performed in Stata, version 13
(StataCorp), including the svy suite of commands.
Results
The study sample was 80 655 children, weighted to 67 mil-
lion children nationally. Among the 80 655 children, 51 123
(57.3%) had private insurance, 11 853 (13.6%) had Medicaid,
9554 (18.4%) had CHIP, and 8125 (10.8%) were uninsured. Pri-
vately insured children were more likely than other children
to be white, come from 2-parent households, and come from
households where a caregiver’s educational level was higher
than high school (Table 1). Medicaid-insured children were
younger, on average, and publicly insured children were more
likely to have special health care needs than other children.
Predicted probabilities of outcomes by insurance type,
standardized by child and state characteristics, are presented
in Table 2. For ease of interpretation, these predicted prob-
abilities are described as predicted percentages below. Re-
sults stratified by FPL are presented in eTables 1 through 9 in
the Supplement.
Standardized Estimates of Preventive and Specialty Care
In a multivariable logistic regression model (with results re-
ported as adjusted probabilities [95% CIs]), 88% (86%-89%)
of children insured by Medicaid and 88% (87%-89%) of those
insured by CHIP had a preventive medical visit compared with
83% (82%-84%) of privately insured children (P < .001 for both
contrasts). In addition, publicly insured children were more
likely than privately insured children to receive a preventive
dental visit: 80% (78%-81%) of children insured by Medicaid

and 77% (76%-79%) of those insured by CHIP had such a visit
compared with 73% (72%-74%) of privately insured children
(P < .001 and P = .001, respectively). Uninsured children were
substantially less likely than insured children to receive pre-
ventive care visits, have a personal physician or nurse, or have
a usual source of care (P < .001 for all contrasts).
In contrast to preventive care, children with all insurance
typesexperiencedchallengesinspecialtycareaccess,butthose
insured by CHIP had more difficulty accessing specialty care
than did privately insured children. For example, 15% (13%-
18%) of privately insured children and 18% (14%-23%) of Med-
icaid-insured children had difficulty obtaining a referral when
needed compared with 23% (18%-29%) of those insured by
CHIP (P = .01 and P = .11, respectively). Similarly, across all in-
surance types, more than 1 in 5 families needing specialty care
had difficulty obtaining access, with children insured by CHIP
having modestly higher rates of difficulty (28% [24%-32%])
compared with children enrolled in Medicaid (P = .06) and
private insurance (P = .03).
Standardized Estimates of Perception of Unmet Needs
Unmet medical and dental needs were uncommon for in-
sured children: only 2% (2%-2%) of privately insured chil-
dren, 2% (2%-3%) of those insured by Medicaid, and 3%
(3%-4%) of those insured by CHIP had unmet medical needs
compared with 10% (8%-12%) of uninsured children (P < .001
for all 3 contrasts). This pattern was similar for unmet dental
needs. However, children insured by Medicaid and CHIP were
more likely to have insurance that always met their needs
(Medicaid, 78% [76%-80%]; CHIP, 78% [75%-80%]) than were
privately insured children (73% [72%-75%]) (P = .002 and
P = .004, respectively). The caregivers of more than 80% of
children across all insurance types reported satisfaction with
the ability to see needed health care providers (Medicaid, 82%
[80%-84%];CHIP,84%[82%-86%];andprivateinsurance,83%
[82%-84%]).
Standardized Estimates of Care Coordination, Satisfaction
With Care, and Out-of-Pocket Costs
Twenty percent (17%-23%) of caregivers of children enrolled
in Medicaid reported frustration obtaining health care ser-
vices compared with 23% (21%-24%) for privately insured chil-
dren and 26% (23%-28%) for those insured by CHIP. Respon-
dents insured by CHIP were significantly more likely to report
suchfrustrationthanthosewithMedicaidplans(P = .004).Ap-
proximately 70% of insured respondents received care coor-
dination when needed across all plan types (Medicaid, 72%
[68%-75%];CHIP,68%[65%-72%];andprivateinsurance,70%
[68%-72%]) compared with less than half (47% [41%-53%]) of
uninsured respondents (P < .001 for all 3 contrasts). A similar
pattern was found for receipt of family-centered care. In con-
trast, caregivers of privately insured children had the highest

prevalence of out-of-pocket costs (77% [75%-78%]) com-
pared with caregivers of children insured by Medicaid (26%
[23%-28%]; P < .001) and CHIP (38% [35%-40%]; P < .001).
Young Children and Children
With Special Health Care Needs
The analysis of children with special health care needs
revealed additional challenges for privately insured children
(Table 3). For example, 29% (26%-33%) of caregivers of pri-
vately insured children reported a problem accessing a spe-
cialist compared with caregivers of children insured by CHIP
(25% [20%-31%]; P = .25) and Medicaid (20% [15%-25%];
P = .007). In addition, only 63% (60%-67%) of respondents
with privately insured children reported that their insurance
always met their needs, well below that observed in CHIP
(73% [68%-77%]; P = .006) and Medicaid (76% [71%-81%];
P < .001). Thirty-six percent (32%-41%) of respondents with
privately insured children expressed frustration obtaining
health care services compared with 28% (21%-34%) of those
insured by Medicaid (P = .05). Finally, caregivers of privately
insured children were most likely to experience out-of-
pocket costs (80% [78%-83%]) compared with caregivers of
children insured by CHIP (40% [35%-46%]; P < .001) and
Medicaid (23% [18%-27%]; P < .001).
In contrast, caregivers of younger children (aged ≤5 years)
reported access challenges for specialty care that were similar
to the aggregate responses reported above, with an exception:
caregivers of younger children with both private insurance
(18% [13%-22%]; P = .01) and CHIP (19% [12%-26%]; P = .01)
reported greater problems obtaining referrals than did those
insured by Medicaid (9% [5%-13%]) (Table 4). In addition, less
than half of children aged 5 years or younger with private
insurance received a preventive dental visit (48% [46%-50%])
compared with those insured by Medicaid (56% [52%-59%];
P = .001) and CHIP (60% [56%-64%]; P < .001). Caregivers of
privately insured children (21% [19%-24%]; P = .05) and those
with children insured by CHIP (27% [22%-32%]; P = .001) had
higher rates of frustration obtaining health care services than
did those with children insured by Medicaid (16% [13%-20%]).
Similar to other families, caregivers with young children expe-
rienced the highest likelihood of out-of-pocket costs with pri-
vate insurance (71% [68%-74%]) compared with children
insured by CHIP (27% [22%-32%]; P < .001) and Medicaid
(21% [17%-25%]; P < .001).

Discussion
This study examined the experiences with health insurance
coverage for families with incomes between 100% and
300% of the FPL and found consistently high levels of pre-
ventive care receipt for all insured children. However, pre-
ventive medical and dental visits were more prevalent for
children insured by Medicaid and CHIP than for privately
insured children. These findings are consistent with other
published studies and demonstrate reassuringly high rates
of access to dental care for children insured by Medicaid
and CHIP.10,13,17,18 However, as many as 1 in 4 caregivers
reported difficulty accessing specialty care and frustration
obtaining health care services, with some evidence of
greater difficulty among those enrolled in CHIP. In addition,
nearly one-third of caregivers of privately insured children
with special health care needs reported such challenges.
This finding is consistent with a recent study of children
with special health care needs that found greater adequacy
of coverage in public insurance than in private insurance.31
Finally, caregivers of privately insured children were sub-
stantially more likely to experience out-of-pocket costs than
were those with children insured by Medicaid or CHIP, with
the lowest likelihood of out-of-pocket costs being for those
covered by Medicaid.
The implications of our findings are best considered
within the shifting landscape of children’s insurance cover-
age. Under the Affordable Care Act, QHPs are expanding
the availability of private insurance for families with low
incomes, but the early experiences with QHPs have been
mixed. First, QHPs are required to include 10 essential
health benefits. However, a recent review of state bench-
mark plans (on which QHPs are based) revealed that no plan
included a definition of pediatric services, one of the
required benefits.2 Second, cost sharing has been found to
be higher in QHPs, mirroring trends in the private insurance
market.5 Third, new practices in the private market (specifi-
cally, tiering of provider networks) are a concern in QHPs.
These practices could adversely affect specialty access in
pediatrics due to unique shortages of specialty health care
providers and concentrations of such providers in children’s
hospital networks.2,8
Our findings provide empirical data for the ongoing
debate about subsidized coverage for children. The high re-
ported rates of preventive care receipt and perception of

Medicaid and CHIP coverage meeting children’s needs, to-
gether with concerns about limited access and increased cost
sharing in private plans, might caution against calls for ex-
panded private (ie, QHP) coverage for children and substan-
tiateadvocacyforextendingCHIPcoveragebeyond2017.How-
ever,thisstudyuncoveredsomechallengesinaccesstoservices
and specialty care for both children with CHIP coverage and
privately insured children with special health care needs. Al-
though the etiology of these challenges is not well under-
stood, these findings suggest that Medicaid might serve chil-
dreninfamilieswithlowtomoderateincomesbetterthanother
coverage types.
Nonetheless, strengthened insurance exchanges could
provide an option for families with low to moderate incomes
to purchase coverage. The goal would be the creation of a
continuum of family coverage, from Medicaid plans to
QHPs, but concerns about access to specialty care, affordable
dental coverage, and cost sharing would require attention.
One way to ensure the comprehensiveness of coverage cur-
rently available in states’ Medicaid programs would be to
require QHPs to match those programs’ benefit and cost-
sharing provisions. Finally, creating protections in the QHP
market by limiting tiering of regionally scarce specialty pedi-
atric health care providers could curtail the concerns about
access to specialty care reported for children with special
health care needs in this study.
We acknowledge the following limitations. First, the
survey reported point-in-time insurance measures coupled
with income and coverage quality measures from the prior
12 months. It is possible that coverage and eligibility at the
time of the survey was not reflective of families’ experi-
ences throughout the year. Second, there was potential for
misclassification of insurance type. We attempted to mini-
mize misclassification by excluding children with functional
limitations, whose Medicaid eligibility might have been
based on disabilities. In addition, while our methods for
classifying children into Medicaid and CHIP coverage have
not been externally validated, we were reassured that
the correlations between our NSCH-derived enrollment
estimates for CHIP and Medicaid and administrative esti-
mates across states and time were very high. Nevertheless,
the extent to which some children’s insurance type was
misclassified might have biased results toward the null.
Third, the amount of out-of-pocket expenses would have
been preferable to the binary variable for any out-of-pocket
costs used in our analysis. Others have reported much
