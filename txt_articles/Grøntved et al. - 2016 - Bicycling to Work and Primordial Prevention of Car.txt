Background-—Bicycling to work may be a viable approach for achieving physical activity that provides cardiovascular health
benefits. In this study we investigated the relationship of bicycling to work with incidence of obesity, hypertension,
hypertriglyceridemia, and impaired glucose tolerance across a decade of follow-up in middle-aged men and women.
Methods and Results-—We followed 23 732 Swedish men and women with a mean age of 43.5 years at baseline who attended a
health examination twice during a 10-year period (1990–2011). In multivariable adjusted models we calculated the odds of incident
obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and impaired glucose tolerance, comparing individuals who commuted to work by
bicycle with those who used passive modes of transportation. We also examined the relationship of change in commuting mode
with incidence of these clinical risk factors. Cycling to work at baseline was associated with lower odds of incident obesity (odds
ratio [OR]=0.85, 95% CI 0.73–0.99), hypertension (OR=0.87, 95% CI 0.79–0.95), hypertriglyceridemia (OR=0.85, 95% CI 0.76–
0.94), and impaired glucose tolerance (OR=0.88, 95% CI 0.80–0.96) compared with passive travel after adjusting for putative
confounding factors. Participants who maintained or began bicycling to work during follow-up had lower odds of obesity (OR=0.61,
95% CI 0.50–0.73), hypertension (OR=0.89, 95% CI 0.80–0.98), hypertriglyceridemia (OR=0.80, 95% CI 0.70–0.90), and impaired
glucose tolerance (OR=0.82, 95% CI 0.74–0.91) compared with participants not cycling to work at both times points or who
switched from cycling to other modes of transport during follow-up.
Conclusions-—These data suggest that commuting by bicycle to work is an important strategy for primordial prevention of clinical
cardiovascular risk factors among middle-aged men and women. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5: e004413 doi: 10.1161/

ncouraging population-wide engagement in physical
activity is a key priority for most established health
agencies. Active transportation (or active commuting) by
means of walking or bicycling to and from work and for other
purposes (eg, grocery shopping and transporting children) is a
type of physical activity that can be built into everyday life; for
many, it constitutes a substantial proportion of the total daily
health-enhancing physical activity and provides cost- and
time-effective alternatives to commuting by car or public
transport. Besides raising physical activity levels, active
transportation may also reduce traffic congestion and air
and noise pollution1 that plague many cities.
Whereas active transportation and walking have previously
been associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and
premature mortality in prospective studies in different pop-
ulations

 prospective studies have specifically assessed the cardiovas-
cular health benefits associated with commuting by bicycle,
and no study has assessed the impact of changing commuting
mode to work. Estimating the magnitude and population
impact of the cardiovascular benefits of commuter cycling is
important because this would help inform health policy
decision making and facilitate the prioritization of public
health resources. Previous studies have estimated that
physical inactivity is responsible for a substantial economic
burden on healthcare systems.4,5
In this study, we examined the prospective relationships of
cycling to work at baseline with change in commuter cycling
with 10-year incidence of obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyc-
eridemia, and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in a large
population-based cohort of men and women from Northern
Sweden. We also assessed whether genetic and other
candidate factors modified the relationships and examined
the percentage of these incident clinical risk factors for
cardiovascular disease that could be prevented in this cohort
if all participants remained cycling or switched to commuting
by bicycle to work during a 10-year follow-up period.
Methods
Study Population and Study Design
The V€
asterbottens Health Survey, also called the V€
asterbot-
tens Intervention Program, is a population-based health
investigation where risk factors and outcomes are monitored
and participants are given rudimentary advice on healthy
lifestyle behaviors. This public health strategy, which was
implemented to reduce premature cardiovascular disease,
started recruiting participants in 1990. Persons living within
the county of V€
asterbottens are invited to participate during
the year of their 40th, 50th, and 60th birthdays. The study
includes an individual counseling session and health exami-
nation at a local primary care center. A detailed description of
the study can be found elsewhere.6 The participation rate so
far has been 58% among men and 65% among women.
Participants with a second health examination available up
until January 2011 were eligible for the present study. A total
of 32 728 people participated twice in the period from 1990
to 2011. Among these we excluded participants if they
reported being unemployed or retired at baseline (n=1782)
and if they had missing information on commuting mode,
relevant covariates, and outcomes (cardiovascular risk fac-
tors), respectively (n=7214), leaving up to 23 732 partici-
pants
with
data
for
analyses
(n=22 072
for
2-hour
postprandial glucose and n=19 751 for triglyceride [TG]).
The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee at
Ume�
a University (DNR 07-142€
O) and all participants gave
informed consent.
Commuting Mode, Leisure Time Exercise, and
Occupational Physical Activity
Information on leisure time exercise, occupational physical
activity, and work commuting mode were obtained by self-
report questionnaire. Work commute mode was queried
separately by season (winter, spring, summer, fall) with
response options by car, bus, walking, and bicycling. Partic-
ipants traveling by car and bus were collapsed to a passive
commuting mode group. The predominant mode of travel
during the 4 seasons (at least 3 out of 4 seasons) among
participants was used to classify the most typical transport
mode. Participants with irregular travel mode to work were
grouped together (up to 2 seasons). Thus, we categorized
transport mode in 4 categories: passive travel, irregular travel
mode, walking, and cycling. Commuting distance was also
asked about in an open-ended question. Leisure time exercise
was estimated by asking how often the participant had
exercised in training clothes for the past 3 months with
response options of never, rarely, once per week, 2–3 times
per week, or more than 3 times per week. Participants were
also asked about their occupational physical activity with the
following response options: seated or standing, light, light and
active, sometimes heavy, heavy most of the time.
Cardiovascular Risk Factors
Weight (to the nearest 0.1 kg) and height (to the nearest
1 cm) were measured with participants wearing indoor
clothing without shoes, and body mass index (BMI) was
calculated. Obesity was defined as a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. Until
2009, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) was mea-
sured once after 5 minutes rest with the participant in a
supine position and after September 1, 2009 it was measured
twice with a mercury sphygmomanometer and the average of
these 2 was recorded. Hypertension was defined according to
the American Heart Association definition, ie, if the systolic or
diastolic BP exceeded 140 and 90 mm Hg and/or use of
antihypertensive medications. For participants reporting tak-
ing antihypertensive medication, BP values were corrected by
adding 15 mm Hg to measured systolic BP and 10 mm Hg to
measured diastolic BP.7 A capillary blood sample was
obtained after an overnight fast (at least 8 hours of fasting),
and a second blood sample was drawn 2 hours after a
standard 75-g oral glucose load following World Health
Organization standards in participants who did not have
fasting blood glucose values indicative of diabetes mellitus. TG
and glucose were measured in plasma by enzymatic methods
with a Reflotron benchtop analyzer (Roche Diagnostics
Scandinavia AB). We corrected TG levels (+0.207 mmol/L)
among participants who reporting taking lipid-lowering med-
ications according to Wu et al.8 IGT was defined as a 2-hour

 were part of the GLACIER Study,12 which is nested within the
Northern Sweden Biobank.
Covariates
Information was also gathered by questionnaire on the
participants’ educational status, employment, smoking habits,
alcohol intake, and diet (validated semiquantitative food
frequency questionnaire).13 We obtained this information both
at baseline and follow-up. Education was defined according to
the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED),
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organiza-
tion (UNESCO) 1997. From the validated food frequency
questionnaire, we obtained information on total energy intake
(kcal/day), coffee intake (g/day), alcohol intake (g/day), fruit
(daily frequency), vegetables (daily frequency), trans fat (g/
day), and fiber (g/day) consumption. Participants with calcu-
lated total energy intake of <500 kcal/day or >4500 kcal/
day were excluded (n=120).
Statistical Analyses
Multivariable-adjusted effects of commuting mode at baseline
with continuous and dichotomous risk factor outcomes at
follow-up were estimated with linear and logistic regression,
respectively. Participants with prevalent obesity, hyperten-
sion, hypertriglyceridemia, or IGT at baseline were excluded
from analyses where these traits were modeled as outcomes.
Basic models were adjusted for age at baseline, follow-up
time, baseline levels of risk factor (eg BMI in risk of obesity
analyses),
and
sex.
Fully
adjusted
models
additionally
included leisure time exercise (categorical variable), occupa-
tional physical activity (categorical variable), smoking habits
(none/former/current), education (basic education including
primary and secondary education, postsecondary nontertiary
education, tertiary education according to International Stan-
dard Classification of Education level [1997]), alcohol con-
sumption (quintiles), coffee intake (quintiles), total energy
intake (continuous), fruit intake (quintiles), vegetable intake
(quintiles), intake of trans fat (quintiles), and fiber intake
(quintiles).
To estimate the dose-dependent relationship of cycling to
work with incident cardiovascular risk and risk factor levels at
follow-up, we modeled the frequency of bicycling to work by
season (0–4 seasons) and the back-and-forth distance to
work (noncyclists, cycling ≤2 km, cycling >2–8 km, cycling
>8 km). Furthermore, we analyzed change in bicycling to
work from baseline to follow-up adjusting for baseline- and
follow-up measures of covariates. We did this in several ways;
first, we restricted our analysis to participants reporting

 passive travel to work at baseline and estimated the odds of
incident risk factors by categories of commuting mode at
follow-up. Second, we restricted our analysis to participants
reporting cycling to work at baseline and estimated the odds
of incident risk factors by categories of commuting mode at
follow-up. In these 2 sets of analyses, we combined irregular
mode travelers and walkers as the number of participants in
these groups was modest. Third, we estimated the odds of
incident risk factors comparing participants who maintained
or began bicycling to work during follow-up with participants
not cycling to work at both times points or who switched from
cycling to other transport modes during follow-up. Based on
this, we calculated the proportion of cases of incident
cardiovascular risk factors that could be prevented in the
total population if all participants remained or switched to
bicycling to work during the 10 years of follow-up. The
population attributable fraction estimates with 95% CI were
calculated according to the method described by Greenland
and Drescher14 based on calculation of multivariable adjusted
odds ratios (ORs) and assuming that these estimates
represent unbiased causal relationships. In addition, we
evaluated possible heterogeneity of relationships of change
in bicycling to work with incident risk factors differing by
smoking status, leisure time exercise, sex, educational status,
and FTO rs9939609 genotype. In all models of change in
commuting mode to work, participants who reported being
unemployed or retired at follow-up were additionally excluded
from analysis.
To evaluate the possibility of selection bias due to missing
data, we carried out multiple imputation analyses according to
Royston15 by comparing estimates of associations in the
sample with complete data on covariates and outcome
(n=19 751–23 732) with the full sample (n=32 728) with
missing values being imputed. A multivariate chained equa-
tion imputation approach including all covariates and respec-
tive outcomes was used to impute missing values. Regression

 coefficients and SEs were obtained based on 30 imputed data
sets. The imputation analyses were based on the linear
regression models (continuous cardiovascular outcomes) as
these were less computational.
All analyses were conducted in STATA (StataCorp. 2013.

StataCorp LP).
Results
At baseline, passive travel to work was the most common
travel mode (59%) followed by bicycling (24%), walking (11%),
and irregular traveling (6%). These percentages were similar at
follow-up (59%, 22%, 14%, and 5%, respectively). The odds of
cycling to work at follow-up was 10.4 (95% CI 9.6–11.3) times
higher when comparing noncyclists with cyclists at baseline.
During a median of 10 years of follow-up, the number of
incident cases of obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia,
and IGT were 1862 (8.6%), 4718 (25.3%), 2913 (18.4%), and
4230 (21.0%), respectively. Table 1 shows characteristics of
the participants by categories of commuting mode at
baseline. All baseline characteristics were statistically signif-
icantly related to mode of travel to work after adjustment for
sex. Overall, based on the distribution of baseline character-
istics, participants reporting bicycling to work were healthier,
better educated, and more often female compared with
passive commuters.
Table 2 shows the association of commuting mode at
baseline and incident cardiovascular risk factors at follow-up.
In the basic models, bicycling to work was associated with
lower odds of incident obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyc-
eridemia, and IGT compared with passive travel. Further
adjustment for other putative cardiovascular risk factors did
not substantially change results; however, all ORs were
slightly attenuated. We found similar patterns of associations
in the analyses where cardiovascular risk factors at follow-up

leisure time exercise, occupational physical activity, smoking status, educational status, alcohol consumption, coffee intake, total energy intake,
fruit intake, vegetable intake, intake of trans fat, and fiber intake. BMI indicates body mass index.

 were modeled as continuous outcomes (Table S1). In fully
adjusted models, bicycling to work was associated with lower
levels of BMI, TG, systolic and diastolic BP, and 2-hour glucose
compared with passive travel. Walking to work was unrelated
to incident risk factors (Table 2) and risk factor levels at
follow-up (Table S1) in fully adjusted models.
To evaluate dose-dependent relationships for bicycling to
work and cardiovascular risk factor progression, we then
examined the association of frequency of bicycling to work at
baseline by season and according to distance back-and-forth
to work with incident cardiovascular risk and risk factor levels
at follow-up. In multivariable adjusted analyses, we found
evidence of dose–response relationships with increasing
number of seasons bicycling for all incident factors (Figure 1)
and lower risk factor levels (Table S2). The analyses of cycling
distance to work also revealed indications of dose-dependent
relationships to all cardiovascular risk factors (Figure 2).
We then examined the associations of various changes in
commuting mode with cardiovascular risk. In analyses
restricted to participants reporting passive travel to work at
baseline and who reported cycling to work at follow-up, the
odds of incident obesity (OR=0.64, 95% CI 0.49–0.84,
P<0.001), hypertension (OR=0.88, 95% CI 0.75–1.03), hyper-
triglyceridemia (OR=0.76, 95% CI 0.62–0.92, P=0.006), and
IGT (OR=0.79, 95% CI 0.68–0.93, P=0.005) were lower
compared with participants who remained using passive travel
(Figure 3). Furthermore, participants who remained cycling to
work had lower odds of incident obesity (OR=0.43, 95% CI
0.30–0.63,
P<0.001)
compared
with
participants
who
switched to passive travel (Figure 4), while relationships to
hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and IGT were nonsignifi-
cant. Generally, these relationships of change in commuting
mode with cardiovascular risk factors were supported by
similar analyses with continuous risk factor levels in linear
Figure 3. Data are odds ratios (95% CI) of incident cardiovascular risk factors comparing participants using passive travel to work at baseline
and remaining passive (reference) or switching to walking or irregular mode, or cycling as transport to work at follow-up. Models were adjusted
for age at baseline, follow-up time, baseline levels of risk factor (eg BMI in risk of obesity analyses), sex, baseline educational status, and
baseline- and follow-up information on leisure time exercise, occupational physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, coffee intake,
total energy intake, intake of fruit, intake of vegetables, intake of trans fat, and fiber intake. BMI indicates body mass index.

 regression models, although these analyses showed that
participants who remained cycling to work had significantly
lower follow-up levels of BMI, systolic BP, TG, and 2-hour
glucose compared with those who remained using passive
travel (Table S3).
The odds of incident risk factors were significantly lower in
participants who maintained or began bicycling to work during
follow-up compared to participants who did not cycle to work
at either time point or who switched from cycling to other
more passive modes of transport during follow-up (Table 3).
These relationships were also fairly similar between men and
women, across categories of educational status, smoking
status, and regardless of engagement in leisure-time exercise
(Figure 5). Furthermore, there was no evidence of the FTO
rs9939609 variant modifying the relationship of change in
bicycling to work with BMI or odds of obesity (P>0.6 for
interaction). The estimated percentage of incident cardiovas-
cular risk factor events that could be prevented in the total
population if all participants maintained or began to cycle to
work during 10 years of follow-up are also shown in Table 3.
The attributable fraction percentage for obesity was 24%,
suggesting that approximately a quarter of the new cases of
obesity occurring during these 10 years of follow-up could be
prevented in this population if all participants remained- or
switched to cycling to work. The attributable fraction
percentages
for
hypertension,
hypertriglyceridemia,
and
impaired fasting glucose were 6%, 13%, and 11%, respectively.
The analyses imputing missing values among up to 7214
participants in a multivariate approach suggested fairly similar
10-year follow-up cardiovascular benefits associated with
cycling to work at baseline: BMI �0.16 kg/m2 (95% CI �0.23
to �0.09); systolic BP �1.01 mm Hg (95% CI �1.48 to

Discussion
Findings from this study among a population-based sample of
more than 20 000 Swedish men and women followed for
10 years show that bicycling to work lowers the risk of
clinically relevant cardiovascular risk factors (ie, obesity,
hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and IGT) compared with
passive travel. There was some evidence of dose–response
relationships of frequency of bicycling to work and commut-
ing distance with these incident cardiovascular risk out-
comes, and the associations were independent of major
confounding
factors.
The
analyses
of
10-year
incident
cardiovascular risk were supported by analyses of continuous
cardiovascular risk factors; participants reporting bicycling to
work at baseline had lower levels of systolic and diastolic BP,
BMI, TG, and 2-hour postprandial glucose at follow-up
compared with participants reporting passive travel. Further-
more, our analyses of change in commuting mode addition-
ally support that remaining cycling to work or switching from
passive travel to cycling lowers the risk of these cardiovas-
cular risk outcomes, and there was no evidence that these
relationships differed by genetic or other characteristics. If
we assume that these associations are causal, we estimate
that 24%, 6%, 13%, and 11% of individuals developing obesity,
hypertension,
hypertriglyceridemia, and
IGT, respectively
could be prevented if all individuals in this population
remained with or switched to bicycling as commuting mode
to work. Thus, the public health impact of substituting
bicycling to work for other forms of transport or making sure
that people remain using their bicycle to commute to work
may be substantial.
While a number of cross-sectional studies on the associ-
ation of bicycling to work and prevalent cardiovascular risk
factors have been carried out,16–18 we are not aware of any
prospective studies examining specific associations for bicy-
cling to work. A report from the Nurses’ Health Study II has
shown that an increase in time spent recreational bicycling
was associated with lower change in weight over 16 years in
premenopausal women.19 A cross-sectional study based on a
representative sample of adults from the United Kingdom
reports lower odds of prevalent hypertension and diabetes
mellitus among individuals bicycling to work compared with
individuals using private passive transport mode.17 Similarly, a
recent cross-sectional study among adults residing in India
found that individuals reporting bicycling to work were less
likely to have hypertension or diabetes mellitus than those
reporting traveling to work by private passive transport.16 We
are aware of 2 prospective studies examining the association
of bicycling to work or for other purposes with the risk of
mortality. A study in Chinese women20 and a study conducted
among Danish men and women21 each reported bicycling to
work and for other reasons being inversely associated with
the risk of all-cause mortality compared with passive travel.
Another recent published study of Danish middle-aged and
older adults reports that bicycling to work is related to lower
risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.22 In a Dutch cohort study,
engagement in nonspecific bicycling was associated with
lower risk of cardiovascular disease.23 Furthermore, in a
nested case–control study, we have previously reported that
compared with bicycling to work, commuting by car was
associated with greater risk of myocardial infarction,24 and
this relationship was to a large extent explained by inflam-
matory and hemostatic biomarkers.25 We extend these
findings by providing evidence that commuting to work by
bicycle is prospectively associated with lower risk of incident
(and more favorable levels of) risk factors for cardiovascular
diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 We are unaware of any long-term randomized controlled
trial examining the effect of commuter cycling with other
forms of transport on cardiovascular risk factors. However, a
short-term (8-week) randomized trial showed that starting
cycling to school significantly lowered a composite cardio-
vascular risk factor score among 43 12-year-old Danish
children.26 Another short-term randomized trial among 48
Danish adults reported that starting cycling to work increased
fitness and lowered adiposity during an 8-week intervention
period.27 These modest-sized short-term randomized trials
support that commuter cycling is an important causal factor
that can be used for primordial prevention of cardiovascular
risk including maintaining or improving cardiorespiratory
fitness. Previous observational studies in adults suggest that
improving cardiorespiratory fitness is related to lower risk of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
and the metabolic syndrome.28,29
There are some limitations to the study. We were not able to
quantify the contribution of bicycling to work to the total
physical activity level, and we did not have detailed information
on the intensity of bicycling to work, which would provide
additional possibilities to better characterize the possible dose-
dependent relationship with cardiovascular risk. Although we
were able to adjust for many important confounding factors
including educational status and lifestyle factors such as diet,
smoking, alcohol intake, and other physical activity, residual
and unknown confounding may still be an issue. We observed
little heterogeneity of relationships by categories of major
confounders, which reassures us that residual confounding by
these measured confounders is less likely. Finally, obesity was
defined according to BMI and because bicycling is likely to
increase lower extremity muscle mass, the estimates of
differences between passive travel and bicycling we report
may be underestimated due to differential misclassification.
The major strengths of the study were the prospective study
design, the long follow-up period, study populations’ wide
engagement in cycling to work, the large sample size in
conjunction with the availability of a number of important
confounding factors at both time points, careful exclusion of
participants being unemployed or retired and therefore unable
to be exposed, and that we were able to analyze bicycling to
work with some information on dose and study change in
commuting mode. The combination of these analyses provides
us with greater confidence that the estimates of associations
and population impact represent causal relationships.
The study participants were middle-aged adults living in the
County of V€
asterb€
otten in northern Sweden where cycling is
common and its infrastructure politically prioritized. The
findings from our study may not be generalizable to popula-
tions living in areas with a different infrastructure. Neverthe-
less, it was a population-based study and we did not observe
evidence that the benefits of cycling to work differed
according to educational status or sex, which may suggest
wider generalizability of the results.
In conclusion, in a population sample of middle-aged adults
living in northern Sweden, bicycling to work was related to
lower risk of incident obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyc-
eridemia, and IGT compared with passive travel consistent
with a dose–response relationship. Our estimates of the
public health impact of substituting bicycling to work for
passive transport suggest significant cardiovascular risk
factor improvements in this population. Efforts to encourage
population-wide active commuting by bicycle, in addition to
other domains of physical activity, may be an effective
strategy for primordial prevention of cardiovascular disease
and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the general population.
