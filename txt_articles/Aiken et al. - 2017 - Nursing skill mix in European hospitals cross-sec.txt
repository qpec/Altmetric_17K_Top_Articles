ABSTRACT
Objectives To determine the association of
hospital nursing skill mix with patient mortality,
patient ratings of their care and indicators of
quality of care.
Design Cross-sectional patient discharge data,
hospital characteristics and nurse and patient
survey data were merged and analysed using
generalised estimating equations (GEE) and
logistic regression models.
Setting Adult acute care hospitals in Belgium,
England, Finland, Ireland, Spain and Switzerland.
Participants Survey data were collected from
13 077 nurses in 243 hospitals, and 18 828
patients in 182 of the same hospitals in the six
countries. Discharge data were obtained for
275 519 surgical patients in 188 of these
hospitals.
Main outcome measures Patient mortality,
patient ratings of care, care quality, patient safety,
adverse events and nurse burnout and job
dissatisfaction.
Results Richer nurse skill mix (eg, every 10-point
increase in the percentage of professional nurses
among all nursing personnel) was associated with
lower odds of mortality (OR=0.89), lower odds of
low hospital ratings from patients (OR=0.90) and
lower odds of reports of poor quality (OR=0.89),
poor safety grades (OR=0.85) and other poor
outcomes (0.80<OR<0.93), after adjusting for
patient and hospital factors. Each 10 percentage
point reduction in the proportion of professional
nurses is associated with an 11% increase in the
odds of death. In our hospital sample, there were
an average of six caregivers for every 25 patients,
four of whom were professional nurses.
Substituting one nurse assistant for a professional
nurse for every 25 patients is associated with a
21% increase in the odds of dying.
Conclusions A bedside care workforce with a
greater proportion of professional nurses is
associated with better outcomes for patients and
nurses. Reducing nursing skill mix by adding
nursing associates and other categories of
assistive nursing personnel without professional
nurse qualifications may contribute to
preventable deaths, erode quality and safety of
hospital care and contribute to hospital nurse
shortages.
INTRODUCTION
Ensuring good patient outcomes in hospi-
tals is increasingly challenging as national
economic concerns, austerity spending
and health system reforms converge to
create hard choices in resource alloca-
tion.1–3 At its core, hospital care is labour
intensive. Health reforms have made it
more so by reducing hospital length of
stay and diverting discretionary admis-
sions to outpatient settings, such that the
remaining inpatients have more complex
care needs. Medical advances and new
technologies have been more likely to
increase hospital nurse staffing require-
ments
than
to
decrease
them.4
The
growing use of intensive care beds where
professional nurse staffing is highest is
but one example.
Yet the notion persists in policy and
management
discussions
that
hospitals
should be able to transition to a lower
complement of high skilled workers like
professional nurses to reduce costs fol-
lowing examples in other sectors of the
economy.5 6 The premise is that fewer

skilled/higher

 lower wage assistants would result in lower costs of
care without adversely affecting patient outcomes,
although evidence to support such contentions is
lacking. Political leaders in England have recently
introduced a category of hospital caregiver called
‘nursing associate’, akin to the enrolled nurse position
which was phased out in the 1990s.7 8 Notably, this
proposal in England for a less educated caregiver
(18 months of on-the-job training is proposed) has
been made in the context of concern about poor
quality of hospital care,9 10 and nursing skill mix in
National
Health
Service
(NHS)
hospitals
already
being one of the lowest in Europe.11
Policy debates in Europe about hospital skill mix are
happening in a context where evidence is limited and
there is substantial variation in skill mix between and
within countries.3
12–15 Hospital nursing skill mix
varies from a high of 82% professional nurses in
Germany to a low of 57% professional nurses in
England and 54% in Spain.16 Variation in hospital
nurse skill mix within countries is great as illustrated
in NHS hospitals in England where nursing skill mix
varies from a high of 79% professional nurses in
some hospitals to a low of 47% in others.17
The quality of evidence about the outcomes of
nursing skill mix in Europe is very limited as noted in a
Cochrane Collaboration systematic review.4 18 Jarman
et al19 research of English hospitals 15 years ago,
remaining one of the few multihospital studies of the
outcomes of nursing skill mix in Europe, found that
higher proportions of auxiliary nurses (nurse assistants
with limited training) were associated with higher hos-
pital mortality. Similarly, a more recent study of NHS
hospitals confirmed that more healthcare support
workers (ie, nurse assistants) were associated with
higher mortality.20 Most research on nursing skill mix
has been of the US hospitals, where applicability to the
European context is unknown.21–24 The US studies
have generally concluded that a hospital skill mix with
proportionately more professional nurses yields greater
value because higher wages of professional nurses are
offset by reductions in length of stay, lower use of
intensive care, fewer costly adverse events such as
hospital-acquired infections and lower readmission
rates.25–29 Needleman et al estimated that holding con-
stant the total number of hours of nursing care pro-
vided, replacing lower qualified licensed practical
nurses with fewer years of education with professional
nurses would result in lower hospital mortality, shorter
length of stay, fewer complications and net savings.30
The aim of this paper is to inform managerial and
policy decision-making about hospital nursing skill
mix in Europe through an analysis of the association
between nursing skill mix and patient mortality,
patient ratings of their care and quality of care indica-
tors in hospitals in six European countries: Belgium,
England, Finland, Ireland, Spain and Switzerland. W

mix and factors associated with professional nurse
retention in hospital bedside care, important in view
of evidence of present and future hospital nurse
shortages in Europe.31 Our study adds substantially to
the empirical evidence by its multicountry focus and
the use of analytic strategies to disentangle nursing
skill mix from total staffing—a limitation of previous
research. Moreover, for the first time, we evaluate
nursing skill mix while taking account of the educa-
tional qualifications of professional nurses, and in the
context of the quality of hospital work environments
that
potentially
enhance
or
undermine
nurse
productivity.32
DATA AND METHODS
Data include patient discharge data by hospital, hos-
pital administrative information and nurse and patient
surveys from the six countries in the RN4CAST study
that had data from all four sources—Belgium, England,
Finland, Ireland, Spain and Switzerland. This is the
largest data-based study of its kind. For analyses of
nurse-reported outcomes, data were from 13 077
nurses in a representative sample of 243 hospitals
across the six countries. For analyses of patient mortal-
ity, data were from a subset of 188 of the 243 hospitals
(77%) for which detailed individual-level patient out-
comes were available and included 275 519 surgical
patients. The analysis of patient ratings of care
included a subset of 182 of the 243 hospitals (75%) in
which 18 828 patients were surveyed.
Detailed accounts of the design of the 12-country
RN4CAST study,
the
sampling
of
hospitals,
the
surveys of patients and nurses and the assembly of the
surgical patient discharge records have been provided
in prior reports.11 33 34 The most salient features of
the design and methods as they pertain to the six
countries included in the present analysis are repeated
here.
Hospital, nurse and patient samples
Representative samples of at least 30 general acute
care hospitals with at least 100 beds in each country
were selected for the nurse surveys, which were con-
ducted
in 2009–2010. The number of hospitals
ranged from all 30 hospitals in Ireland to 67 in
Belgium. Medical and surgical wards were randomly
sampled in each hospital and all professional nurses
providing direct patient care in these wards were sur-
veyed. In Belgium, Finland and Switzerland, patients
in the same hospitals and on the same wards as the
nurses were also surveyed, and in Ireland and Spain
patients were surveyed from subsets of the hospitals in
which nurses were surveyed. In England, all adult
patients discharged from study hospitals between June
and August 2010 were surveyed. In five of the six
countries—all except England—the patient survey
instrument used was the US Agency for Healthcare

(HCAHPS) survey.35 Patient surveys were undertaken
between 2009 and 2010, and involved a 1-day census
of patients on study units in each hospital that were
able to participate and who understood one of the
eight questionnaire languages available. In England,
we analysed data from study hospitals using the 2010
NHS Adult Inpatient Survey.36 Nurse response rates
in the six European countries averaged 58%, and the
response rates for patients averaged 51%.
Mortality data are for postoperative patients dis-
charged from study hospitals in the year most proxim-
ate to the nurse survey, which ranged across countries
from 2007 to 2009.33 W
e included all patients dis-
charged from the study hospitals 50 years of age and
older who stayed in the hospital for at least 2 days
and underwent common general, orthopaedic or vas-
cular surgery, and for whom complete data were avail-
able on comorbidities present on admission, surgery
type, discharge status and other variables used for risk
adjustment.
Common
surgeries
and
comorbidities
were defined following procedures published previ-
ously.22 37 38 Data were coded in all countries follow-
ing a standard protocol using variants of the 9th or
10th version of the International Classification of
Diseases.39
Patient involvement
Patients were not participants in the initial design of
the overall study but were active participants in the
development of measures of patients’ experiences
with care used in the study. In developing the
HCAHPS survey, AHRQ conducted patient inter-
views, patient focus groups, patient testing of items
and
numerous
small-scale
field
tests.40
Further,
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services41 offered
three opportunities for public comment on HCAHPS
and responded to over 1000 comments before finalis-
ing the instrument used in 5 of 6 countries in this
study. The Picker Institute, developers of the NHS
Adult Inpatient Survey used by this study in England,
employed patient focus groups and cognitive inter-
views with patients during pilot testing. Patients were
offered one page to describe what they thought of the
inpatient questionnaire and which aspects of patient
care were most important to them. The qualitative
research did not identify major questions missing
from the survey but it did lead to minor modifications
that were incorporated.42
W
e further engaged patients in Europe to ensure
that the HCAHPS survey was understandable by
patients in their native languages and included aspects
of patient care that were most important to them.
Each country team recruited 7–12 patients who had
experienced a hospital admission within the year to
rate the HCAHPS questions; a total of 68 patients

Primary measures
Hospital nurse characteristics
W
e
used
four
different
measures
of
the
nurse
characteristics of study hospitals, each of which were
derived by aggregating nurse responses to survey ques-
tions to the hospital level. Staffing measures were cal-
culated for day shift only because of substantial
variation in night staffing. Nursing skill mix was calcu-
lated for each hospital by dividing the number of pro-
fessional nurses by the number of direct care nursing
personnel of all qualifications that each nurse reported
were present on their unit on their last shift, and aver-
aging those ratios across all nurse respondents in each
hospital. Higher ratios indicate a richer skill mix.
Professional nurses in Europe meet minimum stan-
dards published by the European Commission includ-
ing at least 10 years of general education at the
secondary level plus 3 years of nursing education that
can be in a vocational setting or university. The
primary
differentiation
of
professional
nurses
in
Europe is whether they have bachelor’s qualifications
or not. Training requirements and regulations govern-
ing nurse assistants vary widely across hospitals in
Europe and our measure does not differentiate nurse
assistants by the specifics of their qualifications.44–45
Total staffing was calculated by dividing the total
number of nursing personnel (including professional
nurses and others) by the number of patients that each
nurse reported were present on their unit on their last
shift, and averaging those ratios across all nurse
respondents in each hospital. These averages were
then multiplied by 25, the average number of patients
per unit, so the resulting numbers indicate how many
staff were present for every 25 patients across each
hospital. Higher ratios indicate more favourable staff-
ing. Nurse education was the percentage of all profes-
sional nurses in each hospital reporting they had a
bachelor’s degree. The nurse work environment in
each
hospital
was
measured
using
the
Practice
Environment
Scale
of
the
Nursing
W
ork
Index
(PES-NWI), an internationally validated measure.46 47
The PES-NWI measures modifiable organisational
behaviours that comprise five subscales indicating: (1)
managerial support for nursing, (2) nurse participa-
tion in hospital affairs, (3) doctor-nurse relations, (4)
promotion
of
care

and
(5)

and

 items comprising the first four subscales. The staffing
and resource adequacy subscale was dropped because
of its high correlation with the direct measures of
nurse staffing included in the analytic models as in
previous studies.32
Our estimates of nursing skill mix and total staffing
in the different hospitals involve estimates from
nurses working different shifts on different units on
different days. Thus, it is not possible with our data to
determine the consistency between nurses on the
same shift on the same unit in the same hospital on
the same day. But with reasonably large numbers and
in many cases very large numbers of nurses in all of
our study hospitals, we are confident that when we
will aggregate these numbers across nurses to the hos-
pital level we will get reasonable estimates of skill mix
and total staffing.
Other hospital characteristics
In
analyses
of
both
patient
outcomes
and
nurse-reported outcomes we controlled for hospital
size, technology and teaching status. Hospital size was
the number of beds. T
eaching status distinguished hos-
pitals that were non-teaching (no medical residents or
fellows) and teaching hospitals (which had residents
or fellows). High technology hospitals had facilities
for open-heart surgery, major organ transplants or
both. Dummy variables account for unmeasured dif-
ferences across countries.
Patient mortality
Patient
discharge
records
allow
us
to
determine
whether patients died in the hospital within 30 days
of admission. In our analyses of the associations
between hospital nursing characteristics and the likeli-
hood of dying, we risk adjust those likelihoods by
controlling for patient age, sex, admission type (emer-
gency/elective),
43
dummy
variables
indicating
surgery type and 17 dummy variables indicating
comorbidities
present
on
admission,
which
are
included in the Charlson Comorbidity Index.33 48
Patient ratings
In every country except England, patients were asked
to rate their hospitals on a scale from 0 (worst pos-
sible) to 10 (best possible). In England, patients were
asked whether they would rate the care they received
in their hospital as excellent, very good, good, fair or
poor. W
e classified patients as giving low ratings to
their hospital if, in England, they described their care
as anything less than excellent, or if, in the other
countries, they scored their hospital as 8 or less. This
corresponds to the manner in which patient ratings
are ‘top-coded’ in the HCAHPS survey.35
Nurse-reported outcomes
Nine nurse-reported outcomes were measured by cre-
ating simple dichotomous variables. Low or poor
quality of patient care was assessed as the proportion
the quality of care on their units was fair or poor.
Nurse-assessed quality of care has been shown to be
highly related to independent measures of patient out-
comes such as mortality.49 Quality of care was also
indirectly assessed as the proportion of nurses who
would
recommend
their hospital
to
friends
and
family. Low or poor patient safety grade was assessed
as the proportion of nurses who gave their ward a
poor or fair safety grade. Patient safety culture was
assessed using responses to seven items which, like
patient safety grade, was derived from the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality Hospital Survey on
Patient
Safety
Culture,
and
which
asked
nurses
whether they felt their mistakes were held against
them, whether important patient information is lost
during shift changes and whether the actions of hos-
pital management show that patient safety is a top pri-
ority, among others.50 Poor patient safety culture was
assessed as the proportion of nurses whose responses
to three or more of the seven items indicated unsafe
conditions. W
e assessed nurse-reported adverse events
by calculating the proportions of nurses who reported
that (1) pressure ulcers, (2) falls with injuries and (3)
urinary tract infections occurred occasionally or fre-
quently (combining ‘a few times a month’, ‘once a
week’, ‘a few times a week’ and ‘every day’) rather
than rarely or never (combining categories ‘never’, ‘a
few times a year or less’ and ‘once a month or less’).
Nurse job dissatisfaction was assessed using a single
item which asked nurses how satisfied they were with
their current job. Nurse burnout was measured with
the emotional exhaustion subscale of the Maslach
Burnout Inventory,51 an instrument with established
reliability and validity in international research.52 W
e
assessed these factors as the proportion of dissatisfied
nurses, and the proportion of nurses with high
burnout (scores above 27 on the emotional exhaus-
tion subscale).
Analytic methods
Descriptive information on the variables of interest is
provided, and shows how skill mix, total bedside care-
giver staffing, nurse practice environments and nurse
education vary across different hospitals. The associ-
ation of nursing skill mix is then estimated for patient
mortality, patient ratings of their hospitals and nurse
reports of quality of care, patient safety, adverse
events and nurse burnout and dissatisfaction, before
and after controlling for other hospital characteristics,
patient characteristics (in the mortality analyses) and
nurse characteristics (in the analyses of nurse-reported
outcomes). Other hospital characteristics controlled
included total nursing personnel staffing, nurse educa-
tion and the nurse practice environment, as well as
size, teaching status and technology. Patient character-
istics included age, sex, admission type, surgery type
and
comorbidities
present
on
admission.

 status and unit specialty. Dummy variables represent-
ing the different countries were also included in the
models with controls to allow for unmeasured differ-
ences across countries. Generalised estimating equa-
tions (GEE) were used in analysing mortality and
logistic regression models were used in analysing
patient ratings and nurse-reported outcomes. In both
approaches, we took account of patients being nested
within hospitals. W
e tested for interactions but found
none. W
e also dropped from the models the associ-
ation of the nurse practice environment with mortal-
ity, since it was insignificant, and the association of
nurse
education
with
patient
ratings
and
nurse-reported outcomes, for the same reason. In
online supplementary tables in the appendix, we show
the correlations between nursing characteristics and
other hospital characteristics, and the relationships of
the full set of nursing and hospital characteristics with
the different outcomes.
RESULTS
As noted in table 1, there were 275 519 surgical dis-
charges from the 188 study hospitals for which patient
data were available, an average of 1466 discharges per
hospital. There were 3569 surgical patient deaths—an
average of 19 deaths per hospital during the study
period—yielding an average hospital mortality rate of
12.8 per 1000 discharges. The middle panel of table 1
shows that 18 828 patients were surveyed in 182 hospi-
tals, for an average of just over 100 patient respondents
per hospital. In the average hospital, 54% of the
patients surveyed gave their hospitals low ratings. The
bottom panel shows that 13 077 professional nurses
were surveyed in the 243 study hospitals. The average
hospital had 54 nurse respondents. On average, slightly
more than one in five nurses rated the quality of care
on their hospital unit as poor or fair, and while only an
average of 7% of the nurses across hospitals gave their
hospital a poor or failing safety grade, one-third indi-
cated that their hospital exhibited a poor safety
culture. Nearly one in five nurses would not recom-
mend their hospital to friend or family, and on average
9%
of
the
nurses
reported
that
pressure
ulcers
occurred in their hospitals occasionally or frequently,
and 12% and 23% said the same about falls with
injury and urinary tract infections, respectively. In the
average hospital, almost 30% of nurses scored high on
the burnout scale, and a similar per cent expressed dis-
satisfaction with their job.
Table 2 shows that overall the skill mix, or the per-
centage
of
professional
nurses
among
the
total
nursing personnel in this sample of hospitals, was
roughly 66%, and ranged across hospitals from 41%
to 87%. Total nursing personnel staffing overall was
roughly 6.1 nursing personnel (all qualifications) for
every 25 patients, and ranged from 2.7 per 25
patients in the poorest staffed hospital to 13.8 per 25
patients in the best. Practice environment scores aver-
aged roughly 2.7 across the 188 hospitals—slightly
above the middle of the 4-point scale—and ranged
from 2.1 in the hospital with the worst environment
to 3.4 in the hospital with the best. Nurse education,
or the
percentage
of bachelor’s prepared nurses
among all professional nurses, averaged 47% overall,
and ranged widely from 0% in some hospitals to
100% in others.

nine
different
nurse-reported
outcomes
before and after adjusting for differences across hospi-
tals in patient and nurse characteristics and for other
hospital characteristics of importance (total staffing,
nurse education, the nurse work environment, size,
teaching status and technology) and unmeasured dif-
ferences
across
countries.
Before
adjustment
(or
without controls), hospitals with richer skill mixes
appear to have higher odds on a couple of these 11
outcomes (involving poor safety grades and safety cul-
tures) but lower odds on the others, and for 6 of the
11 outcomes the ORs are insignificant (p>0.05).
While controlling for the various potentially con-
founding characteristics affects the skill mix associ-
ation
with
these
11
outcomes
differently—some
increase, others decrease, and some hardly change at
all—after adjustment hospitals with richer nursing
skill
mixes
have
lower odds
on
all
11
of
the
unfavourable outcomes and the differences are signifi-
cant in every case. Every 10-point increase in the per-
centage of professional nurses among all nursing
personnel diminishes the odds on patients dying by a
factor of 0.89 and diminishes the odds on patients
giving their hospitals low ratings by a factor of 0.90.
And nursing skill mix is similarly related to all nine of
the different nurse-reported outcomes. Net of the
other nursing characteristics, and after taking account
of unmeasured differences between countries and
measured
differences
in
nurse
characteristics
and
other hospital characteristics that might affect nurse
reports, nurses in hospitals with richer skill mixes
have lower odds on reporting poorer quality care,
lower patient safety, high burnout and job dissatisfac-
tion. They also are more likely to recommend their
hospital, less likely to report inadequate safety culture
in their hospital and less likely to report occasional or

Skill mix is the percentage of professional nurses among all nursing personnel in the hospital. Total staffing is the total number of all nursing personnel
(at all qualification levels) for every 25 patients they cared for. The practice environment measure is the average score for each hospital across four
subscales indicating (1) managerial support for nursing, (2) nurse participation in hospital affairs, (3) doctor-nurse relations and (4) promotion of care
quality (where a score of 1 would indicate extremely poor on all subscales, and a score of 4 would indicate excellent on all subscales). Nurse education is
the percentage of all professional nurses in each hospital with bachelor’s degrees.

Inpatient mortality was measured using patient discharge data, hospital rating by patients was measured using patient survey data and the remainder were
measured using nurse survey data. Huber-White Cluster corrections were used to estimate SEs associated with the skill mix coefficients. Skill mix was
measured in units of 10 percentage points. Controls in the mortality models include hospital characteristics (total bedside care staffing, nurse education,
teaching status, high technology and bed size), patient characteristics (age, sex, admission type, 43 dummy variables indicating surgery type and 17
dummy variables indicating comorbidities present on admission) and country. Controls in the models estimating patient ratings included the same hospital
characteristics and country. Controls in the models estimating nurse-reported outcomes included hospital characteristics (total nursing personnel staffing,
nurse practice environment, teaching status, high technology and bed size) nurse characteristics (age, sex, full-time employment status and unit specialty)
and country.

associated with the effect of nursing skill mix on these
different outcomes, which range from 0.80 for report-
ing falls with injury to 0.93 for reporting that their

hospitals that differ by 10% in the proportion of pro-

DISCUSSION
In a context in Europe in which hospital nurse staffing
is a frequent target for budget reductions, and policy
makers are suggesting the introduction of lower
skilled
and
less
educated
nurse
substitutes
like
‘nursing associates’, our results suggest caution is war-
ranted. W
e find a nursing skill mix in hospitals with a
higher proportion of professional nurses is associated
with
significantly
lower
mortality,
higher
patient
ratings of their care and fewer adverse care outcomes.
Specifically, each 10% increase in the proportion of
nursing personnel who are professional nurses is asso-
ciated with an 11% decrease in the odds of patient
deaths after general surgery. Or from the perspective
of reducing skill mix, which is more in vogue among
policy makers, each 10% reduction in the proportion
of professional nurses is associated with a 12%
increase in the odds of patient deaths. W
e note that
the proportion of professional nurses can be altered
by either reducing the number of professional nurses
or adding less skilled workers, both of which have the
same effect on reducing skill mix and risking poor
patient outcomes. Additional research is needed to
establish that an increase in the proportion of profes-
sional nurses will have the aforementioned effect,
since these estimates are inferred from cross-sectional
data which make causal inferences less certain.
Our research suggests that substituting lower quali-
fied personnel for professional nurses may result in an
increase in preventable deaths and other adverse out-
comes for patients. In our representative sample of
European hospitals, there was an average of six
nursing personnel for every 25 patients, four of
whom were professional nurses. The effect of substi-
tuting one nurse assistant for one professional nurse
to care for every 25 patients—thus reducing the skill
mix from 66.7% to 50%, or by 16.7%—would be to
increase the odds on mortality by 21% (or, mathemat-
ically, by a factor of (1/0.89)1.667=1.21). Alternatively,
the effect of substituting one professional nurse for
one nurse assistant to care for every 25 patients—thus
increasing the skill mix from 66.7% to 83.3%, or by
the same 16.7%—would be to decrease the odds on
mortality by 18% (or by a factor of 0.891.667=0.82).
Other adverse outcomes would be similarly affected.
For example, every 10% increase in the percentage of
associated with a 10% reduction in the odds of
patients giving their hospital poor ratings. Total staff-
ing, or the total number of nursing personnel per
patient, was not a significant predictor of how patients
rated their hospitals, only the proportion of profes-
sional nurses.
Our results also showed that nurses in hospitals
with a greater proportion of professional nurses
(higher skill mix) were less likely to rate the quality of
care in their hospital as fair or poor, were less likely
to report poor patient safety culture and less likely to
have misgivings about recommending the hospital to
family members and friends. Additionally nurses in
hospitals with a rich nursing skill mix were less likely
to report common adverse patient events such as falls
with injuries, pressure ulcers and urinary tract infec-
tions. Previous research has established that nurse
reports of quality are significantly associated with
actual patient outcomes.49
Paradoxically, despite policy and managerial interest
in professional nurse substitutes driven by budget con-
straints, there are also concerns about existing and
future shortages of professional nurses in Europe.53
Our results suggest that in hospitals with richer skill
mix, professional nurses are less likely to experience
high job-related burnout—a patient safety hazard and
nurse retention problem—or to be dissatisfied with
their jobs potentially contributing to expensive and
disruptive turnover and nurse shortage at the hospital
bedside.
While this study is the largest and most comprehen-
sive study of the outcomes of hospital nurse skill mix
in Europe to date, some limitations should be noted.
Given our study design, we are able to link nurses and
patients to the same hospitals, but we cannot link spe-
cific nurses and patients, so results must be interpreted
with some caution. The study is cross-sectional offer-
ing a snapshot of associations between hospital staff-
ing and patient outcomes at a single point in time.
Thus, and as noted above, we cannot be sure of causal
links between skill mix and outcomes. W
e did,
however, test and eliminate a number of alternative
explanations for the relationships found between
nursing skill mix and outcomes including variation in
the quality of the work environment, hospital size and
technology availability. A repeat study of the same
hospitals over time, following the same research
protocol,
could
provide
greater
certainty
that
improved skill mix would result in improved patient
outcomes. A common research protocol and survey
instruments were used across countries except in the
measurement of patient ratings of their hospitals
where data from a national survey in England was
used instead of the primary patient survey instrument
used in other countries. To reduce the effects of the
methods resulting from the different instruments, we
used a comparable measure of global patient ratings of

 hospital physician staffing because uniform data across
hospitals in different countries do not exist. However,
in other research physician factors have been asso-
ciated with patient outcomes independently of nurse
staffing, and thus would not likely explain the rela-
tionships between nursing skill mix and patient out-
comes.20 38 The absence of standardised qualifications
for nurse assistants in Europe did not allow us to take
into account the effects of differences in nurse assis-
tants between countries, although we take account of
unmeasured country differences through the use of
‘country’ dummy variables in our predictive models.
Data availability in Europe did not permit a study of
the comparative costs of nurse staff composition. The
better patient outcomes associated in this study with
richer skill mix suggest that, as in the USA where
detailed cost information is available, fewer expensive
complications like infection, shorter length of stay and
fewer intensive care unit days among patients in hos-
pitals with better professional nurse staffing would
likely offset higher labour costs associated with richer
skill mix and return good value to health systems.26
Our results of one of the first comprehensive studies
of nursing skill mix in Europe are similar to results
obtained in studies of nursing skill mix in the USA.
Our four state study in the USA showed 30-day general
surgery mortality rates of 1.2%32 compared with
European in-hospital mortality rates shown here of
1.28%; the US patients studied included all adult
patients aged 20–85 years while the European patients
were aged 50 years and older. The US hospitals have a
higher nursing skill mix than Europe averaging 75%
professional nurses, with hospitals ranging from a low
of 68% to a high of 83% professional nurses. Hospital
nursing skill mix in the European countries studied
here averaged 66% professional nurses, varying from
41% to 87%. Nevertheless, studies in the USA have
reached similar conclusions to what we found in
Europe, that the higher the proportion of professional
nurses the better the outcomes for patients.
CONCLUSIONS
Findings from this large and unique study of nursing
skill mix in European hospitals suggests that caution
should be taken in implementing policies to reduce
hospital nursing skill mix because the consequences
can be life threatening for patients. Beyond risking
preventable death among hospitalised patients, the
erosion of nursing skill mix could negatively impact
overall quality and safety of care as well as patients’
perceptions of the adequacy of their hospitals at a
time when there are growing concerns about eroding
hospital care quality.9
10 Indeed, in this study we
found that half of the almost 19 000 patients surveyed
failed to rate their hospitals as excellent. For hospital
managers and policymakers looking for evidence of
how to get the most value for investments in hospital
the proportion of professional nurses as well as redu-
cing disparities in nursing skill mix between hospitals
within countries. Our study adds new and important
evidence that diluting hospital nurse skill mix by
adding lower skilled nurse assistants and/or reducing
professional nurses is not in the public interest.
