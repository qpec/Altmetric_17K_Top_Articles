A Breakthrough: Macrophage-Directed Cancer
Immunotherapy
Charles D. Mills1, Laurel L. Lenz2, and Robert A. Harris3
Abstract
Successful immunotherapy of cancer is becoming a reality
aided by the realization that macrophages play an important role
in the growth or regression of tumors. Specifically, M2/repair-type
macrophages predominate in human cancers and produce
growth-promoting molecules that actively stimulate tumor
growth in much the same way they help wounds heal. However,
modulating M2/repair-type macrophages to M1/kill-type can
slow or stop cancer growth. The effects involve direct activity of
M1 kill-type as well as the ability of M1-type macrophages to
stimulate Th1-type cytotoxic T cells and other effector cells.
Macrophage responses can also predict cancer susceptibility;
individuals with a high M1/kill to M2/repair ratio are less prone.
That macrophages/innate immunity can be modulated to play a
central role in directly or indirectly combating cancer is a break-
through that seems likely to finally make successful immunother-
apy of cancer a reality. Cancer Res; 76(3); 513–6. �2016 AACR.
Background to Cancer Immunology
Cancer is the most dreaded disease of modern man. Despite
billions of dollars spent on finding "cures," cancer kills people
at about the same rate it did 50 years ago. The immune system
has long been thought to have the potential to slow cancer.
Virchow is widely credited with first describing "white" cells in
tumors, which he called lymphoreticular cells (1), sometimes
comprising >50% of the tumor mass. Metchnikoff named such
cells "Big Eaters" (macrophages) because he observed them
engulfing dead cells or pathogens. However, the role of macro-
phages in tumors was mostly overlooked while investigators
tried to identify tumor-specific anticancer responses and to
create specific "cancer vaccines." Paul Erhlich was an early
proponent of this idea around the turn of the 20th century
(1, 2). He and others noticed that cancers could not be trans-
planted between individuals, suggesting "foreignness" such as
that with pathogens. However, it was soon realized that normal
cells or organs could also not be transplanted: there were
"allogeneic" differences between individuals that stimulate
strong rejection responses by the immune system.
Nonetheless, the concept that cancer was "foreign" continued
to be enticing to immunologists because of the spectacular
successes of specific vaccines against disease scourges, such as
smallpox and polio. Dr. William B. Coley and a few others
obtained some successes against human cancer in the early 20th
century by injecting mixtures of bacteria called "Coley's Toxin"
(3). However, why this occurred was not clear, and the treatments
were dangerous and mostly abandoned. Knowledge of the role of
the immune system in cancer was hindered by the fact that tumors
died with their hosts. The development of inbred mice and tissue
culture techniques were major advances because they allowed
tumors to be serially transplanted between individuals or main-
tained in the laboratory for study. Tumors were identified in mice
that have antigens recognized by tumor-specific T cells, and that
could be specifically rejected with "cancer vaccines" (4). In addi-
tion, bolstering hope for specific cancer vaccines was the observa-
tions of viruses in cancers, which, if common, could provide a
target against which specific T cells or antibodies could be directed
(5). Optimism remained high that cancer vaccines would be the
next great immunologic triumph.
However, subsequent difficulties in identifying tumor-specific
antigens recognized by the immune system in most human
cancers stimulated investigators to take a fresh look at how
anticancer immune defenses might be boosted. The answer was
hiding in plain site. It was the leukocyte long known to predom-
inate in cancer: the macrophage (1, 6).
Observations Trump Optimism in Cancer
Immunology
Amidst optimism about specific cancer vaccines were four key
observations suggesting that the relationship between the
immune system and cancer was not at all as envisaged.
First, there is little or no evolutionary pressure for humans to
develop anticancer defenses. Animals succeed/advance mainly by
breeding, which enables the retention of desirable, heritable
qualities.
Because most cancer occurs after breeding age has been
attained, its absence is not an evolutionary survival advantage
(6). Second, in the 1970s, it was observed that mice deficient in T
cells did not exhibit overall increases in the incidence of cancer
(7). Third, it was demonstrated that immune responses could
stimulate tumor growth (8). Fourth, though many researchers
studied "immunogenic" tumors in mice, most spontaneous
murine tumors did not possess tumor-specific antigens. Similarly,
because few human tumors expressed recognizable tumor-spe-
cific antigens, attempts by the NCI and others to stimulate
specific "killer" lymphocytes in vitro or in vivo against patients'

 cancers have only been successful with certain tumors such as
melanoma (9).
In a related vein, genomic technologies have provided new
optimism that unique mutations will be identified in cancer that
may allow personalized cancer treatments with drugs or through
boosting the immune system. However, so far few targetable
differences in cancer have been observed, and the expense
involved in this approach is likely to be prohibitive for the general
population.
The foregoing observations suggest that tumor-specific anti-
gens on human tumors are rare, and/or there is something
unknown about the immune system that prevents immuno-
logic responses from occurring that could inhibit cancer
growth. Current evidence suggests that both these conclusions
are true. Here, we will focus on new observations that tumor
growth–promoting macrophages predominate in cancer but
can be modulated into tumor growth–inhibiting macrophages,
resulting in successful cancer immunotherapy.
Macrophages Predominate in Cancers and
Wounds and Promote Growth
Investigations into the activity of macrophages in sterile
wounds and developing tumors revealed important similarities.
In both circumstances, the macrophages present produce a large
quantity of the growth-promoting molecule ornithine (a precur-
sor of polyamines required for cell proliferation; refs. 10, 11;
reviewed in ref. 12). Although macrophages had been shown in
the 1960s to be "activated" by T cells in vivo and to be necessary for
defense against many bacteria (13), macrophages in either sterile
wounds or growing tumors did not exhibit killing activity
(10, 11). At this time, it was unclear how macrophages killed
pathogens. In the late 1980s, John Hibbs and colleagues discov-
ered that macrophages kill pathogens and cancer cells through the
production of nitric oxide (NO; ref. 14). Fascinatingly, macro-
phages produce both growth-inhibiting NO and growth-promot-
ing ornithine via the enzymatic conversion of arginine through
inducible nitric oxide synthase or arginase, respectively (6, 15). In
contrast with a growing tumor, macrophages inside a tumor being
rejected produced prodigious quantities of NO (11). These sem-
inal observations provided the biochemical explanation for the
unique ability of macrophages to kill or repair, depending on the
circumstance (reviewed in 12). Macrophage populations that
inhibit growth or kill are now called M1-type, and those that
promote growth and repair are called M2-type (16). Most relevant
to cancer, the results demonstrated that macrophages inside
growing tumors actively promote growth: findings roundly ver-
ified in human tumors (12, 17, 18). Tumor-associated macro-
phages have since been demonstrated to produce other growth-
promoting molecules in addition to ornithine, including VEGF,
EGF, and TGFb as illustrated in Fig. 1A (12).
Direct Macrophage/Innate Effects on
Cancer
As discussed above, most cancers are primarily populated by
M2/repair-type macrophages, but if instead M1/kill activity is
enhanced, locally tumor inhibition is observed (11, 18, 19).

macrophages promote growth and

intercellular matrices. B, macrophage-

 Because many cancers do not display distinct tumor antigens,
both the growth promotion and the growth inhibition occur via
"innate" mechanisms (11, 20). Macrophage tumor growth pro-
motion can occur because the tumor environment provides
signals that inhibit M1/kill-type activation, such as PGE2 or TGFb
(17, 18). Although such signals are believed to be important in
suppressing macrophages, M1/kill-type activity may also not be
stimulated because of the absence of "toll"-like or specific tumor
antigens as in a sterile wound (10). The tumor environment or the
lack of activating stimuli also seems to play a role in limiting the
activation of other innate responses, such as natural killer cells
that can kill tumor cells directly, or augment M1/kill-type acti-
vation through IFNg production (20).
Whereas this intratumor circumstance may seem foreboding,
recent evidence indicates that M2/repair-type macrophages can
be modulated to M1/kill-type, and such activation is sufficient
on its own to cause tumor rejection (11, 19, 20). The impor-
tance of direct macrophage activity in cancer outcomes is
supported by observations that animals with M1/kill-dominant
responses (e.g., C57Bl/6) exhibit a decreased tumor incidence
when compared with M2/repair-dominant mice (e.g., Balb/c;
refs. 12, 16, 21). Lower animals such as invertebrates (without T
or B cells) also exhibit low cancer incidences, which is consis-
tent with an important role of macrophages/innate immunity
in inhibiting tumor appearance or growth (22–24). Figure 1B
illustrates how macrophage innate conversion therapy to M1/
kill responses (or MIC1) can result in tumor regression. As will
be evident in the following section, new knowledge indicates
that proper modulation of intratumor macrophages is also
necessary to direct T or B cells toward tumoricidal responses
that can occur whether or not tumor-specific antigens are
present.
Macrophages/Innate Immunity Indirectly
Influences Cancer and Other Immune
Responses
In addition to their direct tumor-promoting activity discussed
above, other key discoveries about macrophages have indicated
that their influence on immune responses to cancer and other
diseases is much greater than was previously thought. In partic-
ular, it became known in the 1970s that macrophages are neces-
sary to present antigens to T cells (25). Toll and other receptors
were then identified on macrophages, indicating that they can
directly and specifically recognize pathogens (26)—something T
cells are unable to do. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that the
respective polar-opposite macrophage M1/NO/kill and the M2/
ornithine/repair responses both occurred in mice devoid of T cells
(16), which importantly established the independence of innate
from adaptive immunity. As mentioned, some animals (e.g.,
C57Bl/6 mice) exhibit M1/kill-dominant macrophage responses
associated with lower cancer incidence, whereas others (e.g.,
Balb/c) are M2/repair dominant. Perhaps most pertinent to
anticancer responses, it was also discovered that M1-dominant
macrophages stimulated na€
�ve T cells to make a Th1/cytotoxic
response, whereas those exhibiting M2-dominant responses stim-
ulated a Th2-type response associated with antibody production
(16). This was the reason macrophages were specifically termed
M1 and M2. Some prefer the term "dendritic cells" for myeloid-
derived cells that direct T-cell responses. However, the most
salient point is that either leukocyte can direct T- and B-cell
responses, so here we will use the term "macrophage" for both
and leave that debate to others (27).
Regardless of the terminology, an important and promising
new observation for cancer immunotherapy (as well as immu-
nology in general) is that macrophages not only direct T- or B-cell
responses, but can also do so in the presence or absence of specific
antigens. In particular, M2-type macrophages, through innate
signals such as TGFb and IL10, induce T cells into Treg and other
T-cell type responses without anticancer activity (16, 18). In
contrast, M1-type macrophages activate Th1-type responses that
can further amplify M1/killer-type activity through the produc-
tion of IFNg (12). Such Th1-type activity can inhibit cancer
because macrophage-derived NO is nonspecific in its killing
activity once generated (14, 28). In addition, if specific tumor
antigens are present, macrophage-directed adaptive immunity
can result in the stimulation of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells.
This macrophage adaptive conversion therapy, or MAC1 (Fig.
1C), has the additional advantage that cytotoxic T cells recognize
and kill tumor cells directly, preventing collateral damage by
macrophage killing, and also protective T- or B-cell memory can
be engendered (12).
Thus, the realization that macrophages/innate immunity plays
pivotal roles in directing cancer outcomes, either directly or by
nonspecifically influencing T- and B-cell functions, in addition to
the potential to activate specific anticancer defenses (if suitable
antigens are present), is opening up new approaches to cancer
immunotherapy.
The Bright Future of Macrophage-Directed
Therapy for Eliminating Cancer
Evidence reviewed herein indicates that modulating macro-
phage responses is a breakthrough that will facilitate successful
immunotherapy. There are still hurdles to overcome. For example,
earlier attempts at stimulating macrophages/innate immunity
(typified by "Coley's Toxin") were accompanied by dangerous
side effects (3) that have also been observed in more recent
attempts at immunotherapy (9). However, an increased under-
standing of the mediators involved in such side effects and an
armamentarium of new drugs should allow the positive effects of
elevating M1/kill and other anticancer innate responses to be
manifest while minimizing undesirable effects. Although increas-
ing M1/kill responses through macrophage-innate or adaptive
conversion therapy (MIC1 or MAC1) is beneficial against cancer,
it is also recognized now that overzealous M1/kill–Th1 cytotoxic
responses contribute to (or cause) atherosclerosis and other
chronic inflammatory conditions (6, 12, 29). Therefore, in cancer
and in other conditions, it will be important to be mindful of the
powerful two-edged nature of macrophage responses for optimal
results.
The biggest triumphs of immunology to date have been against
infectious diseases. An exciting new chapter is beginning. Mac-
rophage-based immunotherapy will help ameliorate cancer and
other diseases via more natural, effective and less-toxic and
disabling means than chemotherapy, drugs, or surgery.
