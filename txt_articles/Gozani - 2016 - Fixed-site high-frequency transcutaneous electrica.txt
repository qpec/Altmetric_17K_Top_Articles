Fixed-site high-frequency transcutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation for treatment of 
chronic low back and lower extremity pain
Shai N Gozani
NeuroMetrix, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA
Objective: The objective of this study was to determine if fixed-site high-frequency transcu-
taneous electrical nerve stimulation (FS-TENS) is effective in treating chronic low back and 
lower extremity pain.
Background: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is widely used for treatment of 
chronic pain. General-purpose transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation devices are designed 
for stimulation anywhere on the body and often cannot be used while the user is active or sleep-
ing. FS-TENS devices are designed for placement at a pre-determined location, which enables 
development of a wearable device for use over extended time periods.
Methods: Study participants with chronic low back and/or lower extremity pain self-adminis-
tered an FS-TENS device for 60 days. Baseline, 30-, and 60-day follow-up data were obtained 
through an online questionnaire. The primary outcome measure was the patient global impression 
of change. Pain intensity and interference were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory. Changes 
in use of concomitant pain medications were evaluated with a single-item global self-rating.
Results: One hundred and thirty participants were enrolled, with 88 completing the 60-day 
follow-up questionnaire. Most participants (73.9%) were 50 years of age or older. At baseline, 
low back pain was identified by 85.3%, lower extremity pain by 71.6%, and upper extremity 
pain by 62.5%. Participants reported widespread pain, at baseline, with a mean of 3.4 (standard 
deviation 1.1) pain sites. At the 60-day follow-up, 80.7% of participants reported that their 
chronic pain had improved and they were classified as responders. Baseline characteristics did 
not differentiate non-responders from responders. There were numerical trends toward reduced 
pain interference with walking ability and sleep, and greater pain relief in responders. There was 
a large difference in use of concomitant pain medications, with 80.3% of responders reporting 
a reduction compared to 11.8% of non-responders.
Conclusion: FS-TENS is a safe and effective option for treating chronic low back and lower 
extremity pain. These results motivate the use of FS-TENS in development of wearable anal-
gesic devices.
Keywords: chronic pain, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, wearable, patient global 
impression of change
Introduction
The Functioning and Disability Supplement of the 2012 National Health Interview 
Survey estimated that 40 million US adults have pain every day or most days, and 
another 87 million have pain on some days.1 Many people with chronic pain also have 
low quality sleep, anxiety, depression, and poor overall health.2 The annual economic 
cost of chronic pain is US $600 billion in the US alone.3 The past few decades have 
seen a dramatic increase in use of prescription opioids for chronic pain despite  
concerns

about their adverse effects and potential for addiction.4 
Therefore, there is a need for non-pharmacological options 
for treatment of chronic pain.
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is 
the delivery of electricity across the intact surface of the 
skin to activate sensory nerve fibers. The technology was 
originally developed as a screening technique for predicting 
which chronic pain patients would respond to implantable 
stimulators. However, it became apparent that a significant 
percentage attained pain relief from TENS alone. Since that 
time, the efficacy of TENS for the treatment of chronic pain 
has been studied extensively. When evaluated with proper 
attention to methodological and technical factors,5 TENS 
has generally been shown to be safe and effective in various 
forms of chronic pain.6-11 
A conceptual model for how sensory nerve stimulation 
leads to pain relief was proposed by Melzack and Wall in 
1965.12 Their theory stipulates that activation of sensory 
nerves (Aβ fibers) closes a “pain gate” in the spinal cord that 
inhibits the transmission of pain signals carried by nocicep-
tive afferents (C and Aδ fibers) to the brain. In the past 20 
years, anatomic pathways and molecular mechanisms that 
may underlie the pain gate have been identified. Sensory 
nerve stimulation activates the descending pain inhibition 
system, primarily the periaqueductal gray and rostroventral 
medial medulla located in the midbrain and medulla sections 
of the brainstem respectively.13 The periaqueductal gray 
has neural projections to the rostroventral medial medulla, 
which in turn has diffuse bilateral projections into the spi-
nal cord dorsal horn14,15 that inhibit ascending pain signal 
transmission.13-15 
General purpose TENS (GP-TENS) devices are designed 
to enable stimulation essentially anywhere on the body under 
the assumption that analgesia is limited to the vicinity of the 
electrodes. However, activation of descending inhibition leads 
to analgesia beyond the stimulation site.16-20 This suggests an 
alternative approach, fixed-site high-frequency TENS (FS-
TENS), in which the device is designed for a pre-determined 
location rather than according to the patient’s pain distribu-
tion. A priori knowledge of the anatomy and neurophysiology 
of a target site enables development of wearable devices that 
can be used for extended time without disrupting daytime 
activity or sleep, which is not feasible with GP-TENS. For 
example, the mechanical design of the device can be opti-
mized for the specific anatomical location. Similarly, the 
electrode dimensions and electrical specifications can be 
matched to the peripheral nerves to be stimulated. An emerg-
ing benefit of FS-TENS is integration of wearable technology 
such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and thermosensors.21 
These measurements can provide objective feedback for 
therapy optimization, potentially in real-time. For example, 
accelerometer readings from the leg may be combined with a 
lower extremity biomechanical model to quantitatively track 
activity, falls, gait, and sleep, which are all influenced by 
chronic pain.22-25 Finally, FS-TENS can better co-exist with 
other devices, such as pacemakers,26 that may be disturbed 
by nearby electrical stimulation.
This study evaluated the efficacy of an FS-TENS device, 
placed on the upper calf, for chronic low back and lower 
extremity pain. The first study aim was to determine whether 
this FS-TENS device was effective in providing pain relief. 
The second aim was to identify baseline factors predictive of 
a positive response. The relationship between the anatomic 
distribution of pain and the response to FS-TENS was of 
particular interest. The third aim was to identify which 
chronic pain domains were most influenced by FS-TENS. 
The implications of this study are that if FS-TENS is safe 
and effective, then opportunities exist for development of 
wearable analgesic devices for treating chronic pain.
Methods
Participants
Study participants were recruited from a cohort of 300 
chronic pain sufferers who participated in an online research 
project to evaluate attitudes about alternative approaches to 
pain management. Inclusion criteria for the original cohort 
were primary residence in the US, age 40 years or more, 
minimum household income of US $50,000, pain for most 
days during the past 3 months or longer, pain distribution 
that included one or more sites in the low back, legs or feet, 
and at least one painful health condition among diabetes, 
sciatica, fibromyalgia, neuropathy, shingles, and restless 
leg syndrome. The last condition was included because the 
sensory symptoms are often described as painful27,28 and 
because of its high association with neuropathies,29 fibromy-
algia,30 and multi-site chronic pain.31 Exclusion criteria were 
any contraindication to use of the FS-TENS device, which 
included having a cardiac pacemaker, implanted defibrillator, 
or other implanted metallic or electronic device. Participants 
received US $50 compensation and the option to keep the 
FS-TENS device upon completing the study.
Procedures and outcome variables
Recruitment and data collection was managed by an indepen-
dent research firm. Enrolled participants completed an online 
baseline questionnaire and were then sent a commercially

Fixed-site high-frequency TENS for treatment of chronic pain
available, over-the-counter (OTC), FS-TENS device. They 
had access to the same instructional resources as commercial 
users. The device instructions encourage daily use to man-
age pain. Participants did not receive special instructions or 
training. Participants self-administered the device for 60 days. 
At 30 and 60 days following delivery of the device, follow-up 
data were obtained through an online questionnaire that took 
about 10 minutes to complete. Participants had 1 week to 
complete the questionnaires, and up to two reminder emails 
were sent. If the questionnaire was not completed within 
the 1-week period then the participant was deemed lost to 
follow-up. De-referenced data files were provided to the 
study author. All participants signed digital informed consent. 
Institutional review board approval was not sought because 
the study was conducted using a commercially available OTC 
device consistent with its US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) cleared instructions and participant involvement was 
limited to voluntarily completing three online surveys. The 
principles outlined in the World Medical Association Decla-
ration of Helsinki - Ethical Principles for Medical Research 
Involving Human Subjects, were followed.32
The baseline variables included demographics, pain 
characteristics, and use of pain medications. Pain was char-
acterized by duration, anatomical distribution, painful health 
conditions, and a prospectively selected subset of the Brief 
Pain Inventory – Short Form (BPI-SF).33 The anatomical 
distribution was defined as one or more among nine sites that 
included feet, legs, lower back, chest, hands, arms, abdomen, 
neck, and head. Lower extremity sites included feet and legs; 
upper extremity sites included arms, hands, and neck. The 
location of the pain was not qualified as unilateral or bilateral 
because of the potential for contralateral secondary hyper-
algesia and allodynia.34 Painful health conditions included 
arthritis, diabetes, sciatica, neuropathy, fibromyalgia, restless 
leg syndrome, shingles, cancer, and accident/injury. Car-
diovascular risk factors were recorded because of their high 
prevalence in chronic pain,35,36 but were not treated as painful 
conditions. BPI-SF items included average and worst pain; 
interference with sleep, general activity, walking ability, and 
mood; and pain relief. This final item asks participants to rate 
the percentage relief they feel their current pain treatments 
provide (0% for no pain relief to 100% for complete pain 
relief). This item represents pain treatment satisfaction.33
Follow-up data include patient global impression of 
change (PGIC), the aforementioned BPI-SF items, use of 
concomitant pain medications, and self-reported device 
utilization. The primary outcome measure was the PGIC. 
Participants were asked to rate changes in their chronic pain 
and overall health since the beginning of the study using a 
5-point scale comprised of: much worse, worse, no change, 
improved, or much improved. Responders were participants 
with a rating of improved or much improved. Participants 
reported changes in use of concomitant pain medications with 
a single-item global self-rating comprised of: decreased a lot, 
decreased a little, no change, increased a little, or increased 
a lot. Device utilization was self-reported as: several times a 
day, once or twice every day, several times a week, or several 
times a month.
FS-TENS device
All participants used the same FDA cleared OTC FS-TENS 
device (Quell®; NeuroMetrix Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). 
This device is comprised of a one-channel stimulator, a 
stretchable band to secure the stimulator to the upper calf, 
and an electrode (Figure 1). The electrode is an array of four 
hydrogel pads, connected in two pairs that provide a 60 cm2 
stimulation surface area. When located on the upper calf, the 
electrode array is circumferential and will stimulate sensory 
dermatomes S2-L4 independent of rotational placement. The 
stimulator generates bipolar, symmetrical, current-regulated 
pulses with alternating leading phase polarity. The stimula-
tion pulse has zero net current flow to prevent development 
of polar concentrations with extended use that may cause 
adverse skin reactions.37,38 The peak output voltage and cur-
rent are 100 V and 100 mA, respectively. The phase duration 
scales from 100 to 200 µsec with the stimulation intensity. The 
inter-pulse intervals vary randomly such that the simulation 
frequency has a mean of 80 Hz with a uniform distribution 
between 60 and 100 Hz. High-frequency  
stimulation induces

an elevation in enkephalins that act through the δ-opioid 
receptor39,40 whereas prescription opioids primarily act 
through the µ-opioid receptor at concentrations associated 
with clinical use.41 Both receptors are involved in descending 
pain inhibition, including in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord 
where they inhibit pain signal transmission.13,39 Individuals 
taking prescription opioids or who have developed tolerance 
remain responsive to high-frequency induced analgesia.42 
Currently published evidence suggests that stimulation 
intensity directly influences the degree of analgesia in a 
dose-dependent fashion.43,44 Stimulation below the level 
of sensory perception does not produce analgesia, and the 
degree of analgesia is correlated to the stimulation intensity. 
These and other studies suggest that stimulation should be 
delivered at a “strong but comfortable” level. Prior to first 
use, the device is calibrated to the user’s sensation threshold 
by an algorithm using both ascending and descending method 
of limits. Subsequent stimulation is automatically controlled. 
The initial therapeutic level is set so that the pulse charge is 
6 decibels above sensation. This level is typically perceived 
as “strong but comfortable”. The stimulation intensity is then 
periodically increased by an adaptive algorithm to compen-
sate for nerve de-sensitization and to activate deep tissue 
sensory afferents.45 The user may also manually decrease or 
increase intensity. Each therapy session is 60 minutes, with 
sessions automatically starting every other hour. The 1-hour 
duration matches the time course of endogenous opioid lev-
els in the cerebrospinal fluid in response to high-frequency 
peripheral nerve stimulation.46,47 These studies showed that 
a statistically significant increase in cerebrospinal fluid opi-
oid concentration can be measured after 20–45 minutes of 
stimulation and remains elevated for 60 minutes with con-
tinued stimulation. Further stimulation beyond 60 minutes 
decreases opioid levels. 
Chronic pain is often worse in the evening and overnight.48 
Accordingly, the majority of chronic pain patients complain 
of disturbed sleep and daytime lethargy.49 Polysomnography 
studies show that compared to normal subjects, chronic pain 
patients have shorter sleep duration, lower sleep efficiency, 
and greater numbers of periodic leg movements.25 Despite 
these sleep abnormalities; GP-TENS is typically not used 
during sleep to help control pain. In fact, in the US, TENS 
carry an FDA mandated warning against use during sleep. 
The safety concern is the potential for unnoticed electrode 
peeling leading to small skin-electrode contact area and an 
inversely high current density that may cause discomfort, 
or in the extreme, tissue damage. The FS-TENS used in this 
study is cleared by the FDA for use during sleep because of 
its mechanical design and an algorithm that detects electrode 
peeling. The device also has a tri-axial accelerometer to moni-
tor body orientation and movement, from which it determines 
when a user is sleeping using actigraphy methods.50 If a user 
is determined to be sleeping, then stimulation intensity is 
reduced to lessen the likelihood of disrupting sleep.
The FS-TENS device may be used with an optional 
smartphone program (“app”) that tracks utilization and objec-
tive sleep metrics. These data have the potential to influence 
study compliance, which has been identified as an issue in 
clinical studies of self-administered TENS.51 Although the 
app was available to participants, its use was not required nor 
assessed. Therefore its impact and potential benefits could 
not be assessed.
Data analysis
The study cohort was partitioned into two groups; responders 
and non-responders as defined in “Procedures and outcome 
variables” section. The primary analysis was to compare 
demographic characteristics, clinical variables, and pain 
measures between the two groups at baseline and change from 
baseline to study end. Baseline variables were quantified by 
their mean and standard deviation (SD) if continuous, and by 
frequency counts if categorical. Confidence intervals (CIs) for 
frequency counts were determined using the modified Wald 
method. Although BPI-SF items are ordinal variables, they 
were analyzed as continuous values as has typically been the 
practice in pain studies. Group differences among continuous 
and ordinal variables were evaluated by the non-parametric 
Mann–Whitney U test. Dichotomous categorical variables 
(eg, sex) were compared using the two-sample z-test. The 
Pearson’s chi-squared test was applied to contingency tables 
(eg, age categories, pain duration categories) to evaluate how 
likely observed differences arose by chance.
Results
A total of 130 participants were enrolled. Follow-up ques-
tionnaires were obtained for 94 (72.3%) after 30 days and 
88 (67.7%) after 60 days. The only difference in baseline 
characteristics between participants who completed the 
60-day questionnaire and for those in whom follow-up was 
not obtained, was that the former were less likely to be female 
(45.5% vs 69.4%, P=0.015). A per-protocol analysis was con-
ducted using the 88 participants with 60-day follow-up data.
The FS-TENS device instructions encourage daily use to 
manage pain. At the 60-day follow-up, 55 (62.5%) reported 
using the device daily; with 31 (35.2%) using the device 3 
or more hours per day. All participants reported using the

Fixed-site high-frequency TENS for treatment of chronic pain
device at least several times per week. The utilization level 
was unchanged from the 30-day follow-up where 58 (65.9%) 
reported daily use. There were no adverse events requiring 
termination from the study. One subject described a sore calf 
and another complained of skin irritation. These issues are 
known to occur infrequently with TENS and were resolved 
by temporarily stopping device usage.
Table 1 lists the baseline characteristics of the study 
cohort. Male sex was slightly more prevalent than female 
and most participants were 50 years of age or older. The 
study participants reported widespread pain with a mean of 
3.4 pain sites. All 88 participants reported low back and/or 
lower extremity pain; with low back pain identified by 75 
(85.3%) and lower extremity pain by 63 (71.6%). In addition, 
55 (62.5%) noted upper extremity pain. Participants reported 
a mean of 2.1 painful health conditions. The most common 
were arthritis (61.4%), diabetes (39.8%), sciatica (27.3%), 
and fibromyalgia (26.1%). 
Figure 2 shows the PGIC ratings of the study participants. 
At the 60-day follow-up, 71 (80.7%, 95% CI 71.1%–87.7%) 
reported that their chronic pain and overall health was 
“improved” or “much improved” and were classified as 
responders. The remaining 17 (19.3%, 95% CI 12.3%–
28.9%) reported no change or worsening and were classified 
as non-responders. Most of the improvement occurred within 
the first 30 days as the 60-day results were essentially the 
same as the first follow-up assessment. Table 2 shows 30-day 
and 60-day changes in BPI-SF items from baseline. At 60 
days, there were statistically significant reductions in worst 
pain, pain interference with sleep, walking ability, and gen-
eral activity, and increased pain relief. Most of the changes 
occurred within the first 30 days. 
Table 3 compares baseline characteristics in non-respond-
ers and responders. There were no statistically significant 
differences. The total number of pain sites and proportion 
of participants with lower extremity, low back, and upper 
extremity pain were similar in the two groups. The number 
of painful health conditions was similar in the two groups. 
Inter-group differences for specific conditions were not 
examined because of the small sample sizes.
There was no difference in utilization between the 
non-responder and responder groups. Among the former, 
53% used the device daily as compared to 65% in the latter 
(P=0.36). As shown in Table 4, there were numerical trends 
toward a greater reduction in pain interference with walking 
ability (P=0.071) and sleep (P=0.079), and greater pain relief 
(P=0.085) in responders as compared to non-responders. 
There was a large difference in pain medication use, with

Discussion
This study investigated the efficacy of FS-TENS in chronic 
low back and lower extremity pain. An open label design 
was utilized because it was impractical to blind sham devices 
given the extensive online availability of information about 
TENS in general and this OTC device in particular. A total 
of 130 participants were enrolled, with 94 (72.3%) complet-
ing the 30-day questionnaire and 88 (67.7%) completing the 
60-day questionnaire. The study used limited email contact 
and offered minimal financial benefits. As a result, it may 
not have been optimized for protocol adherence. With the 
exception of sex, baseline characteristics did not differenti-
ate participants who completed the study from those who 
did not. About 70% of those lost to follow-up were female 
compared to approximately 45% who completed the study. 
There are sex differences in pain and analgesia,52 however it is 
not apparent how those differences would influence attrition 
in this study. The reasons for failed follow-up in the present 
study may have included absence of efficacy, side effects, 
and the inability or lack of interest in completing the online 
questionnaire. The relative contributions of these factors are 
unknown and therefore the potential for selection bias cannot 
be determined. In future studies, the utilization tracking capa-
bilities of the device should be used to help differentiate true 
study dropouts from those who failed to complete follow-up 
questionnaires. Another potential source of selection bias is 
the inclusion criteria. The current study findings may not be 
generalizable to subjects under the age of 40 and those with 
household incomes below the inclusion threshold.
Recent epidemiological studies indicate that most chronic 
pain sufferers have multiple sites of pain and painful health 
conditions.1 The participants in this study followed a similar 
pattern with a mean of 2.1 (SD 1.2) painful health conditions 
and 3.4 (SD 1.2) pain sites. Consistent with the study design, 
all participants had low back and/or lower extremity pain. 
However, 62.5% also reported upper extremity pain despite 
its absence from the inclusion criteria. This distributed nature 
of chronic pain presents a challenge to treatment with GP-
TENS, and may help explain inconsistent results reported 
in the clinical literature.5,11,53 In fact, there is evidence that a 
barrier to effective use of TENS is the amount of effort needed 
to regularly apply the available devices.51,54,55

Fixed-site high-frequency TENS for treatment of chronic pain
may be necessary to capture the different ways that pain may 
be impacted.59 As an example, if a patient’s use of TENS is 
primarily to facilitate sleep, then the impact on pain intensity 
may be limited whereas sleep quality may be improved with 
a positive effect on quality of life as reflected in the PGIC.
There is no direct benchmark against which to compare 
the responder rate in this study. Despite the frequent use of 
PGIC in chronic pain clinical trials,56 it has only been used 
in one TENS study to our knowledge.60 In that study, TENS 
combined with local injections of cobalamin and/or lidocaine 
were evaluated in post-herpetic neuralgia. Therefore, the 
current study appears to be the first to use PGIC to directly 
assess the benefit of TENS in a diverse chronic pain cohort. 
Nevertheless, it is instructive to review pharmacological 
studies with similar designs. In an 8-week non-interventional, 
flexible dosing study comparing pregabalin and routine clini-
cal care for chronic low back pain with accompanying neu-
ropathic pain, 80.8% (pregabalin) and 45.4% (routine care) 
of subjects reported improvement on the PGIC.61 A 4-week 
open-label, flexible dosing study assessing the efficacy of 
pregabalin in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy 
or post-herpetic neuralgia under typical clinical conditions 
reported improvement on PGIC of 81.0%.62 In a study of pre-
gabalin and milnacipran in fibromyalgia, 53.0% of subjects 
reported improvement in PGIC during a 4–12-week open 
label run-in period with pregabalin.63 These studies suggest 
that FS-TENS mediated improvement in chronic pain, as 
assessed using PGIC, may be similar to pharmacological 
interventions.

scale, after 60 days of using the FS-TENS device. PGIC is 
recommended as a core outcome measure in chronic pain 
trials56 and has been used to define clinically important dif-
ferences in pain intensity57 and quality of life.58 As a global 
assessment, PGIC aggregates the subject’s overall experience 
including changes in pain intensity, changes in sleep and 
function, side effects, and convenience into one measure. 
The advantage of PGIC is that it captures the outcomes of 
interest to each participant. The disadvantage is that it may 
be unclear how the rating relates to specific aspects of pain. 
Moreover, it is likely that this relationship varies across par-
ticipants. When investigating the efficacy of a therapy that is 
applied with variable dosing and scheduling, a global rating

Relationship between baseline 
characteristics and FS-TENS efficacy
A key objective of this study was to determine if baseline 
characteristics predict response to FS-TENS. This informa-
tion may enhance our scientific understanding of TENS 
induced analgesia and has clinical implications. None of the 
baseline characteristics showed statistically significant dif-
ferences between the responder and non-responder groups. 
This finding may be interpreted within the traditional view 
that TENS generates localized analgesia. In particular, if the 
FS-TENS device is limited to providing lower extremity pain 
relief, consistent with its upper calf location, then we must 
assume that this local analgesia lowered the participants’ 
overall chronic pain sufficiently to result in a positive PGIC 
rating (ie, improved or much improved). While possible, this 
interpretation appears unlikely. First, lower extremity sites 
accounted for only 31.4% (SD 29.1%) of the pain sites among 
responders. Second, 29.6% of responders did not report any 
lower extremity pain sites. A more likely explanation is that a 
portion of the FS-TENS benefit was from analgesia outside of 
the stimulation area, either proximally in the low back region 
or extra-segmentally in the upper extremity. These analgesic 
effects are likely secondary to activations of descending 
pain inhibition.13,20 In support of this hypothesis, prior stud-
ies of experimental and chronic pain have demonstrated 
contralateral, proximal, and extrasegmental analgesia with 
TENS.64-71 Another possibility is a TENS induced reduction in 
sympathetic tone,72,73 because chronic pain is often associated 
with sympathetic overactivity.74-76 Additional mechanisms by 
which focal stimulation may evoke widespread analgesia are 
through reversal of maladaptive changes in the central ner-
vous system (ie, central sensitization)77 and in the functional 
interactions between the cardiovascular and pain regulation 
systems.78
The fact that baseline characteristics did not predict 
response to FS-TENS is consistent with prior studies which 
have reported few reliable predictors of TENS response.79,80 
Johnson et al used questionnaires to follow 179 long-term 
TENS users and were unable to find any correlation between 
patient characteristics and analgesic efficacy.80 Predicting 
the effect of TENS appears to depend on the choice of out-
come measure.81 In one of the few studies that did identify 
predictors of TENS analgesia, Koke et al82 reported higher 
patient expectations, non-severe pain, and neuropathic pain 
as predictors of long-term (6 months) TENS use. They also 
reported a limited pain distribution (defined as ≤2 sites) 
and intermittent pain as predictors of a clinically important 
(≥33%) reduction in pain. These results contrast with those 
in the current study in which the number of pain sites and 
pain severity were not predictive of an analgesic response. 
However, the two studies cannot be directly compared due 
to differences in outcome measures, stimulation parameters, 
therapy period, and electrode size and placement. 
Pain domains impacted by FS-TENS
The primary outcome measure in this study was PGIC, which 
represents the participant’s overall assessment of changes in 
their chronic pain over the course of the study. An important 
ancillary objective is to identify those pain domains that 
improve with therapy and ostensibly integrate to yield a 
positive PGIC rating. Gladwell et al59 showed that subjects 
with chronic pain utilize TENS in disparate and occasionally 
surprising ways. This apportioning of the beneficial effects of 
TENS across multiple pain domains may complicate efforts 
to demonstrate its efficacy. Despite these challenges, the 
results from our study support several conclusions about how 
pain is impacted by FS-TENS. First, the influence on pain 
interference is greater than on pain intensity. In particular, 
interference with sleep and walking ability showed numerical 
trends toward a greater reduction in the responders. Similarly, 
pain relief showed a numerical trend toward greater improve-
ment in the responder group. These findings are particularly 
relevant to the design of future studies. Most TENS studies 
have used changes in pain intensity as the primary outcome 
measure. However, the current and other studies59 suggest 
that pain intensity may not efficiently represent the impact of 
TENS. In fact, the focus on pain intensity may have contrib-
uted to low fidelity studies that have contributed to confusion 
regarding the clinical effectiveness of TENS.5 
Changes in the use of concomitant pain medications are 
an important outcome measure in chronic pain clinical tri-
als.56 There is no accepted standard method for measuring 
medication use. Patient self-reports are commonly used in 
both clinical and research settings. Although straightforward, 
studies show that these approaches can measure medication 
use effectively.83 In this study, changes in pain medications 
were recorded using a single-item global self-rating that 
ranged from “decreased a lot” to “increased a lot”. A large 
difference between responders and non-responders was 
found, with 80.3% of the former group reporting a reduction 
(“decreased a lot” or “decreased a little”) in pain medication 
use compared to 11.8% of non-responders (P<0.001). The 
design of this study as a series of online surveys made it chal-
lenging to monitor pain medication use. We were therefore 
unable to determine if specific classes of analgesics were most 
likely to be affected or to quantify changes in  
medication use.

Fixed-site high-frequency TENS for treatment of chronic pain
Nevertheless, these results mirror TENS associated reduc-
tions in post-surgical analgesic use.84
Summary
The results from this study suggest that FS-TENS is a safe 
and effective option for treating chronic low back and lower 
extremity pain. The most significant impact was a decrease 
in the use of concomitant pain medications. In addition, 
trends toward reduced interference with walking ability and 
sleep, and greater pain relief were observed. These results 
further motivate the use of FS-TENS in development of 
wearable analgesic devices. The study results also support 
the hypothesis that the effects of TENS can be widespread, 
most likely arising from activation of descending pain 
inhibition.
