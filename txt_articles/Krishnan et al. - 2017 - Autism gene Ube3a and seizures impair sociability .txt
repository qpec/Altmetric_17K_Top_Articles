Summary
Maternally inherited 15q11-13 chromosomal triplications cause a frequent and highly penetrant 
autism linked to increased gene dosages of UBE3A, which both possesses ubiquitin-ligase and 
transcriptional co-regulatory functions. Here, using in vivo mouse genetics, we show that 
increasing UBE3A in the nucleus down-regulates glutamatergic synapse organizer cerebellin-1

 (Cbln1) that is needed for sociability in mice. Epileptic seizures also repress Cbln1 and are found 
to expose sociability impairments in mice with asymptomatic increases of UBE3A. This Ube3a-
seizure synergy maps to glutamate neurons of the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) where 
Cbln1 deletions impair sociability and weaken glutamatergic transmission. We provide preclinical 
evidence that viral-vector-based chemogenetic activations of, or Cbln1 restorations in VTA 
glutamatergic neurons rescues sociability deficits induced by Ube3a and/or seizures. Our results 
suggest a gene × seizure interaction in VTA glutamatergic neurons that impairs sociability by 
downregulating Cbln1, a key node in the expanding protein interaction network of autism genes.
Diverse genetic defects, immunological insults, and certain epilepsies have been implicated 
in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)1,2. These varied etiologies may 
converge to disrupt specific molecular interactions in specialized neuronal subtypes to 
produce autism’s sociability deficits. A common and highly penetrant genetic ASD results 
from maternally inherited 15q11-13 triplications3,4 that triples the neuron-expressed gene 
dosage of UBE3A, which is deleted in Angelman syndrome5–8. UBE3A encodes a dual-
function E3 ubiquitin ligase9 and transcriptional co-regulator10. We previously demonstrated 
that mice with increased genomic Ube3a copies (“Ube3a2x” mice) display impaired 
sociability, diminished conspecific ultrasonic vocalizations and heightened repetitive self-
grooming, together with deficits in cortical excitatory transmission4. However, the 
subcellular locus, downstream molecular mechanisms and circuit deficits responsible for 
UBE3A’s impact on sociability remain unknown.
UBE3A effects map to the nucleus
To address these questions, we first examined the altered cortical transcriptional landscape in 
Ube3a2x mice which display a ~3 fold increase in total UBE3A protein4,11. On an 
Affymetrix microarray analysis of total RNA from whole cortex of adult Ube3a2x and wild 
type (WT) littermate mice, we identified 190 up- and 408 down-regulated genes (p<0.05 
FDR adjusted, ±1.4 fold cutoff, Supplementary Table 1), enriched for glutamatergic synaptic 
transmission function (Supplementary Table 2). To understand how they interact with known 
ASD genes, we visualized (Fig.1a, Extended Data Fig. 1) how their encoded proteins are 
positioned within a network of protein-protein physical interactions with 276 genes strongly 
implicated in autism12 (Supplementary Table 3). As a candidate downstream mediator of 
UBE3A’s effects, we focused on Cerebellin-1 (CBLN1) because it was dose-dependently 
repressed by UBE3A and binds presynaptic NRXN1/2/3 and postsynaptic GRID1/213–17, 
two gene families deleted or mutated in ASD3,12. NRXN-CBLN1-GRID trimolecular 
complexes trans-synaptically organize glutamatergic synapse formation16–19. Cbln1 also 
compensates for congenital losses of Cbln320. With quantitative real-time PCR, we found 
Cbln1 downregulations in cortical samples from Ube3a1x and Ube3a2x mice (heterozygous 
or homozygous for a C-terminal FLAG-tagged Ube3a transgene4, respectively). Cbln1 was 
also repressed in “Ube3aNLS” mice (heterozygous for a FLAG-tagged UBE3A confined to 
the nucleus with two nuclear localization signals, Extended Data Fig. 2a–d) and in Ube3a2x 
(untagged) mice (homozygous for an untagged Ube3a gene) (Fig. 1b). Cortical Cbln1 
expression was elevated in hemizygous Ube3amKO mice (modeling Angelman syndrome)5, 
whether the deleted Ube3a allele was inherited from an “asymptomatic” mother (paternally-

 deleted allele, “p-Ube3amKO”) or “affected” mother (maternally-deleted allele, “m-
Ube3amKO”)21. Several UBE3A down-regulated genes displayed dose-dependent and 
nuclear-mediated effects (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 3), a finding less consistent for 
UBE3A up-regulated genes (Extended Data Fig. 4).
Transgenic increases of Ube3a also impacted conspecific social behavior in a dose-
dependent manner (irrespective of the presence of a C-terminal tag). However, this dose 
dependence was overcome by targeting UBE3A to the nucleus. In the three chamber 
sociability task22 (see Methods), Ube3a2x mice4 as well as Ube3a2x (untagged) mice 
displayed impaired sociability (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). Two independent 
Ube3aNLS lines (lines “3” and “7”) also displayed impaired sociability. In contrast, 
sociability was not repressed in Ube3a1x or Ube3amKO mice. Ube3a2x (untagged) and 
Ube3aNLS mice also emitted fewer ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) (Fig.1e) and displayed 
fewer physical interactions when exposed to genotype-matched strangers (Extended Data 
Fig. 2g). These social phenotypes could not be explained by changes in grooming, olfaction, 
exploration or locomotion (Extended Data Fig. 2h–m). Therefore, an otherwise 
asymptomatic increase of UBE3A (Extended Data Fig. 2a), when confined to the nucleus (in 
Ube3aNLS mice), recapitulates the transcriptional downregulations and impaired sociability 
seen in Ube3a2x mice.
To directly connect decreased Cbln1 expression to impaired sociability, we deleted Cbln1 in 
glutamatergic VGluT2+ (vesicular glutamate transporter type 2) neurons. 
VGluT2Cre.Cbln1fl/fl mice had reduced Cbln1 expression across several brain regions (Fig. 
1f, Extended Data Fig.5a), impaired sociability (Fig. 1g, Extended Data Fig. 5b,c), and 
fewer USVs and physical interactions with stranger females (Fig. 1h, Extended Data Fig. 
5d). Grooming, exploration, locomotion and olfaction were unaffected, although rotarod 
performance was mildly impaired (Extended Data Fig. 5e–k). Thus, deleting Cbln1 in 
VGluT2Cre-labeled neurons reconstitutes the social deficits of Ube3a2x (tagged or 
untagged) and Ube3aNLS mice. Together with the reported sociability impairments in 
homozygous Grid1KO mice23, these results implicate glutamate synapses dependent on 
CBLN1 and GRID1 in promoting normal sociability.
Seizure-induced deficits are UBE3A-dependent
Cbln1 mRNA is also repressed by increased neuronal activity in cerebellum in culture after 
depolarization and in vivo after status epilepticus24. Therefore, we tested whether recurrent 
seizures can concurrently repress Cbln1 and sociability. We exposed WT mice to 10 
successive daily injections of GABA antagonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) at subconvulsant 
doses (30 mg/kg) and observed a gradual increase in seizure severity (Fig. 2a left, Extended 
Data Fig. 6a,b). 24h later, Cbln1 mRNA was repressed in several brain regions (Fig. 2a 
right), sociability was impaired25 and social USVs were reduced (Fig. 2b,c) without 
impacting exploration, locomotion, grooming or olfaction (Extended Data Fig. 6c–k). This 
sociability deficit persisted for 30 days (Extended Data Fig. 6l,m). To examine how Ube3a 
dosage might impact seizure-induced social impairments, we applied 10 PTZ-induced 
seizures to p-Ube3amKO, m-Ube3amKO and their corresponding WT littermates. Seizure 
severities were similar, but both Ube3amKO mice were resistant to seizure-induced deficits in

 sociability (Fig. 2d–g, Extended Data Fig. 6n). Conversely, to test if “asymptomatic” 
increases of UBE3A augment seizure-induced sociability deficits, we applied a 
“subthreshold” PTZ paradigm to Ube3a1x (untagged) mice where five 30 mg/kg PTZ 
injections are delivered every other day. 24h later, Ube3a1x (untagged) mice displayed 
impaired sociability whereas WT littermates were unaffected (Fig. 2h–j, Extended Data Fig. 
6o,p). Seizure effects were not explained by changes in Ube3a mRNA (Extended Data Fig. 
6q). Overall, these results demonstrate that UBE3A is necessary for seizure-induced 
decreases in sociability and Cbln1 expression, and illustrate an Ube3a-seizure synergy in 
promoting impaired sociability.
UBE3A-seizure synergy maps to VTA
To identify the neuronal circuits underlying this synergy, we engineered our full-length 
Ube3a-FLAG construct4 with a loxP-flanked transcriptional/translational blocker (TB) 
cassette in intron 1. In these “LoxTBUbe3a” transgenic mice, cell-type specific Cre 
expression deletes the TB cassette to activate UBE3A-FLAG expression and moderately 
increase total Ube3a mRNA (Fig. 3a,b,f, Extended Data Fig. 7a–h). Baseline sociability was 
not impaired in mice with UBE3A-FLAG expression targeted by VGluT2Cre, VGaTCre, 
EMXCre, Math1Cre, DATCre, DBHCre, ChATCre or ePetCre driver lines (Fig. 3c,g, 
Extended Data Figs. 7c–h, 8). However, sociability deficits were produced by the 
“subthreshold” PTZ paradigm in mice with UBE3A-FLAG increased in VGluT2 or DAT 
(dopamine transporter) expressing neurons (Fig. 3d,e,h,i, Extended Data Fig. 8). DAT+ and 
VGluT2+ neurons co-exist in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), alongside GABAergic and 
glutamate/dopamine co-releasing neurons26,27. Optogenetic modulation of VTA 
dopaminergic projections to nucleus accumbens (NAc) alters social approach behavior in 
mice28. VTA VGluT2+ neurons are situated in medial VTA29 and project to several regions 
including NAc26, but have not been ascribed a role in social behavior. Following 10 daily 
recurrent PTZ seizures, VTA Cbln1 mRNA levels were elevated in Ube3amKO mice and 
repressed in Ube3a1x (untagged) mice (Fig. 2k, with similar results obtained in Ube3a1x4 
mice, Extended Data Fig. 9a). Thus, changes in VTA Cbln1 expression parallel the relative 
resistance of Ube3amKO and vulnerability of Ube3a1x (tagged or untagged) mice to seizure-
induced sociability deficits.
To selectively increase untagged UBE3A in VTA VGluT2+ neurons, we injected the VTA of 
VGluT2Cre and WT littermate mice with AAV-hSyn-DIO-Ube3a (human isoform 3, 
enabling Cre-recombinase mediated expression of untagged Ube3a, Fig. 3j). Sociability was 
preserved at baseline, but impaired by the “subthreshold” PTZ paradigm (Fig. 3k–m, 
Extended Data Fig. 9b,c). Thus, increasing UBE3A selectively in VTA VGluT2+ neurons 
synergizes with seizures to impair sociability.
Midbrain VTA-targeted deletion of Cbln1
To link VTA Cbln1 mRNA down-regulations to sociability deficits, we infused AAVCreGFP 
(or AAVGFP) into VTA of Cbln1fl/fl mice. 20d later, Cre-injected mice displayed impaired 
sociability without changes in locomotion or exploration (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 9d–f). 
Similarly, mice with VGluT2 neuron-targeted deletions of Cbln1 in VTA displayed impaired

 sociability (AAV-encoded Cre-RFP or RFP alone driven by the VGluT2 promoter, 28d later; 
Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 9g). These effects were cell-type specific in VTA: Cbln1 
deletions restricted to DAT+ neurons did not impair sociability (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 
9h). Given Cbln1’s role in the integrity of cerebellar glutamatergic synapses14,28, we tested 
whether Cbln1 deletions in VTA or recurrent seizures impair glutamatergic transmission. We 
deleted VTA Cbln1 by injecting AAVCreGFP into VTA of Cbln1fl/fl mice harboring a Cre-
inducible form of a light-activated excitatory opsin (Channelorhodopsin-2, ChR2; ChR2-
EYFP or “Ai32” mice), enabling light-induced excitation of axon terminals in VTA targets 
(Fig. 4d). 6 weeks later, patch-clamp recordings from medium spiny neurons (MSN) in NAc 
medial shell (a VTA glutamatergic neuron target26), with GABAA receptor antagonist 
bicuculline present revealed that VTA Cbln1 deletion or the experience of 10 PTZ-induced 
seizures strongly reduces light-evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs, Fig. 4e, 
Extended Data Fig. 9i–l). The frequency of spontaneous EPSCs in NAc medial shell MSNs 
was also decreased (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 9i). To examine glutamatergic transmission 
specifically from VTA VGluT2+ neurons, we injected AAV-DIO-ChR2-EYFP into the VTA 
of VGluT2Cre.Cbln1fl/fl and VGluT2Cre mice. 30d later, VGluT2-specific Cbln1 deletion 
also repressed these light-evoked EPSCs in NAc (Fig. 4g,h).
VTA glutamate neurons drive sociability
These results suggested that reducing VTA glutamatergic transmission might itself impair 
sociability. We selectively deleted VGluT2 in VTA by injecting AAVCreGFP (or AAVGFP) 
into VGluT2fl/fl mice. 20 days later, VTA-targeted VGluT2 deletions impaired sociability 
without affecting locomotion or exploration (Fig. 4i, Extended Data Fig. 9m–o). Again, 
these effects were cell-type specific: VGluT2 deletion in DAT+ neurons did not impair 
sociability (Fig. 4j, Extended Data Fig. 9p). Thus, a viral-mediated or seizure-induced loss 
of Cbln1 in VTA VGluT2+ neurons impairs VTA glutamatergic synaptic transmission that is 
necessary for normal sociability.
To interrogate how acutely regulating VTA VGluT2+ neuron activity impacts sociability, we 
applied chemogenetics approaches. VGluT2Cre mice received VTA injections of AAV-DIO-
HA-KORD-IRES-citrine, permitting Cre-dependent expression of an inhibitory Gi-coupled 
designer receptor activated by Salvinorin-B [SALB]. 28d later, subcutaneous administration 
of SALB acutely repressed sociability (Fig. 5a, Extended Data Fig. 10a). Conversely, to 
acutely increase VTA VGluT2+ neuron activity, VGluT2Cre mice were injected with AAV-
DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry in the VTA, enabling the expression of an excitatory Gq-coupled 
designer receptor activated by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). 28d later, intraperitoneal CNO 
administration acutely increased sociability in seizure-naïve mice (persisting through a 
second 5 minutes of a “social trial”, Fig. 5b, Extended Data Fig. 10b).
Rescuing sociability deficits
Acute chemogenetic activation of VTA VGluT2+ neurons also therapeutically restored 
sociability in mice with deficits produced by the Ube3a-seizure synergy or by ten PTZ-
induced seizures (Fig. 5c,d, Extended Data Fig. 10c,d). VGluT2Cre mice were co-injected 
with AAV-hSyn-DIO-Ube3a and either AAV-DIO-GFP or AAV-hSyn-DIO-Cbln1-IRES-

 RFP. Increased Cbln1 expression in VTA VGluT2+ neurons did not affect baseline social 
behavior or seizure severity scores, but did protect against the sociability deficits produced 
by the UBE3A seizure synergy (Fig. 5e–g, Extended Data Fig. 10e). These results indicate 
that diminished Cbln1 expression in VTA VGluT2+ neurons plays a critical pathogenic role 
in mediating the effects of seizures and increased Ube3a on sociability.
Discussion
Our results suggest that UBE3A increases found in 15q11-13 ASD patients11 may repress 
CBLN1 expression to disrupt NRXN-CBLN1-GRID1 complexes and compromise 
glutamatergic synaptic transmission. This mechanism may also contribute to social 
impairments in patients with biologically-related genetic defects (e.g., GRID1 or NRXN1 
deletions) and other ASD patients with comorbid seizures2. We show that neuronal UBE3A 
is necessary for seizure-induced Cbln1 repression, potentially functioning as a transducer of 
pathologic activity-induced changes in gene expression30. UBE3A may repress Cbln1 
through its transcriptional co-regulatory functions10,31,32. For example, UBE3A physically 
interacts with MECP233 (methyl CpG-binding protein 2, deleted in Rett syndrome) that 
represses a subset of genes through interactions with the NCoR repressor complex (nuclear 
receptor co-repressor)34. Seizures upregulate the transcriptional repressor REST (RE-1 
silencing transcription factor) in hippocampus35,36 as well as in VTA (Extended Data Fig. 
10f), and Cbln1 intron 2 contains a consensus RE-1 that binds REST37 (Extended Data Fig. 
10g). Seizures may also enhance UBE3A’s transcriptional modulatory functions by 
dephosphorylating threonine 480 (T485 in humans) to promote nuclear translocation38. 
Indeed, our behavioral and molecular findings in Ube3aNLS mice support such a model. 
With native UBE3A still present and the potential to homomultimerize39, our experimental 
approach does not exclude a role of UBE3A’s E3-ligase functions9,38,40. Increased UBE3A 
was found to amplify the detrimental effects of seizures on sociability, an effect localized to 
VTA glutamatergic neurons where Cbln1 repression plays a major role. Importantly, 
restoring Cbln1 expression in these neurons was sufficient to therapeutically rescue impaired 
sociability. Seizures also synergized with increased UBE3A in dopaminergic neurons, likely 
occurring through Cbln1-independent mechanisms41,42. Overall, these findings establish that 
VTA glutamatergic neurons drive sociability, and implicate Cbln1 downregulations within 
these neurons as a critical convergence point in the pathogenesis of sociability deficits in a 
genetic form of autism with epilepsy comorbidity.
Methods
Mice
The Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals and the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approved all mouse 
protocols. Mice were housed at the Center for Life Sciences barrier animal facility in sex-
matched groups of 3–5 with ad libitum food (except for olfaction testing) and water access. 
Lights were on between 0700 and 1900hrs when behavioral testing/seizure induction was 
performed. Unless otherwise specified, littermate controls were used and cohorts were a 
mixture of male and female mice at a ratio of approximately 1:1. For experiments involving

 PTZ/saline injections in WT mice (e.g., Fig. 2a–c), separate cohorts of WT FVB mice were 
bred within our colony. Ube3a transgenic mice were generated using bacterial artificial 
chromosome (BAC) recombineering techniques as described previously4,43,44. For 
Ube3aNLS mice, three FLAG tags were added to the C-terminal end of this construct 
followed by two in-frame nuclear localization signals from the SV40 large antigen, followed 
by two stop codons. For LoxTBUbe3a mice, a loxP-flanked transcriptional blocker cassette 
(containing the Engrailed 2 splice acceptor followed by a poly-A tail and a neomycin 
resistance positive selection marker45) was introduced into intron 1 of the C-terminal triple-
FLAG tagged Ube3a to block expression of all splice variants of Ube3a. For experiments in 
Fig. 3a–i and Extended Data Fig. 7,8, LoxTBUbe3a mice were bred to homozygosity. Since 
there is evidence that C-terminal extensions/modifications of UBE3A are detrimental to 
ubiquitin ligase activity against certain targets32,46, we also generated Ube3a1x (untagged) 
mice with a full length Ube3a construct that is unmodified. BAC DNA was prepared using a 
Nucleobond BAC maxi-preparation kit (Clontech) and validated by sequencing analysis. 
Constructs were linearized and microinjected into FVB/NJ embryos at the BIDMC 
Transgenic Core Facility. Male and female (tagged4 or untagged) Ube3a1x mice were 
crossed to result in WT, Ube3a1x and Ube3a2x mice. To determine transgenic Ube3a copy 
number, genomic DNA was isolated from mouse tail clips using the Purelink Genomic DNA 
Mini Kit (ThermoFisher). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to measure genomic 
copies of Ube3a and Tfrc (transferrin receptor) using Taqman® Mm00238405_cn probe 
(Ube3a) and Taqman® Copy Number Reference Assay (Tfrc) with Taqman® Genotyping 
Master Mix (ThermoFisher). Absolute Ube3a copy number was calculated using the 
2ˆ(−ΔΔCT) method and multiplying by a factor of two (two Tfrc alleles). This technique 
revealed the following approximate total copy numbers (i.e., including the two native Ube3a 
copies): Ube3a2x (7.8 ± 0.4, n=4), LoxTBUbe3a (8.97 ± 0.16, n=5), Ube3a2x untagged 
(5.13 ± 0.15, n=8), Ube3aNLS7 (3.59 ± 0.13, n=6). Ube3amKO mice5 (Jackson Labs) were 
backcrossed 9 generations to FVB/NJ before behavioral testing. Both p-Ube3amKO and m-
Ube3amKO mice were generated based on the breeding scheme described in Fig. 1b. The 
following lines were bred into an FVB/NJ genetic background for 6 or more generations. 
Cbln1fl/fl mice17 were a generous gift from Dr. Masayoshi Mishina (Nigata University, 
Tokyo, Japan). VGluT2Cre47 mice and VGaTCre mice47 were provided as a generous gift 
from Dr. Bradford Lowell (BIDMC). VGluT2fl/fl 48, EMX-Ires-Cre49, Math1Cre50, 
DATCre51, DBHCre52, ChATCre53, ePETCre54, and Ai32/”ChR2-EYFP”55 lines of mice 
were purchased from Jackson Labs.
Tissue
Brains were rapidly removed and submerged in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 
20–30s. For the isolation of cortex (microarray and validation studies), two “slabs” of total 
cortex were dissected using curved forceps. For tissue punches, the PBS-cooled brain was 
placed in a brain matrix (ASI Instruments) and razor blades were placed at 1mm intervals to 
obtain brain slices. For hippocampal specimens, the entire hippocampal formation from one 
slice was carefully dissected so as to include all subfields. Punches were obtained with a 
1mm (retrosplenial cortex, cerebellum) or a 0.5 mm (rest) punch core needle (Harris 
Unicore, Extended Data Fig. 5a) and immediately frozen to −20 C and stored at −80 C.

 RNA isolation, Affymetrix gene chip hybridization, and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-
PCR)
RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) and column-purified using the 
RNAeasy Protect Mini Kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with 
oligo-dTs and reverse transcriptase (Ambion). Microarray samples were hybridized to an 
Affymetrix GeneChip HT MG-430 PM array with tissue from six biological replicates of 
each genotype (WT and Ube3a2x) pooled into three pairs. Array normalization, expression 
value calculation and clustering analysis were performed using dChip software 
(www.dchip.org). We adjusted the statistical significance (nominal p-value) of the entire 
gene set to account for multiple testing by estimating the False Discovery rate (FDR). While 
estimating FDRs, we used 50 random permutations to obtain a final list of 597 probes that 
satisfied our assumed significance threshold of 0.05. Primer pairs were selected through 
Primer356 with specificity confirmed with Primer-BLAST57. Melt-curve analysis and 
agarose gel electrophoresis were used to confirm a single PCR product of the appropriate 
amplicon size. For microarray validation, 3 separate cDNA samples (each combined from 
two independent biological samples) were amplified through qRT-PCR in triplicate using 
Sybr-Green (Life Technologies) on a BioRad CFX384 Real Time Thermal Cycler. Gene 
expression fold changes were calculated with the comparative CT method58 and normalized 
to GAPDH, with similar results obtained normalizing to RPLP0 (ribosomal protein, large, 
P0) or POLR2a (RNA polymerase II subunit A). Error bars for all qRTPCR experiments are 
an upper error limit that represents a standard error of the mean for technical replicates from 
each sample, were calculated as follows: upper error = 2ˆ[−(average ΔΔCT) + 
[(average(SDgene of interest2 + SDreference gene2)1/2/(sample size)1/2)]]. Primer sequences are in 
Supplementary Table 4.
Gene annotations and protein interactions
Regulated genes were annotated according to Gene Ontology (GO). P-values for enrichment 
of each GO category were calculated using the Category, GOStats, and KEGGREST 
packages of Bioconductor59,60 (Supplementary Table 2). 598 up- and down- regulated genes 
in Ube3a2x mice as well as SFARI (Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative) genes 
identified as strongly implicated in autism12 were used to build an initial physical protein-
protein interaction network by searching seven current, high-quality, human-curated protein 
interaction networks [BioGRID, DIP (Database of Interacting Proteins), HPRD (Human 
Protein Reference Database), InnateDB, IntAct, MatrixDB, and MINT (Molecular 
Interaction Database)]. We searched for and displayed clusters of interactions between 
protein products of pairs of Ube3a-regulated genes, Ube3a-regulated and autism genes, or 
between autism genes. To reduce network complexity, gene nodes with edges connecting to 
a more select set of 276 SFARI genes with the strongest genetic evidence for a causal role in 
autism were included in the final network (Supplementary Table 3). We clustered and 
visualized the interactions using Cytoscape 3.2.0 and its GLay community clustering 
algorithm61.

 Subcellular fractionation and western blotting
Nuclear and cytosolic fractions of cortical samples (Extended Data Fig. 2d) were separated 
using a commercially available reagent-based technique (Fisher Scientific) according to 
manufacturer instructions. Proteins were loaded onto 4–15% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad), 
transferred to PVDF membranes, blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T, and incubated 
overnight at 4 degrees with the following antibodies; anti-Ube3a (#7526, Cell Signaling), 
anti-alpha-Tubulin (#3873, Cell Signaling), and anti-TATA-binding protein (TBP; #8515, 
Cell Signaling). After TBS-T washes, blots were incubated with species-specific HRP-
conjugated secondary antibodies for 1–2 hours at room temperature. Blots were developed 
with Pico chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) and digital images were acquired using the gel 
dock system (Bio-Rad). Following subcellular fractionation, nuclear and cytosolic Ube3a 
levels were normalized to levels of TBP and alpha-Tubulin, respectively.
Immunofluorescence
Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of tribromoethanol and then 
perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were 
cryoprotected in 15% sucrose and then 30% sucrose (each for 24 h) and then frozen in 
optical cutting temperature compound (Fisher Health Care). 16μm sections were cut on a 
cryostat and slide-mounted. When an anti-mouse secondary antibody was used, sections 
were blocked with MOM reagent (Vector) and then with 10% normal goat serum with 1% 
BSA and 0.5% Triton X100 in PBS and incubated at room temperature overnight with 
antibody (anti-UBE3A [1:200, BD Biosciences], anti-PSD95 [1:200, Neuromab], anti-GFP 
[1:200, Abcam] or FITC-conjugated anti-FLAG [1:200, Sigma]) in blocking solution. 
Sections were washed and when required, incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary 
antibodies (Invitrogen) for 3 hours at room temperature, and then mounted in Vectashield 
with DAPI (Vector). Fluorescent images were taken using a LSM510 confocal microscope 
(Zeiss) or the VS120-SL 5 Slide Scanner (Olympus) and “representative” images are 
representative of at least 3 mice per group. For quantitative immunofluorescence (Extended 
Data Fig. 2c), cortex-containing sections of each genotype (Ube3aNLS, Ube3a1x, Ube3a2x) 
were placed on the same slide. Sections were stained as above with FITC-conjugated FLAG 
primary antibody (Sigma). After incubation with primary antibody overnight, sections were 
mounted and imaged. FLAG-FITC staining intensity was quantified from 3 mice per 
genotype. Quantification of nuclear protein was done using Image J and twenty randomly 
chosen cells identified using the DAPI stain were quantified per image; 3 images per mouse 
were examined. Neuropil staining was quantified in the same manner but regions devoid of 
DAPI staining were selected.
Behavioral measurements
Mice were always tested at 7–11 weeks of age and were sexually naïve. For experiments 
testing the effects of viral manipulations on behavior, mice were randomly assigned into two 
groups matched for sex and age. For mice that received seizures (or saline injections), all 
testing was conducted 24h following the last injection (or 30 days later). Prior to testing, 
mice were acclimatized to a dedicated behavioral suite for one hour. Three-chamber testing 
was performed as previously described4. A clear acrylic box (50×100 cm) containing

 dividers with 10×10 cm passageways was employed to create a three-chambered arena. 
Ethovision videotracking software (Noldus) was used with an overhead camera (Rainbow). 
Two small metal enclosures were placed in opposite corners (“left” or “right”). During the 
acclimation trial (5 minutes), mice were placed into the center of the arena and allowed to 
freely explore, following which they were removed and placed into a holding cage. A novel 
sex- and age-matched non-littermate WT mouse was placed in one of the two metal 
enclosures, with the side alternated between trials to cancel side bias. Then, during the social 
trial (5 minutes unless otherwise specified), the test mouse was reintroduced to the arena and 
allowed to freely explore. Between each mouse, the arena was wiped with Clidox-S. 
“Sniffing times” were collected live during the social trial by a blinded observer trained to 
record the duration that a test mouse spends physically interacting/sniffing the “social” or 
“opposite” enclosures. Videotracking was utilized to collect the total distance moved and 
“chamber times” (in left, middle and right chambers) during social and acclimation trials 
and was congruent with sniffing times (e.g., Fig. 1d/Extended Data Fig. 2e). Chamber times 
for the social trial for all three chamber experiments are provided in Supplementary Table 5. 
As described by Crawley22,62, sociability is either present/intact or absent/impaired, and was 
formally defined as a significant preference to explore (or “sniff”) the social cue over the 
inanimate wire mesh cage by a post-hoc test following a two-way repeated measures 
ANOVA (see Statistics). In general, mice ambulated slightly shorter distances overall during 
the social trial (e.g., Extended Data Fig. 2f) although this was not always the case (e.g., 
Extended Data Fig., 5c). Ube3amKO mice ambulated shorter distances across both trials, 
consistent with previous reports of reduced locomotion63. Distances for both acclimation 
and social trials for all three chamber experiments are provided in Supplementary Table 5. 
For studies involving AAV2-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry virus, approximately 28 days 
following AAV injections, mice received intraperitoneal injections of clozapine-N-oxide 
(CNO, Sigma) dissolved in sterile saline 10 minutes prior to three-chamber testing. To 
demonstrate increased sociability in naive mice (that display preserved baseline sociability), 
an additional 5 minutes long “social” trial was performed immediately after the first. For 
open field testing4, mice were placed into a 60×60 cm arena and freely explored for 10 
minutes. Distance moved and the time spent in the center (a concentric 40×40 cm square) 
was measured by video tracking. For elevated plus maze testing (10 cm arm width, 30 cm 
wall elevation, 55 cm off the ground), mice freely explored for 10 minutes during which arm 
times and distances moved were measured by videotracking. For ultrasonic vocalization 
measurements4, pairs of adult mice were placed into a novel clean plastic container within a 
sound-isolated box for five minutes while the number of ultrasonic vocalizations were 
measured using the Ultravox System (Noldus) connected to Avisoft Pro software (Avisoft 
Bioacoustics). When pairs of females were tested, both mice were of the same genotype/
treatment group (e.g., saline or PTZ) and age but never cage-mates. When male-female pairs 
were tested, test males were paired with independently bred WT age-matched sexually 
mature female mice. In certain experiments, simultaneous video-recordings were collected 
and blindly scored offline to obtain the total time spent physically interacting. The “buried 
food test” was employed to assay olfaction and was performed as described previously64. 
For two consecutive days prior to testing, mice were exposed to a single Teddy Graham 
(Nabisco) within their home cage. Then, 24 h prior to testing, all food was removed from 
their home cages. On the test day, mice were individually placed into a fresh cage filled with

 3cm of fresh bedding and a Teddy Graham buried in one randomly chosen corner. The time 
taken to find and begin to eat the Teddy Graham was recorded. For grooming measures, a 
blinded investigator live-scored the time spent grooming by a mouse placed into a fresh 
clean cage for 10 minutes4. Rotarod testing was performed on an accelerating rotarod (Ugo 
Basile) designed to accelerate from 4 to 40 rpm over five minutes. Mice were given three 
trials per day with a 60 minute inter-trial interval for three consecutive days. Fall latencies 
were obtained through an automated trip detector plate underneath each mouse. When 
multiple behavioral tests were performed on a single cohort of mice, the following order was 
strictly obeyed: three chamber sociability testing → ultrasonic vocalizations → grooming 
→ open field testing / elevated plus maze testing → buried food testing → rotarod testing. 
No more than one test was performed on any given day.
Pentylenetrazole-induced seizures
Pentylenetetrazole (Sigma) dissolved in 0.9% saline was injected intraperitoneally (10 ml/
kg). Mice were then placed individually into fresh cages and no more than 3 mice were 
simultaneously observed for ten minutes by a trained blinded observer. Seizure severity was 
scored as previously described65. Mice received a score of “1” when they displayed 
hypoactivity, defined as a decline in motor activity until the animal came to rest in a 
crouched or prone position with the abdomen in full contact with the cage bottom. A score 
of “2” was assigned if the animal displayed a single or multiple myoclonic jerks. Mice 
scored “3” when they displayed a generalized convulsion characterized by a sudden loss of 
upright posture with diffuse tonic posturing followed by clonic shaking. These episodes 
typically lasted between 20–40s, following which a prolonged period of hypoactivity was 
observed, occasionally interspersed with a few myoclonic jerks. Mice rarely achieved a 
score of “4”, defined as a similar generalized tonic clonic seizure with notable hind limb 
extension. These “maximal” convulsions typically preceded death, which across all 
experiments, occurred at a rate of no more than 0–20% per cohort (typically 0%). Mice 
never displayed more than one convulsion during the observation period. This PTZ protocol 
did not significantly impact general well-being, as reflected by their unimpaired weight gain 
(Extended Data Fig. 6b). Mice were assigned the “highest” score they achieved (i.e., a 
mouse that displayed hypoactivity together with myoclonic jerks scored “2”, whereas a 
mouse that displayed myoclonic jerks that progressed to a generalized convulsion scored 
“3”). While these scores are not continuous variables (and therefore strictly cannot be 
“averaged”), they nevertheless reflect a continuum of the behavioral responses to a PTZ 
injection. To provide a measure of the variability observed, each day’s average scores have 
been provided together with a standard error of the mean.
Stereotaxic surgery and viral vectors
Anesthesia was induced in a chamber with isofluorane/oxygen following which mice were 
placed into a stereotaxic frame fitted with a continuous isofluorane delivery system. A single 
midline vertical scalp incision revealed skull landmarks. Stereotaxic measurements were 
used to make 0.5mm wide burrholes over the entry point for bilateral viral injections 
directed at the VTA (0 deg, AP −3.3 mm, ML +/− 0.4 mm, DV −4.2 mm relative to bregma). 
1 μl of virus was infused at 0.1μl/min through a 33gauge Hamilton needle connected to an 
automated infusion pump. Following each infusion, the needle remained in place for 5

 minutes. The incision was sutured closed and a single injection of 10mg/kg meloxicam 
dissolved in saline was administered intraperitoneally for perioperative analgesia. All 
behavioral measurements were conducted approximately 20 days following surgery 
following which accurate targeting to the VTA was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. 
Electrophysiological assays were conducted at least 30 days after the surgery during which 
VTA sections were also examined for accurate placement. AAV2CreGFP, AAV2GFP, 
AAV2-DIO-GFP, AAV2-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry, and AAV2-EF1α-Dio-hChR2(E123T/
T159C)-EYFP were purchased from the University of North Carolina Viral Vector Core. For 
AAV-hSyn-DIO-Ube3a, the coding sequence of human Ube3a isoform 3 was amplified by 
PCR from Plasmid #37605 (Addgene) using primers to add a SpeI site to the 5′ end and an 
AscI site to the 3′ end. The resulting product was then ligated into NheI and AscI sites of 
the pAAV-hSyn-DIO-EGFP vector, Plasmid #50457 (Addgene). For AAV-hSyn-DIO-Cbln1-
IRES-mCherry, the coding sequence of mouse Cbln1 was amplified from cDNA clone 
MGC:66947 IMAGE:6404555 using primers to add an XbaI site to the 5′ end a BamHI site 
to the 3′ end and was then subcloned into the pLVX-IRES-mCherry vector (Clontech). An 
MluI site 3′ of mCherry was converted to an AscI site using the Q5® Site-Directed 
Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs). The Cbln1-IRES-mCherry cassette was digested 
with XbaI and AscI and subcloned into NheI and AscI sites of the pAAV-hSyn-DIO-EGFP 
vector. To generate AAV-Vglut2-mCherry and AAV-Vglut2-mCherry-2A-Cre, the coding 
sequence of mCherry or mCherry-2A-Cre was amplified from pLM-CMV-R-Cre Plasmid 
#27546 (Addgene) with primers to add a MluI and AscI site to the 5′ end and a HindIII site 
to the 3′ end and then were subcloned into MluI and HindIII of the pAAV-hSyn-DIO-EGFP 
vector. The 1.8 kb promoter region of mouse Vglut2 was amplified from C57BL/6J whole 
brain genomic DNA with primers 5′-TCTTCC ACGCGT 
ACGCACTCCCCTGGTTGATTTAG-3′ and 5′-TCTTCC GGCGCGCC 
TCTTGTAAAGACTGGTGTCCAGCCT-3′, digested with MluI and AscI and subcloned 
into pAAV-mCherry and pAAV-mCherry-2A-Cre. AAV9-hSyn-DIO-Ube3a and AAV2-
hSyn-DIO-Cbln1-IRES-mCherry constructs were sent to the University of North Carolina 
Vector Core for viral particle production. AAV2/9-pVglut2-mCherry and AAV2/9-pVglut2-
mCherry-2A-Cre constructs were sent to the Boston Children’s Hospital Viral Core for viral 
particle production.
Brain slice patch clamp electrophysiology and in vitro optogenetics
Brains were rapidly removed and submerged in an ice-cold choline chloride replacement 
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 126 choline chloride, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 
NaH2PO4, 1.3 MgCl2, 8 MgSO4, 0.2 CaCl2, 20 glucose, and 46 NaHCO3, equilibrated 
with 95% O2/5% CO2. Coronal brain slices containing the nucleus accumbens (300 μm 
thick) were made using a Leica VT1200S microtome (Leica Microsystems). The slices were 
placed in a holding chamber containing ACSF comprised of (mM): 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 
MgSO4, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 25 Glucose, and 26 NaHCO3, equilibrated with 95% 
O2/5% CO2. The slices were maintained at 33°C temperature for 30 minutes and then kept 
at room temperature until studied. To increase viability of neurons in the slices, 5 μM 
glutathione, 500 μM pyruvate, and 250 μM kynurenic acid were added to the choline 
chloride replacement ACSF and ACSF in the holding chamber in all experiments. During 
recording, slices were superfused (2 ml/min) ACSF without glutathione, pyruvate and

 kynurenic. Whole cell recordings were performed from neurons located in the nucleus 
accumbens (NAc) shell under visual control on an upright microscope with differential 
interference contrast and infrared illumination. Patch pipettes were pulled using a P-97 
puller (Sutter Instruments) and filled with (mM): 130 K gluconate, 10 HEPES, 5 NaCl, 1 
MgCl2, 0.02 EGTA, 2 MgATP, 0.5 NaGTP and 10 mM sodium phosphocreatine at a pH of 
7.3 and osmolality of 275 to 290 mOsm. 1 mM Alexa Fluor 568 hydrazide was dissolved in 
internal solution and was backfilled to the tip of the patch pipettes. Filled patch pipettes had 
resistances of 3–5 MΩ. Synaptic currents were recorded in voltage clamp mode by an Axon 
MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Data were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 
10 kHz with DigiData 1440A interface (Molecular Devices) and acquired by Clampex 10.5. 
Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) were identified by their morphology and hyperpolarized 
resting membrane potential. Series resistance was monitored with a 5 mV hyperpolarizing 
step (5 ms). Resting membrane potential and action potentials (APs) were recorded in 
current clamp mode with APs induced by injecting 200 ms of positive currents ranging from 
40 to 400 pA. An optical fiber (200 μm core diameter, 0.2 numerical apertures) was used to 
deliver optical stimulation. The fiber was placed 200 μm from the site of recording and 
coupled to a diode-pumped 473 nm laser (CrystaLaser Company) with stimulus intensity 
controlled from 1 to 30 mW. Light pulse duration (5ms) was controlled by a Master-8 
stimulator and light pulse frequency (0.1 Hz) was determined and triggered by the Clampex 
10.5. Light intensities of 0, 1, 5, and 30 mW were used for input/output experiments with six 
sweeps collected for each. 30 mW laser light was used for maximal stimulation and 
pharmacology experiments, 12 consecutive sweeps were averaged with Clampfit 10.5 to 
determine the light-evoked EPSC amplitude. 30 μM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione 
(CNQX) was used in some studies to block and confirm AMPA receptor currents. 
Spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) were recorded at a holding potential of −85 mV in the 
presence of GABAA antagonist bicuculline (10 μM). sEPSCs were detected and analyzed 
using Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA). Amplitude and area thresholds 
were set to 5 pA and 20 fC, respectively. The peak amplitude and inter-event interval of 
sEPSCs from 60 s episodes were used to generate cumulative probability plots, and the 
statistical significance was determined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Statistics
Sample sizes are shown in figures or legends and were chosen to meet or exceed sample 
sizes typically employed in similar mouse behavioral experiments. For three-chamber 
sociability experiments, “sniffing time” measures were entered into a two-way repeated 
measures ANOVA. F statistics and p values for “interaction effects” between chamber side 
(social versus opposite) or experimental group (various viruses, treatments or genotypes) 
and “main effects” are presented in Supplementary Table 5. When a significant main effect 
in either factor was detected (regardless of the presence of a statistical interaction), a 
Bonferroni post-hoc test was employed to obtain a p-value (adjusted for multiple 
comparisons) comparing the means of sniffing times for social and opposite conditions 
across groups22,62. Thus, asterisks or “ns” (not significant) designations for all figures 
measuring three-chamber sociability represent the results of post-hoc comparisons. For 
experiments involving LoxTBUbe3a mice exclusively (Fig. 3a–i, Extended Data Fig. 8), the 
Holm-Sidak post-hoc test was employed. For all other experiments, an unpaired two-tailed

 Student’s T test was used to compare two groups, and a two-way ANOVA was employed to 
compare means across two or more dependent variables. A two way repeated measures 
ANOVA was utilized for rotarod testing (Extended Data Fig. 5k). Unless otherwise 
specified, data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). p < 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant with ns indicating non-significant, * <0.05, ** <0.01, and
