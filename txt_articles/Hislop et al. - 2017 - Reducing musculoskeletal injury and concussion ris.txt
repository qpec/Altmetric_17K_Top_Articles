ABSTRACT
Background Injury risk in youth rugby has received 
much attention, highlighting the importance of 
establishing evidence-based injury reduction strategies.
Aim To determine the efficacy of a movement control 
exercise programme in reducing injuries in youth rugby 
players and to investigate the effect of programme dose 
on injury measures.
Methods In a cluster-randomised controlled trial, 
40 independent schools (118 teams, 3188 players 
aged 14–18 years) were allocated to receive either the 
intervention or a reference programme, both of which 
were to be delivered by school coaches. The intervention 
comprised balance training, whole-body resistance 
training, plyometric training, and controlled rehearsal of 
landing and cutting manoeuvres. Time-loss (>24 hours) 
injuries arising from school rugby matches were recorded 
by coaches and medical staff.
Results 441 time-loss match injuries (intervention, 
233; control, 208) were reported across 15 938 
match exposure-hours (intervention, 9083; control, 
6855). Intention-to-treat results indicated unclear 
effects of trial arm on overall match injury incidence 
(rate ratio (RR)=0.85, 90% confidence limits 0.61 to 
1.17), although clear reductions were evident in the 
intervention arm for concussion incidence (RR=0.71, 
0.48 to 1.05). When trial arm comparisons were limited 
to teams who had completed three or more weekly 
programme sessions on average, clear reductions in 
overall match injury incidence (RR=0.28, 0.14 to 0.51) 
and concussion incidence (RR=0.41, 0.17 to 0.99) were 
noted in the intervention group.
Conclusion A preventive movement control exercise 
programme can reduce match injury outcomes, including 
concussion, in schoolboy rugby players when compared 
with a standardised control exercise programme, 
although to realise the greatest effects players should 
complete the programme at least three times per week.
INTRODUCTION
The injury risk in youth rugby has received atten-
tion in the mainstream public and sports medicine 
literature1 2 and has prioritised the formulation of 
appropriate preventive measures.3 Musculoskeletal 
injuries and concussion are prominent reasons for 
time loss from sport for adolescent rugby players,4 
5 and significant youth sports injuries, in general, 
have been implicated in long-term disability and 
compromised quality of later life.6 7 Conditioning 
the musculoskeletal system to tolerate external 
forces, through enhancing strength and move-
ment control, has been advocated as means of 
reducing musculoskeletal injury risk, as indicated 
by a growing evidence base that supports using 
multifaceted preventive exercise programmes to 
reduce musculoskeletal injury risk across male 
sports such as basketball8 and soccer.9–11 Moreover, 
cross-sectional associations between neck strength 
measures with concussion risk in young athletes 
invite the possibility that interventions to enhance 
neck strength may reduce concussion risk.12 The 
injury patterns in rugby differ from other team 
sports, owing to a greater frequency of concussion, 
upper body and contact-related injuries,13 14 and 
so it is uncertain if introducing a targeted exercise 
programme can reduce musculoskeletal injuries 
and/or concussion in youth rugby players.
The efficacy of preventive exercise programmes 
is dependent on several factors, of which the 
frequency of programme use (ie, dose) may be one 
such factor.15 Dose–response relationships have 
typically been identified between programme use 
and reductions in knee ligament injury incidence 
in female sportspeople.16 17 Assessing the effects of 
programme dose can be useful in reinforcing the 
outcomes of intervention research and informing 
subsequent implementation attempts.18
The aims of this study were to assess the effi-
cacy of a pre-activity movement control exercise 
intervention to reduce the incidence and burden 
of rugby-related injuries in a schoolboy population 
and to assess the influences of programme dose and 
compliance on injury outcomes.
METHODS
Study design and recruitment
A cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted 
across independent school rugby teams over 
one playing season (August to December 2015). 
The study design was in accordance with the Consol-
idated Standards of Reporting Trials statement,19 
and the trial was registered before recruitment (trial 
registration number: ISRCTN13422001). Study 
procedures were approved by the Research Ethics 
Approval Committee for Health at the University 
of Bath.
Each school was treated as a cluster, within which 
under-15 (U15), under-16 (U16) and under-18 
(U18) teams were allocated to the same trial arm.

A priori sample size calculations were undertaken,20 incorpo-
rating injury data collected from a previous study on injuries in 
schoolboy rugby players.5 To discern a 30% reduction in match 
injury incidence at 80% statistical power, 13 schools per trial 
arm were required. Seven additional schools were recruited in 
each trial arm to account for attrition, yielding a target sample 
of 40 schools. Schools deemed eligible to participate had on-site 
access to physiotherapists or nurses who would treat all rugby-re-
lated injuries. T
wo hundred and twenty schools were identified 
and sequentially contacted in randomised groups of 60 through 
trial invitation letters, emails and direct telephone calls to senior 
members of the sport and rugby programmes until 40 schools 
had provided written informed consent from a member of the 
senior management team to participate in the trial. Schools 
were randomly allocated to the intervention or control groups 
on a 1:1 basis. The randomisation process for both recruitment 
and allocation was completed independently of the research 
team. Schools were briefed that they would receive an exercise 
programme to be delivered by the coaches to their U15, U16 
and U18 teams, but were blinded to their trial arm allocation. 
All U15, U16 or U18 players who participated in training or 
match play at the school were eligible to participate in the trial. 
Coach consent (in loco parentis), player assent and opportu-
nity for parental opt-out (via school–parent mailing lists) were 
sought.
Coaches attended a pre-study workshop (typically 1 
hour 
duration) led by the research team at each school (June to July 
2015), at which they were introduced to either the intervention 
or the control exercise programme and data collection materials, 
in addition to being provided with a practical demonstration of 
the programme. The practical demonstration of the programme 
entailed coaches observing a research team member leading a 
group of youth rugby players (U15, U16 or U18) through a 
session. Coaches across both trial arms received identically 
formatted data collection and programme materials (except for 
exercises). Programme materials included a filmed demonstra-
tion of the exercises (as a DVD), laminated cue cards (images 
and key coaching cues for each exercise) and a booklet detailing 
how to complete individual exercises. A further meeting was 
arranged at all schools during pre-season for members of the 
research team to collect informed assent and baseline anthro-
pometric information (standing height, seated height and body 
mass) from all players involved in the trial.
The exercise programmes being trialled
The process of devising the intervention and control exercise 
programmes have been reported elsewhere.21 Both programmes 
comprised four phases, with progressions occurring via 
increased difficulty and repetition volume of exercises. Phase 1 
was devised for the pre-season period (typically 1–2 
weeks’ dura-
tion). Both programmes progressed to phase 2 on the school 
term commencing in September 2015, with two further planned 
phase progressions occurring every 4 
weeks until the end of the 
study in December. This timing enabled players to master the 
exercises before being introduced to a more advanced phase. 
Progression of the exercises was undertaken at the team level, 
with all players within the same age group teams completing the 
same exercises at the same time. Phase difficulty was offset by 
age group (ie, phase 3 of the U15 programme was similar in 
difficulty to phases 2 and 1 of the U16 and U18 programmes, 
respectively) to maintain a sufficient stimulus for players at an 
appropriate level. Both programmes were intended to take place 
during the first 20 
min of each pitch-based training session and 
match warm-up, and coaches in charge of each team acted as 
delivery agents. Coaches were instructed to use the programme 
materials, particularly the laminated cue cards during sessions, to 
assess movement execution in relation to the specified cues for 
each exercise and to identify movements that could be improved.
The exercise programme allocated to teams in the interven-
tion group integrated balance/perturbation training, resistance 
training, 
plyometric 
training 
and 
controlled 
rehearsal 
of 
sport-spe-
cific landing and cutting manoeuvres with verbal feedback and 
reinforcement of technique from the coach (see online supple-
mentary material). The exercise programme allocated to the 
control cohort was derived from currently regarded best practice 
within schoolboy rugby and featured a running-based warm-up, 
dynamic stretching, controlled wrestling, mobility and speed/
change of direction-related drills (without the specific feedback 
instructions given in the intervention programme). The content 
within both the intervention and control programmes were cate-
gorised into four separate parts (parts A, B, C and D) to aid the 
structure of sessions and compliance reporting. A sample phase 
from the intervention exercise programme has been supplied for 
supplementary reference.
Data collection
The definitions of a reportable injury (incurring a time loss of 
more than 24 
hours), match exposure and training exposure 
(only pitch-based activities) were adapted from the consensus 
statement for injury definitions and data collection procedures 
in rugby union.22 Coaches recorded training exposure (length 
of each training session in minutes, number of players attending 
training session), match exposure (match date, opponent name, 
list of players selected to play in each fixture) and programme 
compliance at each session (completion of programme parts A, 
B, C and D) on weekly paper-based or electronic report forms. 
Programme compliance indicated the proportion of programme 
parts that were completed at the team level across all exposures. 
Coaches started the injury reports by logging the date that the 
injury occurred, the injured player’s trial ID and playing position, 
and the event leading directly to the injury. School medical staff 
recorded the injury location and a diagnosis when players visited 
for treatment. Logging the injury location and diagnosis aligned 
with the first two levels of the Orchard Sports Injury Classifica-
tion System (V
.10).23 Coaches recorded the return-to-play date 
(date of full participation in training or match play). A member 
of the research team visited schools periodically (2–3 
weeks’ 
interval) during the study period to retrieve completed report 
forms and to discuss study progress, but not to promote compli-
ance or fidelity with using the programmes.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were undertaken with IBM SPSS Statistics 
(V
.22.0 for Windows). Trial arm comparisons across baseline 
player characteristics (age, anthropometric characteristics and 
maturity timing) were assessed using linear and logistic regres-
sion. The odds ratio (OR) generated from the logistic regression 
was converted to a proportion ratio to permit analysis via magni-
tude-based inference.24
Intention-to-treat analyses compared injury measures between 
the trial arms for all teams that provided injury and exposure 
data, regardless of returning complete programme compliance 
or dose data. Trial arm comparisons were also undertaken on a 
per-protocol basis with teams that maintained a mean programme 
completion rate of three or more weekly sessions, which repre-
sented a threshold for optimal compliance based on previous 
 on 2 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

findings.25 The effects of intervention-only programme dose 
on injury were assessed by comparing injury measures between 
teams that maintained an average of three or more sessions per 
week with those who averaged completing the programmes 
less than three sessions per week. Overall match injury inci-
dence (injuries/1000 player-hours) and burden (days lost/1000 
player-hours) rates acted as dependent variables, with further 
stratification by injury location and event. All estimations were 
made using generalised linear modelling with a Poisson distribu-
tion, a log-linear link function and offset for hours of exposure 
to generate rate ratios (RR) and 90% confidence limits (90% 
CL) 
for injury incidence and burden values. RR and 90% 
CL were 
assessed against predetermined smallest worthwhile effects in 
injury outcome.26 The smallest worthwhile effects favouring 
the intervention and favouring the control were given as 
RR=0.90 
and RR=1.11, respectively.27 Effects were deemed 
clear if the per cent likelihood that the true effect favoured the 
intervention (RR below 0.90) was greater than 25%, and the OR 
between favouring the intervention and favouring the control 
was greater than 66 (ie, if the likelihood of effect favouring the 
intervention was 25% and the likelihood of effect favouring the 
control was less than 0.5%); otherwise, effects were deemed 
unclear. Effects were qualified against probabilistic terms from 
the following scale: <0.5%, most unlikely; 0.5%–5%, very 
unlikely; 5%–25%, unlikely; 25%–75%, possibly; 75%–95%, 
likely; 95%–99.5%, very likely; >99.5%, most likely.28
RESULTS
From a target population of 220 potentially eligible schools that 
were contacted for recruitment, 40 schools (118 teams, 3188 
players aged 14–18 
years) consented to participate in the trial 
and were randomly allocated to the intervention or control 
group (figure 1). Nine schools and 35 teams dropped out of the

trial, with data collected from 31 schools, 83 teams and 2452 
players used for analysis (intervention, 17 schools, 44 teams, 
1325 players; control, 14 schools, 39 teams, 1127 players). 
Comparisons of baseline player anthropometric characteristics 
between the trial arms are outlined in table 1. Trivial differ-
ences were detected between the trial arms for mean player age, 
stature, body mass or the distribution of players by maturity 
timing (table 1).
Exposure, injury and compliance
The intervention cohort (n=17 
schools, 44 teams) accrued 
37 
346 exposure-hours (match, 9083; training, 28 263), with the 
control cohort (n=14 
schools, 39 teams) reporting 32 
375 expo-
sure-hours (match, 6855; training, 25 520). The intervention 
cohort recorded 233 match injuries (totalling 6499 
days lost) 
and 58 training injuries (1028 
days lost), with the control cohort 
recording 208 match injuries (5907 
days lost) and 54 training 
injuries (1150 
days lost). Overall match and training injury inci-
dence in the intervention cohort was 26/1000 
hours (23–29) and 
2/1000 
hours (2–3), and in the control cohort was 30/1000 
hours 
(27–34) and 2/1000 
hours (2–3), respectively.
Summary injury and exposure results between the trial arms 
are outlined in table 2. Of 441 reported match injuries, 168 
were sustained to the head/neck (intervention, 82; control, 86), 
125 to the upper limb (intervention, 65; control, 60), 113 to 
the lower limb (intervention, 67; control, 46) and 35 to the 
trunk (intervention, 19; control, 16). Of 168 head/neck inju-
ries, 105 were reported as concussion (intervention, 51; control, 
54). Match concussion incidence in the intervention group was 
6/1000 
hours (4–7) and in the control group was 8 (6–10).
Complete compliance data were retrieved from 63 out of 
83 teams (intervention, 32 teams; control, 31 teams). In teams 
who had provided complete compliance information, mean 
programme completion rate across both trial arms was close

to twice per week (intervention, 1.9 sessions/week; control, 
2.0 sessions/week). T
welve out of 63 teams maintained a mean 
weekly programme completion rate of three or more sessions 
(intervention, seven teams; control, five teams). Compliance to 
the exercise programmes (proportion of programme parts that 
were completed) were 69% and 83% 
across the intervention and 
control arms, respectively.
Intention-to-treat analyses
Intention-to-treat analyses on the effect of trial arm (interven-
tion, 17 schools, 44 teams; control, 14 schools, 39 teams) were 
unclear for overall match injuries (incidence RR=0.85, 90% 
CL: 
0.61 to 1.17; burden RR=0.83, 0.58 to 1.18) (figure 2). Effects 
were 
also 
unclear 
for 
contact-related 
injuries 
(incidence 
RR=0.85, 
0.60 to 1.19; burden RR=0.88, 0.60 to 1.29). However, clear 
effects favouring the intervention programme were noted for 
head/neck injuries (incidence RR=0.72, 0.51 to 1.01), upper 
limb injuries (burden RR=0.66, 0.40 to 1.10) and concussion 
(incidence RR=0.71, 0.48 to 1.05).
Per-protocol analyses
Per-protocol trial arm comparisons (intervention, four schools, 
seven teams; control, three schools, five teams) revealed that 
teams completing the intervention programme three times 
or more per week suffered 72% fewer overall match injuries 
(incidence RR=0.28, 0.14 to 0.51), 72% fewer contact-related 
injuries (incidence RR=0.28, 0.14 to 0.56), 50% fewer days lost 
to contact injuries (burden RR=0.50, 0.21 to 1.18), 81% fewer 
upper limb injuries (incidence RR=0.19, 0.07 to 0.50), 70% 
fewer lower limb injuries (incidence RR=0.30, 0.10 to 0.92) 
and 59% fewer concussions (incidence RR=0.41, 0.17 to 0.99) 
than teams that completed the control programme three or more 
times per week (figure 3).
Per-protocol analyses conducted in the intervention arm indi-
cated that teams typically completing at least three sessions per 
week with the intervention programme (four schools, seven 
teams) suffered 39% fewer match injuries (incidence RR=0.61, 
0.42 to 0.88), 48% fewer days lost to match injuries (burden 
RR=0.52, 0.29 to 0.93), 42% fewer match contact injuries 
(incidence RR=0.58, 0.41 to 0.82) and 55% fewer days lost 
to match contact injuries (burden RR=0.45, 0.25 to 0.82) than 
teams that completed the intervention programme fewer than 
three times per week (10 schools, 25 teams). Effects of interven-
tion programme dose were unclear for upper limb injuries, lower 
limb injuries and concussion.
DISCUSSION
This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a movement 
control exercise programme for preventing injury in youth 
rugby players and to assess the effect of programme dose on 
injury measures. Following intention-to-treat analyses, effects

of the trial arm were unclear for overall match injury. Per-pro-
tocol trial arm comparisons under conditions of high dose 
(≥3 weekly programme sessions) revealed clear reductions 
for the intervention arm for overall match injury, contact-re-
lated injury, upper and lower extremity injury and concussion 
incidence values. Moreover, a higher intervention programme 
dose was shown to reduce the incidence and burden of 
overall match injuries and contact injuries compared with 
lower intervention programme doses (<3 weekly programme 
completions).
Intention-to-treat analyses
Intention-to-treat analyses indicated unclear effects of trial 
arm for overall match injury (incidence RR=0.85, burden 
RR=0.83) and match contact injury (incidence RR=0.85; 
burden RR=0.88). The 15% reduction in overall match injury 
incidence in this study is lower than the 41%–56% reductions 
noted in other studies conducted in male basketball and soccer 
players,8 10 11 which may be partly attributed to differences 
between definitions of reportable injuries, programme content, 
or the distribution of injury types and locations between the 
respective sports, that is, proportion of non-contact lower 
limb injuries. However, clear effects favouring the intervention 
exercise programme were noted for head/neck injury incidence 
(incidence RR=0.72) and concussion incidence (incidence 
RR=0.71). Sixty-two per cent of reported head/neck injuries 
in the trial were attributed to concussion, and therefore the 
reductions in head/neck injury incidence were likely because of 
reductions in concussion incidence. Concussion is a priority for 
prevention across contact and collision sports due to potential 
concern over medium-term and long-term player welfare.29 30 
Thus, the substantially reduced concussion incidence across the 
intervention arm is a very promising finding with regards to 
current efforts to reduce the risk of concussion.
Neck strength has been shown to be substantially lower in 
adolescent rugby players when compared with adult players 
despite similar peripheral strength profiles.31 Increased concus-
sion risk is associated with lower neck strength, highlighting this 
characteristic as a potentially modifiable risk factor.12 Enhancing 
neck muscle strength may prevent concussion by improving 
the dissipation of impact forces transmitted to the brain.32 33 
Therefore, it is possible that the neck resistance exercises in 
the intervention exercise programme contributed to reduced 
concussion incidence via this mechanism. Neck pain is a common 
physical complaint among young sportspeople participating in 
collision sports34 35 and may be associated with increased concus-
sion risk.33 Given that acute and cumulative rugby exposure can 
adversely impact neck function,36–38 the neck resistance exercises 
may also have contributed to preserving neck function during 
the playing season,39 in turn reducing concussion incidence.
Upper limb injuries are common in contact sports and can also 
result in substantial time loss in youth rugby players.5 40 Teams 
in the intervention trial arm suffered substantially fewer days 
absence due to upper limb injuries than teams in the control 
arm (burden RR=0.66). Little is known about the underlying 
risk factors and mechanisms for upper limb injuries, and exam-
ples of evidence-based upper limb injury prevention are scarce.41 
Reduced glenohumeral rotation and rotator cuff muscle strength 
imbalances may be modifiable risk factors for shoulder injuries in 
rugby players.42 The intervention programme may have improved 
joint kinematics and force-handling capabilities within the upper 
limb as a result of incorporating resistance and plyometric training 
of upper body regions,43 44 thus implying that reducing upper 
limb injury risk across youth contact sports is possible through 
improving upper limb strength, stability and mobility.
Per-protocol analyses
The lack of clear substantial effects for overall match and 
contact-related injuries following intention-to-treat analyses 
should be considered in the context of dose, which may have 
affected these outcomes. Although mean intervention programme 
dose in this study was higher (1.9 completions per week) than 
has been reported in previous studies (1.3–1.4 completions per 
week),45 46 the level of dose that teams received in the inter-
vention trial arm may have been insufficient to demonstrate a 
clear effect on overall match injuries. Greater effects of preven-
tive exercise programmes may be realised if regularly used at 
least three times per week.25 Trial arm comparisons conducted

Original article
on a per-protocol basis showed that intervention trial arm 
teams that regularly completed the programme more than three 
times per week suffered 72% fewer overall match injuries, 72% 
fewer contact-related injuries, 81% fewer upper limb injuries, 
70% fewer lower limb injuries and 59% fewer concussions 
than control teams with an equivalent dose. When per-protocol 
analyses were conducted within the intervention arm, teams 
that regularly completed the programme over three times per 
week suffered 39% fewer match injuries, 48% fewer days lost to 
match injuries, 42% fewer contact injuries and 55% fewer days 
lost to contact injuries than teams with less than three weekly 
programme completions. Regularly performing a preventive 
exercise programme three times per week over a sustained period 
has been shown to improve markers for neuromuscular control 
and muscle strength in male soccer players.47 Therefore, these 
physiological benefits may explain the enhanced effects noted in 
this study with a high dose of the intervention programme use 
compared with the control programme and a lower dose of the 
intervention programme.
Evidence of a dose–response effect on overall and contact-re-
lated injuries in this study presents wider applications of the 
dose–response effect of preventive exercise programmes, and 
has the potential to inform subsequent implementation attempts 
through identifying a minimum effective dose in this population. 
The collective findings from the intention-to-treat and per-pro-
tocol analyses highlight that teams involved in contact sports can 
obtain benefit from using preventive exercise programmes, but 
more importantly, regular exposure of more than three times per 
week can result in substantial injury risk reduction.
Limitations and future directions
There were several limitations to this study that should be 
acknowledged. First, the research team members that ran the 
pre-trial workshops and conducted pre-season visits were not 
blinded to the programme allocation for each school, creating 
potential bias between the two groups in terms of the processes 
followed and information disseminated at these workshops; 
this was mitigated through use of a unified workshop format. 
Second, individual player compliance was not monitored during 
the study. Results of previous studies have indicated that indi-
vidual player compliance may be a more sensitive measure than 
team compliance in determining the influence of compliance on 
programme efficacy,45 46 but puts considerable strain on coaches, 
and so was not feasible in this setting. Third, it was not possible 
to validate coach compliance reports or to monitor exercise 
fidelity (the quality of performing the exercises) through unan-
nounced visits or observations, given that schools have strict 
policies around access to premises. The fidelity with which teams 
used the programmes is uncertain, but may actually have medi-
ated programme efficacy along with dose and compliance.48
Further work is required to understand the mechanistic bases 
by which the intervention exercise programme reduced injury 
outcomes, particularly in relation to the proposed effects of the 
programme on neck strength and function in reducing concus-
sion incidence, as well as kinematics and force handling capacities 
in the upper limb. Determining efficacy is a crucial step towards 
effecting a public health impact of injury prevention measures 
in rugby, although results of this controlled trial alone are not 
 
sufficient to translate to reducing injuries in ‘real world’ 
contexts.49 50 Further research is required to further under-
stand the contexts into which the exercise programme would 
be implemented, as well as identifying what factors may facil-
itate or inhibit programme use.18 In particular, studies should 
be directed to identifying what factors could facilitate or inhibit 
teams from completing the intervention programme three times 
per week.
CONCLUSION
Although intention-to-treat results highlighted trivial effects of 
the intervention exercise programme on overall match injury 
incidence when compared with the control exercise programme, 
a substantial reduction in overall match injury incidence was 
evident from per-protocol trial arm comparisons under condi-
tions of high programme dose (three or more weekly sessions). 
Notable beneficial effects of the preventive programme on upper 
and lower extremity injuries and concussion incidence also have 
important implications for the reduction of these priority injury 
types in youth rugby.
What are the findings? 
 
► Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that the intervention 
programme substantially reduced upper limb injury burden 
(RR=0.66, 90% CL 0.40 to 1.10) and concussion incidence 
(RR=0.71, 90% CL 0.48 to 1.05) compared with the control 
programme. 
 
► Completing the intervention programme 3 times per week 
led to substantial reductions of 72% in overall match 
injury incidence (RR=0.28, 90% CL 0.14 to 0.51) and 72% 
in contact-related injury incidence (RR=0.28, 90% CL 
0.28 to 0.56) compared with the control programme. 
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future? 
 
► These findings provide encouraging evidence that a 
pre-activity preventive exercise programme can substantially 
reduce injury risk in youth rugby. 
 
► Notable reductions in upper extremity injuries and 
concussion offer promising implications for the prevention of 
these high-risk injury types in young rugby players. 
 
► Findings also outline a minimum effective dose of three 
sessions a week, whereby programme efficacy can be 
optimised.
