AbstrAct
Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cisplatin with pemtrexed or 
vinorelbine and concurrent late course accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy 
(LCAHRT). Patients with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
were randomly assigned to two regimens. The experimental (PP) arm included 
cisplatin, pemtrexed and concurrent LCAHRT based on bilateral lung V20 = 33%. 
The control (NP) arm used cisplatin, vinorelbine with the same radiotherapy protocol. 
The primary endpoint was overall survival. Median survival times were 26.0 months 
(95% CI 23.2 to 28.7 months) and 28.5 months (95% CI 17.1 to 39.9 months) for the 
NP and PP arms, respectively (P = 0.26). Median progression-free survival was 12.5 
months and 17.5 months in the NP and PP arms (P = 0.07). In both arms of the study, 
there were no differences in overall survival between patients with squamous and 
nonsquamous NSCLC. The incidences of grade 3 or 4 toxicity were higher in NP than 
PP arm. With concurrent LCAHRT, pemetrexed/cisplatin was equally as efficacious as 
vinorelbine/cisplatin, but showed a more favorable toxicity profile.
INtrODUctION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related 
deaths worldwide [1]. Only 14% to 20% of patients with 
stage III locally advanced lung cancer are potentially 
suitable for radical resection because of invasion of 
adjacent tissues and/or lymph node metastasis [2, 3]. 
For patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), the combination of systemic 
chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) is now the 
established standard treatment [4]. 
It 
has 
been 
proven 
that 
concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) confers a long-term survival 
benefit at no additional cost over sequential delivery 
of chemotherapy and TRT to NSCLC patients [5-8]. 
Further studies to identify the optimal chemotherapy 
drug combinations concurrent with radiotherapy are in 
progress. A randomized phase III study by the West Japan 
Thoracic Oncology Group (WJTOG) [9], which compared 
third-generation chemoradiotherapy regimens at reduced 
doses with second-generation regimens at full doses, has 
suggested that third-generation regimens significantly 
reduced side effects but failed to prolong patient survival. 
Thanks to its favorable toxicity profile, pemetrexed 
is a promising agent for use in CCRT. Numerous phase I 
studies have shown that pemetrexed administered at its 
 Oncotarget
8423
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
full dose with CCRT is feasible and active [10, 11, 12]. 
The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted 
a phase II study of carboplatin and pemetrexed with or 
without cetuximab in patients with NSCLC. They reported 
that pemetrexed with cetuximab could be recommended 
as safe for use at its full systemic dose in future trials 
with concurrent TRT [13]. In addition, the apparent 
absence of severe toxicity and the high response rates 
when administering pemetrexed with cisplatin (DDP) and 
late course accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy 
(LCAHRT) in our earlier phase I study [14] was also 
encouraging. However, it remains to be determined which 
has the superior efficacy and toxicity profile for patients 
with stage III NSCLC: concurrent chemoradiotherapy 
using pemetrexed or vinorelbine. We therefore designed a 
multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase III clinical trial 
to compare the two third-generation regimens.

Patient characteristics
Between August 2008 and September 2012, 105 
patients were registered in the study. Of those, three 
patients did not receive the protocol treatment because 
they were deemed ineligible for the study as a result of 
being stage IV (n = 1), based on a physician’s decision (n 
= 1) or due to performance status 3 (n = 1). Two patients 
refused to participate in the trial. The trial did not complete 
accrual and closed in October 2012. One hundred patients 
were eligible for analysis (48 for the NP arm and 52 for the 
PP arm). Baseline patient characteristics and demographics 
are listed in Table 1. There were no statistically significant 
differences between the two arms with respect to age, 
performance status, sex, histological subtype and clinical 
stage.
treatment administration
Of the 100 patients, 95 patients completed the 
CCRT, and 87 patients completed at least two cycles 
consolidation chemotherapy. The median total radiation 
dose was 67.5 ± 6.9 Gy, which equaled a median dose in 
2 Gy fractions (EQD2, T, α/β = 8.67 [15]) of 65.9 ± 6.5 
Gy. In the NP arm, the median delivered dose was 66.9 Gy 
(range, 51.2 to 79.2 Gy), with an average delivered dose 
of 66.2 Gy. In the PP arm, the median delivered dose was 
68.0 Gy (range, 54.0 to 80.6 Gy) and the average dose was 
67.1 Gy. There was no significant difference between the 
median radiation dose (P = 0.25) in the NP and PP arms.

treatment-related toxicity, although two patients declined 
to continue because the schedule was too exhausting. 
Three patients were interrupted during chemotherapy. In 
the NP arm, a dose reduction and a delay of treatment were 
given to two patients because of grade 4 hematological 
toxicity. In the PP arm, one patient stopped prematurely 
because of seriousness eczema on his penis. 
short-term outcome
The objective response rates were 91.7% and 88.5% 
in the NP and PP arms, respectively (Table 2). Although 
the response rate in the NP arm was superior to that in the 
PP arm, this difference was not statistically significant (P 
= 0.34).
survival outcome
With median a follow-up time of 29.0 months 
(range, 3-74 months), the median survival time (MST) 
was 26.0 months (95% CI, 23.2 to 28.7 months) in the 
NP arm and 28.5 months (95% CI, 17.1 to 39.9 months) 
in the PP arm (P = 0.26, Figure 2). Median PFS was 12.5 
months (95% CI, 9.48 to 15.5 months) in the NP arm and 
17.5 months (95% CI, 11.6 to 23.4 months) in the PP arm 
(P = 0.07, Figure 3). Although there was no clinically 
significant difference in PFS between the two groups, 
there was a trend in favor of the PP arm. Overall 2-, 3- and 
4-year survival rates were respectively 56.2% (95% CI, 
49.0% - 63.4%), 30.3% (95% CI, 23.3% - 37.3%) and 19.0 
(95% CI, 12.2-25.8) in the NP arm. The corresponding 
values were 53.5% (95% CI, 46.5% - 60.5%), 44.7% (95% 
CI, 37.6% - 51.8%) and 28.1% (95% CI, 19.4%-36.8%) 
in the PP arm. 
The MSTs were 25.0 and 27.0 months for the NP 
arm (P = 0.53), and 25.5 months and not reached for the 
PP arm (P = 0.16). There were no significant differences in 
OS between patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
and non-squamous cell carcinoma (N-SCC) in the two 
arms. Multivariable analysis using treatment, age, KPS, 
sex, histology, stage, and the dose of TRT showed that, 
after controlling for treatment, there were no significant 
differences associated with survival. 
Pattern of relapse
Relapses were noted in 68 of the 100 patients. Table 
3 summarizes the patterns of the sites of first relapse. 
There was no difference between the two arms (P = 0.84).

safety
Treatment-related toxicities are summarized in 
Table 4. The common hematologic side effects in the 
NP and PP arms were leukopenia and anemia. There 
were significantly higher rates of leukopenia and anemia 
in the NP than PP arm. The rates of observed grade 3-4 
leukopenia were 20/48 and 11/52 (P = 0.027) for the 
NP and PP arms, respectively, and the rates of grade 3-4 
anemia were 8/48 and 5/52 (P = 0.047). The incidences 
of other adverse events, including esophagitis, nausea, 
vomiting and thrombocytopenia, did not significantly 
differ. 
In the NP arm, grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 radiation 
pneumonitis (RP) were respectively observed in 31 
(64.5%), 8 (16.6%), 1 (2%) and 0 (0%) of the patients, 
while in the PP arm they were respectively observed in 
21 (40.4%), 10 (19.2%), 0 (0%) and 0 (0%) of patients (P 
= 0.021). One patient in the NP arm died of pulmonary 
hemorrhage. The most notable non-hematological 
adverse event during this phase was esophagitis, which 
developed to grade 2 or worse in 31 patients: 19 (39.6%) 
in the NP arm and 12 (23.3%) in the PP arm. No severe 
late esophageal side effects such as severe stricture or 
perforation were identified.

The results of our phase III trial show no significant 
difference in OS between the NP and PP arms of the study. 
This is the first phase III trial designed to compare the PP 
and NP combinations when administered with concurrent 
LCAHRT to patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. 
From the viewpoint of toxicity, the PP regimen was 
superior to the NP regimen. 
In the context of chemotherapy and concurrent 
TRT for advanced lung cancer, a number of third-
generation regimens have been evaluated to identity the 
optimal chemotherapy regimen [16, 17]. Oh et al [18] 
reported similar outcomes between third-generation 
regimens entailing paclitaxel, docetaxel or gemcitabine 
and cisplatin with concurrent TRT. In addition, Wang 
et al [19] compared weekly paclitaxel/carboplatin and 
cisplatin/etoposide plus TRT, but detected no significant 
favorable trend toward survival with either regimen. These 
two studies did not show third-generation regimens with 
concurrent TRT to be superior with respect to survival or 
toxicity in NSCLC patients.
It was noteworthy that, in the present study, toxicity 
was significantly lower in the PP than NP arm, and there 
was a trend toward increased PFS in the PP arm. The 
published outcomes observed the recent phase III studies 
by Senan et al [20] are consistent with the present study. 
They investigated PP versus etoposide/cisplatin (EP) plus 
TRT in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC and 
observed no significant difference in OS or PFS between 
the PP and EP arms. However, a significantly lower 
incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was observed in the 
PP arm. 
We used LCAHRT on the basis of a prior 
meta-analysis showing that the use of accelerated or 
hyperfractionated radiotherapy led to a significant benefit 
for OS [21]. Repopulation is one of the major factors that 
hyperfractionated and/or accelerated radiotherapy may 
better protect against and so improve OS [22, 23]. In the 
555-patient trial conducted by Senan et al [20], MSTs were 
25.0 and 26.8 months in the EP and PP arms, respectively. 
The median survival time of 28.5 months in the PP arm 
in our trial was superior to that in the treatment arm of 
Senan’s study [20]. This survival difference might be due 
to the use of individualized LCAHRT based on normal 
tissue constraints. Another trial explored the use of NP 
with concurrent individualized accelerated radiotherapy 
based on the normal tissue dose (mean lung dose = 19 Gy) 
[24]. The MST (95% CI) of 25.0 (19.8-30.3) months was 
similar to that in the NP arm of our study.
The overall survival of SCC patients in the PP 
arm in this study was unexpectedly good. Our findings 
suggest that SCC patients treated with PP and LCAHRT 
experience an overall survival period similar to N-SCC 
patients. In the study conducted by Govindan et al [13], 
patients were randomly assigned to pemetrexed and CCRT 
with or without cetuximab. Histological analysis revealed 
no significant difference in OS between the SCC and 
N-SCC patients in the two arms. The study of Gadgeel et 
al [25] confirmed the same results. Because the number

of patients is small in the randomized clinical trials, the 
statistical power for the assessment of survival is low. The 
use of pemetrexed-based CCRT should be studied further 
in a large sample of patients with NSCLC classified based 
on histology types.
The incidence of adverse events noted in the PP arm 
was significantly better than in the NP arm, particularly 
with respect to anemia, leukopenia and pneumonitis 
(χ2 test p < 0.05), though the incidence of grade 3 to 4 
esophagitis was not greater than previously reported [26-
31]. The trial of Jenkins et al [32] confirmed that V20 was 
a useful factor for predicting the risk of the developing 
pneumonitis and can aid the selection of optimal treatment 
plans. The results of our study revealed that based on 
bilateral lung V20 = 33%, severe PR using LCAHRT 
appears to be well tolerated.
The limitations of this study are as follows. The 
study was terminated short of the planned goal because 
of slow accrual and a lack of improvement in survival 
with the pemetrexed/cisplatin treatment. Nonetheless, the 
incidence of grade 3 or worse toxicity in the PP arm was 
markedly lower than in the NP arm. Our study enrolled a 
substantial percentage of patients with SCC. The efficacy 
of pemetrexed in CCRT is superior in patients with 
nonsquamous histology was not known when the study 
was designed. The unplanned subgroup analysis showed 
no significant difference in survival among patients with 
squamous and nonsquamous histology in PP regimen. 
However, due to the small sample number, the study had 
inadequate power to draw definitive conclusions.
In conclusion, our present findings demonstrate that 
concurrent pemetrexed with cisplatin and LCAHRT was 
equally efficacious with a more favorable toxicity profile 
than NP. However, we will need to wait for the final results 
of a larger trial to confirm those benefits for the treatment 
of patients with locally advanced NSCLC.

Patient eligibility
Patients with newly histologically diagnosed, 
unresectable stage III NSCLC were eligible for this 
study (Figure 1). Eligible patients were required to 
have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status of 0-1, to be between 18 and 75 years 
old, and to have lost no more than 5% of their weight over 
the 3 months before enrollment. Laboratory requirements 
were as follows: a leukocyte count of ≥ 4,000/µL, platelets 
of ≥ 100,000/µL, a hemoglobin level ≥ 8 g/dL, a serum 
creatinine level ≤ 1.5 mg/dL, a bilirubin < 1×upper limit 
of normal (ULN), AST and ALT < 2.5×ULN, and alkaline 
phosphatase < 3×ULN. For staging, all patients underwent 
CT of the thorax and abdomen and either a brain CT scan 
or magnetic resonance imaging. A radio isotopic bone 
scan was also performed for all patients. Positron emission 
tomography was strongly recommended for enrollment. 
All the patients signed an informed consent form that 
was approved by their institutional review board prior to 
enrollment. Patients were randomly assigned to the two 
treatment arms after telephoning the trials center. 
treatment
The vinorelbine-cisplatin (NP) regimen entailed 
intravenous (IV) vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 
and IV cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1, 2 and 3; cycles were 
repeated at 21-day intervals. The pemetrexed-cisplatin 
(PP) regimen entailed IV pemetrexed at 500 mg/m2 on 
day 1 and cisplatin at 25 mg/m2 on days 1-3; cycles were 
repeated at 21-day intervals. In the absence of disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity, patients in both arms 
received at least 2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy 
with paclitaxel 45 mg/m2 or vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 on days 
1 and 8 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1, 2 and 3. 
In both arms, chemotherapy dose modifications 
were based on the leukocyte and platelet counts. If 
severe hematologic toxicity occurred on a treatment day, 
chemotherapy was mandatorily held until recovery and 
then resumed at a 75% or 50% dose, as specified. If these 
toxicities did not abate within 6 weeks from day 1 of the 
previous chemotherapy cycle, subsequent cycles were 
stopped.
LCAHRT was administered on the first day of 
chemotherapy, with the RT given in two phases with 
no split. Irradiation was administered as conventionally 
fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) entailing 5×2 Gy per 
week (total dose 40 Gy) in the first phase and LCAHRT 
in the second phase entailing 1.4 Gy twice a day, with 
a minimum interval of 6 hours between fractions. An 
individualized prescribed dose was defined based on 
bilateral lung V20 = 33% (the volume of the whole 
lung receiving > 20 Gy). The dose-volume constraints 
on organs at risk used for plan optimization were as 
following: bilateral lung, V20 = 35%; heart, V65 ≤ 33% 
(the volume of the whole heart receiving ≥ 65 Gy) and 
V45 ≤ 67% (the volume of the whole heart receiving ≥ 
45 Gy); liver, V35 ≤ 50% (the volume of the whole liver 
receiving ≥ 35 Gy), spinal cord, < 45 Gy and esophagus, 
Dmax ≤ 80 Gy). 
All patients were treated with intensity-modulated 
radiotherapy (IMRT). The CBCT scans were prospectively 
acquired weekly in order to register tumor volume 
changes. Treatment planning was based on CT simulation. 
The total gross tumor volume (GTV) consisted of the 
primary tumor and all lymph nodes greater than 1.0 cm in 
short axis measurement on CT, or demonstrated positive 
on a FDG-PET/CT scan. In particular, the target area 
of the primary lesion was delineated in the routine lung 
window, and the mediastinal target area was delineated 
 Oncotarget
8429
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
in the mediastinal window. In patients with atelectasis, 
delineation of GTV was based on fused PET-CT images. 
Regional nodes, including the contralateral hilar, 
contralateral mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes, 
were included in the GTV on the condition that imaging 
manifestations were positive. The clinical tumor volume 
(CTV) was created by adding a 5-mm margin to the GTV 
for squamous carcinoma and a 7-mm margin to the GTV 
for nonsquamous carcinoma. The planning target volume 
(PTV) was defined as the CTV plus an anisotropic margin 
of 0.5 cm for uncertainties of expectation of primary tumor 
movement, respiratory motion and some setup errors. The 
goal was to deliver the prescribed dose to at least 95% of 
the CTV with 95%-105% dosimetric uniformity and 90%-
110% coverage of the PTV, while meeting normal tissue 
constraints according to the respective protocol.
Response evaluation and toxicity
All eligible patients received a physical examination 
and blood chemistry studies once a week and CT scan 
after every two cycles of chemotherapy. The follow-up 
evaluations consisted of a history, physical examination, 
and a thoracic CT performed every 3 months during 
the first 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter. Other 
imaging examinations were obtained when recurrence 
was suspected. The Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) were used to evaluate objective 
response rate (ORR) as complete response (CR), partial 
response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease 
(PD).
Chemotherapy-related toxicity was judged on the 
basis of patients’ complaints and physical examination, 
and was graded chiefly at the discretion of the treating 
physicians, according to the common terminology criteria 
(CTC) version 3.0. 
End-points and statistical analysis
The primary endpoint of this study was overall 
survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were progression-
free survival (PFS) and toxic effects. OS was observed 
from the dates of randomization until death or last follow-
up time. PFS was defined as the time from the dates of 
randomization to the occurrence of disease progression 
(whichever occurred first) or death. ORR was defined 
as the sum of patients with confirmed CR and PR. The 
Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate OS and PFS. 
The log-rank test was used to compare survival curves 
for different groups. Toxic effects were examined using 
the Pearson Chi-Square test. Values of P < 0.05 were 
considered significant, and statistical tests were based on 
a two-sided significance level.
It was projected that the PP regimen would improve 
the 2-year OS probability of 10% from the previous NP 
regimen. Allowing for a 10%-15% ineligibility rate, the 
plan was to accrue a total of 120 patients in each arm. 
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software 
version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
