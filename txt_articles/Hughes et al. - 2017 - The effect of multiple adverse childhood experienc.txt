The effect of multiple adverse childhood experiences on 
health: a systematic review and meta-analysis
Karen Hughes, Mark A Bellis, Katherine A Hardcastle, Dinesh Sethi, Alexander Butchart, Christopher Mikton, Lisa Jones, Michael P Dunne
Summary
Background A growing body of research identifies the harmful effects that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs; 
occurring during childhood or adolescence; eg, child maltreatment or exposure to domestic violence) have on health 
throughout life. Studies have quantified such effects for individual ACEs. However, ACEs frequently co-occur and no 
synthesis of findings from studies measuring the effect of multiple ACE types has been done.
Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched five electronic databases for cross-sectional, 
case-control, or cohort studies published up to May 6, 2016, reporting risks of health outcomes, consisting of substance 
use, sexual health, mental health, weight and physical exercise, violence, and physical health status and conditions, 
associated with multiple ACEs. We selected articles that presented risk estimates for individuals with at least four 
ACEs compared with those with none for outcomes with sufficient data for meta-analysis (at least four populations). 
Included studies also focused on adults aged at least 18 years with a sample size of at least 100. We excluded studies 
based on high-risk or clinical populations. We extracted data from published reports. We calculated pooled odds ratios 
(ORs) using a random-effects model.
Findings Of 11 621 references identified by the search, 37 included studies provided risk estimates for 23 outcomes, 
with a total of 253 719 participants. Individuals with at least four ACEs were at increased risk of all health outcomes 
compared with individuals with no ACEs. Associations were weak or modest for physical inactivity, overweight or 
obesity, and diabetes (ORs of less than two); moderate for smoking, heavy alcohol use, poor self-rated health, cancer, 
heart disease, and respiratory disease (ORs of two to three), strong for sexual risk taking, mental ill health, and 
problematic alcohol use (ORs of more than three to six), and strongest for problematic drug use and interpersonal 
and self-directed violence (ORs of more than seven). We identified considerable heterogeneity (I² of >75%) between 
estimates for almost half of the outcomes.
Interpretation To have multiple ACEs is a major risk factor for many health conditions. The outcomes most strongly 
associated with multiple ACEs represent ACE risks for the next generation (eg, violence, mental illness, and substance 
use). To sustain improvements in public health requires a shift in focus to include prevention of ACEs, resilience 
building, and ACE-informed service provision. The Sustainable Development Goals provide a global platform to 
reduce ACEs and their life-course effect on health.

Introduction
Studies are increasingly identifying the importance of 
early life experiences to people’s health throughout the 
life course. Individuals who have adverse childhood 
experiences (ACEs; during childhood or adolescence) 
tend to have more physical and mental health problems 
as adults than do those who do not have ACEs and 
ultimately greater premature mortality.1,2 ACEs include 
harms that affect children directly (eg, abuse and 
neglect) and indirectly through their living environments 
(eg, parental conflict, substance abuse, or mental 
illness). Physiological and biomolecular studies are 
increasingly establishing how childhood exposure to 
chronic stress leads to changes in development of 
nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, resulting in 
impaired cognitive, social, and emotional functioning 
and increased allostatic load (ie, chronic physiological 
damage).3,4 Thus, individuals who have ACEs can be 
more susceptible to disease development through both 
differences in physiological development and adoption 
and persistence of health-damaging behaviours.
Although studies linking childhood experiences to 
health go back decades,5 examination of multiple ACEs 
enables a better assessment of the breadth of childhood 
adversity and its relation with adult health than does 
examination of single ACEs. The first major ACE study1,6 
examined relations between the number of ACEs 
reported by more than 17 000 individuals in the USA 
and their health as adults. It found that the more ACE 
types that individuals reported, the greater their risks of 
health-harming behaviours (eg, smoking or sexual risk 
taking) and both infectious and non-communicable

diseases (NCDs). Supported by international work to 
standardise measurement of ACEs and their effects on 
health, these findings have since been replicated in 
studies from low-income and middle-income7,8 and 
high-income2,9 countries. However, although previous 
reviews10,11 have collated literature on the health effects 
of any ACE exposure or specific ACE types, no 
systematic attempt has been made to synthesise 
findings from studies of the effect of multiple ACEs 
across multiple outcomes. Consequently, no global 
estimates have been made of the strength of associations 
between multiple ACEs and adoption of health-harming 
behaviours, occurrence of conditions such as obesity 
and chronic health conditions, or risk of further 
exposure to violence in adult years.
In this study, we present findings from a systematic 
review and meta-analysis of studies measuring 
associations between multiple ACEs and health out-
comes. The primary outcomes of interest were pooled 
measures of relations between multiple ACEs and 
health outcomes. Following precedent in the literature,1,6 
we restricted analyses to exposure to at least four types 
of adversity during childhood, with individuals reporting 
no ACEs as the comparator.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
The search strategy of this systematic review and meta-
analysis is summarised in the panel. Searches focused 
on six categories of health outcomes: substance use, 
sexual health, mental health, weight and physical 
exercise, violence, and physical health status and 
conditions. We excluded studies based on high-risk (eg, 
the homeless or those in prison) or clinical populations 
because of often few individuals with low ACE exposure 
in such populations. Included studies met the following 
criteria: cross-sectional, case control, or cohort study, 
using a cumulative measure of at least four ACEs 
spanning both direct (eg, maltreatment) and indirect (eg, 
household dysfunction) types, focused predominantly on 
adults aged at least 18 years, a sample size of at least 100, 
and reported odds ratios (ORs), comparable statistics 
(hazard ratios or prevalence ratios), or data to enable 
their calculation for a health outcome. We also excluded 
outcomes with fewer than four studies reporting results 
suitable for meta-analysis. The initial literature search 
was done by two reviewers (KH and KAH), who then also 
retrieved and independently screened full-text articles. 
Conflicts over inclusion were resolved through discussion 
with MAB. Data were extracted by one reviewer (KH) and 
checked by two others (KAH and MAB).
Data analysis
Included articles were independently assessed for quality 
by two reviewers (KH and KAH) using criteria based on 
the standard principles of quality assessment.12 Studies 
received a point for each quality criterion that they met, 
for a maximum score of 7
. For each article, we extracted 
data for study type, setting, participants, ACEs, and 
outcomes. We extracted ORs or equivalent measures for 
participants with at least four ACEs versus those with 
none. When such data were not published, we included 
studies when adequate information was available to 
allow their calculation, including sample sizes within 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Previous reviews have synthesised evidence for the long-term 
health effects of individual adverse childhood experience (ACE) 
types. However, ACEs often cluster in children’s lives and a 
growing body of research is identifying cumulative relations 
between multiple ACEs and poor health. Initial evidence of this 
relation was published in the 1990s. Since then, an increasing 
number of studies have used similar methods to identify 
how multiple ACEs affect health-harming behaviours 
and development of health conditions, including 
non-communicable diseases.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, no previous attempt has been made to 
synthesise evidence for the risks of poor health associated with 
multiple ACEs across various health-related behaviours and 
conditions. We found that individuals with at least four ACEs were 
at increased risk of all outcomes examined. Associations were 
weak or modest for physical inactivity, overweight or obesity, and 
diabetes (ORs of less than two), moderate for smoking, heavy 
alcohol use, poor self-rated health, cancer, heart disease, and 
respiratory disease (ORs of two to three), strong for sexual risk 
taking, mental ill health, and problematic alcohol use (ORs of 
more than three to six), and strongest for problematic drug use 
and interpersonal and self-directed violence (ORs of more than 
seven)
Implications of all the available evidence
This systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the 
pervasive harms that ACEs place on health throughout the 
life-course and the importance of addressing the various 
stressors that can occur in children’s lives, rather than limiting 
attention to any one type. Although further work is required to 
establish causality, the strong relations between multiple ACEs 
and poor health suggest that a reduction in ACEs and building of 
resilience to enable those affected to avoid their harmful effects 
could have a major effect on health. International resolutions, 
including the Sustainable Development Goals, provide crucial 
opportunities to address ACEs and our findings offer key 
information to advocate and inform development of more 
sustainable life-course approaches to health and health care than 
at present.

each ACE category and adequate ACE categories for 
recalculation of pertinent ORs, linear relationships 
between ACE counts and ORs, or changes in prevalence 
with ACE count. One article13 combined data from eight 
studies; for this article, original data were available to us 
because we were authors of the article, allowing ORs to 
be calculated for each sample. However, our study was 
not 
an 
independent-participant-data 
meta-analysis. 
When multiple studies reported data for the same 
outcome and sample, we included one study on the basis 
of largest sample size or data presentation (closest fit to 
study requirements).
We calculated pooled ORs with 95% CIs for the risk of 
health outcomes among individuals with at least four 
ACEs (vs no ACEs) using a random-effects model in 
StatsDirect version 2.8.0. When ORs were presented at a 
subgroup level within samples, we pooled ORs before 
analysis. We used the I² statistic to estimate the effect of 
heterogeneity among pooled studies. We explored risk of 
publication bias using the Begg-Mazumdar and Egger 
tests and visual inspection of funnel plots when sufficient 
studies were included in the meta-analysis (at least 
ten samples; appendix). We generated forest plots 
showing ORs and 95% CIs for each study and the overall 
random-effects pooled estimate. We did sensitivity 
analyses by excluding outlying studies (so that study 
95% CIs did not overlap those of pooled measures). We 
further explored potential sources of heterogeneity by 
visual inspection of data and forest plots and, when 
possible (for outcomes with at least ten samples and high 
heterogeneity between estimates), by meta-regression. 
We did univariate analyses using Stata version 14 to test 
the individual association of the following covariates 
(when relevant) with pooled estimates: sample size, 
country income level (low-income or middle-income vs 
high-income), ACEs measured (fewer than ten vs ten or 
more), sample age range (old [age ≥35 years] vs other), 
outcome timeframe (recent vs lifetime), quality score 
(<5 vs ≥5), OR data (adjusted vs unadjusted), and data 
collection point (past decade [2006 onwards] vs older 
[pre-2006]).

Results
From a total of 11 621 references identified through the 
literature search, full-text copies of 2334 (20%) articles 
were retrieved and screened; 194 (8%) of these articles 
were considered for inclusion, with 37 (19%) articles1,2,6–9,13–43 
selected to contribute to the review, with a total of 
253 719 participants (figure, table 1). 21 used population 
samples from the USA,1,6,14–32 seven used samples from 
the UK,2,9,33–37 two used samples from Finland,38,39 and one 
study each used samples from Canada,40 China,41 
New Zealand,42 the Philippines,8 Saudi Arabia,7 and 
Sri Lanka.43 One article13 included data from eight studies 
done 
in 
Albania, 
Latvia, 
Lithuania, 
Macedonia, 
Montenegro, Romania, Russia, and Turkey; we treated 
these samples separately in analyses. Most studies were 
done in high-income countries, with nine samples from 
middle-income countries and none from low-income 
countries. 26 articles used data from cross-sectional 
studies and 11 used data from cohort studies; however, all 
studies used retrospective, self-reported ACEs. 21 studies 
used general population (predominantly household) 
samples, with other samples from primary care, 
education, community, military, and workplace settings. 
Sample sizes ranged from 210 to 53 998 individuals, with 
most studies covering broad age ranges and both sexes, 
although young, old, and single-sex samples were 
included. 144 725 (57%) of 252 467 participants across 
all studies reported at least one ACE and 31 795 
(13%) of 244 979 reported at least four.
The mean number of ACEs measured was nine, with 
most studies using a similar core set (table 2), and all 
using a similar timeframe for exposure (from up to age 
16 years to up to age 18 years). Prevalence of zero ACEs 
ranged from 12% to 67% and prevalence of at least 
four ACEs ranged from 1% to 38% (table 1). Included 
outcomes and associated definitions are shown in table 3,

along with the number of studies, samples, and countries 
for each outcome.
Pooled ORs for individuals with four or more ACEs (vs 
individuals with no ACEs) for each outcome are 
presented in table 4. Corresponding forest plots are 
provided in the appendix. Funnel plots showing risk of 
publication bias for outcomes with at least ten samples 
are also given in the appendix. Smoking, alcohol use, and 
drug use ORs ranged from 2·20 (95% CI 1·74–2·78) for 
heavy alcohol use to 10·22 (7·62–13·71) for problematic 
drug use, all with high heterogeneity between estimates 
(except for problematic drug use, which had low 
heterogeneity). Although statistical tests were non-
significant, visual assessment of the funnel plot indicated 
that smaller studies tended to report greater risk of 
smoking than did larger studies (appendix). Despite 
variation in outcome measurement for heavy alcohol use 
(table 3), this variation had no visible effect on study 
estimates. We did not note any evidence of reporting 
biases for illicit drug use (appendix).
Pooled ORs for sexual health outcomes ranged from 
3·64 (95% CI 3·02–4·40) for multiple sexual partners to 
5·92 (3·21–10·92) for sexually transmitted infections 
(table 4). Heterogeneity between estimates was low for 
multiple sexual partners and high for other outcomes. 
For teenage pregnancy, four studies9,33–35 had measured 
unintended teenage pregnancy and these studies 
reported higher estimates than did those measuring any 
teenage pregnancy8,14,21 (appendix). For early sexual 
initiation, visual assessment of the funnel plot suggested 
that small studies showing significant effects were 
missing (appendix).
Physical inactivity had the weakest relationship with 
multiple ACEs (table 4). We noted moderate heterogeneity 
between estimates, but no evidence of reporting biases 
(appendix). For overweight or obesity, the pooled OR was 
slightly higher, with high heterogeneity between 
estimates. Higher ORs were reported by studies using 
higher body-mass indices (appendix). We noted an about 
four-times higher risk in individuals with at least four 
ACEs across the three indicators of mental distress or 
disorders (table 4). Heterogeneity between estimates was 
low for low life satisfaction and high for anxiety and 
depression. For anxiety, estimates were lower for studies 
measuring more recent anxiety than for those measuring 
longer-term anxiety (appendix). We did not identify this 
difference among estimates for depression, with no 
evidence of asymmetry in the funnel plot (appendix).
Pooled ORs were 7·51 (95% CI 5·60–10·08) for 
violence victimisation and 8·10 (5·87–11·18) for violence 
perpetration (table 4). Heterogeneity was moderate 
between estimates. Suicide attempt had the strongest 
relation with ACEs. However, five of the seven samples 
comprised students aged 18–25;13 pooling of the 
remaining two samples8,18 resulted in an OR of 12·53 
(6·71–23·37; appendix). Across the five chronic diseases 
examined, the lowest pooled OR was for diabetes and the 
highest was for respiratory disease. Other diseases had 
between a two-times and three-times increase in odds 
with at least four ACEs (table 4). Heterogeneity was low 
between estimates pooled for all chronic diseases. 
A similar increase in risk was identified for poor self-
reported health, with low heterogeneity. 
We assessed studies against seven quality criteria 
(table 1). Summed quality scores ranged from 2 to 7, with 
three articles obtaining the maximum 7 points. 11 articles 
reported on studies that had not used random or whole-
population approaches. All included studies are likely to 
be affected by bias given relations between ACEs and 
harms that remove people from population surveys 
(eg, homelessness, institutionalisation, and premature 
death). Thus, studies scored positively if they did not 
appear to include further bias in their recruitment 
strategies, with 11 articles not meeting this criterion. All 
articles used an appropriate control group and all but 
four used validated or clearly defined ACE measurement 
tools. 15 had response rates of less than 50% and 
although only four did not adequately describe study 
participants, 34 provided no information about non-
participating individuals. 
Sensitivity analyses (excluding outlying studies) 
reduced pooled ORs for physical inactivity, diabetes, 
heavy alcohol use, smoking, and illicit drug use and 
increased those for early sexual initiation, depression,

problematic alcohol use, and suicide attempt (table 4). 
We identified no outliers for other outcomes. For physical 
inactivity, both outlying studies were student samples, 
with estimates tending to be higher among such samples 
than among general population samples. For problematic 
alcohol use, the outlying study used a past year 
measurement (vs lifetime elsewhere). We identified no 
clear explanatory factors for other outcomes.
We did meta-regression for smoking, problematic 
alcohol use, illicit drug use, early sexual initiation, and 
depression. We noted no significant relationships 
between ORs and any measured covariate for illicit drug 
use, problematic alcohol use, or depression (appendix). 
For smoking, studies focusing on old participants 
(≥35 years) reported lower odds of smoking than did 
those including general or young samples (β=–0·54; 
se[β]=0·26; p=0·05). For early sexual initiation, studies 
measuring fewer ACEs reported significantly higher 
odds (β=–0·58; se[β]=0·22; p=0·03).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the first to synthesise 
evidence for the effect of multiple ACEs and measure the 
relative magnitude of associations with many of the 
lifestyle behaviours and health conditions that challenge 
public health globally. For all outcomes examined, pooled 
ORs indicated increased risk among individuals with at 
least four ACEs compared with those reporting none.

Associations were weak or modest for physical inactivity, 
overweight or obesity, and diabetes; moderate for 
smoking, heavy alcohol use, poor self-rated health, 
cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease; strong for 
sexual risk taking, mental ill health, and problematic 
alcohol use; and strongest for problematic drug use and 
interpersonal and self-directed violence. We found 
considerable heterogeneity between estimates for almost 
half of the outcomes.
This study supports substantially increased health 
risks to adults who report multiple ACEs, but others 
identify how having such ACEs is common globally.44 
A billion children aged 2–17 years were estimated to have 
been victims of violence worldwide in 2014.45 Across the 
east Asia and Pacific region, the health consequences 
of child maltreatment have been estimated to cost 
around 2% of gross domestic product.46 Global estimates 
of the prevalence and costs of many other ACEs among 
children, such as witnessing of domestic violence, are 
not yet available. Despite accumulating knowledge about 
the lifelong effects of ACEs, their prevention and the 
development of resilience and support for those affected 
have been slow to move up political agendas. 
International attention is increasingly focusing on 
prevention 
of 
violence 
against 
children, 
often 
emphasising protection of girls.47 Although girls are 
especially vulnerable to certain ACEs (eg, sexual abuse), 
both sexes are routinely victims of multiple ACEs and 
both feel their long-term effects.48 In fact, the high 
prevalence of ACEs combined with their effect on life-
course health suggests a substantial but largely hidden 
contribution to Global Burden of Disease estimates, 
which include childhood sexual abuse, yet not many 
other ACEs.49 Thus, smoking and alcohol use are leading 
risk factors for burden of disease,49 and in this study, 
individuals who had had at least four ACEs were more 
than twice as likely to be current smokers or heavy 
drinkers and almost six times as likely to drink 
problematically than were those who had had no ACEs. 
Consistent with such elevated risks, NCDs including 
respiratory disease, diabetes, cancers, and heart disease 
(the leading cause of death globally50), were also 
substantially more likely in those with at least four ACEs 
than in those with none.
Most studies included in this systematic review and 
meta-analysis were done in high-income countries, with 
nine samples from middle-income countries and none 
from low-income countries. The World Mental Health 
Surveys across 21 countries found little variation in ACE 
prevalence between country income groups, with 
38–39% of participants reporting at least one ACE and 
the prevalence of at least four ACEs being 2–3%.51 These 
levels are lower than those measured by studies in this 
systematic review and meta-analysis, with 57% of 
participants across all studies reporting at least one ACE 
and 13% reporting at least four. Little is known about 
how ACEs predict health outcomes in low-income, 
high-violence settings, where exposure to adversity is 
widespread across the life-course. However, evidence 
suggests that ACEs are associated with substance abuse, 
mental illness, and HIV risk in such settings.52
To date, efforts to prevent NCDs, for instance, 
have focused predominantly on tackling of proximal 
determinants (eg, behavioural modifications, advertising, 
or pricing).53 Sustained prevention gains might require a 
shift in focus to include the early drivers of poor health. 
Policies that capture the environmental and societal 
causes of adversity in childhood offer new opportunities 
to address ACEs rather than just their consequences. 
Specifically, through the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, countries have committed to action to

meet 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
by 2030. Although several SDGs (eg, Goal 5 [gender 
equality] and Goal 16 [peace and justice]) address violence 
directly, many others support focus on broad ACEs and 
their risk factors (eg, Goal 3 [good health and wellbeing], 
Goal 4 [quality education], and Goal 10 [reduced 
inequalities]). Crucially, the SDGs also place major focus 
on early childhood development as a means of securing 
lifelong health and provide strong political endorsement 
and a multisectoral framework for this approach.54
Along with the outcomes covered in this analysis, 
studies are now identifying associations between mul-
tiple ACEs and broad harms to life prospects, including 
education, employment, and poverty.55 Strengthening 
understanding of the combined effect of ACEs across 
multiagency priorities should catalyse multidisciplinary 
prevention focused on early intervention. Thus, work to 
address a single ACE in children exposed to many might 
have little effect,51 with treatment and prevention of many 
health conditions requiring multiple underlying ACEs to 
be addressed. Collaborative, trauma-informed services 
can address the various adversities that affect individuals 
and families across the life course, providing integrated 
services to support individuals and reduce the likelihood 
that their own children in turn will be affected by ACEs. 
A body of evidence suggests that many different agencies 
can contribute to prevention of ACEs and reduction of 
their effects.56,57 In health settings, for example, primary 
prevention can be supported through maternity and 
home visiting services that strengthen parenting skills58 
and screening of families for risk factors for ACEs as part 
of routine child health care, providing support and 
referral.59 Screening of adult patients for a history of 
ACEs can help both patients and professionals 
understand the underlying causes of health problems 
and enable better-informed treatment options than 
without this approach.60 ACE-informed practice can be 
developed across multiple settings, including schools, 
criminal justice agencies, and social care. Although 
eradication of ACEs remains aspirational, development 
of children’s personal resilience to enable them to 
overcome adversity and avoid its harmful effects is 
crucial. Resilience programmes to develop problem 
solving and coping skills, for example, can be delivered 
universally in schools and tailored to meet the needs of 
vulnerable children in youth justice, social services, and 
community settings.57,61
This systematic review and meta-analysis has several 
limitations that could contribute to heterogeneity 
between 
study 
estimates. 
All 
included 
studies 
incorporated retrospective ACE reports, which could be 
affected by recall or reporting biases, although retro-
spective reports of major, easily defined ACEs are deemed 
to have acceptable psychometric properties.62,63 The 
number and types of ACEs recorded by studies varied 
and although summing of ACEs is a recognised 
approach,1,9,51,63 it does not account for potential variations 
in effects of different combinations of ACEs. Equally, 
although most studies measured ACEs at any point in 
childhood or adolescence (typically <18 years of age), the 
approach does not account for variation in age at or 
length of exposure. Furthermore, although many risk 
estimates controlled for confounding factors (mainly 
sociodemographics), such factors varied and some 
studies included no such adjustments. Genetic variation 
and environmental risks (eg, drinking during pregnancy 
or parental smoking), which are likely to influence 
relations between ACEs and health, were largely 
unmeasured. These limitations suggest a need for 
greater standardisation in ACE studies, and work to 
support this standardisation has already begun,64 with 
many studies now using consistent measurement and 
analytical approaches. However, our criteria also meant 
that studies were excluded because of alternative data 
analysis methods (eg, analysis of the World Mental 
Health Surveys51). A strength of our systematic review 
and meta-analysis is that it highlights consistency 
between studies in the links between exposure to 
multiple ACEs and poor health, despite likely variation in 
type and extent of exposure. Further work to synthesise 
dose-response relations between ACEs and poor health 
and better understand the relative effects of specific ACE 
types and combinations are needed to better inform 
effective targeting of prevention.
We focused on studies in community settings, which 
are likely to exclude those with the most complex health 
problems (eg, homeless populations) and those who 
have already had ACE-related premature mortality. 
Interpretation of results is also challenged by variation in 
measurements within grouped outcomes and in the 
prevalence of included outcomes, with rarer outcomes 
(eg, suicide attempt) less well covered by population 
surveys than those such as smoking. Furthermore, in the 
case of prevalent outcomes like smoking, increased odds 
will represent substantial increases in absolute risk, 
whereas increased odds for rare outcomes represent 
small increases in absolute risk. Included outcomes 
probably also differ in validity, with difficulties in 
measurement of physical inactivity, for example, 
potentially contributing to its low association with 
multiple ACEs in this study. Finally, this study was only 
able to measure associations; biomedical evidence is 
increasing to support plausible causal relations between 
childhood trauma and poor health, with studies 
identifying neurological, hormonal, immunological, and 
epigenetic changes in those exposed to ACEs.3,65,66 Future 
studies would benefit from designs that allow stronger 
causal inference and control for factors that attenuate or 
amplify observed relations.
This systematic review and meta-analysis identifies the 
pervasive effects that childhood adversity can have on 
health across the life course, with exposure to multiple 
ACEs affecting all 23 of the health outcomes examined, 
including some of the leading causes of the global

burden of disease. Outcomes showing the strongest 
relations with multiple ACEs (violence, mental illness, 
and problematic substance abuse) can represent ACEs 
for the next generation (exposure to parental domestic 
violence, mental illness, and substance use) and thus are 
indicative of the intergenerational effects that can lock 
families into cycles of adversity, deprivation, and ill 
health. Although research into ACEs is far from 
complete, a compelling case exists for increased inter-
national focus on prevention of ACEs, development of 
programmes to bolster resilience, and implementation 
of policies that support a sustainable life-course approach 
to health.
