AbstrAct
Background Little is known about patient/family 
comfort voicing care concerns in real time, especially 
in the intensive care unit (ICU) where stakes are high 
and time is compressed. Experts advocate patient and 
family engagement in safety, which will require that 
patients/families be able to voice concerns. Data on 
patient/family attitudes and experiences regarding 
speaking up are sparse, and mostly include reporting 
events retrospectively, rather than pre-emptively, to try 
to prevent harm. We aimed to (1) assess patient/family 
comfort speaking up about common ICU concerns; (2) 
identify patient/family-perceived barriers to speaking up; 
and (3) explore factors associated with patient/family 
comfort speaking up.
Methods In collaboration with patients/families, we 
developed a survey to evaluate speaking up attitudes and 
behaviours. We surveyed current ICU families in person 
at an urban US academic medical centre, supplemented 
with a larger national internet sample of individuals with 
prior ICU experience.
Results 105/125 (84%) of current families and 
1050 internet panel participants with ICU history 
completed the surveys. Among the current ICU families, 
50%–70% expressed hesitancy to voice concerns about 
possible mistakes, mismatched care goals, confusing/
conflicting information and inadequate hand hygiene. 
Results among prior ICU participants were similar. 
Half of all respondents reported at least one barrier to 
voicing concerns, most commonly not wanting to be a 
’troublemaker’, ’team is too busy’ or ’I don’t know how’. 
Older, female participants and those with personal or 
family employment in healthcare were more likely to 
report comfort speaking up.
Conclusion Speaking up may be challenging for ICU 
patients/families. Patient/family education about how 
to speak up and assurance that raising concerns will 
not create ’trouble’ may help promote open discussions 
about care concerns and possible errors in the ICU.
IntroductIon
Although patients and families are increas-
ingly considered part of the ‘care team’ 
and encouraged to participate in care and 
in safety,1–3 little is known about patient 
and family comfort with voicing concerns 
in real time to clinicians. Yet fostering 
comfort for patients and families to 
voice concerns is central to patient-cen-
tred care,4 including understanding the 
risks and benefits of care and partici-
pating in shared decision-making and 
informed consent. In addition, speaking 
up about care concerns may contribute to 
patient safety as part of an overall safety 
culture.5 For example, families—vigilant 
stakeholders—may be the first to detect 
a change in a patient’s clinical status. 
Also, as the ‘common thread’ uniting care 
encounters, patients and families may 
improve continuity of care among team 
members, or convey key information that 
clinicians may have overlooked.6 Finally, 
patients and families can detect errors, 
even those not apparent to clinicians.7–10 
Supporting patients and families to voice 
concerns may be particularly important 
in the intensive care unit (ICU),11 which 
provides high-intensity, high-acuity, error-
prone and preference-sensitive care to 
millions of patients annually, amounting 
to 13% of hospital costs and 4% of 
national health expenditures in the USA.12 
But voicing concerns in the ICU can be 
problematic for patients and families: the 
physical environment may be perceived 
as strange or dangerous, patients are at 
high risk of death, power asymmetries are 
extreme, multiple clinicians and teams are 
involved, and the complexity of care may 
be overwhelming. Patients and families 
may hesitate to confront clinicians—the 
individuals they rely on for treatment—
and they may fear negative repercussions 
if they speak up.13 14 Acute illness may also 
decrease comfort voicing concerns.15 16

Original research
At the same time, staffing ratios may enable closer 
relationships between families and clinicians, with 
unpredictable effects on speaking up. Holding one’s 
voice may have traumatic consequences for patients 
and families, including guilt and loss stemming from 
preventable errors or deaths, suffering unwanted care, 
poor quality of dying, or psychological injury as a part 
of post-ICU syndrome.17–21
The potentially devastating effects of ‘silence’ when 
speaking up is needed22 23 have led to focused atten-
tion on speaking up as part of safety culture.24 25 
Although speaking up among clinicians improves team 
performance,26 27 outcomes have been less thoroughly 
studied for patients and families.28–32 Nonetheless, 
empowering patients and families to ‘stop the line’ 
when something is wrong seems prudent, particu-
larly given their unique knowledge of the patient, 
accounts of families who ‘knew something was not 
right’ before a harmful event,14 33 and the poten-
tial to prevent catastrophic outcomes such as serious 
medication errors.34 Safety and engagement experts 
identify assessment of patient and family comfort 
with speaking up as a critical next step in improving 
safety culture,4 35 building on recent metrics devel-
oped for clinicians25 36 and initiatives that encourage 
patients and families to raise concerns about possible 
care breakdowns and mistakes.37–39 While conceptual 
models of voice and silence have proven multidimen-
sional and complex,25 40 41 factors influencing voice 
among professionals have been described.42 43 These 
include hierarchy, lack of experience or skills speaking 
up, quality of relationships among involved persons, 
clinical environment characteristics, psychological 
safety, and personal factors such as assertiveness.43–49 
Although several of these factors may apply to patients 
and families, other unique issues may play a role, and 
this question is not well studied. We therefore aimed 
to assess patient/family comfort voicing concerns in 
a high-stakes, dynamic environment. We approached 
the problem in a collaborative manner that included 
members of our patient and family advisory council 
(PFAC) as partners from beginning to end, working to 
address three core research questions:
1. What proportion of ICU patients/families report feeling 
comfortable voicing concerns about common ICU issues?
2. What are the most common patient and family self-re-
ported barriers to voicing concerns in the ICU?
3. What patient/family factors are associated with greater 
likelihood of self-reported comfort voicing concerns in 
the ICU?
Methods
Participants
Current ICU family cohort
From July 2014 to February 2015, we conducted a 
survey of adult family members of patients admitted 
to the ICU at our north-east US urban academic 
medical centre. The survey was administered by 
trained research assistants who visited the ICUs and 
ICU waiting rooms hourly between 09:00 and 18:00 
on weekdays to identify available family members who 
met the eligibility criteria: adults (ages 18–89) living in 
the USA who could communicate in English and had a 
loved one admitted to the ICU. Family members who 
agreed to participate were given an electronic tablet on 
which to complete the survey independently, and the 
research assistant returned to collect the tablet when 
the participant finished.
ICU admission history—internet panel participants
Because our current ICU family cohort was limited 
to a single hospital in the north-east USA, we iden-
tified a national internet cohort of individuals with 
self-reported ICU experience within the last 10 years, 
to whom we administered the same survey. Given 
expected differences related to mode of administra-
tion, acuity of exposure to the ICU experience and 
broader cultural differences, we did not compare 
the two cohorts statistically: the internet cohort was 
intended to qualitatively confirm and extend our find-
ings from the current ICU family cohort, with a more 
feasible approach to enrolment of a large number of 
respondents. The internet-based survey was adminis-
tered via Qualtrics (Provo, Utah), an internet survey 
firm that uses standard empanelment procedures to 
recruit sample populations for marketing, quality 
assurance and medical research.50
survey design
We developed the survey instrument collaboratively 
with representatives from the medical centre’s PFAC 
and a multidisciplinary team of experts in communi-
cation, patient engagement, ICU care, clinical research 
and patient safety. In this paper, we report the results 
of survey items focused on patient and family comfort 
voicing concerns in the ICU setting. Our detailed, iter-
ative survey development methodology, along with 
the results of other items and/or instruments admin-
istered during the overall survey, has been published 
elsewhere.51 We conducted cognitive testing of survey 
items with PFAC members and iteratively improved 
the survey via seven subsequent reviews by the PFAC 
and content experts. Several attention questions were 
built into the final survey, such that responses with 
incorrect answers were excluded. Surveys with more 
than 20% missing items were also excluded.
With input from our PFAC members, we developed 
survey items evaluating patient and family comfort 
voicing concerns about eight common ICU topics, 
such as medications, conflicting or confusing infor-
mation, and concern about a possible mistake. We 
asked respondents the extent to which they would 
feel comfortable speaking up in these situations using 
a 4-point Likert-style item ranging from ‘very uncom-
fortable’ to ‘very comfortable’. We also asked why 
participants might hesitate to voice concerns, using

Original research
items identified from a literature review and discus-
sions with patient/family advisors.5 17–22 52 While some 
clinical scenarios call for voicing concerns as part of 
patient-centred care, others, such as notifying clini-
cians about possible mistakes, involve voicing concerns 
as part of safe care. We use the term ‘speaking up’ for 
simplicity when referring to the collective comfort with 
voicing concerns to the care team about several aspects 
of ICU care, some of which include safety issues. We 
collected demographic information including age, sex, 
ethnicity, education, and whether the participant, or 
a close friend or family member, works in healthcare. 
Relevant portions of the survey instrument are avail-
able in the online supplementary appendix A.
statistical methods
Using SAS V
.9.3, we calculated the descriptive statistics 
of the data. For the first research question—patient and 
family comfort voicing concerns in eight ICU conver-
sations—we conducted univariate analysis of the eight 
speaking up items. For this analysis, we dichotomised 
‘very comfortable’ versus remaining responses since all 
other answer choices indicated some degree of hesi-
tancy to voice concerns. We analysed responses to each 
item separately to assess any variance in patient-re-
ported and family-reported comfort voicing concerns 
about each of these ICU conversations.
For the second research question—barriers to voicing 
concerns—we used descriptive statistics to summarise 
the number of and the most common barriers selected 
by participants.
For the third research question—patient and family 
factors associated with comfort voicing concerns—we 
first assessed the possibility of summarising the eight 
speaking up items (measured on a 4-point Likert-style 
scale) as a single ‘Speaking Up’ score through principal 
component analysis (PCA) and calculation of Cron-
bach’s alpha to test internal consistency. On PCA of the 
speaking up items, only the first principal component 
was retained, and it accounted for 55% of the variance 
(see online supplementary appendix B). Cronbach’s 
alpha was 0.88, suggesting high internal consistency. 
Based on these results, we collapsed the eight items 
into a single summary score and used this measure as 
the outcome of interest for multiple linear regression. 
We used the adjusted R2 method for model selection 
targeted to Akaike information criteria.53 Our prespec-
ified candidate variables (based on available demo-
graphic data) included age, sex, ethnicity, education, 
whether the participant works in healthcare, or had 
close friends or family that work in healthcare, and 
the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) utility (a brief 
measure of quality of life).54
ethical considerations
All participants provided implied consent prior to 
answering the survey. In-person survey participants did 
not receive compensation. Internet survey respondents 
were compensated following the standard Qualtrics 
method ($1 per completed survey).
results
respondents
A total of 105/125 (84%) patients and family members 
completed the in-person surveys. In the internet panel, 
2100 returned usable surveys. Among these, 1050 
reported a prior ICU admission and were included in 
our analysis (figure 1). Respondent characteristics are 
displayed in table 1. Participants were predominantly 
middle-aged (median age 49), female (69%) and of 
white race (85%).
comfort voicing concerns
Among current ICU families, participants reported 
varying degrees of comfort voicing concerns in 
common ICU situations (table 2), with 69% of fami-
lies reporting they were very comfortable discussing 
medications and 31% reporting they were very 
comfortable discussing hand hygiene. About a third 
of current ICU family members were very comfort-
able discussing mismatched care goals, including disa-
greements where they or their loved one wanted care 
that was more (31%) or less aggressive (35%) than the 
team proposed. Approximately half of the current ICU 
family members felt very comfortable asking for clari-
fication of confusing or conflicting information (52%), 
or discussing a possible mistake in care (46%). Find-
ings overall showed similar trends between current 
families and participants reporting a prior ICU expe-
rience (table 2).
barriers to voicing concerns
In total, 16/103 (16%) current ICU families and 
181/1050 (17%) prior ICU participants reported they 
did not have concerns. Among all remaining respond-
ents, about half (504/956, 53%) provided at least one 
reason for hesitating to speak up. Invited to select up 
to three reasons, current ICU families selected a mean 
of 1.6 reasons (SD 0.81) and prior ICU participants 
selected a mean of 1.8 reasons (SD 0.83). Participants 
across both groups most commonly selected ‘I don’t 
want to be labeled as a ‘troublemaker’’ (34%); ‘the 
team is too busy’ (32%); ‘I don’t know how to raise 
my concern or who to talk to’ (32%); ‘I am afraid 
of seeming like I don’t understand medical concepts’ 
(23%); and ‘I don’t want to harm my relationship with 
members of the medical team’ (21%) (table 3). While 
the top 5 responses were the same across groups, 
compared with internet participants, family members 
of current ICU families more commonly reported the 
care team’s time constraints and fear of inadequate 
medical knowledge as a barrier. Internet participants 
more commonly reported they would hesitate because 
they did not know how to speak up, because ‘nothing 
would be done about my concerns’ or because ‘it isn’t 
my place to question the team’.

Original research
Patient/family factors associated with comfort voicing 
concerns
In multivariable regression of the speaking up score, 
older age, female sex and working in healthcare (all 
p<0.05) were positively associated with greater 
reported comfort voicing concerns, although with 
modest effects (online supplementary appendix C).
dIscussIon
Our study of patient and family comfort speaking up 
in the ICU—the first to our knowledge to address 
this issue—revealed that challenges to speaking 
up may be substantial during an ICU stay. Overall, 
50%–70% of current ICU admission patients and 
families expressed hesitancy to voice concerns in 
real time about some common care situations with 
safety implications, including a possible mistake or 
mismatched goals related to aggressiveness of care 
desired by patient/family versus delivered by the care 
team. We were surprised to find substantial deficits 
in patient/family comfort voicing concerns, even in 
‘life or death’ settings of the ICU, where the need 
to speak up may be particularly dire. Patients and 
family reported some barriers to comfort speaking 
up in the ICU that were similar to clinicians’ and 
some that were unique.24 43 47 55 Although the study 
focused on families at one north-east US hospital, 
overall responses were similar among respondents in 
a national internet panel of patients and families with 
prior ICU admissions across the USA. Given the high 
risks of errors, the exquisite preference sensitivity 
and the fraught dynamics of the ICU, we estimate 
that the ICU is one of the most important settings 
for optimising speaking up opportunities for patients 
and families.

Using a survey instrument developed with patients 
and families to reflect what matters most to them in 
terms of challenging ICU conversations and barriers to 
voicing concerns, our data provide key new evidence 
for healthcare organisations and clinicians to consider 
as they design and evaluate interventions to improve 
safety, quality and patient-centred care in the ICU, and 
have several practice implications. First, true partner-
ships with patients and families may be limited if they 
do not feel comfortable voicing concerns. Initiatives

Original research
to promote shared decision-making (particularly 
about care goals), family involvement in interdis-
ciplinary rounds, and other elements of patient and 
family engagement may have limited impact if they 
do not also actively and intentionally support voicing 
concerns in real time.
Second, our findings highlight specific clinical situa-
tions that merit focused attention. In addition to hand 
hygiene, patients and families were least comfort-
able speaking up about disagreements where they/
their loved one wanted more or less aggressive care 
than the team was proposing. Supporting patients 
and families to voice their priorities could poten-
tially decrease patient/family distress and, in some 
cases, even healthcare costs associated with inappro-
priately aggressive care.56 The reported reluctance to 
speak up about hand hygiene, a priority in preventing 
healthcare-associated infection, in both this and prior 
studies suggests the need for improved strategies to 
encourage assertiveness about this issue or alternative 
approaches to improve clinician hand hygiene.57 Our 
study participants’ hesitancy to ask about ‘confusing 
or conflicting information’ may have significant conse-
quences given its previously reported association with 
the quality of death and dying.18 Finally, our results 
highlight the need to explicitly support patients/fami-
lies to speak up in real time about perceived errors. 
Although experts call for partnership with patients and 
families to prevent medical errors,2 5 58 only about half 
of respondents indicated they would readily speak up 
about a potential mistake. Given current interest in 
transparency and patient engagement in safety, helping 
patients and families speak up in real time is likely an 
underexplored and undersupported component of 
effective safety partnerships.1 11 58
Third, patient-reported barriers to voicing concerns 
indicate targets for improvement. We were surprised 
that not knowing who to talk to about concerns—a 
readily actionable issue—was among the most common 
barriers reported by patients and families, alongside 
‘not wanting to be a troublemaker’. Clear and system-
atic instructions about whom to contact with concerns 
are a critical first step. Culturally reframing speaking 
up more positively—from ‘causing trouble’ to being 
an ‘engaged team member’ or ‘upstander’—may 
also help.13 Our findings suggest that patients and 
families may need greater support to offset concerns 
about potential negative relational repercussions from 
speaking up, similar to findings from studies focused 
on clinicians-in-training who may hesitate to speak 
up because of a low perceived status in the medical 
hierarchy, or fear of harming relationships with team 
members.43–47 Previously unrecognised barriers unique 
to patient and family speaking up include the percep-
tion that the team is too busy to hear their concerns, 
and that patients/families may worry about appearing 
to not understand medical concepts in front of their 
care team. Taken together, these findings resonate with 
other studies demonstrating that staff encouragement 
may play a key role in encouraging patient participa-
tion.55 59 Assurance that the healthcare team wants to 
hear about concerns may be particularly important 
for current ICU families, who reported ‘the team is 
too busy’ as the most common barrier to speaking up.

characteristics pertinent to patient/family speaking up,

*In the current family cohort, 2/105 individuals did not respond to this question and 16/103 participants did not have concerns. Among the remaining 
respondents, 29/87 who had concerns indicated one or more reasons why they would hesitate to speak up and 58/87 indicated that they would not 
hesitate to speak up.
†Among internet participants, 181/1050 did not have concerns. Among the remaining respondents, 475/869 individuals who had concerns indicated one 
or more reasons why they would hesitate to speak up and 394/869 indicated that they would not hesitate to speak up.
‡Presented as percentages, using the n indicated in the column header as the denominator, representing the number of respondents who selected at 
least one reason to hesitate. Percentages do not sum to 100 because participants could select up to three responses.
§‘Other’ responses included confusion or inability to remember questions, shy personality, perception that team is not interested or doesn’t care, fear of

Original research
such as health literacy and health status, may also help 
inform organisational strategies.24 57
Educational and logistical mechanisms to help patients 
and families voice concerns should emphasise that safety 
issues are vital, even if clinicians appear busy. Education 
programmes that instruct family members on how to 
assist with the care of critically ill patients can underscore 
the unique knowledge held by families, the importance 
of speaking up and the specific mechanisms for doing so, 
as participating in care can foster a sense of belonging to 
the team or may enable discovery of clinically important 
information.60 Family-centred communication training 
for clinicians should raise awareness about barriers to 
speaking up, emphasise encouragement of patients 
and families to speak up, and prepare clinicians to 
listen meaningfully.61 Families may also benefit from 
evidence that speaking up results in meaningful change, 
a common influencer of speaking up behaviour among 
healthcare and other professionals.62 63 Asking patients 
to take a risk without visible, positive responses to feed-
back may be counterproductive. Supporting patients and 
families in these ways can also send a powerful message 
to patients and clinicians about institutional priorities 
related to transparency, inclusivity and safety partner-
ship.1 37 64–68
Based on our findings of factors affecting voicing 
concerns, younger individuals, men and those without 
personal connection to healthcare may especially need 
support. Other studies suggest that less educated or 
unemployed patients and those with poorer health may 
be less likely to speak up.53 57 67 68 Our analysis did not 
show the same findings, perhaps because our study was 
specific to the ICU, because we queried family members 
as well as patients, or because those with higher formal 
education were more likely to second-guess themselves 
or fear negative consequences of voicing concerns. Our 
reported associations with speaking up should be viewed 
as exploratory and further examined among larger 
studies of ICU families, especially in light of the modest 
performance of the regression model.
Our findings are limited by self-report and subject to 
social desirability bias. Our primary cohort of current 
ICU family members was relatively small and surveyed 
at a single site, limiting generalisability; however, the 
internet cohort represents a large national sample, and 
overall trends were consistent across both cohorts. 
Although we based our list of candidate variables for our 
regression model on a literature review and discussion 
with patient and family advisors, it is possible that other 
factors not collected in our survey influence speaking 
up. For example, the influence of previous hospitalisa-
tions, ICU characteristics such as including families in 
daily rounds, speaking up climate among clinicians, and 
broader factors should be further studied. Our research 
did not interrogate a formal theoretical model, although 
models describing speaking up among clinicians were 
used as starting points to guide the enquiry along with 
input from PFAC members about what matters most to 
patients and families. We acknowledge that participant 
self-report may not directly correlate with observed 
behaviours, and future studies assessing actual patient 
and family speaking up at the front lines of care and 
the related clinical outcomes are needed. Finally, our 
study was not designed to differentiate between patient 
ICU experience and family ICU experience. Further 
research may delineate differences in comfort speaking 
up between these two groups.
conclusIons
Patients and families report considerable hesitancy to 
voice concerns in common ICU conversations. About half 
of all patients and families had some reluctance to speak 
up about possible mistakes, a finding which may limit 
both safety and engagement efforts. Patient-perceived 
barriers to speaking up in the ICU are mechanistic (how 
to do it), contextual (team is too busy) and cultural (fear 
of being a troublemaker). Educational strategies should 
include both encouraging and supporting patients and 
families to voice concerns with clear steps and a genuine 
invitation, and preparing clinicians to respond meaning-
fully when patients speak up.
