Abstract
Background: Current evidence that links 
“healthier” dietary patterns to better measured physical performance is mainly from older populations; 
little is known about the role of earlier diet. We examined adult diet quality in relation to physical performance at age 60–64 years.
Methods: Diet quality was defined using principal component analysis of dietary data collected at age 36, 43, 53, and 60–64. Throughout 
adulthood, diets of higher quality were characterized by higher consumption of fruit, vegetables, and wholegrain bread. Diet quality scores 
calculated at each age indicated compliance with this pattern. Physical performance was assessed using chair rise, timed-up-and-go, and 
standing balance tests at age 60–64. The analysis sample included 969 men and women.
Results: In gender-adjusted analyses, higher diet quality at each age was associated with better measured physical performance (all p < .01 for 
each test), although some associations were attenuated after adjustment for covariates. Diet quality scores were highly correlated in adulthood 
(0.44 ≤ r ≤ 0.67). However, conditional models showed that higher diet quality at age 60–64 (than expected from scores at younger ages), was 
associated with faster chair rise speed and with longer standing balance time (adjusted: 0.08 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.15] and 0.07 [0.01, 0.14] SD 
increase in chair rise speed and balance time, respectively, per SD increase in conditional diet quality; both p < .05).
Conclusions: Higher diet quality across adulthood is associated with better physical performance in older age. Current diet quality may be 
particularly important for physical performance, suggesting potential for improvements in diet in early older age.
Keywords: Diet, Life course, Ageing, Physical function.
Simple measures of muscle mass and function, such as handgrip 
strength and walking speed, act as biomarkers of ageing and are 
important predictors of future health and mortality (1). The vari-
ability in these measurements seen across the population (2) is 
therefore a concern. Although some of the observed inter-indi-
vidual differences are explained by known determinants, such 
as gender, age, and body build, much of the variability is unex-
plained (3). This has focused interest on modifiable behavioral 
factors, linked to lifestyle, and their influence on physical per-
formance in older age (4). The recent description of age-related 
changes in physiology and function in mid-life, occurring many 
years before losses in function are observed (5), highlights the 
need to understand the effects of these factors acting across the 
life course; recognizing that muscle mass and strength in later life 
reflect both the peak achieved in early adulthood and the rate of 
decline in later years (3,5–7).

 An important lifestyle influence is nutrition, and a number of can-
didate nutrients (protein, vitamin D, antioxidants, and n-3 fatty acids) 
have been linked to differences in muscle mass, strength, and physical 
performance in older age (8). But much of the evidence is observational, 
and collinearity between dietary constituents limits causal inferences. 
This has led to a growing interest in the role of diet quality in maintain-
ing good physical and cognitive function during ageing (9). “Healthier” 
patterns, which are linked to higher intakes of a range of protective nutri-
ents, as well as non-nutrients (such as polyphenols), have been shown to 
be associated with higher muscle mass, strength, and better measured 
physical performance (8). For example, lower rates of decline in physi-
cal performance have been described in individuals whose diets comply 
with a Mediterranean pattern (10–13). However, most of these studies 
have been carried out in older populations, and little is known about 
the contribution of differences in diet quality earlier in adult life, or in 
childhood. A recent analysis of data from an 18-year follow-up of the 
Nurses’ Health Study has, therefore, provided valuable new evidence; 
participants with healthier diets (averaged scores for Alternative Healthy 
Eating Index-2010, AHEI-2010), had a lower risk of self-reported inci-
dent physical impairment (Short Form-36 physical function scale, SF36) 
during the study period, suggesting that lifetime diet quality may have 
a protective role in preventing or delaying losses of physical function 
(14). But to understand the importance of diet quality, and to evaluate 
potential cumulative effects across the life course, longitudinal dietary 
data collected at different ages are needed. Using data from a British birth 
cohort study, in which prospective diet records were collected in child-
hood and adult life (15), we examined adult diet quality (ADQ) and its 
links to physical performance at age 60–64 years, using three standard-
ized tests of physical performance (chair rising, timed up-and-go [TUG], 
and standing balance).
Subjects and Methods
Study Sample
The MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) is 
a longitudinal study based on a socially stratified sample of 5362 
births occurring in one week in March 1946 across England, Wales, 
and Scotland (15). By the time of follow-up in 2006–2010, 718 par-
ticipants had died, 594 had withdrawn from the study, 567 had emi-
grated, and 320 were lost to the study. Of the remaining participants, 
2229 (78% of those invited) were assessed: 1690 (76%) at clinic and 
539 (24%) at home (15,16). The study was conducted according to 
the guidelines set out in the Declaration of Helsinki; ethical approval 
for the data collection was obtained from the Greater Manchester 
Local Research Ethics Committee and the Scotland A Research 
Ethics Committee.
Dietary Assessment
Diet was assessed using prospective 5-day food diaries completed 
by the participants at ages 36 (1982), 43 (1989), 53 (1999), and 
60–64 (2006–2010) (17,18). All food and drink items consumed 
were recorded using household measures; images and notes at the 
start of the diaries were provided to guide estimation of portion 
size. At age 60–64, 880 men and 989 women completed at least 3 
days of the food diary. Of these participants, 988 (53%) had com-
pleted food diaries (for at least 3 days) at every adult assessment. 
All foods and drinks consumed at each age were allocated to one 
of the 45 mutually exclusive food groups on the basis of similarity 
of type of food and nutrient composition [Supplementary Table 1]. 
The average consumption of each food group (g/day) was calculated 
for all participants at each age. A principal component analysis of 
the daily consumption of the 45 food groups at each age was used 
to examine dietary patterns (19). The first component described a 
“healthier” profile of foods at each age in adulthood (details are 
given in Supplementary methods; principal component analysis coef-
ficients are shown in Supplementary Table 2). Pattern scores, defin-
ing individual participant’s compliance with the “healthier” dietary 
pattern, are referred to as “diet quality scores” throughout the paper; 
a higher score indicated a diet of higher quality.
Physical Performance Outcomes
Physical performance was assessed by trained nurses following 
standard protocols using three tests at age 60–64: chair rises, TUG, 
and standing balance (21,22). The time taken to perform 10 chair 
rises (rise from a sitting to a standing position and sit back down 
again) was recorded and used to derive chair rise speed as the num-
ber of repetitions per minute. The TUG test required the participant 
to rise from a chair, walk 3 m at a normal pace, turn around, return 
to the chair, and sit down; TUG speed was calculated by dividing 6 
(distance in meters) by the time taken in seconds. Standing balance 
time was measured as the length of time a participant could stand 
on one leg with their eyes closed, up to a maximum of 30 seconds. 
The present analysis included 969 participants, for whom complete 
dietary data were available (at each age) and at least one measure of 
physical performance at age 60–64.
Participant Characteristics
Height and weight were measured by nurses at age 60–64. Self-
reported smoking status (never/ex/current) at age 60–64 was cat-
egorized into ever smokers and never smokers. Leisure time physical 
activity at age 60–64 was assessed by questionnaire; participants 
were asked how often in the previous month they had participated 
in any sports, vigorous leisure activities, or exercises and catego-
rized into the following groups: inactive (no participation); mod-
erately active (participated in relevant activities one to four times 
per month); and active (participated in relevant activities 5 or more 
times per month). Occupational social class was categorized using 
the Registrar General’s classification: I; II; III non-manual; III man-
ual; IV; and V. Self-reports of diabetes and doctor diagnosed angina 
and myocardial infarction from assessments undertaken up to and 
including age 60–64 were used to distinguish between participants 
with and without reports of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (7).
Statistical Analysis
Participant characteristics were described using summary statistics. 
Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess stability of diet 
quality. In addition to diet quality scores assessed at each age, an 
overall ADQ score was calculated for every participant. Using the 
quartiles of the diet quality score defined at age 60–64, points were 
allocated to the quarter of the distribution each participant’s diet 
quality score was in (1 = lowest quarter, 2 = second, 3 = third, and 
4 = highest quarter) at each age. These points were summed across 
the four ages in adulthood; scores ranged from 4 (poor diet quality 
across all ages) to 16 (high diet quality across all ages).
Diet quality scores at each age and physical performance meas-
ures were standardized (sex-specific) in models to ensure effect sizes 
were comparable. The variable for standing balance time was posi-
tively skewed and was therefore log-transformed after adding one. 
Height and weight were highly correlated; to avoid multi-collinear-
ity problems, a sex-specific standardized residual of weight-adjusted-
for-height was calculated as a measure of adiposity. Separate linear 
regression models were used to examine the association between

 diet quality scores at different ages and ADQ, in relation to each 
physical performance measure at 60–64 years. We considered a 
number of covariates, informed by previous analyses and published 
literature (14,22); models were adjusted for gender, age at follow-
up, height, weight-for-height residual, smoking history, leisure time 
physical activity, presence of diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. As 
diet quality has been shown to differ between men and women (23), 
we examined potential gender–diet interactions; in gender-adjusted 
models, the statistical significance (p < .05) of interaction effects 
between gender and diet quality scores was assessed. We evaluated 
the impact of adjustment for social class in separate models, and we 
examined whether associations in the analysis sample were general-
izable to the wider NSHD cohort. In sensitivity analyses, diet qual-
ity scores were derived using the maximum available sample with 
dietary data at each age and relationships between diet quality at 
each age and the physical performance measures were re-examined.
Conditional models were used to examine whether higher diet 
quality than expected at age 60–64, given diet quality at earlier ages, 
was associated with differences in the physical performance meas-
ures at age 60–64. To implement these, residuals, representing con-
ditional diet quality scores, were obtained by regressing diet quality 
scores at each age in adulthood on the adult diet quality scores at all 
previous assessments (24). Each physical performance measure was 
then regressed on all conditional diet quality scores with adjustment 
for diet quality at age 36 and other participant characteristics.
Results
Participant Characteristics
The characteristics of 969 participants who were included in the 
analysis sample are presented in Table 1. Mean age at clinic visit 
was 63 years among men and women. Although mean TUG speed 
was similar among men and women, men recorded slightly longer 
standing balance times and had faster chair rise speed than women 
on average.
Compared with the participants who were assessed at the most 
recent follow-up of the cohort but were not included in the analy-
sis sample due to incomplete dietary or physical performance data, 
men and women in the analysis sample had lower mean body mass 
index and longer standing balance times (p < .05 for all); chair rise 
and TUG speeds did not differ significantly between the two samples 
(p > .05). Women in the analysis sample were more likely to have 
never smoked, to have engaged in physical activity at least once per 
month, and to be of higher social class (p < .05); there were no dif-
ferences in these characteristics among men.
Diet Quality
Mean diet quality score increased from age 36 to 60–64 among 
men and women (Figure 1). Women had higher diet quality scores 
than men at all ages in adulthood (p < .001). However, although 
mean diet quality scores increased across adulthood, the correlations 
between scores at all ages in adulthood were reasonably high (0.44 ≤ 
r ≤ 0.67), indicating stability in ranking of participants in terms 
of their diet quality between 36 and 60–64 years (Supplementary 
Table 3). At all ages, increasing diet quality scores were associated 
with greater consumption of fresh fruit, leafy vegetables, and who-
legrain bread, but lower consumption of white bread, added sugar, 
and processed meat (all p-values for trends < .001; Supplementary 
Table 4). The differences were large such that three- to fourfold dif-
ferences in consumption were observed for many of these foods 
across the range of diet quality scores.
Relationship Between Diet Quality in Adulthood and 
Physical Performance Measures
The associations between diet quality in adulthood and physical per-
formance at age 60–64 are presented in Table 2. There was little evi-
dence of gender-diet interactions (data not shown); men and women 
were, therefore, pooled for all analyses. In the gender-adjusted analy-
sis, higher diet quality scores at each age were associated with better 
measured performance in the three tests (p < .01). These associa-
tions were mostly robust to adjustment (gender, age at follow-up, 
height, weight-for-height residual, smoking history, physical activity, 
diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) (p < .05), with the exception of 
the associations regarding diet quality at age 43, and the association 
between diet quality at age 53 and TUG speed. There were consistent 
positive associations between diet quality and physical performance 
in the cross-sectional associations at 60–64 years, and using the 
overall ADQ score. The size of effects was meaningful; for example, 
compared with individuals in the bottom quartile of diet quality at 
60–64 years, those in the top quartile performed 2.37 (95% CI: 0.96, 
3.79) additional chair rises per minute in gender-adjusted analysis 
and 1.75 (0.28, 3.23) additional chair rises in fully adjusted analy-
ses (data not shown). Further adjustment for social class attenuated 
the associations between diet quality at younger ages and physical 
performance at age 60–64 so that the associations with diet quality 
at age 53 and between ADQ score and chair rise and TUG speed 
were no longer statistically significant (data not shown). However, 
the cross-sectional associations between diet quality at age 60–64 
and both chair rise speed and standing balance time were robust 
to adjustment (both, p = .004); TUG was of borderline significance 
(p = .052). Sensitivity analyses, which included all participants who 
provided dietary data at each age, showed comparable associations

 between diet quality scores at each age and the physical performance 
outcomes to the analysis sample (Supplementary Table 5).
Because there was tracking of diet quality across adulthood, we 
used conditional models to explore whether higher diet quality than 
predicted, based on earlier diet quality scores, was associated with 
better physical performance. Using these models, higher diet quality 
than expected at age 60–64, when taking into account earlier diet 
quality, was associated with faster chair rise speed and with longer 
standing balance time (Table 3). These relationships were robust in 
the fully adjusted analysis and when additionally adjusted for social 
class (data not shown).
Discussion
We have used prospective diet records, collected at four points 
between the ages of 36 and 60–64, to examine associations between 
diet quality across adulthood and measured physical performance 
in older age. Diets of higher quality, characterized by higher con-
sumption of fruit and vegetables and wholegrain bread, and lower 
consumption of white bread, potato products, added sugar, and pro-
cessed meat, were positively associated with all measures of physi-
cal performance at 60–64 years. This was a consistent finding for 
diet quality defined at different ages and using an index of overall 
diet quality in adulthood and was largely robust to adjustment for 
other participant characteristics, which included physical activity 
and smoking status. Comparable associations to the analysis sample 
were observed when dietary data were analyzed for all available par-
ticipants, and findings were similar in men and women. However, the 
strongest associations were observed in the cross-sectional analyses 
of diet quality at 60–64 years, in relation to contemporary meas-
ures of physical performance. Furthermore, our conditional analyses

 showed higher diet quality than expected at age 60–64 (when taking 
into account earlier diet quality) was associated with faster chair 
rise speed and with longer standing balance time. This may suggest 
that changes in food choice, to improve overall diet quality in later 
life, could have potential to improve physical performance—and to 
contribute to healthier ageing.
There is some interest in the effects of long-term exposure to 
dietary patterns across the life course, as influences on health in later 
life. For example, in a large population of adults studied in the China 
Health and Nutrition Survey, “healthier” dietary trajectories in mid-
life were associated with lower HbA1C at 15-year follow-up, even if 
contemporary dietary pattern scores were similar (25). This suggests 
that the cumulative effects of exposure linked to diabetes risk in later 
life may be more important than current diet. Similarly, using data 
from the NSHD to examine long-term effects of dietary patterns on 
bone health in older age, Ward and colleagues found that the trajec-
tory of a protein-calcium–potassium rich dietary pattern between 36 
and 60–64 years was associated with higher bone mineral content 
across all skeletal sites in women (26).
Our finding that higher adult diet quality is related to better 
measured physical performance in older age is consistent with other 
evidence, although there are few data from other longitudinal stud-
ies, with repeat assessments of dietary intake throughout adulthood, 
to compare directly with our study. The most comparable prospective 
cohort is the Whitehall cohort in the UK, in which fruit and vegetable 
consumption, an indicator of diet quality, was reported 17, 10, and 
5 years before an assessment of physical performance (at mean age 
65.9 ± 5.9 years) (27). The findings were similar; low fruit and veg-
etable consumption (less than two portions per day) recorded at each 
wave, and a longer period of low fruit and vegetable consumption in 
adult life, was associated with slower walking speed at follow-up. In the 
Whitehall study, there was evidence of an accumulation of risk for slow 
walking speed that was associated with low fruit and vegetable con-
sumption. Although we found graded differences in measured physical 
performance in relation to overall ADQ, which may be consistent with 
cumulative effects (Table 2), the tracking of diet quality throughout 
adulthood made this difficult to assess in our study. Furthermore, the 
observed improvements in measured physical performance, in relation 
to improvements in diet quality closer to the time of measurement, seen 
in the conditional analyses, may point more to the importance of cur-
rent diet. However, further data are needed to confirm this.
The compilation of dietary data over long time periods is affected 
by background changes in food habits and food availability. Using 
the longitudinal dietary data collected in this survey, we were able 
to describe improvements in diet quality between 1982 and the most 
recent data collection in 2006–2010; although women had higher 
diet quality scores at each age in adulthood, the changes over time 
were evident in both genders. These changes are explained by trends 
in food consumption that have been described previously (17); con-
sumption of less healthy foods (including white bread, added sugar, 
and processed meat) fell, whereas healthy foods (including vegeta-
bles, wholemeal bread, reduced-fat milk) increased. This may reflect 
participants’ increasing adherence to healthy eating guidance (pro-
moted consistently in the UK since the 1980s), together with changes 
to the food supply (such as the availability of reduced fat milk) (28). 
To ensure comparability of patterns over time, we used fixed coef-
ficients from the principal component analysis of the dietary data 
collected at 60–64 years (20); using this approach, we were able 
to show stability in ranking of participants in terms of diet quality 
through adulthood, alongside the background changes in diet that 
were taking place.
A strength of this study is the availability of prospective dietary 
data, assessed and analyzed using consistent methods across adult-
hood. It is also important that we examined objective measures of 
physical performance. But it is a limitation of the study that a sub-
sample of the original cohort, who provided dietary data at each 
stage of the survey, was included in this analysis, and that they dif-
fered in some characteristics from the remainder of the cohort. For 
example, when compared with other participants who were studied 
at 60–64 years who did not have complete dietary data, average body 
mass index was lower among the participants in the analysis sample. 
Although this may have implications for the external validity of the 
findings presented, we make internal comparisons in our analyses, 
and it is unlikely that these differences would explain the data we 
present. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses, using diet quality scores, 
derived using the maximum available sample with dietary data at 
each age, showed similar associations to the analysis sample. A sec-
ond limitation is that we used self-reported dietary data, for which 
there are concerns regarding measurement error (29). However, this 
may be less important for the description of overall dietary pat-
terns; importantly, comparable patterns have been reported using 
different dietary assessment methods (30,31). Thirdly, although we 
observed links between lower diet quality at younger ages in adult-
hood and poorer measured physical performance when the NSHD 
participants were aged 60–64, we cannot exclude the possibility that 
reverse causation could explain or contribute to these associations. 
Finally, although in observational data there is potential for residual 
confounding, and additionally, we cannot account for measurement 
error in the covariates considered, there are sound mechanistic rea-
sons to link higher diet quality to better physical performance in 
older age; this pattern would be expected to provide higher intakes 
of a range of nutrients (protein, vitamin D, and antioxidants) (23), 
which, in turn, are linked to positive effects on muscle mass and 
strength and physical performance in older age (8).
Our findings link quality of diet to better physical performance 
in older age, suggesting that improvement in diet quality has the 
potential to yield gains in function. If these observational findings 
are confirmed in other studies, they have important public health 
implications: positive changes in dietary patterns in early older age 
could have benefits for physical performance and healthier ageing.
