THE IMPACT OF A PAN-REGIONAL INCLUSIVE TRAUMA SYSTEM ON QUALITY OF CARE 
INTRODUCTION 
As with many areas of modern medicine, the delivery of high quality trauma care is dependent on timely 
access to specialist expertise and resources.  Quality includes the well-timed delivery of expert, appropriately 
resourced care. Trauma systems are public health models of care that aim to assure access to, and the quality 
of injury care for their designated population1 2, which are governed by quality assurance and performance 
improvement frameworks 3, 4.  While regional systems appear to reduce overall mortality through enhanced 
resources5-7 and improved access1, 8  the specific aspects by which they deliver improved quality are unclear.  
In particular, the differences between organisational change and clinical delivery of care on overall quality are 
under reported. This has important implications for the future implementation and evolution of trauma 
systems. 
The 2007 National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) reviewed the quality of 
care of all severely injured patients in England and Wales 9.  Cases were identified over a three-month period 
and were evaluated by a team of expert advisors.  At this time there were no formal regional trauma systems 
in place in the UK and the report demonstrated inadequacies in the quality of care for 60% of severely injured 
patients 9.  Three years later in April 2010, the Greater London urban area implemented a contiguous trauma 
system for a population of 10 million people.   The system was designed to be inclusive, with cooperating 
networks of major trauma centres, trauma units and prehospital care providers.  The NCEPOD study described 
the base-state prior to implementation, therefore this represented a unique opportunity to understand the 
quality, strengths and weaknesses of organised systems of trauma care.  Quality assessment of large scale 
regionalisation in trauma care has yet to be described although has clear global relevance for healthcare 
system development.  
We wished to evaluate the impact of the implementation of an inclusive pan-regional trauma system on 
quality of care following severe injury. The primary objective of this study was to assess the quality of trauma 
care and outcomes following regionalisation.  Second, we wished to examine the effect of trauma networks on 
access for injured patients and the utilization of secondary transfers across the network.  Finally we wished to 
evaluate the degree to which the systems goal of inclusiveness had been achieved across the whole network.  
 3 
 
We conducted a prospective cohort study across the London Trauma System (LTS) and compared the results to 
those in the original NCEPOD study. 
 
METHODS 
Study setting 
The LTS is geographically divided into four networks and serves the population Greater London (8.3 million 
people) and a portion of the wider metropolitan area (10 � 12 million people approximately).  All of the 
networks are based on the hub and spoke principle of inclusive regionalised care.  Services, processes and 
resources are subject to designation criteria10. Four Major Trauma Centres (MTCs) are responsible for treating 
the most severely injured patients. MTCs (equivalent to level one centers), are specialty hospitals with a full 
complement of clinical disciplines available on site. Each MTC is associated with a number of designated 
trauma units (TUs, approximately equivalent to level three centers). TUs are capable of treating less severely 
injured patients and able to initiate treatment and onward transfer of those identified as requiring MTC level 
care.   Pre-hospital distribution of patients is coordinated via a pan-London triage tool. Pre-hospital care is 
provided by the London Ambulance Service in cooperation with regional boundary ambulance services 
augmented by physician-led emergency medical teams (land and helicopter). Pre-hospital physicians are 
tasked to trauma requiring a greater level of care at scene, such as rapid sequence induction of anesthesia.  
 
Data collection 
Evaluation of the London Trauma System (ELoTS) utilised the core methodology described in the NCEPOD 
report 9.  For the three month period from February to April 2013, all trauma patients (adult and paediatric) 
were identified prospectively within all MTCs and TUs across each network. Patient case notes from 
prehospital care through to hour 72 of hospital admission (or death) were copied, anonymised and securely 
stored at each network MTC. Internal review board approval for service evaluation was agreed and data were 
collected as part of institutional clinical audit. The primary inclusion criteria was severe injury, defined by an 
injury severity score (ISS) of greater than 15 utilising Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS 98) coding 11. This was 
calculated locally and verified with the Trauma Audit Research Network (TARN: www.tarn.ac.uk).  Patients 
 4 
 
were excluded if they were found to have an ISS<16; a non-trauma patient or if there was a delay in 
presentation of >72 hours from injury (primarily due to repatriation from other facilities in the UK or overseas).  
In order to assess improvement to timely resuscitation and early diagnosis, data were collected on 
demographics, mechanism of injury, prehospital care, trauma team response, time to consultant review, time 
to diagnostic imaging and operative intervention and any inter-hospital transfer arrangements in the first 72 
hours. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was the most common severe injury reported by NCEPOD; therefore we 
specifically examined time to neurosurgery consultation and emergency neurosurgery.  The effects of system 
care on outcome, namely early mortality was evaluated (defined as per the NCEPOD study criteria as a death 
��� ����� ���� ��������� �� ����������  A��������� ����� ���� ��� �������� NECPOD ������ ���������� 
quantitative and qualitative measures of care were completed for each patient enrolled in the study.   
 
Assessment of Quality of Care 
Previous NCEPOD study expert reviewers and representatives from TARN were invited to participate as quality 
assessors. A multidisciplinary group of eight independent external experts (from outside the LTS) and twenty 
one peer reviewers was convened. The panel for each network evaluation was comprised of expert and peer 
reviewers external to that network to mitigate any reporting bias. Anonymised case notes and assessment 
forms were evaluated using quality performance indicators derived from the NECPOD study. To enhance inter-
assessor reliability, standardised NCEPOD assessment criteria were used for each anonymised case. Panels at 
each network assessment were encouraged to discuss cases to increase concordance and agree quality grade 
consensus. 
To assess the overall care for each patient a grading system was developed based on the original NCEPOD 
criteria:  
1. Good care - A standard that you would accept from yourself, your trainees and your institution. 
2. Clinical deficits - aspects of clinical care could have been improved. 
3. Organisational deficits - aspects of organisational care could have been improved. 
4. Deficits in both - aspects of both clinical and organisational care could have been improved. 
 5 
 
5. Less than satisfactory - several aspects of clinical and/or organisational care were less than 
satisfactory, well below that you would accept from yourself, your trainees and your institution. 
 
Data analysis 
ELoTS data were compared with that from the NCEPOD study. Time-based raw data were unavailable from 
NCEPOD thereby preventing any direct comparative statistical analysis.  Where available, summary data from 
��� NCEPOD �T����� W�� C����� ������ 9 were used for comparison with ELoTS. Categorical variables were 
�������� ����� F������� ����� �� C�� S����� ����� and reported as percentage and relative risk (RR) with 95% 
confidence intervals. Consistent with NCEPOD data, age is expressed as mean, and other numerical non-
parametric data are expressed as median with interquartile range. Internal consistency of the quality rating 
across the MTCs ��� �������� ����� C��������� A����� 
In addition to overall system performance we compared quality and performance at major trauma centres 
(MTC-ELoTS) with similar high volume hospitals in NCEPOD (HV-NCEPOD). High volume centres were 
previously defined by NCEPOD as those large multi-specialty hospitals with on-site neurosurgical facilities who 
reported greater than 20 cases during the study period. All four hospitals which subsequently became MTCs 
participated in the original NCEPOD research.  For this analysis NCEPOD provided summary data on overall 
quality assessment, injury severity, mortality, time to assessment and intervention. Statistical analysis was 
performed using SPSSv.21, IBM Corp.  A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  
 
RESULTS 
During the three month study period, 344 severely injured patients were identified as suitable for inclusion. 
Following application of exclusion criteria and removal of cases with missing medical notes there were 321 
cases with ISS>15 available for quality assessment. 269 (84%) patients were admitted directly to an MTC and 
52 (16%) patients were triaged initially to Trauma Units and then secondarily transferred to an MTC. 
Demographics of enrolled patients are detailed in Table 1.  In comparison with NCEPOD, ELoTS patients were 
 6 
 
older and had increased use of pre-hospital physician trauma teams i.e. Helicopter Emergency Medical 
Services (HEMS) (Table 1).  
Quality Assessment 
Overall, patients in the London Trauma System received a significantly higher quality of care than described in 
NCEPOD.  There was a significant �������� �� ��� ������ �� �������� ����������� �� ��������� �G��� ������� 
����� �NCEPOD� ��� ��� ALL-ELoTS: 69%, RR 1.3 [1.2 to 1.4], p<0.001). Improvements were evident in all 
categories of assessment (Figure 1A), with greatest benefit observed in the reduction of organisational deficits 
(NCEPOD: 23% vs. All-ELoTS: 10%, RR 0.43 [0.30 to 0.61], p=0.02).  Good care was higher in MTCs compared to 
HV-NCEPOD hospitals (HV-NCEPOD: 58% vs. MTC-ELoTS: 74%, RR 1.2 [1.0 to 1.4], p=0.02), with increases in the 
quality of patient management seen across all categories (Figure 1B).  There was good internal consistency 
between quality ratings across the �������� �C��������� A���� 0.76). 
Processes of care 
Considerable improvements were observed in the initial assessment of injured patients on arrival at the ED, 
with a significant increase in trauma team response (NCEPOD: 60% vs. All-ELoTS: 92%, RR 1.5 [1.4 to 1.6, 
p<0.001, Figure 2A). This was further enhanced for severely injured patients taken directly to an MTC, with a 
near universal trauma team response (HV-NCEPOD: 73% vs. MTC-ELoTS: 99%, RR 1.3 [1.2 to 1.5], p<0.001, 
Figure 2A). Early involvement of senior clinicians was greatly improved with a three-fold increase in consultant-
led trauma teams (NCEPOD: 27% vs. All-ELoTS: 88%, RR 3.2 [2.8 to 3.6], p<0.001).  The majority of patients 
were seen by a consultant in the ED within 30 minutes of arrival (NCEPOD: 38% vs. All-ELoTS: 92%, RR 2.4 [2.2 
to 2.6], p<0.001, Figure 2B) with even more marked improvements evident at MTCs (HV-NCEPOD: 57% vs. 
MTC-ELoTS: 97%, RR 1.3 [1.1 to 1.6], p<0.001, Figure 2B).

arrival. When used in early hemorrhage assessment, average time to whole body CT from ED arrival was 
reduced by two thirds (NCEPOD: 138 mins vs. All-ELoTS: 52 mins, Figure 2C).  Pre and post implementation of 
the LTS, 14% of patients required emergency hemorrhage control (operative or interventional radiology) but 
following trauma system implementation substantial reductions in time to laparotomy from ED arrival were 
 7 
 
observed (NCEPOD: 384 minutes vs. median All-ELoTS: 47 minutes (IQR 29-88) [no comparative raw NCEPOD 
data available], Figure 2D). 
TBI was suspected in the majority of ELoTS patients (82%), mandating urgent neurological assessment. There 
were non-significant increases in utility of CT head scanning (NCEPOD 68% vs. All-ELoTS: 77%, p=0.20) with a 
median time to CT head scan of 33 minutes (IQR 21 to 56) for All-ELoTS patients (no comparative time-data 
availability for NCEPOD). Within the LTS, patients presenting initially to a TU had significantly longer waits for 
CT Head compared to those taken directly to an MTC (TU: 118 minutes vs. MTC: 38 minutes, p<0.001, Figure 
3A). Additional benefits were seen at MTCs, with a three-fold increase in CT head within one hour of arrival 
(HV-NCEPOD: 28% vs. MTC-ELoTS: 82%, RR 2.9 [2.2 to 3.8], p<0.001, Figure 3B).  Compared to NCEPOD, 
significantly more patients were referred for urgent neurosurgical opinion (NCEPOD: 32% vs. All-ELoTS: 55%, 
RR 1.7 [1.4 to 1.9], p<0.01). Time to neurosurgical review improved with a four-fold increase in specialist 
consultation within one hour of referral (NCEPOD: 10% vs. All-ELoTS: 45%, RR 4.4 [3.5 to 4.6], p<0.001, Figure 
3C), with significant differences observed for those patients admitted directly to an MTC (HV-NCEPOD: 23% vs. 
MTC-ELoTS: 48%, RR 2.2 [1.6 to 3.1], p<0.01).  All MTC patients requiring urgent neurosurgery were operated 
on within four hours from arrival in comparison to 67% of those patients treated at NCEPOD hospitals with 
neurosurgery on-site,  (RR 1.5 [1.3 to 1.6], p<0.001, Figure 3D).  
Mortality 
To substantiate the overall quality improvements, the effect on early mortality (within the first 72 hours) was 
evaluated. Of the 22 deaths observed, 19 occurred within the first 24 hours post admission, two patients died 
between 24 and 48 hours and one death occurred just prior to 72 hours. The primary causes of death were TBI 
(16), haemorrhage (4) and severe crush injury (2).    Overall early unadjusted mortality rates in the LTS were 
reduced in comparison to NCEPOD (Figure 4).  We observed improved early survival for all degrees of injury, 
with greatest benefits seen in the most critically injured patients (ISS>35) where crude mortality rates 
decreased by more than half for ELoTS patients (NCEPOD: 31% vs. All-ELoTS 11%, RR 0.37 [0.33 to 0.99], 
p=0.04). Similar trends in mortality benefits were seen for patients treated directly at MTCs, where early 
deaths decreased by nearly half (HV-NCEPOD: 13% vs. MTC-ELoTS 7%, RR 0.53 [0.28 to 0.99], p=0.06).

Access to Care & Inclusivity  
Following system implementation, access to early specialist trauma care increased, with 84% of severely 
injured patients taken directly to a MTC in contrast to 16% in the NCEPOD study.  There was a trend toward 
fewer patients (n=52) requiring a secondary transfer from a TU compared to NCEPOD (NCEPOD: 24% vs. All-
ELoTS: 16%, RR 0.67 [0.51 to 0.89], p=0.21). Multisystem injury (78%) or patients with TBI requiring 
neurosurgical consultation (18%) accounted for the majority of secondary transfers.  Significant improvements 
were observed in the receiving institutions with 90% of cases accepted by a consultant grade doctor, 
compared to 18% in NCEPOD (p<0.001).  
Inclusive trauma systems are responsible for the management of all patients, regardless of whether they are 
taken to an MTC or TU initially. In ELoTS, data derived from TARN demonstrated that 98 patients with ISS>15 
remained at TUs.  Data capture from this cohort of patients was poor with few case records made available to 
the study team.  We were therefore unable to fully assess the impact of regionalisation for patients who 
remained at a TU without transfer to the regional MTC. From the data available, the median age of patients 
who remained at a TU post-injury was 82 (IQR: 60-91) and the predominant injury for this cohort was TBI. For 
patients who were transferred, similar quality improvements seen at MTCs were not observed to the same 
extent in those patients who were treated at a TU initially (Table 2).   
Further analysis of trauma care quality assessment revealed broad differences in the categories of observed 
deficit between patients seen initially at TUs and those presenting directly to MTCs (Table 3). Poor or 
incomplete documentation was noted for one in ten cases at MTCs and 8% of patients had room for 
improvement in one aspect of clinical management. In the available TU case notes, one third of patients were 
reported to have had deficits in care resulting from either a lack of senior decision making or clinical care 
(Table 3).   
 
DISCUSSION 
The effects of public health systems on the quality and delivery of care are difficult to evaluate as baseline 
assessments are rarely available.  We have shown that institution of a regional trauma is associated with 
 9 
 
significant improvements in the overall quality of care for patients treated at MTCs, and that this is almost 
exclusively due to organisational change. Improvements in the timely delivery of specialist multidisciplinary 
care were associated with increased survival.  However, decreased time-to process measures such as 
haemorrhage control may be related to improvements in access rather than specific clinical decision making. 
The system model did not appear to directly reduce deficits in the clinical aspects of care, and there was a 
suggestion of increased inequality of access across the region with improvements in quality and data 
availability in MTCs not observed in TUs.  Nevertheless, the implementation of a large inclusive regional 
trauma system has resulted in demonstrable care quality and outcome benefits for the majority of severely 
injured trauma patients. 
Previous retrospective pre- and post-analyses of an inclusive trauma system reported significantly reduced in-
hospital mortality, specifically for those with minor injuries and for patients over the age of 70 years 12.  Three 
years after implementation, system improvements were associated with improved early mortality for severely 
and critically injured patients, however further benefits of the network are as yet unknown.  It is important to 
go beyond mortality and look at other sensitive measures of outcome and system successes. In order to do 
this, expert and peer assessment may be more valuable than measuring processes of care and key 
performance indicators, as it allows a closer, broader evaluation of patient pathways and care. There were 
������������ ���� ��� L����� T����� S����� ����� ���� �� �������� �������� ������� ������� ���� ������ 
automatically seen at the three year time point after implementation.  
LTS was designed as an inclusive system, which theoretically should reduce inequalities caused by access issues 
and variations in standards of care. Trauma system quality guidance primarily focuses on resources at MTCs 13, 
yet clearly TUs have an important role to play.  Access to data at TUs was very limited but where available, did 
suggest the beneficial effects on care quality seen at MTCs were not observed for patients seen initially in TUs.  
This observation requires further detailed study to evaluate the effect of volume on care post system 
implementation 14 and potential for unfamiliarity with clinical protocols, reduced engagement or an 
unintended exclusive approach to trauma care within the network. In an exclusive trauma system only those 
acute care hospitals with the most resources are designated as trauma centres15, 16. Evaluation of exclusive 
systems suggests that whilst they are cheaper, quality and outcomes are reported to be worse than inclusive 
systems 15, 17-19. Data available from TUs when compared to lower volume (LV)-NCEPOD suggest that within LTS 
 10 
 
there exists a degree of system exclusivity with the potential to impact on quality of care.  Further work is 
required across the system as a whole to explore this effect and how it may be mitigated. 
There are several limitations to this study which principally relate to availability of data. First, we acknowledge 
that we were unable to compare the LTS with data from London-only hospitals within the NCEPOD study. The 
primary objective was not to directly compare specific hospitals but rather evaluate the quality of an organised 
system of trauma care against the pre-existing standard demonstrated in the 2007 report, however we 
recognise the potential differences in populations.  Implementation of regional trauma systems across England 
and Wales since 2010 has largely been based on the London model and therefore we hope that findings from 
the LTS will have direct relevance for other network evaluation. Second, we could not access all of the records 
for patients who remained at TUs during the study period. A complete evaluation of quality was therefore only 
possible for TU patients transferred to an MTC or admitted directly to an MTC and the impact for those 
remaining at TUs is uncertain. According to TARN, 49% of injured patients in the UK were managed entirely 
outside of MTCs in 2013, and this figure may be under-reported given data incompleteness nationally 
(personal communication F Lecky, TARN). The missing ELoTS TU data does impact on the interpretation of the 
study findings and requires further evaluation a national level. Third, there was the potential for inter-assessor 
variability although we aimed to reduce this risk through utilisation of the same core NCEPOD assessment 
criteria during the quality review with emphasis on discussion between grading assessors to improve 
concordance. Finally, cause and effect cannot be attributed from this observational study. Quality and 
outcome benefits associated with regionalisation may have arisen from other changes in clinical practice e.g. 
use of tranexamic acid or introduction of hemorrhage protocols, although therapeutic advances in trauma care 
are more likely to be available initially within MTCs.   
In summary, we have assessed the effect of a regional inclusive system on the quality of trauma care and 
demonstrated clear improvements which translate to tangible patient outcomes.  Inclusive trauma systems 
appear to deliver quality through organisational change, but may not automatically lead to a reduction in 
preventable errors or improvements in clinical care.  Robust system wide performance improvement 
programmes with quality assurance, multidisciplinary education and on-going trauma training for MTCs and 
TUs are required to avoid clinical variance and provide optimal care for all injured patients.  Three years after 
 11 
 
implementation of the LTS, we have shown substantial improvements in the quality and processes of trauma 
care which are associated in reduced mortality following severe injury in patients treated at MTCs.
