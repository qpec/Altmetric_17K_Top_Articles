Cannabis use is observationally associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia, but whether the relationship is causal is not
known. Using a genetic approach, we took 10 independent genetic variants previously identified to associate with cannabis use in
32 330 individuals to determine the nature of the association between cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia. Genetic variants
were employed as instruments to recapitulate a randomized controlled trial involving two groups (cannabis users vs nonusers) to
estimate the causal effect of cannabis use on risk of schizophrenia in 34 241 cases and 45 604 controls from predominantly
European descent. Genetically-derived estimates were compared with a meta-analysis of observational studies reporting ever use
of cannabis and risk of schizophrenia or related disorders. Based on the genetic approach, use of cannabis was associated with
increased risk of schizophrenia (odds ratio (OR) of schizophrenia for users vs nonusers of cannabis: 1.37; 95% confidence interval
(CI), 1.09–1.67; P-value = 0.007). The corresponding estimate from observational analysis was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.19–1.67; P-value for
heterogeneity = 0.76). The genetic markers did not show evidence of pleiotropic effects and accounting for tobacco exposure did
not alter the association (OR of schizophrenia for users vs nonusers of cannabis, adjusted for ever vs never smoker: 1.41; 95% CI,
1.09–1.83). This adds to the substantial evidence base that has previously identified cannabis use to associate with increased risk of
schizophrenia, by suggesting that the relationship is causal. Such robust evidence may inform public health messages about
cannabis use, especially regarding its potential mental health consequences.

INTRODUCTION
Cannabis is the most widely misused illicit drug with an estimated
182 million consumers in 2013 globally.1 Several high-profile
observational studies have reported a positive, dose-dependent
association between cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia,
especially in young people in whom cannabis use is particularly
high.2 The lifetime risk of schizophrenia is ∼ 0.7%, and the natural
history of disease carries a high risk of long-term symptoms and
disability together with a reduced life expectancy.3 In addition,
schizophrenia represents a high economic burden with an estimated
cost of $63 billion per year in the United States.4 Clarifying the causal
role between cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia is therefore
important to understanding the health impacts of cannabis
exposure and to inform on potential preventative strategies to
alleviate the burden of disease from schizophrenia.5
A substantial body of observational evidence supports the
hypothesis that cannabinoids play a role in the development of
schizophrenia.2 Prospective observational studies, with decades of
follow-up and accounting for a large number of potential
confounding
factors
(such
as
demographic,
family
history,
personal history, socioeconomic or other environmental markers)
have consistently demonstrated that exposure to cannabis is
associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia or related
disorders.2 These findings have been reinforced by basic research
experiments that point to cannabis altering various neurotrans-
mission pathways linked to pathogenesis of psychotic disorders
and by interfering with neurodevelopment in adolescents.6 Despite
this, any causal link between cannabis use and psychotic disorders
remains controversial as observational findings can always be
hampered by confounding (where another risk factor associated
with cannabis actually causes the disease) and/or reverse causality
bias (where individuals affected by schizophrenia may be more
prone to consume cannabis).2,7 Moreover, cannabis use is strongly
associated with tobacco consumption and the latter has been
observationally related to risk of schizophrenia meaning smoking
could confound the link between cannabis and schizophrenia.8
In the setting where a randomized trial—representing the
optimal method to test a clinical hypothesis—of a harmful
exposure (such as cannabis consumption) would be unethical, a
genetic approach represents a valid alternative to assess causality
free from confounding or reverse causality bias.9 Using Mendelian
randomization (MR) principles, causality between an exposure

 (such as cannabis use) and an outcome (for example, schizo-
phrenia) can be tested through use of genetic markers that
associate with the exposure, employed as instruments providing
certain assumptions are met.10 Recent developments of MR
facilitate assessing the robustness of the causal effect estimate by
testing for presence of pleiotropy (where genetic markers asso-
ciate with the outcome through more than one causal pathway,
also known as horizontal pleiotropy). Egger Mendelian randomiza-
tion (MR-Egger) and weighted median MR provide statistical tests
for presence of pleiotropic effects of the single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) under analysis (and provide a causal
estimate that takes this into account).11,12 On the other hand,
multivariable MR provides a causal estimate for an exposure that
statistically adjusts for potential pleiotropic effects of the genetic
marker(s) with a risk factor (for example, tobacco consumption).13
We used SNPs associated with ever use of cannabis reported in
a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS)14 as instruments
to clarify the causal role of cannabis consumption on risk of
schizophrenia. We then assessed for presence of pleiotropy of the
genetic markers through MR-Egger and weighted median MR. We
further adjusted for potential shared pathways with tobacco
consumption in multivariable MR. We additionally conducted
sensitivity analyses by restricting to SNPs with putative functional
roles and by sequentially excluding each SNP from the analysis.
Finally, we compared the causal estimate with a meta-analysis of
observational studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Observational analysis between ever use of cannabis and risk of
schizophrenia
Observational studies reporting an association between cannabis use and
risk of schizophrenia were selected from a recent and comprehensive
review of the literature (published in 2016) and a meta-analysis from 2007
reporting prospective studies of cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia.2,15
As only one study reported schizophrenia as an outcome,16 we slightly
broadened our inclusion criteria to also include studies reporting
related disorders (schizophreniform disorder and psychotic symptoms).
To identify additional studies that may be eligible for inclusion since the
meta-analysis from 2007, we conducted a PubMed search (Supplementary
Figure S1).
To compare with the causal estimate (see below), we restricted to studies
that reported ever use of cannabis (compared with never users of cannabis)
as an exposure and a corresponding risk estimate for schizophrenia or
related disorders. We identified four studies that met these criteria.16–19 We
found one additional study in which the definition of the exposure was
similar (any use of cannabis, provided that individuals have consumed
cannabis ⩾ 5 times) and also included it in the analysis.20 The pooled effect
estimate was derived using a random-effects meta-analysis of study
summary estimates. Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 summarize the main
characteristics of included and excluded studies, respectively.
Genetic markers associated with ever use of cannabis
We used the 10 leading SNPs from a recent GWAS (contributing studies
outlined in Supplementary Table S3), comprising data of participants
from European ancestry predominantly, on cannabis use (phenotype
defined as ever use of cannabis during participants’ lifetime) to obtain the
gene–exposure
(SNP–cannabis)
association
estimates
and
their
corresponding standard errors (s.e.) values (Supplementary Table S4).14
Although none of the SNPs surpassed a conventional genome-wide
significance threshold (P-values were between 4.6 × 10 − 7 and 3.1 × 10 − 6 in
the discovery analysis), estimates were directionally consistent across the
vast majority of contributing studies (Supplementary Table S4), and these
SNPs can individually, and cumulatively, be considered as valid instru-
ments for MR analysis.21
Association between cannabis-associated genetic markers and risk
of schizophrenia
The gene–outcome (SNP–risk of schizophrenia) association estimates were
obtained using the publicly available GWAS repository on schizophrenia
from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (http://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/
downloads). Supplementary Table S5 describes the contributing studies.
SNPs were directly matched with the 10 SNPs associated with ever use of
cannabis. The number of individuals and the relationships between
datasets are presented in Supplementary Figure S2. We used the same
reference allele for each SNP to orientate cannabis and schizophrenia
estimates.
Statistical analysis
MR analysis was conducted by first generating an instrumental variable
estimate for each SNP. The instrumental variable estimate for each SNP
was generated by dividing the association of each SNP with risk of
schizophrenia by the corresponding association with risk of ever use of
cannabis and the s.e. was estimated using the delta method.22 We pooled
instrumental variable estimates across SNPs using fixed-effect (inverse
variance weighted) meta-analysis. As a sensitivity analysis we also pooled
estimates using random-effects modelling. Estimates of the association of
each SNP with ever use of cannabis were not transformed. In order to
generate a MR estimate for ‘users vs non-users’ of cannabis (as opposed to
a per-1-log unit increase in ever use of cannabis), we transformed the
summary estimate from meta-analysis using estimates of risk of schizo-
phrenia in the population, and the prevalence of schizophrenia in never
users of cannabis, as previously described.23 A full description of the
methodology is provided in the Supplementary Information.
Characteristics of the genetic markers
Strength of instrument and power to detect a causal effect.
In MR analyses,
but especially in the context where multiple SNPs that did not achieve
GWAS significance are used cumulatively, there are certain characteristics
that need to be tested.
First, a concern might be weak instrument bias. Conventionally, when
using data sets that overlap for the SNP–exposure and SNP–outcome, this
can generate biased estimates and yield a spurious causal estimate (arising
from correlation of the error terms of SNP–exposure and SNP–outcome).24
However, in our case, there was only minimal overlap (o5%) between the
data sets used to derive the effect estimates for SNPs with ever use of
cannabis and risk of schizophrenia (Supplementary Figure S2), minimizing
the possibility of weak instrument bias yielding a false positive association.
In contrast to overlapping datasets where weak instrument bias can lead to
a false positive result, use of non-overlapping data sets in MR can lead to a
false negative association.24 This means that a positive result from a MR
analysis when using non-overlapping data sets protected from such bias.
We estimated instrument strength by calculating the proportion of
variance in use of cannabis explained by each SNP. We then derived the
F-statistic of each SNP individually and cumulatively (full details provided
in the Supplementary Information).
We estimated power to detect the same magnitude of association
reported in the observational studies, using a two-sided α of 0.05. Power
was 100% and is presented in Supplementary Table S6.
Assessment of directional pleiotropy.
We tested for presence of unmea-
sured pleiotropy of the genetic markers using MR-Egger as described by
Bowden et al.11 Essentially, this uses the same principles of testing for small
study bias in meta-analysis. The methodology was similar as for
conventional MR analysis (described above), with the exception that all
alleles (and corresponding estimates) were oriented in the direction of an
increase in the exposure before the analyses. The s.e. was obtained by
bootstrap resampling 10 000 times. As a sensitivity analysis, we measured
the relative bias in the MR-Egger causal effect estimate because of the
variance of the estimates of the SNP–cannabis association.25 Indeed, all MR
analyses rely on the assumption that the SNP–exposure association is true
(NO Measurement Error (NOME) assumption),25 but whenever the
SNP–exposure association estimates are imprecise, weak instrument bias
can distort the causal effect estimate. The I2 statistic, quantifying weak
instrument bias in the context of MR-Egger, was moderate (I2 = 67%;
potential bias of 43%). As described by Bowden et al.,25 we then applied
simulation extrapolation (implemented in R using the simex package) to
adjust the MR-Egger causal estimates to account for a potential NOME
violation.
We
also
conducted
a
penalized
weighted
median
MR
analysis
(implemented in Stata using the mrrobust package; available at: https://
github.com/remlapmot/mrrobust). This approach gives more weight to
genetic variants with homogeneous causal estimates (that is, close to the

1288
Molecular Psychiatry (2018), 1287 – 1292
 median causal estimate) even when up to 50% of the weight in the
analysis arises from invalid genetic markers.12
Sensitivity analyses
As tobacco consumption has been related to risk of schizophrenia and use
of tobacco shares a strong genetic correlation with use of cannabis in
Stringer et al.,8,14 we conducted a multivariable MR—to adjust for shared
pathways with and/or potential confounding by tobacco—using summary
statistics for the association of each of the 10 cannabis-related SNPs with
tobacco (ever vs never smokers) derived from 111 898 participants (51 984
ever smokers and 59 914 never smokers) from the UK Biobank (http://
www.ukbiobank.ac.uk). Selection of participants and genotyping are
described in the Supplementary Information. Multivariable MR was
conducted by regressing the SNP–cannabis estimates on SNP–schizo-
phrenia estimates adjusting for SNP–tobacco estimates.13 The s.e. was
obtained by bootstrap resampling 10 000 times.
We conducted two additional sensitivity analyses. First, we assessed the
robustness of the summary causal estimate to influence by individual
SNPs. This was done by: (1) sequentially removing each SNP from the MR
analysis (leave-one-out permutation analysis); (2) estimating studentized
residuals to assess whether any individual causal estimate was an outlier
(as proposed by Corbin et al.26); and (3) computing Cook’s distance to
identify influential SNPs on the overall model.
Second, we restricted the analyses to two SNPs (rs73067624 and
rs4471463) located within two genes (KCNT2 (1q31) and NCAM1 (11q23),
respectively) that were associated with ever use of cannabis in the gene-
based tests of associations in Stringer et al.14 These two genes are
potentially functional: KCNT2 encodes a potassium voltage-gated channel
that may play a role in addiction.14,27 Previous studies have found that
markers linked to KCNT2 are related to cocaine dependence and opioid
consumption.27 NCAM1 regulates pituitary growth hormone secretion and
is
implicated
in
dopaminergic
neurotransmission,14
and
has
been
associated with dependence to nicotine, alcohol and heroin.28
All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata v.13.1 (Stata, College
Station, TX, USA), except computation of I2 statistic and simulation
extrapolation analyses that were conducted using the statistical pro-
gramme R (version 3.3.1).
RESULTS
Observational association between ever use of cannabis and risk
of schizophrenia and related disorders
One prospective study met our primary research criteria and
reported that ever use of cannabis (compared with no use) was
associated with an odds ratio (OR) for schizophrenia of 1.50 (95%
confidence interval (CI), 1.10–2.00). When meta-analysing this
estimate with other prospective observational studies reporting
related traits, including schizophreniform disorder and psychotic
symptoms (encompassing a total of 1326 cases and 58 263
controls), ever use of cannabis was associated with a 43% increase
in the risk of schizophrenia or related disorders (OR, 1.43; 95% CI,
1.19–1.67; I2 = 0%) using random-effects modelling (Figure 1).
Causal effect of ever use of cannabis on risk of schizophrenia
The 10 SNPs associated with ever use of cannabis explained 1% of
its variance. There was a positive estimated effect between ever
use of cannabis and risk of schizophrenia (Supplementary
Figure S3). In MR analysis based on 34 241 cases of schizophrenia
and 45 604 controls, ever use of cannabis was causally associated
with risk of schizophrenia (OR per-1-log unit increase in ever use
of cannabis (derived by fixed-effect meta-analysis of individual
causal effects estimates of the SNPs), 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.14;
P-value = 0.007; Figure 2). Random-effects meta-analysis yielded
similar results (OR per-1-log unit increase in ever use of cannabis,
1.09; 95% CI, 1.02–1.16; P-value = 0.010). Applying population-
based estimates, this translated to a 37% increase in the risk of
schizophrenia (OR for users vs non-users of cannabis, 1.37; 95% CI,
1.09–1.67; Figure 3). The MR estimate was consistent with
estimates derived from observational analyses restricted to
schizophrenia alone (test for heterogeneity, χ2 = 0.23; P-value =
0.634) or schizophrenia and related disorders combined (test for
heterogeneity, χ2 = 0.10; P-value = 0.755; Figure 3).
Assessment of pleiotropic effects of the genetic markers
We did not find evidence against the null hypothesis of no
unmeasured pleiotropy of the genetic markers using MR-Egger
(P-value
for
pleiotropy = 0.292).
The
estimate
derived
from
MR-Egger
is

with
conventional

estimates
in
Supplementary Figures S4 and S5. Compared with conventional
MR results, weighted median MR produced very similar causal
estimate although with reduced precision. Supplementary Table S7

estimates.

Causal link between cannabis use and schizophrenia
J Vaucher et al
1289
Molecular Psychiatry (2018), 1287 – 1292
 Adjusting for the association of SNPs for smoking in multivariable
MR did not show evidence of shared pathways and/or confounding
with a causal effect estimate of schizophrenia from users of cannabis
that remained stable (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.09–1.83; Figure 3).
Sensitivity analyses
To further test the stability of the MR effect estimate to inclusion
of SNPs that could individually distort the genetic association
between
cannabis
use
and
schizophrenia,
we
sequentially
removed each SNP from the analysis. The direction and precision
of the summary association between ever use of cannabis and risk
of schizophrenia remained largely unchanged using this approach
(Figure 4). None of the individual estimates for each SNP was an
outlier using studentized residuals (Supplementary Figure S6) and
Cook’s distance showed that only two SNPs (rs2033867 and
rs7107977) had marginal influence level on the overall model
(Supplementary Figures S7 and S8). Furthermore, restricting the
analysis
to two
putative
functional
SNPs
(rs73067624
and
rs4471463) showed a persistent causal effect (OR for users vs
nonusers of cannabis, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.00–3.21; Supplementary
Figure S9).
DISCUSSION
Using a genetic approach, this study provides additional evidence
that cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of schizophrenia.
This finding corroborates many previous prospective observa-
tional studies that identified cannabis users to be at increased risk
of schizophrenia. As cannabis is the leading drug of misuse, this
finding is timely to draw attention to the potential mental health
consequences of cannabis use and to provide more robust
scientific evidence to inform the public health debate on cannabis
legalization.

Causal link between cannabis use and schizophrenia
J Vaucher et al
1290
Molecular Psychiatry (2018), 1287 – 1292
 During the past 30 years, epidemiological observations have
consistently demonstrated a strong, positive and dose-dependent
association
between
cannabis
use
and
risk
of
psychotic
disorders.2,15 The direction and the strength of the association
persisted after adjusting for measured confounders and with long
periods (∼25 years) of follow-up (to attempt to minimize
confounding and reverse causality bias, respectively). Our meta-
analysis of prospective observational studies confirmed these
findings in a magnitude that tallies remarkably closely with
previous reports.15 Despite the consistency of observational data,
clarifying whether or not cannabis use causally influences risk of
schizophrenia has remained challenging. This is because observa-
tional studies, even accounting for confounding factors, can be
affected by biases that undermine the validity (such as residual
confounding).2 As such, the ability to answer the question on
causality has been at an impasse, as a randomized controlled trial
(considered the gold standard to test a hypothesis) is not possible
for ethical reasons, as it would involve exposing participants to a
potentially harmful exposure (a similar scenario to examining
whether alcohol protects against risk of cardiovascular disease).29
In this setting, an MR approach can provide pivotal information on
causality that can be of public health importance and inform
guidelines.30 Our findings strongly support the large body of
evidence from observational studies that exposure to cannabis
plays a causal role in the development of schizophrenia.
Our findings are supported by studies that show that expression
of schizophrenia-associated cerebral cannabinoid receptors are
modified by cannabis use31 and that cortical maturation is altered
by cannabis use in adolescents.32 More compellingly, small
randomized trials involving human participants in laboratory
conditions suggest that exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
confers a risk to developing symptoms that mimic psychotic
disorders.6 Observationally and genetically, tobacco use is strongly
correlated with cannabis use and has been proposed to act
synergistically with cannabis to establish addiction.8 Moreover,
the association between cannabis and psychotic experiences
has been shown to be influenced by tobacco use, that is,
accounting for tobacco use reduces the cannabis–schizophrenia
relationship.33 Hence, the lack of attenuation in the MR estimate
when adjusting for by tobacco consumption, as tested in our
multivariable MR analysis, strengthens the findings of a primary
association between cannabis use and risk of schizophrenia.
Finally, our sensitivity analysis restricting to two genes with
presumptive functional roles in drug dependence may suggest
that cannabis affects addiction mechanisms that in turn influence
the risk of schizophrenia. However, against this theory is the
observation that other drugs of addiction are less associated to
risk of schizophrenia or related disorders.34 Moreover, any
influence of addictive mechanisms would not undermine our
findings, as cannabis exposure may be necessary to establish
dependence, and addiction mechanisms could lie on the same
causal pathway (Supplementary Figure S10).
Limitations include that our study did not permit investigation
of the risk of schizophrenia in relation to the quantity, type, route
of administration or indeed the age at exposure to cannabis.
Second, the precise mechanisms explaining how some of the
genetic markers under analysis alter cannabis use (or dependence)
remain unknown; however, this is not a necessary requirement to

the analysis did not reach conventional genome-wide association
significance thresholds. However, directions of effect in the

were
consistent
in
the
vast
majority
of
contributing studies (Supplementary Table S4) and combining
individual SNPs for an analysis such as this remains valid provided
the genetic instrument does not suffer from weak instrument bias.
In that regard, in the context of conducting summary-level MR
analysis using non-overlapping data sources for the exposure and
outcome (as we report here), weak instrument bias would bias the
effect towards the null (that is, opposite to weak instrument
bias in overlapping data sets).24 This greatly increases confidence
in the causal effect estimate that we report. Furthermore, our
sensitivity analyses identified that the causal estimates from MR
were robust to various approaches to test for stability of the causal
estimates. Fourth, MR-Egger and weighted median MR may have
been underpowered to detect directional pleiotropy of the
genetic instruments (if it were present).11 Nevertheless our

effect) of any individual SNP, based on the leave-one-out

Sensitivity analysis of the association of use of cannabis and risk of schizophrenia by sequentially removing each single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) from the analysis. The red vertical line represents the summary causal effect estimate (derived from Mendelian
randomization) when including the 10 SNPs in the analysis (presented in Figure 3). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
represent the population-based risk of schizophrenia in users of cannabis (compared with nonusers).

 permutation analysis (Figure 4) and excluding two SNPs with
potential
influence
on
the
overall
model
(Supplementary
Figure S8), showed that the causal estimate remained robust. It
is noteworthy that, despite these potential limitations, this study
represents the closest approximation to a randomized trial on the
effect of ever use of cannabis and risk of schizophrenia.
In summary, a genetic approach—representing an alternative to
assessing causality when a randomized controlled trial would be
unethical—strongly supports the hypothesis that use of cannabis
is causally related to risk of schizophrenia. This may help inform
public health debate on cannabis use and preventive strategies to
alleviate the burden of disease from schizophrenia.
