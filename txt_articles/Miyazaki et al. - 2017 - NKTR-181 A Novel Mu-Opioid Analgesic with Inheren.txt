ABSTRACT
The increasing availability of prescription opioid analgesics for the
treatment of pain has been paralleled by an epidemic of opioid
misuse, diversion, and overdose. The development of abuse-
deterrent formulations (ADFs) of conventional opioids such as
oxycodone and morphine represents an advance in the field
and has had a positive but insufficient impact, as most opioids
are still prescribed in highly abusable, non-ADF forms, and
abusers can tamper with ADF medications to liberate the abusable
opioid within. The abuse liability of mu-opioid agonists appears to be
dependent ontheir rapid rate of entry into the central nervous system
(CNS), whereas analgesic activity appears to be a function of CNS
exposure alone, suggesting that a new opioid agonist with an
inherently low rate of influx across the blood-brain barrier could
mediate analgesia with low abuse liability, regardless of formulation
or route of administration. NKTR-181 is a novel, long-acting, selective
mu-opioid agonist with structural properties that reduce its rate of
entry across the blood-brain barrier compared with traditional
mu-opioid agonists. NKTR-181 demonstrated maximum analgesic
activity comparable to that of oxycodone in hot-plate latency and
acetic-acid writhing models. NKTR-181 was distinguishable from
oxycodone by its reduced abuse potential in self-administration
and progressive-ratio break point models, with behavioral effects
similar to those of saline, as well as reduced CNS side effects as
measured by the modified Irwin test. The in vitro and in vivo
studies presented here demonstrate that NKTR-181 is the first
selective mu-opioid agonist to combine analgesic efficacy and
reduced abuse liability through the alteration of brain-entry
kinetics.
Introduction
Opioid analgesics have been used for centuries and remain
one of the most effective treatments for severe pain. Drugs in
this class activate specific opioid receptors in the central
nervous system (CNS) and the periphery, leading to anti-
nociceptive activity in animal models and pain relief in
humans (Inturrisi, 2002; Dickenson and Kieffer, 2005; Whiteside
et al., 2008). However, the use of opioid analgesics for the
treatment of chronic pain remains problematic because of the
narrow benefit/risk profile between analgesic efficacy and
undesirable CNS adverse effects, such as sedation and re-
spiratory depression (Spetea et al., 2010). Furthermore, the
euphorogenic and reinforcing effects of opioids carry with
them a high risk of addiction and misuse (Melnikova, 2010).
The development of a new pharmacotherapy that could take
advantage of this analgesic pathway but with inherently lower
abuse liability would be a major advance in the treatment of
chronic pain.
There appears to be a relationship between the brain uptake
rate and the abuse liability of traditional mu-opioid agonists
such as oxycodone and morphine. Generally, the more rapidly
a drug reaches efficacious levels in the brain to relieve pain,
the more rapid is the onset of additional CNS effects experi-
enced by the subject. This rapid onset of CNS effects can

 produce a feeling of euphoria and a concomitant increase in
drug likability, reinforcing behavior, and abuse liability (Farré
and Camí, 1991; Abreu et al., 2001; Marsch et al., 2001; Comer
et al., 2009; Webster et al., 2012; Webster and Smith, 2015).
Because the rate of mu-opioid receptor (MOR) occupancy by
mu agonists depends on the rate at which these compounds
cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), strategies to slow the rate
of mu-agonist uptake by the brain may produce a beneficial
cascade of effects limiting subjective feelings of euphoria and,
ultimately, reducing addictive qualities (U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, 2015). To date, pharmaceutical companies
have concentrated on development of extended-release, abuse-
deterrent formulations (ADFs) that work to slow the intestinal
absorption of traditional opioids, including oxycodone, hydro-
codone, and morphine, into the bloodstream. However, in
many instances, tampering can readily overcome ADFs. As a
result, the liberated opioid enters the brain at a high rate and
provides the reward sought by abusers.
Because abuse liability, but not analgesia, is dependent, at
least in part, on CNS pharmacokinetics (PK), we hypothesized
that separating these two effects could provide a superior
solution to the problem. Our objective was to develop a next-
generation opioid molecule with an inherently slow rate of
influx across the BBB into the CNS that retains the phar-
macodynamic activity of traditional mu-opioid agonists.
This approach could yield an analgesic with low abuse potential
independent of formulation and route of administration. Our efforts
resulted in the discovery of (5a,6a)-4,5-epoxy-6-(3,6,9,12,15,18-
hexaoxanonadec-1-yloxy)-3-methoxy-17-methylmorphinan-
14-ol (NKTR-181), a novel, long-acting, and selective mu-opioid
agonist with inherently low abuse potential currently in phase
3 development for the treatment of chronic pain. NKTR-181
not only demonstrated significant analgesic efficacy in patients
with chronic low-back pain (manuscript in preparation), but
this occurred concomitantly with reduced abuse potential in
humans compared with oxycodone (Webster et al., 2017).
Taken together, these clinical data suggest that NKTR-181
represents a potential paradigm shift in opioid therapy for
chronic pain, providing opioid-induced analgesia with low abuse
potential.
Here, we report for the first time the chemical structure of
NKTR-181 and compare the effects of NKTR-181 with those of
traditional mu-opioid agonists, with respect to rate of brain
uptake, receptor binding and function, PK, analgesic action,
CNS adverse effects, and drug liking/reinforcing effects. Our
preclinical findings demonstrate that NKTR-181 is a novel,
selective mu-opioid agonist with analgesic efficacy and re-
duced abuse liability compared with traditional opioid-agonist
pharmacotherapies.
Materials and Methods
Test Articles. Studies were performed using NKTR-181 hydro-
chloride salt (Nektar proprietary compound; Nektar Therapeutics,
San Francisco, CA), oxycodone hydrochloride (catalog number 01378;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), hydrocodone bitartrate salt (catalog
number H4516; Sigma-Aldrich), and morphine sulfate pentahydrate
(catalog number M8777; Sigma-Aldrich). Formulations for dosing inanimal
studies were prepared in saline at appropriate dosing concentrations.
In Situ Brain Perfusion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Hilltop
Laboratory Animals, Scottsdale, PA) weighing 250–300 g were
maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum food and
water, and housed two per cage. All testing was performed in
accordance with the policies and recommendations of the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the testing facility
(Absorption Systems, LP, Exton, PA). On the day of study, each rat
was anesthetized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a ketamine HCl/xylazine
HCl solution prior to implantation of a cannula into the left carotid
artery. Perfusion was performed using a single time-point method, in
which perfusate-containing control compounds (5.0 mM antipyrine and
50 mM atenolol) and test compound (10 or 100 mM) were infused into the
cannula for 30 seconds by infusion pump. After 30 seconds, the perfusion
was stopped, and the cerebral tissue was immediately removed from the
skull, cut sagittally in half, placed into a chilled tube, frozen on dry ice, and
stored at 260°C to 280°C until analysis. Each left hemisphere was thawed
and weighed for analysis. Methanol (20%) was added to each left hemi-
sphere at 4.0 ml/g tissue, and the mixture was homogenized by son-
ication (VirSonic Ultrasonic Cell Disruptor 100; The VirTis Company,
Gardiner, NY). Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass spec-
trometry (LC-MS/MS) analytical methods were used to quantify
analytes.
Caco-2 Permeability. Caco-2 monolayers were grown to conflu-
ence on collagen-coated, microporous, polycarbonate membranes in
12-well Costar Transwell plates (Corning, Inc., Corning, NY). The
permeability assay buffer for the donor chambers was Hanks’ balanced
salt solution containing 10 mM HEPES and 15 mM glucose at a pH of
7.4. The buffer in the receiver chambers also contained 1% bovine
serum albumin. The dosing solution concentration of the test com-
pounds was 10 mM in the assay buffer. In some studies, the assay
buffer and dosing solution contained 100 mM verapamil. Cell
monolayers were first preincubated for 30 minutes with assay buffer to
presaturate P-glycoprotein (P-gp) sites with verapamil. After 30 minutes,
the buffer was removed, and the cell monolayers were dosed on the
apical (A to B) or basolateral side (B to A) and incubated at 37°C with 5%
CO2 in a humidified incubator. After 2 hours, aliquots were taken from
the receiver and donor chambers. Each determination was performed in
duplicate. To ensure that no damage was inflicted to the cell monolayers
during the flux period, we also measured the Lucifer Yellow flux for each
monolayer. All samples were assayed by LC-MS/MS using electrospray
ionization.
The apparent permeability (Papp) and percentage recovery were
calculated as follows:

ment in cm3; A is the area of the cell monolayer (1.13 cm2 for a 12-well
Transwell), CN is the nominal dosing concentration of the dosing
solution in mM, CA is the average of the nominal dosing concentration
and the measured 120-minute donor concentration in mM, Cr
final is the
receiver concentration in mM at the end of the incubation period, and
Cd
final is the concentration of the donor in mM at the end of the
incubation period.
The recovery typically was between 75% and 88%. This study was
conducted at Absorption Systems.
Rodent PK. Test articles were dosed either as a single intrave-
nous (tail vein) bolus injection or via oral gavage to overnight-fasted
rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Hollis-
ter, CA) weighing between 240 and 280 g were maintained on a
12-hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum food and water. All testing
was performed in accordance with the policies and recommendations
of the IACUC of the testing facility (SRI International, Menlo Park,
CA). For each time point, a minimum of three animals received either
NKTR-181 or oxycodone at the indicated dose levels. At predeter-
mined time points, blood was collected in K2EDTA-coated microtainer
tubes. For rat brain PK, animals were exsanguinated and then

 perfused via the left ventricle with 60 ml of ice-cold saline to remove
blood from the organ. Plasma was separated from blood after
centrifugation (10,000g for 5 minutes) and kept frozen at 270°C until
analysis. Cerebral tissue was removed, weighed, frozen on dry ice, and
stored at 270°C until analysis. Proteins from tissue homogenates and
plasma samples (100 ml each) were removed by precipitation after
adding 300 ml of cold acetonitrile. Samples were then centrifuged and
analyzed using a qualified LC-MS/MS method in the multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) mode. Chromatographic separation was performed
using an optimized isocratic composition of 0.1% formic acid in 10 mM
ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) as mobile phase A and 0.2% formic acid in
10:90 water:acetonitrile as mobile phase B.
Noncompartmental analysis was conducted using PhoenixWinNon-
lin (version 6.4; Pharsight, Mountain View, CA) to obtain PK
parameters. Nominal doses and sampling times were used. Maximum
plasma concentration (Cmax) and time of observed maximum plasma
concentration (Tmax) were derived from the input data set. The area
under the plasma concentration–time curves (AUC) were calculated
using linear-log trapezoidal interpolation and sparse sampling mode
and uniform weighing. Terminal half-life was used for extrapolation to
infinity (AUCinf). Clearance, volume of distribution at steady state
(Vss), and terminal half-life (t1/2) were determined for NKTR-181 and
oxycodone. Percentage absolute bioavailability was estimated as
follows: dose-normalized AUCinf (p.o.)/AUCinf (i.v.) � 100.
The rate of in vivo uptake (Kin) was estimated following an
intravenous bolus injection at 10 minutes postdose according to eq. 3:

where Abrain is the amount (ng) in the brain at 10 minutes, and
AUC0–10, plasma (min*ng/ml) is the area under the plasma curve from
t 5 0 to 10 minutes postdose.
In Vitro Opioid Receptor Binding. Competitive displacement
studies were conducted using commercially available membranes
prepared from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells heterologously
expressing recombinant human mu-, delta-, or kappa-opioid recep-
tors (PerkinElmer, Richmond, CA). [3H]Naloxone, [3H]DPDPE, and
[3H]diprenorphine were used as the radioligands for mu, delta, and kappa
receptors, respectively. Membranes containing the receptor of interest
were incubated with increasing concentrations of test compound in the
presence of a single concentration of radioligand. The fixed concen-
tration of the radioligand used was at the reported Kd for the receptor.
Serial dilutions of the test compound were prepared, and each
concentration was tested in triplicate. Nonspecific binding was
measured in the presence of excess naloxone; this value was sub-
tracted from the total binding to yield the specific binding at each test
concentration. Calculations for saturation binding, 50% inhibition
(IC50), and Ki were determined using published calculations (Cheng
and Prusoff, 1973; Leslie, 1987; Motulsky and Christopoulos, 2004;
McKinney and Raddatz, 2006). Data were analyzed using GraphPad
Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).
In Vitro Opioid Receptor Function. In vitro intrinsic efficacy
was evaluated by measuring the reduction of cAMP levels (inhibition
of cAMP formation) in forskolin-stimulated CHO cells that heterolo-
gously express the cloned human mu-, kappa-, or delta-opioid receptors
(Nektar Therapeutics). The cells were pretreated with buffer containing
the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and then
with forskolin and varying concentrations of morphine, oxycodone,
hydrocodone, or NKTR-181, with each concentration tested in triplicate.
Inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation was measured using
a cAMP HiRange homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay that is
based on the principle of a competitive immunoassay (catalog number
62 AM6PEC; Cisbio, Bedford, MA). Results were calculated from the
fluorescence ratio (665/620 nm). The EC50 was calculated using XLfit4
software (IDBS, Boston, MA).
Acetic-Acid Writhing Test. The acetic-acid writhing test of
visceral pain in the mouse was used to assess acute antinociceptive
effects. Male Swiss Webster (CD-1) mice (Charles River Laboratories,
Hollister, CA) weighing ∼20 g at the start of the study were housed five
per cage and maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum
food and water. All testing was performed during the light cycle and in
accordance with the policies and recommendations of the IACUC of
the testing facility (SRI International). Mice received NKTR-181 or
oxycodone orally at doses of 0 (saline), 1, 3, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg
(n 5 10/dose level). One hour after administration of test articles, mice
were given an i.p. injection of 0.5% acetic acid in water (10 ml/kg) to
induce writhing. Writhing included the following behaviors: contrac-
tions of the abdomen, twisting and turning of the trunk, arching of the
back, and extension of the hindlimbs. Naïve animals were randomly
assigned to groups on the day of dose, and each observer was blinded to
the treatment groups. After the i.p. injection, the animals were placed
in clear plastic beakers and their behavior observed. Single writhing
episodes were counted during a 20-minute period immediately after
the i.p. injection. Immediately after the end of the behavioral study,
animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and blood samples were
taken. After blood sampling, animals were euthanized by cervical
dislocation. Statistical significance for dose response was evaluated
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Dunnett’s post-test with
respect to saline using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.).
The ED50 was calculated using WinNonlin 5.2.1, Model 104
(Pharsight, Mountain).
Hot-Plate Latency. Analgesic efficacy to thermal nociception was
evaluated using the hot-plate latency test. Male Swiss Webster (CD-1)
mice (Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh, NC) weighing 16–20 g at
the start of the study were housed 10 per cage and maintained on a
12-hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum food and water. For the rat
time-course study, male CD IGS rats (Charles River Laboratories,
Raleigh, NC) weighing 101–125 g were received, housed four per cage,
and maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum food and
water for 1 week before the start of the study. All testing was
performed during the light cycle and in accordance with the IACUC
of the testing facility (Howard Associates, LLC, Durham, NC).
Compound (NKTR-181 or oxycodone) was administered orally, and
30 minutes later we measured hot-plate latency (time to response by
licking hind paw or jumping) after placement on a 55°C hot plate.
A saline control was included and evaluated at 1 hour postdose. The
time to lick or jump was recorded; however, if no lick or jump occurred
within 30 seconds, the animal was removed and 30 seconds was
recorded as response latency. Testers were blinded to the treat-
ment groups. Immediately after the last time point, the mouse was
euthanized by CO2 inhalation, and samples were collected for PK
analysis (data not shown). Statistical significance for dose response
was evaluated using one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s post-test with
respect to saline. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used to
evaluate time-course response. Statistical significance was indi-
cated where P , 0.05 (two-tailed test). The ED50 was calculated
with the lower bound at the saline mean and the upper bound at the
cutoff point, 30 seconds. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software Inc.).
Modified Irwin Test. The modified Irwin test consisted of
observations of CNS-mediated behavior (Roux et al., 2005). Naïve
male Swiss Webster (CD-1) mice (Charles River Laboratories,
Raleigh, NC) weighing 16–18 g at the start of the study were housed
10 per cage and maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with ad
libitum food and water. All testing was performed during the light
cycle and in accordance with the policies and recommendations of the
IACUC of the testing facility (Howard Associates, LLC). NKTR-181,
oxycodone, or saline was administered orally, and each mouse was
placed immediately in the observation chamber. At each time point,
undisturbed observations were made for gross signs of hyper- or
hypoactivity, Straub tail (rigidity in the tail that is commonly observed
in mice administered with opioid agonists), hindlimb splay, tremor,
and seizure. Then, each mouse was handled for evaluation of muscle
tone (rigid or not), pinna reflex (presence or absence), righting reflex
(intact or lost), and placing (whether or not the forepaws were

 extended when the mouse was placed near the surface). On the next
day, each mouse was inspected for any gross physiologic abnormality,
and then immediately euthanized by CO2 inhalation.
Rotarod. Locomotor coordination was evaluated using the rotarod
test. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Hollis-
ter, CA) weighing between 240 and 280 g were housed two to three per
cage and maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum food
and water. All testing was performed during the light cycle and in
accordance with the policies and recommendations of the IACUC of
the testing facility (SRI International). Naïve rats were trained to run
on the treadmill for 2 consecutive days before the day of study, when
trained animals were placed on the rotarod and baseline scores
recorded. After baseline assessment, animals were randomized into
groups and received oral doses of saline, oxycodone (10–100 mg/kg), or
NKTR-181 (10–300 mg/kg). Then, each rat’s performance on the
rotarod was evaluated 30 and 60 minutes later. The tester was blinded
to the treatment groups. The rod rotation was set at a constant speed
of 4g for 15 seconds, then set to accelerate from 4 to 40g over a
5-minute period. The time (in seconds) at which each animal stopped
running and fell off the rotarod was recorded as the time spent on the
rotarod. Animals that ran for 300 seconds were taken off the rotarod
and 300 seconds was recorded. Statistical significance was evaluated
using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test
with respect to saline. Statistical significance was indicated where
P , 0.05 (two-tailed test). Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software Inc.).
Abuse Potential: Self-Administration and Progressive Ra-
tio. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Portage,
MI) were received at approximately 7.5 weeks of age, and studies were
conducted at MPI Research, Inc. (Mattawan, MI). All animals were
surgically implanted with chronic indwelling jugular catheters per
Charles River Laboratories standard operating procedures, using
specialized catheters provided by MPI Research, Inc. Animals were
housed individually and maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with
ad libitum food and water. One week after receipt, access to food was
limited to maintain animals at 85%–95% of the free-feeding weight
during lever-pressing training, with supplemental feedings earned
during training operant sessions, as assessed once during the study.
During applicable operant sessions, animals received Dustless Pre-
cision Pellets, 45 mg, Rodent Grain-Based Diet (Bio-Serv, Flemington,
NJ). All training and testing were conducted during the light cycle.
Training and generalization were conducted as described in the
literature (Gauvin et al., 2015). In brief, once animals were trained to
respond consistently under the fixed-ratio four with food (four
consecutive lever presses per food reward), then animals were
transitioned to respond to cocaine infusion (0.56 mg/kg per infusion).
Cocaine is a standard substance for initial reinforcement training in
this model, and the particular history used to establish reinforcement
behavior does not affect the later behavior shown in the test
compounds (e.g., oxycodone and NKTR-181). Infusion training ses-
sions were terminated after a maximum of approximately 1 hour in
duration and a maximum of 10 rewards. After training, animals that
consistently provided 10 responses for each cocaine infusion (FR10),
with less than 20% day-to-day variation over 3 consecutive days, were
used for the study.
Self-administration was evaluated during the testing and sub-
stitution sessions; the parameter reported for abuse liability indica-
tion is total number of infusions during the session. Exposures to
saline or cocaine were considered test sessions, and exposures to the
test compounds were considered substitution sessions. Test and
substitution sessions were identical to training sessions except for
the drug or drug dose that was self-administered, and no restriction
was placed on the number of rewards attainable. Operant testing
sessions were interspersed between cocaine maintenance training
sessions. In the substitution sessions, NKTR-181 was administered at
0.032, 0.1, 0.32, 1.0, and 3.2 mg/kg per infusion. Oxycodone was
administered at 0.0032, 0.01, 0.032, and 0.1 mg/kg per infusion. All
treatments were administered at a dose volume less than 1 ml per
infusion. Six animals were tested per dose level. Animals tested were
exposed to each treatment condition once per day for three consecutive
sessions.
The progressive-ratio break points were determined by the highest
number of responses emitted by the animal to receive a single drug
delivery. In the progressive-ratio schedule, the total number of lever-
press responses required for each subsequent drug delivery was
incremented using a logarithmic (base e) scale using the following
equation:
response requirement 5 5*eðresponse increment*0:2Þ–5
After the maintenance training session, a second substitution test
was conducted under the progressive-ratio schedule of drug delivery.

Results
NKTR-181 Has a Reduced Rate of Brain Entry
Relative to Traditional Opioid Agonists. We previously
reported that derivatives of morphine-like (morphinan) scaf-
folds containing short-chain polyethylene glycol functional
groups have altered oral bioavailability and reduced penetra-
tion across the BBB (Corsetti and Tack, 2015; Bui et al.,
2016a,b). We extended this work to screen a library of polymer-
containing morphinan opioid agonists for their activity, bio-
availability, and kinetics of BBB penetration. We selected
NKTR-181 from these compounds as the first exemplar of this
new class of opioid agonists with reduced influx into the CNS
in vivo (Fig. 1).
Rates of brain uptake (Kin) for NKTR-181 and traditional
opioids were determined by measuring relative concentra-
tions in the brain after a 30-second, single perfusion at 10 or
100 mM in the rat (in situ brain perfusion; Table 1). Oxy-
codone, a readily brain-penetrant opioid, displayed consistent
uptake values at both concentrations. Hydrocodone had re-
duced brain uptake compared with oxycodone, but was still
measurable in the brain at appreciable amounts (507 6
192 pmol/g). NKTR-181 had a reduced rate of brain entry
compared with oxycodone and hydrocodone, measuring

 71-fold less than oxycodone and 13-fold less than hydrocodone
(Table 1).
The observed reduction in rate of brain entry for NKTR-181
compared with oxycodone in rats (Table 1) correlated with
both reduced permeability and increased P-gp–mediated
efflux, which we observed in experiments showing reduced
flux across a Caco-2 cell monolayer (Table 2). Although
100 mM verapamil completely neutralized P-gp–mediated
efflux across Caco-2 monolayers, it is noteworthy that the
intrinsic permeability of NKTR-181 is approximately one
order of magnitude less than that of oxycodone. Therefore,
the rate of entry of NKTR-181 into the brain is expected to be
considerably slower than that of oxycodone, even in the
presence of physiologically attainable P-gp inhibitor plasma
concentrations.
This reduced rate of brain uptake of NKTR-181 was
replicated using rat PK, measuring brain concentrations after
intravenous doses. Kin, determined by measuring brain con-
centrations over time, was more than 17-fold less for NKTR-181
than for oxycodone (0.007 vs. 0.124 ml/min, respectively;
Table 3). In addition, rat PK experiments showed that
oral bioavailability was approximately 9-fold greater for
NKTR-181 compared with oxycodone (34% vs. 4%, respectively;
Table 3).
NKTR-181 Has Full Functional Activity and Selec-
tivity at the MOR. NKTR-181 displayed higher binding
affinity at the MOR than at the kappa- and delta-opioid
receptors. At the MOR, the affinity of NKTR-181 was less than
the affinities of traditional opioids (morphine and oxycodone),
between 15- and 28-fold less potent. The traditional MOR
agonists exhibit full displacement of [3H]naloxone, and we
observed the same result for NKTR-181 (Table 4).
Activation of Gi-coupled receptor, including opioid recep-
tors, leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase and decreased
accumulation of cAMP (Seamon et al., 1981; Milligan and
Kostenis, 2006). In forskolin-stimulated CHO cells heterolo-
gously expressing the human MOR, NKTR-181 produced a
concentration-dependent inhibition of cAMP accumulation
with an EC50 value of 12.5 6 3.4 mM (mean 6 S.D.), as well
as full agonist activity, with maximal efficacy at saturating
concentrations comparable to that of the other traditional mu
agonists (Table 5). There was no measurable inhibition of
cAMP accumulation with NKTR-181 when tested at the
kappa- and delta-opioid receptors at concentrations up to
500 mM. These data demonstrate that NKTR-181 acts as a full
agonist with high selectivity for MOR, and supports the
hypothesis that NKTR-181 mediates its opioid-like effects
in vivo by activation of endogenous MORs.
NKTR-181
Delivers
Full
Analgesic
Activity
with
Durable Effect. To evaluate the centrally mediated analge-
sic activity via the MOR, we analyzed NKTR-181 in two
typical models (writhing and hot-plate tests). As evaluated
using the mouse acetic-acid writhing test, oral administration
of NKTR-181 achieved complete inhibition of writhing re-
sponse (as did oral administration of oxycodone), with an
estimated ED50 of 8.9 mg/kg at 1 hour postinjection (Fig. 2). In
the mouse hot-plate test, full analgesic efficacy was similar to
that of oxycodone; maximal latency was achieved at the
highest dose tested 30 minutes after oral administration
(Fig. 3).
For the time-course study, we evaluated NKTR-181 and
oxycodone in mouse and rat hot-plate tests. For the mouse
time-course study, data from the 30-minute time point were
used to estimate ED50 values (68 mg/kg for NKTR-181 and
2.3 mg/kg for oxycodone, Fig. 3), and hot-plate latency of that
dose was measured at additional time points (0.5, 1, 2, 4,
and 6 hours postdose). The response latency of NKTR-181 at
0.5-hour postdose persisted during the 6-hour test time (Fig. 4A).
In addition, the effect of NKTR-181 and oxycodone was
significantly different [two-way ANOVA F(1, 9) 5 31.04,
P 5 0.0003]. This durable analgesic effect was reproduced in the
rat hot-plate test. NKTR-181 (170 mg/kg) had a significant anal-
gesic effect up to 4 hours after a single dose (statistical significance
to saline at 4 hours: P 5 0.0028), whereas the analgesic action of
oxycodone (17 mg/kg) lasted for a maximum of 1 hour (statis-
tical significance to saline at 1 hour: P 5 0.0002; Fig. 4B).

 NKTR-181 Demonstrates an Acceptable CNS-Mediated
Adverse Event Profile at Efficacious Analgesic Doses.
Although mu agonists are useful in pain management, this
class of drug is associated with severe adverse events,
including sedation. Here, we assessed CNS-mediated effects
of NKTR-181 on mouse behavior using the modified Irwin
test. Behavioral abnormalities were less prominent for
NKTR-181 in both the number of incidents within a specific
behavior and the variety of observed CNS-related behavioral
responses compared with oxycodone. Incidence of Straub tail
required a 300-mg/kg dose of NKTR-181—300-fold higher
(158-fold higher molar equivalent dose) than oxycodone
(Fig. 5).
In the rat rotarod test, oxycodone showed impairment of
motor coordination at 0.5 hour postdose even at the lowest
dose tested, 10 mg/kg (P , 0.05), and the maximal impairment
was reached at 30 mg/kg. However, NKTR-181 treatment
resulted in moderate locomotor coordination defects compared
with saline at 0.5 hour postdose (P , 0.05) and at 1 hour
postdose (P , 0.001) only at the highest tested dose, 300 mg/kg
(Fig. 6).
NKTR-181 Demonstrates Less Abuse Potential Com-
pared
with
Oxycodone. Administration
of
NKTR-181
showed no evidence of reinforcing behavior in rats in a well
established behavioral model of abuse potential. In an assess-
ment of self-administration, NKTR-181 did not serve as a
positive reinforcer of initiation or maintenance of lever-press
responding for test doses up to 1000-fold higher than those
needed to engender lever-press responding by oxycodone
(Fig. 7).
Direct intravenous infusions of NKTR-181 demonstrated an
effect similar to that of saline, even at the highest concentra-
tions tested, with a clear and distinct downward-staircase
extinction pattern of lever-press responding on subsequent
days. Despite high intravenous concentrations of NKTR-181
(.5000 nmol/kg), the drug did not produce reinforcing effects
in this assay. In contrast, 9.1 nmol/kg oxycodone maintained
self-administration. The bell-shaped response observed with
reduced self-administration at the highest concentration of
oxycodone is common to all drugs of abuse. At the highest
doses, direct motor effects of the drug begin to affect behav-
ioral patterns of self-administration (Gauvin et al., 2015).
These lower rates of self-administration with NKTR-181
were also reflected in a reduced propensity or motivation to
work increasingly harder to receive subsequent infusions of
NKTR-181 in a progressive-ratio model (Fig. 8). Progressive-
ratio “break points” were used to determine the relative work
(consecutive lever presses) an animal was willing to exert to
receive a single dose of drug. This is a standard method for
evaluating and comparing the relative reinforcing efficacy or
hedonic valence of drugs, which directly correlates with their
abuse liability (Panlilio and Goldberg, 2007). Unlike cocaine
and oxycodone, for which rats were willing to perform a
heightened number of lever presses to receive additional
infusions, NKTR-181 displayed behavior similar to that seen
with saline, even at milligram-per-kilogram doses 320-fold
higher than the lower dose of oxycodone.

with respect to saline (*P , 0.05; **P , 0.01; ***P , 0.001). Ratio of molar
equivalent doses for NKTR-181 to oxycodone is 1.8 to 1.

 Discussion
Prescription opioid analgesics are an effective and neces-
sary means of treating severe acute and chronic pain, but their
abuse, misuse, and diversion have become an epidemic of
national and international proportions (Manchikanti et al.,
2012; Rudd et al., 2016). The speed at which traditional opioid
agonists, such as oxycodone, enter the brain has a significant
impact on abuse potential (Raffa et al., 2012). Current
strategies to address abuse liability rely on extended-release
formulations to slow the rate of systemic absorption through
the gut, ultimately slowing brain absorption and reducing the
impact of opioid-associated euphoria. However, once the active
opioid agonist enters the circulation, any benefit achieved
by the formulation is lost as the released opioid, whether from
an extended- or immediate-release formulation, behaves
the same: rapidly crossing the BBB and entering the CNS.
Thus, extended-release formulations retain the potential to
be misused when the opioid contained within them is recov-
ered through tampering and/or introduced rapidly into the
circulation by alternative routes of administration, such as
insufflation or intravenous injection.
In our approach, we invented a next-generation opioid
agonist, which, based on its physicochemical properties, has
a significantly reduced rate of flux across the BBB compared
with traditional opioid-agonist medicines. The addition of a
polyethylene glycol functional group to a small molecule
changes not only its oral availability, but also its distribution
across the BBB. This feature is demonstrated by the activity of
naloxegol (Movantik; Astra Zeneca, Cambridge, UK), which is
effectively restricted to peripheral tissues outside of the CNS
(Corsetti and Tack, 2015; Bui et al., 2016a,b). In NKTR-181,
addition of a polyethylene glycol side chain to a morphine-like
(morphinan) pharmacophore confers a slower rate of brain
uptake than traditional opioids while retaining activity as a
selective mu-opioid agonist.

 NKTR-181 has a 17- to 70-fold lower rate of brain entry
in rats as compared with oxycodone, which is the result of
a combination of reduced permeability and increased
P-gp–mediated efflux at the BBB. Importantly, no chemical
or physical tampering method has yet been identified that can
alter the NKTR-181 molecule to an active form that has a
higher rate of entry into the CNS. In fact, to date, all efforts to
chemically manipulate the molecule (Cone et al., 2013) so as to
remove the polymer functional group have degraded the
pharmacophore, rendering it inactive as a mu-opioid agonist
(data not shown). In accordance with U.S. Food and Drug
Administration guidelines, these findings were confirmed by a
third-party laboratory (Drugscan, Horsham, PA).
NKTR-181 is a full MOR agonist in vitro and achieved
maximum analgesic efficacy in mouse models equivalent to
treatment with oxycodone. In the mouse acetic-acid writhing
model, 1-hour postdose NKTR-181 had an ED50 1.8-fold higher
(molar equivalent) compared with oxycodone, whereas in the
hot-plate latency assay at 0.5-hour postdose, the ED50 was
16-fold higher (molar equivalent) for NKTR-181 compared
with oxycodone. The unique physicochemical properties of
NKTR-181 also impart an extended PK profile in the circula-
tion compared with oxycodone, effectively eliminating the
need for an extended-release formulation for NKTR-181 with
twice-daily dosing. When dosed at its 0.5-hour postdose ED50,
NKTR-181 demonstrated a prolonged analgesic effect for up to
6 hours. This result reflects the improved oral bioavailability
and extended PK profile of NKTR-181 compared with
oxycodone.
Most importantly perhaps, the nonanalgesic CNS effects of
NKTR-181 are relatively mild at therapeutic (analgesic) dose
levels. CNS-mediated adverse effects on mouse behavior, as
measured using the modified Irwin test, were not observed
at doses below 100 mg/kg and were very limited even at the
300-mg/kg dose. To put this observation into perspective,
NKTR-181 had an ED50 of 68 mg/kg at 0.5 hour in the mouse hot-
plate latency assay, with substantial analgesic efficacy at 2 hours
postdose (the same time point at which the modified Irwin test
was conducted). These findings demonstrate that NKTR-181
has an acceptable CNS adverse effect profile at efficacious
analgesic doses. In comparison, oxycodone had an ED50 of
2.3 mg/kg at 0.5-hour postdose in the hot-plate latency assay,
but in the modified Irwin test, also measured at 0.5 hour
postdose, oxycodone showed CNS-mediated behavioral effects
starting at 1.0 mg/kg. These data indicate that NKTR-181 has
an improved therapeutic ratio for CNS adverse effects in mice
compared with oxycodone. Despite higher peripheral expo-
sures of NKTR-181, inhibition of gastrointestinal transit in
mice was comparable to that observed with equianalgesic
doses of oxycodone.
Consistent with our hypothesis, self-administered NKTR-181
did not produce any significant reinforcing effects even at
concentrations exceeding 500-fold (molar equivalents) over
those concentrations of oxycodone that maintained stable self-
administration behavior. This was also reflected in the
progressive-ratio “break points” study (measuring the relative
work an animal was willing to exert to receive NKTR-181) in
which NKTR-181 showed predominantly low progressive-
ratio break points similar to saline, even at concentrations
exceeding 170-fold (molar equivalents) those for oxycodone.
These data demonstrate that NKTR-181 has reduced abuse
potential in rats compared with oxycodone.
In understanding the abuse liability of the mu-agonist class
of opioid drugs, it is important to consider the critical relation-
ship between signal transduction through the MOR, which by
inhibiting GABAergic interneurons in the ventral tegmental
area increases dopamine release and activity of dopamine-
responsive neurons in the reward centers (e.g., nucleus
accumbens) of the CNS. Although we did not measure MOR
occupancy or rate of dopamine release in this study, it is
reasonable to speculate from the results of our behavioral data
that the inherent PK properties of NKTR-181 may reduce its
downstream effects on MOR occupancy and dopamine activity
relative to traditional opioids. The consequence is that there is
a reduction of the abuse potential of NKTR-181 and significant
overall improvement of its pharmaceutical profile compared
with traditional opioids. That these effects are influenced
primarily by kinetic considerations is evidenced by the
equivalent maximal analgesic efficacy of NKTR-181 and
oxycodone.
The data we have presented here are from analgesic and
behavioral studies that were conducted only on male animals.
However, it has been reported in both animals and humans
that the analgesic potency of opioids is affected by sex and

mice displaying each behavior at a respective dose (n = 2/group; green = no mice, yellow = 1 mouse, red = 2 mice). Time of maximal behavioral observation

tone (rigid or not), Straub tail (tail is rigid and erect), loss pinna (absence of ear reflex), loss right (loss of righting reflex), and loss place (loss of forepaw
extension when mouse is placed near a surface). Ratio of molar equivalent doses for NKTR-181 to oxycodone is 1.8 to 1. Molar conversions of doses tested:
1 (2.8 mmol/kg oxycodone, 1.6 mmol/kg NKTR-181), 3 (8.5 mmol/kg oxycodone, 4.7 mmol/kg NKTR-181), 10 (28 mmol/kg oxycodone, 16 mmol/kg NKTR-181),
30 (85 mmol/kg oxycodone, 47 mmol/kg NKTR-181), 100 (280 mmol/kg oxycodone, 160 mmol/kg NKTR-181), and 300 mg/kg (850 mmol/kg oxycodone,
470 mmol/kg NKTR-181).

 gender (Kest et al., 2000). Therefore, further evaluation of
female animals would need to be conducted to generalize these
data for all animals (Greenspan et al., 2007). Most impor-
tantly, these preclinical data for NKTR-181 have translated
well in the clinic for both men and women. Thus, phase 1 and
human abuse potential studies showed slower onset of CNS
effects, e.g., miosis (comparing times between peak plasma
concentration and maximal pupil constriction) and minimal
drug likability (Webster et al., 2017). Furthermore, analgesic
efficacy characteristic of long-acting mu-opioid agonists was
recently demonstrated by NKTR-181 in a pivotal human study of
chronic low-back pain (Markman J, manuscript in preparation).
In summary, we have demonstrated that NKTR-181 is a
long-acting, selective mu-opioid agonist with analgesic effi-
cacy comparable to that of oxycodone, but with a significantly
reduced rate of CNS uptake, independent of gut absorption
rate. Significantly reduced effects on drug reinforcement and
abuse potential were consistent with growing scientific evi-
dence suggesting that rates of CNS uptake and reinforcement
behavior contribute to drug addiction. NKTR-181 represents
the first example of an effective opioid analgesic with sub-
stantially reduced abuse liability due to reduced rate of CNS
uptake, which is entirely dependent on its inherent structural
properties, rather than extended-release ADF.

Fig. 8. NKTR-181 displays behavior comparable to saline in the
progressive-ratio break point study. Doses of infusion were as follows: cocaine
(COC) (0.56 mg/kg/infusion), oxycodone (OXY) (0.01 and 0.032 mg/kg/infu-
sion), and NKTR-181 (0.032, 0.1, 0.32, 1.0, and 3.2 mg/kg/infusion). Values
are expressed as mean 6 S.E.M. Ratio of molar equivalent doses for
NKTR-181 to oxycodone is 1.8 to 1. Molar conversions of doses tested are
as follows: 0.01 (28 nmol/kg oxycodone), 0.032 (91 nmol/kg oxycodone,
51 nmol/kg NKTR-181), 0.1 (160 nmol/kg NKTR-181), 0.32 (510 nmol/kg
NKTR-181), 1.0 (1582 nmol/kg NKTR-181), and 3.2 mg/kg (5100 nmol/kg
NKTR-181).
