This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* during 
October 2–December 17, 2016.† Influenza activity in the 
United States remained low in October and has been slowly 
increasing since November. Influenza A viruses were identified 
most frequently, with influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominat-
ing. Most influenza viruses characterized during this period 
were genetically or antigenically similar to the reference viruses 
representing vaccine components recommended for produc-
tion in the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.
Virologic Surveillance
U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) and National 
Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) 
laboratories include both clinical and public health labora-
tories throughout the United States that carry out virologic 
surveillance for influenza. During October 2–December 17, 
2016, clinical laboratories in the United States tested 177,867 
respiratory specimens for influenza viruses, 5,157 (2.9%) of 
which were positive (Figure 1); among identified viruses, 3,786 
(73.4%) were influenza A and 1,371 (26.6%) were influenza B. 
Among influenza positive results reported by clinical labo-
ratories, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
region 4§ (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee) accounted 
for 2,210 (42.9 %) of all influenza positive results and 911 
(66.4 %) of all influenza B viruses reported.
Public health laboratories in the United States tested 12,496 
respiratory specimens collected during October 2–December 17, 
2016. Among these, 2,103 were positive for influenza (Figure 2), 
including 1,930 (91.8%) that were positive for influenza A viruses 
and 173 (8.2%) that were positive for influenza B viruses. Among 
the 1,824 influenza A specimens subtyped, 95 (5.2%) were 
influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and 1,729 (94.8%) were influenza A 
(H3N2). Among the 97 influenza B viruses for which lineage 
was determined, 39 (40.2%) belonged to the B/Yamagata lin-
eage and 58 (59.8%) belonged to the B/Victoria lineage. Since 
October 2, 2016, influenza-positive tests have been reported from 
all U.S. Department of Health and Human Services regions.
Age was reported for 1,851 influenza-positive patients, 
among whom 140 (7.6%) were children aged 0–4 years, 
608 (32.8%) were aged 5–24 years, 599 (32.4%) were 
aged 25–64 years, and 504 (27.2%) were aged ≥65 years. 
Influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated in each age group, 
representing a range of 67.9% of influenza positives in persons 
aged 0–4 years to 86.5% in persons aged ≥65 years.
Novel Influenza A Viruses
One human infection with a novel influenza A virus was 
reported during October 2–December 17, 2016. The infection 
was reported by Iowa for the week ending November 19, 2016. 
The person was infected with an influenza A (H1N2) variant 
[(H1N2)v] virus¶ and was not hospitalized. Exposure to swine 
in the week preceding illness was reported, and there was no 
evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission of the virus.
Antigenic and Genetic Characterization of 
Influenza Viruses
WHO collaborating laboratories in the United States are 
requested to submit a subset of influenza-positive respiratory 
specimens to CDC for further virus characterization. CDC 
characterizes influenza viruses through one or more laboratory 
tests, including genomic sequencing, antigenic characterization

* The CDC influenza surveillance system collects five categories of information 
from eight data sources: 1) viral surveillance (U.S. World Health Organization 
collaborating laboratories, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus 
Surveillance System, and novel influenza A virus case reporting); 2) outpatient 
illness surveillance (U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance 
Network); 3) mortality (the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality 
Surveillance System and influenza-associated pediatric mortality reports); 
 
4) hospitalizations (FluSurv-NET, which includes the Emerging Infections 
Program and surveillance in three additional states); and 5) summary of the

¶ Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when 
isolated from swine, but are called variant influenza viruses when isolated from 
humans. Seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in the human 
population have important antigenic and genetic differences from influenza 
viruses circulating in swine.

by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and neutralization assays. 
Historically HI data have been used most commonly to assess 
the similarity between vaccine viruses and circulating viruses 
to infer how well the vaccine might work until such time as 
vaccine effectiveness estimates are available.** For all viruses 
characterized at CDC laboratories, next-generation sequencing 
is performed to determine the genetic identity of circulating 
viruses. For those viruses whose antigens cannot be character-
ized, their antigenic properties are inferred from viruses with 
matching genes whose antigen profile is known.
CDC has genetically characterized 293 viruses (31 influenza A 
(H1N1)pdm09; 215 influenza A (H3N2); and 47 influenza B 
viruses) collected since October 1, 2016. The hemagglutinin (HA) 
gene segment of all influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses analyzed 
belonged to genetic group 6B.1. Influenza A (H3N2) virus HA 
gene segments analyzed belonged to genetic groups 3C.2a or 
3C.3a. Genetic group 3C.2a includes a newly emerging subgroup 
known as 3C.2a1. The HA of influenza B/Victoria-lineage viruses 
all belonged to genetic group V1A. The HA of all influenza B/
Yamagata-lineage viruses analyzed belonged to genetic group Y3.
Eighty-nine influenza viruses (26 influenza A (H1N1)
pdm09; 42 influenza A (H3N2); and 21 influenza B viruses) 
collected since October 1, 2016 have been antigenically 
characterized. All 26 (100%) influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 
viruses were antigenically similar to A/California/7/2009, 
the reference virus representing the influenza A (H1N1) 
component of the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere vaccine. 
Thirty-nine of 42 (92.9%)  influenza A (H3N2) viruses were 
antigenically similar to the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014–like 
cell propagated reference viruses belonging to genetic group 
3C.2a and representing the influenza A (H3N2) component 
of the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere vaccine. Six of seven 
(85.7%) influenza B/Victoria-lineage viruses were anti-
genically similar to B/Brisbane/60/2008, the reference virus 
representing the influenza B component of the 2016–17 
Northern Hemisphere trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines. 
All 14 (100%) influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were 
antigenically similar to B/Phuket/3073/2013, the reference 
virus representing the influenza B component of the 2016–17 
Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent vaccine.
Antiviral Resistance of Influenza Viruses
The WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and Control of Influenza at CDC tested 205 influenza virus 
specimens (35 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, 123 influenza A 
(H3N2), and 47 influenza B viruses) collected since October 1, 
2016, in the United States for resistance to the influenza neur-
aminidase inhibitor antiviral medications oseltamivir, zanamivir, 
and peramivir, drugs currently approved for use against seasonal 
influenza. All 205 influenza viruses tested were found to be 
sensitive to all three antiviral medications. An additional 31 
influenza A (H3N2) viruses were tested for resistance to oselta-
mivir and zanamivir, and they were found to be sensitive to both 
antiviral medications.
Outpatient Illness Surveillance
During October 2–December 17, 2016, the weekly percentage 
of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI)†† reported by 
approximately 2,000 U.S. Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network 
(ILINet) providers in 50 states, New York City, Chicago, the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, ranged 
from 1.2% to 2.3.%. The week ending December 17 was the 
first week of the 2016–17 season during which the percentage of 
outpatient visits for ILI was above the national baseline§§ (weekly 
percentage of visits for ILI was 2.3%, national baseline is 2.2%) 
(Figure 3). During the 1997–98 through 2015–16 influenza sea-
sons, excluding the 2009 pandemic, the peak weekly percentages 
of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 2.4% to 7.7%. For the 
week ending December 17, on a regional level, the percentage of 
outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 1.1% to 3.5%. Five regions 
(regions 2, 4, 8, 9, and 10) reported a proportion of outpatient visits 
for ILI at or above their region-specific baseline levels. Data collected 
from ILINet also are used to produce a measure of ILI activity¶¶ 
by jurisdiction. For the week ending December 17, Oklahoma 
and Puerto Rico experienced high ILI activity; New York City and 
two states (Arizona and Georgia) experienced moderate ILI activ-
ity; 10 states (Alabama, Colorado, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia) 
experienced low ILI activity. The remaining 37 states experienced 
 
** A virus is considered “reference virus-like” if its hemagglutination inhibition 
(HI) or neutralization focus reduction (FRA) titer is within fourfold of the 
homologous HI/FRA titer of the reference strain. A virus is considered as 
low to the reference virus if there is an eightfold or greater reduction in the 
HI or FRA titer when compared with the homologous HI or FRA titer of 
the reference strain.
 
†† Defined as a fever (temperature ≥100°F [≥37.8°C]), oral or equivalent, and 
cough and/or sore throat, without a known cause other than influenza.
 
§§ The national and regional baselines are the mean percentage of visits for 
influenza-like illness (ILI) during noninfluenza weeks for the previous three 
seasons plus two standard deviations. Noninfluenza weeks are defined as 
periods of ≥2 consecutive weeks in which each week accounted for <2% of 
the season’s total number of specimens that tested positive for influenza. 
National and regional percentages of patient visits for ILI are weighted on 
the basis of state population. Use of the national baseline for regional data 
is not appropriate.
 
¶¶ Activity levels are based on the percentage of outpatient visits in a jurisdiction 
attributed to ILI and are compared with the average percentage of ILI visits 
that occur during weeks with little or no influenza virus circulation. Activity 
levels range from minimal, corresponding to ILI activity from outpatient 
clinics at or below the average, to high, corresponding to ILI activity from 
outpatient clinics much higher than the average. Because the clinical definition 
of ILI is nonspecific, not all ILI is caused by influenza; however, when 
combined with laboratory data, the information on ILI activity provides a 
clearer picture of influenza activity in the United States.

minimal ILI activity, and the District of Columbia had insufficient 
data to calculate an ILI activity level.
Geographic Spread of Influenza Activity
Influenza activity levels reported by state and territorial epide-
miologists indicate the geographic spread of influenza viruses. For 
the week ending December 17 (week 50), Puerto Rico reported 
widespread activity.*** Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 13 states 
(Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, 
New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, 
South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington) reported regional 
activity. The District of Columbia and 26 states (Arizona, Arkansas, 
Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North 
Dakota, Ohio, T
ennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming) reported 
local activity, and 11 states (California, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, 
Montana, New Mexico, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, 
West Virginia, and Wisconsin) reported sporadic activity.
Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations
CDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-
confirmed influenza infection in adults and children through 
the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-
NET),††† which covers approximately 27 million persons (9% 
of the U.S. population). During October 1–December 17, 
2016, 676 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospital-
izations were reported, yielding an overall hospitalization rate 
of 2.4 per 100,000 population. Persons aged ≥65 years had 
the highest rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated 
hospitalization and accounted for approximately 53.1% of 
reported influenza-associated hospitalizations.
Pneumonia and Influenza-Attributed Mortality
CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza (P&I)–attributed 
deaths through the National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS) Mortality Reporting System. The percentages of 
deaths attributed to P&I are released 2 weeks after the week 
of death to allow for collection of sufficient data to produce a 
stable P&I mortality percentage. Based on data from NCHS 
available December 23, 2016, 5.9% (1,763 of 29,760) of all 
U.S. deaths occurring during the week ending December 3, 
2016 (week 48) were attributed to P&I. This percentage is 
below the epidemic threshold§§§ of 6.9% for week 48. Since 
October 2, the weekly percentage of deaths attributed to P&I 
has ranged from 5.4% to 5.9% and has not exceeded the epi-
demic threshold this season. P&I percentages for recent weeks 
might be artificially low because of a backlog of records requir-
ing manual processing, and the percentage of deaths caused by 
P&I is higher among manually coded death certificates than 
among machine-coded death certificates. The percentages of 
death caused by P&I will likely increase as more data become 
available. During the previous five influenza seasons, the peak 
weekly percentage of deaths attributable to P&I ranged from 
8.2% in the 2015–16 season to 11.1% in the 2012–13 season.
Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality
As of December 17, 2016 (week 50), no influenza-associated 
pediatric deaths occurring during the 2016–17 season were 
reported to CDC. During the previous three influenza seasons, 
the number of influenza-associated pediatric deaths ranged 
from 89 in the 2015–16 season to 148 in the 2014–15 season.
Discussion
Influenza activity in the United States was low in October 
2016, and has been slowly increasing since November, 2016. 
Peak influenza activity in the United States most commonly 
occurs during December–March, but substantial influenza 
activity can occur as early as November, and activity can last 
 *** Levels of activity are 1) no activity; 2) sporadic: isolated laboratory-confirmed 
influenza cases or a laboratory-confirmed outbreak in one institution, with no 
increase in activity; 3) local: increased ILI, or two or more institutional outbreaks 
(ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in one region of the state, with recent 
laboratory evidence of influenza in that region; virus activity no greater than 
sporadic in other regions; 4) regional: increased ILI activity or institutional 
outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in two or more outbreaks, 
but less than half of the regions in the state with recent laboratory evidence of 
influenza in those regions; and 5) widespread: increased ILI activity or 
institutional outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in at least half 
the regions in the state, with recent laboratory evidence of influenza in the state.
 ††† FluSurv-NET conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed, 
influenza-associated hospitalizations in children and adolescents aged <18 years 
(since the 2003–04 influenza season) and adults aged ≥18 years (since the 2005–06 
influenza season). The FluSurv-NET covers approximately 70 counties in the 10 
Emerging Infections Program states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, 
Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee) and 
additional Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states. IHSP 
began during the 2009–10 season to enhance surveillance during the 2009 H1N1 
pandemic. IHSP sites included Iowa, Idaho, Michigan, Oklahoma, and South 
Dakota during the 2009–10 season; Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode 
Island, and Utah during the 2010–11 season; Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, and 
Utah during the 2011–12 season; Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Utah 
during the 2012–13 season; and Michigan, Ohio, and Utah during the 2013–14, 
2014–15, 2015–16, and 2016–17 seasons. Cumulative unadjusted incidence rates 
are calculated using CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics population 
estimates for the counties included in the surveillance catchment area. Laboratory 
confirmation is dependent on clinician-ordered influenza testing, and testing for 
influenza often is underutilized because of the poor reliability of rapid test results 
and greater reliance on clinical diagnosis for influenza. Therefore, cases identified 
as part of influenza hospitalization surveillance likely are an underestimation of the 
actual number of persons hospitalized with influenza.
 
§§§ The seasonal baseline proportion of pneumonia and influenza (P&I) deaths 
is projected using a robust regression procedure, in which a periodic regression 
model is applied to the observed percentage of deaths from P&I that were 
reported by the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance 
System during the preceding 5 years. The epidemic threshold is set at 1.645 
standard deviations above the seasonal baseline.

until May. During the 2013–14 and 2014–15 influenza 
seasons, activity began relatively early and peaked in 
late December and early January; however, during the 
2015–16 season, activity did not begin to increase until 
early January and peaked in mid-March. While it is not 
possible to predict when influenza activity will peak for 
the current season, influenza activity will likely increase 
in the coming weeks.
During October 2–December 17, 2016, influenza A 
(H3N2) viruses were identified more frequently in the 
United States than other influenza viruses, but influenza A 
(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses were also reported. 
Influenza A (H3N2) virus–predominant seasons are typi-
cally more severe overall than influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 
virus–predominant seasons, and are especially severe 
among the elderly and the very young (1). The major-
ity of the influenza viruses collected in the United States 
since October 1, 2016, were characterized antigenically or 
genetically as being similar to the reference viruses repre-
senting vaccine components recommended for the 2016–17 
Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines.
Annual influenza vaccination is the most effective method 
of preventing influenza and its complications. In the United 
States, during the 2010–11 through 2015–16 influenza sea-
sons, influenza vaccination prevented an estimated 1.6 million 
to 6.7 million cases and 39,301–86,730 hospitalizations each 
season (2). Twice a year, WHO convenes a meeting to review 
available surveillance, laboratory, and clinical data and makes 
recommendations for the composition of influenza vaccines. 
These meetings take place in February and September for 
selection of vaccine strains for Northern Hemisphere and 
Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines, respectively. In 
February 2016, WHO recommended that the 2016–17 tri-
valent influenza vaccines used in the Northern Hemisphere 
contain an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, 
an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus, and a 
B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (B/Victoria lineage), and 
that quadrivalent vaccines contain the viruses recommended 
for the trivalent vaccines, as well as a B/Phuket/3073/2013-
like virus (B/Yamagata lineage) (3). In September 2016, 
WHO recommended that the 2017 Southern Hemisphere 
influenza vaccine strains remain the same as the 2016–17 
Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine strains with the 
exception of the A (H1N1)pdm09-like virus. The A (H1N1)
pdm09-like virus recommended for the 2017 Southern 
Hemisphere vaccine is an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)
pdm09-like virus. This change represents the first update 
of the A(H1N1) vaccine strain since the 2009 pandemic. 
Although almost all recent A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were 
antigenically indistinguishable from A/California/07/2009 
using ferret antisera, some human postvaccination sera

showed reduced titers against recently circulating A (H1N1)
pdm09 viruses belonging to the 6B.1 and 6B.2 genetic 
groups (3,4).
As of early November, 2016, approximately 60% of the 
U.S. population had not been vaccinated against influenza 
for the 2016–17 season (5).Overall influenza vaccination 
coverage during the 2015–16 season was 45.6%. This 
represents a 1.5 percentage point decrease compared with 
the 2014–15 season, a decline driven by decreased vaccine 
uptake among persons aged 50–64 years and ≥65 years (6). 
Because the peak month for influenza activity typically 
ranges from December to March, and influenza activity for 
the current season is just beginning to increase, receiving 
influenza vaccine at this time still offers substantial public 
health benefits. Health care providers should recommend 
influenza vaccine now and throughout the influenza season 
to all unvaccinated persons aged ≥6 months who do not 
have contraindications. Children aged 6 months–8 years 
who have not previously received a total of ≥2 doses of any 
trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine (doses do not 
have to be received in the same influenza season) before 
July 1, 2016, require 2 doses for the 2016–17 season. The 
interval between the 2 doses should be at least 4 weeks (7).
Although influenza vaccination is the best way to reduce 
the impact of influenza, antiviral medications continue to be 
an important adjunct to vaccination for reducing the health 
impact of influenza. Available effective antiviral medications 
include oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. All influenza 
viruses collected since October 1, and tested for antiviral 
resistance, were found to be susceptible to these antiviral 
medications. Treatment as soon as possible with influenza 
antivirals is recommended for patients with confirmed or sus-
pected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive 
illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity 
year-round in the United States. The influenza season generally 
begins in the fall and continues through the winter and spring 
months; however, the timing and severity of circulating 
influenza viruses can vary by geographic location and season.
What is added by this report?
During October 2–December 17, 2016, influenza activity 
remained low in October but has been slowly increasing since 
November in the United States. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses were 
the most frequently identified viruses. Almost all viruses 
characterized thus far this season have been similar to the 
components of the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere trivalent and 
quadrivalent influenza vaccine formulations. All influenza 
viruses tested to date have been sensitive to the antiviral drugs 
oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Vaccination is the primary method to prevent influenza illness 
and its complications. Health care providers should continue to 
recommend influenza vaccination to all unvaccinated persons 
aged ≥6 months now and throughout the influenza season. As 
an adjunct to vaccine, treatment with influenza antiviral 
medications is recommended for patients with confirmed or 
suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progres-
sive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk 
for influenza-related complications. Antivirals can lessen 
severity and duration of illness and can reduce severe outcomes 
of influenza. Antiviral medications work best when adminis-
tered early in the course of influenza illness.
