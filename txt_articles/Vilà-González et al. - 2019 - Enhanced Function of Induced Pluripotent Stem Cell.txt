ABSTRACT
The mortality rate for (cardio)-vascular disease is one of the highest in the world, so a healthy
functional endothelium is of outmost importance against vascular disease. In this study, human
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were reprogrammed from 1 ml blood of healthy donors and
subsequently differentiated into endothelial cells (iPS-ECs) with typical EC characteristics. This
research combined iPS cell technologies and next-generation sequencing to acquire an insight
into the transcriptional regulation of iPS-ECs. We identified endothelial cell-specific molecule
1 (ESM1) as one of the highest expressed genes during EC differentiation, playing a key role in
EC enrichment and function by regulating connexin 40 (CX40) and eNOS. Importantly, ESM1
enhanced the iPS-ECs potential to improve angiogenesis and neovascularisation in in vivo models
of angiogenesis and hind limb ischemia. These findings demonstrated for the first time that
enriched functional ECs are derived through cell reprogramming and ESM1 signaling, opening the
horizon for drug screening and cell-based therapies for vascular diseases. Therefore, this study
showcases a new approach for enriching and enhancing the function of induced pluripotent
stem (iPS) cell-derived ECs from a very small amount of blood through ESM1 signaling, which
greatly enhances their functionality and increases their therapeutic potential. STEM CELLS

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
In regenerative medicine and cell therapy, endothelial cell (EC) reprogramming is a major tool
for understanding key factors in treating vascular disease. Thus, facilitating the function and
maintenance of generated ECs is very important. The current study has revealed, for the first
time, the role of ESM1 signaling in improving the function and neovascularization potential in
ECs generated from induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro and in vivo.
INTRODUCTION
The complications arising from macrovascular
and microvascular disease can be a major
source of mortality in diseases such as diabetes
and cardiovascular disease [1, 2]. As a result,
removing the causative insult is one of the pri-
mary strategies to repair endothelial cells (ECs)
in vivo. However, when this approach is not
adequate another important strategy is vascular
regenerative medicine, which could repair and
regenerate damaged cells including the genera-
tion of functional ECs for transplantation [3].
Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived
endothelial cells (iPS-ECs) have shown notable
therapeutic
potential
in
preclinical
studies,
which includes the ability to incorporate into
and re-endothelialize damaged vasculature [3, 4]
as well as to inhibit neointimal and inflamma-
tory responses to vascular injury [5]. In addition,
they have shown great functional promise in
providing opportunities for disease modeling
[6, 7]. Consequently, iPS cells in regenerative
medicine show great potential today as they
can be used to generate patient-specific cells
and personalized therapies [8].
Even though there are many approaches in
reprogramming methodology [9, 10], many of
the iPS cell generation mechanisms and their
subsequent differentiation toward various cell

 lineages still remain relatively unclear. Moreover, prolonged
culture of iPS-ECs populations can limit their clinical applica-
tion and since they are not derived from intact blood vessels,
they show an immature phenotype [11, 12]. iPS-ECs generation
efficiency has increased over the last years, resulting in nearly
pure populations of endothelial-like cells [13]. However, these
methods still present several limitations such as population
heterogeneity transient endothelial phenotype and differentia-
tion variability between cell lines. Recent studies have, thus,
attempted to improve the aforementioned issues by improving
the protocols for EC generation [14] and refining the acquisi-
tion
of
purer
iPS-ECs
populations
through
fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) [15] or EC progenitors through
magnetic activation cell sorting (MACS) [16, 17]. However,
more effort still needs to be made toward the understanding
of the mechanisms that drive iPS-ECs differentiation in a well-
defined and highly reproducible environment.
In the pursuit to understand the underlying mechanisms of
the EC differentiation process, this research combined iPS cell
technologies and next-generation sequencing to acquire a com-
prehensive insight into the transcriptional regulation of iPS-ECs
differentiation. More specifically, the ultimate goal of this work
was to identify endothelial lineage-enriched genes that have the
potential to eventually increase iPS-ECs enrichment. To achieve
that, human iPS cells were reprogrammed from 1 ml of blood
using
nonintegrating reprogramming
vectors from healthy
donors in 7–10 days based on a fast and highly efficient
approach. Up to six different donors were used to establish iPS
cell lines for this study, which were then differentiated into iPS-
ECs displaying typical EC characteristics. Subsequently, high-
throughput RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of iPS cells, iPS-ECs, and
a subset of primary endothelial cells (human umbilical vein
endothelial cells [HUVECs]) was implemented to undertake com-
parative transcriptome analyses. Out of the many genes, endo-
thelial cell-specific molecule 1 (ESM1) emerged as a primary
candidate due to its known implication in a variety of cell func-
tions such as angiogenesis [18] and EC responses due to stress
factors and disease [19]. As a result, we found that the Endo-
thelial Cell-Specific Molecule 1 (ESM1) holds a key role in
enrichment and improved function of iPS-ECs.

Blood Mononuclear Cells Isolation and Expansion
In this study, iPS cell lines have been generated from at least six
donors. Written informed consent was obtained from each
donor before blood collection. Nonmobilized peripheral blood
(1–20 ml) was collected by venepuncture in EDTA-coated 4 ml
tubes. The blood was gradient-separated by layering it on Histo-
paque solution (1:1 ratio) and spinning for 30 minutes at 550gx
at room temperature (break OFF). The mononuclear cells
(MNCs) formed a buffy coat between the plasma layer and the
Histopaque buffer layer, and were collected using a soft plastic
pipette. After three washes with phosphate buffered solution
(PBS), the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of MNC medium and
plated at a density of 4 million cells/ml. After 7 days of expan-
sion, changing the medium every 3 days, the cells were either
cryopreserved or subjected to iPS cells reprogramming and EC
differentiation (see also Supporting Information Appendix).
RNA Sequencing
Cells were briefly washed with PBS and harvested using QIAzol
lysis buffer. Total mRNA and miRNA was extracted and purified
using miRNAeasy (QIAGEN). The RNA concentration was deter-
mined using NanoDrop spectrophotometer and the integrity of
the sample was assessed using Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit and
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).
RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using a stranded KAPA
RNA-Seq Kit with RiboErase (KapaBiosystems, Wilmington, MA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with 1 μg
total RNA in 10 μl RNase-free water as an input. Libraries were
sequenced on a NextSeq (Illumina) and reads mapped to the
human reference genome (hg38), allowing up to 2 mismatches
and up to 10 hits per read using the CLC Genomics Workbench
10.0.1
(https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com).
Reference
sequences were annotated with genes and transcripts. Refer-
ence content was mapped to gene regions only. Expression
values per gene or transcript were defined by total counts. A
false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value of ≤.05 was chosen
to indicate statistical significance. Comparative gene expression
data was filtered according to the defined fold change and FDR-
adjusted p-value thresholds. Statistical analysis results were dis-
played as volcano plots, where −log10(p-values) are plotted
against log2(fold change) for each feature. Hierarchical clustering
of features (Manhattan distance; single linkage) was used to
identify genes with similar expression patterns over the sam-
ples. K-mean clustering was also performed (number of parti-
tions = 5; distance metric = Manhattan distance). For all RNA
sequencing steps implemented in CLC, default settings were
used, unless stated otherwise. Detailed methods and materials
can be found in Supporting Information Appendix and Experi-
mental Procedures.

 RESULTS
Efficient Generation of Integration-Free iPS Cells from
Peripheral Blood MNCs in 9 Days
MNCs were isolated from healthy donor peripheral blood and
expanded for 7 days before being successfully reprogrammed
into iPS cells (Fig. 1A). MNCs were initially isolated from a
starting amount of 20 ml of blood, followed by a scaling down
procedure to 1 ml of blood. Because the efficiency of MNC
reprogramming is lower than reprogramming from other cell
sources, instead of only using the standard Yamanaka factors
[20], we used the nonintegrating episomal plasmid vectors
pEB-C5 (overexpressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, and Lin28),
and pEB-Tg vector (overexpressing SV40 large T antigen)
[21, 22] to generate iPS cells in a fast and robust manner.
Around day 9, typical iPS cell colonies with well-defined round
limits were observed (Fig. 1B). Established iPS cell colonies
from 1 ml of blood were determined to be pluripotent through
the assessment of extensively characterized pluripotency-
associated markers. iPS cell colonies stained positive for Oct4,
TRA-1-60, Lin28, and CDy1 (Fig. 1B). Additional characterization
using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Fig. 1C) and
immunoblotting (Fig. 1D) confirmed that iPS cells exhibit mark-
edly enhanced expression of pluripotency markers at mRNA
and protein levels. MNCs did not express these markers
(Fig. 1C, 1D). Lastly, teratoma formation is widely accepted as
the gold standard for defining bona-fide iPS cells. Following
subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodefi-
ciency (SCID) mice, iPS cells formed tumoural structures with
components of all three germ cell layers—ectoderm, meso-
derm, and endoderm (Fig. 1E). Taken together, this fast and
robust 9-day protocol successfully reprogrammed donor MNCs
from as little as 1 ml of blood to fully pluripotent iPS cells
using nonintegrating methodology, whose pluripotent charac-
teristics were confirmed on a number of levels.
Differentiation of Human iPS Cells to iPS-ECs
To differentiate iPS cells to iPS-ECs, cells were seeded on
collagen IV-coated plates in EGM-2 media with bone morpho-
genetic protein 4 (BMP4), Activin A, 6-[[2-[[4-(2,4-dichlorophe-
nyl)-5-(5-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]ethyl]
amino]-3-pyridinecarbonitrile
(CHIR99021),
and
fibroblast
growth factor 2 (FGF2). As it was expected, undifferentiated
iPS cells were negative for EC markers such as CD31 prior to
EC differentiation as flow cytometry data showed in Support-
ing Information Figure S1A. After 48 hours, the medium
was supplemented with vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), FGF2, and 4-[3-(2-pyridinyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-quinoline
(LY364947) and was refreshed every other day. On day 6, posi-
tive selection of cells mediated by MACS was performed,
according to the expression of the endothelial-specific cell sur-
face marker CD144, the most specific EC marker, and the cells
were expanded and used for the experiments. From this point
onward, iPS-ECs positive for CD144 were cultured in conditions
that would maintain the endothelial phenotype in the pres-
ence of VEGF and LY364947. The CD144 negative population
was briefly characterized showing positive expression of the
stromal marker CD90 (Supporting Information Fig. S1C). In
essence, this 6-day EC differentiation protocol (Fig. 2A) is both
efficient and effective in generating iPS-EC lines. Following EC
differentiation, the morphological appearance of the cells pro-
gressed away from the three-dimensional organization of iPS
cells to a flatter, more cobblestone-like morphology (Fig. 2B).
In comparison to iPS cells, iPS-ECs displayed upregulation of
the EC markers KDR, CD144, and eNOS at the mRNA level
(Fig. 2C), confirming their progression toward the vascular line-
age. This upregulation was progressive between days 0 and
6 of differentiation (Fig. 2C), while a decline was observed on
day 9 (Supporting Information Fig. S1B). Since there was a
peak of EC marker expression on day 6 of differentiation and
more than 80% of the cells were CD144+ (Fig. 2D), we per-
formed MACS-mediated selection of CD144+ cells on day 6 and
named the positively selected cells as iPS-ECs from this point
on. Additional real-time data also confirmed high levels of EC
markers 3 days after CD144 selection (Fig. 2C). After this point,
the cells were used for experiments and further immunoblot-
ting experiments confirmed that, at the protein level, iPS-ECs
had upregulated CD144 with concomitant downregulation of
Oct4 (Fig. 2E). A key feature of mature ECs is their ability to
form junctions. Such junctions permit adhesion and communi-
cation between ECs and as such, are involved in regulating pro-
cesses including paracellular permeability, cell growth and
angiogenesis [23]. Indeed, immunofluorescent staining of iPS-
ECs confirmed their ability to form adherens and tight junc-
tions, as evidenced by specific staining for CD144, CD31, and
ZO-1 (Fig. 2F). iPS-ECs were positively stained using a low-
density lipoprotein uptake assay, in which cells took up Acety-
lated (Ac)-LDL (Fig. 2F). When seeded onto Matrigel, iPS-ECs
formed capillary-like structures in vitro, which were positively
stained with CD144 (Fig. 2F). Overall, this EC differentiation
protocol provides a robust method to produce populations of
iPS-ECs.
A Genome-Wide Shift Away from Pluripotency
To gain a detailed insight into the molecular changes that
occur following the EC differentiation of iPS cells, RNA-seq was
performed. Gene expression profiles were compared for iPS
cells, iPS-ECs, and HUVECs in at least three independent exper-
iments. HUVECs were chosen as representative primary ECs.
Generated RNA-Seq outputs were analyzed using the CLC
Genomics Workbench 10.0.1 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.
com) to identify differential expression patterns. Count distribu-
tions were visualized using box plots. In line with data quality
assessment, expression values were normalized. To explore simi-
larities and differences between cell lines, hierarchical clustering
of samples was undertaken, which indicated that replicates clus-
tered together, as expected (Fig. 2G). Of note, iPS-ECs clustered
more closely with HUVECs than with iPS cells, confirming that the
transcriptional network pertaining to these stem cell-derived ECs
has undergone a shift in expression profile away from pluripo-
tency and toward a specialized EC population. A scatterplot
depicts the overall gene expression changes between iPS cells
and iPS-ECs (Supporting Information Fig. S2A). To confirm that
iPS-ECs were a committed cellular population, fold change values
for key pluripotency markers were assessed. Their genetic shift
away from pluripotency was evidenced by the significant downre-
gulation of Nanog (−2,731; p = .00), Oct4 (−23,009; p = .00),
Lin28A (−10,073; p = .00), and SOX2 (−71; p = 1.06 × 10−25) in
iPS-ECs versus iPS cells (Supporting Information Fig. S2B). This
confirms that the differentiation protocol implemented here suc-
cessfully generated EC-like cells from iPS cells by overwriting the

 pluripotent profile of the starter cell population. Importantly, iPS-
ECs’ transcriptomes reflect expression patterns that are closer to
that of primary mature ECs.
EC Differentiation Enriches for Key Endothelial
Characteristics and ESM1 Signaling
To obtain a more detailed insight into the endothelial quali-
ties of iPS-ECs, differential expression patterns for EC lineage-
specific markers were assessed. iPS-ECs displayed a unique
gene expression profile that separated them from iPS cells.
When analyzing differential expression, data was filtered to
include only genes that were differentially expressed at a
defined significance level. To remove genes with low fold
change values, a fold change threshold of ≥2 was considered
to indicate differential expression. An FDR-adjusted p-value
of ≤.05 indicated statistical significance. Under these parame-
ters, 3,495 genes were significantly upregulated in iPS-ECs
compared with iPS cells. When compared with iPS cells,
sequencing confirmed that iPS-ECs displayed upregulation of
endothelial markers (Supporting Information Fig. S3A, S3B).
iPS-ECs also demonstrated significant upregulation of EC-
specific signaling (Supporting Information Fig. S3A, S3B).
Interestingly, a number of genes that were upregulated in
iPS-ECs, including PTX3 and GDF5 are known to be related
with angiogenesis [24, 25]. Importantly, the generated iPS-ECs
population appears to be heterogeneous containing both
arterial markers, such as NRP1 and EPHB2, as well as, the
venous marker, NR2F2 (Supporting Information Fig. S3A,
S3B). However, higher expression of arterial markers indicates
a greater tendency toward this subtype. Gene functional clas-
sification was also undertaken to identify groups of related
genes that were enriched in iPS-ECs versus iPS cells. In the
resting state ECs are efficient antigen-presenting cells. Corre-
spondingly, iPS-ECs demonstrated functional enrichment for
various membrane protein-encoding genes (Supporting Infor-
mation Fig. S4). Annotation with GO “Biological Process”
terms (Supporting Information Fig. S5A) confirmed enrich-
ment for characteristic vascular processes including vascular
development (p = 1.45 × 10−6), blood vessel morphogenesis
(p
=
9.08
×
10−6)
and
regulation
of
cell
adhesion
(p = 9.71 × 10−6; Supporting Information Fig. S5A). These
processes identified enriched genes such as ENG, a novel EC
specification gene [26] and FOXF1, a critical transcription fac-
tor that regulates embryonic vasculature development [27].
Enrichment patterns, therefore, correlate with the ability of
iPS-ECs to form vascular structures. Furthermore, annotation
of data with GO “Cellular Component” terms revealed enrich-
ment for genes located in the extracellular region of the cell,
including genes with roles in EC lineage specification and
function (Supporting Information Fig. S5B). Examples included
FGF5, TGF-β1, ANGPT2, and ESM1. Based on these analyses,
iPS-ECs possess transcriptomic profiles that will allow them
to engage in a vast array of endothelial-related functions.
Interestingly, the RNA-Seq analysis has revealed a high
expression level of the gene ESM1 in iPS-ECs compared with
iPS cells, as the Volcano plot shows in Figure 2H. As such,
ESM1 held the potential to be an important candidate impli-
cated in angiogenesis. Therefore, this study has further
focused on the underlying mechanisms and function of ESM1
in iPS-ECs, with the ultimate goal to enrich the function of
the derived iPS-ECs based on a fully defined environment.
ESM1 Regulates EC Marker Expression in iPS-
Derived ECs
To validate the RNA-Seq data and explore whether ESM1 is
implicated in EC enrichment, real-time PCR was performed to
monitor expression levels of ESM1 mRNA in iPS cells, differen-
tiating iPS-ECs at 3, 6, and 9 days of EC differentiation, and
HUVECs. ESM1 mRNA levels significantly increased over time
in iPS-ECs compared with the control iPS cells, reaching a peak
at 9 days of differentiation, the levels of which were compara-
ble to HUVECs (Fig. 3A). Seeing these results, we wanted to
assess the role of ESM1 on iPS-ECs after differentiation and
selection of CD144+ cells. When such iPS-ECs were visualized
using immunofluorescent microscopy, ESM1 costained with EC
markers KDR, CD144, and eNOS, indicating their concurrent
expression (Fig. 3B). ESM1 was cloned in an overexpression
vector-tagged with mCherry (EX-ESM1) which was used to
overexpress ESM1 in iPS-ECs (Fig. 3C). Strikingly, significant
increase in mRNA expression of EC markers KDR, CD144, and
eNOS was observed 48 hours after transfection in mRNA level
(Fig. 3D). In addition, ESM1 secretion levels, as detected by
Luminex assay, were significantly increased in the cell culture
media 48 hours after ESM1 overexpression compared with
controls (Fig. 3E). Seventy-two hours after ESM1 knockdown
by lentiviral transduction, the mRNA levels of ESM1 and EC
markers KDR, CD144, and eNOS were significantly decreased
(Fig. 3F). This was also reflected in the cell culture media, in
which significantly decreased ESM1 secretion levels were
detected by Luminex (Fig. 3G). In addition, immunoblotting
showed decreased protein levels in ESM1 and eNOS 72 hours
after ESM1 knockdown (Fig. 3H), indicating its importance in
regulating EC markers expression. Furthermore, support to the
above notion is provided by additional data which shows that
ESM1 overexpression in iPS-ECs induced the expression of
angiogenic signaling genes such as uPA, Endothelin-1 and
Angiopoietin-2, with a concurrent downregulation of antiangio-
genic factors (Supporting Information Fig. S6). Notably, ESM1
is also induced EC marker expression in early stages of EC dif-
ferentiation (Supporting Information Fig. S7).
ESM1 Regulates CX40 Expression in iPS-ECs
To shed further light into how ESM1 regulates EC markers, gene
expression profiles were compared for iPS-ECs overexpressing
ESM1 (EX-ESM1) and control iPS-ECs overexpressing mCherry
(EX-mCherry). Generated RNA sequencing outputs were ana-
lyzed using the CLC Genomics Workbench 10.0.1 (https://www.
qiagenbioinformatics.com) to identify differential expression
patterns, as described above (Fig. 4A, and Supporting Informa-
tion Fig. S8A, S8B). Interestingly, connexin 40 (CX40) was one of
the highly upregulated genes in the next-generation sequencing

In addition, iPS-ECs when compared with aortic ECs revealed
similar expression levels of the aortic marker Ephrin B2 and the
concurrent expression of ESM1 and CX40 (Supporting Informa-
tion Fig. S9). To confirm the RNA-Seq data, ESM1 was overex-
pressed in iPS-ECs, which resulted in significant increases in
CX40 mRNA levels 48 hours after transfection with the EX-ESM1
plasmid compared with control (EX-mCherry; Fig. 4B). On the
contrary, when ESM1 was knocked down, a significant decrease
in CX40 mRNA expression was observed 72 hours after lentiviral

 transduction with shESM1 compared with nontargeting control
(shNT; Fig. 4C). ESM1 overexpression in iPS-ECs resulted in sig-
nificant increases in protein levels of ESM1, eNOS, CX40, and
nuclear factor-kappa B (NFKB1) 48 hours after transfection with
EX-ESM1 plasmid compared with control (EX-mCherry; Fig. 4D).
When iPS-ECs were visualized using immunofluorescent micros-
copy, ESM1 costained with CX40 indicating their concurrent
expression (Fig. 4E).
ESM1 Regulates EC Marker Expression in iPS-ECs
through CX40
ESM1 has been previously shown to increase the promoter
activity and expression levels of NFKB [28], while putative
transcription factor binding site research in the TRANSFAC
database [29, 30] of the CX40 promoter revealed a binding site
for NFKB. The above facts directed the notion that ESM1
induces the expression of CX40 in our cells possibly through
NFKB induction. As a result, further experiments were per-
formed to investigate how ESM1 regulates the expression of
EC markers. Seventy-two hours after lentiviral knockdown of
CX40 (shCX40), CX40 and the EC markers eNOS and CD144
were significantly reduced at the mRNA level (Fig. 5A). In order
to elucidate further the underlying mechanisms regulated by
ESM1 in iPS-ECs and explore the link with CX40, CX40 was
knocked down using shRNA and ESM1 was overexpressed
24 hours later. Quantitative real-time PCR data (Fig. 5B) and

 Western blots (Fig. 5C) revealed that the induction of EC
markers mediated by ESM1 is ablated by CX40 knockdown,
suggesting that in iPS-ECs ESM1 regulates EC marker expres-
sion through CX40. When the cells were transfected with
ESM1, followed by NFKB inhibitor treatment, EC marker
expression was ablated in the treated cells compared with
controls (Fig. 5D). In addition, Luciferase assay was performed
to assess CX40 promoter activity after ESM1 overexpression
and NFKB inhibition, revealing diminished activity levels com-
pared with controls (Fig. 5E). Immunofluorescent confocal
imaging confirmed the parallel expression of CX40 and eNOS
(Fig. 5F and (Supporting Information Fig. S10A), whereas coim-
munoprecipitation (Co-IP) in cells stably expressing eNOS-GFP,
confirmed the CX40 and eNOS-GFP interaction in (Fig. 5G). This
data is in agreement with previous reports showing a role of
CX40 in ECs in association with the EC marker eNOS [31, 32].

 Therefore, these experiments demonstrate that ESM1 regu-
lates the expression of EC markers such as eNOS and CD144
through an association with CX40, an important EC gap junc-
tion channel component, possibly due to increased formation
and stability of gap junctions, which are essential functional EC
characteristics.
ESM1 Induces Angiogenesis In Vivo
The next step was to validate the pivotal role of ESM1 in iPS-
ECs enrichment and function in vivo. Human iPS-ECs were trans-
fected with either EX-mCherry plasmid or EX-ESM1 plasmid.
After 48 hours, 1 million iPS-ECs overexpressing mCherry control
(EX-mCherry) or 1 million iPS-ECs overexpressing ESM1 (EX-
ESM1) were injected subcutaneously in SCID mice. Hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining of the Matrigel plugs with EX-mCherry
and EX-ESM1 revealed that EX-ESM1 tissues formed defined
vascular structures 7 days after the injection, in comparison to
the control tissues where fewer vascular structures were
observed (Fig. 6A, 6B). In addition, CD144 immunofluorescent
staining of paraffin-embedded tissue sections confirmed the
presence of differentiated cells in the in vivo vascular tubes
(Fig. 6C). The EX-ESM1 tissues showed increased staining for
CD144 and mCherry when compared with EX-mCherry control
tissues (Fig. 6D).
ESM1 Significantly Improved Neovascularization and
Blood Flow Recovery in the Hindlimb Ischemic Model
To supplement the findings from our in vitro and in vivo angio-
genesis data and to confirm further in vivo relevance of EC
enrichment function through ESM1 signaling, additional experi-
ments were performed to investigate whether ESM1 could
induce angiogenesis in ischemic tissues and improve blood
flow (BF) recovery. iPS-ECs (1 × 106) overexpressing control
mCherry (EX-mCherry) or iPS-ECs overexpressing ESM1 (EX-
ESM1) were injected intramuscularly into adductors of an
ischemic model of SCID mice after induction of hindlimb ische-
mia in SCID mice, as we have previously reported [33]. Laser
Doppler images of BF in the lower limbs of mice in prone posi-
tion 14 days postinjection of iPS-ECS showed that the cells
enhanced
neovascularization
and
supported
significantly
higher BF recovery in the ischemic limbs compared with the
PBS controls. Notably, EX-ESM1-injected mice showed even
higher recovery than mice injected with EX-mCherry cells
(Fig. 7A, 7B). Furthermore, limbs receiving EX-ESM1 cells
displayed

 musculature in comparison to their corresponding controls, as
shown by positive staining of adductor muscle sections with
CD144 (Fig. 7C) in immunopositive vessel profiles. Particularly,
engrafted EX-ESM1 cells displayed a typical and well-defined
vascular architecture (Fig. 7C, right panel). Finally, when adduc-
tor muscle sections from EX-mCherry or EX-ESM1 injected
animals were stained and quantified for mCherry and CD144,
EX-ESM1 cells was found to exhibit an improved engraftment
ability compared with controls (Fig. 7D, 7E), suggesting that
EX-ESM1 cells display improved characteristic endothelial
functions in vivo. Altogether, our findings suggest that ESM1
overexpression induces vessel formation in vivo, further sup-
porting its vital role in the enrichment of iPS-ECs and improving
their function, which can, in turn, enhance vascular network
development.

 esteemed regenerative approach toward improving vascular
function in patients with ischemic disease. This current study
has revealed, for the first time, the role of ESM1 in enriching
human iPS-ECs and enhancing their neovascularization poten-
tial both in vitro and in vivo, advancing our understanding sur-
rounding their reprogramming and differentiation.
ESM1 protein, also known as endocan, is a dermatan sulfate
proteoglycan [34] which is primarily expressed in ECs of vascular
tissues including capillaries and arterioles but can also be found
in the ECs of other tissues such as human lung and kidney [35].
Its gene expression is regulated by cytokines, indicating its possi-
ble implication in endothelium-based disorders [36]. In addition,
in recent studies, ESM1 has been identified as a specific bio-
marker of tip cells during angiogenesis [37] as well as a simulta-
neous target and modulator of VEGF signaling in ECs [38].
This study established an optimized protocol for the genera-
tion of iPS-ECs from 1 ml of peripheral blood and used RNA-Seq
to acquire a fresh insight into the mechanisms that underlie the
process of differentiation to ECs and the maintenance of the
endothelial profile. It was hypothesized that this approach
would allow the identification of novel specific genes and path-
ways that are key for the generation of high quality mature ECs.
More specifically, gene expression profiles were compared for
iPS cells, iPS-ECs and HUVECs; iPS-ECs clustered more closely
with HUVECs compared with iPS cells, confirming a dramatic
shift away from pluripotency toward a specialized EC popula-
tion. In addition, this generated EC population expressed both
arterial and venous markers, with a greater propensity for the
former subtype, as evidenced by the presence of Ephrin B2. This
would allow for translational application in arterial vessels, as
well as functional enrichment for various protein-encoding
genes involved in vascular processes, development and blood
vessel morphogenesis and EC lineage specification. Notably,
using this model of iPS differentiation toward ECs, constitutive
ESM1 expression was shown to be markedly upregulated during
differentiation toward iPS-ECs suggesting a possible crucial role
in enhancing this process. Indeed, subsequent in vitro experi-
ments using overexpression or knockdown of ESM1 confirmed
its role in regulating key EC markers in iPS-ECs.
A common limitation of iPS-ECs is their restricted prolifera-
tive capacity, which is also often accompanied by augmented
instability and senescence [39], creating a large barrier in the
path toward their clinical application in treating vascular dis-
ease. It is, thus, imperative that we expand our understanding
and, thus, identify more key factors that may facilitate faster
and safer EC generation. In addition, differentiated ECs can
shift their phenotype away from the endothelial lineage after
prolonged cell culture and exhibit an immature phenotype
[12, 40] with previous efforts focusing on preservation of EC
stability and commitment [41, 42]. Such observations of EC
instability were also made in our study, in which ESM1 levels
were reduced with increasing passages (after 15 passages;
Supporting Information Fig. S10B). As a result, we demon-
strated that ESM1 enhanced EC characteristics in iPS-ECs.
Notably, iPS-ECs overexpressing ESM1 displayed greater func-
tional properties in vitro and in vivo.
While
investigating
the
mechanism
by
which
ESM1
improved EC marker expression, it was noted that CX40 was
significantly increased upon ESM1 overexpression. CX40 is a
major connexin in most vascular ECs [43], a central component
of gap junctions and important in communication [44] and har-
monization of tissue responses [45–47].
In our study, further investigation on the relationship
between ESM1 and CX40 revealed that CX40 acts downstream
of ESM1. Particularly, we saw increased CX40 and amplified EC
marker expression after ESM1 overexpression, which did not
occur when we knocked down CX40. In agreement with our
results, which showed increased EC marker expression and par-
allel expression of CX40 with eNOS, interaction of CX40 with
eNOS has been shown to be important in the regulation of
eNOS expression [31]. Indeed, CX40 is central in endothelial
intercellular communication and EC homeostasis as it interacts
with eNOS and has been shown to be expressed in close prox-
imity to eNOS at cellular interfaces in ECs [48]. It has also been
shown that ESM1 overexpression induces cell proliferation
through induction of the NFKB pathway and that ESM1 interacts
with NFKB and activates the NFKB promoter [28]. Notably, tran-
scriptional binding analysis of the CX40 promoter identified a
binding site for NFKB, suggesting that ESM1 induces the expres-
sion of CX40 in iPS-ECs, possibly through NFKB. In addition
to the in vitro data, iPS-ECs overexpressing ESM1 induced
enhanced angiogenesis in vivo 7 days after subcutaneous injec-
tion in SCID mice and ESM1 overexpression in iPS-ECs signifi-
cantly improved neovascularization and BF recovery in the
hindlimb ischemic model 14 days after intramuscular injection,
demonstrating a crucial role of ESM1 in enhancing angiogenesis
and neovascularization.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our data noticeably demonstrate that iPS cell
generation and further iPS-ECs differentiation can be easily
achieved using nonintegrating methodology from a small
amount of blood, whilst also revealing a vital role for ESM1 in
improving EC enrichment and function. More particularly,
ESM1 enhances CX40 expression improving, in turn, the
expression of EC markers such as eNOS in iPS-ECs. The sche-
matic diagram of the proposed mechanism is shown in the
Graphical Abstract. This new approach for enhancing EC func-
tion of iPS-ECs derived from a very small amount of blood
through cell reprogramming and ESM1 signaling could conse-
quently improve our understanding of the molecular mecha-
nisms involved in the process, and greatly increase the
functionality and therapeutic potential of iPS-ECs in the clinic.
This can, in turn, prove tremendously important in the
advancement of patient-specific therapy, especially in regard
to the treatment of EC dysfunction-based vascular disease.
