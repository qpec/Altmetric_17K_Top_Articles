ariants in ETV6, which encodes a transcription repressor of the E26
transformation-specific family, have recently been reported to be
responsible for inherited thrombocytopenia and hematologic
malignancy. We sequenced the DNA from cases with unexplained domi-
nant thrombocytopenia and identified six likely pathogenic variants in
ETV6, of which five are novel. We observed low repressive activity of all
tested ETV6 variants, and variants located in the E26 transformation-spe-
cific binding domain (encoding p.A377T, p.Y401N) led to reduced binding
to corepressors. We also observed a large expansion of megakaryocyte
colony-forming units derived from variant carriers and reduced pro-
platelet formation with abnormal cytoskeletal organization. The defect in
proplatelet formation was also observed in control CD34+ cell-derived
megakaryocytes transduced with lentiviral particles encoding mutant
ETV6. Reduced expression levels of key regulators of the actin cytoskele-
ton CDC42 and RHOA were measured. Moreover, changes in the actin
structures are typically accompanied by a rounder platelet shape with a
highly heterogeneous size, decreased platelet arachidonic response, and
spreading and retarded clot retraction in ETV6 deficient platelets. Elevated
numbers of circulating CD34+ cells were found in p.P214L and p.Y401N
carriers, and two patients from different families suffered from refractory
anemia with excess blasts, while one patient from a third family was suc-
cessfully treated for acute myeloid leukemia. Overall, our study provides
novel insights into the role of ETV6 as a driver of cytoskeletal regulatory
gene expression during platelet production, and the impact of variants
resulting in platelets with altered size, shape and function and potentially
also in changes in circulating progenitor levels.
Germline variants in ETV6 underlie reduced
platelet formation, platelet dysfunction and
increased levels of circulating CD34+
progenitors

 Introduction
The genetic determinants of non syndromic autosomal
dominant (AD) thrombocytopenia with normal platelet
size remain largely unknown, yet it is important to identify
such variants because they may predispose carriers to
hematological malignancy. Germline variants in RUNX1
cause a familial platelet disorder with an increased risk of
acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML), while variants in the
5′ untranslated region (UTR) of ANKRD26 have also been
shown to predispose individuals to hematologic malignan-
cies. Recently, germline variants in ETV6 (TEL) have been
reported to underlie AD thrombocytopenia with predispo-
sition to leukemia.1-3 ETV6, which was initially identified as
encoding a tumor suppressor in humans, is often found
fused with partner genes in samples from human leukemia
of myeloid and lymphoid origin.4 Somatic ETV6 variants
have also been found in solid tumors, T-cell leukemias and
myelodysplastic syndromes, hence the widespread interest
in this gene.5,6 ETV6 encodes an E26 transformation-specific
(Ets) family transcriptional repressor. It can bind DNA via a
highly conserved Ets DNA-binding consensus site located
at the C-terminus. The N-terminal domain (pointed
domain) is necessary for homotypic dimerization and inter-
action with the Ets family protein FLI.7,8 The central region
is involved in repressive complex recruitment (including
SMRT, Sin3A and NCOR)9 and autoinhibitory activity.10
ETV6 plays an important role in hematopoiesis. In mice,
ETV6 is essential for hematopoietic transition from the
fetal liver to the bone marrow (BM).11 Conditional disrup-
tion of the ETV6 gene has shown that ETV6 plays a
unique, non redundant role in megakaryocytopoiesis.
Data concerning ETV6 involvement in megakaryocy-
topoiesis in humans remains scarce, however, a recent
study has shown that patients expressing a mutated form
of ETV6 displayed abnormal megakaryocyte (MK) devel-
opment with a likely impact on platelet production.1
We have assessed the biological impact of six likely
pathogenic variants in ETV6, of which five are novel. We
describe in detail how variants in ETV6 lead to increased
megakaryocyte  proliferation and various cytoskeleton-
related platelet defects that include altered platelet shape,
reduced Rho GTPase expression in platelets, decreased
proplatelet (PPT) formation and reduced platelet spread-
ing. Additionally, we show that patients exhibit elevated
levels of circulating CD34+ progenitors and a predisposi-
tion to myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia.
Methods 
Platelets and circulating CD34+-cells analysis
Blood samples were collected after informed written consent, in
accordance with our local Institutional Review Boards and the
Declaration of Helsinki. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), washed
platelets and circulating CD34+ cells were prepared according to
standard procedures. For electron microscopy (EM), platelets were
fixed in glutaraldehyde and processed as previously described.12
For platelet spreading, fibronectin-adherent platelets were stained
with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (filamentous (F)-actin) and Alexa
Fluor 594 DNAse I (globular (G)-actin). Filopodia and lamellipodia
were manually quantified. For clot retraction, coagulation of PRP
was triggered using thrombin, and clots were allowed to retract.
Images were recorded using a CoolSNAP CCD camera and ana-
lyzed to evaluate the reduction of the initial clot surface (ImageJ).
The platelet survival assay was based on the method of Thakur
and colleagues.13 
High-throughput and Sanger sequencing 
DNA samples from 957 patients enrolled in the BRIDGE-BPD
project were subjected to whole-genome or whole-exome
sequencing, and the results were used for variant calling as
described previously.14,15 DNA samples from eight patients in the
French cohort were subjected to whole-exome sequencing or
Sanger sequencing at the ETV6 lotus. Sequence analysis was car-
ried out using Chromas X software, and aligned using Multalin.16
Site-directed mutagenesis and luciferase assays
ETV6 cDNA was ligated into a pcDNA3 expression vector, and
mutagenesis was performed using the GENEART® Site-directed
Mutagenesis System kit (Life technologies).17 Transcriptional regu-
latory properties of wild-type (WT) and mutant ETV6 (mutETV6)
as well as ETV6 corepressor binding,18 were determined by using
the luciferase reporter systems in transfected GripTite™ 293
macrophage scavenger receptor (MSR) cells. 
Immunoassays 
Immunoblots were performed with antibodies directed against
human ETV6; SMRT, RHOA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
CDC42, RAC1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (Millipore) and MYH10 (Cell Signaling Technology)
antibodies. Chemiluminescence signals were detected and quanti-
fied (CCD camera-based ImageQuant LAS 4000, GE Healthcare).
Levels of thrombopoietin (TPO) and stromal cell-derived factor 1α
(SDF1α) were quantified via ELISA (Abcam). For the co-immuno-
precipitation assays, whole cell extracts were prepared in NP-40
buffer and pre-cleared with protein A/G magnetic beads
(Millipore). Immunoprecipitation of the cell extracts with anti-
ETV6-coated beads was carried out overnight.
Megakaryocyte  differentiation and quantification of
proplatelet-bearing megakaryocytes
CD34+ cells were grown in serum-free medium supplemented
with TPO and stem cell factor (SCF) (Life Technologies).19 At cul-
ture day 10, we assessed ploidy in the Hoechst+CD41+CD42a+ cell
population20 (Navios, BD Biosciences). Proplatelets were quanti-
fied between day 11 and 15. Microtubule and F-actin organization
was determined in megakaryocytes adhering to fibrinogen with
fluorescently labeled polyclonal rabbit anti-tubulin antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich) and phalloidin (Life Technologies). 
Lentiviral particle production and CD34+ cell 
transduction
Lentiviral particles were prepared as previously described.21,22
CD34+ cells were infected twice. After 8 hours, the cells were
washed and cultured in serum-free medium.
Clonogenic progenitor assays
CD34+ cells were plated in human methylcellulose medium
H4434 (STEMCELL Technologies), supplemented with erythropoi-
etin (EPO), interleukin-3 (IL-3), SCF
, granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TPO to quantify erythroid
(burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), colony-forming unit-ery-
throid (CFU-E), granulocytic/macrophage (CFU-GM), mixed (CFU-
GEMM) and megakaryocyte (CFU-MK)) progenitors at day 12.23
Statistical analyses 
Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software.
Statistical significance was determined via a two-tailed Mann-
Whitney test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

 Results
Identification of affected families
Screening of patients with thrombocytopenia for rare
non-synonymous variants in ETV6 revealed six families
with patients carrying one of six possibly pathogenic vari-
ants. The variants encode p.P214L, which has been previ-
ously reported,3 and the novel substitutions p.I358M,
p.A377T, p.R396G, p.Y401N and p.Y401H (Figure 1A).
Family studies by Sanger sequencing showed segregation
between the ETV6 variant and thrombocytopenia in all
cases for which DNA samples were available (Figure 1B).
Henceforth, we refer to the likely pathogenic variants
described above as mutETV6.

 Description of the families
Our study included six families with mutETV6 variants.
The proband of the first family (F1-IV3) was a 7-year-old
girl who was admitted for emergency care due to the sus-
picion of acute leukemia with asthenia, weakness, pale-
ness, severe thrombocytopenia (44 x 109/L) and anemia
(hemoglobin: 50 g/L). BM examination unequivocally dis-
missed a diagnosis of leukemia, and the anemia was
attributed to an iron deficiency subsequent to repeated
episodes of severe epistaxis. The patient underwent a red
blood cell transfusion, and the anemia was progressively
corrected via iron supplementation. However, the platelet
count remained low (50 x 109/L). Clinical examination of
the parents and two siblings did not reveal any particular
bleeding tendency. However, the patient's mother (F1-III3)
had undergone a splenectomy at the age of 17 because of
chronic thrombocytopenia, and she exhibited subnormal
platelet counts (116-210 x 109/L) at the time of examina-
tion. To gain further insight into the possibility of inherit-
ed thrombocytopenia, we screened the extended family
for platelet counts. An AD form of thrombocytopenia was
evidenced (Figure 1B), with normal mean platelet volume
(MPV) compared with a large population of blood donors
(Figure 1C). Of note, fourteen out of twenty-three carriers

 lies had platelet counts between 60 and 125 x 109/L (Table
1). BM from F2-II3 displayed a delay in granulocyte matu-
ration and dyserythropoiesis (data not shown). Peripheral
blood smears revealed platelet anisocytosis (data not
shown), as confirmed by EM (Figure 1E), which further
highlighted the presence of occasional hypogranular
platelets with a poorly organized open canalicular system.
Patient F2-I1 presented with refractory anemia with
excess blasts (RAEB) and required BM transplantation.
The propositus (F4-II1) from pedigree 4 was referred with
AML type M0 at the age of 8 years, and suffered from
epistaxis, ecchymosis and infections. After 2 years of
chemotherapy treatment, the BM showed no blasts and
the peripheral blood counts normalized, except for a per-
sistent low platelet count (Table 1). BM studies showed
the presence of many hypolobulated small megakary-
ocytes (data not shown). Thrombocytopenia was also pres-
ent in his father and two sisters without any bleeding
problems (Table 1). EM investigation of platelets from
affected members F4-I2 and F4-II3 showed the presence of
both larger and smaller platelets that, significantly, were of
round shape rather than of discoid shape (Figure 1E,F;
P<0.0001). These platelets had normal dense and 
α-granules numbers, but some α-granules were elongated
(data not shown). Pedigree 5 was referred for genetic testing
of AD thrombocytopenia in a father with very mild bleed-
ing problems (propositus F5-I2), and his 2 asymptomatic
daughters (Figure 1B). BM investigation in F5-II2 showed
the presence of dysmegakaryopoiesis with almost no
mature megakaryocytes (data not shown). A mother (F6-I1)
and daughter (propositus F6-II1) from pedigree 6 (Figure
1B) were diagnosed with platelet dense storage pool defi-
ciency (SPD), with platelet aggregation defects and abnor-
mal dense granules. Thrombocytopenia was only record-
ed for the daughter, who suffered from severe menorrha-
gia and had an increased bleeding tendency with bruising
and nosebleeds. The mother had a normal platelet count
and did not carry the ETV6 variant. No clinical informa-
tion or DNA was available from the father. Therefore, the
ETV6 variant in F6-II1 could be present as a de novo or
somatic variant. SPD in the mother and daughter was like-
ly to be caused by another additional genetic factor.
Indeed, in contrast to the obvious platelet aggregation and
secretion defects for these two patients, such abnormali-
ties were not present in the other five families, except for
a decreased aggregation response to arachidonic acid as
the only consistent finding in every family (Online
Supplementary Table S1). Consistent with normal dense
granules found by EM (Figure 1E), adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) secretion and mepacrine uptake and release were
normal (Online Supplementary Table S1). Flow cytometry
analysis of key platelet surface receptors (αIIbb3, glyco-
protein (GP) Ibα, GPIa, GPIV, CD63 and CD62P) was also
normal (Online Supplementary Table S2). 
A platelet survival assay was performed on patient F3-
II4 (Online Supplementary Table S3), and revealed decreased
platelet lifespan (4.6 days) without significant splenic or
hepatic sequestration. Notably, this patient had not under-
gone platelet transfusion. Patient F1-III3 underwent a
111In-oxine platelet survival assessment (autologous
transfusion) in 1981 prior to a splenectomy, which
revealed short platelet half-life (24 h vs. 3.5 days in the
control) and hepatic and splenic platelet sequestration,
with predominant sequestration in the liver (data not
shown). Patient F1-III3 was assessed for anti-human leuko-
cyte antigen (HLA) antibodies on several occasions
(National Center of Blood Transfusion, Marseille, France),
but all results were negative (data not shown).  
Variants in ETV6 lead to a functional defect 
in transcriptional activity
Western blot analysis showed that ETV6 protein expres-
sion was not reduced in platelets from the patients, nor in
GripTite™ 293 MSR cells transfected with the ETV6 vari-
ants (Figure 2A,B). To investigate the transcriptional regu-
latory properties of mutETV6 compared with WT ETV6,
we analyzed repressive activity. Cotransfection of the
reporter plasmid along with expression of a plasmid
encoding WT ETV6 resulted in an almost 90% inhibition
of luciferase activity. The substitution of WT ETV6 with
any of the mutETV6 variants led to a significant reduction
in repressive activity (85% to 100%) (Figure 2C). 
To evaluate whether this reduction in repressive activity
perhaps resulted from variations in nuclear corepressor
complex recruitment, we investigated the interaction of
ETV6 with NCOR, SMRT and Sin3A using a mammalian
ETV6 and platelet formation

SMRT and Sin3A, whereas p.A377T and p.Y401N ETV6
did not (Figure 2D). Immunoprecipitation assays showed
that the p.A377T and p.Y401N variants reduced ETV6
binding to SMRT and SMRTe (Figure 2E)
Increased numbers of circulating CD34 positive cells in

F1 carriers (F1-III3, F1-III7, F1-III8, F1-IV1 and F1-IV3)
exhibited a 4- to 6-fold increase in circulating
CD34+/CD38+ cells compared with healthy donors (Figure
3A,B). Similarly, F3-I2 and F3-II4 exhibited a 5- and 3-fold
increase in circulating CD34+ cells compared with controls
(0.16% and 0.09%, respectively, vs. 0.035%). The expres-
sion levels of immature cell markers CD133 and CD117
did not differ between F1 members and controls.

(2068 ± 75 pg/mL; n=9).
Variants in ETV6 cause megakaryocyte hyperplasia but
reduced proplatelet formation in vitro
The percentage of CD41+CD42a+ megakaryocytes
derived from CD34+ (gated on Hoechst+ cells) was signifi-
cantly higher in mutETV6 carriers (Figure 4A,B). No signif-
icant difference in mean ploidy was detected between
patients and healthy donors (Figure 4C). Accordingly, the
number of CD34+-derived CFU-GM/G/M colonies was
higher in patients compared with controls (Figure 4D).

 The number of megakaryocyte progenitors (CFU-MK)
from patients F3-I2 and F3-II4 did not differ from controls,
although the size of CFU-MKs was significantly increased
in the two patients (Figure 4E,F), thereby suggesting an
increased proliferation of megakaryocyte precursors in the
presence of mutETV6.
Proplatelet-bearing megakaryocytes derived from con-
trols showed multiple branched thin extensions, swellings
and tips. In contrast, megakaryocytes from patients
formed very few proplatelets with a reduced number of
thicker extensions. Although there was no swelling, tips
were of increased size (Figure 5A). A 2- to 15-fold decrease
in the percentage of proplatelet-bearing megakaryocytes
was observed in carriers of the p.P214L (F1-III3, F1-III7
and F1-IV3) and p.Y401N (F3-II2 and F3-II4) variants
(Figure 5B). b-tubulin and F-actin staining confirmed the
megakaryocyte-proplatelet extension defect together with
a reduced concentration of both actin filaments and micro-
tubules in the residual larger megakaryocyte cell body
(Figure 5C). Additionally, b-tubulin failed to accumulate
normally in the few extension tips observed in mutETV6
megakaryocytes compared with controls.
To confirm that mutETV6 leads to a defect in proplatelet
formation, CD34+ cells from healthy donors were trans-
duced with lentivirus containing ETV6 sequences encod-
ing the WT or the p.P214L mutant. Non-transduced cells

 were also included as control. After 13 and 15 days of cul-

to non-transduced cells or those transduced with WT

 expression levels in patient platelets. We did not detect
increased MYH10 levels in platelets from ETV6 patients
(F1-III6 and F1-III8), which contrasted with RUNX1 and
FLI1 defects24 (Online Supplementary Figures S1A and S1B).
Proplatelet formation is dependent on massive reorgan-
ization of the actin cytoskeleton. Rho GTPase family
members (e.g., CDC42, RAC1 and RHOA) are key regula-
tors of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in platelets25 and
megakaryocytes. p.P214L (n=5) and p.Y401N (n=2) vari-
ants led to significantly reduced platelet expression levels
of CDC42 and RHOA, without affecting RAC1 expres-
sion (Figure 6A). Likewise, CDC42 and RHOA messenger
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels were decreased in
megakaryocytes from F1 and F3, while RAC1 mRNA lev-
els remained unaffected (Figure 6B). Notably, patient F3-
I2, with 112 x 109 platelets/L, exhibited only slightly
decreased levels of CDC42 and RHOA in platelets (Figure
6C) compared with other affected members. CDC42 and
RHOA levels significantly correlated with platelet count
(n=6 from F1 and F3) (P=0.03 and r=0.84 for CDC42;
P=0.008 and r=0.92 for RHOA). To confirm the specificity
of this effect, we quantified CDC42 protein levels in FLI1
deficient patients with thrombocytopenia (n=2) (122 and
131 x 109/L). None of these patients exhibited reduced lev-
els of CDC42 (Online Supplementary Figure S1C).

 ocytes from patients (F1-III3, F1-III7, F1-III8) did not fully
reverse the phenotype, although it did improve the pro-
platelet-bearing megakaryocyte phenotype. Transduced
cells produced thinner extensions and swellings, which
were not observed in control transduced cells (Figure 6D).
mutETV6 alters platelet spreading
The reduced expression of CDC42 and RHOA suggests
that ETV6 is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, and
thus does not only have an important role in platelet shape
(EM showed more round platelets) and proplatelet forma-
tion, but also in regulating platelet spreading. We assessed
whether the p.P214L transition in ETV6 affects the spread-
ing of platelets over immobilized fibronectin and clot
retraction. Platelets showed a reduced capacity to form
filopodia and lamellipodia, under unstimulated and
adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-stimulated conditions,
respectively (Figure 7A). The G/F actin ratio was signifi-
cantly higher in the rare patient platelets that spread
(Figure 7B). Furthermore, reduced clot retraction velocity
was noticeable in the mutETV6 (F1-lll7) (Figure 7C). 
Discussion
Herein, we presented six families with AD thrombocy-
topenia associated with germline variants in ETV6.
CD34+-derived megakaryocytes from mutETV6 carriers
showed a reduced ability to form proplatelets. The vari-
ants in the Ets domain impaired interaction with the core-
pressors NCOR, SMRT and Sin3A. Patient platelets were
more round and had a reduced capacity to form filopodia
and lamellipodia, which was associated with reduced
expression levels of cytoskeletal regulators CDC42 and
RHOA. Additionally, mutETV6
carriers displayed
increased numbers of circulating CD34+ progenitor cells,
which may contribute to a predisposition to hematologic
malignancy.
Loss of ETV6 function has been reported to contribute
to leukemia, predominantly due to somatic variants and
fusion transcripts.3
Four amino acid substitutions
described in this study are listed in the Catalog Of Somatic
Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC). The p.P214L, p.R396G
and p.A377T variants were present in digestive tract
tumors,26 while p.Y401C has been associated with AML.27
More recently, germline ETV6 variants have also been
found to predispose to cancer. Eleven patients carrying
mutETV6 (p.P214L, p.R399C, p.R369Q, p.L349P, p.N385fs
or p.W380R) developed acute lymphocytic leukemia or
myelodysplastic syndrome.1-3,28 Two affected members of
the families F1 and F2 had myelodysplasia with RAEB and
one member of the F4 family was successfully treated
with chemotherapy for AML-M0.
Variants reduced the repressive activity of ETV6 with-
out altering ETV6 protein expression levels in platelets.
The alteration of ETV6 repressive activity can be
explained by the modification of ETV6 cellular localiza-
tion, as p.P214L and four other variants affecting the ETS
domain lead to ETV6 sequestration in the cytoplasm in
both HeLa transfected cells and cultured megakary-
ocytes.1-3 However, three of these variants only partially
prevented nuclear localization, thereby indicating other
possible mechanisms. The p.A377T and p.Y401N variants
prevented corepressor complex recruitment. These substi-
tutions are located in the ETV6 Ets second and third 
α-helix, contiguous to amino acids involved in key
hydrophobic contacts with the H5 helix of the C-terminal
inhibitory domain (aa 426-436),29 thus possibly affecting
ETV6 DNA-binding ability. In immunoprecipitation
assays, overexpression of WT or p.P214L ETV6 did not
modify the interaction between SMRT and ETV6, while
p.A377T and p.Y401N ETV6 significantly reduced this
interaction. Overall, this suggests that variants in the Ets
DNA-binding domain exert a dominant negative effect.
ETV6 has been shown to drive megakaryocyte differen-
tiation of hematopoietic stem cells.30 From the literature,
and supported by BM studies in F4-II1 and F5-II2, ETV6
defects seem to result in an increased percentage of small
megakaryocytes.1 Our megakaryocyte colony assays con-
firmed an increased proliferation of early megakaryocyte
progenitors, characterized by an increased production of
CD41+CD42a+ megakaryocytes compared to control con-
ditions. This may explain the reduced TPO levels
observed in the affected members of family F1.
Accordingly, the loss of ETV6 in the erythro-megakary-
ocytic lineage in mice also results in large, highly prolifer-
ative early megakaryocytes and mild thrombocytopenia.
We cannot exclude that ETV6-driven deregulation of
megakaryocyte 
proliferation 
may 
take 
place 
in
hematopoietic progenitors, thereby promoting oncogenic
transformation. Altogether, these data do not support the
concept that signaling between the ETV6 and
RUNX1/FLI1/ANKRD26 pathways is involved in the
underlying mechanism, as variants in these genes were
associated with a decreased or normal megakaryocyte
colony formation.19,31,32 Furthermore, MYH10 expression
levels remained low in patients with mutETV6, which
indicates unaltered RUNX1 and FLI1 function.24
Despite the increased early megakaryocyte proliferation
potential, CD34+-derived megakaryocytes from patients
with mutETV6 showed a reduced capacity to form pro-
platelets. These altered megakaryocyte features suggest
that a defect in cytoskeletal reorganization during pro-
platelet formation likely causes thrombocytopenia in
patients. Sequencing of platelet RNA from patients with
p.P214L ETV6 revealed a considerable reduction in the
levels of several cytoskeletal transcripts.1 Furthermore,
Palmi et al.33 showed that the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion pro-
tein, which is associated with a loss of ETV6 repressive
activity,34,35 alters the expression of genes regulating
cytoskeletal organization. In particular, the ETV6-RUNX1
fusion protein led to reduced expression of CDC42. The
mechanism by which the loss of ETV6 repressive activity
results in reduced CDC42 and RHOA expression remains
to be resolved.
CDC42 is an important mediator of platelet and
megakaryocyte cytoskeleton reorganization.36 Therefore,
we hypothesize that ETV6 repressive activity is a key reg-
ulator of megakaryocyte cytoskeleton remodeling, driven
via Rho GTPases in mutETV6 carriers. mutETV6 was asso-
ciated with a decrease in CDC42 and RHOA expression
levels in platelets without affecting RAC1 expression.
Additionally, mutETV6 platelets showed defects in func-
tions classically associated with CDC42 (i.e., filopodia for-
mation) and RHOA (i.e., lamellipodia formation and clot
retraction).36 EM also showed platelets of variable sizes
and having a more circular instead of discoid shape. RNA
sequencing previously performed on mutETV6 transfected
cells, patient platelets and leukemia cells did not reveal
any modification in Rho GTPase mRNA levels,1,3 which

 may be due to variations in the models applied. Indeed,
Rho GTPase mRNA levels were evaluated in CD34+-
derived megakaryocytes, and the reduced mRNA levels
were confirmed at the protein level in patient platelets.
Moreover, we observed a correlation between platelet
count and CDC42 and RHOA expression levels, thereby
suggesting a relationship between thrombocytopenia
severity and Rho GTPase levels. Key regulators of the
actin cytoskeleton CDC42 and RHOA have already been
shown to be associated with thrombocytopenia, due to
defects in cytoskeleton organization.37-41 In affected indi-
viduals, we found abnormal tubulin organization in pro-
platelet-forming megakaryocytes and altered actin poly-
merization in platelets. Rescue experiments with CDC42
lentiviral particles were not able to fully reverse the phe-
notype, although the cells produced thinner extensions
and swellings, which were barely observed in control
cells.
In mice, Cdc42 or RhoA deficiency causes increased
platelet clearance.37,38 Such an observation was noted in
two patients: one young girl who never received platelets
(F3-II4), and a patient for whom splenectomy improved
the platelet count (F1-III3). This suggests that ETV6 muta-
tions are linked to several defects with reduced platelet
formation and survival, although this latter mechanism
requires further confirmation. 
Individuals carrying a germline ETV6 variant showed
increased numbers of circulating CD34+/CD133+ cells. The
phenotype of these stem cells did not differ between
patients and controls. This increase has to be considered
as a helpful marker of the ETV6-related thrombocytope-
nia. It may not be attributed to excessive proliferation, as
Zhang et al. showed reduced proliferation of CD34+ cells
expressing WT or mutETV6.3 Interestingly, the defect in
CDC42 expression may also account for increased
hematopoietic progenitor mobilization, as chemical inhi-
bition of CDC42 in mice efficiently improved progenitor
recruitment in the peripheral blood. Altered interaction
between mutated progenitors and the BM microenviron-
ment, as reported in the case of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion
protein, may also be involved.33 Further investigations are
required to more precisely delineate the role that ETV6
plays in stem cell progenitor mobilization.
In conclusion, we identified six variants in ETV6, of
which five are novel, associated with dominant thrombo-
cytopenia. Our study provides novel insights into the role
that ETV6 plays in platelet function, morphology and for-
mation that seem to be driven by changes in the
cytoskeleton and potentially also in circulating CD34+ pro-
genitor levels.
