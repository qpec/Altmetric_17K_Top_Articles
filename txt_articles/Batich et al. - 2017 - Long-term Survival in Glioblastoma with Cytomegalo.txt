Abstract
Purpose: Patients with glioblastoma have less than 15-month
median survival despite surgical resection, high-dose radiation,
and chemotherapy with temozolomide. We previously demon-
strated that targeting cytomegalovirus pp65 using dendritic cells
(DC) can extend survival and, in a separate study, that dose-
intensified temozolomide (DI-TMZ) and adjuvant granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) potentiate
tumor-specific immune responses in patients with glioblastoma.
Here, we evaluated pp65-specific cellular responses following DI-
TMZ with pp65-DCs and determined the effects on long-term
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Experimental Design: Following standard-of-care, 11 patients
with newly diagnosed glioblastoma received DI-TMZ (100 mg/
m2/d � 21 days per cycle) with at least three vaccines of pp65
lysosome–associated membrane glycoprotein mRNA-pulsed DCs
admixed with GM-CSF on day 23 � 1 of each cycle. Thereafter,
monthly DI-TMZ cycles and pp65-DCs were continued if patients
had not progressed.
Results: Following DI-TMZ cycle 1 and three doses of pp65-
DCs, pp65 cellular responses significantly increased. After DI-
TMZ, both the proportion and proliferation of regulatory
T cells (Tregs) increased and remained elevated with serial
DI-TMZ cycles. Median PFS and OS were 25.3 months [95%
confidence interval (CI), 11.0–¥] and 41.1 months (95% CI,
21.6–¥), exceeding survival using recursive partitioning anal-
ysis and matched historical controls. Four patients remained
progression-free at 59 to 64 months from diagnosis. No
known prognostic factors [age, Karnofsky performance status
(KPS), IDH-1/2 mutation, and MGMT promoter methylation]
predicted more favorable outcomes for the patients in this
cohort.
Conclusions: Despite increased Treg proportions follow-
ing DI-TMZ, patients receiving pp65-DCs showed long-term
PFS and OS, confirming prior studies targeting cytomegalo-
virus in glioblastoma. Clin Cancer Res; 23(8); 1898–909. �2017

Introduction
Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma have a median
survival of less than 15 months, despite maximal tumor resection,
high-dose radiation, and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy
(1, 2). Novel approaches to therapy are desperately needed.
Several groups, including our own laboratory, have demonstrated
that human cytomegalovirus proteins are expressed in more than
90% of glioblastomas (3–5). Cytomegalovirus expression has not
been detected in surrounding normal brain tissue (3, 4, 6, 7),
which provides an unparalleled opportunity to subvert cytomeg-
alovirus antigens as tumor-specific targets. Recent evidence has
also demonstrated that cytomegalovirus-specific T-cell immunity
can be generated to recognize and effectively kill autologous
glioblastoma tumor cells expressing endogenous levels of the
immunodominant pp65 antigen (8), providing compelling sup-
port for the development of cytomegalovirus-directed immuno-
therapy for the treatment of glioblastoma.
We have recently demonstrated in a small randomized pilot trial
thatpatients whoreceived cytomegaloviruspp65-specificdendritic
cells (pp65-DC) combined with vaccinesite preconditioning using
tetanus-diphtheria toxoid showed significantly improved progres-
sion-free survival (PFS; range, 15.4–47.3 months) and overall

 survival (OS; range, 20.6–47.3 months) compared to controls (9).
In addition, in related trials, we have also demonstrated that dose-
intensified temozolomide (DI-TMZ) and adjuvant granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can enhance
immune responses to tumor-specific antigens in patients with
glioblastoma (10).
In this phase I trial, our primary objective was to evaluate the
safety and feasibility of vaccinating newly diagnosed patients with
pp65-DCs admixed with GM-CSF following host conditioning
with DI-TMZ. Secondary objectives were constructed to investi-
gate patient cellular immune responses induced by pp65-DCs
admixed with GM-CSF and to determine PFS and OS compared
with that expected with standard-of-care. GM-CSF was chosen as
an adjuvant to pp65-DCs on the basis of our own experience with
GM-CSF–containing DCs (VICTORI trial; ref. 11) and peptide
vaccines (ACTIVATE and ACT II trials; refs. 10, 12) and its
previously characterized effects on DC viability and differentia-
tion (13). We chose to administer DI-TMZ in this study also based
on our prior experience that profound lymphopenia following
DI-TMZ can be leveraged to foster de novo expansion of vaccine-
induced antigen-specific immune responses through reactive
homeostatic proliferation (14, 15). Here, we demonstrate that
despite profound lymphopenia and increased Treg proportions
following DI-TMZ, patients with glioblastoma receiving pp65-
DCs showed expansion of antigen-specific immunity and long-
term PFS and OS, confirming earlier studies targeting cytomeg-
alovirus in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
Materials and Methods
Patient selection
Patients were enrolled and treated with the study drug in a
separate clinical study under an overarching parent protocol. The
clinical protocol and informed consent were approved by the U.S.
FDA and Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Duke University
(Durham, NC) for this study (FDA-IND-BB-12839, Duke IRB
Pro00003877, NCT00639639). Eligibility criteria included adults
with a histologically confirmed, newly diagnosed WHO grade IV
glioblastoma. Patients were eligible if they underwent a gross total
resection defined as more than 90% with residual contrast
enhancement of less than 1 cm2 on post-resection MRI, had a
baseline Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score of �80, did
not require continuous steroid therapy above physiologic levels,
and did not receive additional treatments aside from the study
therapy. Histopathology of all specimens was initially read as
glioblastoma, and diagnosis was reconfirmed by a second board-
certified neuropathologist. Both methylguanine methyltransfer-
ase (MGMT) promoter methylation and isocitrate dehydrogenase
(IDH)-1 and IDH-2 mutation analyses were performed by PCR
(16, 17). Given published reports showing high expression of
cytomegalovirus viral proteins in more than 90% of sampled
primary glioblastoma specimens (3, 4, 6, 7), we elected not to
include pp65 staining of tumor tissue as an eligibility criterion for
patients enrolled on this trial.
Historical controls
A cohort of historical controls at least double the sample size of
our study cohort was used to compare survival rates of patients
receiving our study drug with similar patients receiving other
therapies. Historical controls had histopathology-confirmed pri-
mary glioblastoma, with 23 of 23 being negative for the IDH-1
mutation and mixed MGMT methylator phenotype (12 negative,
5 positive, 6 not available). Historical controls were treated
similarly to study patients with initial gross total resection and
standard 6-week radiation therapy (XRT)/temozolomide. If no
progressive disease occurred at this point, historical controls
proceeded to receive monthly standard temozolomide cycles
(150–200 mg/m2/d � 5 days) and did not receive any other
therapies until progression. Those controls who did progress after
the completion of standard therapy were offered additional
therapies, including bevacizumab, etoposide, irinotecan, CCNU,
vorinostat, and heat-shock protein targeted therapies.
Study design
Eligible patients underwent initial leukapheresis (pheresis-1)
prior to XRT/TMZ for immunologic monitoring and subsequent
ex vivo differentiation of autologous DCs. Each patient then
completed a 6-week course of conformal external beam XRT to
a dose of 60 Gy with concurrent temozolomide at a targeted daily
dose of 75 mg/m2/d. Upon completion of standard chemoradia-
tion therapy, all patients were re-imaged with MRI for evidence of
progressive disease. Those with evidence of progressive disease or
requiring steroid therapy in excess of physiological levels (>2 mg/
d of dexamethasone) at the time vaccination was scheduled did
not continue on study. At 4 weeks following standard XRT/TMZ,
the first DI-TMZ cycle (100 mg/m2/d) was administered over the
course of 21 days of a 28-day cycle, and DC vaccine-1 was
administered on day 23 � 1 of that 28-day cycle. For each
pp65-DC vaccine, an intradermal injection of 2 � 107 pp65
mRNA-pulsed DCs admixed with 150 mg GM-CSF in 0.4 mL of
saline was administered bilaterally in the groin. Following DC
vaccine-3, patients underwent a second leukapheresis (pheresis-
2) for immunologic monitoring and subsequent ex vivo differen-
tiation of autologous DCs. From DC vaccine-3 and onward,
patients received monthly DC vaccines in conjunction with sub-
sequent DI-TMZ cycles every 5 � 1 weeks for a total of 6 to 12
cycles at the discretion of the treating neuro-oncologist. DCs were
Translational Relevance
The highly aggressive and therapeutically resistant nature of
glioblastoma is evidenced by a median survival of less than 15
months. More precise and efficacious therapies are desperately
needed. Several groups have demonstrated that cytomegalo-
virus proteins are expressed in more than 90% of sampled
glioblastomas. Moreover, cytomegalovirus antigen expression
is restricted to glioma cells and not surrounding normal brain,
providing the opportunity to subvert cytomegalovirus pro-
teins as tumor-specific immunotherapy targets. In this study,
we targeted the cytomegalovirus antigen pp65 using dendritic
cells (DC) in combination with dose-intensified temozolo-
mide and evaluated patient antitumor immune responses and
survival. Despite increases in regulatory T-cell proportions
after temozolomide, patients treated with pp65-DCs showed
increased pp65 immunity and long-term survival extending
beyond predicted rates, fortifying prior studies that target
cytomegalovirus antigens in glioblastoma. Randomized stud-
ies on the prevention of generated regulatory T cells in the
context of temozolomide treatment and cytomegalovirus tar-
geting are under way.

 given on day 23 � 1 of each 28-day temozolomide cycle for a total
of 10 vaccines unless progression occurred. Patients were imaged
bimonthly and did not receive any other prescribed antitumor
therapy.
Safety and adverse events
All patients were monitored for treatment-related toxicity.
Adverse events (AE) and serious AEs (SAE) were graded according
to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria
for AEs (Version 3.0). Safety checkpoints were defined to halt the
study if any 2 patients experienced a drug-related grade IV or
irreversible grade III toxicity.
DC vaccine generation
Autologous DCs were generated using the method used by
Romani and colleagues (18, 19). After harvest, cells were frozen
and assessed for contamination and lineage purity as previously
published (20). The 1.932-kB pp65 full-length cDNA insert was
obtained from Dr. Bill Britt (University of Alabama-Birmingham,
Birmingham, AL), and RNA was generated and transfected as
previously reported (9).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell processing
In addition to leukapheresis, blood draws for pp65 enzyme-
linked immunoSpot (ELISpot) assays were performed just prior
to vaccination with pp65-DCs. Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) were separated from blood collected in ACD
tubes within 4 hours of blood collection using Histopaque
(Sigma) and stored in liquid nitrogen. On the day of testing,
patient PMBCs were rapidly thawed, washed, rested overnight
in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS and additives (21), and processed
for absolute cell count and viability on a Guava easyCyte flow
cytometer (Merck KGaA).
IFNg ELISpot
Patient pp65 responses were measured ex vivo by direct IFNg
ELISpot. PBMCs were stimulated overnight with a pool of syn-
thetic peptides spanning cytomegalovirus pp65 (15 mers over-
lapping by 11 amino acids with >95% purity), kindly provided by
Dr. Robert A. Olmsted (Alphavax, Inc.). ELISpot plates coated
with mouse IgG1 anti-human IFNg monoclonal antibody were
incubated overnight at 37�C, 5% CO2, washed with PBS/Tween-
20, incubated with biotinylated mouse IgG1 anti-human IFNg for
1 hour at room temperature, washed with PBS, incubated with
avidin/peroxidase complex for 1 hour at room temperature,
washed, and incubated with substrate (3-amino-9-ethylcarba-
zole) for 4 minutes at room temperature. Spot enumeration was
performed in a blinded fashion by Zellnet Consulting, Inc. using a
KS ELISpot reader (Zeiss Inc.), software version KS 4.9.16 using
established guidelines (22). Results were expressed as the mean
spot-forming cells (SFC)/106 PBMC after subtraction of back-
ground counts from PBMCs cultured without peptide. Negative
values were raised to zero for mean calculations. Positive and
negative control PBMCs for pp65 (from Dr. Robert A. Olmsted)
were qualified and validated by precision and intermediate pre-
cision testing using pp65 standardized peptide pools. The criteria
for a valid assay required control wells with cytomegalovirus
pp65–positive control > 692 SFC/106 PBMC and negative control
< 9 SFC/106 PBMC.
Treg analysis
PBMC surface antigens were stained with CD4-FITC (RPA-T4),
CD25-APC (MA251), Ki67-PE (B56), and CD127-PE (hIL-7R-
M21; BD Bioscience). After washing to remove unbound antibody,
cells were incubated on ice for 30 minutes in fixation/permeabi-
lization buffer (eBioscience). Cells were washed again with 1�
permeabilization buffer (eBioscience), pelleted, and stained with
FOXP3-APC (PCH101, eBioscience). Samples were acquired on
BD FACS Calibur (BD) and analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar). Tregs
were defined as CD25þFOXP3þ of CD4þ lymphocytes.
Disease progression
Progressive disease was defined radiographically according to
the RANO criteria and defined as (i) at least a 25% increase in the
longest diameter on an axial image of any enhancing tumor on
consecutive CT or MRI images or (ii) the appearance of a new
radiographically demonstrable lesion measuring �1 cm in any 2
perpendicular axial planes (23). Upon tumor progression,
patients could undergo stereotactic biopsy or resection for con-
firmation with additional consent.
Statistical analysis
For sample size estimation, patients in this phase I study were
recruited in a single-arm fashion to evaluate safety and feasibility
as the primary endpoint. No a priori power calculations were used
for secondary endpoints. Therefore, a final sample size matching
that of the prior study (9) was calculated to ensure at least 6
evaluable subjects. For paired comparisons between 2 time points
and for fold change comparisons, a Wilcoxon signed rank test was
used to determine statistical significance. Patients were enrolled
over the course of 2 years and a lock date 4.25 years after the last
patient enrolled was applied for survival analysis of censored data
(patients who had not progressed and were alive at the time of
analysis). PFS was defined as the time from histologic diagnosis at
surgery until radiographic or clinical progression and was cen-
sored at the lock date if the patient remained alive without disease
progression at the time of analysis. OS was defined as the time
from histologic diagnosis until death and was censored at the
lock date if the patient remained alive at the time of analysis.
Median PFS and OS were estimated using Kaplan–Meier methods,
and comparisons with historical controls used the log-rank test.
Predicted survival utilized known prognostic factors under the
recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) classification (24), with
observed–expected survival calculated for each patient.
Results
Patient population
A total of 14 patients were initially enrolled in the study
(schema shown in Fig. 1). The study therapy was defined as
completion of DI-TMZ cycle 1 and DC vaccines 1 to 3 without
additionally prescribed therapies. Two patients were excluded
from immune response analyses, as they were not eligible for
study participation due to treatment with bevacizumab at outside
hospitals. One patient discontinued protocol treatment prior to
DC vaccine-3 due to disease progression. Primary immune
response analysis is based on the 11 patients who received at
least 3 pp65-DC vaccinations.
Patients on study had a median age of 55 years and median KPS
of 90 at diagnosis (Table 1).To account for the possibility that
certain prognostic factors could have selected for more favorable

 patient outcomes, we analyzed primary glioblastoma specimens
for IDH-1 and IDH-2 mutations (16) and promoter methylation
of MGMT (17). All patient specimens that could be sampled (10
of 11) were negative for IDH mutations. No significant differences
in survival were seen in patients with MGMT promoter methyl-
ation (5 of 11), although this study was not powered to assess this
variable as a prognostic marker for survival. RPA class incorpo-
rating KPS and age at diagnosis was used to evaluate expected
survival for each patient. Observed–expected survival rates based
upon the RPA showed a gain in survival for each of the 11 patients
receiving at least 3 vaccines, with a median gain of 30 months for
the entire cohort (Table 1).
Toxicity and adverse events
Patients on study were monitored for toxicity and AEs defined
according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity
Criteria (Version 3.0). No patients experienced AEs related to the
cellular portion of the pp65-DC vaccine, yet one single AE was
noted and attributable to GM-CSF administration. This was
classified as a severe (grade III) vaccine-related immunologic
reaction, which occurred shortly after vaccine-8. Immunologic
workup for this patient revealed sensitization to the GM-CSF
component of the vaccine and the production of high levels of
anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies during vaccination (25). Removal of
GM-CSF from the DC vaccine allowed continued vaccination
(total of 10 vaccines) without incident for this patient. No other
study drug AEs were detected.
Patient survival
Patients in this study administered at least 3 vaccines of pp65-
DCs with concomitant DI-TMZ showed significantly increased
PFS (Fig. 2A) and OS (Fig. 2B) compared with historical controls
(n ¼ 23) matched for age, gender, tumor, and standard-of-care
treatment. To counter any potential for selection bias of historical

Schema of ATTAC-GM trial. Following standard-of-care with gross total resection (>90%), external beam radiation (XRT) and temozolomide, patients received
DI-TMZ cycle 1 (100 mg/m2/d) for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. DC vaccines consisted of 2 � 107 mature pp65 lysosome–associated membrane glycoprotein (LAMP)
mRNA-pulsed DCs (pp65-DCs) admixed with 150 mg GM-CSF. Vaccination with pp65-DCs occurred on day 23 � 1 of the 28-day cycle with the first 3 DC
vaccines administered 2 weeks apart. Following DI-TMZ cycle 2 and DC vaccine-4, patients then received monthly DC vaccines administered on DI-TMZ cycle day
23 � 1 for a total of 10 vaccines in conjunction with monthly DI-TMZ cycles for a total of 6 to 12 cycles unless progression occurred. Patients were imaged
bimonthly without receiving any other prescribed antitumor therapy. For immune monitoring of pp65 responses, PBMCs were sampled at pheresis-1 and
pheresis-2, along with blood draws just prior to vaccination with pp65-DCs.

 controls, a sample size at least double our study cohort was
randomly selected from a large database of patients who had
resection and were treated contemporaneously over the course of
2 years at our institution. Selection criteria for these controls
included identical demographics (age, gender, histopathology-
confirmed glioblastoma) and tumor molecular pathology char-
acteristics (IDH-1–negative and mixed MGMT promoter methyl-
ation) as well as identical standard-of-care treatment, including
gross total resection and standard 6-week XRT/TMZ. Historical
controls did not receive any other therapies until progression was
documented. Those with progressive disease after the completion
of standard therapy were offered additional therapies. Apart from
this caveat of additional therapies, patients on our study still
showed markedly prolonged PFS and OS compared with matched
historical controls (median PFS 25.3 vs. 8.0 months, P ¼ 0.0001;
median OS 41.1 vs. 19.2 months, P ¼ 0.0001, log-rank test).
When compared with RPA class predicted median survival
(24), we found that 100% of these patients exceeded expected
median survival, with a median gain in survival of 30 months
(Table 1). In addition, 4 of these 11 patients remained progres-
sion-free 59 to 64 months from initial surgery. The one enrolled
patient who did not receive at least 3 vaccinations progressed at
5.3 months and died at 9.4 months from diagnosis. With inclu-
sion of this patient in survival analyses, the median PFS and OS
were 20 and 33.4 months, respectively.
Patient cytomegalovirus pp65 immune responses
Of the 11 patients treated with DI-TMZ and at least 3 vaccines
of pp65-DCs, all but one demonstrated an increase in pp65
IFNg ELISpot between baseline and pheresis-2 that occurred
after the third pp65-DC vaccine (P ¼ 0.019; Fig. 3A). Following
reintroduction of DI-TMZ cycle 2 after pheresis-2, functional
(IFNg-secreting) pp65 responses had diminished toward base-
line levels and remained suppressed throughout DI-TMZ cycles
3 to 6 (Fig. 3B).
All 11 patients received at least 7 vaccines of pp65-DCs and
were eligible to receive a maximum of 10 total vaccines if they had
not progressed. Monthly DI-TMZ cycles starting from cycle 2 to a
total of 12 cycles were administered at the discretion of the
treating neuro-oncologist. The 4 long-term survivors in this study
received 10 vaccines, and each demonstrated an expansion in
pp65 responses following DC vaccines 1–3 when DI-TMZ was
held. IFNg activity stimulated by pp65 then diminished for these
patients once DI-TMZ cycles 2 and on were resumed (Supple-
mentary Fig. S1).
Moreover, the extent of pp65 IFNg increased early on from DC
vaccines 1–3 seem to be important for clinical responses in these
long-term survivors, as those with extended OS > 40 months
showed a much more significant expansion in pp65 responses
from baseline (prior to vaccine-1) to pheresis-2 (after 3 vaccines)
compared with those with OS < 40 months (post-vaccine-3, P ¼
0.031; Fig. 3C). The2 patients with the greatest foldchanges (open

of analysis) and at 41.1 months.
A tetramer analysis was performed for 6 patients, using com-
mercially available pp65 tetramer for available HLA types. The
percentage of pp65 tetramer–positive CD8þ T cells began to
increase following DI-TMZ cycle 1, likely due to the homeostatic
expansion of several antigen-specific populations (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Tetramer positivity did remain elevated after 3 DC vaccina-
tions to pheresis-2. Tetramer-positive CD8þ T cells then decreased
at vaccine-4 after reinitiating DI-TMZ with cycle 2, similar to the
decline in functional pp65-ELISpot responses in Fig. 3B. Because
tetramer detection more so indicates cellular phenotype rather than
function, we chose to optimize the pp65 ELISpot assay to monitor
pp65 functional responses by directly stimulating PBMCs with the
pp65 epitope and measuring IFNg output with background sub-
traction of nonspecific IFNg-secreting cells. Using the pp65 IFNg

 functional responses against the pp65 antigen were boosted by
pp65-DC vaccines 1–3 and subsequently diminished by the con-
tinuation of monthly DI-TMZ cycles.
Radiographic changes to MRI scans
MRI scans were performed for all patients within 3 weeks
following completion of standard XRT/TMZ (75 mg/m2/d). We
performed a retrospective assessment, with secondary review by a
radiation-oncologist and neuro-oncologist, of MRI scans for
patients with shorter survival times. Overall, serial MRI scans for
these patients demonstrated the usual trend in progressive fea-
tures, including increasing FLAIR signal from baseline post-XRT/
TMZ scans and increased nodular enhancement on T1-weighted
contrast images within the resection cavity, both of which were
concerning for progressive disease.
For the 4 long-term survivors, MRI scans at baseline post XRT/
TMZ, post-vaccine-3, and post-vaccine-6 showed a trend of (i)
stable or steadily FLAIR signal and edema during recovery from
XRT and standard 6-week temozolomide therapy, (ii) no new T1
contrast enhancement along resection margins or additional sites,
and (iii) gradual collapse of the resection cavity (Fig. 4A). Inter-
estingly, in 2 patients with extended OS at 60.7 and 46.5 months
(patients 4 and 7), after repeated DC vaccination, satellite hyper-
intensities that did not enhance with contrast appeared a consid-
erable distance from the resection site (Fig. 4B). Notably, these
lesions did not appear in any of the patients with <40-month OS,
were not originally present following XRT/TMZ, and were calcu-
lated to be outside of XRT high-dose radiation fields, thus unlikely
to represent radiation-induced damage. Because of limitations of
this retrospective analysis, the clinical significance of these lesions
was not determined, whether these changes represent satellite
sites of immune-activation related to DC vaccination or present as
coincidental age-related changes in this population. Nonetheless,
they remain an interesting feature of patients receiving repeated
vaccination with pp65-DCs.
Treg reconstitution with temozolomide-induced
lymphopenia
Following DI-TMZ cycle 1, the proportion of Tregs among
CD4þ T cells increased (P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 5A). Treg proportions
also steadily increased from pheresis-2 to vaccine-7 (Fig. 5B).
Interestingly, Treg proliferation, as assessed by Ki67þ staining,
increased following the initiation of DI-TMZ cycle 1 (P ¼
0.002; Fig. 5C) and then progressively declined between vac-
cine-1 and pheresis-2 when DI-TMZ was held. Following lym-
phodepletion, Tregs have been shown to reconstitute quite early
in response to an increased pool of homeostatic cytokines (26–
28). Here, Tregs exhibited proliferation following DI-TMZ lym-
phodepletion. Once DI-TMZ cycle 2 was initiated, a steady rate of
proliferation was noted and persisted with subsequent DI-TMZ
cycles (Fig. 5D).
As Treg proportions increased significantly following DI-TMZ
cycle 1 (Fig. 5), both peripheral CD4þ and CD8þ numbers
decreased (Fig. 6A and C). Although Treg proportions remained
elevated throughout sequential pp65-DCs from vaccine-1 to
vaccine-3, CD8þ numbers and CD8:Treg ratios steadily increased
amidst this high proportion of Tregs (Fig. 6A and B). Conven-
tional CD4þ and CD4:Treg ratios were seemingly unaffected by
sequential pp65-DCs (Fig. 6C and D).
Discussion
This study corroborates prior studies targeting cytomegalovirus
pp65 in newly diagnosed glioblastoma and demonstrates that
cytomegalovirus DC vaccines can increase pp65 immunity
despite lymphodepleting and even DI-TMZ while leading to
unexpectedly prolonged PFS and OS. In our prior study, we
demonstrated that patients randomized to pp65-DCs with teta-
nus-diphtheria (Td) toxoid vaccine site preconditioning had
significantly improved PFS and OS compared to the control
cohort (OSTd ¼ 20.6–47.3 months vs. OSunpulsed DC ¼ 13.8–

long-term PFS and OS for patients with newly diagnosed glio-

diagnosed glioblastoma including RPA class, MGMT status,
and extent of resection (29).
Our study suggests that DI-TMZ is more efficacious if used in
concert with antigen-specific vaccination for glioblastoma. T-
cell responses were expanded by pp65-DC vaccines in an
antigen-specific manner following DI-TMZ. From vaccine-1 to
vaccine-3, all but one patient showed significant expansion in
pp65 immunity. Suspending repetitive DI-TMZ cycles during
these first 3 pp65-DC vaccines proved beneficial, as pp65-
specific immune responses continued to increase during this
period. The extent of pp65 IFNg increases early on from DC
vaccines 1–3 was relevant to patient survival, as those with
extended OS > 40 months showed a much more significant
expansion in pp65 responses after 3 DC vaccines compared
with those with OS < 40 months. However, with the reintro-
duction of DI-TMZ after pheresis-2, pp65 responses dimin-
ished, elucidating that repeated monthly DI-TMZ cycles may

 be detrimental to maintaining IFNg activity with later vacci-
nation of pp65-DCs. This can most notably be appreciated via
the kinetics of pp65 responses in the 4 long-term survivors from
vaccine-4 to vaccine-10.
This is not unexpected given the known effects of temozo-
lomide on peripheral lymphocyte counts in the blood (10, 30).
Thus, our results highlight that the timing of vaccination with
pp65-DCs in relation to DI-TMZ or any lymphodepleting drug
is an important consideration in generating robust immune
responses.
All 11 patients received at least 7 vaccines of pp65-DCs. The
kinetics of pp65 vaccine responses showed a significant decline
at vaccine-4. This diminished response may have been a result
of (i) natural contraction in pp65 reactivity following a one
month latency between vaccine-3 and vaccine-4 or (ii) a pos-
sible detrimental effect of DI-TMZ cycle 2 depleting pp65-
specific effector T cells. Following vaccine-5, when monthly
DI-TMZ
and
monthly
pp65-DCs
were
administered,
we
observed a slight upward trend in mean pp65 reactivity at
vaccine-7, mostly driven by increases in 5 of the 11 patients.
Since all patients received at least 7 vaccines, this mean increase
was not a result of patient dropout. In addition, at this stage of
the vaccination schedule, the memory repertoire of patient
pp65-specific T cells may have expanded and adopted a more
resilient phenotype to DI-TMZ lymphodepletion. The recruit-
ment of DNA damage repair mechanisms has been described in
memory CD8þ T-cell populations expressing the DNA repair
enzyme MGMT (31). Such expression may have played a role in
memory T-cell kinetics at this point in the vaccination schedule
amidst monthly DI-TMZ. Nonetheless, studies are underway to
investigate mechanisms underlying such memory T-cell resis-
tance to temozolomide.
Our previous studies characterize how increased Treg fractions
govern cellular immune defects in patients with glioblastoma
and underscore the deleterious effects of Tregs on vaccine-medi-
ated immunotherapy (32, 33). During recovery from lympho-
depleted states, remnant T-cell pools undergo homeostatic
expansion through proliferation (14, 27, 28, 34). Tregs represent
a portion of the depleted T-cell repertoire and not only prolif-
erate early in this recovery but do so rapidly in response to high
levels of the host cytokine IL2 (26–28, 35). In the present study,
patients exhibited an increase in Treg proportions as a result of
increased proliferation following a single cycle of DI-TMZ. This is
not surprising, as previous studies demonstrate increased Treg
proportions in patients with glioblastoma following STD-TMZ
(35) and DI-TMZ regimens (10). After the initial peak, Treg
proliferation gradually declined from vaccine-1 to pheresis-2
whereas pp65 responses simultaneously increased, indicating
that while DI-TMZ still resulted in elevated Treg fractions, this
did not appear to limit the induction of pp65 antigen–specific
cellular
responses.
Elevated
Treg
proportions
throughout
sequential pp65-DC vaccination did not seem to affect periph-
eral CD8þ numbers, as CD8þ counts and CD8:Treg ratios
steadily increased during this interval. Expansion of CD8þ T-
cell numbers and functional pp65 responses may have been
resilient to Treg suppression immediately following this peak, as
provision of an antigen-specific vaccine in the context of lym-
phodepletion might have superseded homeostatically expand-
ing Tregs (36–38). However, our findings raise the question if
targeting Tregs during points of maximal proliferation could
further enhance pp65 T-cell responses. A potential strategy
previously published by our group employs monoclonal anti-
body blockade of the IL2 receptor a (IL2R a/CD25) to effec-
tively deplete Tregs without impairing effector pp65 T-cell
responses, and this is under further investigation in our 2-arm
phase I study (NCT00626483; ref. 35).
In conclusion, our study results confirm our prior findings that
cytomegalovirus pp65 represents a targetable axis in newly diag-
nosed glioblastoma resulting in patient survival far exceeding that
of predicted outcomes and observed rates in historical controls.
Patients in our study showed notably extended median PFS (25.3
months) and OS (41.1 months) compared with age-matched
patients in the RTOG 0525 trial (n ¼ 422) who similarly received
21-day DI-TMZ cycles following the 6-week standard chemora-
diation therapy (median PFS and OS, 6.7 and 14.9 months).
Although eligibility criteria in our study differed from those in the
RTOG trial (partial and total resection, KPS � 60), patients shared
similar characteristics with respect to age, MGMT methylation
status, and RPA class. We recognize that in our study, the efficacy
of DI-TMZ alone was not directly compared with DI-TMZ and
pp65-DC vaccination, but given the results from the RTOG trial,
DI-TMZ used independently is unlikely to improve outcomes in
this patient population according to recent data (29). However,
our prior clinical study demonstrated that DI-TMZ–induced
lymphopenia, when provided with antigen-specific vaccination,
resulted in superior immune responses compared with STD-TMZ
dosing (10). Here, using pp65 as a different antigen in glioblas-
toma, we were able to validate these prior findings, demonstrat-
ing that DI-TMZ is best utilized in concert with a vaccine to
generate robust antigen-specific immunity. What remains to be
determined is whether this combinatorial regimen is strictly
dependent on antigen specificity, a question that is best suited
for future randomization studies. Overall, our results strengthen
prior findings from other trials targeting cytomegalovirus and
provide evidence for the association between pp65 targeting in
glioblastoma and long-term survival.
