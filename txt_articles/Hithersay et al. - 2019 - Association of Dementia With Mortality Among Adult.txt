IMPORTANCE This work quantifies the fatal burden of dementia associated with Alzheimer
disease in individuals with Down syndrome (DS).
OBJECTIVE To explore the association of dementia associated with Alzheimer disease with
mortality and examine factors associated with dementia in adults with DS.
DESIGN, SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective longitudinal study in a community setting
in England. Data collection began March 29, 2012. Cases were censored on December 13,
2017. The potential sample consisted of all adults 36 years and older from the London Down
Syndrome Consortium cohort with 2 data times and dementia status recorded (N = 300);
6 withdrew from study, 28 were lost to follow-up, and 55 had a single data collection point at
time of analysis. The final sample consisted of 211 participants, with 503.92 person-years’
follow-up.
EXPOSURES Dementia status, age, sex, APOE genotype, level of intellectual disability, health
variables, and living situation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Crude mortality rates, time to death, and time to dementia
diagnosis with proportional hazards of predictors.
RESULTS Of the 211 participants, 96 were women (45.5%) and 66 (31.3%) had a clinical
dementia diagnosis. Twenty-seven participants (11 female; mean age at death, 56.74 years)
died during the study period. Seventy percent had dementia. Crude mortality rates for
individuals with dementia (1191.85 deaths per 10 000 person-years; 95% CI, 1168.49-1215.21)
were 5 times higher than for those without (232.22 deaths per 10 000 person-years; 95% CI,
227.67-236.77). For those with dementia, APOE ε4 carriers had a 7-fold increased risk of death
(hazard ratio [HR], 6.91; 95% CI, 1.756-27.195). For those without dementia, epilepsy with
onset after age 36 years was associated with mortality (HR, 9.66; 95% CI, 1.59-58.56). APOE
ε4 carriers (HR, 4.91; 95% CI, 2.53-9.56), adults with early-onset epilepsy (HR, 3.61; 95% CI,
1.12-11.60), multiple health comorbidities (HR, 1.956; 95% CI, 1.087-3.519), and those living
with family (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.08-4.20) received significantly earlier dementia diagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Dementia was associated with mortality in 70% of older
adults with DS. APOE ε4 carriers and/or people with multiple comorbid health conditions
were at increased risk of dementia and death, highlighting the need for good health care.
For those who died without a dementia diagnosis, late-onset epilepsy was the only significant
factor associated with death, raising questions about potentially undiagnosed dementia cases
in this group.

 D
own syndrome (DS) results from trisomy of chromo-
some21andisassociatedwithmultiplehealthandcog-
nitive comorbidities including congenital heart de-
fects and intellectual disability (ID).1 Fifty years ago, life
expectancy for those with DS was just 10 years, with congen-
ital heart defects responsible for most deaths within the first
year.2 Medical advances have since increased mean survival
to 63.5 years, yet people with DS still die a mean of 13 years
before those without.3 Respiratory diseases are now the most
frequently cited primary causes of death in adults with DS,2,3
with evidence that reduced mobility, poor vision, and epi-
lepsy are each associated with reduced survival in later years.4
However, this increasing life expectancy in DS has also re-
vealed an exceptional risk for developing dementia, driven by
the near-universal neuropathology of Alzheimer disease (AD)
by adulthood.5 Understanding how this disease burden is as-
sociated with mortality in this aging population is of primary
importance for providing appropriate prognostic informa-
tion, care, and research into potential AD treatments for those
both with and without DS.
Alzheimer disease neuropathology in DS stems from trip-
lication of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chro-
mosome 21.6,7 Recent mouse model research has found that
triplication of other chromosome 21 genes can also increase
amyloid-β deposition and worsen cognitive deficits,8 al-
though these genes may also have different modulatory and
protective roles in AD progression, as suggested by differ-
ences between DS-AD and non-DS familial early-onset AD
caused by duplication of the APP locus alone.9 The dementia
burden this causes in DS is striking: the mean age of demen-
tia diagnosis is 55 years,10 and as many as 88% of this popu-
lation can be expected to develop dementia by age 65 years.11
However, there is great variability in the age of dementia
onset, with some individuals surviving past age 60 years with
no clear signs of cognitive decline.12 Some dementia risk fac-
tors seen in the non-DS population similarly play a role in the
variability of onset in those with DS. For example, possession
of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2 allele shows a protective in-
fluence, whereas APOE ε4 increases dementia risk.13 Demo-
graphic factors may also influence detection of cognitive de-
cline by caregivers; there is evidence that those who remain
living with their family are likely to receive a diagnosis earlier
than those in other living situations.10
SeizuredevelopmentiscloselylinkedwithdementiainDS.
Forty-three percent of those without a previous history of epi-
lepsy develop seizures within a median of 2 years following
dementia diagnosis, with most developing generalized tonic-
clonic seizures or myoclonic jerks as dementia progresses.14
Long-standing epilepsy, present before dementia diagnosis,
may shorten survival time after a diagnosis of dementia in
individuals with DS,10 and there is also evidence that taking
antidementia mediation can extend survival.10
Although it has been reported that 20 times more people
with DS have dementia recorded as a contributory factor on
their death certificate than those without DS,15 further stud-
ies are required to quantify the association that dementia has
directly with mortality risk in those with DS, as well as explor-
ing factors that may modify mortality and dementia risk in this
population. Better information about factors associated with
dementia onset and prognosis will also support the develop-
ment of clinical trials of treatments.
This study aimed to examine the effect of dementia on
crude mortality rates (CMRs) in a large, representative cohort
of older individuals with DS in the United Kingdom. Second-
ary analyses were used to evaluate the influence of addi-
tional health and demographic factors on age at death and at
dementia diagnosis.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
Data were acquired as part of a large, prospective longitudi-
nalstudyofcognitionandhealthinadultswithDSintheUnited
Kingdom.16 Ethical approval was secured from the North-
West Wales Research Ethics Committee (13/WA/0194). Partici-
pation in the primary study was open to all adults with DS,
regardless of capacity to consent. Capacity was assessed for
each participant at each time, and written informed consent
was obtained from all those who were able. A consultee (typi-
cally a family member or paid carer) was appointed for indi-
viduals without capacity. The consultee was asked to sign a
form to indicate their decision about the individual’
s inclu-
sion based on their knowledge of the individual and their
wishes, in accordance with the UK Mental Capacity Act 2005.
Participants
Participants were recruited from DS support groups, care
homes,existingparticipantdatabases,andNationalHealthSer-
vices sites in England. Down syndrome status was confirmed
genetically where possible (n = 193 of 211 successfully karyo-
typed). To be eligible for inclusion, participants were re-
quired to be 36 years or older at study entry, to have at least 2
data points (mean length of follow-up, 28.66 months; range,
1-65 months). and to have their clinical dementia status known
to the informant.
Data Sources/Measurements
Data for all variables were collected as part of a prospective,
longitudinal study. Medical history and demographic details
were acquired through a semistructured interview with a carer
Key Points
Question How does dementia status influence mortality in people
with Down syndrome?
Findings In a longitudinal study including 211 adults with Down
syndrome 36 years and older, 27 people died during follow-up
(mean, 28; range, 1-65 months), and dementia was the proximate
cause of death in 70% of cases. Crude mortality rates were 5 times
higher in those with dementia than those without.
Meaning Nearly all older adults with Down syndrome now have
dementia when they die, making this a vital population for
researching disease progression, modifying factors, and potential
treatments.

 who knew the participant well. APOE genotype was con-
firmed via blood or saliva sample using a Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific Taqman assay for single-nucleotide polymorphisms
rs7412 and rs429358.
Statistics
Crude mortality rates were calculated using total months of
follow-up time for the whole sample and split by dementia sta-
tus. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to examine survival
time for those with and without a dementia diagnosis. To ex-
plore factors predicting mortality, Cox proportional hazard
models were computed separately for those with and with-
out dementia, using age at exit (or death) as the time variable.
Each predictor variable was entered into an independent
predictor model in the first instance. Variables significantly as-
sociated with mortality were then combined in a final model,
using the enter method. To explore factors associated with di-
agnosis of dementia, Cox regression models were computed
using the same predictor variables but using age at diagnosis/
exit from study as the timing variable.
Variables
Time-to-event analyses were computed for death and demen-
tia diagnosis. Dementia status was obtained through carer re-
port, based on independent clinical diagnosis by partici-
pants’ regular clinicians after comprehensive clinical
assessment. In the United Kingdom, individuals with DS are
typically diagnosed as having dementia after specialist assess-
ment in ID services; these expert clinical diagnoses have been
shown to be reliable and valid.17 To confirm dementia status,
2 ID psychiatrists independently reviewed dementia symp-
toms for a sample of individuals blind to original clinical
diagnosesusingitemsmappingtoInternationalStatisticalClas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Re-

 interview of the Cambridge Examination of Mental Disorders
of Older People With Down Syndrome and Others With Intel-
lectual Disabilities.18 The presence of significant cognitive de-
cline owing to dementia was confirmed in 86% of individuals
and the remaining 14% showing some degree of cognitive de-
cline (possible dementia) (total n = 36). Because dementia is
a progressive disease with a prodromal period spanning many
years, individuals diagnosed during follow-up were included
in the dementia group. Time variables included length in
months from study entry to exit for CMR calculations and age
in years at event (death or dementia diagnosis) or exit for haz-
ard ratio calculations. The latest data collection point was used
as the exit date for censored cases. Cases were censored on De-
cember 13, 2017.
Predementia level of ID was obtained via carer report of
the participants’peak level of functioning, based on Interna-
tional Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems, Tenth Revision characteristics of mild, moderate, se-
vere, or profound ID. Categories were collapsed to produce a
binary variable (mild/moderate vs severe/profound).

ing to the opposing effects of alleles ε2 and ε4.
Living situation split those living with family from those
in other living situations including supported accommoda-
tion, care homes, and residential homes. Additional factors of
interest included sex, presence of early-onset (before age 20
years) and late-onset (older than 36 years) epilepsy, hypothy-
roidism, congenital heart defects, cataracts, dementia medi-
cation, antipsychotic medication, obesity (defined as having
a body mass index greater than 30 [calculated as weight in ki-
lograms divided by height in meters squared]), and a binary
multimorbidity score (0 = none or 1 comorbid condition; 1 = 2
or more conditions). Health conditions included in this score
and the list of drugs counted in the medication variables are
listed in the eMethods of the Supplement.
Results
Sample
Two hundred eleven people (96 women) were included in
the final sample, giving 503.92 person-years of follow-up:
344.50 person-years from those without dementia and
159.42 person-years from those who received a clinical
dementia diagnosis (n = 66). The mean (SD) age of dementia
diagnosis overall was 51.98 (7.09) years (n = 65, data missing
from 1 participant); 50.83 (5.72) years for women; and 53.41
(8.38) years for men. Table 1 displays participant characteris-
tics by dementia status.
Crude Mortality Rates
Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier survival function for those
with and without a diagnosis of dementia; estimated median
survival times were 67 and 72 years, respectively. Twenty-
seven participants (11 women) died during the follow-up pe-
riod. The median age at death was 57 years (57 years for men
and 54 years for women). Nineteen participants (70.37%) had
a clinical diagnosis of dementia, 9 of whom were women
(47.37%). Ten men (62.5%) and 9 women (81.8%) who died had
a diagnosis of dementia. The median age at death was 57 years
for those without dementia and 55 years for those with de-
mentia. During the follow-up period, 28.78% of the dementia
group (n = 19) died compared with 5.52% of those without de-
mentia (n = 8). The CMR across the whole sample was 535.80
deaths per 10 000 person-years (95% CI, 529.30-550.30); for
those with dementia, the CMR was 1191.85 deaths per 10 000
person-years (95% CI, 1168.49-1215.21); and for those with-
out a dementia diagnosis, the CMR was 232.22 deaths per
10 000 person-years (95% CI, 227.67-236.77).
Of the 8 participants who died without a clinical diagno-
sis of dementia, 2 had late-onset epilepsy, and 1 was reported
to be showing early signs of cognitive decline. One died at aged
50 years of a possible underlying heart condition; 2 died of re-
spiratory diseases with no signs of decline at age 63 years and
73 years, respectively; and for 2 participants the cause of death
was unknown.
Factors Associated With Mortality by Dementia Status
Table 2 shows the Cox regression results for each indepen-
dent factor split by dementia status and the final combined
model for those with dementia. For individuals without a de-
mentiadiagnosis,individualCoxregressionsrevealedthatlate-
onset epilepsy was the only variable associated with mortal-
ity, with a near 10-fold increase in risk. For those with a clinical
diagnosis of dementia, APOE genotype, multimorbidity, early-
onset epilepsy, and dementia medication status were all sig-
nificantly independently associated with mortality, such that
presence of 1 or more APOE ε4 alleles, 2 or more health con-
ditions, or early-onset epilepsy each were associated with in-
creasedmortalityrisk,andtakingantidementiamedicationwas
associated with decreased risk. When entered into a com-
bined model, including all significant factors, APOE geno-
type was the only factor to maintain an association at the

Factors Associated With Age at Dementia Diagnosis
Sex (women diagnosed earlier), APOE genotype, multimor-

be independently associated with age at dementia diagnosis.
All but sex remained significantly associated in the
combined model (Table 3, with hazard functions in Figure 2).
Increased risk for developing dementia was seen for those
carrying at least 1 APOE ε4 allele (5-fold increase compared
with 2 APOE ε3 alleles), having 2 or more comorbid health con-
ditions (2-fold increase), and having early-onset epilepsy (near
4-fold increase). Those living with family were diagnosed at
an earlier age. In this sample, carrying an APOE ε2 allele was

Discussion
This study examined the effect of dementia diagnosis on mor-
tality in a representative cohort of adults with DS in England.
Dementia was the proximate cause of death in 70% of our
sample overall: 10 men (62.5%) and 9 women (81.8%) had de-
mentia when they died. At least 3 of 8 participants who died
without a dementia diagnosis showed signs of cognitive de-
clineand/orseizures;thus,thisproportionmaybeevenhigher.
These results compare strikingly with mortality statistics
for England and Wales: dementia of any subtype is men-
tionedin17.5%ofdeathcertificatesforthose65yearsandolder;
and older than 80 years, dementia is the leading cause of death
for 14% and 22% of male and female deaths respectively.19,20
In our sample, crude mortality was increased 5-fold for those
with dementia (CMR with dementia, 1191.85 deaths per 10 000
person-years vs CMR without dementia, 232.22 deaths per
10 000 person-years), giving a similar mortality rate for those
with dementia to that reported for AD dementia in the non-DS
population (1070 deaths per 10 000 person-years).21
In our sample, we found no clear differences in mortality
between men and women, matching previous work showing
similaragesatdeathinmenandwomenwithDS.2Womenwere
diagnosed as having dementia up to 3 years earlier than men.
This pattern has been previously reported in adults with DS

sexwasconsideredasanindependentfactor.Inthefinalmodel,
including APOE genotype, multimorbidity, living situation and
early-onset epilepsy, the influence of sex on dementia diag-
nosis was lost.
Seizures are a common feature of AD in those with and
without DS, occurring in a quarter of patients without DS with
AD22 and 40% of patients with DS and AD.14 However, late-
onset epilepsy was also noted in 7 people (4.8%) without a
dementia diagnosis in our study, increasing mortality risk 10-
fold. For those without dementia, late-onset epilepsy was the
only factor associated with mortality. This raises the ques-
tion of whether seizures can begin in the absence of other

 features of dementia in individuals with DS or whether these
7 individuals had significant AD pathology and neurological
symptoms but had yet to receive a formal dementia diagno-
sis. While preexisting ID can make it challenging for decline
to be identified in this population, detailed clinical assess-
ments have been found to be robust and valid for those with
DS,17 and a range of sensitive cognitive batteries have been de-
veloped within the past 10 years.16,23-25 Baseline assessments
completed in early adulthood can help to serve as each indi-
vidual’
s reference point, allowing decline to be identified on
an individual level in this highly variable population.26
For people with DS and dementia, carrying at least 1 APOE
ε4 allele was associated with increased mortality risk 7-fold.
These results suggest people with DS may be particularly vul-
nerabletotheeffectsofAPOEε4becauseAPOEε4carrierswith
AD in the non-DS population show little difference to noncar-
riers with AD in disease progression or mortality.27,28 Our data
confirm some of the other associations with mortality previ-
ouslyobserved,includingthedeleteriouseffectofepilepsyand
the potentially beneficial effect of currently available medica-
tionsuchasacetyl-cholineesteraseinhibitors.29However,other
associationswerenotobserved:antipsychoticshavebeenfound
to double mortality risk in people with dementia in the non-DS
population,30 yet in our sample we did not find a statistically
significant association between antipsychotic use and death in
those with or without dementia. Similarly, obesity had no dis-
cernibleassociationwithdeathordementiaonsetinthisstudy.
Our data are from a comparatively small group, with a maxi-
mumfollow-uptimeof65months.Furtherresearchusinglarger

whetherthesereflectgenuinedifferencesinriskintheDSpopu-
lation or simply reflect a lack of power for identifying multiple
risk factors in this sample.
APOE ε4 genotype, early-onset epilepsy, multimorbidity,
and living with family were all associated with earlier demen-
tia diagnoses. Previous studies have shown that APOE geno-
type influences dementia risk in DS in much the same way as
in the non-DS population. Similarly, epilepsy has been found
toincreaseriskofADinthegeneralpopulation,withadultswith
epilepsy younger than 65 years nearly 40 times more likely and
those older than 65 years nearly 7 times more likely to be diag-
nosed as having AD.31 Aside from known vascular risk factors,

 in dementia risk.32 A further explanation could be that in-
creasedinteractionwithhealthcareservicesforthosewithmul-
tiple health conditions and increased awareness of change for
those living with family may make these groups more likely to
receiveadementiaassessmentandsubsequentdiagnosisrather
than increasing risk of dementia per se.
Because multimorbidity was associated with increased
dementia risk and mortality in those who received dementia
diagnoses, our results also highlight the need for effective
recognition and treatment of common health comorbidities
in DS. Individuals with ID experience significant health
inequalities,33 and evidence suggests that incentivizing gen-
eral practitioners to offer comprehensive ID health checks
increases the number of specific health assessments com-
pleted and may thus reduce said health inequalities.34 Given
that several of the comorbidities we included are treatable,
such health checks could have longer-term positive effects
than have previously been assessed.
Limitations
Our data were collected as part of a prospective, longitudinal
study of adults with DS, providing extensive health informa-
tion and cognitive assessments for the individuals. While our
sample is large for a study of such detail, we acknowledge that
the numbers included are relatively small for an epidemio-
logic study. Health data were collected via informant report,
which may be influenced by reporter bias, their memory, and
the relationship between the informer and the individual with
Down syndrome.
Conclusions
Our study shows that most adults with DS now have demen-
tia when they die and are affected by some of the same fac-
tors associated with dementia (such as APOE genotype) as we
see in the non-DS population. These findings support the ur-
gent need for clinical trials of treatments to prevent or delay
dementia in those with DS. Finally, we hope that our findings
can improve clinical care by identifying factors associated with
increased risk for dementia and mortality risk in this popula-
tion, suggesting the potentially beneficial effects of existing
medication options and helping clinicians provide prognos-
tic information for their patients with DS.
