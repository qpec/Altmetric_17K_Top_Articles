Background: Nutrition is often overlooked in everyday health care despite the
definitive connection between diet and health. Many practicing physicians and
medical students feel unqualified to discuss specific dietary recommendations with
patients, which may be attributed to inadequate nutrition education during medical
school.
Objective: To assess the nutrition knowledge of osteopathic medical students and
their attitudes regarding the importance of nutrition counseling in their future role
as practicing physicians.
Methods: Using a descriptive, cross-sectional study design, the authors evaluated
first- and second-year osteopathic medical students’ nutrition knowledge and atti-
tudes toward nutrition counseling. A questionnaire that assessed attitudes toward
nutrition counseling and a quiz that tested nutrition knowledge were used.
Results: A total of 257 first-year (n=139) and second-year (n=118) medical students
(mean [SD] age, 24.8 [3.4] years; 52.8% female and 78.2% white) completed the
quiz and survey. The average score of the nutrition knowledge quiz was 69.5%,
with 130 participants (50.6%) scoring below the school’s passing rate of 72.5%.
Second-year students performed better than first-year students on the quiz (mean,
74.2% vs 65.9%; t=−5.17; P<.001). The majority of participants (143 [55.6%])
felt comfortable counseling patients on nutrition recommendations; however, only
30 (11.9%) were aware of the current dietary reference intakes. Qualitatively, most
participants acknowledged the importance of providing patient education, promoting
overall health and wellness, and preventing and treating disease.
Conclusion: The majority of participants felt comfortable counseling future patients
on nutrition recommendations; however, most participants lacked knowledge of
dietary reference intakes and medical nutrition therapy. Because half of osteopathic
medical students typically enter primary care, students and their future paitents
would benefit from the integration of more nutrition education in medical school.

T
he foundation for a health-promoting lifestyle is a balanced diet with a variety of
nutrient-dense foods and beverages consumed in moderation along with ample
physical activity.1,2 Despite the importance of eating a well-balanced diet,
most people in the United States are not eating a diet with sufficient or quality proportion

 of nutrients.3 Many are overconsuming total kilocal-
ories, added sugars, and saturated fats while undercon-
suming several vitamins and minerals.3 Furthermore,
the estimated proportion of adults in the United States
with a poor-quality diet is 45.6%, and less than 10%
of adults are meeting the recommended consumption
of fruits and vegetables.4 These imbalances are a
major cause for concern because poor dietary habits
can lead to overweight and obesity and, in turn,
chronic disease or poor management of existing
diseases.5
Currently, more than one-third of adults in the United
States are classified as obese, and obesity-related dis-
eases and conditions (eg, coronary artery disease,
stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, some cancers) contrib-
ute between $147 and $210 billion in health care costs
per year.6,7 These obesity-related diseases and condi-
tions could be reduced and better managed with patient
education on proper nutrition, and health care profes-
sionals at all levels should be equipped to provide this
education. The member of the health care team most
proficient in medical nutrition therapy or nutrition edu-
cation and counseling is the registered dietitian (RD) or
registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN).1 Ideally, physi-
cians would refer patients in need of nutrition counsel-
ing to RDs/RDNs. However, most patients are not
referred because of countless physician barriers, includ-
ing time, lack of insurance coverage, finances, and con-
fidence in a patient’s willingness to change behaviors.8
For this reason, primary care physicians (PCPs) are
often the sole source of nutrition education or nutrition
counseling.9 A specific goal of Healthy People 2020 is
to increase the proportion of patient-physician appoint-
ments dedicated to counseling or education related to
nutrition or weight.10 Although physicians are more
knowledgeable in the management of disease, several
studies suggest that many practicing physicians as well
as medical students feel ill-prepared to discuss specific
dietary recommendations with patients.9,11-16
Physicians’ and medical students’ perceived lack of
nutrition proficiency may be attributed to inadequate
nutrition education during medical school. Previous
research on allopathic and osteopathic medical students
found that medical schools do not provide the recom-
mended number of hours of nutrition education.17,18
However, to our knowledge, osteopathic medical stu-
dents have not been studied extensively with respect to
nutrition knowledge and attitudes toward nutrition
counseling. Furthermore, the tenets of osteopathic
medicine emphasize the body’s ability to self-regulate,
self-heal, and maintain health.19 Thus, nutrition educa-
tion aligns both with osteopathic philosophy and the
focus of primary care on prevention and wellness. For
these reasons, adequate nutrition knowledge is vital in
the osteopathic student population.
The preclinical curriculum at the Ohio University
Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine (OU-HCOM)
consists of medical knowledge and clinical skills. The
medical knowledge courses are divided into blocks of
curricular content (eg, cardiovascular), which are further
segmented into weekly modules identified by theme or
clinical presentation (eg, hypertension). Nutrition-based
lectures are integrated into these blocks throughout the
first 2 years of medical education. Students must earn a
score of 72.5% or higher to pass each block. The
purpose of this study was to assess the nutrition knowl-
edge and the attitudes of preclinical (first- and second-
year) osteopathic medical students toward nutrition coun-
seling in their future role as practicing physicians.
Methods
The University Office of Research Compliance at
OU-HCOM approved the protocol and all recruitment
procedures and materials.
Participants
An e-mail invitation was sent by the study investigator
(E.A.B.) via school-maintained listservs to first- and
second-year osteopathic medical students currently
enrolled at the main campus (Athens) and 2 distance
campuses (Dublin and Cleveland). Students were
informed that they would receive a $15.00 gift card as
compensation for participating in the study, which

 involved completing a nutrition quiz and a survey. The
survey was sent on January 5, 2016, and a reminder
email was sent on January 12, 2016. Participation in
the study was voluntary.
Measures
Participants completed a short demographic form, a
nutrition quiz, and a survey with 6 items that pertained
to their beliefs about PCPs’ role in nutrition counseling,
awareness of dietary reference intakes (DRIs), comfort
level with nutrition counseling and designing nutrition
plans, understanding the role of RD/RDNs on the
health care team, and perceived importance of nutrition
education in medical school.
The Nutrition Knowledge Quiz, a 20-item multiple
choice quiz adapted from a 40-item multiple choice
quiz created to measure medical interns’ nutrition
knowledge.16 Although the quiz is not validated, it
was created using questions from a reliable nutrition
textbook and has been used in a previous study that
assessed allopathic medical students’ nutrition knowl-
edge. Questions assessed general nutrition knowledge
and specific nutrition interventions, including obesity,
endocrine nutrition, cardiovascular nutrition, and basic
nutrient information. These questions were developed
specifically for use in this study and consisted of
closed-response and open-ended response options.
Participants completed the survey via the online
questionnaire service Qualtrics. To consent, participants
clicked a radio button indicating “Yes, I consent to par-
ticipate in this study. I may withdraw my participation at
any time.” To decline, participants clicked a radio
button indicating “I decline to participate.” To avoid
coercion, the online screen to the survey and the
informed consent document both specified the volun-
tary nature of participation. The informed consent docu-
ment explicitly informed potential participants that their
responses had no bearing on academic performance.
Participants with questions about the study were direc-
ted to e-mail or telephone the research investigators.
Completion of the survey took approximately 30
minutes. Qualtrics permitted the research team to down-
load participants’ survey responses into a spreadsheet
without including identifying information (eg, name,
e-mail address) to ensure anonymity at the level of data.
Data Analysis
Basic sociodemographic characteristics of participants
were assessed using descriptive statistics. Frequencies
of individual question responses were also calculated.
Nutrition quiz scores were calculated by summing the
number of correct responses divided by total questions
multiplied by 100 to yield a percentage score.
Independent sample t tests were conducted to examine
differences in nutrition quiz scores by year in medical
school, sex, awareness of DRIs, and comfort level
with nutrition counseling and designing nutrition
plans. χ2 tests were conducted to examine differences
in comfort level with nutrition counseling and design-
ing nutrition plans by sex and year in medical school.
For analysis, the variables for comfort level with nutri-
tion counseling and designing nutrition plans were
dichotomized, with 1 including “very comfortable”
and “somewhat comfortable” responses and 0 consist-
ing of “not too comfortable” and “not at all comfort-
able” responses. Statistical significance was defined as
P<.05. All analyses were conducted with SPSS statis-
tical software version 23.0 (IBM).
The open-ended short-answer responses were ana-
lyzed using standard qualitative techniques. Specifically,
2 experienced researchers (E.J.H., E.A.B.) performed
content analysis20 by independently marking and cat-
egorizing key words, phrases, and texts to identify codes
that described the perceived importance of nutrition edu-
cation in medical school. All short-answer responses
were coded and reviewed to establish intercoder reliabil-
ity.21 Qualitative counts were then provided to group the
findings.
Results
Of the 424 osteopathic medical students enrolled at
OU-HCOM’s 3 campuses, 257 (60.6%) completed the
survey and quiz. Six participants chose not to disclose

 their campus, and not all students completed every
question. One hundred thirty-nine participants were
first-year students, and 118 were second-year students.
One hundred thirty-four (52.8%) were women, and
107 (42.5%) planned to pursue a career in primary
care. Demographic data are presented in Table 1.
The average score on the nutrition knowledge quiz
was 69.5%, with 130 participants (50.6%) scoring
below the school’s passing rate of 72.5%. No significant
differences were observed between male and female stu-
dents by average quiz score (mean, 68.7% vs 70.0%;
t=0.769; P=.442) or individual quiz questions (Table 2).
However, second-year students performed better on the
quiz compared with first-year students (mean, 74.2% vs
65.9%; t=−5.17; P<.001; Table 2). Specifically, second-
year students were more likely than first-year students to
understand energy density (73 [65.2%] vs 57 [41.0%],
respectively; χ2=19.3; P<.001), energy balance (33
[29.5%] vs 26 [18.7%], respectively; χ2=4.9; P=.027),
types of fatty acids (87 [77.7%] vs 90 [64.7%], respect-
ively; χ2=8.7; P<.001), gastroesophageal reflux (94
[83.9%] vs 95 [68.3%], respectively; χ2=15.1; P<.001),
risk for insulin resistance (79 [70.5%] vs 82 [59.0%],
respectively; χ2=5.9; P=.015), and medical nutrition
therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (102 [91.1%] vs 118
[84.9%], respectively; χ2=11.5; P<.001). First-year stu-
dents performed better than second-year students on one
question about the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension) diet (110 [79.1%] vs 69 [61.6%]; χ2=7.9],
respectively; P=.005). Questions in which both first- and
second-year students performed below the school
passing rate included questions about energy density,
energy balance, cholesterol guidelines, medical nutrition
therapy to lower serum cholesterol, and insulin resistance.
One hundred seventy-one participants (68%) felt that
nutrition counseling and meal planning were the
responsibility of the PCP. However, only 30 partici-
pants (11.9%) were aware of the current DRIs, which
denote the most current scientific knowledge of a
healthy person’s different nutrient needs. First-year
medical students were more likely to be aware of DRIs
compared with second-year students (χ2=5.7; P=.017).
Awareness of DRIs did not differ by sex (χ2=1.2;
P=.270). Furthermore, participants’ awareness of DRIs
or lack thereof was not associated with scores on the
nutrition knowledge quiz (mean, 70.7% vs 69.3%,
respectively; t=0.53; P=.594). Despite the limited
awareness about DRIs, 143 students (55.6%) felt at
least somewhat comfortable counseling future patients
on nutrition recommendations, and 86 (34.2%) felt at
least somewhat comfortable designing a nutrition plan
for a patient. Independent sample t tests showed that
when comparing average nutrition quiz scores, partici-
pants who felt at least somewhat comfortable counsel-
ing future patients on nutrition recommendations
scored higher on the quiz compared with those who
did not feel comfortable (mean, 72.2% vs 68.0%,
respectively; t=2.43; P=.016). Of importance, partici-
pants in all comfort level groups scored below the
school’s passing grade of 72.5%. Comfort level with
nutrition counseling and designing meal plans did not
differ by year in medical school (nutrition counseling:
χ2=0.9;
P=.816;
designing
meal
plans:
χ2=3.9;
P=.264) or sex (nutrition counseling: χ2=4.5; P=.216;
designing meal plans: χ2=3.5; P=.325).
One hundred thirty-two participants (54%) reported
knowing the role of an RD/RDN, but qualitatively,
they did not fully understand the RD/RDN’s role on
the health care team. Of these 132 participants, 128
(97.0% response rate of sample) provided written
descriptions of this role. The majority of participants
(111 [86.7%]) described only 1 aspect of an RD/
RDN’s role, and 17 participants (13.3%) described
more than 1 aspect (patient assessment, n=58; nutrition
education, n=55; meal planning, n=33; promoting well-
ness through community outreach, n=1; and staying up
to date with research and guidelines, n=1).
Participants who completed the short answer to the
question “Do you know the role of a registered dietitian?
If yes, please explain” did not differ by age, sex, race,
community, or year in medical school compared with
participants who did not complete the question.
One hundred sixty-six participants (68%) rated nutri-
tion education as very important in medical school.

 Qualitatively, 201 participants (78.2% response rate of
sample) noted the importance of nutrition education as
a means to provide patient education (n=41), promote
overall health and wellness (n=68), prevent disease
(n=31), and manage disease (n=61). Comments
included the following:
As a physician, you are the person that people will go to for
information on nutrition first. The likelihood that a person
will see a nutritionist before asking their PCP questions
is minimal. It is important that the physician knows what
they are talking about and can provide help.
It is the basis of our osteopathic education to get the body
in the most prime shape to fix/preserve itself and nutrition
is a large part of that.
I think nutrition education needs to be much more valued in
medical school because of where our country is in terms of
morbidity and mortality, it comes down to chronic disease
conditions that can be prevented with lifestyle.

 Nutrition is the most basic form of medical therapy.
Improper nutrition accounts for many of the preventable
diseases we will encounter regularly in our practice.
Participants who completed the short answer to the ques-
tion “How important is nutrition education in medical
school? Please explain.” did not differ by age, sex, race,
community, or year in medical school compared with
participants who did not complete the question. Five par-
ticipants also commented that nutrition was not covered
on board examinations despite its importance in health
and well-being. For example, a participant wrote: “In
reality, it is very important. But I am more worried
about learning material that will be tested on boards.”
Discussion
This study found that 130 participants did not receive a
passing nutrition quiz grade. Second-year students
performed better on the quiz compared with first-year
students; however, both classes performed below the
school’s passing rate on questions about energy
density, energy balance, cholesterol guidelines, and
medical nutrition therapy to lower serum cholesterol
level. These findings suggest that topics, including
dietary recommendation categories, energy density,
energy balance, and dietary fat, may need to be added
to the preclinical curriculum. The majority of partici-
pants, who were preclinical osteopathic medical stu-
dents,
recognized
the
importance
of
nutrition
education. Qualitatively, most participants valued nutri-
tion education in medical school, particularly for pro-
viding patient education, promoting overall health and
wellness, preventing disease, and managing disease.
Furthermore, the majority of participants reported
feeling “very or somewhat comfortable” counseling
patients on nutrition recommendations. Despite the per-
ceived importance of nutrition education and comfort
level with counseling patients, the vast majority of par-
ticipants lacked knowledge about DRIs
In 2012, the National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey reported more than 506 million visits to PCPs
in the United States.22 More than 60 million office
visits were to osteopathic physicians.22 Osteopathic
medicine embraces a holistic approach to medicine and
recognizes the importance of nutrition in preventive
and therapeutic medicine. For this reason, PCPs—in
particular, osteopathic PCPs—are well positioned to
play a key role in promoting healthy eating.23 The US
Preventive Services Task Force recommends that PCPs
provide nutrition counseling as part of routine prevent-
ive health care.24 However, a study published in 2011
found that less than 50% of PCPs surveyed reported
always discussing diet with their patients.25 Another
study found that although a majority of PCPs thought
that nutrition should be part of every primary care visit,
they reported not having adequate nutrition training to
counsel patients.16 For these reasons, adequate nutrition
education is especially important in medical school.
The current study builds on previous work and con-
firms
findings
from
allopathic
medical
schools
showing that nutrition education is lacking. In a 2008
study conducted with incoming and current medical
interns, the average score on a nutrition knowledge
quiz was a 66%, indicating major gaps in basic nutri-
tion concepts.16 In the current study, the level of knowl-
edge reflected by students in response to several
nutrition quiz questions did not follow the expectations
set
by
the
tenets
of
osteopathic
medicine.19
Specifically, nonmedication methods should be consid-
ered first when treating patients with conditions such as
hypertension and high cholesterol. However, a large
percentage of participants did not know dietary
approaches to managing these conditions. Second-year
students performed slightly better on the nutrition quiz
compared with first-year students. One possible explan-
ation for this finding is that second-year students have
an additional year of education and training in medical
knowledge, which may have improved their quiz scores.
The findings of the current study are in accord with a
study by Smith et al.26 which surveyed PCP residents on
their preparedness to provide obesity and nutrition coun-
seling. The study concluded that PCP residents have
room for improvement with regard to assessment and
management methods for obesity and nutrition.26

 However, unlike other studies, the current study showed
that the majority of participants felt comfortable offer-
ing nutrition counseling despite gaps in their nutrition
knowledge. Previous research identified insufficient
training and lack of counseling skills as barriers to pro-
viding
nutrition
education
and
counseling
to
patients.14,16 In the current study, participants’ confi-
dence to discuss general nutrition guidelines without
knowledge of DRIs is concerning. Importantly, research
has shown that physicians who are overly confident are

 less likely to seek additional resources and more likely
to misdiagnose their patients’ conditions.27 Likewise,
medical students who are overly confident in their
general nutrition knowledge but lack knowledge of
important reference values, such as the DRIs, may not
attempt to further understand or explore these important
recommendations in treating future patients. The DRIs
for nutrient and energy intake vary dramatically by age,
sex, and circumstance (eg, lactation, pregnancy,
disease).28 Medical students need to acknowledge that
a one-size-fits-all recommendation for nutrients is not
appropriate, and DRIs are updated routinely as new
research is available. Therefore, an understanding of
these recommendations is critical to the future physician
providing dietary advice. Furthermore, medical students
and practicing physicians should be aware of online
interactive tools (eg, https://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/
interactiveDRI/) to quickly calculate the DRIs for
patients. These resources may be underused by those
overly confident in their nutrition knowledge and coun-
seling skills.
Many studies have examined the amount and quality
of nutrition education in medical education programs.
A survey conducted in 1985 by the National Academy
of Science found that nutrition education was inad-
equate in allopathic medical schools, prompting the
organization to recommend a minimum of 25 hours of
nutrition instruction.29 However, a study conducted in
2006 showed that the average number of nutrition
instruction hours in medical schools fell below the
recommended 25 hours and was often a part of
another course.17 With regard to osteopathic medical
schools, a 2015 study indicated that required nutrition
education averaged only 17 hours and that the nutrition
instruction was often a part of an integrated course
rather than a course dedicated to nutrition education.18
A 2016 study assessing nutrition training in residency
programs showed that only 26.4% of programs have a
formal nutrition course, and 13.9% report no form of
nutrition training.30 Moreover, the format of nutrition
education was reported to vary significantly from a
single 45-minute lecture to multiple 1-hour sessions,
which could include lectures, informal rounds, confer-
ences, and web-based learning programs. These findings
show multiple shortcomings in nutrition education at
medical schools, which, in turn, can have large health
ramifications if physicians are not adequately trained to
educate and counsel patients on nutrition. The qualitative
responses from participants in the current study demon-
strate that students understand the importance of having
nutrition education in medical school with regard to pre-
ventive and therapeutic medicine; thus, more nutrition
training and education is necessary.
At least 1 nutrition lecture should be included in each
education block because every organ system benefits
from proper nutrition, and every disease associated
with the organ system has specific dietary needs. To
encourage nutrition education in medical schools, the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute created a
Nutrition Academic Award with a grant to support the
growth and enhancement of nutrition education for
medical students, residents, and practicing physicians.31
However, the creation of the award has had little impact
on increasing nutrition education in medical schools.31
Of the 141 accredited allopathic medical schools and
31 accredited osteopathic medical schools, only 21
medical schools have been awarded the Nutrition
Academic Award.32 Another opportunity for improving
nutrition education in medical school is to require stu-
dents to shadow an RD/RDN to better understand their
role in the health care team. More than half of the parti-
cipants in the current study reported knowing the role
of RDs/RDNs; however, none of the students accur-
ately described the role in overall patient care.
Limitations
Study limitations include homogeneity of the study
sample from 1 osteopathic medical school in a
Midwestern state, the cross-sectional study design, and
participants’ self-reported data. Therefore, the ability
to generalize the findings to all osteopathic medical
schools is limited. However, it should be noted that
the 3 campuses reside in very different geographical
regions across the state—rural, suburban, and urban—

 which may increase the generalizability of the findings.
Furthermore, only students who were enrolled in pre-
clinical education were included in the study; medical
students in clinical education were excluded because
clinical exposure to nutrition education varies by rota-
tion site and preceptor. Moreover, only 59.6% of the
first- and second-year students enrolled at the school
completed the survey. The participating students who
volunteered may have been more willing or motivated
to answer questions about nutrition compared with the
students who did not participate. For these reasons, the
self-reported findings are susceptible to selection bias.
No researchers were present when potential participants
decided to participate or decline, and thus they may
have felt less pressure than in a face-to-face consent
process. Future research with a larger, more heteroge-
neous sample should include medical students enrolled
in preclinical and clinical education as well as
students from multiple osteopathic medical schools.
Longitudinal assessment by year of medical school is
needed to determine whether nutrition knowledge and
attitudes toward nutrition counseling change between
the preclinical and clinical years.
Conclusion
Although students expressed the importance of nutri-
tion education in medical school, and many felt com-
fortable counseling future patients on nutrition, most
students lacked knowledge of DRIs and other nutrition
knowledge. To address the growing rate of obesity and
obesity-related chronic diseases in the United States,
osteopathic medical students would benefit from the
integration of more nutrition education in the curricu-
lum. The NAS recommends a minimum of 25 hours
of nutrition education; however, this guideline is not
being met at most allopathic and osteopathic medical
schools. Incorporating nutrition-related competencies
as well as including nutrition questions on board certifi-
cation examinations may help ensure that schools
adhere to the minimum number of hours of nutrition
education.
