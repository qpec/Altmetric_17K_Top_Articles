Abstract 
47 
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is challenging condition to manage for a variety of physiological and behavioural 
48 
reasons. Regular exercise is important, however management of the different forms of activity is a 
49 
particular struggle for both the individual with T1D and the health care provider. People with T1D tend 
50 
to be at least as inactive as the general population, with a large percentage of individuals not 
51 
maintaining a healthy body mass nor achieving the minimum number of minutes per week of moderate-
52 
to-vigorous aerobic activity. Regular exercise can improve health and well-being and can help individuals 
53 
to achieve their lipid, body composition, fitness and glycaemic goals. However, several additional 
54 
barriers to exercise may exist for the person with diabetes including fear of hypoglycaemia, loss of 
55 
glycaemic control, and inadequate knowledge around exercise management. This review provides an up 
56 
to date consensus on exercise management for individuals with T1D who exercise regularly, including 
57 
glucose targets for safe and effective exercise, and nutritional and insulin dose adjustments to protect 
58 
against exercise-related glucose excursions.

Introduction 
60 
Despite tremendous advances since the discovery of insulin almost 100 years ago, type 1 
61 
diabetes (T1D) remains a challenging disease to manage (1,2). A majority of patients living with T1D are 
62 
not at a healthy body weight (~60% are overweight or obese), suffer from hypertension (~40%) and/or 
63 
dyslipidaemia (~60%) (3) and are not engaging enough regular physical activity (4). Regular exercise 
64 
helps patient achieve a number of goals. It improves the cardiovascular disease risk profile in paediatric 
65 
patients (5) and reduces HbA1c (-0.3%) in that particular segment of the patient population (6). Body 
66 
composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, endothelial function and blood lipid profile (i.e. triglycerides, 
67 
total cholesterol) all improve with regular physical activity in children and young people with T1D (7). 
68 
These cardiometabolic improvements are all important, given that cardiovascular disease is the leading 
69 
cause of morbidity and mortality in persons with T1D (8). In adults, both retinopathy and 
70 
microalbuminuria are less common in those who are more physically active (9). Active adults with T1D 
71 
tend to have better chance of achieving target HbA1c levels, blood pressure levels and a healthier body 
72 
mass index when compared to inactive patients (3). Regular exercise also lowers total daily insulin needs 
73 
(10). Having a high exercise capacity in adulthood with T1D is associated with less risk for coronary 
74 
artery disease, myocardial ischaemia and stroke if you have diabetes or not (11). In a large cross 
75 
sectional study of 18,028 adults with T1D, patients who fall in the most active category of physical 
76 
activity levels (exercising two or more times per week) had better HbA1c levels, a more favourable body 
77 
mass index, less dyslipidaemia, hypertension and fewer diabetes-related complications (retinopathy, 
78 
microalbuminuria), compared to those who were less habitually active (3). In general, patients with T1D 
79 
who are more active tend to have less diabetic ketoacidosis and less risk for developing severe 
80 
hypoglycaemia with coma (3), except for with older women where this latter relationship is reversed; 
81 
those most active have higher rates of severe hypoglycaemia (with coma) when compared with those 
82 
who are inactive (3). However, several barriers may exist for exercise including: a fear of hypoglycaemia; 
83 
a loss of glycaemic control, lack of time; access to facilities; lack of motivation; issues around body image 
84 
and a general lack of knowledge around exercise management (12–14). 
85 
The physical activity prescription for all adults living with diabetes, including those living with 
86 
T1D, is 150 minutes of accumulated physical activity each week, with no more than 2 days in a row with 
87 
no activity. Resistance exercise is also recommended two to three times a week. Getting this much 
88 
exercise is difficult for a large majority of patients; with less than 20% of patients performing aerobic 
89 
exercise more than two times per week and 60% of the patient population performing no structured 
90 
exercise at all (3).  For children and adolescent, at least 60 minutes of physical activity should be 
91 
performed per day (15). Physical inactivity and prolonged sitting times increase gradually with age and 
92 
are linked to high HbA1c levels in youth with T1D (16) and inactivity appears to be more common in 
93 
females than in males (3).  
94 
Regular exercise should be encouraged and supported by health care professionals (HCPs), for a 
95 
number of reasons, but primarily because the overall cardiometabolic benefits outweigh the immediate 
96 
risks if certain precautions are made. In this review, the basic categories of exercise are described from a 
97 
physiological perspective as are the starting points for nutritional and insulin dose adjustments to keep 
98 
patients in a targeted glycaemic range. This review summarizes our consensus on the available 
99 
 4 
 
strategies that help incorporate exercise safely into the daily T1D management plan for those adults 
100 
who are regularly engaging in exercise, sport and/or competitive events. It is hoped that these new 
101 
guidelines for exercise management will improve patient control and engage more individuals with T1D 
102 
to be more physically active.

Search strategy and selection criteria 
105 
We searched PubMed.gov and other relevant biomedical databases for articles pertaining to 
106 
‘type 1 diabetes’ OR ‘insulin-dependent diabetes AND ‘exercise’ OR ‘physical activity’; published 
107 
between 01/1990 to 07/2016 and filtered for human and restricted to English publications. Additional 
108 
searches using the search terms ‘nutrition’ OR ‘dietary carbohydrate’ OR ‘dietary protein’ OR ‘glycemic 
109 
index’ OR ‘hypoglycaemia’ OR ‘energy expenditure OR ‘glycemic control’ OR ‘management’ OR 
110 
‘hypoglycemia’ OR ‘hyperglycemia’ OR ‘prevention & control’ were conducted for various subtopics 
111 
within this review.

113 
Physiology of Physical Activity and Exercise 
114 
Modalities of exercise 
115 
Understanding the metabolic and neuroendocrine responses to the various types of exercise undertaken 
116 
by people with T1D is critical for determining appropriate nutritional and insulin management 
117 
strategies. Exercise is generally classified as aerobic or anaerobic, depending on the predominant energy 
118 
systems used to support the activity, although a majority of exercise activities include a mix of energy 
119 
systems. Aerobic exercise involves repeated and continuous movement of large muscle groups (e.g. 
120 
walking, cycling, jogging, and swimming) that rely primarily on aerobic energy-producing systems. 
121 
Resistance (strength) training is a type of exercise using free weights, weight machines, body weight, or 
122 
elastic resistance bands that rely primarily on anaerobic energy-producing systems. High intensity 
123 
interval training (HIIT), involves alternating between brief periods of vigorous exercise and recovery 
124 
periods at low-to-moderate intensity (e.g., from 20 seconds to 4 minute intervals of exercise and rest, 
125 
for up to ~10 cycles) (17). Both aerobic and resistance type activities are recommended for a majority of 
126 
people living with diabetes (15,18) and recent guidelines also now incorporate HIIT as a training 
127 
modality with established benefits for individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes (18). In some 
128 
studies, HIIT has been shown to be more effective than continuous aerobic training in improving 
129 
cardiovascular fitness and various parameters related to glucose metabolism including insulin sensitivity 
130 
and glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (19). At present, it is unclear what form(s) of exercise are best 
131 
for improving cardiometabolic control in type 1 diabetes (20). 
132 
Neuroendocrine and metabolic responses to exercise 
133 
Individuals without diabetes 
134 
 5 
 
The metabolic responses to different forms of exercise are distinct. However, in almost all forms of 
135 
exercise, no matter the intensity or duration, blood glucose concentrations are normally held within a 
136 
tight range (4-6 mmol/l). During aerobic exercise, insulin secretion drops and glucagon secretion rises in 
137 
the portal vein to facilitate glucose release from the liver to match the rate of glucose uptake into the 
138 
working muscles (21). Exercise can increase glucose uptake into muscle by up to 50-fold; a phenomenon 
139 
independent of insulin signalling (22), so the drop in insulin in the circulation does not limit glucose 
140 
provision to the working body. Although the main determinant of glucose production for aerobic 
141 
exercise is a rise in glucagon levels, there is also neural control of glucose release and other 
142 
counterregulatory hormones play a supportive role (23). With increased exercise duration, there is 
143 
reduced reliance on muscle glycogen as fuel and a greater reliance on lipid oxidation and plasma-derived 
144 
glucose (24). If insulin levels do not fall during aerobic exercise, the rise in counterregulatory hormones 
145 
is less effective in promoting hepatic glucose production (21).  
146 
As the intensity of exercise increases above ~50-60% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), 
147 
fat oxidation decreases, particularly in those who are untrained, and CHO are the preferred fuel (25). 
148 
Prolonged high-intensity exercise is supported by both muscle glycogen and blood glucose utilization 
149 
with minimal contributions from lipid and protein (26). During predominantly anaerobic activities (27) 
150 
and during a HIIT session (28), circulating insulin concentrations do not drop as markedly as compared to 
151 
purely aerobic activities, in part because the duration of activity is typically shorter. High rates of 
152 
external power output during HIIT increase reliance on muscle phosphagens and glycogen, with lactate 
153 
levels rising markedly in the circulation (28). Insulin levels increase above baseline levels in early 
154 
recovery from a HIIT session to offset the rise in glucose caused by the elevations in counterregulatory 
155 
hormones and other metabolites (27). 
156 
 
157 
Dysglycaemia during exercise in individuals with T1D 
158 
In T1D, the glycaemic responses to exercise are influenced by the location of insulin delivery, the 
159 
amount of insulin in the circulation, the pre exercise blood glucose concentration, the composition of 
160 
the last meal or snack, as well as the intensity and duration of the activity (29) (Figure 1). 
161 
During aerobic exercise, most individuals with T1D have a drop in glycaemia, unless 
162 
carbohydrates (CHO) are ingested, because insulin levels cannot be lowered rapidly enough at the start 
163 
of the activity, and levels may rise in the systemic circulation (30), perhaps because of increased 
164 
subcutaneous adipose tissue blood flow during exercise (31). Even if basal insulin infusion rates are 
165 
halved 60-min before the start of exercise in patients on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), 
166 
circulating free insulin levels do not drop at exercise commencement and levels tend to rise transiently 
167 
during the activity (32). Higher insulin levels in circulation during exercise promotes increased glucose 
168 
disposal relative to hepatic glucose production, and may delay lipolysis, another feature that increases 
169 
the muscles reliance on glucose as a fuel. Hypoglycaemia develops in a majority of patients within ~45 
170 
minutes of activity (33,34). Trained individuals with T1D have greater reductions in blood glucose 
171 
concentrations during aerobic exercise when compared to less fit patients (35), possibly because the 
172 
 6 
 
overall work rate is higher in those more aerobically conditioned. As such, both trained and untrained 
173 
individuals with T1D typically require increased CHO intake, and/or insulin dose reduction, for prolonged 
174 
aerobic exercise (see below). High intensity interval sprint training promotes increased oxidative 
175 
capacity of skeletal muscle in T1D and attenuates the rates of glycogen breakdown (36), which may 
176 
protect against post-exercise hypoglycaemia, at least in theory. Perhaps in line with this, individuals who 
177 
are aerobically conditioned have reduced glucose variability compared to those unconditioned (37). Low 
178 
insulin levels due to aggressive reductions in administration or a skipped insulin dose can cause 
179 
hyperglycaemia prior to and during aerobic exercise (38) and ketosis may develop, even with mild 
180 
activity (39).  
181 
Compared to continuous moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, resistance exercise is associated 
182 
with better glucose stability (40), although it may cause a modest rise in some individuals (41). 
183 
Compared to aerobic exercise, performing a HIIT session attenuates the drop in glycaemia (42), as does 
184 
performing resistance exercise before aerobic exercise (43), possibly because of increases in 
185 
counterregulatory hormones and various metabolites that limit glucose disposal (44). In situations of 
186 
brief and intense anaerobic exercise (e.g. sprinting, weight lifting, some competitive sports) (41,45), or 
187 
during HIIT (28), glucose levels typically rise.  
188 
 
189 
Dysglycaemia post-exercise in individuals with T1D 
190 
Immediately after aerobic exercise, glucose uptake into muscle drops but overall glucose disposal 
191 
is still elevated for hours in recovery to help replenish glycogen stores (46). Hypoglycaemia risk is 
192 
elevated for at least 24 hours in recovery from exercise with the greatest risk for nocturnal 
193 
hypoglycaemia occurring after afternoon activity (47). As mentioned above, weight lifting, sprinting and 
194 
intense aerobic exercise can promote elevations in glycaemia that may last for hours in recovery. 
195 
Although a conservative insulin “correction” post-exercise may be prudent in some situations (48), over-
196 
correction with insulin can promote severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia and death (49). HIIT appears to 
197 
increase risk for nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared to continuous aerobic exercise in some (50), but 
198 
not all (51,52) studies.  
199 
 
200 
Exercise Goals and Glycaemic Targets  
201 
Individuals with T1D should perform exercise for a variety of health reasons. The evidence that 
202 
regular exercise training improves metabolic control in adults with T1D is somewhat limited (20,53), 
203 
although in youth it appears to be helpful (7). Exercise readiness questionnaires for adults with diabetes 
204 
who may be at increased risk for adverse events can be found at eparmedx.com. Patient goals for 
205 
exercise should be considered before making management decisions (e.g. metabolic control and 
206 
prevention of complications, fitness, weight loss, competition/performance). This is a critical element of 
207 
the diabetes management plan. For example, exercise for weight loss requires strategies that focus on 
208 
reducing insulin levels during and after exercise, as opposed to consuming additional CHOs. By contrast, 
209 
 7 
 
if maximising sports and exercise performance is the primary goal, then sport-specific nutritional 
210 
guidance is needed and a modified insulin plan to match increased nutritional requirements should be 
211 
considered (54). For all patients, blood glucose monitoring before, during and after exercise is critical for 
212 
informing strategies and maintaining stable and safe glycaemia. 
213 
The appropriate blood glucose concentration for the start of exercise should be individually 
214 
tailored. Based on consensus, a reasonable starting range for most patients doing aerobic exercise 
215 
lasting up to an hour is between 7-10 mmol/l. This range balances performance considerations against 
216 
hypoglycaemia risk. Higher levels may be acceptable in some situations where added protection against 
217 
hypoglycaemia is needed. Achieving and maintaining circulating glucose in this range is challenging. The 
218 
glycaemic response to exercise is variable and based on several factors including the duration and 
219 
intensity of exercise (44,55), the starting level of glycaemia (34), the individual’s aerobic fitness (35) and 
220 
the amount of insulin in circulation (56,57) (Figure 1). Anaerobic and a HIIT session can be initiated with 
221 
a lower starting glucose level (5-7 mmol/l) since glucose concentrations tend to remain relatively stable, 
222 
fall to a lesser extent compared to continuous aerobic exercise, or rise slightly (Figure 1). Strategies to 
223 
cope with a range of glucose concentrations near the start of exercise are provided in Table 1. If glucose 
224 
level is too high because of insulin omission, risk of ketosis and further hyperglycaemia can occur (39) 
225 
and work effort probably rises. Although it is unclear if there is an optimal glycaemic range for exercise 
226 
performance, clinical experience and limited field study investigation (58) suggest that maintaining a 
227 
concentration between ~6.0-8.0 mmol/l may be ideal.   
228 
 
229 
Contraindications and cautions for exercise 
230 
While few exercise limitations should be placed on patients, some considerations are important:  
231 
A. Ketones 
232 
 Elevated blood ketones (≥1.5 mmol/l) before a bout of exercise should be addressed prior to 
233 
the start of the session via insulin administration and/or CHO feeding (Table 1). The cause of 
234 
elevated ketone levels should be identified (illness, diet manipulation, a recent bout of 
235 
prolonged exercise, insulin omission, etc.). Both prolonged endurance type activities 
236 
(marathons, trekking, etc.) and very low CHO diets can elevate blood ketone levels in 
237 
patients and the HCP should define appropriate levels and provide tailored guidance for 
238 
each individual. Blood ketone levels of ≥ 3.0 mmol/l should be managed immediately by a 
239 
qualified HCP (e.g. emergency department, physician, etc.). 
240 
B. Recent hypoglycaemia 
241 
 Severe hypoglycaemia (defined here as a blood glucose ≤2.8 mmol/l or a hypoglycaemic 
242 
event requiring assistance from another individual) within the previous 24 hours is a 
243 
contraindication to exercise, due to the significant increased risk of a more serious episode 
244 
during the exercise (59). Where minor hypoglycaemia (blood glucose 2.9-3.9 mmol/l, with 
245 
 8 
 
the ability to self-treat) has occurred, the increased risk of a recurrence must be taken into 
246 
account (60). Vigilance around monitoring should be stressed and exercise should be 
247 
avoided if the setting is deemed particularly unsafe (e.g. swimming/trekking alone). 
248 
C. Diabetes-related complications 
249 
 Overall the health benefits of being physically active outweigh the risks of being sedentary 
250 
for people with diabetes. Those with complications can derive numerous health benefits 
251 
from lower intensity physical activities, with little risk for any adverse events (61). In those 
252 
with long-standing disease, or with HbA1c levels well above target, vigorous exercise, heavy 
253 
weight-bearing activities and competitive endurance events are contraindicated, particularly 
254 
if the patient has unstable proliferative retinopathy, severe autonomic dysfunction or renal 
255 
failure (61). 
256 
D. Failure to be prepared for exercise-associated hypoglycaemia 
257 
 In preparation for exercise, individuals with T1D should be aware of their starting glucose 
258 
concentrations, have blood glucose monitoring equipment and snacks to treat 
259 
hypoglycaemia. They should also be advised to wear/carry diabetes identification.  
260 
 
261 
Nutritional Management 
262 
Goals for nutritional management  
263 
Nutritional management for people with T1D should incorporate strategies that optimise 
264 
glycaemic control, while promoting long-term health (62). The main strategies around nutrition for 
265 
exercise and sport discussed in this section are primarily to maximise athletic performance and are 
266 
based largely on studies conducted in highly trained healthy individuals without diabetes (63), with 
267 
limited studies in people with T1D. The application of these strategies must consider the individual’s 
268 
insulin management plan and specific advice targeting nutrition for both athletic performance and 
269 
glycaemic management (see Glycaemic Management section below). A registered dietitian with 
270 
specialist diabetes and sports knowledge is the most qualified to help active people with T1D. 
271 
An individualised meal planning approach is central to improving performance and glycaemic 
272 
outcomes. Daily CHO intake should relate to the fuel cost of training in the athletic subpopulation and 
273 
hypoglycaemia prevention for all active people. Balancing insulin dose to CHO intake during exercise is 
274 
essential. A variety of CHO and insulin adjustment strategies can be used, such as reducing the pre-
275 
exercise bolus insulin dose by 30-50% up to 90 minutes before aerobic exercise (64),  consuming high 
276 
glycaemic index (GI) CHO (30-60g /hour) during sport or replacing CHO post-exercise for anaerobic 
277 
exercise. Personal tolerance of ingested CHO particularly during exercise is a key factor in individualising 
278 
recommendations. The distribution of macronutrient intake over the day should take into account the 
279 
timing of exercise so that liver and muscle glycogen stores are maximised before the activity and 
280 
 9 
 
replenished in early recovery (63). This strategy should include CHO feeding well before exercise (~4 
281 
hours) and early in recovery (63,65). 
282 
 
283 
Daily energy and macronutrient balance  
284 
Athletes with T1D need sufficient energy to meet the demands of their daily activity. These will 
285 
vary with age, sex, body composition and activity type (66). Total energy requirements differ with 
286 
individual aims. Predictive equations can be used to estimate resting energy expenditure (67); however 
287 
they should serve only as a guide as they may over or underestimate actual requirements. An 
288 
appropriate macronutrient balance and micronutrient intake (63), coupled with a glycaemic control 
289 
strategy, is required to maximise performance. The optimal macronutrient distribution will vary 
290 
depending on an individualised assessment and exercise goals. A guide to the distribution of the total 
291 
daily energy intake is 45-65% CHO, 20-35% fat and 10-35% protein, with higher protein intakes indicated 
292 
for individuals wanting to lose weight (68). 
293 
The major nutrients required to fuel performance are CHOs and lipids, while the addition of 
294 
protein is needed to help foster recovery and maintain nitrogen balance (63,69). Protein requirements 
295 
range from 1.2- 1.6 g/kg body weight (BW) /day and will vary with training type and intensity and CHO 
296 
availability (63,70). Higher intakes may be needed for recovery from injury or for individuals on energy 
297 
restricted diets (71) to maintain lean body mass.  
298 
 
299 
CHO needs before, during and after exercise 
300 
Distinction should be made between CHO needs for performance and CHO required for 
301 
hypoglycaemia prevention (Table 2). CHO requirements will alter insulin management strategies and 
302 
vice versa. The majority of studies in T1D investigate the amount and distribution of CHO to prevent 
303 
hypoglycaemia rather than to optimise performance, although the two may be at least partially related 
304 
(34,64,72,73). As an example, although only 15-20 grams/hr of CHO may be required to prevent 
305 
hypoglycaemia in people who reduce their insulin levels in anticipation of exercise; this amount of CHO 
306 
may be insufficient for performance. It has been shown that it is possible to implement larger CHO 
307 
supplementation (up to 75g/hr) for prolonged competition greater than 2.5 hours (marathons and other 
308 
endurance type races) without adversely impacting glycaemia as long as insulin dose is titrated 
309 
appropriately (54). In general, CHO requirements during shorter, intermittent high intensity and 
310 
anaerobic activities can be much less (Table 2). 
311 
 
312 
Nutritional needs for recovery 
313 
Post-exercise nutrition requirements to maximise muscle recovery and muscle protein synthesis 
314 
have been well studied in the athletic population without diabetes (74). For replenishment of glycogen 
315 
 10 
 
content after exercise, CHO intake is essential (63). For athletes with T1D, it is important to ensure rapid 
316 
and adequate replenishment of muscle and liver glycogen stores to help prevent late-onset 
317 
hypoglycaemia. Glycogen replacement strategies may also be important to help prevent euglycaemic 
318 
ketosis in exercise recovery (75). Ingesting protein (~20-30 grams) in addition to CHO in the post-
319 
exercise period is beneficial for muscle protein synthesis, but it does not appear to facilitate glycogen 
320 
replenishment, at least in non-diabetic athletes (63).  
321 
 
322 
Role of high and low GI foods for maintenance of euglycaemia 
323 
 
The GI of a CHO-rich food can be used to assist with the selection of CHO type for exercise; with 
324 
high GI sports drinks and gels providing rapidly released CHO to increase blood glucose levels during 
325 
endurance events and for the treatment of hypoglycaemia. Low GI foods have been suggested pre-
326 
exercise to sustain CHO availability and maintain euglycaemia, while higher GI meals/snacks consumed 
327 
post-exercise may enhance recovery. Low and moderate GI snacks may also be preferred for long 
328 
distance activities (like trekking and long distance cycling) at low to moderate workloads. Low GI CHO 
329 
(isomaltose) consumed 2 hours before a high intensity run showed improved blood glucose responses 
330 
during exercise compared to a high GI CHO (dextrose) (76). A low GI meal and bedtime snack consumed 
331 
after evening exercise prevented postprandial hyperglycaemia compared to a high GI meal and snack, 
332 
with both meal types protective against hypoglycaemia for ~8 hours (77). Protection beyond 8 hours 
333 
with a snack is lost and hypoglycaemia risk remains significant (77).  
334 
 
335 
Fluid Replacement 
336 
Adequate fluid intake before, during and after exercise is necessary to avoid dehydration and for 
337 
optimal performance (65). Water is the most effective drink for low intensity and short duration sports 
338 
(i.e. ≤ ~45 min), as long a glucose levels are at or above target (≥7 mmol/l). Sports beverages containing 
339 
CHO (6-8%) and electrolytes are useful for athletes with T1D in longer duration, higher intensity exercise 
340 
as a hydration and fuel source and to prevent hypoglycaemia (34,78). However, it is important to ensure 
341 
these are not over consumed as this can result in hyperglycaemia. Milk-based drinks containing CHO and 
342 
protein can assist recovery and prevent delayed hypoglycaemia (73).   
343 
 
344 
Low-CHO high-fat diets and exercise 
345 
People with T1D may choose a low-CHO high-fat (LCHF) diet for a variety of reasons. A recent 
346 
review on LCHF diets and sports performance in subjects without T1D concluded that despite increasing 
347 
the muscles’ ability to utilise fat over time, there was no evidence of performance benefits (79). Long-
348 
term studies have yet to be conducted on the health, glycaemia, or performance effects of LCHF diets in 
349 
T1D. A concern with these diets is that they may impair the capacity for high intensity exercise (80).  
350 
 11 
 
Variation in CHO intake (i.e. periodisation throughout the training cycle according to fuel needs 
351 
and performance) has been suggested by some researchers as a way to help promote skeletal muscle 
352 
adaptation to training (81). Additionally, various exercise-nutrient protocols (i.e. training in a fasted 
353 
state or withholding CHO intake at meal before or after exercise) are used to manipulate CHO 
354 
availability. These approaches have not been studied in individuals with T1D where manipulation of 
355 
dietary CHO as part of training presents unique challenges for insulin therapy and requires careful 
356 
glucose monitoring. 
357 
 
358 
Sports nutritional aids and T1D 
359 
The use of ergogenic aids is a widespread performance enhancement strategy used by athletes. 
360 
The evidence for ergogenic aids on performance is limited in athletes with T1D. 
361 
Caffeine intake in athletes without diabetes has shown improvements in endurance capacity 
362 
and power output (82). Caffeine intake (5-6 mg/kg body mass) before exercise attenuates the drop in 
363 
glycaemia during exercise in individuals with T1D but may increase late-onset hypoglycaemia risk (83). 
364 
 
365 
Glycaemic Management Recommendations 
366 
There is high between- and within-patient variability in glucose responses to the various forms 
367 
and intensities of exercise (Figure 1); therefore glycaemic management is based on frequent glucose 
368 
monitoring, adjustments to both basal and/or bolus insulin dosing and the consumption of CHOs during 
369 
and after exercise. These recommendations are intended to serve as a starting point for insulin 
370 
adjustments and CHO intake that can then be individualised (Figure 2).  
371 
Clinical management strategies should be built around exercise types and individual aims and 
372 
implemented, taking into account the factors summarised in Table 3. Generally, sustained aerobic 
373 
exercise requires more substantial reductions in insulin dose and/or higher CHOs than a shorter-term 
374 
HIIT session. In stark contrast, brief anaerobic exercise (sprinting, weight lifting) may require increased 
375 
insulin delivery, which is typically given in early recovery rather than before exercise for obvious safety 
376 
reasons (48). Strategies for insulin dose adjustments and/or CHO intake during and after planned 
377 
exercise are presented in Table 4. 
378 
 
379 
Insulin adjustment for prolonged activities: bolus insulin approaches 
380 
Pre-exercise meal insulin bolus dose reductions and/or additional CHO consumed during 
381 
exercise are typically needed to avoid hypoglycaemia during prolonged exercise (>30 minutes) 
382 
(34,55,64,84–86). Bolus dose reductions require pre-planning and are probably only appropriate for 
383 
exercise with a predictable intensity performed within 2-3 hours after a meal. As shown in Table 5, the 
384 
 12 
 
extent of mealtime dose reduction is proportional to both the intensity and duration of the activity. This 
385 
approach is safe and effective; even reducing the bolus insulin dose by as much as 75% does not appear 
386 
to increase ketone production during exercise (86). 
387 
Another strategy is to combine the reduction of the pre-exercise insulin bolus dose (by 75%) 
388 
with the ingestion of a low GI snack/meal (87). Importantly, this method also reduces the risk of pre-
389 
exercise hyperglycaemia. However, protection against hypoglycaemia with this approach is lost if the 
390 
exercise is performed an hour or more after the snack (87). As such, this combined approach may be 
391 
preferable only for early postprandial exercise.  
392 
 
393 
Basal insulin approaches 
394 
Late postprandial hypoglycaemia (4+ hours after a meal) following aerobic exercise is driven 
395 
partly by circulating basal insulin concentrations.  Elevated insulin sensitivity post-exercise, and perhaps 
396 
a blunting of glucose counterregulation appear to place individuals at risk for at least 12 hours. Reducing 
397 
circulating basal insulin levels can ameliorate this risk. For patients on multiple daily insulin injections 
398 
(MDI), clinical observations and limited experimental data (88) demonstrate that reducing long acting 
399 
basal (as well as prandial) insulin before exercise reduces hypoglycaemia risk during and after the 
400 
activity, but may promote hyperglycaemia at other points during the day. Therefore reduction in basal 
401 
insulin dose for MDI patients should not be routinely recommended but may be a therapeutic option for 
402 
those having unusual days with considerably more planned activity (e.g. camps, tournaments). In 
403 
general, basal insulins with a relatively short half-life such as NPH-insulin or insulin detemir seem to lead 
404 
to less hypoglycaemia in conjunction with exercise when compared to longer basal insulins such as 
405 
glargine (89), although the mechanism for this is unclear. While ultra-long acting insulins (e.g. insulin 
406 
degludec with a 25hr half-life) pose similar risks for hypoglycaemia with endurance exercise to that of 
407 
insulin glargine (90), dose reductions for exercise would have to be implemented at least 48 hours 
408 
before planned exercise. This is not recommended, as it would compromise overall control. 
409 
CSII offers flexibility to modify basal infusion delivery and to obtain a relatively quick effect 
410 
(within ~1-2hrs) (91). Suspension of basal insulin infusion at the onset of 60-min exercise reduces 
411 
hypoglycaemia risk during the activity, but it may increase post-exercise hyperglycaemia risk (92). 
412 
Moreover, glucose levels may still drop 2-3 mmol/l over 30-60 minutes even when basal insulin is 
413 
dramatically reduced (or completely suspended) (64,92,93), due to the lag time in the change in 
414 
circulating insulin levels. Where practical, a basal rate reduction, rather than suspension, should be 
415 
attempted well before the start of exercise (60-90 minutes). An 80% basal reduction at the onset of 
416 
exercise helps mitigate post-exercise hyperglycaemia, compared to basal suspension, and appears to be 
417 
associated with reduced hypoglycaemic risk both during and after the activity (64). However, the 
418 
optimal timing of basal rate insulin reductions for aerobic and HIE activities and the maximal safe 
419 
duration for insulin pump suspension is unclear and remains open to debate. To limit the risk of 
420 
compromised glycaemic control and ketosis a time limit of <2hours is proposed based on rapid acting 
421 
insulin pharmacokinetics (91).  
422 
 13 
 
Post-exercise hyperglycaemia is a common complaint for patients doing intense exercise, 
423 
particularly if insulin levels are reduced. CSII seems to offer advantages over MDI in managing early 
424 
post-exercise hyperglycaemia (94) and late-onset post-exercise hypoglycaemia (95), due to the 
425 
increased flexibility around basal insulin adjustments. Overcorrection of post-exercise hyperglycaemia 
426 
via repeated insulin dose administration results in increased risk for severe late-onset hypoglycaemia, 
427 
which may even be fatal (49). 
428 
 
429 
Strategies to reduce the risk of post-exercise late-onset hypoglycaemia 
430 
Increased insulin sensitivity lasts up to 24-48 hours following exercise (46). Very few studies 
431 
have tested various nutrient or insulin dose adjustments to prevent hypoglycaemia after exercise. 
432 
Nocturnal hypoglycaemia after exercise is a major occurrence for individuals with T1D (96), with 
433 
increased risk for afternoon exercise (47,97). Immediate increases in post-exercise insulin sensitivity can 
434 
be accommodated for by reductions in the bolus insulin at the meal after exercise by ~50%, along with a 
435 
low GI snack at bedtime (77). In one study of 16 youth, a ~20% temporary pump basal rate reduction 
436 
from bedtime for 6 hours reduced nocturnal hypoglycaemia risk (95). Similarly, in another study of ten 
437 
males on MDI, a 20% basal rate reduction on the exercise day along with a “free” CHO snack at bedtime 
438 
(0.4 g CHO/kg body mass) reduced hypoglycaemia risk overnight (88). Individuals at high risk of severe 
439 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia (e.g., recurrent hypoglycaemia, and those sleeping alone), should take 
440 
additional preventive measures including blood glucose checks at 2-3AM and/or use a real time CGM 
441 
system with alarms and automatic pump suspension (98). A snack alone, without changes to basal 
442 
insulin therapy, does not appear to entirely eliminate nocturnal hypoglycaemia risk (77) and alcohol 
443 
intake may increase risk (99). 
444 
 
445 
Glucose monitoring, CGM and other emerging tools for exercise management 
446 
A range of treatment regimens exists for people with T1D. CSII offers better flexibility in basal 
447 
insulin adjustments and the management of exercise-associated hyperglycaemia (100). CSII is associated 
448 
with reduced post-exercise hyperglycaemia compared to MDI (94), but can create frustrating challenges 
449 
for sports requiring pump disconnection (101). CSII can also contribute to a greater sense of being 
450 
“diseased” for some individuals and may promote stigma (101). Prolonged pump disconnect (> 60 
451 
minutes) should be managed with reconnecting, testing and re-infusion if necessary, or a change to 
452 
basal insulin provision by needle. CGM provides comprehensive information on blood glucose levels, 
453 
real-time trends in glucose levels and rates of glucose change in glucose, which can be used to prevent 
454 
lows during exercise (102), even in unique settings when self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is 
455 
difficult to perform (103). Current sensors are reasonably accurate for exercise (104,105); however, the 
456 
lag time in glucose equilibrium with the interstitial space and the rapid turnover in glucose during 
457 
exercise may impact accuracy (i.e. overestimate glucose value when levels are dropping and 
458 
underestimate it when levels are rising) (106,107). 
459 
 14 
 
Structured educational sessions can be implemented using downloads of SMBG, CGM and CSII 
460 
(108). CGM now offers the option to add “followers” who can view glucose levels in real time and 
461 
potentially alert the patient while he/she is playing sports. Threshold suspension of insulin delivery in 
462 
CSII may offer additional protection against exercise-associated hypoglycaemia according to some 
463 
limited data (109). The development of a fully artificial pancreas for exercise remains an elusive goal 
464 
(110).  
465 
Summary 
466 
Regular physical activity should be a routine objective for patients with type 1 diabetes for a 
467 
variety of health and fitness reasons. Considerable challenges remain for the person with T1D, and their 
468 
HCP team, in exercise/sports management.  A number of small observational studies and a limited 
469 
number of clinical trials have been published to date that help to inform the consensus 
470 
recommendations here. More studies are needed to determine how to best prevent exercise-associated 
471 
hypoglycaemia with basal rate insulin dose adjustments and how to manage in the post-exercise 
472 
recovery period. In general, aerobic exercise is associated with reductions in glycaemia while anaerobic 
473 
exercise may be associated with a transient rise in glucose levels. Both forms of exercise can cause 
474 
delayed-onset hypoglycaemia in recovery. A sound understanding of the physiology of different forms of 
475 
exercise and the variables that can influence glycaemia during exercise and sport should underpin the 
476 
implementation of safe and effective glycaemic management strategies. For aerobic exercise, reductions 
477 
in insulin administration before the activity (basal and/or bolus) can help ameliorate hypoglycaemia risk, 
478 
as can increasing CHO intake to 60 grams per hour or more. For anaerobic exercise, conservative insulin 
479 
dose corrections may be required, although this too may increase the risk for nocturnal hypoglycaemia, 
480 
particularly if the exercise is performed late in the day. In all instances, more vigilance around glucose 
481 
monitoring is needed before, during and after the activity.

▪ 
Aerobic exercise can be started 
▪

Slightly above target 
10.1-15.0 mmol/l) 
▪ 
Aerobic exercise can be started 
▪ 
Anaerobic exercise can be started but glucose levels may rise  
Above target 
(>15 mmol/l) 
▪ 
If the hyperglycaemia is unexplained (not associated with a recent 
meal), check blood ketones. If ketones are modestly elevated (up to 
1.4 mmol/l), exercise should be limited to a light intensity for only a 
brief duration (<30 minutes) and a small corrective insulin dose may 
be needed before the exercise begins. If blood ketones are elevated 
(≥1.5mmol/l), exercise is contraindicated and management should be 
initiated rapidly as per the advice of the HCP/team. 
▪ 
Mild to moderate aerobic exercise may be started if blood ketones 
are low (<0.6 mmol/l) or if urine ketones are less than 2+. Blood 
glucose levels should be monitored during exercise to help notify if 
glucose is rising further. 
▪ 
Intense exercise should be initiated only with caution as it may 
promote a further rise in glycaemia. 
*Note: The CHO intake amounts shown here are to help with glucose stability at the start of exercise. For aerobic 
494 
activities lasting greater than 30 minutes, additional CHOs will likely be needed (see Table 2). Blood glucose levels 
495 
at the start of exercise must also be viewed within a wider context. Factors to consider include directional trends in 
496 
glucose concentrations, insulin levels, patient safety and individual patient preferences based on experience. CHO 
497 
intake will need to be higher if circulating insulin levels are high at the onset of exercise. See Nutritional 
498

Table 3 Examples of factors that need to be considered before making adjustments for exercise. 
507 
Factor 
Effect 
Subcutaneous insulin injection and its adjustments 
 
Difference in injection site and depth affect 
insulin absorption characteristics (113,114).  
 
Lipodystrophy. 
 
Misunderstanding of insulin pharmacokinetic 
often leads to inappropriate insulin 
adjustments, including excessive insulin 
corrections (stacking), which may be 
particularly dangerous after exercise. 
 
Rapid acting (30), regular and intermediate 
acting (115,116), but likely not long acting 
(117) insulin absorption rates are increased 
with exercise. 
CHO intake 
 
Variation in CHO quantity (including 
inaccuracy to evaluate intake) and type will 
impact glycaemic excursions (118). 
Self-monitored capillary glucose measurements 
and CGM 
 
Errors in SMBG sampling or measurement 
errors (SMBG, CGM) may result in 
inappropriate insulin dose estimations 
(119,120). 
 
CGM accuracy, while improving, can be 
compromised by poor SMBG accuracy and 
calibrations methods (121). 
 
Lag time in CGM may impact accuracy during 
exercise (104,106). 
Medications/ alcohol 
 
Insulin sensitivity may be impacted (99) as 
might glucose monitoring tools (120). 
Physiological cycles 
 
Diurnal endocrine variation, menstrual cycle 
and pregnancy impact insulin sensitivity and 
impact glycaemic patterns (122). 
Changes in work and sleep patterns 
 
Require changes in timing of insulin basal 
dose administration. 
 
Timing of exercise should be considered 
relative to insulin sensitivity and nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia risk (47). 
Intercurrence illness and stress 
 
May require changes in both basal and bolus 
insulin dose (123). 
 
Vigorous exercise contraindicated.

conservative bolus dose 
correction if hyperglycaemia 
develops 
Pre-exercise basal insulin dose 
reduction in (MDI patients) by 
~20% 
Useful especially if exercise 
occurs less than every 3 days or if 
exercise levels are elevated 
throughout the day 
May also be useful if on twice 
daily intermediate insulin 
Basal reduction not advised  
Basal nocturnal insulin dose 
reduction (MDI & CSII) following 
exercise by ~20% to reduce 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia 
Particularly important if the 
exercise occurred in the 
afternoon or early evening 
Useful for helping limiting post-
exercise hypoglycaemia after a 
HIIT session 
 
Temporary basal rate change 
(CSII) 
Reduce basal rate to as low as 
total suspension of normal basal 
during exercise 
To take into account rapid acting 
insulin pharmacokinetics, this 
basal rate reduction should 
ideally occur well before exercise 
start (up to 90 minutes before) 
Normal basal rates can be 
resumed either at the end of 
exercise, or later in recovery 
depending on glucose trends 
Increased basal rate may be 
needed to help prevent/treat 
hyperglycaemia either during or 
immediately after exercise 
Pre-exercise CHO intake 
See Table 2 
Not usually needed 
Intra-exercise CHO intake 
Typically up to 60g/h if no insulin 
dose adjustments have been 
made 
See Table 2 for additional 
information 
Not usually needed 
Pre-exercise or post-exercise 
sprint 
May help reduce hypoglycaemia 
risk 
May increase hyperglycaemia 
risk 
Consider a prolonged aerobic 
cool down 
Post-exercise CHO intake 
Useful to reduce risk of 
hypoglycaemia and enhance 
recovery (see Nutritional 
Management section) 
May need a specified insulin 
bolus depending on length and 
intensity of exercise (may need a 
reduced insulin to CHO ratio) 
Useful to reduce risk of 
hypoglycaemia and enhance 
recovery but should be delayed if 
hyperglycaemia is initially 
observed (see Nutritional 
management section) 
May need a specified insulin 
bolus strategy (e.g. may need a 
reduced insulin to CHO ratio)

Figure 1: Blood glucose trends and different forms of exercise. High patient variability exists in the 
858 
blood glucose responses to different form of exercise, as denoted by the arrows and grey shading. In 
859 
general, aerobic exercise lowers glycaemia, anaerobic exercise raises glycaemia and mixed activities is 
860 
associated with relative glucose stability. The individual responses depend on a number of additional 
861 
factors including the duration/intensity of the activity; initial blood glucose level; individual fitness; 
862 
levels of insulin, glucagon, other counterregulatory hormones in circulation; and the nutritional status of 
863 
the individual.

Figure 2: Decision tree for aerobic exercise and mixed aerobic and anaerobic activities lasting 30 min 
866 
or longer. This decision tree can serve as a starting point for decision-making for aerobic exercise. 
867 
Notes: 1 Mixed activities that include anaerobic bursts of exercise may require less carbohydrate intake 
868 
and/or less insulin dose reductions compared continuous moderate aerobic activities. If both resistance 
869 
and aerobic exercise are to be performed, suggest performing resistance first to help attenuate the drop 
870 
in glycaemia. 2 In some situations, increased carbohydrate feeding rather than insulin dose reduction 
871 
may help improve endurance performance in prolonged activities. 3 In other situations, both bolus and 
872 
basal insulin dose reductions may be preferred to help limit CHO needs. Consider CGM where patient or 
873 
parent preference dictates, or with history of nocturnal or severe hypoglycaemia.
