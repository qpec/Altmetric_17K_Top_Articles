Collections of cells called engrams are thought to represent memories. Although there has
been progress in identifying and manipulating single engrams, little is known about how
multiple engrams interact to influence memory. In lateral amygdala (LA), neurons with
increased excitability during training outcompete their neighbors for allocation to an engram.
We examined whether competition based on neuronal excitability also governs the interaction
between engrams. Mice received two distinct fear conditioning events separated by different
intervals. LA neuron excitability was optogenetically manipulated and revealed a transient
competitive process that integrates memories for events occurring closely in time (coallocating
overlapping populations of neurons to both engrams) and separates memories for events
occurring at distal times (disallocating nonoverlapping populations to each engram).
M
emory of an event is thought to be rep-
resented by an ensemble of neurons,
referred to as its memory trace or engram
(1, 2). Despite recent advances in localiz-
ing and manipulating single engrams,
little is known about how multiple engrams inter-
act to influence memory function. Two engrams
mayengagenonoverlappingneuronalpopulations,
thus minimizing interference between distinct
memory representations. Alternatively, engrams
may engage overlapping neuronal populations to
functionally link those memories. Here, we ex-
amined the rules governing engram interaction.
In lateral amygdala (LA), a region critical for
conditioned fear memory (3–5), eligible neurons
compete for engram allocation. Neurons with rela-
tively higher function of transcription factor
CREB or increased excitability at training pref-
erentially win this competition and are allocated
to an engram (6–10). Silencing these neurons pre-
vents memory expression, whereas their activation
artificially elicits memory expression, indicating
that these allocated neurons are both necessary
and sufficient for expression of that memory (7–10).
Similar competition governs engram allocation
in mice without experimental manipulation of
CREB or excitability (11).
We asked if two fear-conditioning events that
occur closely in time are coallocated to over-
lapping populations of neurons, thereby func-
tionally linking these memories. Mice received
two events (event 1, event 2) featuring distinct
auditory conditioned stimuli (CS1 or CS2, Fig.
1A; see supplementary materials) separated by
varying intertraining intervals (ITIs; 1.5, 3, 6,
18, or 24 hours). Event 2 (CS2+footshock) was
the same across groups, but event 1 content and
timing differed. Memory for event 1 was stable
across ITIs (fig. S1B). However, event 2 memory
was enhanced if event 1 (CS1+footshock) occurred
shortlybefore(1.5 to6hours,butnot18 to24hours;
Fig.1Bandfig. S2,BandC), evenif event1consisted
of light-footshock pairing (fig. S2A). Event 2 mem-
ory enhancement depended on previous fear con-
ditioning (not sensitization); mice failed to show
enhanced event 2 memory if event 1 consisted of
CS1 alone or immediate footshock.
To examine if neural representations of events
separated by short (not long) intervals are co-
allocated to overlapping neuronal populations, we
used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for
two activity-dependent genes. Nuclear arc mRNA
labels neurons that were active in the preceding
5 min, whereas nuclearhomer1a(h1a)mRNA labels
neurons that were active in the preceding 30 to
40 min (12). Mice received event 1 and event 2
separated by 6 or 24 hours. During the memory
test, CS1 was presented; then, 25 min later, CS2
was presented. Brains were removed 5 min later.
arc+ neurons were activated by CS2, h1a+ neu-
rons were activated by CS1, and arc+/h1a+ neu-
rons were activated by both CSs (part of both
engrams). Two control groups trained on event
1 only and tested under two conditions provided
upper and lower overlap boundaries. During the
test, the CS1-CS1 group was reexposed to CS1 twice
(h1a+ = first CS1 reexposure, arc+ = second CS1
reexposure, “overlap ceiling”), whereas the CS1-CS3
group was reexposed to CS1 and novel CS3 (“floor”).
Theoverlapobservedinmicetrainedonevent1and
event 2 separated by 24 hours was not different
from floor conditions, whereas the overlap ob-
served in mice similarly trained with a 6-hour
interval was higher, indicating coallocation (Fig. 1C
and fig. S3, A to C).
To test whether coallocation functionally links
memories, we extinguished event 2 memory (repeat-
edly presented CS2 without footshock) and ex-
amined the effect on event 1 memory. After CS2
extinction, all groups froze less to CS2. However,
mice trained with short (6 hours), but not long
(24 hours), ITIs also froze less in response to CS1,
even though CS1 was not explicitly extinguished
(Fig. 1D).
We next examined potential molecular and local
circuit mechanisms governing engram interac-
tion. Fear conditioning transiently (1.5 to 6 hours,
but not 18 to 24 hours) increased the number of
LA principal neurons with activatedCREB (Fig. 2A),
in agreement with reports showing that learning
transiently increases neuronal excitability (13, 14).
CREB function cycles over time, in part, due to
autoregulatory feedback (15) and, consistent with
this, we observed that a depolarizing stimulus in
cultured neurons first activated CREB, then in-
creased an inhibitory CREB isoform (fig. S4).
The oscillation in CREB function and neuronal
excitability provides a potential mechanism by
which engramssupportingevents occurringclosely
in time are coallocated, whereas events occurring
at more remote time points are disallocated (Fig. 2B)
(16).Although the size of an LA engram supporting
a fear memory remains stable, a competitive pro-
cess determines which neurons comprise each
engram (7–10). If event 1 transiently increases CREB
function and neuronal excitability in a popula-
tion of LA neurons and event 2 occurs while these
neurons are more excitable than their neighbors
(within 6 hours), then overlapping neurons would
be coallocated to both events. However, if event 2
occurs when event 1 neurons are no longer more
excitable (e.g., 24 hours after event 1), the engram
underlying event 2 is disallocated, thus function-
ally disambiguating these memories. We tested
these predictions by manipulating LA neuronal
excitability to control allocation. We sought to
force coallocation to artificially link normally
separated memories (24-hour interval) and force
disallocationtoartificiallyseparatenormally linked
memories (6-hour interval).
To bidirectionally manipulate excitability in the
same neuron, we constructed a replication-defective
herpes simplex viral vector (HSV) expressing both
channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2, excitatory opsin) and
halorhodopsin (NpHR3.0, inhibitory opsin) [HSV-
NpACY (17, 18)]. Blue light (via ChR2) increases
excitability, whereas red light (via NpHR3.0) in-
hibits activity (Fig. 3A and figs. S5 and S7). HSV
infects ~15% of LA principal neurons (10) (Fig. 3A
and fig. S6). We verified this approach using one
fear-conditioning event. To allocate HSV-infected
neurons, we excited them (blue light, BL+) before
training (10). To confirm their allocation, we
tested mice under basal conditions (no red light,
RL–) and while inhibiting infected neurons (red
light, RL+). Mice trained immediately after ac-
tivation of infected neurons froze less when these

optogenetically exciting neurons before training
was sufficient for allocation. Inhibiting a similar
number of neurons in control groups (BL–, BL+
24 hours before training, BL+ but no opsin) did
not affect memory expression, nor did BL+ affect
training variables or function as a cue during
the test (fig. S8B).
We confirmed time-limited coallocation of two
events. Principal neurons expressing HSV-NpACY
were excited immediately before event 1. Infected
neurons were coallocated to event 2, if event 2
occurred 6 hours, but not 24 hours, later (Fig. 3C).
To artificially link normally separated memories
(24-hour interval), we excited the same population
of HSV-infected neurons before event 1 and event
2, forcing coallocation. Inhibiting infected neurons

 impaired both event 1 and event 2 memory expres-
sion (Fig. 3D), indicating overlapping engrams of
infected neurons. Similarly, we artificially linked
normally separated memories (24-hour interval)
by virally overexpressing CREB (vCREB) to excite
the same neurons during event 1 and event 2.

To artificially separate normally linked mem-
ories (6-hour interval), we excited infected neu-
rons before event 1, then inhibited (RL+) these
neurons during event 2. Surprisingly, event 2
memory was impaired, even when mice were
tested without red light (Fig. 3E). Event 2
memory was also disrupted if we used vCREB
to allocate neurons before event 1 and DREADDs
to inhibit these neurons during event 2 (fig. S9E).
In contrast, event 2 memory was intact in opto-
genetic experiments if the interval between events
was increased to 24 hours (Fig. 3E). These re-
sults indicate that initially allocated neurons tran-
siently prevent nonallocated neurons from being
allocated to another engram (winning neurons
inhibit losing neurons).
Inneural networks, winner-take-all competition
maintains sparse coding and is regulated by ex-
citation and inhibition (20). Local LA inhibition
is mediated predominantly by g-aminobutyric acid
(GABA)–releasing parvalbumin (PV) interneurons
(21, 22). PV interneurons in LA and basal amygdala
(BA) form an inhibitory network receiving inputs
from, and regulating, LA principal neuron activity
by forming perisomatic synapses (23, 24). Fear con-
ditioning induced a transient increase in periso-
matic PV immunolabeling (24) surrounding LA
principal neurons (1.5 to 6 hours but not 18 to
24 hours, Fig. 4A).
To test whether PV interneurons suppress non-
allocated principal neurons, we released LA and
BA PV inhibition. Transgenic mice expressing Cre
recombinaseinPVinterneurons(PV-Cremice)were
microinjected with adeno-associated virus (AAV)
expressing Cre-dependent hM4Di. Control PV-Cre
mice with intact PV function (vehicle-treated)
similarly showed impaired event 2 memory (Fig. 3E)
if HSV-infectedneurons allocated toevent 1 were
optogenetically silenced during event 2 (6-hour
interval, Fig. 4B). However, inhibiting PV neurons
before event 2 [clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) to acti-
vate hM4Di receptors] permitted event 2 memory
formation. Therefore, if principal neurons not allo-
cated to the engram supporting event 1 (losers) are

BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY
Reciprocal signaling in
honeyguide-human mutualism
Claire N. Spottiswoode,1,2* Keith S. Begg,3 Colleen M. Begg3
Greater honeyguides (Indicator indicator) lead human honey-hunters to wild bees’ nests, in a
rare example of a mutualistic foraging partnership between humans and free-living wild animals.
We show experimentally that a specialized vocal sound made by Mozambican honey-hunters
seeking bees’ nests elicits elevated cooperative behavior from honeyguides. The production of
this sound increased the probability of being guided by a honeyguide from about 33 to 66% and
the overall probability of thus finding a bees’ nest from 17 to 54%, as compared with other
animal or human sounds of similar amplitude.These results provide experimental evidence that
a wild animal in a natural setting responds adaptively to a human signal of cooperation.

n 1588, João dos Santos, a Portuguese mis-
sionary in Sofala (in present-day Mozambique),
oftennoticedasmallbirdflyingthroughcracks
in the walls of his mission church and nibbling
wax from the candlesticks within. This kind
of bird, he wrote, had another peculiar habit of
leading men to bees’ nests by calling and flying
from tree to tree. After the men harvested the
honey, the birds would eat the wax combs left
behind (1). We now know this species to have
been the greater honeyguide Indicator indicator
and dos Santos’s description to have been accu-
rate. Honeyguides eat beeswax and know where
bees’ nests are located; humans can subdue the
bees and open the nest using fire and tools, thus
exposing beeswax for the honeyguides and honey
for the humans (2). This interaction remains an
extremely rare example of mutualism between free-
living wild animals and our own species. Here we
show that it is also a specific example of reciprocal
communication between birds and humans.
Greater honeyguides (Fig. 1A) seeking a hu-
man collaborator approach people and give a
loud chattering call (audio S1). This call is distinct
from their territorial song and is accompanied by
referential gestures (3): the bird flies from tree to
treeinthedirectionofthebees’nestuntilitshuman
follower finds the nest (2, 4). The honeyguide thus
directs a signal of the bees’ nest location toward
humans, and the honey-hunters use this signal
to their mutual advantage. In this study, we ask
whether honeyguides in turn exploit specialized
signals directed at them by humans. We studied
greaterhoneyguides(hereafter“honeyguides”)inthe
Niassa National Reserve in northern Mozambique.
This region has been noted for its honey and bees-
wax production at least since Arab trading times
centuries ago (5, 6). The local Yao people still har-
vest wild honey using traditional methods, and
this practice remains economically important.
First,weconfirmedthatinnorthernMozambique,
honeyguides give reliable information to human
honey-hunters. To test whether guiding behavior
accurately indicates the direction of bees’ nests
and leads to their successful discovery by humans,
we trailed honey-hunters following honeyguides
and tracked our movements via GPS. A guiding
event was defined as a bout of guiding by an
individual bird, sometimes involving consecu-
tive journeys to different bees’ nests. Each guid-
ing event probably involved a different individual
honeyguide, as the study area was 230 km2, and
the home ranges of individual honeyguides that
we measured using radio telemetry did not ex-
ceed 1 km2 and overlapped with one another (7)
(fig. S1). 75.3% of guiding events led to the suc-
cessful discovery by humans of at least one bees’
nest [mean ± SE = 1.00 ± 0.08 nests; range = 0 to
3 nests; n = 97 events, excluding controls in the
experiment discussed below (7)]. 94.6% of nests
shown belonged to the honeybee Apis mellifera,
and the rest to stingless bee species (7). Nests
were located 0 to 832 m (median = 152 m, n = 84
nests, only considering the first nest per guiding
event) from the point where guiding began.
Figure 1B shows that the birds’ initial flight di-
rection accurately signaled the ultimate location
of the bees’ nest, corroborating a classic study from
Kenya (2). Overall, 74.5% of bees’ nests found by
humans(n=149)involvedthehelpofahoneyguide.

often announce their presence with unspecialized
sounds such as shouting and chopping wood (4, 8).
Insome parts of Africa, however, humans also make
specialized vocalizations used only when hunting
honey. In the Niassa National Reserve (and, more
widely, in northern Mozambique and adjacent
southernTanzania), Yaohoney-huntersseeking and
following honeyguides produce a loud trill followed
by a grunt: “brrrr-hm” [audio S1; see (9) for a me-
lodious whistle used in the same context by the
Hadza people of northern Tanzania]. To confirm
that “brrrr-hm” is a specialized honey-hunting
sound, we interviewed 20 Yao honey-hunters, all of
whom reported that they used this specific sound
