ABSTRACT
Athletes participating in elite sports are exposed to high
training loads and increasingly saturated competition
calendars. Emerging evidence indicates that poor load
management is a major risk factor for injury. The
International Olympic Committee convened an expert
group to review the scientific evidence for the
relationship of load (defined broadly to include rapid
changes in training and competition load, competition
calendar congestion, psychological load and travel) and
health outcomes in sport. We summarise the results
linking load to risk of injury in athletes, and provide
athletes, coaches and support staff with practical
guidelines to manage load in sport. This consensus
statement includes guidelines for (1) prescription of
training and competition load, as well as for (2)
monitoring of training, competition and psychological
load, athlete well-being and injury. In the process, we
identified research priorities.
INTRODUCTION
Sport has evolved from games played principally
for entertainment and leisure to a competitive, pro-
fessionalised
industry.1
To
meet
commercial
demands, event calendars have become longer and
increasingly congested, with new single- and multi-
sport events packed into the calendar year.
Inherent to the growth of sport and more strenu-
ous competition programmes, elite and developing
athletes face increasingly greater pressures to stay
competitive.
Consequently,
athletes
and
their
support staff search relentlessly for ways to aggre-
gate marginal gains over time and thus, improve
performance. Although many factors can contrib-
ute, their main instrument is via their training
regimen. Training and competition load stimulates
a series of homeostatic responses and accompany-
ing adaptation of the human body’s systems.2–5
The paramount principle in training theory is to
use this process of biological adaptation to increase
fitness
and
subsequently
improve
performance
(figure 1).4 5 Elite and developing athletes push
their training volume and intensity to the limits to
maximise their performance improvement.
Health professionals who care for elite athletes
are concerned that poorly managed training loads
combined with the increasingly saturated competi-
tion calendar may damage the health of athletes.7–9
It was suggested nearly three decades ago that the
balance between external load and tissue capacity
plays a significant causative role in injury.10
11
Although injury aetiology in sports is multifactorial
and involves extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors,12 13
evidence has emerged that load management is a
major risk factor for injury.14 Insufficient respect of
the balance between loading and recovery can lead
to
prolonged
fatigue
and
abnormal
training
responses (maladaptation),15–18 and an increased
risk of injury and illness (figure 2).14 19
W
e consider the relationship between load and
health as a well-being continuum,16 with load and
recovery as mutual counteragents (figure 3). Sport
and non-sport loads impose stress on athletes, shift-
ing their physical and psychological well-being
along a continuum that progresses from homeosta-
sis through the stages of acute fatigue, functional
and non-functional over-reaching, overtraining syn-
drome, subclinical tissue damage, clinical symp-
toms,
time-loss
injury
or
illness
and—with
continued loading—ultimately death. Death is rare
in sport, and typically coupled with underlying
disease (eg, underlying structural heart disease trig-
gering a fatal arrhythmia). For athletes, deterior-
ation (clinically and in performance) along the
continuum usually stops at time-loss injury or
illness. At that point, the athlete is forced to cease
further loading.
As these biological stages (figure 3) form a con-
tinuum, it is difficult to clearly separate them. For
example, the onset of subclinical tissue damage,
symptoms and injury may happen early or late in
the continuum. With adequate recovery following a
load, however, the process is reversed, tissues
remodel and homeostasis is restored, at a higher
level of fitness and with an improved performance
potential.
A key concept to appreciate for those responsible
for managing load is that maladaptations are trig-
gered not only by poor management of training
and competition loads, but also by interaction with
psychological non-sport stressors, such as negative
life-event stress and daily hassles.16

and intra-individual variation (eg, age, sex, sport,

 fitness, fatigue, health, psychological, metabolic, hormonal and
genetic factors)23 greatly complicate load management in ath-
letes. There can be no ‘one size fits all’ training or competition
programme. Ultimately, the time frame of recovery and adapta-
tion—and hence susceptibility to injury—varies within and
among athletes.
The International Olympic Committee convened a consensus
meeting from 24 to 27 November 2015 where experts in the
field reviewed the scientific evidence for the relationship of load
(including rapid changes in training and competition load, com-
petition calendar congestion, psychological load and travel) and
health outcomes in sport. W
e searched for, and analysed,
current best evidence, aimed at reaching consensus, and provide
guidelines for clinical practice and athlete management. In the
process, we identified urgent research priorities.
TERMINOLOGY AND DEFINITIONS
A consensus regarding definition of key terms provided the basis
for the consensus group, and may also serve as a foundation
for consistent use in research and clinical practice. An extensive
dictionary of all key terms is provided in online supplementary
appendix A.
The term ‘external load’ is often used interchangeably with
‘load’, referring to any external stimulus applied to the athlete
that is measured independently of their internal character-
istics.25 26 Any external load will result in physiological and

Load: more than just workload alone
The term ‘load’ can have different definitions. In general, ‘load’
refers to ‘a weight or source of pressure borne by someone or
something’.24 Based on this definition and variation in the
sports medicine and exercise physiology literature, the
consensus group agreed on a broad definition of ‘load’ as ‘the
sport and non-sport burden (single or multiple physiological,
psychological or mechanical stressors) as a stimulus that is
applied to a human biological system (including subcellular
elements, a single cell, tissues, one or multiple organ systems,
or the individual)’. Load can be applied to the individual human
biological system over varying time periods (seconds, minutes,
hours to days, weeks, months and years) and with varying
magnitude (ie, duration, frequency and intensity).

 psychological responses in each individual, following inter-
action with, and variation in several other biological and envir-
onmental factors.23 27 This individual response is referred to as
‘internal load’ and is discussed in the following section.
MONITORING OF LOAD AND INJURY
Monitoring athletes is fundamental to defining the relationship
between load and risk of injury in care of athletes and also in
research. This includes accurate measurement and monitoring of not
only the sport and non-sport loads of the athletes, but also athletes’
performance, emotional well-being, symptoms and their injuries.
The benefits of scientific monitoring of athletes include explaining
changes in performance, increasing the understanding of training
responses, revealing fatigue and accompanying needs for recovery
,
informing the planning and modification of training programmes
and competition calendars, and, importantly
, ensuring therapeutic
levels of load to minimise the risk of non-functional over-reaching
(fatigue lasting weeks to months), injury and illness.26 28 29
Monitoring external and internal loads
There are many different measures of load (table 1), but the evi-
dence
for
their
validity
as
markers
of
adaptation
and
maladaptation to load is limited. No single marker of an ath-
lete’s response to load consistently predicts maladaptation or
injury.18 23 26 Load monitoring involves measuring external and
internal load, where tools to measure the former can be general
or sports-specific, and for the latter, objective or subjective.30
Measuring the external load typically involves quantifying the
training or competition load of an athlete, such as hours of
training, distance run, watts produced, number of games played
or pitches thrown; however, other external factors, such as life
events, daily hassles or travel, may be equally important.
The internal load is measured by assessing the internal physio-
logical and psychological response to the external load,23 27
and specific examples include measures such as heart rate
(physiological/objective), rating of perceived exertion or inven-
tories for psychosocial stressors (psychological/subjective).
Whereas measuring external load is important in understand-
ing the work completed and capabilities and capacities of the
athlete, measuring internal load is critical in determining the
appropriate stimulus for optimal biological adaptation.2 4 As
individuals will respond differently to any given stimulus, the
load required for optimal adaptation differs from one athlete to
another. For example, the ability to maintain a certain running

 speed or cycling power output for a certain duration may be
achieved with a high or low perception of effort or heart rate,
depending on numerous inter- and intra-individual factors, such
as fitness and fatigue.26
A recent systematic review on internal load monitoring con-
cluded that subjective measures were more sensitive and consist-
ent than objective measures in determining acute and chronic
changes in athlete well-being in response to load.30 The follow-
ing subscales may be particularly useful: non-sport stress, fatigue,
physical recovery, general health/well-being, being in shape,
vigour/motivation and physical symptoms/injury.15–17 31 32 These
variables offer the coach and other support staff essential data on
the athlete’s readiness to train or compete, and may thus inform
individual adjustments to prescribed training.30
Finally, it has been demonstrated that athletes may perform
longer and/or more intense training,33 or perceive loads as sig-
nificantly harder25 34 35 than what was intended by the coach or
prescribed in the training programme. This may pose a consider-
able problem in the long term, as it may lead to maladaptation.
This emphasises the importance of monitoring external and
internal loads in the individual athlete, rather than as a team
average, as it may reveal dissociations between external and
internal loads, and helps ensure that the applied load matches
that prescribed by the coach.26
Monitoring of symptoms and injuries
Injury surveillance is an established part of top-level sport.70–75
Traditional injury surveillance systems rely on a clearly identifi-
able onset and use the duration of time loss from sport to
measure severity.76–79 While acute injury onset is most often
easily identifiable, those related to overuse are by definition the
cumulative result of repeated loading (rather than instantaneous
energy transfer), leading to tissue maladaptation.80 81 Hence,
they have no clear onset, but occur gradually over time, with a
progressive manifestation of clinical symptoms or functional
limitations. They are therefore only reported as an injury when
they meet the operational injury definition used in a particular
study (eg, whether symptom debut, reduced performance or
time loss from sports).
New recommendations have been introduced that not only
prescribe prospective monitoring of injuries with continuous or
serial measurements, but also call for valid and sensitive scoring
instruments, the use of prevalence and not incidence to report
injury risk, and classification of injury severity according to func-
tional level, rather than the duration of time loss from sports.82
Based on these recommendations, novel methodology (often
coupled with new technology such as mobile apps) sensitive to
injury and antecedent symptoms (eg, pain and soreness) and
functional limitations has been developed. Studies using these
tools demonstrate that the prevalence of injuries related to
overuse (due to training and competition maladaptation) repre-
sents as much of a problem as acute injuries in many sports.83–85
LOAD AND RISK OF INJURY IN ATHLETES
All the members of the consensus group were asked to inde-
pendently search and review the literature relating load to injury
in sport and to contribute to a draft document of the results
before meeting in person for 3 days to try to reach consensus.
This meeting provided a further opportunity for the consensus
group to review the literature and to draft a preliminary version
of the consensus statement. W
e agreed on a post hoc literature
search, conducted by the first author of this consensus docu-
ment after the meeting to attempt to capture all relevant scien-
tific information from the different sporting codes. W
e searched
the electronic databases of PubMed (ie, including MEDLINE)
and SPORTDiscus to identify studies for review, using combina-
tions of the terms listed in table 2. Full details on the search
strategy are available from the authors. W
e limited the search to
the English language and studies published prior to June 2016.
Box 1 details the study inclusion criteria.
Final decisions to include publications were based on consen-
sus, and the methodology and results of the publications
(n=104) included in this review are summarised in online sup-
plementary appendix B.
Absolute load and injury risk
The majority of studies on the relationship between load and
injury risk in sport have used various measurements of absolute
load, that is, an athlete’s external or internal load, irrespective
of the rate of load application or load history (see online supple-
mentary appendices A and B). High absolute training and/or
competition load was identified as a risk factor for injury in ath-
letics/running,86–107 baseball,42

 Poorly managed training or competition loads can increase
injury risk through a variety of mechanisms operating either at a
tissue level or at a whole-athlete level. At a tissue level, training
and competition load may lead to excessive microdamage and
injury if the magnitude (intensity, frequency and duration) of
loading is beyond the tissue’s current loadbearing capacity
(sometimes referred to as its ‘envelope of function’),157 or if the
recovery between loading cycles is insufficient (figure 2).158
This mechanism forms the basis of pathoaetiological models of
a range of overuse injury types, including bone stress injur-
ies,159 160 tendinopathy158 and patellofemoral pain.157 It has
also been suggested that cumulative tissue fatigue due to repeti-
tive loading may increase athletes’ susceptibility for injuries typ-
ically thought to be entirely acute in nature, such as anterior
cruciate ligament ruptures;161 however, this hypothesis needs
further corroboration.
At an athlete level, inappropriate loading can increase injury
risk by impairing factors such as decision-making ability, coord-
ination and neuromuscular control. Fatigue from training and
competition leads to reduced muscular force development and
contraction velocity. In turn, this can increase the forces
imposed on passive tissues,162–164 adversely alter kinetics, kine-
matics and neural feedback,165–170 reduce joint stability171–174
and thus contribute to increased risk of acute and overuse
injuries.
The studies associating low absolute loads with an increased
risk of injury98 116 132 134 152–156 may imply inability to cope
with impending higher loads. Training and competition engen-
der a number of adaptations within various bodily systems and
organs, which are specific to the stimuli applied. Depending on
the type of stimulus, defined by the mode of exercise and the
intensity, duration and frequency of loading, neuromuscular,
cardiovascular, skeletal and metabolic adaptations occur.2–5 The
various biological adaptations induced by (appropriate) training
increase athletes’ capacity to accept and withstand load, and
may thus provide athletic resilience to athletes, resulting in pro-
tection from injuries.
Relative load, rapid changes in load and injury risk
While the studies on absolute load document a relationship
between high and low loads and injuries, they fail to take into
account the rate of load application (ie, the load history or
fitness) of the athlete. Recent studies indicate that high absolute
loads may not be the problem per se, but rather excessive
and rapid increases in the load that an athlete is exposed to rela-
tive to what he/she is prepared for, with evidence emerging
from
Australian
football,150
152
175–177
basketball,178
cricket,116 179 football,180–182 rugby league122 183–185 and rugby
union.127 Specifically, large week-to-week changes in load (rapid
increases in intensity, duration or frequency) have been shown
to
place
the
athlete
at
a
significantly
increased
risk
of
injury.45 127 152 175 177
Based on earlier work by Banister and Calvert,67 Gabbett and
colleagues45 186 recently introduced the concept of the acute:
chronic load ratio to model the relationship between changes in
load and injury risk (figure 4). This ratio describes the acute
training load (eg, the training load of the last week) to the
chronic load (eg, the 4-week rolling average of load). If chronic
load has been progressively and systematically increased to high
levels (ie, the athlete has developed fitness) and the acute load is
low (ie, the athlete is experiencing minimal fatigue), then the
athlete is considered well prepared. Conversely, if acute load
exceeds the chronic load (ie, acute loads have been rapidly
increased, resulting in fatigue, or training over the last 4 weeks
has been inadequate to develop fitness), then the athlete is con-
sidered underprepared and likely at an increased risk of injury.
Hence, this model takes into account the positive and negative
effects of training and competition loads. The model has
currently been validated through data from three different
sports (Australian football, cricket and rugby league),187 demon-
strating that injury likelihood is low (<10%) when the acute:
chronic load ratio is within the range of 0.8–1.3. However,
when the acute:chronic load ratio exceeds 1.5 (ie, the load in
the most recent week is 1.5 times greater than the average of
the last 4 weeks), the likelihood of injury more than doubles
(figure 4).183 187
Interestingly, there are reports of a latent period of increased
injury risk following rapid increases in load. For example, Hulin
et al179 183 found that an acute:chronic load ratio higher than 1.5
had little to no effect on injury likelihood in the current week,
but that the likelihood of injury in the week following a rapid
increase in load was two to four times higher. Furthermore,
Orchard et al113 found a delayed injury risk lasting up to a
month following a rapid load increase in cricket fast bowlers.
Overall, these data suggest that team-sport athletes respond
significantly better to relatively small increases (and decreases),
rather than larger fluctuations in loading. Provided that the
athlete reaches these loads in a gradual and controlled fashion,
high loads and physically hard training appear to offer a pro-
tective effect against injuries, due to the mediating effect on
adaptation and the development of physical qualities. Pending
confirmation through research, it is generally believed that
the same principles are applicable in athletes participating in
individual endurance188 and technical sports.
Competition calendar congestion and injury risk
Through intensified participation, competition typically places
greater demands on the athlete than does training (when expos-
ure is adjusted for). Depending on the magnitude of the increase
in intensity, it can be argued that competition itself should be
regarded as a rapid increase in load (ie, high acute load through
competition), relative to what the athlete is prepared for (lower
chronic load through training). This could be one contributing
factor to the significantly elevated injury rates typically found in
competition compared to training across sports, with competi-
tion identified as an injury risk factor in the literature.189
Calendar
congestion,

to
the

matches/events over a shorter period of time than usual, may
represent an exacerbated rapid increase in the acute load
imposed on the athlete. Of the 12 studies exploring this rela-
tionship, eight (four in elite football, two in elite and junior

found that competition congestion leads to increased injury
rates,37 111 112 190–194 whereas four (two in elite football, one in
elite cricket and one in elite rugby league) found no significant
associations.115 184 195 196 In cricket, Dennis et al111 found that
elite fast bowlers having <2 or ≥5 days of recovery days
between bowling sessions, as well as junior fast bowlers with an
average of <3.5 rest days,112 were at significantly increased risk
of injury. In comparison, Orchard et al115 found a non-
significant trend that elite bowlers who exceed 100 overs in
17 days are at an increased risk of injury.
Jayanthi et al190 investigated the medical withdrawal rates in
US T
ennis Association junior national tennis tournaments, and
found that the number of medical withdrawals increased signifi-
cantly if players played five or more, compared with four or less
matches in a tournament. Comparative data from elite tennis are
currently non-existent. In elite rugby league, two studies have
explored the relationship between match congestion and injury
risk. Murray et al192 found that match congestion can lead to
either high or low injury rates, depending on the playing pos-
ition and its inherent game demands. In contrast, Hulin et al184
found no difference in injury risk between short and long recov-
ery periods.
In football, six studies have investigated the impact of either
short37 191 193 195 or prolonged191 194 196 periods of match con-
gestion on subsequent injury rates, with match congestion typic-
ally defined as playing two matches per week, compared to one,
albeit using different cut-offs for days of in-between recovery.
Whereas no difference was found in injury rates in match cycles
with ≤3 days compared to ≥4 days in-between recovery,191 195
significantly higher injury rates were observed in match cycles
with ≤3 days193 194 or ≤4 days37 191 193 compared to ≥6 days
of between-match recovery. Other reports on prolonged conges-
tion periods (weeks) and injury rates have provided conflicting
results; Bengtsson et al191 observed higher muscle injury rates
during matches in congested periods, whereas Carling et al196
found no association.
Although there are some conflicting results and limited data,
the majority of the available data on competition frequency
seems to demonstrate that a congested competition calendar is
associated with an increased risk of competition injury. In foot-
ball, a pattern is emerging where two, compared to one match
per week, significantly increases the risk of match injury.
Overall, training injuries seem uninfluenced, or even reduced,194
during periods of match congestion. It is possible that this can
be attributed to deliberate downregulation of the training load,
as orienting the training towards recovery during periods of
competition congestion is a customary practice in elite sport.
Psychological load and injury risk
A number of psychological variables may influence injury risk.
These include psychological stressors, such as negative life-event
stress,22

197–203 daily hassles32
204–207 and sports-related
stress (eg, feeling of insufficient breaks and rest, stiff and tense

state anxiety,203 stress susceptibility,205 type A behaviours,210
trait irritability205 and mistrust,22 as well as maladaptive coping
strategies.22 149 205 211
The proposed mechanism by which psychological stress
responses increase injury risk is through attentional and somatic
changes such as increased distractibility and peripheral narrow-
ing, as well as muscle tension, fatigue and reduced timing/coord-
ination.32 197 198 200 207 The evidence for the potential of daily
hassles to predict injuries may be particularly important, as it
suggests a potential rapid change to the injury risk to which an
athlete is exposed.32 206 Furthermore, the burden placed on ath-
letes undergoing major negative life events or chronic daily
hassles may also increase their vulnerability to consider other
minor stressors and events as stressful.32
Travel load and injury risk
The modern-day elite athlete typically competes in a number of
international competitions and tournaments. This necessitates
international travel not only for competition purposes, but also
to attend training camps. Long-distance air travel across several
time zones exposes passengers to travel fatigue and jet lag,
which is suggested to negatively influence performance212–214
and susceptibility to illness.215 216 However, no link has yet
been established for injuries. Fuller et al217 and Schwellnus
et al218 found no evidence to suggest that extensive air travel
and crossing multiple time zones led to an increase risk of injury
in elite rugby union players. Similarly, Fowler et al219 observed
no significant effect of regular national travel on recovery or
injury rate in professional Australian soccer players.
Methodological considerations
There are a number of reasons for the significant heterogeneity
among the included papers on the relationship between load
and injury risk in this consensus paper. The studies were con-
ducted in different sports, on samples of different skill levels,
ages and sizes, and have employed a wide variety of research
designs and methodologies, including different definitions and
measurement methods of load and injury. It is perhaps not sur-
prising, for example, that a cross-sectional registration of high
weekly distance of swimming yields different results on the
prevalence of shoulder supraspinatus tendinopathy in 80 male
and female elite swimmers with a mean age of 16 years128 than
does prospective recording of high session ratings of perceived
exertion (session RPE) on injury incidence in 220 male rugby
league players with a mean age of 21 years.121
The findings show that one of the most frequently used mea-
sures
of
load
is
the
session
RPE,117
120–124
127
146
150 152 153 175 178 179 or similar cross-products of training dur-
ation and subjectively reported intensity.104 105 149 These tools
are particularly common in team sports, and have the advantage
of combining external (duration) and internal (rating of per-
ceived exertion) load, which may aid in revealing fatigue.26 30
However, these tools also have limitations in that they do not
differentiate between short high-intensity sessions and long low-
intensity sessions. For example, a 30-min session with an RPE
of 8 and a 120-min session with an RPE of 2 will yield a session
RPE of 240; however, the two sessions likely have very different
effects on injury risk and pattern.
Load is also commonly recorded and reported as the exposure to
training per unit of time90 106 131 132 134 139 140 144 145 148 151 156
or the distance (mileage) of running, cycling or swimming.86–100
102 103 107 128–130 134 137 139–143 155 However, these are highly
inaccurate measures of load, as they fail to account for the intensity
,
movement repetitions or impact load performed. Recently
, it has
become increasingly popular to use global positioning system/micro-
technology units to quantify running load, particularly in team
sports.147 150–152 176 177 181–184 188 In certain individual sports such
as cycling, the use of load sensors allows for composite measures
incorporating training volume and intensity
. In early baseball and
cricket research, throw counts emerged as a simple and potentially
effective technique to monitor load, with reports that exceeding
thresholds of pitches (eg, pitching >100 innings per year)110 or

 throws (eg, completing >75 throws per week)114 significantly
increased the risk of injury
. However, measures relying solely on
external load do not take into account the intensity of the training
or internal response of the athlete, and may therefore have problems
with sensitivity and specificity in the identification of athletes in mal-
adaptive states.
The variation in results may also be explained by differences
in research design and data analysis. The studies on calendar
congestion are specifically limited by (1) small sample sizes (fol-
lowing players from only one team),37 184 192–196 which may
restrict external validity and increase the risk of statistical
(random)
error,
(2)
disregarding
individual
exposure
and
thereby player rotation strategies,191 194–196 which potentially
can dilute the actual injury risk of a player exposed to the full
load or (3) employing retrospective cross-sectional designs.190
Most of the studies employ either prospective/retrospective
cohort or cross-sectional designs. While these studies may dem-
onstrate an association (correlation) between the independent
(load) and dependent (injury) variables, the main challenge is to
rule out interaction with potential confounding factors. The
best study design to examine and identify risk factors that
predict injury or illness is large-scale (multicentre) prospective
cohort studies. Nonetheless, unlike experimental studies such as
randomised controlled trials, cohort and cross-sectional studies
rely on adequate data collection and subsequent multivariate
analysis to control for the effect of and interaction with other
variables—and thereby strengthen the causal relationship. In
contrast, the use of univariate analyses, or failing to record data
on extraneous variables that influence the dependent variable,
may produce spurious results and lead to incorrect conclusions.
Timpka et al149 recently demonstrated the importance of con-
trolling for the potentially complex interactions between risk
factors, when they integrated psychological with physiological
and epidemiological data from elite track and field athletes, and
found
that
the
maladaptive
coping
behaviour
self-blame
replaced training load as a risk factor for overuse injury. The
authors suggested that overuse injuries in athletics may not be
predicted by the training load per se,104 but rather by high load
applied in situations when the athlete is in need of rest. Their
findings are important, as they emphasise both the need to
control for all risk factors, and that adaptations that occur may
lead to large variations in an individual’s ability to accept and
respond to load, which can alter risk and affect aetiology in a
dynamic, recursive fashion.13
PRACTICAL GUIDELINES FOR LOAD MANAGEMENT
The aim of load management is to optimally configure training,
competition and other load to maximise adaptation and per-
formance with a minimal risk of injury. Load management
therefore comprises the appropriate prescription, monitoring
and adjustment of external and internal loads, for which a
number of key practical guidelines can be provided.
Prescribing training and competition load
Evidence is emerging that poor load management with ensuing
maladaptation is a major risk factor for sports injury. The limita-
tion of data to a few select sports and athlete populations, com-
bined with the distinct natures of different sports, make it
difficult to provide sport-specific guidelines for load manage-
ment. However, certain general points can be made:
▸ High loads can have either positive or negative influences on
injury risk in athletes, with the rate of load application and
intrinsic risk factor profile being critical factors. Athletes
respond significantly better to relatively small increases (and
decreases), rather than larger fluctuations in loading. While it
is likely that different sports will have different load-injury
profiles, current evidence from Australian football, cricket
and rugby league suggests that athletes should limit weekly
increases of their training load to <10%, or maintain an
acute:chronic load ratio within a range of 0.8–1.3, to stay in
positive adaptation and thus reduce the risk of injuries.
▸ In football, playing two matches (ie, ≤4 days recovery
between matches), compared to one match per week,
increases the risk of injury. In these circumstances, football
teams should consider using squad rotation to prevent large
increases in match loads for individual players.
▸ Load should always be prescribed on an individual and flexible
basis, as there is large inter- and intra-individual variation in
the time frame of response and adaptation to load.
▸ Special attention should be given to load management in
developing athletes, who are at increased risk when intro-
duced to new loads, changes in loads or congested competi-
tion calendars.180 220–222
▸ Variation in an athlete’s psychological stressors should also
guide the prescription of training and/or competition loads.
▸ Coaches and support staff must schedule adequate recovery,
particularly after intensive training periods, competitions and
travel, including nutrition and hydration, sleep and rest,
active rest, relaxation strategies and emotional support.
▸ Sports governing bodies must consider the health of the athletes,
and hence, the competition load when planning their event
calendars. This requires increased coordination between single-
sport and multisport event organisers, and the development of a
comprehensive calendar of all international sports events.
Monitoring load
Scientific monitoring of the athlete’s loads is key to successful
load management, athlete adaptation and injury mitigation in
sport.
▸ Coaches and support staff are recommended to employ sci-
entific methods to monitor the athlete’s load and detect
meaningful change.
▸ Load should always be monitored individually.
▸ No single marker has been validated to identify when an
athlete has entered a maladaptive state; hence, it is recom-
mended to use a combination of external and internal load mea-
sures that are relevant and specific to the nature of each sport.
▸ Subjective load measures are particularly useful, and coaches
and
support
staff
may
employ
them
with
confidence.
Subscales that evaluate non-sport stress, fatigue, physical
recovery, general health/well-being and being in shape are
responsive to acute and chronic training.30
▸ Load is not an isolated variable, but must be monitored using
a comprehensive approach taking into account interaction
with and relative contributions from other intrinsic and
extrinsic factors, such as injury history, physiological, psycho-
logical (eg, non-sport loads), biochemical, immunological,
environmental and genetic factors, as well as age and sex.
▸ Special consideration should be given to the monitoring of
acute and chronic loads, and the acute:chronic load ratio of
the individual athlete.
▸ Monitoring should be performed frequently (eg, daily or
weekly measures self-administered by the athlete) to enable
acute adjustments to training and competition loads as
required; however, with consideration given to minimising
the burden on athletes.

 Psychological load management
Psychological load (stressors), such as negative life-event stress
and daily hassles, can significantly increase the risk of injury in
athletes. Clinical practical recommendations centre on reducing
state-level stressors and educating athletes, coaches and support
staff in proactive stress management, and comprise:32
▸ Developing resilience strategies to help athletes understand
the relationship between personal traits, negative life events,
thoughts, emotions and physiological states, which, in turn,
may help them minimise the impact of negative life events
and the subsequent risk of injury.
▸ Educating athletes in stress-management techniques, confi-
dence building and goal setting, optimally under supervision
of a sport psychologist, to help minimise the effects of stress
and reduce the likelihood of injury.
▸ Reducing training and/or competition load and intensity to
mitigate injury risk for athletes who appear unfocused as a
consequence of negative life events or ongoing daily hassles.
▸ Implementing periodical stress assessments (eg, hassle and
uplift scale,52 or life events survey for collegiate athletes50) to
inform adjustment of athletes’ training and/or competition
loads. An athlete who reports high levels of daily hassle or
stress could likely benefit from reducing the training load
during a specified time period to prevent potential fatigue,
injuries or burnout.32
Monitoring of injury
The use of sensitive measures to monitor an athlete’s health can
lead to early detection of symptoms and signs of injury, early
diagnosis and appropriate intervention. Athletes’ innate ten-
dency to continue to train and compete despite the existence of
physical symptoms or functional limitations, particularly at the
elite level, highlights the pressing need to use appropriate injury
monitoring tools.
▸ On-going, scientific injury (and illness) surveillance systems
should be established in all sports.
▸ Monitoring tools must be sensitive not only to acute and
overuse injuries, but to early clinical symptoms, such as pain
and functional limitations.
▸ Injury monitoring should ideally be on-going, but must at
least occur for a period of time (eg, at least 4 weeks) after
rapid increases in loads.
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR LOAD MANAGEMENT IN
SPORT
In general, there is a paucity of research data on the relationship
between load (training, competition, competition calendar con-
gestion, psychological, travel or other) and injury risk, with
limited evidence from a few select sports.
The potential of future research lies in informing the develop-
ment of training and competition programmes tailored to the
needs of the individual, following interaction with and variation
in other risk factors. W
e identified that research should be direc-
ted towards:
▸ Promoting further large-scale prospective cohort studies
investigating the dose–response relationship between load
and injury. Particular focus should be placed on the potential
interactions with and relative contributions from other
physiological, psychological, environmental and genetic risk
factors, to further elucidate the global capacity of individuals
to adapt to different loads at any given time.
▸ Increasing the understanding on how psychological and psy-
chosocial factors interact with physiological and mechanical
factors to increase injury vulnerability.
▸ Exploring whether it is possible, taking into account inter-
and intra-individual variation, to identify optimal training
and competition loads (or upper limits) for elite and devel-
oping athletes in different sports, including training intensity,
duration and frequency, competition frequency (calendar
congestion and cut-offs for the number of recovery days) and
season duration.
▸ Conducting further studies on the impact of the acute:
chronic load ratio (ie, rapid increases/decreases in load com-
pared to relatively stable loading) on injury risk in multiple
sports, including individual endurance and technical sports.
▸ Investigating the potential latent period (time frame of onset
and end) of increased injury risk following (rapid) changes in
load.
▸ Elucidating
special
needs,
competition
matching
and
load-induced adaptations in young talented athletes.
▸ Studying the effects of short and prolonged competition con-
gestion in sports, using individual, rather than team load, data.
▸ Examining the effects of periodisation on injury risk in
sport.
▸ Validating the efficacy and sensitivity of established and
emerging external and internal load monitoring measures to
identify maladaptation and increased injury risk in athletes.
▸ Elucidating the influence of load and recovery on the devel-
opment of fatigue, subclinical tissue damage, clinical symp-
toms and injury.
▸ Further examining the relationship (including mechanisms)
between travel fatigue and jet lag, and injury risk.
▸ Exploring the possibility of using experimental research
designs, such as randomised controlled trials, to evaluate the
effect of load monitoring interventions (eg, confining the
acute:chronic load ratio between 0.8 and 1.3) compared with
a control group (eg, usual loading routines) on injury rates in
sport.
▸ Reviewing sport-governing bodies’ initiatives to mitigate
load-induced health problems, and assessing the effectiveness
of current policies and practices. As with all research, there is
a need to look to innovative policies and tools223 to promote
knowledge translation.
SUMMARY
Data on the relationship between load and risk of injury are
limited to a few select sports and athlete populations. High loads
can have either positive or negative influences on injury risk in
athletes, with the rate of load application in combination with the
athlete’s internal risk factor profile likely being critical factors.
Athletes respond significantly better to relatively small increases
(and decreases), rather than larger fluctuations in loading. There
is evidence from some sports that if load is applied in a moderate
and progressive manner, and rapid increases in load—relative to
what the athlete is prepared for—are avoided, high loads and
physically hard training may offer a protective effect against injur-
ies. Load must always be prescribed on an individual and flexible
basis, as there is large inter- and intra-individual variation in the
time frame of response and adaptation to load. Regular athlete
monitoring is fundamental to ensure appropriate and therapeutic
levels of external and internal loads and thus to maximise per-
formance and minimise the risk of injury. Sports governing bodies
must consider the health of the athletes, and hence, the overall
competition load when planning event calendars. More research
is needed on the impact of competition calendar congestion and
rapid changes in load on injury risk in multiple sports, as well as
on the interaction with other physiological, psychological, envir-
onmental and genetic risk factors.
