BACKGROUND: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs), mostly
conducted among minority populations, have reported
that motivational interviewing (MI) can improve medica-
tion adherence.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of MI and of the MI
delivery format, fidelity assessment, fidelity-based feed-
back, counselors’ background and MI exposure time on
adherence.
DATA SOURCES: We searched the MEDLINE database
for studies published from 1966 until February
2015.
STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included RCTs that
compared MI to a control group and reported a numerical
measure of medication adherence.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The main outcome was medica-
tion adherence defined as any subjective or objective
measure reported as the proportion of subjects with
adequate adherence or mean adherence and stan-
dard deviation. For categorical variables we calculat-
ed the relative risk (RR) of medication adherence,
and for continuous variables we calculated the stan-
dardized mean difference (SMD) between the MI and
control groups.
RESULTS: We included 17 RCTs. Ten targeted adherence
to HAART. For studies reporting a categorical measure
(n = 11), the pooled RR for medication adherence was
higher for MI compared with control (1.17; 95 % CI 1.05-
1.31; p < 0.01). For studies reporting a continuous mea-
sure (n = 11), the pooled SMD for medication adherence
was positive (0.70; 95 % CI 0.15-1.25; p < 0.01) for MI
compared with control. The characteristics that were sig-
nificantly (p < 0.05) associated with medication adherence
were telephonic MI and fidelity-based feedback among
studies reporting categorical measures, group MI and fi-
delity assessment among studies reporting continuous
measures and delivery by nurses or research assistants.
Effect sizes differed in magnitude, creating high
heterogeneity.
CONCLUSION: MI improves medication adherence at dif-
ferent exposure times and counselors’ educational level.
However, the evaluation of MI characteristics associated
with success had inconsistent results. Larger studies
targeting diverse populations with a variety of chronic
conditions are needed to clarify the effect of different MI
delivery modes, fidelity assessment and provision of fidel-
ity based-feedback.

INTRODUCTION
Lack of adherence to medications causes excess morbidity and
mortality and annual health care costs of over 1 billion.1, 2 In
the USA, 33 to 69 percent of medication-related hospital stays
were found to be due to poor adherence to medications.1 Thus,
finding strategies to improve adherence to medications has
become a global priority.
A promising approach is the use of cognitive-based behavior
strategies such as motivational interviewing (MI).3, 4 MI is a
strategy that aims to help individuals articulate and resolve their
ambivalence regarding a behavior and encourages the intrinsic
motivation to find individualized solutions.5 The use of MI has
expanded over the years from substance abuse to adherence to
HAART and more recently to adherence to other chronic med-
ications.6–8 Most studies to date have focused on minority pop-
ulations. A recent systematic review evaluated the impact of
cognitive-based behavior change techniques on adherence3 and
found them to be superior to usual care; however, this review
included multi-layer cognitive interventions and did no focus
exclusively on MI. Thus, we evaluated the impact of MI-based
interventions on adherence and the effect of the MI delivery
method, fidelity assessment, fidelity-based feedback to the MI
counselors, MI exposure time and the educational background of
the counselors. This knowledge will allow us to understand what
operational factors of MI, if any, influence medication adherence.
METHODS
Search Strategy
A search was conducted through the MEDLINE database by
using PubMed, which contained articles from 1966 until
February 2015. We filtered all articles except those containing

 key terms such as motivational interviewing and medication
adherence, compliance and persistence. More specifically, the
search was performed by entering: (Bmedication adherence^
[MeSH Terms] OR (Bmedication^ [All Fields] AND
Badherence^ [All Fields]) OR Bmedication adherence^ [All
Fields]) OR (Bpatient compliance^ [MeSH Terms] OR
(Bpatient^ [All Fields] AND Bcompliance^ [All Fields]) OR

[All Fields] AND (Bmotivational interviewing^ [MeSH
Terms] OR (Bmotivational^ [All Fields] AND Binterviewing^
[All Fields]) OR Bmotivational interviewing^ [All Fields]). All
searches were conducted in February 2015 and were supple-
mented by manual searches of bibliographies of key relevant
articles. The protocol is available for review but was not
registered before data extraction started.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We included randomized trials that compared MI to one or
more control groups, reported a measure of medication adher-
ence in numerical form, had a follow-up period of any length
and were published in English. We excluded studies that used
MI in combination with other strategies since the isolated
effect of MI could not be determined.
Selection Criteria
Two investigators (LT and BL) reviewed the abstract of each
citation and identified abstracts for full-text review. Two pairs
of investigators (BL and LT; AP and DG) reviewed all full-text
articles and selected those that met eligibility for inclusion into
the systematic review. The interrater agreement on article
selection between the two pairs of investigators was 95 %.
After completing data collection, two investigators (LT and
AP) identified articles with comparable adherence measures
and classified them into either categorical or continuous ad-
herence outcomes for the purpose of the meta-analysis.
Data Collection
Two investigators completed the evidence tables (BL and DG)
using previously piloted data extraction forms. LT and AP
reviewed all articles in duplicate and confirmed the accuracy
of the data abstracted. Differences between the two final
reviewers were resolved by consensus among the four authors.
Primary Outcome: Definition of Medication
Adherence
We defined two types of adherence measures: self-reported
and objective. The self-reported measures included previously
validated scales that defined adherence as percent or number
of doses taken during a pre-specified period of time. Objective
measures were collected by medication event monitoring sys-
tems (MEMS) or pharmacy claims data and defined as percent
of doses taken or available during the study period or percent-
age of people with adequate adherence.1, 9 Measures could be
reported in either continuous or categorical form. Continuous
measures were defined as a mean with standard deviation.
Categorical measures were defined as the proportion of sub-
jects with adequate adherence. Adequate adherence was de-
fined as taking or having medication for 80 to 100 % of the
time depending on the study.9
Definition of Motivational Interviewing
We considered an intervention MI if the methods specifically
described MI or the MI principles as the main strategy of
counseling for that arm.5 MI is a clinical method of guiding
patients to make changes in the interest of their health by
eliciting the patient’s own motivation for change.5
Definition of MI Intervention Characteristics
MI delivery mode: We classified delivery into telephonic,
in-person individual, group or mixed delivery if two or more
approaches were used for the majority of participants.
Fidelity: This was considered present when the authors
reported a sampling strategy for the encounters and a
structured tool to measure fidelity.10
Fidelity-based feedback: This was considered present when
the authors reported that feedback was given on the MI
principles or skills.
Background of counselors: We classified the counselors
delivering the intervention according to their level of
education or background.
Exposure time: To assess the effect of time we divided the
duration of the MI encounters into tertiles as there is no
known cutoff to assure efficacy and calculated the RR and
SMD stratified by tertiles.11
Quality Evaluation
We used the PRISMA guidelines to evaluate quality.12 For
evaluation of the risk of bias at the study level we used data
abstraction forms to collect: concealment of allocation, loss to
follow-up, intention to treat, success of randomization, sample
size calculation, missing data, recall and measurement bias,
and reporting of outcomes outlined in the methods. Four
investigators were responsible for completing the quality eval-
uation (BL, LT, DG, JT). Differences between the reviewers
were resolved by consensus (lead by AP), and we calculated
the interrater agreement. We evaluated risk of bias across
studies by identifying selective reporting and publication bias.
We used Begg’s funnel plot and Egger’s regression asymmetry
test to evaluate publication bias.13
Statistical Analysis
We reported relevant baseline characteristics as median values
with the interquartile range (IQR). To assess for heterogeneity
across studies, we used the Cochran Q chi-square statistic and
the I-squared statistic. We defined heterogeneity as an I-
squared greater than 50 %.

 For the quantitative analysis we used Stata 12 (StataCorp
LP, College Station, TX). Our initial analysis included all
studies that reported at least one follow-up time point of
medication adherence; when studies reported multiple time
points we used the longest follow-up measure. Because we
included studies reporting categorical or continuous medica-
tion adherence measures we stratified the analysis. Studies that
reported continuous and categorical measures were included
in both types of analyses. For categorical measures we calcu-
lated the relative risk (RR) of being adherent with the respec-
tive 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values for all
studies. Because of significant heterogeneity we used the
DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model to calculate
the pooled RR. For continuous measures we calculated the
standardized mean difference (SMD) subtracting the mean
measure of adherence in the MI intervention arm minus the
mean measure of adherence in the control arm for each study.
Therefore, a positive SMD indicates a higher adherence for
those in the MI arm. We then calculated the pooled SMD for
all studies using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects
model.
Weights for the pooled statistics were calculated using
sample size for both continuous and categorical measures of
adherence.
If heterogeneity was identified, we evaluated its determi-
nants by including the suspected variables into a
metaregression model.14 The metaregression model included
the log of the relative risk of adequate adherence as the
dependent variable and MI delivery method, fidelity assess-
ment, fidelity-based feedback and counselors’ background as
the independent variables.
RESULTS
Literature Search
Our search yielded 336 abstracts. We excluded 270 studies at
the abstract level and selected 66 for full-text review; of the 66
selected for full text review, we excluded 49 and included 17
studies. Figure 1 describes reasons for exclusion.
Quality of the Studies and Evaluation of Bias
Our study level bias evaluation revealed that all studies report-
ed outcomes outlined in methods, nine studies did not report
concealment of allocation, six did not report ITT analyses,
nine had no sample size calculations, and eight were under-
powered including six that were pilot studies.15–20
Studies that did not mention ITT15, 16, 20–23 required follow-
up visits for outcome ascertainment and used all available data
for comparisons of the randomized arms. Loss to follow-up in
any arm ranged from 1 % to 33 % (Table 1) with seven studies
surpassing 20 %.16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25 One study did not report
loss to follow-up by study arm,21 one had differential loss,16
and three did not comment on differences in baseline
characteristics by study completion status.16, 17, 21 Thirteen
reported no differences in characteristics by completion status,
and one reported that subjects lost to follow-up in the MI
group had a trend toward more depressive symptoms.15
Of studies with objective adherence measures, seven report-
ed having missing data,18, 19, 25–29 but only two studies had
missing data in more than 20 % of the sample.18, 28 All
described this occurrence as non-differential among study
arms. All but one study24 compared baseline characteristics
between arms. All had balanced groups or adjusted for minor
differences. Only a pilot study by Holstad et al.16 was unable
to address a difference in distribution in tribal origin that could
influence the adherence measure.
The most common limitations reported by authors regard-
ing threats to validity were: generalizability, inclusion of sub-
jects with high adherence at baseline,18, 20, 24, 25, 28, 30, 31 lack
of statistical power,15–19, 28, 30, 32 and recall bias and social
desirability for studies reporting only self-reported measures16,
23 and including only subjects with low adherence leading to a
recruitment challenge.17 The authors offered adequate expla-
nations on how they dealt with these limitations with the
exception of social desirability, which remains as a possible
source of bias for those two studies.
Even though no study had differential challenges measuring
adherence, many authors commented on the pitfalls of the
different strategies, in particular the challenges of using
MEMS.17, 18, 20, 22, 26, 30
Baseline Characteristics of the Studies
Table 1 reports the baseline characteristics of the studies. The
17 studies randomized 1,376 subjects into the MI group and
1,153 subjects to the control group. Fourteen of the 17 studies
were conducted in the US. Thirteen studies14 were conducted
in outpatient clinics caring for the population of interest, most
commonly in large metropolitan areas. Studies that used
telephone-based MI exclusively identified eligible subjects
from either a registry21 or from health or pharmacy benefit
programs.27, 32 The most commonly evaluated medications
were highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Among
the 13 studies that reported race/ethnicity, 12 focused on
minorities and 1963 individuals (48 %) belonged to a racial
minority. The median age of the population was 43 IQR
years33–39, the median percentage of women included in the
studies was 65 % IQR (35–86), and the median percentage of
unemployed participants was 49 % IQR (32–83).
Description of the Motivational Interviewing
Intervention
Table 2 describes details of the intervention and control
groups. Most studies included an adequate description of MI
and the intervention procedures. The authors reported using
known MI strategies and many described topics for specific
sessions. Of the 17 retained studies, 8 delivered the MI ses-
sions individually in person, 3 had a group MI format, 3 were
931

JGIM
 exclusively delivered over the phone, and 3 had a mixed
approach.
The intervention lasted 3 months or less in eight of the
studies and from 4 to 12 months in nine of them. The frequen-
cy of the MI sessions ranged from 1 week apart to 12 weeks
apart for those studies with longer intervention periods. Ten
studies scheduled more than one MI encounter during the first
month of the study. Eleven studies reported the intended
duration of each MI encounter, which ranged from 30 min to
2 h (for group MI). Most of the studies described MI encoun-
ters lasting 45 to 60 min.
Three studies provided additional materials to the MI
groups. These included video or audiotapes, educational ma-
terials, calendars or journals.

 Description of Medication Adherence
Table 2 reports the tools used to measure adherence, the
definition of adherence used, the measurement time points
for each study and whether the measure was reported in
categorical or continuous format. Medication adherence ascer-
tainment and reporting were heterogeneous across studies. Of
the 17 studies, 7 used only an objective adherence measure, 6
used only self-reported measures, and 4 reported both types of
measures. Of the 11 studies that had an objective measure of
adherence, 6 used MEMS while 5 used pharmacy claims data
to capture adherence. The self-reported measures varied more
and included a number of validated tools to estimate mean
adherence or percent of subjects with adequate adherence over
a previous set of days that ranged from 4 to 30 days. Eleven
studies reported the adherence measures in categorical form
and 11 in continuous form, and 5 reported both types. The
median follow-up for the evaluation of adherence was
6 months IQR.4–10, 12, 13
Quality of Motivational Interviewing
Table 3 summarizes the training, fidelity assessment and
fidelity-based feedback reported by each study. These are
considered key quality metrics for MI.5 Ten studies reported
the amount of time dedicated to MI training at baseline, which
ranged from 4 to 40 h. Most studies reported approximately
24 h of training. Regarding MI fidelity assessment, 9 of the 17
studies used a validated assessment tool among a random
sample of encounters, and 3 described a similar process with-
out mentioning a specific tool. Ten of these studies reported
providing fidelity-based feedback and booster MI trainings.
Five studies described quality assurance methods that did
not directly assess the fidelity of the MI.
Meta-analysis results
Publication Bias. We did not detect publication bias using
Begg’s funnel plot, and the beta-coefficient of the regression
asymmetry was not significant (-0.009 with a p-value of 0.81).
Impact of MI on Medication Adherence
For studies reporting the proportion of patients with adequate
adherence (n=11) the pooled RR of being adherent for MI
was 1.17 (95 % CI 1.05–1.31; p<0.01) when compared to the
control group.
For studies reporting a continuous measure (n=11), the
SMD was 0.70 (95 % CI 0.15–1.25; p<0.01) for MI when
compared to the control group.

 There was statistical heterogeneity (I-squared >50 % and
p<0.01) for both types of adherence measures. The main
reason for the heterogeneity was the MI delivery mode as
reflected by its beta coefficient in the metaregression model
(0.11; 95 % CI 0.06–0.17, p<0.01).
The Effect of MI Intervention Characteristics
on Adherence
Table 4 summarizes the results of the subgroup analyses.
Individual and mixed MIs were not superior to the control
intervention at improving adherence. Phone-based MI im-
proved adherence measured categorically and group MI im-
proved adherence measured continuously. These latter analy-
ses had small between-studies variance in effect size compared
to telephonic continuous and group categorical measures that
had larger differences, although with the same directionality
(Fig. 2a and b).
MI was superior to the control group among studies that
used a fidelity assessment tool and reported continuous adher-
ence measures. Providing fidelity-based feedback was superi-
or among studies reporting categorical measures.

 Stratifying the analyses according to the background of the
interventionist revealed that MI improved adherence when
delivered by nurses or research assistants with no specific
degree. Interventions that used master level educators, psy-
chologists or pharmacists did not show a significant MI ef-
fect.17, 22, 24, 25
Duration of MI exposure did not impact adherence. Using
generalized least square regression, the exponentiated beta-
coefficient of change by tertiles of MI exposure was 0.90
(95 % CI 0.77–1.27; p=0.93).
Among studies reporting an objective measure of adher-
ence, the pooled RR of being adherent was 1.13 (95 % CI
1.01–1.28; p=0.03) for the MI intervention when compared to
the control group. The pooled RR of being adherent for MI
compared to the control intervention was 1.15 (95 % CI 1.03–
1.28; p=0.01) among studies that used self-reported scales to
ascertain adherence.
DISCUSSION
Our study reveals that MI improves medication adherence
particularly among minority populations; however, the analy-
sis of MI characteristics associated with this improvement had
inconsistent results. This was due to the variability in adher-
ence measures that required further stratification of the

 analyses and the small samples of many studies that led to
significant heterogeneity in effect size. MI characteristics as-
sociated with improved medication adherence were delivery
by nurses or research assistants, telephonic MI and fidelity-
based feedback among studies reporting categorical measures
and group MI and fidelity assessment among studies reporting
continuous measures.
Improving medication adherence is challenging given the
complexity of its determinants and the heterogeneous adher-
ence definitions.15, 40, 41 Minority and vulnerable populations
are at an even higher risk of non-adherence.42–44
MI has been effective at improving medication adherence;5
however, the characteristics associated with efficacy have not
been studied.33 This review suggests that primary care prac-
tices and community outreach clinics are effectively
implementing and testing MI interventions.34 However, we
found heterogeneity in delivery modes, number of training
hours, fidelity assessment and provision of feedback, MI
exposure time and outcome measurement.
When considering delivery modes, others had previously
found phone-based MI to be promising,35 but the heterogeneity
in quality and adherence measures limited their conclusions.
Our meta-analyses found phone-based MI to be superior to
usual care among RCTs only among studies reporting a cate-
gorical adherence measure, which had a more consistent effect
size. The significantly larger effect size of Solomon et al.,32
which reported a continuous measure, created heterogeneity
that led to nonsignificant results. Similar limitations occurred
in the in-person and group analyses in which Interian et al.19
and Holstad et al.26 also had larger effect sizes. It is important
to clarify the efficacy of different MI delivery modes36 since
they could improve MI’s cost-effectiveness and reach among
populations with access barriers. Solomon and Palacio et al.27,
32 used administrative pharmacy claims and a phone-based
delivery mode to identify and reach a large number of eligible
subjects over wide geographic areas. Group- or peer-led MI
could offer a more comfortable environment for subjects re-
luctant to participate in one-on-one sessions.37
The evaluation of fidelity has been considered a marker of
MI quality.5 Our study suggests that not evaluating MI fidelity
is associated with a lack of impact on adherence. A limitation
is that only a few studies did not report having fidelity assess-
ment. Interestingly, even when most studies assessed fidelity,
not many reported providing fidelity-based feedback, suggest-
ing a need to evaluate in more depth the mechanisms by which
fidelity improves the quality of MI.
As reported by others,3 level of education did not correlate
with MI efficacy as the counselors associated with improved
adherence had significantly different levels of education. This
highlights the importance of MI training and the need to
evaluate other innate counselors’ characteristics that may be
predictive of success. Similarly, total MI exposure time did not
correlate with MI efficacy. However, the impact of MI fre-
quency or overall program duration was not evaluated. More
studies need to evaluate the sustainability and the long-term
effect of MI.
Our study has several strengths. It furthers the knowledge
that MI is effective at improving medication adherence3 by
offering a rigorous evaluation of randomized control trials that
focus exclusively on MI. Prior adherence studies have faced
the challenge of short follow-up periods, low minority repre-
sentation and lack of objective measures of adherence.38, 39
The current review included studies with objective measures
of adherence, large proportion of black subjects, wider range
of follow-up and studies with repeated measures of adherence
that allowed evaluating a possible dose effect.45
Our study has several limitations. First, most of the studies
recruited black populations preferentially, and the percentage
of studies focusing on non-minority subjects was low. The
authors did not offer a rationale for the populations selected.
Second, most of the interventions targeted antiretroviral med-
ications limiting the generalizability of the results. However,
most of the non-HIV studies showed MI as superior to the
control group as well. Third, the power of our analyses was
limited by the small sample sizes of many studies and the small
number of studies in some of the subgroup analyses particu-
larly when the between-study variance was large. Fourth,
adherence measures were heterogeneous requiring stratifica-
tion for analyses. Fifth, the recruitment of subjects with ade-
quate baseline adherence could have impacted the effect size of
MI and finally the internal validity of the studies could be
threatened by quality issues such as large attrition rates, small
sample sizes and missing data. However, most studies did
report or conducted intention-to-treat analyses, used all data
available and had balanced groups by completion status.
In summary, MI improves self-reported and objective mea-
sures of adherence to chronic medications after different lengths
of exposure; however, the current evidence does not allow
identifying consistent predictors of success. Larger studies are
needed to confirm the efficacy of different delivery modes,
fidelity assessment and feedback among diverse populations
with a variety of chronic conditions. Efforts should be made to
standardize the monitoring of adherence to chronic medications.
