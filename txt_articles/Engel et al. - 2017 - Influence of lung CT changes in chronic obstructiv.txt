Abstract
Background
Changes in microbial community composition in the lung of patients suffering from moderate
to severe COPD have been well documented. However, knowledge about specific micro-
biome structures in the human lung associated with CT defined abnormalities is limited.
Methods
Bacterial community composition derived from brush samples from lungs of 16 patients suf-
fering from different CT defined subtypes of COPD and 9 healthy subjects was analyzed

Results
We could show that bacterial community composition in patients with changes in CT (either
airway or emphysema type changes, designated as severe subtypes) was different from
community composition in lungs of patients without visible changes in CT as well as from
healthy subjects (designated as mild COPD subtype and control group) (PC1, Padj = 0.002).
Higher abundance of Prevotella in samples from patients with mild COPD subtype and from
controls and of Streptococcus in the severe subtype cases mainly contributed to the separa-
tion of bacterial communities of subjects. No significant effects of treatment with inhaled glu-
cocorticoids on bacterial community composition were detected within COPD cases with
and without abnormalities in CT in PCoA. Co-occurrence analysis suggests the presence of
networks of co-occurring bacteria. Four communities of positively correlated bacteria were
revealed. The microbial communities can clearly be distinguished by their associations with
the CT defined disease phenotype.
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that CT detectable structural changes in the lung of COPD patients,
which we termed severe subtypes, are associated with alterations in bacterial communities,
which may induce further changes in the interaction between microbes and host cells. This
might result in a changed interplay with the host immune system.
Introduction
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic cough, increased
sputum production and dyspnoea. More than 3 million people died of COPD in 2012, approx-
imately 6% of all deaths globally [1]. Whereas in high-income countries COPD is primarily
caused by tobacco smoking, in low- and middle-income countries both indoor and outdoor
air pollution play an important role in disease etiology [1].
COPD is associated with chronic pulmonary inflammation, with exacerbations and comor-
bidity contributing to the severity in the course of disease [2]. The key pathophysiological
abnormalities in the lungs are small airway narrowing and fibrosis, emphysematous lung
destruction and mucus hypersecretion [2]. COPD is a very heterogeneous disease, with clinical
manifestations varying between individuals both in terms of presence and severity [3]. For
some years now, high resolution computed tomography (CT) has been used to evaluate struc-
tural changes in lungs of COPD patients, enabling the identification of COPD subtypes [4, 5].
These are rather attributed to structural changes in the lung than to severity of airflow obstruc-
tion. In general, decreased lung density corresponds to increased emphysema severity [6]
whereas airway wall thickening goes along with chronic bronchitis [7]. Thus, based on CT,
COPD subtypes have been defined: (I) the airway dominated subtype, characterized by high
percentage airway wall area and typically associated with chronic bronchitis [8], (II) the
emphysema dominated subtype, coming along with low lung density, and (III) cases without
changes in density and percentage wall area in CT [5]. This classification system has been used

 to differentiate specific features of COPD [9] and is recommended as a personalized approach
of treatment for patients [10].
It has been common opinion for decades, that healthy lungs are almost free of microbes
due to various mechanisms of pulmonary and mucociliary clearance [11] and cellular and
humoral immunity [12, 13]. It was considered that the bacterial microbiota observed in the
lung of individuals with diseases like COPD results from dysfunction of these described mech-
anisms [14]. Pathogenic bacteria were shown to evade or impair clearing mechanisms [15, 16],
and cigarette smoke has been described to exert a deleterious effect as well [17], facilitating
bacterial colonization of the lung.
With the emergence of cultivation-independent methods to study microbial diversity a
more multifaceted picture started to show up, changing from a pathogen dominated view
towards a perspective of a complex system with possible interactions between microbes as well
as microbes with the host [18, 19]. It is now generally agreed that the establishment of stable
and interacting communities of organisms can help to inhibit colonization by pathogens [20,
21]. However, changes in lung pathophysiology can shift the composition of the microbial
community. In the case of different COPD subtypes, this might not only impact the emergence
of single organisms like non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis [22]
but might also differentially influence bacterial community composition in general. Recent
studies described differences on the level of whole microbial community in lungs of patients
suffering from moderate to severe COPD, compared to healthy individuals [23, 24].
In this study we addressed the question of whether COPD sub-types, defined by quantita-
tive CT, are associated with lung microbiome changes. We postulated that differences in
emphysema and airway wall thickness are major factors triggering microbial community com-
position. Thus, we hypothesized that differences in the lung bacterial community composition
are observable (I) between COPD patients and controls or (II) between COPD patients with
and without CT abnormalities. To test our hypothesis, we compared lung microbial commu-
nity composition in COPD patients with or without structural lung changes detectable by
quantitative CT and a healthy control group. Samples were derived from participants of the
EvA (acronym for “emphysema vs. airway disease” in COPD) study [4]. Material was collected
by protected bronchial brushings gained during bronchoscopy. Lower airway microbiota com-
position was determined using a cultivation-independent barcoding approach. Changes in
bacterial community composition in lung samples obtained from our study participants were
assessed both on the level of individual taxa, as well as on the level of network structures.
Material and methods
Study population
Sixteen male and female, Caucasian patients between the age of 48 and 74 with COPD, mainly
stages 1 and 2 according to GOLD classification [25] and nine controls were selected from partic-
ipants from 4 European countries of the EvA study according to following criteria: >2 μg of total
DNA in combination with high percentage airway wall area or low lung density in CT for cases
[4]. Table 1 summarizes information of the study participants. Participants had a substantial
smoke exposure (Table 1) but all were ex-smokers at the time of sampling. Except for one case
they stopped smoking at least one year before the bronchoscopy procedure. None of the patients
received oral glucocorticoids, antibiotics or had an exacerbation during the preceding 2 months.
Nine of the cases received inhaled glucocorticoids in combination with long-acting beta-2 ago-
nists (LABA). Twelve of the cases showed abnormalities detected by quantitative computed
tomography (QCT), with underlying values for QCT indices of emphysema (lung densitometry
expressed as 15th percentile point) and airway wall geometry (percentage airway wall of the apical

 segment bronchus of the right upper lobe), being described in detail before [26]. In summary,
cases with detectable changes in CT either showed changes characteristic for airway-type COPD
with high percentage wall area (�69.3%WA) or those typical for emphysema-type COPD, char-
acterized by low density of the lung parenchyma (�-925.6 Hounsfield units (HU)) (S1 Table).
Four cases didn’t show CT detectable changes in the lung and were designated as mild subtypes
with low percentage wall area (<69.3%WA) and normal density (>-925.6 HU).
The study was approved by the local ethics and review boards at the participating centers:
Ethics Committee of Ferrara (Nr. 071195 (2007)), Medical Research Council, Scientific and
Research Committee (ETT-TUKEB, 22-278/2007-1018EKU), Leicestershire, Northampton-
shire and Rutland MREC (08/H0402/19), Ethics Committee of the Philipps-University of Mar-
burg (101/08, 04.07.2008) and all subjects provided written informed consent.
Lung material
Flexible bronchoscopy was performed after mild sedation in supine position. In the right upper
lobe segment bronchi S1, and its sub-segments were sampled with a protected brush (5mm
diameter at bristle level, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) via a nostril as described before [4].
Bronchial brushings were transferred into RNAprotect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) fluid imme-
diately, and all material was stored at -20˚C. DNA was extracted using the semi-automated Qia-
cube, AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) in the CEA DNA extraction unit (Centre National
de Ge
´notypage, Institut de Ge
´nomique, CEA, Evry, France). Quantity was determined in dupli-
cate, using the Quant-IT kits from Life Technologies (Carlsbord, California, US). Quality of
DNA was verified by ensuring its integrity in 0.5% agarose gels. Samples were selected for the
microbiome study if they contained more than 2 μg of total DNA with high integrity.
Pyrosequencing
Amplification of the V6–V9 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed according to Tim-
mers et al. [27]. Briefly, for PCR 16S rRNA gene targeting forward primer 926F (5´-AAACTY

 and reverse primer 630R (5´-CAKAAAGGAGGTGATCC-3´ [29]) attached to the Roche B
adapter were used. For multiplexing purposes each primer included a 10-nt barcode sequence.
Three independent PCRs were performed for each sample with the Fast Start High Fidelity PCR
System (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) containing 200ng of DNA and 0,3% (w/v) BSA with an
optimal annealing temperature of 50˚C and 36 cycles. Replicate PCR reactions were pooled
together and purified using QiaQuick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Addi-
tional purification was performed with Agencourt AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld,
Germany) as recommended in the 454 instructions for amplicon library preparation (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany). Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon library was performed on a
Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium system Pyrosequencer as recommended in the manufacturer’s
instructions (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Resulting sequences were processed using the ampli-
con signal processing pipeline of the Roche software for base calling, trimming of adaptors and
quality trimming with one modification in the quality filtering section, where “vfScanAllFlows”
was changed from “tionly” to “false” such that 3’ trimming for the Amplicon pipeline is activated
leading to fewer rejected reads.
Sequence data have been submitted to Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of NCBI (BioProject
ID: PRJNA296567).
Data analysis
Unassembled sequence reads in sff format where subjected to further quality checking using
mothur v.1.29.2 [30]. Briefly, after demultiplexing of the reads and trimming them to 720
flows, sequences where subjected to denoising (PyroNoise implemented in mothur). After
removal of reads shorter than 200nt or with more than seven homopolymers, sequences were
aligned against the Silva v102 compatible SSU reference alignment. For further reduction of
sequencing errors preclustering was applied which clusters sequences only differing in up to
two nucleotides. Chimera check against the Silva database was conducted applying Chimera
UCHIME, as implemented using the "chimera.uchime" command in mothur and chimeric
sequences were dismissed. To account for possible contamination bias, OTUs were first clus-
tered on 99% identity and all sequencing reads from OTUs that had a significant (P<0.05) and
negative spearman correlation with amplicon concentration in one of the three library amplifi-
cation runs were removed for further analysis as previously described [31]. The remaining
sequencing reads were subjected to a second run of the mothur software by clustering OTUs at
an identity cutoff of 95%. Subsequent classification of OTUs was performed using the RDP
trainset applying a bootstrap cutoff of 80%. For all OTUs that were unclassified on genus level
but classified on family level representative sequence reads were retrieved, automatically
aligned using SINA [32] and imported in ARB [33]. Maximum Likelihood Treeing algorithm
PhyML, embedded in ARB, was used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees of partial 16S rRNA
gene sequences of selected OTUs derived from this study and of reference organisms. All
OTUs that could be assigned to a genus using ARB were re-classified to the corresponding
genus.
Statistical analysis
Abundances of all OTUs that were classified on genus level were added to obtain the abun-
dance of their corresponding genus. Genera with less than 0.01% abundance within the total
number of samples were neglected. To visualize differences in community composition
between COPD subtypes, PCoA analysis was performed using Bray-Curtis distances [34] on
Hellinger transformed abundances. We observed a trend for differences in community com-
position between samples processed during summer and samples processed during winter

 (S1 Fig). To avoid systematic bias, reported P-values for comparisons of individual abun-
dances, diversity and principal coordinates were corrected for seasonal effects. This was
achieved by using the difference of the value under consideration and the median of this value
for all samples processed during winter or summer, respectively. For the estimation of diver-
sity in terms of species evenness and richness, we applied Pielou’s evenness [35] and the Chao
richness index [48]. In addition, rarefaction curves and PERMANOVA were computed using
the R package vegan (S2 Fig) [49]. To test for differences in abundances between binary meta-
variables, two-sided Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were applied. P-values of individual gen-
era and PERMANOVA analyses were adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hoch-
berg’s method [36]. Such P-values will be referred to as Padj throughout the manuscript. To
construct interaction networks of genera, we used the CCREPE method [37] with pairwise
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients for relative abundances of all genera larger than zero
in at least 5 samples. To obtain P-values we used 1000 random permutations and set an edge, if
P<0.05 and the correlation coefficient passed a threshold of 0.5. To account for differences
between samples processed during winter and summer, correlations were also computed for
abundances corrected for seasonal effects and all edges that did not remain significant were
removed from the initial network. Communities of correlated genera were then defined based
on the resulting connected components.
Results
After direct extraction of the DNA derived from bronchial brushings from patients suffering
from COPD stages 1 and 2 according to the GOLD classification, and from healthy subjects,
bacterial community composition was determined by 454 pyro-sequencing of 16S rRNA gene
amplification products. Sequencing resulted in 77515 chimera free, high-quality reads. After
removal of 16S rRNA sequences derived from mitochondria of epithelium cells of the lung
and of reads identified as potential PCR contaminations according to [31], numbers of reads
varied between 722 to 4789 reads per sample. To account for differences in the number of
sequencing reads, all libraries were subsampled to 722 reads and reads were clustered on 95%
sequence similarity level. This number of reads was sufficient to cover the majority of OTUs in
all samples as indicated by analysis of the individual rarefaction curves (S2 Fig). Samples with
less than 700 reads in total were discarded for the analysis. In total, 25 samples (9 samples from
healthy subjects and 16 from cases) were used for further analysis.
Bacterial community composition of the lung in healthy subjects and
COPD patients with and without CT detectable abnormalities
Our COPD patients group comprised cases with and without CT detectable lung changes. For
better readability we refer to mild COPD subtypes in the following for patients without QCT
detectable changes in lungs and to severe COPD subtypes for patients with QCT detectable
changes in lungs, deviating from the GOLD nomenclature of COPD patients. Such QCT
detectable abnormalities were either characterized by low lung density in CT, indicating
destruction of the lung parenchyma (emphysema), or airway type changes characterized by
high percentage wall area. We hypothesized, that changes in lung bacterial community compo-
sition might either be observable between COPD patients and controls or between cases with
compared to those without abnormalities in CTs (severe and mild subtype, respectively) and
controls. To test these hypotheses, bacterial community composition in lung samples of mild
and severe subtype COPD patients and controls was analyzed based on Principal Coordinate
Analysis (PCoA) (Fig 1A). While the latter indicated separation of communities of controls
and patients (principal coordinate (PC) 1, Padj = 0.014) (Fig 1B), no significant differences

 were observed based on PERMANOVA analysis (Padj = 0.11). Since changes in QCT reflect
structural changes of the lung and since these changes may be more important to microbial
composition than air flow parameters, we compared microbial patterns in cases with CT
changes and individuals with normal lung structure (cases without CT changes and controls).
This analysis showed, that the main difference in community composition was observed
between severe versus mild subtype cases and controls in the first principal coordinate (PC1,
Padj = 0.0074) (Fig 1C) and in PERMANOVA (Padj = 0.006) analyses. Moreover, bacterial com-
munities derived from lungs of mild subtype COPD patients closely resembled those of con-
trols (P = 0.60). Furthermore, communities derived from severe subtype COPD patients could
be separated from controls (Padj = 0.0048) (S4 Fig). The focus of the following analyses was
therefore on the comparisons between COPD patients showing visible changes in CT desig-
nated as severe subtype cases with those without changes and controls (designated as mild sub-
type and control group).
We hypothesized, that changes in the structure of the lung might coincide with differences
in diversity or richness of harbored bacterial communities. Thus, evenness and richness of
community compositions was compared between severe vs mild subtype cases and controls.
No significant differences were observed between groups (P = 0.32 and 0.5, respectively) (Fig
2A and 2B). The composition of bacterial communities on family level, showed a large vari-
ability between the individual subjects (Fig 2C). However, representatives of Veillonellaceae
and Streptococcaceae were dominating the microbial communities in most samples, summing
up to more than 50% of bacterial families present in the majority of samples of cases as well as
controls. Frequently detected bacterial families, although less dominant, were Neisseriaceae,
Pasteurellaceae and Fusobacteriaceae (Fig 2C).
Differences in individual genera between severe vs mild subtype cases
and controls
To identify genera which contribute to the separation of severe versus mild subtype cases
and the control group, all genera were screened for significant differences between the two
groups of individuals (Fig 3 and S5 Fig). Streptococcus (P = 0.03) (Fig 1A), Granulicatella
(P = 0.018), a Neisseriaceae genus (P = 0.002), and Diaphorobacter (P = 0.02) showed signifi-
cantly higher abundance in severe subtype COPD cases (Fig 3A and S5 Fig). In the mild
subtype and control group significantly higher abundances of genera Prevotella (P = 0.008)
(Fig 1), Solobacterium (P = 0.018), Parvimonas (P = 0.0038), Selenomonas (P = 0.013), Fuso-
bacterium (P = 0.014), Oribacterium (P = 0.042), and a Ruminococcaceae genus (P = 0.014)
were contributing to the observed differences between the groups (Fig 3B and S5 Fig). How-
ever, after multiple testing corrections no significant associations remained. Thus, above
described findings should be considered as trends, which have to be confirmed in further
studies.
Influence of medication on microbial community composition in the lung
of COPD patients
58% of the severe subtype COPD patients and 50% of the mild subtype COPD patients
received Glucocorticoid/LABA (GC) medication by inhalation (Table 1). We hypothesized
that GC medication might exert an effect on bacterial community composition. However, no
significant effects of GC treatment on bacterial community composition were detected for
cases with and those without GC treatment in PCoA (P = 0.19) (S3 Fig). Additionally, we
tested for an influence of GC treatment on the abundance of individual genera (S6 Fig). Mem-
bers of Parvimonas showed lower abundances in patients receiving GC treatment (P = 0.0071).

 For representatives of Solobacterium (P = 0.054) and Fusobacterium (P = 0.065) a slight trend
towards reduced abundance in samples derived from GC treated patients was observable, but
is missing significance. This influence of GC treatment on individual genera might also have
contributed to the observed differences for the respective genera in the comparison between
severe versus the mild subtype cases and control group (S5 Fig).

 Bacterial networks in the lung
On basis of the observed differences in community composition between severe vs mild
COPD subtypes and controls, we aimed at assessing associations of bacteria in the lung. Partic-
ularly, we were interested how differences in abundances between severe versus mild subtype
cases and controls influence associations within microbiota. To address this question, a

 microbial correlation network was estimated based on relative abundances of bacterial genera.
This approach revealed four communities of positively correlated bacteria (Fig 4A).
The microbial communities can clearly be distinguished by their associations with disease
phenotype. While all genera in three of the communities (marked in blue, green and yellow)
showed a trend for increased abundances in the mild subtype cases and controls, all genera in

 the fourth community showed the opposite trend (red community). Among the communities
with increased abundances in individuals of the mild subtype and control group one small
community (marked in green) consisted of members of Bacteroidetes (S7 Fig). It included Pre-
votella which was indicative for the separation of groups in PCoA (Fig 1A). The largest com-
munity (blue) harbored mainly representatives of Firmicutes beside genera of Bacteroidetes,
Tenericutes, Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria (S7 Fig). Many of the genera showed significantly
increased abundances in the mild subtype cases and controls compared to severe subtype cases
(S5 Fig). In contrast, the cluster marked in red, harbored genera predominantly detected in
severe subtype cases (Fig 4A). This cluster is composed of members of Firmicutes, Actinobac-
teria and Proteobacteria (S7 Fig) and included the genus Streptococcus which was indicative for
the separation of groups in PCoA (Fig 1A). Overall, clustering of genera into communities
indicated that co-occurrence relationships were strongly influenced by differences in microbial
abundances between severe subtype versus mild subtype cases and controls. Different struc-
tural states of the lung favored different clusters of genera. Further comparison of correlation
patterns between community members reveals co-exclusion relationships between communi-
ties containing genera that have increased abundances in severe subtype cases and the commu-
nity containing genera that have increased abundances in the mild subtype and controls (Fig
4B).

 Discussion
The current microbiota analysis was performed on samples obtained from the EvA study [4].
This study defined subtypes of COPD using CT image analysis of lung density for determina-
tion of the degree of emphysema and airway wall thickness as a measure of bronchitis. We
were interested in early changes in bacterial communities during disease development in
COPD, with special emphasis on interrelation of COPD subtypes with and without abnormali-
ties in CT and changes in microbial community composition.
Microbial community composition in the lung of COPD patients
Differences in bacterial community composition of the lung were observed between patients
with severe subtypes of COPD compared to that of controls. However, bacterial communities
derived from lungs of mild subtype COPD patients clustered mainly with those derived from
healthy controls. Several studies reported contamination of sputum as a measure for lung
microbial communities with upper airway microbiota, and thus, higher diversity in these sam-
ples or even day to day variation in absence of clinical changes can be expected [38, 39]. In our
study protected specimen brushes introduced through the nose were used for sampling. This
sampling technique not only minimizes contamination of lung derived samples with bacteria
from the upper airways, but provides samples being derived from the interface of human and
environment and thus targets those organisms which are in tight interplay with the human
cells and immune system. In our study sampling was performed in the right upper lobe. Dick-
son et al. [40] could show that right upper lobe microbiota more closely resembled that of the
upper respiratory tract, than that from more distant lung regions like middle lobe and lingual.
Thus, our detection of typical representative genera of the upper respiratory tract like Veillo-
nella, Oribacterium or Catonella [41] support their findings [40]. For patients with severe lung
indispositions partly accompanied by exacerbations, differences in microbial community com-
position have been described before: in a study including 5 COPD patients and 11 cases with
asthma, bacterial communities clustered together but differed in composition from communi-
ties of healthy controls [24]. However, COPD patients examined in this study have a much
lower average percent of FEV1 predicted value (51,2%) [24] compared to participants of our
study (Table 1). Also in another study composition of microbial community derived from
lungs of patients suffering from moderate to severe COPD differed from that of the control
group [23]. Sze and coworkers could show an increased diversity and significantly different
community structures of bacteria derived from lung tissue of patients suffering from COPD
GOLD stage 4 compared to controls [42]. However, none of the studies mentioned above,
focused on the associations of COPD subtypes based on CT detectable changes in lungs of
affected subjects with bacterial community composition, as performed in our study. Detection
of shifts in community composition of COPD cases with detected abnormalities in CT in our
study suggests that changes in microbial colonization of the lungs of COPD patients already
occur early, before meaningful impairment of the health status starts. Also Sze et al. [43] were
able to detect early changes by a decreased abundance of GD1-positive Lactobacillus in lungs
of GOLD stage 1 and 2 COPD patients compared to controls, although on genus level Lactoba-
cillus showed no differences between groups. However, changes like this are not detectable in
studies based on 16S rRNA gene fragment analyses alone, given the missing resolution of 16S
rRNA genes to strain level. In lungs of COPD GOLD stage 4 patients a shift to an increased
abundance towards Proteobacteria could be detected within harbored microbial communities
[44, 45]. In our severe subtype cases, a trend in this direction was observed with the higher
abundance of Diaphorobacter or Neisseriaceae genus (Fig 3) contributing to the trend. More-
over, for cases with detected abnormalities in CT the shift towards lower abundance of

 Bacteroidales [24] and higher prevalence of Lactobacillales [23] detected in lung derived com-
munities of GOLD stage 2 and 3 COPD cases was confirmed by data from our study. However,
comparisons among different studies have to be dealt with caution, since different regions of
the 16S rRNA gene as well as different sequencing platforms applied were shown to lead to
slight differences in detected community composition [46, 47].
Bacterial community structure and abnormalities in lung as detected by
CT
Data from our study revealed differences in the composition of the lung microbiome of
patients suffering from subtypes of COPD, that appear to correspond to CT-detectable
changes like percentage airway wall area or development of emphysema in the diseased lung.
It has been shown before, that these CT detectable changes involve physiological changes in
the lung. In lungs of COPD patients with chronic bronchitis (cases with increased percentage
airway wall area) reduced airway surface liquid leads to inefficient mucus clearance by reduced
action of cilia of epithelial cells. This results in increased mucus adhesion and thus facilitates
bacterial infections [48]. As a consequence of higher viscosity of mucus, gas diffusion is ham-
pered. Also during emphysematous lung states gas diffusion is impeded, due to trapping of air.
We hypothesize, that this might be an explanation for the observation of the increased abun-
dance of typical bacterial genera like Neisseria in our study, that need elevated levels of CO2 for
growth and are commensals of mucous membranes [49].
We hypothesize, that Prevotella may influence community composition and inflammation
in the lung by exhibiting anti-inflammatory properties in mixed bacterial communities. Sev-
eral different Prevotella species have been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine produc-
tion induced by other Gram negative bacteria in dendritic cells [50]. Similar effects have been
demonstrated in mouse models with an intrinsic toleration of Prevotella by the respiratory
immune system due to only weak induction of airway inflammation [51]. Following this line the
reduction of Prevotella in COPD disease might favour inflammation due to the absence of the
potentially immunosuppressive Prevotella species, finally promoting wall thickening or emphy-
sema. In contrast to findings using brush samples from severe subtypes of COPD cases in this
study, and in lung specimens of explanted lungs of GOLD 4 COPD patients [52], Segal et al [53]
described a correlation of Prevotella abundance with enhanced BAL inflammatory cells and eNO
in asymptomatic smoking and non-smoking individuals. Pathogenicity of Prevotella, in particu-
lar P. intermedia has been described before for oral samples [54]. It could be shown, that for
these pathogenic Prevotella the potential of invasion in epithelial cells is an important virulence
factor [55]. However, this ability is obviously strain specific [55, 56]. Insight into the properties
of Prevotella detected in higher abundance in the mild subtype and control group in this study
would need further research with a good resolution of Prevotella to strain level and a metage-
nomics approach to allow conclusions about functional characteristics of Prevotella strains pres-
ent in the lung.
Influence of medication on microbial community composition in lung of
cases
Some of our patients (9 out of 16) applied inhaled glucocorticoids (GC), all of them in combina-
tion with long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and 70% also with long-acting muscarinic antagonists
(LAMA). No significant effects of GC treatment on overall bacterial community composition
could be detected for cases with and without GC treatment in PCoA, but a possible, slight impact
on few single genera was observed. As it has long been shown that glucocorticoids influence anti-
microbial activity of macrophages [57] and impact the extent of inflammation [58] the application

 of inhaled glucocorticoids can impact microbial community composition. In addition LABA,
which is applied to cause bronchodilation, modifies the lung by inhibition of airway smooth-mus-
cle cell proliferation and inflammatory mediator release, as well as stimulation of mucociliary
transport [59]. In contrast to our findings, an earlier study [23] reported separation of bacterial
communities of GOLD 2 and 3 COPD patients using inhaled corticosteroid from that of non-
users based on their composition. The contrasting response pattern in our study could be related
to the fact that users of inhaled corticosteroids were harbored in all COPD subtypes present in
this study. It could already be shown in a study concerning the impact of combined corticosteroid
and LABA treatment in patients suffering from different COPD subtypes, that treatment differen-
tially exerts effects in sub-types of COPD patients. Only low improvements were observed during
treatment of emphysema-type patients (characterized by low lung density in CT, included in our
severe subtype, S1 Table) and highest improvements for the obstruction dominant subgroup
(included in our severe subtype with high percentage wall area, S1 Table) [60]. Mild subtypes
showed intermediate improvements [60]. Thus, given the heterogeneity of our study group, dif-
ferential effects of GC on individuals can also be expected in our study. Only few bacterial genera
were affected by glucocorticoid/ LABA medication throughout all these subtypes in our study.
However, we cannot exclude that weak differences were masked due to small group sizes of 9
patients compared to 7 patients without GC treatment, resulting in a low power of resolution.
Network structure
In our study co-occurrence analysis revealed the presence of clusters of co-occurring bacteria
in the lungs of study participants, strongly influenced by differences in microbial abundances
between severe versus mild subtype cases and controls. It is well accepted that composition of
bacterial communities is influenced by positive (this might be mutualism or commensalism)
as well as negative relationships (i.e. parasitism, competition) between contributing microor-
ganisms in several organs of the human body [37]. The lung is a niche, where bacteria face
limited supply of nutrients, influence of the host immune system, oxidative stress, as well as
the clearance mechanisms of the host. Thus, interactions between bacteria can be expected,
enabling and facilitating the colonization of the lung. Co-occurrence analysis revealed the
presence of a large cluster of co-occurring bacteria showing higher abundances in the lungs of
mild subtype cases and controls (Fig 4A, blue). In this cluster Fusobacterium is included,
which was described before as part of the lung core microbiome [61]. Fusobacterium enables
adherence between different sorts of cells of human and bacterial origin, which otherwise
would not be able to interact [62]. This ability might help during colonization of the lung. On
the one hand, various subspecies of this organism show the ability to effectively adhere to
human epithelial cells [63, 64]. On the other hand, a high capability to form co-aggregates with
diverse Gram+ and Gram- bacterial species in co-aggregation tests have been shown [65].
Thus, it might be hypothesized, that representatives of Fusobacterium act as interconnectors
between human and bacterial cells in the lung, too. Finally, Fusobacterium is also supporting
the growth of anaerobic organisms in oxygenated environments [66, 67]. This ability might be
of increased importance in an aerated habitat like the lung which might promote the observed
co-occurrence of Fusobacterium with representatives of Lachnospiraceae genera Catonella and
Moryella, which have been described to be strictly anaerobic [68].
Another cluster of associated bacteria harbours Porphyromonas and Prevotella (Fig 4A,
associated bacteria marked in green). For these species the ability to form heterotrophic bio-
films by co-aggregation has been demonstrated, showing an intra-species variability in the co-
aggregation of the partners [69]. During co-aggregations an increase in biomass of participat-
ing partners was detected [69]. This ability was suggested to promote persistence of both

 species in the oral habitat. Detected co-occurrence of these two genera in our study may in
some way hint to similar capabilities of involved species. We hypothesize that also in the lung
the ability to co-aggregate offers advantages for involved partners to compete. However, fur-
ther studies using metagenomics approaches and single cell genomics will be needed to allow
conclusions about functional traits and to go beyond the 16S rRNA gene fragment based solely
associative findings of this study.
Limitations of the study
Several groups reported specific bacterial DNA contamination of extraction and sequencing
kits [70], reagents [71] or solutions [72] in 16S rRNA gene targeting next generation as well as
metagenomic shotgun sequencing studies [73]. Different lots of an extraction kit harbored the
same predominantly contaminating genera, but differed in genera detected in low prevalence
[70]. The influence of contamination on high bacterial biomass containing samples has been
described to be negligible. However, low bacterial biomass samples are prone to be influenced
by bacterial contamination of reagents and kits [70–72]. In non-immunocompromised indi-
viduals the lung is a niche with low bacterial load. In this study negative controls were not
included. Therefore, reads from contaminating bacteria were probably generated in our
sequencing runs. In the study of Glassing et al. [70] more than 80 genera with far more than
100 tentative species have been detected as contaminants of different kits, most of them in low
abundance. Moreover, the study of Segal et al. [72] described reads with similarity to Strepto-
coccus thermophilus as contaminants, whereas Streptococcus mitis affiliated reads were detected
as part of the microbial community harbored in supraglottic and lung samples. Thus, extract-
ing all contaminating genera present in contaminant databases is no option, as contamination
is very specific to the kits used as well as species or even strain specific. To account for this
problem, we tested our sequencing reads according to the method described by Jervis-Bardy
et al. [31]. These authors could show that relative abundance of OTUs identified as potential
reagent contamination showed a strong inverse correlation with amplicon concentration allow-
ing for objective removal. Adaption of their method to our sequencing evaluation workflow
resulted in the detection of several OTUs as potential contaminants and removal of 2512 corre-
sponding reads prior to analyses. Although it cannot be fully excluded that a subset of non-con-
taminating OTUs by chance show the same inverse correlation behavior as contaminating
OTUs and is thus false positive, it is an appropriate method to account for contamination
within our context. Additionally to exclude potential low abundant contamination of samples
in our study, which might not be detectable with above described method, we neglected genera
with less than 0.01% abundance within the total number of samples.
The restricted number of subjects per COPD subtype (12 for the severe subtype and four
for the mild subtype) hindered the statistically valid detection of differences between COPD
subtypes at the genus level. After rigorously correcting for multiple testing, no significant asso-
ciations remained for subtype discriminating genera. Thus, described findings should be con-
sidered as trends, which have to be confirmed in further studies. Some of our findings hint
towards differences in bacterial community composition in the lung, comparing subjects with
emphysema and airway dominated severe COPD subtypes. However, with subject numbers as
low as 4, the statistical power for presentation of results at level of significance was too low.
Thus, potential differences have to be elucidated in larger studies with more balanced numbers
of samples per COPD subgroup.
Finally, with the approach used, based on the analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments it is not
possible to provide data on the functional traits of the bacterial genera being present in the
communities. Moreover, resolution to strain level is not possible, thus requiring validation of

 our findings based on studies applying meta- and single-cell genomic approaches as well as on
determination of host derived effectors of the innate, humoral immune system.
Conclusion
This study revealed changes in lung microbial community composition in GOLD stage 1 and
2 COPD cases with abnormalities in CT. We could show that lung community composition in
COPD patients without abnormalities in CT resembles that of the control group, whereas,
communities of patients with abnormalities in CT were significantly different. Our approach
using community detection in association networks of bacteria hints to the presence of differ-
ent communities of associated bacteria in the lung.
Our results suggest the presence of networks of associated bacteria, which are shifting,
depending on changes in the lung. These shifts might lead to a dysbiosis in the lung with
increasing severity of the disease which, at the end, might then result in altered susceptibility
to exacerbation events, as well as responsiveness towards medical treatment.
Larger group sizes with a higher depth of sequencing will allow confirmation of our trends.
Analyses of samples applying sequencing techniques that produce higher read lengths like Pac-
Bio [74] will allow getting a better phylogenetic resolution of our initial findings and enable
deeper insights into community composition. Also a simultaneous acquisition of individual
host derived factors, like inflammatory cells, inflammatory mediators or protease/anti-protease
activity together with microbial community analyses is desirable. This would allow conclusions
on immunological processes in the host and enable getting a deeper insight into interactions
between innate and adaptive inflammatory immune responses on the one hand and microbial
community composition on the other hand, both steering changes during COPD progression
in lung. Finally, detection of spatial arrangements of bacteria in relation to sites of inflammation
in the lung would be eligible to allow conclusions about interference of bacteria with the lung
epithelium.
