Morbid attraction 
to leopard urine 
in Toxoplasma-
infected 
chimpanzees

Parasites are sometimes capable of 
inducing phenotypic changes in their 
hosts to improve transmission [1]. 
Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan that 
infects a broad range of warm-blooded 
species, is one example that supports 
the so-called ‘parasite manipulation 
hypothesis’: it induces modifi
 cations 
in rodents’ olfactory preferences, 
converting an innate aversion for cat 
odor into attraction and probably 
favoring trophic transmission to feline 
species, its only defi
 nitive hosts [2]. In 
humans, T. gondii induces behavioral 
modifi
 cations such as personality 
changes, prolonged reaction times and 
decreased long-term concentration 
[3]. However, modern humans are not 
suitable intermediate hosts because 
they are no longer preyed upon by 
felines. Consequently, behavioral 
modifi
 cations in infected people 
are generally assumed to be side 
effects of toxoplasmosis or residual 
manipulation traits that evolved in 
appropriate intermediate hosts. An 
alternative hypothesis, however, states 
that these changes result from parasite 
manipulative abilities that evolved 
when human ancestors were still under 
signifi
 cant feline predation [3,4]. As 
such, T. gondii also alters olfactory 
preferences in humans; infected men 
rate cat urine, but not tiger urine, as 
pleasant while non-infected men do not 
[5]. To unravel the origin of Toxoplasma-
induced modifi
 cations in humans, 
we performed olfactory tests on a 
living primate still predated by a feline 
species. We found in our closest relative, 
the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes 
troglodytes), that Toxoplasma-
infected (TI) animals lost their innate 
aversion towards the urine of leopards 
(Panthera pardus), their only natural 
predator. By contrast, we observed 
no clear difference in the response 
of TI and Toxoplasma-non-infected 
(TN) animals towards urine collected 
from other defi
 nitive feline hosts that 
chimpanzees do not encounter in 
nature. Although the adaptive value of 
parasitically induced behavior should be 
assessed carefully, we suggest that the 
behavioral modifi
 cation we report could 
increase the probability of chimpanzee 
predation by leopards for the parasite’s 
own benefi
 t. This possible parasite 
adaptation would hence suggest that 
Toxoplasma-induced modifi
 cations in 
modern humans are an ancestral legacy 
of our evolutionary past.
We performed collective olfactory 
tests on 33 chimpanzees (9 TI and 
24 TN), living in fi
 ve captive groups in

Gabon. We conducted three 20-minute 
sessions per group (99 individual tests). 
To avoid mixing different olfactory 
cues, we presented one type of urine 
at a time, in random order: human 
urine, leopard urine, or urine from 
either tigers (P
. tigris) or lions (P
. leo), 
neither of which is a natural predator 
of chimpanzees. Indeed, tigers are 
Asiatic felines, and lions never lived in 
tropical rainforests, the natural habitat 
of chimpanzees. Using General(ized) 
Linear Mixed Models controlling for 
other fi
 xed effects (individual rank and 
sex, and session number) and random 
effects (individual, group and session 
identities), we analyzed both the 
frequency of olfactory investigations 
performed towards a urine source 
(sniffi
 ng and licking) and the occurrence 
of approaches within a 1 meter radius 
from a urine source (scan sampling: 
‘0’ if absent and ‘1’ if present; see 
Supplemental Experimental Procedures 
in the Supplemental Information). 
The interaction between the urine’s 
origin and the chimpanzee’s parasite 
status signifi
 cantly infl
 uenced both 
variables (Table S1A,B: investigations, 
F 
= 
4.21 and p 
= 
0.02; approaches, 
F 
= 
10.22 and p 
< 
0.001). First, TN 
chimpanzees investigated leopard 
urine less frequently than human urine, 
as expected if chimpanzees avoid 
their predator based on odorant cues 
(Table S2A and Figure 1A; Difference 
of Least Square Means [DLSM]: 
p 
= 
0.04). By contrast, TI chimpanzees 
both investigated and approached 
leopard urine more frequently than 
did TN individuals (Table S2A,B and 
Figure 1A,B; DLSM for investigations, 
p 
= 
0.008; for approaches, p 
= 
0.003). 
Surprisingly, TI animals tended to 
investigate more, but did not approach 
more frequently, urine collected 
from felines that are not their natural 
predators (Table S2A and Figure 1A,B) 
than TN chimpanzees did.
Even though our study is correlative 
and a pre-existing recklessness in 
TI animals may increase parasite 
encounter probability, several 
experimental studies have shown 
that a disruption of fear in infected 
rodents was directly caused by 
T. gondii, possibly through an 
epigenetic mechanism [6]. We therefore 
hypothesize that chimpanzees’ 
behavioral modifi
 cations are a 
consequence, not a cause, of 
parasitism. Toxoplasma-induced 
changes could, however, result from 
side effects of infection. For example, 
T. gondii forms cysts in the brain 
[7], possibly to escape the host’s 
immune system, and these cysts 
could cause, in turn, coincidental 
behavioral alterations in the host. 
However, this hypothesis fails to 
explain the increased attraction of TI 
animals towards leopard urine alone. 
Before concluding that parasitically 
induced behavior is a manipulated 
trait, several criteria need to be met 
[8]. In our case, providing formal proof 
that TI chimpanzees are preyed upon 
more than TN individuals, a fi
 nding 
that would strongly suggest parasite 
adaptation (sensu [1]), is impossible. 
Nevertheless, we hypothesize that 
behavioral modifi
 cations observed in TI 
chimpanzees could increase parasite 
fi
 tness. This hypothesis is supported 
by the observation that leopards are 
responsible for an estimated individual 
predation risk of 30% per year in 
some populations of chimpanzees [9]. 
Furthermore, our own results showed 
that TN chimpanzees avoid leopard 
urine more than human urine. Finally, 
since leopards urine-mark their territory, 
a decreased avoidance of leopard urine 
in the wild may therefore increase the 
probability of prey–predator encounter. 
Our study fuels an ongoing debate 
on the origin of Toxoplasma-induced 
behavior in humans. As feline predation 
pressure is virtually absent in modern 
humans, manipulation of a dead-end host 
such as our species should no longer 
benefi
 t T. gondii. However, hominids have 
long coexisted with large carnivores and 
were preyed upon at rates comparable 
to those for extant primates [10]. When 
feline predation was still an evolutionary 
driver in our lineage, possible 
manipulative abilities may have evolved 
because early hominids were suitable 
intermediate hosts. Future research 
should focus on a wider range of species 
undergoing different predation pressures 
to shed light on the evolutionary history of 
T. gondii and unravel the circumstances 
under which host behavioral traits 
become extended phenotypes of 
parasites.
