Introduction
The HIV-specific T cell response is critical to control HIV replication 
following infection (1, 2). However, for a variety of reasons, includ-
ing the insufficient generation and maintenance of functional T cell 
responses, T cells are incapable of clearing the infection (3, 4). T cell 
dysfunction due to cellular exhaustion arises during many chronic 
infections in response to ongoing antigen stimulation, which results 
in the expression of immunosuppressive factors including PD-1, 
TIM-3, and IL-10 (5–8). In addition to immunosuppressive mech-
anisms, chronic inflammation and immune activation may further 
foster T cell exhaustion, limiting control of infection (9, 10). In fact, 
chronic immune activation is a hallmark of HIV infection, and high-
er levels of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are directly correlated 
with accelerated disease progression (11–14). Yet, the mechanisms 
underlying the emergence of T cell exhaustion and global immune 
activation due to chronic HIV infection have yet to be defined.
Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic type I inter-
feron (IFN-I) signaling enhances immune activation and drives 
the expression of multiple inhibitory factors that inhibit antiviral 
immunity and contribute to viral persistence (5, 10, 15–17). IFN-I 
is critical for the initiation of antiviral responses, and blockade 
of IFN-I signaling during acute SIV infection in rhesus macaques 
resulted in a loss of antiviral control culminating in increased 
SIV replication, enhanced CD4 T cell depletion, and accelerat-
ed disease progression (15, 18). Conversely, the same study also 
found that treatment with recombinant IFN-α (IFN-α2a) led to 
an IFN-desensitized state and accelerated disease progression 
despite initial heightened resistance to infection (15, 18, 19). Pre-
vious clinical trials treating HIV patients with pegylated IFN-α2a 
exhibited limited antiviral effects and no correlation between 
viral load decrease and plasma IFN-α2a concentration (15, 19–21). 
These results highlight the complex roles that IFN-I plays during 
antiviral responses. Importantly, the effects of IFN-I signaling on 
T cell responses and HIV replication, once persistent infection is 
established, at a time when the antiviral roles of IFN-I have been 
suggested to be blunted (22, 23), remain unclear.
Results
Expression of exhaustion and activation markers is elevated in T 
cells in chronically infected humanized BLT mice. Cellular immune 
responses in HIV-infected NOD SCID common γ chain–deficient 
(NSG)/humanized bone marrow–human fetal liver and thymus 
(BLT) mice (NSG-BLT mice) have been recently demonstrated to 
closely mirror those in humans (4, 24–30), making it a good mod-
el to study HIV immune pathology and immune-based therapies 
in vivo. To investigate immune activation and immune exhaus-
tion in vivo, we generated NSG-BLT mice (for representative flow 
plots of human lymphocytes, see Supplemental Figure 1; supple-
mental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/
JCI89488DS1) and mock-infected or infected mice with HIV-1 
and followed the expression of the immune inhibitory receptors 
PD-1 and TIM-3 and the activation markers HLA-DR and CD38 
on CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (for representative staining of the mark-
ers, see Supplemental Figure 2). During chronic HIV infection 
(9–13 weeks), HLA-DR, CD38, PD-1, and TIM-3 were all elevated 
on human T cells, particularly on human CD8+ T cells, compared 
with T cells from uninfected mice generated from the same donor 
tissues (Figure 1, A–D, and Supplemental Figure 2A), indicating 
Chronic immune activation, immunosuppression, and T cell exhaustion are hallmarks of HIV infection, yet the mechanisms 
driving these processes are unclear. Chronic activation can be a driving force in immune exhaustion, and type I interferons 
(IFN-I) are emerging as critical components underlying ongoing activation in HIV infection. Here, we have tested the effect 
of blocking IFN-I signaling on T cell responses and virus replication in a murine model of chronic HIV infection. Using HIV-
infected humanized mice, we demonstrated that in vivo blockade of IFN-I signaling during chronic HIV infection diminished 
HIV-driven immune activation, decreased T cell exhaustion marker expression, restored HIV-specific CD8 T cell function, and 
led to decreased viral replication. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) in combination with IFN-I blockade accelerated viral suppression, 
further decreased viral loads, and reduced the persistently infected HIV reservoir compared with ART treatment alone. Our data 
suggest that blocking IFN-I signaling in conjunction with ART treatment can restore immune function and may reduce viral 
reservoirs during chronic HIV infection, providing validation for IFN-I blockade as a potential therapy for HIV infection.

T cell activation, we then measured whether such improvement 
in CD8 T cell responses and overall immune activation reduction 
could lead to change in viral load. Interestingly, we found that 
IFNR blockade, but not isotype treatment, led to a reduction in 
virus loads when administered during the chronic stage of infec-
tion (Figure 4A).
Concurrent IFNR blockade and antiretroviral therapy result in 
faster viral suppression. In all, blocking IFN-I signaling during per-
sistent viral infection can have multiple beneficial effects on immune 
responses and can lead to decreased HIV replication. To investigate 
the impact of blocking IFN-I signaling in conjunction with com-
bination antiretroviral therapy (ART), humanized BLT mice were 
infected with HIVNL4-3HSA, which is a replication-competent virus that 
contains a cell surface–expressed reporter gene (murine heat sta-
ble antigen [HSA]) whose detection is indicative of viral expression 
(5, 10, 15–17). Importantly, HIVNL4-3HSA replicates with kinetics and 
titers analogous to those of the parental HIVNL4-3 in BLT mice (15, 
18). Eight weeks after HIV infection, mice were treated with a daily 
regimen of ART (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF]/ Emtricit-
abine [FTC]/raltegravir)  for 3 weeks (n = 9), and another set of mice 
were treated with daily ART for 3 weeks including 1 week of concur-
rent IFNR blockade during ART treatment (n = 6). ART treatment 
reduced IFN-I signaling, and the combination of ART treatment 
with IFNR blockade resulted in a greater reduction in IFN-I signaling 
as shown by decreased expression of the ISGs MX1 and OAS1 (Figure 
4B). Combined treatment of mice with ART and IFNR blockade also 
further reduced TIM-3 expression on CD8 cells to levels similar to 
those in uninfected controls (Figure 3C). When stimulated with PMA/ 
ionomycin, treatment with either IFNR blockade or ART alone 
restored CD8 production of cytokines, and CD8 cells from mice 
cotreated with ART and IFNR blockade produced a further improved 
level of cytokines that was similar to that in uninfected controls (Figure 
3D). This suggests an additive benefit of ART and IFN-I blockade. ART 
treatment alone resulted in significant reduction of viral loads within 
3 weeks of treatment compared with untreated infection (Figure 4E). 
Interestingly, blocking IFNR for 1 week in combination with ART led 
to a significantly greater reduction in HIV viral loads compared with 
IFNR blockade or ART alone (Figure 4, E and F, which shows viral load 
fold change after each treatment). This suggests that concurrent IFNR 
blockade during ART treatment of chronic HIV infection is beneficial 
to accelerate control of the virus.
Concurrent IFNR blockade and ART reduce levels of reactivatable 
viral reservoirs. The persistently infected, activation-inducible HIV 
reservoir represents a major obstacle to eradication. To determine 
how IFNR blockade affects the activation-inducible HIV reservoir, 
splenocytes were harvested from HIVNL4-3HSA-infected mice treated 
with isotype antibody, anti-IFNR blocking antibody, ART, or ART 
with anti-IFNR blocking antibody. HIV reporter gene–expressing 
(i.e., productively infected) cells were removed by sorting, leaving 
only cells not expressing virus (15, 18, 19). We then measured HIV 
DNA copies from half of these cells and reactivated the other half 
with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation, in the presence of the pro-
tease inhibitor indinavir to prevent subsequent viral infection and 
spread in the culture. After 3 days, supernatant from the reactiva-
tion culture was collected for p24 ELISA assay to measure the pro-
duction of viral particles and HIV RNA expression (15, 19–21) (for 
schematic outline of the viral reactivation assay, see Supplemental 
ongoing CD8+ T cell exhaustion and immune activation in the 
NSG-BLT model. In addition, we found that expression of TIM-3 
gradually increased on T cells throughout HIV infection (Supple-
mental Figure 2C). Similar to previous reports in HIV-infected 
patients (1, 2) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) 
-infected mice, in HIV-infected NSG-BLT mice we found subsets 
of CD8+ T cells that overexpressed both PD-1 and TIM-3 exhaus-
tion markers (3, 4), and they displayed significantly reduced ability 
to produce proinflammatory cytokines upon mitogen stimulation, 
suggesting impaired functions of these T cells (Figure 1, E and F).
IFN-I signaling is chronically elevated during HIV-1 infection. 
Chronic IFN-I signaling is strongly associated with immune acti-
vation and suppression in persistent virus infections (5–8). To 
examine the extent of IFN-I signaling in vivo, we longitudinally 
measured HIV RNA expression and the expression of the IFN-I–
induced signature genes (ISGs) MX1 and OAS1 in both infected 
and uninfected mice. Humanized BLT mice support sustained 
HIV replication 7 weeks after infection (Figure 2A and refs. 9, 10) 
with gradual loss of CD4 cells and decreased CD4/CD8 ratios 
in the peripheral blood (Figure 2, B and C). MX1 expression lev-
els in the peripheral blood increased rapidly, and both MX1 and 
OAS1 remained elevated in the blood and tissue throughout HIV 
infection (Figure 2, D and E) in comparison with uninfected mice. 
Thus, IFN-I–induced gene expression is maintained in multiple 
compartments following HIV infection in NSG-BLT mice.
IFN-I receptor blockade effectively lowers ISG expression and 
reverse immune exhaustion. To investigate the impact of chron-
ic IFN-I signaling on inflammation and T cell exhaustion, HIV- 
infected BLT mice were treated beginning 13 weeks after infection 
with an anti-human IFN receptor 2 (IFNR2) blocking antibody or 
an isotype control antibody for 1 week. IFNR blockade lowered 
gene expression of the ISGs MX1, OAS1, and IRF7 (Figure 3A and 
Supplemental Figure 5A) in the peripheral blood, demonstrating 
that anti-IFNR treatment blocked human IFN-I signaling in vivo. 
IFNR blockade did not affect overall CD4+ T cell percentages 
among T cells, or CD4/CD8 T cell ratios or CD4 and CD8 T cell 
numbers in the peripheral blood (Supplemental Figure 3, A–D). 
IFNR blockade, but not the isotype antibody, significantly reduced 
levels of PD-1, TIM-3, and CD38 expression on CD8 T cells (Figure 
3B, Supplemental Figure 4, and Supplemental Figure 5, B–E). Fur-
ther, CD8+ T cells from IFNR-blocked mice produced higher levels 
of IFN-γ and IL-2 following mitogen PMA/ionomycin stimulation 
(Figure 3, C and D). To investigate whether HIV-specific CD8 T 
cell responses were improved, splenocytes from HIV-1–infected, 
 
isotype antibody–treated, or anti-IFNR2 antibody–treated 
 
mice were stimulated with an HIV clade B peptide pool (Gag, 
Env, Nef, and Pol) (11–14). IFNR blockade treatment elevated the 
percentage and number of HIV-specific IFN-γ–producing CD8+ T 
cells (Figure 3, E–G) as well as increasing the expression of IFN-γ 
produced by single HIV-specific cells (Figure 3H), indicating 
functional restoration of the HIV-specific T cell response when 
IFN-I signaling is alleviated. Interestingly, we also observed a 
reduction of HLA-DR on CD4+ T cells following IFNR blockade 
(Figure 3I), indicating a reduction in CD4+ T cell activation.
IFNR blockade effectively reduces viral load. With the decreased 
expression of exhaustion factors and increased levels of IFN-γ–

Figure 1. Chronic HIV infection results in elevated expression of activation and exhaustion markers and exhaustion of viral-specific CD8 cells. NSG-BLT 
humanized mice were constructed by implantation of fetal liver and fetal thymus as well as hematopoietic stem cells into the NSG mice. After human 
immune reconstitution, mice were mock-infected or infected with HIVNL4-3. Thirteen weeks after infection, whole blood from each mouse was collected, and 
cells were stained with anti-human antibodies CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, TIM-3, PD-1, and HLA-DR and analyzed by flow cytometry. (A–D) Expression of HLA-DR,

Discussion
One of the hallmarks of HIV infection is chronic immune activa-
tion that promotes viral replication and CD4 depletion. In addition, 
chronic immune activation leads to the upregulation of inhibitory 
molecules and is widely believed to be one of the driving forces of 
immune exhaustion, in which effector cells lose their function and 
proliferation capacities (4, 24–30). Here we show, for the first time 
to our knowledge, that activation and exhaustion markers such as 
HLA-DR, CD38, PD-1, and TIM-3 are elevated in humanized BLT 
mice chronically infected with HIV-1 (Figure 1A) and that CD8 T 
cells expressing multiple suppressive receptors such as PD-1 and 
TIM-3 define an exhausted effector T cell population (Figure 1B) 
as observed in human HIV patients (1, 14) and mice chronically 
infected with LCMV (3). In addition, as in HIV-infected patients, 
we observed upregulated ISGs MX1 and OAS1 in chronically 
infected BLT mice compared with uninfected mice (Figure 2). 
These results indicate that NSG-BLT mice infected with HIV can 
mirror immune activation and immune exhaustion observed in 
HIV-infected patients, making them an important animal model 
to study HIV immunopathogenesis and immunotherapy.
Given the complex activities of IFN-I during acute and chronic 
viral infection (18, 23), it is crucial to delineate the effect of IFN-I 
signaling during different phases of HIV infection, as improper 
modulation of anti-IFN or IFN-α treatment during acute infection 
Figure 6A). As shown in Figure 4G, without CD3/CD28 stimula-
tion, very little viral production was detected, indicating that sort-
ing effectively eliminated productively infected cells. Cells from 
mice treated with IFNR blockade demonstrated reduced levels of 
inducible virus following stimulation, similar to those observed 
in ART-treated mice; both were less than those seen in non-ART/
isotype treatment (Figure 4G). Similarly, we observed significant 
reduction of HIV RNA production from stimulated HSA– cells 
from mice that received IFN-I blockade as compared with isotype 
control (Supplemental Figure 6B). ART treatment further lowered 
the HIV RNA, and combined treatment of ART and IFNR block-
ade had the lowest HIV RNA production, again indicating a smaller 
HIV reservoir. We also observed a trend of decreased HIV DNA in 
unstimulated HSA– cells from IFNR blockade–treated mice versus 
isotype-treated mice (Supplemental Figure 6C). However, it did not 
reach statistical significance. It may be due to the fact that defec-
tive provirus rapidly accumulates during active HIV-1 infection and 
measurement of HIV DNA may not reflect replication-competent 
HIV (22, 23). Nonetheless, we observed significantly reduced HIV 
DNA levels in ART- and IFNR blockade–treated mice as compared 
with mice treated only with ART (Supplemental Figure 6C). All 
together, these results indicate accelerated reduction of the amount 
of reactivatable virus to background levels when IFNR is therapeu-
tically inhibited in conjunction with ART.

could have drastic effects, leading to both faster viral replication 
and disease progression (5, 7, 17, 18). Our results demonstrate that 
IFN-I signaling during chronic HIV infection is one of the driving 
forces underlying chronic inflammation, immune activation, and 
CD8+ T cell exhaustion and that blockade of IFN-I signaling could 
potentially improve T cell immune responses. Contrary to what 
was observed at the onset of acute SIV infection (18), where IFNR 
antagonist resulted in loss of viral control and faster disease pro-
gression, we found that IFNR blockade during the chronic stage 
of the HIV infection led to a reduction of immune activation, 
enhanced HIV-specific CD8+ T cell function, and decreased HIV 
plasma viral load. In addition, we observed a reduction in CD4 T 
cell activation upon IFNR blockade, indicating that a chronically 
elevated level of IFN-I may have directly or indirectly contributed 
to the systematic activation of CD4 T cells. The reduced CD4+ T 
cell activation may have slowed the dissemination of the virus and 
in combination with enhanced immune competence contributed 
to the decrease of viral load. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 
concurrent ART and IFNR blockade during chronic HIV infection 
accelerated viral suppression and ultimate reduction in the reac-
tivatable HIV reservoir. The reduction of this reservoir may have 
resulted from better viral control or a release of viral expression 
that is suppressed by IFN-I responses. IFN-I signaling has been 
shown to suppress viral transcription in HIV-infected cells (31), 
and blockade of IFN-I signaling in the presence of ART treatment 
may reduce the establishment of persistently infected reservoirs. 
Our study highlights the multifaceted activities of IFN-I during 
viral infection and suggests that it may act as a double-edged 
sword during chronic HIV infection, fueling immune activation 
and viral dissemination. Further studies are needed to delineate 
the role of IFN-I signaling during persistent HIV infection and val-
idate IFNR blockade’s therapeutic potential for treating HIV infec-
tion, particularly in conjunction with ART.
Methods
Humanized BLT mice. Humanized mice were constructed as described 
previously (15, 30). In short, CD34+ cells were purified via magnetic cell 
sorting with CD34 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) from freshly obtained 
fetal liver tissues. NOD–SCID–common γ chain knockout (cγ
–/–) mice 
(NSG mice) mice were sublethally irradiated (2.7 Gy) before the sur-
gery and implanted with fetal liver and thymus derived from the same 
donor as the CD34+ cells. Afterward, mice were injected with 0.5 mil-
lion to 1 million CD34+ cells. After 8–10 weeks, each mouse was bled 
retro-orbitally to check human immune cell engraftment. Each donor 
tissue can be used to construct 15–25 mice. Mice that had more than 
50% human lymphocytes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
were used for HIV infection and further experiments. A standard 
healthy uninfected humanized BLT mouse contains 0.5 million to 2 
million human lymphocytes per milliliter in the blood and 10 million to 
30 million human lymphocytes per milliliter in the spleen.)
Antibodies and flow cytometry. The following antibodies were 
used in flow cytometry: CD45 (clone HI30), CD3 (clone OKT3), 
CD4 (clone RPA-T4), CD8 (clone SK1), CD38 (clone HIT2), HLA-
DR (clone L240), PD-1 (clone ebioJ105) (eBioscience), TIM-3 
(clone F38-2E2) (Biolegend), and anti–HIV-1 core antigen clone 
KC57 (Beckman Coulter). Antibody for cell surface markers were 
conjugated to FITC, PE, PerCP-Cy5.5, PE-Cy5, PE-Cy7, EVD, APC, 
APC–eFluor 780, Alexa Fluor 700, eFluor 405, Pacific Orange, or 
Pacific Blue in appropriate combination. The cells were acquired 
using an LSRFortessa flow cytometer and FACSDiva software (BD 
Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software. At least 
1,000 cells were acquired for each analysis, and each representa-
tive flow plot was repeated more than 3 times.
In vitro cytokine assay. We assessed purified splenocytes from 
BLT mice for production of IFN-γ or IL-2 by intracellular staining 
and flow cytometry. Cells were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin 
for 6 hours in the presence of GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences) or treat-
ed with HIV-1 clade B Env, Gag, Pol peptide pool (from NIH AIDS 
Reagent Program, www.aidsreagent.org) overnight and an addi-
tional 6 hours of GolgiPlug treatment. Cells were then stained with 
CD45, CD3, CD8, IFN-γ, and IL-2 (eBioscience).
ART treatment and IFNR blockade treatment. For ART, HIV-infected 
 
mice were treated by daily injection of 500 μl of TDF (8.75 mg/kg)/
FTC (13 mg/kg)/raltegravir (17.5 mg/kg) dissolved in PBS. For IFNR 
blockade treatment, HIV-infected mice, either untreated or treated with 
ART, were treated with 100 μg anti-IFNR2 blocking antibody (clone 
MMHAR-2) or an IgG isotype control (eBioscience) once every 2 days by 
i.p. injection for 1 week. One hundred micrograms every 2 days was cho-
sen because it was the minimum dosage to maintain lower ISG expres-
sion in the humanized BLT mice (data not shown). A treatment course 
of 1 week was chosen because it has been shown to effectively target 
IFN-I signaling in LCMV-infected mice (5). For mice that were treated 
with both ART and IFNR blockade, the anti-IFNR2 antibody was given 
concurrently with the ART regiment at the last week of ART treatment.
Real-time PCR. To measure the levels of cell-associated HIV RNA 
and the ISGs MX1 and OAS1, with HPRT1 as an internal control,  sple-
nocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were harvested for 
RNA extraction and making of cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA 
Figure 3. IFNR blockade effectively lowers ISG expression levels and reverses immune exhaustion. (A) Twelve weeks after infection, mice were treated with 
IFNR blocking antibody (αIFNR) or an isotype antibody control (iso) for 8 days. Expression levels of the ISGs MX1, OAS1, and IRF7 in human PBMCs from human-
ized BLT mice after treatment were measured by real-time RT-PCR (n = 3–5 per group). (B) PD-1, TIM-3, and CD38 expression as measured by flow cytometry

the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for multiple comparisons (A and B, both P < 0.05). Data represent mean ± SEM. Representative experiments were performed 
more than 3 times (C and E).

mice in different treatment groups as measured by real-time RT-PCR (n = 5–11 per group). (C) Relative TIM-3 expression level of CD8+ T cells in PBMCs from 
infected mice in different treatment groups as compared with uninfected mice (n = 5–11 per group). (D) Relative IFN-γ MFI of PMA/ionomycin–stimulated 
CD8+ T cells from infected mice in different treatment groups as compared with uninfected mice (n = 5–11 per group). (E) Changes of viral loads in HIV-1–
infected NSG-BLT mice that were treated with ART or ART plus IFNR blockade (n = 7–10 per group). (F) Fold viral suppression after ART treatment, ART with 
IFNR blockade, or IFNR blockade alone (n = 7–10 per group). (G) HIV p24 production in the supernatant (as measured by ELISA collected from stimulated, 
sorted HSA– cells following the indicated treatments; n = 4–9 per group). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare 2 groups (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.005), 
and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for multiple comparisons (B–D, F, and G; all have P < 0.05). Data represent mean ± SEM.

and distributed for this study without personal identifying informa-
tion. Human fetal tissue was purchased from Advanced Biosciences 
Resources or from StemExpress and was obtained without identify-
ing information and did not require IRB approval for its use. Animal 
research described in this article was performed under the written 
approval of the UCLA Animal Research Committee in accordance 
with all federal, state, and local guidelines. All surgeries were per-
formed under ketamine/xylazine and isoflurane anesthesia, and all 
efforts were made to minimize animal pain and discomfort.

mice were infected with HIVNL4-3HSA, which will allow actively infected 
cells to express mouse heat stable antigen (HSA). After the mice were 
sacrificed, splenocytes were isolated, and HSA+ cells were depleted 
using biotin-conjugated anti-HSA antibody (eBioscience) and Strepta-
vidin Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). HSA– cells were then activated 
with anti-CD3 (plate bound) and anti-CD28 (soluble) and indinavir for 
3 days. Supernatant from activated cells was collected and purified for 
HIV p24 antigen ELISA assay, and cells were collected for HIV DNA 
and RNA real-time PCR analysis.
Statistics. A total of 5 independent cohorts of mice (n = 15–30 total 
mice, each constructed from the same donor tissues) were used in this 
study for various experiments. Two cohorts were pooled for comparing 
uninfected and infected mice. Three cohorts were pooled for comparing 
uninfected mice versus infected mice treated with isotype antibody or 
IFNR blockade versus infected mice treated with ART and isotype anti-
body or IFNR blockade. To pool mice from different cohorts, each mea-
surement (ISG expression level or MFI of activation/exhaustion mark-
ers) was first normalized to the uninfected controls of the cohort. Each 
analysis, including those shown in bar graphs such as the MFI compari-
son or real-time PCR, contains at least 4–7 biological replicates (number 
of mice). For flow analysis of CD4 and CD8 cells, at least 1,000 events 
were acquired for the population of interest. For analysis of data that 
contains more than 2 groups (depicted in Figure 1C; Figure 3, A and B; 
and Figure 4, B–D, F, and G), the Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to 
compare samples; and all of these data have P value less than 0.05. To 
compare statistical difference between 2 groups, Mann-Whitney U tests 
were used. P values less than 0.05 by Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney 
were considered significant. Consultation on statistical analysis was 
performed with the UCLA Center for AIDS Research Biostatistics Core 
and the UCLA Biostatistics Department.
Study approval. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained 
at UCLA in accordance with UCLA IRB–approved protocols under 
written informed consent using an IRB-approved written consent
