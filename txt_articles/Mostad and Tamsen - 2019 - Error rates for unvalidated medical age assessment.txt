Abstract
During 2014–2015, Sweden received asylum applications from more than 240,000 people, of which more than 40,000
were termed unaccompanied minors. In a large number of cases, claims by asylum seekers of being below 18 years
were not trusted by Swedish authorities. To handle the situation, the Swedish national board of forensic medicine (R¨
atts-
medicinalverket, RMV) was assigned by the government to create a centralized system for medical age assessments. RMV
introduced a procedure including two biological age indicators; x-ray of the third molars and magnetic resonance imaging of
the distal femoral epiphysis. In 2017, a total of 9617 males and 337 females were subjected to this procedure. No validation
study for the procedure was however published, and the observed number of cases with different maturity combinations
in teeth and femur were unexpected given the claims originally made by RMV. We present a general stochastic model
enabling us to study which combinations of age indicator model parameters and age population profiles are consistent with
the observed 2017 data for males. We find that, contrary to some RMV claims, maturity of the femur, as observed by RMV,
appears on average well before maturity of teeth. According to our estimates, approximately 15% of the tested males were
children. These children had an approximate 33% risk of being classified as adults. The corresponding risk for an adult to
be misclassified as a child was approximately 7%. We determine uncertainties and ranges of estimates under reasonable
perturbations of the prior.

Introduction
In medical age assessments, certain biological processes
that develop during childhood in a predictable sequence are
used to assess a person’s chronological age. Examples of
such processes are the development of teeth, bones, and
sexual maturity. We will use in this paper the term ‘age indi-
cator” to mean any observed biological feature that develops
through a series of clearly defined states over an age period
relevant for age assessment.
Medical age assessments have been used for a long
time in many countries, but are always associated with
debate. This debate can be divided into two main lines.
One concerns the very use of medical age assessment.
Critics argue that since biological processes always show
such a wide variation in populations, biological states can
never be used to make sufficiently certain assessments
of chronological age. Others might argue that it is the
biological and not the chronological age that is the most
relevant for the needs of an individual.
In most countries, the age is important for the rule of
law. Many countries view the age of 18 as being the bor-
der between childhood and adulthood. Children have other
needs and rights than do adults, and punishments for crimes
might differ whether the perpetrator is below or above 18.
In the case of asylum seekers, children are to be treated dif-
ferently according to international conventions. One might
therefore argue that if a person’s age is unknown, a medi-
cal age assessment may be necessary in order to protect the
privileges of children.
The other line of debate concerns which methods are
appropriate to use. A compilation of methods used in
the European Union shows that most countries use two
or more age indicators [3]. There are variations between
countries, but the two most commonly used methods are

dental x-ray and x-ray imaging of the hand/wrist. Another
commonly used indicator is x-ray imaging of the collar
bone. These three age indicators are all included in the
recommendations by The Study Group on Forensic Age
Diagnostics (Arbeitsgemeinschaft f¨
ur Forensische Alters-
diagnostik; AGFAD), an international assembly of experts
that has worked on this issue for the last 18 years [16, 17].
During the last few years, many asylum seekers in
Sweden have claimed to be under 18 but have not been
able to convince authorities about their claim. To be able to
treat children as children, and to not give child privileges to
adults, the government of Sweden has decided to offer the
possibility to make a medical age assessment in these cases.
When a wave of asylum seekers arrived in 2014–2015,
there was no generally accepted system for medical ages
assessments in Sweden, and R¨
attsmedicinalverket (RMV)
was assigned by the government to create one.
The method1 chosen by RMV uses two age indicators:
magnetic resonance imaging of the distal femur (MRI knee)
and x-ray imaging of the third molars in the mandible (x-ray
teeth) [14]. The MRI knee and x-ray teeth are independently
evaluated by two radiologists and two dentists, respectively.
For the knee to be assessed as mature, both radiologists
must agree on this assessment. If they disagree, the knee is
assessed as immature. The same procedure is used for teeth.
These assessments are then combined in such a way that if
either the knee or the teeth are mature, a male individual
is assessed as being 18 years or older2. During 2017, a
total of 9617 males and 337 females were subjected to this
age assessment procedure. The results for males are given
in Table 1. In 2018, RMV changed their assessments for
females, since a new study showed that the majority of
females aged 16 and 17 years had mature knees (see Ottow
et al. [12], Tamsen [19]). Females now need mature knees
and teeth to be assessed as being 18 years or older. In this
paper, we will only study the RMV data for males.
The maturity of the teeth is assessed according to the
stages of Demirjian, in which a tooth can be in one of eight
stages A–H (see Demirjian et al. [2]). H is the final stage
and the teeth are termed “mature” if at least one of the
mandibular third molars are assessed as being in this stage.
The knee is assessed as “mature” if it has reached stage 4
or 5 according to the classification by Schmeling [8]. The
different stages of immature teeth and knees are not used in
the age assessments made by RMV. For example, if the knee
is mature, it doesn’t matter if the most developed examined

2The exact wording of the conclusions produced by RMV have several
forms. However, as these conclusions are then mapped by the Swedish
migratory authority to decisions about age, the exact wording is of
little consequence. We will in this paper simply refer to assessment of
above or below 18 years.

tooth is in stage G (one stage from mature) or stage F (two

To date, there exist six original articles and one letter
to the editor on age assessment with MRI knee: Dedouit
et al. [1], Kr¨
amer et al. [8], Saint-Martin et al. [15],
Ekizoglu et al. [4], Fan et al. [5], Ottow et al. [12],
Vieth et al. [23]. In addition, there is a non-peer-reviewed
report published by The National Board of Health and
Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) in Sweden [18]. Since there are
differences in MRI techniques and grading systems for
maturity assessment, studies differ as to how relevant they
are in relation to the RMV procedure. Three of the original
studies use MRI techniques and grading systems that are
more or less comparable to the method used by RMV [5, 8,
12]. However, the relatively small number of participants in
relevant ages and shifting results make it hard to regard this
method as validated. More and larger studies are needed.
Another aspect of validity is the application of the
methods. Validation of assessments is an obvious practice
in the field of medicine. Normally, an apprentice makes
assessments under the supervision of an experienced
assessor. When the rate of correct assessments is sufficiently
high, the apprentice is allowed to make them on his or her
own. At least for the maturity assessments of MRI knee,
RMV has not presented any external validation prior to
the large amount of assessments they now have performed.
We also believe a validation should include a study where
one applies to volunteers with known ages the exact
same assessment procedure as the one applied to subjects,
including both knee and teeth assessments and using the
same assessors.
In 137 cases where RMV assessed the knee as
mature, an external second opinion has been performed by
German scientists3. These scientists are the ones who have
developed and continued to study an MRI knee method
close to the one RMV uses. In 75 of these 137 cases (55%),
the German scientists came to the opposite conclusion that
the knee was not mature. The cases that have undergone
second opinions are the result of private initiatives and

they are thus not randomly selected. Therefore, one cannot
generalize these results to all people who have had their
knees assessed as mature. However, one cannot exclude
general discrepancies and since RMV uses these German
studies as the most important foundation for their method,
the results are alarming and require a thorough analysis of
the validity of the Swedish assessments. When faced with
this criticism, RMV performed an analysis of reliability, but
no analysis of validity has yet been reported.
We are thus facing a situation where there is substantial
uncertainty about the true relationship between chronolog-
ical age and the age indicators used by RMV. There is of
course, also a large uncertainty about the true age distri-
bution of the population on which the procedure has been
performed. The only firm evidence is the information pre-
sented in Table 1. Note that according to the table, about
five times as many males are classified with a mature knee
and immature teeth compared to vice versa. This seems at
odds with earlier statements from RMV that knees generally
mature later than teeth. In this paper, we show how simu-
lation within a Bayesian framework may be used to obtain
information about the possible combinations of population
age profiles and age indicator models that may explain this
data. We also show how one may obtain some information
about likely classification error rates in such a situation.
A simple statistical approach to medical age assessment
is the following: an age indicator that can take on discrete
values I1, . . . , In is measured on a study population
with known chronological ages. The study population
is subdivided according to the age indicator, and the
chronological ages within each subgroup are modeled
with some statistical model, possibly just a normal
distribution. Then, this statistical model is used to assess the
chronological age of persons whose observed age indicator
corresponds to the group.
The main drawback of this simple and common approach
is that it assumes that, a priori, the distribution of the ages
of the assessed persons corresponds to the distribution of
ages in the study population. This is clearly not the case
in most applications of age assessments, as the assessment
is generally triggered by circumstances related to age.
For example, an immigration authority may decide to
require medical age assessment of all asylum seekers, of
asylum seekers they believe might be re-classified by the
assessment, or of asylum seekers whose age they are fully
convinced are above the relevant age limit of 18 years.
Clearly different decisions will lead to different rates of
erroneous classification, something that cannot be captured
by the simple statistical procedure above.
In this paper, we instead use the following procedure:
For each age indicator, we use studies where the indicator
has been observed in study populations with known
chronological ages to establish a statistical model predicting
the value of the age indicator as a function of chronological
age. When assessing the age of a person with an observed
age indicator, we combine an a priori distribution for
the persons age with the likelihood provided from the
age indicator and the statistical model to obtain the a
posteriori distribution for the age of the person. This
Bayesian approach is discussed for example in Taroni et al.
[20] (relating to forensics in general) and for example in
Thevissen et al. [21] (relating to age assessments).
For each of the two age indicators appearing in this paper,
we thus need to establish a statistical model predicting
the value of the age indicator from chronological age.
General models are discussed in “Stochastic model”. How
to obtain model parameters from published studies is
discussed in “Age indicator model parameter values”. In
this paper, we assume that, given chronological age, the
probability for observing various values of one indicator
is independent of the value observed for another indicator.
Such an assumption is an approximation of reality, and
one needs to ask how large the approximation is, if it
can be avoided, and in what way it may influence results.
Conditional correlation of age indicators has not been much
studied, but Gelbrich et al. [6] found no significant such
correlation between wrist and third molar maturation. No
study has investigated the conditional correlation between
knee and third molar maturation, indicating again the need
for a proper validation of the RMV procedure. As no data
to build models exists, we are forced in this paper to assume
conditional independence between knee and third molar
maturation. Possible consequences of this assumption are
discussed in “Discussion”.
In order to investigate which combinations of age
indicator models and population age profiles can explain the
data of Table 1, we need to establish an a priori distribution
for the age of the person that is assessed. In case work, such
a distribution will be based on the circumstances of that
person and may vary from case to case. In this paper, we
consider data derived from age assessment of 9280 males,
and we use a common a priori distribution for these, based
simply on the fact that they have in a sense been required4 to
submit themselves to the medical age assessment procedure
arranged by RMV in Sweden.
Preliminary computations presented in our supplemen-
tary material [11] show that using fixed age indicator mod-
els with parameters directly derived from relevant publica-
tions together with a fixed population age profile generally
yields models that cannot explain the data of Table 1. Thus,
we instead build a prior model for the age indicators (“Age

make their under-age plausible are offered the tests. However, if they
then do not agree to take the tests, they will most likely be assessed as

indicator model parameter values”) and for population age
profile (“Specification of prior for the population profile”)
and study predictions from the posterior model given this
data (“Results”). In particular, we study the general prop-
erties of the RMV procedure viewed as a classification
method and draw some conclusions about error rates. We
also study how robust these conclusions are under reason-
able changes in the prior (“Robustness”).
Methods
In “Stochastic model”, we present the stochastic model
enabling us to do the computations specified above. In
“Age indicator model parameter values”, we present the
models we use for teeth and knee age indicators while
“Specification of prior for the population profile” contains
a discussion on how we model the age distribution. Finally,
“Convergence and accuracy” contains some technical
information surrounding simulation with our model.
Stochastic model
We assume K different age indicators are observed. We
assume age indicator k (k = 1, . . . , K) can take on nk
different discrete values, denoted Ik1, Ik2, . . . , Iknk. For
each age indicator k, we assume there is a model with
parameters θk relating the chronological age x of a person
to the probabilities pkj(x | θk) of observing indicator Ikj, so
that we assume
ki
�
j=1
pkj(x | θk) = 1
(1)
for all x.
As an example, assume age indicator k has two different
values, Ik1 representing “immature” and Ik2 representing
“mature”. In some cases, a reasonable parametric model
may be
pk2(x | θk) = �
�x − θk1
θk2
�
(2)
where θk = (θk1, θk2) and � is the inverse Probit function
(i.e., the cumulative distribution function for the standard
normal distribution). Note that θk1 then represents the age at
which 50% of all persons have attained the age indicator I2,
while θk2 represents the variation of the age of attainment
around θk1. We will consider models where age indicator
k can have a third possible value, Ik3, representing “not
assessible”. In fact, a model with a constant probability for
such missing data does not fit the data considered in this
paper. Thus, we use instead a linear dependency of lack of
data on age:
pk3(x | θk) = θk3 + θk4(x − 20)
(3)
pk2(x | θk) = (1 − pk3(x | θk)) �
�x − θk1
θk2
�
(4)
where now θk = (θk1, θk2, θk3, θk4).
For each age indicator k, we use a probability density on
the space of possible parameters θk to model the uncertainty
in the model. Specifically, consider the model of Eqs. 3 and
4. As it is reasonable to think that, given age, lack of data is
independent of maturity of the indicator, we may write
π(θk) = π(θk1, θk2)π(θk3, θk4).
(5)
In our setting, the parameters θk3 and θk4 concerning lack of
data will be well informed by the data we are considering,
so we will use flat priors π(θk3, θk4) ∝ 1 for these. The
priors π(θk1, θk2) will be based on information obtained
from various published studies and will be further discussed
in “Age indicator model parameter values”. We now define
a joint prior
π(θ) = π(θ1)π(θ2) . . . π(θK)
(6)
where θ = (θ1, . . . , θK).
As mentioned above, we assume in this paper that, given
chronological age x, the probability for observing various
values of one indicator is independent of the value observed
for another indicator. Thus, assuming a person has age x,
that a vector v = (z1, . . . , zK) of the K different age
indicators is observed for this person, and given a value for
θ, the probability of observing v can be written as
p(v | x, θ) =
K
�
k=1
pkzk(x | θk).
(7)
Aside from the parameters of the age indicator observa-
tion models used, the major uncertainty in our situation lies
in the distribution of chronological ages in the population
on which the observation procedure is applied. In this paper,
we will use a discretization, using the vector {x1, . . . , xT }
to represent T possible age values. A population profile is
then represented by a vector ψ = (ψ1, . . . , ψT ), with ψi
indicating the probability for age xi, so that �
i ψi = 1. We
will use a Dirichlet prior on ψ, with
(ψ1, . . . , ψT ) ∼ Dirichlet(α/T, . . . , α/T ).
(8)
for some parameter α. Under this prior, the expected value
of each ψi is 1/T . Starting with some distribution with
cumulative density function F which can be considered
reasonable, we choose the xi so that F(xi) = i/T . Thus
the uneven spread of the xi will reflect the population

profile specified by F. The uncertainty around this target
distribution is governed by the parameter α: We get that
ψ1 + · · · + ψi ∼ Beta

�
(9)
so that when α → ∞, we get increasingly little variation
around the target distribution, while α → 0 gives increasing
flexibility.
To make computations, we include in the model a
variable with information about the actual ages of the
persons subjected to the age assessment procedure. Let
v1, v2, . . . , vV be the possible values that an age indicator
vector v can take on, so that V = n1n2 · · · nK. Now let
τ(vi, xj) represent the count of persons of age xj having
observational vector vi, and let
τ =
�
τ(vi, xj)
�
i=1,...,V ;j=1,...,T
(10)
so that τ is the collection of all these counts. Fixing θ and
ψ, τ has a multinomial distribution,

�
N,
�
r(vi, xj | θ, ψ)

(11)
where N is the total number of persons observed and
r(vi, xj | θ, ψ) = ψip(vi | xj, θ)
(12)
is the probability that a person has age xj and observational
vector vi.
The actual observations are contained in the vector y =
(y1, . . . , yV ) where, for i = 1, . . . , V ,
yi =

j=1
τ(vi, xj).
(13)
We have now formulated a full stochastic model for our
variables:
π(y, τ, θ, ψ) = π(y | τ)π(τ | θ, ψ)π(θ)π(ψ).
(14)
Our strategy is to simulate from this joint distribution
conditional on the observed data y using the Metropolis-
Hastings algorithm. There are three different updating steps,
where each of the variables τ, θ, and ψ are updated while
the other variables are kept fixed.
For τ, we get
π(τ | y, θ, ψ) ∝ π(y | τ)π(τ | θ, ψ)
(15)
and as π(y | τ) simply restricts the sums of counts in τ, we
get for i = 1, . . . , V that
(τ(vi, x1), . . . , τ(vi, xT )) ∼ Multinomial

In other words, the posterior probability for a parameter
vector θk is proportional to its prior probability times the
product of the probabilities of observing each of the ni
indicator values at each of the possible ages to the power of
the count of the persons having this age and indicator value.

Age indicator model parameter values
We now turn to obtaining estimates

θk1 and

θk2 for
the parameters of Eq. 2 from published studies on age

indicators. Recall that θ11 represents the age at which 50%
have attained mature molars among those males whose
molar stage can be measured, while θ12 represents the
variability in this age of attainment. For example, according
to the model, the proportions with mature molars will
be approximately 16% and 84% at ages θ11 − θ12 and
θ11 +θ12, respectively. The parameters θ21 and θ22 represent
corresponding values for knee maturity.
Given the raw data from an age indicator study, i.e., a list
of pairs of observed chronological ages and age indicators,
one may use maximum likelihood to fit a model like that of
Eq. 2 and thus obtain an estimate for the model parameters.
However, age indicator studies tend not to publish their raw
data and a more indirect approach is necessary. We have
chosen to in each case construct a plausible raw data set
based on the information in the paper, and then estimate
parameters based on this. As ways of obtaining such raw
data is not the main focus of this paper, we have chosen
fairly ad hoc procedures.
The DARLInG reference data sets, e.g., UK-caucasian
[22], may be as close as one can get to obtaining publicly
available raw data about tooth age indicators. We have taken
from this database information about the ages of the 591
males with lower left third molars in stages D through H. For
each maturity stage, we have assigned ages according to a
normal distribution, applying afterwards a piecewise linear
transformation to map the quantiles of this distribution to
the quantiles listed for the maturity stage. Fitting the model
of Eq. 2 to this data using maximum likelihood, we obtain
the estimates listed in Table 2.
In Lucas et al. [9], examinations from a total of 1000
males are reported, subdivided according to age into
20 groups of 50 males each. Each group consists of
persons with ages within a specified half-year interval; we
approximated the ages as uniformly spread within these
intervals. Table 2 in Lucas et al. [9] reports the number of
males within each group that have mature teeth5. We have
randomly selected the corresponding number of males in
each age group and assigned them an observation of mature
teeth, thus creating data that should correspond fairly well
to the RMV procedure. Applying maximum likelihood
estimation, we obtain the estimates shown in Table 2.
In the classic paper Mincer et al. [10], the male study
population consists of 271 individuals. The number of males
observed with each of the age indicators D, E, F, G, and H
for the mandible is not reported, but we interpolate these
values from Table 1 in the paper, obtaining 37, 43, 45,
55, and 91, respectively. The quantiles of the ages of the
5In fact, the table lists those that are classified as above/below 18 years
according to the method ST-DA [9]. However, as the classification is
(mostly) based only on the left mandibular third molar and the database
UK-caucasian [22], it should correspond directly to classification in
terms of stage H of Demirjian’s scale.
persons in each of these five groups are reported in Table 3
of the paper. Using the same technique as for the DARLInG
data set, we reconstruct plausible raw data based on this
information and obtain estimates listed in Table 2.
Finally, a recent study [7] pools information from a large
number of studies where the third molar has been used as an
age indicator. Table 2 in that paper contains age information
from a total of 11,832 persons6. In a similar way as for the
the data in Lucas et al. [9] we have assigned exact ages
to these 11,832 persons uniformly within the age intervals
and randomly selected the indicated proportion of these as
having mature teeth. We then used maximum likelihood to
obtain estimates θ11 = 20.9 and θ12 = 2.5.
Note that there are substantial differences between
estimates based on different studies. Substantial differences
have also been previously noted (see, e.g., Rolseth et al.
[13] page 111). As an example, Table 2 of Haglund and
M¨
ornstad [7] indicates that 9.4% of 381 25-year olds with
a determinable third molar stage have a stage below H.
This contrasts with Lucas et al. [9] where 100% of 1200
persons between 20 and 25 have stage H. A possible
cause is that studies vary in their details, differing from
the RMV procedure to various degrees. There may also
be systematic biases between studies caused by the use of
different medical personnel trained in different ways.
Conclusions for the parameters of the RMV procedure
are thus uncertain, and to model this, we use a prior
with a substantial amount of uncertainty. Specifically, our
prior density for the parameters θ11 and θ12 of the RMV
procedure is
πTMAIN(θ11, θ12) ∝ Normal(θ11; 19.5, 0.8) ·
Normal(θ12; 1.6, 0.4) · I(θ12 > 0).
(23)
In other words, the prior density is proportional to the
product of two normal densities, truncated so that θ12
is positive. The numbers 0.8 and 0.4 appearing in the
formula above indicate the variability of the prior. A way to
understand the prior is that we are approximately 95% sure
θ11 is in the interval [19.5 − 2 · 0.8, 19.5 + 2 · 0.8] and,
independently, approximately 95% sure θ12 is in the interval
[1.6 − 2 · 0.4, 1.6 + 2 · 0.4]. The prior is illustrated in Fig. 1.
We have chosen to center the prior on the estimates from the
DARLInG dataset: This data refers exactly to the lower left
third molars for males used in the RMV procedure, and the
parameter estimates are in between estimates based on other
data. In “Robustness”, we have investigated the robustness
of our main conclusions under reasonable changes to this
prior: Calling the prior above T MAIN, we have also looked
at results using priors THIGH and TLOW which differ from

females.

At the ages θ11 − θ12 and θ11 + θ12, 16% respectively 84% have mature third molars. The first four columns
display estimates of these values based on four different studies, while the fifth column indicates the values
we have chosen in our prior as the most likely for the RMV procedure. The right-hand part of the table
displays similar values for knee maturity
TMAIN in that the the expected value of θ11, 19.5, is replaced
by 20.5 or 18.5, respectively (see “Robustness”). In our
supplementary material [11], we confirm that our main
conclusions hold even when using a prior centered on the
Haglund estimates.
Turning to knees and the parameters θ21 and θ22, one
source of information is Socialstyrelsen [18], which reports
on two methods for assessing age from knee MRI images.
The study has, to our knowledge, not yet been peer
reviewed, but has been published as a report. One of the
methods investigated is designed to correspond to RMV’s
MRI knee method and has been applied to 119 males with
ages in the 8 intervals 14 − 14.5, 15 − 15.5, . . . , 21 − 21.5
(curiously excluding all males with less than 6 months
to their next birthday). Using the data from the table on
page 59 of the report and applying the same computational
procedure as for Lucas et al. [9], we obtain parameters
listed in Table 2. Socialstyrelsen [18] cannot be seen as
a validation of the RMV procedure, as only the knees of
each person is examined and different assessors are used.
However, one might expect the results to be fairly relevant
for the RMV procedure.
The largest study so far on an MRI knee indicator similar
to that used by RMV is Ottow et al. [12]. Five different
stages of the age indicator occur in the study: IIc, IIIa, IIIb,
IIIc, and IV. Table 3 in Ottow et al. [12] lists the number of
males in the study population for which each indicator value
has been observed, and also gives summary statistics for the
ages within each group. We use from these the minimum,
maximum, and the three quartile values. With these values
as starting point, we reconstruct raw data in a similar way
as for the DARLInG data and apply maximum likelihood
estimation.
As mentioned in the introduction, a small subset of
RMV’s cases has undergone second opinion. In these, more
than half of the knees assessed as mature by RMV was
deemed immature in the second assessment. One cannot
draw general conclusions from such a small and selected
subpopulation, but a worst case scenario might be that
around half of all knees that are “almost mature” (i.e., stage
IIIc) are incorrectly classified as mature in RMV’s material.
Based on that possibility, we have also estimated parameters
under the assumption that half of those 32 observations
classified in Ottow et al. [12] as stage IIIc are counted
together with stage IV (“mature”).
Comparing the results in Table 2, we see that results
based on Socialstyrelsen [18] and Ottow et al. [12] are
quite similar, while the ajdusted results predictably show
somewhat earlier maturation age. However, these studies are
limited in size, and given the large variation observed in
parameters for third molar maturation, it seems dangerous to
draw to firm conclusions about knee maturation parameters
based on only two studies. Thus, we will use the prior
πKMAIN = (θ21, θ22) ∝ Normal(θ21; 18.5, 0.8) ·
Normal(θ22; 1.4, 0.4) · I(θ12 > 0).
(24)
This prior uses the same amount of uncertainty as the prior
in Eq. 23, but centered on the values 18.5 and 1.4. The
prior is illustrated in Fig. 1. Calling it KMAIN, we have also
looked at results using priors KHIGH and KLOW which differ
from KMAIN in that the the expected value of θ21, 18.5, is
replaced by 19.5 or 17.5, respectively.
Specification of prior for the population profile
Specification of a prior age distribution for the population of
males that have been subjected to RMVs age determination
procedure during 2017 is a difficult task. The prior for
an individual should be based on all knowledge about
this individual excluding the age indicators. Such general

knowledge can include other observations of biological
maturity made by medical personnel, observations of
psychological maturity made by teachers or other qualified
observers, documentable circumstances surrounding the life
situation, as well as of course the reasons why the person
has been required by the Swedish migration authority to
complete the RMV procedure. The age prior for the whole
population studied in this paper should represent an average
over their individual priors.
The difficulties with establishing such a prior can
lead some researchers to the conclusion that frequentist
statistical methods where a prior does not seem to be needed
are preferable to our Bayesian approach. However, when
conclusions are drawn using such frequentist methods, they
generally correspond to the use of a particular prior, as
mentioned in the introduction. For example, the “hidden”
prior assumption may be that the a priori age distribution
corresponds to that of a study population, or that it is
uniform within some age interval, for example between 14
and 25. So, the relevant question is whether we can establish
a prior that is more realistic than such hidden priors.
In this paper, we will use as a starting point an age profile
illustrated in Fig. 2. This line represents the cumulative prior
probability that a person has an age below that given on the
x-axis. Thus, for example, the prior probability that a person
is below 18 years is about 35%. Mathematically, the prior
is represented by a gamma density with parameters 4 and
1, translated to be at least 15 and truncated to the interval
between 15 and 30. As this distribution is rather arbitrarily
chosen, we use a hierarchical prior with a lot of uncertainty
around this starting point. First, we discretize the age
variable into T = 100 possible ages (see Stochastic model”
for details). Then, we model the proportions of the population

population below that age. The dashed lines represent 50% credibility
intervals at each age for the proportion in the population having this
age or less. The dotted lines represent a 95% credibility interval
at each age with a Dirichlet distribution depending on a
hyperparameter α (see Eq. 8). Essentially, if α is close
to zero, any combination of proportions is almost equally
likely, and the prior imposes no structure on the possible
age profile. If α is large (say, 1000) only age profiles
that have almost equal proportions at each discrete age
are possible. This forces any age profile to look almost
as the starting point profile mentioned above. We use
the compromise value α
=
3. As can be seen in
Fig. 2, 95% credibility intervals for the prior percentage
of persons that have reached specific ages are then quite
wide. Thus, we believe the prior is flexible enough so
that our choice of starting point will not influence results
significantly; this is further discussed in the supplementary
material [11].
Convergence and accuracy
The MCMC simulation outlined in “Stochastic model” is a
Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm, using Gibbs sampling
for ψ and τ and proposal functions for θ1 and θ2,
the tooth and knee model parameters, respectively. We
use symmetric proposal functions, perturbing the four
parameters θ11, θ12, θ21, and θ22 using normal distributions
(see the R code for details). Our acceptance rates were
around 0.3, while the autocorrelations unfortunately became
quite high.
However, as the algorithm outlined above was straight-
forward to implement, we have chosen to stick with it rather
than work on more complex MCMC proposal functions.
Indeed, with clearly unimodal posteriors, convergence is
fairly easy to assess using plots and multiple chains with
different starting points. For final results, we simulated 1
million MCMC cycles for each model, using a burn-in
 Int J Legal Med (2019) 133:613–623
621
of 20000 cycles. Each such computation took around 20 min
on a laptop. The R code used is available from the supple-
mentary material [11].
Results
Using the main prior presented in “Age indicator model
parameter values” and “Specification of prior for the
population profile”, we obtained results shown in Table 3.
Regarding the RMV procedure as a classification procedure
for being above 18 years, we also obtain, in percent (with
95% credibility intervals in parentheses): sensitivity, 93
(86–98); specificity, 67 (39–94); positive predictive value,
93 (76–100); negative predictive value, 59 (7–92).
It may be more revealing to look at the consequences
of the RMV procedure when individuals are sorted into
the categories of Table 1. Table 4 shows the percentage
of children in each of the categories. Note in particular,
the percentage of children among those with mature teeth
and immature knees, and vice versa. These are classified as
adults with the RMV procedure.
The posterior expectations for the age indicator model
parameters are not very different from the prior expecta-
tions: The prior and posterior expectations are 19.5 and 19.4
for θ11, 1.6 and 1.6 for θ12, 18.5 and 18.1 for θ21, and 1.4 and
1.5 for θ22, respectively. However, the uncertainty around
these expectations is reduced (see Fig. 3). Note also that
average posterior estimates for θ13 and θ23, the proportion of
persons with no observable maturity for their tooth or knee
at 20 years, respectively, are 0.18 and 0.04. The proportion
seems to increase slightly with age for teeth (with θ14 aver-
aging 0.02) but be fairly stable for knees (with θ24 close to
zero). In the posterior model, θ11 − θ21 averages 1.36, with
1.18, 1.53 as a 50% credibility interval and 0.85, 1.9 as a
95% credibility interval. Thus, it is clear that knees on the
average mature earlier than teeth (see the next section for
a further discussion of this difference). Finally, Fig. 4 illus-
trates the posterior population age distribution. Comparing

substantially shifted towards higher ages. The uncertainty is
also smaller.
Robustness
In any Bayesian analysis, it is important to study how
reasonable changes to the prior may affect conclusions. In
the present context, this is particularly important, as the only
firm data we use are those of Table 1; all other information
is input using the prior. For example, the fit of the data will
not be influenced if we change the age indicator models by

Results for our main priors are in the centers of the tables; other results are for various combinations of the
priors TLOW, TMAIN, and THIGH for teeth and KLOW, KMAIN, and KHIGH for knees. The parentheses contain
95% credibility intervals
simply translating the ages they refer to and at the same
time correspondingly translate the ages of the population
age prior.
In the supplementary material [11], we have studied the
effects of changes in both the age indicator prior and the
population age profile prior. Here, we focus on studying the
effect on some of the main conclusions from the previous
section. Table 5 shows results for the two most interesting
classification error rates from Table 4. An interpretation of
these results is that the rates are probably around 20–25%,
but they may also be either higher or lower.
Finally, Fig. 5 shows the distribution of the difference
θ11 − θ21 under different priors. The figure establishes very
clearly that, even if we vary the priors as specified, the diffe-
rence is roughly between 1 and 1.5 years. Note that this is the
case even when we use the priors TLOW and KHIGH, where
the difference apriori is negative. Thus, it is clearly estab-
lished that the data of Table 1 is incompatible with models
where the knee on average matures later than the teeth.

results are large, we show how it is possible to obtain some
information about model parameters and error rates using
only classification counts and priors guided by published
studies. A key reason that results are possible to obtain is
that two age indicators have been observed, so that one can
learn about the differences in their parameters. Applying our
model in a situation with three or more age indicators would
probably further strengthen results.
Parts of our results are formulated viewing the RMV
procedure as a classification method for classifying people
as above or below 18 years. This should in no way
be interpreted as support for the idea that medical age
assessment should be viewed as a classification procedure.
Instead, we believe that medical age assessment should
produce information about age specifying both the range
of likely ages and the uncertainty in the information.
Such information can then be combined with uncertain
information from other sources. Indeed, within most legal
systems, there is a requirement to weigh all relevant
information together before making a legal decision about
age. We hope to return with a different paper specifying
how we propose computations in connection with medical
age assessments can best be done. Indeed, in spite of the
issues we raise with the RMV procedure, we believe
medical age assessment can be a well-functioning tool when
observation methods are properly selected and validated
and computational methods are selected and performed
correctly. But in this paper, the focus has been to study
the consequences of the procedure, which in practice has
functioned as a classification rule in Sweden.
According to our findings, about 33% of all male
children that have been subjected to the RMV procedure
have been erroneously classified as adults (i.e., the
specificity is about 0.67). Conversely, the sensitivity of
about 0.93 means that about 7% of male adults have been
classified as children. Some other findings are summarized
in Table 4, which shows that error rates are quite substantial
for several of the 9 categories the RMV procedure classifies
into. Although the chance of classifying adults as children
is very high in some cases (for example about 72% for those
with immature teeth and no data for their knee), we would
 Int J Legal Med (2019) 133:613–623
623
argue that it is the risk of classifying children as adults that
is the most serious issue, as such a misclassification has the
most serious consequences for the individual. Our findings
show that about 19% of those classified with a mature knee
and immature teeth are children, as are about 24% of those
classified with an immature knee and mature teeth. Taking
into account the uncertainty that surrounds our choice of
priors, Table 5 supports the claim that we can be confident
these rates are in the interval 10–40%.
An important finding is that the age at which 50% of
all males have a mature knee appear on average about 1–
1.5 years before the corresponding age for teeth, when
measured with the RMV procedure. The robustness of
this claim is illustrated in Fig. 5, which shows that the
conclusion is fairly insensitive to reasonable changes in the
priors.
In addition to the influence from choices of parameters
in our priors, our results are of course also influenced
by our choice of model. We have already mentioned that
we assume conditional independence of the age indicators
given age. We also assume a particular shape of the maturity
function in Eq. 2; further studies may refine such choices.
Finally, we have made no attempt to adjust for the fact that
the asylum seekers the RMV procedure has been applied
to generally have different genetic and socioeconomic
backgrounds compared to the study populations of most age
indicator studies.
Generally, there is a large uncertainty in our numerical
results. This is an unavoidable consequence of the fact that
the only firm data available on the RMV procedure are those
of Table 1. As this procedure has determined the fate of
thousands of young people, and continues to do so, there is
an urgent need for a proper validation to provide more data.
