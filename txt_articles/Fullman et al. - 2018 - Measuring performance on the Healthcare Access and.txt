Measuring performance on the Healthcare Access and 
Quality Index for 195 countries and territories and selected 
subnational locations: a systematic analysis from the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2016
GBD 2016 Healthcare Access and Quality Collaborators*
Summary
Background A key component of achieving universal health coverage is ensuring that all populations have access to 
quality health care. Examining where gains have occurred or progress has faltered across and within countries is 
crucial to guiding decisions and strategies for future improvement. We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) to assess personal health-care access and quality with the Healthcare Access 
and Quality (HAQ) Index for 195 countries and territories, as well as subnational locations in seven countries, from 
1990 to 2016.
Methods Drawing from established methods and updated estimates from GBD 2016, we used 32 causes from which 
death should not occur in the presence of effective care to approximate personal health-care access and quality by 
location and over time. To better isolate potential effects of personal health-care access and quality from underlying 
risk factor patterns, we risk-standardised cause-specific deaths due to non-cancers by location-year, replacing the local 
joint exposure of environmental and behavioural risks with the global level of exposure. Supported by the expansion 
of cancer registry data in GBD 2016, we used mortality-to-incidence ratios for cancers instead of risk-standardised 
death rates to provide a stronger signal of the effects of personal health care and access on cancer survival. We 
transformed each cause to a scale of 0–100, with 0 as the first percentile (worst) observed between 1990 and 2016, and 
100 as the 99th percentile (best); we set these thresholds at the country level, and then applied them to subnational 
locations. We applied a principal components analysis to construct the HAQ Index using all scaled cause values, 
providing an overall score of 0–100 of personal health-care access and quality by location over time. We then compared 
HAQ Index levels and trends by quintiles on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary measure of overall 
development. As derived from the broader GBD study and other data sources, we examined relationships between 
national HAQ Index scores and potential correlates of performance, such as total health spending per capita.
Findings In 2016, HAQ Index performance spanned from a high of 97·1 (95% UI 95·8–98·1) in Iceland, followed by 
96·6 (94·9–97·9) in Norway and 96·1 (94·5–97·3) in the Netherlands, to values as low as 18·6 (13·1–24·4) in 
the Central African Republic, 19·0 (14·3–23·7) in Somalia, and 23·4 (20·2–26·8) in Guinea-Bissau. The pace of 
progress achieved between 1990 and 2016 varied, with markedly faster improvements occurring between 2000 and 
2016 for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, whereas several countries in Latin America and 
elsewhere saw progress stagnate after experiencing considerable advances in the HAQ Index between 1990 and 2000. 
Striking subnational disparities emerged in personal health-care access and quality, with China and India having 
particularly large gaps between locations with the highest and lowest scores in 2016. In China, performance ranged 
from 91·5 (89·1–93·6) in Beijing to 48·0 (43·4–53·2) in Tibet (a 43·5-point difference), while India saw a 30·8-point 
disparity, from 64·8 (59·6–68·8) in Goa to 34·0 (30·3–38·1) in Assam. Japan recorded the smallest range in 
subnational HAQ performance in 2016 (a 4·8-point difference), whereas differences between subnational locations 
with the highest and lowest HAQ Index values were more than two times as high for the USA and three times as high 
for England. State-level gaps in the HAQ Index in Mexico somewhat narrowed from 1990 to 2016 (from a 20·9-point 
to 17·0-point difference), whereas in Brazil, disparities slightly increased across states during this time (a 17·2-point 
to 20·4-point difference). Performance on the HAQ Index showed strong linkages to overall development, with high 
and high-middle SDI countries generally having higher scores and faster gains for non-communicable diseases. 
Nonetheless, countries across the development spectrum saw substantial gains in some key health service areas from 
2000 to 2016, most notably vaccine-preventable diseases. Overall, national performance on the HAQ Index was 
positively associated with higher levels of total health spending per capita, as well as health systems inputs, but these 
relationships were quite heterogeneous, particularly among low-to-middle SDI countries.
Interpretation GBD 2016 provides a more detailed understanding of past success and current challenges in improving 
personal health-care access and quality worldwide. Despite substantial gains since 2000, many low-SDI and middle-
SDI countries face considerable challenges unless heightened policy action and investments focus on advancing

access to and quality of health care across key health services, especially non-communicable diseases. Stagnating or 
minimal improvements experienced by several low-middle to high-middle SDI countries could reflect the complexities 
of re-orienting both primary and secondary health-care services beyond the more limited foci of the Millennium 
Development Goals. Alongside initiatives to strengthen public health programmes, the pursuit of universal health 
coverage hinges upon improving both access and quality worldwide, and thus requires adopting a more comprehensive 
view—and subsequent provision—of quality health care for all populations.

Introduction
Providing access to quality health care is among 
the foremost objectives of health systems,1,2 because the 
receipt of effective personal health care can substantially 
improve many health outcomes and avert premature 
mortality. The advancement of population health was 
elevated to global agendas with the Alma Ata Declaration 
of 1978, wherein WHO called for the achievement of 
“health for all” by 2000.3 Such aspirations garnered new 
momentum in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Improving, and subsequently measuring, health-care access and 
quality has emerged as an increasing priority alongside a 
heightened emphasis on universal health coverage in the 
Sustainable Development Goal era. Nevertheless, few studies 
have sought to assess personal health-care access and quality 
across a wide range of key health service dimensions and the 
development spectrum. Primarily focused on high-income 
countries, past analyses have used amenable mortality—deaths 
from causes that should not occur in the presence of high-quality 
health care—to approximate national levels of personal 
health-care access and quality. Drawing from the Global Burden 
of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), 
the GBD collaboration used this amenable mortality framework 
in developing the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index, 
and subsequently offered several advances from previous work. 
First, the extensive cause-of-death standardisation processes that 
occur as part of GBD enabled better comparisons across locations 
and over time. Second, risk-standardising death rates for 
environmental and behavioural risk factors helped isolate 
differences in health-care access and quality from variations in 
death rates due to background risk exposure. Third, estimating 
the HAQ Index for 195 countries and territories from 
1990 to 2015, allowed for a broader investigation of trends in 
personal health-care access and quality across the development 
spectrum. Despite these methodological strengths, additional 
areas for improvement were identified, including the 
consideration of health outcomes that more directly reflect the 
progression of disease onset to mortality for amenable causes 
and examining subnational inequalities.
Added value of this study
Based on updated cause of death and risk factor estimates from 
the GBD 2016 study, our analysis offers an improved 
assessment of national levels of personal health-care access and 
quality from 1990 to 2016. For the first time, we report 
subnational levels and trends on the HAQ Index for 
seven countries: Brazil, China, England, India, Japan, Mexico, 
and the USA. Because of major improvements in cancer 
estimation and data availability, we used mortality-to-incidence 
ratios rather than risk-standardised death rates from cancer, 
ultimately providing a more robust approximation of cancer 
detection and treatment effects across countries. To improve 
index stability, we used percentiles (ie, first and 99th percentile) 
for transforming HAQ Index components to a scale of 0–100. 
Finally, we did an exploratory analysis of national HAQ Index 
levels and potential correlates of performance, examining 
relationships between the HAQ Index and some indicators such 
as health financing (eg, total health spending per capita).
Implications of all the available evidence
Globally, personal health-care access and quality improved since 
1990, with many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast 
Asia accelerating their pace of progress from 2000 to 2016. Such 
gains in the more recent time period could reflect the catalytic 
effects of the Millennium Development Goals and their focus on 
a subset of health service areas (ie, vaccine-preventable diseases, 
infectious diseases, and maternal and child health). 
Nonetheless, inequalities increased in some parts of the world, 
which might be related to many low-to-middle income 
countries recording much slower gains for cancers and other 
non-communicable diseases. Large disparities in subnational 
levels of personal health-care access and quality emerged for 
several countries, especially China and India. These results 
emphasise the urgent need to improve both access to and 
quality of health care across service areas and for all populations; 
otherwise, health systems could face widening gaps between 
the health services they provide and the disease burden 
experienced by local communities. Going forward, the HAQ 
Index can provide a robust measure for both informing and 
monitoring the effects of policy action on health-care access and 
quality, a key component of achieving universal health coverage. 
To deliver health systems for the next generation and hasten 
progress in the Sustainable Development Goal era, now is the 
time to align investments for improving access and quality 
across the full range of health-care needs.

era,4 with a heightened emphasis on attaining universal 
health coverage in this pursuit. Making progress on 
universal health coverage entails all people having access 
to quality health services they need without incurring 
financial hardship.5 To advance toward this ambition, it is 
crucial to monitor where improvements in health-care 
access and quality have occurred, and where progress 
must be accelerated, across the development spectrum.
Measuring health-care access and quality has become 
an increasingly important priority alongside its ascent in 
global health policy. In particular, the use of amenable 
mortality—deaths from causes that should not occur in 
the presence of effective medical care—to approximate 
national levels of personal health-care access and quality 
has gained greater traction.6–15 Amenable mortality 
metrics are thought to provide a strong signal of what 
can or should be addressed by the receipt of effective 
health care, and thus perform 
ance on overall personal 
health-care access and quality. Combining such measures 
with those capturing avertable or preventable health 
outcomes (ie, burden that can be avoided through public 
health programmes or policies implemented outside the 
immediate health sector) can offer a more complete set 
of potential pathways for improving health.1,16 The Nolte 
and McKee list of causes amenable to health care6–9 
remains the most widely used framework to quantify 
national levels of health-care access and quality on the 
basis of amenable mortality. This is particularly true for 
Europe,11,15,17 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD),12 and the USA,13 but in-
creasingly also for other country-specific analyses (eg, 
Brazil,14 China,18 and Mexico19). As part of the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 
(GBD 2015),20 the GBD collaboration applied this 
framework to develop a novel measure, the Healthcare 
Access and Quality (HAQ) Index, to track gains and gaps 
in personal health-care access and quality in 195 countries 
and territories over time.
The HAQ Index offered several strengths and in-
sights into personal health-care access and quality 
across countries, which has prompted calls for further 
improvements. First, 32 causes considered amenable 
to health care comprise the HAQ Index, representing 
a range of health service areas: vaccine-preventable 
diseases; infectious diseases and maternal and child 
health; non-communicable diseases, including cancers, 
cardiovascular diseases, and other non-communicable 
diseases such as diabetes; and gastro 
intestinal con-
ditions from which surgery can easily avert death 
(eg, appendicitis). Other than in high-income countries, 
past research rarely accounts for this array of services,21 
even though effective preventive interventions, treat 
ment, 
and medical technologies exist; instead, these studies 
often focus on infectious diseases and maternal and child 
health, and do not shed light on potential challenges 
across service areas. Second, because GBD quantifies risk 
exposure and risk-attributable deaths, we could account 
for local variations in risk exposure and better isolate 
differ 
ences in mortality related to health care. Nonetheless, 
challenges can still exist in ensuring that these mea-
sures provide a strong signal on health-care access and 
quality. For instance, in the absence of stronger monitor-
ing systems, low rates of cancer mortality could 
actually represent inadequate detection and treatment of 
cancer rather than good access to cancer screening and 
high-quality care.22 Third, although some insights into 
the relationship between the HAQ Index and socio-
demographic development were explored in GBD 2015,20 
further examination of how health financing and system 
measures are related to the HAQ Index has yet to occur. 
Fourth, considerable debate continues about how well the 
current cause list represents the range of causes amenable 
to health care, particularly non-fatal outcomes, as well as 
the ages at which health care can substantially im-
prove outcomes. Finally, GBD 2015 highlighted sizeable 
in 
equalities across countries20 but did not capture sub-
national differences in personal health-care access and 
quality, a crucial need in light of the magnitude by which 
health outcomes can vary within countries.23–30
In this study, we provide updated estimates from 
1990 to 2016 for the HAQ Index in 195 countries and 
territories, as well as at global and regional levels. For the 
first time, we report subnational estimates of the HAQ 
Index for seven countries, allowing for a more in-depth 
examination of inequalities in personal health-care 
access and quality. With the improved estimation of 
cancers in GBD 2016,31–33 we use mortality-to-incidence 
ratios (MIRs) for cancers to better reflect potential 
differences in cancer diagnostic and treatment capacity 
across locations. Finally, we do an exploratory analysis of 
the associations between the HAQ Index and potential 
correlates of performance.
Methods
Overview
Drawing from methods established in GBD 2015,20 our 
analysis involved four steps: mapping the Nolte and 
McKee cause list to GBD causes; constructing MIRs for 
cancers and risk-standardising non-cancer deaths to 
remove variations in mortality not directly amenable to 
health care; calculating the HAQ Index on the basis of 
principal components analysis (PCA), providing an 
overall score of personal health-care access and quality 
on a scale of 0–100; and examining associations between 
national HAQ Index scores and potential correlates 
of performance.
Our study draws from GBD 2016 results,31–33 which 
entail several improvements since GBD 2015, including 
169 new country-years of vital registration data, 528 new 
cancer-registry years with a total of 92 countries’ cancer 
registries,31 five new risk factors,32 and cause-specific 
mortality modelling updates (eg, cancers, tuberculosis).31 
Further information can be found in the appendix 
(pp 12–89) and the GBD 2016 capstone series.31–33

In addition to national and aggregated HAQ Index 
results, we report estimates at the subnational level 
for Brazil (26 states and the Federal District), China 
(33 provinces and special administrative regions), England 
(nine regions and 150 local government areas), India 
(31 states and union territories), Japan (47 prefectures), 
Mexico (32 states), and the USA (50 states and the 
District of Columbia).
As with all GBD revisions, GBD 2016 HAQ Index 
estimates for the full time series published here 
supersede previous iterations. This analysis complies 
with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health 
Estimates Reporting (GATHER);34 additional information 
is found in the appendix (pp 5–7).
Mapping the Nolte and McKee amenable cause list to 
GBD causes
We mapped 32 of 33 causes from the Nolte and McKee 
cause list6–9 to GBD causes in accordance with International 
Classification of Diseases codes (table 1; appendix p 156). 
GBD includes thyroid diseases within a larger residual 
category, and only non-fatal outcomes are estimated for 
benign prostatic hyperplasia; consequently, these causes 
were not included in our analyses. GBD provides separate 
estimates for diphtheria and tetanus, so we disaggregated 
these causes from the original Nolte and McKee list.
Mortality-to-incidence ratios for cancers
GBD cancer mortality estimates are informed by MIRs, 
which are derived from incidence and mortality data 
recorded in cancer registries; more detail on MIR 
estimation is in the appendix (pp 41–49).31 MIRs provide a 
good approximation of cancer survival and have been 
used to identify countries with higher or lower cancer 
mortality relative to incidence.22,35 Because of the 
improved quantity and quality of cancer registry data 
from GBD 2016, we used cancer-specific MIRs instead of 
risk-standardised death rates. As detailed in the appendix 
(pp 10–11), cancer-specific MIRs were more strongly 
correlated with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), 
a measure of overall development, than were risk-
standardised death rates. These results, and the dis-
tribution of MIRs by SDI quintile (appendix pp 96–111), 
showed that cancer MIRs provide a more robust signal of 
cancer care access and quality than do risk-standardised 
death rates.
Risk-standardisation of death rates for non-cancer causes
To better isolate differences in mortality associated with 
health-care access and quality from differences associated 
with underlying risk exposure, we risk-standardised 
cause-specific deaths to global levels of risk exposure.32 
We did not risk-standardise differences in exposure to 
three metabolic risk factors (high systolic blood pressure, 
high total cholesterol, and high fasting plasma glucose) 
given their amenability to health care (eg, diagnosis and 
treat 
ment of hypertension in primary care). For the

Although 0 (at birth) to 1 are listed as the lower bound of age ranges, age 
restrictions are applied for many causes such that mortality estimates are not 
produced before a given age group (eg, 15–19 years for many non-communicable 
diseases). Causes are ordered on the basis of the GBD cause list and corresponding 
group hierarchies. GBD=Global Burden of Disease.

24 non-cancer causes, we risk-standardised deaths by re-
moving the joint effects of location-specific behavioural 
and environmental risk exposure, and replaced these 
estimates with the global level of joint risk exposure 
(appendix pp 9–10).
Joint population attributable fraction (PAF) estimation 
accounts for effects of multiple risks combined, including 
the mediation of different risk factors through each 
other. More detail on the PAF calculations and risk-
standardisation is provided in the appendix (pp 9–10). 
Since GBD 2015,36 five risk factors were added, 
most notably low birthweight and short gestation,32 
which enabled the risk-standardisation of neonatal dis-
order deaths. Risk-standardised deaths equalled observed 
deaths for causes in which no risk–outcome pairs 
have met evidence thresholds for inclusion in GBD 
(eg, diphtheria, appendicitis).
Age-standardisation
Using the GBD world population data,37 we age-
standardised risk-standardised death rates, as well 
as cancer mortality and incidence estimates, before pro-
ducing MIRs. We rescaled age weights to equal 1, by 
cause, a necessary step since included age groups rep-
resented a subset of the age groups comprising the world 
population standard.
Constructing the HAQ Index
By cause, we log-transformed age-standardised risk-
standardised death rates (or MIRs for cancers) and scaled 
them from 0 to 100 across locations from 1990–2016. 
Zero was determined by the first percentile observed (ie, 
highest death rates or MIRs), and 100 was applied to the 
99th percentile (ie, lowest death rates or MIRs). This 
scaling approach differs somewhat from that of 
GBD 2015,20 wherein maximum values determined zero 
and mini 
mum values set 100. Using a percentile-based 
approach more closely aligns with other index con-
struction methods used in GBD,38 and is less sensitive to 
outliers or fluctuations in estimates over time. We then 
applied cause-specific thresholds set by the national level 
to subnational locations.
We used PCA to construct the HAQ Index on the basis 
of scaled cause values, resulting in an overall score on a 
scale of 0–100. The GBD 2016 HAQ Index differed in 
three main ways from GBD 2015. First, no cause had 
negative PCA weights (ie, implying that higher death 
rates were associated with access to higher-quality health 
care), so all causes contributed to the final index. In GBD 
2015, colon and breast cancers had negative PCA weights 
in the first PCA iteration, so their weights were ultimately 
set to zero. Second, some cancers had PCA weights more 
similar to communicable, maternal, and neonatal causes, 
which meant these causes were weighted more equally 
(appendix p 157). Finally, we derived PCA weights from 
country-level estimates and applied them to subnational 
results; this approach provides greater stability across 
GBD iterations, particularly as the GBD continues to 
expand its subnational assessments.
Examining correlates of HAQ Index performance
The HAQ Index reflects many factors that affect service 
access and quality across the continuums of care and 
therapeutic areas, and thus it is challenging to distinguish 
the unique contribution of access versus quality from 
other potential drivers.39 To provide an initial examination 
of correlates with HAQ Index performance, we ran 
Pearson correlations between location-specific HAQ 
Index values with financial measures (eg, total health 
spending per capita),40 and health system inputs and 
outputs (eg, outpatient and inpatient utilisation).33 We 
selected these indicators on the basis of data availability 
in relation to GBD locations, and thus they do not 
represent all possible correlates.
Comparing performance on the HAQ Index across the 
development spectrum
As well as examining global patterns, we report differ-
ences in the HAQ Index across levels of development. To 
do this, we used SDI, a summary measure of overall 
develop 
ment based on average income per capita, edu-
cational attainment, and total fertility rates.41 Countries are 
grouped by SDI quintiles, as established in GBD 2016, on 
the basis of their 2016 SDI values.31
Uncertainty analysis
GBD aims to propagate uncertainty throughout its 
estimation process, which results in uncertainty intervals 
(UIs) accompanying each estimate. We estimated the 
HAQ Index for each location-year on the basis of 
1000 draws from the posterior distribution for each 
included cause of death. 95% UIs were based on the 
2·5th and 97·5th quantiles of the draws for each measure.

Results
National and subnational patterns in personal health-
care access and quality
The HAQ Index performance followed distinct geo-
graphical patterns in 2016 (figure 1), with most countries 
in the highest decile clustered in Europe or nearby 
(ie, Iceland), and almost all countries in the lowest decile 
located in sub-Saharan Africa. Exceptions to this pattern 
included Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand in 
the tenth decile, and Afghanistan in the first decile. 
More heterogeneity emerged among the next deciles of 
performance (eg, USA, UK, Malta, Lebanon, Singapore, 
and South Korea, in the ninth decile; Cuba, Chile,

2241
Saudi Arabia, and Russia, in the eighth decile). 
Most Latin American countries scored between 
the fourth and sixth deciles, whereas southeast Asia fea-
tured a broader range, spanning from the seventh 
(Thailand and Sri Lanka) to third deciles (Cambodia, 
Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, and Timor-Leste). By 2016, 
many sub-Saharan African coun 
tries improved their 
performance from 1990 and 2000 (appendix pp 113–14), 
such as South Africa and Botswana rising to the 
fourth decile, and several locations moving to the third 
decile (eg, Kenya, Rwanda, Namibia, Nigeria, Ghana). 
African countries that remained in the first decile since 
1990 were generally concentrated in central and eastern 
sub-Saharan Africa.
We applied the deciles set by national HAQ Index scores 
in 2016 to subnational locations (figure 2), and a more 
nuanced landscape surfaced regarding inequalities in 
personal health-care access and quality. China was in the 
eighth decile in 2016, and had provinces spanning from 
the tenth decile (Beijing 91·5, 95% UI 89·1–93·6) to the 
fourth decile (Tibet 48·0, 43·5–53·2), with a higher 
performance (ie, eighth and ninth deciles) among eastern 
provinces and lower (ie, fifth and sixth deciles) in western 
provinces. For India, which was in the third decile in 2016, 
subnational performance ranged from the sixth (Goa 64·8, 
59·6–68·8; Kerala 63·9, 58·6–67·0) to the second deciles 
(Assam 34·0, 30·3–38·1; and Uttar Pradesh 34·9, 
31·1–38·4). Brazil and Mexico, each in the sixth decile 
nationally for 2016, had variable subnational patterns. In 
Brazil, performance was as high as the eighth decile for 
the Federal District (75·4, 72·3–78·1), but most states, 
particularly northern ones, were in the fifth decile. 
Conversely, Mexico featured six states in the seventh decile, 
whereas most others were in the sixth decile; four states, 
all along Mexico’s southern border, fell within the 
fifth decile. Both occupying the ninth decile nationally, 
England and the USA had subnational locations spanning 
from the tenth to seventh deciles in 2016; Blackpool 
(79·7 [76·6–82·8]) had the lowest HAQ Index score in 
England and Mississippi (81·5 [78·6–84·2]) had the lowest 
score in the USA. The USA’s highest HAQ Index scores 
were limited to a subset of northeastern states, Minnesota, 
and Washington state, and higher performance was 
primarily dispersed across southern England. Nearly all 
Japanese prefectures occupied the top decile of HAQ 
Index performance in 2016. The appendix contains a more 
in-depth exploration of subnational trends over time by 
country (pp 115–28).
Patterns of performance on the overall HAQ Index and 
health areas varied considerably across countries in 
Figure 1: Map of HAQ Index values, by decile, in 2016
Deciles are based on the distribution of HAQ Index values in 2016. Where lower and upper bounds of deciles appear to overlap, they should be interpreted as values up to but not equalling the upper 
bound in the preceding decile (ie, exclusive of the upper bound value) and values equalling the lower bound of the following decile (ie, inclusive of the lower bound value). HAQ Index=Healthcare

2016 (figure 3). Locations that scored approximately 90 or 
higher on the HAQ Index had generally high scores 
across broader causes, including vaccine-preventable dis-
eases, infectious diseases and maternal and child health, 
and causes that require complex case management 
(eg, epilepsy, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease). 
Nonetheless, many of these countries had lower scores 
for cancers and some non-communicable diseases. 
Greater heterogeneity occurred across causes for countries 
that scored below 90 on the HAQ Index, though many 
locations achieved greater consistency, and high scores, 
for vaccine-preventable diseases and gastrointestinal 
causes for which surgery could avert death. For these 
countries, a mixture of relatively low values on cancers 
and some non-communicable diseases, and then 
comparably better performance on other health areas, was 
commonplace. Among countries with lower HAQ Index 
scores in 2016 (ie, lower than approximately 50), most 
fared poorly across health areas and recorded particularly 
low scores on cancers, some infectious causes like 
tuberculosis, and maternal and child health. Nonetheless, 
many still exceeded a score of 90 for some causes 
(eg, diphtheria, upper respiratory infections).
Progress on personal health-care access and quality
Although global gaps between the highest and low 
est 
HAQ Index values slightly widened over time (from 76·4 in 
1990 to 78·5 in 2016), changes by SDI quintile showed 
more diverse trends (figure 4A). Low-middle-SDI countries 
saw some differences increase since 1990, with HAQ 
Index scores ranging from 29·0 to 67·2 by 2016. 
Conversely, disparities considerably narrowed among 
middle-SDI countries from 1990 (a 46·8-point difference) 
to 2016 (a 30·6-point difference). Among countries with 
subnational HAQ Index estimates (figure 4B), there was 
variation in when and how much local inequalities 
changed. In the USA, state-level differences decreased 
since 1990, but then comparably little progress occurred 
from 2000 to 2016. On the other hand, in Japan, absolute 
differences between prefectures narrowed to a 4·8-point 
difference between 2000 and 2016. In England, disparities 
slightly increased since 1990, from a 13·7-point difference 
in 1990, to a 16·9-point difference in 2016. China’s overall 
gains quickened since 2000, though absolute differences 
between Chinese provinces remained high in 2016 
(a 43·5-point gap). Mexico’s progress on the HAQ Index 
was much faster from 1990 to 2000, than from 2000 to 2016, 
although absolute inequalities somewhat narrowed by 
2016 (ie, a 20·9-point difference to a 17·0-point difference). 
Brazil’s state-level disparities slightly widened after 2000, 
rising from an absolute difference of 17·2 in 1990, 
to 20·4 in 2016. However, compared with Mexico, Brazil’s 
overall progress was more consistent across time periods. 
Although India’s improvements on the HAQ Index 
hastened from 2000 to 2016, the gap between the country’s 
highest and lowest scores widened (23·4-point difference 
in 1990, and 30·8-point difference in 2016).
From 1990 to 2016, 186 of 195 countries and territor 
ies 
significantly increased their HAQ Index score, with 
several middle-SDI countries, including China, the 
Maldives, Equatorial Guinea, Peru, and Thailand achiev-
ing among the most pronounced gains (table 2; 
appendix p 130). South Korea, Taiwan (Province of China), 
and Cyprus  recorded the largest improvements among 
high-SDI countries, and Lebanon, Turkey, and Saudi 
Arabia had the most progress for high-middle-SDI 
countries. For many low-middle-SDI and low-SDI coun-
tries, advances in the HAQ Index either primarily took 
place or accelerated from 2000 to 2016 (figure 5; 
appendix pp 133–35). Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan, 
Figure 2: Map of HAQ Index values for selected subnational locations in 2016
Deciles are based on the distribution of HAQ Index values for countries and territories in 2016 (as shown in 
figure 1), and then applied for subnational locations. Where lower and upper bounds of deciles appear to overlap, 
they should be interpreted as values up to but not equalling the upper bound in the preceding decile (ie, exclusive 
of the upper bound value) and values equalling the lower bound of the following decile (ie, inclusive of the lower 
bound value). HAQ Index=Healthcare Access and Quality Index.

Cambodia, and Laos (low-middle SDI), and Rwanda and 
Ethiopia (low SDI), exemplified this trend. Some 
countries in eastern Europe and central Asia (eg, Russia, 
Belarus, Kazakhstan) also experienced substantive 
progress from 2000 to 2016, after stalled gains or falter-
ing performance from 1990 to 2000. A sub 
set of countries, 
including Vietnam and Nepal, rec 
orded more comparable 
rates of change for each time period, whereas others, 
including several countries in Latin America and the 
Caribbean (eg, Guatemala, Mexico, Dominican Republic; 
table 2, appendix pp 133–35), had much slower progress 
after making considerable gains from 1990 to 2000. 
Nine countries, all low-to-middle SDI, did not record 
significant increases from 1990 to 2016. Table 2 and the 
appendix (pp 158–64) provide estimates of HAQ Index 
values, as well as absolute change and annualised rates of 
change for 1990–2000, 2000–16, and 1990–2016.
Focusing on 2000–16, examining improvement across 
health areas highlights a mixture of progress and 
potential for worsening performance if past trends are 
not addressed (appendix pp 136–41). Across locations, 
the largest gains primarily took place for vaccine-
prevent 
able diseases (eg, measles), some infectious 
diseases (eg, diarrhoeal diseases), some cancers (eg, 
leukaemia), and some non-communicable diseases. 
Such advances were most pronounced among coun-
tries that also recorded substantive increases in their 
overall HAQ Index (eg, China, Turkey). At the same 
time, many low-to-middle SDI countries experienced 
relatively few gains across most non-communicable 
diseases. Further 
more, countries with minimal pro-
gress on overall HAQ Index performance had com-
paratively small advances, even for health areas in 
which improvements have been more widespread. The 
main exception was vaccine-preventable diseases, 
especially measles, for low-SDI to middle-SDI countries 
(appendix pp 136–41).
Correlates of HAQ Index performance 
Although total health spending per capita was strongly 
correlated with HAQ Index performance in 2016 
(r=0·94; figure 6), large variation existed at similar 
spending levels. For instance, some countries with 
HAQ Index scores between 40 and 70 spent at least 
three times more than did peers with similar 
performance. Govern 
ment spending as a fraction of 
total health spending had positive, albeit moderate, 
correlation with HAQ Index performance in 2016 
(r=0·76; appendix p 145), whereas develop 
ment assist 
-
ance for health showed an opposite pattern (r=–0·71; 
appendix p 147). Country-level HAQ Index scores in 
2016 were positively associ 
ated with physicians, nurses, 
and midwives per 1000 (r=0·79), and similar, though 
more moderate, corre 
lations were found for hospital 
beds per 1000 and utilisation (appendix pp 149–52). 
Nonetheless, sizeable heterogeneity emerged across

to the HAQ Index, particularly among middle-to-high 
SDI countries. All correlations and additional figures 
are in the appendix (pp 142–52, 165).
Discussion
Summary of findings
Amid gains on personal health-care access and quality, 
striking disparities remained regarding HAQ Index 
scores achieved by 2016, and how quickly locations 
improved over time. In 2016, HAQ Index performance 
diverged along the development spectrum, ranging 
from more than 97 in Iceland to less than 20 in the 
Central African Republic and Somalia. Subnational 
inequalities were particularly pronounced in China 
and India, although high-income countries, including 
England and the USA, also saw considerable local gaps 
in performance. The global pace of progress accel-
erated from 2000 to 2016, a trend fuelled by many 
low-SDI and low-middle-SDI countries in sub-
Saharan Africa and southeast Asia. By contrast, several 
countries saw slowed or minimal improvement from 
2000 to 2016 after recording larger gains from 1990 
to 2000. Examining patterns in broader causes 
unveiled considerable heterogeneity in country-level 
im 
prove 
ments across health areas. These findings, 
coupled with the variable relationships between 
national HAQ Index values and potential correlates of 
per 
formance, underscore the complexities of orienting 
health systems toward providing access to quality 
services across health needs and along continuums 
of care.
Inequalities in personal health-care access and quality 
within countries
Our subnational assessment of HAQ Index per-
formance shows the importance of monitoring health-
care gaps and gains at more local levels. Further, 
because some factors might be more uniform because 
of country-level policy or health-care characteristics 
(eg, national insurance schemes, federally-maintained 
referral sys 
tems), this analysis offers the opportunity to 
consider if or how challenges in access and quality are 
experienced within countries. For instance, Mexico’s 
subnational differ 
ences could be more related to state-
level vari 
ations in quality given the country’s concerted 
efforts to expand access and service coverage through 
a tiered insurance system.42,43 Similar factors might 
under 
lie disparities in England, where the National 
Health Service ought to minimise financial barriers to 
accessing health care.30 Nonetheless, other obstacles 
probably exist, including inadequate utilisation of 
care across Mexican states,44 and local variations in 
health funding45 or human resource constraints within 
England.46 Striking disparities in China and India 
might represent myriad factors, including large vari-
ations in physical access to health facilities, health 
system infrastructure and scale-up of medical tech-
nologies, and provision of effective services across 
continuums of care. Brazil’s universal health coverage-
focused initiatives, includ 
ing expanding community-
based health programmes and governance functions, 
seem to have contributed to local reductions in 
amenable mortality from 2000 to 2012.14 However, state-
level progress on the HAQ Index was generally 
faster from 1990 to 2000 than from 2000 to 2016, 
suggest 
ing that advances in access might not always 
be accompanied by improved quality of care ac 
ross 
health services, especially for non-communicable 
dis 
eases. State-level differences in the USA could be

Pace of past progress and strengthening health systems 
for the next generation
Current HAQ Index estimates represent the culmination 
of past health-care policy actions, and thus offer an 
important entry point for strengthening health systems 
for the future. Recent demographic and epidemiological 
trends point to populations living longer and with higher 
disease burden worldwide,48 portending an escalation 
of health-care challenges if countries cannot more 
expediently shift their models of care away from reactive 
service delivery and toward more proactive continuums 
of care. Such action must be accompanied by efforts 
to further bolster public health programmes and pol-
icies, targeting risk factors and socioeconomic factors 
that are less directly amenable to health care but re-
main leading contributors to preventable disease burden 
(eg, smoking).16
Historically, global health priorities centred on a sub-
set of health services (ie, vaccine-preventable diseases, 
infectious diseases, and maternal and child health), which 
was particularly true during the Millennium Development 
Goal (MDG) era. Successes in scaling up vaccine cover-
age, early diagnosis and treatment of infectious dis-
ease (eg, antibiotics for lower respiratory infections), 
and improving access to and quality of maternal care 
and delivery are illustrated by accelerated HAQ Index 
performance for many low-to-middle SDI countries from 
2000 to 2016. The exact drivers of these improvements vary 
by context (eg, Timor-Leste emerged from years of conflict 
in the late 1990s; political strife and HIV devastated health 
systems throughout sub-Saharan Africa during the 1990s 
and early 2000s), but some combination of domestic 
policy action and increased development assistance for 
health might have hastened progress in many countries.49
In parallel, poor access to or quality of non-communicable 
disease-focused risk man 
agement and treatment could 
explain slower gains or minimal advances for these causes 
in many countries, a warning sign that health systems are 
not evolving at the same rate as changing population 
health needs. For non-communicable diseases, there was a 
strong divide in performance among high-SDI countries 
and low-to-middle SDI locations, potentially reflecting 
inadequate investments in advancing non-communicable 
disease services across continuums of care, integrating 
care across health areas, or some combination of both. The 
importance of, and potential for, improving non-
communicable disease prevention and treatment is shown 
by trends from eastern Europe and central Asia,50,51 where 
several countries saw substantive HAQ Index gains from 
2000 to 2016 after stagnation or worsening performance 
during the 1990s.
Gains made against vaccine-preventable diseases and 
other causes prioritised during the MDGs must be 
sustained going forward, but not at the expense of 
preparing health systems for the next generation. Amid 
shifting epidemiological profiles,48 countries including 
China, Turkey, Vietnam, and Nepal recorded consistently 
sizeable rates of progress on the HAQ Index from 
Figure 6: Comparing the HAQ Index in 2016 to the log of cumulative total health spending per capita, 2010–15
Total health spending per capita is based on the cumulative per capita spending from 2010 to 2015 in purchasing power parity (PPP) for 2017. Countries and territories 
are colour-coded by their SDI quintile, and are abbreviated according to their ISO3 codes, which are listed in the appendix (pp 90–95). HAQ Index=Healthcare Access

1990 to 2000, and 2000 to 2016. Such trends could reflect 
several factors (eg, health system structures, govern-
ance functions, health insurance expansion),52–55 but also 
could represent successes in re-orienting and integrating 
services to accommodate evolving health-care needs.56
Finally, some countries did not experience such catalytic 
effects during the MDGs and are at risk of falling 
further behind in the SDG era. These locations include 
the Central African Republic, Somalia, and South Sudan, 
which consistently recorded among the lowest HAQ Index 
scores over time; and Zimbabwe and Lesotho, countries 
that have struggled to recover from faltering performance 
during the 1990s and early 2000s. Again, the precise factors 
underlying these countries’ challenges are multifaceted, 
but commonalities include prolonged conflict, widespread 
poverty, and comparatively low levels of development 
assistance for health from development partners.39
Progress towards universal health coverage
Providing access to quality health care is a key component 
of universal health coverage, and the HAQ Index offers a 
robust metric for monitoring progress across health 
service areas. This strength is particularly important since 
achieving universal health coverage is an objective for 
countries across the development spectrum, and thus 
comparable measures are needed for benchmarking 
progress and identifying specific health areas for policy 
action.57 For instance, gains in performance on neonatal 
disorders generally lagged behind those of maternal 
disorders in many low-to-middle SDI countries, which 
suggests that greater investment across the continuum of 
care, from antenatal services to neonatal intensive care 
units, might support faster progress.58 Access to quality 
health care is necessary but far from sufficient for 
achieving universal health coverage, which also requires 
provision of care without financial hardship and en-
compasses services that do not explicitly avert death or 
fully treat specific health conditions (eg, family planning 
services, palliative care).59,60 Substantial debate exists 
around the effects of national insurance schemes and 
government health spending on improving access to high-
quality health care and overall universal health cover-
age. Our exploratory analyses point to positive, albeit 
heterogeneous, relationships between total and govern-
ment health spending and national HAQ Index scores. 
These results highlight the importance of dedicated 
financing for improving health-care access and quality, but 
also indicate that increased health financing alone is not 
adequate. Instead, how well health spending translates into 
heightened access to quality health care is prob 
ably shaped 
by many factors,61 including health system governance,2 
efficiencies with which financial and health-care resources 
are dispersed,62 and relative distrib 
utions of health system 
inputs across service areas and subnational locations.63 
Future work should assess the potential effect of 
improvements across these dimensions on advances in 
health-care access and quality.
Future directions for measuring health-care access and 
quality
With its annual cycle, the GBD study supports ongoing 
methodological and conceptual improvements for meas-
uring personal health-care access and quality. One priority 
area, which has been extensively debated, is determining 
how to best update the amenable cause list, both for fatal 
and non-fatal outcomes. One approach would entail a 
systematic review of GBD causes to identify intervention 
effectiveness by cause and then empirically establish 
thresholds at which health care significantly improves 
defined outcomes. Another approach could be to establish 
key health service areas to be represented by the HAQ 
Index and then selecting a set of amenable outcomes, fatal 
and non-fatal, to characterise each health area.57 The 
Nolte and McKee list of causes6–9 includes a range of 
important areas, but how well performance in these high-
priority areas reflects performance in others (eg, vision 
and hearing, trauma services) is not clear.
Using MIRs for cancers instead of risk-standardised 
death rates provided an improved indicator of country-
level differences in access to effective cancer care. The 
quantity and quality of cancer-registry data in GBD 2016 
supported our use of cancer MIRs, but broader MIR use 
might be limited by the sparsity of data and methodological 
demands (eg, reconciling long lag times between disease 
detection and death from causes like diabetes). Future 
iterations should consider whether and how to expand the 
application of MIRs to more GBD causes, particularly 
those where disease-specific registries or surveillance exist 
(eg, renal registries). Revisiting age dimensions related to 
amenable mortality is also warranted, because the current 
limit of 74 years, as defined by Nolte and McKee,6–9 for 
most causes might not fully represent the potential of 
health care to avert death after that age. However, whether 
age-group bounds should be determined by changes in life 
expectancy or age-specific improvements in survival, or 
demarcated by cause-specific advances in reducing 
mortality by age group is not immediately clear. Relatedly, 
age-specific HAQ Index analyses might provide a better 
understanding of how health-care access and quality varies 
across the lifespan. Such work could shed light on how 
well health systems are responding to broader demographic 
shifts and population ageing.64,65
Future work also should seek to disentangle the effects 
of access from quality on HAQ Index performance. We 
found that the HAQ Index was strongly correlated with 
total health spending, but it is not clear how more spending 
on health culminates in improved access (eg, investments 
in health-care infrastructure, financing national insurance 
schemes) versus quality (eg, funding training in effective 
medical care, purchase and maintenance of functional 
medical supplies). Further, the relative effect of improved 
access to, as compared with quality of, health care could 
vary by therapeutic area and the optimal levels of care. For 
instance, good access to hospitals with skilled medical 
personnel and functional surgical equip 
ment without

corresponding access to high-quality primary care could 
have more negative ramifications for vaccine-preventable 
diseases than for conditions mainly addressed by surgery. 
Strengthening the overall continuum of care,66 by and 
across health areas, also warrants prioritisation, since 
efforts to better align primary and specialty care could 
enhance both patient outcomes and systems efficiency.
Going forward, we aim to incorporate improvements in 
measuring health-care access and quality into more 
comprehensive assessments of health system performance. 
Expanding HAQ Index estimation to subnational locations 
directly supports this endeavour, and ongoing work to 
quantify human resources for health and financial risk 
protection within the broader GBD study support the 
assessment of other health system domains. Quanti-
fying inequalities in health system responsiveness re-
quires additional attention if the World Health Report 
2000 framework is to be replicated,1 emphasising the need 
to better parse out the effects of improving quality of care 
versus access. Additionally, combining the HAQ Index 
with measures that reflect the effect of interventions on 
risk factors modifiable by public health programmes 
(eg, child growth failure) could provide a better assessment 
of overarching health-system action. Finally, substantial 
interest exists in translating HAQ Index scores into 
coverage of populations or number of people with access 
to quality health services. Multiplying HAQ Index values by 
population could approximate this (ie, the 0–100 scale 
approximates 0–100%), and the strong correlation between 
PCA-derived HAQ Index scores and the arithmetic mean 
of its component parts (r=0·99; appendix p 153) suggests 
that results might not be overly sensitive to index con-
struction methods.
Comparison with GBD 2015 assessment of personal 
health-care access and quality
Compared with GBD 2015,20 GBD 2016 HAQ Index scores 
are slightly higher for high-SDI countries and lower 
for low-to-middle SDI countries, whereas changes in 
overall rankings followed less consistent SDI patterns 
(appendix pp 154–55). Although individual country-level 
changes might represent several factors (eg, availability of 
new vital registration data, improved cause-specific 
modelling), the use of MIRs for cancers, and thus their 
increased contribution to overall HAQ Index scores, was a 
main contributor. In GBD 2015, many lower-SDI countries 
received relatively high scores for cancers,20 whereas 
conditionalising cancer mortality on incidence resulted in 
a distinct SDI gradient (appendix p 96–111). Subsequently, 
we view these results as substantially improved since 
GBD 2015.
Limitations
Our analysis is subject to limitations beyond those already 
described. First, any limitations in GBD 2016 cause-of-
death estimation are also applicable to this study.27 For 
GBD 2016, we aimed to better account for cause-of-death 
data quality by developing a metric for well-certified 
deaths and using this measure to inform GBD data 
standardisation and correction processes. Nonethe-
less, establishing and maintaining high-quality vital 
registration systems is essential to improved cause-of-
death estimation. For instance, abrupt or prolonged 
conflict can lead to cause-of-death data gaps or lags in 
reporting; subsequently, HAQ Index performance might 
not yet fully capture the ramifications of conflict on health 
care in some locations. Second, continued updates to 
the GBD comparative risk assessment improved risk-
standardisation of amenable causes, but we might not 
account for all possible differences in mortality related to 
underlying risk exposure. Third, our scaling approach 
(ie, transforming each cause to a scale of 0–100) does not 
allow for the potential for additional improvements 
in reducing cause-specific mortality. How to establish 
empirically-derived lower bounds for each cause remains 
unclear, but future work should consider the use of 
alternative scaling methods. Fourth, the HAQ Index does 
not expressly capture possible effects of personal health 
care on causes without substantial mortality. Although 
performance on these causes might be well correlated 
with the current HAQ Index formulation, their inclusion 
could strengthen overall measurement. Fifth, the HAQ 
Index does not explicitly distinguish between the effects of 
primary and secondary care,66 though some causes might 
give a stronger signal on certain health-system dimensions 
(eg, surgical intervention for appendicitis). Improved 
performance in particular therapeutic areas might 
represent a combination of advances in primary care 
(eg, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension) and 
secondary or referral services (eg, stroke unit, cardiology), 
or overall gains in continuums of care. Finally, our 
exploratory analysis of HAQ Index performance did not 
account for all potential factors related to health-care 
access and quality; future work should consider how other 
dimensions of health financing and health care are 
associated with the HAQ Index (eg, catastrophic health 
spending, insurance coverage), as well as broader social 
determinants of health (eg, poverty, accessibility).67
Conclusions
The global ambition towards universal health coverage 
by 2030 necessitates ensuring that all populations have 
good access to quality health services. Progress is 
possible, as shown by accelerated gains on the HAQ 
Index for many low-SDI countries during the MDG era. 
However, such advances are not inevitable, as under-
scored by slowed improvements in several countries and 
for non-communicable diseases that are best targeted by 
quality services coordinated across continuums of care. 
Large geographical inequalities persist across and within 
countries, highlighting an urgent need for policy 
attention toward places at risk of being left behind. 
Current performance represents action from the past, 
and thus the pace of progress could accelerate for many

middle-to-low SDI countries if recent investments can be 
translated into health-care gains. To strengthen and 
deliver health systems for the next generation, national 
and international health agencies alike must focus on 
improving health-care access and quality across health 
service areas and reaffirm their commitment to 
accelerating progress for the world’s poorest populations.
