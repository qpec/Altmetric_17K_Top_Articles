Background
Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries, affecting 190 million children
under five years of age and leading to many adverse health consequences, including death. Based on prior evidence and a previous
version of this review, the World Health Organization has continued to recommend vitamin A supplementation for children aged 6
to 59 months. There are new data available from recently published randomised trials since the previous publication of this review in
2010, and this update incorporates this information and reviews the evidence.
Objectives
To assess the effects of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) for preventing morbidity and mortality in children aged six months to five
years.
Search methods
In March 2016 we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, six other databases, and two trials registers. We also checked
reference lists and contacted relevant organisations and researchers to identify additional studies.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs evaluating the effect of synthetic VAS in children aged six months to five years
living in the community. We excluded studies involving children in hospital and children with disease or infection. We also excluded
studies evaluating the effects of food fortification, consumption of vitamin A rich foods, or beta-carotene supplementation.
Data collection and analysis
For this update, two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and abstracted data, resolving discrepancies by discussion.
We performed meta-analyses for outcomes, including all-cause and cause-specific mortality, disease, vision, and side effects. We used
the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

 Main results
We identified 47 studies (4 of which are new to this review), involving approximately 1,223,856 children. Studies took place in 19
countries: 30 (63%) in Asia, 16 of these in India; 8 (17%) in Africa; 7 (15%) in Latin America, and 2 (4%) in Australia. About one-
third of the studies were in urban/periurban settings, and half were in rural settings; the remaining studies did not clearly report settings.
Most of the studies included equal numbers of girls and boys and lasted about a year. The included studies were at variable overall risk
of bias; however, evidence for the primary outcome was at low risk of bias. A meta-analysis for all-cause mortality included 19 trials
(1,202,382 children). At longest follow-up, there was a 12% observed reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality for vitamin A compared
with control using a fixed-effect model (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.93; high-quality evidence). This
result was sensitive to choice of model, and a random-effects meta-analysis showed a different summary estimate (24% reduction: RR
0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88); however, the confidence intervals overlapped with that of the fixed-effect model. Nine trials reported
mortality due to diarrhoea and showed a 12% overall reduction for VAS (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98; 1,098,538 participants;
high-quality evidence). There was no significant effect for VAS on mortality due to measles, respiratory disease, and meningitis. VAS
reduced incidence of diarrhoea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.87; 15 studies; 77,946 participants; low-quality evidence) and measles
(RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.67; 6 studies; 19,566 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, there was no significant effect
on incidence of respiratory disease or hospitalisations due to diarrhoea or pneumonia. There was an increased risk of vomiting within
the first 48 hours of VAS (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.69; 4 studies; 10,541 participants; moderate-quality evidence).
Authors’ conclusions
Vitamin A supplementation is associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in morbidity and mortality in children. Therefore,
we suggest maintaining the policy of universal supplementation for children under five years of age in populations at risk of VAD.
Further placebo-controlled trials of VAS in children between six months and five years of age would not change the conclusions of this
review, although studies that compare different doses and delivery mechanisms are needed. In populations with documented vitamin
A deficiency, it would be unethical to conduct placebo-controlled trials.

Vitamin A supplementation for preventing disease and death in children aged six months to five years
Background
Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries, affecting 190 million children
under five years of age. VAD predisposes children to increased risk of a range of problems, including respiratory diseases, diarrhoea,
measles, and vision problems, and it can lead to death. Previous studies show that giving synthetic vitamin A to children aged six
months to five years who are at risk of VAD can reduce the risk of death and some diseases.
Review question
This review aims to evaluate the effect of synthetic vitamin A supplementation (VAS) compared to placebo (dummy pill) or no
intervention for preventing illness and death in children aged six months to five years.
Review methods
We searched different databases that contain both published and unpublished results of medical studies. We included only randomised
control trials (RCTs: a study in which participants are randomly allocated to one or more treatments); these are considered the best
form of experimental studies in research literature. We combined the results mathematically to obtain overall estimates of effectiveness
of VAS against illness and death. The literature search is current to March 2016.
Study characteristics
This review includes 47 RCTs representing 1,223,856 children. Studies took place in 19 countries: 30 (63%) in Asia, 16 of which were
in India; 8 (17%) in Africa; 7 (15%) in Latin America, and 2 (4%) in Australia. The average age of children was about 33 months.
Most of the studies included equal numbers of boys and girls and lasted about a year. The quality of the included studies was variable;
however, it was unlikely that death rates were influenced by potential errors in the conduct of the studies.
Key results

 Data on the effect of VAS for the prevention of death were available from 19 of the included studies, and the combined results indicate
that vitamin A reduces overall risk of death and death due to diarrhoea by 12%. Vitamin A does not specifically reduce death due to
measles, respiratory infections, or meningitis, but it can reduce new occurrences of diarrhoea and measles. Giving oral synthetic vitamin
A to children at risk of VAD reduces the risk of night blindness. It also improves levels of vitamin A in their blood. The only reported
side effect was risk of vomiting within 48 hours of taking vitamin A in large doses, as recommended by the World Health Organization.
Quality of evidence
We rated the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach, which considers methodological flaws within studies,
consistency in reporting of results across studies, extent to which results apply to other settings, and effectiveness of treatments. Based
on these criteria, we judged the overall quality of the evidence to be high for benefits of VAS against overall risk of death and death
due to diarrhoea. For the rest of the outcomes, we rated the evidence as low or moderate. One large, recently conducted study, which
included about 1 million children, did not show any effect of VAS; however, when this study was combined with other, well-conducted
studies, VAS still had beneficial effects for the prevention of death and illness. In summary, VAS can reduce risk of illness and death in
children aged 6 to 59 months of age who are at risk of VAD.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate quality: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different.
Low quality: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low quality: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect
aBased on control group mortality risk in DEVTA trial 2013.
bWe acknowledge that the addition of DEVTA trial 2013 results decreased the overall effect size for this outcome compared
to previous analysis for this review. However, we think that vitamin A has robust effects on mortality as the direction of effect
is in favour of intervention in most of the studies and summary estimate remains statistically significant irrespective of the
use of random- or fixed-effect models for meta-analysis.
cDowngraded 1 level due to serious risk of bias of included studies in analysis (concerns with randomisation procedures,

dDowngraded 1 level due to serious imprecision (wide CIs around the pooled effect estimate suggest both appreciable benefit
and harm with vitamin A).
eBased on control event rate in Chowdhury 2002.
f Downgraded 1 level due to serious inconsistency (I2 was 94%, and the results of Herrera 1992; Cheng 1993 and Chowdhury

Description of the condition
Vitamin A is required for normal functioning of the visual sys-
tem, maintenance of cell function for growth, epithelial integrity,
red blood cell production, immunity, and reproduction (Sommer
1996). Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) impairs body functions and
may cause death. Adverse health consequences may also include
xerophthalmia (dry eyes), susceptibility to infection, stunting, and
anaemia (Sommer 1996; Rice 2004). Chronic VAD may develop
when animal sources and fortified foods are limited, for example
in diets that rely heavily on vegetables and fruits (Ramakrishnan
2002). In poor societies, especially in low-income countries, di-
etary deficiency can begin very early in life, when colostrum is
discarded or when breastfeeding is inadequate (Haskell 1999).
VAD is interconnected with a deprived ecological, social, and
economic environment. People with VAD may be exposed to
measles, diarrhoea, and respiratory diseases (Sommer 2002; Rice
2004). When these problems are comorbid, depressed appetite
and poor absorption may lower intake of vitamin A, while exces-
sive metabolism and excretion may deplete body stores (Alvarez
1995; Mitra 1998). This combination of poor diet and infection
leads to a vicious cycle that particularly affects young children and
pregnant or lactating mothers (Sommer 2002; West 2003).
VAD is common in low- and middle-income countries. About
19.1 million pregnant women and 190 million children under
five years of age are vitamin A deficient (i.e. serum retinol less
than 0.70 µmol/L), representing about 33% of children under
five years of age in populations at risk of VAD (WHO 2009).
Based on biochemical VAD in young children, 122 countries have
a moderate to severe public health problem (WHO 2009).
Recent data on global trends in VAD suggest that it remains widely
prevalent in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (Stevens 2015),
while rates have significantly fallen in Southeast Asia and Latin
America (Stevens 2015). Deaths attributable to VAD have almost
disappeared in many regions of the world, suggesting the need to
revisit supplementation strategies according to population needs
(Stevens 2015).
Description of the intervention
Vitamin A is a term used for a subclass of retinoic acids, a family
of lipid-soluble compounds (Bates 1995). Vitamin A is found in
two main forms: provitamin A carotenoids and preformed vitamin
A. Provitamin A carotenoids are found in plants; beta-carotene
is the only one that is metabolised by mammals into vitamin A.
Though fruits and vegetables are nutritious in other ways, normal
dietary intake of plants may not deliver adequate amounts of vita-
min A because the intestinal carotenoid-to-retinol conversion ratio
varies with type of food, ranging from 6:1 to 26:1 (US Institute of
Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board; Van Lieshout 2005). Con-
sequently, VAD can exist in places with high vegetable and fruit
consumption (West 2002). Preformed vitamin A (retinol, retinal,
retinoic acid, and retinyl esters), is the most active form of vita-
min A and is found in animal sources. Supplements usually use
preformed vitamin A (Shenai 1993; Bates 1995).
How the intervention might work
Vitamin A is an essential nutrient; it cannot be synthesised by
the human body and must therefore come from dietary sources
(Bates 1995). Oral vitamin A supplementation (VAS) and food
fortification are the most direct methods for providing vitamin A
to people whose diets are deficient.
Vitamin A has been described as an anti-infectious vitamin be-
cause of its role in regulating human immune function (Green
1928). Earlystudiesinanimalsandhumansrevealedanassociation
between VAD and increased susceptibility to infections (Semba
1999). In addition to its preventive and therapeutic effect against
xerophthalmia (Sommer 1996), prophylactic VAS in apparently
healthy children (over six months of age) residing in developing
countries may reduce childhood mortality by as much as 30%
(Beaton 1993; Fawzi 1993; Glasziou 1993), particularly by reduc-
ing diarrhoea and measles mortality.
Side effects of VAS are rare in children aged six months or older;
however, vitamin A toxicity can develop if large amounts of vita-
min A are used over a prolonged period of time. Symptoms of tox-
icity include liver damage, headaches, vomiting, skin desquama-
tion, bone abnormalities, joint pain, and alopecia (Smith 1976). A
very high single dose can also cause transient acute toxic symptoms
that may include a bulging fontanelle in children under one year,
headaches, vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, and irritability.
Toxicity from ingestion of food sources with preformed vitamin
A is rare (Hathcock 1997).
Why it is important to do this review
This update considers new evidence that has become available
since the publication of the original review (Imdad 2010a). Given
the changes in global epidemiology and mortality related to VAD
(Stevens 2015), this update with newer studies is necessary to
evaluate the need for continued VAS programmes. A separate
Cochrane Review has evaluated the therapeutic role of vitamin
A for measles (Yang 2005), while another has focused on non-
measles pneumonia (Ni 2005). Different Cochrane Reviews in a
variety of subpopulations of children and mothers are also eval-
uating the prophylactic role of vitamin A (Van den Broek 2002;
Chen 2008; Bello 2009; Darlow 2011; Gogia 2011; Wiysonge
2011; Imdad 2016; Haider 2017).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-
RCTs evaluating the effect of synthetic VAS in children aged six
months to five years. We included data from the first period of
cross-over studies only. We considered studies for inclusion irre-
spective of publication status or language of publication.
We excluded quasi-RCTs with the exception of Herrera 1992
and Stansfield 1993; we made this decision post hoc (Differences
between protocol and review). Given the design of the interven-
tions and the placebos as well as steps to blind those administering
the sequence, we do not think these studies are meaningfully dif-
ferent from RCTs. Herrera 1992 assigned participants alternately
by household, while Stansfield 1993 used a random starting point
and alternating distribution of red or green pills. Lack of a truly
randomsequence wasnotrelatedtoothersourcesof bias(forexam-
ple, performance bias) because individuals delivering the capsules
had no ongoing contact with participants, and the manufacturer
(Roche) held the code until the study was completed. Though
post hoc, we made the decision to include these studies before
extracting data or conducting analyses; we conducted a sensitivity
analysis to determine if the decision had any impact on the re-
sults, which it did not (see ’Sensitivity analysis’ subheading, under
’Primary outcome: all-cause mortality’ in Effects of interventions
section).
Types of participants
Children living in the community and aged six months to five years
at the time of recruitment were eligible for inclusion. We excluded
children in hospital and children with disease or infection.
We contacted trial authors to determine if the study population
included some participants who were not eligible for this review
(for example, children over five years of age) and requested disag-
gregated data. If such data were not available, we included studies
if the majority of participants (51% or more) met the inclusion
criteria. If this could not be determined and the participants met
the inclusion criteria on average (for example, the mean age was
within the eligible range), then we included these trials.
Types of interventions
Synthetic oral VAS compared to either placebo or treatment-as-
usual control groups, including trials of various doses and frequen-
cies. Co-interventions (for example, multiple vitamin or mineral
supplementation), must have been identical in both groups. We
excluded studies evaluating the effects of food fortification, con-
sumption of foods rich in vitamin A, and beta-carotene supple-
mentation.
If a trial included more than one eligible intervention group (for
example, different doses), we combined the groups for the main
analysis, although we treated the groups separately for subgroup
analyses where appropriate. If a trial included multiple control
groups (for example, both placebo and treatment as usual), we
selected the control group that most closely replicated the non-
specific treatment of the intervention group (that is, placebo).
Types of outcome measures
We extracted data on the outcomes listed below. In studies report-
ing more than one measure of an outcome, we combined measures
for meta-analysis using the methods described in Data synthesis.
Primary outcomes
1. All-cause mortality.
Secondary outcomes
1. Cause-specific mortality due to:
i) diarrhoea;
ii) measles;
iii) meningitis; and
iv) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).
2. Cause-specific morbidity (i.e. incidence and prevalence)
due to:
i) diarrhoea;
ii) measles;
iii) malaria;
iv) meningitis;
v) LRTI;
vi) Bitot’s spots;
vii) night blindness;
viii) xerophthalmia; and
ix) hospitalisation.
3. Side effects (for example, vomiting or diarrhoea following
supplementation).
4. Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) status (based on serum retinol
level).
We combined pneumonia and LRTI outcomes post hoc. Pneu-
monia is a type of LRTI, and most of the studies did not test
for pneumonia specifically (using specific clinical criteria). In the
event a study reported both pneumonia and LRTI outcomes, we
extracted the LRTI outcome data to combine with other studies.

Searching other resources
We checked the reference lists of reviews and included and ex-
cluded studies in order to identify additional citations. We also
contacted organisations and researchers.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
For this update, two people (Aamer Imdad and Zunirah Ahmed)
independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion in the
review. We resolved differences of opinion about suitability for
inclusion by discussion and through consultation with a third
review author (Evan Mayo Wilson). We recorded our decisions in
a PRISMA diagram (Moher 2009).
Data extraction and management
For this update, two people (Aamer Imdad and Jai Das or Renee
Sharma) used a data extraction sheet to independently extract the
data below from each eligible study. Review authors resolved dis-
crepancies through discussion.
1. General:
i) year of study;
ii) location (country, urban/rural);
iii) method of recruitment;
iv) inclusion criteria;
v) unit of analysis; and
vi) risk of bias (see Assessment of risk of bias in included
studies).
2. Participants:
i) sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex); and
ii) comorbidities.
3. For each intervention and comparison group of interest:
i) dosage;
ii) duration;
iii) frequency; and
iv) co-intervention (if any).
4. For each outcome of interest:
i) time points collected and reported;
ii) definition;
iii) validity;
iv) unit of measurement (if relevant); and
v) loss to follow-up.
The main analyses included the longest reported follow-up in each
study. We grouped outcomes according to follow-up period (0 to
12 months; 13 to 60 months, and greater than 60 months since
randomisation); when trials reported multiple time points for a
period,we extractedthe longestoutcome interval ina givenperiod.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two people (Aamer Imdad and Jai Das or Renee Sharma) indepen-
dently assessed the risk of bias within each included study using
Cochrane’s ’Risk of bias’ tool (Higgins 2011a). For all studies, we
assessed the following: sequence generation; allocation conceal-
ment; blinding of participants and providers; blinding of outcome
assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome reporting;
and other sources of bias. We specifically looked for the possi-
bility of performance bias (differential treatment of the interven-
tion and control groups) and detection bias (for example, differ-
ential effort to locate death records for the intervention and con-
trol groups). Findings are discussed in the Risk of bias in included
studies section and included in the ’Risk of bias’ tables (beneath
the Characteristics of included studies tables).

 Measures of treatment effect
We measured morbidity in different ways, and we combined all
available data whenever possible. For example, for diarrhoea, we
included all types of diarrhoea (mild, moderate, and severe). In the
case of pneumonia, we included lower (but not upper) respiratory
tract infection.
To avoid reviewer bias, we predetermined the order of preference
for extracting outcomes when data were available in several for-
mats. For studies that randomised individuals, we gave preference
to data that required the least manipulation by authors or infer-
ence by reviewers. We extracted raw values (for example, means
and standard deviations) rather than calculated effect sizes (for ex-
ample, Cohen’s d). For mortality data, we gave preference to de-
nominators in the following order: number with definite outcome
known (or imputed as described below), number randomised, and
child-years. For other dichotomous outcomes to which both sur-
vivors and non-survivors may have contributed data (for example,
incidence of measles), we gave preference to child years, number
with definite outcome known, and number randomised.
In the case of cluster-RCTs, we used either adjusted estimates
reported by the trial authors or raw data, and we inflated the
standard error (SE) using the procedures described below in the
Unit of analysis issues section.
Unit of analysis issues
Cluster-randomised trials
In studies randomising units other than the individual (i.e. clus-
ters), trials should present results with controls for clustering (for
example, robust SEs or hierarchical linear models). We analysed
clustered data using the procedures outlined in Higgins 2011b.
Where results did not control for clustering, we contacted trial
authors to request an estimate of the intracluster correlation coef-
ficient (ICC). If the trial authors were unable to provide an ICC,
we calculated the ICC using design effects calculated previously
(Beaton 1993), and we estimated the ICC for studies that did
not publish a value (see section on ’Unit of randomisation’ under
Included studies). For estimated values, we conducted sensitivity
analyses using larger and smaller design effects to determine if the
results were robust (see Sensitivity analysis).
Multiple-arm trials
For multiple-arm trials, we grouped data so that the only difference
between the groups was VAS. For example, if a trial had four arms
(vitamin A plus zinc, zinc alone, vitamin A alone, and placebo),
we included it as two comparisons: vitamin A plus zinc versus
zinc alone and vitamin A alone versus placebo. In multiple-arm
trials using two different doses of vitamin A, we combined the two
groups to avoid double-counting the participants in the control
group.
Dealing with missing data
Differential dropout can lead to biased estimates of effect size, and
bias may arise if reasons for dropout differ across groups.
We described missing data, including dropouts and reasons for
dropout, when given. If data were missing for some cases, or if rea-
sons for dropout were not reported, we contacted the trial authors.
When analyses considered completers and controlled for dropout
(for example, imputed using regression methods), we extracted the
latter.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed included studies for clinical heterogeneity by com-
paring the distribution of important factors such as study par-
ticipants, study setting, dose, and duration of intervention and
co-interventions. We assessed methodological heterogeneity by
comparing data included in the ’Risk of bias’ tables (beneath the
Characteristics of included studies tables). We assessed statistical
heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots, the Chi2 test
(and P value), and the I2 statistic. If the P value was less than
0.10 and the I2 exceeded 50%, we considered heterogeneity to be
substantial. We also reported Tau2 - an estimate of between-study
variance.
Assessment of reporting biases
Toassessthe possibilityof small studybias, we drewfunnel plotsfor
outcomes with 10 or more studies and compared random-effects
estimates to the fixed-effect estimate (see Sensitivity analysis).
Data synthesis
We performed meta-analysis using Review Manager 5 (RevMan)
software (RevMan 2014). When data were in several formats that
we could not combine directly in RevMan, we used the generic
inverse variance (GIV) option. This was meant to handle the sce-
nario when only summary estimates (like the risk ratio, or RR)
were available and no numbers for nominators and denominators
were available to calculate the summary estimate. In this case, it
would not be possible to pool that study with other studies using
conventional methods. Hence, we used GIV, which does not re-
quire input of data in the form of nominators and denominators
of intervention and control group, but the log of effect size (e.g.
RR) and standard error (SE). For this update, we entered data into
the built-in calculator in RevMan to calculate the log of RR and
their SE.
We reported all outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and
weighted overall effects by the inverse of variance using a fixed-
effect model. Although there might be some differences across tri-
als (for example, dose, and population), the biological mechanism
should be similar. We explored differences through analyses de-
scribed elsewhere (Mayo-Wilson 2011).

Vitamin A supplementation for preventing morbidity and mortality in children from six months to five years of age (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the overall RR. For
incidence data, we combined RRs (events per child) and rate ratios
(events per child-year) because these ratios use the same scale and
can be interpreted in the same way for these studies (the duration
of studies was relatively short, i.e. median duration was one year
or less).
In some cases, we estimated time at risk, as when trial authors
reported incidence rate, duration of study, and number of children
in each group.
We decided post hoc that we would pool incidence and prevalence
data for morbidity separately. The primary difference between in-
cidence and prevalence data is time at risk. Incidence data covers
the time (prospectively) while prevalence data is a snapshot of a
condition at one point in time. Therefore, we thought that com-
bining incidence and prevalence data was not appropriate and so
decided not to pool together these two types of data.
For continuous outcomes we calculated Hedges g.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Effectiveness of the intervention may differ across members of
populations (for example, due to differences in baseline vitamin A
status) and may be affected by other interventions (for example,
immunisation or deficiency of other micronutrients). For exam-
ple, neonatal VAS is thought to have different effects in Asia versus
Africa (Klemm 2009). Unlike trial-level factors (such as dose), as-
sociations between individual-level moderators (such as VAS) and
outcomes should be analysed using individual patient data from
RCTs and observational studies. With two exceptions, we did not
include subgroup analyses based on individual-level moderators
in this review, as such analyses are at high risk of ecological fallacy
(for example, lack of variation between studies would not indi-
cate there was no variation within them). We included subgroups
of age and sex; trials commonly report separate effects for these
groups. We performed subgroup analyses when disaggregated data
were available for groups within studies or between studies.
The followingsubgroupanalyseswere prespecified, anddifferences
were tested using the Chi2 test in RevMan 2014.
1. Dose: standard (up to 100,000 IU for children aged 6 to 11
months, and 200,000 IU for children aged 12 months to five
years) versus high (greater than standard).
2. Frequency: high (doses more than once in six months)
versus low (one dose every six months or six-plus-month
interval).
3. Location: continent.
4. Age: six to 12 months versus one to five years.
5. Sex: boys versus girls.
Sensitivity analysis
We performed the following sensitivity analyses.
1. To test for bias, we repeated the primary analysis without
studies at high risk of bias for sequence generation.
2. To test for small study bias, we repeated the analysis using a
random-effects model (as the assumption for this model is that
effect is not identical across studies, and included studies are
considered a ’random’ sample of all the possible studies on the
topic) and drew funnel plots for all outcomes with 10 or more
studies.
3. To test the robustness of results when using imputed ICCs,
we conducted sensitivity analyses using larger and smaller design
effects (post hoc sensitivity analysis described under the ’Unit of
randomisation’ subheading in the Included studies section
below).
Summary of findings table
In collaboration with the Cochrane Editorial Unit, two review au-
thors (Aamer Imdad and Evan Mayo-Wilson) assessed the over-
all quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach (Guyatt
2011). The GRADE assessment was based on five criteria: limi-
tations in the design and implementation of available studies, im-
precision of results, inconsistency of results, indirectness of study
results, and publication bias.
We assessed the quality of the evidence as ’high’, ’moderate’, ’low’
or ’very low’ for each of the following outcomes: all-cause mor-
tality; mortality due to diarrhoea, measles, and LRTI; incidence
of diarrhoea, measles, LRTI, Bitot’s spots, and night blindness;
vomiting; and VAD status. We presented our quality ratings and
results in Summary of findings for the main comparison; our rea-
sons for the quality rating are available in footnotes of the table.

Description of studies
Results of the search
For this update, electronic searches identified 5236 records; 5228
records remained after duplicates were removed. From these we
identified 54 relevant citations and reviewed the full texts. We
excluded 25 irrelevant reports and a further 15 reports (10 studies)
that met the screening criteria but did not meet the full inclusion
criteria. For more information see the Excluded studies section.
We included four new studies from 10 reports; nine of these were
identified from the updated searches and one was carried forward
from the previous review where it was awaiting classification. We
also added five new reports to previously included studies (see
Included studies). See Figure 1.

Included studies
The previous version of this review included 43 studies from 91
reports (Imdad 2010a). This update includes four new studies
(from 10 reports) (Albert 2003; Chen 2013a and Chen 2013b
(one study); DEVTA trial 2013; Fisker 2014), one of which was
included in the previous review as awaiting classification (DEVTA
trial 2013). We also found five new reports of three studies in-
cluded the previous review (Sommer 1986; Long 2006a; Lima
2014), bringing the total included studies in this review to 47 (106
reports).
Of the included studies, there were three factorial design studies.
Factorial design studies typically test more than one intervention
in different combinations in a single study. For meta-analysis, we
included each such study as two discrete data sets (with interven-
tion and comparison group differentiated by vitamin A supple-
mentation only) and counted them as one study overall (Chen
2013a and Chen 2013b; Long 2006a and Long 2006b; Reddy
1986a and Reddy 1986b). Futher details are available below un-
der the subheading ’Multiple-arms trials’. More than one report
was available for 19 (40%) trials. Where multiple reports existed
for an included trial, we extracted data from all reports following
current guidelines (Higgins 2011b). Further information about
individual studies is available in the Characteristics of included
studies tables.
Forty-two trials (89%) reported data that could be included in a
meta-analysis; five trials reported either outcomes that were not
relevant to the review (Albert 2003; Cherian 2003), data that were
not available by group (Lima 2014), or data that were incomplete
(Van Agtmaal 1988; Smith 1999).
Sample size
Trials assigned approximately 1,223,856 participants, with sample
sizes ranging between 35 participants in Van Agtmaal 1988 to
approximately 1 million participants in DEVTA trial 2013. The

 42 trials that could be analysed included 1,223,607 participants
(99.9% of children included in the review).
The 11 largest studies randomised about 1,200,214 chil-
dren, 98.06% of participants in the review (Sommer 1986;
Rahmathullah 1990; Vijayaraghavan 1990; West 1991; Daulaire
1992; Herrera 1992; Ross 1993 SURVIVAL; Stansfield 1993;
Agarwal 1995; Pant 1996; DEVTA trial 2013).
Comparisons
Seven(14%)studiescomparedVAS totreatmentasusual (Sommer
1986; Van Agtmaal 1988; West 1991; Daulaire 1992; Pant 1996;
Donnen 1998; DEVTA trial 2013). Forty (85%) studies com-
pared VAS to placebo. One large trial reported not using a placebo
because it was forbidden by government (Sommer 1986).
Multiple-arm trials
Fifteen (31%) trials had multiple arms, nine of which were rele-
vant to this review (Reddy 1986a; Florentino 1990; Benn 1997;
Smith 1999; Rahman 2001; Long 2006a; Lin 2009; Chen 2013a;
DEVTA trial 2013).
Seven trials used factorial designs, combining vitamin A with other
treatments such as zinc (Smith 1999; Rahman 2001; Albert 2003;
Long 2006a), deworming (Reddy 1986a; DEVTA trial 2013),
or iron (Chen 2013a); we extracted data for comparisons that
differed only in the provision of vitamin A (for example, vitamin A
versus placebo; and vitamin A plus zinc versus zinc alone). In one
trial (Rahman 2001), raw data were not available, and we could
not identify outcome data for an eligible comparison. One study
combined different doses (Florentino 1990).
Unit of randomisation
Two studies randomised participants by household, and we treated
participants as if they were individually randomised (Herrera
1992; Stansfield 1993). We conducted a sensitivity analysis for all-
cause mortality using ICCs of 0 and 0.010 for studies estimating
the mean design effect.
We used previously reported design effects from Beaton 1993 to
calculate ICCs for clustered studies (Sommer 1986; Rahmathullah
1990; Vijayaraghavan 1990; West 1991; Daulaire 1992; Ross
1993 SURVIVAL). The ICCs were consistently around 0.002.
We imputed an ICC value of 0.002 for the single study that did
not account for clustering in the original analysis (DEVTA trial
2013).
Allocation ratio
Thirty-nine (83%) studies evenly allocated participants to the in-
tervention and control groups. In eight (17%) studies, the num-
ber assigned to each group was unclear (Reddy 1986a; Ross 1993
HEALTH; Ross 1993 SURVIVAL; Stansfield 1993; Biswas 1994;
Dibley 1996; Ramakrishnan 1995; Pant 1996).
Participants
There were 20 studies that categorically excluded participants with
clinical signs of VAD (like xerophthalmia, Bitot’s spots) while
23 studies did not clearly mention vitamin A. There were four
studies that allowed participants who had clinical signs of VAD
(Rahmathullah 1990; West 1991; Daulaire 1992; DEVTA trial
2013). Only one trial mentioned biochemical VAD as an inclu-
sion criterion (Albert 2003).
Location/setting
Studies took place in 19 countries: 30 (63%) in Asia, including 16
in India; 8 (17%) in Africa (Herrera 1992; Ross 1993 HEALTH;
Ross 1993 SURVIVAL; Stabell 1995; Benn 1997; Donnen 1998;
Shankar 1999; Fisker 2014); 7 (15%) in Latin America (Stansfield
1993; Barreto 1994; Sempertegui 1999; Smith 1999; Long 2006a;
Long 2007; Lima 2014), and 2 (4%) in Australia (Pinnock 1986;
Pinnock 1988). Eighteen (38%) studies were in urban/periurban
settings, and 26 (55%) were in rural settings. Three studies did
not explicitly describe their urban or rural setting.
Age
Twenty-one (44%) studies reported average age, which was 33
months across the studies.
Sex
Thirty-five (74%) studies reported sex. The majority assigned
approximately equal numbers of boys and girls. Three studies
favoured boys by more than 10% (Semba 1991; Ranjini 2001; Lin
2008). The median percentage of boys in the studies was 51%.
Time
There were 11 studies that continued for five years or more (
Vijayaraghavan 1990; West 1991; Herrera 1992; Dibley 1996;
Pant 1996; Shankar 1999; Chowdhury 2002; Long 2006a; Long
2007; DEVTA trial 2013; Ross 1993 SURVIVAL); the remainder
of the studies lasted about one year or less. In the event that a
single study reported data at more than one time point, we used
the data from the longest interval in the overall analysis.
Dose
All included studies used large doses of vitamin A in the range
of 50,000 IU to 200,000 IU (one IU = 0.3 mcg), depending
on the age of participants, except for five studies that used small
doses, that is, 3866 IU given three times a week (Pinnock 1988),
14

 8333 IU given once a week (Rahmathullah 1990), 10,000 IU
givenweekly(Sempertegui1999; Smith 1999), or25,000IUgiven
every two weeks (Chen 2013a and Chen 2013b; considered as
one study). Some studies had two different dosing regimens for
younger children (50,000 IU or 100,000 IU for ages 6 to 11
months) and older children (100,000 IU or 200,000 IU for ages
one year or older).
Frequency
Participants received the large doses (50,000 IU to 200,000 IU)
every four to six months, either once or more, depending on the
study duration. Studies that used smaller doses gave more frequent
doses as described above.
Route
Retinol palmitate was the most commonly used compound to de-
liver vitamin A, and all studies used the oral route for supplemen-
tation.
Excluded studies
Overall, we excluded 18 studies (23 reports) from this review. We
excluded 8 studies from a previous version of this review (Imdad
2010a), plus 10 others for this update. We list all excluded studies
in the Characteristics of excluded studies tables with reasons for ex-
clusion. Six studies had ineligible populations (Bloem 1990; Bahl
1997; Semba 2005; Fahmida 2007; Edmond 2012; Al-Mekhlafi
2014), five had ineligible controls (Chhagan 2010; Yakymenko
2011; Chen 2012; Kartasurya 2012; Owusu-Agyei 2013), three
had ineligible interventions (Semba 1990; Yang 2002; Ganon
2014), and four were not RCTs (Kothari 1991; Bhaskaram 1997;
Wu 2007; Nankabirwa 2011).
Studies awaiting assessment
We could not assess one trial reported in a conference abstract
(Aklamati 2006). It appeared to meet the inclusion criteria but
reported unclear results. For example, the study included 36 chil-
dren and reported an outcome of 1.2% of 17; though one child
out of 17 is nearly 6%. To the best of our knowledge, the com-
plete results have not been published as yet. See Characteristics of
studies awaiting classification table for more information.
Risk of bias in included studies
For each study, we assessed seven domains of methodological bias
listed in the Assessment of risk of bias in included studies section
and rated them as being at high, low or unclear risk. We described
our results below. Please also see Figure 2.

 Allocation
Sequence generation
All included studies were RCTs or quasi-RCTs. Twenty (42%)
studies specified the method of randomisation and were rated at
low risk of bias for sequence generation. Twenty-four studies were
at unclear risk. Three (6%) studies, including 42,660 participants
(3% of those included in the review), were at high risk of bias in
this domain (Herrera 1992; Stansfield 1993; Arya 2000). One of
these studies described assignment as random (Arya 2000), but
participants may have been assigned in order of arrival at hospital,
which would not qualify as truly random.
Allocation concealment
We judged one study to be at high risk of bias for allocation con-
cealment (Daulaire 1992), as authors reported in correspondence
that they had made no effort to conceal the allocation. We rated
25 studies (53%) at unclear risk of bias and 21 studies at low risk
of bias.
Blinding
Blinding of participants
Thirty-two (68%) studies described efforts to blind participants,
and we considered them to be at low risk of bias for blinding
of participants. We judged 3 studies to be at high risk of bias
(Daulaire 1992; Lin 2009; DEVTA trial 2013), and we deemed 12
(25%) studies to be at unclear risk of bias (Reddy 1986a; Sommer
1986; Van Agtmaal 1988; Agarwal 1995; Kartasasmita 1995;
Stabell 1995; Pant 1996; Donnen 1998; Smith 1999; Ranjini
2001; Chowdhury 2002; Cherian 2003).
Blinding of providers
In some trials, staff delivering the intervention also conducted
assessments. We considered 3 studies to be at high risk of bias
(Daulaire 1992; Lin 2009; DEVTA trial 2013), while the risk was
unclear in 13 (27%) studies (Reddy 1986a; Sommer 1986; Van
Agtmaal 1988; Agarwal 1995; Kartasasmita 1995; Stabell 1995;
Pant 1996; Donnen 1998; Smith 1999; Ranjini 2001; Chowdhury
2002; Cherian 2003; Lin 2008). We considered 31 (65%) studies
to be at low risk of bias for blinding of providers.
Blinding of outcome assessors
We assessed three (6%) studies to be at high risk of bias for blinding
of outcome assessors (Daulaire 1992; Lin 2009; DEVTA trial
2013), and the risk was unclear in 14 (30%) studies (Reddy 1986a;
Sommer 1986; Van Agtmaal 1988; Semba 1991; Agarwal 1995;
Kartasasmita 1995; Stabell 1995; Pant 1996; Donnen 1998; Smith
1999; Ranjini 2001; Chowdhury 2002; Cherian 2003; Lin 2008).
Thirty (63%) studies had low risk of bias.
Incomplete outcome data
For incomplete outcome data, we judged 26 (55%) studies to
be at low risk of bias. Of those remaining, we rated nine (19%)
studies to be at high risk of bias (Van Agtmaal 1988; Cheng 1993;
Kartasasmita 1995; Semba 1995; Pant 1996; Bahl 1999; Arya
2000; Chowdhury 2002; Cherian 2003), while risk was unclear
in 12 (25%) studies (Sinha 1976; Reddy 1986a; Sommer 1986;
Vijayaraghavan 1990; West 1991; Ross 1993 HEALTH; Ross
1993 SURVIVAL; Agarwal 1995; Stabell 1995; Venkatarao 1996;
Smith 1999; Ranjini 2001). The primary reason for a high risk
rating was a lack of explanation for attrition in intervention and
control group.
Selective reporting
Most of the trials in the review included multiple outcome mea-
sures, and positive results are more likely to be included in reports
than negative results. Only seven (14%) studies appeared to be free
of selective outcome reporting (Florentino 1990; Rahmathullah
1990; West 1991; Dibley 1996; Benn 1997; DEVTA trial 2013;
Fisker 2014). We judged 26 (55%) studies to be at unclear risk of
bias and 14 (29%) studies to be at high risk of bias (Pinnock 1988;
Van Agtmaal 1988; Vijayaraghavan 1990; Ross 1993 HEALTH;
Ross 1993 SURVIVAL; Stansfield 1993; Ramakrishnan 1995;
Pant 1996; Bahl 1999; Arya 2000; Cherian 2003; Lin 2008; Lin
2009; Lima 2014).
Most of the studies did not cite a published protocol, which is why
we assessed a large proportion of studies to be at unclear risk of
bias.
Other potential sources of bias
We extracted other potential sources of bias and noted them in
the Characteristics of included studies tables, but none were likely
to influence the results of the review in a meaningful way.

 Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison
We present the results for each outcome below, summarising the
main outcomes in Summary of findings for the main comparison.
We did not conduct all of our planned subgroup analyses. For the
primary outcome, only one study used a non-standard dose and
frequency. Other analyses with more than 10 studies contained
significantly fewer participants (for example, the analysis of serum
level included less than 7000 participants). Consequently, we did
not conduct subgroup analyses for dose and frequency because
the analyses were clearly underpowered, and any effects would be
attributable to chance. Results of the attempted subgroup analyses
are listed in Table 1. We performed sensitivity analyses for all-cause
mortality and incidence due to diarrhoea and vitamin A serum
levels only, as most analyses contained a small number of studies.
Primary outcome: all-cause mortality
Ninteen trials involved 1,202,382 children (98.25% of the chil-
dren included in the review) in an overall analysis (using data
from the last follow-up for trials measuring outcomes multiple
times)(Sommer1986; Rahmathullah 1990; Vijayaraghavan 1990;
West 1991; Daulaire 1992; Herrera 1992; Ross 1993 HEALTH;
Ross 1993 SURVIVAL; Barreto 1994; Agarwal 1995; Dibley
1996; Pant 1996; Venkatarao 1996; Benn 1997; Donnen 1998;
Chowdhury 2002; Lin 2008; DEVTA trial 2013; Fisker 2014).
One trial reported no events (Lin 2008).
Vitamin A was associated with a 12% reduction in all-cause mor-
tality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.93; Analysis 1.1; Figure 3),
though there was moderate heterogeneity (Chi2 = 44.00, degrees
of freedom (df) = 17; P < 0.001; I2 = 61%). We judged the quality
of this evidence to be high (see Summary of findings for the main
comparison).
Figure 3.
Forest plot of comparison: 1 Vitamin A versus Control, outcome: 1.1 All-cause mortality at
longest follow-up.
The effect during the first year postrandomisation was similar
based on data available from 13 studies (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75 to
0.92), and the statistical heterogeneity was similar (Chi2 = 34.29,
df = 12; P < 0.001; I2 = 65%). Only six (12%) studies measured
mortality between 13 and 59 months, and the effect was similar
(RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97, 6 studies), with moderate and
significant statistical heterogeneity (Chi2 = 15.75, df = 5; P =
0.008; I2 = 68%). See Table 1.

18
Vitamin A supplementation for preventing morbidity and mortality in children from six months to five years of age (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Only one study reporting all-cause mortality did not use the stan-
dard dose and frequency recommended by WHO: Rahmathullah
1990 used a weekly dose for 52 weeks. We did not conduct the
planned subgroup analyses.
Location
Twelve studies took place in Asia (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.96),
six in Africa (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.98), and one in Latin
America (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.08). These were not signif-
icantly different (P = 0.83). See Table 1.
Age
Five studies reported separate effects for children aged 6 to 12
months (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.82; Analysis 1.2.1) and chil-
drenagedone tofive years(RR0.68, 95%CI0.57to0.81; Analysis
1.2.2) (Sommer 1986; Rahmathullah 1990; West 1991; Daulaire
1992; Benn 1997); the subgroups did not differ significantly (P
= 0.46). Notably, both effect estimates are larger than the overall
result from 19 trials reporting mortality.
Sex
Seven studies reported separate effects for boys (RR 0.96, 95% CI
0.89 to 1.04; Analysis 1.3.1) and girls (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to
0.97; Analysis 1.3.2), which were not significantly different (P =
0.22) (Sommer 1986; West 1991; Daulaire 1992; Herrera 1992;
Lin 2008; DEVTA trial 2013; Fisker 2014).
Child mortality
Seventeen studies from countries with high child mortality showed
a similar effect as the overall estimate (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.84 to
0.94), and two studies from countries with low child mortality
showed no combined effect for VAS (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.14 to
7.08). See Table 1.
Sensitivity analyses
Bias
Of the studies at high risk of bias due to sequence generation,
only Herrera 1992 contributed to the main mortality analysis and
reported no effect (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.37), indicating
that this study was not likely to influence the results in a positive
direction.
To test for small study bias, we repeated the analysis using a ran-
dom-effects model. The overall estimate was larger than the fixed-
effect estimate (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88, 19 studies; het-
erogeneity: Tau2 = 0.04; Chi2 = 44.00, df = 17; P < 0.001; I2
= 61%); however, CIs overlapped with estimates from the fixed-
effect model. The apparent increase in effect size suggests that het-
erogeneity might be explained by relatively small studies compared
to larger studies, as exclusion of the DEVTA trial 2013 reduced
the heterogeneity (from Chi2 = 44.00, df = 17; P < 0.001; I2 =
61% to Chi2 = 30.38, df = 16; P = 0.02; I2 = 47%). See Table 1.
Design effects in cluster trials
Known ICCs were remarkably consistent. For three studies for
which the ICC was not known, we estimated ICC = 0.002 and
adjusted SEs using this value and the average cluster size. To de-
termine if this decision had any impact on the results, we repeated
the primary analysis using a much larger and much smaller ICC
estimate. The size of the effect was slightly smaller when these trials
were treated as if they had randomised individuals (RR 0.89, 95%
CI 0.84 to 0.94, 19 studies). The effect was virtually unchanged
when we increased the ICC to 0.010 (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.84 to
0.94, 19 studies). See Table 1. These results indicate that over-
weighting these three studies in the analysis would not impact the
conclusions of this review; further inflating their SEs would in-
crease the size of the effect estimate.
Secondary outcomes
Cause-specific mortality
Diarrhoea
Nine studies reported a combined 12% reduction in mortality due
to diarrhoea (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98; 1,098,538 partici-
pants; Analysis 1.4; Rahmathullah 1990; Daulaire 1992; Herrera
1992; Ross 1993 SURVIVAL; Agarwal 1995; Venkatarao 1996;
Chowdhury 2002; DEVTA trial 2013; Fisker 2014), with no im-
portant heterogeneity (Chi2 = 10.15, df = 8; P = 0.25; I2 = 21%).
We judged the quality of this evidence to be high (see Summary of
findings for the main comparison). Results for diarrhoea mortality
reported within one year of randomisation showed similar results
(0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95; 6 studies; see Table 1).
Measles
Six studies reported a lower risk of mortality due to measles, but
the effect was not statistically significant (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to
1.11; 1,088,261 participants; Analysis 1.5; Rahmathullah 1990;
Daulaire 1992; Herrera 1992; Ross 1993 SURVIVAL; Agarwal
1995; DEVTA trial 2013). There was no important heterogeneity
(Chi2 = 0.66, df = 5; P = 0.99; I2 = 0%). We judged the quality
of this evidence as low (see Summary of findings for the main
comparison). One yearpostrandomisationresultswere similar(RR
0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.37; 4 studies; see Table 1).

 Meningitis
Three studies reported a lower risk of mortality due to meningitis,
but the effect was not statistically significant (RR 0.57, 95% CI
0.17 to 1.88; Analysis 1.6; Ross 1993 SURVIVAL; Agarwal 1995;
Chowdhury 2002). There was no important heterogeneity (Chi
2 = 0.75, df = 2; P = 0.69; I2 = 0%). Only one study reported
data within one year postrandomisation, with results that were not
significant (RR 5.79, 95% CI 0.22 to 153.24; see Table 1).
Lower respiratory tract infection
Nine studies did not show any significant difference between
the intervention and placebo group (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to
1.12; 1,098,538 participants; Analysis 1.7; Rahmathullah 1990;
Daulaire 1992; Herrera 1992; Ross 1993 SURVIVAL; Agarwal
1995; Venkatarao 1996; Chowdhury 2002; DEVTA trial 2013;
Fisker 2014). There was no important heterogeneity (Chi2 = 9.70,
df = 8; P = 0.29; I2 = 18%). We judged the quality of this evi-
dence as low (see Summary of findings for the main comparison).
A combined result for one year postrandomisation showed non-
significant results (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.10; 6 studies; see
Table 1).
Cause-specific morbidity
Diarrhoea
Meta-analyses
Fifteen studies reported a 15% decrease in diarrhoea incidence
(RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.87; 77,946 participants; Analysis
1.8; Figure 4; Florentino 1990; Herrera 1992; Cheng 1993;

(counted as one study); Fisker 2014), though statistical hetero-
geneity was substantial and highly significant (Chi2 = 219.04, df
= 14; P < 0.001; I 2= 94%). We judged this evidence to be of low
quality (see Summary of findings for the main comparison).

Two studies were responsible for most of the heterogeneity and
account for the majority of the overall effect (Cheng 1993;
Chowdhury 2002). Exclusion of these studies reduced I2 from
94% to 61%, and the overall effect almost disappeared (RR 0.96,
95% CI 0.93 to 1.00; see Table 1). The observed heterogeneity
may be due to measurement error or differences in the effects of
VAS across populations and settings. For example, VAS may re-

 duce susceptibility to particular infections that are prevalent in
some places but not others.
Thirteen studies that reported data for within one year postran-
domisation showed a small effect (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.96).
See Table 1.
Three studies reported no protective effect on diarrhoea prevalence
(RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.10; Analysis 1.9; Stansfield 1993;
Long 2006a and Long 2006b (counted as one study); DEVTA
trial 2013), though statistical heterogeneity was substantial and
highly significant (Chi2 = 28.91, df = 3; P < 0.001; I2 = 90%).
Sensitivity analysis
To test for small study bias, we repeated the analysis using a ran-
dom-effects model. The overall estimate was identical to the fixed-
effect estimate, though the CI widened compared to the fixed-ef-
fect model, suggesting that heterogeneity is not explained by small
studies reporting larger effects (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98; 15
studies). See Table 1. The funnel plot we produced was dominated
by two studies accounting for 74% of the overall effect (Figure 5),
and the plot was relatively flat.

With regard to the design effects in cluster trials, no ICCs were
imputed, so a sensitivity analysis was not required.
Measles
Six studies reported a 50% decrease in measles incidence (RR 0.50,
95% CI 0.37 to 0.67; 19,566 participants; Analysis 1.10; Figure
6; Herrera 1992; Barreto 1994; Semba 1995; Benn 1997; Bahl
1999; Chowdhury 2002), with no important heterogeneity (Chi
2 = 0.55, df = 5; P = 0.99; I2 = 0%). We judged this evidence
to be of moderate quality (see Summary of findings for the main
comparison).

A combined effect from studies that reported measles incidence
within one year postrandomisation showed similar results (RR
0.54, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.80; 5 studies). See Table 1.
There were no studies that reported data on prevalence of measles.
Malaria
One study reported a 27% reduction in malaria incidence at fol-
low-up (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88; see the illustrative forest
plot in Analysis 1.11 and Table 1; Shankar 1999).
Two studies reported data on malaria prevalence; the combined ef-
fectwasnotstatisticallysignificant (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.28;
Analysis 1.12; Ross 1993 HEALTH; Ross 1993 SURVIVAL), and
there was no important heterogeneity (Chi2 = 0.02, df = 1; P =
0.88; I2 = 0%).
Meningitis
There were no studies that reported incidence or prevalence data
for this outcome.
Lower respiratory tract infection
Eleven studies reported no combined effect for VAS on LRTI
incidence (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 27,540 participants;
Analysis 1.13; Rahmathullah 1990; Cheng 1993; Barreto 1994;

2013b (considered as one study); Fisker 2014), with no important
heterogeneity (Chi2 = 11.35, df = 9; P = 0.25; I2 = 21%). We
judged the quality of this evidence to be low (see Summary of
findings for the main comparison).
Eleven studies that reported data on LRTI incidence within one
year postrandomisation showed similar results (RR 0.96, 95% CI
0.89 to 1.04). See Table 1.
Two trials with two relevant comparisons reported LRTI preva-
lence; the combined result suggests benefit for VAS (RR 0.60, 95%
CI 0.45 to 0.81; Analysis 1.14; Long 2006a; DEVTA trial 2013).
Bitot’s spots
Herrera 1992 reported no effect on Bitot’s spots incidence (RR
0.93, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.14). See Table 1
Five trials reported a 58% reduction in Bitot’s spots prevalence
(RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.53; 1,063,278 participants; Analysis
1.15; Sinha 1976; Sommer 1986; West 1991; Pant 1996; DEVTA
trial 2013), with substantial and significant heterogeneity (Chi2
= 7.89, df = 4; P = 0.10; I2 = 49%). We judged this evidence
to be of moderate quality (see Summary of findings for the main
comparison).
Three studies reported data within one year postrandomisation,
and combined results were similar (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.33 to
0.56). See Table 1.
Night blindness
Herrera 1992 reported a 47% reduction in night blindness inci-
dence (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.99), as shown in the illustrative
forest plot in Analysis 1.16.
Sommer 1986 and West 1991 reported a 68% reduction in night
blindness prevalence (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.50; 22,972
participants; Analysis 1.17), with no heterogeneity (Chi2 = 0.19,
df = 1; P = 0.66; I2 = 0%). We judged the quality of this evidence to
be moderate (see Summary of findings for the main comparison).
One study reported prevalence within one year postrandomisa-
tion, and results were similar (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.52).
See Table 1.
Xerophthalmia
Three trials reported no combined effect on xerophthalmia inci-
dence (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.03; Analysis 1.18; West 1991;
Herrera 1992; Barreto 1994), though statistical heterogeneity was
substantial and significant (Chi2 = 2.69, df = 1; P = 0.10; I2 =
63%).

 Two studies reported data for one year postrandomisation, and
results were similar (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.07). See Table 1.
Sommer 1986 and West 1991 reported a 69% reduction in xe-

0.64; I2 = 0%).
Hospitalisation
Ross 1993 HEALTH reported the likelihood of hospitalisations;
however, results were not statistically significant (RR 0.64, 95%
CI 0.40 to 1.02; see the illustrative forest plot in Analysis 1.20).
Cheng1993 reportedinconclusive evidence onhospitalisation due
to diarrhoea (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.01 to 6.11; see the illustrative
forest plot in Analysis 1.21) and hospitalisation due to LRTI (RR
0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.06; see the illustrative forest plot in
Analysis 1.22).
Side effects
We assessed two short-term side effects: vomiting (within 48
hours) and bulging fontanelle.
Four trials reported a significant increase in risk of vomiting (RR
1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.69; 10,541 participants; Analysis 1.23;
Sinha 1976; Florentino 1990; Arya 2000; Fisker 2014), with sig-
nificant statistical heterogeneity (Chi2 = 9.51, df = 3; P = 0.02; I
2 = 68%). We judged this evidence to be of moderate quality (see
Summary of findings for the main comparison).
Four trials reported bulging fontanelle side effects, but the only
two that had enough data to enable analysis reported no effect
(RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.08; Analysis 1.24; Stabell 1995; Bahl
1999; Arya 2000; Fisker 2014). Most studies included children
over one year of age and would not have assessed this side effect.
Vitamin A deficiency status
Meta-analyses
We assessed two indices of vitamin A deficiency: number deficient
and serum retinol level.
Four trials reported a 29% reduction in the number of VAD chil-
dren (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78; 2262 participants; Analysis
1.25; Ross 1993 HEALTH; Dibley 1996; Shankar 1999; Ranjini
2001); however, statistical heterogeneity was substantial and sig-
nificant (Chi2 = 13.58, df = 3; P = 0.004; I2 = 78%). We judged
this evidence to be of moderate quality (see Summary of findings
for the main comparison).
Fourteen trials reported data on vitamin A serum retinol level at
follow-up, including one factorial study contributing two com-
parisons (Pinnock 1986; Reddy 1986a and Reddy 1986b (con-
sidered as one study); Pinnock 1988; Semba 1991; Cheng 1993;
Ross 1993 HEALTH; Ross 1993 SURVIVAL; Kartasasmita 1995;
Dibley 1996; Sempertegui1999; Shankar 1999; Ranjini 2001; Lin
2009; DEVTA trial 2013). Vitamin A serum levels were higher in
the vitamin A group (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.26,
95% CI 0.22 to 0.30; Analysis 1.26); however, statistical hetero-
geneity was substantial and significant (Chi2 = 278.45, df = 14; P
< 0.001; I2 = 95%).
Eleven studies reported data within one year postrandomisation
and results showed a relatively modest effect (RR 0.45, 95% CI
0.37 to 0.53). See Table 1.
Sensitivity analysis
No studies in this outcome were at high risk of bias for sequence
generation.
To test for small study bias, we repeated the analysis using a ran-
dom-effects model. The overall estimate was considerably larger
than the fixed-effect estimate, suggesting small studies report larger
effects (SMD 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.70; 14 studies). See Table
1.
The funnel plot that we produced was highly asymmetrical (data
not shown).
With regard to the design effects in cluster trials, no ICCs were
imputed, so a sensitivity analysis was not required.

Summary of main results
Despite the addition of newer studies, notably the large study from
India (DEVTA trial 2013), vitamin A supplementation was still
associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality of 12%. There
was some statistical heterogeneity in the pooled data, and a sen-
sitivity analysis using a random-effects model changed the effect
size from 12% to 24%; however, the confidence intervals over-
lapped with that of the fixed-effect model. Whatever method of
analysis we used, vitamin A has a significant and clinically mean-
ingful effect, so supplementation should be offered to children in
populations at risk of VAD.
Even though the exact mechanism of vitamin A against mortal-
ity is not clear, at least some of its protective effect stems from
reductions in death due to diarrhoea and measles. The overall ef-
fect for mortality due to measles was not significant, as not all
the studies that reported all-cause mortality reported measles-spe-
cific mortality; however, the therapeutic effects of VAS in reducing
measles-related mortality and morbidity are well established (Yang
2005). Furthermore, VAS resulted in reduced incidence of diar-
rhoea and measles. Other reviews have shown that the therapeutic
use of VAD may prevent acute diarrhoea from becoming chronic
(Imdad 2010b). Together, these results suggest that reductions in
diarrhoea and measles are potential pathways in the reduction of
all-cause mortality.

 In addition to reducing death and illness, VAS reduces night blind-
ness and potential precursors to blindness, namely Bitot’s spots
and xerophthalmia.
Few studies reported data about side effects, including vomiting,
bulging fontanelle, and diarrhoea soon after receiving the inter-
vention. VAS may increase short-term vomiting almost two-fold.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
This review systematically assessed both mortality and morbidity
associated with VAS. This update includes new published studies,
but results are similar in terms of the effectiveness of VAS for
reducing mortality, morbidity, and nutrition-related blindness.
All included studies reporting all-cause mortality took place in
low-middle income countries. Given that a large proportion of
the included studies (20/47) specifically excluded children with
vitamin A deficiency, and vitamin A status was not clear in 23, it
is likely that the effectiveness of vitamin A supplementation may
be even more effective for children in developing countries who
are at risk of vitamin A deficiency. The primary analysis is based
on 19 trials from different countries and locations. It included
1,202,382 children randomised in this review. The risk of selec-
tive reporting for the primary outcome appears minimal. Statis-
tical heterogeneity suggests that the magnitude of the effect may
differ across settings and populations, possibly due to the extent
of VAD or the availability of other nutrients. For example, dietary
intake of vitamin A will differ across locations, and the effects of
supplementation may be smaller in places with greater access to
foods rich in vitamin A. Concomitant nutrient deficiencies may
also impair the bioavailability of the supplements, since some of
these nutrients (including fat, protein, and zinc) could be limiting
factors for the absorption and utilisation of vitamin A, which is
lipid-soluble (Villamor 2000). Comorbid illnesses could also re-
duce absorption of vitamin A; that is, if vitamin A reduces mortal-
ity by reducing susceptibility to particular pathogens, differences
in the prevalence of disease, sanitation, etc. might contribute to
heterogeneity in outcomes across trials.
Analyses for many of the cause-specific mortality and morbid-
ity outcomes were consistent in favour of intervention. A general
weakness of many interventions is the under-reporting of imple-
mentation data, such as the core components of an intervention,
the degree to which they are delivered in practice, and what aspects
of the trial may have influenced implementation (Mayo-Wilson
2007). In theory, the putative effect of this intervention relies lit-
tle on the relationship between the provider and participant, but
it is essential that large-scale interventions effectively distribute
capsules that have been stored properly and remain active. Addi-
tionally, the degree to which children were treated for morbidities
across trials might influence incidence and prevalence data col-
lected in various trials, and this could contribute to heterogeneity.
This review suggests some ways in which vitamin A might work,
but it does not describe how the effects of vitamin A might differ
across subpopulations. The included trials did not report the data
required for such analyses, and we decided a priori not to include
subgroupanalysesbasedonindividual-level moderatorsforreasons
described in the section on Subgroup analysis and investigation
of heterogeneity. A more detailed investigation of heterogeneity
would require individual participant data and possibly informa-
tion on vitamin A status at the individual or population level. Co-
interventions, including other nutrients or vaccinations, might
interact with vitamin A, but we were unable to review possible
interaction effects. We were also unable to compare HIV-posi-
tive children to HIV-negative children, though there is a separate
Cochrane Review that specifically looked at effectiveness of vita-
min A supplementation in individuals who are infected with HIV,
and the results were similar (Irlam 2010). Subgroup analyses by ge-
ographic region included few studies; some disaggregated data by
sex and age, but these were not representative of the studies overall
or the results. Subgroup results were neither significant nor mean-
ingful, and they are vulnerable to reporting bias (i.e. differences
are more likely to be reported than similarities). Though a review
with individual participant data could be informative, systematic
reviews are not the best method for answering all questions, and
other studies might explain why results are sometimes different. In
any case, the observed effects are so large that heterogeneity may
be unimportant; vitamin A should be given to children whether
it reduces childhood mortality by 7% or 17%.
Quality of the evidence
This review included 47 studies and an estimated 1,223,856 chil-
dren. This is the largest review of VAS for children to date.
In certain studies it was impossible to assess allocation conceal-
ment. Efforts to blind participants and providers suggest the over-
all risk of bias is minimal, and any impact on the primary outcome
(all-cause mortality) is likely to be small.
In some trials, children interacted with researchers or clinicians
who were aware of their assignment. We judged three studies to
be at high risk of performance bias, mostly because of failure to
adequately blind participants, providers, and outcome assessors
(Daulaire 1992; Lin 2009; DEVTA trial 2013). We considered
bias due to inadequate blinding to be low and, if anything, likely
to underestimate effects; for example, a teacher would be more
likely to give extra food to a child receiving the placebo rather than
the reverse.
Missing data are much more likely to influence secondary anal-
yses than the primary outcome. Results for all-cause mortality
are known for over 98% of randomised participants. Of the 19
(40%) studies that reported this outcome, we judged seven to
be at unclear risk of bias, but four of these had minimal at-
trition (Vijayaraghavan 1990; Ross 1993 HEALTH; Ross 1993
SURVIVAL; Venkatarao 1996). The others failed to report rea-

 sons for dropout. Two studies did not adequately handle missing
data (Pant 1996; Chowdhury 2002), but together these studies
contributed only 5% to the pooled estimate.
The DEVTA trial 2013, which included about a million children,
found a small benefit for vitamin A supplementation. These find-
ings generated controversy because many experts believe that the
methods for the delivery of the intervention and the assessment of
the primary outcome (i.e. all-cause mortality) were not rigorous
(Habicht 2013; Mannar 2013; Mayo-Wilson 2013; Sloan 2013;
Sommer 2013). For example, investigators did not count children
at baseline or obtain informed consent, and methods of follow-
up and data collection were not vigorous (Mannar 2013; Sommer
2013). In this cluster-randomised trial, vitamin A capsules were
distributedbyAnganwadiworkerswhohadcontactwith only26%
of the children living in the study area (Sommer 2013). In reply to
this extensive criticism, authors of DEVTA emphasised that results
of this trial need to be interpreted alongside previously published
studies (Peto 2013). In the updated analysis of 19 trials for all-
cause mortality for this review, DEVTA accounted for 61.7% of
the combined effect in a fixed-effect analysis. A sensitivity analysis
using a random-effects model found a 24% reduction in mortality,
essentially the same as our original estimate (RR 0.76, 95% CI
0.69 to 0.83), published previously (Imdad 2010a). Thus, VAS
appears to have a robust effect on risk of death in children, which
is clinically meaningful and important for policy. Unsurprisingly,
the effect of vitamin A supplementation may be reduced when the
intervention is not delivered with fidelity.
In summary, the primary outcome was at low risk of bias, and
the size and the significance of the effect cannot be explained by
bias. While there was some evidence of small study bias for sec-
ondary outcomes, further research is unlikely to change the con-
clusion that VAS, delivered with high quality and coverage, pre-
vents death among children aged 6 to 59 months in low- and mid-
dle-income countries. Despite sensitivity analyses and attempts to
explain sources of heterogeneity by comparing the characteristics
of the studies, we could not explain reasons for these differences
across trials. Observational studies might investigate the mecha-
nisms by which vitamin A reduces mortality.
Potential biases in the review process
This review used clearly specified inclusion and exclusion criteria,
a comprehensive search strategy for the identification of relevant
studies, and prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses to ex-
plore heterogeneity. We also described the post hoc decision to
include two quasi-RCTs (Herrera 1992; Stansfield 1993). Only
Herrera 1992 contributed data to the primary outcome of all-cause
mortality, and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that exclusion of
this study did not change the results significantly.
We combined risk ratios (events per child) and rate ratios (events
per child-year) for incidence data. Strictly speaking these two ratios
have different interpretations; however, we think that the included
studies used the same scale, and outcomes are less likely to be
biased by use of denominator. For the primary outcome of all-
cause mortality, there were three studies where the denominator
was time at risk (Ross 1993 HEALTH; Dibley 1996; Fisker 2014),
and exclusion of these studies did not change the results.
For three trials with multiple arms, we included each such study as
two comparisons (Reddy 1986a and Reddy 1986b; Long 2006a
and Long 2006b; Chen2013a and Chen 2013b). We acknowledge
thatresultsforcomparisonsfromthe same studymaybe correlated;
however, this is unlikely to affect the results of our analysis because
each group was counted only once (i.e. we would have obtained
the same overall result by combining the eligible treatment groups
and the eligible control groups).
The comprehensive search strategy was devised to minimise publi-
cation bias by searching for both published and unpublished stud-
ies, though none of the included studies were unpublished. While
studies with positive results are more likely to be published than
studies with negative results, studies large enough to make a dif-
ference in this review are very likely to be published. One study
awaiting assessment was too small to affect any analysis (Aklamati
2006).
Some secondary outcomes did not contain a majority of the chil-
dren randomised in the review, and these results may be vulnerable
to selective outcome reporting bias.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Our results are consistent with the results of other reviews assessing
a similar question, though the magnitude of the reduction in risk
of death was smaller. Glasziou 1993 reported a 30% reduction in
all-cause mortality, and Beaton 1993 reported a 23% reduction.
Fawzi 1993 used an odds ratio (OR) rather than risk ratio as the
measure of association, so the reported reduction is not directly
comparable (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.87).

Implications for practice
National and regional programmes of vitamin A supplementation
(VAS) are in place in over 70 countries worldwide and may be
among the most cost-effective public health interventions (Fawzi
2006). Over the years, the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency
(VAD) has decreased; however, it is still widely prevalent in South-
east Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (Stevens 2015). With the addi-
tion of latest evidence, this review shows that VAS may still be the
best strategy to prevent disease and death in children aged 6 to 59
months. However, we acknowledge that synthetic VAS may not be
25

 the long-term solution to control VAD. Fortification, food distri-
bution programmes, and horticultural developments may provide
more permanent relief. For example, vitamin A could be added
to rice or growers may aim to increase access to agricultural prod-
ucts such as orange-fleshed sweet potato (Klemm 2010; Klemm
2016). Furthermore, if vitamin A reduces mortality by preventing
measles, widespread vaccination will reduce the relative contribu-
tion of VAS. Until such long-term solutions are in place, supple-
mentation should continue. As access to vitamin A increases, it
will be important to continue to identify at-risk groups and deliver
supplements to them (Bhutta 2015).
The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends
VAS to children between 6 and 59 months of age, in a dose of
100,000 IU for children aged 6 to 12 months and a dose of
200,000 IU for children aged one to five years, every six months.
Based on updated results, we suggest continuing this policy for
children under five years of age in areas at risk of VAD. However,
the global policy for universal VAS must be revisited for popu-
lations where VAD no longer remains a public health issue and
VAD-associated deaths have markedly declined (Stevens 2015).
Implications for research
The effectiveness of VAS for preventing mortality is well estab-
lished. The primary results in this review are robust and clinically
meaningful. Further placebo-controlled studies would be unethi-
cal.
Nevertheless, this review does not answer a number of important
questions. There was little variation in dosing among studies re-
porting the primary outcome. One trial used weekly doses and
estimated a 54% reduction in all-cause mortality (Rahmathullah
1990). It would be ethical to conduct trials in which participants
receive different doses of vitamin A that are likely to be beneficial,
some of which could lead to larger benefits than those observed so
far, and might lead to fewer side effects (for example, vomiting).
Reductions in mortality are likely related to reduced incidence and
severity of diarrhoea and measles. The effects of VAS on relevant
pathogens and disease pathways are not well understood, and these
could be examined in observational studies or in trials of other
interventions for these problems.
Growth and other developmental outcomes are less important
than mortality, and few studies have looked into these questions.
These outcomes could be added to future versions of this review.
Observational studies might elucidate the relationship (if any) be-
tween vitamin A and growth.
Despite the primary effect, observed increases in vitamin A serum
levels were small. That said, serum level may be a poor indicator
of status and may not be related to more meaningful outcomes
like mortality or blindness (WHO 2009). On the other hand, oral
synthetic VAS supplementation may not be the best pathway for
delivery. For example, absorption may be better in protein carriers
compared to carbohydrate carriers. Further studies might com-
pare synthetic supplementation to fortification or other delivery
mechanisms.
Two additional Cochrane Reviews cover the preventive aspect of
vitamin A supplementation for infants less than six months of
age: one investigated the effects of vitamin A during the neonatal
period (Haider 2017), while another focused on infants aged one
to six months (Imdad 2016). Further reviews might investigate
different delivery channels, including food supplementation and
improved access to food or social programmes to increase uptake
of vitamin A rich foods. Several studies have investigated VAS for
pregnant and lactating mothers; these and other efforts to promote
delivery of vitamin A (for example, by increased rates and duration
of breastfeeding) may require further attention.

Agarwal 1995
Methods
Cluster-randomised trial conducted in Uttar Pradesh, India
Participants
Eligibility: all children below 6 years of age were eligible for inclusion in the trial.
Children with xerophthalmia were excluded
Sample: a total of 16 clusters (subcentres) were randomly selected and divided into 4
subdivisions (4 subcentres in each), with drugs A (vitamin A) and B (placebo) distributed
in 2 each randomly. At the end of the study, investigators found that vitamin A was
distributed in 3 subdivisions (12 subcentres) and placebo in 1 only (4 subcentres) by
mistake. A total of 17,778 children were approached but only 15,247 children were
included in the final analysis based on the fact that they received at least 1 dose of vitamin
A
Interventions
Children in the experimental group received vitamin A along with small amounts of
vitamin E. The dosages were 50,000 IU of vitamin A and 10 IU of vitamin E for children
aged 1-6 months and 100,000 IU of vitamin A and 20 IU of vitamin E for children
aged 7-72 months. The intervention was delivered every 4 months and continued for
12 months
Outcomes
All-cause and cause-specific mortality due to diarrhoea, pneumonia, measles, and menin-
gitis
Notes
The trial was conducted in 2 phases. The first phase consisted of 15 months (i.e. 3
months for registration and 12 months for intervention and measurement of relevant
outcomes). In the second phase, mortality was measured in a sub-sample of initially-
included children, exactly 12 months after termination of first phase. The cause of death
was assigned by using a verbal autopsy tool. Baseline mortality rates for children below 6
years of age were 27.7 and 23.3 per 1000 for intervention and control group, respectively,
with significant differences in the 2 groups (P < 0.01). According to WHO, India is a
country with a high child mortality rate (i.e. > 40/1000)

Methods
Factorial design, individually-randomized trial conducted in Dhaka, the capital city of
Bangladesh
Participants
Eligibility: children aged 2-5 years of either sex, vitamin A deficiency (serum retinol
level < 20 mg/dL; and nutritional status corresponding to a weight-for-age score that
was 61% of the median National Center for Health Standards standard were included.
Children who had received vitamin A supplementation during the preceding 6 months
or who had a history of night blindness or sickness due to underlying illnesses such as
diarrhoea or respiratory tract infections were excluded
Sample: 256 children
Interventions
4 groups:
1. Group I: vitamin A. Children were given 5 mL (200,000 IU) of vitamin A syrup
once a week before administration of the first dose of the vaccine and received 5 mL of
a placebo syrup every day for 42 days starting 3 weeks before administration of the first
dose of vaccine and ending 1 week after the second dose of vaccine
2. Group II: zinc. Children received 5 mL of zinc acetate syrup (containing 20 mg of
elemental zinc) daily and a single dose of a placebo syrup, according to the same
schedule used for the children in the A group
3. Grpup III: vitamin A + zinc. Supplementation with both vitamin A and zinc
4. Group IV: placebo
Outcomes

Methods
Individually-randomised study conducted in an urban slum of Delhi, India
Participants
Eligibility: infantsaged6-9monthswere identifiedandenrolledintothe studywhenthey
turned 9 months old. Infants who had a previous history of measles, contact with a case
of measles or measles immunisation, or had received a dose of vitamin A in the previous
4 months were excluded . Participants with serious illness requiring hospitalisation or
having clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency (i.e. xerophthalmia, Bitot’s spots, etc.) were
also excluded
Sample: 618 infants randomised either to vitamin A (N = 309) or placebo group (N =
309). 50% of the study population consisted of male infants
Interventions
Participants in the intervention group were given a single dose of 30 mg (100,000 IU)
of vitamin A in the form of retinol palmitate, and the control group received soybean
oil as placebo. Children were followed for 4 months
Outcomes
Antibody response to measles vaccine, incidence of measles during study period, and
side effects (like vomiting, drowsiness,etc.) in first 48 hours were also reported
Notes
The primary objective of the study was to determine the response to measles vaccine when
administered along with vitamin A at 9 months of age. The study found no significant
difference in antibody titres between the 2 groups at 3 months after the administration
of intervention.The baseline prevalence of clinical vitamin A deficiency in children aged
1-5 years in the study area was 3.5% and that of biochemical vitamin A deficiency was

Methods
Individually-randomised trial conducted in Serrinha, Brazil
Participants
Eligibility: children aged 6-48 months were eligible for inclusion in the trial. The exclu-
sion criteria was presence of xerophthalmia or measles infection within the previous 30
days. Children who received a high dose of vitamin A supplementation in the previous 6
months or had weight-for-age less than 60% of the statistical median were also excluded
Sample: a total of 1240 children were included, 620 in vitamin A group and 620 in
placebo. Mean age of participants was 28 months, and proportion of boys was 52%
Interventions
The experimental group received vitamin A in a dose of 100,000 IU for children younger
than 12 months and 200,000 IU for children older than 12 months. The control group
received placebo only. The intervention was delivered every 4 months for 1 year

Notes
The study area had inadequate pubic health services. A previous survey in the area showed
a biochemical deficiency (serum vitamin A concentration < 0.35 mmol/L) rate of 7.4%
in children of this age group. According to WHO criteria, vitamin A deficiency should be
considered a pubic health problem in this area. The surveillance for morbidity outcome
was done 3 times/week for 1 year, so the recall period was 48-72 hours. We took data
for incidence of measles and xerophthalmia from account of attrition in Results section.
According to WHO, Brazil does not have a high child mortality rate (i.e. < 40/1000)

Methods
Individually-randomised trial conducted in Belem and Mindra, 2 districts in Bissau, the
capital of Guinea-Bissau
Participants
Eligibility: infants aged 6-9 months were eligible for inclusion in the trial. Those with
signsof xerophthalmia,historyof previousvitamin A supplementation, historyof measles
infection before 9 months of age, or who had a positive haemagglutinin-inhibition assay
(HIA) titre at 9 months of age were excluded. All infants reported to have had measles
at 9-18 months of age were also excluded
Sample: a total of 462 infants were randomised to either intervention or control group.
The mean age of participants was 8.7 months, and proportion of boys was 51%
Interventions
There were 3 study groups:
1. Group I: included “infants aged 6 months and were randomly allocated to receive
either a dose of measles vaccine at 6 months and a dose of measles vaccine at 9 months
together with vitamin A supplement or the same dosing of measles vaccine with
placebo as the supplement”
2. Group II: consisted of “infants who were randomly allocated either poliomyelitis
vaccine at 6 months and a single dose of measles vaccine at 9 months with vitamin A
supplement or the same vaccine doings with a placebo as the supplement”
3. Group III: included “infants who were older than 7·5 months at the beginning of
the study or who were not found at home until they reached the age of 7·5 months,
were included in the study at age 9 months and received a measles vaccine plus vitamin
A or placebo supplement at that age”
Vitamin A was supplemented in a single dose of 100,000 IU dissolved in 1 mL of
vegetable oil along with 40 IU of vitamin E

The placebo was 40 IU of vitamin E dissolved in 1 mL of vegetable oil
Outcomes
Antibody response to measles vaccine, all-cause mortality, incidence of measles
Notes
The primary objective of the study was to calculate the antibody response to measles
vaccine when given with vitamin A. The results for antibody response to measles vaccine
showed no significant difference between the groups. The study concluded that simulta-
neous administration of measles vaccine and vitamin A has no negative effect on measles
immunity. Similarly, vitamin A supplementation was shown to have no significant effect
on immune response of CD4 and CD8 T-cell in children without clinical vitamin A
deficiency. Vitamin A or placebo was given only at 9 months of age in all 3 study groups.
The only difference among the groups was the frequency and type of vaccine adminis-
tered. We therefore added all the numbers for all 3 intervention and placebo groups to
report the outcomes of interest to our review. We primarily took data from trial flow

Methods
Factorial design, individually randomised trial conducted in Chengdu City, China
Participants
Eligibility: children aged 3-6 years, apparently good health, haemoglobin (Hb) con-
centration > 60 g/L, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) < 10 mg/L, parental or guardian’s
approval for participation and parental or guardian’s agreement to avoid additional use
of vitamin A and iron supplements during the investigation were eligible for inclusion.
Children with evidence of recent acute or chronic illnesses and/or Hb <60 g/L were
excluded
Sample: 387 children were included in the study
Interventions
4 groups:
1. Group I: received a 200,000 IU vitamin A capsule (as retinol) just once initially
2. Group II: received ferrous sulfate (element Fe 1-2 mg/kg) once daily for 6 months
3. Group III: received a 200,000 IU vitamin A capsule once initially and ferrous
sulfate (element Fe 1-2 mg/kg) once daily for 6 months
4. Group IV, as the placebo control group, received neither vitamin A nor ferrous
sulfate
Outcomes
Incidence of diarrhoea and LRTI
Notes
The study setting was a periurban area in Huayuan Town, Pixian County of Chengdu
City, Sichuan Province, western China, from March to September 2011. Supplementa-
tion was given in schools. The paper did not have a study flow diagram. The data from
the factorial design were included in 2 data sets. The first data set (Chen 2013a) is the
comparison between Vitamin A and placebo while the second data set (Chen 2013b) is
the comparison between vitamin A + iron vs iron only. The data for meta-analysis was
taken from table 2 and we calculated the rate ratio based on the number of events in the
intervention and control groups with the denominator as person-days at risk

Eligibility: infants aged 9-12 months were eligible for inclusion in the study. Participants
with a previous history of measles vaccination or an exanthematous illness, with moderate
or severe malnutrition, clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency, known immune deficiency
or on immunosuppressive therapy, and those who had received blood or blood products
in the previous 6 months were excluded
Sample: 395 infants were randomised to either vitamin A or placebo group. There
were 198 infants in the vitamin A group and 197 in the placebo group. Mean age of
participants was 9.8 months, and proportion of boys was 52%
Interventions
Infants in experimental group received a single dose of vitamin A in a dose of 100,000
IU. The control group received placebo only. Interventions were given out at the time
of measles vaccination
Outcomes
Antibody response to measles vaccine

Participants
Eligibility: children aged 1-59 months were eligible for inclusion in the trial
Sample: 16 clusters were randomly assigned either to vitamin A or control group. These
included 7197 children, of which 3786 children were in the vitamin A group and 3411
were in the control group. Proportion of boys was 51%
Interventions
In experimental group, vitamin A was given in doses of 200,000 IU for children aged
12-59 months; 100,000 IU for children aged 6-12 months; and 50,000 IU for children
aged < 6 months old. Vitamin A was supplemented once only and children were followed
for 5 months
Outcomes
All-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality due to diarrhoea, pneumonia, and
measles
Notes
The study site was a remote, mountainous region of northwestern Nepal with a total
population of about 80,000, with 12,000 children under 5 years of age. This area was
consideredasone of the poorestandmost medicallyunderservedareasof the country. The
infant mortality rate was 189 deaths per 1000 live births and child (1-4 years) mortality
rate was 52 per 1000 per year. Malnutrition was prevalent in the study area, and 26% of
children aged 1-4 years were suffering from substantial malnutrition. A survey of 3651
children under 5 years of age showed active xerophthalmia in 1.3% to 2% of population
and 1% to 5% among infants, which is high for this age group. Disaggregated data on
mortality was available according to different age groups. We have used data for children
aged 6-59 months according to the objectives of our review. According to WHO, Nepal
is a country with a high child mortality rate (i.e. > 40/1000)

DEVTA trial 2013
Methods
Factorial design, cluster-randomised trial conducted in Northern India
Participants
Eligibility: children aged 1-6 years were eligible for inclusion in the review
Sample: total clusters were 72, of which 36 clusters received vitamin A supplementation
while 36 acted as control. Authors claimed to include 1 million children in the trial
Interventions
Children in the experimental group received 200,000 IU of vitamin A every 6 months
for 5 years. Vitamin A was supplemented on mass treatment days by village child care
workers. Capusles were open and poured into child’s mouth. The control group did not
receive any intervention (no placebo tablets). The factorial design was as follows:
1. Group I: usual care
2. Group II: 6-monthly vitamin A
3. Group III: 6-monthly albendazole
4. Group IV: 6-monthly vitamin A plus albendazole
Outcomes
All-cause mortality; cause-specific mortality due to diarrhoea, pneumonia, measles, and
malnutrition; mean vitamin A serum levels; prevalence of Bitot’s spots, and measles and
pneumonia morbidity
Notes
This study was conducted in Uttar Pradesh, India. The study utilised the infrastructure of
the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), which maintains child care centres
called Anganwadi child care (AWC) centres across the state. The other intervention as
part of the factorial design was albendazole for deworming. The study was approved by
King George’s Medical University. Surveillance for disease outcomes was done every 6
months, and children were not selected randomly for that but chosen from AWC lists.
Deaths were recorded by 18 full-time, motorcycle village-to-village monitors

Interventions
The intervention group received 206,000 IU of vitamin A in the form of retinyl ester
plus 37 IU vitamin E for children aged > 12 months or 103,000 IU retinyl ester plus 17
IU vitamin E for children aged < 12 months of age. The control group received placebo
that contained 17 IU or 37 IU vitamin E according to the age of the participant. The
intervention was given every 4 months for 24 months. An average of 89% of the children
received a treatment (vitamin A or placebo)
Outcomes
All-cause mortality, incidence of diarrhoea and respiratory disease, mean vitamin A serum
level, proportion of vitamin A deficient, growth
Notes
Baseline demographic, clinical and nutritional characteristics of the participants were
the same, and the groups remained balanced at the start of each of the other 5 cycles.
Children were visited every other day for 6 cycles. The longest recall period allowed was
4 days. Observed child-days of ALRI of the vitamin A group and the control group were

were recruited as soon they were discharged from Kotive children’s hospital. No exclusion
criteria described
Sample: 358 children were randomly assigned to vitamin A, mebendazole, or control
group. Vitamin A group had 118 children and control group had 117
Interventions
There were 3 study groups. The first group was supplemented with vitamin A, the second
group received mebendazole for deworming and the third group was simply observed
as control. Children in the vitamin A group received retinol palmitate in a dose of 100,
000 IU for children aged < 1 year and 200,000 IU for those > 1 year. Supplementation
was repeated after 6 months and continued for 12 months
Outcomes
All-cause mortality, growth, and incidence of diarrhoea and respiratory disease morbidity

Notes
Morbidity surveillance was done every 2 weeks for the first 3 months, then every 3
months until 12 months. Data on morbidity outcomes were presented in the form of
odds ratios based on generalised estimating equation models. As we were using the data
in the form of risk ratios, and no nominators were given in this study, we could not pool
the data for diarrhoea and respiratory morbidity from this study

 Fisker 2014
Methods
Individually-randomized, double-blind trial conducted in Guinea-Bissau
Participants
Eligibility: children aged 6-23 months were included. Exclusion criteria were vitamin
A supplementation within the preceding month, and participation in another trial
Sample: 7587 children were randomised to either intervention or control group
Interventions
For those in the experimental group, vitamin A was given in an amount of 100,000 IU
for children aged 6-11 months and 200,000 IU for children aged 12-23 months. For
those in the control group, placebo was given in the same liquid amount as that in the
intervention group. Supplementation was given at the time of vaccination. The vitamin
A bottles contained vegetable oil with 200,000 IU vitamin A as retinyl palmitate and 40
IU vitamin E per mL oil; placebo bottles contained only 40 IU vitamin E per mL oil
Outcomes
All-cause mortality, sex-specific mortality, diarrhoea incidence, respiratory infection, ad-
verse events
Notes
Children who died because of accident were censored from mortality data analysis. We
used the raw data to calculate the mortality and morbidity estimates (i.e. number of
events in intervention group compared to control, with denominators as time of follow-
up)

Methods
Individually-randomised trial conducted in the municipalities of Pililla and Binangonan
in the province of Rizal, Philippines
Participants
Eligibility: children aged 1-6 years were eligible for inclusion in the study. Any child
with clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency was excluded from the trial
Sample: 2471 children were randomised to 3 intervention groups. Mean age of children
was 3.4 years, and proportion of boys in study population was 49.5%
Interventions
There were 3 study groups: 2 were supplemented with vitamin A and 1 with placebo.
The first experimental group received a high dose of vitamin A (i.e. 200,000 IU), and
the second experimental group received a medium dose of vitamin A (i.e. 100,000 IU)
. The control group received placebo only. Children were supplemented only once and
were followed for 1 week
Outcomes
Incidence of side effects within 1 week (nausea and/or vomiting, headache, diarrhoea
and fever)
Notes
The study area had a high prevalence of malnutrition, and therefore vitamin A deficiency
was likely to be prevalent. The study reported outcomes for the first 48 hours and within
a week. We have pooled the data for the first week

Methods
Cluster-randomised trial conducted in 5 rural councils in northern Sudan
Participants
Eligibility: inclusion criteria was 9-72 months of age. Children with xerophthalmia were
excluded
Sample: randomisation was done by households. The study included a total of 28,753
children, of whom 14,455 were in vitamin A group and 14,298 were in placebo group.
The proportion of boys in the study was 50.7%
Interventions
Children in the vitamin A group received 200,000 IU of retinol palmitate along with
40 IU of vitamin E. The comparison group received 40 IU of vitamin E only. The
intervention was given every 6 months for 18 months

Outcomes
All-cause mortality; cause-specific mortality due to diarrhoea, measles, respiratory dis-
ease; incidence of diarrhoea, respiratory disease, and measles; incidence of xerophthalmia,
Bitot’s spots, and night blindness
Notes
Authors used non-specific terms for describing cause of death (in table 4) like “shortness
of breath”, “convulsions”, and “fever”, etc. We have pooled data for “shortness of breath”
under the heading of mortality due to lower respiratory tract infection. This is because it
is highly unlikely that a child will die of an upper respiratory tract infection, and lower
respiratory tract infection is a more general term than pneumonia to cover this, as it
includes pneumonia as well. According to WHO, Sudan is a country with a high child
mortality rate (i.e. > 40/1000)

comparison group received Tocopherol (vitamin E) as placebo. Supplements were given
at enrolment, 4 months, and 8 months
Outcomes
Mean serum retinol levels, growth, and adverse reactions to vitamin A
Notes
The infant mortality rate in the study area was 35/1000 live births. The primary objective
of the study was to measure the effect of vitamin A on barrier function of gastrointestinal
tract. The study concluded that the prevalence of new parasitic infection, especially with
Giardia species, was significantly decreased with vitamin A intervention, suggesting an
immune regulatory modulation of this nutrient on parasitic intestinal infections

Methods
Factorial design, individually randomised trial conducted in La Magdalena Atlicpac,
Mexico
Participants
Eligibility: children aged 6-15 months were eligible for inclusion in the review. Children
who were suffering from diseases causing immunosuppression and any congenital or
acquired alteration of the digestive tract that could alter the absorption of micronutrients
were excluded. Children who were taking vitamin supplements were also excluded from
the study
Sample: 786 children were randomised to 4 intervention groups. Mean age of partici-
pants was 9.8 months; proportion of boys in study population was 51.7%
Interventions
The 4 intervention groups were as follows:
1. Group I: vitamin A group that received 20,000 IU retinol every 2 months for
children aged < 1 year or 45,000 IU for children aged > 1 year
2. Group II: Zn group that received a daily dose equivalent to 20 mg elemental Zn
as zinc methionine
3. Group III: zinc supplement plus vitamin A as above
4. Group IV: placebo
Interventions were delivered every 2 months for 12 months
Outcomes
Diarrhoea and respiratory disease morbidity
Notes
We have included data of this factorial design trial in 2 sets. The first data set gives
comparisons for vitamin A vs placebo, and the second set includes data for vitamin
A + zinc vs zinc only. Data on respiratory morbidity was given with three definitions.
We have pooled the data for “cough + difficulty breathing” under the heading of lower
respiratory tract infection

Participants
Eligibility: children aged 5-15 months were eligible for inclusion in the trial. Those
who were immunosuppressed, had any congenital abnormality or chronic diarrhoea were

Methods
Cluster-randomised trial conducted in Trichy district of Tamil Nadu in southern India
Participants
Eligibility: children aged 6-60 months were included in the study.
Sample: clustering unit was ’panchyat’ (local government areas). 206 clusters were
formed, and the majority of them consisted of 50-100 children. The included clusters
had a total of 15,419 children, of whom 7764 were in vitamin A group and 7655 in
placebo group
Interventions
Children in experimental group received weekly doses of 8333 IU vitamin A and 20
mg vitamin E. The control group received 20 IU of vitamin E only in peanut oil. Any
children diagnosed with xerophthalmia at baseline, midterm, or final examination were
given a high dose (200,000 IU) supplement of vitamin A and continued in the study.
Supplementations were given for 52 weeks. Children who missed 7 consecutive dosages
were excluded from the analysis
Outcomes
All-cause mortality; cause-specific mortality due to diarrhoea, measles, and respiratory
disease; incidence of diarrhoea and respiratory disease morbidity

month history of diarrhoea and respiratory disease, anthropometric indexes of nutritional
status, xerophthalmia status, 5-year retrospective history of mortality of children under
5, household economic, household hygienic status, and serum retinol levels. On average
> 90% of the children were contacted each week, and the lowest coverage in any single
week was 88%. 11% had clinical evidence of xerophthalmia, while about 38% had serum

Randomised, double-blind controlled trial conducted in Guinea savannah area of Ghana
Participants
Eligibility: children aged 6-59 months were included. Those with active xerophthalmia
or measles were excluded from the trial the moment they were confirmed
Sample: 1455 children were included. The proportion of male children was 49.5%
Interventions
Children in vitamin A group received either 200,000 IU retinol equivalent for partic-
ipants aged > 12 months or 100,000 IU for children aged 6-12 months. The control
group received placebo. Interventions were given every 4 months for 12 months
Outcomes
All-cause mortality; mean daily prevalence of respiratory tract disease, diarrhoea, measles,
malaria; mean vitamin A serum levels; all-cause hospitalisations
Notes
The study populations were rural and their main staple foods are deficient in carotenoids
and vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency and xerophthalmia were recognised as problems
locally. Children were visited weekly for 1 year. Children in the Health Study were
followed up 596 child-years for vitamin A group and 589 for control group. According
to WHO, Ghana is a country with a high child mortality rate (i.e. > 40/1000)

Individually randomised trial conducted in Indonesia
Participants
Eligibility: children aged 3-6 years were eligible for inclusion in the study. Those who
had median weight for age < 80% of the National Center for Health Statistics were
excluded from the study. Children with serious illness were also excluded from the study
and treated appropriately
Sample: 236 children were randomised to 4 intervention groups. Mean age of partici-
pants was 58.9 months, and proportion of boys was 71.6%
Interventions
There were 4 intervention groups. 2 groups (vitamin A and placebo) had clinical signs
of vitamin A deficiency, while 2 groups were clinically normal
Participants in vitamin A groups received a single dose of 60 000 microgram of retinol
equivalent. Children were followed for 1 month

Eligibility: children aged 6-36 months were eligible for inclusion in the review. Those
children who had clinical vitamin A deficiency, who did not reliably stay at home or
at day care centres during weekdays or who had been given multivitamins in the last 3
months, were excluded
Sample: 400 children were randomised either to vitamin A or placebo group with equal
(200 each) in both the groups. Mean age of participants was 21.1 months, and half the
participants were boys
Interventions
Children in the supplement-treated group received a weekly dose of 10,000 IU of vitamin
A for 40 weeks, and children in the non-supplement group received a weekly placebo
for the same period
Outcomes
Incidence of diarrhoea and respiratory disease morbidity, mean vitamin A serum levels

a significant difference between 2 study groups with respect to age. Study area had a high
prevalence of malnutrition and xerophthalmia in the study population. Children were
visited every 2 weeks for 12 months. The respiratory disease morbidity was reported with
respect to cold, cough, and rapid breathing, which were too non-specific for inclusion
under umbrella of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection morbidity in our review

Methods
Cluster-randomised study in rural Nepal
Participants
Eligibility: children aged between 0 and 5 years were eligible for the study. Children
with xerophthalmia were included. Children who had recently participated in a vitamin
A programme were excluded from the study
Sample: 28,630 children in 261 clusters were recruited. 51.3% of participants were boys
Interventions
Vitamin A (100,000 IU for 6-11 months and 200,000 IU for children 12 months and
older) administered 1-3 times was compared with a very low dose of vitamin A (1000
IU). Both supplements contained 40 IU vitamin E
Study duration: 16 months
Outcomes
Mortality, cause-specific mortality, Bitot’s spots, night blindness, xerophthalmia
Notes
ICC not disclosed, although study estimates reported to have been adjusted for the unit
of allocation
Study had additional recruitment phases in second and third treatment cycles. 1807 and

Comment: the rates of withdrawal were bal-
anced between the treatment groups and
the data were analysed based on patient
years of observation. The unclear reasons
for withdrawals, variable duration of follow-
up due to more than recruitment cycle and
the low rate of mortality in relation to the

Aamer Imdad (AI) and Evan Mayo-Wilson (EMW) contributed to the Background section. EMW and AI were primarily responsible for
the Methods section, and AI conducted the literature search. AI and EMW reviewed citations for inclusion and resolved disagreements
through consultation. AI and EMW extracted data. AI entered outcome data into RevMan (RevMan 2014), analysed the data, and
wrote-up the results. AI made the ’Characteristics of included studies’ and ’Risk of bias’ tables. AI, EMW and Zulfiqar Ahmed Bhutta
(ZAB) contributed to writing the discussion. ZAB provided supervision and contributed to the writing and analyses.
ZAB has overall responsibility for the review.

 Electronic searches
1. The Global Health database, which we searched in the previous version of this review (Imdad 2010a), was no longer available to
us.
2. The metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) was under review and not available at the time of searching, so we searched
ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) instead.
3. We searched four additional databases for this update.
i) Science Citation Index.
ii) Conference Proceedings Citation Index -Science.
iii) Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.
iv) Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE).
See Electronic searches section.
Selection of studies
For this update, Aamer Imdad and Zunirah Ahmed independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion in the review, as Kurt
Herzer was not available to help.
Data extraction and management
For this update, Aamer Imdad and Jai Das or Renee Sharma independently extracted data from each eligible study. In the previous
version of this review (Imdad 2010a), two people independently extracted data from each eligible study using Distiller software. A team
at the Cochrane Editorial Unit (Toby Lasserson, Rachel Murphy, and Karla Soares-Weiser) also extracted data, but there was always at
least one extractor who was an author (Aamer Imdad, Kurt Herzer, Evan Mayo Wilson, and Mohammad Yawar Yakoob).
Assessment of risk of bias
For this update, Aamer Imdad and Jai Das or Renee Sharma independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. In the
previous version of this review (Imdad 2010a), one of the primary review authors (Aamer Imdad, Kurt Herzer, Evan Mayo Wilson or
Mohammad Yawar Yakoob) assessed risk of bias in collaboration with staff members from the Cochrane Editorial Unit (Toby Lasserson,
Rachel Murphy, and Karla Soares-Weiser).
Assessment of heterogeneity
When reporting the results of the random-effects model, where possible, we reported Tau2 - an estimate of between-study variance.
Data synthesis
We made a post hoc decision to pool incidence and prevalence data separately for certain morbidly outcomes.

 Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We did not perform a subgroup analysis based on baseline HIV status, as none of the included studies gave a baseline status of study
population on HIV, and we excluded studies conducted on children with HIV.
Sensitivity analyses
1. We only performed sensitivity analyses for three outcomes: all-cause mortality, diarrhoea incidence, and vitamin A serum levels.
2. We made a post hoc decision to perform sensitivity analyses on imputed ICCs to test the robustness of the results.
Change in author
A previous author of this review (Dr Mohammad Yawar Yakoob) was not available to help with this update, and thus we removed his
name from the author line. We greatly acknowledge Dr. Yawar’s contribution to the first version of this review.
