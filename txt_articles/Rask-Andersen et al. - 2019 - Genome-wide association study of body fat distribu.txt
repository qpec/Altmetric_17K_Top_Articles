Body mass and body fat composition are of clinical interest due to their links to cardiovascular-
and metabolic diseases. Fat stored in the trunk has been suggested to be more pathogenic
compared to fat stored in other compartments. In this study, we perform genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) for the proportion of body fat distributed to the arms, legs and
trunk estimated from segmental bio-electrical impedance analysis (sBIA) for 362,499 indi-
viduals from the UK Biobank. 98 independent associations with body fat distribution are
identified, 29 that have not previously been associated with anthropometric traits. A high
degree of sex-heterogeneity is observed and the effects of 37 associated variants are stronger
in females compared to males. Our findings also implicate that body fat distribution in females
involves mesenchyme derived tissues and cell types, female endocrine tissues as well as
extracellular matrix maintenance and remodeling.

verweight (body mass index [BMI] > 25) and obesity
(BMI > 30) have reached epidemic proportions globally1.
Almost 40% of the world’s population are now over-
weight2 and 10.8% are obese3. Obesity is set to become the
world’s leading preventable risk factor for disease and early death
due to the increased risks of developing type 2 diabetes, cardio-
vascular disease, and cancer4. The distribution of adipose tissue to
discrete compartments within the human body is associated with
differential risk for development of cardiovascular and metabolic
disease5. Body fat distribution is also well known to differ
between sexes. After puberty, women accumulate fat in the trunk
and limbs to a proportionally greater extent compared to other
parts of the body, while men accumulate a greater extent of fat in
the trunk6. Accumulation of adipose tissue around the viscera, the
internal organs of the body, is associated with increased risk of
disease in both men and women7. In contrast, the preferential
accumulation of adipose tissue in the lower extremities, i.e., the
hips and legs, has been suggested as a factor contributing to the
lower incidence of myocardial infarction and coronary death
observed in women during middle age8. The differential dis-
tribution of body fat between sexes has been attributed to
downstream effects of sex hormone secretion5. However, the
biological mechanisms that underlie body fat distribution have
not been fully elucidated.
BMI is commonly used as a proxy measurement of body
adiposity in epidemiological studies and in clinical practice.
However, BMI is unable to discriminate between adipose and lean
mass, and between fat stored in different compartments of the
body. Other proxies that better represent distribution of body fat
have also been utilized, such as waist circumference (WC), hip
circumference (HC), and the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Through
genome-wide association studies (GWAS), researchers have
identified hundreds of loci to be associated with proximal mea-
surements of body mass and body fat distribution such as BMI9,
WHR10,11 and hip and waist circumference11. Sex-stratified
analyses have revealed sexual dimorphic effects at twenty WHR-
associated loci and 19 of these loci displayed stronger effects in
women12. Body fat mass has also been studied in GWAS by using
bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) and dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA)13,14. BIA measures the electrical impe-
dance through the human body, which can be used to calculate an
estimate of the total amount of adipose tissue. The gold standard
method for measurements of body fat distribution is computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). How-
ever, these methods are costly. A GWAS has been performed for
subcutaneous and visceral adiposity, measured with computed
tomography scans, albeit in a relatively limited number of indi-
viduals (N = 10,577)15.
Developments in BIA technology has now allowed for cost-
efficient segmental body composition scans that estimate of the
fat content of the trunk, arms and legs16 (Fig. 1a). In this study,
we use segmental BIA (sBIA) data on 362,499 participants of the
UK Biobank to study the genetic determinants of body fat dis-
tribution to the trunk, arms, and legs. For this purpose, we

study, adipose tissue mass was estimated using the Tanita BC-418MA body composition analyzer (a). This machine uses an eight-electrode method, which
allows for five measurements of impedance. Electrical current is supplied to the front of both feet and the fingertips of both hands. Voltage is measured on
either heel or thenar portion of the palms. Body composition is derived from a regression formula for each body part. The formula is derived from
regression analysis using height, weight, age and impedance for each body part as predictors for composition of each body part as assessed by DXA (b).

 perform GWAS on the proportion of body fat distributed to these
compartments. We also perform sex-stratified analyses to identify
effects that differ between males and females.
We find 98 independent genetic signals to be associated with
body fat distribution, as determined by sBIA, of which 29 have
not previously been associated with any adiposity-related phe-
notype. We also find that genetic associations strongly differ
between the sexes, in particular for distribution of adipose tissue
to the legs and trunk where effects are primarily observed in
females.

Results
Genome-wide association studies for body fat ratios. The
proportions of body fat distributed to the arms—arm fat ratio
(AFR), the legs—leg fat ratio (LFR), and the trunk—trunk fat
ratio (TFR) were calculated by dividing the fat mass per com-
partment with the total body fat mass for each participant
(Fig. 1a). We conducted a two-stage GWAS using data from the
interim release of genotype data in UK Biobank as a discovery
cohort. Another set of participants, for which genotype data were
made available as part of the second release, was used for repli-
cation. After removing non-Caucasians, genetic outliers and
related individuals, 116,138 and 246,360 participants remained in
the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively. Basic char-
acteristics of the discovery and replication cohorts are presented
in supplementary Table 1. Females were found to have higher
total sBIA-estimated fat mass compared to men in both the
discovery and replication cohort. Males had higher average pro-
portion of body fat located in the trunk compared to females
(62.2% vs. 50.3%) and females had a larger proportion of body fat
located in the legs (39.7% vs. 28.1%). While the total amount of
adipose tissue in the arms was estimated to be higher in females
compared to males, the fraction of adipose tissue distributed to
the arms were similar. Several smaller differences between the
discovery and replication cohorts were present (supplementary
Table 1), such as some slight differences in height and age
between men and women in the discovery and replication
cohorts. These differences most likely represent the 50,000 par-
ticipants for the UK Biobank Lung Exome Variant Evaluation
(UK BiLEVE) project that were included in the first release of
genotyping data for ~150,000 participants, which were used as a
discovery cohort in this study. Selection for UK BiLEVE was
conducted with specific consideration to lung function which may
reflect the differences in baseline characteristics for this subset of
the cohort. These participants were also genotyped on a separate
but similar microarray and a batch variable was included in our
association analyses to adjust for any effects related to the dif-
ferent genotyping arrays as well as having participated in the UK
BiLEVE study (see methods).
GWAS was performed for each of the three phenotypes (AFR,
LFR, and TFR) in the discovery cohort (sex-combined) and when
stratifying by sex (males and females), while adjusting for
covariates as described in the method section. A total of
25,472,837 imputed SNPs, with MAF of at least 0.0001, were
analyzed in the discovery GWAS. LD score regression inter-
cepts17 ranged from 1.00 to 1.03 (supplementary Figs. 1–4,
supplementary Table 2), and were used to adjust for genomic
inflation. We used the --clump function in PLINK18, in
combination with conditioning on the most significant SNP, to
identify associations that were independent within each GWAS as
well as between the GWAS for the three body fat ratios (AFR,
TFR, or LFR) or between strata (males, females or sex-combined;
see methods). For each independent association, the lead SNP,
i.e., the SNP that was most significant in any of the phenotypes or
strata, was taken forward for replication. In total, 135 indepen-
dent associations were taken forward for replication of which 98
replicated (supplementary Tables 3–5, Supplementary Data 1).
Substantial overlap in associated loci was observed between LFR
and TFR loci (Fig. 2a) while AFR overlapped only to a small
degree with LFR and TFR. One locus in the vicinity of
ADAMTSL3 was associated with all three phenotypes.
Overlap with findings from previous GWAS. Body fat ratio-
associated SNPs were tested for overlap with associations from
previous GWAS for anthropometric traits by determining LD
with entries from the GWAS-catalog19. In total, we identified 29
body fat ratio-associated signals that have not previously been
associated with an anthropometric trait (Figure 1c, Table 1,
supplementary Figs. 2–4). A large number of the body fat ratio-
associated signals overlapped with previously identified height-
associated loci20,21 (supplementary Data 1) and the majority of
these signals were associated with TFR and/or LFR (36 out of 40).
For AFR, the strongest associations were observed at well known
BMI
and
adiposity-associated
loci
such
as:
FTO,
MC4R,
TMEM18, SEC16B, and TFAP2B (supplementary Data 1).
We compared the direction of the effects for overlapping
GWAS results by estimating the effects of lead body fat ratio-
associated SNPs on the respective overlapping anthropometric
traits. The effects of TFR-associated SNPs were directionally
consistent with effects on height and WHR adjusted for BMI
(WHRadjBMI), while the effects were the opposite for LFR. The
direction of effects for AFR-associated SNPs were consistent with
effects on BMI, WC, and WHR (supplementary Table 6).
Among the loci that have not previously been associated with an
adiposity-related anthropometric trait, five overlapped with cardi-
ovascular and metabolic trait-associated loci from previous GWAS:
near XKR6, which is associated with carotid intima thickness22,
triglycerides23,24, and systolic blood pressure25,26; ZNF652: coronary
artery disease27 and diastolic blood pressure26,28; RP11-32D16.1:
diastolic- and systolic blood pressure26,29; RFTN: low HDL
cholesterol30; and ERI1, which is associated with systolic blood
pressure26 (supplementary Table 7).
Sex-heterogenous effects of associated variants were tested for
using the GWAMA software. This method utilizes summary
statistics from sex-stratified GWAS to test for heterogeneity of
allelic effects between males and females31. All replicated lead
SNPs were included in these analyses. SNPs were only tested for
heterogenous effects on the traits that they were associated with,
which corresponds to 30 variants that were tested for sex-
heterogenous effects on AFR, 44 on LFR and 66 on TFR. A
striking heterogeneity in effects between males and females was
observed (Table 2, supplementary Data 2). Two variants, near
SLC12A2 and PLCE1, were shown to have larger effects on AFR
in males while 37 variants exhibited larger effects in females.
These variants were primarily associated with LFR and/or TFR
(Table 2).
LD score regression (LDSC) was used to estimate the fraction
of variance of body fat ratios that could be explained by SNPs, i.e.,
the SNP heritability17. SNP heritability was higher in females
compared to males for all traits and ranged from ~21 to ~25% in
females and from 11 to 15% in males (supplementary Table 2).
Correlation between fat ratios and anthropometric traits.
Phenotypic and genotypic correlations were assessed, in males
and females separately. Phenotypic correlations were estimated by
calculating squared semi-partial correlation coefficients with
ANOVA of nested linear models that were adjusted for age and

 principal components while genetic correlations were estimated
using cross-trait LD score regression32 (see methods). Overall, the
genetic and phenotypic correlations showed a large degree of
similarity (supplementary Tables 8–9) and the correlations
between the anthropometric traits and body fat ratios were
directionally consistent for phenotypic and genetic correlations
for all phenotypes. In females, BMI and WC was strongly cor-
related with AFR both with regards to phenotypic and genetic
correlations (Fig. 2c, supplementary Tables 8–9). Height con-
tributed to a moderate degree in explaining the phenotypic var-
iance
in
LFR
and
TFR
in
females
(16.0%
and
25.3%,
supplementary Table 8) despite the rather strong genotypic cor-
relation between height and both LFR and TFR (Fig. 2c, sup-
plementary Table 9). In males, anthropometric traits contributed
only to a small degree in explaining the phenotypic variance of
body fat ratios (supplementary Table 8). Consistent with this
result, genetic correlations between body fat ratios and anthro-
pometric traits in males were also quite low (Fig. 2c, supple-
mentary Table 9).
Strong genotypic and phenotypic correlations were seen
between LFR and TFR in both males and females with more
than 82% of the variance explained (Fig. 2b, supplementary
Tables 8–9). LFR and TFR were inversely correlated, which agrees
well with the large overlap in GWAS results for these phenotypes
and the fact that the effect estimates from the GWAS was in the
opposite direction for LFR and TFR (supplementary Data 1). In
contrast, AFR appeared to be more independent, as only a low
amount of phenotypic and genetic correlation was observed
between AFR and LFR/TFR (Fig. 2b, supplementary Tables 8–9).
Functional annotation of associated loci. Functional annotation
of the GWAS loci was performed by identifying overlap with
eQTLs from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project33
(supplementary Data 3) and by identifying potentially deleterious
missense variants in LD (R2 > 0.8) with our lead SNPs (supple-
mentary Table 10). In total, 31 body fat ratio-associated loci
overlapped with an eQTL, and 11 lead SNPs were in LD with a
potentially deleterious missense variant. Polyphen and SIFT-
scores were used to assess the deleteriousness of the variants.

variants

been shown to be associated with progression of cancer36,37 and
to affect insulin secretion in vitro38.
Enrichment analyses. To identify the functional roles of body fat
ratio-associated variants and which tissues are mediating the
genetic effects, we performed enrichment analyses with DEPICT
(Data-driven Expression Prioritized Integration for Complex
Traits39, see method section). In these analyses we used summary
statistics from sex-stratified GWAS on the combined cohort
(195,043 women and 167,408 men) in order to maximize statis-
tical power. Results from the enrichment analyses were compared
with results from previous GWAS for height, BMI9 and
WHRadjBMI12. Substantial overlap of enriched gene sets was
observed between LFR/TFR with height and WHRadjBMI. In
contrast, BMI-associated biological processes overlapped only to a
marginal extent: 2% of all gene sets that were enriched for BMI-
associated genes were also enriched for LFR- and TFR-associated
genes (Fig. 3a).
Tissue enrichment was observed for LFR and TFR-associated
genes in females (Fig. 3b, c) in gene sets related to female
reproductive
tissues,
musculoskeletal
tissues,
chondrocytes,
mesenchymal stem cells, and fibroblasts. For TFR, DEPICT also
revealed enrichment of genes associated with adipose tissue cells,
female urogenital organs, endocrine organs as well as the arteries
(Fig. 3b). Tissue enrichment was not seen for the other traits or
strata.
In the gene set analyses, enrichment was only detected for
TFR- and LFR-associated genes in females as well as LFR-
associated genes in males (supplementary Data 4). Gene sets
related to bone morphology and skeletal development were
among the most strongly associated with both LFR and TFR. We
also find the TGFβ signaling pathway gene set to be enriched for
genes within the TFR and LFR-associated loci in females, as well
as SMAD1-, SMAD2-, SMAD3- and SMAD7 protein-protein
interaction subnetworks (supplementary Data 4), which act as
TGFβ downstream mediators. There was a substantial overlap of
enriched gene sets between TFR and LFR in females as well as
moderate overlap with LFR-associated gene sets in males
(supplementary Fig. 5). The large fraction of overlapping gene
sets between LFR and TFR in females agrees well with the large
overlap in GWAS signals.
Discussion
In this study, we performed GWAS on distribution of body fat to
different compartments of the human body and identified and
replicated 98 independent associations of which 29 have not
previously been associated with any adiposity-related phenotype.
In contrast to earlier studies, we have not addressed the total
amount of fat but rather the fraction of the total body fat mass
that is located in the arms, legs and trunk. Body fat distribution is
well known to differ between males and females, which we also
clearly show in our study. We also show that the genetic effects
that influence fat distribution are stronger in females compared to
males. These results are consistent with previous GWAS that have
revealed sexual dimorphisms in genetic loci for adiposity-related
phenotypes, such as waist circumference and waist-to-hip
ratio10,40,41. Phenotypic and genetic correlations, as well as
results from GWAS and subsequent enrichment analyses, also
revealed that the amount of fat stored in the arms in females is
highly correlated with BMI and WC. This suggests that the
proportion of fat stored in the arms will generally increase with
increased accumulation of body mass and adipose tissue. In
contrast, males exhibited moderate-to-weak phenotypic and
genetic correlations between the distributions of fat to different
parts of the body and anthropometric traits, which indicates that
the proportions of body fat mass in different compartments of the
male body remains more stable as body mass and body adiposity
increases. Among the three phenotypes analyzed in this study
LFR and TFR were inversely correlated in both males and

 females. This suggests that LFR and TFR to a large extent describe
one trait, i.e., the distribution of adipose tissue between these two
compartments, which is further supported by the large overlap in
GWAS loci between the two phenotypes. In contrast, AFR was
only weakly correlated with the other two traits.
Tissue enrichment revealed an important role in body fat
distribution in females for mesenchyme-derived tissues: i.e., adi-
pose and musculoskeletal tissues; as well as tissues related to
female reproduction. This suggests that the distribution of fat to
the legs and trunk in females is mainly driven by the effects of
female gonadal hormones on mesenchymal progenitors of mus-
culoskeletal and adipose tissues. Enrichment analyses also showed
that LFR and TFR have unique features that separates them from
other anthropometric measurements, which was indicated by the
portion of LFR/TFR-associated gene sets that did not overlap with
height-, BMI-, or WHRadjBMI-associated gene sets. However,
there was also an overlap in the functional aspects between these
traits with both height and WHRadjBMI. This is indicated by the
tissue enrichment profile for LFR/TFR-associated genes, which
shares features with tissue enrichments reported for height in
previous GWAS20 where height-associated genes were strongly
enriched in musculoskeletal tissue types with additional enrich-
ment in cardiovascular and endocrine tissue types, while.
WHRadjBMI-associated genes12 were enriched in adipocytes and
adipose tissue subtypes. Of particular note, we did not identify
any enrichment of body fat ratio-associated genes in CNS tissue
gene sets in contrasts to enrichment analyses in previous GWAS
for BMI where the CNS has been implicated in playing prominent
role in obesity susceptibility9.
In the GWAS for LFR and TFR in females, we find that several
genes that highlight the influence of biological processes related
to the interaction between cells and the extracellular matrix
(ECM), as well as ECM-maintenance and remodeling. These
include ADAMTS2, ADAMTS3, ADAMTS10, ADAMTS14, and
ADAMTS17, which encode extracellular proteases that are involved
in enzymatic remodeling of the ECM. Two lead SNPs were in LD
(R2 > 0.8) with potentially damaging missense mutations in
ADAMTS10 and ADAMTS17 and two other GWAS signals over-
lapped with eQTLs for ADAMTS14 and ADAMTS3. In addition,
possibly deleterious missense mutations in LD with our lead GWAS

 SNPs were also found for VCAN and ACAN. Both VCAN and
ACAN encode chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan core proteins that
constitute structural components of the extracellular matrix, parti-
cularly in soft tissues42. These proteins also serve as major sub-
strates for ADAMTS proteinases43. ECM forms the three-
dimensional support structure for connective and soft tissue. In
fat tissue, the ECM regulates adipocyte expansion and prolifera-
tion44. Remodeling of the ECM is required to allow for adipose
tissue growth and this is achieved through enzymatic processing of
extracellular molecules such as proteoglycans, collagen and hya-
luronic acid. For example, the ADAMTS2-, 3-, and 14-proteins act
as procollagen N-propeptidases that mediate the maturation of
triple helical collagen fibrils45,46. We therefore propose that the
effects of genetic variation in biological systems involved in ECM-
remodeling is a factor underlying normal variation in female body
fat distribution.
In summary, GWAS of body fat distribution determined by
sBIA reveals a genetic architecture that influences distribution of
adipose tissue to the arms, legs, and trunk. Genetic associations
and effects clearly differ between sexes, in particular for dis-
tribution of adipose tissue to the legs and trunk. The distribution
of body fat in women has previously been suggested as a causal
factor leading to lower risk of cardiovascular and metabolic dis-
ease, as well as cardiovascular mortality for women in middle age5
and genetic studies have identified SNPs that are associated with a
favorable body fat distribution47, i.e., with higher BMI but lower
risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The capacity for
peripheral adipose storage has been highlighted as one of the
components
underlying
this
phenomenon47.
Resolving
the
genetic determinants and mechanisms that lead to a favorable
distribution of body fat may help in risk assessment and in
identifying novel venues for intervention to prevent or treat
obesity-related disease.
Methods
UK Biobank participants. The first release of imputed genotype data from UK
Biobank (N = 152,249) was used as a discovery cohort, and an unrelated set of
participants from the second release (N = 326,565) as a replication cohort. Imputed
genotype data from the third UK Biobank genoype data release were used for
replication. Participants who self-reported as being of British descent (data field
21000) and were classified as Caucasian by principal component analysis (data field
22006) were included in the analysis. Genetic relatedness pairing was provided by
the UK Biobank (Data field 22011). Participants were removed due to relatedness
based on kinship data (estimated genetic relationship > 0.044), poor genotyping call
rate (<95%), high heterozygosity (Data field 22010), or sex-errors (Data field
22001). After filtering, 116,138 participants remained in the discovery cohort and
246,361 in the replication cohort.
Ethics. Ethical approval to collect participant data was given by the North West
Multicentre Research Ethics Committee, the National Information Governance
Board for Health & Social Care, and the Community Health Index Advisory
Group. UK Biobank possesses a generic Research Tissue Bank approval granted by
the National Research Ethics Service (http://www.hra.nhs.uk/), which lets appli-
cants conduct research on UK Biobank data without obtaining separate ethical
approvals. All participants provided signed consent to participate in UK Biobank48.
Genotyping, imputations, and QC. Genotyping in the discovery cohort had been
performed on two custom-designed microarrays: referred to as UK BiLEVE and
Axiom arrays, which genotyped 807,411 and 820,967 SNPs, respectively. Imputa-
tion had been performed using UK10K49 and 1000 genomes phase 350 as reference
panels. Prior to analysis, we filtered SNPs based on call rate (--geno 0.05), HWE
(P > 10−20 (Fischer’s exact test), MAF (--maf 0.0001), and imputation quality (Info
> 0.3) resulting in 25,472,837 SNPs in the discovery cohort. The third release of
data from the UK Biobank contained genotyped and imputed data for 488,366
participants (partly overlapping with the first release). For our replication analyses,
we included an independent subset that did not overlap with the discovery cohort.
Genotyping in this subset was performed exclusively on the UK Biobank Axiom
Array. This dataset included 47,512,111 SNPs that were filtered based on HWE
(P < 10−20, Fischer’s exact test), call rate > 95% (--geno 0.05), Info > 0.3, and MAF
> 0.0001. All genomic positions are in reference to hg19/build 37.
Phenotypic measurements. The phenotypes used in this study derive from
impedance measurements produced by the Tanita BC-418MA body composition
analyzer. Participants were barefoot, wearing light indoor clothing, and measure-
ments were taken with participants in the standing position. Height and weight
were entered manually into the analyzer before measurement. The Tanita BC-
418MA uses eight electrodes: two for each foot and two for each hand. This allows
for five impedance measurements: whole body, right leg, left leg, right arm, and left
arm (Fig. 1a). Body fat for the whole body and individual body parts had been
calculated using a regression formula, that was derived from reference measure-
ments of body composition by DXA (Fig. 1b) in Japanese and Western subjects.
This formula uses weight, age, height, and impedance measurements51 as input
data. Arm, and leg fat masses were averaged over both limbs. Arm, leg, and trunk
fat masses were then divided by the total body fat mass to obtain the ratios of fat
mass for the arms, legs and trunk, i.e., what proportion of the total fat in the body is
distributed to each of these compartments. These variables were analyzed in this
study and were named: AFR, LFR, and TFR.

 Correlations between fat ratios and anthropometric traits. Phenotypic corre-
lations between fat distribution ratios and anthropometric traits were estimated by
calculating squared semi-partial correlation coefficients for males and females
separately, using anova.glm in R. Adipose tissue ratios (AFR, LFR or TFR) were set
as the response variable. BMI, waist circumference, waist circumference adjusted
for BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, height, or one of the other ratios were included as the
last term in a linear model with age and principal components as covariates. The
reduction in residual deviance, i.e., the reductions in the residual sum of squares as
BMI, waist circumference, waist circumference adjusted for BMI, waist-to-hip
ratio, height, or one of the other ratios was added to the model, is presented as
percentages of the total deviance of the null model in supplementary Table 8.
Genome-wide association studies for body fat ratios. A two-stage GWAS was
performed using a discovery and a replication cohort. Sex-stratified GWAS were
performed in the discovery cohort for each trait. A flowchart that describes the
steps taken for the genetic analyses is included as supplementary Fig. 6. Prior to
running the GWAS, body fat ratios were adjusted for age, age squared and nor-
malized by rank-transformation separately in males and females using the
rntransform function included in the GenABEL library52. GWAS was performed in
PLINK v1.90b3n18 using linear regression models with the age-adjusted and rank-
transformed AFR, LFR, and TFR as the response variables and the SNPs as
explanatory variables. 50,000 participants of UK Biobank were genotyped on a
separate array as part of the UK BiLEVE project. A batch variable was used as
covariate in the GWAS for the discovery analyses to adjust for genotyping array
(UKB Axiom and UK BiLEVE) as well as for other differences between UK BiLEVE
and UKB Axiom-genotyped participants. We also included the first 15 principal
components and sex (in the sex-combined analyses) as covariates in the GWAS.
LD score regression intercepts (see further information below), calculated using
ldsc17, were used to adjust for genomic inflation, by dividing the square of the t-
statistic for each tested SNP with the LD-score regression intercept for that GWAS,
and then calculating new P-values based on the adjusted t-statistic. We used a
threshold of P < 10−7, after adjusting for LD score intercept, as a threshold for
significance in the discovery cohort.
The --clump function in PLINK was used to identify the number of
independent signals in each GWAS. This function groups associated SNPs based
on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern. The parameters for clumps were set to:
--clump-p1 1*10−7, --clump-p2 1*10−7, --clump-r2 0.10, and --clump-kb 1000.
This function groups SNPs within one million base pairs that were associated with
the trait at P < 1*10−7. After running --clump in PLINK, conditional analyses were
also performed for each locus conditioning for the lead SNP, but no further signals
were identified. Several associations were found in more than one of the three body
fat ratios (AFR, TFR, or LFR) or strata (males, females, or sex-combined) and
different lead SNPs were observed for different traits and strata at several loci. To
assess whether these represented the same signal, we assessed the LD between
overlapping lead SNPs in PLINK. SNPs in low LD (R2-value < 0.05) were
considered to represent independent signals. We then performed conditional
analysis in PLINK, conditioning on the most significant SNPs across all phenotypes
and strata. Lead SNPs with a P < 1*10−7 after conditioning on other potentially
linked R2-value ≥ 0.05 lead SNPs, were considered as being independent signals.
For each independent signal, the lead SNP (lowest P-value) was taken forward for
replication. Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing during
replication and p-values < 0.05/135 were considered to be statistically significant.
Meta analyses of results from the discovery and replication cohorts was performed
with the METAL software53 for all independent associations that were taken
forward for replication.
SNP heritability and genetic correlations. We estimated SNP heritability and
genetic correlations using LD score regression (LDSC), implemented in the ldsc
software package17. Only SNPs that were included in HapMap3 were included in
these analyses. LDSC uses LD patterns and summary stats from GWAS as input.
For genetic correlations, we performed additional sex-stratified GWAS in the UK
biobank (using the same covariates as for the ratios) for standard anthropometric
traits, BMI, height, WC, WHR, WCadjBMI, and WHRadjBMI, in the discovery
cohort. GWAS summary stats were filtered for SNPs included in HapMap3 to
reduce likelihood of bias induced by poor imputation quality. After this filtering,
1,164,192 SNPs remained for LDSC analyses. LD scores from the European data of
the 1000 Genomes project (including LD patterns for all the HapMap3 SNPs) for
use with LDSC were downloaded from the Broad institute at: https://data.
broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/eur_w_ld_chr.tar.bz2. Genetic correla-
tions between the three body fat ratios and anthropometric traits were assessed by
cross-trait LD score regression.
Overlap with findings from previous GWAS. Lead SNPs from all independent
signals in our analyses were cross-referenced with the NHGRI-EBI catalog of
published genome-wide association studies (GWAS Catalog—data downloaded on
23 April 2018)19 to determine whether body fat ratio-associated signals overlapped
with previously identified anthropometric associations from previous GWAS. We
used a cut-off of R2 < 0.1 between SNPs from our analyses and anthropometric
trait-associated SNPs (P < 5*10−8) from GWAS catalog to determine any overlap
with findings from previous GWAS. LD between data in the GWAS catalog and
our lead SNPs were calculated using PLINK v1.90b3n18. In addition, lead SNPs at
Body fat ratio-associated loci that potentially overlapped (R2 > 0.1) with signals
from previous GWAS were tested for association with standard anthropometric
traits (BMI, height, WC, WHR, WCadjBMI, and WHRadjBMI) in the UK biobank
discovery cohort using PLINK v1.90b3n18 through linear regression modeling and
including sex, age a batch variable and 15 principal components as covariates.
Here, a P < 1e−7 was considered significant.
Functional annotation of associated loci. Associated loci were investigated for
overlap with eQTLs from the GTEx project33. The threshold for significance for the
eQTLs was set to 2.3*10−9 in agreement with previous studies54. The strongest
associated SNP for each tissue and gene in the GTEx dataset was identified. We
then estimated the LD between the top eQTL SNPs and the lead SNP for each
independent association from our analysis. If a SNPs from our analyses were in LD
(R2 > 0.8) with a lead eQTL SNP the two signals were considered overlapping.
Lead SNPs, and all SNPs in LD (R2 > 0.8) with a lead SNP from our analyses
(LD determined in the UK biobank cohort in PLINK) were cross-referenced with
dbSNP (human 9606 b150) in order to identify potentially deleterious intragenic
variants in LD (R2 > 0.8) with the body fat ratio-associated variants. Polyphen and
SIFT-scores for the missense variants (extracted from Ensembl—www.ensembl.
org) were used to assess the deleteriousness of the body fat ratio-associated
variants.
Enrichment analysis. To identify the functional roles and tissue specificity of
associated variants, we performed tissue and gene-set enrichment analyses using
DEPICT39. For the gene-set enrichment in DEPICT, gene expression data from
77,840 samples have been used to predict gene function for all genes in the genome
based on similarities in gene expression. In comparison to standard enrichment
tools that apply a binary definition to define membership in a set of genes that have
been associated with a biological pathway or functional category (genes are either
included or not included), in DEPICT, the probability of a gene being a member of
a gene set has instead been estimated based on correlation in gene expression. This
membership probability to each gene set has been estimated for all genes in the
human genome and the membership probabilities for each gene have been
designated reconstituted gene sets. A total of 14,461 reconstituted gene sets have
been generated which represent a wide set of biological annotations (Gene
Ontology [GO], KEGG, REACTOME, Mammalian Phenotype [MP], etc.). For
tissue enrichment in DEPICT, microarray data from 37,427 human tissues have
been used to identify genes with high expression in different cells and tissues.
For the enrichment analyses, we performed sex-stratified GWAS for AFR, LFR
and TFR on the combined cohort, i.e., the discovery and replication cohorts,
including 195,043 females and 167,408 males, in order to achieve higher power.
The clump functionality in PLINK is used to determine associated loci. The P-value
cut-off for association for clump was set at P < 10−7. In the enrichment analyses,
DEPICT assesses whether the reconstituted gene sets are enriched for genes within
trait-associated loci39. The false discovery rate (FDR)55 was used to adjust for
multiple testing. Twelve analyses were run in total (tissue enrichment and gene-set
enrichment) and FDR < 0.05/12 was considered significant.
Interaction between SNPs and sex. We used the GWAMA software31 to test for
heterogenous effects of associated SNPs between sexes. In GWAMA, fixed-effect
estimates of sex-specific and sex-combined beta coefficients and standard errors are
calculated from GWAS summary statistics to test for heterogeneous allelic effects
between females and males. GWAMA obtains a test-statistic by subtracting the sex-
combined squared t-statistic from the sum of the two sex-specific squared t-sta-
tistics. This test statistic is asymptotically χ2-distributed and equivalent to a normal
z-test of the difference in allelic effects between sexes. Lead SNPs that replicated
were tested for heterogeneity between sexes for the trait that they were associated
with. This corresponds to 30 tests for AFR, 44 for LFR, and 66 for TFR. Bonferroni
correction was used to correct for multiple testing and P-values < 0.05/140 =
3.57*10−4 (χ2 test) were considered to be significant. Summary statistics from the
replication cohort were used in order to maximize statistical power.
