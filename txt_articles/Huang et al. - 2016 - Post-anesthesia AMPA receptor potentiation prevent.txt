Post-anesthesia AMPA receptor potentiation prevents
anesthesia-induced learning and synaptic deficits
Lianyan Huang,1 Joseph Cichon,2 Ipe Ninan,3 Guang Yang1*
Accumulating evidence has shown that repeated exposure to general anesthesia during critical stages of brain
development results in long-lasting behavioral deficits later in life. To date, there has been no effective treatment to
mitigate the neurotoxic effects of anesthesia on brain development. By performing calcium imaging in the mouse
motor cortex, we show that ketamine anesthesia causes a marked and prolonged reduction in neuronal activity dur-
ing the period of post-anesthesia recovery. Administration of the AMPAkine drug CX546 [1-(1,4-benzodioxan-6-
ylcarbonyl)piperidine] to potentiate AMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor
activity during emergence from anesthesia in mice enhances neuronal activity and prevents long-term motor
learning deficits induced by repeated neonatal anesthesia. In addition, we show that CX546 administration also
ameliorates various synaptic deficits induced by anesthesia, including reductions in synaptic expression of
NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and AMPA receptor subunits, motor training–evoked neuronal activity, and den-
dritic spine remodeling associated with motor learning. Together, our results indicate that pharmacologically
enhancing neuronal activity during the post-anesthesia recovery period could effectively reduce the adverse
effects of early-life anesthesia.
INTRODUCTION
General anesthetics are commonly used to modulate the activity of
neuronal networks, producing a reversible loss of sensation and con-
sciousness in surgeries (1–3). Although the vast majority of patients
restore their physiological homeostasis soon after anesthesia, some may
suffer from long-term adverse effects of anesthesia. A higher incidence
of learning disabilities and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders
has been found in children repeatedly exposed to procedures requiring
general anesthesia (4–8). Animal studies further demonstrated that
prolonged exposure to anesthetics and sedatives during critical stages
of brain development causes neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits
in both rodents and nonhuman primates (9–13). So far, there has been
no effective strategy to alleviate the neurotoxic effects of anesthetic drugs.
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic, which depresses neuronal ac-
tivity and reduces calcium influx into neurons, in part through blockade
of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)–type glutamate receptors (2). Recent
in vivo imaging studies have shown that multiple exposures to general
anesthesia induced by ketamine-xylazine (KX) during early postnatal
development impair motor learning and learning-dependent remodel-
ing of postsynaptic dendritic spines in adolescent mice (14). Given the
important roles of neuronal activity in shaping the development of
neuronal circuits (15, 16), an intriguing possibility is that pharmaco-
logically enhancing neuronal activity after anesthesia could be benefi-
cial in alleviating the adverse effects of neonatal exposure to
anesthesia.
Here, we examined the effects of an AMPAkine drug, 1-(1,4-
benzodioxan-6-ylcarbonyl)piperidine (CX546), on KX anesthesia–
induced learning and synaptic deficits. AMPAkines are a class of compounds
that increase a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
(AMPA) receptor transmission. These compounds bind to a modula-
tory site on the AMPA receptor to reduce the kinetics of channel de-
activation and desensitization, and they have been documented to
enhance learning and memory in rodents and possibly humans
(17–19). Using in vivo two-photon imaging, we show that KX causes
a substantial and prolonged reduction in neuronal Ca2+ activity that
persists into the period of post-anesthesia recovery. We found that
administration of CX546 after anesthesia in mice restores neuronal
Ca2+ activity and prevents neonatal anesthesia–induced motor learning
deficits in adulthood. Furthermore, CX546 rescues KX anesthesia–
induced synaptic deficits, including decreased expression of synaptic
protein and impaired synaptic functional and structural plasticity as-
sociated with learning. Together, our results indicate that pharmaco-
logically enhancing neuronal activity by the AMPAkine CX546 during
the post-anesthesia recovery period effectively reduces learning and
synaptic deficits caused by early exposure to anesthesia.
RESULTS
CX546 enhances neuronal activity during the
post-anesthesia period
To determine the effect of neonatal KX anesthesia on neuronal activ-
ity, we performed in vivo calcium imaging of layer V (L5) pyramidal
neurons in the motor cortex of 2-week-old mice with or without
anesthesia (Fig. 1A). We used transgenic mice expressing the genet-
ically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP specifically in L5 pyrami-
dal neurons to monitor neuronal activity (Fig. 1B) (20, 21). We
found that the level of somatic Ca2+ transients was greatly reduced
after an intraperitoneal injection of KX [ketamine (20 mg/kg) and
xylazine (3 mg/kg)] when compared to that under awake conditions
(Fig. 1, B and C; total integrated DF/F0: 7.9 ± 0.7% versus 32.7 ±
1.6%, P < 0.0001). MK801, an antagonist of the NMDA receptor,
mimicked the effect of KX on somatic Ca2+ transients (Fig. 1C), sug-
gesting that the reduction in neuronal activity during KX anesthesia

 is mainly mediated by NMDA receptor blockade. Although mice
started to wake up and exhibited voluntary movements within 1 hour
after KX injection as indicated by EMG recording (Fig. 1D), the level
of somatic Ca2+ transients remained significantly lower as compared
to the awake state (DFKX–1 h/DFawake: 0.52 ± 0.04; P < 0.0001; Fig. 1, D
and E). The reduction in somatic Ca2+ transients persisted for at least
2 hours after the injection of KX (DFKX–2 h/DFawake: 0.71 ± 0.05; P =
0.0072). Thus, KX anesthesia causes a reduction in neuronal activity
that persists into the post-anesthesia recovery period.
Previous studies have shown that AMPAkines are allosteric mod-
ulators that directly potentiate AMPA receptor–mediated synaptic
transmission (17). To test whether AMPAkine treatment is effective
in restoring neuronal activity in post-anesthesia mice, we treated mice
with CX546 1 hour after KX injection (Fig. 1D). We found that a
single injection of CX546 caused a dose-dependent increase in neuronal
activity (Fig. 1E). Neuronal activity was significantly increased within
15 min after CX546 injection (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally; P <
0.0001). Thirty minutes after CX546 injection (90 min after KX
injection), the level of somatic Ca2+ transients in cortical pyramidal
neurons was comparable to that during the pre-KX awake state
(normalized change in Ca2+, 1.14 ± 0.12), indicating that CX546
was effective in restoring neuronal activity during post-anesthesia re-
covery. In addition to CX546, we found that another AMPAkine drug,
CX516, also increased neuronal activity in the period of post-anesthesia
recovery (fig. S1). At the same dosage (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), the
effect of CX516 on L5 somatic Ca2+ activity was ~68% of CX546.
Together, these results demonstrate that potentiation of AMPA receptor
activity with AMPAkines helps to restore neuronal activity in post-
anesthesia mice.
CX546 rescues motor learning deficits induced by
repeated anesthesia
Previous studies have shown that three exposures, but not a single ex-
posure to KX anesthesia, during postnatal days 14 to 18 (P14–18) im-
pair the animals’ motor learning in adolescence (14). We next
determined whether administration of AMPAkines in post-anesthesia
mice may prevent motor learning deficits induced by multiple anesthetic
exposures (Fig. 2). Because CX546 is more effective than CX516 in en-
hancing neuronal activity, we chose CX546 to test our hypothesis.
Specifically, mice received one or three injections of KX [ketamine
(20 mg/kg) and xylazine (3 mg/kg)] or saline during the second or third
postnatal week. In either adolescence (P30) or adulthood (P60), mice
were trained to run on an accelerated rotarod (Fig. 2, A and B). In this
rotarod running task, the animals learn to change their gait pattern to
maintain their balance on an accelerated rotating rod (22, 23). The
rotarod performance was measured by the average running speed that
mice mastered after training. Consistent with previous studies (14),
although a single exposure to KX anesthesia has no apparent effect
on the animals’ behavior at P30, mice subjected to multiple sessions
of anesthesia during P7–11 or P14–18 showed worse rotarod
performance after 2-day training at both 1 month (Fig. 2A) and
2 months of age (Fig. 2B). Because the rotarod performance on the first
training day was not significantly different among all the groups, this
finding indicates impaired motor skill learning after repeated anesthe-
sia exposure. This deficit in the rotarod task was not observed in
groups of mice that received an intraperitoneal injection of CX546
(20 mg/kg) 1 hour after each KX injection (Fig. 2, A and B). Admin-
istration of CX546 alone had no significant effects on the animals’
rotarod performance (P > 0.5, Tukey’s post hoc test).

 In addition to the rotarod task, we observed motor learning deficits
in another motor learning paradigm, treadmill running, where mice
learned to change their gait patterns progressively (Fig. 2, C and D).
In this treadmill running task, the animals’ gait patterns were classified
as drag, wobble, sweep, and steady run (24). Mice displayed large
proportions of untrained gait features (drag, wobble, and sweep) when
they first ran on the treadmill, whereas the percentage of trained gait
feature (steady run) increased after training. In both adolescent and
adult mice, when treadmill performance was assessed 5 hours after
an initial 1-hour training, we found significant increases in trained gait
feature in saline-treated controls (post-training versus pre-training:
P = 0.0005 and P < 0.0001, paired t test), whereas mice with repeated
KX exposure failed to show training-related performance improvement
(Fig. 2, C and D). Mice that were given CX546 after KX anesthesia
showed similar increases in treadmill performance as the control group
(Fig. 2, C and D). Together, these observations indicate that long-lasting
motor learning deficits caused by repeated KX anesthesia during early
development could be rescued by administration of CX546 during the
post-anesthesia recovery period.
CX546 treatment prevents the reduction of synaptic protein
expression after repeated anesthesia
The results above indicate that pharmacologically enhancing neuronal
activity with CX546 during post-anesthesia recovery effectively prevents
motor learning deficits induced by early exposure to anesthesia. To ex-
plore the mechanisms underlying anesthesia-induced learning deficits
and CX546-mediated protection, we examined the amounts of various
proteins in the cortex after repeated KX exposure, focusing on those
involved in synaptic activity and function. Synaptosome and whole-
cell preparations were generated from the cortex of P30 and P60
mice that had received three KX injections during P7–11, and
protein concentrations were determined by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 3A). We found that in both adolescent and adult mice, post-
synaptic glutamate NMDA receptor subunits (GluN1 and GluN2A)
and the glutamate AMPA receptor subunits (GluA1 and GluA2)
were significantly decreased in synaptosomes from KX-treated mice
as compared to saline-treated controls (P30: P = 0.0068, 0.0344,
0.0317, and 0.0400; P60: P = 0.0083, 0.05, 0.0104, and 0.0306, Tukey’s
post hoc test; Fig. 3, B to D). The amounts of GluN1, GluN2A, GluA1,
and GluA2 in the whole-brain fraction, however, remained unaltered
(Fig. 3, E to G). These results demonstrate that repeated anesthesia at
the neonatal stage causes long-lasting reduction of glutamate receptors
at synapses. Mice that received both KX and CX546 exhibited normal
synaptic expression of NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits during
adolescence and adulthood (P > 0.2 versus saline; Fig. 3, B to D), sug-
gesting that potentiating neuronal activity with CX546 during the
post-anesthesia period prevents synaptic deficits later in life.
CX546 treatment rescues training-evoked neuronal activity
after repeated anesthesia
Ionotropic glutamate receptors are responsible for the glutamate-
mediated postsynaptic excitation of neurons (Fig. 1C) (25, 26). The
rescue of anesthesia-induced reduction of NMDA and AMPA recep-
tors at synapses by CX546 suggests that deficits of neuronal function
may also be rescued. To test this, we examined the neuronal activity in
the primary motor cortex by performing in vivo Ca2+ imaging of L5
pyramidal neurons while mice performed a motor skill task. In this
experiment, mice received three KX or saline injections at P7–11.
At either P30 or P60, mice were head-restrained and trained to run
forward on a custom-built, free-floating treadmill under a two-photon
microscope (Fig. 4A) (24). L5 pyramidal neurons of the motor cortex
were imaged across three two-photon imaging planes, which span the
cortical column (Fig. 4B). Here, we were able to record Ca2+ activity in
apical tuft dendrites (10 to 50 mm from pial surface), in apical trunk
dendrites (200 to 250 mm from pial surface), and at the level of the L5
soma (500 to 600 mm from pial surface) during the quiet resting state
and forward running (Fig. 4C; total recording time, 2.5 min for resting
and 2.5 min for treadmill running). We observed a significant reduc-
tion in the number of Ca2+ transients generated in the apical tuft/
trunk dendrites and soma of L5 neurons when 1-month-old mice with
neonatal KX exposure were running on the treadmill as compared
with saline-injected controls (Fig. 4, D and E; tuft, P = 0.0016; trunk,
P = 0.0453; L5 soma, P = 0.0472, Tukey’s post hoc test). The peak
amplitudes (DF/F0) of Ca2+ transients in the apical tuft, apical trunk,
and L5 soma were not significantly different in KX-treated mice as
compared to saline-injected controls (Fig. 4F). CX546 treatment after
repeated KX at P7–11 rescued training-evoked Ca2+ transients generated
in the apical tuft, apical trunk, and L5 soma to the same level as the saline
controls (Fig. 4, D and E). CX546 treatment did not alter the peak am-
plitude of Ca2+ transients generated during running as compared to KX-
treated mice (Fig. 4F). Similar to what was observed in 1-month-old
animals, we found that at P60, the level of motor training–evoked Ca2+
activity in L5 neurons remained significantly lower in KX-treated mice
relative to saline-treated controls (tuft, P < 0.0001; trunk, P = 0.0008;
L5 soma, P < 0.0001) but not in mice with CX546 treatment (Fig. 4G).
Together, these results show that mice with repeated KX anesthesia dur-
ing early development have decreased motor training–evoked neuronal
activity and that CX546 reverses these changes in neuronal activity.
CX546 treatment partially rescues motor learning–induced
dendritic spine formation after repeated anesthesia
The formation and elimination of synaptic connections are thought to
play an important role in learning and memory formation (23, 27–32).
Our previous studies have shown that repeated exposure to KX in
mice at P14–18 results in the reduction of motor learning–dependent
dendritic spine formation (14). To examine whether CX546 rescues def-
icits in motor learning–induced spine plasticity, we first examined the
dynamics of postsynaptic dendritic spines of L5 pyramidal neurons
in the motor cortex of Thy1-YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) mice
that received a single or repeated KX exposure at P7–11 (Fig. 5A). Un-
der baseline conditions (no motor training), we found that spine for-
mation and elimination over 2 days in 1-month-old mice that received
a single or repeated KX exposure at P7–11 were comparable to those
in saline-treated controls (Fig. 5, B and C). These results indicate that
early exposure to KX does not alter the baseline dynamics of dendritic
spines in the motor cortex in adolescence.
Next, we examined whether motor learning–induced spine remod-
eling is altered after repeated KX exposure (Fig. 5D). We found sig-
nificant decreases in motor learning–induced spine formation (7.8 ±
0.4%, 742 spines, n = 5 mice; P < 0.0001, Bonferroni’s post hoc test)
and spine elimination (5.1 ± 0.2%; P = 0.0125) in 1-month-old mice
that have received three KX injections at P7–11 as compared with
saline-treated controls (formation, 13.4 ± 0.8%; elimination, 7.5 ± 0.5%;
687 spines, n = 5 mice) (Fig. 5, D to F). A single injection of KX at P7
had no effects on motor learning–induced spine remodeling. Mice with
consecutive administrations of KX and CX546 exhibited significant

676 spines, n = 5 mice; P = 0.0198) and spine elimination (7.7 ± 0.6%;
P = 0.0071) as compared to mice with KX injections only. Similar results
were observed in adult mice at 2 months of age: Motor learning–induced
spine formation was significantly lower in mice with three KX injections
at P7–11 (6.1 ± 0.6%; P < 0.0001) but not in mice with CX546 treatment
after anesthesia (8.8 ± 0.3%), as compared with saline-treated controls
(10.4 ± 0.3%) (Fig. 5G). We did not find significant differences in motor
learning–induced spine elimination among the three groups of mice at
P60 (Fig. 5H). These results show that CX546 treatment rescues motor
learning–induced dendritic spine plasticity in the motor cortex of mice
subjected to repeated neonatal anesthesia.
DISCUSSION
With an increasing number of infants and young children exposed
to anesthetic agents each year, there is a growing concern about the
safety of general anesthesia for the developing brains. Growing pre-
clinical evidence indicates that early-life anesthesia could impair the
development of neuronal circuits and cause long-lasting learning
deficits (9–13). Here, we show that KX anesthesia causes a prolonged
reduction of neuronal activity in the motor cortex. The reduction in
neuronal activity extends well into the post-anesthesia recovery period
and can be rescued rapidly after administration of an AMPAkine
drug, CX546. Adult mice with repeated KX anesthesia during the sec-
ond postnatal week display deficits in motor skill learning and
learning-induced synaptic plasticity. Administration of CX546 during
post-anesthesia recovery prevents anesthesia-induced motor learning
and synaptic impairments. Together, our studies indicate that phar-
macologically enhancing neuronal activity during the post-anesthesia
recovery period could be an important strategy for reducing adverse
effects caused by early exposure to anesthesia.
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that primarily blocks NMDA
receptors (2, 33). In rodents, ketamine is frequently used together with
the a2-adrenoreceptor agonist xylazine to decrease the ketamine dose

 for anesthesia induction. Although a single injection of ketamine
(20 mg/kg) combined with xylazine (3 mg/kg) produces a light sur-
gical level of anesthesia in young mice for less than 1 hour (14), we
found that neuronal activity in the cortex remains decreased for at
least 2 hours, suggesting a prolonged aftereffect of KX on brain activ-
ity. Blockade of NMDA receptors with MK801 produced a similar ef-
fect on neuronal Ca2+ dynamics as KX, suggesting that the effect of
KX on neuronal activity is largely caused by the blockade of NMDA
receptors. Although the KX combination is not used clinically, keta-
mine is widely used in pediatric patients for either anesthetic or sed-
ative purposes. It is possible that pediatric patients undergoing
ketamine anesthesia or sedation may suffer from reduced neuronal
activity as we observed in the mouse brain. Furthermore, other anes-
thetics used in pediatric medicine could also cause prolonged reduc-
tion in neuronal activity during emergence from anesthesia and may
impair brain development.
Given the important role of neuronal activities in neural develop-
ment, we reasoned that under the circumstance when anesthesia is not
optional, swift restoration of neuronal activity and calcium influx into
neurons during the recovery phase of general anesthesia could be an
effective strategy to reduce its adverse effects. Realizing well-documented
neurotoxic effects of some NMDA receptor agonists, we focused
our attention on compounds that potentiate AMPA receptor activity.
AMPAkines are a group of small compounds that slow the onset of
AMPA receptor desensitization and/or deactivation, thereby in-
creasing fast excitatory transmission (17). These compounds do not
have agonistic or antagonistic properties but instead modulate the re-
ceptor rate constants for transmitter binding, channel opening, and de-
sensitization. They can freely cross the blood-brain barrier (34) and
have been documented to enhance learning and memory in animal
and human studies (19). Our studies show that CX546 is effective in
restoring neuronal activity during the post-anesthesia recovery period
and preventing repetitive KX-induced
motor learning deficits.
Although it has become increasingly
clear that prolonged exposure to general
anesthesia could cause substantial
changes in the developing brain (9–12, 35),
the precise neuropathology underlying
cognitive dysfunction in adulthood is
not clear. Here, we found decreases in
a number of synaptic proteins (GluN1,
GluN2A, GluA1, and GluA2) in the cor-
tex of both adolescent and adult mice
with repeated neonatal exposure to KX
anesthesia. There were no changes in
the abundance of GluN1, GluN2A,
GluA1, and GluA2 in the whole-cell frac-
tion. The differences in glutamate re-
ceptor subunit expression between
synaptosome and whole-brain fraction
could be due to the fact that these pro-
teins are not only expressed at synaptic
sites but also present in nonsynaptic sites
of neurons, as well as in glial cells. Given
the pivotal roles of ionotropic glutamate
receptors in fast excitatory synaptic
transmission in the brain (25), reduced
expression of NMDA and AMPA recep-
tor subunits identified here can have a
major impact on the level of neuronal
network activity. Using in vivo Ca2+ im-
aging, we found that motor training–
evoked Ca2+ transients in L5 pyramidal
neurons of the motor cortex were re-
duced in mice with repeated ketamine
exposure. Together, these findings show
that repeated exposure to anesthesia
causes long-lasting changes in synapse
maturation, which in turn contributes to
motor learning deficits observed in our
study.

 motor skill learning (23, 28, 30). Previous studies have demonstrated
that rotarod training over 2 days results in a 5 to 7% increase in new
spines in the motor cortex (23, 30). A fraction of training-associated
new spines persist over weeks, and the amount of persistent new
spines strongly correlates with the animals’ performance (23, 30). Al-
though baseline spine dynamics remain unaltered in mice with re-
peated KX exposures, we observed a reduction in learning-induced
dendritic spine remodeling after 2-day training. Together with the
finding of decreased neuronal activity during training in these mice,
these results suggest that after early anesthetic exposure, cortical
circuits are less responsive to modulation by learning experience
and exhibit reduced synaptic plasticity in adulthood. The reductions
in both motor learning–induced neuronal activity and synaptic struc-
tural plasticity can be rescued by CX546 treatment, further supporting
the therapeutic potential of CX546 in ketamine anesthesia–induced
cognitive impairments.
The mechanisms by which CX546 alleviates anesthesia-induced
synaptic and learning deficits remain to be determined. The beneficial
effect of CX546 could be simply due to the shortening of the post-
anesthesia depression of cortical activity as a result of potentiation of
AMPA receptor activity by CX546. In addition to restoring cortical
activity, CX546 may cause other changes in the brain to offset the del-
eterious effects of anesthetic exposure on the developing brain. For
example, it has been shown that AMPAkine treatments increase the
expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (36–39).
BDNF is a potent regulator of synaptic plasticity (40) and therefore
could have an important role in the rescue of synaptic and behavioral
phenotypes associated with early anesthetic exposure. Future studies
are needed to determine whether brief AMPAkine treatments would
elicit the positive trophic effects associated with the neurotrophin in
the developing brain.
Our experiments with CX546 treatment are proof-of-principle stu-
dies, which support the hypothesis that pharmacologically enhancing
neuronal activity is an effective strategy for the treatment of long-lasting
effects of early exposure to anesthesia. Over the past decade, AMPA-
kines have been favored for the treatment of cognitive deficits. Several
compounds have generated very promising preclinical results in the
treatment of a number of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, Huntington’s disease, schizophrenia, and depression (19, 39, 41).
They have also been used to improve cognition in healthy and elderly
human volunteers (42). Drugs like CX546 and CX516 appear to be in-
herently safe because their ability to prolong AMPA receptor activity is
kinetically limited. In the future, it would be of great interest and impor-
tance to test whether these drugs are effective at minimizing the risk for
the development of learning disabilities in children who receive multiple
and prolonged anesthesia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of potentiating
AMPA receptor activity on mitigating learning and synaptic deficits
induced by neonatal anesthesia. Mice were randomly assigned to three
experimental groups: (i) saline-treated controls, (ii) three episodes of
anesthesia, and (iii) three episodes of anesthesia plus AMPAkine treat-
ment. For all three groups of mice, motor learning performance was
examined by rotarod and treadmill running tasks, synapse protein ex-
pression was measured by Western blot, and training-evoked neuronal
activity and synapse structural remodeling were determined by in vivo
two-photon imaging. No statistical methods were used to pre-
determine sample size. Group sample size was chosen on the basis
of previous studies using the same methodologies, and variance was
similar between groups being statistically compared. The researchers
were blind to group assignment, and no data points were excluded
from the statistical analysis.
Experimental animals
Thy1-YFP mice (H line) (43) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory
and used for dendritic spine imaging experiments. Thy1-GCaMP6slow
mice (line 1) and Thy1-GCaMP2.2c mice (21) were used for Ca2+ im-
aging experiments. Mice were group-housed in New York University
Skirball animal facility. All experiments were performed in accordance
with institutional guidelines. For early anesthesia treatment, mice were
given an intraperitoneal injection of KX mixture [ketamine (20 mg/kg)
and xylazine (3 mg/kg)] every other day (P7, P9, and P11 or P14, P16,
and P18) for a total of three injections. One injection of KX at this dose
induces anesthesia and provides immobilization in neonatal mice for
~1 hour and does not cause cell apoptosis (14). Control animals received
saline injections. For CX546 treatment, mice received an intraperitoneal
injection of CX546 (20 mg/kg) 1 hour after each KX injection. During
anesthesia, a heating pad was used to maintain the animal’s body tem-
perature at about 37°C.
In vivo Ca2+ imaging
In vivo Ca2+ imaging was performed in awake, head-restrained mice.
The surgical procedure for preparing awake animal imaging has been
described previously (44). In brief, a head holder composed of two
parallel micro-metal bars was attached to the animal’s skull to reduce
motion-induced artifact during imaging. Surgical anesthesia was
achieved with an intraperitoneal injection of KX [ketamine (100 mg/kg)
and xylazine (15 mg/kg)]. A midline incision of the scalp exposed
the periosteum, and a small skull region (~0.2 mm in diameter)
was located over the right motor cortex based on stereotactic
coordinates (0.5 mm posterior from the bregma and 1.5 mm lateral from
the midline) and marked with a pencil. A thin layer of cyanoacrylate-
based glue was first applied to the top of the entire skull surface
and to the metal bars, and the head holder was then further fortified
with dental acrylic cement. The dental cement was applied so that a
well was formed, leaving the motor cortex with the marked skull
region exposed between the two bars. All procedures were performed
under a dissection microscope. After the dental cement was com-
pletely dry, a cranial window was created over the previously marked
region. The procedures for preparing a thinned-skull cranial window
for two-photon imaging have been described in detail in previous
publications (45). The completed cranial window was covered with
silicon elastomer, and mice were given at least 1 day to recover from
the surgery-related anesthesia. Later, mice with head mounts were
habituated to the imaging apparatus a few times (10 min each time)
to minimize potential stress effects of head restraining and imaging.
To image neuronal Ca2+ activity in the cortex of awake mice, the
head holder was screwed to two metal cubes attached to a solid metal
base, and the silicon elastomer was peeled off to expose the thinned
skull region and artificial cerebrospinal fluid was added to the well.
The head-restrained animal was then placed on the stage of a two-
photon microscope. These in vivo Ca2+ imaging experiments were

 performed using an Olympus two-photon system equipped with a
DeepSee Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra-Physics). The average laser
power on the sample was ~20 to 30 mW. Most experiments were
acquired at frame rates of 2 Hz at a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels
using a 25× water immersion objective. Image acquisition was per-
formed using Olympus FV1000 software and analyzed post hoc
using National Institutes of Health (NIH) ImageJ software. DF/F0
was calculated by (F − F0)/F0, where F0 is the baseline fluorescence
signal averaged over a 2-s period. In Fig. 4E, Ca2+ transients were
defined as the events when changes of fluorescence (DF/F0) observed
in dendrites or soma were >20% during the 2.5-min imaging
sessions.
Motor skill training
Two motor tasks were used in this study. For the rotarod running task,
we used an EZRod system with a test chamber (44.5 cm × 14 cm × 51 cm
dimensions) to perform the test. Animals were placed on a motorized
rod (30 mm in diameter) in the chamber. The rotation speed
increased gradually from 0 to 100 rpm over the course of 3 min.
The time latency and rotation speed were recorded when the animals
were unable to keep up with the increasing speed and fell. Rotarod
training/testing was performed in one 30-min session (20 trials) per
day. Rotarod performance was measured as the average speed animals
achieved during the 20-trial training session. A treadmill running task
was introduced to provide a different motor training, as well as to per-
form two-photon Ca2+ imaging and motor training at the same time.
A custom-built, free-floating treadmill (96 cm × 56 cm × 61 cm
dimensions) was used to allow head-fixed mice to move their fore-
limbs freely to perform motor running tasks. At the onset of a trial,
the motor was turned on and the belt speed gradually increased from
0 to 8 cm/s within ~3 s, and the speed of 8 cm/s was maintained for
the rest of the trial.
Isolation of synaptosome fractions and Western blot
Mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused with 40 ml of Ca2+/Mg2+-free
Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline. The cortex was dissected and
homogenized with a dounce homogenizer in buffer A (320 mM su-
crose, 1 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM CaCl2) and cleared
of nuclei and insoluble material by centrifugation. The resulting super-
natant was centrifuged at 30,000g to pellet membranes, and the pellet
was subsequently resuspended in buffer B (320 mM sucrose and
1 mM NaHCO3). Membranes were fractionated using a discontinuous
sucrose gradient consisting of 1.0 and 1.2 M sucrose at 120,000g for
2 hours at 4°C. After centrifugation, the synaptosomal fraction was
isolated at the 1.0/1.2 interface, diluted in buffer B, and pelleted at
120,000g for 45 min at 4°C. The resulting synaptosomes were so-
lubilized in 25 mM tris (pH 7.4) and 2% SDS. Protein content was
determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Scientific), and 10 mg
of total protein was loaded per lane on a 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis gel. Separated proteins were transferred to a poly-
vinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and blocked for 30 min
with 2% bovine serum albumin in tris-buffered saline–Tween 20.
Blocked membranes were probed overnight with the following anti-
bodies: GluN1, GluN2A, GluA1, GluA2 (NeuroMab), and actin
(Sigma). After washing, membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit
or anti-mouse immunoglobulin G–horseradish peroxidase secondary
antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), washed, and incubated with
enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Life Sciences) before ex-
posure to film. Densitometry analysis was performed by manual
scanning and digitalization of film, and quantified using the gel anal-
ysis plugin for NIH ImageJ software.
In vivo imaging of dendritic spines and data analysis
The surgical procedure for chronic transcranial two-photon imaging
has been described previously (45). While the animal was under deep
anesthesia, the skull surface was exposed with a midline scalp incision,
and a small skull region (~0.2 mm in diameter) was located over the
primary motor cortex based on stereotaxic coordinates. A custom-
made, stainless steel plate was glued to the skull with a central opening
over the cortical region of interest. To create a cranial window for im-
aging, the skull surface was immersed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid,
and a high-speed drill and a microsurgical blade were used to carefully
reduce the skull thickness to about 20 mm under a dissection micro-
scope. The entire surgical procedure usually took less than 30 min,
and the two-photon imaging took place immediately after the skull
thinning. During imaging, the animal was placed under an Olympus
two-photon microscope with the laser tuned to the optimal excitation
wavelength for YFP (920 nm). Low laser power (20 to 30 mW at the
sample) was used during imaging to minimize phototoxicity. The
images were acquired with a 60× water immersion objective (numer-
ical aperture, 1.1) at a zoom of 1.0 to 3.0. A stack of image planes
within a depth of 100 mm from the pial surface was collected, yielding
a full three-dimensional data set of dendrites in the area of interest.
The step size was 2 mm for the initial low-magnification image (no
zoom) for relocation at later time points and 0.75 mm for all the other
experiments (×3.0 zoom). After imaging, the plate was gently detached
from the skull, and the scalp was sutured with 6-0 silk. The animals
were returned to their home cages until the next view.
Data analysis was performed with NIH ImageJ software as de-
scribed previously (23, 46). The same dendritic segments were identi-
fied from three-dimensional image stacks taken at both time points. The
number and location of dendritic protrusions were identified in each
view. Filopodia were identified as long, thin structures without enlarged
heads, and the rest of the protrusions were classified as spines. Spines
were considered the same between two views based on their spatial re-
lationship to adjacent landmarks and spines. Spines in the second view
were considered different if they were more than 0.7 mm away from
their expected positions based on the first view. The formation or elim-
ination rates of spines were measured as the number of spines formed
or eliminated divided by the number of spines existing in the first view.
Statistics
Prism software (GraphPad 6.0) was used to conduct the statistical
analysis. Data were presented as means ± SEM. Tests for differences
between populations were performed using Student’s t test or a one-
or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey or Bonferroni post hoc test as
specified in the text. For the post hoc multiple comparisons, all the
drug treatment groups were compared with the control group. Signif-
icant levels were set at P ≤ 0.05.
