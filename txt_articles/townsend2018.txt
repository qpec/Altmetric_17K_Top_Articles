Abstract: Recreation-based health and wellness programs for military service 
members are currently a topic of significant interest in the recreation and health 
industries. This study examined the health outcomes associated with participa-
tion in Project Sanctuary, a week-long recreation-based health and wellness family 
retreat for injured military service members. Linear mixed modeling was used to 
examine changes in health outcomes over four time points, and considered multiple 
covariates. One-hundred twenty-seven service members participated. Statistically 
significant reductions in total scores for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist 
(PCL) measures were found, as well as notable improvements in Depression, Anxiety, 
and Atress Scale (DASS) and mental health functioning immediately following the 
intervention. No changes were found in physical health functioning. Trends demon-
strated that participants maintained the positive psychological health changes over 
the three and six month time points. Veteran's Administration (VA) disability rate 
was the only significant covariate associated with health outcome change across 
timepoints. Implications for future practice and research are discussed in the article.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS
The majority of the authors of this article are 
therapists with years of experience working 
with injured military service members. Currently, 
Jasmine Townsend and Brent Hawkins are 
assistant professors at Clemson University, Jessie 
Bennett is an assistant professor at the University 
of New Hampshire, Jamie Hoffman is an assistant 
professor at Sacramento State University, and 
Tamar Martin is a visiting lecturer at Hunter 
College-CUNY. Elaine Sotherden, a doctoral 
candidate, and William Bridges, an emeritus 
professor, are both at Clemson University as well. 
The lines of research of these faculty are varied 
but center around helping service members 
recover and reintegrate into their homes and 
communities through the use of recreational 
therapy. This research aims to help strengthen the 
programs available for injured service members, 
and to provide the necessary evidence for various 
stakeholders to make appropriate and evidence-
based recommendations for future program 
funding and development.
PUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT
Support and recovery programs for injured service 
members are emerging at a rapid pace, and are 
becoming popular supplements and alternatives 
to Department of Defense (DoD) or VA-related 
treatment services. Preliminary evidence suggests 
positive short term outcomes stemming from 
recreation-based health and wellness programs, 
but very little evidence has examined long-term 
outcomes. The purpose of treatment services for 
injured service members is to help them recover, 
rehabilitate, and reintegrate into their homes and 
communities, but without sufficient evidence of 
the efficacy of these types of program, we are 
limited in our ability to make claims about their 
long-term effects. The purpose of this study was 
to extend the existing literature by exploring the 
long-term psychological and emotional health 
outcomes of a recreation-based health and 
wellness program. It is hoped that information 
such as this can enhance our knowledge about 
these types of programs, and augment our ability 
to make recommendations to them.

1. Introduction
Understanding the recovery and reintegration outcomes of injured military service members is an 
important task facing the allied health professions. Due to advances in technology, body armor, and 
battlefield healthcare, many service members injured in theater and non-deployment over the last 
15 years have survived injuries that would have been fatal in past wars (Dolan et al., 2012). Post-
traumatic stress (PTS) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are considered the signature injuries of 
Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom (OEF and OIF) with injury prevalence rates estimated at 17.1 
and 12–20%, respectively (Dohrenwend et al., 2006; Richardson, Frueh, & Acierno, 2010; 
Schneiderman, Braver, & Kang, 2008; Tanielian & Jaycox, 2008). Relatively high rates of substance 
abuse, homelessness, suicide, family problems, divorce, unemployment, and incarceration suggest 
that service members, defined in this study as individuals at any stage in their service history, are not 
successfully reintegrating into society (Hawkins, McGuire, Britt, & Linder, 2015; Resnik, Gray, & Borgia, 
2011; Sayer et al., 2010; Tanielian & Jaycox, 2008).
Spouses, partners, and children of service members also experience significant repercussions as-
sociated with being in a military family. The stresses of deployment, discharge and the associated 
military transition process, rehabilitation from injury, and adjustment to disability compound stress 
on the family. Many service members and their families feel overwhelmed as they transition through 
these phases and seek necessary health and reintegration resources (Butler, Linn, Meeker, McClain-
Meeder, & Nochajski, 2015; Danish & Antonides, 2013; Lester & Flake, 2016; Paley, Lester, & Mogil, 
2013; Sayers, 2011; Sayers, Farrow, Ross, & Oslin, 2009). These considerations highlight the impor-
tance of supporting service members and their families and providing them with the resources and 
coping strategies necessary to withstand the stressors associated with military life. In addition to 
the family, individual service members benefit from family support programs designed to help fami-
lies thrive and persevere through difficult transitions. In sum, there is a relationship between family 
reintegration and service member health (Sayers, Farrow, Ross, & Oslin, 2009), but to date, very little 
research has examined the health outcomes associated with programs that aim to help in recovery 
and reintegration.
1.1. Support programs for military service members
Medical services available to individuals with the most severe traumatic injuries are typically pro-
vided in a polytrauma/TBI system of care facility (US Department of Veterans Affairs, 2015). Once an 
injured service member is considered unfit for duty, he or she is often referred to a Warrior Transition 
Unit and begins the process of discharge from the military. The Veteran's Administration (VA) is the 
largest provider of health care to veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts and has served ap-
proximately 62% of the current generation of veterans (US Department of Veterans Affairs, 2017). 
However, not all veterans choose to solely utilize services provided by the Department of Defense 
(DoD) and VA for their medical, rehabilitation, and reintegration needs. Through resources provided 
by a government medical center or through their own efforts, service members often connect and 
utilize the services of nonprofit community-based organizations for support.
In this regard, the number of community-based nonprofit programs continues to grow across the 
US. The GuideStar Directory of Charities and Non-Profits lists over 80,000 organizations that have the 
words military, veteran, vets, or warrior in their title, implying that they serve some element of the 
military community (GuideStar, 2016). This estimate does not include other organizations who do 
 Page 3 of 17
Townsend et al., Cogent Psychology (2018), 5: 1444330
https://doi.org/10.1080/23311908.2018.1444330
not include these terms in their name but serve the military population nevertheless. Services of-
fered by these organizations range from “as-needed” services like employment and housing assis-
tance (e.g. Combat Vets to Careers and Honor House), special events like memorial celebrations (e.g. 
Honor Flights), and week-long retreat-style trips (e.g. Higher Ground and Project Sanctuary), to long-
term ongoing programming in the veteran’s local community (e.g. Hooves for Heroes and Project 
Healing Waters). Some programs offer services at no cost to the participants, some require a pay-
ment for services, others offer payment on a sliding scale based on ability to pay, and others request 
a small donation. Programs may also vary on eligibility requirements, with many prioritizing enroll-
ment based on participant need (i.e., severity of disability).
1.2. Recreation-based support programs
Military support programs are varied in their targeted outcomes and the methods they use to 
achieve them(see Griffiths & Townsend, 2018; for a brief discussion). Many military-focused non-
profit organizations use recreation, leisure, or sport as their primary services. For example, America’s 
Warrior Partnership’s Four Star Alliance serves as a resource for service members and their families 
looking for alternative support programs (America’s Warrior Partnership’s, 2018). Members of the 
Four Star Alliance are organizations that provide adaptive sports, recreation (therapeutic or non-
therapeutic), and other support services to military service members, veterans, and their families. 
Recreation can be used as a means to rehabilitate and reintegrate service members into their homes 
and communities (Hawkins et al., 2015). A small but growing body of literature is establishing evi-
dence of the beneficial outcomes of participation in these types of recreation programs. Recreation 
in the form of adapted sport and outdoor recreation (e.g. fly-fishing, river running, kayaking) has 
been associated with various beneficial outcomes for injured service members. These benefits in-
clude, but are not limited to, improved mood states (Lundberg, Bennett, & Smith, 2011), decreases 
in PTS, depression, and anxiety symptoms (Bennett, Piatt, & Van Puymbroeck, 2017; Caddick & Smith, 
2014; Dustin, Bricker, Arave, Wall, & Wendt, 2011; Scherer, Gade, & Yancosek, 2014), increases in 
motivation, social support and camaraderie (Bennett, Van Puymbroeck, Piatt, & Rydell, 2014; Caddick 
& Smith, 2014; Duvall & Kaplan, 2013; Hawkins, Cory, & Crowe, 2011; Mowatt & Bennett, 2011; 
Rogers, Loy, & Brown-Bochicchio, 2016; Sporner et al., 2009), improved perceived health and percep-
tion of disability (Hawkins et al., 2011), increased marital satisfaction (Bennett, Lundberg, Zabriskie, 
& Eggett, 2014), improved psychosocial well-being (Vella, Milligan, & Bennett, 2013), and community 
reintegration (Hawkins et al., 2015).
The majority of these studies examined only immediate impacts of the programs and are not able 
to speak to the sustainability of these health outcomes over longer time periods. Therefore, the long-
term outcomes of these recreation-based health and wellness programs remain relatively unknown. 
Further research is necessary to determine the long-term impacts of recreation-based health and 
wellness programs for service members. Program administrators and participants should be in-
formed of the anticipated outcomes associated with participation in these types of programs. 
Understanding program impact will also aid military care providers when suggesting or prescribing 
participation in programs to address specific concerns. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 
examine the health outcomes of participation in Project Sanctuary, a recreation-based health and 
wellness program, for injured service members in the following areas: (a) PTS, (b) depression, (c) 
anxiety, (d) stress, (e) physical health functioning, and (f) mental health functioning. Our hypothesis 
was as follows:
H0: There was no significant change across the time points in (1) PTS scores, (2) depression, 
anxiety, and stress scores, (3) physical health functioning scores, or (4) mental health 
functioning scores.
2. Methods
This study utilized an exploratory, longitudinal, quasi-experimental design and was approved by the 
Clemson University Institutional Review Board. These data were part of a larger study that explored 
outcomes of participation from four recreation-based programs affiliated with the Four Star Alliance. 
 Page 4 of 17
Townsend et al., Cogent Psychology (2018), 5: 1444330
https://doi.org/10.1080/23311908.2018.1444330
Of the four programs, only one program, Project Sanctuary, returned enough usable data to ade-
quately allow for hypothesis testing; therefore, they were the only program selected into this study.
2.1. Project sanctuary
Project Sanctuary is a no-cost, recreation-based, health and wellness program for injured military 
service members and their significant others. Services are delivered in a one-week retreat style set-
ting, and six to 12 couples are served at each retreat. Retreats are implemented at Project Sanctuary’s 
primary location in Colorado; however, they also partner with other organizations within the Four 
Star Alliance to implement their programming across the nation. The majority of participants do not 
live in close proximity to a Project Sanctuary site and travel for the week-long retreats. The goal of 
Project Sanctuary is to assist military couples in their recovery through an evidenced-based thera-
peutic program that focuses on physical, emotional, and spiritual healing. Their program model im-
plements five-day retreats that use a combination of recreational therapy, education, and couple 
and marriage counseling to address the needs of their military families. Recreational therapy ses-
sions used recreation activities and experiences appropriate to the season (e.g. snowmobiling, raft-
ing, equine activities, fishing, hiking) and are designed to help couples manage emotions and develop 
coping skills for stress management. Licensed professional counselors, certified recreational thera-
pists, medical social workers, trained peer mentors, and a registered nurse are present at all sessions 
to assist with therapeutic processing. Education sessions are focused on developing the tools that 
military families need to thrive during the reintegration process; sessions include marriage classes 
aimed at developing communication and relationships and financial management classes aimed at 
developing skills from basic budgeting to investment management. Over the course of the five-day 
retreats, sessions last between two and six hours, depending on the activity (i.e. healthy marriage 
session and white water rafting, respectively). Typically, each day consists of at least three to four 
distinct therapeutic sessions (Project Sanctuary, 2016).
Following the retreat, the participants are provided ongoing support at no charge for two years to 
continue the healing and adjustment process. Follow-up services include referrals to other military 
support programs such as Operation Homefront, other Four Star Alliance organizations, and mem-
bers of America’s Warrior Partnership’s national network. At any time, families can contact Project 
Sanctuary and request assistance in areas such as counseling for any family member, emergency 
financial assistance, ongoing financial education, assistance with housing solutions, and assistance 
with employment solutions.
2.2. Data collection
Data were collected using convenience sampling from service member participants of Project 
Sanctuary over a 14-month period during 2015–2016. Individuals registered for upcoming retreats 
were informed of the study by a Project Sanctuary administrator and invited to enroll. Declining in-
volvement in the study did not change their status as a participant at Project Sanctuary. The princi-
pal investigator trained the Project Sanctuary administrator in recruitment and data collection 
procedures prior to the start of the study. Training occurred over the phone and consisted of discus-
sions about appropriate ways to inform and recruit participants, as well as the timeline associated 
with sending out the survey links. The principal investigator notified the Project Sanctuary adminis-
trator one week before every testing period.
Participants who agreed to be in the study were administered the surveys by Project Sanctuary 
staff at four time points: pre- and post-retreat, and three and six months after completion of the 
retreat. Participants were emailed a link to the survey one week before they attended the retreat. 
Upon arrival, if they had not completed the survey online, they were given the opportunity to com-
plete it in paper format before the implementation of the therapeutic retreat services. Participants 
were given the choice of completing the post-test in paper format at the conclusion of the retreat 
before returning home, or completing it online when they returned home. All participants completed 
the post-test at Project Sanctuary in paper/pencil format. Participants received a survey web link to 
the three and six month follow-up surveys at appropriate times based on when they initially

Townsend et al., Cogent Psychology (2018), 5: 1444330

attended the program. Gift card incentives were given to individuals who completed the follow-up 
surveys ($10 for three month, $20 for six month). Number of responses over all testing periods is 
reported in Table 1.
Data were collected using three instruments. First, the PTS Disorder Checklist-Military (Weathers, 
Litz, Henmin, & Keane, 1993) was completed by participants. The PCL-M is a 17-item self-report 
measure that includes three subscales coinciding with symptom clusters as specified in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (American Psychiatric 
Association, 2000). The subscales include hyperarousal, avoidance, and re-experiencing. The meas-
ure has demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .97) (Weathers et al., 1993). 
Second, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scale (DASS) is a 21-item self-report questionnaire that 
measures the severity of a range of symptoms common to depression and anxiety (Gomez, 2016; 
Henry & Crawford, 2005). Previous research has reported acceptable reliability for total DASS scores, 
(Cronbach’s α = .93; Henry & Crawford, 2005). Last, the Veterans RAND Health Survey (VR-12) is a 
12-item short form that measures self-reported physical and mental health functioning (Selim et al., 
2009). The measure demonstrates good construct validity, content validity, and internal consistency 
(Selim et al., 2009), and has demonstrated acceptable reliability for both the physical (α = .90) and 
mental health (α = .76) component scores (Eisen et al., 2012). These measures and constructs were 
chosen based upon the Four Star Alliance and Project Sanctuary’s interests in understanding the 
symptomatology and health impacts on service member participants who attend their program.
While Project Sanctuary’s services focus specifically on couples, given the exploratory nature of 
this study and available resources, data were only collected from the service member, as opposed to 
service member and their spouse/partner. A variety of personal and military related demographics 
were collected including gender, marital status, ethnicity, employment, and income, as well as 
branch of military, rank, duty status, wars served, VA benefits rating (as a proxy of severity of disabil-
ity), number of months deployed, and number of years served. Descriptive health information was 
also reported, including current health conditions, time since most recent combat-related injury, 
and use of non-recreation based treatment services. Demographic data were collected across all 
time points to capture changes in demographic information (e.g. health condition, marital status); 
however, only pre-test responses were reported in Tables 2 and 3, and Figure 1.
2.3. Data analysis
The data analysis was driven by our primary objective to determine change in health outcomes 
across time. As previously described, we measured 10 outcomes: four main outcomes from the Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL), DASS, and VR-12, of which PCL and DASS are combined 
scores, each with three sub-measures of, respectively, re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarous-
al, and depression, anxiety, and stress. The VR-12 has two component scores, one for physical health 
functioning (PCS) and one for mental health functioning (MCS). Descriptive statistics were performed 
on personal, military, and health demographic data. Based on clinical knowledge about this popula-
tion, eight covariates were selected from the collected demographic information, and included gen-
der, employment, income, branch, rank, VA benefits rate (VArate), time since injury (timeinjury), and 
receipt of other treatment services (txserv).
2.4. Model sequence
Five sets of models were used to explore the changes in health outcomes over time. The models 
varied from a very simple model (Model A) that included only fixed effect terms of participant and

time, to a more realistic model (Model E) that included terms for a random effect of participant, a 
fixed effect of time, and a selected covariate that was related to the response variables (see Table 4).
3. Results
3.1. Model results
The final model chosen for analysis was Model E with VA rate as the only significant covariate in-
cluded (see Table 4). Using this model, a significant difference was observed in the pre-test outcome 
means as compared to the outcome means at times 2, 3, and 4 for PCL-M and hyperarousal (see 
Table 5). The final model also indicated a significant difference in the posttest outcome mean as 
compared to the outcome mean at times 1, 3, and 4 for the outcome MCS. None of the other out-
come measures demonstrated any statistically significant changes over time. For trend graphs on 
outcome measures PCL, DASS, PCS, and MCS (sub-scales not included), refer to Figures 2–5.
3.2. Response rates
During the study time period, 144 couples attended Project Sanctuary, and all were invited to partici-
pate in the study; 127 individuals completed the pre-test (88.2% initial response rate), 69 completed 
the post-test (53.4%); 56 completed the three month follow-up (44.1%), and 44 completed the six

month follow-up (34.6%). Attrition over the study time frame was expected, and the post-test and 
two follow-up response rates were relatively high given the survey length (30–40 min) and how 
many times it was completed over the study time period.
Each of the 127 participants provided responses with either no demographic information (n = 52), 
partial demographic information (n = 65), or full demographic information (n = 10). Each participant 
had the opportunity to complete the survey at four time points: Pre (time 1), Post (time 2), three 
months (time 3), and six months (time 4). Of these, very few participants gave complete responses 
and complete demographic (covariate) information at all four time periods (n = 14). An empty re-
sponse was defined as either a survey not returned or a survey returned with no response informa-
tion. There was a notable increase in the number of empty surveys in the later time periods; for each 
time there were, respectively, 21, 58, 71, and 83 empty surveys (see Table 1). Cronbach’s α scores 
were calculated for the PCL-M and DASS total scales, and were within acceptable ranges (Crombach’s 
α of .97 each).

The data were screened for unusual response patterns to determine if elimination of responses 
was necessary. An unusual survey profile was defined as those who did not provide a given response 
at any of the four times, those who only gave a response for times three or four, or those who only 
returned the survey at times three and four. Contextually, these respondents were not tracked 
across time. There was no systemic change in the analysis by removing participants with non-re-
sponses, so their survey results were included in the analysis. Further, investigation found no obvious 
indication that participants who were more or less inclined to return the surveys had systematically 
higher or lower responses; this removed concerns about systematic non-response across time. 
Therefore, no data were discarded due to non-response.
3.3. Sample characteristics
Participants in this study were predominantly male (77.2%), white (63%), and married (81.1%). 
Approximately 52% of the participants were employed part or full-time, with a median household 
income range of $45,000–$54,999. All branches of the US armed services were represented except 
the Coast Guard, with the majority being in the Army (63%) and serving in OIF (63.8%) and/or OEF 
(63%). Most of the participants were retired or discharged (52.8%) and had served an average of 
10.97 years in the military. Orthopedic injuries (61.4%), anxiety (57.5%), PTS (57.5%), sleep disorders 
(56.7%), depression (49.6%), hearing impairments (40.9%), and TBI (35.6%) were the most self-re-
ported health conditions for the participants of Project Sanctuary (see Tables 2 and 3, and Figure 1 
for more detailed demographic information).
4. Discussion
The intention in this study was to explore the long-term outcomes associated with participation in a 
recreation-based health and wellness program for service members. Results from this study are con-
sistent with the previous literature demonstrating immediate positive impacts (c.f., Bennett, Lundberg, 
et al., 2014; Lundberg et al., 2011), but extend the literature by identifying improvements in psychologi-
cal symptoms sustained over a six-month timeframe (see Figure 2). While not all measures and their 
subscales demonstrated statistically significant results, the trends over time reveal positive and sus-
tained reductions in posttraumatic stress symptoms. These findings may be the first to demonstrate 
that changes in posttraumatic stress can be sustained to some degree following a one-week retreat.

While positive changes in emotional and mental health were found at post-test, they were not 
sustained over time. In fact, scores on these measures were worse at three months, followed by 
slight improvements again at six month, with the exception of the MCS scores. The score fluctuation 
at three months may be due to changes in the service members personal life (e.g. changes in medica-
tions or treatments, employment or marital status, holiday stress) that negatively impacted emo-
tional and mental health. Changes in six months may be due to a variety of reasons as well (e.g. using 
coping skills gained at Project Sanctuary, participation in other treatments or programs, natural im-
provement after difficult times). Approximately 60% of participants were receiving other treatments 
while participating in Project Sanctuary, and these may have contributed to the fluctuation in scores 
over time. Future research should attempt to control for or keep track of confounding treatment 
services received and the occurrence of stressful life events during the course of the study period.
Physical health scores showed no significant decrease or increase across time periods despite the 
use of physically engaging recreation activities in programming at Project Sanctuary. It may be that 
the effect of these activities is reflected more in psychological functioning than physical functioning. 
Furthermore, Project Sanctuary is not a physical rehabilitation program and, therefore, is not de-
signed to impact physical health.
Out of the eight covariates included in the models, only the VA benefits rate contributed to the 
variance in outcome measures. The VA benefits rate is used to determine the amount of financial 
compensation provided to injured service members who are separated from the military and takes 
into account the severity of disability resulting from their military-related injuries or health condi-
tions (US Department of Veterans Affairs, 2018). For the purposes of this study, it was used as a 
proxy for severity of disability: higher rates indicate more severe disabilities or health conditions. 
Participants in our study who had a higher VA benefits rate, also had high scores on the PCL and 
DASS at pre-test. It would be important for future work to explore the relationship between the VA 
benefits rate and treatment outcomes. With larger sample sizes and more complete responses 
across all measures and time points, an analysis could include comparisons of outcomes between 
high and low VA rate groups (50% cut point; Edens, Kasprow, Tsai, & Rosenheck, 2011). Group com-
parisons may help determine which service member group has better outcomes over time. Military-
focused health and wellness programs may find this type of information helpful when determining 
prospective participant enrollment to maximize health outcome achievement.
Our sample had a large proportion of individuals who did not provide a VA benefit rate (48%), 
which made further examination of the covariate difficult. A potential reason for the low response 
rate on this item may have been due to the ambiguity in the item wording (i.e. If you are retired or 
discharged, what is your VA disability rating, if any?). This may have led participants with no VA ben-
efit rate to leave their response blank, rather than respond with “none” or “zero” to indicate no VA 
benefit rate. Consequently, it was impossible to determine if blank responses were participants who 
did not have a VA benefit rate (zero) or participants who intentionally did not respond even though

they had a VA benefits rate. Additionally, VA benefit rates are only provided to individuals fully sepa-
rated from the military and who are willing to seek to obtain a rate. Approximately 42% of our sam-
ple reported their duty status as active, guard, or reserve, meaning they were ineligible to receive a 
VA benefits rate at the time of the study, further complicating the understanding of the non-re-
sponses to the VA rate question. In light of these challenges, future research should continue to 
explore the use of the VA benefit rate as a proxy for severity of disability, as well as provide a more 
explicit response option to obtain a precise understanding of this variable and its relationship to 
outcomes. Additionally, our study determined that the VA benefit rate was a good summary of a 
variety of other military related variables (rank, income, and employment). When considering the 
burden of survey length for this population, having one variable that could explain significant 
amounts of variance in the response measures would be preferred over multiple variables that ex-
plain the same variance.
4.1. Clinical interpretation of findings
The findings from this study yield numerous implications for practice. Participants in our study dem-
onstrated an almost 7-point decrease in PCL total scores from pre- to post-testing, and an 8-point 
decrease from pre-test to six month follow-up. A 5-point change in total PCL scores is recommended 
for determining whether an individual responded to an intervention, and a 10-point change is con-
sidered a clinically meaningful difference (National Center for PTSD, 2012). This finding suggests that 
participants may have had significant positive responses in regards to posttraumatic stress symp-
toms during the intervention. There were slight fluctuations in scores over the follow-up time points, 
but the positive responses were maintained over time.
Similarly, clinically meaningful changes were demonstrated for the DASS scores; however, they 
were not consistently maintained over time. While there is no clinical severity cut-off for total DASS 
scores, individual subscales can be classified as either normal, mild, moderate, severe, or extremely 
severe (Gomez, 2016). Results showed reclassifications of the DASS scales at various time points. At 
pre-test, participants scored in the moderate range on the depression and stress scales and severe 
on the anxiety scale. At post-test, their scores improved to a mild classification on the depression 
and stress scales, while anxiety remained severe. In follow-up time points, the depression and stress 
scales reverted back to moderate classification, while anxiety improved to moderate at the six 
month time point.

Finally, mental health functioning as measured by the VR-12 showed over a 5-point increase in 
scores from pre- to post-test. Previous research has indicated a 1-point increase in scores is associ-
ated with 7% lower health care expenditures, 4% lower pharmacy expenditures, 15% lower rate of 
hospital inpatient visits, and 4% lower rate of medical provider visits (Boston University School of 
Public Health, 2016; Kazis et al., 2004, 2006). This increase in mental health functioning at post-test 
may have resulted in better health care experiences for the participants immediately following their 
time at Project Sanctuary, but, for reasons that are unexplained by this study, positive health care 
occurrences were likely not experienced long-term. Mental health functioning at six month follow-
up had reverted to levels found at pre-test. It is important to consider that our findings may reflect 
an improvement to some degree in specific mental health symptoms as measured by the DASS, but 
they do not reflect consistent improvements in mental health functioning (and related health care 
experiences) as measured by the MCS scale in the VR-12.
These clinical interpretations provide a more balanced understanding of the changes experienced 
by participants in the program, and should not be dismissed due to limited overall statistical signifi-
cance in this study. From a clinical perspective, finding reductions in negative symptomology is a 
step forward in the process of recovery. Individuals start their recovery at different stages and pro-
gress at different rates. Our sample included individuals on the highest end of the scales for the PCL 
and DASS scores (i.e. most severe symptoms; see Figures 2 and 3), suggesting that some participants 
were in great need for services. Even incremental changes allow the individual to experience some 
reprieve from negative symptoms, and basing a program’s impact solely on statistical evidence 
would be shortsighted.
4.2. Limitations and recommendations
The primary limitation of this study concerns the small sample size and the amount of missing data 
on measures across the time points. Numerous attempts were made to keep attrition low including 
survey administration by a Project Sanctuary employee (trained by the researchers), periodic re-
minders over the study time period, and the use of incentives. Gift cards were offered for completion

https://doi.org/10.1080/23311908.2018.1444330
of surveys at follow-up time points; nevertheless, attrition occurred at a rate that was not preferable 
in spite of these efforts. Sample size and attrition limited the ability to deeply analyze and explore 
the trends in the data, and to explore the relationships between covariates and outcomes by creat-
ing groups (i.e. high VA benefits rate vs. low VA benefits rate). As a result, generalizability is some-
what limited beyond this study.
Future research should focus on gathering more completed responses from participants across 
the study time points, which can take considerable effort. Many suggestions for maintaining partici-
pant involvement in research emerged from this study. Establishing a dedicated staff member from 
Project Sanctuary as a liaison to the research team was vital to the recruitment of participants and 
distribution of survey links at the appropriate times. However, there is a need for more personal fol-
low-up with participants across all time points to promote survey completion after pre-test. Gift card 
incentives assisted with continued survey completion at follow-up time points; however, it is likely 
that they also contributed to the completion of follow-up surveys by participants who did not com-
plete one or both of the pre- and post-tests, further complicating the data-set. A recommendation 
is to offer incentives for completion of all time points, in addition to personal follow-ups.
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no control group was used which limits this study’s 
ability to attribute health outcomes to Project Sanctuary’s program. Future research examining the 
outcomes of military-focused health and wellness programs would benefit from including a control 
group to allow for stronger examinations of program outcomes.
Also, the relationship between health outcomes and Project Sanctuary’s programmatic elements 
were not examined in this study. These elements should be explored in future work to determine the 
mechanisms of health outcome change. Furthermore, Project Sanctuary offers continued treatment 
and support services following the retreats. It is possible that some services were accessed, thus 
contributing to the outcome trends over time. Follow-up services would likely contribute to lasting 
effects in the months following the initial program, as would repeat experiences at the retreat (i.e. 
booster experiences). Gathering data on follow-up services, in addition to primary programmatic 
elements, would help explain the contributors to health outcomes over time.
Finally, this study examined the symptomology and overall health outcomes associated with 
Project Sanctuary. However, a primary purpose of Project Sanctuary is to help service members and 
their families with development of coping skills as well to improve overall family functioning. It is 
possible that the therapeutic activities used to achieve the aims of Project Sanctuary had no effect 
on the symptomology measured in the study, given that they are different, and may explain the lack 
of statistically significant changes over time. Future studies with Project Sanctuary, as with other 
programs, should measure outcomes that better match the intended programmatic outcomes and 
purpose of the program.
5. Conclusions
Taken as a whole, the results of this exploratory examination of health outcomes are positive and 
provide useful information to proceed with addressing the health needs of injured service members 
in programs and development of future research. However, findings should be considered prelimi-
nary given the study’s limitations. Recreation-based health and wellness programs are emerging as 
complementary services for injured service members who seek options in addition to the standard 
treatments available through the VA and DoD. Recreation programs for service members exist 
throughout the country; however, it is recommended that recreation-based programs increase their 
availability within the communities where service members and their families reside. As witnessed 
at Project Sanctuary, participants had to travel from out-of-state to attend the retreat. Increasing 
the programmatic reach within service member communities will help address the gaps in care for 
injured service members (Kizer & Jha, 2014). These programs should be easily accessible to support 
ongoing recovery, adjustment, and reintegration.

Finally, only a small handful of studies exist that examine the outcomes of participation in these 
types of programs with little indication of the long-term outcomes (c.f., Bennett, Lundberg, et al., 
2014; Lundberg et al., 2011). This study is unique in its contribution to the body of knowledge sur-
rounding recreation-based health and wellness programs for service members by examining health 
outcomes over six months, which established a preliminary trend of sustained reductions in PTS 
symptoms. While limited in scope, results are promising; they contribute to our understanding of the 
effects of these types of programs for service members, and highlight the need for more rigorous 
research examining extended outcomes. Studies should be replicated using a variety of recreation-
based health and wellness programs. This work would allow researchers to make stronger conclu-
sions about the effects of these types of programs, further enhance the knowledge about these 
programs, and augment the ability of health professionals to make recommendations for these 
types of services.
