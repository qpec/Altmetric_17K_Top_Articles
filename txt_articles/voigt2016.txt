Abstract
Objective: There is ongoing debate whether cancer qualifies as traumatic stressor. We investigated
prevalence and course of posttraumatic stress in patients with early breast cancer (BC) during their
first year after diagnosis and determined effects of mastectomy and chemotherapy.
Methods: Patients with stage 0–III BC aged ≤65 years were evaluated with the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV modules for acute and posttraumatic stress disorder (ASD and PTSD, respec-
tively) before treatment, after chemotherapy, and 1 year after diagnosis. Matched controls were
assessed at matched intervals. Effects of time, mastectomy, and chemotherapy on BC-related PTSD
symptom severity were tested with linear mixed model analysis.
Results: Stress disorder (ASD or PTSD) related to BC was diagnosed in 6 (3.6%) of 166 patients be-
fore treatment and in 3 patients (2.0%) 1 year later. The rate of patients who experienced PTSD symp-
toms related to BC decreased from 82.5 to 57.3% (p < 0.001), and the mean of BC-related PTSD
symptoms diminished from 3.1 to 1.7 (p < 0.001). Only university education significantly predicted
the course of BC-related PTSD symptom severity (p = 0.009). In 60 controls, no diagnosis of stress dis-
order, a rate of 18% women experiencing PTSD symptoms, and a mean of 0.4 PTSD symptoms (p vs.
patients <0.001) were found.
Conclusions: Most newly diagnosed patients with BC experience PTSD symptoms, whereas full di-
agnoses of DSM-IV stress disorder are rare. Symptoms diminish somewhat within 1 year furthered by
university education but independently from mastectomy and chemotherapy. Throughout the year af-
ter diagnosis, having BC entails markedly increased PTSD symptom burden.

Background
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs after expo-
sure to extremely stressful events and is characterized by
symptoms of intrusion (e.g. involuntary recurrent memo-
ries, dreams, or flashbacks of the stressor), avoidance
(e.g. efforts to avoid memories, thoughts, feelings, or
reminders associated with the stressor), emotional numb-
ing, and hyperarousal [1]. In the general population, 12-
month prevalence of PTSD is reported to be about 3.5%
in the USA and to cluster around 0.5–1.0% in Europe
[2]. Since life-threatening illness was included as poten-
tially traumatic event in DSM-IV [1], a growing body of
research has investigated cancer-related PTSD predomi-
nantly in breast cancer (BC) populations.
In studies that used clinical interviews based on DSM-
IV criteria [3–8], rates of PTSD related to BC varied be-
tween 2.4 [6] and 6% [8]. Higher rates were found when
PTSD
was
assessed
with
self-report
questionnaires
[9,10]. These instruments, however, do not involve

 clinical judgment, which is particularly necessary to eval-
uate severity and clinical significance of symptoms and
avoid improper symptom endorsement [4,9]. Self-report
questionnaires bear therefore a strong risk of false-positive
diagnosis of PTSD [5], and poor concordance of question-
naires and clinical interviews has occasionally been ob-
served [4,11].
PTSD symptoms that do not amount to a full diagnosis
of stress disorder have been found to be common in pa-
tients with BC [4,12–16]. Associations with low quality
of life [12] and impaired functioning [17,18] were ob-
served. Again, the bulk of these results was obtained with
self-report questionnaires and may therefore overestimate
the load of BC-related posttraumatic stress.
Rates of PTSD diagnosis in patients with cancer that do
not exceed the base rate of PTSD in the general population
of the USA [5] as well as atypical features of cancer as a
traumatic stressor—fears are future-oriented and based on
a realistic, ongoing threat—have fueled debate over the ad-
equacy of the PTSD framework for cancer-related stress
[5–7,19–21]. In the recently published DSM-V, only ‘sud-
den, catastrophic’ medical incidents (‘e.g. waking during
surgery, anaphylactic shock’) but ‘not necessarily’ life-
threatening illness qualify as traumatic stressors. If patients
show PTSD symptoms in response to an event that is not
considered a traumatic stressor, adjustment disorder
should be diagnosed according to DSM-V [2].
Very few studies of PTSD in patients with cancer com-
prised a matched control group [3,15]. Further, only three
of the longitudinal studies [5,6,10,13,17,22–24] included
a full diagnostic assessment with a validated clinical inter-
view that was administered once [6,17] or twice at an in-
terval of 3 months [5], and none tested posttraumatic
stress prior to treatment. Information on the extent of
cancer-related posttraumatic stress in relation to the popu-
lation base rate, its course, and the role of cancer treat-
ments is therefore limited.
The present report is part of the Cognition in Breast
Cancer Patients: The Impact of Cancer-Related Stress
(COGNICARES) study [18]. In this controlled study with
repeated clinical assessments, prevalence and course of
posttraumatic stress in patients with cancer in the first year
after diagnosis, particularly with regard to cancer treat-
ments, were investigated as a preplanned secondary
objective.
Methods
Participants and procedures
Enrolment
and
assessment
proceedings
in
the
COGNICARES study have previously been reported
[18]. Briefly, women who were newly diagnosed with
stage 0–IIIc BC (patients) or had undergone routine breast
imaging with negative result (controls) were eligible if
they were between the ages of 18 and 65 years, fluent in
German, free of substance abuse, without a history of
psychosis or neurologic disease, and had never received
any systemic treatment for cancer. All participants gave
written informed consent. The COGNICARES study
was approved by the ethics committee of the Ludwig
Maximilian University of Munich and is registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT01264562.
Assessments were scheduled between diagnosis of can-
cer and prior to any cancer therapy including lumpectomy
and mastectomy (T1), after chemotherapy (T2), and 1 year
after T1 (T3); and at matched intervals for non-
chemotherapy patients and controls. All assessments took
place face to face and were conducted by master’s level
psychologists who had received expert training on PTSD
diagnostics. Uncertainties as to whether or not a specific
presentation
represented
a
symptom
were
jointly
discussed, and consensus was reached.
Measures
History of PTSD, current PTSD or acute stress disorder
(ASD), and number of current PTSD symptoms related
to cancer or to other stressors were assessed with the
PTSD and ASD modules of the validated German version
of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)
[25]. At all time points, PTSD symptoms related to cancer
were fully inquired in disregard of the SCID skipping
rules, that is, even if the patient had not reacted to the can-
cer diagnosis with intense fear, helplessness, or horror
(criterion A) [1]. Additionally, in patients and controls
alike, the non-BC traumatic event rated the worst by the
participant was inquired at T1 as prescribed, that is, only
if criterion A was met. At T2 and T3, non-BC traumatic
events were only investigated if they had happened after
the previous assessment.
According to DSM-IV, symptoms have to persist for at
least 1 month for a diagnosis of PTSD. In the first month
after the onset of symptoms, ASD is diagnosed if symp-
toms of derealization/dissociation are found in addition
to PTSD symptoms. Therefore, ASD symptoms were
assessed in addition to PTSD symptoms if the cancer diag-
nosis or another traumatic event dated back less than
1 month.
Symptoms were regarded as current if they had been
present in a time frame of approximately 1 month prior
to the assessment.
Demographic and medical data were collected from the
participants and extracted from medical records.
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups of participants were deter-
mined with Student’s t-test, Mann–Whitney U test, chi-
squared test, or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.
Cochran’s Q test was used to longitudinally compare

 proportions of patients with BC who experienced at least
one BC-related PTSD symptom, presented specific PTSD
symptoms, and met specific PTSD criteria. The overall
number of BC-related PTSD symptoms at T1, T2, and
T3 was compared with the Friedman test.
Linear mixed model analysis was conducted to test the
effects of time and cancer treatments on PTSD symptoms.
The number of current PTSD symptoms was entered as
dependent variable. Time (T1, T2, or T3), mastectomy,
chemotherapy, and factors that have been found to influ-
ence PTSD symptoms in previous studies, namely tumor
stage [13,15], age [10,23,26], partnership status [11,26],
education [13,26] (dummy-coded), and history of PTSD
[6,17,22,26], and their interaction with time were included
as predictors. IBM SPSS Statistics 22 and 23 (Armonk,
NY: IBM Corp.) and the software R [27], packages lme4
(Bates, Maechler, Bolker & Walker, 2014) and lmerTest
(Kuznetsova, Brockhoff & Christensen, 2014) were uti-
lized for all analyses. Two-sided p values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
Of 226 participants (166 patients and 60 controls) who
underwent the pretreatment assessment, 215 (157 patients
and 58 controls) and 206 (150 patients and 56 controls)
also completed the T2 and T3 assessment, respectively
(overall attrition: n=20, 8.8%). Reasons for exclusion
were refusal to participate further (five patients, one con-
trol), time constraints (five patients, one control), onset
of neurologic disorder (two patients), diagnosis of metas-
tases (one patient), diagnosis of cancer (one control), and
death (one patient). Two patients and one control could
not be reached. Excluded participants did not significantly
differ from continuers regarding age, partnership status,
education, tumor stage, number of PTSD symptoms at
the first assessment, and history of PTSD.
The T2 and T3 assessments took place 7.5 months
(mean, 33.0 weeks; SD, 3.8 weeks) and 1 year (mean,
55.1 weeks; SD, 3.5 weeks) after T1, respectively. These
intervals did not significantly differ between patients and
controls.
Participant and treatment characteristics
Characteristics of the participants and details of enrolment
have previously been reported [18]. Briefly, patients and
controls did not significantly differ on age (mean, SD:
50.4, 9.1 and 52.6, 7.8, respectively; p=0.13), education
(p=0.20), or first language (German, patients: 89.2%,
controls: 96.7%; p=0.08). More controls than patients
were partnered (83.3 and 66.3%, respectively; p=0.01).
All 157 patients who completed more than the pretreat-
ment assessment had surgery (breast-conserving, 116 pa-
tients, 73.9%; mastectomy, 41 patients, 26.1%) either
between T1 and T2 (150 patients, 95.5%) or between T2
and T3 (7 patients, 4.5%). Ninety-one patients (58.0%)
were treated with chemotherapy, which was completed a
median of 8.1 weeks before T2 (interquartile range, 5.9
to 11.9 weeks). One patient restarted chemotherapy after
T2. During the study period, 82 patients (52.2% of the pa-
tients) and six controls (10.3% of the controls) had at least
one session of psychotherapy or psychological counseling
as part of routine care or self-sought in private practice.
Posttraumatic stress related to stressors other than BC
Equal proportions of patients and controls had experi-
enced at least one traumatic event other than BC. The na-
ture of these events did not differ between the groups
(Table 1). Ten patients (6%) and three controls (5%) had
a history of PTSD [18] because of sexual assault (n=5),
physical attack (n=1), violent or sudden death of a be-
loved one (n=2), or health-related events (n=5). The only
current non-BC-related stress disorder was seen in one pa-
tient at T3 who had a diagnosis of PTSD because of
suspected
gynecologic
cancer.
Thirty-eight
patients
(22.9%) and 11 controls (18.3%) currently experienced
at least one PTSD symptom because of non-BC-related
stressors at T1 (number of symptoms in patients: mean,
0.6, SD, 1.3, n=166; and in controls: mean, 0.4, SD,
1.1, n=60; p=0.51).
Posttraumatic stress related to BC
Stress disorder because of BC was found in six patients
(3.6%; PTSD, two patients; ASD, four patients) [18] after
diagnosis, before the start of treatment (T1), and in three
patients at T2 and T3 (1.9 and 2.0%, respectively, all
PTSD). Of 71 patients with BC who also reported trau-
matic experiences other than BC, 28 (39.4%) evaluated
BC as the more severe stressor (Table 1).
The number of patients who experienced at least one
PTSD symptom related to BC decreased from 137
(82.5%) at T1 to 110 (70.1%) at T2 and 86 (57.3%) at
T3 (p<0.001). The mean number of current PTSD symp-
toms related to BC declined from 3.1 (SD, 2.7, n=166) at
T1 to 2.1 (SD, 2.3, n=157) at T2 and 1.7 (SD, 2.3,
n=150) at T3 (p<0.001, Figure 1). If symptoms of pa-
tients who did not meet criterion A were disregarded—
these symptoms would not have been found if the SCID
skipping rules had been observed—the numbers changed
marginally (T1: mean, 2.9, SD, 2.8; T2: mean, 2.1, SD,
2.3; T3: mean, 1.7, SD, 2.3); they were significantly dif-
ferent from the number of PTSD symptoms found in con-
trols (p<0.001 for all time points). Prevalence, nature,
and course of BC-related PTSD symptoms are shown in
Table 2 and Figure 1.
In bivariate comparisons, patients who received che-
motherapy or mastectomy did not significantly differ
from other patients with regard to the number of PTSD
symptoms at any time point (data not shown). In a mixed

 linear model, only the interaction of time with the highest
level of education (university degree) but neither time
alone nor chemotherapy or mastectomy significantly
predicted the number of BC-related PTSD symptoms
(Table 3).
Conclusions
While our study corroborates findings of low rates of
PTSD related to BC that were reported from previous in-
vestigations [9,28], it also demonstrates that the vast
majority of patients with BC experience PTSD symptoms.
The rate of BC-related PTSD or, in the first month after di-
agnosis of cancer, ASD decreased from 3.6% before treat-
ment to only 2% at 1 year; nevertheless, as many as 82.5%
of the patients initially showed BC-related PTSD symp-
toms that had not resolved in 57.3% a year later.
In contrast to previous findings [9,22,24], BC-related
posttraumatic stress statistically significantly diminished
during the year after diagnosis, with mean numbers
of three PTSD symptoms before treatment and less
than
two
symptoms
12
months
later.
If
basic
sociodemographic, medical, and treatment-related factors
and their interaction with time were taken into account,
however, the effect of time lost significance and was
dispersed into multiple interaction effects. Only the
interaction of time with the highest level of education—
university degree—reached statistical significance. These
results indicate that whereas high educational levels do
not prevent the development of BC-related posttraumatic
stress, particularly university education is apparently
associated with resources that promote successful coping
and recovery.
Our study confirms that posttraumatic stress in patients
with BC is primarily because of cancer diagnosis [6,29].
Chemotherapy and mastectomy were not found to signif-
icantly contribute to PTSD symptoms, possibly because
of a lack of statistical power; however, previous studies
have likewise not detected an effect of these treatments
[4,26]. The effect of history of PTSD on BC-related
PTSD symptoms, which has been observed in previous
investigations [6,17,26], was not statistically significant
in our study. Only ten patients had a history of PTSD;
therefore, this effect was tested with very limited statisti-
cal power.

 The load of posttraumatic stress because of other rea-
sons than BC was very low, as to be expected [2,30],
and did not differ between patients and controls, despite
a higher rate of partnered women and therefore possibly
better social support in the control group. In the year cov-
ered by the study, none of the controls and only one pa-
tient had a diagnosis of current non-BC-related PTSD,
induced by suspected gynecologic malignancy. A rate of
18.3% of controls suffered from current PTSD symptoms,
and the mean number of current PTSD symptoms was
only 0.4 in controls. Nearly equal proportions of patients
and controls, 6 and 5%, respectively, had a history of
PTSD diagnosis, and in both groups, approximately 42%
had experienced a stressor other than BC that qualified
as potentially traumatic event according to DSM-IV
criteria. As observed in a previous investigation [3], many
cancer patients—almost 40%—rated cancer as more
stressful than the worst other traumatic event they had
experienced.
The strengths of our study include a prospective longi-
tudinal design with repeated administration of a validated
clinical interview, baseline assessment prior to the start of
any local or systemic treatment for BC, a large sample, a
well-matched control group, and low attrition. Several
limitations have to be acknowledged. Firstly, women with
substance abuse, history of psychosis or neurologic dis-
ease, or non-proficiency in German were excluded. These
women may be at especially high risk of posttraumatic
stress [13,26]; thus, PTSD and ASD cases and PTSD
symptoms may have been somewhat underestimated in
our study. Secondly, even though the sample was large
in comparison with samples of most previous studies, it
may still have been too small to detect specific effects of
mastectomy and chemotherapy. Further, it needs to be
mentioned that more than half of the patients received pro-
fessional psychological support that may have alleviated
posttraumatic stress.
The findings indicate that against the backdrop of low
base rates of PTSD diagnosis and PTSD symptoms in
the female population in Germany, having non-metastatic
BC substantially increases the load of posttraumatic
stress. After diagnosis, the vast majority of patients with
BC suffer from PTSD symptoms, which are still present
in more than half of the patients 1 year later, indepen-
dently from tumor stage, type of surgery, and chemother-
apy. A small—although not negligible—subgroup of
patients develop full DSM-IV stress disorder. Clinicians
should be aware that patients with BC are very likely to
suffer from PTSD symptoms, and adequate support
should be available.
