 Generation of tumor-specific T cells is critically important for cancer immunotherapy1,2. A major 
challenge in achieving a robust T cell response is the spatio-temporal orchestration of antigen 
cross-presentation in antigen presenting cells (APCs) with innate stimulation. Here we report a 
minimalist nanovaccine by a simple physical mixture of an antigen with a synthetic polymeric 
nanoparticle, PC7A NP, which generated a strong cytotoxic T cell response with low systemic 
cytokine expression. Mechanistically, PC7A NP achieved efficient cytosolic delivery of tumor 
antigens to APCs in draining lymph nodes leading to increased surface presentation while 
simultaneously activating type I interferon-stimulated genes. This effect was dependent on STING 
but not Toll-like receptor or MAVS pathway. Nanovaccine produced potent tumor growth 
inhibition in melanoma, colon cancer, and human papilloma virus-E6/E7 tumor models. 
Combination of PC7A nanovaccine with an anti-PD-1 antibody showed great synergy with 100% 
survival over 60 days in a TC-1 tumor model. Rechallenging of these tumor-free animals with 
TC-1 cells led to complete inhibition of tumor growth, suggesting generation of long-term 
antitumor memory. The STING-activating nanovaccine offers a simple, safe and robust strategy in 
boosting anti-tumor immunity for cancer immunotherapy.
Cancer immunotherapy using nanoparticle vaccines (nanovaccines) is an emerging area with 
recent advances focusing on the co-delivery of antigens and adjuvants3,4. Spatio-temporal 
control of antigen transport to the secondary lymphoid organs, cytosolic delivery and cross-
presentation in the APCs in coordination with innate stimulation is essential to achieve 
robust tumor-specific T cell response. Although nanoparticles (<50 nm in diameter) can 
selectively accumulate inside the lymph nodes4,5, few studies had shown their ability to 
simultaneously promote antigen presentation and stimulate innate immune response without 
incorporation of adjuvants (e.g., CpG, Poly(I:C)). Recently, our lab has developed a library 
of ultra-pH sensitive (UPS) nanoparticles (20–50 nm in diameter) that are finely tunable in a 
broad range of physiological pH (4-7.4)6. Once taken up by cells, these nanoparticles can 
buffer the luminal pH of endocytic organelles at specific pH values7. Inspired by “proton 
sponge” polymers for cytosolic delivery of biologics8 and small nanoparticle size for lymph 
node targeting, we performed an in vivo screening of UPS nanoparticles to evaluate their 
abilities in generating cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. The UPS library consists of 
copolymers containing tertiary amines with linear or cyclic side chains (Fig. 1a and 
Supplementary Fig. 1). Ovalbumin (OVA) was used as a model antigen. OVA loading 
efficiency was measured to be >75% across different polymer nanoparticles (Supplementary 
Fig. 2).
OVA-specific CTL response was quantified by an in vivo CTL assay (Fig. 1a). Results show 
that PC7A NP allowed the highest OVA-specific splenocyte killings (82%) (Fig. 1b). PC7A 
NP yielded approximately two-fold stronger CTL response over PC6S1A or PEPA NPs with 
comparable pKa’s (6.9–7.0). In the linear amine series, PEPA had the highest CTL response. 
These data suggest that both transition pH (i.e., 6.9 that targets early endosomal pH) and 
polymer architecture (i.e., cyclic seven-membered ring of PC7A) are important to induce 
strong CTL response. Conventional PEG-b-poly(D, L-lactic acid) (PEG-PLA) micelles had 
a weak response (4.2%)9. OVA-PC7A NP induced approximately 20-fold higher CTL 
response over OVA-Alum (4.3%) or OVA-LPS that stimulates the TLR4 pathway (3.7%) 10, 
and 3.6-fold higher than OVA-CpG that stimulates the TLR9 pathway (23%)11. OVA-

 specific antibody responses from the sera of immunized mice showed that mice vaccinated 
with PC7A NP generated similar titers of OVA-specific IgG1 response comparable to those 
by Alum or LPS (Fig. 1c). PC7A NP also generated similar titers of OVA-specific IgG2c 
antibody to those immunized with OVA plus CpG or LPS (Fig. 1d). Altogether, we conclude 
that PC7A NP was able to induce a robust antigen-specific CTL, Th1 and Th2 responses 
with comparable or better efficacy than several established adjuvants.
To image nanoparticle transport into draining lymph nodes (dLNs), we labeled PC7A 
copolymer with indocyanine green and quantified PC7A NP (29 nm in diameter) 
biodistribution after subcutaneous injection at the tail base. Results show efficient 
accumulation of PC7A NP in the peripheral lymph nodes at 24 h (Supplementary Figure 3a). 
Other organs did not show significant accumulation. To investigate the ability of PC7A NP 
for antigen delivery, we first verified that OVA can be encapsulated in the PC7A NP by 
strong FRET effect, and the encapsulation was relatively stable in 5% serum over 24 h 
(Supplementary Fig. 2). We then used Alexa Fluor 647-labelled OVA with and without 
PC7A NP encapsulation and harvested the dLNs 24 h after subcutaneous injection. Flow 
cytometry quantified the percentage of OVA-positive cells in CD8α+ and CD8α− dendritic 
cells (DCs) and macrophages. All three cell populations showed a significantly higher OVA 
accumulation by PC7A-mediated delivery over OVA alone (Fig. 2a). LN-resident CD8α+ 
DC cells were known to be important for induction of CTL response12. The amount of OVA-
positive CD8α+ DCs increased 29 folds in OVA-PC7A NP group over the OVA only control.
We investigated the ability of PC7A NP on cytosolic delivery and cross-presentation of 
antigens13. Incubation of OVA-PC7A NP with bone marrow derived dendritic cells 
(BMDCs) showed similar amount of antigen uptake compared to OVA-PD5A NP and less 
than the OVA only group (Fig. 2c). In contrast, OVA peptide (SIINFEKL)-MHC-I complex 
had 3-fold increase in antigen cross-presentation by PC7A NP over the two control groups 
(Fig. 2d). Using an in vitro OT-I CD8+ T cell priming assay, BMDCs treated with OVA-
PC7A NP dramatically increased the IFN-γ secretion of CD8+ T cells isolated from OT-I 
mice over the other control groups (Fig. 2e). This result was further supported by in vivo 
CD8+ T cell priming assay, where OVA epitope (SIINFEKL) specific CD8+ T cells showed 
15-fold higher proliferation in OVA-PC7A NP group over OVA only group (Fig. 2f, g). 
Endosomal disruption for cytosolic delivery was first indicated by a hemolysis assay in red 
blood cells (RBCs) at different pH values14. Results showed that PC7A NP had no 
hemolytic effect at pH 7.4 but induced strong hemolysis (~90%) at pH below 7.0 upon 
micelle dissociation. PD5A NP did not show any observable RBC hemolysis in the same pH 
range (Supplementary Figure 4a–b). PC7A NP was able to deliver increased amount of 
redox-activatable dye-labelled OVA into the cell cytosol compared to the PD5A NP control 
by confocal microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 4c)15.
Costimulatory signals (e.g., CD80/86) and cytokines are also necessary to induce a strong 
tumor-specific CTL response16. At 24 h post immunization with OVA-PC7A NP, inguinal 
LNs increased in size compared to OVA alone (Supplementary Fig. 3b). The total cell 
number in the inguinal LNs from OVA-PC7A NP-treated mice increased by >2 folds over 
the controls (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Flow cytometry analysis showed significantly higher 
expressions of CD86 in different subgroups of APCs from mice treated by OVA-PC7A NP

 over three other control groups (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3d). Type I IFNs have been 
shown to boost the effectiveness of the CD8+ T cell response 17,18. We examined the 
expressions of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the local tissues19 over time after 
subcutaneous injection of PC7A NP. Poly(I:C) was used as a positive control20. Poly(I:C) 
was able to elicit higher response in IRF7 and CXCL10 expressions from 2 to 8 h than 
PC7A NP. At 24 h, PC7A NP produced stronger responses than the Poly(I:C) or PD5A NP 
group (Fig. 3b–c).
To validate the effect of type I IFN pathway on CTL response, we measured the OVA-
specific CTL and Th1 response in IFN receptor (IFN-α/βR−/−) knockout mice. Data show 
majority of the CTL/Th1 response was abolished in IFN-α/βR−/− mice compared to wild 
type control (Fig. 3d–f), consistent with the ISG expression data. Toll-like receptors (TLR), 
MAVS and STING are known to activate the type I interferon pathways17,21. Immune 
response in MyD88−/−/TRIF−/−, MAVS−/− or STINGgt/gt mice showed that T cell response 
was not dependent on TLR or MAVS, whereas STINGgt/gt mice almost recapitulated the 
phenotypes in IFN-α/βR−/− mice (Fig. 3d–f). Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) can sense 
cytosolic DNA and produce cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which subsequently activates 
STING, leading to induction of type I IFNs22. Additional studies in cGAS−/− mice showed 
CTL response was partially dependent on cGAS. The roles of STING and cGAS in ISG 
induction were further confirmed by in vitro cell culture data using bone marrow derived 
macrophages (BMDMs) and human monocyte THP-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5a–b). To 
evaluate the role of cytosolic DNA in cGAS-dependent STING activation, we transfected 
DNase I into BMDMs before PC7A treatment23. The PC7A-induced ISG level in wildtype 
BMDMs decreased to almost the same level as in cGAS−/− BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 
5c). For cGAS-independent STING activation, we performed a STING pulldown assay 
using biotin-conjugated PC7A NP incubated with THP-1 cells. Results show that only 
PC7A-biotin was able to retain STING but not PD5A-biotin and PC7A-only (biotin free) 
controls (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Further pulldown of purified C-terminal domain (CTD, 
139-397 AAs) of STING (Supplementary Fig. 5e) suggests direct binding between STING 
and PC7A. Isothermal calorimetry analysis showed a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.3 μM 
(Supplementary Fig. 5f–g). This interaction is weaker compared to cGAMP binding to 
STING (Kd =9.6 nM). Negligible binding was found between PC7A and bovine serum 
albumin in the negative control. Despite such evidence of a specific interaction between 
PC7A and STING, further structural and functional studies are required to determine if 
PC7A can activate STING through direct binding.
To identify which cell populations are responsible for nanoparticle uptake and STING 
activation, Cy5-labeled PC7A polymer was employed to quantify NP uptake and 
phosphorylated IRF3 (pIRF3) was used to detect the activation of STING-type I IFN 
pathway24. Flow cytometry analysis showed that in LNs 24 h post injection, NP+ cells had 
significantly elevated pIRF3 expressions over NP− cells (Supplementary Fig. 6a). 
Furthermore, 87% of NP+ cells expressed a DC cell marker (CD11c+) as corroborated by 
MHC-II+ expression (Supplementary Fig. 6b). The same analysis was performed on cell 
suspensions from the injection site (Supplementary Fig. 6c). Data show CD45+ leukocytes 
internalized significantly higher amount of PC7A NPs than CD45− cells. In the CD45− 
cells, we did not observe any significant increase in the pIRF3 levels. In the CD45+ cells,

 significantly elevated pIRF3 levels were found in the NP+ cells over NP− cells. About 95% 
of CD45+NP+ cells had CD11c+ expressions (lower panel in Supplementary Fig. 6d). These 
data illustrate APCs especially DCs were the major cell population that took up PC7A NPs 
and subsequently activated STING-type I IFN pathway.
STING activation has been reported to induce immune regulatory responses such as elevated 
expressions of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1)25. We compared the IDO-1 and 
CXCL10 expression profiles treated with the whole panel of nanoparticles. Results show 
that the lack of CTL activity by nanoparticles other than PC7A NP is not a result of elevated 
IDO-1 expression but rather due to the lack of STING activation (Supplementary Fig. 5i–j). 
IDO enzyme activity in mice treated with subcutaneous injections of selected polymers 
(PC7A, PD5A or PEPA NP, 150 μg, 5-fold of vaccine dose) showed no statistical 
significance (Supplementary Fig. 5h). The elevated IDO expression by PC7A NP may 
warrant future studies of potential immune checkpoint effect following T cell activation.
Based on the above characteristics (Fig. 4a), we investigated the antitumor efficacy of PC7A 
nanovaccine in several tumor models. In the B16-OVA melanoma model, a physical mixture 
of an antigenic peptide (OVA257-280, 0.5 μg) with PC7A NP (30 μg) was formulated. 
Different nanovaccine groups were subcutaneously injected 5 days after tumor inoculation, 
followed by a booster shot 5 days later (Fig. 4b). In the PBS control group, all the animals 
died in 20 days. OVA257-280 alone, PC7A NP alone or OVA257-280-PD5A NP groups did not 
offer any significant tumor growth inhibition or survival benefit over the PBS control 
(Supplementary Fig. 7a–b). OVA257-280-CpG and OVA257-280-Poly(I:C) groups conferred a 
minor degree of immune protection (Fig. 4b–c). In contrast, OVA257-280-PC7A NP achieved 
the maximum therapeutic efficacy, where 50% of animals survived over 40 days. In B16-F10 
melanoma, we used a cocktail of either tumor associated antigens (Gp10021-41, Trp1214-237, 
Trp2173-196) or neoantigens (Obsl1T1764M, Kif18bK739N, Def8R255G)26 in PC7A NP (0.5 μg 
for each peptide, 30 μg polymer). PC7A vaccination significantly slowed the growth of 
B16F10 tumors over antigen only, PC7A only and non-treated controls (Fig. 4d and 
Supplementary Fig. 7c). In the colon cancer MC38 model, we selected three tumor 
neoantigens (Reps1P45A, AdpgkR304M, Dpagt1V213L)27. Data also show significantly 
improved tumor growth inhibition (Fig. 4e). Finally, we employed human papilloma virus 
(HPV) E6/7 TC-1 tumors28,29. Using an E7-derived peptide E743-62, 50% of mice are tumor 
free 60 days after treatment with E743-62-PC7A NP (Fig. 4f–g and Supplementary Fig. 8e). 
Combination of PC7A nanovaccine with an anti-PD-1 antibody showed synergy in both 
B16-OVA melanoma and TC-1 tumor models (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 8). In the 
TC-1 model, 100% of the animals survived for over 60 days and 90% animals were tumor 
free (Supplementary Fig. 8e). Both B16OVA and TC-1 tumor models showed mild PD-L1 
expressions on tumor cells while certain subtype of myeloid cells had high PD-L1 
expressions over the isotype control (Supplementary Fig. 8d, f). These data support the 
nanovaccine synergy with anti-PD1 therapy. Meanwhile, anti-PD-1 therapy alone did not 
lead to significantly improved antitumor effect in either model similar to other reports30,31. 
Tumor-free mice were rechallenged with 1×106 TC-1 tumor cells 82 days after tumor 
inoculation. Data show that previously treated, tumor-free mice were resistant to the newly 
inoculated tumor cells whereas such tumors grew robustly in naïve mice and surgically 
cured mice (Supplementary Figure 7e). These results suggest a long-term antitumor

 response induced by the nanovaccine, which likely activate memory T cells. Analyses of 
systemic cytokines/chemokines of mice treated with PC7A NP (150 μg, 5-fold of vaccine 
dose) showed much less systemic cytokine levels compared to Poly(I:C) control 
(Supplementary Figure 9). Histology analysis of major organs (e.g., liver, spleen, kidney, 
heart) did not show any observable toxicity in mice treated with repeated injections of PC7A 
nanovaccine (150 μg, 5-fold of vaccine dose, Supplementary Figure 10). These data 
demonstrate the safe and efficacious antitumor immunity of PC7A nanovaccine at a small 
antigen dose (0.5 μg) and its notable synergy with a checkpoint inhibitor.
In summary, we discovered a synthetic nanoparticle that not only enhances antigen delivery 
and cross-presentation but also stimulates the STING pathway to boost antitumor immunity 
for cancer immunotherapy. The simplicity, robust T cell activation and synergy with 
checkpoint inhibition make the PC7A nanovaccine an attractive candidate for clinical 
development. This nanovaccine platform can be rapidly adopted to incorporate many 
existing tumor-associated antigens as well as a growing number of tumor neoantigens32,33. 
The unique characteristics of PC7A NP also allow it to package microbial antigens as 
vaccines for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.

Syntheses of PEG-b-PR block copolymers
PEG-b-PR copolymers were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) 
following procedures previously reported36. PEG-b-PDPA is used as an example to illustrate 
the procedure. First, DPA-MA (7 mmol), PMDETA (0.1 mmol), and MeO-PEG114-Br (0.1 
mmol) were dissolved in 2-propanol (2 mL) and DMF (2 mL). After three cycles of freeze-
pump-thaw, CuBr (0.1 mmol) was added. The polymerization was carried out at 40 °C for 
10 hours. The reaction mixture was passed through a neutral Al2O3 column, the residue was 
dialyzed in distilled water and lyophilized. The obtained polymers were characterized by 1H 
NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC).
Syntheses of PEG-b-(PR-r-Dye) block copolymers
AMA-MA was introduced in the PEG-b-PR copolymers for the conjugation of dyes 
followed the similar procedure34,35. After synthesis, PEG-b-(PR-r-AMA) (10 mg) and Dye-
NHS (1.5 equivalences) was both dissolved in DMF. After overnight reaction, the 
copolymers were purified by preparative GPC.
Preparation of nanoparticles
Micelles were prepared following a solvent evaporation method35. In the example of PEG-b-
PC7A, copolymer was dissolved in methanol and then added into distilled water under 
sonication. Methanol was removed using ultrafiltration tube (MW = 100 KD). The

 nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS, Malvern MicroV model, 
He-Ne laser, λ= 632 nm) for hydrodynamic diameter (Dh).
OVA loading and stability studies
OVA loading efficiency inside nanoparticles was measured by an ultrafiltration method. 
Briefly, nanoparticles (300 μg/mL) were mixed with AF647-labelled OVA (100 μg/mL) for 
30 min. Free OVA was removed by ultrafiltration tube with a molecular weight cutoff of 100 
kD. The concentration of free OVA was measured on a Hitachi fluorometer (F-7500 model) 
with excitation wavelength at 640 nm. The loading efficiency was calculated using the 
equation below:
To evaluate the loading stability, OVA-loaded PC7A nanoparticles were incubated in PBS 
buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5% fetal bovine serum over different times. Free OVA was 
separated and determined as described above.
The FRET experiment was further designed to investigate the polymer and OVA 
interactions. Typically, Cy3.5-conjugated PC7A (100 μg/mL) was incubated with AF647-
labelled OVA (20ug/mL) in PBS buffer (pH = 7.4). After 30 min incubation, the 
fluorescence emission spectra were obtained on a Hitachi fluorometer (F-7500 model). The 
samples were excited at 590 nm, and the emission spectra were collected from 600 to 750 
nm.
Animals and cells
All animal procedures were performed with ethical compliance and approval by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern 
Medical Center. Female C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks) were obtained from the UT 
southwestern breeding core. INF-α/βR−/−mice were kindly provided by Dr. David Farrar

 In vivo cytotoxicity killing assay
Groups of C57BL/6 mice were injected (OVA 10 μg plus nanoparticles 30 μg or other 
adjuvants with the same dose) subcutaneously at the tail base of C57BL/6 mice. Imject 
Alum (4 mg per mouse, 50μl:50μl mixture with the antigen solution) was used by volume 
ratio as recommended by manufacture. One week later, naïve C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed 
and spleenocytes were collected. Half of the spleenocytes were pulsed with OVA257-263 or 
E749-57 peptides for 2 h in complete media at 37 °C. The unpulsed and peptide-pulsed cells 
were labeled with 0.5 or 0.05 μM Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), 
respectively, in serum free media for 15 mins. Equal numbers (1×107) of CFSElow (OVA 
pulsed cells) and CFSEhigh (unpulsed cells) were mixed together and injected intravenously 
into the immunized mice. After 16 h, the blood from treated mice was collected and 
subjected to flow cytometry analysis. The number of CFSEhigh and CFSElow was determined 
and used to calculate the percentage of OVA peptide-pulsed target cell killing. Specific 
killing was defined as percentage of specific lysis = [1−non-transferred control ratio/
experimental ratio] x100.
ELISA assay
For antibody detection, groups of C57BL/6 mice were immunized with different vaccines on 
day 0 and 14. On day 21, 50 μL of blood was drawn from tail vein and the antigen-specific 
IgG1 and IgG2c in serum were measured by ELISA. For ELISA assay, flat-bottomed 96-
well plates (Nunc, Rochester, NY) were precoated with OVA protein at a concentration of 
0.5 μg protein/well in 50 mM carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at 4 °C overnight, which were then 
blocked with 5% Glycine. Antisera obtained from immunized animals were serially diluted 
from 102 to 106 in PBS-0.05% Tween (PBS-T), pH 7.4, and were added to the wells and 
incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Goat anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2c (HRP) (Abcam, Cambridge, 
MA) were used at a dilution of 1:10,000 in PBS-T–1% BSA for labeling. After adding the 
HRP substrates, optical densities were determined at a wavelength of 450 nm in an ELISA 
plate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Lymph node imaging assay
To investigate whether NP can accumulate in the draining lymph nodes, we labeled the 
PC7A copolymer with indocyanine green (ICG, λex/λem = 800/820 nm). ICG-encoded 
PC7A NP (30 μg per mice) was injected subcutaneously at the tail base of C57BL/6 mice. 
NP distribution was imaged using a clinical camera (SPY Elite®). Animals were sacrificed 
at 24h after injection of NP, major organs and inguinal and axillary LNs were excised and 
imaged.
In vivo cell uptake assay
For antigen delivery assay, subcutaneous injections at tail base of C57BL/6 mice were 
performed with PBS alone, OVA-AF647, or nanoparticle plus OVA-AF647 treatments. At 24 
h post injection, mice were sacrificed and inguinal lymph nodes were removed, teased with 
26 gauge needles and then passed through a 70-μm cell strainer (BD) to recover a cell 
suspension. The lymph node cell suspension was stained with PI and anti-CD11c-FITC, 
anti-CD11b-pacific blue, anti-B220-APC-Cy7, anti-CD8a-PE-Cy7. Four major APCs

 populations (CD8α+DC cells (CD11c+CD11b−B220−CD8α+), CD8α−DC cells (CD11c+ 
CD8α−), macrophage cells (CD11b+ CD11c− B220−), B cells (B220+ CD11c−)) were 
analyzed for the OVA-AF647 positive cells. APC maturation was measured by staining with 
anti-CD86-PE.
For nanoparticle uptake and STING activation assay, subcutaneous injections at tail base of 
C57BL/6 mice were carried out with PBS alone, or PC7A-Cy5 (30 μg) treatments. At 24 h 
post injection, mice were sacrificed, inguinal lymph nodes and subcutaneous tissue were 
removed, and digested in collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 25 mins at 37°C. 
Tissue was then passed through a 70-μm cell strainer (BD) to recover a cell suspension. All 
the cell suspension were stained with PI and anti-CD11c-FITC, anti-MHCII-BV605, anti-
CD45.2-Apc-Cy7. For intracellular pIRF3 staining, cells were permeabilized by the 
Fixation/Permeabilization kit (BD Cat#554714). After blocking with mouse serum, cells 
were stained with pIRF3 antibody (Cell Signaling, Cat # 4947) and subsequently were 
stained with anti-rabbit IgG-PE secondary antibody (Biolegend). Flow cytometry (LSRII, 
BD) was performed on stained cell suspensions and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree 
Star Inc. Ashland, OR).
In vitro cell uptake and cross presentation assay
Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were generated by culturing bone marrow cells flushed 
from femurs of C57BL/6J mice in DC media: DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, pen/
strep, sodium pyruvate and 20 ng/mL GM-CSF. Media was half replaced every 2 days; non-
adherent and loosely adherent immature dendritic cells (DCs) were collected on day 6 and 
phenotyped by determining expression of CD11c (routinely 60–80% CD11c+). OVA-AF647 
(2ug/mL) or mixture of OVA-AF647 with different nanoparticles (50 μg/mL) was incubated 
with murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) at 37°C for 4 hours and 
quantified using the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cells by FACS. For cross 
presentation assay, BMDCs were incubated with OVA alone or mixture of OVA with 
different nanoparticles at 37°C for 18–20 hours, then the OVA257-267 presented on the MHC-
I on cell surface were detected by monoclonal antibody 25mAb-D1.16, an antibody 
specifically recognize OVA peptide SIINFEKL bound to H-2Kb.
In vitro CD8+ T cell priming assay
To evaluate antigen presentation by OVA-NP-pulsed BMDCs, IFN-γ secretion by primed 
OT-I T cells was used to quantify CD8+ T-cell activation. Briefly, BMDCs were incubated 
with 3 μg/mL OVA alone or mixture of OVA with different nanoparticles (50 μg/mL) at 
37°C for 18 h. CD8+ T lymphocytes from OT-I mice were selected by magnetic separation 
(MACS system; Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the 
manufacturer’s indications. The purity of CD8+ T lymphocytes was >95%. CD8+ T cells 
were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 96-well plates (Costar; Corning, Inc., Corning, NY) in 
RPMI media containing 10% FCS and 2 × 105 unpulsed, or antigen-pulsed BMDCs that 
were added for 24 h. Cell culture supernatants were collected and analyzed for cytokine 
content using mouse TH1/TH2 9-Plex Ultra-sensitive Kit (Meso Scale Discovery). Samples 
were run in triplicate.

 In vivo CD8+ T cell priming assay
Spleens were harvested from B6 CD45.2+ OT-I mice, CD8+ T cells from cell suspensions 
were isolated by magnetic bead separation on a MACS column. 5 × 104 OT-1 CD8+ T cells 
were transferred into B6 CD45.1+ mice via intravenous (i.v.) injection and allowed to 
acclimate for 1 day prior to immunization. 1 day later, groups of CD45.1+ mice were 
immunized with PBS alone, OVA(10 μg), or nanoparticle (30 μg) plus OVA subcutaneously 
at the tail base. One week later, spleens were harvested and dispersed into single-cell 
suspensions, stained with anti-CD8-PE-cy7, APC-conjugated H-2Kb/OVA (SIINFEKL) 
tetramer (NIH) for flow cytometry analysis.
Hemolysis assay
The capacity of polymers to promote pH-dependent disruption of lipid bilayer membranes 
was assessed via a red blood cell hemolysis assay as previously described14. Polymers were 
incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of mouse erythrocytes at 20 μg/mL in 100 mM 
sodium phosphate buffer (supplemented with 150 mM NaCl) in the pH range of the 
endosomal processing pathway (7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.8, 6.6, and 6.4). The extent of cell lysis (i.e. 
hemolytic activity) was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the amount of 
hemoglobin released (A541 nm). Hemolytic activity was normalized to a 100% lysis control 
(1% Triton X-100 treated red blood cells). Samples were run in triplicate.
Flow cytometry
Antibodies were purchased from Biolegend. The following primary antibodies were used: 
anti-CD16/CD32 (Biolegend, Cat#: 101301, clone: 93), anti-CD8-PE-cy7 (Biolegend, Cat#: 
100721, clone: 53-6.7), anti-CD11c-FITC (Biolegend, Cat#: 117305, clone: N418) and anti-
CD11b-Pacif blue (Biolegend, Cat#: 101223, clone: M1/70), anti-B220-APC-cy7 
(Biolegend, Cat#: 103223, clone: RA3-6B2), anti-CD86-PE (Biolegend, Cat#: 105007, 
clone: GL-1), anti- H-2Kb bound to SIINFEKL-APC (Biolegend, Cat#:141605, clone:25-
D1.16), anti-CD45.2-APC (Biolegend, Cat#:109814, clone:104), anti-CD45.2-APCcy7 
(Biolegend, Cat#:109823, clone:104), anti-PD-L1-PE (Biolegend, Cat#:124307, clone:10F.
9G2), isotype control-PE (Biolegend, Cat#:400607, clone:RTK4530), anti-F4/80-PE/cy7 
(Biolegend, Cat#:123113, clone:BM8), anti-Gr-1-FITC (Biolegend, Cat#:108419, 
clone:RB608C5), anti-MHCII-BV605 (Biolegend, Cat#:107639, clone:M5/114.15.2), anti-
rabbit IgG-PE (Biolegend, Cat#:406421, clone:poly4064). Flow data were acquired on a 
BD™ LSR II flow cytometer and analyzed using Flowjo software.
RT-PCR
Subcutaneous tissues were taken at indicated time points after injection with OVA-PC7A NP 
(OVA 10 μg, PC7A 150 μg) or the same dose of different adjuvants. To obtain BMDM, 
about 1 × 107 bone marrow cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, antibiotics 
and conditioned media from L929 cell culture. After 6 to 7 days, mature macrophages were 
harvested and cultured on 12-well plates for experiments5. Total RNAs were extracted by 
TRIzol (Invitrogen) from cells or tissues according to the manufacturer’s instructions. q-RT-
PCR were performed as previously described37,38. Samples were run in triplicate. The 
following primers were used for q-RT-PCR.

DNase I transfection
BMDMs were transfected with 5 μg of DNase I (Roche) by transfection reagent DOTAP 
(Roche) according to manufacturer’s instructions. After incubating the cells with DOTAP-
DNase I or DOTAP alone for 1hr, cells were washed to remove excess of transfection 
reagent and enzyme and were then incubated with PC7A at 400 μg/ml for 9 hr. CXCL10 
were measured by RT-PCR.
STING pulldown assay
To investigate the STING interaction with PC7A copolymer, we labeled the PC7A 
copolymer with biotin (2–3 biotins per polymer chain). For THP-1 cell pulldown assay, 
PC7A-biotin (200 μg/ml) was incubated with THP-1 cells for 8 hrs, and then cells were 
collected and lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma R0278). Lysates were precipitated with 
streptavidin-modified dynabeads (BD 557812). Samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE 
and Western blots by rabbit anti-STING antibody (Cell Signaling, Cat # 13647). For STING 
protein pull down assay, human STING CTD (139–379) expression and purification had 
been described before39, PC7A-biotin(50 μg/mL) was incubated with STING CTD(1 μg/ml) 
for 3hrs in PBS (pH=6.8), PEPA-biotin in PBS (pH=6.8) and PD5A-biotin in PBS (pH=4.4) 
with the same concentration were used as control groups, and then precipitated with 
streptavidin-modified dynabeads. Samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western 
blots.
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
ITC was employed to measure the binding affinities between STING CTD and PC7A 
polymers or cGAMP using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (GE Healthcare), ITC of PC7A-
bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a negative control. The titrations were performed 
at 20 °C in the buffer containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 6.8), 150 mM NaCl. Thirty-two 
injections were performed with 4 min spacing time. The titration traces were integrated by 
NITPIC, and then the curves were fitted by SEDFIT.39 The figures were prepared using 
GUSSI (http://biophysics.swmed.edu/MBR/software.html).

 IDO enzyme activity assay in tissues
Bacterial pDNA (pEGFPN1, Clontech) was prepared using an endotoxin-free Kit (Qiagen). 
Mice were intravenously injected with 30 μg pDNA mixed with in vivo-jetPEI (Polyplus -
transfection, N:P =8) or were injected s.c. with NPs (150 μg, 5-fold of vaccine dose). IDO 
activity was measured as described in previous reports40,41. Enzyme activity was expressed 
as the product content per hour per gram of tissue protein.
Immunization and tumor therapy experiments
Six to eight week old mice (n=10 for each group) were injected subcutaneously with B16-
OVA or B16F10 melanoma cells(1.5 × 105), or TC-1 cells(1.5 × 105), MC38 cells(5 × 105) 
into the right flank of mice. Animals were immunized with subcutaneous injection at the tail 
base of antigen-polymer NP (0.5 μg per antigen peptide, PC7A NP 30 μg) or the same dose 
of different adjuvants as described in the main text. Or at day 3, 6, 9 and 12, some groups 
were i.p. injected with 200 μg checkpoint inhibitors (anti-mPD-1, BioXcell, BE0146) for 
comparison or synergy evaluation. The tumor growth was subsequently measured twice a 
week using a digital caliper and calculated as 0.5×length × width2 by blinded investigators. 
Mice were killed when tumor surface area reached 1500mm3, the end point of tumor 
detection is 2 fold of the longest survival time (LST) of control group, so around 40 days for 
melanoma tumor model, and around 60 days for TC-1 and MC38 tumor models.
For PD-L1 expression analyses, tumor tissues were digested by 1 mg/mL collagenase IV 
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2 mg/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 minutes at 37°C. Cells 
were then stained with antibodies against PD-L1, CD11b, Gr-1, F4/80, CD11c, and CD45 
(Biolegend).
Statistical analysis
Based on pilot immunization and tumor treatment studies, we used group sizes of 3–6 
animals/group for immunogenicity measurements and 10 animals/group for tumor therapy 
experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and Prism 5.0 
(GraphPad). Data are expressed as means ± s.e.m. Data were analyzed by Student’s t test. 
Variance similarity test (f-test) was performed before t-test. All t-tests were one-tailed and 
unpaired, and were considered statistically significant if p< 0.05, (*, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; 
***, p<0.001 unless otherwise indicated). The survival rates of the two groups were 
analyzed using a log-rank test and were considered statistically significant if p< 0.05.
