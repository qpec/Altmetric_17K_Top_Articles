Abstract
Background: Firearm injuries disproportionately affect young, male, non-White populations, causing substantial
individual and societal burden. Annual costs for hospitalized firearm injuries have not been widely described, as
most previous cost studies have focused on lifetime costs. We examined a nationally-representative database of
hospitalizations in the US to estimate per-hospital and overall hospital costs for firearm injuries by intent, type of
weapon, and payer source.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all firearm injury hospitalizations in the National Inpatient
Sample from 2003 through 2013. The National Inpatient Sample, maintained by the Healthcare Utilization Project, is
a stratified and weighted national sample of more than 20% of all hospitals. All admissions for firearm injuries were
identified through Ecodes, yielding a weighted total of 336,785 for the study period. Average annual per-patient
and overall hospital costs were estimated using generalized linear modelling, controlling for patient and hospital
variables. Costs by intent, firearm type, and payer sources were estimated.
Results: Annually from 2003 through 2013, 30,617 hospital admissions were for firearm injuries, for an annual rate
of 10.1 admissions per 100,000 US population. More than 80% of hospitalizations were among individuals
aged 15–44, and rates were nine times higher for males than females and nearly ten times higher for the
Black than the White population. More than 60% of admissions were for assaults, and 70% of the injuries that
had a known firearm type were from handguns. The average annual admission cost was $622 million. The
highest per-admission costs were for injuries from assault weapons ($32,237 per admission) and for legal
intervention ($33,462 per admission), but the highest total costs were for unspecific firearm type ($373 million) and
assaults ($389 million). A quarter of firearm injury hospitalizations were among the uninsured, yielding average annual
total costs of $155 million.
Conclusion: Hospitals can project that government insurance will be the highest source for firearm injury
reimbursement, and depending on healthcare access laws, that many of their firearm injury admissions will
not be covered by insurance.

 Background
Among all injury deaths in the United States in 2015,
17% were caused by a firearm (National Center for
Injury Prevention and Control & US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2015; Karp, 2011). Among
youth aged 15–24 this percent increased to 29.6%, and
for Black youth firearms were the leading overall cause
of death, resulting in 58.6% of all injury deaths. Individ-
ual firearm ownership is high but not unique to the
United States, although the burden of firearm violence
is: World Health Organization mortality data from 2010
indicate that US gun-related homicide rates were 25
times higher than in a comparison group of 23 high in-
come countries (Cook & Ludwig, 1997; Council on Injury,
Violence, and Poison Prevention Executive Committee &
American Academy of Pediatrics, 2012; Grinshteyn &
Hemenway, 2016). While the majority of research has
been on firearm deaths, the individual, family, and com-
munity burden is also high for those with non-fatal fire-
arm injuries.
Research to reduce the health and societal burden of
firearm injuries has been lacking, and medical and public
health groups have published calls to build an evidence
base for prevention (Karp, 2011; Branas et al., 2017;
Strong et al., 2016). Understanding the economic burden
of firearm injuries is a critical element of advancing our
knowledge base. Of seven studies reporting the cost bur-
den of firearm injuries (Salemi et al., 2015; Spitzer et al.,
2017; Corso et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2014; Miller, 2012;
Fowler et al., 2015; Allareddy et al., 2012), two have esti-
mated hospitalization costs for firearm injuries in the US
population (Salemi et al., 2015; Spitzer et al., 2017).
Salemi et al. (2015) estimated annual hospitalization
costs at $679 million and reported hospitalization costs
by patient and hospital (Salemi et al., 2015). Spitzer et al.
(2017) estimated total hospitalization costs for the
period of 2006–2014 at $6.6 billion and reported costs
by payer source (Spitzer et al., 2017). Neither of these
studies conducted multivariable analysis to examine cost
components from firearm injuries. Of the other firearm
cost studies, three focused on the overall lifetime costs
associated with firearm deaths and injuries (Corso et al.,
2007; Lee et al., 2014; Miller, 2012), one focused on life-
time medical costs and productivity loss (Fowler et al.,
2015), and one that examined hospital costs included
only children (Allareddy et al., 2012).
The aim of this study was to estimate annual and per-
hospitalization
cost
for
firearm
injuries
by
intent,
weapon type, and payer source, controlling for patient
and hospital characteristics. We examined data from the
National Inpatient Sample from 2003 through 2013. The
healthcare industry will benefit from information about
the annual direct medical costs associated with firearm
injuries and the main contributors to these costs, as this
information can be used to anticipate costs and to com-
pare to a national benchmark. Information about patient
characteristics, injury intent, type of weapon, and payer
source will alsobe helpful, but these relationships have
not been examined routinely in previous studies. These
data will also be helpful to those planning intervention
programs by bringing more attention to the economic
burden of firearm injuries in the US.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study included patients admit-
ted to the hospital for a firearm injury, identified
through
the
National
Inpatient
Sample from
2003
through 2013. The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) is
maintained
by
the
Health
Care
Utilization
Project
(HCUP) and is the largest all-payer inpatient care data-
base in the United States (Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality, 2012). Prior to 2012, the NIS
approximated a 20% stratified sample of hospitals; begin-
ning in 2012, the NIS is comprised of a stratified sample
of discharges from all hospitals participating in HCUP.
Our analyses incorporated sampling weights appropriate
for each year in the study period.
We identified firearm injuries through External Cause
of Injury Codes (Ecode 922.0–985.4). The NIS database
provides four variables populated with Ecodes, and a
firearm code in any of these four variables was included
in the sample. Approximately 15% of NIS patient files
that have an injury diagnosis are missing an Ecode, and
thus we investigated the potential for firearm injuries to
be entered without an Ecode (Greenspan et al., 2006).
We first identified cases with an ICD-9 Injury Diagnosis
Code (ICD 800–999) that had all Ecode variables miss-
ing. We then compared the distribution of primary in-
jury diagnoses among injury cases missing an Ecode
with those identified as firearm injuries. The most com-
mon overlapping diagnosis codes were open abdominal
wounds (1.1% of firearm injuries vs. 0.02% of non-Ecode
injuries) and open brain injury with deep coma (1.1% of
firearm injuries vs. 0.002% of non-Ecode injuries). Based
on the lack of overlap in injury diagnosis distributions
overall, and the very small proportion of both samples
with overlapping diagnoses, we concluded that firearm
injuries are infrequently missing Ecodes in the NIS data.
Firearm injuries were characterized through Ecodes by
intent (unintentional, self-harm, assault, legal interven-
tion/terrorism, and undetermined) and firearm type
(handgun, shotgun, hunting rifle, assault weapon, and
other/unspecified).
National population-based rates were calculated by
age, sex, and race, using US Census Data annual esti-
mates as the rate denominator. Since race was missing
on 17% of the retrospective sample, single imputation of
race was done using a baseline-category logit regression
Peek-Asa et al. Injury Epidemiology  (2017) 4:20 
Page 2 of 9
 using costs and patient and hospital level variables as
described above as predictors. Since the NIS codes
race and ethnicity differently than the Census, we re-
categorized the Census classifications of race and eth-
nicity to match that of NIS. Specifically, the Census
classifications of Not Hispanic White, Black, Ameri-
can Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Native Hawai-
ian Pacific Islander, and two or more races were
categorized as White, Black, Native American, Asian
or Pacific Islander, and other respectively to match
the NIS race classifications. Lastly, the Census His-
panic category was classified to match the NIS His-
panic race category.
The main outcome was hospital costs, which better re-
flect the actual costs for the hospitalization than the
hospital charges provided in the NIS dataset. Costs were
obtained by a conversion of charges using the cost-to-
charge ratios files provided by the NIS. These files con-
tain a multiplier specific to each hospital per year that is
applied to the patient-level charges. The NIS-provided
user-guides were followed in converting charges to costs
(https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/state/costtocharge.j-
sp#how). Costs were adjusted for inflation to Q4 of 2013
for inpatient hospital services based on the Bureau of
Labor Statistic’s Consumer Price Index.
We used multivariable modelling to estimate the asso-
ciation of patient-level costs by intent, firearm type and
payer source, controlling for covariates and hospital
characteristics. Covariates were chosen to minimize the
model QIC score and included sex, age, race, income,
hospital disposition (routine vs. other), died during
hospitalization, payer, hospital bed size, hospital region,
and year. Year was treated as a categorical variable be-
cause it did not have a linear trend. Variables such as
hospital length of stay and severity were not included
because they were intermediates and greatly increased
the QIC score. A generalized linear model (GLM) based
on the gamma distribution with a log link function was
found to best fit the data. The model was fit using gener-
alized estimating equations with an exchangeable work-
ing correlation matrix to account for data collected
longitudinally at each hospital. In the NIS, hospitals are
nested within each sampling stratum, yet the hospital
composition of each stratum may change from year to
year. NIS sampling weights were also incorporated into
the GLM to obtain national estimates. All analyses were
conducted using SAS, version 9.4. The univariable
summary statistics were compiled using the SURVEY-
FREQ procedure and the multivariable modeling re-
sults were obtained using the GENMOD procedure.
Cost estimates for intent, firearm type, and payer
source were obtained from the multivariable model
using the BYLEVEL option in conjunction with the
LSMEANS statement. As such, the model-based cost
estimates were adjusted for quantitative and qualita-
tive covariates by using observed means and observed
relative frequencies, respectively.
Results
Rate of firearm injury hospital admissions
A weighted total of 336,785 hospital admissions for fire-
arm admissions were identified from 2003 through 2013
in the NIS sample, for an annual average number of
30,617 and a rate of 10.1 admissions per 100,000 US
population (Table 1). More than 80% of hospitalizations
were among individuals aged 15–44, with the highest
annual rate of 28.9 per 100,000 among those aged
15–24 years. The rate of firearm injury for males
(18.2 per 100,000) was nine times higher than for fe-
males (2.1 per 100,000). Nearly half of all hospitalizations
were among the Black population, who experienced a rate
of 39.7 per 100,000. The race category of “other” had the
second highest rate of 21.1 per 100,000, and this group in-
cludes primarily people with multiple race and ethnicity
designations.
Annually, the trend in firearm injury rates did not dif-
fer substantially from 2003 to 2013. While slightly
decreasing from 10.01 in 2003 to 8.7 in 2013, the rate
fluctuated throughout the period, reaching a peak of
12.9 in 2010 (Fig. 1).
Demographic characteristics and payer source by firearm
injury intent
Overall, 60.6% of firearm injuries were assaults, 22.6%
were unintentional, and 8.6% were self-harm (Table 2).
Among children, firearm injuries of unintentional intent
were the most common, comprising 55.8% of firearm in-
juries to children aged five and younger and 42.4% of
those aged five to 14. From the ages of 15 through 64,
assault was the most common intent, followed by unin-
tentional injuries. The proportion of firearm injuries
caused by self-harm increased with age, reaching 38.8%
among those aged 65 and over. Among this age group,
32.8% of firearm injuries were unintentional. Although
assault was the most common intent for both males and
females, a higher proportion of males (61.5%) than fe-
males (52.8%) were due to assault.
The proportion of firearm injuries caused by assaults
was far higher for non-Whites than Whites, and was the
intent in more than 70% of all firearm injuries among
Blacks and Hispanics. Whites had the highest proportion
of unintentional (34.3%) and self-harm (24.3%) firearm
injuries.
About half of firearm hospital admissions among those
with private insurance were from assault, compared with
68.1% of those insured by Medicaid, 63.7% of those
without insurance. Firearm admissions among those in-
sured by Medicare had a very different distribution than
Peek-Asa et al. Injury Epidemiology  (2017) 4:20 
Page 3 of 9
 other payer sources, having the highest percentage of
unintentional (31.6%) and self-harm (30.2%) firearm in-
juries and the lowest percentage of assault injuries
(28.4%).
Demographic characteristics and payer source by type of
weapon
For 59.4% of firearm hospital admissions the type of
weapon was not known within the medical record
source (Table 3). Most of the injuries with a known
weapon type were caused by handguns, accounting for
31.2% of all injuries and 76.8% of injuries with a known
weapon type. Handguns comprised a higher proportion
of injuries among children five and under and elderly
age 65 and over. A higher proportion of females (35.0%)
than males (30.8%) were injured by handguns. Whites
and those in the ‘other’ race/ethnicity category had the
highest proportion of injuries from handguns. Medicare-
covered firearm injuries had the lowest proportion of
unknown weapon type (47.3%), and the highest propor-
tion of injuries from shotguns (8.7%) and rifles (4.3%).
Costs for firearm injury hospitalizations by intent, type of
weapon, and payer source
The average hospital admission costs for firearm injuries
exceeded $622 million per year, which represents a small
portion of overall firearm death and injury costs. Results

 per patient and total annual costs, controlling for age, race,
income, disposition, death during hospitalization, year, and
hospital bed size and region are presented in Table 4.
For admissions for which the type of firearm was
known, handguns accounted for over 70% of the costs,
which exceeded $183 million. This was the highest total
admission cost per known firearm type, although hand-
gun injuries were the least costly per admission. Assault
weapons, although the most expensive at over $32,000
per admission, had the lowest annual costs at $2.7
million. Admissions from shotguns, which had the sec-
ond highest cost per admission, had the second highest
total annual cost of over $50 million. All pairwise compa-
risons by type of firearm were statistically significant with
p < 0.05 with the exception of handgun vs. hunting rifle.
By intent, legal intervention had the highest per-
admission average cost of $33,463, followed by self-harm
at $24,369. Admissions from assaults had an average per-
admission cost of $20,989 but accounted for $389 million
in average annual costs – by far the highest overall cost by
any intent. Admissions from unintentional firearm injuries
were the second highest overall annual cost at over
$117 million. All pairwise comparisons were statistically
significant with p < 0.05.
Among payer sources, Medicaid had both the highest
per-admission average at $24,714 and the highest total
annual average of more than $205 million. Uninsured
patients accounted for an annual average of $155 mil-
lion. In sum, government and uninsured admissions
from firearm injuries accounted for nearly $400 million
in average costs per year, or 65% of all firearm admission
costs. All pairwise comparisons by type of firearm were
statistically significant with p < 0.05 with the Medicare
vs. Private/HMO.

 years of 2003 through 2013. This is an underestimate of
the overall direct hospitalization costs because readmis-
sions for further treatment may not have been identified
with an Ecode noting the original cause of the injury.
While this represents less than 1% of the overall costs of
$377 billion for all hospital stays in the US, firearm in-
juries represent relatively high costs per patient (Moore
et al., 2014). In 2012, the average cost per hospital stay
was $10,400 (Moore et al., 2014), which is less than half
of the average costs for a firearm injury. The lowest
average cost for a firearm-related admission was $16,975
for an unintentional firearm injury, and the highest were
$32,237 for an injury from an assault weapon and
$33,462 from legal intervention.
In 2012, uninsured patients comprised 5% of all hospi-
talizations, while we found that from 2003 to 2013, an
average of 30.1% of firearm injury hospitalizations were
among the uninsured (Moore et al., 2014). In contrast,
29% of all hospitalizations were paid by private insurance
compared with 21% of firearm hospitalizations. Based on
their per-hospital cost, the overall hospitalization cost, and
the low proportion of private insurance coverage, firearm
injuries pose a high burden on our healthcare system.
Our cost estimates provide only a small component of
the overall burden of firearm injuries. Studies reporting
lifetime medical and productivity costs range from $48
to $175 billion (Corso et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2014;
Miller, 2012; Fowler et al., 2015; Allareddy et al., 2012),
with differences based on the source of firearm inci-
dence data, types of firearm injuries included, sources of
cost estimates, and types of costs included in the esti-
mate. Lost productivity from premature death as well as
work time loss was the largest component of these costs,
with a smaller proportion from direct medical care.

 Studies that focus on medical care also exhibit sub-
stantial variation in methods and estimated cost burden.
Four studies report the lifetime medical care costs from
firearm injuries that occur in 1 year, and these range
from an average cost of $684 million for hospital admis-
sions in 2000 (Fowler et al., 2015) to an average cost of
$1.5 billion for hospital admissions in 2010 (Miller,
2012). These studies vary in their definition of medical
care costs, but most cover all costs, including transport,
readmission, and nursing care, and some estimate life-
time rather than annual costs (Corso et al., 2007; Lee
et al., 2014; Miller, 2012; Fowler et al., 2015; Allareddy
et al., 2012).
The two main sources for estimating non-fatal firearm
injuries are the National Inpatient Sample, used here,
and the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s Na-
tional Electronic Injury Surveillance System – All Injury
Program,
which
estimates
national
firearm
injury
hospitalization rates based on 66 hospital Emergency De-
partments (Schroeder & Ault, 2001; U.S. Consumer Prod-
uct Safety Commission, 2000). Although these hospitals
are chosen to represent a range of hospitals by size, the
sample over-represents urban emergency departments.
Estimates of firearm injuries from the National Inpatient
Sample tend to be lower than those from the National
Electronic Injury Surveillance System. For example, Lee
et al., used the National Inpatient Sample to estimate an
annual average of 28,249 hospital admissions from 2006
through 2010, and in comparison Fowler et al., estimated
an average of 36,224 per year from 2010 through 2012.
Our annual average of 30,617 was closer to other esti-
mates from the National Inpatient Sample.
We found that firearm injuries disproportionately
affect youth, males, and a non-White population. These
trends have been widely reported in previous research
(Fowler et al., 2015; Allareddy et al., 2012; Leventhal
et al., 2014). In addition, we found that assaults caused
more than 60% of admissions, followed by unintentional
injuries. These trends are also similar to those reported
in other studies of non-fatal firearm injuries (Fowler
et al., 2015; Leventhal et al., 2014). However, because
firearms are such a lethal means of suicide, suicide com-
prises a higher proportion of firearm mortality by intent
(Fowler et al., 2015). Rates of firearm hospital admis-
sions did not change significantly from 2003 through
2013. Previous studies have found that hospitalizations
decreased between 1998 and 2011 among children in-
jured by a firearm (Kalesan et al., 2016), and for all
firearm hospitalizations from 2000 to 2010 (Kalesan
et al., 2013).
Handguns
and
assaults
posed the
largest
overall
hospitalization cost burden. Although the highest per-
hospital cost was for assault weapons, handguns com-
prised over 70% of firearm injuries among those for
which the weapon type was known and the total annual
hospitalization costs were nearly $183 million. Assaults
had the third-highest cost per hospitalization and were
the most frequent intent, costing an annual total of

 nearly $373 million. Two other studies reported costs by
injury intent. Fowler et al. reported lifetime medical and
lost work time costs among those admitted to a hospital
to be approximately $475 million for unintentional fire-
arm injuries, $600 million for self-harm/suicide, and
over $2 billion for assault/homicide (Fowler et al., 2015).
Corso et al. reported the lifetime costs medical costs for
assaults as $800 million and for self-harm as $124 mil-
lion (this study included only violent firearm injuries)
(Corso et al., 2007). While these study’s estimates are
higher due to factors described above, the trends by in-
tent are similar.
No prior studies have reported costs associated with
the type of firearm, although information about the type
of firearm would be helpful to prioritize intervention ap-
proaches. One major challenge to estimating costs by
firearm type is the high prevalence of hospitalizations
for which the firearm type is unknown. In the National
Inpatient Sample, nearly 60% of the firearm types were
unknown. Handguns accounted for nearly 70% of all
hospitalizations for which weapon type was known, and
among these handguns accounted for four times the
total annual hospitalization costs than for any other type
of firearm.
In addition to a high prevalence of missing informa-
tion about firearm type, this study has other limitations.
Approximately 25% of injuries in the National Inpatient
Sample are missing Ecodes, and it is possible that these
could contain some firearm injuries. Our examination of
injury diagnoses among admissions without Ecodes sug-
gested that firearm injuries likely comprise less than 1%
of those missing Ecodes. Our sample also does not in-
clude readmissions that did not have an Ecode identify-
ing a firearm as the cause of injury, and thus our
findings are likely an underestimate. The extent of miss-
ing data for the type of firearm limits our ability to fully
examine injury and cost characteristics. The NIS is the
largest and most representative sample of US hospitali-
zations, but may be subject to sampling bias and not de-
signed specifically as a firearm injury surveillance system.
Our analysis includes only hospitalized firearm injuries,
which are about one third of all reported firearm injuries.
Conclusion
These findings demonstrate the high healthcare cost
burden of firearm injuries. Firearm disproportionately
impacts a young, minority, and uninsured population.
Hospitals can expect that the largest proportion of treat-
ment for firearm injury admissions will be reimbursed
by public sources, and, depending on trends in health in-
surance coverage, that a fifth of patients will have no in-
surance. While individual treatment costs will be highest
for assault weapon injuries and legal intervention, overall
costs will be highest for handguns and assaults. Efforts
to prevent firearm injuries, particularly among assaults
and injuries caused by handguns, could reduce this cost
burden.
