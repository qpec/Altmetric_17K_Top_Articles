Abstract
Acute and enduring adverse effects of psilocybin have been reported anecdotally, but have not 
been well characterized. For this study, 1993 individuals (mean age 30 yrs; 78% male) completed 
an online survey about their single most psychologically difficult or challenging experience (worst 
“bad trip”) after consuming psilocybin mushrooms. Thirty-nine percent rated it among the top five 
most challenging experiences of his/her lifetime. Eleven percent put self or others at risk of 
physical harm; factors increasing the likelihood of risk included estimated dose, duration and 
difficulty of the experience, and absence of physical comfort and social support. Of the 
respondents, 2.6% behaved in a physically aggressive or violent manner and 2.7% received 
medical help. Of those whose experience occurred >1 year before, 7.6% sought treatment for 
enduring psychological symptoms. Three cases appeared associated with onset of enduring 
psychotic symptoms and three cases with attempted suicide. Multiple regression analysis showed 
degree of difficulty was positively associated, and duration was negatively associated, with 
enduring increases in well-being. Difficulty of experience was positively associated with dose. 
Despite difficulties, 84% endorsed benefiting from the experience. The incidence of risky behavior 
or enduring psychological distress is extremely low when psilocybin is given in laboratory studies 
to screened, prepared, and supported participants.

 Introduction
Psilocybin, the principal psychoactive component of the Psilocybe and other genera of 
mushrooms (Presti and Nichols, 2004), has likely been used for millennia within some 
cultures for religious or divinatory purposes (Guzmán, 2008; Metzner, 2004; Stamets, 1996; 
Wasson, 1980). Of the US population aged 12 years or older, 8.7% (22.9 million people) 
reported lifetime use of psilocybin (NSDUH, 2014). In 2004–2005 (the last year data were 
available), over half (52%) of those who reported initiating use of a hallucinogen in the past 
year did so with psilocybin (NSDUH, 2007).
Although psilocybin has very low physiological toxicity and is not associated with 
compulsive drug seeking, it sometimes produces acute and, more rarely, persisting adverse 
psychological reactions (Johnson et al., 2008; Tylš et al., 2014). Case reports document 
adverse effects of psilocybin in non-research settings, including short-term distressing 
psychological symptoms such as fear (Nordic Council of Ministries, 2009; Riley and 
Blackman, 2008; van Amsterdam et al., 2011), individuals putting themselves at risk for 
physical harm (Allen et al., 1991; Schwartz and Smith, 1988; van Amsterdam et al., 2011), 
seeking medical help (Allen et al., 1991; Nordic Council of Ministries, 2009; Mowry et al., 
2014), and enduring negative psychological or psychiatric problems (Allen et al., 1991; 
Nordic Council of Ministries, 2009; Nielen et al., 2004). However, the perceived risk of 
psilocybin-related harm was found to be very low when evaluated by drug experts (Nutt et 
al., 2010; van Amsterdam and van den Brink, 2010) and by experienced drug users (Carhart-
Harris and Nutt, 2013), and psilocybin was ranked as moderately beneficial by experienced 
drug users (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2013).
Data-reporting systems from emergency rooms and poison centers also confirm that 
psilocybin is associated with seeking medical treatment (DAWN, 2013; Mowry et al., 2014). 
However, the incidence of psilocybin toxicity is extremely low relative to other drugs used 
non-medically. For instance, in 2011, emergency room mentions of problems with 
psilocybin alone (83 mentions) were only a very small fraction of mentions for heroin alone 
(10,309 mentions, 0.81%), cocaine alone (9828, 0.84%), and marijuana alone (9711, 0.85%) 
(DAWN, 2013).
The present study was undertaken to characterize challenging experiences occasioned by 
psilocybin and the consequences of such experiences. An internet survey was conducted of a 
large international sample of individuals who reported having had a difficult or challenging 
experience with psilocybin. Detailed questions were asked about an individual’s single worst 
“bad trip.” Questions addressed demographics, the set and setting conditions in which 
psilocybin was ingested, as well as any negative and positive acute and enduring 
psychological and emotional consequences of the challenging psilocybin experience.

 Methods
Participant recruitment
Participants were recruited primarily via internet advertisements and email invitation. An 
internet link to the survey was posted on websites that attract individuals interested in 
hallucinogens (e.g. Erowid, Bluelight, Reddit, etc). Information about the survey was also 
shared by email with individuals knowledgeable about psychedelic drugs, and information 
about the survey spread through online social networks. Individuals were recruited who 
endorsed having had a difficult or challenging experience after ingesting psilocybin 
mushrooms (e.g. “Have you had a difficult or challenging experience (i.e., a “bad trip”) with 
psilocybin mushrooms? If so, please take the Johns Hopkins online survey on psilocybin and 
bad trips”). The link directed participants to a webpage that described the aims of the study 
and provided basic information about study completion. Participants were informed that 
study participation was anonymous, they could choose to stop answering questions at any 
time, and if they did not complete the survey their specific responses would not be used. The 
Institutional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine approved 
all study procedures.
Survey administration
The survey was designed to take approximately 45 minutes to complete (not including an 
optional open-ended written response), and participants were required to complete the 
survey in one sitting. The survey was administered using SurveyMonkey 
(www.surveymonkey.com), an online survey and data-collection software tool with security 
and privacy features that make it suitable for clinical research.
Inclusion criteria
Participants were required to fulfill six inclusion criteria: (1) At least 18 years old; (2) Read, 
write, and speak English fluently; (3) Have taken a dose of psilocybin mushrooms that 
produced moderate to strong psychoactive effects; (4) After taking psilocybin mushrooms, 
“have you ever had a psychologically difficult or challenging experience (i.e., a bad trip)—
that is, have you experienced significant fear, anxiety, or distress or anything else that you 
found psychologically difficult?”; (5) The experience referred to above (#4) occurred when 
between 18 and 70 years old and did not occur in the context of a university or hospital 
study; (6) Have not completed this survey previously.
Participants who met the inclusion criteria were directed to the remaining questions in the 
survey. In completing the survey, participants were instructed to complete the survey items 
in reference to their single most psychologically difficult or challenging session or 
experience (worst “bad trip”). Individuals who did not meet the inclusion criteria were 
linked to an alternate, shorter version of the survey and their data were not used in the 
analyses. It was reasoned that this approach would discourage such individuals from 
attempting to take the survey again and providing different answers because it would appear 
to them that they had completed the survey. Participants were excluded from analysis if the 
challenging experience was attributed to the co-consumption of a substance other than

 psilocybin or if the open-ended written comments raised concern about validity of their 
other responses.
Measures
Demographics—Participants provided basic demographic information as described in the 
results section.
Lifetime hallucinogen use—Participants reported the total number of different 
occasions on which they had ingested any of the following hallucinogens: psilocybin 
mushrooms, LSD, morning glory seeds, mescaline, peyote cactus, San Pedro cactus, DMT, 
or ayahuasca. They also provided the total number of occasions they used only psilocybin 
mushrooms. Both questions were answered on an 8-point categorical scale (1; 2–5; 6–10; 
11–20; 21–50; 51–100; 101–300; and more than 300 times). Participants also reported how 
old they were when they first and last used psilocybin mushrooms.
Questions about the session experience—After participants had chosen their session 
(i.e. their worst “bad trip”), they were asked questions about the estimated dose of psilocybin 
consumed, the set and setting conditions in which the session occurred, the duration of the 
difficult experience, strategies attempted and that helped to stop the experience, and acute 
negative consequences of the experience. As with laboratory studies of psilocybin (Griffiths 
et al., 2006, 2011), the phenomenology of the psilocybin experience was assessed using 
three questionnaires: Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS) (Strassman et al., 1994); Mystical 
Experience Questionnaire – 30 item version (MEQ30) which is part of the States of 
Consciousness Questionnaire (Barrett et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2006; MacLean et al., 
2011); and selected subscales from the 5D-ASC (Studerus et al., 2010). Data analyzed for 
this report were the six subscales of the HRS (expressed as raw scores) and the total and four 
subscales of the MEQ30 (expressed as percentages of maximum possible scores). A 
participant was designated as having had a “complete” mystical experience if scores on each 
of the four subscales of the MEQ30 were 60% or higher. The results from other questions 
and subscales will be reported elsewhere.
Qualitative ratings of the psilocybin experience—Participants were instructed to 
answer four questions according to “how you feel now about your chosen psilocybin 
session” and to “retrospectively evaluate your experiences during your psilocybin session in 
the context of your full life experience.” The questions were as follows: (1) How 
psychologically difficult or challenging was the experience? (2) How personally meaningful 
was the experience? (3) Indicate the degree to which the experience was spiritually 
significant to you; and (4) Do you believe that the experience and your contemplation of that 
experience have led to a change in your current sense of personal well-being or life 
satisfaction? The response options for all four questions are shown in Figure 1.
Negative psychological or emotional experiences before and after the 
experience—Participants answered questions about the occurrence, duration, and severity 
of the negative psychological or emotional experiences of fear, paranoia, anxiety, depression, 
and “other” that they may have experienced at any time before the challenging experience

 occurred. Participants also answered a similar set of questions about these same types of 
negative psychological experiences if they occurred after the challenging experience and 
were attributed to the challenging psilocybin experience.
Open-ended written comments—Participants were offered an optional opportunity to 
provide a written description of their psilocybin experience.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics (percentages, mean, median, range, and standard error of the mean) 
were used to characterize the responses to questions and the subscale scores of the 
questionnaires. Pearson correlations were used to analyze the associations among participant 
ratings of the degree of difficulty of the challenging experience, the duration of the 
challenging experience, personal meaning, spiritual significance, and enduring change in 
well-being. Multiple regression analysis was used to further explore the relative roles of 
duration of difficult experience and the degree of difficulty of the experience on the ratings 
of personal meaning, spiritual significance, and enduring change in well-being. Pearson 
correlations were also used to analyze the association of difficulty and duration of difficulty 
of the psilocybin experience to dose (weight of dried mushrooms consumed and HRS item 
referring to approximate dose), setting conditions, age at time of the psilocybin experience, 
past hallucinogen experience, use of cannabis and use of another mood-altering drug 
(including cannabis, but excluding nicotine) immediately before or during the session, and 
endorsement of putting self or others at risk for physical harm. Binary logistic regression 
(odds ratios) were used to analyze the associations of setting conditions, use of cannabis and 
the use of another mood-altering drug (including cannabis, but excluding nicotine) 
immediately before or during the session to endorsement of putting self or others at risk for 
physical harm. The percentage of participants reporting negative psychological and 
emotional symptoms as well as the percentage seeking treatment for such symptoms before 
and after the chosen psilocybin session was assessed. Rates of endorsing these experiences 
were analyzed by z-tests to compare independent proportions.
Results
Survey completion
During recruitment (January–July, 2013), 5850 individuals began the survey. Of these, 1074 
were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria; 92 were excluded because 
participants reported that the experience was attributed to the co-consumption of a substance 
other than psilocybin or because the open-ended written comments raised concern about 
validity of their other responses. Some 2691 were excluded because they did not complete 
the survey, with 91% of these failing to complete half of the survey questions. Thus 1993 
individuals provided useable data. Of these, 70% found the survey link on a website, 7% 
received the survey link as a part of an email distribution list, and 13% heard of the survey 
by word of mouth. The median time to complete the survey was 59 minutes. A written 
response in the open-ended comment section was provided by 83% of participants.

 Participant characteristics
Table 1 presents participants’ reported characteristics. Participants were, on average 29.8 
years of age. The majority were male (78%), White (89%), had a college or graduate degree 
(51%). Most participants (93%) had used psilocybin more than two times in their life 
(median = 6–10 times) and had used hallucinogens more than 10 times in their life (59%) 
(median = 11–20 times). At the time of the survey, daily use of cannabis, tobacco, and 
alcohol were reported by 38%, 27%, and 11% of the group, respectively.
Participants were, on average 23.3 years of age at the time of their chosen session (Table 1), 
which occurred on average 6.5 years before completing the survey. Median number of uses 
of psilocybin before their chosen session was 2–5 times. Of the respondents, 16% had not 
used psilocybin at all before their chosen session and for 10% of the total sample, the chosen 
session was the first time they had used any hallucinogen.
The challenging psilocybin session
Some 84% and 16% of participants, respectively, reported taking dried and fresh 
mushrooms. Of those who reported knowing the weight of the mushrooms consumed, the 
median reported weight of dried psilocybin mushrooms was 4 g (n = 1203 respondents), and 
the median weight of fresh mushrooms was 21–30 g (n = 148). Of the participants, 68% 
endorsed having taken a moderately high or high dose of psilocybin; 36% reported that they 
were attempting to take a larger than usual dose of psilocybin for the session.
During the session, participants reported being alone (25%) or in the company of one person 
(24%), with a few people (39%), in a small to medium size group (9%), or a large gathering 
(4%). The majority of participants indicated that their emotional state before taking 
psilocybin (76%), the physical comfort and safety of the surroundings (76%), and the social 
support and trust for others during the session (65%) were conducive to having a positive 
experience. Only 25% had a “guide” or “sitter” present during the session and only 2.7% 
had a trusted and sober guide present who was experienced in supporting psychedelic 
sessions. Some 53% and 19%, respectively, reported using cannabis or alcohol immediately 
before or during their chosen challenging psilocybin session. Fifty-nine percent reported 
having had a serious intention (psychological or spiritual exploration) for their session; 73% 
covered or closed their eyes for some length of time during the session (median = 10–30 
minutes).
Figure 2 shows the distribution of durations of the psychologically difficult portion of the 
experience; 31% percent reported the duration to be 1 hour or less, with 25% and 40% 
reporting the duration to be 1 to 2 hours and 2 hours or longer, respectively.
Qualitative ratings of the psilocybin experience
As shown in Figure 1, the majority of participants (62%) considered the experience to be 
among the top 10 most psychologically difficult or challenging experiences of their lives 
(Figure 1, sum of among top 10, among top five and single most), with 39% rating it as 
among the top five including single most and 11% rating to be the single most. Despite this 
psychological challenge, 34% and 31% rated this same session to be among the top five 
Carbonaro et al.

 including single most personally meaningful and spiritually significant, respectively (Figure 
1), experiences of their lives, with 6.2% and 8.6%, respectively, rating it to be the single 
most personally meaningful and spiritually significant of their lives. Although most of the 
participants (76%) reported that experiences during the psilocybin session led to increases in 
current well-being and life satisfaction, 8% reported that the chosen challenging experience 
resulted in a decrease in their sense of well-being or life satisfaction (slightly or greater) 
(Figure 1). A substantial majority of participants (84%) rated that they benefited from the 
challenging portions of their sessions. Almost half (46%) endorsed that they would want to 
repeat their chosen session and all that had happened in it, including the difficult or 
challenging portions of the session.
Table 2 shows correlations among the four measures of qualitative effects described above 
and the duration of difficult experience. The duration correlated positively (r = 0.30) with the 
overall degree of difficulty of the experience, but negatively or less robustly with the 
meaningfulness, spiritual significance, or enduring changes in well-being. Interestingly, the 
degree of difficulty of the experience correlated positively with the degree of personal 
meaning (r = 0.41), with less robust but significant correlations with spiritual significance 
and enduring well-being. Finally, spiritual significance correlated robustly with personal 
meaning, and enduring change in well-being correlated robustly with both personal meaning 
and spiritual significance. Table 3 shows the results of multiple regression analysis 
regressing participant ratings of personal meaning, spiritual significance, and enduring 
change in well-being on degree of difficulty and the duration of the psychologically 
challenging experience after taking psilocybin. These data show a consistent pattern of 
effects, with personal meaning, spiritual significance, and increases in well-being all 
positively and significantly related to difficulty of experience. In contrast, all three of these 
outcome measures are significantly negatively related to the duration of the difficulty of the 
experience.
Difficulty and duration of difficulty of the psilocybin experience: Relationship of dose, 
setting conditions, use of another mood-altering drug, age, and past hallucinogen 
experience
As shown in Table 4, dose assessed by weight of dried mushrooms consumed, and estimated 
dose (from a question on the HRS), both significantly positively correlated with degree of 
difficulty and duration of difficult experience. Emotional state before ingesting psilocybin 
mushrooms, physical comfort of setting, and social support present during the session were 
significantly negatively correlated with degree of difficulty and duration of difficult 
experience. Having a guide present was significantly negatively correlated with duration of 
difficult experience, but not with degree of difficulty. The use of cannabis and/or another 
mood-altering drug (excluding nicotine) immediately before or during the session, age at the 
time of the experience, and past hallucinogen experience were significantly negatively 
correlated with difficulty of experience, but not with duration of difficult experience.

 Endorsement of putting self or others at risk of physical harm: Relationship of dose, 
setting conditions, difficulty and duration of difficulty of experience, use of another mood-
altering drug, age, and past hallucinogen experience
Endorsement of putting self or others at risk for physical harm was positively correlated with 
estimated dose (from a question on the HRS) (r = 0.071, p < 0.01), degree of difficulty of 
experience (r = 0.154, p < 0.001), and duration of difficult experience (r = 0.157, p < 0.001). 
Furthermore, endorsement of putting self or others at risk for physical harm was less likely 
in those who also endorsed that the physical comfort of the setting (odds ratio = 0.562, p < 
0.001, 95% CI [0.416, 0.760]) and the social support during the session (odds ratio = 0.657, 
p = 0.004, 95% CI [0.493–0.875]). Endorsement of risk of physical harm was not 
significantly associated with the weight of dried mushrooms, age, past hallucinogen 
experience, emotional state before ingestion, use of cannabis, or use of a mood-altering drug 
(excluding nicotine).
Hallucinogen Rating Scale and Mystical Experience Questionnaire 30
The mean (SEM) for all 1993 participants for the six subscales of the HRS were: Intensity, 
2.62 (0.01); Somaesthesia, 1.64 (0.02), Affect, 1.89 (0.01), Perception, 2.54 (0.02), 
Cognition, 2.30 (0.02), Volition, 2.02 (0.02). The means (SEM) for the subscales and total 
scores on the MEQ30 were: Mystical 45.35 (0.65), Positive Mood 50.74 (0.61), 
Transcendence of Time and Space 52.56 (0.53), Ineffability 69.24 (0.58), and Total Score 
50.26 (0.54). The percentage of participants who fulfilled criteria for having had a 
“complete” mystical experience on the MEQ30 was 20.5%.
Strategies for alleviating the challenging experience
The majority of participants reported that the social support and trust for others physically 
present (65%), physical comfort and safety of surroundings (75%), and emotional state 
(76%) before taking psilocybin was conducive to having a positive experience. Most 
participants (91%) reported trying to stop the challenging experience. As shown with the 
gray bars in Figure 3, participants tried a wide range of different strategies to attempt to stop 
the experience. Most participants reported trying to calm their mind (69%) or change 
location (63%). Some 33–40% tried to stop the experience by shifting their body, changing 
the music or social environment, or asking for help from a friend. About 25% smoked 
cannabis or changed their environment in other ways, with a minority reporting drinking 
alcohol (5%) or taking another drug (3%). The striped bars in Figure 3 show the percentage 
of participants who indicated that the specific strategy helped to substantially stop the 
challenging experience. Comparison of the gray and striped bars indicates that all strategies 
were only modestly effective (i.e. on average, striped bars are 57% as long as gray bars).
Risks and problems during the experience
Of the 1993 respondents, 10.7% reported putting themselves or others at risk of physical 
harm, 2.6% reported behaving in a physically aggressive or violent manner towards 
themselves or others, and 2.7% reported getting help at a hospital or emergency department 
during the chosen occasion.

 Suicidality
Two research staff members independently reviewed all open-ended textual responses to 
identify instances in which changes in suicidal thoughts or behavior were attributed to acute 
or enduring effects of the challenging experience. This review provided evidence of both 
increased suicidality (five cases) and decreased suicidality (six cases). More specifically, one 
individual, who had pre-existing anxiety, depression and suicidal planning, reported 
purposely attempting suicide by overdosing with benzodiazepines and, subsequently, 
awakening in an intensive care medical unit. Another respondent reported unsuccessfully 
trying to shoot himself in the head. A third respondent reported that pre-existing serious 
depression was exacerbated by the psilocybin experience and later resulted in a suicide 
attempt. Two other individuals reported salient suicidal thoughts during their psilocybin 
experience. In contrast, six respondents reported that pre-existing suicidal thoughts 
(including depression in five cases) fully remitted after their psilocybin experience.
Enduring negative psychological and emotional experiences
To meaningfully assess enduring effects, data from participants whose session occurred at 
least 1 year before completing the survey were analyzed (n = 1339). Of the participants, 
19.3% endorsed that they had sought treatment for at least one of five negative psychological 
symptoms: fear (F), anxiety (A), depression (D), paranoia (P), and “other” (O) before their 
chosen session and which they did not attribute to having taken psilocybin or some other 
hallucinogen. After the challenging session, 24% of these 1339 participants reported 
experiencing one or more of these symptoms that lasted 1 week or longer and that the 
participant attributed to the chosen psilocybin session (F = 13%, A = 16%, D = 12%, P = 
9%, O = 12%). The majority of those reporting symptoms (65%) reported more than one 
symptom. Some 10% of the 1339 participants reported psychological symptom(s) lasting 
⩾12 months after the challenging session, and 7.6% sought professional treatment for the 
symptom(s) after the chosen session (F = 3.4%, A = 4.6%, D = 4.8%, P = 1.8%, O = 3%). 
Of those who sought professional treatment after the session, 28 (2.1% of the 1339) reported 
no previous symptoms or treatment. Those that sought treatment before the challenging 
experience were significantly more likely to seek treatment afterwards (14.3% with vs. 6% 
without prior treatment histories; p < 0.001; z = 4.37). All of these findings based on the 
subset of 1339 participants were similar to those that occurred in the total participant 
sample.
Inspection of data and review of open-ended comments documented three cases in which the 
challenging experience with psilocybin was reported to be associated with the onset of 
enduring and impairing psychotic symptoms. All three were White males who were 18 to 21 
years old at the time of the experience, which had occurred 3 to 20 years before the survey. 
None of the three reported having psychotic symptoms before the experience. In their open-
ended written comments about their symptoms the first individual described auditory 
hallucinations (hearing voices) and paranoia. The second described severe depersonalization, 
very disturbing visual hallucinations, and extreme confusion. This individual subsequently 
started taking unspecified antipsychotic drugs and later received a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia. The third individual reported paranoia, agoraphobia, severe social

 withdrawal, mental confusion, and also reported that he had received diagnoses of bipolar 
disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Discussion
This survey documents that psychologically difficult experiences after taking psilocybin 
mushrooms can be associated with acute adverse effects and enduring psychological 
problems as well as enduring benefits. Almost 2000 participants, who were on average 30 
years old when they took the survey, met inclusion criteria and completed the survey on the 
basis of their single most psychologically difficult or challenging experience (worst “bad 
trip”) after taking psilocybin mushrooms. Of these respondents, 39% rated the experience as 
among the top five (including single most) most challenging experiences of their lifetime, 
11% reported putting themselves or others at risk of physical harm, 2.6% reported behaving 
in a physically aggressive or violent manner, and 2.7% reported getting medical help during 
the occasion. Of those whose session occurred at least 1 year earlier, 7.6% reported that they 
sought treatment for one or more psychological symptom they attributed to the challenging 
psilocybin experience. Three cases appeared associated with onset of enduring and 
impairing psychotic symptoms and three cases with attempted suicide.
Despite these difficulties, it is notable that 84% of respondents reported having benefited 
from the experience, with 76% reporting increased well-being or life satisfaction attributed 
to the experience. Some 60% of respondents considered their experience to be among the 
top 10 most psychologically personally meaningful experiences of their lives, while 34% 
and 31% reported the experience in the top five most personally meaningful and spiritually 
significant, respectively.
The distributions of the degree of difficulty and the degree of personal meaningfulness 
(Figure 1, top row) were strikingly similar. Furthermore, correlation and multiple regression 
analyses showed that the degree of difficulty of the experience was positively and 
significantly related to the attribution of enduring personal meaning, spiritual significance, 
and increased life satisfaction. These counterintuitive findings are consistent with clinical 
observations of psychedelic psychotherapists who have reported that, during a psychedelic 
session, the resolution of psychologically challenging experiences may result in attribution 
of meaning, spiritual significance, and increased life satisfaction (Richards, 2015), 
sometimes described as catharsis. Challenging experiences are not necessary for positive 
therapeutic outcomes. Whether some challenging experiences can have facilitative or 
detrimental effects on therapeutic outcome has not been scientifically explored.
The duration of the challenging experience was positively related to the degree of difficulty 
of the experience and negatively related to personal meaning, spiritual significance, and 
enduring increased well-being. From the perspective of maximizing meaning, spiritual 
significance, and enduring well-being, this finding suggests that therapeutic interventions 
during a challenging experience should be preferentially aimed at reducing the duration 
rather than the peak difficulty of the challenging experience.

 Dose assessed by weight of dried mushrooms consumed and estimated dose (from a 
question on the HRS) positively correlated with degree of difficulty (r = 0.11 and 0.18). This 
finding is consistent with laboratory studies showing that the frequency of challenging 
experiences increase at higher psilocybin doses (Griffiths et al., 2011; Studerus et al., 2012).
In the present study, respondents who reported having been treated for psychological 
symptoms before their challenging session were more than twice as likely than those with no 
treatment history to subsequently seek treatment for psychological symptoms that they 
attributed to the session (14.3% vs. 6%). This finding suggests alternative interpretations. 
First, those with treatment histories may be less reluctant to seek out professional treatment 
or may have better access to treatment services. Second, it is possible that those with 
treatment histories are more vulnerable to enduring adverse effects of psilocybin.
The present survey documents nontrivial rates of both acute problems (e.g. 11% putting 
themselves or others at risk for physical harm during the session) and enduring problems 
(e.g. 7.6% seeking professional help for negative psychological symptoms lasting >1 year). 
These rates are likely much higher than the expected population rates of problems with a 
single exposure to psilocybin because survey participants completed the survey based on 
their worst “bad trip”, with participants reporting a median of 6–10 prior psilocybin 
experiences. More relevant to understanding associations between psilocybin use and 
treatment-seeking for psychological problems, a population survey has indicated protective 
effects of lifetime psilocybin exposure and psychological distress and suicidality (Hendricks 
et al., 2015).
The rates and severity of both acute and enduring problems shown in the survey are notably 
higher than those we and others have observed in laboratory research studies involving 
administration of high doses of psilocybin to carefully screened, well-prepared, and closely 
monitored volunteers (e.g. Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008, 2011; Johnson et al., 2014; Studerus 
et al., 2010). At Johns Hopkins, we adhere to our published guidelines for safe 
administration of classic hallucinogens (Johnson et al., 2008). Since initiating psilocybin 
research in 2000, we have administered psilocybin doses of 20 mg/70 kg or higher to about 
250 volunteers in more than 380 sessions (as of May 2016). Although no volunteer has been 
physically harmed during sessions, there were three instances (0.9%) in which a 
participant’s disorientation during a session might have put them or staff members at risk if 
appropriate supervision had not been provided: (1) a volunteer decided to stand up and 
engage in expressive movements; (2) a volunteer moved from the couch to the floor while 
vigorously moving legs and arms in an erratic fashion; and (3) a volunteer became confused 
and disoriented when in the restroom. In response to these instances, we changed our session 
management procedures to strongly emphasize to both volunteers and session staff the 
instruction and intention that volunteers remain on the couch throughout the session when 
not engaged in a specific task or using the restroom. When volunteers need to go to the 
restroom, they walk to the restroom with the staff member at their side. When in the 
restroom, the door remains unlocked and slightly ajar with a staff member of the same 
gender remaining immediately outside of the door and in intermittent (about 1 minute 
intervals) verbal contact with the volunteer. With regard to post-session negative symptoms, 
we have had three cases (0.9%) in which volunteers reported physical or psychological

 symptoms within several days to a week after a psilocybin session. In the first case, 1 week 
after a session the volunteer reported feeling anxious after experiencing physical symptoms 
consistent with a heart attack. An evaluation at an emergency department found no abnormal 
signs. The volunteer was offered a further medical consultation that the volunteer declined as 
unnecessary. In the second case, the volunteer reported a range of symptoms that were 
ultimately diagnosed as hyperthyroidism. In the third case, the volunteer reported that the 
psilocybin session experience was dominated by negative emotions such as sadness and fear. 
After the session, the volunteer reported periods of intermittent depressed mood. The 
volunteer declined our offer to meet with a psychologist, but, instead, sought out a spiritual 
counselor. At a 5-month follow-up visit, the volunteer reported that the symptoms had 
resolved. This low rate of enduring psychological symptoms in laboratory studies is also 
consistent with a summary of such effects from 110 psilocybin research participants from 
another laboratory (Studerus et al., 2011). In that report, seven participants endorsed 
negative changes in psychological well-being, but only one participant (0.9%) reported a 
level of distress sufficient for him to contact the researchers. Those symptoms resolved after 
a few sessions with an experienced psychotherapist.
Many factors likely contribute to the higher rates of acute and enduring problems reported in 
the survey compared with the controlled laboratory studies. In addition to the probable 
absence of psychological screening and unknown psychological preparation for psilocybin 
ingestion, only 2.1% of survey respondents reported taking psilocybin under conditions that 
are usually achieved in laboratory settings (i.e. a conducive emotional state before 
administration, physical comfort and safety, social support and trust of others, and the 
presence of a sober, trusted guide who is experienced in supporting psychedelic 
experiences). Some 36% of survey respondents indicated they took a larger than usual dose 
of psilocybin and 53% reported using cannabis before or during the session. Cannabis use 
before or during the session was slightly negatively correlated with difficulty of experience, 
but had no effect on the duration of the difficult experience or the likelihood of putting 
themselves or others at risk of physical harm. Twenty-six percent of participants who tried to 
stop the challenging aspect of the psilocybin session reported using cannabis to try to do so. 
Of those, 50% reported that it helped substantially. It is noteworthy, however, that in optional 
open-ended textual responses at the end of the survey several volunteers spontaneously 
commented that the use of cannabis significantly exacerbated their challenging experience.
Several limitations of the current survey should be noted. As an anonymous internet survey, 
we cannot know if respondents were truthful in completing the survey. Furthermore, the rate 
of non-completion was high. However, respondents were not paid for their participation and 
completing the survey took about an hour on average. Furthermore, 83% of respondents took 
the time to write open-ended comments about their challenging experience at the end of the 
survey, and many spontaneously expressed their interest in and gratitude for having had the 
opportunity to complete the survey. Another limitation is that respondent population was not 
diverse: 78% were male, 89% were White, and 87% had at least some college education. On 
the other hand, this lack of diversity may accurately reflect the population of psychedelic 
users.

 Two additional factors limit the generalizability of the findings. First, only people who 
endorsed having had a challenging experience after psilocybin completed the survey. 
Therefore it is not possible to estimate the prevalence of such experiences after a single 
psilocybin exposure or after multiple psilocybin exposures. Second, because recruiting for 
the survey was primarily conducted via psychedelic-focused internet media, the participant 
sample was likely biased toward individuals with current favorable interest in psychedelic 
drugs. As such, the survey may have underestimated the severity of negative effects because 
individuals who had severe negative effects would be less likely to have heard about the 
survey.
The current study did not address hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, which is an 
uncommon DSM-5 psychiatric disorder characterized by clinically significant distress in 
response to the re-experiencing of hallucinogen-like perceptual symptoms after a period of 
normalcy following a psychedelic drug experience (Baggott et al., 2011; Halpern and Pope, 
2003).
The median reported dose of dried psilocybin mushrooms taken in the survey was 4 g, with 
most respondents (84%) reporting having taken dried mushrooms rather than fresh. 
Although there is wide variation in psilocybin and psilocin content both within and across 
different species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms (Beug and Bigwood, 1982; Bigwood 
and Beug, 1982), we estimate that 4 g of typically available dried mushrooms (P. cubensis) 
delivers the approximate psychoactive equivalent to 25 mg of psilocybin (Bigwood and 
Beug, 1982; Michael Beug, personal communication, 10 September 2015; Stamets, 1996). A 
25 mg dose of psilocybin is in the moderate to high range of doses we have administered in 
our previous laboratory studies (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2011). In the survey, the mean score 
on the HRS Intensity subscale was 2.62 (out of a maximum possible of 4.25), which is quite 
similar to the mean score of 2.64 at 20 mg/70 kg in a laboratory study (Griffiths et al., 2011). 
The mean total score from the MEQ30 in the survey was 50.3, with 21% of participants 
fulfilling criteria for a “complete” mystical experience. Comparable values in a laboratory 
study of 20 mg/70 kg were considerably higher (mean total score 70.0 and 61% complete 
mystical experience) (Barrett et al., 2015), which is consistent with the fact that survey 
participants were reporting on the most challenging psilocybin experience of their life.
In conclusion, this survey of almost 2000 people showed that psychologically difficult 
experiences after taking psilocybin mushrooms can include acute psychological distress, 
dangerous behavior, and enduring psychological problems. Factors contributing to the 
increased likelihood of putting self or others at risk of physical harm included the magnitude 
of the estimated psilocybin dose, the degree of difficulty of the experience, the duration of 
the difficult experience, and the absence of physical comfort and social support during the 
experience. Epidemiological data indicate that rates of adverse effects after psilocybin are 
very low relative to adverse effects after other psychoactive drugs. However, the findings 
from this survey affirm concerns about taking psilocybin in uncontrolled environments. With 
increasing research exploring possible therapeutic uses of psilocybin (Grob et al., 2011, 
2013; Johnson et al., 2014), it is important to note that risks of dangerous behavior or 
enduring psychological problems are extremely low in laboratory studies of psilocybin with

 carefully screened, well-prepared participants who are supported during and after psilocybin
