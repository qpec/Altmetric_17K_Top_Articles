An emerging class of targeted therapy relies on light as a spatially and
temporally precise stimulus. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinical
example in which optical illumination selectively activates light-
sensitive drugs, termed photosensitizers, destroying malignant
cells without the side effects associated with systemic treatments such
as chemotherapy. Effective clinical application of PDT and other light-
based therapies, however, is hindered by challenges in light delivery
across biological tissue, which is optically opaque. To target deep
regions, current clinical PDT uses optical fibers, but their incompatibility
with chronic implantation allows only a single dose of light to be
delivered per surgery. Here we report a wireless photonic approach to
PDT using a miniaturized (30 mg, 15 mm3) implantable device and
wireless powering system for light delivery. We demonstrate the
therapeutic efficacy of this approach by activating photosensitizers
(chlorin e6) through thick (>3 cm) tissues inaccessible by direct illu-
mination, and by delivering multiple controlled doses of light to
suppress tumor growth in vivo in animal cancer models. This versa-
tility in light delivery overcomes key clinical limitations in PDT, and
may afford further opportunities for light-based therapies.

S
ince the early application of light to treat psoriasis (1), ad-
vances in understanding and engineering light–tissue interac-
tions have enabled a class of targeted therapies with unmatched
spatiotemporal resolution. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a
clinical example in which light-sensitive drugs (photosensitizers)
are selectively activated by light (2, 3), producing reactive oxygen
species (ROS) which can be used to kill malignant cells; other
emerging treatments include photothermal therapy (4) and pho-
tobiomodulation (5). Clinical application of PDT, however, has
been hindered by the low penetration of light through biological
tissue, which limits the therapeutic depth to less than a centimeter,
even at near-infrared wavelengths (6–10). Currently, light delivery
into deeper tissue regions relies on optical fibers inserted through
surgery (11, 12) or endoscopy (13), but their incompatibility with
long-term implantation allows only a single light dose to be de-
livered. This limitation in light delivery precludes the use of PDT
for long-term therapy to suppress tumor recurrence or to tailor
the dose to the tumor response.
Here we demonstrate a wireless photonic approach to PDT that
enables on-demand light activation of photosensitizers deep in the
body. We use an implantable photonic device and wireless pow-
ering system to deliver therapeutic doses of light into tissues in-
accessible by direct illumination. The miniaturized (30 mg,
15 mm3) dimensions of the device allows its direct implantation at
the target site, where a specialized radio-frequency system wire-
lessly powers the device and monitors the light dosing rate. The
light-delivery system integrates key advances over prior non-
therapeutic systems (14–17) to enable practical PDT: (i) deep
operation near organs at human size scales, (ii) multiwavelength
light emission at radiant power levels optimized for photosensi-
tizer activation, and (iii) wireless control of light emission for
therapeutic dosimetry. We demonstrate wireless delivery of light
deep in the body in situ by activating photosensitizers through
thick (>3 cm) biological tissue and the efficacy of the light dose for
PDT in vivo by inhibiting tumor growth in a murine cancer model.
Results
System Design. Fig. 1A illustrates the key steps in cancer PDT with
the wireless device. First, the device is inserted near the target
lesion. Because of its small dimensions, the device is compatible
with minimally invasive implantation during standard clinical
procedures such as incisional biopsy or during surgical tumor re-
section to combat tumor recurrence. Second, the photosensi-
tizer––by itself harmless––is administered. Finally, the device is
wirelessly powered, illuminating the tumor and resulting in the
localized production of cytotoxic ROS that directly kill malignant
cells, damage the tumor microvasculature, and/or stimulate the
host immune response. By spatially and temporally controlling the
light dose, the therapy can be tailored for maximum efficacy and
minimum side effects.
Fig. 1 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S1 show the device and its
schematic. The device consists of a 3D helical coil that extracts
energy from the incident radio-frequency field and a microprinted
circuit board (PCB) integrating the radio-frequency rectifier and
two light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The LEDs were selected to
match the emission spectrum to the absorption peaks of chlorin e6
(Ce6, 660 and 400 nm) (Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, Fig. S2), a
clinically approved photosensitizer widely used for cancer treat-
ment (18, 19), although the general configuration can be used with
any photosensitizer with an overlapping activation spectrum. The
helical coil and PCB are encapsulated in optically transparent and
medical-grade silicone, resulting in a device that weighs 30 mg and
is 15 mm3 in volume. Silicone flaps were designed to control de-
vice orientation and for ease of fixation through sutures. The
device emits light when wirelessly powered in a radio-frequency
field with sufficient radiant power to fully illuminate a tumor
volume about 5 mm in diameter (Fig. 1E).
Significance
The low penetration of light through tissue currently limits the
therapeutic depth of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to less than
a centimeter, even at near-infrared wavelengths. We report a
wireless photonic approach to PDT in which miniaturized im-
plantable devices deliver controlled doses of light by wireless
powering through thick tissue. We demonstrate targeted can-
cer therapy with this approach by activating light-sensitive
drugs deep in the body and suppressing tumor activity in vivo
in animal models. The versatility in light delivery enabled by
this approach extends the spatial and temporal precision of
PDT to regions deep within the body.

 The encapsulation determines the biocompatibility of the de-
vice since the electronic components are not exposed to the
physiological environment. Encapsulated devices remained func-
tional over 180 d of submersion in phosphate-buffered solution and
cell media at 37 °C (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). In addition, coincubation
with cancer (MB49) and noncancer (HEK293T) model cells did
not exhibit cytotoxicity as measured by calcein and propidium io-
dide fluorescence staining (20) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
Light transport simulations and experiments characterize the
distribution of light around the device in tumor-like tissue in de-
tail. Optical measurements within a synthetic tissue slab show that
the irradiance contours approximate a sphere with center offset in
the direction of emission at both wavelengths owing to light
scattering (Fig. 2 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). The emission
is directional, indicating control of the orientation of the LEDs is
important, although optical scattering limits the spatial selectivity
of the light delivery. Simulations estimate that at a total radiant
power of 1.3 mW, the irradiance reaches 1 mW/cm2 at a radius of
4 mm for red and 1.2 mm for violet light in the direction of
maximum intensity, resulting in optical exposure of ∼2 J/cm2 over
a period of 30 min (Fig. 2 C and D), which is sufficient to activate
most photosensitizers (21, 22). These estimates are consistent with
the experiments in explanted tumor tissues (Fig. 1E), which show
the penetration of light through about 5-mm thickness. For the
selected emission wavelengths, the blood volume fraction of the
tissue is important in determining the range of light delivery (SI
Appendix, Fig. S5); the therapeutic volume depends on the type of
tumor mass and may be greater for less-vascularized tumors. The
wireless powering system is capable of achieving these levels of
radiant power deep in tissue-like material. In the midfield con-
figuration, the maximum radiant power that can be delivered by
the device exceeds 1 mW at a 4-cm depth in water at a transmit
power of 2 W (Fig. 2F). Prior studies using a phase-controlled
transmitter show that exposure to the radio-frequency field re-
sults in a mild thermal effect (less than 3 °C) localized near
the skin surface (23). The performance of the system meets the
requirements for light delivery to tumors deep in the body and
enables illumination of volumes up to ∼130 mm3 (assuming a
hemisphere volume of radius 4 mm), ∼8× the volume of the device.
A wireless dosimetry system (Fig. 2E) controls the light dose
delivered to the target region. The system is based on the mea-
surement of harmonic signals backscattered during wireless pow-
ering: As the device is powered near activation threshold, the
nonlinearity of the LEDs results in an abrupt increase in the
harmonic signal level, which is detected and used as an absolute
reference for establishing the desired light-dosing rate (SI
Appendix, Fig. S6). The backscattered harmonic signal also
facilitates the placement of the transmitter on the body surface
to optimize the transfer efficiency and avoid misalignment
between transmitter and receiver (SI Appendix). The sensitiv-
ity of light delivery to variations in wireless powering can be
further reduced by incorporating a clamping circuit to limit
light emission beyond the target rate. Across a twofold in-
crease or decrease in power level around the operating point

 (radiant power, 1.3 mW), the circuit reduces the variation in light
output from 70% to less than 10% (Fig. 2G). Thermal measure-
ments show that the delivery of the light dose at the 1.3-mW rate
limits the heat generated in tumor tissue to less than 1 °C over 2-
min irradiation after which the temperature reaches steady state
(Fig. 2H), which is well below thresholds for tissue damage.
In Vitro PDT. Photodynamic activity induced by the device deep in
tissue was tested both in vitro and in situ. Dose–response curves of
Ce6 in solution under LED illumination show ROS production
rates increasing with Ce6 concentration (0–8 μM) and light dose,
set by varying the exposure time (0, 20, and 40 min) and radiant
power (1.3 and 4.5 mW) (SI Appendix, Figs. S7–S10). Direct LED
illumination of zinc phthalocyanine and protoporphyrin IX, two
other clinically used photosensitizers with an absorption peak near
660 nm, also resulted in comparable levels of ROS in vitro (SI
Appendix, Fig. S11), indicating that the LED-mediated photody-
namic effect is not specific to the choice of photosensitizer.
To illustrate that these devices could be powered through thick
tissue at depths relevant to human scales, ROS production studies
were conducted in an adult pig model. Fig. 3 A–C show computed
tomography (CT) reconstructions of the radio-frequency trans-
mitter and device implanted in the abdomen, with the transmitter
placed on the skin and the device placed 5.1 cm deep, on the liver
surface. Wireless light delivery by the device activated Ce6 and
caused significant ROS production when powered through the
thick intervening tissue (Fig. 3D) [P < 0.0001 between control (no
Ce6) and test (solution containing 5 μM Ce6)].
Using Ce6-incubated murine bladder cancer cells, ROS pro-
duction was further validated against red laser irradiation, the
current clinical standard (24), in two configurations: (i) cells
directly exposed to the radio-frequency/laser source, and (ii) cells
placed under thick (3 cm) porcine tissue, simulating light delivery
to deep tissue regions (Fig. 3 E and F). Wireless illumination with
the device resulted in increased signal from a fluorogenic, cell-
permeable ROS sensor (Image-iT live Green ROS), both in close
proximity to the radio-frequency source and through thick tissue
(Fig. 3I). In contrast, laser illumination (37.5 mW/cm2, 4 J/cm2)
was effective only under direct irradiation: obstruction of the
beam with thick tissue resulted in insignificant ROS-induced
fluorescence. Controls consisting of light, radio-frequency field,
or Ce6 exposure alone also did not result in significant ROS
production (Fig. 3J). In all cases, significant cell death resulted
from oxidative stress (Fig. 3G). Specifically, wireless light delivery
resulted in nearly 80% cell kill in both configurations (P =
0.0027 direct and P = 0.0039 through thick tissue), whereas laser
illumination obstructed by thick tissue did not result in a signifi-
cant difference in cell viability (P = 0.178). Cell death could be
attributed to apoptosis, a widely accepted mechanism for PDT-
mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 3H) (25, 26). These results demon-
strate successful light-based targeting of malignant cells in regions
inaccessible by direct laser illumination.
In Vivo PDT. We next demonstrated the efficacy of the light-
delivery system for cancer PDT in C57BL/6 mice. The cancer
model enables the therapeutic effect of the light dose to be
tested in vivo, although the small size of the animals does not
reproduce the depth of target region. The light dose was set to
the same level (1.3 mW, 30 min) as used in the in vitro experi-
ments. Devices were implanted in the interstitial space around a

 solid tumor (SI Appendix, Fig. S12) grown to 4–6 mm diameter
from MB49 bladder cancer cells s.c. injected into the hind re-
gion. After a recovery period, PDT was performed by intra-
tumoral injection of Ce6 followed 4 h later by wireless delivery of
the light dose. Photosensitizers administered intratumorally have
been shown to be retained in tumors for several hours, which is
sufficient for the duration of the treatment (27). A second round of
treatment was administered 7 d after the first, demonstrating ease
of light delivery over long time scales. Control groups were left
untreated; received Ce6 injections only; received sham devices only;
or given light doses using functional devices without Ce6 injection.
Monitoring of the tumor volume as a function of time revealed
suppression, and in some cases complete regression, of tumors in the
treatment group compared with control groups (Fig. 4 A–C).
Wireless delivery of light dose alone did not significantly affect tu-
mor growth, indicating that the treatment efficacy was not due to the
mild thermal effect of light and/or radio-frequency field exposure.
Monitoring of tumor volume ended 13 d after first treatment, be-
yond which tumors in the majority of the mice from control groups
either reached ethical size limits or were ulcerated. Across all
groups, mice were otherwise healthy and did not show appreciable
weight loss (Fig. 4D). Resection and histological examination (cry-
osectioning and TUNEL staining) of tumors revealed a significantly
greater population of apoptotic cells in the treatment group com-
pared with control groups, indicating that photodynamic activity is
the likely mechanism for tumor destruction (Fig. 4B). Tumor vol-
umes cleared by PDT at the prescribed light dose are consistent with
light transport calculations and measurements (Fig. 2 A and B).
We compared the therapy to PDT by direct laser illumination,
the current clinical standard, by histological examination of the
tissue following a single round of treatment. Tumor-bearing mice
were injected intratumorally with Ce6 and administered either the
prior light dose using the wireless device or using a red laser
(660 nm) collimated to a 5-mm diameter spot (Materials and
Methods). In both cases, explanted tumor tissues showed compa-
rable apoptosis (Fig. 4E), but tissues sampled from regions adjacent
to the tumor did not show significant damage as assessed by
TUNEL staining (Fig. 4F). Thermal measurements show that
radio-frequency field exposure induces less than 2 °C increase in
skin temperature after 4 min of operation (SI Appendix, Fig. S13)
and was less than laser illumination (10). These results suggest that
PDT by wireless light delivery does not result in increased damage
to healthy tissues compared with current clinical standards.
We also characterized the in vivo immune response by
implanting devices in the left flank of nontumor-bearing mice
and evaluating the response 3 wk after implantation. Implanted
animals did not exhibit a significant difference in systemic re-
sponse compared with nonimplanted animals as measured by
blood fibrinogen and C3 complement concentration (SI Appen-
dix, Fig. S3 D and E) (28–30). Explantation of the device
revealed a thin (<1 mm) fibrotic capsule around the device (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3C). Histological sectioning and H&E staining of
tissues surrounding the device did not reveal significant differ-
ences in morphology compared with control tissues from the
right flank (SI Appendix, Fig. S3C). Although additional studies
will be needed to assess long-term performance, the PDT results
indicate that the performance is not degraded by the foreign
body response over the duration of the study.
Discussion
We have demonstrated a wireless implantable photonic device that
achieves therapeutic light delivery for cancer PDT. The operation
of the device deep in the body is enabled by a radio-frequency
system for wireless powering and monitoring of the light dose. As
proof of concept, we wirelessly activated photosensitizers in situ in a
porcine model of tissue and suppressed tumor activity in vivo in a
murine cancer model by delivering light doses for PDT. The ver-
satility of light delivery enabled by this approach overcomes the
depth limitation of conventional PDT and extends its spatiotem-
poral precision to regions not directly accessible to light.
The implantation of the device will be a critical step in clinical
applications. The device could be implanted during surgical
resection of the tumor to perform PDT to suppress cancer

 recurrence. Because of its small dimensions, the device could
also be designed to be compatible with minimally invasive im-
plantation techniques such as needle injection, potentially
during biopsy of the target region. Long-term implantation of
the device will also require hermetic encapsulation compatible
with light delivery and wireless powering; in this context, sili-
cone and glass encapsulations have been extensively developed
by the medical device industry and can achieve functional
lifetimes of many years. Because of the contactless nature of
light delivery, the system could potentially be more robust to
fibrosis compared with conventional modalities such as electro-
stimulation or drug delivery. Due to optical scattering and pow-
ering constraints, the therapeutic volume of light delivery for the
current system is about 1 cm in diameter, which limits its efficacy
for large tumor masses. Greater coverage could be obtained by
using photosensitizers or upconversion nanoparticles activated at
near-infrared wavelengths (10), or by distributing multiple LEDs
over the treatment region.
The PDT protocol could be further optimized to enhance the
treatment efficacy. First, targeting the photosensitizer for uptake into
tumor cells could increase the selectivity of the treatment. Carrier-
mediated drug delivery has been extensively studied for PDT (8),
and could be combined with our light-delivery system to achieve
cellular-level specificity to minimize damage to healthy tissues ex-
posed to light. Second, the PDT regimen could be fractionated or
repeated over longer time scales to improve treatment outcomes.
Fractionated dosing of photosensitizers, for example, has been used
to enhance targeting of both vasculature and tumor-cell compart-
ments (31), and pulsed-light dosing to circumvent photosensitizer
saturation or oxygen depletion (32). Finally, because the mechanisms
of PDT are distinct from conventional chemotherapeutics, our ap-
proach could also be combined with cancer drugs to overcome drug
resistance and stimulate an antitumor immune response (33–36).

 Potential clinical targets for which our approach could provide
advantages include hepatocellular carcinomas or glioblastomas,
where PDT currently provides promising outcomes compared
with conventional treatment (37, 38) but has been hindered by
the inaccessibility of the target region to light. The versatility of
light delivery allows light doses to be delivered over long time
scales in a programmable and repeatable manner, and could
potentially enable the therapies to be tailored in real time. Be-
yond PDT, the technology can be adapted for use in light-based
therapies (20) such as photothermal therapy, photocontrolled
delivery of drugs, or photobiomodulation, and integrated with
sensors to monitor the treatment response in real-time. Trans-
lating these capabilities to the clinic will provide new opportu-
nities to shine light on human disease.
Materials and Methods
Wireless Powering System. Wireless powering used a transmitter driven by a
radio-frequency signal between 1 and 1.5 GHz. Transmitters were designed
for operation both in the electromagnetic near-field (close range, <1-cm
distance) and midfield (deep in tissue, >1-cm) ranges. Wireless powering for
a prescribed light-dosing rate was established in two steps (i): while holding
the transmit power constant, the transmitter position was adjusted until the
measured harmonic backscatter was maximized (compensating for potential
misalignment between the transmitter and receiver) (ii); while holding the
transmitter position constant, the transmit power was tuned such that the
light emission was set to the desired level using the dosimetry system. De-
tailed methods may be found in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.
In Vivo PDT in Murine Model of Bladder Carcinoma. Studies conformed to the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National
Institutes of Health, USA and protocol approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee, National University of Singapore. Tumors were
induced in C57BL/6 mice by s.c. implanting 2 × 106 to 3 × 106 MB49 bladder
cancer cells in the lower flank. Two- to three weeks after inoculation of
tumor cells, mice were randomly divided into five groups (n = 5 per group)
(i) control untreated; (ii) administered with Ce6, but not given a device; (iii)
implanted with sham (nonfunctional) devices; (iv) implanted with functional
devices, but not administered Ce6; and (v) treatment group given both
Ce6 and a functional device. Devices were implanted in groups 3, 4, and
5 and treatment commenced 1 wk after implantation, during which tumors
across all groups were ∼4–6 mm in diameter. At the start of treatment,
groups 2 and 5 were injected intratumorally with 10 mg/kg of Ce6. Groups
4 and 5, implanted with functional devices, were anesthetized 4 h after
injection, and the tumor illuminated wirelessly for 30 min per mouse. A
second round of treatment was administered 7 d after following the same
procedures as the first for each group. The study ended 1 wk after the
second round of treatment due to the need to euthanize mice in groups
where tumors had reached the ethical limit. Detailed methods may be found
in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.
