Surgery: A Meta-Analysis
Joel Neugarten, Sandipani Sandilya, Beenu Singh, and Ladan Golestaneh
Abstract
Background and objectives Being a woman is a well established risk factor for the development of cardiothoracic
surgery–associated AKI. In striking contrast, women are less likely to develop AKI associated with noncardiac
surgical procedures than men. In an attempt to ascertain why being a woman might be protective for ischemic
AKI after general surgery but deleterious in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, we examined cardio-
thoracic surgery–associated AKI in greater detail.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of
cardiothoracic surgery–associated AKI studies published between January of 1978 and December of 2015 to
further explore the relationship between sex and cardiothoracic surgery–associated AKI.
Results Sixty-four studies were identified that provided sex-specific data regarding the incidence of cardiotho-
racic surgery–associated AKI among 1,057,412 subjects. Using univariate analysis, women were more likely than
men to develop AKI postoperatively (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.33; P,0.001). However,
when the analysis was restricted to the 120,464 subjects reported in 29 studies that used the Acute Kidney Injury
Network criteria, the RIFLE criteria, or the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria to define AKI,
there was no significant sex–related difference in risk. Seventeen studies used multivariate analysis to assess risk
factors for cardiothoracic surgery–associated AKI and provided sex–specific odd ratios. Among the 1,587,181
individuals included in these studies, the risk of developing cardiothoracic surgery–associated AKI was not
significantly associated with sex (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.19; P=0.51). However, when
the analysis was restricted to the 5106 subjects reported in four studies that used the Acute Kidney Injury
Network criteria to define AKI, the risk of developing AKI was significantly lower in women compared with in
men (odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.65 to 0.87; P,0.001).
Conclusions Our systematic review and meta-analysis contradict the generally held consensus that being a
woman is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiothoracic surgery–associated AKI.

Introduction
Sex dimorphism is a well recognized feature of chronic
progressive kidney disease (1). Being a woman is
thought to play a protective role, mediated by differ-
ences in the hormonal milieu (1). Although less well
appreciated, sex dimorphism has also been clearly es-
tablished in the development of ischemic AKI (2).
There is a lower incidence of AKI after noncardiac
surgery in women compared with men (3–5). In strik-
ing contrast, being a woman has repeatedly been iden-
tified as predicting the development of cardiothoracic
surgery–associated AKI (CSAKI) as well as the in-
creased morbidity and mortality associated with this
complication (6–21). The Kidney Disease Improving
Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline
for Acute Kidney Injury consensus report clearly rec-
ognizes the association between women and an in-
creased risk for CSAKI (22). The vast majority of
review articles written on the subject also identify
women as being at greater risk for CSAKI (6–21).
Moreover, several cardiovascular surgery renal risk
stratification algorithms developed to assess the pre-
operative risk of CSAKI include women as a risk fac-
tor (23–25). In an attempt to ascertain why being a
woman might be protective in patients undergoing
general surgical procedures but detrimental in pa-
tients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, we exam-
ined CSAKI in greater detail by performing a
systematic review and meta-analysis of CSAKI studies
published between January of 1978 and December of
2015.

 Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses proto-
col (26).
We searched PubMed and EMBASE for English language
articles published between January 1, 1978 and January 1,
2015. The following medical subject heading terms were
used: cardiac surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, cardiovas-
cular surgery, heart surgery, AKI, acute renal failure, and
acute renal insufficiency. We also examined the references
of the articles that were recovered for additional resources
and included those studies that satisfied the inclusion
criteria. At least two reviewers independently reviewed
titles and abstracts of the articles that were found in the
database searches to identify eligible studies. Full text
versions of the selected studies were analyzed in detail.
Any case-control or cohort study of subjects who un-
derwent cardiothoracic surgery (coronary artery bypass
graft [CABG], thoracic aorta, and/or cardiac valve surgery)
was eligible. We only included studies that reported data
on the incidence of AKI in men versus women. We
excluded studies in subjects ,18 years of age, studies in
which the sample size was ,500 patients, and studies in
which ,15% of the patients were women. We also ex-
cluded studies of subjects that underwent cardiac trans-
plant surgery or endovascular repair of cardiac valves.
Definition of AKI
We accepted studies that defined AKI by investigator-
created criteria, the Acute Kidney injury Network (AKIN)
criteria, the KDIGO criteria, the RIFLE criteria, or the
requirement for RRT (22,27,28). Investigator-created crite-
ria for AKI included a specified increase in the serum cre-
atinine level, a specified decline in calculated GFR, or a
combination of these criteria. The primary outcome was
defined as AKI after cardiac surgery by any of these
definitions.
Data Extraction
All studies were examined for duplication of data.
Attention was given to the reporting clinical center, years
covered, and overlap with larger regional or national
databases. If there was an estimated overlap of 33% or
more of individuals between any two studies, the smaller
study was excluded. To determine study quality, the
studies were independently assessed by the authors using
the Newcastle Ottawa Score for cohort and case-control
studies (29). Disagreements on the scores of individual
studies were resolved by discussion. Studies with scores
less than six were excluded from the final analysis.
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed using a random effects model with
RevMan, version 5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration). We ana-
lyzed separately studies that used univariate versus mul-
tivariate analysis.
Results
Sixty-four studies were identified that provided sex-
specific data regarding the incidence of AKI associated
with cardiothoracic surgery among 1,057,412 patients
(293,689 women and 763,723 men) (11,23–25,30–89). Sev-
enteen studies included only patients who underwent iso-
lated coronary artery bypass grafting, and two studies
included only subjects who underwent isolated valvular
surgery, whereas the remaining 45 studies included a mix-
ture of subjects who underwent isolated or combined pro-
cedures. AKI was defined by the RIFLE criteria in 12
studies, the AKIN criteria in 11 studies, the KDIGO criteria
in six studies, the need for RRT in 11 studies, and investi-
gator-defined criteria in the remaining 24 studies. Women
were more likely than men to develop CSAKI (odds ratio

 [OR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.09 to 1.33;
P,0.001) (Figures 2 and 3). When the analysis was re-
stricted to the 57,259 subjects reported in 11 studies that
used the need for RRT to define AKI, women were at even
greater risk to develop CSAKI compared with the full co-
hort (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.19 to 2.44; P=0.004). In the RRT
subset, the incidence of CSAKI among women was 4.2%
(695 of 16,554) compared with 2.6% among men (1056 of
40,705). In contrast, when the analysis was restricted to the
22,062 subjects reported in the 12 studies that used the
RIFLE criteria to define AKI, the risk of developing CSAKI
was not significantly influenced by sex (OR, 1.11; 95% CI,
0.97 to 1.27; P=0.13). In the RIFLE subset, the incidence of
CSAKI among women was 26.0% (1758 of 6763) compared
with 24.3% among men (3720 of 15,299). Similarly, when
the analysis was restricted to the 69,438 patients reported

 in the 11 studies that used the AKIN criteria to define AKI,
the risk of developing CSAKI was not significantly influ-
enced by sex (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.09; P=0.38). In the
AKIN subset, the incidence of CSAKI among women was
9.1% (1728 of 18,914) compared with 10.1% among men
(5118 of 50,524). When the analysis was restricted to the
28,964 individuals reported in the six studies that used the
KDIGO criteria to define AKI, the risk of developing
CSAKI was again not significantly influenced by sex
(OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.07; P=0.16). In the KDIGO
subset, the incidence of CSAKI among women was
27.0% (2226 of 8231) compared with 28.5% among men
(5903 of 20,733).
Fifty-five studies were identified that used multivar-
iate analysis to evaluate the factors that contributed
to CSAKI, with sex as one of the independent vari-
ables (11,23,25,30,31,33–35,38–43,45–50,52,54,55,57,58,60–
64,66,68,71–73,75,77,80,83,85,86,89–102); 17 of these 55 studies
provided sex-specific ORs (23,25,35,45,48,63,64,75,89,95–102).
Individual studies evaluated a number of covariates that
might interact with sex to influence the development of
CSAKI. These covariates included age (100% of studies);
ejection fraction or history of congestive heart failure
(100%); history of diabetes mellitus (100%); reoperation
(92%); type of surgical procedure (89%); baseline renal
function (83%); history of hypertension (75%); prior myo-
cardial infarction (58%); cardiopulmonary bypass time
(58%); body mass index, body surface area, or weight
(58%); hemoglobin level, transfusion requirement, or esti-
mated blood loss (50%); use of intra–aortic balloon pump
(50%); crossclamp time (50%); smoking (25%); use of
angiotensin–converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin
receptor blockers (8%); statin use (8%); and diuretic use
(8%). Four studies included only subjects who underwent
isolated coronary artery bypass grafting, and two studies
included only subjects who underwent isolated cardiac
valve or aortic surgery, whereas the remaining 11 studies
included a mixture of subjects who underwent isolated or
combined procedures. AKI was defined by the RIFLE cri-
teria in one study, the AKIN criteria in four studies, the
KDIGO criteria in two studies, the need for RRT in five
studies, and investigator-defined criteria in the remaining
five studies. The total group included 1,587,181 patients
(473,269 women and 1,113,912 men). In this cohort, the
risk of developing CSAKI was not significantly influenced
by sex (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.19; P=0.51) (Figure 4). In
contrast, when the analysis was restricted to the 5106 sub-
jects reported in four studies that used the AKIN criteria to
define AKI, the risk of developing CSAKI was significantly
lower in women compared with men (OR, 0.75; 95% CI,
0.65 to 0.87; P,0.001). Only three studies provided ORs for
AKI stratified by stage.
We observed a high degree of statistical heterogeneity in
our meta-analyses (univariate: I2=94%; multivariate:
I2=95%). However, statistical heterogeneity was entirely
eliminated among studies that used multivariate analysis
and defined AKI by the AKIN criteria (I2=0%). Among
studies that used univariate analysis and defined AKI by
the KDIGO criteria, statistical heterogeneity was low
(I2=21%). Absent one outlier, the degree of statistical het-
erogeneity was moderate among studies that used univar-
iate analysis and defined AKI by the KDIGO criteria
(I2=41%). The same was true among studies that used uni-
variate analysis and defined AKI by the AKIN criteria
(I2=59%).
Thirty-eight of the 55 studies that used multivariate
analysis evaluated the effect of sex on the risk of CSAKI but
failed to provide sex-specific ORs (11,30,31,33,34,38–
43,46,47,49,50,52,54,55,57,58,60–62,66,68,71–73,77,80,83,85,86,
90–94). AKI was defined by the RIFLE criteria in 10
studies, the AKIN criteria in six studies, the KDIGO criteria
in one study, the need for RRT in four studies, and

 investigator-defined criteria in the remaining 17 studies. This
cohort included 101,835 patients (27,115 women and 74,720
men). All 38 studies failed to find any significant effect of sex
on the incidence of CSAKI.
Discussion
Sex dimorphism is a well recognized feature of chronic
progressive kidney disease (1). Although less well appre-
ciated, sex dimorphism has also been clearly established in
ischemic AKI (2). Large epidemiologic studies show that
women exhibit a lower incidence of AKI after noncardiac
surgery (3–5,103–106). Kheterpal et al. (5) used data from
57,075 general surgery procedures performed in the
United States between 2005 and 2006 to create an AKI
preoperative risk stratification model. In this analysis,
being a man was found to be an independent predictor
of AKI (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.7). Grams et al. (4) ana-
lyzed 161,185 veterans (96.3% men) who underwent major
surgery (including cardiac surgery) between 2004 and
2011 and found being a man to be an independent risk
factor for AKI defined by the KDIGO criteria, by univari-
ate analysis as well as in a fully adjusted model.
AKI is an important complication of cardiothoracic
surgery that confers substantial additional morbidity and
mortality (6–21). Before the development of standardized
criteria to define AKI, this complication was reported in
0.3%–40% of patients depending on the definition of AKI
used by the investigator, the complexity of the surgical
procedures, and the prevalence of preexisting risk factors
in the study population (6–21). AKI requiring RRT was
reported to occur in 0.37%–5% of patients (6–21). Numer-
ous investigators have attempted to identify risk factors
that predispose to the development CSAKI. Risk factors
that have repeatedly been identified include baseline renal
function, the type and complexity of the surgical proce-
dure, age, women, emergency surgery, prior cardiac sur-
gery, reoperation, need for intra–aortic balloon pump,
cardiogenic shock, the length of cardiopulmonary bypass,
and comorbidities, such as insulin–requiring diabetes mel-
litus, peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure,
and chronic obstructive lung disease (6–21). More recently,
investigators have identified preoperative hemoglobin, na-
dir hemoglobin during cardiopulmonary bypass, and the
number of blood transfusions as additional risk factors
(50,57,88,107–109). More controversial are the roles played
by on- versus off-pump surgery and aprotinin use (41).
Being a woman has repeatedly been identified in these
studies as an independent risk factor for the development
of CSAKI as well as the increased morbidity and mortality
associated with this complication (6–21). Most review ar-
ticles dealing with CSAKI recognize being a woman as an
independent risk factor for its development on the basis of
retrospective and prospective studies, local databases, and
national and international registry data (6–21). The Ne-
phrology Self-Assessment Program identifies “demo-
graphic factors such as female gender. . .as independent
risk factors of [cardiovascular surgery–associated] AKI”
(110). In addition, the KDIGO consensus statement clearly
recognizes being a woman as an important risk factor for
CSAKI (22). In this context, several cardiovascular surgery
renal risk stratification algorithms have been developed to
assess the preoperative risk of CSAKI. Three prominent
scoring systems include being a woman as a risk factor
for AKI (23–25). In contrast, several other CSAKI risk algo-
rithms do not include sex as a risk factor (34,47,72,75,83,90),
and two scoring systems recognize being a woman as reno-
protective (35,111).
Among the difficulties in comparing data from the
various studies of CSAKI are the differing criteria used

 to define AKI. Although many studies used investigator-
created criteria, others used the RIFLE, the AKIN, or the
KDIGO criteria. The need for RRT is an inadequate end
point to define CSAKI because of subjectivity inherent in
the decision to initiate dialysis (24,112,113). In a cohort of
patients with AKI who underwent propensity score
matching, Wilson et al. (113) found that dialysis was
more likely to be initiated in women than in men. Noyez
(92) applied five different investigator–created definitions
of AKI obtained from the published literature to his pa-
tient cohort and found that the incidence of CSAKI varied
between 4.9% and 38.1% depending on the definition
used. Sex was found to predict CSAKI by univariate anal-
ysis using one of the definitions of AKI, but it was not
found to predict CSAKI when the other definitions were
substituted. Similarly, we found that the incidence of
CSAKI varied widely depending on the definition used.
AKI complicated cardiothoracic surgery in 5.3% of pa-
tients when all studies were combined, 28.2% of patients
in those studies in which the RIFLE criteria are used,
14.0% of patients in those studies in which the AKIN cri-
teria are used, and 26.6% of patients in those studies that
used the KDIGO criteria. RRT was required in 3.1% of
patients.
When we combined all studies that provided sex-specific
data for univariate analysis, irrespective of the definition
of CSAKI used, being a woman increased the risk of
CSAKI. In contrast, being a woman was not a risk factor
in those studies in which the RIFLE, the AKIN, or the
KDIGO criteria were used to define CSAKI. Focusing
solely on those studies that used multivariate analysis
to assess CSAKI risk, when we combined all studies
irrespective of the definition of CSAKI used, we found
no association between sex and AKI risk. However, being a
woman was found to be renoprotective by multivariate
analysis in those studies that used the AKIN criteria to define
CSAKI.
These disparate conclusions may merely reflect the
differing definitions of CSAKI, because the criteria used
to define AKI clearly influence the outcome. Alternatively,
this simple explanation may mask more complex inter-
actions between sex and cardiovascular surgery out-
comes. Moreover, failure of the covariates used in
multivariate analyses to capture these interactions may
obscure the true relationship between sex and CSAKI.
Most studies have shown that women present for car-
diovascular surgery with a higher burden of comorbid-
ities and worse cardiovascular status than men
(36,88,102,114–117). This disparity may arise from sex-
based biases in the delivery of health care or because
of a more aggressive course of cardiac disease in women
(102). It has been suggested that referral bias leads
women to undergo coronary artery revascularization or
cardiac valve surgery at a more advanced stage of disease
(102,114). Women undergoing cardiovascular surgery
also show a higher prevalence of risk factors that have
been associated with a poor outcome. An analysis of the
Society of Thoracic Surgery National Database reported
that women undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting
surgery between 1994 and 1996 were older; had a higher
prevalence of comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease; and
were more likely to undergo nonelective emergency pro-
cedures and more complicated valve surgeries than men
(114). Examination of a subset of the same database for
the years 1996 and 1997 showed that women were older
and more likely to have diabetes and hypertension but
less likely to have smoked or have triple-vessel disease
than men (88,115). Mehta et al. (88) also reported that
women undergoing cardiovascular surgery showed a
higher risk profile than men because of more advanced
age; lower body surface area and preoperative hemato-
crit; greater prevalence of congestive heart failure, car-
diogenic shock, recent myocardial infarction, unstable
angina, and shock; and increased likelihood of undergo-
ing reoperation or high-risk procedures requiring longer
cardiopulmonary bypass time and increased numbers of
transfusions.
Nadir hematocrit during cardiopulmonary bypass has
recently been identified as an additional independent risk
factor for CSAKI (50,88,108,109). Women exhibit lower
preoperative hematocrit levels and because of their smaller
body surface area, experience greater hemodilution during
cardiopulmonary bypass, resulting in a lower nadir he-
matocrit (88,108). Paradoxically, at the lowest nadir hemat-
ocrit levels, women have a lower risk of CSAKI than men,
suggesting that women may tolerate severe hemodilution
better than men (88). Because of lower nadir hematocrit
levels, women are also more likely to undergo a blood
transfusion, which itself is an established independent
risk factor for CSAKI (118). Adding further complexity
to these interactions, the greater hemodilution that women
experience in the perioperative setting may, in turn, re-
duce the rate of detection of AKI in women compared
with men (119).
Being a woman was associated with a reduced risk of
CSAKI among 503,478 subjects who underwent isolated
CABG between the years 1997 and 1999 as reported in a
multivariate analysis of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons
National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (OR, 0.94; 95%
CI, 0.89 to 1.00), whereas being a woman was associated
with an increased risk of CSAKI among 774,881 subjects
entered into the same registry who underwent isolated
CABG between 2002 and 2006 (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.21 to
1.31) (89,100) These discrepant data from the same regis-
try are consistent with our conclusion that sex is not an
independent risk factor for the development of CSAKI.
Although differing criteria to define CSAKI may explain
these inconsistent data, clearly, the anatomic and physio-
logic differences between the sexes did not change be-
tween the years 1997–1999 and 2002–2006. We believe
that factors related to but not inherent in one’s sex are
responsible for these differing outcomes. We point to dif-
ficulties in accurately quantifying differences in the sever-
ity of comorbidities and other preoperative risk factors
that may not be adequately captured in the covariates
used in the multivariate analyses.
In conclusion, our meta-analysis contradicts the gener-
ally held consensus that being a woman is an independent
risk factor for the development of CSAKI. These disparate
results may merely reflect different definitions of CSAKI.
However, this simple explanation may mask more complex
interactions between sex and cardiovascular surgery. We
believe that factors related to but not inherent in one’s sex
2118

 may be responsible for and reflect a greater burden of co-
morbidities in women undergoing cardiovascular surgery
because of disparities in health care delivery or a more ag-
gressive course of cardiovascular disease in women.
