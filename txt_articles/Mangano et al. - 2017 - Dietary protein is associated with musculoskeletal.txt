ABSTRACT
Background: Above-average dietary protein, as a single nutrient,
improves musculoskeletal health. Evaluating the link between di-
etary protein and musculoskeletal health from a whole-diet per-
spective is important, as dietary guidelines focus on dietary
patterns.
Objective: We examined the prospective association of novel di-
etary protein food clusters (derived from established dietary pattern
techniques) with appendicular lean mass (ALM), quadriceps
strength (QS), and bone mineral density (BMD) in 2986 men and
women, aged 19–72 y, from the Framingham Third Generation
Study.
Design: Total protein intake was estimated by food-frequency ques-
tionnaire in 2002–2005. A cluster analysis was used to classify
participants into mutually exclusive groups, which were determined
by using the percentage of contribution of food intake to overall
protein intake. General linear modeling was used to 1) estimate the
association between protein intake (grams per day) and BMD,
ALM, appendicular lean mass normalized for height (ALM/ht2),
and QS (2008–2011) and to 2) calculate adjusted least-squares mean
outcomes across quartiles of protein (grams per day) and protein
food clusters.
Results: The mean 6 SD age of subjects was 40 6 9 y; 82% of
participants met the Recommended Daily Allowance (0.8 g $ kg
body weight–1 $ d–1). The following 6 dietary protein food clusters
were identified: fast food and full-fat dairy, fish, red meat, chicken,
low-fat milk, and legumes. BMD was not different across quartiles
of protein intake (P-trend range = 0.32–0.82); but significant posi-
tive trends were observed for ALM, ALM/ht2 (P , 0.001), and QS
(P = 0.0028). Individuals in the lowest quartile of total protein
intake (quartile 1) had significantly lower ALM, ALM/ht2, and
QS than did those in the higher quartiles of intake (quartiles 2–4;
(P ranges = 0.0001–0.003, 0.0007–0.003, and 0.009–0.05, respec-
tively). However, there were no associations between protein clus-
ters and any musculoskeletal outcome in adjusted models.
Conclusions: In a protein-replete cohort of adults, dietary protein
is associated with ALM and QS but not with BMD. In this study,
dietary protein food patterns do not provide further insight into
beneficial protein effects on muscle outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
Age-related musculoskeletal losses are a major public health
burden because they can cause physical disability and increased
mortality. Osteoporosis accounts for w50% of all hip fractures
(1). Consequences of hip fracture include a substantially in-
creased risk of mortality (#30%) (2) and a decline in physical
function (3, 4). Osteoporosis is commonly accompanied by
sarcopenia, a syndrome characterized by progressive and gener-
alized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with risk of ad-
verse outcomes such as physical disability, poor quality of life,
and death (5). The prevention of age-related losses of bone and
muscle strength during adulthood via low-risk approaches such as
nutrition and dietary alterations is of increasing research interest.
Greater dietary protein has been shown to reduce age-related
loss of bone density (6–8), muscle mass (9–11), and muscle
strength (12–15). Although the benefits of attaining adequate
protein in the diet to optimize musculoskeletal health have been
well established, it remains unknown whether these benefits
occur as a result of absolute protein intake (i.e., attaining a
specific dietary allowance in grams per day) or whether maxi-
mizing protein intake from specific food sources is of impor-
tance. Individual protein food sources may be beneficial to the
musculoskeletal system because a specific food source may
differ in its amino acid composition, digestibility, and non-
protein nutrient composition (16). Studies that have separated
protein foods by animal protein compared with plant protein
have had conflicting results regarding their associations with
bone (17) and muscle (13, 18). This controversy is due in part to
the complexity of what seems to be a simple research question.

 The influence of dietary protein on the musculoskeletal system is
dependent on many other dietary factors such as other nonprotein
nutrients (i.e., calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D) and the acidity
of the diet (17). Although it is recommended that adults attain
adequate protein intake for musculoskeletal health, it remains
unclear if specific protein food sources or dietary patterns possess
greater benefit to the musculoskeletal system. The assessment of
whether dietary protein food patterns are differentially associated
with bone and muscle health will have important public health
implications, because precise recommendations on the type of
protein-containing foods are lacking. The objective of our study
was to examine the prospective association of novel dietary protein
food clusters [derived from established dietary pattern techniques
(19) and used by our group previously (20)] with appendicular lean
mass (ALM),6 quadriceps strength (QS), and bone mineral density
(BMD) in 2986 men and women from the Framingham Third
Generation Study. We hypothesized that not all protein food clus-
ters would be equally beneficial to bone and muscle health.
METHODS
Study population
The Framingham Third Generation Study is a longitudinal
cohort study that began in 2002 by enrolling children of the
Framingham Offspring Cohort (offspring of the Original Fra-
mingham Heart Study). By 2005, a total of 4095 Third Generation
participants were recruited. The purpose of the Framingham Heart
Study was to identify risk factors for coronary artery disease in-
cluding familial factors. Visits occur every 4–8 y, at which par-
ticipants take part in physical examinations, blood chemistries,
assessment of risk factors, and questionnaires. The Framingham
Third Generation exam 1 occurred between the years 2002 and
2005, and exam 2 occurred between the years 2008 and 2011. Of
4095 Third Generation participants, 3800 men and women had
dietary data collected at exam 1. Of this sample, food-frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) data from 188 individuals were removed
because of an invalid FFQ on the basis of the following criteria: .12
items left blank or energy intakes ,600 or .4000 kcal/d. Of
3612 participants with valid FFQ data, 8 individuals were re-
moved after an outlier analysis (described in Statistical Analysis).
The protein cluster procedure that was used to create protein
clusters included 3604 men and women. Of this sample, 2986
subjects had one or more of the following outcome measures:
BMD, ALM, or QS collected at exam 2 (2008–2011). In fully
adjusted models, 15 participants were lost because of missing data
on physical activity. All participants provided informed consent
for their participation. This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at Hebrew SeniorLife.
BMD
BMD of the hip (at the femoral neck, trochanter, and total hip)
and spine (mean BMD from L2 to L4) were scanned with the use
of a GE Lunar Prodigy fan-beam densitometer (GE Healthcare
Inc.) between the years 2008 and 2011. BMD was measured in
grams per centimeter squared. The right hip was routinely scanned;
in cases where there was a history of a previous fracture or hip
replacement, the left hip was scanned. The precision of the Prodigy
machine was 1.8% for the femoral neck, 2.3% for the trochanter,
1.2% for the total hip, and 1.1% for the lumbar spine (21).
ALM
Whole-body and regional measures of lean mass were obtained
with the GE Lunar Prodigy fan beam densitometer between the
years 2008 and 2011. Arm and leg lean body mass were measured
in grams. For participants who were too large to fit within the
dimensions of the scanning field, a hemiscan was performed (46%
of participants had a hemiscan). For the majority of participants
with a hemiscan, the right side was scanned, and the machine
imputed left-side measures to create whole-body measures. The
CV for the Prodigy device was 0.9% for total body lean mass.
ALM was calculated as the sum of leg and arm lean masses
(grams) and was also adjusted for height [appendicular lean mass
normalized for height (ALM/ht2) was calculated as ALM (grams)
divided by the square of height (meters squared)].
QS
The isometric QS of the right leg was measured with the use of
Lafayette Manual Muscle Test System (model 01163; Lafayette
Instrument) between the years 2008 and 2011. In cases where the
right leg could not be assessed (e.g., because of pain or wearing a
leg brace), the left leg was measured. In a seated position with
hands on the lap and the back supported against the chair back,
the participant’s right knee was positioned at 60 degrees of
flexion with the use of a fixed goniometer with the right foot
placed flat on the floor. The test system was held perpendicular
to the leg on the anterior surface of the tibia 6 cm above the
lateral malleolus, and the participant was instructed to kick their
leg against the test system as hard as they could for 3 s. The
procedure was repeated, and the force (kilograms) for the
maximum of both trials was used in the analyses.
Dietary assessment
Typical dietary intakes offoods and nutrients were assessed with
the use of the Harvard 126-item semiquantitative and validated
general population 88 FFQ (22, 23) during the years 2002–2005.
The Harvard FFQ has been validated extensively, and nutrient
intakes have been well correlated with those obtained with the use
of a multiple food records and biochemical measures of several
nutrients (23, 24) including dietary protein. Protein intake from
each food consumed was calculated for all participants in grams
per day. The percentage contribution of each food to total protein
intake for all individuals was calculated as
½Protein from specific food ðgÞ O total protein intake ðgÞ� 3 100 ð1Þ
for use in the cluster analysis (described in Statistical analysis).

 musculoskeletal health. These covariates (collected between 2002
and 2005) included age (years), sex, estrogen use, menopausal
status, height (meters), BMI (in kg/m2; calculated as weight divided
by the square of height), physical activity (continuous score),
smoking status (current smoker or noncurrent smoker), total en-
ergy intake (kilocalories per day), alcohol intake (grams per day),
calcium intake (milligrams per day), vitamin D intake (In-
ternational Units per day), calcium-supplement use (3 categories,
described in this section), and vitamin D–supplement use (3
categories).
Height was measured with the subject not wearing shoes to the
nearest 0.25 in (0.64 cm) with the use of a stadiometer. Weight
was measured in pounds with the use of a standard balance-beam
scale (Detecto; Worcester Scale Co. Inc.). Physical activity was
assessed with the use of a structured questionnaire to indicate the
number of hours spent performing 5 levels of activity (i.e., being
asleep, being sedentary, and performing light, moderate, and
heavy activity). The responses contributed to a weighted sum
(i.e., the physical activity index) with a score of 120 representing
24 h of constant strenuous activity and a score of 24 representing
24 h of sleeping (25). The physical activity index was calculated
from the number of hours that a subjects participated in an ac-
tivity, which were multiplied by a metabolic factor, as follows:
Physical activity index ¼ sleep þ ð1:1 3 sedentaryÞ
þ ð1:5 3 slightÞ þ ð2:4 3 moderateÞ
þ ð5:0 3 heavyÞ
ð2Þ
The hormone status of women and the sex of participants were
combined into one variable to reduce the df in regression models.
Therefore, this variable had 3 levels: 1) men, 2) estrogenic women
(premenopausal or currently taking postmenopausal estrogen),
and 3) nonestrogenic women [postmenopausal (periods stopped
for .1 y) and nonestrogen user]. Menopausal status and estrogen
use were self-reported. A medical chart review was conducted for
all participants who reported being menopausal or who used es-
trogen to verify the self-report. Typical intakes of total energy,
alcohol, calcium, and vitamin D were assessed with the use of an
FFQ. Smoking status was classified as current smoker (defined as
smoking cigarettes within the past month) or noncurrent smoker
(all other participants who were not currently smoking).
Supplement use was captured with the same FFQ that was used
to capture dietary data (22). Supplement categories for calcium and
vitamin D were chosen to differentiate between participants who
received these nutrients from a multivitamin (a marker of a healthy
lifestyle) and subjects who were taking specific supplements that
were likely to benefit their bone health. Therefore, calcium-
supplement use was categorized as follows: non–supplement
user (0 mg/d), supplement use from a multivitamin (supplemental
calcium intake .0 to ,200 mg/d), or additional supplement use
(supplemental calcium intake $200 mg/d). Vitamin D–supplement
use was categorized similarly as follows: non–supplement user,
supplement use from a multivitamin (.0 to #400 IU vitamin D/d),
or additional supplement use (.400 IU vitamin D/d).
Statistical analysis
The generation of protein food clusters was accomplished in
several steps. First, the percentage of total daily protein that was
contributed from each food was calculated for each individual.
Foods containing protein were grouped into 20 predefined food
groups on the basis of nutrient-composition similarities, protein
type, or source (Supplemental Table 1). Foods not containing
protein were not included in the formation food groups
(i.e., condiments, alcohol, and diet drinks). Food groups that
contributed ,0.5% of total daily dietary protein were removed
before the cluster analysis. Dietary protein food clusters were
generated a posteriori with the use of the FASTCLUS procedure
in SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc.). This statistical
method applied the K-means method of cluster analysis to
classify individuals into mutually exclusive groups by compar-
ing Euclidean distances between each person and each cluster
center in an iterative process (26). The cluster analysis was
sensitive to outliers; therefore, the data were checked to ensure
that no participants with protein contributions from food groups
that were .5 SDs away from the mean protein contribution
for that group were included. In addition, we ran the clustering
procedure by forcing a predefined number of 20 clusters and
removed individuals who fell into clusters of ,10 subjects
(8 participants were removed at this step). Thus, the final
sample of 3604 adults was used to create the study protein
food clusters. In this sample, the FASTCLUS procedure was
run with predetermined numbers of clusters (2–8 times) to
determine which number of clusters best interpreted the
current sample’s dietary protein food patterns of intake. The
6-cluster set was chosen to best represent individual pro-
tein food intake patterns because it presented the most-
meaningfully separated clusters, including a high F ratio,
and it distributed participants well between all clusters (each
cluster contained .100 participants). Clusters that were
derived in this study were similar to those derived in the
older Framingham Offspring Cohort (20). Further back-
ground and discussion of these methods have been described
elsewhere (26).
Nutrient intakes were adjusted for total energy with the use of
the residual method (27). Means 6 SDs for continuous variables
and proportions of participants for categorical variables were
calculated for both the total sample and within each protein food
cluster. The mean 6 SE percentages of protein intake from in-
dividual food groups were calculated across the protein food
clusters, and general linear modeling was used to make statis-
tical comparisons of intakes across the clusters. P values were
adjusted for multiple comparisons with the use of the Tukey-
Kramer test. Clusters were named on the basis of the relative
comparison of protein source foods across clusters. For example,
if the percentage of protein from fish was higher within cluster
2 than those in clusters 1 and 3–6, cluster 2 was named fish
although individuals in this cluster also consumed dietary pro-
tein from other sources (such as chicken).
Separate analyses were conducted for each musculoskeletal
measure including each BMD measure (femoral neck, trochanter,
total femur, and lumbar spine), ALM, ALM/ht2, and QS. General
linear modeling was used to assess the relation between dietary
protein (grams per day; adjusted for energy intake) and each
musculoskeletal outcome. Dietary protein was ranked in quar-
tiles, and general linear modeling was used to compare least-
squares mean BMD, ALM, ALM/ht2, and QS across protein
intake quartiles. If the protein-quartile multilevel variable was
significant (P , 0.05), pairwise comparisons across protein

 quartiles were made. Crude models were adjusted for energy
intake only; fully adjusted models were controlled for age, sex,
estrogen status (men, estrogenic women, and nonestrogenic
women), BMI, height, total energy intake, smoking status,
energy-adjusted alcohol intake, physical activity, and dietary
protein as well as for calcium-supplement use and vitamin
D–supplement use (in BMD models only). Both height and BMI
were included in the models to adequately capture the joint
relation of body composition (BMI) and body size (height) to
the health outcomes as recommended previously (28).
General linear modeling was used to compare adjusted least-
squares mean BMD, ALM, ALM/ht2, or QS between protein
food clusters. Initial BMD analyses were adjusted for age, sex,
estrogen status, BMI, height, and total energy intake. Final
BMD models were further adjusted for current smoking status,
energy-adjusted alcohol intake, calcium-supplement use, vita-
min D–supplement use, physical activity, and dietary protein. In
sensitivity analyses in which BMI was replaced with total fat
mass, there were nearly identical results; therefore, BMI was
used in all models. The resulting least-squares means for each
BMD site, ALM, ALM/ht2, and QS were compared across all
pairwise combinations of protein food-cluster groups if the mul-
tilevel variable for protein food clusters was significant (P , 0.05).
The Tukey-Kramer test was used to adjust for multiple
comparisons.
The sex-by-cluster interaction term was not significantly associ-
ated with any of the musculoskeletal outcomes in the general linear
models (P range = 0.41–0.89). Therefore, results are presented for
men and women combined. Additional models also included an
interaction term for age because losses of bone and muscle accel-
erate with age, and the cohort included a wide age range (19–72 y).
No significant interactions with age were detected with any mus-
culoskeletal outcome (P range = 0.23–0.99). All analyses were
performed with the use of SAS software (version 9.4).
RESULTS
The mean 6 SD age of subjects was 40.6 6 8.7 y with a range
of 19–72 y (Table 1). Median amounts of dietary protein within
quartiles of intake were as follows: quartile 1, 59 g/d (0.8 g/kg
body weight); quartile 2, 80 g/d (1.1 g/kg body weight); quartile
3, 99 g/d (1.3 g/kg body weight); and quartile 4, 129 g/d (1.8 g/kg
body weight). Overall, 82% of the total sample met the Recom-
mended Daily Allowance (RDA) for dietary protein of 0.8 g
intake $ kg body weight–1 $ d–1.
Cluster patterns were named on the basis of the highest per-
centage of protein intake from one or more food groups (Table 2,
footnote 2). Compared with all other protein food clusters, the fast-
food and full fat–dairy group (n = 458) presented with greater
protein intake from whole milk, cream, cheese, grains, and fast
food (i.e., pizza and French fries). The fish cluster (n = 605) pre-
sented with relatively greater protein intake from fish, yogurt, and
fruit and vegetables. The red-meat cluster (n = 640) presented with
relatively greater protein intake from red meat. The chicken cluster
(n = 735) presented with relatively greater protein intake from
chicken. The low fat–milk cluster (n = 434) presented with rela-
tively greater protein intake from low-fat milk. Last, compared with
most of the other protein food clusters, the legume protein food
cluster (n = 114) presented with greater protein intake from le-
gumes, nuts and seeds, fruit and vegetables, cereals, and grains.
Participant characteristics are described across protein food
clusters in Table 3. Dietary protein was not associated with
BMD at any site when protein intake was modeled as a con-
tinuous variable (data not shown; P range = 0.35–0.63) or as a
categorical variable (Table 4; P-trend range = 0.32–0.82). No
differences at any BMD site were observed across the 6 protein
food clusters in either crude models (data not shown) or adjusted
models (Table 5). There was no significant interaction between
the protein food cluster and age (P range = 0.09–0.95).
Dietary protein was significantly positively associated with
ALM in the adjusted continuous models (ALM: b = 0.008 6
0.002, P , 0.001; ALM/ht2: b = 0.003 6 0.001, P , 0.001) and
trended toward significance with QS (b = 0.017 6 0.009, P = 0.06).
There was a significant positive trend that was observed across
dietary protein quartiles with ALM, ALM/ht2, and QS after
adjustment for potential confounders (Table 4). Individuals in
the lowest quartile of dietary protein intake had significantly

1 All values are medians (IQRs). Values are protein intake from individual food groups within each cluster. Some food groups presented with zero
medians and IQRs because of a small percentage of individuals with high intake (.75th percentile). Naming of clusters was determined by comparing the
percentage of protein intake of a food group (from a reference cluster) with that of all other clusters. The percentages of protein intake from individual
food groups cumulatively add up to w100% and may be ,100% because of the omission of food groups that provided ,0.5% of total protein intake in the
diet.
2 Value represents the highest consumption of a food group compared with that of all other clusters and is a distinct characteristic by which the cluster was named.

 ALM and ALM/ht2 compared with those of subjects in all
other protein food clusters (Table 6). Individuals in the low
fat–milk cluster presented with significantly lower ALM and
ALM2 compared with those of participants in the fast-food and
full fat–dairy cluster. However, fully adjusted models showed
no differences in either ALM or ALM/ht2 across the 6 protein
food clusters (Table 6). No differences in QS were observed
across protein food clusters in either the crude or adjusted
models.
DISCUSSION
When dietary protein was examined as grams of intake per day
(continuous and ranked intake into quartiles), overall intake was
not associated with any measure of hip or spine BMD in this age-
diverse cohort of men and women from the Framingham Third
Generation Study. Participants with the lowest quartile of total
protein intake showed significantly lower ALM and QS compared
with those of individuals in the upper quartiles of protein intake.
Six protein food clusters were identified with the use of novel
protein-centric food cluster modeling. There were no significant
differences in BMD, ALM, or QS across protein food clusters
after accounting for other known confounders.
Results of the current study from the Framingham Study Third
Generation cohort showed no association between BMD and
dietary protein when assessed as total daily intake. This result is
contrary to previous research in large population-based cohorts in
older adults (.60 y of age), which showed dietary protein to be
positively associated with BMD cross-sectionally (29) with re-
duced bone loss over time in the Framingham Original Cohort
(6) and with reduced risk of falls (30) and fracture in the Fra-
mingham Original Cohort (31, 32) longitudinally. Null results in
the current study may be explained by the overall young age of
the cohort (mean age: 40 y) of whom only 15% of subjects were
aged .50 y, which is a time when the age-related loss of bone
mass typically becomes evident. However, this cohort was
specifically chosen because of their wide age range to examine
more-diverse protein food intake (because older adults typically
show comparable protein intakes from similar sources). In ad-
dition, the Framingham Third Generation Cohort was largely
protein replete with 82% of the sample meeting the RDA
for dietary protein (0.8 g $ kg–1 $ d–1). Dietary protein may

 maximally benefit bone health in older, more frail, or protein-
insufficient populations.
Randomized controlled trials have shown inconsistent results
on whether additional protein intake can improve bone health.
Daily supplementation with whey protein showed no change in
BMD, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, or in
volumetric BMD that was measured with the use of a quantitative
computed tomography in either a 2-y (33) or 18-mo (34) follow-
up period compared with placebo. In a weight-loss trial, a high-
protein diet (24% of kilocalories from protein) attenuated the loss
of BMD at the radius, spine, and total hip over 1 y compared with
the effect in the normal-protein group (18% of kilocalories) (35).
Women were counseled to increase their protein intake with lean
meat, fish, legumes, and dairy with an optional whey-protein
supplement if needed. Supplementation with protein from di-
etary sources compared with a whey-protein supplement may
account for the differences in results between these studies.
Our study sought to determine whether individuals from a
large community-based cohort would have different BMDs that
were dependent on their protein-derived dietary pattern. A re-
cently published study in the older Framingham Offspring Cohort
(mean age: 60 y) showed that individuals in the protein food
cluster who had high protein intakes from red meat and processed
foods had lower BMD than that of individuals in the low fat–milk
protein food cluster (20). In contrast, the current study showed
no differences in BMD across protein food clusters in the
younger generation of the Framingham Heart Study cohort. Age
may have played a role in the different results. In addition, there
was a stark difference in protein intake between the 2 cohorts,
which may also partially explain the contrast in results (93 g/d in
the younger cohort compared with 78 g/d in the older cohort).
Dietary protein is an important contributor to muscle status
because it is an important building block for muscle-fiber syn-
thesis, and the breakdown of muscle has been widely shown
under conditions of inadequate protein intake. Consistent with the
literature (9, 10), we showed that total protein intake was pos-
itively associated with ALM. Although studies that have ex-
amined the relation between total protein intake and strength in
adults have shown nonsignificant results (11, 36, 37), the current
study showed that individuals in the lowest quartile of dietary
protein had significantly lower QS than did individuals in the
higher quartiles of intake. Previous research in the older Fra-
mingham Offspring Cohort showed that greater plant protein
intake was positively associated with QS, whereas animal protein
intake showed no significant association (13). Therefore, the
current study further examined protein intake by dietary patterns.
With the use of this novel protein-centric dietary pattern meth-
odology, no significant differences across protein food clusters
were shown with either ALM or QS after other known risk factors
were taken into account. These results suggest that, in a protein-
replete population of largely middle-aged adults, higher intake of
dietary protein is linked with lean mass and strength, but the
dietary protein food pattern does not further clarify the associ-
ations with these measures of muscle health. The lack of dif-
ferences in either muscle mass or strength across protein food
clusters is an important finding because future public-health
messages that encourage older adults to meet required protein
intakes do not need to provide complicated recommendations
about specific protein-containing foods. Increased dietary protein
intake, regardless of the food source, will likely aid in the success
of reaching required amounts in a population in whom adequate
energy intake is already a problem.
Because of the single time point of the bone and muscle as-
sessment, this study was unable to determine whether dietary
protein food choices and patterns would alter bone and muscle
health over time. In addition, there were some inherent limita-
tions of the cluster methodology used such as its sensitivity to
outliers (26). To overcome these limitations, individuals who fell .5
SDs from the mean of any one protein food group were re-
moved in addition to participants who formed a cluster with ,10
individuals. The naming of protein food clusters is subjective;
therefore, the current study described methods of interpreting
cluster formations in detail. Note that, although the clusters
were named by their greatest contributions to overall protein
intakes
(such as
the chicken cluster), the clusters
all
contained a mix of protein food sources. However, the cluster
analysis offered advantages over alternative quantitative ap-
proaches because it classified participants into mutually

 exclusive, relatively homogenous clusters on the basis of a speci-
fied attribute (i.e., the percentage contribution of food groups to
total protein intake). The use of the FFQ had inherent limitations
because of the lack of detailed information on portion sizes and
specific recipes with the potential for systematic errors that could
have been due to the underreporting or overreporting of food in-
takes. Systematic errors can be partially mitigated through energy
adjustment as was used in the current study. The use of the FFQ is
best suited for ranking the typical nutrient intakes of individuals
and for food-patterning techniques as were used in the current
study.
To our knowledge, the use of the percentage contribution of
protein intake from foods to total dietary protein intake is novel.
The only other use of this methodology that was specific to
protein intake was in the older Framingham Offspring Cohort
(20). Each cohort produced a different number of clusters
(5 clusters in the Offspring Cohort and 6 clusters in the Third
Generation Cohort). Although some of these clusters showed
similar patterns of protein intake (both cohorts identified a low
fat–milk cluster, a red-meat cluster, and a chicken cluster) there
were some differences whereby the younger generation classi-
fied some participants into a cluster of legumes, nuts, seeds,
fruit, and vegetables. It is important to take these differences in
intakes of dietary protein food patterns across generations into
consideration when interpreting studies with varied results on
this topic.
In conclusion, in this large cohort of non-Hispanic white men
and women aged 19–72 y, total protein intake is positively as-
sociated with ALM and QS but not with BMD. The protein
intake pattern, as described by a cluster analysis, is not associ-
ated with differences in BMD, muscle mass, or muscle strength
in this population. Null results may be explained by the protein-
replete population studied with intakes well in excess of the
RDA for dietary protein (on average, 30–40 g above the RDA).
In protein-replete adults, protein food pattern (source) may not
contribute to musculoskeletal outcomes in a meaningful manner.
