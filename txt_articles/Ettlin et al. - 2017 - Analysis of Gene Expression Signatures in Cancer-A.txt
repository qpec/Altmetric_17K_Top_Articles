Abstract: Cancer-associated stroma (CAS) plays a key role in cancer initiation and progression.
Spontaneously occurring canine mammary carcinomas are viewed as excellent models of human
breast carcinomas. Considering the importance of CAS for human cancer, it likely plays a central
role in canine tumours as well. So far, however, canine CAS lacks characterisation, and it remains
unclear whether the biology between CAS from canine and human tumours is comparable. In this
proof-of-principle study, using laser-capture microdissection, we isolated CAS and normal stroma
from 13 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded canine simple mammary carcinomas and analysed the
expression of seven known human CAS markers by RT-qPCR (Reverse Transcription quantitative
PCR) and validated some targets by immunohistochemistry. We found that Col1a1 (Collagen1α1),
αSMA (alpha Smooth Muscle Actin), FAP (Fibroblast activation protein), PDGFRβ (Platelet-derived
growth factor receptor beta), and Caveolin-1 were significantly upregulated in canine CAS, and the
expression of CXCL12 (Stromal cell derived factor 1) significantly decreased, whereas MMP2 (Matrix
Metalloproteinase 1) and IL6 (Interleukin 6) did not change. Our results suggest strong similarities in
CAS biology in canine and human mammary carcinomas but also reveal some differences. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first report to provide a comprehensive expression analysis of the most
important CAS markers in canine simple mammary carcinomas and further supports the validity of
the dog as model for human cancer.

1. Introduction
The majority of all cancers are of epithelial origin and derive from a corrupted epithelial cell
population that gives rise to aggressively growing tumour cells. However, these epithelial tumour cells
are not living in an isolated environment, and, far from being self-sufficient, heavily depend on their
microenvironment for growth and survival (reviewed in [1]). While the vast majority of research in the
past has focused on the neoplastic cells themselves, recent progress has started to unveil the central
importance of the tumour microenvironment in cancer formation and progression. The so-called
cancer stroma consists of an extracellular matrix as well as a variety of cells, including endothelial
cells, immune cells, and fibroblasts (reviewed in [2]). Under physiological conditions, stroma serves

as an important barrier to prevent epithelial transformation (reviewed in [3]). However, in response
to emerging epithelial cancerous lesions, the stromal compartment undergoes a reprogramming
towards a tumour-supportive function, termed cancer-associated stroma (CAS), and plays a key role
in cancer initiation and progression [1]. The pivotal role of CAS in many human carcinomas (such as
breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal carcinomas) has been widely documented [4]. It has even been
suggested that components of CAS serve as actual drivers, initiating the development of a tumour
from precancerous cells (e.g., [2]). Abundant literature shows that CAS directly supports the growth of
tumour cells through secretion and/or activation of cytokines, growth factors, nutrients, and proteases
(e.g., reviewed in [1,4]). Studies performed in human clinical tumour samples have begun to shed light
on mechanisms driving the formation of CAS as well as the molecular dialogue between CAS and
tumour cells (e.g., [5–8]).
Due to the closely related pathophysiology, naturally occurring cancers in the domestic dog are
progressively leveraged as a valuable source of information to better understand the biology behind
tumour development and possibly find novel anti-cancer treatments [9–11]. Indeed, the study of
canine cancer overcomes several of the limitations of genetically modified or xenograft rodent models
for tumours [12,13]. Canine mammary tumours in particular are viewed as excellent models for human
breast cancer due to strong clinical and molecular similarities and also availability of specimens [13,14].
In dogs, the majority of mammary cancer cases are classified either as simple carcinomas or as complex
carcinomas [15]. Histologically, canine simple carcinomas very closely replicate the biology of human
simple carcinomas (e.g., reviewed in [14]). Even at the molecular level, canine simple carcinomas
replicate the genomic aberrations found in the human counterpart and have thus been demonstrated
to faithfully represent human breast carcinoma [13]. Finally, canine mammary tumours are highly
relevant in the veterinary clinical setting due to their incidence, as the most frequent cancer in intact
female dogs, as well as the difficulties of therapeutic intervention (such as e.g., control of metastases
and development of resistance to therapy) that are associated with all current cancer treatments [16].
Given the importance of CAS for the biology of human cancer, it likely plays a central role in
the development and growth of canine tumours as well. So far, however, canine CAS greatly lacks
characterisation, and it remains completely unclear whether similar markers are expressed in canine
and human CAS. Therefore it remains unclear whether CAS has a role in the growth of canine tumours,
what mechanisms are involved in its formation, and if canine CAS is comparable to human CAS.
For these reasons, we set out to analyse the expression of several genes known to be expressed in the
CAS of human breast tumours in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens from canine
simple mammary carcinoma cases. Our results provide a comprehensive overview, the first of its kind
to our knowledge, of the expression of the most important CAS markers in dogs and suggest that
CAS-related biology is very comparable between canine and human breast carcinoma.
2. Results
2.1. Selection of Cases Included in the Study
The main aims of our study were, firstly, to characterise the expression of known CAS-associated
targets from human cancer in canine mammary tumour associated stroma and, secondly, to understand
if large aspects of the underlying biology of CAS could be compared between dog and human breast
cancer. To this end, we chose to include only canine simple carcinoma cases, as this type of tumour
is recognised as a very close clinical, histological, and molecular correlate of human simple breast
carcinoma [13,14]. Cases with obvious inflammation were excluded to avoid introducing unnecessary
variability (for details, see Materials and Methods). With these criteria in mind (also see the Materials
and Methods section), we selected a total of 13 canine simple mammary carcinomas, as defined
by a board-certified veterinary pathologist (A.M.), from the archives to be included in the analysis.
The mean age of the dogs at sample collection was 9.8 years, and further characteristics of patients and
tumour samples can be found in Table 1.

2.2. Selection of Cancer Associated Stroma Markers to be Analysed in This Study
One of the inherent challenges in identifying CAS is that, because of its cellular and molecular
heterogeneity, there is no single molecule that could specifically and reliably differentiate CAS from
normal stroma. However, several studies performed with human breast cancer material have reported
a variety of factors that are produced by CAS, the expression of some of which is correlated with a
clinically unfavourable outcome. Using the available literature for gene expression changes in human
breast cancer stroma, we selected targets that have been reported by several studies as typical CAS
markers and represent a variety of different classes of molecules (Table 2).

2.3. Isolation of mRNA from Tumour Stroma and Matched Normal Stroma from Patient Material
To specifically isolate RNA from CAS and normal stroma from FFPE tissue sections of clinical
mammary carcinoma cases, we established a protocol for laser-capture microdissection (LCM),
a technique that allows the precise excision of areas of interest from microscopic tissue sections,
for canine FFPE tissue sections, followed by RNA isolation (Figure 1). Using the ArcturusXT™ Laser
Capture Microdissection System (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), we isolated matched
normal stroma and CAS from 13 clinical cases of simple mammary carcinoma (Table 1). Importantly,
normal stroma and CAS were both isolated from the exact same tissue section to minimise differences in
tissue quality and processing, thus allowing for optimal comparability of the two correlates. The areas
of interest were defined by a board-certified veterinary pathologist (Alexandra Malbon, A.M.), and
microscopic validation of the tissue before and after excision ensured the selective isolation of CAS and
normal stroma (Figure 2). RNA isolation, analysis, and preamplification were performed as specified
in the Materials and Methods section. As expected for FFPE tissue samples [41], the analysis of
mRNA quality and quantity revealed highly fragmented RNA and low yields (Table S1). Nevertheless,
the mRNA was amenable to analysis by RT-qPCR.

Three cases had to be excluded from the analysis due to insufficient housekeeping gene performance,

probably due to low RNA abundance. PDGFRB, ACTA2, and CXCL12, as well as IL6, could not be
reliably amplified in all cases, leading to different numbers of cases that were analysed for each gene,
as indicated in the respective panels (Figure 3). For details on which cases yielded data for which
primers, see Table S1.
We found that the mRNA levels of ACTA2, COL1A1, and FAP were all significantly increased
in CAS compared to the normal stroma (Figure 3A–C). These findings are consistent with data
obtained from studies on human material (Table 2 and references therein) and validate our approach
to specifically isolate RNA from CAS and normal stroma from canine FFPE mammary carcinoma
samples. No significant difference in mRNA expression levels could be detected for PDGFRB or
MMP2 (Figure 3D,E), possibly due to a combination of a small sample size and relatively modest
changes in expression of the gene, or perhaps simply because they might not change. Interestingly,
the levels of CXCL12 were significantly lower in CAS compared to normal stroma (Figure 3), which is
in contrast to the literature analysing human samples (Table 2 and references therein). The reasons
for this discrepancy are currently unclear but might suggest a difference in the role of CXCL12 in
stroma of canine compared to human mammary carcinomas. Taken together, our results showed
that at least COL1A1, ACTA2, and FAP were significantly upregulated on mRNA levels in CAS from
canine mammary carcinoma similar to human mammary carcinoma samples, whereas CXCL12 is
downregulated. These data suggest that the underlying biology of CAS is highly comparable, at least
in some aspects, between dogs and humans and that COL1A1, ACTA2, and FAP can be used as
markers of CAS in canine mammary carcinomas.

data from the cases that had not yielded mRNA data, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of all

the cases that had not yielded mRNA data, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of all thirteen
cases was performed for αSMA (alpha Smooth Muscle Actin, the product of ACTA2 gene), FAP
(Fibroblast Activation Protein), PDGFRβ (Platelet-derived Growth Factor Receptor beta), MMP2
(Matrix Metalloproteinase 1), and SDF1 (Stromal Derived Factor 1, the product of CXCL12 gene)
(Figure 3). Additionally, we analysed the expression of Caveolin-1 (Cav1), a protein that is sometimes
shown to be increased in CAS but, if decreased in CAS, has been shown to predict early recurrence
and poor clinical outcome in human breast cancer (e.g., reviewed in [42]), and FGF2, another marker
upregulated in CAS [2,39].
Immunohistochemically stained tumour sections were scored by a board-certified veterinary
pathologist (A.M.), according to the following score-system:
0 = negative, 0.5 = negligible,
1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong (see also Materials and Methods).
We found αSMA, FAP,
PDGFRβ, and Caveolin-1 to be significantly upregulated in CAS compared to normal stroma
(Figures 4A–D and 5A–D).
Staining for αSMA was only detectable in CAS as well as all vessel walls, whereas normal stroma
or epithelial cancer cells remained negative (Figure 4A), and the IHC staining score was significantly
higher in CAS compared to normal stroma (Figure 5A). These findings are in accordance with the
literature from human breast cancer studies showing an upregulation of αSMA in CAS (Table 2) and
validate our RT-qPCR results (Figure 3A). Importantly, these results further underline the specificity of
our isolation protocol for CAS and normal stroma.
Mild to moderate FAP staining could be clearly detected in the tumour stroma and was
significantly stronger than in the normal stroma, where only negligible staining could be detected,
except for vessel walls (Figures 4B, 5B and S1). Staining for FAP in epithelial cancer cells was mostly
negligible. These findings are in accordance with our RT-qPCR data (Figure 3C) and with literature
from human breast cancer studies that have demonstrated FAP upregulation in CAS (Table 2).
Staining for PDGFRβ was significantly more intense in CAS compared to normal stroma, and
no staining could be detected in epithelial cancer cells (Figures 4C and 5C). This suggested that even
though no significant increase in PDGFRB mRNA levels using RT-qPCR could be detected (Figure 3D),
possibly due to a combination of low sample size with small expression changes, protein levels of
PDGFRβ increased in CAS, which is similar to findings from human breast cancer stroma (Table 2 and
references therein).
Tissue analysed with Cav1 antibody showed mild to moderate staining for the tumour stroma
and only mild staining for the normal stroma (Figure 4D). Additionally to CAS, other cell types such
as neoplastic epithelial cells, myoepithelial cells lining tubules, smooth muscle cells, and cells of blood
vessels showed positive staining with the Caveolin-1 antibody. The IHC staining score for Cav1 was
significantly higher for CAS compared to normal stroma (Figure 5D).
While the RT-qPCR of CXCL12 mRNA levels showed a significant decrease in CAS (Figure 3G),
analysis of SDF1 protein expression by IHC revealed no significant changes between CAS and normal
stroma, while neoplastic epithelial cells stained strongly (Figures 4E and 5E). The reason for the
discrepancy between the RT-qPCR and the IHC results remains to be further investigated. One possible
explanation for this could be that stabilisation of the protein via posttranslation modifications
interferes with protein turnover, even though the transcription of the corresponding mRNA has
been downregulated. Furthermore, MMP2 and FGF2 failed to show any significant differences in IHC
staining scores between CAS and normal stroma (Figures 4F,G and 5F,G). The fact that MMP2 staining
intensity did not change significantly is in accordance with the result of RT-qPCR (Figure 3E). Thus,
the results from our IHC studies show clearly that αSMA, FAP, PDGFRβ, and Cav1 are all significantly
upregulated in canine CAS, largely mimicking the events known from human CAS.
In summary, this study provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first thorough analysis of the
gene expression signatures of known CAS-related genes from human tumour samples by RT-qPCR
and IHC in FFPE tissues from dog mammary carcinomas.

3. Discussion 
Recent cancer research has expanded its focus from mutated cancer cells to their 
microenvironment since the importance of the tumour stroma in cancer initiation, progression, and 
metastasis and the development of adaptive resistance to therapies has been unveiled [1,43,44].  
To reveal the biology of cancer, the dog represents an ideal model organism as canine cancer occurs 
spontaneously, shows similar clinical presentation, and overcomes some limitations of rodent 
models. So far however, there are only very limited data regarding the reprogramming of normal 
stroma into CAS in canine cancers compared to studies performed in human samples [12,13].  
To expand the knowledge regarding the biology of CAS in canine cancers, we set out to investigate 
the expression of known human CAS markers in the tumour stroma of canine simple mammary 
carcinoma specimens. To do this, we established the isolation of CAS and matched normal stroma by 
laser-capture microdissection (LCM) using FFPE canine simple mammary carcinoma samples 
(Figure 1). So far, few studies have been performed using LCM for analysing FFPE tissue samples 
[45,46], whereas most studies were performed using fresh frozen tissue samples [21,47] since 
fresh-frozen specimens promise a higher yield and much increased quality of mRNA. Despite low 
quantity and quality of the extracted RNA, as expected from the literature (Table S1), we were able 
to analyse the expression of all selected target genes (Table 2) by RT-qPCR (Reverse Transcription

3. Discussion
Recent cancer research has expanded its focus from mutated cancer cells to their microenvironment
since the importance of the tumour stroma in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis and the
development of adaptive resistance to therapies has been unveiled [1,43,44]. To reveal the biology of
cancer, the dog represents an ideal model organism as canine cancer occurs spontaneously, shows
similar clinical presentation, and overcomes some limitations of rodent models. So far however, there
are only very limited data regarding the reprogramming of normal stroma into CAS in canine cancers
compared to studies performed in human samples [12,13]. To expand the knowledge regarding the
biology of CAS in canine cancers, we set out to investigate the expression of known human CAS
markers in the tumour stroma of canine simple mammary carcinoma specimens. To do this, we
established the isolation of CAS and matched normal stroma by laser-capture microdissection (LCM)
using FFPE canine simple mammary carcinoma samples (Figure 1). So far, few studies have been
performed using LCM for analysing FFPE tissue samples [45,46], whereas most studies were performed
using fresh frozen tissue samples [21,47] since fresh-frozen specimens promise a higher yield and much
increased quality of mRNA. Despite low quantity and quality of the extracted RNA, as expected from
the literature (Table S1), we were able to analyse the expression of all selected target genes (Table 2) by
RT-qPCR (Reverse Transcription quantitative PCR) (Figure 3). These analyses were complemented
by immunohistochemical staining to validate the procedure as well as the obtained data and further
extend our observations (Figure 4). In the following, the findings for each target are discussed in detail.
3.1. ACTA2/αSMA
The upregulation of ACTA2 in CAS of our canine mammary carcinoma samples is consistent with
the results from human studies in which the increase of its gene product, αSMA, is associated with
poor prognosis [29–34]. αSMA plays a role in cell motility as it is a major constituent of the cytoskeleton
and is expressed by myofibroblasts during wound healing as well as cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs) [2]. Importantly, we could further validate our observations by an IHC analysis of αSMA
protein levels, which were significantly upregulated in stromal cells of the tumour but not in normal
stroma (Figures 3A, 4A and 5A). This finding is consistent with another report demonstrating an
increase in aSMA immunoreactivity in stroma of canine simple mammary carcinomas [48]. The specific
localisation of staining with αSMA to CAS but not normal stroma or neoplastic epithelial cells further
underlined the specificity of our approach in isolating CAS and normal stroma by LCM.
3.2. COL1A1/Collagen 1
We found COL1A1 to be upregulated in the canine tumour stroma by RT-qPCR (Figure 3B).
This gene encodes the Collagen1 alpha chain 1, which forms part of the extracellular matrix. This
upregulation of COL1A1 in CAS is consistent with findings in human studies [22–25] and matches
the finding that collagen is progressively deposited during breast cancer development resulting in
increased tissue stiffness as a classical fibrosis-type response of neoplasms [49].
3.3. Fibroblast Activation Protein, FAP
FAP, a serine protease expressed in the reactive stromal fibroblasts of epithelial cancers and
the granulation tissue of healing wounds, was also found significantly overexpressed in the CAS
of our canine tumour specimens by RT-qPCR (Figure 3C). Importantly, IHC for FAP confirmed this
upregulation on protein levels (Figures 4B and 5B, Figure S1). An increase in FAP expression in
canine mast cell tumour stroma by IHC has been recently demonstrated [50]. FAP is known to be
overexpressed in CAS from human breast cancer as well [27,28], and has the capacity to degrade
gelatin and type 1 collagen and therefore influences the remodelling of the ECM, supporting the
formation of a tumour-permissive milieu [28,51].

3.4. PDGFRB/PDGFRβ
PDGFRB encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family.
This protein, PDGFRβ, is secreted by CAFs and triggers cancer growth and increased pericyte coverage
of vessels, resulting in increased vessel function [18]. High stromal PDGFRβ is associated with
metastasis, larger tumour size, high histopathological grade, and shorter survival in human breast
cancer [17–19,51]. In our dataset, no significant change in relative mRNA levels comparing tumour
and normal stroma was observed (Figure 3D). However, it is possible that the inability of our analysis
to determine any significant change is caused by a combination of a small sample size and a moderate
effect size, which would necessitate a larger dataset for reliable detection. Therefore, the six cases
included in this analysis are not enough to give a proper assessment of the situation in canine mammary
cancers. Therefore, more samples would need to be analysed in order to draw a valid conclusion for
the mRNA levels of PDGFRβ in canine mammary cancer stroma. Indeed, by IHC staining, we detected
a statistically significant increase in staining of the tumour stroma compared to the normal stroma for
PDGFRβ, indicating an increase in PDGFRβ protein in CAS (Figures 4C and 5C). This finding is well
in accordance with published data for human CAS [18].
3.5. CXCL12/SDF1
CXCL12 is a chemokine secreted by cancer associated myofibroblasts and binds to the CXCR4
receptor on epithelial cells, enhancing their proliferation, migration, and invasion and thus playing
a role in tumorigenesis [20,33,35,43]. Moreover, CXCL12 is involved in angiogenesis by playing a
part in the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells into cancerous tissue [35,43]. Instead of being
upregulated, as observed in many human studies [20,35,36], we found a downregulation of CXCL12
in the CAS of our specimens (Figure 3G). A lack of an adequate amount of myofibroblasts collected
of the tumour stromal compartment compared to the normal stromal compartment seems not to be
the main cause since ACTA2 and FAP are also expressed in myofibroblasts and show an opposing
result (Figure 3A,C). Poor mRNA quality and an overall low amount of tissue samples may have had
an influence on the validity and proper detection of CXCL12, or, quite simply, the canine isoform
of CXCL12 may not play the same role in tumorigenesis in dogs as in humans. IHC staining for
SDF1, the gene product of CXCL12, did not reveal differences between CAS and normal stroma in
our analysis (Figures 4E and 5E). This could be a consequence of the stabilisation of the protein via
posttranslation modifications, which interferes with protein turnover, even though the transcription
of the corresponding mRNA has been downregulated. Another explanation would be unspecific
antibody crossreactivity with other targets that covers the real effect. Further analysis of a larger
dataset as well as validation and extension of these findings are required to draw further conclusions.
3.6. MMP2
An analysis of MMP2 revealed no significant change in gene expression (Figure 3E) or protein
levels by IHC (Figure 4F, Figure 5F), even though several breast cancer studies [20–23] have found
an upregulation of MMP2 in the tumour stroma of human patients. MMP2 is a metalloproteinase
secreted by CAFs and also tumour associated macrophages and functions by remodelling the ECM,
resulting in tumour progression, invasion, and metastasis and the support of angiogenesis [21,43]. It is
possible that a lack of increase of MMP2 expression in canine tumour stroma is due to lack of isolation
of tumour associated macrophages in our case, as we sought to avoid areas of obvious inflammation
when isolating stroma (see Materials and Methods). Moreover, CAFs may have not expressed high
amounts of MMP2 since most CAS areas collected in this study were from areas inside the tumour mass
and not at its border, where most of the remodelling processes are thought to take place. Malignant
canine mammary tumours have been found to express higher levels of MMP2 than benign tumours or
normal mammary tissue [52]. Importantly, the expression of MMP2 in these cases was detected in the
myoepithelial cells lining the basement membrane of tubuloalveolar structures in benign tumours,
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 1101
11 of 19
while malignant tumours showed MMP2 expression in the neoplastic cells themselves. This study
did not specify any expression of MMP2 in the stroma. Similarly, another report showed elevated
levels of MMP2 expression by IHC and protein activity in neoplastic cells, with the highest levels
in malignant tumours, whereas no differences in mRNA levels using the whole tumour could be
found [53]. This study also found a higher level of MMP2 expression in the stroma of tumours, with
the highest immunoreactivity found in the fibroblasts closest to the epithelial cells. Taking into account
these results, it is possible that the cell layer closest to the tumours was not always excised during the
isolation of CAS in order not to not risk a contamination of CAS material with neoplastic cells. If the
protein was indeed produced in this cell layer, this would explain why we did not detect an increase in
mRNA levels. Again, this needs to be further investigated in a larger cohort. Finally, it remains unclear
why we were not able to detect an increase in MMP2 staining by IHC as demonstrated by [53], which
could also be related to differences in the antibody used.
3.7. Interleukin 6, IL6
Examination of IL6 levels by RT-qPCR was successful for both tumour and normal stroma in
only two cases and therefore clearly showed no significant difference in gene expression, which
precludes any further interpretation of these data (Figure 3F). The cytokine is primarily secreted during
acute or chronic inflammation by inflammatory cells or CAFs promoting tumorigenesis, angiogenesis.
and metastasis [51]. Low amounts of tissue and bad mRNA quality may have had an influence on
the proper detection of IL6 as well as the avoidance of inflammatory areas during tissue collection
(see Materials and Methods section), which contain most of the IL6 secreting cells. Indeed, the study of
Chavey et al. [37] showed a correlation between the number of tumour associated macrophages and
IL6 levels in breast cancer, supporting this hypothesis.
3.8. Caveolin-1
Caveolin-1 is known to be expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts, myoepithelial cells
underlying the luminal epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and adipocytes, which clearly correlates
with our detection (Figure 4D, Figure 5D) [54,55]. While, in humans, a decrease in expression of Cav1
in tumour stroma is generally considered to be a marker of poor prognosis [42], increases in Cav1 in
CAS have also been documented to be associated with higher tumour aggressiveness [56]. Data on
Cav1 expression in CAS from canine mammary tumours is less clear, mainly because studies have
mostly focused on staining intensities in the tumour epithelia themselves and not in CAS particularly
(e.g., [55]). Further studies are warranted for a more thorough analysis and an evaluation of the
significance of these results.
Concluding, our data show that canine CAS shows similar changes in key CAS-molecules to
those found in human cancer samples, suggesting that the underlying biology is very comparable.
This further validates the use of canine simple mammary carcinomas as a model for human breast
cancer [9,10,12,13,57]. Furthermore, it is possible that some of these changes in canine CAS render the
cancer similarly more aggressive in its malignant behaviour and that such changes are associated with
poor prognosis, as is the case with human cancers [51]. Unfortunately however, as our dataset is yet
too small and there are no survival data available, these questions can not be addressed at this point
in time.
Since difficulties with primer performance in a subset of samples reduced cases that could be
included in the statistical analysis, analysis of more samples is needed to further validate our findings
and unveil more reliable and more subtle changes. It is likely that next-generation RNA sequencing
technologies would yield much more and precise data from these samples. Though technically
challenging with such small amounts of highly degraded RNA, the establishment of this approach is
expected to yield much more valuable information regarding the biology of CAS in dogs, to further
our understanding of tumour biology, and perhaps lead to biomarker discovery and the development
of new therapies for human and canine mammary carcinomas.

4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Selection of Cases for LCM
Thirteen dog mammary carcinoma samples were provided by the Institute of Veterinary Pathology
of the Vetsuisse Faculty, Zürich. All of the samples were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
samples from either the Small Animal Hospital of Zurich or external cases sent in by veterinarians
practising in Switzerland. Cases were selected with the help of a board-certified veterinary pathologist
(A.M.) using the following criteria; female dogs, simple mammary carcinomas, appropriate tumour
stroma content, FFPE samples not older than two years [58], areas with no obvious or only negligible
inflammation, and samples were paraffin-embedded on their arrival day at the Pathology, (i.e.,
no prolonged storage in formalin). During our initial screening for suitable cases, those which
contained only highly inflamed stroma were excluded. In selecting areas for LCM from our chosen
cases, no regions with aggregates of inflammatory cells were included. The cells were not specifically
counted per field as this would be highly variable according to the proportion of the field taken up by
stroma. Rather, if only individualised leukocytes (i.e., single figures of most commonly lymphocytes
and plasma cells) were present within a stromal region, it was considered appropriate to select and
any areas with aggregated inflammatory cells were removed.
4.2. Tissue Processing and Staining
Biopsy samples had been fixed immediately in 10% neutral buffered formalin and subsequently
routinely embedded in paraffin. For total mRNA analysis, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections cut at 10 µm were used. Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water was used for the
microtome HM 360 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and the blade was cleaned with
RNase away™ (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The tissue was mounted on PEN
Membrane Glass Slides (Applied Biosystems™, Waltham, MA, USA). The mounted tissue sections
were left to dry overnight at room temperature (http://support.moleculardevices.com). To visualise
the areas of interest, the tissue sections were stained for initial scrape tests with H&E, and for all
other interventions with Cresyl Fast Violet according to [59] with slight modifications (Table 3).
The slides were completely air dried before microdissection to allow for proper excision performance.
For every tissue sample that underwent LCM, a second tissue slide was stained with conventional
Hematoxylin-Eosin staining to allow for validation of tissue morphology in case of uncertainty
using the Cresy violet stain. The reagents used were xylene (Thommen-Furler AG, Rüti bei Büren,
Switzerland), ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), Hematoxylin Solution modified acc. to
Gill II (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), Ammonium Hydroxide Solution (Sigma-Aldrich), Cresyl
Fast Violet (Fluka AG, Buchs, Switzerland), and DEPC treated water (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany).

4.3. Laser-Capture Microdissection (LCM)
Tumour grading (Table S2) was performed by a veterinary pathologist (A.M.), according to the
grading system adapted for canine simple mammary carcinoma by Clemente et al. ([60] from an
existing human grading system [61]. Before microdissection, the identification of tumour stroma in
samples was performed by a veterinary pathologist (A.M.). The criteria for stroma were fibroblastic
cells, endothelial cells and pericytes of small vessels, only single inflammatory cells to avoid areas
with heavy inflammation, and no adipocytes. We also excluded medium or large vessels to maximize
the fibrous portion of the sampled stroma. The chosen stroma was morphologically different to
normal stroma, being more compact and frequently sclerotic. Using the criteria of previous papers
(e.g., [21,47]), we ensured that “normal” was at least 2 mm away from the neoplasm, but in practice the
overlying epidermis was almost always included in the biopsy so that the normal dermis immediately
beneath was sampled whenever possible (excluding adnexal structures).
For microdissection, the ArcturusXT™ Laser Capture Microdissection System (Thermo Scientific)
and Arcturus® CapSure® Macro LCM Caps (Life Technologies) were used.
Highly enriched
populations of normal or tumour-associated stroma from the specimen were identified and isolated
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Normal stroma samples were isolated from the same
slides as tumour-associated stroma, from regions specified by a veterinary pathologist (A.M.) that
presented no obvious alterations or were at least 2 mm away from the tumour [47]. The isolation
of cells of interest was verified by microscopic examination of the LCM cap as well as the excised
region after microdissection (Figure 2). After excision, the caps were put on 0.5 mL microcentrifuge
tubes (Eppendorf® Safe-Lock Tubes, Hamburg, Germany) and placed on ice until proceeding with
mRNA isolation.
4.4. Isolation of mRNA from FFPE Tissue Sections Isolated by LCM
Extraction of mRNA was performed immediately after microdissection within three hours after
staining, due to potential RNase contamination during storage [59]. A Recover All™ Total Nucleic
Acid Isolation Kit for FFPE (Ambion™) was used to extract the mRNA according to the manufacturer’s
protocol with the following small adjustments. As long exposure to xylene has been shown to be
detrimental to mRNA integrity [62] and deparaffinisation by xylene had already been performed to
stain the sections, the first deparaffinisation step using xylene and 100% ethanol was skipped, and the
excised tissue was directly immersed in a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 100 µL Digestion
Buffer and 4 µL Protease. To get the tissue into the solution, a sterile blade and forceps were used
to peel off the thermoplastic film on the cap containing the captured cells. The heating time and
temperature in step C-2a were adjusted to 3 h at 50 ◦C, followed by 20 min at 70 ◦C, according to
manufactures protocol “Optimized Extraction and Quantification of RNA from FFPE Samples for
Gene Expression Analyses” (https://tools.thermofisher.com). To elute the mRNA from the column,
RNase-free water was used to avoid the effects of the elution buffer on downstream applications.
The eluate was aliquoted before analysis and stored at −80 ◦C. mRNA abundance and quality was
analysed using the 4200 or 2200 Tape Station Software using the High Sensitivity RNA ScreenTape kit
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
4.5. cDNA Synthesis and Preamplification
To retrotranscribe mRNA into cDNA, the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit by Bio-Rad was used
according to the manufacturer’s protocol, using a maximum of 15 µL of mRNA per reaction. This kit
allows generation of cDNA with combination of oligo (dT) and random hexamer primers using low
mRNA inputs and is optimized for fragments below 1 kb of length. cDNA preamplification was done
using the TaqMan® PreAmp Master Mix (2×) (Applied Biosystems™) to produce sufficient cDNA for
qPCR analysis. The preamplification was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using
14 PCR cycles.
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 1101
14 of 19
4.6. Reverse Transcription quantitative PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using KAPA PROBE FAST qPCR Kit Master
Mix (2×) Universal reagents (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA), with 2.5 µL preamplified
cDNA per reaction in a total volume of 10 µL. RT-qPCR reactions were run in duplicates on the CFX384
Touch™ Real-Time PCR detection system (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The primers used in this
study are detailed in Table 4. The comparative CT (Cycle threshold) method was applied for the
quantification of gene expression, and the values were normalised against GAPDH, PPIA, and B2M as
endogenous controls. The results were expressed as fold changes in mRNA levels of cancer-associated
stroma over normal stroma. The primers were either customised Taqman® gene expression assays
specifically designed to detect the canine isoforms of the targeted genes (ThermoFisher Scientific), used
at final concentrations of 900 nM primers and 250 nM probes, or, for canine GAPDH, purchased from
Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland) and used at a final concentration of 300 nM primers and 200 nM
probe [63]. All primer pairs have been validated by the manufacturer, or in the case of GAPDH by [63],
and displayed at approximately 100% amplification efficiency.

designed to detect the canine isoforms of the intended targets.

4.7. Graphical Display of Results and Statistical Analysis
For all statistical analysis and graphical displays, the program GraphPad Prism (www.graphpad.
com) was used. The data was first tested for normality using the D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus
normality test and the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. If the data followed a Gaussian distribution
(normally distributed data), student’s t-test was performed to assess significance for a two-tailed
p-value with α = 0.05. If data did not pass the normality test (non-normally distributed data),
a Wilcoxon Signed Tank Test was performed to assess the significance for a two-tailed p-value with
α = 0.05.
4.8. Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections (2 µm thickness) were mounted on
positively charged slides and dried overnight at 37 ◦C. Drying was followed by the deparaffinisation
of the slides with four xylene baths for 5 min each using the Tissue-Tek® Prisma® and Film® (Sysmex,
Horgen, Switzerland). For rehydration, a degressive alcohol series using 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol,
70% ethanol, and distilled water was performed. Slides used for SDF1 immunohistochemical staining
underwent an antigen-retrieval pretreatment after rehydration by putting the slides into EDTA-buffer
(basic buffer pH 9.0) and then into a pressure cooker for 20 min at 98 ◦C, followed by rinsing with
distilled water. Thereafter all the sections were put in TBS wash-buffer 3006 (Dako, Carpinteria,
CA, USA). Immunohistochemical staining for FAP was performed as specified in [50]. Staining
for PDGFR-β, MMP-2, SDF1, FGF-2, and Caveolin-1 was performed with the Dako Autostainer
 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 1101
15 of 19
(Agilent Technologies) using polyclonal rabbit antibodies (Table 5) overnight at 4 ◦C and for αSMA
using monoclonal mouse antibody (Table 5) for 1h at room temperature. The antibodies were diluted
in the dilution-buffer S2022 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). After incubation with the primary antibody,
the slides were rinsed with TBS wash-buffer and blocked with peroxidase (peroxidase blocking buffer,
Dako S2023) for 10 min at room temperature. The αSMA slides were treated with a link biotinylated
secondary antibody for 15 min at room temperature and rinsed with TBS before peroxidase blocking.
Next, the slides were rinsed with TBS and incubated with the EnVision™ + System HRP Rabbit
Kit (Dako K4003) for 30 min at room temperature or, for αSMA, incubated with the Dako Real™
Detection Kit (Dako K5001, K5003) for 15 min at room temperature. Before removing the slides
from the Autostainer, they were rinsed with TBS and incubated with DAB (diaminobenzidine) Dako
K3468 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) for 10 min at room temperature. Removing the slides from the
Autostainer, they were rinsed with distilled water and counterstained for 2 s in Hematoxylin (modified
acc. to Gill II, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Finally the sections were rinsed with tap water,
dehydrated in the Prisma® machine (70% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol and xylene), and covered
with the Tissue-Tek®-Film®.
The immunohistochemical staining was scored semi-quantitatively by a board-certified veterinary
pathologist (A.M.) without prior knowledge of the PCR results. Scores were based on the section as a
whole, e.g. if one region composing <25% stained strongly whilst the majority remained unstained,
the score was given as mild. As the aim was to identify differences between groups, comparisons were
performed between groups for a given antibody rather than between antibodies. The scoring system
was therefore adapted slightly to suit the staining behaviour of the antibody and allow maximum
discrimination between cases. When a stain showed scant variation in staining intensity (e.g., αSMA),
the slides were assessed purely numerically. Where intensity was highly variable, the two were
factored together. Therefore a sample with strong staining in <25% would score moderate, and if in
two cases 90% of cells stained but one weakly and the other strongly, the latter would score strong
and the former moderate. Furthermore, neoplastic epithelial cells were examined for positive staining
to check if the selected genes were specifically expressed in stromal cells. The staining intensity was
scored in a scale from 0 to 3 (0: negative, 0.5: negligible (rare individual cells/barely perceptible
staining), 1: mild (up to 25% positively staining cells), 2: moderate (25–75% positively staining cells),
3: strong (>75% positively staining cells).
