Over the past 30 years, prevention science in the adolescent health field has moved from
interventions focused on preventing single problem behaviors to efforts employing a dual approach,
addressing risk factors that predict problems while simultaneously nurturing protective factors and
promoting positive development. Through an examination of previous research and empirical case
examples with vulnerable youth, this article considers the hypothesis that adolescents’ sense of
connectedness to caring adults acts as a protective factor against a range of risk behaviors.
Multivariate analyses with existing data examined indicators of youth–adult connectedness among
two groups at high risk for poor health outcomes: (1) mentor–youth relationship quality in an urban,
ethnically diverse sample of students in a school-based mentoring program (2014 survey, N¼239);
and (2) parent–youth connectedness in a statewide sample of high school students who reported
homelessness in the past year (2013 survey, N¼3,627). For youth in the mentoring program, a high-
quality youth–mentor relationship was significantly associated with positive social, academic, and
health-related behaviors. Among students who experienced homelessness, all measures of parent
connectedness were significantly associated with lower sexual risk levels. Collectively, findings from
these analyses and previously published studies by this research group provide evidence that strong,
positive relationships with parents and other caring adults protect adolescents from a range of poor
health-related outcomes and promote positive development. Youth–adult connectedness appears to
be foundational for adolescent health and well-being. Program, practice, and policy decisions should
consider what strengthens or hinders caring, connected youth–adult relationships.

INTRODUCTION
I
n a single generation, the field of adolescent health
has experienced a profound shift in both inquiry and
emphasis—moving from questions focused almost
exclusively on risk to seeking an understanding of what
promotes well-being and protects against harm in both
vulnerable groups and general populations of young
people.1 Inherent in this shift is a perspective that views
young people as “resources to be developed, not prob-
lems to be solved.”2 This perspective is infused through-
out the applied research at the University of Minnesota’s
Prevention
Research
Center
(MN-PRC).
MN-PRC
research is guided by a framework that incorporates a
strengths- and resilience-based orientation—the Healthy
Youth Development (HYD) paradigm.
HYD is defined as “the events, opportunities and
experiences that promote competence, confidence and
caring in young people.”3 This paradigm increasingly
guides youth-focused programs and research, both
domestically and internationally.4 HYD frames an
expanding body of evidence in fields including devel-
opmental
neuroscience,
developmental
psychology,

 prevention science, and social psychology that human
connections are particularly salient during the adolescent
years.5,6 The concept of connectedness is an integral
building block of HYD and core to the research of MN-
PRC, both in the development of community-partnered
interventions and analyses of large state and national data
sets. In applied research guided by HYD, connectedness is
conceptualized to include perceived caring, quality of and
satisfaction with relationships, and a sense of belonging.
Introduced into the adolescent health research literature in
the late 1980s and early 1990s,7–9 the positive effects of
connectedness to pro-social adults—within family, school,
or community—is a persistent finding in MN-PRC research
and in studies with youth worldwide. Appendix Table 1
(available online) contains youth–adult connectedness
studies conducted by researchers affiliated with MN-PRC
from its inception in 1996. These studies illuminate the
protective effects of connectedness. Both quantitative and
qualitative research conducted by MN-PRC has replicated
these findings with groups of young people from diverse
racial, ethnic, economic, and geographic backgrounds, and
across a wide array of health-related outcomes.
Two
original
analyses
conducted
by
MN-PRC
researchers are presented below, explicating the protec-
tive effects of youth–adult connectedness for well-being
among vulnerable youth. Connectedness is highlighted
with an eye toward opportunities for prevention efforts
through mentoring programs (Case Example 1) and
among homeless youth (Case Example 2).
CASE EXAMPLE 1: MENTOR–MENTEE
RELATIONSHIP QUALITY AND YOUTH
HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES
Benefits of mentoring for youth depend on the quality
and
duration
of
mentor–mentee
relationships.10
Although school-based mentoring is growing in popular-
ity, best practices in this mode are still being defined,
because matches are often shorter and constrained by
school structure when compared with out-of-school
mentoring programs. The Big Brothers Big Sisters–
Greater Twin Cities school-based mentoring program
was evaluated in 2014, with survey data from 239
mentors (69% female; mean age, 27 [range, 15–74] years;
77% white). Demographic information on their 239
youth mentees (66% female; mean age, 10 [range,
6–16] years) was provided by Big Brothers Big Sisters.
Mentees were racially/ethnically diverse (47% African
American, 14% Hispanic, 15% white, 24% multiple/
other); most were from low-income families (84%
qualified for free/reduced-price school lunch). Mentoring
relationships varied in length (mean, 17 months; range,
1–60 months); almost all pairs (97%) were matched by
gender. Multivariable regression analyses tested associa-
tions between relationship quality (6-item scale [ɑ¼0.73]
assessing closeness, communication, and connectedness)
and mentees’ health-related behaviors, as reported by
mentors.
Relationship quality was positively related to youth
social skills (po0.01) and school competence (po0.01)
(Table 1). Relationship quality was negatively related to
mentees’ bullying involvement (po0.05) and school
tardiness/absence (po0.05). Although limited to mentor
reports, findings consistently indicate that relationship
quality is related to better youth well-being.
CASE EXAMPLE 2: PARENTAL
CONNECTEDNESS AND SEXUAL HEALTH
AMONG HOMELESS YOUTH
Homeless youth are at increased risk of poor health
outcomes, yet little research has examined protective

 factors among this population. Current research is limited
by convenience samples of families and youth from shelters
and service agencies. The role of parental connectedness in
sexual health behaviors among youth reporting home-
lessness was examined using data from a 2013 statewide,
school-based survey of ninth- and 11th-graders in Minne-
sota. Overall, 5% of students reported being homeless in
the past year (n¼3,627, 45% female, 59% non-Hispanic
white). Multivariable logistic regression analyses, stratified
by sex, assessed associations between indicators of parental
connectedness (perceived parent caring, communication
with parents) and sexual health measures.
Almost half of homeless adolescents (44%) reported ever
having sex. Of these, 58% used a condom at last sexual
encounter and 20% had either been pregnant (girls) or had
gotten someone pregnant (boys). All measures of parent
connectedness were associated with less risky sexual behav-
iors in multivariable models (po0.05), with slightly different
patterns for girls and boys (Table 2). For example, although
both girls and boys who perceived greater parental caring had
lower odds of ever having sex or experiencing a pregnancy,
parental caring was associated with increased odds of using a
condom at last sexual encounter only among girls. Addition-
ally, communication with either parent was associated with
reduced odds of ever having sex, though among girls, only
maternal communication increased odds of condom use.
DISCUSSION
These case examples highlight the importance of youth–
adult connectedness among young people traditionally
considered as “at risk.” Example 1 confirms the protective
effects of connections between pre-teens, young teens, and
their mentors within a school-based setting. Example 2
provides evidence that adolescent–parent relationships
characterized by caring and open communication are
important for youth sexual health, even within particularly
challenging circumstances like homelessness.

 These case examples are cross-sectional and limited to
in-school youth. However, together with studies included
in Appendix Table 1 (available online), findings provide
evidence that strong, positive relationships with parents,
family members, teachers, school staff, and other caring
adults can protect adolescents from a range of poor
health outcomes and promote positive development.
Research conducted by MN-PRC has operationalized
youth–adult
connectedness
as
a
multidimensional
construct, including closeness, caring, and belonging.
Further research is needed to examine the relative
salience of specific dimensions of connectedness in
protecting youth from various poor health outcomes,11
and whether salient dimensions vary with development
and across social and cultural contexts.
Youth–adult connectedness appears to be foundational
for adolescent health and well-being and an active ingre-
dient of effective interventions serving vulnerable youth.
Thus, it is critical that program, practice, and policy
decisions in public health, education, health, and social
service settings consider what strengthens or hinders
connected youth–adult relationships.12 For example, as
public health services weigh the merits of available pro-
grams, a focal question could be “Does this program help to
strengthen caring relationships between youth and adults?”
This body of research informs the next generation of
preventive intervention studies at Minnesota’s PRC. Cur-
rent MN-PRC research rigorously tests youth outcomes
associated with interventions in which prosocial youth–
adult connectedness is a key objective. For example, the
effectiveness of a professional development program for
middle school teachers that emphasizes student–teacher
connectedness and student engagement to improve young
teens’ health, educational, and developmental outcomes is
being evaluated (BJ McMorris, University of Minnesota,
unpublished observations, 2016). Personalized interven-
tions are being developed that are tailored to the presence
or absence of supportive pro-social adults in adolescents’
lives.13 The aim of this research is to advance knowledge of
approaches to bolster caring, mutually responsive youth–
adult relationships in ways that promote the health and
healthy development of young people.
