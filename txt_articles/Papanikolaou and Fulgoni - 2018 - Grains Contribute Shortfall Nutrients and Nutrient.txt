Abstract: Previous data demonstrate grain foods contribute shortfall nutrients to the diet of U.S.
adults. The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans have identified several shortfall nutrients
in the U.S. population, including fiber, folate, and iron (women only). Intake of some shortfall
nutrients can be even lower in older adults. The present analyses determined the contribution of
grain foods for energy and nutrients in older U.S. adults and ranked to all other food sources in
the American diet. Analyses of grain food sources were conducted using a 24-hour recall in adults
(≥51 years old; n = 4522) using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
2011–2014. All grains provided 278 kcal/day or 14% of all energy in the total diet, ranking as the
4th largest contributor of energy compared to 15 main food groups. All grain foods ranked 1st for
thiamin (33%) and niacin (23%) intake relative to 15 main food groups. The grain foods category
ranked 2nd highest of 15 main food groups for daily dietary fiber (23%), iron (38%), folate (40%),
and magnesium (15%) and was the 3rd largest food group contributor for daily calcium intake
(13%). When considering nutrients to limit as outlined by dietary guidance, main group of grains
contributed 6% total fat, 5% saturated fat, 14% sodium and 9% added sugar. Breads, rolls and tortillas
provided 150 kcal/day or 8% of all energy in the total diet, ranking as the 2nd largest contributor
of energy compared to 46 food subcategories. Breads, rolls and tortillas ranked 1st of 46 foods for
daily thiamin (16%) and niacin (10%) intake and 2nd for dietary fiber (12%), iron (12%), folate (13%),
and magnesium (7%). Breads, rolls and tortillas ranked 3rd largest food group contributor for daily
calcium (5%) intake. Ready-to-eat cereals provided 47 kcal/day or 2% of all energy in the total diet,
ranking as the 20th largest contributor of energy compared to 46 food subcategories. All ready-to-eat
cereals ranked 1st for daily iron (19%), 1st for folate (21%), 5th for dietary fiber (7%), 3rd for niacin
(9%), 8th for magnesium (4%), and 13th for calcium (2%) intake. Given all grain foods and specific
subcategories of grain foods provided a greater percentage of several underconsumed nutrients
than calories (including dietary fiber, iron, and folate), grain foods provide nutrient density in the
American diet of the older adult.

1. Introduction
Food sources of energy and nutrients research in the United States (U.S.) has shown that the grain
category can play an important contributory role in the diet of all children, adolescents and adults [1,2].
Specifically, grain foods, relative to energy (kcal) provided a greater percentage of 2015–2020 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans (2015–2020 DGA) under-consumed nutrients and nutrients of public health
concern [3], including dietary fiber, folate, magnesium, calcium and iron. Breads, rolls, tortillas and

ready-to-eat cereals, as subcategories of grain foods, are also meaningful contributors (i.e., ≥10% in the
diet) of dietary fiber, thiamin, folate, iron, zinc and niacin to the American diet [1,2]. Further, earlier
data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003–2006 in Americans
aged ≥2 years old, identified that significant amounts of vitamins A, B6, B12, C and D, as well as
thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate and iron were from enriched and/or fortified foods with researchers
concluding that without enrichment and/or fortification, nutrient shortfalls are further exacerbated [4].
Nevertheless, previous studies have focused on children and all adults (≥19 years old) with no current
data isolating older Americans (i.e., >50 years old). Indeed, this demographic represents a significant
segment of the U.S. population with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stating
“the growth in the number and proportion of older adults is unprecedented in the history of the U.S.
with two factors contributing to the increased number of older adults—increased life spans and aging
baby boomers”. The CDC has estimated that the American population for those aged 65 years or
older will double in 25 years to approximately 72 million [5]. The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans (2015–2020 DGA) recommends all individuals two years of age and older meet nutrient
requirements through foods as part of a nutrient-dense diet; however, many individuals fall short in
several nutrients, resulting in the declaration that several nutrients are under-consumed relative to the
estimated average requirement (EAR; the average daily nutrient intake level estimated to meet the
requirements of half of the healthy individuals in a group) or adequate intake levels established by the
National Academy of Medicine (formerly known as the Institute of Medicine) [3].
Indeed, healthy aging is multifactorial, however, nutrition is one of the key determinants of
successful aging, as it has been documented to promote health and functionality [6]. Thus, adequate
intake of macronutrients and micronutrients represents a key factor in healthy aging. The 2015–2020 DGA
identified under-consumed nutrients as shortfall nutrients and included vitamins A, D, E, C, folate,
calcium, magnesium, fiber, potassium and iron in specific populations [3]. Similar to the preceding
policy and scientific advisory committee reports [7,8], the 2015–2020 DGA continues to highlight
calcium, potassium, vitamin D and fiber as shortfall ‘nutrients of public health concern’ in Americans,
since under-consumption of these nutrients has been associated with adverse health outcomes. Dietary
recommendations further advocate for increased whole grain consumption (i.e., make half your grains
whole grains) while limiting enriched/refined grains in the diet [3]. While certain grain food products
contribute nutrients to limit in the diet, including added sugar, sodium, and saturated fat, grain foods
as a category, including enriched/refined grains also provide a range of beneficial nutrients in the
older population, including dietary fiber, calcium, magnesium and B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin,
niacin, cobalamin (B12) and folate) [1,2,9,10]. Similar to all of Americans, fiber is a shortfall nutrient
and nutrient of public health concern in older adults, where only 4% of men and 13% of women had a
dietary fiber intake above the recommended Adequate Intake (AI) level [11]. The Dietary Guidelines
Scientific Advisory Committee has highlighted that calcium intake from foods and beverages did
not meet the EAR for older adults, where 71% of men and 81% of females aged ≥71 years old had
intakes below the EAR. Similarly, dietary folate and magnesium are underconsumed relative to the
Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) in the American population [11]. An analysis using data from
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009–2012 found that percent
of adults below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) increased with age for calcium, folate,
magnesium, vitamin E and vitamin D [12].
As data in all children and adults support grain food contributions to nutrient density in U.S.
dietary patterns and since several nutrients in grains play a distinct role in healthy aging, the objective
of the present analyses was to determine sources of energy and nutrients in all grains, and in commonly
consumed grain foods (i.e., breads, ready-to-eat cereals, etc.) and rank relative to all other foods in U.S.
older adults (≥51 years old) using data from NHANES, 2011–2014.

2. Experimental Section
The NHANES is a nationally-representative, cross-sectional survey of U.S. non-institutionalized,
civilian residents. NHANES data are collected by the National Center for Health Statistics of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Written informed consent was obtained for all participants
or proxies, and the survey protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Board at the National
Center for Health Statistics. Data from two NHANES datasets (2011–2012; 2013–2014) were combined
for the present analyses in adults ≥51 years old [13]. Nutrient intake data for NHANES 2011–2014 are
from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary
Studies (FNDDS) 5.0 and 6.0 [14]. FNDDS are databases that provide the nutrient values for foods and
beverages reported in What We Eat in America (WWEIA), the dietary intake component of NHANES
for each data release. The WWEIA Food Categories provide an application to analyze food and
beverages as consumed in the American diet. The classification scheme includes 150 unique categories
and there are 15 main food groups and 46 subcategories of foods. WWEIA food categories have been
previously published by USDA [15].
In the current analyses, each grain food and all other foods reported in WWEIA/NHANES is
placed in one of the mutually-exclusive food subcategories by linking each food code contained in
FNDDS to one WWEIA category [15]. Mixed grain dishes were separated from the main grains group
as a food subcategory, and were included in the current analyses. In the present analyses, the combined
NHANES dataset sample included 4522 male and female participants, ≥51 years of age, who had
reliable and complete 24-h dietary intake data from WWEIA. Trained individuals complete the 24-h
dietary recalls using USDA’s dietary data collection instrument, the Automated Multiple-Pass Method,
which includes detailed descriptions of all food and amounts consumed by subjects. While two days
of 24-h dietary recalls are collected in WWEIA, the current analysis used Day 1 data as this represents
the in-person data collection in the Mobile Examination Center [16].
Methods and Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (Version 9.2, SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA). SAS PROC SURVEYMEANS was used for all statistical calculations, including
means and percentages. Survey weights were used to generate nationally-representative estimates for
U.S. adults, which were also adjusted for the complex sample design of NHANES. Mean and standard
errors of energy, macronutrients and micronutrients for the daily total diet and from food groups were
determined (nutrients from dietary supplements were not considered). Percentages of total energy
and nutrient intake contributed from food sources were tabulated by ranked order.
3. Results
Food sources of energy and nutrients for main food groups are shown in Tables 1–21, which appear
in this article. Food sources of energy and nutrients for USDA food subcategories are shown in
Supplemental Tables S1–S19 and are available online. All foods are ranked based on energy or nutrient
contribution in the total diet. Only values >1.0% contribution to the total diet are reported so as not to
consider inconsequential sources.
3.1. Main Food Groups and Subcategory Food Groups: Energy Contributions
Energy contribution of main food groups and subcategory of foods groups are presented in
Tables 1 and 2. The greatest main food group contributors of energy in the diet are mixed dishes
(19.3%), snacks and sweets (17.0%), protein foods (16.2%), grains (14.1%) and non-alcoholic beverages
(7.2%) (Table 1). When considering subcategories of food groups, the top five ranking foods for energy
contribution were sweet bakery products (7.8%), breads, rolls, and tortillas (7.6%), plant-based protein
foods (4.4%), alcoholic beverages (4.3%) and grain-based mixed dishes (4.2%). Other grain-based foods
providing ≤5% of energy in the total diet included, sandwiches (3.1%), ready-to-eat cereals (2.4%),

3.3. Subcategory Food Groups: 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans’ Shortfall Nutrients
3.3.1. 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines Nutrients of Public Health Concern: Dietary Fiber, Calcium,
Vitamin D, and Potassium
The top ranking (i.e., ≥10%) subcategory foods, collectively providing 37.4% of dietary fiber to
the total diet, were vegetables, excluding potatoes (13.6%), breads, rolls and tortillas (12.0%) and fruits
(11.7%) (Table S1). When considering calcium, two food groups contributed approximately a quarter of
all calcium in the diet (27.5%) milk (15.7%) and cheese (11.8%) (Table S2). When considering vitamin D
(Table S3), the highest ranking subcategory contributors providing 47.4% of vitamin D in the diet were
milk (30.1%) and seafood (17.4%). While no one food item provided ≥10% of potassium in the total
diet, coffee, vegetables (excluding potatoes), fruits, milk, white potatoes, meat/poultry/fish mixed
dishes, plant-based protein foods, 100% juice, breads, rolls, and tortillas, and poultry were the top ten
ranking contributors, collectively providing 57.3% of all potassium in the diet (Table S4).
3.3.2. 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines Shortfall Nutrients: Folate, Iron, Magnesium, Vitamin A,
Vitamin E, and Vitamin C
Two grain food groups were the two largest contributors (i.e., ≥10%) of dietary folate as Dietary
Folate Equivalents (DFE) providing 34.4% of folate in the diet, namely ready-to-eat cereals (21.0%),
and breads, rolls and tortillas (13.4%) (Table S5). Similarly, ready-to-eat cereals, and breads, rolls,
and tortillas provided nearly one-third of all iron in the total diet (30.8%) (Table S6). While no one
food item provided ≥10% of all magnesium in the total diet, plant-based protein foods, breads, rolls,
and tortillas, coffee and tea, vegetables (excluding potatoes), plain water, milk, fruits, ready-to-eat
cereals, meat/poultry/fish mixed dishes, and grain-based mixed dishes were the top ten ranking
contributors, collectively providing 53.6% of all magnesium in the diet (Table S7). Only vegetables,

excluding potatoes, provided ≥10% of vitamin A in the total diet (21.7%). An additional 47.2% of all
vitamin A in the diet was providing by the following nine foods: milk, ready-to-eat cereals, fats and
oils, eggs, meats, cheese, desserts, meat/poultry/fish mixed dishes, and grain-based mixed dishes
(Table S8). The top ten ranking foods for vitamin E contributed 61.9% (Table S9) of vitamin E in the
diet, however, the category of plant-based protein foods was the only food source to provide ≥10%
of all vitamin E (12.7%). The top three ranking foods for vitamin C (Table S10) provided 65.4% of all
vitamin C in the diet: 100% juice (25.4%), vegetables, excluding potatoes (21.8%), and fruits (18.2%).
3.4. Main Food Groups: Total Fat, Saturated Fat, Added Sugars and Sodium Contributions
Protein foods, mixed dishes, snacks and sweets were the source for nearly 77% of total fat in
the diet (Table 13). Mixed dishes, snacks and sweets, protein foods, milk and dairy, and fats and oils
contributed 88% of all saturated fat in the total diet (Table 14). Two main food groups, non-alcoholic
beverages, and snacks and sweets contributed nearly 66% of added sugars in the diet (Table 15).
The three largest main food group sources of sodium in the total diet were mixed dishes (29.2%),
protein foods (22.7%), and grains (14.1%) (Table 16).

3.5. Subcategory Food Groups: Total Fat, Saturated Fat, Added Sugars and Sodium Contributions
While no one subcategory of food contributed ≥10% of all total fat (Table S11) in the diet, the
top ten food sources collectively provided 56.9% of total fat, with fats and oils and sweet bakery
products being the largest contributors. Likewise, while fats and oils, and sweet bakery products
were the largest contributors of saturated fat (9.5% and 9.2%, respectively), no food item contributed
≥10% of all saturated fat in the diet (Table S12). Two food groups provided nearly half of all added
sugars in the total diet (Table S13)—sweetened beverages (25.0%) and sweet bakery products (17.2%).
Similar to total fat and saturated fat, there was no food group that provided ≥10% of all sodium
in the diet (Table S14). The top ten foods, collectively contributing 53.6% of all sodium in the total
diet, were breads, rolls, and tortillas, cured meats/poultry, meat/poultry/fish mixed dishes, soups,
grain-based mixed dishes, vegetables (excluding potatoes), poultry, condiments and sauces, sandwiches,
and sweet bakery products.
3.6. Main Food Groups: Thiamin, Niacin, Riboflavin, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12
Four main food groups contribute nearly 78% of all thiamin in the diet, with the leading main
food group being grain foods, providing 32.6% of thiamin in the total diet (Table 17). For niacin, the top
three contributors in the diet were protein foods (29.1%), mixed dishes (22.6%) and grains (22.5%),
collectively providing nearly 75% of niacin in the diet (Table 18). The top five contributors of riboflavin,
collectively providing 81.2% of riboflavin were non-alcoholic beverages, grains, milk and dairy, protein
foods, and mixed dishes (Table 19). Protein foods, grains, mixed dishes and vegetables were the
largest contributors of vitamin B6 (72.7%) (Table 20), while protein foods, mixed dishes, milk and dairy,
and grains contributed nearly 90% of all vitamin B12 in the diet (Table 21).

3.7. Subcategory Food Groups: Thiamin, Niacin, Riboflavin, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12
Two grain subcategories (i.e., breads, rolls and tortillas, and ready-to-eat cereals) were the largest
contributors (≥10% for each food) of thiamin in the diet, collectively providing more than a quarter of
thiamin in the total diet (Table S15). Breads, rolls, and tortillas were the only food to provide ≥10%
of niacin in the total diet (Table S16). The top two contributors of riboflavin in the total diet were
coffee and tea, and milk, collectively providing 23.8% of riboflavin in the diet (Table S17). Ready-to-eat
cereals were the sole food subcategory to provide ≥10% of vitamin B6 in the total diet (Table S18),
while meats, ready-to-eat cereals, and milk were the top-ranking subcategory of foods for vitamin B12,
collectively providing 42.0% of all vitamin B12 in the total diet (Table S19).
4. Discussion
Americans of all ages are continuously not meeting nutrition recommendations even as
previous [8] and current dietary guidelines [3] have identified shortfall and nutrients of public health
concern. The current analyses focused on older American adults, as sources of energy and nutrients
in this population remain limited. The present analyses determined the contribution of grain foods
to energy and nutrients in older U.S. adults and ranked other food sources in the American diet, to
provide an assessment of energy and nutrient contribution to the total diet. While all grain foods
contributed 14% of all energy in the total diet, ranking as the 4th largest contributor of energy compared
to 15 main food groups, grain foods can provide nutrient density to the American diet of older adults
given they provide a greater percentage of nutrients than energy to the diet. The grain foods category
ranked 2nd highest of 15 main food groups for daily dietary fiber, iron, folate, and magnesium, the 3rd
largest main food group contributor for daily calcium intake (13 ± 0.4%) and 1st for thiamin and niacin
intake. When evaluating subcategories of foods, breads, rolls and tortillas provided 150 ± 2.8 kcal/day
or 8% of all energy in the total diet, ranking as the 2nd largest contributor of energy compared to
46 food subcategories. The grain subcategory of breads, rolls and tortillas ranked 1st of 46 food
subcategories for daily thiamin and niacin intake and 2nd for dietary fiber, iron, folate, and magnesium.
Breads, rolls and tortillas ranked 3rd largest food subcategory contributor for daily calcium intake.
Ready-to-eat cereals provided 47 ± 2.6 kcal/day or 2% of all energy in the total diet, ranking as the
20th largest contributor of energy compared to 46 food subcategories. All ready-to-eat cereals ranked
1st for daily iron, 1st for folate, 5th for dietary fiber, 3rd for niacin, 8th for magnesium, and 13th for
calcium intake. When considering nutrients to limit as outlined by dietary guidance, main group of
grains contributed 6.27% total fat, 4.58% saturated fat, 14.13% sodium and 8.9% added sugar.
Current and preceding dietary guidance [3,8] for Americans recommend that half of all grains
consumed be whole grains, with limitations placed on refined/enriched grain consumption. This may
be promoting a perception that non-whole grain foods are not a component of a healthy dietary pattern,
due to minimal or less nutrient density and increased caloric intake. The current analysis considered
all foods consumed in the American diet, including all grain foods. Additionally, the current analysis
did not separate whole- and refined-grain foods, as a key objective included determining the sources
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 534
13 of 16
of energy and nutrients from all foods, and grain foods in particular, as currently consumed in the
older American population. As such, the analysis showed that any perceptions that refined grain foods
may be lacking in nutrient density are invalid. Indeed, certain grain foods (i.e., sweet bakery products)
in the total diet can contribute nutrients to limit, including added sugar, sodium, and saturated fat and
hence, these grain foods should be consumed in moderation and within caloric recommendations as
designated by dietary guidance to promote public health. Nonetheless, the entire grain food category
is the first, second, or third ranking category delivering dietary fiber, folate, iron, magnesium, calcium,
and vitamin D—all nutrients identified as shortfall nutrients by the 2015–2020 DGA [3]. Similarly,
further analysis with specific food subcategories within the grain category show that breads, rolls and
tortillas, grain foods routinely consumed in the U.S. diet, are also first, second and/or third ranking
foods for dietary fiber, folate, calcium, iron, magnesium, vitamin A, for less than 8.5% of all calories
and sodium, less than 3% of total fat, less than 2.5% of all saturated fat, and less than 3.5% of all added
sugar in the total diet. Comparably, the current data provide sources of energy and nutrients data in
the older American adult for ready-to-eat cereals, another commonly consumed grain food in the U.S.
Ready-to-eat cereals are first, second, third, fourth, and/or fifth ranking foods for dietary fiber, folate,
iron, vitamin A, vitamin D for less than 2.5% of all calories and sodium, less than 1% of total fat, less
than 0.5% of all saturated fat, and less than 4% of all added sugar in the total diet.
Many older Americans are not meeting recommendations for several key nutrients, many of which
are contributed by grain food products. Thus, maintaining both whole- and refined/enriched grains,
as part of a healthy dietary pattern, may prove to benefit nutrient intakes in a substantial portion of
the U.S. older population. The 2015–2020 DGAs identified shortfall nutrients in all Americans 2 years
of age, however, intake of shortfall nutrients can be even lower in older adults. A recent NHANES
analysis examining food and supplement use in various age groups found significant differences
in the proportion of the population with intakes below EAR. Adults ≥71 years of age had a higher
prevalence of inadequacy for calcium, magnesium, and most B vitamins compared to middle-aged and
younger adults. Overall, when considering food consumption alone, the data showed that older adults
had lower intake and higher prevalence of inadequacy for most nutrients relative to younger adults,
with use of dietary supplements being associated with the greatest benefit in older adults [12]. An Irish
cross-sectional analysis that explored dietary intakes of community-dwelling elderly individuals
found that a substantial number of participants had inadequate intakes of several nutrients, including
calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, folate, zinc and vitamin C [17]. U.S. national surveys of dietary
intake consistently report all Americans, including older adults, do not meet recommendations for
dietary fiber intake [18]. A review by Allen (2009) reported that in the U.S. and the United Kingdom,
approximately 6% of adults ≥60 years of age are vitamin B12 deficient, with prevalence of deficiency
increasing as individuals age [19]. Another cross-sectional study of free-living New York city older
adults participating in the Cardiovascular Health of Seniors and Built Environment Study, found that
both genders fell short on recommended intake for fiber, calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, folate,
and vitamins A, B6, C, D, and E, and in some instances, women had intakes for thiamin below the
recommendations [20]. Similarly, a recent systematic review identified inadequate intake of vitamin
D, thiamin, riboflavin, calcium, magnesium, and selenium in community-dwelling older adults from
North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand [21] population.
The current analyses have a limitation inherent in observational research and has previously
been reported in similar research designs. The results are dependent on self-reported dietary data for
foods, which may involve study participants under- or over-estimating food consumption, leading
to inaccuracies in energy and nutrient intakes. Data were also obtained using a 24-hour dietary
recall, which relies on study participant memory, and while validated methods are used to gather
the data, recall information is subject to inaccuracies and bias from memory challenges and other
potential measurement errors experienced in epidemiological investigations [22]. Caution should
be administered when comparing the current findings to previous studies, as food groupings can
impact sources of energy and nutrient outcomes, specifically where there are differences in the level
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 534
14 of 16
of aggregation (i.e., the number of food groups) or disaggregation methods used by researchers.
A significant benefit of using NHANES data for the current analyses includes access to a large and
nationally-representative dataset of adults of various age groups in the U.S. and corresponding food
and nutrient intake data.
5. Conclusions
Although existing dietary guidance recommends an increase in shortfall nutrients and nutrients
of public health concern, predominantly through food consumption, gaps in nutrient intakes persist in
older U.S. adults. The current sources of energy and nutrients analyses show that cumulatively,
a variety of grain foods, regularly consumed by older American adults, in addition to other
nutrient-dense foods, including fruits and vegetables, help contribute to nutrient density in the
total diet. Specifically, grain foods are contributors (≥10% in the total diet) of the 2015–2020 DGA
under-consumed shortfall nutrients and nutrients of public health concern, including dietary fiber,
folate, magnesium, calcium and iron, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B12, niacin, and thiamin.
The subcategory of breads, rolls and tortillas are contributors of daily thiamin, niacin, dietary
fiber, folate, and iron, while ready-to-eat cereals contribute iron, folate, thiamin, vitamin B6, and
vitamin B12. Based on the current data presented, encouraging certain grain food patterns in older
U.S. adults, including selecting a mix of whole-, enriched- and fortified-grains, from breads, and
cereals, may improve nutrient intakes and minimize gaps in shortfall nutrient intakes. In contrast,
eliminating grains, especially refined grains, from the diet may lead to unintended nutrient intake
consequences. Developing dietary strategies that are mindful of recommended caloric needs, while
monitoring nutrients to limit (i.e., added sugars, sodium and saturated fat) can benefit from the
inclusion of refined/enriched and whole grain selections in the U.S. diet.
