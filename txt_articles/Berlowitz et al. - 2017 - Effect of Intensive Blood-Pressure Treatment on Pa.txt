Abstract
BACKGROUND—The previously published results of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention 
Trial showed that among participants with hypertension and an increased cardiovascular risk, but 
without diabetes, the rates of cardiovascular events were lower among those who were assigned to 
a target systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) than among those 
who were assigned to a target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment). Whether such 
intensive treatment affected patient-reported outcomes was uncertain; those results from the trial 
are reported here.
METHODS—We randomly assigned 9361 participants with hypertension to a systolic blood-
pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg or a target of less than 140 mm Hg. Patient-reported 
outcome measures included the scores on the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental 
Component Summary (MCS) of the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey, the Patient Health 
Questionnaire 9-item depression scale (PHQ-9), patient-reported satisfaction with their blood-
pressure care and blood-pressure medications, and adherence to blood-pressure medications. We 
compared the scores in the intensive-treatment group with those in the standard-treatment group 
among all participants and among participants stratified according to physical and cognitive 
function.
RESULTS—Participants who received intensive treatment received an average of one additional 
anti-hypertensive medication, and the systolic blood pressure was 14.8 mm Hg (95% confidence

 interval, 14.3 to 15.4) lower in the group that received intensive treatment than in the group that 
received standard treatment. Mean PCS, MCS, and PHQ-9 scores were relatively stable over a 
median of 3 years of follow-up, with no significant differences between the two treatment groups. 
No significant differences between the treatment groups were noted when participants were 
stratified according to baseline measures of physical or cognitive function. Satisfaction with 
blood-pressure care was high in both treatment groups, and we found no significant difference in 
adherence to blood-pressure medications.
CONCLUSIONS—Patient-reported outcomes among participants who received intensive 
treatment, which targeted a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, were similar to those 
among participants who received standard treatment, including among participants with decreased 
physical or cognitive function. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; SPRINT 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01206062.)
The systolic blood pressure intervention Trial (SPRINT) showed that among older adults 
with hypertension and a high risk of cardiovascular disease, but without prevalent diabetes 
or a history of stroke, blood-pressure treatment that targeted a systolic blood pressure of less 
than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) led to lower rates of cardiovascular events and death 
than treatment that targeted a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg (standard 
treatment).1 The adoption of the lower blood-pressure target into clinical practice may be 
limited by concerns regarding its effect on patient-reported outcomes, such as health status, 
quality of life, and satisfaction with care.2–4 Although lower rates of cardiovascular events 
associated with intensive treatment could result in improved health status, serious adverse 
events associated with low end-organ perfusion, including symptomatic hypotension, 
syncope, and acute kidney injury, were more common among trial participants who were 
randomly assigned to intensive treatment.1 Reductions in cerebral blood flow, especially 
among older patients who have hypertension as well as physical and cognitive impairment, 
may lead to light-headedness, confusion, and depression.3,5,6 Participants with a target 
systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg received an average of one additional 
antihypertensive medication.1 Antihypertensive medications may have negative effects on 
health-related quality of life.7 Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effect of intensive 
treatment for hypertension, not only on the rates of cardiovascular events and death, but also 
on outcomes that are important to a patient’s perception of well-being and satisfaction.
Using patient-reported outcomes from the trial,1 we sought to address three questions. First, 
did patients randomly assigned to intensive blood-pressure control perceive their health 
status, as measured by patient-reported outcomes of physical and mental health, differently 
from patients randomly assigned to standard treatment? Second, did older patients who had 
hypertension as well as lower physical and cognitive function have different patient-reported 
outcomes depending on whether they were receiving intensive or standard antihypertensive 
treatment? Third, because adverse effects from medications may lead to poor adherence to 
treatment, did intensive treatment affect patient-reported adherence to treatment?

 METHODS
TRIAL DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT
The trial design and primary results have been published previously.1,8 In brief, we 
conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial that compared two strategies for 
managing systolic blood pressure in older adults with hypertension: an intensive strategy 
with a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg versus a standard-care strategy 
targeting a systolic blood-pressure of less than 140 mm Hg. The primary outcome was the 
first occurrence of any component of the composite of myocardial infarction, acute coronary 
syndrome, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular disease. The population 
included participants 50 years of age or older who had a systolic blood pressure between 130 
and 180 mm Hg at the screening visit, with the eligible blood-pressure range varying as a 
function of the number of antihypertensive medications the participants were receiving. 
Participants were considered to have an increased cardiovascular risk if they had clinical or 
subclinical cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or an elevated Framingham risk 
score, or if they were 75 years of age or older. Patients with diabetes mellitus or a history of 
stroke were excluded. Enrollment began in November 2010 and ended in March 2013. A 
total of 9361 participants at 102 clinical sites underwent randomization.
All the components of the trial protocol (which is available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org) were designed and implemented by the steering committee in collaboration with 
the investigators at the clinics, who collected the data. The steering committee vouches for 
the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. The 
writing committee analyzed the data, wrote and revised the manuscript, and, together with 
the steering committee, made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The 
policy of the National Institutes of Health (NIH, the sponsor of the trial) requires the sharing 
of data; although some data from SPRINT were previously made publicly available, it is 
anticipated that the complete results, including those provided in this article, will be 
available through the data repository of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in late 
2018. The trial was approved by the institutional review board at each participating trial site. 
Two of the blood-pressure–lowering medications used in the trial (azilsartan and azilsartan 
combined with chlorthalidone) were donated by both Takeda Pharmaceuticals International 
and Arbor Pharmaceuticals; neither company had any other role in the study.
TRIAL MEASUREMENTS
Patient-reported outcomes were assessed by well-validated measures. The Veterans RAND 
12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) was used to describe physical and mental health-related 
quality of life.9 Scores on the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component 
Summary (MCS) of the VR-12 are standardized with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation 
of 10; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores denoting better physical health and 
mental health, respectively. Depressive symptoms were measured with the use of the Patient 
Health Questionnaire 9-item depression scale (PHQ-9).10 Scores on the PHQ-9 range from 0 
to 27, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms and scores of 10 
or higher suggesting moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Data regarding these 
outcomes were collected at baseline and annually thereafter.

 Patient satisfaction with blood-pressure care and with blood-pressure medications were each 
assessed by means of responses to single questions scored on a five-point Likert scale that 
ranged from very satisfied to very dissatisfied. Adherence to medication was measured with 
the use of the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale; scores range from 0 to 8, 
with higher scores indicating better adherence. It has been suggested that a 2-point change 
over time on the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale represents a meaningful change in 
adherence to antihypertensive medication.11,12 Data on satisfaction with treatment and on 
adherence to medication were collected at baseline, 12 months, and 48 months. Participants 
who were not receiving antihypertensive medications at the time of assessment did not 
respond to the questions regarding satisfaction with medications and medication adherence.
We continued to collect data on patient-reported outcomes in our trial after the onset of 
nonfatal trial end points. The current analyses include data that were collected through 
August 20, 2015. On that date, the director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 
accepted a recommendation from the data and safety monitoring board to inform the 
investigators and participants of the cardiovascular-outcome results after analyses of the 
primary outcome exceeded the monitoring boundary at two consecutive time points, thus 
initiating the process to end the blood-pressure intervention early.1 Because of the early 
termination of the intervention, only limited data on patient satisfaction and adherence to 
medication were available at 48 months; those data are not included in the current analyses.
Outcomes in the standard-treatment group and the intensive-treatment group were compared 
in unstratified analyses as well as after stratification according to physical and cognitive 
function at baseline. Stratification according to the number of physical coexisting conditions 
at baseline and according to health-related quality of life at baseline (lower vs. higher) was 
prespecified in the trial protocol. Lower physical function was operationalized as a score of 
less than 40 on the PCS. Coexisting conditions were reported by the participants with the 
use of the Selim comorbidity index, which assesses 30 medical conditions and 6 mental 
health conditions.13 The physical score on the Selim comorbidity index was calculated as 
the sum of the number of these 30 possible medical conditions reported, and the mental 
score was the sum of the number of these 6 possible mental health conditions reported. In 
exploratory analyses, we also considered additional stratifications according to age (<75 
years vs. ≥75 years), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score (<25th percentile vs. 
≥25th percentile, on the basis of normative data specific to age, educational level, and race 
from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores 
indicating better cognitive performance),14,15 and frailty status, which was based on a 36-
item frailty index that aggregates information on coexisting conditions, laboratory test 
results, cognitive status, physical functioning, and health status. Frailty index scores range 
from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating greater frailty.16
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Baseline characteristics were analyzed as means and standard deviations or medians and 
inter-quartile ranges for continuous variables and as frequency distributions for categorical 
variables. Differences at baseline were examined with the use of Student’s t-test or the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test as appropriate for continuous variables and with the use of the chi-

 square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Linear mixed models were used to 
compare longitudinal trajectories for each of the patient-reported outcomes between the two 
treatment groups, assuming linear change over time (see Supplementary Methods in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). The models included participant-specific 
and clinic-specific random effects to address within-participant correlations as a result of 
repeated assessments and correlations among participants at the same trial site. Fixed effects 
in the model included treatment group, follow-up time, and the interaction between 
treatment group and follow-up time. For each outcome, we also tested for interactions 
between treatment group and subgroups that were defined according to the number of 
medical coexisting conditions, the number of mental health coexisting conditions, PCS score 
(lower vs. higher), age, MoCA score, and frailty status. We also conducted sensitivity 
analyses using multiple imputation to examine the effect of missing data (see Supplementary 
Methods in the Supplementary Appendix). The analyses were performed with the use of 
SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), or the R statistical computing environment.17 All 
the hypothesis tests were two-sided, and P values of less than 0.05 were considered to 
indicate statistical significance. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made.
RESULTS
TRIAL PARTICIPANTS
We randomly assigned 9361 participants to receive either intensive treatment (4678 
participants) or standard treatment (4683 participants). Completion rates for the VR-12 PCS 
assessment were 99.6% at baseline, 92.0% at 12 months, and remained above 87% for the 
remaining follow-up visits (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The mean (±SD) 
PCS score at baseline was 44.7±10.3, and the mean MCS score was 53.1±9.6. The mean 
PHQ-9 score was 3.1±4.2. Overall, 85.0% of the participants were satisfied or very satisfied 
with their blood-pressure care at baseline. Among the participants who were receiving 
blood-pressure medications at baseline, 76.2% were satisfied or very satisfied with their 
medications, and 38.2% reported high adherence (Morisky Medication Adherence Scale 
score of 8). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups at 
baseline with respect to a broad range of measures of coexisting conditions, physical 
function, and mental function (Table 1, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
mean systolic blood pressure at baseline was 139.7±15.6 mm Hg, and the mean was similar 
in the two groups. At 1 year after randomization, the mean systolic blood pressure was 136.2 
mm Hg in the standard-treatment group and 121.4 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group, 
a difference of 14.8 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.3 to 15.4).
PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES
Despite the difference between the two groups in achieved blood pressure, the mean PCS, 
MCS, and PHQ-9 scores were relatively stable over the course of follow-up, with no 
significant differences between the treatment groups (Fig. 1). Assuming linear change over 
time, the mean PCS scores decreased slightly over the course of follow-up in both the 
intensive-treatment group (−0.23 points per year; 95% CI, −0.31 to −0.16) and the standard-
treatment group (−0.23 points per year; 95% CI, −0.31 to −0.15) (P = 0.90) (Tables S3 
through S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The mean MCS scores increased slightly over

 time in both the intensive-treatment group (0.15 points per year; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.24) and 
the standard-treatment group (0.14 points per year; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.22) (P = 0.79). The 
mean PHQ-9 scores decreased slightly over the course of follow-up, with a mean change of 
−0.03 points per year (95% CI, −0.06 to 0) in the intensive-treatment group and −0.03 points 
per year (95% CI, −0.07 to 0) in the standard-treatment group (P = 0.86). The inclusion of 
additional follow-up data on patient-reported outcomes through December 1, 2015, did not 
alter the conclusions of the trial. Similarly, the censoring of data from participants at the 
time of an outcome event did not alter the trial conclusions (Tables S6 through S11 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
At baseline, lower mean PCS and MCS scores were associated with higher numbers of 
medical coexisting conditions (Fig. 2). No significant differences between the intensive-
treatment group and the standard-treatment group over time were observed when 
participants were stratified according to the number of medical coexisting conditions. 
Overall, 28.2% of trial participants were 75 years of age or older. These participants had 
worse PCS scores but better MCS scores at baseline than did younger participants (Fig. 3). 
No significant differences between the intensive-treatment group and the standard-treatment 
group were noted over time within each of the two age strata. Similar results were noted 
when participants were stratified according to additional baseline measures of physical and 
cognitive function, including the number of mental health coexisting conditions, baseline 
PCS score (≥40 vs. <40), MoCA score (≥25th percentile vs. <25th percentile), and the frailty 
index score, with no significant interactions among these subgroups (Figs. S1 through S4 
and Tables S3 through S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Sensitivity analyses based on 
multiple imputation, under the assumption that missing data occurred at random, did not 
change the results appreciably (Table S12 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
At 12 months, small but significant differences were observed between the intensive-
treatment group and the standard-treatment group with respect to the participants’ level of 
satisfaction with their blood-pressure care (P= 0.03) (Table 2). Despite these differences, a 
majority of participants in each group reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with 
their blood-pressure care (88.6% in the intensive-treatment group and 88.2% in the standard-
treatment group), and the percentage of participants who described an improvement in 
satisfaction from baseline was similar in the two groups (35.0% and 33.7%, respectively; P = 
0.18). Small but significant differences between the two groups were noted with respect to 
satisfaction with the medications received for blood pressure; 62.1% of participants in the 
intensive-treatment group and 57.7% of participants in the standard-treatment group 
reported being very satisfied with the medications they received. Overall, 44.4% of 
participants reported high adherence to blood-pressure medications at 12 months, and no 
significant differences were noted between the two treatment groups with respect to 
medication adherence.
DISCUSSION
Randomization to intensive blood-pressure control had little effect on changes in patient-
reported outcomes and adherence to blood-pressure medication. Thus, the benefits seen with 
the intensive blood-pressure intervention with respect to cardiovascular events and death1

 were not accompanied by worse physical function, mental function, or depressive 
symptoms, as perceived by the participants. In fact, satisfaction with both blood-pressure 
care and blood-pressure medication at 12 months was significantly higher among 
participants who received intensive treatment, although the differences between the two 
treatment groups were small.
We evaluated well-validated patient-reported outcomes that captured physical and mental 
health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, and adherence to blood-pressure 
medication. We found that the two treatment groups did not differ significantly over a 
median period of 3 years of follow-up with respect to VR-12 and PHQ-9 scores or at 1 year 
with respect to scores on the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Moreover, we observed 
only small changes in the mean scores over time in both groups. On average, the mean PCS, 
MCS, and PHQ-9 scores changed less than 1 unit by the time of the 1-year follow-up visit; 
these differences were not considered to be clinically relevant.18–20
We hypothesized that intensive treatment might have adverse effects on patient-reported 
outcomes, despite the fact that it resulted in lower rates of cardiovascular events and death 
than those with standard treatment. Although decreased perfusion resulting from intensive 
treatment could affect a variety of organs, particular concern has been expressed that mean 
arterial blood pressure among patients receiving intensive antihypertensive treatment, 
especially among older patients with a widened pulse pressure, may be too low to maintain 
adequate cerebral perfusion.3 However, some studies have suggest-ed that long-term 
antihypertensive treatment results in increased cerebral blood flow, preserved autoregulation, 
and a reduction in orthostatic hypotension among older persons with hypertension.21–23
Intensive treatment typically results in the use of additional medications. Such medications 
could be associated with both physical and mental side effects. Antihypertensive 
medications that have been in use for decades, such as methyldopa, reserpine, and 
propranolol, have been associated with a diminished perception of quality of life.7 Studies of 
newer antihypertensive medications, however, have often shown little effect on health-
related quality of life. In the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study, the combination of 
lifestyle modifications plus medications was associated with greater improvements in health-
related quality of life than lifestyle modifications plus placebo.24 The Action to Control 
Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, which, similar to our trial, compared 
intensive treatment with standard treatment, showed no significant differences between the 
groups with respect to the PHQ-9 scores and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-
Form Health Survey (SF-36) MCS scores.25 Although the PCS score in the ACCORD study 
was significantly lower with intensive treatment than with standard treatment, the 0.6-point 
difference was not considered to be clinically meaningful.
Controversy exists surrounding the benefits and risks of antihypertensive treatment in older 
patients and in patients with physical and cognitive impairment.26,27 Observational studies 
have suggested that impaired physical and cognitive function moderates the association 
between high blood pressure and adverse outcomes.28,29 However, subsequent analyses from 
our trial have shown that among participants 75 years of age or older, the benefits of 
intensive treatment over standard treatment in lowering the rates of cardiovascular events

 and death were similar across frailty and gait-speed subgroups.30 We now show that, on the 
basis of patient-reported outcomes, intensive treatment was associated with few side effects 
across the spectrum of physical and cognitive function included in our trial.
Our trial compared two different systolic blood-pressure targets rather than achieved blood 
pressure. Although a mean difference of 14.8 mm Hg was achieved, some participants had 
unacceptable side effects with a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg. As 
part of our protocol, medications could have been tapered in participants in whom 
unacceptable symptoms developed. This finding emphasizes the need for clinicians to 
actively manage treatment for individual patients to maximize patient-reported health status 
while reducing a patient’s risk of cardiovascular events and death.
Our trial has several limitations. First, the greatest negative effect of intensive treatment on 
patient-reported outcomes could have occurred during the first several months of treatment 
intensification, in which case we would have missed such a transient effect. Second, because 
of the early termination of our trial, long-term follow-up was lacking for many participants, 
particularly with respect to satisfaction with blood-pressure care and adherence to blood-
pressure medications. However, additional data on patient-reported outcomes collected over 
the course of an additional 4 months of follow-up did not alter the conclusions of the trial. 
Third, although our trial was successful in recruiting patients with hypertension who were at 
increased risk for cardiovascular events, questions could be raised regarding external 
validity. Yet it has been estimated that 16.8 million U.S. adults meet the eligibility 
requirements for our trial.31 Finally, the participants in our trial were aware of the treatment 
group to which they had been randomly assigned; knowledge regarding their treatment 
might have affected their perceptions of health.
The management of hypertension has been a major public health success; in large, integrated 
health care systems, blood-pressure control to a target of less than 140/90 mm Hg has been 
reported to be achieved in up to 80% of patients with hypertension.32,33 Translating the 
current findings into clinical practice presents a challenge and would result in changes in 
how clinicians manage hypertension in older patients.34 Before patients and clinicians adopt 
such changes, they will need to be reassured that intensive treatment not only reduces the 
risk of cardiovascular events and death, but will result in few side effects as shown in 
patient-reported assessments. The current results provide complementary evidence that 
supports the main findings of our trial.

 Figure 1. Patient-Reported Outcomes in the Two Treatment Groups over Time
The data points represent the estimated mean based on a linear mixed model; I bars denote 
95% confidence intervals. The values below each graph indicate the number of participants 
assessed at each trial visit. Scores on the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental 
Component Summary (MCS) of the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12) are 
standardized with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10; scores range from 0 to 100, 
with higher scores denoting better physical health and mental health, respectively. Scores on 
the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item depression scale (PHQ-9) range from 0 to 27, with 
higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms and scores of 10 or higher 
suggesting moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms.

 Figure 2. Scores on the VR-12 over Time, According to Treatment Group and Number of 
Medical Coexisting Conditions
The burden of medical coexisting conditions was categorized as 2 or fewer, 3 or 4, 5 or 6, or 
7 or more. The data points represent the estimated mean based on a linear mixed model, 
with I bars denoting 95% confidence intervals. The values below each graph indicate the 
number of participants assessed at each trial visit, according to the number of coexisting 
conditions participants had at baseline. Coexisting conditions were reported by the 
participants with the use of the Selim comorbidity index, which assesses 30 medical 
conditions and 6 mental health conditions. The physical score on the Selim comorbidity 
index was calculated as the sum of the number of these 30 possible medical conditions 
reported, and the mental score was the sum of the number of these 6 possible mental health 
conditions reported.
