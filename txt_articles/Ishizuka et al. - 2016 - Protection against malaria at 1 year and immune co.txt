In 2015 there were an estimated 214 million clinical cases and 
 
438,000 deaths due to malaria1, primarily caused by Pf in children 
in sub-Saharan Africa. A highly effective vaccine is urgently needed 
 
to prevent malaria in individuals and to facilitate elimination of 
malaria from defined geographic areas. To achieve these goals, 
 
we established an interim target of >85% sterile protection against 
 
Pf infection for >6 months2.
There is currently no malaria subunit vaccine that approaches this 
level of protection. The most extensively studied candidate malaria 
vaccine, RTS,S (a subunit vaccine based on the Pf circumsporozoite 
protein (PfCSP)), confers sterilizing protection against controlled 
human malaria infection (CHMI) in about 22% of healthy malaria-
naive adults 5 months after vaccination3. In a phase 3 field study, 
the efficacy of RTS,S against clinical malaria was 26% and 36% in 
young infants and children between the ages of 5 and 17 months, 
respectively, through 38–48 months of follow-up following a four-
dose regimen on a 0-, 1-, 2-, and 20-month schedule4. Therefore, it is 
necessary to investigate alternative vaccination strategies that confer 
long-lived sterilizing protection5,6.
Sustained sterilizing immunity against the pre-erythrocytic 
 
stages of Pf has been observed in humans immunized by whole-
parasite approaches using mosquitoes for vaccination7,8. In a study

An attenuated Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ) vaccine, PfSPZ Vaccine, is highly protective against controlled 
human malaria infection (CHMI) 3 weeks after immunization, but the durability of protection is unknown. We assessed  
how vaccine dosage, regimen, and route of administration affected durable protection in malaria-naive adults. After four 
intravenous immunizations with 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ, 6/11 (55%) vaccinated subjects remained without parasitemia following 
CHMI 21 weeks after immunization. Five non-parasitemic subjects from this dosage group underwent repeat CHMI at 59 weeks, 
and none developed parasitemia. Although Pf-specific serum antibody levels correlated with protection up to 21–25 weeks after 
immunization, antibody levels waned substantially by 59 weeks. Pf-specific T cell responses also declined in blood by 59 weeks. 
To determine whether T cell responses in blood reflected responses in liver, we vaccinated nonhuman primates with PfSPZ 
Vaccine. Pf-specific interferon-g-producing CD8 T cells were present at ~100-fold higher frequencies in liver than in blood.  
Our findings suggest that PfSPZ Vaccine conferred durable protection to malaria through long-lived tissue-resident T cells  
and that administration of higher doses may further enhance protection.

of malaria-naive adults, 5/6 subjects exposed to >1000 irradiated 
mosquitoes carrying attenuated PfSPZ were protected when CHMI 
occurred 23–42 weeks after immunization8. To advance from using 
mosquitoes for inoculation of attenuated PfSPZ toward a clinical 
product, we previously reported that immunization by intravenous 
(i.v.) injection of radiation-attenuated, aseptic, purified, cryopre-
served PfSPZ, a product called Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine9 (hereafter 
referred to as PfSPZ Vaccine), was well tolerated and immunogenic 
(the VRC 312 study)10,11. PfSPZ Vaccine induced a dose-dependent 
increase in PfSPZ-specific antibodies and frequencies of multifunc-
tional TH1 cytokine–producing CD4 T cells and γδ T cells in the 
blood. For vaccine recipients that underwent CHMI 3 weeks after final 
immunization, Pf parasitemia was observed in 3/9 and 0/6 subjects 
 
who received four or five doses of 1.35 × 105 PfSPZ, respectively, 
whereas parasitemia was observed in 5/6 unvaccinated controls, 
 
demonstrating that PfSPZ Vaccine confers high-level, short-term 
protection. The next critical milestones for PfSPZ Vaccine were to 
assess the durability of vaccine efficacy and to investigate the immune 
correlates and mechanisms of protection.
RESULTS
PfSPZ Vaccine efficacy at 21 weeks
To assess the durability of protection, subjects from the VRC 312 
study were re-enrolled for repeat CHMI with the homologous 
 
Pf clone 3D7. Because vaccine efficacy (VE) is assessed at multiple 
 
time points in the same vaccinated subjects, we defined vaccine 
efficacy as first VE (VE at first CHMI), subgroup VE (VE among 
the subgroup of subjects who were not parasitemic after the first 
CHMI and returned for repeat CHMI), and cumulative VE (first VE 
× subgroup VE). VE is calculated as ‘1 − relative risk’, where relative 
risk is the ratio of the infection rate among the vaccinated subjects 
divided by the infection rate among the controls. Thus, VE is always 
adjusted to account for those cases in which the infection rate in the 
controls is not 100%.
Six subjects who had received four or five doses of 1.35 × 105 PfSPZ 
by i.v. injection and had not developed parasitemia following CHMI 
at 3 weeks14 underwent repeat CHMI 21 weeks after the final vac-
cination. Four of six subjects developed parasitemia, as compared to 
6/6 unvaccinated control subjects (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b), for a 
subgroup VE of 33% (P = 0.23). For this dosage group, the first VE 
 
was 76% (ref. 11), and therefore the cumulative VE was 25%. 
 
Thus, 1.35 × 105 PfSPZ administered four or five times did not confer 
adequate protection at 21 weeks.
Additionally, eight subjects in the VRC 312 study who were 
 
parasitemic at a prior CHMI (six immunized subjects and two 
 
unvaccinated controls) underwent repeat CHMI, and all of them 
developed parasitemia (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). Thus, a single 
previous episode of Pf parasitemia followed by drug treatment did not 
confer protection to a subsequent CHMI. Therefore, only vaccinated 
subjects who did not develop parasitemia following their first CHMI 
underwent repeat CHMI in the following studies.
Study design
We assessed in a new study (VRC 314) whether increasing the dosage 
of PfSPZ Vaccine from 1.35 × 105 to 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ per dose affected 
VE. With this higher dose, we tested three-dose (group 1) and four-
dose (groups 4 and 5) regimens. A fourth group of subjects received 
1.35 × 105 PfSPZ four times, followed by a fifth dose of 4.5 × 105 PfSPZ 
(group 3), to determine whether a higher final dose improved VE, as 
compared to that for subjects who received five doses of 1.35 × 105  
PfSPZ (Fig. 1a). For the subjects in each of these groups, PfSPZ 
Vaccine was administered by rapid i.v. injection.
The trial also assessed route of administration. Studies in nonhuman 
primates (NHPs) and humans show that i.v. administration of PfSPZ 
Vaccine is substantially more immunogenic and protective than subcu-
taneous (s.c.) or intradermal (i.d.) administration at a dose of 1.35 × 105 
 
PfSPZ10,11. However, studies in rodents show that intramuscular (i.m.) 
administration of radiation-attenuated SPZs is more protective than 
s.c. or i.d. administration, although it is considerably less protective 
than by i.v. administration12,13. Because there may be instances in 
which administration by i.v. injection is logistically complex, we com-
pared the protective efficacy of administering 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ by i.v. 
injection versus 2.2 × 106 PfSPZ by the i.m. route (an 8.1-fold higher 
dose) with the same four-dose regimen (group 2) (Fig. 1a).
For the primary efficacy analysis, the results are presented for the first 
CHMI for each vaccine group as compared to those for the controls. 
 
To account for multiple comparisons, P < 0.01 was taken as evidence 
of an effect, and P values between 0.01–0.05 were considered to be 
suggestive of an effect. This threshold for significance of the primary 
analysis was specified in the protocol to balance the potential for type 1 
 
error with the conservative Bonferroni approach (Online Methods). 
Secondary analyses compared the results from the different groups, as 
well as describe the results of repeated challenges among those subjects 
 
who remained parasite free in each group. No formal multiple- 
comparison adjustment was used for secondary end points.
Daily monitoring by PCR analysis, rather than thick blood smear, 
was used for diagnosis of parasitemia and treatment. In subjects of 
the VRC 312 cohort, PCR analysis allowed detection of parasitemia 
1–2 d earlier than by blood smear (Supplementary Table 1), which 
enabled clinical monitoring criteria to be changed from overnight 
stays after day 7 to once-daily outpatient visits.
Study population
Of the 101 subjects who were enrolled, 57 were vaccine recipients, 
 
32 were CHMI controls, and 12 were backup controls (Supplementary 
Fig. 2). Baseline demographic characteristics are shown in 
Supplementary Table 2. 55/57 (96%) subjects completed all scheduled 
vaccinations and, cumulatively, 224 vaccinations were administered. In 
total, 52/55 subjects (95%) who completed their vaccinations under-
went at least one CHMI. For CHMIs occurring 3 weeks, 21–25 weeks, 
and 59 weeks after the final vaccination, there were 39, 31, and 5 par-
ticipating vaccine recipients, respectively (Supplementary Table 3).
Adverse events
Vaccinations were well tolerated. Of 57 vaccine recipients, 41 (72%) 
 
had no solicited adverse events at the injection site after any 
 
vaccination, 15 (26%) had mild symptoms, and one (2%) had 
 
moderate symptoms (Supplementary Table 4). There were no solic-
ited systemic symptoms for 32 (56%) vaccine recipients, mild ones 
for 19 (33%) recipients, and moderate ones for six (11%) recipients 
(Supplementary Table 5). There were no serious adverse events 
attributed to vaccination. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels 
measured 14 d after each vaccination were not elevated in any dos-
age group, as compared to those for the same subjects before starting 
the vaccinations (Supplementary Fig. 3).

parasitemia after CHMI, as compared to parasitemia in 7/8 control 
subjects (Fig. 1b). In group 4 (4 doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ), 2/9 vac-
cinated subjects, as compared to 5/6 controls, developed parasitemia 
(Fig. 1c). First VE was estimated to be 62% for group 3 (P = 0.025), 
24% for group 1 (P = 0.34), and 73% for group 4 (P = 0.035).
VE at 21–25 weeks, by i.v. administration. Only vaccine recipients 
who did not develop parasitemia after their first CHMI underwent 
repeat CHMI. Seven subjects from group 3 (four doses of 1.35 × 105 
PfSPZ and a fifth dose of 4.5 × 105 PfSPZ) underwent repeat CHMI 
at 25 weeks after final vaccination, and 3/7, as compared to 6/6 con-
trols, developed parasitemia. Subgroup VE was 57%, and cumula-
tive VE was 35% (Fig. 1d). These results were similar to the results 
from the VRC 312 study for CHMI that was performed at 21 weeks 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, increasing the final dose by 3.3-fold 
did not improve short- or long-term protection, as compared to that 
with the five-dose regimen of 1.35 × 105 PfSPZ11. Three subjects in 
group 1 (three doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ) underwent repeat CHMI at 
25 weeks, and 1/3 developed parasitemia (Fig. 1d); subgroup VE was 
estimated at 67%, and cumulative VE was 16%.
Four subjects in group 4 (four doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ) underwent 
repeat CHMI at 24 weeks. 1/4 vaccinated, and 6/6 control, subjects 
developed parasitemia (Fig. 1e), resulting in a subgroup VE of 75% 
and cumulative VE of 55%. A second group of subjects who received 
four doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ (group 5) underwent their first CHMI 
 
at 21 weeks. Five of these 11 vaccinated subjects developed para-
sitemia, resulting in a first VE of 55% (P = 0.037; Fig. 1e).
VE at 59 weeks, by i.v. administration. Five subjects who received 
four doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ, each of whom had undergone a 
 
single prior CHMI and had not developed parasitemia, underwent 
a second CHMI 59 weeks after the final immunization. 0/5 vaccine 
recipients and 5/6 controls developed parasitemia (P = 0.013; Fig. 1f). 
 
Subgroup VE was 100%, and estimated cumulative VE was 55%, 
 
at 59 weeks (Fig. 1g).
VE at 3 and 25 weeks, by i.m. administration. 5/8 subjects from 
group 2 (i.m. vaccination with 2.2 × 106 PfSPZ) developed parasitemia 
following CHMI 3 weeks after vaccination, resulting in a first VE of 
29% (Fig. 1b). The three subjects who did not develop parasitemia at 
 
3 weeks underwent repeat CHMI at 25 weeks, and all of them devel-
oped parasitemia (Fig. 1d). Thus, PfSPZ administered by i.m. injec-
tion, even at an 8.1-fold higher dose, was less efficient in inducing 
protection than by i.v. administration (8/8 parasitemic in group 2 
through CHMI at 21–25 weeks versus 5/11 in group 5; P = 0.018).

ated SPZs can limit parasites from infecting hepatocytes in animals14–16.

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and automated 
immunofluorescence assays (aIFAs), respectively, 2 weeks after the 
final vaccination. There were no differences in antibody levels among 
the groups that received the different i.v. regimens. However, subjects 
immunized by the i.m. route had lower antibody responses than did 
subjects immunized by i.v. injection (Fig. 2a,b).
Cellular responses. Cellular immunity is critical for protective effi-
cacy by vaccination with live-attenuated SPZs in rodent and NHP 
models10,17–19. Although interferon (IFN)-γ-producing CD8 T cells 
are necessary and sufficient for protection in the majority of mouse 
and NHP studies20, NK, γδ, and CD4 T cells also influence protec-
tion19,21. Pf-specificity was determined by stimulating peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with PfSPZ Vaccine (for CD4 T cell 
responses) or with Pf-infected erythrocytes (PfRBC) (for CD8 T cell 
 
responses) (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary 
Table 6). There is considerable overlap in the proteomes of PfSPZ 
and PfRBC. Although there was an increase in PfSPZ-specific CD4 
T cell cytokine responses after the final immunization in subjects 
from groups 1, 2, 4, and 5, there were no differences between the vac-
cine groups (including the i.m. group) in the magnitude (Fig. 2c) or 
quality of PfSPZ-specific CD4 cytokine responses (Supplementary 
Fig. 6). The PfRBC-specific CD8 T cells in blood 2 weeks after the 
final immunization were no different from those observed before 
administration of the vaccine (background) in most vaccine groups 
(Fig. 2d). Finally, there was a vaccine-induced increase in the fre-
quency of total γδ T cells, but no differences between the groups 
(Fig. 2e,f). The expansion was restricted to the Vγ9+Vδ2+ family 
(hereafter referred to as Vδ2+), which comprises ~75% of γδ T cells 
 
in blood (Supplementary Fig. 7a–f). A higher percentage of γδ  
T cells expressed the activation markers CD38, the cytotoxic molecule 
perforin, and the liver-homing chemokine receptor CXCR6 (ref. 22) 
after vaccination (Supplementary Fig. 7g–l). Of note, γδ T cells from 
PBMCs analyzed before vaccination expressed IFN-γ when stimulated 
ex vivo with live-attenuated PfSPZ (Supplementary Fig. 7m).
Immune correlates
To identify potential immune correlates of protection23, we assessed 
whether there were associations between the immune responses 
measured 2 weeks after the last immunization and the outcome after 
each CHMI (parasitemia versus no parasitemia).
Antibody correlates. PfCSP- and PfSPZ-specific antibody levels 
 
correlated with outcome for CHMIs that were done 3 weeks and 
 
21–25 weeks after the final immunization (Fig. 3a,b). For this analysis, 
we assumed that subjects who developed parasitemia after the 3-week 
 
CHMI would also develop parasitemia after the 21- to 25-week CHMI, 
on the basis of our earlier findings (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Cellular correlates. The percentage of Pf-specific CD4 and CD8 
T cells in the blood that produced IFN-γ, IL-2 and/or TNF-α did not 
correlate with outcome at the 3-week or the 21- to 25-week CHMI 
(Supplementary Fig. 8). However, the absolute frequency of unstimu-
lated Vδ2+ T cells as a percentage of total lymphocytes correlated with 
outcome at the 21- to 25-week CHMI (Fig. 3c). Notably, the frequency

of the Vδ2+ T cell subset measured before the first vaccination also 
correlated with outcome at the 3-week CHMI and the 21- to 25-week 
CHMI (Fig. 3d).
Role of PfSPZ antibodies in protection
The finding that PfCSP- and PfSPZ-specific antibody levels 2 weeks 
after the final immunization correlated with outcome of the 3-week 
and 21- to 25-week CHMIs suggested that antibodies were a biomar-
ker of a successful vaccine response; however, antibodies could also 
have a functional role in mediating protection14–16. To investigate 
this we assessed the levels of antibodies at the times of the 21- to 
 
25-week CHMIs and the 59-week CHMIs. At 59 weeks, PfCSP-specific 
 
antibody levels in the five subjects who did not develop parasitemia 
were 8-fold lower (PfCSP geometric mean (GM) = 1,640) than 
the responses among subjects who did not develop parasitemia at 
 
3 weeks (PfCSP GM = 13,200; P = 0.0051; Fig. 4a). Of note, the 
 
levels of antibodies to PfCSP in the five subjects at 59 weeks (PfCSP 
GM = 1,640) were no different than those in subjects immunized with 
the same regimen and who developed parasitemia following CHMI 
at 21–24 weeks (PfCSP GM = 1,860; P = 0.87; Fig. 4a). Assessment of 
antibody responses to whole PfSPZ (Fig. 4b) also revealed a decline 
in Pf-specific antibody levels over time.
To assess the in vivo functional activity of Pf-specific antibodies, 
we used Fah–/–Rag2–/–Il2rg–/– (FRG) mice (which are deficient in 
T cells, B cell, and NK cells) reconstituted with human hepatocytes 
(which we refer to as FRG-huHep mice), which are capable of sup-
porting liver-stage development of Pf (ref. 24). Total IgG from the five 
 
vaccine recipients that did not develop parasitemia following CHMI at 
59 weeks was purified from plasma and serum. The IgG was passively 
transferred to FRG-huHep mice, and each mouse was challenged 
 
by exposure to 50 mosquitoes infected with luciferase-expressing 
PfSPZ. Liver-stage burden was quantified by whole-animal imaging. 
The negative control consisted of pooled IgG obtained from the blood 
of the five subjects before vaccination. Passive transfer of 150 µg of 
the PfCSP-specific monoclonal antibody 3C1, which was used as the 
positive control, reduced liver-stage burden by ~90% as compared to 
that by transfer of the negative control. Purified IgG from the five vac-
cinated subjects taken 2–3 weeks after vaccination reduced liver-stage 
burden by 88% (median), and IgG taken at 59 weeks after the final 
immunization reduced liver-stage burden by 65% (median) (Fig. 4c). 
There was higher inhibitory activity in IgG taken at 2–3 weeks from 
4/5 subjects as compared to that taken at 59 weeks, but the difference 
did not reach the level of statistical significance (P > 0.05 by Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test). However, liver-stage burden did correlate inversely 
with anti-PfCSP levels (Fig. 4d).
PfSPZ-specific T cell activation is dependent on the timing of CHMI
To provide additional insight into the potential mechanisms of protec-
tion, we assessed how CHMI affected PfSPZ-specific T cell responses 
in vivo after each CHMI. For this analysis, we identified PfSPZ-specific 
 
T cells by the expression of IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-2, and tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α that was induced by ex vivo stimulation 
with PfSPZ antigens, and we simultaneously measured the expression 
of Ki-67 (a marker used to detect recent lymphocyte cell division25; 
Fig. 5a). One week after the subjects in the VRC 312 (Fig. 5b) and 
VRC 314 (Fig. 5e) clinical trials received their final immunizations, 
~20–30% of PfSPZ-specific CD4 T cells were Ki-67+, demonstrating 
that vaccination induced T cell division. Ki-67 was only detected in 
PfSPZ-specific CD4 T cells and not in total memory CD4 T cells 
(Fig. 5b–h), providing evidence for PfSPZ specificity. One to two 
weeks following the 3-week CHMI, Ki-67 was detected in ~40–60% 
of PfSPZ-specific CD4 T cells from subjects with parasitemia (both 
vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects), showing that malaria infection 
was associated with activation of a high proportion of PfSPZ-specific

CD4 T cells (Fig. 5c,d). In contrast, there were low to undetectable 
numbers of Ki-67+ PfSPZ-specific CD4 T cells in PBMCs from the 25 
subjects in the VRC 312 (n = 12; Fig. 5c) and VRC 314 (n = 13; Fig. 5f) 
studies who did not develop parasitemia after the 3-week CHMI. One 
to two weeks after the 21- to 25-week and 59-week CHMIs, ~10–20% 
of PfSPZ-specific CD4 T cells from the subjects who did not develop 
parasitemia were Ki-67+ (Fig. 5d,g,h), as compared to the 0–1%  
of PfSPZ-specific CD4 T cells that were present on the day of the 
CHMI. These data suggest that there was differential antigen exposure 
in vivo when CHMI was done at 3 weeks versus 21–25 or 59 weeks 
among subjects who remained without parasitemia. The percent-
age of Pf-specific CD4, CD8, or γδ T cells in blood did not change 
after CHMI at any time in subjects who did not have parasitemia 
(Supplementary Fig. 9a–f), nor did PfCSP-specific antibody levels 
(Supplementary Fig. 9g).
Tissue distribution of Pf-specific T cells
The low amount of Pf-specific antibody at 59 weeks for all five 
 
vaccinated subjects who were not parasitemic after CHMI (Fig. 4a,b) 
 
suggested that antibodies did not probably have a major role in 
 
mediating protection at this time point. Therefore, PfSPZ-specific 
 
T cell responses were assessed in blood throughout the course of 
 
vaccination and following each CHMI.
Longitudinal cellular responses in humans. In PBMCs, cytokine-
producing PfSPZ-specific CD4 T cell responses declined significantly 
over the course of 59 weeks in vaccinated subjects who remained 
without parasitemia (P = 0.047; Fig. 6a), and cytokine-producing 
PfRBC-specific CD8 T cell responses were induced by vaccina-
tion; however, they returned to pre-vaccine levels shortly after the 
 
final vaccination (Fig. 6b). Thus, neither antibodies nor Pf-specific 
 
T cells were readily detected in the blood of the five vaccinated 
 
subjects who were not parasitemic after CHMI at 59 weeks. 
 
We hypothesized that the T cells resident in the liver might have a 
critical role in protection10,26.
Tissue-resident T cell responses in NHPs. Because liver-resident 
cellular immunity could not be directly assessed in the human sub-
jects, such responses were assessed in NHPs following immunization 
with PfSPZ (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 6). 
 
Immunogenicity studies with PfSPZ Vaccine in NHPs previously 
provided immune data that guided successful translation to human 
studies10,11. We had previously shown that 1.35 × 105 PfSPZ adminis-
tered by the s.c. route did not induce detectable T cell responses in the 
blood or liver of NHPs10, so we administered tenfold more PfSPZ in 
each of five doses that were administered by the i.m. or i.d. route and 
compared the T cell responses to those resulting from five i.v. doses

of 1.35 × 105 PfSPZ and four i.v. doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ (Fig. 6c). 
PfSPZ-specific CD4 T cell responses in PBMCs were modestly higher 
in NHPs vaccinated by the peripheral (i.m. or i.d.) routes than by 
the systemic (i.v.) route (P = 0.046), and there were no differences in 
PfRBC-specific CD8 T cell responses in PBMCs (Fig. 6d). In contrast, 
i.v. administration induced twofold higher frequencies of PfRBC- 
specific CD8 T cells in the liver, as compared to those induced by 
the 6- to 10-fold higher total doses of PfSPZ that were administered 
 
by the i.m. or i.d. route (Fig. 6e). Notably, the frequency of PfRBC- 
specific CD8 T cell responses in the liver were ~100-fold higher than in 
PBMCs. Moreover, whereas multiple populations of IFN-γ-producing 
 
lymphocytes—including NK cells, γδ T cells, and CD4 T cells—were 
identified in the livers of NHPs, the majority (~60%) were CD8 
 
T cells (Fig. 6f and Supplementary Fig. 11). The composition 
 
and differentiation state (i.e., memory phenotype) of lymphocytes 
in NHP livers largely reflect that of unvaccinated human liver 
samples, underscoring the biological relevance of the NHP model 
(Supplementary Fig. 11).
DISCUSSION
This was the first clinical trial of a malaria vaccine in which the first 
CHMI in one of the vaccine groups was done more than 4 weeks after 
the final immunization, thus representing a shift beyond a search 
for short-term protection toward trials that focus on dose and regi-
men optimization for durable sterilizing protection. At 59 weeks after 
four doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ each, the cumulative VE against CHMI 
was estimated to be 55%—the most durable efficacy against CHMI 
reported to date with an injectable malaria vaccine. In the vaccination 
 
regimens tested here, the efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine depended on 
both the dose per vaccination and the number of vaccinations. The 
estimated VE against CHMI done 3 weeks after immunization with 
three doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ was 24%, as compared to 73% with four 
doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ. Similarly, four or five doses of 1.35 × 105  
PfSPZ conferred an estimated 25% efficacy against CHMI at 21 weeks, 
as compared to 55% with four doses of 2.7 × 105 PfSPZ. On the basis of 
 
these data, we hypothesize that additional increases in the dosage of 
PfSPZ Vaccine will further increase the magnitude and durability 
of protective efficacy. Ongoing studies using 4.5 × 105 to 2.7 × 106 
PfSPZ per dose are assessing this for homologous CHMI, heterolo-
gous CHMI, and natural exposure in all age groups.
The route of administration influenced VE, further underscoring 
the importance of PfSPZ administration by the i.v. route in achieving 
protection with this vaccine. Completed studies in Mali, Tanzania, 
and Equatorial Guinea have provided the first data for the feasibility of 
direct venous inoculation (DVI) of PfSPZ Vaccine to adults in Africa 
(M. Sissoko (International Center for Excellence in Research, Mali), 
S. Healy (NIH), S. Shekalaghe & A. Olotu (both from Ifakara Health 
Institute, Tanzania), personal communication), and field studies in 
Africa have begun to determine the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of 
DVI administration in young children and infants.
An unexpected immunological finding was that the pre-vaccination 
 
frequency of circulating Vδ2+ T cells correlated with outcome 
of CHMI. Vδ2+ T cells recognize intracellular lipid metabolites 
(such as hydroxyl-methyl-butenyl-pyrophosphate (HMBPP)) from 
Plasmodium27,28. It is possible that these cells have a role in the initial 
priming of adaptive immune responses through rapid Pf recognition,

IFN-γ production (Supplementary Fig. 7m), 
 
and/or by serving as antigen-presenting 
cells29 at the time of immunization, leading 
to enhanced CD8 T cell priming30. γδ T cells 
have been shown to provide help to den-
dritic cells to facilitate protective responses 
to blood-stage malaria31, and IFN-γ-secreting 
γδ T cells are a correlate of protection against 
blood-stage malaria32. It is possible Vδ2+ T 
cells also mediate direct effector functions 
in the liver. A high frequency of circulating 
γδ T cells express CXCR6, a chemokine receptor that facilitates sur-
veillance of the liver sinusoids22, and produce IFN-γ and perforin 
(Supplementary Fig. 7i–m), two potent effector molecules shown 
to mediate killing of intracellular Pf. γδ T cells have been shown to 
contribute to protection against pre-erythrocytic malaria in mouse 
models21, and these T cells expand in humans following whole-SPZ 
immunization33. The correlation between γδ T cell frequency and 
CHMI outcome described herein suggests that PfSPZ Vaccine induces 
protective immunity not only through induction of conventional CD8 
and CD4 T cell responses but also through induction of γδ T cells. 
Such broad-based T cell responses that are induced by live-attenuated 
vaccines may not occur after immunization with the most commonly 
used protein- or virus-based subunit vaccines, highlighting one of 
many important differences between these approaches.
We previously showed a dose-dependent increase in Pf-specific 
antibodies and multifunctional cytokine-producing CD4 T cells with 
doses between 7.5 × 103 and 1.35 × 105 PfSPZ that were adminis-
tered by i.v. injection, but we could not assess correlates of protec-
tion because of the high-level of protection at the 3-week CHMI11. 
The clear dose response in this prior study11 probably reflects the 
wider range (18-fold) of doses given. In the present study, there was a 
smaller range of doses that were given by the i.v. route, which probably 
 
accounts for the narrower range of antibody and T cell responses. 
 
The correlates of protection described here are hypothesis-generating 
 
and require validation in large prospective studies. Moreover, cor-
relates of protection may differ depending on the dose per vaccina-
tion, the number of vaccinations, the time of sampling, and history 
of malaria exposure.
The data presented here are consistent with the following role for 
antibodies: at the time of early CHMIs (3 weeks), antibody responses 
were highest, and subjects may have reduced the numbers of PfSPZ 
that successfully invaded hepatocytes (Fig. 4c,d)14–16, allowing 
 
for rapid elimination of the remaining parasites in the liver by 
 
cellular responses34,35, thereby resulting in low Ki-67 expression by 
PfSPZ-specific CD4 T cells in the protected subjects. At the time of 
the later CHMIs (21–25 weeks and 59 weeks), antibody levels were 
considerably lower, resulting in more parasites reaching the liver after 
CHMI, thus leading to greater activation (based on Ki-67 expression) 
 
of PfSPZ-specific CD4 T cells during the clearance of liver-stage 
 
parasites (Fig. 5d,g,h).
Circulating Pf-specific T cell responses were low in blood at 
 
59 weeks in all of the subjects who were not parasitemic after CHMI

(Fig. 6a,b). Thus, if T cells are contributing to protection, then it 
may be due to an unmeasured aspect of the response in blood or to 
differential responses in the liver. Indeed, tissue-resident Pf-specific 
CD8 T cell responses in the liver of PfSPZ-vaccinated NHPs were 
highest after i.v. administration despite using 6- to 10-fold higher 
doses with the i.m. or i.d. route. Infectivity studies in mice show that 
>90% of SPZs that are administered by the i.m. or i.d. route fail to 
reach the liver12, and the parasite antigens are limited to muscle- or 
skin-draining lymph nodes36. Intravenous administration, in contrast, 
results in the efficient delivery of attenuated PfSPZ to the liver, where 
they presumably mediate priming of T cells that are programmed to 
remain as non-recirculating, liver-resident cells26. For PfSPZ Vaccine, 
efficacy is critically dependent on the route of vaccination. The data 
from the NHP studies indicate this is likely because i.v. administra-
tion induces robust tissue-resident responses in the liver, whereas 
peripheral (i.m. or i.d.) administration results in T cell responses in 
blood but more limited responses in the liver. Thus, for vaccines seek-
ing to induce protective T cells, vaccine development efforts may 
be misled by focusing solely on maximizing T cell responses in the 
blood without considering how the vaccination strategy affects T 
cell responses at the infection site. In summary, the immune data 
presented here support the conclusion that whereas antibodies may 
have some contribution to protection early after final immunization, 
tissue-resident CD8 T cells are probably necessary for durable sterile 
protection10,17–20,26,37,38.

ONLINE METHODS
VRC 312 study. VRC 312 (https://clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01441167) was a 
phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation trial with CHMI to assess the safety, 
immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine9,10 that was admin-
istered by intravenous (i.v.) injection. The VRC 312 clinical trial protocol, 
funding, study oversight, and data reporting have been previously described11. 
Subjects from the VRC 312 study were re-enrolled for repeat CHMI. PCR and 
thick blood smear (TBS) for detection of parasitemia were assessed in parallel. 
 
The criteria for initiation of treatment for malaria were: (i) a positive TBS, 
 
(ii) two consecutive positive PCRs, or (iii) one positive PCR with symptoms 
or signs consistent with malaria. Upon diagnosis of parasitemia, a 3-d course 
of atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone) was used for treatment.
VRC 314 study. VRC 314 (https://clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02015091) was a multi-
institution, phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation trial with CHMI, designed to 
assess the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine that 
was administered by i.v. or intramuscular (i.m.) injection. Complete inclusion 
and exclusion criteria are available at https://clinicaltrials.gov. Briefly, malaria-
naive, healthy US adults, 18–45 years of age, were screened for good health, 
including laboratory testing for hepatitis B and C, HIV
, and for pregnancy testing 
for women of child-bearing potential. Baseline complete blood counts, creatinine, 
and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were screened, and only volunteers with 
normal values were enrolled. Volunteers with significant cardiovascular risk were 
excluded (i.e., 5-year risk of >10%)39. Exclusion criteria included known history of 
malaria infection or vaccination, the presence of hemoglobin S by electrophoresis, 
and splenectomy. The Vaccine Research Center (VRC) Clinical Trials Core at the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) developed the protocol. 
The University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), Center for Vaccine Development 
(CVD) assisted with protocol development and study design. VRC and UMB 
CVD performed clinical duties. Sanaria produced, characterized, and prepared 
the syringes of PfSPZ Vaccine. The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research raised 
and infected mosquitoes, and assisted with the conduct of the CHMIs.
Study oversight and safety surveillance. Study Oversight and Safety Surveillance 
was approved by the Intramural Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). US Department of Health 
and Human Services guidelines for conducting clinical research were followed. 
Each step was reviewed and approved by a Safety Monitoring Committee 
and submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The protocol 
was reviewed by the FDA and conducted under IND 14826. Oral and written 
informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
Local injection-site and systemic reactogenicity parameters were recorded 
through 7 d after vaccination as solicited adverse events (AEs). Unsolicited 
AEs were recorded until day 28 post-CHMI. Serious AEs and new chronic 
medical conditions were recorded through 24 weeks following the last vaccina-
tion. AEs were graded using a Toxicity Grading Scale for Adults, adapted from 
FDA Guidance for Industry 2007 (ref. 40). Malaria infection was recorded as a 
separate study end point. Therefore, associated signs and symptoms were not 
included in unsolicited AE listings.
Vaccine and vaccination. PfSPZ Vaccine, which is composed of aseptic, purified, 
cryopreserved, metabolically active, radiation-attenuated P. falciparum sporo-
zoites, was manufactured as described9 using Pf NF54 parasites and met all 
quality control release- and stability-assay specifications. Cryovials containing 
PfSPZ Vaccine were thawed and formulated using phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS) and human serum albumin (HSA) as diluent. Vaccines were administered 
by rapid intravenous injection of 1-ml volume into an antecubital vein or by 
intramuscular injection in two divided doses of 0.25 ml in the deltoid muscle.
CHMI. CHMI was achieved by the bites of five PfSPZ-infected Anopheles 
stephensi mosquitoes, which met standard infectivity criteria41–43. All challenges 
were performed with the 3D7 clone. Subjects were monitored from days 7–28 
after CHMI until diagnosis and cure of parasitemia was documented. Blood 
draws for PCR were performed and analyzed daily as previously described11. 
Treatment with atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone) was initiated when two 
PCR results were positive for Pf parasitemia. For the week 3 CHMI for groups 1–3, 
 
based on the large number of vaccinated subjects and controls, half of the sub-
jects in each vaccine group were equally randomized and four unvaccinated 
controls underwent CHMI on two consecutive days (total of eight controls).
Efficacy analysis. For the primary efficacy analysis, the results of the first CHMI 
for each vaccine group were compared to controls who underwent CHMI con-
currently. To account for multiple comparisons, P < 0.01 was taken as evidence 
of an effect and P values between 0.01–0.05 were taken as suggestive of an effect. 
This threshold for significance of the primary analysis was specified in the pro-
tocol to partially address the potential for type-1-error-rate inflation. A strict 
Bonferroni adjustment would have been overly conservative, as the study design 
has several features, including the sequential and dependent nature of the groups 
and the use of new controls for each CHMI that resembles a sequence of small 
trials rather than a traditional parallel multi-arm trial. A fixed threshold that 
did not depend on the final number of groups was preferable in this case where 
results of some CHMIs were available before the next arm had been finalized. 
Secondary efficacy analyses compared the results from the different groups, as 
well as described the results of repeated challenges among those subjects who 
remained parasite free in each group. No formal multiple-comparison adjust-
ment was used for secondary end points.
For determining vaccine efficacy (VE), first VE was the VE (VE = 1 – relative 
risk) for the first CHMI. In instances in which a group underwent two CHMIs, 
vaccine recipients who developed parasitemia during the first CHMI did not 
undergo repeat CHMI. This was based on data in Supplementary Figure 1 
showing that vaccinated subjects who were parasitemic following CHMI and 
who were treated remained parasitemic following a second CHMI. Subgroup VE 
was VE among the subgroup of subjects who were not parasitemic at the prior 
CHMI. Cumulative VE is first VE multiplied by subgroup VE.
PfCSP ELISA. For ELISA measurement of IgG against PfCSP, a recombinant 
Pf circumsporozoite protein (rPfCSPv2) was used. The rPfCSP (3D7 clone) is 
a 48-kDa protein, which begins at amino acid residue 50 of the native protein 
sequence. The first six amino acids of rPfCSP are S-L-G-E-N-D. The central 
repeat region of this rPfCSP is composed of 22 N-A-N-P and 4 N-V-D-P tandem 
repeat sequences. 96-well plates (Nunc MaxiSorp Immuno Plate) were coated 
overnight at 4 °C with 2.0 µg rPfCSP/ml in 50 µl per well in coating buffer (KPL). 
Plates were then washed three times with 1× imidazole-based wash solution 
containing 2 mM imidazole, 160 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20, 0.5 mM EDTA 
and were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) blocking buffer (KPL) 
containing 1% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times, 
and serially diluted samples (in triplicates) were added and incubated at 37 °C 
for 1 h. After washing three times, peroxidase-labeled goat anti–human IgG 
(KPL) was added at a dilution of 0.1 µg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After 
washing three times, ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic 
acid)-diammonium salt) peroxidase substrate was added for plate development, 
and the plates were incubated for 75 min at 22 °C. The plates were read with 
a Spectramax Plus384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 405 nm. The 
data were collected using Softmax Pro GXP v5. Data were fit to a 4-parameter 
sigmoidal curve, and the reciprocal serum dilution at which the optical density 
was 1.0 (OD1.0) was calculated. To serve as assay controls, a negative control 
(pooled serum from non-immune individuals from a malaria-free area) and a 
positive control (serum from an individual with anti-PfCSP antibodies) were 
always included. The results are reported as net OD1.0, which was the OD1.0 of 
the post-immunization serum minus the OD1.0 of the pre-immunization serum. 
Samples were considered positive if the difference between the post-immuniza-
tion OD1.0 and the pre-immunization OD1.0 (net OD1.0) was >50 and the ratio 
of post-immunization OD1.0 to pre-immunization OD1.0 (ratio) was >2.5.

PfSPZ aIFA. Purified PfSPZ (NF54 strain) from aseptic A. stephensi mosquitoes, 
which was produced by Sanaria, were resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4). 0.5 × 104 
PfSPZ in 40 µl were added to each well of Greiner CELLSTAR clear-bottom black 
96-well plates (Sigma-Aldrich). After addition of the suspension, plates were 
left at room temperature for 12−18 h for air-drying. 50 µl of sera diluted in PBS 
with 2% BSA were added to each well containing air-dried PfSPZ. Sera samples

were added at twofold dilutions. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Plates 
were washed in PBS three times. Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated goat anti–human 
IgG (Molecular Probes) was diluted to 1:250 in PBS with 2% BSA, and 40 µl 
was added to each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates 
were washed three times with PBS. 100 µl PBS was added to each well. Samples 
were assessed by scanning the entire surface of each well using an Acumen 
eX3 laser-scanning imaging cytometer. The positive control was pooled human 
serum taken 2 weeks after the last immunization from 12 protected volunteers 
immunized four or five times with PfSPZ Vaccine in the VRC 312 clinical trial11. 
The data was plotted to fit a four-parameter sigmoidal curve. Sera from malaria-
naive volunteers in the USA and Europe, including pre-immune sera, always 
register an AFU (arbitrary fluorescence units) value less than 2.0 × 105, even at 
the highest concentration used in this assay (1:50 dilution). For sera that do bind 
to PfSPZ, 2.0 × 105 AFU falls in the exponential portion of the sigmoidal curves. 
Therefore 2.0 × 105 was chosen as the threshold in the aIFA assay, and the level 
of anti-PfSPZ antibodies for each volunteer is reported as the reciprocal serum 
dilution at which fluorescence intensity was equal to 2.0 × 105 AFU.
Supplementary Table 7 lists all PfSPZ antibody levels 2 weeks after final 
vaccination.
T cell assays. Assessment of cellular immune responses using multi-parameter 
flow cytometry was done from PBMCs on cryopreserved samples at the comple-
tion of the study. After thawing, PBMCs were rested for 8 h in complete RPMI 
(RPMI-1640 medium containing 2 mM l-glutamine (GE Life Sciences), 10% 
vol./vol. heat-inactivated FCS (Atlanta Biologicals), 100 U/ml penicillin (Life 
Technologies), 100 µg streptomycin (Life Technologies), 25 mM HEPES buffer 
(Life Technologies), 0.1% vol./vol. 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma)) containing 
 
25 U/ml Benzonase (EMD Biosciences), and plated in 200 µl of medium at 
1.5 × 106 cells per well in a 96-well V-bottom plate and stimulated for 17 h 
with: (i) PfSPZ Vaccine diluent (1% human serum albumin; CSL Behring); 
(ii) 1.5 × 105 viable, irradiated, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ from 
a single production lot; (iii) 2 × 105 lysed, infected RBCs consisting of >90% 
parasitemic late-stage schizonts (PfRBC) from a single production lot; or 
 
(iv) a single lot of donor-matched uninfected erythrocytes (uRBCs). PfSPZ 
 
and PfRBC were titrated for optimal sensitivity and specificity of detection of 
 
Pf-specific responses. For the last 5 h of the stimulation, 10 µg/ml brefeldin A 
 
(BD Biosciences) was added to the culture. A positive control sample from a 
subject vaccinated with five doses of 1.35 × 105 PfSPZ by i.v. injection and a 
negative malaria-naive control were included for each day the subjects were 
analyzed to determine the reproducibility of antigen stimulation.
After stimulation, cells were stained as previously described44. The stain-
ing panels are shown in Supplementary Table 6; the gating tree is shown in 
Supplementary Figures 4 and 5, and the antibody clones and manufacturers 
are shown in Supplementary Table 6. Briefly, cells were surface-stained for the 
chemokine receptor CCR7 at 37 °C for 20 min. Dead cells were identified by 
Aqua Live/Dead dye (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. This 
was followed by a 15-min surface-staining at room temperature for the markers 
CD4, CD8, CD14, CD20, CD38, CD45RA, CD56, TCR Vα-7.2, CD161, TCR-γδ, 
TCR-Vδ1, TCR-Vδ2, TCR-Vγ9, or CXCR6. Cells were washed, fixed, and per-
meabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) and were stained intra-
cellularly for CD3, IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, perforin, or Ki-67. Cells were washed, 
fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde, and signals were acquired on a modified LSR 
II (BD Biosciences). All antigen-specific cytokine frequencies are reported after 
background subtraction of identical gates from the same sample incubated with 
the control antigen stimulation (HSA or uRBC).
Human liver samples. Human liver samples were obtained under a clinical proto-
col unrelated to the PfSPZ vaccination protocol. The Regional Ethical Review Board 
in Stockholm, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, approved the study. Oral 
and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Livers were obtained 
during partial hepatectomy from living donors undergoing therapeutic tumor 
 
excision where only tumor-free unaffected tissue was used for isolation of immune 
cells. Immune cells were isolated using a previously described protocol45.
Functional assessment of vaccine-induced IgG. Total IgG serum antibodies 
were purified from serum or plasma by affinity chromatography using Pierce 
Protein G Plus Agarose (Thermo Scientific) according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Column-eluted IgG was concentrated and buffer-exchanged into phos-
phate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) using Amicon Ultra 30,000 MWCO centrifugal 
filters (EMD Millipore). Protein concentration of the purified IgG was calculated 
by the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific).
Human hepatocyte donor-matched FRG-huHep mice (male and female, aged 
5–9 months) were purchased from Yecuris, Inc. All animals were cared for in 
accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals46. 
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Center for Infectious 
Disease Research, Seattle, WA approved all animal procedures. Animals were 
randomly allocated to experimental and control groups.
Mice were intravenously injected with 8 mg/mouse of total IgG purified from 
vaccinated subjects or 150 µg of anti-PfCSP mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG3; 
clone 3C1; Rockefeller University) 16 h before challenge. For the mosquito bite 
challenge, Anopheles mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum expressing GFP–
luciferase were generated as previously described47. Mosquito infection was 
quantified at day 10 after blood meal and were used only if infection was >50% 
prevalence with an average of >10 oocysts/midgut. All qualifying mosquitoes 
were then pooled and distributed into cages with ~50 mosquitoes/mouse (up 
to 250 mosquitoes). Mice, in groups of up to five, were then anesthetized with 
isoflurane and placed on a mesh screen covering the container of mosquitoes 
while under isoflurane anesthesia. Mosquitoes were then allowed to feed for 10 
min, with lifting of mice once every minute to encourage probing and injection 
of sporozoites rather than blood feeding. After 10 min, the mice were returned 
to normal activity.
At day 6 post-infection (peak of liver burden), mice were imaged for liver-stage 
burden using bioluminescence and IVIS imaging as previously described24,48. 
Briefly, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 100 µl of RediJect d-Luciferin 
(PerkinElmer) and, after 5 min, were imaged with a 5-min exposure. Liver-
stage burden was assessed by placing a region of interest (ROI) around the liver 
of each mouse and measuring total flux in photons/s. An identical ROI was 
placed over the thorax, which was used to subtract background signal. Liver-
stage burden of all mice was normalized to the mean of the negative control 
group, which received pre-immune IgG. Sample size was based on prior passive 
transfer experiments and calculated using Prism (GraphPad) and JMP Design 
of Experiment functionality (SAS). Pearson correlation coefficient was used 
to determine the relationship between Pf liver-stage burden and PfCSP level. 
Investigators were blinded to treatment group during passive transfer of IgG, 
 
Pf infection, and measurement of luminescence.
NHP vaccinations. Thirty healthy male and female rhesus macaques of Indian 
origin (Macaca mulatta) with a mean (s.d.) age and weight of 6.1 (1.5) years 
and 8.7 (3.1) kg, respectively, were singly housed in animal biosafety level 2 
facilities and were monitored throughout the study for physical health, food 
consumption, body weight, and temperature. All animals were cared for in 
accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals46. 
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Vaccine Research 
Center, NIH approved all animal procedures.
Study groups were balanced with respect to age, weight, and gender (equal 
numbers of males and females in each group). Sample size was based on prior 
NHP immunogenicity studies and calculated using Prism (GraphPad) and JMP 
Design of Experiment functionality (SAS). PfSPZ Vaccine was formulated and 
administered as for human injection with the following exceptions. For i.v. 
groups, PfSPZ in 500 µl was administered by direct venous inoculation into the 
saphenous vein. For the i.m. group, PfSPZ was administered to the left and right 
deltoid, and each injection was 500 µl in volume. For the i.d. group, PfSPZ was 
administered in the skin over the left and right deltoid, and each injection was 
100 µl in volume. Immunizations and blood sampling occurred with the animal 
under anesthesia (10 mg per kg body weight ketamine HCl).
NHP T cell assays. Immune assays on PBMCs were batch-analyzed on cryo-
preserved samples at the completion of the study. PBMCs were isolated by den-
sity-gradient centrifugation from Acid–citrate–dextrose–anti-coagulated whole 
blood. Ten weeks after final immunization, animals were euthanized, and liver 
tissue was processed as previously described10. For immune analysis, samples 
were thawed, rested, stimulated, stained, and analyzed using identical reagents,

stimulation antigens, and protocol as the intracellular cytokine staining assay 
used for human PBMC samples (described above). The staining panel is shown 
in Supplementary Table 6; the gating tree is shown in Supplementary Figure 10; 
and the antibody clones and manufacturers are shown in Supplementary Table 6. 
 
Investigators were blinded to the treatment group during lymphocyte stimula-
tions and flow cytometry gating. All antigen-specific cytokine frequencies are 
reported after background subtraction of identical gates from the same sample 
incubated with the control antigen stimulation (HSA or uRBC).
Statistical analyses. Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo v9.8.5 (Tree 
Star). Statistical analyses were performed with Pestle v1.7 and SPICE v5.3 (M. 
Roederer)49, JMP 11 (SAS), Prism 6 (GraphPad), and R v3.2.2 with RStudio 
v0.99.483.
For vaccine immunogenicity, comparisons between groups were performed 
using Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn’s post-test correction for multiple comparisons. 
If no differences between vaccines groups were identified by Kruskal–Wallis, 
then differences from pre-vaccination were assessed by Wilcoxon matched-pairs 
signed rank test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, as speci-
fied in the figure legends.
Immune responses were assessed 2 weeks after the final immunization or pre-
vaccination (as specified in the figure legends) and were compared to outcome at 
either 3-week CHMI or 21- to 25-week CHMI. Assessment of immune responses 
that correlate with outcome at CHMI (parasitemia or no parasitemia) was made 
using a stratified Wilcoxon test controlling for vaccine regimen as a covariate.
