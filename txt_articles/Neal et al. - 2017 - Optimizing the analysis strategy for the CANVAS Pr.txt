Two large cardiovascular outcome trials of canagliflozin, comprising the CANVAS Program, will
complete in early 2017: the CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) and the
CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study–Renal (CANVAS-R). Accruing data for the
sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor class has identified questions and opportu-
nities that were not apparent when the trials were designed. Accordingly, a series of modifica-
tions have been made to the planned analyses. These updates will ensure that the data from
the CANVAS Program will maximize advances in scientific knowledge and patient care. The
specification of the analysis strategy prior to knowledge of the trial results, their design by the
independent scientific trial Steering Committee, the detailed a priori definition of the analysis
plans, and the external review provided by the US Food and Drug Administration all provide
maximally efficient and robust utilization of the data. The CANVAS Program should significantly
advance our understanding of the effects of canagliflozin, and the broader SGLT2 inhibitor
class, on a range of important efficacy and safety outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
Canagliflozin, an orally active inhibitor of sodium glucose co-
transporter 2 (SGLT2), was approved for marketing in the USA
on March 29, 2013 and is indicated as an adjunct to diet and
exercise to improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabe-
tes mellitus (T2DM).1 Three large outcome studies are ongoing
to evaluate canagliflozin (Figure 1). Two of these studies com-
plete in the next 12 months: the CANagliflozin cardioVascular
Assessment Study (CANVAS)2 and the CANagliflozin cardioVascu-
lar Assessment Study–Renal (CANVAS-R),3 which comprise the
CANVAS Program. The third, the Canagliflozin and Renal Events

(CREDENCE) trial, a trial independent of the CANVAS Program,
will determine the effects of canagliflozin on chronic kidney dis-
ease, but is not scheduled to complete until 2020.4
As new data have accrued for the SGLT2 inhibitor class, it has
become apparent that updating the objectives and analysis plans for
the CANVAS Program prior to study completion offers opportunities to
enhance the scientific, clinical and regulatory outcomes from the stud-
ies.5 Accordingly, the present paper describes the initial study plan and
analysis strategy, the rationale for modifications and the updates that
have been made for CANVAS, CANVAS-R and integrated analyses of
the CANVAS Program.

DRUG DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
FOR DIABETES
Historically, new therapies for diabetes were marketed on the basis of
well-tolerated improvements in blood glucose control. The supporting
phase III programmes typically comprised a few thousand patient-
years of follow-up, with post-marketing surveillance implemented to
protect against medium- to long-term risks. This model has been
deemed inadequate after the high-profile withdrawal from the market
of several therapies, years after marketing was first authorized,
because of likely serious adverse effects on cardiovascular outcomes.6
In December 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
issued new guidance describing an enhanced strategy for ensuring the
cardiovascular safety of drugs marketed for the management of dia-
betes by specifying explicit safety requirements for initial marketing
authorization, as well as more robust criteria for ensuring medium-
term safety.7 Specifically, the FDA has required evidence that the
upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the hazard ratio
(HR) of the composite cardiovascular outcome of vascular death, non-
fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke plus hospitalization for
unstable angina (major adverse cardiovascular events plus [MACE
plus]) is <1.8 at the time marketing authorization is sought. Post-
marketing requirements made by the FDA have then further required
that clearer evidence of safety is provided within a few years, such
that the upper bound of the 95% CI for the HR of the composite car-
diovascular outcome of vascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction
and non-fatal stroke (MACE) is <1.3.
Accordingly, the initial marketing authorization for canagliflozin
was supported by an analysis of cardiovascular events accrued in the
ongoing CANVAS trial and 8 other completed studies that consti-
tuted the phase II and phase III programme at that time.8 The data-
base within which cardiovascular safety was evaluated comprised
9632 participants. This analysis demonstrated initial cardiovascular
safety for the compound in line with FDA guidance by excluding an
upper bound of the 95% CI of the HR for MACE plus of 1.8. At the
time of approval, the FDA also set a post-marketing requirement that
the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the MACE HR be shown
to be <1.3 by September 2017, based on a larger patient exposure.7
To meet this requirement and after discussions with the FDA, a study
with directly comparable population, procedures and assessments,
the CANVAS-R study,3 was commenced in conjunction with the
ongoing CANVAS trial, such that an adequately powered analysis of
the data from the integrated CANVAS Program could be completed
within the specified timeframe.

CANVAS PROGRAM
The CANVAS Program comprises 2 trials, CANVAS and CANVAS-R,
and includes a prespecified integrated analysis of the 2. The inte-
grated analysis will enable the sponsor to meet the FDA post-
marketing requirement to determine the cardiovascular safety of
canagliflozin, as well as provide an opportunity to evaluate the poten-
tial for cardiovascular protection.

 cardiovascular disease in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM
and increased cardiovascular risk. As previously described,2 the study
was initially planned with 2 stages of study enrolment. The goal of
the first stage would be to substantiate the potential for cardiovascu-
lar protection by defining effects on key biomarkers and provide the
initial cardiovascular safety data required for marketing approval.9,10
The second stage would then expand recruitment with the aim of
demonstrating protection against serious cardiovascular events.
Fundamental to the original design of CANVAS and the integrity
of the second stage objective of demonstrating cardiovascular
protection was the prevention of the release of interim data defining
the effects on cardiovascular outcomes. Unblinding of the detailed
outcome effect estimate at any point before completion of the study
would represent a breach of the trial design principles. The intended
strategy had been developed through discussions with the FDA and
other regulatory agencies such that the review of the data for mar-
keting authorization would require only limited disclosure of the
effects on cardiovascular outcomes (ie, pass/fail in regard to exclu-
sion of the 1.8 hazard criterion) and trial integrity would be
preserved.
First-stage recruitment was achieved as planned with 4330 indi-
viduals randomized to placebo, canagliflozin 100 mg or canagliflozin
300 mg. During preparation of the programme-wide data for the ini-
tial marketing submission, an adverse effect on LDL cholesterol was
observed.1 In light of this finding, a decision was made by the spon-
sor to unblind CANVAS group-level cardiovascular outcome data in
January 2012 to provide the Health Authorities with the maximum
possible insight into the compound during the review of the initial
marketing application. Care was taken to ensure that subject-level
unblinded data were not available to the Steering Committee, End-
point Adjudication Committee, Sponsor personnel involved with
ongoing conduct of the trial or endpoint processing, the site investi-
gators or the participants. A subsequent disclosure was also made
using group-level data to November 2012 in response to a request
arising during review of the marketing application in Europe. No fur-
ther unblinding of cardiovascular outcome data has occurred since,
and, apart from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, no
members of the Steering Committee, Sponsor or study team have
seen or had access to any further unblinded data. The second stage
of recruitment of the planned additional 14 000 patients did not go
ahead, however, because of the unblinding of the interim cardiovas-
cular outcome results. Instead, a second separate study (CANVAS-R)
was initiated.
Cardiovascular events and other outcome data continue to
accrue amongst the original CANVAS cohort who remain on rando-
mized treatment and now have a median follow-up of ~5.7 years.
The FDA agreed that the vascular outcome data from CANVAS could,
in conjunction with additional data from another “CANVAS-like”
study, be used to address the second cardiovascular safety objective,
excluding an upper limit of the 95% CI for cardiovascular risk of 1.3,
during the immediate period post-marketing; however, the interim
unblinding of the CANVAS data carried out in 2012 meant that it
was unlikely that any regulatory objective beyond excluding the
upper limit of the HR of 1.3 could be achieved with the CANVAS
data as they stood. Likewise, the decision not to expand CANVAS
recruitment for the planned second stage meant that the capacity for
CANVAS alone to address the primary objective of cardiovascular
protection was severely affected because the failure to recruit the
additional 14 000 individuals greatly reduced statistical power.
3.2
| CANVAS-R
The CANVAS-R study3 is a second large prospective, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with T2DM
with a history or a high risk of cardiovascular events. CANVAS-R was
initiated after marketing authorization in the USA and in response to
the FDA regulatory requirement for a “CANVAS-like” study, the data
from which could be combined with data from the ongoing CANVAS
trial to address the specified post-marketing safety requirements.
Participants in CANVAS-R have nearly identical inclusion criteria to
those of CANVAS and have been assigned to once-daily placebo or
canagliflozin 100 mg (with optional uptitration to 300 mg) for a
planned average of 2 years of follow-up. The dosing strategy was
selected to reflect the labelling instructions in many countries in

 which canagliflozin is approved. The separate primary objective of
CANVAS-R is attenuation of kidney disease progression, as evi-
denced by fewer transitions from normo- to micro- or macro-, or
micro- to macroalbuminuria. The secondary objectives defined in the
original protocol were to determine corresponding effects on the
regression of albuminuria, on estimated glomerular filtration rate and
on albumin:creatinine ratio. To enable the study to meet the post-
marketing evaluation of cardiovascular safety in the integrated analy-
sis of data across the CANVAS Program, the procedures for recording
and managing serious adverse events and endpoint adjudication
across the 2 trials are identical (Table 1), as are the participant charac-
teristics (Table 2). This includes the use of a common independent
and blinded Endpoint Adjudication Committee that operates to the
same Charter that is used for CANVAS. CANVAS-R completed ran-
domization of 5812 individuals between January 2014 and May
2015 and median follow-up is currently 1.7 years.
The characteristics of patients enrolled in the CANVAS Pro-
gram are summarized in Table 2. A total of 10 142 participants
were randomized to the studies, including 65% with a history of
cardiovascular disease and 35% with at least 2 risk factors for car-
diovascular disease. The characteristics of the patients enrolled in
CANVAS and CANVAS-R were similar with respect to duration of
T2DM, microvascular disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease.

| Accumulating evidence about the effects of
SGLT2 inhibition
Since the design of CANVAS and CANVAS-R, substantial new data
have been reported about the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on clinical
outcomes. This includes evidence about possible new risks, such as
diabetic ketoacidosis,11 bone fracture12,13 and amputation,14,15 as
well as a possible protective effect for some cardiovascular and renal
outcomes. In particular, the 2015 report of the EMPA-REG OUT-
COME trial implied large benefits for cardiovascular death, heart fail-
ure, total mortality and kidney outcomes.16,17 A recent meta-analysis
of the totality of the evidence describing the effects of SGLT2 inhibi-
tion indicates that the EMPA-REG OUTCOME findings are consistent
with the broader evidence base and that the EMPA-REG OUTCOME
results are likely to provide a good approximation of the effects of
other agents in this class5; however, many of the analyses were post
hoc, the numbers of events included in some were small and there is
an urgent need to determine their repeatability in adequately pow-
ered, prespecified analyses of large new datasets with adjudicated
data. The soon-to-be-completed CANVAS Program provides a unique
near-term opportunity to achieve this, but modification of the exist-
ing objectives will be required to enable the a priori specification of
the most important outstanding questions and the robust testing of
key hypotheses in the CANVAS Program.

PRINCIPLES UNDERPINNING THE
UPDATED ANALYSIS STRATEGY
The accumulating data about SGLT2 inhibitors provides much better
insight into the most likely effects of canagliflozin than was available
at the time the CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials were designed. In par-
ticular, there are now more data about the serious adverse events
most likely to be prevented or caused by canagliflozin and the likely
magnitudes of the effect sizes that can be anticipated. In light of
these data, there are opportunities to modify the initially planned
analysis strategies for CANVAS, CANVAS-R and the integrated
CANVAS Program to maximize the further scientific insights obtained
from the trials. In specifying the changes, a series of methodological,
clinical and regulatory issues have been considered.
4.1
| Maximizing statistical power
Maximizing statistical power to detect plausible effects of canagliflo-
zin can be achieved by increasing the quantity of data available
and/or selecting outcomes for which effects of the greatest size are
anticipated. The quantity of data available to address hypotheses can
be increased by combining the CANVAS and CANVAS-R datasets for
integrated analyses across the CANVAS Program and by evaluating
the effects of all doses of canagliflozin combined vs placebo (rather
than investigating the separate effects of each dose). These 2 strate-
gies have been planned from the outset for the evaluation of cardio-
vascular safety (ie, ruling out an upper bound of 1.3 on MACE), and
the strategy is now being used for the assessment of cardiovascular
efficacy. The combined recruitment of 10 142 participants to the
CANVAS and CANVAS-R trials is lower than was initially planned for
CANVAS (18 000 participants) and this reflects a Sponsor decision to
focus on demonstrating cardiovascular safety after second-stage
recruitment to CANVAS was discontinued. Subsequently, the greater
than anticipated effects on vascular outcome reported by the EMPA-
REG OUTCOME trial suggest that, even with this reduced sample

 size, the CANVAS Program will have reasonable power to test effi-
cacy for several outcomes. Specifically, the apparently large effects of
SGLT2 inhibition on vascular death, total mortality, heart failure and
kidney disease present opportunities to test hypotheses of protection
related to these outcomes that were not previously considered feasi-
ble with the quantity of data accrued within CANVAS, CANVAS-R or
even across the integrated data from the 2 trials.
4.2
| Minimization of the risk of chance findings
The minimization of the risk of chance findings is being achieved
through the use of a sequential testing process, which was also a fea-
ture of the original protocols for both CANVAS and CANVAS-R;
however, because the updated analysis plan will include testing of
both safety and efficacy in the individual and the integrated datasets,
a new single sequential testing plan has been defined. This plan cov-
ers all the main hypotheses from the integrated and individual study
datasets, and will control type I error at 5% across all.
4.3
| Outcomes for investigation
Primary, secondary and exploratory outcomes have been updated to
focus on complications of diabetes for which benefits appear likely to
be detectable. Accordingly, analyses of vascular death, total mortality,
heart failure and kidney disease have been prioritized. In parallel, ana-
lyses of outcomes addressing myocardial infarction for which effects
appear lesser or absent, and stroke for which SGLT2 inhibition may
cause harm,5 have been refined. In terms of multicomponent out-
comes, the regulatory assessment of cardiovascular safety is reasona-
bly based on MACE, a broad composite that encompasses the most
common serious vascular outcomes experienced by patients with dia-
betes; however, if there are effects of different magnitude or direc-
tion on specific cardiovascular outcomes, the use of a composite will
conceal important information about the effects of the agent. As
such, in addition to the prescribed safety analyses on composite car-
diovascular events, additional analyses investigating effects on cause-
specific outcomes are now proposed.
4.4
| Protection against the risks of bias or
confounding
Protection against the risks of bias or confounding has been central
to the designs of CANVAS, CANVAS-R and the planned integrated
analysis of the CANVAS Program, and is achieved through randomi-
zation, blinding and intention-to-treat analysis. Premature discontinu-
ation of treatment by some patients will result in underestimation of
the true effects of the drug on most outcomes, but the likely impact
can be quantified and the direction of the effect is known. Considera-
ble efforts are being made to maximize the completeness of follow-
up but sensitivity analyses using each of worst-case single imputa-
tion, multiple imputation and delta methods will be undertaken to
identify the range of possible effects of missing data for key
outcomes.
There is also a potential for bias that results from the interim
unblinding of the CANVAS data, because it is possible that the
implementation of the study differed after the data were revealed
(operational bias), or that the decision to continue with the study
itself was based on that knowledge (a statistical bias). In practice, the
likelihood of important bias is small because the trial was planned to
continue and did, substantive changes to the CANVAS protocol have
not been made, and the cardiovascular events accrued by November
2012 will be only a small proportion of all events recorded. Reflecting
the low level of risk of bias, the FDA will accept for review the inte-
grated CANVAS and CANVAS-R data to fulfil a post-marketing cardi-
ovascular safety requirement (ie, rule out an upper bound of 1.3) and
also consider the possibility of using the integrated CANVAS Program
data to address cardiovascular efficacy. There is, nonetheless, a theo-
retical risk of bias consequent on the inclusion of the unblinded
interim CANVAS data in a final analysis. As such, the efficacy hypoth-
eses addressing the effects of canagliflozin on vascular death and
total mortality in the combined CANVAS Program data from CAN-
VAS and CANVAS-R are proposed to be carried out on a modified
integrated dataset. Specifically, the data from CANVAS that contrib-
ute to the integrated dataset used for primary testing of the hypoth-
eses of protection against death will be left-truncated such that all
CANVAS study time and mortality events prior to November 20,
2012 will be excluded; the November 20, 2012 date reflects the last
time MACE data from the CANVAS study were unblinded at the
request of a health authority.
Left-truncation of the data will result in an unbiased estimate of
effect for the entire study if the proportional effect of the interven-
tion on the outcome of interest is constant over time, as appears to
be the case for fatal outcomes with SGLT2 inhibitors16; however, if
greater benefits accrue early in treatment rather than later, as may be
the case, for example, for the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart
failure, then left-truncation would result in a biased estimate of the
overall treatment effect.16 The constancy of treatment effects over
time, and the constancy of effects across the 2 studies, which have
different durations of follow-up, will be examined.

| Achieving regulatory outcomes
The primary goal of reviewing the analysis strategy for CANVAS,
CANVAS-R and the integrated CANVAS Program datasets has been to
maximize the opportunity to make new scientific discoveries from the
data; however, the ultimate goal is to improve the care of patients with
diabetes and, importantly, the uptake of new therapies by clinicians is
determined by their regulatory status. As such, throughout the review
process, an additional consideration in updating the analytical approach
has been to maximize concurrently the possibility of achieving appropri-
ate new indications to be reflected in labelling.

UPDATED HYPOTHESES AND
OUTCOMES FOR INVESTIGATION
The initial and updated plans for hypothesis testing in CANVAS,
CANVAS-R and the integrated CANVAS Program data are summar-
ized in Table 3. Table 4 shows the full set of primary, secondary and
exploratory outcomes that will be evaluated. The strategy for control

 of the type I error at 5% for multiple hypothesis testing is shown in
Figure 2. The primary hypothesis test will be of non-inferiority for
the HR for MACE at the margin of 1.3 for all canagliflozin vs placebo
using the full integrated dataset (null hypothesis, H0: the HR ≥1.3, vs
the alternative hypothesis, H1: the HR <1.3). Cardiovascular safety
will be demonstrated if, as compared with placebo, the upper bound
of the 95% CI of the HR is <1.3. If the null hypothesis H0 is rejected
and the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the HR is also <1.0, it
will be concluded that canagliflozin is superior to placebo. Testing of
the secondary mortality hypotheses will proceed sequentially, condi-
tional on the primary safety hypothesis being met, but will be based
on the truncated integrated dataset that excludes the CANVAS study
time and mortality events accrued prior to November 20, 2012. For
these mortality endpoints, the statistical hypothesis on the HR of
canagliflozin over placebo will be tested (null hypothesis, H0: the
HR ≥1.0, vs the alternative hypothesis, H1: the HR <1.0). Canagliflo-
zin will be deemed to be superior in reducing these mortality end-
points as compared with placebo if the upper bound of 95% CI of the
HR is <1.0. Testing will continue at the 5% significance level, with
assessment of subsequent endpoints proceeding in order, conditional
on achieving statistical significance with the prior test.
If the MACE and the mortality endpoints tested on the inte-
grated dataset succeed in rejecting the null hypotheses, all of the
alpha for testing (ie, 5%) will pass to the CANVAS-R dataset for test-
ing of the renal and cardiovascular efficacy hypotheses specified for
that study. No alpha is preserved for evaluating hypotheses in
CANVAS and only nominal P values will be reported for all other end-
points assessed in the CANVAS, CANVAS-R and integrated CANVAS
Program datasets. The truncated integrated dataset will only be used
for testing the hypotheses of protection against total mortality and
cardiovascular mortality, with the primary outcome and all explora-
tory outcomes planned for the integrated data to be investigated
using the full integrated CANVAS Program dataset.
The anticipated numbers of events, assumed minimum effect
sizes and projected statistical power for the hypothesis testing are
shown in Table 5. The analyses of mortality outcomes based on the
left-truncated dataset will be carefully examined for evidence of vary-
ing effects of the intervention over time. If present, then the focus of
reporting for these outcomes will be on the subsidiary analyses based
on the full dataset.

SAFETY ANALYSES
In the same way that analysis of the integrated data from CANVAS
and CANVAS-R will provide a more precise and reliable assessment
of the efficacy of the compound, so too will evaluations of the inte-
grated data provide a better assessment of non-cardiovascular safety.
The safety analyses will be based on an on-treatment analysis set as
the approach least likely to favour canagliflozin, unless otherwise

data from CANVAS and data from 8 other phase II and phase III trials of canagliflozin that were completed by January 2012.

 specified, and all instances of relevant adverse events collected
across the 2 studies, regardless of whether they were collected in
exactly the same way, will be included. That said, the evaluation of
clinical laboratory test results and vital signs will be made only at the
visits that are commonly scheduled in CANVAS and CANVAS-R. The
integrated safety analyses will be based on the observed data with
no imputation of missing values, and the combined doses of canagli-
flozin will be compared against placebo for the primary analyses.
Analyses will be of serious adverse events grouped into major
categories defined by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA),18 adverse events that resulted in study drug discontinua-
tion and adverse events of interest. This latter group includes osmotic
diuresis, volume depletion, hypoglycaemia, urinary tract infection,
female mycotic genital infection, severe hypersensitivity/cutaneous
reactions, pancreatitis, hepatic injury, acute kidney injury and renal-
related adverse events, male genital infection (balanitis, phimosis,

 the completion of these trials results in the maximum possible likeli-
hood of advances in scientific knowledge and patient care. They take
a deliberately conservative approach to minimize the likelihood of
spurious findings and to maximize the likelihood that any observed
effects are real. The specification of these changes prior to knowl-
edge of the trial results, their careful planning by the independent sci-
entific trial Steering Committee, the detailed a priori definition of the
statistical analysis plans and input provided by the FDA all allow the
efficient and robust utilization of the data. The new data from the
CANVAS Program should significantly advance our understanding of
the effects of canagliflozin, and the broader SGLT2 inhibitor class, on
a range of efficacy and safety outcomes of key importance to
patients with diabetes.
