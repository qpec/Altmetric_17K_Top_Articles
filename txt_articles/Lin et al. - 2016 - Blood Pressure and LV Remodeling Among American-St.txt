Abstract
Objective—To determine the relationships between American style football (ASF) participation, 
acquired left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and LV systolic function as assessed using 
contemporary echocardiographic parameters.
Background—Participation in ASF has been associated with the development of hypertension 
and LV hypertrophy. To what degree these processes impact LV function is unknown.
Methods—This is a prospective, longitudinal, cohort study evaluating NCAA Division I 
collegiate football athletes stratified by field position (linemen, n=30 vs. non-linemen, n=57) 
before and after a single competitive season with transthoracic echocardiography. LV systolic 
function was measured using complementary parameters of global longitudinal strain (GLS, 2D 
speckle-tracking) and ejection fraction (EF, 2D biplane).
Results—ASF participation was associated with field position-specific increases in systolic 
blood pressure (linemen Δ SBP = 10±8 mmHg vs. non-linemen Δ SBP = 3±7 mmHg, p<0.001) 
and an overall increase in incident LV hypertrophy (pre = 8% vs. post = 25%, p<0.05). Linemen 
who developed LV hypertrophy had concentric geometry (9/11, 82%) with decreased GLS (Δ = 
−1.1%, p<0.001) while non-linemen demonstrated eccentric LV hypertrophy (8/10, 80%) with 
increased GLS (Δ = +1.4%, p<0.001). In contrast, LV ejection fraction in the total cohort and 
when stratified by field position was not significantly affected by ASF participation. Among the 
total cohort, lineman field position, postseason weight, systolic blood pressure, average LV wall 
thickness, and relative wall thickness were all independent predictors of postseason GLS.
Conclusions—ASF participation at a lineman field position may lead to a form of sport-related 
myocardial remodeling that is pathologic rather than adaptive. Future study will be required to 
determine if targeted efforts to control blood pressure, minimize weight gain, and to include an

Introduction
Hypertension affects approximately 30% of adults in the United States and is associated 
with premature cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction, stroke, arrhythmias, 
and heart failure (1,2). Recently, it has been demonstrated that early life hypertension is a 
strong independent predictor of later life cardiovascular disease and premature mortality 
(3,4). Additionally, elevated blood pressure in adolescent athletes predicts sustained 
hypertension one year later (5). As such, the identification and management of hypertension 
in at-risk younger people may improve long-term cardiovascular health.
American style football (ASF) is a popular sport with more than 5 million annual 
participants in the United States (6,7). Prior cross-sectional studies suggest an association 
between ASF participation and hypertension (8–11). Recent longitudinal work from our 
group demonstrated that participation in a single season of ASF is associated with increased 
systolic blood pressure among linemen and that increases in blood pressure are associated 
with the development of concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (12). These findings 
are relevant in the context of prior data from the National Institute of Occupational Health 
and Safety (NIOHS) which demonstrated increased risk of cardiovascular mortality among 
former professional linemen compared to the general population but provided no insights 
regarding causal mechanisms (13).
Sustained exposure to elevated blood pressure results in end-organ damage including 
hypertensive heart disease. Structurally, hypertensive heart disease is characterized by 
concentric LV hypertrophy which is defined by an increase in LV mass and wall thickness 
without concomitant enlargement in LV cavity size (14). Functionally, patients with early-
stage hypertensive concentric LV hypertrophy typically demonstrate preserved LV ejection 
fraction (15–17), but often display subclinical systolic dysfunction as measured by global 
longitudinal strain (GLS), a well-validated echocardiographic parameter of myocardial 
systolic function with attendant prognostic implications (18,19).
We therefore undertook the present study with the following goals. First, we aimed to 
validate our prior observation that ASF participation is accompanied by an increase in blood 
pressure and LV hypertrophy. Second, we aimed to examine the functional correlates of 
ASF-induced LV hypertrophy in an attempt to delineate the functional implications of this 
form of “athlete’s heart”.

 Methods
Study Design
We utilized a prospective, longitudinal design to examine blood pressure, LV remodeling, 
and LV systolic function among competitive ASF participants at an NCAA Division 1 
University. We enrolled varsity-level ASF athletes as part of the Harvard Athlete Initiative, 
an ongoing research program designed to address issues relevant to athlete health and 
exercise physiology. Clinical and anthropometric data related to blood pressure including 
age (years), height (cm), weight (kg), ethnicity (black versus non-black), personal and 
family history of hypertension were obtained (20). Body surface area (BSA) was calculated 
with the Mosteller formula (21), and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as follows: 
[weight (kg)/height (m)2]. Resting blood pressure, heart rate, LV structural parameters, and 
indices of LV systolic function were assessed before and after a single season of ASF 
participation as detailed below. Each participant provided written consent prior to enrollment 
and all aspects of the study were approved by the Partners Human Research Committee.
Study Population
ASF athletes were eligible to participate if they were ≥ 18 years of age and recruited 
members of the Harvard University varsity football team. For this study, we enrolled first-
year university athletes to ensure data capture of their initial season of college-level 
participation. The study period began at the time of enrollment and lasted for the entire ASF 
season (~90 days). Field position for each participant was classified as either lineman or 
non-lineman. Linemen included players at tackle, guard, center, or defensive end positions 
while non-linemen included quarterbacks, running backs, wide receivers, tight ends, 
linebackers, cornerbacks, safeties, kickers, and punters (22). Each participant was subject to 
testing for performance-enhancing drugs as dictated by NCAA standards. Subjects were 
excluded from the final analysis if they undertook training breaks of ≥ 3 days for any reason 
or if their echocardiographic images were unsuitable for GLS analysis.
Blood Pressure Measurement
A cardiologist (J.L., A.B., R.W., M.W.) measured blood pressures at enrollment (preseason) 
and during postseason assessment with a manual sphygmomanometer and an appropriately 
sized arm cuff. Participants were supine for at least 10 minutes of quiet rest for this process. 
Reported values represent the average of triplicate measurements. Blood pressure was 
classified according to Joint National Commission-7 (JNC-7) guidelines into the following 
categories: normal (SBP<120 mmHg and SBP<80 mmHg), pre-hypertension (SBP=120 to 
139 mmHg or DBP=80–89 mmHg), and stage 1 or greater hypertension (SBP≥140 mmHg 
or DBP≥90 mmHg).23 Joint National Commission-8 (JNC-8) guidelines were not used as 
they do not define blood pressure thresholds for pre-hypertension. The JNC-8 report does 
recommend pharmacologic therapy at a blood pressure of 140/90 (24), which is consistent 
with the definition of hypertension used in this study.

 Transthoracic Echocardiography
Cardiac imaging was performed with a commercially available echocardiography system 
(Vivid-I, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) with a 1.9- to 3.8-mHz phased-array transducer. 
Images were obtained by a sonographer credentialed in cardiac ultrasound or a cardiologist 
trained in echocardiography. Participants were imaged at rest ≥ 12 hours after the most 
recent training session at Harvard University during the preseason and postseason. The 
postseason images were acquired within 5 days of the completion of the final game of the 
season. Two-dimensional imaging was performed from standard parasternal and apical 
transducer positions with frame rates confined to 60–100 Hz as determined on an individual 
basis for image optimization. All data were stored digitally and two cardiologists (J.L., A.B) 
blinded to study time point performed all off-line analyses (EchoPac, version 7.0, GE 
Healthcare).
Cardiac structural measurements were made in accordance with current guidelines (25). LV 
volumes and ejection fraction were measured and calculated with the modified Simpson 
biplane technique. LV mass was calculated using the area-length method, which was chosen 
because it accounts for LV morphology in both short- and long-axis dimensions, and LV 
hypertrophy was defined as LV mass index > 102 g/m2 (25). Average LV wall thickness was 
calculated as follows: [interventricular septal thickness (mm)+posterior wall thickness 
(mm)]/2. Relative wall thickness was calculated as: [interventricular septal thickness (mm)
+posterior wall thickness (mm)]/LV end-diastolic diameter (mm). Concentric LV 
hypertrophy was defined by relative wall thickness > 0.42 with LV mass index > 102 g/m2; 
eccentric LV hypertrophy was defined by relative wall thickness ≤ 0.42 and LV mass index > 
102 g/m2 (25).
GLS measurements were made using commercially available speckle-tracking analysis 
software (EchoPac, Version 7.0, GE Healthcare) as previously reported.26–28 In brief, the 
highest-quality digital 2D apical 4-chamber view was selected for analysis. The 
endocardium was traced and a full thickness myocardial region of interest was selected. The 
software then automatically partitioned the LV into 6 segments including apical (n=2), septal 
(n=2), and lateral (n=2) territories and selected suitable speckles for tracking. The reliability 
of tracking was confirmed by the software’s reliability parameter (V = valid tracking; X = 
unacceptable tracking). When the software signaled poor tracking efficiency, the observer 
readjusted the endocardial trace and/or region of interest width until an acceptable tracking 
score was obtained. By convention, GLS values are presented as negative numbers with 
lower (i.e. more negative) values representing greater systolic shortening. Measurements 
were obtained on 3 consecutive cardiac cycles and reported values represent a 3-cycle 
average. Participants in whom full 6-segment strain data over 3 consecutive cardiac cycles 
could not be obtained were excluded from final analyses.
Measurement Variability
The intraobserver and interobserver variability for LV mass and GLS were examined. 
Intraobserver variability was performed by a single investigator through blinded assessment 
of 10 randomly selected subjects on 2 separate occasions. Interobserver variability was 
assessed in a group of 10 randomly selected subjects by 2 investigators blinded to each

 other’s measurements and to study time point. Correlation coefficients for each 
measurement, derived from simple linear regression, were used to quantify variability with 
the following results: intraobserver LV mass (R2= 0.946), intraobserver GLS (R2= 0.968), 
interobserver LV mass (R2= 0.921), and interobserver GLS (R2= 0.972).
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables are presented as proportions and continuous variables as mean±SD. 
Paired data were compared using paired t-testing or McNemar’s exact test while unpaired 
data were compared using Student’s independent sample t-test or Fisher’s exact test as 
appropriate for data distribution. Correlation analyses were performed using the Spearman 
or Pearson’s technique as appropriate for data distribution. Univariate linear regression 
analyses were used to identify factors associated with postseason GLS. Parameters with a 
univariate p-value of <0.10 were included in a forward stepwise multivariate linear 
regression model designed to identify factors independently associated with postseason 
GLS. All analyses were performed with SPSS (Version 22, IBM Corp ©).
Results
Study Population
Among 190 eligible ASF participants enrolled from 2008–2014, 87 (all men, age=18.8±0.8 
years) were included in this analysis. Subject attrition (n=103) was due to intraseason 
injuries (25 of 103 athletes, 24%) and our strict a priori imaging quality exclusion criteria 
(78 of 103 athletes, 76%). Of note, there were no significant differences in field position 
(34% linemen and 66% non-linemen), blood pressure trends, or LV structural parameters 
between those excluded and those retained. The final cohort included 30 linemen (height 
191±5 cm; weight 111±12 kg) and 57 non-linemen (height 185±6 cm; weight 90±9). 
Linemen had significantly higher BMI than non-linemen (30.6±3.5 vs. 26.4±2.0 kg/m2, 
p<0.001). Twenty-four athletes (27%) were of black ethnicity and 22 athletes (25%) had a 
family history of hypertension. Weight (111±12 to 114 ±12 kg, p=0.002), BMI (30.6±3.5 to 
31.2±3.5 kg/m2, p=0.007), and BSA (2.42±0.13 to 2.44±0.13 m2, p=0.01) all increased 
significantly in the linemen group from baseline to postseason while no significant changes 
occurred among the non-linemen (Table 1).
Blood Pressure
ASF participation was associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure in the total 
cohort (119±10 to 124±12 mmHg, p<0.001) but no significant change in diastolic blood 
pressure. Although both linemen (pre: 122±8 vs. post: 132±10 mmHg, p<0.001; Table 1) 
and non-linemen (pre: 117±11 vs. post: 120±13 mmHg, p<0.001) had increases in systolic 
blood pressure, the magnitude of increase was significantly greater among linemen 
(linemen: Δ = 10±8 vs. non-linemen: Δ = 3±7 mmHg, p<0.001) (Figure 1A). At preseason, 
the prevalence of pre-hypertension was similar between linemen (17/30, 57%) and non-
linemen (29/57, 51%, p=0.31) and no athletes met criteria for overt hypertension. At 
postseason assessment, 90% of linemen met criteria for pre-hypertension (18/30, 60%) or 
Stage 1 hypertension (9/30, 30%) while only 49% (28/57) of non-linemen, a proportion 
similar to the preseason, had blood pressure exceeding upper limits of normal (Figure 1B).

 Left Ventricular Structure
LV mass index did not differ significantly at preseason as a function of field position 
(linemen: 97±15 vs. non-linemen: 94±12 g/m2, p=0.10; Table 2). Among the total cohort, 
ASF participation lead to a significant increase in LV mass index (pre: 95±13 vs. post: 
104±15 g/m2, p<0.001) but LV mass index increased more among linemen (Δ = linemen: 
13±15 vs. non-linemen: Δ = 7±10 g/m2, p=0.02). In the total cohort, the prevalence of LV 
hypertrophy increased from 8% (7/87) at preseason to 24% (21/87, p<0.001) at postseason. 
Among linemen with LV hypertrophy at postseason, 9/11 (82%) demonstrated concentric 
geometry while in contrast, 8/10 (80%) non-lineman with LV hypertrophy demonstrated 
eccentric geometry.
Left Ventricular Systolic Function
LV ejection fraction was similar among linemen (59 ± 6 %, range: 49–69%) and non-
linemen (59 ± 6 %, range: 46–79%) at preseason (p=0.93) and was not significantly different 
at postseason. GLS was also similar between field position groups at preseason (linemen = 
−21.2 ± 2.4% vs. non-linemen = −20.8 ± 2.7%, p=0.26). However, GLS was significantly 
changed at postseason in both position groups with changes occurring in opposite directions. 
Specifically, linemen demonstrated a significant decrement in GLS (Δ = 1.1%, p<0.001) 
while non-linemen experienced a significant increase (Δ = 1.4%, p<0.001; Figure 2). The 
observed GLS decrement among linemen correlated indirectly with changes in systolic 
blood pressure (R= −0.47, p=0.009) and LV mass index (R= −0.52, p=0.003) while no such 
relationships were observed among non-linemen (R = 0.01, p=0.49; R = 0.09, p=0.93 
respectively). Univariate and multivariate predictors of postseason GLS are shown in Table 
3. In a multivariate linear regression model, lineman position (β=0.402, p<0.001), 
postseason weight (β=0.375, p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (β=0.325, p<0.001), average 
LV wall thickness (β=0.234, p<0.001), and LV relative wall thickness (β=0.218, p=0.003) 
were independent predictors of postseason GLS.
Discussion
Key findings from this study are summarized as follows. First, our data confirm previously 
reported associations between ASF participation, increases in systolic blood pressure, and 
the development of concentric LV hypertrophy. These observations appear particularly 
relevant to ASF linemen. Second, we demonstrate that the development of concentric LV 
hypertrophy among linemen is characterized by concomitant reductions in LV longitudinal 
strain, a well-validated marker of subclinical LV dysfunction with attendant adverse 
prognosis. In aggregate, these findings advance our understanding of cardiac remodeling 
among athletes and challenge the pervasive notion that all sport-related cardiovascular 
changes are adaptive rather than pathologic.
A 1994 report from the NIOSH evaluated the medical status of 6848 retired NFL players 
(13). While the study documented a 46% decreased rate of death among former NFL players 
compared to a general population of age-matched men, it showed a 52% increase in 
cardiovascular mortality among linemen. Subsequent studies have confirmed a similar 
increase in heart disease mortality in active and former ASF linemen as well as a higher risk

 of metabolic syndrome and subclinical carotid atherosclerosis (11,29,30). While elevated 
body mass has been proposed as a key explanatory factor, this parameter unlikely explains 
the complete mechanistic story (10,31). Data from the current study introduce a more 
comprehensive mechanistic explanation in the form of acquired, early-life hypertension with 
resultant target organ damage in the form of concentric LV hypertrophy with subclinical LV 
systolic dysfunction.
Traditional assessment of LV systolic function relies on measurement of LV ejection 
fraction, a relatively crude volumetric technique that is exquisitely load dependent, highly 
reliant on image quality, and based on key geometric assumptions that may not be valid in 
the setting of significant cardiac remodeling (32). Speckle-tracking echocardiography 
minimizes these limitations and more accurately captures subtle yet clinically relevant 
changes in cardiac function. Global longitudinal strain (GLS), the systolic function 
parameter utilized in this study, has emerged as a highly reproducible metric with powerful 
prognostic implications in numerous clinical populations. Among patients with hypertensive 
heart disease and preserved ejection fraction, mean GLS is uniformly decreased and 
inversely correlated with systolic blood pressure, LV mass, and the presence of concentric 
remodeling or hypertrophy (33–35).
Prior studies of GLS among athletic cohorts, almost exclusively confined to athletes in 
endurance sports, have demonstrated preservation or increase in contractile function 
highlighting the generally adaptive nature of exercise-induced cardiac remodeling. In a study 
evaluating GLS in rowers, age-matched hypertensive subjects on no therapy, and 
normotensive sedentary controls, the hypertensive group had significantly lower GLS 
(17.5±2.8%) compared to rowers (−22.2±2.7%) and controls (21.1±2.0%) (36). In addition, 
prior work by our group documented increases in GLS after 90-days of endurance training 
among competitive rowers (26). The present study builds on this work in two principal ways. 
First, the finding of LV hypertrophy with GLS augmentation among non-lineman ASF 
athletes, a group exposed to a mixture of isometric and isotonic physiology (i.e. skills 
training and aerobic conditioning), suggests an adaptive form of remodeling similar to that 
seen in other athlete cohorts. Second, in stark comparison, LV hypertrophy with relative 
impairment of GLS among ASF lineman, a group exposed to predominantly isometric 
physiology (i.e. blocking and tackling drills), suggests maladaptive remodeling. To our 
knowledge, this study is the first to document a relative impairment of GLS among athletes 
and provides plausible physiologic and anatomic correlates in the forms of acquired 
hypertension and concentric LV hypertrophy, respectively.
There are discrete clinical and scientific implications of the data presented. First, our data 
confirm the notion that ASF linemen are at substantial risk for the development of 
hypertension. Clinicians who care for ASF athletes should be encouraged to screen for 
hypertension and to implement lifestyle and pharmacologic therapies as suggested by 
current guidelines. Additionally, this study clearly documents position-specific changes in 
blood pressure and cardiac structure and function in response to ASF participation. This 
finding reinforces the notion that not all forms of athletic participation result in similar 
cardiovascular remodeling and for the first time, identifies an athletic population that 
appears to remodel with maladaptive attributes. The cardiovascular changes seen in linemen

 - concentric LVH with reduced GLS -should be viewed as a unique entity from traditional 
“athlete’s heart” with pathologic rather than adaptive characteristics.
Several limitations of this study set the stage for future work. First, we employed a 
longitudinal, repeated measures study design in an effort to establish temporal and causal 
relationships between ASF participation, systolic blood pressure increase, and myocardial 
remodeling. This approach does not however permit definitive determination of underlying 
mechanisms. Future studies examining and controlling for factors including inflammation, 
peripheral vascular dysfunction, distinct cellular pathway activation, and diffuse myocardial 
fibrosis represent logical next steps. Second, we acknowledge that possible confounding 
factors known to impact blood pressure including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, 
psychosocial stress level, and dietary intake were not standardized. Whether these factors 
impacted our data and to what degree efforts to control these factors will benefit ASF 
athletes remains uncertain. Third, our study duration was relatively brief as many athletes 
accrue numerous years of ASF exposure. Carefully designed longer term studies that capture 
blood pressure and cardiac parameters during more lengthy ASF careers and in the post-ASF 
years are warranted. Finally, we acknowledge the potential impact of subject attrition due to 
the unavoidably high rate of participant exclusion from the final analysis (103 of 190 
athletes, 54%) due to injury and technically inadequate echocardiographic images for strain 
analysis. Although there were no differences in baseline parameters, blood pressure trends, 
or prevalent LV hypertrophy among those excluded, we cannot eliminate the possibility of 
some attrition bias.
In conclusion, data from the present study advance our understanding of the cardiovascular 
response to participation in American style football. ASF participants at the lineman field 
position appear to be at risk for incident hypertension and secondary maladaptive cardiac 
remodeling. The development of concentric LV hypertrophy with relative impairment of 
GLS, a phenotype unequivocally associated with adverse prognoses in other clinical 
populations, is concerning in this population of young, otherwise healthy athletes. These 
findings underscore the need for future work designed to confirm the scope and long-term 
clinical implications of this problem which may affect millions of young people.

 Perspectives
Competency in Medical Knowledge
The cardiovascular care of American style football athletes requires specific 
consideration of the unique cardiovascular demands during training and competition in 
this sport. Understanding the effects of football participation on cardiovascular 
remodeling using echocardiography represents an important step in providing more 
specialized long-term care for this group of athletes.
Translational Outlook
Our findings demonstrate that American style football athletes, especially those at a 
lineman position, are at increased risk for early life hypertension and associated 
secondary cardiac remodeling including a decrement in left ventricular systolic function 
as measured by global longitudinal strain. This decrease in function appears to be 
mediated in part by acquired resting hypertension and weight gain highlighting the 
importance of the modifiable factors in mitigating the risk of later life heart disease in 
football linemen.
