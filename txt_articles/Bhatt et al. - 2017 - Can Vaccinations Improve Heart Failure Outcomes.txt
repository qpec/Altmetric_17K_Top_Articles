Abstract
Heart failure (HF) is a chronic syndrome characterized by acute exacerbations. There is significant 
overlap between respiratory infections and exacerbation of underlying HF. Vaccination against 
respiratory infections in HF patients could serve as a potential cost-effective intervention to 
improve patients’ quality of life and clinical outcomes. The benefits of influenza vaccination in 
secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease have been previously studied. However, the 
evidence for influenza and pneumococcal vaccination specifically in the HF population is less well 
established. Furthermore, questions around the optimal timing, dose, frequency, and 
implementation strategies are largely unanswered. This review highlights the current evidence for 
vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia in HF and cardiovascular disease in 
general. It summarizes current understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms in which 
vaccination may provide cardioprotection. Finally, it offers opportunities for further investigation 
of the effects of vaccination in the HF population, including basic science, translational research, 
and large clinical trials.

 Introduction
HF affects approximately 5.7 million American adults, with a prevalence expected to 
increase over time.(1–3) Despite marked pharmacologic and device-based advances for HF 
with reduced ejection fraction (EF) in recent years, HF is associated with significant 
morbidity, mortality, and financial burden. Approximately one half of patients with chronic 
HF have preserved EF, with a prevalence expected to increase with aging of the population.
(4) Outcomes in HF with preserved EF are similarly poor as those with HF with reduced EF. 
Yet, there are no current chronic therapies available improve outcome in this population.
Greater than 50% of HF patients die within five years of diagnosis. HF in the US is 
projected to cost $69.7 billion annually by 2030.(5) There is an unmet need for additional 
interventions, particularly those with a favorable cost-effectiveness profile, in HF 
management.
Recent data support the benefits of vaccination in patients with cardiovascular disease 
including those with atrial arrhythmias.(6,7) However, there are limited data regarding 
potential benefits specifically in patients with HF.
In the present manuscript, we aim to [1] examine the mechanisms by which vaccination may 
improve HF outcomes, [2] summarize the available data on influenza and pneumococcal 
pneumonia vaccination on HF outcomes and patients with HF, and [3] propose future

 research to further characterize the effect of vaccination, including optimal timing and 
dosing strategies, to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes in the HF population.
Methods
To identify additional relevant published data, we searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) from 
January 1990 to July 2016 (Supplemental Material). We used Medical Subject Headings and 
key words, focusing on the most relevant terms for this topic. We manually searched 
reference lists of pertinent studies and background data to find relevant citations that our 
searches might have missed. All citations were imported into an EndNote X7 database. 
Given the limited data on respiratory vaccination in HF, our search strategy included 
observational/retrospective studies and randomized control trials. We required that the 
primary papers include data on outcomes analyses or pragmatic interventions involving the 
use of pneumococcal or influenza vaccination with respect to either a HF cohort and/or HF 
outcomes.
Respiratory Infection, HF, and Available Vaccination
It can often be difficult to distinguish forms of respiratory distress in patients with HF. 
Despite this, significant overlap exists between HF and respiratory disease, with 50% of HF 
exacerbations being triggered by respiratory infections.(8) Large HF registry data has shown 
respiratory infection/pneumonia to be the leading precipitating cause of HF admission, 
associated with high inhospital mortality.(9) Vaccination may reduce the incidence and/or 
severity of respiratory infection, and thereby prevent HF exacerbations, hospitalization, 
excess cost and associated morbidity/mortality; however, these hypotheses have not been 
empirically evaluated.
Major respiratory vaccination efforts in adults have focused on influenza and pneumococcal 
pneumonia. Available influenza/pneumococcal vaccines in the United States are listed in 
Table 1.
Influenza infection is a common illness with substantial morbidity and mortality. 
Vaccination with inactivated, influenza vaccination is estimated to have prevented 
approximately 1.5 million cases and 65,000 hospitalizations in the 2014–2015 influenza 
season.(10) Inactivated influenza vaccination (IIV) formulations can differ in the amount of 
the glycoprotein hemagglutinin (a polysaccharide found on cell membranes) contained in the 
vaccine. The high dose, IIV3-HD vaccine, contains 60ug of hemagglutinin compared to 
15ug in the IIV3-SD standard dose. Hemagglutinin levels correlate with immunogenicity.
(11,12)
Streptococcus pneumoniae accounts for approximately 400,000 hospitalizations annually in 
the US with a high fatality rate.(13) There is an increased risk of pneumococcal pneumonia 
in the post-influenza illness state, through suspected synergistic mechanisms (14,15) Major 
forms of pneumococcal vaccination in the US include the pneumococcal polysaccharide 23-
valent vaccine (Pneumovax or PPSV 23) and the pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate Vaccine 
(Prevnar or PCV13), each with different populations in which they are recommended.

 Current Respiratory Vaccination Guidelines In HF
Guideline recommendations for respiratory vaccination in a HF cohort are limited. The 2005 
CDC report recommended routine yearly, inactivated influenza vaccination in adults with 
chronic cardiovascular disease, including HF.(18) These recommendations are supported by 
major cardiology societies (Class I, Level B).(19,20) The Heart Failure Society of America 
recommends yearly influenza vaccination specifically in HF patients without 
contraindications (Level B), as does the European Society of Cardiology.(21,22) Full 
respiratory vaccination guidelines in cardiovascular disease are listed in Table 2.
Mechanisms of Proposed Cardiovascular Protection
Prior research has investigated the molecular mechanisms of cardioprotection from 
respiratory vaccination. Major mechanisms for vaccine-induced cardioprotection are shown 
in the Central Illustration.
Respiratory infection induced inflammatory propagation may accelerate atherogenesis and 
impair ionotropy. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-
alpha (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein up-regulate the expression of cell adhesion molecules 
on the endothelial surface, promoting transmigration of leukocytes into the vascular intima. 
This is a necessary process for lipoprotein oxidation, part of the atherogenic cascade. (23,24)
The production of TNF-α and interleukin-1-beta during acute illness can independently 
depress myocyte contractility.(25–29). Specifically, mechanisms include activation of a 
sphingomyelinase pathway and alter a nitric oxide pathway, which impairs the beta-
adrenergic responsiveness of cardiac myocytes.(28,30–32) Sustained cytokine expression 
can lead to adverse myocardial remodeling and excess production of tissue inhibitors of 
matrix metalloproteinases. In murine models, inoculation of atherosclerotic apolipoprotein-E 
(apoE)–deficient mice with influenza A results in an influx of inflammatory cells, fibrin 
deposition, and thrombosis.(33) These processes have been linked to left ventricular 
dilatation and increases in myocardial collagen content, contributing to the HF phenotype. 
(28). Influenza vaccination has been theorized to prevent the adverse impact of infection/
inflammation on myocardial contractility, fibrosis, and atherogenesis.(34,35)
The conjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination directly may inhibit the formation 
of atherogenesis via impairing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. In murine models, 
pneumococcal vaccination reduced aortic root atherosclerosis by 40% at 30 weeks by a 
process thought to involve molecular mimicry.(36,37)
Pneumococcal vaccination leads to the production of IgM antibodies that share binding sites 
with naturally occurring anti-oxLDL antibodies. Specifically, both antibodies recognize the 
phosphorylcholine epitope on oxidized LDL. Competitive inhibition of anti-oxLDL – 
phosphorylcholine binding may slow the macrophage uptake of oxidized LDL, a process 
upstream of foam cell and plaque formation. (36,37) Data is promising but currently limited 
to a few studies in murine models and has not been verified in clinical research.

 A direct link between vaccination-induced reduction in atherogenesis and the HF phenotype 
is not yet clearly established, though it would be theorized to reduce the incidence and 
progression of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Given these proposed mechanisms, further 
investigation should be conducted to understand differential responses to vaccination in 
those with ischemic vs. non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Respiratory Vaccination Rates in HF
Despite health campaigns and media attention aimed at improving vaccination rates, the rate 
of respiratory vaccination in patients with HF remains low.(38) A prospective analysis at 
Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, FL showed baseline influenza and pneumococcal 
vaccination rates to be 28.3% and 30.7% respectively in a primarily indigent population with 
reduced left ventricular EF. Despite enrollment in an outpatient HF disease management 
program, 18% of this population refused influenza vaccination.(38) The most common 
reason for patient refusal was fear that vaccination would cause influenza illness.
Recent evidence from the Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact 
on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM-HF) trial found similar 
vaccination rates in a chronic HF population with reduced EF.(39) This post-hoc analysis 
found influenza vaccination rates of 21% in the overall study cohort of over 8,000 
participants across North and South America, Asia, and Europe. Vaccination rates in the 
United States were 55%, significantly higher than the study average, but over 20% lower 
than countries such as Great Britain, Netherlands, and Belgium.(39) Predictors of 
vaccination included older age, white race, and interestingly, lower NYHA functional class.
Influenza Vaccination and HF Outcomes
Prior data highlight the adverse effects of pulmonary infections on patients with 
cardiovascular (CV) disease and suggest the potential utility of vaccination in improving 
outcomes. Major trials have focused primarily an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 
population; HF outcomes in these trials are limited. A summary of major findings in 
randomized control trials in cardiovascular disease is listed in Table 3.
The Flu Vaccination Acute Coronary Syndromes (FLUVACS) study randomized 301 
patients to receive the influenza vaccine versus no vaccination in patients admitted for 
myocardial infarction (MI) or planned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 
Argentina. Subgroup analysis did not investigate the HF population specifically. The primary 
endpoint of cardiovascular mortality was lower in the vaccination group compared to 
controls.(40) Notably, fatal and non-fatal HF events were zero in both the vaccination and 
control groups. Reasons for low event rates include a relatively short follow-up (12 months) 
and small sample size.
Similarly, the Influenza Vaccination In Secondary Prevention From Coronary Ischemic 
Events In Coronary Artery Disease (FLUCAD) trial showed a reduction in ischemic events 
in 658 Polish patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD). (41) FLUCAD excluded 
patient with NYHA II/IV HF. The prevalence of HF was only 12.9% and 15.9% in the 
vaccination and placebo groups respectively. Again, no fatal or non-fatal HF events were

 noted in the two groups. Limited follow-up and low incidence of influenza illness in Poland 
during the 2004/2005 season may have contributed to the low events rates. High rates of 
antigenic similarity between the trivalent vaccine used in the trial and the influenza strains 
isolated in the community (59% similar) may have contributed to a decreased overall 
influenza incidence.
Another randomized placebo-controlled trial of 439 post-ACS patients found no difference 
in cardiovascular death rates, though significant benefit in the vaccine group on the 
composite secondary outcome of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for ACS, HF, or 
stroke.(42) There was no difference in HF hospitalizations (1.8 vs. 4.6%, RR 0.9 (0.49–
1.01), P = 0.111.) A 2013 meta-analysis of six trials that followed 6735 patients for a mean 
duration of 8 months supported the findings of Phrommintikul et. al. (43) Only two of the 
included trials had >0 events for fatal and non-fatal HF, with both failing to show significant 
reductions in the vaccination group.
Large epidemiological studies pooling managed care data support vaccination-induced 
prevention of HF hospitalization in elderly.(44–46) A study of 140,000 patients in the 1998–
1999 and 1999–2000 influenza seasons found a 19% overall reduction in CV hospitalization 
in the vaccinated group compared to controls. There were 72 fewer hospitalizations for HF 
in the vaccination cohort during the 1998–1999 season (absolute risk reduction 0.3%), 
though this trend was not seen in the 1999–2000 season. (44) Davis et. al. found a stronger 
relationship in HF hospitalization prevention (OR 0.8, CI 0.7–0.9). (45) Prevention of HF 
admissions are estimated to have significant direct medical cost savings, up to $235 per 
individual vaccinated. (46)
Influenza Vaccination In a HF Population
The impact of vaccination in a HF population is incompletely studied. Most vaccination 
trials either have not enrolled HF patients or not assessed impact in a HF cohort sub-study.
Recent evidence from PARADIGM-HF found that influenza vaccination was associated with 
a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in a cohort of patients with reduced LVEF (hazard ratio: 
0.81, 95% CI: 0.67–0.97).(39) In propensity adjusted models, the composite outcome of CV 
death and HF hospitalization did not reach statistical significance, though there was a signal 
toward clinical benefit in the vaccinated group. Perhaps limited long-term follow-up could 
explains these findings, as a cohort analysis of 1964 HF patients found no association with 
influenza vaccine and 1-year all cause mortality, but the relationship showed significant 
benefit in the vaccination group when 4-year mortality was used as the clinical endpoint.(47) 
A recent self-controlled case series of HF patients (regardless of LVEF) utilized complex 
regression to compare individuals in vaccination years to themselves in adjacent non-
vaccination years.(48) Acknowledging the risk for confounding and seasonality in this 
analysis, the study found influenza vaccination was associated with reductions in all cause 
hospitalization and cardiovascular hospitalization. No randomized control trial data 
comparing influenza vaccination to placebo exists exclusively in a HF population. No 
randomized control trial data comparing influenza vaccination to placebo exists exclusively 
in a HF population.

 What is the appropriate dose of influenza vaccine in HF?
Current CDC guidelines offer either an age-appropriate standard-dose IIV or high-dose IIV 
in patients 65 years or older.(49) Recent evidence has suggested a clinical benefit of high 
dose vaccination in this age group.(50) Patients with HF may have decreased immune 
responses to standard dose vaccination, suggesting the possible utility of high-dose 
vaccination in this population.(51) Higher immunogenicity, quantified by hemagglutinin 
inhibition assay titer levels, has been seen in patients receiving the high-dose vaccine. 
(11,12)
Given the significant morbidity associated with HF, questions remain as to whether this 
population would benefit from high-dose IIV. In one randomized pilot study of 28 patients 
with HF, individuals received either standard dose vaccination (15ug hemagglutinin) versus 
double dose vaccination (30ug hemagglutinin). Double dose vaccination produced 
significantly higher immunogenicity. The study did not assess dose response with respect to 
clinical outcomes, such as laboratory-confirmed influenza or HF exacerbation. (52) 
Unexpectedly. stratification by age did not show significant differences in immunogenicity 
for patients > 70 years of age. Our understanding of influenza vaccination dose variation in 
HF is currently limited to a single small study, though a larger, randomized, clinical trial is 
currently enrolling.
Pneumococcal Vaccination and Cardiovascular Outcomes
Acute bacterial pneumonia has been linked to HF and increased cardiovascular events. A 
small case series found that 14% of patients admitted for pneumococcal pneumonia had new 
or worsening HF at the time of admission. (53) As a recent meta-analysis found no suitable 
randomized control trial evidence on the effects of pneumococcal vaccination on 
cardiovascular events, our current understanding of this potential relationship is limited to 
observational and retrospective analyses. (54)
A large retrospective case-control study from Canada evaluated 20,000 inpatients from 
1997–2003 at high risk for coronary events. High-risk status was defined as preexisting 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia in men >45 years and women> 50 years.
(55) Patients vaccinated >2 years prior to admission had significantly lower rates of 
myocardial infarction (MI). Rates of HF were not assessed between groups. Clinically 
important confounding variables such as smoking status, medication use, obesity, diet, and 
exercise were not controlled for in the analysis. In contrast, an analysis of the California 
Men’s Health Study found no difference in the incidence of MI and stroke in patients 
vaccinated with PPSV23 versus those not vaccinated.(56) Findings were controlled for 
dietary, lifestyle and disease state factors. The incidence of HF was actually lower in the 
unvaccinated group. Neither of these analyses specifically enrolled a specific HF population. 
The paucity of high-level evidence on the clinical outcomes associated with pneumococcal 
vaccination in HF presents an opportunity for further investigation.

 Future Directions
While preliminary evidence suggests protective effect of vaccination in HF patients, data are 
limited and not systematically or consistently validated. Significant opportunities, across 
basic, translational and clinical research, exist for further study (Table 4).
A deeper understanding of current vaccination practices within the HF population is 
necessary to guide population-level interventions aimed at improving vaccination rates. 
Currently, our understanding of vaccination rates in HF is limited to a small prospective 
analysis and trial subanalysis.(38,39) This data suggests differences in vaccination rates 
between different demographical groups (race, sex, socioeconomic status). Further 
understanding of disparities in vaccination rates should involve the use of large registry data, 
which would also allow for a temporal outlook. Differential rates of vaccination by cardiac 
and non-cardiac comorbidities (diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) should be 
accessed given guidelines for vaccination in these populations.(16,17)
It may be time for a large, multicenter trial to understand the clinical outcomes of respiratory 
vaccination in the HF population. Previous observational analyses have focused on HF with 
reduced EF. The reality is that HF is a broad clinical syndrome with multiple variants, each 
with their own manifestations, treatment, and natural histories. The trial should enroll a 
broader study population, inclusive of reduced and preserved EF, ischemic and non-ischemic 
cardiomyopathy. Authors propose that as atherogenesis prevention is a major proposed 
cardioprotective mechanism of vaccination, patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and 
reduced ejection fraction may derive the greatest benefit from vaccination. Primary 
endpoints could include a composite of cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalizations. 
Secondary outcomes measures could include total number of hospitalizations, HF 
readmissions, and measures of cardiovascular morbidity, functional status, and quality of 
life.
A comparison of outcomes in HF patients randomized to receive the standard dose vs. high 
dose influenza vaccine is already being undertaken in scientifically rigorous ways. The 
VACC-HeFT feasibility trial plans to assess humoral response and secondarily all-cause 
hospitalization. The large scale, randomized clinical trial, INVESTED, plans to enroll 9,300 
patients from North America, observed over multiple influenza seasons. The trial will 
randomize patients to receive standard vs. high dose influenza vaccination. Primary 
endpoints include all-cause mortality and cardiopulmonary hospitalizations in patients with 
recent MI or HF. Such rigorous designs should be employed to answer other pertinent 
questions, such as the optimal timing of vaccination and the need for revaccination in 
pneumococcal disease prevention.
Patients with HF interact with healthcare systems in multiple settings in many places. This 
dispersion makes implementation of vaccination campaigns a challenge, and raises questions 
about the optimal timing, setting and personnel needed to drive high rates of vaccination. 
Designing in-hospital based vaccination systems and campaigns may provide 
epidemiological advantages. (57) Given data that many patients seek specialists even for 
preventative care, heart failure disease management programs may be the optimal setting for 
Bhatt et al.

 vaccination enforcement.(58) As more evidence emerges, patient and provider-specific 
incentive structures established in other clinical settings should be developed and trialed in 
HF. (59,60) While empiric validation of these implementation strategies would have a high 
initial investment, there is the potential for large impacts on the way we deliver cost–
effective preventative care in HF that would likely result in net value.
Conclusion
Influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia are two common infectious conditions with 
significant associated morbidity and mortality. There are proposed mechanisms that 
contribute to the HF phenotype in patients with bacterial and viral infection. There is a 
suggestion that influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia vaccination may have a protective 
role in patients with HF. Vaccination represents a low-cost intervention that may be able to 
preventing the significant morbidity, mortality, and system-wide cost associated with HF. 
Large-scale, clinical trial data are limited in determining the true risks and benefits of 
vaccination specifically in the HF population. There is significant opportunity for broad 
areas of further investigation in determining how vaccination can improve outcomes and 
quality of life in patients with HF.

 Central Illustration. Proposed Cardioprotective Mechanisms of Vaccination
Pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in vaccination-induced cardioprotection include 
inhibition of oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake by molecular mimicry from 
pneumococcal vaccination-induced antibodiy production and the attenuation of chronic 
inflammation, a pro-atherogenic process, in influenza vaccination. TNF-a = tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha, IL-1B = interleukin 1-beta, LDL = low-density lipoprotein, MMP = matrix 
metalloproteinases, NO = nitric oxide.
