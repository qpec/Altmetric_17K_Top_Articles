IMPORTANCE Numerous states have pending physician-aided dying (PAD) legislation. Little
research has been done regarding use of PAD, or ways to improve the process and/or results.
OBJECTIVES To evaluate results of Oregon PAD, the longest running US program; to
disseminate results; and to determine promising PAD research areas.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective observational cohort study of 991
Oregon residents who had prescriptions written as part of the state’
s Death with Dignity Act.
We reviewed publicly available data from Oregon Health Authority reports from 1998 to
2015, and made a supplemental information request to the Oregon Health Authority.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number of deaths from self-administration of lethal
medication versus number of prescriptions written.
RESULTS A total of 1545 prescriptions were written, and 991 patients died by using legally
prescribed lethal medication. Of the 991 patients, 509 (51.4%) were men and 482 (48.6%)
were women. The median age was 71 years (range, 25-102 years). The number of prescriptions
written increased annually (from 24 in 1998 to 218 in 2015), and the percentage of prescription
recipients dying by this method per year averaged 64%. Of the 991 patients using lethal
self-medication, 762 (77%) recipients had cancer, 79 (8%) had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
44 (4.5%) had lung disease, 26 (2.6%) had heart disease, and 9 (0.9%) had HIV. Of 991
patients, 52 (5.3%) were sent for psychiatric evaluation to assess competence. Most (953;
96.6%) patients were white and 865 (90.5%) were in hospice care. Most (118, 92.2%) patients
had insurance and 708 (71.9%) had at least some college education. Most (94%) died at home.
The estimated median time between medication intake and coma was 5 minutes (range, 1-38
minutes); to death it was 25 minutes (range, 1-6240 minutes). Thirty-three (3.3%) patients
had known complications. The most common reasons cited for desiring PAD were activities of
daily living were not enjoyable (89.7%) and losses of autonomy (91.6%) and dignity (78.7%);
inadequate pain control contributed in 25.2% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The number of PAD prescriptions written in Oregon has
increased annually since legislation enactment. Patients use PAD for reasons related to
quality of life, autonomy, and dignity, and rarely for uncontrolled pain. Many questions remain
regarding usage and results, making this area suitable for cancer care delivery research.

 P
hysician aid-in-dying (PAD) refers to a physician pro-
viding a terminally ill patient with a prescription for a
lethal dose of medication that the patient intends to use
to end his or her own life.1 Oregon put forth the Death with Dig-
nity Act (DWDA) in 1994, and it became law in 1997. Oregon
was the first state to enact such legislation.
The act has requirements protecting prescribers and us-
ers from civil and criminal liability. All PAD candidates must
(1) be Oregon residents (duration unspecified), (2) be certi-
fied by 2 physicians to have a life expectancy of less than 6
months, (3) have drugs prescribed by an MD or DO licensed in
Oregon, (4) be capable of making and communicating health
care decisions for themselves, and (5) be able to self-
administer the medication.2 The patient must make 2 oral re-
quests and 1 written request for PAD, over a minimum period
of 15 days. Alternatives, including comfort care, hospice, and
pain control are offered. Patients are told at several points that
they may rescind the request.
The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) is legally obligated to
collect compliance and prescribing information, and it pro-
duces an annual report that includes basic demographic in-
formation, the number of prescriptions written, and the num-
ber of patients taking the lethal medication.3 Requests for
additional data may be made. Patient confidentiality is guar-
anteed, and the OHA will not disclose whether an individual
physician participates.
We examined DWDA data to determine usage and effec-
tiveness, and to gauge promising cancer care delivery re-
search areas.
Methods
We reviewed OHA website reports from 1998 to 2015.3 We also
made a supplemental data request to the state concerning the
numbers of physicians participating and prescriptions writ-
ten per physician. Summary data, including user demograph-
ics, medication efficacy and toxic effects, and underlying rea-
sons for patients requesting and using PAD, were gathered.
These data, including patient ethnicity and time to coma and
death, were assessed by the prescribing physician.
We compared trends in death rates vs prescriptions writ-
ten using logistic regression.4 These were also evaluated using
Poisson regression, adjusting for temporal changes in the Or-
egon population.5

Key Points
Question How is physician-aided dying being used in Oregon?
Findings In this analysis of publicly available data, about
two-thirds of patients prescribed lethal medication under
Oregon’
s Death with Dignity act consumed the medication and
subsequently died. Cancer was the most common underlying
disease.
Meaning Physician aid-in-dying makes up only a small fraction of
Oregon resident deaths, accounting for 38.6 deaths per 10 000
total deaths, but it offers considerable potential benefits to many
patients who are near the end of their life.

 an annual average increase of 12.1% (from 24 to 121 over the
entire period), and during 2014 and 2015 it increased by
28% to 41% (121 in 2014 and 218 in 2015). The ratio of
prescriptions written per year, to the number of patients
dying from self-administration, ranged from 0.48 to 0.82
(median, 0.64), with no significant trend observed over
time (Figure). Three-hundred thirty-six physicians wrote
DWDA prescriptions, averaging 3.4 total prescriptions each
(range, 1-71).
Of 991 patients, 52 (5.3%) were referred to psychiatrists for
determination of competence. Forty-six (4.7%) were in long-
term care facilities when they self-administered, and 1 indi-
vidual was a hospital inpatient. Physicians were present at the
time of ingestion in 148 cases (16.1%). Between 2001 and 2015,
855 (93.5%) patients notified families of their intention to use
DWDA medication, and 928 (94.0%) took the medicine at
home.
Pure pentobarbital was a commonly used lethal drug un-
til it became unavailable in 2012.6 Secobarbital use ac-
counted for 580 (58.5%) deaths.
Information on drug effectiveness and complications was
requested on all patients from 1998 to 2010; after that only in
cases when a health care provider was present at the time of
death. The median time to coma was 5 minutes (range, 1-38
minutes). Patients rarely remained unconscious for long pe-
riods; median time to death was 25 minutes, but the range was
1 minute to more than 4 days. The medications were rela-
tively devoid of unexpected toxic effects. Vomiting was un-
usual (24 patients, 2.4%). Six patients awakened, giving the
medications an efficacy rate of 99.4%.
Cancer was the most common underlying terminal ill-
ness, with 762 (77.1%) patients (Table). Seventy-nine (8.0%)
patients had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 44 (4.5%) and
26 (2.6%), respectively, had incurable lung and heart disease.
Nine patients (0.9%) had HIV or AIDS. Lung cancer was the
most common malignant abnormality, with 177 (17.9%) cases,
andbreastcancerwasthesecondmostfrequent,with73(7.4%)
patients.
Sex was relatively evenly divided, with 509 men (51.4%)
and 482 (48.6%) women dying. Most of those dying (953,
96.6%) were white. Ninety-four patients (approximately 10%)
were aged younger than 55 years. The youngest was 25. There
were 145 (14.6%) patients who were 85 years or older and the
eldest recorded user of DWDA medication was 102 years old.
The median age was 71 years.
Most (865, 90.5%) patients were enrolled in hospice and
had insurance. Most (708 71.9%) had at least some college
education.
Patients had a variety of reasons for requesting DWDA
medication, as assessed by the prescribing physician.
Nine-hundred three (92%) perceived loss of autonomy. Of
897 patients, 885 patients (89.7%) were unable to partici-
pate in enjoyable activities, and 677 (78.7%) cited loss of
dignity. Few (474, 48.2%) worried about control of bodily
functions. Two hundred forty-eight (25.2%) patients stated
inadequate pain control contributed to their decision. A
minority (30; 3.1%) of patients were concerned about treat-
ment costs.
Discussion
Other studies have surveyed physician and patient attitudes
toward PAD and described patient demographics in the United
States and Europe,7 but this work is more detailed in terms of
providing data on prescriptions received, patients consum-
ing the lethal medications, and actual deaths. Oregon itself has
the longest US experience with PAD. This study describes us-
age over the life of the Oregon DWDA and, to our knowledge,
it is the most inclusive to date. Review of this period during

 which PAD has been legal is quite revealing and might guide
future efforts to legalize PAD and/or help physicians caring for
terminally ill patients.
We found that approximately two-thirds of patients hav-
ing prescriptions written took the lethal medication(s), and
nearly all died (>99%) when they did so. Cancer was the most
common underlying terminal disease.
Though the rate of prescriptions written annually has
increased steadily, this was not a result of simple growth in
the Oregon resident population or increases in cancer death
rates—both increasing by approximately 1.0% from 2014 to
2015 (Figure). Presumably the increase was at least in part
related to further social acceptance of the DWDA. Notably,
PAD deaths still make up well below 0.5% of citizen mortal-
ity in Oregon.
Inadequate symptom palliation has been cited as a rea-
son patients seek PAD. Patients’end-of-life concerns appear
difficult to palliate, however; the most commonly cited rea-
sons for taking lethal medications were loss of autonomy and
dignity, and inability to enjoy life. A minority (248, 25.2%) of
cases were associated with inadequate pain control, though
that figure should be lower. In addition, although few pa-
tients were referred for psychiatric evaluation with questions
of competency, increasing access to therapists and counsel-
ing for other purposes (eg, meaning-centered group psycho-
therapy, which has been demonstrated to improve spiritual
well-being and end-of-life sense of meaning), could substan-
tially help patients considering PAD.8
Limitations
The quality of our data is limited by the fact the attending phy-
sicians supplied the state with the underlying information
(ie, primary records, such as death certificates, were not
checked).Inaddition,becausethephysiciansattestedtothepa-
tients’reasons for requesting DWD there is no way to ascertain
whether the questioning of the patient was comprehensive.
Conclusions
We believe PAD is a promising area for formal, prospective re-
search. Capturing more information on patients considering it
(eg, how many had an underlying diagnosis of depression,
whether tumors were primary or recurrent, and time since di-
agnosis) would be of great interest in guiding cancer care de-
livery research. It would be helpful to understand why patients
prescribed lethal medications do or do not take them, whether
an algorithm can be derived to advise patients on how long the
medications will require to work, and whether we can better
palliate end-of-life concerns, avoiding or delaying PAD.
