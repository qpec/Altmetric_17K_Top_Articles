IMPORTANCE Human genetic studies have indicated that plasma lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is
causally associated with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), but randomized trials of
several therapies that reduce Lp(a) levels by 25% to 35% have not provided any evidence
that lowering Lp(a) level reduces CHD risk.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the magnitude of the change in plasma Lp(a) levels needed to have
the same evidence of an association with CHD risk as a 38.67-mg/dL (ie, 1-mmol/L) change in
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level, a change that has been shown to produce a
clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of CHD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A mendelian randomization analysis was conducted
using individual participant data from 5 studies and with external validation using
summarized data from 48 studies. Population-based prospective cohort and case-control
studies featured 20 793 individuals with CHD and 27 540 controls with individual participant
data, whereas summarized data included 62 240 patients with CHD and 127 299 controls.
Data were analyzed from November 2016 to March 2018.
EXPOSURES Genetic LPA score and plasma Lp(a) mass concentration.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Coronary heart disease.
RESULTS Of the included study participants, 53% were men, all were of white European
ancestry, and the mean age was 57.5 years. The association of genetically predicted Lp(a) with
CHD risk was linearly proportional to the absolute change in Lp(a) concentration. A 10-mg/dL
lower genetically predicted Lp(a) concentration was associated with a 5.8% lower CHD risk
(odds ratio [OR], 0.942; 95% CI, 0.933-0.951; P = 3 × 10−37), whereas a 10-mg/dL lower
genetically predicted LDL-C level estimated using an LDL-C genetic score was associated with
a 14.5% lower CHD risk (OR, 0.855; 95% CI, 0.818-0.893; P = 2 × 10−12). Thus, a 101.5-mg/dL
change (95% CI, 71.0-137.0) in Lp(a) concentration had the same association with CHD risk as
a 38.67-mg/dL change in LDL-C level. The association of genetically predicted Lp(a)
concentration with CHD risk appeared to be independent of changes in LDL-C level owing to
genetic variants that mimic the relationship of statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and ezetimibe with
CHD risk.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The clinical benefit of lowering Lp(a) is likely to be
proportional to the absolute reduction in Lp(a) concentration. Large absolute reductions in
Lp(a) of approximately 100 mg/dL may be required to produce a clinically meaningful
reduction in the risk of CHD similar in magnitude to what can be achieved by lowering LDL-C
level by 38.67 mg/dL (ie, 1 mmol/L).

 A
polipoprotein(a),whichisencodedbytheLPAgene,co-
valently binds to a cholesterol-rich low-density lipo-
protein (LDL) particle to form lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]).1
Meta-analyses of prospective observational studies have re-
ported that higher plasma Lp(a) concentration is associated
with dose-dependent higher risk of coronary heart disease
(CHD).2Furthermore,mendelianrandomizationanalyseshave
provided strong evidence that the association between Lp(a)
and risk of CHD is likely to be causal.3-5 However, several large
randomized trials evaluating therapies that lower Lp(a) con-
centration by between 20% and 35% (including niacin, cho-
lesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors, and PCSK9 inhibi-
tors) have not provided clear evidence that lowering plasma
Lp(a) concentration reduces the risk of cardiovascular events
beyond that which would be expected from the observed LDL-
loweringeffectofthesetherapies.6-11Althoughthesetrialswere
not specifically designed to assess the Lp(a)-lowering effect of
these agents, these trials raise the question of how much Lp(a)
concentration must be lowered to produce a clinically mean-
ingful reduction in cardiovascular events. Therapies that more
specifically and potently lower Lp(a) concentrations by up to
90% by inhibiting apolipoprotein(a) synthesis are in
development.12 Whether lowering Lp(a) concentrations with
these new therapies will reduce the risk of cardiovascular
events is unknown.
Owing to the skewed distribution of plasma Lp(a) concen-
tration, prior studies have reported the association between
log-transformed concentrations of Lp(a) and CHD risk.2,13-15
Changesinlog-transformedLp(a)concentrationsrepresentpro-
portional changes in Lp(a) concentrations. However, propor-
tional reduction is not a useful metric for assessing the poten-
tial clinical benefit of lowering Lp(a) level because
concentrations can vary by as much as 1000-fold among mem-
bers of the same population, and therefore, the same propor-
tional change in Lp(a) concentration can result in markedly dif-
ferent absolute changes, depending on the initial Lp(a)
concentration.16
Importantly, statins and other therapies that reduce LDL
particle concentrations are associated with a dose-
dependent reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events that
is determined by the absolute (rather than the proportional)
changeinLDLcholesterol(LDL-C)level.17-19BecauseLp(a)con-
tains an LDL particle, we hypothesized that there would be evi-
dence to support a clinical association of Lp(a) with the risk
of CHD that may also be proportional to the absolute change
in circulating Lp(a) mass concentration. To test this hypoth-
esis, we created a genetic score to estimate the magnitude and
shape of the relationship of Lp(a) with the risk of CHD. We then
estimated the absolute change in plasma Lp(a) concentration
required to achieve the equivalent change in CHD risk as a
38.67-mg/dL (ie, 1-mmol/L) change in LDL-C level (to convert
to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259), a change in LDL-C
that has been demonstrated to produce a clinically meaning-
ful 20% to 25% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events
in short-term trials.17-19 Our objective was to make inferences
about how much Lp(a) concentration must be reduced phar-
macologically to produce a clinically meaningful reduction in
CHD risk and thereby determine who is most likely to benefit
from treatment with Lp(a)-lowering therapy to inform clini-
cal guidelines and the design of randomized trials evaluating
Lp(a)-lowering therapies.
Methods
Study Population and Outcomes
We studied 48 333 participants of European descent (includ-
ing 20 793 with CHD) from 5 studies for whom individual
participant–level data were available as part of the CHD
Exome+ Consortium. Descriptions of the included studies are
provided in eMethods 1 of the Supplement. The primary out-
come was CHD, defined as CHD death, nonfatal myocardial in-
farction, or (for 3 of the studies) other coronary events with
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
HealthProblems,TenthRevisioncodesI20-25.Participantspro-
vided written informed consent for genetic studies. As this was
an analysis of anonymized data that had already been col-
lected, ethical approval was not sought for this particular in-
vestigation.
LPA Genetic Score
All CHD Exome+ Consortium participants were genotyped
using a customized version of the Illumina Exome Beadchip
array, which included ultrafine mapping of the LPA gene re-
gion involving 2426 variants genotyped within a 660-kb win-
dow (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). To select variants for in-
clusion in the genetic score, we identified variants in the LPA
gene region that were conditionally associated with Lp(a) con-
centrationsatagenome-widelevelofsignificance(P < 5 × 10−8)
usingforwardstepwiseregressionamongparticipantsfreefrom
CHD at baseline in each study. We adjusted for study, age, sex,
and 5 principal components of ancestry. Genetic variants cor-
related with a selected variant at r2 greater than 0.4 were ex-
cluded from further steps of the procedure (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). For each participant, we calculated a weighted
genetic score by summing the number of Lp(a)-raising alleles
inherited at each variant included in the score, weighted by
each variant’
s association with absolute change in Lp(a) mass
Key Points
Question How much does plasma lipoprotein(a) need to be
lowered to produce a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of
coronary heart disease?
Findings In a mendelian randomization analysis involving more
than 80 000 patients and more than 150 000 controls, coronary
heart disease risk was proportionally associated with the absolute
change in plasma lipoprotein(a) mass concentration; a
101.5-mg/dL change in lipoprotein(a) concentration was
associated with the same coronary heart disease risk as a
38.67-mg/dL (ie, 1-mmol/L) change in low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol level.
Meaning Lipoprotein(a) concentration must be lowered by
approximately 100 mg/dL to achieve the same reduction in
coronary heart disease risk as can be achieved by lowering
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 38.67 mg/dL.

 concentration (measured in milligrams per deciliter). In sen-
sitivity analyses, we repeated the primary analyses using dif-
ferent choices of variants in the genetic scores, as described
in eMethods 2 in the Supplement.
Study Design
To assess the dose-response shape of the association be-
tweengeneticallypredictedLp(a)andCHDrisk,wedividedpar-
ticipants into deciles of the genetic score and measured the as-
sociation between each decile of genetically predicted Lp(a)
concentration and the risk of CHD using the first decile as the
reference group. Informed by the shape of the association, we
estimated the association between the LPA score and the risk
of CHD for absolute changes in Lp(a) concentration.
To estimate the absolute reduction in Lp(a) concentra-
tion required to have the same change in CHD risk as a 38.67-
mg/dL decrease in LDL-C level, we used the following proto-
col (eFigure 3 in the Supplement). First, we measured the
association between the LPA score and the risk of CHD per 10-
mg/dL decrease in genetically predicted Lp(a) concentration.
Next, we measured the association between a genetic score
consisting of variants in or near genes that encode the targets
of currently available LDL-C–lowering therapies and CHD risk
per 10-mg/dL decrease in genetically predicted LDL-C (eTable
1 in the Supplement).20 We then calculated the ratio between
these 2 estimates to obtain the change in Lp(a) concentration
that has an equivalent association with CHD risk as a 1-mg/dL
change in LDL-C level. To estimate the amount Lp(a) concen-
trationmustbereducedtohavethesameassociationwithCHD
risk as a 38.67-mg/dL reduction in LDL-C level, we multiplied
this ratio by 38.67. Finally, we estimated the predicted short-
term change associated with different magnitudes of pharma-
cological lowering of Lp(a) concentration by converting the
change in Lp(a) concentration into a change in LDL-C level hav-
ing an equivalent predicted effect on CHD risk and using the
estimated change associated with statin treatment per 38.67-
mg/dL reduction in LDL-C level, as reported by the Choles-
terol Treatment Trialists’Collaboration.17
Statistical Analyses
We estimated the association of each variant with Lp(a) or
LDL-C concentration using linear regression and with CHD risk
using logistic regression. All regression analyses were per-
formed separately in each of the studies, adjusting for age, sex,
and the first 5 principal components of ancestry; these esti-
mates were combined across studies in a fixed-effects in-
verse variance-weighted meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was as-
sessed using the I2 statistic. Mendelian randomization
estimates were then obtained from these variant-specific es-
timates using a previously reported method that accounts for
correlation between variants.21 Nonlinearity in the mende-
lian randomization estimates of the shape of the association
of Lp(a) change with the risk of CHD was assessed using frac-
tional polynomials, as described elsewhere.22 For external rep-
lication in an independent sample, we performed the same
analyses using summarized genetic associations with CHD risk
from the Coronary Artery Disease Genome Wide Replication
and Meta-analysis (CARDIOGRAM) plus The Coronary Artery
Disease (C4D) Genetics (CARDIOGRAMplusC4D) consortium
in up to 62 240 patients and 127 299 controls.23
All analyses were performed using the statistical soft-
ware platform R version 3.4.1 (R Programming). A detailed de-
scription of the methods is provided in eMethods 2 of the
Supplement.
Results
Participant Characteristics
The baseline characteristics of participants are presented in
Table 1. Across the 5 studies contributing to the initial sample,
the median Lp(a) concentration varied from 13.6 mg/dL to 43.3
mg/dL (eTable 2 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
LPA Genetic Score
The stepwise selection procedure identified 43 genetic vari-
antsconditionallyassociatedwithLp(a)(eTable3intheSupple-
ment). The genetic score comprising these variants ex-
plained 51% to 63% of the variance in Lp(a) concentration in
each study (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). This explanatory
ability is lower than observed previously24 because our ge-
netic score was constructed conservatively to minimize bias
owing to overfitting. Associations of each variant with Lp(a)
concentration and CHD risk are displayed in Figure 1.

 sure–outcome association for log-transformed CHD risk was
approximately linear, ie, fixed changes in absolute Lp(a)
concentrations led to equal odds ratios (ORs) for CHD regard-
less of the starting Lp(a) concentration (Figure 2A). By
contrast, the exposure–outcome association for deciles of
log-transformed Lp(a) concentration was curvilinear
(Figure 2B), with fixed proportional changes in Lp(a) concen-
trations leading to greater log-ORs for individuals with higher
baseline Lp(a) concentrations (and hence, increasingly greater
absolute changes in Lp[a] concentrations). These findings are
consistent and support the hypothesis that the risk of CHD is
log-linearly proportional to absolute changes in Lp(a) concen-
tration.
Overall, each 10-mg/dL lower genetically predicted Lp(a)
level was associated with a 5.8% lower risk of CHD (OR, 0.942;
95% CI, 0.933-0.951; P = 3 × 10−37). There was no evidence of
heterogeneity with similar genetic association estimates ob-
tained across all studies independent of the type of Lp(a) as-
say used (eFigures 6 and 7 in the Supplement). Estimates were
also similar in sensitivity analyses that varied the number of
genetic variants included in the LPA score (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). In external replication analyses involving par-
ticipants from CARDIOGRAMplusC4D, a 10-mg/dL lower ge-
neticallypredictedLp(a)levelwasassociatedwitha5.2%lower
risk of CHD (OR, 0.948; 95% CI, 0.941-0.955; P = 1 × 10−47).

Changes in genetically predicted Lp(a) and LDL-C concen-
trations represent lifelong exposure to these lipoproteins.
Hence, to estimate the effect of lowering Lp(a) concentration
in a short-term trial, we assumed that if lifelong exposure to
101.5-mg/dL lower Lp(a) concentration has the same associa-
tion with CHD risk as lifelong exposure to 38.67-mg/dL lower
LDL-C level, then short-term exposure to 101.5-mg/dL lower
Lp(a)concentrationshouldhavethesameassociationwithCHD

elsobservedinrandomizedtrials.Thisassumptionisvalidonly
if changes in Lp(a) concentration and LDL-C level have simi-
lar cumulative associations with CHD over time. It is further
supported by the observation that the ratio of the association
of lifelong exposure to Lp(a) with CHD risk estimated from
mendelian randomization to the association of intermediate-
term exposure to Lp(a), estimated from observational stud-
ies in the Emerging Risk Factors Consortium,2 is very similar
totheratiooftheassociationoflifelongexposuretoLDL-Cwith
CHD risk estimated from mendelian randomization to the as-
sociation of intermediate-term exposure to LDL-C in the
Emerging Risk Factors Consortium (Figure 3; eFigure 9 in the

similar cumulative associations with the risk of CHD over time.

 Table2showstheexpectedclinicalbenefitinCHDriskfrom
both lifelong and short-term exposure to absolute differ-
ences in Lp(a) concentration. Lifelong estimates are conven-
tional mendelian randomization estimates, while short-term
estimates are calculated using the difference in Lp(a) concen-
tration needed to achieve the same change for a given reduc-
tion in LDL-C level over a median of 5 years of treatment with
a statin, as reported by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’
Collaboration.18
Independent Association of Lp(a)
and LDL-C–Lowering Therapies
To assess whether the association of lowering Lp(a) concen-
tration with the risk of CHD is likely to be independent of low-
ering LDL-C level with statins, we divided the population into
3 groups based on the number of LDL-C–lowering alleles each
participant inherited at a common variant (rs12916) in the
3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) gene,
which encodes the target of statins.26,27 The LPA score had
nearly identical associations per 10-mg/dL lower Lp(a) con-
centration in each of these 3 groups (CC genotype group: OR,
0.945; 95% CI, 0.927-0.964; CT genotype group: OR, 0.939;
95% CI, 0.927-0.952; TT genotype group: OR, 0.945; 95% CI,
0.932-0.957; P = .79 for difference) (eFigure 10 in the Supple-
ment), suggesting that the relative risk reduction of lowering
Lp(a) concentration is likely to be independent of lowering
LDL-C level with statins. Similar findings were observed for ge-
neticvariantsinthePCSK9andNPC1L1generegionsthatmimic
the changes associated with PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe,
respectively.
Discussion
We found that the association of genetically predicted plasma
Lp(a) with the risk of CHD was linearly proportional to the ab-
solute difference in Lp(a) concentration. Absolute differ-
ences in Lp(a) concentration of approximately 100 mg/dL had
an equivalent association with CHD risk as a 38.67-mg/dL dif-
ference in LDL-C level. The results of this study may have im-
portant implications for informing clinical practice guide-
lines on the use of Lp(a)-lowering therapies, for designing
randomized trials to evaluate Lp(a)-lowering therapies cur-
rently in development, and for designing screening programs
to reduce the global burden of CHD.
Becausea100-mg/dLdifferenceinLp(a)concentrationhad
the same association with CHD risk as a 38.67-mg/dL differ-
ence in LDL-C level, the results of this study suggest that phar-
macologically lowering Lp(a) concentration by approxi-
mately 100 mg/dL should reduce the risk of CHD (CHD death
or nonfatal myocardial infarction) by approximately 22% to
25% in a 3- to 5-year randomized trial, similar to the associa-

 tion that has been observed for a 38.67-mg/dL reduction in
LDL-C level during treatment with a statin.17-19 Therefore, it
follows that lowering Lp(a) concentration by 80 mg/dL might
be expected to reduce the risk of CHD events by approxi-
mately 18% to 20%, while lowering Lp(a) concentration by 50
mg/dL might reduce CHD events by 10% to 12% (Table 2), as-
suming that there are no unrecognized competing risks asso-
ciated with lowering Lp(a) concentration. Therefore, only per-
sons with very high Lp(a) concentrations are likely to benefit
substantially from therapies that reduce Lp(a) concentration.

 est to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events appreciably in
a short-term randomized trial.
The results of this study suggest that randomized trials
evaluating new, more potent Lp(a)-lowering therapies in de-
velopment should be designed to enroll individuals with very
high baseline Lp(a) concentrations of 90 to 100 mg/dL or more.
Reducing Lp(a) concentration by 80% to 90% in such indi-
viduals should translate into large absolute reductions in Lp(a)
concentrations of 70 to 90 mg/dL, which should in turn trans-
late into approximately a 15% to 20% proportional reduction
in the risk of CHD events. Enrolling patients at high risk of CHD
owing to markedly elevated Lp(a) concentration in the initial
proof-of-concept clinical trials is similar to the strategy used
by the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study trial,28 which
enrolled high-risk patients with markedly elevated LDL-C con-
centrations and was the first trial to demonstrate that treat-
ment with statins led to large, clinically meaningful reduc-
tions in the risk of cardiovascular events.
The magnitude of the pharmacologic reduction in Lp(a)
mass that is likely needed to produce clinically meaningful re-
ductions in CHD risk estimated in this study is larger than es-
timated in a 2018 study evaluating changes in Lp(a) during
treatmentwithniacin.29However,whereasthatpreviousstudy
involved informal estimates of the reversible CHD risk by low-
ering Lp(a) concentrations in a short-term trial,29 we used a
more systematic approach. In particular, our study estimated
the differences in genetically predicted Lp(a) and LDL-C con-
centrations needed to have the same change in lifetime CHD
risk and incorporated an assessment of the differential cumu-
lative associations of Lp(a) and LDL-C with CHD risk over time
to estimate how much Lp(a) concentration must be lowered
pharmacologically to produce the same change as lowering
LDL-C level by 38.67 mg/dL (ie, 1 mmol/L) with a statin. This
approach has been successfully used to accurately anticipate
the results of several recent trials.26,27,30 Similar analyses to
those used in the current study are needed before it would be
possible to accurately anticipate the potential effect of phar-
macologically lowering Lp(a) on the risk of stroke, peripheral
vascular disease, aortic stenosis, or composite end points that
include these outcomes.31
Finally, it should be noted that plasma Lp(a) concentration
islargelyheritable.Therefore,ifthelinearrelationshipwithCHD
riskcontinuesatveryhighabsoluteLp(a)concentrations(asoc-
curs for LDL-C), then Lp(a) concentrations in excess of 200
mg/dL may be associated with a 3- to 4-fold increased lifetime
riskofCHD(OR,3.30;95%CI,2.75-3.96)andthusmayrepresent
an inherited lipoprotein disorder that is associated with a simi-
larlifetimeriskofCHDasheterozygousfamilialhypercholester-
olemiabutwithaprevalencethatmaybe2-foldhigherthanthat
of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.32,33 Therefore,

trations and treating them with one of the new Lp(a)-lowering
therapiesindevelopmentcouldpotentiallyhavethesameeffect
on reducing the global burden of CHD as current screening pro-
gramsdesignedtodetectandtreatindividualswithfamilialhy-
percholesterolemia.
Limitations
Our study has limitations. Multiple different assays were used
to measure Lp(a) concentrations in the included studies. How-
ever, we focused only on absolute differences in Lp(a) associ-
ated with genetic variants, which were very similar across all
includedstudies,regardlessofassayusedorbaselineLp(a)con-
centrations. In addition, our estimate of the effect of lower-
ing Lp(a) is agnostic to the mechanism of action, and hence our
use of plasma Lp(a) mass concentration to estimate the dose-
response relationship does not imply that our estimates are
solely via changes in plasma Lp(a) mass concentration. If phar-
macologic Lp(a) lowering has associations not adequately cap-
tured by the genetic variants (eg, antithrombotic associa-
tions),thensmallerabsolutereductionsinLp(a)thanestimated
here may produce clinically meaningful reductions in CHD
risk.34
Conclusions
The association of genetically predicted Lp(a) with CHD risk
was linearly proportional to the absolute change in Lp(a) mass
concentration. Large absolute reductions in Lp(a) concentra-
tionofapproximately100mg/dLarelikelynecessarytoachieve
clinically meaningful reductions in the risk of CHD similar in
magnitude to what can be achieved by lowering LDL-C level
by 38.67 mg/dL (ie, 1 mmol/L) with a statin.

Mendelian Randomization Evidence for Cardiovascular
Precision Medicine
Christopher J. O’
Donnell, MD, MPH
An overarching aim of precision medicine is to direct the right
treatment to the right person at the right dose at the right time.
Recently, mendelian randomization (MR) studies have con-
tributed to our evidence base for precision medicine by har-
nessing genetic information
to assess whether associa-
tions of exposures with car-
diovascular outcomes may be causal. The ascendance of MR
studies takes advantage of the explosive growth of genome-
wide genetic data in multiple cohorts collaborating within
global meta-analyses. In MR studies, genetic variants associ-
ated with an exposure of interest serve as unconfounded prox-
ies for altered levels of the exposure.1
In this issue of JAMA Cardiology, Burgess et al2 confirm
well-established causal associations of both plasma lipopro-
tein(a) (Lp[a]) concentration and low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (LDL-C) level with coronary heart disease (CHD) and
further explore why randomized trials of Lp(a)-lowering treat-
ment do not show consistent evidence of net benefit. From ge-
netic data from more than 200 000 research participants, the
