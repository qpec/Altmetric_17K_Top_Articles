Jacobsen syndrome (JBS) is a rare congenital disorder caused by a terminal deletion of the
long arm of chromosome 11. A subset of patients exhibit social behavioural problems that
meet the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the underlying
molecular pathogenesis remains poorly understood. PX-RICS is located in the chromosomal
region commonly deleted in JBS patients with autistic-like behaviour. Here we report that
PX-RICS-deficient mice exhibit ASD-like social behaviours and ASD-related comorbidities.
PX-RICS-deficient neurons show reduced surface g-aminobutyric acid type A receptor
(GABAAR)
levels
and
impaired
GABAAR-mediated
synaptic
transmission.
PX-RICS,
GABARAP and 14-3-3z/y form an adaptor complex that interconnects GABAAR and
dynein/dynactin, thereby facilitating GABAAR surface expression. ASD-like behavioural
abnormalities in PX-RICS-deficient mice are ameliorated by enhancing inhibitory synaptic
transmission with a GABAAR agonist. Our findings demonstrate a critical role of PX-RICS in
cognition and suggest a causal link between PX-RICS deletion and ASD-like behaviour in JBS
patients.

 A
utism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a group of
aetiologically different neurodevelopmental conditions
characterized by a triad of behavioural deficits: impair-
ment in social interaction, difficulty with verbal and non-verbal
communication and repetitive behaviour or restricted interests1,2.
ASD is a highly heritable condition, with estimated heritability
indices of 80–90% (ref. 3). Several lines of evidence suggest that
an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition (E/I)
within specific cortical circuits is a shared cellular mechanism for
the behavioural and cognitive symptoms in several psychiatric
diseases, including ASD4–7. Several known ASD-causative genes
encode neuron-associated proteins that are essential for the
formation
and
maintenance
of
glutamatergic
excitatory
synapses8,9. Recent studies have also indicated that impaired
presynaptic release of g-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and the
resulting dysfunction of GABA-mediated inhibitory signalling,
has been associated with ASD5,10–12. These findings suggest that a
balance between glutamate and GABA signalling is essential for
normal cognitive function.
ASD-like behaviour is also known to appear as one of the
comorbid symptoms of several developmental syndromes such as
fragile-X syndrome2,13. Studying these syndromes will assist in
better understanding the pathogenesis of non-syndromic ASD.
Jacobsen syndrome (JBS; MIM 147791), also known as 11q
deletion syndrome or partial 11q monosomy syndrome, is a rare
congenital disorder caused by a deletion within the distal part of
the long arm of chromosome 11 (ref. 14). The incidence of JBS
has been estimated to be B1 of every 100,000 births14. JBS
patients commonly suffer from a variety of pre- and post-natal
developmental
anomalies
such
as
intellectual
disability,
characteristic
facial
dysmorphism,
heart
dysplasia
and
thrombocytopenia14. Prospective
genotype/phenotype
studies
have revealed several candidate genes that may be causative for
each symptom of JBS15–17. Recently, Akshoomoff et al.18 have
presented evidence that approximately half of JBS patients exhibit
behavioural problems that meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD,
and identified four annotated genes localized within a tiny
(0.24 Mb) interstitial deletion region on 11q24.3 as candidate
genes responsible for ASD-like behaviour in JBS. They have
concluded that PX-RICS is the most promising candidate gene
based on its predominant expression in the brain and its critical
roles in dendritic spine morphology and axon elongation18.
PX-RICS (ARHGAP32 isoform 1), a longer splicing isoform of
RICS (ARHGAP32 isoform 2), is a GTPase-activating protein
(GAP) for Cdc42, containing multiple domains for protein–
protein interactions19,20. RICS is expressed exclusively in the
brain in humans and regulates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor-mediated signalling at the postsynaptic density and
axonal elongation at the growth cone19,21. In contrast, PX-RICS is
expressed in relatively wide range of tissues but is predominantly
expressed in the brain20. PX-RICS has a unique phospholipid-
binding domain not shared by RICS: the Phox-homology (PX)
domain that mediates its interaction with phosphatidylinositol-4-
phosphate (PI4P)20. Recently, we have shown that PX-RICS
interacts with GABA type A receptor (GABAAR)-associated
protein (GABARAP) and 14-3-3z/y to facilitate trafficking of the
N-cadherin/b-catenin cell adhesion complex in non-neuronal
cells22,23.
In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms
underlying the autistic-like behaviour of PX-RICS-deficient mice.
Our results demonstrate an essential role for PX-RICS in normal
cognitive function and suggest that PX-RICS deficiency con-
tributes to the behavioural deficits in JBS patients.
Results
PX-RICS-deficient mice exhibit ASD-like social behaviour. JBS
is a haploinsufficiency disorder in which most cases carry a
de novo terminal deletion of one chromosome 11q (ref. 14). We
thus included PX-RICS þ / � mice in addition to PX-RICS þ / þ
and PX-RICS � / � mice in all behavioural assays. We first
examined voluntary social interaction using the three-chamber
test (Supplementary Fig. 1a)24. In the empty–empty (habituation)
session, no significant differences were observed between the time
spent exploring both wired cages (Fig. 1a,b) and between the time
stay in left and right chambers (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c) in all
genotypes. When a stranger mouse was placed in one wired cage
(stranger–empty session), every genotype had a similar preference
for the stranger-containing cage or chamber (Fig. 1a,b and
Supplementary Fig. 1b,c), suggesting that PX-RICS � / � mice
have normal voluntary sociability. In the subsequent familiar–
stranger session in which a novel stranger mouse was placed in
the previously empty wired cage, PX-RICS þ / þ mice spent more
time with the novel stranger mouse (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary
Fig. 1b,c). In contrast, PX-RICS � / � mice did not show such a
preference for social novelty and instead showed a tendency to
spend more time with a familiar stranger mouse (Fig. 1a,b
and Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). PX-RICS þ / � mice exhibited an
intermediate phenotype in the familiar–stranger session. No
significant differences in exploration and locomotor activity were
observed between genotypes in each session (Supplementary
Fig. 1d–f).
We next performed a reciprocal social interaction test in
which dyadic pairs of test (every genotype) and stimulator
(PX-RICS þ / þ) mice could freely move and mutually interact in
an open arena. We found that PX-RICS � / � mice spent less time
on social activities (Fig. 1c) such as nose-to-nose sniffing,
anogenital sniffing (Fig. 1d) and close huddling (Fig. 1e). In
addition, the rate of successful social interactions of PX-RICS � / �
test mice was significantly lower than that of PX-RICS þ / þ test
mice, regardless of whether the approach to the test mouse was
initiated by the stimulator or the test mouse itself (Fig. 1f).
Interestingly, PX-RICS � / � test mice frequently showed apathetic
or avoidance responses to approach from the stimulator, resulting
in an extremely poor success rate (34.5% in � / � versus 61.4%
Figure 1 | PX-RICS � / � mice exhibit behavioural features similar to the core triad of impairments in ASD. (a,b) Three-chamber social interaction test.
The time spent in close interaction with each wired cage in each session is shown (a). E, empty; FS, familiar stranger; NS, novel stranger; S; stranger.
Voluntary sociability and social preference are represented as a preference index, the ratio between time spent near the left and right wired cages in each
session (b; see Methods). The negative value in PX-RICS � / � mice in the familiar–stranger session (novel/familiar) shows their preference for a familiar
stranger mouse. (c–f) Dyadic social interaction test. PX-RICS � / � mice spent less time in social activities (c–e) and showed a markedly lower success rate
of social interaction in response to stimulator-initiated approach (f). (g) Social dominance tube test. PX-RICS � / � mice have a markedly lower winning rate.
(h) The number of USVs of PX-RICS þ / þ mice peaked on PND7 and decreased gradually, whereas that of PX-RICS � / � mice were significantly lower,
without a peak of calls. (i–k) PX-RICS � / � mice spent more time performing repetitive behaviours such as self-grooming (i) and digging (j,k). (l,m) Water

 tube test, a useful paradigm in predicting impairments in
social
interaction.
In
the
social
dominance
tube
test,
PX-RICS � / � rarely won against unfamiliar PX-RICS þ / þ or
PX-RICS þ / � mice (Fig. 1g), suggesting that PX-RICS � / � mice
are socially subordinate to PX-RICS þ / þ and PX-RICS þ / � mice,
and thus tend to avoid passive social contact with other
unfamiliar mice. The test mice displayed no aggressive behaviour;
they only pushed their opponent, tried to squeeze themselves
into the space between the opponent and the tube wall,
or remained still.
Social interaction of nocturnal rodents is primarily driven
by olfactory perception25. We thus examined responses to
olfactory cues using the olfactory habituation/dishabituation test.
We found that PX-RICS þ / þ and PX-RICS þ / � mice show
strong habituation/dishabituation responses to all olfactory
cues presented (Supplementary Fig. 1g). In contrast, whereas
PX-RICS � / �
mice showed normal responses to non-social
odours, they spent much less time interacting with unfamiliar
social odours than PX-RICS þ / þ and PX-RICS þ / � mice. This
result suggests that PX-RICS � / � mice have decreased interest in
unfamiliar
social
olfactory
cues,
although
their
olfactory
perception is not impaired.
Mouse
pups,
when
separated
from
their
mother,
emit
communicative ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during the first
2 or 3 postnatal weeks26. We thus measured maternal separation-
induced USVs to quantify social communication deficits. As
shown in Fig. 1h, USVs of PX-RICS þ / þ
pups reached a
maximum on postnatal day (PND) 7 and then decreased
gradually to almost zero by PND21. In contrast, PX-RICS � / �
pups emitted USVs much less frequently after PND7 and
required
more
time
to
emit
the
first
call
on
PND14
(Supplementary
Fig.
2a).
No
significant
differences
were
observed in the mean duration of calls, total calling time,
peak
frequency
and
peak
amplitude
between
genotypes
(Supplementary
Fig.
2b–e).
These
results
suggest
atypical
postnatal
development
of
mother–pup
communication
in
PX-RICS � / � pups.
Repetitive behaviour is the most noticeable symptom in ASD
individuals1,2. We monitored repetitive self-grooming behaviour
and found that PX-RICS � / � mice spend more than twice as
much time on repetitive self-grooming, persisting intermittently
for an unusually long (more than 2 min) period (Fig. 1i). The
marble-burying test also revealed that PX-RICS � / � mice have
more than twofold higher activity of repetitive digging behaviour
(Fig. 1j,k and Supplementary Fig. 2f). PX-RICS þ / �
mice
exhibited
intermediate
phenotypes
in
these
assays.
These
results clearly demonstrate increased repetitive behaviour in
PX-RICS � / � mice.
ASD
individuals
often
exhibit
inflexible
adherence
to
routines1,2. To assess the ability of mice to switch flexibly
from a previously established habit to a novel habit, we employed
acquisition and reversal learning tasks in a water T-maze27,28.
Learning performance was represented by the number of trials
in which mice made the correct arm choice, the number of
trials required to achieve five consecutive correct arm choices
and
the
latency
to
reach
an
escape
platform.
In
the
acquisition session, PX-RICS � / � mice showed good learning
performance comparable to PX-RICS þ / þ and PX-RICS þ / �
mice (Fig. 1l,m and Supplementary Fig. 2g). In the subsequent
reversal
learning
session,
however,
PX-RICS � / �
mice
persistently chose the correct arm of the previous acquisition
session, resulting in significantly worse learning performance
(Fig. 1l,m and Supplementary Fig. 2g). These results suggest that
PX-RICS � / � mice have a tendency to adhere a previously
established habit and less ability to adapt their behaviour to a
novel situation.
PX-RICS-deficient mice exhibit ASD-related comorbidities. In
ASD individuals, the triad of core behavioural problems is
commonly accompanied by neurodevelopmental comorbidities,
including impaired motor coordination and epilepsy2,13. We
investigated whether these ASD-related phenotypes are present in
PX-RICS � / � mice. The accelerating rotarod test revealed that
PX-RICS � / � mice can stay on a rotating rod for significantly less
time than PX-RICS þ / þ controls (Fig. 2a), indicating impaired
motor coordination. PX-RICS þ / � mice displayed intermediate
motor coordination between PX-RICS þ / þ and PX-RICS � / �
mice (Fig. 2a).
When suspended by the tail, several mouse models of
neuropsychiatric disorders display a limb-clasping phenotype, a
dystonic posture characterized by holding the fore- and/or
hindlimbs together29. This behaviour is a pathological reflex
that indicates lesions in the cerebellum, basal ganglia or
neocortex29. We observed severe limb-clasping behaviour in
68.2% of PX-RICS � / � mice (Fig. 2b), which is similar to a mouse
model of Rett syndrome, one of the constituent conditions
of ASD.
The prevalence of epilepsy is much higher in autistic children
(B30%) than non-autistic individuals (B1%), which suggests a
common molecular basis for cerebral hyperexcitability and
impaired cognitive function2,13. To assess the susceptibility to
epilepsy, we scored progressive seizures induced by kainic acid,
a
specific
agonist
for
the
kainate
subtype
of
ionotropic
glutamate receptors, with Racine’s scale30. PX-RICS � / � mice
were more sensitive to kainic acid than their PX-RICS þ / þ
littermates (Fig. 2c). Seizures in the PX-RICS � / � mice were
more severe (Fig. 2d) and progressed more rapidly to each seizure
stage (Fig. 2e).
Taken all behavioural data together, we concluded that
PX-RICS deficiency in mice leads to behavioural deficits reflecting
the core symptoms of ASD and its related comorbidities. We
propose that PX-RICS is the gene responsible for ASD-like
symptoms in JBS.
Impaired GABAAR surface expression in PX-RICS � / � mice.
Results
from
the
behavioural
tests
prompted
us
to
investigate
the
cellular
function
of
PX-RICS
underlying
ASD-like behaviour.
We have previously
shown that the
PX-RICS/GABARAP/14-3-3 complex facilitates dynein-/dynactin-
dependent trafficking of the N-cadherin/b-catenin complex in
non-neuronal cells22,23. GABARAP was originally identified as a
protein that binds to the g2 subunit of GABAAR and is known to
promote GABAAR trafficking to the neuronal surface31,32. We
thus hypothesized that the PX-RICS/GABARAP/14-3-3 complex
facilitates surface expression of GABAARs in neurons and that
impairment of this trafficking mechanism causes ASD-like
behaviour in PX-RICS-deficient mice.
We first tested the possibility that PX-RICS is involved in
GABAAR trafficking to the neuronal surface. We utilized g2EP, a
g2 subunit tagged at its N-terminal extracellular domain with
ecliptic pHluorin33,34, a pH-sensitive variant of green fluorescent
protein that is non-fluorescent in acidic environments (pHo6)35.
Thus, g2EP-containing GABAARs are non-fluorescent during
trafficking but become readily visualized when expressed on the
neuronal surface. When g2EP was expressed in PX-RICS þ / þ
cortical neurons and observed in pH 7.4 buffer, robust dot-like
fluorescent signals could be detected (Fig. 3a). This fluorescence
was almost entirely derived from surface-expressed g2EP because
transient exposure to a pH 6.0 buffer quenched the fluorescent
signals. Total g2EP fluorescence was revealed by subsequent
exposure
to
an
NH4Cl-containing
pH
7.4
buffer,
which
equilibrates
the
intracellular
pH
to
7.4.

cortical
neurons,
surface
fluorescence
was
markedly reduced, but total fluorescence in pH 7.4 NH4Cl-
containing buffer was similar to that in PX-RICS þ / þ neurons
(Fig. 3a). Quantification of the fluorescence intensities revealed
that the amount of surface-expressed g2EP is markedly decreased
in PX-RICS � / � neurons (Fig. 3b). This result was confirmed
by the cell surface labelling and surface biotinylation assays
(Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). Internalization activity for g2 was
similar between the PX-RICS þ / þ and PX-RICS � / � cortical
neurons, suggesting that the reduction in surface g2EP in
PX-RICS � / � neurons is due to impaired trafficking to the
plasma membrane, not to enhanced endocytic withdrawal of
surface g2EP (Supplementary Fig. 3e–h). The cell surface labelling
and surface biotinylation assays revealed that surface-expressed
g2 is markedly reduced in PX-RICS � / � hippocampal neurons
and
cerebellar
granule
neurons
(CGNs)
(Supplementary
Fig.
3a,c,d).
Taken
together,
we
concluded
that
surface
expression of GABAARs is impaired in PX-RICS � / � neurons.

vesicles in the presynaptic terminal, in hippocampal CA1
pyramidal cells using the whole-cell patch–clamp recording
technique (Fig. 3c) (ref. 39). Quantitative analysis of mIPSCs
revealed no significant difference (P ¼ 0.89) in the mIPSC
frequency (evaluated by the interval between mIPSCs) between
PX-RICS þ / þ (99.4±19.4 ms) and PX-RICS � / � (95.4±21.4 ms)
neurons (Fig. 3d), suggesting that presynaptic neurotransmitter
release is similar between PX-RICS þ / þ
and PX-RICS � / �
neurons. In contrast, the mIPSC amplitude of PX-RICS � / �
neurons (26.8±1.2 pA) was significantly smaller (P ¼ 0.0075)
than that of PX-RICS þ / þ neurons (32.5±1.6 pA; Fig. 3e). These
electrophysiological data indicate that postsynaptic responsive-
ness to inhibitory inputs is attenuated in PX-RICS � / � mice,
which is in line with the reduced surface expression of GABAARs.
PX-RICS forms a trafficking complex for GABAARs. We next
analysed
whether
GABARAP,
14-3-3
and
dynein/dynactin
participate in PX-RICS-mediated GABAAR transport. We found
that the g2 subunit, GABARAP and PX-RICS form a ternary
complex in cortical neurons (Fig. 4a) and are colocalized in the
perinuclear region of the soma (Fig. 4b–d). Immunofluorescent
staining
with
organelle-specific
markers
revealed
that this
region corresponds to the endoplasmic reticulum, endoplasmic
reticulum exit sites and endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi inter-
mediate compartments (Supplementary Fig. 4b–l). They were also
colocalized in dendritic compartments (Fig. 4b–d) that were
immunopositive
for
endoplasmic
reticulum-,
endoplasmic
reticulum exit site-, endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate
compartment-
and
trans-Golgi
network-specific
markers
(Supplementary
Fig.
4b–l),
suggesting
that
PX-RICS
and
GABARAP are localized in the dendritic satellite secretory
outposts40,41. The colocalization results were confirmed by
quantitative
analysis
of
the
immunofluorescent
signals42
(Supplementary Figs 5 and 6). This localization is consistent
with their involvement in local delivery of GABAARs to the
dendritic surface. Further ultracentrifugation analysis revealed
that 14-3-3z/y and dynactin1, as well as g2 and GABARAP,
coimmunoprecipitated with PX-RICS in high-molecular-weight
(4440 kDa) fractions (Fig. 4e,f). We confirmed that 14-3-3z/y
and dynactin1 are colocalized with g2, PX-RICS and GABARAP
in the soma and dendrites of cortical neurons (Fig. 4g–i and
Supplementary Figs 5 and 6). The introduction of siRNA against
any one of them into cortical neurons resulted in a drastic

a microtubule-dependent molecular motor, was used as a negative control for immunoprecipitation: it is present in fractions 6–8 (e), but does not
coimmunoprecipitate with PX-RICS in the pooled lysate (f). KIF5 is known to interact with GABARAP to facilitate plus-end-directed retrograde transport of
GABAARs (ref. 65). (g–i) g2, GABARAP and PX-RICS were colocalized with 14-3-3z (g), 14-3-3y (h) and dynactin1 (i) in the perinuclear region of the soma

 reduction in surface g2 levels and a simultaneous increase in
intracellular g2 levels (Fig. 5a,b).
We further determined whether the PX-RICS/GABARAP/
14-3-3 complex is required for surface expression of GABAARs.
When
wild-type
PX-RICS
was
exogenously
expressed
in
PX-RICS � / � neurons, surface expression of the g2 subunit was
drastically increased (Fig. 5c–g). In contrast, PX-RICS-DRSKSDP
and PX-RICS-S1796A, two mutants lacking the binding ability to
14-3-3 (ref. 23), had no apparent effect on surface expression of
g2 (Fig. 5c–g). Similarly, surface g2 levels remained unchanged in
PX-RICS � / � neurons expressing PX-RICS-DGBR, a mutant
defective in GABARAP binding23 (Fig. 5c–g).
Taken together, these results suggest that g2, GABARAP, PX-
RICS, 14-3-3z/y and dynactin1 are assembled into a large cargo-
adaptor-motor complex that plays a facilitating role in GABAAR
surface expression. On the basis of a similarity to the trafficking
mechanism previously proposed for the N-cadherin/b-catenin
complex22,23, we speculate a possible model for trafficking
g2-containing GABAARs (Fig. 6).
A curative effect of clonazepam on autistic-like behaviour. Cell
surface labelling revealed that a small amount of the g2 subunit
remains on the surface of PX-RICS � / � neurons (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). We speculate that this observation may be due to an
auxiliary secretory route for g2-containing GABAARs that
complements or bypasses the PX-RICS-dependent pathway.
We reasoned that ASD-like behaviour in PX-RICS � / � mice may
be treatable by potentiating synaptic inhibition through the
GABAARs remaining on the neuronal surface. Before testing
this idea, we first determined an optimum injected dose of
clonazepam (CZP), a benzodiazepine agonist for GABAAR, to
avoid its sedative and anxiolytic effects that could potentially
affect our behavioural experiments. Open-field and elevated
plus-maze tests revealed that intraperitoneal administration of
CZP in a dose up to 0.03 mg kg � 1 causes no significant sedative
or anxiolytic effects in both PX-RICS þ / þ and PX-RICS � / �
mice (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d).
We
then
conducted
behavioural
tests
of
CZP-treated
PX-RICS � / � mice. In the three-chamber social interaction test,
we found that vehicle-treated PX-RICS � / � mice show impaired
preference for social novelty, whereas preference for social
novelty in CZP-treated PX-RICS � / � mice is almost completely
normalized (Fig. 7a–d). No significant differences were observed
in
exploration
and
locomotor
activity
in
each
session
(Supplementary Fig. 7e–g). Similarly, the water T-maze test
revealed that learning performance of CZP-treated PX-RICS � / �
mice in the reversal learning session is remarkably improved
compared with vehicle-treated PX-RICS � / � mice (Fig. 7e,f and
Supplementary
Fig.
7h),
indicating
that
persistence
to
a
previously established habit is significantly alleviated by CZP
administration.
In
each
test,
intraperitoneal
injection
of
0.03 mg kg � 1 CZP had no effect on the social behaviour of
PX-RICS þ / þ mice. These results demonstrate that ASD-like
behaviour
in
PX-RICS � / �
mice
is
caused
by
impaired
postsynaptic GABA signalling and that GABAAR agonists have
the potential to treat ASD-like behaviour in JBS patients and
possibly non-syndromic ASD individuals.
Discussion
JBS is a contiguous gene disorder caused by large terminal
deletion of chromosome 11q (ref. 14). Simultaneous loss of
multiple genes results in a wide variety of congenital defects,
including intellectual disability14. Recently, Akshoomoff et al.18
have conducted cognitive and behavioural assessments of JBS
patients using standardized diagnostic procedures and shown that
more than half of JBS patients meet the criteria for ASD
diagnosis. Furthermore, they defined the 0.24-Mb autism critical
region in distal 11q and identified four annotated genes: KCNJ1,
KCNJ5, TP53AIP1 and RICS/PX-RICS (Supplementary Fig. 8)
(ref. 18). KCNJ1 encodes the renal outer medullary potassium

Figure 6 | A possible model for a PX-RICS-dependent cargo-motor interconnection. (a) The multiple domains mediating protein–protein and
protein–phospholipid interactions of PX-RICS enables PX-RICS to play a central role as a scaffold in assembling the constituents of the trafficking complex.
Cargo recognition is conducted by GABARAP through its binding to the cytoplasmic region of the g2 subunit31. GABARAP also serves as a binding cue for
PX-RICS. Crystal structure analysis has revealed that GABARAP can self-associate in a head-to-tail manner66, and this oligomerization activity may underlie
its multitasking ability. Phosphorylation of PX-RICS by CaMKII induces the sequential assembly of 14-3-3z/y and dynein/dynactin23. By interconnecting the
transport-competent g2-containing GABAAR complex with the dynein/dynactin motor complex, the PX-RICS/GABARAP/14-3-3 adaptor complex
facilitates GABAAR transport from the somatodendritic secretory compartments to the neuronal surface. (b) A previously proposed trafficking model for
the N-cadherin/b-catenin (b-cat) complex22,23. Cargo recognition is accomplished by PX-RICS through its binding ability to b-catenin. GABARAP provide a
binding cue to PX-RICS to anchor it on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. See also our previous papers for further details22,23. Recently, it has become
apparent that an increasing number of plasma membrane-bound receptors depend on GABARAP for their cell surface expression22,23,32,67–70.
Thus, the PX-RICS-dependent adaptor system may be implicated in the delivery of a wide variety of cell surface proteins.

 thymus45. The encoded protein is localized in the mitochondrion
and mediates p53-dependent apoptosis46. Given their reported
localizations and functions, it is unlikely that KCNJ1, KCNJ5 and
TP53AIP1 are involved in cognitive function and cause the
ASD-like behaviour observed in JBS. In contrast, PX-RICS is the
only candidate that is expressed predominantly in the brain and
known to play functional roles in neurons20. The present study
has shown that loss-of-function of PX-RICS in mice results
in various ASD-like behaviour associated with deficits in
PX-RICS-dependent GABAAR surface expression (Supplementary
Fig. 8). Our findings strongly support the notion that PX-RICS is
the gene responsible for ASD-like symptoms in JBS patients and
also provide evidence that a gene encoding a trafficking factor
is implicated in ASD-like behaviour (Supplementary Fig. 8).
We therefore propose that JBS-related ASD (and possibly a subset
of ASD) is a trafficking disease.
Our
findings
also
demonstrate
that
PX-RICS-mediated
GABAAR trafficking is one of the biological systems that support
normal
cognitive
function.
Recently,
dysfunctional
GABA
signalling has been increasingly reported to be associated with
ASD5. GABA-releasing neuron-specific deletion of the gene for
methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2), a chromatin-associated
transcription factor, in mice leads to a variety of Rett syndrome-
like behavioural features10. Mice lacking the contactin-associated
protein-like
2
gene
(Cntnap2)
encoding
a
neuronal
transmembrane protein of the neurexin superfamily display a
reduced number of GABA-releasing interneurons and ASD-
related phenotypes11. Forebrain interneuron-specific deletion of
the Scn1a gene, which encodes the a subunit of the sodium
channel neuronal type I, in mice results in decreased firing
activity
of
GABA-releasing
interneurons
and
ASD-related
behaviour12. These findings demonstrate that dysfunction of the
presynaptic mechanisms for releasing GABA contributes to
ASD-like behaviour. In contrast, the present study has shown
that dysfunction of the postsynaptic mechanism for trafficking
GABAARs in GABA-receiving neurons is also associated with
ASD-like behaviour. Collectively, GABA signalling is essential for
normal cognitive function and seriously affects social behaviour if
impaired in either GABA-releasing or GABA-receiving neurons.
Another important finding is that the ASD-like behavioural
phenotypes of PX-RICS-deficient mice can be successfully rescued
by treatment with a low dose of CZP, which suggests that
compensatory potentiation of postsynaptic GABAergic signalling
could be an effective therapeutic strategy for controlling ASD-like
behavioural problems12,47. Despite the increasing number of
children diagnosed with ASD and the high prevalence of ASD of
B1% of the population, currently available pharmacological
therapies remain supportive8. A recent whole-exome-sequencing
study has identified a rare missense single-nucleotide variation in
the PX-RICS gene in a non-syndromic ASD patient, suggesting
that PX-RICS deficiency can be a pathogenic factor for this type
of ASD as well48. We believe that our PX-RICS-deficient mice can
be a unique disease model that properly recapitulates the
pathogenic process of ASD-like behaviour in JBS patients and a
valuable tool for the discovery of permanent cure drugs, as well as
for a better understanding of non-syndromic ASD and related
neurodevelopmental disorders.
Our previous reports revealed that PX-RICS is a GAP that
selectively targets Cdc42 and that PX-RICS deficiency leads to an
increase in neuronal Cdc42 activity19–21. We also found that the
Cdc42GAP activity is required for PX-RICS-mediated transport
of the N-cadherin/b-catenin complex22. How is Cdc42 activity
connected
with
PX-RICS-mediated
GABAAR
trafficking?
In this context, it is notable that collybistin, a brain-specific
GDP/GTP
exchange
factor
for
Cdc42,
is
present
in
the
scaffold protein complex for synaptic GABAARs and regulates
gephyrin-dependent
GABAAR
anchoring
and
clustering49.
Collybistin
binds
to
phosphatidylinositols
(PIs),
with
a
preference for PI3P and PI4P, through its pleckstrin homology
domain50, as PX-RICS does20. Thus, the balance between the
activities of the Cdc42 GDP/GTP exchange factor and GAP
(that is, collybistin and PX-RICS) might control the synaptic
expression and localization of GABAARs.
In summary, we have found that surface expression of
GABAARs is impaired in PX-RICS � / � neurons. More impor-
tantly, stimulation of GABA signalling with a GABAAR agonist
improved some autistic-like phenotypes of PX-RICS � / � mice.
Consequently, we conclude that dysfunctional PX-RICS-mediated
GABAAR trafficking in postsynaptic neurons is a plausible cause
for the observed behavioural and molecular deficits. It is possible
that alternative binding partners of PX-RICS are also relevant for
GABAAR-mediated signalling; PX-RICS is known to interact with
more than 60 proteins other than GABARAP and 14-3-3 s, many
of which have potential roles in important neuronal processes
such as neurite extension, regulation of Rho GTPases pathway
and transcriptional regulation. Cleary, further investigation is
needed to test the involvement of other putative PX-RICS
interactors in GABA signalling, as well as other proteins
implicated in complementary or compensatory pathways.
Methods
Mice. All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the University
of Tokyo Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and were conducted
according to the University of Tokyo Guidelines for Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals. Mice were housed in clean plastic cages (CLEA Japan) lined with paper
bedding (Japan SLC) at a constant temperature of 23 �C in a 12-h light/dark cycle
(lights off at 21:00), with food and water available ad libitum. PX-RICS-deficient
mice were generated as described elsewhere21. Mutant mice were backcrossed to
C57BL/6N (CLEA Japan) background to the F10 generation. The mice used in
behavioural and electrophysiological studies were generated by breedings of
heterozygous mutant males and females in the C57BL/6N background. Young
adult male mice (8–10 weeks old) were used in all behavioural tests except for
USV analysis and the foot-clasping test, in which both male and female pups of
PND5–21 and PND21 were used, respectively. Unless otherwise noted, all tests
were conducted with a naive cohort. Six- to eight-week-old male mice were used
for electrophysiological analysis. The embryos and newborns for primary neuronal
cultures were generated by crossing wild-type C57BL/6N males and females, or
homozygous mutant males and females in the C57BL/6N background. Embryonic
day (E) 16–18 embryos were used for primary culture of cortical and hippocampal
neurons, and PND7 pups for CGNs.
Behavioural tests. Behavioural assays of mice were designed and performed in
accordance with the standard procedures described previously51–54. Detailed
procedures are described in the following sections. Full statistical data for the
behavioural tests are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
Three-chamber social interaction test. Mice were tested for voluntary social
interaction as previously described24. The three-chamber apparatus (O’HARA &
CO., LTD.) was a non-transparent acrylic open arena (61 � 40 � 22 cm) with a
removal floor placed in a soundproof chamber (74 � 50 � 83 cm). The arena
was divided into left, middle and right chambers (20 � 40 � 22 cm) by two
semi-transparent partitions with a small rectangular opening (5 � 3 cm) in the
bottom centre, through which a test mouse could travel between the three
chambers. A quarter cylindrical wired cage (10 cm in radius and 10.5 cm in height)
was placed at each back corner of the left and right chambers. A quarter cylindrical
weight (10 cm in radius and 10.5 cm in height) was placed on the top of each wired
cage to prevent the test mouse from climbing the wired cage and the stranger
mouse from escaping. Illumination on the arena floor was kept at 100 lx during
the tests.
Male test mice 8–10 weeks old were habituated to the testing room for at least
1 h before beginning the test. For 3 days before testing, age-matched wild-type
males unfamiliar to the test mice (stranger mice) were left inside the wired cages for
20 min per day for habituation. A test mouse was first placed in the centre of the
middle chamber and left to habituate for 10 min in the absence of stranger mice in
the wired cages (empty–empty session). Subsequently, a stranger mouse was
introduced into one of the two wired cages. Then, the test mouse was placed in the
centre of the middle chamber and allowed to freely explore all three chambers for
10 min (stranger–empty session). Finally, after a novel stranger mouse was placed
in another wired cage that had served as the empty cage in the previous sessions,
the test mouse was again allowed to freely explore for 10 min (familiar–stranger

 session). Movement of the test mouse was recorded by a charge-coupled device
camera and analysed online with Time CSI video tracking software (O’HARA &
CO., LTD). The open arena, partitions, wired cages and weights were cleaned with
70% ethanol and wiped with paper towels before the next trial. Time spent in close
interaction near each wired cage and time spent in each chamber were converted
into a preference index, which was calculated as 100 � (time with a right empty
cage)/(time with a right empty cage þ time with a left empty cage) � 50 (in the
empty–empty session), as 100 � (time with a stranger mouse)/(time with a stranger
mouse þ time with an empty cage) � 50 (in the stranger–empty session) or as
100 � (time with a novel stranger mouse)/(time with a novel stranger
mouse þ time with a familiar stranger mouse) � 50 (in the familiar–stranger
session).
Dyadic social interaction test. Mice were tested for reciprocal social interaction
as previously described55. Male test mice 8–10 weeks old were habituated to the
testing room for at least 1 h before beginning the test. Wild-type males unfamiliar
with the test mice were used as stimulators, and their tail tips were painted black
with a marker for identification before habituation. An age-matched pair of test
and stimulator mice was placed in a non-transparent acrylic open arena
(50 � 50 � 40 cm) lined with fresh paper bedding, and their behaviour was
video-recorded for 10 min. The number and duration of the following social
behaviour were measured by visual observation of the movie: sniffing
(nose-to-nose, anogenital and to other areas (neck, flank, tail and so on)),
social pursuit (following within one body length as the stimulator mouse moved
continuously throughout the cage), social proximity (close huddling within one
body length of each other without movement) and total social activities, as well as
the latency to the first social contact. We did not observe other social behaviour,
such as allo-grooming and social mounting, in our 10-min tests. In addition,
we quantified the responses of the test mice (successful interaction or no
interaction (no interest or escape)) when approach to the test mouse was initiated
by stimulator or test mouse itself. The open arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol
and wiped with paper towels before the next test.
Social dominance tube test. The tube test for social dominance and social
hierarchy was performed as described previously56,57. The apparatus was a
transparent plexiglass tube 30 cm in length and 3.5 cm in diameter. Two
age-matched (8–10 weeks old) male mice of different genotypes unfamiliar to each
other were placed at opposite ends of the tube and simultaneously released in a
forward direction towards each other. Almost all mice entered the tube obediently
without any particular training. A mouse was judged as a loser when it backed
away and put its four paws outside the tube earlier than its opponent within 2 min.
A mouse was judged as a winner when it remained inside the tube after the
opponent backed out of the tube. To avoid bias, the same pair of mice was
subjected to a second match with no interval, switching the releasing side.
All matches ended within 2 min in our test. The tube was cleaned with 70% ethanol
and wiped with paper towels between matches.
Olfactory habituation/dishabituation test. The ability of mice to discriminate
odorant stimuli was tested as described previously12,28. We employed water as a
control, almond and banana extracts as unfamiliar non-social odours, male mouse
urine as a social odour and food pellets as a familiar non-social odour. The almond
(KYORITSU FOODS) and banana (NARIZUKA Corporation) extracts were
diluted (1:100) with water. The mouse urine was obtained separately from two
age-matched wild-type males unfamiliar to the test mice. Food pellet odorant was
prepared by soaking a ground food pellet in water. Cotton swabs saturated with
these odorants (50 ml) were presented to mice using a test tube clamp so that the
tips of the swabs were fixed 2 cm above the centre of the cage lids to prevent the test
mice from touching the swabs with their forepaws. Before beginning the test, a
male test mouse 8–10 weeks old was habituated to a cotton swab for 30 min in its
home cage. Then, the odours were sequentially presented in three consecutive trials
per odorant stimulus (2 min per trial) in the following order: water, almond extract,
banana extract, mouse urine 1, mouse urine 2 and food pellet. In each trial,
the time spent sniffing towards the swab was measured by an observer with a
stopwatch.
Ultrasonic vocalizations. Maternal separation-induced USVs were monitored as
described previously58. All procedures were performed in a soundproof chamber
(O’HARA & CO., LTD.). Both male and female pups were individually removed
from their mother at PND5, 7, 10, 14 and 21, and gently placed inside a stainless
steel open cylinder (7.5 cm in diameter and 7 cm in height) on a cooling plate set at
24 �C. Recording was started after a 1-min delay because we commonly observed
that immediately after being placed inside the cylinder, pups emitted unusually
frequent and strong USVs, regardless of their genotype, sex and PND. After a
5-min recording period, pups were promptly returned to their mother. We utilized
the UltraSoundGate system (Avisoft Bioacoustics) for recording and SASLab Pro
software (Avisoft Bioacoustics) for quantitative analysis. The cylinder was cleaned
with 70% ethanol and wiped with paper towels between recordings.
Repetitive behaviour. Self-grooming behaviour was examined as described
previously59. A male mouse 8–10 weeks old was placed in a clean empty cage,
left for habituation for 10 min and consecutively video-recorded for 10 min.
Cumulative time spent in full-body grooming was measured with a stopwatch.
Digging behaviour was evaluated using the marble-burying test as described
previously60. Twenty black glass marbles (15 mm diameter) were gently placed
evenly spaced apart in a 4 � 5 arrangement on 5-cm-thick fresh paper bedding in a
clean cage (27.5 � 17 � 13 cm). After taking a still image of marbles from straight
above the cage, a male mouse 8–10 weeks old was gently placed in the centre of the
cage and left for free exploration for 30 min. Then, the mouse was removed and a
still image of the marbles was taken again from straight above the cage. Digging
behaviour was quantitatively evaluated by analysing pre- and post-test images with
ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Strong colour contrast between the
black marbles and the white bedding enabled us to easily define the marble area.
The marble was judged as ‘buried’ if more than 50% of the marble area was covered
by the paper bedding. The number and area of marbles buried were evaluated.
Water T-maze test. Perseverative behaviour was assessed using the water T-maze
as previously described27,28. The apparatus was a T-shaped transparent acrylic
open tank 30 cm deep with a long main arm (96 cm in length and 17.5 cm in width)
and two perpendicular side arms (36 cm in length and 17.5 cm in width). A white
escape platform (6 � 6 cm, 21.5 cm in height) was designed to fit snugly to the end
of the side arms to prevent it from wobbling. The apparatus was filled with tap
water at 23±1 �C to a depth of 22.5 cm so that the top of the escape platform was
positioned 1 cm below the water surface. The water was coloured white with poster
paint (Nicker Colours) to make the submerged escape platform invisible.
In a habituation swim trial on day 1, a male mouse 8–10 weeks old was placed
on the water surface at the starting end of the main arm facing towards the side
arms and then gently released. After 60 s of free swimming without the escape
platform, the mouse was gently wiped with a towel, placed in an empty cage on a
warming plate (38 �C setting) for 5 min, and then returned to its home cage. On the
following 3 days (day 2–4), acquisition swim trials were performed in which the
escape platform was submerged at the end of the right arm of the T-maze. Fifteen
consecutive swim trials were performed every 3 days. In each trial, the latency to
reach the escape platform and the result of arm choice were recorded. The mouse
was removed from the platform after a 20-s stay when it reached the escape
platform within 35 s. The mouse was guided onto the escape platform and left for
20 s when it could not find the platform within 35 s. In the last 3 days (day 5–7),
reversal learning trials were performed as described above, except that the escape
platform was placed at the end of the left arm.
Accelerating rotarod test. Motor coordination was assessed using an accelerating
rotarod apparatus (O’HARA & CO., LTD.) as described previously28. A male
mouse 8–10 weeks old was placed on a rotating shaft of the apparatus when the
rotation speed reached 4 r.p.m., and then, the rotation speed was increased to
40 r.p.m. over 5 min. Latency to fall off the rod was measured. Mice were tested for
one trial per day for 5 consecutive days. The shaft was cleaned with 70% ethanol
and wiped with paper towels between trials.
Foot-clasping test. To test foot clasping, both male and female mice on PND21
were suspended by the tail for 30 s.
Seizure susceptibility test. Kainic acid (SIGMA) was dissolved in physiological
saline and administered intraperitoneally to 20 pairs of PX-RICS þ / þ and
PX-RICS � / � littermates (8- to 9-week-old males; 20.4–26.7 g body weight) at a
dose of 30 mg per kg body weight in a total volume of 0.20–0.25 ml. The final dose
of kainic acid was determined based on the results of pilot experiments. The mice
were monitored and video-recorded in a clear cage for 2 h. The video recordings
were used to confirm the visual scoring of seizures. Seizure severity was scored
according to a modified Racine’s scale30: 0, no response; 1, behavioural arrest with
mouth and facial twitches; 2, head nodding; 3, forelimb clonus; 4, seizures
characterized by rearing; 5, seizures characterized by rearing and falling; and 6,
death from continuous convulsions.
CZP treatment. CZP (Wako) was suspended in vehicle solution (0.5% (w/v)
methylcellulose 400 (Wako)/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) and diluted
with the vehicle solution for injection in a volume of 10 ml kg � 1 at a dose
of 0.03–0.5 mg kg � 1. The diluted CZP suspension or vehicle solution was
intraperitoneally administered to a male test mouse 8–10 weeks old 30 min
before behavioural testing.
The sedative effect of CZP was evaluated as described previously12. The
apparatus for the open-field locomotor activity test was a non-transparent acrylic
open arena (O’HARA & CO., LTD) without bedding. The CZP-injected mouse was
placed in the centre of the arena, and its movement was monitored by a charge-
coupled device camera for 10 min. Total distance moved and total immobile time
were analysed online with the Time CSI software (O’HARA & CO., LTD). The
arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol and wiped with paper towels between trials.

 The anxiolytic effect of CZP was evaluated using an elevated plus-maze as
described previously12. The apparatus (O’HARA & CO., LTD) was a plus-shaped
maze fixed at 50 cm in height above the floor comprising two open and two closed
arms (25 cm in length and 5 cm in width). The former had small ledges along their
edges to prevent a test mouse from losing its footing, whereas the latter were
enclosed by semi-transparent acrylic walls (15 cm in height) on three sides. The
CZP-injected mouse was placed in the centre of the maze facing towards one of the
closed arms and then gently released into the closed arm. Movement of the mice
was video-recorded for 10 min. Time spent in the open and the closed arms, and
the number of entries into each arm were measured by visual observation of the
movies with a stopwatch. The floors and walls of the maze were cleaned with 70%
ethanol and wiped with paper towels between trials.
The three-chamber social interaction test and the water T-maze test of the
CZP- or vehicle-injected mice were performed as described above.
Reagents. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) to PX-RICS and GABARAP were
generated as described previously20,22. Briefly, anti-PX-RICS and anti-GABARAP
pAbs were generated by immunizing rabbits with recombinant human PX-RICS
(amino acids 53–112) and human GABARAP (full length) fused to glutathione
S-transferase, respectively. The antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography
using columns to which the antigens used for immunization had been linked.
Cell culture and transfection. Cortical and hippocampal neurons were isolated
from E16–18 mouse embryos and plated into 6- or 12-well tissue culture plates or
35-mm glass-bottom dishes precoated with 1 mg ml � 1 poly-L-lysine (SIGMA) as
described previously19,21. Cells were cultured in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen)
supplemented with B-27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mM L-glutamine
(Invitrogen). A unit of 10 mM cytosine b-D-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C; SIGMA) was
added to the medium for the first 3 days. Half of the medium was changed every
3 days. CGNs were isolated from PND7 pups in the same way except that
Neurobasal-A medium (Invitrogen) containing 25 mM KCl was used. Transfection
of primary cultured cortical neurons was performed at 14 days in vitro (DIV) using
FuGENE 6 (Roche) for plasmid constructs and at 10 DIV using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for siRNAs. Three hours after transfection, the media were
replaced with conditioned media.
Fluorescent imaging of pHluorin-tagged c2 in live neurons. pHluorin is a
pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein variant that exhibits minimal fluorescence at
acidic pH (pHo6.5) and a robust fluorescent signal at neutral pH35. The tagged
receptors are thus non-fluorescent during trafficking when the N terminus of the
g2 subunit resides in the acidic lumen of transport vesicles but become readily
visualized when exposed to the extracellular neutral pH environment at the cell
surface33,34. A mammalian expression construct for the g2L isoform tagged with
ecliptic pHluorin (g2EP) was a kind gift from Dr Moss (Tufts University). Unlike
the g2S isoform, surface expression of g2L requires the a and b subunits61; thus,
this method monitors surface expression only of the correctly assembled receptor
complex. pcDNA3.1-a1 and pcDNA3.1-b2 were kind gifts from Dr Kang
(Vanderbilt University). The GABAAR with the subunit combination a1b2g2 is the
most abundant receptor subtype (B60% of GABAARs)62. Mouse cortical neurons
(14 DIV) cultured in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes were transfected with g2EP
(0.5 mg) together with pcDNA3.1-a1 (0.5 mg) and pcDNA3.1-b2 (0.5 mg) using
FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Three hours after
transfection, the media were replaced with conditioned media. Forty-eight hours
after transfection, fluorescent and differential interference contrast images were
obtained with an LSM510META laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). Just
before image acquisition, culture media were replaced with imaging media in the
following order. IM-7.4 (standard buffer): 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 125 mM NaCl,
5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM D-glucose; IM-6.0 (low-pH
buffer): the same composition as IM-7.4 except that 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) was
replaced with 10 mM MES (pH 6.0); and IM-7.4N (NH4Cl buffer): the same
composition as IM-7.4 except that 50 mM NH4Cl was added and the concentration
of NaCl was reduced to 75 mM; IM-6.0N (low pH, NH4Cl buffer): the same
composition as IM-7.4N except that 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) was replaced with
10 mM MES (pH 6.0). The settings of the microscope, lasers and detectors were
kept unchanged during image acquisition.
Surface labelling. Surface labelling was performed as described63. The rabbit pAb
to g2 (Synaptic Systems) used for surface labelling recognizes the N-terminal
extracellular region of the subunit. Primary and secondary antibodies used for
surface labelling before fixation were diluted in conditioned medium from 14 DIV
cortical or hippocampal neurons or from 10 DIV CGNs. The cell images were
obtained with an LSM510META laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). The
settings of the microscope, lasers and detectors were kept constant during image
acquisition.

RT to block the unlabelled anti-g2 antibody on the surface. The neurons were then
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and stained with the
indicated combinations of the primary antibodies for 60 min at RT and then with
Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 594- and Alexa Fluor 647-labelled secondary

remaining on the neuronal surface, rinsed in PBS and then permeabilized with

pAb to g2 and mouse mAb to FLAG (M2; 1:500; SIGMA), and then with Alexa
Fluor 647-labelled anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 594-labelled anti-mouse IgG.
Surface biotinylation assay. Biotinylation of neuronal surface proteins was
performed as described previously23. PX-RICS þ / þ and PX-RICS � / � cortical or
hippocampal neurons (14 DIV) or CGNs (10 DIV) were washed three times with
ice-cold PBS and incubated with 0.25 mg ml � 1 EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin
(Thermo Scientific) in PBS for 20 min at 4 �C with gentle agitation. After an
immediate rinse with ice-cold quenching buffer (50 mM glycine in PBS), the
neurons were further washed three times in ice-cold quenching buffer for 5 min
each. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer T (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 140 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail) and cleared lysates (0.5 mg of protein) were incubated with 60 ml
of 50% slurry of streptavidin–agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) for 2 h at 4 �C.
Beads were washed five times in lysis buffer T and then once with PBS. Bound
proteins were analysed by immunoblotting with rabbit pAb to g2 (1:1,000; Synaptic
Systems), mouse mAb to transferrin receptor (1:500, Zymed) and mouse mAb to
a-tubulin (1:500; Calbiochem). Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ
software.
Internalization assay. The internalization assay was performed as described63.
PX-RICS þ / þ and PX-RICS � / � cortical neurons (14 DIV) were surface-labelled
with rabbit pAb to g2 as described above. After being rinsed in PBS, the neurons
were incubated at 37 �C for 1 h in conditioned medium containing 100 mg ml � 1
leupeptin (SIGMA) to allow internalization of the labelled surface proteins. The
neurons were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-labelled anti-rabbit IgG for
30 min at RT to visualize the surface-labelled proteins. After fixation, blocking and
permeabilization as described above, internalized proteins were visualized with
Alexa Fluor 488-labelled anti-rabbit IgG. The settings of the microscope, lasers and
detectors were kept unchanged during image acquisition.
Electrophysiological analysis. To measure IPSCs, hippocampal slices were
prepared, and whole-cell patch–clamp recordings were performed as previously
described39. Briefly, PX-RICS þ / þ and PX-RICS � / � mice 6–8 weeks old were
anesthetized deeply with halothane and decapitated, and then, the brains were
removed. Transverse hippocampal slices (400-mm thick) were cut with a tissue

 slicer (Vibratome 1500 or Vibratome 3000) in Krebs–Ringer solution (119.0 mM
NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.0 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgSO4, 26.2 mM
NaHCO3 and 11.0 mM glucose) saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The slices
were incubated for at least 1 h at RT in an interface-type holding chamber filled
with Krebs–Ringer solution, and then, a slice was transferred to a submersion-type
recording chamber, where the solution was perfused at 1.5–2.0 ml min � 1 at 25 �C.
Whole-cell patch–clamp recordings were made from pyramidal cells in the CA1
region, and the membrane potential was clamped at � 70 mV. A recording patch
pipette (3–6 MO) was filled with the internal solution (140 mM CsCl, 10.0 mM
HEPES, 0.2 mM EGTA, 2.0 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na3GTP, 8.0 mM NaCl and
5.0 mM QX314 (pH 7.2, 295–305 mOsm)). mIPSCs were recorded in the presence
of the non-NMDA-receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione
(10 mM), the NMDA-receptor antagonist D-( � )-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic
acid (D-AP5: 50 mM) and the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin
(1 mM; all from Tocris Bioscience). mIPSCs were analysed using the Mini Analysis
(6.0.7) software (Synaptosoft). Of all the events detected, only the events that did
not overlap with other events were accepted for mIPSC amplitude analysis, whereas
all the events were included in the interval analysis. Any significant difference of
the median of mIPSC amplitudes and intervals between the genotypes was
evaluated with the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Mouse cortical neurons (14 DIV)
were lysed in lysis buffer T. The lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose
(GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 �C. Precleared lysates (100–500 mg of protein) were
incubated with 5 mg of the indicated antibody for 1 h at 4 �C, and then, the
immunocomplexes were adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 �C. After
washing extensively with lysis buffer T, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by
SDS–PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore).
The blots were probed with primary antibodies as indicated and visualized with
alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega). Images have
been cropped for presentation (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Full-size images
are presented in Supplementary Figs 9 and 10.
Immunofluorescence. Mouse cortical neurons (14 DIV) were fixed with cold
methanol for 20 min at � 20 �C and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in
Tris-buffered saline for 5 min. The neurons were stained with the indicated
combinations of primary antibodies for 60 min at RT. Staining patterns were
visualized by incubating with the Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 594- or Alexa Fluor
647-conjugated donkey secondary antibodies (1:500; Invitrogen) for 60 min at RT.
The cell images were obtained with an LSM510META laser scanning confocal
microscope (Zeiss). For immunofluorescence of 14-3-3z/y and dynactin1, the
following antibodies were used: rabbit pAb to 14-3-3z (1:50; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); rabbit pAb to 14-3-3y (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and
mouse mAb to dynactin1 (1:250; Transduction Laboratories). For double
immunofluorescent staining of g2 and early endosome antigen 1 in Supplementary
Fig. 3g, mouse mAb to g2 (1:500; Synaptic Systems) and rabbit pAb to early
endosome antigen 1 (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology) were used. Cell nuclei were
visualized with TO-PRO-3 iodide (1:10,000; Invitrogen). Quantitative analyses of
the colocalization were performed using ImageJ, based on the previously reported
method42.
Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Density gradient ultracentrifuga-
tion was performed as described elsewhere23. Mouse cortical neurons were washed
twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer D (25 mM HEPES–KOH
(pH 6.8), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% digitonin, protease inhibitor cocktail
and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail) at 4 �C for 60 min. After centrifugation at
17,000g for 30 min, the supernatant (1.5 mg of protein per 0.5 ml) was layered over
an 11.5-ml 10–40% (w/v) linear sucrose density gradient containing 25 mM
HEPES–KOH (pH 6.8), 150 mM NaCl and 0.4% digitonin. After centrifugation for
15 h at 35,000 r.p.m. in a Beckman SW40 rotor, 12 fractions each containing 1 ml
were collected from the top of the tube and subjected to immunoblotting or
immunoprecipitation. The antibodies used in immunoblotting were as follows:
rabbit pAb to a1 (1:1,000; Synaptic Systems); rabbit pAb to g2 (1:1,000; Synaptic
Systems); rabbit pAb to 14-3-3z (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse mAb to
14-3-3y (1:5,000; SIGMA); mouse mAb to dynactin1 (1:250; Transduction
Laboratories); and mouse mAb to KIF5 (1:200; Millipore). Protein mobility
markers (high-molecular-weight native marker kit; GE Healthcare) were applied to
a parallel gradient, and their fraction positions were determined by 2–15% native
PAGE, followed by Coomassie brilliant blue staining.
siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Each subunit of cytoplasmic dynein and
dynactin exists in a huge variety of distinct isoforms due to multiple genes and
complicated neuron-specific alternative splicing64. We thus conducted functional
knockdown of the dynein/dynactin motor complex by silencing dynactin1
expression because dynactin1 provides the only documented interaction between
dynactin and dynein64. The sequences for stealth RNAi siRNAs (Invitrogen) were
as follows:
siGabarap-1, 50-AAACAAGGCAUCUUCAGCACGGAGA-30; siGabarap-2,
50-AAAGAAGUCUUCUUCAUGGUGUUCC-30; si14-3-3z-1, 50-UUGAGGGCC
AGACCCAGUCUGAUGG-30; si14-3-3z-2, 50-UUUGCAAGAGAGCAGGCUU
UCUCUG-30; si14-3-3y-1, 50-AGAGGUGUCGGUCUUCUGCUCAAUG-30;
si14-3-3y-2, 50-AUCAAACGCCUCUUGGUAGGCUCCU-30; siDctn1-1, 50-UUA
ACUCCUUGAUAACUGUCUCUCG-30; and siDctn1-2, 50-UGCCCAUGUAGA
CUGUGUCAUCUUG-30.
Stealth RNAi negative control medium GC duplex (Invitrogen) is denoted as
siControl in the figures. The primary cultured mouse neurons (10 DIV) were
transfected with siRNAs (10 nM) plus Red Fluorescent Oligo (10 nM; Invitrogen)
using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Three
hours after transfection, the media were replaced with conditioned media. The
silencing effect was evaluated by immunofluorescence 96 h after transfection.
Immunofluorescence and surface labelling of siRNA-transfected neurons were
performed as described above.
PX-RICS mutants. PX-RICS mutants were generated by PCR-based
mutagenesis22,23. PX-RICS-DRSKSDP, a mutant lacking the 14-3-3-binding motif
(amino acids 1,793–1,798); PX-RICS-S1796A, a mutant in which Ser-1796, the
CaMKII phosphorylation site in the 14-3-3 binding motif, was replaced with Ala;
PX-RICS-DGBR, a mutant lacking the GABARAP-binding region (amino acids
562–796). These mutants were cloned in frame into the mammalian expression
vector pcDNA3.1( þ )-FLAG.
Statistical analysis. All experiments were performed blind to genotypes and/or
treatments. The number of mice used in each test is included in Supplementary
Table 1. Sampling and experimental replicates in cell biological and electro-
physiological analyses are described in the figure legends. No criteria were applied
for inclusion and exclusion of data. No outliers were taken into account and all
collected data were subjected to statistical analyses. All data are represented as
means±s.e.m. and analysed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s
post hoc test, two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni’s post hoc test, binomial
test, Student’s t-test and w2-test. All the statistical analyses were performed using
Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Full statistical data for the behavioural
tests are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
