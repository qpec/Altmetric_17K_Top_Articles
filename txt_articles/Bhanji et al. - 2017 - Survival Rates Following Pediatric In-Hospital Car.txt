Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Nearly 6000 hospitalized children in the United States receive cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR) annually. Little is known about whether the survival of these children is 
influenced by the time of the event (eg, nighttime or weekends). Differences in survival could have 
important implications for hospital staffing, training, and resource allocation.
OBJECTIVE—To determine whether outcomes after pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests differ 
during nights and weekends compared with days/evenings and weekdays.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—This study included a total of 354 hospitals 
participating in the American Heart Association’s Get With the Guidelines–Resuscitation registry

 from January 1, 2000, to December 12, 2012. Index cases (12 404 children) from all children 
younger than 18 years of age receiving CPR for at least 2 minutes were included. Data analysis 
was performed in December 2014 and June 2016. We aggregated hourly blocks of time, using 
previously defined time intervals of day/evening and night, as well as weekend. Multivariable 
logistic regression models were used to examine the effect of independent variables on survival to 
hospital discharge. We used a combination of a priori variables based on previous literature 
(including age, first documented rhythm, location of event in hospital, extracorporeal CPR, and 
hypotension as the cause of arrest), as well as variables that were identified in bivariate 
generalized estimating equation models, and maintained significance of P ≤ .15 in the final 
multivariable models.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The primary outcome measure was survival to 
hospital discharge, and secondary outcomes included return of circulation lasting more than 20 
minutes and 24-hour survival.
RESULTS—Of 12 404 children (56.0% were male), 8731 (70.4%) experienced a return of 
circulation lasting more than 20 minutes, 7248 (58.4%) survived for 24 hours, and 4488 (36.2%) 
survived to hospital discharge. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the rate of 
survival to hospital discharge was lower during nights than during days/evenings (adjusted odds 
ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80–0.97]; P = .007) but was not different between weekends and weekdays 
(adjusted odds ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.84–1.01]; P = .09).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—The rate of survival to hospital discharge was lower for 
pediatric CPR events occurring at night than for CPR events occurring during daytime and evening 
hours, even after adjusting for many potentially confounding patient-, event-, and hospital-related 
factors.
Nearly 6000 children in the United States receive inhospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR) each year,1 with a rate of 2% to 6% in pediatric intensive care settings.2,3 Most of 
these children do not survive to hospital discharge.4 Although survival rates following 
pediatric inhospital CPR have improved over the last decade, the variability in survival rates 
suggests potential opportunities for improvement.5,6
Recent prehospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest studies of adults, as well as a prehospital 
study of children, have demonstrated worse outcomes for patients who had a cardiac arrest at 
night rather than during the day.7–12 Similar in-hospital studies of children are lacking and 
could yield different results based on the progressive nature of respiratory failure and shock 
that typically precede pediatric cardiac arrest,4 theoretically making it a more predictable 
event.
The American Heart Association’s Get With the Guidelines–Resuscitation (GWTG-R) 
registry is a large multicenter registry of in-hospital cardiac arrests with standardized data 
reporting methods. We used the GWTG-R database to evaluate survival rates for children 
who had an in-hospital cardiac arrest by time of day and day of week. We hypothesized that 
outcomes would be worse during nights and weekends, even when adjusted for potential 
confounding patient-, event-, and hospital-related factors.

 Methods
The GWTG-R registry is the only national registry of inhospital cardiac arrests in North 
America. The primary purpose is quality improvement based on the recording of de-
identified data in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. 
Data are collected prospectively, and participation in the registry is voluntary. The GWTG-R 
registry uses standardized definitions and reporting forms based on the Utstein template,13,14 
allowing for more uniform practice in the collection and review of resuscitation data. Details 
of hospital certification, data collection and reporting methods, and integrity verification 
have previously been reported.7,15
Adult and pediatric patients, employees, and visitors requiring resuscitation in a hospital 
facility were eligible for inclusion in the registry. The 6 domains of data that were collected 
relate to (1) facility data, (2) patient demographic data, (3) pre-event data, (4) event data, (5) 
outcome data, and (6) quality improvement data.16
Institutional review board approval was not required for participation in the continuous 
quality improvement activities of the registry but was obtained from the McGill University 
Faculty of Medicine institutional review board for this research study. Informed consent was 
not required because the data were deidentified.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
All children younger than 18 years of age who received CPR for at least 2 minutes were 
eligible for inclusion in this study. Only index events were included (ie, the first CPR event) 
for any pa tient receiving CPR more than once during a hospitalization. Exclusion criteria 
were children whose resuscitation began outside of the hospital, newborns who experienced 
cardiac arrest in the delivery room, cardiac arrests that involved an obstetric patient, events 
that were limited to a shock by an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or events that 
occurred in a patient with a do-not-attempt-resuscitation order. Sequential data from 354 
participating hospitals from January 1, 2000, to December 12, 2012, were analyzed.
Outcomes
The prospectively selected primary outcome variable was survival to hospital discharge. 
Secondary outcome variables included return of circulation lasting more than 20 minutes 
and 24-hour survival. Patients who survived to the initiation of extracorporeal CPR or 
cardiopulmonary bypass were included as having a return of circulation.
Exposures
We aggregated hourly blocks of time, with day/evening defined as 7:00 AM to 10:59 PM 
and night as 11:00 PM to 6:59 AM. Weekdays were defined as 7:00 AM on Monday until 
10:59 PM on Friday, and weekends were defined as 11:00 PM on Friday to 6:59 AM on 
Monday.7 Using time of day (day/evening vs night) and weekend/weekday categories, we 
compared primary (survival to hospital discharge) and secondary outcome variables using 
the χ2 test. We applied locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression methods to 
confirm the time of breaking point for sensitivity analyses.

 Secondary Analysis
To compare outcomes during days vs nights, we chose to aggregate and compare 7-hour 
epochs from 9 AM to 4 PM vs midnight to 7 AM as time frames that would consistently be 
considereddaysandnightsirrespectiveofhospitalstaffingpatterns. Again, using time of day 
(day vs night) and weekend/weekday categories, we compared survival to hospital discharge 
among children. Monday to Friday were considered as weekdays, and Saturday and Sunday 
were considered as weekends. For the nights, Monday to Thursday were considered 
weekdays, while Friday to Sunday were considered weekends.
Statistical Analysis
Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the effect of independent 
variables on survival to hospital discharge, 24-hour survival, and return of circulation. 
Selection of a priori variables was based on previous literature and included age, first 
documented rhythm, location of event in hospital, extracorporeal CPR, and hypotension as 
the cause of arrest.17 The final multivariable model was developed by fitting bivariate 
generalized estimating equation (GEE) models for each potential confounder and including 
the variable in the subsequent stage of analysis if the statistical significance was P ≤ .10 for 
the primary outcome. Notably, the GEE model accounts for clustering by site. Next, all of 
these selected variables were included in a multivariable GEE model for each time of day 
and weekday/weekend exposure. If a variable remained statistically significant at a level of P 
≤ .15 for the primary outcome, it was incorporated into the final multivariable model. We 
included patient’s sex in the final multivariable GEE models, although it did not meet all of 
the criteria already described.
The final multivariable GEE model for survival to discharge included several potential 
confounders: age; sex; race; illness category; preexisting sepsis; hypotension as the cause of 
arrest; metabolic or electrolyte disturbance; location of event in hospital; 
electrocardiographic monitoring; presence of arterial lines; central venous access or 
mechanical ventilation at the time of the cardiac arrest; vasoactive infusions of dobuta-mine, 
dopamine, or epinephrine; first documented rhythm; duration of CPR; epinephrine use; 
extracorporeal CPR; and the use of pharmacologic interventions of atropine, sodium 
bicarbonate, calcium chloride, or gluconate and lidocaine.
All P values are 2 sided with a significance level set at .05. Statistical analyses were 
performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
There were 12 404 index pediatric CPR events that met the inclusion criteria over the 12-
year, 11-month period. Of these events, 8568 occurred during daytime or evening hours, and 
3836 occurred at night. Weekday cardiac arrests (between 7 AM on Monday to 11 PM on 
Friday) accounted for 8586 events, and the remaining 3818 cardiac arrests occurred on 
weekends. The 354 hospitals contributing data during this time period had a median size of 
333 beds (interquartile range, 219–499 beds), including 16 that were self-classified as 
“freestanding” children’s hospitals.

 Patients’ characteristics, presented by time of day (day/evening vs night), are outlined in 
Table 1. Patients experiencing a CPR event at night were not different from those 
experiencing an event during the day with respect to age, sex, hypotensive cause of the 
cardiac arrest, or first documented rhythm. A higher percentage of patients had their CPR 
event in an intensive care setting at night compared with in the day/evening. However, fewer 
patients had a witnessed event at night. Patients’ characteristics, presented by day of the 
week (weekday vs weekend), are outlined in Table 1. Patients expe riencing a CPR event on 
weekends were not different from those experiencing an event during weekdays with respect 
to age, sex, hypotensive cause of the cardiac arrest, or first documented rhythm. A higher 
percentage of patients had their CPR event in an intensive care setting on weekends 
compared with on weekdays, yet fewer had a witnessed event on weekends.
Of 12 404 children, 8731 (70.4%) experienced a return of circulation lasting more than 20 
minutes, 7248 (58.4%) survived for 24 hours, and 4488 (36.2%) survived to hospital 
discharge. The unadjusted rate of survival to hospital discharge was lower for children who 
had a CPR event occurring at night (1300 of 3836 [33.9%]) than for children who had a CPR 
event occurring during the day or evening (3188 of 8568 [37.2%]) (P < .001). Similarly, the 
unadjusted rate of survival to hospital discharge was lower on weekends (1266 of 3818 
children [33.2%]) than weekdays (3222 of 8586 children [37.5%]) (P < .001). Survival to 
hospital discharge is characterized by the hour of the day in Figure 1 and by the day of the 
week in Figure 2, with worse outcomes on Saturday and Sunday.
After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the rate of survival to hospital 
discharge remained lower at night than during the day/evening (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 
0.88 [95% CI, 0.80–0.97]; P = .007). Although the absolute rate of survival to hospital 
discharge remained lower on weekends than on weekdays, this difference did not reach 
statistical significance (adjusted OR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.84–1.01]; P = .09).
Adjusted rates of 24-hour survival were lower at night than during the day/evening (adjusted 
OR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73–0.87]; P < .001) and were lower during the weekends than during 
the weekdays (adjusted OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.78–0.97]; P = .01). Return of circulation was 
not significantly different at night compared with during the day/evening and was not 
significantly different during weekends compared with week-days (Table 2 and Table 3). 
Using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression methods, we identified 7 PM as an 
appropriate breaking point for sensitivity analyses.
When categorized as the 7-hour daytime epoch (9 AM to 4 PM) and the 7-hour nighttime 
epoch (midnight to 7 AM) in secondary analysis, 3797 CPR events occurred during the 
daytime epoch, and 3298 CPR events occurred during the nighttime epoch. The unadjusted 
rate of survival to hospital discharge was lower for children who had CPR events during the 
7-hour nighttime epoch than during the 7-hour daytime epoch (33.4% [1102 of 3298] vs 
39.1% [1485 of 3797]; P < .001). After adjusting for a priori (age, first documented rhythm, 
location of event in hospital, extracorporeal CPR, and hypotensive cause of arrest) and all 
known potential confounders, we found that the rate of survival to hospital discharge was 
lower during nighttime epochs than during daytime epochs (adjusted OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 
0.76–0.95]; P = .005).

 The unadjusted rate of survival to hospital discharge was lower during weekend daytime 
epochs than during weekday daytime epochs (33.1% [309 of 933 children] vs 41.1% [1176 
of 2864 children]; P < .001). However, the rate of survival to hospital discharge was not 
demonstrably different on weekend nighttime epochs compared with weekday nighttime 
epochs (32.9% [602 of 1828 children] vs 34.0% [500 of 1470 children]; P = .51). After 
adjusting for potential confounders, we found that the difference in the rate of survival to 
hospital discharge approached significance between weekend daytime epochs and weekday 
daytime epochs (adjusted OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.70–1.02]; P = .07) but not between weekend 
nighttime epochs and weekday nighttime epochs (adjusted OR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.79–1.12]; P 
= .51).
Discussion
In the large, prospective GWTG-R in-hospital cardiac arrest registry, the rate of survival to 
hospital discharge was lower for pediatric CPR events occurring at night than for CPR 
events occurring during daytime and evening hours, even after adjusting for many 
potentially confounding patient-, event-, and hospital-related factors. The lower survival rate 
among these children whose cardiac arrests occurred at nighttime are consistent with the 
lower survival rates among adults whose in-hospital cardiac arrests occurred at nighttime.7 
In addition, a recent pediatric out-of-hospital investigation12 showed a lower rate of survival 
to hospital discharge when the cardiac arrest occurred at nighttime despite no difference in 
the rate of return of spontaneous circulation at nighttime. Kitamura et al12 postulated that the 
differences in survival may have been related to differences in postresus-citation care once 
the patients arrived in the hospital. Similar findings of lower survival at night were noted for 
adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.8
Lower survival rates at nighttime are an important, yet underrecognized public health 
concern. This is especially pertinent because suboptimal resuscitative efforts are a 
potentially preventable harm.18 Assuming an annual CPR rate of 6000 events per year, we 
found that simply improving overall survival (currently at 36.2%) to match the weekday 
daytime epoch survival (41.1%) would result in almost 300 additional children’s lives saved 
per year in the United States. These findings may have important implications for hospital 
staffing, training, and resource allocation.
Although the results of our study are concerning, they are not entirely surprising because 
they align with pediatric literature demonstrating worse outcomes for critically ill children 
admitted to pediatric intensive care units during the evening and nighttime,19 as well as for 
newborns who may require resuscitation.20,21 Interestingly, the study by Stewart et al21 also 
demonstrated worse outcomes for newborns during the months of July and August when 
staffing of hospitals is typically reduced and when more senior physicians are less likely to 
be present.
Potential causes for the decreased survival rate after pediatric cardiac arrest at night are 
important to identify. Hospitals tend to have fewer senior health care professionals22 and 
more junior health care professionals working at night,23 perhaps influencing the recognition 
and response to deteriorating patients and those experiencing cardiac arrest. In addition,

 medical error is more common,24 and there is reduced proficiency in performing 
psychomotor skills25 at night. None theless, performance in other appropriately staffed and 
resourced time-sensitive domains, such as trauma,26 has overcome the so-called weekend 
effect. In the GWTG-R adult study7 comparing survival after in-hospital cardiac during 
daytime/evenings vs nights, survival rates were only similar for the 2 time periods in the 
emergency department and trauma service—2 domains that tend to have more consistent 
coverage with titrated staffing patterns and the presence of attending physicians throughout 
the day, evening, and night.
Similarly, the rates of return of spontaneous circulation were not different between nights 
and weekends in the study on pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, whereas the rates of 
30-day survival were.12 Again, these data on pediatric outof-hospital cardiac arrests suggest 
that the “night” and “weekend” effects may have been overcome in the emergency medical 
services system but not in the hospital system.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. 
Participation in the GWTG-R registry is voluntary, with the potential for a selection bias of 
participating centers that could limit extrapolation.27 The data were accumulated over a long 
time period, from 2000 to 2012, when secular trends in resuscitation education and practice 
may have taken place, which might have masked some diurnal or weekday/weeknight 
variation. Second, the large GWTG-R data set, based on the Utstein template, allows for the 
adjustment for a large number of potential confounders but cannot account for unmeasured 
confounding variables. Third, the primary outcome variable in this study was survival to 
hospital discharge. Unfortunately, neurological outcome data were frequently missing for 
patients included in this study, thereby limiting our ability to address this important outcome 
without potential biases. Fourth, although the study does highlight an important public 
health concern, it does not identify the underlying causes for the differences in survival.
Future research might explore the effect of hospital staffing, better patient monitoring with 
earlier detection of decompensation, the presence of a rapid response team, the quality of 
CPR,28–30 post-event quantitative debriefing,31,32 and postarrest management (eg, targeted 
temperature management or hemo-dynamic support33) on the differential survival during 
day/evening vs night. Although these observational findings do not identify the specific 
mechanisms that will eliminate disparity in night vs day survival, they may have important 
implications for hospital staffing, training, and resource allocation. Of note, the absolute 
difference in witnessed cardiac arrests was relatively 
smallatnightcomparedwithduringtheday/evening(1.1%),even though it was statistically 
significant. An alternative explanationoftheday-night difference is that there are different 
pathologies operating at night.Aformalcost-benefitorcost-effectiveness study would be 
required to assess the cost, personnel, and education that would be required to achieve 
daytime/nighttime and weekday/weekend parity in survival outcomes.
A final limitation of the study may have been the lack of power to demonstrate differences in 
outcomes on weekends. The absolute rate of survival during the weekend daytime (33%) 
was lower than during the weekday daytime (41%) and was quite similar to the absolute rate

 of survival during the week-day nighttime (34%). Nevertheless, the adjusted OR for 
weekend daytime survival to hospital discharge was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.70–1.02) (P = .07). We 
speculate that the much smaller number of patients in this pediatric GWTG-R study may 
have masked the true difference in outcomes on weekends in contrast to the adult GWTG-R 
study that showed worse outcomes on weekend daytimes.7
Conclusions
In this large, prospective GWTG-R in-hospital cardiac arrest registry, the rate of survival to 
hospital discharge was lower for pediatric patients who experienced CPR events at night 
than for those who experienced CPR events during daytime and evening hours, even after 
adjusting for important potentially confounding patient-, event-, and hospital-related factors. 
Although the absolute rate of survival to hospital discharge was lower on weekends than 
weekdays, this difference did not reach statistical significance when adjusted for 
confounding factors. Discrepancy between daytime and nighttime outcomes represents an 
important patient safety concern that warrants further investigation.

 Key Points
Question
Do survival rates after pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests differ during nights and 
weekends compared with days/evenings and weekdays?
Findings
In this national registry-based cohort study of hospitalized children younger than 18 years 
of age receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the rate of survival to hospital 
discharge was 36.2% (4488 of 12 404 children) overall. After adjusting for important 
potential confounders, we found that the rate of survival to hospital discharge was 
significantly lower during nights than during days/evenings, but there was no difference 
between weekends and weekdays.
Meaning
The rate of survival to hospital discharge was lower for pediatric CPR events occurring at 
night than for CPR events occurring during daytime and evening hours.
