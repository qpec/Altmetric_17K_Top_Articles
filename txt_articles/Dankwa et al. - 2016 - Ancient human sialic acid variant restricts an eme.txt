Plasmodium knowlesi is a zoonotic parasite transmitted from macaques causing malaria in
humans in Southeast Asia. Plasmodium parasites bind to red blood cell (RBC) surface
receptors, many of which are sialylated. While macaques synthesize the sialic acid variant
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), humans cannot because of a mutation in the enzyme
CMAH that converts N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) to Neu5Gc. Here we reconstitute
CMAH in human RBCs for the reintroduction of Neu5Gc, which results in enhancement of
P. knowlesi invasion. We show that two P. knowlesi invasion ligands, PkDBPb and PkDBPg, bind
specifically to Neu5Gc-containing receptors. A human-adapted P. knowlesi line invades human
RBCs independently of Neu5Gc, with duplication of the sialic acid-independent invasion
ligand, PkDBPa and loss of PkDBPg. Our results suggest that absence of Neu5Gc on human
RBCs limits P. knowlesi invasion, but that parasites may evolve to invade human RBCs through
the use of sialic acid-independent pathways.

iverse pathogens including bacteria1,2, parasites3,4 and
many different viruses5,6 take advantage of the ubiquity of
sialic acids on the surface of mammalian cells to attach to
and infect host cells6. Sialic acids are a family of acidic sugars
usually found at the termini of glycan chains on proteins and
lipids7. The most common forms of sialic acid on mammalian
cells
are
N-acetylneuraminic
acid
(Neu5Ac)
and
N-
glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Humans express Neu5Ac,
but lack Neu5Gc because of an Alu-mediated exon deletion in the
gene encoding cytidine monophosphate Neu5Ac hydroxylase
(CMAH), which converts Neu5Ac to Neu5Gc8–10. This CMAH
gene inactivation occurred B3.2 Myr ago11, around a time of
active hominin evolution12, and is shared by Neanderthals13,
extinct hominins closely related to humans.
In contrast to the human lineage, CMAH is functional in great
apes. Variation between human (Neu5Ac) and great ape
(Neu5Gc) sialic acid was posited to underlie the host specificity
exhibited by the evolutionarily related Laverania parasites,
P. falciparum and P. reichenowi, which infect humans and
chimpanzees,
respectively14.
However,
recent
work
has
challenged the view that Neu5Gc is a key host determinant of
the tropism exhibited by P. falciparum and other Laverania
parasites15,16.
P. knowlesi is unique among the human malaria-causing
parasites because it displays significant cross-species transmis-
sion. P. knowlesi chronically infects Neu5Gc-positive long-tailed
and pig-tailed macaques, as well as Neu5Ac-positive humans17.
Most human blood-stage infections are mild and associated with
low parasitaemias18, but increasing numbers of severe infections
accompanied by high parasitaemias are being reported19,20. There
is growing concern that this simian parasite is adapting to infect
humans more efficiently. It has been shown that P. knowlesi can
expand its preferred host cell niche by invading older red blood
cells (RBCs)21, and this is an important factor influencing
adaptation of P. knowlesi to the human population.
In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that Neu5Gc is a
key determinant of P. knowlesi tropism. We modified human
RBCs by introducing Neu5Gc on the cell surface through
expression of chimpanzee CMAH in ex vivo-cultured RBCs
(cRBCs)22,23. We show that while Neu5Gc expression has no
effect on P. falciparum invasion, it significantly increases
P. knowlesi invasion. Further, both PkDBPb and PkDBPg,
which belong to the Duffy binding protein (DBP) ligand
family,
bind
to
Neu5Gc-sialylated
receptors,
potentially
facilitating invasion of Neu5Gc-expressing human cRBCs. In
demonstrating that a human-adapted P. knowlesi lab strain
efficiently invades Neu5Gc-expressing human cRBCs in a sialic
acid-independent manner, we identify a potential host factor that
P. knowlesi must overcome for efficient adaptation to humans.
Results
CMAH expression introduces Neu5Gc on human RBCs. An
analysis of the genomes of a large range of mammalian species
indicates that CMAH loss is infrequent (Supplementary Fig. 1).
The genomic sequence of a Denisovan24, an extinct species of the
human lineage, has an exon deletion in CMAH like humans and
Neanderthals, which would result in the loss of expression of
Neu5Gc (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Fig. 2). Among primates, CMAH
genetic inactivation has also occurred in New World monkeys25
(Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1), which serve as model organisms
for the human P. falciparum and P. vivax parasites26.
To determine whether host sialic acid variation impacts
P. knowlesi tropism, we expressed the CMAH gene from
chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) in human CD34 þ haematopoietic
stem cells by transduction, with lentivirus harbouring the
chimpanzee CMAH transgene (PtCMAH) or an empty vector
(pLVX; Fig. 1b). Terminal differentiation to mature cRBCs22,23
resulted in transgenic human cRBCs expressing PtCMAH or
wild-type control cRBCs with an inactive human CMAH. Both
sets of cells displayed normal RBC morphology (Fig. 1c) and had
similar
expression
of
the
major
glycosylated
receptors,
glycophorin A and glycophorin C, as well as the Duffy antigen
receptor for chemokines (DARC; Supplementary Fig. 3), a critical
human receptor for P. knowlesi invasion27. PtCMAH cRBCs, but
not pLVX cRBCs, expressed Neu5Gc as shown by flow cytometry
(Fig. 1d), and western blot analysis where we observed that
Neu5Gc is added to a range of proteins of varying molecular
weights (Fig. 1e). Using high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), we found that on PtCMAH cRBCs, Neu5Gc constitutes
B70% of total sialic acid, while Neu5Ac is reduced to B30% of
the amount found on pLVX cells (Fig. 1f; Supplementary
Table 1), consistent with the proportion of Neu5Gc and
Neu5Ac observed in chimpanzees28.
Neu5Gc on human RBCs enhances P. knowlesi invasion. To
determine the effect of human Neu5Gc expression on P. knowlesi,
we tested invasion of the P. knowlesi H strain into RBCs
expressing different sialic acid variants. As expected, we found
that P. knowlesi invasion into Neu5Gc-positive rhesus macaque
RBCs is more efficient than Neu5Ac-positive human RBCs
(Fig. 2a). With the transgenic and isogenic cRBCs differing solely
in the expressed sialic acid variant, we observed that P. knowlesi
invades
Neu5Gc-positive
PtCMAH
cRBCs
at
significantly
increased levels (greater than fivefold, P ¼ 0.012; Student’s t-test
(two-tailed)) compared with Neu5Ac-positive pLVX cRBCs
(Fig. 2a), bringing the level of P. knowlesi invasion close to that
found for macaque RBCs. This provides direct functional evi-
dence that the absence of Neu5Gc is a major restriction factor for
P. knowlesi invasion of human RBCs. Our in vitro culture system
produces cRBCs of similar age, as indicated by CD71 expression
(Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting that Neu5Gc mediates inva-
sion independently of RBC age21.
P. falciparum is not affected by Neu5Gc on human RBCs. To
directly determine the impact of cell surface Neu5Gc on P. fal-
ciparum invasion, we assessed invasion of the P. falciparum sialic
acid-dependent and sialic acid-independent laboratory-adapted
strains, Dd2 and 3D7, respectively, into RBCs expressing different
sialic acid variants. As expected, P. falciparum Dd2 and 3D7
invaded human RBCs, but not macaque RBCs29 (Fig. 2b,c).
However, in contrast to P. knowlesi, both P. falciparum strains
invaded PtCMAH cRBCs and pLVX cRBCs at similar levels
(Fig. 2b,c), suggesting that P. falciparum can utilise both Neu5Ac
and Neu5Gc. This supports the biochemical evidence that the
major sialic acid-dependent
invasion ligand P. falciparum
erythrocyte-binding antigen-175 does not discriminate between
Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc15,16. The PtCMAH cRBCs have B30% of
the normal complement of Neu5Ac that might be sufficient for
efficient invasion. However, this is not supported by the finding
that an enzymatic reduction of Neu5Ac to B30% normal levels
on human RBCs results in significantly decreased invasion by
P. falciparum sialic acid-dependent lines (Supplementary Fig. 4).
PkDBPb and PkDBPc bind to sialylated receptors. To identify
the molecular determinants of sialic acid-dependent invasion in
P. knowlesi, we recombinantly expressed the binding domains of
the P. knowlesi DBP ligands, PkDBPa, PkDBPb and PkDBPg30
(Supplementary Fig. 5a,b), as fusions with the cartilage oligomeric
matrix protein (COMP) pentamerization domain31. PkDBPa
binds to the DARC receptor32, while PkDBPb and PkDBPg have

 been shown to bind rhesus macaque RBCs33. We assessed
binding of recombinant PkDBP domains to normal and enzyme-
treated human and rhesus macaque RBC ghosts in protein
overlay
assays.

expected,

ghosts
(chymotrypsin
cleaves DARC). However, binding to untreated and trypsin-
treated macaque ghosts, as well as macaque ghosts stripped of
sialic acid by neuraminidase treatment was preserved (Fig. 3a), as
expected32,33. In contrast, PkDBPb and PkDBPg did not bind to
neuraminidase-treated macaque RBC ghosts, demonstrating that
PkDBPb and PkDBPg are both sialic acid-binding ligands
(Fig. 3b). The sialic acid dependence of PkDBPb has been
reported previously34, but the same study concludes that PkDBPg
binds to macaque RBCs in a sialic acid-independent manner. Our
protein overlay and orthogonal flow cytometry-based-binding
data (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Fig. 6) strongly suggest that PkDBPg
is also a sialic acid-dependent invasion ligand. The binding
pattern for PkDBPb and PkDBPg to proteins within the RBC
ghost overlays was different, however, implying a diversification
for binding to different macaque receptors. As expected, PkDBPb
and PkDBPg did not bind to human RBC ghosts, and glutathione
s-transferase (GST) control protein did not bind to either cell type
(Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 5d).
PkDBPb and PkDBPc bind to Neu5Gc receptors. Since
PkDBPb and PkDBPg bound macaque but not human RBCs in a
sialic acid-dependent manner, we sought to determine if binding
was a function of a preference for Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac. To this
end, we assayed binding of increasing concentrations of PkDBPb

 and PkDBPg to PtCMAH cRBCs, using a flow cytometry-based
binding assay (Supplementary Fig. 7a). We observed dose-
dependent binding of both PkDBPb and PkDBPg to PtCMAH
cRBCs, but not control pLVX cRBCs (Fig. 3c; Supplementary
Fig. 7a), suggesting that Neu5Gc is strictly required for binding.
Furthermore, neuraminidase treatment of PtCMAH cRBCs
abrogated binding (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Fig. 7b). Similarly, we
observed Neu5Gc-dependent binding to protein receptors in
cRBC overlay assays (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Together, our
experiments indicate that PkDBPb and PkDBPg are Neu5Gc-
binding ligands that can enhance invasion into Neu5Gc-expres-
sing RBCs.
We observed stronger binding of PkDBPg to rhesus RBCs
relative to PtCMAH cRBCs potentially because of a differing
linkage between the terminal sialic acid and the proximal sugar or
significant differences in the structure of the protein backbone of
the orthologous receptor on PtCMAH cRBCs. Both sialic acid–
sugar linkage and protein backbone have been shown to be
important for sialic acid-dependent ligand–receptor interactions
in P. falciparum35–37.
Human-adapted P. knowlesi invasion is Neu5Gc-independent.
Increased invasion into human RBCs could be a major factor in
P. knowlesi pathogenesis21. We have adapted P. knowlesi strain H
(Pk H) to grow efficiently in human RBCs, generating a strain
named Pk YH1 hereafter21. To determine how Neu5Gc impacts
the human-adapted P. knowlesi strain, we assessed invasion of Pk
YH1 into PtCMAH cRBCs and pLVX cRBCs. In contrast to the
parental Pk H strain, Pk YH1 invasion into PtCMAH cRBCs was
not enhanced relative to pLVX cRBCs (Figs 2a and 4a). As
expected, Pk YH1 invaded human and macaque RBCs equally
well (Fig. 4a). These results suggest that Pk YH1 has adapted to
use an altered set of functional invasion ligands for human
infection, circumventing the dependence on Neu5Gc for optimal
invasion.
Whole-genome sequencing of the Pk YH1 and parental Pk H
strains was carried out to identify changes in invasion ligands of
the DBP family and the recently described orthologues of
the
reticulocyte
binding-like
(RBL)
family38.
Sequencing
revealed a duplication of the region containing the sialic acid-
independent PkDBPa gene, as well as a complete deletion of the
sialic acid-dependent PkDBPg gene in Pk YH1 (Fig. 4b;
Supplementary
Fig.
8;
Supplementary
Table
2).
These
alterations
suggest
that
the
mechanism
for
the
observed
increase in Pk YH1 invasion into human RBCs is a shift
towards greater usage of the sialic acid-independent PkDBPa
ligand, and away from the PkDBPb and PkDBPg ligands that are
unable to bind human Neu5Ac.
To test the hypothesis that Pk YH1 has increased usage of the
PkDBPa sialic acid-independent ligand, we assessed the invasion
of Pk YH1 and Pk H into human RBCs in the presence of
increasing concentration of the chemokine melanoma growth
stimulatory activity (MGSA; Fig. 4c). MGSA binds specifically to
DARC and inhibits its interaction with PkDBPa39. We observed a
greater than 10-fold increase in the half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) for Pk YH1 (6 nM) compared with Pk H
(0.5 nM) (Fig. 4c). The requirement for more MGSA for the
inhibition of Pk YH1 is consistent with an increased number of
PkDBPa–DARC
interactions,
resulting
from
PkDBPa
amplification and loss of PkDBPg.
Discussion
In this study, we used an ex vivo RBC culture system coupled with
lentiviral transgene expression of CMAH to specifically and
functionally study Neu5Gc, as a determinant of the tropism
displayed by the zoonotic macaque parasite P. knowlesi. We
provide evidence that P. knowlesi is restricted in its invasion of
human RBCs due to the absence of surface Neu5Gc. Evolutio-
narily, this modified sialic acid was once present in ancestral
humans Myr ago. It is plausible that selective pressure due to a
Plasmodium parasite utilizing this invasion pathway could have
resulted in loss of a functional CMAH in ancestral humans, given
the considerable evidence that malaria has shaped the human
genome4,40. However, fossil records of ancestral macaques in
Africa do not place them in East Africa at the site of CMAH
inactivation, but rather in North Africa, from where they
migrated to Eurasia 5.5 Myr ago41. Thus, an ancestral zoonotic
P. knowlesi species is less likely to have been the selective force for
CMAH loss B3.2 Myr ago. We speculate that a Laverania
parasite, such as P. reichenowi, that infects chimpanzees (which
have Neu5Gc-positive RBCs) is a more likely candidate for the
selective pressure leading to CMAH loss. Regardless of the
origins, we suggest that CMAH gene inactivation in humans is
currently a restriction factor limiting the emergence of P. knowlesi
infections in the human population.
However, the human-adapted Pk YH1 strain used in this study
suggests that P. knowlesi can adapt to overcome this restriction
through duplication of the sialic acid-independent PkDBPa
invasion ligand. Our hypothesis that Pk YH1 has greater and
more efficient usage of the PkDBPa–DARC invasion pathway is
supported by the increased IC50 for Pk YH1 in the MGSA
invasion inhibition assay. We also observed deletion of the
Neu5Gc-dependent PkDBPg, although whether this was a
necessary change concomitant with the duplication of PkDBPa,
remains to be determined.
The space-filling model for the display of invasion ligands at
the apical end of the invading parasite42,43 can be one way to
rationalize how increased expression of PkDBPa and loss of
PkDBPg may enhance invasion of human RBCs. With limited
space at the apex of the parasite for the deployment of invasion
ligands before invasion, increased expression of PkDBPa and
absence of PkDBPg would result in greater release of PkDBPa to

 the apex of the parasite, resulting in an increased number of
productive PkDBPa–DARC interactions. PkDBPb and PkDBPg
are expressed together with PkDBPa in wild-type P. knowlesi44,45,
making plausible the increased apical presentation of PkDBPa in
the absence of PkDBPg in Pk YH1.
The duplication of PkDBPa in Pk YH1 is reminiscent of the
duplication of the closely related P. vivax DBP invasion ligand
observed in P. vivax isolates in Madagascar46. This P. vivax DBP
duplication, likely a recent event, may have been selected for the
efficient invasion of Malagasy individuals, where RBCs that are
either homozygous for DARC-negative alleles or heterozygous for
DARC-negative/DARC-positive alleles are common.
The rise in reported malaria cases due to P. knowlesi infection
in
Southeast
Asia19,20
raises
concern
about
the
possible
occurrence of human-to-human transmission. There is already
evidence suggesting the clustering of P. knowlesi infections in
households, where individuals had not been in proximity to
macaques47,48. In the 1950s, the use of P. knowlesi as a treatment
for tertiary neurosyphilis had to be stopped because of increased
pathogenicity of the parasite, with continuous passaging in
humans49,50. This suggests that increased parasite adaptation to
humans may be associated with severe disease. We suggest that
genetic changes in the DBP invasion ligands might be a sentinel
indicator of increased adaptation to humans.
Methods
Investigation of CMAH gene loss in mammalian evolution. We examined
hominid and mammalian genomes with genome alignments and gene loss analysis.
The mammalian gene loss events were analysed with the program CAFE (Com-
putational Analysis of gene Family Evolution51), a statistical tool for computing the
gene family size evolution that is implemented in Ensembl 72. The gene loss event
in hominins was further verified with independent genomic analysis; the sequence
reads of the Neanderthal52 and Denisovan genomes24 were aligned to chimpanzee
genome panTro3 at the CMAH gene locus with the University of California, Santa
Cruz (UCSC) genome browser53.

 The ferret54 and New World monkey25 CMAH gene loss events are published.
Dog CMAH does not appear to be functional in certain breeds of dogs55,56.
Ex vivo culture of RBCs. Bone-marrow-derived CD34 þ haematopoietic stem
cells (2–3 � 105; Lonza) were cultured in media with 5% solvent/detergent virus-
inactivated human plasma (Octaplas, Octapharma) as described previously57
with the following modifications. On day 6 or 7 of culture, cells were transduced
with lentivirus harbouring either the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) CMAH
complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence in pLVX-Puro (Clontech) or the empty
vector, pLVX-Puro. The CMAH cDNA sequence with a C-terminal tobacco etch
virus (TEV) cleavage site and FLAG-c-myc tags was codon-optimized for human
expression and synthesized (GeneArt). CMAH cDNA was amplified using primers
listed in Supplementary Table 3 and cloned into pLVX-Puro. Transduction
with lentiviral vectors and subsequent selection on 2 mg ml � 1 puromycin
dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) were done as described23, but puromycin was
maintained until day 12 or 13 when cells were co-cultured on a murine MS-5
stromal cell layer at a cell density of 3–6 � 105 cells per ml until day 18 as
described58. On day 18, cells were replated on a fresh MS-5 stromal cell layer
and then collected on day 20 or 21 at which time 70–90% of cells were enucleated.
Cells were stored at 4�C in incomplete RPMI; (consisting of RPMI-1640 (Sigma-
Aldrich) supplemented with 25 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-
piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) and 50 mg l � 1 hypoxanthine), until use in downstream
experiments.
Neu5Gc or RBC receptor expression by flow cytometry. RBCs and cRBCs were
washed three times in PBS containing 0.5% Neu5Gc-free blocking agent (Siamab,
formerly Sialix) and pelleted at 500 g for 4 min in a 96-well plate at 5 � 105 cells per
well. Cells were resuspended in either 50 ml of blocking buffer or 50 ml of the
appropriate antibody solution. The following antibodies were used at the indicated
dilutions: anti-Neu5Gc (1:5,000, Siamab), phycoerythrin(PE)-conjugated anti-
DARC (1:10, Miltenyi Biotec), anti-CD71-PE (1:10, Miltenyi Biotec), fluorescein
isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-glycophorin A (GPA); 1:50, Clone 2B7, STEMCELL
Technologies) and anti-glycophorin C (GPC)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:500,
BRIC 10, Santa Cruz). Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and
washed three times in blocking buffer. Unstained cells and cells stained with
DARC, CD71, GPA and GPC antibodies were resuspended in 100 ml PBS for
analysis on the MACSQuant flow cytometer (Miltenyi Biotec). Neu5Gc-stained
cells were incubated in anti-chicken IgY-Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Life
Technologies) at 1:1,000 for 30 min at room temperature. Control samples were
similarly incubated in anti-mouse IgG2a-PE (1:10, Miltenyi Biotec), anti-chicken
IgY-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody or anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1,000, Life
Technologies). Cells were washed twice and subjected to flow cytometric analysis.
The data were analysed in FlowJo 4 version 10.0.7 (Tree Star).
Measurement of sialic acid by HPLC. For measurement of cell surface sialic acid,
RBC and cRBC ghosts were prepared for sialic acid release as described59, with
some modifications. In brief, 1 � 107 cells were washed once in incomplete RPMI
and twice in PBS pH 7.4. Cells were stored at � 80 �C until RBC ghost preparation,
where thawed RBCs were resuspended in cold 5 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0
containing protease inhibitor cocktail. RBC ghosts were pelleted at 21,130 g for
10 min, washed three times in PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail and
stored at � 80 �C until sialic acid preparation. Sialic acid release from RBC ghosts
was achieved by mild acid hydrolysis as described60, with some modifications. In
brief, RBC ghosts were resuspended in 75 ml 2 M acetic acid and heated at 80 �C
for 3 h. For formation of fluorescent derivatives, 75 ml of derivatization solution
was added to sialic acid samples and heated at 50 �C in the dark for 2.5-3 h.
The derivatization solution was made up of 7 mM 1,2-diamino-4,5-
methylenedioxybenzene dihydrochloride, acetic acid (1.7 M for experimental
samples or 3.7 M for sialic acid standards), 0.75 M b-mercaptoethanol and 18 mM
sodium hydrosulfite. Samples were run on an HPLC with a C18 column at a flow
rate of 0.9 ml min � 1, using a mobile phase of acetonitrile–methanol–water
(9:7:84 v/v). Sialic acid elution was monitored by absorbance at 373 nm. Data were
acquired on Chemstation Rev A. 10.01 (Agilent Technologies). Eluted sialic acids
were compared with a sialic acid reference panel, and Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc
solutions of known amounts for quantitation of sialic acids.
For measurement of sialic acid in invasion assays, neuraminidase treatment of
RBCs was performed in 40 ml total volume. Supernatants were collected and sialic
acid was quantified as described previously61. In brief, cell supernatants were
treated with 20 ml of a freshly prepared solution of 0.2 M sodium periodate in 48%
phosphoric acid for 20 min at room temperature. To terminate the reaction, 100 ml
of freshly prepared 10% sodium arsenite in 0.1 N sulphuric acid was added slowly,
then vortexed until clear and incubated 5 min at room temperature. Finally, 600 ml
of thiobarbituric acid (6 mg ml � 1) was added, and the reaction was incubated at
100 �C for 15 min, then chilled on ice. Samples were analysed on the HPLC as
described above, but elution was performed using a running buffer consisting of
115 mM sodium perchlorate, 30% methanol and 1% phosphoric acid, and
absorbance was monitored at 549 nm.

 as follows. The targeting vector, pDEF-DSSU-hDHFR63, was integrated into Pk H
(provided by A.W. Thomas; Biomedical Primate Research Center, Rijswijk) to form
Pk H SSUD. The P. knowlesi d-ssu gene was then amplified using Pk H SSUD
genomic DNA and primers listed in Supplementary Table 3, and then cloned into
pCG6-attB62. The resulting vector, pSSUD-CG6-attB, was integrated into Pk H
SSUD to form Pk H SSUDattB. In the final step, pBSD-GFP-INT-attP62 was
integrated into Pk H SSUDattB. Pk YH1 was generated in our laboratory from the
parental Pk H strain by growth for 3 months in human O þ RBCs supplemented
with 16% reticulocytes purified from haemochromatosis patient blood21. The
percentage of reticulocytes was decreased to 2–4% for an additional 2 months, after
which parasites proliferated stably in the absence of reticulocyte-enriched blood. P.
falciparum Dd2 and W2mef strains used in invasion assays with neuraminidase-
treated RBCs were obtained from the Malaria Research and Reference Reagent
Resource.
P. falciparum cultures and the human-adapted Pk YH1 line were maintained in
human RBCs (Research Blood Components), while P. knowlesi H SSUDattB/BSD-
GFP was grown in rhesus macaque RBCs (New England Primate Research Center).
Parasites were grown at 2% haematocrit in complete RPMI (RPMI supplemented
with 25 mM HEPES, 50 mg l � 1 hypoxanthine, 2.57 mM sodium bicarbonate and
0.5% AlbuMAX II (Life Technologies)).
Enzyme treatments. For RBC binding assays, enzyme treatments were performed
as described42. In brief, RBCs or cRBCs were washed three times in incomplete
RPMI and treated with 1 mg ml � 1 trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) and/or 1 mg ml � 1
chymotrypsin (Worthington) and/or 66.7 mU ml � 1 Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 �C with gentle mixing for 1 h. RBCs were then washed twice
in incomplete RPMI and once in PBS pH 7.4.
For neuraminidase treatment for invasion assays, human RBCs were washed in
wash media (RPMI supplemented with 25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) and treated
with decreasing amounts of neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (100, 50,
25, 12.5, 6.25 and 3.125 U; New England Biolabs) at 37 �C with gentle mixing for
30 min. The neuraminidase-treated RBCs were then washed extensively in
complete RPMI before use. The neuraminidase-treated RBCs were subjected to a
second neuraminidase treatment to remove and quantify the remaining sialic acid.
This second treatment was performed at 250 U neuraminidase at 50% haematocrit
for 30 min at 37 �C in PBS pH 6.0.
Invasion assays. For invasion assays using RBCs and cRBCs, cells were washed in
complete RPMI and counted on a haemocytometer. Cells (1.5 � 106) were added to
respective wells of a half-area 96-well plate at 0.5% haematocrit in triplicate.
Synchronised schizont-stage parasites were purified by magnetic separation on a
MACS cell separator (Miltenyi Biotec) and added to RBCs at B2% parasitaemia in
a final volume of 30 ml. Cells (2.5 � 105; 5 ml) were taken from each well for
cytospin preparations to assess initial parasitaemia by light microscopy. Assay
plates were kept in a modulator incubator chamber gassed with 1% O2, 5% CO2
and balance of N2, and reinvasion and growth were monitored over time by thin
smear of mock wells. At trophozoite/schizont stage, final parasitaemia was esti-
mated by light microscopy from counts of at least 1,000 cells on May-Gru
¨nwald-
and Giemsa-stained cytospins. The parasitized erythrocyte multiplication rate
(final parasitaemia (after single round of invasion)/initial parasitaemia) was
determined for each strain in each cell type. The Student’s unpaired t-test
(two-tailed) was used to assess significant differences in invasion.
For invasion assays with neuraminidase-treated RBCs, parasite invasion into
neuraminidase-treated RBCs was measured by SYBR Green I (Life Technologies)
staining and flow cytometry as described previously64, with several modifications.
Synchronised schizont-stage parasites at B10% parasitaemia that had been treated
with 250 U C. perfringens neuraminidase at ring stage to reduce reinvasion, were
washed, and then mixed with untreated and neuraminidase-treated target cells.
Invasion assays were seeded in triplicate 200 ml samples at B1% parasitaemia at 0.5%
haematocrit in a 96-well plate. To quantify inoculum parasitaemia, a subset of
samples was fixed immediately with formaldehyde and stored at 4 �C. The remaining
samples were incubated for 48h, then fixed for 1 h. Inoculum and post-invasion
samples were then stained with SYBR Green I and analysed by flow cytometry.
Expansion rates were expressed as parasitized erythrocyte multiplication rate.
For MGSA invasion inhibition assays, human RBCs were plated in a 96-well
plate at 4% haematocrit in 2 � complete RPMI (complete RPMI with twice the
amount of AlbuMAX II and sodium bicarbonate). MGSA (PeproTech) of varying
concentrations made up in incomplete RPMI were added to respective wells.
Schizont-stage parasites purified by magnetic separation, as described above, were
added to each well at B1% parasitaemia. After allowing for a single round of
invasion, parasitaemia was measured the following day by either SYBR green I or
Vybrant DyeCycle Violet (Life Technologies) staining and flow cytometry. The
parasitaemia of MGSA-treated samples was normalized to a mock-treated control
for each strain. The data were analysed in GraphPad Prism 5.
Protein expression plasmids. Region II of PkDBPa (gene ID: PkH_062300) and
Region II of PkDBPb (gene ID: PkH_000490) were amplified from P. knowlesi H
genomic DNA, while Region II of PkDBPg (gene ID: PkH_134580) was amplified
from a P. knowlesi fosmid obtained from a P. knowlesi fosmid library65, using
primers listed in Supplementary Table 3. PCR products were cloned into the
mammalian expression vector, pSDP32, a version of pTT66 with a modified
multiple cloning site and with the rat COMP domain downstream of the multiple
cloning site. For the GST-COMP-expressing plasmid, GST was amplified from
pET-42a( þ ) (Supplementary Table 3) and cloned into pSDP32. For the COMP-
negative control plasmid, NheI- and NotI-digested pSDP32 was modified with T4
DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) to generate blunt ends and then ligated.
Plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing.
HEK293-6E culture and protein expression and purification. HEK293-6E cells,
a kind gift from Yves Durocher (National Research Council, Canada), were
maintained in serum-free Freestyle 293 expression media (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 0.1% Pluronic F-68 (Life Technologies) and 25 mg ml � 1
Geneticin (Life Technologies). Cells were grown in suspension in Erlenmeyer flasks
at 110 r.p.m., at 37 �C in 8% CO2. Recombinant protein expression by transient
transfection was achieved as described66 with some modifications. In brief, cells
were transfected at a cell density of 1 � 106 cells per ml using 1 mg of plasmid DNA
per 1 � 106 cells and a DNA:polyethylenimine (PEI) ratio of 1:3 (w/w). DNA and
the transfection reagent, linear PEI (Polysciences, Inc.), were diluted separately in
complete Freestyle 293 media. The DNA was vortexed for 10 min, and DNA and
PEI were combined, vortexed for 30 s, allowed to incubate at room temperature for
12 min and finally added to the cell culture. Between 24 and 48 h post transfection,
a solution of Tryptone-N1 (Organotechnie SAS) was added to the transfected cell
culture at 0.5% (w/v). Cultures were processed on day 5 or 6 post transfection by
pelleting and collecting the culture supernatant containing the expressed protein.
Protein expression was confirmed by western blot using Strep-Tactin-HRP (IBA).
Culture supernatant containing recombinant protein was used in protein overlay
assays. For flow cytometry-based-binding assays, PkDBPb, PkDBPg and COMP
protein were affinity-purified from culture supernatant on a StrepTactin sepharose
column (StrepTrap HP; GE Healthcare) using an A
¨KTAFPLC Fast Protein Liquid
Chromatography system (GE Healthcare). Bound protein was eluted by 2.5 mM
desthiobiotin (Sigma-Aldrich). Buffer exchange into PBS pH 7.4 was achieved
using centrifugal filter units. Protein concentration was determined from
absorbance measurements at 280 nm and the protein-specific extinction coefficient.
Western blot analyses. HEK293-6E culture supernatant, RBCs or RBC ghosts
were electrophoresed on 4–15% gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane. Membranes were blocked in PBS–0.05% Tween (PBST)–10% milk (for
probing with Strep-Tactin-HRP), tris-buffered saline–0.1% Tween–0.5% Neu5Gc-
free blocking agent (for probing with anti-Neu5Gc) or PBST–5% milk (for probing
with anti-DARC; Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were probed with the respective
antibodies at the indicated dilutions—anti-DARC: 1:1,000 in blocking buffer, anti-
Neu5Gc: 1:10,000 in blocking buffer and Strep-Tactin-HRP: 1:2,500 in PBST–
20 mg ml � 1 avidin (PBST-A) after pre-incubation in PBST-A for 10 min. The
DARC western blot was probed with anti-rabbit-HRP (GE Healthcare) at 1:10,000,
while the Neu5Gc western blot was probed with anti-chicken/turkey-HRP (Life
Technologies) at 1:5,000 in blocking buffer. All membranes were developed with
SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific) and
imaged by autoradiography.
Protein overlay assay. Untreated and enzyme-treated rhesus macaque, and human
RBC ghosts and cRBC ghosts were prepared by cell lysis, and multiple washes in cold
5 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0. Protein content of macaque and human RBC
ghosts was quantified by Bradford assay. RBC/cRBC ghosts were stored at � 80�C
until use. Before use, cRBC ghosts were treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs).
Samples of enzyme-treated or untreated macaque and human RBC ghosts or cRBC
ghosts, not treated with reducing agent or heat-denatured, were electrophoresed;
10mg of macaque or human RBC ghosts (corresponding to B3 � 107 cells) were
loaded per lane, while cRBC ghosts made from B1.7 � 106 cells were loaded per
lane. Electrophoresed protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Mem-
branes were blocked in PBST-10% milk for 2 h at room temperature and then
washed in PBST. HEK293-6E culture supernatant containing recombinant protein
with Tween 20 added to a final concentration of 0.1% was added to membranes and
incubated overnight at 4 �C with gentle rotation. Membranes were washed, blocked
in PBST-A for 10 min, incubated in Strep-Tactin-HRP at a dilution of 1:2,500 in
PBST-A for 1 h at room temperature and finally developed with Pico substrate.
Bound protein was detected by autoradiography.
Flow cytometry-based binding assay. RBCs or cRBCs were washed three times
in PBS–0.5% Neu5Gc-free blocking buffer. Cells were pelleted in a 96-well plate at
3 � 105 RBCs per well and resuspended in either 50 ml blocking buffer or PkDBPb-
COMP, PkDBPg-COMP or COMP protein diluted in blocking buffer at the
appropriate concentrations. Samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature,
washed three times in blocking buffer and incubated in a monoclonal anti-strepII-
tag antibody (IBA) at 2 mg ml � 1 for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were washed
three times in blocking buffer then incubated in anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 488
antibody for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were washed twice, then
resuspended in 100 ml PBS for analysis on the MACSQuant flow cytometer. Data
were analysed by FlowJo 4 version 10.0.7.

 Whole-genome sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted from schizont-stage
Pk H and Pk YH1 parasites using the QIAamp DNA blood kit (Qiagen). Genomic
DNA was used to construct Illumina sequencing libraries for both P. knowlesi
strains, with a library insert size of 200 bp. Each library was sequenced to a depth of
at least 50-fold coverage using 101-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000
sequencer. Reads were aligned to the reference genome (P. knowlesi H, PlasmoDB
release 11) by applying the bwa mem algorithm from the Burrows–Wheeler
Aligner67 to the left and right read files using default settings. Alignments were
converted from SAM to BAM format, sorted and indexed using SAMtools68.
Coverage was calculated using the BEDtools genomeCoverageBed function69.
Whole-genome sequencing resulted in 23,386,393 reads for Pk H and
21,200,464 reads for Pk YH1. 95.05% of Pk H reads and 88.77% of Pk YH1 reads
mapped to the P. knowlesi reference genome. The average coverage depth for Pk H
was 89.43% and for Pk YH1 74.59%. These results represent a genome coverage of
99.86% for Pk H and 99.87 for Pk YH1.
