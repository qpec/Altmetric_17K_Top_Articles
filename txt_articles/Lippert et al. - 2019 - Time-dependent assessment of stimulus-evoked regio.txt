To date, the spatiotemporal release of specific neurotransmitters at physiological levels in the
human brain cannot be detected. Here, we present a method that relates minute-by-minute
fluctuations of the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [11C]raclopride directly
to subsecond dopamine release events. We show theoretically that synaptic dopamine
release induces low frequency temporal variations of extrasynaptic extracellular dopamine
levels, at time scales of one minute, that can evoke detectable temporal variations in the [11C]
raclopride signal. Hence, dopaminergic activity can be monitored via temporal fluctuations in
the [11C]raclopride PET signal. We validate this theory using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry
and [11C]raclopride PET in mice during chemogenetic activation of dopaminergic neurons.
We then apply the method to data from human subjects given a palatable milkshake and
discover immediate and—for the first time—delayed food-induced dopamine release. This
method enables time-dependent regional monitoring of stimulus-evoked dopamine release at
physiological levels.

 T
he neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) plays a key role in the
control of motor function, motivation, food intake, and
reward1–3. Malfunctions in the dopaminergic system cause
severe symptoms and debilitating diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s dis-
ease)4,5. The dopaminergic system is one of the most extensively
studied neurotransmitter systems, nevertheless, it is still far from
being fully understood. One reason originates from the basic
properties of neurotransmitter signaling: in response to percep-
tion of macroscopic stimuli, such as sensory cues, molecules are
released into synapses, only 20–30 nm broad, bind within milli-
seconds to intrasynaptic receptors, diffuse into extracellular space
and bind to extrasynaptic receptors, trigger secondary processes,
and eventually cause changes in macroscopic behavior. The whole
cascade of signal transduction from stimulus to behavior includes
a vast range of temporal and spatial scales but the available
methods for the analysis of the processes can only address sin-
gular aspects of these complex events.
Using positron emission tomography (PET) and the radio-
tracer [11C]raclopride, we introduce here a method for the
in vivo assessment of time-dependent regional dopamine release
that makes use of the relation between different time scales in the
dopaminergic system and that is—as we also demonstrate here—
readily applicable to humans. [11C]raclopride is a well-known
antagonist for dopamine type 2 receptors (D2Rs) and to lesser
extent dopamine type 3 receptors6. Due to its relatively low
binding affinity, it has, to date, been predominantly used for the
quantitative steady-state assessment of available D2R binding
sites in the striatum, the brain region with the highest density of
D2Rs. [11C]raclopride competes with endogenous DA for bind-
ing to D2Rs and therefore binding events depend on extracellular
concentrations of DA. The release of DA, and subsequent binding
to the D2R, reduces the amount of free D2Rs available for [11C]
raclopride interaction and thereby reduces the amount of bound
[11C]raclopride7. Based on this principle, several models have
been developed that relate task-induced or pharmacological
reductions of [11C]raclopride binding to DA release7–17. How-
ever, given the relatively slow kinetic rate constants of [11C]
raclopride, these methods require substantial, pharmacologically
enhanced, and long-lasting DA release events. Changes in [11C]
raclopride binding are thought to be insensitive to high-frequency
transient DA variations.
Here, we propose and validate a novel approach for the ana-
lysis of [11C]raclopride data based on theoretically derived pre-
dictions of the spatial and temporal consequences of DA release
events. We first demonstrate, with the help of a simple model
based on fundamental principles, how low-frequency variations
of extracellular DA concentrations can be directly linked to
synaptic DA release. We then extrapolate how temporal varia-
tions of extracellular DA concentrations induce temporal varia-
tions of [11C]raclopride binding and derive a parameter that
captures temporal variations of the [11C]raclopride signal and
can therefore be used as an indirect measure for regional DA
dynamics.
To support our theory, we performed [11C]raclopride PET in
mice that carry the chemogenetically activatable modified mus-
carinic receptor (hM3DGq) exclusively in DA neurons. We then
compared these [11C]raclopride PET data with sub-second
recordings of DA concentrations in the ventral striatum mea-
sured in situ using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). We
demonstrate that (i) chemogenetic activation of DA neurons in
mice increases the rate of spontaneous DA transients detected by
FSCV and that (ii) the number of transients is significantly cor-
related with the logarithm of the power in the frequency band of
0.5 Hz, as calculated by wavelet transform of continuously
recorded FSCV data. We further show that (iii) the logarithm of
high-frequency power (~0.5 Hz) and transient rates correlate
significantly with the logarithm of low-frequency power (~0.01
Hz) and that (iv) these low-frequency variations of extracellular
DA concentrations cause detectable variations in the [11C]
raclopride PET signal. With the mouse data supporting our
theory we conclude that temporal variations of the [11C]raclo-
pride PET signal can be used as a measure of dopaminergic
activity.
Finally, we applied our method to healthy human volunteers
who received a palatable milkshake during [11C]raclopride PET
data acquisition and identified acute and delayed stimulus-related
DA release in multiple striatal and extrastriatal brain regions.
Results
Low-frequency
variations
of
extracellular
DA.
During
a
synaptic release event, DA concentrations are elevated 104-fold
within the synaptic cleft for ~1 millisecond18 (Fig. 1a). Synapses
are not leak-proof and due to the high concentration gradient at
the border of the synapses part of the released DA diffuses into
extracellular space19. These changes in extracellular DA con-
centrations generate the signals detected by FSCV that show
stimulus-related transient 10–100-fold increases of extracellular
DA levels that last for ~2 s (Fig. 1b). Indeed, shape, magnitude,
and duration of FSCV transients can be precisely modeled as
integrated DA from synapses surrounding the probe leaking into
extracellular space. The extracellular DA concentration De is then
given by18:

Vs is the Volume of the synapse, Cs the DA concentration within
the synapse, D the apparent diffusion coefficient, α the fraction of
extracellular volume, and ls the fraction of synaptic leakage or
spillover (typical values for the striatum: Vs = 0.02 µm3, Cs = 0.8
mmol/L, D = 7.63e−6 cm2/s, α = 0.21, ls = 0.01)18,19. Note that
Equation (1) strictly applies to dopamine diffusion in the extra-
cellular space outside the synapse. Within the synapse the narrow
space confined by pre- and postsynaptic membranes and the high
density of transporters and receptors would require a mathema-
tical description different from Equation (1). However, Equation
(1) successfully describes the dopamine concentrations in the
extracellular space observed after phasic release. The fraction, ls,
that was able to diffuse out of the synapse, and not the total
amount of DA released, should then be inserted into Equation
(1). The model includes DA diffusion from the synapses at
locations, ri, and removal from extracellular space by DA trans-
porters (DATs) with an effective removal rate constant of k
reflecting the local density of DATs. Reported values range from
k = 0.01 s−1 to 20 s−1 corresponding to effective lifetimes of 100
to 0.05 s18,20. The summation is over all synapses, i, and release
times, j, with ti,j being the times of DA release of a synapse at
location ri. See Fig. 2 for DA concentration at the location of an
FSCV probe as a function of time after synaptic DA release cal-
culated from Equation 1 assuming that the probe receives input
from a fast domain with a high density of DATs (k = 2 s−1) and a
slow domain with a low density of DATs (k = 0.02 s−1). The
absolute rate of removal in each domain is given by the product
of removal rate constant and extracellular DA concentration
(−kDe). This means that, depending on the local density of
DATs, net changes of extracellular DA concentrations occur at
time scales of minutes to seconds and the amplitude of these
changes (dDe(r,t)/dt) is proportional to extracellular DA con-
centration (De(r,t)) which, by its origin, is directly proportional to
synaptic DA release. Thus, the amplitude of low-frequency

 variations of extracellular DA concentrations is directly propor-
tional to (and is therefore a potential measure of) synaptic DA
activity (Fig. 1a–c, Fig. 2).
Variations of extracellular DA cause PET signal variations.
After intravenous injection, [11C]raclopride is transported to the
brain, where blood and brain concentrations in the extracellular
fluid equilibrate. Within the brain, [11C]raclopride diffuses
through extracellular space which effectively consists of two
compartments:
the
extracellular
extrasynaptic
compartment
covering the fractional volume ve (referred to as ECS) and the
synaptic compartment covering the fractional volume vs. Within
each compartment [11C]raclopride binds to D2R according to its
binding affinity which leads to the reaction pathway illustrated in
Fig. 1d.
Endogenous DA, released into synapses or directly into the
ECS, partially occupies the same compartments as [11C]
raclopride. Diffusion of DA between synapses and ECS causes
variations of DA concentration in the ECS even in the absence of
direct DA release into the ECS. DATs transport DA from ECS
and synapses back into the cells (dec and dsc in Fig. 1d). In the
following model, we only take into account DA binding to D2Rs
omitting other receptor types due to the specific competition with
[11C]raclopride binding. As illustrated in Fig. 1d, DA and [11C]
raclopride both occupy ECS and synapses and compete for
binding to D2R within these compartments.
The effective binding rates of [11C]raclopride (reb) and DA
(deb) to D2R in the ECS depend on the amount of unbound D2R:

Fig. 1 DA release causes spatiotemporal variations of DA concentrations on multiple scales. a DA release increases synaptic DA concentrations by a factor
of ~10,000 for ~1 ms. b Diffusion-driven outflow of DA from synapses increases DA concentration 10–100-fold in the close vicinity of synapses for ~2 s.
These transients can be directly measured using FSCV. c DA is cleared from extracellular space by dopamine transporters (DAT). The time scale for
clearance depends on the local DAT density. In a volume of 1 µL part of the DA from synaptic release diffuses into regions with low DAT density and
accordingly slow clearance rates of ~1 min. In the extracellular space DA competes with [11C]raclopride for binding to D2 receptors. Unbound [11C]
raclopride concentration is in equilibrium with [11C]raclopride concentration in the blood (vessel shown in dark red). d Synaptic and extracellular tissue
compartments are shared by DA and [11C]raclopride, DA is supplied from and cleared into axons (intracellular space), [11C]raclopride from the blood. DA
compartments are labeled with D, transfer rate constants with d, [11C]raclopride compartments with R and transfer rate constants with r. Subscripts are c:
intracellular space, p: plasma, s: synapse, e: extracellular (extrasynaptic) space, b: bound to D2 in ECS, sb: bound to D2 in synapse. e Effectively the [11C]
raclopride PET signal is determined by the ECS. Temporal variations of D2-bound extrasynaptic DA modulate the [11C]raclopride binding constant reb.
Reported kinetic rate constants according to Endres et al.21 and Farde et al.22. f Periodic changes of Db cause frequency-dependent periodic variations of the
[11C]raclopride PET signal that are proportional to the amplitude af of Db variations using kinetic rate constants from Farde et al. (green line) and from
Endres et al. (blue line). af can have values between 0 and 1, af = 1 means that DA occupies 100% of the D2 receptors. Only variations at low frequency are
detectable by PET. Extrastriatal variations were calculated assuming a D2R density of 5% of the striatal density

 Te is the total (bound plus unbound) amount of D2Rs located on
extrasynaptic cellular membranes and thereby accessible by DA
and [11C]raclopride in the ECS. Db and Rb are the concentrations
of bound DA and bound [11C]raclopride, respectively. reb,max and
deb,max are the maximum binding rates of [11C]raclopride and
DA when the total amount of D2R is available for binding. The
total [11C]raclopride concentration, R, in a certain volume is the
sum of all compartments:
R ¼ vPRP þ veðRe þ RbÞ þ vsðRs þ RsbÞ
ð4Þ
RP is the concentration of [11C]raclopride in plasma, Re the free
concentration in extracellular extrasynaptic space, Rs the free
concentration in the synapses, and Rsb, the concentration of
intrasynaptic bound [11C]raclopride. Since [11C]raclopride does
not diffuse into blood cells, the contribution of [11C]raclopride in
blood to the volume signal, R, is given by the product of plasma
volume fraction vP and plasma concentration RP. Given that the
free concentrations in tissue are equilibrated, i.e., Re = Rs and that
the amount of bound [11C]raclopride (Rb) is in the order of
magnitude of free [11C]raclopride, the contributions of the
synaptic [11C]raclopride to the volume signal can be neglected
due to the small volume of synapses relative to ECS volume19.
This leads to a simple two-tissue compartment model illustrated
in
Fig.
1e.

[Note that for DA, in contrast to [11C]raclopride, the contribu-
tion of the synaptic volume would not be negligible because DA
concentrations within synapses reach levels 3–4 orders of
magnitude higher than in the extracellular space.] Since the
[11C]raclopride signal effectively originates from the ECS, it is
influenced only by variations of DA binding in the ECS and not
in the synapse. For further simplification, we assume that the
fraction of D2Rs blocked by [11C]raclopride is negligible in
comparison to the total amount of D2Rs. If the amount of D2R-
bound DA in the ECS varies in time (Db(t)), the number of D2Rs
available to [11C]raclopride changes and the binding parameter
of [11C]raclopride (reb) varies in time by the factor fDA(t) = (1-
Db(t)/Te). The effective equations that describe [11C]raclopride
kinetics in tissue taking into account DA dynamics are then given

Fig. 2 Extracellular DA after synaptic release. a Calculated extracellular DA concentrations at the location of an FSCV electrode (black, solid) assuming that
the signal contains contributions from a fast domain (blue, dash-dot) with high density of DA transporters (DATs) and a slow domain (green, dashed) with
low density of DATs (Equation 1). DA is removed from the fast domain at a rate of s−1 and from the slow domain at a rate of min−1. Although the overall
FSCV signal in the striatum is dominated by the signal from the fast domain, the slow domain determines variations of extracellular DA concentration on a
minute-by-minute scale. The amplitudes of both, the fast and the slow domain, depend on synaptic DA release. b The peak amplitude of dopamine
transients in extrastriatal regions is lower due to the lower spatial density of DA synapses (green, dashed). All of the released DA is removed at minute
time scale due to the lower density of DATs in extrastriatal regions in comparison to the striatum. Consequently the amplitude of minute-by-minute
changes in extracellular DA concentration is the same in extrastriatal and striatal regions (black, solid). c Simultaneous FSCV recordings from the striatum
(CP) and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in rats after electrical stimulation of the VTA by Garris et al. support this theory42. In order to evoke a
detectable signal in the MPFC the VTA was stimulated at superphysiological amplitudes. d Combination of the CP and MPFC traces in a single graph
indicates that the tail representing slowly removed DA in the CP is of the same magnitude as the extrastriatal signal

If we further assume the contribution of [11C]raclopride in the
blood is negligible due to the small fractional volume of this
compartment (~3%), the total [11C]raclopride signal in a tissue
volume is R(t) = Re(t)+Rb(t). In order to estimate the impact of
temporal variations of DA on the detectable [11C]raclopride
signal we decompose fDA(t) as a sum of harmonic oscillations:

for
different
frequencies, f, and different amplitudes, af, and found the relation
between variations of R(t) and the frequency, f, of temporal
variations of DA shown in Fig. 1f. This relation informs us that,
for example, variations of Db/Te with a frequency of 0.25 Hz and
an amplitude of 1 (number of D2Rs bound to DA fluctuates from
0% to 100%) will cause negligible relative variations in ΔR(t)/R0.
Db/Te variations with the same amplitude but a frequency of 0.01
Hz induce in the striatum variations in ΔR(t)/R0 of 0.25 if we
adopt the [11C]raclopride kinetic parameters from Endres et al.
or 0.38 with the parameters taken from Farde et al.21,22. [11C]
raclopride variations scale linearly with the amplitude af of DA
variations, i.e., the term ΔR(t)/R0/af shown in Fig. 1f only depends
on the frequency, f, but is independent of the amplitude, af, of DA
variations. At an amplitude of 0.5 (number of D2R bound to DA
changes periodically from 25% to 75%) ΔR(t)/R0 are 0.125
(Endres et al.) or 0.19 (Farde et al.) at 0.01 Hz. The density of
D2Rs in extrastriatal regions is ~2%-8% of the striatal density23.
Accordingly, extrastriatal DA variations at an amplitude of 1
induce ΔR(t)/R0 at 0.01 Hz of ~0.08 (Fig. 1f).

In
summary,
by
utilizing
the
theoretical
considerations
referenced above, we determined that [11C]raclopride effectively
models dynamic variations of DA bound to D2Rs in the ECS at
frequencies below 0.05 Hz. The relative amplitude of regional
[11C]raclopride variations (ΔR(t)/R0) is directly proportional to
the amplitude, af, of variations of DA bound to D2R in the ECS.
ΔR(t)/R0 can be calculated directly from dynamic PET data as a
measure of DA release rates.
Dopaminergic activity in the ventral striatum of mice. In the
previous sections, we demonstrated theoretically that synaptic DA
activity is related to low frequency (~0.01 Hz) variations of
extracellular DA which cause detectable temporal variations in
the [11C]raclopride PET signal. Here we substantiate the theo-
retical considerations with data from electrically stimulated wild-
type mice and a chemogenetic mouse model, in which dopami-
nergic
cells
express
a
modified
muscarinic
receptor
(hM3DGqDAT) activated by injection of an exogenous synthetic
compound, clozapine-n-oxide (CNO)24. After injection of CNO
hM3DGqDAT mice displayed behavioral changes indicative of
dopaminergic activation (Fig. 3; Supplementary Notes).
FSCV data were acquired continuously at a rate of 10 Hz in
wild-type mice, where transient DA release was induced by
electrical stimulation of the VTA, and in chemogenetically
activated
(hM3DGqDAT+CNO)
and
non-activated
mice
(hM3DGqDAT+Saline). With these data we show that (i)
chemogenetic activation of DA neurons increases the rate, but
not the magnitude, of spontaneous DA transients measured in the
ventral striatum, that (ii) the rate of transients—electrically or
chemogenetically induced—is correlated with high frequency
(~0.5 Hz) variations in DA levels extracted from the continuous
FSCV data, and that (iii) transient rates and high frequency
variations are correlated with low frequency variations (~0.01
Hz). We further show that (iv) chemogenetic activation of DA
neurons in the hM3DGqDAT mouse model increases temporal
variations in [11C]raclopride PET signal.
i. Activation of DA neurons increases rate of DA transients.
We first verified the electrode placement by examining changes in
DA levels in the nucleus accumbens evoked by electrical stimu-
lation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). There were no dif-
ferences in stimulated DA in the hM3DGqDAT+CNO or Saline-
treated animals prior to drug administration (main effect of
group: F(1,4) = 1.33, p = 0.31; group x treatment: F(4,16) = 1.68,
p = 0.20, Two-way ANOVA; note that one mouse of the
hM3DGqDAT CNO group was excluded from this analysis due to
a slightly different stimulation protocol). We then determined the
spontaneous dopamine transient rate in continuous FSCV data
recorded before and after CNO application by correlating the
recorded cyclic voltammograms with an evoked dopamine
“template” (Fig. 4a; see Methods section). Since transients are
directly linked to synaptic DA release, the number of transients
per time is a measure of dopaminergic activity. The rate of
transients was counted in one-minute intervals of FSCV data of
CNO- and Saline-treated hM3DGqDAT mice. Despite minor dif-
ferences in spontaneous activity in the first 5 min of baseline
recording, the results show a significant increase of the DA
transient rate following CNO-treatment that was not present in
the Saline-treated mice (main effect of treatment: F(1,5)1st hour =
14.31, p = 0.0129, F(1,5)2nd
hour = 6.99, p = 0.0458) (Fig. 4c).
Nonetheless, there was no consistent change in the size of the
release events in either group over the recording session com-
paring the pre-drug period with the 1st or 2nd hour after drug
administration (period x group interaction: F(2,8) = 0.946, p =
0.428, Two-way ANOVA; note one saline-treated mouse had no
transients in the pre-drug period so was excluded from this
analysis), although the transient size recorded in the CNO-treated
group was on average marginally higher throughout recording
(main effect of group: F(1,4) = 12.34, p = 0.025) (Fig. 4b).
Therefore, while CNO administration increased the transient rate

 or probability, it had little effect on the amplitude of each mea-
sured release event.
ii. DA transient rate correlates with DA variations at 0.5 Hz.
Next, to establish a link between high and low frequency varia-
tions of DA concentrations in the ECS and the rate of transients,
we extracted a continuous estimate of DA levels from the FSCV
signal (Fig. 4a; see Methods section) and decomposed this con-
tinuous signal into contributions from different frequencies by
performing a wavelet transform25. Figure 5 shows the trace of
FSCV data continuously recorded in the ventral striatum of a
single mouse (Fig. 5a) and the wavelet power spectrum calculated

 from this trace using a Gaussian mother function of order 3
(Fig. 5b, c).
The typical duration of DA transients in FSCV data is ~2 s
(Fig. 4b) causing an expected increase in the power spectrum at a
frequency of 0.5 Hz. We tested the relation of transient rates and
0.5 Hz wavelet power in wild-type mice where definite rates of
electrically stimulated DA transients were induced. Stimulations
were performed at rates of ten per minute or five per minute for
one-minute intervals followed by a four-minute (wt-mouse 1) or
a
nine-minute
interval
(wt-mouse
2,
3,
and
4)
without
stimulation. The logarithm of the 0.5 Hz wavelet power in each
one-minute interval was significantly correlated with the number
of transients induced during this interval (Pearson product
moment correlation: r = 0.89, p < 10–15) (Fig. 6).
In agreement with electrically induced DA release in wild-type
mice, transients counted in one-minute intervals in chemogen-
etically activated mice were significantly correlated with the
logarithm
of

dfCNO = 296,
tCNO = 14.26,
rSaline = 0.63,
pSaline<10–16,
dfSaline = 215,
tSaline = 11.75,
rcombined = 0.73,
pcombined<10–16, dfcombined = 513, tcombined = 24.44) (Fig. 7, Sup-
plementary Figure 1 and 2). This argues that the power at 0.5 Hz
in FSCV data, which can be calculated following a well-defined
standard procedure and does not require any thresholds or
assumptions on the shape of transients, can be used as a measure
of the transient rate. Consequently, activation of DA neurons in
mice increases not only the transient rate, but also the wavelet
power at 0.5 Hz.
iii. Transient rates and high and low-frequency variations.
Decomposition of continuous FSCV data into contributions from
different frequencies allows for correlation analysis between high-
frequency and low-frequency contributions, which we tested
between the logarithm of the FSCV wavelet power at 0.5 Hz
(referred to as “high”) and 0.01 Hz (referred to as “low”). In
electrically stimulated mice we found a significant correlation
between the logarithm of high and low frequency power (r = 0.55,
p = 0.00012; Fig. 6e) and also between transient rates and the
logarithm of low frequency power (transient rates vs. log(0.01 Hz
power), Pearson product moment correlation: r = 0.44, p =
0.0031).
Furthermore, with chemogenetically activated mice, transient
rates and the logarithm of high and low frequency wavelet power
correlated significantly within each group and in the combined
data (Pearson product moment correlation between logarithmic
power at 0.5 Hz and 0.01 Hz: rCNO = 0.13, pCNO = 0.030, dfCNO
= 296, tCNO = 2.19, rSaline = 0.14, pSaline = 0.042, dfSaline = 215,
tSaline = 2.05,
rcombined = 0.34,
pcombined<10–14,dfcombined = 513,
tcombined = 8.17; correlation between transient rates and logarith-
mic power at 0.01 Hz: rCNO = 0.15, pCNO = 0.008, dfCNO = 296,
tCNO = 2.69, rSaline = 0.16, pSaline = 0.016, dfSaline = 215, tSaline =
2.43, rcombined = 0.32, pcombined<10–12, dfcombined = 513, tcombined
= 7.63) (Fig. 5d, Fig. 8a–d). Consistently, activation of DA
neurons not only increased temporal fluctuations on a time scale
of one second (as measured by the high-frequency wavelet
power), but also systematically induced fluctuations at a minute
time scale (as measured by the low-frequency wavelet power).
iv. DA release increases temporal variations in PET signal.
[11C]raclopride PET emission data were acquired in the same
mouse
model
using
the
same
protocol
with
respect
to
hM3DGqDAT activation (Methods section). To rapidly reach a
steady state, [11C]raclopride was injected using a bolus + con-
stant infusion method11. Temporal variations in the [11C]raclo-
pride signal were calculated using Equation 10. Approximately 10
min after CNO injection a significant increase in the temporal
variations was observed in the striatum compared to vehicle-
injected mice (paired Student’s t-test, n = 6, t = 2.858, df = 5, p =
0.035) (Fig. 9a, b) with the left ventral striatum having the largest
change of temporal variations.
In summary, our data support the theoretically predicted link
between DA transient rates and variations of extracellular DA
concentrations at high (0.5 Hz) and low (0.01 Hz) frequency.
Activation of dopaminergic neurons significantly increases all
three components: the rate of DA transients and the power of
high and low frequency variations. This finding implies that all
three components are measures of in vivo DA activity. While the
detection of high frequency variations requires methods with high
temporal resolution data acquisition, low frequency variations
can be assessed with methods using lower temporal resolution. In
particular low frequency variations induce detectable variations in
the [11C]raclopride PET signal.
DA release in response to food intake in humans. By applica-
tion of our method to human subjects who received either
milkshake or a tasteless solution during the PET scan we found
significant differences at the time of supply in reward-related
regions of the DA system (ventral striatum (pFWE,cluster = 0.003),
habenula (pFWE,cluster = 0.0007), substantia nigra/VTA (pFWE,
cluster<0.0001), and pons (NTS; pFWE,cluster = 0.001 ; highlighted in
red in Fig. 10). Stimulation appears to induce detectable varia-
tions in the [11C]raclopride signal even in extrastriatal regions
although there is less [11C]raclopride binding. Traditionally in
PET analyses, data are integrated over time and each data point
includes the history of kinetics from tracer injection up to this
time point. In contrast, our method of analyzing signal variations
from one-time frame to the next provides variations of [11C]
raclopride as a function of time. Taking advantage of this aspect,
we found—apart from differences during the time of milkshake/
tasteless solution supply—a second-time interval with significant
differences in DA activity at 15–20 min post-stimulation (high-
lighted in green in Fig. 10a, b). Again the pons was part of this

an electrically-evoked dopamine template (bottom right panel). Spontaneous transients, identified as dopamine, are marked with a red asterisk; inset

 secondary delayed activation although at a different location
(pFWE,cluster<0.0001). Neighboring activation sites of the primary
activation, also ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus
(VPM; pFWE,cluster = 0.018) and the dorsal striatum (pFWE,cluster =
0.0003) showed delayed secondary response to the milkshake. In
rodents it was shown that vagus nerve-transmitted postingestive
signals can induce DA response in the brain and that vagal nerve
afferent terminals have D2 receptors26,27. This mechanism could
be the origin of the delayed DA activity that we observe in our
data. Note that in contrast to rDA the net [11C]raclopride uptake
in the corresponding regions did not show any significant dif-
ferences between milkshake and tasteless condition (Fig. 10c).
These results demonstrate the power of our new method for the
assessment of dopaminergic activity in humans. Further results of
the human study can be found here28.
Discussion
To date, two main approaches have been introduced to detect DA
release using PET. In the first approach, in baseline and stimu-
lated conditions, the binding potential of the PET tracer is
determined and differences are attributed to differences in
released DA7,12,29–33. In the second approach, the kinetic model
for the PET tracer was extended to account for dynamic changes
of endogenous DA concentrations thereby allowing for transient
DA release detection during PET data acquisition10,11,14,17,34.
However, both approaches have in common that they require
robust and long-lasting (> minute time scale) increases of DA
concentrations, for example by pharmacological intervention
prior to the PET measurement, to significantly reduce net
regional tracer binding, leading to detectable DA release events.
In our method, we analyze temporal fluctuations instead of net
reductions in regional tracer binding. The difference becomes
evident when we compare time activity curves (TACs), resulting
from net regional tracer binding, with rDA, calculated from the
temporal PET signal fluctuations using the method described
herein (Fig. 10a, c). Despite originating from the identical PET
dataset, only rDA reveals two distinct time intervals with
milkshake-induced activation, while the TACs do not indicate
any difference between tasteless and milkshake conditions. Since
the two approaches referenced above rely on net differences in the
TACs, neither would be capable of detecting DA release. Sup-
porting this observation, our FSCV data recorded in situ indicate
that phasic dopamine release induces minute-by-minute fluc-
tuations rather than minute-lasting elevations of DA concentra-
tions implying that temporal PET signal variations are far more
sensitive to detect DA release events than the net TAC. Thus, our
method, in comparison to the currently utilized non-invasive
detection methods, allows for the spatiotemporal assessment of
physiologically relevant DA release events.
rDA, calculated as the ratio of local variations to the absolute
local [11C]raclopride signal (Equation 10), is region-specific and
cannot be compared between different regions, e.g. double rDA in
the brain stem in comparison to the striatum does not mean that
DA release rates in the brain stem are higher than in the striatum.
But, as indicated by Fig. 1f, within a region rDA is proportional to
the amplitude of DA release and can therefore be compared
between subjects.
Our method for the detection of DA release is based on three
premises: first, the [11C]raclopride signal measured by PET

 is the reason that DA transients can be reliably detected by FSCV
although the electrodes cannot be positioned within the synaptic
cleft. The concept of diffusive loss of DA from synapses has been
elaborately discussed and is well established18. Moreover, minute
time scale removal rates are often present in FSCV transient
recordings – sometimes referred to as “hang-up”. As discussed by
A. Michael and colleagues “Evoked responses … with hang-up
are absolutely commonplace.”20,37 Although in vitro experiments
showed that part of the “hang-up” could be caused by adsorption
of DA molecules on the electrode surface and could thereby be a
methodological artifact, not all of the minute time scale
DA clearance rates observed in vivo can be explained by this
effect38–40. DA adsorption is related to exposure of the probe to
high DA concentrations: the higher the peak and duration of DA
concentration, the higher the DA adsorption. However, several
observations show minute time scale DA clearance rates without
the presence of a secondtime scale DA peak, which can accord-
ingly not be caused by adsorption41,42.
A potential mechanism that could explain the slow minute
time scale component in the FSCV data could be the hetero-
geneous subcellular distribution of DATs. A fraction of the
released DA diffuses into subcellular regions with low DAT
expression and accordingly slow removal rates (Figure 2).43,44 In
order to show that heterogeneous expression of DATs can cause
minute time scale DA clearance rates, we performed model cal-
culations that describe diffusion of DA through tissue with het-
erogeneous DAT expression. When we assumed homogenous
DAT expression our model provided identical results to Cragg
and Rice (Supplementary Figure 4A)19. Heterogeneous DAT
expression, however, produced prolonged DA clearance rates
(Supplementary Figure 4B). Furthermore, our calculations show
that the contribution of the minute time scale component of a
measured transient critically depends on the distance from the
release site. Further away from the release site the slow compo-
nent is more pronounced relative to the peak, while close to the
release site the contribution of the slow component appears
negligible relative to the peak in accordance with in vivo obser-
vations (Supplementary Figure 4C and D)41. Our model replicates
another aspect of these in vivo data: when we compare the minute
time scale component recorded close to the release site with that
recorded further distant, both are approximately identical (Sup-
plementary Figure 4D). The accordance of our model results with
in vivo observations indicates that transport and not diffusion
determine the minute time scale dynamics and—given that DAT
staining confirms the heterogeneous spatial distribution of
DATs44—that heterogeneous DAT expression could be a poten-
tial mechanism to explain the minute time scale removal rates.
Thus, the three prerequisites are in line with the current data on
dopaminergic signal transduction.
Although the density of D2Rs in extrastriatal regions is much
lower than in the striatum we were able to identify significant
extrastriatal DA release. Several aspects promote the sensitivity of
our method for detection of extrastriatal DA release. First, tem-
poral variations in the signal relative to the total signal were
analyzed instead of the absolute [11C]raclopride uptake, which
makes the method more sensitive for the detection of variations
in regions with low [11C]raclopride uptake. Second, although less
DA is released in extrastriatal regions due the lower density of DA
synapses, the major fraction of released DA is removed at a
minute time scale due to the lower density of DATs. Therefore,
the amplitudes of release-induced minute-by-minute variations in
extracellular DA concentrations are of the same order of mag-
nitude extrastriatally and in the striatum despite the difference in
total amount of released DA (Figure 2).42 A detailed discussion of
this topic can be found in the Supplementary Discussion.
We found with continuous FSCV recordings that CNO-treated
hM3DGqDAT mice increased the rate of transients – although a
low rate of spontaneous transients was detectable in non-
activated mice. Typically, FSCV is applied to recording of tran-
sient phasic neurotransmitter release that is time-locked to direct
stimulation of an upstream brain region or to a release-inducing
behavioral task41,45,46. With continuous recording, spontaneous
transients were identified by application of a DA template.
Interestingly, we could show that wavelet power at 0.5 Hz
strongly correlates with the transient rate. This means that
transient rates can be derived from continuous FSCV data by
application of a wavelet transform, which, in contrast to template
application, does not require any assumptions or thresholds and

 can therefore be applied more easily. Thus, wavelet transform is a
powerful tool to extract changes of DA levels from continuous
FSCV data.
Moreover, we found correlations between high and low-
frequency wavelet power within the continuous data indicating
that minute-by-minute DA levels might be causally linked to
second-by-second levels. This finding agrees with another
experimental FSCV study where DA levels were continuously
recorded in the nucleus accumbens. The authors conclude that
extracellular DA largely arises from phasic DA release47. The
causal link between minute-by-minute and second-by-second DA
levels potentially challenges functional segregation of the two
processes: If minute-by-minute levels are just a consequence of
second-by-second release, evoked functions are presumably
related to each other. In other words: if phasic DA release
determines the tonic DA level, the functional consequences of
both might also be related48. (For further discussion see Berke49).
The relation of synaptic release and low-frequency variations of
extracellular concentrations is based on fundamental principles
(diffusion, transport)18 and should theoretically not be limited to
dopamine but should also apply to other neurotransmitters.
However, whether conditions are suitable (signal to noise ratio,
life time, etc.) to produce detectable signals of neurotransmitter
activity, will have to be evaluated individually for each neuro-
transmitter system. Nevertheless, the method provided here not
only opens novel avenues to study temporal and local dynamics
of dopaminergic transmission in human, but potentially for a
whole range of other neurotransmitters
Methods
Ethical approval. All animal procedures were conducted in compliance with
protocols approved by local governmental authorities (Bezirksregierung Köln) and
were also in accordance with NIH guidelines for animal research. FSCV experi-
ments were conducted under the auspices of the UK Home Office laws for the
treatment of animals under scientific procedures and of the University of Oxford
ethical review board.
All subjects included in the human PET study gave written informed consent
prior to study, which was approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical
Faculty of the University of Cologne (Cologne, Germany).
Genetic mouse models. The Rosa26CAGSloxSTOPloxhM3DGq and dopamine
transporter-Cre recombinase (DAT-Cre) expressing mice are described else-
where50,51. All animal lines were maintained on C57BL/6N backgrounds. To
generate the experimental model, homozygous Rosa26CAGSloxSTOPloxhM3DGq
(hM3DGq) females were crossed to DAT-Cre males, to generate mice with het-
erozygous expression of the hM3DGq specifically in dopamine neurons. Non-
transgenic littermate controls were used in the behavioral experiments (referred to
as hM3DGqWT). In all other experiments Cre positive animals were used (referred
to as hM3DGqDAT). Mice were housed at 22 °C-24 °C with a 12 h light/12 h dark
cycle. Animals had ad libitum access to food and water in the home cage at all
times. All experiments were performed in adult male mice (age: 13–37 weeks, body
weight: 24.6–47.9 g).
CNO administration. Clozapine-n-oxide (CNO) was purchased from Sigma (Cat.
No. C0832–5MG). A 5 mg/mL stock solution was made using DMSO (Sigma). 32
µL aliquots were stored at −20 °C, and on individual test days, a working solution
of 0.03 mg/mL was generated using sterile saline (0.9%; Aquapharm). All injections
were made intraperitoneally. Sterile Saline was used for vehicle injection in all
experiments unless otherwise stated. The vehicle control consisted of 0.6% DMSO
in saline.

 Open field test. hM3DGqDAT and hM3DGqWT mice were acclimated for 5 days to
daily injections prior to the test day. On the test day, animals received an injection
of CNO (0.3 mg/kg, Sigma) or sterile saline (10 µl/g BW) and were placed
immediately into open field chambers (27.3 cm × 27.3 cm × 20.3 cm; Med
Associates, VT). The animals were monitored for 120 min in the chambers using
infrared beam breaks in the X, Y and Z planes and data was collected in 10-minute
bins. Post analysis of locomotor and rotational behaviors were assessed using
MedActivity Software (Med Associates, VT).
Electrode implantation surgery. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (3–4%
for induction and 1.0–1.5 % for maintenance) and given 5 mg/kg meloxicam
(Metacam) and 0.7 ml glucosesaline (0.5 % in 0.9 % saline; Aquapharm) sub-
cutaneously (note, no opioid analgesic was given to avoid any potential interactions
with dopamine systems). After induction, the head was shaved and secured in a
stereotaxic frame. Body temperature was maintained at 36–37 °C with the use of a
homeothermic heating blanket. Corneal dehydration was prevented with applica-
tion of ophthalmic ointment (Lacri-Lube, Allergan, UK). The head was then
cleaned with dilute Hibiscrub and Reprochem (diluted 1:20 in water), and a local
anesthetic, bupivacaine (2 mg/kg; AstraZeneca), was administered under the scalp.
The skull was then exposed and holes were drilled for an Ag/AgCl reference
electrode, an anchoring screw, a recording electrode and a stimulating electrode.
After the reference electrode was secured in place using dental cement (Kemdent,
Swindon, UK), a custom-made carbon fiber microelectrode was attached to a
voltammetric amplifier and lowered toward the dorsal nucleus accumbens (NAc)
core (AP: +1.4, ML: 0.75, DV: −3.5 to −4.25 from skull) followed by a 2-channel
untwisted stimulating electrode (PlasticsOne) to the ipsilateral ventral tegmental
area (VTA) (AP: −3.5, ML: 0.35, DV: −4.0 to −4.55 from brain), and the recording
process commenced (see below). The reference electrode and anchoring screw were
positioned contralateral to the carbon fiber and stimulating electrodes. The mouse
was given additional boluses of 0.7 ml glucosesaline ~every 3 h for the rest of the
surgery.
Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry recordings. Recordings of in vivo nucleus
accumbens (NAc) core dopamine levels were made under anesthesia using FSCV.
The potential applied to the carbon fiber was ramped from −0.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl) to
+1.3 V and back at a rate of 400 V/s during a voltammetric scan and held at −0.4
V between scans. This happened at a frequency of 60 Hz for an initial 20-minute
period in order to condition the electrode, after which scan rate was reduced to 10
Hz for the rest of the experiment and dopamine detection commenced. Electrical
stimulation was applied using an isolated current stimulator (DS3, Digitimer).
Stimuli were generated and recordings collected using Tarheel CV (National
Instruments). The positions of the recording and stimulating electrodes were
optimized by moving them to find the maximal changes in dopamine that could
be detected after stimulation (50 × 2 ms monophasic pulses, 200 μA current, at
50 Hz).
Once this was achieved, the main experiment was started to determine the effect
of chemogenetic activation of dopamine neurons on patterns of NAc core
dopamine release. This consisted of two situations: (1) monitoring spontaneous
changes in dopamine levels in the absence of external stimulation, and (2)
examining evoked dopamine release after electrical stimulation of the VTA. For the
latter, we used 5 different stimulation parameters (2 recordings with each, 3 min
between stimulations): (i) 20 pulses 100 μA, (ii) 30 pulses 100 μA, (iii) 30 pulses
150 μA, (iv) 40 pulses 150 μA, and (v) 50 pulses 200 μA. This was performed 3
times: before mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of either CNO (0.3 mg/
kg body weight) or vehicle (0.6% DMSO in sterile saline), 1 h after injection, and at
the end of the experiment (~145 min after injection). For the middle set of
stimulations, only parameters (ii), (iv) and (v) were used. With the exception of the
first mouse that had a slightly different set of stimulation parameters the protocol
described was used for all mice.
To examine spontaneous changes in dopamine, we continuously monitored
dopamine levels under anesthesia, first for 10 min prior to injection of either CNO
or vehicle, then for 60 min after injection, and then finally for a further 60 min after
the middle set of electrical stimulations.
Additional continuous FSCV recordings were performed in the ventral striatum
of four wild-type mice. In one-minute time intervals DA release was induced by
electrical stimulation of the VTA at a rate of either 5 or 10 transients per minute
followed by a resting time interval of either 4 min (mouse 1) or 9 min (mouse 2, 3,
and 4). The parameters of the electrical stimulation were adjusted to 50 Hz, 4–7
pulses, and 100–200 µA in order to obtain transients with an average amplitude of
~1–2 nA. Recordings of mouse 3 and 4 displayed periods where the chemometric
model failed. Affected time intervals were excluded from the analysis. Note, that all
reported significances remain significant if these intervals are included in the
analysis.
Voltammetry data analysis. Voltammetric analysis was carried out using custom-
written scripts in Matlab. All data were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. In order to
characterize the rate of spontaneous dopamine transients in each mouse, we first
subtracted the average current recorded between 1.5–0.5 s before the target cyclic
voltammogram to account for large changes in capacitance current. We then
looked for periods when the cyclic voltammograms recorded over the course of the
experiment correlated with a correlation coefficient of R ≥ 0.86 with a dopamine
“template” derived by electrically stimulating the VTA before the experiment began
(Daberkow, 2013; Cheer, 2004). The numbers of transients per minute before and
after either CNO or vehicle injections were then compared.
To extract an estimate of changes in dopamine levels over time across the
session, a principal component analysis was performed using a standard training
set of stimulated dopamine release detected by chronically implanted electrodes,
with dopamine treated as the first principal component among other unrelated
electrochemical fluctuations such as changes in pH. For this analysis, we divided
the data into non-overlapping 30 s bins and, for each, subtracted the average
current recorded over the initial 1 s in each bin. Given that it is only possible to
derive a relative and not an absolute measurement of dopamine levels using FSCV,
the extracted dopamine in each bin were combined by assuming that the first
recorded value in bin N+1 continued relative to the last time point in bin N.
Wavelet transform of continuous FSCV data. A wavelet transform decomposes
the signal into harmonic functions of different frequencies but in contrast to the
Fourier transform these harmonic functions have a finite duration. Thereby, a
wavelet transform does not lose the temporal information of the signal25. The
wavelet power calculated as the square of the wavelet coefficients gives the power in
variations of extracellular DA levels as a function of frequency and time.

 For the analysis of high and low-frequency variations in the FSCV data a
wavelet transform with a Gaussian mother function (3. order) was applied. Since
continuous data is needed for the wavelet transform missing points in the data
were interpolated. Using a cone of influence the wavelet data of these segments
were removed from the resulting spectra (t±2*1/f). Additionally, to avoid edge
effects the borders of the wavelet transform were also removed (tmin+4*1/f and
tmax−4*1/f). The power in the wavelet spectrum at 0.01 and 0.5 Hz was averaged in
windows of 1 min to yield time courses of wavelet power at 0.01 Hz and at 0.5 Hz
for each animal. Correlation analyses were restricted to time intervals that
contained continuous data in all three parameters (#transients/minute, wavelet
power at 0.01 Hz and at 0.5 Hz).
Synthesis of [11C]raclopride. [11C]-O-methylraclopride was prepared according
to Langer et al.52 with the following modifications: (1) 2–2.5 mg precursor des-
methylraclopride•HBr was used instead of free base, (2) 350 µl DMSO together
with 6 µl 5N NaOH was used instead of acetone as reaction solvent, (3) the reaction
mixture was heated at 80 °C for 4 min, (4) the eluent was removed after semi-
preparative HPLC separation by solid phase extraction with a Waters OASIS MCX
1cc cartridge, eluted with 500–700 µl ethanol 96%/NH3 (95:5) and 2 ml 0.9% NaCl
solution, and (5) formulation by adding another 6.5 ml 0.9% NaCl solution and 1
ml 125 mM sodium phosphate buffer, resulting in a solution with pH 5–7. The
specific activity at time of injection was 22.8 ± 9.0 GBq/µmol.
Mouse PET data acquisition. Dynamic PET data were acquired using a combined
preclinical PET/CT scanner (Inveon, Siemens). For each scan session of 60 min two
animals were placed on a water-heated mouse carrier with stereo-tactic holders
(Medres). During the procedure mice were anesthetized with ~2 % isoflurane
vaporized in 1.0 L/min of oxygen-nitrogen gas (30 % O2 / 70 % N2). At the start of
the PET data acquisition the animals received a bolus-plus-constant-infusion
injection of 10.5 ± 2.6 MBq of [11C]raclopride via the tail vein: a bolus of 80 µl
was injected in one minute, followed by additional 120 µl injected via constant
infusion until the end of data acquisition using programmable syringe pumps
(„Genie“ Kent, Kent Scientific Corp., Torrington, CT). 10 min after the start of the
PET scan the mice either received CNO (0.3 mg/kg body weight) or sterile saline
(10 µl/kg body weight) intraperitoneally. Each animal was measured twice in a
randomized order once receiving CNO and once saline. Following the PET scan
the animals were automatically moved into the CT gantry and a CT scan was
performed (180 projections/360°, 200 ms, 80 kV, 500 μA). CT data were used for
attenuation correction of the PET data and the CT image of the skull was used for
image co-registration.
Mouse PET data processing. PET data were histogrammed in 60 time frames of
1 min, Fourier rebinned and after correction for attenuation and decay, images
were reconstructed using the MAP-SP algorithm provided by the manufacturer.
The images were co-registered to a reference mouse brain CT by rigid body
transformation using the imaging software VINCI53. Parametric images were
calculated using Equation 10 (see detailed description below, procedures written in
IDL and C).
Using a 3D mouse atlas constructed from a 2D mouse brain atlas54, an
anatomical volume of interest (VOI) of the left striatum was drawn. This region
was analyzed since FSCV data were acquired from this region.

 Human PET. Although invasive methods such as FSCV have been applied to
measure task-related neurotransmitter release in the human brain55–57, PET
measurements are non-invasive and therefore much more readily translatable to
humans. In contrast to mice, human subjects do not require anesthesia during the
PET scan and natural non-pharmacological types of stimulation, such as food, can
be applied as a stimulus to induce DA release. In order to analyze food-related
reward signaling, we applied the method to healthy human volunteers who
received a milkshake during [11C]raclopride-PET data acquisition. Human sub-
jects (n = 10) were monitored in two different conditions: in one session they
received a palatable milkshake and in the other session a tasteless solution. Fol-
lowing the method introduced here, maps of DA activity were calculated in time
intervals of five minutes. Voxelwise statistical testing was performed (paired Stu-
dent’s t-test) between the two conditions to identify locations with stimulation-
induced changes in dopaminergic activity. Here we discuss only exemplary aspects
of that data as a proof of principle and to demonstrate the power of the new
approach. The full-length results of this study can be found here28.
Subjects were ten healthy, male, normal-weight (BMI: 25.73 ± 2.67, age:
57.1 ± 10.55) and non-smoking volunteers recruited from a preexisting database of
Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research. No history of neurological,
psychiatric or eating disorders were present. Further exclusion criteria were special
diets, lactose intolerance, diabetes, the participation in a previous PET study and a
score higher than 12 in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI II)58.
Human PET data acquisition. Two PET scans were performed in a randomized
order with the subjects receiving either milkshakes or a tasteless and non-nutritive
solution (potassium chloride/sodium bicarbonate) during the scan. A HRRT Sie-
mens PET gantry with a spatial resolution of ~2.5 mm FWHM was used. The head
of the subjects was fixed by an inflatable helmet to prevent motion during data
acquisition. Data for attenuation correction was acquired by performing a ten-
minute transmission scan using a rotating germanium-68/gallium-68 source.
Afterwards, [11C]raclopride injection started and emission data were acquired for
the following 60 min 70 % of the [11C]raclopride (220–370 MBq) was applied as
bolus within a minute and 30 % was constantly infused during the remaining 59
min using a programmable syringe pump (Perfusor compact, Braun, Melsungen).
The food stimulus started 20 min after the start of the data acquisition, when
steady-state conditions were reached, and lasted for 10 min During this time either
milkshake or tasteless solution was delivered to the tongue tip of the subjects via a
teflon mouthpiece that was attached to the gantry. For further details see ref. 28.
Human PET data processing. The acquired emission data were corrected for
attenuation and scatter. PET images were reconstructed in 12-time frames of 5 min
duration using three-dimensional ordinary Poisson ordered subset expectation
maximization (OP-3D-OSEM) including the modeling of the system's point spread
function (PSF). The resulting images were smoothed using a 10 mm Gaussian filter
using the imaging software VINCI53. The smoothed PET images were co-registered
to an additionally acquired individual anatomical T1-weighted scan by rigid body
transformation. The MR scans were normalized into the Montreal Neurological

Parameter for measuring temporal dynamics of [11C]raclopride. From the
[11C]raclopride PET images parametric maps were calculated. In the manuscript
we have shown that variations of the [11C]raclopride signal are related to varia-
tions of D2R-bound DA in the ECS. Part of the temporal variations in the [11C]
raclopride signal is due to noise. However, since the noise level does not abruptly
change during the measurement, short-term changes in the temporal variations are
presumably caused by changes in DA activity. Temporal variation of the [11C]
raclopride signal at time tn and location (image voxel) i,j,k can be calculated as:

In order to reduce noise in the parameter for temporal variations of the tissue
[11C]raclopride signal we here calculate the average of the absolute difference
between the signal at time tn and tn−1 in a region that includes the box i−di,i+di,j
−dj,j+dj,k−dk,k+dk. The square root term is a measure for ΔR(tn) the average
change from time tn−1 to time tn of the [11C]raclopride signal in the box centered
at i,j,k (Nsum is the number of voxels in the box). R0 is calculated in Equation 11 as
the average signal in the box after the quasi steady state has been reached at tns =
20 min after bolus injection. The size of d reduces the spatial resolution but also
reduces spatial noise in the parameter. The choice of d depends on the system used
for data acquisition and on the quality of the data. For mouse data acquired we
used di = dj = 2 and dk = 1 (asymmetric voxel size), for the human data we used di
= dj = dk = 2.
It is important that rDA = ΔR(t)/R0 is calculated from the square root of the
sum-of-squares and not just from the sum of differences (Equation 10). From
theory, the absolute value of temporal changes but not the direction of change
(increase or decrease) is a measure for DA activity.
ΔR(tn) is calculated from the difference in [11C]raclopride signal at time tn and
time tn−1 and therefore depends on the duration of time frames (Δt = tn−tn−1) of
the PET data. Although shorter time frames provide higher temporal resolution,
Fig. 1f indicates that shorter time frames (i.e. higher frequencies) are less sensitive
to variations of DA and apart from that include more noise inherent in the
measurement procedure. For the mouse data we used Δt = 1 min, for humans we
used Δt = 5 min
rDA is a measure for local temporal variations of the [11C]raclopride signal
(ΔR) relative to total local [11C]raclopride signal (R0). rDA is thereby a measure for
local DA activity and is thus comparable between subjects but it cannot be
compared between regions. Since D2R density in extrastriatal regions is lower than
in the striatum there is consequently less total [11C]raclopride binding. Higher
rDA in an extrastriatal region than in the striatum does not necessarily mean that
more DA was released in the extrastriatal region. But following the time course of
rDA within a region indicates temporal variations of DA activity.
Statistical testing. For behavioral studies, Three-Way ANOVA analysis of data
collected over time was conducted using JASP Version 0.8.3.1 (University of
Amsterdam), followed by Two-way ANOVA post-hoc analysis at individual time
points corrected for false discovery rate using GraphPad Prism version 7.0c for
Mac OS X, (GraphPad Software, California, USA, www.graphpad.com). Two-way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc analysis of locomotor behavior totals
and rotational behavior was performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.0c. P-
values<0.0.5 were considered significant. For FSCV analyses, Pearson product
moment correlations were calculated using R. For testing differences between
groups unpaired Student’s t-test was performed. P-values <0.05 were considered
significant. In mouse PET studies differences between activation and baseline were
determined by performing a paired Student’s t-test. P-values <0.05 were considered
significant. In the human PET study voxel-wise independent paired Student’s t-
tests of parametric images were performed between milkshake and tasteless scans
for each time frame. Clusters with statistically significant differences
(p-value <0.05) were corrected for multiple comparisons by calculating
family-wise error rates on cluster level59. All statistical tests in this work were two-
sided.
