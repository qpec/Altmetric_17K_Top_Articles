Contraception Study

BACKGROUND: Oral contraceptives have been used by hundreds of
millions of women around the world. Important questions remain regarding
the very long-term cancer risks that are associated with oral contraception.
Despite previous research, important questions remain about the safety of
these contraceptives: (1) How long do endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal
cancer benefits persist? (2) Does combined oral contraceptive use during
the reproductive years produce new cancer risks later in life? (3) What is
the overall balance of cancer among past users as they enter the later
stages of their lives?
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the very long-
term cancer risks or benefits associated with the use of combined oral
contraceptives, including the estimated overall life-time balance.
STUDY DESIGN: The 46,022 women who were recruited to the UK
Royal College ofGeneralPractitioners’ OralContraception Study in1968and
1969 were observed for up to 44 years. Directly standardized rates of
specific and any cancer were calculated for “ever” and “never” users of
combined oral contraceptives; data were standardized for age, parity, social
class, and smoking. Attributable risk and preventive fraction percentages
were calculated. Poisson regression that adjusted for the same variables
was used to estimate incidence rate ratios between ever and never users
and to examine effects by time since last oral contraceptive use.
RESULTS: There were 4661 ever users with at least 1 cancer during
884,895 woman-years of observation and 2341 never users with at
least 1 cancer during 388,505 woman-years of observation. Ever use of
oral contraceptives was associated with reduced colorectal (incidence
rate ratio, 0.81; 99% confidence interval, 0.66e0.99), endometrial
(incidence rate ratio, 0.66; 99% confidence interval, 0.48e0.89),
ovarian
(incidence
rate
ratio,
0.67;
99%
confidence
interval,
0.50e0.89), and lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer (incidence rate
ratio, 0.74; 99% confidence interval, 0.58e0.94). An increased risk of
lung cancer was seen only among ever users who smoked at recruit-
ment. An increased risk of breast and cervical cancer that was seen in
current and recent users appeared to be lost within approximately 5
years of stopping oral contraception, with no evidence of either cancer
recurring at increased risk in ever users with time. There was no evi-
dence of new cancer risks appearing later in life among women who
had used oral contraceptives. Thus, the overall balance of cancer risk
among past users of oral contraceptives was neutral with the increased
risks counterbalanced by the endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer
benefits that persist at least 30 years.
CONCLUSION: Most women who choose to use oral contraceptives do
not expose themselves to long-term cancer harms; instead, with some
cancers, many women benefit from important reductions of risk that
persist for many years after stopping.
Key words: cancer, cohort study, oral contraception
S
ince its introduction, first in the
United States in 1960,1 combined
oral contraceptives have been used by
hundreds of millions of women around
the world. Today, it is estimated that
100e150 million women use this con-
traceptive method on a daily basis.2
Concerns
were
expressed
early
on
about the method’s carcinogenic poten-
tial.1 Cancer was of particular concern,
given the likely high level of usage and
the 11e22% lifetime cancer risk among
women living in different parts of the
world.3 These concerns and frequent
media scares have left many women
wondering whether they have exposed
themsleves to long-term harm by using
this method of contraception.
There have been many, mostly case-
control, studies that have looked at
combined
oral
contraception
and
different types of cancer. Collectively,
the evidence suggests that current and
recent users of combined oral contra-
ceptives have an increased risk of breast
and cervical cancer and that long-term
users in regions at low risk of hepatitis
B virus may have an increased risk of
liver cancer.4 Conversely, users of com-
bined oral contraceptives appear to have
a reduced risk of endometrial and
ovarian cancer, which is an effect that
appears to persist for many years after
stopping. Current users of combined
oral contraceptives also appear to be
protected from colorectal cancer, with
uncertainty about the length of protec-
tion after stopping.
Even with this extensive body of evi-
dence important questions remain: (1)
How long do the endometrial, ovarian,
and colorectal cancers benefits persist?
(2) Does combined oral contraceptive
use during the reproductive years pro-
duce new cancer risks that emerge later
in life? (3) What is the overall balance of
cancer among past users of combined
oral contraceptives as they enter the later
stages of their lives? These questions are
best answered by large-scale, popula-
tion-based studies with the prospective
collection of exposure information and
very long-term follow-up. We report
here results from 44 years of follow up of

 the Royal College of General Practi-
tioners’ Oral Contraception Study, the
longest running study of the health ef-
fects of oral contraception in the world.
Materials and Methods
Between May 1968 and July 1969, 1400
general practitioners (GPs) throughout
the United Kingdom recruited approxi-
mately 23,000 women who were using
oral contraceptives and 23,000 women
who had never used this method of
contraception.5 All women were married
or co-habiting; most were white, and
their mean age at recruitment was 29
years. Information collected at recruit-
ment included previous use of oral
contraception, smoking habits, social
class (based on partner’s occupation ac-
cording to the Registrar General’s 1966
Classification of Occupations6), parity,
and significant medical history. Women
remained under GP follow up until (1)
they were no longer registered with the
recruiting doctor (usually because the
woman
moved
away;
approximately
56% of total cohort), (2) their doctor left
the study (13%), (3) they obtained
contraceptives
from
another
source
(3%), (4) they died (2%), or (5) GP
follow up stopped in December 1996
(26%). While under GP follow up,
GPs provided, on a 6-monthly report
form, information about any hormonal
preparations prescribed, any pregnan-
cies, new episodes of illness or surgery,
and cause of death. All GP-supplied
information was coded by a team of
trained clerks, with queries returned to
the
GPs
for
clarification
wherever
necessary.
In the mid 1970s, approximately
three-quarters of the cohort was “flag-
ged” at National Health Service central
registries in Scotland and England. This
enabled subsequent cancers and deaths
that occurred among flagged women to
be reported to the study anonymously,
including after women left GP follow up.
The other one-quarter could not be
flagged because the women already had
left the study when flagging occurred.
We used the GP-supplied data to
determine each woman’s pill status and
her contribution to the analysis. Most
women in the study (91%) who used oral
contraceptives did so before age 38 years.
Ever users were women who were
recruited as takers and subsequently
prescribed oral contraception (nearly
always a combined estrogen and pro-
gestogen preparation). For each calendar
month that a woman used an oral con-
traceptive, 1 month was added to the
period of observation (denominator) of
ever users, as were periods after stop-
ping. Women who were recruited as
never users who subsequently were pre-
scribed
an
oral
contraceptive
were
included in the ever user group from the
month of prescription. Never users who
were lost to GP follow up before 1996

 and were aged <38 years when lost
contributed data (as never users) up to
the point of their loss before being
censored because of uncertainty about
whether they subsequently used oral
contraceptives. Never users who were
lost to GP follow up before 1996 and
were aged �38 years when lost were
likely to remain never users and so
continued to make a contribution to the
never user group if flagged (otherwise
they were censored at this point). Never
users who were still in the study when
GP follow up stopped in 1996 were
deemed unlikely to change pill status and
remained in the analysis. For a small
number of ever users (2,690/28,983;
9.3%), we did not have a stop date
notified by the GP. For these women, we
assumed
oral
contraceptive
usage
stopped 1 year after the last recorded
prescription. The effect of this assump-
tion was to underestimate time slightly
since stopping if a woman used oral
contraception for <12 months after the
last recorded prescription and to over-
estimate it if used for a longer period.
The analysis included cancers and
periods of observation up to (1) the date
of first relevant cancer or the date that
the women left the study for all non-
flagged women and flagged never users
who were lost from the study before 1996
and aged <38 years when lost and (2) the
date of relevant cancer or December 31,
2012, for all flagged women still under
GP observation at December 1996, for
flagged never users who were lost before
1996 and aged �38 years when lost, and
for flagged ever users who were lost from
the study before 1996 (Figure 1). Most
cancers were notified through flagging
by the central registries (ie, 5467/7002
[78%] of all cancers).
The cancers were coded according to
the International Classification of Dis-
eases, 8th revision7 grouped into cate-
gories: esophagus and stomach (code
150-151), colon and rectum (153-154),
gallbladder and liver (155-156), pancreas
(157), lung (162), skin-melanoma (172),
skin-other (173), breast (174), invasive
cervix (180), endometrium (182), ovary
(183), bladder and kidney (188-189),
central nervous system and pituitary
(191 and 1943), thyroid (193), site
unknown (199), lymphatic and he-
matopoietic (200-208), other cancers
(any code between 140-209 not already
mentioned); and any cancer (140-209).
If a discrepancy in event type or date
occurred between GP and registry noti-
fication, clarification was sought from
the GP whenever possible. If this was not
possible, the GP-supplied information
was used, because this was likely to be
most accurate because it was often based
on hospital-supplied information.
Direct standardization was used to
estimate the rates of cancer among ever
and never users. The standardization
variables for the total study population
were age (<30, 30e39, 40e49, 50e59,
60e69, �70 years), parity (0, 1, 2, �3) at
the time of the event, smoking (0, 1e14,
�15 cigarettes daily), and social class
(nonmanual: social classes I-IIIa [pro-
fessional, managerial and technical, and
skilled non-manual occupations] and
students; manual: social classes IIIb-V
[skilled, partly-skilled manual occupa-
tions, and unskilled occupations] and
armed forces) at recruitment. Poisson
regression was used to estimate the
incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 99%
confidence interval (CI) for ever vs never
users for each of the cancer types,
adjusted for the same categories of age,
parity, smoking, and social class as
mentioned earlier. The exception was
when we stratified the data by a partic-
ular variable (eg, smoking habits at
recruitment), when we adjusted the IRRs
for the other 3 variables. We calculated
99% CIs to allow for the large number of
comparisons, which indicated statistical
significance at the 1% level.
We excluded women who were known
to have the cancer before recruitment
and events and periods of observation
related to pregnancy. Only first events in
each cancer category were included;

 subsequent periods of observation that
related to the same cancer were removed
from the denominator of analyses but
were included in analyses of other can-
cers (because the women remained at
risk of having another type of cancer).
The analysis of any cancer risk included
only the first cancer, with subsequent
observation censored. In all analyses,
women were censored at death. By the
end of the follow-up period, 7248 deaths
occurred: 3003 deaths in never users and
4245 deaths in ever users of oral
contraception.
Attributable risk was calculated by
subtracting cancer incidence in never
users from that in ever users. When the
IRR was <1, the preventive fraction
percentage was estimated (ie, the per-
centage of cancer reduction in ever users
that might be prevented by combined
oral contraception). When the IRR was
>1, the attributable risk percentage was
calculated (ie, the percentage of cancers
in ever users that might be attributable to
combined oral contraception).
For our time since last use analysis, we
divided the ever users into current and
<5 years since last use, 5 to <15 years
since last use, 15 to <25 years since last
use, 25 to <35 years since last use, and
�35 years since last use. We undertook
adjusted
Poisson
regression
as
mentioned earlier to estimate the IRR in
each category that was relative to never
users. Because of the strong relationship
between age and time since last use of
oral contraception, we did not undertake
standardization to obtain adjusted rates.
The study was established before the
introduction of research ethics com-
mittees in the United Kingdom. Even so,
procedures were used to maintain the
confidentiality of women (ie, corre-
spondence between participating doc-
tors and the study and between the
National Health Service central registries
and the study used a unique study
number, the key to which only the GPs
knew).
Results
The dataset contained 4661 ever users
with at least 1 cancer during 884,895

 woman-years of observation and 2341
never users with at least 1 cancer during
388,505 woman-years of observation,
which was an 81% increase in cancers
and an 18% increase in periods of
observation since our previous cancer
analysis.8 Approximately one-tenth of
never users who experienced cancer (246
women; 10.5%) and a similar propor-
tion of ever users (458 women; 9.8%)
had >1 type of cancer. The mean age of
women at December 2012 was 70.2
(standard deviation, 8.0) years and me-
dian cohort follow-up time was 40.7
years (interquartile range, 6.1e44.6). At
recruitment, oral contraceptive users
were slightly younger and more likely to
smoke or be of nonmanual class than
never
users,
but
of
similar
parity
(Table 1). The mean duration of pill use
was 3.66 (standard deviation, 3.5) years.
Compared with never users, ever users
of oral contraception had a statistically
nonsignificant 4% reduced risk of any
cancer (Table 2; IRR, 0.96; 99% CI,
0.90e1.03). The IRR for the most com-
mon cancer, breast cancer, was close to
unity (IRR, 1.04; 99% CI, 0.91e1.17).
There were reductions among ever users,
compared with never users, in colorectal
(IRR, 0.81; 99% CI, 0.66e0.99), endo-
metrial (IRR, 0.66; 99% CI, 0.48e0.89),
ovarian (IRR, 0.67; 99% CI, 0.50e0.89),
and lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer
(IRR, 0.74; 99% CI, 0.58e0.94). An
increased risk of lung cancer among all
ever users was not statistically significant
at the 1% level. When never and ever
users were stratified by smoking habits at
recruitment (Table 3), the IRR for lung
cancer among nonsmoking ever users
was 0.73 (99% CI, 0.42e1.26) and that
among smoking ever users was 1.34
(99% CI, 1.06e1.69).
In general, the IRRs resulted in
modest attributable risks (Table 2),
which indicated a low absolute risk (or
benefit) of any specific cancer. The pre-
ventive
fraction
percentages
suggest
(assuming that the associated IRRs
represent a true causal relationship) that
perhaps one-third of endometrial and
ovarian cancers and nearly one-fifth of
colorectal cancers that occur in ever
users might be prevented by combined
oral contraception.
In both contraceptive groups, the
incidence of any cancer increased with
age and smoking and was higher in the
manual social class group (Table 4).
Most of the IRRs in the age, smoking,
social class, and parity subgroups were
below unity, although none reached
statistical significance.
Table 5 shows the IRRs by time since
last use. Statistically significant increased
IRRs were observed among current and
recent (<5 years since stopping) users
for breast, cervcial, and any cancer,
which are associations that largely dis-
appeared by 5 to <15 years after stop-
ping.
There
was
no
evidence
of
important cancer risks that appeared
many years after stopping oral contra-
ception; indeed, the IRRs for several
cancer types (colorectal, breast, ovarian,
central nervous system and pituitary,
lympathic and hematopoietic, other, site
unknown,
and
any)
were
reduced
significantly �35 years after stopping.
Comment
Our results suggest that users of oral
contraceptives are protected from colo-
rectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancer
for many years after stopping, perhaps
for >35 years for colorectal and ovarian
cancer. An increased breast and cervical
cancer risk that is seen in current and
recent users appears to be lost within

 approximately 5 years of stopping oral
contraception, with no evidence of either
cancer recurring at increased risk in ever
users with time. An increased risk of lung
cancer was seen only in ever users who
were smokers at recruitment. There was
no
evidence
of
new
cancer
risks
appearing later in life among women
who had used oral contraceptives. These
results provide strong evidence that most
women do not expose themselves to
long-term cancer harm if they choose to
use oral contraception; indeed, many are
likely to be protected.
The large number of women recruited
and the very prolonged follow-up period
resulted in nearly 1.3 million women-
years of observation. The near doubling
of events since our last report enabled us
to provide separate risk estimates for
esophagus and stomach, pancreas, non-
melanoma skin, bladder and kidney,
thyroid, lymphatic, and hematopoietic
cancers (previously included in the
“other cancer” category8) and more
precise risk estimates for other cancers.
Although some inaccuracies in cancer
notifications from the registries may
have occurred, systematic differences
between
contraceptive
groups
are
unlikely.
The study has been prone to large
losses to follow up. Previous analyses
have shown that women who were lost
to GP follow up in the study had
similar mortality rates to those still
under observation,9 which suggests no
systematic bias from loss to follow up.
Mortality rates in the study have been
found to be lower than the general
population,10 mainly because women
with
chronic
disease
were
not
recruited.5
Age-specific
rates
of
all
cancer that was seen in our study,
however, were generally only slightly
lower than those for women living in
the United Kingdom for 2011-201311
(Table 6). The observed differences
would affect our estimates of absolute
risk
but
not
comparisons
between
contraceptive
groups,
unless
oral
contraception impacts differently on
those women with underlying health
conditions or risk factors for cancer. We
found
little
evidence
of
this
with
regards to age, parity, social class, or
smoking (Table 4). It is possible, how-
ever, that at least some of the lower
IRRs for some types of cancer that were
seen in the >35 years after stopping
group may have been due to a healthy
cohort effect.
The IRRs were adjusted for smoking
and social class at recruitment and age
and parity at time of event. Residual
confounding from other personal or
lifestyle factors might have affected our
results. For example, we did not have
information for the whole cohort about
potential confounders such as body
mass
index,
alcohol,
diet,
exercise,
menarche, menopause, or family his-
tory. Neither did we have updated
smoking
information
for
all
the
women. In a separate substudy, we
found
that
more
women
stopped
smoking than started, but with fewer
pill users stopping than never users.12
In theory this means that a larger pro-
portion of women in the smoking
group at recruitment will have been
misclassified as smokers when, in fact,
they became ex-smokers during the
study than those in the nonsmoker
group at recruitment who subsequently
started
smoking.
This
differential
misclassification could have led to an
underestimation of effects of smoking
in smoking-related cancers. This said,
in a subgroup of the cohort who pro-
vided
updated
information
about
smoking habits in a health survey in the
mid 1990s, risk estimates of myocardial
infarction were virtually identical when
derived with the use of updated smok-
ing information compared with those

 produced with the use of smoking in-
formation at recruitment.12
In this article, we could not adjust for
hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
use because we did not know about such
use after women left GP observation; we
did collect information about such us-
age while under GP follow up. Oral
contraceptive users in our study who did
not have a hysterectomy were more
likely to use HRT subsequently than
similar never users.13 In a previous pa-
per in which we examined cancer risk
among women while under GP obser-
vation, adjustment for HRT made little
difference to the unadjusted results.8
HRT use, however, is associated with
an increased risk of breast and ovarian
cancer in current and recent users.14,15 It
is noteworthy therefore that we found
no overall increased risk of breast cancer
among oral contraceptive ever users,
although many will have also used HRT.
Similarly noteworthy is the continued
observation of a significant reduction
overall in ovarian cancer risk among
ever users of oral contraception, which
suggests a powerful counterbalance to
any harmful ovarian effects of subse-
quent HRT use.
We censored women from analyses of
the same cancer but not from analyses of
other cancers because women remained
at risk of the development of another
type of cancer. It is possible that treat-
ments for a first cancer may affect the
risk of another cancer. For example,
tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer
may increase the risk of endometrial
cancer.16 Overall, 704 of all the women
(10.0%) with 1 cancer had at least
another type of cancer, which suggests
minimal problems from such concerns.
We did not conduct analyses by the
hormonal content of the pill, principally
because most women in the study used
>1 preparation, which made it impos-
sible to know whether any cancer asso-
ciations are due to the effects of the last
preparation used or lingering effects
from previously used products. Most
oral contraceptives that were used in our
study contained 50mg of estrogen com-
bined with an older progestogen, which
was used mostly by women who had
completed their families. Our findings
therefore may not reflect the experience
of today’s user, although limited evi-
dence
suggests
similar
effects
from
currently available products.17-23 Very
few studies have reported cancer associ-
ations with nonoral combined hormonal
contraception. Limited evidence related
to deep venous thrombosis suggests that
such preparations have a similar or
slightly higher risk than oral products.24
Thus, until empiric evidence becomes
available, users of nonoral combined
hormonal contraceptives should assume
that they have a similar pattern of cancer
risk as oral preparations.
Few studies have assessed the very
long-term cancer risk among women
who have used oral contraceptives.
Metaanalyses of breast cancer and oral
contraception show a modest elevated
risk among ever users,25,26 which reflects
the temporary increased risk in current
and recent users. The absence of long-
term breast cancer risk in our study is
reassuring and supports findings from 2
other cohort studies: the Oxford-Family
Planning Association study27 and the
Nurses’ Health Study.28 The Oxford-
Family
Planning
Association
study
found an elevated risk of cervical cancer
among ever users of oral contracep-
tives.27 This observation was contrary to
our findings, and a reanalysis of global
data that suggests that the elevated cer-
vical cancer risk in current and recent
users disappears within approximately
10 years of stopping oral contracep-
tion.29 The reduced risk of ovarian and
endometrial cancer in our study is
consistent with the global evidence that
oral contraception provides prolonged
protection.20,21 Colorectal cancer was
also reduced in ever users in our study,
including those >35 years after stopping.
Widespread implementation of effec-
tive cervical cancer prevention measures
such as human papillomavirus vaccina-
tion or cervical cancer screening should
result in reduced cervical cancer inci-
dence over time and result in an even
more favorable overall balance of main
gynecologic cancer in ever users.
The
International
Agency
for
Research on Cancer Working Group
concluded that oral contraception is
unlikely to alter the risk of thyroid, lung,
stomach,
urinary
tract,
gallbladder,
pancreas cancer, or the risk of lym-
phoma, cutaneous melanoma, and tu-
mors of the central nervous system.4 Our

 findings do not suggest a need to review
this conclusion.
In many parts of the world, such as the
Americas, Europe, and the Western Pa-
cific,
lung
cancer
is
common
or
becoming so.3 Most lung cancers occur
in people who have smoked or been
exposed to smoking. In our study, the
attributable risk of smoking �15 ciga-
rettes each day at recruitment was
approximately 250 per 100,000 woman-
years, which is a powerful reminder of
the need for strong policies to dissuade
women from smoking.
Patterns of cancer vary widely around
the world.3 Our results therefore may
not reflect the experience of oral con-
traceptive users who live in other global
regions. It is reassuring, however, to find
that, in 1 of the regions of the world with
high cancer incidence among women,
there is no indication of substantial
lifetime cancer risk among ever users
>35 years after stopping this popular
method of contraception.
