BACKGROUND: One goal for high-quality patient care is communicating treatment costs to patients, yet cost information can be elu-
sive. This is especially relevant for breast cancer care, for which numerous guideline-concordant adjuvant chemotherapy regimens ex-
ist. The objective of the current study was to generate cost estimates for such regimens from payers’ and patients’ perspectives in a
large, insured US population. METHODS: Adult women who had incident breast cancer diagnosed between 2008 and 2012 (from the
MarketScan database), had no secondary malignancy within 1 year of diagnosis, and received chemotherapy within 3 months of diag-
nosis were included (n 5 14,643). Total and out-of-pocket costs were calculated using all claims within 18 months of diagnosis and
were normalized to 2013 US dollars. The extended estimating equations method was used to assess cost by regimen adjusting for de-
mographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: Among patients who did and did not receive trastuzumab, the median insurance payments
were $160,590 and $82,260, respectively, and the median out-of-pocket payments were $3381 and $2724, respectively. Among
patients who did not receive trastuzumab, 25% paid more than $4712, and 10% of patients paid more than $7041. For patients who
did receive trastuzumab, 25% paid more than $5604, and 10% paid more than $8384. Among patients who were covered by high-
deductible health plans, the median out-of-pocket cost was $5158, 25% paid at least $8128, and 10% paid � $11,344. CONCLUSIONS:
The costs of breast cancer chemotherapy vary widely across regimens, and patients bear a substantial out-of-pocket burden. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, the costs of cancer care in the United States have been rising and have become a major burden both
for the health care system and for patients. Expenditures for cancer care have grown from $72 billion in 2004 to $125 bil-
lion in 2010 and are estimated to reach $158 billion by 2020.1 The costs of cancer care are increasing at an unsustainable
rate—2 to 3 times faster than other health care costs.2 Patients’ out-of-pocket costs have also been rapidly increasing.3 The
high costs of cancer care have been associated with lower adherence to medications, serious material and psychological fi-
nancial hardship, and increased rates of bankruptcy.4-6 A recent study of cancer survivors reported an association between
bankruptcy and mortality rates, suggesting that patients with severe financial hardship had worse outcomes.7
Because the cost of cancer care has the potential to have a significant impact on patients and their families, the 2013
Institute of Medicine report Delivering High-Quality Cancer Care: Charting a New Course for a System in Crisis recom-
mends providing patients with information on the cost of care.8 Discussions regarding costs of care are important for all
patients but may be particularly relevant when patients have choices between treatment options of similar efficacy. This
situation often arises for patients with breast cancer, because they may be offered numerous potential chemotherapy regi-
mens in the adjuvant setting. For instance, the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines list 12 accept-
able regimens for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer and 9 possible regimens for
HER2-positive breast cancer.9 Although it is recognized that communicating the costs of treatment with patients is an im-
portant component of high-quality care, a lack of available cost information has hindered this aspect of patient-centered

generate estimates of costs for adjuvant breast cancer regi-
mens from payers’ and patients’ perspectives in a large, in-
sured US population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
From the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encoun-
ters and Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of
Benefits databases, we used a modified algorithm10 to
identify women aged �18 years who had incident breast
cancer diagnosed between 2008 and 2012. The date of
first breast cancer surgery for each patient was defined as
the diagnosis date. Patients who developed a secondary
malignancy (International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision codes 196.x-199.x) within 1 year of diag-
nosis were excluded. We required patients to have contin-
uous enrollment from 6 months before to 18 months after
diagnosis and to have received chemotherapy within 3
months of diagnosis. By using these criteria, we identified
14,643 patients. The algorithm used to select the patient
cohorts is provided in Supporting Table l (see online sup-
porting information).
Chemotherapy Regimens
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes
were used to define patients’ chemotherapy regimens. The
regimen-selection codes were similar to those previously
reported11 and are described below.
The selected regimens were divided into 2 groups:
nontrastuzumab regimens and trastuzumab regimens.
The nontrastuzumab regimens included: 1) TC, docetaxel
(T) and cyclophosphamide (C) on the same day, no
anthracycline; 2) AC, doxorubicin (A) and cyclophospha-
mide on the same day, no taxane; 3) TAC, docetaxel,
doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide on the same day; 4)
AC 1 T, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide on the same
day, followed or preceded by docetaxel; 5) ddAC 1 P,
dose-dense (dd) doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
(AC) cycled every 2 weeks, followed or preceded by pacli-
taxel (P) cycled for longer than 1 week, or received only 1
dose of paclitaxel; 6) AC 1 P, doxorubicin and cyclophos-
phamide cycled every 3 weeks or only 1 cycle, followed or
preceded by paclitaxel; 7) ddAC 1 wP, dose-dense doxo-
rubicin and cyclophosphamide cycled every 2 weeks, fol-
lowed or preceded by weekly (w) paclitaxel; 8) CMF,
cyclophosphamide, methotrexate (M), and fluorouracil
(F) on the same day; and 9) other, other nontrastuzumab
regimens that did not fall into the above categories, which
included patients who received epirubicin (with or with-
out paclitaxel or docetaxel), paclitaxel, or docetaxel only
and other drugs that did not fall into any of the regimens
described above. The trastuzumab-based regimens includ-
ed: 1) TCarboTr, docetaxel, carboplatin (Carbo), and
trastuzumab (Tr), no anthracycline; 2) AC 1 PTr,
AC 1 P, as defined as above, with trastuzumab; 3)
ddAC 1 PTr, dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophospha-
mide cycled every 2 weeks, followed or preceded by pacli-
taxel,
with
trastuzumab;
4)
TCTr,
docetaxel
and
cyclophosphamide on the same day, with trastuzumab, no
anthracycline; 5) PTr, paclitaxel and trastuzumab; 6) Tr
only, trastuzumab as a single agent; and 7) other, other
trastuzumab-based regimens, which included AC 1 Tr,
TAC 1 Tr, PCTr, and other treatments. The time inter-
val between the chemotherapy doses were defined as fol-
lows: intervals < 12 days between claims were considered
weekly, those from 12 to 18 days were considered every 2
weeks, and those > 18 days were considered every 3
weeks.
Patient and Treatment Variables
Patient variables, including age at diagnosis, geographic
region, diagnosis year, and insurance plan type, were de-
fined from claims at their diagnosis date; and treatment
variables, including surgery type, breast reconstruction,
radiation therapy, and receipt of granulocyte-colony stim-
ulating factor (G-CSF) were defined by claims within 18
months of diagnosis. Hormone therapy was identified us-
ing the National Drug Code numbers from prescription
claims. The Deyo comorbidity score was calculated from
claims in the 6 months before diagnosis.12 The Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and
Common Procedural Terminology/Healthcare Common
Procedure Coding System codes used in this study are
listed in Supporting Table 2 (see online supporting
information).
Chemotherapy-Related Toxicities
Chemotherapy-related toxicities were assessed from inpa-
tient claims within 6 months of chemotherapy, as previ-
ously described.11 Briefly, patients who had any of the
following 8 reasons for hospitalization within 6 months
were considered to have chemotherapy-related toxicities:
neutropenia, infection, fever, thrombocytopenia, anemia,
adverse
effects
of
chemotherapy,
dehydration,
and
delirium.
Costs and Statistical Analysis
Total costs for each patient were calculated from the
payers’ and patients’ perspectives using all inpatient,

 outpatient, and prescription claims within 18 months of
diagnosis. We examined 3 types of costs: 1) drug-related
costs, 2) drug-related costs and growth factor-related costs
summed, and 3) total costs. We considered both insur-
ance payments and patient out-of-pocket payments. All
costs were normalized to 2013 US dollars by adjusting for
inflation using the Prospective Pricing Index for inpatient
claims and the Medicare Economic Index for outpatient
claims.13,14 Median and mean costs were calculated. To
account for the skewness in medical costs data, the extend-
ed estimating equations method was used to assess the ad-
justed mean cost. Patient characteristics and treatment
variables were compared across regimens using the chi-
square test. Statistical analyses were conducted with the
software packages SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC) and STATA version 13.1 (StataCorp, College
Station, Tex). The study was reviewed by the Institutional
Review Board and was granted an exemption.
RESULTS
Among the 14,643 patients with breast cancer who were
included in this study, 11,209 (76.5%) received nontras-
tuzumab
regimens,
and
3434
(23.5%)
received
trastuzumab-based regimens. Patient characteristics and
the distribution of chemotherapy regimens are provided
in Table 1 (nontrastuzumab regimens) and Table 2 (tras-
tuzumab regimens).
Table 1 indicates that the most commonly used non-
trastuzumab regimen was TC (46%), and the second
most common was ddAC 1 P (11.8%). Among the
patients who received these regimens, the median age
ranged from 51 to 58 years and was lowest for those who
received dose-dense chemotherapy (51 years) and highest
for those who received CMF (CMF) (58 years). All pa-
tient and treatment characteristics differed significantly
across regimens. The rates of chemotherapy-related hospi-
talizations within 6 months of first chemotherapy also are
provided in Tables 1 and 2 and were highest for patients
who received TAC (13.7%) and lowest for those who re-
ceived CMF (4.8%).
Table 2 indicates that the most commonly used
trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimens were TCar-
boTr (57%) and ddAC 1 PTr (11%). Among the
patients who received these regimens, the median age
ranged from 51 years for those who received ddAC 1 PTr
to 62 years for those who received trastuzumab without
cytotoxic chemotherapy. All other patient and treatment
characteristics (except insurance plan types) varied signifi-
cantly across regimens, as also indicated in Table 1 for the
nontrastuzumab regimens. The rates of chemotherapy-
related hospitalizations were highest in patients who re-
ceived other trastuzumab-based regimens (9.7%) and
patients who received TCarboTr (9.6%).
We investigated insurance payments in the 18
months after breast cancer diagnosis by chemotherapy
regimen. When only the drug cost of chemotherapy was
evaluated, TAC was the most costly regimen for patients
who received nontrastuzumab regimens; and, in general,
regimens that included docetaxel were more expensive
than those that did not (Fig. 1). Figure 1A illustrates costs
of the drugs in each regimen over time, and Figure 1B
includes the costs of both chemotherapy and growth fac-
tors. It is worth noting that the expense of dose-dense regi-
mens increases substantially when the use of growth
factors is taken into account. Growth factors add approxi-
mately $15,000 to the cost of chemotherapy for most regi-
mens. With or without growth factors, TAC remains the
most costly regimen. The costs do not differ significantly
for each regimen across different years of diagnosis. Figure
1C,D illustrates the drug-related costs for patients who re-
ceived regimens that included trastuzumab. In most years,
TCarboTr was the most expensive trastuzumab-based reg-
imen. Costs were lower when patients received trastuzu-
mab without chemotherapy, as would be expected. We
also calculated insurance payments for a single cycle of
each regimen, because adjuvant regimens can differ in the
number of cycles required. These results are provided in
Table 3. The cost of 1 cycle of docetaxel is >10 times the
cost of 1 cycle of paclitaxel. It is noteworthy that the pacli-
taxel and trastuzumab combination is less expensive than
single-agent trastuzumab, because the former is a usually a
smaller weekly dose, whereas the latter is predominately a
larger dose given every 3 weeks.
The median and mean total insurance payments
over the 18 months after diagnosis are detailed in Table 4.
Differences in costs after adjustment for patient and treat-
ment factors are also presented in Table 4, in which differ-
ences that were statistically significant compared with the
reference group are indicated. Among the patients who
did not receive trastuzumab, the median insurance pay-
ment was $82,260. The median unadjusted costs ranged
from $62,302 for patients who received CMF to
$104,197 for those who received TAC. After adjustment,
the mean cost remained lowest among patients who re-
ceived CMF and highest among those who received TAC
(adjusted difference in cost between CMF and TAC,
$29,392). Across regimens that included both an anthra-
cycline and taxane, the adjusted mean costs varied by
$13,835 (lowest, ddAC 1 wP; highest, TAC). Among
patients who received trastuzumab, the median insurance

 payment was $160,590. The lowest median insurance
payment was reported in patients who received trastuzu-
mab without chemotherapy ($106,369), and the highest
was
reported
in
those
who
received
TCarboTr
($169,567). In the adjusted analysis, the mean cost also
was highest in patients who received TCarboTr. Patients
who received AC 1 PTr had insurance costs that were
$20,168 less than the costs for those who received
TCarboTr.
Table 4 also details patients’ out-of-pocket payments
by regimen. Overall, the median out-of-pocket payment
was $2724 for patients who did not receive trastuzumab
and $3381 for those who did receive trastuzumab.
Patients’ adjusted out-of-pocket costs were lowest among
patients
who
received
CMF
or
AC.
Among
the
trastuzumab-treated
patients,
out-of-pocket
expenses
were lowest for individuals those who received Tr only or
PTr. Patients’ out-of-pocket payments were generally sim-
ilar for patients who received TCarboTr, AC1 PTr, or
ddAC1 PTr (the adjusted difference across these regi-
mens was �$108). The range of out-of-pocket payments
was large, as illustrated in Figure 2. Among the patients
who did not receive trastuzumab, 25% paid > $4712, and
10% paid > $7041. Among the patients who received
trastuzumab, 25% paid > $5604, and 10% paid> $8384.
Patients who were enrolled in high-deductible health plans
comprised 1.8% of the cohort. Among these patients, the
median out-of-pocket cost was $5158, 25% of patients
paid � $8128, and 10% of patients paid � $11,344.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we have estimated the total payments
for chemotherapy-treated patients with breast cancer in
the initial 18 months of care and have observed substantial

 variation by chemotherapy regimen. Even across regimens
of similar efficacy, the costs were quite different. For ex-
ample, among patients who received an adjuvant regimen
containing both an anthracycline and a taxane, the adjust-
ed costs varied by almost $14,000. Similarly, for patients
who received trastuzumab-based chemotherapy, the ad-
justed costs differed by approximately $20,000 for
AC 1 PTr versus TCarboTr. Because it is estimated that
approximately 249,260 new breast cancers will be diag-
nosed in 2016,15 and that at least 35% of patients with
breast cancer will receive adjuvant chemotherapy,16 the
use of an equally effective but less costly regimen versus
the most expensive regimen for most patients (for in-
stance, ddAC 1 wP vs TAC for HER-2–negative breast
cancer) could impact national costs of breast cancer care
by over $1 billion each year.
We also observed substantial out-of-pocket costs
within our study cohort of privately insured patients. Al-
though median costs were between $2500 and $3500,

 10% of patients paid more than $7000 to $8000 for their
care. Patients with high-deductible health care plans had
notably higher out-of-pocket costs, with a median cost of
over $5000. However, despite the large differences in total
payment across the regimens, the differences in out-of-
pocket costs were relatively small, likely reflecting the
maximum out-of-pocket policy in some patients’ insur-
ance benefit design and that the cost of trastuzumab
would push patients over the out-of-pocket maximum,
thus reducing their subsequent cost-sharing to zero. These
data indicate a critical need to convey pertinent health
plan information to patients as they make informed deci-
sions on their treatment plans, with the hope of lessening
the psychological and physical stress associated with can-
cer care costs.
This study adds to the growing literature on the costs
of cancer care to patients. Yabroff et al recently reported that
many patients experience financial hardship;> 20% of those
aged� 65 years and approximately 40% of survivors
aged< 65 years reported either psychological or material
financial hardship.5 Cancer survivors are also more likely to
file for bankruptcy, and those who do so have worse cancer
outcomes.6,7 Specifically, breast cancer survivors who filed
for bankruptcy had a 50% increased risk of death.7 In a sur-
vey of insured patients with cancer who contacted a national
copayment assistance foundation, 46% of patients reported
cutting back spending on food and clothing because of the
cost of cancer care, and 42% conveyed that the cost of can-
cer care was a significant or catastrophic financial burden.4
Few previous studies have attempted to quantify patients’
out-of-pocket costs for breast cancer care. In a population-
based survey of breast cancer survivors who were diagnosed
between 2005 and 2007, the median out-of-pocket spend-
ing was under $2000, but 17% reported spending more
than $5000 on cancer care.17 Our study provides more re-
cent estimates of the out-of-pocket costs to patients who
have private insurance, and we have observed that these costs
are higher than previously reported.
To address the rising costs of cancer care, the Ameri-
can Society for Clinical Oncology formed a Task Force
on the Cost of Cancer Care in 2007. In 2013, that group
was renamed the Value in Cancer Care Task Force. The
group was charged with developing a framework for com-
paring clinical benefit, toxicity, and the cost of cancer
treatments; the conceptual framework was published in
2015.18 Our current data can help inform these discus-
sions regarding the relative value of different adjuvant
treatments for breast cancer. In addition to generating

 data on the costs of care, we have also assessed the toxicity
by calculating the rates of hospitalizations for each regi-
men, building on our prior work in this area.11 It is nota-
ble that some of the most costly regimens, such as TAC,
both are the most expensive and are associated with the
highest risk of hospitalization and thus may represent a
lower value option than less expensive, less toxic regimens
that offer similar clinical benefit.
Our study has several limitations. We have focused
these analyses on a younger population with private health
care insurance. Those patients who lack insurance may
face considerably higher costs of care. Given the diagnosis
years that we studied, we were not able to evaluate the cost
of newer drugs, such as pertuzumab. We chose to evaluate
costs over an 18-month period because we wanted to in-
clude the entire duration of trastuzumab (12 months),
which may not start for several months after diagnosis.
With this 18-month time frame, we are not able to esti-
mate the total costs of breast cancer care, because patients
may receive delayed reconstruction outside of this window
and may receive adjuvant hormone therapy for 5 to 10
years. We relied on insurance claims to determine the
dates of diagnosis and all of the received treatments, and
we recognize that some misclassifications are inherent in
claims-based analyses. Costs may change over time as
more chemotherapy drugs become generic. Finally, be-
cause these data are not linked to cancer registry data, we
did not have information on cancer stage, patient race/
ethnicity, or tumor characteristics.
Oncology care providers need to continue to move
toward the goal of providing high-value care that is
aligned with our patients’ goals and preferences. Because
of the rising costs of care and increased cost-sharing for
patients, the expense of treatment is becoming more rele-
vant to patients and their families, and providers need
more accessible information to be able to answer patients’
questions about the financial impact of their treatment
choices. Although our analyses were limited to privately
insured patients, we hope that these data will help patients
and providers to be better informed about the potential
costs of care across the many options for adjuvant breast
cancer chemotherapy regimens.
