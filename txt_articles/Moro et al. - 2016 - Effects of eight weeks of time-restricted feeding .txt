Abstract 
Background: Intermittent fasting (IF) is an increasingly popular dietary approach used for weight loss and overall 
health. While there is an increasing body of evidence demonstrating beneficial effects of IF on blood lipids and other 
health outcomes in the overweight and obese, limited data are available about the effect of IF in athletes. Thus, the 
present study sought to investigate the effects of a modified IF protocol (i.e. time-restricted feeding) during resistance 
training in healthy resistance-trained males.
Methods: Thirty-four resistance-trained males were randomly assigned to time-restricted feeding (TRF) or normal 
diet group (ND). TRF subjects consumed 100 % of their energy needs in an 8-h period of time each day, with their 
caloric intake divided into three meals consumed at 1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 8 p.m. The remaining 16 h per 24-h period 
made up the fasting period. Subjects in the ND group consumed 100 % of their energy needs divided into three 
meals consumed at 8 a.m., 1 p.m., and 8 p.m. Groups were matched for kilocalories consumed and macronutri-
ent distribution (TRF 2826 ± 412.3 kcal/day, carbohydrates 53.2 ± 1.4 %, fat 24.7 ± 3.1 %, protein 22.1 ± 2.6 %, ND 
3007 ± 444.7 kcal/day, carbohydrates 54.7 ± 2.2 %, fat 23.9 ± 3.5 %, protein 21.4 ± 1.8). Subjects were tested before 
and after 8 weeks of the assigned diet and standardized resistance training program. Fat mass and fat-free mass were 
assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and muscle area of the thigh and arm were measured using an anthro-
pometric system. Total and free testosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1, blood glucose, insulin, adiponectin, leptin, 
triiodothyronine, thyroid stimulating hormone, interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor α, total cholesterol, 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured. Bench 
press and leg press maximal strength, resting energy expenditure, and respiratory ratio were also tested.
Results: After 8 weeks, the 2 Way ANOVA (Time * Diet interaction) showed a decrease in fat mass in TRF compared 
to ND (p = 0.0448), while fat-free mass, muscle area of the arm and thigh, and maximal strength were maintained 
in both groups. Testosterone and insulin-like growth factor 1 decreased significantly in TRF, with no changes in 
ND (p = 0.0476; p = 0.0397). Adiponectin increased (p = 0.0000) in TRF while total leptin decreased (p = 0.0001), 
although not when adjusted for fat mass. Triiodothyronine decreased in TRF, but no significant changes were detected 
in thyroid-stimulating hormone, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, or triglycerides.

Background
Fasting, the voluntary abstinence from food intake for a 
specified period of time, is a well-known practice asso-
ciated with many religious and spiritual traditions. In 
fact, this ascetic practice is referenced in the Old Tes-
tament, as well as other ancient texts such the Koran 
and the Mahabharata. In humans, fasting is achieved 
by ingesting little to no food or caloric beverages for 
periods that typically range from 12 h to 3 weeks. Mus-
lims, for example, fast from dawn until dusk during the 
month of Ramadan, while Christians, Jews, Buddhists, 
and Hindus traditionally fast on designated days or peri-
ods [1]. Fasting is distinct from caloric restriction (CR), 
in which daily caloric intake is chronically reduced by 
up to 40 %, but meal frequency is maintained [2]. In 
contrast to fasting, starvation is a chronic nutritional 
deficiency that is commonly incorrectly used as a sub-
stitute for the term “fasting”
. Starvation could also refer 
to some extreme forms of fasting, which can result in 
an impaired metabolic state and death. However, starva-
tion typically implies chronic involuntary abstinence of 
food, which can lead to nutrient deficiencies and health 
impairment. While a prolonged period of fasting is dif-
ficult to perform for the normal population, an inter-
mittent fasting (IF) protocol has been shown to produce 
higher compliance [3]. Typically, IF is defined by a com-
plete or partial restriction in energy intake (between 50 
and 100 % restriction of total daily energy intake) on 
1–3 days per week or a complete restriction in energy 
intake for a defined period during the day that extends 
the overnight fast. The most studied of the above form 
of IF is Ramadan fasting: during the holy month of 
Ramadan, which varies according to the lunar calendar, 
Muslims abstain from eating or drinking from sunrise 
to sunset. The effects of Ramadan have been extensively 
investigated, not only on health outcomes [1, 4–8], 
but also on exercise performance [9–16]. Moreover, in 
recent years a focus on other forms of IF, unrelated to 
religious practice, has emerged. One such form, alter-
nate day fasting (ADF; fasting every other day) is organ-
ized with alternating “feast days,” on which there is an 
“ad libitum” energy intake, and “fast days” with reduced 
or null energy intake.
A growing body of evidence suggests that, in general, 
IF could represent an useful tool for improving health 
in general population due to reports of improving blood 
lipids [17–20] and glycaemic control [3], reducing circu-
lating insulin [21], decreasing blood pressure [1, 21–23], 
decreasing inflammatory markers [7] and reducing fat 
mass even during relatively short durations (8–12 weeks) 
[23]. These reported effects are probably mediated 
through changes in metabolic pathways and cellular 
processes such as stress resistance [24], lipolysis [3, 17, 
25–27], and autophagy [28, 29]. One particular form of IF 
which has gained great popularity through mainstream 
media is the so-called time-restricted feeding (TRF). 
TRF allows subjects to consume ad libitum energy intake 
within a defined window of time (from 3–4 h to 10–12 h), 
which means a fasting window of 12–21 h per day is 
employed. A key point concerning the IF approach is that 
generally calorie intake is not controlled, but the feeding 
times are.
In sports, IF is studied mainly in relationship with 
Ramadan period [9–16], whilst TRF has become very 
popular among fitness practitioners claiming supposed 
effects on maintenance of muscle mass and fat loss. Very 
limited scientific information is available about TRF 
and athletes, and mixed results have been reported [22, 
30, 31]. We demonstrated very recently [30] that TRF 
did not affect total body composition nor had negative 
effects on muscle cross-sectional area after 8 weeks in 
young previously-untrained men performing resistance 
training, despite a reported reduction in energy intake 
of ~650 kcal per fasting day in the TRF group. Thus the 
aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of 
an isoenergetic TRF protocol on body composition, ath-
letic performance, and metabolic factors during resist-
ance training in healthy resistance trained males. We 
hypothesized that the TRF protocol would lead to greater 
fat loss and improvements in health-related biomarkers 
as compared to a typical eating schedule.
Methods
Subjects
Thirty-four resistance-trained males were enrolled 
through advertisements placed in Veneto region’s gyms. 
Resting energy expenditure was unchanged, but a significant decrease in respiratory ratio was observed in the TRF 
group.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that an intermittent fasting program in which all calories are consumed in an 8-h 
window each day, in conjunction with resistance training, could improve some health-related biomarkers, decrease 
fat mass, and maintain muscle mass in resistance-trained males.

The criteria for entering the study were that subjects 
must have performed resistance training continuously 
for at least 5 years (training 3–5 days/week with at least 
3 years experience in split training routines), be pres-
ently engaged in regular resistance training at the time 
of recruitment, be life-long steroid free, and have no 
clinical problems that could be aggravated by the study 
procedures.
Fifty-three subjects responded to the advertisement, 
but 7 were excluded for previous use of anabolic ster-
oids, and 12 declined participation after explanation of 
study’s protocol. Therefore, 34 subjects (age 29.21 ± 3.8; 
weight 84.6 ± 6.2 kg) were randomly assigned to a time-
restricted feeding group (TRF; n = 17) or standard diet 
group (ND; n = 17) through computer-generated soft-
ware. The research staff conducting outcome assessments 
was unaware of the assignment of the subjects (i.e. a sin-
gle blind design). Anthropometric baseline character-
istics of subjects are shown in Table 1. All participants 
read and signed an informed consent document with the 
description of the testing procedures approved by the 
ethical committee of the Department of Biomedical Sci-
ences, University of Padova, and conformed to standards 
for the use of human subjects in research as outlined in 
the current Declaration of Helsinki.
Diet
Dietary intake was measured by a validated 7-day food 
diary [32–34], which has been used in previous stud-
ies with athletes [35], and analysed by nutritional soft-
ware (Dietnext®, Caldogno, Vicenza, Italy). Subjects 
were instructed to maintain their habitual caloric intake, 
as measured during the preliminary week of the study 
(Table 2). During the 8-week experimental period, TRF 
subjects consumed 100 % of their energy needs divided 
into three meals consumed at 1 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m., 
and fasted for the remaining 16 h per 24-h period. ND 
group ingested their caloric intake as three meals con-
sumed at 8 a.m., 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. This meal timing was 
chosen to create a balanced distribution of the three 
meals during the feeding period in the TRF protocol, 
while the schedule for the ND group maintained a nor-
mal meal distribution (breakfast in the morning, lunch at 
1 p.m. and dinner at 8 p.m.). The distribution of calories 
was 40, 25, and 35 % at 1 p.m., 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. respec-
tively for TRF, while ND subjects consumed 25, 40 and 
35 % of daily calories at 8 a.m., 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. respec-
tively. The specific calorie distribution was assigned by a 
nutritionist and was based on the reported daily intake of 
each subject.
ND subjects were instructed to consume the entire 
breakfast meal between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., the entire 
lunch meal between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., and the entire din-
ner meal between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. TRF subjects were 
instructed to consume the first meal between 1 p.m. 
and 2 p.m., the second meal between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., 
and the third meal between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. No snacks 
between the meals were allowed except 20 g of whey pro-
teins 30 min after each training session. Every week, sub-
jects were contacted by a dietician in order to check the 
adherence to the diet protocol. The dietician performed a 
structured interview about meal timing and composition 
to obtain this information.

Training
Training was standardized for both groups, and all sub-
jects had at least 5 years of continuous resistance train-
ing experience prior to the study. Training consisted of 3 
weekly sessions performed on non-consecutive days for 
8 weeks. All participants started the experimental proce-
dures in the months of January or February 2014.
The resistance training program consisted of 3 differ-
ent weekly sessions (i.e. a split routine): session A (bench 
press, incline dumbell fly, biceps curl), session B (mili-
tary press, leg press, leg extension, leg curl), and session 
C (wide grip lat pulldown, reverse grip lat pulldown and 
tricep pressdown). The training protocol involved 3 sets 
of 6–8 repetitions at 85–90 % 1-RM, and repetitions 
were performed to failure (i.e. the inability to perform 
another repetition with correct execution) with 180 s of 
rest between sets and exercises [36]. The technique of 
training to muscular failure was chosen because it is one 
of the most common practices for body builders, and it 
was a familiar technique for the subjects. As expected, 
the muscle action velocity varied between subjects due to 
their different anatomical leverage. Although there was 
slight variation of repetition cadence for each subject, the 
average duration of each repetition was approximately 
1.0 s for the concentric phase and 2.0 s for the eccentric 
phase [37].
The research team directly supervised all routines to 
ensure proper performance of the routine. Each week, 
loads were adjusted to maintain the target repetition 
range with an effective load. Training sessions were per-
formed between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m. Subjects were not 
allowed to perform other exercises other than those 
included in the experimental protocol.
Measurements
Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using an 
electronic scale (Tanita BWB-800 Medical Scales, USA), 
and height to the nearest 1 cm using a wall-mounted 
Harpenden portable stadiometer (Holtain Ltd, UK). Body 
mass index (BMI) was calculated in kg/m2. Fat mass and 
fat-free mass were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorp-
tiometry (DXA) (QDR 4500 W, Hologic Inc., Arling-
ton, MA, USA). Muscle areas were calculated using the 
following anthropometric system. We measured limb 
circumferences to the nearest 0.001 m using an anthro-
pometric tape at the mid-arm and mid-thigh. We also 
measured biceps, triceps, and thigh skinfolds to the near-
est 1 mm using a Holtain caliper (Holtain Ltd, UK). All 
measurements were taken by the same operator (AP) 
before and during the study according to standard pro-
cedures [38, 39]. Muscle areas were then calculated using 
a previously [40] validated software (Fitnext®, Caldogno, 
Vicenza, Italy). Cross-sectional area (CSA) measured 
with Fitnext® has an r2 = 0.88 compared to magnetic res-
onance and an ICC of 0.988 and 0.968 for thigh and arm, 
respectively [40–42].
Ventilatory measurements were made by standard 
open-circuit calorimetry (max Encore 29 System, Vmax, 
Viasys Healthcare, Inc., Yorba Linda, CA, USA) with 
breath-by-breath modality. The gas analysis system was 
used: Oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide output val-
ues were measured and used to calculate resting energy 
expenditure (REE) and respiratory ratio (RR) using the 
modified Weir equation [43]. Before each measurement, 
the calorimeter was warmed according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions and calibrated with reference gases of 
known composition prior to each participant.
Oxygen uptake was measured (mL/min) and also nor-
malized to body weight (mL/kg/min), and the respira-
tory ratio was determined. After resting for 15 min, the 
data were collected for 30 min, and only the last 20 min 
were used to calculate the respiratory gas parameters [37, 
44]. All tests were performed in the morning between 6 
and 8 a.m. while the subjects were supine. The room was 
dimly lit, quiet, and approximately 23 °C. Subjects were 
asked to abstain from caffeine, alcohol consumption 
and from vigorous physical activity for 24 h prior to the 
measurement.
Blood collection and analysis protocol
Blood samples taken from the antecubital vein at base-
line and after 8 weeks were collected in BD Vacutainers 
Tubes (SST™ II Advance, REF 367953). Samples were 
centrifuged (4000 RPM at 4 °C using centrifuge J6-MC 
by Beckman), and the resultant serum was aliquoted 
and stored at −80 °C. All samples were analysed in the 
same analytical session for each test using the same rea-
gent lot. Before the analytical session, the serum sam-
ples were thawed overnight at 4 °C and then mixed. 
Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 
and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured using Quan-
tikine HS Immunoassay Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapo-
lis, MN, USA). The inter-assay coefficient of variations 
(CVs) were 3.5–6.2 and 3.2–6.3 % for IL-6, TNF-α and 
IL-1β respectively. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) 
was measured using the analyzer Liaison XL (DiaSorin 
S.p.A, Vercelli-Italy). This test is a sandwich immunoas-
say based on a chemiluminescent revelation, and the CV 
for IGF-1 was between 5.6 and 9.6 %; the reference range 
for this test depends on age and gender. Fasting total cho-
lesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyc-
erides (TG) were measured by an enzymatic colorimet-
ric method using a Modular D2400 (Roche Diagnostics, 
Basel, Switzerland). LDL-C fraction was calculated from 
Friedewald’s formula: LDL-C = TC − HDL-C − (TG/5). 
 Page 5 of 10
Moro et al. J Transl Med  (2016) 14:290 
The inter-assay CVs for total cholesterol, HDL-C, and 
triacylglycerol concentrations were 2.9, 1.8, and 2.4 %, 
respectively. Glucose was measured in triplicate by the 
glucose oxidase method (glucose analyzer, Beckman 
Instruments, Palo Alto, CA, USA), with a CV of 1.2 %. 
Leptin and adiponectin were measured by radioim-
munoassay using commercially available kits (Leptin: 
Mediadiagnost; Adiponectin: DRG Diagnostic); insulin 
was measured with a chemiluminescent immunoassay 
(Siemens Immulite 2000). The assay sensitivity was 1 ng/
mL, and inter- and intra-assay CVs were less than 10, 5, 
and 6 % for leptin, adiponectin, and insulin, respectively. 
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (T4), 
and free triiodothyronine (T3) were measured by auto-
mated chemiluminescence methods (ACS 180 SE; Bayer, 
Milan, Italy). Plasma testosterone was determined using 
Testosterone II (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, 
USA) performed on Modular Analytics E 170 analyzer 
with electrochemiluminescent detection.
Strength tests
One repetition maximum (1-RM) for the leg press and 
the bench press exercises was measured on separate days. 
Subjects executed a specific warm-up for each 1-RM test 
by performing 5 repetitions with a weight they could nor-
mally lift 10 times. Using procedures described elsewhere 
[45], the weight was gradually increased until failure 
occurred in both of the exercises tested. The greatest load 
lifted was considered the 1-RM. Previously published 
ICCs for test–retest reliability for leg press and bench 
press 1-RM testing was 0.997 and 0.997, respectively, in 
men, with a coefficient of variation of 0.235 for LP and 
0.290 for BP [46]. 1-RM was also assessed at baseline and 
after 4 and 8 weeks for all training exercises so that the 
necessary adjustments for possible strength increases 
could be made, thus ensuring that subjects continued to 
train at a relative intensity of 85–90 % of their 1-RM.
Statistical analysis
Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation. The 
sample size was obtained assuming an interaction of a 
Root Mean Square Standardized Effect (RMSSE) of 0.25 
with a fixed power of 80 % and an alpha risk of 5 % for 
the main variable. Through the Shapiro–Wilk’s W test, 
we assessed the normality. An independent samples t 
test was used to test baseline differences between groups. 
The two-way repeated-measures ordinary ANOVA was 
performed (using time as the within-subject factor and 
diet as the between-subject factor) in order to assess dif-
ferences between groups over the course of the study. 
Moreover we adopted a mixed model ANOVA with the 
fixed variable fat mass expressed in kg as covariate vs 
Time * Diet as random variables. All differences were 
considered significant at P < 0.05. Post-hoc analyses were 
performed using the Bonferroni test. In order to reduce 
the influence of within group variability a univariate test 
of significance (ANCOVA) was performed. We fixed as 
depended variable the Δ pre-post for each group and the 
baseline values of the outcomes were adopted as covari-
ate; IF vs ND were assumed as categorical predictors.
The analysis was performed through STATISTICA 
software (Vers. 8.0 for Windows, Tulsa, USA) and Prism 
5 GraphPad software (Abacus Concepts GraphPad Soft-
ware, San Diego, USA).
Results
After 8 weeks, a significant decrease in fat mass was 
observed in the TRF group (−16.4 vs −2.8 % in ND 
group), while fat-free mass was maintained in both 
groups (+0.86 vs +0.64 %). The same trend was observed 
for arm and thigh muscle cross-sectional area. Leg press 
maximal strength increased significantly, but no differ-
ence was present between treatments. Total testosterone 
and IGF-1 decreased significantly in TRF after 8 weeks 
while no significant differences were detected in ND. 
Blood glucose and insulin levels decreased significantly 
only in TRF subjects and conformingly a significant 
improvement of HOMA-IR was detected. In the TRF 
group, adiponectin increased, leptin decreased (but this 
was not significant when normalized for fat mass), and 
T3 decreased significantly compared to ND, without any 
significant changes in TSH. No significant changes were 
detectable for lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-c and LDL-
c), except for a decrease of TG in TRF group. TNF-α and 
IL-1β were lower in TRF at the conclusion of the study 
as compared to ND. A significant decrease of respiratory 
ratio in TRF group was recorded (Tables 3, 4).
Discussion
Fasting is a relatively well-studied metabolic state in 
sports and physical exercise due to studies of the “Rama-
dan” period observed by Muslim athletes [12, 14]. How-
ever, only a single study has reported its effect during a 
resistance training program aimed at achieving skeletal 
muscle growth [30]. Our data demonstrate that during 
a RT program, TRF was capable of maintaining mus-
cle mass, reducing body fat, and reducing inflammation 
markers. However, it also reduced anabolic hormones 
such testosterone and IGF-1.
A key point of the TRF approach utilized in the pre-
sent study is that total daily calorie intake remained the 
same while the frequency of meals (i.e. time between 
meals) was altered. This is dissimilar to many other IF 
regimens. There are a number of different IF protocols, 
most of which have the goal of reducing total energy 
intake. Additionally, unlike ADF and some other forms of 
 Page 6 of 10
Moro et al. J Transl Med  (2016) 14:290 
IF, the regimen utilized in the present study employed the 
same schedule each day, consisting of 16 h fasting and 8 h 
feeding.
Although IF has received a great amount of attention 
in recent years, the majority of studies have investigated 
the effects of IF in overweight, obese or dyslipidemic 
subjects [19–21, 47–50]. However, little is known about 
the effects of such nutritional regimens in athletes, and 
more specifically, in body builders or resistance-trained 
individuals. The present study provides the first in-depth 
investigation of IF in this population of athletes. With 
the exception of reduced triglycerides, our results do not 
confirm previous research suggesting a positive effect of 
IF on blood lipid profiles [17–19, 47, 49, 51, 52], how-
ever, it has to be taken into account that our subjects 
were normolipemic athletes. The magnitude of reduction 
in triglycerides was also smaller than is typically seen in 
individuals who have elevated concentrations prior to IF.
As reported, a decrease of fat mass in individuals per-
forming IF was observed. Considering that the total 
amount of kilocalories and the nutrient distribution 
were not significantly different between the two groups 
(Table 2), the mechanism of greater fat loss in IF group 
cannot simply be explained by changes in the quantity or 
quality of diet, but rather by the different temporal meal 
distribution. Many biological mechanisms have been

advocated to explain these effects. One is the increase of 
adiponectin that interacts with adenosine 5′-monophos-
phate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and stimulates 
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coac-
tivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) protein expression and mito-
chondrial biogenesis. Moreover, adiponectin acts in the 
brain to increase energy expenditure and cause weight 
loss [53]. It is notable that in the present study, the dif-
ferences in adiponectin between groups remained even 
when normalized relative to body fat mass, whereas the 
significant decrease of leptin (that might be considered a 
unfavorable factor for fat loss) was no longer significant 
when normalized for fat mass. Other hypothesis is an 
enhanced thermogenic response to epinephrine [54] or 
an increase in REE [55] after brief periods of fasting, but 
our preliminary data didn’t support this point.
Interestingly, although reductions in the anabolic hor-
mones testosterone and IGF-1 were observed, this did 
not correspond to any deleterious body composition 
changes or compromises of muscular strength over the 
duration of the study. It has been previously reported that 
men performing caloric restriction have lower testoster-
one than those consuming non-restricted Western diets 
[56], however, the present experiment did not restrict 
calories in the IF group. In animal models, IF influences 
the hypothalamo-hypophysial-gonadal axis and testos-
terone concentration probably through a decrease in 
leptin-mediated effects [57], but it must be considered 
that mice on a an every-other-day feeding regimen con-
sume about 30–40 % less calories over time compared to 
free feeding animals and that in our study, no differences 
in leptin concentration were seen when normalized for 
fat mass. Also, the reduction of IGF-1 in the TRF group 
deserves some discussion. A previous study by Bohulel 
et al. [11] reported no changes in the GH/IGF-1 during 
Ramadan intermittent fasting. Even though it is plausible 
that IF mimics caloric restriction through common path-
ways (e.g. AMPK/ACC) (adenosine 5′-monophosphate-
activated protein kinase/acetyl-CoA-carboxylase) [58], 
recent data on humans showed no influences of caloric 
restriction on IGF-1 [59, 60]. It is possible that the 
increase of adiponectin and the decrease of leptin could 
influence the IGF-1 concentration, even though it is 
unclear to what extent changes in adipokines impact cir-
culating IGF-1 levels following weight loss [59].
Previous studies have reported mixed results concern-
ing the ability to maintain lean body mass during IF, but 
the vast majority of these studies imposed calorie restric-
tion and did not utilize exercise interventions [22]. In our 
study, the nutrient timing related to training session was 
different between the two groups, and this could affect 
the anabolic response of the subjects [61] even though 
these effects are still unclear [62]. However, we did not 
find any significant differences between groups in fat-
free mass, indicating that the influence of nutrient timing 
may be negligible when the overall content of the diet is 
similar.
There is an increasing amount of data suggesting that 
IF could potentially be a feasible nutritional scheme to 
combat certain diseases. In the present study, both blood 
glucose and insulin concentrations decreased in the IF 
group. The potential of IF to modulate blood glucose and 
insulin concentrations has previously been discussed, but 
primarily in the context of overweight and obese indi-
viduals [3]. The concurrent increase in adiponectin and 
decrease in insulin may be related to modulation of insu-
lin sensitivity, as adiponectin concentrations have been 
positively correlated with insulin sensitivity [21, 50, 63, 
64]. Moreover, related to the well-known anti-inflamma-
tory effect of adiponectin, it is possible that the reduction 
of inflammatory markers is related to the improvement 
of insulin sensitivity. Inflammation plays an pivotal role

in insulin resistance development through different 
cytokines that influence numerous molecular pathways. 
For example, insulin resistance could be triggered by 
TNF-α via JNK and IKKβ/NF-κB (jun amino-terminal 
kinase/inhibitor of NF-κβ kinase) pathways, which may 
increase serine/threonine phosphorylation of insu-
lin receptor substrate 1. Moreover IL-6 could decrease 
insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle by inducing toll-
like receptor-4 (TLR-4) gene expression through STAT3 
(activator of transcription 3) activation. This relation-
ship is potentially bidirectional as the activation of IKKβ/
NF-κB signalling could, in turn, stimulate the production 
of TNF-α [65]. Modulation of some of these inflamma-
tory markers by IF was seen in the present study: TNF-α 
and IL-1β were lower in the TRF group than ND at the 
conclusion of the study, while IL-6 appeared to decrease 
in the TRF group, but was not significantly different from 
ND. Previous information on the impact of IF on inflam-
matory markers is limited, but a previous investigation 
by Halberg et al. [66] reported no changes in TNF-α or 
IL-6 after two weeks of modified IF in a small sample of 
healthy young men.
Although a reduction in T3 was observed in the IF 
group, no changes in TSH or resting energy expenditure 
were observed. The observed reduction in RR in the TRF 
group indicates a very small shift towards reliance on 
fatty acids for fuel at rest, although a significant statistical 
interaction for RR was not present. Fasting RR has been 
previously reported to be a predictor of substantial future 
weight gain in non-obese men, with individuals who have 
higher fasting RR being more likely to gain weight [67]. 
Interestingly, it was reported by Seidell et al. [67] that 
although RR was related to future weight gain, RMR was 
not. It should be noted that individuals with the highest 
risk of future weight gain had fasting RR > 0.85 (as com-
pared to individuals who had RR < 0.76). In the present 
study, the RR at the end of the study in both the TRF 
group and ND group do not directly fall into either of 
these categories (RR = 0.81 and 0.83, respectively).
Based on the present study, a modified IF protocol 
(i.e. TRF) could be feasible for strength athletes without 
negatively affecting strength and muscle mass. Interest-
ingly, even though androgen concentrations were low-
ered by TRF, there was no difference in muscle mass 
changes between groups (+0.64 kg in TRF vs +0.48 kg 
in ND). Caloric restriction in rodents has been reported 
to decrease testosterone and IGF-1 even though human 
data on long-term severe caloric restriction does not 
demonstrate a decrease in IGF-1 levels, but instead an 
increased serum insulin-like growth factor binding pro-
tein 1 (IGFBP-1) concentration [60, 68]. However, no data 
are available for most forms of IF. Decrease the activity 
of the IGF-1 axis could be a desirable target for reducing 
cancer risk [69], but it is also well known that the activa-
tion of the IGF-1/AKT/mTOR (insulin-like growth fac-
tor-1/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin) 
pathway is one of the keys for muscular growth. In addi-
tion to altering IGF-1, fasting can promote autophagy 
[28], which is important for optimal muscle health [70]. 
Additionally, there is a possibility that the different eating 
patterns of the groups in the present study impacted the 
relative contributions of different hypertrophic pathways 
in each group.
Some limitations of the present study should be taken 
into account. One is the different timing of meals in rela-
tionship to the training sessions that could have affected 
the subjects’ responses. On this point, there is not a 
consensus among researchers. The beneficial effects of 
pre-exercise essential amino acid-carbohydrate sup-
plement have been suggested [61], but the same group 
found that ingesting 20 g of whey protein either before 
or 1 h after 10 sets of leg extension resulted in simi-
lar rates of AA uptake [62]. Additionally, other studies 
have reported no benefit with pre-exercise AA feeding 
[71, 72]. Another limitation of the present study is that 
the energy and macronutrient composition of the diet 
was based on interview, and this approach has known 
weaknesses. Because of the limitations of this method, 
it is possible that differences in energy or nutrient intake 
between groups could have existed and played a role in 
the observed outcomes.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our results suggest that the modified IF 
employed in this study: TRF with 16 h of fasting and 
8 h of feeding, could be beneficial in resistance trained 
individuals to improve health-related biomarkers, 
decrease fat mass, and at least maintain muscle mass. 
This kind of regimen could be adopted by athletes dur-
ing maintenance phases of training in which the goal 
is to maintain muscle mass while reducing fat mass. 
Additional studies are needed to confirm our results 
and to investigate the long-term effects of IF and peri-
ods after IF cessation.
