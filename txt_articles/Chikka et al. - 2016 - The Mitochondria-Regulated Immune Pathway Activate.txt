In Brief
Chikka et al. find that mitochondrial
complex I damage activates the
p38MAPK/ATF-7 signaling pathway in the
intestine of C. elegans. Activation of the
p38MAPK/ATF-7 immune pathway in the
intestine is neuroprotective and sufficient
to prevent rotenone-induced
degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.

SUMMARY
Immunological mediators that originate outside the
nervous system can affect neuronal health. However,
their roles in neurodegeneration remain largely un-
known. Here, we show that the p38MAPK-mediated
immunepathwayactivatedinintestinalcellsofCaeno-
rhabditis elegans upon mitochondrial dysfunction
protects neurons in a cell-non-autonomous fashion.
Specifically, mitochondrial complex I dysfunction
induced by rotenone activates the p38MAPK/CREB/
ATF-7-dependent innate immune response pathway
in
intestinal
cells
of
C.
elegans.
Activation
of
p38MAPK in the gut is neuroprotective. Enhancing
the p38MAPK-mediated immune pathway in intes-
tinal cells alone suppresses rotenone-induced dopa-
minergic neuron loss, while downregulating it in
the intestine exacerbates neurodegeneration. The
p38MAPK/ATF-7 immune pathway modulates auto-
phagy and requires autophagy and the PTEN-induced
putative kinase PINK-1 for conferring neuroprotec-
tion. Thus, mitochondrial damage induces the clear-
ance of mitochondria by the immune pathway,
protecting the organism from the toxic effects of mito-
chondrial dysfunction. We propose that mitochondria
are subject to constant surveillance by innate immune
mechanisms.
INTRODUCTION
Although neurodegeneration has traditionally been viewed as a
consequence of processes autonomous to the vulnerable neu-
rons, it is becoming increasingly clear that cell-non-autonomous
mechanisms can impact the process of degeneration. Activated
microglia observed in a variety of degenerative neurological
conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), Pick’s disease,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington’s disease,
actively contribute to disease progression (Heneka et al., 2014).
The presence of mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD) in neigh-
boring non-neuronal supporting cells can cause cell-non-autono-
mous toxicity to motor neurons in mouse models of ALS (Ilieva
et al., 2009). Similarly, in Caenorhabditis elegans models of ALS,
the systemic activation of p38MAPK-mediated innate immunity
is required for neurodegeneration of motor neurons (Ve
´ rie
` pe
et al., 2015), and exposure of C. elegans to pathogenic bacteria
such as Pseudomonas triggers neuronal changes that are hall-
marks of neurodegeneration (Wu et al., 2015). In these examples,
immunological mediators that originate both within and external
to the nervous system exacerbate neuronal loss, suggesting roles
for intercellular communication in the degenerative process.
However, despite multiple lines of evidence that the activation
of the innate immune response is destructive, its precise role in
neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. This is because
the innate immune response can also trigger the production of
protective neurotrophic factors, promote repair and remyelina-
tion, and induce cytoprotective pathways such as autophagy (He-
neka et al., 2014). Indeed, PD pathology is associated not only
with the exacerbation of innate immunity upon chronic inflamma-
tion but also with the inhibition of the innate immune response, as
in the case of Parkin mutations (Winklhofer, 2014). This dual na-
ture of the immune response has been attributed in large part to
the differences in the temporal and spatial aspects of immune
activation and the specific immune pathways involved.
A widely used model to study mechanisms influencing neuro-
degeneration is the chronic exposure of organisms to the mito-
toxin rotenone (Bove
´ et al., 2005; Sherer et al., 2003). Mitochon-
drial dysfunction not only compromises the energy balance of
cells to influence systemic physiology (Branicky et al., 2000; Oh-
sawa et al., 2012; Schmeisser et al., 2013) but also can elicit the
degeneration of specific neurons (Perier and Vila, 2012; Przed-
borski and Jackson-Lewis, 1998) and activate the innate immune
response (Estes et al., 2010; Kirienko et al., 2015; Lartigue and
Faustin, 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Melo and Ruvkun, 2012; Pelle-
grino et al., 2014; Runkel et al., 2013; Weinberg et al., 2015;
West et al., 2011). Therefore, to better understand the relation-
ship between the activation of the innate immune response
and neurodegeneration, we examined neurodegeneration in
C. elegans caused by rotenone exposure.
RESULTS
Activation of p38MAPK and the ATF-7 Signaling
Pathways upon Rotenone Exposure Is Neuroprotective
In C. elegans and other organisms, the dopaminergic neurons
appear to be particularly susceptible to mitochondrial complex I

 dysfunction through as yet unknown mechanisms (Bove
´ et al.,
2005; Nass et al., 2002; Ray et al., 2014). While animals grown
in the absence of rotenone retained all dopaminergic neurons
as they matured into adults (% neurodegeneration = 0; n = 556),
C. elegans that developed to adulthood in the presence of
3–5 mM rotenone from larval stage 1 (L1s) lost one or more of
the six anterior dopaminergic neurons (two pairs of CEP and
one pair of ADE neurons; Figures 1A and 1B). This could be readily
visualized by expressing fluorescent mCherry under the dopami-
nergic neuron-specific dat-1 promoter (Figure 1A). Thermosen-
sory neurons similarly exposed to rotenone did not degenerate
(Figure S1A) (Nass et al., 2002). As seen in mammalian models,
the ability of rotenone to induce neurodegeneration depended
on its ability to interact with mitochondrial complex I (Johnson
and Bobrovskaya, 2015; Richardson et al., 2007; Sherer et al.,
2003), as downregulating complex I subunits nuo-1, nuo-2,
nuo-3, nuo-4, nuo-6, nduf-6, nduf-b7, and nduf-s8 suppressed
rotenone-induced dopaminergic neuron death, while downregu-
latingcomplex III subunitscyc-1 and T02H6.11 did not (Figure 1C).
Downregulating oxa-1, the more ubiquitous mitochondrial respi-
ratory chain complex assembly factor (Maxwell et al., 2013),
also suppressed neurodegeneration caused by rotenone (Fig-
ure 1C). However, while exposure to rotenone invariably caused
dopaminergic neurons to degenerate, only an average of 7% of
the animals (n > 3,000), ranging from as few as 2% to as many
as 25% per experiment, lost dopaminergic neurons; the remain-
ing animals showed no overt evidence of neurodegeneration
(Figure 1B). This suggested that there may be innate protective
mechanisms that are activated in the majority of animals to pre-
vent rotenone-induced neurodegeneration.
Mitochondrial dysfunction upregulates multiple stress res-
ponse pathways, including mitochondrial-repair pathways (Hay-
nes and Ron, 2010; Melo and Ruvkun, 2012; Runkel et al., 2013)
and oxidative stress response transcription factors such as the
FOXO homolog DAF-16 (Lemire et al., 2009) and the Nrf2 homo-
log SKN-1 (Paek et al., 2012; Palikaras et al., 2015). Recently, it
has been shown that in C. elegans mitochondrial stress activates
the innate immune response, upregulating drug-detoxification
and pathogen-response genes through the activity of the mito-
chondrial-stress-sensing transcription factor ATFS-1 and the
bZIP transcription factor ZIP-2 (Estes et al., 2010; Kirienko
et al., 2015; Lartigue and Faustin, 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Melo
and Ruvkun, 2012; Pellegrino et al., 2014; Runkel et al., 2013;
Weinberg et al., 2015; West et al., 2011). Accordingly, the
DAF-16 target mtl-1, the SKN-1 target gst-4, and the ZIP-2 target
irg-1 were all upregulated upon exposure to rotenone (Figures
S1B–S1D). Besides ZIP-2 and DAF-16, in C. elegans, the
p38MAPK signaling pathway also plays a major role in the innate
immune response, upregulating numerous secreted proteins in
response to pathogens such as Pseudomonas through the tran-
scriptional activation of the CREB-like transcription factor ATF-7
(Ermolaeva and Schumacher, 2014; Ewbank and Pujol, 2016;
Kim et al., 2002; Shivers et al., 2010). We found that systemic
exposure of C. elegans to rotenone also upregulated the
p38MAPK-dependent innate immune response pathway (Fig-
ure 1D). This was evidenced by the upregulation of numerous
ATF-7 target genes in a p38MAPK (pmk-1) and atf-7 dependent
manner (Figures 1D and 1E).
To investigate which, if any, of the multiple stress response
pathways induced by rotenone treatment protected animals
from rotenone-induced neurodegeneration, we downregulated
each of these pathways by RNAi and scored effects on
neurodegeneration (Figure 1F). Due to the variability in the range
of rotenone-induced neurodegeneration in each experiment,
these and all subsequent experiments were quantified as paired
repeats. Downregulating SKN-1 through RNAi did not increase
the numbers of animals that lost dopaminergic neurons, sug-
gesting that the SKN-1 mediated transcriptional response,
while upregulated upon rotenone exposure, did not protect
dopaminergic neurons from degeneration under the conditions
of our experiments (Figure 1F). Similarly, downregulating ZIP-2
or DAF-16 also did not enhance rotenone-induced neuron loss
(Figure 1F). Instead, downregulating ZIP-2 decreased the frac-
tion of animals that lost dopaminergic neurons, suggesting
that the activation of ZIP-2 by rotenone may even be detrimental
to neuronal health. In contrast, downregulating the p38MAPK
signaling pathway exacerbated neuronal loss (Figure 1F). In
pmk-1(km25) deletion mutants lacking p38MAPK activity, twice
the number of animals lost dopaminergic neurons upon rote-
none exposure when compared to wild-type animals. Similarly,
RNAi-mediated knockdown of atf-7 increased the number of
animals that lost dopaminergic neurons when exposed to rote-
none (Figure 1F). Moreover, atf-7 RNAi did not further exacer-
bate dopaminergic neuron loss in pmk-1(km25) animals, sug-
gesting that the activity of p38MAPK occurred through its
regulation of ATF-7 (Figure 1F). None of these animals lost
dopaminergic neurons in the absence of rotenone (% neurode-
generation = 0; n = 500–567). Downregulating another innate
immune response pathway, the transforming growth factor-b
(TGF-b)/SMA-3 pathway, had no effect (Figure 1F). Thus, it ap-
peared that the p38MAPK/ATF-7-dependent innate immune
response pathway that was induced by rotenone treatment pro-
tected animals from rotenone-induced dopaminergic neuron
degeneration.

 Activation of p38MAPK/ATF-7-Mediated Signaling in
Intestinal Cells Is Sufficient to Confer Neuroprotection
To determine the site(s) of activation of the p38MAPK/ATF-7
innate immune pathway upon rotenone exposure, we conducted
single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) in
whole animals for the ATF-7 target gene C17H12.8 (Shivers
et al., 2010) (Figures 2A, S1E, and S1F). Although animals were
systemically exposed to rotenone and exhibited neurodegener-
ation, the activation of p38MAPK evidenced by C17H12.8
expression was restricted to intestinal nuclei and could not be
detected in other cells of the animal (Figure S1E). In addition, it
appeared that the induction of p38MAPK/ATF-7 in intestinal cells
correlated with the susceptibility of animals to rotenone-induced
dopaminergic neurodegeneration, as animals that did not lose
their dopaminergic neurons despite exposure to rotenone dis-
played a larger ATF-7-dependent transcriptional response to
rotenone and expressed more ATF-7 target gene C17H12.8
mRNA in a larger number of nuclei, as determined by smFISH
(Figures 2B and 2C). Animals that had lost their dopaminergic
neurons, on the other hand, showed little to no expression of
C17H12.8 (Figures 2B and 2C).
We therefore examined whether activation of p38MAPK was
sufficient to confer neuroprotection. RNAi-mediated downre-
gulation of VHP-1 (Mizuno et al., 2004), the phosphatase that
dephosphorylates p38MAPK leading to an increase in active
p38MAPK and subsequent transcriptional activation of ATF-7
(Figure S2A), suppressed dopaminergic neurodegeneration in
all animals (0% of the animals lost dopaminergic neurons; Fig-
ure 2D). Feeding C. elegans a diet of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
which induces the p38MAPK innate immune response in intesti-
nal cells (Kim et al., 2002), also suppressed rotenone-induced
neurodegeneration, and none of the animals lost dopaminergic
neurons (Figures 2E and S2B). Overexpressing ATF-7 under
the control of its own promoter (Shivers et al., 2010) was also
sufficient to suppress rotenone-induced dopaminergic neuron
loss (Figure 2F). Remarkably, overexpression of p38MAPK only
in the gut under the control of a vha-6 promoter (Figure S2C)
(Bolz et al., 2010) increased ATF-7 target gene expression
upon rotenone exposure compared to controls (Figure S2E)
and dramatically suppressed rotenone-induced dopaminergic
neuron degeneration (Figure 2G). In contrast, animals that over-
expressed inactive p38MAPK in intestinal cells due to a TGY/
AGF substitution continued to display dopaminergic neuronal
loss at similar rates as wild-type animals (Figures S2C and 2G).
Overexpression of p38MAPK in muscle cells also suppressed
dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, albeit to a lesser extent
(Figures S2C, S2D, and S2F). The protection conferred by
p38MAPK was ATF-7 dependent; RNAi-mediated knockdown
of atf-7 partially suppressed the rescue observed upon intestinal
overexpression of p38MAPK in a wild-type background (Fig-
ure 2G) and completely suppressed the rescue in an rrf-3 mutant
background (Figure 2H), which undergoes enhanced RNAi
(Simmer et al., 2002), although for unknown reasons, the extent
of rotenone-induced neurodegeneration itself varied between
the rrf-3 and wild-type strains. Consistent with this, and as
expected, the levels of atf-7 mRNA were reduced more in the
rrf-3 background upon atf-7 RNAi than in wild-type (Figure S2H).
RNAi-mediated knockdown of atf-7 also suppressed the modest
rescue observed upon overexpression of p38MAPK in muscle
cells (Figure S2F). On the other hand, RNAi-mediated knock-
down of SKN-1 or DAF-16 did not reverse p38MAPK-mediated
neuroprotection (Figure S2G). These data, taken together, indi-
cate that p38MAPK-mediated activation of ATF-7 in intestinal
cells, as occurred upon rotenone treatment, was sufficient to
protect dopaminergic neurons from the degenerative effects of
rotenone. Experimentally inducing p38MAPK-mediated activa-
tion of ATF-7 in muscle cells by overexpressing p38MAPK was
also neuroprotective, albeit to a lesser extent.
Activation of p38MAPK-Dependent ATF-7 Transcription
Is Induced by Mitochondrial Complex I Dysfunction
Rotenone inhibits mitochondrial complex I. Dysfunctional mito-
chondria activate mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathways
that induce adaptive changes in the cell upon the loss of
mitochondrial function (Kleine and Leister, 2016). We therefore
examined whether the activation of p38MAPK and ATF-7 was
triggered by downregulating complex I, rather than being a
more general consequence of rotenone toxicity. To this end,
we used RNAi to downregulate complex I subunits and assessed
the levels of phosphorylated p38MAPK- and ATF-7-dependent

 target genes. Downregulating complex I genes nuo-2 and nduf-6
caused a significant increase in p38MAPK phosphorylation (Fig-
ure 3A). The increase in active p38MAPK levels was similar if not
greater than that seen upon rotenone exposure (Figure S3A),
perhaps because rotenone has more pleiotropic effects than
only complex I inhibition. Downregulation of mitochondrial com-
plex I also upregulated four of the seven ATF-7-dependent
genes induced by rotenone: C17H12.8, F56D6.2. and M02F4.7
(C-type lectins) and F49F1.6 (mul-1, a mucin-like protein). These
genes were upregulated upon RNAi-induced downregulation of
at least five of the six tested complex I genes to a comparable
(F49F1.6), lower (F56D6.2), or higher (M02F4.7) extent (Fig-
ure 3C). As previously shown (Shivers et al., 2010), the expres-
sion of these four ATF-7 targets was p38MAPK dependent under
basal conditions, and this was also true upon RNAi-mediated
knockdown of complex I genes (Figure S3B). In support of the
possibility that phosphorylation of p38MAPK and induction of
ATF-7-dependent gene expression was a specific retrograde
signaling pathway activated by complex I dysfunction, RNAi-
mediated downregulation of the respiratory chain complex as-
sembly factor oxa-1, complex III, complex IV, and complex V
ATP synthase subunits did not increase the levels of phosphor-
ylated p38MAPK (Figure 3B). This was the case despite the
fact that both nuo-6 and oxa-1 RNAi caused similar reactive ox-
ygen species (ROS) accumulation, as measured by the levels of
dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence (Figure 3D). As in wild-type
animals, downregulation of complex I subunits also inhibited
rotenone-induced degeneration in pmk-1(km25) animals (Fig-
ure 3E). These data, taken together, suggest that mitochondrial
complex I dysfunction acted upstream of p38MAPK signaling
and through unknown mechanisms activated p38MAPK/ATF-
7-dependent gene expression. (Figure 3F).
Overexpression of p38MAPK in Intestinal Cells Causes a
Decrease in Mitochondrial Content
How could the activation of p38MAPK and ATF-7 in intestinal
cells upon mitochondrial dysfunction protect dopaminergic
neurons? Since rotenone affects the electron transport chain
(ETC) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS),
we examined whether the p38MAPK/ATF-7-signaling pathway
conferred neuroprotection by preserving systemic ATP levels
and/or the biogenesis of mitochondrial ETC components. This
did not appear to be the case, as (1) ATP levels did not decrease
in wild-type animals on rotenone treatment, nor were there sig-
nificant differences among wild-type animals, animals on atf-7
RNAi, and animals overexpressing p38MAPK (Figure S4A); and
(2) steady-state mRNA levels of mitochondrial ETC components
and protein levels of the ATPB subunit of the ATP synthase did
not consistently or significantly change in animals overexpress-
ing p38MAPK in intestinal cells or in animals where atf-7 was
downregulated (Figures S4B and S4C). For instance, while
steady-state mRNA levels of atp-5, the ATP synthase subunit,
were higher in p38MAPK-overexpressing animals and lower
upon atf-7 RNAi (Figure S4B), protein levels of the ATP synthase
ATPB subunit did change accordingly (Figure S4C).
One of the described causes for neuronal death upon rotenone
poisoning is the increase in oxidative damage (Sherer et al., 2003).
Assessing the fluorescence levels of DHE in the first two intestinal
cells showed that rotenone increased ROS levels in wild-type an-
imals and upon atf-7 RNAi (Figure 4A). However, in p38MAPK-
overexpressing animals, the DHE fluorescence remained low
despite rotenone exposure, even though these animals did not
show obvious increases in mRNA levels of genes required to
eliminate ROS (e.g., mitochondrial SOD levels sod-2, or gst-4,
etc.; Figure S4D; data not shown). RNAi-mediated knockdown
of atf-7 moderately yet significantly increased ROS levels in
p38MAPK-overexpressing animals (Figure 4A). These data sug-
gested that p38MAPK/ATF-7-dependent decrease in oxidative
damage could be responsible for the observed neuroprotection.
A mechanism that would limit ROS accumulation and oxida-
tive damage is mitochondrial repair through the activation of
the unfolded protein response (UPRmito) (Runkel et al., 2013).
Since, in C. elegans, activation of UPRmito in neuronal cells
affects UPRmito in the intestine (Durieux et al., 2011), we exam-
ined whether UPRmito-mediated signaling could allow for the
observed cell-non-autonomous neuronal protection. However,
animals deficient in p38MAPK or ATF-7 were not deficient in
inducing UPRmito upon rotenone treatment and expressed the
UPRmito hsp-6p::GFP reporter, upregulated hsp-6 and hsp-60
mRNA to wild-type levels, and expressed wild-type levels of
HSP-60 protein (Figures S4E–S4G). Moreover, RNAi-mediated
downregulation of the transcription factor ATFS-1 (Nargund
et al., 2012), responsible for UPRmito induction, retarded growth
upon rotenone exposure but suppressed, rather than exacer-
bated, dopaminergic neuron loss in wild-type and pmk-
1(km25) animals (Figure S4H). Thus, UPRmito did not explain
the observed decrease in ROS levels in the p38MAPK-overex-
pressing animals.
Another mechanism that could limit ROS and oxidative
damage would be the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria
by mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). We therefore assessed
whether overexpressing p38MAPK affected mitochondrial con-
tent by measuring the ratio of mitochondrial to nuclear genomes
by qPCR (Figure 4B). As previously reported (Luz et al., 2015),
rotenone poisoning did not significantly change mitochondrial
copy number in wild-type animals; however, animals overex-
pressing p38MAPK in intestinal cells had significantly lower
numbers of mitochondria, both under control conditions and
upon rotenone exposure (Figure 4B), consistent with a lowering
of mitochondrial numbers and increased mitophagy. The
decrease in relative mitochondrial genome copy number upon
intestinal overexpression of p38MAPK was also ATF-7 depen-
dent, as mitochondrial copy numbers were restored to wild-
type levels upon RNAi-mediated knockdown of atf-7 (Figure 4B).

 To directly examine whether mitochondrial content was reduced
in animals overexpressing p38MAPK, we utilized a transgenic
strain expressing GFP fused to a mitochondrial signal sequence
in intestinal cells (ges-1pr::gfpmt) and assessed GFP levels using
western blot analysis in wild-type animals, in animals where
p38MAPK was activated by vhp-1 RNAi, and in animals where
atf-7 was downregulated (Figure 4C). Consistent with the

 in the intestine of animals both under control conditions and
upon rotenone treatment (Figure 4C). Mitochondrial content
upon atf-7 downregulation did not increase, but this could be,
in part, due to the variability inherent in RNAi and the resolution
of our methods. Nevertheless, these data, taken together,
suggested that p38MAPK signaling in intestinal cells may be
promoting a decrease in mitochondrial number through an
ATF-7-dependent mechanism, protecting animals from the
detrimental consequences of OXPHOS dysregulation upon rote-
none exposure.
Neuroprotection by p38MAPK-Mediated Immune
Pathway Occurs through Mitophagy
In C. elegans, mitophagy has been shown to occur through the
core autophagy machinery that includes the Atg6/Vps30/Beclin
1 ortholog BEC-1, the mammalian LC3/GABARAP ortholog
LGG-1, and the mitochondrial PTEN-induced putative kinase 1
(PINK-1) (Kirienko et al., 2015; Palikaras et al., 2015). To deter-
mine whether mitophagy was indeed responsible for neuro-
protection conferred by p38MAPK-mediated immunity, we
downregulated these genes by RNAi in an rrf-3 background, in
the absence and presence of p38MAPK intestinal overex-
pression. Downregulation of lgg-1 increased rotenone-induced
dopaminergic neuron degeneration in animals overexpressing
p38MAPK from 0.7% to 5.7%, similar to that seen upon the
knockdown of atf-7, representing almost an 8-fold increase in
the incidence of neurodegeneration (Figure 5A). Similarly, down-
regulation of bec-1 and pink-1 reversed the protection conferred
by p38MAPK overexpression (Figure 5A). Knockdown of atg-18,
a WD40 repeat containing protein required for autophagosome
formation, also reversed the neuroprotection conferred by
p38MAPK overexpression (Figure 5A). Downregulation of these
autophagy genes did not induce neurodegeneration in the
absence of rotenone (% neurodegeneration = 0; n = 300–823 an-
imals/RNAi). To test whether the suppression of p38MAPK-
mediated protection could be attributed to an increase in mito-
chondrial content as a result of downregulating autophagy
genes, we once again assessed mitochondrial content in
ges-1pr::gfpmt animals upon p38MAPK activation, but this time
in pink-1 partial deletion mutants (Figure 5B). In contrast to
what was seen in animals with functional PINK-1, in pink-
1(ok3538) mutants, GFP levels did not decrease upon activation
of p38MAPK either under control or rotenone treatment (Fig-
ure 5B; compare to Figure 4C; samples prepared in parallel).
These data indicate that the neuroprotection conferred by acti-
vating p38MAPK-mediated signaling in intestinal cells occurred
through increased mitophagy, as knockdown of genes involved
in this process completely reversed the p38MAPK-mediated
neuroprotection and prevented the decrease of mitochondrial
content that occurred upon p38MAPK activation.
We further examined whether the innate immune response
and autophagy both had to be activated in intestinal cells to
confer protection from rotenone-induced neurodegeneration or
whether autophagy was required in neurons for its neuroprotec-
tive effects. To do this, we knocked down genes involved in mi-
tophagy specifically either in intestinal cells or in neurons, using
strains sensitized to undergo RNAi only in the intestine or neu-
rons: rde-1(ne219) mutants expressing RDE-1 under the intesti-
nal nhx-2 promoter (Kumsta and Hansen, 2012; Qadota et al.,
2007) and sid-1(pk3321) expressing SID-1 under the neuronal
unc-119 promoter (Calixto et al., 2010), respectively. Once
again, although, for unknown reasons, the basal extent of rote-
none-toxicity differed in these strains, RNAi-mediated downre-
gulation of atf-7 in intestinal tissue enhanced neurodegeneration,
while knockdown only in neuronal tissue had no effect (Figures
5C and 5D). Thus, activation of p38MAPK/ATF-7 in intestinal
cells was not only sufficient but also necessary for neuroprotec-
tion. Downregulation of PINK-1 and LGG-1 in intestinal cells, but
not in neurons, also exacerbated neurodegeneration, suggesting
that their activity was also required in the intestine to limit neuro-
degeneration (Figures 5C and 5D). Neurodegeneration in the
absence of rotenone for all RNAi was 0% (n = 315–579/RNAi).
However, RNAi-mediated knockdown of bec-1 in both intestine
and neurons increased neurodegeneration (Figures 5C and 5D),
and knockdown of bec-1 in neurons increased neurodegenera-
tion even in the absence of rotenone (neurodegeneration in the
absence of rotenone = 6% ± 3.2%; n = 467), suggesting a
more complex role for autophagy in the protection of neuronal
cells. Similarly, knockdown of mboa-1 a putative acyl-coenzyme
A:cholesterol (‘‘sterol’’) O-acyltransferase previously shown to
be required for mitophagy in C. elegans (Kirienko et al., 2015)
had no effect when downregulated in intestinal cells but
decreased rather than exacerbated neurodegeneration when
targeted to neuronal cells alone (Figures S5A and S5B). These
data, taken together, showed that activation of p38MAPK/
ATF-7, as well as PINK-1 and LGG-1, in the gut was necessary
to confer neuroprotection. The tissue requirements of auto-
phagy, however, appeared more complex, and our data cannot
distinguish whether autophagy occurred only in intestinal cells or
also in neurons as a neuroprotective consequence of p38MAPK
signaling in the intestine, and further studies will be required.
The p38MAPK/ATF-7 Pathway Regulates Autophagy
Since
neuroprotection
through
p38MAPK-dependent
sig-
naling pathways required autophagy, we tested whether the
p38MAPK/ATF-7 immune pathway regulated the autophagy
process. To address this, we assessed whether the transcription
and/or translation of autophagy-pathway associated genes and
pink-1 were altered upon p38MAPK overexpression and atf-7
downregulation. Examination of a panel of autophagy-related
genes that had previously been shown to be required for
longevity assurance, including of clk-1 mitochondrial respiration
mutants (Hansen et al., 2008; Lapierre et al., 2011), showed that
in wild-type animals, rotenone exposure caused a slight but sig-
nificant increase in mRNA levels of some, but not all, of these
autophagy genes (Figure 6A). Intestinal overexpression of
p38MAPK further increased the steady-state mRNA levels of
many of these genes above wild-type levels, in some cases
under control conditions and in some cases upon rotenone
exposure (Figure 6A). These genes included atg-18 and genes
involved in the acidification and fusion of autophagosomes
(Figure 6A). Downregulation of atf-7 through RNAi had a
more dramatic and consistent effect, decreasing steady-
state mRNA levels of eight of the nine genes tested (Figure 6A).
This was the case for both basal levels of autophagy-pathway
associated genes, as well as levels in the presence of rotenone.

 Steady-state protein levels of LGG-1 tagged to GFP, GFP::
LGG-1 (Mele
´ ndez and Levine, 2009; Zhang et al., 2015), a widely
used monitor of autophagy in C. elegans, also significantly
increased with rotenone treatment in animals where p38MAPK
was activated (Figure S6A) and significantly decreased upon
RNAi-mediated knockdown of atf-7 (Figure S6B). Deletion of
p38MAPK in pmk-1(km25) animals resulted in a decrease in
GFP::LGG-1 protein levels, although this decrease did not reach
significance, as there was more variability in GFP::LGG-1
expression across numerous repeated trials (Figure S6C). The
number of autophagosomes measured as GFP::LGG-1 puncta
(Mele
´ ndez and Levine, 2009; Zhang et al., 2015) increased in in-
testinal cells of wild-type animals when exposed to rotenone.
This number was once again significantly lower in rotenone-
treated pmk-1(km25) animals lacking p38MAPK and rotenone-
treated animals on atf-7 RNAi and higher in rotenone-treated an-
imals where p38MAPK was activated using vhp-1 RNAi (Figures
6B and 6C). Animals lacking p38MAPK, pmk-1(km25) animals,
had lower numbers of GFP::LGG-1 puncta even in the absence
of rotenone treatment (Figures 6B and 6C). However, the number
of autophagosomes did increase above control levels upon rote-
none treatment in all animals except those on atf-7 RNAi (Figures
6B and 6C) consistent with the presence of other signaling path-
ways besides p38MAPK that regulate autophagy. In contrast to
the clear increase in GFP::LGG-1 puncta in intestinal cells upon
rotenone treatment, the number of GFP::LGG-1 puncta in the
pair of ADE dopaminergic neurons susceptible to degeneration
was not significantly changed upon rotenone treatment (Figures
S6D and S6E). In addition, GFP::LGG-1 puncta in ADE neurons
of animals where p38MAPK immunity was activated or downre-
gulated remained comparable, although the basal numbers of
GFP::LGG-1 puncta in these neurons differed (Figures S6D
and S6E).
Steady-state pink-1 mRNA levels also significantly increased
in animals overexpressing p38MAPK in intestinal cells (Fig-
ure 6D). Conversely, pink-1 mRNA levels were dramatically
reduced both under control conditions and upon rotenone expo-
sure when atf-7 was downregulated (Figure 6D). As the mecha-
nism of action of PINK-1 is post-translational and not necessarily
through the modulation of mRNA levels, we also examined PINK-
1::GFP protein levels in transgenic animals expressing PINK-
1::GFP under the pink-1 promoter (Sa
¨ mann et al., 2009). In these
animals, PINK-1::GFP is consistently visible in CAN neurons but
not apparent in the intestine. Nonetheless, in accordance with
the mRNA data, PINK-1::GFP levels assessed by fluorescence
intensity in CAN neurons increased upon p38MAPK overexpres-
sion (Figure S6F). These data suggest that p38MAPK/ATF-7
signaling pathway regulated autophagy at the transcriptional
and translational level, as well as its activity, supporting the
role of autophagy in the neuroprotection conferred by intestinal
overexpression of p38MAPK. In addition, it appeared that the
activation of p38MAPK in intestinal cells could not only affect
autophagy in the intestinal cells but to some extent also modified
autophagy in neurons.
DISCUSSION
In summary, our studies uncover a surprising neuroprotective
role for the triggering of the innate immune response pathway
in the gut of C. elegans by mitochondrial damage (Figure 7).
Specifically, we show that the activating the p38MAPK/ATF-7
pathway in C. elegans intestinal cells by mitochondrial dys-
function non-autonomously protects dopaminergic neurons
from rotenone-induced degeneration, while downregulating
this pathway exacerbates neurodegeneration. Neuroprotection
by p38MAPK/ATF-7 requires the core autophagy machinery
and PINK-1, which, in turn, are regulated by p38MAPK and
ATF-7, leading us to propose that p38MAPK-mediated immunity
activates mitophagy to confer neuroprotection.
While our data show that activation of p38MAPK in intestinal
cells is sufficient to confer neuroprotection, it is arguable that
activating p38MAPK in any tissue could be neuroprotective.
Thus, overexpression of p38MAPK in muscle cells also con-
ferred significant protection. However, rotenone appears to acti-
vate p38MAPK/ATF-7 signaling predominantly in the intestine
and not in other tissues, supporting a role for signaling between
the intestine and neurons in the normal course of neuroprotec-
tion. Moreover, activating p38MAPK pathways in neuronal tissue
has been shown to exacerbate rather than protect against
neuron degeneration (Kumar et al., 2003; Tortarolo et al., 2003;
Ve
´ rie
` pe et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015). These data together sug-
gest that the location, mechanisms that initiate neurodegenera-
tion, and targets of the p38MAPK signaling cascade, which
include the mediators of innate immunity, may all collude to
determine whether its activation is protective or detrimental.
It is also unclear whether the protection conferred by the
p38MAPK/ATF-7 pathway is specific to dopaminergic neurons.
Neural circuits are able to cell-non-autonomously modulate so-
matic cellular stress responses, including the innate immune
response (Kumsta et al., 2014; Maman et al., 2013; Prahlad
and Morimoto, 2011; Styer et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2011; Tracey,
2014). Interestingly, dopaminergic neurons are required for
some aspects of p38MAPK-mediated immunity in C. elegans
and mammals (Shi et al., 2013; Torres-Rosas et al., 2014). That
the activation of p38MAPK-mediated immunity in the gut in
turn protects dopaminergic neurons may suggest the existence
of a feedback loop in this regulatory mechanism.
How p38MAPK and/or ATF-7 regulate autophagy in C. elegans
remains to be understood. In other model systems, the
p38MAPK-mediated innate immune response also upregulates
autophagy (Hirota et al., 2015; Prick et al., 2006; Wei et al.,
2015), and in C. elegans, mitophagy is also activated by
p38MAPK-independent
innate
immune
responses
(Kirienko
et al., 2015). Animals treated with atf-7 RNAi are wild-type with

 respect to number of GFP::LGG-1 puncta under control condi-
tions (but express less GFP::LGG-1 protein and have lower auto-
phagy gene-mRNA levels) but have significantly fewer puncta
upon rotenone exposure. Animals deficient in p38MAPK, pmk-
1(km25) mutants, on the other hand have significantly fewer
GFP::LGG-1 puncta both on rotenone treatment as well as
under control conditions. This could mean that both p38MAPK
and ATF-7 are necessary and sufficient to upregulate auto-
phagy upon rotenone exposure when p38MAPK is activated,
and indeed activating p38MAPK by vhp-1 RNAi significantly in-
creases GFP::LGG-1 autophagosomes above control levels.
However, only p38MAPK appears to be required for normal auto-
phagosome numbers under control conditions.
It is also interesting to speculate how p38MAPK-dependent
immunity and autophagy confer cell-non-autonomous protec-
tion. p38MAPK activity is critical for normal immune and inflam-
matory responses in all animal models (Kumar et al., 2003), and
autophagy is increasingly being considered a bona fide immuno-
logical process (Deretic, 2012). One likely explanation for the
observed protection is that mitophagy induced by p38MAPK re-
duces the detrimental consequences of OXPHOS dysregulation
by limiting the numbers of damaged mitochondria. In support of
this hypothesis, ZIP-2 and ATFS-1 activity, known to activate the
UPRmito and maintain, rather than clear, dysfunctional mitochon-
dria, increase neurodegeneration (Lin et al., 2016). Besides its
role in preventing OXPHOS dysregulation, mitophagy plays a
central role in preventing the exacerbation of the innate immune
response itself (Lazarou, 2015; Nakahira et al., 2011; West et al.,
2011). It is therefore possible that activation of p38MAPK-medi-
ated immunity in remote tissues like the gut may ultimately pre-
vent neuroinflammation through inter-tissue signaling mecha-
nisms. Alternatively, an increase in autophagy in the intestine
may facilitate more general cytoprotective mechanisms, such
as changes in energy balance or alterations in ROS signaling
(Barone et al., 2011; D’Souza et al., 2013; Schroeder and Shadel,
2012), making neurons less susceptible to rotenone-induced
damage of Complex I.

is
activated in intestinal cells by mitochondrial
complex I dysfunction induced by rotenone
treatment. Activation of p38MAPK in intestinal
cells activates the core autophagy machinery
and PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK-1) to
remove dysfunctional mitochondria in intestinal
cells, conferring neuroprotection by unknown
means.
It is also possible that p38MAPK/ATF-
7 controls autophagy independent of its
role in regulating the innate immune
response. Indeed, other p38MAPK tar-
gets, such as the transcription factor
Nrf2, the SKN-1 homolog, are known to
also play neuroprotective roles (Barone
et al., 2011). While ATF-7, the ortholog
of mammalian ATF2/ATF7, has been best characterized for its
role in the upregulation of antibacterial genes like mammalian
ATF2, it may play more general roles in other stress-response
pathways. In addition, although activation of p38MAPK in intes-
tinal cells is one prominent neuroprotective pathway activated
by rotenone, there also appear to be other additional pathways,
not revealed by our studies, that protect against rotenone-
induced dopaminergic neuron loss. This is supported by the
fact that while almost all wild-type animals with intact dopami-
nergic neurons display an increase in the ATF-7 target gene
C17H12.8 as determined by smFISH, only �10% lose dopami-
nergic neurons upon atf-7 RNAi.
Our data also implicate the activation of p38MAPK/ATF-7 in
retrograde signaling by mitochondria upon complex I dysfunc-
tion, even in the absence of rotenone (Munkacsy et al., 2016).
It is intriguing that p38MAPK-dependent innate immunity acti-
vated by mitochondrial dysfunction can mobilize mitophagy.
Cells unleash complex and nuanced immune responses to
pathogens through the ability of their innate immune response
to differentiate between self and non-self, and autophagy is
increasingly being regarded as an intrinsic part of this immune
process. Thus, just as activation of the innate immune
response can clear the cell of pathogens and protect against
infection, the activation of the innate immune response upon
mitochondrial dysfunction may clear the cell of mitochondria
and protect the organism from defective mitochondria (Laz-
arou, 2015; Randow and Youle, 2014). Mitochondrial DNA
and chaperones are potent antigens and elicit inflammatory
responses through the activation of p38MAPK and other path-
ways (Kirienko et al., 2015; Lazarou, 2015; Randow and Youle,
2014; Weinberg et al., 2015; West et al., 2011). Given the ori-
gins of mitochondria, the recognition of mitochondria as inte-
gral components of the cell may be ambiguous and subject to
constant surveillance by innate immune mechanisms. Here,
we propose that one such surveillance pathway acting through
p38MAPK/ATF-7-mediated signaling can prove protective
against neurodegeneration.
