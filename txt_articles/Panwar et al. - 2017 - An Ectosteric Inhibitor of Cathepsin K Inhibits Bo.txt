ABSTRACT
The potent cathepsin K (CatK) inhibitor, Tanshinone IIA sulfonic sodium (T06), was tested for its in vitro and in vivo antiresorptive
activities. T06 binds in an ectosteric site of CatK remote from its active site and selectively inhibits collagen degradation with an IC50
value of 2.7 � 0.2 mM (CatK:T06 molar ratio of 1:5). However, it does not suppress fluorogenic peptide cleavage and gelatinolysis at a
2500-fold molar excess. Contrary to active site-directed CatK inhibitors, such as odanacatib, T06 suppresses bone resorption in both
human and mouse osteoclasts equally well (IC50 value for human and mouse osteoclasts: 237 � 60 nM and 245 � 55 nM,
respectively) and its antiresorptive activity is fully reversible in both cell types. Moreover, T06 affects neither the metabolic activity of
osteoclasts nor osteoclastogenesis. In in vivo studies, 40 mg T06/kg/d given to 12-week-old ovariectomized (OVX) mice for 3 months
reduced plasma CTx-1 by 20% and increased osteoblast numbers and plasma P1NP by �28% when compared with the OVX control.
mCT analysis of T06-treated OVX mice showed a 35% increase in bone mineral density and other femoral trabecular bone parameters
when compared with OVX animals. T06 did not alter the number of osteoclasts, had no estrogenic effect on the uterus, did not
change plasma estradiol levels, and did not inhibit fibroblast-mediated TGF-ß1 processing or degradation and cognitive functions in
OVX mice. This study indicates that the ectosteric inhibitor, T06, is a selective antiresorptive CatK inhibitor that may overcome the
shortcomings of side effect–prone active site-directed drugs, which all failed in clinical trials. © 2017 American Society for Bone and

Introduction
C
athepsin K (CatK) was discovered 22 years ago(1) and
subsequently characterized as the major bone collagen-
degrading protease in osteoclasts.(2–4) The discovery that
the lack of CatK expression in humans leads to the bone
sclerosing disorder pycnodysostosis(5) and the confirmation of
this osteopetrotic-like bone phenotype in CatK-deficient mice(6)
convinced major pharmaceutical companies to target CatK for
the treatment of osteoporosis and possibly other bone and
cartilage diseases such as arthritis and certain bone cancers.(7)
The pros for this decision were the relatively selective expression
of CatK in osteoclasts, its proven role as the therapeutically
relevant bone collagen-degrading protease without affecting
osteoclast viability when inhibited, and acting as the final
executioner in the bone resorption pathway with the promise
of fewer side effects than expected when targeting upstream,
more complex regulatory proteins such as tumor necrosis factor-
a (TNF-a) or receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL).
However, despite the successful generation of potent, selective,
and preclinically active CatK inhibitors,(8) and despite the
fact that human osteoporosis trials showed impressive bone-
preserving efficacies of CatK inhibitors(9–11) and keeping bone
formation mostly unaffected,(12) none of these compounds
were ever approved. Relacatib, balicatib, odanacatib (ODN), and
ONO-5334 were all terminated because of increased side effects
or for marketing reasons.(13) Does this mean CatK was the wrong
target? A major lapse in the development of enzyme-targeted
drugs and particularly protease-targeting inhibitors is the
assumption that it is sufficient to make highly selective
compounds that only target the protease of interest. This
ignores that many proteases, including CatK, are multifunctional
enzymes involved in various metabolic and regulatory path-
ways. Active site-directed inhibitors (all clinically tested CatK

 inhibitors belonged into this category) will block all of these
activities and likely are responsible for most of the side effects
observed in the clinical trials.
We asked the question: Is there an approach to selectively
inhibit the therapeutically relevant collagenase activity of CatK
without interfering with its other functions? We developed
the concept of ectosteric protease inhibition where specific
exosites involved in selective substrate recognition or collage-
nase activity-associated ligand and protein oligomerization sites
are targeted and the active site of the protease remains intact.
This concept differs from the allosteric one in that it does
not affect the integrity and functionality of the active site.
An allosteric inhibitor would thus run into similar problems as an
active site-directed inhibitor. We have recently compared
the efficacy of the active site-directed inhibitor, ODN, with
the ectosteric inhibitor, dihydrotanshinone I (DHTI), in human
osteoclast resorption assays. The potency of DHTI, a natural
diterpenoid, was only four times less than that of ODN but did
not interfere with other degradation pathways such as the
hydrolysis of TGF-ß1 by fibroblasts. In contrast, ODN completely
inhibited the degradation of TGF-ß1, leading to an increase
in the concentration of the growth factor.(14) Increased TGF-ß1
concentrations
have
been
implicated
in
various
fibrotic
pathologies such as scleroderma and atrial fibrillation,(15,16)
which were major concerns in the balicatib,(17) ODN,(18) and
likely ONO-5334 trials.(19) In this report, we evaluate the in vitro
and in vivo activity of Tanshinone IIA sulfonic sodium (T06).
T06 is a water-soluble derivative of Tanshinone IIA, a natural
component of the herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, which is commonly
used in traditional Chinese medicine for bone- and cardiovas-
cular-related ailments.(20,21) We show in this study that the pure
compound revealed equally potent antiresorptive potency
toward mouse and human osteoclasts, was fully reversible in
its action, did not block the turnover of TGF-ß1 in fibroblasts,
significantly increased femoral trabecular bone mineral density,
improved the bone structural parameters in OVX mice, and
increased bone formation markers. It neither had an estrogenic
effect on the uterus nor showed any apparent liver and kidney
toxicity, and it did not affect the cognitive function previously
described in CatK-deficient mice.
Materials and Methods
Collagenase and gelatinase assay
Soluble bovine type I collagen (0.6 mg/mL) was incubated with
400 nM human recombinant CatK in the presence or absence of
200 nM chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4-S) in 100 mM sodium acetate
buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and incubated at 28°C
for 4 hours. Soluble type I collagen was purchased from USB
(Cleveland, OH, USA); C4-S was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Recombinant human CatK was expressed
in Pichia pastoris and purified as previously described.(22)
Tanshinone IIA sulfonic sodium (T06) was purchased from
ChemFaces (Wuhan, PRC). Its IC50 value was determined within
the concentration range of 0.5 to 50 mM. The reactions were
stopped with 1 mM E64 and sample mixtures were separated
on 9% SDS-PAGE followed by densitometric analysis. Gelatin
was prepared by heating soluble bovine type I collagen
(0.6 mg/mL) at 70°C for 30 minutes. Inhibition of gelatinolysis
was determined by incubating 5 nM human CatK with gelatin in
100 mM sodium acetate buffer with 12.5 mM T06 at 28°C for
1 hour; 1 mM E64 was added to terminate the degradation.
Samples were analyzed on 9% SDS-PAGE and quantified on the
basis of the a1-band density in the presence and absence of
inhibitors.
Fibrillar collagen degradation
Mouse tail collagen fibers were incubated with 1 mM CatK with
or without 10 mM T06 in 100 mM acetate buffer containing
2.5 mM DTT and 2.5 mM EDTA, pH 5.5, at 28°C overnight. After
the assay was stopped by adding 1 mM E64, the reaction mixture
was centrifuged and the supernatant was analyzed by 9%
SDS-PAGE and hydroxyproline analysis (Sigma-Aldrich). For
scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis, samples were
prepared as described previously and evaluated using a Helios
NanoLab 650 (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) microscope at operating
voltages between 2 and 10 KV.(23)
Human osteoclast cultures
Osteoclasts were generated from mononuclear cells isolated
from human bone marrow purchased from Lonza (Walkersville,
MD, USA). The bone marrow cell suspension was centrifuged at
400g for 5 minutes and the pellet was resuspended in 10 mL
a-modified essential medium (a-MEM), layered over 10 mL
Ficoll-Plaque media solution, and centrifuged for 30 minutes at
500g. After centrifugation, the white interface containing the
monocytes was harvested and washed twice with a-MEM. Cells
were cultured in a-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 25 ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(M-CSF) for 24 hours and then cultured in 25 ng/mL RANKL
and 25 ng/mL M-CSF for 7 days. For bone resorption assays,
differentiated osteoclasts at a density of 100,000 cells per bone
slice (5.5 mm diameter and 0.4 mm thickness; self-made) were
seeded on each bovine cortical bone slice in the presence or
absence of inhibitors and incubated for 72 hours at 5% CO2 and
37 °C. The DMSO concentration was 0.1%. T06 inhibitor
concentrations from 50 nM to 3 mM were used to determine
IC50 values.
Murine bone marrow-derived osteoclast cultures
Bone marrow from femur and tibia was isolated from 4-month-
old mice: Cells were filtered using a 70-mm membrane and
flushed through needles of decreasing diameter (19G–21G).
Bone marrow cell suspension was processed as described for
human osteoclasts, and monocytes were harvested and washed
twice with a-MEM. Cells were cultured in a-MEM containing 10%
FBS and 25 ng/mL M-CSF for 24 hours and then cultured in
25 ng/mL RANKL and 25 ng/mL M-CSF for 7 days. For bone
resorption assays, mature osteoclasts at a density of 100,000 per
bone slice were seeded in the presence or absence of the T06
inhibitor and incubated for 72 hours at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.
Inhibitor concentrations from 50 nM to 3 mM were used in IC50
assays.
Analysis of bone resorption
The metabolic activity of osteoclasts in the culture medium was
determined using CellTiter-Blue Viability Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) to compare the effects of the inhibitors on
cell survival. Bone slices from each condition (T06-treated and
control group) were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and subsequently
stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAcP) activity
(using Acid Phosphatase, Leukocyte [TRAcP] Kit; Sigma-Aldrich).

 Aliquots from cell culture media were used to determine the
CatK-specific carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of
type 1 collagen (CTx-1) concentration (MyBiosorce ELISA kit,
San Diego, CA, USA) and the bone slices to determine the total
number of osteoclasts (2 nuclei or more) per bone slice in all
conditions. Bone slices from each condition were incubated in
filtered H2O to lyse the cells and were individually polished using
a cotton stick. Subsequently the resorption cavities were stained
with toluidine blue and analyzed by light microscopy. The
number of resorption events, eroded bone surface area, and
resorption depths were determined as described earlier.(24) The
release of calcium into the medium in the presence or absence
of T06 was determined using calcium assay kits (Abcam Inc.,
Toronto, Canada).
Reversibility of T06 activity and effect of T06 on
osteoclast differentiation
The reversibility of T06 was determined with human and mouse
osteoclasts. Osteoclasts at a density of 100,000 cells per bone
slice were seeded in the presence or absence of T06 (1 mM) in a
two-phase experiment. In phase I treatment, cells were treated
with either vehicle or 1 mM T06 for 2 days. In phase II treatment,
osteoclasts on bone slices were washed twice with media after
2 days and transferred to a new culture plate and culture media
were either switched from vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to T06, T06
to T06, or T06 to vehicle for an additional 2 days. Appropriate
controls for different conditions were cultured for 2 or 4 days in
parallel experiments for analysis.
Osteoclastogenesis experiments were performed to evaluate
the effect of T06 on osteoclast differentiation. Human and
mouse monocytes were isolated as described above. A total of
100,000 cells were seeded on each bone slice in a 96-well plate in
the presence or absence of T06 (1 and 3 mM) and incubated for
10 days at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in a-MEM supplemented with
25 ng/mL RANKL and 25 ng/mL M-CSF. Media was exchanged
every second day with or without inhibitor. Cells were stained
for TRAcP activity to quantify the effect of inhibitors on
multinucleated osteoclast formation. Cell fusion was defined
per presence of at least two nuclei in TRAcP-positive cells.
Effect of T06 on osteoblasts
Human primary osteoblasts were obtained from PromoCell
(Heidelberg, Germany). To determine the effects of T06 on cell
survival, osteoblasts were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells
per well in the presence or absence of the T06 inhibitor (1 mM)
and incubated for 72 hours at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Cell viability was
determined using the CellTiter-Blue Viability Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). Osteoblasts were stained for alkaline
phosphatase (ALP; ALP kit from Sigma-Aldrich), and mineral
deposits were identified and quantified by alizarin red S staining
(Sigma-Aldrich) on 15-day cultures.
TGF-ß1 degradation by fibroblasts
Human skin fibroblasts (Promocell) were cultured in DMEM
medium containing 10% FBS at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were
seeded and processed in a 6-well plate in the presence or
absence of T06 or an E64-containing protease inhibitor cocktail
(PIC) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) as previously described.(14)
Western blot detection of TGF-b1 and b-actin in fibroblast cell
lysates were performed with human anti-TGF-b1 primary
antibody (G1221, Promega BioSciences, San Luis Obispo, CA,
USA) and anti-b-actin antibody (622102, BioLegend, San Diego,
CA,
USA)
(1:1000
dilution)
incubated
overnight
at
4°C.
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-IgG antibody
(W4018, Promega) (1:2500 dilution) was incubated for 1 hour at
room temperature, and immune-positive bands were visualized
using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) assay kit (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Both super-
natants and cell lysates were also analyzed for TGF-b1 using a
human TGF-b1 ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
Results were expressed as picograms TGF-b1 per total cell
protein (mg) measured by the micro BSA method.
Animals and experimental procedure
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the
ethical guidelines for animals of the Canadian Council on Animal
Care (CCAC) and approved by the University of British Columbia.
Animals were housed in groups of 5 per cage under a 12-hour
light/dark cycle and provided water and food (Mouse Diet 5015,
LabDiet Company, St. Louis, MO, USA). Adult, 3-month-old
female C57BL/6 mice weighing �25 g were used in the study.
Mice were ovariectomized (the procedure is described in the
Supplemental Methods), and after a 2-week recovery period, T06
was given by gavage for the next 3 months. The groups were
shamþvehicle (ovary intact) (n ¼ 10); OVXþvehicle (n ¼ 9);
OVXþ40 mg/kg/d T06 (n ¼ 10). Initial and final body weights
and uterine weights were recorded. At the time of autopsy, the
left femur and the lumbar (L5) vertebrae were dissected and kept
in 70% isopropanol for micro-computed tomography (mCT), and
the right femur and the uterus tissue were preserved in 4%
formaldehyde solution for histology. Blood was collected by
heart puncture and used to determine the plasma concentration
of CTx-1 by ELISA. Plasma levels of calcium and phosphate in
sham, OVX, and OVXþT06-treated mice were determined by
colorimetric assays (Abcam Inc). Plasma levels of albumin and
the collagen synthesis marker P1NP were determined by ELISA
assays (MY BioSource Inc., San Diego, CA). Liver and kidney
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin according to
standard methods to determine structural alterations.
Pharmacokinetic T06 study
Mouse plasma, bone marrow, and lumbar (L5) concentrations of
T06 were determined at 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after oral
dosing of 40 mg/kg. Three female 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice for
each time point were used and samples were analysed by
ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (UHPLC/MS/MS) (Agilent, Mississauga, Ontario,
Canada). Pharmacokinetic analysis of the plasma concentration
data was performed using a non-compartmental analysis (PK
Solutions 2.0, Montrose, CO, USA). The detailed procedure is
described in the supplementary section.
Effect of T06 on uterus and estrogen
At the time of autopsy, mouse uteri were dissected, weighed,
and fixed in 10% formalin. Approximately 5-mm pieces from the
middle of each uterus were dehydrated in ascending grades of
ethanol, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin using
standard protocol. 5-mm sections were cut with a Leica RM 2265
microtome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Represen-
tative transverse sections were obtained with 2.5x and 10x
objectives using a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope. Total uterine
area, total luminal area, and luminal epithelial cell height were

 calculated with Image J software. Mouse plasma estradiol (E2)
and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations
were determined by ELISA kit (MY BioSource Inc.). The assay
sensitivity of E2 was 1 pg/mL and for SHBG 0.03 nmol/L. Free E2
concentrations were measured by fractionating bound and
unbound forms of E2. To determine the bioavailable free E2, we
microfiltrated the plasma (3 KDa cut-off) and determined by
ELISA the E2 concentration in the flow-through and concen-
trated fraction. Before the measurement, the flow-through
fraction that contains the free E2 was concentrated by using a
lyophilizer.
mCT analysis
Ex vivo mCT scanning of the femur and L5 vertebrae was carried
out using a Scanco mCT 100 (Scanco Medical, Bruttisellen,
Switzerland). The bone samples were scanned with a 0.5 mm Al
filter in batches of three at a nominal resolution of 7.4 mm.
A hundred projections were acquired at an 180° angular
range with the special mode width adjusted to full. The X-ray
source was set at 70 kVp and 200 uA at 200 ms integration time.
Reconstruction was carried out using a modified Feldkamp,
David, Kress (FDK) algorithm. Trabecular and cortical regions
were selected by drawing ellipsoid contours. For the trabecular
region, we analyzed 100 slices in the metaphysis region of the
distal femur, distally 40 to 45 slices away from the growth
plate as reference point. Trabecular bone parameters were
assessed for the femur metaphysis and the L5 vertebrae. Cortical
parameters such as cortical thickness (Ct.Th), cortical bone area
(Ct.Ar), and total cross-sectional area (Tt.Ar) were determined by
analyzing 100 continuous slices located at the femoral midshaft
region leaving 200 slices (to exclude the trabecular region) from
the growth plate reference point. Cortical and trabecular BMD of
the femur bone were determined from the region of interest
(ROI) made for the respective region. Hydroxyapatite phantom
rods of 6 mm in diameter with known bone mineral density
(0.25 g/cm3 and 0.79 g/cm3) were used for the calibration. Bone
mineral density for each analysis was determined based on the
linear correlation between the mCT attenuation coefficient and
bone mineral density.(25)
Prevalence of osteoclasts and osteoblasts as evaluated
through CatK and ALP immunoreactivity
Paraffin-embedded bone sections were used for the identifica-
tion of osteoclasts and osteoblasts using the respective
markers, CatK and ALP, as previously described.(26) Briefly, after
deparaffinization, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked
with 0.3% H2O2 for 0.5 hour and blocked with 1% bovine serum
albumin for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were
incubated with anti-CatK rabbit polyclonal antibody (MS4,(26)
1:100) or anti-ALP rabbit polyclonal antibody (antibodies online,
Atlanta, GA, USA; 1:100) overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, sections
were washed with PBS and incubated with biotinylated
anti-rabbit IgG (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) at 1:100 dilution for 1 hour at room
temperature, washed thoroughly with PBS. DAB (3,3’diamino-
benzidine) was used for visualization. Images were captured
using a Nikon Eclipse Ci microscope with 20� and 40�
objectives and analyzed using NIS elements D 4.5 software.
Bone lysates were analysed for ALP in sham, OVX, and
OVXþT06-treated mice by Western blot analysis. Anti-ALP
rabbit
polyclonal
primary
antibody
(1:1000)
and
(HRP)-
conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibody (W4018, Promega)
were used at a 1:2500 dilution. Blots were visualized using
enhanced chemiluminescence and analyzed densitometrically.
Behavioral study
Open field, Y-maze, and Morris water maze tests were performed
as described previously.(27–29) The open field test was performed
to assess general locomotor activity and to provide an
initial screen for anxiety-related behavior in sham, OVX, and
T06-treated mice. The Y-maze test addresses the willingness to
explore new environments. Mice were placed in the center of
the maze, and the number of times and duration of going
into the three Y-arms was recorded. The water maze test was
used to assess related forms of learning and memory. Detailed
methods for these experiments are given in the Supplemental
Methods.
Statistics
All biochemical experiments were performed in 5 independent
experiments. Human and mouse cell-based experiments were
performed in 8 and 6 independent experiments, respectively.
For each osteoclast assay, up to 6 technical replicates were used.
Details of the number of experimental repeats are provided in
the figure legends. One-way ANOVA analysis was used to
determine the effect of T06 compared with their respective
control. In Fig. 2C, nonlinear regression analysis was used to fit
the curves. A p � 0.05 was taken as the significance level.
GraphPad (La Jolla, CA, USA) Prism version 4.01 and Sigma plot
12.0 were used for analysis and statistical tests. Data are
presented as mean � SD.
Results
T06 as an ectosteric site inhibitor
T06 inhibits soluble collagen degradation by human CatK with
an IC50 value of 2.7 � 0.2 mM (Fig. 1A, B). Similarly, the
degradation of insoluble collagen fibers was inhibited by T06
with an IC50 value of 3.6 � 1.7 mM. These IC50 values translate
into molar inhibitor to CatK ratios of 6.7 and 3.6, respectively,
and thus can be interpreted to represent a highly potent
inhibition (CatK concentrations: 0.4 and 1 mM). SEM analyses
revealed no degradation of collagen fibers at a 10-fold excess of
T06 over CatK concentration, which was also corroborated by
hydroxyproline release determination (Fig. 1D, E). In contrast,
the CatK gelatinolytic activity in the presence of T06 was not
inhibited even at a 2500-fold molar excess of the inhibitor
over the protease (Fig. 1C), which confirms the nonactive
site-directed inhibition mechanism of T06. Similarly, the
hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate, Z-FR-MCA, was also
not blocked by T06 at a 2500-fold molar excess (data not shown).
Based on our recent studies where we have identified an
ectosteric site critically involved in the regulation of collagen
degradation,(30) we also analyzed the putative binding sites
of T06 on the hCatK surface using Autodock. The best pose
for the putative ectosteric site binding was ranked 27 and
was in the top 10% of all poses identified (putative Ki ¼ 1.1
mM). The best binding pose is shown in Fig. 1F and depicts
the fit of T06 into the cleft around ectosteric site 1. The
compound shows favorable interactions with the binding
site, including hydrogen bonding interactions with Glu94
and Ser95 and hydrophobic interactions with Tyr87, Pro88,
and Met97.

 T06 inhibits bone resorption activity of human and
mouse osteoclasts
T06 strongly inhibits the bone resorption activity of human and
mouse osteoclasts. Fig. 2A shows TRAcP-stained osteoclasts and
toluidine-stained resorption events on bone surfaces in the
absence and presence of T06 for mouse and human osteoclasts.
In untreated cultures, long, deep trenches and small round pits
were present. T06-treated cultures showed mostly small, round
demineralized pits. Evaluation of the resorption parameters
revealed that 1 mM T06 very effectively reduced the total eroded
surface. However, the metabolic activity and number of
osteclasts were not affected by T06 treatment, suggesting no
toxicity (Fig. 2B). We also determined the concentrations

into the defined cleft of the binding site with the closest interacting residues shown in stick form (green). The compound shows favorable interactions
with the binding site, including hydrogen bonding interactions with Glu94 and Ser95 and hydrophobic interactions with Tyr87, Pro88, and Met97.

 required for obtaining half of their maximal effect on the total
eroded surface. Both mouse and human osteoclast cultures
(Fig. 2C) showed IC50 values for the percent eroded surface/bone
surface of 245 � 55 nM and 237 � 60 nM, respectively, and
percent trench surface/BS of 260 � 54 nM and 241 � 55 nM,
respectively. The reduction in trench and overall eroded
area was also reflected in the reduction of CTx-1, a marker of
CatK-mediated type I collagen degradation,(31) in the culture
supernatants. The reduction was dose-dependent and at
500 nM T06, CTx-1 release was reduced by 60% in mouse and
human osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (Fig. 2D). Similar
IC50 results were obtained with osteoclasts generated from
human blood samples (data not shown). Evaluation of the
resorption pit and trenches revealed that T06 effectively
reduced the resorption depth. This is corroborated with the
reduced calcium release in T06-treated cultures (Supplemental
Fig. S1).
Reversibilty of T06 action on osteoclasts
To determine whether the antiresorptive activity of T06 on
human and mouse osteoclasts is reversible, we performed drug
removal experiments and analyzed the resorption events in
terms of trench surface and total eroded surface formation and
also determined the effect on osteoclast numbers and size
(Fig. 3A–H for human osteoclasts; Supplemental Fig. S2 for
mouse osteoclasts). Trench formation was strongly suppressed
if cells were treated for 4 days with T06. Pit formation, which
reflects the demineralization step in bone resorption,(32) was
slightly increased. When T06 was removed after 2 days, trench
formation reoccurred and reached about 70% of the vehicle-
only treatment. Accordingly, pit numbers were reduced because
they were replaced by trenches (Fig. 3A–E). Neither the addition
nor the removal of T06 had any significant effect on osteoclast
numbers and cell size (Fig. 3F–H).

 T06 effect on osteoclastogenesis
Starting with bone marrow mononuclear cells, osteoclasts
were formed after 10 days of RANKL/M-CSF treatment and
multinucleated cells were counted and their size analyzed by
light microscopy. The presence of 3 mM T06 (12 times the IC50
antiresorptive concentration) in the cell culture had no effect on
osteoclastogenesis for both human and mouse cells. The number
of TRAcP-positive multinucleated cells was statistically indistin-
guishable in the presence or absence of T06 (Fig. 4A, B). TRAcP-
stained and SEM images of individual osteoclasts formed in the
presence or absence of T06 were also indistinguishable (Fig.4C, D).
T06 effect on fibroblast-mediated TGF-ß1 turnover
We have previously shown that the selective CatK inhibitor
odanacatib blocks the degradation of TGF-ß1 in fibroblasts,(14)
which may relate to the observed morphea side effects in clinical
trials of CatK inhibitors.(17) Here we demonstrate that T06 has
neither an effect on the processing of the latent precursor form
nor on the degradation of active TGF-ß1 (Fig. 5A–E). Whereas
in the presence of an inhibitor cocktail, which contains the
cathepsin inhibitor E64, the protein bands for the latent
(�50 kDa) as well as the active TGF-ß1 (12.5 kDa) form increased,
T06 did not alter the concentrations of both forms when
compared with the control lacking any inhibitor. The same
outcome was observed measuring the total TGF-ß1 concentra-
tion by ELISA in cell culture supernatants (Fig. 5D) and cell
extracts (Fig. 5E), indicating that the inhibition of cathepsin
activity blocks intra- and extracellular TGF-ß1 processing and
degradation. At 3 mM of T06 in skin fibroblast cultures, which
equals the 12-fold antiresorptive IC50 concentration in osteoclast
assays, T06 did not reveal fibroblast toxicity (Fig. 5F).
Evaluation of T06 effect in OVX mice
Dosing and pharmacokinetic analysis
Plasma, bone marrow, and lumbar (L5) samples were collected at
0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours. T06 concentrations in plasma
increased during the first 2 hours, reaching a peak value of
59.2 ng/mL. After 2 hours, the drug concentrations decreased
but remained at 4.46 ng/mL at 12 hours, and dropped below the
detection limit at 24 hours. The estimated pharmacokinetic
parameters for plasma were as follows: terminal elimination
half-life (t1/2): 2.00 hours, Tmax: 2.00 hours, Cmax: 59.2 ng/mL,
AUCINF: 373 ng � h/mL, apparent volume of distribution (V/F):
314 mL/g, apparent oral clearance (CL/F):109 mL/h/g, and mean
residence time (MRTINF): 4.98 hours. The peak value of T06
concentration in bone marrow of long bones was 103 ng/mL
with an elimination half-life of 7.43 hours. In lumbar (L5) bone
marrow, the peak concentration was 45 ng/mL and dropped
below detection limit after 8 hours with an observed half-life of
4 hours. Concentrations of T06 in plasma, bone marrow of long
bone, and lumbar (L5) spine at 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours are
shown in Supplemental Fig. S3.
Effect of T06 on body weight, uterine weight, uterine
histomorphometry, plasma estradiol, and general toxicity
T06 treatment to OVX mice was well tolerated for the duration
of 3 months. There were no differences in the body weight

 observed between the T06-treated and untreated OVX mice
(data not shown), and no cross-pathological alterations
were observed in skin and heart tissue (data not shown).
OVX resulted in 75% reduction of the uterine to body
weight ratio compared with the sham group. This ratio
was not different between vehicle-treated OVX and T06-
treated OVX mice (Fig. 6A). Histological analysis of the uteri
showed no difference between T06-treated and untreated
OVX mice, whereas both displayed a significant reduction in
the total uterine area (78%), luminal area (80%), and luminal
epithelial cell height (55%) when compared with the sham
group (Fig. 6B–E). These data suggest that T06 does not
possess any relevant estrogenic activity. T06 had no effect on
total and free estradiol (E2) levels and its major binding
proteins, SHBG and albumin, in plasma as their concen-
trations were the same in T06-treated and untreated OVX
mice (Fig. 6 F–H and Supplemental Fig. S5A). We determined
1.6% to 2.1% free E2 in both OVX and OVXþT06-treated mice.
This excludes a competitive T06 binding to albumin and
SHBG. Therefore, T06 will likely not interfere with the E2
function in mice.
Histological analysis of liver and kidney confirmed no
structural changes in T06-treated mice when compared with
the OVX and sham groups (Supplemental Fig. S5B, C). In addition,
no reduction in the albumin levels confirmed proper liver
function in T06-treated mice when compared with the sham
group (Supplemental Fig. S5A).
Effect of T06 on trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture in
OVX mice
As expected, OVX mice displayed severe osteopenia in the
femoral metaphysis when compared with the sham group.
Post-mortem mCT scans showed a reduction of the bone
volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) ratio by approximately 48%
(Fig. 7A, B). The vehicle-treated OVX group had also reduced
trabecular numbers (Tr.N) (43%; Fig. 7C), trabecular thickness
(Tb.Th) (8%; Fig. 7D), increased trabecular separation (Tr.Sp)
(50%; Fig. 7E), and reduced connective density (Conn.Dn)
(57%; Fig. 7F) when compared with the sham group. The
structure model index (Fig. 7G) was not significantly altered.
Bone mineral density (BMD) was also reduced in OVX mice
(49%; Fig. 7H), and plasma CTx-1 levels, as a marker of
osteoclastic CatK activity, were increased (20%; Fig. 7I). In
contrast, T06-treated OVX mice revealed increased BV/TV, Tb.
N, Tb.Th, and Conn.Dn relative to the vehicle-treated OVX

group (Fig. 7A–I).
Two-dimensional mCT analysis at the site of femur mid-
diaphysis showed a minor decrease in the cortical thickness
(Ct.Th) in vehicle-treated OVX mice relative to the sham group.
Periosteal area (Tt.Ar) and cortical bone area (Ct.Ar) were not
different in sham and vehicle-treated OVX groups (Table 1).
Similar to the femur, L5 vertebrae had severe microarchitecture
erosion due to ovariectomy. The vehicle-treated OVX group
showed a significant fall in bone parameters compared with
the sham group. In comparison to the vehicle-treated OVX
group, T06 treatment had only a minor effect on the L5 bone
architecture, which might be due to the lower bioavailability of
the compound to the vertebrae as shown by the pharmacokinetic
analysis (Table 1).
Effect of T06 on in vivo osteoclast numbers
Immunohistochemial analysis of the bones of sham, OVX,
and OVXþT06 mice showed increased CatK-positive total
osteoclast numbers/bone surface (N.Oc/BS) and osteoclast
numbers/bone perimeter (N.Oc/B.Pm) in OVX and T06-treated
groups compared with the sham group (Fig. 8A–C). Treatment
with 40 mg/kg/d T06 did not have any effect on osteoclast
formation as the number of osteoclasts were similar to
the OVX group. These data suggest that there is no effect of

Western blot analysis for ALP in bone lysate confirmed
increased ALP in expression in OVXþT06-treated mice
compared with OVX littermates (Fig. 9G, H). In line with the
increased osteoblast numbers, plasma P1NP concentrations
increased, reflecting new bone
formation during

treatment (Fig. 9I). The calcium and phosphate levels in
T06-treated and untreated OVX mice compared with the
sham group is shown in Supplemental Fig. S4A, B. No significant
change was observed in all three groups for calcium, whereas
phosphate increased as reported by others in the OVX group
when compared with the sham animals. T06 treatment reduced
the plasma phosphate levels to the concentration found in the
sham group.

 Effect of T06 on mouse behavior
We performed three behavioral tests to evaluate potential
effects of T06 on cognitive functions of mice after 3 months of
treatment. These experiments were justified by earlier findings
that CatK deficiency causes memory and learning deficits.(33) In
the open field test, similar distances covered and similar mean
speeds for the sham, OVX, and OVXþT06 groups were observed.
However, OVX and OVXþT06 mice spent less time exploring the
central open area (�14 seconds) compared with the sham group
(�50 seconds). In the Y-maze test, the percentage of alteration
was not affected, indicating no difference in the explorative
activity between the treatment groups (Supplemental Fig. S6).
The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate any effects
of T06 on long-term spatial memory. Again, no statistical
differences between T06-treated and vehicle-treated mice
were observed. This excludes any significant effects on
cognitive function, including anxiety levels in T06-treated
mice (Supplemental Figs. S6 and S7).
Discussion
At least five highly potent active site-directed reversible CatK
inhibitors (relacatib, balicatib, odanacatib, ONO-5334, and MIV-
711) have been assessed in human clinical trials of osteoporosis
and osteoarthritis.(13) However, the further development of
four of them has been terminated, and only MIV-711 is still being
evaluatedasanosteoarthritisdisease-modifyingdrug.(34)Relacatib
was terminated early on because of drug interaction, balicatib
because of morphea,(17) odanacatib because of increased risks
for stroke, atrial fibrillation, and others, including morphea,(18,35)
and ONO-5334 officially because of market competition, although
dose-response studies also showed the risk for morphea.(19,36)
Becauseall compounds, withthe exception of relacatib, have been
described as highly selective for CatK, it is likely that the adverse
effects are attributable to the direct inhibition of CatK in non-
skeletal tissues. Morphea and atrial fibrillation are fibrosis-related
pathologies,(37,38)andstrokehasbeenlinkedtoatrialfibrillation.(39)

ECTOSTERIC INHIBITOR OF CATK INHIBITS BONE RESORPTION

 Fibrosis by itself is strongly linked to increased TGF-ß1 activity in
these tissues,(40) and we have previously shown that odanacatib
blocks thedegradation ofTGF-ß1in fibroblasts.(14) Thesame is true
forbalicatib(unpublisheddata,DB).Thisstronglysuggeststhatthe
non-skeletal activities and likely non-collagenolytic activities of
CatK contribute to the observed side effects. Therefore, inhibitors
that only selectively inhibit the collagenase activity of CatK would
provide alesssideeffect–prone alternativetothe now-disqualified
active site-directed CatK inhibitors.
We have previously shown that a tanshinone derivative,
DHT1, can selectively block the collagenase activity of CatK
without inhibiting its general protease activity and that this
compound was only 4 times less potent in human osteoclast
assays than ODN.(14) In the present study, we tested Tanshinone
IIA sulfonic sodium (T06), which showed the highest potency
among 31 tested tanshinones in an in vitro collagenase assay
(unpublished data). Our molecular modeling studies revealed a
preferential binding of T06 in an ectosteric site of the L-domain
of CatK (Fig. 1F). This site is remote from the catalytic site and
thus explains why the inhibitor has no effect on the hydrolysis of
synthetic peptide substrates and on the hydrolysis of gelatin.
However, it completely blocked collagen and fibrillar collagen
degradation. The selectivity of T06 as a collagenase inhibitor can
be explained by the prevention of a dimeric CatK complex that is
essential for its collagenase activity.(41) Ectosteric site 1 in CatK is
the dimerization site of its dimer form. The IC50 values for the
inhibition of triple helical type I collagen and collagen fibers
was achieved respectively at a six- and threefold molar excess of
T06 over the CatK concentrations, whereas a 2500-times molar
excess did not show any inhibitory activity for the gelatin
hydrolysis. For comparison, odanacatib inhibited both triple
helical collagen and gelatin hydrolysis at the same inhibitor
concentration.(14)
Evaluating the potency of T06 in human and mouse
osteoclasts showed comparable IC50 values of about 230 to
250 nM and indicated that the ectosteric inhibitor binding site is
identical in both protease orthologues. This is an advantage over
odanacatib and balicatib, which were only specific for human
CatK and thus hampered the use of rodent models for their
preclinical evaluation.(42,43) The potent antiresorptive activity of
T06 was also supported by the finding that the depth of the pits
and trenches was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, which
goes in parallel to the reduction of calcium release. This decrease
in calcium release is correlated with the short-term in vivo
reduction of calcium serum levels when treated with anti-
resorptive such as CatK inhibitors or bisphosphonates.(44,45)
Long-term treatment restores serum calcium concentrations to
normal levels.(45) This is also reflected in the constant calcium
levels in the serum of T06-treated OVX mice when compared
with the sham and OVX-untreated groups (Supplemental
Fig. S4). Thus, T06 does not alter the blood calcium levels,
and a potential risk for hypocalcemia is unwarranted.
Similar to odanacatib,(46) the antiresorptive activity of T06 was
fully reversible, which allows for quick adjustments of the
treatment regimen if needed. Moreover, we did not see any cell
toxicity of T06 at the antiresorptively effective concentration
as the metabolic activity and the number of osteoclasts in
the resorption assays remained unchallenged. It is also highly
relevant that T06 did not interfere with osteoclastogenesis
at the therapeutically effective concentrations. This was
revealed in RANKL-dependent osteoclastogenesis cell experi-
ments and by the fact that the number of osteoclasts in OVX
vehicle- and T06-treated mice was comparable in the evaluated
femur specimens. Structurally related tanshinone derivatives
have previously been suspected to have anti-osteoclastogenesis
effects.(47–49) However, the concentrations used (>30 mM) were
much higher than in our experiments (3 mM in cell assays and
<100 nM maximum plasma and bone marrow concentration in
OVX mice). Avoidance of interfering with osteoclast formation
is considered an advantage because it allows the cross-talk
between osteoclasts and osteoblasts to remain intact, which is
beneficial for the ongoing bone formation.(50)
The efficacy of T06 in OVX mice was revealed by significantly
increased trabecular femur BMD values, improvement in various
bone-morphological parameters, and a reduction in the
plasma CTx-1 values in the treatment group. We observed a
35% increase in BMD and a 20% reduction in plasma CTx-1
concentration. All together, the 40 mg/kg/d oral T06 dose
restored the trabecular bone structure in OVX mice to the level
of the sham group. In addition, increased osteoblast numbers
and level of alkaline phosphatase and P1NP in T06-treated
mice suggested an increased bone formation when compared
with OVX mice. This is an advantage over bisphosphonates,
which lead to a decrease in bone formation due to disrupting
the osteoclast-osteoblast cross-talk.(51) Changes in the femur
diaphysis (cortical bone) were less pronounced, but T06-treated
mice showed significant improvements in cortical thickness.
The least effect of T06 was observed in the lumbar vertebrae
bone, L5. Slight improvements were observed in trabecular
thickness and connective density. It may require longer
treatment periods to see effects at these sites. In addition,
pharmacokinetic results confirmed a lower bioavailability of T06
at the L5 site. However, the measured plasma and femur bone
marrow concentrations of T06 were in the range of the IC50
values determined in in vitro osteoclast-bone resorption assays.
As alluded above, one of the problems leading to the
fibrotic side effects of active-site-directed CatK inhibitors
might be the interference with the homeostasis of TGF-ß1.
These
inhibitors,
including
ODN,
seem
to
prevent
the
regulated turnover of the growth factor.(14) As we have shown
previously, the ectosteric inhibitor DHT1 had no effect on the
extra- and intracellular levels of mature and latent TGF-ß1 in
skin fibroblasts, whereas the presence of ODN increased
both.(14) The same we have demonstrated for T06 in this
report. CatK might be directly involved in both the intra- and
extracellular degradation of TGF-ß1. In support of this is the
finding that fibroblasts secrete mature and pro-CatK into the
culture media, which may explain an extracellular contribution
to TGF-ß1 degradation.(26)
The chemical structure of T06 may suggest some estrogenic
activity, which would be in line with reports on other
tanshinones.(52) However, T06 had no effect on uterine weight,
size, and luminal area at 40 mg/kg/d, which may exclude any
significant estrogenic activity at the in vivo concentration used.
Another concern could be that T06 may compete with the
binding sites of estrogen to its main binding proteins, albumin
and SHBG, which may increase the concentration of free
bioavailable estrogen. Increased estrogen concentrations (free
and total) have been suspected with cardiovascular and breast
cancer risks, although epidemiological evidence seems to be
limited for cardiovascular diseases.(53,54) T06 had no effect on
free and total estrogen blood concentrations and also did not
alter SHBG and albumin plasma concentrations. Moreover, at the
antiresorptive effective concentration of T06, no histological
changes in liver and kidney were observed. This indicates that
T06 is a safe drug with no apparent liver and kidney toxicities

 and no interference with the homeostasis of estrogen and likely
other steroid hormones.
CatK deficiency has been linked to memory and learning
deficits and decreased anxiety levels.(33) This could be a major
concern in long-term drug use because it is typical for
osteoporosis treatment. Using three different learning and
anxiety-related behavior tests, we did not observe any
statistically relevant cognitive impairments after 3 months of
T06 administration. Although this might be too short of a
treatment period, it is reassuring that no effects were observed.
The memory impairment observed in CatK knockout mice might
be related to non-collagenolytic functions of the protease.
Future extended drug treatment experiments will be required,
and they should include active site-directed inhibitors such as
odanacatib as a reference compound.
In conclusion, ectosteric inhibitors such as T06 represent a viable
and safe alternative to active site-directed protease inhibitors,
which have been previously proven efficient antiresorptive CatK
drugs in clinical trials. Ectosteric inhibitors have the proven
potential to be highly effective to inhibit the disease-relevant
collagenase activity of CatK without interfering with its other
regulatory functions and to be efficient in in vivo osteoporosis
models. It should be noted that T06 is one of about 60 tanshinone-
related compounds found in S. miltiorrhiza, alsoknown as Danshen
in traditional Chinese medicine. Danshen is widely used as an
herbal medicine to treat cardiovascular disorders such as
atherosclerosis,stroke,andhyperlipidemia,(55)andskeletaldiseases
such as arthritis and osteoporosis.(20) For example, the herbal
extract is a component in more than 30 herbal prescriptions for the
treatment of osteoporosis where clinical trials have been
reported.(20) A recent study using an herbal formulae containing
S. miltiorrhiza showed antiresorptive efficacy in OVX mice and
rats.(56,57) Our discovery that some of these compounds are
effective ectosteric inhibitors of CatK helps to understand the
molecular mechanism of action of the herbal anti-osteoporotic
efficacy. Our experimental analysis did not reveal any cross-
pathological changes in the T06-treated mice including those
of the skin and heart that were identified as problems in CatK
active site-directed inhibitor-based trials. Our data also reveal
that it is sufficient to only block the collagenase activity of
CatK to exert the desired antiresorptive activity. This is also in
agreement with the pycnodysostosis-causing mutation (Y98C),
which is in the vicinity of the putative T06 binding site. The
Y98C mutant caused the full pycnodysostosis phenotype but
only blocked the collagenase activity without eliminating the
enzyme’s peptide- and gelatin-degrading capability.(58)
