AbsTrACT 
background Poor growth during infancy and childhood 
is a characteristic feature of cystic fibrosis (cF). However, 
the impact of cF on intrauterine growth is unclear. We 
studied the effect of cF on birth weight in Denmark and 
Wales, and assessed whether any associations are due to 
differences in gestational age at birth.
Methods We conducted national registry linkage 
studies in two countries, using data for 2.2 million 
singletons born in Denmark (between 1980 and 2010) 
and Wales (between 1998 and 2015). We used hospital 
inpatient and outpatient data to identify 852 children 
with cF. Using causal mediation methods, we estimated 
the direct and indirect (via gestational age) effect of 
cF on birth weight after adjustment for sex, parity and 
socioeconomic background. We tested the robustness 
of our results by adjusting for additional factors such as 
maternal smoking during pregnancy in subpopulations 
where these data were available.
results Babies with cF were more likely to be born 
preterm and with low birth weight than babies with 
no cF (12.7% vs 5% and 9.4% vs 5.8% preterm; 
11.9% vs 4.2% and 11% vs 5.4% low birth weight 
in Denmark and Wales, respectively). Using causal 
mediation methods, the total effect of cF on birth weight 
was estimated to be −178.8 g (95% ci −225.43 to 
−134.47 g) in the Danish population and −210.08 g 
(95% ci −281.97 to −141.5 g) in the Welsh population. 
about 40% of this effect of cF on birth weight was 
mediated through gestational age.
Conclusions cF significantly impacts on intrauterine 
growth and leads to lower birth weight in babies with 
cF, which is only partially explained by shorter gestation.
InTroduCTIon
Cystic fibrosis (CF) impacts negatively on the 
growth of children. Suboptimal growth is associ-
ated with worse lung function and increased risk of 
premature death in people with CF.1–5 Around the 
time of diagnosis, children with CF are on average 
lighter than non CF children6 and a number of small 
studies have suggested that babies with CF may be 
born lighter than the non-CF population.1 7–14 A 
higher prevalence of preterm birth in babies with 
CF has been suggested as a possible reason,7 13 
whereas other studies have suggested that even in 
babies born at term, those with CF are lighter than 
those without CF1 raising the possibility of prenatal 
and genetic influences on growth. A limitation 
of these studies has been that they have not been 
population-based, and have only captured small 
samples of children with CF from specific regions 
or seen at individual care centres.
In children with CF, as in the general population, 
those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds 
are smaller and lighter compared with children 
from more affluent families, and have worse health 
outcomes and survival. In children with CF these 
associations are evident at diagnosis, and they 
appear to track forward influencing subsequent 
outcomes.15 The socioeconomic differences in early 
growth in children with CF may be a consequence 
of social differences in birth weight in children with 
CF, as well as differential weight loss by socioeco-
nomic status in children with CF prior to diag-
nosis in those that are not diagnosed by new-born 
screening.
In this study, we aimed to clarify the association 
of CF with preterm birth and birth weight, and 
establish whether these associations vary by child-
hood socioeconomic conditions (SECs), at popu-
lation level in Denmark and Wales. We further 
aimed to assess whether any differences in birth 
weight observed were due to differences in gesta-
tional age between babies with CF and babies with 
no CF, or whether there are separate biological 
processes linked to CF that lead to reduced birth 
weight.
Key messages
What is the key question?
 
► Does having cystic fibrosis (CF) impact on birth 
weight and gestational age at birth?
What is the bottom line?
 
► CF has a large effect on birth weight, similar 
to the impact of maternal smoking during 
pregnancy, and is only partially explained by 
shorter gestation, indicating that having CF 
impacts directly on intrauterine growth.
Why read on?
 
► Using record-linked data for 2.2 million babies 
in two countries and modern methods of causal 
mediation analysis, we show that babies with 
CF are born about 200 g lighter than babies 
with no CF, and only around 40% of this effect 
is explained by reduced gestational age.

study design, setting, data sources and participants
We undertook a population-level linkage study of all singleton 
children born in Denmark between 1980 and 2010 and in Wales 
between 1998 and 2015.
In Denmark, we accessed the data from the Danish Medical 
Birth Register16 linked to the Danish National Patient Register 
(DNPR)17 and to data on highest obtained educational level in 
Statistics Denmark for all children and their parents. Linkage 
was based on the Central Person Registry Number.
In Wales, we analysed data from the Secure Anonymised 
Information Linkage databank.18 19 We accessed the National 
Community of Child Health (NCCH) Database and used 
Anonymised Linkage Fields to link to the Congenital Anomaly 
Register and Information Service (CARIS), Patient Episode Data-
base for Wales (PEDW), Welsh Longitudinal General Practice 
data (WLGP), the Annual District Birth Extracts (ADBE—also 
known as the Office of National Statistics birth register) and the 
Welsh Demographics Service Dataset (WDSD).
Multiple births, individuals with missing birth weight, 
gestational age, parity, sex or deprivation score were excluded 
from the analysis. We also excluded individuals with birth 
weight <100 g or >7 kg or gestational age <21 weeks or 
>45 weeks, on the basis that these may be data entry errors. 
See  online supplementary material section S.1 for more 
details.
outcome, exposure and covariates
The main outcomes of interest were birth weight and gestational 
age; and the main exposure of interest was being coded as having 
CF compared with not having CF in the linked administrative 
datasets in each country. Selection of covariates in the analysis 
was informed a priori using a directed acyclic graph (figure 1), 
and this was used to inform similar, but separate, analyses in 
Denmark and Wales based on data availability. Further informa-
tion on the datasets and data cleaning are provided in the online 
supplementary material section S.1.
Danish analysis
In Denmark, CF diagnosis was extracted from the DNPR, 
which includes hospital inpatient and outpatient data, identi-
fied by the  International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 8 code 
273 in years prior to 1994 and ICD 10 code E84 thereafter. 
Birth weight, gestational age, date of birth, sex, parity (from 
1996 onwards), mode of delivery, maternal age at birth and 
maternal smoking (from 1996 onwards) during pregnancy were 
obtained from the Danish Medical Birth Register. A binary vari-
able indicating first-born status was derived from the available 
parity variable post-1996; parity for births prior to 1996 was 
estimated as the number of previous live births and stillbirths, 
which reached gestational age >22 weeks. Additional available 
covariates in Denmark were pre-eclampsia or eclampsia during 
index pregnancy (ICD 8 code 637, ICD 10 code O14 and O15), 
and diabetes during index pregnancy (ICD 8 code 250, ICD 
10 code O24), which were obtained from the DNPR. Highest 
maternal educational level at birth (grouped as International 
Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) levels 1–6 and 
obtained from the Education Register) was used as a measure of 
childhood SECs at birth.
Welsh analysis
In Wales, we obtained information on diagnosis of CF from 
CARIS, PEDW and WLGP
, identified by ICD 10 code E84 and 
READ codes 1264., 66 
k., 66k0., 9No7., C370. We obtained 
birth weight, week of birth of the baby and sex from the ADBE. 
Other covariates in the analysis included a binary variable indi-
cating first-born status (derived from the number of previous live 
births given in NCCH); information on the mother’s smoking 
status in the year previous to birth and the mother’s week of 
birth (through WLGP). The mother’s age at birth was calculated 
as difference in days between week of birth of the baby and week 
of birth of mother divided by 365.25. Deprivation quintiles of 
small area of residence based on the Welsh Index of Multiple 
Deprivation (WIMD) was obtained for the Lower Super Output 
Area (LSOA) of the mother’s postcode from the WDSD and used

as a measure of SECs at birth. The LSOAs from the 2001 census 
were used together with the WIMD scores from 2008.
statistical analysis
We used causal mediation methods20 to estimate the direct effect 
of CF on birth weight after adjustment for gestational age, and 
the indirect effect of CF on birth weight due to any effect on 
gestational age, which in turn influences birth weight (figure 1).
We modelled the joint distribution of birth weight and gesta-
tional age using a two-component mixture of bivariate linear 
regression models for the two countries separately. Finite 
mixture models have previously been used for modelling of 
gestational age and birth weight in order to capture the skewed 
shape of their distributions.21 22 For parameter estimation, we 
factorised the joint distribution into the distribution of gesta-
tional age multiplied by the distribution of birth weight condi-
tional on gestational age.
We initially included CF, sex, parity and socioeconomic status 
as explanatory variables for both gestational age, and birth 
weight conditional on gestational age. The significance of each 
of the covariates was tested by backward elimination based on 
the likelihood ratio criterion with a cut-off for significance of 
p<0.05. The direct effects of CF on birth weight and gestational 
age after adjustment for possible confounders were estimated in 
both subpopulations. The indirect effect of CF on birth weight 
through gestational age was estimated by the product of the 
effect of CF on gestational age and the effect of gestational age 
on birth weight.23 In the context of linear regression models for 
both the outcome and the mediator variable, as is the case here, 
this estimator has been shown to be identical to the average 
causal mediation effect or natural indirect effect if identifiability 
assumptions hold24 25 (see online supplementary material section 
S.6 for the assumptions). We estimated the total effects of CF on 
birth weight in both subpopulations as the sum of the direct and 
indirect effects.24 Effects of CF on birth weight and gestational 
age at a whole population level were estimated as a weighted 
average of the effects in the subpopulations; 95% CIs for all 
effect sizes were estimated by non-parametric bootstrap based 
on 999 samples. We carried out the analysis in R V
.3.3.1 using 
the package FlexMix26 for fitting the models.
robustness tests and additional analyses
We performed multiple sensitivity analyses to assess the robust-
ness of our results. We allowed for interaction terms between 
CF and any of the other covariates and assessed their signifi-
cance using the likelihood ratio test with cut-off for significance 
of p<0.05. We repeated the analyses: allowing for an interac-
tion term between CF and gestational age; and including just 
one child per mother to remove any biases that could be intro-
duced due to correlations between outcomes in children from 
the same mother. In order to assess the influence of unmeasured 
confounders in our main analysis, we repeated our analyses in 
subpopulations in which we have additional data on age of the 
mother at birth and smoking status in the year prior to birth; in 
Denmark, we additionally included data on mode of delivery, 
pre-eclampsia or eclampsia and diabetes during pregnancy. In 
order to assess the impact of potential misclassification of CF 
cases, we repeated the analyses using stricter classification 
criteria for CF. In Denmark, we classified those as CF that had 
a CF code in the DNPR and that had been seen at a hospital 
more than once. In Wales, we selected only those individuals that 
were coded as CF in CARIS. In an additional post hoc analysis 
using our final model, we estimated the probability for a baby 
with CF compared with a baby with no CF to be born with low 
birth weight, since this may also be of clinical interest. See online 
supplementary material section S.8 for details.
ethics and information governance
We use anonymised data in this study, therefore specific ethics 
approval was not needed.

Population characteristics
Figure 2 shows the derivation of the final study populations. 
In Denmark and Wales, 597 out of 1 736 186 and 255 out of 
442 
409 children had CF codes, respectively. The baseline char-
acteristics of both study populations are given in table 1.
In Denmark, 11.9% of the CF population had low birth 
weight (<2.5 
kg) compared with 4.2% in the non-CF popula-
tion; in Wales, 11% compared with 5.4% had low birth weight. 
In Denmark, 12.7% of the CF-coded babies were preterm (<37 
weeks) compared with 5% in the non-CF population. In Wales, 
9.4% of the CF-coded babies were preterm compared with 5.8% 
in the non-CF population. Socioeconomic position, first-born 
status, gender, age of the mother at birth, smoking in the year 
prior to birth, mode of delivery and rates of diabetes and pre-ec-
lampsia were distributed similarly in the CF and non-CF-coded 
populations.
The effect of cystic fibrosis on birth weight and gestational 
age
The estimated whole population effects are discussed in this 
section; for details on the mixture subpopulations and the 
estimated effects at the level of the subpopulations, see online 
supplementary material section S.2 and S.4, respectively. All 
explanatory variables included in the model were significant at 
the 5% level (see online supplementary material section S.3). 
Tables 2 and 3 give the estimated effects of the explanatory 
factors on gestational age and birth weight, respectively.
Findings in the Danish population
In the Danish population, babies with a CF diagnosis were on 
average born about 3 days earlier than babies with no CF (−0.41 
weeks; 95% 
CI −0.55 to −0.25 weeks). Parity and sex had negli-
gible effects on gestational age, whereas gestational age increased 
by about 2 days when comparing babies born to mothers with 
primary education and those born to mothers with second stage 
tertiary education (table 2).
In total, babies with CF in the Danish population were 178.8 
g 
(95% 
CI 134.47 to 225.43 
g) lighter than babies with no CF. 
Approximately 35% of the effect of CF on birth weight was 
mediated by gestational age. First-born and female babies were 
significantly lighter than not first-born and male babies and birth 
weight increased by almost 150 
g when comparing babies from 
mothers with primary education with those born to mothers 
with second stage tertiary education (table 3).
Findings in the Welsh population
In the Welsh population, CF-coded babies were born approxi-
mately 4 days earlier than non-CF-coded babies (−0.57 weeks; 
95% 
CI −0.83 to −0.33 weeks). First-borns were found to be 
born slightly earlier than non-first-borns. Sex had a negligible 
effect on gestational age. The estimated increase in gestational 
age for babies from the least compared with the most deprived 
mothers was <1 
day (see table 2 for details).

CF-coded babies in Wales were estimated to be born 210.08 
g 
(95% 
CI 141.5 to 281.97 
g) lighter than non-CF-coded babies 
with approximately 39% of the effect being due to reduced 
gestation. First-borns and females were significantly lighter 
than non-first-born and male babies. Birth weight increased by 
approximately 115 
g when comparing the most with the least 
deprived quintile of babies (table 3).
robustness tests and additional analyses
Although no interaction effects between CF and any of the covari-
ates were statistically significant (p<0.05), we found that the 
interaction between CF and first-born status was only marginally 
above the threshold level in both populations (see online supple-
mentary material section S.5).
We found a significant interaction term between CF and gesta-
tional age in the birth weight submodel for the Danish popula-
tion. However, the estimated direct and indirect effects of CF 
did not change markedly when this interaction term was intro-
duced (see online supplementary material section S.6 for details). 
Results were similar in analyses including only one baby from 
each mother in both countries (online supplementary material 
section S.7). Repeating the analysis with additional covariates or 
using a stricter definition of CF cases did not markedly change 
our results (online supplementary material section S.7).
On the basis of simulations using our final model, we found 
that the probability for babies with CF to be born with low birth 
weight was between 1.3 and 1.8; and between 1.2 and 2.1 times 
that of babies with no CF in Wales and Denmark, respectively, 
and depended on sex, first-born status, deprivation and gesta-
tional age. The ratio between the probabilities of being born low 
birth weight for babies with  CF and babies with no CF increased 
with increasing gestational age. Being female, first-born or from 
a more deprived area increased the probability of being born 
with low birth weight only slightly and did not significantly 
affect the ratios between babies with CF and babies with no CF. 
See online supplementary material section S.8 for the effect of 
covariate values on the probabilities for a baby with CF to be 
born with low birth weight and the estimated ratios of the prob-
abilities for babies with CF compared with babies with no CF.
dIsCussIon
In a whole population linkage study in Wales and Denmark, 
we showed that babies coded as having CF are born on average 
about 200 
g lighter than babies with no CF. This is a large differ-
ence at a population level, whereby the total effect of CF on 
birth weight is similar to the impact of maternal smoking during 
pregnancy.27 Babies with CF are born on average about half 
a week earlier, but this only accounts for around 40% of the

total effect of CF on birth weight, suggesting a significant direct 
biological impact of CF on intrauterine growth. Babies from 
socially disadvantaged backgrounds are significantly lighter than 
those from more affluent/more educated families, but this effect 
was the same in babies with CF and babies with no CF. Similarly, 
female babies are born significantly lighter than male babies and 
first-borns are born lighter than non-first-borns.
Comparison with other studies
Our large study looking at births from two separate countries 
corroborates previous smaller studies that suggested a differ-
ence in birth weight between babies with CF and babies with no 
CF.1 7–14 Festini et al7 compared perinatal data from 70 children 
with CF in Tuscany, Italy with regional population samples over 
an 11-year period. The authors found that overall babies with 
CF were born 246.2 
g lighter (95% 
CI 129.8 to 362.5 
g) than 
babies with no CF. In babies born at term (>37 
weeks gestation), 
the difference was 205.7 
g (95% 
CI 95.4 to 315.9 
g). In another 
study, Darrah et al1 compared the birth weight of 79 patients 
with CF born at term with pancreatic insufficiency and cared for 
at the Cystic Fibrosis Center at Rainbow Babies and Children’s 
Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio between 1975 and 2005 with the 
national average. In the study population, male babies with CF 
weighed an average 3239.80 
g (SD=367.83 
g, N=40) compared 
with a national average of 3530.20 
g; female babies with CF 
weighed 3142.94 
g (SD=422.75 
g, N=39) compared with a

national average of 3399.19 
g. Recently, Ramos et al13 conducted 
a study in Washington State comparing the birth weight of 170 
babies with CF with that of 3400 babies with no CF matched by 
birth year and born between 1996 and 2013. They found mean 
birth weights of 3031 
g (SD=759 
g) and 3387 g (SD=581 
g) for 
babies with and without CF, respectively. Earlier studies had 
found comparable results.10–12
Our results from Denmark and Wales show that the difference 
in birth weight between babies with CF and babies with no CF is 
about 200 
g, similar to the estimates from these smaller studies. 
We extend these findings to assess the contribution of gestational 
age to explaining these effects. Our study highlights for the 
first time that there is a biological effect of CF on birth weight 
distinct from an impact of CF on gestational age. Different plau-
sible biological explanations have been suggested, one of which 
being an association between cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutation and reduced levels 
of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). This association has been 
demonstrated in CF pig models, with reduced levels of IGF1 
associated with reduced bone length and bone mineral content 
at birth.28 The same study also showed that new-born humans 
with CF also have reduced levels of IGF1. In addition, a study 
in mice with CF found strong correlations between IGF1 levels 
and weight.29 However, the study also showed that growth defi-
ciency in mice with CF was evident late in gestation whereas, in 
contrast to the pig model, IGF1 levels were comparable to those 
in control mice prenatally and at birth but reduced at 3 weeks. It 
is therefore unlikely that reduced IGF1 levels are the sole cause 
for reduced weight at birth in CF. The study was carried out 
using mice with CF as well as gut-corrected mice with CF that 
did not present intestinal obstruction. Results were equivalent 
in both types of mice with CF with similar growth retardation 
compared with control, thus also ruling out a prominent role 
of intestinal obstruction in growth inhibition in mice with CF. 
Further investigation into a possible role of the placenta in 
CF-related growth deficiency showed that although aquaporin 
expression was altered in mice with CF, there was no evidence 
of an effect on placental fluid exchange.29 Further research is 
needed to fully understand the effect of CFTR mutations on 
placental function to assess its involvement in prenatal develop-
ment in CF. Further studies are also needed to assess the impact 
of CF on different aspects of growth, for instance, birth length, 
which is not routinely collected in population registry data.
Clinical implications
More research is needed to assess the prognostic value of birth 
weight for subsequent outcomes in CF. Nutritional status and 
growth in the early years are closely linked to lung function, 
which subsequently influences survival in CF.2–5 In a study of 79 
patients with CF, birth weight has been shown to be associated 
with pulmonary function at age 6 and 10 years with FEV1% at

age 6 increasing by an estimated 1% per additional 100 
g birth 
weight.1
Within the CF study population, we found an average differ-
ence in birth weight of over 100 
g between babies from the least 
and the most deprived families in both Wales and Denmark. 
Children with CF from the most deprived areas in the UK have 
been found to weigh less, be shorter, have a lower body mass 
index, be more likely to have chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
infection and have lower lung function compared with children 
with CF from the least deprived areas.15 Similar results have also 
been found in the USA.30 Our study suggests that these differ-
ences may to some extent be explained by differences in birth 
weight. This indicates that social inequalities in CF outcomes 
may start in the intrauterine period.
strengths and limitations
A key strength is that our study made use of routinely collected 
data, which led to an unselected population-based cohort of 
around 2.2 
million babies with 852 CF cases. A further strength 
is that we were able to carry out the analysis in two countries 
with remarkably consistent findings in both national popu-
lations. A wide range of information is collected in the Welsh 
and Danish registry linkages, allowing us to adjust for a range 
of variables in our analysis. A further strength compared with 
previous studies is that we have used modern methods for causal 
mediation analysis to better understand the role of gestational 
age in the pathway from CF to low birth weight. Misclassifica-
tion of CF cases is a potential limitation of our analysis. CF is 
a lifelong condition that requires intensive healthcare support 
over the patient’s life, and all patients can be expected to receive 
hospital-based care at some point. It is therefore likely that all 
true CF cases are captured in both countries. In Wales, we were 
able to identify cases on the basis of both hospital inpatient and 
outpatient data and general practice records. In addition, a 
universal new-born screening programme was introduced in the 
UK (but not in Denmark) in 2007 leading to early diagnosis of 
CF in Wales and capture in the CARIS dataset. Any misclassifi-
cation of CF cases identified in routine administrative datasets is 
expected to be independent of birth weight and gestational age 
and would, as such, lead to a conservative estimate of the effects 
on birth weight and gestational age. Robustness tests, selecting 
cases most likely to be true CF cases showed similar results to 
our main analysis.
In order to be able to estimate the direct and indirect effects of 
CF on birth weight, we made four assumptions to ensure identi-
fiability of the natural indirect effect (see online supplementary 
material section S.6). If these assumptions do not hold there is 
the potential to introduce bias in the estimated effects, which 
is a well-known problem in causal inference.31 32 In order to 
minimise the risk of biased estimates, we included many of the 
well-established factors that affect birth weight and gestational 
age33 in the analysis and conducted robustness tests in which we 
included further variables that were only available in subsets of 
the study population. Our results did not change, increasing our 
confidence that omission of these variables in the main analysis 
did not affect our findings markedly. However, we were not able 
to adjust for variables such as prepregnancy body mass index, 
and weight gain during pregnancy, which are not collected in 
the registry data that could potentially lead to mediator-out-
come confounding. Similarly, we were not able to adjust for 
ethnicity, which may be a potential confounder and may plau-
sibly modify the relationship between CF and birth weight. The 
non-white populations of both Wales and Denmark are small 
(7% and 10%, respectively) and they may therefore be ill-suited 
to give insights into CF-ethnicity interactions. Since non-white 
ethnicity is associated with worse outcomes in CF,34–36 it may, 
however, be of interest to explore this in future studies in other 
populations. One further point to consider is that gestational 
age is prone to measurement error or interval censoring. This 
may have the effect of reducing the association between gesta-
tional age and birth weight and therefore the indirect effect of 
CF while increasing the direct effect.37 Due to the size of our 
study population, we do not believe that this is a major concern 
in this study; it should, however, be taken into account when 
interpreting the findings.
Implications for research and practice
Birth weight and gestational age are not currently collected in 
most CF registry datasets, including the UK, the US and Danish 
databases. Based on our study results, we recommend the addi-
tion of birth weight to the list of variables collected in CF regis-
tries. This will allow further longitudinal studies to understand 
the association of birth weight with trajectories of nutritional 
status and lung function and its association with survival. Further 
research is also needed to understand the biological mechanisms 
that lead to reduced intrauterine growth in babies with CF 
compared with babies with no CF. Finally, our study has shown 
the merits of data linkage, without which we would not have 
been able to adjust for all the important confounders and iden-
tify the direct and indirect effects. In order to further our under-
standing of disease progression in CF, linkage of CF registries 
to other routinely collected data sources should be considered.
In conclusion, our findings from the analysis of national popu-
lations in Wales and Denmark suggests that CF has a significant 
effect on birth weight, and that this is only partially due to an 
effect on gestational age.
