IMPORTANCE Estimates from claims-based analyses suggest that the incidence of sepsis is
increasing and mortality rates from sepsis are decreasing. However, estimates from claims
data may lack clinical fidelity and can be affected by changing diagnosis and coding practices
over time.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the US national incidence of sepsis and trends using detailed clinical
data from the electronic health record (EHR) systems of diverse hospitals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION Retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted
to 409 academic, community, and federal hospitals from 2009-2014.
EXPOSURES Sepsis was identified using clinical indicators of presumed infection
and concurrent acute organ dysfunction, adapting Third International Consensus
Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) criteria for objective and consistent
EHR-based surveillance.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sepsis incidence, outcomes, and trends from 2009-2014
were calculated using regression models and compared with claims-based estimates using
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for severe
sepsis or septic shock. Case-finding criteria were validated against Sepsis-3 criteria using
medical record reviews.
RESULTS A total of 173 690 sepsis cases (mean age, 66.5 [SD, 15.5] y; 77 660 [42.4%]
women) were identified using clinical criteria among 2 901 019 adults admitted to study
hospitals in 2014 (6.0% incidence). Of these, 26 061 (15.0%) died in the hospital and 10 731
(6.2%) were discharged to hospice. From 2009-2014, sepsis incidence using clinical criteria
was stable (+0.6% relative change/y [95% CI, −2.3% to 3.5%], P = .67) whereas incidence per
claims increased (+10.3%/y [95% CI, 7.2% to 13.3%], P < .001). In-hospital mortality using
clinical criteria declined (−3.3%/y [95% CI, −5.6% to −1.0%], P = .004), but there was no
significant change in the combined outcome of death or discharge to hospice (−1.3%/y [95%
CI, −3.2% to 0.6%], P = .19). In contrast, mortality using claims declined significantly (−7.0%/y
[95% CI, −8.8% to −5.2%], P < .001), as did death or discharge to hospice (−4.5%/y [95% CI,
−6.1% to −2.8%], P < .001). Clinical criteria were more sensitive in identifying sepsis than
claims (69.7% [95% CI, 52.9% to 92.0%] vs 32.3% [95% CI, 24.4% to 43.0%], P < .001), with
comparable positive predictive value (70.4% [95% CI, 64.0% to 76.8%] vs 75.2% [95% CI,
69.8% to 80.6%], P = .23).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In clinical data from 409 hospitals, sepsis was present in 6%
of adult hospitalizations, and in contrast to claims-based analyses, neither the incidence of
sepsis nor the combined outcome of death or discharge to hospice changed significantly
between 2009-2014. The findings also suggest that EHR-based clinical data provide more
objective estimates than claims-based data for sepsis surveillance.

 S
epsis is a major public health problem. It is among the
most expensive conditions treated in US hospitals and
a leading cause of death.1,2 Numerous studies suggest
that the incidence of sepsis is increasing over time, offsetting
declining case-fatality rates.3-6
Despite its importance, reliably measuring sepsis inci-
dence and trends is challenging. Most studies have used claims
data, but increasing clinical awareness, changes in diagnosis
and coding practices, and variable definitions have led to un-
certainty about the accuracy of reported trends as well as
marked heterogeneity in incidence and mortality rates.7-11
Analyses in a limited set of hospitals using clinical data have
alsosuggestedthatsepsisincidenceandoutcomesmaybemore
stable than previously thought.12-14
The increasing use of electronic health record (EHR) sys-
tems allows for the possibility of widespread sepsis surveil-
lance using consistent clinical criteria for concurrent infec-
tion and organ dysfunction rather than claims data. In this
study,ThirdInternationalConsensusDefinitionsforSepsisand
Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) criteria were adapted for public health
surveillance and optimized for applicability across different
EHR systems. This definition was then applied to EHR data
from a diverse set of hospitals to estimate US sepsis incidence
and trends from 2009-2014 and to compare with trends esti-
mated from claims data.
Methods
Study Design, Data Sources, and Population
This was a retrospective cohort study using EHR and adminis-
trative data from 409 academic, community, and federal acute
care hospitals gathered from 7 independent data sets: Brigham
and Women’
s Hospital, Cerner HealthFacts, Emory Health-
care,HospitalCorporationofAmerica,InstituteforHealthMet-
rics, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center health care sys-
tem, and the Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital system (described
further in eMethods 1 in the Supplement). These data sets
were chosen to include a broad mix of hospitals that resemble
all US acute care hospitals in terms of geographic mix, teach-
ing status, and hospital size (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
The study included adults 20 years or older admitted as
inpatients or under observation status or who died in the
emergency department in calendar years 2009-2014. Fixed
categories of race/ethnicity, as reported by patients in the
EHR systems of each health care system, were included to
characterize the generalizability of the study dataset and
because of previously reported associations between race/
ethnicity and sepsis incidence and outcomes.3 The study was
approved with a waiver of informed consent by the institu-
tional review boards at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute,
Partners HealthCare, University of Pittsburgh, Emory Univer-
sity, and Ann Arbor VA.
Sepsis Clinical Surveillance Definition
As per Sepsis-3 criteria, sepsis was defined as concurrent in-
fection and organ dysfunction.15,16 Suspected infection crite-
riaandtheSequentialOrganFailureAssessment(SOFA)score,17
however, were modified to facilitate widespread retrospec-
tive surveillance using routinely collected EHR data (Box). Pre-
sumed serious infections were defined as a blood culture draw
and sustained administration of new antibiotics. Four or more
antibiotic days, including at least 1 intravenous antibiotic, were
required to identify those most likely to have serious infec-
tions and to eliminate patients treated empirically for 48 to 72
hours before culture results were obtained. Fewer than 4 an-
tibiotic days were allowed if death or discharge to hospice or
another acute care hospital occurred before 4 days elapsed.
Sepsis criteria were met if patients had at least 1 concurrent
acute organ dysfunction, defined by initiation of vasopres-
sors or mechanical ventilation, elevated lactate level, or sig-
nificant changes in baseline creatinine level, bilirubin level, or
platelet count. The first antibiotic day and organ dysfunction
were required to occur within ±2 calendar days of the blood
culture draw.
Organ dysfunction thresholds were selected to generally
yield an increase in SOFA score of 2 or more points, to parallel
Sepsis-3 criteria. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was not in-
cluded because it was not measured in most patients and was
variably assessed across hospitals.18 Vital signs were also
not included because they are not available in all EHRs and are
susceptible to transient perturbations and measurement er-
rors. Although not part of the SOFA score, lactate levels of
2.0 mmol/L or greater were included for the analysis of sepsis
incidence,outcomes,andclinicalcharacteristicsin2014,given
the central role of lactate levels in identifying and risk strati-
fying sepsis.19,20 As discussed below, however, the lactate cri-
terion was excluded from the primary trends analysis be-
cause lactate testing rates are rapidly increasing over time and
may thus introduce ascertainment bias.21
Sepsis was defined as hospital onset (vs present on admis-
sion) if infection and organ dysfunction criteria first occurred
on or after hospital day 3. Baseline laboratory values for cre-
atinine, bilirubin, and platelets were estimated using the best
value during hospitalization for infection present on admis-
sion, or best values within ±2 days of the blood culture for hos-
pital-onset infection. The entire hospitalization was consid-
ered a single case of sepsis if surveillance criteria were met
Key Points
Question Is the incidence of sepsis in the United States increasing
and mortality decreasing, as suggested by estimates from
claims-based analyses?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study that included detailed
clinical data from 7 801 624 adult hospitalizations, sepsis incidence
did not change significantly between 2009 and 2014 (+0.6%/y).
While in-hospital mortality decreased during the study period,
the combined outcome of death or discharge to hospice did not
change significantly (−1.3%/y).
Meaning Based on clinical data, the incidence of sepsis, and
related mortality or discharge to hospice, has remained stable
between 2009-2014. The findings also suggest that clinical data
provide more objective estimates than claims-based data for
sepsis surveillance.

 multiple times. Septic shock was defined as presumed seri-
ous infection concurrent with vasopressors and serum lac-
tate level 2.0 mmol/L or greater.
Blood culture draws were used to anchor the primary defi-
nition because they are an important marker of suspected sep-
sis and are relatively simple to identify in EHRs. However, a
sensitivity analysis was performed using any clinical culture
as a broader definition of presumed infection (eAppendix C
intheSupplement).Thesedefinitionsweredevelopedthrough
consensus discussions among the investigative team, in-
formed by prior work using similar approaches.12,14,16,22
Implementation
Case-finding code was created in SAS and SQL and distrib-
uted to partners to execute locally against their EHR data ar-
rayed according to a common data specification (detailed de-
scription provided in eAppendices A-F in the Supplement).
Patient comorbidities were derived from International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM) codes using the Charlson method.23
Validation Using Medical Record Reviews
Study physicians reviewed full text medical records from 510
randomly selected hospitalizations, stratified into those that
did and did not meet EHR sepsis surveillance criteria. These
hospitalizations were drawn from 3 academic centers and 2
community hospitals in Massachusetts and Georgia. Hospi-
talizations were classified by reviewers as sepsis-positive if
therewasdefiniteorpossibleinfectionandanincreaseinSOFA
score by 2 or more points from baseline as a result of infec-
tion, as per Sepsis-3 criteria.15 “Definite infection” required
positive cultures or radiography and a compatible clinical syn-
drome. “Possible infection” required documentation that the
medical team presumed the patient’
s illness was due to infec-
tion, treated for infection, and did not find an alternative eti-
ology. Reviewers were blinded to whether cases were flagged
by EHR surveillance criteria and patients’ICD-9-CM codes
(additional details in eMethods 2 in the Supplement).
Trends
Annual trends in sepsis incidence and in-hospital mortality
from2009-2014werecalculatedinthesubsetofhospitalswith
historical data (at least 84 hospitals per year) (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). In light of rising rates of hospice utilization
nationwide,24 the combined outcome of in-hospital death or
discharge to hospice was also examined to obtain a more com-
plete picture of trends in sepsis outcomes.
An a priori decision was made to exclude the lactate crite-
rionwhenassessingwhethersepsisincidenceandoutcomesare
changing over time. This was done in light of steady increases
in lactate testing rates, which might create ascertainment bias
and inflate perceived changes in sepsis incidence.21,25 How-
ever, a secondary analysis was performed with the lactate cri-
terion to test this hypothesis.
We also applied 2 claims-based definitions: “explicit” ICD-
9-CMcodesforseveresepsis(995.92)andsepticshock(785.52)
and an “implicit” method requiring at least 1 infection code
and 1 organ dysfunction code (Angus method) or explicit codes
for severe sepsis or septic shock.26,27 To examine whether rec-
ognition and coding for sepsis is increasing, we calculated the
annual proportion of hospitalizations flagged by the primary
EHR surveillance definition that also received sepsis codes.
Statistical Analyses
To account for different hospitals contributing data in differ-
ent years, 2009-2014 trends were modeled using generalized
estimating equations to fit Poisson regression models, adjust-
ingforhospitalcharacteristics(institution,region,teachingsta-
tus, bed count, and annual admissions) and case mix (median
ageofhospitalizedpatients,sexandrace/ethnicitydistributions,
andproportionofintensivecareunit[ICU]vstotaladmissions).

1. Presumed serious infection:
• Blood culture obtained (regardless of result), AND
• �4 QADs—starting within ±2 days of blood culture daya
AND
2. Acute organ dysfunction (any 1 of the following criteria within
±2 days of blood culture day):
• Vasopressor initiation (norepinephrine, dopamine, epinephrine,
phenylephrine, or vasopressin)b
• Initiation of mechanical ventilationb
• Doubling in serum creatinine level or decrease by �50%

Revision, Clinical Modification; QAD, qualifying antibiotic day.
a QADs start with the first “new” antibiotic (not given in the prior 2 calendar
days) within the ±2-day period surrounding the day of the blood culture
draw. Subsequent QADs can be different antibiotics as long as the first dose
of each is “new.” Days between administration of the same antibiotic count
as QADs as long as the gap is not more than 1 day. At least 1 of the first 4
QADs must include an intravenous antibiotic. If death or discharge to
another acute care hospital or hospice occurs prior to 4 days, QADs are
required each day until 1 day or less prior to death or discharge.
b Vasopressors and mechanical ventilation are considered to be “initiated”
during the ±2-day period surrounding the day of the blood culture draw
if there were no vasopressors or mechanical ventilation administered
on the prior calendar day.
c For presumed infection present on admission (blood culture day or first
QAD occurring on hospital day 1 or 2), baseline laboratory values are
defined as the best values during hospitalization. For hospital-onset
infection (blood culture day and first QAD occurring on hospital day �3),
baseline laboratory values are defined as the best values during the ±2-day
period surrounding the day of the blood culture draw.
d Serum lactate criterion was excluded from the primary 2009-2014 trends
analysis because of risk of ascertainment bias from increasing rates of
lactate testing over time.

as the exponentiated slope of the line between these 2 years on
the log scale. All percentages were presented as relative annual
changes. VA hospitals were excluded from trends analyses be-
cause only data from 2014 were available.
The national weighted incidence and mortality of sepsis
among hospitalized adults in 2014 was estimated by project-
ing study hospital case counts into stratifications of US hos-
pitals by region, size, and teaching status (eMethods 3 in the
Supplement).
Missing laboratory data for organ dysfunction calcula-
tions were assumed to be normal. Multiple imputation was not
performed because missing data were presumed to be miss-
ing owing to clinical decisions not to order certain tests rather
than missing at random. Data completeness was assessed by
inspecting each data element required for the EHR sepsis defi-
nition on a hospital-by-hospital–level basis and aggregate rates
oforgandysfunctionandsepsisincidenceandoutcomesacross
each dataset (eFigures 1 and 2 in the Supplement).
Continuous variables were expressed as means. Non-
normally distributed variables were expressed as medians of
the medians among the 7 datasets. Analyses were conducted
using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute) and R version 3.3.1
(http://www.r-project.org).Forallanalyses,P < .05(2-sided)was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Sepsis Incidence, Clinical Characteristics,
and Outcomes in 2014
The 2014 study cohort included 2 901 019 adult encounters in
409 hospitals, representing approximately 10% of all US adult
hospitalizations. Study hospitals’ characteristics are re-
ported in Table 1. There were 423 758 patients with presumed
serious infection (14.6% incidence [95% CI, 14.6% to 14.7%),
of which 32 574 (7.7% [95% CI, 7.6% to 7.8%]) died in the hos-
pital. There were 173 690 patients with sepsis (overall hospi-
tal incidence, 6.0% [95% CI, 6.0% to 6.0%]). The clinical char-
acteristics of patients with sepsis are reported in Table 2. Mean
age was 66.5 years (SD, 15.5), and 42.4% (95% CI, 42.2% to
42.6%) were women. Comorbidities were common, includ-
ing diabetes (35.7% [95% CI, 35.5% to 36.0%]), pulmonary dis-
ease (30.9% [95% CI, 30.7% to 31.2%]), renal disease (26.8%
[95% CI, 26.7% to 27.0%]), and cancer (19.7% [95% CI, 19.5%
to 19.9%]). Most sepsis cases (86.8% [95% CI, 86.7% to 87.0%])
were present on admission. Among hospitals (n = 280) for
which culture results were available, 17.2% (95% CI, 17.0% to
17.4%) of patients with sepsis had positive blood cultures.
Of the 173 690 patients with sepsis in study hospitals in
2014, 94 956 (54.7%) required ICU care during hospitaliza-
tion, 27 502 (15.8%) had septic shock, 26 061 (15.0%) died in
the hospital, and 10 731 (6.2%) were discharged to hospice
(Table 2). Median ICU length of stay was 5 days (range, 2-6).
Median hospital length of stay was 10 days (range, 8-12).
Hospital mortality was 25.5% among patients with hospital-
onset sepsis vs 13.4% for patients with sepsis present on ad-
mission (difference, 12.1% [95% CI, 11.5% to 12.7%]; P < .001).
Sepsiswaspresentduringhospitalizationin34.7%ofthe75 079
study patients who died in the hospital in 2014. When adjust-
ing for hospital region, size, and teaching status, the esti-
mated national weighted incidence of sepsis was 5.9% (95%
CI, 5.5% to 6.3%), and the in-hospital mortality rate was 15.6%
(95% CI, 14.8% to 16.5%) (strata-specific counts reported in
eTable 3 in the Supplement). Mortality rates for septic pa-
tients were higher for older patients, men, teaching hospi-
tals, and larger hospitals (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
The distribution of organ dysfunctions, and their associ-
ated mortality rates, are shown in Figure 1. Approximately
50% of patients with sepsis met at least 2 criteria for acute
organ dysfunction.

 Validation
On medical record reviews, EHR surveillance criteria had
69.7% sensitivity (95% CI, 52.9% to 92.0%), 98.1% specificity
(95% CI, 97.7% to 98.5%), 70.4% positive predictive value
(PPV) (95% CI, 64.0% to 76.8%), and 98.0% negative predic-
tive value (95% CI, 95.9% to 99.6%), relative to Sepsis-3 crite-
ria. Explicit sepsis codes had lower sensitivity (32.3% [95% CI,
24.4% to 43.0%] vs 69.7% [95% CI, 52.9% to 92.0%] for EHR
criteria, P < .001) but with comparable PPV (75.2% [95% CI,
69.8% to 80.6%] vs 70.4% [95% CI, 64.0% to 76.8%] for EHR
criteria, P = .23). The combination of explicit or implicit codes
hadcomparablesensitivitycomparedwithEHRcriteria(66.0%
[95% CI, 51.4% to 80.7%], P = .37) but lower PPV (31.0% [95%
CI, 24.9% to 40.4%], P < .001) (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Among the 13 Sepsis-3 cases missed by EHR criteria, the
most common reason was hypoxemia causing an increase in
SOFA score of 2 or more points without need for mechanical
ventilation (eTable 6 in the Supplement). None of these 13 pa-
tients died. There were 57 false-positives flagged by EHR cri-
teria; most were because clinicians initially suspected infec-
tion but medical record reviewers ultimately deemed no
infection was present or because patients’organ dysfunction
did not increase SOFA score by 2 or more points (typically pa-
tientswithelevatedlactatelevelsalone)(eTable7intheSupple-
ment). If sepsis was defined as clinically suspected infection
with organ dysfunction at the thresholds specified by EHR cri-
teria, PPV was 87.9% (95% CI, 82.7% to 92.0%).
Trends From 2009-2014
The trends analysis included 7 801 624 hospitalizations be-
tween 2009-2014 (Figure 2). The annual incidence of sepsis
(without the lactate criterion) was stable (+0.6% relative
change/y [95% CI, −2.3% to 3.5%], P = .67). In-hospital mor-
tality decreased (−3.3%/y [95% CI, −5.6% to −1.0%], P = .004),
but there was no significant change in the combined out-
come of death or discharge to hospice (−1.3%/y [95% CI, −3.2%
to 0.6%], P = .19). Patients with sepsis were increasingly dis-
charged to hospice over time (+6.3%/y [95% CI, 1.1% to 11.6%],
P = .02).
When including lactate as a criterion, sepsis incidence in-
creased (+3.5%/y [95% CI, 0.7% to 6.4%], P = .02), mortality
decreased (−5.0%/y [95% CI, −7.3% to −2.7%], P < .001), and
death or discharge to hospice decreased (−2.0%/y [95% CI,
−3.8% to −0.2%], P = .03).
Sepsis incidence using explicit severe sepsis/septic shock
codesincreasedsignificantly(+10.3%/y[95%CI,7.2%to13.3%],
P < .001),asdidsepsis/septicshockdefinedusingexplicitcodes
or implicit codes (+7.3%/y [95% CI, 5.0% to 9.5%], P < .001).
Mortality declined using explicit codes (−7.0% [95% CI, −8.8%
to −5.2%], P < .001) and explicit or implicit codes combined
(−6.6%/y [95% CI, −8.3% to −4.8%], P < .001). The combined
outcome of death or discharge to hospice also decreased with
explicit codes (−4.5% [95% CI, −6.1% to −2.8%], P < .001) and
withexplicitorimplicitcodescombined(−3.6%[95%CI,−4.9%
to −2.3%], P < .001).
Among patients meeting EHR clinical criteria for sepsis,
the proportion who received explicit sepsis codes increased
from 24.9% in 2009 to 30.5% in 2014 (difference, 5.6% [95%

 CI, 5.1% to 6.1%]; P = .007); the proportion who received im-
plicit or explicit codes increased from 58.1% to 63.7% (differ-
ence, 5.6% [95% CI, 5.0% to 6.2%]; P = .04).
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses restricted to hospitals that reported
data each year from 2009-2014 yielded similar differences in
EHR-based vs claims-based trends (eFigure 3 in the Supple-
ment). When any clinical culture was used to indicate pre-
sumed infection rather than blood cultures alone, sepsis in-
cidence rates in 2014 were higher (7.1% vs 6.0%; difference,
1.1% [95% CI, 1.0% to 1.1%]; P < .001) and mortality rates lower
(14.0% vs 15.0%; difference, 1.0% [95% CI, 0.8% to 1.2%];
P < .001). Clinical characteristics and trends were similar
(eTables 8-9 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this retrospective analysis of more than 2.9 million adults
admitted to 409 US hospitals in 2014, clinical indicators of sep-
sis were present in 6% of hospitalized patients, of whom 21%
died in the hospital or were discharged to hospice. Sepsis was
present in 35% of all hospitalizations that culminated in death.
In contrast to claims-based analyses, sepsis incidence rates
using clinical data were stable from 2009-2014; in-hospital
mortality rates declined, but there was no significant change
in the combined outcome of death or discharge to hospice.
Reliable sepsis surveillance is essential given its high bur-
den, the proliferation of treatment and prevention initia-
tives, and new national sepsis quality measures. Identifying
sepsisusingconsistentclinicalcriteriathroughEHRdata,rather
than relying on explicit clinical diagnoses or hospital coders,
enhancesconfidenceinsepsisestimatesbecausecliniciansun-
derrecognize sepsis and vary widely in their knowledge and
application of sepsis definitions.28-30 Hospitals also vary sig-
nificantlyinhowtheyassigncodesforinfectionandorgandys-
function, and the presence of both of these codes at dis-
chargedoesnotguaranteethattheyoccurredconcurrently.31-33
EHR-based criteria were more sensitive than explicit sepsis
codes on medical record review, with comparable PPV; EHR-
basedcriteriahadsimilarsensitivitytoimplicitorexplicitcodes
combined but higher PPV.
EHR-based clinical surveillance also provides more cred-
ible estimates of sepsis trends compared with claims, which
can be biased by changing diagnosis and coding practices over
time.9,10,13,34 Among patients with sepsis identified using EHR
clinical criteria, there was an increase over time in the propor-
tion assigned explicit and implicit sepsis codes, presumably
reflecting ongoing efforts to improve sepsis awareness, docu-
mentation, and coding. Improving sepsis recognition, includ-
ing less severe cases, likely accounts for the difference in clini-
cal vs claims-based incidence trends as well as the greater
mortality decline seen with claims. The apparent improve-
ment in sepsis-associated mortality was also nullified when
also considering discharge to hospice, underscoring the need
to consider temporal changes in end-of-life care patterns when
assessing trends in clinical outcomes.24
When including elevated lactate levels in the surveillance
definition, mild increases in sepsis incidence and decreases in
mortality or discharge to hospice were observed. This likely re-

Thenationalweightedsepsisincidenceof5.9%amonghos-
pitalized patients and in-hospital mortality of 15.6% estimated
in this study would translate into approximately 1.7 million US
adult sepsis hospitalizations and 270 000 deaths in 2014. This
falls within the wide incidence range of 900 000 to 3.1 million
previouslyestimatedusing4differentclaims-baseddefinitions.7
The observed mortality rate exceeds the 10% mortality re-
ported in the Sepsis-3 derivation and validation studies.16 This
may reflect the more stringent definition of presumed infec-
tion (requiring blood cultures and ≥4 days of antibiotics rather
than a single dose) and SOFA score adaptations.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of the current study include the use of detailed clini-
cal data from a large number of diverse hospitals that to-
gether account for approximately 10% of all US acute care hos-
pitalizations in 2014. The data sets came from unrelated
hospital networks, limiting the possibility of bias from idio-
syncratic clinical, diagnosis, or coding patterns. A sensitivity
analysis using a broader definition of presumed infection dem-
onstrated relatively little change in sepsis incidence and out-
comes and no difference in trends, supporting the robust-
ness of the primary definition.
This study also has several limitations. First, EHR-based
surveillance may be affected by differences in clinical prac-
tice between clinicians and hospitals as well as changes over
time. This may be most evident with rising rates of lactate test-
ing, but earlier initiation of vasopressors for hypotension and
increasing use of noninvasive ventilation and high-flow
nasal cannulas for respiratory failure could also affect esti-
mates. The partial dependence on clinician-initiated interven-
tions to measure organ dysfunction, however, is also a limi-
tation of the SOFA score and thus the Sepsis-3 criteria.
Second, only adults in US acute care hospitals were in-
cluded; future studies should address sepsis in neonates and
children,aswellasconsiderwaystoidentifysepsisoutsidehos-
pitals and in countries without widespread EHR systems.
Third,notallhospitalscontributeddataeachyearfortrends
analyses. However, regression models were used to adjust for
hospital-level differences.
Fourth, the study did not directly ascertain sepsis mortal-
ity that occurs after hospital discharge.
Fifth, medical record reviews were only conducted on
a fraction of the study cohort. Cases were drawn from both
academic and community hospitals, but they still may not be
representative of all hospitals.

 Sixth, the study dataset might not be representative of na-
tional data. However, study hospitals had characteristics simi-
lar to those of US hospitals overall and represented a substan-
tial fraction of total admissions nationwide.
Seventh, medical record reviews suggest that EHR-based
surveillance may miss up to 30% of patients with sepsis while
misclassifying another 30%. Quantifying the accuracy of sep-
sis criteria is elusive, however, because there is no true gold
standard for sepsis.30,39,40 Recognizing this problem, the Sep-
sis-3 task force developed and validated criteria based on as-
sociations with adverse outcomes.15,16 The EHR surveillance
definition in this study carried high mortality rates (15%) com-
pared with all encounters with presumed infection (8%), and
mortality increased with increasing numbers of dysfunc-
tional organs. On medical record reviews, the Sepsis-3 cases
missed by EHR surveillance involved mild organ dysfunc-
tion, such as hypoxemia without need for mechanical venti-
lation, and no patients in that group died. False-positives were
most often attributable to reviewers adjudicating the ab-
sence of infection despite patients receiving blood culture
draws and antibiotics, or a noninfectious cause of organ dys-
function. When sepsis was defined as organ dysfunction con-
current with clinically suspected infection (as is common in
practice), PPV of the surveillance definition increased to 88%.
Eighth, neither Sepsis-3 criteria nor EHR-based clinical
surveillance can solve the challenge that clinicians routinely
face in deciding whether their patient is infected and
whether organ dysfunction is due to infection. Instead, EHR
surveillance provides a consistent gauge to estimate sepsis
incidence and outcomes using readily available, objective
clinical data. This method cannot help clinicians identify
sepsis at the bedside since it is retrospective, but it may be
useful for public health surveillance, hospital evaluation,
and assessing the effects of quality improvement efforts.
EHR-based surveillance may further support these objec-
tives by facilitating granular evaluation of the timing of sep-
sis onset and interventions.
Conclusions
In clinical data from 409 hospitals, sepsis was present in 6%
ofadulthospitalizations,andincontrasttoclaims-basedanaly-
ses, neither the incidence of sepsis nor the combined out-
come of death or discharge to hospice changed significantly
between 2009-2014. The findings also suggest that EHR-
based clinical data provide more objective estimates than
claims-based data for sepsis surveillance.
