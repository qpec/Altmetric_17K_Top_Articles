Abstract
Background—Depression is the most common form of mental disorder in community and 
health care settings and current treatments are far from satisfactory. Vagus nerve stimulation 
(VNS) is an FDA-approved somatic treatment for treatment-resistant depression. However, the 
involvement of surgery has limited VNS only to patients who have failed to respond to multiple 
treatment options. Transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) is a relatively new, non-invasive VNS method 
based on the rationale that there is afferent / efferent vagus nerve distribution on the surface of the 
ear. The safe and low-cost characteristics of tVNS have the potential to significantly expand the 
clinical application of VNS.

 Methods—In this study, we investigated how tVNS can modulate the default mode network 
(DMN) functional connectivity (FC) in mild or moderate major depressive disorder (MDD) 
patients. Forty-nine MDD patients were recruited, and received tVNS or sham tVNS (stVNS) 
treatments.
Result—34 patients completed the study and were included in data analysis. After one month of 
tVNS treatment, the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score reduced 
significantly in the tVNS group as compared to the stVNS group. The FC between the DMN and 
anterior insula and parahippocampus decreased; the FC between the DMN and precuneus and 
orbital prefrontal cortex increased compared to stVNS. All these FC increases are also associated 
with HAMD reduction.
Conclusions—tVNS can significantly modulate the DMN FC of MDD patients; our results 
provide insights to elucidate the brain mechanism of tVNS treatment for MDD patients.

Introduction
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide (1), 
and is projected to become the second leading cause of disability worldwide by the year 
2020 (2-3). Despite the critical need, current treatments for these disorders are far from 
satisfactory due to high non-response rate to treatments, high relapse rates, and frequent 
intolerable side effects (1, 3).
Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a relatively new FDA-approved somatic treatment for 
treatment-resistant depression (TRD) that can produce significant and clinically meaningful 
antidepressant effects (1, 4-6). However, the involvement of surgery, perioperative risks, and 
potentially significant side effects have limited this treatment to patients who have been 
treated for depression in the past but have failed to respond to at least 4 prescribed 
medications and/or established somatic treatment options such as electroconvulsive therapy 
for MDD (7).
To overcome the potential barriers of applying VNS, a non-invasive VNS method, 
transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has been developed. The rationale for using 
tVNS on the ear is based on anatomical studies that suggest the ear is the only place on the 
surface of the human body where there is afferent vagus nerve distribution (8-9). Thus, 
direct stimulation of the afferent nerve fibers on the ear should produce an effect similar to 
classic VNS in reducing depressive symptoms, but without the burden of surgical 
intervention (10-11). In past years, tVNS has been applied to treat MDD (10) and other 
disorders such as epilepsy (12-13), and pre-diabetes (14). Yet, the underlying mechanism of 
tVNS remains unclear.
In past decades, with the aid of brain imaging tools, accumulating evidence has 
demonstrated that MDD is associated with structural and functional abnormalities in brain

 circuits involved in emotional processing, self-representation, reward, and external stimulus 
(stress, distress) interactions (15-22); these brain regions include the hippocampus, 
amygdala, anterior cingulated cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, these brain 
regions also fall within the default mode network (DMN), a brain network believed to be 
involved in self-referential processing, affective cognition, and emotion regulation (23-24).
Thus, the DMN functional connectivity has drawn investigators’ attention in MDD research 
(25-29). Studies (30-36) found DMN functional connectivity changes in MDD patients, and 
these changes are associated with psychiatric measurements, such as rumination score, in 
MDD patients. For instance, studies (26, 30) have found increased functional connectivity of 
DMN with the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC) in MDD patients. After 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation treatment, the abnormal increase in functional 
connectivity of DMN and sACC was reduced (34). These studies demonstrated that the FC 
of DMN can be a useful tool in understanding the underlying mechanism of MDD treatment.
In this study, we investigated the resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) changes after 
the longitudinal tVNS as compared with sham tVNS (stVNS) in patients with mild or 
moderate depressive symptoms. We hypothesize that the longitudinal tVNS may 
significantly modulate the rsFC of DMN and reduce symptoms in MDD patients.
Methods and design
Study population
Forty-nine patients with mild or moderate MDD were recruited for the trial. ICD-10 
Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders was used for diagnosis of MDD. Patients 
who voluntarily provided informed consent and met inclusion/exclusion criteria were 
enrolled in this study.
Inclusion criteria included: 1) Patient meets ICD-10 diagnosis standard: mild (2 typical + 2 
other core symptoms), moderate (2 typical + 3 other core symptoms); 2) Patient is 16-70 
years of age; 3) Patient stopped taking anti-depressive medication or other psychiatric 
medications 2 weeks before the intervention started; 4) Patient has a junior high school 
education and can understand the scales; 5) Patient has exhibited symptoms for at least 2 
months, but no longer than 2 years.
Exclusion criteria included: 1) Patients with current addiction to drugs; 2) Patients with 
severe depression or suicidal thoughts; 3) Patients with other severe organic diseases, such 
as severe heart disease, kidney failure etc; 4) Patients who did not agree to sign the consent 
form.
Recruitment procedures
All patients were recruited using advertisements and by sending flyers to the four hospitals 
involved in the study. In this study, tVNS was the only treatment the patients received. Due 
to safety concerns and to increase the homogeneity of the study, we decided to include only 
patients with mild or moderate depressive symptoms. After passing a pre-screening, 
potentially eligible patients provided informed consent in the presence of a study physician.

 We used a single blinded clinical trial to investigate the antidepressant effect of solo tVNS 
treatment. The first cohort all received tVNS. After demonstrating the effect of tVNS, we 
recruited the second cohort of patients who received four weeks of sham tVNS as a control 
in this study.
Intervention
After group randomization, all patients were trained to use the tVNS or stVNS device to 
apply stimulation. All subsequent treatments were self-administered by the patients at home. 
Patients were also instructed to complete a patient diary booklet each day to describe any 
side effects corresponding with or temporally related to treatment. The investigators checked 
all booklets at the 4-week assessments. All procedures performed in the stVNS treatment 
group were identical to the procedures for the tVNS group.
tVNS treatment
Location—The points for tVNS are located in the auricular concha area where there are 
rich vagus nerve branch distributions (Figure 1).
Intervention procedure—Patients took a seated position or lay on their side. After the 
stimulation points were disinfected according to standard practice, ear clips were attached to 
the ear area (auricular concha) at the stimulation site. Stimulation parameters included: 1) 
density wave adjusted to 20Hz, with a wave width less than 1ms, and 2) intensity adjusted 
based on the tolerance of the patient (~ 4-6 mA). Each treatment lasted 30 minutes and was 
carried out twice a day, at least 5 days per week for the duration of the treatment period (4 
weeks).
StVNS treatment
Location—The stimulation points for stVNS are located at the superior scapha (outer ear 
margin midpoint) where there is no vagus nerve distribution (Figure 1).
Since all treatments were self-administered by the MDD patients, all patients were required 
to complete daily entries in a diary that was checked during assessments (at the end of the 
week 4) to enhance compliance.
Clinical outcomes and statistical analysis
All endpoints were measured at week 0 and week 4. The primary endpoint is the 24-item 
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). The secondary endpoints included the 
Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-Rating 
Depression Scale (SDS).
Our analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. Statistical analysis was 
performed using SPSS 19.0 Software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Repeated 
measurements were applied to compare primary and secondary outcomes. Age and gender 
were also included in the model as covariates.

 fMRI Data acquisition and analysis
Each subject participated in identical fMRI scanning sessions before and after one month of 
treatment. The fMRI brain imaging acquisition was conducted on a 1.5 Tesla GE Signa MRI 
system equipped with the standard two channels’ Birdcage head coil. T1-weighted high-
resolution structural images were acquired with the 3DFSPGR sequence (matrix 192 × 256, 
FOV 200 mm, flip angle 15 degree, slice thickness 1.4 mm). T2-weighted functional images 
encompassing the whole brain were acquired with the gradient echo EPI sequence (TE 30 
ms, TR 2500 ms, matrix 64 × 64, FOV 240 mm, flip angle 90 degree, slice thickness 3.0 
mm, gap 0.5 mm, 41 slices, paralleled by AC-PC line). Image collection was preceded by 4 
dummy scans to allow for equilibration of the MRI signal. Two six-minute resting state 
fMRI scans were applied while the subjects were required to keep their eyes open.
We analyzed pre- and post-treatment resting state data using Independent Component 
Analysis in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) (37-40). We first applied a band pass filter 
between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz to the functional time series, and then corrected for motion using 
MCFLIRT. We corrected slice timing and stripped the skull using the Brain Extraction Tool 
(BET), and smoothed it (full width at half maximum = 5 mm). Next, we registered the 
functional data to their respective skull stripped anatomical volume and further registered it 
to the MNI152 template using linear affine transformations with 12 degrees of freedom. We 
then concatenated the functional data into 4D data and performed a probabilistic 
independent component analysis using MELODIC (Multivariate Exploratory Linear 
Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components) (41) on the data set to identify 20 
resting state networks. Using an algorithm, we searched for similarities between the default 
mode network (DMN) in our group-level networks and the template networks derived from 
1414 healthy subjects to identify the corresponding network for our results (38).
Then, dual-regression was applied (38). Using the previously defined DMN as spatial 
regressors in a general linear model (GLM), we were able to extract the temporal dynamics 
associated with each spatial map. The resulting time courses served as temporal regressors in 
a GLM to generate subject-specific-maps of the whole brain for each subject. Finally, group 
analyses were performed using the whole-brain subject-specific network maps from the 
second GLM. The results represent the strength of FC for each voxel within the DMN.
To investigate the modulation effect of tVNS treatment, we compared the changes after 
treatment (post-pre) in the tVNS group to that of the stVNS group. To explore the 
association between the clinical outcomes and FC changes, we performed regression 
analyses using the network connectivity “change maps” between post- and pre-treatment and 
corresponding changes in clinical outcomes. For both analyses, age, gender were included in 
the model as non-interest covariates. To further control the potential residual effect of head 
motion, we also include average head motion difference (post-pre) for each individual as 
covariate during analysis (42). A threshold of voxel-wise Z > 2.6 and a corrected cluster 
significance threshold of P < 0.05 with more than 20 contiguous voxels was applied in data 
analysis.

 Results
Out of 49 subjects (27 in the VNS group, 22 in the control group) recruited into the study, 35 
patients (19 in VNS group, 16 in control group) completed the two fMRI scans (0 and 4 
weeks). Out of 8 patients who dropped out in the VNS group, 4 dropped due to loss of 
contact, 3 due to disinterest, and 1 due to a scheduling conflict. Of the 7 patients who 
dropped out in the stVNS group, 3 dropped due to scheduling conflicts, 3 due to disinterest, 
and 1 due to poor data quality. There was no statistical difference in dropout rate between 
the two groups.
Of 35 subjects who completed the study, we excluded one additional subject in the tVNS 
group due to large head motion during data analysis. Of the 34 patients left for data analysis, 
there was no significant difference on head motion pre- and post-treatment between two 
groups (p = 0.89 and 0.95 between the tVNS and stVNS groups using two sample t-test).
Baseline characteristics of the two groups were shown in Supplementary Table 1. There was 
no significant difference between the two groups in age, gender, HAMD, HAMA, SDS and 
SAS at the beginning of the treatment.
The clinical outcome measurements of pre- and post-treatment are shown in Table 1. 
Repeated measurements showed that there was significant interaction between the treatment 
group (tVNS and stVNS) and treatment time (pre- and post-treatment) on all measured 
clinical outcomes (HAMD, p = 0.002; SAS: P = 0.013; SDS P =0.012) except HAMA, 
which showed a marginal significant difference (P =0.053). In addition, we also found a 
significant main effect of treatment time point (pre > post-treatment) in SDS (p = 0.019).
fMRI result
The DMN obtained from ICA analysis is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. The network is 
consistent with previously published results (38). Brain regions observed in the network 
include the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), precuneus, 
posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and the bilateral parietal cortex.
The comparison on the post- and pre-treatment differences between the two groups showed 
that after treatment, patients in the tVNS group, as compared with patients in the stVNS 
group (tVNS > stVNS), showed significant FC differences between the DMN and the 
following regions: the bilateral fusiform gyrus and thalamus; the left orbital prefrontal cortex 
(OPFC), precuneus, temporoparietal junction; the right superior prefrontal cortex, dorsal 
lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), middle temporal gyrus, and parahippocampus 
(Supplementary Table 2, Figure 2).
The opposite comparison (stVNS > tVNS) showed significant FC differences between the 
DMN and the bilateral operculum and occipital cortex, left medial prefrontal cortex 
(MPFC), superior temporal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, occipitotemporal gyrus; right insula, 
parahippocampus / hippocampus, and inferior parietal lobule (Supplementary Table 2, 
Figure 3).

 Regression analysis showed a positive association between the depression severity change as 
measured by HAMD (post- vs pre-treatment) score and the corresponding FC changes 
between the DMN and the left OPFC, middle occipital gyrus, right operculum, anterior 
insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), inferior parietal lobule, inferior temporal 
gyrus, and cuneus (Supplementary Table 3 and Figure 2). A negative association between 
the depression severity change as measured by HAMD (post- vs pre-treatment) and the 
corresponding FC changes between the DMN and the bilateral DLPFC, fusiform, left 
MPFC, operculum, insula, temporoparietal junction, the right OPFC, rostral anterior 
cingulate cortex (rACC), precuneus, the middle temporal gyrus, and parahippocampus 
(Table 3 and Figure 3). The brain regions of the OPFC and precuneus overlap with the 
contrast comparing tVNS and stVNS (tVNS > stVNS) (Figure 3)
Discussions
In this study, we investigated the DMN rsFC changes before and after one month of tVNS 
treatment as compared with stVNS. The results showed that the HAMD and other clinical 
outcomes significantly decreased in the tVNS group as compared with stVNS. Further, we 
found tVNS can significantly modulate the rsFC of DMN in brain regions associated with 
emotion and affect. The rsFC changes in the DMN are also significantly associated with the 
MDD severity changes as indicated by HAMD score, implying that tVNS may achieve the 
treatment effect by modulating the FC of the DMN.
In a previous pilot study (10), Hein and colleagues investigated the short- term (2 weeks) 
therapeutic effect of taVNS patients suffering from major depression using an add-on 
design. They found that taVNS can significantly reduce the Beck Depression index (BDI) as 
compared with the sham condition. But there is no significant difference on the HAMD. In 
this study, tVNS could not only reduce HAMD and SDS, but also reduce the anxiety 
symptoms in these patients as indicated by SAS and HAMA (marginally significant) in 
comparison with stVNS at week 4. These results suggest that tVNS may also be extended to 
anxiety disorders in the future.
Interestingly, we found that the symptoms in the stVNS group also showed a significant 
decrease after treatment (HAMD p = 0.002, HAMA p = 0.001, SDS p = 0.03 using paired t-
test to compare pre- and post-treatment outcomes). We speculate that this reflects the 
placebo effect produced by stVNS. The large placebo effect observed in our study is 
consistent with findings from previous clinical trials testing the efficacy of antidepressants 
(43).
MDD is a common and complex disease with unknown pathogenesis (21, 44). The 
monoamine hypothesis proposes that low levels of brain monoamines, such as serotonin, 
noradrenaline and dopamine, are responsible for the development of MDD (21, 44). 
Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested that cholinergic system is also involved in 
pathophysiology of depressive disorder (44-45). Specifically, it was believed that MDD 
derived from interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors, which further caused 
high susceptibility to stress. Both chronic stress and depression are associated with 
cholinergic dysfunctions and structural and functional alterations in brain areas including the

 hippocampus, PFC and amygdala, which account for development of the cognitive 
symptoms of depression, such as attention deficit, memory impairment and negativity bias 
(44). Based on regional glucose metabolism in MDD patients, Merberg posed a limbic-
cortical dysregulation model (46-47). Based on the model, MDD are associated with 
metabolism decreases in dorsal limbic (anterior and posterior cingulate) and neocortical 
regions (prefrontal, premotor, parietal cortex) and relative increases in ventral paralimbic 
areas (subgenual cingulate, anterior insula, hypothalamus, caudate). MDD remission 
requires the inhibition of overactive ventral areas and disinhibition of underactive dorsal 
regions.
Despite the clinical application of VNS / tVNS for MDD patients, its underlying mechanism 
is not fully understood (3, 48-49). Hypotheses are based on the impact of anatomy and 
function / neurotransmitter changes evoked by VNS / tVNS in mood control (50). The vagus 
nerve is a mixed nerve composed of about 80% afferent fibers. It is speculated that the 
antidepressant effects of VNS are partially attributed to the projection of afferent fibers to 
the nucleus tractus solitaries, which is further connected directly and indirectly with brain 
structures including the reticular formation in the amygdala, hypothalamus, insula, thalamus, 
orbitofrontal cortex, and other limbic regions responsible for mood and anxiety regulation 
(51-54). Interestingly, some of these brain regions are also believed to be involved in the 
pathogenesis and remission of MDD (44-47), which builds a basis for treatment with NVS. 
In addition, both clinical and animal studies indicate that VNS can produce changes of 
neurotransmitters implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD (55), including serotonin (56), 
norepinephrine (57), GABA, and glutamate (58).
The DMN is a network of brain regions that are active when the individual is not focused on 
the outside world and the brain is at wakeful rest. Previous studies have suggested that the 
DMN is associated with the self-referential system, affective cognition, and emotion 
regulation (25-26, 29). MDD patients are characterized by increase in self-focus and stress-
sensitivity (59). Thus, accumulating evidence indicates that the DMN plays an important 
role in neuropathology of MDD (30-36, 60-62).
Recently, brain imaging tools have been applied to investigate the fMRI signal change 
evoked by tVNS (63-65). In an early study, Kraus and colleagues (63) found that robust 
tVNS can induce fMRI signal decreases in limbic brain areas, including the amygdala, 
hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and middle and superior temporal gyrus, as well as an 
fMRI signal increase in the insula, precentral gyrus and thalamus. Psychometric assessment 
revealed a significant improvement in well-being after tVNS. The control intervention 
(earlobe stimulation) did not show similar fMRI or psychometric effects. In a follow-up 
study (65), the authors also studied the anterior wall and posterior wall auditory canal 
separately. The results showed that stimulation of the anterior wall evoked significant limbic 
deactivation at the parahippocampal gyrus and the posterior cingulate cortex, as well as 
other regions including the thalamus, locus coeruleus and solitary tract.
Consistent with the above brain imaging studies (63-65) that focus on the immediate brain 
response during tVNS, we found that after one month of tVNS treatment, the FC between 
the DMN and right anterior insula, and parahippocampus significantly decreased.

 Anterior insula belong to a salience network, which is involved in detecting and orienting to 
both external and internal salient stimuli and events (66-67). Investigators believe that the 
anterior insula is critical in maintaining and updating representations of current and 
predictive salience (66, 68). Previous studies have suggested that the right anterior insula is 
involved in responses to salient stimuli via switching between the DMN-related self-
referential network and executive network related to goal directed activities (66, 69).
The parahippocampus is a key region in the limbic system. Sheline and colleagues (70) 
showed that depressed subjects looking at negative pictures elicited a significantly greater 
increase in activity in the parahippocampus and hippocampus than control subjects. Dillon 
and colleagues (71) found that controls, not MDD patients, showed a stronger encoding 
response to reward tokens in the parahippocampus and the dopaminergic midbrain. They 
hypothesized that the weaker memory for positive material in MDD patients reflects blunted 
encoding responses in the dopaminergic midbrain and medial temporal lobes in MDD 
patients.
We also found that after tVNS treatment, the FC between the DMN and left precuneus, and 
the OPFC increased compared with stVNS. Furthermore, the DMN FC increase in these 
regions is also associated with the depression severity of the patients.
In a previous study, Li and colleagues (61) studied DMN resting state FC difference between 
MDD patients and healthy control subjects as well as the treatment effects of an 
antidepressant drug. They found that the FC between the posterior default mode subnetwork 
(similar to the DMN pattern derived from ICA in our study) and posterior cingulate cortex 
(PCC) were normalized (decreased) after antidepressant treatment. In our study, we found 
that the FC between the DMN and precuneus increased after tVNS stimulation, and the 
increase in FC is also associated with the depression severity reduction. This inconsistency 
may be due to different treatment modalities (61, 72).
In this study, we found that the increase of DMN FC with the rostral ACC and MPFC is 
associated with a reduction in depression severity. This is consistent with results from a 
recent study on the treatment effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation in depression (34). 
These results also provide direct support to the hypothesis (18, 47, 73), which suggests that 
the rACC / MPFC plays an important role in MDD treatment.
We found the DMN and OPFC FC increased after tVNS treatment. This increase is 
associated with depression severity reduction. The OPFC is connected to neuroanatomical 
structures directly involved in emotional and executive processing, such as the hippocampal 
formation, amygdala, ventral striatum, anterior cingulate, hypothalamus and medial 
temporal areas (74-76). Interestingly, we observed significant FC changes between the DMN 
and brain regions such as the parahippocampus, ACC, and medial temporal areas. These 
results suggest that the modulation of tVNS is not targeted to one particular region, but 
rather can influence brain region networks associated with emotion / affect regulation. This 
result is consistent with the brain imaging studies during VNS / tVNS that found activity 
changes in multiple brain regions (55, 63-65). Particularly, our study demonstrated that after 
longitudinal treatment, the FC between the DMN and some key regions in VNS pathways

 and mood regulation were significantly modified, and some of the FC changes are associated 
with depression symptom relief.
There are several limitations in this study. First, this is not a randomized clinical trial. We 
used this strategy mainly due to ethical concerns. As the first study to use tVNS alone on 
patients suffering from mild and moderate depression, we thought it would be wise to test 
the effectiveness of tVNS first. After demonstrating that tVNS could significantly reduce 
patients’ symptoms, we recruited a second cohort of patients to test if the treatment effect of 
tVNS was greater than that of the sham tVNS. Since the baseline characteristics were similar 
in two cohorts of patients, and the study is completed within one year, we do not expect the 
design will influence the validity of this study. Nevertheless, a randomized clinical trial is 
needed in the future.
Secondly, treatments in the study were self-administered by the MDD patients, and thus 
patient compliance may have influenced the observed results. To enhance compliance, all 
patients were required to complete daily entries in a diary that was checked during 
assessments. Nevertheless, this self-administration method provides direct evidence toward 
the feasibility of widespread application of the method used within the study, which could 
significantly reduce treatment expenses. Thirdly, the treatment was only four weeks in 
duration; hence, the results obtained only represent the short to mid-term effects. Further 
study is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of this treatment option. Also, objectively 
control of the tVNS application (e.g. recording of the quantity or load of applied impulses) 
was not included, which prevents us from calculate dose-response relationships. Finally, the 
sample size is relatively small, and further study with a larger sample size is needed to 
replicate our study findings.
In summary, we found that tVNS can significantly reduce the severity of depression in 
patients. After tVNS, DMN FC showed significant changes in brain regions involved in 
emotional modulation. Some FC changes are also associated with depression severity 
changes in MDD patients. Our findings provide a framework of the brain network to further 
understand the mechanism of tVNS treatment in MDD patients.
