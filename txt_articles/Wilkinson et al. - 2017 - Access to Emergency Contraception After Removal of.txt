abstract
BACKGROUND: Levonorgestrel emergency contraception (EC) is safe and effective for postcoital 
pregnancy prevention. Starting in 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration removed age 
restrictions, enabling EC to be sold over the counter to all consumers. We sought to compare 
the availability and access for female adolescents with the 2012 study, using the same study 
design.
METHODS: Female mystery callers posing as 17-year-old adolescents in need of EC used 
standardized scripts to telephone 979 pharmacies in 5 US cities. Using 2015 estimated 
census data and the federal poverty level, we characterized income levels of pharmacy 
neighborhoods.
RESULTS: Of 979 pharmacies, 827 (83%) indicated that EC was available. This proportion 
did not vary by pharmacy neighborhood income level, nor was significantly different from 
the 2012 study (P = .78). When examining access, 8.3% of the pharmacies reported it was 
impossible to obtain EC under any circumstances, which occurred more often in low-
income neighborhoods (10.3% vs 6.3%, adjusted odds ratio 1.5; 95% confidence interval 
1.20–1.94). This was not significantly different from 2012 (P = .66). Correct information 
regarding over-the-counter access was conveyed only 51.6% of the time; accuracy did not 
differ by pharmacy's neighborhood income (47.9% vs 55.3%, adjusted odds ratio 0.89; 95% 
confidence interval 0.71–1.11) and was not significantly different from 2012 (P = .37).
CONCLUSIONS: A majority of pharmacies have EC available; however, barriers to and disparities 
in access for adolescents persist and have not changed since the previous study despite 
regulatory changes that were designed to improve access to EC.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Same-day access 
to emergency contraception (EC) is an important 
piece of effective pregnancy prevention for 
adolescents. Starting in 2013, the US Food and Drug 
Administration made EC available over the counter 
for consumers of all ages.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Despite policy changes 
that started in 2013 that were intended to improve 
access to EC, there are still persistent barriers 
to access that are more prominent in low-income 
neighborhoods and have been unchanged since a 
2012 study.

Great strides have been made in 
reducing teenage pregnancy in the 
United States since the 1990s. 
1 
However, the United States still 
has the highest rate of unintended 
teenage pregnancies among similar 
high-income countries, which 
costs ∼$9.4 billion annually. 
1, 
 
2 
Disparities by race and/or ethnicity 
and socioeconomic factors persist 
and are important to address 
given the long-term health and 
social consequences of unplanned 
pregnancies. 
1, 
3 Levonorgestrel 
emergency contraception (EC) is a 
safe and effective form of pregnancy 
prevention when used after 
unprotected sex or contraceptive 
failure. 
4 Access to EC is a core 
component of comprehensive 
pregnancy prevention in adolescents.
In a 2012 study, we showed that 
although EC was available at 
pharmacies, barriers to access 
for adolescents in low-income 
neighborhoods still existed. 
5 Such 
barriers are problematic because 
any delay in taking EC will impact its 
effectiveness. 
6, 
 
7 After a federal court 
case in 2013, the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) removed all 
age restrictions and identification 
requirements so that brand-name 
EC (Plan B One-Step) could be 
sold over the counter (OTC) and 
without a prescription to anyone. 
8 
Furthermore, in 2014, restrictions on 
generic forms of EC were removed; 
however, packaging still had to 
include a “use recommendation” 
that mentioned the intended users 
were women ≥17 years old until 
2016. This decision was intended 
to improve access for consumers of 
all ages and enable EC to be taken 
sooner and more consistently when 
needed. However, no studies have 
determined whether this regulatory 
change has improved availability and 
access for adolescents.
We sought to examine if the FDA 
policy change resulted in increased 
availability of or access to EC for 
adolescents by using the same 
study design and population as the 
Wilkinson et al 
5 2012 study. We 
employed “mystery callers” posing 
as adolescents to conduct scripted 
telephone calls to pharmacies in 5 
major US cities and determine the 
availability and accessibility of EC. 
We hypothesized that availability 
and access had improved since these 
policy changes but that barriers and 
disparities would still exist.
METHODS
Two female research assistants 
posing as 17-year-old adolescents 
called every retail pharmacy in 
Nashville, Tennessee; Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Ohio; 
Austin, Texas; and Portland, Oregon 
between July and December 2015. 
Lists of licensed pharmacies within 
the counties were obtained from local 
Boards of Pharmacy, and nonretail 
pharmacies (eg, home health care 
and hospitals) were removed. The 
age of 17 was chosen to replicate 
the previous study methods, and 
calls were made during weekdays 
between 9 AM and 5 PM local time of 
each city called. 
5
Callers followed standardized scripts 
( 
Fig 1) to elicit specific, uniform 
information on EC availability and 
access. The first question of the script 
examined same-day availability 
with the question (Step 1), “Hi, I’m 
calling to see if I can get emergency 
contraception today?” If EC was 
available, the next question examined 
whether a 17-year-old could access 
it with the question (Step 2), “If I am 
17, is that okay?” If the pharmacy 
staff member said that she could not 
obtain EC because of her age, we 
considered this a denial of access 
and the call was ended. If the call 
continued and it had not already 
been discussed naturally, the final 
question was asked (Step 3), “My 
friends said there is an age rule, do 
you know what it is?” We deemed 
calls that reported no age restrictions 
on EC as being correct information; 
otherwise, they were coded as 
incorrect. Data were collected during 
calls in standardized abstraction 
forms.
To examine the outcomes on the 
basis of neighborhood income, 
pharmacy addresses were merged 
with 2015 census block group 
estimates of median household 
income provided by GeoLytics, Inc 
(Somerville, NJ).

questions were asked.

of the 2015 federal poverty level for a 
household size of 3 were considered 
low-income neighborhoods.
We used logistic regression to 
examine how outcomes differed 
across low-income versus higher-
income neighborhoods by clustering 
by city and adjusting for the study 
year and whether a pharmacy 
was part of a chain. To compare 
adjusted odds ratios (aORs) between 
the studies, we calculated the 
interaction between study year 
and neighborhood income for each 
outcome variable.
We examined the same 3 outcomes 
as the 2012 Wilkinson et al 
5 study 
as follows: (1) same-day availability, 
(2) whether the caller could access 
EC, and (3) whether the correct age 
for OTC access (ie, any age) was 
communicated by the pharmacy staff.
Data were analyzed using SAS, 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc; Cary, 
NC). The Children’s Hospital Los 
Angeles Institutional Review Board 
deemed this study to be nonhuman 
subjects research.
RESULTS
We eliminated 145 pharmacies from 
our initial sample of 1138 because 
they were noncommercial, which left 
a final sample of 993 pharmacies. As 
with the previous study, Philadelphia 
contributed the most (406, 40.9%) to 
our sample, and Portland contributed 
the fewest (96, 9.7%) ( 
Table 1). A 
majority (71.4%) of pharmacies were 
chain pharmacies (≥4 locations), 
but only 5.2% were open 24 hours 
per day. Almost all (98.6%) of the 
pharmacies could be geocoded, which 
left a sample of 979 (42.7%) of them 
located in low-income neighborhoods.
When examining same-day 
availability, we found a similar rate 
when compared with the 2012 study 
(83.3% vs 80.5%), with no significant 
differences on the basis of the 
neighborhood income of a pharmacy 
in either study ( 
Table 2) or between 
the aORs (P = .78). However, 8.3% of 
the pharmacies in this study denied 
access to EC and told the caller that 
there was no possible way to obtain 
EC because of their stated age of 17. 
This denial of access happened more 
often in pharmacies located in low-
income neighborhoods (aOR 1.53, 
95% confidence interval 1.20–1.94) 
( 
Table 2) and with no significant 
differences over time (P = .66).
Finally, when callers assessed the 
pharmacy staff’s understanding of 
dispensing regulations, they found 
48.4% of pharmacies incorrectly 
reported that EC was not available 
without a prescription to consumers 
of any age. In these instances, 
pharmacy staff mentioned some 
type of restriction based on age or 
a prescription requirement to the 
caller. This misinformation did not 
vary by neighborhood income level of 
a pharmacy like in the previous study 
(0.89, aOR 0.71–1.11) ( 
Table 2) and 
had not changed significantly over 
time (P = .37).
DISCUSSION
Same-day availability of EC in 
selected metropolitan cities in 
the United States (as reported 
by pharmacists) has remained 
unchanged for adolescent callers 
since the last study in 2012 despite 
policy changes in 2013 and 2014. 
In the 2 years since the FDA 
removed age restrictions for brand-
name EC access, adjusted analysis 
shows no significant changes 
regarding access or misinformation. 
Furthermore, denial of access to 
nonprescription EC to minors 
continues to be communicated 
more often by pharmacies located 
in low-income neighborhoods, and 
that has not changed since 2012. 
In these instances, pharmacy staff 
told the callers that there was no 
possible way to obtain EC (with or 
without a prescription) because of 
their reported age of 17, which is 
concerning because an adolescent 
may not attempt to get EC after being 
told this. Other research has been 
published on EC availability since 
the 2012 study.

our knowledge, this is the first study 
to replicate the study design and 
examine whether the policy changes 
that began in 2013 may have resulted 
in changes to barriers to availability 
or access over time.
There are several limitations of our 
study that warrant consideration. 
First, although the sampling frame 
for the 2 studies was identical, the 
individual pharmacies were not 
exactly the same. Therefore, we could 
not make comparisons between the 
studies on an individual-pharmacy 
level and so only compared the 
outcomes on an aggregate level. 
Second, as in the previous study, 
we did not ask for the identities of 
the pharmacy staff members and 
thus cannot comment on the direct 
source of the misinformation. Third, 
information provided over the phone 
does not necessarily reflect what 
would happen during in-person 
inquiries. Now that EC is available 
OTC, pharmacies often stock EC on 
the store shelf, and thus, consumers 
can obtain EC without interacting 
with a pharmacy staff member. 
Furthermore, during our data 
collection, labeling for generic EC 
continued to incorporate age-related 
user recommendations, which could 
propagate confusion for pharmacy 
staff members and possibly be 
interpreted as a restriction.
Despite these limitations, we 
believe that our study demonstrates 
persistent barriers in access to EC 
since the 2013 policy change that 
removed age restrictions. The FDA 
made this regulatory decision to 
expand access of EC to all consumers, 
but especially to adolescents in need 
of unplanned-pregnancy prevention. 
Unfortunately, that change was 
necessary but not sufficient. 
Misinformation about and denial of 
access to EC for adolescents endures 
and is more common in low-income 
neighborhoods. Additional education 
and information for pharmacy 
staff and adolescents regarding 
availability and access could help 
eliminate these barriers, especially 
in low-income neighborhoods. This 
education could come in the form 
of uniform package labels for all 
levonorgestrel EC that clearly states 
the regulations regardless of the 
brand being obtained as well as 
education tailored to pharmacy staff 
members. Clinicians, particularly 
those who treat adolescents, can 
continue to provide education for 
their patients regarding availability 
and access when discussing 
pregnancy prevention.
