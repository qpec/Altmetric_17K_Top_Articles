IMPORTANCE Alemtuzumab, a CD52-depleting monoclonal antibody, effectively inhibits
relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) but is associated with a high incidence of secondary B-cell
autoimmunities that limit use. These effects may be avoided through control of B-cell
hyperproliferation.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the data describing the effect of alemtuzumab on
lymphocyte subsets collected during the phase 3 trial program reveal mechanisms explaining
efficacy and the risk for secondary autoimmunity with treatment of MS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Lymphocyte reconstitution data from regulatory
submissions of the pivotal Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif Efficacy in Multiple
Sclerosis I and II (CARE-MS I and II) trials were obtained from the European Medicines Agency
via Freedom of Information requests. Data used in this study were reported from June 22 to
October 12, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Tabulated data from T- and B-lymphocyte subset analysis
and antidrug antibody responses were extracted from the supplied documents.
RESULTS Alemtuzumab depleted CD4+ T cells by more than 95%, including regulatory cells
(−80%) and CD8+ T cells (>80% depletion), which remained well below reference levels
throughout the trials. However, although CD19+ B cells were initially also depleted (>85%),
marked (180% increase) hyperrepopulation of immature B cells occurred with conversion to
mature B cells over time. These lymphocyte kinetics were associated with rapid development
of alemtuzumab-binding and -neutralizing antibodies and subsequent occurrence of
secondary B-cell autoimmunity. Hyperrepopulation of B cells masked a marked, long-term
depletion of CD19+ memory B cells that may underpin efficacy in MS.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although blockade of memory T and B cells may limit MS,
rapid CD19+ B-cell subset repopulation in the absence of effective T-cell regulation has
implications for the safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab. Controlling B-cell proliferation until
T-cell regulation recovers may limit secondary autoimmunity, which does not occur with
other B-cell–depleting agents.

ultiple sclerosis (MS) is a major, immune-mediated,
demyelinating,neurodegenerativediseaseofthecen-
tral nervous system and is the leading cause of non-
traumatic disability in young adults. The phase 2 trial1 and piv-
otal licensing trials2,3 for alemtuzumab demonstrated that this
CD52-depletingmonoclonalantibody(mAb)isamongthemost
potent disease-modifying treatments in relapsing MS.1-4 This
drug can induce long-term remission after only a short course
of treatment.4 However, use of alemtuzumab is limited be-
cause it induces a number of secondary B-cell autoimmunities
in people with MS.1-4 Although these effects may occur rapidly
after alemtuzumab infusion,5 the incidence typically peaks 2
to 3 years after treatment initiation and occurs in about 50% of
people with MS within 5 to 7 years of treatment.4,6
Although efficacy in people with MS has been attributed
to CD4 T-cell deletion and relative sparing of CD4 T regula-
tory cells,7-10 less attention has been paid to the reason for the
generation of secondary autoimmunities occurring after
alemtuzumab administration. Autoimmunity may be attrib-
utable to the relative lack of thymic repopulation that occurs
after alemtuzumab treatment.11 However, preferential ex-
pansion of memory cells typically occurs after antibody-
mediated T-cell depletion and is not associated with the de-
velopment of B-cell autoimmunities.12,13
We hypothesized that B-cell dynamics are central to sec-
ondaryautoimmunitiesandthatrepopulationkinetics14,15may
offer some clues on this aspect. However, the lymphocyte sub-
setrepopulationcapacitiesobservedinthepivotalphase3trials
were only partially described2,3 and have remained unpub-
lished, although based on meeting abstracts, data document-
ingB-cellissueswerecollectedandanalyzedmanyyearsago.6-18
These data, coupled with recent animal studies using CD52-
specificantibodiesthatindicatedlowerefficacyofB-celldeple-
tion activity in lymphoid tissues19,20 and blockade of immune
tolerance induction by CD52-depleting antibody,20 may shed
light on potential adverse effect profiles of alemtuzumab.
Methods
After Freedom of Information requests to the European Medi-
cines Agency in London, England, we received redacted cop-
ies of the regulatory submissions of the pivotal phase 3 trials
Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif Efficacy in Multiple
Sclerosis I (CARE-MS I), which focused on drug-naive pwMS,2
and CARE-MS II, which focused on people with MS who had
used beta interferons or glatiramer acetate.3 Primary data re-
lating to leukocyte numbers were not part of the submission
or were not received. The data presented herein only concern
the 12-mg/d alemtuzumab dose used in clinical practice that
was derived from the tabulated documents supplied. In some
instances, the percentages reported (Figure 1 and Figure 2) are
derived from analysis of the mean data values relating to ab-
solute numbers and may thus have subtle differences from the
actual individual percentage data if they had been available.
Data used in this study were reported from June 22 to Octo-
ber 12, 2016. Although these trials were recruited following
ethical approval of the trials and informed consent, as previ-
ously reported,2,3 no specific ethical approval was obtained or
required to view and use these documents in the public do-
main. The details of participants were anonymous.
Results
The pivotal phase 3 trials2,3 stated that B cells “recovered2/
repopulated3 within 6 months” whereas “T cells recovered2/
reconstitutedmore2slowly,2(p1825)3(p1835)approachingthelower
limit of normal at 1 year after treatment.
” The regulatory sub-
missionobtainedfromtheEuropeanMedicinesAgencyshowed
that similar results were obtained after analysis of lympho-
cyte phenotyping data from the CARE-MS I and II studies
(Table 1). These results found marked T-cell (Table 1 and
Figure 1) and B-cell (Table 1 and Figure 2) depletion within 1
month after antibody administration and a less marked effect
on natural killer cells (CD16+ and CD56+), followed by variable
degrees of reconstitution of all lymphocyte subsets (Table 1).
Long-term Depletion of CD4 and CD8 T Regulatory Cells
A rapid (with 1 month) and marked (95.3% in CARE-MS I and
II) depletion of peripheral blood CD4 T cells (Figure 1A) and
depletion of CD8 cells of 85.4% in CARE-MS I and 83.7% in
CARE-MS II (Figure 2B) were evident. Their numbers re-
mained low and constituted a CD4 T-cell depletion of approxi-
mately 69.0% in CARE-MS I and 69.8% in CARE-MS II and a
CD8 T-cell depletion of 47.2% in CARE-MS I and 46.4% in
CARE-MS II 1 year after alemtuzumab treatment. This deple-
tion was well below the lower reference limit (400/μL [to con-
vert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001])21 for the CD4+ T-cell popu-
lation,andanaverageofabout35monthshasbeenreportedfor
CD4+ T-cell repopulation to reach the lower reference limit.8,21
Although CD4 memory cells may repopulate relatively
faster than naive CD4 T cells after depletion,11,14 naive CD4
(CD45RA+)(Figure1C)andmemoryCD4(CD45RA-)Tcellswere
substantially depleted. The depletion of CD4 T cells may ac-
count for the marked effect of alemtuzumab on inhibiting re-
lapsing MS,7 as occurs in many animal models of MS.20
Incontrast,CD8Tcellsmaycontainpathogeniccells,based
ontheobservationthatCD8TcellspredominateinMSlesions.22
Key Points
Question Are lymphocyte subset reconstitution kinetics
associated with efficacy and adverse effects of alemtuzumab
administration in multiple sclerosis?
Findings Analysis of previously unpublished data from pivotal
phase 3 trials in the regulatory submissions of alemtuzumab
indicated that efficacy was associated with long-term depletion of
memory T and B cells, whereas rapid hyperrepopulation of
immature B cells in the relative absence of regulatory CD4 and
CD8 T cells create the environment for the generation of
secondary B-cell autoimmunity, including anti–drug antibodies.
Meaning Controlling this B-cell hyperrepopulation after
alemtuzumab administration may limit the risk for secondary
autoimmunity if administration can be performed safely.

 The depletion of immune cells by alemtuzumab was associ-
ated with a high level of infections (253 of 376 [67.3%] in
CARE-MS I and 334 of 435 [76.8%] in CARE-MS II)2,3 and nota-
bly viral infections, including 130 of 811 of people with MS with
herpes simplex virus infections (16%),2,3 which may be attrib-
uted at least in part to cytotoxic T-cell depletion. However, loss
of CD8 T-cell activity has been associated with loss of im-
mune tolerance induction in an experimental autoimmune
model of MS.20 Therefore, the losses of CD4 T regulatory cells
(CD4+,CD25intermediate/bright,andCD127-/low)(Figure1E)andCD8
T regulatory cells (CD8+, CD25intermediate/bright, and CD127-/low)
(Figure 1F) were of interest. This finding is perhaps surprising
becausethereportedproportionofTregulatorycellsintheCD4,
CD25+, and CD127low population, which in other studies ex-
pressesFoxP3andotherregulatorycell-associatedmarkersand
exhibits T regulatory cell function,9,10 increased from 3.4% to
13.7% in CARE-MS I and from 3.8% to 12.5% in CARE-MS II,16,17
supporting the view that T regulatory cell function is en-
hanced after alemtuzumab administration.
However, the reality is that the absolute number of CD4 T
regulatory cells remains dramatically reduced by 81% in
CARE-MS I and 86.3% in CARE-MS II10,14 (Figure 1E), com-
pared with baseline, consistent with less than 100 T regula-
tory cells/50 mL of blood reported previously.14 This loss may
be marginal in the context of T-cell control of autoimmunity,
because regulatory CD8 cells will repopulate faster than the
pathogenic cells driving MS and thus will return in the pres-
ence of adequate levels of regulation to limit the reemergence
of MS. However, significant loss of T regulatory cells occurs
compared with B lymphocytes at a time when B cells are re-

 populating and hyperrepopulating (Figure 2). This feature may
be crucial in the development of secondary autoimmunities.
Creation of a Substrate for B-Cell Autoimmunities
by Rapid B-Cell Hyperrepopulation
Although CD19+ B cells reached reference levels within 6
months as reported,1-3 the substantial hyperpopulation of
CD19+ B cells that occurred was ignored (Table 1). This find-
ing is of interest because the secondary autoimmunities oc-
curring after alemtuzumab treatment in people with MS, such
as Goodpasture syndrome, Graves disease, hemolytic ane-
mia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, are antibody-
mediated B-cell autoimmunities.4 Thus, although B-cell hy-
perresponsivenesshasbeenreported,15thisaspecthasbecome
largely ignored and was surprisingly not reported in the phase
2 and 3 trial publications or supplementary data.1-3 CD20-
specific antibodies and cladribine deplete B cells, inhibit re-
lapsingMS,anddonotinduceCD19B-cellhyperpopulation23,24
or secondary autoimmunity.25,26 However, autoimmunity
sometimes occurs after hematopoietic stem cell therapy with-
outalemtuzumab.27Thisoccurrencesuggeststhatmarkedlym-
phocyte depletion in people with MS and B-cell recovery in the
absence of T-cell regulation may be a key issue in the devel-
opment of alemtuzumab-induced autoimmunity. The higher
frequency of autoimmunities compared with hematopoietic
stem cell therapy4,6,27 may relate to coordination of the T- and
B-cell reconstitution kinetics.
The most informative aspect to understand the CD19 hy-
perpopulation (Figure 2A), which expanded to 35.3% above
baseline in CARE-MS I and 26.8% above baseline in CARE-MS
II (Table 1), was the B-cell subset analysis (Figure 2B-D). This
analysis demonstrated that the CD19 B-cell hyperprolifera-
tion (Figure 2A) was a product of initial and substantial imma-
ture (CD19+, CD27-, IgD+, CD38+, and CD10+) B-cell repopula-
tion (Figure 2B) of the blood (approximately 180% at baseline),
ashasbeennotedpreviously.15Thisrepopulationledtothesub-
sequent maturation to naive (CD19+, CD27-, IgD+, CD38+, and
CD10-) B cells, which were initially markedly depleted by
alemtuzumab but repopulated to approximately 130% above
baseline (Figure 2C). This effect was countered by the marked
andlong-lastingdepletionofmemory(CD19+andCD27+)Bcells
(Figure 2D). Thus, marked changes in the B-cell compartment
could affect the development of autoimmunities.
Loss of Tolerance After Alemtuzumab Administration
Although approximately 20% of people with MS have been re-
ported to develop secondary autoimmunities during the
alemtuzumab trials, including 68 of 376 (18.1%) in CARE-MS I
and 69 of 435 (15.8%) in CARE-MS II,2,3 this proportion in-
creased to 317 of 811 people with MS (39.1%) in the 5-year fol-
low-up of the CARE-MS studies.6 This finding suggests that al-
emtuzumab was blocking immune tolerance induction, which
was consistent with results of mouse studies using CD52-
depleting antibodies.20 This finding was perhaps further in-
dicated by the development of alemtuzumab-specific anti-
bodies. Humanization is designed to reduce drug-specific
antibody responses; compared with approximately 13% of
people with MS developing a neutralizing response to chime-
ric CD20-specific mAb,28 humanized CD20-specific antibod-
ies induce antiglobulin responses in less than 1% of cases.29
However, as reported herein, alemtuzumab-neutralizing an-
tibody responses developed in approximately 81.2% of people
with MS in CARE-MS I and 76.3% of people with MS in
CARE-MS II.
No mention has been made of neutralizing antibodies in
the pivotal trials,2,3 and the occurrence of binding antibodies
received cursory attention to indicate that they occur in ap-
proximately 30% of people with MS before and 80% after the
second cycle (Table 2). These findings ignored the fact that,
despiteitspotentialtodepletelymphocytes,alemtuzumabcan
induce T-cell immunity,30 and during the trials, 327 of 376
peoplewithMS(87%)inCARE-MSIand364of435peoplewith
MS (83.7%) in CARE-MS II developed binding antibodies spe-
cific for alemtuzumab.5,31 Furthermore, of those people with
MS who developed binding antibodies, 93.3% of CARE-MS I
and 91.2% of CARE-MS II people with MS had neutralizing

 antibodies at some stage. A large proportion of people with MS
developed an alemtuzumab-specific response within the first
month after infusion (Table 2). This response was boosted by
the second cycle of alemtuzumab treatment (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement).
Although binding2,3 and, in abstract form, neutralizing5
antibodies are reported not to influence clinical, depletion,
and repopulation efficacy and infusion reactions, it is incon-
ceivable that the generation of binding and neutralizing anti-
bodies remains ultimately without effect (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement). Because infusion-related reactions occur in
approximately 90% of people with MS as a consequence of
lymphocyte depletion,2,3 the problem of antiglobulin
responses may be masked by the corticosteroids, antihista-
mines, and acetaminophen (paracetamol) used to control
infusion-related reactions,32 which can be serious in a small
(approximately 3%) proportion of individuals.2,3 However,
some people with MS fail to respond adequately to alemtu-
zumab, even after multiple treatment cycles.4 In such cases,
one should establish whether alemtuzumab neutralization is
the cause, and treatment can be switched as persistent neu-
tralizing antibodies become problematic.32
Although a potential lack of immune tolerance induction
may contribute to the generation of alemtuzumab-specific an-
tibodies, this may reflect simple immunogenicity of the
molecule.30 Alemtuzumab may deplete via antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity with a lesser effect through
complement depletion.19 As such, B-cell depletion is notably
limited in the lymphoid tissues, including bone marrow, com-
pared with the peripheral blood in animals18 and possibly
humans.5,33 This limitation may allow new autoimmune B-cell
responses to be generated.5 In addition, rapid reactivation of
the disease may be allowed,5,33 if pathogenic cells are seques-
tered in the bone marrow or lymph glands by previous treat-
ments, such as fingolimod, and not sufficiently depleted ow-
ing to the relatively short serum half-life of alemtuzumab.33
This aspect may also allow drug-specific antibody responses
to be generated, and these may develop within the few days
required for the first cycle of alemtuzumab to be complete.
Once generated, humoral immunologic memory can survive
the immune-depleting effects because people with MS treated
with alemtuzumab retain their ability to mount an antibody
response against common viruses and recall antigens.34 In the
future, reduction of immunogenicity may be feasible with fur-
ther development of CD52-specific reagents.30
Discussion
A New Mechanism for the Generation
of Alemtuzumab-Induced Autoimmunity
The immune system clearly controls relapsing MS, as shown
by marked induction of no evident disease activity after he-
matopoietic stem cell therapy.27 However, although lympho-
penia is a common feature of many immunotherapies, it is not
necessarily associated with the development of secondary au-
toimmunity. Furthermore, the T- and B-cell depletions and re-
constitutionsbymemoryTcellsandimmatureB-cellpoolsthat
occur after alemtuzumab treatment also occurred after CD4
T-cell13 and CD20 B-cell depletion24,35 treatments that did not
cause secondary autoimmunities. We hypothesize the B-cell
depletion and rapid repopulation in the absence of effective
T-cell regulation in an individual with genetic susceptibility
for autoimmunity are key factors in the development of au-
toimmunity. As such, alemtuzumab induces secondary auto-
immunities in people with MS, who may be predisposed to de-
velop other autoimmunities, including thyroid disease,36
whereas secondary autoimmunities are not a feature among
patients receiving alemtuzumab for the treatment of cancer.37
During lymphopenia, some mechanisms that normally
serve to maintain host tolerance are temporarily suspended.38
PeripheralTcellsproliferateinresponsetoself-antigensinlym-
phopenic hosts, but proliferation toward these same anti-
gens is prevented when T-cell numbers are within reference
limits. This process, termed homeostatic peripheral expan-
sion, augments peripheral T-cell number and limits reper-
toire skewing during recovery from lymphopenia and predis-
poses lymphopenic hosts to autoimmune disease.38 An
associationofsecondaryautoimmunityafteralemtuzumabhas
been suggested with lymphopenia and reduced thymic out-
put, leading to homeostatic T-cell proliferation and chroni-
cally activated oligoclonal memory T cells.15 This finding has
prompted the Keratinocyte Growth Factor to Prevent Autoim-
munity After Alemtuzumab Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis
(CAM-THY) trial.39 The development of secondary autoimmu-
nity has also been suggested to be associated with the level of
T-cell regulation and interleukin 21 (IL-21) production.38,40
Investigators40 have thought that driving cycles of T-cell ex-
pansion and apoptosis would increase the stochastic oppor-
tunities for T cells to encounter self-antigen.

 However, we propose alternative B-cell–centric mecha-
nisms to explain alemtuzumab-induced autoimmunity. Inter-
leukin 21 influences B-cell function, notably regulatory B-cell
function, and IL-21 signaling in B cells has been shown to be
important in the development of antibody-induced
autoimmunity.41 Furthermore, the lymphocyte repopulation
data presented herein suggest that after alemtuzumab admin-
istration, a surge of immature B cells repopulates the blood,
probably from the bone marrow,15 in the absence of effective
T-cellregulationviaCD4TregulatorycellsandCD8regulatory/
suppressor cells,20 which could allow escape of autoreactive
B cells41 (Figure 3). Although suggested to be a potential rea-
sonforthegenerationofautoimmunity,37CD4Tregulatorycell
depletion has been dismissed as an issue,14,40 notably when
T regulatory cells form a greater population of the regenerat-
ing CD4 T-cell pool.9,10,14 However, the absolute numbers of
CD8 T cells and CD4 T regulatory cells are substantially re-
duced relative to B-cell numbers, at a time when rapid B-cell
expansion is occurring and T-cell regulation may be limited,
particularly if T regulatory cell function requires cell-cell con-
tact for functional activity to occur. Because T regulatory cells
can control the silencing of autoreactive immature B cells ex-
iting the bone marrow as they mature into naive B cells,42,43
the conditions are clearly established to allow the escape of
B-cell autoimmunity.38,41 Indeed, deficits related to dimin-
ished CD4 T regulatory cell function and increased immature
B cells have been related to childhood and adult thyrombocy-
topenic purpuras, which is one of the adverse autoimmuni-
ties after alemtuzumab treatment.44,45
However, because the autoantibody production is likely
to be CD4 T-cell dependent, autoimmunity will require T-cell
help, and thus autoimmunity is unlikely to occur until CD4
T-cell numbers regenerate (Figure 3). This situation creates a
delay between the time of B-cell hyperreactivity and the de-
velopment of autoimmunity. This finding is consistent with
the observation that autoimmunity peaks in the years 2 to 3
as CD4 T cells repopulate, with approximately 20% of people
with MS developing thyroiditis compared with approxi-
mately 10% in years 2, 4, and 5 in the CARE-MS follow-up
studies.6 Furthermore, if the generation of autoreactive B cells
is the primary driver of autoimmunity, driving more diverse
T cells to exit the thymus and potentially support autoreac-
tive B cells, as examined in the CAM-THY trial,39 may be coun-
terproductive, and we therefore await the results of the trial
with great interest. Furthermore, in addition to silencing of the
generation of autoreactive immature B cells, T-cell function
controls germinal center activity and the generation of auto-
antibodies during antibody affinity maturation.46 Using this
mechanism, primary antibodies directed against gut bacteria
can increase their binding affinity for the bacterial target as the
antibody response develops, to gain cross-reactivity with and
stimulation of the thyroid hormone receptor that occurs in
Graves disease.47 Therefore, the thyroid-related autoimmu-
nity that is the major immunologic consequence of alemtu-
zumab treatment developing in 317 of 811 people with MS
(39.1%) in the 5-year follow-up of the CARE-MS studies5 is of
interestandconsistentwiththefindingsofotherstudieswhere
35 of 86 people (40.7%) developed thyroid issues.4 Further-
more, Graves hyperthyroidism was present in 22 of 35 people
with MS (62.9%) compared with 13 of 35 (34.3%) with
hypothyroidism.4 Therefore, molecular mimicry between mi-
crobiota and autoantigens48 and the discoordinated kinetics
of T- and B-cell reconstitution may contribute to the genera-
tion of autoimmunity.
Although animal studies in MS clearly indicate that re-
population of T cells relates to return of disease activity20 and
may occur in humans,6 this indication is clearly not abso-
lutely related to the total number of detectable cells. Like-
wise, the analysis of generalized (CD4, CD8, and CD19) popu-
lations appears to have failed to provide definitive evidence
of the precise mechanisms of relapse and autoimmunity.8 This
failure is likely to require detection and monitoring of lym-
phocyte subsets, such as CD19+ and CD27+ or, more impor-
tantly, antigen-specific responses. This monitoring may be fea-
sible because blood plasma samples must be taken and tested
for autoimmunity, notably idiopathic thrombocytopenic pur-
pura, for 4 years after the last infusion of alemtuzumab. There-
fore, through analysis of cells that are discarded for blood test-
ing, antigen-specific responses may be identified. This process
should be feasible because (1) relapses, presumably due to
responses to the autoantigen in MS, occur in approximately
50% to 60% of people within 2 years after treatment with
alemtuzumab4; (2) approximately 48% of people develop sec-
ondary B-cell autoimmunities4; and (3) more than 80% of
people produce drug-specific antibody responses. Additional
studies are evidently needed.
Based on the immunophenotyping data, CD4 T cells and
CD19+ and CD27+ B cells demonstrated long-term inhibition,
and these subsets may harbor the pathogenic cells that con-
trol MS. Although most experts in the field believe T cells drive
disease activity in people with MS, CD4 T-cell depletion is per-
ceived to have failed to control MS after CD4 mAb-induced
depletion.12However,the70%CD4depletiontargetedtomain-
tain cell numbers greater than 250/μL in CD4-specific mAb
trials12 was substantially less than the 95% CD4 T-cell deple-
tion achieved with alemtuzumab, which provided a clear sup-
pression of disease activity.2,3 Because some effects were seen
on magnetic resonance imaging lesion loads after treatment

 with CD4 mAb administration after depletion of approxi-
mately70%ofCD4Tcellswasachieved,12thismaybethemini-
mumdepletionrequiredfordiseaseinhibition.However,evalu-
ating the association of cell numbers with disease activity after
alemtuzumab treatment has not always proved to be
informative7,8 and this is likely to remain an issue. Until the
frequency of antigen-specific pathogenic cells relative to the
disease activity can be reliably monitored, gauging the lym-
phocyte level required to control disease will not be possible.
However, that persistent T-cell depletion sustained for over 2
years, as shown after alemtuzumab treatment, coupled with
tolerization of pathogenic cells by the repopulating regula-
tory systems that regenerate at a faster rate than pathogenic
cells, may underscore why repeated treatment is often not re-
quired and long-term remission is induced4 (Figure 3).
AlthoughTcellsareconsideredtodrivediseaseinMS,most
agents that inhibit relapsing MS target B cells. That levels of
CD19+ and CD27+ cells remain low after alemtuzumab treat-
ment suggests that this subset of B cells may be a key sub-
strate of the mechanism by which alemtuzumab controls the
disease. Similarly, CD19+ and CD27+ cells are targeted by CD20-
specific mAb,24,35 and this approach appears to offer compa-
rable benefit, at least on some outcomes.2,26 Although B-cell
depletion has been argued to block antigen-presenting capac-
ity to stimulate pathogenic T cells or make pathogenic anti-
bodies, an alternative view could be that these therapeutic an-
tibodies are actually deleting the B-cell reservoir of infectious
agents, such as Epstein Barr virus, and possibly endogenous
retroviruses that have consistently been implicated as etio-
logic factors in MS and other autoimmune diseases.49
Limitations
Events occurring within the central nervous system or lym-
phoidtissuesarenotcapturedbyanalysisofthebloodandmay
bekeytounderstandingthepathogenesis.Importantly,theun-
availability of the primary data makes it impossible to prop-
erly interrogate the results, notably to determine the signifi-
cance, if any, of cell subset levels and neutralizing antibodies
on safety and disease activity at the level of individuals.
Conclusions
We hypothesize that limiting B-cell reconstitution until T regu-
latory and suppressor cell function returns may limit B-cell
autoimmunities after alemtuzumab treatment of people
with MS. However, adding other B-cell–targeting therapy
after alemtuzumab treatment may increase the risk for seri-
ous infections and cancers, thereby leading to worse out-
comes compared with the development of B-cell autoimmune
diseases, which are often manageable and nonfatal. There-
fore, careful consideration is needed before such an approach
is undertaken and should be formally tested to ensure patient
safety.
