Background: It is well established that screening can prevent cervical cancer, but the magnitude of the impact of regular
screening on cervical cancer mortality is unknown.
Methods: Population-based case–control study using prospectively recorded cervical screening data, England 1988–2013.
Case women had cervical cancer diagnosed during April 2007–March 2013 aged 25–79 years (N ¼ 11 619). Two cancer-free
controls were individually age matched to each case. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio
(OR) of developing stage-specific cancer for women regularly screened or irregularly screened compared with women not
screened in the preceding 15 years. Mortality was estimated from excess deaths within 5 years of diagnosis using stage-
specific 5-year relative survival from England with adjustment for age within stage based on SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology
and End Results, USA) data.
Results: In women aged 35–64 years, regular screening is associated with a 67% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62–73%) reduction
in stage 1A cancer and a 95% (95% CI: 94–97%) reduction in stage 3 or worse cervical cancer: the estimated
OR comparing regular (p5.5yearly) screening to no (or minimal) screening are 0.18 (95% CI: 0.16–0.19) for cancer incidence
and 0.08 (95% CI: 0.07–0.09) for mortality. It is estimated that in England screening currently prevents 70% (95% CI: 66–73%)
of cervical cancer deaths (all ages); however, if everyone attended screening regularly, 83% (95% CI: 82–84%) could be prevented.
Conclusions: The association between cervical cancer screening and incidence is stronger in more advanced stage cancers, and
screening is more effective at preventing death from cancer than preventing cancer itself.
Service evaluation of cancer screening is essential to monitor
effectiveness, to identify areas of good practice and areas where
improvements can be made (Sasieni and Cuzick, 2001). The
evaluation of programme effectiveness is usually undertaken by
linking data on incidence and mortality from cancer registries to
individual-level information regarding screening uptake and results
(NHS Cervical Screening Programme, 2006).
The National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme in
England was established in 1988. In the early 1990s, a cervical
cancer audit was initiated to evaluate the effectiveness of this
programme in preventing cervical cancer. Whereas much has been
published on the impact of the programme on the incidence of
cervical cancer (Sasieni et al, 2003; Sasieni et al, 2009), the effect of
screening on cervical cancer mortality is not known; as mortality is
the most demanding end point, it requires large numbers of
patients with long follow-up to ensure adequate power (Cuzick
et al, 2007). For cancers with moderate or good survival, it is highly
desirable to have surrogate end points that can reliably predict
mortality reductions several years earlier.
Several authors have estimated the effect of cervical screening on
cervical cancer mortality using mortality trends (Dickinson et al,
1972; Laara et al, 1987; Sasieni and Adams, 1999). However, trends

 are prone to bias and can only reflect population-level mortality.
Further, they do not directly estimate the efficacy in screened
women. In this paper, we use the data from a case–control study of
cervical cancer incidence, containing individual-level screening
histories, to estimate the preventive effect of regular screening on
cervical cancer of each FIGO (Fe

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population. We use data from the Audit of Invasive Cervical
Cancers (NHS Cervical Screening Programme, 2006), a population-
based case–control study in England that has been estimated to
include B90% of all cervical cancers with better completeness under
age 65 years. Cases were all women who had cervical cancer (ICD-10
C53) diagnosed in England between April 2007 and March 2013 at
age 25–79 years, and were registered with an NHS general practitioner
(GP). All women, except for those with a prior hysterectomy,
registered with an NHS GP who did not have cervical cancer at the
time of the case’s diagnosis were eligible as a control. Using a
computer programme, two controls were individually matched on age
and area of residence to each case. Very occasionally, only one control
could be found. Data were collected on all selected controls, removing
the possibility of participation bias.
Prospectively recorded cervical screening data were abstracted
from routinely recorded cervical cytology records held on the
Cervical Screening Call/Recall System, and were therefore not
subject to recall bias. These records include all NHS (and many
private provider) smears taken in the United Kingdom since 1988.
Local NHS staff linked the screening data to the cases and controls,
and the data were pseudonymised locally before being transferred
for cleaning and analysis. Guidelines on the collection of data for
this audit and details of the design have been published previously
(Sasieni et al, 2003; NHS Cervical Screening Programme, 2006;
Sasieni et al, 2009). Routine screening in England is offered 3
yearly to women aged 25–49 years and 5 yearly at ages 50–64 years.
We excluded women diagnosed under age 25.5 years for most
analyses because there is a peak in prevalent cancer diagnosis at age
25 (24.75–25.5) years when women are first screened (Castanon
et al, 2013). These prevalent cancers are primarily early stage (76%
stage 1A) and very few are fatal. Inclusion of these cancers skews
estimation of the effect of screening on cancer incidence.
Statistical analyses. We assumed that all stage 1A cancers in the
audit data set would have the stage recorded. Therefore, cases with
unknown stage were assumed not to be stage 1A, but otherwise to
be missing at random (conditional on age). Cases with missing
stage were therefore proportionally allocated to stages 1B, 2, or
3 þ , with the proportion in each of these stages determined by the
prevalence of the stage in each age group.
As age- and stage-specific mortality data are not available for
England, we used stage-specific 5-year relative survival from the
former Anglia Cancer Network, 2002–2006 (Cancer Research UK,
2014), and modified it using stage- and age-specific statistics from
SEER (Kosary, 2007) as follows: hazard ratios for different age
groups conditional on stage were calculated from SEER. These
were then applied to the Anglia survival and normalised (with a
stage-specific hazard ratio) so that the marginal stage-specific
survival matched that reported by Anglia. The age- and stage-
specific survival was then renormalised (with an age group-specific
hazard ratio) to ensure that the marginal 5-year relative survival in
each age group matched those reported for England as a whole
(Office for National Statistics, 2013). The overall 5-year relative
survival for Anglia between 2006 and 2010 (across all stages) was
69.6% among women aged 15–99 years, compared with 67.4% for
England and Wales between 2010 and 2011, and 71.5% in SEER
between 1988 and 2001 (aged 20 þ years). To estimate the impact
of screening on the risk of cancer diagnosis at each stage, each
woman’s maximum screening interval was calculated. This was
defined as the longest period during the screening window (see
below) in which there were no adequate smears (i.e., test result not
reported as ‘inadequate’ that equates to ‘unsatisfactory’ in other
cytology systems). These were then used to classify women as:
regularly screened, irregularly screened, very irregularly screened,
or not (or poorly) screened (Table 1). For women aged X65 years,
the screening window was ages 50–64 years. For women aged
35–64 years, the window was 15 years before case diagnosis. For
women aged 25–34 years, a slightly different definition of screening
regularity was used (Table 1). For controls, the date of diagnosis
was taken to be their matched case’s date of diagnosis. Conditional
logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios
(OR) for developing each stage of cancer by maximum screening
interval.
The numbers of cancers and excess deaths within 5 years of
diagnosis were estimated: (i) under current screening; (ii) in the
absence of screening; and (iii) assuming everyone was regularly
screened. For each FIGO stage, the numbers of cancers that would
occur

with 0 corresponding to the ‘not screened’ category) and ORij is the
OR of developing (stage-specific) cancer for women in age group i
in screening category j, compared with a baseline category of ‘never
screened’. There are three screening categories in addition to the
baseline category (i.e., ORi0); by definition ORi0 ¼ 1.
The excess number of deaths within 5 years of diagnosis of a

using equation (2).

As stage 1A cancers are unlikely to be diagnosed in the absence of
screening, all stage 1A cancers in never-screened women are
assumed in the main analysis to have stage 1B survival. This
assumption is relaxed in a sensitivity analysis.
We converted the effect of screening at different ages into
absolute numbers of cervical cancer deaths. We assume that the
age intervals of death are shifted by 5 years, for example, 25–34
years at diagnosis corresponds to 25–39 years at death, and 35–49
years corresponds to 40–54 years.
For the estimated deaths in the absence of/regular screening
within age groups, the relative risks (RRs) were multiplied by the
observed deaths. The RRs were estimated from the sum of the
estimated deaths in each age group when looking at all age groups
combined. The confidence intervals (CIs) for these RR were
obtained using the appropriately weighted sum of the variance of
the individual age groups. Deaths from cervical cancer at all ages
were included in this analysis to explore the effect of the screening
programme in the population as a whole rather than the effect of
screening in the target age group; however, we assume that
screening from age 25 to 64 years will not prevent deaths from
cancers diagnosed at age under 25 years or age over 79 years.

 For each age group and a particular level of screening, the RR
for incidence (mortality) was indirectly calculated by summing the
estimated number of cancers (excess deaths) diagnosed across all
stages, and dividing by the estimated number of cancers (deaths) in
the absence of screening. For comparison, the directly calculated
OR for incidence was calculated using a conditional logistic
regression model, including all cancers diagnosed in the relevant
age group, regardless of stage. As the indirect estimates are
weighted sums of the (age and) stage-specific ORs, CIs were
estimated using the delta method (for the variance of the log RR),
with an (appropriately) weighted sum of the estimated (age and)
stage-specific variances (Armitage et al, 2002).
We carried out a number of sensitivity analyses to test the effect of
(i) changing the screening window; (ii) assigning cancers with missing
stage using a number of criteria; (iii) applying stage 1A mortality to
the 1A cancers in the absence of screening scenario; (iv) including
women aged 24.5–25.5 years in the analysis. For the sensitivity
analyses, we present the OR comparing ‘never’-screened women to
the current level of screening in the population (i.e., control women)
for comparison with Table 4.
Analyses were carried out using Stata 13 (StataCorp, 2013).
RESULTS
A total of 11 619 cases of cervical cancer diagnosed aged 25.5–79
years were included in this study. For 2008–2012, the number of
cancers in women aged 25–79 years in the audit was 89.2% of those
reported in the Cancer Registry (Office for National Statistics,
2007–2012). FIGO stage was recorded for 10 040 cancers (86.4%).
Of those with a known stage, over a third were stage 1A (37.5%),
with a further 35.1% diagnosed at stage 1B. Overall, 39.0% of the
cancers were diagnosed at age 35–49 years, with 29.0% diagnosed
aged 25.5–34 years and 12.5% aged 65–79 years. The stage
distribution varied by age (Figure 1); 58.1% of women diagnosed
aged 25.5–34 years (with stage recorded) were diagnosed at FIGO
stage 1A and only 9.8% were diagnosed at stage 2 þ ; whereas two-
thirds (67.5%) of women diagnosed aged 65–79 years were
diagnosed at stage 2 þ .
Table 2 shows the ORs of a cervical cancer diagnosis by age,
stage, and maximum screening interval. At all ages, screening is
associated with a reduction in cancer diagnoses. Screening at age
50–64 years is associated with a reduced cervical cancer incidence
at ages 65–79 years. The negative association between screening
and cervical cancer is stronger for more advanced stages of cancer.
Although stage 1A cancer is generally screen detected (while still
asymptomatic), screening at all ages is associated with a lower odds
of being diagnosed (after age 25.5) with stage 1A cancer.
The estimated 5-year case fatalities (i.e., one minus 5-year
relative survival) in England by age and stage are shown in Table 3.
They depend heavily on stage at diagnosis and to a lesser extent on
age (for a given stage). Five-year case-fatality rates increase with
age within each stage, and are highest for women diagnosed aged
70–79 years.
We estimate that there would be 2.53 (95% CI: 2.39–2.68) times as
many cancers diagnosed aged 25–79 in the absence of screening, and
a third less (RR¼ 0.66, 95% CI: 0.64–0.67) if everyone was regularly
screened. The largest impact of changing screening practices on
cancer incidence rates is for women aged 50–64 years, where the
incidence rate would be over four times higher with no screening
(RR ¼ 4.15, 95% CI: 3.63–4.74), and less than half (RR ¼ 0.48, 95%
CI: 0.46–0.51) if everyone was regularly screened. Table 4 shows the
mortality rates (incidence multiplied by one minus the 5-year relative
survival) in the absence of screening and under regular screening
compared with current screening (assuming the observed associations
are causal). In the absence of screening, mortality would be four times
higher (RR¼ 4.13, 95% CI: 3.59–4.75) for women aged 35–49 years
and over five times higher (RR¼ 5.30, 95% CI: 4.36–6.44) for women
aged 50–64 years (Table 4). Conversely, if everyone was regularly
screened, mortality would be less than half what it currently is
(RR ¼ 0.42, 95% CI: 0.38–0.47) for women aged 35–49 years, and be
reduced by two-third (RR¼ 0.35, 95% CI: 0.33–0.37) for women aged
50–64 years at diagnosis.
Results from the sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Table)
suggest that including cancers in women aged 24.5–25.5 years
reduced the impact of screening in women under age 35 years by
21% for incidence (from 1.29 to 1.02) and by 16% for mortality
(from 2.20 to 1.84). The impacts of other changes were much less.
When we assume that stage 1A cancers could be ‘opportunistic’

 findings and would have the same fatality rates whether screen
detected or opportunistic, the mortality ORs were reduced by
between 0.8 and 18.2% depending on age, with the greatest effect
seen in young women where stage 1A cancer is most common.
Similar results were observed for the sensitivity analyses varying
the screening window (i.e., 15-, 12-, or 8-year windows and looking
only at the two preceding screening intervals) and the missing stage
allocation (no reallocation, all stage 2, all stage 3þ , and missing at
random from stages 1A, 1B, 2, and 3þ ). In all analyses, the ratio of
the mortality OR to the ones reported in Table 4 is between 0.66 and
1.08. The biggest difference (OR reduced from 5.3 to 3.5) was in
women aged 50–64 years when considering an 8-year screening
window. This suggests that screening continues to have some impact
on cervical cancer mortality at ages 50–64 years for 48 years.
The methodology used to estimate the association between
screening and mortality relies on the ability to estimate the stage-
specific associations and to combine these to obtain an overall
association. We test the robustness of this approach by comparing
the OR for cervical cancer (incidence) obtained directly without
reference to stage and the RRs obtained by combining stage-

 specific estimates. The two methods produced very similar results
for both point estimates and CIs (Table 5). The association
between screening and cancer was similar for women aged 35–64
years and 65–79 years, even though the screening interval
considered for women diagnosed aged 65–79 years was based on
their screening when aged 50–64 years. The association between
screening and 5-year cervical cancer mortality is stronger than
with cancer incidence for women aged 25.5–64 years. Among
women aged 35–64 years, the estimated ORs comparing regular
(p5.5 yearly) screening to no (or minimal) screening is 0.18,
95% CI: 0.16–0.19 using our approach (identical to 0.18, 95%
CI: 0.16–0.20 using the direct method) for cancer incidence and
0.08 (95% CI: 0.07–0.09) for mortality.
In England, there are an average of 796 deaths a year (2011–2014
average) from cervical cancer in women of all ages (Office for
National Statistics, 2015). It is estimated that screening currently
prevents 69.7% (95% CI: 66–73%) of cervical cancer deaths. However,
if everyone attended screening regularly 82.9% (95% CI: 82–84%) of
deaths could be prevented (i.e., half of deaths currently occurring
could be prevented). Applying the RRs in Table 4 to the observed
number of deaths in each age group, we estimate that there would be
an additional 1827 deaths per year from cervical cancer in the absence
of screening, and a further 347 deaths per year could be prevented if
everyone attended screening regularly between ages 25 and 64 years.
DISCUSSION
It is generally accepted that quality-assured cervical screening
reduces cervical cancer incidence. We have shown that regular
cervical screening in England is associated with lower cervical
cancer incidence, and that the strength of association increases
with age and advancing FIGO stage. Assuming associations are
causal, the mortality rate would be 5.3 times higher (95% CI:
4.4–6.4) in the absence of screening or 65% lower (95% CI:
63–67%) if everyone was regularly screened at ages 50–64 years. In
summary, if all women attended screening regularly, we estimate
that the crude mortality for women aged 25.5–79 years would be
half the current (95% CI: 0.48–0.52), whereas it would be 3.6 (95%
CI: 3.3–4.0) times higher in the absence of cervical screening. The
effect on mortality is greater than the effect on cancer incidence, as
cervical screening downstages cancers (to stages with improved
survival) as well as preventing them.
As far as we are aware, this is the first study to estimate the
impact of cervical cancer screening on mortality using an
incidence-based case–control study and stage-specific survival.
Combining stage-specific incidence and survival to estimate
mortality is not new; it was proposed by Cuzick et al (Cuzick
et al, 2007) as an appropriate way in which to predict mortality in
cancer screening trials. The combination of stage-specific results to
obtain marginal ORs is novel, but we have shown that it works well
in these data (Table 5). We have also shown that RRs calculated
from
a
case–control
study
of incident
cancer
(with
stage
information recorded) can be combined with external survival
data to estimate the association between a risk factor and cancer
mortality.
As we did not have age- and stage-specific survival for England,
we have used SEER data for the joint dependence on stage and age,
adjusted so the marginals for age-specific survival matched English
estimates. We naively equate one minus the 5-year relative survival
with the probability of dying from cervical cancer. This does not
allow for the possibility that relative survival does not correspond
to cause-specific survival nor for women who die from cervical
cancer 45 years after diagnosis.
It has been suggested that healthy women are more likely to
attend cervical screening (Dugue et al, 2014). Self-selection bias
would result in an overestimation of the reduction in the risk of
death following screening. We previously estimated that the impact
of unrecorded confounders in the audit would be unlikely to
change the results (for incidence) by more than B18% (RR ¼ 0.85;
Castanon et al, 2014).
The estimates of the number of deaths from cervical cancer that
could be prevented by regular screening or that are prevented by
current screening rely on the assumption that the RRs calculated
based on 5-year excess mortality approximate the RRs for cause-
specific mortality. In this study, we group deaths by the age of cancer
diagnosis not the age at death. Hence, screening (starting at age 25)
will (most likely) increase the number of fatal cancers diagnosed at
25 years, even if it reduces (cumulative) cervical cancer mortality.

Impact of cervical cancer screening on mortality

 Under the current screening programme, as the population age a
large number of deaths that are not preventable by screening will
occur after age 84 years, decreasing the relative benefit of screening
overall.
Our model implicitly assumes that stage-specific survival is not
affected by route to diagnosis (screen detected vs non-screen
detected). If anything, it is likely that survival will be better in
screen-detected women; if this corresponds to improved cure rates, it
would cause our estimates to be conservative. Andrae et al (2012)
found that even allowing for lead-time, screen-detected cancer was
more likely to be cured than a symptomatic cancer diagnosed with the
same stage. Similarly, Zucchetto et al (2013) found that stage-specific
survival from cervical cancer among non-screen-detected women was
significantly lower than among those with screen-detected cancer.
These differences could simply be due to lead-time bias (stage 1A and
1B) or failure to differentiate stage II from stage IIIþ cervical cancer,
in which case our approach would not be conservative.
The most direct method of evaluating the effect of screening on
mortality requires individual-level data on survival following cervical
cancer diagnoses, as well as the screening history for those individuals.
We know of three such studies. Vicus et al (2014) analysed 1052
deaths from cervical cancer in Canada, and found that attending
screening in the 3–36 months before cervical cancer diagnosis reduced
mortality by 40–72%, depending on age, but that screening 37–60 or
61–120 months before diagnosis was not associated with any
reduction in risk. Lonnberg et al (2013) analysed data on 506 women
who had died from cervical cancer in 2000–2009. Overall, they
reported a 66% reduction in mortality associated with attending a
single programme screen. Both these studies found little effect of
screening on mortality for young women (under age 40). Rustagi et al
(2014) studied 39 deaths from cervical cancer in women aged 55–79
years, and found that screening in the 7 years before diagnosis was
associated with a 74% reduction in mortality. Compared with the
studies mentioned above, our much larger study found a greater
impact on mortality. This may be a consequence of the high quality of
cervical cytology in England (Cuzick et al, 2006).
In the absence of individual-level mortality and screening data,
it is possible to use trend data to get a very rough estimate of the
impact of screening on mortality by looking at the mortality rate
before the introduction of cervical screening, and the current
mortality rate, incorporating the average screening coverage over
this time period. However, this would not allow for differences in
treatment efficacy over this time, the differential impact for women
who are regularly screened compared with women who are
screened infrequently, nor for changes in the underlying rates of
cervical cancer in the absence of screening. In addition, large
improvements in quality assurance of the programme over the
past 20 years have ensured equal access to expert care that
has improved survival for all women with cervical cancer
(Kitchener, 2008).
To conclude, we have shown that screening has an even larger
impact on cervical cancer mortality than it has on incidence, and
that if everyone attended screening regularly, 83% of cervical
cancer deaths could be prevented, compared with 70% with current
screening. These results are encouraging and should be used to
promote, among women, regular attendance to screening and,
among policy makers, the implementation of organised screening
programmes in areas not yet covered.
