SUMMARY
To provide a detailed analysis of the molecular com-
ponents and underlying mechanisms associated
with ovarian cancer, we performed a comprehensive
mass-spectrometry-based proteomic characteriza-
tion of 174 ovarian tumors previously analyzed by
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), of which 169
were high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs). Inte-
grating
our
proteomic
measurements
with
the
genomic data yielded a number of insights into dis-
ease, such as how different copy-number alterna-
tions influence the proteome, the proteins associated
with chromosomal instability, the sets of signaling
pathways
that
diverse
genome
rearrangements
converge on, and the ones most associated with
short overall survival. Specific protein acetylations
associated with homologous recombination defi-
ciency suggest a potential means for stratifying pa-
tients for therapy. In addition to providing a valuable
resource, these findings provide a view of how the so-
matic genome drives the cancer proteome and asso-
ciations
between
protein
and
post-translational
modification levels and clinical outcomes in HGSC.
INTRODUCTION
A comprehensive molecular view of cancer is necessary for un-
derstanding the underlying mechanisms of disease, improving
prognosis, and ultimately guiding treatment (Hanahan and Wein-
berg, 2011). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) conducted an
extensive
genomic
and
transcriptomic
characterization
of
ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) aimed at defining
the genomic landscape and aiding the development of targeted
therapies for this highly lethal malignancy (Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network, 2011). Key findings from TCGA were: (1) the
prevalent role of TP53 mutations, (2) extensive DNA copy alter-
ations, (3) preliminary transcriptional signatures associated
with survival, (4) varied mechanisms of BRCA1/2 inactivation,
and lastly, (5) CCNE1 aberrations. Subsequent analysis of
genomic data from the TCGA consortium led to the refinement
of the transcript-defined signatures, improving the statistical
association with patient outcome (Yang et al., 2013), and inte-
grating microRNA and mRNA expression profiles associated
with HGSC to identify candidate microRNA targets (Creighton
et al., 2012).
While the insights from genomic analyses are substantial,
functions encoded in the genome are generally executed at the
protein level and are often further modulated by post-transla-
tional modifications (PTMs) (Vogel and Marcotte, 2012). For
example, TCGA used a reverse-phase protein array (RPPA)

755
 analysis of 172 proteins (including 31 phosphoproteins with
phospho-specific antibodies) to generate a signature associated
with the risk of tumor recurrence (Yang et al., 2013). To obtain a
more comprehensive assessment of the complex ovarian HGSC
phenotype, the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium
(CPTAC) conducted an extensive mass-spectrometry (MS)-
based proteomic and phosphoproteomic characterization of
HGSC tumors characterized by TCGA, providing quantitative
measurements for a combined total of 9,600 proteins from 174
tumors (an average of 7,952 proteins per tumor) and a total of
24,429 phosphosites from 6,769 phosphoproteins in a subset
of 69 tumors (an average of 7,677 phosphosites per tumor).
Our results provide insights on HGSC biology and correlate dif-
ferences in protein and PTM levels with a clinical outcome com-
plementary to that of TCGA genomic analyses.
RESULTS
Proteomic Analysis of TCGA HGSC Samples
HGSC biospecimens and clinical data from 174 patients
collected by TCGA were analyzed at two independent CPTAC
centers, Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory (PNNL); 32 samples were analyzed at both
JHU and PNNL. Tumors were selected by examining the associ-
ated TCGA metadata to select tumors either (1) on the basis of
putative homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), defined
by the presence of germline or somatic BRCA1 or BRCA2 muta-
tions, BRCA1 promoter methylation, or homozygous deletion of
PTEN (Woodbine et al., 2014) (122 samples; 67 classified as
HRD, 55 as non-HRD by the aforementioned criteria; JHU); or
(2) to maximize differences in overall survival (84 samples;
PNNL). For selection purposes, short survival was defined as
overall survival of fewer than 3 years, and long survival was
defined as greater than 5 years. All but five tumors had somatic
TP53 mutations, a characteristic feature of HGSC (Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011); these five tumors
were subsequently reclassified as other than HGSC (Vang
et al., 2016) and removed from protein functional analyses
(e.g., subtyping and survival analyses). The tumor selection
criteria and the associated metadata are provided in Table S1.
Proteomics measurements used isobaric tags for relative and
absolute quantitation (iTRAQ; Ross et al., 2004) in conjunction
with offline liquid chromatography fractionation via high-pH
reverse-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) and online RPLC
with high-resolution tandem MS to provide broad coverage for
peptide and protein identification and quantification (Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures); this also alleviated quantita-
tive interference potentially associated with the use of isobaric
tags. We used the relative abundance measurements for each
protein in the 32 patient samples analyzed at both JHU and
PNNL to normalize across the two analysis sites and then used
clustering, principal-component analysis (PCA) and statistical
tests to identify any significant batch effects associated with
the site of analysis (a detailed comparison of within-site, be-
tween-site, and between-sample measurement variability and
the process used to merge the JHU and PNNL data are given
in Figure S1). As shown in Figure S1C, the median coefficient of
variation (CV) between measurements at the two sites was 16%.
A total of 9,600 proteins were identified with high confidence in
all tumors, and the relative abundances in each tumor are given
in Table S2. Functional analyses and proteome-transcriptome
associations were restricted to 3,586 proteins observed and
quantified in all 169 HGSC samples used for protein functional
analyses and where sample variability (signal) exceeded tech-
nical variability (noise) in the merged data (Table S2), calculated
as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. On
average, we identify peptides covering 29% of the amino acids in
any of these 3,586 proteins in a given sample, with a range from
10% to 47%. In addition to protein abundance levels, phospho-
proteomics data were acquired for 69 tumors with a sufficient
sample (Table S2). As with proteins, phosphopeptide abun-
dances were calculated relative to the pooled reference sample.
Because isobaric labeling was performed prior to splitting the
samples for proteome and phosphoproteome analyses, phos-
phopeptide abundance could be corrected for changes in parent
protein abundance to identify differences in the relative extent of
phosphorylation at specific sites for each protein (Table S2).
Overall, we achieved a protein dynamic range encompassing
more than four orders of magnitude, ranging from low-level tran-
scription factors to abundant structural proteins, i.e., actin and
tubulin.
Proteogenomic Landscape of HGSCs
The degree to which alterations observed at the genome and
transcriptome levels are manifested at the protein level is vari-
able, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and partially driven
by multiple levels of post-transcriptional regulation (Zhang
et al., 2014; Kislinger et al., 2006; Jovanovic et al., 2015; Mertins
et al., 2016). To identify peptides encoded by single amino-acid
variants (SAAVs), splice variants, and novel exons documented
by TCGA, mass spectra were searched against a custom graph
database (Woo et al., 2014a) containing all peptide variations
projected from the TCGA genomic analyses of the cohort using
a multi-stage analysis pipeline (Supplemental Experimental Pro-
cedures). The most frequently observed variant peptides repre-
sented SAAVs and gene-level events. The evidence supporting
each novel event is detailed in Table S2, including event type,
genomic location, abundance information, and estimated false
discovery rate (FDR). The validity of these variant peptides was
further evaluated by the synthesis of 20 examples selected at
random across the entire range of spectrum match scores. We
obtained tandem mass spectra for all 20 synthetic peptides
that matched spectra from our analyses, strongly supporting
our observation of these variant peptides; three representative
examples are given in Figure S1E. These results demonstrate
the ability to confidently detect, identify, and validate genome-
level predictions at the protein level. More novel peptides would
likely be observed if there were sufficient samples for more
extensive fractionation and/or replicate analyses (Ruggles
et al., 2016); these limitations preclude any conclusions about
the biological significance of unobserved events. For example,
only two mutant p53 peptides were identified, despite the pres-
ence of p53 mutations in all tumors examined. Such low
coverage can occur for reasons that include: excessively large
or small tryptic fragments, inability to distinguish some amino
acids, some possible biases against highly hydrophobic and
756

 hydrophilic peptides, or low-abundance peptides co-eluting with
very high-abundance peptides.
To assess the potential for post-transcriptional regulation
(e.g., translational efficiency or protein degradation), we com-
pared each protein to its corresponding transcript across all tu-
mors, and correlation was assessed for those pairs with reliable
measurements for both mRNA and protein, i.e., proteins with a
corresponding mRNA measurement observed in all 169 HGSC
tumors where sample variability exceeded technical variability
(3,196 pairs). We excluded 391 proteins observed without a
corresponding mRNA (e.g., HBA1) or discordant gene symbol
annotation in the protein database (e.g., THOC4). Overall,
79.4% of the mRNA-protein pairs showed statistically significant
positive Spearman correlations (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted
p value < 0.01; Figure 1) when changes in mRNA abundance
were compared to changes in relative protein abundance. The
observed median r value of 0.45 for each mRNA-protein pair
across all 169 tumors is similar to those for observations in colo-
rectal cancer (Zhang et al., 2014), breast cancer (Mertins et al.,
2016), and mouse tissues (Kislinger et al., 2006), although less
than those found for cell lines (Wu et al., 2013). In comparison,
the median correlation of paired protein measurements from
the same sample, but measured at two sites, was substantially
higher, at 0.69 (Figure S1).
A wide range of mRNA-protein correlations was observed. In
general, weaker correlations were observed for highly stable
and abundant proteins associated with housekeeping or non-
intrinsic functions (e.g., ribosomes, mRNA splicing, oxidative
phosphorylation, complement cascade), while more dynamic
proteins known to be transcriptionally regulated in response to
nutrient demand or other perturbations (e.g., nucleotide meta-
bolism, amino acid metabolism, acute inflammatory responses)
were more highly correlated (Figure 1; Table S3). This result is
consistent with a previous colorectal cancer study (Zhang
et al., 2014) and supports the hypothesis that, while many biolog-
ical functions are primarily regulated by mRNA abundance, post-
transcriptional mechanisms likely have an important role in regu-
lating certain house-keeping functions (Jovanovic et al., 2015;
Komili and Silver, 2008; Lu et al., 2007; Marguerat et al., 2012).
Additionally, we found that 23 mRNAs lacking poly(A) tails dis-
played lower correlation (mean �0.15) with their cognate proteins
than did polyadenylated mRNAs, consistent with the decreased
stability of mRNAs lacking poly(A) tails (Yang et al., 2011).
Clustering of Tumors Based on Protein Abundance
HGSC is the most common of the four major histological sub-
types of epithelial ovarian cancer and is characterized by distinct
morphological features. Recent studies using mRNA abundance
data have suggested four transcriptomic HGSC subtypes desig-
nated as differentiated, immunoreactive, mesenchymal, and
proliferative (Yang et al., 2013). To build an unbiased molecular
taxonomy of ovarian HGSC, we used protein abundance data
from the 169 tumors to identify subtypes that might show biolog-
ical differences that could be exploited in future studies. Figure 2
shows the resulting clustering analysis of individual tumors (ver-
tical columns) by protein abundance (horizontal rows). The clus-
ter assignment for each sample is provided in Table S4, and a
consensus value matrix for the subtype comparisons is shown
in Figure S2A. The results of a weighted gene co-expression
network analysis (WGCNA) (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008) of
protein functional enrichment by subgroups are provided for
the protein clusters in Figure S2B and Table S4. The enrichment
of KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and Re-
actome ontologies in the WGCNA-derived modules are shown in
Figures S2C and S2D, respectively; membership of enriched
pathways is provided in Table S3.

mRNA and protein were correlated across all the

and 79.4% were significantly correlated (Benja-

pathways and processes showed significantly

 Four of the proteomic clusters showed a clear correspon-
dence to the mesenchymal, proliferative, immunoreactive, and
differentiated subtypes defined by the TCGA transcriptome anal-
ysis (Figure 2; Figure S2E). A relatively small fifth cluster of
tumors—significantly enriched in proteins associated with extra-
cellular matrix interactions, erythrocyte and platelet functions,
and the complement cascade—was also observed using
multiple approaches, including model-based clustering with
Bayesian information criteria, consensus clustering, and Visual
Statistical Data Analyzer (VISDA)-based sub-phenotype clus-
tering. This new group could not be attributed to tissue source
site sampling bias or any other metadata category but may be
related to tumor characteristics, including vascularization and
tumor content, as the tumor purity score for this subtype (and
the mesenchymal subtype) was significantly lower than that of
the other three subtypes (Figure S2F). The clinical relevance of
these protein-based clusters will require validation in indepen-
dent HGSC sample sets, particularly as no significant difference
in survival was observed (Figure S2G), similar to mRNA-based
clustering analysis (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network,
2011).
Proteomic Analysis of CNA Effects
Chromosomal instability, marked by extensive copy-number al-
terations (CNAs) in each tumor, is a hallmark of HGSC and a likely
source of driver alterations in this disease (Cope et al., 2013; Kuo
et al., 2009; Ko
¨ bel et al., 2008). CNAs can affect the abundance
of proteins at the same locus (cis effects) and may also act in
trans either directly or indirectly.
Hypothesizing that CNAs with strong trans effects are more
likely to elicit a molecular phenotype and confer selective advan-
tages, we sought to identify those CNA regions that have the
broadest effect on protein expression. In all, 29,393 CNA loci
(Table S5) were compared to our global proteomics data, with
950,209 CNA/protein pairs (0.72% of the total) exhibiting signif-
icant association (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value < 0.01).
We provide a complete list of the significantly associated pro-
teins for each CNA in Table S5. The diagonal line evident in Fig-
ure 3 corresponds to cis effects, and vertical stripes correspond
to trans effects, in which changes in copy number affect expres-
sion of numerous proteins across the genome. We performed
the same analysis for mRNA to identify sites where associations
are transcriptionally mediated. A similar number of CNA/mRNA
pairs were found to be significantly associated (1,113,164 at a
Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value < 0.01; Figure 3). This
analysis revealed regions on chromosomes 2, 7, 20, and 22
correlated in trans with more than 200 proteins. In contrast to
colorectal cancer, where most of the trans-regulation of protein
by CNA was accompanied by similar changes in mRNA (Zhang
et al., 2014), we observed several loci associated with differ-
ences in protein abundance without a corresponding change in
mRNA. For example, large regions on chromosome 2 have rela-
tively little trans effect on mRNA levels but are associated with
more than 200 proteins in trans. Dissecting the mechanisms by

 which a specific CNA can alter protein levels in trans without
affecting the corresponding mRNA is difficult, given the extent
of the amplified or deleted regions and the numerous genes
affected at a given locus. Possible mechanisms include cis-regu-
lation of proteins associated with mRNA stability and transla-
tional efficiency, such as microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins.
Given the complex pattern of CNAs observed in HGSC, it has
been difficult to identify a limited number of high-impact genomic
alterations that could function as drivers of the disease. We inter-
rogated the trans-affected proteins associated with each puta-
tive CNA for common functions, using pathways defined by
the KEGG, National Cancer Institute Pathway Integration Data-
base (NCI PID), and Reactome database (Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures). Proteins associated with cell invasion and
migration and proteins related to immune function appeared to
be enriched in association with multiple CNAs (Figure S3; Table
S3). These observations suggest a convergence of multiple CNA
targets on a common set of biological functions; namely,
motility/invasion and immune regulation, functions that are
among the hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011).
Association of CNA trans-Affected Proteins with Overall
Survival
Availability of the TCGA survival data allowed us to use trans-
affected protein data from the most influential CNAs (e.g., the
four altered regions described on chromosomes 2, 7, 20, and
22; Figure 3) to build a model of overall survival. Because each
CNA affects many proteins, we used a regression approach
that identifies parsimonious Cox proportional hazards models
with maximal predictive ability from the list of significantly corre-
lated proteins for that CNA. We trained models on the prote-
omics data from PNNL (82 tumors) and tested the ability of the
model to predict survival times in the data from JHU (87 tumors,
not including the 32 overlapping). Each of the four most influen-
tial CNA regions produced models that were strongly associated
with patient survival (p value < 0.01, FDR < 0.5%, based on
randomly selected proteins). A Kaplan-Meier plot illustrating
the predictive value of each of the locus-specific models after
validation is shown in Figure S4A; for the Kaplan-Meier plots,
‘‘high’’ and ‘‘low’’ expression were defined relative to the median
for that signature across all samples, splitting patients into two
equal groups of 45 (Table S6). We examined the overlap in pre-
dictions for patients for the four signatures and found that the
predictions were unanimous (either high or low signature) for
62% of patients and 16% were evenly split, with the remaining
having one dissenting signature. This suggested the utility of
combining these signatures, using a voting method where the
number of high or low calls was counted for each patient; this
substantially improved prediction of survival time (p value =
1.9e�6; Figure 4). We also examined the effects of tumor stage,
tumor grade, patient age, surgical outcome, and platinum status
and found that our proteomic signatures were not improved by
the inclusion of these variables.
For each of these locus-specific models, we analyzed the
enrichment of genes and their regulatory sequences associated
with outcome and found that all four models had genes signifi-
cantly enriched (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value < 0.05)
in binding sites for the proliferation-associated serum response
factor (SRF), suggesting that SRF activity may be important in
ovarian cancer outcome. Additionally, there was significant
enrichment of proteins involved in the regulation of actin cyto-
skeleton, apoptosis, and adherens junction (Benjamini-Hoch-
berg adjusted p value < 0.05). We examined the protein
abundance and phosphorylation status of SRF between short-
and long-surviving groups and observed that they were higher
in short-surviving patients, but only slightly. Thus, although
SRF alone was not predictive, the trends in SRF abundance
and phosphorylation are consistent with the observation of

ber Alterations
The top panel shows the correlation of CNAs to
protein abundance (right) or mRNA (left), with sig-
nificant positive correlations in red and negative
correlations in blue (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted
p value < 0.01, Spearman’s correlation coeffi-
cient). The x axis plots the 29,393 CNAs obtained
from TCGA. The y axis plots 3,202 proteins. Genes
are ordered by chromosomal location on both the
x and y axes. The bottom panel shows the sum-
med number of significantly correlated proteins (or
mRNA) for each individual CNA. In blue is shown
the total number, and in black are those genes
significantly correlated as both mRNA and protein.
Where blue and black lines have similar magni-
tude, e.g., the hotspot on chromosome 20, the
CNA associations are shared between protein and
mRNA. Where a strong blue line has no mirrored
black line, e.g., the protein hotspot on chromo-
some 2, the associations with CNA are largely
unique.

 enrichment for proteins potentially regulated by SRF binding.
Details of the larger gene set analysis are provided in the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Several proteins shared across all the signatures are known to
be involved in cancer processes. Catenin B2 (CTNNA2) is a cell-
cell adhesion protein and tumor suppressor (Fanjul-Ferna
´ ndez
et al., 2013). The Rho guanosine diphosphate (GDP) dissociation
inhibitor (GDI) beta (ARHGDIB) is involved in invasion and
migration in many cancers, and overexpression correlates with
progression in pancreatic carcinoma (Yi et al., 2015). Protein
kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons protein 2
(PACSIN2) is a repressor of cellular migration (Meng et al.,
2011). Finally, the guanosine-triphosphate (GTP)-binding nu-
clear protein RAN is a prognostic marker associated with
increased survival in epithelial ovarian cancer (Barre
` s et al.,
2010). The association of these previously described survival-
related proteins with genes affected in trans by CNAs suggests
a potential mechanism for the parallel activation of multiple path-
ways associated with poor prognosis in HGSC.
As a comparison, we applied the previously described Provar
signature (Yang et al., 2013), comprising five proteins and four
phosphoproteins that showed good survival prediction in the
TCGA ovarian cancer dataset. We observed all proteins in the
Provar signature in our proteomic data, but only one of the phos-
phosites (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] Y1173). Thus,
we used the RPPA data from the original signature (Figure S4B).
We found that the Provar signature was prognostic of survival
(Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value = 0.11) in the 67 patients
examined here (those with phosphoprotein data had somatic
TP53 mutations), but the statistical power of Provar is not as
high as the statistical power of signatures derived from the
CNA trans-affected proteins in this dataset. In addition, inte-
grating the Provar signature with the CNA signatures did not
improve survival prediction (Figure S4C).
Identification of Proteins Associated with Chromosomal
Structural Abnormality
The degree of chromosomal instability exhibited by a tumor can
be represented by a calculated chromosome instability (CIN) in-
dex, as described previously for lung cancer (Cancer Genome
Atlas Research Network, 2012). Identification of proteins associ-
ated with CIN may provide information on the processes
contributing to chromosomal instability, while the analysis of
trans-affected proteins described earlier is more closely related
to the downstream consequences of specific CNAs. Using a
bootstrapping method described in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures, we identified a proteomic signature, including 128
proteins (Table S7) showing significant correlation with the CIN
index (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value < 1e�4, Spearman
correlation; Figure S5A). Functional annotation of these proteins
(Figure S5B) showed that proteins upregulated in tumors with a
high CIN index were preferentially involved in chromatin organi-
zation (p value = 6.90e�5), whereas proteins upregulated in tu-
mors with a low CIN index were more often associated with cell
death (p value = 2.13e�5). Correlation analysis of protein abun-
dances and CIN indicated that a small number of proteins could
account for the majority of the CIN (Figure 5); two of the most
strongly associated proteins, CHD4 and CHD5, are known to
be involved in chromatin organization (Liu and Matulonis, 2014).

model on the samples from PNNL, and shown are the survival curves from
these models applied to the non-overlapping data from the JHU analysis, with
the up (red; above the median) and down (blue, below the median) signatures
each representing 45 patients. A vote was taken among the four most pre-

 Identification of Proteins Associated with HRD Status
Since HRD is associated with susceptibility to poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and improved survival (Farmer
et al., 2005; Liu and Matulonis, 2014), we sought to elucidate
systemic changes associated with HRD and identify biomarkers
that might be used to stratify patients for treatment. We defined
tumors with HRD as having either germline or somatic mutations
in BRCA1 or BRCA2, or BRCA1 promoter methylation, or homo-
zygous deletion of PTEN (McEllin et al., 2010), with an overall
survival of >1.5 years, while non-HRD patients were defined as
lacking these genomic aberrations, with a follow-up or time to
death of <2.5 years; additional selection criteria include available
residual tissue volume and a tumor tissue contamination score
estimated using CNAs (Yu et al., 2011). Applying differential de-
pendency network (DDN) analysis (Zhang et al., 2009) on a set of
171 BRCA1- or BRCA2-related proteins curated from the litera-
ture and from the cBio portal, we identified a sub-network of 30
proteins that displayed co-expression patterns differentiating
HRD from non-HRD patients (Figure 6; Table S7). Several of
the proteins in these modules are known to be involved in histone
acetylation or deacetylation, e.g., HDAC1, RBBP4, RBBP7,
EP300 (Mielcarek et al., 2015), and HUS1 (Cai et al., 2000).
Although statistical association cannot distinguish between
drivers and consequences of HRD status, the observed enrich-
ment of proteins associated with histone acetylation motivated
us to use an effective database search strategy (Supplemental
Experimental Procedures) to identify and quantify acetylated
peptides from the global proteomic data. Comparative analysis
of 399 acetylated peptides identified 15 acetylated peptides
with significant differences between the HRD and non-HRD
samples (Table S7). Among these, dual acetylation at K12 and

Figure 6. DDN Analysis and Lysine-Acetyla-
tion Analysis between HRD and Non-HRD
Patients
DDN analysis revealed a sub-network of proteins
that displayed distinct co-expression patterns
between HRD and non-HRD patients, where pur-
ple connections indicate protein correlations that
exist only in HRD samples and blue connections
indicate protein correlations that exist only in non-
HRD patients. The links between the nodes are
drawn with two different thicknesses, indicative of
whether the connections meet the significance
threshold of 0.05 (thin lines) or 0.01 (thick lines).
Proteins with blue dotted circles are known to be
involved in histone acetylation or deacetylation.
Furthermore, identification and quantitation of
lysine-acetylated peptides in global proteomics
data showed that acetylation levels at K12 and
K16 of histone H4 are significantly different be-
tween HRD and non-HRD samples, suggesting a
role of histone H4 acetylation (together with
HDAC1) in modulating the choice of DSB repair
mechanisms.
K16 of histone H4 showed a significant
difference between HRD and non-HRD
samples (Figure 6); differential acetylation
of K12 and K16 was verified using syn-
thetic peptides and targeted analysis using sequential windowed
data-independent acquisition of the total high-resolution mass
spectra (SWATH-MS). In cell-line data, acetylation of H4
has previously been reported to be involved in the choice of
DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways (homologous
recombination or non-homologous end joining (Gong and Miller,
2013; Tang et al., 2013). This relationship is regulated partially by
HDAC1, a protein also identified in the DDN analysis. We
observed a significant enrichment of HDAC1 and its co-regu-
lated proteins in tumors with HRD and low H4 acetylation relative
to non-HRD tumors with high H4 acetylation (DDN analysis: per-
mutation tests, p value < 0.05; differentially acetylated peptides:
t tests, p value < 0.05, with an estimated FDR < 0.5% by
bootstrap/permutation tests). The combined observations of
increased HDAC1 and associated proteins at the pathway level,
together with decreased acetylation of H4 in HRD patients at the
PTM level, provide insight regarding the potential role of HDAC1
in modulating the choice of DSB repair pathways.
Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Pathways Associated
with Survival
An initial set of 24,464 different phosphopeptides (21,298 unique
phosphorylation sites) contained within 4,420 proteins having
data on net differences in phosphorylation (Table S2) was ob-
tained. Since ischemia of the TCGA tumor samples may alter
phosphopeptide abundance, we removed any phosphorylation
sites previously shown to be altered by ischemia (Mertins
et al., 2014). We also removed three tumor samples having sub-
stantially higher than average missing values and two tumor
samples lacking somatic TP53 mutations (Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures). This yielded a final set of 7,675 different
Cell 166, 755–765, July 28, 2016
761
 phosphopeptides (6,802 unique phosphorylation sites) from
2,324 proteins (Table S2) that were mapped to pathways via
the NCI PID. The average net phosphorylation of all phospho-
peptides mapping to a given pathway (i.e., the statistical average
across all phosphoproteins known to be in the pathway rather
than the statistically significant individual proteins) was used as
a measure of pathway activity and compared between short sur-
vivors (deceased, having survived <3 years; n = 17) and long sur-
vivors (patients surviving >5 years; n = 19), using both proteomic
and phosphoproteomic data.
An issue in ranking the pathways is the distinction between
phosphopeptides that are unique to a single pathway, such as
the receptor peptides themselves, and peptides that map to pro-
teins shared between pathways. In order to address this issue,
we performed two analyses: one of all proteins associated with
a specific pathway in the NCI PID and a second analysis in which

tional data for the same samples that
yielded only one statistically significantly

plemental Experimental Procedures). All
pathways indicated in Figure 7A were
increased in association with short sur-
vival relative to long survival, though
some individual components within a
pathway
showed
opposite
changes
(e.g., JNK1 transcript and protein levels,
see Figure 7B). The RhoA-regulatory, PDGFRB, and integrin-
like kinase pathways emerged as the most activated in this anal-
ysis (Figure 7A). Figure 7B shows the common and unique
elements of the PDGFRB pathway and the trends in mRNA, pro-
tein, and phosphoprotein levels in the comparison of short
versus long survivors, illustrating the benefit of combined protein
and phosphoprotein measurements, as well as the substantial
contribution of protein phosphorylation data to the overall
analysis.
We compared our results to the 31 phosphoproteins repre-
sented on the RPPA arrays used in the original TCGA ovarian can-
cer analysis (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011);
RPPA identified differential phosphorylation of ERK1, RAF1,
and STAT3 in the same patient samples analyzed by MS. For
short-surviving versus long-surviving patients, ERK1 showed sta-
tistically significantly increased phosphorylation by RPPA, on the
762
Cell 166, 755–765, July 28, 2016
 same ERK1 phosphopeptides as found using MS, while AKT1,
RAF1, and STAT3 showed increased phosphorylation by both
RPPA and MS-based analyses but based upon distinct phospho-
peptides (Table S2). Good overlap was observed between RPPA
and MS results for phosphoproteins on the RPPA array, but we
did not observe three of the specific phosphosites from the Provar
survival signature in our MS data, suggesting that proteomics is
more sensitive to overall pathway activity than specific regulatory
events in the pathway itself. However, many of the phosphopepti-
des identified by MS phosphoproteomics as components of the
PDGFR-beta pathway were not represented in the RPPA, illus-
trating the ability to identify phosphorylation events not readily
accessible with currently available antibodies (Figure 7B).
DISCUSSION
The addition of proteomic information, including PTMs, to the
rich genomic and transcriptomic data available from the ovarian
HGSC samples analyzed by TCGA has provided additional in-
sights into the biology of HGSC, including the identification of
changes at the level of pathway activation. Integration of
genomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic measurements
identified differentially regulated pathways and functional mod-
ules that displayed significant associations with patient out-
comes, including survival and HRD status. Cox proportional
hazard analysis of proteins associated with CNAs identified
overall survival signatures enriched for targets of the prolifera-
tion-associated transcription factor SRF, and integrated proteo-
mic, phosphoproteomic, and transcriptomic data identified
pathways that differentiated patients on the basis of survival,
including the PDGFR-beta signaling pathway associated with
angiogenesis, the RhoA regulatory and integrin-linked kinase
pathways associated with cell mobility and invasion, and path-
ways associated with chemokine signaling and adaptive immu-
nity. Proteins associated with cell invasion and motility emerged
from both the integration of CNAs with protein abundance data
and the phosphoproteomic investigation of upregulated path-
ways in short versus long survivors. Despite the complexity of
genomic alterations that characterize HGSC, these analyses
suggest a functional convergence on a subset of key pathways.
The association of increased invasiveness and motility with short
overall survival in this study may help to explain more aggressive
mechanisms of dissemination in ovarian cancer, including
recently reported hematogenous metastasis (Pradeep et al.,
2014), in addition to previously described lymphatic spread
and known peritoneal spread by direct extension.
Focusing on functional modules has also revealed potential
drivers of HGSC and more robust signatures for potentially strat-
ifying ovarian HGSC patients into distinct cancer phenotypes to
inform therapeutic management. For example, the identification
of specific acetylation events associated with HRD, e.g., the
simultaneous acetylation of K12 and K16 on histone H4, may
provide an alternative biomarker of HRD and a rationale for the
selection of patients in future clinical trials of HDAC inhibitors,
alone or in combination with PARP inhibition. This may help to
resolve the current discrepancy between the initial observation
of limited single-agent activity of HDAC inhibitors in ovarian can-
cer (Mackay et al., 2010; Modesitt et al., 2008) and more recent
findings of a >40% response rate when used in combination with
cytotoxic chemotherapy in platinum-resistant patients (Dizon
et al., 2012). Similarly, comprehensive interrogation of protein
phosphorylation identified multiple pathways with significantly
increased phosphorylation in patients with poor clinical out-
comes. Specifically, the observed activation of PDGFR path-
ways in a subset of patients with short overall survival could
potentially stratify patients for selective enrollment in trials of
anti-angiogenic therapy, which is particularly relevant to current
controversies over the use of bevacuzimab as a first-line therapy
in ovarian cancer (Gadducci et al., 2015).
Overall, this work illustrates the ability of proteomics to com-
plement genomics in providing additional insights into pathways
and processes that drive ovarian cancer biology and how these
pathways are altered in correspondence with clinical pheno-
types. The comprehensive proteomic measurements for the
HGSC tumor samples provide a public resource of information.
Importantly, the ability to identify PTMs revealed a strong asso-
ciation between specific histone acetylation events and the HRD
phenotype. In addition, the enhanced view of pathway activity
provided by measurements of protein phosphorylation provides
a foundation for linking genotype to proteotype and, ultimately,
to phenotype for understanding the molecular basis of cancer.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Full methods are available in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Tumor Samples
All tumor samples for the present study were obtained through the TCGA Bio-
specimen Core Resource, as described previously (Zhang et al., 2014). Sam-
ples were selected based on overall survival, HRD status, and availability.
Quantitative Proteomics
Tissue proteins were extracted and digested with trypsin; at each site, a portion
of each resulting sample was also used to create a pooled reference in which
each tumor sample contributed an equal percentage by peptide mass. The
pooled reference sample was included in each multiplexed, isobaric labeling
experiment to enable cross-experiment comparison in the entire sample cohort.
The patient samples and the pooled reference sample were each labeled
by different iTRAQ reagents (Sciex), combined, fractionated, and split for
integrated, quantitative global proteome (10%) and phosphoproteome (90%)
analysis using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) on an Orbitrap Velos mass spec-
trometer (Thermo Scientific). Raw data were processed for peptide identification
by database searching, and identified peptides were assembled as proteins and
mapped to gene identifiers for proteogenomic comparisons. Quantitation was
achieved by comparing the iTRAQ reporter ion intensities in each sample.
Comparison of mRNA and Protein Subtypes
A model-based clustering approach was used to model the protein abundance
data as a mixture of subtypes. Bayesian information criteria, statistical resam-
pling, and VISDA-based sub-phenotype clustering approaches provided
similar results, with a stable optimization on five clusters as determined by
consensus clustering. WGCNA analysis was performed to infer genes or
gene networks that drive subtyping into five clusters, followed by correlation
with subtype as a trait.
Integration of Proteomics and CNA Data
Spearman correlation coefficients and corresponding adjusted p values
were calculated for each protein/transcript by CNA locus, and gene set enrich-
ment analysis was used to infer function for groups of proteins significantly
correlated with a given CNA locus. Regression analysis was applied to
the list of trans-affected proteins correlated with each CNA to generate
Cell 166, 755–765, July 28, 2016
763
 parsimonious Cox proportional hazards models with maximal predictive abil-
ity, using the PNNL data for training and JHU data for testing. Kaplan-Meier
plots were used to visualize performance in predicting overall survival and pro-
gression-free survival. A CIN index (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network,
2012) was calculated for each sample as the mean absolute values of copy-
number measurements at the 29,393 selected loci. Bootstrap resampling
was used to select proteins correlated with CIN index at high confidence.
Protein Acetylation and HRD
Acetylated peptides were identified by searching the global proteomics data
for dynamic acetylation to lysines (+42 Da). Acetylation levels were compared
between HRD and non-HRD cases by t test. Targeted proteomics (SWATH;
Collins et al., 2013) was used to orthogonally quantify the acetylated peptide
with synthetic peptides as the internal standard.
Survival-Related Pathways Analysis
Phosphoproteome data from the short and long survivors were mapped to
signaling pathways in the NCI Pathway Information Database (PID) (http://
pid.nci.nih.gov) using the gene names. For each signaling pathway in the
PID, relative abundances for all phosphopeptides mapping to any pathway
component were identified and separated into short- and long-survivor
groups. The difference in distributions between the two sets of pathway-spe-
cific peptides, i.e., those associated with either short survivors or long survi-
vors, was then assessed using a two-tailed t test. Similar enrichment analyses
were also performed using protein abundance, mRNA abundance, and CNA.
