abstract
BACKGROUND: Trial discontinuation and nonpublication represent potential waste in research 
resources and lead to compromises in medical evidence. Pediatric trials may be particularly 
vulnerable to these outcomes given the challenges encountered in conducting trials in 
children. We aimed to determine the prevalence of discontinuation and nonpublication of 
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted in pediatric populations.
METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional study of pediatric RCTs registered in ClinicalTrials.
gov from 2008 to 2010. Data were collected from the registry and associated publications 
identified (final search on September 1, 2015).
RESULTS: Of 559 trials, 104 (19%) were discontinued early, accounting for an estimated 8369 
pediatric participants. Difficulty with patient accrual (37%) was the most commonly cited 
reason for discontinuation. Trials were less likely to be discontinued if they were funded 
by industry compared with academic institutions (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.27–0.77). Of the 455 completed trials, 136 (30%) were not published, 
representing 69 165 pediatric participants. Forty-two unpublished trials posted results 
on ClinicalTrials.gov. Trials funded by industry were more than twice as likely to result in 
nonpublication at 24 and 36 months (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.35–3.64; OR 3.12, 95% CI 1.6–6.08, 
respectively) and had a longer mean time to publication compared with trials sponsored by 
academia (33 vs 24 months, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of pediatric RCTs, discontinuation and nonpublication were 
common, with thousands of children exposed to interventions that did not lead to 
informative or published findings. Trial funding source was an important determinant of 
these outcomes, with both academic and industry sponsors contributing to inefficiencies.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Discontinuation 
and nonpublication of randomized clinical trials 
raise both ethical and scientifi
 c concerns. Previous 
research has shown that these practices are 
common among clinical trials performed in adults 
but are less well defi
 ned in pediatric populations.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Our study is an extensive 
examination of discontinuation and nonpublication 
of pediatric RCTs. The high rates of both these 
outcomes indicate that there is substantial waste 
of both human and fi
 nancial resources in current 
pediatric clinical research.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
provide the highest level of evidence 
to inform clinical practice and are 
dependent on the enrollment of 
human subjects who volunteer for 
participation, even though they may 
not directly benefit from the study 
findings. 
1 Trial sponsors have an 
obligation to participants not only to 
minimize potential harms but also 
to conduct research with the highest 
ethical standards and rigor and 
report study findings publicly and in 
a timely fashion. 
1 
– 
3 Failure to do so 
represents a breach of contract with 
participants and a waste of limited 
human and material resources. 
Furthermore, the nonpublication 
of trial findings compromises 
the available medical evidence 
by distorting the apparent safety 
and efficacy of interventions, and 
undermining clinical guidelines and 
evidence-based clinical practice.1, 
 
4 
– 
6
Over the past 2 decades, substantial 
investments have been made 
to increase transparency and 
accountability in human subject 
research. In 1997, the US Congress 
passed the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) Modernization 
Act, which mandates public access 
to information about clinical trials 
for patients with “serious or life-
threatening” medical illnesses. 
7 This 
was followed by the establishment 
in 2000 of ClinicalTrials.gov, a Web-
based, publicly available registry 
of clinical studies. A number of 
policies and regulations have made 
registration of interventional 
trials obligatory, and registration 
has become standard practice. 
ClinicalTrials.gov is the most 
comprehensive database of clinical 
trials conducted in the United States 
and internationally, 
 
8, 
 
9 and there 
is evidence suggesting that it has 
positively influenced the reporting 
of clinical trials involving human 
subjects. 
10, 
11
Despite these heightened ethical 
and legislative mandates, the 
discontinuation and nonpublication 
of clinical trials remains 
common. 
12 
 
 
– 
17 Pediatric trials may 
be particularly vulnerable to these 
outcomes because they face unique 
challenges in terms of concerns 
around testing interventions 
in children and the logistics of 
recruiting and consenting research 
subjects in collaboration with 
parents and caretakers. In addition, 
there has historically been more 
limited funding allotted to pediatric 
research, both by industry and 
nonprofit sponsors, posing additional 
challenges to the successful 
conduct of trials. 
18 Analyses of trial 
discontinuation and nonpublication 
have primarily focused on adult 
populations, 
 
12 
 
– 
16 and the prevalence 
of these outcomes for pediatric 
RCTs remains less well defined. 
17 
Accordingly, the aim of this study was 
to determine the frequency of trial 
discontinuation and nonpublication 
for RCTs conducted in pediatric 
populations.
METHODS
Data Source
We conducted a cross-sectional study 
of randomized pediatric clinical 
trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Trial entries provide details on the 
study population, intervention type, 
start and completion dates, funding 
source, design characteristics, 
and current recruitment status. 
Investigators must periodically 
update the record, 
 
19 with public 
availability of archived versions 
tracking all changes and additions to 
the entry.
We limited our analyses to 
randomized trials studying children 
(birth–age 17 years) and registered 
between January 1, 2008, and 
December 31, 2010, and selected 
trials that were completed or had 
been discontinued by December 31, 
2012 ( 
Fig 1). This corresponded to 
recruitment statuses of “completed, 
” 
“terminated, 
” “withdrawn, 
” or 
“suspended” (Supplemental Table 
7). 
20 Trials that were registered 
>60 days after the start date were 
excluded to avoid biases in the 
sample related to investigator 
decisions after initial trial findings. 
13
The ClinicalTrials.gov query was 
performed on a single day (February

updates to database records. The 
Institutional Review Board at Boston 
Children’s Hospital determined that 
this study was exempt from review.
Defi
 nitions and Data 
Characterization
Definitions for data elements in 
ClinicalTrials.gov were used as per 
the Glossary of Common Site Terms 
20 
and ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Data 
Element Definitions 
21 (Supplemental 
Table 7). Certain data elements were 
further categorized for the purposes 
of our analysis.
All conditions under study were 
classified using a modified version of 
the 2010 Global Burden of Disease 
hierarchical disease and injury cause 
list. 
22 The age of study participants 
was categorized into “preterm, 
newborn, and infant, 
” “toddler and 
preschool, 
” “school age, 
” “adolescent, 
” 
and “mixed ages” on the basis of the 
age eligibility criteria and the details 
provided in the trial description.
Organizations listed as sponsors and 
collaborators of a study considered 
the funders of the study (see 
Supplemental Table 7). In cases 
where >1 sponsor was listed, the 
lead sponsor was considered to be 
the primary funder. 
20, 
 
21, 
 
23 Primary 
funding sources are categorized 
in ClinicalTrials.gov as industry, 
government (National Institutes 
of Health and other US federal 
agencies), or “other, 
” which includes 
academic institutions, nonprofit 
research networks, and non–US 
government sponsors. We reviewed 
all trials that were designated as 
“other” and identified those that were 
funded by an academic institution 
to create a new funding variable. 
Trials were therefore considered to 
be funded by “industry, 
” “academic 
institutions, 
” or “other, 
” which 
included all government-funded 
trials (including non–US federal 
agencies), as well as the remaining 
trials originally labeled as “other.”
Trials were characterized as small 
(<100 participants), midsize (100–
499 participants), or large (>500 
participants). 
13 Archived entries of 
each trial were queried to extract 
the planned enrollment figures 
before commencement of subject 
recruitment and the actual number 
of enrolled participants at the time of 
trial completion or discontinuation. 
24
Time to publication was defined 
as the interval between “primary 
completion date” (Supplemental 
Table 7), and the date the publication 
appeared in print or as an electronic 
publication, whichever occurred 
first. If the primary completion 
date was missing (n = 2), the study 
“completion date” was used. 
25
Reasons for trial discontinuation 
were tabulated based on data 
provided in ClinicalTrials.gov 
entries and e-mail correspondence 
with study investigators when this 
information was missing or unclear. 
Conduct problems were defined 
as technical or logistical issues 
compromising trial completion. 
Difficulties with obtaining approval 
by institutional review boards 
or other regulatory bodies were 
considered regulatory issues. Trial 
discontinuation due to safety or 
efficacy findings, or changes in 
standard of care, were considered 
informative terminations. 
26
Publication Search
All trial entries were reviewed to 
identify publications automatically 
added to the trial record via the 
national clinical trial (NCT) identifier 
number. If a publication was not 
listed in the publication field of 
the entry, Medline was searched 
via PubMed independently by 
both authors (NP and FB) using 
NCT number, trial title, author 
names, institutions, and study 
keywords. Articles were linked 
to the corresponding trials based 
on comparison of the trial data 
provided in the registry entry and 
in the abstract or full manuscript, 
when necessary. If a publication was 
not identified in Medline, the same 
search protocol was used in Embase 
and GoogleScholar. For industry-
sponsored trials, we also reviewed 
company Web sites for information 
on trial publications.
If we were unable to match a trial to a 
publication, we attempted to contact 
study investigators and sponsors 
to inquire about publication status. 
E-mail addresses were collected 
from the registry entries and 
from previous publications by the 
investigators. A standardized e-mail 
was sent, with 1 follow-up e-mail 
if no response was received. 
12 For 
trials that listed only a sponsoring 
company name, responsible 
individuals were contacted by e-mail, 
online form, or telephone as per 
company Web site instructions.
We considered a trial published 
if it was associated with a peer-
reviewed manuscript describing 
trial findings. 
12, 
 
13 Trials were 
considered unpublished if we were 
unable to identify a publication 
and trial investigators informed 
us that the trial was unpublished, 
did not respond to our inquiries, 
or did not have valid contact 
information that we were able to 
locate. 
12 A final search for all trials 
without publications was completed 
on September 1, 2015, allowing 
for a minimum of 32 months for 
manuscript submission, review, and 
publication.
Statistical Analyses
χ2 tests were used to assess 
associations between trial 
characteristics and trial completion 
and publication status. We used 
logistic regression models to assess 
the impact of primary funding source 
on trial discontinuation and on trial 
nonpublication at 24 and 36 months 
after trial completion, controlling 
for trial design variables previously 
shown to impact trial completion 
and eventual publication. 
12 
– 
14 These 
variables were prespecified and

included intervention type, age of 
study participants, masking, and 
sample size. Age of study participants 
was not found to be significant in 
any of the models and was dropped 
from the final models to minimize 
overfitting. This did not substantially 
change the results. Student t test was 
used to compare time to publication 
according to funding source. 
Statistical significance was set at 
P < .05. All statistical analyses were 
conducted by using SAS (version 9.4, 
SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Trial Characteristics
We identified 559 randomized 
pediatric clinical trials that met 
inclusion criteria for our analysis 
( 
Fig 1). Nearly a quarter of all 
trials studied childhood vaccines 
and another 8% examined other 
interventions for common childhood 
infectious diseases ( 
Table 1). Drugs/
biologics (67.8%) were the most 
frequently investigated interventions 
( 
Table 2). The predominant sources 
of funding were academic institutions 
(43.8%) and industry (48.7%). Fifty-
three percent of trials were designed 
as double-blind studies, with 33.5% 
conducted as open-label trials. The 
median planned sample size was 
159 (interquartile range 60–424) 
with 37.9% of trials anticipating 
enrollment of <100 participants 
and 21.5% planning to enroll >500 
participants.
Discontinuation of Pediatric Clinical 
Trials
A total of 104 trials (19%) were 
discontinued. Thirty-six were 
withdrawn before participant 
recruitment, whereas 5 were 
suspended and 63 terminated 
after participants had already been 
enrolled. In total, an estimated 8369 
children were enrolled in trials 
that were never completed. Patient 
accrual (n = 38, 36.5%) was cited 
to be the most common reason, 
followed by conduct problems 
(n = 13, 12.5%) and informative 
termination, (n = 13, 12.5%). Notably, 
funding issues were the least likely 
to be cited as reasons for trial 
discontinuation (n = 5, 4.8%;  
Table 3).
In univariate analyses, primary 
funding source (P = .044), and 
planned sample size (P < .001) were 
found to be significant determinants 
of trial discontinuation ( 
Table 2). 
Fewer trials funded by industry were 
discontinued (39.4%) compared 
with those with academic affiliations 
(54.8%). In multivariate analysis, 
funding source and sample size 
remained significant determinants 
of trial discontinuation ( 
Table 
4). Trials primarily funded by 
industry were less likely to result in 
discontinuation compared with those 
funded by academic sources (odds 
ratio [OR] 0.46, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.27–0.77, P = .004). 
Larger trials were also less likely to 
be discontinued (OR 0.999, 95% CI 
0.998–1.0).
Nonpublication of Pediatric Clinical 
Trials
Among all trials that were completed, 
136 (29.8%) remained unpublished 
after a mean of 58 months between 
trial completion and publication 
search. These trials accounted for 
an estimated 69 165 pediatric trial 
participants, representing 27% of 
the total study population among 
completed trials. Among these 
unpublished trials, 42 (30.8%) had 
results posted in the registry.
In univariate analyses, intervention 
type and primary funding source 
were found to be associated with 
nonpublication at 24 months; at 36 
months, primary funding source 
was associated with nonpublication 
( 
Table 5). In multivariate analyses, 
industry funding was associated with 
a greater than twofold increase in the 
odds of nonpublication at 24 months 
compared with academic institutions 
(OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.35–3.64; P = .002) 
and a greater than threefold increase 
at 36 months (OR 3.12, 95% CI 1.60–
6.08, P < .001) ( 
Table 6).
The mean time to publication for all 
trials was 29 months (95% CI 28–31 
months), with a longer mean time 
to publication for trials funded by 
industry compared with academic 
institutions (33 months vs 24 
months, respectively, P < .001).

DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrates that among 
interventional trials conducted 
in children, trial discontinuation 
and nonpublication are common. 
We found that 19% of trials were 
discontinued, two-thirds of which 
had already enrolled participants 
at the time of trial termination. 
Poor recruitment and problems 
with the conduct of the trial were 
among the most commonly reported 
reasons for trial discontinuation.

Furthermore, after a mean of 58 
months since completion, 30% of 
trials remained unpublished. In 
all, >69 000 children, representing 
nearly a third of the total population 
enrolled in completed trials, were 
exposed to interventions without 
subsequent publication of trial 
findings. Our study shows that 
trial sponsors were an important 
determinant of these outcomes, with 
trials funded by industry less likely

to be discontinued but more likely 
to remain unpublished 24 and 36 
months after trial completion.
Children have historically been 
underrepresented in clinical trials 
compared with adults, and a number 
of FDA policies aim to incentivize and 
increase the study of interventions in 
pediatric populations. These include 
the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children 
Act and the Pediatric Research Equity 
Act, which have been credited with 
increasing the number of pediatric 
drug trials and the number of drug 
labels that contain pediatric safety 
and efficacy information. 
18, 
 
27, 
 
28 Our 
findings indicate that once trials are 
initiated, additional focus is needed 
to maximize the knowledge gain from 
pediatric trial participation.
A number of trials were discontinued 
for reasons considered informative, 
including preliminary safety and 
efficacy findings or changes in the 
standard of care that occurred after 
the trial had been initiated. Such 
termination likely prevents further 
wasted resources and may be 
unavoidable at a certain baseline rate. 
However, there may be opportunities 
to reduce noninformative trial 
discontinuation, such as poor patient 
accrual and technical or logistical 
issues with trial conduct. Difficulties 
with trial enrollment have previously 
been documented among adult trials 
and cited as the most common factor 
for trial discontinuation. 
12, 
 
14, 
 
26 The 
rate of discontinuation of pediatric 
trials (19%) was comparable to 
rates found in adult populations 
(21%–25%), 
 
12, 
14 indicating that the 
potential challenges encountered 
with pediatric patient recruitment 
do not appear to increase the odds of 
trial discontinuation.
Trials sponsored by industry were 
less likely to be discontinued. This 
may be related to additional financial 
and human resources available 
in industry-funded trials, such as 
research coordinators to manage 
patient recruitment or technical 
infrastructure to facilitate trial 
conduct. For academic trials in 
particular, investigators and research 
oversight committees should be 
accountable for ensuring that 
clinical trials are feasible and have 
the material and human resources 
available to achieve the proposed 
goals.
The nonpublication of trial findings 
represents a violation of the ethical 
imperative to share results of trials 
that involve human subjects and 
also introduces publication bias 
into the medical literature. 
1, 
 
4 
– 
6 
Nonpublication has been examined 
across a range of trial types, with 
rates predominantly between 25% 
and 35%.12 
 
 
 
–17 This is consistent with 
our findings of a nonpublication 
rate of 30%. Trial nonpublication 
is particularly concerning given the 
limited availability of volunteers for 
clinical trials and the high rates of 
trial termination due to difficulties 
in participant accrual. Similar 
to previous work, we found that 
industry sponsorship was associated 
with nonpublication and delay in 
publication of trial results. 
6, 
 
12 
– 
14, 
16, 
 
17 
However, nonpublication was also 
high for trials funded by academic 
institutions, which arguably have 
an even greater mandate to uphold 
the standards of clinical trial reports 
underpinning evidence-based 
clinical decision-making. This finding 
is in accordance with previous 
work that has shown poor rates of 
dissemination of clinical trial findings 
across leading academic medical 
centers. 
29
The Declaration of Helsinki, which 
is the central document governing 
regulation of human subjects 
research, states that investigators 
are responsible for the public 
dissemination of trial results 
involving human participants, 
regardless of the findings. 
3 There is 
some evidence that trial registration 
has contributed to an increase in the 
publication of trials with negative 
results, thus curbing publication 
bias related to preferential reporting 
of positive findings. 
10, 
 
11 However, 
given persistent high rates of trial 
nonpublication across funding types, 
additional mechanisms are needed 
to increase trial publication or make 
trial results publicly available to 
facilitate analysis and reporting 
by other investigators. One such 
initiative is RIAT (Restoring Invisible 
and Abandoned Trials), which has 
garnered support from a number of 
high-profile journals. 
30 This proposal 
invites researchers with unpublished 
trials to signal their intent to publish 
the trial within a year or else provide 
public access to their trial results and 
offer the opportunity to independent 
investigators to become “restorative 
authors.”31, 
 
32
It is of note that the FDA 
Amendments Act of 2007 requires 
study results to be reported but does 
not specifically require publication. 
Trials can therefore fulfill this 
mandate through results reporting 
in ClinicalTrials.gov. Of note, 42 of 
the 136 unpublished trials reported 
results on ClinicalTrials.gov, 
although these data were not always 
interpretable because they were 
often without statistical analysis 
or without clarification of the 
hypothesis tested, making it difficult 
to draw substantive conclusions. 
Although any dissemination of results 
has value, we chose to focus on 
whether trial results were published 
in peer-reviewed journals because 
this represents the most widely 
accessible and commonly used 
information source for physicians 
seeking to apply trial results to their 
clinical practice. The peer-review 
process also ensures that trial results 
are rigorously scrutinized and 
ensures appropriate interpretation of 
the results.
Several limitations should be noted 
when interpreting our findings. This 
study analyzed only trials registered 
in ClincialTrials.gov; it is possible 
that there were additional pediatric 
interventional trials that were not 
captured in our analysis. The rate

of nonregistration of pediatric trials 
is unknown, but it is unlikely that 
these trials would have a higher 
rate of completion or publication 
given federal and editorial policies 
mandating registration. It should 
also be noted that information in the 
registry is provided by investigators 
and sponsors, and we were not able 
to verify the accuracy of the trial 
data. This issue is mitigated in part 
by automated data validity checks 
and manual review by ClinicalTrials.
gov staff to ensure data accuracy 
before public posting. 
33 There were 
missing data in the registry such 
as trial phase and reasons for trial 
discontinuation, which we were 
unable to complete despite efforts 
to contact investigators. Finally, it is 
possible that we did not identify all 
publications associated with trials in 
our cohort. However, we employed 
a rigorous approach, consisting of a 
standardized search protocol applied 
to 3 separate publication databases 
and performed by 2 investigators 
independently. These searches were 
further augmented with investigator 
queries, making missed publications 
unlikely.
CONCLUSIONS
We have found that pediatric 
clinical trials are frequently 
discontinued or the results are 
not published. Thousands of 
children have participated in these 
trials, representing considerable 
inefficiencies and waste of financial 
and human resources. Although 
policies and initiatives have been 
implemented to increase the number 
of pediatric trials and improve the 
standards of trial reporting overall, 
further action is needed to ensure 
that the participation of all children 
in clinical trials contributes to our 
scientific knowledge.
