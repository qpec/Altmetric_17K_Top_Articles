Summary
Background High resource expenditure on acute care is a challenge for mental health services aiming to focus on 
supporting recovery, and relapse after an acute crisis episode is common. Some evidence supports self-management 
interventions to prevent such relapses, but their effect on readmissions to acute care following a crisis is untested. We 
tested whether a self-management intervention facilitated by peer support workers could reduce rates of readmission to 
acute care for people discharged from crisis resolution teams, which provide intensive home treatment following a crisis.
Methods We did a randomised controlled superiority trial recruiting participants from six crisis resolution teams in 
England. Eligible participants had been on crisis resolution team caseloads for at least a week, and had capacity to give 
informed consent. Participants were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups by an unmasked data 
manager. Those collecting and analysing data were masked to allocation, but participants were not. Participants in the 
intervention group were offered up to ten sessions with a peer support worker who supported them in completing a 
personal recovery workbook, including formulation of personal recovery goals and crisis plans. The control group 
received the personal recovery workbook by post. The primary outcome was readmission to acute care within 1 year. 
This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 01027104.
Findings 221 participants were assigned to the intervention group versus 220 to the control group; primary outcome 
data were obtained for 218 versus 216. 64 (29%) of 218 participants in the intervention versus 83 (38%) of 216 in the 
control group were readmitted to acute care within 1 year (odds ratio 0·66, 95% CI 0·43–0·99; p=0·0438). 71 serious 
adverse events were identified in the trial (29 in the treatment group; 42 in the control group).
Interpretation Our findings suggest that peer-delivered self-management reduces readmission to acute care, although 
admission rates were lower than anticipated and confidence intervals were relatively wide. The complexity of the study 
intervention limits interpretability, but assessment is warranted of whether implementing this intervention in routine 
settings reduces acute care readmission.

Introduction
Users of mental health services tend to be unenthusiastic 
about the prospect and the experience of receiving acute 
care, preferring interventions to help them recover, 
reintegrate with society, and achieve their personal goals.1 
However, a large proportion of the scarce mental health 
resources in the UK and elsewhere are committed to 
inpatient and other acute care.2
In the National Health Service (NHS), crisis resolution 
teams are available nationwide as part of a strategy to 
reduce acute bed use.3,4 Their target group is service 
users who are experiencing a crisis of sufficient severity 
for hospital admission to be considered. Clinicians in 
primary and secondary care refer service users whom 
they believe to meet this criterion, and in some catchment 
areas, self-referrals are also accepted. Guidance regarding 
the model requires that no hospital admission can occur 
without the agreement of crisis resolution teams. Some 
research evaluations have been positive, suggesting that 
crisis resolution teams can reduce inpatient admissions5,6 
and health-care costs,7 and increase service user satis-
faction with acute care.4,7 However, national implemen-
tation of the model has not resulted in a consistent 
reduction in bed use.8
A factor contributing to this failure to reduce 
admissions is a high rate of readmission to acute care,9 
with more than half of users of crisis resolution teams 
readmitted within a year.10 A scoping review11 on 
interventions relevant to mental health crises found no 
robust evidence on how to prevent repeat crises in 
people leaving crisis care. Such evidence is needed in the 
UK and elsewhere to reduce heavy acute service use and 
support service users in making an uninterrupted 
recovery from crises.

Self-management interventions have been developed in 
both mental and physical health care, and support people 
to actively manage their health problems.12 Interventions 
commonly include learning to anticipate and respond 
to signs of a crisis, and developing skills to manage 
symptoms and other difficulties. If successful, such 
interventions could reduce relapses and repeat acute care 
admissions following crises. In long-term conditions, self-
management interventions are reportedly most successful 
when integrated with other care and as part of a service 
philosophy.13 Several modes of delivery can be used or 
combined in self-management inter 
ventions, including 
bibliotherapy or digital interventions, or involvement 
of clinicians in providing education and training.14 
Involvement of peer workers with relevant personal 
experience is another potential mode of delivery. Peer 
workers could provide support and encouragement that is 
particularly warm and empathic because it is rooted in 
personal experience, and they provide service users with 
role models for recovery.15,16 Thus, peer supporters appear 
particularly appropriate providers of interventions to 
promote self-management. North American trials of 
peer-supported self-management programmes such as 
the Wellness Recovery Action Plan17 and the Recovery 
Workbook18 report promising effects on symptoms and 
self-management skills. However, sub 
stantial evidence is 
not available regarding the effective 
ness of these 
approaches, or of self-management inter 
ventions in 
general, in preventing relapse or acute care readmissions 
among people with mental health disorders.19
We tested whether an intervention to promote self-
management in people leaving the care of mental health 
crisis teams reduced their subsequent rates of re-
admission to acute care. Peer support workers are 
increasingly employed in the NHS to support recovery, 
promoted by initiatives such as the NHS Confederation 
Implementing Recovery through Organisational Change 
project,20 but thus far the effectiveness of their efforts in 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In 2013, we did a systematic review and meta-analysis on 
self-management interventions for people with severe mental 
illness. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials, CINAHL, DARE, Embase, Medline, and PsycINFO from 
their inception to June 30, 2013. Search terms for the 
interventions included “self-management”, “self-care”, 
“self-administration”, “self-evaluation”, “self-help”, 
“self-monitoring”, and “self-reinforcement”. We retrieved 
35 papers meeting criteria for the review, of which 33 could be 
used in a meta-analysis. Most papers had very low Grading of 
Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation 
ratings and short follow-up periods. Immediately after 
intervention, self-management programmes were more 
effective than controls for positive and negative symptoms of 
psychosis, psychological health symptoms, quality of life, 
hope, and self-rated and clinician-rated recovery; there were 
no significant differences between groups for service use 
outcomes, functioning, insight, or empowerment. Medium 
term (up to 12 months) pooled follow-up results showed 
effects on symptoms regressed to the mean in the year after 
treatment had ceased; however, quality of life, recovery, and 
hope remained significantly in favour of self-management. 
Studies did not focus on prevention of repeat crises in people 
using acute services. We also did a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of studies of peer-support interventions for 
people with severe mental health problems. 18 trials with 
considerable heterogeneity met criteria for this review, most 
again rated as low quality. There was little or no evidence that 
peer support was associated with positive effects on hospital 
admission, overall symptoms, or satisfaction with services. 
There was some evidence that peer support was associated 
with positive effects on measures of hope, recovery, and 
empowerment at and beyond the end of the intervention, 
although this was not consistent within or across different 
types of peer support. Thus, before our study, there was no 
substantial evidence on whether self-management 
interventions prevent readmission to crisis care services, and 
when we repeated our search in 2017 the same conclusion was 
drawn. Regarding peer support, evidence did not suggest 
effectiveness in reducing relapse or hospital admission among 
people with substantial mental health problems.
Added value of this study
We show an effect on readmission to acute care from a 
self-management intervention delivered by a peer support 
worker. This finding is novel, and of considerable potential 
importance because the intervention is feasible and acceptable, 
and service managers, planners, and users prioritise avoiding 
relapse and readmission to acute care.
Implications of all the available evidence
People discharged from community crisis services are often 
readmitted to acute care. This consumes resources that might 
otherwise be dedicated to longer term improvements in 
functioning and quality of life, prevents crisis services having 
intended effects on acute admissions, and impedes service 
users in pursuing their goals for their own recovery. Our trial 
shows the potential effectiveness of peer-delivered 
self-management in addressing this challenge, warranting 
investigation of the results of its implementation in routine 
settings. Self-management interventions are widely 
advocated and offer a straightforward mechanism for 
empowering service users and improving outcomes, but 
sustained and widespread implementation has not so far 
occurred. Our results also show that offering such an 
intervention during the period after a crisis is likely to be 
feasible and fruitful.

reducing acute care readmission following a crisis has 
not, to our knowledge, been tested.
The primary hypothesis was that service users receiving 
the experimental intervention would be less likely to 
relapse (indicated by readmission to acute care) over 1 year 
than would those in the control group, who received 
treatment as usual enhanced by access to a self-manage-
ment workbook. Secondary hypotheses were that being in 
the experimental rather than the control group would be 
associated with longer time to first readmission to acute 
care and fewer days in acute care over 1 year, and also with 
better self-rated recovery and illness management skills; 
greater satisfaction with services; fewer symptoms; less 
loneliness; and enhanced social networks at 4 month and 
18 month follow-up interviews.
Methods
Study design and participants
The study was a rater-blinded, randomised controlled 
superiority trial done in six crisis resolution teams in 
England. Participants were identified from caseloads of 
crisis resolution teams, all aiming to operate according to 
the standard NHS model. All crisis resolution teams 
were contactable 24 h a day and saw service users mainly 
at home, offering short-term care during the crisis. 
Structured self-management interventions were not 
widely implemented in these teams’ catchment areas.21
Participants were recruited after discharge by the crisis 
resolution teams. Eligible participants had been on the 
caseload for at least a week of one of the participating crisis 
resolution teams because of a crisis (including participants 
treated only by the crisis resolution team during the crisis 
episode and those initially admitted to hospital or a crisis 
house and then discharged with crisis resolution team 
support), had capacity and were willing to give written 
informed consent to participate, and consented to enter 
the trial within a month of discharge from the crisis 
resolution team. We excluded people who presented such 
a high risk to others that the crisis resolution team judged 
it unsafe for peer support workers to meet them even in a 
mental health service setting, those who were discharged 
to addresses outside the catchment area, and those who 
could not understand the intervention when delivered 
in English.
The published protocol gives greater detail of the meth-
ods.22 The trial was approved by the London Camden and 
Islington Research Ethics Committee (ref 12/LO/0988). A 
steering committee and a data moni 
tor 
ing committee 
oversaw the study.
Randomisation and masking
Following baseline assessment, participants were random-
ly assigned with random permuted blocks into treat-
ment and control groups at a ratio of 1:1, stratified by site. 
The treatment group received a peer-supported self-
management intervention, based on a recovery workbook. 
Participants in the control group were sent the recovery 
book by post and received no other study intervention. 
Randomisation was done by either the study data officer 
or trial manager, generated by an online independent 
randomisation service.
Masking participants was not feasible. Participants and 
crisis resolution team staff were told allocation only after 
discharge from the crisis resolution team to ensure that 
allocation did not influence other plans for care. Data on 
readmission to acute care during the follow-up period 
was provided by administrators from participating NHS 
trusts, who were not informed of participants’ treatment 
allocation, and entered in study databases by study 
research staff who were masked to treatment allocation. 
Research staff doing follow-up interviews at 4 months and 
18 months were also not told participants’ allocation and 
asked them not to disclose this at interview. Study 
statisticians analysing data were also masked to the 
allocation.
Procedures
The peer-supported self-management intervention was 
adapted from recovery resources developed by Rachel 
Perkins, Julie Repper, and Miles Rinaldi, and their 
colleagues at South West London and St George’s Mental 
Health NHS Trust.23 Selection and adaptation of the 
intervention is described in a companion paper.24 This 
process included literature searches and expert con-
sultations to identify potential interventions; individual 
interviews with 41 service users exploring relevant views; 
stakeholder focus groups to inform adaptation of the 
intervention to a crisis resolution team context; and an 
uncontrolled feasibility study in which trained peer 
supporters delivered the intervention to 11 consenting 
participants.
Participants in the intervention group were offered ten 
individual sessions of 1 h each with a peer support worker. 
Sessions took place roughly once per week, aiming to 
conclude within 4 months. The peer support worker 
offered supportive listening and sought to instil hope 
through appropriate sharing of skills and coping strategies 
acquired in their own recovery. The inter 
vention was 
structured around completion of a personal recovery 
workbook that included: setting personal recovery goals, 
making plans to re-establish community functioning and 
support networks after a crisis, using the recent crisis 
experience to identify early warning signs and formulate 
an action plan to avoid or attenuate relapse, and planning 
strategies to maintain wellbeing once a crisis had abated.
The workbook included boxes in which participants 
were encouraged to record observations, goals, and plans 
in each of these areas. Peer support workers were strongly 
encouraged to support participants in fully completing the 
workbook, but intervention time was sufficient for them 
also to spend time on more unstructured support and 
reflection on experiences and plans.
Peer support workers all had personal experience 
of using mental health services. Training included

familiarising them with the workbook and how to support 
participants in using it, as well as more general content 
such as listening skills, cultural awareness, self-disclosure, 
and confidentiality. Group supervision was provided by 
clinicians from employing NHS trusts, typically once 
every 2 weeks, with additional support from the study 
team, including from an experienced peer support worker.
Participants in the control group were sent the personal 
recovery workbook by post, and were invited to complete it 
independently if they wished.
Peer support workers kept a brief anonymised log of the 
intervention, including sessions offered and attended and 
sections of the workbook completed. This log was shared 
with supervisors and the research team. Participants 
answered questions about their awareness and use of the 
workbook at interviews at 4 months.
Participants in both groups also received usual care, 
with no treatments withheld. A range of pathways were 
followed; participants were discharged to primary care if 
they did not need continuing specialist mental health care. 
Secondary mental health services in the trusts were 
configured in various ways, usually including community 
mental health teams as the main providers of continuing 
care, early intervention teams for psychosis, and assertive 
outreach teams.
Data were collected at baseline, in follow-up interviews 
at 4 months and 18 months, and from patient records. 
After written consent was provided and before allocation 
to groups, a study researcher collected baseline data from 
all participants in a structured interview. At 4 months and 
18 months, researchers contacted participants to seek 
written informed consent for an interview. If obtained, a 
structured interview was held, including secondary 
outcome questionnaires. Data on acute care use were 
obtained from the data administrator of each trust by a 
blinded researcher.
After adjusting the intervention in response to findings 
from initial feasibility testing, a pilot randomised 
controlled trial was done in one trust (also included in the 
main trial) to test the feasibility and acceptability of trial 
procedures. 40 participants were recruited. It was agreed 
by the trial steering committee and funders that changes 
to study procedures and to the intervention following this 
internal pilot were sufficiently minimal for the internal 
pilot sample to be included within the main study sample. 
Data from the pilot trial were not analysed before 
proceeding to the main trial.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was readmission of participants to 
an acute service (including acute inpatient wards, crisis 
resolution teams, crisis houses, and acute day care 
services) within 1 year after study entry. Secondary 
outcomes over 1 year of follow-up were days on the 
caseload of an acute service and time to first relapse 
(indicated by admission to an acute service). Secondary 
outcome measures assessed at 4 months and 18 months 
were: self-rated recovery, measured by total score on 
the Questionnaire on the Process of Recovery,25 a 22 item 
measure of self-rated recovery; self-management skills, 
rated by score on the patient version of the Illness 
Management and Recovery Scale,26 a 15 item measure of 
self-reported management of illness and functioning; 
client satisfaction, rated by total score on the Client 
Satisfaction Questionnaire,27 an eight item measure of 
respondents’ overall satisfaction with mental health 
services; symptom severity, measured by the Brief 
Psychiatric Rating Scale,28 a 24 item scale of psychiatric 
symptoms rated by researchers on the basis of 
the participant’s responses to a structured interview 
schedule; loneliness, as assessed by the University of 
California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale,29 an 
eight item measure of self-rated loneliness; and social 
network, measured by the Lubben Social Network Scale,30 
a six item measure of social contact with family and 
friends.
Further measures used to characterise the sample and 
to adjust in secondary analysis for variables known to 
be associated with the primary outcome included 
sociodemographic and clinical data (including age, sex, 
ethnicity, accommodation and living situation, employ-
ment status, educational attainment, and past service use, 
including admissions and compulsory admissions) and 
clinical diagnosis as recorded on electronic records using 
the International Classification of Diseases-10. Serious 
adverse events were actively monitored for both groups 
until completion of the 4-month follow-up interview.
Ethical approval was obtained for protocol amendment 
between the pilot and main trials to (a) add an interview 
to measure secondary outcomes 18 months after 
baseline and (b) add the UCLA Loneliness Scale and 
Lubben Social Network Scale to measures.
Statistical analysis
We required a sample size of 440 to detect a difference 
in admission rates during the follow-up period of 
50% in the control group versus 35% in the experimental 
group, with 80% power, 5% significance, and 1:1 allo 
-
cation. This calculation allowed for clustering by peer 
support worker in the intervention arm only, assuming 
an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0·03.
We checked the assumptions underlying tests 
through 
out. We did adjusted analyses if baseline char-
acter 
istics were unbalanced. All analyses included only 
people for whom we had complete data available, using 
the groups to which the patients were randomised. We 
used Stata (version 14) throughout.
We compared readmission during the study period 
between randomisation groups using a logistic regression 
model with fixed effects for randomisation group, 
diagnosis (psychosis vs no psychosis), and NHS trust 
centre, and random intercepts to account for clustering 
by peer support worker. Participants in the control group 
were considered as individual clusters of size one.

For analysis of the secondary outcomes assessed by 
validated scales at 4 months and 18 months, we used 
linear regression with random intercepts (with peer 
support worker as the random effect), controlling for the 
baseline value of the outcome, condition (psychosis vs no 
psychosis), and centre. We had planned to use random 
effects Poisson regression to assess total days spent in 
acute care and a Cox regression frailty model for time to 
first readmission. However, on seeing the structure of 
the data, a zero inflated negative binomial with robust 
standard errors was more appropriate, given that more 
than half of participants had not spent any days in acute 
care since baseline. For time to first admission, the Cox 
regression frailty model did not converge, so we used a 
standard Cox regression with robust standard errors.
Few data were missing for the primary outcome, 
because it was derived from routinely recorded data. We 
quantified the extent of missingness for the other 
outcomes. We also investigated whether there were any 
patterns of missingness by creating dichotomous variables 
for each outcome to indicate whether that outcome was 
missing or not, and then investigating whether there 
were any associations between these variables and base-
line characteristics using logistic regression models 
with random intercepts to account for clustering by 
peer support worker. We controlled for any baseline 
characteristics associated with missingness in sensitivity 
analyses to maintain the assumption of data missing 
at random.
This trial was registered with ISRCTN, number 
01027104.

Results
From 3288 mental health service users screened, 
1848 were eligible and 441 participants were recruited 
(figure). 40 participants were recruited in the internal 
pilot between May 14, 2013, and Nov 12, 2013. The 
remaining 401 were recruited between March 12, 2014, 
and July 3, 2015. The final 18 month interview took place 
on Feb 23, 2017
. 344 (78%) of 441 completed the 4-month 
follow-up interview, and 255 (58%) of 441 completed the 
18-month interview. Most baseline characteristics were 
balanced between groups (table 1). The sample was 
diverse in terms of demographics, diagnosis, and service 
use history.
Readmission to acute care within 1 year was 
significantly lower in the intervention group than in the 
control group: 64 (29%) of 218 participants readmitted 
in intervention group versus 83 (38%) of 216 participants 
in the control group (odds ratio [OR] 0·66, 95% CI 
0·43–0·99; p=0·0438; table 2). This difference persisted 
with planned adjustments (data not shown). Time to re-
admission was significantly longer in the intervention 
than in the control group (table 2). However, the number 
of days in acute care was not significantly different. 
Initial descriptive analyses showed an unexpected 
difference between groups in the number of days 
between randomisation and discharge from the index 
acute care admission (mean 8·6 days [SD 34·4] in the 
intervention group vs mean 2·9 days [SD 9·2] in the

control group). In view of this, we did a post-hoc 
sensitivity analysis excluding these days and including 
only days that were part of acute care readmissions. In 
this analysis, participants in the intervention group had 
fewer days in acute care than did participants in the 
control group, but the difference was not significant 
(median 0 days [IQR 0–10] vs 0 days [IQR 0–22]; mean 
13 days [SD 31] vs 19 days [SD 40]; 154 [71%] of 218 had no 
days in acute care vs 133 [62%] of 216; incident rate ratio 
[IRR] 0·90, 95% CI 0·66–1·23, p=0·5158). There was no 
evidence of a difference between groups in contact with 
the community mental health teams that were the main 
secondary care providers after discharge from a crisis 
resolution team (table 2).
At 4 months of follow-up, overall satisfaction with 
mental health-care received was greater in the 
intervention group than in the control group (table 2). 
There was also a significant difference in self-rated 
recovery favouring the intervention (table 2), but the 
difference was not significant in sensitivity analysis with 
adjustment for predictors of missingness (IRR 2·18, 
 
95% CI –0·72 to 5·08). There were no other significant 
differences at 4 months. At 18 months, there was little 
evidence of any effect; the difference in social networks 
favoured the intervention but it was not statistically 
significant.
Regarding uptake of the intervention, 160 (72%) of 
221 participants in the intervention group were treated 
according to the protocol—ie, they attended at least three 
meetings with their peer support worker, with a median 
of seven meetings (IQR 2–10) attended. 65 (33%) of 
198 participants attended all ten meetings offered. 
Similar numbers of participants in each group reported 
that they had read the workbook at the 4 month interview 
(133 [84%] of 158 participants in the control group vs 
142 [88%] of 162 in the intervention group). However, 
more participants in the intervention group reported 
using it to make written plans. Using the workbook to 
make written plans was reported by between 28% (38 of 
138 participants for the section “Managing your ups and 
downs”) and 44% (61 of 138 participants for the section 
“Moving on after a crisis”) of participants in the control 
group, compared with between 58% (83 of 144 participants 
for the section “Your goals and dreams”) and 64% (92 of 
144 participants for the section “Keeping well”) of the 
intervention group.
Three protocol breaches were reported to the study 
sponsors, trial steering committee, and data monitoring 
committee, resulting in eight experimental group 
participants not being offered the intervention per 
protocol. Two breaches were administrative errors by the 
data officer or peer support worker supervisor, resulting 
in participants not being offered the intervention by 
4 months. One breach occurred when a peer support 
worker left after offering participants fewer than three 
sessions and was not replaced in time to offer the full 
intervention.
71 serious adverse events were identified (29 in the 
treatment group; 42 in the control group), including 
55 readmissions to acute care, 11 attempted suicides,

one participant charged with attempted murder, and 
four deaths (all in the control group: two suicides, two 
with unclear circumstances). All serious adverse events 
were assessed independently by the steering committee 
chair and the participant deaths and attempted murder 
by the data monitoring committee chair. None was 
judged related to the study.
Discussion
The effect we observed for the primary outcome suggests 
that the peer-delivered self-management intervention 
reduces readmissions to acute care after a period of crisis 
team care, confirming the primary hypothesis, although 
the confidence intervals are relatively wide. If the finding 
that repeat periods of acute care were reduced by around 
a quarter is replicated in routine settings, the burden on 
the acute care system could be reduced substantially, 
and service users would have greater opportunities for 
sustained recovery. This trial adds promising evidence 
for self-management interventions for people with 
significant mental health problems: our systematic 
literature search did not find another substantial trial 
showing an effect on re 
admissions to acute care.19 It 
addresses the need for evidence on how to prevent repeat 
crises11 and provides the most robust evidence yet for the 
effectiveness of any peer-provided intervention in a UK 
secondary mental health setting.31 It also adds to evidence 
from US trials that structured, peer-delivered recovery-
focused inter 
ventions including a relapse prevention 
component—such as a Wellness and Recovery Action 
Plan18 or Recovery Workbook17—can improve outcomes 
for mental health service users. A novel finding was 
support for the effectiveness of such an intervention to 
prevent relapse in users of crisis services.
We found that the intervention improved time to first 
acute readmission, but the number of days in acute care 
was not different, although in a post-hoc analysis 
including only days during readmissions to acute care, 
intervention participants were admitted for fewer days. 
However, no firm conclusions can be drawn from this 
analysis because of uncertainty around the treatment 
estimate, which is in part due to the high proportion of 
participants in each arm who were not readmitted.
Following planned adjustment for confounders, there 
was also a modest difference for overall satisfaction with 
care. The rating was of overall satisfaction with all care 
during and after crisis, so the impact of the trial inter-
vention might have been diluted by views of other aspects 
of crisis management. Translating a positive effect on 
service users’ views to routine care could help address 
recurrent findings of dissatisfaction with continuity of 
care and support following crises.32
For other secondary measures, there was a difference in 
perceived recovery at 4 months, but this was no longer 
significant in a sensitivity analysis adjusted for predictors 
of missingness. Effects on other 4 month outcomes, such 
as self-management skills and symptoms favoured the 
intervention, but the differences were not statistically 
significant. These differences had largely disappeared by 
18 months, except for network size. These results were 
less positive than in some previous studies of self-
management in mental health,14,17,18 and did not provide a 
robust basis for explaining the mechanism through 
which the effect on the primary outcome was achieved. 
Aspects of peer support or effects of formulating advance 
plans for crises that were not captured by our secondary 
measures might be relevant. Our secondary outcomes 
were global measures of recovery and illness management 
skills encompassing many aspects of participants’ lives; 
more specific measures of potential mechanisms of 
action, such as confidence in recognising early warning 
signs, might be more informative. Of note, an Australian 
uncontrolled evaluation of peer support following an 
acute inpatient admission reported positive effects.33
With regard to strengths and limitations, the design 
and procedures were robust and followed international 
guidance, with oversight from a registered clinical trials 
unit. However, blinding of study participants was not 
feasible. The primary outcome was measured objectively 
and data obtained for 98% of participants. However, a 
limitation is that we could not clearly differentiate the 
effect on relapse during and following treatment. 
Regarding the primary outcome, readmissions were less 
frequent than anticipated when we powered the study. 
Although we have produced evidence that peer-delivered 
self-management reduces readmission to acute care, the 
confidence interval for the corresponding OR is relatively 
wide.
An acceptable response rate of nearly 80% was also 
achieved for the end-of-treatment secondary outcomes, 
although the response rate of just below 60% at 18 month 
follow-up is a limitation. Uptake of the intervention was 
fairly good, with 72% of the intervention group attending 
at least three meetings, although not all completed the 
workbook. Three meetings were considered by the 
research team and peer support workers to be sufficient to 
discuss and complete the personal recovery workbook, 
although the median of seven sessions attended will have 
allowed for more unstructured discussions with peer 
support workers.
Delivery of the intervention in a randomised trial had 
some effects on how it was implemented. About one in 
seven crisis resolution team service users screened and 
one in four of those eligible took part in the trial. However, 
we do not know how far this reflects the proportion of 
service users who might accept this intervention if offered 
as part of routine care. The intervention was designed to be 
broadly applicable, and an effect was obtained in a clinically 
and socially diverse group, suggesting potential for good 
generalisability. However, some clinical and social groups 
might benefit differently from the intervention.
We were not able to obtain anonymised data to directly 
compare our sample with those not recruited. However, a 
study9 using the Clinical Record Interactive Search tool 
 Articles

417
for anonymising routine data examined an unselected 
sample of crisis resolution team users in two of six of the 
trusts in our study, allowing some simple comparisons. 
48% of all users in one of these trusts and 45% in the 
other were male, compared with 40% in our sample; 68% 
and 50% were white compared with 65% in our sample; 
14% and 20% were married compared with 21% in our 
sample; 24% and 35% had non-affective psychosis 
diagnoses compared with 19% in our sample; 29% and 
37% had affective disorders compared with 36% in our 
sample. Thus, our sample was not highly unrepresentative 
of the crisis resolution team user population, although 
there may have been subtler differences, for example in 
motivation.
Our primary goal in designing the intervention was to 
maximise the likelihood that it would be effective. The 
result was a complex intervention with multiple compo-
nents, including both peer support and self-management 
elements. Therefore, we cannot pinpoint the elements that 
resulted in its effectiveness. The control intervention, 
which involved sending participants the workbook through 
the post, resulted in a higher than anticipated proportion 
reading and making use of this tool. We do not know 
whether this intervention alone might be effective, and 
this active control might have diluted the impact of the 
experimental intervention. Most peer support workers 
were delivering an intervention of this type for the first 
time, and their confidence and familiarity with the 
intervention probably improved in the course of the trial.
This study should be replicated to confirm our findings. 
Better understanding of the critical components and 
mechanisms of effect of the intervention is also needed. 
Such understanding is particularly pertinent as improve-
ments in symptoms and in social support are potential 
mechanisms for reduced rates of relapse, but differences 
on these outcomes were not significant. An evaluation of 
the CORE trial data will explore whether the relationship 
with the peer support worker and completion of the 
recovery plan have independent effects on outcomes, and 
will assess qualitatively experiences of the intervention. In 
addition, the intervention needs investigation from an 
implementation perspective. Research is needed on how to 
embed and sustain peer-supported self-management in 
routine services, and on associated outcomes and staff and 
service user experiences.
Our trial provides support for the wider and more 
systematic roll-out of practices that already attract 
considerable support from service planners and from 
service users themselves. Ideally, this implementation 
should be linked to mixed methods evaluation of the 
results of such roll-out in different contexts.
