Abstract
Complex neuronal circuitries such as those present in the mammalian cerebral cortex have evolved 
as balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Although the establishment of 
appropriate numbers for these cells is essential for brain function and behaviour, our understanding 
of this fundamental process is very fragmentary. Here we show that interneuron cell survival in 
mice depends on the activity of pyramidal cells during a critical window of postnatal development, 
in which excitatory synaptic input to individual interneurons predicts their outcome. Pyramidal 
cells regulate interneuron survival through the negative modulation of PTEN signalling, which 
effectively drives interneuron cell death during this period. Taken together, our findings indicate 
that activity-dependent mechanisms dynamically adjust the number of inhibitory cells in nascent 
local cortical circuits, ultimately establishing the appropriate proportions of excitatory and 
inhibitory neurons in the cerebral cortex.
In the adult neocortex, approximately one in six neurons are inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric 
acid-containing (GABAergic) interneurons1,2, and this ratio is relatively stable across 
cortical regions and species regardless of total neuronal numbers3–6. The cellular balance 
between excitation and inhibition is critical for brain function and is likely disrupted in a 
number of neuropsychiatric conditions7–9. However, the mechanisms regulating the

 establishment of appropriate numbers of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cerebral 
cortex remain largely unknown.
Programmed cell death, also known as apoptosis, is an essential mechanism that sculpts the 
central and peripheral nervous systems during development10–12. The death of developing 
neurons is mediated by an evolutionarily conserved signalling pathway that involves the pro-
apoptotic Bcl2 family members Bax and Bak13. Previous studies have shown that both 
cortical pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons undergo extensive cell death during 
postnatal development14,15, which suggests that apoptosis may contribute to the 
establishment of balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cerebral 
cortex. However, the temporal relationship and interdependency of the programmed cell 
death periods for both populations of neurons have not been explored in detail.
Concatenated waves of neuronal death
To determine the developmental sequence that establishes the final ratio of excitatory and 
inhibitory neurons in the cerebral cortex, we estimated the absolute numbers and relative 
proportions of pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons at different postnatal stages of 
development using stereological methods in mouse strains in which specific classes of 
neurons are irreversibly labelled. We chose this method to estimate programmed cell death 
over the direct quantification of dying cells because classical apoptotic markers such as 
cleaved caspase-3 have non-apoptotic roles in neurons16 and are only expressed very 
transiently (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). We crossed NexCre/+ and Nkx2-1-Cre mice with 
appropriate reporter strains (see Methods) to identify pyramidal cells and GABAergic 
interneurons, respectively. Expression of Cre under the control of the Neurod6 locus in 
NexCre/+ mice labels all cortical excitatory neurons with the exception of Cajal-Retzius 
cells17. Nkx2-1-Cre mice specifically label interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic 
eminence (MGE) and preoptic area (POA), including the two largest groups of cortical 
GABAergic interneurons, Parvalbumin (PV+) and Somatostatin (SST+) expressing cells18.
We observed that the total number of excitatory neurons in the neocortex decreases (~12%) 
between postnatal day (P) 2 and P5, and then remains stable into adulthood (Fig. 1a, b, e). 
The reduction in excitatory neurons affects all layers of the neocortex and not only subplate 
cells (Extended Data Fig. 1c–e), which are known to undergo programmed cell death during 
this period19. By contrast, we found that the number of interneurons is steady until P5, 
drops extensively between P5 and P10 (~30%), and remains constant into adulthood (Fig. 
1c–e). Interneuron cell loss follows the normal maturation sequence of MGE/POA 
interneurons20, with deep layer interneurons adjusting their numbers ahead of superficial 
layer interneurons (Fig. 1f). These results revealed that consecutive waves of programmed 
cell death adjust the final ratio of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the developing 
cerebral cortex.
Interneuron activity predicts cell death
Our results indicated that the adjustment of interneuron numbers is preceded by a wave of 
pyramidal cell death, which suggest that these two processes might be directly linked. Since

 previous work has shown that neuronal activity and apoptosis rates are inversely correlated 
in the developing brain21–23, we hypothesised that pyramidal cells may impact interneuron 
survival by increasing the activity of the cells they connect to. We began testing this idea by 
monitoring the activity of MGE/POA interneurons in the superficial layers of the barrel 
cortex (S1BF) during the period of interneuron cell death. To this end, we generated mice 
expressing the fluorescent reporter tdTomato and the genetically encoded calcium sensor 
GCaMP6s in MGE/POA interneurons (Nkx2-1-Cre;RCLtdT/GCaMP6s)24 and performed 
long-term Ca2+ imaging in the same interneurons from layer 2/3 S1BF of awake, head-
restrained pups (Fig. 2a). To select the most appropriate time for these experiments, we 
estimated interneuron cell death in S1BF during postnatal development and found 
comparable dynamics to the rest of the neocortex (Extended Data Fig. 2). For layer 2/3, we 
observed the most prominent decrease in the number of MGE/POA interneurons between P7 
and P8 (Fig. 2b).
We first established our ability to identify surviving interneurons at both times. As expected, 
we observed that the majority of tdTomato+ interneurons in a region of interest (ROI) were 
present in the same location the following day (Fig. 2c). However, we also observed that a 
fraction of tdTomato+ interneurons disappeared between P7 and P8 (Fig. 2c). Since 
MGE/POA interneurons have ceased migration at the end of the first postnatal week25, these 
observations are consistent with the idea that the cells disappearing between P7 and P8 have 
undergone apoptosis.
We next wondered whether neural activity at P7 in interneurons that die by P8 was different 
from that of cells that lived past P8. Analysis of calcium event rates (events/min) at P7 
indicated that interneurons that died at P8 exhibited significantly fewer calcium events than 
neurons that lived past P8 (Fig. 2d, e). We next analysed whether P7 event rates could 
discriminate between neurons that die at P8 and neurons that live beyond this day. Receiver-
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that event rate at P7 performs significantly 
better than chance in discriminating between these two populations (Fig. 2f). These results 
suggested that interneurons with relatively low levels of activity immediately before the 
period of interneuron cell death have an increased probability to undergo apoptosis26,27.
Pyramidal cells regulate interneuron death
The previous experiments led us to hypothesise that interneurons receiving abundant or 
particularly strong inputs during the period of interneuron cell death would have increased 
chances to survive. Since PV+ and SST+ interneurons receive most of their inputs from local 
pyramidal cells during the first postnatal week28, we reasoned that modifying the activity of 
cortical excitatory neurons during the period of interneuron cell death would influence 
interneuron survival. To test this idea, we transiently modified the activity of pyramidal cells 
using a chemogenetic approach based on Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by 
Designer Drugs (DREADDs) that induce neuronal activation or inhibition29. We injected 
the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of P0 NexCre/+ (pyramidal cell-specific) mice with 
the adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding mutant G protein-coupled receptors that induce 
neuronal activation (hM3Dq) or inhibition (hM4Di) following administration of the 
pharmacologically inert molecule clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (Fig. 3a). We then injected pups

 with CNO twice daily between P5 and P8, and examined the distribution of interneurons at 
P21 (Fig. 3a). We found that increasing the activity of pyramidal cells during the period of 
interneuron cell death prevents this process and leads to a significant increase in the density 
of PV+ and SST+ interneurons at P21 compared to control mice (Fig. 3b–d). This effect was 
not due to activity-dependent changes in the expression of PV or SST or in the density of 
pyramidal cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). We also found that dampening the activity of 
pyramidal cells decreases the density of PV+ and SST+ interneurons at P21 compared to 
controls, which indicates that interneuron cell death can be bi-directionally modulated by 
modifying the activity of pyramidal cells (Fig. 3b–d). In both types of experiments, changes 
in the density of interneurons were homogenously distributed across layers containing PV+ 
and SST+ interneurons (Extended Data Fig. 3c, d). CNO administration did not cause a 
redistribution of interneurons from neocortical areas adjacent to the injection site (Extended 
Data Fig. 3e, f). Instead, we observed a prominent increase in the density of cleaved 
caspase-3 cells following inhibition of the activity of pyramidal cells during the normal 
period of interneuron cell death (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c). Importantly, control experiments 
revealed that CNO did not modify the density of PV or SST interneurons in pups not 
infected with AAV-expressing DREADDs (Extended Data Fig. 4d, e). Similarly, CNO 
administration between P10 and P13 in hM3Dq- and hM4Di-injected mice revealed no 
significant changes in the density of PV+ and SST+ interneurons at P21 (Extended Data Fig. 
5). Altogether, these experiments demonstrated that pyramidal cells activity is an essential 
regulator of interneuron survival during the normal period of interneuron cell death.
Interneurons match pyramidal cell numbers
The previous experiments suggest that pyramidal cells ‘rescue’ appropriate numbers of 
cortical interneurons from programmed cell death through an activity-dependent mechanism. 
Based on this idea, we reasoned that modifying the number of pyramidal cells prior to the 
period of interneuron cell death should also influence the number of surviving interneurons. 
To test this hypothesis, we generated conditional mice in which pyramidal cells specifically 
lack Bak and Bax, whose combined function is critical for apoptosis30. As expected, we 
observed that the number of excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex of 
NexCre/+;Bak-/-;Baxfl/fl mutant mice does not decline between P2 and P21 (Extended Data 
Fig. 6). Consequently, NexCre/+;Bak-/-;Baxfl/fl mutant mice have approximately 12% more 
pyramidal cells than control animals (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 6).
We next quantified PV+ and SST+ interneurons in S1 of control and NexCre/+;Bak-/-;Baxfl/fl 
mutant mice at P21. We found that the density of both PV+ and SST+ interneurons increases 
by roughly 30% in NexCre/+;Bak-/-;Baxfl/fl mutant mice compared to controls (Fig. 4a, c), 
which suggests that interneuron cell death is suppressed when pyramidal cell death is 
prevented. This increase is homogenously distributed across layers containing PV+ and SST
+ interneurons (Extended Data Fig. 7a), and was also observed in other neocortical areas 
(Extended Data Fig. 7c, d). To evaluate whether the increase in the number of PV+ and SST
+ interneurons represents the entire population of cells that should have normally died 
through programmed cell death, we generated conditional mice lacking Bax and Bak in 
MGE/POA interneurons. We found that the density of PV+ and SST+ interneurons also 
increases by approximately 30% in Nkx2-1-Cre;Bak-/-;Baxfl/fl mutant mice compared to 
Wong et al.

 controls (Fig. 4b, c). Indeed, fold changes for PV+ and SST+ interneurons were identical for 
NexCre/+;Bak-/-;Baxfl/fl and Nkx2-1-Cre;Bak-/-;Baxfl/fl mutant mice (Extended Data Fig. 7b). 
These results revealed that preventing pyramidal cell death is sufficient to abolish 
programmed cell death in MGE/POA interneurons, which reinforces the idea that excitatory 
input from pyramidal cells onto interneurons during early postnatal development is critical 
for establishing the appropriate ratio of excitatory and inhibitory cells in the cerebral cortex.
PTEN regulates interneuron cell death
We next investigated the molecular mechanisms through which pyramidal cell activity 
prevents programmed cell death in cortical interneurons. In the developing nervous system, 
the serine-threonine kinase Akt is a critical mediator of neuronal survival31,32 that is 
antagonised by the activity of the phosphatase and tensin homolog PTEN33,34. Consistent 
with this notion, we observed that the relative levels of activated Akt (P-Akt/Akt ratio) 
transiently increase in the neocortex during the period of interneuron cell death (Fig. 5a). 
Interestingly, PTEN levels are very heterogeneous among MGE/POA interneurons during 
the same period (Fig. 5b). PTEN levels are transiently elevated in sparse interneurons in 
deep and superficial layers of S1 and this increase is concurrent with the peak of interneuron 
cell death in these layers (Fig. 5c, d and Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). These observations led us 
to hypothesise that high PTEN levels during this period may drive interneurons towards cell 
death, and that pyramidal cells might influence this process by regulating PTEN in 
interneurons.
To test this hypothesis, we generated mice in which we conditionally deleted Pten from 
postmitotic MGE interneurons35,36. We observed that Lhx6-Cre;Ptenfl/fl mutant mice have 
abnormally large jaws and reduced body weight compared to their littermates by P16, 
probably due to the embryonic expression of Lhx6 in the first branchial arch37, which 
prevented their analysis at later developmental stages. We nevertheless found that Pten 
conditional mutants have a significant increase in the density of PV and SST interneurons in 
S1 compared to control mice (Fig. 5e, f, g and Extended Data Fig. 8c, d), without changing 
their relative distribution across layers (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Since Lhx6-Cre drives 
recombination in endothelial cells in addition to MGE interneurons35, we examined whether 
a change in the organisation of neocortical blood vessels might contribute to increased 
survival of interneurons in conditional Pten mutants. We found that the density of blood 
vessels increases in conditional Pten mutants compared to controls (Extended Data Fig. 8c, 
d). However, this change does not affect the density of pyramidal cells (Extended Data Fig. 
8c, d), which rules out an indirect effect of blood vessels on interneuron survival through an 
increase in pyramidal cell density. To discard a direct effect of blood vessels on interneuron 
survival, we carried out a second series of experiments using acute pharmacological 
inhibition of PTEN. We injected the PTEN inhibitor bpV(pic) systemically at P7 and P8 in 
wild type mice and analysed blood vessel density in S1 at P10 (Extended Data Fig. 9b, c). 
Mice injected with the PTEN inhibitor did not exhibit increased blood vessel coverage 
(Extended Data Fig. 9b, c). In contrast, transient PTEN inhibition during the period of 
interneuron cell death increased the density of MGE interneurons compared to control mice 
(Extended Data Fig. 9a, d, e). Mice injected with the PTEN inhibitor outside the normal 
window of interneuron programmed cell death showed similar densities of PV and SST

 interneurons than controls (Extended Data Fig. 9f–h). These results revealed that PTEN is 
most likely required cell-autonomously for interneuron apoptosis during the normal period 
of interneuron cell death.
Finally, we examined whether pyramidal cell activity influences the survival of interneurons 
by non-cell autonomously regulating the expression of PTEN levels in these cells during the 
period of interneuron cell death. To this end, we carried out DREADDs experiments similar 
to those that led to an increased number of cortical interneurons following transient 
activation of pyramidal cells between P5 and P8 (Fig. 3), but here we analysed PTEN levels 
in cortical interneurons at P8 (Fig. 5h). We found that PTEN levels are significantly 
decreased in GABAergic interneurons following the activation of pyramidal cells (Fig. 5i, j). 
These results strongly suggested that pyramidal cells influence the normal process of 
interneuron programmed cell death through the activity-dependent inhibition of PTEN, 
which tips the balance between survival and apoptotic signalling pathways in developing 
interneurons.
Discussion
Our results suggest that interneuron programmed cell death has evolved as a mechanism 
responsible for adjusting the final ratio of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cerebral 
cortex, a critical milestone in the assembly of cortical circuits38. Although synaptic 
mechanisms are known to stabilise excitatory-inhibitory ratios in cortical circuits39–41, this 
effectively requires that the relative proportions of pyramidal cells and interneurons are 
within certain parameters42–44. Considering the disproportionate expansion of neocortical 
areas during human evolution45,46, it is tempting to speculate that the dependency of 
interneuron survival on pyramidal cells provides an evolutionary advantage for the 
preservation of appropriate ratios of excitatory and inhibitory cells during the rapid increase 
of pyramidal cell numbers in the primate lineage.
Our work indicates that interneuron cell death is non-cell autonomously regulated by 
pyramidal cells, which seem to be able to ‘rescue’ connected interneurons from their 
intrinsically determined cell death14 by inhibiting the activity of PTEN during a critical 
window in postnatal development. It is worth noting that a sizable proportion of individuals 
with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and macrocephaly carry deleterious mutations in the 
PTEN gene47,48. Our observations indicate that loss of PTEN function is sufficient to 
disrupt interneuron programmed cell death, which may in turn alter the cellular balance of 
excitation and inhibition in the cerebral cortex. This mechanism may contribute to 
deregulation of cortical information processing and social dysfunction in ASD patients 
carrying PTEN mutations.
The apoptosis rate of pyramidal cells varies among functionally different neocortical areas 
and even across layers within the same cortical area49. This suggests that the proposed 
mechanism may sculpt the heterogeneous patterns of interneuron distributions that exist 
across the cerebral cortex50. Consequently, the regulation of interneuron programmed cell 
death by pyramidal cells likely contributes to the cytoarchitectonical specialisation of 
cortical areas.

 Methods
Animals
All experiments were performed following the guidelines of King’s College London 
Biological Service Unit and in accordance with the European Community Council Directive 
of November 24, 1986 (86/609/EEC). Animal work was carried out under licence from the 
UK Home Office in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Both 
male and female mice were used indiscriminately throughout the study. For stereology on 
pyramidal cells, NexCre/+ mice19 (kindly provided by K.A. Nave) were crossed with Fucci2 
mice51 (RCLFucci2aR/+, kindly provided by R.L. Mort). For stereology on MGE/POA 
interneurons, Nkx2-1-Cre mice20 (JAX008661) were crossed with RCLtdTomato/tdTomato 
mice28 (JAX 007909). For in vivo calcium imaging experiments, Nkx2-1-
Cre;RCLtdTomato/tdTomato mice were crossed with RCLGCaMP6s/+ mice29 (JAX024106) to 
generate Nkx2-1-Cre;RCLtdTomato/GCaMP6s mice. All designer receptor exclusively activated 
by designer drugs (DREADDs) experiments were conducted in mice obtained from crossing 
NexCre/Cre with CD1 mice. To prevent pyramidal cells from undergoing programmed cell 
death, Bak-/-;BaxFl/Fl mice33 (JAX006329) were crossed with NexCre/Cre mice and the F1 
inter-crossed to obtain Bak+/+;BaxFl/Fl and NexCre/+;Bak-/-;BaxFl/Fl mutants. For MGE 
interneurons, a similar breeding scheme used Nkx2-1-Cre mice instead. For the 
quantification of pyramidal cells in NexCre/+;Bak-/-;BaxFl/Fl, these mutants were crossed 
with Fucci2 mice to obtain NexCre/+;Bak-/-;BaxFl/Fl;RCLFucci2aR/+ mutants. PtenFl/+ mice40 
(JAX006440) were crossed with Lhx6-Cre mice39 (kindly provided by N. Kessaris) to 
generate Lhx6-Cre;PtenFl/+, and F1 inter-crosses led to the production of Lhx6-Cre;PtenFl/Fl 
mutant mice. Mice were obtained from Jackson’s laboratories unless otherwise stated.
Histology
Mice were anaesthetised with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially 
perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains from pups younger 
than P6 were post-fixed for 4 h while brains from mice older than P6 were post-fixed for 2 h 
at 4°C. Brains were sectioned either on the sliding microtome at 30 or 40 µm as previously 
described52 or on a vibratome at 40 or 60 µm. All primary and secondary antibodies were 
diluted in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA. The following antibodies were 
used: goat anti-CTGF (1:200, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti cleaved-caspase-3 (1:200, Cell 
Signalling), rabbit anti-dsRed (1:500, Clontech), goat anti-mCherry (1:500, Antibodies-
online), rabbit anti-GABA (1:2000, Millipore), mouse anti-GABA (1:500, Sigma), mouse 
anti-NeuN (1:500, Millipore) mouse anti-parvalbumin (1:1000, Swant), rabbit anti-
parvalbumin (1:5000, Swant), rat anti-somatostatin (1:300, Millipore) and rabbit anti-PTEN 
(1:500, Abcam). We used Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). For 
biotin amplification, sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200, 
Vector labs), followed by Alexa Fluor-conjugated Streptavidin (1:200, Vector labs). Blood 
vessels were stained with Isolectin-B4-FITC or Isolectin-B4-Dylight 594 (1:500, Vector 
labs).

 Stereology
The total number of pyramidal neurons and MGE interneurons in the cerebral cortex were 
estimated using the optical dissector method53,
N = ∑Q− . t
h . asf . ssf
where ΣQ- is the total number of cells counted, t the mean section thickness, h the height of 
the optical dissector (17 µm for pyramidal neuron stereology, 18 µm for MGE stereology), 
adjusting for the guard zones (1 µm) above and below the dissector, asf stands for the area 
sampling fraction and ssf stands for the section sampling fraction (frequency of sampling). 
An ApoTome (Zeiss) equipped with a motorised stage and colour camera was connected to a 
computer with the Stereo Investigator software (MBF Biosciences). The boundaries of the 
neocortex were first defined with a 2.5x objective (Zeiss).
For pyramidal neurons, sampling was performed with a 63x objective (Zeiss, numerical 
aperture (NA) 1.4). The counting frame was set at 15 x 15 µm2 and the grid size at 400 x 400 
µm2. The sampling parameters were as follows: asf = 0.0014, ssf = 0.25 (P2); 0.125 (all 
other ages). For MGE interneurons, sampling was performed with a 40x objective (Zeiss, 
NA 1.3). For the entire cortex stereology analysis, the counting frame was set at 125 x 125 
µm2 and the grid size at 900 x 900 µm2 (P2), 1200 x 1200 µm2 (all other ages). The 
sampling parameters were as follows: asf = 0.019 (P2); 0.011 (all other ages), ssf = 0.125. 
For the upper/lower cortical layer stereology analysis, the counting frame was set at 125 x 
125 µm2 and the grid size at 900 x 900 µm2. The sampling parameters were as follows: asf = 
0.019, ssf = 0.125. For the stereological analysis of the barrel field, the counting frame was 
set at 200 x 200 µm2 and the grid size at 350 x 350 µm2. The sampling parameters were as 
follows: asf = 0.3265, ssf = 0.125.
In vivo imaging
P6 animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and held in a nose-clamp. Isoflurane 
concentration during surgery was maintained between 1-2% and the body temperature was 
maintained at 37°C by a heating pad. The scalp was cleaned with Betadine and cut open to 
expose the skull covering the dorsal neocortex. The periosteal tissue, surrounding the skull, 
was gently scraped with a scalpel. The skull was cleaned with Betadine and Ringer’s 
solution. A circular custom-made metal head-post (Luigs and Neumann) was attached over 
the left-hemisphere with cyanoacrylate glue (Henkel). A thin protective layer of glue was 
applied over the skull. The glue was allowed to dry for 10 minutes. Dental cement (Paladur) 
was used to reinforce the attachment of the head-post to the skull. The animal was injected 
with Buprenorphine (2 µl/g of a 50 μg/ml solution) and returned to its home cage.
At P7, the animal was anesthetized and head-restrained in a custom-made head holder. A 3-
mm craniotomy was opened over the posterior-lateral neocortex. This craniotomy 
encompassed the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Care was taken not to damage the dura 
mater. A circular coverslip (3 mm diameter, Harvard Apparatus) was placed over the 
craniotomy and its edges were sealed with cyano-acrylate glue and reinforced with dental

 cement. Following surgery, Dexamethasone (5 µl/g of a 38 μg/ml solution) was injected 
subcutaneously. The animal was allowed to recover for at least 2 hours in its home cage, 
following which we commenced imaging at P7.
Imaging sessions lasted for 40-60 min and we imaged the same field of view for consecutive 
days in 3 mice. TdTomato and GCaMP6s54 were excited using a Ti-Sapphire laser 
(Coherent Chameleon) tuned to λ = 930 nm. The emitted photons were collected by two 
GaAsP detectors through a 20x objective (Olympus, 1.0 NA). The field of view (FOV) 
measured 385 x 385 μm (512 x 512 pixels). The scan speed was set to 30 Hz and image 
sequences were obtained in sweeps of 1 minute (1800 images/channel/minute). The average 
excitation power was between 40 and 50 mW, and this was kept constant over all imaging 
days.
To correct for motion artefacts, image registration was carried out using custom written 
spatial cross-correlation methods on the tdTomato channel. Briefly, on every 1 min sweep, a 
part of the tdTomato image sequence, where the animal was not moving, was chosen and 20 
frames were averaged to give a non-moving reference image. Every frame of the tdTomato 
image sequence was spatially cross-correlated to this reference image and offset along the 
X- and Y-axes to match the cross-correlation peak. The offsets obtained for each tdTomato 
frame was applied to the corresponding GCaMP6s frame.
Calcium imaging analysis
Circular ROIs (diameter = 20 pixels) were manually drawn around tdTomato expressing cell 
bodies. The mean GCaMP6s fluorescence intensity in time was extracted. Changes in 
fluorescence signal were calculated as ΔF/F0, where the baseline fluorescence (F0) is the 
mode of a kernel density estimate of F (ksdensity function in Matlab). Calcium events were 
detected by setting a threshold of 3% change in fluorescence from baseline.
Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves
To identify whether the calcium event rate (events/min) at P7 could act as a binary classifier 
in distinguishing cells that will live and cells that die at P8, we plotted the ROC curve55 by 
varying the discrimination threshold (which, in this case, is the P7 event rate) and calculated 
the area under the curve (AUC). To test for statistical significance, the cell labels were 
randomly shuffled 5000 times. On each shuffle, we calculated the ROC curve and the 
corresponding AUC. We then compared our observed AUC to the distribution of shuffled 
AUCs. The p-value is the fraction of shuffled AUCs ≥ observed AUC.
Intracranial injections
pAAV8-hSyn-DiO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry and pAAV8-hSyn-DiO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry were 
gifts from Bryan Roth (Addgene plasmids #44361 and #44362)56. P0 mice were 
anesthetized with isoflurane and were mounted in a stereotaxic frame. Pups were injected 
with 600 nl of virus diluted in PBS and coloured with 0.5% Fast Green (Sigma). Injections 
were targeted for the somatosensory cortex with an injection rate of 10nl/s.

 Drugs
For DREADDs experiments, Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO, Tocris) was dissolved in 5% 
dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) and then diluted with 0.9% saline to either 1 mg/ml or 5 mg/ml. 
Pups were injected with vehicle (0.05% DMSO) or CNO (1g/10ml) subcutaneously for 4 
days, twice daily. For the PTEN inhibitor experiments, dipotassium bisperoxovanadium(pic) 
dehydrate (bpV(pic), Sigma) was dissolved in 0.9% saline to 0.2 mg/ml. Pups were injected 
with vehicle (0.9% saline) or bpV(pic) (1g/10ml) intraperitoneally for 2 days, twice daily. 
All treatments for CNO and PTEN inhibitor experiments were randomly assigned.
Western blotting
Mouse somatosensory cortex tissue was homogenised in RIPA lysis buffer containing 50 
mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% 
NP-40 and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete™ Sigma). Samples were denatured in 
Laemmli Sample Buffer57 and run on 10% SDS–PAGE gels. Separated proteins were 
electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% 
BSA in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween20) for 1 h and 
probed with rabbit anti-P-Akt (Ser473, Cell Signalling, 1:1000) overnight at 4°C, followed 
by an HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher, 1:10,000). The blots 
were developed using ECL femto Western blotting detection reagents and following read-
out, they were stripped (Thermo Fisher). After confirming stripping efficiency, an HRP-
conjugated mouse anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signalling, 1:1000) was added overnight at 4°C. 
The blots were developed using ECL western blotting detection reagents the signals were 
registered and following stripping, an HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-Actin (Sigma, 1:20,000) 
was added for 1 h at room temperature. Pico ECL Western blotting reagent was used to 
detect Actin levels. Signals were read on a Li-COR Odyssey Imaging Band intensities were 
analysed using ImageStudioLite.
Image acquisition
Images used for analysis were obtained from an ApoTome (Zeiss), epifluorescence 
microscope (Leica), or SP8 confocal microscope (Leica). ApoTome images were taken 
using the ApoTome function on the Zen2 software. Images obtained with the confocal and 
epifluorescence microscope were taken using the LAS AF software.
Cell counting
Cortical layers were identified based on their distinct histological characteristics. Layer 1 
was identified as a sparsely populated cell layer. The border between layers 2/3 and 4 was 
distinguished by the higher nuclei density of layer 4. Layer 5 was identified as the layer 
basal to layer 4 and above layer 6, which contains less densely packed nuclei. Cell density, 
within cortical layers, was quantified either manually or using custom routines written in 
Matlab (MathWorks). For manual quantification, all analyses were conducted blind and cells 
were counted in a rectangular area, 551.5 µm wide at the pia surface within the 
somatosensory cortex, auditory cortex or motor cortex. Cells were counted without using 
pseudocolour in Fiji. Automatic quantification was carried out by image segmentation using 
morphological operations.

 To identify PTEN staining intensity in tdTomato+ or GABA+ interneurons, self-designed 
Cell Profiler58 pipelines were used. Briefly, tdTomato+ or GABA+ interneurons were 
identified as primary objects using the global Otsu thresholding method and any objects 
outside the pre-set diameter range (25-100 pixels) were excluded. PTEN intensity was 
measured under this cell mask.
Blood vessel analysis
The fraction of the total area covered by blood vessels and the average vessel diameter were 
quantified using “Vessel Analysis”, an ImageJ plugin (http://imagej.net/Vessel_Analysis; 
Govindaraju and Elfarnawany).
Statistical analyses
Unless specified, results were plotted and tested for statistical significance using Prism 7. 
The samples were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Unpaired 
comparisons were analysed using 2-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (normally distributed) 
and Mann-Whitney test (not normally distributed). Multiple comparisons with single 
variable were analysed using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test (comparing the 
mean of each column with the mean of every other column) or Dunnett’s test (comparing the 
mean of each column with the mean of a control column) for normally distributed samples. 
For samples with nonparametric distribution, either Kruskal-Wallis (single measures) or 
Friedman’s test (repeated measures) was performed followed by the post hoc Dunn’s test. 
For multiple comparisons with more than one variable, a two-way ANOVA with post hoc 
Sidak’s test was used. The cumulative distributions of PTEN intensity levels were compared 
using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Analysis of calcium events rate was carried out in 
Matlab. In box plots, the central mark indicates the median, and the bottom and top edges of 
the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. The whiskers extend to the most 
extreme data points not considered outliers. Sample sizes were calculated based on similar 
studies in the literature. All experiments were replicated at least in two different litters.
