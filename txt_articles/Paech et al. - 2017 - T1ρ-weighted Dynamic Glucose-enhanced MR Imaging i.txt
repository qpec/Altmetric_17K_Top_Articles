Purpose:
To evaluate the ability to detect intracerebral regions of 
increased glucose concentration at T1r-weighted dynamic 
glucose-enhanced (DGE) magnetic resonance (MR) imag-
ing at 7.0 T.
Materials and 
Methods:
This prospective study was approved by the institutional 
review board. Nine patients with newly diagnosed glio-
blastoma and four healthy volunteers were included in this 
study from October 2015 to July 2016. Adiabatically pre-
pared chemical exchange–sensitive spin-lock imaging was 
performed with a 7.0-T whole-body unit with a temporal 
resolution of approximately 7 seconds, yielding the time-
resolved DGE contrast. T1r-weighted DGE MR imaging 
was performed with injection of 100 mL of 20% d-glucose 
via the cubital vein. Glucose enhancement, given by the 
relative signal intensity change at T1r-weighted MR imag-
ing (DGEr), was quantitatively investigated in brain gray 
matter versus white matter of healthy volunteers and in 
tumor tissue versus normal-appearing white matter of pa-
tients with glioblastoma. The median signal intensities of 
the assessed brain regions were compared by using the 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Results:
In healthy volunteers, the median signal intensity in basal 
ganglia gray matter (DGEr = 4.59%) was significantly in-
creased compared with that in white matter tissue (DGEr 
= 0.65%) (P = .028). In patients, the median signal inten-
sity in the glucose-enhanced tumor region as displayed on 
T1r-weighted DGE images (DGEr = 2.02%) was signifi-
cantly higher than that in contralateral normal-appearing 
white matter (DGEr = 0.08%) (P , .0001).
Conclusion:
T1r-weighted DGE MR imaging in healthy volunteers and 
patients with newly diagnosed, untreated glioblastoma en-
abled visualization of brain glucose physiology and patho-
physiologically increased glucose uptake and may have the 
potential to provide information about glucose metabo-
lism in tumor tissue.

included in the study (Table). Healthy 
volunteers were included if they did 
not have diabetes (self-reported), 
if they were aged 18 years or older, 
and if they were eligible for 7.0-T MR 
imaging. Eleven patients with MR im-
ages possibly indicating glioblastoma 
were enrolled before undergoing any 
therapy (Table). These patients were 
included if they did not have diabetes 
(self-reported and hemoglobin A1c level 
,6.5%), if they were aged 18 years 
or older, and if they were eligible for 
7.0-T MR imaging. All diagnoses were 
histopathologically confirmed after MR 
imaging by means of surgical resection 
or stereotactic biopsy. Atypical me-
ningioma was subsequently diagnosed 
in one patient, who was consequently 
excluded from this study. Another 
patient was excluded from statistical 
analysis owing to extensive patient 
motion during MR imaging. Baseline 
characteristics of the nine patients 
included in this study (six men, three 
women; median age, 56 years) are de-
scribed in the Table.
by Schuenke et al using CESL DGE MR 
imaging based on T1r mapping (15) 
and T1r-weighted imaging (16). CESL 
approaches are known to be more ro-
bust against B0 field inhomogeneities 
and to yield a stronger glucose weight-
ing compared with CEST approaches 
(10,17). Moreover, it was shown that 
typical artifacts of CESL images in-
duced by B1 field inhomogeneities 
could be eliminated by employing adia-
batic preparation pulses. This allowed 
for the first application of the gluco-
CESL approach with human whole-
body units at 7.0 T (15).
We hypothesized that T1r-weight-
ed DGE MR imaging could enable the 
detection of brain glucose physiology 
in gray matter structures and patho-
physiologically increased glucose up-
take in tumor tissue. Therefore, the 
purpose of this study was to perform 
T1r-weighted DGE MR imaging at 7.0 
T in healthy volunteers and patients 
with newly diagnosed, untreated glio-
blastoma to evaluate the potential 
to detect intracerebral regions of in-
creased glucose concentration during 
intravenous glucose injection.

Advance in Knowledge
 
n T1r-weighted dynamic glucose-
enhanced (DGE) MR imaging at 
7.0 T enables imaging of physio-
logic glucose uptake and may 
have the potential to provide in-
formation about glucose metabo-
lism in the human brain.
Implications for Patient Care
 
n T1r-weighted DGE MR imaging 
may permit noninvasive assess-
ment of brain glucose uptake 
and, potentially, glucose metabo-
lism without dependency on 
radioisotopes.
 
n T1r-weighted DGE MR imaging 
may provide information about 
region-specific glucose uptake in 
tumors, with implications for 
clinical diagnosis and 
management.
G
lucose metabolism provides the 
energy for physiologic brain func-
tion, and altered glucose supply 
is associated with several diseases. 
Increased glucose consumption is a 
hallmark of cancer cells (1). During 
the past 3 decades, positron emission 
tomography (PET) with fluorine 18 
(18F) fluorodeoxyglucose has proven its 
utility as an important clinical tool for 
diagnosis, staging, and therapy moni-
toring of multiple cancer types through 
the visualization of increased tissue 
glucose uptake and metabolism (2,3). 
Glioblastomas, the most frequent and 
malignant intra-axial brain tumors in 
adults, are routinely assessed with gad-
olinium-enhanced magnetic resonance 
(MR) imaging (4). However, 14%–45% 
of malignant gliomas do not enhance 
(5), and conventional MR sequences 
do not provide information about tu-
mor nutrient uptake and metabolism. 
Consequently, the development of non-
invasive glucose imaging techniques is 
of central importance in the assess-
ment of both normal metabolism and 
pathologically altered glucose uptake, 
particularly in neoplasms.
The use of natural, unlabeled d-
glucose as a biodegradable contrast 
agent to image glucose uptake and, 
potentially, glucose metabolism in vivo 
has recently been demonstrated in an-
imal tumor models. Promising results 
have been reported with approaches 
that apply chemical exchange satura-
tion transfer (CEST) (eg, CEST, glu-
coCEST) (6–9) and chemical exchange 
sensitive spin lock (CESL) (eg, CESL, 
glucoCESL) (10–13). A first demon-
stration of the feasibility of dynamic 
glucose-enhanced (DGE) MR imag-
ing in the human brain at 7.0 T was 
recently reported by Xu et al using 
CEST-based DGE MR imaging (14) and

T1r-weighted DGE MR Imaging at 7.0 T
For T1r-weighted DGE MR imaging, 
we used an adiabatically prepared spin-
lock preparation combined with a cen-
tric-reordered single-shot gradient-echo 
sequence (matrix, 128 3 104 3 3; reso-
lution, 1.7 3 1.7 3 5 mm3; 23/3.61; flip 
angle, 10°; section thickness, 5 mm) 
as previously described (15). Data ac-
quisition was performed with the T1r-
weighted DGE MR imaging approach 
recently reported by Schuenke et al 
(16). This technique yields an equiva-
lent sensitivity but essentially increased 
temporal resolution (approximately 7 
seconds resulting from a spin-lock prep-
aration time of 66 msec, an MR imag-
ing readout time of approximately 2.5 
seconds, and a recovery time of 4 sec-
onds) compared with DGE MR imaging 
based on T1r mapping (approximately 
1 minute) (15,16). The frequency of the 
spin-lock pulse was adjusted manually 
for each patient, aiming for a mean ra-
diofrequency field amplitude of B1 = 5 
µT in the tumor region. B1 and simulta-
neous B0 maps were obtained by using 
the simultaneous mapping of water shift 
and B1, or WASABI, approach (19). A 
MR imaging. Dynamic susceptibility 
contrast-enhanced MR images were not 
available in patients 1 and 3 due to time 
constraints in daily clinical practice. Dy-
namic susceptibility contrast-enhanced 
MR imaging was performed after gado-
linium prebolus injection with use of a 
T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo-pla-
nar sequence (matrix, 128 3 128; reso-
lution, 1.8 3 1.8 3 5 mm3; 2200/36; flip 
angle, 90°; number of sections, 26). In 
total, 50–75 dynamic acquisitions were 
performed, including eight to 10 pre-
bolus measurements. A standard dose 
(0.1 mmol per kilogram body weight) of 
gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem; Guer-
bet, Villapinte, France) was adminis-
tered by means of intravenous bolus in-
jection by using a pneumatically driven 
injection pump. Relative cerebral blood 
flow (rCBF) and relative cerebral blood 
volume (rCBV) maps were generated 
by using proprietary Siemens Syngo 
Software (Leonardo, Siemens Health-
care). Image data were coregistered 
with an in-house–developed version of 
the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit 
software employing an automatic multi-
modal rigid registration algorithm (18).
MR Imaging
T1r-weighted DGE imaging and high-
spatial-resolution T1- and T2-weighted 
imaging were performed with a 7.0-T 
whole-body MR unit (Magnetom 7T; 
Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Ger-
many) by using a transmit-and-receive 
(transmit: one channel, receive: 24 
channels) head coil (Nova Medical, 
Wilmington, Mass). The T2-weighted 
sequence (matrix, 512 3 400; resolu-
tion, 0.4 3 0.4 3 2 mm3; repetition 
time msec/echo time msec, 12 
340/54; 
number of sections, 32) was applied 
to all subjects. A T1-weighted magne-
tization-prepared rapid gradient-echo 
(MPRAGE) sequence with 1-mm iso-
tropic resolution was performed at 
7.0 T in all healthy volunteers (matrix, 
256 3 256; resolution, 1.0 3 1.0 3 
1.0 mm3; 1770/3.57). Gadolinium-en-
hanced T1-weighted imaging (matrix, 
320 3 320; resolution, 0.78 3 0.78 3 
1 mm3; 1770/3.57) and dynamic sus-
ceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion 
imaging were performed along with the 
clinical standard MR imaging protocol 
at 3.0 T in patients with glioblastoma

Paech et al
spin-lock time of 50 msec was chosen 
to ensure a high contrast-to-noise ratio 
on the T1r-weighted DGE images. On 
average, 180 individual T1r-weighted 
images were acquired at intervals of 
approximately 7 seconds (6–8 seconds, 
20 seconds for patient 1), leading to an 
average acquisition time for DGE MR 
imaging of approximately 20 minutes, 
including the time for the necessary 
baseline measurements.
Glucose Injection and Blood Sugar Level 
Measurements
All subjects were asked to fast for a 
period of 6–8 hours before undergoing 
MR imaging. Placement and testing of 
the intravenous line was performed be-
fore MR measurements. The patients 
received a manual injection of 100 mL 
of 20% d-glucose, aiming for a total 
injection time of 2 minutes. Because 
the performing physician used differ-
ent sizes of over-the-needle catheters 
(adapted to the condition and size of 
the patient’s vein), the actual injec-
tion time varied between 1 minute 30 
seconds and 3 minutes. Blood glucose 
levels were measured before and ap-
proximately 20 minutes after the injec-
tion of glucose (Table). Possible adverse 
effects due to glucose injections were 
assessed by the performing physician 
during and after DGE MR imaging.
Data Analysis
All data analyses, including statistical 
analysis, were performed with MAT-
LAB (version R2015b; MathWorks, 
Natick, Mass). For statistical analyses, 
the level of significance was set to P , 
.05. The relative signal intensity change 
at T1r-weighted DGE imaging (DGEr 
DGEr) was calculated as proposed by 
Schuenke et al (16) and is given by 
the relative signal intensity difference 
between S(t), the T1r-weighted signal 
intensity acquired at time point t, and a 
reference signal (Sref) obtained by aver-
aging all approximately 20 T1r-weight-
ed signals acquired before the glucose 
injection, as follows:
 
 
All DGEr time–signal intensity curves 
and images were rendered by using an 
average of five consecutive measure-
ments per data point.
T1r-weighted DGE MR Imaging in Healthy 
Volunteers
Before T1r-weighted DGE MR imaging, 
high-spatial-resolution three-dimension-
al T2- and T1-weighted MPRAGE imag-
ing was performed at 7.0 T to enable 
targeted selection of two-dimensional 
axial sections at the level of the basal 
ganglia. Contrast changes at DGE MR 
imaging were analyzed both qualitatively 
by means of visual inspection and quan-
titatively to systematically evaluate phys-
iologic gray matter glucose uptake in 
the normal brain. Accordingly, a region 
of interest (ROI) was selected on T1-
weighted MPRAGE images in gray mat-
ter (head of the caudate nucleus: mean 
ROI = 119.2 mm2, range = 101.2–144.5 
mm2) and contralateral white matter 
(mean ROI = 178.5 mm2, range = 135.8–
208.1 mm2). All ROIs were drawn free-
hand by a neuroradiologist (A.R.) with 8 
years of experience. Data quantification 
and associated visualization were per-
formed at time point t approximately 
18 minutes after glucose injection in all 
subjects. The mean value, standard de-
viation, median, and interquartile range 
(IQR) were calculated for the two eval-
uated ROIs over all volunteers (ROI 1: 
white matter; ROI 2: gray matter, cau-
date nucleus) and displayed as boxplots. 
Subsequently, a Wilcoxon rank-sum test 
was performed to test for significant dif-
ferences between the two ROIs.
T1r-weighted DGE MR Imaging in Patients 
with Glioblastoma
In the nine patients with untreated glio-
blastoma, we compared the signal inten-
sity changes in the glucose-enhancing 
tumor region delineated on the DGE MR 
images (mean ROI = 516.4 mm2, range = 
219.6–1257.1 mm2) with that in the con-
tralateral normal-appearing white matter 
(mean ROI = 448.6 mm2, range = 213.9–
994.2 mm2). The mean value, standard 
deviation, median, and IQR were calcu-
lated and displayed as boxplots for the 
two evaluated ROIs over all patients (ROI 
1: contralateral normal-appearing white 
matter, ROI 2: glucose enhancement in 
tumor). Analyses were performed at 
the time of maximum glucose contrast 
enhancement. In case of patient motion 
during data acquisition, all evaluations 
used for statistical analysis, including the 
contrast visualization, were performed 
on the basis of data obtained before the 
onset of motion. A Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test was performed to test for a signif-
icant difference between the glucose 
enhancement in tumor and contralat-
eral normal-appearing white matter. 
Areas of high signal intensity within 
the tumor region at DGE MR imaging 
were visually compared with the lesion 
delineated on conventional gadolinium-
enhanced T1-weighted images and rCBF 
and rCBV maps, both obtained at 3.0 T. 
Furthermore, DGEr time–signal inten-
sity curves were analyzed to assess the 
dynamic characteristics of the glucose 
enhancement.
Results
T1r-weighted DGE MR Imaging in Healthy 
Volunteers
Increased signal intensities relative to 
that in white matter were observed in 
the basal ganglia, the choroid plexus, 
and cortical areas at T1r-weighted 
DGE MR imaging. Figure 1, A, shows 
the fusion image of an unenhanced T1-
weighted MPRAGE axial image and a 
T1r-weighted DGE image in one healthy 
volunteer, revealing increased signal in-
tensity—particularly in the head of the 
caudate nucleus, the thalamus, and the 
cortex.
A continuous signal intensity in-
crease was observed in the caudate 
nucleus ROI over the entire period of 
data acquisition in all volunteers (Fig 1, 
B). A saturation of gray matter signal 
intensity enhancement could not be ob-
served during the performed measure-
ment duration of up to 20 minutes.
On average, the blood glucose 
level of all volunteers increased by 5.2 
mmol/L during the course of glucose 
administration (Table). The peak signal 
intensity increase in the evaluated gray 
matter ROI varied between 2.6% and 
6.0% among the four volunteers.

healthy volunteers at DGE MR imag-
ing was also apparent in patients in all 
cases where the image sections covered 
the basal brain regions. In one patient, 
the signal intensity observed in the 
choroid plexus and the thalamic nuclei 
at DGE MR imaging (DGEr = 1.76%) 
was distinctly higher than that in the 
glioblastoma tumor (DGEr = 1.13%) 
(Fig E1 [online]). The comparison of 
DGE MR images with rCBV and rCBF 
maps revealed partial overlapping of 
the glucose- and gadolinium-enhanced 
contrast, especially in the lateral ven-
tricular choroid plexus and, though less 
pronounced, in gray matter regions of 
the basal ganglia and the cortex. In the 
tumor region, however, distinct regional 
differences were observed between the 
DGE MR imaging and perfusion MR 
imaging contrasts (Figs 3, E1 [online]).
Figure E2 (online) illustrates the 
glucose-enhanced areas, with magnifi-
cation of the tumor region, and DGEr 
time–signal intensity curves in three rep-
resentative patients. The signal intensity 
(DGEr = 0.08%, IQR = 0.44%, mean = 
0.16% 6 0.27) (P , .0001) (Fig 2, B). 
We suspected that one patient (patient 
9, Table) did not comply with the re-
quest to fast; this might have had an ef-
fect on the signal intensity increase at 
DGE MR imaging. In this patient, the 
increase in measured signal intensity 
after glucose injection (DGEr = 1.40% 
6 0.24) was relatively low compared 
with the total range measured in the 
patient cohort, which varied between 
1% and 8.2%.
DGE MR images displayed regions 
of increased signal intensity that did not 
correspond to enhancing regions on the 
gadolinium-enhanced images (Figs 3, 
E1 [online]). In particular, pronounced 
glucose uptake could be observed ad-
jacent to the gadolinium ring enhance-
ment on DGE MR images beyond the 
borders of the disrupted blood-brain 
barrier as displayed on gadolinium-
enhanced images (Figs 3, E1 [online]).

basal ganglia structures observed in

caudate nucleus ROI for all healthy vol-
unteers (DGEr = 4.59%, IQR = 2.35%,

in white matter ROI (DGEr = 0.65%, 
IQR = 0.70%, mean = 0.64% 6 0.41) 
(P = .028) (Fig 2, A).
T1r-weighted DGE MR Imaging in Patients 
with Glioblastoma
T1r-weighted DGE MR imaging en-
abled the identification of increased 
glucose uptake in the brain region that 
directly corresponded to the tumor 
area in all patients, as confirmed with 
T2-weighted images acquired at 7.0 T 
and coregistered gadolinium-enhanced 
T1-weighted images obtained with the 
3.0-T clinical MR unit. The median sig-
nal intensity in the tumor region seen 
at T1r-weighted DGE MR imaging 
for all patients (DGEr = 2.02%, IQR 
= 3.20%, mean = 3.25% 6 2.43) was 
significantly higher than that in contra-
lateral normal-appearing white matter

at 7.0 T. Areas of high signal intensity at T1r-weighted DGE MR imaging are seen in basal ganglia and some cortical areas. 
Blood glucose level increased from 4.3 mmol/L (before MR imaging and after a 6-hour fasting period) to 8.8 mmol/L (after MR 
imaging) approximately 20 minutes after glucose injection. B, Graph illustrates time-resolved DGEr for all volunteers in caudate 
nucleus (solid lines) and white matter (dashed lines), with five images averaged per data point. Red shaded area indicates ap-
proximate period of intravenous glucose administration (approximately 2 minutes). Continuous signal intensity increase can be 
observed in gray matter ROIs over whole measurement duration in all subjects, whereas signal intensities in white matter ROIs 
do not change markedly. Although motion artifact is apparent in data of volunteer 3 after beginning of glucose injection, signal 
intensity subsequently increased continuously. The most pronounced effects were detected in volunteer 2, who differed by sex 
(she was the only female volunteer) and had a lower body weight than the other subjects.

physiologic glucose uptake, in both an-
imals and humans, encourages the hy-
pothesis that the technique may allow 
functional glucose imaging without the 
need for radioisotopes.
By applying T1r-weighted DGE MR 
imaging to patients with untreated glio-
blastoma, it was shown that increased 
signal intensity in the region that di-
rectly corresponds to the tumor or 
peritumoral edema was present in all 
patients. The finding that the glucose-
enhanced areas partially overlap but still 
differ from those on standard gadolini-
um-enhanced T1-weighted images is in 
agreement with the results of Xu et al 
(14), who obtained similar findings in 
two patients with glioblastoma by em-
ploying the glucoCEST technique. In 
contrast to gadolinium-based contrast 
agents, which are confined to the vas-
cular and extracellular extravascular 
spaces, glucose is further transported 
into the intracellular compartment. 
Thus, glucose-based contrast enhance-
ment could in principle provide informa-
tion on both tumor perfusion and intra-
cellular glucose uptake. Our data from 
healthy volunteers and patients indicate 
contributions of both effects. The partial 
overlap between the areas of increased 
signal intensity on DGE MR images and 
rCBV and rCBF maps, especially in 
the highly vascularized choroid plexus 
and also, but less pronounced, in gray 
matter regions, suggests a correlation 
between DGE MR imaging and perfu-
sion MR imaging. From the observation 
that the glucose-enhanced tumor region 
displayed distinct differences compared 
with that seen on both gadolinium-en-
hanced T1-weighted and perfusion im-
ages, we infer that the signal intensity 
seen at T1r-weighted DGE MR imaging 
originates not solely from the extracel-
lular extravascular spaces and intravas-
cular spaces but also from intracellular 
spaces. Furthermore, the continuous 
signal intensity increase over more than 
20 minutes in gray matter regions in 
healthy volunteers is a strong indication 
of intracerebral glucose accumulation 
and, potentially, glucose metabolism.
Glucose uptake of human glioma 
was previously assessed with vari-
ous PET techniques by using different 
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that T1r-
weighted DGE contrast can be obtained 
with sufficient sensitivity and temporal 
resolution to quantitatively image brain 
glucose physiology in healthy humans 
and pathophysiologically increased glu-
cose uptake of tumors in patients with 
glioblastoma at a field strength of 7.0 T.
T1r-weighted DGE MR imaging re-
vealed that increased glucose uptake 
can be detected in gray matter regions 
of the normal and tumor-affected hu-
man brain. Our findings agree with re-
sults of proton nuclear MR (hydrogen 
1 [1H]) spectroscopy (20) and fluoro-
deoxyglucose PET (21,22) studies in 
humans, which demonstrate a dis-
tinct, increased glucose concentration 
in gray matter tissue. Recently, Jin et 
al (13) also reported increased gray 
matter uptake at T1r-based DGE MR 
imaging by using 2-deoxy-d-glucose in 
mice. The finding that T1r-based DGE 
MR imaging allowed for visualization of 
within the tumor in glioblastoma areas 
was heterogeneous (Fig E2 [online]). 
Across the patient cohort, three types of 
DGEr time–signal intensity curves could 
be differentiated within the tumor area: 
(a) immediate signal intensity increase 
(defined as maximum signal intensity 
within 3 minutes after the beginning of 
glucose injection) and subsequent de-
crease in three patients, (b) continuous 
signal intensity increase over the entire 
measurement duration in three patients, 
and (c) slow continuous increase (de-
fined as maximum signal intensity within 
8 minutes after the beginning of glucose 
injection) followed by decrease of the 
signal intensity in three patients.
No adverse effects of glucose injec-
tions were noted in patients and volun-
teers. One patient had relatively high 
blood glucose levels after glucose ad-
ministration (blood glucose level = 12.0 
mmol/L 20 minutes after injection). 
This patient was undergoing steroid 
therapy, which might have altered the 
insulin response to hyperglycemia.

between glucose-enhancing tumor regions (median DGEr = 2.02%, IQR = 3.20, mean = 
3.25% 6 2.43) and contralateral normal-appearing white matter (median DGEr = 0.08%, IQR 
= 0.44, mean = 0.16% 6 0.27) of all patients (P , .0001).

intensity curves at T1r-weighted DGE 
MR imaging may provide additional in-
formation on tissue-specific properties 
that might be linked to tumor biology 
because diverse profiles of enhance-
ment and glucose travel time were 
observed in tumor tissue. However, 
the sensitivity of T1r-weighted DGE 
caused by physiologic glucose metabo-
lism makes the delineation of intracra-
nial tumors challenging (30). CEST and 
CESL DGE MR imaging approaches are 
based on difference imaging, a feature 
that eliminates the problem of contrast 
attenuation due to high background sig-
nal intensity. Furthermore, time–signal 
isotopes (eg, 
18F fluorodeoxyglucose 
[23–26], 1-carbon 11 [11C] glucose 
[23]), hyperpolarized 13C MR spec-
troscopy (27), and 1H nuclear MR 
spectroscopy (28). However, previous 
approaches only provided relatively 
low diagnostic accuracy (10,29) and 
the high background signal intensity

Because rCBV and rCBF strongly correlate, only the more robust rCBV maps are shown here. (e) Fusion image of gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted and T1r-weighted

gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image) and beyond the borders of blood-brain barrier disruption (e). Some regions of increased glucose uptake cannot be delineated 
on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, and perfusion images. Partial overlap can be observed between DGE MR image and rCBV map.

MR imaging to physiologic changes in 
brain gray matter glucose concentration 
must be considered when interpreting 
glucose uptake of tumors close to gray 
matter regions.
Limitations of our study must be ac-
knowledged. The small number of sub-
jects (n = 13) is a limitation. The optimal 
injection time and glucose concentration 
has not yet been defined. Because our 
manual injection time was in the range 
of 1 minute 30 seconds to 3 minutes, 
the obtained contrast might be attenu-
ated compared with that with bolus ad-
ministration. Because we acquired only 
two-dimensional axial brain sections, 
the postprocess correction of extensive 
out-of-plane motion was not possible. 
Consequently, for application in clinical 
routine, we suggest the use of three-di-
mensional MR imaging readouts, which 
can be combined with the T1r-weighted 
preparation module. The fact that CEST 
and CESL approaches are based on dif-
ference imaging necessitates the acqui-
sition of baseline measurements, which 
leads to an additional acquisition time of 
about 2 minutes. This time could further 
be shortened by reducing the number 
of baseline measurements. Although no 
adverse effects were observed, because 
of the relatively high blood glucose level 
measured in one patient who received 
corticosteroids it may be questioned if 
steroid therapy should be a moderating 
criterion for glucose-enhanced MR im-
aging. Furthermore, the importance of 
fasting before DGE MR imaging should 
also be investigated in future studies. 
Because 7.0-T MR units are expensive 
and currently not widely available, the 
immediate applicability of the presented 
technique is limited. However, the CESL-
based approaches could potentially be 
transferred to imaging units at clinical 
field strength, as shown in simulations of 
Bloch-McConnell equations (10).
In conclusion, the obtained dynamic 
glucose contrast enhancement enabled 
the identification of glucose uptake in 
gray matter structures of the brain 
and the delineation of pathophysiologi-
cally increased glucose uptake in glio-
blastoma, both with a high temporal 
resolution of about 7 seconds. T1r-
weighted DGE MR imaging may allow
