Engineering prokaryotic channels for control
of mammalian tissue excitability
Hung X. Nguyen1, Robert D. Kirkton1 & Nenad Bursac1
The ability to directly enhance electrical excitability of human cells is hampered by the lack of
methods to efficiently overexpress large mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC).
Here we describe the use of small prokaryotic sodium channels (BacNav) to create de novo
excitable human tissues and augment impaired action potential conduction in vitro. Lentiviral
co-expression of specific BacNav orthologues, an inward-rectifying potassium channel, and
connexin-43 in primary human fibroblasts from the heart, skin or brain yields actively
conducting cells with customizable electrophysiological phenotypes. Engineered fibroblasts
(‘E-Fibs’) retain stable functional properties following extensive subculture or differentiation
into myofibroblasts and rescue conduction slowing in an in vitro model of cardiac interstitial
fibrosis. Co-expression of engineered BacNav with endogenous mammalian VGSCs enhances
action potential conduction and prevents conduction failure during depolarization by elevated
extracellular K þ, decoupling or ischaemia. These studies establish the utility of engineered
BacNav channels for induction, control and recovery of mammalian tissue excitability.

oltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) exist in all animal
organisms and govern processes fundamental to life
including neuronal communication, muscle contractions
or hormonal release1. In electrically excitable tissues, VGSCs
enable firing and spread of action potentials (APs) and their loss-
of-function mutations2 cause a variety of neuronal3–6, cardiac7,8
and skeletal muscle9,10 disorders. Similarly, acute tissue injuries
resulting in permanent excitability loss (for example, stroke,
spinal cord injury and heart attack) are associated with long-term
disability and death. In addition to excitable tissues, the VGSCs
are expressed in many unexcitable cells including macrophages,
microglia and islet b-cells, where they play important roles
in phagocytosis, migration, insulin secretion and other cellular
processes11. The ion-conducting a-subunits of mammalian
VGSCs
have
four
structurally
homologous
domains,
each
consisting of B300 amino acids12. These four domains are
simultaneously transcribed and translated from a single, relatively
large (46 kb) gene. This large gene size precludes stable and
efficient expression of mammalian VGSCs in primary cells, a
strategy that could potentially lead to new remedies for impaired
tissue excitability.
The recent discovery of a large bacterial VGSC family (BacNav)
has provided novel insights into the structure and biophysical
properties of eukaryotic VGSCs13–17. In contrast to their
eukaryotic counterparts, BacNav13 consist of four identical
domains, individually transcribed and translated from single
genes of only B900 bp in size. Although the small size of BacNav
facilitates their overexpression and purification for crystallo-
graphy studies18, it is plausible that BacNav genes could be
efficiently packaged into viral vectors, either alone or with
other ion channel genes, and used to stably introduce or modify
electrical
excitability
of
mammalian
tissues.
Furthermore,
utilization of BacNav orthologues with diverse biophysical
properties13–16,19,20, combined with targeted channel mutations,
may allow custom engineering of cellular electrophysiological
phenotypes
tailored
to
specific
tissue
types,
diseases
and
individuals.
Here we combined electrophysiological, computational and
genetic engineering techniques to establish a versatile BacNav-
based platform that enables stable conversion of unexcitable
primary human fibroblasts into AP conducting cells that can
successfully recover conduction slowing in an in vitro model of
cardiac interstitial fibrosis. Moreover, we demonstrate that direct
expression
of
engineered
BacNav
channels in mammalian
excitable cells can enhance their excitability and prevent loss of
AP conduction in pathological conditions when endogenous
Na þ channels fail to activate.
Results
Genetic engineering of actively conducting human fibroblasts.
To stably convert unexcitable primary fibroblasts into actively
conducting cells (named engineered fibroblasts or ‘E-Fibs’), we
first explored a BacNav variant from Roseobacter denitrificans,
NavRosD G217A, shown in our preliminary tests to be capable of
generating AP propagation when transfected in a monolayer of
HEK293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1 and connexin-43 (Cx43).
We generated a high-titre bi-cistronic lentivirus pRRL-CMV-
RosDG217A-P2A-eGFP-Kir2.1
encoding
both
NavRosD
G217A
and
inward-rectifier
potassium
channel
Kir2.1
(gene KCNJ2) fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein
(eGFP) (eGFP-Kir2.1), separated by the self-cleaving peptide
P2A. Adult human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) transduced with
this virus stably expressed inward-rectifier K þ current, IK1
(Fig. 1a,b), and bacterial Na þ current, INaRosD G217A (Fig. 1c,d), at
much higher levels compared with endogenous currents, and
exhibited
a
significantly
hyperpolarized
resting
membrane
potential of � 78.4±0.2 mV (n ¼ 6) compared with that of
wild-type (wt)-HDFs ( � 23.3±2.9 mV; n ¼ 5). The resulting
voltage dependencies of activation and inactivation of NavRosD
G217A
(Fig.
1e)
in
transduced
HDFs
were
similar
to
those previously reported in transfected HEK293s (ref. 15).
Importantly, transduced HDFs became electrically excitable,
whereby
injection
of
1 ms
current
pulses
of
increasing
amplitude elicited reproducible firing of an ‘all-or-none’ AP
(Fig. 1f). These results demonstrated the ability of BacNav to yield
creation of de novo electrically excitable cells.
To
enable
electrical
coupling
in
excitable
HDFs,
we
co-transduced them with a pRRL-CMV-Cx43-P2A-mCherry
lentivirus. Transduced cells robustly expressed membrane-bound
Cx43 gap junctions (Fig. 1g), which resulted in improved
intercellular coupling compared with wt-HDFs as revealed by
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching21, albeit not to the
same level as measured in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1h).
These engineered HDFs (E-HDFs) were then cultured at
confluence in 2 cm diameter monolayers in a random or
aligned configuration (Supplementary Fig. 1). When electri-
cally stimulated by a bipolar platinum electrode, randomly
oriented E-HDFs supported circular AP spread at an average
conduction velocity (CV) of 3.63±0.23 cm s � 1 (Fig. 1i and
Supplementary Video 1). As expected, aligned E-HDFs exhibited
elliptical
(anisotropic)
AP spread
with higher
CVs along
(3.86±0.14 cm s � 1, n ¼ 5) versus across (2.07±0.19 cm s � 1,
n ¼ 5) cell orientation (Fig. 1j and Supplementary Video 1).
Although the above approach enabled AP propagation in initially
unexcitable human fibroblasts, CVs were low, which could be at
least in part attributed to the relatively slow activation kinetics of
NavRosD G217A.
Improved E-Fib electrical properties with NavSheP mutants.
To augment the excitability and conduction of E-HDFs, we
developed a combined computational and experimental strategy
to screen and identify BacNav variants with more favourable
properties (Fig. 2a). We set to explore the BacNav orthologue
from Shewanella putrefaciens, NavSheP, for its fast current
kinetics15.
As
the
wt
NavSheP
channel
has
a
highly
hyperpolarized voltage dependency of steady-state inactivation,
it does not yield AP firing when co-expressed with Kir2.1. We
thus proceeded to shift the activation and inactivation curves of
NavSheP to more depolarized voltages based on the previous
studies of specific residues in NaChBac channels22 and significant
homology between different BacNav orthologues (Supplementary
Fig. 2); we created a library of NavSheP mutants where either the
D60 or E43 residue was substituted with other standard amino
acids. These 38 NavSheP mutants were transiently expressed in a
monoclonal HEK293 line stably expressing Kir2.1 and the
resulting sodium current was recorded by voltage clamp. The
E43 mutants exhibited highly depolarized voltage dependence of
activation (Supplementary Table 1); therefore, we focused on
detailed characterization of D60 mutants. The D60 mutant
channels exhibited a wide range of steady-state and kinetic
parameters (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1)
and predominantly exhibited fast kinetics compared with the
NavRosD channel (Supplementary Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary
Table 1). Based on the recorded parameters, we applied
computational
modelling to infer AP upstroke,
threshold,
duration and CV that would result from the same expression
level of different NavSheP mutants in an electrically coupled,
Kir2.1 HEK293 line (Fig. 2b–e and Supplementary Fig. 4) and
constructed NavSheP D60X-Kir2.1 lentiviruses for three D60X
mutants (D60A, D60N and D60S) that exhibited the steepest AP

 upstrokes and highest CVs among different BacNav models. All
three mutants exhibited significantly faster kinetics compared
with NavRosD G217A in transduced cells (Fig. 2f,g), which
allowed generation of APs with shorter duration and sharper
upstroke velocity (Fig. 2h–j). Co-transduction of these viruses
with Cx43 in HDFs yielded a 2.5-fold improvement in CV
compared with the use of NavRosD (Fig. 2k,l and Supplementary
Video 2). This demonstrated the potential for combining BacNav
mutagenesis and computational modelling, to engineer primary
human fibroblasts with desired electrophysiological phenotypes.
Fine-tuning of E-Fib electrical properties via FACS. The use of
fluorescence reporters in multi-cistronic lentiviruses (for example,
pRRL-CMV-SheP D60N-P2A-eGFP-Kir2.1) allowed us to further
vary INaSheP and IK1 levels, and characterize their functional
effects on E-HDFs. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS), we sorted E-HDFs into three populations with low,
medium and high GFP expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 5a),
which yielded corresponding low, medium and high levels of IK1
(Fig. 3a) and INaSheP (Fig. 3b), and distinct changes in AP shape
(Fig. 3c). Specifically, a trend towards more hyperpolarized
resting membrane potential (Fig. 3d, one-way analysis of
variance, P ¼ 0.15) and the significantly higher maximum
upstroke velocity (Fig. 3e) could be attributed to higher IK1 and
INaSheP, respectively, whereas the increased APD (Fig. 3f) resulted
from net depolarizing effect of increased IK1 and INaSheP on
membrane repolarization. Although higher AP upstroke velocities
expectedly yielded higher CVs (Fig. 3g,h), this effect was
moderate, which we hypothesized was due to simultaneous
increase in IK1 along with INaSheP. We thus modelled concurrent
increase in IK1 and INaSheP to simulate the experiment (model 1;
Supplementary Fig. 6) and compared resulting CVs with those
caused by an increase in INaSheP alone (model 2; Supplementary
Fig. 6). Despite the same AP upstroke velocities in both
models (Supplementary Fig. 6a), CV in model 1 increased less
(Supplementary Fig. 6b), because more depolarizing current was
needed to overcome high IK1, reach threshold and elicit AP
(Supplementary Fig. 6c). Examining a wide range of channel
conductances (�
GNa and �
GK1) further revealed that although
threshold current required to elicit AP is primarily sensitive to
level of IK1 (Supplementary Fig. 6d), AP upstroke velocity is
mainly dependent on INaSheP (Supplementary Fig. 6e), with these
two currents inducing opposite effects on CV (Supplementary

 Fig. 6f). Furthermore, as E-HDFs were also transduced with
pRRL-CMV-Cx43-P2A-mCherry lentivirus, sorting cells based
on mCherry fluorescence level (Supplementary Fig. 5c) allowed us
to vary Cx43 expression and gap junctional coupling of
engineered cells. Optical mapping revealed that E-HDFs with
higher mCherry/Cx43 expression supported faster AP propaga-
tion (Fig. 3i), whereas contrary to eGFP sorting (Supplementary
Fig. 5b), mCherry sorting had no effect on APD80 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5d). Simulation results further revealed that inter-
cellular coupling strength does not influence the relative effects of
varying IK1 and INaSheP on CV (Supplementary Fig. 6g).
Robustness of E-Fib electrical phenotype. To test whether
E-HDFs can maintain stable electrophysiological phenotype
under various perturbations, we expanded them 500-fold over a
4-week period, either directly or after 2 freeze–thaw cycles. In
both cases, expanded E-HDFs retained proliferative potential
(Fig. 4a) and were able to undergo additional rounds of expansion
(for example, 100-fold, 4 passages; Fig. 4b). In addition, as
fibroblasts can differentiate into smooth muscle actin expressing
myofibroblasts during wound healing and tissue repair23, we
treated the expanded E-HDFs with 10 ng ml � 1 transforming
growth factor-b1 for 7 days, to induce their conversion to
myofibroblasts
(Fig.
4c,d).
Subsequent
electrophysiological
analysis revealed that despite significant cell expansion or
myofibroblast differentiation, the IK1, INaSheP (Fig. 4e,f) and AP
characteristics (Fig. 4g–i) of E-HDFs remained unchanged,
demonstrating
the
stability
of
the
acquired
functional
phenotype. The ability of these cells to undergo repeated
freeze–thaw cycles without phenotypic alterations suggested the
potential for off-the-shelf delivery applications. Electrophysio-
logical phenotype of E-HDFs remained stable until the cells
reached
senescence
(after
additional
eight
passages
and
B106-fold expansion; Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). Furthermore,
using a classical heterologous expression system—monoclonal
HEK293 line expressing Cx43, Kir2.1 and NavSheP D60A—stable

 (Supplementary Fig. 7e–g), with cells adapting to higher pacing
rates by decreasing APD80 and CV (Supplementary Fig. 7h,i).
Applicability to other sources of human unexcitable cells. To
further demonstrate the versatility of this approach, we used the
Kir2.1-NavSheP D60N lentivirus to stably convert human
ventricular fibroblasts (HVFs), human astrocytes (HAs) and
HEK293s into engineered electrically excitable cells (E-HVFs,
E-HAs and E-HEK293, respectively). All engineered cell types
displayed strong INaSheP and IK1, and fired APs on stimulation
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Expression of the Kir2.1 channels
hyperpolarized the resting membrane potentials in all transduced
cells to a similar value (Fig. 4j), whereas similar INaSheP levels
resulted in comparable upstroke velocities (Fig. 4k). Significant
differences in AP duration among different cell types (Fig. 4l)
could be attributed to differences in their endogenous currents
(Fig. 4m) and potentially other differences in epigenetic, post-
transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of ion channel
expression and function. Collectively, these results confirmed the
robustness of the BacNav engineering approach against the
starting unexcitable cell phenotype.
E-Fibs improve conduction in model of interstitial fibrosis. To
test whether E-Fibs could improve impaired AP conduction in
native excitable tissues, we designed a zig-zag micropattern of
neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 9a),
which mimics the tortuous electrical conduction of cardiac
tissue
with
interstitial
fibrosis24,25.
The
cardiomyocyte
zig-zag micropattern displayed normal AP propagation in the
longitudinal direction (Supplementary Fig. 9b), but significantly
slowed down transverse CV (3.2±0.4 cm s � 1; Supplementary
Fig.
9c),
which
was
fully
rescued
(12.0±0.5 cm s � 1)
by
the
electrical
coupling
of
actively
conducting
E-HDFs
and cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5b,c, Supplementary Fig. 9g and
Supplementary video 3). In contrast, unexcitable wt-HDFs or
excitable

only
by
endogenous junctions (no Cx43 overexpression) did not alter
the transverse conduction (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 9d,e),
whereas unexcitable HDFs with overexpressed Cx43 yielded only
a small conduction improvement (to 6.5±0.3 cm s � 1; Fig. 5c and
Supplementary Fig. 9f). All groups had similar AP durations
(Fig. 5d); thus, wavelength differences (Fig. 5e) reflected the
differences in CV. Importantly, these studies suggested that slow
electrical propagation in cardiac tissues with interstitial fibrosis
could be significantly improved if fibroblasts were engineered to
actively conduct APs by becoming both excitable and robustly
coupled.
BacNav augment and rescue mammalian tissue excitability.
Our computational results showed that select BacNav mutant
(NavSheP D60A) displayed comparable AP upstroke and slightly
lower CV than mammalian Nav1.5 channel in an excitable cell
model (Fig. 2d,e), suggesting that in addition to custom design of
de novo excitable cells and tissues, BacNav channels could be
exploited to directly manipulate or augment26,27 mammalian
tissue excitability. Specifically, when lentivirally expressed in
cardiomyocyte cultures, NavSheP D60A channels significantly
improved CV from 15.9±0.8 to 26.1±0.7 cm s � 1 without

D60A could increase the resistance to conduction failure in
cardiomyocyte cultures that underwent regional ischaemia after
being covered with a glass coverslip33 (Fig. 6e). During ischaemia,
cardiomyocytes exhibited gradual conduction slowing (Fig. 6f,g)

 Discussion
Since their discovery 15 years ago13, prokaryotic Na þ channels
have
contributed
greatly
to
understanding
structure16,20,
function34,35
and
pharmacology36
of
the
more
complex
eukaryotic VGSCs. Yet, it has remained unexplored if large
diversity and small gene size of BacNav could be employed to
stably modify and augment the excitability of mammalian tissues,
a feat difficult to achieve using large mammalian VGSCs. In this
study, we presented a combined experimental and computation
strategy for use of BacNav channels in the de novo induction and
control of mammalian tissue excitability. Our goal was to develop
a versatile platform that would be cost-effective, applicable to a
variety of cell types and amenable to rapid production of large
quantities of excitable cells for off-the-shelf use.
Previously, we applied a non-viral stepwise expression of
cardiac Na þ channel Nav1.5, inward rectifier K þ channel Kir2.1
and gap junctional protein Cx43, combined with antibiotic
selection, to generate a stable monoclonal HEK293 line capable of
active AP conduction32. Other proof-of-concept studies applied
adenoviral expressions of mammalian VGSCs to induce or
modify excitability in primary tissues37–39; however, these effects
were transient and unsuitable for long-term studies or the
development of antiarrhythmic gene therapies38,39. Although the
use of split-intein-mediated protein trans-splicing strategy40
might be adapted in the future to induce stable expression of
mammalian VGSCs in primary cells, efficacy of this approach
may be limited due to the need for co-transduction of
two or more viruses to reconstitute functional channels. To
circumvent the need for expressing large mammalian VGSCs, we
exploited much smaller BacNav genes and designed high-titre
multi-cistronic lentiviruses coding minimum sets of ion channels
required for stable and efficient induction of excitability in
primary cells. In fact, using BacNav þ Kir2.1 lentiviruses, human
and rodent fibroblasts were routinely transduced with 90%
efficiency without any loss of cell viability (not shown). Including
a fluorescent reporter in the same virus allowed us to further
purify transduced cells and fine-tune their electrical properties
(Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5).
Importantly, lentivirally expressed ion currents in all engi-
neered fibroblasts were much larger than their endogenous
currents (Fig. 1). As such, resulting electrophysiological pheno-
type of engineered cells was relatively insensitive to the cell’s
epigenetic state and both predictable in silico and for the most
part reproducible among different cell types in vitro (Fig. 4j–l and
Supplementary Fig. 8). The ability to generate actively conducting
HVFs, in particular, suggested a potential therapeutic strategy
whereby in situ fibroblast engineering could improve impaired
conduction in fibrotic heart tissues. As a proof of concept, we
showed that well-coupled and excitable (but not weakly coupled
and/or unexcitable) fibroblasts successfully restored normal
neonatal rat cardiomyocyte conduction in an in vitro model of
interstitial fibrosis (Fig. 5). On the other hand, distinct forms of
cardiac fibroses, differing in size, and cellular and non-cellular
components can result from various types of heart disease or
injury41. In situ engineering of actively conducting fibroblasts,
while potentially beneficial in improving cardiac conduction in
small regions of interstitial or diffuse fibrosis where these cells
come in close contacts with cardiomyocytes, may not prove as
effective in large cardiac scars with low cellularity. Of note is also
that without the prominent Ca2 þ currents, engineered fibroblasts

 are unlikely to spontaneously fire APs or be a source of triggered
activity, which could potentially make them less arrhythmogenic
compared
with
the
use
of
pluripotent
stem
cell-derived
cardiomyocytes42,43.
Furthermore, transduction of mammalian excitable tissue
cultures with specific BacNav mutants augmented or rescued
conduction in healthy (Supplementary Fig. 10) and pathological
(depolarization,
decoupling
and
ischaemia;
Fig.
6
and
Supplementary Fig. 11) conditions, suggesting that BacNav-based
gene therapies could be targeted directly to excitable cells. In
addition, previous studies have shown that BacNav could be
converted into Ca2 þ-selective channel (BacCav) by substituting
three amino acid residues of the selectivity filter with Aspar-
tate19,44,45. Hence, stable expression of engineered BacNav
channels or their Ca2 þ-selective derivatives may enable direct
therapeutic effects on excitable and unexcitable cells whose
function relies on voltage-gated Na þ or Ca2 þ channels.
Although in this study we focused on altering specific amino
acid residues (E43 or D60) in a particular BacNav orthologue
(NavSheP), various combinations of other BacNav orthologues
and residues18,46,47 could be explored to customize phenotype of
engineered or native excitable cells. For example, mutations in the
‘glycine hinge’ region in some BacNav orthologues could change
channel inactivation rate15, and along with tuning of Kir2.1
expression via an independent promoter, could be used to control
AP duration to avoid arrhythmogenic dispersion of refractoriness
if E-Fibs were used for cardiac cell or in situ gene therapy.
Furthermore, replacing the highly conserved negative residues
(E70 and D91) of BacNav voltage-sensitive domain with positively
charged residues could shift activation to more hyperpolarized
voltages48 and be used to reduce AP threshold. Similarly,
substituting the negatively charged residues in the neck region
of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the BacNav channel
into glycine could destabilize the helix conformation of this
region, decrease the depolarization energy required for channel
opening49 and further augment cell excitability and conduction.
Furthermore, a recent study by Arrigoni et al.50 showed that
BacNav CTD plays a critical role in voltage dependence of
activation,
suggesting
CTD
swapping
among
different
orthologues could provide yet another method to control
excitability of engineered cells.
Basic studies in ‘lower’ organisms, including prokaryotes, have
led to versatile approaches to manipulate and study mammalian
biology. Recent examples include optogenetics51 and genome-
editing techniques52 that, in addition to becoming powerful
research tools, have been extensively investigated for potential
medical applications. In line with these undertakings, our work
supports expansion of prokaryotic ion channel research to basic
studies of mammalian tissue excitability and development of new
human therapies.
Methods
Screening of bacterial sodium channels. To engineer excitable cells, we first
explored use of NaChBac channel, the longest studied BacNav orthologue13,17,45,53.
However, its slow recovery from inactivation yielded excitable cells with very low
maximum capture rate (o1 Hz). This prompted us to instead use NavRosD G217A
and NavSheP channels that were kindly provided by Dr Katsumasa Irie from Kyoto
University15. Libraries of SheP(D60X) and SheP(E43X) mutants were generated
using Quikchange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies), as

 per the manufacturer’s instructions. All the primers used are listed in
Supplementary Table 2. Each gene was subcloned into the mammalian expression
vector pCMV5(CuO)-IRES-GFP (Qbiogene) and transfected into HEK293
cells stably expressing Kir2.1 using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent
(Life Technologies). GFP fluorescence was usually detected after 12 h and cells were
patch clamped 24 h after transfection, to derive AP parameters.
Lentivirus production. Lentiviral plasmids were constructed from the pRRL-CMV
vector (a gift from Dr Inder Verma, Salk Institute). BacNav (NavRosD G217A or
NavSheP mutant, without a stop codon) was ligated with eGFP-Kir2.1 (Kir2.1
fused with eGFP at the amino terminus) via the viral P2A peptide54 before
being subcloned into pRRL-CMV, to create the bi-cistronic lentiviral plasmid
pRRL-CMV-BacNav-P2A-eGFP-Kir2.1. To enhance gap junction expression in
engineered cells, Cx43 (ref. 32) was linked with mCherry via P2A and subcloned
into the pRRL-CMV lentiviral plasmid (pRRL-CMV-Cx43-P2A-mCherry). In the
main text, BacNav-Kir2.1 and Cx43 lentiviruses refer to pRRL-CMV-BacNav-
P2A-eGFP-Kir2.1 and pRRL-CMV-Cx43-P2A-mCherry virus, respectively. Other
lentiviral constructs used in the study were pRRL-CMV-BacNav-P2A-Kir2.1-
T2A-eGFP and pRRL-CMV-BacNav-T2A-eGFP. High-titre lentiviruses were
produced using second generation lentiviral packaging system. Briefly, 293FT cells
(Life Technologies, R700-07) were co-transfected with lentiviral plasmid, packaging
plasmid psPAX2 and envelope plasmid pMD2.G (2:1:1 mass ratios) using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). Supernatant containing lentiviral particles
was collected 72 h after transfection, centrifuged (500 g, 10 min) and filtered
through 0.45 mm cellulose acetate filter (Corning) to remove cell debris before
combined with Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech) at 3:1 volume ratio for overnight
incubation at 4 �C. Concentrated lentiviral particles were harvested following
45 min centrifugation (1,500 g, 4 �C) and resuspended in 1/10 to 1/100 of the
original volume in DMEM medium. Plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G were obtained
from Didier Trono (Addgene plasmids #12260 and #12259).
Generation of engineered human fibroblasts. Primary adult HDFs
(Gibco, C-013-5C) were co-transduced with BacNav-Kir2.1 and Cx43 lentiviruses
at a density of 104 cells per cm2 in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC, PCS-201-030).
Five days after lentiviral transduction, GFP þ/mCherry þ cells were sorted by
FACS analysis, replated in fibroblast growth medium (basal medium supplemented
with fibroblast low-serum growth kit, ATCC, PCS-201-041) and assessed with
patch-clamp recordings and optical mapping at 1 week and 4 weeks after sorting.
Conversion of HDFs into myofibroblasts was induced by adding transforming
growth factor-b (10 ng ml � 1) into culture media for 5 days. Similar lentiviral
transduction protocol was repeated in HVFs (Lonza, CC-2904), HAs (Lonza,
CC-2565) and HEK293 cells (ATCC, CRL-1573).
Isotropic and anisotropic monolayers of HDFs. E-HDFs were seeded onto
22 mm-diameter Aclar (Electron Microscopy Sciences) coverslips coated with
fibronectin (Sigma, 15 mg ml � 1, 30 min) at a density of 5 � 104 cells per cm2 to
form isotropic monolayers. Anisotropic E-HDF monolayers were formed on
Aclar coverslips microcontact printed with a pattern of parallel fibronectin lines
(10 mm width, 10 mm spacing) as previously described55. Cells were cultured for
24 h to become confluent and form intercellular junctions followed by optical
mapping of AP propagation and immunostaining.
Micropatterned zig-zag cultures. All animals were treated in accordance with
protocols approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were enzymatically dissociated from
ventricles of 2-day-old Sprague–Dawley rats and enriched using differential
pre-plating56. Specifically, ventricles were excised, minced and incubated with 0.1%
trypsin overnight and dissociated in four sequential steps using 0.1% collagenase.
Isolated cells were centrifuged (5 min, 200 g) and further enriched by two 45 min
pre-plating steps to select for cardiomyocyte-enriched cells that remained
unattached after the second pre-plating. Zig-zag cultures were generated as
previously described25. Briefly, Aclar coverslips (22 mm diameter) were coated with
5 mg ml � 1 collagen I (rat tail, BD Biosciences) for 30 min, rinsed with PBS, then
micro-contact printed with a zig-zag network of fibronectin (100 mm-wide lines
spaced 100 mm apart and connected by 100 mm-wide transverse bridges staggered
every 6 mm). Cardiomyocytes were seeded at a density of 2 � 105 cells per cm2 in
DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco, 11320-033) supplemented with 10% calf serum and
10% horse serum, followed by a switch to 5% fetal bovine serum media at culture
day 2. The following day, E-HDFs were added to the cardiomyocyte zig-zag
cultures at a density of 2.5 � 104 cells per cm2. On day 5, co-cultured monolayers
were assessed for AP propagation by optical mapping and subsequently fixed for
immunostaining.
Immunostaining. Cell monolayers or tissue patches were fixed in 2% paraf-
ormaldehyde (15 min), permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X (30 min) and blocked in a
5:1 solution of 1% BSA and chicken serum (30 min). The following primary
antibodies (1 h incubation) were used: anti-sarcomeric a-actinin (Sigma, a7811,
1:200), anti-Cx43 (Life Technologies, 71-0700, 1:100), anti-vimentin (Sigma, v6630,
1:500), anti-smooth muscle actin (Sigma, a2547, 1:200), anti-GFAP
(BD Biosciences, 561483, 1:100) and anti-Ki67 (Abcam, ab15580, 1:200). Secondary
antibodies (1 h incubation) included the following: Alexa488 (Life Technologies,
A-21200 or A-21441, 1:200), Alexa594 (Life Technologies, A-21201 or A-21442,
1:200), Alexa647 (Life Technologies, A-21463, 1:200), Alexa488-conjugated
phalloidin (Life Technologies, A12379, 1:300) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Sigma, 1:300). All immunostaining steps were performed at room temperature.
Fluorescence images were acquired using inverted fluorescence (Nikon TE2000)
or confocal (Leica SP5) microscope and processed with ImageJ software.
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Functional coupling in wt and
Cx43-expressing HDFs was assessed using fluorescence recovery after photo-
bleaching21,57 as previously described58. Briefly, confluent HDF monolayers were
stained with Calcein AM dye (Molecular Probes, 0.5 mM in DMEM) for 20 min at
37 �C, washed with PBS and immersed again in fresh media. The target cell was
photobleached with a 488 nm Argon laser and subsequently imaged every 15 s for
6 min using an upright confocal microscope (Zeiss, LSM 510). The level of
fluorescence in the target cell was normalized to the fluorescence level in remote
unbleached cells and plot as a function of time post photobleaching.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Cells were briefly trypsinized, plated onto
poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips and left to attach for 5 h. Cells were then
transferred to a patch-clamp chamber perfused with Tyrode’s solution containing
(in mM): 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 0.33 NaH2PO4, 5 HEPES and 5
glucose. Patch pipettes were fabricated with tip resistances of 1–2 MO when filled
with pipette solution consisting of (in mM): 140 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2,
10 EGTA, 10 HEPES and 5 MgATP. Whole-cell voltage-clamp and current-clamp
recordings were acquired at room temperature (25 �C) and 37 �C, respectively,
using the Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments), filtered with a
10-kHz Bessel filter, digitized at 40 kHz and analysed using WinWCP software
(John Dempster, University of Strathclyde). To measure BacNav activation
properties, membrane voltage was stepped from a holding potential of � 100 mV
to varying 500 ms test potentials ( � 50 to 60 mV, increments of 10 mV).
Inactivation of BacNav was derived from peak currents measured at 0 mV after
varying 3 s prepulse potentials ( � 160 to � 30 mV, increments of 10 mV). For the
channels with more hyperpolarized activation and inactivation (NavSheP WT and
D60E), holding voltage for steady-state activation protocol was set at � 160 mV,
whereas steady-state inactivation protocol included prepulse potentials from
� 180 mV to � 30 mV. Steady-state IK1–V curve was constructed from the current
responses to varying 1 s test potentials ( � 130 to 50 mV, increments of 10 mV)
from a holding potential of � 40 mV. APs were elicited by injecting a 1 ms current
pulse at 1.1 � threshold amplitude.
Optical mapping of AP propagation. Cell monolayers or zig-zag cultures were
optically mapped with a 20 mm diameter hexagonal array of 504 optical fibres
(Redshirt Imaging), as previously described32,55,56. Specifically, cultures were
stained with a voltage-sensitive dye (Di-4-ANEPPS, 10 mM) for 5 min at room
temperature, transferred to a recording chamber filled with Tyrode’s solution at
37 �C and illuminated by a solid-state excitation light source (Lumencor, SOLA
SM) filtered through a 520±30 nm bandpass filter. Emitted red fluorescence
signals (l4590 nm) were collected by the optical fiber array, converted to voltage
signals by photodiodes and recorded at a 2.4 kHz sampling rate with a 750 mm
spatial resolution. AP propagation was triggered by a 10 ms, 1.2 � threshold, 1 Hz
stimulus from either a bipolar point electrode (in isotropic or anisotropic
monolayers of E-HDFs) or a line electrode (in the zig-zag cultures). Generation of
isochrone maps and calculation of CV, AP duration at 80% repolarization (APD80)
and impulse wavelength were performed using custom MATLAB software, as
previously described59,60.
Depolarization and decoupling studies. Similar to previous studies61, membrane
depolarization in Ex293 monolayers was induced by applying increasing doses of
KCl (in 1 mM increments starting from 5.4 mM). After 5 min equilibration at each
KCl dose, cells were paced at 1 Hz and AP conduction optically mapped. For gap
junction decoupling studies, PA (Sigma, 76168) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
and sonicated (10 min, 37 �C) to yield a stock concentration of 50 mM. Ex293
monolayers were exposed to increasing doses of PA (0, 20, 40 and 60 mM) and after
15 min equilibration at each dose, cells were paced at 1 Hz and AP conduction
optically mapped.
Regional ischaemia studies. Regional ischaemia in neonatal rat cardiomyocyte
monolayers was induced as described previously33,62. Briefly, 12 mm round glass
coverslip was placed onto the central area of a 22 mm cardiac monolayer to induce
regional ischaemia. Cells were continuously paced at 1 Hz and AP conduction
optically mapped every 1 min during ischaemia, until complete conduction failure
in the ischaemic region. CV, APD80 and optical AP amplitude measured at
the recording sites of the central ischemic region were normalized to corres-
ponding baseline values before ischemia. Recording site was defined as inactive
(not conducting) if its AP amplitude failed below 10% of baseline value.

 Computational modelling. Experimentally derived modelling parameters are
listed in Supplementary Table 3. The AP generation in HEK293 cells co-expressing
Kir2.1 and BacNav channels was simulated using the Hodgkin–Huxley formalism63
and the following differential equation:
dV
dt ¼ � 1
Cm
INaðV; tÞ þ IK1ðVÞ þ IendoðVÞ � IstimðV; tÞ
ð
Þ
ð1Þ
where V is the cell transmembrane potential, Cm is the total membrane capacitance,
INa is the BacNav channel current, IK1 is the inward-rectifier potassium current,
Iendo is the endogenous background current and Istim is the stimulus current. Based
on the similarities between BacNav and mammalian Cav channels13,45, the BacNav
conductance was modelled as a simple product of activation and inactivation gating
variables and INa was expressed using the following equation:
INaðV; tÞ¼ �
GNa�mðV; tÞ�hðV; tÞ�ðV � ENaÞ
ð2Þ
where �
GNa is the maximum conductance of the BacNav channel, m and h are the
first-order activation and inactivation gating variables, respectively, and ENa is the
sodium Nernst potential given in Supplementary Table 3. Mathematical model of
human Nav1.5 was adopted from a previous model of human ventricular tissue64
with a slightly modified inactivation time constant to better fit voltage clamp
recordings in Nav1.5-expressing HEK293 cells.
From the voltage-clamp activation and inactivation protocols, the steady-state
values of the gating variables as a function of V were plotted and fit to the
Boltzmann equation63, to derive the midpoint voltage and slope factor listed in
Supplementary Table 1:
m1¼

1 þ exp
V1=2 � V
Slope
�
� h1 ¼

1 þ exp
V � V1=2
Slope

ð3Þ
The initial and late phases of INa traces for each clamp potential were fit as single
exponentials to derive time constants of activation (tm) and inactivation (th) as
functions of V. The tm and th at V ¼ þ 20 mV are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Voltage-clamp recordings of inward-rectifying potassium current were used to
fit steady-state IK1 values to a time-independent Nygren et al.65 model as follows:
IK1¼ �
GK1
V � EK
1 þ e0:08754 V � EK � 18:87
ð
Þ
ð4Þ
where �
GK1 is the maximum conductance of the Kir2.1 channel and EK is the
potassium Nernst potential given in Supplementary Table 3.
Finally, the endogenous background current of wt HEK293 or HDF cells, Iendo
(in pA), was fit by a time-independent linear equation:
Iendo ¼ 2:6V þ 12:3 forHEK293
ð
Þ or Iendo¼0:53V þ 17:5 forHDF
ð
Þ
ð5Þ
where V is given in millivolts. Simulations of single-cell APs for different BacNav
mutants were performed using constant �
GK1 and �
GNa values (measured by patch
clamp in a monoclonal HEK293 line expressing Kir2.1, Cx43 and NavSheP D60A;
Supplementary Table 3), to allow direct comparisons of how kinetic properties of
BacNav on their own affect AP characteristics (upstroke velocity, APD80 and
threshold potential). As the whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were performed at
25 �C, to model AP generation at 37 �C, we scaled up EK and ENa from
Supplementary Table 3 by 310.15 �K/298.15 �K and further scaled INa, IK1 and Iendo
using Q-values of 2.7, 1.8 and 2.1, respectively.
To simulate AP propagation in HEK293 cells expressing different BacNav
mutants, we applied a continuous cable equation discretized using forward Euler’s
method66–68 as follows:
vm i þ 1; j
ð
Þ ¼ vm i; j
ð

ð
Þ � 2vm i; j
ð
Þ þ vmði; j � 1Þ

X
Jionði; jÞ ð6Þ
where Dt and Dx are the time (index i) and space (index j) discretization steps,
respectively, cm is the specific membrane capacitance, a is the cable radius, Ri is the
intracellular resistivity, and Jion ¼ JNa þ JK1 þ Jendo is the total ionic current density
(in pA cm � 2), calculated by dividing the total ionic current ðINa þ IK1 þ IendoÞ
from equation (1) with total membrane surface area. The Ri value was adopted to
simulate the mean CV measured in optically mapped monolayers of a monoclonal
HEK293 line expressing Kir2.1, Cx43 and NavSheP D60A. All simulations were
performed with the identical model parameters given in Supplementary Table 3
and distinct kinetic properties measured in different BacNav mutants (adjusted to
37 �C as described above).
The total length of the simulated cable was 0.72 cm (that is, 300 nodes). The first
three nodes in the cable were stimulated by current injection (1.2 � threshold) at
1 Hz rate and activation time at each node was determined as the time of maximum
upstroke velocity of propagated AP. Inverse slope of activation time versus distance
line fit in the central 0.24 cm of the cable was used to calculate CV.
Statistical analysis. All data are presented as mean±s.e.m. and statistical
significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey’s
post-hoc test to calculate P-values. Statistical significance was defined as ^Po0.05,
#Po0.01 and *Po0.0001.
