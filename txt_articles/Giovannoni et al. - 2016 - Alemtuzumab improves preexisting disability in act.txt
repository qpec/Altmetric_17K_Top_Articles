Alemtuzumab improves preexisting
disability in active relapsing-remitting MS
patients
ABSTRACT
Objective: To characterize effects of alemtuzumab treatment on measures of disability improve-
ment in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with inadequate response
($1 relapse) to prior therapy.
Methods: Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis (CARE-MS) II,
a 2-year randomized, rater-blinded, active-controlled, head-to-head, phase 3 trial, compared effi-
cacy and safety of alemtuzumab 12 mg with subcutaneous interferon-b-1a (SC IFN-b-1a) 44 mg
in patients with RRMS. Prespecified and post hoc disability outcomes based on Expanded Dis-
ability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), and Sloan low-
contrast letter acuity (SLCLA) are reported, focusing on improvement of preexisting disability
in addition to slowing of disability accumulation.
Results: Alemtuzumab-treated patients were more likely than SC IFN-b-1a–treated patients to
show improvement in EDSS scores (p , 0.0001) on all 7 functional systems. Significantly more
alemtuzumab patients demonstrated 6-month confirmed disability improvement. The likelihood of
improved vs stable/worsening MSFC scores was greater with alemtuzumab than SC IFN-b-1a
(p 5 0.0300); improvement in MSFC scores with alemtuzumab was primarily driven by the upper
limb coordination and dexterity domain. Alemtuzumab-treated patients had more favorable
changes from baseline in SLCLA (2.5% contrast) scores (p 5 0.0014) and MSFC 1 SLCLA
composite scores (p 5 0.0097) than SC IFN-b-1a–treated patients.
Conclusions: In patients with RRMS and inadequate response to prior disease-modifying thera-
pies, alemtuzumab provides greater benefits than SC IFN-b-1a across several disability out-
comes, reflecting improvement of preexisting disabilities.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class I evidence (based on rater blinding and a bal-
ance in baseline characteristics between arms) that alemtuzumab modifies disability measures
favorably compared with SC IFN-b-1a. Neurology® 2016;87:1985–1992

 standard for therapeutic efficacy than merely
slowing disability accumulation. Because dis-
ability is a primary contributor to the burden
of MS,8–10 restoring function in patients with
previously acquired neurologic impairments
may lead to improved long-term prognosis,
greater productivity and quality of life, and
reduced economic costs.
CDI is a metric reflecting durable and clini-
cally meaningful EDSS score changes. In the
phase 2 trial of alemtuzumab for RRMS
(CAMMS223; NCT00050778) and the phase
3 Comparison of Alemtuzumab and Rebif Effi-
cacy in Multiple Sclerosis II (CARE-MS II;
NCT00548405) trial, CDI was more likely
in alemtuzumab-treated patients than those
receiving subcutaneous interferon-b-1a (SC
IFN-b-1a).11,12 In CARE-MS II, alemtuzumab
was also associated with significantly greater
improvement in mean EDSS and Multiple
Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) scores
vs SC IFN-b-1a.12
The EDSS is an important tool in assessing
disability, but is heavily weighted toward
ambulation and relatively insensitive to other
aspects of disability.13,14 We therefore analyzed
disability using EDSS-based and non-EDSS-
based methods. The results of these prespeci-
fied outcomes and post hoc analyses from
CARE-MS II more fully characterize the effects
of alemtuzumab on disability in patients with
RRMS than those published previously,12 and
indicate potential for long-term improvement.
METHODS Patients and study design. Methods have been
published elsewhere.12 CARE-MS II was a 2-year, randomized,
rater-blinded, active comparator-controlled, head-to-head, trial of
alemtuzumab (Lemtrada; Sanofi Genzyme, Cambridge, MA; 12
mg/day on 5 consecutive days at month 0 and on 3 consecutive
days at month 12) vs SC IFN-b-1a (Rebif; EMD Serono,
Rockland, MA; 44 mg 3 times weekly) in patients with RRMS
with inadequate response to prior DMTs ($1 relapse during
IFN-b or glatiramer acetate [GA] treatment [received for $6
months]).12
Disability assessment procedures. Differences in study drug
administration and unique adverse event profiles precluded effec-
tive double-blinding. Blinded raters performed EDSS assessments
at baseline, every 3 months, and when relapse was suspected.
EDSS score changes of $1 point, confirmed over 3 or 6
months or longer, are accepted as clinically meaningful.15
Raters administered the MSFC16 3 times before baseline to
attenuate practice effects, then every 6 months. MSFC is a mul-
tidimensional instrument comprising quantitative tests of neuro-
logic performance in 3 critical domains: upper limb coordination
and dexterity (9-Hole Peg Test [9-HPT], raw score measured in
seconds); ambulation (25-Foot Timed Walking test, raw score
measured in seconds); and cognitive function (Paced Auditory
Serial Addition Test [PASAT]–3, raw score measured as number
of correct responses). MSFC component scores were standardized
by conversion into Z scores (SD units from mean population
baseline score) and averaged to a summary MSFC score; increased
MSFC scores indicate improvement.17 Changes from baseline of
$15% or $20% on $1 MSFC component score may be con-
sidered clinically meaningful.18
Visual function was assessed every 6 months using binocular
Sloan low-contrast letter acuity (SLCLA). Sloan charts display
alphabetic characters with various visual contrast differentials
(1.25%, 2.5%, and 100%, ranging from light gray to black);
scores represent the number of correctly identified letters (maxi-
mum 70). Increased or decreased SLCLA counts of $5 letters at
100% contrast, or $7 letters at 1.25% and 2.5% contrast, were
defined as clinically meaningful improvements or decrements,
respectively, as per prior MS studies.19 SLCLA was not assessed
at Russian and Ukrainian sites because Latin alphabetic characters
in Sloan charts may be unfamiliar in these countries. SLCLA was
normalized in the same manner as MSFC components. Patients
were also assessed using the 4-component, MSFC plus SLCLA
score incorporating Z scores from binocular, 1.25% contrast test-
ing.20 Previous work showed that 1.25% contrast provided the
greatest capacity to detect visual dysfunction in patients with MS
vs healthy controls.20
Endpoints. The following CARE-MS II tertiary endpoints were
assessed: time to CDI ($1.0-point EDSS decrease from baseline
sustained for $3 or $6 months, in patients with baseline score
$2.0); proportion worsened ($0.5-point increase), stable, or
improved ($0.5-point decrease) from baseline EDSS; mean
change from baseline in MSFC and MSFC plus SLCLA scores
and their components; and proportions worsened ($0.5 SD
decrease), stable, or improved ($0.5 SD increase) from baseline
MSFC scores.
Additional analyses included integrated disability score of area
under the curve (AUCSUM and AUCCHANGE as previously
described)21 for EDSS from quarterly visits over 2 years (considered
more sensitive than CDI Kaplan-Meier analysis)21 and odds ratios
(ORs) for improvement vs stability or worsening on individual
EDSS functional systems (visual [optic], brainstem, pyramidal, cer-
ebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder, and cerebral [mental]) from base-
line to month 24. To determine whether disability improvement
was confounded by recovery from recent relapse, we compared
mean EDSS change from baseline to month 6 in patients with
and without recent prestudy relapse (i.e., #3 months before first
study treatment). To determine dependence of disability improve-
ment on relapse suppression by alemtuzumab,22 we compared
mean EDSS change from baseline to month 6 in patients with
and without early on-study relapse (i.e., relapse [per protocol def-
inition] #6 months after first treatment).22 Risk of disability pro-
gression based on $20% or $15% changes from baseline on $1
MSFC component sustained for $6 months was also assessed.18,23
Statistical analyses. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to esti-
mate risk for 3-month CDI (post hoc analysis) and 6-month
CDI and risk for achieving specific ($20% or $15%) MSFC
improvement or worsening thresholds. Hazard ratios (HRs) and
p values were generated using proportional hazards regression
with covariate adjustment for geographic region and, for CDI
endpoints, stratification by baseline EDSS. Integrated disability
score of AUC for EDSS to 2 years (post hoc analysis) was
calculated using the trapezium rule with EDSS score at all
preplanned scheduled visits.21 EDSS AUC analysis used ranked

 analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models with baseline EDSS
and geographic region as covariates.
Changes from baseline on MSFC component Z scores,
overall MSFC score, and MSFC plus SLCLA scores were ana-
lyzed using the Wei-Lachin test and mixed model for repeated
measures analyses with time-by-treatment interaction and co-
variate adjustment for geographic region and baseline score.
The nonparametric Wei-Lachin multivariate test is used with
repeated measures data using change from baseline at different
timepoints to determine differences in score distribution over
time between treatment groups.24 SLCLA was analyzed by
ranked ANCOVA with covariate adjustment for geographic
region and baseline score. Proportional odds models with co-
variate adjustment for geographic region and baseline EDSS or
MSFC scores were used to analyze proportion worsened, stable,
or improved on EDSS and MSFC. Odds of improvement vs
stability or worsening on individual EDSS functional systems
were determined with covariate adjustment for geographic
region and baseline EDSS score.
Reported p values are nominal and not adjusted for multiple
comparisons.
Classification of evidence. This analysis examined whether
alemtuzumab treatment slows disability accumulation and im-
proves preexisting disability compared with SC IFN-b-1a in
patients with RRMS with an inadequate response to prior
therapy. The results represent Class I evidence because of several
elements of study design. Masked raters were used for study
assessments related to key efficacy endpoints (e.g., EDSS for
disability and relapse, MSFC, Sloan charts). Furthermore, ran-
domization was performed such that the baseline characteristics
were comparable between treatment arms.

RESULTS In total, 202 and 426 CARE-MS II
patients were randomized to SC IFN-b-1a 44 mg
and alemtuzumab 12 mg, respectively.12 Baseline
demographic and clinical characteristics were equivalent
between treatment groups, as previously reported.12
Percentage of patients with recent prestudy relapse was
also equivalent between groups (alemtuzumab, 32%; SC
IFN-b-1a, 33%).
EDSS-based disability outcomes. From baseline to
month 24, alemtuzumab patients were more likely
than SC IFN-b-1a patients to show EDSS improve-
ment (p , 0.0001; figure 1A). Odds of improvement
in all 7 EDSS functional systems were also greater for
alemtuzumab than SC IFN-b-1a (figure 1B), reach-
ing statistical significance in 5 domains (cerebral,
cerebellar, sensory, pyramidal, and visual).
Alemtuzumab patients were more than twice as
likely as SC IFN-b-1a patients to experience 3-month
CDI (34.7% vs 19.4%, p 5 0.0003 [HR 5 2.13]),
consistent with previously reported 6-month CDI data
(28.8% vs 12.9%, p 5 0.0002 [HR 5 2.57]; figure
2).12 Among patients with baseline EDSS $3.0, the
proportion of patients with 6-month CDI was also
significantly greater with alemtuzumab than SC IFN-
b-1a (35.4% vs 15.3%; p 5 0.0005 [HR 5 2.76]).
After stratification by presence or absence of prior IFN
use, 6-month CDI remained consistently more likely
with alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a both for patients
with prior IFN use (approximately 81% of patients
originally investigated in each of the 2 on-study treat-
ment arms, 28.4% vs 12.7%, p 5 0.0006 [HR 5
2.64]) and patients without prior IFN use (only around
19% of patients in each group, 30.5% vs 13.9%, p 5
0.0542 [HR 5 3.01]).
Alemtuzumab showed beneficial effect over SC IFN-
b-1a in integrated disability score AUCCHANGE (mean
[SD] 22.3 [18.45] vs 2.9 [16.84]; p 5 0.0016) and
AUCSUM analysis (62.8 [31.02] vs 64.8 [32.27]; p 5
0.0114).
Alemtuzumab patients had comparable mean
EDSS improvement from baseline to month 6 in

 cohorts with or without relapse within 3 months
before initiating treatment (mean change 20.1 in
both
relapse
groups),
indicating
that
disability
improvement did not merely reflect recovery from
recent relapse. SC IFN-b-1a patients experienced
worsened EDSS score from baseline to month 6
(mean change 10.21 and 10.14 in cohorts with or
without recent pretreatment relapse, respectively);
between-group differences were significant in both
cohorts (recent pretreatment relapse, p 5 0.0203;
no recent pretreatment relapse, p 5 0.0065).
Among patients without recent pretreatment
relapse, significantly greater proportions experienced
3-month (33.8% vs 15.2%, p 5 0.0004) and 6-
month CDI (28.8% vs 9.2%, p 5 0.0002) with
alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a over 24 months.
In patients with early on-study relapse, mean EDSS
scores increased from baseline to month 6 with both
treatments (alemtuzumab, 0.44; SC IFN-b-1a, 0.37;
difference 0.07; p 5 0.7243). Alemtuzumab-treated
patients without early on-study relapse had improved
6-month EDSS scores; SC IFN-b-1a–treated patients
showed worsening (difference 20.23; p 5 0.0041).
MSFC-based outcomes. The likelihood of 6-month
confirmed improvement in MSFC score from baseline
to month 24 was greater for alemtuzumab than SC
IFN-b-1a (OR [95% confidence interval] 1.80 [1.06,
3.08]; p 5 0.0300). SC IFN-b-1a patients were
significantly more likely than alemtuzumab patients to
experience worsening MSFC (sustained for 6 months)
at the $15% worsening threshold (27.58% vs 18.66%,
p 5 0.0143; figure 3A). At the $20% threshold, the
proportion who experienced worsening MSFC
was numerically higher with SC IFN-b-1a vs
alemtuzumab, but the difference was not statistically
significant (19.64% vs 13.48%, p 5 0.0606).
Among MSFC components (figure 3, B–D), the
greater benefit seen at month 24 with alemtuzumab
vs SC IFN-b-1a reached statistical significance for the
9-HPT (p 5 0.0007).
SLCLA-based outcomes. Alemtuzumab patients had
more favorable visual outcomes than those receiving
SC IFN-b-1a. Compared with baseline, visual acu-
ity in alemtuzumab patients was stable at 2.5%
contrast (month 12 change from baseline: 0.00;
month 24: 20.01; both p 5 not significant) and
at 100% contrast (month 12: 20.06; month 24:
20.04; both p 5 not significant). SC IFN-b-1a–
treated patients had a significant decline in visual
acuity from baseline to month 12 and from baseline
to month 24 at 1.25% contrast (month 12: 20.25;
month 24: 20.19; both p , 0.01) and 2.5% con-
trast (month 12: 20.20; month 24: 20.21; both
p , 0.001), and 100% contrast for month 24
(20.16; p 5 0.0105). Differences between treat-
ment groups were significant at 2.5% contrast
(month 12: p 5 0.0005; month 24: p 5 0.0014)
and at month 12 at 1.25% contrast (p 5 0.0005).
For MSFC plus SLCLA, alemtuzumab-treated
patients significantly improved from baseline to
month 12 (0.04 [p 5 0.0396]); the score at
month 24 increased from but did not differ from
baseline (0.04 [p 5 0.0787]). SC IFN-b-1a–treated
patients did not improve from baseline (month 12:
20.04 [p 5 0.1600]; month 24: 20.06 [p 5
0.0876]). The difference between treatment groups
was significant at month 12 and month 24 (both
p , 0.02; figure 3E).

 DISCUSSION Chronic disability plays a major role
in the disease burden of MS. Current treatments
may delay or prevent further increases in disability.
However, few data exist concerning the ability of cur-
rent treatments to help restore function over time in
patients with previously acquired neurologic impair-
ments,2,15 and there is a corresponding need for suit-
able metrics and analytic methods to reflect this novel
outcome. Alemtuzumab was more effective than SC
IFN-b-1a at improving disability outcomes, signifi-
cantly reducing the risk of 6-month CDW, and
increasing 6-month CDI.12 The clinical efficacy of
alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a was maintained
regardless of the type of prior DMTs (i.e., IFN-
b-1a, IFN-b-1b, or GA).12 The current analysis
demonstrates that, in patients with RRMS with an
inadequate response to prior DMTs, alemtuzumab
provides greater recovery of function across several

 disability measures than SC IFN-b-1a. The use of
this active comparator in the CARE-MS studies set
a high threshold for superiority compared with
placebo-controlled studies of other DMTs.
The findings of EDSS improvement from baseline
to month 24 in nearly half of the alemtuzumab-
treated patients, with improvements in all 7 EDSS
functional domains, suggest that such disabilities
may often be reversible (at least partially) in patients
with active RRMS if they receive suitable therapy,
irrespective of the type of baseline functional deficit.
Favorable disability outcomes were not directly attrib-
utable to relapse suppression since, in the absence of
early on-study relapse, EDSS scores improved in
alemtuzumab-treated patients but deteriorated in
those treated with SC IFN-b-1a. Alemtuzumab also
demonstrated significant improvements from baseline
vs SC IFN-b-1a in mean EDSS AUC; this measure is
less impacted than Kaplan-Meier analysis by transient
fluctuations in EDSS scores typically observed in pa-
tients with RRMS.21 Another approach reported here
is the relatively new outcome measure of CDI, which
we first defined in our post hoc analysis of the phase 2
CAMMS223 trial. Rather than utilizing group
means, CDI captures sustained and clinically mean-
ingful EDSS score changes in individual patients, and
thus has a simple clinical interpretation. By requiring
repeated confirmation of EDSS change, it is resistant
to
transient
fluctuations
compared
with
single-
timepoint analyses. Furthermore, this outcome only
includes patients who have at least minimal preexisting
neurologic impairment.11 Collectively, alemtuzumab-
associated functional recovery reflected in a variety of
EDSS-based measures represents an important, clini-
cally meaningful benefit beyond slowing or preventing
neurologic deterioration.
When assessing disability progression in MS, sen-
sitivity to change can be enhanced by combining dif-
ferent outcome measures.14 The EDSS is the most
familiar and commonly used neurologic disability
index in MS trials, but has been criticized for its
emphasis on ambulation and insensitivity to other
disability components (e.g., cognition), especially at
lower scores.13 The MSFC, which includes assess-
ment of cognition, was selected to supplement the
EDSS.16 From baseline to month 24, improvements
in MSFC and MSFC plus SLCLA scores were signif-
icantly greater with alemtuzumab vs SC IFN-b-1a.
Previously, MSFC worsening ($15% and $20%
worsening from baseline on at least one MSFC com-
ponent and sustained for $3 months) was shown to
correlate with EDSS, relapse rates, and some patient-
reported outcomes; 15% was the more sensitive
threshold to treatment effects.18 Alemtuzumab dem-
onstrated significant benefit over SC IFN-b-1a at the
15% threshold over $6 months. The effect of
alemtuzumab differed across MSFC component
scores; the strongest treatment effects were observed
on the 9-HPT, indicating that improvement in upper
limb function with alemtuzumab drove improvement
on the MSFC composite score.
The analyses supporting DMT-induced improve-
ment in preexisting disability reported here were pre-
specified and should be evaluated in the context of
other published trials. The present findings are consis-
tent with a post hoc analysis of CAMMS223,22 which
enrolled treatment-naive patients with RRMS. Im-
provements in preexisting disability were also reported
from placebo-controlled but not active-controlled trials
of natalizumab, and only using the 3-month-sustained
(not 6-month) criterion,15 and from a placebo-
controlled GA trial.2 In the present, active-controlled
study, CDI was achieved by significantly more
alemtuzumab-treated than SC IFN-b-1a–treated pa-
tients using either 3- or 6-month confirmed criteria.
The mechanisms underlying the greater observed
improvement in preexisting disability after alemtuzu-
mab are uncertain. Improvement does not reflect the
expected recovery from recent prestudy relapses.
Moreover, the finding that mean disability did not
improve with SC IFN-b-1a even among those who
had no clinically evident inflammatory activity on
study suggests that disability improvement after alem-
tuzumab is not fully explained by superior reduction
of inflammation. However, alemtuzumab’s more effi-
cacious inhibition of CNS inflammation may provide
a tissue environment that better supports endogenous
remyelination and repair mechanisms. Another pos-
sible
mechanism
involves
neurotrophic
factors
secreted by CNS-trafficking immune cells, which
have been postulated to contribute to neuroprotec-
tion and remyelination in MS.25,26 In one study,
immune cells repopulating after alemtuzumab treat-
ment for MS secreted neurotrophic factors, including
brain-derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary neuro-
trophic factor, after exposure to myelin basic protein
in vitro.22 Further studies are necessary to confirm
a role for neurotrophic mechanisms in the stabiliza-
tion or improvement in disability observed in
alemtuzumab-treated patients with MS.
Differences in timing, mode of administration,
and side effect profiles for alemtuzumab and SC
IFN-b-1a made a true double-blind design unfeasi-
ble, which may be considered a limitation of this
study. However, to minimize potential bias, key effi-
cacy assessments, including EDSS, MSFC, Sloan
charts, and on-study relapses, were performed by
trained evaluators blinded to treatment, and all sus-
pected relapses were adjudicated by an independent,
blinded relapse adjudication panel.

 SC IFN-b-1a on disability outcomes should be con-
sidered in the context of the risks, including infusion-
associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune
adverse events.12,27 Measures to manage these poten-
tially serious risks are essential for the safe use of
alemtuzumab.
The outcomes presented here not only support
alemtuzumab’s ability to slow disability accumula-
tion, but also demonstrate superior benefit in improv-
ing preexisting disability in patients with RRMS with
an inadequate response to prior DMT. These data
add to the body of evidence supporting a favorable
benefit-risk profile of alemtuzumab in the treatment
of RRMS.
