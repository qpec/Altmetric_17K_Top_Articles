IMPORTANCE Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who receive dialysis are at high
risk of lower extremity amputation. Recent studies indicate decreasing rates of lower
extremity amputation in non-ESRD populations, but contemporary data for patients with
ESRD who receive dialysis are lacking.
OBJECTIVES To assess rates of lower extremity amputation among patients with ESRD who
receive dialysis during a recent 15-year period; to analyze whether those rates differed by age,
sex, diabetes, or geographic region; and to determine 1-year mortality rates in this population
after lower extremity amputation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective study of 3 700 902 records obtained
from a US national registry of patients with ESRD who receive dialysis assessed
cross-sectional cohorts for each calendar year from 2000 through 2014. Adult patients with
prevalent ESRD treated with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis covered by Medicare Part A
and B on January 1 of each cohort year were included. Data analysis was conducted from
August 2017 to April 2018.
EXPOSURES Age, sex, diabetes, and hospital referral region.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual rates per 100 person-years of nontraumatic major
(above- or below-knee) and minor (below-ankle) amputations.
RESULTS For each annual cohort, there were fewer women (47.5% in 2000, 46.2% in 2005,
44.9% in 2010, and 44.0% in 2014) than men, more than half the patients were white
individuals (58.1% in 2000, 56.9% in 2005, 56.9% in 2010, and 56.7% in 2014), and a small
proportion were employed (13.9% in 2000, 15.1% in 2005, 16.1% in 2010, and 16.5% in 2014).
The rate of lower extremity amputations for patients with ESRD who receive dialysis
decreased by 51.0% from 2000 to 2014, driven primarily by a decrease in the rate of major
amputations (5.42 [95% CI, 5.28-5.56] in 2000 vs 2.66 [95% CI, 2.59-2.72] per 100
person-years in 2014). Patients with diabetes had amputation rates more than 5 times as high
as patients without diabetes. Patients younger than 65 years had higher adjusted amputation
rates than older patients, and men had consistently higher adjusted amputation rates than
women. Adjusted 1-year mortality rates after lower extremity amputation for patients with
ESRD who receive dialysis decreased from 52.2% (95% CI, 50.9%-53.4%) in 2000 to 43.6%
(95% CI, 42.5%-44.8%) in 2013. In general, amputation rates decreased among all regions
from 2000 to 2014, but regional variability persisted across time despite adjustment for
differences in patient demographics and comorbid conditions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although rates of lower extremity amputations among
US patients with ESRD who receive dialysis decreased by 51% during a recent 15-year period,
mortality rates remained high, with nearly half of patients dying within a year after lower
extremity amputation. Our results highlight the need for more research on ways to prevent
lower extremity amputation in this extremely high-risk population.

 P
eripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects approximately
8.5 million persons in the United States, with an an-
nual incidence rate of 2.8% and prevalence rate of
12.3%.1 Patients with the most severe forms of PAD require
lower extremity amputation, and the aftermath can be
devastating.2Patientswithend-stagerenaldisease(ESRD)who
receivedialysisareatespeciallyhighriskofamputation,3-7per-
haps due in part to the high prevalence of traditional risk
factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, and of ESRD-
specific risk factors, such as chronic inflammation and
uremia.8-10 Initiation of dialysis is also an independent risk
factor for amputation.5-7
An analysis of the general Medicare population showed
a 45% decrease in lower extremity amputation rates from
1996 to 2011.11 Commonly cited reasons for this improve-
ment include better PAD screening and vascular care, espe-
cially for patients with diabetes.2,11 Whether there has been a
similar improvement in rates of lower extremity amputation
for patients with ESRD who receive dialysis is unknown
because the rates in this population were last described
nearly 2 decades ago.12
Thus, we used the national ESRD registry to evaluate the
2000 to 2014 rates of lower extremity amputation for pa-
tients with ESRD who receive dialysis and whether those rates
were associated with patient characteristics or comorbidi-
ties. We also examined regional variation in amputation prac-
tice patterns and 1-year mortality rates after lower extremity
amputation.
Methods
Study Population
We used the US Renal Data System (USRDS), a national data
system that collects, analyzes, and distributes information
about ESRD in the United States.13 Data were gathered from
the USRDS for all patients initiating hemodialysis or perito-
neal dialysis between January 1, 1996, and October 1, 2014. We
generated annual cross-sectional populations of patients with
prevalent ESRD who receive dialysis and are covered by Medi-
care (Parts A and B) on the first day of January for each calen-
daryearfrom2000to2014,creating15annualcohorts.Welim-
itedthecohortstopatientsinitiatingdialysisonorafterJanuary
1, 1996, because the Medical Evidence Report form CMS 2728
that we used to ascertain comorbid conditions is completed
within 45 days of incident ESRD, but this form was not re-
quired until 1995. Owing to the accrual of prevalent patients
with time, the size of each annual cohort progressively in-
creased, as did the time after initiation of dialysis (ie, dialysis
vintage; Table 1). Patients were excluded if they were younger
than 18 years or older than 110 years of age at incident ESRD,
if their CMS 2728 form was missing or filed more than 45 days
after initiation of dialysis, or if data for sex or race were miss-
ing. We also excluded patients who recovered kidney func-
tion within 365 days of dialysis initiation. The institutional re-
view board of Stanford University School of Medicine (Palo
Alto,California)approvedthisstudyanddeemedthattheneed
for patient consent could be waived because the data were de-
identified and a waiver would not adversely affect the rights
and welfare of the participants.
Covariates
We collected information from the USRDS patient and treat-
ment history files on age, sex, race (white, black, Asian, Na-
tive American, or other), Hispanic ethnicity, Medicaid eligi-
bility, employment status, presumed cause of ESRD (diabetes,
hypertension, glomerulonephritis, or other), dialysis modal-
ity, dialysis vintage, and year of dialysis initiation. Informa-
tion was collected from the Medical Evidence Report on co-
morbid conditions, which were selected a priori given their
associations with lower extremity amputations in ESRD and
included PAD, heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabe-
tes, hypertension, other heart disease (including arrhyth-
mias and pericarditis), cerebrovascular disease, and current
smoking.8 Some of the comorbidity category names in the
Medical Evidence Report changed from the 1995 version to the
2005 version and were thus renamed as necessary (eTable 1
in the Supplement). For example, cardiac failure on the 1995
form was changed to congestive heart failure on the 2005 form,
and both were categorized as heart failure in our analysis. We
also collected residence location by hospital referral region on
January 1 of each cohort year to evaluate the regional varia-
tion in amputation rates.14
Outcomes
The primary outcome of interest was the number of lower
extremity amputations per 100 patient-years for each cohort
year, identified using International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Edition (ICD-9) procedure codes and Current Proce-
dural Terminology, 4th Revision (CPT-4) codes (eTable 2 in
the Supplement). Amputations were categorized as major
(above- or below-knee) or minor (below-ankle). Amputations
occurring during the same encounter as one with diagnosis
codes for trauma, congenital or acquired deformities, or
malignant neoplasms were excluded. To prevent amputation
event rate overestimation due to planned multiple-step
procedures that may occur across weeks or months, we
included only the highest-level amputation per patient per
calendar year, as has been previously done.15 Thus, our
results for the number of amputations per year were likely a
conservative estimate.
Key Points
Question Have rates of lower extremity amputation among
patients with end-stage renal disease who receive dialysis changed
in a recent 15-year period?
Findings This study assessing more than 3 million records in
a US national end-stage renal disease registry found that rates of
lower extremity amputation decreased from 5.4 to 2.7 per 100
person-years from 2000 to 2014. Among patients who had an
amputation, nearly half died the following year.
Meaning Despite improvements, patients with end-stage renal
disease who receive dialysis continue to display high rates of lower
extremity amputation and postamputation 1-year mortality.

 follow-up for all cohorts. One-year mortality was defined as
death within 365 days of the first date of the highest-level am-
putation for the cohort year.
Statistical Analysis
To assess whether the rate of lower extremity amputation
changed with time, we used a log Poisson generalized linear
model with robust standard errors to model the number of pa-
tients with amputations per 100 person-years for each cohort
year. Exposure time began on January 1 of the cohort year and
endedwiththefirstofthefollowingevents:death,lossofMedi-
care dual eligibility, or December 31 of cohort year. Models in-
cluded an offset term with log exposure time. We adjusted for
the following variables: age, race, ethnicity, employment sta-
tus, Medicaid dual eligibility, cause of ESRD, dialysis modal-
ity, dialysis vintage, congestive heart failure, coronary artery
disease, other heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, PAD, hy-
pertension, diabetes, and current smoking.8 We then calcu-
lated adjusted rates, rate ratios, and their 95% CIs for each co-
hort year using the first cohort year (2000) as a reference.
Unadjusted and adjusted amputation rates were calculated
overall and by level of amputation. We also examined differ-
ences in amputation rates by diabetes status (defined as hav-
ingdiabetesasacauseofESRD,acomorbidcondition,orboth),
age (<65 years or â¥65 years), and sex. Amputation rates among
patients without diabetes or hypertension (defined as having
hypertensionasacauseofESRD,acomorbidcondition,orboth)
were also assessed. We tested for effect modification of the lin-
ear trend with time by diabetes, age, or sex using a linear re-
gression model applied directly to the estimated rates.
To evaluate regional variation, we examined amputation
ratesbyhospitalreferralregion,comparingunadjustedandad-
justed data to determine if the variation could be explained by
factors previously shown to increase risk of lower extremity
amputation.
We examined trends in lower extremity revasculariza-
tion procedures using models analogous to those used for ex-
amining trends in lower extremity amputation.
To estimate 1-year mortality after lower extremity ampu-
tation for each cohort year from 2000 through 2013, we ad-
justed for the same factors as those used in the lower extrem-
ity amputation model and performed a subanalysis by
amputation level.
In modeling the primary outcome, we had 3 702 395 total
observations with less than 0.1% of the data missing. Thus, we
conducted a complete case analysis using 3 700 902 records.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS for Win-
dows, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) and Stata/MP, version 13.1
(StataCorp). A 2-sided P < .05 was considered statistically
significant. Data analysis was conducted from August 2017 to
April 2018.
Results
In each annual cohort, there were fewer women (47.5% in
2000, 46.2% in 2005, 44.9% in 2010, and 44.0% in 2014) than
men, more than half of the patients were white individuals
(58.1% in 2000, 56.9% in 2005, 56.9% in 2010, and 56.7% in
2014), and a relatively small proportion were employed (13.9%
in 2000, 15.1% in 2005, 16.1% in 2010, and 16.5% in 2014)
(Table 1). The proportion of patients with diabetes and hyper-
tension increased with time, whereas the proportion of pa-
tients with coronary artery disease and recognized PAD de-
creased with time.
Trends in Amputation Rates
The adjusted rate of all lower extremity amputations de-
creased from 5.42 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 5.28-5.56) in
2000 to 2.66 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 2.59-2.72) in 2014
(Figure 1; eTable 3 in the Supplement), a relative decrease of
51.0%. The adjusted rate of above-knee amputations de-
creased by 65.0% and the adjusted rate of below-knee ampu-
tationsdecreasedby58.5%,whereastheadjustedrateofbelow-
ankleamputationsdecreasedbyonly25.9%from2000to2014.
The adjusted rate of any lower extremity revasculariza-
tion procedure decreased during the study period from 1.63
per 100 person-years (95% CI, 1.55-1.71) in 2000 to 1.28 per 100
person-years (95% CI, 1.24-1.33) in 2014, a decrease of 21.5%
(eFigure, eTable 4 in the Supplement). The adjusted rates of
surgical bypass decreased by 56.4% (95% CI, 52.5%-60.0%),
whereas the adjusted rate of endovascular revascularization
increased by 37.0% (95% CI, 25.5%-49.7%).
Amputation Rates by Diabetes, Age, Sex,
and Hospital Referral Region
During the study period, the adjusted amputation rate for pa-
tients with diabetes decreased by 52.8% from 8.65 per 100 per-
son-years (95% CI, 8.41-8.88) in 2000 to 4.09 per 100 person-
years(95%CI,3.99-4.19)in2014;forpatientswithoutdiabetes,
the rate decreased by 48.0% from 1.43 per 100 person-years

tients with diabetes remained more than 5 times as high as

(Figure 2B; eTable 6 in the Supplement). However, with time,
the adjusted amputation rates decreased less rapidly for pa-
tients who were younger than 65 years than for patients who
were 65 years or older (eg, 2014 rates were 2.92 [95% CI, 2.84-

One-Year Mortality Rates After Lower Extremity Amputation
Adjusted 1-year mortality rates after lower extremity ampu-
tation for patients who receive dialysis decreased by 17% (95%
CI, 14%-20%) during the study period from 52.2% (95% CI,
50.9%-53.4%)in2000to43.6%(95%CI,42.5%-44.8%)in2013
(Table 2).
Discussion
The rates of lower extremity amputations for patients with
ESRD who receive dialysis decreased by 51.0% from 2000 to
2014, driven primarily by a decrease in the rate of major am-
putations: above-knee amputations decreased by 65.0% and
below-knee amputations by 58.5% during the study period.
ThisdecreaseintheamputationrateamongpatientswithESRD
contrasts with the 69% increase in the amputation rate ob-
served from 1991 to 199412 and mirrors the decreasing trend
in amputations, which was also driven by a decrease in major
amputationsreportedforthegeneralMedicarepopulationfrom
1996 to 2011.11
The reasons for the declining amputation rate cannot be
directly gleaned from our observational analysis. We postu-
late that 1 factor may be more aggressive cardiovascular risk
factor management given the declining prevalence of coro-
nary artery disease and of recognized PAD observed during the
study period. Improvement in foot care among patients with
diabetes11 is another potential contributor; for example, in 1
large dialysis organization, implementation of monthly foot
checks was associated with a 17% decrease in amputation
rates.19 Although a study of patients with Medicare without

 ESRD showed a temporal increase in lower extremity revas-
cularization procedures coincident with decreasing amputa-
tion rates,11 our study of patients with ESRD indicated a slight
decline in rates of lower extremity revascularization during
the study period.
Althoughthelargedecreaseinratesoflowerextremityam-
putation among patients with ESRD is encouraging, absolute
amputation rates remained high when compared with re-
ported rates in the general Medicare population. For ex-
ample, in 2011, the amputation rate was more than 20-fold
higher among patients with ESRD in our study compared with
the general non-ESRD Medicare population (2.88 vs 0.12 per
100 person-years).11 Even in the relatively healthier subgroup
of patients with ESRD without diabetes or hypertension, am-
putation rates remained markedly elevated (eg, amputation
rate of 0.58 per 100 person-years in 2011). The amputation rate
among patients with ESRD in our analysis (mean age, 63 years)
more closely match the amputation rates reported in a very
high-risk, non-ESRD patient population (ie, Medicare benefi-
ciaries [mean age, 78 years] with recognized PAD),20 with an
amputation rate of 5.79 per 100 patients in 2008. Moreover,
1-year mortality rates after lower extremity amputation, al-
though also decreased, remained high during our study pe-
riod: 52.2% in 2000 and 43.6% in 2013. Thus, although the dis-
proportionately high amputation rate among patients with
ESRD can be partially explained by the high prevalence of tra-
ditional risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, ESRD-
specific factors, such as aggressive vascular calcification, in-
flammation, and uremia or even the dialysis procedure itself,
mayalsocontribute.5-10Futurestudiesfocusedonunderstand-
ing the ESRD-specific mechanisms leading to lower extrem-
ity amputation are needed.
Certain patient subgroups had higher amputation rates
than others. For example, the presence of diabetes conferred
an amputation rate 5 times as high as that for patients with-
out this condition, and men had higher rates of amputation
than women throughout the study period. These results are
consistent with previous studies showing that diabetes and
male sex are significant risk factors for amputation in the non-
ESRD population.8,10,21,22 We also found an increasing differ-
ence across the study period in amputation rates among pa-
tients younger than 65 years and those 65 years or older, with
younger patients having higher amputation rates starting in
2005. Although older age is a known risk factor for PAD among
patients without ESRD,1,22 the same may not be true for pa-
tients who receive dialysis.8,10 In a study evaluating amputa-
tiontrendsamongpatientswithESRDfrom1991through1994,
the peak amputation rate occurred between 45 and 54 years
of age for patients with diabetes and between 55 and 64 years
of age for patients without diabetes.12 Similarly, an interna-
tional study of 29 838 patients receiving hemodialysis in the
Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study found that pa-
tients 65 to 74 years of age and those 75 years or older had sig-
nificantlyloweroddsofamputationthanpatients55to64years
of age.23 All of these results are consistent with reports that
patientswithESRDwhoreceivedialysistendtoexperiencepre-
mature vascular aging,24,25 which may contribute to more ad-
vanced PAD and hence higher rates of lower extremity ampu-
tation at a younger age. Alternatively, these results could also
reflect the possibility that older patients who receive dialysis
(or their physicians) may be more reluctant than younger pa-
tients to pursue amputation.
Amputation rates decreased across nearly all hospital re-
ferral regions from 2000 through 2014 but remained higher
in the South and Northeast regions of the United States than
in the West and Midwest regions. These regional differences
persisted even after adjustment for differences in demograph-
ics, such as age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, and
for differences in comorbid conditions, such as diabetes. Our
results are consistent with other studies that have shown sig-

 nificant regional variation in amputation rates among other
populations. The persistent regional variation could stem from
differences not captured in our analysis, such as in intensity
of vascular care,14 differences in surgical practice patterns, un-
captured socioeconomic variables, or structural differences in
the health care system management of PAD or diabetes. Fur-
ther studies aimed at better understanding factors contribut-
ing to regional variation are warranted.
Limitations
Our study had several limitations. First, we were unable to de-
terminelateralityofamputationfrombillingclaims,whichpre-
cluded our ability to accurately determine whether a patient
may have undergone multiple amputations vs multiple-stage
procedures in the same calendar year. To avoid overestimat-
ing amputation rates, we counted only the highest-level
amputation per year. Our results, therefore, are likely a con-
servative estimate of the true amputation rates. Second, we
relied on the Medical Evidence Report, which generally has
high specificity but low sensitivity, to ascertain comorbid
conditions,26,27 thus resulting in underascertainment of co-
morbid conditions. This issue could potentially explain the
lowerprevalencesofheartfailure,coronaryarterydisease,PAD,
and current smoking observed in the present study com-
pared with those reported in other analyses.28,29 However, this
issue would not be expected to substantially change our find-
ings of persistently high amputation rates in ESRD. Finally,
our analysis was limited to patients with ESRD who receive di-
alysis and who had Medicare Parts A and B as primary payer
and thus may not be generalizable to patients who are pri-
vately insured.
Conclusions
We showed that patients with ESRD who receive dialysis had
significant improvements in the rates of lower extremity am-
putation during the period from 2000 to 2014. However, am-
putation rates remained markedly higher than rates reported
in the general Medicare population, and nearly half of all pa-
tients with ESRD who had undergone lower extremity ampu-
tation died within the first year after the procedure. Patients
withESRDanddiabeteshadparticularlyhighamputationrates.
We also found considerable regional variation in rates of lower
extremity amputation that could not be fully explained by dif-
ferencesinpatientdemographics,socioeconomicstatus,orco-
morbid conditions. Our results highlight the need for more re-
search on ways to prevent lower extremity amputation in this
extremely high-risk population.
