or all candidates waiting for a solid-organ transplant, the 
lack of suitable deceased donors has led to waiting-list 
deaths, with mortality rates dependent upon organ type. 
As a result, donation criteria have been expanded in an effort to 
increase the deceased-donor pool for all organs.1 Initially, efforts 
focused on accepting organs from increasingly older donors.1,2 
Surgical techniques have also evolved, allowing a single dona-
tion to provide life-saving transplants to multiple recipients, 
through so-called split-organ transplants.3 More recently, the 
development of ex vivo organ perfusion systems has permitted 
evaluation, resuscitation and ultimately successful use of mar-
ginal organs previously considered unsuitable for transplant.4
The most important development in efforts to expand the 
donor pool has involved donation after circulatory determination 
of death (DCD).5 In these cases, life-sustaining therapy is with-
drawn and organs are recovered after death is declared by 
absence of circulation. In contrast, traditional organ recovery fol-
lows neurologic determination of death (NDD) by standardized 
criteria, in the setting of intact circulation. DCD has gained prom-
inence with availability of improved techniques for preservation 
of organs with prolonged ischemia after circulation stops. Ini-
tially reported for kidney recipients, successful transplants from 
DCD donors have now been performed with lung, liver and, most 
recently, heart.6–10
In the setting of this advance in organ donation, concerns 
have been raised about the quality and yield of organs from DCD 
and about whether an active DCD program replaces organs that 
would otherwise have been procured through NDD donation.11,12

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: To increase the available 
pool of organ donors, Ontario intro-
duced donation after circulatory deter-
mination of death (DCD) in 2006. Other 
jurisdictions have reported a decrease 
in donations involving neurologic deter-
mination of death (NDD) after imple-
mentation of DCD, with a drop in organ 
yield and quality. In this study, we 
examined the effect of DCD on overall 
transplant activity in Ontario. 
METHODS: We examined deceased donor 
and organ transplant activity during 
3 distinct 4-year eras: pre-DCD (2002/03 
to 2005/06), early DCD (2006/07 to 
2009/10) and recent DCD (2010/11 to 
2013/14). We compared these donor 
groups by categorical characteristics.  
RESULTS: Donation increased by 57%, 
from 578 donors in the pre-DCD era to 
905 donors in the recent DCD era, with a 
21% proportion (190/905) of DCD 
donors in the recent DCD era. However, 
overall NDD donation also increased. 
The mean length of hospital stay before 
declaration for NDD was 2.7 days versus 
6.0 days before withdrawal of life sup-
port and subsequent asystole in cases 
of DCD. The average organ yield was 
3.73 with NDD donation versus 2.58 
with DCD (p < 0.001). Apart from hearts, 
all organs from DCD donors were suc-
cessfully transplanted. From the pre-
DCD era to the recent DCD era, trans-
plant activity in each era increased for 
all solid-organ recipients, including 
heart (from 158 to 216), kidney (from 
821 to 1321), liver (from 477 to 657) and 
lung (from 160 to 305).
INTERPRETATION: Implementation of 
DCD in Ontario led to increased trans-
plant activity for all solid-organ recipi-
ents. There was no evidence that the 
use of DCD was pre-empting potential 
NDD donation. In contrast to groups 
receiving other organs, heart trans-
plant candidates have not yet bene-
fited from DCD.

Since 2002, Ontario (Canada’s most populous province) has 
been served by a single organ procurement agency, the Trillium 
Gift of Life Network (www.giftoflife.on.ca). This network 
launched a DCD program in 2006, with uptake in most large ter-
tiary centres by 2010. The Trillium Gift of Life Network prospec-
tively tracks all donor and transplant activity in the province, 
which allows assessment of the introduction of the DCD program 
on overall organ yield and transplant numbers. 
In this study, we compared transplant activity in 3 distinct 
eras (pre-DCD, early DCD and more recently, when DCD activity 
has matured) in an attempt to answer the following fundamental 
questions: Did the introduction of DCD adversely affect potential 
NDD donation and the overall number of organ donors and trans-
plants? Does DCD yield the same number of organs as traditional 
NDD donation?
Methods
All patients listed for solid-organ transplant in the province of 
Ontario are registered with the Trillium Gift of Life Network. The 
network is also responsible for accepting referrals for potential 
organ donors, and it tracks and records all organ procurement in 
the province. We compared donor and transplant data from 
3 distinct 4-year eras: pre-DCD (2002/03 to 2005/06), early DCD 
(2006/07 to 2009/10) and recent DCD (2010/11 to 2013/14) (with 
fiscal years beginning in April and ending in March).  
To determine whether DCD activity influenced NDD activity, 
we examined the cause of death for each donor group and the 
time from hospital admission to declaration of death for each 
organ donor. We hypothesized that if DCD was pre-empting 
potential NDD donation, the time from admission to declara-
tion of death would be shorter in the DCD group. We also 
studied the number of organs transplanted from NDD and DCD 
donors.
Statistical analysis
Categorical data were compared by the χ2 or Fisher exact test, as 
appropriate. To examine the simultaneous effect of year and 
donation group, we employed a 2-sample t test. 
Ethics approval
This study involved de-identified data collected by a provincial 
agency, and every transplant hospital in Ontario is mandated to pro-
vide these data to the Trillium Gift of Life Network. As such, approval 
of a research ethics board was not required to either receive the 
data or publish them. The study was approved by the medical direc-
tor of research of the Trillium Gift of Life Network (S.D.).
Results
Overall organ donation
During the overall study period (April 2002 to March 2014), the total 
number of organ donors increased from 132 to 223 per year, with a 
cumulative total of 2258 deceased donors and 6763 deceased-donor 
transplants. There were more organ donors for each successive era: 
578 in the pre-DCD era, 775 in the early DCD era and 905 in the 
recent DCD era. Figure 1 shows this growth in organ donation, as 
well as the increasing proportion of DCD donors over the 3 succes-
sive eras, with DCD accounting for 21% (190/905) of overall donor 
activity in the most recent era, ending in March 2014. Although the 
proportion of DCD donors increased from 2002 to 2014, a statistical 
analysis limited to eras 2 and 3 showed no significant change by 
year, because most organs still originated from NDD donors (p = 0.1). 
On average, the yield from each NDD donor was 3.73 organs, 
whereas the yield from each DCD donor was 2.58 organs (p < 0.001) 
(Table 1). The average organ yield from a DCD donor declined from 
2.67 in the early DCD era to 2.30 in the recent DCD era (p = 0.3).  
Donor characteristics
Overall, NDD donors were older than DCD donors (47 v. 41 years, 
p < 0.001). Table 2 shows the donor cause of death in the NDD and 
DCD groups. For NDD donors, cerebrovascular accident or stroke 
was the most common cause of death, and there was a striking 
increase in the proportion of deaths from anoxia in the most 
recent era. In contrast, for DCD donors, anoxia has emerged as the 
most common cause of death. Over time, the overall number of 
donors with anoxic brain death has increased (p < 0.001). 
Figure 2 shows the times from donor admission to hospital to 
the declaration of death. For most NDD donors (1268/1709 
[74%]), death was declared within 3 days of hospital admission 
(mean 2.7 d, standard deviation [SD] 3.3 d, range 0–48 d). In con-
trast, DCD donors were admitted for an average of 6.0 (SD 5.2) 
days before withdrawal of life support and subsequent asystole 
(range 0–49 d, p < 0.001). 
Organ transplants
Table 1 shows the donor rate per 100 000 population over the study 
period, and Figure 3 provides organ-specific transplant rates for 
NDD and DCD donors. The overall increase in the number of trans-
plants from 2006 to 2014 is almost entirely due to the growth in DCD 
transplants. There was also an increase in the number of transplants

from NDD donors over time. There was modest growth in all solid-
organ transplants from NDD donors, with a large increase in the 
number of kidney transplants from DCD donors. Figure 3C shows 
organ-specific transplants from all donors and confirms that the 
growth in kidney transplants from DCD donors did not come at the 
expense of other organs. More specifically, from the pre-DCD era to 
the recent DCD era, transplant activity in each era increased for all 
solid-organ recipients, including heart (from 158 to 216), kidney 
(from 821 to 1321), liver (from 477 to 657) and lung (from 160 to 305).
Interpretation
Donation after circulatory determination of death was intro-
duced in Ontario in 2006. Certain organ transplant groups, par-
ticularly those involved in renal transplant, saw DCD as a 
potential means to substantially increase the donor pool; 
others, such as the cardiac transplant groups, feared that the 
expansion of DCD would come at the expense of traditional 
NDD transplants. Combined with the previously documented 
lower organ yield from DCD, there was a legitimate concern 
that overall transplant numbers would be adversely 
affected.11,12 In the current study, we have shown that NDD 
donation did not decline in Ontario, despite a substantial 
increase in DCD over 3 eras. Ontario now enjoys one of the high-
est rates of DCD in North America.12
In jurisdictions such as the United States, where different 
organ procurement agencies may have overlapping geographic 
territories, it may be difficult to assess accurately the effects of 
introducing new donation practices. In contrast, the Trillium Gift 
of Life Network in Ontario (which has a population of 13 million)

oversees all donation and transplant activity within the province. 
Therefore, this network has a greater ability to assess the effect 
of a new donor procurement strategy.
An analysis of the donor characteristics shown in Table 2 and 
Table 3 suggests that DCD donors are distinct from traditional 
NDD donors. NDD donors were more likely to have experienced 
an embolic or hemorrhagic neurologic event, whereas DCD 
donors were more likely to have experienced anoxic brain injury. 
Of importance, the mean length of stay before declaration of 
death was 2.7 days for NDD donors versus 6.0 days to with-
drawal of life support and asystole in DCD donors. Thus, death 
was being declared for potential DCD donors well after the time 
window for potential NDD donation, with little overlap. This 
result contradicts a widely held notion that organs are re-
covered from DCD donors before they become eligible for tradi-
tional NDD donation.

Our data clearly support previous reports that 
overall yield from DCD donors is less than that 
from NDD donors. At present, this is likely because 
hearts are not currently procured from DCD 
donors; however, the introduction of ex vivo per-
fusion strategies and the successful use of DCD 
hearts in other jurisdictions may result in equal-
ization of the organ yields between donor 
groups.10 The largest overall growth in transplants 
was for kidneys. Similarly, kidneys had the most 
substantial increase in DCD transplants. In con-
trast, growth in heart transplants has been mod-
est, but, importantly, the number of heart trans-
plants did grow over time, which suggests that 
DCD has not negatively affected transplants of 
this organ. Important advances in heart trans-
plant after DCD have occurred elsewhere,10 and 
this work should be replicated in North America. 
Perhaps more relevant to the cardiac transplant 
groups is the continued development of mechan-
ical assist devices, which are increasingly being 
offered as an alternative to transplant.13 The intro-
duction of ex vivo perfusion technologies has 
affected the number of DCD lung transplants, and 
we suspect that the same will occur with heart 
transplants once ex vivo cardiac perfusion 
becomes widely available.9,14
An unanswered question from this study 
relates to the quality of the organs from DCD and 
NDD donors. Wadei and associates11,14 and Orman 
and colleagues12 reported that use of both renal 
and liver grafts from DCD donors led to inferior 
outcomes relative to NDD donors. We have previ-
ously reported on transplant outcomes after the 
first 3 years of the Ontario DCD experience,15 and 
found that recipients of organs from DCD donors 
had survival similar to that of recipients of organs 
from NDD donors. The current study did not 
examine post-transplant outcomes, but was pri-
marily designed to look at donation activity and 
the potential effects of DCD on NDD activity. 
Although organ quality is an important consider-
ation, it must be evaluated in the context of 
expansion of the overall donor pool, much as has 
occurred with the use of “extended criteria” 
organs from donors with advanced age or other 
relative contraindications to donation.1,2
Limitations
It is difficult to speculate on what the growth rate 
of NDD donation would have been in the absence 
of DCD. We concede that this study is observa-
tional in nature and that we cannot ascribe cau-
sality to the changes observed. Nonetheless, we 
believe that these results show that overall NDD 
activity did not suffer from the introduction of a

DCD program (in contrast to other reports in the literature7,8,12). It 
is unlikely (given historical rates) that growth in NDD donation 
would have matched or exceeded that of DCD. Our data also sug-
gest that DCD donors are unlikely to transition to conventional 
NDD donors; thus, the introduction of DCD has had the intended 
effect of expanding the donor pool and increasing overall trans-
plant activity, without adversely affecting NDD donation. 
Other initiatives may have simultaneously increased NDD 
donation, thus negating any potential identifiable loss caused by 
DCD practice. These initiatives include the introduction of donor 
physicians, improved donor referral policies and the introduction 
of extended donor criteria. Our study could not take into account 
changes in health policy or access to care that may have influ-
enced donor and transplant activity during the period of our 
study. However, it is likely that any initiative, including promo-
tion of DCD, would benefit both DCD and NDD donation equally.
Our study reflects transplant activity in a single jurisdiction, 
and the results may not be generalizable to other regions. Relative 
rates of donation and transplant in different jurisdictions are 
multi 
factorial and can be difficult to compare. Our focus on 
Ontario was necessary to ensure homogeneity of the data. How-
ever, other regions in Canada and the US should be able to use our 
findings to reflect on their own inherent assumptions toward DCD.
Conclusion
Donation after circulatory determination of death has had a posi-
tive effect in Ontario in terms of both overall number of donors and 
transplant activity. Donation after NDD does not appear to have 
been adversely affected. Although there are disparities among 
organ groups, we foresee that an active DCD program will continue 
to have a positive effect for all solid-organ transplant recipients.
Future work is needed to investigate why NDD rates continue 
to increase and also to investigate reasons for the success of DCD. 
Further investigation is also needed to identify why death is 
declared earlier for NDD donors than for DCD donors and to deter-
mine the important factors involved with neuro 
prognostication 
before DCD is considered.
