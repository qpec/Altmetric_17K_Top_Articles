The relation between cesarean 
birth and child cognitive 
development

This is the first detailed study of the relation between cesarean birth and child cognitive development. 
We measure differences in child cognitive performance at 4 to 9 years of age between cesarean-born 
and vaginally-born children (n = 3,666) participating in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children 
(LSAC). LSAC is a nationally representative birth cohort surveyed biennially. Using multivariate 
regression, we control for a large range of confounders related to perinatal risk factors and the socio-
economic advantage associated with cesarean-born children. Across several measures, we find that 
cesarean-born children perform significantly below vaginally-born children, by up to a tenth of a 
standard deviation in national numeracy test scores at age 8–9. Estimates from a low-risk sub-sample 
and lower-bound analysis suggest that the relation is not spuriously related to unobserved confounding. 
Lower rates of breastfeeding and adverse child and maternal health outcomes that are associated 
with cesarean birth are found to explain less than a third of the cognitive gap, which points to the 
importance of other mechanisms such as disturbed gut microbiota. The findings underline the need for 
a precautionary approach in responding to requests for a planned cesarean when there are no apparent 
elevated risks from vaginal birth.
Cesarean sections can save lives, but rates well above the World Health Organization’s recommended 15% ceiling 
in most developed countries suggest that many procedures are unnecessary1. In the OECD, the rate of caesarean 
section has increased from 14.4% of deliveries in 1990 to 25.8% in 20092, growth that cannot be explained by 
increases in obstetric risk factors, including those associated with delayed and multiple infant pregnancy and 
maternal obesity3–6. Instead, this growth is believed to be related to increased maternal request and changes in 
clinical practice7. A concern is that many procedures are made without considering possible long-run implica-
tions, such as reduced fertility8. In this study, we concentrate on examining possible long-term implications for 
child cognitive development.
Cesarean birth may be directly and indirectly associated with negative child cognitive outcomes. The indi-
rect association may occur through established links between cesarean birth and adverse child health outcomes, 
including asthma, type I diabetes, allergies9–11 and obesity12 that are also associated with impaired functioning 
and lower academic performance13, 14. The surgical nature of cesarean procedures also poses postnatal maternal 
health risks15, with potential knock-on effects for the child’s development through altered mother-child interac-
tions16 and lower rates of breastfeeding17–19.
The direct association may occur through alterations to the infant’s gut microbiota. Unlike vaginally-born 
children whose gut is seeded by passing through the birth canal, the gut of cesarean-born children is seeded 
through contact with the mother’s skin and hospital surfaces. The result is long-term compositional differences in 
gut microbiota by mode of birth20–24, with differences observed up until age seven24. Recently uncovered chem-
ical signaling from the gut microbiota to the central nervous system, affecting memory, motivation, mood and 
stress reactivity, raises questions about the long-term cognitive effects of disturbed microbiota composition at 
a sensitive time in brain development25, 26. Although causal impacts on child development are yet to be proven, 
altered signaling from disturbed gut microbiota is thought to be a possible driver of higher rates of cognitive dis-
orders, especially autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), among 
cesarean-born children (see Curran et al.27 for a review). In animal studies, there is mounting (and replicated)

evidence of long-term cognitive impacts from early microbiota disturbance. These studies show that rodents 
lacking all gut bacteria from birth (germ-free animals) have memory deficits28 and behavioral abnormalities29, 30  
when compared to animals with normal gut microbiota. Interestingly, these cognitive deficits in rodents can be 
corrected through the colonization of the intestine via a fecal transplant from the control group, but only if it 
occurs early in life. The implication is that there is a critical window to correct any disruption to the gut microbi-
ota, after which cognitive impacts are permanent25.
In this study, we estimate the relation between cesarean birth and child cognitive outcomes using data from the 
Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC), a nationally representative birth cohort surveyed biennially, 
and multivariate regression techniques. To the best of our knowledge, only Bentley et al.31 has examined the rela-
tion between cesarean birth and cognitive outcomes. Using Australian hospital records linked to teacher-based 
assessments in the first year of school, they found a significant negative association across several developmental 
domains. We build on this study and that of previous health studies in several ways. First, we build on the work 
of Bentley et al.31 by using mediation analysis to test to what extent any relation is associated with lower rates of 
breastfeeding and adverse child and maternal health outcomes. This is important because it helps to identify the 
importance of direct effects, such as those related to disturbed gut microbiota and helps identify how widespread 
any effects may be within the population. Second, LSAC contains rich longitudinal cognitive test information that 
enables us to gain an insight into longer-term outcomes that are closely related to early academic achievement, 
an important predictor of lifelong earnings and health. These include academic test results that measure: school 
readiness at 4–5, vocabulary and comprehension at 4–5, 6–7 and 8–9 years, problem solving at 6–7 and 8–9 years 
and national achievement in numeracy and literacy at 8–9 years. Third, we more rigorously test the sensitivity of 
any relation to bias from confounding variables not observed in the data or ‘selection on unobserved covariates’
. 
We do this using two methods — re-estimating on a sub-sample where selection on unobserved covariates is 
likely to be less of an issue (privately insured births without any observed perinatal risk factors) and by estimating 
lower-bound estimates under conservative assumptions about the magnitude of selection on unobserved covar-
iates using the Oster32 technique. This helps to provide some guidance on whether estimated relation is plausibly 
causal.
Methods
Data. 
LSAC is an internationally recognized and widely-used longitudinal cohort survey of child health and 
development33, 34. There are multiple cohorts of LSAC that are designed for examining specific development peri-
ods. In this study, we use the LSAC ‘B cohort’
, which has an initial sample of around 5,100 infants born between 
March 2003 to February 2004, drawn randomly from all registered national births at the time. The initial survey, 
conducted between 6 months and a year after birth, contains rich perinatal information about the mother and 
study child along with detailed information on the parents’ background and current life circumstances. From the 
initial survey, children and their primary care giver are surveyed biennially. At the time of analysis, data were only 
available up until wave 5 (2014) of the survey when the children are 8–9.
Of the initial 5,100 LSAC participants, we omit around 1,300 from the sample because of missing information 
by wave 5, due mainly to survey attrition. To examine the potential impact of attrition, for two measures that are 
observed in wave 3 (Peabody Picture Vocabulary and Who Am I?), we compare relations estimated using the full 
sample available at wave 3 and relations estimated at wave 3 on a restricted sample that remain in the survey until 
wave 5 (n = 3,666). Using a two-sample t-test, we find no evidence that results estimated results at wave 3 are 
different for the full and restricted samples (χ
2 = 0.54, p-value = 0.46 and χ
2 = 1.64, p-value = 0.20 respectively). 
The implication is that non-random attrition does not appear to be seriously biasing our results.
Whether participants in LSAC are cesarean born is identified in the initial survey by the primary care giver’s 
response to the question, “was…the type of birth/ delivery method a cesarean?” In our sample, approximately 
30% of primary care givers report that their children were cesarean-born (between March 2003 and February 
2004). To the extent that there is a stigma associated with elective procedures, a potential concern is that the rate 
of cesarean birth may be under-reported in LSAC (social desirability bias). However, this is not borne out in 
national statistics from hospital records that show comparable rates of cesarean birth — 28% and 30% for 2003 
and 2004 respectively35, 36. Compared to other OECD countries, Australia’s rate is similar to that of the United 
States and Germany, but lower than in Italy (38%) and Brazil (54%) and higher than Finland, Norway and Sweden 
(around 17%)37.
Data availability. 
No data were specifically collected for this project. The data used was previously col-
lected by the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS) and was conducted in full accordance with all relevant 
guidelines and regulations as spelt out in the AIFS Ethics Committee approval. This includes obtaining consent 
for survey participation and use of anonymized information for research purposes, as approved by AIFS. AIFS 
provided anonymized data for this project under an individual license agreement. In the analysis and in preparing 
the manuscript, we have adhered to all requirements under the license agreement. Data can be made available 
upon request to the corresponding author, subject to approval from AIFS.
Outcomes. 
Measures of cognitive development. There are two types of cognitive development measures in 
LSAC. The first are scores from three interviewer-administered tests conducted between ages 4 and 9 that are part 
of the LSAC survey and the second are scores from a national standardized test in numeracy and literacy at age 
8–9 that are matched to LSAC participants. All cognitive measures are age-normalized and standardized with 
respect to the weighted sample mean and standard deviation (descriptive statistics in Table 1 are age normalized, 
but unstandardized).
The interviewer-administered cognitive tests from LSAC B are the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT)38; 
Who Am I? (WAI)39 and the Matrix Reasoning test (MR)40. The PPVT is an age appropriate vocabulary test

designed to measure a child’s knowledge of the meaning of spoken words and their comprehension and ability to 
respond. The test was carried out in survey when the children were aged 4–5, 6–7 and 8–9. WAI is an assessment 
of the child’s readiness for school and measures the child’s ability to perform a range of tasks, such as reading, 
writing, copying, and symbol recognition. WAI was only carried out when the children were 4–5. Finally, MR is 
a test of problem solving ability, based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. The test is age appropriate 
and was conducted when the children were aged 6–7 and 8–9.
The national standardized tests are from the National Assessment Program for Literacy and Numeracy 
(NAPLAN). NAPLAN is conducted in all Australian schools to measure performance in numeracy and literacy 
at grades 3, 5, 7 and 9, corresponding to ages 8–9, 10–11, 12–13 and 14–15. In the case of literacy, performance is 
measured over the domains of reading, writing, grammar and spelling. Each student’s performance in NAPLAN, 
including their national ranking compared to similar-age students, is made available to schools and students 
to monitor performance. At the time of analysis, only NAPLAN data for grade 3 was available for the LSAC B 
cohort. For students who were not in grade 3 at the time of testing, usually because they commenced school at 
a later age than the rest of the cohort, we imputed their values. The imputation process involved two steps. The 
first step involved using the sample with observed grade 3 NAPLAN scores to estimate regression model relations 
between grade 3 NAPLAN scores and personal information (such as other interviewer-administered cognitive 
tests). In the second step, we use results from the first step to generate predicted NAPLAN values for those with 
missing scores, that is, we apply the estimated regression model relations to the personal characteristics of those 
with missing NAPLAN scores41. Imputing these values instead of omitting them makes little difference to our 
analysis (see Table S1 of the online supporting material).
Mediators. In this study we measure the extent to which any relation between cesarean birth and cognitive 
development is mediated by lower rates of breastfeeding and adverse child and maternal health outcomes. We 
selected these variables because they have been previously associated with cesarean birth and are available in the 
data9–19. Adverse child health outcomes include measures of obesity and care giver reported diagnosis of asthma, 
ADD or ASD. While measures of asthma and obesity are available at the time of cognitive testing, measures for 
ADD and ASD are only available at ages 6–7 and 8–9 years. Because only around two-thirds of care givers answer 
questions related to ADD and ASD at age 6–7, we use information at age 8–9 years when the response rate is 
much higher. Obesity is measured by whether the child’s Body Mass Index (BMI) is above the upper-limit of nor-
mal range of 19.3 for those 4–7 years and 23 for 8–9 years. Breastfeeding and maternal health measures are from 
the initial sample (6–12 months after birth). Breastfeeding is a binary measure of whether the child was breastfed 
at three months or not. Two self-reported postnatal maternal health measures were used: whether any depressive 
symptoms were experienced in the last 4 weeks (score of below 3 on a 6-point Kessler scale) and whether general 
health was reported as fair to poor (4 or 5 on a 5-point scale, where 1 is excellent health).
Controls. 
The analysis includes over 20 confounders grouped into two main categories (Table 1): those related 
to perinatal risk factors and those related to the socio-economic advantage associated with cesarean-born chil-
dren in Australia. Perinatal risk factors include the taking of medication during pregnancy for blood pressure or 
diabetes (proxies for pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes respectively), the taking of antibiotic medication (a 
proxy for bacterial infection, which may also affect the development of the infant’s gut microbiome); a dummy 
variable for low birth weight (coded 1 if less than 2.5 kg; 0 otherwise); weeks of gestation; maternal age at birth; 
dummy variable for multiple infant pregnancy; length and head circumference of baby (z-scores); dummy vari-
able for whether the baby was conceived using IVF treatment and a gender dummy. We include taking antibiotic 
medication as a control because it has been associated with changes to the infant’s gut microbiome42 and possibly 
the risk of cesarean birth, which means failure to control for it will lead to bias due to unobserved confounding. 
However, we stress that our results are not sensitive to the inclusion of this control, or other child and maternal 
health risks in the data (refer to results for the ‘low-risk privately insured’ group in Table 2). Length and head 
circumference z-scores are based on Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts and are age 
and gender-adjusted. We also estimated a model with an alternative treatment of low birth weight (below 1.5 kg) 
and a model on a sub-sample of births with gestational ages of 37–40 weeks using binary dummy variable controls 
for each gestational week (excluding the reference category of 40 weeks). Results for these alternative models are 
much the same as those reported in Table 2 (available upon request from the corresponding author).
Postnatal interventions such as the use of a ventilator and the use of intensive care were not included as con-
trols because they may be considered an outcome of delivery mode. We also refrain from including prenatal risk 
factors available in the data that have a high rate of missing observations. These include an identifier for whether 
the mother is a regular smoker, maternal average consumption of more than two standard drinks a day and 
maternal body mass index outside of normal range (18.5 to 25). Excluding postnatal interventions and prenatal 
a t-test for differences in mean values between cesarean and vaginally born children. bThe descriptive results 
above are age-normalised, but unstandardized to give the reader a fuller picture of the data. In the regression 
analysis, all cognitive performance measures are age-normalised and standardised with respect to the weighted 
sample mean and standard deviation. cAll control variables are taken from wave 1 of the data (2004) when 
children are 0–1 year of age. dDisadvantaged countries are those identified by the Australian Bureau of Statistics 
Standard Australian Classification of Counties (2011), ABS cat. no. 1269.0. eHigh school diploma includes 
vocational equivalent — International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) 1997 level 3 C. fVocational 
education qualification is ISCED 1997 level 4B and 5 A. gZ-scores are based on Centre for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) growth charts and are age and gender-adjusted.

risk factors with high rates of missing observations makes little difference to the results (see Table S2 of the online 
supporting material for model results with these factors included as additional controls).
In general, descriptive statistics of the control variables presented in Table 1 show that cesarean birth is asso-
ciated with higher perinatal risk factors and a socio-economic advantage, especially higher maternal education, 
fewer older siblings, lower rates of un-partnered birth and higher rates of private health insurance. Despite 
Australia’s universally available free public health system, many high income earners in Australia choose to hold 
private health insurance for two reasons. First, it provides a greater coverage of medical treatments, especially 
for allied health services; and second, it enables them to circumvent the payment of an income-contingent levy 
that to help meet the cost of the public health system. Important in the context of this study, maternal requested 
cesarean birth (without any medical risk factors) is not covered by the public health system. While mothers with-
out private health insurance can still elect for cesarean birth in a public hospital, this is uncommon because they 
would incur all medical costs. It is much more common for elective cesareans to occur in private hospitals under 
the cover of private health insurance. This explains the 11 percentage point higher rate of private health insurance 
among cesarean born children than among vaginally born children.
Statistical method. 
In our main analysis, we use OLS multivariate regression models for each of the cog-
nitive measures to estimate the relation between cesarean birth and cognitive development. These models are of 
the following form:

where CSi equals one if child i was cesarean-born, 0 otherwise, SESi and PNi are vectors of family socio-economic 
status and perinatal characteristics respectively (from Table 1) and υ
i is an error term.
To try and explain the importance of possible channels, we measure the extent to which γ
1is mediated by lower 
rates of breastfeeding and adverse child and maternal health outcomes in the data. Mediating effects are estimated 
using the product of the coefficients method43.
Identification of the main parameter of interest, γ
1 in equation (1) and the mediating effects is complicated by 
potential unobserved confounding, which means that γ
1 may be biased by correlation between CSi and υ
i. The 
main potential sources of unobserved confounding may be missing controls for perinatal risk factors (such as 
oxygen deprivation during birth) and socio-economic advantage (such as greater household income) associated 
with cesarean-born children. The presence of the former will lead to an over-estimate of any true negative relation 
between cesarean birth and cognitive development; whereas the presence of the latter will lead to an 
under-estimate of any negative relation.
Without the possibility for randomization, a common approach for dealing with this form of bias is instru-
mental variables. This method relies on the presence of factors in the data that affect cognitive development 
only through altering the chances of cesarean birth. We are unaware of any strong candidates in our data and we 
instead concentrate on testing the sensitivity of our results to bias from the presence of selection on unobserved 
covariates. These are discussed in detail below.
Sensitivity to unobserved perinatal confounders. We use two approaches to test the sensitivity of our OLS esti-
mates to bias from unobserved perinatal covariates. First, we re-estimate OLS relations (using equation (1)) on 
a sub-sample of 2,140 births that are free of any observed health risk that may lead to cesarean birth and that are 
privately insured; termed, ‘low-risk privately insured’ group. The idea is that by restricting the sample to those that 
are more similar on observed covariates, we are reducing bias by also restricting differences in unobserved covar-
iates. The ‘Low-risk privately insured’ sub-sample are those that are not low birth weight (above 2,500 grams), 
full-term (38–40 week gestation), singleton, conceived without IVF, whose mother took no blood pressure or 
diabetes medication during pregnancy and whose parents were privately insured in the year of birth. These mod-
els include all other covariates included in the full sample. We omitted those without private health insurance 
because they are more likely than those with private insurance to have a cesarean performed for medical reasons.
In the second approach, we use the Oster32 method, which like approaches proposed by Rosenbaum44 and 
Altonji45, bounds the relation under assumptions about selection on unobserved covariates (see Nghiema, 
Nguyen, Khanam and Connelly46 and Hanushek, Schwerdt, Woessmann and Zhang47 for recent applications of 
the Oster method). Under the Oster method, we estimate the lower bound of the OLS relation between cesarean 
birth and measures of child cognitive development using the following:

Results
The estimated OLS relations between cesarean birth and child cognitive outcomes (equation (1)) for all births 
in our sample (n = 3,666) are reported in Table 2. The estimated coefficients for the control variables in this 
model can be found in Tables S3a and S3b of online supporting material. Generally speaking, the signs of these 
control variable coefficients are as expected, with the largest effects associated with maternal socio-economic 
factors. Specifically, we find that child cognitive outcomes are positively associated with mothers that are college 
educated (3-year bachelor degree), who give birth at an older age, who are partnered, who have private health 
insurance, are employed and have fewer previous births. The estimated coefficients of perinatal risk factors are 
generally insignificant or smaller and of mixed sign. Specifically, we find that taking blood pressure medication 
during pregnancy is associated with significant lower cognitive outcomes, while greater head circumference and 
body length is associated with positive cognitive outcomes. Consistent with previous studies, we find evidence, 
albeit only for select child cognitive outcomes, of a positive association with gestational age31, 48 and a negative 
association with low body weight (less than 2.5 kg)49. For the former, the association is only significant for school 
readiness at 4–5 and for the latter; the association is only significant for school readiness at 4–5, vocabulary at 
4–5 years and vocabulary at 6–7 years. In alternative models estimated on 37–40 week births with individual 
gestational week dummy variables, we find few significant differences in outcomes between 37, 38 and 39 weeks 
relative to the reference case of 40 weeks for any of the outcomes.
Turning to estimates in Table 2, we observe significant negative relations between cesarean birth and measures 
of child cognitive development, up to a tenth of a standard deviation. The magnitude of the relations is similar 
across all measures, but only those with (NAPLAN) grammar, numeracy, reading, and writing at age 8–9, prob-
lem solving (MR) and vocabulary (PPVT) at age 4–5 are statistically significant at the 0.1 level or higher. To put 
the size of these relations into perspective, a tenth of a standard deviation is similar in magnitude to the estimated 
relation between gender and reading in NAPLAN at age 8–9 (reported in Table S5a) and effects estimated from 
improving teacher quality by one standard deviation and reducing average grade 3 class sizes by ten50.
Results from the first stage of our mediating analysis suggest that cesarean birth is significantly associated 
with lower rates of breastfeeding and higher rates of obesity and ADD (see Table S4 of online supporting mate-
rial). Second stage results show that breastfeeding is significantly associated with higher cognitive performance, 
whereas ADD, ASD and obesity are significantly associated with lower levels of cognitive performance. Poor

maternal general health is significantly associated with lower vocabulary at 4–5 years, but otherwise maternal 
health is not significantly linked to any of the cognitive measures.
Combining these results, breastfeeding, obesity and ADD are found to significantly mediate the relation 
between cesarean birth and child cognitive outcomes, although the effects size and significance vary (Table 3). 
Individually, the largest mediating effect is through reduced chances of breastfeeding, which explains 0.008 per-
centage points out of the 0.076 percentage point difference (or around 11%) of the gap in grade 3 NAPLAN writ-
ing scores. The total mediating effect, generated from regressions when all of the mediators are included together, 
account for between 25% for reading (p = 0.052) and 29% for numeracy (p = 0.021) of the estimated difference in 
cognitive outcomes by delivery mode. This still leaves at least 70% of the relations unexplained by these mediators.
Sensitivity test results. 
The estimated relations using the low-risk privately insured sample are generally 
larger than those estimated using the entire sample. A possible explanation is that by limiting the sample to 
privately-insured births we are reducing the unobserved confounding from the socio-economic advantage asso-
ciated with cesarean-born children, which in the main analysis under-states the true effects of cesarean birth.
The Oster coefficients in Table 2 represent the possible lower-bound of any relation between cesarean birth 
and cognitive development measures under the conservative assumption that selection on unobserved covari-
ates is the same as selection on observed covariates. An alternative interpretation is that the Oster parameter is 
the magnitude of the relation if adjustment from unobserved covariates is the same as adjustment from observed 
covariates in the model. With the exception of school readiness at 4–5 years and problem solving at 6–7 years, the 
Oster coefficients are much the same as the OLS regression coefficients estimated on the entire sample. Results 
of these sensitivity tests suggest that the estimated OLS relations are unlikely to be entirely driven by bias from 
unobserved confounding.
Discussion
We find a negative relation between cesarean birth and a range of cognitive outcomes measured from ages 4 to 9. 
These relations are established after controlling for the socio-economic advantage associated with cesarean birth 
in Australia and a rich set of perinatal risk factors that (from meta-analyses)9, 11, 27 are commonly used in child 
health studies. Our results are consistent with results from the only previous study that we are aware of by Bentley 
et al.31, which found cesarean-born children had a 14% higher risk of being identified as being developmentally 
high risk at school starting age. While the magnitude of our estimated difference in outcomes is not large, up to 
a tenth of a standard deviation in national test scores in numeracy, they are large enough to warrant action. A 
tenth of a standard deviation in national test scores is comparable in size to differences related to gender, class

Table 3. Mediating effects of breastfeeding and adverse child and maternal health outcomes on cognitive 
development. ***p-value < 0.01; **p-value < 0.05; *p-value < 0.1. Standard errors are in parentheses. Results 
are estimated with adjustments for all confounders related to family socio-economic and perinatal risk factors. 
aBreastfeeding is a binary measure of whether the mother report breastfeeding at 3 months after birth. bObesity 
is measured each year of the sample. A child is identified as obese using a binary measure of whether the child’s 
Body Mass Index is above the normal range at the time of cognitive testing (19.3 for those age 4–5 and 23 for 
8–9). cAsthma, attention deficit disorder (ADD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are binary measures 
based on maternal reports of diagnosis. Diagnosis of ADD and ASD is only asked at age 8–9, whereas the 
diagnosis of asthma is asked each year. For asthma, we use information from the time of cognitive testing. 
dPoor maternal health is self-reporting of fair or poor general health (4 or 5 on a 5-point scale of general 
health) and maternal mental health is ever experienced depressive symptoms in the last 4 weeks (a score 
below 3 on a Kessler 6-point scale of mental health). eFor the outcome of Vocabulary at age 4–5, there is no 
information on ADD and ASD at the time of testing because these conditions are typically not diagnosed until 
later. Information on diagnosis of ADD and ASD at 8–9 may still be a valid measure of the presence of these 
conditions at 4–5.

size and teacher quality that are the focus of policy effort. Importantly, much of the estimated relations (around 
70%) are found to be unrelated to lower rates of breastfeeding and adverse child and maternal health, including 
the diagnosis of child cognitive disorders.
We make two important contributions to the Bentley et al.31 study. First, our sensitivity analysis suggests that 
bias from unobserved confounding is unlikely to explain the results completely and that causal relations are plau-
sible. This does not mean that we have established causal relations because bias from unobserved confounding is 
still possible. Potential perinatal risks not controlled for include inheritable genetic traits, such as a lack of mater-
nal height, that may drive both cesarean birth (due to a relatively small pelvis (cephalopelvic disproportion))51 
and child cognitive outcomes52. Second, our estimated relations persist long-term and are not confined to chil-
dren with health problems. Bentley et al.31 used perinatal records linked to school starting-age measures of cog-
nition and could not examine longer-term outcomes or quantify mediating effects. By showing that only a small 
part of the cognitive gap is explained by mediating factors, our results leave open the possibility that direct mech-
anisms, such as disturbed gut microbiota, may be important. However, we cannot rule-out the possibility that 
at least some of the residual effect is due to measurement error, for example, under-reporting of the presence of 
health conditions by the primary care giver, or that the mediating effects are biased by unobserved confounding.
Evidence presented in this study should motivate more research. Because experimentation is unsuitable, 
future studies may focus instead on instrumental variables estimation using large-scale linked hospital and child 
development administrative records. The instrumental variables approach exploits natural experiments, that is, 
random events that lead to variation in assignment to treatment without directly affecting outcomes. A limitation 
of this method is that the results only have a local treatment interpretation and cannot be generalized to those 
unaffected by the random event that led to assignment.
With the above caveats in mind, the key message to medical practitioners is to take a precautionary approach 
when formulating birth plans, especially when there are no apparent elevated health risks from vaginal birth. 
Informing mothers of the risks and benefits of cesarean birth should be a priority, which may be formalized by 
incorporating education sessions into practitioner guidelines.
