IMPORTANCE Existing guidelines and systematic reviews lack clear recommendations for
prevention of low back pain (LBP).
OBJECTIVE To investigate the effectiveness of interventions for prevention of LBP.
DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale, and Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to November 22, 2014.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of prevention strategies for nonspecific LBP.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed
the risk of bias. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale was used to evaluate the
risk-of-bias. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
system was used to describe the quality of evidence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measure was an episode of LBP, and
the secondary outcome measure was an episode of sick leave associated with LBP. We
calculated relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs using random-effects models.
RESULTS The literature search identified 6133 potentially eligible studies; of these, 23
published reports (on 21 different randomized clinical trials including 30 850 unique
participants) met the inclusion criteria. With results presented as RRs (95% CIs), there was
moderate-quality evidence that exercise combined with education reduces the risk of an
episode of LBP (0.55 [0.41-0.74]) and low-quality evidence of no effect on sick leave (0.74
[0.44-1.26]). Low- to very low–quality evidence suggested that exercise alone may reduce the
risk of both an LBP episode (0.65 [0.50-0.86]) and use of sick leave (0.22 [0.06-0.76]). For
education alone, there was moderate- to very low–quality evidence of no effect on LBP (1.03
[0.83-1.27]) or sick leave (0.87 [0.47-1.60]). There was low- to very low–quality evidence that
back belts do not reduce the risk of LBP episodes (1.01 [0.71-1.44]) or sick leave (0.87
[0.47-1.60]). There was low-quality evidence of no protective effect of shoe insoles on LBP
(1.01 [0.74-1.40]).
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The current evidence suggests that exercise alone or in
combination with education is effective for preventing LBP. Other interventions, including
education alone, back belts, and shoe insoles, do not appear to prevent LBP. Whether
education, training, or ergonomic adjustments prevent sick leave is uncertain because the
quality of evidence is low.

L
owbackpain(LBP)isoneofthemostburdensomehealth
problemsworldwide,1generatingenormouscostsintreat-
ments and time lost from work.2 The global point preva-
lence of LBP is 12%; with the aging population, the number of
peopleaffectedislikelytoincreaseoverthecomingyears.3Akey
contributor to the burden is the high recurrence rate: approxi-
matelyone-halfofpatientsexperiencearecurrenceofLBPwithin
1yearafterrecoveringfromapreviousepisode.4-6Itistherefore
important to know whether it is possible to prevent LBP and, if
so, which interventions are most effective.
Although there have been several systematic reviews of
strategies to prevent LBP, most have major limitations. Many
of the existing reviews are out-of-date,7,8 report data from ran-
domized clinical trials (RCTs) of symptomatic participants,9 do
not consider the strength of evidence (eg, using the Grading
of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evalu-
ation [GRADE] system),8,10 are restricted to a particular type
ofintervention11orsetting,ordonotfollowaprespecified,pub-
licly accessible protocol.7,8
Therefore, a comprehensive, high-quality review that in-
cludes the most recent publications is needed to provide a cur-
rentoverviewoftheeffectivenessofpreventionstrategies.The
aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence on
the effectiveness of interventions for prevention of episodes
of LBP and use of sick leave due to LBP.
Methods
Literature Search
The PRISMA Statement was used to guide the conduct and re-
porting of the study.12 This study searched the following elec-
tronicdatabasesfromtheearliestrecordtoNovember22,2014:
MEDLINE,EMBASE,PhysiotherapyEvidenceDatabase(PEDro),
and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. A sensi-
tivesearchstrategywasusedbasedontherecommendationsof
the Cochrane Back Review Group13 for randomized controlled
trialsandbackpainaswellassearchtermsforprevention.14The
fullsearchstrategyisoutlinedineTable1intheSupplement.The
reference lists of relevant reviews and trials were screened for
additional studies, and we also used citation tracking of all in-
cluded trials.
During the first screening, 2 reviewers (D.S. or M.J.H. with
V.C.O. or M.C.) evaluated the titles and abstracts of each cita-
tion and excluded clearly irrelevant studies. For each poten-
tially eligible study, 2 reviewers (D.S. or M.J.H. with V.C.O. or
M.C.) examined the full-text article and assessed whether the
study fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In cases of disagree-
ment,adecisionwasmadebyconsensusor,ifnecessary,athird
reviewer (C.G.M.) was consulted.
Study Selection
We included RCTs assessing the effectiveness of prevention
strategies for nonspecific LBP. To be eligible, trials needed to
meet the following criteria: (1) included participants without
LBPatstudyentryoratleast1outcomewasnotpresentatbase-
line (eg, some participants had mild LBP, but all were work-
ingandthestudyoutcomewasanepisodeofworkabsencedue
to LBP); (2) aimed to prevent future episodes of LBP; (3) com-
pared intervention group with groups that received no inter-
vention, placebo, or minimal intervention; and (4) reported a
measure of a new episode of LBP (eg, episode of LBP or epi-
sode of sick leave due to LBP). Studies that used a quasi-
randomized design or reported the comparison of 2 preven-
tion strategies (eg, exercise vs lumbar support) were excluded.
No restrictions were placed on the setting or context of the in-
cluded studies, languages, or date of the RCT report.
Data Extraction and Synthesis
We assessed the quality of the trials’methods using the PEDro
scale15,16 by either downloading the available scores from the
PEDro database (http://www.pedro.org.au) or rating the trial
ourselves. Scores on the PEDro scale range from 0 (very low
methodologic quality) to 10 (high methodological quality);
methodologic quality was not an inclusion criterion of this re-
view.
Two independent reviewers (D.S. or M.J.H. with V.C.O. or
M.C.) extracted the characteristics and intervention out-
comes of each trial using a standardized data extraction form.
Whenpossible,weextractedtherawoutcomes(numberofper-
sons having an episode of LBP) for each group (intervention
and control) and calculated the estimates of treatment effect
using methods recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Version 5.1.0.17
To evaluate the overall quality of the evidence, we used
the GRADE system.18 The GRADE classification was down-
graded from high quality by 1 level for each factor that we
encountered: (1) design limitation (>25% of participants from
studies with low methodologic quality: PEDro score <7), (2)
inconsistency of results (wide variance of point estimates
across studies or large heterogeneity between trials:
I2 >50%), and (3) imprecision (<400 participants for each
outcome). We did not consider the indirectness criterion in
this review because we included a specific population with
relevant outcomes and direct comparisons. A GRADE profile
was completed for each pooled estimate and for single trials
comparing an LBP prevention strategy with controls. When
only single RCTs were available, evidence from studies with
fewer than 400 participants was downgraded for inconsis-
tency and imprecision (ie, sparse data) and rated as low-
quality evidence. These trials could be further downgraded
to very low–quality evidence if limitations of study design
were found (PEDro score <7). Two reviewers (D.S. or M.J.H.
with V.C.O. or M.C.) judged whether these factors were
present for each outcome. The quality of evidence was
defined as (1) high (further research is unlikely to change our
confidence in the estimate of effect and there are no known
or suspected reporting biases: all domains are fulfilled); (2)
moderate (further research is likely to have an important
effect on our confidence in the estimate of effect and might
change the estimate: 1 of the domains is not fulfilled); (3) low
(further research is likely to have an important effect on our
confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change
the estimate: 2 of the domains are not fulfilled); and (4) very
low (we are uncertain about the estimate: 3 of the domains
are not fulfilled).19

Statistical Analysis
Outcome data were extracted for short-term (follow-up evalu-
ations ≤12 months) and long-term (follow-up evaluations >12
months) follow-up. When multiple time points fell into the
same category, we used the longest follow-up period.
Trials considered homogeneous were grouped according
to the prevention strategy, comparison group, outcome (LBP
episode and sick leave), and outcome assessment time points
(short-term and long-term). We calculated relative risks (RRs)
and 95% CIs and used the random-effects model to pool esti-
mates for each analysis obtained with Comprehensive Meta-
analysis, version 2.2.064 (Biostat). For trials that did not re-
port the sample size at the end of the follow-up period, we
calculated the RR using the baseline sample size.
Results
The initial electronic database search identified 6133 poten-
tially eligible studies. After screening citations by title and ab-
stract, we considered 159 potentially eligible studies for in-
clusionandretrievedfull-textarticles.Twenty-threepublished
reports (21 different RCTs including 30 850 unique partici-
pants) met the inclusion criteria and were included in this
review.20-42 Two RCTs were reported in 4 articles22,30,39,40 (2
with 12-month data22,39 and 2 with 36-month data30,40).
Figure 1 outlines the flow of RCTs through the review.
The included trials investigated 6 different LBP preven-
tion strategies: exercise, education, exercise and education,
back belts, shoe insoles, and other prevention strategies. Most
ofthetrialsfocusedlargelyorcompletelyonworking-agepopu-
lations. The sample size of the trials ranged from 30 to 4325
participants. A comprehensive description of each trial is pro-
vided in Table 1.
Methodologicqualityassessmentwasconductedusingthe
PEDro scale. The mean (SD) score was 5.1 (1.5), with the key
problem items being blinding, concealed allocation, and loss
to follow-up (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
EstimatesoftheeffectsofLBPpreventionstrategiesonLBP
episode or sick leave due to LBP were calculated for 21 trials.
The number of events, sample size, and RRs (95% CIs) for the
trials are presented in eTable 3 in the Supplement. Trials were
grouped according to the prevention strategy, outcome (epi-
sode of LBP or sick leave), and follow-up time point (short- or
long-term). Table 2 provides a summary of the findings and
GRADE quality ratings.
Exercise vs Control, Minimal Intervention,
or Supplement
Four trials reporting data on 898 participants were included
inthemeta-analysistoestimatetheshort-term(ie,≤12months)
efficacy of exercise on incident cases of LBP (presented as RR
[95% CI]).21,25,26,42 The pooled results provide low-quality evi-
dence of a protective effect of exercise (0.65 [0.50-0.86]). In
the long-term (ie, >12 months), the pooled results of 2 trials
(334 participants) provide very low–quality evidence of no ef-
fect of exercise (1.04 [0.73-1.49]) (Figure 2).21,33 Two trials pre-
sented data from 128 participants and provide very low–
quality evidence that exercise reduces the risk of sick leave due
to LBP in the long-term (0.22 [0.06-0.76]) (Figure 3).30,42
Exercise and Education vs Control, Minimal Intervention,
or Supplement
Theeffectofexerciseandeducationwasinvestigatedin4trials
(442 participants) at short-term follow-up,22,35,39,42 and in 2
trials (138 participants) at long-term follow-up (LBP
episode).30,40 The pooled results (presented as RR [95% CI])
of 4 trials provide moderate-quality evidence that exercise and
education reduce the risk of an episode of LBP at short-term
follow-up (0.55 [0.41-0.74]). The long-term results are based
on 2 trials30,40 and provide low-quality evidence of a protec-
tive effect (0.73 [0.55-0.96]) (Figure 2).
For prevention of sick leave due to LBP, 3 trials (228
participants)22,39,42 presented short-term data and 2 trials (138
participants)30,40 presented long-term data. The pooled re-
sults (presented as RR [95% CI]) provide low-quality evi-
dence of no protective effect at short-term follow-up (0.74
[0.44-1.26])orlong-termfollow-up(0.72[0.48-1.08])(Figure3).

tion on sick leave due to LBP at short-term follow-up (RR,

Back Belts vs Control, Minimal Intervention,
or Supplement
The efficacy of back belts over control to prevent LBP epi-
sodes (short- and long-term) or sick leave owing to LBP (short-
term) was reported in 3 trials.27,34,41 For episodes of LBP, pool-
ing of 2 trials (329 participants) (presented as RR [95% CI])
provides very low–quality evidence of no short-term effect of
backbeltsovercontrols(1.01[0.71-1.44])(Figure2).27,41Atlong-
term follow-up, a single trial (8472 participants) provides mod-
erate-quality evidence that back belts do not reduce the risk
of LBP episodes when compared with controls (0.85 [0.64-
1.14])(Figure2).34ForsickleaveowingtoLBP,asingletrial(282

[95% CI, 0.73-2.86]) (Figure 3).41
Shoe Insole vs Control, Minimal Intervention,
or Supplement
Four trials reported data from 1833 participants on the short-
term efficacy of shoe insoles compared with controls.23,24,36,38
For prevention of episodes of LBP, there is low-quality evi-
dence that shoe insoles are not superior to control at short-
term follow-up (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.74-1.40]) (Figure 2). One
trial reported the efficacy of semirigid shoe insole vs control
andsoftshoeinsolevscontrol.24Onlythegroupfromthesemi-
rigid shoe insole was included in the meta-analysis.
Other LBP Prevention Strategies
Two trials reported the short-term effect of other prevention
strategies vs control for LBP episode (3047 participants),29 and
sick leave due to LBP (360 participants).32 An ergonomic pro-
gram (moderate-quality evidence) was not more effective than
control in reducing episodes of LBP at short-term follow-up
(odds ratio, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.97-1.57]) (Table 2). It is unclear
whether sick leave due to LBP can be prevented by educa-
tion,training,andergonomicadjustmentssincetherewasvery
low–quality evidence (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.51-1.76]) (Figure 3).
Discussion
Statement of Principal Findings
The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis indi-
cate that exercise in combination with education is likely to
reduce the risk of LBP. Exercise alone may reduce the risk of
an episode of LBP and sick leave; however, it is uncertain

whethertheeffectspersistbeyond1year.Educationalone,back
belts, shoe insoles, and ergonomic adjustments probably do
not prevent an episode of LBP or sick leave due to LBP. It is un-
certain whether education, training, or ergonomic adjust-
ments prevent LBP owing to the very low quality of evidence.
Strengths and Weaknesses of the Study
The strengths of this review include the use of a prespecified
protocol registered on PROSPERO, inclusion of all preven-
tion strategies from any setting, the use of the GRADE sys-
tem to evaluate the overall quality of the evidence, and the
use of a highly sensitive search strategy to identify LBP pre-
vention trials. We assessed trials’methodologic quality with
the PEDro scale, which has been shown to have acceptable
reliability and validity.15,16,44 All scores were available online
at the PEDro website. These scores were rated by experi-
enced PEDro researchers, which provided less chance of
errors.
This review was designed to be comprehensive with a ro-
bust search strategy; however, it is possible that not all stud-
ies were identified. Some identified trials did not have the term
prevention in either the title or the abstract.27,33,34 For several

prevention strategies, we could identify only a small number
of trials; this combined with the quality of the trials means the
level of evidence for several prevention strategies is very low
or low.
Comparison With Other Studies
To our knowledge, this review is the first to have included a
variety of LBP prevention strategies and conducted a meta-
analysis of RCTs. Several reviews have investigated the
effectiveness of an exercise and/or education program on
LBP prevention. All are out-of-date, included at least 1 RCT
with symptomatic participants at baseline (ie, the trial evalu-
ated treatment, not prevention), and presented data
descriptively.7-9,45-49 The most recent review we know of
investigating the effectiveness of exercise for preventing a
LBP episode,11 presented data from 3 trials. One was
included in the meta-analysis of the current review (ie, exer-
cise vs control),33 one was excluded because the trial
included symptomatic participants at baseline,50 and one
was included in a different LBP prevention strategy (ie, exer-
cise and education vs control).39 That review by Choi et al11
reported a 50% (2 RCTs with 130 patients) reduction in
future LBP episodes when compared with no intervention,
which is a larger effect than our estimate of a 35% reduction
(4 RCTs with 898 patients).
Previous reviews investigating the efficacy of exercise on
the prevention of LBP episodes have not distinguished be-
tween studies that included education with the exercise from
those just including exercise.11,45,46 In our review, the combi-
nationofexerciseandeducationwaseffectiveatlong-termfol-
low-up (RR, 0.73 [95%CI, 0.55 to 0.96]), while exercise alone
was not (RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.49]), suggesting that the
distinctionbetweenexercisealoneandexercisecombinedwith
education may be important.
The present review’
s finding that back belts do not pre-
vent LBP is consistent with results of a previous systematic
review.51 There are a few previous systematic reviews10,45,52
investigating the use of shoe insoles in the prevention of an
LBP episode. Findings from these reviews are in line with the
results of our study: shoe insoles are not effective for the pre-
vention of back pain. The most recent review by Chuter et al10
included 6 trials; our review included 4. We excluded 2 trials
becausetheparticipantsweresymptomaticatthetimeofstudy

tion programs focusing on long-term behavior change in exer-
cise habits seem to be important.

Conclusions
Theresultsofthissystematicreviewandmeta-analysisofRCTs
indicate that exercise in combination with education is likely
to reduce the risk of LBP and that exercise alone may reduce
the risk of an episode of LBP and sick leave due to LBP, at least
for the short-term. The available evidence suggests that edu-
cation alone, back belts, shoe insoles, and ergonomics do not
prevent LBP. It is uncertain whether education, training, or er-
gonomic adjustments prevent sick leave due to LBP because
the quality of evidence is very low.

Exercise and the Prevention of Low Back Pain
Ready for Implementation
Timothy S. Carey, MD, MPH; Janet K. Freburger, PhD
Acute low back pain (LBP) is common, with more than 80%
of us experiencing at least one episode in our lives. It is pain-
ful, a common cause of time off work, and interferes with our
ability to perform daily activities. Fortunately, most episodes
of acute LBP are self-limited and improve with time and con-
servative treatments. However, recurrence is common, with
estimates ranging from 24% to 80% in the first year.1
Afterrecovery,patientsoftenquerytheirhealthcareprofes-
sional on how to avoid future episodes of LBP. The well-
conducted systematic review by Steffens and colleagues2
providesuswithconcreteevi-
denceonthevalueofexercise.
They summarize several low-
to moderate-quality trials that examine the benefits of exercise
andeducationonprimaryandsecondarypreventionofLBPand
sick leave due to LBP. The benefits were fairly consistent across
studies,andtheeffectsizewaslargeenoughtohaveclinicaland
policy importance. Exercise alone or in combination with edu-
cationiseffectiveforpreventingLBP.Theauthorsalsoassessed
otherinterventions,includingeducationwithoutspecificexer-
ciseinstruction,orthoticinsoles,andbackbelts.Theseotherin-
terventions demonstrated minimal, if any, evidence of benefit.

keting materials in our journals and viewing them on televi-
sion. However, formal exercise instruction after an episode of
LBP is uncommonly prescribed by physicians. This pattern is,
unfortunately, similar to other musculoskeletal problems in
which effective but lower-technology and often lower-
reimbursed activities are underused. In one study,3 fewer than
half of the patients with chronic LBP or neck pain who were
surveyed received exercise instruction despite a good evi-
dence base for its effectiveness. Passive treatments (eg, physi-
calmodalities)withlimitedevidenceofeffectivenesswererela-
