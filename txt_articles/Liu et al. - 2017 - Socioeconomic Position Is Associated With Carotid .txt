Background-—Lower socioeconomic position (SEP) predicts higher cardiovascular risk in adults. Few studies differentiate between
neighborhood and family SEP or have repeated measures through childhood, which would inform understanding of potential
mechanisms and the timing of interventions. We investigated whether neighborhood and family SEP, measured biennially from
ages 0 to 1 year onward, was associated with carotid intima–media thickness (IMT) at ages 11 to 12 years.
Methods and Results-—Data were obtained from 1477 families participating in the Child Health CheckPoint study, nested within
the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Disadvantaged family and neighborhood SEP was cross-sectionally associated with
thicker maximum carotid IMT in separate univariable linear regression models. Associations with family SEP were not attenuated in
multivariable analyses, and associations with neighborhood SEP were attenuated only in models adjusted for family SEP. The
difference in maximum carotid IMT between the highest and lowest family SEP quartile measured at ages 10 to 11 years was
10.7 lm (95% CI, 3.4–18.0; P=0.004), adjusted for age, sex, pubertal status, passive smoking exposure, body mass index, blood
pressure, and arterial lumen diameter. In longitudinal analyses, family SEP measured as early as age 2 to 3 years was associated
with maximum carotid IMT at ages 11 to 12 years (difference between highest and lowest quartile: 8.5 lm; 95% CI, 1.3–15.8;
P=0.02). No associations were observed between SEP and mean carotid IMT.
Conclusions-—We report a robust association between lower SEP in early childhood and carotid IMT in mid-childhood. Further
investigation of mechanisms may inform pediatric cardiovascular risk assessment and prevention strategies. (J Am Heart Assoc.

 when important health behaviors such as diet and physical
activity patterns are established.4 Reducing social disparities
in CVD requires better understanding of the early life
determinants of atherosclerosis.
Carotid intima–media thickness (IMT) allows noninvasive
quantification of the early development of atherosclerosis.5 It
is an important predictor of later life cardiovascular events in
adults6,7 and reflects the burden of atherosclerosis at
autopsy.8 Traditional risk factors such as hyperlipidemia and
hypertension are cross-sectionally associated with thicker
carotid IMT in both adults and children,5 and childhood risk
factors predict adult carotid IMT in longitudinal studies.9
Lower SEP is cross-sectionally associated with thicker
carotid IMT in adults,10–13 and evidence suggests that this
association may already be apparent in adolescence.14 Most
studies in younger people are limited by modest sample sizes
with wide age ranges, leading to potential confounding, for
example,
by
pubertal
stage.
Moreover,
the
distinction
between family SEP and neighborhood SEP is often over-
looked,15 and few studies have assessed both measures
longitudinally in the same study.
To address these knowledge gaps, we analyzed data from
the Child Heath CheckPoint (CheckPoint), nested within the
Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC), to investi-
gate whether and when in the life course lower family or
neighborhood SEP measures were associated with thicker
carotid IMT at ages 11 to 12 years.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
In LSAC, 5107 healthy infants were randomly recruited in
2004 at 0 to 1 year of age as a nationally representative birth
cohort. Children were followed up biennially in “waves” of
data collection, collecting anthropometric, cognitive, and
detailed sociodemographic questionnaire data. The response
rate to the initial mailed invitation in 2004 was 57.2%, of
which 73.7% (n=3764) were retained for LSAC wave 6 in 2014
(at ages 10–11 years). All contactable and consenting LSAC
birth cohort families were then invited to participate in
CheckPoint (n=3513), a cross-sectional biophysical markers
wave nested between LSAC waves 6 and 7. Overall, 1875
families participated in CheckPoint throughout Australia, and
1874 families gave informed consent for use of their collected
data.
Ethics and inclusion criteria
CheckPoint data collection occurred in 2015 immediately
after LSAC wave 6, when the children were age 11 to
12 years, and was approved by the Royal Children’s Hospital
(Melbourne, Australia) human research ethics committee
(33225D) and the Australian Institute of Family Studies
ethics
committee
(14-26).
Participating
families
were
included in the current analyses if SEP data from LSAC
wave 6 and carotid IMT data from CheckPoint were available
(Figure 1).
Procedures
Assessors collected data on residential postcode, parental
income, education and occupation, height, weight, and
puberty through parent and child questionnaires in biennial
home visits from 2004 (wave 1) to 2014 (wave 6). Carotid
IMT, lumen diameter, height, weight, and puberty status were
also collected in 2015 at a specialized CheckPoint assess-
ment center visit. Those families who could not arrange a visit
were given the option of a home visit, at which some
measures such as carotid IMT were not obtained.
Socioeconomic Position
Both neighborhood SEP and family SEP were measured in
LSAC wave 6, �12 months before measurement of biophys-
ical measures in CheckPoint (range: �4 to 20 months). In
addition,
we
included
longitudinal
SEP
measures
from
preceding LSAC waves 1 to 5 (ages 0–9 years).
Neighborhood SEP
A Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) score of the
postcode region where the participating family lived was used
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• We present the first evidence that socioeconomic position,
no matter when measured across the first decade of life, is
associated with carotid intima–media thickness at ages 11
to 12 years.
• Children in the lowest socioeconomic quartile at 11 to
12 years of age were 46% more likely to have a carotid
intima–media thickness >75th percentile—this corresponds
to a vascular age >8 years older than their 50th-percentile
counterparts.
• The association is independent of age, sex, puberty, and
traditional risk factors such as body mass index, blood
pressure, and passive smoking exposure.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Family, rather than neighborhood, socioeconomic position
in the first 10 years of life may be an important indicator of
early subclinical atherosclerosis.
• The long-term implications of increased intima–media
thickness at ages 11 to 12 years need to be confirmed.
• Carotid ultrasound may be a useful component of pediatric
cardiovascular risk assessment.

 as a measure of neighborhood SEP. The SEIFA Index of
Relative Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage score
was a standardized score by geographic area compiled from
census data to numerically summarize the social and
economic conditions of Australian neighborhoods. It had a
national mean of 1000 and a standard deviation of 100, where
higher values represent more advantage and less disadvan-
tage.16
Family SEP
We used a previously constructed composite measure for
family SEP analyses.17 This SEP variable summarized parent-
reported combined household income, current or most recent
occupation of each parent, and highest achieved educational
qualification of each parent. Each component of the score was
scaled, and an unweighted average was calculated over 3
values in a single-parent household or over 5 values in a dual-

 parent household. The unweighted average variable at each
LSAC wave was then standardized within the wave to have a
mean of 0 and SD of 1. Our main analyses used LSAC wave 6
(ages 10–11 years) family SEP.
Parental education
We defined parental education as the highest education
achieved by either parent, based on the LSAC wave 6 parental
questionnaires. Parental education was categorized into 5
groups a priori according to classifications previously used in
LSAC analyses18: tertiary educated, completed high school
(year 12) and a certificate/diploma, completed year 12 only,
completed less than year 12 and a certificate/diploma, and
completed less than year 12 only. For sensitivity analyses, we
also collapsed the categories into those who completed tertiary
education, completed high school only, and completed neither.
Parental occupational status
We defined parental occupation as the most skillful occupa-
tion held by either parent, coded according to Australian and
New
Zealand
Standard
Classification
of
Occupations
(ANZSCO).19 Using data from LSAC wave 6 parental ques-
tionnaires, we categorized a priori highest parental occupation
into 4 main categories, dependent on the occupation’s
required skill level. The categories included (1) manager or
professional; (2) technician, tradesperson, community or
personal service staff; (3) clerical or sales staff; and (4)
machinery operator, driver, or laborer. We also matched
ANZSCO 2-digit codes to the Australian Socioeconomic Index
2006 (AUSEI06) occupational scores for sensitivity analy-
ses.20 This provided a continuous numerical measure of
occupation-based SEP as an alternative way of arranging the
occupations in order of skill requirement in finer detail.
Household income
Singly imputed self-reported weekly income of each parent and
other sources, derived from LSAC data, was used as a measure
of combined household income.21 In the technical papers
outlining the imputation process, the modified variables were
considered more representative of the overall sample and more
appropriate for analysis; their routine use over complete case
analysis was recommended.21 We subsequently divided the
combined household income by the square root of the number
of family members in the household to obtain an equivalized
household income that accounted for family size.
Carotid IMT
Carotid artery images were acquired using standardized
protocols developed in accordance with recommendations
of the American Society of Echocardiography and Mannheim
Consensus statements.22,23 All participants lay supine with
their head turned 45° to the left to expose the right side of
neck. The right carotid artery was chosen to harmonize with
other vascular measures taken in the same assessment, such
as pulse wave velocity, which also assessed the right-sided
circulation. Ultrasound images were obtained using a 10-MHz
linear array probe (Vivid I; GE Healthcare). Real-time B-mode
ultrasound cine loops were captured in triplicate by 1 of 4
trained technicians. Modified 3-lead ECG captured cardiac-
cycle information concurrently.
Images were transferred to digital storage and assessed by
1 technician, who selected the single best cine loop of 5 to 6
cardiac cycles. These loops were further processed using
Carotid Analyzer (Medical Imaging Applications), a commer-
cially available semiautomatic edge-detection software pro-
gram. IMT was measured �10 mm proximal to the carotid
bulb, over a distance of 5 to 10 mm.
Mean, maximum, and higher risk IMT
Carotid IMT values are presented as the mean of 3 to 5 still
frames of IMT captured at end-diastole. We used both mean
carotid IMT measurements, which referred to the average
from 3- to 5- frames of the entire carotid IMT measurement
over the 5- to 10-mm section, and maximum carotid IMT,
which referred to the 3- to 5-frame mean of the thickest
carotid IMT measurement over the 5- to 10-mm section.
Six trained raters measured all cine loops. Training
consisted of 30 example cine loops that were subsequently
assessed for consistency by an expert rater (R.S.L.). We
assessed protocol drift and reliability between raters by
randomly reanalyzing a subset of 105 images in quadrupli-
cate. Inter- and intrarater reliability of the carotid IMT
measurement was good and comparable to other published
results.24 The within-observer coefficients of variation were
6.5% and 4.9% for mean and maximum carotid IMT values,
respectively, and the between-observer coefficients of varia-
tion were 9.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Within-observer
intraclass correlations were 0.71 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.63–0.78) and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.54–0.71), respectively.
Between-observer intraclass correlations were 0.64 (95% CI,
0.54–0.74) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.49–0.68).
To provide clinical context for our findings, carotid IMT
measurements >75th percentile in our sample were catego-
rized as higher risk carotid IMT for both mean and maximum
carotid IMT measurements.

 assessment. Sex and pubertal stage were determined by self-
report in questionnaires. Participants were categorized into
prepubertal, early pubertal, midpubertal, late pubertal, and
postpubertal stages using the Pubertal Development Scale.25
Anthropometry
Using a portable stadiometer, participant height was mea-
sured without shoes, in light clothing, and in duplicate, to the
nearest 0.1 cm. A third measurement was taken if the
difference of the first 2 height measurements was >0.5 cm;
final height was the mean of all measurements made. Weight,
to the nearest 0.1 kg, was measured with an InBody230
bioelectrical impedance analysis scale. An age- and sex-
adjusted body mass index z score was calculated using the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth
reference charts.26
Blood pressure
Blood pressure was measured using a SphygmoCor XCEL
system (AtCor Medical Pty Ltd). Preceded by 7 minutes in
supine position at rest, systolic and diastolic blood pressures
were measured at the brachial artery up to 3 times. The mean
values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure were used
(shown as SBP and DBP, respectively) in the following
equation to derive an estimated mean arterial pressure
(shown as MAP):
MAP ¼ DBP þ 1
3 ðSBP � DBPÞ
Smoking at home and other demographics
In a written questionnaire at each LSAC wave, parents
reported the number of smokers at home. We created a binary
variable of “ever exposed to passive smoke” from these data;
it was positive for the child if the answer to the smokers-at-
home question in any LSAC wave (ages 0–11 years) was >0.
Details of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status and
whether other languages were spoken at home were collected
from parent report at wave 1 and used as binary variables in
analysis.
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.1
(StataCorp LP). Quartiles were based on the analytic sample
(n=1477). We addressed the first aim of our study by
constructing linear regression models using carotid IMT as the
outcome. Both neighborhood SEP and family SEP from LSAC
wave 6 were used as categorical variables split at sample
derived quartiles. The exposure variable was modeled both
linearly, assuming each quartile increment would have the
same magnitude of effect, and categorically in comparison to
the baseline lowest quartile group. Covariates were selected a
priori to be included in adjusted models. Additional adjust-
ment for both neighborhood and family SEP in the same
model was performed to examine which variable explained
more of the variance in carotid IMT.
We subsequently explored the components of family SEP
using categorical SEP variables in linear regression models.
Covariates were selected a priori to be included in adjusted
models, and adjustment for each SEP component was
undertaken in the further adjusted model.
We used modified Poisson regression models27 to estimate
the relative risk of having a higher risk carotid IMT between
exposure quartiles of family and neighborhood SEP and
components of family SEP.
Equivalent neighborhood and family SEP variables col-
lected in previous study waves were used as categorical
variables in analyses replicating the first aim to address
whether time of measurement of SEP was relevant. Each
model included the carotid IMT outcome at CheckPoint, with
SEP exposure at the single time point of each previous wave.
We used multiple imputation with the method of chained
equations28 to generate plausible values for missing data to
recover information from incomplete cases and to reduce
potential biases introduced by complete case analysis.
Imputation was conducted for all variables with missing data
(Table 1), and results were compared with complete case
analysis. The imputation model included all analytic variables
as well as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status and
whether a language other than English was spoken at home.
Twenty data sets were imputed, and analyses were performed
using the mi set of commands in Stata. Results with and
without imputation were comparable; we chose to present
complete case analyses as our main results and included any
notable differences from imputation in our description of
these sensitivity analyses.
Results
Characteristics of the Study Participants
We collected SEP data and child carotid IMT measurements
from 1477 families (79% of the total CheckPoint cohort;
Figure 1). In attrition analyses, the present cohort had higher
family and neighborhood SEP compared with those who did
not undertake carotid IMT measurements in the latest follow-
up and those who did not participate in the follow-up
(Table 2).29 The sample mean family SEP was 0.24 SD above
the mean SEP of all families at LSAC wave 6 and 0.37 SD
above the mean SEP of all 5107 families enrolled in LSAC. The
Pearson correlation coefficient between family and neighbor-
hood SEP at LSAC wave 6 was 0.37.

 The study sample trends of family SEP are outlined in
Table 3. Gradients across family SEP quartiles (with a
consistent increase or decrease in mean values per quartile)
were observed in Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status,
passive smoking exposure, child weight, blood pressure, and
pubertal development. The mean–mean and mean–maximum
carotid IMTs were 497 lm (SD 59 lm) and 581 lm (47 lm),
respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient between
mean and maximum carotid IMT was 0.76.
Family and Neighborhood SEP
There was evidence of a cross-sectional association between
both family and neighborhood SEP with maximum carotid IMT
but not with mean carotid IMT (Table 4). When SEP was
treated as a categorical variable, the difference in maximum
carotid IMT between the highest and lowest quartiles of
family SEP measured at ages 10 to 11 years was 10.7 lm
(95% CI, 3.4–18.0; P=0.004) in linear regression models
adjusted for age, sex, body mass index z score, mean arterial
blood pressure, pubertal category, minimal intima–intima
lumen diameter, and exposure to passive smoking. In Table 4
(and for P-value calculations in Figure 2), SEP was used as a
quasicontinuous variable with results presented per unit
increment of SEP quartile to observe linear trends across the
whole sample. In univariable analyses, each quartile incre-
ment higher of family SEP was associated with a 3.7-lm
thicker carotid IMT (95% CI, 1.6–5.8; P=0.001); the equiva-
lent neighborhood SEP quartile increment was associated
with a 2.6-lm thicker carotid IMT (95% CI, 0.4–4.8; P=0.02).
In multivariable analysis including both SEP variables and
previously mentioned covariates, the association between
family SEP and maximum carotid IMT remained statistically
significant (model 3, b=3.0; 95% CI, 0.6–5.4; P=0.02),
whereas
the
neighborhood
SEP
association
attenuated
toward the null hypothesis (b=1.2; 95% CI, �1.3 to 3.6;
P=0.34).
In longitudinal analysis of data gathered in 2-year intervals
since ages 0 to 1 year, family SEP was consistently associ-
ated with maximum carotid IMT measured at ages 11 to
12 years. This was evident even when SEP was measured in
infancy (Figure 2). When family SEP was treated as a
categorical variable in a multivariable regression model, the
difference in maximum carotid IMT between the highest and
lowest quartiles of family SEP measured at ages 2 to 3 years
was 8.5 lm (95% CI, 1.3–15.8; P=0.02). The per-quartile
increment when family SEP was modeled linearly was 3.1 lm
(95% CI, 0.8–5.4; P=0.008). Similarly, consistent longitudinal
patterns were also observed between neighborhood SEP and
maximum carotid IMT (Figure 3).
It is important to note that correlation in SEP variables
between LSAC waves was substantial. Pearson correlation
coefficients between SEP measures in LSAC waves 1 to 6
ranged from 0.76 to 0.90 for family SEP and 0.56 to 0.93 for
neighborhood SEP. The Pearson correlation coefficients
between neighborhood and family SEP at each LSAC wave
ranged from 0.32 to 0.37.
Household Income, Parental Occupation, and
Parental Education
In unadjusted linear regression analyses, all 3 component
variables that make up family SEP—household income,
highest parental education, and highest parental occupation
at child ages 10 to 11 years—were associated with the
continuous measure of maximum carotid IMT at ages 11 to
12 years (Table 5). In multivariable analyses including age,
sex, body mass index z score, mean arterial blood pressure,
pubertal category, minimal intima–intima lumen diameter, and
exposure to passive smoking as covariates, the associations
between equivalized household income and highest parental
occupation with maximum carotid IMT remained statistically
significant (P≤0.05). None of the component SEP variables

 was associated with maximum carotid IMT when all compo-
nents were included in the same model, suggesting substan-
tial collinearity between different measures of family SEP.
Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.46, 0.31, and 0.32
between highest parental education and occupation, between
highest
parental
occupation
and
equivalized
household
income, and between highest parental education and equiv-
alized household income, respectively.
Carotid IMT >75th Percentile
In modified Poisson regression analyses, family SEP was
inversely associated with higher risk (>75th percentile)
maximum carotid IMT (Table 6). Relative risks of similar
magnitude were observed with occupation category, educa-
tion, and income quartiles in adjusted analyses (Table 6). The
relative risk for higher risk carotid IMT in the lowest SEP
quartile compared with the highest SEP quartile was 1.41 (95%
CI, 1.09–1.82; P=0.008) when measured at 10 to 11 years of
age and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.10–1.86; P=0.008) when measured at
2 to 3 years of age, in unadjusted models. These associations
were not attenuated in multivariable models (Table 6).
Sensitivity Analyses
Analyses using imputed data in linear regression models gave
results similar to those presented. Analyses using imputed
data in modified Poisson regression models provided esti-
mates with wider confidence intervals, which attenuated
previously significant associations; however, the magnitude
and direction of the point estimates remained similar.
In further separate analyses, we recategorized parental
education into 3 groups and rescored parental occupation
according to an alternative occupational ranking scale
(AUSEI06). In a final sensitivity analysis, we included birth
weight z scores to account for some potential postnatal
factors. The results from these sensitivity analyses were
similar to those presented.
Discussion
We provide the first evidence that the association between
lower family SEP and subclinical atherosclerosis is already
present in mid-childhood. These findings are in keeping with
the social gradients of traditional risk factors causally
implicated in CVD pathogenesis, such as hypertension30 and
obesity.31 The association between family SEP and carotid
IMT was only mildly attenuated when accounting for neigh-
borhood SEP and possible confounders and mediators, such
as adiposity, blood pressure, and passive smoking exposure.
In addition, longitudinal analyses suggest that SEP measured
as early as ages 2 to 3 years is associated with subsequent
subclinical atherosclerosis.

Regression coefficients are expressed as the lm difference in carotid IMT per quartile lower in SEP measure. Model 1 models were adjusted for age and sex, Model 2 for age, sex, body mass
index z score, mean arterial blood pressure, pubertal category, minimal intima-intima lumen diameter and exposure to passive smoking. The final Model 3 included both family and neighborhood
SEP in the same model, along with all other covariates used in Model 2. Family SEP is a composite measure, standardized within each LSAC wave, summarizing parental education, occupation
and household income. Neighborhood SEP uses Australian census-derived data to generate a Socioeconomic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA) advantage/disadvantage score, according to family
residential address postcode. CI indicates confidence interval; IMT, intima-media thickness, LSAC, Longitudinal Study of Australian Children; SEP, socioeconomic position.

SEP and Carotid IMT in Childhood
Liu et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 4, 2019
 To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the
association between early life SEP and a widely used marker
of subclinical atherosclerosis in mid-childhood. Previous
studies have reported that carotid IMT differs according to
SEP in adults10–13 and adolescents.14,32 We provide evidence
that lower SEP in very early childhood, and repeated
measures of SEP throughout childhood, are associated with
increased IMT at midchildhood. The absolute magnitude of the
association is small—an effect size of 0.23 and 0.12 SD
between highest and lowest family and neighborhood SEP
quartiles, respectively, in cross-sectional analyses—however,
the association is consistent across different measures and
components of SEP. Children in the lowest family SEP quartile
have a 46% greater relative risk of having a maximum carotid
IMT in the higher risk category, corresponding to an estimated
vascular age at least 8 years older than their chronological
age, according to published data on adolescent reference
values.24 Such a trajectory persisting unchecked into adult-
hood may have clinical implications. Adults with carotid IMT in
the top quartile (or evidence of carotid plaque) would have
approximately twice the hazard for CVD, myocardial infarc-
tion, or stroke compared with counterparts with “normal”
carotid IMT.33
Our study indicates that in children, family SEP and
neighborhood SEP were associated with maximum carotid IMT
but not with mean IMT. Maximum IMT has been suggested to
be more relevant to cardiovascular risk7 and describes the
nature of focal thickening of the intima–media early in the life
course better than mean measures.34,35 Prior studies among
children have suggested using maximum carotid IMT mea-
surements,34,36 despite mean and maximum carotid IMT
correlating strongly (r=0.76 in our cohort). A plausible
explanation for different findings between mean and maxi-
mum carotid IMT is that the superior reproducibility of
maximum IMT allowed an association to be detected, whereas
noise in mean IMT measurement attenuated a true signal.
Regardless, the mean carotid IMT regression estimates,
although not statistically significant (P≤0.05), are consistent
with the maximum carotid IMT estimates in direction and

 magnitude (Table 4). This adds weight to our overall conclu-
sion that evidence shows a social gradient in carotid IMT
measurement at 11 to 12 years of age.
Differences in associations with maximum carotid IMT
between neighborhood and family SEP warrant further
investigation. In our cohort, both measures were associated
with IMT when analyzed separately, whereas family SEP
seemed to have stronger explanatory power when analyzed
simultaneously with neighborhood SEP. We suggest that
family factors, for example, shared genetics and household
environment, may be more important than neighborhood
factors in the development of subclinical atherosclerosis. This
is supported by recent evidence suggesting the causal
pathways between neighborhood SEP and CVD involve SEP
trends within individuals rather than the availability of
resources.37 Further breakdown of the family SEP variable
did not reveal clear differences in associations between
carotid IMT and highest parental education, occupation, or
household income (Table 5).
Further work is required to examine detailed mechanisms
for the observed associations between SEP and carotid IMT.
An association measurable by at least ages 2 to 3 years
implies that early life heritable and/or environmental factors
are likely to contribute. Their relative contribution and
pathogenic mechanisms cannot be determined in the present
study. CheckPoint did not have IMT measures from birth, but
future studies could address whether associations between
SEP and aortic IMT exist from birth. It is conceivable that
differences may already exist in utero. Indeed, increased fatty
streak formation has been observed in pregnancies of
mothers with hypercholesterolemia.38 It is generally accepted
that fetal environment partially determines cardiovascular
risk,39 and this could partly represent intergenerational
cellular memory mediated via epigenetic phenomena40 such
as global hypermethylation of DNA secondary to chronic
inflammation.41
Differential postnatal exposure to modifiable risk factors
such as obesity, elevated blood pressure, and smoking over
the life course are likely mechanisms by which SEP worsens
atherosclerosis and increases risk for CVD.42–45 Many of
these exposures are initiated in childhood and adolescence,
setting individuals on worse health trajectories later in life. It
is plausible that early socioeconomic differences influence
these risk factors, culminating in detectable changes in
carotid IMT. Our sample demonstrated clear socioeconomic
gradients in body mass index, blood pressure, and passive

Regression coefficients are expressed as the lm difference in carotid IMT per category or quartile lower in SEP measure. Model 1 models we adjusted for age and sex, Model 2 for age, sex,
body mass index z score, mean arterial blood pressure, pubertal category, minimal intima-intima lumen diameter, exposure to passive smoking, and neighborhood SEP. The final Model 3
included all components of family SEP in the same model, along with covariates used in Model 2. Family SEP is a composite measure, standardized within each LSAC Wave, summarizing
parental education, occupation and household income. Neighborhood SEP uses Australian census-derived data to generate a Socioeconomic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA) advantage/
disadvantage score, according to family residential address postcode. CI indicates confidence interval; IMT, intima-media thickness, LSAC, Longitudinal Study of Australian Children; SEP,

 smoking
exposure
(Table 3);
however,
the
association
between SEP and IMT was independent of these factors.
Other risk factors such as lipid profile, physical activity, and
diet were not examined in this study, but it is unlikely that the
present findings would be entirely attenuated by adjustment
for these factors.46 In a comparative analysis of adult data,
health behaviors accounted for socioeconomic differences in
mortality only when the behaviors themselves were similarly
patterned,45 suggesting that diet and physical activity are only
a subset of potential mechanisms through which SEP affects
health. Novel, nontraditional risk factors, such as increased
childhood inflammatory burden, may contribute to the
association between low SEP and atherosclerosis.47 Further
detailed analyses of the intermediate pathways by which SEP
influences early carotid IMT are warranted.
A number of limitations of our study warrant further
consideration. The clinical consequences of increased carotid
IMT in mid-childhood are unknown. Associations between
exposures such as obesity and cardiovascular risk may be
modified in adolescence and early adulthood. Obese children
who become thin adults, for example, have cardiovascular risk
similar to those who were never obese.48 Data from ongoing
studies measuring carotid IMT since young adulthood, such as
those from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study, may

SEP and Carotid IMT in Childhood

 provide informative answers in the next decade,49 but
withholding recommendations until longitudinal follow-up of
disease seems untenable in the context of the childhood
obesity epidemic. Further studies are required to understand
the relationship between childhood and adult IMT and the risk
of
CVD.
Investigation
of
other
markers
of
subclinical
atherosclerosis, such as arterial distensibility and elasticity,
or markers of microcirculation arteriosclerosis may be
informative.
The CheckPoint sample is derived from an Australian
population, limiting the generalizability of our conclusions to
other ethnicities or cultural contexts. Sample characteristics
such as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status or speaking
a language other than English at home did not substantially
predict IMT, but the low proportion of these families in the
sample meant that this study was not adequately powered to
observe differences. Ethnic differences in carotid IMT50 may
explain family SEP gradients in some contexts51; however, no
evidence in the CheckPoint sample showed that ethnicity is a
driving factor. Future studies comparing ethnically diverse
groups including the Aboriginal population may provide
further insight into this relationship. Moreover, the moderate
response rate itself reduced the generalizability of our findings
and introduced potential for selection bias. In particular,
excluded participants had lower SEP than participants of the
CheckPoint study overall; CheckPoint participants were
relatively advantaged. The national mean for neighborhood
SEP, for example, is set at 1000 (SD 100), and the lowest
quartile of our sample had a mean of 1004 (SD 68). Across
the wider national cohort, the carotid IMT differences are
likely to be considerably greater; the undersampling of lower
SEP families indicates the reported regression coefficients
likely underestimate an association. The corollary is that even
in this selective sample of advantaged families, evidence
shows a family SEP gradient in carotid IMT.
Given the lack of clinical recommendations in children, we
used published adult consensus statements to choose the
75th percentile cutoff point; this is used to indicate higher risk
carotid IMT in adults22 and has been endorsed by the
Association for European Pediatric Cardiology as a cutoff for
abnormal IMT at younger ages.52 Nevertheless, this sample-
defined dichotomization should be interpreted with caution
because it may not reflect the underlying population at the
75th percentile. If our sample were healthier than the general
population, the 75th percentile cutoff would be at a lower
level that inaccurately reflects underlying pathology. Longitu-
dinal follow-up is necessary to demonstrate the clinical
relevance of this cutoff point.
We observed that SEP evaluated throughout childhood was
associated with maximum carotid IMT at ages 11 to 12 years.
Because SEP levels in early childhood are highly correlated
with midchildhood SEP, it is difficult to know whether early
childhood SEP per se is associated with IMT later in childhood
or whether the finding is due to strong tracking of SEP.
Finally, our analyses are limited to the right carotid artery.
A number of studies report an average of both arteries,
whereas some studies report results from only the right
artery.53 Some evidence suggests that left and right arteries
have different IMTs; atherosclerosis tends to be more
advanced in the left carotid artery compared with the right,54
possibly because of differences in left and right cerebral
circulations. Even if the left carotid artery were thicker than
the right by midchildhood, by measuring only 1 side, we were
unlikely to introduce systematic biases.
In conclusion, we present evidence that family SEP and
neighborhood SEP are associated with a marker of subclinical
atherosclerosis by early childhood, independent of age, sex,
puberty, passive smoking exposure, blood pressure, body size,
and neighborhood SEP. Consistent evidence showed an
association between SEP from early life and midchildhood
carotid IMT. Future investigation should focus on how
household factors influence early life health behaviors as
potential mechanisms by which SEP alters early life trajec-
tories of cardiovascular risk.
