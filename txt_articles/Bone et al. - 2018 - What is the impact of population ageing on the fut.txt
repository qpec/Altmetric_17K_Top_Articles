Abstract
Background: Population ageing represents a global challenge for future end-of-life care. Given new trends in place of death, it is vital 
to examine where the rising number of deaths will occur in future years and implications for health and social care.
Aim: To project where people will die from 2015 to 2040 across all care settings in England and Wales.
Design: Population-based trend analysis and projections using simple linear modelling. Age- and gender-specific proportions of deaths 
in hospital, care home, home, hospice and ‘other’ were applied to numbers of expected future deaths.
Setting/population: All deaths (2004–2014) from death registration data and predicted deaths (2015–2040) from official population 
forecasts in England and Wales.
Results: Annual deaths are projected to increase from 501,424 in 2014 (38.8% aged 85 
years and over) to 635,814 in 2040 (53.6% 
aged 85 
years and over). Between 2004 and 2014, proportions of home and care home deaths increased (18.3%–22.9% and 16.7%– 
21.2%) while hospital deaths declined (57.9%–48.1%). If current trends continue, numbers of deaths in care homes and homes will 
increase by 108.1% and 88.6%, with care home the most common place of death by 2040. If care home capacity does not expand and 
additional deaths occur in hospital, hospital deaths will start rising by 2023.
Conclusion: To sustain current trends, end-of-life care provision in care homes and the community needs to double by 2040. An 
infrastructure across care settings that supports rising annual deaths is urgently needed; otherwise, hospital deaths will increase.

Original Article
What is already known about the topic?
•
•
Population ageing is a global phenomenon with challenges for the future provision of health and social care.
•
•
The majority of people prefer to die in their usual place of care.
•
•
There has been a recent rise in the number of deaths at home and fall in deaths in hospital.
What this paper adds?
•
•
If the recent decline in hospital deaths is sustained, by 2040 the annual numbers of people dying at home and in care homes 
will almost double and care home will become the most common place of death.
•
•
If there is no expansion of capacity and end-of-life care training for staff in care homes and in home care services, the trend 
in declining hospital deaths will likely reverse by 2023.

Introduction
The numbers of deaths worldwide are set to rise from 
57 million in 2015 to 70 million in the next 15 years.1 
People are living to older ages, and patterns of death and 
disease are changing. Non-communicable diseases 
accounted for over two-thirds of all global deaths in 20122 
and their prevalence is expected to increase in the future.3 
As in other rapidly ageing nations, the impact of popula-
tion ageing in England and Wales will become increas-
ingly evident in the next few decades. There is an urgent 
need to plan ahead to ensure we meet the healthcare needs 
of our population in the future.
A robust understanding of where people die is vital to 
support health policies, resource allocation and service 
delivery, for example, to support the planning and com-
missioning of palliative care services. Place of death is 
considered a marker of quality, because it is related to 
quality of life and bereavement outcomes.4,5 It also indi-
cates the extent to which care meets people’s prefer-
ences at the end of life, since most people prefer to die 
at home or in their usual place of living and care.6 
Knowledge of where people are likely to die is an 
important indicator of where pressures in the health sys-
tem may occur in future years. It also points to priority 
areas for education and training to ensure our current 
and future workforce can provide care that enables peo-
ple with advanced conditions to live well and die peace-
fully where they wish to be.
A previous study by Gomes and Higginson7 projected 
future trends in home and institutional deaths from 2004 to 
2030 in England and Wales, based on trends from 1999 to 
2003. This study guided subsequent end-of-life care poli-
cies, such as the End of Life Care Strategy (2008),8 which 
successfully raised the profile of end-of-life care and influ-
enced practice.9 The long-standing trend of declining 
home deaths described by Gomes and Higginson7 has sub-
sequently slowed and even reversed.10,11 Alongside these 
policy changes and new trends in place of death, popula-
tion ageing has increased.12 Thus, it is timely and vital to 
provide new projections of where people will die in the 
future to inform health and social care policy and 
 
planning. This study builds on the work by Gomes 
 
and Higginson by extending the projections by 10 years 
and examining settings that are important providers of 
end-of-life care but not previously explored, namely care 
homes and hospices. This study aims to project where peo-
ple in England and Wales will die from 2015 to 2040 
across all care settings and examine implications for end-
of-life care provision.
Methods
Design
Population-based trend analysis using simple linear mod-
elling and explicit assumptions to project where people 
will die in England and Wales based on recent death regis-
tration data (2004–2014).
Data sources
We used publicly available datasets provided by the Office 
for National Statistics (ONS). First, the ONS supplied 
death registration data on all registered deaths by place of 
occurrence in England and Wales from 2004 to 2014.12,13 
Second, mid-year forecasts for future population and 
deaths in England and Wales were obtained.14
Place of death data. Our primary outcome was place of 
death. Death registration is a legal requirement and a 
widely recognised and accepted data source for measuring 
place of death.11,15 Death registration data in England and 
Wales is considered to be of high quality.16 We were sup-
plied with anonymous information for all deaths registered 
within each calendar year between 2004 and 2014. We 
used place of death categories defined according to a 
revised classification (2010; applied retrospectively to 
years 2004–2009 by the ONS on request): (1) home, 
(2) care home (local authority and non-local authority), 
(3) hospital (National Health Service (NHS) and non-
NHS), (4) hospice, (5) other communal establishments and 
(6) elsewhere. Deaths at home were those at the usual resi-
dence of the deceased, where this was not a communal 
establishment. ‘Other communal establishments’ included 
schools, hotels and prisons, while ‘elsewhere’ referred to 
motorways, the street and other public spaces. We com-
bined the categories ‘other communal establishments’ and

‘elsewhere’, referred to as ‘other’ hereafter. Place of death 
information was provided by the informant of death, who 
is usually a relative of the deceased. All data were strati-
fied by age and gender, using the seven ONS standard age 
groups (up to 4, 5–14, 15–44, 45–64, 65–74, 75–84, 85 
and over years). The first three categories were collapsed 
for presentation of findings.
Forecast population data. The ONS provides several popu-
lation forecasts using estimates of mid-year population, 
according to a range of explicit assumptions about future 
fertility, life expectancy and migration patterns. Forecast 
deaths are provided for each age year and by gender. We 
used the ‘principal’ forecasts as it is widely used by local 
authorities and commissioners for resource allocation and 
planning. Methods for forecasts are provided elsewhere.17
Data analysis
We projected place of death for all deaths forecast to occur 
in England and Wales up to 2040 using age- and gender-
specific proportions in each place of death from 2004 to 
2014 and applying these to the age- and gender-specific 
numbers of future deaths forecast by ONS. Where pro-
jected numbers became negative (for categories that had a 
small number of deaths), we fixed the value at zero. We 
produced three projection scenarios with explicit assump-
tions. For each scenario, the total number of projected 
deaths across all care settings was compared against the 
total number of forecast deaths provided by the ONS to 
examine the margin of error. All analyses were conducted 
in Excel.
Scenario 1 assumed that the proportions of deaths 
occurring in each care setting in 2014 will remain 
unchanged over time. The age- and gender-specific pro-
portions in each place of death for 2014 were applied to the 
forecast numbers of deaths in each consecutive year until 
2040 to obtain the projected number of deaths occurring in 
each care setting. Scenario 2 assumed that the average 
trend in place of death in the last 11 years (2004–2014) will 
continue linearly until 2040. For this scenario, we calcu-
lated annual percentage changes in age- and gender-spe-
cific proportions of deaths for each of the five care setting 
categories separately. Mean annual percentage changes in 
the 11 year period were assumed to continue for each sub-
sequent year and these proportions were applied to the age 
and gender distribution of the forecast deaths in future 
years.
Scenario 3 followed the same assumptions as Scenario 
2; however, it additionally assumed that the maximum 
capacity of care homes was reached in 2014. It was 
assumed that the absolute number of deaths that are to 
occur in care homes in the future could not exceed those 
observed in 2014. This scenario was explored as there 
have been a number of care home closures in recent 
years.18 People admitted to care homes have complex 
needs with a combination of disability, frailty, multiple 
long-term 
conditions 
and 
cognitive 
impairment.19 
Therefore, any additional deaths were assumed to occur in 
hospital and so were subtracted from the care home cate-
gory and added to the hospital category in each future year.
Ethics
This study uses routinely collected aggregated and 
anonymised data that are publicly available; therefore, no 
ethical approvals were necessary.
Results
Recent trends in place of death
The previously reported trends in place of death in England 
and Wales from 2004 to 2010 have since continued in the 
same direction (Table 1 and Figure A in supplementary 
material). Between 2004 and 2014, there have been 
increases in the proportion of deaths occurring at home 
and in care homes (18.3%–22.9% and 16.7%–21.2%, 
respectively). Hospice deaths also increased slightly but 
remained the place of death for a small minority (4.6% in 
2004 to 5.5% in 2014). In contrast to community-based 
deaths, the proportion of hospital deaths declined during 
the 11-year period (57.9%–48.1%) and fell below 50% in 
2012, meaning that the majority of people no longer die in 
hospital. Deaths elsewhere declined from 2.5% to 2.3% 
between 2004 and 2014.
Projections of deaths by age and gender
The ONS projects that the population of England and 
Wales will increase from over 57 million in 2014 to over 
66 million in 2040 (16.4% increase). Figure 1 shows the 
projected numbers of deaths by age and gender. Overall, 
the number of deaths is projected to increase by 27.0% 
from 501,424 in 2014 to 635,814 in 2040. In 2014, 83.9% 
of all deaths occurred in people aged 65 years and over, 
and this is projected to increase to 90.9% in 2040. Most 
striking is the 75.3% increase in deaths for the 85 and over 
age group, with a higher increase for men within this age 
group (111.8% increase compared to 53.4% for women). 
In 2014, 38.8 % of all deaths occurred in people aged 
85 years and over, and this percentage is projected to 
increase to 53.6% in 2040.
Projections of deaths by place of occurrence
Figure 2 (and Table A in supplementary material) displays 
where people might die in future years according to the 
 332 
Palliative Medicine 32(2)
three scenarios. The margin of error for the total deaths in 
2040 projected using recent trends (Scenarios 2 and 3) 
compared with the ONS forecast total deaths was minimal 
at 0.17%. There was no margin of error for Scenario 1 due 
to the application of fixed proportions.
Scenario 1. As the age- and gender-specific proportions of 
deaths in each care setting are assumed to be static in Sce-
nario 1, the trends observed are driven by the projected 
demographic changes. In this scenario, the numbers of 
deaths in hospital are projected to increase over future 
years, even though the proportions remain the same. By 
2027, the number of people dying in care homes is pro-
jected to exceed the number of people dying at home. 
Unlike in other care settings, the number of people dying in 
hospices is projected to remain stable over time until 2040.
Scenario 2. Projections using the past 11-year average 
change (Scenario 2) show increasing home, care home and 
hospice deaths and decreasing hospital deaths (Tables B 
and C in supplementary material show findings by age and 
gender). According to this scenario, by 2040 68.6% of all 
deaths will occur in a care home or at home (220,952 and 
216,110 deaths, respectively), with about a third in each 
care setting (34.7% in care homes and 34.0% at home). 
Hospice deaths are projected to increase from 27,804 
(5.5%) in 2014 to 46,690 (7.3%) in 2040. While hospice 
would remain the place of death for a minority, care homes 
and home would both become more common settings for 
death than hospital by 2040, which is projected to decline 
from 241,335 deaths (48.1% of all deaths) in 2014 to 
142,543 deaths in 2040 (22.4% of all deaths).
Scenario 3. The third scenario illustrates the possible 
impact of care homes reaching capacity if additional care 
home deaths occur instead in hospital settings. In this sce-
nario, the number of deaths at home, in hospices and in 
other settings are the same as for Scenario 2. However, the 
pattern for hospital deaths looks markedly different if care 
home capacity does not increase beyond the level observed 
in 2014 (106,186 deaths). In this scenario, hospital deaths 
will continue to decline until 2023 when the trend reverses. 
By 2040, hospital deaths would have increased to 257,308 
(40.5%).

Discussion
Our projections show that if current trends continue, the 
need for end-of-life care will rise substantially over the 
next 25 years, particularly at home and in care homes. The 
recent trends of increasing deaths in usual place of care are 
in line with the population’s preferences,6,20,21 indicating 
an improvement in end-of-life care provision. If current 
trends continue, deaths in care homes, homes and hospices 
will almost double by 2040, which will account for 76.0% 
of all deaths. Care home deaths are projected to become 
the most common place of death by 2040. However, if care 
home capacity does not increase and these additional 
deaths instead occur in hospital, the decline in hospital 
deaths will reverse by 2023, rising to 40.5% of all deaths 
by 2040. New approaches to caring for people at the end of 
life will need to be considered. If people are to be sup-
ported to die outside hospital, input from the NHS, social

care and the voluntary sector as well as families and friends 
will be required. While these results relate to the popula-
tion of England and Wales, there are clear parallels with 
other nations experiencing similar patterns of population 
ageing in future decades.22
Our projections suggest that care homes will become 
increasingly important settings for end-of-life care, cor-
roborating findings from similar studies in Belgium and 
France.23,24 Therefore, new approaches to care homes 
must be considered and can be informed by alternative 
models seen elsewhere. For example, ‘nursing home med-
icine’, which is recognised as a medical speciality in the 
Netherlands,25 and the ‘teaching nursing home’ model 
developed in Australia.26 However, if care home capacity 
declines, it is likely that hospital deaths will rise, as has 
been observed in Portugal.27 It is concerning that there are 
many examples of care homes closing for economic rea-
sons. If the trend of declining hospital deaths reverses, 
there will also be a greater imperative to examine alterna-
tive models of hospital care, such as hospice wards and 
units within the hospital, which have been implemented in 
the United States28 and elsewhere.29
The rise in numbers of people dying in community set-
tings with complex care needs, such as those associated with 
multi-morbidity and frailty,30,31 present additional chal-
lenges for care provision. For example, palliative care need 
is projected to increase by 42% by 2040, increasing out of 
proportion to deaths.32 Palliative care delivered by special-
ists has been shown to improve outcomes for patients and 
family carers.33 However, only a minority of people receive 
specialist palliative care at the end of life,34 and access is 
more common for people with cancer compared to non- 
cancer conditions, despite similar needs.35,36 How to iden-
tify people who could benefit from palliative care37 and 
improve its coverage to an increasing target population in 
community settings is a key challenge of the next few 
 
decades. This requires improved integration of palliative 
care into primary care in future years.38 These are areas of 
research and clinical care that require urgent attention.
As the number of people needing end-of-life care rises, 
consideration of the resilience, capacity39 and training of 
the health and social care workforce is of growing impor-
tance, particularly in the community. If current trends con-
tinue and care homes become the most common place of 
death, it is vital that care home staff are adequately trained 
to deliver good quality care towards the end of life. While 
training in palliative care and end-of-life care is improving 
across health professions,40 it is variable and often inade-
quate.41 Palliative care and end-of-life care should be 
embedded into training curricula for all health profession-
als. New innovative partnership methods of delivering pal-
liative care training, particularly in community settings, are 
required. The ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare 
Outcomes) model of teleconferencing medical education 
and care management developed in the United States has 
been piloted in the palliative care setting in Northern 
Ireland, with positive early findings.42 Research to evaluate 
education and training programmes in palliative care and 
end-of-life care is needed to support best practice.
Strengths and limitations
This study provides new national projections for where 
people will die, using simple methods to provide clear and 
interpretable projections, not deterministic forecasts. 
Previous projections guided policy changes by warning 
about what would happen in the future, which in turn 
effected significant change in place of death. New projec-
tions are therefore timely. We expanded the analysis to 
include deaths in care homes and hospices, which are 
important settings for end-of-life care provision. This is a 
strength of this study, as there is interdependence between 
settings.43 There are however limitations relating to the 
assumptions made in the modelling. For Scenarios 2 and 3, 
we assumed linear change over time, which is an oversim-
plification, although recent trends do show approximately 
linear change over time. The assumption for Scenario 3 
that care homes reach capacity in 2014, and care home 
deaths cannot therefore increase, is also an oversimplifica-
tion. If length of stay prior to death reduces, then care 
home deaths could increase at constant bed capacity, as has 
been observed in Sweden.44 However, the expected growth 
in the older population living with long-term functional 
dependence45 means that it is reasonable to assume that 
care home duration is not likely to decrease in the future.
Despite trends of decreasing number of hospital deaths, 
hospital admission at the end of life is high and increases 
markedly at the end of life.46,47 Understanding the concurrent 
trends of planned and unplanned hospital use prior to the end 
of life is important in terms of resource use, and quality of 
end-of-life care, but was beyond the scope of this study. 
Evidence on the comparative quality of care between care 
settings is sparse, particularly for older people with non-can-
cer conditions,48 and this work does not shed light on this 
aspect. These are important considerations for planning the 
future delivery of end-of-life care for growing numbers and 
require further investigation. However, this study provides a 
clear population-based analysis model to be replicated in 
nations in which death registration data are routinely col-
lected and forecasts of future mortality are available.
Conclusion
These projections show that there will be substantial 
increases in deaths at home and in care homes over the next 
25 years, if current trends continue, putting significant pres-
sure on community services. If the reduction of deaths in 
hospital is to be sustained, there is an urgent need to expand 
the number of care home places and invest in community 
services and social care. If care home capacity does not

increase or alternative approaches developed, the projected 
reduction of deaths in hospital will reverse, and demands 
on hospitals to provide end-of-life care will escalate. An 
urgent policy decision and strategic response to these immi-
nent challenges is required to ensure that there is adequate 
infrastructure across settings to provide high quality care to 
people reaching the end of their life in future years.
