IMPORTANCE Drug development for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer has been
limited by a lack of clinically relevant trial end points short of overall survival (OS).
Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) as defined by the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials
Working Group 2 (PCWG2) is a candidate end point that represents a clinically meaningful
benefit to patients.
OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the robustness of the PCWG2 definition and to examine the
relationship between rPFS and OS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS PREVAIL was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled multinational study that enrolled 1717 chemotherapy-naive men with
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer from September 2010 through September
2012. The data were analyzed in November 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide 160 mg or placebo until
confirmed radiographic disease progression or a skeletal-related event and initiation of either
cytotoxic chemotherapy or an investigational agent for prostate cancer treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Sensitivity analyses (SAs) of investigator-assessed rPFS
were performed using the final rPFS data cutoff (May 6, 2012; 439 events; SA1) and the
interim OS data cutoff (September 16, 2013; 540 events; SA2). Additional SAs using
investigator-assessed rPFS from the final rPFS data cutoff assessed the impact of
skeletal-related events (SA3), clinical progression (SA4), a confirmatory scan for soft-tissue
disease progression (SA5), and all deaths regardless of time after study drug discontinuation
(SA6). Correlations between investigator-assessed rPFS (SA2) and OS were calculated using
Spearman ρ and Kendall τ via Clayton copula.
RESULTS In the 1717 men (mean age, 72.0 [range, 43.0-93.0] years in enzalutamide arm and
71.0 [range, 42.0-93.0] years in placebo arm), enzalutamide significantly reduced risk of
radiographic progression or death in all SAs, with hazard ratios of 0.22 (SA1; 95% CI,
0.18-0.27), 0.31 (SA2; 95% CI, 0.27-0.35), 0.21 (SA3; 95% CI, 0.18-0.26), 0.21 (SA4; 95% CI,
0.17-0.26), 0.23 (SA5; 95% CI, 0.19-0.30), and 0.23 (SA6; 95% CI, 0.19-0.30) (P < .001 for
all). Correlations of rPFS and OS in enzalutamide-treated patients were 0.89 (95% CI,
0.86-0.92) by Spearman ρ and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68-0.77) by Kendall τ.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Sensitivity analyses in PREVAIL demonstrated the robustness
of the PCWG2 rPFS definition using additional measures of progression. There was
concordance between central and investigator review and a positive correlation between
rPFS and OS among enzalutamide-treated patients.

 O
verall survival (OS) is the benchmark for regulatory
drugapprovalforpatientswithadvancedcancer.Since
2010, 5 agents have achieved the milestone of pro-
longing OS for men with metastatic castration-resistant pros-
tate cancer (mCRPC), and these agents have transformed the
management of the disease.1-8 The availability of these effec-
tive therapies, although clinically beneficial to patients, can
have a secondary effect of blunting the impact of an investi-
gational agent on OS by virtue of postprotocol exposures. Con-
sequently,developmenteffortsfocusingonOSarelikelytoshift
to more advanced and heavily pretreated clinical settings. End
points short of survival that represent clinical benefit and can
independently support regulatory approval will be necessary
to ensure that effective drugs are available to improve out-
comes for patients across all stages of disease.
To address this, the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Work-
ing Group 2 (PCWG2) developed a set of consensus criteria in
2008 regarding clinical trial conduct for contemporary stud-
ies in men with mCRPC.9 The PCWG2 stressed the impor-
tance of time-to-event measures that are not affected by post-
treatmenttherapiesandthatcouldbestronglylinkedtoclinical
outcomes that were indicative of a worsening disease status,
including deteriorations in quality of life, a need for a change
in anticancer therapy, and, ultimately, death from disease. One
such end point, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS),
is not affected by postprotocol treatments, but it has been dif-
ficult to quantify because of the lack of standardization of the
outcome measure itself.
The PCWG2 sought to establish a definition for rPFS that
would ensure that a drug was not working before therapy was
discontinued. One definition proposed by PCWG2 was a “2 +
2” rule, which stated that progression not be declared early in
a patient’
s treatment course unless at least 2 new lesions were
seen on the first on-treatment scan, followed by at least 2 ad-
ditionallesionsonthesecondposttreatmentscan.Therulewas
designed to control for tumor flare, a paradoxical worsening
of the bone scan attributed to bone healing as a result of a fa-
vorable antitumor effect.9,10 The central hypothesis was that
thecontinuousdevelopmentofnewlesionsonsequentialscans
was an indication that the cancer was continuing to grow and
spread as opposed to healing.
To enable the clinical validation of the PCWG2-proposed
bone scan progression measure, a quantitative and reproduc-
iblebonescanassaywasdeveloped,analyticallyvalidated,and
subsequently used as an integral part of the case report forms
of serial, prospectively conducted, large phase 3 studies using
androgen receptor (AR)–directed therapy.7,11,12 The progres-
sion biomarker was used first in the COU-AA-302 study of abi-
raterone acetate plus prednisone in chemotherapy-naive
patients with mCRPC as a component of the definition of rPFS,
which was a co–primary end point of the study.12 PREVAIL, a
phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
evaluating the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in chemo-
therapy-naive patients with mCRPC,7 was another trial that
used rPFS as a co–primary end point with OS, allowing for fur-
ther validation of the bone scan assay based on the PCWG2
criteria. As previously reported, PREVAIL demonstrated that
enzalutamide therapy decreased the risk of death by 29% (haz-
ard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.84; P < .001) and the risk
of radiographic progression by 81% (HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.15-
0.23; P < .001).7
A series of sensitivity analyses (SAs) were included in the
trial design of PREVAIL to evaluate how robust and clinically
meaningful the rPFS result signified.7,13 These prespecified
analyses examined the impact of additional measures of pro-
gression, including skeletal-related events (SREs), initiation of
radiotherapyandornewantineoplastictherapy,andunequivo-
calclinicalprogression,ontheprimaryrPFSanalysis.Thegoals
of these SAs were to confirm the clinical relevance of the
PCWG2 rPFS definition, to further examine concordance be-
tween central and investigator assessment using the bone cap-
ture data assay form, and to examine the correlation between
rPFS and OS.
Methods
ThePREVAILstudydesignhaspreviouslybeendescribed,7and
the trial protocol is available in Supplement 1. This study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and
was approved by the ethics committee at each participating
center. All patients provided written informed consent be-
fore enrollment.
Randomization and Masking
Patients were assigned 1:1 to receive enzalutamide 160 mg or
placebousingacentrallyadministered,randomizedpermuted-
block method and stratified by study site. All patients, inves-
tigators, site personnel, and sponsor personnel involved in the
conduct of the study were blinded to treatment assignment.
Primary Assessment of rPFS
The co–primary end points of PREVAIL were OS and rPFS, in
whichrPFSwasdefinedasthetimefromrandomizationtofirst
objective evidence of radiographic disease progression as-
sessed by blinded independent central review or death from
any cause within 168 days after treatment discontinuation,
whicheveroccurredfirst.Radiographicdiseaseprogressionwas
evaluated using a modified form of the PCWG2 guidelines for
bone disease9 and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tu-
mors, version 1.1, for soft-tissue disease.14
Key Points
Question What is the clinical relevance of the Prostate Cancer
Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) definition of radiographic
progression-free survival (rPFS)?
Findings In a series of prespecified sensitivity analyses of rPFS in
the PREVAIL randomized clinical trial of 1717 men with
chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate
cancer, enzalutamide significantly reduced the risk of radiographic
progression or death. Using 2 different statistical methods, rPFS
and overall survival were found to be positively correlated.
Meaning The PCWG2 definition of rPFS is a robust end point that
is clinically meaningful and associated with overall survival.

 A separate investigator assessment of imaging was per-
formed at each site using a bone scan worksheet adapted from
the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium.11 As speci-
fied, progression in bone (≥2 new lesions on radionuclide bone
scan)observedatweek9necessitated2ormoreadditionalnew
lesions on a confirmatory scan at least 6 weeks later; radio-
graphic disease progression in bone observed after week 9
necessitated 2 or more new lesions relative to the week 9 scan,
confirmed on a subsequent scan at least 6 weeks later. Radio-
graphic disease progression in soft tissue did not require a
confirmatory scan.14
Sensitivity Analysis of rPFS
Six SAs (SA1-SA6) based on investigator assessments were per-
formed (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Statistical Analysis and Censoring Procedures
The final intention-to-treat analysis of rPFS was performed by
the independent central review facility after 439 events (data
cutoff, May 6, 2012), and the interim intention-to-treat OS
analysis was performed after 540 events (data cutoff, Septem-
ber 16, 2013).
In all analyses, patients who were not known to have had
an rPFS event at the time of data cutoff were censored at the
date of last assessment. In the primary analysis, SA1, and SA2,
patients were censored for rPFS if, prior to objective evidence
of disease progression, there was a change in tumor scan
modality, initiation of a new antineoplastic treatment and/or
radiation therapy for prostate cancer, SRE, treatment discon-
tinuation, 2 or more consecutive missed tumor assessments,
or death after 168 days following treatment discontinuation
without progression. In SA4, patients who discontinued study
drug primarily because of clinical progression before objec-
tive evidence of radiographic disease progression were con-
sidered to have clinical progression on the date of the last dose
of study drug. In SA5, patients with soft-tissue disease pro-
gression through week 13 without a confirmatory scan were
censored at the date of earliest soft-tissue disease progres-
sion prior to week 13. In SA3 and SA6, the same censoring
rules for the primary analysis applied, except that new
SREs, any radiation therapy for prostate cancer, or new anti-
neoplastic therapy (SA3) and all deaths (SA6) were consid-
ered rPFS events.
All data analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.1.3
(SAS Institute), as previously described.7 Estimates of medi-
ans and 95% CIs were determined using the Kaplan-Meier
method. Hazard ratio relative to placebo (with less than 1.00
favoring enzalutamide) was determined using an unstrati-
fied Cox regression model with treatment as the only covari-
ate. The analysis of rPFS was conducted using a 2-sided
unstratified log-rank test with a type 1 error rate of .001.
Overall concordance between independent central
review and investigator assessments (using SA1) of the inten-
tion-to-treatpopulationwascalculatedas(concordanceforpro-
gressive disease) + (concordance for nonprogressive dis-
ease). In addition, correlations between rPFS (using SA2) and
OS were calculated using 2 methods: Spearman ρ and Kendall
τ via Clayton copula.15-18
Results
Patient Disposition and Demographic
and Clinical Characteristics
The primary results of PREVAIL have been published previ-
ously and showed that patient demographic and disease char-
acteristics were similar between treatment arms at baseline.7
The mean age at baseline was 72.0 (range, 43.0-93.0) years in
the enzalutamide arm and 71.0 (range, 42.0-93.0) years in the
placebo arm.7 Patient disposition is presented in Figure 1. In
allSAspresentedhere(exceptSA2),analyseswerebasedondata
from 832 patients in the enzalutamide arm and 801 patients in
theplaceboarm.InSA2,datafromallrandomizedpatientswere
used in the analysis (enzalutamide arm, n = 872; placebo arm,
n = 845). Results from all analyses are presented in Table 1.
Primary Analysis of rPFS
At the final cutoff date for primary rPFS analysis, 118 of 832
patients (14.2%) in the enzalutamide arm had an rPFS event,
compared with 321 of 801 patients (40.1%) in the placebo
arm. The majority of rPFS events resulted from radiographic
progression (105 of 118 and 295 of 321 patients, respectively).
Thirteen of 832 patients (1.6%) in the enzalutamide arm and
26 of 801 patients (3.2%) in the placebo arm died without ra-
diographic progression. Enzalutamide reduced the risk of ra-
diographic progression or death by 81% compared with pla-
cebo (HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.15-0.23; P < .001).7 Median time to
an rPFS event was not reached (95% CI, 13.8 to not reached

 [NR]) in the enzalutamide arm and was 3.9 months (95% CI,
3.7-5.4 months) in the placebo arm (Figure 2A).7
Concordance Between Independent and Investigator
Assessments of rPFS
Using the same censoring rules and final rPFS data cutoff date,
there was a high level of agreement between investigator as-
sessments of radiographic progression (SA1) and those
obtained by independent central assessment (eTable 2 in
Supplement 2). Agreement at the final rPFS analysis between
independent and investigator assessments for progressive and
nonprogressive disease was 87.6% (90.9% with enzalu-
tamide and 84.0% with placebo). Results from the remaining
SAs were consistent between investigator assessment and cen-
tral review (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). The main difference
in investigator and central assessment for the subset analy-
ses was the identification of soft-tissue progression, which did
not use a standardized data capture form and was consis-
tently higher when assessed by central review (eTable 4 in
Supplement 2).
Sensitivity Analyses of rPFS
To remove the confounding factor of investigator assessment
vs independent central review, and because SA1 differed from
the primary analysis only in the use of investigator assess-
ment, we used SA1 as the comparator. In SA1, enzalutamide
treatmentreducedtheriskofradiographicprogressionordeath
by 78% compared with placebo (HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.18-0.27;
P < .001) (Table 1). Median time to an rPFS event was 16.4
months (95% CI, 13.8 months to NR) in the enzalutamide arm
and 5.5 months (95% CI, 5.2-5.6 months) in the placebo arm
(Figure 2A).

 SA2 included all randomized patients with an additional
16monthsofdatacollection.Asexpected,thenumberofquali-
fying events increased substantially (Table 1). Enzalutamide
therapy reduced the risk of radiographic progression or death
by 69% (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.27-0.35; P < .001). Median time
to an rPFS event was 19.7 months (95% CI, 18.1-22.3 months)
in the enzalutamide arm and 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.2-5.6
months) in the placebo arm (Figure 2B).
In SA3, in which SREs or any use of radiation or antineo-
plastic therapy were counted as rPFS events, there was an in-
crease in the number of events, particularly in the placebo arm
(Table1).Inbothtreatmentarms,rPFSresultingfromdeathde-
creased, whereas the bulk of the additional rPFS events were
associated with new SREs and/or initiation of new antineoplas-
tictherapies.Enzalutamidereducedtheriskofradiographicpro-
gressionordeathby79%(HR,0.21;95%CI,0.18-0.26;P < .001).

16.4 months) in the enzalutamide arm and 3.7 months (95% CI,
3.6-4.4 months) in the placebo arm (Figure 3A).
In SA4, in which rPFS events included discontinuation of
treatment resulting from clinical progression prior to objec-
tive evidence of radiographic disease progression, there was
a modest increase in the number of qualifying events in both
treatment arms (Table 1). Enzalutamide therapy reduced the
riskofradiographicprogressionordeathby79%(HR,0.21;95%
CI, 0.17-0.26; P < .001). Median time to an rPFS event was 14.2
months (95% CI, 13.8 months to NR) in the enzalutamide arm
and 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.6-5.6 months) in the placebo arm
(Figure 3B).
In SA5, in which progression related to soft-tissue dis-
ease required a confirmatory scan, there was a decrease in the
number of qualifying events in both treatment arms. Al-
though the number of radiographic progression events de-
creased in both treatment arms, the number of deaths re-
mained the same in the enzalutamide arm and increased in the
placeboarm(Table1).Enzalutamidetreatmentreducedtherisk
of radiographic progression or death by 77% (HR, 0.23; 95%
CI, 0.19-0.30; P < .001). The median time to an rPFS event was
16.4 months (95% CI, 13.8 months to NR) in the enzalutamide
arm and 5.7 months (95% CI, 5.5-8.2 months) in the placebo
arm (Figure 3C).
ThedefinitionofrPFSintheprimaryanalysisincludeddeath
from any cause within 168 days of treatment discontinuation.
In SA6, any death was considered an rPFS event, regardless of
length of time after study drug discontinuation, which re-
sulted in a modest decrease in the number of qualifying events
in both treatment arms (Table 1). The number of radiographic
progression events decreased in both treatment arms. As ex-
pected, the number of deaths increased in both treatment
arms, although the increase was modest in the enzalutamide
arm.Enzalutamidetherapyreducedtheriskofradiographicpro-
gressionordeathby77%(HR,0.23;95%CI,0.19-0.30;P < .001).
Median time to an rPFS event was 15.0 months (95% CI, 13.8
months to NR) in the enzalutamide arm and 6.0 months (95%
CI, 5.5-8.2 months) in the placebo arm (Figure 3D).
Correlation of rPFS and OS
At the planned interim analysis for OS, there were 540 deaths
and889investigator-assessedrPFSevents.Treatmentwithen-
zalutamide resulted in a 29% decrease in the risk of death com-
pared with placebo (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.84; P < .001).7
Using SA2, rPFS was positively associated with OS among all
patients and patients in each treatment arm using 2 different
methods (Table 2). Spearman ρ was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.67-0.76)
among all patients, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.92) among enzalu-
tamide-treated patients, and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.43-0.61) among
placebo-treated patients. Kendall τ was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.49-
0.57) among all patients, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68-0.77) among en-
zalutamide-treated patients, and 0.37 (95% CI, 0.30-0.44)
among placebo-treated patients.

 own right is essential to ensure the timely development of
drugsneededtofurtherimprovepatientoutcomes.Towardthis
objective, PREVAIL included in its design the co–primary end
points of OS and rPFS.
The results of PREVAIL further confirmed the rigor of the
PCWG2 definition of rPFS using a standardized bone scan data
capture assay in patients with mCRPC. There was a high de-
gree of concordance between the central and investigator re-
views in both treatment arms. Notably, individual investiga-
tors were trained at each site using the bone scan data capture
forms and the end result was a high level of reproducibility be-
tween readers, which highlights the clinical utility of this end
point. The prespecified SAs in the PREVAIL study showed the
impact of different clinical factors on rPFS, including SREs, ini-
tiation of radiotherapy and/or new antineoplastic therapy, and
unequivocal clinical progression, which all confirmed the su-
periority of enzalutamide over placebo.
The PREVAIL analysis is the second to demonstrate a posi-
tive correlation between rPFS using the PCWG2 criteria and OS
(Spearman ρ of 0.72 and Kendall τ of 0.53 for all patients). The
COU-AA-302trialalsodemonstratedacorrelationbetweenrPFS
and OS12; both studies used the PCWG2 definition of radio-
graphicprogression,involvedpatientswithmCRPCwhohadnot
received chemotherapy, and involved treatment that targeted
the AR axis. Both studies also found a high concordance be-
tween the central and investigator reads, validating the repro-
ducibility of the analytically validated bone scan progression
biomarkertodocumentrPFSdiseaseprogression.Notably,there
were only 188 progression events in the PREVAIL enzalu-
tamide arm vs 542 in the COU-AA-302 abiraterone acetate plus
prednisone arm. As a result, although the HR was high for the
enzalutamidearm(0.19),theeventratewasrelativelylow,afact
that may bias the analyses accordingly.
Because the distribution of data was not known up front,
2 different statistical methods were used that measured cor-
relation in slightly different ways. Spearman ρ and Kendall τ
rank correlations are both nonparametric tests, with no as-
sumption about the distribution of data and often used for
nonlinear monotonic relationships.19 Spearman ρ measures
how the magnitude and direction of change of one end point

 corresponds to the magnitude and direction of change of the
other end point, whereas Kendall τ only considers the direc-
tion of change. Consequently, Kendall τ generally results in a
value closer to 0 (no correlation) than Spearman ρ does.20 Re-
sults from both analyses in this study were consistent, with a
positive correlation.
In our analysis, the lower correlation between rPFS and OS
seen with placebo-treated patients than seen with enzalu-
tamide-treated patients could be partly related to postproto-
col exposure to life-prolonging therapy. Patients in the pla-
cebo arm received more postprotocol therapies than those in
the enzalutamide arm (76% vs 44%), including docetaxel (57%
vs 33%), abiraterone acetate (46% vs 21%), and enzalutamide
(4% vs 1%).7
Limitations
PREVAIL and COU-AA-302 both studied drugs that target the
AR signaling pathway and enrolled chemotherapy-naive pa-
tientswithmCRPC.Theuseofaco–primaryendpointusingboth
OS and rPFS in both studies was designed to clearly demon-
strate clinical benefit; however, the studies were not designed
to address rPFS as a surrogate for survival. In addition, the re-
sultsbasedonendpointsfromtheseAR-directedtrialsmaynot
be applicable to biologic agents, bone microenvironment-
directed approaches, and non-AR-targeted therapies, whose
impact on the tumor, and consequently on radiographic pro-
gression, has not yet been fully defined. It is anticipated that a
one-size-fits-all end point that is general enough to encom-
pass all therapies in all clinical scenarios will not be sufficient
toenableregulatoryapprovals.Asaresult,thedefinitionofrPFS
as a clinically relevant end point may need to be adapted and,
if so, revalidated accordingly to fit the disease, population,
imaging modality, and treatment involved.
Conclusions
In this series of prespecified SAs of data from the PREVAIL trial
of men with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC, the PCWG2 defini-
tion of rPFS was found to be a robust and clinically meaning-
ful end point associated with OS in enzalutamide-treated
patients.
