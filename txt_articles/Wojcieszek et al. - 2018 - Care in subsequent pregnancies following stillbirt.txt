Objective To assess the frequency of additional care, and parents’
perceptions of quality, respectful care, in pregnancies subsequent
to stillbirth.
Design Multi-language web-based survey.
Setting International.
Population A total of 2716 parents, from 40 high- and middle-
income countries.
Methods Data were obtained from a broader survey of parents’
experiences following stillbirth. Data were analysed using
descriptive statistics and stratified by geographic region. Subgroup
analyses explored variation in additional care by gestational age at
index stillbirth.
Main outcome measures Frequency of additional care, and
perceptions of quality, respectful care.
Results The majority (66%) of parents conceived their subsequent
pregnancy within 1 year of stillbirth. Additional antenatal care
visits and ultrasound scans were provided for 67% and 70% of
all parents, respectively, although there was wide variation across
geographic regions. Care addressing psychosocial needs was less
frequently provided, such as additional visits to a bereavement
counsellor (10%) and access to named care provider’s phone
number (27%). Compared with parents whose stillbirth occurred
at ≤ 29 weeks of gestation, parents whose stillbirth occurred at
≥ 30 weeks of gestation were more likely to receive various forms
of additional care, particularly the option for early delivery after
37 weeks. Around half (47–63%) of all parents felt that elements
of quality, respectful care were consistently applied, such as
spending enough time with parents and involving parents in
decision-making.
Conclusions Greater attention is required to providing thoughtful,
empathic and collaborative care in all pregnancies following
stillbirth. Specific education and training for health professionals
is needed.
Keywords Epidemiology, management, psychosocial/psychology,

Mixed-methods – Care & outcome after stillbirth
 Plain Language Summary
Study rationale and design
More than two million babies are stillborn every year. Most parents will conceive again soon after having a stillborn baby. These
parents are more likely to have another stillborn baby in the next pregnancy than parents who have not had a stillborn baby before.
The next pregnancy after stillbirth is often an extremely anxious time for parents, as they worry about whether their baby will survive.
In this study we asked 2716 parents from 40 countries about the care they received during their first pregnancy after stillbirth. Parents
were recruited mainly through the International Stillbirth Alliance and completed on online survey that was available in six languages.
Findings
Parents often had extra antenatal visits and extra ultrasound scans in the next pregnancy, but they rarely had extra emotional support.
Also, many parents felt their care providers did not always listen to them and spend enough time with them, involve them in
decisions, and take their concerns seriously. Parents were more likely to receive various forms of extra care in the next pregnancy if
their baby had died later in pregnancy compared to earlier in pregnancy.
Limitations
In this study we only have information from parents who were able and willing to complete an online survey. Most of the parents
were involved in charity and support groups and most parents lived in developed countries. We do not know how well the findings
relate to other parents. Finally, our study does not include parents who may have tried for another pregnancy but were not able to
conceive.
Potential impact
This study can help to improve care through the development of best practice guidelines for pregnancies following stillbirth. The
results suggest that parents need better emotional support in these pregnancies, and more opportunities to participate actively in
decisions about care. Extra support should be available no matter how far along in pregnancy the previous stillborn baby died.

Introduction
Globally,
around
2.6
million
third-trimester
stillbirths
occur every year.1 These deaths are associated with endur-
ing psychosocial and economic consequences.2–4 The risk
of stillbirth and other related pregnancy complications5 is
increased for parents who have had a previous stillbirth; a
systematic review including over three million women
showed an almost five-fold increased risk of stillbirth
among women in high-income countries with a previous
stillbirth from any cause.6
There is currently little evidence to guide clinical man-
agement
of
pregnancies
subsequent
to
stillbirth.7–10
Women often want increased antepartum surveillance and
early birth in these pregnancies,11 but in many cases the
medical benefits of such practices remain uncertain. In
addition to recurrent stillbirth, previous stillbirth is associ-
ated with various adverse pregnancy outcomes.5,12,13 some
of which may be iatrogenic.14 In one study, increased
surveillance and early birth were commonly recommended
by obstetricians for pregnancies subsequent to unexplained
stillbirth, regardless of the presence or absence of (other)
obstetric risk factors.14 The Royal College of Obstetricians
and Gynaecologists recommends that decisions for sched-
uled birth following unexplained stillbirth consider the
gestational age of the previous stillbirth, previous intra-
partum history, and the safety of induction of labour.15
Similarly,
the
American
College
of
Obstetricians
and
Gynecologists encourages clinicians to balance the benefits
of early delivery with its potential risks to mothers and
babies.10
In addition to specialised clinical care subsequent to
stillbirth, it is critical to address parents’ unique psychoso-
cial needs. Pregnancies subsequent to perinatal death are
often characterised by intense anxiety, fear and other
complex emotional responses.2,4,16 Many women doubt
their capacity to maintain a healthy pregnancy, and some
may refrain from attachment to their baby as a coping
mechanism.2,4,16 Indeed, disorganised attachment is more
common among infants born subsequent to stillbirth,17
and this may have extended adverse consequences for
families.
It is clear that, in pregnancies after stillbirth, expectant
parents may benefit from specialised clinical care and emo-
tional support. The aim of this study was to assess the fre-
quency with which additional clinical care and psychosocial
support were provided in pregnancies subsequent to still-
birth, and to assess parents’ perceptions of the extent to
which they received quality, respectful care. We also
explored whether the provision of additional care in
194

 subsequent pregnancies differed depending on the gestation
of the previous (hereafter ‘index’) stillbirth.
Methods
Data collection involved a large-scale, multi-language web-
based survey of bereaved parents developed as part of The
Lancet series on Ending Preventable Stillbirths (see Flenady
et al.18 for methods). A section of the survey was devoted
to care during pregnancies subsequent to stillbirth, which
was made available to parents who responded ‘Yes’ to
‘Have you had another pregnancy since your baby was still-
born?’ Categorical items assessed obstetric characteristics of
the subsequent pregnancy, provision of additional care in
the subsequent pregnancy, and perceptions of quality,
respectful care in pregnancies subsequent to stillbirth (see
subheadings below). Additional open-ended items assessed
parents’ perceptions on the most important aspects of care
in their subsequent pregnancy and how their care could
have been improved (not reported in this manuscript).
Parents who had had more than one subsequent pregnancy
after stillbirth were asked to answer questions with regard
to their first subsequent pregnancy. Because of the recruit-
ment method adopted in this study, we could not deter-
mine the total number of parents who received a survey
invitation
(denominator),
and
therefore
the
overall
response rate is unknown.
Provision of additional care
Parents were asked via one categorical item whether they
received any additional care (beyond standard antenatal
care
in
their
setting)
in
their
subsequent
pregnancy.
Response options included additional antenatal care visits;
additional ultrasound scans; the option for early (sched-
uled) delivery after 37 weeks of gestation; additional emer-
gency room visits; additional visits to a bereavement
counsellor; provision of a named care provider’s phone
number; and specialist antenatal classes for bereaved par-
ents. Parents could select all options that applied, along
with an ‘other’ option with space for free-text. ‘Unsure’
and ‘I prefer not to answer’ response options were also
provided. GOOGLE TRANSLATE software was used to translate
non-English
responses
to
the
‘other’
additional
care
response option, and translations were checked for accu-
racy and edited where required by co-authors or other vol-
unteers. Responses were coded in SPSS V22 (Version 22,
IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Provision of quality, respectful care
Seven items measuring quality, respectful care were devel-
oped with reference to criteria defined by Small et al.19
(e.g. ‘Did your care providers spend enough time with
you?’
and
‘Did
your
care
providers
involve
you
in
decision-making about care?’). Items were measured on a
four-point categorical scale (‘Never’ / ‘Some of the time’ /
‘Most of the time’ / ‘Always’). An ‘I prefer not to answer’
response option was also provided.
Statistical analyses
Demographic data, provision of additional care and per-
ceptions of quality, respectful care were assessed using
descriptive statistics expressed as frequencies and propor-
tions. To explore trends in care according to geographic
location,
outcome
data
were
stratified
by
geographic
region. Subgroup differences in provision of additional care
by gestation at index stillbirth were assessed across the
study sample using chi-square tests with 2 9 2 contingency
tables. Gestation at index stillbirth was dichotomised into
≤ 29 weeks of gestation versus ≥ 30 weeks of gestation.
This cut-off was chosen to approximate the distinction
between early and late/third-trimester stillbirth. We report
the corresponding Pearson chi-square value with continuity
correction for 2 9 2 tables and statistical significance set at
P < 0.05. Effect sizes for significant results were reported
using the Phi coefficient. Magnitude of effect sizes was
described according to the conventions in Pallant.20 All
analyses were performed in SPSS V22.
Results
Characteristics of parents
Of the 4182 respondents to the broader survey, 2716 par-
ents indicated that they had a subsequent pregnancy (2507
female; 204 male; 5 gender not stated). (For detail on
responses received for the broader survey of parents, see
Flenady et al.18) Table 1 presents demographic and obstet-
ric characteristics of these 2716 parents. A breakdown of
responses by geographic region and country is presented in
the Table S1. Parents were most commonly aged 30–
39 years
(55%),
had
an
undergraduate/college
degree
(45%), and were employed full-time (44%). For the major-
ity of parents, the index stillbirth occurred in the antepar-
tum
period
(74%)
and
within
≥ 3 years
of
survey
completion (65%). Index stillbirths occurred most com-
monly at 35–40 weeks of gestation. Around half of parents
(55%) reported that an autopsy/post-mortem examination
was performed on their stillborn baby. Of these 1504 par-
ents, 90% reported having received some kind of informa-
tion about the examination results, though the survey did
not probe further as to what information was received.
Most (66%) parents conceived their subsequent preg-
nancy within 1 year following stillbirth. The most com-
mon outcome of subsequent pregnancies was a live birth
(67%), followed by miscarriage (16%). Around 12% of all
parents were still pregnant at the time of survey comple-
tion. Approximately 2.9% of parents had a recurrent

 stillbirth. The majority (88%) of parents resided in high-
income countries, with the remainder residing in middle-
income
countries
(see
Table
S1).
The
majority
of
middle-income countries were represented in the Latin
America regional grouping (see Table S1).
Provision of additional care
Table 2 shows provision of additional care in subsequent
pregnancies overall and by geographic region. Most parents
(67%) received additional antenatal care visits, ranging
from 54% in southern Europe to 78% in the UK and Ire-
land. The majority (70%) also had additional ultrasound
scans, ranging from 51% in southern Europe to 90% in
northern Europe. Around 37% of parents were offered
early delivery after 37 weeks of gestation, ranging from
16% in Latin America to 59% in northern Europe. The
provision of additional visits to a bereavement counsellor
ranged from 6 to 22%, and the provision of a named care
provider’s phone number ranged from 18 to 36%. Special-
ist antenatal classes for bereaved parents were uncommon
in all regions (1–8%), and particularly western Europe
(1%). No additional care was provided to 15% of parents
overall, most frequently in southern Europe (24%). Overall,
6% of parents reported receiving ‘other’ additional care,
including delivery at or before 37 weeks of gestation, addi-
tional testing or monitoring, and specialist referrals (see
Table 2). Provision of these ‘other’ forms of care ranged
from 2% in Latin America to 13% in North America. Two
respondents used the ‘other’ additional care item to indi-
cate that while they did not want any additional care, it
had been made available to them (e.g. additional ultra-
sound scans).
Subgroup analyses of additional care by gestation
at index stillbirth
Six parents did not provide data on gestation at index still-
birth, resulting in a sample size of 2710 for subgroup anal-
yses.

 corresponding effect sizes for each analysis. Compared with
parents whose index stillbirth occurred at ≤ 29 weeks gesta-
tion, additional antenatal care visits and ultrasound scans
were significantly more frequent among parents whose
index
stillbirth
occurred
at
≥ 30 weeks
of
gestation
(P < 0.001). Both results showed small to medium effect
sizes (see Table 3). Additional visits to a bereavement
counsellor, provision of a named care provider’s phone
number, and specialist antenatal classes were also more fre-
quent among parents whose index stillbirth occurred at
≥ 30 weeks of gestation compared with ≤ 29 weeks of ges-
tation, showing small effect sizes. The option for early
delivery after 37 weeks of gestation was more likely when
the index stillbirth occurred at ≥ 30 weeks of gestation
compared
with
≤ 29 weeks
of
gestation
(P < 0.001),
showing a medium to large effect size. Lack of additional
care was more likely when the index stillbirth occurred at
≤ 29 weeks, showing a small to medium effect size. There
was no difference in visits to the emergency room accord-
ing to gestation at index stillbirth (P = 0.225).
Provision of quality, respectful care
Across the study sample, elements of quality, respectful care
most consistently carried out were treating parents with
kindness and respect, and talking to parents in a way that
they could understand, both reported to have ‘always’
occurred by 63% and 60% of parents, respectively (see
Table 4). Around 53% of all parents ‘always’ felt listened
to, ranging from 43% in southern Europe to 69% in North
America, while 53% felt their concerns were ‘always’ taken

Subsequent pregnancies following stillbirth
 seriously, ranging from 42% in southern Europe to 65% in
North America. Just over half (51%) of parents felt that
they were ‘always’ involved in decision-making about their
care, most commonly in North America (66%) and least
commonly in southern Europe (41%). Around half (48%)
of parents were ‘always’ given the information they needed,
ranging from 41% in southern Europe to 61% in North
America. Spending enough time with parents was the least
consistently applied aspect, which ‘always’ occurred accord-
ing to 47% of all parents.
Discussion
Main findings
The majority of parents conceived their subsequent preg-
nancy within 1 year following stillbirth. Increased antepar-
tum surveillance in subsequent pregnancies, particularly
additional ultrasound scans, was common, although there
was wide variation across geographic regions. Care specifi-
cally addressing psychosocial needs was less frequent across
all regions. Compared with parents whose index stillbirth
occurred at ≤ 29 weeks of gestation, parents whose index
stillbirth occurred at ≥ 30 weeks of gestation were more
likely
to
receive
various
forms
of
additional
care,
particularly the option for early delivery after 37 weeks of
gestation. Roughly half of all parents felt that elements of
quality, respectful care were applied consistently. The great-
est opportunities for improvement across all regions related
to listening to and spending time with parents, providing
information, involving parents in decision-making, and
taking parents’ concerns seriously.
Strengths and limitations
This study is strengthened by the large international sam-
ple, capturing of data from multiple geographic regions.
The use of a multi-language survey further enhanced our
capacity to gain an ‘international picture’ of care. However,
participating parents were largely recruited through charity
and support groups in high-income countries, which may
not be representative of the broader population of parents
who have had a stillbirth. Indeed, our sample over-repre-
sented educated men and women, those with the means
and willingness to respond to a web-based survey. It is pos-
sible that the findings over-estimate the level of compas-
sionate care received by the broader population of parents,
which would only reinforce the need for improvements in
care. The survey sought to gain a comprehensive picture of
parents’ experiences while minimising the burden placed

 on
respondents
and

the

of
data
obtained. For this reason, information was not collected
about potentially important aspects of parents’ experiences,
including specific procedures performed, screening for
depression, or cause of death for the index stillbirth, all of
which might be expected to influence clinical care. Finally,
our study is confined to the care experiences of those par-
ents who had a subsequent pregnancy and did not identify
or address the care of those who may have attempted but
not achieved a new pregnancy.
Interpretation
The risk of stillbirth recurrence in the current study was
2.9%, which is similar to that reported in the systematic
review by Lamont et al. (2.5%).6 Our findings around
increased antepartum surveillance are also consistent with
previous research.11,14,16,21–23 Additional antenatal care vis-
its and ultrasound scans therefore appear to be frequently
provided in pregnancies subsequent to stillbirth, often
bringing increased healthcare costs.24 However, although
most parents received additional antenatal care visits and
ultrasound scans, far fewer received additional care specifi-
cally addressing psychosocial needs. Specialist antenatal
classes for bereaved parents were rarely provided, despite
the benefits of group-based/peer antenatal support and
education programmes for parents who have experienced
loss.16,25 Unavailability of the necessary infrastructure, staff
and expertise, as well as competing demands on resources,
may explain the relative rarity of these psychosocial aspects
of care. In addition, dedicated clinical guidelines around
care in pregnancies after stillbirth appear to be rare, as
found in a recent survey of UK practice.22 According to
the UK study, availability of such guidelines was limited
and, where guidelines were available, these tended to con-
centrate on the prevention of stillbirth recurrence through
antepartum surveillance, rather than on parents’ psychoso-
cial wellbeing.22 Altogether, evidence suggests that the med-
ical risks associated with previous stillbirth are addressed
far more frequently than the psychosocial risks, even
though the latter are more common.
The opportunities for improvement in providing quality,
respectful care identified in this study mirror those that
enhance parents’ emotional wellbeing in pregnancies subse-
quent to stillbirth or neonatal death.16 Active involvement
in care and shared decision-making26 are particularly val-
ued, and may aid coping in these anxiety-laden pregnancies
by enhancing self-confidence and feelings of control.27,28
These elements of care also reflect good practice in
bereavement care, where similar deficiencies in quality have
been identified.2,18,29 Lack of time, lack of confidence,
embarrassment, and lack of understanding of stillbirth
among care providers are major barriers to providing qual-
ity bereavement care.29 These same barriers are likely to
impact care in pregnancies after stillbirth also. Therefore,
as for bereavement care, training in communication skills
and providing thoughtful, empathic and collaborative care
is undoubtedly needed for those providing care in subse-
quent pregnancies following stillbirth.
The majority of parents conceived their subsequent preg-
nancy within 1 year following stillbirth, and over one-third
within 5 months. These data are consistent with previous
studies,30–32 and may be explained by the overwhelming
desire among many women to fulfil their reproductive
aspirations and expectations.4,23,32 An interpregnancy inter-
val of 15–24 months has been recommended33 following
stillbirth to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes, although
evidence to support this recommendation is limited.33
Regardless of obstetric risks, women who conceive within
1 year of a stillbirth may have a higher risk of depression
and anxiety in the subsequent pregnancy, whereas women
who delay conception for 1 year may be at no higher risk
than the general population.31 Conversely, delaying concep-
tion may bring an added psychological burden to women
struggling with feelings of ‘emptiness’ or having ‘failed’,23,32
while intensifying potential fears about age-related fertility
decline.32,34 Future research assessing the emotional impact
of unwanted delays in conception following stillbirth will
inform counselling efforts and assist care providers to offer
balanced information to parents.
The current study showed that the option for early deliv-
ery after 37 weeks of gestation was significantly more com-
mon among parents whose index stillbirth occurred later in
pregnancy compared with earlier in pregnancy. The inclina-
tion towards early delivery may be heightened at near-term
gestational ages (37–39 weeks) when the risk : benefit ratio
becomes more favourable,35 and when approaching the ges-
tational age at which the index stillbirth occurred. Addi-
tional antenatal care visits and ultrasound scans, additional
visits to a bereavement counsellor, provision of care provi-
der’s phone number and specialist antenatal classes for
bereaved parents were also more likely when the index still-
birth occurred at later gestations. It is therefore possible
that both the impact of the previous loss and its perceived
preventability, which may be thought by some to be greater
for later gestation stillbirths, alters care pathways in subse-
quent pregnancies. Stillbirths occurring at earlier gestations
are often associated with complications such as sponta-
neous preterm birth,36 which carry a substantial recurrence
risk, but are difficult to prevent.37 Nonetheless, because
stillbirth recurrence risk36,38 and parents’ emotional needs
in subsequent pregnancies are no less important for those
who experienced stillbirth at lower gestations, such differ-
ential allocation of services does not seem justified. Future
research in care in subsequent pregnancies may shed more
light on these findings and has been prioritised by bereaved
parents and care providers.18,39

Subsequent pregnancies following stillbirth
 Conclusion
Greater attention is required to providing thoughtful,
empathic and collaborative care in all pregnancies following
stillbirth. Formal training and clinical practice guidance for
providing care in pregnancies subsequent to stillbirth is
urgently needed, emphasising emotional and psychological
aspects of care in addition to obstetric management, and
doing so irrespective of the gestational age of the stillborn
baby. The roles of specialist services and staff for providing
care
in
pregnancies
after
stillbirth
should
be
further
explored.
