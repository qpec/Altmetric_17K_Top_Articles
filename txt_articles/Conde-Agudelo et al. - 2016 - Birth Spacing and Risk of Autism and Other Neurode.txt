and Other Neurodevelopmental 
Disabilities: A Systematic Review

abstract
CONTEXT: Both short and long interpregnancy intervals (IPIs) have recently been associated 
with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, this association has not 
been systematically evaluated.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between birth spacing and the risk of ASD and other 
neurodevelopmental disabilities.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases from their inception to December 2015, bibliographies, and 
conference proceedings.
STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies with results adjusted for potential confounding factors 
that reported on the association between IPIs or birth intervals and neurodevelopmental 
disabilities.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, IPIs/
birth intervals, and outcome measures.
RESULTS: Seven studies (1 140 210 children) reported an association between short IPIs 
and increased risk of ASD, mainly the former subtype autistic disorder. Compared with 
children born to women with IPIs of ≥36 months, children born to women with IPIs of 
<12 months had a significantly increased risk of any ASD (pooled adjusted odds ratio [OR] 
1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–3.09). This association was stronger for autistic 
disorder (pooled adjusted OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.53–4.50). Three of these studies also reported 
a significant association between long IPIs and increased risk of ASD. Short intervals were 
associated with a significantly increased risk of developmental delay (3 studies; 174 940 
children) and cerebral palsy (2 studies; 19 419 children).
LIMITATIONS: Substantial heterogeneity, and few studies assessing neurodevelopmental 
disabilities other than ASD.
CONCLUSIONS: Short IPIs are associated with a significantly increased risk of ASD. Long IPIs also 
appear to increase the risk of ASD.

Neurodevelopmental disabilities are 
a diverse group of chronic disorders 
that begin at any time during the 
development process (including 
conception, birth, and growth) up to 
22 years of age and last throughout 
an individual’s lifetime.1 Major 
disabilities include intellectual 
disability, learning disabilities, 
communication disorders, autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD), and 
cerebral palsy, among others. In 
2007, it was estimated that >200 
million children <5 years of age in 
developing countries suffer from 
some kind of developmental delay 
or disability.2 In the United States, 
neurodevelopmental disabilities 
affect 15% of children aged 3 to 17 
years (nearly 10 million children in 
2006–2008), 
3 and ∼1 in 68 children 
has been identified with ASD.4
Most neurodevelopmental disabilities 
are thought to be caused by a 
complex mix of factors, which vary 
depending on the particular disorder 
and the individual. These factors 
include genetics, environment, 
parental health and behaviors 
during pregnancy, complications 
during birth, and perinatal 
infections. Recent findings suggest 
an early prenatal origin of some 
neurodevelopmental disorders such 
as ASD.5, 
6 In addition, several studies 
have found associations between 
prenatal and perinatal conditions 
and the risk of ASD, 
7, 
8 attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 
9, 
10 
developmental delay or disability, 
11, 
12 
and cerebral palsy.13, 
14
There is compelling evidence from 
several systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses that both short and 
long intervals between pregnancies 
are associated with an increased 
risk of adverse maternal, perinatal, 
infant, and child outcomes.15–23 The 
relationship between birth spacing 
and the risk of neurodevelopmental 
disabilities has received less 
attention. In 2005, a World Health 
Organization technical consultation 
on birth spacing recommended 
conducting studies that investigate 
the impact of birth spacing on 
the psychological and neurologic 
development of children.24 This 
topic is relevant to public health and 
clinical practice because if short and/
or long intervals are independently 
associated with an increased risk of 
ASD and other neurodevelopmental 
disabilities, helping women and 
couples achieve healthy pregnancy 
spacing might contribute to reducing 
such adverse outcomes. Hence, we 
performed a systematic review 
whose primary aim was to compile 
and critically assess the existing 
evidence on the relationship between 
birth spacing and the risk of ASD 
and other neurodevelopmental 
disabilities through the use of formal 
methods for systematic reviews and 
meta-analytic techniques.
METHODS
This systematic review was 
conducted following a prospectively 
prepared protocol and reported 
in accordance with recommended 
methods for systematic reviews 
of observational studies.25 Two 
of the authors (A.C.-A., A.R.-B.) 
independently retrieved and 
reviewed studies for eligibility, 
assessed their risk of bias, and 
extracted data. All disagreements 
encountered in the review process 
were resolved through consensus.
Study Selection
We included studies that met the 
following criteria: 
1. Study design: cohort, cross-
sectional, or case-control studies 
that evaluated the relationship 
between birth spacing and the 
risk of any neurodevelopmental 
disability in the younger child of a 
pair of siblings (index child). 
2. Exposure: use of any interval 
preceding the birth of the 
younger sibling (interpregnancy 
interval [IPI], defined as the time 
elapsed between the birth of the 
immediate older sibling and the 
conception of the younger sibling; 
or birth interval, defined as the 
time elapsed between the birth of 
the immediate older sibling and 
the birth of the younger sibling) as 
the measure of birth spacing.
3. Outcome measures: the primary 
outcome measure of interest 
was ASD. The latest revision of 
the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders 
(Fifth Edition) merged all autism 
disorders into the umbrella term 
“autism spectrum disorder” 
without a definition of subtypes. 
However, we also assessed the 
association between birth spacing 
and the former autism subtypes 
“autistic disorder”, “pervasive 
developmental disorder-not 
otherwise specified” (PDD-
NOS), and “Asperger disorder.” 
Secondary outcome measures 
included developmental delay, 
cerebral palsy, intellectual 
disabilities, communication 
disorders, attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, 
specific learning disorder, 
motor disorders, hearing loss, 
vision impairment, and other 
neurodevelopmental disabilities.
4. Statistical analysis: the authors of 
the studies must have adjusted the 
results for potential confounding 
factors. Studies were excluded 
from the review if they exclusively 
used univariate (unadjusted) 
analysis, if they used only the 
interval after the birth of the 
index child (succeeding interval), 
or if they did not provide data. 
Studies included in the systematic 
review were also included in the 
meta-analyses if they used IPI 
as the measure of birth spacing, 
provided data for ≥4 IPI strata, 
and reported unadjusted and/
or adjusted odds ratio (OR) or 
relative risk (RR) estimates and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) or 
data to calculate them.

Data Sources and Searches
A literature search was undertaken 
in Medline, Embase, POPLINE, 
CINAHL, LILACS, and ECLA (all from 
inception to December 31, 2015) by 
using a combination of key words 
and text words related to “birth 
spacing” and “neurodevelopmental 
disabilities” (see Supplemental 
Table). Google Scholar, proceedings 
of congresses on pediatric neurology 
and neurodevelopmental disabilities, 
reference lists of identified studies, 
and review articles were also 
searched. No language restrictions 
were applied. If study findings were 
published in >1 source, we included 
only the most recent or complete 
study and supplemented if additional 
information appeared in other 
publications.
Assessment of Risk of Bias
Study quality was assessed by using 
6 criteria deemed by the authors 
to be important for the quality of 
observational studies evaluating the 
association between birth spacing 
and neurodevelopmental disabilities. 
The assessments were judged as “low 
risk, 
” “high risk, 
” or “unclear risk” 
of bias. The criteria evaluated and 
how they were interpreted were as 
follows:
1. Measure of birth spacing used. 
“Low risk of bias”: the study used 
IPI as measure of birth spacing; 
“high risk of bias”: the study used 
birth interval as measure of birth 
spacing.
2. Categorization of exposure. “Low 
risk of bias”: the study examined 
≥4 categories of pregnancy 
intervals; “high risk of bias”: the 
study examined <4 categories of 
pregnancy intervals.
3. Ascertainment of outcomes. “Low 
risk of bias”: based on medical 
records or direct assessment 
or validated outcomes if 
administrative databases were 
used; “high risk of bias”: based 
exclusively on a report that 
comes from patients or relatives 
or unvalidated outcomes if 
administrative databases were 
used.
4. Blinding. “Low risk of bias”: 
assessment of both birth spacing 
status and outcomes was 
performed while investigators 
were blinded; “high risk of bias”: 
assessment of birth spacing status 
or outcomes was not blinded.
5. Loss to follow-up or exclusions 
(only for cohort and cross-
sectional studies) or period of 
time for recruitment of children 
(only for case-control studies). 
“Low risk of bias”: loss to 
follow-up or nonvalid exclusions 
(improper elimination of records) 
were <10% (for cohort studies) 
or case patients and controls 
recruited during the same 
period of time (for case-control 
studies); “high risk of bias”: loss to 
follow-up or nonvalid exclusions 
were ≥10% (for cohort studies) or 
children recruited from different 
periods of time (for case-control 
studies).
6. Control for confounding factors 
and assessment of mediating 
factors. “Low risk of bias”: the 
study controlled for maternal 
age and at least 1 measure 
of socioeconomic status (eg, 
occupation and work status, 
educational level, income, or 
housing) and tested whether 
the association between 
birth spacing and ASD/other 
neurodevelopmental disabilities 
was mediated through preterm 
birth or low birth weight; “high 
risk of bias”: the study did not 
control for maternal age and at 
least 1 measure of socioeconomic 
status or did not test the mediator 
effect of preterm birth or low birth 
weight.
If there was insufficient information 
available to make a judgment about 
these criteria, then they were scored 
as “unclear risk of bias.”
Data Extraction
Data were extracted by using a 
specifically designed form for 
capturing information on study 
design, characteristics of the study 
population, sample size, measure of 
birth spacing used, categorization of 
intervals, measures of outcome, study 
quality, and unadjusted and adjusted 
ORs or RRs with their 95% CIs for 
individual neurodevelopmental 
disabilities associated with all 
pregnancy intervals. We contacted 
authors to obtain additional or 
missing data.
Data Synthesis and Statistical 
Analysis
Pooled unadjusted and adjusted 
ORs for the association between 
IPI and the risk of any ASD and the 
former subtype autistic disorder 
were calculated. Data available from 
studies allowed us to categorize 
IPIs into <12, 12 to 23, 24 to 35, and 
≥36 months as well as <12, 12 to 
23, 24 to 59, and ≥60 months. The 
referent categories used were ≥36 
and 24 to 59 months, respectively. 
Data extracted from each study were 
arranged in 2 × 2 tables. ORs with 
their 95% CIs for ASD and autistic 
disorder were then calculated 
separately for the predefined 
categories of IPIs. Results from 
different reports were combined to 
produce pooled unadjusted ORs with 
95% CIs according to the Mantel-
Haenszel method. According to data 
availability, we also calculated pooled 
adjusted ORs within each category 
using the estimated adjusted effect 
and its estimated SE (often obtained 
indirectly from the CI) reported in 
each study. Heterogeneity of the 
results among studies was tested 
with the quantity І2.26 A substantial 
level of heterogeneity was defined as 
an I2 ≥50%.26 We pooled results from 
individual studies using DerSimonian 
and Laird random-effects models27 
because substantial heterogeneity 
was present in most meta-analyses. 
We planned to explore potential 
3

CONDE-AGUDELO et al 
sources of heterogeneity, to perform 
subgroup and sensitivity analyses, 
and to assess publication and 
related biases if at least 10 studies 
were included in a meta-analysis. 
However, the limited number of 
studies allowed only the exploration 
of sources of heterogeneity according 
to study setting, sample size, and 
study quality.
For the relationship between 
birth spacing and other 
neurodevelopmental disabilities, we 
prepared a narrative synthesis on 
the basis of the overall results of the 
included studies because it was not 
possible to perform meta-analyses 
due to differences in measures of 
birth spacing, categories of intervals, 
reference categories, and outcome 
measures among the included 
studies.
All statistical analyses were 
performed by using Stata version 
12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, 
TX) and Review Manager (RevMan) 
version 5.3.5 (The Nordic Cochrane 
Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark) 
statistical packages.
RESULTS
Selection, Characteristics, and Risk 
of Bias of Studies
Figure 1 summarizes the process 
of identification and selection of 
studies. The searches produced 1678 
records, of which 88 were considered 
relevant. Of these, 76 were excluded, 
the main reason being lack of data 
on the relationship between birth 
spacing and neurodevelopmental 
disabilities considered. A total of 12 
studies (6 cohort, 5 cross-sectional, 
and 1 case-control), including 
1 334 569 children, met the inclusion 
criteria.28–39
The individual characteristics and 
main findings of the studies included 
in the systematic review are shown 
in Table 1. Seven studies provided 
data on ASD, 
28–34 3 on developmental 
delay, 
35–37 and 2 on cerebral palsy.38, 
39 
Six studies were conducted in the 
United States, 2 each in Canada and 
Brazil, and 1 each in Norway and 
Finland. Ten studies used IPI and 2 
used birth interval as measures of 
birth spacing. A “short interval” was 
defined in different ways, including 
IPIs of <3, <6, <12, <18, <24, and <36 
months and birth intervals of <19 
and <24 months. A “long interval” 
was defined as IPIs of ≥60, ≥72, and 
≥84 months. Most of the studies that 
assessed the relationship between 
IPI and ASD adjusted their results for 
maternal and paternal age, child’s 
gender, birth year, and at least 1 
measure of socioeconomic status. 
Five studies28, 
29, 
31, 
33, 
34 tested the 
effects of both preterm birth and low 
birth weight as potential mediators 
in the association between IPI 
and ASD risk. Among studies that 
evaluated the relationship between 
birth spacing and developmental 
delay and cerebral palsy, most 
of them included maternal age, 
measures of socioeconomic status, 
birth weight, gestational age, race/
ethnicity, and child’s gender as 
potential confounders/mediators 
in the adjusted models. The risk 
of bias for each included study is 
summarized in Fig 2. Seven studies 
met at least 5 of the criteria, 4 met 
4 of the criteria, and 1 met 3 of the 
criteria. The most common deficiency 
was the inadequate categorization of 
pregnancy intervals.

Autism Spectrum Disorder
Seven studies conducted in 
developed countries, considered 
to be at low risk of bias and that 
included 1 140 210 children in total, 
assessed the relationship between IPI 
and ASD.28–34 Three studies showed 
a U-shaped association between IPI 
and the risk of ASD.31, 
33, 
34 Six studies 
found a significant association 
between short IPIs (<12 months, 
30, 
31, 
33 
<18 months, 
29 <24 months, 
34 and 
<36 months28) and increased risk of 
ASD. The remaining study reported 
a nonsignificant greater risk of ASD 
among children born after an IPI 
of <12 months (adjusted OR 1.72, 
95% CI 0.96–3.06).32 However, a 
sensitivity analysis restricted to 
individuals with more severe ASD 
revealed a significant association 
between IPIs of <12 months and this 
disorder. Three studies also found 
a significant association between 
ASD and long IPIs (≥60 months, 
31 
≥72 months, 
34 and ≥84 months33). 
Five studies reported a significantly 
increased risk of the former subtype 
autistic disorder associated with 
short IPIs.28, 
30, 
31, 
33, 
34 No relationship 
was found between long IPIs and this 
disorder in 3 studies.28, 
31, 
33 However, 
long IPIs were found to be associated 
with an increased risk of the former 
subtypes Asperger disorder and 
PDD-NOS in 3 studies.31, 
33, 
34 Overall, 
there was no association between 
short IPIs and the risk of these 2 
disorders.30, 
31, 
33, 
34
Table 2 shows the meta-analyses 
of the association between IPI 
and ASD. Children born to women 
with IPIs of <12 months had a 
significantly increased risk of ASD 
when compared with children born 
to women with intervals of ≥36 
months (pooled adjusted OR 1.90, 
95% CI 1.16–3.09). This association 
was stronger for the former subtype 
autistic disorder (pooled adjusted OR 
2.62, 95% CI 1.53–4.50). There were 
no significant differences in the risk 
of ASD or autistic disorder between 
children conceived 12 to 35 months 
after a birth and those conceived ≥36 
months after a birth.

When we categorized IPIs into <12, 
12 to 23, 24 to 59, and ≥60 months, 
both short (<24 months) and long 
(≥60 months) IPIs were associated 
with a significantly increased risk 
of ASD (pooled unadjusted ORs 
[95% CIs]: 1.83 [1.33–2.54], 1.32 
[1.09–1.59], and 1.37 [1.02–1.86] for 
IPIs of <12, 12–23, and ≥60 months, 
respectively) as compared with 
IPIs of 24 to 59 months. IPIs of <24 
months were also associated with an 
increased risk of the former subtype 
autistic disorder (pooled unadjusted 
ORs [95% CIs]: 2.19 [1.66–2.88] 
and 1.51 [1.38–1.65] for IPIs of <12 
and 12–23 months, respectively). It 
was not possible to estimate pooled 
adjusted ORs for these categories of 
IPIs because the reference categories 
did not coincide among the studies.
Substantial statistical heterogeneity 
among studies was present, as 
confirmed by I2 values of ≥50% in 
most meta-analyses. A significant 
portion of the heterogeneity was 
explained by the study by Cheslack-
Postava et al.28 In fact, the exclusion 
of this study from the meta-analyses 
produced homogeneous pooled ORs 
(I2 = 0% for most meta-analyses), 
which were not significantly different 
from the overall estimates obtained 
from all studies (all P > .40; data not 
shown).
Developmental Delay
Three studies, considered to be at 
moderate risk of bias, evaluated the 
relationship between birth spacing 
and developmental delay.35–37 A 
large population-based study from 
the United States (N = 170 874)35 
found that short IPIs were associated 
with significantly increased risk of 
developmental delay or disability 
in the first 3 years of life. The risk 
of developmental delay decreased 
significantly for each 1-month 
increase in IPI since the birth of the 
previous sibling up to 60 months 
(OR for each 1-month increase in 
IPI 0.995, 95% CI 0.993–0.997). 
Two studies conducted in Brazil 
assessed the association between 
birth interval and suspected 
developmental delay at age 2 years37 
or up to age 6 years.36 Both studies 
found that short birth intervals (<19 
months36 and <24 months37) were 
associated with a significantly higher 
risk of suspected developmental 
delay (adjusted OR 3.90, 95% CI 
1.02–24.0836; adjusted RR 1.91, 95% 
CI 1.73–2.0937).
Cerebral Palsy
Two studies, rated as at moderate 
risk of bias, reported on the 
association between IPI and cerebral 
palsy.38, 
39 One study in 19 044 
children found that IPIs of <3 or 
>36 months were associated with 
a marginally significant increased 
risk of cerebral palsy (adjusted RR 
3.7, 95% CI 1.0–4.4).38 One small 
study (N = 375) reported that IPIs 
of <6 months were associated with 
a significantly increased risk of 
disabling cerebral palsy among 
infants who weighed 500 to 2000 g 
at birth (adjusted OR 2.7, 95% CI 
1.1–7.1).39
DISCUSSION
Main Findings
The results of our systematic 
review show that, overall, short 
IPIs (<12 months and, possibly, 12 
to 23 months) are independently 
associated with an increased risk 
of ASD, mainly the former subtype 
autistic disorder. This form is the 
most severe form of the conditions 
that comprise ASD because it is likely 
to co-occur with intellectual disability 
and a range of medical, behavioral, 
and psychiatric complications.40 In 
addition, there was growing evidence 
that children born to women with 
long IPIs, possibly >5 years, are at 
increased risk of ASD, mainly the 
former subtypes Asperger disorder 
and PDD-NOS. There was emerging 
evidence that short intervals are 
associated with an increased risk 
of developmental delay. Less clear 
was the association between short 
intervals and cerebral palsy.
The reasons for the association 
between a short IPI and ASD are 
unknown. The fact that the birth 
spacing effects were not attenuated 
when child’s gender, parental 
characteristics, and socioeconomic 
status were controlled for and that 
the IPI-ASD association was not 
mediated by preterm birth and low 
birth weight suggests that the effects 
are not caused by these confounding/
mediating factors. A plausible 
explanation is the maternal folate 
depletion hypothesis, which claims 
that maternal serum and erythrocyte 
concentrations of folate decrease 
from midpregnancy onward and 
remain low during 4 to 12 months 
postpartum. Women who become 
pregnant before folate restoration 
is complete have an increased risk 
of folate insufficiency at the time of 
conception and during pregnancy.16, 
41 
As a consequence, there would 
be an early alteration in the fetal 
neurodevelopment that could lead 
to ASD in early childhood.28 This 
hypothesis is reasonably supported 
by a recent, large population-based 
cohort study, which reported 
that periconceptional folic acid 
supplementation was associated with 
a significant reduction in the risk of 
autistic disorder in the offspring.42 
Interestingly, this study found that 
periconceptional supplementation 
of folic acid did not decrease the 
risk of Asperger disorder and PDD-
NOS, which were not found to be 
associated with short IPIs in our 
review. Another study30 found that 
the effect of short IPIs on the risk 
of autistic disorder appeared to be 
stronger in children whose mothers 
had not used folate before or during 
pregnancy, although this interaction 
was not statistically significant. Some 
cohort studies have reported that 
mothers who took periconceptional 
folic acid supplements had 
children with a reduced risk of 
neurodevelopmental disabilities, 
9

CONDE-AGUDELO et al 
such as severe language delay, 
behavioral problems, inattention, and 
hyperactivity and peer problems.43–46 
One relevant epigenetic process 
crucial to neurodevelopment is 
DNA methylation, which depends 
on the availability of dietary methyl 
donors such as folate, choline, and 
methionine. Insufficient folate intake 
can result in DNA hypomethylation, 
and hypomethylation is associated 
with potential neurodevelopmental 
consequences.47
Other mechanisms have been 
proposed to explain the increased 
risk of ASD associated with short 
intervals. Recent studies have shown 
that the majority of pregnancies after 
short intervals are unintended.48–50 
Moreover, unintended pregnancy 
is associated with a higher risk 
of prenatal maternal stress.51, 
52 
Gunnes et al30 hypothesized that 
closely spaced pregnancies would be 
associated with increased maternal 
stress during the pregnancy of the 
index child, which increases the 
likelihood of developing ASD in 
this child. Indeed, there is some 
evidence that prenatal maternal 
stress is a risk factor for ASD.53, 
54 In 
addition, a growing body of research 
suggests that early prenatal stress 
affects inhibitory neurons in the 
brain, which have been implicated 
in the pathophysiology of ASD.55 
An alternative mechanism could 
be through maternal inflammation 
because there is evidence of 
significant systemic inflammatory 
activity up to 9 to 10 weeks 
postpartum.56 It has been proposed 
that when conception occurs at 
relatively short intervals after 
delivery, it is possible that persistent 
maternal inflammation may affect 
fetal neurodevelopment.30, 
31 Finally, 
residual confounding may still be an 
explanation for this association.
Some hypotheses have also been 
proposed to explain the relationship 
between long intervals and ASD. It 
has been hypothesized that factors 
associated with long IPIs such as 
infertility, 
33, 
34 unintended pregnancy, 
31 and maternal inflammation31 could 
explain the link between long IPIs 
and risk of ASD.
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of our review are 
the rigorous methodology used, 
which adhered to the recommended 
guidelines for systematic reviews 
and meta-analysis of observational 
studies; the use of a prospective 
protocol designed to address a 
research question; the extensive 
literature searches without language 
restrictions; the exclusion of 
studies that did not adjust their 
effect estimates for potential 
confounding factors; the study 
quality assessment that was based 
on strict predetermined criteria; 
the inclusion of >1 million children 
in the studies that examined the 
association between IPI and ASD; 
and the quantitative and qualitative 
way of summarizing the evidence. 
Some limitations of this study 
should be acknowledged. First, 
there was an important degree of 
heterogeneity in most of the meta-
analyses performed; therefore, 
pooled estimates should be 
interpreted cautiously. We explored 
the sources of heterogeneity and 
found that it was explained mainly 
by the largest study.28 Nevertheless, 
the estimates of this study revealed 
the same direction of effect, which 
could suggest the absence of clinical 
heterogeneity among the studies. It 
is possible that the I2 heterogeneity 
test could have excessive power 
when there are studies with a very 
large sample size, as was the case 
with the study by Cheslack-Postava 
et al.28 Moreover, we used a random-
effects model to pool results from 
individual studies, which provides 
the most useful and conservative 
estimate for informing practice 
in the presence of heterogeneity. 
Second, several included studies 
focused on the association between 
short intervals and the adverse 
outcomes considered, and little 
attention was given to the issue of 
long intervals. In addition, some 
studies did not properly address 
the potential confounding effects 
of some variables as well as the 
mediating effects of gestational 
age or weight at birth. Failure to 
make appropriate adjustment for 
potential confounding factors could 
lead to spurious associations or to 
inaccurate estimates of the strength 
of any real associations. Third, 
the number of studies available 
for analysis on the association 
between birth spacing and both 
developmental delay and cerebral 
palsy is still too small for us to draw 
conclusions. In addition, despite the 
broad scope of the literature search 
strategy, we were not able to find 
studies assessing the association 
between birth spacing and other 
neurodevelopmental disabilities. 
Finally, it was not possible to 
quantitatively combine data from the 
different studies that assessed the 
association between birth spacing 
and both developmental delay and 
cerebral palsy. However, it must 
be emphasized that meta-analysis 
is not the objective of a systematic 
review.57
Clinical and Public Health 
Implications
The finding that short IPIs are 
associated with an increased risk of 
ASD, and possibly of developmental 
delay, has important clinical and 
public health implications in both 
high- and low/middle-income 
countries because it is a potentially 
modifiable risk factor. For example, 
in the United States, there is evidence 
that the proportion of births after 
short intervals has increased 
as a consequence of the higher 
frequency of delayed childbearing 
and compression of the childbearing 
years.48, 
58 In developing countries, 
approximately half of children are 
born after IPIs of <24 months.59 
Because advanced maternal age is 
also a well-recognized risk factor

for ASD, 
60 educating women and 
their families about healthy timing 
and spacing of pregnancy (20–35 
years of age61 and 24–59 months, 
62 
respectively) could contribute 
significantly, in both developed and 
developing countries, to a reduction 
in this neurodevelopmental disorder. 
In addition, promotion of healthy 
timing and spacing of pregnancy 
substantially improves the perinatal, 
child, and maternal health.62–64 The 
hypothetical impact of pregnancy 
spacing as an intervention to prevent 
ASD can be calculated by using the 
concept of population attributable-
risk percentage, which expresses 
the proportion of ASD in the study 
population that is attributable 
to short IPIs and thus could be 
eliminated if such exposure was 
eliminated. By using pooled data 
from 5 studies shown in the top 
section of Table 2, we estimated that 
if families choose to delay a new 
pregnancy for at least 24 months 
after the preceding birth, the rate 
of any ASD among non-firstborn 
children would decrease by 23.0%; 
if families choose to delay the new 
pregnancy for at least 12 months, the 
rate of any ASD would decrease by 
13.2%.
Implications for Research
Further studies will be needed to 
confirm the finding that long IPIs 
are also associated with increased 
risk of ASD, mainly the former 
subtypes Asperger disorder 
and PDD-NOS. Moreover, future 
studies should investigate the 
mechanisms underlying these 
associations and the possible 
modifier effect of periconceptional 
folic acid supplementation on the 
relationship between short IPIs and 
ASD. Finally, adequately powered 
studies that assess the relationship 
between birth spacing and other 
neurodevelopmental disabilities will 
also be required.
