ABSTRACT
Background: Studies have reported inconsistent findings on the asso-
ciation between dairy product intake and weight change and obesity.
Only a few prospective studies have investigated the role of dairy con-
sumption in both weight change and risk of becoming overweight or
obese and whether these associations depend on the initial body weight.
Objective: We prospectively investigated how dairy product intake
was associated with weight change and risk of becoming over-
weight or obese in initially normal-weight women.
Design: We studied 18,438 women aged $45 y from the Women’s
Health Study who were free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and di-
abetes and had initial body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) from 18.5 to ,25
at baseline. Dairy intake was assessed with the use of a 131-item food-
frequency questionnaire. Women self-reported body weight along with
obesity-related risk factors on baseline and annual follow-up question-
naires. At each follow-up time, women were categorized as normal weight
(BMI: 18.5 to ,25), overweight (BMI: 25 to ,30), or obese (BMI $30).
Results: During a mean follow-up of 11.2 y, 8238 women became
overweight or obese. Multivariable-adjusted mean 6 SD changes in
body weight during the follow-up (18 y) were 1.90 6 0.09, 1.88 6
0.08, 1.86 6 0.09, 1.82 6 0.09, and 1.65 6 0.09 kg in quintiles 1–5
of total dairy intake, respectively (P-trend = 0.003). Greater intake of
high-fat dairy products, but not intake of low-fat dairy products, was
associated with less weight gain (P-trend = 0.004). In multivariable-
adjusted analyses, lower risk of becoming overweight or obese was
observed in the highest quintile of high-fat dairy product intake (HR:
0.92, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.99). Dietary or supplemental calcium or vita-
min D was not associated with risk of becoming overweight or obese.
Conclusion: Greater consumption of total dairy products may be of im-
portance in the prevention of weight gain in middle-aged and elderly women
who are initially normal weight.

INTRODUCTION
Dairy products are widely consumed in the United States and in
other developed countries and have been recommended to meet
nutritional requirements for protein, vitamin D, calcium, potassium,
and other nutrients (1, 2). In contrast, dairy products may con-
tribute to excessive SFA and caloric intakes. As a result, the
current recommendation of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans is for individuals to consume 2–3 cups low-fat dairy
products/d (3). However, the evidence for dairy consumption in
chronic disease prevention has been questioned because of the
lack of well-powered randomized trials with enough follow-up
time to see effects on health outcomes (2).
Obesity remains a major public health concern; in the United
States, the NHANES has reported that more than one-third (34.9%)
of the US population were obese in 2011–2012 (4). Diet and
physical activity have been pointed out as important targets in the
prevention of weight gain and obesity development (5). In a meta-
analysis of 27 small-scale randomized controlled trials, which in-
cluded a total of 2101 women and men, higher dairy consumption
lowered body weight in the context of energy restriction in short-
term (,1 y) but not long-term ($1 y) trials (6). Prospective cohort
studies have reported mixed results, and the heterogeneity in se-
lected study populations on the basis of obesity status has compli-
cate the interpretation of these results (7–13). Moreover, a limited
number of prospective studies have investigated dairy consumption
with both weight change and risk of becoming overweight or obese
and whether these associations depend on initial body weight.
We aimed to prospectively investigate how consumption of
dairy products was associated with risk of becoming overweight or

 obese in a cohort of middle-aged and elderly women and whether
the association differed by low-fat and high-fat dairy intakes plus
the specific types of dairy products. We also investigated how
dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D, which are 2
major nutrients in dairy products, were associated with risk of
becoming overweight or obese.
METHODS
The Women’s Health Study was a 2 3 2 3 2 factorial trial of low-
dose aspirin, vitamin E, and b-carotene in the primary prevention of
cardiovascular disease and cancer in female US health professionals.
From 1992 to 1995, 39,876 women aged $45 y who were post-
menopausal or not intending to become pregnant and with no history
of myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or cancer
(except nonmelanoma skin cancer) provided information on a wide
range of lifestyle, clinical, and dietary factors. A total of 39,310
(98.6%) of the participating women also completed a 131-item val-
idated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (14, 15).
At baseline, women further provided self-reported information on
weight (lb) and height (in). Because we sought to investigate the
incidence of becoming overweight or obese, we restricted our
analyses to women with a baseline BMI (in kg/m2; calculated as
body weight divided by the square of height) of 18.5–25 (n =
20,106). We also excluded women who reported a history of di-
abetes (n = 1,143) or, at baseline, had missing information on dairy
intake, responded to an insufficient number of food items, or had
total energy intake outside the range of 600–3500 kcal/d. Our study
population for the analysis consisted of 18,438 women who were
followed through 28 February 2012. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants, and the research was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
Intakes of dairy products and dietary and supplemental
calcium and vitamin D
At baseline, women completed an FFQ that asked about how often
theyconsumed specific food items, on average, duringthe previousyear.
Nineresponsecategoriesrangingfromneverorlessthanoncepermonth
to $6 servings/d were included. For each food group, the average daily
intake (servings/d) was calculated by summing the intake frequency of
the specific items. Total dairy product intake was calculated by sum-
ming intake of low-fat dairy products (skim and low-fat milk, sherbet,
yogurt, and cottage and ricotta cheeses) and high-fat dairy products
(whole milk, cream, sour cream, ice cream, cream cheese, other
cheese, and butter). Dietary calcium and vitamin D intakes were
computed by multiplying the intake frequency by the nutrient content
of the specified portion size according to food-composition tables from
the Harvard T.H. Chang School of Public Health (16). Dietary calcium
and vitamin D intakes were energy-adjusted with the use of the
residual method (17). Women also self-reported the use of individual
or multivitamin supplements including calcium and vitamin D. The
validity of self-reported dairy product intake has been investigated
in similar cohorts of health professionals, and Pearson correlation
coefficients between the FFQ and 24-h dietary records were 0.79 for
skim milk, 0.62 for whole milk (18), and 0.68 for dietary calcium (19).
Other covariates
At baseline, women also provided information on age and
lifestyle factors such as smoking status, physical activity level,
postmenopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use. Physical
activity was based on the following 8 recreational activities:
walking and hiking; jogging; running; bicycling; aerobic exercise
and dance; lap swimming; tennis, squash, and racquetball; lower-
intensity exercise, yoga, stretching, and toning; and the number of
flights of stairs climbed daily. The metabolic equivalent task score
was calculated to reflect the energy expenditure of w1 kcal $ kg
body weight21 $ h21 (20). The correlation between self-reported
physical activity and four 1-wk activity diaries over 1 y was 0.62
in a similar population of women (21). Women also self-reported
information on clinical factors including a history of hypercho-
lesterolemia and hypertension. Dietary factors such as alcohol
intake, multivitamin use, and fruit and vegetable intake were es-
timated from the FFQ.
Development of overweight or obesity during follow-up
At the start of follow-up, we included all women with normal
weight (BMI: 18.5 to ,25). Body weight was updated on follow-up
questionnaires at years 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 11 and annually thereafter.
Changes in body weight between baseline and the different time
points as well as the end of intervention period (10 y) and obser-
vational period (17 y) were calculated. At each follow-up time
point, women were categorized as normal weight (BMI: 18.5 to
,25), overweight (BMI: 25 to ,30), or obese (BMI $30) (22). In
the analysis of risk of becoming overweight or obese, women were
followed from baseline to the date of the questionnaire on which
they first reported a weight that corresponded to being overweight
or obese, their date of death, or the end of follow-up, whichever
occurred first. The validity between self-reported and standardized
measurements of body weight taken by technicians has been shown
to be high in similar cohort of female health professionals with
a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.97 (15).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.3
software (SAS Institute Inc.) and Stata version 13.1 software
(StataCorp LP). We categorized women into quintiles of total, low-
fat, or high-fat dairy intake as well as quintiles of dietary calcium
and vitamin D intakes. We also categorized women on the basis of
calcium and vitamin D supplement dosages. Age-standardized
mean values 6 SDs for continuous variables and percentages for
categorical variables were calculated and compared across cate-
gories. Linear trends were calculated with the use of an ANOVA
for continuous and categorical variables.
Multivariable-adjusted weight changes (kg) and 95% CIs be-
tween baseline and different follow-up time points within quintiles
of total dairy intake were estimated with the use of a multilevel
mixed-effects linear regression model with the assumption of
a Gaussian residual structure with one commonvariance. Restricted
cubic spline analyses modeled the body weight change (lb) within
quintiles 1 and 5 of total dairy intake. Cox proportional hazards
models were used to calculate HRs (95% CIs) of becoming
overweight or obese (23). All HRs were adjusted for baseline age
(y; continuous), smoking status (never, past, or currently smoking
,15 or $15 cigarettes/d), physical activity (energy expenditure in
metabolic equivalent task hours per week), postmenopausal status
(no, yes, biologically uncertain, or unclear), use of hormone re-
placement therapy (never, past, or current), history of hypertension

 (yes or no), history of hypercholesterolemia (yes or no), alcohol
consumption (rarely or never, 1–3 drinks/mo, 1–6 drinks/wk, or
$1 drink/wk), and caloric intake (kcal/d). Baseline BMI (con-
tinuous) was finally added to all models. Linear trends across
quintiles were tested with the use of the median value of each
quintile as an ordinal variable. In a sensitivity analysis, we
calculated the person-time by also censoring on the date of di-
abetes diagnosis during follow-up to avoid possible influence on
weight control because of new diabetes diagnosis.
To investigate the effect modification by important lifestyle
factors related to dairy consumption and risk of becoming over-
weight or obese, we performed stratified analyses by age, baseline
BMI, smoking status, and physical activity. We tested for in-
teractions with the use of Wald’s chi-square tests. The proportional
hazards assumption was tested by entering the product of baseline
intakes of total dairy intake and the ln of time in the model. There
was evidence of a violation of this assumption (P = 0.0007). Two-
sided P values ,0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Background characteristics
During an mean of 11.2 y of follow up, 8238 of 18,438 women
became overweight or obese. In Table 1, we present baseline
characteristics of the women according to quintiles of total dairy
intake. Women in the highest quintile of total dairy intake com-
pared with those in the lowest had significantly higher age,
physical activity, total calorie intake, and fruit and vegetable
intake and were more likely to consume $1 alcoholic drink/mo
and to use multivitamin supplements. These women were also
significantly less likely to be current smokers, be current users of
hormone replacement therapy, or have a history of hypercho-
lesterolemia and hypertension.
Dairy intake in association with weight change
In Table 2, the longitudinal changes in body weight between
baseline and the end of observational period (17 y) are presented
according to quintiles of consumption of total, high-fat, and low-fat
dairy products. The multivariable adjusted mean 6 SE changes in
body weight during follow-up were 1.90 6 0.09, 1.88 6 0.09,
1.86 6 0.09, 1.82 6 0.09, and 1.65 6 0.09 kg in quintiles 1–5 of
total dairy intake, respectively (P-trend = 0.003). A similar sig-
nificant trend was observed for high-fat dairy intake (P-trend =
0.004) but not for low-fat dairy intake (P-trend = 0.36). Addi-
tional adjustment for baseline BMI marginally changed the re-
sults. Moreover, when dietary fiber was added to the model,
similar results were observed (data not shown). In sensitivity
analyses, we investigated whether intakes of butter and cream
were driving the associations for high-fat dairy intake by ex-
cluding these items from this variable. As a result, the association
was somewhat attenuated, but a significant trend remained in each
model, including the multivariable-adjusted model with the ad-
dition of baseline BMI (P-trend = 0.04). We further investigated
the association between dairy intake and weight change at the end

 of the intervention period (10 y) and observed similar trend for
intakes of high-fat dairy products (P-trend = 0.002) but a non-
significant trend for total intake of dairy products (P-trend = 0.14)
and intake of low-fat dairy products (P-trend = 0.36) (Supple-
mental Table 1). In Figure 1, we show the mean change in body
weight within quintiles 1 and 5 of total dairy consumption for the
different follow-up time points. During follow-up, an increase in
body weight was observed regardless of total dairy intake; how-
ever, women who consumed greater total dairy products gained
less weight than did women who consumed fewer total dairy
products. Weight changes within quintile 1 were 1.8, 2.8, and
3.0 kg at years 5, 10, and 15, respectively. The corresponding
weight changes for quintile 5 were 1.8, 2.5, and 2.5 kg, re-
spectively. In mixed-modeling analyses, there was a significant
interaction between total dairy intake and the follow-up time on
the changes in body weight (P , 0.0001).
Dairy intake and risk of becoming overweight or obese
In age-adjusted analyses (Table 3), we observed that women in
the highest quintile of total dairy intake ($3.1 servings/d) com-
pared with women in the lowest quintile of total dairy intake
(,1.0 servings/d) had lower risk of becoming overweight or obese
(HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.97; P-trend = 0.002). In the highest
compared with the lowest quintile of high-fat dairy intake, the
age-adjusted HR was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.96; P-trend = 0.0003),
whereas no association was observed for low-fat dairy intake.
Adjustment for other lifestyle, clinical, and dietary factors
weakened the associations for total dairy and high-fat dairy in-
takes, but increased risk of becoming overweight or obese was
observed in the highest quintile of low-fat dairy intake (HR: 1.10;
95% CI: 1.02, 1.18). When BMI was added to the model, the results
were attenuated. The addition of dietary fiber did not change the
results. We further investigated, in a sensitivity analysis, whether
risk of becoming overweight or obese was affected by censoring for
diabetes during follow-up, and similar associations were observed
for total, low-fat, and high-fat dairy intakes (data not shown). In the
multivariable-adjusted model, there were no significant associations
observed for the highest compared with lowest quintiles of total
dairy intake (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.29; P-trend = 0.32) or low-
fat dairy intake (HR: 1.12; 9%% CI: 0.91, 1.38 P-trend = 0.21),
whereas a tendency toward a linear trend was observed for high-fat

ditional adjustment of baseline BMI showed similar results. We also
investigated whether intakes of butter and cream were driving the
associations for high-fat dairy product intake by excluding these
items from the variable. In the multivariable-adjusted model, the HR
of becoming overweight or obese in women in the highest com-
pared with lowest quintiles of high-fat dairy product intake was 0.94
(95% CI: 0.88, 1.02; P-trend = 0.10). When BMI was added to the
model, the results were further attenuated.
Because we observed that the association between total dairy
product intake and weight change varied by the follow-up time,
we performed sensitivity analyses on risk of becoming overweight
or obese by ending the follow-up after 8 y, which reflected the
time point that was approximately halfway through the follow-up
(Supplemental Table 2). In the multivariable-adjusted model that
include BMI, no associations were observed for total dairy product
intake (HR in the highest quintile: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.12; P-
trend = 0.83) and high-fat dairy intake (HR in the highest quintile:
0.91; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.995; P-trend = 0.04). However, significant
increased risk was observed for low-fat dairy intake (HR in the
highest quintile: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.26; P-trend = 0.009).
In stratified analyses, we investigated whether the association
between total dairy product intake varied by factors such as
baseline age, BMI, smoking status, and physical activity (Table
4). We did not find any evidence of an effect modification for
any of these factors (all P-interaction $ 0.10).
Types of dairy products and risk of becoming overweight
or obese
We investigated specific types of dairy products and risk of
becoming overweight and obese (Table 5). Higher risks were
observed for $1 servings/d compared with 0 servings/d of the
following products: skimmed milk (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.19;
P-trend = 0.03), sherbet (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.42; P-trend =
0.003), and yogurt (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.31; P-trend =
0.001). Additional adjustment for baseline BMI attenuated the
associations for skimmed milk and sherbet but not for yogurt.
Dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D and risk
of becoming overweight or obese
Results for how dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin
D, which are nutrients in dairy products, were associated with risk
of becoming overweight or obese are presented in Table 6. In age-
adjusted analyses, the use of calcium supplements ($1000 mg/d)
compared with no use was associated with an HR of 0.88 (95%
CI: 0.81, 0.95; P-trend , 0.0001). A similar association was ob-
served in the multivariable-adjusted analyses. However, the addi-
tion of BMI to the model completely attenuated the association. In
the multivariable-adjusted model, higher dietary vitamin D intake
($330 IU/d) tended to be associated with higher risk of becoming
overweight or obese (HR: 1.08, 95 CI: 1.00, 1.17; P-trend = 0.09),
but the association was, once again, attenuated after additional
adjustment for BMI.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective cohort of middle-aged and older, initially
normal-weight women, increased body weight over time was ob-
served across all categories of total dairy intake; however, women
with higher intake of dairy products had less weight gain, which
seemed to be driven by high-fat dairy intake. When we investigated
risk of becoming overweight or obese, an inverse association was

DAIRY CONSUMPTION AND WEIGHT

 observed for high-fat dairy intake but not for total dairy intake or
low-fat dairy intake as well as for specific dairy products or dietary
nutrients present in dairy products such as calcium or vitamin D.
Note that our results apply to women who were initially normal
weight and not to those who were initially overweight or obese.
Thus, different results may have been observed because baseline
BMI may be associated with the amount and types of dairy products
consumed as well as to baseline risk of becoming more overweight
or obese. Initial body weight is an important consideration when
examining the role of dietary exposures in weight change. However,
in our analyses, there was little evidence for a confounding effect
from baseline BMI when we examined total, low-fat, and high-fat
dairy product intakes as well as intakes of individual dairy products
except for skimmed milk and sherbet intakes. However, it will be
important to consider other results in other populations on the basis
of sex, initial weight status, and ethnicity (24).
There have been several randomized trials and other prospective
cohort studies that have investigated whether dairy intake is as-
sociated with weight change or obesity, and they have reported
inconsistent results (6–13, 25, 26). The heterogeneity according to
baseline obesity status in the different study populations adds to the
complexity of making an overall interpretation of the potential role
of dairy intake in weight-gain prevention and risk of becoming
overweight or obese. Moreover, a limited number of prospective
studies have investigated dairy consumption both on weight change
and risk of becoming overweight or obese and whether these as-
sociations depend on the initial body weight. A meta-analyses of
27 randomized trials with a total of 2101 participants suggested
that increasing dairy consumption in the context of energy re-
striction may reduce body weight according to short-term trial
(,1 y) but not to long-term trials ($1 y) (6).
In our study, we observed modest reductions in weight gain and
risk of becoming overweight or obese. However, we believe these
results are clinically meaningful because they reflected average
estimates in a large population followed for a long time. We
observed that higher intakes of high-fat dairy products but not of

 low-fat dairy products were associated with less weight gain,
which seemed to be driven by intakes of whole-fat milk and butter.
This result may seem to be a contradictory finding because low-fat
dairy products are typically recommended for energy restriction.
However, our study population was restricted to women who were
normal weight at baseline and may, for the most part, have not been

milk were associated with less weight gain over 4-y periods,
which is in line with our findings. However, higher butter intake
was associated with a 4-y weight gain in the Nurse’s Health
Study, the Nurse’s Health Study II, and the Health Professionals
Follow-Up Study (7). In the Framingham Heart Study Offspring
Cohort, higher total dairy and yogurt intakes were associated with
less weight and waist circumference gains over a 9-y period (25).
These results are consistent with our findings on total dairy intake
but not on yogurt intake, whereby we observed increased risk of
becoming overweight or obese with higher intake. Moreover, in
a Spanish cohort of women and men who were normal weight at
baseline, yogurt intake was associated with lower risk of be-
coming overweight or obese (26). In a cohort of French adults,
intakes of total dairy products, milk, cheese, and yogurt were not
associated with a 6-y weight change in women and men who were
normal weight at baseline; however, in overweight adults, there
was less weight gain in those who had higher intakes of total
dairy products, milk, and yogurt (8). In Swedish women with
a constant intake of $1 serving whole/sour milk, and cheese/
d had lower risk of gaining $1 kg/y than were women with
constant lower intake of these products during a 10-y follow-up
(9). When baseline BMI was stratified for, the association for
whole milk and sour milk was only apparent in women of normal
weight, but because sour milk is not typically available on the US
market, it is hard to compare these results with our observed
findings.
Dairy products contain several components that may con-
tribute to less weight gain and lower risk of becoming overweight
or obese including proteins, vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus
(1, 2). Calcium has been suggested to play a key role in energy
metabolism by forming insoluble soaps or binding bile acids (27).
Moreover, calcium may play a key role in intracellular pathways
both directly and indirectly through 1.25-dihydroxy vitamin D
and calcitriols (28). However, dietary or supplemental calcium
and vitamin D seemed not to be associated with risk of becoming
overweight or obese in our analyses when baseline BMI was
controlled for. The role of dietary and supplemental calcium and
vitamin D has not been well studied in overweight and obesity
prevention. Clinical trials have mostly focused on weight changes
in women and men who were overweight or obese at baseline,
whereas few studies have investigated long-term longitudinal
weight changes (29, 30). Our results of no associations with

 dietary and supplemental calcium are in agreement with findings
from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, which observed
no associations for the 12-y weight change in 23,504 men (31).
There has been some concern that dairy products may contribute
to excessive intakes of SFAs and calories, thereby causing people
to consume reduced-fat products. However, in our analyses, we
observed that high-fat dairy products but not low-fat dairy
products were inversely associated with weight gain and risk of
becoming overweight or obese.
The current study had several strengths. The study was
conducted in a large prospective cohort with a long follow-up.
Women in the study provided high-quality, self-reported in-
formation for a wide-range of lifestyle, clinical, and dietary
factors. Moreover, measures of body weight were updated at
several time points during follow-up. However, the current
study also had important potential limitations to consider. Self-
reported body-weight may be associated with a nondifferential
misclassification, which, in turn, could have biased our risk
estimates most likely toward the null (32). However, the
validity of self-reported weight has been estimated to be very high
(15). Moreover, a measurement error may influence self-reported
dairy product consumption. We could not exclude a potential
effect of survival bias for the weight-change results because these
analyses included women who survived the intervention period
and agreed to participate in the observational follow-up period.
Although we had detailed information on a wide range of po-
tential confounders, residual confounding may have affected our
results. We did not have information on whether women were
restricting their calorie intakes, which may have influenced our
results. Moreover, in this study, we investigated whether high
dairy product intake was associated with a weight change and risk
of becoming overweight or obese in women who were initially
normal weight; thus, our observed findings are not generalizable
to women who are overweight or obese. Finally, women in our
study were predominantly Caucasian and were health pro-
fessionals, and thus, these results may not be generalizable to
other populations.
In conclusion, in this prospective study of middle-aged and
older women with normal BMI at baseline, higher total dairy
intake was associated with less weight gain. These findings
seemed to be driven by high-fat dairy intake. Future studies,
especially well-powered, longer-term randomized trials, are
needed to better understand the role of dairy products in the
prevention of weight gain and risk of becoming overweight or
obese.
The authors’ responsibilities were as follows—SR, LW, I-ML, JEB, and
HDS: conducted the research; SR and HDS: designed the research and wrote
the manuscript; HDS: had primary responsibility for the final content of the
manuscript; and all authors: analyzed the data and read and approved the
final manuscript. None of the authors reported a conflict of interest related to
the study.
