Abstract
Background
Information about genetic and phenotypic risk of type 2 diabetes is now widely available and
is being incorporated into disease prevention programs. Whether such information moti-
vates behavior change or has adverse effects is uncertain. We examined the effect of com-
municating an estimate of genetic or phenotypic risk of type 2 diabetes in a parallel group,
open, randomized controlled trial.
Methods and Findings
We recruited 569 healthy middle-aged adults from the Fenland Study, an ongoing popula-
tion-based, observational study in the east of England (Cambridgeshire, UK). We used a
computer-generated random list to assign participants in blocks of six to receive either stan-
dard lifestyle advice alone (control group, n = 190) or in combination with a genetic (n = 189)
or a phenotypic (n = 190) risk estimate for type 2 diabetes (intervention groups). After 8 wk,
we measured the primary outcome, objectively measured physical activity (kJ/kg/day), and
also measured several secondary outcomes (including self-reported diet, self-reported
weight, worry, anxiety, and perceived risk). The study was powered to detect a between-
group difference of 4.1 kJ/kg/d at follow-up. 557 (98%) participants completed the trial. There
were no significant intervention effects on physical activity (difference in adjusted mean
change from baseline: genetic risk group versus control group 0.85 kJ/kg/d (95% CI −2.07 to
3.77, p = 0.57); phenotypic risk group versus control group 1.32 (95% CI −1.61 to 4.25, p =

 0.38); and genetic risk group versus phenotypic risk group −0.47 (95% CI −3.40 to 2.46, p =
0.75). No significant differences in self-reported diet, self-reported weight, worry, and anxiety
were observed between trial groups. Estimates of perceived risk were significantly more
accurate among those who received risk information than among those who did not. Key limi-
tations include the recruitment of a sample that may not be representative of the UK popula-
tion, use of self-reported secondary outcome measures, and a short follow-up period.
Conclusions
In this study, we did not observe short-term changes in behavior associated with the com-
munication of an estimate of genetic or phenotypic risk of type 2 diabetes. We also did not
observe changes in worry or anxiety in the study population. Additional research is needed
to investigate the conditions under which risk information might enhance preventive strate-
gies. (Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN09650496; Date applied: April 4, 2011; Date

Author Summary
Why Was This Study Done?
• Despite questions regarding their clinical validity and utility, genetic tests aimed at pre-
dicting risk of type 2 diabetes are now widely available.
• Some researchers and direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies are optimistic that
personalized genetic information will encourage people at risk to adopt healthier behav-
ior than standard advice about lifestyle, but scientific evidence is needed.
What Did the Researchers Do and Find?
• The researchers calculated the risk of developing type 2 diabetes for 569 healthy middle-
aged adults.
• The risk estimates were either based on a participant’s genetic makeup, as judged by
presence of genetic information known to be associated with type 2 diabetes, or on phe-
notypic characteristics, such as sex, age, body mass index, etc.
• Participants were randomly assigned to three groups to receive standard lifestyle advice,
alone or in combination with their genetic risk estimate or phenotypic risk estimate.
After 8 wk, participants’ physical activity, self-reported diet and weight, anxiety, worry,
and beliefs about their risk were measured.
• The researchers found that receipt of a genetic or phenotypic risk estimate did not affect
participants’ physical activity or other relevant behaviors, in comparison with those
receiving standard lifestyle advice. However, perception of risk became more accurate.

 What Do These Findings Mean?
• In this study, provision of personalized information about genetic or phenotypic risk of
type 2 diabetes did not affect behavior when compared with standard lifestyle advice.
• Provision of personalized information about risk of type 2 diabetes did not seem to
cause anxiety.
• More research is needed to understand the circumstances in which genetic risk infor-
mation might motivate behavior change.
Introduction
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide, and primary prevention of the dis-
ease is a global priority [1]. Evidence from randomized controlled trials shows that positive
changes in health behavior can significantly reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes among
those considered high-risk [2,3]. However, translating these findings into preventive strategies
has proven difficult, as it requires motivation of individuals to adopt and maintain changes in
physical activity and diet [4].
Risk of type 2 diabetes is also influenced by genetics. Despite questions regarding the clini-
cal validity and utility of recently developed predictive genetic tests [5,6], some researchers and
direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies are optimistic that the provision of genetic risk
information for type 2 diabetes will motivate behavior change more than widely available phe-
notypic risk information [7–9]. This hypothesis has support from health behavior theory
[10,11]. However, there is concern about the potential negative psychological impact of widely
available genetic risk information including fatalism, anxiety, and false reassurance [12–14].
Furthermore, there is evidence that risk perceptions and communication of biomarker infor-
mation have limited influence on behavior [15,16].
There are few clinical studies concerning the impact of genetic risk information [17]. The
majority have been nonrandomized or underpowered. Furthermore, interpretation has been
limited by risk of bias and additional differences between study groups than merely the provi-
sion of DNA-based disease risk information. Two recent trials report no behavioral impact of
information about the genetic risk of type 2 diabetes [18,19]. However, neither included pre-
cise measures of behavior. In addition, Grant et al. recruited a small sample of individuals will-
ing to participate in an intensive diabetes prevention program [19], and Voils et al. did not
include a control group receiving no phenotypic risk information [18].
We examined the effect of communicating genetic or phenotypic risk of type 2 diabetes in
combination with standard lifestyle advice on objectively-measured physical activity, self-
reported diet, self-reported weight, anxiety, and several cognitive and emotional theory-based
antecedents of behavior change in a sample of healthy middle-aged adults.
Methods
Details regarding the trial methods have been reported previously [20]. We obtained ethical
approval from the Cambridgeshire 1 Research Ethics Committee (No. 10/H0304/78). Each
participant provided written informed consent. The trial is registered with Current Controlled
Trials (ISRCTN09650496; Date applied: April 4, 2011; Date assigned: June 10, 2011).

 Participant Screening and Recruitment
We recruited participants from the Fenland Study, an ongoing population-based observational
study investigating the influence of lifestyle and genetic factors on the development of diabetes,
obesity, and related metabolic disorders [21]. Individuals born between 1950 and 1975 regis-
tered with participating general practices in Cambridgeshire, UK were invited to take part.
General practitioners excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes, a terminal illness with a
prognosis of less than one year, a psychotic illness, being pregnant or lactating, or being unable
to walk unaided. Fenland Study participants undergo a health assessment, and blood samples
are collected for the genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with
type 2 diabetes. At the end of the assessment, participants are fitted with a combined heart rate
monitor and accelerometer (Actiheart) [22], which they are instructed to wear continuously
for six days and nights to measure physical activity.
We sent invitations to take part in the Diabetes Risk Communication Trial (DRCT) to Fen-
land Study participants who 1) had agreed to be contacted regarding future studies, 2) had suf-
ficient data to calculate their genetic and phenotypic risk of type 2 diabetes, 3) wore the
combined heart rate monitor and accelerometer for three or more full days without experienc-
ing a severe skin reaction, and 4) provided at least 36 h of complete physical activity data.
Upon response, we excluded those who reported being diagnosed with diabetes or actively par-
ticipating in another study.
Randomization and Blinding
We randomly allocated eligible participants who completed a baseline questionnaire to one of
three groups that received either standard lifestyle advice alone (control group) or in combina-
tion with a genetic or a phenotypic risk estimate for type 2 diabetes (intervention groups). A
statistician without knowledge of participant characteristics created a computer-generated list
comprised of blocks of six that contained two of each of the three study groups per block in a
random order. This was incorporated into an automated randomization computer program.
Allocation was concealed from the researchers and participants until the interventions were
assigned. Researchers assessing the primary outcome remained blinded to the allocation of
participants throughout the study.
Interventions
All participants received standard written lifestyle advice, which included a brief description of
type 2 diabetes and an explanation of the risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and
consequences of the disease. We informed participants that the disease is preventable and
encouraged them to maintain a healthy weight and to adhere to United Kingdom governmen-
tal guidelines for physical activity and diet [23,24].
The interventions were designed to incorporate evidence regarding the most effective
methods for communicating disease risk estimates [25]. As it remains unclear whether an indi-
vidual’s understanding of risk is more accurate after the provision of a numerical risk estimate
or a verbal risk estimate [26,27], both the genetic and phenotypic risk estimates included esti-
mates of the participant’s lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes expressed as a percentage
and verbal estimation of risk (i.e., “below average,” “average,” or “above average”). Moreover,
research suggests that comparative risk estimates may have a greater influence on behavior
than absolute risk estimates [28,29], and that visual representations of risk elicit greater recall
and understanding of risk [26,30,31]. Thus, estimates were framed in comparison to the aver-
age risk within each participant’s age and sex-specific group, and participants were told what

 percentage of the study sample had a risk estimate higher, lower, and equal to their own. Each
piece of information was represented using a visual scales [27].
Methods for calculating the genetic and phenotypic risk estimates have been described in
detail previously [20]. We calculated genetic risk using methods similar to those outlined by
several direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies [32–34]. The 23 SNPs utilized in the cal-
culation were identified through adequately powered genome-wide association studies, had
associations with type 2 diabetes that reached the genome-wide significance level (p-values for
associations less than 5x10−8), and had associations that were replicated in at least one inde-
pendently published study. We took the odds ratio for each SNP from replication samples and
the allele frequency from the HapMap population. We calculated phenotypic risk using the
Cambridge Diabetes Risk Score [35,36]. Age, sex, smoking status, family history of diabetes,
and prescription of steroid or antihypertensive medication were assessed via questionnaire.
We measured height and weight using standardized procedures and calculated body mass
index as weight (in kg) divided by the square of height (in m). All data used in the estimation
of risk were collected during the participant’s Fenland Study health assessment.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was physical activity, defined as physical activity energy expenditure
(kJ/kg/d), measured objectively using the Actiheart continuously for six days and night [22].
We used a submaximal exercise test for individual calibration of heart rate response [37] and a
branched equation model to estimate physical activity energy expenditure from acceleration
and heart rate [38]. This approach has high validity for estimating the intensity of physical
activity [39,40] and overcomes some of the key limitations associated with either accelerome-
ters or heart rate monitors alone [22].
Baseline physical activity was measured in the Fenland Study (median 1.76 years prior to
enrollment in the DRCT), and follow-up occurred 8 wk postintervention. This relatively short
follow-up period was chosen on the basis that it is unlikely that a long-term effect would exist
in the absence of an impact in the short term. All prespecified secondary outcomes were mea-
sured via questionnaire and included self-reported diet, self-reported weight, self-rated health,
worry (measured at baseline and follow-up), anxiety, behavioral intention, perceived risk, self-
efficacy, response efficacy, perceived severity, and diabetes risk representations (measured at
baseline, immediately post receipt of the intervention, and follow-up; more details are available
in S1 Appendix).
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis (i.e., analysis of data according to
randomized study group, regardless of whether or not the intervention was received) using
STATA software [41]. We used univariate descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations
[SDs], numbers, and percentages) to summarise the characteristics of the study sample at base-
line. We used analysis of covariance to assess differences between groups in physical activity at
follow-up, adjusted for baseline. Prespecified exploratory analyses were conducted to examine
whether sex, age, body mass index, time since the Fenland Study, and baseline measurements
of the trial outcomes moderated the intervention effects on physical activity. A further sub-
group analysis explored whether a high or low risk estimate moderated the effect of the type of
risk estimate (i.e., genetic or phenotypic) on physical activity. The study protocol and statistical
analysis plan specified that the analyses should include only participants with complete postin-
tervention or follow-up data (i.e., a complete case analysis). We included participants with
missing baseline data in the analyses using the missing-indicator method [42]. Similar

 regression procedures were used to examine differences in all secondary outcomes. The
acceptability of the interventions was assessed by summarizing recruitment rates, loss to fol-
low-up, and reasons for loss to follow-up. Additionally, differences in responses to questions
regarding the perceived accuracy of the risk estimates, as well as the retention and discussion
of the risk estimates were examined.
Estimates used in the sample size calculation were taken from the Feedback, Awareness and
Behavior (FAB) study, which had a similar sample population and the same primary outcome
as proposed here (i.e., physical activity energy expenditure) [43]. The mean (SD) physical
activity energy expenditure at follow-up in the FAB study was 46.2 (15.4) kJ/kg/d, and the cor-
relation between baseline and follow-up was high (0.69). After making a Bonferroni adjust-
ment for multiple comparisons in a three-group trial, we determined that in order to detect a
between-group difference of 4.1 kJ/kg/d at follow-up (which equates to approximately 20 to 25
min of walking per day), with 98.3% significance and 80% power, approximately 465 partici-
pants would need to complete the trial [44,45]. We conservatively allowed for an attrition rate
of 20% and targeted the recruitment of 580 participants.
Results
Participant Characteristics
Between February 11, 2011 and September 5, 2011, we sent invitations to take part in the
DRCT to 1150 Fenland Study volunteers and 635 (55%) replied positively and were assessed
for eligibility. Between March 8, 2011 and September 14, 2011, 569 (49%) participants were
randomized (Fig 1). Reasons for exclusion included not responding after an initial positive
reply (68%), responding after enrollment closed (12%), being unavailable prior to the expected
trial completion date (8%), reporting a rash while wearing the Actiheart during the Fenland
Study (1%), participating in another study (6%), and being diagnosed with diabetes (5%).
Those who did not reply and those who were excluded from participation did not differ from
those randomized according to sex, body mass index, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) or phe-
notypic risk. However, they were slightly younger than participants at the time of their Fenland
Study health assessment (mean [SD] age 45.0 [6.9] y versus 47.2 [7.4] y) and had a higher
genetic lifetime risk estimate (mean [SD] of 18.8% [8.2%] versus 17.8% [8.1%]).
After randomization, 12 (2.1%) participants were lost to follow-up, and we excluded 7
(1.2%) from the primary analysis because they had insufficient physical activity data (the mon-
itor did not record more than three days of data) (Fig 1). The complete case sample comprised
550 participants: 184 received standard lifestyle advice alone, 184 received standard lifestyle
advice and a genetic risk estimate, and 182 received standard lifestyle advice and a phenotypic
risk estimate.
Outcomes
There were no significant between-group differences in objectively measured physical activity
at the 8-wk follow-up (Fig 2). Prespecified exploratory analyses showed that the interventions
had no effect on physical activity within subgroups defined by age, body mass index, physical
activity, self-reported diet, self-reported weight, self-rated health, behavioral intention, per-
ceived risk, anxiety, worry, time since participation in the Fenland Study, or receipt of a high
or low risk estimate (Table A in S1 Appendix). However, when compared to the control
group, the genetic risk estimate was associated with a greater increase in physical activity
among women than among men (women: β = 4.29, 95% CI = 0.27 to 8.33, p = 0.037; men:
β = −2.69, 95% CI = −6.92 to 1.55, p = 0.213). The phenotypic risk estimate did not have a

 differential effect by sex (women: β = 1.70, 95% CI = −2.45 to 5.86, p = 0.421; men: β = 1.33,
95% CI = −2.75 to 5.41, p = 0.523).
No significant differences were observed between trial groups in self-reported diet, self-
reported weight, self-rated health, and worry at follow-up, nor were there any significant dif-
ferences in behavioral intention and anxiety immediately postintervention or at follow-up
(Tables 2 and 3). Participants who received a risk estimate had a lower perceived risk immedi-
ately postintervention than those who did not receive an estimate. These effects were attenu-
ated at follow-up, but remained statistically significant, and did not differ by the type of risk
estimate received (Tables 2 and 3). Additionally, immediately postintervention, both diet
response efficacy and illness understanding were significantly lower in the phenotypic risk
group compared to the control group, and perceived severity was significantly lower in the
genetic risk group compared to the control group (Tables 2 and 3).
Among those who received a risk estimate, the majority (93.0%) reported that they believed
their risk estimate to be either fairly or very accurate. Most participants (90.5%) stated that
they had kept their risk estimate, and many (63.7%) reported discussing it with others (for
example family members, friends, or health professionals).
Fig 1. Flow of participants through the DRCT. Baseline characteristics were similar among the three study groups (Table 1). There were
slightly more female (52.9%) than male participants. The mean (SD) age at which participants finished full-time education was 19.4 (4.4) y and
most were employed full-time (68.0%). Overall, 10.6% were current smokers, and 26.8% consumed more than 11 units of alcohol per wk. Few
participants were prescribed steroid or antihypertensive medication (5.8%) or had a positive family history for diabetes (23.0%). On average,
participants were overweight (mean [SD] body mass index of 26.1 [4.2] kg/m2), but their HbA1c level was in the normal range (mean [SD] of 36.3
[4.4] mmol/mol).

 Discussion
In a sample of healthy, middle-aged men and women who were given information about type
2 diabetes and standard lifestyle advice, there was no effect of communicating a genetic or phe-
notypic estimate of the risk of developing type 2 diabetes on objectively measured physical
activity. We did not observe significant intervention effects on self-reported diet and weight,
self-rated health, behavioral intentions, anxiety, or worry. This is an important observation,
given the expectations that such communications might facilitate behavior change and the
concerns about the potential adverse psychological consequences of predictive genetic testing.
We also did not observe significant intervention effects on a range of other cognitive and emo-
tional theory-based antecedents to behavior change. We examined several potential modera-
tors, and only sex was found to interact with the intervention effect on physical activity, raising
the possibility that genetic risk information may be more influential among women than
among men. More research is needed to explore whether women and men respond differently
to genetic risk information.
Risk information was received and understood, and had a sustained effect on participants’
perceptions of their risk. However, the volunteers tended to overestimate their risk at baseline
and may therefore have been somewhat reassured by the information that they received, albeit
not to the extent that they adopted unhealthy behaviors [46]. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude

Plus–minus values are means ± SE. Diet was defined as self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption measured via the Food Frequency Questionnaire. Self-rated health was
measured on a scale (from 1 to 4), with higher values indicating a poorer rating of health. Worry was measured using an adapted version of the Cancer Worry Scale (from 6 to 24),
with higher values indicating greater type 2 diabetes related worry. Anxiety was measured using the short-form of the state scale of the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (from
20 to 80), with higher values indicating greater anxiety. Intention was measured on a scale (from 1 to 5), with higher values indicating greater intention to change behavior. Perceived
risk was measured on a scale (from 0 to 100), with higher values indicating a greater perceived risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Self-efficacy, response efficacy, and perceived
severity were each measured on a scale (from 1 to 5), with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of behavior change. Diabetes risk representations were measured using an
adapted Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire (from 0 to 10), with higher values indicating that the representation is more important in the participant’s construction of perceived risk.

 the possibility that provision of risk estimates that exceed participants’ perceived risk might
influence behavior, although previous trials have not reported effects among high-risk sub-
groups [18,19]. Furthermore, it is possible that information concerning the genetic risk of dis-
eases other than diabetes, such as various cancers or chronic neurodegenerative diseases,
might elicit a greater response, although this has not been the finding of published trials [47].
This trial provides much needed robust evidence on the behavioral impact of communicat-
ing genetic risk information. A systematic review identified only two clinical trials that
assessed physical activity and diet as outcomes [47]. The authors concluded that given the lim-
ited number of low quality studies, strong conclusions could not be drawn and larger, higher
quality studies were needed. The findings of this study suggest that the provision of a genetic
risk information, which reduced perceived risk in the majority of participants, did not moti-
vate healthy changes in behavior over and above phenotypic risk information or standard life-
style advice alone. Findings are consistent with those of a cohort study of the impact of direct-
to-consumer genome-wide testing [48] and recent trials of type 2 diabetes genetic risk infor-
mation [18,19] and add to existing evidence showing that those who undergo testing seldom
experience psychological harm [13,49]. While risk information appears not to motivate
changes in health behaviors, there is some evidence that it may influence decisions about use
of medication [50,51].
Previous research indicates that the effect of communicating genetic risk information on
perceived risk, a central construct in many health behavior theories, is unclear. Most studies
report that perceived risk decreases after receipt of risk information, usually towards a more
accurate perception of risk [52]. We found that the provision of a genetic risk estimate was
associated with lower and more accurate perceived risk both immediately and after eight
weeks. However, there were no differences in risk perception between those receiving genetic
information and a phenotypic risk estimate that can be calculated using routinely collected
clinical data. Small but statistically significant immediate effects of risk information on diet
response efficacy, illness understanding, and perceived severity may have arisen through mul-
tiple testing.

 The strengths of this trial include the recruitment of a relatively large sample, a randomized
design with sufficient power to assess clinically important impacts on objectively measured
behavior, and a high rate of study completion (97%). We presented risk information in a man-
ner similar to that of several direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies. Potential limita-
tions are that participants were recruited from one location in the UK, were well-educated,
physically and psychologically healthy, and exhibited limited socioeconomic and ethnic diver-
sity. Consequently, the results might not generalize to other settings or groups. Other limita-
tions include the use of a baseline measure of physical activity that occurred prior to
enrollment in the study, self-report questionnaires to measure all secondary outcomes, and a
relatively short time to follow-up. However, it is widely assumed that the continuous measure
of physical activity for three or more days accurately captures habitual physical activity levels.
To the extent that this is true and baseline differences were equally distributed across study
groups, the time between the baseline measure of physical activity and enrolment should not
have influenced the results. Furthermore, it is unlikely that communication of risk information
would have a long-term effect in the absence of an impact in the short term. We did not
attempt to assess the clinical validity and utility of the genetic or phenotypic risk estimates as
the objective of the trial was to determine the effect of the reported estimates on behavior,
regardless of the accuracy of the estimate. However, the risk estimates have been validated in
other studies. Although nearly all participants who received a risk estimate believed it to be
accurate, the extent to which they were aware of the uncertain clinical validity and utility of
predictive genetic tests may have influenced the results of the trial.
In conclusion, we found that communicating an estimate of the risk of type 2 diabetes,
either based on genotype or phenotype, did not motivate changes in behavior in the short
term, but neither did it cause an increase in worry or anxiety. These findings are consistent
with systematic review evidence and should inform the ongoing debate regarding the regula-
tory response to the proliferation of direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies. Additional
research is needed to investigate the conditions under which risk information might enhance
preventive strategies. Approaches targeting individual behavior change, such as communicat-
ing genetic risk, are unlikely to be successful in isolation in an environment in which there are
many impediments to being physically active and eating a healthy diet. The results of the cur-
rent study thus provide further evidence for a shift in focus for promoting healthy changes in
habitual, environmentally patterned behaviors, such as physical activity and diet, away from
interventions solely based on provision of information and advice to individuals towards inter-
ventions that target the wider collective determinants of disease [53].
