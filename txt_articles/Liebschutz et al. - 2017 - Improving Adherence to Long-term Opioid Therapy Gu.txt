IMPORTANCE Prescription opioid misuse is a national crisis. Few interventions have improved
adherence to opioid-prescribing guidelines.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether a multicomponent intervention, Transforming Opioid
Prescribing in Primary Care (TOPCARE; http://mytopcare.org/), improves guideline
adherence while decreasing opioid misuse risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cluster-randomized clinical trial among 53 primary care
clinicians (PCCs) and their 985 patients receiving long-term opioid therapy for pain. The study
was conducted from January 2014 to March 2016 in 4 safety-net primary care practices.
INTERVENTIONS Intervention PCCs received nurse care management, an electronic registry,
1-on-1 academic detailing, and electronic decision tools for safe opioid prescribing. Control
PCCs received electronic decision tools only.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes included documentation of
guideline-concordant care (both a patient-PCC agreement in the electronic health record and
at least 1 urine drug test [UDT]) over 12 months and 2 or more early opioid refills. Secondary
outcomes included opioid dose reduction (ie, 10% decrease in morphine-equivalent daily
dose [MEDD] at trial end) and opioid treatment discontinuation. Adjusted outcomes
controlled for differing baseline patient characteristics: substance use diagnosis, mental
health diagnoses, and language.
RESULTS Of the 985 participating patients, 519 were men, and 466 were women (mean [SD]
patient age, 54.7 [11.5] years). Patients received a mean (SD) MEDD of 57.8 (78.5) mg. At
1 year, intervention patients were more likely than controls to receive guideline-concordant
care (65.9% vs 37.8%; P < .001; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 6.0; 95% CI, 3.6-10.2), to have a
patient-PCC agreement (of the 376 without an agreement at baseline, 53.8% vs 6.0%;
P < .001; AOR, 11.9; 95% CI, 4.4-32.2), and to undergo at least 1 UDT (74.6% vs 57.9%;
P < .001; AOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.8-5.0). There was no difference in odds of early refill receipt
between groups (20.7% vs 20.1%; AOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.8). Intervention patients were more
likely than controls to have either a 10% dose reduction or opioid treatment discontinuation
(AOR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-2.1; P < .001). In adjusted analyses, intervention patients had a mean
(SE) MEDD 6.8 (1.6) mg lower than controls (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A multicomponent intervention improved
guideline-concordant care but did not decrease early opioid refills.

fessional medical societies and the Centers for Disease Control

that a systems-based approach may be more effective.20,21
In an effort to improve adherence to opioid-prescribing
guidelines in primary care, we conducted a randomized clini-
cal trial (RCT) to test a multicomponent intervention—
TOPCARE (Transforming Opioid Prescribing in Primary Care)—
combining individual components found to be potentially
effective in observational studies: nurse care management, an
electronic registry, academic detailing incorporating indi-
vidual performance reports (eg, audit and feedback), and elec-
tronic decision tools.22 We hypothesized that the interven-
tion would increase use of guideline-concordant strategies.

Question Does a multicomponent intervention with a nurse care
manager, electronic registry, data-driven academic detailing, and
electronic decision tools improve adherence to opioid-prescribing
guidelines and decrease early refills of opioids in patients with
chronic pain compared with electronic decision tools alone?
Findings The multicomponent intervention improved adherence
to guideline-recommended monitoring but did not decrease early
opioid refills.
Meaning Whilethemulticomponentinterventionimprovedadherence
to guideline-recommended monitoring of opioids in patients with
chronic pain, further research is needed to determine whether
guideline adherence reduces opioid-related risks.

 oid refills had changed. Patients in the control group did not
experience changes in their care team or workflow.
Intervention and Control Conditions
The development and rationale of the intervention is detailed
elsewhere,22 andthetrialprotocolisprovidedinSupplement1.
Here, we summarize the 4 intervention components.
The first component of intervention is the nurse care man-
ager, a registered or licensed practical nurse who performs ini-
tial and ongoing patient assessments for pain, addiction, and
opioid misuse risk; prepares prescriptions for the PCC to sign
or reminds the PCC to print prescriptions; collects UDTs; con-
ducts pill counts (ie, counts pills between refills to monitor
medication use); checks PDMPs on behalf of PCCs; and as-
sesses for concerning patient issues (eg, unexpected UDT re-
sults) and collaborates with the PCC to develop appropriate
clinical responses to these issues.
The second intervention component is a web-based elec-
tronic registry to facilitate population management by import-
ingdatafromtheEHR(eg,refilldates,UDTresults)andproduc-
ing reports used to direct work flow (eg, lists of patients with
opioid prescriptions due on a certain day or week) and to sup-
portacademicdetailing(eg,providefeedbackonPCCpanelchar-
acteristics such as percentage of patients with an agreement).
The third intervention component is a single 1-on-1 aca-
demic detailing session25 between an opioid-prescribing ex-
pert (J.M.L., M.L. or D.P.A.) and the PCC. The participants in
these sessions discuss principles of safe opioid prescribing and
monitoring, registry reports, details on patient monitoring and
risk level, and challenging patient cases.
Finally, all participating PCCs, both intervention and con-
trol, undergo orientation about and are given access to elec-
tronic decision tools through an online platform (http:
//mytopcare.org/) that includes evidence-based tools for
assessment of patient opioid misuse risk (eg, the Opioid Risk
Tool26) and interactive tools to assist with UDT ordering
and interpretation. Control PCCs receive only this fourth
component(ie,orientationandaccesstotheelectronicdecision
tools). See eAppendix B in Supplement 2 for more details.
Outcomes and Data Collection
Patient-Level Outcomes
Primaryoutcomeswereobservedovera12-monthperiodandin-
cluded(1)PCCadherencetoopioidtherapymonitoringstrategies
and(2)earlyrefills.Primarycareclinicianadherencetoguidelines
was defined as presence of a patient-clinician agreement and at
least1completedUDTforcontrolledandillicitsubstances.Early
refillsweredefinedas2ormoreearlyrefills,consistentwithprior
studies.27,28 An early refill was considered to be a similar opioid
prescription (ie, same dose and directions) given more than 3
days prior to the next expected refill date.22 eAppendix A in
Supplement 2 provides details on early refill calculation.
Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients
for whom treatment with opioids was discontinued and the
proportion of patients who had a 10% reduction in opioid dose
as measured in MEDD among nondiscontinued patients.
eAppendix A in Supplement 2 provides details on discontinu-
ation and MEDD calculation.

Statistical Analysis
All outcomes were analyzed according to the intent-to-treat
principle.31 We verified that demographic characteristics of the
intervention and control patients were similar at baseline
(Table 1). We compared the baseline and 12-month follow-up
measures for each of the primary outcomes of the interven-
tion vs control patients, stratified by intervention status, using
2-sided statistical significance at the P = .05 level. To analyze
odds of receipt of agreement, we analyzed data only for pa-
tients without existing agreements because the outcome was
measured as agreement ever in the EHR, and those with prior
agreements would not be eligible for a new one. To control for
potential confounders identified in bivariate analyses, we con-
ducted a regression analysis of the 12-month follow-up out-
comes, adjusting for baseline measures that differed be-
tween groups. We used a regression model with a logit link

 function for binary outcomes, and an identity link function for
continuous outcomes. We used robust standard error esti-
mates (generalized estimating equations method), adjusting
for clustering of patients among PCCs. We used quasi-
likelihood under the independence model criteria for gener-
alized estimating equations model fit criteria. We reported ad-
justed odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals for
binary outcomes, and beta coefficients for continuous out-
comes.Inaddition,weusedCoxregressiontoevaluatethetime
to discontinuation of opioid treatment among patients, re-
porting hazard ratios of the relative risk of treatment discon-
tinuation by intervention status. We evaluated proportional
hazard assumption of the Cox model. No covariates in
adjusted models were time-dependent variables.
Results
A total of 53 PCCs were enrolled in the study; 28 were random-
ized to the control group and 25 to the intervention condi-
tion. Twenty-eight percent of PCCs were aged 25 to 35 years
(n = 16); 30% were aged 36 to 45 years (n = 16); 12% aged 46
to 50 years (n = 6); and 34% 51 years or older (n = 15). Two-
thirds were female (n = 35), 66% white (n = 35), 9% African
American/black (n = 5), 19% Asian (n = 10), and 6% other
(n = 3). Ninety-one percent were physicians (n = 48), and 30%
were certified to prescribe buprenorphine (n = 16). Interven-
tion PCCs cared for a mean of 23 patients (median, 13; range,
1-92) with long-term opioid therapy, while control PCCs cared
for a mean of 15 patients (median, 11; range 0-70) (P = .09). Re-
garding ranges below the prespecified minimum of 4 or more
patients for enrollment, some of the originally eligible PCCs
dropped below the threshold between the time we calculated
eligibility via EHR algorithm and the time we enrolled them
into the study (generally 4- to 6-week difference). We did not
exclude anyone from the study on this basis because we con-
ducted intent-to-treat analyses. There were no differences be-
tween the groups with respect to demographic or practice
characteristics.22 At baseline, clinicians displayed no differ-
ence in their patient proportions of signed agreements, early
refills, UDTs, or mean MEDD (Table 2).

concordant opioid monitoring with patient-clinician agree-

in 4 urban safety-net primary care practices. The interven-

though not a primary study outcome, opioid dose reduction
and opioid treatment discontinuation were both increased in
the intervention group compared with the control group.

baseline levels of outcome measures (UDT, agreement, early refills).
bP values for the test of difference of the differences between groups were
identical.
c Early refill is defined as a prescription of the same opioid dose and directions
given more than 3 days prior to the next expected fill date. This measure
excludes potential prescription reprints (multiple prescriptions printed within
7 days).

 Althoughnumerouseffortshavetargetedopioid-prescribing

be studied in a randomized clinical trial. Other health system
innovations have shown improved guideline adherence when
researchers have analyzed observational data using a pre-post
design or comparison of different settings.21,32 Von Korff et al33

so dose reduction and discontinuation were included as sec-

possible.4 We posit that closer scrutiny of patient function and
risks may have contributed to these findings.
Limitations
UsingtheEHRasasolesourceofpatientdataisalimitation.For
example, the EHR did not capture the patient experience of the

limitations include inability to measure unintended conse-
quences. It is unclear whether opioid dose reduction or discon-
tinuation was due to more judicious or more fearful opioid pre-
scribing.Fearfulprescribingmaydeprivepatientsofindicatedpain

scribingpatients’barrierstoobtainingpainmedicationswithin-

and discontinuation may produce a rupture in the patient-PCC
relationship and not necessarily a decrease in risk. Finally, the

s generalizability to non–safety-net settings is unknown.
Conclusions
TOPCARE, a multicomponent primary care–based interven-
tion, was successful in increasing PCC adherence to guide-
lines for monitoring patients treated with long-term opioid
therapy for chronic pain but not at decreasing early opioid
refills by these patients.

Editor's Note
Going Beyond Guideline-Concordant Opioid Therapy
to Improve Patient Safety
Scott R. Bauer, MD; Mitchell H. Katz, MD
More than 25 000 Americans died of a prescription opioid
overdose in 2015.1 Over the
prior decade, rates of opioid-
related emergency depart-
ment visits and hospitaliza-
tionsnearlydoubled.2Interventionstodecreaseopioiduseand
its associated harms, while still providing pain relief to alle-
viate suffering, are desperately needed.
TheeditorswerepleasedtoseethisstudybyLiebschutzand
colleagues3 because the investigators used a rigorous study de-
sign to assess the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention to
decreasetheharmsofopioidtherapyinpatientstreatedatasafety-
net hospital or community health center. The intervention suc-
cessfully increased guideline-concordant care. Patients whose
primarycarephysicianwasrandomizedtohavenursingcareman-
agementavailableintheoffice,anelectronicchronicopioidreg-
istry, and individualized prescription feedback were approxi-
mately3timesmorelikelytohaveapatient-clinicianagreement
and regular urine toxicology testing compared with patients
whosephysicianreceivedonlyelectronicdecisiontools.Unfor-
tunately,theinterventionwaslesssuccessfulinimproving“hard”
outcomes,andnopainoutcomeswerecollected.Patientsofphy-
sicians in the intervention group were prescribed slightly lower
opioid doses on average, but there was no change in the rates of
opioid discontinuation during the 12-month follow-up period.
Reversing the growth in opioid use for chronic pain is dif-
ficult because of the paucity of effective alternative treat-
ments. In the meantime, this study demonstrates that it is pos-
sible to increase safe prescribing habits among primary care
physicians. We are encouraged by the increasing evidence of
benefit of many nonnarcotic and nonpharmacologic ap-
proaches to chronic pain, such as mindfulness training4 or cog-
