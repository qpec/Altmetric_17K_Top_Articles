Postmenopausal hormone therapy and
Alzheimer disease
A prospective cohort study
ABSTRACT
Objective: To explore the association between postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) and Alz-
heimer disease (AD).
Methods: Twenty-year follow-up data from the Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention
study cohort were used. Self-administered questionnaires were sent to all women aged 47–56
years, residing in Kuopio Province starting in 1989 until 2009, every 5th year. Register-based
information on HT prescriptions was available since 1995. Probable AD cases, based on DSM-IV
and National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke–Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria, were identified from the special reim-
bursement register (1999–2009). The study population included 8,195 women (227 cases of
incident AD).
Results: Postmenopausal estrogen use was not associated with AD risk in register-based or self-
reported data (hazard ratio/95% confidence interval 0.92/0.68–1.2, 0.99/0.75–1.3, respec-
tively). Long-term self-reported postmenopausal HT was associated with reduced AD risk
(0.53/0.31–0.91). Similar results were obtained with any dementia diagnosis in the hospital
discharge register as an outcome.
Conclusions: Our results do not provide strong evidence for a protective association between
postmenopausal HT use and AD or dementia, although we observed a reduced AD risk among
those with long-term self-reported HT use. Neurology® 2017;88:1062–1068

Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, accounts for 60%–80% of cases.1
Women have AD more often than men either due to their increased life expectancy2,3 or decline
in sex steroid hormone levels around menopause,1,4 although some small studies have not
detected this sex difference.5,6 Neuroprotective effects of estrogen have been observed in exper-
imental animals,7–10 but clinical trials on postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) use have not
been successful,11–13 including the largest clinical trial to date, the Women’s Health Initiative
Memory Study (WHIMS).14 Observational studies support use of HT against AD if initiated
around menopause in some15,16 but not all studies.17–20 Similarly, register-based studies have
yielded conflicting results.18,20,21 Results from the Leisure World cohort revealed that the
reduced risk of AD among HT users was a function of dose and duration.22,23

 The aim of our study is to investigate the
association
of
self-reported
and
register-
recorded postmenopausal HT use with AD
in a longitudinal prospective cohort, while tak-
ing into account various socioeconomic and
lifestyle-related AD risk factors.
METHODS Study population. The present study is based on
the 20-year follow-up of the population of the Kuopio
Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention study cohort. A self-
administered baseline postal questionnaire was sent to all
women aged 47–56 years who were residents of Kuopio
Province, Eastern Finland (n 5 14,220), in February 1989. A
total of 13,100 (92.1%) women responded. The reasons for
nonresponse were lack of address or residence not detected (n 5
119) and death (n 5 4). In addition, 947 women did not respond
for other reasons and 50 returned a blank form. The 5-year follow-
up in 1994, 10-year follow-up in 1999, 15-year follow-up in
2004, and 20-year follow-up in 2009 was mailed to the 13,100,
12,562, 12,075, and 11,420 women, respectively. A total of
11,954 (91.2%), 11,538 (91.8%), 10,926 (90.4%), and 8,195
(71.8%) women responded to the 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year follow-
ups, respectively. The questionnaires were sent to women who had
responded to the baseline inquiry, were alive, and had a valid
postal address at that time.
The baseline questionnaire covered demographics, lifestyle,
medical issues, and other characteristics such as age, height,
weight, smoking, alcohol consumption, health disorders diag-
nosed by a physician, reproductive history, type and duration
of HT use, operations, occupation, and physical activity. These
questionnaires were repeated in the follow-up inquiries.
The present study included those 8,195 women who had
complete data on confounders and self-reported exposure. Out-
come data and register-based exposure data were available for
all participants.
Outcomes. The main outcome of our study was clinically veri-
fied AD diagnosis. These diagnoses from 1999–2009 were iden-
tified from the Finnish special reimbursement register maintained
by the Social Insurance Institution (SII). The register contains
information on the reimbursed drugs used for chronic illnesses
such as AD. The Finnish special reimbursement register possesses
high validity and positive predictive value for AD diagnosis.24 The
Finnish Current Care Guideline recommends that all persons
with AD are treated with antidementia drugs unless there is
a specific contraindication (such as gastric ulcer/intestinal tract
operation ,6 months ago or severe asthma or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors).25 In
Finland, the diagnosis of probable AD is based on DSM-IV
criteria for AD and National Institute of Neurologic and
Communicative Disorders and Stroke–Alzheimer Disease and
Related Disorders Association.26,27 The main diagnostic criteria
were progressive decline in memory and cognition and exclusion
of other reasons. Diagnosis of AD was supported by abnormal
MRI or CSF biomarker findings typical for AD.
To be eligible for reimbursed AD medication (acetylcholines-
terase inhibitors or memantine), a medical statement of a clinically
verified AD diagnosis needs to be submitted to SII. Thus, case
identification is carried out in clinics but is reconfirmed by SII.
Summary of anamnestic information from the patients and
family, as well as findings, e.g., MRI/CT, laboratory tests,
and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease,
are submitted to the SII, where a geriatrician/neurologist
systematically evaluates the diagnostic evidence for each AD case
and confirms whether the prespecified criteria are met excluding
possible alternative diagnoses for memory impairment such as
severe depression, metabolic disturbances, and other forms of
dementia such as vascular dementia without AD-like symptoms.
We also performed sensitivity analyses with dementia as an
outcome. These data were extracted from the National Hospital
Discharge register using the following ICD-10 codes: F00–F03
(F00, dementia in Alzheimer disease; F01, vascular dementia;
F02, dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere; F03, unspec-
ified dementia) and G30 (Alzheimer disease, early/late onset).
This register includes all inpatient admissions. Diagnosis codes
for each admission are recorded by attending physician. All
Finnish citizens/long-term residents are covered by tax-supported
public health service.
Use of HT. Self-reported HT use was recorded as lifetime use in
years (and indication of use) at the baseline inquiry in 1989. In all
follow-up questionnaires, numbers of months per year of estrogen
use were reported and the duration of self-reported estrogen use
was calculated on basis of these questionnaires. Current
medication prescribed by a physician, duration and purpose of
use, and name of tablets used were asked in all inquiries. To
exclude the possibility of recall bias in the self-reported
questionnaires, we accessed the prescription register data to
ascertain HT use. Vaginal products were excluded. HT was
defined from the registry as those preparations having systemic
estrogenic properties belonging to the following codes of ATC
classification:
G03C
(estrogens),
G03F
(estrogen
and
progesterone) excluding oral contraceptives. Self-reported use of
estrogen was categorized into postmenopausal HT based on use
after the onset of menopause.
Covariates. Baseline menopause status was categorized to 5
categories: (1) menstruating, no HT; (2) true menopause; (3)
menstruating, HT 1–30 years; (4) hysterectomy and HT, no
oophorectomy; (5) unclear (hysterectomy, no data on oophorec-
tomy or HT use). When categorizing the self-reported HT to
postmenopausal use, a woman was considered postmenopausal if
$12 months had passed since her natural menstrual cycle, if she
had
undergone
surgical
menopause
through
bilateral
oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy, or if the time
since menopause and the history of HT use could be clarified
from the follow-up questionnaire. For the present study, we used
data on natural menopause (i.e., date of last menstruation,
collected through self-reports at baseline and 5-year follow-up
assessments). Over 90% of women were postmenopausal at the
second follow-up. Missing information was collected from
participants by
telephone. Body
mass index
(BMI) was
calculated as the ratio of weight in kilograms to height in
meters squared and was based on self-reporting.
Physical activity was inquired through self-reported data in 3
ways at baseline and in all follow-up surveys as follows: leisure
time physical activity as well as asking about how physically
demanding work was in the last year; ambulatory status as capa-
bility and extent of movement, need of aids in movement, and
history of joint degeneration; and amount of physical activity,
including winter and summer activities, amount of current regu-
lar physical activity, and its duration (hours per week). Of these 3
categories, the amount of physical activity was the most predictive
of AD and thus was included in the analyses.
Data on education were obtained in self-reported data only
from a subcohort undergoing bone marrow density measure-
ment. Education was categorized into 4 groups: compulsory
schooling, compulsory schooling 1 maximum 2 years of
Neurology 88

1063
 supplementary school or occupational training, high school 1
minimum 2 years of supplementary school or professional
training, and university degree. To assess whether the adjustment
for education affected the results, we conducted a separate sensi-
tivity analyses in the subcohort for whom we had education data
(n 5 2,383). History of ever/never smoking was asked in all self-
reported questionnaires along with regularity of smoking, num-
ber of years of smoking, and number of cigarettes smoked per
day.
Data on self-reported occupation were gathered under 9 dif-
ferent categories (managers; professionals; technicians and associ-
ate professionals; clerical support workers; service and sales
workers; skilled agricultural, fish, and forestry; crafts and related
trades workers; plant and machine operators; other occupation;
and housewife/pensioner/caregiver/no occupation) but converted
into a dichotomous variable (employed and unemployed) for the
analyses. Alcohol consumption was inquired in questionnaires as
the amount of alcohol beverages consumed during a 1-month
period and converted into grams of alcohol intake per month.
At baseline, women were asked in questionnaire about the age
at menarche, age at menopause, number of pregnancies, number
of live births, and abortions. Abortion was inquired in question-
naire as “Number of times interrupting pregnancies due to
abortion/miscarriage.” A history of any gynecologic operations
(caesarian sections and sterilizations) was also obtained, as well
as what, if anything, was removed in these operations (uterus,
ovary, part of both, cervix, or other parts of genitals).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The study design was approved by the Ethics Com-
mittee of Kuopio University Hospital and written informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out with Sta-
ta 12.0 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX). The characteristics
of women with respect to AD incidence were compared using x2
test for categorical variables and t test for continuous variables.
Correlation between confounders and exposure were investigated
with
the
Spearman
correlation
coefficient.
As
expected,
hysterectomy and oophorectomy were strongly correlated (r 5
0.561) and were thus combined into one variable (surgery). There
were no other indications of collinearity (r , 0.4).
Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the
association between HT use and AD incidence. Separate analyses
were carried out for different durations of use and different types
of HT. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were esti-
mated with age-adjusted model and model adjusted for age,
BMI, alcohol, smoking, physical activity, occupation status,
number of births, menopause status, any cancer, and surgery.
Since the education data were available for only a subset of partic-
ipants, sensitivity analyses were conducted in this group sepa-
rately. Association between HT and dementia was studied
similarly.
We studied whether the association between HT and AD was
different among women who had undergone oophorectomy or
hysterectomy by assessing the interaction of hysterectomy or
oophorectomy and self-reported and register-recorded HT use.
There was no evidence for effect modification by these surgeries
(All p values for interaction were .0.6) and thus stratified anal-
yses were not performed.
RESULTS Average age at AD diagnosis was 72.3
years (range 59.2–78.6 years). Women who later
developed AD were significantly older than women
without AD. They also reported less physical activity
and were more likely to be unemployed than
women who were not diagnosed with AD during
the follow-up. Number of childbirths, abortions,
and pregnancies was similar between groups, but
women who developed AD were more likely to be
menopausal at baseline than those who were not
diagnosed
with
AD.
Register-reported
HT
or
oophorectomy/hysterectomy
was
not
associated
with AD in these univariable analyses (table e-1 at
Neurology.org).

 Table 1 shows the relative risk of AD according to
both register-based and self-reported HT use (yes/
no). Neither register-based nor self-reported HT use
was associated with AD risk. The results were similar
in the sensitivity analyses conducted among those
with data on education (n 5 2,383; tables e-2 and
e-3), i.e., no association was detected between HT use
(any HT, estrogen, or combination therapy; either
register-based or self-reported) and AD.
HT use when categorized according to duration
register-based HT use was not associated with AD
(table 2). However, when self-reported data were
used, those with longest self-reported HT use .10
years had lower risk of AD in comparison to nonusers
(table 3) also after adjusting for lifestyle and socioeco-
nomic confounders and variables related to estrogen
status. Sensitivity analyses with any dementia as an
outcome produced similar results to those shown in
tables 1–3, although the association between .10
years HT use and AD was attenuated and its confi-
dence also included 1 in the sensitivity analyses (ta-
bles e-4 to e-6).
DISCUSSION The findings from our large prospec-
tive cohort study do not provide strong evidence for
an association between postmenopausal HT use and

 AD or dementia, although a protective association
between long-term (.10 years) self-reported use of
HT and AD was observed. This finding indirectly
favors the effectiveness of HT if started in the early
postmenopausal period (critical window theory).
Another explanation for this association can be
reverse causation, i.e., AD (or more precisely, its
preclinical symptoms) affecting the exposure to HT
(or reporting of HT duration in the self-reported
data), or a chance finding. The association with
longer duration of HT use was only found in self-
reported postmenopausal estrogen use, not for
register-based
HT
use
after
1995,
and
the
association was less evident when all dementia
diagnoses instead of clinically verified AD diagnosis
were used as an outcome. One explanation for the
different results with self-reported and register-based
exposure could be different time period as register
data were not available before 1995, which is 7
years after the baseline inquiry. Thus, the register-
based data after 1995 would misclassify those who
discontinued HT use before 1995 as nonusers. It is
unlikely that this misclassification was differential in
those who later developed AD and those who did not.
Therefore it would lead to an underestimation of the
association between HT use and AD with the
register-based
data
after
1995.
An
alternative
explanation is recall bias, but this is unlikely as
previous validation study from the same cohort
showed that a postal inquiry is a reliable method
of
recording
long-term
HT
use
in
Finnish
postmenopausal women.28
Our result is in line with the extended follow-up
of the Cache County Study, which detected a reduced
AD risk if HT was started within 5 years of meno-
pause and continued for more than 10 years.15 The
largest clinical trial on HT–all cause dementia associ-
ation, i.e., WHIMS, assessed cognitive performance
of women .65 years old, assigned to conjugated
equine estrogen (CEE; unopposed therapy) vs pla-
cebo or continuous CEE 1 medroxyprogesterone
acetate (CEE 1 MPA; opposed therapy) vs placebo.
The use of opposed HT increased the dementia risk,
but this did not occur with unopposed HT.14,29 In the
WHIMS trial, women were randomized to receive
opposed therapy as CEE combined with MPA. In
Finland, estradiol in combination with norethisterone
or levonorgestrel (not MPA) is used among women
with intact uterus30 and only estradiol is used mainly
among women undergoing hysterectomy.31 The dif-
ference between these 2 studies may be attributable to
the differences in the effects exerted by the different
estrogen preparations. In addition, the women in our
cohort were around 10 years younger than women in
the WHI trial, and the main outcome in our study
was AD, while it was all-cause dementia in WHIMS.
One cohort study reported that an early initiation
of HT around menopause was protective against
AD.32 Similar findings were reported from the
Multi-Institutional Research in Alzheimer Genetic
Epidemiology study, where HT use in the youngest
age tertiles (50–63 years) protected against AD in
comparison to those in the older age tertiles.33
The lack of association in our cohort between any
HT use (all users of HT, not taking into account
either the time of initiation or the duration of ther-
apy) and AD/dementia is consistent with previous
observational studies where HT was categorized as
former or current use and lifetime estrogen exposure
was taken into account.34,35 Postmenopausal estrogen
therapy was not protective against AD in 2 of the
case-control studies.18,20 This discrepancy in observa-
tional studies is explained by differences in outcome
measurement, number of observations, duration,
type, and the time of initiation of HT use.
The strengths of our study include its large sample
size, long follow-up time, relatively homogenous pop-
ulation, clinically verified AD cases, prescription-
based validation of HT use, and control for various
important comorbidities. Confounders and exposures
were measured with the same questions during the
follow-up. In addition, the positive predictive value
of AD diagnosis in the Special Reimbursement Regis-
ter is high.24 However, it is likely that this register
does not capture all AD cases, or persons with other
forms of dementia. Therefore we conducted sensitiv-
ity analysis with any dementia as an outcome. Despite
these strengths, our study has some limitations: first,
information was collected by self-reported postal
inquiries, which may be subject to recall bias; second,
the effect of healthy user bias among the long-term
users cannot be overlooked; third, register data on
HT use and AD diagnosis were available from 1995
to 1999 onwards, respectively; fourth, we cannot
eliminate the chance of a survival bias contributing
to the protective association observed among the lon-
gest HT users; fifth, we were not able to control the
results for genetic predisposition to AD (APOE status
and familial AD). However, it is unlikely that these
genetic factors would influence start of HT use and
thus it is unlikely that the results are confounded by
genetic background.
Misclassification of outcome (i.e., undiagnosed
AD or dementia cases) is possible and this would
dilute our estimates towards the null. However, the
proportion of misclassified persons is likely to be
small. Due to our outcome data source in sensitivity
analyses for dementia, we captured only those persons
with dementia who required inpatient admission (due
to dementia or other disease/accident). The diagnos-
tic process for dementia often begins in an outpatient
setting, but these settings were not included in the
1066
Neurology 88
March 14, 2017
 hospital discharge register. Therefore, those persons
with dementia who did not have any hospital admis-
sions or antidementia medications were misclassified.
Our study examined a homogenous population
(residents of Kuopio Province, all accessed via the
national social security system), thus decreasing the
chances
of
selection
bias
or
confounding
by
socioeconomic-related factors. Some previous obser-
vational studies carried out in sociodemographic
homogenous populations have observed decreased
risk of AD among HT users.23,36,37 Estrogen replace-
ment therapy was protective against AD in these
studies23,37 and sociodemographic heterogeneity may
account for the contrasting results obtained in the 2
observational studies.18,20
Our results based on 2 decades of follow-up of
a large homogenous population did not provide
strong evidence for a protective association between
postmenopausal HT use and AD or dementia.
