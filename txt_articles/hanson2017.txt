Vaccine exposure to temperatures below recommended ranges in the cold chain may decrease vaccine
potency of freeze-sensitive vaccines leading to a loss of vaccine investments and potentially places chil-
dren at risk of contracting vaccine preventable illnesses.
This literature review is an update to one previously published in 2007 (Matthias et al., 2007), analyz-
ing the prevalence of vaccine exposure to temperatures below recommendations throughout various seg-
ments of the cold chain. Overall, 45 studies included in this review assess temperature monitoring, of
which 29 specifically assess ‘too cold’ temperatures. The storage segments alone were evaluated in 41
articles, 15 articles examined the transport segment and 4 studied outreach sessions. The sample size
of the studies varied, ranging from one to 103 shipments and from three to 440 storage units. Among
reviewed articles, the percentage of vaccine exposure to temperatures below recommended ranges dur-
ing storage was 33% in wealthier countries and 37.1% in lower income countries. Vaccine exposure to
temperatures below recommended ranges occurred during shipments in 38% of studies from higher
income countries and 19.3% in lower income countries.
This review highlights continuing issues of vaccine exposure to temperatures below recommended
ranges during various segments of the cold chain. Studies monitoring the number of events vaccines
are exposed to ‘too cold’ temperatures as well as the duration of these events are needed. Many reviewed
studies emphasize the lack of knowledge of health workers regarding freeze damage of vaccines and how
this has an effect on temperature monitoring. It is important to address this issue by educating vaccina-
tors and cold chain staff to improve temperature maintenance and supply chain management, which will
facilitate the distribution of potent vaccines to children.

 1. Introduction
Immunizations are hailed as one of the most important public
health interventions known saving millions of lives every year.
Vaccines are responsible for the eradication of smallpox and the
global community is currently working towards the eradication
of polio. To reach current disease elimination and eradication tar-
gets, high immunization coverage rates are required. A well-
functioning cold chain is at the center of ensuring potent vaccines
reach their intended population in an equitable and timely manner
[2,3].
Vaccines are biological products that slowly become inactive
over time and must be kept within narrow temperature ranges
from manufacturers to those receiving them [3]. When exposed
to temperatures outside of this narrow range, the loss of potency
may be accelerated [4]. Before 2007, attention had been focused
on examining the effects of vaccine exposure to heat. However,
exposure to freezing temperatures are equally damaging to the
quality of many vaccines as the process renders them inactive
[4]. When exposed to freezing temperatures, the adjuvants con-
tained in some vaccines clump together adversely affecting the
immunological properties of these vaccines [4]. Thus, the World
Health Organization (WHO) recommends the following vaccines
be stored and transported at 0–10 �C: Diptheria-tetanus contain-
ing vaccines, tetanus toxoid (TT), hepatitis A and B, human papil-
lomavirus (HPV), meningitis C, pneumococcal (PCV), cholera,
influenza, haemophilus influenza b (Hib), typhoid and inacti-
vated poliovirus (IPV) [4]. In 2015, approximately 59% of vacci-
nes
procured
from
the
United
Nations
Children’s
Fund
(UNICEF) Supply Division’s (SD) catalogue are freeze-sensitive
[5]. Furthermore, the number of freeze-sensitive vaccines recom-
mended by the WHO has increased by 50% over the last ten
years [4,6].
In 2007, a review of studies examining temperatures in the vac-
cine cold chain from 1985 to 2006 reported that in all segments of
distribution, vaccines in 75–100% of monitored vaccine shipments
had been exposed to freezing temperatures [1]. This 2007 review
seems to have raised awareness about the risks of vaccine expo-
sure to freezing temperatures in both developed and developing
countries of varying climates.
The objective of this updated review is to examine the results of
more recent monitoring studies regarding freezing temperatures
within the immunization supply chain.
2. Methods
2.1. Identification of temperature monitoring studies
For this review, seven search terms were used alone and in
combination to search gray and peer reviewed literature in
PubMed, Popline, Embase, Biosis, and Google Scholar. In addition,
the WHO and TechNet21 websites were searched for gray litera-
ture. The search terms were (i) vaccine, (ii) temperature, (iii) ther-
mostability, (iv) storage, (v) transport, (vi) freeze, and/or (vii) cold
chain. All searches were limited to studies published between July
2006 to August 2015, and did not include studies from Matthias
et al. [1]. In addition, unpublished studies that evaluated the tem-
perature of the storage of vaccines either in facilities, during trans-
portation or at outreach sessions in any country were included in
this review.
2.2. Data extraction
The following information was extracted from each of the stud-
ies that met the inclusion criteria:
1. Year the study was published.
2. Year the study was conducted.
3. The country in which the study was conducted.
4. Type of temperature measuring equipment used.
5. Freeze threshold temperature or the temperature that was
considered ‘‘too cold”.
6. Duration vaccines were at or below the freeze threshold (the
time threshold after which was considered as ‘‘too cold”).
7. The duration of temperature monitoring.
8. The frequency of temperature monitoring.
9. Unit of analysis (refrigerators, transport in vaccine carriers,
transport in refrigerated trucks, etc.).
10. Study sample size (number of refrigerators or shipments).
11. Number of samples that registered freezing temperatures.
12. Percentage of samples that registered freezing temperatures
or temperatures out of the recommended range of 2–8 �C.
13. Minimum temperatures observed.
2.3. Analysis
Data were analyzed from studies that reported temperature
monitoring results. Different segments of the cold chain were ana-
lyzed separately to account for differences in endpoints across
studies. Analysis of data from published studies includes means
and standard deviations (SD) of study sample sizes and years of
studies as well as the weighted means and SDs of the percent of
samples found below recommended temperatures. Some studies
provide temperature data for more than one administrative level
and for more than one cold chain segment; therefore, an individual
study may have multiple data points. In addition, each country was
categorized by region and World Bank income status [7]. Wealthier
countries are defined as those with upper-middle to high income
status and lower income countries are defined as those in low to
lower-middle income status.
Rigorous monitoring was defined as studies in which both the
frequency and duration of exposure to temperatures below recom-
mended temperatures were reported. For duration of monitoring,
anything more than 1 week was assigned a 1 and less was assigned
a 0. For frequency of monitoring, any study with continuous mon-
itoring was given a 1, while spot checks or one time point only
measurements were given a 0. Rigor was calculated by then multi-
plying the two to determine a single indication (0 or 1). Rigorous
studies were identified by a 1.
Data was entered, stored and tabulated in ExcelTM (Microsoft,
Redmond, WA).
3. Results
The literature and web search was completed on March 21,
2016 and yielded 1070 articles. Screening of these articles led to
the removal of 889 citations based on relevance of abstracts and
titles. The remaining 181 full text citations were screened accord-
ing to the study inclusion criteria. The secondary and final screen
yielded 45 articles for final inclusion in the review (Tables 1 and 2).
Of the 45 articles, 33 are from peer-reviewed journals and 12
are from gray or unpublished literature. Thirteen articles describe
temperature monitoring data from the African region, 12 from
the Western Pacific region, nine from the South East Asian region,
three from the Americas, four from the Eastern Mediterranean and
four from Europe.
Studies from all income levels are represented. Seven studies
are from high-income countries (HIC), 13 are from upper-middle
income countries (UMIC), 15 are from lower-middle income coun-
tries (LMIC) and eight are from low-income countries (LIC). Two

 articles describe data from more than one country and these coun-
tries represent various income levels.
Studies defined the threshold for low, cold or freezing temper-
atures at or below 2 �C in 37 studies; however, three studies
defined the threshold at or below 0 �C and five studies did not
specifically mention a low threshold. The lowest temperature
reported was �21.3 �C and the highest reported was 31.7 �C. Com-
plete temperature ranges were not available in 31 studies. Eigh-
teen studies evaluated storage units or shipments that fell out of
the recommended range of 2–8 �C, however, they did not specify
exact temperatures or whether freezing occurred.
Assessment of the cold chain at a national level was performed
in seven studies, the provincial or regional level in 20 studies and
the district level in 35 studies. One study did not specify an admin-
istrative level.
All cold chain segments were represented in the final 45 arti-
cles. The storage segments alone were evaluated in 29 articles
and four articles only examined the transport segment. Eight arti-
cles studied storage and transport segments; three studies exam-
ined storage, transport and outreach sessions and one article
studied storage and outreach sessions.
The sample size of the studies varied, ranging from one to 103
shipments or from three to 440 storage units. Storage units were
described as walk-in-coolers, domestic refrigerators, ice-lined
refrigerators, kerosene electric refrigerators, purpose built refriger-
ators, bar-type refrigerators, cold boxes, vaccine carriers and study
boxes. The transport segments and outreach sessions utilized vac-
cine carriers or cold boxes.
Further analysis concentrating on data from studies that
assessed vaccine exposure to temperatures below recommended
ranges included 21 articles (Table 1). Twenty-four studies were
excluded based on a lack of information. This analysis found that
the percent of shipments found below recommended temperatures
in wealthier countries was 38% and 19.3% in lower income coun-
tries. The percent of storage units where vaccines were exposed
to temperatures below recommended ranges were 33.3% in
wealthier countries and 37.1% in lower income countries. Three
temperature monitoring studies during outreach sessions were
found in lower income countries and none were found from
wealthier countries. The percent of vaccine exposure to tempera-
tures below recommended ranges during outreach sessions was
18% (Table 3).
Recommendations were included in all studies and the most
commonly cited recommendation for countries are to conduct
training sessions (19 articles), to improve supervision (10 articles)
and the need for policies and guidelines (5 articles).
4. Discussion
Matthias et al. [1] identified 35 articles published between 1985
and June 2006 that assessed vaccine exposure to ’too cold’ temper-
atures, which equates to an average of 1.7 articles per year. This
update identified 21 articles in the last 10 years with data assess-
ing vaccine exposure to temperatures below the recommended
range in vaccine cold chains, which is a rate of 2.1 articles on aver-
age per year. This may indicate a slight increase in awareness of
vaccine exposure to freezing temperatures. Over the last ten years,
improvements in cold chain monitoring have been reported due to
newer cold chain technology and more studies are implementing
rigorous temperature monitoring techniques, as defined in this
article, than were reported in 2007 [1]. In Vietnam, continuous
temperature monitoring systems showed that vaccines in vaccine
carriers monitored during the study were not exposed to temper-
atures below 0 �C and enabled the country to identify temperature
excursions during storage and outreach sessions [8]. Similarly,
exposure to temperatures below recommended ranges during
transport decreased by 12.1 percentage points and freeze alarms
were reduced by 40% in Tunisia due to the use of continuous tem-
perature monitoring and Phase Change Material (PCM) transport
packs [9]. India reported significant improvements in the mainte-
nance of cold chain temperatures after reorganizing the cold chain
and training health workers [10].
The same analysis completed by Matthias et al. [1] (Table 3)
was also completed in this updated review. Since 2007, a greater
number of articles from low to lower-middle income countries
have completed studies examining the transport and outreach seg-
ments of the cold chain.
The occurrence of temperatures below the ‘too cold’ threshold
in studies that monitored temperatures during transport showed
that shipments in lower income countries was 35.3% in the set of

 studies presented by Matthias et al. (19.3% in the set analyzed
here) [1]. Shipments exposed to ‘too cold’ temperatures in wealth-
ier countries were 16.7% in the 2007 paper (38% here). However,
the percent of rigorous studies, as defined here, conducted during
transport was 50% for wealthier countries in 2007 (50% here) and
78% for lower income countries (50% here Table 3).
In studies that monitored temperatures during vaccine storage,
the occurrence of exposure to temperatures considered ‘too cold’ in
wealthier countries was 29% in 2007 (33.3% here), and 21.9% in
lower income countries in 2007 (37.1% here). The percentage of
storage monitoring studies with rigorous methods, in lower
income countries was 50% in 2007 (50% here). For wealthier coun-
tries, rigorous methods were found in 29% of storage monitoring
studies in 2007 (70% here Table 3).
A possible reason for the differences in findings between the
two papers is the percentage of studies with rigorous methods.
This is important since Matthias et al. found that rigorous studies
were a significant predictor of exposure to temperatures below
recommended ranges. Since rigor, as defined here, takes into
account continuous monitoring and the duration of monitoring,
the longer the duration, the more likely a ‘too cold’ event is to be
discovered. Thus, for instance, the decrease in shipments in lower
income countries observed with ‘too cold’ events between the two
studies may, in part, be due to the inclusion of studies with less
continuous monitoring in this study as compared to the 2007 arti-
cle. These factors should be considered in the study design of
future temperature monitoring studies.
Recommendations ranged from technical guidance of vaccine
placement in storage units and cold chain product preferences to
the development of local and national guidelines. The majority of
studies recognized the importance of engaging all segments of cold
chain staff by providing ongoing educational sessions and training
sessions aimed at new staff members [11–14]. Supervision was
another area of concern. Some articles mentioned the designation
of one or two persons to supervise cold chain temperatures as a
way to improve supervision and accountability [15,16]. Finally,
some articles reported a need for the development of local or
national guidelines [17,18] to have clear back up plans to reduce
vaccine loss in the event of electrical failure and a need for making
current guidelines readily available to staff [19,20].
Of utmost importance is the link between vaccine exposure to
temperatures below recommendations and disease outbreaks. In
a 20-year period, Micronesia did not have a single reported case
of measles. However, in 2014 a relatively large measles outbreak
occurred where more than half of all cases were vaccinated adults
[21]. Micronesia’s cold chain had a history of cold chain breaches,
including freezing temperatures during transport, which point to
possible causes of vaccine failure [21]. Ambient freezing tempera-
tures during winter in Mongolia can be as low as �15 �C. Though
the temperatures of vaccine storage units were not evaluated, chil-
dren vaccinated during winter months were over two times more
likely to become diagnosed with Hepatitis B implying the inactiva-
tion of Hepatitis B vaccine due to exposure to freezing tempera-
tures [22]. Finally, a study in the United States noted that health
regions with higher percentages of refrigerators with frozen tem-
peratures also had higher rates of pertussis [23].
Although this study presents current information on vaccine
temperature monitoring and vaccine exposure to temperatures
considered ‘too cold’, there are several limitations. Altogether,
these studies represent a very small number of worldwide ship-
ments, storage units and outreach sessions. Also, the number of
studies from upper-middle to high-income countries is similar to
those from low to -lower-middle income countries; however, more
studies are from the African (12) and West Pacific (12) regions.
Thus, while these study findings may be indicative, it is difficult
to characterize them as representative of the global reality.
Studies were subject to a variety of biases. Selection bias may
have occurred in the selection of study sites or shipment routes.
It is difficult to discern if, in some studies, sites or routes were cho-
sen due to past good performance, new equipment or ease of
accessibility.
5. Conclusion
This updated review highlights continuing issues of vaccine
exposure to ‘too cold’ temperatures during various segments of
the cold chain. The number of rigorous studies available from
countries has increased and plays an important role in the detec-
tion of ‘too cold’ temperatures.

 Since 2007, the number of freeze-sensitive vaccines procured by
UNICEF Supply Division (SD) for countries immunization programs
increased by 50%. In 2015, freeze-sensitive vaccines procured
through UNICEF SD totaled a value of $1.2 billion USD [24], high-
lighting the importance of monitoring vaccine exposure to ‘too
cold’ temperatures. More rigorous monitoring studies are needed
as well as more research to better understand instances of vaccine
exposure to ‘too cold’ temperatures and the link to disease out-
breaks. As freezing remains a problem, the new categories of pre-
qualification status for user independent freeze-free cold chain
equipment will be necessary. In addition, the emergence of actual
technologies on the market that meet freeze safety standards and
uptake of these technologies by consumers will be essential.
Finally, until thermostable vaccines and freeze-free technologies
become available in every country, countries can improve vaccine
exposure to freezing by implementing continuous temperature
monitoring, improving health worker training, accountability,
supervision and the access and development of national and local
guidelines regarding vaccine storage and freezing vaccines.
