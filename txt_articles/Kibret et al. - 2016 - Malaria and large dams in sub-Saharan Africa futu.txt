Africa: future impacts in a changing climate

Abstract 
Background: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has embarked on a new era of dam building to improve food security and 
promote economic development. Nonetheless, the future impacts of dams on malaria transmission are poorly under-
stood and seldom investigated in the context of climate and demographic change.
Methods: The distribution of malaria in the vicinity of 1268 existing dams in SSA was mapped under the Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5. Population projec-
tions and malaria incidence estimates were used to compute population at risk of malaria in both RCPs. Assuming no 
change in socio-economic interventions that may mitigate impacts, the change in malaria stability and malaria bur-
den in the vicinity of the dams was calculated for the two RCPs through to the 2080s. Results were compared against 
the 2010 baseline. The annual number of malaria cases associated with dams and climate change was determined for 
each of the RCPs.
Results: The number of dams located in malarious areas is projected to increase in both RCPs. Population growth will 
add to the risk of transmission. The population at risk of malaria around existing dams and associated reservoirs, is esti-
mated to increase from 15 million in 2010 to 21–23 million in the 2020s, 25–26 million in the 2050s and 28–29 million 
in the 2080s, depending on RCP. The number of malaria cases associated with dams in malarious areas is expected to 
increase from 1.1 million in 2010 to 1.2–1.6 million in the 2020s, 2.1–3.0 million in the 2050s and 2.4–3.0 million in the 
2080s depending on RCP. The number of cases will always be higher in RCP 8.5 than RCP 2.6.
Conclusion: In the absence of changes in other factors that affect transmission (e.g., socio-economic), the impact of 
dams on malaria in SSA will be significantly exacerbated by climate change and increases in population. Areas with-
out malaria transmission at present, which will transition to regions of unstable transmission, may be worst affected. 
Modifying conventional water management frameworks to improve malaria control, holds the potential to mitigate 
some of this increase and should be more actively implemented.

Background
Dams are widely associated with malaria
More than 2000 large dams have been built and over 200 
are currently under construction or planned in sub-Saha-
ran Africa (SSA), with the aim of enhancing food security, 
increasing hydropower generation, managing variabil-
ity and promoting economic growth [1]. Despite these 
social and economic benefits, there is a growing body of 
evidence that dams frequently intensify malaria trans-
mission in SSA. For instance, increased malaria has been 
documented following the construction of the Bamendjin 
Dam in Cameroon [2], the Kamburu Dam in Kenya [3], 
the Koka reservoir in central Ethiopia [4, 5], the Gilgel 
Gibe Dam in southwest Ethiopia [6], the Manyuchi Dam 
in Zimbabwe [7], the Diama Dam in Senegal [8], and the 
Akosombo Dam in Ghana [9]. The overall malaria impact 
of dams at regional scale has also been assessed. Keiser 
et al. [10] postulated that 3.1 million people were at risk 
of malaria due to dams in SSA. Using a more extensive 
data set, Kibret et al. [11] estimated that more than 15

million people were at risk and that 1.1 million cases a 
year were associated with 1268 large dams in SSA.
Dam‑malaria impacts do not occur in a vacuum
The distribution and intensity of malaria is influenced by 
ecological, entomological and climatic factors through 
their influence on both the vector and the parasite [12]. 
Rainfall is the ultimate control on the availability of 
breeding habitat for mosquito vectors [13], and tempera-
ture determines the length of development of larval mos-
quitoes and malaria parasites [14], as well as the lifespan 
and the rate of blood feeding of adult vectors [15, 16]. 
Dams must, therefore, be considered in the context of 
these factors to fully understand their impact. A recent 
review, for example, indicated that the degree to which 
dams enhance malaria in SSA is in part a function of 
malaria transmission stability. It found that dams signifi-
cantly increased malaria in areas of unstable (seasonal) 
transmission but had a much lower effect in areas of sta-
ble (perennial) transmission [17].
Climate change may alter dams’ impact on malaria
Climate change will increase temperature and modify 
rainfall patterns in SSA [18]. Although early studies pre-
dicted widespread increase in malaria transmission due 
to climate change [19–23], more recent literature sug-
gest a shift in distribution rather than a large net increase 
[24–26]. For instance, a recent report indicated that 
future climate might render the tropical highland regions 
more suitable for malaria transmission [27]. However, the 
likely consequences of climate change remain uncertain, 
in part because disease transmission is also determined 
by non-climate factors (e.g., malaria control activities, 
access to health care, socio-economic, environmental 
and behavioural factors) that can exacerbate or negate 
climatic influences [28–30]. Furthermore, there exists an 
ongoing debate on the level of uncertainty of future cli-
mate projections and their biophysical impacts, which 
result from uncertainty in both the greenhouse gas emis-
sion trajectory and the results of model simulations [18].
No study has examined future impacts of dams in light 
of climate change
While there is one important body of work that exam-
ines dams and malaria in Africa [11] and a growing body 
of work assessing climate change and malaria [19–30], 
there has been no study to date that explicitly exam-
ines future malaria transmission around dams in light 
of climate change. As water storage provides potential 
mosquito breeding habitats and climate determines the 
development of mosquitoes and malaria parasites, it is 
important to understand how their interaction affects 
malaria transmission in the context of changing climate. 
This knowledge will help to devise optimal interventions 
and allocation of resources to fight disease transmission 
around dams.
Estimating impact
The objective of the present study was to assess future 
malaria transmission in the vicinity of reservoirs in light 
of climatic change and projected population increases. 
For RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, the number of dams, popu-
lation at risk and malaria cases in stable and unstable 
areas were estimated for future time intervals: the 2020s 
(i.e., 2020–2029), 2050s (i.e., 2050–2059) and 2080s (i.e., 
2080–2089). Finally, the number of malaria cases associ-
ated with dams, climate change and population growth 
were determined separately for each time interval. This 
study is an extension of the previously published study 
[11].
Methods
Study area
The study was conducted in SSA. This region accounts 
for 90 % of the global malaria burden, i.e., 174 million 
cases annually [31]. Currently, malaria transmission is 
generally stable in western and central Africa, unstable in 
much of eastern Africa and unstable or absent in south-
ern Africa [32]. In SSA, intensive malaria control efforts 
since the beginning of the twenty-first century, have 
resulted in a reduction of malaria-associated mortality 
by 45 % and 1.6 million fewer malaria deaths occurred 
between 2001 and 2015 [33]. Encouraged by this pro-
gress, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set 
ambitious goals to reduce the global malaria burden by 
90 % by 2030 when compared to 2015 [33].
Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent and most 
fatal malaria parasite in the region [31]. Anopheles gam-
biae and Anopheles funestus are the predominant malaria 
vector species in wet and humid areas, while Anopheles 
arabiensis is the most common vector in drier climates 
[34, 35]. The variation in intensity of malaria transmis-
sion across SSA is partly the result of the relative abun-
dance of these species across different ecological settings 
[36].
Data source
The present study used four major data sources: (1) pre-
viously published global maps that show the future dis-
tribution of malaria under RCP 2.6 and 8.5 [27]; (2) 
databases of currently existing large dams; (3) projected 
population for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s; and, (4) the 
Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) database of malaria inci-
dence. These were used to estimate the population at 
risk around dams in areas of stable and unstable malaria 
transmission and to determine the possible impact of

climate change on malaria transmission in the vicinity of 
reservoirs behind large dams.
Data on existing African dams
The distribution of existing dams in SSA was mapped 
using the geo-referenced locations of individual dams in 
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) African 
dam database [37] and the International Rivers database 
[38]. Data on water storage capacity, dam height and res-
ervoir surface area were obtained from the World Reg-
ister of Dams [39] and the Global Reservoirs and Dams 
(GRanD) database [40]. Locations and parameters of 
additional dams were obtained from a number of journal 
articles, project reports and dissertations. Overall, geo-
referenced locations and dam parameters were obtained 
for a total of 1268 existing dams (out of an estimated total 
of over 2000 [40]) in SSA (see Additional file 1).
Estimating reservoir perimeters
Data on reservoir perimeter are necessary to estimate 
the population at risk of malaria due to a dam. How-
ever, these data are not available for most dams, so res-
ervoir perimeter was estimated using a method adapted 
from Keiser et al. [10]. The method estimated the perim-
eter based on dam and reservoir characteristics and an 
assumed rectangular shape. (For more details see Kibret 
et al. [11]).
Malaria data
The MAP database [41] assembled all existing malaria 
surveys to produce a global spatiotemporal malaria 
dataset at a 1 × 1-km spatial resolution. The data were 
interpolated within a Bayesian space–time geo-statistical 
framework to predict the average P. falciparum infec-
tion rate (PfIR) in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s using 
biological models based on estimated average tempera-
ture increases in future years. These predictions were 
calibrated using the 2000–2010 malaria dataset from 
literature and the WHO [42]. This database was used to 
estimate the PfIR around dam-associated reservoirs in 
SSA for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s in both RCP 2.6 and 
8.5.
Non-linear relationships between malaria incidence 
and climatic predictor variables (i.e., temperature and 
rainfall) were constructed using a genetic programming 
method, to predict the spatial distributions of malaria 
under climate change scenarios. Spatiotemporal scan 
analysis was performed to identify and quantify the spa-
tiotemporal clustering scales of malaria incidence to 
empirically estimate the relationship between malaria 
incidence and climatic factors using the output of the 
MAP Bayesian statistical model, which combines malaria 
survey data with climate predictors to provide a gridded 
malaria incidence for each of the future time intervals. 
Details of the spatiotemporal malaria incidence predic-
tion procedures are documented in MAP database [41].
The classification described by Gething et al. [43] was 
used to characterize the epidemiological settings in 
which the dams were located. These were defined as:
  
•
stable transmission in areas with annual PfIR greater 
than 0.1 cases per 1000 population;
  
•
unstable transmission in areas with annual PfIR 
between 0 and 0.1 cases per 1000 population; and
  
•
no malaria in areas having zero annual PfIR.
Future climate scenarios
Caminade et al. [27] developed malaria maps using 
a multi-malaria model, which comprised five well-
known, process-based, malaria models (i.e., LMM_RO, 
MIASMA, VECTRI, UMEA, MARA) driven by climate 
outputs from five global circulation models (GCMs) (i.e., 
HadGem2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, 
GFDL-ESM2M, NorESM1-M). These all employed bias-
corrected temperature and rainfall data from the coupled 
model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5). A com-
mon metric (i.e., length of malaria transmission season) 
was used to compare all malaria models. Separate maps 
were produced for each of the four Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) RCPs: (i.e., RCP 2.6, 
RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5), for three future time inter-
vals (i.e., 2020s, 2050s, 2080s). RCPs are time and space-
dependent trajectories of concentrations of greenhouse 
gases and pollutants resulting from human activities, 
including changes in land use. RCPs provide a quantita-
tive description of concentrations of the climate change 
pollutants in the atmosphere over time, as well as their 
radiative forcing in 2100 (for example, RCP 6 achieves an 
overall impact of 6 W per sq. m by 2100). Radiative forc-
ing, expressed as Watts per sq. m, is the additional energy 
taken up by the Earth system due to the enhanced green-
house effect. The four RCPs illustrate the range of year-
2100 radiative forcing values found in the literature, i.e., 
from 2.6 to 8.5 W per sq. m [44]. Details of the selection 
process and parametrization are documented in Cami-
nade et al. [27].
Among the four RCPs, two (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) 
were selected for the current study in order to show how 
malaria distribution changes between the lowest (i.e., 
RCP 2.6) and the highest (RCP 8.5). The maps for each 
RCP and time interval were overlaid separately on the 
malaria and dam distribution maps to develop future 
malaria distribution scenarios around dams in the 2020s, 
2050s and 2080s.

Population data
1 × 1-km gridded projected future SSA annual popula-
tion data were obtained from the International Institute 
for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) for RCP 2.6 and 
8.5, for the three future time intervals [45]. In each RCP, 
the average population in the decade was determined 
and the data were imported to ArcGIS and overlaid on 
the dam-malaria-climate distribution maps. The popu-
lation around dams (i.e., within 5-km radius) was then 
calculated separately for zones of stable, unstable and no 
malaria transmission for each time interval and climate 
scenario. The impact of a dam on malaria was assumed 
to be negligible beyond 5 km due to mosquitoes’ lim-
ited flight range [46]. Also, the population concentration 
around reservoir relative to non-reservoir communities 
was assumed constant between 2020s and 2080s.
Statistical analysis
Mapping dams and malaria in climate change scenarios
The locations of dams were overlaid on the malaria-cli-
mate scenario maps to develop separate maps for RCP 
2.6 and RCP 8.5 in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s using Arc-
GIS. For both RCPs, the number of dams in each malaria 
transmission stability zone (i.e., stable, unstable and no 
malaria) was counted for each future time interval.
Estimating population at risk around dams
Future populations were analysed separately for the two 
RCPs. It should be noted that future population pro-
jections vary between RCPs: the SSA population in the 
2080s is estimated to be 1.55 billion and 1.65 billion in 
RCP 2.6 and 8.5, respectively. The populations at risk of 
malaria (<5 km) around existing dam-associated reser-
voirs in areas supporting stable and unstable transmis-
sion were estimated for the two RCPs for each of the 
three time intervals.
Estimating future malaria incidence around reservoirs
Using MAP spatiotemporal malaria database, annual 
PfIRs (hereafter called malaria incidence) for reservoir 
communities (i.e., located within 5 km of a reservoir 
shoreline) and non-reservoir communities (i.e., located 
5–10 km from a reservoir-shoreline) were estimated for 
the two RCPs for each of the three time intervals. The 
annual malaria incidences in reservoir and non-reser-
voir communities were compared in stable and unsta-
ble areas for each RCP in each time interval. Previously 
documented data of annual malaria incidence for 2010 
[11] were used as a baseline against which to measure the 
degree of future change in malaria incidence. Chi square 
tests were employed to compare the differences in malaria 
incidence between malaria stability zones and across time 
intervals. The same test was carried out to determine 
whether the difference in malaria incidence between 
reservoir and non-reservoir communities was signifi-
cant within each malaria stability zone. Statistical analy-
ses were done using statistical software, SPSS version 22 
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The level of significance was 
determined at the 95 % confidence interval (P = 0.05).
Estimating future malaria cases associated with dams
For each time interval, projected annual malaria inci-
dence was multiplied by the population within 5 km 
and 5–10 km from reservoirs, to estimate the number of 
malaria cases in reservoir and non-reservoir communi-
ties, respectively, in areas of stable and unstable transmis-
sion. The number of annual malaria cases attributable to 
dams was estimated by calculating the difference in the 
number of annual malaria cases for communities less 
than 5 km and for communities 5–10 km from the reser-
voir, allowing for differences in population. The propor-
tion (%) of cases attributable to dams relative to the total 
malaria cases (<5 km) was also calculated.
Identifying the increase in malaria cases attributable only 
to population increase
To distinguish the increased malaria due to population 
growth from that associated with climate change, the 
number of malaria cases due solely to population growth 
was determined. The 2010 malaria incidence rate was 
applied to population increases (i.e., the change in pop-
ulation between the 2010 and the average population in 
future time intervals of the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s for 
each RCP) to calculate the number of additional malaria 
cases due to population increases in each of the three 
periods for each RCP.
Identifying the increase in malaria cases attributable only 
to climate change
For each RCP, the number of cases in 2010 and the num-
ber of additional cases associated with population growth 
were subtracted from the total malaria cases around 
dams in future time intervals. The results were con-
sidered to be the number of cases attributable solely to 
climate change. The difference in socio-economic and 
other environmental factors was assumed to be minimal 
between reservoir and non-reservoir communities. Pos-
sible impacts of further malaria control interventions and 
other non-climate factors (e.g., socio-economic develop-
ment) in the future were not captured.
Results
Spatial distribution of dams in future years as a 
consequence of changing climate
Depending on the RCP, the total area suitable for sta-
ble malaria transmission is projected to increase from 7

million sq. km in 2010 to 9–11 million sq. km in the 2080s 
across SSA (Fig. 1; Table 1). Concurrently, the area sup-
porting unstable transmission is predicted to shrink from 
14 million sq. km in 2010 to 11–13 million sq. km in the 
2080s and the non-malarious area is expected to decline 
from two million sq. km to 1.1–1.5 million sq. km over the 
same period. Between 2010 and the 2080s, the number of 
existing dams located in areas suitable for stable transmis-
sion is projected to increase from 307 currently, to 386 
(i.e., by 20 %) and to 427 (i.e., by 30 %) in RCP 2.6 and RCP 
8.5, respectively. Similarly, by the 2080s, the number of 
dams located in areas with unstable transmission is pro-
jected to increase from 416 to 640 (i.e., by 35 %) in both 
RCPs. In contrast, the number of dams located in areas 
with no malaria is predicted to reduce by 50–65 % in the 
2080s depending on the RCP, under the assumption that 
control measures have no further impact. 
Estimated future population at risk of malaria 
around dams in SSA
The number of people living in close vicinity to the 
1268 dam associated reservoirs (<5 km) is projected to 
increase steadily over the period to 2080s, with a consid-
erable increase in both stable and unstable transmission 
areas (Table 1). The total population living within 5 km 
of the reservoirs is estimated to increase from 20 million 
in 2010 to 21–23 million in the 2020s, 25–26 million in 
the 2050s and 28–29 million in the 2080s, depending on 
the RCP. The population at risk of malaria is substantially 
greater in RCP 8.5 scenario than RCP 2.6. In areas of sta-
ble transmission, the population within 5 km of reser-
voirs is projected to increase from 6.4 million in 2010 to 
7.2–8.7 million in the 2020s, 8.9–9.4 million in the 2050s 
and 10.1–11.0 million in the 2080s depending on RCP. 
Similarly, the population within 5 km in areas of unstable 
transmission is predicted to increase from 8.2 million in 
2010 to 9.2–10.3 million in the 2020s, 12.1–13.6 million 
in the 2050s and 14.7–15.2 million in the 2080s depend-
ing on the RCP. Overall, the population at risk of malaria 
is estimated to be consistently higher in areas of unstable 
than stable transmission in both RCPs.
Estimated malaria incidence around dams in future climate 
in SSA
Annual malaria incidence (cases per 1000 population per 
year) around existing dams (i.e., <5 km) in SSA is pro-
jected to increase in the future in areas of both stable 
and unstable transmission (Fig. 2). The annual malaria 
incidence in reservoir communities situated in areas of 
stable transmission is expected to increase by an average

of 30 % between 2010 and the 2080s in both RCPs, but 
this increase was not statistically significant (χ2 = 6.212; 
df = 2; P = 0.061). However, in areas of unstable trans-
mission, the annual malaria incidence is likely to increase 
twofold to threefold in the 2080s when compared to 
2010 and this difference was statistically significant 
(χ2 = 13.061; df = 2; P < 0.001) in both RCPs.
Annual malaria cases associated with dams in the future
In future years, depending on the RCP, the proportion 
of malaria cases attributable to dams relative to all cases 
around dams will be 19–61 % and 50–72 % in areas of sta-
ble and unstable transmission, respectively (Table 2). For 
both RCPs, the number of annual malaria cases around 
reservoirs in areas of stable transmission is projected 
to triple to 600,000–700,000 in the 2080s compared to 
2010. The number of cases associated with dams in areas 
with unstable transmission is estimated to increase from 
919,000 in 2010 to 1.7–2.6 million in the 2080s depend-
ing on the RCP. Thus, in the absence of improved mitigat-
ing measures, dams in SSA are expected to add 1.2–1.6 
million malaria cases annually in the 2020s and 2.4–3.0 
million cases annually in the 2080s. The malaria impact 
of dams is projected to be 1.8–2.3 (χ2 = 18.903; df = 2; 
P < 0.001) and 2.1–4.6 (χ2 = 33.615; df = 2; P < 0.001) 
times higher in unstable than stable areas across the 
future years in RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively.
Impacts of population growth
The number of additional malaria cases around dams 
due to population growth is expected to increase in the 
future in both RCPs (Table 3). In stable areas, the average 
annual number of malaria cases around dams due to 
population growth is estimated to be 205,000–587,000 in 
2020s, 639,000–777,000 in 2050s and 956,000–1.2 mil-
lion in 2080s. In unstable areas, additional malaria cases 
due to population rise is estimated to increase: from 
118,000–148,000 in the 2020s to 458,000–634,000 in the 
2050s and 763,000–823,000 in the 2080s depending on 
RCP.
Increases in malaria cases around dams attributable 
to climate change
The annual number of malaria cases around 1268 existing 
dams that is attributable to climate change is projected 
to increase in the future in both RCPs (Table 3). In areas 
of stable transmission, the annual number of malaria 
cases around dams due to climate change is estimated 
to be 281,000–373,000 in the 2020s, 491,000–1.0 million 
in the 2050s and 1.4–1.5 million in the 2080s depending 
on the RCP. By comparison, the number of malaria cases 
due to climate change in areas of unstable transmission is 
estimated to be 137,000–199,000 in the 2020s, 607,000–
1.6 million in the 2050s and 952,000–2.2 million in the 
2080s. The number of cases is generally expected to be 
higher in RCP 8.5 than RCP 2.6 scenario. The relative 
impact of climate change on malaria transmission is pro-
jected to be greater than the impact of population growth 
in all time intervals (Table 3). Note that total number of 
malaria cases in Tables 2 and 3 are not equivalent because 
while Table 2 presents the number of cases attributable 
to the presence of a dam, the figures in Table 3 show the 
number of cases due to climate change and population 
growth.

Discussion
Malaria transmission around dams in SSA to more 
than double by 2080s
The present findings have reinforced and amplified pre-
existing concerns related to current and future malaria 
transmission around dams in SSA. Assuming no change 
in socio-economic and disease intervention efforts, the 
dam-associated malaria burden in the vicinity of 1268 
dams in SSA is projected to increase from 1.1 million in 
2010 to 2.4–3.0 million in the 2080s. The population at 
risk of malaria around these dams is set to increase from 
15 million in 2010 [11] to 24–25 million in the 2080s. This 
study is the first of its kind to project the expected malaria 
burden associated with dams under future climatic con-
ditions. The estimates are conservative because no allow-
ance was made for the approximately 800 dams that have 
been built but for which geo-referenced locations were 
unavailable. Furthermore, future dam construction, also 
unaccounted for here, will exacerbate the trends.
Climate change exacerbates malaria around dams
The present study confirmed that the role of climate 
change on malaria around dams will be substantial. Con-
siderable number of malaria cases was associated with 
climate change and population growth and these are gen-
erally higher in the unstable than stable malarious areas. 
Zhou et al. [47] found a high spatial variation in the sensi-
tivity of malaria case number to climate fluctuation in the 
highlands of East Africa, where major dams are located. 
Thus, climate change could further exacerbate the impact 
of dams on malaria.
Malaria impact of climate change around dams is 
consistent with malaria impacts associated with future 
regional climate scenarios
Malaria is expected to increase in the future climate in 
the highland regions throughout Africa, including South 
Africa and Zimbabwe where more than half of SSA’s 
current large dams are located. Ebi et al. [48], for exam-
ple, projected an increase in the malaria suitability of 
Zimbabwean highlands. Likewise, Caminade et al. [27] 
indicated an increase in the length of the malaria trans-
mission season over the high altitude regions of Ethiopia, 
Kenya, Madagascar, South Africa, and Angola. Peter-
son [49] and Ermert et al. [50] predicted an increase in 
the suitability of the East African highlands for malaria 
by 2050. Siraj et al. [51] predicted that a 1 °C increase in 
daily mean temperature will result in three million addi-
tional malaria cases in the unstable transmission high-
lands of Africa. Spatial analyses by Tonnang et al. [52] 
indicated that malarious areas will expand southwards 
and eastwards of Africa in future climate scenarios. For 
most of these regions, climate becomes suitable in the 
future as a result of predicted temperature rises.
Relative impact of dams vs climate change: interpreting 
attribution
This study determined the number of malaria cases 
attributable to dams in the future as well as the number 
of cases in the vicinity of dams that are attributable to cli-
mate change. Comparison of such numbers reveals two 
things. First, while the impacts of dams are greater in the 
2020s, the relative impact of climate change around dams 
increases over time such that the malaria impacts asso-
ciated with climate change overtake those due to dams 
by the 2080s. Second, despite this trend toward greater 
climate change impacts, dams generally remain a greater 
risk factor than climate change in areas of unstable 
malaria transmission.
Greater impacts in a smaller area: explaining a paradox
The present study found that the rate of malaria trans-
mission around dams in unstable areas increases 
despite the fact that the aggregate size of unstable areas 
decreases. This seemingly paradoxical future is explained 
by the possibility that relatively dam-dense areas, with 
no malaria transmission at present, could transition to 
regions of unstable transmission due to climate change. 
Particular areas of concern for emerging malaria around 
dams are South Africa, Zimbabwe and highland areas in 
Ethiopia and Kenya. The influence of dams on malaria 
could be of concern in such areas given that populations 
will often lack any immunity to the disease. Conversely, 
the magnitude of such impact may not be easily felt in 
countries like South Africa where strong malaria control 
programmes exist.
Malaria around dams in the context of broader efforts 
towards malaria reduction
Despite the ongoing efforts to develop models to pre-
dict the impacts of future climate, there remains nota-
ble uncertainty in their robustness. The malaria models 
adopted in the present study [27] did not incorporate 
socio-economic, land use, disease interventions (e.g., 
bed net usage), and other environmental factors (e.g., 
topography), all of which influence the distribution and 
intensity of malaria in SSA. Gething et al. [53], for exam-
ple, shows that despite a climate that warmed over the 
twentieth century, malaria has declined globally due to 
economic growth and implementation of control pro-
grammes. Although the degree of future support of 
malaria control in SSA is uncertain [31], it must be rec-
ognized that the malaria projections will not necessarily 
translate into actual changes in malaria risk. Ultimately, 
 Page 11 of 14
Kibret et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:448 
such evidence of past progress should serve to encourage 
renewed emphasis on control in order to help ensure the 
potential increased risk associated with climate change 
and dams is mitigated, and transmission of the disease 
is indeed rolled back. Targeted intensification of malaria 
interventions may certainly curb a considerable amount 
of the potential malaria increase [53].
The evolving nature of malaria transmission stability 
around dams: implications for control efforts
Given the increasing evidence of greater malaria impacts 
of dams in unstable areas, and the fluid nature of zones 
of malaria transmission stability, valid questions may be 
posed about how to best match the degree of control to 
the degree of threat. It would seem that in areas predicted 
to transition from unstable to stable transmission, dams 
will gradually shift to wielding relatively less of an impact 
on surrounding communities. As such, control efforts in 
such areas may progressively diversify away from heavy 
focus on the dam to a broader set of risk factors. Con-
versely, in areas transitioning from no malaria to unstable 
malaria, the impacts of dams could be disastrous as com-
munities and health systems are less likely to be equipped 
to cope with the disease. In these areas, it will be criti-
cal to progressively roll out control programs as the dis-
ease transmission spreads. To achieve the significant 
decreases proposed by the Roll Back Malaria Partnership 
[32], foresight must be applied so that limited disease 
intervention resources are optimally targeted.
Climate‑proofing malaria control around dams
This study determined that the threat of adverse impacts 
from dams in SSA will grow in future years. As areas of 
unstable transmission expand in eastern and southern 
Africa, at least two modifications to malaria interven-
tion efforts around dams may be needed to sustain the 
current advances in reducing transmission of the dis-
ease. First, health impact assessments (HIAs) that are 
routinely conducted for dams should consider malaria 
impacts today and tomorrow. In particular, risks associ-
ated with future malaria transmission should be clearly 
flagged for dams constructed in ‘fringe areas’
, presently 
outside of the zone of transmission but in which malaria 
is predicted to expand. Second, the amplification of dis-
ease transmission, and uncertainty associated with the 
altered pathways of transmission, may be best mitigated 
with a diversified approach to control that draws on 
both conventional and unconventional measures. Cur-
rent malaria interventions mainly rely on bed nets and 
indoor residual spraying. Alternative control measures, 
such as reservoir management that suppress shoreline-
associated mosquito breeding habitats, have previously 
been used in the western world and proved to be effective 
and economically viable [54, 55]. However, reservoir 
management has never been used as a malaria control 
tool in Africa despite growing evidence of its potential 
[56–58]. Measures such as this, focused on mosquito 
larval management, could supplement existing malaria 
interventions.
Caveats
Three methodological limitations should be pointed 
out. First, the study did not include about one-third 
of currently existing dams due to their lack of geo-
referenced data. Second, the study did not consider 
planned dams. Failing to incorporate more than one-
third of existing dams, and all future dams, means 
that: (i) modelled predictions of future malaria trans-
mission are likely to underestimate actual transmis-
sion, and, (ii) the magnitude of impact of dams across 
regions and malaria transmission zones may be some-
what distorted. Third, the potential impact of control 
efforts was not included as a covariate. While incorpo-
rating potential impacts of control may have helped to 
achieve a more accurate depiction of future conditions, 
predicting the degree of malaria reduction associated 
with interventions around dams that is achieved and 
sustained is not straightforward. Evidence on inter-
vention impacts around dams is indeed scant, and evi-
dence on sustainability of such impacts is non-existent. 
As such, quantification of the disease reduction result-
ing from interventions around dams could not be confi-
dently undertaken.
Future research
The present study only examined the potential malaria 
risk associated with future climate scenarios around large 
dams in SSA using population and climate data. More 
localized studies should explore malaria risk associated 
with climate change in the vicinity of dams using robust 
data on socio-economic, disease intervention, vector 
distribution, and other environmental variables. Future 
investigations need also to assess how temperature and 
rainfall changes will affect run-off, future dam develop-
ment, and hence future dam operations. Understanding 
this broader picture will in turn provide a more holistic 
understanding of dam impacts on malaria transmission.
More broadly, future work will do well to identify and 
address structural bottlenecks for incorporating malaria 
control into water resources planning and management. 
Notably, the present findings add to a growing body of 
evidence (cited in the “Background” of this paper) on 
malaria transmission around large dams in Africa. Nev-
ertheless, the degree to which relevant policies and man-
agement approaches have been modified in light of this 
evidence is debatable. While the need for intersectoral 
 Page 12 of 14
Kibret et al. Malar J  (2016) 15:448 
collaboration has indeed been widely highlighted as a 
suggested response option [59], the lack of action in this 
regard calls for greater scrutiny into institutional con-
straints for operationalization.
More dams in the future
Moving forward, dam building in Africa will continue 
and may even accelerate. In 2012, the continent’s heads 
of state and government laid out an ambitious, long-term 
plan for closing Africa’s infrastructure gap [60]. In the 
water and power sector, the Programme for Infrastruc-
ture Development in Africa (PIDA) calls for an expan-
sion of hydroelectric power generating capacity by more 
than 54,000 MW and of water storage capacity by 20,000 
cubic km. In response to this, Ethiopia has built several 
dams in recent years that have helped satisfy its growing 
energy demand, and the country is currently building an 
additional eight large dams, including the huge Grand 
Renaissance Dam [61]. In central Africa, the Demo-
cratic Republic of Congo has initiated the construction 
of several dams along the Congo River at Inga Falls [62]. 
In West Africa, several dams have been planned or are 
under construction, including the Fomi Dam in Guinea, 
Toussa Dam in Mali, and Kandadji Dam in Niger [63]. 
In southern Africa, the height of the Kamuzu barrage is 
being augmented in Malawi, and feasibility studies have 
identified lucrative hydropower potential on the Ruo, 
which straddles the Malawi-Mozambique border [64]. 
These extensive dam constructions should therefore 
be carefully analysed so that proper malaria mitigation 
measures can be implemented while designing and oper-
ating them.
Conclusions
The findings of this study highlight the potential for cli-
mate change to significantly add to the malaria burden 
in the vicinity of large dams in SSA. There is a need for 
upstream planning and diversification of control efforts 
in order to cope with the climate change impacts of 
malaria around dams. Future dam constructions should 
consider optimizing dam management to incorporate 
malaria control measures during design and operation. 
Although dams remain extremely important for socio-
economic development, the potential amplification of 
their adverse health impacts calls for smarter approaches 
built on a foundation of collaboration between water 
managers and health authorities.
