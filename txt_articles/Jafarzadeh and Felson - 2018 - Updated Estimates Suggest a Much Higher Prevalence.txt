 Updated Estimates Suggest a Much Higher Prevalence of
Arthritis in United States Adults Than Previous Ones

Objective. National estimates of arthritis preva-
lence rely on a single survey question about doctor-diag-
nosed arthritis without using survey information on joint
symptoms, even though some subjects with only the latter
have been shown to have arthritis. The sensitivity of the
current surveillance definition is only 53% and 69% in
subjects ages 45–64 years and ages ≥65 years, respec-
tively, resulting in misclassification of nearly one-half
and one-third of subjects in those age groups. This study
was undertaken to estimate arthritis prevalence based on
an expansive surveillance definition that is adjusted for
the measurement errors in the current definition.
Methods. Using the 2015 National Health Inter-
view Survey, we developed a Bayesian multinomial latent
class model for arthritis surveillance based on doctor-
diagnosed arthritis, joint symptoms, and whether symp-
tom duration exceeded 3 months.
Results. Of 33,672 participants, 19.3% of men and
16.7% of women ages 18–64 years and 15.7% of men and
13.5% of women ages ≥65 years affirmed joint symptoms
without doctor-diagnosed arthritis. The measurement
error–adjusted prevalence of arthritis was 29.9% (95%
Bayesian probability interval [95% PI] 23.4–42.3) in men
ages 18–64 years, 31.2% (95% PI 25.8–44.1) in women ages
18–64 years, 55.8% (95% PI 49.9–70.4) in men ages ≥65
years, and 68.7% (95% PI 62.1–79.9) in women ages ≥65
years. Arthritis affected 91.2 million adults (of 247.7 mil-
lion; 36.8%) in the US in 2015, which included 61.1 million
persons between 18 and 64 years of age (of 199.9 million;
30.6%). Our arthritis prevalence estimate was 68% higher
than the previously reported national estimate.
Conclusion. Arthritis prevalence in the US pop-
ulation has been substantially underestimated, espe-
cially among adults younger than 65 years of age.
Arthritis is a highly prevalent condition in the US
and a leading cause of disability. The economic burden of
arthritis is estimated to be at least $128 billion annually in
the US (1). Effective surveillance of arthritis on a national
scale is challenging and requires a screening strategy that
goes beyond recognizing symptoms reported in a clinical
setting.
National surveillance efforts for arthritis rely on
self-report surveys as a practical tool to estimate the bur-
den of disease. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) routinely publishes estimates of the
prevalence of arthritis in the US (2–4). One source of data
used for arthritis surveillance is the National Health Inter-
view Survey (NHIS), administered by the US Census
Bureau, which includes questions that are used to identify
cases of arthritis. Although identifying subjects with arthri-
tis from these health surveys is a reasonable method for
national surveillance efforts, the accuracy of estimates
depends on the validity of the surveillance definition used
to identify cases of arthritis. The main item from the NHIS
used to identify cases of arthritis has been a single question
asking subjects if they ever had doctor-diagnosed arthritis.
In a validation study in which they actually verified
clinical cases of arthritis, Sacks et al (5) documented the
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of arthritis-related sur-
vey questions. Survey validation has shown reassuring but
imperfect accuracy. While a survey approach using a report
of doctor-diagnosed arthritis had a higher sensitivity
(68.8%) among those ages ≥65 years, the sensitivity of this
surveillance definition was lower (52.5%) for persons ages
45–64 years. Such a low sensitivity, especially in a younger
population, where almost half of true arthritis cases are
missed, results in substantial misclassification and underes-
timation of prevalence and would have a detrimental effect
on planning and needs assessment (3,4).
Subsequent studies that have relied on the assur-
ance of the Sacks et al (5) validation study have produced

 a national estimate of the prevalence of arthritis or of doc-
tor-diagnosed arthritis of 54.4 million adults (22.7%) in
the US in 2015 (3,4). No data have been released that cor-
rect these estimates for the measurement errors caused by
the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of surveillance defi-
nitions (3,4,6). Further, this likely underestimation of
arthritis prevalence, especially in subjects ages 45–64 years,
has suggested that prevalence in this age group is low at a
time when other studies noted a marked increase in the
rates of knee and hip replacement in this age group (7).
Strategies exist to increase the accuracy of surveil-
lance criteria, such as combining the results of multiple
individual diagnostic criteria. For example, one diagnostic
criterion could be based on a self-reported diagnosis of
arthritis from a health professional. Another diagnostic
criterion could be self-reported symptoms that are consis-
tent with arthritis. Questions about chronic joint symp-
toms are in fact included in the NHIS, and the Sacks et al
(5) validation study reported that some subjects with
chronic joint symptoms who did not report having doctor-
diagnosed arthritis had a clinical diagnosis of arthritis.
Nonetheless, chronic joint symptoms have not been used
in combination with doctor-diagnosed arthritis to derive
national estimates of arthritis prevalence. While self-
reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis has an acceptable
specificity (i.e., 81.1%) for arthritis in adults ages ≥65
years (5), many persons younger than 65 years of age did
not report receiving a diagnosis from a health professional
despite reporting chronic joint symptoms.
In this study, we developed a Bayesian model to
estimate the prevalence of arthritis among adults in the
US in 2015, that is, an estimate adjusted for the measure-
ment errors due to the imperfect accuracy of surveillance
criteria based on both the report of chronic joint symp-
toms and doctor-diagnosed arthritis. We used the term
“adjusted prevalence,” in contrast to “unadjusted preva-
lence,” for our measurement error–corrected prevalence
estimates (8–13). We note that an adjusted prevalence
estimate obtained using a survey is not equivalent to the
exact number of rheumatologist-verified arthritis cases,
even though the survey questions were actually validated
against such cases, but we use the word “adjusted” to sug-
gest that we are correcting estimates for the systematic
underestimation of prevalence that occurs when surveil-
lance instruments with imperfect sensitivity are used.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study setting and data. We obtained the most recent pub-
licly available Sample Adult Core from the 2015 NHIS data
release, which contains data for individuals ages 18 years and
older. The NHIS, which is routinely used to derive national
estimates of arthritis prevalence, is one of the most prominent
population health surveys that covers the noninstitutionalized pop-
ulation in the US; it excludes those in long-term care facilities,
active duty armed forces personnel, and US nationals living in a
foreign country.
As noted in the study by Sacks et al (5), the National
Arthritis
Data
Workgroup
suggested
that
“arthritis”
be
broadly defined as a condition with clinical significance that is
either symptomatic or requires attention from a health pro-
fessional for treatment. The purpose of the definition, which
excluded injuries, was to have a practical method to estimate
the burden and impact of arthritis. For example, a case of
asymptomatic radiographic osteoarthritis resulting from a pre-
vious injury was not considered clinically significant, nor were
asymptomatic Heberden’s nodes.
In our study, identical to the definition used by the CDC,
a case of doctor-diagnosed arthritis was defined as a positive
response to the NHIS survey question, “Have you ever been told
by a doctor or other health professional that you have some form
of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia?”
In addition to doctor-diagnosed arthritis, the NHIS included a
separate set of questions designed to identify those with chronic
joint symptoms, defined as participants who gave a positive
response to the question, “The next questions refer to your joints.
Please do not include the back or neck. During the past 30 days,
have you had any symptoms of pain, aching, or stiffness in or
around a joint?” Moreover, if the person reported recent chronic
joint symptoms, they were asked the follow-up question, “Did
your joint symptoms first begin more than 3 months ago?” We
developed surveillance criteria based on the 3 questions that were
used to define doctor-diagnosed arthritis, chronic joint symptoms,
and whether the duration of symptoms exceeded 3 months.
Surveillance criteria. We considered each of the 3 ques-
tions described in the previous section as a diagnostic test with
imperfect accuracy for arthritis. The answer to the third question
regarding the duration of symptoms was only available (i.e., posi-
tive or negative) if the person reported the existence of recent
chronic joint symptoms. Therefore, the data consisted of fre-
quencies corresponding to one of the 6 possible realizations of
test outcomes (yes/yes/yes, yes/no/null, yes/yes/no, no/yes/yes, no/
no/null, or no/yes/no) for doctor-diagnosed arthritis, chronic
joint symptoms, and duration of symptoms, respectively. The
null value indicates that the value for the duration of symptoms
was not available due to a negative response to the recent
chronic joint symptoms criterion. We further stratified the
results of the surveillance criteria into 4 subpopulations based
on sex and the age groups 18–64 years and ≥65 years (T
able 1).
Model. We developed a Bayesian multinomial latent
class model for the 6 realizations of test outcomes in the 4 sub-
populations presented in T
able 1. Bayesian latent class models
have previously been used in a variety of models for diagnostic
test outcomes when a perfect reference standard is not available
(8–21). Latent class models do not require the true disease sta-
tus of each subject to be known (i.e., observed) in order to esti-
mate prevalence and measures of diagnostic accuracy (12,13).
The multinomial probabilities corresponding to the observed
frequencies of surveillance criteria were defined as functions of
true prevalence and the sensitivity and specificity of each crite-
rion, as described by Branscum et al (9) and others (10). For
example, the probability of observing (yes/yes/yes) frequency is a
product of the true arthritis prevalence and the sensitivities
of the 3 criteria in the surveillance definition, which is the
186
JAFARZADEH AND FELSON
 true-positive fraction plus the product of the prevalence of true
nonarthritis (i.e., 1 � the prevalence of true arthritis) and the
false-positive fraction (1 � the specificity of each criterion). All
multinomial probabilities corresponding to observed frequencies
are enumerated in the Supplementary Materials, available on
the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.
com/doi/10.1002/art.40355/abstract.
As shown in the validation study by Sacks et al (5) and
in other studies (17,22), the sensitivity of a diagnostic test is
often higher when it is applied to a population with higher
prevalence (in this case, this would be true of older versus
younger subjects). This occurs in part because there tends to be
more severe disease in a high-prevalence population (17,23). In
general, the diagnostic specificity, the probability of a negative
outcome in a truly healthy (i.e., non-diseased) population, where
the prevalence remains constant at 0, is less variable across non-
diseased populations. T
o obtain a more robust estimate for
arthritis prevalence (15,17), we allowed the sensitivity of the
surveillance criteria to differ across the 4 subpopulations of men
ages 18–64 years, women ages 18–64 years, men ages ≥65 years,
and women ages ≥65 years. In an alternative parameterization
for the purpose of sensitivity analysis, we assumed the sensitivity
of the surveillance criteria to be the same among men and
women, per estimates by Sacks et al (5), but to be different only
by age (i.e., higher sensitivity for the older population). The
alternative parameterization involves fewer parameters to be
estimated with the same degrees of freedom (i.e., 2 sensitivities
for each criterion instead of 4 sensitivities for each criterion in
the primary model). The number of parameters and degrees of
freedom affect model identifiability, as discussed below.
The diagnostic specificity of criteria can be increased by
serial interpretation of individual criteria results, that is, consider-
ing criteria positive when all individual components are positive.
On the other hand, parallel interpretation of diagnostic criteria,
that is, considering criteria positive when any individual compo-
nent is positive, results in increased diagnostic sensitivity at the
expense of reduced specificity. Similarly, sequential interpretation
of criteria, where an individual criterion result is available only if
another criterion is positive or negative, could result in improved
sensitivity or specificity. Since subjects with symptoms such as pain
are more likely to seek a health professional and receive a diagno-
sis of arthritis, we included conditional covariances, as described
Table 1.

ARTHRITIS PREVALENCE AMONG US ADULTS

 by Dendukuri and Joseph (24), to account for the potential
dependence between the outcomes for doctor-diagnosed arthritis
and chronic joint symptoms. Conditional dependence affects the
joint-testing sensitivity and specificity because the sensitivity (or
specificity) of a test would not be independent of the outcome of
another test (25). A positive dependence between the sensitivities
of the 2 tests occurs when the sensitivity of one test is lower
among truly diseased subjects who have negative results on the
other test and vice versa. Consequently, a positive or negative
dependence between the sensitivities of 2 diagnostic criteria
increases or decreases, respectively, serial joint-testing sensitivity.
Similarly, a dependence between test specificities affects joint-
testing accuracy (25).
Bayesian inference and priors. We used a Bayesian
approach (26) to estimate the parameters of the multinomial
latent class model for cross-classified outcomes of the arthritis
surveillance criteria. In this approach, probability distributions
are specified for model parameters, which consisted of the
arthritis prevalences for the 4 subpopulations, the sensitivities
and specificities of the surveillance criteria, and the conditional
covariances between the outcomes of the doctor-diagnosed
arthritis and chronic joint symptoms criteria. These probability
distributions are referred to as priors and are elicited from past
knowledge or expert opinion, or specified to be noninformative
when every possible value of the parameter is defined to have
an equal probability of occurring. The prior distributions are
updated with the observed data to obtain posterior distribu-
tions for the parameters of the model using Markov chain
Monte Carlo techniques (26). The Monte Carlo–based poste-
rior distributions are then summarized as the mean, median, or
mode and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the Monte Carlo
samples as Bayesian 95% probability intervals (95% PIs). For a
description of prior elicitation and all the priors specified for
the parameters of the multinomial model, see the Supplemen-
tary Materials, including Supplementary T
able 1, available on
the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.
wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40355/abstract.
In latent class models, non-identifiability occurs when
the model cannot guarantee a unique set of parameter esti-
mates, often due to insufficient degrees of freedom (27).
Non-identifiability can be mitigated with proper informative
priors or by putting constraints on priors in Bayesian analysis
(15,27,28). Hence, we ordered priors on prevalences and sen-
sitivities in the subpopulations such that the prior distribution
mean was higher in the older population than the younger
population and higher in women than in men.
Bayesian analysis was performed using JAGS software
(29) version 4.2.0 through rjags package (30) version 4-6 in
R software (31) version 3.3.3. Beta priors were elicited using
epiR package (32) version 0.9-79 in R. The program code for
running Bayesian computations was adapted from the study
by Branscum et al (9).
RESULTS
T
able 1 presents the cross-classified outcomes of
the arthritis surveillance criteria for 33,672 participants in
the 2015 NHIS. In subjects ages 18–64 years, 19.3% of
men (2,242 of 11,597) and 16.7% of women (2,294 of
13,697) responded “yes” to the question on chronic joint
symptoms, regardless of whether symptom duration
exceeded 3 months, but responded “no” to the question
of whether they had ever received a diagnosis of arthritis
from a doctor (T
able 1). Among those ages ≥65 years,
15.7% of men (545 of 3,474) and 13.5% of women (660 of
4,904) responded “yes” to the question on chronic joint
symptoms, regardless of symptom duration, without a
concurrent report of doctor-diagnosed arthritis (T
able 1).
The proportion who responded “yes” to having
doctor-diagnosed arthritis, with or without a concurrent
report of chronic joint symptoms or symptom duration
longer than 3 months if applicable, was 15.0% of
men ages 18–64 years (1,740 of 11,597), 20.0% of women
ages 18–64 years (2,734 of 13,697), 43.5% of men ages
≥65 years (1,511 of 3,474), and 55.1% of women
ages ≥65 years (2,704 of 4,904) (Table 1).
Posterior probability estimates and the corre-
sponding 95% PIs for the measurement error–adjusted
prevalences in the 4 subpopulations stratified by age and
sex are presented in Table 2. The posterior median for
the adjusted prevalence of arthritis based on the primary
model was 29.9% (95% PI 23.4–42.3) in men ages 18–64
years,
31.2%
(95%

in women
ages
18–64 years, 55.8% (95% PI 49.9–70.4) in men ages
≥65 years, and 68.7% (95% PI 62.1–79.9) in women
ages ≥65 years. The results of the sensitivity analysis that
used identical values for sensitivity of the criteria in men
and women suggested estimates similar to the results of
the primary analysis (i.e., with overlapping 95% PIs)
(Table 2).
The accuracy of the surveillance criteria is pro-
vided in T
able 3. The results suggested that the doctor-
diagnosed arthritis criterion had very low sensitivity in
subjects ages 18–64 years, and that the symptom duration
criterion had the highest sensitivity across all age and sex
strata, despite having the lowest specificity. Thus, a sub-
stantial fraction of the population with arthritis, who are
between 18 and 64 years of age, but are misclassified as

 healthy by the doctor-diagnosed arthritis criterion due to
low sensitivity, are captured by the 2 remaining questions
on joint pain, aching, or stiffness.
Finally, the estimated number of adults with
arthritis in the US, based on the 2015 National Popula-
tion Projections provided by the US Census Bureau
(33), was 91.2 million individuals (of the 247.7 million
total projected population; 36.8%), which included 29.8
million men ages 18–64 years, 11.8 million men ages
≥65 years, 31.3 million women ages 18–64 years, and
18.3 million women ages ≥65 years.
DISCUSSION
Using NHIS data, we developed an arthritis surveil-
lance definition by which to estimate the measurement
error–adjusted prevalence of arthritis in the US, based on
3 criteria with imperfect accuracy, i.e., doctor-diagnosed
arthritis, chronic joint symptoms, and symptom duration
longer than 3 months. Our estimate suggested that 91.2
million adults in the US (36.8%) were affected by arthritis
in 2015. Our results suggested that the adjusted prevalence
of arthritis, doctor-diagnosed or otherwise, is substantially
higher than a previously reported uncorrected estimate of
the prevalence of doctor-diagnosed arthritis of 54.4 million
adults in the US (22.7%) (4) and also higher than the esti-
mate of the adjusted prevalence of doctor-diagnosed
arthritis of 52.9 million adults (21.4%) (34). Further, we
estimated that 61.1 million adults between the ages of 18
and 64 years (of 199.9 million total adults ages 18–64
years; 30.6%) in the US had arthritis in 2015.
The higher prevalence that we report is due in
large part to the previous underestimate of arthritis in
adults ages 18–64 years. Recent reports have suggested a
marked increase in total knee replacement utilization,
especially in the population 45–64 years of age, that has
outpaced the increasing rate of obesity in the same age
group (7). Another study demonstrated higher arthritis
prevalence in more recent birth cohorts, compared to pre-
vious generations of the same age, partly due to changing
patterns of obesity in relatively younger populations (35).
Individuals younger than 65 years of age may perceive
arthritis as a condition affecting only the elderly and thus
may visit a health professional less often or may ignore
occasional joint symptoms. Moreover, arthritis may not
be reported on electronic health records or insurance
claims data if arthritis is not the primary reason for a
referral to a health care provider. A previous study noted
that of the total of 13.7% of adults (6,064 of 44,326) in
the 2005 NHIS data who had chronic joint symptoms but

opposed (36) the addition of chronic joint symptoms to an
arthritis surveillance definition, through creating a pseudo–
gold standard based on other criteria such as functional or
activity-limiting factors or any other indication of arthritis,
are subject to the same flaws and limitations of relying on
an imperfect surveillance definition. In contrast, our latent
class analytic approach did not rely on the assumption of
having a perfect reference standard (i.e., a gold standard)
and did not require us to identify the true arthritis status of
each individual in the population in order to estimate the
measurement error–adjusted prevalence (8,39).
The question on doctor-diagnosed arthritis in the
NHIS includes fibromyalgia among the conditions under
the arthritis rubric. While fibromyalgia can cause joint pain
and lead to a diagnosis by a health professional, it is not a
form of arthritis. Consequently, inclusion of fibromyalgia
resulted in an imperfect specificity for the doctor-diag-
nosed arthritis criterion, which affected the uncorrected
estimates for the prevalence reported in previous studies
(2–4); however, this inclusion did not affect our estimates
for the adjusted prevalence because we had already
corrected our estimate for the imperfect specificity of the
doctor-diagnosed arthritis criterion. Conversely, absence
of osteoarthritis, the most prevalent form of arthritis, from
the NHIS question on doctor-diagnosed arthritis results in
an imperfect sensitivity for the doctor-diagnosed arthritis
criterion and subsequently affected uncorrected estimates
for the prevalence in previous reports (2–4).
In addition to problems with measurement errors,
there are shortcomings in the reliance of the previously
published (3,4) national estimates of arthritis prevalence
on a single survey question regarding doctor-diagnosed
arthritis. Implicit in the question on doctor-diagnosed
arthritis, when the response is positive, is that the surveyed
individual sought or had access to medical care from a
health professional. However, a negative response to the
doctor-diagnosed arthritis question could be the result of
either lack of medical attention to joint symptoms or a truly
negative diagnosis with regard to arthritis. Moreover, an
individual who is diagnosed as having arthritis by a health
professional may never be explicitly informed of the
diagnosis.
The chronic joint symptoms question does not
require pain on more than half of days and could repre-
sent mild or moderate joint pain. We note that the valida-
tion study by Sacks et al (5) reported the sensitivity and
specificity of these questions for subjects who were ages
45–64 years. We generalized these estimates to those ages
18–64 years, and it is conceivable that our arthritis preva-
lence estimates for persons ages 18–44 years are off if
these estimates of sensitivity and specificity are imprecise.
However, our Bayesian approach mitigated this potential
inaccuracy by specifying diffuse prior distributions that
covered a wide range of sensitivity and specificity values,
in contrast to a frequentist approach, in which these val-
ues are assumed to be fixed.
The NHIS has a complex survey sample design,
and our approach did not use a weighting scheme to esti-
mate prevalence. There are conceptually competing and
fundamentally distinct approaches to making “infer-
ences” from complex surveys, which include the classical
design-based (randomization-based) approach that uses
a weighting scheme, as described by Neyman (40), and
our model-based approach that relies on developing sta-
tistical models to infer population parameters. While
weights are useful for “designing” a cost-effective survey
sample, their use in inference after survey data are col-
lected is debated in statistical literature because relying
on weighting alone may fail to sufficiently account for
other factors that influence the accuracy of estimation,
such as misclassification. Weights are not attributes of
the individuals or a particular disease under study, but
are constructed as a product of probability calculations
to correct for the perceived differences between a sam-
ple and a target population based on “design” variables
such as age, sex, or location (41).
There is a large body of statistical literature on the
philosophical and fundamental differences between the
design-based and the model-based approaches (see, for
example, refs. 41–43). Some argue that reliance on a gen-
eral framework to calculate weights, which requires many
arbitrary choices on weighting factor, pooling, or trunca-
tion of weights, does not provide much benefit over using
a model-based approach to directly estimate parameters
of interest, especially when auxiliary data are available
(i.e., accuracy of survey questions) or when faced with
biases unrelated to sampling weights, such as measure-
ment error. While the federal agencies have historically
produced statistical summaries using the design-based
approach (44), the US Census Bureau recently formed a
Research and Methodology Directorate to more effec-
tively utilize model-based approaches for inference in offi-
cial statistics by federal agencies (43). Our approach was
based on a model to adjust for the sensitivities and speci-
ficities of the test’s performance in the 4 subpopulations
identified by sex and age. We acknowledge that the
inability to directly apply weighting in our model-based
approach may have introduced inaccuracy with regard to
the precision of our estimates (i.e., wider PIs for the prob-
ability of true population parameters), but the gain in
190

 accuracy with regard to misclassification bias is so sub-
stantial that we believe it justifies our choice.
The validity of our Bayesian inference relies on
the correct specification and estimation of the underlying
probability distributions that generated the observed fre-
quencies of the NHIS questions’ outcomes in the 4 sub-
populations shown in Table 1. Our modeling approach
does not specify distinct priors on the diagnostic sensitiv-
ity and specificity of the NHIS questions across states,
because the validation study by Sacks et al (5) did not
provide evidence that the accuracy of NHIS questions
varied by state. Therefore, regardless of the sampling
unit from which an individual was selected, for example,
Massachusetts versus New York, the probability of
observing a specific realization of outcomes for the
NHIS questions for an individual relies only on whether
the individual has arthritis, and the sensitivities and
specificities of the questions.
Our model-based approach provides several ad-
vantages over previous studies that did not correct for
measurement errors (2–4). In addition to directly applying
the sensitivity and specificity of NHIS survey questions to
our estimates, we allowed the correlation (i.e., conditional
dependence) between responses to survey questions to be
formally incorporated to get corrected estimates. Further,
the Bayesian approach provided a coherent framework
for model-based re-validation (i.e., that does not rely on a
gold standard) of the findings of the Sacks et al (5) study,
through updating the sensitivities and specificities of the
survey questions from the validation study with the 2015
NHIS data, to obtain posterior probabilities (i.e., re-vali-
dated estimates), which we presented in T
able 3.
The underlying rheumatic diseases resulting in
arthritis are diverse. While our inference was limited to
aggregate-level population surveillance on the burden
of arthritis, further studies are needed to evaluate
potential changes in the specific causes of arthritis,
especially among adults younger than 65 years of age.
Arthritis causes enormous economic and public health
implications. Direct health care costs and long-term
indirect costs resulting from loss of productivity and
disability attributable to arthritis need be revised to
account for the corrected prevalence of arthritis affect-
ing individuals at younger ages than previously per-
ceived (1,45).
