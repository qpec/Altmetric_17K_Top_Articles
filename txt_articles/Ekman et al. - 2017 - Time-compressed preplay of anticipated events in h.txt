Time-compressed preplay of anticipated events
in human primary visual cortex
Matthias Ekman1, Peter Kok1,2 & Floris P. de Lange1
Perception is guided by the anticipation of future events. It has been hypothesized that this
process may be implemented by pattern completion in early visual cortex, in which a stimulus
sequence is recreated after only a subset of the visual input is provided. Here we test this
hypothesis using ultra-fast functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure BOLD activity
at precisely defined receptive field locations in visual cortex (V1) of human volunteers. We
find that after familiarizing subjects with a spatial sequence, flashing only the starting point of
the sequence triggers an activity wave in V1 that resembles the full stimulus sequence. This
preplay activity is temporally compressed compared to the actual stimulus sequence and
remains present even when attention is diverted from the stimulus sequence. Preplay might
therefore constitute an automatic prediction mechanism for temporal sequences in V1.

 T
he visual system is predictive in nature, anticipating
relevant
events
to
facilitate
sensory
processing
and
decision-making1. Prediction in perception has often
been studied in static contexts, where a stimulus is expected
because the base rate of occurrence is higher2 or because of
statistical
associations
between
stimuli3.
These
forms
of
prediction
can
be neurally
implemented
by pre-activating
sensory representations of the expected events4–6.
However, real-world predictions are typically dynamic: for
example, we predict the trajectory of a ball moving towards us or
whether a car will hit us if we cross the road. Implementing this
kind of dynamic prediction is more complex, as it requires an
anticipatory wave of visual responses that is both spatially and
temporally precise. Recently, such waves of preplay activity have
been observed in the visual cortical system of rats7 and monkeys8,
but the existence, function and potential source of preplay waves
in humans however remain unknown.
Here we tested whether human primary visual cortex (V1) is
engaged in dynamic prediction by preplaying anticipated visual
events. We characterized neural activity in the primary visual
cortex at both high spatial and temporal resolution, by combining
ultra-fast functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, using a
volume acquisition time (TR) of 88 ms) and population receptive
field (pRF) mapping9 to identify retinotopically specific responses
with high temporal resolution.
We found that flashing only the starting point of a moving dot
sequence triggered an activity wave in V1 that recreates the full
stimulus sequence. This anticipatory activity wave was temporally
compressed compared to the actual stimulus sequence and was
present even when attention was diverted from the stimulus
sequence.
This
preplay
activity
may
reflect
an
automatic
prediction mechanism for visual sequences.
Results
Probing preplay of stimulus sequences. Human observers
were exposed to a dot that rapidly moved across the screen
(stimulation condition) from left-to-right or right-to-left for
a 4 min period, while maintaining fixation (Fig. 1a). After
this exposure period, occasionally only the starting point
(preplay condition) or end point (no preplay condition) of the
sequence was flashed, omitting the remaining dots. We reasoned
that if V1 is involved in the prediction of anticipated events,
cortical activity during cue-triggered preplay should resemble the
activity during stimulus presentation at retinotopically defined
locations while preserving the temporal order of the dot sequence.
In contrast, flashing the end point is not associated with any
predictions and should thus not trigger an activity wave.
Moreover, to probe the automaticity of visual preplay, we
manipulated participants’ attentional state. In two separate sessions,
we instructed participants to either perform a covert attention task
on the dot sequence (attended condition) or a demanding task at
fixation
(unattended condition).
In the attended condition,
participants had to detect rare occasions on which the last dot of
the sequence was temporally delayed by 167 ms (reaction time
(RT), 515±97ms, mean±s.d.; error rate, 12%±10%). In the
unattended condition, participants were presented with a sequence
of rapidly changing letters at fixation and had to detect target letters
(see Methods for details; RT, 419±125 ms, mean±s.d.; error rate,
25%±14%). Halfway throughout each session, the direction of the
dot sequence was reversed (for example, from left-to-right to right-
to-left) and participants performed the same task after 4min of
exposure to the new sequence.
Preplay of anticipated stimulus sequences in V1. Physically
presenting the moving dot sequence triggered sequential activity
at the corresponding retinotopic locations in V1 (Fig. 1b).
Interestingly, briefly flashing a dot at the starting location elicited
a markedly similar wave of activity. In contrast, no activity wave
was observed when the end point of the sequence was flashed,
ruling out the possibility that the activity wave in V1 is simply
due to spatial spreading of the BOLD signal.
Next, we sought to characterize the BOLD activity trace in the
preplay condition compared to the stimulus condition with respect
to its amplitude and peak latency. Obviously, BOLD amplitude was
higher at retinotopically defined stimulus locations receiving
bottom-up input than during the preplay condition at these same
locations (Fig. 1c; attended condition, two-tailed t-test; t(28) ¼ 9.44,
P ¼ 3.39� 10� 10;
unattended
condition,
two-tailed
t-test;
t(28) ¼ 4.33, P ¼ 1.72� 10� 4). Crucially, there was larger BOLD
activity in these locations during preplay than during the control
condition (attended condition, two-tailed t-test; t(28) ¼ 16.50,
P ¼ 5.88� 10� 16;
unattended
condition,
two-tailed
t-test;
t(28) ¼ 14.76, P ¼ 9.79� 10� 15). Further, covert attention to the
dot locations led to increased BOLD amplitude (analysis of
variance (ANOVA); F(2,27) ¼ 4.70, P ¼ 2.63� 10� 6). Importantly,
withdrawing attention from the stimulus to fixation reduced the
BOLD amplitude in the stimulation and preplay condition to an
equal amount (stimulation: 53%; preplay: 51%; stimulation versus
preplay: two-tailed t-test; t(28) ¼ 1.22, P ¼ 0.31), suggesting an equal
amount of preplay during the attended and unattended conditions.
Averaged BOLD time courses are shown in Fig. 2. Control analyses
revealed that the preplay effect persists when using a variable
inter-trial interval (ITI) (Supplementary Fig. 5) and when the
stimulus sequence crosses through fixation (Supplementary Fig. 7).
To illustrate the spatial specificity of the activity spread we
performed a pRF-based reconstruction of the stimulus10,11 based
on all voxel in V1 (see Methods section). This visualization shows
clearly that the temporal wave is constrained to the approximate
stimulus locations (Fig. 3).
Temporal compression of preplayed activity. Does the activity
wave during preplay propagate faster than the activity wave during
stimulus presentation? Animal studies found that internally
generated sequence reactivations are often temporally compressed,
compared to the actual stimulus sequence7,12. During exposure to
the moving dot sequence, we found a monotonic increase in the
peak latency of the BOLD response for locations that were
stimulated later, reflecting the different onset times of the dot
sequence (Fig. 4a). The speed of the activity wave was quantified as
the slope of the best linear fit of the BOLD peak times across the
four stimulus locations. A temporal compression factor (TCF) was
calculated by dividing the slope of the stimulus condition by the
slope of the preplay condition (TCF41 indicates temporally
compressed preplay). In line with earlier electrophysiological
studies, we observed significant temporal compression in the
attended condition (two-tailed t-test; t(28) ¼ 6.45, P ¼ 6.59� 10� 7;
TCF ¼ 2.22±0.23, mean±s.e.m.) and in the unattended condition
(two-tailed t-test; t(28) ¼ 3.83, P ¼ 7.01 � 10� 4; TCF¼ 2.29±0.34,
mean±s.e.m.).
Preplay amplitude in V1 correlates with hMT þ amplitude.
The prediction signal in V1 might be generated within the
visual system or be the result of feedback from higher-level visual
areas encoding motion such as motion-sensitive area hMT þ
(refs 13,14). Indeed, hMT þ was significantly activated during
both the presentation of the moving dot sequence and preplay,
but not in the control condition (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, hMT þ
BOLD amplitude was correlated with V1 amplitude during
stimulation (attended condition, two-tailed t-test; t(28) ¼ 4.41,
P ¼ 1.39 � 10 � 4;
unattended
condition,
two-tailed
t-test;

Preplay facilitates the detection of upcoming events. Next
we examined whether the observed preplay waves might
have behavioural relevance, for example, by facilitating the
detection of upcoming stimulus events. To test this hypothesis,
we compared RTs and BOLD peak times for the delayed sequence
trials (Fig. 5a) in which participants had to respond as fast
as possible when the last dot of the stimulus sequence was
temporally delayed. We reasoned that if BOLD latency at the
final dot position depends on the anticipation of the final dot,
faster
BOLD
responses
may
allow
for
faster
behavioural
detection of the delayed stimulus sequence. Delayed sequence
trials were divided based on the median RT (RTMedian ¼
515 ms±105, mean±s.d.) into fast and slow detection trials
(RTFast ¼ 439 ms±101,
mean±s.d.;
RTSlow ¼ 633 ms±104,
mean±s.d.), separately for each participant. Results show that
BOLD time courses corresponding to the delayed dot location
(Fig. 5b) peaked significantly earlier for fast detection trials,
compared to slow detection trials (Fig. 5c; two-tailed t-test;
t(28) ¼ 4.03, P ¼ 4.93 � 10 � 4), indicating that the preplay signal
might indeed be relevant for facilitating the detection of
upcoming events. A control analysis showed that differences
between fast and slow detection trials were specific to the
spatial location of the last dot, ruling out the possibility that
the results were influenced by general factors like attentional
fluctuations (Supplementary Fig. 1).

 Relationship between preplay and illusory motion. Previous
studies have reported elevated activity in the primary visual
cortex during apparent motion13–16, with a BOLD peak that is
usually rather late compared to the stimulus onset and that
appears temporally delayed compared to activity elicited by real
motion (for example, see Fig. 4 in ref. 13). This is in line with the
proposal that illusory motion can be understood as a post-dictive
perceptual phenomenon17,18, in which the motion percept along
the apparent motion trajectory is constructed after the stimuli
have been presented. It has been further reported that perception
of illusory motion is abolished when the fixation point falls on the
apparent motion path, potentially because of the less precise
representation of stimuli in the periphery. In contrast, predictive
preplay effects would be expected to remain intact when stimuli
are presented near fixation, as anticipatory activity is also elicited
for foveated stimuli19,20.
To compare the anticipatory BOLD activity that we found
during preplay with apparent motion, we performed a control
experiment in which the first and last dots were presented
alternating at 2.3 Hz for a duration of 6 s (see Methods section
and Supplementary Fig. 7). This induces a percept of illusory
motion between the two dot locations and has been associated
with V1 activity along the path of illusory motion13. The apparent
motion experiment contained two conditions in which the
illusory motion would either pass through or above fixation.
V1 BOLD amplitude at the unstimulated apparent motion path
peaked at 10s and was significantly different from baseline activity
when the illusory motion path was above fixation (non-parametric
t-test with 10,000 permutations; t(3)¼ 13.66, P ¼ 8.49� 10� 4;
BF10¼ 36.04),
but
not
when
it

through
fixation
(non-parametric
t-test
with
10,000 permutations;
t(3)¼ 0.50,
P ¼ 0.65; BF01¼ 2.12). Directly comparing the BOLD activity
above fixation and through fixation revealed a significant difference
(non-parametric t-test with 10,000 permutations; t(3)¼ 13.56,
P ¼ 8.68� 10� 4; BF10¼ 35.51). Importantly, BOLD amplitude
at the unstimulated dot locations during preplay through fixation
was significantly higher than baseline (non-parametric t-test
with 10,000 permutations; t(3)¼ 4.15, P ¼ 0.03; BF10¼ 3.76).
Discussion
Our data provide evidence for sequential activation of V1
receptive fields in response to a starting point in the same order
as they appear during actual stimulation. The preplayed activity
wave was temporally compressed compared to the activity wave
observed during stimulation, suggesting that the preplayed
activity wave reflects anticipation of future stimulus events,
rather than perceptual surprise about unexpected omission of
input19,21, as the latter should occur only later in time. These
results are in line with previous studies showing that memory
reactivation in the hippocampus is often time-compressed12,22,23,
albeit the exact compression factor can vary8.
Importantly, the fact that the activity wave remained present
even when attention was diverted from the stimulus sequence

 suggests that preplay does not strongly depend on the attentional
state, but may rather reflect an automatic prediction process. This
observation is consistent with the presence of preplay-like activity
also in mildly anaesthetized rats7.
Our results are based on fMRI measurements and therefore
reflect haemodynamic effects. Although it has been claimed that
anticipation can entrain haemodynamic responses without any
corresponding
neuronal
activity24,
this
claim
has
proven
questionable25. Moreover, waves of spiking activity have been
observed in awake rats in anticipation of a moving dot7.
Therefore,
it
appears
plausible
that
our
effects
reflect
modulations of neuronal activity.
Crucially, in terms of functionality, the preplay of anticipated
stimulus events that we observed in this study was associated with
facilitated detection of the delayed stimulus sequence, suggestive
of
a
link
between
preplay
and
participants’
behavioural
performance. An interesting question for future studies is
whether preplay effectively improves the accuracy of detecting
relevant stimuli along the preplayed trajectory or simply enhances
the detectability of stimuli (including false positives). This could,
for example, be tested by presenting only the first dot of the
sequence and ask participants to perform a detection task along
the preplay trajectory.
The amplitude of the preplay effect in V1 and the heightened
activity in hMT þ could possibly indicate a perceptual phenom-
enon, similar to what is observed during visual imagery26 or
illusory motion13,14,16,27,28. Indeed, a sizable proportion of the
participants reported seeing something resembling a stripe after
being exposed to only the starting location of an anticipated dot
sequence. This suggests that strong anticipation of perceptual
events may lead to heightened activation of relevant stimuli and
stimulus locations, sometimes resulting in the misperception
(sometimes called hallucination) of the corresponding visual
events29,30. It is important however to note that imagery is an
unlikely explanation for the preplay effect that was reported here.
If imagery is understood as a deliberate process of recreating
a visual percept31, then it would be expected to be stronger
when this process serves the participant (attended condition; task
on the sequence) than when the participant is absorbed by
a different task at fixation (unattended condition). Although the
demanding fixation task may not fully abolish the effect of
imagery, it would nevertheless be expected to be attenuated. In
contrast, our data show that although drawing attention away
from the dots led to a general activity reduction, preplay was of
equal magnitude during both tasks (Fig. 1).
The BOLD activity spread during preplay is reminiscent of what
has been found during motion-inducing illusions15,16,28,32,33,
for
example,
during
apparent
motion
when
stimuli
are
successively presented at different locations13,14. Does the preplay
activity and the activity found during apparent motion reflect
a similar neuronal mechanism? Kolers and Grunau34 showed in
a behavioural experiment that illusory motion perception strongly
depends on the distance from fixation, such that distant stimuli
elicit the strongest illusory motion, and the illusory motion almost
fully disappears when the stimulus path crosses through fixation34.
These behavioural findings correspond to our apparent motion
experiment that revealed elevated hMT þ activity and V1 activity
along the apparent motion path when the stimuli were presented
away from fixation, possibly reflecting the perception of illusory
motion13, but not when the motion path crossed through fixation.
In contrast, the preplay effect remained present when the stimulus
sequence passed through fixation.
Another difference between preplay and apparent motion may
be its time course. The BOLD time course of the V1 activity along
the unstimulated apparent motion path revealed a slowly rising
signal, peaking after 10 s. In contrast, the time course of the
preplay activity was found to be temporally compressed,
and occurred in anticipation of the sensory stimulation. These
differences suggest a distinction between these phenomena,
in which the apparent motion signal corresponds to a visual
illusion that occurs more likely in the visual periphery with
sparser receptive field coverage, and builds up slowly over
time, rather than a predictive process (although it has been
shown that apparent motion activity can be modulated by
stimulus expectation14).
Perception depends on both the current sensory input and on
previous
experience35.
Pattern
completion,
the
experience-
dependent
ability
to
recreate
an
event
based
on
partial
information, was previously attributed to higher brain areas
such as the hippocampus36–38. Our results extend these findings
by showing that this mechanism could be partly supported by
reinstating the full stimulus sequence in V1 of early visual cortex.
Thus, the notion of preplay processes in the visual system blurs
the boundaries between memory and perception39,40, and
underscores the integrated nature of these two cognitive faculties.
Methods
Participants. Thirty-three right-handed participants were recruited from the
student population at the Radboud University in Nijmegen. Sample size was
decided on before the collection of data and was aimed at being able to detect
experimental effects that had at least moderate effect size (Cohen’s d40.6).
Participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the institutional
guidelines of the local ethical committee (CMO region Arnhem-Nijmegen, The
Netherlands) and received monetary compensation for their participation. All
participants were invited for two separate scanning sessions taking place within
maximally 2 weeks’ time. Three participants completed only one of the two
sessions and 1 participant was excluded due to excessive head motion. Only the
remaining 29 participants (19 female, mean age ¼ 23 years) were included in all
analyses. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity.
Four additional participants (1 female, mean age ¼ 28 years) participated in
a control experiment.
MRI acquisition. Functional and anatomical images were acquired using a 3T
Skyra MRI system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a 32-channel
headcoil. Each of two MRI sessions lasted between 1.5 and 2.5 h, during which we
acquired (i) a T1-weighted anatomical scan (1 mm isotropic), (ii) two whole-brain
functional localizer runs during the behavioural training of the stimulus sequence
(2 mm isotropic; TR ¼ 1,800 ms). These runs were used for an online analysis at the
MRI scanner console to aid the slice positioning of the ultra-fast functional runs,
(iii) eight ultra-fast functional runs to measure BOLD activity during the
experimental paradigm (2 mm isotropic; TR ¼ 88 ms), where four runs consisted of
the left-right and right-left stimulus sequence, respectively. After four runs,
participants were trained with the opposite sequence. The order of left-right and
right-left sequences was randomized across sessions and participants. Functional
slices were positioned based on an anatomical landmark (along the calcarine
sulcus) and based on a functional localizer (stimulus versus rest) that was acquired
during training. (iv) Three to four functional runs with a moving bar sequence, to
estimate pRFs9. In one session, participants performed a task on the dot sequence
(attended condition), and in the second session participants performed a task at
fixation (unattended condition). The order of sessions was randomized across
participants. The retinotopic mapping was only performed once, either during the
first or during the second session.
BOLD activity for the localizer runs and the retinotopic mapping was measured
using T2*-weighted gradient echo planar imaging sequence (TR/echo time
(TE) ¼ 1,800/30 ms, 26 transversal slices, voxel size 2 � 2 � 1.7 mm, 60� flip angle;
slice gap ¼ 20%). BOLD activity for the experimental runs was measured using a
standard T2*-weighted gradient echo planar imaging sequence (TR/TE ¼ 88/25 ms,
2 transversal slices, voxel size 2.3 � 2.3 � 4.0 mm, 60� flip angle; slice gap ¼ 10%).
Notably, the fast TR was possible because only 2 slices were acquired that were
carefully positioned to cover the relevant parts of primary visual cortex
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Anatomical images were acquired with a T1-weighted
magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence (TR/
TE ¼ 2,300/3.03 ms, voxel size 1 � 1 � 1 mm, 8� flip angle). BOLD measurements
in the control experiment used a multiband sequence (acceleration factor ¼ 3; TR/
TE ¼ 262/35.80 ms, 9 transversal slices, voxel size 2.4 � 2.4 � 2.4 mm, 38� flip
angle; slice gap ¼ 20%).
Visual stimuli. Stimuli were rear projected on a screen located 80.5 cm from the
participant’s eyes at the head of the scanner table. The screen was viewed using
a mirror attached to the headcoil. We presented a moving dot sequence consisting

 y ¼ þ 2� above fixation on a black background. Each dot had a diameter of
1.2� and was shown for 100 ms followed by a blank screen of 33 ms. The total
duration of the moving dot sequence amounts to 502 ms. A fixation cross (0.6�)
was shown at the centre of the screen and participants were instructed to maintain
fixation throughout the experiment.
Experimental design. The experiment consisted of four parts. First, participants
were shown 108 trials of either the dot sequence left-to-right or right-to-left. The
sequences were presented in six blocks of 36 s and each trial lasted 2 s. The blocks
were followed by a 36 s rest period, only displaying the fixation cross. This exposure
period served to familiarize participants with the dot sequence and was further
used to compute an online t-contrast (stimulation4fixation) at the MR console to
aid the slice positioning of the following ultra-fast sequence. During this part
only the full stimulus sequences were shown and no starting-point-only or
end-point-only trials. During the exposure period participants performed the same
task as during the main experiment, detecting letters at fixation (unattended
condition) or performing a task on the dot (attended condition).
Second, there followed four runs with the ultra-fast fMRI sequence. Two slices
were positioned in the sagittal axis with alignment along the calcarine sulcus, the
anatomical location of V1, and adjusted, if necessary, to cover as much as possible of
the online t-contrast map. Each run contained 24 trials, consisting of 10 stimulus
sequence trials that matched the previous exposure period (that is, either left-to-right
or right-to-left), 5 preplay trials with a presentation of the starting dot only,
5 control trials with a presentation of the end dot only and 4 stimulus sequence
‘oddball’ trials where the last dot was shown after 167 ms instead of 33ms. The order
of stimulus conditions was pseudo-randomized for a given run with the restriction
that the first trial of a run was always a full sequence trial, and preplay and control
trials were always preceded and followed by a full sequence trial. Each trial lasted
11.97s (corresponding to 136 fMRI volumes), consisting of a 502 ms stimulus
sequence (638ms for the oddball trials) and 11.47s ITI. The long ITI duration was
chosen to provide time for the BOLD response to return back to baseline. Each run
lasted 4.8min and started with 8 s of fixation that was discarded from the analysis.
Third, participants were shown 108 trials of the other dot sequence, that is,
left-to-right if the previous sequence was right-to-left and vice versa. Which
sequence was shown first was randomly chosen and counterbalanced across
participants. Fourth, after exposure with the new stimulus sequence, participants
underwent four runs with the ultra-fast sequence again with the same parameters
as described above. In total, the functional experiment lasted 45 min and contained
80 stimulation trials (10,880 volumes), 40 preplay trials and 40 control trials
(5,440 volumes, respectively).
Each participant performed the experiment twice in separate sessions, at least
2 days, but no longer than 14 days apart. In one session (attended condition)
participants had to detect rare occasions (20%), when the last dot of the sequence
followed slightly later (167 ms) after the previous dot than expected (33 ms). In the
other session (unattended condition), participants were presented with a sequence
of rapidly changing letters at fixation and had to report whenever target letters
‘X’ or ‘Y’ (target probability ¼ 10%) appeared in a stream of non-target letters
(‘A’, ‘T’, ‘N’, ‘U’, ‘V’, ‘Y’, ‘H’ and ‘R’). Letters were presented for 400 ms each,
separated by 400 ms intervals in which only the fixation point was presented. Apart
from the different tasks, the two sessions were identical. The order of sessions was
counterbalanced across participants. In a post-experimental interview participants
were asked whether they perceived a ‘stripe’ after being exposed to only the starting
location of the dot sequence (attended condition: 38%; unattended condition: 28%).
A control experiment was conducted to rule out carry-over effects of the BOLD
signal from one trial to the next and to test whether the preplay still persists when
the stimulus sequence moves through fixation (Supplementary Fig. 7). Stimuli and
timing in the control experiment were virtually identical to the main experiment.
Changes were as follows: (i) instead of a fixed ITI of 11.47 s, a variable ITI ranging
from 11.79 to 15.98 s was used and each block contained three null events of 10.22 s
in which only a fixation cross was displayed. The null events occurred at random
positions throughout the block; (ii) we presented the moving dot sequence
consisting of four dots at spatial locations evenly spaced between x ¼ � 8� and
þ 8� and y ¼ 0�, moving through fixation; (iii) instead of the letter task,
participants had to detect a dimming of the fixation cross (reduction of stimulus
contrast by 30%). The dimming occurred at random locations in time, on average
once per trial.
Participants were exposed to the stimulus sequence for 108 trials. Directly after
that two blocks with the left-to-right sequence were shown. Each block consisted of
20 trials in which the full stimulus sequence was shown, and 10 preplay trials with
the starting point only. The end-point trials were left out to keep the scanning time
to a minimum.
In addition, four blocks with an apparent motion paradigm were shown in
which two dots were presented alternating at 2.3 Hz. Stimulus duration was 150 ms
with an inter-stimulus interval of 67 ms. The timing was based on a previous study
by Muckli et al.13. The stimuli were shown for 6 s followed by a variable ITI
ranging from 11.79 to 15.98 s. The dots were presented at x ¼ � 8� and þ 8�,
respectively. In two blocks, the dots were shown at y ¼ 6� and in the remaining two
blocks the dots were shown at y ¼ 0�, with the apparent motion path going through
fixation. Each block consisted of 20 trials with the flickering apparent motion
stimulus sequence, and 10 trials in which only the starting point was shown. The
latter condition was used to test whether the starting point of the apparent motion
paradigm would also elicit an anticipatory BOLD activity wave.
pRF estimation. The data from the moving bar runs were used to estimate the pRF
of each voxel in the functional volumes using MrVista (http://white.stanford.edu/
software). In this analysis, a predicted BOLD signal is calculated from the known
stimulus parameters and a model of the underlying neuronal population. The
model of the neuronal population consisted of a two-dimensional Gaussian pRF,
with parameters x0, y0 and s, where x0 and y0 are the coordinates of the centre of
the receptive field, and s indicates its spread (s.d.) or size. All parameters were
stimulus-referred and their units were degrees of visual angle. These parameters
were adjusted to obtain the best possible fit of the predicted to the actual BOLD
signal. This method has been shown to produce pRF size estimates that agree well
with electrophysiological receptive field measurements in monkey and human
visual cortex. For details of this procedure, see refs 9,41. Once estimated, x0 and
y0 were converted to eccentricity and polar-angle measures and co-registered with
the functional images using linear transformation. For the following analyses, only
voxels with a model fit of R241% were considered. Group-averaged receptive field
properties are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.
Functional localizer. Images of the localizer blocks were preprocessed using FSL42,
including motion correction (six-parameter affine transform), temporal high-pass
filtering (128 s) and spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel (full-width at half
maximum ¼ 5). Onsets and durations of the moving dot exposure blocks were
convolved with a single-gamma haemodynamic response function (HRF) and fitted
using a general linear model. For each subject a two-sided t-contrast was calculated
comparing stimulation and baseline periods. Resulting statistical maps were
thresholded at Po0.001, uncorrected. Significant effects were also tested on
a group-level via random-effects analysis using FSL’s FLAME43 and corrected for
multiple comparisons using cluster correction with FSL’s cluster command
(z ¼ 2.58, cluster significance threshold Po0.05). In the visual cortex this resulted
in separate significant clusters in hMT þ and early visual cortex.
Selection of V1 and hMT þ regions. V1 was determined using the automatic
cortical parcellation provided by FreeSurfer44 based on individual T1 images. The
V1 mask was further restricted to voxels with receptive fields along the moving dot
path. To this end, only voxels with a receptive field centre ranging from y ¼ 1.4� to
2.6�, and x ¼ � 10� to 10� (that is, along the stimulus path) were considered
(Supplementary Fig. 2b). With increasing receptive field size, voxels will respond to
multiple dot locations. To prevent overlap in response profiles the V1 mask was
further restricted to voxels with a pRF size r3.5�.
hMT þ was determined for individual participants as follows. Significant
voxels from the individual contrast (stimulus4baseline) were only considered
when they overlapped with significant voxels in the hMT þ cluster from the
statistical group analysis. This way, individual hMT þ activations were constrained
by the group results.
fMRI preprocessing. Images were preprocessed using FSL (Oxford, UK) including
motion correction (six-parameter affine transform, albeit limited due to low
number of slices), temporal high-pass filtering (128 s) and Savitzky–Golay low-pass
filter45 for each run separately. Individual voxel time courses were then
transformed into per cent signal change in reference to the mean over time.
No spatial smoothing was performed, and all analyses were carried out in the
native subject space.
Next, time courses were temporally averaged over trials and runs separately
for each task condition (stimulus, preplay and control), stimulus sequence
(left-to-right and right-to-left) and sessions (attended and unattended). In the
following analyses only voxels within individual V1 and hMT þ masks were
considered.
Amplitude and peak latency. fMRI response amplitude and peak latency were
computed by fitting a conventional single-gamma HRF function46 to individual
voxel time courses for each participant, task condition, stimulus sequence, session
and each region of interest (ROI). This was done using the function curve_fit as
implemented in SciPy 0.18 (ref. 47; based on the Trust Region Reflective algorithm
for a constrained least-squares fit). The objective function was the sum of squared
errors between the predicted and observed response. We allowed the baseline,
amplitude and peak delay to vary as free parameters. The peak delay was constrained
to a range between 3 and 11.5 s peak latency to prevent pathological fits.
Owing to cortical magnification, the receptive field density is highest around the
fovea and rapidly decreases towards the periphery. As a consequence V1 voxels
have disproportionally more receptive fields close to the fovea, compared to the
periphery (Supplementary Fig. 2a). To give an unbiased estimate of the
propagation of visual activity, we binned the receptive fields into 28, evenly spaced
bins, covering the relevant eccentricities from x ¼ � 12� to þ 12�. Note, the
binning procedure only aids the visualization of the V1 activity wave, but had no
influence on the reported BOLD amplitude and peak latency statistics. Fitted HRFs
were averaged within each bin and resulted for each subject, task condition,

 stimulus sequence and session in a M ¼ N � T matrix, where N is the number of
bins and T is the number of functional volumes (136). For the different stimulus
sequences, that is, left-to-right and right-to-left, matrices M were aligned by
reversing the order of N for the right-to-left sequences (effectively changing it into
a left-to-right sequence) and then averaged. Note that due to missing pRF coverage,
single bins might be empty. Importantly, while averaging these empty bins were
not treated as zero, but as ‘not a number’ (Nan) and the averaging was restricted to
real values (for example, average(5.3 þ 2.1) ¼ 7.4; average(5.3 þ Nan) ¼ 5.3;
average(Nan þ Nan) ¼ Nan). Individual response matrices are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 3. The relationship of BOLD amplitude and BOLD peak delay
was tested using Pearson’s correlation across subjects for the stimulation condition.
Confirming previous reports48,49, no significant relationship was found
(r ¼ � 0.12; P ¼ 0.81).
To what extent does the detection of the reported BOLD delay differences
depend on our ultra-fast scanning sequence? To answer this question, we down-
sampled the existing data and repeated the same analyses (Supplementary Fig. 6).
For the BOLD amplitude and delay analyses, only V1 voxel along the stimulus
path were selected. We additionally used a pRF-based stimulus reconstruction
analysis10,11 based on all voxel in V1 with a pRF size r3.5�, to show the spatial
specificity of the activity spread. To this end, for each condition, the BOLD
amplitude estimates of each voxel were first multiplied with a two-dimensional
Gaussian defined by each voxels’ pRF estimates (x0, y0 and s0) and then averaged
over the voxel dimension, resulting in a stimulus reconstruction. This stimulus
reconstruction was divided by a stimulus reconstruction for which the amplitude
for all voxels was set to 1, effectively reducing the distortion due to the uneven
distribution of receptive fields throughout the visual field. To illustrate the temporal
and spatial dynamics of BOLD activity, we calculated pRF-based stimulus
reconstructions (N ¼ 29) for each time point (Supplementary Movie 1). These
reconstructions were created for the unattended condition. The same pRF-based
stimulus reconstruction analysis was used for the control experiment with apparent
motion stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 7).
BOLD amplitude for hMT þ was calculated using the same fitting procedure,
except that responses were averaged over all hMT þ voxels and no binning was
performed. Correlations between V1 and hMT þ amplitude estimates were
calculated using Pearson’s product–moment correlation across subjects. To this
end, the V1 amplitudes of the stimulation condition were averaged across all four
stimulation locations (that is, dot locations 1–4). For the preplay and control
condition V1 amplitudes were averaged across the non-stimulated dot locations
(that is, dot locations 2, 3 and 4 for preplay and dot locations 1, 2 and 3 for the
control condition). Event-related averages of the BOLD responses are shown in
Fig. 2. Resulting correlation coefficients were transformed to Fisher z values and
tested for significance from zero using one sample t-tests (non-parametric
permutation test with 10,000 permutations).
Granger correlation of hMT þ and V1. We used a Granger ‘causality’ analysis,
hereby referred to as Granger correlation (GC) analysis to probe the ‘directionality’
of the correlation between hMT þ and V1. GC was calculated in terms of vector
autoregressive models in the frequency domain 0.0078–0.25 Hz (that is, the
available frequency spectrum of the BOLD signal after temporal filtering). The
influence measures FhMT þ -V1, FV1-hMT þ and FhMT þ � V1 were computed from
the average time course of all voxels in hMT þ and V1 for the stimulation and
preplay condition, respectively. As suggested by Roebroeck et al.50 we assessed
GC as the difference of the influence terms (FhMT-V1 and FV1-hMT). The null
hypothesis is FhMT þ -V1 � FV1-hMT þ ¼ 0. The order of the autoregressive model
was set to p ¼ 1 according to Roebroeck et al.50.
Within the GC framework, a difference value o0 can be interpreted as ‘hMT þ
is driving V1’, and a difference value 40 can be interpreted in the opposite
direction, that is, that ‘V1 is driving hMT þ ’. GC difference scores were tested
against zero using a two-sided one-sample t-test (Supplementary Fig. 8).
RT analysis. On the basis of a median split, for each participant, delayed sequence
trials were divided into fast versus slow RT trials. BOLD time courses of voxels
corresponding to the retinotopically defined location of the last dot in the stimulus
sequence were averaged and fitted with a HRF for each participant and slow versus
fast RT trials separately. Estimated BOLD peak latency differences were tested
across participants with a paired-sample t-test.
Control for eye movements. Participants were instructed to maintain fixation
throughout the whole experiment. Eye positions were recorded with a video camera
at 50 Hz sampling rate under infrared illumination (MEye Track-LR camera unit,
SMI, SensoMotoric Instruments). Eyeblink artefacts were identified by differ-
entiating the signal to detect eye pupil changes occurring too rapidly (o60 ms) to
represent actual dilation. Blinks and samples in which the corneal reflection was
not reliably detected were removed from the signal using linear interpolation.
Eyetracking data gathered in the scanner for 22 of the 29 participants during the
attended session and for 21 of the 29 participants for the unattended session. We
calculated the mean gaze as a function of the four stimulus locations and task
conditions. Mean horizontal gaze position did not vary with stimulus position for
the scanning session with ‘task on stimulus’ (attended condition; ANOVA,
P ¼ 0.58; N ¼ 22) and for the scanning session with ‘task at fixation’ (unattended
condition; (ANOVA, P ¼ 0.33; N ¼ 21).
