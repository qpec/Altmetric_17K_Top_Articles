On August 2, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause congenital 
microcephaly and brain abnormalities (1,2). Since 2015, Zika 
virus has been spreading through much of the World Health 
Organization’s Region of the Americas, including U.S. territories. 
Zika virus is spread through the bite of Aedes aegypti or Aedes 
albopictus mosquitoes, by sex with an infected partner, or from a 
pregnant woman to her fetus during pregnancy.* CDC estimates 
that 41 states are in the potential range of Aedes aegypti or Aedes 
albopictus mosquitoes (3), and on July 29, 2016, the Florida 
Department of Health identified an area in one neighborhood 
of Miami where Zika virus infections in multiple persons are 
being spread by bites of local mosquitoes. These are the first 
known cases of local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission in 
the continental United States.† CDC prevention efforts include 
mosquito surveillance and control, targeted education about 
Zika virus and condom use to prevent sexual transmission, and 
guidance for providers on contraceptive counseling to reduce 
unintended pregnancy. To estimate the prevalence of contracep-
tive use among nonpregnant and postpartum women at risk for 
unintended pregnancy and sexually active female high school stu-
dents living in the 41 states where mosquito-borne transmission 
might be possible, CDC used 2011–2013 and 2015 survey data 
from four state-based surveillance systems: the Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS, 2011–2013), which sur-
veys adult women; the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring 
System (PRAMS, 2013) and the Maternal and Infant Health 
Assessment (MIHA, 2013), which surveys women with a recent 
live birth; and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS, 2015), 
which surveys students in grades 9–12. CDC defines an unin-
tended pregnancy as one that is either unwanted (i.e., the preg-
nancy occurred when no children, or no more children, were 
desired) or mistimed (i.e., the pregnancy occurred earlier than 
desired). The proportion of women at risk for unintended preg-
nancy who used a highly effective reversible method, known as 
long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), ranged from 5.5% 
to 18.9% for BRFSS-surveyed women and 6.9% to 30.5% for 
PRAMS/MIHA–surveyed women. The proportion of women 
not using any contraception ranged from 12.3% to 34.3% 
(BRFSS) and from 3.5% to 15.3% (PRAMS/MIHA). YRBS 
data indicated that among sexually active female high school 
students, use of LARC at last intercourse ranged from 1.7% to 
8.4%, and use of no contraception ranged from 7.3% to 22.8%. 
In the context of Zika preparedness, the full range of contracep-
tive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA), including LARC, should be readily available and acces-
sible for women who want to avoid or delay pregnancy. Given 
low rates of LARC use, states can implement strategies to remove 
barriers to the access and availability of LARC including high 
device costs, limited provider reimbursement, lack of training 
for providers serving women and adolescents on insertion and 
removal of LARC, provider lack of knowledge and mispercep-
tions about LARC, limited availability of youth-friendly services 
that address adolescent confidentiality concerns, inadequate 
client-centered counseling, and low consumer awareness of the 
range of contraceptive methods available.
BRFSS is a cross-sectional, random-digit–dialed, state-based 
telephone survey that collects data on risk behaviors and pre-
ventive health practices among adult respondents living in all 
50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands.§ Data from 17 states that might be 
at risk for mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus (3) and 
had implemented questions on self-reported contraceptive use 
as part of the BRFSS Family Planning module in 2011 or as 
state-added questions in 2012 or 2013 were used to estimate 
use of contraception among women aged 18–44 years at risk 
for unintended pregnancy.¶ PRAMS is an ongoing state-based 
and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor 
selected self-reported maternal behaviors and experiences that 
occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who 
recently delivered a live-born infant.** Data from 28 PRAMS

¶ For BRFSS, women were considered at risk for unintended pregnancy if 
they were not currently pregnant, were sexually active (not abstinent), and, 
the last time they had sex, had not had a hysterectomy, did not have a same-
sex partner, and did not want a pregnancy.

states, reporting in 2013, were used to estimate contraceptive 
use at the time of the survey (4–6 months postpartum) among 
women aged 15–44 years with a recent live birth who were at 
risk for unintended pregnancy.†† PRAMS sites were included if 
they might be at risk for mosquito-borne transmission of Zika 
virus (3) and achieved a weighted response rate of ≥55%.§§ 
The 2013 MIHA was used to estimate contraceptive use for 
postpartum women in California. Using methods comparable 
to PRAMS, MIHA is an annual, statewide-representative sur-
vey of women with a recent live birth.¶¶ YRBSs are conducted 
by state health and education agencies among representative 
samples of students in grades 9–12, to monitor health-risk 
behaviors, including sexual behaviors related to unintended 
pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.*** Data from 
2015 YRBSs conducted in 28 states that might be at risk for 
mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus (3) were used to 
describe contraceptive use among female high school students 
at last sexual intercourse.†††
For all data sources, contraceptive use was classified 
according to the estimated percentage of users who experi-
ence pregnancy during the first year of typical use as highly 
effective (<1%), moderately effective (6%–10%), and less 
effective (>10%) (4). Among women reporting more than 
one contraceptive method, the most effective method was 
coded. Highly effective, permanent contraceptive methods 
included female sterilization, tubal ligation, or partner vasec-
tomy. Highly effective LARC methods included intrauterine 
devices (IUDs) and contraceptive implants. Moderately 
effective contraceptive methods included hormone injec-
tions, contraceptive pills, transdermal contraceptive patches, 
and vaginal rings. Less effective methods included dia-
phragm, condoms (male or female), cervical cap, sponge, 
withdrawal, spermicide, fertility-based awareness methods, 
emergency contraception, and “other.” Data for the use of 
permanent contraceptive methods, although included in the 
denominator for calculating percentages, are not presented 
because women reporting female sterilization or partner 
vasectomy do not need ongoing contraceptive services.§§§
Weighted prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals 
for contraceptive use were calculated overall and by age group, 
as appropriate (BRFSS: ages 18–24, 25–34, and 35–44 years; 
PRAMS/MIHA: ages 15–19, 20–24, 25–34, and 35–44 years) 
and by race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white [white], non-
Hispanic black [black], and Hispanic). For all surveys, non-
Hispanic other race was included in the denominator, but not 
presented because of small sample sizes. PRAMS/MIHA data 
were used to estimate the prevalence of contraceptive use by 
insurance status (private insurance, Medicaid, and none)¶¶¶; 
other insurance was not presented because of small sample 
sizes. Estimates were excluded when they did not meet the 
reliability standard established for each surveillance system.****
In the 17 states for which BRFSS data were available, 
use of LARC at last sexual intercourse among women aged 
18–44 years at risk for unintended pregnancy ranged from 
5.5% (Arizona) to 18.9% (Utah) (Table 1). The proportion 
of women at risk for unintended pregnancy who used no 
contraception was lowest in Vermont (12.3%) and highest in 
Tennessee (34.3%). For all states, moderately and less effective 
contraception use was lower among older women (available at 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/40511). Use of less effective 
contraception was more common among Hispanic women 
than among white women (available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/40511).
PRAMS and MIHA data indicated that the proportion of 
women aged 15–44 years at risk for unintended pregnancy 
using LARC during the postpartum period ranged from 
6.9% (New Jersey) to 30.5% (Utah) (Table 2) and was typi-
cally highest among adolescents aged 15–19 years (available 
at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/40512). The proportion 
of postpartum women at risk for unintended pregnancy who 
did not use contraception ranged from 3.5% (Vermont) to 
15.3% (Hawaii). In general, use of LARC and moderately 
effective contraception was lower in older women (available 
at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/40512). The proportion of 
women using less effective contraceptive methods tended to be 
higher among white and Hispanic women than black women 
(available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/40512). Among 
 †† For PRAMS, women were considered at risk for unintended pregnancy if 
they were not currently pregnant, did not want a pregnancy, were sexually 
active (not abstinent), and did not report another reason they could not get 
pregnant (i.e., had a same-sex partner, had a hysterectomy/oopherectomy, 
or were infertile).
 §§ PRAMS uses a minimum 60% response rate for publication. However, based 
on the critical need to report surveillance data related to Zika virus, PRAMS 
provided permission to use a lower response rate threshold.
 ¶¶ MIHA uses the same definition of unintended pregnancy as PRAMS.
 *** http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/methods.htm.
 ††† Female high school students were considered currently sexually active if they 
had sexual intercourse with at least one person during the 3 months before 
the survey. In 2015, 30.1% of female high school students nationwide were 
currently sexually active. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/ss/
ss6506a1.htm.
 §§§ In BRFSS, use of highly effective, permanent contraception ranged from 
11.7% to 29.4%; in PRAMS use of highly effective, permanent 
contraception ranged from 7.5% to 18.8%. YRBSs do not collect 
information on highly effective, permanent methods of contraception.
 ¶¶¶ Insurance status was reported at the time of survey, between 4 and 6 months 
postpartum.
 **** BRFSS data were excluded if unweighted denominators had <50 
respondents or a relative standard error >30%. PRAMS and MIHA data 
were suppressed if unweighted denominators had <30 respondents; 
estimates based on <60 respondents were flagged and should be interpreted 
with caution. YRBS data were suppressed if there were <100 respondents.

women with no insurance, use of LARC ranged from 5.3% 
(New Jersey) to 34.2% (Utah) (available at https://stacks.cdc.
gov/view/cdc/40513).
YRBS data indicated that among currently sexually active 
female high school students in 28 states, LARC use ranged from 
<2% (North Carolina and Pennsylvania) to 8.4% (Vermont) 
(Table 3). Use of less effective contraceptive methods ranged 
from 36.3% (Vermont) to 59.9% (Florida); the proportion 
of sexually active female high school students not using any 
contraception was lowest in Vermont (7.3%) and highest in 
Arkansas (22.8%). Limited data were available to describe sexu-
ally active female high school students using contraception by 
method effectiveness and race/ethnicity (available at https://
stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/40514).
Discussion
During 2011–2013 and 2015, nonpregnant and postpartum 
women at risk for unintended pregnancy, and sexually active 
female high school students in states that might be at risk for 
mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus, used moderately 
effective and less effective contraceptive methods most fre-
quently; use of no contraception varied among states. LARC 
was used by fewer than one fourth of nonpregnant women, 
approximately one third of women who recently delivered a 
live birth, and fewer than one tenth of sexually active female 
high school students. LARC use also varied by state, age 
group, race/ethnicity, and insurance status. Increasing acces-
sibility of contraceptive services, including LARC, can reduce 
unintended pregnancy, including the number of pregnancies 
affected by Zika virus infection among women who are return-
ing, or whose partners are returning, from areas with ongoing 
Zika virus transmission (5).
Despite the availability of a wide range of FDA-approved 
contraceptives, unintended pregnancy remains common in the 
United States; the most recent estimates indicate that 45% of 
all pregnancies are unintended (6), with variation across states 
(7) and by age group, income, education, and race/ethnicity 
(6). LARC methods are highly effective, reversible methods 
for reducing unintended pregnancy, do not depend on user 
compliance, and are medically appropriate for most female

adolescents and adult women (4,8). Nationally, although use of 
LARC methods nearly doubled in recent years (9), use remains 
lower than that of other reversible contraceptives such as oral 
contraceptive pills and condoms (9), and considerable barriers 
to access and contraceptive method availability remain (10).
The most recent estimates for the United States suggest that 
lower income women had rates of unintended pregnancy up to 
five times higher than women with higher incomes (6). During 
2000–2010, the need for publicly funded contraceptive services 
increased 17% (11).†††† Although publicly funded providers 
met approximately 42% of contraceptive need in 2013, unmet 
need varied by state, suggesting gaps in access to subsidized 
contraceptive care (11). Among low income women with 
Medicaid insurance, recent guidance emphasizes provision of 
contraceptive services without cost-sharing.§§§§ Also, whereas 
women with private insurance coverage reported decreased 
out-of-pocket costs for LARC following the 2012 Affordable 
Care Act requirement for most private health plans to cover 
contraceptive services, 13% of women continued to cost-share 
(12), further highlighting differences in access and availability 
(13). Although federal regulations for publicly funded coverage 
enable minors to obtain contraceptive care without parental

 * Women using permanent contraception were included in the denominator for all estimates.
 † Women were considered at risk for unintended pregnancy if they were not currently pregnant, did not want a pregnancy, were sexually active (not abstinent), and 
did not report another reason they could not get pregnant (i.e., had a same-sex partner, had a hysterectomy/oopherectomy, or were infertile).
 § MIHA is an annual population-based survey of California resident women with a live birth, with a sample size of 7,010 in 2013. Prevalence and 95% confidence 
intervals are weighted to represent all women with a live birth in California in 2013.
 ¶ Highly effective, reversible contraceptive methods or LARC include intrauterine devices and implants. 
 ** Moderately effective contraceptive methods include hormone injections, contraceptive pills, transdermal contraceptive patch, and vaginal ring.
 †† Less effective contraceptive methods include diaphragm, condoms (male or female), cervical cap, sponge, withdrawal, spermicide, fertility-based awareness 
methods, emergency contraception, and “other.” Respondents answering “other” were given the opportunity to write in a response, which was evaluated and 
reclassified into existing contraceptive method options as appropriate. 
 
§§ Does not include New York City.
 †††† Need is defined as sexually active women with a family income below 250% 
of the federal poverty level and all women younger than age 20 years, who 
are able to conceive and were not intentionally trying to get pregnant.

consent, private insurers often follow state laws, which vary by 
jurisdiction, potentially limiting access (14). To improve access 
and availability to the full range of contraception, a number 
of state-level and jurisdictional-level strategies exist and could 
be adopted by state and local agencies (Box).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, information on contraceptive use was self-reported 
and might be subject to recall or social desirability bias, and 
response rates varied by state and surveillance system.¶¶¶¶ 
Second, consistent and correct use of contraception affects 
effectiveness rates, and this was not measured. Third, popula-
tion estimates are generalizable only to specific populations 
for which data are collected; for example, estimates among 
sexually active female high school students are not generalizable 
to adolescents who do not attend school. Fourth, the current 
contraceptive use profile in states might have changed since 
the data were collected. Finally, only 39 of the 41 states had 
data from at least one surveillance system, highlighting the 
need for ongoing collection of state-level data on contracep-
tive use (3).*****
State-level strategies for increasing access to the full range 
of FDA-approved contraceptive methods and related services 
can reduce unintended pregnancies among women, includ-
ing women who might be exposed to Zika virus. CDC 
supports states in 1) implementing vector control strategies; 
 ¶¶¶¶ BRFSS response rates vary by state (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_
data/2013/pdf/2013_dqr.pdf). PRAMS/MIHA response rates vary by state, 
but must meet the minimum 55% response threshold to be included; however, 
the typical minimum response threshold for PRAMS/MIHA is 65% (http://
www.cdc.gov/prams/methodology.htm). YRBS response rates vary by state 
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6201a1.htm).

2) identifying, diagnosing, and clinically managing infection 
and exposure among pregnant women; and 3) increasing 
information about effective contraception to avoid unintended 
pregnancy (15). Prevention efforts for all women and men of 
reproductive age include targeted education about Zika virus 
and its transmission, condom use to avoid sexual transmission 
to pregnant women, and contraceptive counseling for women 
who want to delay or avoid pregnancy (15). Because contracep-
tion is the primary means to prevent unintended pregnancy 
for women at risk for Zika virus infection, sexually active 
nonpregnant women of reproductive age and their sex partners 
need to have access to all approved contraceptive methods, 
and these methods need to be readily available and accessible.

Summary 
What is already known on this topic?
Zika virus is transmitted through the bite of an Aedes species 
mosquito, sex with an infected partner, or from a pregnant 
woman to her fetus. Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a 
cause of congenital microcephaly and other severe fetal brain 
defects. It has also been associated with eye defects, hearing 
loss, and impaired growth. Nearly half of all pregnancies in the 
United States are unintended. Among nonpermanent contra-
ceptive methods, long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is 
the most effective contraceptive option for preventing unin-
tended pregnancy.
What is added by this report?
State-based estimates of contraception use are provided for 
nonpregnant and postpartum women at risk for unintended 
pregnancy and sexually active female high school students. 
Among these populations, use of moderate and less effective 
contraception was most common; use of no contraceptive method 
and use of LARC varied by state, age group, and race/ethnicity.
What are the implications for public health practice?
State and local strategies are needed to increase access to 
contraceptive methods and related services, reduce the risk for 
unintended pregnancy, and minimize the number of pregnan-
cies affected by Zika infection. Potentially effective strategies 
include addressing policies on high device costs and provider 
reimbursement, comprehensive provider training on insertion 
and removal of LARC, provision of youth-friendly services, 
support to resource-challenged jurisdictions, client-centered 
counseling and assessment of patient satisfaction, and 
increased consumer awareness of the full range of contracep-
tive methods to delay or avoid pregnancy.
