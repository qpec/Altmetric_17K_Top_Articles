Extravascular lung water (EVLW) is a key variable in heart failure management and prognosis, but its objective assessment remains elusive. Lung
imaging has been traditionally considered off-limits for ultrasound techniques due to the acoustic barrier of high-impedance air wall. In pulmon-
ary congestion however, the presence of both air and water creates a peculiar echo fingerprint. Lung ultrasound shows B-lines, comet-like
signals arising from a hyper-echoic pleural line with a to-and-fro movement synchronized with respiration. Increasing EVLW accumulation
changes the normal, no-echo signal (black lung, no EVLW) into a black-and-white pattern (interstitial sub-pleural oedema with multiple B-lines)
or a white lung pattern (alveolar pulmonary oedema) with coalescing B-lines. The number and spatial extent of B-lines on the antero-lateral
chest allows a semi-quantitative estimation of EVLW (from absent, ≤5, to severe pulmonary oedema, .30 B-lines). Wet B-lines are made by
water and decreased by diuretics, which cannot modify dry B-lines made by connective tissue. B-lines can be evaluated anywhere (including
extreme environmental conditions with pocket size instruments to detect high-altitude pulmonary oedema), anytime (during dialysis to titrate
intervention), by anyone (even a novice sonographer after 1 h training), and on anybody (since the chest acoustic window usually remains pa-
tent when echocardiography is not feasible). Cardiologists can achieve much diagnostic gain with little investment of technology, training, and
time. B-lines represent ‘the shape of lung water’. They allow non-invasive detection, in real time, of even sub-clinical forms of pulmonary oedema
with a low cost, radiation-free approach.

B-lines for imaging pulmonary
congestion
Pulmonary congestion is an almost universal finding in patients with
acute heart failure. It may be related to heterogeneous mechanisms
such as fluid retention with weight gain in patients with reduced
ejection fraction and/or fluid redistribution to the lungs, usually
without weight variation, in patients with preserved ejection frac-
tion and a noncompliant cardiovascular system.1 Clinical symptoms
and signs of pulmonary congestion resulting in interstitial and alveo-
lar oedema are a late event in acute heart failure syndrome. The
identification of pulmonary congestion with a reliable and objective
non-invasive imaging biomarker would confer a pathophysiological,
diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic advantage to the clinical car-
diologist.1 In patients with impending acute heart failure syndrome,
there is often a relatively long incubation period, of days and weeks,
during which there is a gradual accumulation of extravascular lung
water (EVLW), a term used to describe water within the lungs
but outside pulmonary vasculature. Detection and treatment of pul-
monary congestion before it is clinically evident can prevent hospi-
talization and progression of heart failure. Post-discharge freedom
from pulmonary congestion is associated with a better prognosis.
Therefore, the possibility to image pulmonary oedema at a sub-
clinical stage remains an attractive and elusive goal. Several clinical,
radiological, and non-imaging methods are currently used for evalu-
ating pulmonary fluid retention, but they are late and inaccurate
(physical examination), insensitive and imprecise (chest X-ray),
too complex for real time, repeated measurements in sick patients
(computerized tomography), or inadequately validated and not
widely available (conductance measurements with cardiac devices).1
Lung ultrasound (LUS) assessment of EVLW by B-lines provides an
excellent alternative,2,3 expanding the already established role
of transthoracic echocardiography in heart failure.4 B-lines can
be visualized using the cardiac transducer and appear on the

 antero-lateral chest scan as multiple laser-like signals arising from the
hyper-echoic pleural line, changing throughout the respiratory cycle,
with a to-and-fro movement synchronized with respiration (Figure 1).
The normal lung is black (no signal); the abnormal wet lung with inter-
stitial pulmonary oedema is black and white (with some B-lines de-
parting from the pleural line); and the lung with alveolar pulmonary
oedema is white (confluent B-lines in a fully echogenic lung).
The original term of comet-tail artefacts2 was subsequently used
interchangeably with ultrasound lung comets.4 Following the con-
sensus on terminology and standards, B-lines is now preferred.5
The term comets intuitively refers to the eye-catching pictorial
image, spreading like a rocket or the tail of a comet from the ultra-
sound transducer to the edge of the screen. B-lines may sound more
familiar for radiologists, as the ultrasound counterpart of the well-
known radiological Kerley B-lines, a sign of EVLW on chest X-ray.
The analogy is however imperfect, because A-lines on chest X-ray
(departing from the hila out to the periphery of the lung) are also
a sign of abnormal accumulation of EVLW. In contrast, with LUS,
‘A-lines’ refer to the normal appearance of horizontal, equidistant,
parallel artefacts originating at regular intervals from the pleural
line (visceral and parietal pleura) (Table 1).
The number of B-lines in the antero-lateral chest scan is usually
summed to generate a quantitative or semi-quantitative B-line score
(Table 2). Up to 2 B-lines per single intercostal space, or up to 5 in
the comprehensive antero-lateral chest scan can be a normal find-
ing,2,4 more frequent in the latero-basal areas.
Genesis and determinants of B-lines
In analogy with the counterpart of radiological B-lines, it was initially
proposed that the acoustic interface generating B-lines is the
sub-pleural interlobular septa thickened by oedema.2,3,4 This ana-
tomical model is conceptually helpful and appealingly simple, but
probably an oversimplification. According to the biophysical model
developed from in vitro and ex vivo models, the origin of B-lines is not
from a precise anatomic structure (interlobular septa) but rather
from reflections of discrete air/fluid interfaces between collapsed,
Figure 1 The recommended protocol for evaluating B-lines is performed by scanning 28-region protocol on the anterior chest with the patient
in the supine position.3,4,23

 fluid-filled, and well-aerated alveoli.6,7 The appearance of B-lines
corresponds to a progressive loss of air per volume of lung tissue
with a corresponding increase in relative and absolute content of
EVLW (from normal, ,5% or ,500 mL, to overt pulmonary
oedema, .90% or .2000 mL) (Figure 2).
The B-lines are detectable with cardiac, convex, or linear probes,
from 2.5 (cardiac) up 7.5 MHz (vascular) transducers.5 With a linear
probe, B-lines run in parallel over the screen, whereas with the
curvilinear probe, B-lines spread from the same proximal point of
convergence.
The depth should be adjusted according to the body habitus of the
patient, with thin patients requiring less depth and obese patients
needing greater depth to visualize the pleural line. Neither the width
of the sector angle nor the use of harmonic (instead of fundamental)
imaging are known to have an impact on the B-lines count, although
no systematic data are available.4,5 Higher frequencies and macro
probes are useful for the evaluation of pleural line and sub-pleural
space and may allow a better image of B-lines, but the overall number
does not change significantly by changing the transducer.4,5
The experimental and clinical
validation of B-lines for
extravascular lung water
Lung ultrasound has been applied to dogs with spontaneous left-
sided heart failure8 and to a pig model of oleic acid-induced lung in-
jury, which mimics human acute respiratory distress syndrome.9,10
In dogs and pigs, the same instrument, transducer, and chest scan
technique as used in humans can be adopted, making the translation-
al implications more straightforward. In the pig model, there was a
tight, linear correlation between the number of B-lines and wet/dry
ratio by gravimetric method post-mortem, which is the gold stand-
ard for EVLW9 (Figure 3, left panel). In man, the number of B-lines,
even assessed with a limited four-region scan of the anterior chest,
correlate closely with invasive evaluation of EVLW,11,12 matching
the experimental data (Figure 3, right panel). In intensive care patients
with invasive gold standard transpulmonary thermodilution mea-
surements of EVLW, LUS performed markedly better than chest
radiography (r ¼ 0.91 vs. r ¼ 0.33), with a 92.3% sensitivity and
91.7% specificity for detecting abnormal values of EVLW.12
The same pig model was used to address the equally clinically
relevant question as to whether B-lines could detect increased
EVLW before the appearance of functional impairment. B-lines
showed accumulation of EVLW very early in the course of lung in-
jury in pigs, at a stage when no changes in hemo-gas analytic para-
meters or chest X-ray findings could be observed10 (Figure 4).
In the clinical setting, several groups have shown how B-lines cor-
relate reasonably well with the imperfect gold standards of chest
X-ray4,13 and CT14 radiological score. The correlation is stronger
when intra-patient variations are considered.4
B-lines weakly correlate with clinical congestion score, cardiac
peptide levels,15 – 18 and pulmonary wedge pressures.11,19 This is
not unexpected, as in everyday practice, a patient can show variable
degrees of B-lines (from absent to severe) for any given level of pul-
monary artery wedge pressure, depending on the duration of

 history of heart failure, speed of changes in pulmonary pressure,
characteristics of the alveolar-capillary membrane, oncotic pres-
sure, and lymphatic drainage capacity. B-lines without haemodynam-
ic congestion are found in acute respiratory distress syndrome and
environmental pulmonary oedema. B-lines are EVLW, not pulmon-
ary wedge pressure.20
Diagnostic and prognostic value
in cardiology patients
B-lines are useful for the identification of cardiogenic origin of dys-
pnoea in the emergency room, with high sensitivity and excellent
specificity, yielding a 94% sensitivity and 92% specificity in differen-
tiating acute heart failure syndrome from non-cardiac causes of
acute dyspnoea as shown by a meta-analysis encompassing 1075 pa-
tients from seven different studies.21 These results were recently
corroborated by a multicentre study which enrolled 1005 patients
from seven Italian centres and showed that the LUS-based approach
was more accurate than initial clinical work-up, chest X-ray, and
natriuretic peptides.22
B-lines have a limited specificity and can be found in the area sur-
rounding isolated alveolar consolidations, from infectious, infiltra-
tive, or traumatic lung disease. Oedematous (wet) B-lines cannot
be readily distinguished from fibrotic (dry) B-lines associated with
thickening of sub-pleural intralobular or interlobular septa, as found
Figure 3 A very good correlation (R ¼ 0.91 in both cases) is shown between B-lines and extravascular lung water evaluated experimentally by
gravimetry in pigs with acute lung injury induced by oleic acid (left panel) and clinically by thermodilution in patients with acute lung injury-acute
respiratory distress syndrome (right panel).9,12

 for instance in systemic sclerosis.2,4,5 The consideration of the lim-
ited specificity is also important in assessing the diagnostic value and
high sensitivity of LUS for detection of pulmonary congestion, which
is strongly dependent on patient selection and comorbidities. In
addition, it is not always possible with B-lines alone to separate
EVLW accumulation due to heart failure or acute respiratory
distress syndrome, although the latter may show a more inhomo-
geneous and irregular pattern, sub-pleural consolidation, highly frag-
mented pleural line, and multiple B-lines alternating with spared
areas.5,20 Differentiation by LUS should include consideration of
the clinical context and may be supported by other modalities
such as echocardiography, which readily detects abnormal cardiac
or valvular function and increased pulmonary artery pressure during
acute heart failure syndrome.3,4
B-lines also have a striking prognostic value, shown in patients
with heart failure,23 –25 acute coronary syndrome,26 and dialysis.27
Persistent B-lines at pre-discharge assessment are associated with
a more malignant prognosis than B-lines on admission only.28,29 End-
stage kidney disease patients with concomitant heart failure with
very severe congestion (.60 B-lines) had a 4.2-fold increased risk
of death, compared with patients having no or mild congestion
(,15 B-lines).27 The prognostic value is independent and additive
over established clinical, imaging, and laboratory markers, such as
NYHA class of dyspnoea, pulmonary congestion signs such as
crackles, left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary artery systolic
pressure, or cardiac natriuretic peptide levels.23–27
Lung ultrasound also provides a useful biomarker to assess the
time course of lung water changes following interventions, since
within minutes or a few hours, B-lines in heart failure patients are
substantially reduced after diuretics,3,30 or following dialysis.31
B-lines stress echocardiography
Exercise may result in the sudden appearance or increase of B-lines
on the chest in heart failure patients (Figure 5), in whom an increase
in left ventricular filling pressures may occur with or without indu-
cible ischaemia.32,33 When B-lines develop or worsen during exer-
cise, resting levels of cardiac peptides and pulmonary pressures are
higher, as are the chances of an unfavourable outcome during short-
term follow-up.33
In addition, exercise-induced B-lines are detectable in patients with
chronic mountain sickness during exercise performed at 3.600 m, but
not in healthy high-altitude dwellers.34 The rapid lung interstitial fluid
accumulation can be prevented by oxygen inhalation.
Stress echo with B-lines can also be performed outdoors, with
pocket size instruments, in an entirely different setting of ecological
stress. The diagnostic target is the diagnosis, or early subclinical
identification, of life-threatening pulmonary oedema. In this challen-
ging but fascinating context, LUS detects B-lines in 20–50% of
super-fit subjects in extreme physiology settings, such as high alti-
tude35,36 or deep underwater apnoea diving37,38 (Figure 6).
Therefore, stress lung ultrasound may be useful to detect
exercise-induced heart failure and also to appreciate lung interstitial
fluid lung accumulation in the setting of extreme physiology
(Table 3).
Lung ultrasound in extreme physiology setting is perhaps the best
example of a new paradigm of ‘ecologic’ stress echocardiography,
performed outside the controlled hospital setting, where some con-
ditions—for instance, mental stress, psychological discomfort, en-
vironmental aggression, or extreme physiology states—cannot be
reproduced.39

 Advantages
Lung ultrasound is radiation-free, which will reduce the need for
chest-X rays in cardiology patients; such patients have commonly
been subjected to increased levels of diagnostic radiation expos-
ure.40 Lung ultrasound requires an imaging time of a few minutes.
Cardiac transducers work well for LUS, since they are designed
with a small footprint, allowing easy scanning between rib interspaces.
The methodology and findings of B-lines are similar in pigs, dogs,
and man.8–10
In consecutive patients studied in a cardiology environment, such
as echocardiography laboratory or intensive care unit, the feasibility
of LUS approaches 100%, with intra- and inter-observer variability
consistently ,5% and ,10%, respectively,3,11,18 and a mean differ-
ence of 0.3 B-lines between readers.25 The reproducibility is excel-
lent; thus, B-lines are ideally suited as a biomarker to assess
intra-patient changes over time.
B-lines are appealingly simple to use, to learn, and to teach. A 1-h
training session and a pocket size instrument are sufficient for a nov-
ice sonographer to reach the same accuracy in counting B-lines of a
highly experienced cardiologist with top-level equipment.41,42
B-lines are readily obtainable; their assessment should be consid-
ered in the primary care of the dyspnoic patient.
Lung ultrasound study provides considerable information beyond
assessing the presence of simple B-lines, from pleural effusion to
consolidations and pneumothorax. As B-lines originate from the vis-
ceral pleura, their simple presence proves that the visceral pleura is
opposing the parietal pleura, thus excluding pneumothorax at that
point. The absence of any movement of the pleural line, either hori-
zontal (sliding) or vertical (pulse), coupled with the absence of
B-lines strongly supports a clinical suspicion of pneumothorax.5,20
Limitations
For LUS, large wound dressings and subcutaneous emphysema may
limit access in ,1% of subjects. Soft tissue oedema or morbid obes-
ity can degrade the quality of images. In general, LUS complements
poor acoustic windows, and its feasibility is nearly 100%.20
Lung ultrasound only evaluates the sub-pleural cortical area,
extending for a depth of 2–4 cm.
The separation of wet, watery B-lines from fibrotic, dry, B-lines as
can be found in systemic sclerosis can be difficult with an isolated
LUS assessment: clinical context, integration with echocardiography
and dynamic evaluation are recommended.43 An accurate way to
identify wet B-lines is to follow their acute variation within minutes,
since they increase during exercise32,33 or volume loading20 and de-
crease following diuretics3,30 or dialysis31 (Table 4). There are also

 posture-dependent changes in lung water, with 25% more B-lines in
the supine compared with the sitting position in patients with acute
heart failure.44
Future perspectives
The diagnosis will become more objective through simple soft com-
puting algorithm.46 Major scientific societies might clear the field
from persisting terminology confusion and the lack of standardiza-
tion and better tailor the LUS to the needs of the cardiological im-
aging community. Large-scale prognostic validation in heart failure
patients undergoing exercise stress echo is under way as a specific
subproject of the ‘Stress Echo 2020’ study endorsed by the Italian
Society of Echocardiography. Randomized multicentre studies are
testing the hypothesis that B-line-guided therapy may improve clin-
ical outcome in high-risk haemodialysis patients with cardiomyop-
athy. Therefore, the dissemination of the technique due to its
obvious merits should go in parallel with an adequate assessment
in outcome studies. The clinical use of the technique still is ancillary.
Large-scale, randomized trials are needed to document to what
extent its use would benefit the cardiac patient with a failing heart
and to appreciate its limitations which could result in inappropriate
therapy.
Current recommendations
Bedside LUS was recognized in a scientific statement of ESC since
2010 as a ‘potentially useful way to assess pulmonary congestion’,1 and
recommended in 2015 as a first-line test in the evaluation of sus-
pected acute heart failure to assess pulmonary congestion,47,48 since
‘in reasonably expert hands LUS maybe equally or more informative than
chest X-ray allowing also an important time saving’.48 The 2012 recom-
mendations of an international committee on point-of-care LUS re-
cognized LUS as ideally suited for ‘monitoring pulmonary congestion
changes in heart failure patients as they disappear or clear upon adequate
medical treatment’.5
According to the 2016 EACVI recommendations, during exercise
stress echo the acute increase in B-lines detected by LUS is a feasible
way for demonstrating that the symptom ‘dyspnoea when exercising’ is
related to pulmonary congestion due to backward heart failure.49
EACVI recommendations for use of pocket size devices explicitly
list ‘semi-quantification of EVLW’ among the top 8 indications for
pocket size devices.50
Conclusions
B-lines are a sign of interstitial syndrome of mixed origin (fibrosis,
inflammation, and congestion), and in acute or chronic heart failure
patients they mostly represent the direct, positive image of lung
water, for a long time a forbidden fruit for the clinical cardiologist.
Through the lung water teaser, the cardiologist will become familiar
with the new diagnostic world of LUS, a friendly neighbour of
transthoracic echocardiography, of critical help in many different
and frequent clinical situations, from diagnosis and semi-quantification
of pleural effusion to fluid management in cardiogenic shock
to pneumothorax identification in differential diagnosis of dys-
pnoea.5,20,45 The rapidly dynamic nature of B-lines separates wet
B-lines made by water (decreased by diuretics) from dry B-lines
made of connective tissue. B-lines can be used anywhere (even in ex-
treme environmental conditions with pocket size devices), by anyone
(including novice sonographer) on anybody (since the superficial
acoustic window that is required usually is feasible even when echo-
cardiography is not feasible). Rarely, in cardiac imaging, we have so
much diagnostic gain with so little technological, training, and time
pain. Lung ultrasound can quantify lung oedema noninvasively in
real time, even at an early subclinical stage, with user-friendly, low
cost, radiation-free, and direct imaging of EVLW.
