Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent of hepatitis E in humans and a member of the genus Orthohepevirus
in the family Hepeviridae. HEV infections are the common cause of acute hepatitis but can also take chronic
courses. Ribavirin is the treatment of choice for most patients and type I interferon (IFN) has been evaluated in a
few infected transplantation patients in vivo. However, no effective and specific treatments against HEV infec-
tions are currently available.
In this study, we evaluated the natural compound silvestrol, isolated from the plant Aglaia foveolata, and
known for its specific inhibition of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A in state-of-the-art HEV experimental
model systems. Silvestrol blocked HEV replication of different subgenomic replicons in a dose-dependent
manner at low nanomolar concentrations and acted additive to ribavirin (RBV). In addition, HEV p6-based full
length replication and production of infectious particles was reduced in the presence of silvestrol. A pangen-
otypic effect of the compound was further demonstrated with primary isolates from four different human
genotypes in HEV infection experiments of hepatocyte-like cells derived from human embryonic and induced
pluripotent stem cells. In vivo, HEV RNA levels rapidly declined in the feces of treated mice while no effect was
observed in the vehicle treated control animals. In conclusion, silvestrol could be identified as pangenotypic HEV
replication inhibitor in vitro with additive effect to RBV and further demonstrated high potency in vivo. The
compound therefore may be considered in future treatment strategies of chronic hepatitis E in im-
munocompromised patients.
1. Introduction
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent of hepatitis E in hu-
mans and is classified as a member of the genus Orthohepevirus within
the Hepeviridae family. Worldwide, hepatitis E is the leading cause for
acute viral hepatitis. With approximately 20 million people infected
with HEV causing approx. 3.3 million cases of acute illness leading to
nearly 44.000–70.000 deaths per year, this pathogen has substantial
impact on humans life and needs to be socioeconomically considered
(Wedemeyer et al., 2012). At least four human-pathogenic HEV geno-
types exist (gt1-4). Genotype 1 and 2 solely infect humans and are
mainly present in developing areas causing water-borne outbreaks.
Pregnant women harbor a high risk for a fatal outcome during HEV gt1
infection with mortality rates up to 30% in the last trimester (Kamar
et al., 2017). In contrast, gt 3 and 4 are zoonotic pathogens with their
main reservoir in pigs, wild boars and deer (Sayed et al., 2015). Having
contact with these animals or consumption of contaminated meat-
products are major risk factors for acquiring an HEV infection. The

 latter genotypes are responsible for most of infections in industrialized
nations. HEV gt 3 infections in humans are usually self-limiting, but can
evolve also to chronicity in immunosuppressed individuals with the risk
for the development of liver cirrhosis and eventually hepatic decom-
pensation with the need for liver transplantation (Behrendt et al.,
2014). Current therapies used to treat HEV infections including riba-
virin and interferon-alpha have severe side effects and are contra-in-
dicated in pregnant woman. Furthermore, virus isolates have been re-
cently identified that possess lower ribavirin sensitivity leading to
higher treatment failure rates (Debing et al., 2014, 2016; Todt et al.,
2016a, 2016b). Therefore, efficacious and safe antiviral treatments
against HEV are urgently needed.
In a screening approach for novel HEV inhibitors, we identified the
natural compound silvestrol. Silvestrol is a structurally unique cyclo-
penta[b]benzofuran that can be isolated from the plant Aglaia foveolata
belonging to the family of Meliacae (Kim et al., 2007). It is described as
a highly efficient, non-toxic and specific inhibitor of the DEAD-box RNA
helicase eIF4A (Bordeleau et al., 2008), which is part of the eIF4F
complex that drives cap-dependent translation initiation in eukaryotes
(Silvera et al., 2010). In this study, we show that silvestrol inhibits the
replication of different HEV gts in a dose-dependent manner at low
nanomolar concentrations. This anti-HEV activity was further observed
in infection experiments with laboratory and primary isolates in human
liver cells and in vivo using humanized mice. These results identify
silvestrol as a novel natural compound that blocks HEV replication and
could therefore be part of an antiviral strategy for the treatment of HEV
infections.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Compounds and reagents
Silvestrol
was
received
from
MedChem
Express
(Monmouth
Junction, NJ, USA). Ribavirin (RBV) was received from Sigma Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA. All compounds were stored and diluted according
to manufacturer's recommendations.
2.2. Cell culture
The human liver cell lines HepG2 and Huh7.5 were cultured in
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe,
Germany) supplemented with 10% FCS (GE Healthcare), 100 μg/mL of
streptomycin and 100 IU/mL of penicillin (Invitrogen), 2 mM L-gluta-
mine and 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) (DMEM complete).
The HepG2/C3A subclone was cultured in Eagle's minimum essential
medium (MEM with glutamine, Invitrogen), 10% ultra-low IgG FCS
(Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 μg/mL gentamicin, 1 mM sodium
pyruvate and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). HepG2 and
HepG2/C3A cells were further grown on rat collagen-coated (SERVA
Electrophoresis GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) culture plates. Cells were
kept at 37 °C in a 5% (vol/vol) CO2 incubator.
2.3. HEV constructs and in vitro transcription
A plasmid construct containing
the full-length HEV genome
(Kernow-C1 p6 clone, gt3; GenBank accession no. JQ679013) and four
constructs harboring a subgenomic HEV sequence coupled to a Gaussia
luciferase reporter gene were used to generate HEV in vitro transcripts
as previously described (Drave et al., 2016). One of the constructs de-
rives from the gt1 Sar55/S17 strain (based on clone pSK E2, GenBank
accession no. AF444002) and two other constructs are based on the
Kernow-C1 p6 genome of which one contains the polymerase mutation
G1634R (Todt et al., 2016a). The other gt3 Gaussia luciferase coupled
construct derives from the G3-HEV83-2-27 virus (gt3; GenBank acces-
sion no. AB740232) and was a kind gift of the laboratory of Takaji
Wakita. Capping of all constructs was performed using Ribom7G Cap
Analog (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). A HCV JFH1 subgenomic re-
plicon was used as reference construct as described (Anggakusuma
et al., 2015).
2.4. HEV primary isolates
Primary isolates gt1 strain Sar-55 (1.21 × 108 viral RNA copies/mL)
and gt2 Mexico-14 (1.65 × 106 viral RNA copies/mL) in 10% fecal
suspension from infected macaques and Kernow-C1 P1 supernatant
from HepG2 cells (2.3 × 106 viral RNA copies/mL), were a kind gift
from Suzanne U. Emerson (Emerson et al., 2004). Primary isolates gt3
strain US-2 (1.6 × 104 viral RNA copies/mL) and gt4 strain TW6196E
(9.39 × 103 viral RNA copies/mL) in 10% fecal suspension from in-
fected pigs were a kind gift from Xiang-Jin Meng (Virginia Tech)
(Feagins et al., 2008).
2.5. Generation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells
and HEV infection
ESC or iPSC were differentiated into HLCs as previously described
(Wu et al., 2018).
2.6. Infection of humanized mice
Human liver chimeric mice (humanized mice) were generated by
transplantation of primary human hepatocytes (donor HH223, Corning)
into
homozygous
uPA+/+-SCID
mice,
as
previously
described
(Meuleman et al., 2005). Humanized mice were inoculated via in-
trasplenic route with a filtered fecal suspension containing 2,8 × 105 IU
of the genotype 1 HEV strain Sar-55 (generously provided by Dr. Su-
zanne Emerson, NIH, USA). Four weeks after inoculation, mice were
treated with a daily intraperitoneal dose of 0.3 mg/kg silvestrol, for-
mulated in 30% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma-Aldrich), or
vehicle only. Stool samples were collected on a daily basis and viral
RNA was detected and quantified in mouse 10% stool suspensions using
a previously described RT-qPCR (Sayed et al., 2017).
2.7. Statistical analysis
Dose-dependent inhibition of replication was plotted using GrahPad
Prism v7.03 for Windows (La Jolla California USA, www.graphpad.
com) and IC50, IC90 and CC50 were calculated using the four-parameter
log-logistic model. Statistical significance of differences of means was
calculated using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple
comparison test were indicated. P values < 0.05 were considered
significant (n.s. non-significant).
3. Results
3.1. Antiviral activity of silvestrol against subgenomic HEV replication
HEV and other viral mRNAs contain highly structured 5′-UTRs that
need to be translated by the cellular translation machinery in order to
promote viral protein synthesis. Silvestrol is a specific inhibitor of the
host encoded eIF4A, an RNA helicase that promotes 5′ cap-dependent
translation initiation (Gingras et al., 1999). To analyse the effect of
silvestrol against HEV, we first transfected the human hepatoma cell
line Huh7.5 with different HEV subgenomic replicons, in which a part
of the ORF2 was replaced by a Gaussia luciferase reporter gene. These
include the HEV gt 3 construct p6 (Shukla et al., 2011), a variant
(G1634R) thereof with increased replication fitness (Debing et al.,
2014; Todt et al., 2016a), the gt3-based wild boar isolate 83-2-27
(Shiota et al., 2013) and the gt 1 strain Sar55 harboring an S17 inser-
tion in the ORF1 like the p6 strain (Shukla et al., 2011). As depicted in
Fig. 1A, incubation of silvestrol for 24 h resulted in a dose-dependent
inhibition of HEV replication with inhibitory concentrations 50 (IC50)
D. Todt et al.
�������������������������������������
���
 of 4–6.6 nM for the different HEV constructs (Fig. 1A and Table 1). For
the known HEV inhibitor RBV, 1000-fold higher concentrations in μM
range were needed to inhibit HEV replication (IC50 8–12 μM, Fig. 1A
and Table 1). For the gt1 replicon an IC50 of 43 μM was observed for
RBV (Fig. 1A and Table 1). HCV was employed as a reference virus and
was less susceptible to silvestrol as translation initiation occurs cap-
independent via an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) (Fig. 1A). Cell
viability was determined by an MTT assay, in which the enzymatic
activity started to decrease at higher concentrations, but did not reach a
cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) in line with reported data (Cencic
et al., 2009; Biedenkopf et al., 2017) (Fig. 1A). Additionally, determi-
nation of viable cells under silvestrol treatment demonstrated no sig-
nificant reductions (Fig. 1B). Treatment of silvestrol for 42 h resulted in
even lower IC50 values for example 2.9 nM for the p6 strain with a CC50
value of 24.8 nM (Fig. 1C and Table 1), resulting in a selectivity index of
about 8.6. Longer incubation times in the presence of silvestrol resulted
in decreased cell viability (data not shown). Overall, RBV and cell
viability profiles at 42 h were similar in comparison to the shorter
treatment (Fig. 1C and D). Next, the inhibitory effect of silvestrol was
evaluated in the full-length p6 clone in Huh7.5 cells. To visualize HEV
antigen
expression,
we
performed
indirect
immunofluorescence
staining of the structural capsid protein ORF2. As depicted in Fig. 1E,
ORF2 positive cells were highly reduced in the high dose (10 nM) sil-
vestrol and RBV-treated cells (Fig. 1E). In summary, the natural com-
pound silvestrol demonstrates an antiviral activity against different
HEV gts at non-toxic concentrations.

legend for color coding). Cell viability was mon-
itored via MTT assay and is shown as dotted line. In
addition, antiproliferative properties of silvestrol
(medium
concentration:
10 nM
and
high
con-
centration: 100 nM) were assessed via visual cell
counting after trypan blue staining and compared
to ribavirin treated (50 μM) and untreated cells (B,

 3.2. Inhibition of cell culture- and patient-derived HEV infection by
silvestrol
Next, we evaluated the antiviral effect of silvestrol in HEV infection
experiments using cell culture-derived infectious HEV (HEVCC) based
on the p6 isolate (Dao Thi et al., 2016) in HepG2/C3A cells and patient-
derived HEV of gts 1–4 in pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like
cells (HLCs) (Wu et al., 2018). At first, we evaluated the antiviral ac-
tivity of silvestrol with the HEVp6 replicon in the HepG2/C3A cell line
and observed a shift of the dose-response curves in comparison to
Huh7.5 (suppl. Fig. 1). In case of the HEVCC infection assay, treatment
setups with silvestrol with a concentration of 10, 20 and 50 nM between
24 h and 48 h, day 6 and day 7 or at both time intervals were carried
out (Fig. 2A). The experimental read out was the determination of in-
fectious particle production in focus forming units (FFU/mL) from the
cell lysate after the first round of infection (Fig. 2A). The inhibition of
HEV replication was most prominent with the 20 nM and 50 nM treat-
ment at the late time point (Fig. 2B). RBV treatment served as a control
and demonstrated inhibitory effects in the late treatment and combi-
natory arms (Fig. 2B). For all silvestrol incubations cell viability was not
reduced (Fig. 2C). Next, patient-derived HEV from gts 1–4 were used to
infect HLCs and treated 24 h post-infection with silvestrol for 24 h
(Fig. 2A). The inhibitory effect of the natural compound for non-
adapted HEV isolates in non-carcinoma cell lines was confirmed in all
major human pathogenic genotypes (Fig. 2D) without cytotoxicity
(Fig. 2E). In conclusion, infection of hepatoma or HLC cells with dif-
ferent HEV isolates can be reduced by the treatment with silvestrol.
3.3. Inhibitory effects of silvestrol in human liver chimeric mice infected
with HEV
Recently, several studies demonstrated that human liver chimeric
mice can be infected with HEV and are useful tools for studying chronic
HEV infection and antiviral drugs in vivo (Allweiss and Dandri, 2016;
van de Garde et al., 2016; Sayed et al., 2017). To evaluate the antiviral
effects of silvestrol in vivo, we chose based on previous work (Hwang
et al., 2004; Saradhi et al., 2011), a silvestrol dose of 0.3 mg/kg, which
was administered intraperitoneally to gt1 HEV (strain Sar-55) infected
mice. Two mice were treated on a daily basis for ten days or six days
respectively. Two additional served as control and were only treated
with the vehicle. As depicted in Fig. 3A, during the first days of treat-
ment a rapid decline in HEV RNA was observed in the feces of all
treated mice, while no effect was observed in the vehicle treated control
animals (Fig. 3A). No changes in body weight of either animal were
noted over the monitored period. Successful engraftment of human
hepatocyte into the mouse livers was ensured by assessing human
serum albumin levels in blood samples drawn before and after the
treatment (supp. Fig. 2). These results implicate a strong antiviral effect
of silvestrol in an HEV animal model system.
3.4. Combinatory activity of silvestrol with RBV
As RBV is the treatment of choice as off-label medication in
chronically infected patients, we next performed combinatory treat-
ments of silvestrol and RBV. Following electroporation of Huh7.5 cells
with HEVp6 RNA genome harboring a Gaussia luciferase reporter gene,
cells were grown in presence of various doses of silvestrol or RBV or
their combinations. Luciferase assay read-out was performed after 24 h
or 42 h of treatment. To characterize the interactions of the combined
drugs, compounds were mixed at various molar ratios about matching
their equipotent concentrations (silvestrol:RBV 1:250–1:32,000) and
analyzed using CompuSyn software (Fig. 4). According to the method of
Chou-Talalay (Chou and Talalay, 1984), combination indices (CI) were
calculated. CIs for IC50, IC75 and IC90 after 24 h treatment range be-
tween 0.70 and 1.39. After 42 h of treatment, indices ranged from 0.76
to 1.42 indicating additive antiviral effects when combining silvestrol
and ribavirin. This is also reflected by the positioning of the experi-
mental data points in close proximity to the line of additivity in the
isobologram (Fig. 4A, C) for all fractions. In addition, data were ana-
lyzed according to the Bliss independence model (Prichard Shipman
1990) and three-dimensional differential surface plots are depicted in
Fig. 4B for the 24 h treatment and in Fig. 4D for the 42 h treatment.
Here, we observed a minimal elevation above the plane after 24 h for
the low silvestrol concentrations and a minor decrease below the plane
after 42 h for the low silvestrol concentrations.
Taken together, these results suggest minimal changes in the mode
of additivity for the combination of silvestrol and RBV at the different
ratios employed. In this assay setup, both drugs showed additive effects
in the inhibition of HEV replicon replication.
4. Discussion
Most of cellular and viral mRNAs rely on cap-dependent mRNA
translation. The canonical mechanism of initiation commences with
recognition of 5′ end m7GpppN cap structure by the eIF4F complex
formed by the DEAD-box helicase eIF4A, the scaffolding protein eIF4G

 and the cap recognition factor eIF4E (Sonenberg and Hinnebusch,
2009). The natural compound silvestrol, which has been identified in
this study as a novel HEV inhibitor, has been reported to have the
ability of modulating translation by preventing ribosome loading onto
mRNA templates by targeting this eIF4A eukaryotic initiation factor
(Bordeleau et al., 2008; Cencic et al., 2009). Interestingly, Zhou et al.
previously investigated the role of the eIF4F complex in HEV
replication and found in line with the activity of silvestrol described
here, that efficient replication of HEV requires the mRNA translation
machinery eIF4A, eIF4G and eIF4E (Zhou et al., 2015). Programmed
cell death 4 (PDCD4) and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), the ne-
gative regulatory factors of this complex, exerted anti-HEV activities,
which further illustrated the requirement for eIF4A and eIF4E in sup-
porting HEV replication (Zhou et al., 2015). Therefore, molecules like

 silvestrol targeting these mRNA translation host factors open new
perspectives
for future antiviral
strategies. Host-targeting
agents
(HTAs) are likely to exhibit a higher barrier of viral resistance devel-
opment compared to specific viral targets. An antiviral activity for sil-
vestrol has been described for Ebola virus replication (Biedenkopf et al.,
2017). Inhibition of viral propagation by treatment with silvestrol oc-
curred more rapidly than any effects on cellular functions and an IC50
lower than 1 nM was observed (Biedenkopf et al., 2017). Very recently,
potent antiviral activities were also reported for coronaviruses in-
cluding MERS-CoV and picornaviruses revealing broad-spectrum ac-
tivities (Muller et al., 2018). For HEV, we observed also an antiviral
activity at low nanomolar concentrations for the human gts 1 and 3, a
gt3 swine isolate as well as for a viral variant, which was identified in
HEV-infected patients and confers enhanced replication fitness (Fig. 1)
(Debing et al., 2014; Todt et al., 2016a). HCV as cap-independent re-
plication control was less susceptible to silvestrol, however, also the

 IRES-dependent translation machinery might require the help of addi-
tional
translation
initiation
factors
from
the
infected
host
cell
(Thompson, 2012). The anti-HEV activity of silvestrol was subsequently
confirmed in viral infection assays by determination of production of
infectious particles after compound incubation. However, the overall
antiviral activity of silvestrol was reduced in this assay compared to the
replicon system in Huh7.5, as in HepG2/C3A cells higher concentration
of the drug were needed (suppl. Fig. 1). In addition, a pangenotypic
activity of silvestrol was observed using primary isolates from four
different gts in HLCs derived from human embryonic and induced
pluripotent stem cells (Fig. 2). HLCs offer an improved, physiologically
relevant traceable system for studying the replication and antiviral re-
sponse of primary HEV isolates (Wu et al., 2018).
Previously, silvestrol has been mainly characterized in antitumor
models such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leu-
kemia, mantle cell lymphoma and also hepatocellular carcinoma
(Cencic et al., 2009; Lucas et al., 2009; Alinari et al., 2012; Kogure
et al., 2013). Noteworthy, clinical efforts are underway to target spe-
cific components of the translation apparatus or unique mRNA trans-
lation elements in cancer therapeutics (Silvera et al., 2010; Bhat et al.,
2015). Based on these in vivo studies, the inhibitory effect of silvestrol
was additionally investigated in humanized mice infected with gt1
HEV, which showed a reduction of viral loads in the first few days of
treatment (Fig. 3). This proof of concept validation in vivo should guide
further silvestrol-based antiviral strategies, which could also involve
combination treatments with RBV. Combining two drugs with distinct
mechanisms of action involves the advantage of possible synergistic
antiviral effects and decreased danger of the emergence of resistances,
which is of exceptional importance in the therapeutic intervention for
chronically HEV infected immunosuppressed patients (Debing et al.,
2016; Todt et al., 2016a). In addition, synergistic antiviral effects imply
the possibility to reduce the dose or dosing frequency of any of the two
compounds, or even both, minimizing potential toxicity and adverse
effects. Here, we employed two models to analyse interactions between
silvestrol and RBV in combination according to the recommendations
by Zhao and colleagues (Zhao et al., 2010). Both, combination indices
and isobolograms calculated based on the Chou-Talalay method, as well
as the three-dimensional surface plot determined using the Bliss in-
dependence model, suggest additive antiviral effects of the drugs
(Fig. 4). As also slight deviations from the line of additivity and the
planar plot were observed at extreme doses of antivirals (low and high
effect levels), careful titration of the compounds in vitro and in vivo is
recommended to identify the optimal ratio of the drugs for increased
antiviral activity along with a reduced danger of the emergence of re-
sistances and improved tolerability in clinical settings.
In summary, the natural compound silvestrol, which specifically
targets the host factor eIF4A during cap-dependent translation initia-
tion, could be identified as novel pangenotypic anti-HEV agent. Viral
replication was inhibited by silvestrol in a dose-dependent manner at
low nanomolar concentrations in different HEV experimental model
systems including HEV primary isolates and HEV-infected humanized
mice. Thus, silvestrol may be considered in future treatment strategies
of chronic hepatitis E in immunocompromised patients.
