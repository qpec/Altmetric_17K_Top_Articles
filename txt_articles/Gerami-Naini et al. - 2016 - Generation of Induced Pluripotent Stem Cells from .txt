Abstract
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are nonhealing chronic wounds that are a serious complication of diabetes. Since
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may offer a potent source of autologous cells to heal these wounds, we
studied if repair-deficient fibroblasts, derived from DFU patients and age- and site-matched control fibroblasts,
could be reprogrammed to iPSCs. To establish this, we used Sendai virus to successfully reprogram six primary
fibroblast cell lines derived from ulcerated skin of two DFU patients (DFU8, DFU25), nonulcerated foot skin from
two diabetic patients (DFF24, DFF9), and healthy foot skin from two nondiabetic patients (NFF12, NFF14). We
confirmed reprogramming to a pluripotent state through three independent criteria: immunofluorescent staining
for SSEA-4 and TRA-1-81, formation of embryoid bodies with differentiation potential to all three embryonic
germ layers in vitro, and formation of teratomas in vivo. All iPSC lines showed normal karyotypes and typical,
nonmethylated CpG sites for OCT4 and NANOG. iPSCs derived from DFUs were similar to those derived from
site-matched nonulcerated skin from both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. These results have established for the
first time that multiple, DFU-derived fibroblast cell lines can be reprogrammed with efficiencies similar to control
fibroblasts, thus demonstrating their utility for future regenerative therapy of DFUs.
Introduction
D
iabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a serious diabetic
complication that may lead to prolonged hospitaliza-
tions and limb amputation. This condition is linked to altered
production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (Claudy
et al., 1991; Falanga, 1993; Loots et al., 1998), aberrant in-
flammatory responses (Rosner et al., 1995), and altered
growth factor-mediated and angiogenic responses.
While our understanding of the pathogenesis of DFUs has
increased in recent years (Falanga, 1993; Gurtner et al., 2008;
Stojadinovic et al., 2005), it has not been fully exploited to
develop new treatments to improve their healing. Existing
therapies, such as growth factor treatment (Falanga et al.,
1992) and bioactive dressings harboring naı
¨ve fibroblasts that
do not integrate into host tissues (Dinh and Veves 2006),
require repeated therapeutic applications that increase the
costs of caring for these wounds (Ehrenreich and Ruszczak,
2006; Mustoe et al., 2006). There is a compelling need to
develop alternative cell-based therapies to treat the debili-
tating complications that result from the inability to heal
DFUs (Gurtner et al., 2008; Stojadinovic et al., 2005).
Studies have shown the great potential of cellular repro-
gramming to generate human induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) as a valuable source of autologous cells for
regenerative therapies (Lowry et al., 2008). Previously, we
have shown that iPSC-derived fibroblasts trigger a repair-
promoting phenotype (Hewitt et al., 2011; Shamis et al.,
2011), while others have shown that reprogramming leads to
an extended replicative potential (Yehezkel et al., 2011) and

 improved mitochondrial function (Suhr et al., 2010) when
compared with fibroblasts from which they were initially
reprogrammed. However, it is unknown if iPSCs that are
derived specifically from DFUs can be used to differentiate
cells with a biological function that may improve wound
repair when these cells are used to treat DFUs.
As a step toward this goal, we demonstrate the first suc-
cessful reprogramming to iPSCs of primary fibroblast cell
lines derived from chronic nonhealing DFUs. In addition to
deriving iPSC lines from chronic nonhealing DFUs (DFU8,
DFU25), iPSCs were also derived from the nonulcerated
foot skin of two diabetic patients (DFF9, DFF24) and from
the healthy foot skin of two nondiabetic patients (NFF12,
NFF14). These findings provide evidence that DFU-derived
fibroblasts can be fully reprogrammed to iPSCs.
Generation of iPSCs derived from fibroblasts harboring
multiple phenotypic alterations from diabetic patients now
offers new opportunities to model complex diseases when
these iPSCs are differentiated into a variety of cell types di-
rectly relevant to diabetic complications. Future studies with
DFU-derived iPSCs will advance our understanding of how
to best activate regenerative functions upon iPSC differen-
tiation that can shift nonhealing fibroblasts to a healing-
competent phenotype to ameliorate diabetic complications
such as DFUs.
Materials and Methods
Biopsies of DFUs and site-matched diabetic
and healthy control patients
Primary fibroblasts were isolated from deidentified skin
specimens collected under a protocol approved by the Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Review
Board. Patient selection and skin biopsies were obtained
after informed consent from healthy subjects (NFF) and
patients (DFF, DFU) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center. Three groups of fibroblasts were isolated, including
DFU-derived fibroblasts, nonulcerated, site-matched, dia-
betic foot fibroblasts (DFFs) and nonulcerated, site-matched,
nondiabetic foot fibroblasts (NFFs).
Briefly, tissues were incubated overnight at 4�C in 1 mg/
mL dispase solution in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s me-
dium (DMEM)/F-12 (Life Technologies) to remove the
epidermis. The dermal tissue was minced and incubated in
1.5 mg/mL collagenase solution (Invitrogen) and 125 U/mL
hyaluronidase (Sigma) in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) for 1
hour. Red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma) was added for 2
minutes, and cells were collected by centrifugation.
All fibroblasts were expanded and maintained in fibro-
blast growth media consisting of DMEM (Life Technolo-
gies), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone), HEPES
(Sigma), and antibiotic–antimycotic (Life Technologies) at
37�C. Fibroblasts were passaged when confluent using
0.05% trypsin/EDTA and experiments were conducted with
cells between passages 4 and 7. Cultures were routinely
screened for mycoplasma.
Human fibroblast reprogramming
Reprogramming of fibroblasts from NFF, DFU, and DFF
cell lines was performed using the CytoTune�-iPS 2.0
Sendai Reprogramming Kit (Life Technologies). Approxi-
mately 1 · 105 human fibroblasts were transferred onto ad-
herent, gelatin-coated tissue culture wells of a six-well plate
and cultured with fibroblast medium (DMEM with 10%
FBS, 1% HEPES; Life Technologies). The next day, the
culture media were changed and the cells were infected with
Sendai virus (SeV) at the following multiplicities of infec-
tion (MOIs): MOI = 5· for hKOS, MOI = 5· for hcMyc, and
MOI = 3· for hKlf4. Twenty-four hours after transduction,
the supernatant was aspirated and fresh fibroblast medium
was added. Cell culture continued for an additional 6 days
and the medium was changed every other day.
Seven days after transduction, fibroblasts were har-
vested and 1.5 · 105 cells were plated into a six-well plate,
which was seeded with a gamma-irradiated mouse em-
bryonic fibroblast (irMEF) feeder layer (R&D Systems).
One day after seeding transduced fibroblasts, the medium
was changed to iPSC medium containing 80% DMEM/
F-12 (Life Technologies), 20% KnockOut Serum Re-
placement (Life Technologies), 1· Glutamax (Life Tech-
nologies), 0.1 mM b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 1%
nonessential amino acid (NEAA) stock (Life Technolo-
gies). Fully reprogrammed iPSC colonies were transferred
to freshly prepared 12-well irMEF plates. iPSC cultures
were then maintained on six-well irMEF plates. The me-
dium was changed daily with the addition of 8 ng/mL
FGF-2 (ProSpec). Plates were incubated at 37�C, 5% CO2
(Takahashi et al., 2007; Thomson et al., 1998).
Live staining of iPSCs reprogrammed from DFU, DFF,
and NFF cell lines
The morphology of reprogrammed iPSCs showed small
cells with a large nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and well-defined
edges similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells with respect
to their size and shape. Analysis of morphological character-
istics of iPSCs derived from DFUs (iDFU), DFFs (iDFF), and
NFFs (iNFF) was similar regardless of their patient back-
ground and revealed tight and flat colonies similar to what has
been observed from human ES cells and iPSCs generated
from other approaches (Lowry et al., 2008; Park et al., 2008;
Takahashi et al., 2007; Thomson et al., 1998).
To characterize colonies generated from SeV-infected skin
fibroblasts, we picked an average of 20–30 colonies from
each cell line. We utilized a live staining approach (Lowry
et al., 2008) to select only the colonies that stained posi-
tively for both SSEA-4 (Millipore) and TRA-1-81 (BD Bio-
sciences) antibodies confirming that the iPSCs were fully
reprogrammed.
On the day that colonies were large enough to be picked,
the supernatant was aspirated and each well was washed
once with prewarmed DMEM/F-12. The diluted conjugated
SSEA-4 (Millipore) and TRA-1-81 (BD Biosciences) anti-
bodies were added (1:1000) and incubated at 37�C, 5% CO2,
for *90 minutes. Cells were washed twice with DMEM/
F12 and 3 mL of fresh, prewarmed iPSC medium was added
to each well. Colonies were evaluated using a fluorescent
microscope, and fully reprogrammed colonies were distin-
guished from partially reprogrammed iPSCs by the presence
of both SSEA-4 (Millipore) and TRA-1-81 (BD Biosciences)
immunofluorescent staining.
A total of six cell lines, two lines from DFF: iDFF24,
iDFF9, two lines from DFU: iDFU8, iDFU25, and two lines

 from NFF: iNFF12 and iNFF14, were generated. We then
chose one clone from each of these lines on which to perform
our analysis; iDFF24.10, iDFF9.5, iDFU8.2, iDFU25.10,
iNFF12.5, iNFF14.6. A representative of all six clones was
then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), stained for
pluripotency-associated markers, SSEA-4 (Millipore), TRA-
1-81 (BD Biosciences), and OCT4 (Abcam), and counter-
stained with DAPI (Vector) to confirm that they were fully
reprogrammed.
Embryoid body formation
Approximately 10 · 106 iPSCs were used to generate em-
bryoid bodies (EBs) in six-well plates. iPSCs were rinsed with
2 mL Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Life
Technologies) and enzymatically treated with a mixture of
1 mL collagenase, type IV (1 mg/mL in DMEM; Life Tech-
nologies), and 0.5 mL dispase (10 mg/mL in DMEM; Life
Technologies) at 37�C, 5% CO2, for 5–7 minutes. When the
majority of the colonies detached from the plate as aggregates,
they were filtered through a cell strainer (40 lm; BD Falcon)
onto a six-well ultralow cluster cell culture plate (Corning)
using 15mL iPSC medium without FGF-2 (2.5mL/well).
Plates were then incubated under standard conditions (37�C,
5% CO2) for 7 days to allow the iPSCs to aggregate into
spheroid structures and to prevent adherence to the plate.
From days 2 to 7, half of the medium was replaced with
medium consisting of 68% DMEM/F-12 (Life Technolo-
gies) supplemented with 1% Pen/Strep (Life Technologies),
15% KOSR (Life Technologies), 15% FBS (heat in-
activated, FBS; Hyclone), 1· Glutamax (Life Technolo-
gies), 0.1 mM b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 1% NEAA
stock (Life Technologies) (Gerami-Naini et al., 2004).
Spontaneous differentiation of iPSCs
We examined the in vitro differentiation of iPSCs using an
EB differentiation approach. iPSCs were cultured in suspen-
sion using iPSC medium without adding any FGF-2 for 7 days
to form EBs. EBs were then seeded onto Matrigel-coated
(Corning) plates and cultured with endodermal (STEMCELL
Technologies), ectodermal (Life Technologies), or meso-
derm differentiation media (EB media as mentioned above).
Immunofluorescent staining identified cells positive for the
endodermal marker: a-fetoprotein (AFP; Millipore), the ecto-
dermal marker, bIII-tubulin (Millipore), and the mesodermal
marker, Vimentin (Abcam), to demonstrate that the iPSCs de-
rived from NFF, DFF, and DFU cell lines (iNFF, iDFF, and
iDFU cell lines) have the potential to differentiate into all three
germ layers.
Teratoma formation
For the teratoma formation assay, we chose one represen-
tative iPSC line from iNFF, iDFF, and iDFU. These cells were
cultured on irMEFs and treated with 1 mg/mL collagenase IV
(Life Technologies) dissolved in 37�C DMEM (Life Tech-
nologies), until detachment of the edges of the iPSC colonies
was detected. Approximately 5 · 106 iPSCs in 100 lL DMEM
were injected into the rear leg muscles of 5-week-old severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Taconic). A total of
10 mice were injected.
Mice were sacrificed 8–10 weeks after injection and tis-
sues were excised, washed with PBS, fixed in cold 4% PFA,
and processed for paraffin embedding. Sectioned slides were
stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and a variety of
cell types representing all three germ layers confirming the
presence of teratomas were identified. This study was car-
ried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the
National Institutes of Health.
Karyotyping
Standard G-banding chromosome analysis was performed
for all six lines of iDFF, iDFU, and iNFF at the Cytogenetics
Laboratory at Tufts Medical School Department of Patho-
logy and Laboratory Medicine.
Bisulfite pyrosequencing
To evaluate the degree of DNA methylation of the human
OCT4 and NANOG promoter in iPSCs, gDNA extracts were
sent to EpigenDx and analyzed by bisulfite modification and
pyrosequencing analysis of their promoter. Quantitative
methylation analyses of six CpG islands in the proximal
NANOG promoter were performed through pyrosequencing
(EpigenDx) using the ADS502/Human NANOG promoter as-
say, spanning positions -565 to -431 relative to the NANOG
ATG start site (Brakensiek et al., 2007; Tost et al., 2003).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) analysis
For analysis of the presence of SeV genome, RNA was
isolated from early (p.3) and late passage (after p.15) iPS cell
lines using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. Five hundred nano-
grams of RNA was reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was per-
formed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Cycling
conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95�C for 3
minutes; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95�C for 10 seconds,
annealing at 55�C for 10 seconds, extension at 72�C for 30
seconds; and a final step at 95�C for 1 minute. SeV forward
primer was 5¢-GGATCACTAGGTGATATCGAGC-3¢. SeV
reverse primer was 5¢-ACCAGACAAGAGTTTAAGAGA
TATGTATC-3¢.
For analysis of the presence of mesenchymal markers in
fibroblasts, RNA was isolated from primary fibroblasts and
fibroblasts differentiated from iPSCs using the Qiagen
RNeasy Mini Kit. Five hundred nanograms of RNA was
reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Bio-Rad).
qPCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad). Cycling conditions for alpha smooth muscle
actin (ACTA2) were as follows: initial denaturation at 95�C
for 2 minutes; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95�C for 5
seconds, annealing at 60�C for 30 seconds; and a final step
at 95�C for 5 seconds. ACTA2 forward primer was 5¢-
CATCTCCAGAGTCCAGCACA-3¢. ACTA2 reverse pri-
mer was 5¢-ACTGGGACG ACATGGAAAAG-3¢. Cycling
conditions for Vimentin were as follows: initial denatur-
ation at 95�C for 3 minutes; 40 cycles of denaturation at
95�C for 10 seconds, annealing at 55.6�C for 10 seconds,

 for 1 minute. Vimentin forward primer was 5¢-ATTCCACT
TTGCGTTCAAGG-3¢. Vimentin reverse primer was 5¢-CT
TCAGAGAGAGGAAGCCGA-3¢.
Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH. Cycling
conditions for GAPDH were as follows: initial denaturation
at 95�C for 3 minutes; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95�C for
10 seconds, annealing at 59.2�C for 10 seconds, extension at
72�C for 30 seconds; and a final step at 95�C for 1 minute.
GAPDH forward primer was 5¢-TGCACCACCAACTGCT

iPSC differentiation toward fibroblasts
iPSC (iNFF, iDFF, iDFU) differentiation toward fibro-
blasts was performed according to our previously published
protocol (Hewitt et al., 2009). Approximately 1 · 106 MEFs
were cultured in six-well plates until confluent. MEF cells
were then fixed in 4% PFA. iDFU25 cells were passaged at a
ratio of 1:6 and cultured in normal human keratinocyte me-
dium containing 3:1 DMEM:F12 (Life Technologies), 5%
FCII (Hyclone), 0.18 mM adenine (ICN Biomedicals), 8 mM
HEPES (Sigma), 0.5 lg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10-10 M
cholera toxin (MP Biological), 10 ng/mL epidermal growth
factor (Austral Biological), and 5 lg/mL insulin (Millipore)
(NHK medium). At day 4, 0.5 nM human bone morphoge-
netic protein-4 (BMP-4; R&D Systems) was added for 3 days.
At day 7, cells were passaged 1:3 onto a fresh fixed MEF
feeder layer and cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Life Technolo-
gies), 5% FCII (Hyclone), and 1% NEAA and grown for 7
days. At day 14, cells were passaged 1:3 onto a six-well
plate (Falcon) without any coating and grown in NHK
medium. Cells were expanded on day 21 using type I col-
lagen-coated plates (BD Biosciences).
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry assay was performed as follows: DFU25
and fibroblasts generated from iDFU25 cells (iDFU25-Fib1)
were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in 2% FBS in
PBS. The cells were then divided into seven FACS tubes
(BD Biosciences) at 2.5 · 105 cells per tube and stained
with PE-conjugated anti-CD31, -CD34, -CD73, -CD105,
-CD140b, and -IgG1k (BD Biosciences) and unstained.
Cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 4�C in the dark and
washed with 2% FBS in PBS solution. All data were ac-
quired using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed
using CellQuest (BD Biosciences) and Summit V4.3 soft-
ware (Dako). Expression was measured in comparison with

Results
DFU-derived fibroblasts can be reprogrammed
to iPSCs
iPSCs were derived using the CytoTune�-iPS 2.0 Sendai
Reprogramming Kit (Life Technologies) from three fibro-
blast cell types, including DFU-derived fibroblasts, non-
ulcerated site-matched DFFs, and nonulcerated site-matched
NFFs that were previously characterized (Maione et al.,
2015; Park et al., 2014) (Fig. 1A). Small, flat iPSC colonies
with sharp edges emerged after 2 weeks and demonstrated
cells with a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio. Colonies were
similar in appearance regardless of the origin of primary
fibroblasts from which they were derived (Fig. 1B).
To distinguish fully reprogrammed iPSC colonies from
partially reprogrammed iPSC colonies, we performed live
cell staining for two pluripotency-associated markers, TRA-
1-81 (BD Biosciences) and SSEA-4 (Millipore), as previ-
ously described (Chan et al., 2009; Lowry et al., 2008).
Figure 2 shows a phase-contrast image of a large fully re-
programmed colony that is positive for both surface markers,
TRA-1-81 (BD Biosciences) (green) and SSEA-4 (Millipore)
(red). Using live staining as a guide, colonies expressing both
Tra-1-81 (BD Biosciences) and SSEA-4 (Millipore) were
selected and passaged to generate iPSC subclones that were
designated iNFF, iDFF, and iDFU.
Overall, efficiencies for reprogramming using SeV in our
experiments ranged between 0.33% and 0.64% (Table 1)
and were similar for iPSCs reprogrammed from DFUs,
DFFs, or NFFs. The iNFF, iDFF, and iDFU subclones were
passed every 7–8 days, suggesting that they had acquired
similar growth properties.
DFU-derived iPSCs are pluripotent
and have a normal karyotype
iNFF, iDFF, and iDFU subclones were then fixed with 4%
PFA, stained for pluripotency-associated markers, SSEA-4
(Millipore), TRA-1-81 (BD Biosciences), and OCT4 (Ab-
cam), and counterstained with DAPI (Vector) to confirm
that they were fully reprogrammed. Figure 3 shows a rep-
resentative example of a phase-contrast image of fully re-
programmed colonies that are positive for both surface
markers, TRA-1-81 (BD Biosciences) (green) and SSEA-4
(Millipore) (red), as well as DAPI and OCT4 for all six
subclones. In contrast, feeder layers of mouse fibroblasts
were negative for immunohistochemical staining for plur-
ipotency markers (Takahashi et al., 2007).
Karyotypic analysis of derived iPSCs revealed that all
iNFF, iDFF, and iDFU subclones displayed normal diploid
karyotypes (Fig. 4). This karyotypic analysis establishes that
two independently derived iDFU subclones that originated
from two different patients resulted in a normal karyotype

 following reprogramming. This was also seen with two in-
dependent primary fibroblast lines reprogrammed from the
nonulcerated skin of healthy and diabetic patients.
Gene expression and pyrosequencing analyses reveal
induction of pluripotency-associated genes through
methylation and silencing of transgene expression
in iPSC subclones
Since expression and demethylation of promoters of criti-
cal pluripotency genes, such as OCT4 and NANOG, occur
upon reprogramming, we performed bisulfite pyrosequencing
to determine the extent of methylation at the OCT4 and
NANOG gene promoters on reprogrammed iPSC subclones
for iNFF, iDFF, and iDFU cell lines. DNA methylation
analysis revealed that CpG dinucleotides at the OCT4 and
NANOG promoter region were demethylated in iDFU25,
iDFF9, and iNFF12 subclones (Fig. 5A). This demonstrates
that specific CpG sites within NANOG and OCT4 promoters
were similarly demethylated regardless of patient history. In
spite of expression of the endogenous OCT4 and NANOG
genes in iPSCs, quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that
SeV genome was not detected in iNFF, iDFF, and iDFU cell
lines at late passages (Fig. 5B). This demonstrates that iPSC
subclones are not dependent upon exogenous reprogramming
transgenes to maintain their pluripotent state.
DFU-derived iPSCs form EBs and demonstrate normal
in vitro differentiation to the three embryonic germ layers
In vitro and in vivo differentiation potentials are the major
characteristics of iPSC lines (Takahashi et al., 2007). We
assayed the capacity of iPSC subclones to spontaneously
differentiate in vitro into all three germ layers by confirming
that iPSCs derived from iNFF, iDFF, and iDFU could form
EBs. When grown in EB cell culture medium on ultralow
adhesive culture plates, iNFF, iDFF, and iDFU cell lines
formed EBs within 2 days (Fig. 6A).
To determine their differentiation potential, we used EB
medium (Gerami-Naini et al., 2004) and specialized media
to direct cells toward endodermal, ectodermal, or meso-
dermal fates. Immunofluorescent staining of EBs generated
from iNFF, iDFF, and iDFU revealed expression of char-
acteristic markers for bIII-tubulin (ectodermal lineage), AFP
(endodermal lineage), and Vimentin (mesodermal lineage)
(Fig. 6B). This demonstrated that all iPSC subclones harbor
the potential for in vitro differentiation to all germ layers
following reprogramming, regardless of their origin.
DFU-derived iPSCs form teratomas in vivo
To test the pluripotency of iPSC clones in vivo, we per-
formed teratoma assays in SCID beige mice. Tumors

iPSCs from iDFUs can be differentiated
toward fibroblasts
Previously, we have demonstrated that iPSCs derived from
human foreskin fibroblasts can be differentiated into fibro-
blast-like cells (Hewitt et al., 2009). Using this same protocol,
we differentiated iPSCs derived from diabetic foot ulcer fi-
broblasts (iDFU25) into fibroblast-like cells. The resulting
cultures, titled iDFU25-Fib1, demonstrate fusiform mor-
phology indicative of mesenchymal fibroblasts (Fig. 8).
To further characterize these cells, flow cytometry analysis
was performed on DFU25 and iDFU25-Fib1. Expression of
mesenchymal fibroblast markers (CD37, CD105, CD140b)
was detected as being present in greater than 80% of the cells.
Endothelial markers (CD31, CD34) were not detected (Fig.
9A, B) (Hewitt et al., 2009).
Using qPCR, we determined that iDFU25-Fib1 also ex-
pressed mesenchymal markers, alpha smooth muscle actin
(ACTA2) (Fig. 9C) and Vimentin (Fig. 9D). Taken together,
these data indicate that iDFU25, a DFU-derived cell line, has
the potential to differentiate into a mesenchymal fibroblast.
Discussion
We have established the capacity to efficiently reprogram
fibroblasts from chronic nonhealing wounds from diabetic
patients to iPSCs for the first time. By screening and se-
lecting fully reprogrammed iPSC clones from multiple pri-
mary cell lines derived from diabetic patients, we provide
evidence that reprogramming of DFU cells can be achieved at
efficiencies of 0.34%–0.64%. In this study, we utilized SeV to
generate these iPSC lines without integrating reprogramming
transgenes. The use of this nonintegrating vector system
limits the risk for genomic insertions and lowers the likeli-
hood of tumorigenicity for future clinical use in regenerative
therapy. Indeed, we determined that exogenous reprogram-
ming transgenes were silenced and were not required to
maintain the pluripotent state.

 These studies demonstrate the feasibility of reprogram-
ming wound-derived fibroblasts from patients with type 2
diabetes to iPSCs as a first step toward developing strategies
to use them to treat these chronic wounds. We also dem-
onstrated the ability of the DFU-derived iPS cells to be
differentiated into mesenchymal fibroblasts. Further studies
may provide a detailed understanding of whether cellular
functions are activated upon differentiation of iPSCs that
may reverse wound fibroblasts from a nonhealing to a
healing-competent phenotype.
Reprogramming fibroblasts to pluripotency from primary
cells derived from DFUs establishes the feasibility of gener-
ating cells derived from complex disease sites. There are
many examples of reprogramming cell types derived from
patients with diseases harboring single gene defects (Zhang
et al., 2011). Our studies are the first to reprogram fibroblasts
from complex disease environments that manifest multiple
cellular defects that prevent cutaneous wound healing. Such
cells offer opportunities to learn which cellular functions and
regenerative potencies may be restored when cells are dif-
ferentiated into specific cell types from iPSCs.
Previously our laboratory reported that fibroblasts gen-
erated from iPSCs derived from foreskin-derived fibroblasts
showed phenotypic and functional features of human stro-
mal fibroblasts (Hewitt et al., 2009) and that these iPSC-
derived cells could accelerate epithelial tissue regeneration
(Shamis et al., 2011). Future studies will allow us to de-
termine if expression of genes critical to wound repair, an-
giogenesis, and ECM assembly (Maione et al., 2015; Park
et al., 2014), which may be abnormal in DFUs, could be
normalized after reprogramming to iPSC and subsequent
differentiation to fibroblast lineage.
Previous studies have demonstrated that human iPSCs
have been derived from diabetic patients. iPSCs have been
reprogrammed from fibroblasts derived from patients with
MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young) for use as
in vitro disease models and to explore defects in pancreatic
beta cell function and in pancreas and kidney development
(Teo et al., 2013). Recently, iPSCs have been generated from
fibroblasts derived from patients with insulin receptor muta-
tions to study the genetic basis of insulin resistance in patients
with severe insulin resistance due to mutations in the insulin
receptor gene (Iovino et al., 2014). We extend these findings
by demonstrating that wound-derived fibroblasts from dia-
betic patients can be reprogrammed with similar properties to
those derived from site-matched fibroblasts from healthy skin
from diabetic and nondiabetic subjects.
Reprogramming fibroblasts directly from chronic diabetic
wound environments provides opportunities to modify the
epigenetic profile of these patient-derived fibroblasts for
future therapeutic benefits. For example, large-scale epige-
netic remodeling, which is known to occur during repro-
gramming to iPSC (Hewitt et al., 2011), may reverse disease
processes under epigenetic control in DFU-derived fibro-
blasts. Epigenetic remodeling is particularly significant for
treating diabetic wounds since metabolic memory, cellular
changes induced by hyperglycemia and sustained after return
to a normal glycemic state, is regulated by histone modifica-
tions (El-Osta et al., 2008; Pirola et al., 2010). These changes
alter the expression of genes linked to diabetic complications,
including impaired wound responses. Thus, wound fibroblasts
reprogrammed to iPSCs offer a powerful model to explore how
programs of gene expression linked to the nonhealing pheno-
type may be shifted to a regenerative phenotype upon the
subsequent differentiation of iPSCs to fibroblasts.
Such epigenetic modification could improve the function
of diabetic fibroblasts and may reveal controls of genes
linked to diabetic complications to offer new ways to study
and improve their repair. This could include the capacity to
derive a range of cell types from iPSCs originating from
diabetic patients to treat diabetic complications at other
tissue sites as well.
In summary, we demonstrate that DFU patient-derived fi-
broblasts can be efficiently reprogrammed to iPSCs and dif-
ferentiated into fibroblasts. This will lay the groundwork for
therapeutic use ofthese cells directlyinthe wound bed thatmay
correct cellular repair defects. This will mark a significant
departure from the status quo of DFU therapies that will lead
the wound repair field to the threshold of novel treatments
using autologous cells derived from iPSCs to dramatically
improve healing in ways that will significantly reduce long-
term care for patients suffering from these conditions.
