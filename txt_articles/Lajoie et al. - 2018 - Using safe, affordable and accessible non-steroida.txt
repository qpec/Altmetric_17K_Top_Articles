Abstract
Introduction: At its basic level, HIV infection requires a replication-competent virus and a susceptible target cell. Elevated levels of
vaginal inflammation has been associated with the increased risk of HIV infection as it brings highly activated HIV target cells
(CCR5+CD4+ T cells; CCR5+CD4+CD161+ Th17 T cells) to the female genital tract (FGT) where they interact with HIV.
Decreased HIV risk has been associated with a phenotype of decreased immune activation, called immune quiescence, described
among Kenyan female sex workers who were intensely exposed to HIV yet remain uninfected. Current prevention approaches
focus on limiting viral access. We took the novel HIV prevention approach of trying to limit the number of HIV target cells in the gen-
ital tract by reducing inflammation using safe, affordable and globally accessible anti-inflammatory drugs.
Methods: We hypothesized that the daily administration of low doses of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA 81 mg) or hydroxychloro-
quine (HCQ 200 mg) would reduce inflammation thereby decreasing HIV target cells at the FGT. Low-risk HIV seronegative
women from Nairobi, Kenya were randomized for six weeks therapy of ASA (n = 37) or HCQ (n = 39) and tested to deter-
mine the impact on their systemic and mucosal immune environment.
Results: The results showed that HCQ use was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of systemic T cells
that were CCR5+CD4+ (p = 0.01) and Th17 (p = 0.01). In the ASA arm, there was a 35% and 28% decrease in the proportion
of genital T cells that were CD4+CCR5+ (p = 0.017) and Th17 (p = 0.04) respectively. Proteomic analyses of the cervical
lavage showed ASA use was associated with significantly reduced amount of proteins involved in the inflammatory response
and cell recruitment at the mucosa, although none of the individual proteins passed multiple comparison correction. These
changes were more apparent in women with Lactobacillus dominant microbiomes.
Conclusion: Together, these data indicate that taking low-dose ASA daily was associated with significant reduction in HIV tar-
get cells at the FGT. This study provides proof-of-concept for a novel HIV-prevention approach that reducing inflammation
using safe, affordable and globally accessible non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents is associated with significant reduction in
the proportion of HIV-target cells at the FGT.

INTRODUCTION
Despite efforts to increase the access to prevention pro-
grammes, there are over 1.5 million new HIV infections
annually [1]. In Africa, it is estimated that women have a
twofold greater risk for HIV acquisition during unprotected
vaginal intercourse compared with men [1], and female sex
workers (FSW) are 13.5 times more likely to become HIV
infected compared to other women [2]. Therefore, develop-
ing new HIV prevention methods that would empower
women
to
protect
themselves
is
a
priority
for
public
health.

 One of the biological factors most strongly associated with
increased HIV risk is the presence of inflammation prior to
HIV exposure. The presence of sexually transmitted infections
(STIs) and diverse bacterial communities during bacterial vagi-
nosis are associated with increased risk of HIV infection [3].
Diverse vaginal bacterial communities are thought to increase
HIV risk through mechanisms including immune activation (IA),
recruitment of HIV target cells [4], as well as damage to
epithelial barriers [5]. The CAPRISA 004 study showed that
women with greater IA were at higher risk of HIV acquisition
regardless of study arm [6], which is likely linked to the pres-
ence of dysbiotic bacteria that metabolize tenofovir, rendering
it ineffective [7].
Our group showed that decreased risk of HIV infection
among the Pumwani Sex Worker Cohort from Kenya was
associated with an immune phenotype called immune quies-
cence (IQ) [8]. This phenotype is characterized by lower base-
line level of T cell IA [9] and pro-inflammatory chemokines
[10] which decreases the number of HIV target cells (CCR5+
CD4+ T cells) at the genital tract [11].
With the goal of reducing HIV-target cells at the genital
tract, we sought to reduce inflammation and induce the IQ
phenotype using a pharmacological approach. The criteria for
the anti-inflammatory drugs chosen were that they had to be
FDA-approved with a long safety track record, affordable and
widely accessible in all parts of the world. We conducted a
pilot study in Kenya with the objectives of assessing if the
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)
or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could reduce T cell IA, HIV tar-
get cell numbers and inflammation at the genital tract.

METHODS
2.1
|
Study design and participants
Inducing IQ (IIQ) study was a randomized pilot, open-label
study conducted at the Pumwani Maternity and Baba Dogo
community clinics located in Nairobi, Kenya. We enrolled 91
HIV uninfected women who were from the general commu-
nity, that is not commercial sex workers, with 39 and 37 com-
pleting the study in the HCQ and ASA arms respectively
(Figure 1). Both the University of Nairobi and the University
of Manitoba ethical review boards approved this study and
participants provided written informed consent.
2.2
|
STI screening
At the screening visit and each study visit, vulvovaginal swab
was collected to determine the presence of candida pseudohy-
phae, bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginalis. Urine
samples were collected for PCR detection of Neisseria gonor-
rhoea and Chlamydia trachomatis (Roche Amplicor kits, Indiana-
polis, IN, USA). Syphilis testing was performed at screening
visit, all women were tested negative. HIV serology using a
rapid test (Determine, Inverness Medical, Japan) was per-
formed at the first and last study visit.
2.3

Study procedures
Participants were randomized to receive either oral ASA
(81 mg) (Bayer Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada) or HCQ
(200 mg) (Sanofi Aventis, Paris, France) once a day for a per-
iod of six weeks. Participants were pre-screened for STIs
including HIV. Participants were followed up for a total of
12 weeks (four pre-drug, six on drug, two post-drug) with
sampling occurring monthly. Women not on depot medrox-
yprogesterone acetate (DMPA) were asked to come 5 to
8 days after the end of menstrual bleeding to ensure that all
mucosal samples were taken during the follicular phase of the
cycle. Visit 1 was the pre-drug visit and visit 3 was following
six weeks on drug therapy.

Adverse events
Of the participants randomized to the ASA arm (n = 37), the
drug was well tolerated at the week two visit with 35 partici-
pants (92%) having no adverse events. Three reported minor
adverse events (one experienced headache and abdominal dis-
comfort in the first four days of taking the drug; one reported
epigastric pain, abdominal fullness and heartburn. While the
third did not specify what type of adverse event they had).
After six weeks of taking ASA, the majority of participants 33
(86%) did not report an adverse event. Five participants
reported an effect (two indicated nausea, one of joint pains
for five days, one of coughing while one did not specify). Only
one participant indicated an effect at both follow-up visits.
Among the HCQ-randomized participants (n = 38), 32 (84%)
did not experience any side effect. Six reported experiencing a
side effect at the two-week follow-up visit. The side effects
reported at visit 2 were headache (four participants), nausea
(one participant), dizziness and stomach ache (one participant).
After six weeks of HCQ, 26 (68%) of the participants indicated
they did not experience any adverse event. Twelve participants
reported mild adverse events including abdominal pain (three
participants), dizziness (two participants), throat pain (one partic-
ipant), skin rash (two participants), loss of appetite (one partici-
pant) and boils (one participant). Three participants indicated
having a side effect at both visit 2 and visit 3 follow ups. One par-
ticipant indicated that she did not take the drug daily as per the
study protocol because of throat pain.

Sample collection and processing
Blood, cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) and cervical mononuclear
cells (CMC), collected by cytobrush, were obtained from all
participants at visit 1 (baseline) and visit 3. CVL was collected
first followed by cervical cytobrushes as in Juno et al. [12].
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by
Ficoll density gradient.

PBMC and CMC flow cytometry
PBMC (106) and CMC were washed with 2% FBS-19 PBS
and stained with PE.Cy5-CD3, FITC-CD4, PE-CD95, APC.
H7-HLA-DR, APC-CD161, V450-CCR5, PE.Cy7-CD69 (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), and Far Red-Live Dead dis-
criminant (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Data were acquired
on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD BioSciences) and analysed
using FlowJo v10.0.8r1 (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA). Cytoki-
nes and chemokines in the blood were detected by Millipore
micro-bead array assay for the following cytokines (IFN-c, IL-
10, IL-12p70, IL-15, sCD40L, IL-17A, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-8,

Proteome and microbiome analysis
Mass spectrometry was utilized to characterize both human
and microbial proteins as described previously [7,13]. Briefly,
100 lg of protein from each sample were digested with tryp-
sin and analysed by tandem mass spectrometry using an Orbi-
trap
Velos
mass
spectrometer
(ThermoFisher
Scientific,
Waltman, MA, USA). Human peptide identity searching was
performed using Mascot Daemon v2.4.0 (Matrix Science Inc.,
Boston, MA, USA) against the SwissProt database restricting
taxonomy to Human. Bacterial peptide identity searches were
performed using a manually curated TrEMBL database con-
taining the major identified genera identified from an initial
search
(17
genera

4,206,764
proteins

(see
Appendix S1 for additional details).

Statistical analysis
The analyses performed for this pilot study included assess-
ment of the difference in T cell IA between baseline and visit
3. The primary outcome was the assessment of HIV target
cells, defined as CD4+CCR5+CD3+ and CD4+CD161+CCR5+,
and their activation phenotype (CD69+). The study was not
designed to compare between the two drug arms. In the
analysis, the v2 test was used to assess the significance of
the associations between categorical variable using Prism 6.0f
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) and Gaussian distribu-
tion was tested by Shapiro-Wilk normality test and normality
plot using SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). See Appendix S1
for details on which factor were normally distributed. To com-
pare baseline to visit 3, two-tailed paired T test or Wilcoxon
matched-pair signed-rank test were performed. Using SSPS,
multivariate linear regressions were built to determine if hor-
monal contraception and age impacted the change score of
the
intercept
(visit
3-baseline).
Pearson
correlation
or
Spearman’s rank test were used for correlations between
continuous variables. Generalized linear models were per-
formed with the stats package in R (version 3.3.1) to
determine
interactions
effects
between
study
treatment
and microbiome state on protein expression (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Viennna, Austria). As this was a
discovery study, p values were considered significant if
≤0.05. The study was monitored by a Data and Safety
Monitoring
Board
derived
from
University
of
Manitoba
experts.
The
study
is
registered
on
ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT02079077). Participants who were discontinued from
the study were excluded from the analysis.

RESULTS
3.1
|
Participant characteristics
A total of 91 women (Figure 1) were enrolled in the study
and followed up between May and December 2014. In total,
76 women completed all the study visits; (39 in the HCQ arm
and 37 in the ASA arm). All the women remained HIV
seronegative at follow-up testing at the end of the study. Par-
ticipant characteristics at entry were similar between the
study arms (Table 1).

IA/inflammation
Systemic and mucosal T cell IA was assessed on fresh cells by
flow cytometry, while inflammatory state was determined by
measuring cytokine and chemokine proteins. The results pre-
sented herein compare IA after six weeks on drugs (visit 3)
with baseline (visit 1).

HCQ arm
3.3.1
|
Systemic HCQ analysis
At visit 3, 33/36 participants had detectable HCQ in the
blood (mean 37.08 ng/mL) and 19/36 participants had detect-
able levels in CVL (mean 18,45 ng/mL). There were not
enough biological samples to test three participants.
In the HCQ arm, the systemic level of two pro-inflamma-
tory
chemokines
IP-10
(p = 0.03)
and
IL-2Ra
(p = 0.02)
(Figure 2A)
were
significantly
decreased
following
HCQ
administration. We observed that there was a significant
increase in the proportion of systemic T cells that were CD4+
(p = 0.003) but a significant reduction in the proportion of
HIV target cells (defined as CD4+CCR5+CD3+) (p = 0.01)
and Th17 (CD4+CD161+CCR5+) (p = 0.01) as well as lower
proportion of activated Th17 cells (CD4+CD161+CD69+)
(p < 0.0001). The intensity of expression of HIV co-receptor
CCR5 on a per cell basis, called mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI), trended to be lower on CD4+ T cells (p = 0.051) and
was significantly reduced on Th17 T-cells (p = 0.015). Follow-
ing six weeks of HCQ treatment, the intensity of expression
of CD69 was significantly lower (p = 0.03 on CD4+ and
p = 0.0003 on Th17) (Figure 2B). There was no significant
correlation between the blood level of HCQ and the level of
T cell IA markers.
As age and use of contraception are two factors that can
influence IA, we performed multivariate linear regression to
determine if the variations observed in the HCQ arm were
influenced by either age or DMPA use. In our linear regres-
sion model, we observed that age influenced the proportion of
CD4+ (p = 0.003), CD4+CCR5+ (0.01) and CD4+CD161+
CCR5+ (p = 0.021) and the expression of CD69 on CD4+ T
cells (p = 0.015) and CD4+CD161+ (0.001), while DMPA had
an impact on the proportion of CD4+CD161+CD69+ T cells
(p = 0.01) (data not shown). Only the expression of CCR5 on
CD4+ T cells was not affected by age and DMPA as con-
founding factors. Due to the limitation of our study design
and sample size, it is impossible to determine if the impact of
age on the level of IA is stronger than the HCQ-effect.
3.3.2
|
Mucosal HCQ analysis
At the mucosal compartment, we did not observe any signifi-
cant difference in the expression of cytokines/chemokines
between baseline and visit 3. As observed in the blood, the
proportion of T cells that were CD4+ was higher at visit 3
compared with baseline (p = 0.018). The proportion of Th17
cells expressing CCR5 (CD4+CD161+CCR5+) was signifi-
cantly decreased at visit 3 (p = 0.011). The intensity of
expression of the HIV co-receptor CCR5 and the early activa-
tion/tissue residence marker CD69 were also reduced at visit
3 (p = 0.01 and p = 0.046 respectively) (Figure 3).
In the multivariate analysis, age affected the proportion of
CD4+ (p = 0.008) and CD4+CD161+CCR5+ (p = 0.002). Nei-
ther age nor contraception affected the expression of CD69.

Proteomics/microbiome in HCQ arm
A total of 401 unique human proteins were consistently iden-
tified in all CVL included in this study. Seventeen (4.2%) pro-
teins were differentially abundant after six weeks of HCQ
treatment compared with baseline levels (p < 0.05, paired
t-test, Table S1). Based on the distribution of p-values from
this data, we are unable to discern whether or not this study
observed a true effect or if the results are due to random
chance (Figure S1A,B). Proteins altered included increased
levels of epithelial barrier proteins (TGM3, PPL, KRT1, CRNN,
ACTN4) and decreased levels of immune response proteins
(IGHG1, ELANE, ORM2, PGLYRP1). Ingenuity pathway analy-
sis demonstrated that cell death (p = 0.0077, z = �2.04), the
inflammatory response (p = 0.00913, z = �1.154), cell move-
ment
of
leukocytes
(p = 0.009,
z = �1.12)
and
necrosis
(p = 0.023, z = �1.02) functions were all found at lower
levels post-HCQ treatment (Table S2).
Mass spectrometry analysis identified 341 unique bacterial
proteins belonging to 12 unique genera, and bacterial propor-
tions are shown in Figure 4A. Samples belonged to two major
groups, with bacterial communities dominated by Lactobacillus
(n = 29, 42%) or non-Lactobacillus taxa (n = 40, 58%) (>50%
by proportion). Women with non-Lactobacillus communities

(Figure 4B).

ASA arm
3.4.1
|
Systemic ASA analysis
ASA was detected in the plasma of 33/35 participants (mean
111.3 ng/mL) and in the CVL of 28/35 women (mean 46.14 ng/
mL). The two participants with undetectable plasma levels had
also undetectable CVL, likely indicating non-compliance with
taking the drug. We were unable to assess ASA concentration
for three participants due to a lack of sample material.
In the plasma, the level of monocyte chemoattractant pro-
tein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) was significantly decreased following six
weeks on ASA (p = 0.03). There was an increased proportion
of T cells expressing CD4+ compared with baseline (p = 0.03)
and a significant decrease of Th17 cells (CD4+CD161+) that
were of an activated phenotype (CD69+) (p = 0.02). Expres-
sion of CCR5 and CD69 on CD4+Tcells was also significantly
lower
compared
with
baseline
(p = 0.01
and
p = 0.003
respectively) (Figure 5A).
A multivariate regression analysis showed that neither age
nor contraception impacted any of the changes observed
between baseline and visit 3, suggesting the changes were
likely directly due to ASA use.
The blood level of ASA concentration was negatively corre-
lated with the proportion of HIV target cells (CD4+CCR5+)
(p < 0.0001) but positively correlated with the intensity of
expression of CCR5 on CD4+ T cells (p < 0.0001) and pro-
portion of Th17 cells (p = 0.02) (Figure 5B).
3.4.2
|
Mucosal ASA analysis
At the mucosal compartment following six weeks of ASA
therapy, we observed significant reductions in the proportions
of CD3+T cells (p = 0.01), Th17 (p = 0.04) and HIV target
cells (CD4+CCR5+, p = 0.017; and CD4+CD161+CCR5+, p =
0.03) relative to baseline (Figure 6A).
Multivariate linear regression modelling showed that nei-
ther age nor contraceptive use affected the changes observed
suggesting the effects were ASA-associated.
We performed a correlation analysis to determine if the
concentration of ASA had an impact on the IA observed at
the female genital tract (FGT). The only marker that corre-
lated with the systemic level of ASA was the expression of
CCR5 on CD4+ Tcells. We also observed that the mucosal
ASA concentration was inversely correlated with the propor-
tion of HIV target cells at the FGT (p < 0.0001) demonstrat-
ing that higher mucosal level of ASA resulted in fewer HIV
target cells at the genital tract (Figure 6B).

Levels of mucosal HIV target cells in ASA
treatment compared to HIV-exposed seronegative
women
Levels of mucosal CCR5+CD4+ T cells in low risk women
from the general community in Nairobi declined significantly
following six weeks of ASA therapy which itself was signifi-
cantly higher than levels in HIV-exposed seronegative (HESN)

Proteomics of host proteins in the ASA arm
Proteomic analysis of the ASA arm showed that after six
weeks of ASA use, 46 (11.4%) human proteins were differen-
tially abundant compared with baseline (p < 0.05, paired
t-test, Table S3, Figure 8A). A true effect was likely observed
in this comparison as the distribution of p-values below 0.05
are more than would be expected by random chance (Fig-
ure S1C,D). Hierarchical clustering showed these proteins
separated baseline from post-ASA treatment (visit 3) into two
major branches (Figure 9). Proteins clustering with ASA treat-

with ASA treatment could largely be attributed to LD women,
whereas treatment in non-LD women appeared to have no
effect on protein expression. A true effect was likely observed
in this comparison as the distribution of p-values below 0.05
are more than would be expected by random chance (Fig-

DISCUSSION
It has been well established that heterosexual HIV transmis-
sion is actually an infrequent event on a per sex act basis
[14]. The basic elements of transmission are a replication-com-
petent virus and a susceptible host cell. Most of the current
biomedical prevention approaches focus on either keeping
HIV away (condom use) or neutralizing it once it is present in
the genital mucosa (PrEP, microbicides, vaccines). However,
trying to limit the availability of susceptible HIV-target cells at
the genital tract, as a means of reducing HIV risk, has not
been attempted. It is known that inflammation brings acti-
vated T cells to the site of irritation. Activated CD4+ T lym-
phocytes are more susceptible to HIV infection than quiescent

 cells and, once infected, produce up to 1000 times more virus
[15]. In this study, we show that taking low-dose HCQ for six
weeks was associated with a lower systemic IA, while low-
dose ASA consumption was associated with decreased sys-
temic and mucosal HIV target cells.
ASA (81 mg) and HCQ (200 mg) were selected as they have
both been used for long-term prevention of chronic conditions
with excellent safety records and were deemed acceptable and
non-stigmatizing in community consultations. Long-term oral
consumption of HCQ is clinically administered to control inflam-
mation in autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis
[16]. Low-dose ASA, commonly used to decrease risk of heart
disease [17,18] and it decreases inflammation through decreas-
ing the production of prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 [19],
however, its action on T cell IA is unknown.
Due to the strong community engagement, for those that
completed the study we observed an overall adherence rate
of 93% (92% for the HCQ arm and 94% for the ASA) as
determined by blood levels of drug. A novel observation was
that both drugs were detected in the genital tract, with ASA
having the better mucosal distribution.
Our findings indicate that a six-week treatment of HCQ is
associated with increased percentages of circulating CD4+ T
cells, but overall those cells had lower levels of markers of IA
(Figure 2). This supports a study from Piconi et al., who showed
that higher dose of daily administered HCQ (400 mg) in HIV-
infected individuals had a notable reduction on IA and led to
higher levels of regulatory T cells and lower T cell and monocyte
activation [20]. In our study among those taking HCQ, there
was a 31% decrease in HIV target cells in the blood. At the geni-
tal tract, there was a 11% decrease in the density of the HIV
co-receptor CCR5 on CD4+ T cells, although the proportion of
HIV target cells did not significantly decrease (Figure 3). The
multivariate regression analysis performed for the HCQ arm
showed the systemic and mucosal immune variations were con-
founded by age. The differences observed are most likely due to
drug consumption, however, because of small sample size and
study design we cannot exclude that different age groups might
be affected differently by the study drug. HCQ treatment had
no effect on the make-up of the microbiome.
In
participants
who
received
ASA
for
six
weeks,
we
observed decreased IA in the blood and mucosa. At the sys-
temic environment, we observed lower levels of MCP-1.
MCP-1 is a chemokine associated with inflammation and plays
an important role in trafficking of monocytes and memory T
cells [21]. At the cellular level, we observed a lower propor-
tion of activated Th17 cells in the blood after ASA treatment
(Figure 5A). Interestingly, the intensity of expression of CCR5
was also decreased and this was negatively correlated with
the concentration of ASA in the blood. At the genital tract,

No proteins passed multiple comparison correction. Proteins in blue were significantly decreased post-treatment and those in red were
increased. Functional annotation of proteins found in major clusters were assigned using Consensus PathDB. Major microbiome profiles
(Lactobacillus dominant or non-Lactobacillus dominant) are indicated at the top of the heat map.

 ASA consumption was associated with a decrease in the pro-
portion of HIV target cells by 35% and Th17 cells by 28%
(Figure 6A). It is not known if this decline would be sufficient
to have an impact on HIV susceptibility, however, it does
approach the level of HIV target cells found in HESN sex
workers from Nairobi who display the immune quiescent phe-
notype (Figure 7). Whether a longer duration of ASA treat-
ment would reduce the numbers of HIV target cells even
further is not known. We detected ASA in the CVL of most
participants (80%). Mucosal ASA concentration negatively cor-
related with the proportion of CCR5+CD4+ HIV target cells
(Figure 6B). Interestingly, using a comprehensive systems biol-
ogy assessment of human and bacterial proteins, we showed
that although ASA use was not associated with a change in
the microbiome, it was associated with a reduction in the
quantity of host mucosal proteins involved in the inflammatory
response and increased barriers function proteins, particularly
in women with a Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal microbiome
(Figure 10). This suggests that ASA use may be associated
with protection against HIV by decreasing inflammation as
well as tightening the junction between epithelial cells making
free virion migration into tissue more difficult. It also suggests
that the microbiome may be an important determinant in
pharmacological approaches to controlling inflammation.

Limitations
As with any study, we acknowledge the limitations of this
study.
Although we did detect and control for many STIs and vagi-
nal
infections
(HIV,
candida,
BV,
trichomonas
vaginalis,
gonorrhoea, chlamydia and syphilis), as we did not measure
active herpes simplex virus infection status in this cohort, we
were not able to control for its potential confounding effects.
As the proteomic aspect of this study was intended to be a
hypothesis generating discovery study, we evaluated hundreds
of proteins. Therefore, when we corrected for multiple com-
parisons, none of the identified proteins remained significant.
Any correlations observed must be confirmed in focused fol-
low-up studies.
It should be noted that not all individuals responded concor-
dantly with the majority of those in the study. Although our
study is under-powered to directly address this issue, one
could speculate that these discordant findings may be because
some individuals experienced unreported infections, or were
under stress, or fatigued, or had other environmental factors
that affected their immune responses or their microbiome. We
know that some of the participants did not take the drug as it
was not detected in their blood, therefore their responses are
likely to be discordant. It is also possible that for a subset of
individuals their genetic background results in a decreased
response to the drug. Larger follow-up studies that have suffi-
cient power to accommodate intra-participant variation and
that incorporate whole genome analysis should be designed to
determine if there is a subset of people for whom this reduc-
ing inflammation/IIQ approach would not work.
Our study design did not include a placebo control arm.
While this did limit the analyses that were available, we felt
that as women vary in their baseline IA level, comparing each
woman to herself before drug was biologically the best com-
parison and this was our first priority. Future studies should
be higher powered and include a placebo-control arm.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we showed that taking low-dose HCQ and
ASA was associated with a significant decrease in the propor-
tion of HIV target cells in the blood and genital tract, respec-
tively. We showed that ASA treatment was associated with
an increase in the expression of protein involved in epithelial
barrier while not altering the bacterial community. More
studies are needed to understand the durability of the
effects on target cell levels, determine optimal dosage and
assess whether a similar impact on HIV target cell distribu-
tion can be observed in high-risk FSW before moving on to
an efficacy trial assessing HIV incidence. If reducing inflam-
mation is proven to reduce HIV risk, it would be a new
option
for
HIV
prevention. There
is
no
one-size-fits-all
approach to HIV prevention and it is clear that IIQ would
not be the first method of prevention for everyone. While
PrEP has tremendous potential for preventing HIV infections,
it must be accepted by the community. In the sex worker
cohort in Nairobi, we have seen that only 7% of high-risk
women offered PrEP were still taking it 12 months later.
Work needs to be done to increase the acceptance of PrEP
but clearly, other options that are acceptable to the commu-
nity are needed. Our work with community suggests that
anti-inflammatory drugs would be highly acceptable. There
may also be beneficial effects of using PrEP along with an
anti-inflammatory drug. A recent study from McKinnon et al.
showed that genital inflammation among African women using
anti-HIV drug tenofovir in a vaginal gel reduced the effective-
ness of the HIV prevention approach from 57% to 3% [22].
If vaginal inflammation can be reduced it may actually aid
other prevention approaches. At the recent International
AIDS Society 2017 meeting in Paris, there was recognition
that HIV prevention efforts, much like therapy, should include
a cocktail of approaches, tailored to each person. For some
individuals, using non-stigmatizing anti-inflammatory drugs, in
addition to other HIV prevention approaches, may be an
important addition to their HIV prevention tool kit.
