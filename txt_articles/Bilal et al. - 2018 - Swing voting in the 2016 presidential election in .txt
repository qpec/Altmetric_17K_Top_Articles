ABSTRACT 
Understanding the effects of widespread disruption of the social fabric on 
public health outcomes can provide insight into the forces that drive major 
political realignment. Our objective was to estimate the association between 
increases in mortality in middle-aged non-Hispanic white adults from 1999-
2005 to 2009-2015, health inequalities in life expectancy by income, and the 
surge in support for the Republican Party in pivotal US counties in the 2016 
presidential election. We conducted a longitudinal ecological study in 2764 
US counties from 1999 to 2016. Increases in mortality were measured using 
age-specific (45-54 years of age) all-cause mortality from 1999-2005 to 
2009-2015 at the county level. Support for the Republican Party was 
measured as the party’s vote share in the presidential election in 2016 
adjusted for results in 2008 and 2012. We found a significant up-turn in 
mortality from 1999-2005 to 2009-2015 in counties where the Democratic 
Party won twice (2008 and 2012) but where the Republican Party won in 
2016 (+10.7/100,000), as compared to those in which the Democratic Party 
won in 2016 (-15.7/100,000). An increase in mortality of 15.2/100,000 was 
associated with a significant (p<0.001) 1% vote swing from the 2008-2012 
average to 2016. We also found that counties with wider health inequalities 
in life expectancy were more likely to vote Republican in 2016, regardless of 
the previous voting patterns. Counties with worsening premature mortality 
in the last 15 years and wider health inequalities shifted votes toward the 
 3 
 
Republican Party presidential candidate. Further understanding of causes of 
unanticipated deterioration in health in the general population can inform 
social policy.

INTRODUCTION 
In 2015 Case and Deaton reported an increase in the mortality rate of 
middle-aged non-Hispanic white Americans(Case and Deaton, 2015). From 
1999 to 2013 an increase in all-cause mortality of 33.9 per 100,000 was 
observed among non-Hispanic whites, while a decrease was observed among 
other racial/ethnic groups. This increase was concentrated among non-
Hispanic whites without a college degree, where mortality increased by 
134.4 per 100,000. A more recent analysis by the same authors highlighted 
the increasing inequalities in mortality by level of education in non-Hispanic 
white Americans(Case and Deaton, 2017). 
Media coverage of the 2016 US presidential election highlighted the electoral 
platform that the Republican presidential candidate built around non-college 
educated whites(Norris, 2016). Early post-election analyses in particular 
have highlighted the role this group played in the Republican victory in 
crucial swing states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio(Tankersley, 
2016). Further analyses in the months following the election have described 
several correlates of the shift in voting, namely: (1) changes in trade and 
imports(Autor et al., 2016); (2) changes in economic distress(Monnat, 
2016), well-being(Rocha et al., 2017) and social hardship(Rothwell and 
Diego-Rosell, 2016); (3) presence of a higher proportion of working class 
people(Monnat, 2016) and other demographic features(Rothwell and Diego-
Rosell, 2016; Weinhold, 2017); and (4) higher inequality(Weinhold, 2017).

In summary, a series of economic and social conditions and associated 
inequality seemed to have fueled, at least in part, the shift in voting 
patterns. 
A number of analyses of the potential causes of the increase in mortality in 
non-college educated non-Hispanic whites have highlighted the role of 
economic inequality(Chetty et al., 2016), disparities in health behaviors by 
class(Schroeder, 2016), and a constrained welfare state(Beckfield and 
Bambra, 2016). Taking a different approach, we looked at the consequences 
of this health crisis using increasing mortality as an indicator of social and 
economic upheaval at the county level. Two other analyses have been 
recently published, in which an increase in ‘deaths of despair’ due to drug 
and alcohol poisonings and suicides(Monnat, 2016) and decreases in life 
expectancy at birth(Bor, 2017) have been linked to over performance of the 
Republican candidate in the 2016 election as compared to the 2012 and 
2008 elections. In summary, worsening health conditions are associated with 
a shift in voting patterns towards the Republican party in 2016. 
Building on these two phenomena, we start with the framework outlined in 
Figure 1. We test whether health outcomes and health inequality are 
associated with a shift in voting patterns. We hypothesize that counties 
with an increase in mortality rates in midlife adults and the widest health 
inequalities by income are loci of social and economic disruption, and 
 6 
 
therefore more likely to vote for a candidate who promises a dramatic shift 
in policy.

METHODS 
Health data 
We obtained all-cause age-specific mortality from two periods for non-
Hispanic white adults aged 45-49 and 50-54 from the CDC WONDER 
Detailed Mortality files(NCHS, 2016). To avoid suppressed death counts due 
to low numbers we pooled 7 year estimates: the first period includes data 
from 1999 to 2005 while the second period spans from 2009 to 2015 To 
address potential age-aggregation bias(Gelman and Auerbach, 2016) we 
averaged mortality rates in people aged 45-49 and 50-54 to create an age-
adjusted mortality rate for people aged 45-54. To estimate increases in 
mortality by county, we subtracted the mortality rate in the first period 
(1999-2005) from the rate in the second period (2009-2015). A positive 
number indicates an increase in mortality between these periods.  
We also obtained data for health inequalities by income from the Health 
Inequality project by Chetty et al(Chetty et al., 2016). This study collected 
data using social security and death records, and estimated inequalities by 
income quartile (Q1-4) for counties with a population > 25,000 for the 
period 2001 to 2014. We used two measures of health inequality: an 
absolute measure, computed as Life Expectancy (LE) of Q4 (richest) – LE of 
Q1 (poorest); and a relative measure, computed as LE of Q4 / LE of Q1.

Election data 
We obtained US presidential election results by county for the years 2000, 
from the Federal Elections Project(Lublin and Voss, 2001); 2008 and 2012 
from data.gov(U.S. General Services Administration, 2016); and for 2016 
from the US Election Atlas(Leip, 2016).  Each election dataset contains 
information on total number of votes cast and number of votes cast for the 
Democratic (Gore, Obama or Clinton) or the Republican (Bush, McCain, 
Romney or Trump) candidate. To measure increased support for Trump in 
2016 (as compared to the performance of the Republican Party in previous 
elections) we classified counties by the number of times the Democratic 
Party won in the 2008 and 2012 elections, and then further classified these 
into counties carried by the Republican or Democratic Party in 2016. We also 
calculated “vote swing” by subtracting the difference in votes between 
parties (% Democratic - % Republican) in 2008-2012 from 2016. A negative 
number represents increased support for Trump.  
Statistical analysis 
To estimate the association between the increases in mortality from the first 
(1999-2005) to the second period (2009-2015) and shifts in voting patterns, 
we calculated the average weighted by the population in each county in 
2012 of the mortality increases by the six categories described above 
(Democratic win in 0 elections, 1 election or 2 elections in 2008 and 2012, 
by Democratic or Republican win in 2016). We also estimated the 
 9 
 
association between the vote swing between elections and the change in 
mortality between the two periods using a linear mixed model with a random 
intercept for the state. We had a total of 2764 counties with complete voting 
and mortality data.  
To estimate the association between health inequalities by income and shifts 
in voting patterns, we performed an analysis similar to the one above. We 
computed the weighted average of the absolute health inequalities by 
income (Q4 vs Q1) in the six categories of election result. We also estimated 
the association between the vote swing between elections and absolute and 
health inequalities using a linear mixed model with a random intercept for 
state. This analysis was only conducted in 1552 counties were data for 
inequalities was available. 
We performed several sensitivity analyses. First, we checked whether our 
inferences were robust to the restriction of the sample to the six states 
where the Democratic Party won in 2012 but shifted to the Republican Party 
in 2016 (Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). 
Second, we looked at election results in 2000 and 2008 (instead of 2008 and 
2012) to check whether our results were robust in elections with no 
incumbent. Third, we checked whether our results were robust to the use of 
mortality data for all races (instead of only non-Hispanic Whites). Fourth, 
 10 
 
regarding the analysis of health inequalities and voting patterns, we also 
computed the results using the relative measure of inequality. 
Patient Involvement 
No patients were involved in the design, analysis or interpretation of this 
ecological study.

RESULTS 
Table 1 shows the number of counties in each category of results in the 
2008, 2012 and 2016 elections with complete mortality data for 1999-2005 
and 2009-2015. Most counties remained either Democrat (n=417) or 
Republican (n=1945) through the three elections. A number of counties 
switched from Democrat to Republican in the 2012 election (n=176) or the 
2016 election (n=190).  
As shown in Table 2 the average increase in mortality from 1999-2005 to 
2009-2015 was 31.0 per 100,000 in the counties where the Democratic 
Party did not win in any of the 2008, 2012, or 2016 elections, as compared 
to an increase of 6.0 per 100,000 in those counties in which Democrats won 
in 2016 (and lost in 2008 and 2012). In counties where the Democratic 
Party won once in 2008 or 2012 but lost in 2016, there was an increase in 
mortality of 21.1 per 100,000, compared to an increase of 8.1 per 100,000 
in those in which the Democratic Party won in 2016. Lastly, for those 
counties where the Democratic Party won in both 2008 and 2012 elections, 
there was a significant (p<0.001) difference in the change in mortality: 
counties support towards the Republican Party saw an increase in mortality 
of 10.7 per 100,000, whereas those that voted Democratic again saw a 
decrease in mortality of 15.7 per 100,000.  
Figure 2 shows the result of the analysis using continuous election data. An 
increase in mortality from 1999-2005 to 2009-2015 is associated with a 
 12 
 
significant (p<0.001) increase in support for the Republican Party in 2016. 
Specifically, the results of the linear mixed model show that an increase of 
15.2 deaths per 100,000 is associated with a shift in the vote towards the 
Republican Party of 1% compared to previous elections (β=-0.066, 95% CI -
0.072 to -0.059, p<0.001). The figure clearly indicates that increasing 
mortality and a Republican shift in voting was most pronounced in the South 
(in blue) and the Mid-West (green), while counties in the West are 
prominent in the opposite quadrant (decrease in mortality and swing voting 
towards Democrats). 
Table 3 shows the results of the voting patterns by absolute health 
inequality in life expectancy by income in the 2001-2014 period. Areas 
where the Republican party won in any election had wider health 
inequalities, and this was more marked in areas where the Democratic party 
did not win in the 2008 and 2012 election (absolute health inequality of 7.23 
and 5.17 years for areas where the Republican party or the Democratic party 
won in 2016, respectively, p<0.001) and in areas where the Democratic 
party won in both the 2008 and 2012 elections (absolute health inequality of 
7.47 and 6.59 years for areas where the Republican party or the Democratic 
party won in 2016, respectively, p=0.07). 
The inferences remained unchanged when limiting the analysis to the six 
states that voted Republican in 2016 as opposed to Democratic in 2012 (see 
Appendix Table 1). Inferences remained unchanged, and patterns are 
 13 
 
strengthened, when comparing the change in vote patterns in 2016 with the 
2000 and 2008 elections (see Appendix Table 2). Inferences remained 
unchanged when using mortality for all races (see Appendix Table 3). Using 
relative health inequalities did not change the inferences either (see 
Appendix Table 4).

DISCUSSION 
We identified a county-level association between an upward trend in 
mortality among non-Hispanic whites during the period 1999-2015 and 
increased support for the Republican candidate in the 2016 presidential 
election. An increase of approximately 15 deaths per 100,000 was 
associated with a 1% vote swing toward the Republican Party. This mortality 
increase is less than half of what was reported by Case & Deaton for non-
Hispanic whites nationally. We also observed that areas with wider health 
inequalities were more likely to vote for the Republican party in 2016, 
regardless of the vote in the previous elections. These results were robust to 
our sensitivity analyses, including a restriction to the 2016 swing states, 
including all elections in the last 20 years without incumbent candidates 
(2000, 2008 and 2016), using mortality for all races, and using relative 
measures of inequality. 
The association between health status and voting patterns in previous 
US election cycle has been examined previously. A recent study found that 
excess mortality among blacks may have led to outcomes of state-level 
elections that would not have been observed if blacks had similar mortality 
to whites(Rodriguez et al., 2015). Analysis of the results of the Republican 
Party primaries conducted in early 2016 highlighted that support for Donald 
Trump was higher in areas with increased mortality in middle aged non-
Hispanic whites(Guo, 2016). Other post-election analyses have examined 
 16 
 
static health indicators (e.g., life expectancy or disease prevalence) 
(Inglehart and Norris, 2016), or an increase in ‘deaths of despair’(Monnat, 
2016) as predictors of Trump support, with analogous results to our study.  
However, we are interested in describing shifts in voting patterns, which 
requires longitudinal data on health care trends as cross-sectional (static) 
health indicators may represent long-term socioeconomic conditions instead 
of recent changes.  
A recent report by Bor(Bor, 2017) used longitudinal life expectancy 
data to show that countries with decreases in life expectancy in the last 3 
decades had an increased support for Trump. In our study, we examined a 
narrower age group (45 to 54), where increases in a specific group of causes 
of death (including drug and alcohol poisonings) have been reported(Case 
and Deaton, 2017). Contrary to expectation, economic downturns almost 
uniformly lead to improvement in population health indicators(Ruhm, 2008). 
However, these improvements have been mitigated in the last decade, 
mostly due to a worsening in drug and alcohol poisonings(Ruhm, 2015). We 
also add to the report by Bor an analysis of the association between health 
inequalities in life expectancy by income and increased support for trump. 
We believe this fits in our framework (Figure 1) as one of the consequences 
of worsening social and economic inequalities(Piketty and Zucman, 2014). 
The co-occurrence of the two main phenomena described here is, to 
our knowledge, unprecedented.  In the last century mortality reversal in the 
 17 
 
US has been restricted almost exclusively to influenza, HIV, and other 
infectious conditions in special sub-populations. Change in political and social 
conditions must be further examined to understand how social upheaval 
drives increases in mortality. Virchow, writing in the 19th century, stated that 
“If disease is the expression of individual life under unfavorable conditions, 
then epidemics are the symptom of major disturbances in society”(Virchow, 
1849). The mortality pattern described by Case and Deaton(Case and 
Deaton, 2015) could be therefore understood as the symptom for other 
major disturbances, the social upheaval we described above. Health data, 
which is routinely collected, can serve as a marker of this social upheaval 
and signal areas with increased distress where social and public health 
interventions may be targeted. 
In particular, increasing mortality rates may be reflecting changes in 
political representation, employment conditions, family and community 
networks, and inequalities in education and employment opportunity. For 
example, widespread plant closures resulting in a sharp rupture of the social 
contract afforded middle-aged industrial workers may have created a 
uniquely vulnerable cohort for whom the loss of life-long employment 
brought enormous social and psychological trauma. Moreover, it would also 
appear that inadequate social support systems were in place to buffer this 
loss(Beckfield and Bambra, 2016). Diseases of despair and hopelessness - 
drug abuse, alcoholism, suicide and liver disease – have all risen markedly in 
 18 
 
this group(Beckfield and Bambra, 2016; Case and Deaton, 2015). This is 
similar to the social upheaval and resulting increases in mortality that were 
observed in Russia and other eastern European after 1989(Cornia and 
Paniccià, 2000). In that context, acute psychosocial stress, increased alcohol 
consumption, increased unemployment, and changes to family structure 
were observed and believed to drive increases in mortality(Cornia and 
Paniccià, 2000).  Under these circumstances an embrace of authoritarian 
political leadership has been observed (Jeffries, 2016). 
Our work has some limitations. First, it is exploratory in nature and 
uses an ecological design, thereby precluding individual-level explanations. 
For our purposes, however, the ecological nature of our study is a strength, 
given that estimating an individual-level mortality risk, rather than 
contextual upheaval, may not capture forces acting in the social 
environment. Second, we did not to adjust for potential confounders of the 
mortality – voting association, such as the sociodemographic (race, age, 
gender) or socioeconomic (education, income, occupation) composition of 
each county. We choose this approach because our interest was not in 
obtaining inferences related to the independent association of mortality with 
shifts in voting patterns, but rather the overall magnitude of the 
hypothesized effect. Third, we focused our main analysis on adults aged 45 
to 54, instead of the entire population or other specific age groups. We did 
this for several reasons, namely: (1) this is a population with a high voter 
 19 
 
turnout(File, 2014); (2) this population was able to vote in all elections in 
this study; (3) this has been population of special public health interest in 
recent years, as a source of a large number of preventable deaths with 
worsening health conditions(Case and Deaton, 2015). Fourth, mortality data 
was missing in countries with very low event rates (approximately 16% in 
each period, with complete data on 81% of counties), and health inequality 
data was only available in counties with a population > 25,000 (~50% of the 
counties). Lastly, we could not conduct a single-year of age standardization 
because of low counts of mortality in many smaller counties that result in 
suppressed/missing data.  
To conclude, our study found that an increase in mortality in US 
counties in the last 15 years and wider health inequalities in life expectancy 
were associated with stronger support for the Republican Party candidate in 
the 2016 presidential election. Significant deterioration in population health, 
as characterized by increases in mortality, may stem from the same 
processes that lead to sudden unexpected shifts in political alignment.

The p-value was obtained from a linear mixed model (weighted by 
population in 2012) with random intercepts for each state. The p-value tests 
the null hypothesis that the absolute health inequality by income is equal 
between counties with the same number of Democratic Party wins in 
2008/2012 but that differ by the 2016 winner.

Results are presented as Δ Mortality Rate per 100,000 2009-2015 minus 
1999-2005. The p-value was obtained from a linear mixed model (weighted 
by population in 2012) with random intercepts for each state. The dependent 
variable is the change in mortality between the two periods and the 
independent variables are the number of wins for the Democratic Party in 
2008 and 2012 and the winner of the 2016 election, along with an 
interaction term for the two independent variables. The p-value tests the 
null hypothesis that the difference in mortality is equal between counties 
with the same number of Democratic Party wins in 2008/2012 but that differ 
by the 2016 winner. N/A: no county was in this category (and hence the p-
value was not estimable).

random intercepts for each state. The dependent variable is the absolute 
health inequality by income and the independent variables are the number 
of wins for the Democratic Party in 2008 and 2012 and the winner of the 
2016 election, along with an interaction term for the two independent 
variables. The p-value tests the null hypothesis that the absolute health
