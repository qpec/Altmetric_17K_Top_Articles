During the 2016–17 influenza season (October 2, 2016–
May 20, 2017) in the United States, influenza activity* was 
moderate. Activity remained low through November, increased 
during December, and peaked in February nationally, although 
there were regional differences in the timing of influenza 
activity. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated through 
mid-March and were predominant overall for the season, but 
influenza B viruses were most commonly reported from late 
March through May. This report summarizes influenza activity 
in the United States during October 2, 2016–May 20, 2017† 
and updates the previous summary (1).
Viral Surveillance
CDC receives influenza test results from public health 
and clinical laboratories located in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, 
and the District of Columbia through U.S. World Health 
Organization (WHO) Collaborating Laboratories and the 
National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System. 
During October 2, 2016– May 20, 2017, clinical laboratories 
tested 865,168 specimens for influenza virus: 121,223 (14.0%) 
specimens tested positive for influenza virus (Figure 1), includ-
ing 84,854 (70.0%) that tested positive for influenza A viruses 
and 36,369 (30.0%) that tested positive for influenza B viruses. 
Nationally, the percentage of specimens tested by clinical 
laboratories that were positive for influenza peaked during the 
3 weeks ending February 11, February 18, and February 25, 
2017 (weeks 6, 7, and 8) at 23.6%, 24.2%, and 24.3%, respec-
tively. At a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
regional§ level, the timing of peak percent positivity varied. In 
regions 8 and 10, the percentage of viruses testing positive for 
influenza peaked during the week ending December 31, 2016 
(week 52) and in region 9, the peak occurred during the week 
ending January 14, 2017 (week 2). In each of regions 1, 2, 3, 
5, 6, and 7 the peak occurred from the week ending February 
11 to February 25, 2017 (weeks 6–8). Region 4 also had peaks 
in influenza activity during the week ending February 11 
through the week ending February 25, 2017 (weeks 6–8), and 
experienced a second peak during the week ending March 25, 
2017 (week 12).
Public health laboratories tested a total of 84,303 specimens 
during October 2, 2016–May 20, 2017, and 40,728 were 
positive for influenza, including 31,736 (77.9%) influenza A 
and 8,992 (22.1%) influenza B viruses (Figure 2). Among 
the 31,411 influenza A viruses subtyped, 30,519 (97.2%) 
were influenza A(H3N2) viruses and 892 (2.8%) were 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. Influenza B lineage infor-
mation was available for 6,875 (76.5%) influenza B viruses: 
4,892 (71.2%) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage and 1,983 
(28.8%) to the B/Victoria lineage.
Age data were available for 36,426 of the influenza-positive 
patients tested by public health laboratories. Overall, 2,912 
(8.0%) persons were aged 0–4 years, 11,066 (30.4%) were 
aged 5–24 years, 10,872 (29.8%) were aged 25–64 years, and 
11,576 (31.8%) were aged ≥65 years. Influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses were predominant among all age groups, accounting 
for 70% of viruses identified among persons aged 0–4 years 
and 80% of viruses reported among persons aged ≥65 years. 
The largest proportion of reported influenza B viruses occurred 
* The CDC influenza surveillance system collects five categories of information 
from eight data sources: 1) viral surveillance (U.S. World Health Organization 
collaborating laboratories, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus 
Surveillance System, and novel influenza A virus case reporting); 2) outpatient 
illness surveillance (U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance 
Network); 3) mortality (the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality 
Surveillance System and influenza-associated pediatric mortality reports); 
4) hospitalizations (FluSurv-NET, which includes the Emerging Infections 
Program and surveillance in three additional states); and 5) summary of the 
geographic spread of influenza (state and territorial epidemiologist reports).

in persons aged 5–24 years; influenza B viruses accounted for 
28% of the viruses reported for that age group.
Novel Influenza A Viruses
Three human infections with novel influenza A viruses were 
reported to CDC during the 2016–17 influenza season. The 
first was an infection with an influenza A(H1N2) variant 
(H1N2v) virus¶ reported by Iowa public health officials during 
the week ending November 19, 2016 (week 46). The patient 
was not hospitalized and fully recovered.
The second case, a human infection with a North American 
lineage avian influenza A(H7N2) virus, was reported to CDC 
during the week ending December 24, 2016 (week 51). The 
patient reported close, prolonged unprotected exposure to the 
respiratory secretions of infected, sick cats at a New York City 
animal shelter. This is the first avian influenza A(H7N2) virus 
infection in humans identified in the United States since 2003 
and the first known human infection with an influenza A virus 
acquired through exposure to an ill cat. The patient was mildly 
ill, not hospitalized, and recovered completely.
The third case, an infection with an influenza A(H3N2) 
variant (H3N2v) virus, was detected through the Department 
of Defense Global Laboratory–based Influenza Surveillance 
Program and reported by Texas during the week ending 
April 29, 2017 (week 17). The patient reported contact with 
swine at an agricultural event the week preceding illness onset, 
was not hospitalized, and fully recovered.

¶ Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when 
isolated from swine, but are called variant influenza viruses when isolated from 
humans. Seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in the human 
population have important antigenic and genetic differences from influenza 
viruses circulating in swine.

specimens to CDC for further virus characterization. CDC 
characterizes influenza viruses through one or more laboratory 
tests, including the following: genomic sequencing, antigenic 
characterization by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), or 
neutralization assays. Historically, until vaccine effective-
ness estimates are available,** HI data have been used most 
commonly to assess the antigenic similarity between vaccine 
reference viruses and circulating viruses to infer how well the 
vaccine might perform. Since the 2014–15 season, a substantial 
proportion of influenza A(H3N2) viruses have not yielded suf-
ficient hemagglutination titers for antigenic characterization 
by HI assay. The focus reduction assay (a neutralization test), 
has been used to supplement HI testing for antigenic charac-
terization of a subset of influenza A(H3N2) viruses. For nearly 
all influenza-positive surveillance samples received by CDC, 
next-generation sequencing†† is performed to determine the 
genetic identity of circulating viruses.
For the 2016–17 season, CDC genetically characterized 
2,476 influenza viruses (311 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 
1,280 influenza A(H3N2), and 885 influenza B viruses) 
collected by U.S. laboratories since October 1, 2016.

** A virus is considered “reference virus–like” if its hemagglutination inhibition 
(HI) or neutralization focus reduction assay (FRA) titer is within fourfold of 
the homologous HI/FRA titer of the reference strain. A virus is considered as 
low to the reference virus if there is an eightfold or greater reduction in the 
HI or FRA titer when compared with the homologous HI or FRA titer of the 
reference strain.
 
†† Next generation sequencing uses advanced molecular detection to identify 
gene sequences from each virus in a sample and thus reveals the genetic 
variations among many different influenza virus particles in a single sample; 
these methods also reveal the entire coding region of the genomes. https://

influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses analyzed belonged to the 
predominant 6B.1 genetic subgroup, and the remaining two 
(1%) belonged to genetic group 6B. The HA gene of 1,187 
(93%) influenza A(H3N2) viruses analyzed belonged to the 
3C.2a genetic group, and the remaining 93 (7%) belonged to 
the 3C.3a genetic group. Of note, the 3C.2a genetic group 
includes an emerging subgroup known as 3C.2a1. The HA 
genes of 495 influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses analyzed all 
belonged to genetic group Y3. The HA genes of 390 influenza 
B/Victoria-lineage viruses all belonged to genetic group V1A. 
However, 78 (20%) of the 390 B/Victoria-lineage viruses 
have several amino acid changes, including two amino acid 
deletions at positions 162 and 163 in the HA gene, which 
alter the antigenic properties of these viruses. Viruses with 
these changes are currently being referred to as the “B/Victoria 
deletion variant subgroup.”
CDC has antigenically characterized 1,824 influenza 
viruses collected by U.S. laboratories since October 1, 2016 
(296 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 772 influenza A(H3N2), 
and 756 influenza B viruses). Among the 296 A(H1N1)
pdm09 viruses, 294 (99.3%) were antigenically characterized 
as A/California/7/2009-like, the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
component of the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere vaccine. 
Among the influenza A(H3N2) viruses, 730 (94.9%) were 
antigenically characterized as A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like, 
a genetic group 3C.2a virus recommended as the A(H3N2) 
component of the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere vaccine. 
Among 42 viruses that were antigenically different from 
A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like viruses (i.e., reacted poorly 
with ferret antisera raised against reference viruses repre-
senting A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like vaccine viruses), 36 
(85.7%) belonged to genetic group 3C.3a, represented by 
the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 reference virus, which 
was included as the A(H3N2) component of the 2015–16 
Northern Hemisphere vaccine.
Among influenza B viruses, 327 B/Victoria-lineage viruses 
were antigenically characterized using postinfection ferret 
antisera and among these, 283 (86.5%) were antigenically 
characterized as B/Brisbane/60/2008-like, a recommended 
influenza B component of the 2016–17 Northern hemisphere 
trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccines. Among the 
44 B/Victoria linage viruses that had reduced titers against 
B/Brisbane/60/2008-like viruses, 39 (88.6%) belong to 
the B/Victoria deletion variant subgroup. All 429 (100%) 
B/Yamagata-lineage viruses tested were antigenically char-
acterized as B/Phuket/3073/2013-like, the recommended 
influenza B component of the 2016–17 Northern Hemisphere 
quadrivalent influenza vaccines.
Antiviral Susceptibility of Influenza Viruses
CDC tested 2,569 influenza virus specimens (304 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 1,303 influenza A(H3N2), and 
962 influenza B viruses) collected in the United States during 
October 1, 2016–May 20, 2017 for resistance to the influenza 
neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications oseltamivir, 
zanamivir, and peramivir, which are currently recommended 
for use against seasonal influenza. All 2,569 influenza viruses 
tested were found to be susceptible to all three of these antivi-
ral medications. An additional 34 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 
viruses were tested for resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir 
and an additional 1,083 influenza A(H3N2) viruses were tested 
for resistance to oseltamivir and zanamivir; all were found to 
be susceptible to these antiviral medications.
2016–17 Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness
Data collected through the U.S. Influenza Vaccine 
Effectiveness Network during November 28, 2016–April 14, 
2017, indicate that influenza vaccination this season reduced 
the overall risk for influenza-associated medical visits by 
42% (95% CI = 35%–48%). Vaccine effectiveness against 
the predominant influenza A(H3N2) viruses was 34% (95% 
CI = 24%–42%) and vaccine effectiveness against influenza B 
viruses was 56% (95% CI = 47%–64%).
Composition of the 2017–18 Influenza Vaccine
The Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related 
Biologic Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) has recom-
mended that the 2017–18 influenza trivalent vaccine to be used 
in the United States contain an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)
pdm09-like virus, an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like 
virus, and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) 
virus. It is recommended that quadrivalent vaccines, which 
have two influenza B viruses, contain the viruses recommended 
for the trivalent vaccines, as well as a B/Phuket/3073/2013-
like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus (2). This represents an update 
in the influenza A(H1N1) component compared with the 
composition of the 2016–17 influenza vaccines. The recom-
mended Northern Hemisphere 2017–18 vaccine viruses are 
the same as the vaccine viruses recommended for inclusion 
in the 2017 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. These 
vaccine recommendations were based on a number of factors, 
including global influenza virologic and epidemiologic surveil-
lance, genetic and antigenic characterization, human serology 
studies, antiviral susceptibility, and the availability of candidate 
influenza viruses.

Outpatient Illness Surveillance
Nationally, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for 
influenza-like illness§§ (ILI) to heath care providers participat-
ing in the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance 
Network (ILINet) was at or above the national baseline¶¶ level 
of 2.2% from the week ending December 17, 2016 (week 50) 
and remained at or above baseline for 17 consecutive weeks 
during the 2016–17 season (Figure 3). Nationally, the peak 
percentage of outpatient visits for ILI was 5.1% and occurred 
during the week ending February 11, 2017 (week 6). During 
the 2011–12 through 2015–16 seasons, peak weekly percent-
ages of outpatient visits for ILI ranged from 3.6% to 6.1% and 
remained at or above baseline levels for an average of 13 weeks 
(range = 1–20 weeks).
ILINet data are used to produce a weekly jurisdiction-level 
measure of ILI activity,*** ranging from minimal to high. 
The number of jurisdictions experiencing elevated ILI activity 
peaked during the week ending February 11, 2017 (week 6) 
when 31 states experienced high ILI activity. Thirty-seven 
jurisdictions (36 states and Puerto Rico) experienced high ILI 
activity during at least 1 week this season. The peak number 
of jurisdictions experiencing high ILI activity during a single 
week from 2011 to 2016 has ranged from four during the 
2011–12 season to 45 during the 2014–15 season.
Geographic Spread of Influenza Activity
State and territorial epidemiologists report the geographic 
distribution of influenza in their jurisdictions††† through a 
weekly influenza activity code.§§§ The geographic distribution 
of influenza activity was most extensive during the week ending 
February 11, 2017 (week 6), when 47 jurisdictions reported 
widespread influenza activity. From 2011 to 2016, the peak 
number of jurisdictions reporting widespread influenza activ-
ity ranged from 20 during the 2011–12 season to 48 during 
the 2012–13 season.
Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations
CDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-
confirmed influenza infections in adults and children through 
the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-
NET),¶¶¶ which covers approximately 27 million persons (9% 
of the U.S. population). During October 1, 2016–April 30, 
2017, a total of 18,184 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related 
hospitalizations were reported, with a cumulative incidence 
for all age groups of 65.0 per 100,000 population. The hos-
pitalization rate was highest among persons aged ≥65 years, 
who accounted for approximately 60% of reported influenza-
associated hospitalizations.
 §§ Defined as a fever (temperature ≥100.0°F [≥37.8°C], oral or equivalent) and 
cough and/or sore throat, without a known cause other than influenza.
 ¶¶ The national and regional baselines are the mean percentages of visits for 
influenza-like illness (ILI) during noninfluenza weeks for the previous 
three seasons plus two standard deviations. Noninfluenza weeks are defined 
as periods of ≥2 consecutive weeks during which each week accounted for 
<2% of the season’s total number of specimens that tested positive for 
influenza. National and regional percentages of patient visits for ILI are 
weighted based on state population. Use of the national baseline for regional 
data is not appropriate.
 *** Activity levels are based on the percentage of outpatient visits in a jurisdiction 
attributed to ILI and are compared with the average percentage of ILI visits 
that occur during weeks with little or no influenza virus circulation. Activity 
levels range from minimal, corresponding to ILI activity from outpatient 
clinics at or below the average, to high, corresponding to ILI activity from 
outpatient clinics much higher than the average. Because the clinical 
definition of ILI is nonspecific, not all ILI is caused by influenza; however, 
when combined with laboratory data, the information on ILI activity provides 
a clearer picture of influenza activity in the United States.
 ††† For this surveillance component, 54 jurisdictions participate: the 50 states, 
the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands.
 §§§ Levels of activity are 1) no activity; 2) sporadic: isolated laboratory-confirmed 
influenza cases or a laboratory-confirmed outbreak in one institution, with 
no increase in activity; 3) local: increased ILI, or two or more institutional 
outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in one region of the state, 
with recent laboratory evidence of influenza in that region; virus activity no 
greater than sporadic in other regions; 4) regional: increased ILI activity or 
institutional outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed influenza) in two or 
more outbreaks, but less than half of the regions in the state with recent 
laboratory evidence of influenza in those regions; and 5) widespread: 
increased ILI activity or institutional outbreaks (ILI or laboratory-confirmed 
influenza) in at least half the regions in the state, with recent laboratory 
evidence of influenza in the state.
 ¶¶¶ FluSurv-NET conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-
confirmed, influenza-associated hospitalizations in children and adolescents 
aged <18 years (since the 2003–04 influenza season) and adults aged ≥18 years 
(since the 2005–06 influenza season). The FluSurv-NET covers 
approximately 70 counties in the 10 Emerging Infections Program states 
(California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New 
Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee) and additional Influenza 
Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states. IHSP began during the 
2009–10 season to enhance surveillance during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. 
IHSP sites included Idaho, Iowa, Michigan, Oklahoma, and South Dakota 
during the 2009–10 season; Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode 
Island, and Utah during the 2010–11 season; Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, 
and Utah during the 2011–12 season; Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, 
and Utah during the 2012–13 season; and Michigan, Ohio, and Utah during 
the 2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16, and 2016–17 seasons. Cumulative 
unadjusted incidence rates are calculated using CDC’s National Center for 
Health Statistics population estimates for the counties included in the 
surveillance catchment area. Laboratory confirmation is dependent on 
clinician-ordered influenza testing, and testing for influenza often is 
underutilized because of the poor reliability of rapid test results and greater 
reliance on clinical diagnosis for influenza. Therefore, cases identified as part 
of influenza hospitalization surveillance likely are an underestimation of the 
actual number of persons hospitalized with influenza.

The cumulative hospitalization rate during October 1, 
2016–April 30, 2017, was 44.1 per 100,000 population among 
children aged 0–4 years, 16.7 among children and adolescents 
aged 5–17 years, 19.8 among adults aged 18–49 years, 65.1 
among adults aged 50–64 years, and 290.5 among adults aged 
≥65 years. Among all hospitalizations, 14,185 (78.0%) were 
associated with influenza A virus infections, 3,873 (21.2%) 
with influenza B virus infections, 62 (0.3%) with influenza A 
virus and influenza B virus co-infections, and 64 (0.4%) with 
an influenza virus for which the type was not determined. 
Among the 5,383 patients for which influenza A subtype 
information was available, 5,276 (98.0%) were infected with 
influenza A(H3N2) viruses and 107 (2.0%) were infected with 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.
Complete medical chart abstraction data were available 
for 7,315 (40.2%) hospitalized adults and children with 
laboratory-confirmed influenza as of June 9, 2017. Among 
6,838 hospitalized adults with complete medical chart 
abstraction, 6,434 (94.1%) had at least one reported 
underlying medical condition that placed them at high risk**** 
for influenza-associated complications. The most commonly 
reported underlying medical conditions among adults were

 †††† The seasonal baseline proportion of pneumonia and influenza (P&I) deaths 
is projected using a robust regression procedure, in which a periodic 
regression model is applied to the observed percentage of deaths from P&I 
that were reported by the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality 
Surveillance System during the preceding 5 years. The epidemic threshold 
is set at 1.645 standard deviations above the seasonal baseline.
cardiovascular disease (51.8%), metabolic disorders (44.4%), 
obesity (34.8%), and chronic lung disease (30.1%). Among 
477 hospitalized children with complete medical chart 
abstraction, 269 (56.4%) had at least one underlying medical 
condition; the most commonly reported of these were asthma 
(26.4%) and neurologic disorder (23.2%). Among 447 women 
of childbearing age (15–44 years) hospitalized with laboratory-
confirmed influenza infections, 119 (26.6%) were pregnant.
Pneumonia and Influenza-Associated Mortality
CDC tracks pneumonia and influenza (P&I)–attributed 
deaths through the National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS) Mortality Reporting System. The percentages of 
deaths attributed to P&I are released 2 weeks after the week 
of death to allow for collection of sufficient data to produce a 
stable P&I mortality percentage. Weekly mortality surveillance 
data include a combination of machine-coded and manually 
coded causes of death collected from death certificates. During 
the 2016–17 season, there was a backlog of data requiring 
manual coding within the NCHS mortality surveillance 
data. Work is underway to reduce and monitor the number 
of records awaiting manual coding. The percentages of deaths 
attributable to P&I are higher among manually coded records 
than the more rapidly available machine coded records and 
might result in initially reported P&I percentages that are 
lower than percentages calculated from final data.
During the 2016–17 season, based on data from NCHS, 
the proportion of deaths attributed to P&I was at or above 
the epidemic threshold†††† for 12 consecutive weeks from 
the week ending December 31, 2016 through the week end-
ing March 18, 2017 (weeks 52–11). Mortality attributed to 
P&I peaked twice, once at 8.2% of all deaths during the week 
ending January 21, 2017 (week 3) and once at 8.1% during 
the week ending February 25, 2017 (week 8). During the 
2011–12 through 2015–16 seasons, the peak weekly percent-
ages of deaths attributable to P&I ranged from 8.7% during 
the 2011–12 season to 11.1% during the 2012–13 season.
Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality
CDC monitors pediatric influenza deaths through the 
Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Surveillance System. As 
of June 9, 2017, a total of 98 laboratory-confirmed influenza-
associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2016–17 
season had been reported to CDC from Chicago, New York 
City, and 28 states. Of these 98 deaths, 46 were associated 
with an influenza A(H3N2) virus infection, three with an 
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, 14 with an influenza 
A virus for which no subtyping was performed, 34 with an 
influenza B virus infection, and one with an influenza virus for 
which the type was not determined. Since influenza-associated 
pediatric mortality became a nationally notifiable condition in 
2004, the total number of influenza-associated pediatric deaths 
per season has ranged from 37 to 171, excluding the 2009 
pandemic, during which 358 pediatric deaths were reported to 
CDC during April 15, 2009–October 2, 2010.
Discussion
The 2016–17 influenza season was notable for the 
predominant circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses. 
Nationally, influenza activity peaked in mid-February, with 
influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominant early in the sea-
son through the week ending March 25, 2017 (week 12). 
Influenza B viruses became the predominant virus starting 
during week 13 (the week ending April 1, 2017) and remained 
the predominant virus through the end of May. The timing 
of peak influenza activity varied across the United States. 
Influenza activity peaked at least 1 month earlier (week 52 to 
week 2) in the western United States (regions 8, 9, and 10) than 
in the rest of the country. During the 2016–17 season, severity 
indicators (e.g., hospitalization and mortality rates) were within 
the range that has been observed during previous seasons when 
influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated. Previous influenza 
A(H3N2)–predominant seasons have been associated with 
increased hospitalizations and deaths compared with seasons 
that were not influenza A(H3N2)–predominant, especially 
among children aged <5 years and adults aged ≥65 years (3,4). 
The majority of influenza viruses antigenically characterized 
at CDC were similar to the reference viruses representing the 
recommended components for the 2016–17 vaccine. A small 
subset of antigenically distinct influenza B/Victoria viruses was 
detected. No antiviral resistance to oseltamivir, zanamivir, or 
peramivir was identified among tested influenza viruses from 
the 2016–17 season.
Final vaccine effectiveness estimates of 34% (95% 
CI = 24%–42%) against illness caused by influenza A(H3N2) 
viruses and 56% (95% CI = 47%–64%) against illness caused 
by influenza B viruses were similar to previous seasons when 
recommended vaccine viruses have been well matched to 
(i.e.,“like”) circulating viruses, including the lower effectiveness 
observed against well-matched A(H3N2) viruses. Evidence 
of reduced protection against A(H3N2) viruses, even when 
vaccine viruses and circulating viruses are well matched, has 
been observed since the 2011–12 season. In general, vacci-
nation with inactivated influenza vaccine has offered better

protection against influenza A(H1N1) and influenza B viruses 
(5). Even during seasons when vaccine effectiveness is reduced, 
vaccination can offer substantial benefit and reduce the likeli-
hood of severe outcomes such as hospitalization and death 
(6,7). During the 2012–13 season with estimated vaccination 
effectiveness against A(H3N2)-related illness of 39% (95% 
CI = 29%–47%), vaccination averted an estimated 5.6 million 
illnesses, 2.7 million medical visits, 61,500 hospitalizations, 
and 1,800 deaths (8). Estimates of the number of influenza 
illnesses, medical visits, and hospitalizations averted by influ-
enza vaccination during the 2016–17 season are scheduled to 
be published in December 2017.
Influenza antiviral medications are an important adjunct 
to vaccination in the treatment and prevention of influenza. 
Treatment with influenza antiviral medications as close to the 
onset of illness as possible is recommended for patients with 
confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, compli-
cated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who 
are at high risk for influenza complications. Antiviral treatment 
should not be withheld from patients who are at high risk for 
complications or who are severely ill with suspected influenza 
infection, even if rapid antigen-detection influenza diagnostic 
test results are negative (9).
Although summer influenza activity in the United States 
typically is low, influenza cases and outbreaks have occurred 
during summer months and clinicians should remain vigilant 
in considering influenza in the differential diagnosis of sum-
mer respiratory illnesses. Testing for seasonal influenza viruses 
and monitoring for novel influenza A virus infections should 
continue year round. Health care providers also are reminded 
to consider novel influenza virus infections in persons with 
influenza-like illness and swine or poultry exposure, or with 
severe acute respiratory infection after travel to areas where 
avian influenza viruses have been detected. Providers should 
alert the local public health department if novel influenza virus 
infection is suspected. Clinical laboratories using a commer-
cially available influenza diagnostic assay that includes influ-
enza A virus subtype determination should contact their state 
public health laboratory to facilitate transport and additional 
testing of any specimen that is positive for influenza A, but for 
which the subtype cannot be determined. Public health labo-
ratories should immediately send influenza A virus specimens 
that they cannot subtype using standard methods to CDC 
and submit all specimens that are otherwise unusual as soon 
as possible after identification.
Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted 
online weekly (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly). Additional 
information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, 
influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel 
influenza A infections in humans is available online (https://
www.cdc.gov/flu).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity 
year round in the United States. Timing of influenza activity and 
predominant circulating influenza viruses vary by season.
What is added by this report?
During the 2016–17 influenza season, influenza activity 
remained low through November 2016, increased during 
December, and peaked in February. During October 2, 2016–
May 20, 2017, influenza A(H3N2) viruses were identified most 
frequently, but influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses 
were also reported. Data collected from November 28, 2016 to 
April 14, 2017, indicate that influenza vaccination this season 
reduced the overall risk for influenza-associated medical visits 
by 42% (95% CI = 35%–48%). The composition of the 2017–18 
influenza vaccine has been updated to better match circulating 
influenza viruses.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons 
aged ≥6 months and remains the most effective way to prevent 
influenza illness. Antiviral medications are an important adjunct 
to vaccination in the treatment and prevention of influenza. 
Early treatment with neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medica-
tions is recommended for patients with severe, complicated, or 
progressive influenza illness and those at higher risk for 
influenza complications, including adults aged ≥65 years.
