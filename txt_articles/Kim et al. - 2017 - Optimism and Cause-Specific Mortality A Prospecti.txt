Growing evidence has linked positive psychological attributes like optimism to a lower risk of poor health out-
comes, especially cardiovascular disease. It has been demonstrated in randomized trials that optimism can be
learned. If associations between optimism and broader health outcomes are established, it may lead to novel in-
terventions that improve public health and longevity. In the present study, we evaluated the association between
optimism and cause-specific mortality in women after considering the role of potential confounding (sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, depression) and intermediary (health behaviors, health conditions) variables. We used
prospective data from the Nurses’ Health Study (n = 70,021). Dispositional optimism was measured in 2004; all-
cause and cause-specific mortality rates were assessed from 2006 to 2012. Using Cox proportional hazard models,
we found that a higher degree of optimism was associated with a lower mortality risk. After adjustment for sociode-
mographic confounders, compared with women in the lowest quartile of optimism, women in the highest quartile
had a hazard ratio of 0.71 (95% confidence interval: 0.66, 0.76) for all-cause mortality. Adding health behaviors, health
conditions, and depression attenuated but did not eliminate the associations (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence
interval: 0.85, 0.97). Associations were maintained for various causes of death, including cancer, heart disease,
stroke, respiratory disease, and infection. Given that optimism was associated with numerous causes of mortal-
ity, it may provide a valuable target for new research on strategies to improve health.

Although most biomedical and public health efforts to im-
prove health have been focused on reducing harmful life-
style risk factors, increasing attention has been paid to the
identification of positive health assets (1, 2). An emerging
body of research has suggested that various facets of posi-
tive psychological well-being are associated with better
health outcomes (3). In particular, dispositional optimism—
the generalized expectation that good things will happen—
has been linked with reduced risks of chronic health con-
ditions, especially vascular factors and disease (3–10).
Importantly, although optimism is approximately 25% heri-
table (11), initial (albeit short-term) randomized trials have
suggested that it can be modified using fairly accessible
tools (12–16). Thus, optimism may be a novel and promis-
ing target for new research on prevention and intervention
strategies aimed at improving health (17).
However, research on optimism and long-term health to
date is limited, with the most rigorous work primarily eval-
uating associations with cardiovascular morbidity and mor-
tality (3–10). A key question is whether optimism may be
related to broader health outcomes. If so, this may provide
some insight into key pathways via which optimism may
influence health beyond those primarily linked with cardio-
vascular disease. Moreover, although most studies on this
topic have included adjustment for sociodemographic fac-
tors, fewer have been able to account for a broad range of
variables that may either confound or lie on the pathway
linking optimism to disease outcomes (3). Prior work has
suggested that optimism is significantly associated with in-
dicators of socioeconomic status, with higher optimism
being evident among individual with more education or
more income (18). Furthermore, other work has suggested

 that higher optimism may lead to healthier diet or other be-
haviors (19), but it may also be that there is bidirectionality
in these relationships (20). Prior research has also indicated
that optimism may be associated with a reduced likelihood of
a variety of health-related conditions, such as an unhealthy
lipid profile or type 2 diabetes mellitus (21, 22), and that
optimism is not inevitably altered by alterations in disease
status (23). We used data from the Nurses’ Health Study
(NHS), a long-term observational study of women, to exam-
ine optimism and the risk of mortality, with careful assess-
ment of confounding (including depression) (24), and the
role of other factors to evaluate the association of optimism
with a lower risk of mortality.
METHODS
Study population
The Nurses’ Health Study began in 1976, when 121,700
female registered nurses who were 30–55 years of age com-
pleted a mailed questionnaire about their health and health
behaviors. Since then, questionnaires have been mailed to
participants every 2 years to obtain updated information.
The follow-up rate remains approximately 90%. In 2004,
a measure of optimism was included in the questionnaire,
and we therefore considered 2004 as the baseline for the
present study. Mortality and cause-specific mortality have
been assessed throughout follow-up (data are available
through 2014).
Women were excluded from the analyses if they died
before study baseline in 2004 (n = 19,586), did not answer
the baseline questionnaire in 2004 (n = 8,691), did not
answer optimism questions in 2004 (n = 4,122), or replied
to a shorter version of the questionnaire sent to persistent
nonresponders that did not assess optimism (n = 17,880).
To reduce concerns about reverse causality, we further
excluded women who died within 2 years of study baseline
in 2004 to take into account the possible concern that they
may have had recent changes in optimism due to underly-
ing illness (n = 1,400). Therefore, no person-time before
2006 was included in the analyses. The final analytic sam-
ple included 70,021 women. Women who were included in
the analysis were very similar to those who were excluded:
The mean ages were 70.0 years and 70.8 years, respec-
tively; 10.3% of those included had a master or doctoral
degree versus 8.4% of those who were excluded; and the
mean body mass indices (calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared) at baseline were 23.3
and 23.6, respectively. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the Brigham and Women’s
Hospital.
Measures
Optimism.
Optimism was assessed in 2004 and again in
2008 using the Life Orientation Test-Revised. The measure
has good discriminant and convergent validity, as well as
good reliability (25). Using a 5-point Likert scale, respon-
dents were asked the degree to which they agreed with
6 statements, such as, “In uncertain times, I usually expect
the best.” Negatively worded item were reverse coded, and
then all items were summed to create a composite score
that ranged from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating
higher levels of optimism. To reduce respondent burden,
4 filler items were omitted from the Life Orientation Test-
Revised by the Nurses’ Health Study investigators. Because
optimism may best be characterized by both endorsing posi-
tively worded items and rejecting negatively worded items
(26), we followed recommendations to use the 6-item com-
posite rather than 3-item subscales sometimes used in prior
research (27). Internal consistency reliability was high in
the present sample in 2004 (Cronbach α = 0.78). The intra-
class correlation was also high from 2004 to 2008, with a
value of 0.64. To assess the possibility of discontinuous or
threshold effects, we created quartiles of optimism based
on the score distribution in the sample. Median optimism
scores by quartile were 13, 19, 22, and 24.
Assessment of mortality and cause of mortality.
Information
about mortality was collected from systematic searches of
state vital records and the National Death Index; this was
supplemented by reports from family members and postal
authorities. Using these methods, we ascertained more than
98% of deaths in the cohort (28). Cause of death was evalu-
ated by study physicians (unaware of this study’s hypothe-
ses) who reviewed death certificates and medical records
when available.
Assessment of potential confounder or other relevant
variables.
Potential confounders included sociodemographic
factors and depression. Sociodemographic variables were
obtained from the 2006 questionnaire and included age
(continuous), race (white, black, Asian, or other), marital
status (married, divorced/separated/single, or widowed),
educational level (registered nurse/associate degree, bache-
lor degree, or master/doctorate degree), husband’s educa-
tional level (less than high school, some high school, high
school graduate, college graduate, or graduate school), and
father’s occupation when the nurse was 16 years old (none
(including retired and deceased), craftsman/laborer/farmer,
clerical/sales/service, or professional/managerial). Depression
status (yes vs. no) was defined according to self-report of
physician diagnosis of clinical depression, regular antidepres-
sant use, or depressive symptoms measured using the Center
for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale–Revised in 2006
or the Geriatric Depression Scale in all follow-up cycles
(depression defined as Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale score ≥10 or Geriatric Depression Scale
score ≥5) (29, 30). Depression status was updated at each
follow-up cycle.
Additional variables that may also be relevant, especially
as possible explanations of the relationship of optimism with
mortality, included health conditions (assessed in 2006 and
updated every 2 years) and health behaviors (assessed in
2006 and updated every 2–4 years). We identified and up-
dated information on these variables at each follow-up cycle.
Health conditions were self-reported (yes vs. no) and included
high cholesterol, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, myo-
cardial infarction, stroke, cancer, and body mass index, which
was calculated from self-reported weight and height (31).

 Health behaviors included diet, physical activity level,
cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and undergoing
annual physical examinations. Diet was assessed with the
Willett food frequency questionnaire (32), which comprises
questions about consumption of a range of foods over the
past year; overall diet quality was quantified using the
Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 (continuous variable
from 0 to 110). The Alternative Healthy Eating Index in-
cludes 11 different diet components that have been shown to
be related to chronic disease risk (33). Physical activity level
was assessed across 6 different types of exercise, and this
assessment has previously been validated in this cohort
(34). Activity was summarized as weekly expenditure of
metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs) per week (<3.0
METs/week, 3.0–8.9 METs/week, 9.0–17.9 METs/week,
18.0–26.9 METs/week, or ≥27.0 METs/week). Moderate
alcohol intake from wine, beer, and liquor was assessed;
values were combined and reported as grams per day of
alcohol (0.0 g/day, 0.1–14.9 g/day, or ≥15.0 g/day).
Participants were characterized as never, former, or cur-
rent smokers, with those in the latter group being further
categorized by the number of cigarettes smoked per day
(1–14 cigarettes/day, 15–24 cigarettes/day, or ≥25 cigar-
ettes/day). Information on participants’ annual physical
examinations for screening purposes (yes vs. no) was
also assessed on the 2006 questionnaire and updated
every 2 years thereafter.
Statistical analysis
Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate as-
sociations between baseline quartiles of optimism score in
2004 and mortality. In total, 5 models were evaluated for
analyses. The first 2 models focused on known potential con-
founding covariates; model 1 (considered the core model)
was adjusted for sociodemographic confounders, and model 2
was adjusted for sociodemographic variables and depres-
sion. In 2 subsequent models, we added sets of potential
intermediate variables to the core model and examined
their
impact
on
the
optimism-mortality
association.
Specifically, model 3 included time-updated health condi-
tions, and model 4 incorporated time-updated health beha-
viors into model 1 (core model). Finally, model 5 included
all variables from model 2 plus health conditions and be-
haviors. P values for trend were calculated by modeling
the median of each quartile of optimism score as a contin-
uous variable. The same set of models was used to inves-
tigate the relationship between optimism as a continuous
variable and all-cause mortality. The core model was used
to assess the relationship between optimism and cause-
specific mortality. Causes included heart disease, stroke,
respiratory disease, infection, total cancer, lung cancer,
breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and ovarian cancer. Other
than the women who died within 2 years of study baseline,
no additional women were excluded in this primary set of
cause-specific mortality models.
We conducted 3 additional secondary analyses. First, to
further address concerns about possible bias due to pre-
existing disease in the all-cause mortality analyses, we
excluded participants with prior cardiovascular disease or
cancer diagnoses as of the 2004 baseline. Second, to fur-
ther address this possible bias in the cause-specific mortal-
ity analyses, we excluded participants who had the disease
in question at baseline. Thus, in analyses in which we
examined heart disease as the cause of death, we excluded
participants who reported heart disease at baseline and
repeated this same procedure for stroke and cancer.
Because we did not have information on prevalent infec-
tion or respiratory diseases at baseline, we could not run
these models for those causes of death. Third, to facilitate
comparisons of effect size across studies, we analyzed opti-
mism as a continuous variable (standardized). Fourth, we
updated optimism scores in 2008 (lagging mortality by
2 years after the updated optimism measurement). All anal-
yses were conducted in SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
At baseline, the average age of respondents was 70.1
(standard deviation, 6.9) years. Most women were married
(69.2%). With regard to educational level, 69.0% had regis-
tered nurse or associate degrees, 20.7% had bachelor of
arts/science degrees, and 10.3% had master or doctorate de-
grees. The majority were white (97.6%); 1.3% were black,
0.8% were Asian, and 0.3% reported being another race/
ethnicity. Generally, the distributions of most sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, health behaviors, and health conditions
were similar across optimism quartiles in 2004 (Table 1).
However, there were some notable differences; for exam-
ple, more optimistic women tended to have more education
and to report more physical activity. They also reported a
lower prevalence of hypertension, high cholesterol, and type
2 diabetes mellitus and a substantially lower prevalence of
depression.
Optimism and risk of all-cause mortality
We observed strong associations between higher opti-
mism levels and lower risks of mortality (Table 2; all P for
trend < 0.001). For example, in the core model, when com-
paring the most optimistic women (top quartile) with least
optimistic (bottom quartile), the hazard ratio was 0.71
(95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66, 0.76) for all-cause
mortality. After we further controlled for depression, the re-
sults were not meaningfully different.
We also explored several groups of variables that may
help to explain the relationship of optimism with mortality
(Table 2). There was a modest attenuation of the primary
association when health conditions were included (hazard
ratio (HR) = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.78) (35, 36). Adding
health behaviors to the core model yielded a larger attenua-
tion (HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.92). When we included
all groups of variables in the model (health behaviors,
health conditions, and depression), the results were further
attenuated (HR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.97) but remained
statistically significant (P for trend < 0.001), indicating
that these factors explain part but not all of the observed
relationship between optimism and mortality.

Optimism and Cause-Specific Mortality
25

 Optimism and risk of cause-specific mortality
As demonstrated in Table 3, in the core models, higher
optimism was associated with a lower risk of mortality
from many major causes of death, including cancer, heart
disease, and stroke (for all, P for trend < 0.05). For exam-
ple, when comparing the most optimistic individuals with
the least, the most optimistic had a 16% lower hazard ratio
for all cancers (95% CI: 0.74, 0.96); the hazard ratio was
0.62 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.76) for heart disease mortality and
0.61 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.85) for stroke mortality. Optimism
was also associated with reduced hazard ratio for mortality
from respiratory disease (HR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.82)
and infection (HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.80). Although
the magnitude of the relative risk estimates for the specific
causes of cancer mortality were consistent (HRs ranging from
0.82–0.88), none reached statistical significance, likely because
of the limited number of deaths from each type of cancer.
Secondary analyses
After we excluded women with diagnoses of cardiovascu-
lar disease or cancer at baseline, the association between opti-
mism and all-cause mortality was not meaningfully different
(see Web Table 1, available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/).
In analyses of cause-specific mortality (i.e., heart disease,
stroke, and cancers), when we excluded participants who had
the specific disease at baseline, the results were largely similar
(see Web Table 2). When we considered optimism as a con-
tinuous variable in the core model, each standard-deviation
increase in optimism was associated with a multivariate-
adjusted hazard ratio of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.88) for
all-cause mortality. Finally, in analyses in which we used
updated data on optimism score from 2008, results were sim-
ilar to those from the main analyses but slightly stronger. For
example, when comparing the most optimistic women to the
least optimistic in the core model, the most optimistic women
had a 36% lower hazard ratio for all-cause mortality (95%
CI: 0.60, 0.69).
DISCUSSION
We found strong and statistically significant associations of
increasing levels of optimism with decreasing risks of mortal-
ity, including mortality due each major cause of death, such
as cancer, heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and infec-
tion. Importantly, findings were maintained after close control
for potential confounding factors, including sociodemographic
characteristics and depression (both diagnosed depression
and depressive symptoms) and were still evident, although
attenuated, even after inclusion of health conditions or health
behaviors in the models.
To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies in which
significant, broad-based associations between optimism and
health, including cancer mortality, have been demonstrated
in a general population sample. However, the association
between optimism and cancer mortality was weaker than
those observed for the other primary causes of death; some
cancers (e.g., breast cancer) appear to be somewhat intracta-
ble to many feasible modifications, which might explain this
weaker association. The observed association when all can-
cers were combined was stronger than that observed when
considering specific types of cancer mortality. For any given
type of cancer, the number of cases was often small (ranging
from 153 to 579 cases), and the magnitudes of the hazard
ratios were also small. If the true effect of optimism on can-
cer is somewhat small, it may be difficult to detect signifi-
cant associations without substantially more cases; this may
explain why prior work has reported null associations (our
sample included 2,335 cancer deaths, compared with 317 in
the only other large study in which this question was exam-
ined) (10). In the present study, however, the consistency of
risk estimates across the different cancer types was striking.

 This is also one of the first studies in which the associa-
tions of optimism with death from infection and respiratory
disease have been reported. The association with infection
that we found is consistent with results from previous
research that indicated the effects of optimism on immune
function; studies have demonstrated that individuals with
higher optimism levels have better immune responsiveness
after vaccination and that changes in optimism levels pre-
dict alterations in immune functioning over time (37, 38).
Further, the association with respiratory disease is consis-
tent with previous research in which researchers demon-
strated an association between higher levels of baseline
optimism and healthier levels of objectively measured pulmo-
nary function over the course of follow-up (39). However,
the association of optimism with death from infection and
respiratory disease should be interpreted cautiously because
of the novelty of the findings and should be investigated fur-
ther in future research.
Optimists appear to differ on numerous processes that
are critically important to a broad spectrum of health out-
comes. It has been shown in several studies that optimism
is associated with a healthier lipid profile, lower levels of
inflammatory markers, higher levels of serum antioxidants,
and as noted above, better immune responsiveness (21, 37,
38, 40–42). Other investigations have suggested a slower
rate of telomere shortening over time, healthier autonomic
function, and higher levels of heart rate variability (43–45).
Indeed, results from these reports of associations between
optimism and a wide array of health factors are consistent
with our finding that optimism is associated with multiple
causes of death. Our results also suggest that we should
consider healthier behaviors (e.g., eating a healthier diet,
engaging in more physical activity, etc.)—which are asso-
ciated with many disease outcomes—not simply as poten-
tial confounders, especially in light of past research that
showed that optimism is associated with increased physical
activity, higher-quality sleep, abstention from cigarette
smoking, and consumption of healthier diets (19, 42, 46–49).
In the present study, given that assessments of optimism pre-
ceded assessments of behavior and that primary associations
were somewhat attenuated after inclusion of behavior in the
model, our findings might suggest that these behaviors
partly serve as a mechanism underlying the observed asso-
ciations between optimism and mortality (35, 36) (although
we recognize that it may be difficult to distinguish well
between confounding and intermediate variables and that
health behaviors may be both confounding and intermediate
variables). Although the present study was not designed to
test such mediational hypotheses, its results do suggest that
studies that can explicitly test potential mediating pathways
may be fruitful.
To our knowledge, there have been only 3 studies in
which investigators have examined the association between
dispositional optimism and mortality in a general popula-
tion sample, and in those, only 2 specific causes of death
were considered: cardiovascular disease and cancer (8–10).
In a study conducted among 999 older Dutch men and
women, higher levels of optimism were associated with
45%–77% lower risks of cardiovascular mortality and all-
cause mortality (although that study did not control for
depression) (8). In a second study conducted in a different
sample of 545 older Dutch men, researchers similarly
found that a higher level of optimism was associated with a
substantially lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (9). In a
third study, conducted among 97,253 US women, investi-
gators also found that a higher optimism level was associ-
ated with lower risks of CHD-related and all-cause
mortality, but findings for the cancer-mortality association
were mixed (10). Thus, the few existing studies generally
support our findings.
Limitations of the present study should be considered.
Reverse causation is possible if underlying health conditions
influence optimism. However, we conducted multiple analy-
ses to minimize this issue. In the primary analyses, we mea-
sured optimism in 2004 and only considered deaths that
occurred from 2006 to 2012 (the large majority of which
occurred in the later years). In the secondary analyses, we ex-
cluded anyone with a major chronic disease at study baseline
for the all-cause mortality analyses and anyone who had
cancer, heart disease, or stroke at baseline for those cause-
specific analyses. Our findings remained stable, indicating
that reverse causality is unlikely to fully explain the observed
associations. Residual confounding or confounding by unmea-
sured variables is always a limitation in observational research.
In most studies on this topic, analyses were only adjusted
for sociodemographic factors. However, we modeled a broad
range of variables that may confound or possibly lie on the
pathway linking optimism to disease outcomes, including
sociodemographic factors, health conditions, health beha-
viors, depression, and depressive symptoms. The relation
of optimism to mortality remained statistically significant
across all analyses. Finally, our sample included mainly
white women, and therefore our results might not be gener-
alizable to minorities or men; however, there is no clear
basis for believing that the effects of optimism on health dif-
fer by sex or race.
This study also has considerable strengths. The large and
richly characterized cohort permitted adjustment for a large
number of potential confounders, consideration of numer-
ous additional variables, including factors known to con-
tribute to optimism, and examination of more causes of
death than has previously been possible.
In summary, optimism was broadly and robustly associ-
ated with a lower risk of mortality. Most importantly, in
terms of public health, randomized trials have demon-
strated that optimism can be altered with relatively uncom-
plicated interventions (12–16). Tested interventions range
from structured classroom-style instruction and activities to
brief paper-and-pencil exercises in which people are asked
to write about a best possible version of themselves. Most
of the interventions developed to date were evaluated in
younger samples, and their durability has not been exam-
ined with longer follow-up times or with major chronic dis-
ease outcomes. Findings from the present study suggest the
potential value of evaluating these interventions and their
effectiveness among older individuals in the general popu-
lation. Our finding that optimism is associated with a wide
range of causes of mortality adds to a growing evidence
base that optimism plays an important role in health and
longevity, further supporting the possibility that optimism

 could be a novel target for future research on prevention
and intervention strategies aimed at improving public
health.
