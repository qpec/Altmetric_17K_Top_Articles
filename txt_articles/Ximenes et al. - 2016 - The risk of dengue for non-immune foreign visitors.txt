Abstract
Background: Rio de Janeiro in Brazil will host the Summer Olympic Games in 2016. About 400,000 non-immune
foreign tourists are expected to attend the games. As Brazil is the country with the highest number of dengue
cases worldwide, concern about the risk of dengue for travelers is justified.
Methods: A mathematical model to calculate the risk of developing dengue for foreign tourists attending the
Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 is proposed. A system of differential equation models the spread of
dengue amongst the resident population and a stochastic approximation is used to assess the risk to tourists.
Historical reported dengue time series in Rio de Janeiro for the years 2000-2015 is used to find out the time
dependent force of infection, which is then used to estimate the potential risks to a large tourist cohort. The worst
outbreak of dengue occurred in 2012 and this and the other years in the history of Dengue in Rio are used to
discuss potential risks to tourists amongst visitors to the forthcoming Rio Olympics.
Results: The individual risk to be infected by dengue is very much dependent on the ratio asymptomatic/
symptomatic considered but independently of this the worst month of August in the period studied in terms of
dengue transmission, occurred in 2007.
Conclusions: If dengue returns in 2016 with the pattern observed in the worst month of August in history (2007),
the expected number of symptomatic and asymptomatic dengue cases among tourists will be 23 and 206 cases,
respectively. This worst case scenario would have an incidence of 5.75 (symptomatic) and 51.5 (asymptomatic) per
100,000 individuals.

Background
Brazil will host the Summer Olympic Games, which will
take place mainly in Rio de Janeiro, to be held between
August 5–21, 2016, followed by the summer Paralympics,
between 7–18 September. (http://www.rio2016.com/en).
The Olympics is expected to attract some 400,000 foreign
visitors in addition to about 600,000 domestic supporters
from other states of Brazil. Mass gatherings such as the
Olympics are of particular public health concern as infec-
tious diseases can rapidly affect large numbers of persons
[1]. Dengue is a viral infection caused by 4 dengue sero-
types (DENV 1–4) transmitted by mosquitoes that is an
increasing problem in Brazil and other countries in the
tropics and subtropics [2]. As Brazil is the country with
the highest number of dengue cases worldwide [3, 4],
concern about the risk of dengue for travelers is justified.
Indeed, dengue was the most frequent cause of systemic
febrile illness in travelers to Brazil, reported in almost 6 %
of returning travelers with any illness from Brazil as docu-
mented by GeoSentinel, a global network of travel
medicine providers [5]. Hence, the FIFA World Football

 Cup that took place in Brazil in 2014 motivated extensive
scientific and media communication around the potential
risk of dengue to foreign visitors [6–12]. One modelling
study predicted the risk to foreign visitors to be as high as
33 (varying from 3 to 59) in 607,051 attendees at the foot-
ball games [7]. Fortunately, the year 2014 was a year of
unusually low dengue incidence in all the cities hosting
the games, and in the end only 3 cases were documented
by the Brazilian authorities, one in a Japanese citizen and
2 in US citizens [13].
Dengue outbreaks shows a strong periodical pattern
within a year because of the influence of temperature
and precipitation on mosquito abundance and vectorial
capacity [14, 15] and also because a threshold in the
proportion of susceptible may be reached [ArXhiV:
submitted]. Dengue epidemics are often difficult to pre-
dict but easy to understand. Epidemic dengue transmis-
sion differs from year to year, often presenting a cyclical
pattern. A year with high dengue activity is often
followed by a year with lower incidence due to herd im-
munity. In adition, the interaction between climate and
dengue activity is not linear, because population density,
socio-economic conditions, sanitation and people mo-
bility also play major roles in dengue epidemiology.
There are also genotypic changes and introduction of
new sero-and genotypes [16].
Dengue virus (DENV) was reintroduced into Brazil in
1981 and by 1995 it had spread throughout the country
[3, 4]. Dengue cases, and many other compulsory notifi-
able infectious diseases, are weekly reported to the offi-
cial reporting system of the Brazilian Ministry of Health
(called SINAN) database. More than 7 million dengue
cases have been reported in Brazil, and Brazil is now the
country with the highest dengue incidence in the world
[17]. By 2007 the number of dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) cases had more than doubled [18]. The three
dengue serotypes, DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 haven
been circulating widely in Brazil for years, but in 2011
DENV-4 invaded the country and in 2012 the highest
incidence was reported to date, 95 % of which were due
to DENV-1 and DENV-4 (dtr2004.saude.gov.br/sinan
web/tabnet/dh?sinannet/dengue/bases/denguebrnet.def).
Figure 1 shows the year-to-year oscillations of dengue
outbreaks.
Figure 2 shows the number of accumulated dengue
cases in the period between 2000 and 2015 in Rio, corre-
sponding to the data observed in Fig. 1.
This figure shows several features that will be analyzed
in another paper. From it, we see that DENV-3 started
in 2000 and circulated until 2007. In 2008, until 2010,
DENV-2 predominated. From 2011 until 2015, two sero-
types, DENV-1 and DENV-4 started circulating. Note
that the number of cases in the last outbreaks is about
twice as high as the number of cases observed in previous
outbreaks. This strongly suggests that the two serotypes
do not compete against each other.
Rio de Janeiro, the venue for the 2016 Olympic
Games, has been of major importance for the epidemi-
ology of dengue in Brazil. After the DENV 1–4 introduc-
tions in 1986, 1990, 2000 and 2011, respectively, the city
has suffered explosive outbreaks [19].
Properly quantifying the risk of dengue for foreign visi-
tors to the Olympics is important. On one hand, we want
to avoid the overly alarming news and overestimates of
dengue that circulated before the 2014 FIFA World Cup
in Brazil [6–9], on the other hand, we want to be
adequately prepared for the Summer Olympics. In this
paper we propose to estimate the risk of dengue for for-
eign visitors attending the summer Olympics in Rio de
Janeiro in 2016, in the period between the 30th and 32nd
epidemiological week of the year. We also discuss the
Fig. 1 Number of reported cases of dengue in Rio de Janeiro in the
period January 2000-July 2014. Data from SINAN (the Brazilian
national notifiable diseases system)
Fig. 2 Accumulated number of reported dengue cases in Rio de
Janeiro, 2000-2015. We assume that the segments of the curve
that show no increase in the cases are cases where a threshold
of susceptible was reached. Note also that there are changes in
the slope of the curve that indicate the epidemics propagating
through the city. Finally the number of accumulated cases in the
last outbreak twice the number of the previous ones. This
indicates two virus circulating without competition. This
matter is analyzed in [arXiv: submitted]

 strength and limitations of the model taking into account
the experiences with the models proposed for estimating
the risk of dengue during the FIFA World Cup in 2014.
Methods
We propose a stochastic model for the calculation of the
per capita probability of dengue infection for visitors to
Rio de Janeiro in period between the 30th and the 32nd
epidemiological week of the year 2016. The model is
based on the calculated force of infection, averaged over
the entire city for each years since the year 2000. The
risk of dengue during the 3 first weeks of the months of
August of each year of the historical series analyzed was
then calculated.
The Model for dengue among the local inhabitants of Rio
de Janeiro
The model assumes that the population of humans and
mosquitoes are subdivided into: susceptible humans SH,
infected humans IH, recovered (and immune) humans
RH, total humans NH, susceptible mosquitoes SV, infected
and latent mosquitoes LV, and infected and infectious
mosquitoes IV. The dynamics of an ideal model is de-
scribed by the set of equations shown in Table 1 [20].
In Table 1, a is the daily biting rate of the mosquitoes
(that is, the average number of bites each mosquito inflicts
in the human hosts), b is the proportion (that is, a prob-
ability) of infected bites that are actually infective for
humans, c is the proportion (that is, a probability) of bites
that are due to infective mosquitoes, μ is the mortality rate
of humans, γ is daily the recovery rate of humans, μV is
the daily mortality rate of mosquitoes, 1/γV is the average
latency period in days in the mosquitoes and α is the
dengue induced daily mortality rate of humans. The quan-
tities SH, IH, RH, etc., are densities [21] and although very
simple, this model can reproduce most of the characteris-
tics of dengue outbreaks among visitors [22].
Calculating the per capita probability of infection
Assuming a closed population of size N in the absence
of competitive risks, the risk of infection can be stochas-
tically calculated by a two state model without recovery.
Such a Susceptible-Infected (SI) model is one in which S
individuals are susceptible to the infection and I individ-
uals are those who acquired the infection, remaining in-
fected for life. This is an approximation to the dengue
reality and it is justified by the fact that visitors are in
relatively low number with respect with the local popu-
lation and they spend a relatively short period of time in
the visited place. Visitors, therefore, are assumed to be
subject to the local force of infection but do not contrib-
ute to it. The consequence of this assumption is that we
can use a linear model, which simplifies the calculation
of the risk of infection. The details of the risk calculation
are shown in Table 2.
In a model such as the one shown in Table 2, that
excludes any competitive risks (that is, neither recovery/
death before returning home nor returning home before
recovering from the infection), the PGF (5) is the PGF of
a Binomial Distribution (susceptibles either acquire the
infection or not) with N trials and probability of success
π given by (7) and variance given by (9).
Table 2 A stochastic SI approximation to the risk of dengue for
visitors
Let us start by calculating the probability that x individuals are in the
state S and y individuals are in the state I at time t + Δt:
Px,y(t + Δt) = Px,y(t)(1 − λxΔt) + Px + 1,y − 1λ(x + 1)Δt
(2)
In equation (2) the first term refers to the probability that there
were x and y individuals at time t in the states S and I respectively, and
that no susceptible individuals x acquired the infection in the period.
The second term refers to the probability that there were (x + 1) and
(y-1) individuals at time t in the states S and I respectively, and that one
susceptible individual acquired the infection in the period.
From equation (2) it follows that:

The general expression for the Probability Generation Function
(PGF), G(u,v,t), is given by:
G(u, v, t) = ∑y = 0

uxvyPx,y(t).
(4)
For the particular model expressed in equation (4) it is possible
to deduce that the PGF is:
G(u, v, t) = [(u − v)e− λt + v]N..
(5)
Now the average number of infected individuals, y, at time t can be
calculated by taking the first partial derivative of the PGF with respect

 The force of infection of dengue, however, shows a
marked oscillation with a peak in the end of the summer,
decreasing thereafter. Therefore, to determine the risk of
dengue for visitors in the period of the Olympic Games
(August 2016) it is necessary to take this into account,
and equation (7) now becomes equation (10), shown in
Table 3:
In Table 3, tourists are assumed to arrive at time ω,
remaining in Rio until time ω + Ω, when they leave.
Note that the dynamics of dengue are actually given by
the set of equations (1) which is a host-vector model in
which the epidemiological dynamics of the human popula-
tion is of Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) type. How-
ever the timescale on which the epidemiological changes
occur is typically very long compared with the short mos-
quito lifecycle.
The probability that each visitor develops dengue, there-
fore, is given by equation (10) of Table 3. Thus the num-
ber of dengue cases amongst tourists is again Binomial
with parameters N and p = π(ω,Ω).
So we need to find λ(t), to finally calculate the risk value
for visitors. Therefore, we rewrite the first two equations
of system (1), as shown by system (11) in Table 4.
In Table 4, the force of infection λ(t) = abIV/NH is the
rate of attack of a single susceptible individual at time t
and λ(t)S(t) is the dengue incidence (SINAN data) new
cases per time unit.
Estimating the Force of Infection of Dengue in Rio de
Janeiro
In this section we show how to estimate the force of in-
fection of dengue in Rio de Janeiro. We assume that visi-
tors attending the Olympic Games are subject to the
same force of infection of dengue as the local residents.
This is a strong assumption and it is based on the obser-
vation that, on the one hand, some of the tourists tend
to be hosted in hotels with air conditioning and there-
fore with less contact with the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
On the other hand, a growing number of tourists prefer
to stay in the shanty towns of Rio, subject to high expos-
ure to the mosquitoes. Hence, on average, tourists are
expected to receive the same number of potentially in-
fective bites as local residents. The result of this assump-
tion is an upper bound of the expected risk to visitors.
The force of infection of dengue in Rio de Janeiro
shows a marked oscillatory behavior with cases starting
to grow early in January, peaking in late April, and
declining thereafter. By considering the notified number
of weekly cases reported to the SINAN database from
2000 until 2015, we can calculate the time-dependent
force of infection of dengue year by year in this period
of 16 years.
To estimate the force of infection of dengue in Rio in
the years analyzed, we modeled the time-dependent force
of infection as a function with the “corrected Gaussian”
form, as shown in Table 5:
To obtain the risk of dengue for foreign visitors we
fitted to the data incidence to the continuous function
(12) for the force of infection λ(t), such that when used in
the model (11) reproduces the SINAN incidence data. As
mentioned in the Introduction, in Brazil, dengue cases,
and many other infectious diseases are compulsorily noti-
fied. The number of weekly cases are reported to the offi-
cial depository system of the Brazilian Ministry of Health
(SINAN) database. In this paper it is assumed that all clin-
ical (symptomatic) dengue cases are notified and, there-
fore, SINAN is assumed to be equal to λ(t)S(t). This is the
quantity that is reproduced by the model. Of course it is
also necessary to estimate, after each outbreak, an initial
number of susceptible individuals, S(0), in order to obtain
the incidence of dengue notification in the next outbreak.
This is estimated as follows.
The total population of Rio de Janeiro in 2000 was
obtained from the census of National Statistics in Dem-
ography Institute of Brazil as 5,857,904 inhabitants. The
next national census was carried out in 2010 and the
total number of inhabitants increased to 6,317,424 indi-
viduals. As explained below, we need the total popula-
tion in each years, which was obtained by interpolation
in between. After 2010, the total population was extrap-
olated from the two precedents censuses.

 In order to obtain the initial conditions S(0) for Rio for
each year we first projected the expected number of inhabi-
tants and discounted the number of dengue cases reported
in the previous year. This was carried out for the years
2000 until 2007 because in this period serotype 3 predomi-
nated in Rio. For 2008, the total projected population size
was used because a new serotype started circulating
(DENV-2), to which all inhabitants were assumed suscep-
tible. For 2009 and 2010 the same procedures of discount-
ing the number of cases in the previous years was applied
because DENV-2 circulated along these 3 years. In 2011,
serotypes 1 and 4 were introduced and the initial condition
assumed for simulating the years 2011–2015 were obtained
first, by doubling the projected population for 2011 (there
were 2 virus circulating) and for 2012–2015 by discounting
the number of cases reported in the previous years.
One important aspect to be considered, however, is
the expected number of asymptomatic dengue infec-
tions, which has been subject of some publications
recently. The ratio asymptomatic/symptomatic varies
from 2 to 10 according to references [23] and [24]. In
addition, there is now evidence suggesting that those
asymptomatic individuals are equally or even more
transmissible to the mosquitoes [25]. Therefore, we sim-
ulated 2 scenarios with the ratios symptomatic/asymp-
tomatic as equal to 1:1 and 1:4.
Table 6 summarize the above procedures.
In the table the 3rd column is the calculated size of the
population of Rio in each year. The 4th column is the
number of reported (symptomatic) cases. The 5th column
is the initial number of susceptibles, S(0), calculated by
subtracting the total population the number of reported
cases considering that there was no asymptomatic cases.
Column 6th recalculated S(0) by considering that the ratio
symptomatic/asymptomatic was 1:4.
For instance, for 2001 we considered S(0) as the total
population of 2000 minus the number of reported cases
in the previous year for the ratio 1:1, minus 2 times the
number of reported cases in 2000, and so on for the
other ratios considered.
Summarizing, we fitted equations (12) and (13) to
obtain the parameters ci(i = 1,...5) that, when applied to
the set of equations (11), assuming as initial conditions for
the number of susceptible individuals, S(0), as explained
above, retrieves the incidence of new cases reported per
week in the SINAN (λ(t)S(t)) database. Figure 3 shows the
quality of the fitting procedure for 2012, the worst year in
terms of dengue incidence in Rio de Janeiro for the case
were no asymptomatic infections was considered.
Results
The results of the above calculations are summarized in
Tables 7 and 8, which shows the individual risks of infec-
tion for travelers and the expected number of cases for
each one of the scenarios simulated, respectively.
Discussion
In this paper we propose a model for estimating the indi-
vidual risk of dengue infection for non-immune visitors
attending the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de

 Janeiro, Brazil. An SIR model is used for describing the
spread of dengue among local inhabitants and a stochastic
simplification, assuming an SI structure, was applied to
estimate the individual risk of dengue for travelers. The
force of infection for the period of the games was calcu-
lated by assuming a Gaussian-type function that was fitted
to the actual dengue notification system in the country.
The maximum risk for travelers, assuming an incidence at
the time of the 2016 games as equal to worst month of
August (2007) in terms of dengue in Rio, was calculated
to be 5.84x10-5 (95 % CI: 5.21x10−5−6.47x10−5) and
5.14x10−4 (95 % CI: 4.94x10−4−5.34x10−4) for a 1:1 and 1:4
symptomatic/asymptomatic ratios, respectively. The fact
that the worst month of August occurred in 2007, a year
with a relatively low number of dengue cases deserves an
explanation. Although the worst dengue year in the histor-
ical set studied was 2012, in 2007, the month of August
showed a high remaining number of dengue cases and the
following dengue season had already started. This was
probably due to climatic factors because the average
maximum, mean and minimum temperatures recorded
for the month of August in 2007 were 3 centigrade
degrees higher than 2012 (29, 23 and 20 versus 26, 20 and
18, respectively). This may have result in a higher density
of mosquitoes and consequently higher intensity of
transmission in that particular year.
This individual risk when scaled to the expected
400,000 non-immune visitors would translate into the
expected number of visitors who would acquire a
dengue infection during the Olympic Games.
The model relies on several assumptions, namely, that
visitors are subject to the same force of infection as the
local residents; the visitors are in relatively low number
with respect to the local population; visitors spend a
relatively short period in Rio de Janeiro and, therefore,
do not contribute to the local force of infection; and,
finally, there is no competitive risk for travelers, like
returning home before acquiring the infection.
We would like to emphasize that our main result is
the individual probability that a non-immune traveller
acquire the infection. With this probability any individ-
ual may decide whether he/she will come to Rio. This
individual probability of infection (Table 7) allows the
calculation of having any number of travellers N will
result in n ≤ N infections.
To estimate the expected number of travellers that get
dengue we explicitly assume (including the title) that all
visitors are non-immune. This produces an upper bound
to the average number of expected cases/infections.
With respect to immune visitors from dengue endemic
countries, we have the following observations:
1) those individuals must come from South-East Asia,
Africa or South America, the endemic regions of
dengue;
2) judging from the number of visitors attending the
World Cup in 2014, from the 700,000 foreign
visitors, about half came from South America. The
remaining came either from Europe or North
America. African and South-Eastern Asians were a
small minority, in some cases only represented by
the athletes themselves.
Therefore, the expected number of cases/infections
could be cut by about half.
Unfortunately, all the four serotypes of dengue are
circulating in South American countries and the propor-
tion of immune individuals is unknown and in some
cases subject to errors. Therefore, we consider only
400,000 that are roughly the estimation of non-immune
visitors.
The main shortcoming with epidemiological forecasting
is to establish the extent to which the past is likely to be
an accurate guide to the future [26]. There are many
unpredictable factors that generate uncertainties at many
levels, and often policy makers have to rely on information
of previous outbreaks in order to make decisions that are
at high stake, both in terms of health and economics.
Woolhouse proposes 4 scenarios for forecasting. (1) Data
and values of parameters for previous outbreaks are
assumed to be valid for future episodes and the structure
of the model is assumed to be valid as well, in other words
there is no change; (2) There may be changes in the
dengue serotype circulating at the moment of the fore-
casting, or in the intensity of transmission, or in climate
condition for the breeding of mosquitoes, in other words
the input data change; (3) The parameter values change,
such as the force of infection of dengue as determined by
the density of infected mosquitoes with respect to human
hosts and the biting rate. These kinds of changes would

 be difficult to quantify a priori, and new parameter values
may need to be estimated from earlier epidemic data; and
(4) the model changes, which means the original model
structure or assumptions are incorrect for the new
epidemic.
All or some of these factors may explain the failure to
accurately predict the number of dengue cases for the
World Cup 2014 in Brazil, and the forecasting for the
Olympic Games is not immune to them. We show that
the year 2014 experienced a particularly low dengue in-
cidence and when we run our model for that year (but
after the event of the World Cup) we see that zero to a
handful of cases during the World Cup was a likely pos-
sibility. Climatic events such as a severe drought in 2014
could explain the low incidence of dengue in that year
but other factors could have contributed as well.
The accuracy of any attempt to forecast the number of
dengue cases for the Olympic Games in 2016 will very

 much depend on the intensity of transmission. This in
turn is dependent on changes in the serotype circulating,
climate conditions and host behavior. Furthermore, the
Olympic Games will motivate public health practitioners
to intensify vector control measures around the Games,
thereby reducing the risk of dengue in the vicinity of the
Games. In addition, the oscillatory distribution of cases is
of upmost importance for the risk of dengue during the
period of time of the Olympic Games. As can be seen in
Fig. 1 the years of 2002 and 2008 showed the highest
peaks in the number of cases but these were concentrated
during the summer season. With the exception of 2007,
the month of August in those years showed a very low
incidence of dengue and hence the low expected number
of cases projected for the Olympics in Table 8. Hence, if
we apply the same level of dengue over the last 15 years,
the expected number of symptomatic dengue among non-
immune visitors attending the Olympic Games in Rio de
Janeiro in 2016 will vary depending on the intensity of
transmission of dengue in the month of August. This, in
turn, will depend on climatic factors and the number of
infected mosquitoes in that particular month.
After we finished the revision of the original manu-
script Brazil has been overwhelmed by an apparently
huge outbreak of Zika virus. This triggered a wave of
concern around the world, in particular due to the
still to be confirmed association with microcephaly in
babies born from mothers infected with Zika. The
calculations provided by the present work could rep-
resent an important step toward understanding and
quantifying the risk of exposure to Zika for travellers
visiting Rio during the Olympic Games and eventually
bitten by Aedes mosquitoes. Preliminary calculations
suggest a very low individual risk on the order of
2x10-6 but this is still based on incomplete informa-
tion. As soon as more information on Zika incidence
in Brazil is known through new and reliable diagnos-
tic methods we intend to calculate the risk of Zika
infection for travellers visiting Brazil any time in the
future
Conclusions
If dengue returns in 2016 with the pattern observed in the
worst month of August in history (2007), the expected
number of symptomatic and asymptomatic dengue cases
among tourists will be 23 and 206 cases, respectively. This
worst case scenario would have an incidence of 5.75
(symptomatic) and 51.5 (asymptomatic) per 100,000
individuals.
Preliminary calculations on the risk of Zika virus infec-
tion for tourists suggest a very low individual risk on the
order of 2x10−6 but this is still based on incomplete
information.
