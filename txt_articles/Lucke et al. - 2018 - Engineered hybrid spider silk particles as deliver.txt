Recombinant silk protein
The generation of strong T-cell immunity is one of the main challenges for the development of successful 
vaccines against cancer and major infectious diseases. Here we have engineered spider silk particles as 
delivery system for a peptide-based vaccination that leads to effective priming of cytotoxic T-cells. The 
recombinant spider silk protein eADF4(C16) was fused to the antigenic peptide from ovalbumin, either 
without linker or with a cathepsin cleavable peptide linker. Particles prepared from the hybrid proteins 
were taken up by dendritic cells, which are essential for T-cell priming, and successfully activated 
cytotoxic T-cells, without signs of immunotoxicity or unspecific immunostimulatory activity. Upon 
subcutaneous injection in mice, the particles were taken up by dendritic cells and accumulated in the 
lymph nodes, where immune responses are generated. Particles from hybrid proteins containing a 
cathepsin-cleavable linker induced a strong antigen-specific proliferation of cytotoxic T-cells in vivo, 
even in the absence of a vaccine adjuvant. We thus demonstrate the efficacy of a new vaccine strategy 
using a protein-based all-in-one vaccination system, where spider silk particles serve as carriers with an 
incorporated peptide antigen. Our study further suggests that engineered spider silk-based vaccines are 
extremely stable, easy to manufacture, and readily customizable.
1. Introduction
Vaccination prevents the spread of many deadly infectious dis-
eases, and it is considered to be one of the most effective in-
terventions for global health ever developed [1]. The protective
effect of vaccines is essentially due to B lymphocyte production of
neutralizing
antibodies
against
infectious
agents
or
toxins.
Although in many infectious diseases this humoral immunity is of
major importance, in some cases cellular immunity is essential for
protection [2]. Indeed, cytotoxic T-cells, the main effector cells of
cellular immunity, are required for the development of successful
immune responses against chronic infections such as HIV, malaria

 or tuberculosis [3]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that T-
cell-mediated immunity can lead to cancer regression in patients,
even in the case of advanced disease [4]. Unfortunately, most cur-
rent vaccination strategies do not induce effective cytotoxic T-cell
responses and the development of vaccines that promote cellular
immunity thus remains a major challenge [5].
The initiation of cytotoxic T-cell responses requires the priming
of naïve CD8þ T-cells by professional antigen-presenting cells such
as dendritic cells [6,7]. Dendritic cells are located in many tissues
and constantly sample their surroundings. When these cells
encounter microbes or particulate matter, or indeed vaccination-
delivered antigens, these are engulfed and processed in order to
cross-present antigenic peptides to T-cells via major histocompat-
ibility complex class I molecules (MHC I) [8,9]. To induce effective
immunity, immature dendritic cells must be activated by specific
maturation signals [10]. For this reason, in addition to microbial
antigens, most vaccines include adjuvants that stimulate dendritic
cell maturation and thus the generation of cytotoxic T-cell immu-
nity [11,12]. The maturation of dendritic cells occurs during their
migration from peripheral tissues to the lymph nodes [13]. In the
lymph nodes, CD8þ T-cells are primed by direct contact with
mature dendritic cells presenting their cognate antigen [14].
Primed T-cells proliferate in the lymph nodes and differentiate to
effector cytotoxic T-cells that patrol the body to kill infected or
tumoral cells.
The elucidation of the amino acid sequences of microbial or
tumor-associated antigens has led to the development of peptide
vaccination [15]. Vaccines comprised of antigenic peptides instead
of full-length proteins activate only the cytotoxic T-cells that
recognize disease-specific epitopes, thus limiting the risk of un-
specific autoimmune toxicity. However, peptide vaccination has
shown limited success due to several factors. First, peptides are
rapidly degraded by proteases: the MelanA/MART-1 tumor anti-
genic peptide for instance is degraded in 22 s in plasma [16]. Sec-
ond, peptides can bind to MHC I not only on antigen-presenting
cells but on all nucleated cells, thus promoting tolerance rather
than immunity [17,18]. Furthermore, to be effective the vaccine
peptides must form a stable complex with MHC I molecules during
dendritic cell migration to the lymph node [19,20], which takes
approximatively 18 h [21]. To meet these challenges, antigens can
be protected by particulate carriers. Particle delivery systems can
limit peptide degradation, improve uptake of antigen by dendritic
cells [22] and ensure that the antigen is processed intracellularly
before loading onto MHC I [23].
For the design of particle-based delivery systems, antigen can be
coupled to the particles by different methods [24]. The antigen may
be adsorbed to the surface of the particle, as is the case with
aluminum-based formulations [25]. However, binding by non-
covalent interactions may result in rapid antigen release from the
carrier upon changes in pH. The antigen can also be encapsulated in
a polymer matrix during manufacturing, but this may damage
protein-based antigens due to the relatively harsh conditions
commonly applied during particle preparation [26]. Chemical
conjugation of the antigen to the carrier bears the risk of losing
certain epitopes during conjugation [27]. To circumvent these dif-
ficulties, we chose to use a protein-based carrier and directly
incorporated the antigenic peptide into the sequence of the carrier
protein derived from spider silk. Spider silk protein is a promising
material, because previous studies demonstrated that the protein
itself is poorly immunogenic and does not cause inflammatory re-
actions in rats [28,29]. Indeed, in addition to their clear advantage
in terms of biocompatibility and biodegradability, spider silk par-
ticles allow for solvent-free synthesis and steam sterilization
[30,31].
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of spider silk hybrid proteins
eADF4(C16) is based on 16 repeats of the consensus sequence of
spidroin ADF4 of the European garden spider (Araneus dia-
dematus)
(C-module:
GSSAAAAAAAASGPGGY
GPENQGPSGPG-
GYGPGGPG), and a T7-tag fused to the amino terminus for
detection purposes [32]. OVA257-264 peptide (SIINFEKL) was fused
to the eADF4(C16) by either using a cathepsin B cleavable linker
(GFLG) or a cathepsin S cleavable linker (PMGLP). Fusions were
made using tags and DNA sequences of the tags were inserted into
the cloning vector pCS of eADF4(C16) by seamless cloning as
described previously [31,32]. The resulting constructs and the
modified proteins are shown in Fig. S1. Successful cloning was
confirmed by sequencing.
2.2. Preparation of spider silk hybrid particles
Preparation of spider silk hybrid particles was performed using
the well-established preparation technique using a micromixing
system as described before [33]. Briefly, spider silk protein powders
were dissolved in a 6 M guanidinium thiocyanate solution and
subsequently dialyzed against a 10 mM Tris/HCl solution. The dia-
lyzed solution was 0.2 mm filtered before particle preparation. The
particle preparation was subsequently conducted by mixing pre-
tempered spider silk protein solution (1 mg/ml) with either a pre-
tempered 2 M potassium phosphate solution or 2e4 M ammo-
nium sulfate solution. Resulting spider silk particles were washed
with highly purified water (HPW) three times followed by a two-
minute ultrasonication treatment.
2.2.1. Preparation of spider silk hybrid particles for in vitro and
in vivo studies
The before mentioned particle preparation process was slightly
adjusted for particles used during in vitro and in vivo experiments.
Prior to dissolution in 6 M guanidinium thiocyanate the spider silk
powder was suspended in HPW and steam sterilized for 15 min at
121 �C. In addition, chemicals with low endotoxin levels were used
throughout the whole preparation process. Endotoxin content of
the protein solution was determined using an Endosafe-PTS reader
(Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, USA) after a 20e40-fold
dilution with HPW.
2.3. Particle sterilization
Suspensions of spider silk particles were sterilized by autoclave
treatment in a GTA 50 autoclave (Fritz G€
ossner, Hamburg, Ger-
many) as described before [34]. All spider silk particles were sus-
pended in highly purified water at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.
Sterilization was performed for 15 min at 121 �C.
2.4. Fluorescent labelling
Labelling of spider silk protein with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) was performed based on the published method by Spieß
et al. using the terminal amine group of the spider silk protein [30].
For the preparation of fluorescently labeled particles used for
in vivo studies, an endotoxin-free 20 mM HEPES solution instead of
a 10 mM Tris/HCl solution was used for dialysis to facilitate the
coupling of FITC. After dialysis, a 20-fold molar excess of FITC
(dissolved in DMSO) was added slowly to the spider silk solution
followed by a 3 h incubation in the dark. The FITC-coupled spider
silk protein solution was used for particle preparation as described
before. The fluorescent labelling of particles used for in vitro studies
2
http://doc.rero.ch
 only was carried out at pre-prepared particles. Spider silk particles
were suspended at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in an endotoxin-
free 20 mM HEPES buffer. A 20-fold molar excess of FITC (dis-
solved in DMSO) was added dropwise to the particle suspension.
After incubation for 72 h in the dark, the particles were centrifuged
and washed with HPW for three times. Additional ultrasonication
for 2 min completed the preparation process.
2.5. Release of OVA peptide from hybrid spider silk particles by
cathepsin cleavage
The C16-catSsub-OVAp particles were suspended to a final
concentration of 2 mg/ml with a 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH
5.5, containing 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM DTT. To this suspension, 0.9
mU/ml (5 ng/ml) cathepsin S was added for incubation at 37 �C [35].
As suggested by Calbiochem, the pH of the before mentioned ace-
tate buffer was adjusted to 5.0 for incubation with cathepsin B
enzyme. 0.1 U/ml (0.36 ng/ml) cathepsin B was added to C16-
catBsub-OVAp particles for incubation at 37 �C [36]. Samples
were drawn after 1, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h incubation time and
analyzed by RP-HPLC. To do so, the sample supernatant was sepa-
rated by a Waters 2695 module (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA,
USA) equipped with a reversed phase YMC-Triart C18 column (YMC
Europe GmbH, Dinslaken, Germany). Peptide detection was carried
out at 220 nm on a Waters UVeVis detector 2487 (Waters Corpo-
ration, Milford, MA, USA). Peptides with the predicted cleavage
sequence were used for standard curves. The cleavage sites of the
linkers had been described in literature earlier [35,37,38]. The
peptide IGSIINFEKLG was used for evaluation of C16-catBsub-OVAp
protein and the peptide LPGSIINFEKLG was used for evaluation of
C16-catSsub-OVAp protein, respectively. Data analysis was per-
formed using Chromeleon 6.80 software (Dionex GmbH, Germer-
ing, Germany).
2.6. Dynamic light scattering (DLS)
Particle size and size distribution of submicroparticles were
measured in triplicate by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a
Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK).
Particle size is provided as the Z-average value, and the particle size
distribution is displayed by the polydispersity index (PDI). Directly
before each measurement, samples were diluted to a final con-
centration of 0.01 mg/ml with HPW. All measurements were con-
ducted at 25 �C.
2.7. Zeta potential
The zeta potential of spider silk particles was measured using a
disposable capillary cell (DTS1061, Malvern Instruments, Worces-
tershire, United Kingdom) in a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern In-
struments, Worcestershire, United Kingdom). The spider silk
particle samples were diluted to 0.05 mg/ml with freshly prepared
20 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) solution for analysis [33,39]. The
measurements were conducted in triplicate at 25 �C.
2.8. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
For SEM imaging, small droplets of spider silk particle suspen-
sions were placed onto Thermanox® plastic cover slips (Nunc,
Rochester, USA). The spider silk particle suspensions were dried
and carbon sputtered under vacuum at room temperature. Analysis
was performed using a Joel JSM-6500F microscope (Joel Inc., Pea-
body, USA) at magnifications of 20,000�.
2.9. Mice
Female C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier Labs, Roubaix, France) and OT-I
mice (C57BL/6-Tg (TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/Crl; Charles River, Wilming-
ton, USA) were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and
used at 6e12 weeks of age. Animal experimentation was conducted
according to Swiss regulations.
2.10. Cell culture
Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) and single-cell
suspensions of primary splenocytes were prepared as described
[40], plated in flat-bottom 96-well plates (5x104 cells/well) and
exposed to spider silk particles at a working concentration of 50 mg/
ml (¼ 1 mg OVA peptide/ml) except for cytotoxicity testing (500 mg/
ml). At 500 mg/ml, particles did not interfere with ELISA or flow
cytometry reading [41]. OVA peptide (1 mg/ml) was used as control.
Staurosporine (1 nM) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, USA) was used as
positive control to induce apoptosis (not shown). Lipopolysaccha-
ride (LPS) (100 ng/ml) and resiquimod (R848; 0.25 mg/ml) (both
from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) were used as adjuvant to induce
BMDC maturation. After 24 h particle exposure, cells were har-
vested for flow cytometry analysis, and the supernatant was stored
at �20 �C for cytokine quantification.
2.11. Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry analysis was performed with a MACSquant
analyzer 10 (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). To
assess cell viability, BMDC were incubated with annexin V-APC
(Biolegend, San Diego, USA) according to the manufacturer's in-
structions. Propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, USA) was
automatically added by the MACSquant analyzer before analysis.
For other flow cytometry measurements, cells were stained with
zombie violet dye (Biolegend, San Diego, USA) to exclude dead cells
and washed with FACS buffer consisting of PBS (Eurobio, Les Ulis,
France) supplemented with 2 mM EDTA (Calbiochem, San Diego,
USA) and 0.5% BSA (PAA laboratories, Austria). Fc receptors were
blocked by incubation with anti-mouse unlabeled CD16/32 (Bio-
legend, San Diego, USA) for 10 min at 4 �C before addition of anti-
mouse labeled antibodies for further 30 min at 4 �C: APC-Cy7-
MHC
II/I-A/I-E
(M5/114.15.2),
PB-CD3
(17A2),
APC-Cy7-CD8
(53e6.7), PerCP-B220/CD45R (RA3-6B2), Pe-Cy7-Cd11c (N418),
APC-CD11b (M1/70), APC-CD11c (N418) (all from Biolegend) and
APC-MCH-I/H.2Kb (AF6-88.5.5.3) (ebioscience, San Diego, USA).
Corresponding isotype controls were used (data not shown). The
cells were washed once and resuspended in FACS buffer before
acquisition. BMDC were defined as CD11cþ cells. The following
splenocyte subpopulations were defined: T-cells (CD3þB220�),
dendritic cells (CD3�B220�CD11cþ) and macrophages/monocytes
(CD3�B220�CD11c�CD11bþ). Data were analyzed using FlowJo
software version 9.9.4 (FlowJo Analysis software, Ashland, USA).
2.12. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay
The vybrant MTT cell proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, USA) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol.
MTT was added to BMDC after 24 h of particle exposure. For this
assay, complete BMDC medium without phenol red (Bio West,
Nuaill�
e, France) was used.
2.13. Analysis of cytokine production by ELISA
ELISA Max deluxe sets for mouse IL-6, TNF-a and IFN-g (all from
3
http://doc.rero.ch
 Biolegend, San Diego, USA) were used according to the manufac-
turer's protocol. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured and sub-
tracted from the absorbance at 450 nm using an Infinite 200 PRO
plate-reader (TECAN, M€
annedorf, Switzerland). Standard curves
were performed in duplicate.
2.14. Confocal microscopy
1.5 � 105 BMDC were incubated with Blue DND-22 LysoTracker
(1:1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, USA) in 300 mL complete BMDC
medium without phenol red in Lab-Tek II 8-chambered coverglass
1.5 system (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). After 1 h, FITC-labeled par-
ticles (50.5 mg/ml) were added for an additional 4 h before live cell
imaging by confocal microscopy (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at
20� and 60� magnification
2.15. In vitro T-cell proliferation
BMDC (5x104 cells/well) were cultured for 24 h with spider silk
particles in the absence or presence of R848 (0.25 mg/ml) to induce
BMDC maturation. Splenic OT-I CD8þ T-cells were then negatively
selected using a CD8þ T-cell mouse isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), stained with 5,6-carboxyfluorescein
diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Biolegend, San Diego, USA) ac-
cording to the manufacturer's protocol, and added to BMDC at
105 cells per well for 3 days. Cells were harvested for flow cytom-
etry analysis, and the supernatant was stored at �20 �C for cytokine
quantification. T-cell proliferation was determined using flow
cytometry to assess the percentage of CFSElow cells within the
CD3þCD8þ T-cell population.
2.16. Particle biodistribution
C57BL/6JRj mice were injected s.c. with 500 mg FITC-labeled
C16-catSsub-OVAp in 100 mL PBS in the lower part of the right
flank. After 24 h, lymphoid organs were isolated. The percentage of
FITCþ cells was determined per organ and in defined immune cell
populations
of
the
draining
lymph
nodes:
macrophages
(CD11c�CD11bþ),
CD11blow
dendritic
cells
(CD11blowCD11cþ),
CD11bhigh
dendritic
cells
(CD11bhighCD11cþ)
and
other
cells
(CD11c�CD11b�).
2.17. In vivo T-cell proliferation
106 CFSE-labeled CD8þ OT-I cells were adoptively transferred i.v.
into C57BL/6JRj mice. 18 h later, mice were immunized s.c. in the
right flank with 500 mg spider silk particles with or without R848
(25 mg) as adjuvant in 100 mL PBS. 3 days after immunization,
inguinal draining lymph nodes were isolated for flow cytometry
analysis. Proliferation was determined as above.
2.18. Statistical analysis
Fig. 1 was drawn with Origin 8 (OriginLab Corporation, North-
ampton, USA). Figs. 2e7 were drawn using GraphPad Prism version
6.0g (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). The statistical tests used
are indicated in the figure legends. For cell culture experiments
(Figs. 2e7), error bars indicate the standard error of the mean
(SEM) of independent experiments performed on different days.
Each experiment was performed in duplicate or triplicate. Statis-
tical significance of multiple groups to the control group (untreated
sample) was assessed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's
multiple comparison test. Statistical significance between all
groups was assessed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's
multiple comparison test (Fig. 5).
3. Results and discussion
The aim of this study was the development and formulation of a
novel particulate delivery system to improve the induction of
cytotoxic T-cell responses following peptide vaccination. To design
a particulate peptide vaccine based on spider silk proteins, a MHC I-

 restricted peptide from the model antigen ovalbumin, OVA257-264,
was fused to the C-terminus of a previously engineered spider silk
protein, eADF4(C16) [32], using a cathepsin-cleavable linker. Four
different recombinantly engineered proteins were used in this
study: eADF4(C16) without modification, termed C16, the C16-
ovalbumin peptide hybrid protein without linker (C16-OVAp), the
hybrid protein with a cathepsin B substrate linker (C16-catBsub-
OVAp) and the hybrid protein with a cathepsin S substrate linker
(C16-catSsub-OVAp) (Fig. S1). Particles were prepared as previously
described [33].
3.1. Preparation and characterization of hybrid spider silk-OVA
peptide particles
As a first step, the impact of the OVA peptide addition to the
engineered spider silk protein on the size and zeta potential of the
particles was evaluated. The size of the newly designed C16-OVAp
particles (average 369 nm) and the C16-catBsub-OVAp particles
(386 nm) were comparable to that of C16 particles (363 nm). In
contrast, the C16-catSsub-OVAp particles were significantly larger
(510 nm) (Table S1).
In a small-scale optimization study conditions which give a
more homogenous size range for all particle types were defined.
Because the preparation of spider silk particles is based on salting
out using kosmotropic ions according to the Hofmeister series [42],
the effects of a change of the used salt solution for protein pre-
cipitation were evaluated first. At 2 M buffer strength, the change
from potassium phosphate to ammonium sulfate had negligible
effect on size (data not shown), but a trend towards smaller par-
ticles with increasing ionic strength of the ammonium sulfate so-
lution was observed (Fig. 1A). The effect of both a decreased protein
concentration (0.5 mg/ml instead of 1 mg/ml) and a decreased flow
rate (25 ml/min instead of 50 ml/min) lowered the final particle
size only marginally (data not shown). Zeta potential measure-
ments of the spider silk particles showed slightly more negative
values for the particles prepared with the higher molar ammonium
sulfate solutions (Fig. 1B). Finally, SEM micrographs demonstrated
that particles prepared in solutions with different ionic strengths
were all round with a smooth and unimpaired surface (Fig. 1C).
To study the interactions of the different spider silk particles
with immune cells, the following conditions (4 M ammonium sul-
fate solution, 1 mg/ml protein concentration, flow rate of 50 ml/
min) were selected for the preparation of two endotoxin-free par-
ticle batches (below 0.24 EU/mg protein). All particle types were in
a narrow size range between 241 nm and 325 nm and had a zeta
potential between �22 mV and �29 mV (Table 1). In SEM, roundly
shaped particles were visible without damage or fragments
(Fig. S2). Spider silk particles from both preparation batches were
used interchangeably for all further experiments without affecting
the results. Worth noting is the stability of the particles when

 stored at 2e8 �C in highly purified water. Although formal stability
studies were conducted for up to six months only with particles
without the antigenic peptide [33], C16-OVAp particles both with
and without cleavage site linkers showed excellent stability.
Repetition of immunological assays shown in chapters 3.2 to 3.7
within a time period of 12 months did not change the outcome of
the analyses.
To assess the capability of the two hybrid proteins containing a
cathepsin cleavable linker sequence to serve as substrate, an
enzymatic release test with cathepsin B and cathepsin S was con-
ducted [35,36]. The amount of released peptides containing the
OVA peptide sequence was evaluated by RP-HPLC analysis after
incubation for 96 h at 37 �C (Fig. S3). The recombinant protein
containing the cathepsin B cleavage site was poorly cleaved by
cathepsin B, whereas the peptide containing the cathepsin S
cleavage site was released upon exposure to cathepsin S. Antigen-
presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, display
a high enzymatic activity of cathepsins B and S in the endosome
[43,44], suggesting that the hybrid proteins could be readily
cleaved at the designed substrate site after uptake into the endo-
some by these immune cell populations.
3.2. Spider silk particles are preferentially taken up by dendritic
cells
To investigate whether the spider silk particles were taken up by
dendritic cells, which are essential for the initiation of T-cell-
mediated immune responses, a primary culture of dendritic cells
differentiated from mouse bone marrow (bone marrow-derived
dendritic cells, BMDC) was exposed to FITC-labeled particles or
OVA257-264 peptide. For all particle types tested, more than 90% of
the BMDC were FITC-positive after 24 h exposure, whereas only
25% were positive after exposure to FITC-labeled OVA peptide
(Fig. 2A). The uptake of the particles by BMDC was confirmed by
confocal microscopy. Low magnification pictures showed that most
of the cells were FITC-positive after incubation with FITC-labeled
C16 particles (Fig. 2B left). In addition, a lysosomal staining (Lyso-
Tracker) was used to determine whether particles were localized in
the lysosome of the cells, where cathepsins B and S are active.
Indeed, larger magnification pictures highlight the co-localization
of particles with lysosomes (Fig. 2B right). Similar results were
obtained for all FITC-labeled particle types (Fig. S4).
To determine which immune cell population most efficiently
took up the spider silk particles, we incubated freshly isolated
mouse splenocytes, which contain a variety of different immune
cell types, with FITC-labeled C16 particles (Fig. 2C). Only few T cells
were positive for FITC, whereas over 40% of macrophages and 47%
of dendritic cells were FITC-positive. Assessment of the median
fluorescence intensity (MFI) showed that dendritic cells took up
more particles than macrophages on a per-cell basis (Fig. 2D).
Similar results were obtained for all formulations of the FITC-
labeled particles (Fig. S5). Interestingly, dendritic cells showed a

 better uptake even if they generally show less phagocytic activity
than macrophages. The difference in uptake between cell types
may be explained by the fact that dendritic cells preferentially take
up virus-sized particles (below 500 nm, as was the case for the
spider silk particles) whereas macrophages preferentially take up
larger particles (0.5e5 mm) [45]. Moreover, slightly negative parti-
cles might be taken up by micropinocytosis in dendritic cells [46].
In a study comparing the uptake of PLGA particles with a size
ranging from 300 nm to 17 mm, the 300 nm particles were most
efficiently taken up by dendritic cells and induced the highest T-cell
responses when used as vaccine delivery system [47]. Taken
together, we show that all spider silk particles tested, with a size of
approximately
300 nm
and
a
zeta-potential
of
approximately �25 mV, are efficiently taken up by dendritic cells
and macrophages.
3.3. Spider silk particles do not affect viability of dendritic cells
It is well described that particles can affect the viability of im-
mune cells [48]. To determine whether the uptake of hybrid spider
silk particles by dendritic cells can lead to cell death, BMDC were
exposed for 24 h to a particle concentration 10 times higher than
the concentration used for other in vitro experiments. Cell death
was measured by flow cytometry using annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI) staining to differentiate between apoptotic cells and
dead cells. None of the spider silk particles tested affected the
percentage of live BMDC (annexin V/PI double-negative cells)
(Fig. 3A and B). These results were confirmed by an independent
metabolic
assay,
the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT assay, Fig. 3C). This
method, which reflects the mitochondrial activity of cells, is
frequently used as high-throughput screening assay to determine
toxicity of compounds [49]. No impairment of the metabolic ac-
tivity of BMDC was observed for any of the spider silk particles
tested. Thus, using two independent methods, we demonstrated
that hybrid spider silk particles do not induce apoptotic or necrotic
cell death in BMDC. These results correlate with previous studies
demonstrating the biocompatibility of native spider silk particles
[50].
3.4. Spider silk particles do not induce proinflammatory responses
in dendritic cells
Because unspecific dendritic cell maturation may lead to
generalized inflammatory responses, we investigated whether the
particles were pro-inflammatory in themselves. BMDC were incu-
bated with spider silk particles for 24 h before testing for signs of
dendritic cell maturation, such as the up-regulation of the antigen-
presenting molecules and of the co-stimulatory factors on the cell
surface. Lipopolysaccharide, a Toll-like receptor 4 agonist, was used
as positive control to induce BMDC maturation [51]. None of the
particle types induced a significant up-regulation of antigen-
presenting molecules (MCH I and MHC II) on BMDC (Fig. 4A) nor
increased the density of the co-stimulatory factors (CD80 and
CD86) (data not shown). Once activated, dendritic cells secrete pro-
inflammatory cytokines such as interleukine-6 (IL-6) and tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) in order to recruit and activate other
immune cells. To determine whether spider silk particles induce
the secretion of these pro-inflammatory cytokines, the culture su-
pernatant was collected after 24 h incubation of particles with
Fig. 4. Spider silk particles do not induce proinflammatory responses in dendritic
cells. BMDC were cultured with 50 mg particles/ml (¼ 1 mg/ml OVA peptide) or OVA
peptide alone (OVAp; 1 mg/ml). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml) was used as
positive control. After 24 h, BMDC were analyzed by flow cytometry, and supernatant
was collected for cytokine quantification. (A) Median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of

 BMDC and assessed by ELISA. None of the spider silk particles
induced a significant secretion of these cytokines (Fig. 4B). Thus,
the
hybrid
spider
silk
particles
showed
no
intrinsic
pro-
inflammatory activity and did not lead to unspecific immune acti-
vation in vitro.
3.5. Cathepsin S-cleavable hybrid spider silk particles induce a
strong cytotoxic T-cell proliferation in vitro
To induce an effective cytotoxic T-cell response to the model
antigenic peptide OVA257-264, the OVA peptide must be cleaved
from the spider silk protein and cross-presented by antigen-
presenting cells in an MHC-class I-restricted manner [52,53].
Cross-presentation can further be supported by the activity of
cathepsin S [54]. To determine whether the hybrid spider silk
particles could be processed and the OVA peptide efficiently pre-
sented, a BMDC-induced T-cell proliferation assay using OVA-
specific cytotoxic T cells (OT-I T-cells) [55] was performed. BMDC
were incubated with spider silk hybrid particles as antigen donor
and with resiquimod (R848) as adjuvant to induce BMDC matura-
tion. After 24 h, CFSE-labeled OT-I T cells were added to the culture
and T-cell proliferation was assessed 3 days later by measuring
CFSE dilution, where CFSElow cells represent divided cells. No T-cell
proliferation was induced by BMDC loaded with C16-OVAp parti-
cles (Fig. 5A and B). Little T-cell proliferation was seen after co-
culture with BMDC loaded with C16-catBsub-OVAp particles. In
contrast, BMDC exposed to C16-catSsub-OVAp induced a strong T-
cell proliferation that was much higher than with BMDC exposed to
free OVA peptide. This high proliferation was associated with
higher levels of IFNg secretion (Fig. 5C). Thus, particles prepared
from hybrid proteins with a cathepsin S-cleavable linker induced
the strongest priming of antigen-specific T cells. These particles
were selected for further in vivo investigations in mice.
3.6. Cathepsin S-cleavable hybrid spider silk particles accumulate in
the draining lymph nodes
As the activation of cytotoxic T cells by dendritic cells occurs in
lymph nodes, it is essential that the antigen-bearing particles reach
these organs. To assess whether this was the case, the bio-
distribution
of
FITC-labeled
C16-catSsub-OVAp
particles
was
analyzed following their subcutaneous injection into the flank of
mice. 24 h after injection, the spleen, contralateral non-draining
lymph nodes and ipsilateral draining lymph nodes were isolated
for flow cytometry detection of FITC fluorescence. Spider silk par-
ticles were clearly detected in the draining lymph nodes but not in
non-draining lymph nodes nor in the spleen (Fig. 6A). Importantly,
none of the treated mice showed any sign of toxicity during the
experiment.
Nanoparticles may reach the draining lymph nodes by one of
two mechanisms: they can be borne passively to the lymph nodes
via the lymph and be trapped there by resident macrophages, or be
taken up by dendritic cells at the injection site and actively trans-
ported to the lymph node [56]. Because spider silk particles are
larger than 200 nm, they are expected to be taken up by dendritic
cells at the site of injection [57]. To distinguish between these two
Fig. 6. Cathepsin S-cleavable hybrid spider silk particles accumulate in the

into the right flank of 3 mice. 24 h after injection, the spleen, contralateral non-
draining inguinal lymph nodes (non DLN) and draining ipsilateral inguinal lymph
nodes (DLN) were isolated for flow cytometry analysis. (A) Number of FITCþ cells in

mice were vaccinated with spider silk particles (500 mg per mouse). R848 (25 mg) was
used as adjuvant. 3 days after vaccination, draining lymph nodes were isolated for flow
cytometry analysis to determine the proliferation of CD3þCD8þ CFSE-labeled OT-I cells.

 transport mechanisms, the cell population that was positive for
spider silk particles in the lymph nodes was determined. Neither
macrophages nor CD11blow dendritic cells were found to be
significantly FITC-positive (Fig. 6B). In contrast, CD11bhigh dendritic
cells were clearly positive for FITC, indicating that this cell popu-
lation had taken up FITC-labeled C16-catSsub-OVAp particles. This
data correlated with the in vitro uptake assay demonstrating that
dendritic cells were the main population to take up spider silk
particles (Fig. 6). It is probable that the particles were taken up by
classical dermal dendritic cells, which are CD11bhigh, rather than
CD103þ dendritic cells, which are CD11blow [58]. Importantly,
dermal
dendritic
cells
can prime
cytotoxic
T-cell
responses
[59e61].
3.7. Cathepsin S-cleavable hybrid spider silk particles induce strong
T-cell responses in mice
In order to examine the potential of spider silk-OVA peptide
particles to induce a cytotoxic T-cell response, an in vivo T-cell
proliferation assay was performed. First CFSE-labeled OT-I T-cells
were injected into recipient wild-type mice. One day later, mice
were vaccinated using the cathepsin S-cleavable hybrid particles as
antigen carrier and resiquimod (R848) as adjuvant to induce den-
dritic cell maturation. Three days after vaccination, the draining
lymph nodes of the treated mice were isolated for quantification of
OVAp-specific T-cell proliferation. C16-catSsub-OVAp were highly
efficient in inducing antigen-specific proliferation of cytotoxic T
cells, whereas C16 particles without OVA peptide were not (Fig. 7).
Importantly, T-cell proliferation induced by cathepsin S-cleavable
particles was just as strong in the absence of R848 as adjuvant.
This is of importance, because other carrier systems usually
require co-administration of a direct immunostimulatory adjuvant
such as R848 to induce immune responses. For example, PLGA
particles in the size range between 350 and 410 nm showed much
greater effect when co-administered with an immunostimulatory
adjuvant [62]. Unfortunately, a high burst release of the adjuvant
after administration is commonly observed when PLGA particles
are used [63]. When multilamellar liposomes with a comparable
size to the spider silk-OVA peptide particles were used as delivery
system for protein antigens, they induced more efficient T-cell
proliferation in presence of a direct immunostimulatory adjuvant
[64]. This effect was even greater when the adjuvant was encap-
sulated with the antigen inside the carrier. However, the prepara-
tion of these multilamellar liposomes requires an additional cross-
linking step during preparation, which bears the potential risk of
toxic cross-linking residues in the final product.
4. Conclusions
Cellular immunity is of major importance for protection against
certain infectious diseases and in cancer. Here, we demonstrate the
ability of engineered spider silk particles to function as peptide
vaccine delivery system and to induce cytotoxic T-cell proliferation
in the draining lymph nodes of mice. Importantly, this effect was
seen even in the absence of adjuvant, although the particles alone
were not pro-inflammatory and did not induce unspecific immune
responses. Our results also demonstrate the high stability of the
particles, allowing for storage for over a year and heat sterilization
without losing their immune functionality. Moreover, particles from
two fully independent batches led to comparable in vivo results
demonstrating a robust manufacturing process. Thus, a sound basis
for a protein-based all-in-one vaccination system is set, where spi-
der silk particles serve as particulate vaccine carriers for customized
peptide epitopes. The presented findings can be the basis for future
studies to screen additional linker sequences and moreepitopes. The
following studies should also focus on encapsulation of an adjuvant
within the particles to possibly enhance the effect of the antigen
presentation, allowing for a reduction of antigen per dose.
