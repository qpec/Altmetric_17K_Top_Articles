INTRODUCTION
Loss of normal day/night activity rhythms characterized 
by increased daytime sleep and nighttime wakefulness is a 
common symptom of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD; Witting et 
al., 1990; Satlin et al., 1995; Hatfield et al., 2004). These 
symptoms suggest dysfunctional biological timing in AD, 
indicative of a faulty circadian system. Accordingly, neuro-
pathological changes in the volume and cell number within 
the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central locus of the 
circadian system, are observed in postmortem AD tissue 
and correlate with circadian rhythm degradation (Swaab 
et al., 1985; Zhou et al., 1995; Harper et al., 2008; Wang 
et al., 2015). Although circadian dysfunction has long been 
considered a consequence of AD-related neurodegenera-
tion, it has more recently been hypothesized as a potential 
contributor to the pathogenesis of AD (Maywood et al., 
2006; Hastings and Goedert, 2013; Musiek and Holtzman, 
2016). This idea is strongly supported by epidemiologi-
cal studies showing that a loss of robust circadian activ-
ity rhythms or sleep fragmentation in cognitively normal 
people is associated with increased risk of developing de-
mentia (Tranah et al., 2011; Lim et al., 2013). However, 
it remains unclear whether or how the circadian system 
influences AD pathogenesis.
Amyloid plaques composed of aggregated amyloid-β 
(Aβ) peptides are a defining pathological feature of AD. 
Identifying factors that influence the accumulation of Aβ 
peptide is critical toward enhancing our understanding 
of AD pathogenesis. Normally, soluble Aβ peptide lev-
els exhibit robust daily oscillations in mouse hippocampal 
interstitial fluid (ISF), as measured by in vivo cerebral mi-
crodialysis, as well as in human cerebrospinal fluid (Kang 
et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2012; Roh et al., 2012). These 
oscillations show a clear 24-h period, persist in constant 
dim lighting conditions (Kang et al., 2009), and are in phase 
with known circadian rhythms in activity, suggesting that 
Aβ rhythms in the brain may be controlled by the circa-
dian system. Although it is well established that the circadian 
clock regulates the timing of periods of wakefulness and 
inactivity as well as many other rhythmic processes in the 
brain (Toh et al., 2001; Laposky et al., 2005), the role of the 
circadian system in controlling Aβ dynamics and amyloid 
plaque deposition remains unknown.
The mammalian circadian system is organized hier-
archically, with the central “master” circadian clock in the 
SCN of the hypothalamus synchronizing subsidiary periph-
eral clocks distributed throughout the brain and body to 
coordinate physiology and behavior rhythms within a 24-h 
period (Mohawk et al., 2012). 
The central clock in the SCN 
and peripheral clocks in cells throughout the body use sim-
ilar core molecular components composed of transcrip-
tional–translational feedback loops to drive clock-controlled 
gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. At the molec-
ular level, the positive transcriptional limb composed of 
the transcription factor BMAL1 (also known as aryl hy-
drocarbon nuclear translocator-like [ARN 
TL]) in com-
Nighttime restlessness and daytime drowsiness are common and early symptoms of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). This symptomol-
ogy implicates dysfunctional biological timing, yet the role of the circadian system in AD pathogenesis is unknown. To evaluate 
the role of the circadian clock in amyloid-β (Aβ) dynamics and pathology, we used a mouse model of β-amyloidosis and dis-
rupted circadian clock function either globally or locally in the brain via targeted deletion of the core clock gene Bmal1. Our 
results demonstrate that loss of central circadian rhythms leads to disruption of daily hippocampal interstitial fluid Aβ oscil-
lations and accelerates amyloid plaque accumulation, whereas loss of peripheral Bmal1 in the brain parenchyma increases 
expression of Apoe and promotes fibrillar plaque deposition. These results provide evidence that both central circadian rhythms 
and local clock function influence Aβ dynamics and plaque formation and demonstrate mechanisms by which poor circadian 
hygiene may directly influence AD pathogenesis.

plex with circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLO 
CK) or neuronal PAS-containing protein 2 (NPAS2) drives 
circadian transcription of clock-controlled genes includ-
ing repressor Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes 
that comprise the negative regulatory limb of the circadian 
molecular clock. Deletion of Bmal1 renders the circadian 
molecular clock dysfunctional in any given tissue includ-
ing the SCN, and it prevents clock-mediated transcriptional 
regulation (Bunger et al., 2000). Mice with global Bmal1 
deletion have complete loss of circadian function both in 
terms of SCN-driven central rhythms such as activity and 
temperature as well as cellular transcriptional rhythms across 
tissues. However, targeted deletion of Bmal1 within brain 
regions outside of the SCN disrupts local cellular circadian 
clock function and gene transcription without disturbing 
SCN-driven central rhythms (Mieda and Sakurai, 2011; 
Musiek et al., 2013). Thus, tissue-specific deletion of clock 
function can be used to evaluate the contribution of pe-
ripheral (local) versus central circadian clock function on Aβ 
dynamics in vivo. In this study, we determine whether the 
circadian clock controls Aβ oscillations in the hippocam-
pus and impacts amyloid plaque deposition in vivo by using 
both tissue-specific and global Bmal1 deletion in a mouse 
model of β-amyloidosis. Furthermore, we interrogate the 
relative contributions of the central SCN-driven circadian 
clock and that of the local clocks of the brain to Aβ dynam-
ics and plaque pathology.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Hippocampus-specific Bmal1 deletion does 
not alter ISF Aβ rhythms
Because the circadian clock machinery within the hippo-
campus can regulate local gene expression, we first sought to 
determine whether the local hippocampal circadian clock is 
required for daily oscillations of ISF Aβ by examining the ef-
fect of targeted Bmal1 deletion in the hippocampus in a mouse 
model of β-amyloidosis. We used the APP 
PS1-21 transgenic 
model, which expresses the human amyloid precursor protein 
(APP) gene bearing the KM670/671NL “Swedish” muta-
tions as well as human presenilin 1 bearing an AD-associated 
L166P mutation (Radde et al., 2006). We chose this particu-
lar AD mouse model because these mice exhibit early onset 
of amyloid plaques beginning at 2 mo of age. Using young 
mice (≤4 mo old) eliminates any age-related changes in 
the mouse’s intrinsic circadian system. Also, this AD mouse 
model is one of the few on a pure C57BL/6 background, 
thereby minimizing any strain-dependent effects on circadian 
behaviors. We found that 3–4-mo-old APP 
PS1-21 mice do 
not have any apparent abnormalities in circadian rhythms of 
behavior or basal clock gene expression (Fig. S1), and thus 
all circadian dysfunction observed in subsequent experiments 
was induced by our manipulations of Bmal1 in this system. 
Moreover, we observed close correlation between a classical 
circadian behavior assay involving wheel-running behavior 
and rhythms in core body temperature, allowing us to use 
core body temperature for circadian behavioral rhythms in 
subsequent experiments. T
o achieve localized deletion of 
Bmal1 within the hippocampus, we performed intrahippo-
campal injection of an adenoassociated virus (AAV8) express-
ing either Cre–internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-GFP or a 
GFP control construct in 3-wk-old APP 
PS1-21 mice bear-
ing two floxed Bmal1 alleles (Bmal1f/f;APP 
PS1-21; Storch et 
al., 2007). Because amyloid plaque deposition can influence 
soluble Aβ dynamics (Roh et al., 2012), microdialysis was 
performed before 2 mo of age, which marks the appearance 
of amyloid plaque pathology, in all experiments. At 5 wk of 
age, microdialysis probes were placed directly into the region 
of viral vector injection, ensuring that Bmal1 was deleted in 
the hippocampal tissue directly surrounding the microdialy-
sis probe (Fig. 1, A–D). After a 2-wk recovery from surgery, 
ISF Aβ levels were measured in freely moving mice for ≤4 
d under 12-h:12-h light/dark (L:D) conditions (Kang et al., 
2009). Hippocampus-specific Bmal1 deletion had no effect 
on the hippocampal daily oscillations of ISF Aβ, suggesting 
that the local core circadian clock within the hippocampus is 
not required for daily Aβ oscillations (Fig. 1, E and f).
Bmal1 deletion throughout the brain but with sparing of 
the SCN leaves ISF Aβ rhythms intact
We next sought to more thoroughly distinguish the ef-
fect of peripheral circadian clocks from those of the cen-
tral clock on ISF Aβ oscillations. Because oscillation in Aβ 
levels may depend of peripheral circadian clocks in other 
brain regions that innervate the hippocampus, we exam-
ined whether Bmal1 deletion throughout the entire brain 
but with sparing of the SCN would impact hippocampal 
ISF Aβ rhythms. 
We used Nestin-Cre+;Bmal1(f/f) mice, which 
have Bmal1 deleted in neurons and astrocytes throughout 
the brain but with unperturbed BMAL1 expression in the 
central clock in the SCN (Fig. 2, A and C). Even with loss 
of local circadian transcriptional regulation in the cortex and 
hippocampus, these mice have intact core body tempera-
tures and rest–activity rhythms (Fig. 2, B and D; Musiek et 
al., 2013). However, we have previously shown that these 
mice have loss of circadian clock gene transcription in the 
cerebral cortex and develop astrogliosis because of the loss 
of local Bmal1, effects which are independent of the cen-
tral clock (Fig. S2 A; Musiek et al., 2013). We examined the 
effects of brain-specific clock disruption but with intact 
SCN-mediated rhythms on hippocampal ISF Aβ rhythms by 
generating Nestin-Cre+;Bmal1f/f);APP 
PS1-21 mice (referred 
to as Nes-Bmal1 KO;APP). We observed that daily oscilla-
tions in hippocampal ISF Aβ in Nes-Bmal1 KO;APP mice 
were similar to those seen in Cre−;APP littermate controls, 
though the small peak in Aβ levels observed immediately 
after lights off was slightly blunted (Fig. 2, E and F). These 
results again show minimal involvement of extra-SCN local 
cellular clocks of the brain in ISF Aβ rhythms and suggest 
that these rhythms are mediated by the central clock in the 
SCN and transmitted to the hippocampus.

Local Bmal1 deletion in the brain with sparing 
of the SCN modestly increases fibrillar but not 
total amyloid plaque burden
We next used Nes-Bmal1 KO;APP mice to examine the ef-
fect of brain-specific clock disruption but with sparing of the 
SCN on amyloid plaque pathology. At 4 mo of age, Cre−, 
Bmal1(f/f);APP 
PS1-21 (Cre−;APP) mice accumulate mild am-
yloid plaque pathology in the hippocampus similar to that 
observed in standard APP 
PS1-21 mice. Nes-Bmal1 KO;APP 
littermate mice showed no increase in total amyloid plaque 
burden within the hippocampus compared with Cre−;APP 
littermates as assessed by Aβ1–13 antibody staining (HJ3.4 an-
tibody; Fig. 2, G and H). However, there was a modest but 
clear trend toward an increase specifically in fibrillar amyloid 
plaque burden, quantified by staining with the congophilic 
dye X34, in the hippocampus of Nes-Bmal1 KO;APP mice 
(P = 0.06 by two-tailed t test, and P = 0.03 by one-tailed t 
test). Thus, mice with deletion of Bmal1 throughout the ex-
tra-SCN brain but with intact central circadian rhythms had 
relatively normal hippocampal ISF Aβ oscillations, and they 
showed no change in total plaque levels but did show a small 
increase in hippocampal fibrillar plaque burden. Collectively, 
these data indicate that local peripheral clocks do not strongly 
influence Aβ oscillations or overall plaque deposition in the 
hippocampus but that local Bmal1 deletion may promote the 
formation of fibrillar Aβ plaques.
Global Bmal1 deletion causes loss of ISF Aβ rhythms in the 
hippocampus and markedly increases amyloid plaque burden
Finally, we examined the effect of whole-organism circadian 
disruption, including the SCN, on hippocampal ISF Aβ dy-
namics and plaque deposition. We were unable to cross APP 
PS1-21 mice to standard global Bmal1 KO mice because of 
poor viability. However, we were able to measure endogenous 
murine ISF Aβ (as opposed to human Aβ in the APP 
PS1-21 
models) by microdialysis in standard Bmal1 KO mice, which 
have global Bmal1 deletion and have dysfunctional central and 
peripheral clocks as well as fragmented activity and core body 
temperature circadian rhythms (Fig. 3, A and B; Bunger et al., 
2000). These experiments allowed us to evaluate the effect of 
global Bmal1 deletion on ISF Aβ dynamics, but because there 
is no human APP 
PS1 transgene, the levels of murine Aβ were

lower, and samples had to be pooled to detect Aβ, decreasing 
the sampling frequency. Despite these obstacles, we found that 
arrhythmic Bmal1 KO mice had severely diminished daily os-
cillations in hippocampal ISF Aβ, even under 12-h:12-h L:D 
conditions, as compared with WT littermates (Fig. 3 C). Aβ 
oscillation amplitude was significantly decreased by 50% in 
global Bmal1 KO mice (Fig. 3 D). However, integrated levels 
of ISF Aβ over the 24-h circadian cycle were similar to WT 
littermate controls (Fig. 3 E), demonstrating that although 
Bmal1 deletion disrupts the day/night rhythms of Aβ (leading 
to higher levels during the light period and lower levels during 
the dark), it does not cause gross increases in Aβ levels. Thus, 
loss of central and peripheral rhythms caused by global Bmal1 
deletion abrogates rhythmicity of ISF Aβ in the hippocampus.
Because standard global Bmal1 KO;APP 
PS1-21 mice 
were not viable in our hands and because mice do not 
develop amyloid plaques without a human APP transgene, 
we chose to examine the effects of global Bmal1 deletion 
on amyloid plaque deposition using a tamoxifen-inducible 
global Bmal1 KO mouse (CAG-CreERT2;Bmal1f/f, abbreviated 
as Bmal1 iKO), which could be bred onto an APP 
PS1-21 
background. Bmal1 iKO mice were previously characterized 
and phenocopy standard Bmal1 KO mice as they become 
transcriptionally arrhythmic after tamoxifen treatment and 
develop astrogliosis (Yang et al., 2016). Indeed, tamoxifen 
treatment of Bmal1 iKO mice at 8 wk of age resulted in a 
nearly complete deletion of BMAL1 throughout the brain, 
including the SCN (Fig. 4, A and C), and led to a loss of 
circadian core body temperature rhythms (Fig. 4, B and D). 
However, postnatal deletion of Bmal1 in these mice avoids 
the developmental pathologies and early mortality observed 
in standard Bmal1 KO mice (Yang et al., 2016). We generated 
CAG-CreERT2;Bmal1f/f;APP 
PS1-21 mice (abbreviated as 
Bmal1 iKO;APP) to evaluate the effect of circadian disruption

on amyloid plaque deposition. Notably, Bmal1 iKO;APP mice 
were not amenable to ISF Aβ measurement as the tamoxifen 
regimen was toxic to mice <6 wk old and treatment after 
that age did not allow sufficient time to allow for surgery, 
recovery, and microdialysis before plaque accumulation had 
begun at 2 mo of age. We treated cohorts of Bmal1 iKO;APP 
mice and their Cre− littermate controls (Bmal1f/f;APP 
PS1-21 
mice; both sexes) with tamoxifen for 5 d starting at 8 wk of 
age and collected tissues at 4 mo of age. Bmal1 iKO 
:APP 
mice accumulated significantly more hippocampal amyloid 
plaque burden, quantified either by Aβ antibody to assess 
total plaque load or by staining with the congophilic dye 
X34 to assess fibrillar plaque pathology (Fig. 4, E and F). 
Thus, global disruption of circadian function by postnatal 
global Bmal1 deletion increases amyloid plaque deposition 
in the hippocampus. Collectively, our results show that global 
Bmal1 deletion abolishes behavior rhythms mediated by the 
central clock, disrupts local clock-mediated transcription, 
abrogates ISF Aβ rhythms, and increases amyloid plaque 
deposition in the hippocampus.
Bmal1 regulates local apolipoprotein E (Apoe) 
expression in the brain
T
o explore possible transcriptional mechanisms by which 
the circadian system regulates Aβ plaque deposition, we 
performed transcriptional analysis of a panel of genes with 
known functions related to Aβ production, clearance, or ag-
gregation in cortex tissue from Nes-Bmal1 KO (which have 
intact central rhythms but local Bmal1 deletion) and Bmal1 
iKO mice (which have disrupted central rhythms and local 
Bmal1 deletion) as well as Cre− controls. Expression of several 
Aβ-related genes were altered, and these changes were gener-
ally consistent between the two models, suggesting local tran-
scriptional regulation by Bmal1 (Fig. S2 A). Among these, we 
observed significantly increased expression of Apoe in both 
mouse models, demonstrating that Apoe is regulated by local 
BMAL1 independent of the central clock. 
We examined Apoe 
expression in cortex tissue from Cre− controls and Nes-Bmal1 
KO mice across the circadian cycle. Apoe mRNA showed 
only a modest time-of-day variation in control mice and 
was increased at all time points in Nes-Bmal1 KO mice (Fig. 
S2 B). The human APOE genotype is major determinant of 
AD risk, and murine Apoe has been shown to potently pro-
mote amyloid plaque deposition, specifically fibrillar amyloid 
plaques (Holtzman et al., 2000; Fagan et al., 2002; DeMattos 
et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2011). Thus, local Bmal1 deletion in 
the brain induces Apoe expression, providing one potential 
mechanism by which local Bmal1 deletion promotes fibril-
lar plaque formation. However, multiple BMAL1-controlled 
pathways may also contribute to this effect.
Our data demonstrate that the circadian system influ-
ences daily oscillations in hippocampal ISF Aβ and that dis-
ruption of circadian function promotes hippocampal amyloid 
plaque deposition in vivo. ISF Aβ oscillations do not require 
local cellular clock function in the hippocampus itself nor in 
other non-SCN brain regions but instead appear to depend 
on the central circadian clock within the SCN. Loss of local 
BMAL1 expression in the hippocampus with sparing of cen-
tral rhythms in Nes-Bmal1KO; APP mice had minimal im-
pact on overall amyloid plaque deposition, but it did promote 
fibrillar plaque accumulation, perhaps at least in part through 
direct regulation of Apoe. Global Bmal1-iKO;APP mice,

which have an arrhythmic central clock and local Bmal1 
deletion, develop much more striking increases in plaque 
burden than Nes-Bmal1KO; APP mice, which have normal 
central rhythms but local Bmal1 deletion, showing that the 
increases in amyloid pathology cannot be fully explained 
by noncircadian effects of Bmal1 deletion and are likely 
caused by a combination of dysregulated SCN-mediated 
circadian control of Aβ oscillations and local alterations in 
BMAL1-mediated transcription. In total, our study suggests 
that the circadian system is critical for maintaining proper Aβ 
oscillations and Aβ homeostasis in the hippocampus and that 
circadian dysfunction may disrupt the normal temporal syn-
chrony or feedback inhibition between Aβ production and 
systems involved in Aβ clearance and/or aggregation. As cir-
cadian rhythm dysfunction appears to precede cognitive im-
pairment in AD (Tranah et al., 2011; Musiek et al., 2018), our 
findings highlight novel mechanisms linking early circadian 
dysfunction to accelerated amyloid plaque accumulation and 
provide evidence for an important influence of the circadian 
system on AD pathogenesis.
Fragmented circadian rhythms can be detected in nor-
mal aging as well as in preclinical AD (Musiek et al., 2018) and 
become more apparent in early symptomatic AD (Hatfield et 
al., 2004; Harper et al., 2005). Degeneration of the SCN has 
been described in 
AD and linked to circadian rhythm degrada-
tion (Swaab et al., 1985; Zhou et al., 1995; Harper et al., 2008; 
Wang et al., 2015). Altered Bmal1 expression or function has 
also been specifically associated with AD. Altered methylation 
of Bmal1 in AD has been proposed as a possible cause of cir-
cadian dysfunction (Cronin et al., 2017), whereas Aβ can re-
portedly induce BMAL1 degradation in an AD mouse model 
(Song et al., 2015). Finally, polymorphisms in Bmal1 are asso-
ciated with increased AD risk in ApoE4-negative individuals 
(Chen et al., 2015). Thus, there is a strong biological rationale 
for modeling AD-related circadian dysfunction by disrupting 
Bmal1. However, Bmal1 regulates expression of transcripts 
which are nonrhythmic, suggesting that it serves noncirca-
dian functions (Yu and Weaver, 2011; Yang et al., 2016). We 
have previously demonstrated that Bmal1 deletion can in-
duce glial activation and oxidative damage in Nes-Bmal1 KO 
mice, which have normal circadian rhythms and sleep timing, 
demonstrating that Bmal1 can exert critical local effects in 
the brain (Musiek et al., 2013). However, in this study, we 
did not see significant effects of local Bmal1 deletion on ISF 
Aβ dynamics or total plaque deposition, demonstrating that 
the effects of global Bmal1 deletion on hippocampal ISF Aβ 
and plaque burden are at least in part a result of disrupted 
central rhythms. Increased Apoe expression was observed in 
both Nes-Bmal1 KO and Bmal1 iKO mice, suggesting that 
loss of Bmal1 induces local Apoe expression independent of 
an effect on rhythms or sleep. It has been well established that 
APOE specifically promotes fibrillar amyloid plaque depo-
sition, as APP transgenic mice lacking Apoe have striking 
decreases in fibrillar plaque burden (Holtzman et al., 2000; 
Fagan et al., 2002; DeMattos et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2011).

Thus, the local tissue effect of Bmal1 deletion on Apoe lev-
els could potentially explain the specific increase in fibril-
lar plaques in Nes-Bmal1 KO;APP mice. However, our data 
suggest that the combination of central clock dysfunction, 
which disrupts ISF Aβ rhythms, and local Bmal1 deletion, 
which increases local Apoe expression and may alter other 
pathways, leads to a striking increase in plaques observed in 
Bmal1 iKO;APP mice (see Fig. 4).
It is well established that sleep exerts a powerful influ-
ence on Aβ plaque pathology as sleep deprivation accelerates 
plaque deposition, whereas increasing sleep through inhibi-
tion of orexin signaling mitigates plaque accumulation (Kang 
et al., 2009; Roh et al., 2014). The central circadian clock of 
the SCN regulates the timing of sleep and thus could affect 
amyloid plaque deposition through a sleep-dependent mech-
anism. Our data show that this may be the case as Bmal1 
iKO mice, which have fragmented sleep rhythms, have a 
greater increase in plaques than SCN-sparing brain-specific 
Nes-Bmal1 KO mice, which have normal sleep timing. How-
ever, this is not caused by sleep deprivation as global Bmal1 
KO mice are known to have slightly increased total and 
slow-wave sleep (Laposky et al., 2005). Bmal1 KO mice do 
have arrhythmic sleep timing with loss of variation in sleep 
between the light and dark periods (Laposky et al., 2005), a 
pattern which resembles the sleep and wake fragmentation 
observed in AD patients, who often wake throughout the 
night and nap throughout the day (Witting et al., 1990; Satlin 
et al., 1995; Hatfield et al., 2004). This circadian fragmen-
tation appears before symptom onset in AD (Tranah et al., 
2011; Musiek et al., 2018), suggesting that it could exacer-
bate amyloid deposition in an early phase of AD pathogenesis. 
A clear implication of our findings is that therapies directly 
targeting the circadian system to normalize circadian timing, 
rather than just augmenting total sleep, may be beneficial 
in the prevention of AD.
Our study has some limitations. Our microdialysis ex-
periments were performed in standard 12-h:12-h L:D condi-
tions rather than constant darkness. Because Bmal1 iKO;APP 
mice developed increased plaques in L:D conditions, we con-
cluded that it was critical to demonstrate that ISF Aβ oscilla-
tions were also disturbed in L:D, which is what we observed. 
Moreover, Bmal1 deletion causes arrhythmicity even in L:D 
conditions, making repetition of these experiments in con-
stant darkness less critical. Direct lesioning of the SCN in 
APP 
PS1-21 mice to disrupt central rhythms without deleting 
local clock genes would provide complementary data to our 
study, though such experiments are fraught with difficulty 
as the SCN is small and surrounded by other hypothalamic 
nuclei, which can potentially also impact amyloid plaque 
development if accidently damaged. These studies could be 
pursued in the future. Monitoring of sleep by electroen-
cephalography was not performed, though electroencepha-
lography analysis of sleep has previously been performed in 
standard Bmal1 KO and Nes-Bmal1 KO mice and was found 
to be arrhythmic in the former and normal in the latter and 
correlated closely with actigraphy and body temperature 
rhythms in both models.
In summary, our data reveal the importance of circadian 
timing in the regulation of amyloid pathology. The circadian 
system orchestrates the synchrony between many physiolog-
ical processes with the external environment and regulates 
gene transcription in various cell types throughout the brain. 
Our findings demonstrate a potential mechanistic link be-
tween circadian dysfunction and AD pathogenesis, suggesting 
that therapeutic efforts to optimize circadian timing may hold 
promise for AD prevention.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Reagents and animals
The following antibodies were used: BMAL1 rabbit poly-
clonal (1:2,000; 2288; Novus Biologicals) and a monoclonal 
Aβ1–13 (1:1,000; HJ3.4) made in-house (Kang et al., 2009). 
Various salts and BSA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 
Mice with germline deletion of Bmal1 (Bmal1−/−), Nestin- 
Cre+ (stock 03771), CAGERT2-Cre+ (stock 004453), and 
Bmal1f/f (stock 07668) mice were purchased from The Jackson 
Laboratory. APP 
PS1-21 mice were obtained from M. Jucker 
(University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany). Bmal1f/f or 
Bmal1f/f:APP 
PS1-21 mice were crossed with either tamoxi-
fen-inducible universal (CAG-CreERT2) mice or with Nes-
tin-Cre+/− mice to yield Bmal1f/f mice without Cre, Bmal1f/f: 
CAG-CreERT2+/− mice, and Bmal1f/f;Nestin-Cre+/− mice with 
or without a single copy of the APP 
PS1–21 transgene. All mice 
were maintained on a C57Bl6 background. Both genders were 
used in all experiments. Mice were bred and housed in accor-
dance with Washington University Animal Studies committee 
protocols. Mice were bred and group housed (unless otherwise 
stated) under 12-h:12-h L:D conditions with ad libitum access 
to food and water. 
Tamoxifen stock solution (25 mg/ml; 
T5648; 
Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared as previously described (Yang et 
al., 2012) and administered to 2-mo-old Bmal1f/f;CreERT2-;APP 
PS1-21 mice seven times over 5 consecutive days at 100 µl per 
dose by oral gavage. The efficacy of Bmal1 excision 2 mo after 
the tamoxifen regimen was assessed by the levels of quanti-
tative PCR (qPCR) transcripts and BMAL1 immunostaining 
within the hippocampus. Mice with a reduction of at least 75% 
BMAL1 immunoreactivity within the hippocampus or an at 
least 50% reduction in mRNA of Dbp, a BMAL1-controlled 
gene, met the criteria for further analysis. For circadian gene 
expression experiments, mice were housed in constant dark-
ness for 24 h before and throughout harvest and were anesthe-
tized in darkness before perfusion. Mice were perfused at 4-h 
intervals starting at 6:00 AM and ending 24 h later.
Stereotaxic injections
Stereotaxic guided surgeries were performed on isoflu-
rane-anesthetized mice as previously described (Kress et al., 
2013). In brief, AAV8 vectors expressing Cre-IRES-GFP or 
just GFP under the chicken β-actin promoter (AAV8-CBA-
Cre-IRES-GFP or AAV8-CBA-GFP) were prepared by the 
 Regulation of amyloid-β by the circadian clock | Kress et al.

Washington University 
Viral 
Vector Hope Center Core and in-
jected unilaterally into the hippocampus of 3-wk-old Bmal1f/f: 
APP 
PS1-21 mice (2 µl at 1e13 titer level). Successful targeting 
produced fluorescence primarily in the hippocampus and focal 
Bmal1 excision within the hippocampus and was confirmed 
by the lack of BMAL1 immunoreactive hippocampal tissue at 
the termination of the experiment. Mice recovered for 3 wk 
before undergoing microdialysis cannula implantation.
Microdialysis
Hippocampal in vivo Aβ microdialysis was performed as 
previously described (Kang et al., 2009; Roh et al., 2012). At 
∼6 wk of age, AAV-injected Bmal1f/f:APP 
PS1-21, Bmal1f/f: 
Nestin-Cre+/−:APP 
PS1-21, or germline Bmal1 KO mice 
(∼2–3 mo old) were implanted with a guide cannula for 
microdialysis in the left hippocampus (bregma, 3.1 mm, 2.5 
mm lateral to midline, and 1.2 mm below the dura at a 12° 
angle) and recovered in their home cage for ∼2 wk. On the 
day microdialysis began, mice were tethered to a Basi Raturn 
System, and a microdialysis probe (2 mm; 38-kD molecular 
weight cutoff; BR style; BioAnalytical Systems) was inserted 
into the left hippocampus through the guide cannula and 
connected to a syringe pump (Stoelting). 
Artificial cerebrospinal 
fluid, pH 7.35, containing 1.3 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 
3 mM KCl, 0.4 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 122 mM 
NaCl, and 0.15% BSA was continuously perfused through the 
microdialysis probe at a constant flow rate of 1 µl/min (for the 
detection of murine Aβ, the flow rate was adjusted to 0.5 µl/
min). After 3 d of habituation, hourly microdialysis samples 
were collected over 2–4 d (Cirrito et al., 2003; Kang et al., 
2009). The mean daily ISF Aβ level was calculated over 2–3 
d for each mouse. The rhythm amplitude of the daily ISF Aβ 
oscillation was determined using the circadian cosinor method 
(circadian 
.org 
/softwar 
.html). Data from probe placements 
outside of the hippocampal region or from mice that did not 
eat, drink, or move normally were discarded.
Circadian temperature rhythm
Thermochron iButtons (DS1921H) were used to continually 
record core body temperature rhythms every 15 min as pre-
viously described (Pilz et al., 2015). In brief, in anesthetized 
mice, a longitudinal abdominal incision was made, and the 
iButton was positioned within the intraperitoneal cavity. In-
cisions were closed with absorbable and nylon sutures. Mice 
were house individually in 12-h:12-h L:D conditions for 3–4 
wk and then for 2–7 d in constant dark (DD) conditions 
before the retrieval of the iButton. T
emperature values were 
imported into ClockLab Analysis (6.0.35; Actimetrics) to cre-
ate actograms and L:D periodograms (χ2 method).
ELI 
SA
Microdialysis samples were analyzed for Aβx-40 with a sand-
wich ELI 
SA (Roh et al., 2012). In brief, a monoclonal Aβ 
antibody targeted against amino acids 35–40 (HJ2) was used 
to capture Aβx-40 peptide. A biotinylated central domain 
monoclonal antibody was then applied (HJ5.1). Assays were 
developed using Super Slow ELI 
SA TMB after an incuba-
tion with streptavidin–poly-HRP40 (Fitzgerald). A Bio-T
ek 
Synergy 2 plate reader was used to read the optical density at 
650 nm. Samples were run in replicate, and replicates with a 
coefficient of variation >15% were discarded.
qPCR
For RNA isolation, frozen cortical tissue was homogenized 
in TRIzol (Invitrogen). Chloroform (1:5) was added, samples 
were agitated and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 15 min at 4°C, 
and then the chloroform layer was removed, diluted 1:1 in 
70% ethanol, and purified using RNA purification columns 
and reagents (PureLink; Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was 
converted to complementary DNA via reverse transcription 
using the High-Capacity cDNA-RT kit (MultiScribe; Ap-
plied Biosystems) with 1 µg RNA per 20 µl reaction. Quan-
titative real-time PCR was then performed using proprietary 
TaqMan primers and reagents and an ABI StepOne qPCR 
machine (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All mRNA levels were 
normalized to β-actin (Actb) mRNA levels.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunostaining was performed as previously described (Roh 
et al., 2012). In brief, mice were deeply anesthetized via i.p. 
pentobarbital followed by transcardial perfusion with ice-cold 
PBS containing 3,000 U/liter heparin for 3 min. The whole 
brain or only one hemisphere was fixed in 4% paraformalde-
hyde for 24 h (4°C) and then cryoprotected with 30% sucrose 
in PBS (4°C) for 48 h, and 50-µm serial coronal sections were 
cut on a freezing sliding microtome. For antibody staining, sec-
tions were incubated in PBS for 30 min at RT before blocking 
for 30 min in PBS containing 3% goat serum, 2% BSA, and 
0.25% 
Triton X-100, and then they were incubated overnight 
in PBS plus 0.10% Triton X-100 with primary antibody and 
1% goat serum at 4°C. Sections were then washed with PBS 
containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min followed by a 1-h 
RT incubation with fluorophore-conjugated secondary an-
tibody (Alexa Fluor 488– or 568–conjugated anti–rabbit or 
anti–mouse) and then washed. Nuclei were visualized with 
DAPI (Invitrogen) in PBS for 30 min at RT, and then sections 
were washed for 15 min in PBS and mounted on a coverslip 
using either Fluoromount (Sigma-Aldrich) or ProLong Gold 
Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen). For X34 staining, sections 
were washed in PBS plus 0.10% 
Triton X-100 for 30 min and 
then incubated in staining media containing 60% PBS (vol/
vol), 40% ethanol, 1:500 volume of 10 N NaOH, and 10 µM 
X34 for 20 min at RT. Sections were then washed for three 
time for 2 min each in 60% PBS (vol/vol) and 40% ethanol 
solution and then washed twice for 5 min each in PBS plus 
0.10% Triton X-100. HJ3.4-stained sections were incubated 
with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling T
ech-
nologies) and then with streptavin-conjugated horseradish 
peroxidase (ABC kit; Vector Labs), and then were visualized 
with diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were then

imaged with either an Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon) with 
an Orca-Flash camera (4.0; Hamamatsu Photonics) using a 
MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) system or an A1Rs1 confo-
cal system (Nikon; 
Washington University Center for Cellular 
Imaging). Images were adjusted in ImageJ (National Insti-
tutes of Health) or Photoshop (Adobe) for brightness, con-
trast, and pseudocoloring.
Plaque burden quantification
For plaque burden quantification, serial coronal sections (50 
µm thick) were collected from the corpus callosum to cau-
dal hippocampus. Approximately 3–4 sections (each separated 
by 300 µm) were stained with biotinylated HJ3.4 antibody 
to visualize Aβ-immunoreactive plaques or X34 dye to vi-
sualize fibrillar amyloid plaques. Sections were then imaged 
with either an Eclipse 80i microscope with an Orca-Flash 4.0 
using the MetaMorph system or an Axioscan Z1 automated 
slide scanning system (ZEI 
SS; Washington University Cen-
ter for Cellular Imaging). Using a neurostereological method 
as described previously (Kang et al., 2009), the percent area 
covered within the hippocampus by HJ3.4 or X34-positive 
staining was calculated using ImageJ software. Sections from 
a full set of mice for a given experiment were stained to-
gether as a batch, and imaging parameters were held con-
stant across all sections.
Data analysis and statistics
Graphical illustrations were constructed with Prism (7.0; 
GraphPad Software). Pilot studies to determine the variability 
of outcome measures and the effective size were used to es-
timate the number of observations necessary to test the null 
hypothesis. All graphical representations display the mean of 
the observations in a group with bar graphs and the error 
bars depicting SEM. Distribution-free statistical analyses were 
performed in Prism using the nonparametric Mann–Whit-
ney rank comparison. The cutoff for significance was *, P < 
0.05. The rhythm amplitude of the daily ISF Aβ oscillation 
was determined using the circadian cosinor method (Cosinor 
Software). A cosine transformation was applied to the time 
variable with 24 h circadian cycle for the daily temperature 
and ISF Aβ oscillation (nonlinear regression equation: y = 
baseline + amplitude * cos((frequency * x) + phase shift)) in 
Prism (Huang et al., 2012).
