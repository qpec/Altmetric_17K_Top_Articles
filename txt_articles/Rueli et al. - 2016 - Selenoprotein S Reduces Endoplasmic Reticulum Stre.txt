Abstract
Previous studies demonstrated that selenium in the form of sodium selenate reduces neurofibrillary 
tangle formation in Alzheimer’s disease models. Hyperphosphorylation of tau, which leads to 
formation of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease, is increased by endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) stress. Selenoprotein S (SelS) is part of an ER membrane complex that removes misfolded 
proteins from the ER as a means to reduce ER stress. Selenate, as with other forms of selenium, 
will increase selenoprotein expression. We therefore proposed that increased SelS expression by 
selenate would contribute to the beneficial actions of selenate in Alzheimer’s disease. SelS 
expression increased with ER stress and decreased under conditions of elevated glucose 
concentrations in the SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line. Reducing expression of SelS with siRNA 
promoted cell death in response to ER stress. Selenate increased SelS expression, which 
significantly correlated with decreased tau phosphorylation. Restricting SelS expression during ER 
stress conditions increased tau phosphorylation, and also promoted aggregation of phosphorylated 
tau in neurites and soma. In human postmortem brain, SelS expression coincided with 
neurofibrillary tangles, but not with amyloid-β plaques. These results indicate that selenate can 
alter phosphorylation of tau by increasing expression of SelS in Alzheimer’s disease and 
potentially other neurodegenerative disorders.

INTRODUCTION
According to recent reports, selenium in the form of sodium selenate reduces neurofibrillary 
tangle formation [1, 2]. The studies suggest selenate acts as an agonist for protein 
phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which targets tau phosphorylation. However, selenate 
supplementation also upregulates expression of selenoproteins [3–5]. These proteins contain 
selenocysteine (Sec), the 21st amino acid [6]. Selenate is reduced and converted to 
selenophosphate, and utilized for Sec synthesis directly on the Sec tRNA [7]. Selenoproteins 
have important roles in oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways that could 
potentially influence tau hyperphosphorylation [8, 9]. Selenium deficiency is associated with 
developmental and neurological disorders [9], highlighting the crucial antioxidant functions 
of selenium.
Selenoprotein S is a glucose-regulated ER-bound selenoprotein involved in inflammation 
and removal of misfolded proteins from the ER [8]. SelS is also regulated by inflammatory 
cytokines, and by ischemic conditions in brain astrocytes [10, 11]. Genetic analysis 
demonstrated that a promoter single-nucleotide polymorphism that decreases SelS 
expression in humans is correlated with higher serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, 
suggesting an important role for SelS in regulating inflammation [12]. SelS resides in the ER 
and links derlin-1, a shuttle protein that removes misfolded proteins from the ER to be 
ubiquitinated and transported by the p97 ATPase for proteasomal degradation [13]. Thus, 
impairment of SelS may play a role in disorders involving misfolded proteins, which include 
Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.
In this study, we examine the function of SelS in ER stress in neuronal cells, its regulation 
by selenate and role in tau phosphorylation, and expression in postmortem human 
Alzheimer’s disease brain. We report that SelS is associated with neurofibrillary tangles and 
regulates phosphorylation of tau in response to ER stress.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SH-SY5Y culture conditions
SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. For experiments, cells were 
plated in multiwell plates and differentiated by exposure to Neurobasal media (Invitrogen) 
supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) for 48 h. For selenate treatment, cells were grown in 
Roth-Schweitzer media [14] with 0, 0.1, 1.0, or 10 μM sodium selenate in place of sodium 
selenite.

 ER stress
Cells were differentiated for 48 h in Neurobasal-A media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 
B27 (Invitrogen), and then treated for 20 h with thapsigargin (1 μM), brefeldin A (1 μM), or 
tunicamycin (100 nM). Thapsigargin induces stress by depleting the ER calcium stores [15]. 
Brefeldin A prevents anterograde transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi [16]. 
Tunicamycin prevents the N-glycosylation of glycoproteins necessary for their transport out 
of the ER, inducing the misfolded protein response [17]. These organic compounds were 
solubilized in DMSO to make 10,000X stock concentrations. DMSO (0.01%) was used as a 
vehicle control for studies with these compounds. Following chemical induction of ER 
stress, cells were stained or harvested for mRNA or protein as described below.
Variation of glucose in culture media
SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in low (5 mM) glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS 
(Invitrogen). Cells were then plated onto 35 mM dishes, and media was changed after 1 day 
to glucose-free Neurobasal-A media supplemented with varying levels of glucose (5 mM, 25 
mM, or 50 mM). Mannitol was added at 45 mM, 20 mM, or 0 mM to maintain the same 
osmolarity at all glucose concentrations.
SelS siRNA
SH-SY5Y cells grown in DMEM with 5% FBS were transfected with SelS (5′-
ACGGAAAUCGGACAGAAAGUU-3′) or negative control siRNA (Thermo Scientific) by 
introducing with Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies) for 4 h. 
Media was then changed to Neurobasal media with B27 supplement, followed by an 
additional transfection after a 48-h differentiation. ER stress was induced 4 h after the 
second transfection. After 24 h, cell viability was assayed with an MTS assay kit (Promega) 
according to manufacturer’s instructions, or cells were harvested for protein or mRNA 
studies.
Stable transfection with P301L tau
SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with a pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) containing a Tau 
clone with the P301L mutation [18] using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) per manufacturer’s 
instructions. DMEM with 10% FBS was supplemented with G418 (1 mg/ml) to select for 
transfected cells. Selected cells were then plated at low density on 96 well plates, and wells 
containing single cells identified. Following proliferation, colonies were removed with 
trypsin and replated in selection media. Cells expressing mutant Tau were maintained in 
media with 0.2 mg/ml G418 until changing to differentiation media (Neurobasal 
supplemented with B27 as described above) during experiments.
Western blot
Lysates were prepared from SH-SY5Y cells by sonication in RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling 
Technology) with addition of 1 mM PMSF, as per manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins in 
the lysates were separated via SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane by 
electroblotting. The PVDF membranes were blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (Licor 
Biosciences) for 1 h and incubated with either a rabbit polyclonal SelS antibody (1 : 1000,

tau antibodies for residues T212, S214, T236 (AT180 clone), and S262 (1 : 1000, 
Invitrogen). Co-incubation with a mouse monoclonal alpha-tubulin antibody (Novus 
Biologicals) was used to confirm even loading of protein. We used secondary antibodies 
conjugated with HRP, followed by visualization using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit 
(GE Biosciences), or secondary antibodies labeled with infrared fluorophores, followed by 
imaging with the Odyssey infrared system (Li-Cor Biosciences).

Immunofluorescence
Cells plated onto coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 30 min 
and kept in PBS at 4°C until ready for staining. Cells were blocked with Chemiblocker 
(Millipore) diluted 1 : 2 in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Harleco) for 1 h. After washes 
with PBS and PBST, the cells were incubated in primary antibodies (anti-phospho-tau for 
residue 214, and mouse anti-tau) diluted 1 : 100 in Chemiblocker/PBST with 1% bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies conjugated with 
Alexa 488 and Alexa 546 were diluted 1 : 250 and left on the cells for 30 min at room 
temperature. Following subsequent washes, the coverslips were mounted onto slides using 
Vectashield containing DAPI to label nuclei (Vector Laboratories).

 subjects was published previously [19]. 10 μm sections of medial temporal cortex were 
deparaffinized, and ‘antigen unmasking’ was achieved by heating to 95°C at 15 psi in a 
pressure cooker in an alkaline/EDTA solution (Trilogy, Cell Marque), followed by 3 min in 
90% formic acid. The tissue was blocked in PBS with 5% serum species-matched to 
secondary antibody, followed by avidin and biotin blocking steps. The tissue was then 
incubated at 4◦C overnight with an anti-SelS rabbit polyclonal antibody (1 : 100, Sigma) in 
2.5% serum. After several washes, the tissue was incubated with a biotinylated anti-rabbit 
secondary antibody and ABC™ reagent (Vector Laboratories). HRP signals were developed 
with 3,3-diaminobenzidine hydrochloride (DAB, Vector Labs) and alkaline phosphatase 
detected with BCIP reactions. For double labeling with either tau or amyloid-β, tissues were 
then blocked in 5% normal horse serum, avidin, and biotin solutions and incubated overnight 
at 4°C with anti-amyloid-β 1–16 mouse monoclonal antibody (Chemicon).
Microscopy
Bright-field images of human brain tissue were obtained using a Zeiss Axioskop II Plus. 
Images of fluorescently labeled cells were taken on a Zeiss LSM Pascal laser-scanning or an 
Olympus IX81 DSU confocal microscope and analyzed with ImageJ software.
Statistical analysis
Differences between two groups were analyzed using a Student t-test. One-way ANOVA 
was performed with Tukey’s post hoc test to evaluate the differences between three or more 
groups, and two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test was used for comparisons with 
more than one variable. A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
SelS and ER stress in neuronal cells
SelS is involved in removal of misfolded proteins from the ER lumen and protects against 
ER stress [20]. As pathology of AD is marked by aggregates of misfolded amyloid-β and tau 
proteins, we hypothesized that SelS could function to remove amyloid-β and tau to prevent 
the buildup of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. We first tested whether SelS is 
involved in protecting against ER stress in neurons, as it has been reported to do in other cell 
types [10, 11, 21]. We used three separate agents to induce ER stress via distinct 
mechanisms. In response to the ER stress induced by each agent, we consistently observed 
large increases in SelS mRNA (Fig. 1A, above) as well as SelS protein (Fig. 1A, below). To 
confirm induction of ER stress, we also looked at mRNA expression and splicing of the ER 
stress marker XBP1 [22]. Unconventional splicing of XBP1 to encode for an active 
transcription factor is induced following ER stress by the endonuclease inositol-requiring 
enzyme 1 (IRE1) [23]. Thapsigargin and tunicamycin significantly increased XBP1 mRNA 
levels (Fig. 1B, above). ER stress also led to splicing of XBP1 mRNA (Fig 1B, below). 
These findings confirm that SelS is regulated by ER stress in neural cells.

 Regulation of SelS expression by hyperglycemic conditions and selenium 
supplementation
Type 2 diabetes can increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. SelS was initially discovered as 
a glucose-regulated protein [24]. However, this has not been tested in brain cells. We found 
that hyperglycemic conditions (>10 mM glucose) for neuronal cells in culture suppressed 
SelS mRNA and protein levels. SelS expression was greatest at a glucose concentration near 
the normal range in brain (5 mM) [25] and decreased as glucose increased (Fig. 1C, above) 
[10, 11, 21]. Expression in 25 mM glucose was about 50% of the levels found at 5 mM 
glucose, when normalized to all three housekeeping genes. We also examined expression of 
SelS protein levels by western blot (Fig. 1C, below). As found with mRNA, SelS protein 
levels are decreased in 25 and 50 mM glucose conditions compared to 5 mM glucose, 
confirming an apparent downregulation of SelS in hyperglycemic conditions. Thus 
hyperglycemia with type II diabetes could suppress SelS expression and restrict its actions.
We investigated selenate and selenite supplementation on expression of SelS. As shown in 
Fig. 1D, increases in both selenate and selenite concentrations significantly increased SelS 
expression (Fig. 1D), This confirms that selenate can be utilized as a selenium source for 
selenoprotein synthesis in neuronal cells.
Selenoprotein S expression in human brain and SH-SY5Y neuronal cells
SelS has not previously been investigated in human brain. We first examined the location of 
SelS in postmortem human cortex using brain tissue from the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study. 
We observed SelS immunolabeling across cortical layers with slightly higher density in 
upper layers (Fig. 2A). We observed SelS immunoreactivity in small, branched cells as well 
as large pyramidal neurons in upper cortical layers. We also examined SelS 
immunoreactivity in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells (Fig. 2B). SelS was found in a ‘perinuclear’ 
pattern characteristic of ER-localized proteins. Immunoreactivity extended throughout the 
cell body surrounding the nucleus. SelS was also found in punctate labeling within cell 
processes.
Knockdown of SelS with siRNA
We investigated the role of SelS in neuroprotection by determining responses to oxidative 
stress following knockdown of SelS. We transfected SH-SY5Y cells with siRNA directed at 
both transcript variants. SelS expression was subtly but significantly reduced by over 25% 
(Fig. 3A). Knockdown of SelS decreased cell viability when compared to incubation with 
control siRNA (Fig 3B). Thapsigargin and brefeldin A further decreased cell viability 
compared to vehicle controls, with the combination of knockdown of SelS and induction of 
ER stress causing the greatest reduction. However, SelS siRNA with tunicamycin did not 
further decrease cell viability compared with tunicamycin and control siRNA, possibly 
indicating that tunicamycin occludes further reduction from SelS mRNA knockdown, and 
vice versa.
Selenate and tau phosphorylation
We examined if SelS might have a role in the selenate-induced reduction of tau 
phosphorylation. We examined tau phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells expressing the tau

 P301L mutation. Differentiated cells were treated for 1 h in OA before switching to Roth-
Schweitzer media [14] with 0, 0.1, 1 or 10 μM sodium selenate. Tau phosphorylation was 
then assayed in cell lysates by western blots (Fig. 4A). Increasing the selenate concentration 
did not alter total tau levels relative to tubulin (Fig. 4B). There was a trend toward decreased 
phosphorylation at threonine 212 (pT212) with increasing selenate concentrations, but the 
changes were not significant (Fig. 4C). However, phosphorylation at serine 214 (pS214) 
(Fig. 4D) and threonine 236 (pT236, detected with the AT180 antibody) (Fig. 4E) were 
significantly reduced after normalizing to total tau. There was a significant negative 
correlation between the decreased pS214 and pT236 and increased SelS expression (Fig. 
4F), indicating a potential role for SelS in reducing tau phosphorylation.
Tau phosphorylation regulated by SelS and ER stress
Recent studies have shown a connection between ER stress and formation of neurofibrillary 
tangles [26, 27]. We investigated whether loss of SelS expression would promote 
phosphorylation of tau under various conditions of ER stress. We used siRNA to knockdown 
expression of SelS in SH-SY5Y cells, and induced ER stress with tunicamycin to promote 
accumulation of unfolded proteins. SelS siRNA did not significantly reduce SelS protein 
relative to a negative control siRNA, shown in Fig. 5A and quantified in 5F. This is likely 
due to the limited knockdown of SelS mRNA (approximately 25%, as shown in Fig. 3A) 
combined with cell-to-cell variability. However, SelS siRNA did prevent an increase in SelS 
protein in response to tunicamycin, allowing examination of ER stress response without 
increased levels of SelS. SelS siRNA increased phosphorylation of tau at pT212 (Fig. 5C), 
but this increase was not further promoted by tunicamycin. However, combined tunicamycin 
treatment and knockdown of SelS together significantly increased phosphorylation of tau at 
the pS214 site (Fig. 5D). Phosphorylation at the tau serine 262 (pS262) site, as well as total 
tau, was not altered (Fig. 6E–F). Thus ER stress, when not accompanied by an increase in 
SelS, results in increased tau phosphorylation, suggesting that upregulation of SelS has a 
preventative role in neurofibrillary tangle formation.
We also investigated morphological changes in cells following ER stress and SelS siRNA 
using immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 6, tunicamycin induced aggregates of tau and 
tau pS214 immunoreactivity in cell bodies (arrowheads). Tunicamycin and SelS siRNA 
combined also increased pS214 immunoreactivity in neurites (arrows). The increased 
phosphorylated tau in soma and neurites is consistent with the promotion of neurofibrillary 
tangle formation.
Selenoprotein S expression in Alzheimer’s disease
We examined SelS in postmortem Alzheimer’s brain tissue in relation to Alzheimer’s 
disease markers, including amyloid-β plaques (deposits of the amyloid-β peptide) and 
neurofibrillary tangles. We compared SelS expression with tau, a primary component of 
neurofibrillary tangles and another hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. We observed a strong 
correlation of the immunoreactivity for tau with SelS (Fig. 7A). SelS immunoreactivity was 
more pronounced in neurons with neurofibrillary tangles. To determine the spatial 
relationship between SelS and deposition of amyloid-β, tissue was immunostained with 
antibodies to both SelS and amyloid-β (Fig. 7B). We did not find a correlation between SelS

 and amyloid-β plaques. This is in contrast to our previous observations of selenoprotein P 
(Sepp1) immunoreactivity in relation to amyloid-β in postmortem Alzheimer’s brain tissue 
[6]. Thus SelS expression correlates with neurofibrillary tangles, but not amyloid-β plaques.
DISCUSSION
In these studies, we found that SelS increases in negative correlation with tau 
phosphorylation. The restriction of SelS expression during ER stress results in increased tau 
phosphorylation, and also decreases cell viability. In postmortem human brain, we found 
SelS in neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles. These studies suggest that increased SelS 
expression may contribute to a reduction in tau phosphorylation by decreasing ER stress.
The unfolded protein response (UPR) is triggered by accumulation of misfolded proteins in 
the ER [28]. SelS is induced by the UPR [24] and forms a complex with the derlin proteins 
to assist in retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins from the ER [13, 29]. SelS is upregulated 
in astrocytes by ischemia and brain injury to reduce apoptotic cell death [10, 30]. Recent 
studies indicate that ER stress accompanies Alzheimer’s disease pathology and may 
potentiate cell loss in the disease [31, 32]. Markers of ER stress are upregulated in cortical 
and hippocampal neurons [33], and may increase tau phosphorylation [26, 27, 34]. 
Neurofibrillary tangles form when tau, which is involved in organizing microtubule 
formation, becomes hyperphosphorylated and loses its association with tubulin. This causes 
neurons to lose internal structure and form dense, insoluble masses. Additionally, tangles 
could further promote ER stress [35].
Other forms of selenium can also decrease pathology in different Alzheimer’s disease 
models. Sodium selenite can inhibit tau phosphorylation and cell death in vitro [36]. Selenite 
can also prevent streptozotocin-induced cognitive decline and oxidative damage [37] and 
reduce secretase activity and amyloid-β production in vitro [38]. Selenomethionine can 
reduce tau phosphorylation, amyloid-β, and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease mouse 
models [39, 40], and protects against oxidative stress from amyloid-β in vitro [41]. The 
glutathione peroxidase mimetic and organoselenium compound ebselen can reduce tau 
phosphorylation [42]. Other synthetic organoselenium compounds can improve cognitive 
impairments induced by streptozotocin and amyloid-β [43–46], and inhibit Cu-induced 
amyloid-β aggregates [47]. In contrast to supplementation studies, selenium deficiency 
increases amyloid-β deposition in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model [48].
Both inorganic and organic forms of selenium can act on both tau phosphorylation and 
amyloid-β. Both inorganic and organic forms of selenium can also increase synthesis of 
selenoproteins [49], which may facilitate these actions. However, different forms vary in 
facilitation of selenoprotein production and toxicity. The toxicity of sodium selenate is much 
lower than sodium selenite [1, 2, 49], and its benefit for selenium supply compared to its 
toxicity is more favorable than many forms. These properties, along with the potential for 
direct action on PP2A, indicate selenate may be a preferable form of selenium 
supplementation for prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders.

 In our studies, preventing upregulation of SelS in response to tunicamycin-induced ER stress 
through the use of siRNA resulted in increased phosphorylation of tau and accumulation of 
phosphorylated tau in neurite processes. These results suggest that SelS may serve as an 
important negative regulator of formation of neurofibrillary tangles. While upregulation of 
SelS in response to cellular stress would provide a compensatory action against tangle 
formation, this regulation may ultimately be overwhelmed over the course of the disease. 
Knockdown of SelS with siRNA also reduced cell viability (Fig. 3), despite the limited 
reduction of SelS mRNA and protein. This indicates an essential role for the protein in 
normal cell function. Changes in SelS expression and tau phosphorylation may be greater 
than depicted due to loss of cells most affected by siRNA.
Selenate supplementation may be a promising treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. Selenate 
decreases tau phosphorylation in models of neurofibrillary tangle formation, and may 
additionally decrease amyloid-β [50]. Selenate also reduces tau hyperphosphorylation and 
brain pathology in traumatic brain injury [51], and reduces seizures in rodent epilepsy 
models [52]. According to recent reports, selenium in the form of sodium selenate reduces 
neurofibrillary tangle formation [1, 2]. Additionally, selenate may reduce release of amyloid-
β, the major component of amyloid plaques [50]. The studies suggest selenate acts as an 
agonist for protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which reduces tau phosphorylation [53]. 
Knockdown or deletion of PP2A prevents selenate-induced dephosphorylation of tau [1, 2]. 
This supports the argument made in previous studies that selenate acts directly as an agonist 
of PP2A. However, dietary selenate is usually converted to other forms of selenium [49]. 
Selenium supplements generally increase serum levels of organic selenium and not inorganic 
selenium [54], and selenium transport to the brain is mediated by selenoprotein P (Sepp1) 
[55]. Regardless, our study and others demonstrate that selenate supplementation 
upregulates expression of selenoproteins [49], which could mediate or contribute to 
dephosphorylation of tau.
The presence of prominent SelS labeling in neurons containing tangles from postmortem 
tissue from individuals with Alzheimer’s disease as compared to controls is consistent with 
these findings, namely that these neurons had undergone significant stress resulting in 
upregulation of SelS. However, as Alzheimer’s disease progresses, expression may be 
limited by availability of selenium, and the increased expression may be insufficient to 
prevent tangle formation. The correlation of SelS expression with tau and not amyloid-β can 
be expected from the ER localization of SelS, and suggests its actions are limited to 
intracellular and not extracellular actions.
Interestingly, SelS is downregulated under hyperglycemic conditions. This suggests that 
brain expression of SelS might be reduced in diabetics with hyperglycemia. Diabetes greatly 
increases the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, with abnormal insulin signaling and 
accumulation of misfolded proteins common to both disorders [56, 57]. Our findings suggest 
that hyperglycemia could promote neurofibrillary tangle formation by reducing SelS levels.
The results reported herein indicate an important role for SelS in tau phosphorylation, and 
suggest a role for this protein in studies of selenate and dephosphorylation of tau. However, 
regardless of whether SelS and selenoproteins have any direct action on tau phosphorylation,

 selenate treatment will nonetheless increase selenoprotein expression. Therefore, we need a 
better understanding of the consequences of this increased expression in order to utilize 
selenate as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and other disorders. Moreover, selenate may 
have multiple targets both in and outside of the central nervous system, and identification of 
specific proteins regulated by selenate could provide more specific targets for therapeutic 
intervention.

Regulation of expression of SelS in SH-SY5Y cells by ER stress and selenium. A) Above: 
SelS mRNA measured with qPCR is increased following ER stress induced by tunicamycin, 
brefeldin A, or thapsigargin. Below: SelS protein (21 kDa) measured by western blot is also 
increased. Tubulin was used as a loading control. B) Above: XBP1 mRNA expression also 
increases with ER stress induction. Below: XBP1 splicing occurs following treatment with 
thapsigargin, brefeldin A, or tunicamycin. C) Glucose increases expression of SelS in SH-
SY5Y cells. Above: Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR measurements of SelS message 
levels in cells grown with different glucose levels. Expression of SelS decreases as glucose 
levels increase. In contrast, expression of another selenoprotein, SelW, is slightly elevated as 
glucose levels are increased. Below: SelS protein is decreased at higher glucose 
concentrations, shown by western blot. Alpha-tubulin is shown to demonstrate even loading. 
D) Sodium selenate (left) and selenite (right) both increase SelS expression. SH-SY5Y cells 
were grown in 0 Se media for 48 h, followed by supplementation with 1, 10, or 100 nm 
selenate or selenite for 3 days. Representative blots are shown above. Bar graphs show 
quantitation of SelS protein levels normalized to tubulin, relative to the 10 nM selenium 
samples. ∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.001.

Knockdown of SelS along with ER stress promotes phosphorylation of tau. SelS was 
knocked down with siRNA in SH-SY5Y cells with and without induction of ER stress by 
tunicamycin. Phosphorylation of tau was detected with antibodies recognizing tau 
phosphorylated at specific sites. A) Representative blots with antibodies to SelS, Tau-pT212, 
pS214, and S262, total tau, and tubulin as a loading control. B) Following knockdown of 
SelS, the increase in protein expression induced by tunicamycin is significantly reduced. C) 
Tau-pT212 phosphorylation increases with tunicamycin treatment. D) Tau-pS214 
phosphorylation is significantly increased only after SelS knockdown and treatment with 
tunicamycin. E) There is no significant change in Tau-pS262 phosphorylation. F) Total tau 
relative to tubulin does not change significantly with ER stress or SelS knockdown. ∗p <
