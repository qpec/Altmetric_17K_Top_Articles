Learning to associate cues or contexts with potential threats or rewards is adaptive and enhances survival. Both aversive and
appetitive memories are therefore powerful drivers of behaviour, but the inappropriate expression of conditioned responding to
fear- and drug-related stimuli can develop into anxiety-related and substance abuse disorders respectively. These disorders are
associated with abnormally persistent emotional memories and inadequate treatment, often leading to symptom relapse. Studies
show that cannabidiol, the main non-psychotomimetic phytocannabinoid found in Cannabis sativa, reduces anxiety via 5-HT1A
and (indirect) cannabinoid receptor activation in paradigms assessing innate responses to threat. There is also accumulating
evidence from animal studies investigating the effects of cannabidiol on fear memory processing indicating that it reduces learned
fear in paradigms that are translationally relevant to phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. Cannabidiol does so by reducing
fear expression acutely and by disrupting fear memory reconsolidation and enhancing fear extinction, both of which can result in
a lasting reduction of learned fear. Recent studies have also begun to elucidate the effects of cannabidiol on drug memory ex-
pression using paradigms with translational relevance to addiction. The findings suggest that cannabidiol reduces the expression
of drug memories acutely and by disrupting their reconsolidation. Here, we review the literature demonstrating the anxiolytic
effects of cannabidiol before focusing on studies investigating its effects on various fear and drug memory processes. Under-
standing how cannabidiol regulates emotion and emotional memory processing may eventually lead to its use as a treatment for
anxiety-related and substance abuse disorders.

 Introduction
Anxiety (e.g. generalized and social anxiety, panic and pho-
bias), trauma-related [i.e. post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]
and substance abuse disorders are serious forms of mental
illness associated with a significant lifetime prevalence. These
disorders pose an enormous social and financial burden as they
are often chronic in nature and inadequately treated (Di Luca
et al., 2011). Certain anxiety-related disorders (e.g. phobias
and PTSD) and addiction are characterized by aberrant and per-
sistent emotional memories of fear- and drug-related stimuli.
These discrete or contextual cues can trigger the emergence of
symptoms
or
even
their
re-emergence
after
treatment,
highlighting the limited effectiveness of the psychological
and pharmacological therapies currently available to curtail
symptom relapse over the long-term (Tronson and Taylor,
2013; Everitt, 2014; Kindt, 2014; Singewald et al., 2015). More-
over, there is also significant co-morbidity between substance
abuse disorders and PTSD, which can further complicate how
PTSD develops and is treated. For example, the learning and
memory processes involved in the psychological therapies that
are used for treating PTSD can be adversely affected by different
drugs of abuse, which may also have complex drug–drug inter-
actions with pharmacological treatments for PTSD (Tipps et al.,
2014). Thus, there is an urgent need to improve the treatment
of these disorders.
An area of real promise in this field involves the use of
existing or novel medications as adjuncts to psychological
therapies to enhance the efficacy of treatment. Cannabidiol
(CBD) is one such drug that shows therapeutic potential in
a broad range of neurological and psychiatric diseases
(Campos et al., 2012b). This phytocannabinoid is the main
non-psychotomimetic constituent of the Cannabis sativa
plant, and mounting evidence indicates that CBD has
anxiolytic
properties
(Blessing
et
al.,
2015).
Emerging
preclinical and clinical evidence also indicates that CBD
regulates different aversive and appetitive memory pro-
cesses (Prud’homme et al., 2015; Jurkus et al., 2016), in
keeping with the findings of recent studies showing a role
for CBD in modulating other types of memory, such as
novel object and social recognition, in cognitively-impaired
animals (Fagherazzi et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2014). In this
paper, we begin with a brief historical account of the dis-
covery of CBD and touch on the first studies that investi-
gated its behavioural effects in rodents and humans. We
then review the literature on CBD regulation of anxiety
and the pharmacological and brain mechanisms involved.
The bulk of the paper focuses on discussing the findings
from the growing number of studies, mostly preclinical,
that have examined the regulation of learned fear and,
more recently, addictive drug memory processing by CBD.
Importantly, these studies have used experimental proce-
dures with clinical relevance for understanding the psycho-
logical and neurobiological mechanisms involved in the
pathophysiology and treatment of anxiety-related and sub-
stance abuse disorders.
CBD discovery and initial studies on its
behavioural effects
The C. sativa plant contains more than 100 chemically re-
lated terpenephenol components called phytocannabinoids
(Izzo
et
al.,
2009;
Gould,
2015).
Since
the
seminal
work
of
Raphael
Mechoulam’s
group
in
the
1960s,
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC)
is
considered
the
main
component responsible for the pharmacological effects of
the plant (Gaoni and Mechoulam, 1964). The second major

 component of most samples of C. sativa is CBD. Originally
isolated by Adams and co-workers in 1940 (Adams et al.,
1940), its structure was elucidated by Mechoulam and Shvo
(1963). Although the CBD molecule is similar to THC, it
has a distinct spatial conformation that could help to explain
their different pharmacological properties. Whereas THC has
a planar conformation, CBD presents a ‘bent’ structure with
two rings at a right angle to each other (Burstein, 2015).
Initial studies performed in the 1970s, mostly in Brazil,
indicated that CBD could block some effects induced by
THC in rodents (Karniol and Carlini, 1973; Russo and
Guy, 2006). Following these initial studies, Zuardi and
collaborators investigated if CBD could prevent the effects
of high doses of THC in healthy human volunteers. They
found
that
it
attenuates
the
psychotomimetic
and
anxiogenic effects of THC (Zuardi et al., 1982). Although
the
mechanisms
of
action
of
these
two
drugs
were
completely unknown at that time, the fact that not all
effects of THC were blocked by CBD indicated that the
latter was not simply an antagonist of a putative THC
receptor. On the contrary, the study suggested that CBD
possesses its own antipsychotic and anxiolytic properties
(Zuardi et al., 1982).
Laboratory animal tests used to assess
the anxiolytic properties of CBD
The potential anxiolytic effect of CBD was initially investi-
gated in preclinical studies. Several animal tests have been
employed to explore the effects of putative anxiolytic
drugs and the neurobiology of anxiety, which can be
defined separately from fear as the emotional response to
potential or anticipated (as opposed to actual and present)
threat (Tovote et al., 2015). These tests are based on the
measurement of defensive behaviours (either active or
inhibitory)
expressed
in
response
to
a
threatening
or
unpleasant stimulus (Campos et al., 2013a). The initial
preclinical studies investigating the possible anxiolytic-like
effects of CBD were performed in learning-based models
and produced mixed results. These apparently conflicting
results were later explained by Guimarães et al. (1990)
using the elevated plus-maze (EPM). This is a commonly
used test to investigate anxiety-like behaviour in preclini-
cal studies and is based on the natural aversion that
rodents
show
to
open
spaces
(Handley
and
Mithani,
1984; Pellow et al., 1985; Treit et al., 1993; Carobrez and
Bertoglio, 2005).
Using the EPM and performing a full dose–response curve
in rats, Guimarães and co-workers showed that acute systemic
administration
of
CBD
produces
a
typical
‘bell-shaped’
dose–response curve, being anxiolytic at low and intermediate
doses but not at high doses. Although some contradictory
results exist in the literature, most studies using unlearned or
operant conditioning models of anxiety have confirmed these
initial findings, and the studies investigating CBD effects in
classical (Pavlovian) conditioning models also go in the same
direction, which will be discussed separately below (summa-
rized in Tables 1 and 2). Moreover, these anxiolytic effects of
CBD in animals have been replicated in human studies using
healthy subjects exposed to anxiety-provoking stimuli or
situations (Zuardi et al., 1982, 1993; Crippa et al., 2004; Fusar-
Poli et al., 2009, 2010) and in patients with anxiety, and possi-
bly also substance abuse, disorders (Bergamaschi et al., 2011,
Crippa
et
al.,
2011;
Hurd
et
al.,
2015;
Shannon
and
Opila-Lehman, 2016; summarized in Table 3).
Pharmacological mechanisms and brain
sites involved in the anxiolytic effects
of CBD
The potential therapeutic effects of CBD have been related
to multiple pharmacological mechanisms, including the
agonism
of
5-HT1A
receptors,
inhibition
of
reuptake
and/or metabolism of the endocannabinoid anandamide
(resulting indirectly in cannabinoid receptor activation),
activation
of
transient
receptor
potential
vanilloid
1
(TRPV1) channels, inhibition of adenosine reuptake, antag-
onism of GPR55, agonism of PPARγ receptors, intracellular
Ca2+ increase, and anti-oxidative effects, among others
(summarized in Figure 1). These pharmacological mecha-
nisms have been discussed recently in several reviews (Izzo
et al., 2009; Campos et al., 2012a; Ibeas Bih et al., 2015;
McPartland et al., 2015), to which the reader is referred.
So far, however, only two of these mechanisms – 5-HT1A
receptor
activation
and
indirect
potentiation
of
endocannabinoid transmission – have been implicated in
the attenuation of defensive responses to threatening or
stressful stimuli.
Two primary brain systems organize defensive responses
to threatening stimuli: one responsive to innate threats and
the other responsible for the association between neutral
and aversive stimuli, although the neural circuit mecha-
nisms underlying the regulation of anxiety and learned fear
show considerable overlap (for reviews, see McNaughton
and Corr, 2004; Canteras et al., 2010; Gross & Canteras,
2012; Tovote et al., 2015). The brain areas implicated in
the anxiolytic effects of cannabidiol include certain medial
prefrontal
cortical
subregions
[e.g.
prelimbic
(PL)
and
infralimbic
(IL)
cortex],
the
bed
nucleus
of
the
stria
terminalis (BNST), periaqueductal gray (PAG) and amygdala.
This evidence comes from preclinical studies and functional
imaging studies in humans, which have confirmed the
involvement of some of these brain areas. For example,
CBD
reduced
amygdala
activation
in
both
mice
and
humans (Todd and Arnold, 2016; Crippa et al., 2004).
Activity
in
and
functional
connectivity
between
the
amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, the homologous
region to the rodent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, were
both also decreased by CBD when viewing fearful facial
expressions (Fusar-Poli et al., 2009; 2010).
In an initial preclinical study using the EPM test, Campos
and Guimarães (2008) showed that the anxiolytic-like effects
of CBD injected into the dorsolateral PAG (dlPAG) were
prevented by local treatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antag-
onist WAY100635. Even if this drug can also activate D4
receptors (Chemel et al., 2006), the anti-aversive effects of
CBD were similar to other 5-HT1A receptor agonists infused
into the dlPAG (Graeff, 2002). The involvement of the
5-HT1A receptor in the acute anxiolytic/anti-stress effect of

 CBD was further demonstrated in other relevant brain
regions, including the BNST (Gomes et al., 2011) and IL cortex
(Marinho et al., 2015). Moreover, systemic treatment with
5-HT1A receptor antagonists was also able to prevent this
CBD-induced anxiolysis (see Table 1).
In the marble-burying test and after repeated administra-
tion, however, CBD effects on anxiety seem to depend on
CB1 receptors rather than 5-HT1A receptors (Casarotto et al.,
2010; Campos et al., 2013a; Nardo et al., 2014). Even if the
(+)-CBD enantiomer shows affinity for CB1 receptors, the nat-
urally occurring (�) CBD does not bind to these receptors
(Hanuš et al., 2005), indicating that the CB1 receptor-
mediated anti-aversive effects of CBD are probably indirect.
Bisogno et al. (2001) showed that CBD blocked the reuptake
and metabolism of anandamide in vitro. Correspondingly,
using embryonic hippocampal cells, Campos et al. (2013b)
showed that the increase in cell proliferation induced by
CBD is prevented by antagonism of either CB1 or CB2
receptors, as well as by overexpression of fatty acid amide hy-
drolase (FAAH), the enzyme responsible for anandamide me-
tabolism. More recently, Dale Deutsch’s group demonstrated
that CBD binds to fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) neces-
sary for the transport of anandamide from the plasma mem-
brane to intracellular FAAH, which might be a primary
mechanism
by
which
CBD
decreases
anandamide
uptake/metabolism (Elmes et al., 2015). Consistent with
these in vitro studies, the anti-stress (in mice) and antipsy-
chotic (in humans) effects of repeated CBD administration
were associated with increased hippocampal and serum
levels, respectively, of anandamide (Leweke et al., 2012,
Campos et al., 2013b).
Emotional learning and memory
processing
We will first summarize the psychological mechanisms in-
volved in classical conditioning, a type of associative learning
whereby discrete cues or contexts come to predict the occur-
rence of threatening or rewarding stimuli, before reviewing
the evidence demonstrating a role for CBD in regulating dif-
ferent fear and drug memory processes. During conditioning,

seeking
(e.g.
lever

preference)
responses
(Peters et al., 2009). Retrieval of the CS can make emotional
memories labile by destabilizing the memory trace, which
allows for these memories to be maintained or updated
through the process of reconsolidation (Lee, 2009). Repeated
presentations of or prolonged exposure to the CS causes the
extinction of emotional memories, resulting in the formation
of a new CS–no US association which competes with the orig-
inal emotional memory to suppress conditioned responding
to the CS (Peters et al., 2009). Understanding how behav-
ioural and/or pharmacological interventions can attenuate
conditioned responding, disrupt memory reconsolidation
and/or enhance extinction has clinical relevance given that
all of these mechanisms are potential therapeutic strategies
for alleviating the symptoms of PTSD (i.e. pathological fear)
and addiction (i.e. drug craving) (Tronson and Taylor, 2013;
Everitt, 2014; Kindt, 2014; Singewald et al., 2015).
CBD effects on fear memory processing
As alluded to above, there is growing evidence indicating that
CBD also regulates learned fear (see Table 2). Systemic CBD
administration has been shown to reduce the expression of
fear memory when given acutely (Zuardi and Karniol, 1983;
Resstel et al., 2006; Lemos et al., 2010; Jurkus et al., 2016).
CBD has also been reported to impair the acquisition of fear
learning; acute systemic administration before fear condi-
tioning resulted in attenuated fear expression during later
memory retrieval testing (Levin et al., 2012). In contrast,
there are few reported effects of repeated CBD administration
on fear memory expression and those that exist are conflict-
ing. In one study, daily injections of CBD for 14 days prior
to conditioning enhanced fear expression during retrieval
testing, suggesting that chronic CBD facilitated fear learning
(ElBatsh et al., 2012), whereas another study showed no effect
of CBD on fear conditioning when it was administered for
21 days (Cheng et al., 2014).
The results of several studies indicate that CBD also mod-
ulates the extinction and reconsolidation of conditioned fear,
leading to lasting effects on learned fear expression. I.c.v. in-
fusions of CBD given before three extinction sessions resulted
in enhanced contextual fear extinction (Bitencourt et al.,
2008). Systemic administration of CBD given acutely before
extinction has been shown to affect contextual fear extinc-
tion depending on the strength of fear conditioning before-
hand. CBD impaired extinction after weak conditioning but
enhanced extinction after strong conditioning (Song et al.,
2016). However, CBD given systemically before auditory fear
extinction reduced fear expression acutely without affecting
extinction memory (Jurkus et al., 2016). Interestingly, a study
in humans also showed that CBD had no effect on the extinc-
tion of visual fear memory when given before extinction, but
it did enhance extinction memory when given immediately
after extinction (Das et al., 2013).
Contrary to the reported facilitatory effects of CBD on fear
extinction,
this
drug
has
been
shown
to
disrupt
the
reconsolidation of contextual fear memory after its brief
retrieval (Stern et al., 2012; 2015; Gazarini et al., 2015),
although these contrasting effects of CBD on fear extinction
and memory reconsolidation both result in a lasting reduc-
tion of learned fear expression. The disruptive effect of
Figure 1
The main molecular targets and potential mechanisms of action of CBD. This drug inhibits both FAAH, the enzyme which metabolizes ananda-
mide, and FABPs, which mediate the transport of anandamide to FAAH; both mechanisms ultimately result in the indirect activation of CB1
and/or CB2 receptors. CBD also activates the 5-HT1A receptor, PPARγ and the transient receptor potential channels TRPV1, TRPA1 and TRPV2.
Finally, CBD inhibits adenosine reuptake and antagonizes GPR55, TRPM8 and T-type Ca2+ channels. 5-HT1A and (indirect) cannabinoid receptor
activation are the mechanisms that have been implicated in the anxiolytic effects of CBD to date (see Ibeas Bih et al. (2015) and McPartland et al.
(2015) for further details).

 systemic CBD administration on reconsolidation required
that it was given immediately after memory retrieval as CBD
had no effect if it was given without, or 6 h after, retrieval.
CBD was also able to disrupt the reconsolidation of both
newer and older fear memories. Moreover, the subsequent
reduction of learned fear expression lasted for over 21 days
and was not reinstated by later shock presentation, indicating
that the effects of CBD were due to disrupted memory
reconsolidation and not enhanced extinction (Stern et al.,
2012).
In another study, CBD given immediately after retrieval
disrupted the reconsolidation of an abnormally persistent
fear memory when the partial NMDA receptor agonist
D-cycloserine was first administered before retrieval to facili-
tate memory destabilization. Fear memory was strengthened
pharmacologically by enhancing adrenergic transmission
immediately after conditioning, resulting in generalized fear
expression and impaired fear suppression by extinction
(Gazarini et al., 2015). Understanding the mechanisms un-
derlying reconsolidation disruption of such fear memories is
important because there is evidence indicating that strong
fear memories can show resistance to pharmacological dis-
ruption of reconsolidation (Lee, 2009), which has implica-
tions for using this potential therapeutic approach to
weaken traumatic memories in the treatment of PTSD.
Pharmacological mechanisms and brain
sites involved in the effects of CBD on
learned fear
Just as the anxiolytic effects of CBD involve a direct effect on
5-HT1A receptors and an indirect effect on cannabinoid recep-
tors via elevated endocannabinoid levels, so too do its effects
on different fear memory processes. Similarly, there is overlap
in the neural circuitry involved in mediating the effects of
CBD on anxiety and learned fear. The reduction in condi-
tioned fear expression induced by CBD was accompanied by
attenuated c-Fos expression in the PL and IL cortices and the
BSNT. Moreover, CBD infusion into the BNST or PL cortex
reduced fear memory expression, although infusing CBD into
the IL cortex enhanced the expression of learned fear (Lemos
et al., 2010). This discrepancy between the effects of CBD in-
fused into the PL or IL cortex is probably due to these medial
prefrontal cortical subregions exerting opposing influences
on learned fear, with the former facilitating its expression
and the latter being involved in its suppression and/or extinc-
tion (Fenton et al., 2014; Giustino and Maren, 2015). The reg-
ulation of conditioned fear expression by CBD in these brain
areas was shown to be dependent on 5-HT1A receptors (Gomes
et al., 2012; Fogaça et al., 2014; Marinho et al., 2015). The in-
hibitory effect of CBD on the acquisition of fear conditioning
has also been shown to depend on 5-HT1A receptor activation
in the nucleus accumbens shell (Norris et al., 2016).
In contrast to the acquisition and expression of fear
memory, the reconsolidation and extinction of learned fear
involve (indirect) cannabinoid receptor activation. The
facilitatory effect of i.c.v. CBD infusion on fear extinction
was inhibited by prior CB1 receptor antagonism but not
TRPV1 channel blockade (Bitencourt et al., 2008). CBD was
shown to act in the IL cortex to facilitate fear extinction as
infusing CBD into this region enhanced extinction, an effect
which also depended on CB1 receptors (Do Monte et al.,
2013). The disruptive effect of CBD on fear memory
reconsolidation was blocked by pretreatment with a CB1
receptor antagonist given systemically or infused into the
PL cortex, whereas prior 5-HT1A receptor antagonism had
no effect on the disruption of reconsolidation by CBD (Stern
et al., 2012; 2014).
CBD effects on addictive drug memory
processing
In contrast to the study of fear memories, to date there has
been a much more limited exploration of the effects of CBD
on addictive drug-related memories. This necessitates a narra-
tive review of the relevant literature, which follows below.
Moreover, the small number of studies has been conducted
across a variety of experimental paradigms and with different
drugs of abuse. These drugs can elicit sensitized responses
with
intermittent
repeated
administration,
which
is
context-dependent and thereby reliant upon context-drug
associations. Similarly, the acquisition and expression of con-
ditioned place preference behaviour depends upon the integ-
rity of context-drug and/or cue-drug associations. Finally,
cue-drug associations can precipitate cue-induced relapse of
drug seeking in rodents previously trained to self-administer
a drug (Aguilar et al., 2009; Steketee and Kalivas, 2011). Each
of these paradigms can be studied using stimulants (e.g.
cocaine
and
amphetamine),
opiates
(e.g.
heroin
and
morphine), and other drugs (e.g. alcohol and nicotine).
Unlike THC, studies have shown that CBD lacks any re-
warding effects of its own given that it fails to induce condi-
tioned place preference or enhance the reinforcing effects of
electrical brain self-stimulation (Parker et al., 2004; Vann et al.,
2008; Katsidoni et al., 2013). In a study of amphetamine-
induced locomotor sensitization, infusions of CBD (100 ng)
into the shell subregion of the nucleus accumbens attenuated
the development of locomotor sensitization (Renard et al.,
2016). While this might suggest that CBD impaired the
formation of an amphetamine memory that supports locomo-
tor sensitization, these findings were within the context of
mesolimbic mechanisms involved in the potential antipsy-
chotic action of CBD. Moreover, even though the attenuation
of locomotor sensitization was paralleled by modulation of cel-
lular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, it remains a challenge
to distinguish learning-related behavioural effects from modu-
lation of drug reward (cf. Katsidoni et al., 2013; Prud’homme
et al., 2015), which would impact upon reward-dependent
learning. The non-mnemonic interpretation is supported by a
failure of CBD to prevent the acquisition of amphetamine place
preference (Parker et al., 2004). However, while it appears that
CBD does not disrupt the formation of amphetamine-related
memories, this does not rule out potential effects on memories
formed in relation to other drugs of abuse.
Subsequent to their acquisition, CBD might affect the
expression of drug memories. Here there appears to be a dis-
parity depending upon the drug reward under study. Acute
administration of CBD (5 and 10 mg·kg�1) did not alter co-
caine self-administration or cue-induced relapse to cocaine

 seeking (Mahmud et al., 2016) and so failed to replicate an
earlier study of heroin self-administration (Ren et al., 2009).
While CBD (5 and 20 mg·kg�1) similarly did not alter heroin
self-administration, it did have an effect on cue-induced
relapse to heroin seeking (Ren et al., 2009), a measure of
cue-heroin memory expression. CBD (5 mg·kg�1) reduced
responding in a cue-induced relapse test but only when given
24 h, and not 30 min, prior to the test. This long-lasting effect
on the expression of the cue-heroin memory was even more
persistent (up to 14 days) when three consecutive daily injec-
tions of 5 mg·kg�1 CBD were given. This ability of CBD to
have such long-lasting effects may be mediated by an up-
regulation of AMPA GluA1 receptors in the nucleus accum-
bens (Ren et al., 2009).
The impaired expression of cue-heroin relapse in response
to CBD administration in animals suggests that this drug
might have anti-relapse properties in opiate addiction in
humans. This has been explored in a preliminary study of
heroin addicts, in which participants were given daily doses
of CBD (400 or 800 mg) or placebo for 3 days (Hurd et al.,
2015). CBD reduced craving both 24 h and 7 days later,
mirroring the preclinical rodent study (Ren et al., 2009). This
beneficial effect of CBD may not be limited to opiate addic-
tion as a conceptually similar, albeit more modest, effect has
also been observed in tobacco smokers (Morgan et al., 2013).
In this small week-long study, smokers were instructed to in-
hale a metered dose of CBD (400 μg) or placebo when they felt
like smoking. CBD acutely reduced the number of cigarettes
smoked, but this effect was not maintained after the cessation
of CBD administration. Interestingly, and in contrast to the
heroin study, CBD did not alter craving, either acutely or per-
sistently. Therefore, it is not clear whether CBD has general-
ized effects on the expression of cue-drug memory to elicit
craving and precipitate relapse, or whether its effects are spe-
cific to certain classes of addictive drugs.
For the maintenance (i.e. reconsolidation) of drug-related
memories, there is a single study on morphine and cocaine con-
ditioned place preference. When the place preference memory
was briefly reactivated in order to trigger reconsolidation, CBD
administration (10 mg·kg�1) immediately thereafter led to an
impairment in the subsequent maintenance of both cocaine
and morphine memories to reduce place preference at test
(de Carvalho and Takahashi, 2016). This was a long-lasting
effect, which is usually evidence for reconsolidation impair-
ments. However, the study lacked a true non-reactivation
control, and so the long-lasting impairment, especially for
morphine place preference, is not dissimilar to the aforemen-
tioned persistent reduction in the expression of cue-heroin
memories in the self-administration setting (Ren et al., 2009).
Therefore, it is still unclear whether CBD indeed impairs the
reconsolidation of drug memories. Nevertheless, there are indi-
cations from the comparison between the place preference and
self-administration studies to suggest that their results might be
underpinned by qualitatively different processes. For example,
while the CBD-induced impairment failed to ameliorate
heroin-primed reinstatement of drug seeking (Ren et al.,
2009), post-reactivation CBD did prevent morphine-primed re-
instatement of place preference (de Carvalho and Takahashi,
2016). Moreover, the contrasting effects of post-reactivation
CBD and acute CBD treatment on the subsequent expression
of cocaine memories (de Carvalho and Takahashi, 2016)
suggest that the impairment in cocaine place preference is not
simply explained by long-lasting modulation of drug memory
expression.
Similarly, there is a single study on the effect of CBD on
drug memory extinction. Injection of CBD (5 mg·kg�1) prior
to an extinction trial enhanced the subsequent reduction in
cocaine and amphetamine place preference (Parker et al.,
2004). Despite the lack of a no-extinction control, the obser-
vation that CBD reduces the expression of stimulant-induced
place preference again suggests that such a reduction was, at
least in part, due to the concomitant extinction trial. Interest-
ingly, the ability of CBD to reduce cocaine and amphetamine
place preference in this extinction study (Parkeret al., 2004) is
similar to the previous observation that CBD impairs the
reconsolidation of morphine and cocaine memories in the
same place preference setting (de Carvalho and Takahashi,
2016). Indeed, while there was a difference in the timing of
CBD administration between the two studies, the single
behavioural trial that served to extinguish (Parker et al.,
2004) or destabilize (de Carvalho and Takahashi, 2016) the
drug memory did not differ greatly. The extinction trial was
15 min in duration, compared with a 10 min reactivation
trial, although the former was confined to the drug-paired
chamber, whereas the latter was a test. Moreover, the condi-
tioning parameters were similar across the two studies, and
also to previous studies of reconsolidation that have used
30 min confined reactivation trials for amphetamine place
preference (Sakurai et al., 2007), 20 min confined reactivation
trials for cocaine place preference (Valjent et al., 2006) and
10 min confined reactivation trials for morphine and nico-
tine place preference (Wang et al., 2008; Fang et al., 2011).
Also, given that the parameters of appetitive memory
reconsolidation and extinction are usually well distin-
guished, such that they are each typically defined by very
different durations of context re-exposure or numbers of cue
presentations (Flavell and Lee, 2013), it is unclear if CBD both
enhances extinction and impairs reconsolidation of drug
memories. It is perhaps more likely that the ability of CBD
to reduce later drug place preference observed in these two
studies (Parker et al., 2004; de Carvalho and Takahashi,
2016) instead reflects qualitatively similar processes. By sim-
ply considering the parametric comparisons presented above,
we conclude that there is stronger evidence for CBD
impairing drug memory reconsolidation than there is for it
enhancing drug memory extinction. Furthermore, given that
pharmacological
enhancement
of
extinction
is
usually
dependent upon appreciable extinction-mediated memory
reduction (Weber et al., 2007; Bouton et al., 2008), and there
was no evidence for any such reduction in the CBD study
(Parker et al., 2004), it remains unclear if CBD actually
enhances drug memory extinction.
Concluding remarks and future
directions
Converging lines of evidence have established that acute
CBD treatment is anxiolytic in both animals and humans. A
growing number of preclinical studies also indicate that this
drug reduces fear memory expression when given acutely.
Importantly, CBD produces an enduring reduction in learned

 fear expression when given in conjunction with fear memory
reconsolidation or extinction by disrupting the former and
facilitating the latter. This makes CBD a potential candidate
for testing as a pharmacological adjunct to psychological
therapies or behavioural interventions used in treating PTSD
and phobias. These effects of CBD are mediated at least in part
by 5-HT1A receptors and indirectly via endocannabinoid-
mediated action on cannabinoid receptors, although the
involvement of other possible pharmacological mechanisms
has not yet been investigated. Studies have begun to elucidate
the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the effects of CBD
on anxiety and learned fear. The recent functional imaging
studies in humans, which examined the alterations in brain
activity that accompany the anxiolytic effects of CBD, may
inform future preclinical and clinical studies investigating
the wider neural circuitry involved in mediating its effects
on learned fear. In contrast to anxiety and learned fear,
research into the effects of CBD on addictive drug memory
processing is still in its infancy. Therefore, further studies
are needed to determine the psychological, pharmacological,
and brain mechanisms involved in the attenuation of drug
memory expression by CBD in relation to different classes
of abused drugs. Given the significant co-morbidity between
anxiety-related and substance abuse disorders, CBD should
also be investigated as a common treatment for such disor-
ders. One outstanding issue that needs to be addressed is
determining the effects of chronic CBD treatment on different
emotional memory processes. For example, one potential ther-
apeutic strategy is to use CBD chronically to reduce symptoms
by dampening fear and/or drug memory expression. However,
CBD given acutely during the psychological therapy session
aimed at impairing memory reconsolidation or enhancing
extinction might be sufficient to facilitate this effect. Another
important consideration is how CBD would be delivered for
treating these disorders. Most of the recreationally used
cannabis available today contains low levels of CBD and high
levels of THC, which can exacerbate symptoms; however,
cannabis strains containing a more favourable CBD : THC ratio
might be an option (Hurd et al., 2015). Similarly, novel formula-
tions of CBD containing only
trace amounts
of other
phytocannabinoids have recently become available for the
putative treatment of childhood epileptic disorders (e.g.
Epidiolex, GW Pharmaceuticals; Gofshteyn et al., 2016). In
summary, this line of research may lead to the development
of a formulation of CBD for use as a treatment for anxiety-
related and substance abuse disorders in the future.
