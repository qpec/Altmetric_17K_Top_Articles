BACKGROUND: Reduction in cardiovascular death and hospitalization 
for heart failure (HHF) was recently reported with the sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) empagliflozin in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus who have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We 
compared HHF and death in patients newly initiated on any SGLT-2i versus 
other glucose-lowering drugs in 6 countries to determine if these benefits are 
seen in real-world practice and across SGLT-2i class.
METHODS: Data were collected via medical claims, primary care/hospital 
records, and national registries from the United States, Norway, Denmark, 
Sweden, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Propensity score for SGLT-2i 
initiation was used to match treatment groups. Hazard ratios for HHF, death, 
and their combination were estimated by country and pooled to determine 
weighted effect size. Death data were not available for Germany.
RESULTS: After propensity matching, there were 309 
056 patients newly 
initiated on either SGLT-2i or other glucose-lowering drugs (154 
528 patients 
in each treatment group). Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin 
accounted for 53%, 42%, and 5% of the total exposure time in the SGLT-2i  
class, respectively. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 
groups. There were 961 HHF cases during 190 
164 person-years follow-up 
(incidence rate, 0.51/100 person-years). Of 215 
622 patients in the United 
States, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, death occurred 
in 1334 (incidence rate, 0.87/100 person-years), and HHF or death in 1983 
(incidence rate, 1.38/100 person-years). Use of SGLT-2i, versus other glucose-
lowering drugs, was associated with lower rates of HHF (hazard ratio, 0.61; 
95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.73; P<0.001); death (hazard ratio, 0.49; 
95% confidence interval, 0.41–0.57; P<0.001); and HHF or death (hazard 
ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.60; P<0.001) with no significant 
heterogeneity by country.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large multinational study, treatment with SGLT-2i 
versus other glucose-lowering drugs was associated with a lower risk of 
HHF and death, suggesting that the benefits seen with empagliflozin in a 
randomized trial may be a class effect applicable to a broad population of 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in real-world practice.

T
ype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) remains a major risk 
factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)1,2 and overall 
mortality,3,4 despite advances in treatment.5–7 Heart 
failure is an especially common complication of T2D,8–10 
with particularly poor outcomes and 5-year survival 
rates of <25%.11 This highlights the need for novel 
treatments that not only improve glycemic control, but 
also reduce the risk of CVD, including heart failure.
Although higher hemoglobin A1c is associated with 
greater risk of CVD,12 intensive glucose control has 
failed to reduce the development of heart failure, and 
cardiovascular-related or all-cause death. However, the 
EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (BI 10773 [Empagliflozin] 
Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus Patients), a prospective randomized controlled 
trial in patients with T2D and established atheroscle-
rotic CVD, demonstrated a substantial reduction in car-
diovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure 
(HHF) with the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibi-
tor (SGLT-2i), empagliflozin,13 within a short follow-up 
period. The mechanisms of these benefits, although un-
clear, were almost certainly not attributable to glucose 
lowering, given a very small difference in hemoglobin 
A1c levels between empagliflozin- and placebo-treated 
patients and early separation of the event curves.
Following the EMPA-REG OUTCOMES trial, several 
critical questions remain, with substantial clinical implica-
tions. First, the applicability of findings to real-world clini-
cal practice (where patients receive standard of care with 
various other glucose-lowering drugs [oGLDs]) is unclear. 
Second, it is unknown whether the observed benefits 
are specific to empagliflozin, or represent a class effect. 
Finally, because EMPA-REG OUTCOME only included pa-
tients with established CVD, it remains to be seen if simi-
lar benefits can be expected in patients with T2D who 
have a broader cardiovascular risk profile.
Using data from multiple countries in the CVD-
REAL study (Comparative Effectiveness of Cardiovas-
cular Outcomes in New Users of SGLT-2 Inhibitors: 
NCT02993614), we compared the risk for HHF, death, 
and the combined end point of HHF or death in pa-
tients with T2D who were new users of SGLT-2i versus 
oGLDs in real-world practice.
METHODS
Data Sources
Deidentified health records across 6 countries (United States, 
Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the United 
Kingdom) were analyzed. In the United States, Truven Health 
MarketScan Claims and Encounters and linked Medicare 
Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits databases were 
used, which included enrollment and demographic informa-
tion, inpatient and outpatient medical, and outpatient phar-
macy claims from >300 large self-insured US employers and 
>25 US health plans. In Germany, the Diabetes Prospective 
Follow-Up initiative is a quality assessment registry for individ-
uals with diabetes mellitus and uses standardized documen-
tation and objective comparison of quality indicators, with 
452 centers participating. In Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, 
mandatory national full-population registries of each respec-
tive country were used, with linked Prescribed Drug Registers 
covering all drugs dispensed, National Patient Registers cover-
ing all hospitalizations and specialized outpatient care, and 
Cause of Death Registers.14–17 In the United Kingdom, records 
from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and The Health 
Improvement Network data sets were used, which included 
primary care data from >670 general practices linked with 
hospitalization and mortality registries. Additional details of 
the individual data sets can be found in the online-only Data 
Supplement Appendix.
Patient Cohort
Patients with T2D (diagnosis codes in online-only Data 
Supplement Tables I and II) who were newly started on either 
SGLT-2i or oGLDs were selected from each data set beginning 
on the date of first prescription or pharmacy dispensation 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This is the first large real-world study of >300 
000 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, both with 
and without established cardiovascular disease, 
from routine clinical practice across 6 countries, 
evaluating the outcomes of hospitalization for 
heart failure (HHF) and all-cause death in patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with sodium-
glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) versus 
other glucose-lowering drugs.
• The distribution of exposure time for the various 
SGLT-2i compounds (for HHF outcome) was 53% 
for canagliflozin, 42% for dapagliflozin, and ≈5% 
for empagliflozin, with substantial intercountry 
variability.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Treatment with SGLT-2i versus other glucose-lower-
ing drugs was associated with a 39% relative risk 
reduction in HHF, a 51% reduction in all-cause death, 
and a 46% reduction in the HHF or death composite, 
consistent with the effects previously reported in a 
randomized clinical trial of empagliflozin.
• Approximately 87% of patients did not have 
known cardiovascular disease, suggesting possible 
cardiovascular benefits for a broad population of 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• The lower rates of HHF and death associated with 
SGLT-2i treatment are likely class related, as there 
was no significant heterogeneity across countries, 
despite geographic variations in the use of specific 
SGLT-2i (≈76% canagliflozin in the United States 
and ≈92% dapagliflozin in Europe).

of an SGLT-2i or a new oGLD in each of the countries (start 
date ranged from November 2012 in the United Kingdom to 
July 2013 in Sweden). New users were defined as individuals 
prescribed/filling a prescription (as initial or add-on therapy) 
for any SGLT-2i (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin) 
or oGLD (any other oral or injectable medication), including 
fixed-dose combinations, with no issued prescriptions of that 
medicine class during the preceding year (in Germany, with no 
prior documentation in the medical record of using that medi-
cine class within the previous 6 months). Additional inclusion 
criteria were age ≥18 years on the index date (defined as the 
prescription date for new SGLT-2i or new oGLD), and >1 year 
data history in the database before the index date. Patients 
with type 1 or gestational diabetes were excluded. Patients 
were followed from the index date until the end of the index 
treatment (for the on-treatment analysis), migration/leaving 
the practice/database, last date of data collection, outcome 
date, or censoring date (range from September 2015 in the 
United States to November 2016 in Sweden).
Outcomes
Primary outcome was HHF assessed in all countries. In the 
United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, HHF was 
defined as hospital admissions for heart failure (defined using 
primary discharge diagnosis codes in the United States,18 pri-
mary discharge diagnosis codes and documentation from the 
electronic health records in the United Kingdom, as defined in 
the online-only Data Supplement Appendix, and documenta-
tion in the electronic health records in Germany). In the Nordic 
countries (Sweden, Norway, and Denmark), HHF was defined 
by any hospital visit, in- or outpatient (ie, prognostically equiv-
alent outpatient heart failure [HF] event),19 with a registered 
primary diagnosis of HF (defined using diagnosis codes for 
HF events as detailed in the online-only Data Supplement 
Appendix, and validated independently in all 3 countries).20–22 
Secondary outcomes included all-cause death, and a compos-
ite of HHF or all-cause death (time-to-first-event), evaluated in 
all countries, except Germany. In the United States, all-cause 
death was identified by using the MarketScan Mortality File 
in which information from the Social Security Administration 
is integrated with the insurance enrollment and claims data, 
supplemented by claims for in-hospital deaths, covering 
≈61% of the overall US-based propensity-matched patient 
cohort. Characteristics of US patients with and without vital 
status were similar (online-only Data Supplement Table III), 
indicating data missing completely at random because of 
administrative reasons.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics of patients in the SGLT-2i and 
oGLD groups were analyzed by using descriptive statistics. 
Categorical variables were described by frequencies and per-
centages, and continuous variables by using mean (± SD). For 
continuous variables such as age, the overall mean across all 
databases was a summary estimate of country-specific means, 
weighted according to the number of patients in each respec-
tive database.
For the SGLT-2i group, the percentage of individual agents 
and their respective contributions to the overall SGLT-2i 
exposure time, and for the oGLD group, the percentage of 
individual drug classes, were summarized by country/geo-
graphic region and overall.
A nonparsimonious propensity score was developed (sepa-
rately within each country) for being initiated on an SGLT-2i 
to minimize confounding. Variables that may have affected 
treatment assignment or outcomes were included in the pro-
pensity score (online-only Data Supplement Table IV).23 Based 
on propensity scores, patients receiving SGLT-2i were matched 
1:1 with those receiving oGLDs. Nearest-neighbor caliper 
width of 0.25 multiplied by the SD of the propensity score 
distribution was used for the matching.23 In Sweden, Norway, 
and Denmark, an automated balance optimization method 
using the function Match (in package Matching) in R and a 
caliper of 0.2 were used for matching. The adequacy of pro-
pensity matching was assessed by standardized differences of 
postmatch patient characteristics. A significant imbalance was 
considered to be present if a >10% standardized difference 
was present between the 2 groups after propensity match.24
Incidence analyses of HHF, death, and composite of HHF 
or death were conducted by treatment group. Only the first 
episode of each outcome was included, and the crude inci-
dence rate (IR) in each group was calculated as the number of 
incident events divided by the total number of person-years 
at risk, and expressed per 100 person-years with 95% con-
fidence interval (CI). Times to first event for the SGLT-2i and 
oGLD groups were compared using Cox proportional hazards 
models and presented as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI for 
each outcome separately within each country.
The primary analysis used an on-treatment approach where 
patients were followed from the start of an index treatment 
and censored at the end of that treatment plus a grace period 
(duration of last issued prescription).
The HRs (95% CI) for each of the end points from each 
individual country were then pooled together for an overall 
weighted summary,25 in which random-effects models with 
inverse variance weighting for each country were imple-
mented.26 Forest plots displaying the country-specific HRs 
(95% CI) along with the pooled overall HR (95% CI) were 
produced.
Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted: first, the HR 
(95% CI) within each country, and for each outcome, were 
examined after adjusting the crude propensity-matched esti-
mates for multiple covariates that may have confounded the 
relationship between treatment and outcome. The adjusted 
HRs (95% CIs) from each country were pooled and meta-ana-
lyzed using the same method as described above. Second, the 
analyses for each outcome were repeated using intent-to-treat 
analysis, in which patients were followed after discontinua-
tion of index treatment.27–29 Third, the analyses for HHF were 
repeated after stepwise removal of specific oGLD classes from 
the comparator group, to examine whether a specific oGLD 
class contributed disproportionately to the results. Stepwise 
elimination was performed in the following sequence: thia-
zolidinediones, thiazolidinediones+insulin, thiazolidinediones
+insulin+sulfonylureas. Fourth, HHF analyses were repeated 
after excluding patients treated with glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor agonist at baseline from SGLT-2i and oGLD groups. 
Fifth, primary analyses were repeated separately in the United 
States and Europe. Finally, the association between treat-
ment with SGLT-2i and oGLD was reexamined separately for 
patients that had both in- and outpatient hospital visits for

HF, and those that had only inpatient hospital visits for HF in 
Sweden (because these could not be separated in Norway 
and Denmark; and only inpatient HF visits were analyzed in 
other countries).
For power calculations, see the online-only Data 
Supplement Appendix. Because of the deidentified nature of 
patient records, informed consent was not obtained. Analyses 
of deidentified data were conducted in accordance with local 
laws and regulations, and received approvals from respec-
tive Scientific/Ethics/Data Protection Committees. Country-
specific analyses were conducted by independent academic/
statistical groups. The meta-analyses were conducted by 
Statisticon, and validated by the independent academic stat-
isticians at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute.
RESULTS
Study Population
A total of 1 
392 
254 new SGLT-2i or oGLD users were 
identified; 166 
033 SGLT-2i, and 1 
226 
221 oGLD overall 
and by country (Figure 1 and online-only Data Supple-
ment Figure I). Before propensity match (online-only 
Data Supplement Table V) patients initiated on SGLT-2i 
were younger, less likely to have chronic kidney disease 
or cardiovascular complications, but more likely to have 
microvascular disease. Greater proportions of patients 
initiated on SGLT-2i versus oGLD received statins and 
antihypertensive drugs, and lower proportions received 
loop diuretics. Patients on SGLT-2i were more likely to 
be treated with other glucose-lowering medication 
classes at baseline. The overlap in propensity scores be-
tween groups before and after the propensity match is 
shown in online-only Data Supplement Figures II and III.
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between 
groups postmatching overall and by country (Table and 
online-only Data Supplement Table VI), with standard-
ized differences for most variables being <10% (online-
only Data Supplement Figure IV). Pre- and postmatch 
standardized differences are shown in online-only Data 
Supplement Table VII. Mean age was 57 years, 44%

A large number of patients were excluded from the other 
GLD group because of the protocol mandated 1:1 match, 
and given the smaller number of patients in the SGLT-2i 
group. GLD indicates glucose-lowering drug; and SGLT-2i, 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor.

were women, and 13% had established CVD. Overall, 
67% of patients received statins, 80% antihypertensive 
medications, 74% with angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, and 79% 
metformin.
The composition of SGLT-2i agents is shown in on-
line-only Data Supplement Table VIII, and the compo-
sition of the index medications in the oGLD group is 
shown in online-only Data Supplement Tables IX and 
X. The composition of SGLT-2i agents in terms of total 
exposure time was balanced between canagliflozin and 
dapagliflozin, with <7% total exposure attributable to 
empagliflozin for all outcomes (Figure 2).
SGLT-2i and HHF
A total of 309 
056 patients (154 
528 in each group) 
were identified after propensity matching. Cana-
gliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin accounted 
for 53%, 42%, and 5% of the total exposure time in 
the SGLT-2i class, respectively (Figure 2A through 2C).
Over 190 
164 person-years follow-up, there were 961 
HHF events (IR, 0.51/100 person-years; online-only Data 
Supplement Table XI; IR by treatment group in online-only 
Data Supplement Table XII). Mean duration of follow-up 
for HHF was 239 days in the SGLT-2i group and 211 days in 
the oGLD group (online-only Data Supplement Table XIII). 
Initiation of SGLT-2i versus oGLD was associated with a 
lower risk of HHF (pooled HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51–0.73; 
 
P<0.001; Figure 3A). HRs favored SGLT-2i in each country 
(P value for heterogeneity 0.17).
SGLT-2i and All-Cause Death
A total of 215 
622 patients (107 
811 in each group) 
were identified. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empa-
gliflozin accounted for 42%, 51%, and 7% of SGLT-2i 
 
exposure time, respectively (Figure 2A through 2C).
Over 153 990 person-years of follow-up, there 
were 1334 events (IR, 0.87/100 person-years; online-
only Data Supplement Table XI; IR by treatment group 
in online-only Data Supplement Table XII). Mean 
duration of follow-up was 271 days in the SGLT-2i 
group and 251 days in the oGLD group (online-only 
Data Supplement Table XIII). Initiation of SGLT-2i ver-
sus oGLD was associated with a lower risk of death 
(pooled HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.41–0.57; P<0.001; Fig-
ure 4A). HRs favored SGLT-2i in each country (P value 
for heterogeneity 0.09).
SGLT-2i and Composite Outcome of HHF 
or Death
For the composite outcome, the number of patients was 
identical to the all-cause death analysis. Canagliflozin, 
dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin accounted for 45%, 
49%, and 6% of SGLT-2i exposure time, respectively 
(Figure 2A through 2C).
Over 143 
342 person-years of follow-up, there were

only Data Supplement Table XII). Mean duration of fol-
low-up was 253 days in the SGLT-2i group and from 233 
days in the oGLD group (online-only Data Supplement 
Table XIII). Initiation of SGLT-2i versus oGLD was associ-
ated with a lower risk of HHF or death (pooled HR, 0.54; 
95% CI, 0.48–0.60; P<0.001; Figure 4D). HRs favored 
SGLT-2i in each country (P value for heterogeneity 0.17).
Sensitivity Analyses
For all 3 outcomes, similar results were found after mul-
tivariate adjustment (Figures 3B, 4B, and 4E), using an 
intent-to-treat approach (Figures 3C, 4C, and 4F) and 
stepwise removal of specific oGLD classes (online-only 
Data Supplement Figures V and VI). Comparisons with-
in geographic regions yielded similar results (online-only 
Data Supplement Figure VII). The association between 
treatment with SGLT-2i versus oGLD and lower risk of 
HHF was consistent among patients that had both in- 
and outpatient hospital visits for HF, and those who had 
only inpatient hospital visits for HF in Sweden (online-
only Data Supplement Table XIV).
DISCUSSION
In this large contemporary analysis of real-world clinical 
practice across 6 countries, within a well-matched sam-
ple of >300 
000 patients with T2D and nearly 200 
000 
patient-years of observation, initiation of SGLT-2i versus 
oGLDs was associated with a 39% lower incidence of 
HHF. Since the overwhelming majority of patients did 
not have established CVD, this suggests that the ben-
efits of SGLT-2i on the prevention of HF may extend to 
lower-risk patients than those enrolled in randomized 
trials so far. These findings were unchanged after ad-
ditional multivariable adjustment, and in multiple sensi-
tivity analyses. Specifically, the results were unchanged 
after sequential removal of several oGLD classes from 
the comparator group, suggesting that the differential 
outcomes observed are unlikely to reflect adverse ef-
fects of comparator drugs, but are rather associated 
with benefit from SGLT-2i. Furthermore, results were 
consistent across countries, regardless of variability in 
healthcare systems and use of specific SGLT-2i (predom-
inantly canagliflozin in the United States; dapagliflozin

in Europe), suggesting an association with the class 
rather than any single agent. Importantly, initiation of 
SGLT-2i versus oGLDs was also associated with a 51% 
lower rate of all-cause death, and a 46% lower rate of 
the combined end point of HHF or all-cause death.
Although intensive glucose lowering has, in random-
ized trials, failed to reduce what are arguably some of 
the most important outcomes in patients with T2D (all-
cause death and incident HF), results from the EMPA-
REG OUTCOME trial demonstrated that such benefits 
are achievable within a short time frame with an SGLT-
2i, likely via nonglycemic mechanisms. Ultimately, the 
main goals of treating patients with T2D are to prolong 
life and improve quality of life. Given that CVD (includ-
ing HF) is a leading cause of mortality/morbidity in T2D, 
the results of the recent cardiovascular outcomes trials 
suggest that the time has come to shift from the nar-
row focus on hemoglobin A1c to a more comprehen-
sive focus in which treatments proven to improve im-
portant outcomes (especially mortality) are prioritized.
Our findings address several key unanswered ques-
tions with regard to the potential role of SGLT-2i in the 
management of T2D, with important clinical implica-
tions. First, our results demonstrate that the effects as-
sociated with the use of SGLT-2i in regard to HHF and 
all-cause death are remarkably similar in real-world 
practice to those seen in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
trial. Second, we found no significant heterogeneity in 
results across countries, despite geographic variations 
in the use of specific SGLT-2i, suggesting that the asso-
ciated lower risks for cardiovascular outcomes are likely 
class related. Indeed, for all outcomes evaluated, empa-
gliflozin contributed <7% of total exposure time. Third, 
we evaluated a broader cardiovascular risk population 
in general practice, where the overwhelming majority 
(87%) had no established CVD, suggesting that lower-
risk patients may derive benefits with SGLT-2i similar to 
the patients with higher risk. If confirmed by data from 
ongoing trials (CANVAS30 [Canagliflozin Cardiovascular 
Assessment Study; NCT01032629]; DECLARE [Multi-
center Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on 
the Incidence of Cardiovascular Events; NCT01730534]; 
and VERTIS [Cardiovascular Outcomes Following Ertugli-
flozin Treatment in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Participants 
With Vascular Disease, The VERTIS CV Study {MK-8835-
004}; NCT01986881]), this would have substantial im-
pact on clinical practice. In this regard, we see the data 
produced from carefully conducted, methodologically 
rigorous, large multicountry epidemiological studies, 
as complementary to those generated by clinical trials, 
 
as they help establish the real-world effectiveness of 
 
treatments in a broad population of patients from clini-
cal practice. Indeed, the importance of such studies 
for a broad range of objectives, including evaluation 
of treatment effects and outcomes, and their potential 
for complementing the knowledge gained from clinical 
trials, is being increasingly recognized,31 and the ter-
minology describing these as real-world evidence has 
recently been accepted by major international regula-
tory bodies.32–34
To our knowledge, CVD-REAL is the first large study 
addressing the real-world effectiveness (rather than 
efficacy) of SGLT-2i on specific outcomes of HHF and 
all-cause death across multiple countries. Given that 
SGLT-2i is a novel class, real-world experience is limited. 
Single-country data were previously reported with a 
specific SGLT-2i (dapagliflozin) in Sweden; however, that 
study was limited by the smaller number of patients, 
and focused on different outcomes (hypoglycemia and 
composite of CVD).35 The size of our sample and our 
ability to pool data from diverse sources allowed us to 
collect a large number of events, and examine the sta-
bility of results across various cardiovascular outcomes, 
multiple countries (with variable use of specific SGLT-2i), 
and perform numerous sensitivity analyses.
Our findings should be examined within the context 
of several potential limitations. First, given the observa-
tional nature of the study, and despite robust propen-
sity-matching and multiple sensitivity analyses, a pos-
sibility of residual, unmeasured confounding, cannot 
be excluded. Second, we focused on HHF and all-cause 
death, and did not examine other events, such as myo-
cardial infarction and stroke. However, HF is arguably 
the most lethal T2D complication9,36 and is associated 
with particularly poor survival.11 Third, we did not ex-
amine safety. Fourth, despite a large number of patient-
years of follow up, SGLT-2i experience in real-world 
practice is still relatively limited; longer-term follow-up 
will be required to examine if effects are sustained over 
time. Fifth, there were differences in the definitions of

HHF across countries; however, the results were con-
sistent across countries and in sensitivity analyses spe-
cifically performed to examine these differences. Finally, 
our study did not address the mechanisms linking the 
use of SGLT-2i and associated cardiovascular benefits. 
However, this knowledge gap is being examined by 
mechanistic investigations across the class.37–39
CONCLUSION
In this large multinational study, treatment with SGLT-2i 
versus oGLDs was associated with lower rates of HHF 
and death, suggesting that the benefits previously re-
ported with empagliflozin in the context of a random-
ized trial may be applicable to a broad population of 
patients with T2D in real-world practice. The lack of 
heterogeneity in results across countries, despite geo-
graphic variations in the use of specific SGLT-2i, sug-
gests a class effect for SGLT-2i.
