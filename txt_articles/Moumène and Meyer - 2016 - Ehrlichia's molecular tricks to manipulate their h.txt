Abstract
Ehrlichia is a large genus of obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacteria transmitted by ticks that cause several emerging infectious diseases
in humans and are pathogenic on rodents, ruminants, and dogs. Ehrlichia spp. invade and replicate either in endothelial cells, white blood cells,
or within midgut cells and salivary glands of their vector ticks. In this review, we discuss the insights that functional studies are providing on how
this group of bacteria exploits their host by subverting host innate immunity and hijacking cellular processes.

1. Introduction
Obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens of the species
Ehrlichia belonging to the Anaplasmataceae family in the
order Rickttesiales parasitize a wide variety of mammalian
reservoir hosts and are responsible for several emerging
human infectious diseases [1]. Examples include human
monocytic ehrlichiosis, and Ehrlichia ewingii ehrlichiosis
caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and E. ewingii respectively
[2]. Reported primarily as veterinary pathogens, Ehrlichia
canis and Ehrlichia ruminantium have also been documented
in humans [3,4]. Infections with Ehrlichia spp. are responsible
for a wide range of symptoms that can include fever, head-
ache, myalgias and malaise. Other manifestations such as
thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and anemia can occur [5].
These bacteria display the particularity of being able to
replicate within two hosts, a mammalian host and a tick vector,
and of orchestrating highly sophisticated and complex strate-
gies to persist and then infect their natural hosts [6]. They
provide a wealth of information about bacterial adaptation to
various environments. Some species are associated with
diverse host reservoirs, for example deers are considered
important reservoir hosts of E. chaffeensis (Fig. 1) [7].
Transmission of these bacteria occurs through the bite of
infected ticks [6]. All Anaplasmataceae share a similar
biphasic developmental cycle involving two morphologically
distinct forms (Figs. 2 and 3) [8]. First, the infectious extra-
cellular forms (elementary bodies, EB, or dense cored cells,
DC) attach to the surface of host target cells before entering by
endocytosis (Fig. 2A and B). Inside the host cells, the bacteria
develop within a membrane-bound vacuole where they create
a niche for survival and replication. They differentiate into
reticulate bodies (RB, or reticulate cells, RC) that divide by
binary fission to form a large colony, called morula (Fig. 2C).
After a few days, the bacteria redifferentiate into elementary
bodies to be released outside the cell and to initiate a new
infectious cycle (Fig. 2D) [2]. Ehrlichia and Anaplasma have
evolved diverse genomic features. Concerning genome size,
the complete genome of most representative species of these
genera have been sequenced and revealed small contracted
genomes with an average size of about 1.3 Mb and coding up
to about 1200 proteins (Fig. 1) [9e13].

 In this review, we highlight the more recent advances in
understanding the molecular mechanisms by which Ehrlichia
spp. manipulate host cells to facilitate intracellular growth and
spread infection, to gain full advantage of host cell properties
for their own benefit, and to evade host immune response.
2. Advances in functional genomics
Functional genomic approaches have fostered our under-
standing of the molecular pathogenesis of Anaplasmataceae,
despite
their
obligate
intracellular
nature.
Global
tran-
scriptomic studies became powerful tools that provided us
with a global view of pathogenic bacteria strategies in
response to stimuli. However, a major limitation in gene
expression analyses of obligate intracellular bacteria is the low
amount of prokaryotic material isolated from host cells and the
contamination with eukaryotic mRNA molecules. For E.
ruminantium-infected host cells, Emboul�
e et al. developed a
method called selective capture of transcribed sequences
(SCOTS) for the capture of bacterial mRNAs [14]. Using
SCOTS method, transcriptome analysis of E. ruminantium
revealed overexpressed genes potentially involved in patho-
genicity. In particular, a significant increase of expressed
genes related to metabolism, nutrient exchange, and defense
mechanisms was observed when bacteria are in the replicative
vacuole, suggesting that the bacterium may undergo oxidative
stress and nutrient starvation during early life cycle stages to
develop [15]. Global proteomic studies in Anaplasma phag-
ocytophilum and E. chaffeensis identified more than 1000
proteins for each species, giving a nice overview of bacterial
proteins expressed in infected human cells and of the patho-
genesis of these closely related obligate intracellular patho-
genic
bacteria
[16].
Indeed,
during
growth
in
human
leukocytes, important virulence factors, e.g., Type IV secretion
system (T4SS) apparatus, regulatory systems including a di-
versity of transcriptional regulators, two-component systems
were upregulated. Proteins required for central metabolism,
protein synthesis and cell envelop were also predominant. This
shows that Ehrlichia deploys a full arsenal of virulence pro-
teins to replicate and infect host cells. Moreover, those authors

 were able to define the host protein expression profiles regu-
lated by bacterial infection. A human proteome analysis sug-
gested
that
Ehrlichia
interferes
with
cellular
processes
including cytoskeleton rearrangement and intracellular traf-
ficking to manipulate host cell gene expression [16]. Very
recently, by combining bioinformatics predictions of protein
subcellular localizations and proteome analysis of outer
membrane fractions from E. ruminantium infectious elemen-
tary bodies, Moumene et al. identified 18 proteins very likely
to be OMPs [17]. Among these 18 proteins, some contributes
to cell membrane architecture (proteins of the BAM complex),
some are involved in the interaction between bacteria and host
cells (Map1 family proteins), and some are known to be
virulence factors (T4SS components). In addition, 6 proteins
are completely new OMPs and are therefore of importance as
potential vaccine antigens [17]. Rapid advances in genetic
manipulation of several members of the Anaplasmataceae
family have facilitated the identification and the character-
ization of certain virulence factors. A random mutagenesis
strategy using the Himar1 system was successfully tested on
E. chaffeensis [18]. Such an approach requires selecting
appropriate antibiotics, constructing plasmid vectors, and
optimizing bacterial transformation methods. The authors
observed
that
mutations
in
certain
hypothetical
genes,
including Ech_0660, inhibited infection and growth in deer, a
natural reservoir of E. chaffeensis, identifying possible genes
that may be important in the virulence of this organism [18].
This result showed, for the first time in E. chaffeensis, a
connection between a mutation and its potential role during
infection. Very recently, Nair et al. (2015) have also conducted
a transposon mutagenesis within the genes Ech_0379 and
Ech_0660 confering attenuation in E. chaffeensis. These
attenuated mutants have been shown to reduce or eliminate the
bacteria in animals and confer protection against wild-type
infection challenge [19]. Taken together, these findings are
promising for the development of vaccines against this path-
ogenic bacterium. In addition to lead to an attenuated growth
in deer, the mutations within these genes and another one
(Ech_0230) enhance or reduce gene expression of genes near
the
insertion
sites.
Interestingly,
the
attenuated
growth
phenotype was also observed in dogs (incendital host) but not
in the tick vector. This study shed light on differential regu-
lation of virulence factors essential for Ehrlichia pathogenesis
[20]. The genetic manipulation of Ehrlichia will serve to

 define important genes for pathogenesis studies, to verify the
functions of candidate virulence factor genes, and to open the
way for other related emerging zoonotic pathogens.
Finally, the development of axenic growth, successful in
Coxiella burnetii and Chlamydia trachomatis, should facilitate
genetic analyses of these fascinating obligate intracellular
pathogens and may lead to the development of vaccine against
Ehrlichia diseases [21,22]. Indeed, Martinez et al. isolated
3000 Coxiella mutants and revealed a variety of bacterial
factors involved in Coxiella infection [23]. The transposon
mutagenesis screen revealed that mutation of 17 Dot/Icm ef-
fectors perturbs the replication of Coxiella, suggesting their
importance for intracellular growth [23].
3. Ehrlichia subversion of host cell responses
Ehrlichia have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to invade
and multiply in host tissues. Host recognition and elimination of
invading pathogens are essential for the control of bacterial in-
fections. However, Anaplasmataceae have developed strategies
to subvert host cell processes ranging from host signaling,
modulation of vesicular traffic, protection from oxidative burst,
acquisition of nutrients, and control of innate immune activation.
3.1. Adhesion and invasion mechanisms
Anaplasmataceae family pathogens deploy a wide range of
proteins, including adhesin and invasin, for entry into host
cells. Adhesion and entry of E. chaffeensis into mammalian
cells proceed via the invasin EtpE. This protein was found to
be upregulated in DC and the authors observed that mono-
clonal antibodies raised against EtpE inhibited entry into the
host cell, supporting the idea that EtpE may be the appropriate
surface protein for adhesion. This outer membrane protein
binds to glycosylphosphotidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein
DNase X within caveoli at the monocyte cell surface that
signal host cytoskeletal rearrangement and filopodium for-
mation promoting bacterial uptake (Fig. 3). Interestingly, im-
munization with EtpE has been shown to induce protection in
infected mice making EtpE promising vaccine candidate [24].
After internalization, E. chaffeensis is contained in vacuoles
that develop into early endosomes. They retain several hall-
marks such as the early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) and
Rab5A protein, both of which are regulators of vesicular
trafficking; the transferrin receptors (TfR) which accumulate
during the development of early inclusions and contribute to
acquire iron from host cells; and the vacuolar-type Hþ ATPase
[25,26]. Morever, the interaction between TRP47 and CAP1
participates in vesicle and endocytic trafficking that promotes
E. chaffeensis infection. A recent study of the protein
composition of ehrlichial vacuole revealed that E. chaffeensis
vacuole exhibits a late endosome characteristic, protein Rab7
and is acidified at pH 5.2 in DH82 cells. This acidification may
be necessary for intracellular survival and replication. Thus, E.
chaffeensis is able to change its vacuolar membrane for effi-
cient development. This process aims to escape fusion with
lysosomes (Fig. 3) [27].
3.2. Manipulation of apoptosis
Ehrlichia spp. have evolved a myriad of virulence factors to
evade host innate defenses, including apoptosis, to take
advantage of the host cells. For instance, E. ewingii can inhibit
spontaneous apoptosis in host canine neutrophils in vivo by
stabilizing
the
mitochondrial
membrane
[28].
Ehrlichia
morulae
interact
with
mitochondria
to
deliver
proteins
permitting inhibition of mitochondrial activities [29]. More-
over, the type I secretion system substrates Ank200, TRP32,
TRP120, and TRP47 play important roles in trafficking,
apoptosis and signal transduction during Ehrlichia infection
(Fig. 3) [30,31]. In particular, TRP47 interacts with CAP1,
resulting in inhibition of apoptosis. These TRPs proteins are
translocated into the host cell nucleus where they may modify
host cell signaling pathways to escape the innate immunity
mechanisms [32]. They are differently expressed during the
developmental cycle of the bacterium. The expression of
TRP32 and TRP75 is constitutive in DC and RC whereas
TRP47 and TR120 are expressed only at the late stages of
infection [33]. Interestingly, TRP orthologs p120/p140 of E.
chaffeensis and E. canis elicit strong antibody responses,
providing insight into the protective immune responses against
these bacteria [34]. In addition, E. chaffeensis T4SS is used to
inject bacterial effector protein into host mitochondria. Using
bacterial two-hybrid screening, H. Liu et al. identified the first
Ehrlichia effector, ECH0825. It is up-regulated in human
monocytes during early infection when the intracellular acti-
vation of virB expression occurred. This effector is involved in
the inhibition of apoptosis associated with intracellular
infection (Fig. 3) [35].
3.3. Protection from oxidative stress and inhibition of
immune responses
Ehrlichia is highly sensitive to reactive oxygen species and
actively suppresses O�
2 production by T4E ECH0825 [35]. By
upregulating a mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, ECH0825
seems to prevent ROS-induced cellular damage and apoptosis,
allowing intracellular infection. In addition, Ehrlichia is able
to perturb the JAK/STAT signaling pathway that have an
essential role in a cytokine signaling and thus may be able to
inhibit activation of macrophages by interferons and in-
terleukins [36]. Moreover, during infection, E. chaffeensis
circumvent immune responses by directly inhibiting tran-
scription of cytokines involved in early immune response and
cell-mediated immune response to intracellular bacteria such
as IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18. These cytokines play a funda-
mental role in stimulating TH1 and NK cells to produce IFN-g,
which then activates macrophages [37,38]. Thus, such sup-
pression of cytokine production avoids intracellular killing of
Ehrlichia by macrophages. Very recently, it was shown that
Ehrlichia induced strong pro-inflammatory responses with the
activation of inflammasomes involved in the cleavage of
caspase-1, which in turn promotes the production of IL-1b, IL-
1a, and type I interferon (IFN-I) leading to fatal ehrlichiosis
[39]. The authors observed that resistance of knockout mice in
176
A. Moum�
ene, D.F. Meyer / Microbes and Infection 18 (2016) 172e179
 interferon receptor 1 (IFNAR1) to fatal infection was signifi-
cantly higher than in wild-type mice. This finding is surprising
because this inflammasome pathway is normally engaged
against bacterial infection. The activation of IFN-I contributes
to abolish the protective immunity by inhibiting induction of
CD4(þ) T and T-cell cytokines [39].
3.4. Manipulation of host cell signaling
A functional type IV secretion system (T4SS) and the related
secretion of effectors play an important role in key steps of
Ehrlichia infections. This macromolecular complex, encoded by
virBD genes, serves to deliver substrates into the eukaryotic cells
to promote invasion and pathogenesis of bacteria [40]. The first
analysis of regulation of virBD genes expression in Ehrlichia
revealed that this system is under the control of a transcriptional
factor, EcxR, that regulates the activation of T4SS components
during intracellular infection of the host cells [41]. Many other
transcriptional regulators or environmental stimuli controlling
expression of the VirBD system remain to be discovered, like the
eclectic repertoire of transcription factors defined in Brucella
[42e44]. Meyer et al. developed a bioinformatics algorithm for
the prediction of T4SS effector proteins from the genomes of
alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria [45]. This powerful tool will
help in discovering new effectors involved in bacterial patho-
genesis. Also, E. chaffeensis exploits host post-translational
modification (PTM), SUMOylation to promote their intracel-
lular survival (Fig. 3). During Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection, the
type I secretion system effector TRP120 is SUMOylated on
lysine residues that mediate interactions with host protein targets
such as actin and myosin cytoskeleton component (Myo10) or
GGA1
involved
in
vesicular
trafficking
[46].
TRP120
SUMOylation may control the interaction between the effector
and host factors critical for the infection process. In host cells,
this protein colocalizes with SUMO2/3 at the vacuole and in the
cytosol and enhances recruitment of host proteins. Thus, Ehrli-
chia manipulates this PTM pathway as virulence mechanism to
usurp host cell and establish its intracellular niche [46].
3.5. Exit mechanisms and spreading
The mechanisms underlying the release of Ehrlichia from
cells are now better understood. At early stages of infection,
Ehrlichia traffics between cells by the mean of actin-
containing filopodia. These cellular protusions permit Ehrli-
chia to exit the infected cell and enter neighboring uninfected
cells without entering the extracellular space and thus allow
evasion of the host's immune system. Inhibition of filopodia
formation by cytochalasin D prevents ehrlichial transport but
the bacterium is then released by host cell membrane rupture
adjacent to the morula during later stages of infection [47].
Similarly, inhibitory compounds affecting cytoskeleton rear-
rangement, protein kinases, calcium channels, or iron signifi-
cantly reduce the number of E. canis in infected cells,
indicating that these cellular processes are important for the
proliferation of E. canis [48]. Alves et al. assessed the effect of
several similar inhibitory drugs on spreading of E. canis in
macrophages [49]. They showed that various host physiolog-
ical processes like actin polymerization in the cytoskeleton
and calcium and iron influx are required for full bacteremia
and spreading in mammalian cells. They also showed that acid
phosphatase, used to label lysosomes, rarely marked the in-
clusions of E. canis, suggesting that it escapes fusion with
lysosome. Finally, TRP47 and TRP120 described above
interact with host cytoskeletal proteins and with accessory
proteins such as the ARP2/3 complex and CAP1 to facilitate
exocytosis or filopodium formation [50].
4. Concluding statements
Considerable progress has been made in understanding the
pathogenesis of Ehrlichia infection. Despite their obligate
intracellular lifestyle, huge advances have been made in ge-
netic manipulation of these bacteria. The recent development
of targeted and random mutagenesis strategies, coupled with
the tremendous evolution of sequencing technologies, omics
approaches, and in vivo imaging, offers new perspectives for
the molecular dissection of the unique lifestyles of these
bacteria and the virulence factors involved in their pathogen-
esis. Although advances have been made in deciphering gene
regulation of the intracellular growth and maturation of Ehr-
lichia, many regulatory pathways still need to be discovered.
Moreover, questions remain on the ecology of these bacteria
(e.g. life inside the vector).
The determinants of host-specificity are largely unexplored
but they promise insightful knowledge on the biology of Ana-
plasmataceae and the adaptation to their host. Host-specificity is
a fundamental concept that describes the nature of host-microbe
associations, and most frequently gains attention for its impact
on our understanding of pathogen virulence potential, zoonoses,
and emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Thus, iden-
tifying key effector proteins involved in host-specificity, and
more specifically in host-switching, could lead to the develop-
ment of alternative therapeutic strategies to prevent future out-
breaks
of
infectious
diseases.
Moreover,
dissecting
the
repertoire of type IV effector proteins of Ehrlichia offers the
unique possibility to genetically identify components of innate
immunity. A full understanding of the molecular and genetic
mechanisms by which Ehrlichia virulence factors induce dif-
ferential regulation of host innate responses is thus of utmost
importance. Testing the idea stating that bacterial virulence
proteins may exploit host-signaling pathways to destabilize host
innate response at early steps of infection could highlight some
elegant examples of ultimate bacterial adaptation to their hosts.
