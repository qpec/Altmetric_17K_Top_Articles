and Individuals With Diabetes:
A Randomized Clinical Trial
Diabetes Care 2017;40:1573–1579 | https://doi.org/10.2337/dc16-2753
OBJECTIVE
The circadian clock regulates glucose metabolism by mediating the activity of met-
abolic enzymes, hormones, and transport systems. Breakfast skipping and night
eating have been associated with high HbA1c and postprandial hyperglycemia after
lunch and dinner. Our aim was to explore the acute effect of breakfast consumption
or omission on glucose homeostasis and clock gene expression in healthy individuals
and individuals with type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
In a crossover design, 18 healthy volunteers and 18 volunteers with 14.5 6 1.5 years
diabetes, BMI 30.7 6 1.1 kg/m2, and HbA1c 7.6 6 0.1% (59.6 6 0.8 mmol/mol) were
randomly assigned to a test day with breakfast and lunch (YesB) and a test day with
only lunch (NoB). Postprandial clock and clock-controlled gene expression, plasma
glucose, insulin, intact glucagon-like peptide 1 (iGLP-1), and dipeptidyl peptidase IV
(DPP-IV) plasma activity were assessed after breakfast and lunch.
RESULTS
In healthy individuals, the expression level of Per1, Cry1, Rora, and Sirt1 was lower
(P < 0.05) but Clock was higher (P < 0.05) after breakfast. In contrast, in individuals
with type 2 diabetes, Per1, Per2, and Sirt1 only slightly, but significantly, decreased
and Rora increased (P < 0.05) after breakfast. In healthy individuals, the expression
level of Bmal1, Rora, and Sirt1 was higher (P < 0.05) after lunch on YesB day, whereas
the other clock genes remained unchanged. In individuals with type 2 diabetes,
Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Rev-erba, and Ampk increased (P < 0.05) after lunch on the YesB
day. Omission of breakfast altered clock and metabolic gene expression in both
healthy and individuals with type 2 diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS
Breakfast consumption acutely affects clock and clock-controlled gene expression
leading to normal oscillation. Breakfast skipping adversely affects clock and clock-
controlled gene expression and is correlated with increased postprandial glycemic
response in both healthy individuals and individuals with diabetes.

CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC RISK
 The circadian clock controls the activity of
most enzymes, hormones, and transport
systems involved in glucose metabolism
(1,2). The central circadian clock, located
in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the ante-
rior hypothalamus, generates endoge-
nous ;24-h rhythms. Similar clocks are
found in peripheral tissues, such as the
liver, b-cells, muscle, and adipose tissue
(3–5). The core clock mechanism in the
brain and peripheral tissues comprises
two loops. The positive loop consists of
the CLOCK and BMAL1 heterodimer that
mediates transcription of tissue-specific
genes and those of the negative feedback
loop. The negative feedback loop consists
of the period (PER) and cryptochrome
(CRY) proteins that inhibit CLOCK:BMAL1-
mediated transcription (6).
Unlike thesuprachiasmatic nucleiclock,
which responds mainly to the light-dark
cycle, peripheral clocks respond to meal
content and timing, leading to coordi-
nated regulation of digestive and absorp-
tive functions and hormone secretion,
thereby preventing metabolic dysregulation
(1–4). CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer plays a
critical role in mediating the transcription
of coactivators that regulate the circadian
synthesis ofmost ofthe enzymesandhor-
mones involved in glucose homeostasis,
i.e., regulation of hepatic gluconeogene-
sis and pancreatic b-cell insulin secretion
(7). CRY proteins inhibit gluconeogenic
gene expression by regulating CREBP ac-
tivity and their hepatic depletion in-
creases circulating glucose, and CRY
overexpression reduces fasting blood glu-
coseandimproveswhole-bodyinsulinsen-
sitivity in obese mice (7). CLOCK:BMAL1
heterodimer regulates the expression of
Rev-erba and Rora (8–10). REV-ERBa, the
negative regulator of Bmal1 expression
(8), is induced during normal adipogenesis
and mediates a suppressive effect on he-
patic gluconeogenesis and glucose output
by regulating the expression of PEPCK
and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pase).
Depletion of REV-ERBa leads to hyper-
glycemia(2,7).Incontrast,RORa, the pos-
itive regulator of Bmal1 expression (10),
activates the hepatic gluconeogenic en-
zyme G6pase and regulates lipogenesis
and lipid storage in skeletal muscle (2,10).
AMPK, the cellular energy sensor, also
plays a key role in the clock mechanism by
enhancing degradation of PER and CRY pro-
teins (11). Upregulation of AMPK signaling
significantlyenhances GLUT4 translocation
and muscular glucose uptake, ensuring
metabolic efficiency and improving post-
prandial glucose and insulin responses
(12). AMPK exerts a positive effect on
SIRT1, associated with beneficial effects
on b-cell viability and insulin sensitivity,
which interacts directly with CLOCK and
deacetylates BMAL1 and PER2 (12–15).
Reduced glucose-stimulated insulin se-
cretion, insulin resistance, diminished
b-cell proliferation, and apoptosis have
been associated with asynchrony or defi-
ciencies in clock genes (16). Moreover,
lower transcripts of Bmal1 and Cry2 are
inversely correlated with HbA1c levels
(17,18). Furthermore, higher risk of obe-
sity, metabolic alterations, and type 2 di-
abetes have been found in shift workers
and individuals who underwent acute or
chronic forced circadian misalignment
(19,20), supporting the notion that the
clock plays an essential role in the preser-
vation of insulin sensitivity and b-cell
function.
It has recently been found that secre-
tion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a
key incretin hormone that regulates glu-
cose-dependent insulin secretion from in-
testinal L cells, shows a rhythmic pattern
in rats and humans in vivo. In addition, its
secretion is altered by circadian disrup-
tors, such as constant light exposure, con-
sumption of a Western diet, and feeding
during the inactivity hours. The alter-
ations in the rhythm of GLP-1 secretory
response parallel changes in the pattern
of insulin responses (5). This would sug-
gest that it is important to preserve clock
functionality in subjects with type 2 dia-
betes. In fact, recent studies suggest that
breakfast skipping and night eating dis-
rupt circadian rhythms and, as a result,
impair glucose metabolism and b-cell
function (16,21,22).
We have recently shown that omission
of breakfast in patients with type 2 diabe-
tes ledtoincreasedpostprandial glycemia
and attenuated insulin and GLP-1 re-
sponses after lunch and dinner (23). Al-
though the mechanism underlying this
effect is unclear, we hypothesize that
breakfast consumption triggers proper
cyclic clock gene expression, leading to
improved postprandial glycemia and in-
sulin and GLP-1 responses. Since the
acute effect of meals and specifically
breakfast on clock gene expression is
not known in humans, we compared
clock and clock-controlled gene expres-
sion in association with glucose, insu-
lin, and GLP-1 responses and plasma
dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) activity
in healthy individuals and individuals
with type 2 diabetes consuming or skip-
ping breakfast.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Participants
This was a randomized, open-label,
crossover-within-subject clinical trial. The
study population included 18 subjects
with type 2 diabetes and 18 healthy sub-
jects. All participants habitually ate break-
fast, did not work shifts within the last
5 years, and did not cross time zones
within the last month prior to the study.
Participants usually woke up at 0600–
0700 h and went to sleep at 2200–2400 h.
None of the participants had impaired
thyroid, renal, or liver function; anemia;
pulmonary disease; psychiatric, immuno-
logical, or neoplastic diseases; or severe
diabetic complications or underwent bari-
atric surgery. All participants were insulin
na¨
ıve, and only patients taking metformin
were included. Patients taking oral hypo-
glycemic agents, such as GLP-1 analogs,
anorectic drugs, or steroids, were ex-
cluded. Those patients on metformin
were told to stop taking the medication
2 days before test days. All participants
gave their informed consent. The study
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov,
NCT01939782. The Helsinki Committee of
the Wolfson Medical Center, where the
trial was performed, approved the study.
Study Design
There were two groups of participants: a
group with type 2 diabetes and a group of
healthy control subjects. Both groups un-
derwent two separate test days in the
clinic, with two different experimental
conditions: 1) the participants ate break-
fast and lunch (YesB), or 2) the partici-
pants did not eat breakfast, i.e., continued
the overnight fast until lunchtime and then
had lunch (NoB). The two test days were
separated by 1–2 weeks of washout. A
person not involved in the study, using a
coin flip, randomized participants within
their group to start with the YesB or NoB
day. Participants ingested their last oral
therapy 18 h before the test days. The sub-
jects were instructed to eat a standardized
meal in the evening, between 2100 and
2200 h, prior to test day, consisting of
two white/wheat bread slices and an op-
tional drink, such as tea or coffee with an
artificial sweetener or diet soda. Eating a
standardizedmealthenightbeforethetest

 prevents long overnight fasting in the YesB
group and more so in the NoB group. Ad-
ditionally, participants were instructed to
avoid alcohol and excessive physical activ-
ity 6 days preceding each test day. On the
YesB day, participants had two identical
standard meals that were provided in the
clinic as breakfast at 0830 h and lunch at
1200 h. On the NoB day, breakfast was
omittedandtheindividualscontinuedtheir
overnight fast until lunch at 1200 h. The
energy and content of each test meal
were identical (572 6 8 kcal; 19.4% fat,
49% carbohydrates, and 32% protein).
The primary outcome was to compare
clock and clock-controlled gene expres-
sion (Clock, Bmal1, Per1, Per2, Cry1, Rev-
erba, Rora, Ampk, and Sirt1) in white
blood cells (WBCs) on YesB versus NoB
days in healthy individuals and individuals
with type 2 diabetes. Gene expression
profiling in the WBCs has been shown to
reflect food-related metabolic changes,
even in the postprandial state (24).
Gene expression was relative to actin, a
housekeeping gene, normalizing varia-
tions in WBC count. The secondary out-
come was to compare postprandial
plasma glucose, insulin, intact GLP-1
(iGLP-1), and DPP-IV plasma activity.
Meal Tests
On the day of the meal tests, each partic-
ipant reported to the laboratory at 0730 h
after an overnight fast. Anthropometric
data were collected in the morning. At
0800 h, a catheter was placed in the vein
of the nondominant arm and remained
there until 1530 h. Venous blood samples
for quantification of plasma glucose, insu-
lin,andiGLP-1werecollectedbeforebreak-
fast (at 0830 h), at 60 and 120 min after
breakfast, and at 210 min (at 1200 h, just
before lunch). After lunch (at 1200 h), sam-
ples were collected at 60, 120, and 210 min
(420 min including breakfast). On the NoB
day, blood sampleswere taken at the same
time points as on the YesB day. The sam-
ples for the assessment of clock and clock-
controlled gene expression and DPP-IV
activity were taken after the overnight fast
(at 0830 h), before lunch (at 1200 h), and
210 min after lunch (at 1530 h).
Biochemical and Hormonal Blood
Analyses
Plasma glucose was immediately analyzed
with hexokinase using a Cobas analyzer
(Roche Diagnostics, Madison, WI). Blood
samples for determining iGLP-1 were
collected into chilled tubes containing
EDTA and diprotin A (0.1 mmol/L). Samples
were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4°C
for 10 min and stored at 280°C. Insulin
was determined by electrochemilumines-
cence immunoassay using a Cobas ana-
lyzer (Roche Diagnostics) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. iGLP-1
was quantified using ELISA (IBL Amer-
ica, Minneapolis, MN). DPP-IV plasma
activity was analyzed as previously
described (25).
Analysis of Gene Expression in
Leukocytes
Blood for gene expression was collected
in Tempus tubes (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA), and total RNA was ex-
tractedaccording to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Total RNA was DNase I treat-
ed using RQ1 DNase (Promega, Madison,
WI) for 2 h at 37°C, as previously de-
scribed (26). Two micrograms of DNase
I–treatedRNAwasreversetranscribedusing
M-MuLVreverse transcriptase and random
hexamers (Promega). One-twentieth of
the reaction was then subjected to quan-
titative real-time PCR using primers
spanning exon-exon boundaries and
the ABI Prism 7300 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). The fold
change in target gene expression was
calculated by the 22DDCt relative quanti-
fication method (Applied Biosystems).
Sample Size and Power Analysis
Asamplesizeofn=16healthyparticipants
and n = 16 participants with type 2 di-
abetes in crossover was determined
to have .90% power to detect a true,
between-group difference of 40 6 25%
relative mRNA expression levels of clock
genes with a P value = 0.05. The current
study provided 80% power to detect 5%
difference between-group in overall post-
prandial plasma area under the curve

 (AUC) for iGLP-1, insulin, and glucose. To
allow discontinuation, 36 participants
were recruited.
Statistical Analysis
Thirty-six subjects were enrolled in the
study and four subjects dropped out.
They were excluded from the analyses;
therefore, the results are based on n = 32
subjects. AUC was calculated by the trap-
ezoidal rule. For time series, a two-way
ANOVA (time 3 diet) was performed
and a least significant difference paired
Student t test post hoc analysis was
used for comparison between the YesB
and NoB test days at each time point. For
clock gene expression, fasting (time point
0) was determined as baseline for the YesB
and NoB groups 3.5 h after (time point
210 min). Time point 210 min was deter-
mined as the baseline for the postlunch
(time point 420 min) gene expression. Stu-
dent t test analyses were performed to
evaluate differences between time points
within each group and treatment. The re-
sults are expressed as mean 6 SEM. A
P value #0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Statistical analysis was per-
formed with JMP software (version 12;
SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Participants
Thirty-six individuals (18 with type 2 di-
abetes and 18 healthy) were enrolled in
the study, with 32 participants complet-
ing (16 with type 2 diabetes and 16
healthy). During the first meal test day,
four dropped out (two healthy and two
with diabetes) because of problems in the
installation of the intravenous catheter.
Dropouts did not differ significantly from
those who continued the study. The pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes were 66.8 6
1.9 years of age and had the disease
for 14.5 6 1.5 years with 59.6 6 0.8
mmol/mol (7.6 6 0.1%) HbA1c and BMI
30.7 6 1.1 kg/m2 (Supplementary Table
1). Ten patients were treated with
diet alone, whereas six were treated
with diet and metformin. Seven pa-
tients had a history of hypertension and
were treated with ACE inhibitors and/or
calcium channel antagonists. The partic-
ipants in the healthy group were 44.3
6 2.9 years of age with 4.9 6 0.1% (30.1
6 0.6 mmol/mol) HbA1c and BMI 23.1 6
0.4 kg/m2 (Supplementary Table 1). They
were not taking any medications.
Clock Gene Expression on YesB and
NoB Days in Healthy Individuals
Versus Individuals With Diabetes
Before Lunch
In healthy individuals, the expression
level of Per1, Cry1, Rora, and Sirt1 was
lower (Student t test, P , 0.05), but Clock
was higher (Student t test, P , 0.05) after
breakfast (Fig. 1). In contrast, in individu-
als with type 2 diabetes, Per1, Per2, and
Sirt1 only slightly, but significantly, de-
creased and Rora increased (Student
t test, P , 0.05) after breakfast. Omission
of breakfast altered clock and metabolic
gene expression in both healthy people
and individuals with type 2 diabetes. In
healthy individuals, there was an in-
crease in the expression level of Bmal1,
Cry1, Rev-erba, Rora, and Sirt1 (Student
t test, P , 0.05), whereas in individuals
with type 2 diabetes, Clock expression in-
creased (Student t test, P , 0.05) (Fig. 1).
Inbothhealthyindividualsandindividuals
with diabetes, Per1 and Per2 expression
was not affected whether breakfast was
consumed or not (Fig. 1).

YesB day, whereas the other clock genes
remained unchanged (Fig. 2). In individu-
als with type 2 diabetes, Bmal1, Per1,
Per2, Rev-erba, and Ampk increased (Stu-

Skipping Breakfast Alters Circadian Expression

 whereas in individuals with type 2 diabe-
tes, Bmal1, Per1, and Ampk expression
decreased and Rora expression increased
(Student t test, P , 0.05) after lunch on
the NoB day (Fig. 2). Taken together,
breakfast and lunch led to increased ex-
pression of the positive loop and down-
regulation of the negative feedback loop,
whereas breakfast skipping altered this
expression pattern. Lunch, as the first
meal of the day, could not rectify the al-
tered clock expression. In addition, indi-
viduals with type 2 diabetes who skip
breakfast have a greater disruption of
their circadian rhythms compared with
those who consume breakfast.
Glucose, Insulin, and iGLP-1 Levels and
DPP-IV Activity on YesB and NoB Days
In the healthy group and group with di-
abetes, the AUCglucose after lunch was 15–
18% higher during the NoB day versus
the YesB day (P , 0.001) (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Table 2). In healthy par-
ticipants, AUCinsulin after lunch was not
significantly different between the tests
(P = 0.5). In contrast, in the group with
diabetes, the AUCinsulin after lunch was
25% lower on the NoB day compared
with the YesB day (P , 0.004) (Fig. 3
and Supplementary Table 2). In both the
healthy group and group with diabetes,
the AUCiGLP-1 afterlunch was ;35% lower
on the NoB day compared with the
YesB day (P , 0.0001) (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Table 2). No significant
change in plasma DPP-IV activity was
found after lunch between the groups
on YesB or NoB day.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we report for the first time
an acute postprandial effect on clock and
clock-controlled gene expression in both
healthy individuals and individuals with
type 2 diabetes. We showed that break-
fast skipping acutely disrupts circadian
rhythms in both healthy individuals and
people with type 2 diabetes. Further-
more, clock gene expression after lunch
was different and depended on whether
breakfast was consumed or not. Thus, the
study results suggest that breakfast con-
sumption is of high relevance for preserv-
ing clock gene activity, and this is true for
both healthy subjects and subjects with
diabetes.
Several reports have suggested that
meal timing exerts a pivotal influence
on peripheral clocks and clock output
systems involved in the regulation ofmet-
abolic pathways (1,26–29). Breakfast
skipping (22,30) and/or eating at hours
designed to sleep (21), for the long run,
lead to disruption of clock gene expres-
sion and are associated with weight gain
and diabetes (31,32). In contrast, acclima-
tion to timed feeding, high-energy break-
fast, and fasting during the hours
designed for sleep reversed impaired
clock gene expression and enhanced
AMPK expression, resulting in a more
efficient weight loss, insulin sensitivity,
and reduction of lipid accumulation
(21,22,30–32).
In healthy people, breakfast and lunch
acutely led to an overall increased expres-
sion of the positive loop of the core clock
mechanism, whereas the expression of
the negative feedback loop was downre-
gulated (Fig. 4). This pattern maintains
the normal cyclic expression of output

 systems (Fig. 4). In contrast, breakfast
skipping in healthy people led to an al-
tered clock gene expression pattern. After
lunch on the NoB day, Sirt1, Clock, Bmal1,
and Rora were upregulated and Per1 was
downregulated, similarly to the effect on
the YesB day (Fig. 4). However, unlike on
the YesB day, after lunch, Per2 and Ampk
were upregulated and Cry1 did not
change, disrupting the normal cyclic ex-
pression (Fig. 4).
In patients with type 2 diabetes, break-
fast and lunch eventually led to an overall
altered clock gene expression (Fig. 4).
However, Ampk expression was upregu-
lated after lunch. As AMPK activation
leads to glucose uptake, this upregulation
may indicate improved glycemic control,
as indeed was found herein. In contrast,
breakfast skipping in people with diabetes
furtherimparted a greaterdisruption, asit
also led to reduced Ampk levels, accentu-
ating blood glucose dysregulation (Fig. 4).
Our results show that the effect of
breakfastisacute,asonly1dayofskipping
breakfast led to such a deleterious effect
onclockand clock-controlled geneexpres-
sion. The rapid change in clock gene ex-
pression on YesB versus NoB days is
consistent with reports in animal models,
in which a 30-min feeding stimulus al-
tered clock gene expression within 2–4 h
(33,34). As feeding poses such an acute
effect, it is clear why long-term abnormal
patterns of clock gene expression are
manifested in obese individuals and indi-
viduals with diabetes.
A change in clock and clock-controlled
gene expression, due to breakfast omis-
sion, is expected to yield altered metabo-
lism. Impaired circadian rhythms have
been closely associated with the patho-
physiologyoftype2diabetes(4).Reduced
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, insu-
lin resistance, diminished b-cell prolifera-
tion, and apoptosis have been associated
with asynchrony or deficiencies in clock
genes (16). Indeed, in people with diabe-
tes, omission of breakfast led to a signif-
icant increase in postprandial glucose
excursions with reduced insulin and
iGLP-1 responses after lunch compared
with YesB day. Furthermore, this delete-
rious effect of breakfast skipping was also
observed in healthy participants, although
with a lower magnitude.
The reduction of hyperglycemia and
enhanced insulin response after lunch
with prior consumption of breakfast has
been described as the second meal
phenomenon and has been previously re-
ported in several studies in healthy in-
dividuals and individuals with type 2
diabetes (23,35). This has been explained
by enhanced b-cell responsiveness at the
second meal induced by the first meal
(36,37). This explanation is based on the
findings that both the first and the second
phase of insulin release are influenced by
b-cell memory, and the magnitude of in-
sulin release is enhanced significantly by
previous glucose exposure (37). The ab-
sence of glucose elevation due to fasting
until noon may diminish b-cell respon-
siveness and memory, leading to a re-
duced and delayed insulin response
after lunch on the NoB day. Indeed, it
was recently reported that lower insulin
release by b-cells in response to nutrient
depletion or starvation induces lysosomal
degradation of nascent secretory insulin
granules, and this is controlled by protein
kinase D (PKD), a key player in secretory
granule biogenesis (38). The impaired in-
sulin secretion at lunch on the NoB day
may also be due to perturbed incretin
regulation, since both b-cell memory
and sensitivity to glucose are enhanced
by GLP-1. Therefore, the higher levels of
GLP-1 on the YesB day may explain both
the enhanced insulin secretion and the
reduced glycemic response after lunch.
Atthe cellular level, the reduction ofpost-
prandial glycemia after lunch on the YesB
day can be explained by the fact that
breakfast triggers correct cyclic expres-
sion ofclockgenes, which, in turn,assures
metabolic efficiency, leading to normal
glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 responses af-
ter lunch. Ampk upregulation in partici-
pants with type 2 diabetes may enhance
GLUT4 translocation and muscular glu-
cose uptake, leading to improved post-
prandial glycemia.
At baseline, clock gene levels were dif-
ferent between the healthy group and
the group with type 2 diabetes, presum-
ablydue todifferencesrelatedtoage, body
weight, and/or HbA1c levels. Although the
age and body weight of the group with
type 2 diabetes was significantly different
from the healthy group, and may be a
limitation in our study, changes in clock
gene expression as a result of breakfast
skipping cannot be attributed to these
parameters, as each group was normal-
ized to its own baseline. In addition, the
crossover study assured that the same
person had both YesB and NoB treat-
ments, reiterating the effect of breakfast
skipping. Another limitation of our study
is that it was performed until after lunch.
Figure 4—Effect of lunch with or without prior breakfast on the interrelations between the clock
mechanism and metabolic proteins. CLOCK and BMAL1 mediate the expression of clock and clock-
controlled genes regulating circadian hormone secretion (insulin and glucagon), metabolism (glu-
coneogenesis and glycolysis), and glucose homeostasis. PER1, PER2, and CRY1 serve as the negative
feedback loop that inhibits CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated expression. SIRT1 and AMPK, when activated
under low cellular energy levels, relieve the inhibition mediated by the negative feedback loop.
BMAL1 expression is positively regulated by RORa and negatively regulated by REV-ERBa. Breakfast
consumption followed by lunch assures this overall cyclic regulation is maintained. Omission
of breakfast disrupts this cyclic regulation in both healthy people and patients with type 2 diabetes.

Skipping Breakfast Alters Circadian Expression
Diabetes Care Volume 40, November 2017
 Analyses of subsequent dinner and other
time points during the nighttime are re-
quired in order to determine overall daily
rhythms and how each meal affects this
oscillatory pattern. Insummary, our study
demonstrates that breakfast consump-
tion exerts a rapid influence on clock
and clock-controlled genes involved in
glucose regulation, such as Ampk, and
this effect is associated with a significant
reduction in postprandial glycemia and
enhanced insulin and GLP-1 responses
after subsequent lunch. In contrast, break-
fast skipping adversely affects the expres-
sion of clock and clock-controlled genes
involved in glucose metabolism in both
healthy individuals and individuals with di-
abetes. This study emphasizes the con-
sumption of breakfast as an important
strategy when targeting glycemic control
in type 2 diabetes. As the circadian clock
also regulates blood pressure, heart rate,
and cardiovascular activity, as well as adi-
pose tissue and other metabolic organs
(39), meal timing may affect overall me-
tabolism and influence chronic complica-
tions of obesity and type 2 diabetes.
