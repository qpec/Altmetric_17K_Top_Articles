 Sociodemographic Disparities in Chronic Pain, Based on 12-Year 
Longitudinal Data

Abstract
Existing estimates of sociodemographic disparities in chronic pain in the United States are based 
on cross-sectional data, often treat pain as a binary construct, and rarely test for non-response or 
other types of bias. This study uses seven biennial waves of national data from the Health and 
Retirement Study (1998–2010; n = 19,776) to describe long-term pain disparities among older 
(age 51+) American adults. It also investigates whether pain severity, reporting heterogeneity, 
survey non-response, and/or mortality selection might bias estimates of social disparities in pain. 
In the process, the article clarifies whether two unexpected patterns observed cross-sectionally—
plateauing of pain above age 60, and lower pain among racial/ethnic minorities—are genuine or 
artefactual. Findings show high prevalence of chronic pain: 27.3% at baseline, increasing to 36.6% 
thereafter. Multivariate latent growth curve models reveal extremely large disparities in pain by 
sex, education, and wealth, which manifest primarily as differences in intercept. Net of these 
variables, there is no racial/ethnic minority disadvantage in pain scores, and indeed a black 
advantage. Pain levels are predictive of subsequent death, even a decade in the future. No evidence 
of pain-related survey attrition is found, but surveys not accounting for pain severity and reporting 
heterogeneity are likely to underestimate socioeconomic disparities in pain. The lack of minority 
disadvantage (net of socioeconomic status) appears genuine. However, the age-related plateauing 
of pain observed cross-sectionally is not replicated longitudinally, and appears partially 
attributable to mortality selection, as well as to rising pain levels by birth cohort.

INTRODUCTION
As awareness of chronic pain as a serious and costly public health problem grows [26, 34], 
an increasing number of studies provide estimates of pain’s prevalence and distribution in 
the general U.S. population [9, 29, 36, 37, 46, 47, 51, 54, 59, 61]. However, nearly all such 
studies rely on cross-sectional data and binary pain measures, and do not consider the

 potential role of measurement bias. The present study uses 12-year longitudinal data and 
directly tests for several types of bias to provide a more complete portrait of social 
disparities in chronic pain. In the process, the study clarifies whether findings from prior 
research are genuine or artefacts of measurement error.
While definitions and measures of chronic pain vary, sometimes quite markedly, existing 
studies agree that prevalence among U.S. adults is high: 11% to 47% [9, 46]. Moreover, four 
consistent patterns regarding sociodemographic disparities in chronic pain emerge: 1) 
Women experience higher rates of pain than do men [29, 36, 37, 47, 51, 54, 59, 61]. 2) 
Higher income individuals report pain less often than lower income individuals [9, 29, 36, 
47, 51, 54]. 3) Likelihood of pain rises with age until approximately age 60, at which point it 
plateaus or decreases [9, 29, 36, 37, 46, 47, 54, 59]. 4) Non-Hispanic whites report pain 
more frequently than non-Hispanic blacks or Hispanics [29, 36, 37, 46, 47, 54, 59].
The first two of these patterns are unsurprising: voluminous clinical and experimental 
literature finds women to report more pain than men [25, 38], and disparities in health by 
income are widely documented [8, 44, 52]. The latter two patterns, however, are unexpected. 
Given that disease burden (including of pain-producing conditions such as osteoarthritis) 
increases with age, one might well expect a continuing increase in pain with age [20, 32]. 
Similarly, the observed minority advantage in pain is at odds with U.S. minorities’ (in 
particular African-Americans’) overall poorer health [15, 64, 65], and with minorities’ less 
comprehensive treatment for pain [1, 16, 49, 55].
Could these unexpected findings result from measurement bias? Both theoretical and 
empirical literature suggests that different social groups (men versus women, different racial/
ethnic groups, etc.) may exhibit reporting heterogeneity, i.e., systematically different ways 
of rating pain [12, 17, 22, 28]. Non-response bias and mortality selection [63] are also 
potential sources of bias in any health survey.
This study uses seven waves of biennial data from a nationally-representative survey of older 
(age 51+) American adults to conduct two types of analyses. 1) First, it describes 
sociodemographic disparities in non-site-specific, chronic noncancer pain using longitudinal 
data. Do disparities widen with age (consistent with the cumulative disadvantage hypothesis) 
or narrow (consistent with the age-as-leveler hypothesis) [24]? Is the plateauing of pain after 
age 60, as observed cross-sectionally, replicated longitudinally? 2) Second, this study 
investigates four possible sources of measurement bias: pain severity, reporting 
heterogeneity, survey non-response, and mortality selection. Do these factors bias estimates 
of social disparities in pain, and if so, how? In particular, could the apparent minority 
advantage in pain be a consequence of reporting heterogeneity? Could the plateauing of pain 
after age 60 reflect mortality selection and/or non-response bias?
Overall, this study provides a fuller view of the national distribution of chronic pain, and 
identifies key sources of measurement bias relevant to pain disparities research.

 METHODS
Data
This study is based on secondary analysis of seven consecutive biennial waves of the Health 
and Retirement Study (HRS; http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php), a study sponsored by 
the National Institute of Aging (grant number NIA U01AG009740) and conducted by the 
University of Michigan. The HRS began in 1992, and by 1998 was expanded to be 
nationally representative of the non-institutionalized above-50 population of the United 
States. The 1998 response rate was 83.75% [58]. Respondents were non-institutionalized at 
baseline, but were followed if they moved to institutions in subsequent waves [30]. Surveys 
have been repeated every two years, with respondents interviewed by telephone or in-person 
depending on health and preferences. Follow-up response rates for the non-deceased have 
been high (85%-93%) [31], including among racial/ethnic minorities, a fact attributed to 
high quality training of interviewers and targeted follow-up strategies [50].
The present analyses start with the 1998 over-50 sample, and follow this group over seven 
waves. This closed cohort design was selected so that 12 years’ worth of data would be 
available for all respondents except in cases of non-response or death. Of baseline 
respondents (n = 20,007), 331 were excluded for missing all information about education or 
pain status, yielding an analytic sample of 19,776. The HRS oversamples African-
Americans, Hispanics, and Floridians, and uses a different sampling frame for “oldest old” 
respondents [30]; sampling weights must thus be used to generate estimates representative of 
the population. Based on HRS-provided sampling weights, the analytic sample represents 
67,338,111 Americans.
Measures
Pain—Since 1998, HRS biennial waves have used identical wording for pain-related 
questions. The initial question reads, “Are you often troubled with pain?” Respondents 
answering “yes” are here considered to be experiencing chronic pain. This wording has the 
advantage of not priming respondents to privilege continuous over episodic pain, or 
requiring respondents to be experiencing pain at the moment of the interview. Prior research 
finds that respondents are less than half as likely to report being “often troubled by pain” as 
to report experiencing “any pain in the last 30 days” [5], indicating that the HRS question is 
unlikely to capture fleeting or trivial experiences of pain.
Respondents answering “Yes” to the opening question are then asked, “How bad is the pain 
most of the time: mild, moderate or severe?”. Responses to this question were combined 
with the prior one to create a 4-category “pain status” variable for each survey wave: no pain 
(0), mild pain (1), moderate pain (2), and severe pain (3). Pain status was treated as a ratio 
variable in some analyses, as in prior studies [23]. Because this study focuses on chronic 
noncancer pain, pain status was set to missing when pain was likely due to cancer or cancer 
treatment, i.e., when respondents had received a new cancer diagnosis, received treatment 
for cancer, or reported that their cancer had gotten worse since the last study wave. This 
cancer exclusion affected between .67% and 3.38% of the sample depending on wave.

 The final question in the series, “Does the pain make it difficult for you to do your usual 
activities such as household chores or work?”, serves as a measure of pain-related disability 
in the tests of reporting heterogeneity described below. Its mention of both household and 
out-of-house work makes it appropriate for a population of mixed employment and 
retirement statuses.
Item non-response for pain questions was very low, never exceeding 1.8%. Wave non-
response (conditional on survivorship) ranged from 5.76% in 2000 to 14.37% in 2010.
Covariates—Demographic variables used in analyses include sex, age in 1998 
(categorized as 51–59, 60–69, 70–79, and 80 or above), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black or African-American, and Hispanic—henceforth “white”, “black” and 
“Hispanic” for brevity; the category “non-Hispanic other” was too small to be analyzed), 
highest level of education (less than high school, high school diploma, 4-year college 
degree, and graduate degree), 1998 household wealth quartiles (with mean values, in U.S. 
dollars, of $6,286, $75,032, $200,899, and $937,662), and a “survival status” variable 
indicating whether the respondent died before the end of the study period. Wealth was 
included rather than income based on evidence of non-linear relationships between income 
and overall socioeconomic standing when looking at populations of mixed retirement 
statuses [27]. Socioeconomic characteristics of the analytic sample are summarized in Table 
1.
Analytic strategy
To summarize chronic pain’s prevalence and distribution, time series graphs of pain status 
were constructed for the full population and for specific sociodemographic groups. To assess 
multivariate associations, a probit-based latent growth curve model was run using the seven 
waves of pain data and all key covariates. Latent growth curve models depict the underlying 
latent trajectory of change in terms of an intercept and a slope, with variation by time-
invariant covariates treated as deviations from this general intercept and slope [7]. The 
model was estimated under missing data theory using all available data [45]; findings using 
listwise deletion of respondents missing pain status were extremely similar.
The likely direction of bias due to reporting heterogeneity was estimated by comparing the 
association between reported levels of pain and of pain-related disability across groups. If 
one group is more stoical in pain reporting than another (for example, if its members call 
“moderate” what others would call “severe”), we would expect the stoical group to 
experience more disability for a given level of pain (i.e., we would expect their “moderate” 
pain to cause greater functional disruption than the other group’s “moderate” pain). 
Estimating such differences in reporting style could clarify whether studies likely under- or 
overestimate group differences in pain. Concretely, reporting heterogeneity was assessed via 
logistic regression of pain-related disability (yes/no) on the core sociodemographic variables 
plus self-reported pain severity. Because findings were similar across survey waves, results 
from a model pooling all seven waves of data are presented.
To clarify whether focusing on prevalence rather than severity might bias estimates of pain 
disparities, the distribution of any, mild, moderate, and severe pain by sociodemographic

 group was calculated, also using pooled data from all seven waves. To assess pain-related 
survey non-response (in the form of attrition bias), I conducted a logistic regression of wave 
nonresponse on categorical pain status at the prior survey wave, conditional on survivorship.
Mortality selection occurs if high-pain individuals are more likely to die and hence exit the 
population than low-pain individuals (regardless of whether this association is causal [57]). 
This leads to a reduced slope in the graph of pain by age, which reflects population 
compositional changes, i.e., it can occur even if mean pain increases steadily with age 
among survivors [63]. To test whether mortality selection contributes to the apparent 
plateauing of pain after age 60, I conducted a logistic regression of death by a given survey 
wave on categorical pain status at the prior wave. Mortality selection was also assessed by 
comparing mean pain across time for decedents, survivors, and the full sample, to examine 
whether decedents have higher average pain scores than survivors, and whether the full-
sample slope is flatter than that for either survivors or decedents separately.
All presented graphs and analyses are sample weight-adjusted, except those aiming to 
identify quasi-causal relationships rather than to describe population parameters [66] (i.e., 
the tests of attrition bias, mortality selection, and reporting heterogeneity).
Stata MP/13.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) was used for all analyses except the 
latent growth curve model, which was implemented with Mplus version 7.31 (Muthén & 
Muthén, Los Angeles, CA). Code is available upon request.
RESULTS
Longitudinal disparities in pain: Bivariate results
Figure 1 shows the proportion of respondents in each pain status category (no, mild, 
moderate, or severe pain) by survey wave. In 1998, 27.3% of respondents reported that they 
were often troubled with pain; by 2010 this had increased to 36.6%. The ratio of mild to 
moderate to severe pain remained fairly constant across the 7 waves, at approximately 3:6:2.
Figure 2 shows graphs of mean pain status over time by sex, education, wealth, race/
ethnicity, age group, and survival status. All groups show an upward slope in mean pain, 
with slopes generally roughly parallel across groups. Intercepts, however, often differ 
dramatically across groups. As shown in panel A, women consistently report higher pain 
than men—on average, 38% higher. Panels B and C show large gradients by socioeconomic 
status, with pain scores monotonically lower with each categorical increase in education or 
wealth. On average, respondents with no high school degree have pain scores over twice as 
high as respondents with graduate degrees. Similarly, the least wealthy respondents have 
scores an average of 78% higher than the wealthiest. Mean pain scores by race/ethnicity 
(Figure 2 panel D) are relatively closely clustered together. While some racial/ethnic 
differences are significant in bivariate models, these patterns change in models with 
socioeconomic controls, as discussed below.
Mean pain scores for respondents in each baseline age group are shown in Figure 2, panel E. 
Mean pain rises with time in each age group, undermining the claim that pain plateaus or

 declines after age 60. At the same time, mean pain scores for most age groups are virtually 
indistinguishable throughout the 12-year period, with only respondents 80 or older showing 
noticeably higher pain scores in most waves. If a researcher were to use data from a single 
wave only, then mean pain scores would indeed appear to plateau with age, except for a 
possible rise after age 80.
This graph also indicates that pain is worsening by period, above and beyond worsening 
with age. For example, in 1998, respondents in their 60s had a mean pain score of .50. In 
2008, respondents in their 60s (i.e., who had been in their 50s at baseline) had a significantly 
higher mean pain score of .66—a 32% increase. Findings are similar for respondents in their 
70s, whose pain scores were 28% higher in 2008 than in 1998. (Respondents in their 80s had 
similar levels of pain in 1998 and 2008, however.)
Figure 2, panel F compares mean pain scores for respondents who died during the 12-year 
study period and those who survived throughout. The difference between the two groups is 
large and consistently significant, with decedents having, on average, 31% higher pain 
scores than survivors.
Longitudinal disparities in pain: Multivariate results
Results from a multivariate latent growth curve model of disparities in chronic pain over 
time are presented in Table 2. Goodness-of-fit measures suggest “extremely good” fit [40], 
with the RMSEA below .01 and the CFI and TLI very near one. The patterns observed in 
Figure 2 for sex, education, wealth, and survival status persist in multivariate context. As 
shown by substantively and statistically significant coefficients for the intercept (left half of 
Table 2), women have higher levels of pain than men (β = .199; P < .001), and both 
education and wealth are negatively associated with pain levels, with each increase in 
education or wealth associated with a lower intercept. Differences in intercept between those 
in the lowest and highest educational category (β = .415) or wealth category (β = .321) are 
quite large—larger than the difference between men and women. Respondents who died 
during the study also had a significantly higher intercept than those who survived (β = .283; 
P < .001), though also a lower slope (reflecting exit of high-pain individuals due to death).
Not all patterns observed in Figure 2 persist in the multivariate model, however. Once 
education and wealth are controlled for, the previously observed pain disadvantage of 
Hispanics relative to whites disappears, as shown by the lack of significant differences in 
intercept or slope. Moreover, inclusion of socioeconomic controls shows African-Americans 
to have a significantly lower intercept than whites (β = −0.112; P < 0.001). In other words, 
the minority disadvantage in pain scores observed earlier is attributable to lower 
socioeconomic standing; once this is controlled for, the disadvantage disappears (for 
Hispanics) or reverses (for blacks).
Across successively older baseline age groups, the intercept for the latent curve decreases 
monotonically, i.e., net of other covariates, older cohorts have lower pain levels. This 
supports the earlier observation that pain levels appear to be increasing over time, 
disadvantaging younger birth cohorts. Nonetheless, the slope for all age groups is positive

 (since both the slope constant and the age-specific slope coefficients are positive), showing 
that within age categories pain increases with age, and accelerates at older ages.
With the noted exceptions, differences across groups in terms of slope were generally small 
and not statistically significant (Table 2, right half). In contrast, all intercept coefficients 
except one (for Hispanics) were statistically and substantively significant. Consistent with 
Figure 2, then, pain disparities across socioeconomic groups manifest primarily as 
differences in intercept.
Disparities in any pain versus in pain severity
Table 3 shows the percentage of respondents in each group who reported any pain and, 
conditional on reporting pain, who reported mild, moderate, and severe pain. (Data are 
pooled from all seven survey waves; individual waves show very similar percentages.) The 
table reveals that disparities in chronic pain by sex, education, wealth, and survival status are 
likely underestimated in studies relying on binary pain measures: not only are disadvantaged 
groups in these categories more likely to report any pain, but the pain is more likely to be 
severe. Thus, women are not only 28% more likely than men to report chronic pain (34.62% 
vs. 27.09%), they are also 37% more likely to report that their pain is severe (19.77% vs. 
14.43%). Differences in pain severity are even more pronounced by education and wealth: 
e.g., 25.57% of pain sufferers without a high school degree term their pain “severe”, while 
only 9.79% of those with graduate degrees do. The difference across wealth quartiles is 
similar. Higher pain scores among respondents who died during the study period also reflect 
a combination of prevalence and severity: decedents were 18% more likely to report any 
pain, and, among those with pain, 48% more likely to deem the pain severe. (All differences 
noted are statistically significant.)
Across racial/ethnic groups, the pattern in Table 3 is somewhat more complex, with 
Hispanics the most likely to report any pain, but blacks the most likely to report that their 
pain is severe. Indeed, combining information about pain prevalence and severity reveals 
that 8.8% of all blacks report severe pain, compared to 8.3% of all Hispanics. How one 
ranks blacks versus Hispanics in terms of pain burden thus depends on whether one 
prioritizes prevalence or severity. Whites have both the lowest prevalence and lowest level of 
severe pain among the three groups, with only 4.96% of whites experiencing severe pain. 
Differences across age categories were relatively small and usually not statistically 
significant.
Reporting heterogeneity
Results of the logistic regression of pain-related disability on sociodemographic covariates 
(controlling for pain severity) are shown in Table 4. Odds ratios above 1 reflect relative 
stoicism in reporting pain, as they indicate that for a given level of reported pain, members 
of the group are more likely to experience pain-related disability (suggesting that the pain 
level itself may be understated). Odds ratios below 1 reflect greater expressiveness in 
reporting pain.
By this interpretation, many socioeconomic disparities in pain reported earlier appear to be 
underestimates. Groups already reporting the most pain—women, the less educated, and the 
Grol-Prokopczyk

Author Manuscript
 less wealthy—also appear to be the most stoical in reporting pain. If this were accounted for, 
disparities across groups would appear even larger.
Across racial/ethnic categories, no significant differences in reporting styles were found 
between blacks and whites, suggesting that the black advantage found in the multivariate 
model (Table 3) is genuine, i.e., not an artefact of reporting heterogeneity. However, 
Hispanics do appear significantly more expressive than whites, complicating interpretation 
of relative pain burden: Hispanics may, like blacks, have lower average pain scores than 
whites after all.
The foregoing interpretations assume that self-reported pain-related disability is free from, 
or at least less prone to, reporting heterogeneity than self-reported pain. If, however, both 
questions are subject to similar tendencies toward stoicism or expressiveness, then the 
present findings may be less illuminating than tautological. These findings are thus 
presented as tentative, not definitive, assessments of reporting heterogeneity.
Non-response bias and mortality selection
Results of tests of attrition bias can be briefly summarized: little to no evidence was found 
that pain predicts survey attrition. Odds of wave non-response were not significantly higher 
for those reporting pain (regardless of severity) in the prior wave than for those without pain, 
with the lone exception of higher non-response in 2000 among 1998 respondents with severe 
pain (OR = 1.29; P < .05).
Results of tests of mortality selection were also very consistent, but in the opposite direction: 
pain, specifically moderate and severe pain, strongly and consistently predicted death by the 
next wave (P < 0.01 in all cases). Compared to pain-free respondents and controlling for age 
in years, those with moderate pain had on average 0.72 the odds of surviving until the next 
survey wave (range across waves: .64–77), and those with severe pain had 0.50 the odds 
(range: .42–55). Those with mild pain had 0.87 the odds (range: .78–1.01), but this was not 
statistically significant.
Figure 3 presents mean pain scores over time for decedents by period of death, for survivors, 
and for the full sample. As noted, decedents experience higher pain than survivors in the 
years before death. In addition, Figure 3 shows that the earlier in the study period 
respondents die, the higher their mean pain tends to be, both at baseline and in subsequent 
waves. (Similar patterns are observed when restricting the sample to specific age categories.) 
Higher pain among decedents cannot merely reflect acute pain in the final months of life, as 
higher pain at baseline predicts death even 10–12 years later. Pain appears to serve as a 
marker of long-term mortality risk.
Figure 3 also shows that the slope for the full sample is less steep than the slope for 
survivors or for any group of decedents. This is a clear example of mortality selection: 
within all population subgroups, pain increases fairly steadily with time, but higher pain 
individuals are more likely to die and thus to exit the population. Such compositional 
changes lead the full population slope to appear more shallow than the slope for any 
individual subgroup.

 DISCUSSION
To heed recent calls to take chronic pain seriously as a public health problem [10, 19, 34], as 
well as to better understand and address U.S. health disparities [8, 11, 13], accurate 
estimation of pain’s prevalence, long-term patterns, and sociodemographic distribution is 
needed. This study uses 12-year longitudinal data to describe the national distribution of 
chronic noncancer pain among older (age 51+) American adults, and to investigate whether 
and how pain severity, reporting heterogeneity, survey non-response, and mortality selection 
might bias estimates of social disparities in pain. Like prior studies using national samples, 
this one finds chronic pain prevalence to be high: 27.3% in 1998, rising to 36.6% twelve 
years later. Several additional key points may be highlighted from the present findings.
First, disparities in chronic pain by sex and, especially, socioeconomic status (SES) are 
extremely large, in both bivariate and multivariate contexts. In contrast, while racial/ethnic 
minorities have slightly higher pain scores (and experience more severe pain) than whites in 
bivariate analyses, this disadvantage in pain scores disappears when controlling for 
socioeconomic status, and indeed a black advantage vis-à-vis whites emerges.
Next, studies that do not account for group differences in pain severity and/or in styles of 
rating pain (which includes most existing studies) are likely to underestimate pain disparities 
by sex and socioeconomic status. Women, the less educated, and the less wealthy experience 
not only more pain, but also more severe pain, as well as greater disability for a given 
reported level of pain. Tests of reporting heterogeneity show no difference between white 
and black pain rating styles, however, indicating that the aforementioned black advantage is 
likely genuine. (Hispanics show a more expressive rating style than other groups, consistent 
with prior studies [22, 56]; were this accounted for, Hispanics might also show a lower pain 
burden than whites in multivariate models.)
Next, chronic noncancer pain (in particular moderate or severe pain) strongly predicts death. 
Mortality selection thus leads to underestimation of the rise in pain with age when using 
cross-sectional data. The cross-sectional finding that pain plateaus or declines after age 60 
[9, 29, 47, 59] is not replicated longitudinally. Instead, all age cohorts—including those 
above age 60—show steady increases in mean pain scores over time. Cross-sectional 
findings are biased by the higher death rates of high-pain individuals, leading to an apparent 
flattening of the pain curve.
Finally, the burden of pain appears to be increasing not only with age, but with time, i.e., 
younger birth cohorts faces higher pain levels than older ones (controlling for age). This 
phenomenon further contributes to the appearance of plateauing pain levels when using 
cross-sectional data. This finding corroborates recent research based on National Health 
Interview Survey data, which finds rising rates of chronic pain in the U.S. between 1997–
1999 and 2011–2013 [14] (very close to the present study’s range of 1998–2010).
Comparing current findings with those of prior research more broadly, we may note that the 
main claims of cross-sectional pain disparities studies (summarized in the introduction) are 
supported here, except for the plateauing of pain with age. However, effect sizes from prior 
studies must be interpreted cautiously, as most studies do not incorporate information on

 pain severity or reporting heterogeneity, and thus likely underestimate disparities by sex and 
socioeconomic status. Previous longitudinal research on chronic conditions such as 
hypertension and diabetes suggests that cumulative disadvantage (health differentials 
widening with age) is likely to be observed when mortality selection is accounted for [24]. 
In the present study, however, differences in pain by sex, education, and wealth remain 
roughly parallel over time, even when controlling for mortality—a pattern consistent neither 
with the cumulative disadvantage hypothesis nor the age-as-leveler hypothesis. Chronic pain 
may follow a different long-term pattern than other common chronic conditions.
For health disparities researchers and pain epidemiologists, a key methodological 
implication of these findings is to attend to pain severity, reporting heterogeneity, and 
mortality selection as sources of measurement bias. (Techniques for overcoming reporting 
heterogeneity remain challenging to develop, however [28].) Non-response bias may be 
worth attending to as well, despite lack of evidence for it in this study. Not only did the 
present data permit testing only for attrition bias rather than general non-response bias, but 
even the findings regarding attrition could reflect a unique feature of the HRS: that 
respondents who become institutionalized continue to be interviewed. Many surveys exclude 
institutionalized respondents, and thus may lose high-pain individuals who move to nursing 
homes.
This study also underscores the importance of further research on mechanisms underlying 
socioeconomic disparities in pain. While sex differences in pain experiences have been “a 
topic of tremendous scientific interest” for the past two decades—yielding a broad set of 
biological and psychosocial explanations for such differences [25:447]—comprehensive 
explorations of mechanisms linking socioeconomic status to chronic pain at the population 
level have been much rarer [6]. This may be changing, however, with recent studies 
(especially European ones) exploring specific diseases [21], job characteristics [39], 
neighborhood effects [6], and mental health [41] as mediating factors. A U.S.-based article 
notes that low SES individuals are more likely to be perceived by healthcare providers as 
exaggerating pain, and to have bureaucratic difficulties contending with health insurance, if 
they have insurance at all [33]. (Clinicians may wish to take note of such findings, to ensure 
that their own clinical practices do not contribute to poor treatment of the socially 
disadvantaged.) Research clarifying the relative importance of these and additional factors, 
and testing for generalizability across countries, would help answer why large 
socioeconomic disparities in pain are observed, and how they might be effectively 
addressed.
Recent years have also seen growing scholarly interest in the association between chronic 
pain and death. Studies have tested whether or not specific pain conditions predict mortality 
[3, 4]), and whether the association between chronic pain and death is causal or spurious [2, 
43, 60, 67]—a question still without definitive answer [57]. Further research would ideally 
clarify why chronic pain predicts death, and what can be done about it.
This study has several key limitations beyond those already discussed. First, the HRS’s 
measure of pain (“Are you often troubled by pain?”) does not match common definitions of 
chronic pain as pain lasting at least three months [35] or six months [62]. Nonetheless,

 estimates presented here align with those of several prior studies [29, 36, 37, 53]. For 
example, a study using 2010 NHIS data finds 27.6% of Americans 50 or older to experience 
“persistent pain” [37]—an estimate extremely close to the current baseline estimate of 
27.3%. Moreover, the present pain measure has advantages over those of some other studies. 
Unlike in the National Center for Health Statistic’s 2006 report, there is no requirement that 
pain “persist for more than 24 hours” [47]—a criterion which could exclude people who 
experience pain regularly, even daily, but only in briefer bursts, e.g., while walking. Unlike 
in Tsang et al. (2008) [61], pain is not defined by specific conditions such as arthritis and 
headaches—which, if mild or well-managed, might not be considered chronic pain by the 
respondent [37]. Such differences in pain definition and measurement likely explain why 
this article’s prevalence estimates fall in the mid-range of recent estimates.
Additional limitations result from sample characteristics. Because the sample is restricted to 
Americans above age 50, generalization to the full U.S. population is not possible. 
Moreover, findings from the U.S. may not generalize to other countries, due to differences in 
health care systems, treatment regimens, etc. (One may note, for example, that Americans 
constitute only 4.6% of the world’s population, but consume “80% of the global opioid 
supply,” and even higher percentages of specific opioids [42]. Could such heavy use of 
opioid analgesics directly or indirectly contribute to the association between pain and death, 
as has been suggested [14]?)
A key message from this study for both researchers and policy makers is that addressing 
health and mortality disparities in the U.S. will have to involve addressing pain disparities. 
As shown, chronic pain is not only extremely common, but it is strongly patterned by 
socioeconomic class. It is also highly disabling [18], has been proposed as a cause of recent 
mortality increases among middle-aged Americans [14], and may well contribute to the 
U.S.’s poor standing among peer countries in rankings of life expectancy [48].
Especially when paired with evidence of rising pain prevalence, these are strong arguments 
for prioritizing chronic pain research and treatment. If pain is merely a marker of mortality 
risk, research should clarify and address the root causes of the association. If pain itself 
raises mortality risk, then pain is doubly injurious, depriving its sufferers not only of quality 
of life but of life itself. In either case, continued efforts to better understand pain at the 
population level—and especially to explain and address its high prevalence and dramatically 
unequal distribution—are needed.
