OBJECTIVES: To determine whether higher cumulative
proton pump inhibitor (PPI) exposure is associated with
greater dementia risk.
DESIGN: Prospective population-based cohort study.
SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Washington, an integrated
healthcare delivery system in Seattle, Washington.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older without
dementia at study entry (N = 3,484).
MEASUREMENTS: Participants
were
screened
for
dementia every 2 years, and those who screened positive
underwent extensive evaluation. Dementia outcomes were
determined using standard diagnostic criteria. Time-vary-
ing PPI
exposure
was
determined
from
computerized
pharmacy data and consisted of total standardized daily
doses (TSDDs) dispensed to an individual in the prior
10 years. We also assessed duration of use. Multivariable
Cox regression
was used
to estimate
the
association
between PPI exposure and time to dementia or Alzheimer’s
disease (AD).
RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 7.5 years, 827 par-
ticipants (23.7%) developed dementia (670 with possible
or probable AD). PPI exposure was not associated with
risk of dementia (P = .66) or AD (P = .77). For dementia,
the risk for specific levels of cumulative exposure com-
pared to no use was:
365 TSDDs (HR 0.87, 95% CI
0.65–1.18), 1,095 TSDDs (HR 0.99, CI 0.75–1.30) and
1,825 TSDDs (HR 1.13, CI 0.82–1.56).
These TSDD
levels represent approximately 1, 3 and 5 years of daily
use respectively. Duration of PPI use was not associated
with dementia outcomes either.
CONCLUSION: Proton pump inhibitor use was not asso-
ciated with dementia risk, even for people with high cumu-
lative exposure. Although there are other safety concerns
with long-term PPI use, results from our study do not sup-
port that these medications should be avoided out of con-
cern about dementia risk. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:247–253,

Key words: dementia; Alzheimer disease; pharmacoepi-

P
roton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used to treat
acid-related gastrointestinal disorders, including gas-
troesophageal reflux disease. In 2011, approximately one
in five older adults in the United States reported using a
PPI,1 and these medications are frequently used over the
long term.2 PPIs are overprescribed across the spectrum of
care, including in primary care, inpatient, and nursing
home settings,3,4 with estimates that up to 40% of use is
not supported by evidence.5 PPIs are often prescribed inap-
propriately for stress ulcer prevention in hospitalized indi-
viduals and continued after discharge.6
For many years, PPIs were thought to have minimal
toxicity, but mounting evidence suggests that they may be
associated with negative health consequences, including
fractures and kidney disease.7,8 Especially troubling is the
potential link between PPI use and dementia risk.9–11
Researchers from Germany first reported an association
between PPI use and dementia in a multicenter cohort
study of older adults in primary care.9 Two studies using
administrative data also reported greater dementia risk
with PPI use,10,11 but relying on administrative data to
identify incident dementia cases may be problematic. Prior
studies were unable to control for potential confounders
such as exercise, obesity, functional status, and nons-
teroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Despite these

 limitations, there is some biological plausibility for these
findings. PPIs may accelerate senescence in human endothe-
lial cells and affect amyloid metabolism in cellular and ani-
mal models of AD, although data are conflicting for the
latter.12–14 It has also been postulated that PPIs increase
dementia risk by contributing to vitamin B12 deficiency,9,10
which can occur with long-term gastric acid suppression.15
Given the enormous public health implications of
widespread PPI use, a better understanding of potential
cognitive risks of cumulative PPI use is urgently needed.
Unanswered questions remain regarding the effect of dose
and duration of use beyond 18 months. Longer PPI expo-
sure may be particularly relevant for a condition with a
long latent period such as dementia. We used data from a
prospective cohort study with research-quality dementia
diagnoses, detailed electronic pharmacy data, and exten-
sive capture of participant health, functional, and other
confounding characteristics to evaluate the association
between cumulative PPI use over a long exposure window
and the risk of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We
hypothesized that higher cumulative use would be associ-
ated with greater risk.
METHODS
Design, Study Setting, and Participants
The Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study is a population-
based prospective cohort study conducted within Kaiser
Permanente Washington an integrated healthcare delivery
system in the northwest US, previously known as Group
Health. Study methods have been described in detail else-
where.16 Participants aged 65 and older without dementia
were randomly sampled from Seattle-area members. Partic-
ipants were enrolled during three waves: the original
cohort between 1994 and 1996 (n = 2,581), the expansion
cohort between 2000 and 2003 (n = 811), and continuous
enrollment beginning in 2004. Participants were assessed
at study entry and at 2-year intervals to evaluate cognitive
function and collect information about demographic char-
acteristics, medical history, health behaviors, and func-
tional measures. The ACT study has an excellent index of
completeness of follow-up (>95%).17 These analyses were
limited to participants with at least one follow-up visit
(4,221 subjects as of April 30, 2014). To ensure adequate
information about long-term medication exposure, we
excluded participants with less than 10 years of health
plan membership before ACT enrollment (n = 737), leav-
ing a sample of 3,484 for this analysis. Our Human Sub-
jects Review Committee approves study procedures, and
participants provide written informed consent.
Assessment of Dementia and AD
Participants were screened for dementia at study entry and
every
2 years
using
the
Cognitive
Abilities
Screening
Instrument (CASI).18 Those screening positive on the CASI
(score ≤85) underwent a standardized diagnostic evalua-
tion that included neuropsychological testing.16 A multidis-
ciplinary committee assigned diagnoses of dementia and
AD using research criteria.19,20 Date of dementia onset
was assigned as the midpoint between the ACT study visit
triggering the dementia evaluation and the preceding visit.
Participants with new onset of dementia underwent one
follow-up examination to confirm the diagnosis.
PPI Exposure
Proton pump inhibitor use was ascertained from computer-
ized pharmacy data that included drug name, strength,
route of administration, date dispensed, and amount dis-
pensed. PPIs first became available as prescription medica-
tions
in
1989
and
some
as
over-the-counter
(OTC)
medications in late 2003. The health plan continued to
cover prescription PPIs that were also available OTC.
Information was collected at interviews every 2 years
about self-reported current medication use, including use
of
OTC
medications.
We
supplemented
prescription
records with information about self-reported nonprescrip-
tion medications to increase capture of OTC PPI usage.
Our primary exposure measure was cumulative dose,
measured as follows. We first calculated the total PPI dose
for
each
prescription
by
multiplying
the
medication
strength by the number of tablets dispensed. We then cal-
culated the number of standardized daily doses (SDDs) for
each prescription by dividing the total PPI dose by the
minimum effective dose per day for the product (omepra-
zole 20 mg, pantoprazole 40 mg, esomeprazole 20 mg,
lansoprazole 30 mg, and rabeprazole 20 mg). After con-
verting the prescriptions to SDDs, we determined each par-
ticipant’s time-varying cumulative PPI exposure—measured
as total SDD (TSDD)—at each point in time during study
follow-up21,22 summing the SDDs for all of a participant’s
PPI pharmacy fills within the past 10 years after excluding
prescriptions in the most recent year to address bias that
might result from altered use of PPIs during the prodromal
phase of dementia.23 Figure S1 illustrates how the time-
varying exposure window was defined. The reason we lim-
ited exposure measurement to 10-year windows rather
than examining all available data for each individual was
to ensure a common exposure assessment period for all
individuals being compared at each point during follow-
up. Otherwise, differential error in exposure capture could
have led to biased results. Also, a 10-year exposure period
was thought to be sufficiently long to ensure reasonably
good capture of cumulative exposure levels across individ-
uals. To incorporate OTC use into our exposure measure,
we added 100 SDDs to the TSDD from visits at which
participants reported current use of OTC PPIs (only 16
visits involving 15 participants).24
Because the precise aspect of PPI exposure that may
affect dementia risk is not known, we also examined two
additional exposure constructs using the same 10-year win-
dow approach: total duration of use and longest duration
of continuous use. We measured duration by first deter-
mining episodes of PPI use for each person in our sample
on the basis of prescription fill dates, days supply, an
assumed compliance factor (80%) for adhering to the pre-
scribed regimen, and a stockpiling algorithm to account
for the fact that people may refill prescriptions early (be-
fore the prior fill’s run-out date) adapted from prior
work.25,26 Then at each point in time during study follow-
up for each participant, we computed the total duration of
all the person’s distinct episodes of PPI use within the
248

 current 10-year exposure window after excluding prescrip-
tions in the most recent year, as well as their longest dura-
tion of continuous use (episode of use) in that window.
Covariates
Based on a literature review, we selected covariates that
may be confounders of the association between PPI use and
dementia
risk,
including
demographic
characteristics,
health behaviors, comorbidities, functional measures, and
medications.7,9,10 Information about covariates came from
standardized questionnaires administered at each study visit
and from health plan electronic databases. Demographic
characteristics included age at study entry, sex, and years
of education. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from
measured weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared.27 Participants were asked about smoking, self-
rated health, and exercise. Regular exercise was defined as
15 minutes of activity or more at least three times a
week.28 We ascertained presence of medication-treated
hypertension and diabetes mellitus (computerized phar-
macy data), history of stroke (self-report or diagnosis codes
from electronic databases), and coronary heart disease
(self-report of prior myocardial infarction, coronary artery
bypass graft, angioplasty, or angina pectoris). Depressive
symptoms were assessed using the short version of the Cen-
ter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.29 Number
of hospitalizations (from electronic databases) in the past
2 years was included as a proxy of health status. Func-
tional measures included gait speed (10-foot timed walk)
and self-reported difficulty with activities of daily living
(ADLs).30 Use of anticholinergic medications and NSAIDs
was ascertained from computerized pharmacy data (repre-
sented as TSDDs).21,31 APOE genotype was categorized as
presence or absence of any e4 alleles.32,33
Statistical Analyses
We used multivariable Cox regression models, with par-
ticipant age as the time scale, to estimate hazard ratios
(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associa-
tion between PPI use and incident all-cause dementia or
possible or probable AD. We modeled exposure with
cubic splines.34 Participants were followed until the earli-
est of dementia onset, disenrollment from the health plan,
or last study visit before April 30, 2014. For the AD
analysis, we censored participants at time of onset of any
non-AD dementia. Separate models were estimated for
each outcome (all-cause dementia and possible or proba-
ble AD) and exposure measure (TSDD, total duration,
longest duration of continuous use) pair. For each, we
present HR and 95% CI estimates from a minimally
adjusted model that included only age at study entry and
study cohort, as well as a primary model that included
additional adjustment for sex, years of education, BMI,
current smoking, self-rated health, regular exercise, hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, coronary heart disease,
depressive symptoms, gait speed, difficulties with ADLs,
number of recent hospitalizations, and cumulative expo-
sure (TSDDs) to NSAIDs and anticholinergic medications.
We included time-varying measures for coronary heart
disease,
stroke,
hypertension,
diabetes
mellitus,
and
medication use measured over the same time-varying 10-
year window as PPI use. Values from the ACT baseline
visit were used for all other covariates. We excluded 152
(4.4%) participants with missing covariate information
from all model estimates. We assessed proportional haz-
ards using Schoenfeld residuals.35
Sensitivity Analyses
We performed several sensitivity analyses. Interaction terms
were used to estimate separate HRs for PPI exposure accord-
ing to sex. We considered models additionally adjusted for
the Charlson Comorbidity Index36 and APOE genotype, as
well as models for the outcome of probable AD only.
All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and R version 3.3 (R Foun-
dation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
The median age of participants at study entry was 74,
90% were white, and 59% were female. People using PPIs
before study enrollment were more likely to be female,
have difficulty with ADLs, and have higher overall comor-
bidity (Table 1). Omeprazole was the most common PPI
used during the entire exposure period, including the
10 years before study entry through the end of follow-up
(Table S1). During this time, 1,061 (30.5%) participants
had at least one prescription fill for a PPI. Of PPI users,
460 (43.4%) used one to 180 TSDDs, 211 (19.9%) used
181 to 730 TSDDs, 159 (15.0%) used 731 to 1,825
TSDDs, and 231 (21.8%) used more than 1,825 TSDDs.
Of those 231, 167 (72.3%) had periods of continuous use
lasting longer than 3 years.
Participants had a mean follow-up � standard devia-
tion of 7.5 (5.0) years and accrued 26,012 person-years of
follow-up time. Of 3,484 participants, 827 (23.7%) devel-
oped dementia, of whom 670 developed possible or proba-
ble AD. Figure 1 shows the estimated hazard of dementia
for each level of exposure relative to no cumulative expo-
sure (0 TSDDs). Overall, PPI exposure was not related to
dementia risk (P = .66). As an example, the risk for specific
levels of cumulative exposure compared to no use was: 365
TSDDs (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.65–1.18), 1,095 TSDDs (HR
0.99, CI 0.75–1.30) and 1,825 TSDDs (HR 1.13, CI 0.82–
1.56). These TSDD levels represent approximately 1, 3 and
5 years of daily use respectively. When comparing specific
levels of exposure with no use, the adjusted HRs for
365, 1,095, and 1,825 TSDDs (representing a quantity of
PPI equivalent in amount to 1, 3, and 5 years of daily
use)
were
0.87
(95%
CI = 0.65–1.18),
0.99
(95%
CI = 0.75–1.30), and 1.13 (95% CI = 0.82–1.56) (Fig-
ure 1). Results were similar for AD (Figure 2; P = .77).
We found no evidence of nonproportional hazards for
estimates of interest.
We did not find a significant association between
dementia outcomes and PPI use when we examined total
duration of use either (Figure S2A,B) or longest duration
of continuous use (Figure S3A,B). Results were similar
after adjusting for comorbidity index or APOE genotype
(Table S2). Effect modification according to sex was not
detected (P = .14 for dementia, P = .15 for AD).

PPIS AND DEMENTIA RISK
249
 DISCUSSION
In this population-based cohort study of older adults, we
found that PPI use was not associated with risk of dementia
or AD. This finding was consistent across a wide range of
cumulative doses, including high levels of cumulative PPI
exposure. For example, people with PPI exposure consis-
tent with 5 years of daily use did not have an increased risk
for dementia compared with those with no use. In addition
to cumulative dose, we also failed to find an association
between duration of PPI use, including total duration and
longest duration of continuous use. No prior study has had
as-detailed information about medication exposure over an
extended period of time to examine this important issue, so
this study fills an important clinical and research gap. Find-
ings were robust in a variety of sensitivity analyses.
Our findings are in contrast to results from longitudi-
nal studies conducted in Germany and Taiwan.9–11 In a
prospective, population-based study of 3,327 individuals
from primary care clinics in Germany, PPI use was associ-
ated with greater risk of dementia (HR = 1.38, 95%
CI = 1.04–1.83) and AD (HR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.01–
2.06).9 These same investigators reported a similar magni-
tude of risk for PPI use and dementia (HR = 1.44, 95%
CI = 1.36–1.52) in a cohort study using administrative
data from a large German health insurer involving 73,679
participants.10 These studies differed in method of demen-
tia ascertainment (case finding9 vs claims data10) and
exposure assessment (self-report9 vs claims data10). Using
time-varying
methods,
both
studies
examined
risk
of
dementia over the 18 months after ascertainment of PPI
use. Lastly, PPI use was associated with greater dementia
risk (HR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.05–1.42) in a cohort study
using administrative data from the Taiwan National Insur-
ance Research Database.11
Several aspects of our study may explain the discrep-
ancy between our findings and those of these prior studies.

 We examined medication use over a much longer exposure
period than the German studies, which may be a more bio-
logically plausible timeframe for assessing this relationship
given the long latent period of dementia.37 Another differ-
ence was our study’s ability to capture cumulative PPI
exposure and duration and to examine dementia risk
across a wide range of exposure levels rather than relying
on a categorical measure of use versus no use.9,10 In our
study, participants underwent regular cognitive screening
and standardized dementia evaluations to detect incident
dementia, and thus we are able to avoid biases such as
underrecognition or under-coding of dementia that are
inherent
to
studies
based
on
administrative
claims
data.38,39 For example, people with unrecognized dementia
have more-frequent contact with the healthcare system up
to 3 years before their diagnosis, which may lead to
greater opportunities to receive prescriptions for PPIs.40
Alternatively, people being treated with PPIs for active
symptoms
may
have
more-frequent
contact
with
the
healthcare system, possibly resulting in a higher likelihood
of dementia being recognized and coded. Both of these
scenarios can lead to differential misclassification of out-
comes. Lastly, we adjusted for many confounders that
were not available in prior studies, including exercise,
BMI, functional measures, and NSAID use.
Prior studies finding a link between PPI use and demen-
tia postulated that vitamin B12 deficiency may underlie this
greater risk.9,10 By decreasing gastric acidity, PPIs may
decrease B12 absorption, leading to deficiency,15 but the
relationship between vitamin B12 deficiency and dementia is
not firmly established.41 Challenges include inaccuracies in
measuring B12 and variation across studies in operational
definitions of B12 deficiency.41 The ACT study did not
collect measures of B12 deficiency, so we cannot answer this
question directly. The prevalence of medication-induced
B12 deficiency is not known, but it is most likely to
occur with long-term gastric acid suppression therapy.15
Nonetheless, we did not observe a duration-response rela-
tionship between PPIs and dementia risk.
A few limitations should be considered when inter-
preting our results. We examined cumulative dose over a
10-year period, so we were unable to determine whether
there is a dose-response relationship (e.g., does omeprazole
40 mg/d confer more risk than 20 mg/d). Most partici-
pants in this study were of European ancestry, which may
limit generalizability. We had few users in the highest end
of our exposure range and cannot entirely exclude a mod-
estly greater risk with high cumulative use because 95%
CIs at the high exposures (e.g., >1,460 TSDDs) included
HRs as large as 1.4 or 1.5. PPIs became available over the
counter in 2003, so there could be misclassification of PPI
use. We addressed this by incorporating information about
self-reported use collected at study interviews; only 15 par-
ticipants (< 5%) reported OTC use.
In summary, our study is the first to combine rigorous
ascertainment of dementia status with computerized phar-
macy data dating back many years, which allowed us to
examine the effect of cumulative PPI use over an extended
period of time. Contrary to past studies, we did not find a
greater risk of dementia or AD with PPI use. Given the
widespread use of PPIs, these results will be of great interest
to patients and clinicians weighing risks and benefits of
long-term use of these medications. This work is an impor-
tant step in better understanding the safety of PPIs. Given
some of the conflicting findings between published studies,
further research would be helpful in large cohort studies
with careful case-finding for dementia and adequate num-
bers of long-term PPI users. Although there are other safety
concerns with long-term PPI use, results from our study do
not support that patients and clinicians should avoid these
medications because of concern about dementia risk.
