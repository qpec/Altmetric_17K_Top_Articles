Direct electrical stimulation of the human brain can elicit sensory and motor perceptions as well as recall of memories. Stimulating
higher order association areas of the lateral temporal cortex in particular was reported to activate visual and auditory memory
representations of past experiences (Penfield and Perot, 1963). We hypothesized that this effect could be used to modulate memory
processing. Recent attempts at memory enhancement in the human brain have been focused on the hippocampus and other mesial
temporal lobe structures, with a few reports of memory improvement in small studies of individual brain regions. Here, we
investigated the effect of stimulation in four brain regions known to support declarative memory: hippocampus, parahippocampal
neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal cortex. Intracranial electrode recordings with stimulation were used to assess verbal
memory performance in a group of 22 patients (nine males). We show enhanced performance with electrical stimulation in the
lateral temporal cortex (paired t-test, P = 0.0067), but not in the other brain regions tested. This selective enhancement was
observed both on the group level, and for two of the four individual subjects stimulated in the temporal cortex. This study
shows that electrical stimulation in specific brain areas can enhance verbal memory performance in humans.

Introduction
Deficits in memory and cognition present a major thera-
peutic challenge in a wide spectrum of brain disorders
(Harrison and Owen, 2001). There is a need for new
approaches to cognitive enhancement that would target
specific brain regions and thus overcome limitations of cur-
rent pharmacological and behavioural therapies (Sahakian
et al., 2015). Electrical stimulation of discrete areas in the
brain has been applied to a range of neurological and
neuropsychiatric disorders without a clear understanding
of
how
it
modulates
electrophysiological
activities
(Johnson et al., 2013), and little is known specifically
about the effect of direct electrical stimulation of the
brain on memory. Recent studies have reported mixed ef-
fects using various approaches to stimulation in mesial tem-
poral lobe structures (Kim et al., 2016), including the
hippocampus (Coleshill et al., 2004; Suthana et al., 2012;
Fell et al., 2013; Jacobs et al., 2016), entorhinal cortex
(Suthana et al., 2012; Fell et al., 2013; Jacobs et al.,
2016), and fornix (Hamani et al., 2008; Miller et al.,
2015). Positive effects reported in these studies were
observed either in a single case study (Hamani et al.,
2008) or on the level of a group of patients stimulated in
a specific brain region (Suthana et al., 2012; Miller et al.,
2015). All of these studies investigated different memory
functions using a variety of spatial and non-spatial tasks
in patient population presenting a range of cognitive
performances.
In this study we aimed to compare the effect of direct
brain stimulation on memory performance in four brain
regions
supporting
declarative
memory
(Eichenbaum,
2000), including two regions outside of the mesial temporal
lobe: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lateral temporal
cortex. Direct electrical stimulation of the lateral temporal
cortex was previously shown to evoke multi-sensory experi-
ence of past events (Penfield and Perot, 1963), but was not
explored in a paradigm to assess memory enhancement. We
used classic tasks for verbal memory performance (Kahana,
2012) to study the effect of stimulation on memory in in-
dividual patients and across groups of patients stimulated
in the four brain regions.
Materials and methods
The effect of stimulation on memory performance was inves-
tigated in epilepsy patients undergoing evaluation for resective
surgery with intracranial subdural and depth electrode arrays
in multiple cortical and subcortical brain regions. In this study
we focused on 22 patients implanted in the four brain regions
(Table 1) of the cortical-hippocampal declarative memory
system (Eichenbaum, 2000). Basic clinical information together
with the epilepsy pathology and verbal memory performance is
summarized in Table 1. Following implantation, each patient
participated in delayed free-recall memory tasks. The tasks
were based on classic paradigms for probing verbal memory
(Kahana, 2012), in which subjects learned lists of words for
subsequent recall (Fig. 1A). Subjects were instructed to study
lists of individual words presented sequentially on a laptop
computer screen for a later memory test. Each word remained
on the screen for 1600 ms, followed by a random jitter of 750–
1000 ms blank interval between stimuli. Immediately following
the final word in each list, participants performed a distractor
task (20 s) consisting of a series of arithmetic problems.
Following the distractor task participants were given 30 s to
verbally recall as many words as possible from the list in any
order. Each session consisted of 25 lists of this encoding-dis-
tractor-recall procedure.
Electrical stimulation was applied between pairs of adjacent
electrode contacts in the specific brain regions during encoding
of words for subsequent recall (Fig. 1A), using a fixed set of
parameters (Table 1 and Supplementary material) taken from a
recent report of memory enhancement (Suthana et al., 2012).
Only the amplitude parameter was varied within a fixed
narrow range with respect to other clinical factors related to
safety and patient treatment. Each patient was stimulated in
one to two brain targets and here we focused on the targets
localized in the four brain regions of the declarative memory
system. Specific electrodes in the target brain region were se-
lected based on the previously described subsequent memory
effect (Kahana, 2006; Sederberg et al., 2007) in the high
gamma range (Supplementary material). Safe current ampli-
tude for stimulation was determined for the chosen electrodes
in a pre-test evaluation of after-discharges (Supplementary ma-
terial). At least two stimulation sessions in one of the four
brain regions studied were required to be included in the
data analysis (Table 1) to ensure adequate number of samples
to estimate mean performance on the non-stimulated lists
(n 4 5 lists). Additional data from single stimulation sessions
were also compared as well as subset of data from stimulation
of the language-dominant hemisphere (Supplementary mater-
ial). In the studied group of 22 subjects there were seven sti-
mulated in the parahippocampal region, six stimulated in the
hippocampus, four stimulated in the temporal cortex, six sti-
mulated in the prefrontal cortex, with one subject stimulated
in two of these regions (Table 1). The number of sessions
performed with each patient was determined by the length of
seizure monitoring (range �2–14 days) and willingness to par-
ticipate in the study. The stimulation sessions were preceded
by at least two record-only control sessions with no stimula-
tion to familiarize subjects with the tasks and reduce potential
learning effects. Subjects were instructed about the stimulation
procedure but were blinded to the location of the stimulation
site. Before starting any stimulation session the experimenter

 ensured that there were no after-discharges and no subjective
experience of the stimulation.
All
statistical
tests
were
performed
in
MATLAB
(MathWorks Inc.) using built-in and custom written codes.
The effect of stimulation on memory performance in individual
subjects (Fig. 1D) was assessed using a permutation test pro-
cedure—behavioural scores from all sessions with a given
stimulation target were compared using difference in mean
from the stimulated and non-stimulated lists, which was recal-
culated after randomly shuffling the list type labels 10 000
times to obtain a distribution of the shuffled difference
scores. The permutation test was significant at P 5 0.05 level
if the original difference score without label shuffling was
higher (enhancement) or lower (impairment) than 95% of
the shuffled distribution scores. The same permutation proced-
ure was used to compare the mean score obtained from the
patients stimulated in the temporal cortex and the other brain
regions. Paired t-test was used to compare normalized mean
behavioural scores on stimulated and non-stimulated lists in
the four temporal cortex subjects. ANOVA test was used to
compare the effect of stimulating in the four studied regions on
memory performance with Tukey-Kramer post hoc compari-
son of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the means. For
more details see Supplementary material.
Results
Effect of stimulation in the lateral
temporal cortex
First, we found that stimulation in the dominant lateral
temporal neocortex of a subject with multiple stimulation
sessions (Fig. 1B) increased the number of remembered
words above the normal range, as compared to sessions
with stimulation in parahippocampal region (Fig. 1C). In
contrast to the parahippocampal region, memory perform-
ance within each session on the word lists with the tem-
poral cortex stimulation was consistently higher than
control lists without stimulation, and above the normal
range (Fig. 1C). The same subject also reported subjective
experience of improved mental ‘picturing’ of words during
the temporal cortex stimulation sessions (Supplementary
Video 1). Two of the four patients stimulated in the lateral
temporal cortex showed a positive effect on memory recall;
the other two patients showed a positive trend, which was
not observed with stimulation in a different brain region
(Fig. 1D). On the level of the whole group, memory recall
of the stimulated word lists was significantly higher (paired
t-test, P = 0.0067, Df = 3) than the non-stimulated lists
(Fig. 1E). We noticed that the stimulation had a significant
positive effect even in subjects with mild (Subject 1050) or
no (Subject 1111) verbal memory deficits, as described in
their respective neuropsychological assessments (Table 1).
Mapping stimulation sites to
electrophysiological activity
Each experimental session comprised 20 lists with stimula-
tion and five without (Fig. 1). Stimulation was applied
during presentation of two consecutive words, followed
by presentation of two other words without any stimula-
tion to enable electrophysiological analysis without stimu-
lus artefact. No difference in recall between stimulated
words
and
the
non-stimulated
words
(paired
t-test,
P = 0.37,
n = 4,
Df = 3)
on
the
stimulation
lists
was
observed (Supplementary Fig. 1) but the behavioural en-
hancement was observed on the level of the entire lists.
This suggests that the positive effect of stimulation lasted
beyond the period of electrical current administration
(4.6 s) and modulated encoding of the entire stimulation
list. To investigate this behavioural modulation further,
we mapped spectral activities in the electrophysiological
recordings induced during encoding of word lists (Fig. 2A
and B). We focused on high gamma activities (62–118 Hz),
which were previously associated with cognitive processing
in humans (Kucewicz et al., 2014) and are known to

 predict
successful
memory
encoding
(Kahana,
2006;
Sederberg et al., 2007). In this post hoc analysis, we
found that the stimulation sites in the left lateral temporal
cortex were localized in close proximity to discrete foci of
induced high gamma response to word presentation in
Subjects 1050 and 1111 (Fig. 2B and C). The exact loca-
tion of these high gamma response foci in the temporal
cortex were subject-specific and not observed in Subjects
1176 and 1177. The high gamma activity foci were
not only specific to the language-dominant hemisphere
(Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2), suggesting activation
of a widespread network engaged in these verbal memory
tasks. They were not observed in proximity to the stimula-
tion
sites
in
the
other
three
brain
areas
studied
(Supplementary Fig. 2). The four patients were all stimu-
lated in the left lateral temporal cortex that was language
dominant (Table 2), although Subject 1050 was determined
to have bilateral language localization by Wada testing
(Table 1).
To assess the effect of temporal cortex stimulation on the
spectral power, we used power across multiple frequency
bands as features for a classifier (Supplementary material)
to investigate further whether the amplitude and frequency
parameters could potentially be adjusted for individual
patients stimulated in the temporal cortex. To do this we
used the same target electrode to test a range of parameters
in an additional experiment during quiet wakefulness out-
side of the task. The fixed parameters that we used in the
memory tasks (50 Hz, 1.0–1.5 mA), taken from the previ-
ous study (Suthana et al., 2012), were found to be optimal
for only one of the four patients (Subject 1111) stimulated
in the temporal cortex (Supplementary Fig. 3). In two of
the four patients, higher frequencies (Subject 1050) or
lower amplitudes (Subject 1177) were predicted to exert a
greater effect on spectral power modulation and potentially
on behavioural performance (not investigated in this study)
than the fixed frequency and range of amplitude param-
eters used to assess the effect on memory encoding in this
study. This suggests that stimulation patterns could be opti-
mized to improve the modulatory effect on electrophysio-
logical activity and memory performance.
Effect of stimulation across four
regions of the human declarative
memory system
Finally, we tested whether the behavioural effect of stimu-
lation was specific to the lateral temporal cortex by com-
paring it to experiments with stimulating electrodes in one
of
the
other
three
brain
regions
studied
(Fig.
3A).
Stimulation had a different effect on memory performance
across
the
brain
regions
(ANOVA
test,
P = 0.0019,
F = 7.31, Df = 22). The temporal cortex group was differ-
ent from the other three brain regions stimulated (P 5 0.05
Tukey post hoc comparison of 95% CI), showing the only
positive effect on memory performance (Fig. 3B). The re-
maining three groups were not significantly different from
each other. The same pattern was confirmed when data
from patients, who completed only one session, were
included in this analysis, or when data from patients sti-
mulated in the non-dominant hemisphere were excluded
(Supplementary Fig. 4)—only the temporal cortex stimula-
tion group had a positive effect on verbal memory perform-
ance. Probability of obtaining a more positive mean effect
using combinations of four randomly drawn scores from all
23 obtained was significantly below chance (permutation
test, P = 0.0003) even when including the data with pa-
tients
who
completed
only
one
session
(P = 0.005;
Supplementary material).
Discussion
Our findings show evidence that direct brain stimulation in
the dominant lateral temporal cortex can enhance verbal
memory in patients. Previous studies, which predominantly
stimulated targets in the mesial temporal lobe structures,
reported positive and negative effects in other verbal and
non-verbal memory tasks (Suthana and Fried, 2014; Kim
et al., 2016). Here we focused on a specific task for verbal

 short-term memory given evidence from stimulation map-
ping studies, which suggested involvement of this region in
the semantic brain network (Ojemann et al., 1989; Tune
and Asaridou, 2016). This region also overlaps with the
cortical area mapped with sites where conscious memory
experience was elicited in epilepsy patients (Penfield and
Perot, 1963). Stimulation sites in our study were localized
around the dominant middle temporal gyrus, which is asso-
ciated with processing of semantic information (Binder
et al., 2009). Therefore, this brain region presents a
viable target for exploring verbal memory enhancement.
Its role in other non-verbal forms of declarative memory
functions is not clear.
We found distinct areas within this region where word
encoding induced high gamma activity, which may indicate
more precise localization of information processing and
thus map potential target sites for stimulation in this and
possibly other regions in the temporal cortex. This activity
was observed both in the language dominant and non-dom-
inant hemispheres, and beyond the areas mapped during
cortical stimulation mapping of language functions per-
formed in a subset of patients. Hence, it is unlikely to be
a biomarker of only verbal information processing in these
tasks. High frequency activity in the gamma bands and
above was previously associated with cognitive processing
in
human
memory
tasks
in
general
(Kahana,
2006;
Lachaux et al., 2012; Kucewicz et al., 2014) and proposed
to reflect the underlying activity of neuronal assemblies.
Modulation of this activity with direct electrical stimulation
presents one possible mechanism of the reported memory
enhancement effect. In the current study, patients that were
stimulated in the dominant lateral temporal cortex showed
a positive modulation of memory performance. None of the
patients were stimulated in the non-dominant temporal
cortex, so it is not possible from our current data to deter-
mine if memory enhancement is possible with non-domin-
ant temporal lobe stimulation. In the future, it would be
ideal to incorporate a priori knowledge about the localiza-
tion of language function when choosing the target stimu-
lation areas activated in the tasks.
However, even with direct access of the implanted elec-
trodes to the brain, understanding the electrophysiological
effects of the stimulating current propagated over the cor-
tical surface remains a major challenge (Borchers et al.,
2012). Hence, it is currently not known whether stimulat-
ing in the focus or perimeter of the foci of high gamma
activity, on the gyrus or sulcus, from a depth and subdural
surface electrode contact, or with different parameters
would alter the reported effects. Ours as well as other
stimulation studies with this patient population are re-
stricted to a limited range of targets and parameters that
can be explored, which is dictated by the clinical factors
like the areas of epileptogenic or after-discharge activities.
Nevertheless, we observed significant memory enhancement
in subjects stimulated in proximity of the induced high
gamma activity, providing a possible biomarker for the
choice of target stimulation sites.
The mechanism of the stimulation’s effect on electro-
physiological activity and memory recall remains to be
explored further. Direct brain stimulation is not necessarily
the most appropriate technique for studying these mechan-
isms since it is thought to preferentially activate neuronal
axons rather than cell bodies (Perlmutter and Mink, 2006)
and thus exert effects across a whole network of local and
distal brain connections. Hence, it is possible that the tem-
poral cortex stimulation worked by activating a hub of the
semantic brain network rather than a single brain region
(Kim et al., 2016). This hypothesis can be tested in animal
models combining other techniques such as mapped cal-
cium imaging exemplified in a study of micro-stimulation
in rats, which showed a wide-spread activation of sparse
assemblies of connected neurons instead of local popula-
tions surrounding the stimulating electrode (Histed et al.,
2009). Current human studies are limited to standard clin-
ical macro-electrode contacts (1–10 mm2), which are sepa-
rated
by
5–10 mm.
Using
depth
or
subdural
surface
electrode contacts is another factor that may influence the
modulatory effect of stimulation on neural activities. The
spatial scale in either of these two electrode types is un-
likely to be optimal for recording, stimulating and modu-
lating neuronal assemblies underlying memory encoding
and recall. We speculate that future studies utilizing high
spatial resolution electrode arrays will advance the field
(Worrell et al., 2012).
Figure 3 Stimulation-induced memory enhancement is
specific to the temporal cortex. (A) Localization of four
stimulation sites in the middle temporal cortex gyrus (red), which is
highlighted with white lining, and 19 other sites tested (black)
visualized in a unified transparent brain surface. (B) Stimulation
enhances memory performance in the four subjects stimulated in
the temporal cortex (TC; red bars; each bar is one subject) as
compared to the other brain areas studied (PH = parahippocampal
region; HP = hippocampus; PF = prefrontal cortex). Tukey-Kramer
post hoc ANOVA comparison (right side) shows that temporal
cortex means are significantly higher than parahippocampal region,
hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (P 5 0.05). Notice that only the
temporal cortex group shows a positive effect of stimulation.

 Despite these mechanistic limitations, our study advances
the field in several important aspects. First of all, this col-
laborative project overcomes the limit of small number of
patients studied in the previous reports of memory en-
hancement (n 5 6) from individual research groups (Kim
et al., 2016), making our larger dataset from multiple
sites more reproducible. Second, we were able to test the
effects of stimulation across four different brain regions.
Lastly, the positive effect of stimulation was reported in
individual patients tested across multiple days of stimula-
tion sessions, on the level of the group of patients stimu-
lated in the temporal cortex, and between the four groups
stimulated in different brain regions. Previous studies re-
ported the positive effects either as a single case study
(Hamani et al., 2008), or as a group effect without a sig-
nificant enhancement in individual patients (Suthana et al.,
2012) or without statistical evaluation (Miller et al., 2015).
All of these studies including ours are limited to the number
of patients available, variable clinical aspects in this patient
population like individual case pathologies, medication and
cognitive comorbidities, which need to be addressed by fur-
ther increasing the number of subjects and assessing the
effect of baseline deficits in verbal memory functions.
Animal model studies are required to address these chal-
lenges. The other remaining issue in the field is elucidating
the nature of cognitive processes modulated by the stimu-
lation. The stimulation could enhance memory processing
per se, or an associated process like attention and percep-
tion. Both have been proposed for possible functions of
gamma oscillations (Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand, 1999;
Jensen et al., 2007), and all of these processes would con-
tribute to the probability of recall. At this point it is not
known whether the positive effect of stimulation in this
brain region could generalize to other verbal and non-
verbal memory functions, and whether stimulation in the
non-dominant hemisphere would have a different effect.
Addressing these and other issues associated with direct
brain stimulation for memory enhancement can potentially
translate into clinical practice. For instance, the finding that
electrical stimulation in the middle dominant temporal
gyrus can enhance memory processes might provide a
hint as to why some patients undergoing surgical removal
of this region complain about verbal memory deficits.
Knowledge about patient-specific brain areas involved in
verbal memory processing can be used to guide resection
surgery
or
promote
alternative
stimulation
therapies.
Finally, the reported memory enhancement effect may be
particularly useful for developing new stimulation treat-
ments for restoring memory functions and thus be applied
in the emerging brain–machine interface technologies to
treat memory and cognitive functions in humans.
