BACKGROUND: Increasing vaccination of pregnant women makes it important to assess safety 
events potentially linked to prenatal vaccination. This study investigates the association 
between prenatal tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination and autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of mother-child pairs with deliveries January 
1, 2011 to December 31, 2014 at Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals. Maternal 
Tdap vaccination from pregnancy start to delivery date was obtained from electronic 
medical records. A diagnosis of ASD was obtained by using International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision codes. Children were managed from birth to first ASD 
diagnosis, end of membership, or end of follow-up (June 30, 2017). Cox proportional hazards 
models estimated the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the association 
between maternal Tdap vaccination and ASD, with inverse probability of treatment 
weighting to adjust for confounding.
RESULTS: Women vaccinated were more likely to be Asian American or Pacific Islander, be 
nulliparous, have a higher education, receive influenza vaccination prenatally, and give 
birth at term. ASD was diagnosed in 1341 (1.6%) children, and the incidence rate was 
3.78 per 1000 person years in the Tdap exposed and 4.05 per 1000 person years in the 
unexposed group (HR: 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.88–1.09). The inverse probability 
of treatment weighting–adjusted analyses revealed that prenatal Tdap vaccination was not 
associated with an increased ASD risk (HR: 0.85, 95% confidence interval: 0.77–0.95).
CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal Tdap vaccination was not associated with an increased ASD risk. We 
support recommendations to vaccinate pregnant women to protect infants, who are at 
highest risk of death after pertussis infection.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Few researchers have 
examined effects of prenatal tetanus, diphtheria, and 
acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination on maternal and 
child outcomes. No increased risk of preterm delivery or 
low birth weight has been found in infants born to women 
vaccinated prenatally.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Prenatal Tdap vaccination was 
not associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) in children. No study to our knowledge has 
been published examining the risk of ASD after prenatal 
exposure to the Tdap vaccine.

 Prenatal tetanus toxoid, reduced 
diphtheria toxoid, and acellular 
pertussis, adsorbed (Tdap) 
vaccination has been shown to be 
effective in protecting vulnerable 
young infants from pertussis. 
Prompted by waning immunity, 
pertussis incidence has risen in the 
past decade in the United States, with 
peaks in 2010 and 2014.1, 
 
2  
Young infants are at the highest 
risk of hospitalization and death 
after pertussis infection, a highly 
contagious respiratory disease 
(whooping cough) caused by the 
bacterium Bordetella pertussis.3 
In response, in October 2011 
the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
recommended that unvaccinated 
pregnant women receive the Tdap 
vaccine after 20 weeks’ gestation.4 
Given the seriousness of the matter, 
this recommendation was amended 
in October 2012 to include all 
pregnant women regardless of 
previous vaccinations, and the 
optimal vaccination period was 
defined between 27 and 36 weeks’ 
gestation.5 Evidence revealed that 
antibodies are passed along to 
newborns, and the vaccine was 
91.4% effective in providing some 
immunity until newborns reach 
2 months of age, the age they are 
expected to receive their first dose 
of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular 
pertussis vaccine.6, 
 
7 Given the 
increasing practice to vaccinate 
pregnant women with Tdap, it is 
important to address the concern of 
a potential link between maternal 
vaccination and subsequent 
development of autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) in children.
During a time when Tdap was not 
routinely recommended for pregnant 
women, spontaneous abortions were 
the most frequent pregnancy-specific 
adverse events (16.7%) reported in 
the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting 
System, a national database used for 
monitoring the safety of vaccines in 
the population.8 However, the number 
of pregnant women who received the 
vaccine was small (n = 132) and likely 
a selective group because the vaccine 
was not in routine use. Since the 
ACIP recommendations, researchers 
have examined the effects of the 
Tdap vaccine on maternal and child 
outcomes finding no associations 
between the vaccine and adverse 
events.9 
– 
11 A study based on data from 
7 Vaccine Safety Datalink sites found 
that there was no increased risk of 
small for gestational age, preterm 
delivery, or low birth weight in infants 
born to women who received the 
vaccine while pregnant between 2007 
and 2013.9
Researchers examining maternal 
and child outcomes after prenatal 
Tdap vaccination have not evaluated 
longer-term outcomes such as 
the risk of ASD, an outcome of 
significant public interest. ASD is 
a neurodevelopmental disorder 
typically diagnosed in early childhood 
and characterized by impairments 
in social-communication skills and 
restricted stereotyped behaviors.12 
In the United States, ∼147 per 10 000 
children are diagnosed with ASD by 8 
years of age.13, 
 
14 Although there is no 
consensus on timing of exposure, the 
prenatal period is strongly implicated 
in ASD etiology, 
15 
– 
18 and both 
genetic and environmental causes 
are important.19 
–21 Although there 
is consistent evidence supporting 
that vaccines administered in 
childhood and their preservatives do 
not cause ASD, 
22 
– 
24 there is limited 
research on the safety of vaccines 
administered during pregnancy. In 
this study, we aimed to evaluate the 
association between the Tdap vaccine 
administered during pregnancy 
and ASD risk in a cohort of children 
born at Kaiser Permanente Southern 
California (KPSC) hospitals.
METHODS
Study Population and Design
In this retrospective cohort study, 
we observed the outcome of an 
ASD diagnosis in children born 
at all KPSC hospitals between 
January 1, 2011, and December 31, 
2014. KPSC is an integrated health 
care delivery organization that 
provides health care in 15 hospitals 
and ∼220 medical offices to ∼4.4 
million members who are broadly 
representative of the Southern 
California population.25 KPSC uses 
electronic medical records (EMRs) 
to integrate medical information, 
such as diagnosis and immunizations. 
All recommended immunizations 
are free to members regardless of 
copayment status. This study was 
approved by the KPSC Institutional 
Review Board, which waived the 
requirement for informed consent.
Eligibility was restricted to pregnant 
women who did not have assisted 
conceptions (in vitro fertilization) 
and gave birth to live singleton 
infants at 22 to 45 weeks’ gestation. 
Childrens' medical records were 
linked longitudinally to biological 
mothers by using unique identifiers. 
Maternal and child pairs were 
included if pregnant women had 
continuous membership since the 
beginning of pregnancy (allowing 
for a ≤31-day gap) and infants were 
members for at least 90 continuous 
days after turning 1 year of age. 
Pairs were excluded if children were 
diagnosed with chromosomal or 
congenital anomalies.
Maternal Tdap Vaccination
Maternal vaccination captured in the 
EMR was defined as receipt of Tdap 
anytime during pregnancy (yes, no), 
from the pregnancy start date to the 
day before the delivery date. The 
pregnancy start date was calculated 
by subtracting the gestational age 
at birth from the child’s birth date. 
Adacel (Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, 
PA) was the primary Tdap product 
used at KPSC facilities during the 
study period.26 The unvaccinated 
group was defined by women 
who were not vaccinated with

 Tdap anytime during their entire 
pregnancy.
ASDs
ASD was defined by a clinical 
diagnosis any time after turning 
1 year of age recorded in the EMR 
between January 1, 2012, and June 
30, 2017 (International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes: 
299.0, 299.8, 299.9; and International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision codes: F84.0, F84.5, F84.8, 
F84.9). Although we consider 
children at risk for ASD from birth, 
we restricted the minimum diagnosis 
age on the basis of the 12-month 
minimum allowable evaluation age 
of the Autism Diagnostic Observation 
Schedule, the gold standard 
diagnostic instrument for identifying 
ASD.27
Covariates
Maternal and child characteristics 
were obtained from the EMR. Child 
data included sex (male or female), 
birth year (2011–2014), birth 
season (winter, spring, summer, fall), 
gestational age at birth (mean, SD; 
<37 or ≥37 weeks’ gestation), and 
birth weight (mean, SD). Maternal 
data at delivery included maternal 
age (≤25, 26–30, 31–34, ≥35 
years), race and/or ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic African 
American, Hispanic, non-Hispanic 
Asian American or Pacific Islander, 
other or multiracial, unknown), 
primary language (English, other), 
interpreter needed (yes, no), 
educational attainment (less than 
or equal to high school, some 
college, bachelor’s degree, greater 
than or equal to master’s degree, 
unknown), and medical center of 
delivery. Additional pregnancy 
information included Medicaid 
insurance (yes, no), parity (0, 1, 
≥2), receipt of influenza vaccine 
during pregnancy (yes, no), start of 
prenatal care (≤3 months gestation, 
>3 months gestation, no care or 
missing), and medical and obstetrical 
complications (pregestational 
hypertension, preeclampsia or 
eclampsia, pregestational and 
gestational diabetes, placenta previa, 
and placental abruption).
Statistical Analysis
The distributions of maternal and 
child characteristics by prenatal Tdap 
vaccination status and either χ2 test 
or Student’s t test for differences 
in characteristics were calculated. 
Follow-up characteristics, age of ASD 
diagnosis, and the incidence rate of 
ASD diagnosis by Tdap vaccination 
status were calculated. Children 
were followed from birth to first ASD 
diagnosis, end of membership in the 
health plan, or the end of the study 
follow-up period (June 30, 2017), 
whichever came first.
To assess the potential concern that 
ASD diagnoses were missed because 
of dual enrollment in another health 
care system and/or limited health 
care use within the KPSC system, 
we also calculated the proportion 
of children with no outpatient 
encounters after turning 1 year of 
age. Proportions were calculated by 
whether their mothers received the 
Tdap vaccine during pregnancy.
Cox proportional hazards regression 
was used to estimate the unadjusted 
and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) 
and their 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) to evaluate the magnitude 
of association between maternal 
Tdap vaccination and ASD diagnosis 
in children. To evaluate potential 
variations in results, we also 
conducted stratified analyses by 
child’s birth year and by assessing 
results among women giving birth 
to their first child (nulliparous). We 
used propensity score analyses with 
inverse probability of treatment 
weighting (IPTW) to adjust for 
potential confounding. First, we 
used a logistic regression model 
including variables associated with 
vaccination a priori, 
28, 
 
29 or variables 
from bivariate results (P < .05) that 
could reasonably affect Tdap receipt, 
to estimate the probability of Tdap 
vaccination. The following variables 
were included: child’s birth year, 
gestational age at birth (<37 or ≥37 
weeks’ gestation), maternal age, 
race and/or ethnicity, education, 
medical center of delivery, Medicaid 
insurance, parity, start of prenatal 
care, and influenza vaccination 
during pregnancy. Second, the weight 
for each mother was calculated 
as the inverse of her predicted 
probability of Tdap exposure and 
was normalized by dividing by the 
mean weight of each exposure group. 
Standardized difference scores were 
used to assess whether balance of 
covariates was achieved between 
the comparison groups. Unlike P 
values, for which the magnitude 
is highly related to the sample 
size, standardized difference is a 
unified approach to quantifying the 
magnitude of difference between 
groups regardless of sample size; an 
absolute value <0.10 is considered a 
negligible difference.30, 
 
31
RESULTS
There were 109 536 women who 
had continuous enrollment since 
the beginning of pregnancy with 
nonassisted conceptions and gave 
birth to live singletons between 
January 1, 2011, and December 
31, 2014. Of these, 94 400 (86.2%) 
children were enrolled by 1 year of 
age. After excluding an additional 
9356 (8.5%) children with <90 days 
of continuous enrollment and 3051 
(2.8%) diagnosed with chromosomal 
or congenital anomalies, the study 
included 81 993 children (Fig 1).
Prenatal Tdap vaccination coverage 
ranged from 26% (5407 of 20 553) 
for the 2012 birth cohort to 79% 
(16 882 of 21 433) for the 2014 
birth cohort. The mean and median 
gestational age at vaccination was 
28 weeks (SD: 7.4) and 29 weeks, 
respectively (interquartile range: 
26–33 weeks). Women vaccinated 
during pregnancy were more likely to

 be Asian American or Pacific Islander, 
have a bachelor’s degree or higher, 
be nulliparous, have received the 
influenza vaccine prenatally, and give 
birth at term (≥37 weeks’ gestation) 
compared with unvaccinated women 
(Table 1).
The follow-up time ranged between 
1.2 and 6.5 years and was on 
average longer in the unvaccinated 
group (Table 2). There was an 
average difference of 6 months in 
follow-up time between both groups 
(unvaccinated, mean: 4.44 years [SD: 
1.18]; vaccinated, mean: 3.85 years 
[SD: 1.29]). Approximately 15% of 
children in the unvaccinated and 
13% in the vaccinated group did not 
have complete follow-up through 
the end of the study because of 
termination of KPSC membership. 
ASD was diagnosed in 1341 children 
(1.6%). The proportion of children 
with ASD across birth years revealed 
a decline from 2.0% to 1.5% in the 
unvaccinated and 1.8% to 1.2% 
in the vaccinated group. Among 
children diagnosed with ASD, the first 
diagnosis commonly occurred at 2 
years of age in either of the exposure 
groups (44%) followed by diagnoses 
at ages 3 and 4 years. Among children 
diagnosed with ASD before age 2 
(n = 213), 93.5% of children had 
a second confirmatory diagnosis 
after age 2 years. Among children of 
unvaccinated mothers and children 
of vaccinated mothers, there were 
187 (0.44%) and 126 (0.32%) 
children, respectively, who did not 
have an outpatient encounter after 1 
year of age.
The ASD incidence rate was  
3.78 per 1000 person-years  
in the Tdap vaccinated and 4.05 
per 1000 person-years in the 
unvaccinated group (Table 3).  
The unadjusted HR was 0.98  
(95% CI: 0.88–1.09). After  
propensity score weighting,  
the standardized difference scores 
were <0.1 for all variables, suggesting 
a good balance of covariates (Fig 2).  
The IPTW-adjusted analyses showed 
that Tdap vaccination during 
pregnancy was not associated with 
increased ASD risk (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 
0.77–0.95). Results were consistent 
across study birth years and among 
nulliparous women.
DISCUSSION
In this large retrospective 
observational cohort study  
of 81 993 pairs of diverse pregnant 
women and their children,  
we found no evidence of increased  
risk for ASD diagnosis associated 
with Tdap vaccination during 
pregnancy. Subanalyses supported 
the overall results, revealing  
minimal variability by year of  
birth and parity. No study to  
our knowledge has been published 
with results examining the risk  
of ASD after maternal exposure  
to the Tdap vaccine.
Maternal immune activation 
during pregnancy is hypothesized 
to indirectly affect fetal 
neurodevelopment.32

 including prolonged episodes of fever 
to increase autism risk, hypothesizing 
that maternal infections, cytokine 
responses, and proinflammatory 
pathways are likely to alter fetal 
brain development.32, 
 
36 
– 
41 Our results 
potentially indicate that the maternal 
Tdap vaccine affects immune 
trajectories protecting infants against 
infections that would otherwise lead 
to neurodevelopmental alterations. 
Alternatively, vaccinations during 
pregnancy can possibly activate the 
maternal immune system leading 
to neurodevelopmental insults. 
However, except for 1 study in 
which the association between the 
influenza vaccine during pregnancy 
and ASD was examined, 
42 there is 
an insufficient number of studies 
that contain examinations of this 
hypothesis.
Only a handful of researchers 
have investigated adverse events 
potentially associated with Tdap 
receipt during pregnancy that may 
point to possible intermediate 
physiologic pathways to ASD. Two 
studies at sites participating in the 
Vaccine Safety Datalink project 
and a third study of >1 million 
pregnant women revealed a small but 
statistically significant increased risk 
of chorioamnionitis after maternal 
Tdap vaccination (6.1% in vaccinated, 
5.5% in unvaccinated).43 
– 
46 
Although Tdap increased the risk for 
chorioamnionitis, the investigators 
in the referenced studies found that 
the resulting chorioamnionitis was 
not associated with a preterm birth, a 
potential risk factor for ASD.47 Given 
that maternal Tdap vaccination alone 
or mediated by chorioamnionitis did 
not translate to a preterm birth or 
any clinically relevant adverse event 
in newborns, 
9, 
 
46 a direct or mediated 
relationship between maternal Tdap 
and ASD is not supported.
Our findings have some strengths 
and limitations. ASD was determined 
by recorded diagnoses in the EMR  
and was not validated by a study- 
specific standardized assessment.

 In addition, misclassification of 
ASD diagnosis could have occurred 
among children with dual insurance 
or limited health care use, if they 
sought care for ASD elsewhere. 
However, incident ASD diagnoses 
were likely captured consistently 
during most of the study years 
because of a California law enacted 
in 2012 (Senate Bill 946) requiring 
health plans to cover ASD-associated 
health costs, such as diagnostic and 
behavioral health treatment, 
48  
prompting the implementation of 
systematic procedures for screening 
and diagnosing within the KPSC 
health care system. Thus, a diagnosis 
of ASD can only be made by qualified 
mental health professionals (child 
and/or adolescent psychiatrists, 
developmental and/or behavioral 
pediatricians, child psychologists, 
or neurologists). In addition, the 
combined prevalence of ASD in 
this study was 1.6%, comparable 
to the estimated 1.7% prevalence 
among 8-year-old children reported 
in the United States.49 In addition, 
vaccinated and unvaccinated women 
may be different in aspects that 
may also be associated with ASD 
diagnosis. Because study follow-up 
time was dependent on the child’s 
birth year, children in this study had 
different opportunities for receiving 
an ASD diagnosis (ie, children born 
in 2011 had maximum follow-up 
potential of 5.5–6.5 years, whereas 
children born in 2014 had 2.5–3.5 
years). Based on US representative 
data, 3 to 5 years of age is the period 
when most children with an ASD 
are diagnosed.50 Thus, we likely did 
not capture some children with ASD 
born in later study years considering 
that some children with milder 
ASD would not be diagnosed until 
they reach school age. Similarly, 
maternal Tdap vaccine uptake varied 
by birth year because of evolving 
ACIP recommendations and pertussis 
epidemics in California.2, 
51, 
 
52  
However, because we identified 
minimal variability in study results 
when stratifying by birth year, 
these variations likely did not affect 
our results. In addition, although 
we controlled for major known 
confounding factors related to Tdap 
vaccination and ASD, our results 
could have been affected by residual 
confounding, such as behavioral or 
clinical factors not captured by the 
EMR. For example, we did not control 
for having an older sibling with ASD, 
although the sibling recurrence  
risk is between 10% and 20%, a  
10- to 20-fold increase over the 
general population’s prevalence.53, 
 
54  
However, in our analysis restricted 
to mothers giving birth to their first 
child, the results were consistent 
with overall findings.
Our study has additional strengths. 
Maternal Tdap vaccination  
and ASD information was not 
subject to recall bias, and our 
weighting procedures enabled  
us to balance the Tdap exposed  
and unexposed groups to  
compare 2 populations that  
were comparable in important

 measured confounding factors.  
In addition, we included  
children diagnosed with ASD 
starting at 1 year of age in 
consideration of the latest  
evidence in ASD screening 
and diagnosis research and 
practice.55 
– 
57 Still, we were  
able to confirm that the majority 
(>93%) of children with their  
first diagnosis of ASD before age 
2 also had a diagnosis after age 2, 
which aligns with the American 
Academy of Pediatrics autism 
screening recommended schedule 
of 18- and 24-months.58
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that getting 
vaccinated with Tdap during 
pregnancy is not associated with an 
increased risk of ASD in children. 
Future studies with additional 
birth years and longer follow-up 
can add to the scientific evidence 
about Tdap vaccination during 
pregnancy and ASD in offspring. 
We provide evidence supporting 
the ACIP’s recommendation to 
vaccinate pregnant women to protect 
vulnerable infants, who are at highest 
risk of hospitalization and death after 
pertussis infection.
