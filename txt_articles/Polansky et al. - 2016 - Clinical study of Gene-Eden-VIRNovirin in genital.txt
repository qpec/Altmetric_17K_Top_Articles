Clinical study of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
in genital herpes: suppressive treatment safely 
decreases the duration of outbreaks in both 
severe and mild cases
Hanan Polansky* , Edan Itzkovitz and Adrian Javaherian
Abstract 
Background: We conducted a clinical study that tested the effect of suppressive treatment with the botanical prod-
uct Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on genital herpes. Our previous paper showed that the treatment decreased the number 
of genital herpes outbreaks without any side effects. It also showed that the clinical effects of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
are mostly better than those reported in the studies that tested acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. The current 
paper reports the effect of suppressive treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on the duration of outbreaks, in severe 
and mild genital herpes cases.
Methods: The framework was a retrospective chart review. The population included 137 participants. The treatment 
was 1–4 capsules per day. The duration of treatment was 2–48 months. The study included three controls: baseline, 
no-treatment, and dose–response.
Results: The treatment decreased the duration of outbreaks in 87 % of participants and decreased the mean dura-
tion of outbreaks from 8.77 days and 6.7 days in the control groups to 2.87 days in the treatment group (P < 0.001, 
both groups). All participants reported no adverse experiences.
Conclusions: This paper shows that suppressive treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin decreased the duration of 
genital herpes outbreaks, in both severe and mild cases, without any side effects. Based on the results reported in this 
and our previous paper, we recommend suppressive treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin as a natural alternative to 
both suppressive and episodic treatments with current drugs, in both severe and mild genital herpes cases.

Background
Genital herpes is one of the most important public health 
problems [1]. It is a sexually transmitted infection caused 
by two viruses: the Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-
2), and Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) [2]. In the 
United States, one in four persons 30 years of age or older 
has HSV-2 [3].
Three drugs are used in the treatment of genital her-
pes: acyclovir (ACV), valacyclovir (VACV, a prodrug of 
ACV), and famciclovir (FCV, a prodrug of penciclovir) 
[4, 5]. ACV was approved by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) in 1984, VACV in 1995, and FCV in 1994. 
These drugs use modified nucleosides, or their prod-
rugs [6]. The drugs inhibit the activity of the viral DNA 
polymerase, which is the main replication enzyme of the 
virus.
All three drugs are used in both episodic and sup-
pressive therapy. Episodic therapy uses short term, self-
administration of the drug during outbreaks. The main

objective of episodic therapy is to decrease the duration 
of the outbreaks [7]. Suppressive therapy involves long 
term, daily administration of the drug before the onset of 
outbreaks. The main objective of suppressive therapy is 
to decrease the number of outbreaks [8].
All three drugs are associated with known adverse 
effects. The most frequent ones, according to the prod-
uct inserts, are nausea, diarrhea, and headache, for ACV, 
headache, nausea, and abdominal pain, for VACV, and 
headache, nausea and dizziness, for FCV.
The medical literature also reports non-common 
adverse events. For instance, Yavuz et al. reported that a 
78-year-old female with normal baseline renal function, 
and no contributing possible nephrotoxic factors, devel-
oped irreversible renal dysfunction after oral ACV treat-
ment [9]. Becker et al. reported that a patient developed 
rapidly progressive acute renal failure with concomitant 
mental status changes following treatment with high-
dose parenteral ACV [10]. Another uncommon, but 
serious side effect of ACV treatment, is neurotoxicity 
that may lead to confusion, hallucinations, seizures and 
obtundation [11].
Le Cleach et al. conducted a meta-analysis of 26 clini-
cal studies that tested the effectiveness and safety of the 
three oral antiviral drugs [2]. Interestingly, they found 
that only 8 out of the 26 studies, or less than a third, 
reported the number of withdrawals due to harms. These 
8 studies reported 14 withdrawals due to harms in the 
placebo or no treatment groups, and 31 withdrawals in 
the antiviral groups. This is a 121 % increase in the num-
ber of withdrawals due to harms. In addition, only four, 
or 16 % of the 26 studies, reported safety data in the 
form of the total number of adverse events. These four 
studies reported 115 adverse events in 291 participants 
in the placebo or no treatment groups (40 %), including 
three serious adverse events, two renal signs, and one 
fatal pneumonia. In the antiviral groups, they reported 
331 adverse events in 561 participants (59 %), including 
three serious adverse events, one hypertension crisis, one 
intestinal obstruction, and one angor. In other words, 
the participants treated with the antiviral drugs reported 
48 % more adverse events relative to the non-treated or 
placebo-treated participants.
Lam et al. analyzed a cohort of 76,269 patients who 
received acyclovir or valacyclovir, and 84,646 who 
received famciclovir [12]. The results showed that 0.27 % 
of those treated with ACV or VACV, and 0.28 % of those 
treated with FCV, were hospitalized with acute kidney 
injury (AKI).
It is well accepted that adverse effects are dose-depend-
ent. Therefore, to minimize the risk of adverse effects 
whenever possible, the medical community decided 
to recommend using these drugs in short term, or epi-
sodic therapy, in mild cases, and long term, or suppres-
sive therapy, in severe cases. Clinical studies have shown 
that episodic treatment with these drugs can shorten the 
time to lesion healing by 1–2 days [13–15]. Clinical stud-
ies also showed that suppressive treatment for a period 
of 4–12 months can decrease the number of outbreaks, 
such that about half of patients remain recurrence-free, 
and the other half show a 70–80 % decrease in the fre-
quency of their outbreaks [16, 17].
It is interesting that this practice is so ingrained that it 
had a profound effect on the clinical studies that tested 
these drugs. Surprisingly, most of the clinical studies that 
tested suppressive treatments measured the effect on the 
number of outbreaks, but not their effect on the duration 
of outbreaks [7, 8, 17, 18].
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin is a patented botanical prod-
uct that consists of five natural ingredients: quercetin 
100 mg, green tea extract 150 mg, cinnamon extract 
50 mg, selenium 100 mcg, and licorice extract 25 mg. 
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin was developed to target latent 
viruses including HSV, HPV, CMV and EBV, and dimin-
ish their deleterious effect on the host, as explained by 
the Microcompetition theory [19–21].
The scientists who developed the Gene-Eden-VIR/
Novirin formula used a unique scientific tool, Computer 
Intuition, a proprietary psycholinguistic-based, data-
mining program that analyzes scientific text [22]. The 
objective was to identify natural ingredients found in 
the scientific literature that have a strong antiviral effect 
against the most common viruses. To achieve the objec-
tive, the scientists used the computer program to analyze 
more than 50,000 papers. The results assisted the devel-
opers in selecting the best ingredients and the most effec-
tive dosages.
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin was introduced in the mar-
ketplace at the end of 2009. A post-marketing clinical 
study conducted at the Center for the Biology of Chronic 
Disease (CBCD) showed that Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
is antiviral [22]. Another post-marketing clinical study 
showed that Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin safely decreased 
the feeling of fatigue in individuals infected with a latent 
virus [23].
Our previous paper showed that suppressive treatment 
with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin decreased the number of 
genital herpes outbreaks without any side effects [24]. It 
also showed that the clinical effects of Gene-Eden-VIR/
Novirin are mostly better than those reported in the 
studies that tested acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. 
The current paper tested the effect of suppressive treat-
ment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on the duration of 
outbreaks, in severe and mild genital herpes cases.

Methods
Objective
The objective of this clinical study was to test the effect 
of suppressive treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
on the duration of genital herpes outbreaks, and possi-
bly offer a suppressive treatment as an alternative to epi-
sodic treatment with current drugs in mild genital herpes 
cases.
Framework
The framework was a retrospective chart review. The 
company that sells Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin, Lilac Corp., 
provides a service to the customers who purchase the 
products. The service consists of tracking the changes 
in the customers’ health while using the products. The 
company is using a questionnaire called the Natural Ori-
gin Treatment Clinical Questionnaire (NotCiq). The data 
is collected over the phone by professional interviewers 
in a single session. The NotCiq questionnaire is a patient 
reported outcome (PRO) instrument. These sessions pro-
duced the charts that were analyzed in this study. More 
details on the NotCiq questionnaire is available in our 
previous study [22].
Randomization
A random selection of charts, collected during a 2-month 
period, October and November 2015, were analyzed. The 
2 months were randomly selected.
Treatment
The treatment was 1, 2, 3, or 4 capsules of Gene-Eden-
VIR/Novirin per day. The duration of treatment ranged 
from 2 to 48 months. The mean duration of treatment 
was 12 months.
A total of 137 participants were included in the study. 
They composed two groups. The treatment group con-
sisting of 117 participants and the no-treatment control 
group consisting of 20 participants. The study included 
three FDA recommended controls: baseline control, 
consisting of 117 participants, a no-treatment control, 
consisting of 20 participants, and a dose–response con-
current control, consisting of 99 participants. The base-
line control included participants “before” treatment, or 
pre-treatment. The no-treatment control included par-
ticipants who have purchased Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
in the last 6 weeks. The dose response concurrent control 
included 99 participants out of the treatment group.
Outcome measures
The NotCiq questionnaire for genital herpes has several 
sections: a section on gender, age, and ethnicity of the 
participants; a section on the duration of treatment, dos-
age, and adverse experiences; a section on diagnosis and 
type of symptoms; a section on the duration of outbreaks; 
and a section on symptom severity, interference with 
daily life, and pain. The questionnaire used both open- 
and closed-ended questions. The answers to the closed-
ended questions were on a scale of 1–7.
The answers to the NotCiq questionnaire were col-
lected over the phone by four independent interviewers 
who specialize in outbound call services. The interview-
ers were blinded to the objective of the study.
Efficacy
The primary efficacy end point was the duration of out-
breaks, defined as the number of days between initiation 
and complete resolution of all symptoms and signs. The 
secondary efficacy end points were the severity of symp-
toms, interference with daily life, and level of pain.
Safety
The participants’ reports of adverse events were collected 
and analyzed.
Population
Participants who were using Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin for 
other purposes, such as treatment for cancer, chronic dis-
eases, and hypertension, were excluded.
Participants concurrently taking antiviral medications, 
including ACV, VACV, or FCV, as suppressive or episodic 
treatment, were also excluded. The final list of partici-
pants consisted of 137 men and women aged ≥18 years 
with at least one genital herpes outbreak per year.
Statistical analysis
The statistical difference between the responses of pre-
treatment and post-treatment was calculated. The statis-
tical tests were performed in a then-test model for users. 
Statistical analysis was performed using a one-tail t test 
assuming unequal variances. P ≤ 0.05 was considered as 
statistically significant.
Results
Population characteristics
A total of 137 participants were included in the study. 
Table 1 summarizes the demographic and clinical charac-
teristics of these participants (Table 1).
Primary efficacy end point
Out of the 117 participants in the treatment group who 
used Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin for at least 2 months (see 
section on duration of treatment effect for explana-
tion), 102 (87 %) reported a decrease in the duration of 
outbreaks. The mean duration of outbreaks decreased 
from 8.77 to 6.70 days, in the pre-treatment and no-
treatment control groups, respectively, to 2.87 days in the

treatment group (P < 0.001 for both groups) (Table 2). 
This is a decrease of 5.9 and 3.83 days, respectively. The 
median duration of outbreaks decreased from 7.00 to 
5.00 days, in the pre-treatment and no-treatment con-
trol groups, respectively, to 2.00 days in the treatment 
group (Table 2). In 75 % of the participants, the duration 
of outbreaks decreased to less than 5 days compared to 
10.5 and 11 days in the no-treatment and pre-treatment 
groups, respectively (Fig. 1). Out of the 117 participants 
in the treatment group, 48 (41 %) reported no outbreaks.
To test the internal consistency of the participants’ 
responses, the following two questions were included: 
“How long did your symptoms last, before taking Gene-
Eden-VIR/Novirin?” and “How long did your symptoms 
last, after taking Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin?”
, using a scale 
from 1–7, where 1 is “very long time” and 7 is “didn’t

. The mean scores were 3.35 and 5.82 for 
the “before” and “after” taking Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
questions, respectively (P < 0.0001) (Table 2). The results 
showed that both measures, the one that asks the partici-
pant to count the number of days he or she experienced 
symptoms, and the one that asks to represent the duration 
of outbreaks using a scale, generated consistent results.
To test for possible differences between patients with 
a different severity level we compared the change from 
pre-treatment to post-treatment in participants who 
reported less than 6 episodes and those who reported at 
least 6 episodes per year. We compared the change (Δ) 
in the duration of outbreaks from pre-treatment to post-
treatment. No difference was detected between the two 
groups (P = 0.32; data not shown). To check for consist-
ency, we also tested this difference using the participants’ 
answers using the 1–7 scale. No difference was found in 
these answers either (P = 0.28; data not shown).
We also tested the effect of different dosages. We com-
pared the participants who took 1 capsule (N = 36) to 
those who took 2 capsules (N = 63) per day. The mean 
duration of outbreaks (in days) before treatment was 8.30 
and 8.20 days, respectively (P = 0.45). We than analyzed 
the duration of outbreaks following treatment in both 
groups. The mean duration of outbreaks decreased to 
2.94 and 1.98 days in the group that took 1 capsule and 
2 capsules, respectively (P = 0.058). These results have 
borderline significance for the existence of a dose effect. 
We could not test for a dose effect participants that took 
more than 2 capsules per day since the number of partici-
pants who took 3 or 4 capsules per day was too small for 
statistical analysis.
Finally, we also tested the effect of diagnosis. The data 
included two types of diagnosis, diagnosis by a physician, 
and self-diagnosis. The mean duration of outbreaks were 
8.65 and 2.82 days during the pre-treatment and treat-
ment period, respectively (P < 0.0001), in participants 
diagnosed by a physician, and 9.19 and 3.04 days, respec-
tively (P < 0.0001), in self-diagnosed participants. The 
decrease in duration of outbreaks in these two groups are 
5.83 and 6.15 days, respectively. There was no statistically 
significant difference between the two groups in the pre-
treatment and treatment periods (P = 0.32 and P = 0.39, 
respectively). These results show that the method of diag-
nosis has no effect.
Secondary efficacy end points
Severity of symptoms was measured on a scale from 1 to 
7, where 1 is “very bad (severe)” and 7 is “not bad at all.” 
Out of the 115 participants who reported some sever-
ity of their symptoms, 101 (88 %) reported a decrease in 
severity, and 54 (47 %) reported a complete recovery on 
the severity scale, that is a change from a score of 1–6 to 
a score of 7 on this scale. A statistical analysis showed 
that the mean score increased from 3.5 to 3.05 for the 
no-treatment and pre-treatment control groups, respec-
tively, to 5.98 for the treatment group (P < 0.0001 for 
both groups) (Table 3).
Interference of symptoms with daily life was also meas-
ured on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 is “interfered all the 
time” and 7 is “did not interfere at all.
” Out of the 59 par-
ticipants who reported some interference with their daily 
life, 52 (88 %) reported a decrease in this interference, 
and 31 (53 %) reported a complete recovery on the infer-
ence scale. A statistical analysis showed that the mean 
score increased from 3.71 to 3.20 for the no-treatment

Finally, the level of pain experienced during an out-
break was also measured on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 is 
“very painful” and 7 is “not painful at all.
” Out of the 105 
who reported having painful lesions, 92 (87 %) reported a 
decrease in the level of pain, and 47 (45 %) reported com-
plete recovery from pain. A statistical analysis showed 
that the mean score increased from 3.74 to 3.13 for the

tively, to 5.84 (P < 0.0001 for both groups) (Table 3).
Adverse effects
All participants reported no adverse effects.
Discussion
This study showed that suppressive treatment with Gene-
Eden-VIR/Novirin decreased the duration of genital her-
pes outbreaks. In addition, the treatment decreased the 
severity of genital herpes symptoms, the interference 
of symptoms with daily life, and the level of pain expe-
rienced during an outbreak. The results also showed a 
dose effect. Treatment with 2 capsules per day decreased 
the duration of outbreaks more than 1 capsule per day. 
Finally, the results showed that suppressive treatment 
with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin had no side effects, that is, 
suppressive treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin is 
safe.
Our study has some methodological advantages. The 
study tested the effect of the treatment over a wide range 
of durations, from 2 to 48 months, with an average of 
12 months. Moreover, 23 % of the participants in our 
study took Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin for at least 2 years, 
and some, for as long as 4 years. The use of a range of 
durations, rather than a single duration, made it possible 
to test for a duration of treatment effect.
Another methodological advantage is using two types 
of questions to gather information about the duration of 
outbreaks. The first type asked the participants to count 
the number of days of a typical outbreak, and the second 
asked them to rate the duration of their outbreaks on a 
1–7 scale. Using these two types, we verified the consist-
ency in the participants’ answers.
Yet another methodological advantage is the measure-
ment of the burden of disease. Our study tested a sup-
pressive, or long term treatment, yet, unlike most clinical 
studies of ACV, VACV, and FCV, it measured the effect 
on the duration of outbreaks, not the number of out-
breaks. If we define the burden of genital herpes as the 
total number of days with outbreaks, then the burden of 
genital herpes equals the average duration of an outbreak 
times the number of outbreaks. Since we could not find 
clinical studies of suppressive treatments that measured 
the effect on duration of outbreaks, and clinical studies of 
episodic treatments that measured the effect on the num-
ber of outbreaks, it seems that no previous studies meas-
ured the effect of ACV, VACV, and FCV on the burden of 
the disease. Our paper reports the effect of Gene-Eden-
VIR/Novirin on the duration of outbreaks. Polansky et al. 
[24] reports the effect of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on the 
number of outbreaks. By multiplying the results in both 
papers, one can calculate, for the first time, the effect of a 
treatment on the burden of genital herpes.
This clinical study did not include a placebo control. 
The FDA guidance lists six types of controls: (1) Pla-
cebo Concurrent Control, (2) No-treatment Concur-
rent Control, (3) Dose–response Concurrent Control, 
(4) Active (Positive) Concurrent Control, (5) External 
Control (including Historical Control and baseline-
controlled studies), and (6) Multiple Control Groups 
[25]. This clinical study included three controls recom-
mended by the FDA: a no-treatment concurrent control,

PROs are extensively used for collecting clinical data [26]. 
In fact, out of the 96,736 clinical trials registered in the 
ClinicalTrials.gov data base between November 2007 and 
December 2013, 26,337, or 27 %, used at least one PRO 
measure [27]. In addition, past studies showed that PROs 
had a significant role in the development and evaluation 
of new medicines [28]. According to the FDA, PROs are a 
valid and valuable source for measuring the efficacy of new 
drugs. They are reliable enough to warrant an approval of 
a label claim for a new drug. From the years 1997 to 2002, 
the FDA approved 23 new drugs based on results obtained 
in studies that used only PRO endpoints. They include six 
anti-migraine products (Amerge®, Ax-ert®), several anti-
epileptics (Gabitril®, Keppra®), and a variety of other ther-
apy classes (Tamiflu®, Relenza®). The FDA regards PROs 
as a valid and valuable source of data. The scientific com-
munity also believes that PROs are valid and useful. Many 
major journals published clinical studies that use patient 
reported outcomes. The trust of the FDA and the scientific 
community in PROs should convince the medical com-
munity, and specifically, doctors, to trust studies that use 
PROs when evaluating the benefits of new treatments.
Due to nature of PRO’s, a possible limitation in this 
type of study might be the subjective reports by the par-
ticipants. One might argue that the participants’ have 
evaluated the effect of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on symp-
toms, which are unrelated to their infection. To address 
this question, we compared the symptoms as reported 
by the participants to the standard signs and symptoms 
as reported in the literature [29]. The comparison clearly 
showed that the reported symptoms and the major stand-
ard symptoms of genital herpes as found in the literature 
overlapped (data not shown).
The framework of this clinical study is nontraditional. 
It tested a suppressive, or long term treatment, in both 
severe and mild genital herpes cases. Such a framework 
deviates from the common medical practice. The rea-
son for deviating was our dissatisfaction with the health 
benefits of the current medical practice. Gene-Eden-
VIR/Novirin has an excellent safety profile. In a previous 
study, we reported that long term daily use of Gene-
Eden-VIR/Novirin has no side effects [22]. This inspired 
us to test an alternative practice, a suppressive, rather 
than episodic treatment, with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novi-
rin, in both severe and mild cases of genital herpes. We 
were happy to discover that our bet paid off. We believe 
that the results in our study prove the value of this treat-
ment. It is interesting that the Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
alternative is consistent with the preference of patients. 
Romanowski et al. reported that the subjects in their 
study, who were under suppressive treatment, felt that it 
offered a better control of the disease, and a more con-
venient option [30].
Conclusions
This paper shows that suppressive treatment with 
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin decreased the duration of 
genital herpes outbreaks, in severe and mild cases, 
without side effects. Based on the results reported 
in this and our previous paper, we recommend sup-
pressive treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin as 
a natural alternative to both suppressive and episodic 
treatments with current drugs, in both severe and mild 
genital herpes cases.
