Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus RNA was detected in im-
mature Hyalomma rufipes ticks infesting northward migratory 
birds caught in the North Mediterranean Basin. This finding 
suggests a role for birds in the ecology of the Alkhurma hem-
orrhagic fever virus and a potential mechanism for dissemi-
nation to novel regions. Increased surveillance is warranted.
A
lkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV) was iden-
tified in 1995 after an outbreak of viral hemorrhagic 
fever in Jeddah Province, Saudi Arabia (1). This virus 
is a variant of Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), 
which is endemic in eastern India, and a member of the 
mammalian tickborne flaviviruses (2). An association 
between Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever cases and live-
stock handling was identified early on, suggesting goats 
and sheep are potential reservoirs (3). Furthermore, 
AHFV has been identified in Ornithodoros savignyi soft 
ticks and Hyalomma dromedarii hard ticks (potential 
vectors) in Saudi Arabia, both of which are associated 
with camels (potential reservoir) (4,5). Alkhurma hem-
orrhagic fever is endemic in several provinces of Saudi 
Arabia; sporadic cases have been reported in Africa near 
the Egypt–Sudan border and cases of seropositivity in 
Djibouti (6–8) (Figure 1). AHFV RNA has also been de-
tected in Amblyomma lepidum ticks collected from cattle 
in Djibouti (9).
The clinical manifestation of Alkhurma hemorrhagic 
fever resembles that of other viral hemorrhagic fevers: 
initial malaise and influenza-like symptoms, followed 
by encephalitis, icterus, and ecchymosis. Case fatality is 
≈25% but could be considerably lower, considering mild 
cases are probably undiagnosed (1). It has been suggested 
that both KFDV and AHFV originated in Africa and that, 
subsequently, KFDV spread to India and AHFV to Saudi 
Arabia, KFDV possibly disseminating farther to southern 
China by migratory birds (2). Also, other pathogens have 
been found to disseminate by means of ticks on migratory 
birds (10). In light of these findings, case reports in Africa 
(6–8), and increasing case frequency in Saudi Arabia (11), 
we investigated whether ticks infesting migratory birds en 
route from Africa to Europe and Asia during springtime 
carry AHFV.
The Study
We collected ticks from birds migrating northward ini-
tially at 2 bird observatories on the Mediterranean 
 
islands Capri (Italy; 40°33′N, 14°15′E) and Andikíthira 
(Greece; 35°51′N, 23°18′E) during spring of 2009 and 
2010. We captured 14,824 birds (78 species) during their 
yearly migration, presumably leaving Africa for breeding 
grounds in Europe or Asia. We collected 747 ticks, 88% 
of which were identified morphologically as members of 
the complex H. marginatum sensu lato (s.l.), most likely 
H. rufipes and H. marginatum. We screened cDNA for 
AHFV by real-time PCR with primers targeting the 5′ 
untranslated region of AHFV (12). Five fully engorged 
ticks, morphologically and molecularly determined to be 
H. marginatum s.l., likely H. rufipes (GenBank accession 
nos. MH061004–MH061008, MH061010–MH061014), 
tested positive for AHFV RNA in 2 separate analyses. 
These 5 ticks (4 nymphs, 1 larva) were collected at An-
dikíthira in 2010 (Table) from 3 bird species that win-
ter in sub-Saharan Africa and breed in Europe (Figure 1, 
panels A–C). One sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoeno-
baenus) carried 2 AHFV-positive nymphs. Sequencing of 
the 5′ untranslated region amplicons revealed 2 identical

72-bp sequences. BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
blast/) and comparative analyses revealed high identity to 
AHFV and KFDV reference sequences, despite a region 
with 7 consecutive mismatching nucleotides and a 14-nt 
deletion (Figure 2, panel A). Apart from this difference, 
100% identity was seen with all other AHFV and KFDV 
sequences available in GenBank.
Because of these results, we included additional bird 
observatories and collection sites along with Capri and An-
dikíthira in spring of 2014 and 2015: the Anapodaris River, 
Crete, Greece (34°59′N, 25°17′E); Huelva Province, Spain 
(37°30′N, 5°30′W); Sevilla Province, Spain (37°33′N, 
6°55′W); Canary Islands, Spain (28°9′N, 15°25′W); Jeru-
salem, Israel (31°47′N, 35°13′E); and the Kizilirmak Delta, 
Turkey (41°38′N, 36°05′E). We ringed 22,069 birds (137 
species) and collected 1,024 ticks. RNA was extracted at 
Uppsala University (Uppsala, Sweden) and sent to Agence 
Nationale de Sécurité Sanitaire de l’Alimentation (Paris, 
France) for high-throughput screening by microfluidic real-
time PCR (Biomark Dynamic Arrays, Fluidigm, South San 
Francisco, CA, USA) targeting multiple tickborne viruses 
(S. Moutailler, unpub. data). One fully engorged adult tick, 
molecularly determined to be H. marginatum s.l. (GenBank 
accession nos. MH061009, MH061015), likely H. rufipes, 
collected from a common redstart (Phoenicurus phoeni-
curus) in Turkey tested positive for AHFV RNA (Table) 
when using a set of primers and probe that amplifies part of 
the KFDV/AHFV premembrane region (Kyasanur_poly_F, 
5′-ACACGATGCACACACCTGC-3′; Kyasanur_poly_R,

  Alkhurma Virus in Hyalomma Ticks Infesting Birds
performed with the same primers and probe. Alignment 
of the 31-bp fragment revealed a single nucleotide change 
compared with available AHFV sequences and 3 or 4 dif-
ferences compared with available KFDV sequences (Fig-
ure 2, panel B). The methods used did not enable virus 
isolation and propagation; therefore, acquisition of further 
sequence information proved difficult. The common red-
start also breeds in Europe and winters in sub-Saharan Af-
rica, similarly to the 3 previously mentioned bird species 
(Figure 1, panel D).
Conclusions
We detected AHFV/KFDV RNA in 6 of 1,771 investigated 
ticks. Although we could not differentiate between KFDV 
and AHFV on the basis of the short sequences analyzed, 
we suggest these sequences represent AHFV because this 
supposition is geographically and ecologically more plau-
sible. Our findings are insufficient to establish the role of 
the H. rufipes tick as an AHFV vector. However, detection 
of AHFV RNA in Europe and Asia Minor raises concerns 
for conceivable dissemination of the virus to these areas, 
facilitated by climate change resulting in increased distri-
bution of Hyalomma spp. ticks.
H. rufipes ticks are widely distributed in Africa and 
are also present on the Arabian Peninsula, along the Red 
Sea coast (13). The H. rufipes species is a 2-host tick; 
that is, the nymph remains attached to ingest blood on 
the same host it did for its first blood meal as a larva. 
Immature ticks usually infest birds or small mammals 
(e.g., hares), whereas adult ticks feed on larger mammals 
(e.g., camels, buffaloes, cattle, and large birds) (13). 
Consequently, the AHFV-positive ticks (except the 1 
adult) most likely had fed only on the bird to which they 
were attached. This assumption implies that an imma-
ture tick could have acquired the virus vertically from its 
mother, from its putatively viremic avian host, or by co-
feeding transmission, which can occur when ticks feed 
close to >1 infective tick (14,15). However, in this case, 
co-feeding transmission is less plausible because the 2 
ticks attached to the same bird were not located close to 
each other (on the beak and nape). For several tickborne 
viruses, including KFDV, vertical transmission from the 
adult female tick to the eggs occurs. However, the prev-
alence of transovarial infection in nature is considered 
low (14). The 1 positive adult tick could have acquired 
virus in any of these ways or from a previous mammalian 
blood meal.
To our knowledge, birds have not been shown to play 
a role in the ecology or epidemiology of AHFV, and this 
tick species has not been identified previously as a possi-
ble vector. Our finding of this virus in ticks infesting birds 
en route from Africa to Europe and Asia, together with 
clinical cases in southern Egypt, the detection of AHFV 
RNA in ticks, and cases of seropositivity in Djibouti, 
could indicate a wider geographic distribution of the virus 
throughout eastern Africa and in novel regions. Further 
investigations of AHFV ecology and modes of transmis-
sion, including the potential role of Hyalomma ticks as 
vectors and passerine birds as reservoirs or distributors 
of potentially infected ticks, as well as increased surveil-
lance, are needed.
