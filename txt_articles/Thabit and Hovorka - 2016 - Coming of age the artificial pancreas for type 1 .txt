Abstract The artificial pancreas (closed-loop system)
addresses the unmet clinical need for improved glucose
control whilst reducing the burden of diabetes self-care in type
1 diabetes. Glucose-responsive insulin delivery above and
below a preset insulin amount informed by sensor glucose
readings differentiates closed-loop systems from conventional,
threshold-suspend and predictive-suspend insulin pump
therapy. Insulin requirements in type 1 diabetes can vary
between one-third–threefold on a daily basis. Closed-loop
systems accommodate these variations and mitigate the risk
of hypoglycaemia associated with tight glucose control. In this
review we focus on the progress being made in the
development and evaluation of closed-loop systems in
outpatient settings. Randomised transitional studies have
shown feasibility and efficacy of closed-loop systems under
supervision or remote monitoring. Closed-loop application
during free-living, unsupervised conditions by children,
adolescents and adults compared with sensor-augmented
pumps have shown improved glucose outcomes, reduced
hypoglycaemia and positive user acceptance. Innovative
approaches to enhance closed-loop performance are discussed
and we also present the outlook and strategies used to ease
clinical adoption of closed-loop systems.

Introduction
Since the late 1960s, when capillary blood glucose meters
were introduced into clinical practice [1], the progress in
diabetes management has become intrinsically linked to
innovations in diabetes technology. Insulin pump therapy,
the clinical feasibility of which was established in the 1970s
[2, 3], is an increasingly applied treatment modality,
particularly in the paediatric population. This approach uses
smart pumps with bolus calculators and data upload features
to guide clinical management [4]. Minimally invasive, real-
time continuous glucose measurement [5, 6] is progressing to
accurate, insulin-dosing approved, factory-calibrated
systems [7]. A concerted effort is underway to combine these
advancements and develop the ‘artificial pancreas’, also
known as the closed-loop system, to emulate the feedback,
glucose-responsive functionality of the beta cell [8, 9].
Closed-loop systems combine real-time sensor glucose
measurement with insulin pumps by using a control algorithm
to direct insulin delivery (Fig. 1) [10]. The autonomous,
graduated modulation of insulin delivery below and above
the preset insulin amount in a glucose-responsive manner
differentiates closed-loop systems from conventional insulin
pump therapy and low-glucose suspend/predictive low-
glucose suspend insulin delivery systems, which suspend
insulin delivery when sensor glucose is at or predicted to be
below a preset glucose threshold [11–13].
Closed-loop systems aim to improve glucose control whilst
reducing the burden of hypoglycaemia and diabetes self-care.
The clinical justification for closed-loop technology, its

 viability as a therapeutic option, findings from transitional and
home studies, and the outlook and integration into clinical
practice are discussed in the present review (further reviews
are available [14, 15]).
Meeting the need
Tight blood glucose control reduces the risk of long-term
diabetes related complications [16, 17] but is limited by
hypoglycaemia [18]. Insulin analogues and modern insulin
regimens, including insulin pump therapy, have lowered the
relative risk of hypoglycaemia compared with those observed
in the intensive insulin treatment group of the transformative
Diabetes Control and Complication Trial [16, 19, 20] but
inherent unpredictability and variability of glucose levels
remains a significant barrier. Glucose-responsive insulin
delivery by closed-loop systems addresses these unmet
clinical needs and aims to reduce the burden of diabetes care.
Key challenge: intra-individual variability in insulin
requirements Insulin requirements vary considerably within
individuals with type 1 diabetes by on average 30% overnight
and 20% during waking hours. However, this can vary from
one-third to three times that of planned insulin delivery, even
without intercurrent illness [21]. Potential reasons include
variable meal composition [22], aberrations in glucose
turnover, lability due to physical activity [23, 24] and changes
in insulin sensitivity in women during perimenstrual periods
[25]; however, exact quantification and attribution is
unknown. Attempts to elucidate and establish reliable insulin
needs through formalised protocols or during regular clinic
visits guided by data uploads [26, 27] are hampered by the
need for frequent re-adjustments of insulin requirements.
Experienced pump users may alternate basal patterns to match
daily lifestyle conditions or premeditated activities [28] but
this approach has variable success.
Responding to day-to-day and within-day glucose
variability is the key advantage that adaptive closed-loop
systems have over conventional insulin therapies. By
autonomously and continually modulating insulin delivery
in a glucose-responsive fashion, closed-loop systems deliver
insulin to minimise hyper- and hypoglycaemic excursions.
Adaptive features of the control algorithms individualise the
closed-loop system to particular physiology and lifestyle
patterns. The performance of closed-loop systems is, however,
limited by the speed of insulin absorption and glucose sensing
inaccuracies [29]. Nonetheless, via considerably variable
insulin delivery, beyond that normally applied in clinical
practice, the closed-loop system may help to achieve more
consistent glucose levels.
User needs and expectations Type 1 diabetes carries a
significant psychosocial burden and adversely impacts quality
of life [30, 31]. People with type 1 diabetes and their carers
demonstrate high interest and positive attitudes towards
closed-loop systems [32, 33] and value the prospect of having
‘time off from the demands of diabetes’ [34].
However, the low adherence with earlier generations of
continuous glucose monitors serves as a reminder of the
potential fate of new technologies [35] if input from users on
device complexities and form factors are not considered. This
is further justified by the reported association between user
adherence and diabetes technology performance [36]. Thus,
health psychologists are focused on optimising future uptake
and usability of closed-loop systems [37, 38].
Current biological alternatives to closed-loop
technology
Whole organ pancreas and islet cell allotransplantations have
been applied in clinical practice over the past 40 years
[39, 40]. Significant improvements in whole organ pancreas
transplantation techniques and post-operative care have led to

loop system comprises a

located on the insulin pump

controller/mobile phone device).

 increased patient and graft survival rates in the past decade
[41, 42]. Due to the involvement of major surgery, the risk and
benefit of the procedure has to be weighed carefully and on an
individual basis since the rate of perioperative morbidity,
mortality and re-transplantation is still substantial [43, 44].
Islet cell transplantation, on the other hand, avoids the need
for major surgical intervention given that intraportal
transplantation involves a less invasive percutaneous
radiological procedure [39, 45]. Compared with results from
whole organ pancreas transplantation, the success and
durability of islet cell transplantation have been less
favourable however [46]. Furthermore, the wider clinical
application of islet transplantation is hampered by several
obstacles including: (1) limited islet supply and limited
number of clinical sites with the skills and facilities for islet
preparation; (2) the drawbacks of intensive immunosuppression
therapy [47]; (3) alloimmune and autoimmune attacks resulting
in up to 80% islet cell loss post transplantation.
Since being introduced into clinical practice, the successful
use of pancreas and islet cell transplantation as mainstay
treatments for the wider population of type 1 diabetic
individuals, including the very young, pregnant individuals,
elderly people and those with significant comorbidities, re-
mains limited and is unlikely to fully address the needs of
the general type 1 diabetic population.
Foundations of closed-loop systems
Continuous glucose monitoring, insulin pump and control al-
gorithms constitute backbone technologies of the closed-loop
systems. These are discussed in more detail in this section.
Continuous glucose monitoring The present generation of
continuous glucose monitoring devices provide a minimally
invasive method to measure real-time interstitial fluid glucose
levels [7]. Commercial devices use a subcutaneously
implanted needle-type amperometric enzyme electrode, which
measures interstitial glucose concentration by detecting
changes in the electric current that is caused by the enzyme-
catalysed oxidation of glucose into hydrogen peroxide.
Examples of the continuous glucose monitoring devices that
have been used in closed-loop research include Enlite
(Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge, CA, USA) [48], Dexcom
G4 and G5 (Dexcom, San Diego, CA, USA) [49] and
Freestyle Navigator II (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA,
USA) [8].
Generally, glucose readings are provided every 1 to 5
min for up to 7 days of continuous wear per sensor inser-
tion. Previous generations of continuous glucose sensors
were limited by inconsistent sensor accuracy compared
with the reference standard (plasma glucose), with a mean
relative absolute deviation of around 15–20%. The large
measurement discrepancies reported by the previous
generation glucose sensors and reference methods may
lead to incorrect treatment decisions [50] and adversely
affect device usability and experience. In contrast, the
accuracy of the latest generation of devices has improved,
with the mean relative absolute deviation measuring at
around 9–11% [7] which is compatible with safe operation
of closed-loop systems [51].
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy Modern
insulin pumps comprise an insulin reservoir, a small battery-
operated motor (or other delivery apparatus) linked to a
computerised control mechanism and a subcutaneous infusion
set (cannula and tubing system) [4]. Many have a built-in,
customisable bolus calculator and monitor the ‘insulin on
board’, which is the amount of insulin-to-act left in the body
from the previous bolus. The patch pump design (exemplified
by Omnipod [Insulet, Billerica, MA, USA]) has a reservoir
unit that adheres directly to the user’s skin and houses an
integrated infusion set and automated inserter, thus making
it ‘tubing-free’. Sensor-augmented insulin pumps (e.g.
MiniMed Paradigm Veo [Medtronic MiniMed] and Vibe
[Animas, West Chester, PA, USA]) feature integration with
continuous glucose monitoring, and are associated with
reductions in HbA1c levels [52].
The sensor-augmented pump is further enhanced via ‘low-
glucose suspend’ and ‘predictive low-glucose suspend’
features [12, 13, 53]. The former feature allows insulin to be
automatically suspended for up to 2 h when sensor glucose
falls below a preset threshold [11, 12], whereas the latter
suspends insulin delivery when sensor glucose is predicted
to be below a preset glucose threshold by use of hypoglycaemia-
prediction algorithms and automatic pump suspension [13].
Control algorithms Two main families of control algorithms
have been used in closed-loop clinical studies: the classic
feedback proportional-integral-derivative controller [54] and
the model predictive controller [55]. The classical
proportional-integral-derivative controller adjusts insulin
delivery by assessing departure from target glucose level
(the proportional component), the area under the curve
between measured and target glucose levels (the integral
component), and the rate of change in the measured glucose
level (the derivative component).
The model predictive approach more readily accommodates
delays associated with insulin absorption and also accounts for
events having a protracted influence on glucose levels, such as
meals and manually delivered prandial and correction insulin
boluses. A mathematical model links insulin delivery to
glucose excursions and uses model-predicted glucose levels
to determine optimal insulin infusion rates.
Other clinically evaluated control approaches include the
fuzzy logic approach [48], which modulates insulin delivery
Diabetologia (2016) 59:1795–1805
1797
 on the basis of approximate rules to express empirical
knowledge acquired by diabetes practitioners. Many
algorithms include safety modules to constrain insulin
delivery, limiting the amount of insulin on board or the
maximum rate of insulin delivery, or suspending insulin
delivery when glucose levels are low or decreasing.
The hybrid closed-loop approach relies on manual
administration of prandial bolus to partially mitigate
absorption delay of subcutaneous, rapid-acting insulin.
Strategies to fully implement closed-loop systems without
prandial bolus, to further reduce the burden of self-care are
being considered [56, 57].
Challenges and innovations Performance of closed-loop
systems is damped by variable and relatively slow absorption
of currently available rapid-acting insulin analogues [58],
delaying onset of and prolonging insulin action [59]. This is
of particular concern during exercise and in postprandial
conditions, when blood glucose fluctuations occur. Rapid-
acting insulin analogues, such as aspart, lispro and glulisine,
achieve peak plasma insulin concentrations at approximately
0.5–2 h, with the duration of action between 3–5 h. These
delays are compounded by the inherent 5–15 min lag between
glucose values in the interstitial and vascular space [60, 61].
Both the delay in insulin action and lag time for glucose
transport may attenuate performance of the daytime closed-
loop because of the rapid fluctuations of blood glucose levels
observed throughout the day (e.g. during meal times and
exercise). This is reflected by greater closed-loop incremental
benefits overnight, compared with daytime [8, 49]. The advent
of faster insulin aspart and other ultra-rapid insulin analogues
may help to address some of these issues. In a previous study,
the onset of appearance of faster insulin aspart in serum was
earlier (4.9 min vs 11.2 min) and serum faster aspart exposure
was four-and-a-half times greater in the first 15 min post-
injection, compared with standard aspart [62].
Alternative delivery routes to accelerate systemic insulin
appearance include inhaled prandial insulin, which has a faster
onset and shorter action profile compared with rapid-acting
subcutaneous insulin [63] and preprandial administration by
a closed-loop system [64], resulting in an increased amount of
time spent in the target glucose range. Alternatively, a
specialised heating pad may be attached to the pump infusion
set to warm surrounding tissues following a prandial insulin
bolus, accelerating insulin pharmacokinetics and pharmaco-
dynamics [65].
Advances in continuous glucose monitoring technologies
to improve sensor performance and user adherence include
long-term (up to six months) implantable glucose sensors that
are unaffected by the external sensor-signal attenuation issues
faced by conventional sensors [66]. At present, a factory-
calibrated subcutaneous glucose sensor can be worn for up
to 2 weeks [67]. Efforts are also underway to develop a
‘single-port’ device, which combines sensor glucose
measurements with an insulin infusion cannula into a single
subcutaneous insulin infusion set [68]. Simultaneous glucose
monitoring at the site of insulin infusion may help to reduce
the burden of multiple set insertions by users.
Clinical evaluation of closed-loop insulin delivery
in transitional outpatient settings
Clinical testing in controlled laboratory conditions has been
followed by transitional studies in diabetes camps, hotels and
outpatient settings. Using this research approach, participants
are studied in a ‘real world’ environment but with close
monitoring by medical and research personnel. Below, we
discuss randomised controlled trials (see Table 1), although
non-randomised transitional studies have also been performed
[69–71].
A previous study, using 56 participants in a multicentre
diabetes camp setting over a single night, was carried out to
evaluate overnight closed-loop insulin delivery , with sensor-
augmented pump therapy acting as control [48]. Participants
were supervised and closely monitored during the study.
Compared with the control therapy, the number of episodes
of hypoglycaemia with sensor glucose values below
3.5 mmol/l was significantly reduced (p=0.003) with over-
night closed-loop insulin therapy, with comparable median
glucose levels. In another study, the application of overnight
closed-loop over 5–6 days in children and adolescents
attending a diabetes camp did not improve the time spent in
the target glucose range compared with sensor-augmented
pump therapy, using an intention to treat analysis. However,
time spent in the hypoglycaemic state (specified as 2.8 mmol/l,
3.3 mmol/l and 3.9 mmol/l) were reduced significantly
(p < 0.03) [72]. In contrast, use of a hybrid day-and-night
closed-loop system in a diabetes camp over 6 days showed
no improvement in glucose control when compared against
sensor-augmented pump therapy and low-glucose suspend
approach [73].
In a multicentre randomised study at an outpatient facility,
18 participants were remotely monitored and supervised
whilst using closed-loop therapy for 40 h [74]. Compared with
sensor-augmented pump therapy, closed-loop therapy
significantly reduced the risk of hypoglycaemia (p=0.003)
and the frequency of hypoglycaemia episodes (p = 0.02),
although mean glucose was increased by 0.5 mmol/l
(p=0.04). In another study, overnight closed-loop use for
five consecutive nights in an outpatient transitional setting
resulted in significantly improved time spent within target
glucose range (p<0.001) and improved mean glucose levels
overnight (p < 0.001), compared with sensor-augmented
pump therapy. Improvements in overnight glucose control

Home studies of closed-loop insulin delivery
Home studies represent the final benchmark testing
environment (for examples, see Table 1). However, for safety
reasons, some apply remote monitoring supervision. For
example, a home study with remote monitoring supervision
was performed in 24 participants for 6 weeks [76]; compared
with sensor-augmented pump therapy, overnight closed-loop
insulin delivery resulted in a significant reduction of time
spent in the hypoglycaemic state by twofold (p=0.02) whilst
simultaneously improving time spent within target glucose
range by 11 percentage points (p=0.003).
Unsupervised free-living home studies have been
performed to provide unbiased assessment of closed-loop
performance in the target environment. In a 1-week
unsupervised day-and-night free-living closed-loop application
in adults and adolescents, significant improvements in time
spent within target glucose range (p<0.01) and reduced mean
sensor glucose levels (p<0.03) were found, with no increase in
time spent with hypoglycaemia [77, 78].
Furthermore, two multicentre free-living home studies
have evaluated closed-loop systems over extended periods.
In one study, participants used closed-loop insulin delivery
in the evening (after dinner) and overnight for 2 months
[79]. Compared with sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy,
closed-loop systems improved time spent in target glucose
range (3.9–10.0 mmol/l) by 8.6 percentage points
(p<0.001), and reduced time spent in a hypoglycaemic state
(p<0.0001). In addition, HbA1c levels were also significantly
reduced (p=0.047). Insulin delivery during the study period
was reduced whilst using the closed-loop system compared
with sensor-augmented pump therapy (p = 0.029), and
participants used the closed-loop system approximately 67%
of the time between 20:00–08:00 hours.
In the second study, and the longest randomised home
study to date, a 3 month, day-and-night closed-loop
application in adults was compared with optimised sensor-
augmented pump therapy during unrestricted free-living
conditions. Closed-loop therapy improved the primary
endpoint (time in target glucose range 3.9–10.0 mmol/l) by
11 percentage points (p<0.001) and reduced HbA1c levels
(p=0.002) [8]. The relative risk of time spent hypoglycaemic
and burden of hypoglycaemia during a 24 h period was
reduced by closed-loop therapy compared with sensor-
augmented pump therapy (<3.9 mmol/l; −19%, p=0.02; and
area under the curve when sensor glucose was <3.5 mmol/l;
−39%, p<0.001). In addition, improved glucose control was
achieved by closed-loop therapy, without changing total
insulin delivery (p=0.57). Participants used the system on
their own volition 83% of the whole study duration. These
results demonstrate the unique ability of closed-loop systems
to simultaneously reduce mean glucose and the risk of
hypoglycaemia, a feat unachievable with most other
therapeutic modalities.
Apart from biomedical outcomes, qualitative studies
evaluating closed-loop user feedback and experience may
guide and inform future directions of closed-loop system
development. In a psychosocial analysis of adult and
adolescent users of overnight closed-loop systems during
home studies, widely reported benefits included having ‘time
off’ from managing their diabetes, with reduced worry of their
blood glucose levels [37, 80]. Closed-loop application was
found to have a positive impact on hypoglycaemia fear and
other indices of health-related quality of life outcomes [38].
Common negative themes encompass device size, device
connectivity and sensor calibration issues [37].
Bihormonal closed-loop systems
The risk of hypoglycaemia may be further reduced with the
use of bihormonal (also known as dual-hormone) closed-loop
systems delivering subcutaneous glucagon when
hypoglycaemia is detected or predicted [81]. Bihormonal
systems can be tuned to apply insulin in the same fashion as
insulin-only closed-loop systems (‘insulin-non-aggressively
tuned bihormonal system’) or in a more ‘aggressive’ fashion,
anticipating that glucagon may mitigate against insulin over-
delivery (‘insulin-aggressively tuned bihormonal system’)
[82].
A day-and-night bihormonal insulin-aggressively tuned
closed-loop system was studied over 5 days in a transitional
outpatient setting where adult participants performed regular
activities during the day and spent overnight in a hotel room
while being closely supervised and monitored [49]. In
addition, adolescent participants were studied in a diabetes
camp setting. Overall, mean glucose was significantly reduced
by 1.4 mmol/l (p<0.001) and the proportion of time spent
within the target glucose range was increased (p < 0.001)
compared with conventional pump therapy at home.
Furthermore, time spent hypoglycaemic was significantly re-
duced in adults (p=0.01). This bihormonal system delivered
an average 0.8 mg of subcutaneous glucagon per day. Another
randomised crossover study evaluated bihormonal closed-
loop therapy in preadolescent children aged 6–11 years in an
outpatient diabetes camp setting for 5 days [83]. Compared
with conventional insulin pump therapy, mean sensor glucose
on days 2–5 were reduced by 1.7 mmol/l (p=0.0037) and the
time spent with hypoglycaemia was also reduced (p<0.0001).
The bihormonal system reduced, but not completely
eliminated, the need for rescue carbohydrates (p = 0.037).
1800
Diabetologia (2016) 59:1795–1805
 Mean plasma glucagon levels were projected to be above the
normal fasting range.
Non-aggressive bihormonal and insulin-alone closed-
loop systems were compared in a paediatric diabetes camp
over three consecutive nights [84]. The nocturnal time
spent with hypoglycaemia with the bihormonal system
was significantly reduced compared with the insulin-
alone system (p = 0.032). Mean sensor glucose levels were
comparable between the two interventions.
In addition, a bihormonal fully closed-loop system (no
prandial boluses) has been compared with conventional insu-
lin pump therapy over 48 h, in a randomised home study [85].
Median glucose levels and time spent in the target glucose
range and below the target range were comparable during both
study visits. However, median glucose on the second day of
the closed-loop intervention was significantly reduced during
the closed-loop period (p = 0.027) which came at the
expense of greater time spent in the hypoglycaemic range
(p = 0.017).
Bihormonal systems have a high complexity and are
presently limited by the need for a second pump device for
glucagon delivery. The user is required to replace glucagon
and the infusion set every 24 h due to the instability of current
glucagon preparation during extended pump use [86]. Thus,
efforts are underway to develop a dual-chamber pump device
and stable glucagon preparation for use in bihormonal closed-
loop systems [87]. In addition, long-term data from human
studies are needed to address the uncertainty regarding safety
and tolerability associated with chronic subcutaneous
glucagon.
Other adjunctive approaches with closed-loop
insulin delivery
There is an increasing interest in the feasibility of adjunctive
therapies to suppress postprandial hyperglucagonaemia
and associated hyperglycaemia [88]. The adjunctive
therapies include pramlintide and glucagon-like peptide-1,
which have been evaluated in combination with closed-loop
insulin delivery in research facility settings.
A small study compared closed-loop insulin delivery
either alone or with subcutaneous pramlintide before
meals, during two 24 h periods [89]. No premeal insulin
boluses or meal announcements were provided during
either visit. Overall, pramlintide co-delivery significantly
reduced the postprandial time to peak plasma glucose
(p < 0.0001), plasma glucose excursions (p = 0.006) and
the meal-related area under the curve glucose excursion
(p = 0.04) compared with closed-loop therapy alone. In
another study, the use of either pramlintide or exenatide
during closed-loop insulin delivery were compared with
closed-loop insulin delivery alone, over 27 h [90].
Compared with closed-loop insulin delivery alone, co-
administration of exenatide, but not pramlintide, led to a
significantly greater reduction in glucose levels after
lunch and dinner (p < 0.03 and p > 0.05, respectively).
Interestingly, glucagon suppression was significantly
greater with exenatide co-administration (p < 0.03) but
not with pramlintide co-administration (p > 0.05) when
compared with closed-loop insulin delivery alone. The
investigators reported no increase in hypoglycaemia ep-
isodes with either exenatide or pramlintide. The number
of participants who experienced gastrointestinal adverse
events, however, was higher with exenatide (three par-
ticipants experienced nausea, and one had an episode of
vomiting) compared with pramlintide (one experienced
nausea).
Outlook and conclusions
Evidence from transitional and home studies is encouraging,
demonstrating progress towards real life closed-loop clinical
use [91]. International and national funders have cumulatively
provided grants in excess of $200 million for closed-loop
academic research over the past decade, whilst device
manufacturers have committed significant resources towards
commercialisation. For example, in the first half of 2016, a
pivotal study of the hybrid closed-loop 670G insulin pump
was completed by Medtronic. With a large amount of
stakeholder engagement and a relatively low developmental
risk there is an expectation for the technology to be available
in clinical practice before the end of the decade. In line with
this, a recent review by the UK National Institute for Health
Research reported that automated closed-loop systems
may be expected to appear in the market by the end of
2018 [92]. This will largely be dependent upon regulatory
approvals (but there is a reassuring attitude of regulatory
agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration
towards these therapies) and whether infrastructures and
support are in place for the healthcare professionals pro-
viding clinical care. Structured education will also need to
continue to augment efficacy and safety of this therapy. It
is also important to note that, since closed-loop devices
may be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, such as interfer-
ence with wireless protocols and unauthorised data retrieval
[93], implementation of secure communications protocols is
vital.
The cost-effectiveness of closed-loop systems is to be
determined to support access and reimbursement to healthcare
users and funders, respectively. In addition to the conventional
endpoints, such as HbA1c, quality of life is to be included to
assess the burden of disease management and associated
hypoglycaemia. Future research may include elucidating the
subpopulations which may benefit most and, as such, research
Diabetologia (2016) 59:1795–1805
1801
 is on-going to evaluate the efficacy of closed-loop systems in
the very young [94], pregnant women with type 1 diabetes
[95] and those with inpatient hyperglycaemia [96, 97].
Prolonged 6–24 month multinational closed-loop clinical
trials are currently underway or in preparation, using adult
and paediatric populations.
Technological advances in glucose sensing may provide
marginal improvements in glucose management outcomes
with the use of closed-loop systems, but may be a key driver
for the adoption of closed-loop therapy by users if the size of
the glucose sensor is reduced, sensor wear time prolonged
and the need for calibration avoided. Further technological
advancements should also focus on improvements in insulin
delivery to prolong infusion catheter use, reduce silent
infusion catheter occlusions and accelerate insulin absorption
and action to improve efficacy of closed-loop therapies,
possibly allowing for the development of a fully closed-loop
system without the need for user-initiated prandial insulin
dosing. Control algorithms play a crucial role in facilitating
adaptation and individualisation whilst mitigating against
imperfections of other closed-loop system components
including glucose sensing inaccuracies and pump delivery
errors. These adaptation capabilities are distinguishing
features of closed-loop systems and, thus, advances in these
technologies would also be of benefit for the efficacy of these
devices.
Significant milestones, with research moving from
laboratory to free-living unsupervised home settings, have
been achieved in the past decade. Through inter-disciplinary
collaboration, an accelerated progress in real world closed-
loop application has been demonstrated. Given the challenges
of curative cell based and immunological therapies, closed-
loop technologies provide a viable alternative for pancreatic
endocrine replacement therapy and have a continuing
innovation potential.
