Recently, the use of a liquid biopsy has shown promise in monitoring tumor burden. While point 
mutations have been extensively studied, chromosomal rearrangements have demonstrated greater 
tumor specificity. Such rearrangements can be identified in the tumor and subsequently detected in 
the plasma of patients using quantitative PCR (qPCR). In this study we used a whole-genome mate-
pair protocol to characterize a landscape of genomic rearrangements in the primary tumors of ten 
ovarian cancer patients. Individualized tumor-specific primer panels of aberrant chromosomal junctions 
were identified for each case and detected by qPCR within the cell-free DNA. Selected chromosomal 
junctions were detected in pre-surgically drawn blood in eight of the ten patients. Of these eight, three 
demonstrated the continued presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) post-surgery, consistent 
with their documented presence of disease, and in five ctDNA was undetectable in the post-surgical 
blood collection, consistent with their lack of detectable disease. The ctDNA fraction was calculated 
using a novel algorithm designed for the unique challenges of quantifying ctDNA using qPCR to allow 
observations of real-time tumor dynamics. In summary, a panel of individualized junctions derived from 
tumor DNA could be an effective way to monitor cancer patients for relapse and therapeutic efficacy 
using cfDNA.
The analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) shows exciting promise for the detection of genomic altera-
tions associated with cancer. CfDNA is a natural phenomenon and is thought to originate from DNA released 
into the circulation from apoptotic cells deriving primarily from normal noncancerous tissue. However, in cancer 
patients the release of DNA from necrotic tumor cells (ctDNA) constitutes a significant portion of total cfDNA1.
Strong correlations between ctDNA and disease prognosis have been reported in advanced colorectal cancer2. 
Additionally, ctDNA levels were demonstrated to correlate with progression or remission in breast3 and prostate4  
cancers, and in melanoma5. Patients with advanced stage cancers have been reported to have higher levels 
 
of ctDNA than earlier stage patients across several different cancer types6, with specificity nearing 100%7. 
Encouragingly, serial monitoring of ctDNA in breast cancer was suggested to be more informative than standard 
techniques used to detect recurrence clinically: In a report by Olsen and colleagues, ctDNA was observed an 
average of 11 months before metastases were detected clinically in 86% of patients, and was undetectable in those 
without recurrence8. The predicted short half-life of ctDNA of about two hours2 allows a real-time glimpse into 
tumor dynamics, enhancing its immediacy in monitoring therapeutic efficacy. Thus, the detection of ctDNA has 
great potential as a specific biomarker for monitoring tumor burden.
Ovarian Cancer (OC) is one of the most common cancer deaths among patients with gynecologic malignan-
cies, with approximately 21,290 new cases diagnosed and 14,000 deaths estimated for 20159. Most OC patients are 
diagnosed with late-stage invasive disease, and although the majority experience initial remission after surgical

debulking and adjuvant chemotherapy, about 75% relapse and develop chemo-resistant disease10. While meas-
urement of blood levels of the CA-125 protein has been a widely used biomarker for OC for over two decades, 
this circulating protein is neither sensitive nor specific11. Moreover, other biomarkers such as HE4 that have been 
recently proposed need further investigation12. Thus, there is a need for additional biomarkers, both for screening 
and monitoring OC, that could complement and improve upon CA-125 and other available biomarkers.
Previously ctDNA studies in OC have focused on the identification of point mutations in TP53 13, a gene 
panel consisting of known tumor drivers14, whole exome15,16 or paired-end DNA direct sequencing of cfDNA6. 
In one study, a fusion gene involving FGFR2 was identified in an OC case17. Serial blood collections were tested 
for the presence of the fusion in ctDNA over the course of multiple treatments and found the detection of the 
FGFR2 fusion product to be a more sensitive biomarker for tumor recurrence than CA-125 17. Recently, ctDNA 
was detected an average of 7 months preceding positive CT scans for recurrence in 44 patients with a range of 
gynecological cancers, including 22 with ovarian cancer18. Collectively, these studies provide evidence supporting 
the feasibility of disease monitoring using ctDNA in OC. Reported quantification methods differ between studies, 
however, making it difficult to adapt a ctDNA detection approach for clinical use.
We report here an individualized, sensitive and specific approach for disease surveillance and therapeutic 
response monitoring in OC. A next-generation sequencing mate-pair protocol (MPseq) was used to identify 
somatic structural genomic alterations in primary tumors and a subset were quantitated in blood samples of each 
patient. Unique for each tumor, these aberrant DNA junctions involved genes with protein products that could 
be therapeutically targetable or were characteristic of significant clonal populations. A novel algorithm utilizing 
qPCR values for tumor-specific junctions and a housekeeping gene was applied to quantify the relative level of 
mutant DNA fragments to assess tumor burden. Thus, this proof-of-concept study describes a methodology that 
could serve as a useful tool to monitor disease regression or recurrence in a novel quantitative manner.
Results
Landscape of structural rearrangements in serous ovarian carcinoma. 
Figure 1A exemplifies the 
workflow process utilized in this study for monitoring tumor-defined rearrangements in the blood. Ten patients 
with high-grade serous OC stage III-IV (Table 1) were selected retrospectively with plasma samples available 
from both pre- and post-operative surgery blood draws. DNA was initially isolated from fresh-frozen surgically 
resected primary tumor tissue and whole-genome sequenced using the MPseq protocol19,20. Structural DNA var-
iant analysis was performed on the 10 patients using previously published bioinformatics algorithms developed 
in our group19,20.
Large genomic rearrangements were highly abundant in all cases analyzed (Fig. 1B). An average of 188 junc-
tions/case (median 184) were observed between the 10 cases, with a range of 50–389 (Fig. 1B) when counting 
junctions with at least 3 supporting mate-pairs. Additional junctions expected based on the portion of the refer-
ence genome that is unmapped range from 5.19–40.88 (Fig. 1B).

The landscape of genomic rearrangements for representative sample OC067 is presented as a genome plot 
(Fig. 2). The number and span of alterations observed in sample OC067 are typical of serous ovarian patients. 
The genome plot details chromosomal rearrangements of the genome. Inter-chromosomal junctions appear 
as magenta lines to illustrate the relative locations of the breakpoints. Intra-chromosomal junctions appear as 
magenta horizontal lines over the affected area or magenta dots for small focal alterations. Junctions further 
investigated are shown in green. Genome plots for additional cases are available in the supplemental materials

from 9 to 35 ng/ml (Supplemental Figure 9A). When compared, the pre-surgical plasma samples showed a slightly 
higher quantity of cfDNA (median 16.5 ng/ml), than post-surgical plasma samples (median 13.2 ng/ml), but not 
at a statistically significant level (Supplemental Figure 9B).
PCR screening of junctions in cfDNA. 
From rearrangements detected in each case, panels of PCR prim-
ers spanning the detected breakpoints were designed as unique tumor markers. In representative exemplar case 
OC049 a total of 229 chromosomal junctions were observed in the primary tumor (Figs 1B and 3A). The two 
events chosen for ctDNA analysis, highlighted in green, both predict copy number gains from intra-chromosomal 
rearrangements on chromosome 1. Each junction was initially verified in the primary tumor DNA and demon-
strated to be a true somatic event absent from the germline (Fig. 3B). Subsequent qPCR screening of pre- and 
post-surgical plasma cfDNA of case OC049 showed amplification products (Fig. 3C,D) and Sybr Green melting 
curves, which were identical to those seen in the primary tumor and the identity of the products was confirmed 
by Sanger sequencing (data not shown).
For eight out of the ten patients tested, junctions identified in DNA of the primary tumor were also detected 
in the cfDNA derived from pre-surgical plasma (Table 1). Of these eight, three demonstrated a continued pres-
ence of the ctDNA post-surgery, consistent with the presence of disease, which was documented at the time of 
the blood draw. In five patients, ctDNA could not be detected post-surgery, in accord with the lack of detectable 
disease observed at the time of the blood draw. Thus, for these eight cases, perfect concordance was observed 
between ctDNA detection and clinical presentation at the time of the blood draw. In two of the ten cases, somatic 
rearrangements could not be detected in the patient plasma.
Quantitative PCR measurement of ctDNA breakpoints in cfDNA. 
Quantitative PCR assays were 
developed and used to quantitate the amount of each aberrant chromosomal junction relative to the control beta 
actin housekeeping gene (Fig. 4). Primers unique to each junction were designed and optimized for qPCR. The

difference in primer efficiencies was corrected by normalizing standard qPCR curves of tumor DNA for each 
individual case. ϕj
ref  and ϕβ
ref  were determined by taking the mean of the Ct’s of a junction and beta actin (respec-
tively) for the first four highest concentrations of the tumor DNA (as they show the best linearity) (Fig. 4A). The 
standard curves were further corrected to take into account: 1) the percent of normal cells in the sequenced tumor 
DNA, 2) intra-tumoral heterogeneity represented by unique clones within the tumor, and 3) CNVs for the house-
keeping gene in the tumor.
The fraction of tumor cells in the tumor tissue, τ, was subsequently calculated using the tumor fraction equa-
tion (Fig. 4B). By determining the mode of MPseq read depth (M), we calculated the coverage for both the normal 
2-copy state (Mnat) and the deleted, 1-copy state (Mdel). Example reads for case OC049 are plotted according to 
their frequency; with resulting peaks correlating with copy number status (Fig. 4B). When Mnat equals 100, this 
corresponds to a diploid state, while sequences associated with a loss of one copy (Mdel) center around value of 50 
(Fig. 4B). Conversely, the peak centered at 150, corresponds to a single gain. The difference between the value of 
the Mdel peak and the value of 50 on the X-axis represents the fraction of normal, non-tumor DNA in the sample. 
To correct for intra-tumoral heterogeneity, χ was calculated using the tumor heterogeneity equation (Fig. 4C). 
It represents the fraction of the clone harboring a specific junction within the tumor. Finally, the value δ 
 is used 
to adjust for any CNV of beta actin (β 
T) in the tumor: δ 
 = 
 1 if β 
T loses one copy, δ 
 = 
 2 if β 
T is normal, and δ 
 = 
 3 
corresponds to one copy gain in the effective correction equation (Fig. 4D).
The final Quantitative Circulating Tumor Percentage Equation (Equation 1) was derived for calculating the 
percentage of ctDNA present in cfDNA, with the more in-depth derivation presented in materials and methods.

The Quantitative Circulating Tumor Percentage Equation was used to estimate ctDNA in all cases (Table 1,

screened junctions, respectively. In the post-surgical blood sample, ctDNA was 49.3% and 47.6% (Fig. 5), con-
sistent with the presence of disease 21 months post-surgery, thus suggesting a poor clinical prognosis. This result 
correlated with the recurrence of the cancer documented in the clinical record of the patient, who died of disease 
15 days following the second blood draw.
Qualitatively, our results matched clinical record data (when available) for the presence of disease at each 
draw. There was also a strong relationship between post-surgical CA-125 measurement and post-surgical quali-
tative qPCR results in our patients for whom comparisons could be made (Table 1). Post-surgical cases with low 
CA-125 (< 
30 U/mL) coincided with an absence of detectable ctDNA. We found that the percentage of ctDNA 
varied highly amongst the 8 patients analyzed, with values ranging from 0.3% to 49.3%. Standard deviations 
within each individualized panel of junctions tested for each case ranged from 0.0–32.9 %ctDNA (mean 3.3; 
median 0.6), showing a variability that can be attributed to heterogeneity within the tumor and/or differences in 
the amount of DNA released from corresponding clone.
Discussion
We report here a new algorithm, based on the quantification of specific somatic junctions in the blood of OC 
patients, to assess the fraction of ctDNA. Large numbers of chromosomal rearrangements were identified in the 
primary tumors of ten OC cases using a MPseq protocol. Individual somatic junctions were detected in the blood 
of eight (80%) patients (Table 1). The relative amount of tumor-specific fragments varied between cases and cor-
related with disease status with the exception of two cases where ctDNA was undetectable, even in pre-surgical 
blood.
Quantification methods for the ctDNA fraction of cfDNA reported up to date vary tremendously, making 
cross-comparisons difficult. In one study, ctDNA was quantified using standard curves constructed from serial 
dilutions of the purified rearrangement product17. Although this approach provides a more accurate assessment 
of ctDNA quantity, it would be prohibitively expensive and time consuming in a high through-put environment. 
The most commonly used methods involve calculation of delta Ct’s derived from qPCR, or digital PCR results. 
This approach, however, often neglects to factor in several important variables which impact final results. The 
qPCR algorithm we present in this study takes into account multiple parameters which affect accurate assessment 
of ctDNA quantities and is relatively inexpensive.
The detection of chromosomal junctions in ctDNA offers several benefits over the detection of point muta-
tions. First, it is extremely specific and robust, and performance is not affected by the abundance of fragments 
from normal DNA21–24. Second, it is more sensitive than the detection of somatic mutations, which are often at 
the threshold of sequencing error (~0.01%)7. Indeed, comparing the detection sensitivity of junctions to point 
mutations across multiple solid tumor types revealed greater sensitivity for the former6. Third, rearrangements 
leading to gene fusions can result in potentially clinically targetable protein products, the detection of which 
is fortuitously aided by increased copy numbers, whereas point mutations are typically present as one genome 
copy6. There are, however, several weaknesses to our approach: MPseq requires fresh frozen tumor or biopsy 
tissue which may not be routinely available. It is also a little more laborious since no common rearrangements 
are observed in OC, so each case demands construction of an individual panel for detection. Because alterations 
need to be initially identified in the tumor, and then tracked in the blood, our method could not be applied in an 
OC screening application.
The recent explosion of ctDNA studies and the rapid increase in sensitivity and specificity of methodologies 
for ctDNA detection allude to a coming clinical integration, and point to the possibility of routine measure-
ment of ctDNA in cancer patients in the near future. OC patients appear particularly suited to benefit from this 
approach, as they shed relatively higher amounts of ctDNA than those with other cancers6 and are also at great 
risk of recurrence following initial chemotherapy.

We envision performing sequencing of the tumor and creating a personalized monitoring panel after the com-
mencement of treatment. Additionally, this may be the ideal time to identify potential therapeutic targets unique 
to the cancer. Thus, should a patient recur, as most patients with ovarian cancer will10, a personalized treatment 
plan accompanied by a customized monitoring assay can be ready. By monitoring fluctuations of ctDNA% as a 
proxy for tumor burden, clinicians can infer tumor progression and response to treatment. Patients with detecta-
ble ctDNA post-surgery may benefit from closer follow-up. If the tumor fails to respond to a given drug, it can be 
discontinued –saving the patient unnecessary side-effects and costs. Fusion targets of therapy could likewise be 
monitored for response. Conceivably junctions indicative of specific clonal populations within the tumor DNA 
may be monitored for differential responses to treatment. Furthermore, early identification of nonresponders to 
conventional therapy may help physicians to select alternative treatments and identify patient subgroups eligible 
for clinical trials.
Recently, ctDNA increases in breast cancer were found to indicate recurrence earlier than rises in CTCs or 
CA 15-3. Furthermore, detection of ctDNA in half of these cases was possible an average of 5 months before radi-
ologically confirmed disease progression was observed3,25. Similar results have been reported in gynecological 
cancer18. More work will need to be done in OC patients to study how fluctuations in ctDNA% correlate with 
other clinical indicators of recurrence over multiple time-points.
Our novel algorithm helps to bring a liquid biopsy protocol closer to routine use in clinical practice. Following 
acquisition of tumor tissue via surgery or biopsy, the generation of individualized junction signature panels could 
be designed within three weeks. Our assay would provide clinicians with individualized tumor response informa-
tion that could be used with great flexibility in case management.
Materials and Methods
Case Selection and Sample Processing. 
Cases were selected out of 100 consecutive patients with sus-
pected epithelial serous stage IIIC-IV OC seen at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN from 8/1/2010–4/30/2012 
with available fresh frozen primary tumor and both pre- and post-surgical blood. Post-surgical draws were cho-
sen as available for this retrospective study. Late stage OC patients were selected because of their high tumor bur-
den thus greater ctDNA content6 and in order to align the study with the most common clinical presentation18. 
The study was approved by Mayo Clinic’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). All experiments were performed in 
accordance with the approved guidelines of the Mayo Clinic IRB. Each participant provided written informed 
consent for use of their biospecimens and clinical data in research. A total of 10 patients’ primary tumors were 
assessed for tumor purity by a pathologist for at least 60% tumor and macrodissected to enrich for tumor content. 
DNA was isolated using the Gentra Puregene Blood kit (Qiagen, MD, USA; 158445). DNA was sequenced using 
the MPseq protocol and analyzed for structural variations. CA-125 was measured within 20 days of the associated 
cfDNA blood draw. CfDNA was isolated from 3 mL of double-spun plasma using the Circulating Nucleic Acid 
kit (Qiagen, MD, USA; 55114). Quantification of total cfDNA was performed by the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA 
reagent (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR; P7581) (Supplemental Figure S9). Three milliliters of plasma or serum from 
individuals without cancer were pooled and processed in the same way for a negative control (NC cfplasma/NC 
cfserum).
Next-Generation Sequencing and Validation of Genomic Rearrangements. 
DNA from primary 
tumor was prepared using the Illumina MPseq Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced as 
two libraries per lane on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform19. The sequencing data was mapped using the pre-
viously described binary indexing mapping algorithm (BIMA)20; post-mapping processing was performed by 
SVAtools, a suite of R scripts also developed in our group. Bridged coverage and fragment size information can be 
found in Supplemental Figure S10. The read-to-reference-genome algorithm concurrently mapped both 100 bp 
MP reads across the whole human genome (hg20/GRCh38). SVAtools first removes replicate fragments and then 
uses a greedy custom clustering algorithm and a system of masks and filters to detect interchromosomal rear-
rangements or intrachromosomal rearrangements ≥ 
45 kb. Concordantly mapping MP reads were used to deter-
mine copy number across the genome. A minimum cluster of three discordant mapping MP reads was required 
to identify a chromosomal rearrangement (Fig. 1B)19,20. Chromosomal rearrangements were verified in patient 
tumor DNA samples as described previously19. Pooled human genomic DNA (gDNA) was used as a control 
(Promega, Madison, WI; G304A). DNA bands were Sanger sequenced to confirm rearrangements and identify 
precise genomic break points.
Generation of Individualized Monitoring Panels. 
A panel of 2 to 4 unique junctions was selected from 
primary MPseq data for each case to be used for detection in the blood (Supplemental Table S1). Selection pri-
oritized junctions indicative of gene alterations that had the potential for therapeutic intervention and/or were 
supported by at least 15 associated mate-pairs. Potentially targetable alterations were identified using the PANDA 
(Pathway and Annotation) tool, which allows visualization of data in the context of pathways and includes anno-
tations of drug-gene and gene-disease interactions (http://bioinformaticstools.mayo.edu/Panda/). The results 
were then cross-referenced with a database, which includes drugs approved for clinical use (https://clinicaltri-
als.gov/). After identifying the breakpoint for each junction of interest, new primers were designed to generate 
products < 
150 bps to be more suitable for qPCR and account for the fragmentation of ctDNA26. Junctions were 
confirmed as specific for somatic rearrangements by PCR using DNA from the pooled plasma of normal controls 
and buffy coat DNA for each patient. GAPDH amplification was used as an internal control (forward primer: 
GAACGGGAAGCTCACTGGCATG; reverse primer: CTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC).
Detection of ctDNA and Analytical Methods. 
Detection of ctDNA was accomplished using qPCR, per-
formed as follows: 150 nm of primers were added to 2x Sybr Green (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR; 4367659) and 3–4 ul

of template DNA. Serial dilutions of patient tumor DNA were used as positive controls and to allow quantification 
of the mutant product. Negative controls included NCcfDNA (normal control cfDNA), pooled gDNA, and water 
as a No Template Control (NTC). Beta actin was amplified in each qPCR for normalization purposes (forward 
primer: TCCTCTCCCAAGTCCACACA; reverse primer: GCACGAAGGCTCATCATTCA). qPCR was run 
on Applied Biosystems 7900 HT using a standard protocol (40 cycles of 95 °C 15 seconds and 60 °C 1 minute). 
Products were resolved by 4% agarose gel electrophoresis for visualization purposes.

beta actin (respectively) for the first four highest concentrations of the tumor DNA. Each qPCR reaction was run 
in duplicate, which was used to determine a standard deviation for each Ct value. These standard deviations were 
used to calculate an overall standard deviation for each ctDNA (Fig. 5).
The final derivation incorporated the EfCor variable correction for confounding factors of the percentage of 
normal cells, intratumeral heterogeneity and CNV of the house keeping genes:

where, T is tumor DNA (corresponding to a single allele), N is normal 2-copy state DNA, Mnat and Mdel are cov-
erage for the normal 2-copy state and the deleted, 1-copy state, respectively.
Heterogeneity equation. Correction for intra-tumoral heterogeneity (χ):

where, ν 
j is the number of associated mate-pairs for each junction, τ is the fraction of tumor DNA in the tissue 
sample calculated in tumor fraction equation (equation 4), and Mcov is the mode of the bridge coverage for a 
single allele.
The final derivation of the effective correlation equation (Equation 3) uses the value δ 
 to adjust for any CNV 
of beta actin (β 
T) in the tumor: δ = 1 if β 
T loses one copy, δ = 2 if β 
T is normal, and δ = 3 corresponds to one copy 
gain.
