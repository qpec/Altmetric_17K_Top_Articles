AbsTrACT
Objective to investigate the associations between 
using alternatives to the car which are more active for 
commuting and non-commuting purposes, and morbidity 
and mortality.
Methods We conducted a prospective study using 
data from 3 58 799 participants, aged 37–73 years, 
from UK Biobank. commute and non-commute travel 
were assessed at baseline in 2006–2010. We classified 
participants according to whether they relied exclusively 
on the car or used alternative modes of transport that 
were more active at least some of the time. the main 
outcome measures were incident cardiovascular disease 
(cVD) and cancer, and cVD, cancer and all-cause 
mortality. We excluded events in the first 2 years and 
conducted analyses separately for those who regularly 
commuted and those who did not.
results in maximally adjusted models, regular 
commuters with more active patterns of travel on the 
commute had a lower risk of incident (hr 0.89, 95% ci 
0.79 to 1.00) and fatal (hr 0.70, 95% ci 0.51 to 0.95) 
cVD. those regular commuters who also had more active 
patterns of non-commute travel had an even lower risk 
of fatal cVD (hr 0.57, 95% ci 0.39 to 0.85). among 
those who were not regular commuters, more active 
patterns of travel were associated with a lower risk of 
all-cause mortality (hr 0.92, 95% ci 0.86 to 0.99).
Conclusions More active patterns of travel were 
associated with a reduced risk of incident and fatal cVD 
and all-cause mortality in adults. this is an important 
message for clinicians advising people about how to be 
physically active and reduce their risk of disease.
InTrOduCTIOn
Physical activity, including less vigorous forms of 
physical activity such as walking and cycling, reduce 
the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).1 Despite 
the knowledge of its benefits, levels of activity 
are still low in many countries.2 With increasingly 
sedentary occupations and busy lives, many people 
have little time for leisure time physical activity. 
Activity as part of a journey, such as the commute 
or for transport in general, offers a comparatively 
easy way to integrate exercise into daily life.3
Prospective observational studies have shown 
associations between walking or cycling to work 
and health, principally through a reduced risk of 
cardiometabolic disease.4–6 While there is a good 
scientific rationale for focusing on walking or 
cycling to work due to its regular nature, for many 
comparatively car dependent populations, walking 
or cycling the entire journey is impractical because 
of the distances involved. For example, in the 
UK, only 17% of adults live within easy walking 
distance (2 
km) of work and only 35% live within 
easy cycling distance (5 
km).7 However, it is possible 
to incorporate more physical activity into journeys 
without completely replacing motor vehicle use—
for example, by using public transport, or walking 
or cycling parts of longer journeys made by car. 
These travel patterns involve more physical activity 
than exclusive car use and can add up, over the 
course of a typical working week, to a substantial 
amount of activity.8 9 These travel patterns are prev-
alent in some, particularly urban and peri-urban, 
populations10 and are likely to be more achievable 
for many people, but have been rarely studied.9 
In addition, with increases in home and remote 
working combined with an ageing population,11 
an increasing proportion of adults are less likely to 
make regular commutes. Much research is focused 
on the benefits of active commuting but the poten-
tial health gains associated with non-commuting 
travel are less well known.
We aimed to extend previous research by using 
data from a large epidemiological cohort to inves-
tigate prospective associations between more active 
patterns of travel relative to exclusive car use and 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and all-cause 
mortality in the general adult population.
MeThOds
study population and sample
We used data from UK Biobank, a national popu-
lation based study of 5 
02 
639 men and women, 
aged 37 to 73 years.12 13 Potential participants 
were selected through population based registers of 
patients registered with the National Health Service 
(NHS) from across England, Scotland and Wales. 
Those living within 35 
km of any of 22 assessment 
centres were invited. At baseline (March 2006–
July 2010), participants reported information on 
sociodemographic characteristics, physical activity 
and health conditions. All participants provided 
informed consent.
As there were some differences in demographic 
and health characteristics between those who 
commuted regularly and those who did not, we 
stratified our sample. We defined regular commuters 
as those participants who reported being employed, 
travelled to work at least 3 times/week and reported 
a home to work distance of greater than zero. Those 
not regularly commuting therefore comprised those

who were not employed (eg, retired or unemployed), along with 
those who were employed but reported either travelling to work 
<3 times/week or a home to work distance of zero miles. We 
chose this definition as those working part time or commuting 
only part of the week constituted a small proportion of the 
total and were more similar to those who were not regularly 
commuting. Participants with missing information on employ-
ment status, commute frequency or distance were excluded 
(figure 1).
exposures
Commute travel
Participants in employment were asked "What types of transport 
do you use to get to and from work?" Six response options were 
given: car/motor vehicle, public transport, cycle, walk, ‘none of 
the above’ and ‘prefer not to answer’. Participants could select 
more than one response.
Using these responses, we divided participants into two 
behavioural patterns or ‘phenotypes’: (a) those who reported 
exclusive use of the car and (b) those who reported any other 
travel pattern (‘more active patterns of travel’)—that is, 
including some walking, cycling or public transport, either alone 
or in combination with the car. Participants who reported ‘none 
of the above’ or ‘prefer not to answer’ were excluded.
Non-commute travel
All participants were asked "In the last 4 weeks, which forms of 
transport have you used most often to get about?", with occupa-
tional travel specifically excluded. The same response options 
were provided as for the question on commuting. We classified 
these responses in the same way.
Commute and non-commute travel
In addition, we classified regular commuters into one of four 
categories according to whether they reported exclusive car use 
for commuting, non-commuting travel, both or neither.
Outcomes
We studied five main outcomes: incident and fatal CVD (Inter-
national Classification of Disease 10th revision, codes I20–25 for 
ischaemic heart disease and I60–69 for cerebrovascular disease), 
incident and fatal cancer (excluding all skin cancer (melanoma 
and other malignant neoplasms) C43–44) and all-cause mortality. 
In addition, we studied four other outcomes: incident and fatal 
colon cancer (C18) and incident and fatal breast cancer (C19), 
with which a lack of physical activity has been shown to be 
specifically associated.14 15 To minimise the potential effects of 
reverse causation, we excluded all participants with new events

in the 2 
year period after baseline assessment. Outcomes were 
identified by linkage to hospital records, the national cancer 
registry and death certificates. Censoring dates for these datasets 
differed and differed in different regions but all were complete 
up to 3 November 2015. For example, hospital admission data 
for England were available up to 31 March 2015 but for Wales it 
was later (29 February 2016).
Covariates
Data from the baseline questionnaire were used to assess age, sex, 
ethnicity, highest educational qualification, occupation, house-
hold income, access to a car, dietary intake (through measures 
of consumption of fruit and vegetables), alcohol consumption, 
smoking status, occupational and recreational physical activity, 
shift working, sleep and screen time, longstanding illness/
disability, medical conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes) 
and medication usage. Height and weight were measured at 
the assessment centre and used to compute body mass index. 
Area level indices (Townsend score of deprivation and urban/
rural status) were derived from home postcodes.
statistical analyses
We used Cox regression to estimate the associations between 
more active patterns of travel and the hazard of each outcome. 
We made progressive adjustments to account for potential 
confounders (model 1: demographic and geographical char-
acteristics; model 2: individual socioeconomic characteristics; 
model 3: other behaviours; model 4: other health conditions) 
restricting all models for a given outcome to participants with 
complete data for all covariates in model 4. Full details are 
provided in online supplementary table A1. For all outcomes, 
individuals with prevalent conditions were excluded (eg, for 
CVD mortality, those with prevalent CVD were excluded). The 
proportional hazards assumption was assessed using log–log 
survival plots, and graphical checks suggested the assumptions 
were reasonable.
For each of the main outcomes in regular commuters, we 
tested interactions between exposure and car access (none, 1, 
2 or more) and home to work distance (<3 miles vs ≥3 miles). 
We chose these categories based on the prevalence of exclusive 
car use and distances reported in our sample. These character-
istics may limit available travel options, be socially and spatially 
patterned, and thereby moderate the associations observed.
sensitivity analyses
Given the limited number of events observed, we undertook a 
sensitivity analysis excluding only participants with events in the 
first year (rather than 2 
years).
resulTs
sample characteristics and travel patterns
In total, data from 358 799 participants were included in the 
analysis. Those included were more likely to report at least 
degree level education, higher occupational status and higher 
household incomes, and to engage in higher levels of physical 
activity than those who were excluded (see online supplemen-
tary table A2). Of those included in the analysis, 187 281 were 
regular commuters (mean age at baseline 52.1±6.8 years) 
and 171 498 were not (mean age 60.7±6.9 years) (table 1). 
Regular commuters tended to be younger and healthier and 
to report a higher household income than those who did not 
regularly commute. Approximately two-thirds of commuters 
relied exclusively on the car to travel to work, with more active

travel patterns being more frequently reported for non-com-
muting travel (table 2). While 81.7% of regular commuters 
and 77.3% of other participants reported using the car at least 
some of the time for non-commuting travel, 22.4% and 36.5%, 
respectively, reported some public transport use, and 44.9% 
and 52.5%, respectively, reported some walking. Cycling was 
less prevalent, being mentioned by 8.5% and 7.0% of regular 
commuters for commuting and non-commuting travel, respec-
tively, and by 4.8% of other participants.
Associations with main outcomes
Figure 2 shows the maximally adjusted associations (model 4) 
between more active patterns of travel and outcomes, and tables 
A3–A5 in the online supplementary material show the break-
down of progressive adjustment (models 1–4).
Regular commuters
Among regular commuters, more active patterns of travel for 
commuting were associated with estimated reductions of 11% 
in incident cases and 30% in fatal cases of CVD in models 
adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, 
physical activity and dietary behaviours, and other health condi-
tions (HR 0.89, 95% 
CI 0.79 to 1.00 and HR 0.70, 95% 
CI 
0.51 to 0.95, respectively) (figure 2 and online supplemen-
tary table A3). More active patterns of travel for commuting 
were not significantly associated with incident or fatal cancer 
or all-cause mortality, and were not significantly associated 
with any of the outcomes for non-commuting travel (figure 2 
and online supplementary table A3). However, dual exposure 
of more active patterns of commuting and non-commuting 
travel was associated with an estimated 43% reduction in fatal 
CVD events compared with exclusive car use for both types of 
travel in maximally adjusted models (HR 0.57, 95% 
CI 0.39 
to 0.85) (figure 2 and online supplementary table A4). This 
dual exposure was also associated with a reduction in incident 
CVD in model 3, but the association was no longer significant 
in the maximally adjusted model which included other health 
 
conditions (model 4).

Those not making regular commutes
Among those not making regular commutes, more active 
patterns of travel were associated with an estimated 8% reduc-
tion in all-cause mortality in maximally adjusted models (HR 
0.92; 95% 
CI 0.86 to 0.99) (figure 2 and online supplementary 
table A5). Associations for incident CVD and incident and fatal 
cancer were no longer significant in maximally adjusted models.
Associations with other outcomes
There were no significant associations with breast or colon 
cancer incidence or mortality in any models (see online supple-
mentary table A6).
sensitivity analyses and interactions
After relaxing the exclusion criteria such that only partici-
pants with events in the first year were excluded, the associa-
tions observed were of similar magnitude to those observed 
in the main analyses, with confidence intervals tending to be 
slightly narrower. T
wo associations became significant in regular 
commuters, for whom more active patterns of non-commuting 
travel were now associated with a lower risk of CVD and 
all-cause mortality (HR 0.76, 95% 
CI 0.59 to 0.98 and HR 0.91, 
95% 
CI 0.83 to 1.00, respectively).
We found no evidence that any of the associations between 
more active patterns of travel and the five main outcomes were 
moderated by distance to work or car access (all P>0.01).
dIsCussIOn
Principal findings
Although not all associations were significant, the general pattern 
of our results indicates that, irrespective of other physical activity, 
more active patterns of travel, compared with exclusive car use, 
were associated with reductions in risk of incident and fatal 
CVD and all-cause mortality. Of note, in regular commuters, 
more active patterns of travel were associated with a reduced 
risk of both incident (11%) and fatal (30%) CVD; the reduc-
tion in CVD mortality was increased to 43% among those who 
used more active patterns for non-commuting travel. The latter 
exposure was also associated with a significant, albeit smaller 
(8%), reduction in all-cause mortality among those who were 
not regular commuters.
strengths and limitations
Strengths of this analysis include use of a very large multicentre 
general population dataset, a focus on feasible travel choices 
for commuting and non-commuting travel, and the linkage 
to objectively ascertained morbidity and mortality outcomes 
using national datasets. Our analysis extends previous research6 
in important ways. These include more stringent exclusion of 
prevalent conditions, and incident cases occurring in the first 
2 
years; adjustment for a more comprehensive set of poten-
tial individual level confounders and other covariates, ranging 
from markers of socioeconomic position to behavioural char-
acteristics (sleep, diet and other physical activity) and mostly 
self-reported health conditions; and consideration of non-com-
muting travel as an important exposure alongside the more 
frequently researched activity of commuting. In general, the 
progressive adjustment indicated that the magnitude of the 
associations were very similar (even if some results became 
non-significant). In combination, these approaches are likely to 
have reduced but not eliminated the risks of reverse causation, 
residual confounding and a healthy worker effect, any of which 
might lead to an overestimation of the true effects. UK Biobank 
participants are less ethnically diverse and healthier than the 
general UK population,14 and a substantial number gave insuf-
ficient information on key variables for them to be included in 
analysis. Participants who were excluded from the analysis also 
tended to report lower levels of physical activity, lower occupa-
tional classification and lower educational attainment than those 
who were included. While this admittedly limits the generalis-
ability of some of our descriptive statistics to the national popu-
lation, there is no particular reason to believe that our results are 
not generalisable in principle. Our analyses assume that travel 
patterns remain relatively stable over follow-up. We did not have 
information about changes in activity from the entire cohort, but 
repeated measures in less than 2% of our sample 4 years after 
baseline indicated that patterns of commuting remained very 
stable for the majority.16
Comparison with other research
Our results are consistent with previous research suggesting that 
replacing exclusive car use with more active travel patterns may 
be beneficial for health.17 Of all the outcomes investigated, our 
results for incident and fatal CVD in regular commuters appear 
the strongest. The findings of a previous systematic review 
focused on active commuting and cardiovascular disease,5 as 
well as those of more recent studies, are somewhat inconsistent: 
some report positive (protective) associations for incident or 
fatal CVD,5 18 while others report null associations19–21 or mixed 
associations.22 23 However, given that our sample is substantially 
larger than that used in all but one of these previous studies,5 we 
suggest that our results shift the overall balance of evidence to a 
position that more clearly supports the potential contribution of 
active travel to the primary prevention of CVD in commuters. 
This is supported by other epidemiological evidence linking 
cardiovascular outcomes with physical activity in general,24 and 
linking active commuting and regular physical activity with plau-
sible biological mechanisms, such as blood pressure reduction 
and anti-inflammatory effects.6
We also found that more active patterns of travel were associ-
ated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality among those not 
regularly commuting. This result is in line with a meta-analysis25 
which found that walking and cycling for either commuting 
or recreation were associated with reduced all-cause mortality. 
While the associations for more active travel with mortality have 
not previously been investigated in non-commuters, a systematic 
review examined the association between walking and cycling 
and mortality.17 In that review, of the five studies examining 
associations between active travel and all-cause mortality, only 
one found a significant association, which was observed for cycle 
commuting (walking on the commute was not examined in that 
study).
In terms of cancer outcomes, the associations we observed, 
although protective, were small and non-significant. Relatively 
few studies have described the associations between active travel 
and risk of incident or fatal cancers.26 Our non-significant find-
ings may reflect the small numbers of cases of breast and colon 
cancer (the cancers with which physical activity in general appears 
to be most strongly associated) and the short follow-up period 
relative to the aetiological time period of cancer development.
Implications for policy and practice
Taken together and in the light of existing evidence, our findings 
provide further support for a hypothesis that more active patterns 
of travel for both commuting and non-commuting purposes may 
be associated with significant reductions in CVD and all-cause

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
Key messages 
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Physical inactivity is an important risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease.
 
► Current clinical practice guidelines recommend physical 
activity, although the benefits of active travel on mortality 
and morbidity are still unclear.
What this study adds?
 
► We examined the association of active travel with mortality 
and morbidity in a cohort study.
 
► More active travel patterns were associated with significant 
reductions in cardiovascular disease (CVD).
 
► Those who used more active modes of travel for commuting 
and non-commuting purposes also had an even lower risk of 
fatal CVD.
 
► Among those who were not regular commuters, more active 
travel was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality.
how might this impact on clinical practice?
 
► This is important for clinicians advising people about how to 
be physically active and reduce their risk of disease.
mortality. This is an important message for clinicians advising 
people about how to be physically active and reduce their risk of 
disease. We also found no evidence that these associations were 
moderated by car access, which could be explained by the heter-
ogenous nature of the group who did not rely on car use, but it 
may also suggest that the benefits are available to all, irrespective 
of car access or distance to work.
Demographic and technological trends in countries such as 
the UK are thought likely to result in a reduced requirement for 
commuting over time and a dispersal of older people towards 
more rural areas,11 both of which will increase the importance 
of non-commuting travel. Interventions that encourage people 
to reduce their car use in favour of making more use of public 
transport, walking, cycling, or combinations thereof, may be 
more widely applicable than efforts to promote walking or 
cycling in particular, especially among people whose circum-
stances preclude, for example, cycling all the way to work, or 
giving up the car completely in a rural area. Our own previous 
research has highlighted the potential health gains associated 
with integrating walking or cycling stages into longer journeys by 
car or public transport,9 a target for public health intervention 
also supported by recommendations from the National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence,27 the UN and the WHO.28
Implications for future research
Longer term or more rigorous longitudinal analysis could 
investigate in more detail the extent to which changes in travel 
behaviour result in individual health benefits. Cohorts such as 
UK Biobank provide the opportunity to follow-up large numbers 
of people at regular intervals (not just at baseline) over a longer 
period of time, and the accrual of more cases of disease over 
time will increase the power to detect associations that may not 
have become apparent to date. Collecting more detailed infor-
mation about the frequency, duration and modal composition 
of trips, whether in this cohort or other future studies, would 
enable more definitive investigation of these associations and 
the extent to which they are modified by car access, distance or 
other factors.
