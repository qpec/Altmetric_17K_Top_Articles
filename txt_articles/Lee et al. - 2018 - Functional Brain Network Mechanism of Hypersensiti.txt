Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic widespread pain condition characterized by augmented multi-modal 
sensory sensitivity. Although the mechanisms underlying this sensitivity are thought to involve an 
imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory activity throughout the brain, the underlying neural network 
properties associated with hypersensitivity to pain stimuli are largely unknown. In network science, 
explosive synchronization (ES) was introduced as a mechanism of hypersensitivity in diverse biological 
and physical systems that display explosive and global propagations with small perturbations. We 
hypothesized that ES may also be a mechanism of the hypersensitivity in FM brains. To test this 
hypothesis, we analyzed resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) of 10 FM patients. First, we 
examined theoretically well-known ES conditions within functional brain networks reconstructed 
from EEG, then tested whether a brain network model with ES conditions identified in the EEG data 
is sensitive to an external perturbation. We demonstrate for the first time that the FM brain displays 
characteristics of ES conditions, and that these factors significantly correlate with chronic pain 
intensity. The simulation data support the conclusion that networks with ES conditions are more 
sensitive to perturbation compared to non-ES network. The model and empirical data analysis provide 
convergent evidence that ES may be a network mechanism of FM hypersensitivity.
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, 
memory and psychological disturbance1,2. Individuals with FM have alterations in brain structure, function, and 
neurochemistry that are thought to lead to the hyperalgesia and chronic pain commonly reported in this con-
dition3–6. Previous electroencephalogram (EEG) studies have also shown differences in power spectra obtained 
from FM patients and pain-free controls, suggesting alterations in brain network function such as thalamocorti-
cal dysrhythmia7–9. Along with this theory, increased hyper-excitability or hyperactivity of the nociceptive system 
has been proposed as a potential mechanism of clinical pain in FM4,10–13. There have been no explicit studies that 
explain, from a large-scale brain network perspective, how these objective signals interact to engender the sub-
jective sensation of chronic pain.
Hypersensitive responses to external stimuli, as displayed in FM patients, have been widely observed in 
various physical and biological systems such as cascade failures in a power-grid, abrupt state transitions in an 
electronic circuit and chemo-mechanical systems, epileptic seizures in the brain, and the sensitive frequency 
detection of the cochlea14–17. These systems all have a common characteristic whereby a small perturbation gives 
rise to explosive and global propagation in the system. A network property known as “explosive synchronization” 
(ES) has been studied as the underlying mechanism of abrupt state transitions within these types of systems and 
described as a discontinuous transition from an incoherent state to a synchronized state18–24. In a network that 
displays ES condition(s), a perturbation rapidly propagates across the whole network through synchronization. 
Our past work suggests that ES conditions are not present in the resting state of normal human brains25. We

hypothesized that ES may be a mechanism of FM hypersensitivity, with the expected result that FM patients with 
an enhanced ES condition would have greater network sensitivity and increased chronic pain.
To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the resting-state EEG network configurations of 10 FM patients 
and assessed (1) whether the FM brain network displayed characteristics of ES conditions (not found in nor-
mal humans), and (2) the correlation between the strength of ES conditions and chronic pain intensity (Fig. 1). 
For the ES conditions, we examined positive degree frequency correlation, large frequency difference, and large 
frequency disassortativity (a tendency of higher frequency nodes to link with lower frequency nodes or vice 
versa) between linked nodes in the networks18–24. These are typical network conditions shown to suppress gradual 
synchronization, suddenly triggering global synchronization around a critical point. Second, we tested whether 
these ES conditions produce hypersensitive network characteristics in response to stimulation. This network 
sensitivity was quantitatively compared between the human brain networks with ES and non-ES conditions using 
a frequency perturbation.
We demonstrate for the first time that the FM brain displays ES conditions. Furthermore, the degree of the 
ES conditions significantly correlated with the intensity of chronic pain. With computational models, we also 
demonstrate that brain networks with ES conditions are hypersensitive to a frequency perturbation. We conclude 
that ES may be a network mechanism underlying the hypersensitivity of the FM brain.
Materials and Methods
Participants and experiment protocol. 
This study was performed at the University of Michigan. All 
study participants gave written informed consent, and the study protocol and informed consent documents were 
approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (Ann Arbor, Michigan). We confirmed that 
all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. 17 FM patients (all 
females, age mean ±SD: 45.7 ± 11.4) were recruited as part of a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT01914679) evaluating 
Figure 1. Schematic diagram of study design. The study was composed of two parts, an experimental analysis 
section and a mathematical modeling section. The experimental phase was carried out by recording 64-channel 
electroencephalogram (EEG) of fibromyalgia (FM) patients. A functional network was constructed with the 
weighted phase lag index (WPLI) of the EEG signal, and power spectral density analysis was performed to 
obtain a node degree and frequency for each EEG channel. We then confirmed the relationship between the 
three ES conditions and the intensity of chronic pain. For the mathematical phase of the study, we generated a 
human brain network model based on the Kuramoto model and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The frequency 
configurations with ES and non-ES conditions were considered as the brain network states of high and low pain 
scores, respectively. These were used to explore the network sensitivity of ES and non-ES networks as tested with 
a frequency perturbation near the critical point.

a novel noninvasive brain stimulation device (Reduced Impedence Noninvasive Cortical Electrostimulation, 
RINCE) as a treatment for chronic pain. For this study, we analyzed only baseline EEG data, before any treat-
ments occurred. Ten out of seventeen patients’ data were used for the analysis. Seven subjects were excluded due 
to missing EEG data or high electromyogram or ocular movement artifact. Inclusion criteria were: FM patients 
who met the 1990 ACR diagnostic criteria for FM, female, and between the age of 18–65. Exclusion criteria were: 
current psychiatric disorder, history of suicide attempt in preceding 5 years, any history of bipolar disorder, schiz-
ophrenia or other psychotic disorder, a Hospital and Anxiety Depression score greater than 11 for either anxiety 
or depression, other chronic infection or condition that may cause pain, history of seizure disorder, pregnant or 
breastfeeding, history of alcohol or drug abuse, BMI greater than 40 kg/m2, or the use of stimulant medication, 
centrally active analgesics, or anesthetic or narcotic patches.
EEG recording. 
64-channel sensor net from Electrical Geodesics, Inc. (Eugene, OR) was used to acquire the 
EEG data with a sampling frequency of 500 Hz and the electrode impedance was kept below 50 KΩ.
The EEG protocol consisted of 10 minutes of resting state (5 minutes eyes open, 5 minutes eyes closed). 
Clinical pain was assessed immediately before the resting state period with a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) where 
“0” represented no pain and “100” represented the worst pain imaginable.
Noise and artifacts of the signals were automatically removed by the EEGLAB toolbox based on the power 
spectrum with a 10 dB threshold. In addition to the automatic rejection, we visually inspected the data and 
excluded artifacts. Independent component analysis (ICA) was also applied to the signals (function runica.m, 
EEGLAB, MATLAB toolbox, https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php) and removed components of eye move-
ments, cardiac signals, and focal noise. Noisy channels were also removed with a high-pass filter from 0.5 Hz, 
and 4-minute eyes closed artifact-free resting-state EEG signals were re-referenced to an average reference. We 
focused our analysis on the alpha frequency range (8–13 Hz) because it is the dominant peak frequency in the 
eyes-closed resting state.
EEG network analysis. 
To reconstruct the functional brain network, we used the weighted phase lag index 
(WPLI)26, which is a measure that captures phase locking between two signals with high robustness to volume 
conduction.

Zj  is the complex conjugate of Zj. Cij can be represented as Reiθ
, where R is magnitude and θ
 is the relative phase 
between signal i and j. If the phases of one signal i always lead or lag those of the other signal j, then WPLIij equals 
1. On the other hand, if the phase lead/lag relationship of two signals is perfectly random, the WPLIij value is 0.
We segmented the EEG signals into 10-s epochs with 2-s overlap. WPLI matrix was obtained for each 10-s 
window. We then took the average of WPLI matrices over all windows. A binary adjacency matrix Aij was con-
structed using the top 40% of averaged WPLI values among all channel pairs. If the WPLIij was included in the top 
40% of WPLI values, then Aij = 1, otherwise, Aij = 0. We then calculated the node degree, which is the number of 
connections of each node in the network. We tested several thresholds: 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70%; the analysis results 
are robust below 50% (See Supplementary Fig. S1).
EEG network configuration for ES conditions. 
First, we calculated the Spearman correlation between 
node degree and frequency, which has been identified as one of the network conditions for ES18. For each 10-s 
window, we calculated the power spectral density (PSD) for all channels (“pwelch.m” in MATLAB, with 2-s 
Hamming windows, 1-s overlaps, and frequency resolution = 0.2 Hz). At each window, we obtained the frequency 
that has median power within a frequency band. We took the average of the median frequency over all windows 
to calculate the correlation between node degree and frequency.
Next, the frequency difference Yij and the frequency assortativity Af between connected nodes were calculated 
to investigate the functional network conditions for ES19,21. The frequency difference Yij is defined as

where Yi and Yj are the median frequencies of the signal i and j, respectively. We used the average of frequency 
difference among connected nodes, <Yij> to evaluate the frequency difference of one individual. The frequency 
assortativity Af is a Spearman correlation between the node frequencies and the average frequencies of con-
nected neighbors in a network. If Af < 0, the higher frequency nodes tend to link with lower frequency nodes, 
or vice versa, which indicates that the frequency relationship between nodes in the network is diassortative. 
Furthermore, Spearman correlations were calculated to investigate the relationship between clinical pain scores 
and network sensitivities represented by the degree-frequency correlation, frequency difference and frequency 
assortativity for all subjects.
Lastly, we calculated the Spearman correlation between the pain score and the degree/median frequency of 
each channel for all patients. This was performed to determine which brain areas were associated with the pain 
score. We calculated z-scores of degree/median frequency over all channels for each subject. With the z-scores of 
each channel for all patients, we calculated the correlation between the pain scores and those z-scores. We consid-
ered a p-value less than 0.05 as statistically significant.

Human brain network models. 
A simple coupled oscillator, the Kuramoto model, was used to simulate

ij 
is constant and uniform, i.e., λ
ij = λ
. Aij is the connection matrix of the human DTI anatomical network. Aij = 1 if 
oscillators i and j are connected, and Aij = 0 if they are not. Each oscillator i is assigned a random initial phase θ
i, 
uniformly distributed between [−
π

] and a random initial frequency ω
i, drawn from some arbitrary distribu-
tion function g(ω
). The oscillators become spontaneously synchronized if λ
 is larger than a certain critical value.
We designed the natural frequency configurations g(ω
) to embody the network conditions that were con-
sistent with the empirical results of patients with varying pain scores. Specifically, empirical data were used to 
generate ES and non-ES networks as follows:
 i) We applied the perturbations to the highest degree nodes (1, 5, 10, 15, and 20). Here we only present the 
significant perturbation results of the 15 highest degree nodes (~18% of all nodes), which includes brain 
regions such as the putamen, insula, precuneus, thalamus, superior frontal and superior parietal regions27. 
The perturbation results and the names of the brain regions for the other highest degree nodes are present-
ed in Supplementary Fig. S2.

 iv) With the above conditions, we carried out the simulation of 100 configurations with positive degree-fre-
quency correlation, frequency difference >0.01, and frequency assortativity <−
0.25 as the high pain score 
condition, determined by empirical observation of the participants who had a pain score >42. We refer to 
those network conditions as the ES conditions.

have the same phase. The level of phase synchronization is determined by a time average of the order parameter 
after a transient period TΔ = 5000, Rlinked = 〈r(t)〉T, with the whole time period T = 10000. We observe the state of 
the network by increasing the coupling strength λ

Network sensitivity analysis. 
We introduced a frequency perturbation into the Kuramoto model slightly 
below the critical point to simulate external stimuli. We used the pair correlation function Cp, which has been 
used to quantify the susceptibility of statistical physics models29–31 to measure network sensitivity at a global level 
as well as to find the critical point of the network. The pair correlation function in the Kuramoto model is defined 
as,

part of z(t) in Eq. (4).
The pain-related brain regions such as insula, precuneus, superior frontal cortices, parietal cortices and the 
thalamus4,5,32,33 were perturbed as the target sites of the human brain network. The median frequency of the net-
work frequency configuration was given to the target sites to facilitate ES.
The network sensitivity Δ

where Cp(s0) and Cp(sp) are the pair correlation functions before and after the frequency perturbation, respec-
tively. The statistical difference of the network sensitivities between ES and non-ES networks was obtained by the 
sign test (p-value < 0.001 was considered as a significantly higher sensitivity in ES network).
Results
EEG network properties in FM patients. 
Figure 2(a) illustrates the relationship between the clinical pain 
intensities and the correlation coefficients between node degree and frequency for all subjects. A positive correla-
tion between node degree and frequency is known to be one of the network conditions for ES in a scale-free net-
work18. In the EEG data shown in Fig. 2(a), participants with pain scores higher than 42 had a tendency to have 
a positive correlation between node degree and frequency, suggesting conditions for ES. By contrast, the other 
subjects had negative correlations. Pain intensities of FM patients were positively correlated with the correlation 
coefficient between node degrees and median frequencies (Spearman correlation = 0.79, p < 0.01).
Figure 2(b) presents the exemplary cases of two individuals, one with the lowest and the other with the high-
est chronic pain intensity. For the FM patient with the highest pain rating (77 out of 100), nodes with larger 
degree also had higher frequencies (Spearman correlation = 0.38, p < 0.01). By contrast, the FM patient with 
the lowest paint intensity (=1) shows low correlation between node degrees and frequencies (Spearman correla-
tion = −
0.11, p > 0.05).
The frequency difference and the frequency assortativity of ten FM patients are presented with their associated 
chronic pain intensity rating in Fig. 3(a) and (b). A large frequency difference is another ES condition19,21 along 
with the positive degree-frequency correlation. Chronic pain intensity was significantly correlated with frequency 
difference between linked nodes in the network (Spearman correlation = 0.72, p < 0.05).
Large frequency disassortativity is another condition for ES identified in model networks23. Frequency disas-
sortativity is associated with frequency difference, but it accounts for the anti-correlation between the frequencies 
of linked nodes rather than just the absolute frequency difference. FM patients with greater chronic pain (>42) 
had frequency disassortativity wherein higher frequency nodes tended to link with lower frequency nodes. The 
opposite was observed for FM patients with lower chronic pain intensities (<42), where higher frequency nodes 
tended to link with higher frequency nodes (assortativity). The correlation between chronic pain intensity and 
frequency assortativities for the ten FM patients was −
0.59 (p = 0.08).
We observed large correlations of the degree-frequency correlation coefficient, frequency difference, and 
frequency assortativity with chronic pain intensity in the ten FM patients. However, the ES conditions were 
defined by the global relationship between structure (node degrees) and function (frequencies) of the EEG net-
work, rather than the node degree and frequency of each EEG channel. It is notable that the ES conditions were 
observed only in alpha band (8–13 Hz), whereas the other frequency bands: delta (0.1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), 
beta (13–25 Hz), and gamma (25–45 Hz), did not show any significant ES conditions (see Supplementary Fig. S3 
for the other frequency bands). Here, we measured which channel’s node degree or frequency is correlated with 
chronic pain, to identify the regional node degree and frequency attributes of the FM patients with high and low 
pain intensities.
Regional network properties with pain intensity. 
Figure 4 shows the Spearman correlation coefficients 
between the pain intensity and the z-values of node degree and median frequency. For the node degree, the left 
posterior area shows a correlation with the pain intensity (Spearman correlation = 0.66 with p < 0.05). For the 
Figure 2. Node degree and frequency are positively correlated with chronic pain intensity. (a) The degree-
frequency correlation coefficient positively correlates with the pain intensity. Each marker represents an 
individual. (b) The relationship between node degrees and median frequencies for all EEG channels from two

median frequency, the anterior and posterior regions demonstrate consistent large correlations with chronic pain 
intensity (Spearman correlation = 0.74 with p < 0.05 and 0.72 with p < 0.05, respectively). These data indicate 
that higher pain scores have higher median frequencies in anterior and posterior regions. This regional frequency 
attribute of the FM patients may contribute to ES network configurations such as positive degree-frequency cor-
relation, negative frequency-frequency correlation, and large frequency difference.
ES and non-ES network conditions. 
We established two anatomically informed human brain network 
models, one with ES and another with non-ES conditions, to test whether the human brain with ES conditions is 
associated with hypersensitivity to stimuli. Because it is known that the network topology significantly influences 
the network susceptibility18, we needed to quantitatively test the network sensitivity with an external perturba-
tion to human brain networks with states near critical points for both ES and non-ES conditions. Considering 
the network structure influence, Fig. 5(a) presents an example of frequency configuration used in an ES network 
model to simulate the EEG networks associated with higher pain intensity. Frequency mismatches between nodes 
were accomplished by having one subgroup of high degree nodes (L. caudate, L. and R. precuneus, superior 
frontal, superior parietal and insula) with higher frequencies and another subgroup of high degree nodes (L. and 
R. thalamus, putamen and hippocampus) with lower frequencies (see Materials and Methods); this mismatch 
created network conditions favoring ES. The relationship between the frequency and degree thereby forms a 
V-shape causing large frequency differences among the hub nodes as shown in Fig. 5(b) for the ES configuration 
(red circles). The property of frequency disassortativity for ES networks can be also naturally attributed by the 
Figure 3. Frequency difference and frequency assortativity are correlated with chronic pain intensity. (a) 
Frequency difference and (b) frequency disassortativity (negative assortativity) among EEG channels correlate 
with the pain scores. Each marker represents an FM patient.

V-shape relationship between frequency and node degree. Figure 5(c) demonstrates the network configurations 
we used for both ES and non-ES network models, including degree-frequency correlation, frequency difference, 
and frequency assortativity. The ES network has positive degree-frequency correlation, large frequency difference 
(>0.01), and large frequency disassortativity (<−
0.25). These conditions do not exactly match with the EEG 
data, but we simulated the essential factors to identify the influence on network sensitivity in the complex and 
hierarchical human brain network.
Network sensitivity. 
We tested the sensitivity of human brain network models with ES and non-ES condi-
tions. First, we assumed that the human brain in the resting state resides near the critical point of state transition, 
in which functional brain networks have the most complex interaction pattern, as well as the largest Cp
34. The 
state of the network was defined by the synchronization level across brain regions. A frequency perturbation was 
introduced at the critical point found for each network configuration, and the sensitivity of ES and non-ES brain 
network configurations was quantified. Figure 6(a) demonstrates the change of network synchronization Rlinked 
with increasing coupling strength (the only control parameter of the model). The ES and non-ES conditions pro-
duce distinctive synchronization patterns (Fig. 6a). The non-ES networks synchronize gradually, whereas the ES 
networks demonstrate delayed but steep synchronization. With the frequency perturbation, the ES network was 
more abruptly synchronized with a larger change of Rlinked than the non-ES network.
Figure 6(b) demonstrates the pair correlation function value Cp of ES and non-ES networks before and after 
the frequency perturbation. The critical coupling strength λ
c for each network configuration was determined by 
the largest Cp, which mirrors the most variable correlation pattern for a network. In comparison, the ES networks 
induce larger decreases of Cp than non-ES networks. This decreasing correlation function implies that the ES 
network gives rise to a more global propagation of synchronization from the perturbed node, strongly entraining 
different frequencies regionally distributed in the network.

brain network consisting of 82 brain regions. The asymmetric frequency distributions of the top 15 hub nodes

Table S1. (b) The relationships between node degrees and frequencies for the ES and non-ES conditions. The 
ES condition has a V-shape relationship, in which the hub nodes have large and small frequencies suppressing 
synchronization until a critical point (the key mechanism of ES), whereas the non-ES condition has a random 
relationship. (c) The brain network model with ES conditions has positive degree-frequency correlation 
coefficient, larger frequency difference, and negative frequency assortativity compared to non-ES condition.

(Cp) than the non-ES network (p < 0.001, sign test). 
The median sensitivity values of ES and non-ES networks were 1.08 and 1.64, respectively. The distributions of 
network sensitivity over 100 configurations for each network are shown in Fig. 6(d). The results suggest that if the 
brain network has an ES condition, the brain may be highly sensitive to stimuli.
Discussion
In this study, we hypothesized that chronic pain is associated with a highly sensitive functional brain network 
that results from conditions favoring rapid synchronization. From the empirical data, we found evidence that FM 
patients have brain network configurations with conditions for ES. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation 
between conditions for ES and the degree of clinical pain. These empirical findings support our hypothesis that ES 
can be a potential mechanism of hypersensitivity in the FM brain network. We also examined the specific brain 
regions that may subserve chronic pain by observing higher correlations between pain intensity and node degrees 
within posterior nodes and median frequencies in anterior and posterior regions. Although EEG lacks spatial

(a) Median synchronization level Rlinked vs. coupling strength λ
 of networks for ES and non-ES conditions 
before and after the perturbation. 100 different frequency configurations were implemented for the median 
Rlinked. The ES condition shows a steeper synchronization, and the perturbation induces larger synchronization. 
(b) Brain network susceptibility Cp vs. coupling strength λ
 for ES and non-ES conditions before and after 
the perturbation. ES conditions have larger Cp than non-ES conditions. The perturbation induces larger 
synchronization, which is measured as reduced Cp and with larger alternation of Cp in ES. The thick lines and 
shaded region indicate median Cp and standard error over 100 configurations. (c) The brain network containing 
the ES conditions shows significantly larger network sensitivity Δ(Cp) (p < 0.05), despite the large variances. 
The red line denotes the median Δ(Cp) over 100 configurations. (d) The variance of Δ(Cp) indicates the 
dependency of Δ(Cp) on the network configurations within each ES and non-ES condition. The blue (yellow) 
bar illustrates the number of network configurations with the same Δ(Cp). The blue (yellow) thick line indicates 
a fitted line for the distributions of Δ(Cp).

resolution compared with other neuroimaging modalities, higher frequencies of anterior and posterior regions 
seemed to be related to chronic pain intensity4.
Theoretically, the ES network could exhibit increased sensitivity to a specific external perturbation, but this 
has yet to be directly assessed in a network. Therefore, we tested whether an anatomically informed human brain 
network with ES conditions would be differentially sensitive to external stimuli. The brain networks generated 
had a complex modular structure, which can inhibit the occurrence of ES17. The comparison between ES and 
non-ES conditions demonstrated that the ES conditions can give rise to higher sensitivity to the stimulation 
even in a complex human brain network. These results suggest that ES may be one possible network mechanism 
involved in the hypersensitivity to external stimuli in FM brain networks.
Our findings of enhanced ES in FM may have relevance to previous EEG studies. Vanneste et al. found altered 
alpha power in FM patients as compared to pain free controls9. We also observed ES conditions specifically 
within the alpha frequency band in FM. Frequency-degree relationships within the alpha frequency band that are 
indicative of ES may play a role in the varying degrees of pain across individuals. Although not specifically tested 
here, the previously proposed thalamocortical dysrhythmia7 may also play a role in ES, as the thalamus was a 
sensitive node to stimulation in our brain network models. We also note that our findings are specific to the alpha 
frequency band as other bands did not show degree-frequency relationships with pain. This is in agreement with 
a lack of consistent EEG findings in other (non-alpha) frequency bands within FM7–9.
ES is a general phenomenon in nature that has been studied in physics since 2011 and that explains various 
physical and biological state transitions18–24. Recently, we identified ES conditions and abrupt synchronization 
transitions in human brain networks during the lightly anesthetized state25. As the anesthetic concentration 
crossed the threshold of unconsciousness, ES conditions developed in human brain networks, facilitating frequent 
and sudden state transitions between conscious and unconscious states. That study demonstrated for the first 
time that the network conditions for ES are present in empirically derived functional brain networks. Another 
computational model study demonstrated that, even though highly clustered brain networks inhibit ES, slight 
changes of network cluster structures facilitated the transition to a seizure state in the brain17. In addition, a recent 
model study showed that ES enhances frequency selectivity and signal-to-noise ratio of the cochlea16. These 
recent empirical and computational model studies indicate that ES can, indeed, take place during diverse state 
transitions in the brain.
In this study, we hypothesized that the hypersensitivity of the central nervous system in FM patients is asso-
ciated with an altered brain network configuration that displayed greater ES conditions. Our computational sim-
ulation generated both normal (non-ES) and abnormal (ES) brain networks. Networks with ES conditions were 
susceptible to perturbation at a critical point as expected and we assumed that both brain networks in the resting 
state may be residing near the critical points determined by the given network configurations. However, the 
brain network under ES conditions showed relatively abrupt state transitions accompanied by a large change 
of synchronization level. In addition, a perturbation immediately influenced global brain regions through syn-
chronization in the ES network. The ES was manifested as a discontinuous transition from an incoherent state to 
synchronized state when a small perturbation was introduced into to the system around the point of criticality.
With respect to treatment of FM, we expect that our study may ultimately suggest new approaches for anal-
gesic treatments. ES provides a theoretical framework and quantitative approach to test interventions that shift 
a hypersensitive brain network to a more normal brain network. This approach is conceivable, as Zhang et al. 
reported that an ES network can be modified into a non-ES network by inhibiting a small fraction of network 
activities22. Considering the characteristic hierarchical hub structure of the human brain network, it may be pos-
sible to convert an ES network to a non-ES network just by modulating one or two hub nodes. Indeed, transcra-
nial magnetic stimulation and/or transcranial direct current stimulation (both interventions shown to modulate 
chronic pain in FM) may be improved by “targeting” these sensitive hub nodes35,36; the application of deep brain 
stimulation to critical nodes that could modify ES conditions is another therapeutic possibility that could be 
explored.
Limitations. 
Our empirical data analysis and model study have several limitations. First, we did not use nor-
mal subjects as controls. Instead, we recruited the FM patients with various pain intensities ranging from 1 to 77. 
 
The FM patients with less pain (<42) were similar to our past study of healthy subjects with respect to their rest-
ing state data. In other words, we studied a subpopulation that did not have conditions for ES but future study 
with comparison to healthy controls is warranted. Second, scalp EEG assesses superficial brain activity and thus 
the empirical EEG analysis results cannot be directly compared with the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based 
network model that included cortical and subcortical areas. Magnetoencephalography or functional magnetic 
resonance imaging data with corresponding DTI data may be needed to link the empirical data to the network 
models directly. Third, in the brain network models, it is difficult to generate ES network configurations that 
satisfy all ES conditions at the same time in the same levels observed in the empirical data. Therefore, in the 
model study, we focused on frequency difference and frequency assortativity, which were more robust ES con-
ditions compared with the positive correlation between node degree and frequency. We implemented a V-shape 
relationship between frequency and node degree, which was suggested by Leyva et al.19 to produce similar levels 
of frequency difference and frequency assortativity with the results from the empirical data analysis. Fourth, 
the Kuramoto model is a simple coupled oscillatory model that was originally used for studying ES in model 
networks. For a more realistic simulation, a complex neural mass model that includes excitatory and inhibitory 
neuronal populations would improve upon the current brain network model of FM.
Conclusion
The empirical data analysis demonstrated that pain in FM patients correlates with the strength of ES conditions 
in functional brain networks reconstructed from high-density EEG. Moreover, the human brain network model

supported the hypothesis that network conditions for ES may give rise to hypersensitivity from a perturbation. 
The results suggest that ES can be a mechanism of a hypersensitive brain network in FM. Finally, we suggest that 
this could serve as a novel theoretical framework and quantitative approach to modulating chronic pain through 
the conversion of an ES brain network to a non-ES network using brain stimulation methods.
