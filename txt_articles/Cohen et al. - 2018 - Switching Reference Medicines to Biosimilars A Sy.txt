Abstract
Introduction To evaluate the possibility that switching
from reference biologic medicines to biosimilars could lead
to altered clinical outcomes, including enhanced immuno-
genicity, compromised safety, or diminished efficacy for
patients, a systematic literature review was conducted of all
switching studies between related biologics (including
biosimilars).
Methods A systematic search was conducted using the
Medline� and Embase� databases up to 30 June 2017
employing specific medical subject heading terms. Addi-
tionally, the snowball method and a hand search were also
applied. Publications were considered if they contained
efficacy or safety information related to a switch from a
reference medicine to a biosimilar. Non-English, non-hu-
man studies, editorials, notes, and short surveys were
excluded.
Results Primary data were available from 90 studies that
enrolled 14,225 unique individuals. They included protein
medicines used in supportive care as well as those used as
therapeutic agents. The medicines contained seven differ-
ent molecular entities that were used to treat 14 diseases.
The great majority of the publications did not report dif-
ferences in immunogenicity, safety, or efficacy. The nature
and intensity of safety signals reported after switching from
reference medicines to biosimilars were the same as those
already known from continued use of the reference
medicines alone. Three large multiple switch studies with
different biosimilars did not show differences in efficacy or
safety after multiple switches between reference medicine
and biosimilar. Two publications reported a loss of efficacy
or increased dropout rates.
Conclusions While use of each biologic must be assessed
individually, these results provide reassurance to healthcare
professionals and the public that the risk of immuno-
genicity-related safety concerns or diminished efficacy is
unchanged after switching from a reference biologic to a
biosimilar medicine.

 Keypoints
Scientific literature (1993 up to 30 June 2017) was
reviewed to identify publications that contained
primary data on single or multiple switching from
reference biological medicines to biosimilars.
A total of 90 studies were identified involving seven
molecular entities that treated 14 disease indications,
and enrolled a total of 14,225 individuals.
The great majority of studies did not report
differences in safety, efficacy, or immunogenicity
after a single switch event compared to patients that
were not switched. Only a small number (three) of
multiple switch studies have been published to date,
but likewise no differences were detected.
Overall, the results suggest a low risk of either a
safety concern or a loss of efficacy after switching to
a biosimilar.
1 Introduction
Biological medicines (biologics) are medicines made in
living systems. Biosimilars are copies of already licensed
biologics (referred to as the reference medicine) that are
highly similar, but that are made by different sponsors
using independently-derived cell lines and separately-de-
veloped manufacturing processes [1, 2]. Biosimilars can
only be approved if a manufacturer demonstrates that there
are no clinically meaningful differences in safety, efficacy,
and immunogenicity when directly compared with the
reference medicine [3].
The experience with the reference medicine, in both pre-
approval clinical trials and post-approval routine clinical
practice of medicine, provides a baseline for the safety and
efficacy expected for both reference medicines and their
corresponding biosimilars. To date, no new safety or effi-
cacy concerns have been detected in the over 10 years and
greater than 700 million days of patient experience with
biosimilars [4].
Nonetheless, concerns have been raised that switching
patients from reference medicines to biosimilars, or other
structurally-related
biologics,
may
lead
to
increased
immunogenicity and consequential safety problems, or
even a loss of efficacy. A review of switching studies
reported in the literature is an important first step to con-
firm or deny any existing pattern that may exist related to
biologic switching. Switches occur when patients receive
medicines formally designated as biosimilars, but may also
occur after manufacturing process changes have occurred,
if the process changes lead to structural modifications or
changes in the impurity profile of the biologic drug [5].
A commonly expressed concern is whether there is an
increase in immunogenicity related to the act of switching
itself. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) assays likely offer the
most sensitive method to detect immunogenicity; and
neutralizing antibodies (NAB) assays are the most direct
method to signal the potential clinical relevance of ADAs.
Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and certain safety events may
be
additional
measures
to
detect
clinically
relevant
immunogenicity.
Several product class or treatment specific literature
reviews of switching studies from reference medicines to
biosimilars have been published [6–8]. The aim of this
systematic literature review was to provide a single survey
that includes all switching studies of biologics to biosimi-
lars, providing a baseline in one manuscript of all switch-
ing studies published prior to 30 June 2017.
2 Methods
2.1 Data Sources and Searches
A systematic search using the Medline� and Embase�
databases up to 30 June 2017 was conducted. Medical
subject heading (MeSH) terms like ‘‘biosimilar pharma-
ceuticals’’ OR ‘‘biologic factors’’ were employed. A bio-
logical drug was included if a copy version of the reference
medicine was approved in either the USA or EU as a
biosimilar. Additional MeSH terms of all the smaller and
larger protein biologics (erythropoietin, human growth
hormone, filgrastim, etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab,
and rituximab) were added to the search string. This string
was combined with the MeSH term ‘‘drug substitution.’’ As
the medical subject heading ‘‘biosimilar’’ was first intro-
duced by National Center for Biotechnology Information in
2012 [9], further references within eligible papers were
also scrutinized for related evidence with the ‘‘snowball
method’’ [10, 11]. Additional hand search was applied
through citation review of identified articles.
2.2 Study Selection
Publications were considered if they contained efficacy or
safety information related to a switch from a reference
medicine to a biosimilar. Inclusion criteria were as broad as
possible to maximize capture of available data on switch-
ing. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational
studies that provide real world evidence (RWE) were both
included because they provide useful and complementary
information. Non-English, non-human studies, editorials,

 notes, and short surveys were excluded. Switching studies
from erythropoietin to darbepoetin; erythropoietin to
pegylated-erythropoietin;
and
insulin
to
insulin
were
excluded as they were out of scope of this review. An
experienced
researcher
was
involved
in
an
abstract
screening and subsequent full text screening steps to arrive
at articles with primary data for in depth literature review.
An assessment of study methods was not considered as a
screening parameter for a given publication. Figure 1
describes the step-by-step citation disposition.
2.3 Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
The selected full text articles were extracted for various
parameters such as study design, patient demographics,
safety, efficacy, immunogenicity, and adverse events (AEs)
and imported into MS Excel by one researcher and verified
by another researcher. Multiple reports from the same study
were identified by an experienced researcher by employing
methodology from the Cochrane Community [12]. Various
measures such as common author names, date, and duration
of the study, sample size, study location, and setting were
compared to detect such reports. As a next step, extracted
data from multiple reports of the same study were linked
together in an MS-Excel database and the collated infor-
mation for a particular study is presented in the Supple-
mentary Material tables. Citation of a full-text article with
complete study data was preferred over abstracts published
at an earlier date. In case of multiple abstracts describing
results from a single study but that contained mutually
exclusive data, an abstract was cited in tables that con-
tributed the most relevant data. Due to variability in indi-
vidual studies, a cross-study quality assessment was not
feasible and was therefore not conducted.
2.4 Data Synthesis and Analysis
The evidence tables (Tables 2 and 3) were the outcome of
the data synthesis and analysis step. The objective of these
analyses was to evaluate the possibility that switching from
reference biologic medicines to biosimilars could lead to
altered clinical outcomes. Tables were organized by
smaller and larger biologic proteins and disease indication.
Indication-wise
safety,
efficacy,
immunogenicity,
and
AE data are presented in supplementary tables (Supple-
mental Tables 1–11). Because of varying study designs,
endpoints, and statistical methodologies employed; no
effort was made to conduct a meta-analysis. Instead, all
endpoints are reported in a descriptive manner in order to
be inclusive.
3 Results
A systematic search resulted in 2,045 citations. As shown
in Fig. 1, after applying the exclusion criteria, 1,127 cita-
tions remained for the abstract screening step. After this
initial screening, 365 citations were short-listed for full text
screening. Short-listed full texts were scanned to select 151
articles for in depth literature review.

Clinical Outcomes After Switching from Reference Medicines to Biosimilars
465
 The molecular characteristics of the biologics varied
along a continuum as opposed to discrete categories
(Table 1) limiting the ability to correlate protein com-
plexity with any conclusions that might be drawn about
safety or efficacy. Biologics were arbitrarily divided into
smaller proteins and larger proteins for the sake of sim-
plicity. This yielded 57 studies of small protein biologics
(e.g., erythropoietin, filgrastim, human growth hormone) as
well as 94 studies of larger biologics (proteins C 200 amino
acids length, including fusion proteins [etanercept] and
monoclonal
antibodies
[adalimumab,
infliximab
and
rituximab])
that
contained
primary
safety,
efficacy,
immunogenicity and AE data.
Of the 94 selected articles or abstracts involving the
larger proteins, 54 contained primary data. The others were
either review articles, multiple reports from the same study
(N = 30) or briefing documents from regulatory bodies
(N = 10).
In addition to reference medicine to biosimilar switching
studies in smaller protein biologics, we identified 14
studies that enrolled 5,256 patients who were switched
from erythropoietin to darbepoetin. We also identified five
studies that evaluated switching from erythropoietin to
pegylated-erythropoietin that enrolled 1,941 patients (data
not shown). But since darbepoetin and pegylated-erythro-
poietin are versions of erythropoietin in which structural
modifications were made to extend product half-life, we
view these as switches between different products, and as
such these studies are out of scope of this review. In this
regard, we differ from an earlier review of smaller proteins
that included switching from originator biologics to both
biosimilars and proteins of the same product class [8]. Two
studies each reported unique data in two different publi-
cations; we only considered each study once. After
exclusion of these studies, there were 36 studies of smaller
proteins that contained switching data.
We identified 46 insulin-to-insulin switching studies that
enrolled over 20,000 patients (data not shown). These
studies were excluded from the review and analysis
because all insulin switching studies were conducted with
drugs approved as unique biologics and not as biosimilars.
Altogether, there were 90 studies of both smaller and
larger proteins that enrolled 14,225 unique individuals and
that contained primary switching data (Table 2; full ref-
erences are provided in Supplemental Table 12). They
included seven different molecular entities used to treat 14
diseases. Safety, efficacy, or immunogenicity endpoints
were incorporated into all studies, but only a limited
number of studies included all three categories. The exact
efficacy endpoints depended on the disease being treated.
All safety endpoints were descriptive. There has been a
steady growth in this literature from 1993 to the present
with rapid growth in 2015 and 2016 (Fig. 2). Seven
switching studies evaluated the use of a single biosimilar in
multiple patient populations who were being treated indi-
vidually for a variety of clinical conditions (Supplemental
Table 1).
The majority of the switching studies enrolled 30–60
subjects, although 33 studies (13 smaller and 20 larger
biologics) enrolled more than 100 subjects each. Eight
studies enrolled fewer than 20 patients but were included
for completeness and also because they often contained
patient-specific information. There were no published
reports

 biosimilar. Both RCTs and RWE are available in the lit-
erature with information on switching from reference
medicines to their corresponding biosimilar (Fig. 3). RCTs
provide detailed information from controlled clinical
experiments that apply specific inclusion and exclusion
criteria, while RWE studies provide data from all patients
that utilize a given drug, without the inclusion and exclu-

Many of the studies were pharmacokinetic (PK) or
pharmacodynamic (PD) studies conducted in healthy sub-
jects. As is common for PK and PD studies, these studies
enrolled smaller numbers of subjects than efficacy and
safety studies. However, confirmatory clinical efficacy and
safety studies in patients were often conducted as a part of
biosimilar development programs. Thirty-six publications

biologics after switching from reference medicines to the

 corresponding biosimilars (Table 3). Of these, 12 (33%)
were single arm studies describing patients that were
switched and the other 24 (67%) were cohort studies
comparing switched versus non-switched patients. In the
vast majority of these studies, overall efficacy was com-
parable in maintenance versus the switched groups, or was
maintained before and after the switching event in the
‘‘cohort
studies.’’
Sporadic
observations
of
loss
of
responses were reported in a few studies, such as Kang
et al. [13], who reported loss of efficacy in one of 17
patients in their study, but no consistent pattern occurred.
Multiple reports published of larger biologics focused
on safety endpoints, including AEs known to be associated
with reference medicines. Of the switching articles we
examined, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)
and treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs)
were reported in 39 studies (Table 3). An active switch
design was used in N = 13/39 studies (33%), while a
cohort design was employed in N = 24/39 of studies
(62%). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported as
‘‘Nil’’ (0%) in 32% of the studies.
The percentage of TEAEs and TESAEs in switch and
reference arms were comparable across disease indications
in seven articles that reported values for larger biologics.
There were 24 studies assessing ADAs in larger bio-
logics with seven also providing information on NABs
(Table 3, Supplemental Table 2). In the smaller biologics,
13 studies assessed ADAs of which four studies also
reported data on NABs. Diverse methods were used to
assess ADAs including radio-immunoassays, enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and electrolumi-
nescence assays. ADA rates varied depending on the type
of assay used, often for the same molecule. In all studies
reporting immunogenicity data, ADA and NAB levels were
found to be comparable at baseline and at the end of study
across all disease indications and treatment groups.
The Norwegian government sponsored a switching
study to assess safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of
patients switched to biosimilar infliximab from the refer-
ence medicine. The NOR-SWITCH study was a random-
ized, non-inferiority, double-blinded, phase IV trial in
patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases
(Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), psoriasis
(PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
and spondyloarthritis (SpA)) [14]. A total of 482 patients
who were on stable treatment with reference infliximab for
at least 6 months were randomized to either infliximab
reference medicine or a biosimilar (CT-P13). Of the
patients enrolled, 155 patients (37%) had CD and 91 (19%)
patients had UC. CT-P13 was non-inferior to the reference
medicine in respect to efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity
for the total study population. The study was not powered
to do sub-group analyses for individual diseases.
One report raised safety concerns after switching from
reference medicines to a biosimilar. Yazici et al. [15]
reviewed a Turkish claims database where 148 patients
were switched from reference infliximab to biosimilar
infliximab. They reported an 82% drop-out rate in patients
who were switched compared to a 24% drop-out rate in
control patients that remained on reference infliximab. It is
possible that these were chance results because no such
large differences in drop-out rates were seen in switched
versus control patients in the 46 other studies that evaluated
switching between these same biologics.
3.1 Switching Evidence from Arthritis Studies
Switching studies were conducted in multiple arthritic
conditions (Table 3, Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). Effi-
cacy
endpoints
included disease
activity scores
and
ACR20/50/70 (ACR, American College of Rheumatology,
20% response, 50% response, or 70% response to a com-
posite score) [16] to measure percent improvement in
tender or swollen joints after predefined time intervals
ranging from 14 to 102 weeks. Of note, switching data
were recently provided for two separately-developed
infliximab biosimilar antibodies approved for arthritic
indications: CT-P13 and SB2.
Regulatory approval for CT-P13 was supported with two
RCTs in two different indications, each of which incor-
porated a switching event and at least 1-year follow-up
[17, 18]. The first study was a phase I, randomized, double-
blinded study comparing PK, safety, and efficacy of
biosimilar and reference medicine in patients with AS. The
second study was a phase III double-blinded study that
evaluated safety and efficacy of CT-P13 and reference
medicine in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis co-
administered with methotrexate. There were no clinically
meaningful differences in safety and efficacy of CT-P13
compared to reference medicine. Comparable immuno-
genicity was observed in patients with RA or AS who
switched from reference medicine to CT-P13.
SB2 approval was supported by a phase III, randomized,
double-blinded, parallel group study, comparing it to
infliximab reference medicine in 584 patients with mod-
erate-to-severe RA with co-administration of methotrexate
[19]. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either SB2 or
reference medicine, with data available from 290 patients
at the end of the primary endpoint readout. After 54 weeks
of treatment, patients treated with reference medicine were
switched to SB2 and followed to 78 weeks. No changes
were detected in safety or efficacy.
An ongoing Danish registry study, DANBIO, is inves-
tigating switching from the reference infliximab to CT-P13
in patients with arthritic conditions [20]. Clinical outcomes
of patients with RA, PsA, and axial spondylitis who
Clinical Outcomes After Switching from Reference Medicines to Biosimilars
471
 switched from the reference medicine to the biosimilar
were investigated. After 12 months, 802 patients were
switched to the biosimilar; efficacy was consistent with
historical controls on the reference medicine. The observed
dropout rate of 16% was comparable to the rate observed
with historical controls of the reference medicine.
3.2 Switching Evidence from Inflammatory Bowel
Disease (IBD) Studies
Relatively few RCTs were conducted in IBD indications
to support registration of biosimilars. Prospective and
retrospective cohort studies (Supplemental Table 5) and
one RCT that included IBD patients (the NOR-SWITCH
study, discussed above) provided switching data that
showed no significant difference in efficacy, safety, and
immunogenicity when comparing IBD patients that were
switched to biosimilars with those that were treated con-
tinuously with reference medicines. Efficacy measures
included a variety of disease activity indices (e.g., CD
activity index, Harvey-Bradshaw index, Lichtiger’s Index
Score, pediatric Crohn’s disease activity index, pediatric
ulcerative colitis activity index and simple clinical colitis
activity index).
Fiorino et al. [21] conducted a prospective, multi-center
cohort study of CT-P13 (biosimilar infliximab) that enrol-
led 313 CD and 234 UC patients. Patients were either naı
¨ve
to anti-tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF) biolog-
ics (group A, N = 311), previously exposed to one or more
anti-TNF biologics (group B, N = 139), or previously
exposed to the reference version of infliximab (group C,
N = 97). Those previously exposed to one or more anti-
TNF biologics were on a median drug holiday of 9 months
for infliximab and 10 months for other anti-TNF biologics.
The remaining 97 patients on infliximab were switched
directly to CT-P13. The authors evaluated effectiveness
and safety parameters and reported outcomes comparable
to previous experience with reference infliximab, although
no direct comparisons were performed.
3.3 Switching Evidence from Psoriasis Studies
Five
switching
studies
were
conducted
in
psoriasis
(Table 3, Supplemental Table 6). Efficacy was assessed
using psoriasis area severity index (PASI) [22] and a visual
analogue scale (VAS). Psoriasis is considered a sensitive
indication for evaluation of anti-TNF biosimilar medica-
tions because skin responses to treatment are relatively
rapid with results that can be easily accessed and quanti-
fied; there is a large treatment effect size; dosing falls in the
linear phase of the dose response, which allows detection
of small differences in efficacy should they exist; and
biologics used to treat psoriasis are used as monotherapy,
avoiding complications associated with concurrent use
methotrexate and other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic
drugs [23].
Psoriasis phase III clinical confirmation studies were
conducted to support approval of biosimilar etanercept
(GP2015) and biosimilar adalimumab (ABP-501). For
GP2015, the sponsor conducted a phase III clinical con-
firmation
study
in
patients
with
moderate-to-severe
chronic, plaque-type psoriasis that incorporated three
switches [24]. The safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity
profiles of the switched and non-switched arms were sim-
ilar. It is one of the three multiple-switch studies published
to date and is discussed in detail below in the section on
multiple switching studies.
The phase III clinical confirmation study conducted with
ABP-501 in psoriasis patients treated 347 patients, with
174 treated with ABP-501 and 173 with reference medicine
[25]. After 16 weeks, the patients in the reference medicine
arm of the study were randomized 1:1 to either continue
reference medicine or to receive ABP-501. Patients were
then followed for 52 weeks. No increase in AEs was
observed and the incidence of ADAs remained unchanged
following switches from reference medicine to ABP-501.
3.4 Switching Evidence with Smaller Biologics,
Including Hematology–Oncology Therapies
Nineteen reports were identified that provided efficacy data
after switching from reference medicines to biosimilars in
smaller biologics (Table 3). These included filgrastim,
human growth hormone, and erythropoietin
Switching between the reference medicine and biosim-
ilar erythropoietins was studied in multiple indications,
including chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), and hemodialysis (HD) (Supplemental
Tables 7 and 8). The most common indication studied with
these drugs was CKD.
Of the seven CKD, two ESRD, and four HD endpoint
studies with erythropoietins, the most common efficacy
endpoint was a change in hemoglobin levels (Hb) over
time. Efficacy results were similar in all erythropoietin
studies, including stable mean Hb levels in the ESRD
studies.
Two switching studies were conducted using filgrastim
(Supplemental Table 9), using changes in absolute neu-
trophil count (ANC) and incidence of febrile neutropenia
(NP) as efficacy endpoints [26, 27]. The largest was a
phase 3 clinical confirmation study between a filgrastim
biosimilar (EP2006) and its reference [28]. This was a
randomized, double-blinded study in which 218 breast
cancer patients who received neoadjuvant myelosuppres-
sive chemotherapy were randomized in a double-blinded
setting to receive either a biosimilar or the reference
472

 medicine. The study incorporated five switches and is
discussed in more detail below.
Multiple human growth hormones are available in the
EU and US for rectifying deficiencies in human growth
hormone levels (GHD). Nine switching studies with human
growth hormones were published, with a cumulative total
of 470 patients (Table 3). Three of the studies enrolled
more than 100 patients each (Table 2). Efficacy endpoints
in GHD switching studies included height, height standard
deviation scores, and height velocity standard deviation.
Comparable efficacy and safety were seen after switching
from reference medicines to biosimilars in the seven GHD
studies that provided efficacy and safety data (Supple-
mental Table 10).
3.5 Switching Studies Conducted in Healthy
Volunteers
The literature review revealed ten switching studies con-
ducted in healthy volunteers (HV), using filgrastim, ery-
thropoietin,
and
human
growth
hormone
medicines
(Supplemental Table 11). Health authorities recommend
conducting pharmacokinetic or immunogenicity studies in
healthy adults because they are immunocompetent and
have physiological responses that are not compromised by
disease conditions or concomitant medications. As a result,
comparative studies in HVs may have greater potential to
detect differences in clinical response, should any exist,
compared to patients being treated for disease indications.
In all the switching studies conducted in HVs, safety pro-
files of individuals who received reference medicines and
then biosimilars were similar to safety profiles of individ-
uals who remained on reference medicines.
3.6 Multiple Switch Studies
As of 30 June 2017, only three multiple switch studies
have been published, one with a biosimilar filgrastim, the
second with a biosimilar etanercept and the third with a
biosimilar adalimumab. The third multiple switch study
was published after the data cut-off and so is not included
in the tally of studies or patients. However, given the
paucity of published multiple switching studies and the
importance of such studies to questions related to switching
and immunogenicity, we elected to include the third mul-
tiple switching study in the description of results.
In support of their biosimilar filgrastim registration, the
sponsor conducted a clinical safety and efficacy study that
incorporated five switchover events (Fig. 4), comparing
107 breast cancer patients that had been switched with 51
patients that had been treated continuously with either the
reference medicine or the biosimilar [28]. The results
showed no differences in efficacy or overall safety over the
course of the study. No NABs were detected in either arms
of the study.
A cross-over study design incorporating three switch-
over events (Fig. 5) was incorporated into the clinical
safety and efficacy study that supported licensure of
a biosimilar etanercept, GP2015 [24]. This was a phase III
clinical confirmation study in patients with moderate-to-
severe chronic plaque psoriasis. In the initial phase of this
study, 264 patients received GP2015 and 267 received the
reference medicine. After 12 weeks, each of the two arms
was further randomized 2:1 to continue the same treatment
or to receive the other medicine. The switched arms were
then switched several more times so that after 52 weeks of
follow-up, data were available from 178 patients who were
switched three times and from 274 patients who remained
on the same therapy throughout the study. The safety,
efficacy, and immunogenicity profiles of the switched and
non-switched arms were similar.
A third multiple switching study was published after the
cut-off date for this review. Biosimilar adalimumab
(GP2017) and reference medicine were compared in 231
adalimumab biosimilar versus 234 reference medicine
patients using a four-switchover study design similar to
that used to evaluate biosimilar etanercept (GP2015) in
moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis patients. Effi-
cacy, AEs and immunogenicity were similar for both drugs
after 51 weeks [29].
4 Discussion
This literature review was undertaken to see if switching
studies with biologics support or do not support the
hypothesis that the act of switching from reference
medicines
to
biosimilars is
associated
with
altered
immunologic responses. Of note, many biologics have been
used for many years and have undergone multiple manu-
facturing changes, which constitute de facto switches
[30, 31]. However, the literature we reviewed did not
address these as switches per se. That is, any individual
biologic is considered unchanged throughout its lifetime
for the purposes of the literature on switching.
Some, but not all, therapeutic proteins are inherently
immunogenic. Immunologic responses induced during
treatment with therapeutic biologics and their clinical sig-
nificance may be influenced by a wide variety of factors,
including medicine features, patient variables and treat-
ment parameters [32]. For example, infliximab and adali-
mumab are both known to induce ADAs [33].
The most direct measure of immunogenicity is by use of
validated immunoassays. Thirty-seven of the 90 studies
(41%, Table 3) reviewed contained immunoassay results. It
is also possible to obtain indirect information about
Clinical Outcomes After Switching from Reference Medicines to Biosimilars
473
 immunogenicity from efficacy studies, even in the absence
of immunoassay results. If NABs are elicited after
administration of a therapeutic protein, the resulting anti-
body-drug complex is often physiologically inactive or
may be cleared more rapidly resulting in diminished effi-
cacy. This lack of efficacy was not observed in the 53
studies that lacked immunoassay results. Little evidence for
increased immunogenicity and/or associated safety issues
were found during this review, consistent with recently
published expert opinions of health authority regulators
and physician consensus recommendations [34, 35].
The experience with the reference medicine is the best
source of data as to what immunogenicity may be expected
for a biosimilar. These data have been collected over at

 least a decade from pharmacovigilance monitoring of the
reference medicine, before approval of any corresponding
biosimilar.
The
most
important
concern
related
to
immunogenicity for all biologics are NABs that lead to
loss of efficacy. While the absolute ADA values cannot be
compared from one study to the next given the different
methodologies, patient populations and medicines asses-
sed, it is possible to draw comparisons within individual
studies, and conclusions from each study can be compared.
This was the approach utilized in this review.
An efficient immune response against therapeutic
proteins depends on the participation of T-cells. T-cell
activation, however, only occurs if a portion of the ther-
apeutic protein is presented to them as a relatively small,
linear peptide. Given that the primary structures of
biosimilars and reference medicines are identical, it fol-
lows that peptide epitopes presented to T-cells of the
immune system will be the same for both biosimilars and
their corresponding reference medicines. Any antibodies
developed against the protein backbone of the reference
can be expected to cross react with the corresponding
biosimilar, and vice versa. In case of differences in post-
translational modifications, it is possible that biosimilars
may contain unique epitopes that are not presented by
reference medicines and that are T-cell independent. It is
therefore important to study cross-reactivity in immuno-
genicity of biosimilars and reference medicines. Two
studies were published that evaluated the cross-reactivity
of antibodies to reference infliximab and biosimilar
infliximab [36, 37]. Both studies concluded that patients
who lose responsiveness to reference infliximab due to
ADAs will also respond poorly to biosimilar infliximab.
Not only is the infliximab biosimilar structurally, func-
tionally, and clinically similar to the reference infliximab,
but these studies confirm that the same is true for the
immune responses elicited.
This review of the published switching studies also did
not show loss of efficacy related to switching from refer-
ence medicines to biosimilars. Similarly, there were no
new AEs detected in any of the published switching studies
that were not already known from studies of the reference
medicine. The incidence of safety events in all reported
studies was the same before and after the switching event.
There is an oft-cited example of increased pure-red cell
aplasia (PRCA) that was observed after a major change of a
formulation to a marketed erythropoietin [38]. The change
included the elimination of the human serum albumin
stabilizer from the drug product, which subsequently led to
high levels of impurities leaching from the primary pack-
aging. It was established that the PRCA events were caused
by an increase in inherent immunogenicity of the medicine.
The
manufacturer
introduced
a
number
of
product
improvements that restored low immunogenicity [39, 40].
A recent literature case report presented data on an
individual that developed serum sickness-like disease
after switching from reference medicine to biosimilar
infliximab [41]. Serum sickness is a hypersensitivity
reaction, commonly occurring a few days to 2 weeks after
exposure to a foreign protein or serum component. While
this case may be temporally plausible, serum sickness-like
disease is already reported as a potential AE that may be
encountered after extended treatment with infliximab
[42]. Although we lack definitive evidence for this case
report to ascertain whether or not this case was triggered
by the switch, this case report highlights the need to
continue to be vigilant in monitoring the safety of all
protein-based therapies.
Kang et al. [13] and Yazici et al. [15] report loss of
efficacy or high drop-out rates after switching from refer-
ence medicine to biosimilar infliximab. Certainly all such
reports need to be considered carefully to determine if there
is an emerging signal or pattern. But we note that the
results of Kang et al. and Yazici et al. were not replicated
in other studies of switching from reference infliximab to
biosimilar infliximab. Given that the vast majority of other
studies, irrespective of design or size, do not show
immunogenicity or signs of intolerance after switching
from reference biologic to biosimilar, it is most likely that
these two reports are outliers.
Most studies only evaluated a single switch from ref-
erence biologic to a biosimilar. Suggestions have been
made that there may be an increased safety risk if patients
are switched back and forth multiple times between refer-
ence biologic and biosimilar. But while the field of
biosimilars is new, biologic drugs have been used by
patients for decades. Patients have already been exposed to
de facto multiple switches for many originator biologics
when product quality attributes changed after one or more
manufacturing
process
modifications
were
introduced
[30, 31]. Additional multiple switching studies with
biosimilars will directly address this theoretical concern,
but at present there is no evidence available that such
switches will impact either safety or efficacy. The US Food
and Drug Administration has recently issued a draft guid-
ance describing the data requirements necessary to estab-
lish
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
pharmacist
initiated
switching (known in the USA as ‘‘interchangeability’’),
suggesting that manufacturers conduct a clinical study with
multiple switches and that utilizes PK or PD primary
endpoints, with efficacy parameters as secondary endpoints
and safety provided in a descriptive manner [43]. Three
multiple switching studies have been reported, each with a
different biosimilar. These studies were completed before
the draft guidance was issued and do not meet all the
design recommendations of the draft guidance because
they used efficacy measures as their primary endpoints,
Clinical Outcomes After Switching from Reference Medicines to Biosimilars
475
 instead of PK or PD measures. Nonetheless, the results of
these three multiple switching studies do not reveal any
safety or efficacy concerns with multiple switches.
Inotai et al. [44] utilized a different approach to assess
the concerns expressed in the literature about switching
from reference medicines to biosimilars. They identified all
articles in which concerns were raised, and then sought to
identify evidence supporting these assertions. They con-
cluded that while the hypothetical risk is valid, the asser-
tions
have
not
been
supported
by
‘‘solid
scientific
evidence.’’ The extensive review of existing literature as
reported here supports this conclusion as well.
4.1 Limitations
An important limitation of this literature review was the
variability in methods used by individual studies. By
design, this review was designed to be inclusive and as
such did not censor reports based on completeness of
method description or the rigor in which the studies were
executed. Abstracts were included when they were the sole
source of data for a given study, but abstracts often lack
sufficient details to allow for a full assessment of
methodology used. Furthermore, evaluation of the quality
of the methods of an individual study is itself subjective;
and it was not possible to create non-subjective inclusion/
exclusion criteria based on the descriptions of study
methods provided in the publications.
The majority of the studies were descriptive in nature
and were not powered or designed to detect switch-related
differences. As a result, it was not possible to pool the
studies in a meta-analysis for either safety or efficacy
endpoints.
The small size or the lack of statistical analyses con-
ducted for some studies are limitations that might lead
some to dismiss results from those studies; but we elected
to include them because descriptive analyses are still a
valid comparative tool.
5 Conclusions
There is a large body of published evidence for biologic
medicines evaluating the impact of switching from refer-
ence medicines to biosimilars that assesses immunogenic-
ity, efficacy, and safety. As of 30 June 2017, 90 switching
studies were published with varying study designs, end-
points, and medicines. These included studies in 17 disease
indications, in patients and in healthy volunteers, com-
prising a total of 14,225 subjects. While there are limita-
tions to some of the individual studies, the cumulative
results of these published data do not show significant
differences in ADAs or NABs after switching compared to
subjects that were not switched. There were also no
reported increases
in treatment-related safety
events,
including loss of efficacy, that were related to the act of
switching from reference medicines to corresponding
biosimilars. Thus, the extensive data collected to date
suggest that the act of switching from a reference medicine
to a biosimilar is not inherently dangerous, and that
patients, healthcare professionals, and the public should not
assume that it is problematic. As with all biologics, con-
tinued pharmacovigilance is important to monitor for rare
safety events and for unexpected changes in efficacy or
safety profiles that may occur after a manufacturing pro-
cess change. Furthermore, continued and thorough phar-
macovigilance for all biologics should increase confidence
of patients, healthcare professionals, and the public in
biosimilars, leading to increased acceptance of these safe
and effective medicines.
